The spatially homogeneous Landau (or Fokker-Planck-Landau) equation\ncorresponds, in dimension d \u2265 2, to the case where for some \u03ba : R+ 7\u2192 R+ ,\n\n(2)\n\naij (z) = \u03ba(|z|2 )(|z|2 \u03b4ij \u2212 zi zj ).\n\nPhysically, one assumes that \u03ba(r) = r\u03b3/2 , for some \u03b3 \u2208 [\u22123, 1]. One talks of soft potentials when\n\u03b3 < 0, Maxwell molecules when \u03b3 = 0, and hard potentials when \u03b3 > 0. We consider in this paper\nthe case of Maxwell molecules, or of pseudo-Maxwell molecules, where \u03ba is supposed to be smooth\nand bounded.\nThis equation arises as a limit of the Boltzmann equation when all the collisions become grazing.\nWe refer to Villani [10, 11, 12] and the many references therein for physical and mathematical details\non this topic.

Consider a : Rd 7\u2192 Sd+ . Let b : Rd 7\u2192 Rd be defined by bi (x) = j=1 \u2202j aij (x).\nAssume that |a(x)| + |b(x)| \u2264 C(1 + |x|2 ) (which is the case when a is defined by (2) with \u03ba \u2208\nCb1 ). A measurable family (Pt )t\u22650 \u2282 P2 is said to be a weak solution to (1) if for all t \u2265 0,\nsup[0,t] m2 (Ps ) < \u221e and for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cb2 (Rd ),\nZ t Z Z\nZ\nZ\nds\n\u03c6(x)P0 (dx) +\n\u03c6(x)Pt (dx) =\nPs (dx)Ps (dy)L\u03c6(x, y),\n(3)\nRd\n\nRd\n\nwhere L\u03c6(x, y) =\n\nPd\n1\n\n2\n\ni,j=1\n\n2\naij (x \u2212 y)\u2202ij\n\u03c6(x) +\n\n0\n\nPd\n\nRd\n\ni=1 bi (x\n\nRd\n\n\u2212 y)\u2202i \u03c6(x).\n\nAll the terms make sense due to our conditions on a, b, Pt . See Villani [11] for a similar formulation.\n1.3. Known results. To our knowledge, the first (and only) paper proving a rate of convergence\nfor a numerical scheme to solve (1) is that of Fontbona-Gu\u00e9rin-M\u00e9l\u00e9ard [4]. Their method relies\non a stochastic particle system. The aim of this paper is to go further in this direction.\nLet us thus recall briefly the method of [4], relying on the probabilistic interpretation of (1)\ndevelopped by Funaki [6], Gu\u00e9rin [7].\nLet \u03c3 : Rd 7\u2192 Sd+ and b : Rd 7\u2192 Rd be Lipschitz continuous functions, and let P0 \u2208 P2 . A Rd -valued\nprocess (Xt )t\u22650 is said to solve E0 (P0 , \u03c3, b) if L(X0 ) = P0 , and if for all t \u2265 0, setting Pt = L(Xt ),\nZ tZ\nZ tZ\n(4)\nXt = X0 +\n\u03c3(Xs \u2212 x)WP (dx, ds) +\nb(Xs \u2212 x)Ps (dx)ds.\n0\n\nRd\n\n0\n\nRd\n\nHere WP (dx, dt) is a Rd -valued white noise on [0, \u221e) \u00d7 Rd , independent of X0 , with independent\ncoordinates, each of which having covariance measure Pt (dx)dt (see Walsh [14]).\nExistence and uniqueness in law for E0 (P0 , \u03c3, b) have been proved in Gu\u00e9rin [7]. If furthermore\nPd\n\u03c3(x)\u03c3 \u2217 (x) = a(x) and bi (x) = j=1 \u2202j aij (x), then (Pt )t\u22650 is a weak solution to (1). The condition\nthat \u03c3 and b are Lipschitz continuous is satisfied in the case of the Landau equation for Maxwell\nor pseudo-Maxwell molecules.\nIn [4], one considers an exchangeable stochastic particle system (Xti,n )t\u22650,i=1,...,n , satisfying a\nS.D.E. driven by n2 Brownian motions. It is then shown that one may find a coupling between a\nsolution (Xt1 )t\u22650 to E0 (P0 , \u03c3, b) and such a particle system in such a way that\n\"\n#\nE sup |Xt1,n \u2212 Xt1 |2 \u2264 CT n\u22122/(d+4) ,\n[0,T ]\n\nunder the condition that P0 has a finite moment of order d+5. The proof relies on a clever coupling\nbetween the the white noise and n Brownian motions. In particular, one has to assume that Pt\nhas a density for all t > 0, in order to guarantee the uniqueness of some optimal couplings.\n1.4. Another approach. For a : Rd 7\u2192 Sd+ , b : Rd 7\u2192 Rd satisfying |a(x)| + |b(x)| \u2264 C(1 + |x|2 )\nand \u03bc \u2208 P2 (Rd ), we introduce\nZ\nZ\na(x, \u03bc) =\na(x \u2212 y)\u03bc(dy), b(x, \u03bc) =\nb(x \u2212 y)\u03bc(dy).\nRd\n\nRd\n\nFor each x \u2208 Rd , \u03bc \u2208 P2 , a(x, \u03bc) is a nonnegative symmetric matrix and thus admits an unique\n1\n1\nsymmetric nonnegative square root a 2 (x, \u03bc) := [a(x, \u03bc)] 2 .\nDenote by Wd the law of the d-dimensional Brownian motion, consider P0 \u2208 P2 , and let (X0 , B) \u223c\nP0 \u2297 Wd . We say that a Rd -valued process (Xt )t\u22650 solves E1 (P0 , a, b) (or E1 (P0 , a, b, X0 , B) when\n\n\fPARTICLE APPROXIMATION OF SOME LANDAU EQUATIONS\n\n3\n\nneeded) if E[sup[0,T ] |Xt |2 ] < \u221e for all T and if for all t \u2265 0, setting Pt = L(Xt ),\nZ t\nZ t\n1\n(5)\nXt = X0 +\na 2 (Xs , Ps )dBs +\nb(Xs , Ps )ds.\n0\n\n0\n\nThis equation is nonlinear in the sense that its coefficients involve the law of the solution. Compared\nto (4), equation (5) is simpler, since it is driven by a finite-dimensional Brownian motion, and since\nthe nonlinearity does not involve the driving process. However, one may check that at least formally,\nsolutions to (4) and (5) have the same law. The link with (1) relies on a simple application of the\nIt\u00f4 formula.\nP\nRemark 2. Let (Xt )t\u22650 solve E1 (P0 , a, b). Assume that bi = dj=1 \u2202j aij , and that |a(x)|+|b(x)| \u2264\nC(1 + |x|2 ). Then (Pt )t\u22650 := (L(Xt ))t\u22650 is a weak solution to (1).\nThe natural linearization of (5) consists of considering n particles (Xti,n )t\u22650,i=1,...,n solving\n!\n!\nZ t\nZ t\nn\nn\n1X\n1\n1X\ni,n\ni,n\ni\ni\ni,n\n(6)\nXt = X0 +\na 2 Xs ,\nb Xs ,\n\u03b4 k,n dBs +\n\u03b4 k,n ds.\nn 1 Xs\nn 1 Xs\n0\n0\n\nHere (X0i , B i )i=1,...,n are i.i.d. with law P0 \u2297 Wd . We thus use n Brownian motions. When\nlinearizing (4), one needs to use n2 Brownian motions, since the white noise is infinite dimensional.\nHowever, one may check that the solution to (6) and the particle system built in [4] have the same\ndistribution (provided \u03c3\u03c3 \u2217 = a in [4, Equation (4)]).\n1.5. Main results. The main result of this paper is the following.\n\nTheorem 3. Assume that b is Lipschitz continuous, that a is of class C 2 , with all its derivatives\nof order 2 bounded, and that P0 \u2208 P2 .\n(i) There is strong existence and uniqueness for E1 (P0 , a, b): for any (X0 , B) \u223c P0 \u2297 Wd , there is\nan unique solution (Xt )t\u22650 to E1 (P0 , a, b, X0 , B).\n(ii) Let (X0i , B i )i=1,...,n be i.i.d. with law P0 \u2297 Wd . There is an unique solution (Xti,n )t\u22650,i=1,...,n\nto (6). Assume that P0 \u2208 P4 , and consider the unique solution (Xt1 )t\u22650 to E1 (P0 , a, b, X01, B 1 ).\nThere is a constant CT depending only on d, P0 , a, b, T such that\n#\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ T\n1,n\n1 2\nmin n\u22121/2 , n\u22121 sup (1 + |a(x, Pt )\u22121 |) dt \u2264 CT n\u22121/2 .\n(7)\nE sup |Xt \u2212 Xt | \u2264 CT\n[0,T ]\n\n0\n\nx\u2208Rd\n\nIn the general case, we thus prove a rate of convergence in n\u22121/2 , which is faster than n\u22122/(d+4) .\n1\nIf we have some information on the nondegeneracy of a(x, Pt ), then a 2 (x, \u03bc) is smooth around\n\u03bc \u2243 Ps , and we can get a better rate of convergence.\nAssume for example that a is uniformly elliptic (which is unfortunately not the case of (2), since\na(x)x = 0 for all x \u2208 Rd ). Then supx |a(x, Pt )\u22121 | \u2264 supy |a(y)\u22121 | < \u221e, and we get a convergence\nrate in n\u22121 .\nIn the case of the Landau equation for true Maxwell molecules, we obtain the following result.\nCorollary 4. Consider the Landau equation for Maxwell molecules, where a is given by (2) with\nPd\n\u03ba \u2261 1 and bi (x) = j=1 \u2202j aij (x) = \u2212(d \u2212 1)xi . Then a, b satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 3.\nLet P0 \u2208 P4 , and adopt the notation of Theorem 3-(ii).\n(i) We have E[sup[0,T ] |Xt1,n \u2212 Xt1 |2 ] \u2264 CT n\u22121 (1 + log n).\nR\n(ii) Set x0 = xP0 (dx). If a(x0 , P0 ) is invertible, then E[sup[0,T ] |Xt1,n \u2212 Xt1 |2 ] \u2264 CT n\u22121 .\n\nWe finally consider the case of pseudo-Maxwell molecules.\n\n\f4\n\nNICOLAS FOURNIER\n\nCorollary 5. Consider the Landau equation for pseudo-Maxwell molecules, where a is given by (2)\nPd\nwith \u03ba \u2208 C 2 (R+ ), and bi (x) = j=1 \u2202j aij (x) = \u2212(d \u2212 1)\u03ba(|x|2 )xi . Assume that \u03ba\u2032 has a bounded\nsupport. Then a, b satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 3-(ii).\nR\nAssume furthermore that P0 \u2208 P4 has a density with a finite entropy P0 (x) log P0 (x)dx < \u221e,\nand that \u03ba is bounded below by a positive constant.

Plan of the paper. In Section 2, we give the proofs of Theorems 3 and 6. Section 3 is\ndevoted to the proofs of Corollaries 4 and 5.\nIn Section 4, we briefly deal with the case of soft potentials, but our theoritical results do not\nextend well. Numerical results are given in Section 5. Finally an appendix lies at the end of the\npaper.\n\n2. General proofs\nIn the whole section, we assume that P0 \u2208 P2 , that a : Rd 7\u2192 Sd+ is of class C 2 , with bounded\nderivatives of order two, and that b : Rd 7\u2192 Rd is Lipschitz continuous. We denote by C (resp.\nCT , CT,p ) a constant which depend only on a, b, d, P0 (resp. additionally on T , on T, p) and whose\nvalue may change from line to line.\n\b \u0002\n\u0003\nFor \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 P2 , we set W22 (\u03bc, \u03bd) = min E |X \u2212 Y |2 ; L(X) = \u03bc, L(Y ) = \u03bd . See Villani [13] for\nmany informations on the Wasserstein distance W2 .\n\n\fPARTICLE APPROXIMATION OF SOME LANDAU EQUATIONS\n\n5\n\n2.1. Preliminaries. Our results are mainly based on the two following Lemmas.\nLemma 7. For all \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 P2 , all x, y \u2208 Rd ,\n1\n\n1\n\n|a 2 (x, \u03bc) \u2212 a 2 (y, \u03bd)|2 + |b(x, \u03bc) \u2212 b(y, \u03bd)|2 \u2264 C(|x \u2212 y|2 + W22 (\u03bc, \u03bd)),\n1\n\n|a 2 (x, \u03bc)|2 + |b(x, \u03bc)|2 \u2264 C(1 + m2 (\u03bc) + |x|2 ).\n\n+\nd\nProof. Step 1. For\nR \u03bc \u22082 P2 fixed, we consider the map A : R 7\u2192 Sd defined by A(x) = a(x, \u03bc).\n2\nThen D A(x) = Rd D a(x \u2212 y)\u03bc(dy), is clearly uniformly bounded. Lemma 10 ensures us that\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n||D(A 2 )||\u221e is uniformly bounded, so that |a 2 (x, \u03bc) \u2212 a 2 (y, \u03bc)| = |A 2 (x) \u2212 A 2 (y)| \u2264 C|x \u2212 y|.\n\nStep 2. We now fix x \u2208 Rd , and consider \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 P2 . We introduce a couple (X, Y ) of random\nvariables such that L(X) = \u03bc, L(Y ) = \u03bd, and W22 (\u03bc, \u03bd) = E[|X \u2212 Y |2 ]. We define A : R 7\u2192 Sd+ by\nA(t) = E [a(x \u2212 [tX + (1 \u2212 t)Y ])]. Then A(0) = E[a(x \u2212 Y )] = a(x, \u03bd) while A(1) = E[a(x \u2212 X)] =\na(x, \u03bc). Furthermore,\n|D2 A(t)| = |E[|X \u2212 Y |2 D2 a(x \u2212 [tX + (1 \u2212 t)Y ])]| \u2264 ||D2 a||\u221e E[|X \u2212 Y |2 ] = CW22 (\u03bc, \u03bd).\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nLemma 10 ensures us that ||(A 2 )\u2032 ||\u221e \u2264 CW2 (\u03bc, \u03bd), so that |a 2 (x, \u03bc) \u2212 a 2 (x, \u03bd)| = |A 2 (1) \u2212\n1\nA 2 (0)| \u2264 CW2 (\u03bc, \u03bd).\n1\n\nStep 3. The growth estimate (for a) follows from the Lipschitz estimate, since |a 2 (0, \u03b40 )|2 =\n1\n|a 2 (0)|2 < \u221e, and since W22 (\u03bc, \u03b40 ) = m2 (\u03bc).\nStep 4. The case of b is much simpler. For \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 P2 , we introduce X, Y as in Step 2. Then\n|b(x, \u03bc) \u2212 b(y, \u03bd)|2 = |E[b(x \u2212 X) \u2212 b(y \u2212 Y )]|2 \u2264 C(|x \u2212 y|2 + E[|X \u2212 Y |]2 ) \u2264 C(|x \u2212 y|2 + W22 (\u03bc, \u03bd)).\nThe growth estimate follows from the Lipschitz estimate, since |b(0, \u03b40 )|2 = |b(0)|2 < \u221e.\n\u0003\nLemma 8.

Recall here that a is given by (2) with \u03ba \u2261 1 and b(z) = \u2212(d \u2212 1)z. Thus b\nis Lipschitz continuous, and the second derivatives of a are clearly bounded. We consider a weak\nsolution (Pt )t\u22650 to (1).\nR\nSimple computations using (3) (with \u03c6(x) = xi , \u03c6(x) = |x|2 ) show that\nR \u2202t xPt (dx)\nR = 0 and\n\u2202t m2 (Pt ) = 0. We classically may assume without loss of generality that xPt (dx) = xP0 (dx) =\n0. We also assume that m2 (Pt ) = m2 (P0 ) > 0 (else Xt1 = Xt1,n = 0 a.s.).\nWe now bound from below (a(x, PtR)y, y) for x, y \u2208 Rd , t \u2265 0.\nA simple computation, using that xPt (dx) = 0, shows that a(x, Pt ) = a(x) + a(0, Pt ). Thus for\nR\nall t \u2265 0, x, y \u2208 Rd , setting mij\nxi xj Pt (dx)\n2 (Pt ) =\nX\nX\n2\nyi yj mij\nyi yj [m2 (Pt )\u03b4ij \u2212 mij\n(a(x, Pt )y, y) \u2265 (a(0, Pt )y, y) =\n2 (Pt ).\n2 (Pt )] = m2 (P0 )|y| \u2212\ni,j\n\ni,j\n\nUsing (3) with \u03c6(x) = xi xj , we deduce that\nWe thus obtain\n\nij\nij\n\u2202t mij\n2 (Pt ) = 2m2 (Pt )\u03b4ij \u2212 2dm2 (Pt ) = 2m2 (P0 )\u03b4ij \u2212 2dm2 (Pt ).\n\n\u2202t (a(0, Pt )y, y) = \u2212\n\nX\ni,j\n\nyi yj \u2202t mij\n2 (Pt ) = 2d\n\nX\ni,j\n\n2\nyi yj mij\n2 (Pt ) \u2212 2m2 (P0 )|y|\n\n=2(d \u2212 1)m2 (P0 )|y|2 \u2212 2d(a(0, Pt )y, y).\n\n\fPARTICLE APPROXIMATION OF SOME LANDAU EQUATIONS\n\nSet \u03bb0 = inf{(a(0, P0 )y, y), |y| = 1} \u2265 0 and \u03bb1 =\n\nd\u22121\nd m2 (P0 )\n\n9\n\n> 0.

We deduce that\n\n(a(x, Pt )y, y) \u2265 |y|2 (\u03bb0 e\u22122dt + \u03bb1 (1 \u2212 e\u22122dt )) \u2265 min(\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 )|y|2 /2.\n\nAs a consequence, |a(x, Pt )\u22121 | \u2264 2/ min(\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 ).

Recall here that aij (x) = \u03ba(|x|2 )(|x|2 \u03b4ij \u2212 xi xj ) and that b(x) = \u2212(d \u2212\n1)\u03ba(|x|2 )x, that \u03ba is C 2 and that \u03ba\u2032 has a bounded support, so that a has bounded derivatives of\norder 2, and b is Lipschitz continuous. We consider a weak solution (Pt )t\u22650 to (1). As previously,\nwe classically have m2 (Pt ) = m2 (P0 ). Furthermore,\nit is again\nR\nR classical and widely used that the\nentropy of Pt is non-increasing, so that Pt (x) log Pt (x)dx \u2264 P0 (x) log P0 (x)dx = C < \u221e for all\ntimes, see Villani [10, 11, 12].\nIf we prove that there is \u03bb0 > 0 such that for all t \u2265 0, x, y \u2208 Rd , (a(x, Pt )y, y) \u2265 \u03bb0 |y|2 , then we\ndeduce that |a(x, Pt )\u22121 | is uniformly bounded, so that the Corollary follows from (7).\nObserve that setting \u03b1ij (x) = |x|2 \u03b4ij \u2212 xi xj , we have (a(x, Pt )y, y) \u2265 \u03bb1 (\u03b1(x, Pt )y, y), where\n\u03bb1 > 0 is a lowerbound of \u03ba. But it is shown in Desvillettes-Villani [3, Proposition 4] that for\nE0 \u2208 R+ , H0 \u2208 R+ , there is a constant\nR cE0 ,H0 > 0 such that for any probability density function\nf on Rd such that m2 (f ) \u2264 E0 and f (x) log f (x)dx \u2264 H0 , (\u03b1(x, f )y, y) \u2265 cE0 ,H0 |y|2 . Actually,\nthey consider the case where \u03b1ij (x) = |x|\u03b3 (|x|2 \u03b4ij \u2212 xi xj ) for some \u03b3 > 0, but one can check that\ntheir proof works without modification when \u03b3 = 0. We finally obtain (a(x, Pt )y, y) \u2265 \u03bb1 cE0 ,H0 |y|2\nfor all t \u2265 0, x, y \u2208 Rd , which concludes the proof.\n\u0003\n4. On soft potentials\nWe consider in this section the spatially homogeneous Landau equation for soft potentials, which\nwrites (1) with aij (z) = |z|\u03b3 (|z|2 \u03b4ij \u2212zi zj ) for some \u03b3 \u2208 [\u22123, 0), the Coulomb case \u03b3 = \u22123 being the\nP\nmost interesting from a physical point of view. Then we have bi (z) = d1 \u2202j aij (z) = \u2212(d\u2212 1)|z|\u03b3 zi .\n\nSimulation with cutoff. We restrict our study to the case where \u03b3 \u2208 (\u22122,\nR 0]. We assume that P0\nhas finite moments of all orders, and has a density with a finite entropy P0 (x) log P0 (x)dx < \u221e.\nFor \u03b5 > 0 let \u03ba\u03b5 : R+ 7\u2192 R+ of class C 2 , nondecreasing, with \u03ba\u03b5 (z) = z for z \u2265 \u03b5, \u03ba\u03b5 (z) = \u03b5/2 for\nz \u2208 [0, \u03b5/2], with |\u03ba\u2032\u03b5 (z)| + \u03b5|\u03ba\u2032\u2032\u03b5 (z)| \u2264 C. Consider then a\u03b5 , b\u03b5 be defined as a, b with |z|\u03b3 replaced\nby [\u03ba\u03b5 (|z|)]\u03b3 . Then a\u03b5 is of class C 2 , with all its derivatives of order 2 bounded by C\u03b5\u03b3 , and b\u03b5 is\nLipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant C\u03b5\u03b3 .\nWe thus may apply Corollary 5 and Theorem 6. Denote by (Pt\u03b5 )t\u22650 = (L(Xt1,\u03b5 ))t\u22650 a weak\nsolution to (1) with a\u03b5 and P0\u03b5 = P0 . Then we believe that our results, plus some moment and\nellipticity estimates (uniform in \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1]), will give something like E[sup[0,T ] |Xt1,n,N,\u03b5 \u2212 Xt1,\u03b5 |2 ] \u2264\n(n\u22121 + N \u22121 ) exp(CT \u03b52\u03b3 ), where (Xti,n,N,\u03b5 )t\u22650,i=1,..,n solves (8) with a\u03b5 , b\u03b5 instead of a, b.\n\n\f10\n\nNICOLAS FOURNIER\n\nOn the other hand, we may apply the techniques introduced in [5] to estimate W22 (Pt , Pt\u03b5 ), where\n(Pt )t\u22650 = (L(Xt1 ))t\u22650 is a weak solution to (1) with a and P0 . We believe that, with a convenient\ncoupling, it is possible to obtain something like sup[0,T ] E[|Xt1,\u03b5 \u2212 Xt1 |2 ] \u2264 CT \u03b52 .\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n2\u03b3\nOne would thus get sup[0,T ] E[|Xt1,n,N,\u03b5 \u2212Xt1 |2 ] \u2264 CT \u03b52 + n\u22121 + N \u22121 eCT \u03b5 . This is of course\nan awfull rate of convergence. It does not seem reasonnable to handle a rigorous proof.\nSimulation without cutoff. However, the particle system\nand simulable\nP(8) is still well-defined\nP\nfor soft potentials (with \u03b3 \u2208 [\u22123, 0]), at least if we replace n1 k \u03b4X k,n,N by n1 k6=i \u03b4X k,n,N and if P0\nt\nt\nhas a density. Based on the well-posedness result of [5], we hope that, at least when \u03b3 \u2208 (\u22122, 0], one\nmight obtain the same estimates as in Corollary 5 and Theorem 6 ( under additionnal conditions\non P0 ). The proof however seems to be quite difficult: we do not know how to get a sufficiently\ngood estimate of quantities like |Xti,n,N \u2212 Xtj,n,N |\u03b3 .\n5. Numerics\nP\nLet us first observe that for the Landau equation 1 where a is given by (2) and bi = j \u2202j aij , the\nsimulable particle system (8) is conservative, in the sense that it preserves, in mean, momentum and\nR\nkinetic energy: for all i = 1, . . . , n, all t \u2265 0, E[Xti,n,N ] = xP0 (dx) and E[|Xti,n,N |2 ] = m2 (P0 ).\n\nWe consider here the Landau equation for soft potentials, for some \u03b3 \u2208 [\u22123, 0], described in the\nprevious section, in dimension d = 2. We use no cutoff procedure in the case \u03b3 < 0. We consider\nthe initial condition P0 with density P0 (x1 , x2 ) = f (x1 )g(x2 ), where f is the Gaussian density with\nmean 0 and variance 0.1, while g(x) = (f (x \u2212 1) + f (x + 1))/2. The momentum and energy of P0\nare given by (0, 0) and 1.02.\nThus in large time, the solution Pt should converge to the Gaussian distribution with mean (0, 0)\nand covariance matrix 0.51I2 , see Villani [12].\nWe use the particle system (8) with n particles, and N steps per unit of time. Easy considerations\nshow that the computation of (8) until time T is essentially proportionnal to T N n2 , and should not\ndepend too much on \u03b3. However, it is consequently faster when \u03b3 = 0 for obvious computational\n1\nreasons. Let us also remark that the law of (8) does not change when replacing a 2 by any \u03c3 such\nthat \u03c3(x, \u03bc)\u03c3(x, \u03bc)\u2217 = a(x, \u03bc). We thus use a Cholesky decomposition, which is numerically quite\nfast. Let us give an idea of the time needed to perform one time-step: with \u03b3 = 0, it takes around\n7.10\u22123 seconds (n = 500), 0.15 s (n = 2500), 3.5 s (n = 12500), and 13 s (n = 25000). The\ncomputations are around 10 times slower when \u03b3 < 0.\nNow we alway use n = 5000 particles, and N = 200 steps per unit of time. We draw, for different\nvalues of t and \u03b3, the histogram (with 80 sticks) based on the second coordinates of (Xti,n,N )i=1,...,n .\nThe plain curve is the expected asymptotic Gaussian density, with mean 0 and variance 0.51. The\nconvergence to equilibrium seems to be slower and slower as \u03b3 is more and more negative.\ngamma=0, t=0.5\n\ngamma=0, t=0.25\n\ngamma=0, t=1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\fPARTICLE APPROXIMATION OF SOME LANDAU EQUATIONS\n\ngamma=\u22121, t=0.25\n\ngamma=\u22121, t=1\n\ngamma=\u22121, t=2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\ngamma=\u22122.2, t=0.25\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\ngamma=\u22122.2, t=3\n\n1.0\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\ngamma=\u22122.2, t=1\n\n1.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n11\n\n0.0\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFor too small values of \u03b3 (say \u03b3 < \u22122.5), the numerical results are not so convincing.
