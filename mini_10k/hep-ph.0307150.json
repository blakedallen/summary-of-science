INTRODUCTION\n\nGeneralized Parton Distributions (GPDs) [1] parametrize the non-perturbative hadron\nstructure in hard exclusive processes (for comprehensive reviews, see, e.g., [2\u20137]). The\nmeasurement of GPDs would provide information which is usually encoded in both the\nelastic form factors and the usual Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and, at the same\ntime, it would represent a unique way to access several crucial features of the structure\nof the nucleon [8,9]. By measuring GPDs, a test of the Angular Momentum Sum Rule of\nthe proton [10] could be achieved for the first time, determining the quark orbital angular\nmomentum contribution to the proton spin [9,11].\nBesides, the possibility of obtaining, by means of GPDs measurements, information on\nthe structure of the proton in the impact parameter [12,13] and position [14\u201316] spaces, is\nbeing presently discussed.\nTherefore, relevant experimental efforts to measure GPDs, by means of exclusive electron\nDeep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) off the proton, are likely to take place in the next few years\n[17\u201319].\nIn this scenario, it becomes urgent to produce theoretical predictions for the behavior\nof these quantities. Several calculations have been already performed by using different\ndescriptions of hadron structure: bag models [20,21], soliton models [4,22], light-front [23]\nand Bethe Salpeter approaches [24], phenomenological estimates based on parametrizations\nof PDFs [25,26]. Besides, an impressive effort has been devoted to study the perturbative\nQCD evolution [27,28] of GPDs, and the GPDs at twist three accuracy [29].\nRecently, calculations have been performed also in Constituent Quark Models (CQM)\n[30,31]. The CQM has a long story of successful predictions in low energy studies of the\nelectromagnetic structure of the nucleon. In the high energy sector, in order to compare\nmodel predictions with data taken in DIS experiments, one has to evolve, according to\nperturbative QCD, the leading twist component of the physical structure functions obtained\nat the low momentum scale associated with the model, the so called \"hadronic scale\", \u03bc20 .\n3\n\n\fSuch a procedure, already addressed in [32,33], has proven successful in describing the\ngross features of standard PDFs by using different CQM (see, e.g., [34]). Similar expectations\nmotivated the study of GPDs in Ref. [30]. In that paper, a simple formalism has been\nproposed to calculate the quark contribution to GPDs from any non relativistic or relativized\nmodel and, as an illustration, results obtained in the Isgur and Karl model [35] have been\nevolved from \u03bc20 up to DIS scales, to NLO accuracy. In Ref. [31] the same quark contribution\nto GPDs has been evaluated, at \u03bc20 , using the overlap representation of GPDs [6] in lightfront dynamics, along the lines developed in [36].\nIn here, the procedure of Ref. [30] is extended and generalized. As a matter of fact,\nthe approach of Ref. [30], when applied in the standard forward case, has been proven to\nreproduce the gross features of PDFs [34] but, in order to achieve a better agreement with\ndata, it has to be improved. In a series of papers, it has been shown that unpolarized [37]\nand polarized [38] DIS data are consistent with a low energy scenario, dominated by complex constituent quarks inside the nucleon, defined through a scheme suggested by Altarelli,\nCabibbo, Maiani and Petronzio (ACMP) [39], updated with modern phenomenological information. The same idea has been recently applied to demonstrate the evidence of complex\nobjects inside the nucleon [40], analyzing intermediate energy data of electron scattering off\nthe proton. Besides, a similar scenario has been extensively used by other groups, starting form the concept of \"valon\", introduced more than twenty years ago [41] (for recent\ndevelopments, see [42]).\nWe here generalize our description of the forward case [37] to the calculation scheme of\nRef. [30], in order to obtain more realistic predictions for the GPDs and, at the same time,\nexplore kinematical regions not accessible before.\nIn particular, the evaluation of the sea quark contribution becomes possible, so that\nGPDs could be calculated, in principle, in their full range of definition. Such an achievement would permit to estimate the cross-sections which are relevant for actual GPDs measurements, providing us with an important tool for planning future experiments. Actually,\nas it will be shown, the proposed approach will be applied here in a Non Relativistic (NR)\n4\n\n\fframework, which allows one to evaluate the GPDs only for small values of the 4-momentum\n~ 2 \u226a m2 , where m is the constituent quark mass) and small\ntransfer, \u22062 (corresponding to \u2206\nvalues also for the skewedness parameter, \u03be. The full kinematical range of definition of GPDs\nwill be studied in a followup, introducing relativity in the scheme.\nThe paper is structured as follows. After the definition of the main quantities of interest,\nan Impulse Approximation (IA) convolution formula for the current quark GPDs in terms\nof the constituent quark off-diagonal momentum distributions and constituent quark GPDs\nis derived in the third section. Then, the constituent quark GPDs are built in the fourth\nsection, according to ACMP philosophy and using the Double Distribution (DD's) representation [3,26,43] of the GPDs. In the fifth section, as an illustration, results obtained by\nusing CQM wave functions of the IK model and the obtained constituent quark GPDs will\nbe shown. Conclusions will be drawn in the last section.\n\nII. QUARK MODEL CALCULATIONS OF GPDS\n\nWe are interested in hard exclusive processes. The absorption of a high-energy virtual\nphoton by a quark in a hadron target is followed by the emission of a particle to be later\ndetected; finally, the interacting quark is reabsorbed back into the recoiling hadron. If the\nemitted and detected particle is, for example, a real photon, the so called Deeply Virtual\nCompton Scattering process takes place [8,9,11]. We adopt here the formalism used in Ref.\n[2]. Let us think to a nucleon target, with initial (final) momentum and helicity P (P \u2032)\nand s(s\u2032 ), respectively. The GPDs Hq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) and Eq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) are defined through the\nexpression\nFsq\u2032 s (x, \u03be, \u22062 )\n\n1\n=\n2\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\u03bbn\n\u03bbn\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx \u2032 \u2032\nn\n/ \u03c8q\n|P si =\ne hP s | \u03c8\u0304q \u2212\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\n1\ni\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc \u2206\u03bd\n1\n/U(P, s) + Eq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) \u016a(P \u2032 , s\u2032 )\nU(P, s) , (1)\n= Hq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) \u016a (P \u2032 , s\u2032 )n\n2\n2\n2M\nZ\n\nwhere \u2206 = P \u2032 \u2212 P is the 4-momentum transfer to the nucleon, \u03c8q is the quark field and M\n5\n\n\fis the nucleon mass. It is convenient to work in a system of coordinates where the photon\n4-momentum, q \u03bc = (q0 , ~q), and P\u0304 = (P + P \u2032 )/2 are collinear along z. The \u03be variable in\nthe arguments of the GPDs is the so called \"skewedness\", parametrizing the asymmetry\nof the process. It is defined by the relation \u03be = \u2212n * \u2206/2, where n is a light-like 4-vector\nsatisfying the condition n * P\u0304 = 1. As explained in [9,11], GPDs describe the amplitude for\nfinding a quark with momentum fraction\n\nx + \u03be (in the Infinite Momentum Frame) in a\n\nnucleon with momentum (1 + \u03be)P\u0304 and replacing it back into the nucleon with a momentum\ntransfer \u2206. Besides, when the quark longitudinal momentum fraction x of the average\nnucleon momentum P\u0304 is less than \u2212\u03be, GPDs describe antiquarks; when it is larger than \u03be,\nthey describe quarks; when it is between \u2212\u03be and \u03be, they describe q q\u0304 pairs.

(8) in [30], permits the calculation of Hq (x, \u03be, \u22062)\nin any CQM, and it naturally verifies some of the properties of GPDs. In fact, the unpolarized quark density, q(x), as obtained by analyzing, in IA, DIS off the nucleon (see, e.g.,\n[45]), assuming that the interacting quark is on-shell, is recovered in the forward limit, where\n\u22062 = \u03be = 0:\nq(x) = Hq (x, 0, 0) =\n\nZ\n\nk+\nd~k nq (~k) \u03b4 x \u2212 +\nP\u0304\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nso that the constraint Eq.

In the above equation, nq (~k) is the momentum\ndistribution of the quarks in the nucleon:\nnq (~k) =\n\nZ\n\n~\n\n\u2032\n\neik*(~r\u2212~r ) \u03c1q (~r, ~r\u2032 )d~rd~r\u2032 .\n\n(24)\n\nBesides, integrating Eq. (22) over x, one obtains\nZ\n\n2\n\ndxHq (x, \u03be, \u2206 ) =\n\nZ\n\n~\n\nd~rei\u2206*~r \u03c1q (~r) ,\n\nwhere \u03c1q (~r) = lim~r\u2032 \u2192~r \u03c1q (~r\u2032 , ~r) is the contribution of the quark q to the charge density. The\nr.h.s. of the above equation gives the IA definition of the charge f.f.\nZ\n\n~\n\nd~rei\u2206*~r \u03c1q (~r) = F q (\u22062 ) ,\n\n(25)\n\nso that, recalling that F q (\u22062 ) coincides with the non relativistic limit of the Dirac f.f.\nF1q (\u22062 ), Eq. (4) is verified.\nBesides, the polynomiality condition is formally fulfilled by the GPD defined in Eq. (22),\nalthough the present accuracy of the model, explicitly written in the latter equation, does\nnot allow to really check polynomiality, due to the already mentioned effects of the Munich\nSymmetry [44].\nThe definition of Hq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) in terms of CQM wave functions can be generalized to\nother GPDs, and the relation of the latter quantities with other form factors (for example the\n10\n\n\fmagnetic one) and other PDFs (for example the polarized quark density) can be recovered.\nTherefore the proposed scheme allows one to calculate the GPDs by using any CQM.\nWith respect to Eq. (22), a few caveats are necessary.\ni) One should keep in mind that Eq. (22) is a NR result, holding for \u03be 2 \u226a 1, under the\n~ 2 \u226a m2 . If one wants to treat more general processes, the NR limit\nconditions ~k 2 \u226a m2 , \u2206\nshould be relaxed by taking into account relativistic corrections. In this way, at the same\ntime, an expression to evaluate Eq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) could be obtained. Since our main aim here is\nto describe our approach, rather than to obtain realistic estimates, we postpone to a later\npublication the discussion of a relativistic model, which will permit to study the full \u22062 and \u03be-range, together with the GPD Eq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ).\nii) The Constituent Quarks are assumed to be point-like.\niii) If use is made of a CQM, containing only constituent quarks (and also antiquarks\nin the case of mesons), only the quark (and antiquark) contribution to the GPDs can be\nevaluated, i.e., only the region x \u2265 \u03be (and also x \u2264 \u2212\u03be for mesons) can be explored. In\norder to introduce the study of the ERBL region (\u2212\u03be \u2264 x \u2264 \u03be), so that observables like\ncross-sections, spin asymmetries and so on can be calculated, the model has to be enriched.\niv) In actual calculations, the evaluation of Eq. (22) requires the choice of a reference\n~ 2 and,\nframe. In the following, the Breit Frame will be chosen, where one has \u22062 = \u2212\u2206\n\u221a\nin the NR limit we are studying, one finds 2P\u0304 + \u2192 M. It happens therefore that, in the\nargument of the \u03b4 function in Eq. (22), the x variable for the valence quarks is not defined\nin its natural support, i.e. it can be larger than 1 and smaller than \u03be. Several prescriptions\nhave been proposed in the past to overcome such a difficulty in the standard PDFs case\n[33,34]. Although the support violation is small for the calculations that will be shown here,\nit has to be reported as a drawback of the approach.\nThe issue iii) will be discussed in the next sections, by relaxing the condition ii) and\nallowing for a finite size and composite structure of the constituent quark.\n\n11\n\n\fIII. GPDS IN A CONSTITUENT QUARK SCENARIO\n\nThe procedure described in the previous section, when applied in the standard forward\ncase, has been proven to be able to reproduce the gross features of PDFs [34]. In order to\nachieve a better agreement with data, the approach has to be improved.\nIn a series of previous papers, it has been shown that unpolarized [37] and polarized [38]\nDIS data are consistent with a low energy scenario dominated by composite constituents\nof the nucleon. This was obtained using a simple picture of the constituent quark as a\ncomplex system of point-like partons, and thus constructing the forward parton distributions\nby a convolution between constituent quark momentum distributions and constituent quark\nstructure functions. The latter quantities were obtained by using updated phenomenological\ninformation in a scenario firstly suggested by Altarelli, Cabibbo, Maiani and Petronzio\n(ACMP) already in the seventies [39].\nFollowing the same idea, in this section a model for the reaction mechanism of an offforward process, such as DVCS, where GPDs could be measured, will be proposed. As a\nresult, a convolution formula giving the proton Hq GPD in terms of a constituent quark\noff-forward momentum distribution, Hq0 , and of a GPD of the constituent quark q0 itself,\nHq0 q , will be derived.\nIt is assumed that the hard scattering with the virtual photon takes place on a parton of\na spin 1/2 target, made of complex constituents. This can be the case of a spin 1/2 nucleus,\nsuch as 3 He, or of the proton, if this is assumed to be made of composite constituent quarks.\nThe latter situation is the one we are interested in.\nThe scenario we are thinking of is depicted in Fig. 1 for the special case of DVCS, in\nthe handbag approximation. One parton (current quark) with momentum k, belonging to a\ngiven constituent of momentum p, interacts with the probe and it is afterwards reabsorbed,\nwith momentum k + \u2206, by the same constituent, without further re-scattering with the\nrecoiling system of momentum PR . We suggest here an analysis of the process which is quite\nsimilar to the usual IA approach to DIS off nuclei [45\u201347].\n12\n\n\fIn the class of frames chosen in section 2, and in addition to the kinematical variables, x\nand \u03be, already defined, one needs a few more to describe the process. In particular, x\u2032 and\n\u03be \u2032 , for the \"internal\" target, i.e., the constituent quark, have to be introduced. The latter\nquantities can be obtained defining the \"+\" components of the momentum k and k + \u2206 of\nthe struck parton before and after the interaction, with respect to P\u0304 + and p\u0304+ = 12 (p + p\u2032 )+ :\nk + = (x + \u03be)P\u0304 + = (x\u2032 + \u03be \u2032)p\u0304+ ,\n\n(26)\n\n(k + \u2206)+ = (x \u2212 \u03be)P\u0304 + = (x\u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032 )p\u0304+ .\n\n(27)\n\nFrom the above expressions, \u03be \u2032 and x\u2032 are immediately obtained as\n\u2206+\n\u03be =\u2212 +\n2p\u0304\n\u2032\n\u03be\nx\u2032 = x\n\u03be\n\u2032\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\nand, since \u03be = \u2212\u2206+ /(2P\u0304 + ), if z\u0303 = p+ /P + , one also has\n\u03be\u2032 =\n\n\u03be\n.\nz\u0303(1 + \u03be) \u2212 \u03be\n\n(30)\n\nThese expressions have been already found and used in the IA analysis of DVCS off the\ndeuteron [48] and, in general, off nuclei [49].\nIn order to derive a convolution formula, a standard procedure will be adopted [45\u201347].\nIn Eq.

One should notice that the forward limit of Eq. (35) gives\nthe expression which is usually found, for the parton distribution q(x), in the IA analysis of\nunpolarized DIS off nuclei [45\u201347]. In fact, if in Eq. (35) the index q0 , labelling a constituent\nquark, is replaced by the index N, labelling a nucleon in the nucleus, in the forward limit\none finds the well known result:\nq(x) = Hq (x, 0, 0) =\n\nXZ\n\ndz\nx\nfN (z) qN\nz\nz\n\n,\n\n(37)\n\np+\nd~p nN (~p)\u03b4 z \u2212 +\nP\u0304\n\n!\n\n(38)\n\n1\n\nx\n\nN\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\nwhere\nfN (z) = HN (z, 0, 0) =\n\nZ\n\nis the light-cone momentum distribution of the nucleon N in the nucleus and qN (x) =\nHN q (x, 0, 0) is the distribution of the quark of flavor q in the nucleon N.\n\nIV. A MODEL FOR THE GPDS OF THE CONSTITUENT QUARK\n\nThe crucial problem now is the definition of Hq0 q ( xz , z\u03be , \u22062 ), the constituent quark GPD,\nappearing in Eq. (35).\nAs usual, we can start modelling this quantity thinking first of all to its forward limit,\nwhere the constituent quark parton distributions have to be recovered. As we said in the\nprevious section, in a series of papers [37,38] a simple picture of the constituent quark as a\ncomplex system of point-like partons has been proposed, re-taking a scenario suggested by\nAltarelli, Cabibbo, Maiani and Petronzio (ACMP) [39].\nLet us recall the main features of that idea.\nThe constituent quarks are themselves composite objects whose structure functions are\ndescribed by a set of functions \u03c6q0 q (x) that specify the number of point-like partons of type\nq which are present in the constituent of type q0 , with fraction x of its total momentum.\nWe will hereafter call these functions, generically, the structure functions of the constituent\nquark.\n15\n\n\fThe functions describing the nucleon parton distributions are expressed in terms of the\nindependent \u03c6q0 q (x) and of the constituent density distributions (q0 = u0 , d0 ) as,\n2\n\nq(x, Q ) =\n\nXZ\nq0\n\n1\n\nx\n\nx 2\ndz\nq0 (z, Q2 )\u03c6q0q\n,Q\nz\nz\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere q labels the various partons, i.e., valence quarks (uv , dv ), sea quarks (us , ds , s), sea\n \u0304 s\u0304) and gluons g.\nantiquarks (\u016b, d,\nThe different types and functional forms of the structure functions of the constituent\nquarks are derived from three very natural assumptions [39]:\ni) The point-like partons are QCD degrees of freedom, i.e. quarks, antiquarks and gluons;\nii) Regge behavior for x \u2192 0 and duality ideas;\niii) invariance under charge conjugation and isospin.\nThese considerations define in the case of the valence quarks the following structure\nfunction\n\u0393(A + 12 ) (1 \u2212 x)A\u22121\n\u221a\n\u03c6qqv (x, Q ) = 1\n.\nx\n\u0393( 2 )\u0393(A)\n2\n\n(40)\n\nFor the sea quarks the corresponding structure function becomes,\n\u03c6qqs (x, Q2 ) =\n\nC\n(1 \u2212 x)D\u22121 ,\nx\n\n(41)\n\nG\n(1 \u2212 x)B\u22121 .\nx\n\n(42)\n\nand, in the case of the gluons, it is taken\n\u03c6qg (x, Q2 ) =\n\nThe last assumption of the approach relates to the scale at which the constituent quark\nstructure is defined. We choose for it the so called hadronic scale \u03bc20 [34,50]. This hypothesis\nfixes all the parameters of the approach (Eqs. (40) through (42)). The constants A, B, G and\nthe ratio C/D are determined by the amount of momentum carried by the different partons,\ncorresponding to a hadronic scale of \u03bc20 = 0.34 GeV2 , according to the parametrization of\n16\n\n\f[50]. C (or D) is fixed according to the value of F2 at x = 0.01 [39], and its value is chosen\nagain according to [50]. We stress that all these inputs are forced only by the updated\nphenomenology, through the 2nd moments of PDFs. The values of the parameters obtained\nare listed in [37].\nWe, here, note that the unpolarized structure function F2 is rather insensitive to the\nchange of the sea (C, D) and gluon (B, G) parameters.\nThe other ingredients appearing in Eq. (39), i.e., the density distributions for each\nconstituent quark, are defined according to Eq. (22).\nNow we have to generalize this scenario to describe off-forward phenomena. Of course,\nthe forward limit of our GPDs formula, Eq. (35), has to be given by Eq. (39). By taking\nthe forward limit of Eq. (35), one obtains:\nHq (x, 0, 0) =\n\nXZ\nq0\n\n=\n\nXZ\nq0\n\n1\nx\n1\nx\n\ndz\nx\nHq0 (z, 0, 0)Hq0 q\n, 0, 0\nz\nz\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx\ndz\nq0 (z)Hq0 q\n, 0, 0 ,\nz\nz\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(43)\n\nso that, in order for the latter to coincide with Eq. (39), one must have Hq0 q (x, 0, 0) \u2261\n\u03c6q0 q (x).\nIn such a way, through the ACMP prescription, the forward limit of the unknown constituent quark GPD Hq0 q ( xz , z\u03be , \u22062 ) can be fixed.\nNow the off-forward behavior of the Constituent Quark GPDs has to be modelled.\nThis can be done in a natural way by using the \"\u03b1-Double Distributions\" (DD's) language\nproposed by Radyushkin [3,43]. DD's, \u03a6(x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062), are a representation of GPDs which\nautomatically guarantees the polynomiality property. GPDs can be obtained from DD's after\na proper integration. In constructing models, the DD's can represent a more appropriate\nlanguage with respect to GPDs. In fact, the hybrid character of GPDs, which are something\nin between parton densities q(x) and distribution amplitudes \u03c6(\u03b1), is naturally emphasized\nwhen the latter are obtained from DD's. The DD's do not depend on the skewedness\nparameter \u03be; rather, they describe how the total, P , and transfer, \u2206, momenta are shared\nbetween the interacting and final partons, by means of the variables x\u0303 and \u03b1, respectively.\n17\n\n\fAs it can be argued from Fig. 2, where the DDs representation of GPDs is illustrated\nschematically, and as it is explained in [3,43], parton densities are recovered in the forward,\n\u2206 = 0 limit, while meson distribution amplitudes are obtained in the P = 0 limit of\nDD's. In some cases, such a transparent physical interpretation, together with the symmetry\nproperties which are typical of distribution amplitudes (\u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u03b1 symmetry), allows a direct\nmodelling, already developed in [26].\nThe relation between any GPD H, defined \u00e0 la Ji, for example the one we need, i.e. Hq0 q\nfor the constituent quark target, is related to the \u03b1-DD's, which we call \u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 ) for\nthe constituent quark, in the following way [3,43]:\nHq0q (x, \u03be, \u22062) =\n\n1\n\nZ\n\n\u22121\n\ndx\u0303\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212|x\u0303|\n\u22121+|x\u0303|\n\n\u03b4(x\u0303 + \u03be\u03b1 \u2212 x)\u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 )d\u03b1 .\n\n(44)\n\nWith some care, the expression above can be integrated over x\u0303 and the result is explicitly\ngiven in [3]. The DDs fulfill the relation:\n\u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 ) = \u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u2212\u03b1, \u22062 ) ,\n\n(45)\n\nand the polynomiality condition [2].\nIn [43], a factorized ansatz is suggested for the DD's:\n\u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 ) = hq (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062)\u03a6q0 q (x\u0303)Fq0 (\u22062 ) ,\n\n(46)\n\nwith the \u03b1 dependent term, hq (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 ), which has the character of a mesonic amplitude,\nfulfilling the relation:\nZ\n\n1\u2212|x\u0303|\n\n\u22121+|x\u0303|\n\nhq (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 )d\u03b1 = 1 .\n\n(47)\n\nBesides, in Eq. (46) \u03a6q0 q (x\u0303) represents the forward density and, eventually, Fq0 (\u22062 ) the\nconstituent quark form factor.\nOne immediately realizes that the GPD of the constituent quark, Eq. (44), with the\nfactorized form Eq. (46) and the normalization Eq. (47), fulfills the crucial constraints of\nGPDs, i.e., the forward limit, the first-moment and the polynomiality condition, the latter\nbeing automatically verified in the DD's description.\n18\n\n\fIn the following, we will assume for the constituent quark GPD the above factorized\nform, so that we need to model the three functions appearing in Eq. (46), according to the\ndescription of the reaction mechanism we have in mind.\nFor the amplitude hq , use will be made of one of the simple normalized forms suggested\nin [43], on the bases of the symmetry properties of DD's:\nh(1)\nq (x\u0303, \u03b1) =\n\n3 (1 \u2212 x\u0303)2 \u2212 \u03b12\n.\n4 (1 \u2212 x\u0303)3\n\n(48)\n\nBesides, since we will identify quarks for x \u2265 \u03be/2, pairs for x \u2264 |\u03be/2|, antiquarks for\nx \u2264 \u2212\u03be/2, and, since in our approach the forward densities \u03a6q0 q (x\u0303) have to be given by the\nstandard \u03a6 functions of the ACMP approach, Eqs. (40)\u2013(42), one has, for the DD of flavor\nq of the constituent quark:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (hq (x\u0303, \u03b1)\u03a6q0 qv (x\u0303) + hq (x\u0303, \u03b1)\u03a6q0 qs (x\u0303))Fq0 (\u22062 )\n\n\u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 ) =\n\n\u2212hq (\u2212x\u0303, \u03b1)\u03a6q0 qs (\u2212x\u0303)Fq0 (\u22062 )\n\n\uf8f3\n\nfor x\u0303 \u2265 0\n\n(49)\n\nfor x\u0303 < 0\n\nThe above definition, due to Eq. (47), when integrated over \u03b1 gives the correct limits\n[3]:\nZ\n\n1\u2212x\u0303\n\n\u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 = 0)|x\u0303>0 d\u03b1 = \u03a6q0 q (x\u0303) ,\n\n(50)\n\n\u03a6\u0303q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 = 0)|x\u0303<0 d\u03b1 = \u2212\u03a6q0 q\u0304 (\u2212x\u0303) .\n\n(51)\n\n\u22121+x\u0303\n\nand\nZ\n\n1\u2212|x\u0303|\n\n\u22121+|x\u0303|\n\nEventually, as a f.f. we will take a monopole form corresponding to a constituent quark\nsize rQ \u2243 0.3f m:\nFq0 (\u22062 ) =\n\n1\n1\u2212\n\n2\n\u22062 rQ\n6\n\n,\n\n(52)\n\na scenario strongly supported by the analysis of [40].\nBy using such a f.f. and Eq. (48), together with the standard ACMP \u03a6's, Eqs. (40) and\n(41), in Eq. (49), and inserting the obtained \u03a6q0 q (x\u0303, \u03b1, \u22062 ) into Eq. (44), the constituent\nquark GPD in the ACMP scenario can be eventually calculated.\n19\n\n\fV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we present the results obtained for the GPD Hq of the proton, for \u03be 2 \u226a 1\n~ 2 \u226a m2 , according to the approach described so far.

This means that it is obtained\nevaluating Eq.

Here we have\n\nused the notation k 2 = ~k 2 , ~k = (kx , ky , kz ).\n\n21\n\n\fThe harmonic oscillator parameter, \u03b1, of the IK model, can be chosen so that the experimental r.m.s. of the proton is reproduced by the slope, at \u22062 = 0, of the charge form\nfactor. Such a choice is performed as follows. Integrating Eq. (35) over x, one gets:\nFq (\u22062 ) =\n\nX\n\nFq0 (\u22062 )Fq0 q (\u22062 ) ,\n\n(61)\n\nq0\n\nwhere Fq (\u22062 ) is the contribution, of the current quark of flavor q, to the proton f.f.; Fq0 (\u22062 )\nis the contribution, of the point-like constituent quark of flavor q0 , to the proton f.f.; Fq0 q (\u22062 )\nis the contribution, of the current quark of flavor q, to the f.f. of the composite constituent\nquark of flavor q0 .\nThe latter is given by Eq. (52), while in the IK model one has [51]:\n!\n\n\u22062\na\nb\nFq0 (\u22062 ) = 1 \u2212 \u22062 \u2212 2 \u22064 e 6\u03b12 ,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(62)\n\nwith a \u2243 0.015 and b \u2243 0.0001. Imposing that the slope of the f.f., Eq.(61), reproduces at\n\u22062 = 0 the experimental proton r.m.s., a value of \u03b1 = 1.18f \u22121 is obtained. Such a form\nfactor reproduces well the data at the low values of \u22062 which are accessible in the present\napproach. For higher values of \u22062 , it would not be realistic [51].\nResults for the u-quark H distribution, at the scale of the model \u03bc2o , are shown in Figs\n3 to 5. In Fig. 3, it is shown for \u22062 = \u22120.1 GeV2 and \u03be = 0.1. One should remember that\nthe present approach does not allow to estimate realistically the region \u2212\u22062 \u2265 m2 \u2243 0.1\nGeV2 , so that we are showing here the result corresponding to the highest possible \u22062\nvalue. Accordingly, the maximum value of the skewedness is therefore \u03be \u2243 0.17 (cf. Eq.\n(2)), fulfilling the requirement \u03be 2 \u226a 1. The dashed curve represents what is obtained in\nthe pure Isgur and Karl model, i.e., by evaluating Eq. (54). One should notice that such a\nresult, obtained in a pure valence CQM, should vanish for x \u2264 \u03be and for x \u2265 1. The small\ntails which are found in these forbidden regions represent the amount of support violation\nof the approach. In particular, for the shown values of \u22062 and \u03be, a violation of 2 % is found.\nIn general, in the accessible region the violation is never larger than few percents. The full\ncurve in Fig. 3 represents the complete result of the present approach, i.e., the evaluation\n22\n\n\fof Eq. (35) following the steps and using the ingredients described in this section and in the\nprevious one. A relevant contribution is found to lie in the ERBL region, in agreement with\nother estimates [4]. As already explained, the knowledge of GPDs in the ERBL region is a\ncrucial prerequisite for the calculation of all the cross-sections and the observables measured\nin the processes where GPDs contribute. We notice that the ERBL region is accessed\nhere, with respect to the approach of Ref. [30] which gives the dashed curve, thanks to the\nconstituent structure which has been introduced by the ACMP procedure.\nIn Fig. 4, special emphasis is devoted to show the \u03be-dependence of the results. For the\nallowed \u03be values, Hu (x, \u03be, \u22062 ), evaluated using our main formula, Eq. (35), is shown for four\ndifferent values of x. It is clearly seen that such a dependence is strong in the ERBL region,\nwhile it is rather mild in the DGLAP region, in good agreement with other estimates [4]. To\nallow for a complete view of the outcome of our approach, in Fig. 5 the x and \u03be dependences\nare shown together in a 3-dimensional plot.\nThe results shown so far are associated with the low scale of the model, the hadronic\nscale \u03bc20 , fixed to the value 0.34 GeV2 , as discussed in Section 4. As an illustration, in\nFig. 6 and 7 the Next to Leading Order QCD-evolution of the Non Singlet (NS), valence\nu distribution, up to a scale of Q2 = 10 GeV2 , is shown. One should notice that any NS\ndistribution is symmetric in x, due to its definition and in agreement with the conventions\nused:\nHqN S (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) = Hq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) \u2212 Hq\u0304 (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) =\n= Hq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) + Hq (\u2212x, \u03be, \u22062 ) .\n\n(63)\n\nIn evolving the model results, the approach of Ref. [28] has been applied and a code kindly\nprovided by A. Freund has been used. The evolution clearly shows a strong enhancement of\nthe ERBL region.\nWe have therefore developed a scheme which provides us with the GPD H in the full\nx range. This is obtained thanks to the constituent quark structure, implemented dressing\nthe three quarks of a CQM, where initially only the DGLAP region of GPDs was accessible.\n23\n\n\fThis is an important development with respect to previous work, a prerequisite for any\nattempt to calculate cross sections and asymmetries of related processes. The next step of\nour studies will be indeed to use the obtained GPDs for the evaluation of cross sections which\nhave been recently measured [52,53] or will be measured soon. The estimate of cross sections\nis presently in progress, together with that of relativistic corrections, which will permit to\nenlarge the kinematical range (basically the \u22062 and the related \u03be-ranges) where our results\ncan be applied to predict or to describe the data. For the time being, the comparison with\ndata of our estimates is therefore not possible.\nAnyway, as already said, the present approach fulfills several theoretical constraints. First\nof all, the forward limit, Eq. (39), provides us with a reasonable description of quark densities\n(see Ref. [37], where the IK model together with the ACMP mechanism has been applied\nto unpolarized DIS 1 ). Secondly, the x\u2212integral of our GPD H turns out to be, formally\nand numerically, \u03be independent, satisfying therefore the polynomiality condition for the first\nmoment, and providing us with a proton form factor, Eq. (62), in good agreement with\nthe data in the low-\u22062 region which is studied here. The main theoretical drawback is the\nalready discussed support-violation, which in any case affects our findings, in the kinematical\nregion under investigation, by a few percents at most. Another theoretical constraint which\nis satisfied by the present approach is the inequality:\nHq (x, \u03be, \u22062 ) \u2264\n\nq\n\nq(x1 )q(x2 )/(1 \u2212 \u03be 2) ,\n\n(64)\n\nwhere x1 = (x + \u03be)/(1 + \u03be) and x2 = (x \u2212 \u03be)/(1 \u2212 \u03be), proven in [43]. As an illustration, the\nvalidity of the above inequality is shown in Fig. 8 for the u-flavor, and for \u22062 = \u22120.1 GeV2\nand \u03be = 0.1.\nOther theoretical constraints, such as the Ji sum rule [9], require the knowledge of the\nother unpolarized GPD, E, which has not yet been calculated in the present scheme. E arises\n\n1 In\n\nthat work [37], we showed that more sophisticated quark models were producing an excellent\n\ndescription of the data [54].\n\n24\n\n\fnaturally in a relativistic framework, where we plan to calculate it. In fact, a relativistic\ncalculation will permit us to overcome the support problem and, at the same time, to enlarge\nthe kinematical range of our predictions. Once a relativistic CQM is used to predict GPDs\nin the DGLAP region, the structure of the constituent quark can be introduced to access\nthe ERBL region, so that the Ji sum rule and other theoretical constraints can be checked.\nWork is being carried out in that direction.\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nQuark models have been extremely useful for understanding many features of hadrons,\neven in the DIS regime. In previous work, a thorough analysis of both polarized and unpolarized data have shown that constituent quarks cannot be considered elementary when studied\nwith high-energy probes. The first feature found was the need for evolution, i.e. the constituent quarks at the hadronic scale have to be undressed by incorporating bremsstrahlung\nin order to reach the Bjorken regime, but this was not all. A second feature, we found, was\nthat the constituent quarks should be endowed with soft structure in order to approach the\ndata. Thus, the constituent quarks appear, when under scrutiny by high-energy probes, as\ncomplex systems, with a very different behavior from the current quarks of the basic theory.\nThese features, which we found in structure functions, have also been recently discussed in\nform factors [40].\nThe aim of the present work has been to generalize the formalism of composite constituent\nquarks to study the generalized parton distributions. We here develop a formalism which\nexpresses the hadronic GPDs in terms of constituent quarks GPDs by means of appropriate\nconvolutions. In order to be able to predict experimental results we have defined a model\nwhich incorporates phenomenological features of various kinematical regimes. The model is\nbased on Radyushkin's factorization ansatz, thus our constituent quark GPDs are defined in\nterms of the product of three functions: i) the constituent quark structure function, where\nwe use the ACMP proposal [39]; ii) Radyushkin's double distributions [43]; iii) constituent\n25\n\n\fquark form factor as suggested in Ref. [40]. Once these GPDs are defined in this way,\nwe have developed the scheme to incorporate them into any nucleon model by appropriate\nconvolution. In order to show the type of predictions to which our proposal leads, we have\nused here, as an illustration, a naive model of hadron structure, namely the IK [35] model.\nHowever, in this latest step of our scheme, any non-relativistic (or relativized) model can be\nused to define the hadronic GPDs.\nLooking at our results, we found that the present scheme transforms a hadronic model,\nin whose original description only valence quarks appear, into one containing all kinds of\npartons (i.e., quarks, antiquarks and gluons). Moreover, the starting model produces no\nstructure in the ERBL region, while after the structure of the constituent quark has been\nincorporated, it does. The completeness of the x-range, for the allowed \u22062 and \u03be, of the\npresent description, is a prerequisite for the calculation of cross-sections and other observables in a wide kinematical range. To this respect we recall that our findings hold for\n\u22062 << m2 and \u03be 2 \u226a 1. Nevertheless, relativistic corrections, which permit to access a\nwider kinematical region, could be included in the approach. Our aim here has been mainly\nthe illustration of our scheme, and the inclusion of relativistic corrections, together with the\nuse of more sophisticated models, has been postponed and will be shown elsewhere.\nWe have reminded the reader of the calculation for the diagonal structure functions and\nform factors to see how in these cases, where experimental data are available, our scheme\nleads, even with a naive quark model, to a reasonable description of the data. Thereafter,\nwe have proceeded to calculate the GPDs of physical interest to guide the preparation and\nanalysis of future experiments.\nThis work is the continuation of an effort to construct a scheme which describes the\nproperties of hadrons in different kinematical and dynamical scenarios. Our description can\nnever be a substitute of Quantum Chromodynamics, but, before a solution of it can be\nfound, it may serve to guide experimenters to physical processes where the theory might\nshow interesting features, worthy of a more fundamental effort.\nThe approach here presented can be extended to light nuclei and fragmentation functions,\n26\n\n\fand work is being carried out also in these directions.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge useful correspondence with A.

Dashed curve: result in the pure Isgur and Karl model, Eq. (54). The\nsmall tails which are found in the forbidden regions, x \u2264 \u03be and x \u2265 1, represent the amount\nof support violation of the approach. Full curve: the complete result of the present approach,\nEq. (35).\nFig. 4: For the \u03be values which are allowed at \u22062 = \u22120.1 GeV2 , Hu (x, \u03be, \u22062 ), evaluated using\nour main equation, Eq. (35), is shown for four different values of x, at the momentum scale\nof the model. From top to bottom, the dash-dotted line represents the GPD at x = 0.05,\nthe full line at x = 0.1, the dashed line at x = 0.2, and the long-dashed line at x = 0.4.\nFig. 5: The x and \u03be dependences of Hu (x, \u03be, \u22062 ), for \u22062 = \u22120.1 GeV2 , at the momentum\nscale of the model.\nFig. 6: The Non Singlet (NS) H GPD for valence u-quarks at \u03be = 0.1 and \u22062 = \u22120.1\nGeV2 , at the momentum scale of the model, \u03bc20 = 0.34 GeV2 (dashed), and after NLO-QCD\nevolution up to Q2 = 10 GeV2 (full).\nFig. 7: The Non Singlet H GPD for valence u-quarks at \u03be = 0.1 and \u22062 = \u22120.1 GeV2 ,\nevolved at NLO from the momentum scale of the model, \u03bc20 = 0.34 GeV2 , up to Q2 = 10\nGeV2 .\nFig. 8: Full curve: the GPD Hu (x, \u03be, \u22062 ), for \u22062 = \u22120.1 GeV2 and \u03be = 0.1, at the\nmomentum scale of the model; dashed curve: the quantity\nx1 = (x + \u03be)/(1 + \u03be) and x2 = (x \u2212 \u03be)/(1 \u2212 \u03be) (see text).\n32\n\nq\n\nu(x1 )u(x2 )/(1 \u2212 \u03be 2 ), where\n\n\fe'\ne\n\n\u03b3\nq\u2212 \u2206\n\n\u03b3 \u2217, q\nk+ \u2206\n\nk\n\np'=p+ \u2206\n\np\n\nP'=P + \u2206\n\nP\nPR\nFIG. 1.\n\n_\n~\nxP \u2212(1+ \u03b1 ) \u2206 /2\n\n_\nP \u2212 \u2206 /2\n\n_\n(x + \u03be) P\n\n_\n~\nxP + (1\u2212 \u03b1 ) \u2206/2\n\n~ \u03b1, \u22062 )\n\u03c6 (x,\n\n_\nP + \u2206 /2\n\n_\n(1+ \u03be ) P\n\n(a)\n\n_\n(x \u2212 \u03be ) P\n\nH(x, \u03be , \u22062 )\n\n(b)\nFIG. 2.\n\n33\n\n_\n(1\u2212 \u03be ) P\n\n\f5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 3.\n\n34\n\n1\n\n\f6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\nFIG. 4.\n\n35\n\n0.15\n\n\fFIG. 5.\n\n36\n\n\f6\n4\n2\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 6.\n\nFIG. 7.\n\n37\n\n1\n\n\f4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nFIG. 8.\n\n38\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\f"}
