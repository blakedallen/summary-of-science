In the\nhole-doped high-Tc cuprates, it is well known that nonmagnetic impurities such as Zn tend to suppress the superconductivity more markedly than magnetic impurities\nsuch as Ni, [1] which is an opposite trend to the conventional superconductors. [2] Early NMR and NQR measurements have revealed that Zn acts as a strong scatterer of holes causing the unitarity scattering, while Ni\nacts as a weak scatterer causing the Born scattering. [3]\nFrom inelastic neutron-scattering experiments focusing\non the high-energy Cu-spin fluctuations, it has been\nreported that the so-called resonance energy does not\nchange through the Zn substitution, while it decreases\nthrough the Ni substitution. [4] As for the low-energy Cuspin fluctuations, on the other hand, Kimura et al. [5] and\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor: adachi@teion.apph.tohoku.ac.jp\naddress: Department of Physics, Faculty of Mathematics\nand Natural Sciences, Padjadjaran University, Jl.

[6] have insisted from the inelastic neutronscattering measurements in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4\nwith x = 0.15 that Zn tends to bring about the so-called\nin-gap state in the spin gap, while Ni tends to reduce\nthe spin gap itself. These results are strongly suggestive\nof different effects between the Zn and Ni substitution\non the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity, but the\nreason has not yet been clarified.\nFormerly, we have performed zero-field (ZF) muonspin-relaxation (\u03bcSR) and magnetic-susceptibility, \u03c7,\nmeasurements in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 around x =\n0.115 at low temperatures down to 2 K, changing y up\nto 0.10 in fine step, [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] in order to investigate impurity effects on the so-called spin-charge stripe\norder [13] which may be related to the mechanism of\nhigh-Tc superconductivity. [14] For the Zn substitution,\na muon-spin precession corresponding to the formation of\na long-range magnetic order has been observed for y(Zn)\n= 0.0075 \u2212 0.03 in x = 0.10, 0.115, 0.13. [11] Moreover,\nthe further Zn substitution of y(Zn) > 0.03 brings about\na change to slow depolarization of muon spins so that\nGaussian-like depolarization has been observed for y(Zn)\n= 0.10. These results indicate that a magnetic order\nis stabilized by a slight amount of Zn, while it is destroyed by a large amount of Zn, which is understandable\nin terms of the pinning and destruction of the stripe order\nby Zn. [15, 16, 17] For the Ni substitution, on the other\n\n\f2\nhand, a muon-spin precession has been observed for y(Ni)\n\u2265 0.02 up to 0.10 in x = 0.13. [12] These indicate that the\nformation of a magnetic order requires a larger amount of\nNi than that of Zn and that the magnetic order survives,\nor rather, it is stabilized by a large amount of Ni. From\nthe \u03c7 measurements on field cooling, it has been found\nthat the Meissner volume fraction corresponding to the\nsuperconducting (SC) volume fraction rapidly decreases\nwith a slight substitution of Zn and its decrease is more\nmarked by Zn than by Ni. In comparison between the\nvolume fraction of the SC state estimated from \u03c7 and\nthat of the magnetic state from \u03bcSR, it has been found\nthat the SC region in a sample is in good correspondence\nto the region in which Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond the\n\u03bcSR frequency window (106 \u2212 1011 Hz). From the viewpoint of impurity effects on the stripe order, these results\nsuggest that (i) the dynamical stripe correlations tend to\nbe pinned and stabilized by both Zn and Ni so that the\nsuperconductivity is destroyed around themselves, and\nthat (ii) Zn is more effective for the pinning of stripes so\nthat the static stripe-ordered region around Zn is larger\nthan around Ni. These may be the reason why Zn destroys the superconductivity in the hole-doped high-Tc\ncuprates more markedly than Ni. [1]\nIn this paper, in order to investigate the relationship\nbetween the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity\nin the optimally doped high-Tc cuprates, we have performed ZF-\u03bcSR and \u03c7 measurements in the Zn- or Nisubstituted La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15,\nchanging y up to 0.10 in fine step. [18, 19] Moreover, we\nhave extended the measurements for the Zn-substituted\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Zny O4 up to x = 0.20, focusing on the\nrelationship between the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity in the overdoped regime.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nPolycrystalline samples of La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4\nwith x = 0.15 \u2212 0.20 and y = 0 \u2212 0.10 were prepared by\nthe ordinal solid-state reaction method. Details of the\nprocedure have been reported in our former paper. [11]\nFor the Ni-substituted samples, however, the sintering\nwas done in air at 1150 o C for 24 h to keep the homogeneity of constituents in a sample.\nThe ZF-\u03bcSR measurements were performed at the\nRIKEN-RAL Muon Facility at the Rutherford-Appleton\nLaboratory in the UK, using a pulsed positive surface\nmuon beam with an incident muon momentum of 27\nMeV/c. The asymmetry parameter A(t) at a time t was\ngiven by A(t) = {F (t) \u2212 \u03b1B(t)}/{F (t) + \u03b1B(t)}, where\nF (t) and B(t) are total muon events of the forward and\nbackward counters, which were aligned in the beam line,\nrespectively. The \u03b1 is the calibration factor reflecting\nthe relative counting efficiencies between the forward and\nbackward counters. The \u03bcSR time spectrum, namely, the\ntime evolution of A(t) was measured at low temperatures\ndown to 0.3 K to detect the appearance of a magnetic or-\n\nder.\nThe \u03c7 measurements were carried out down to 2 K\nusing a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, Model\nMPMS-XL5) in a magnetic field of 10 Oe on field cooling,\nin order to evaluate the volume fraction of the SC region\nin a sample.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEffects of Zn and Ni substitution in x = 0.15\n1.\n\nZF-\u03bcSR\n\nFigure 1 shows the ZF-\u03bcSR time spectra in\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15. In order to\nsee the y dependence of the spectra at the lowest temperature of 0.3 K clearly, the time spectra at 0.3 K are\nalso shown in Fig. 2. All the spectra in Figs. 1 and 2\nis shown after subtracting the background from the raw\nspectra and being normalized by the value of the asymmetry at t = 0. At high temperatures above 15 K, all the\nspectra show Gaussian-like slow depolarization of muon\nspins due to the nuclear-dipole field randomly distributed\nat the muon site. This indicates no effect of Cu spins on\nthe \u03bcSR time spectrum. Focusing on the spectra below\n2 K, Gaussian-like depolarization is still observed down\nto 0.3 K for y = 0, indicating that Cu spins fluctuate fast\nbeyond the \u03bcSR frequency window. For the Zn substitution, the muon-spin depolarization becomes fast with\nincreasing y(Zn) for y(Zn) \u2265 0.0075. Moreover, an almost flat spectrum with the normalized asymmetry of\n\u223c 1/3 is observed above 0.4 \u03bcs for y(Zn) = 0.02 and\n0.03, indicating the formation of a static magnetic state.\nIt is noted that the absence of a muon-spin precession\nmay be due to a short-range magnetic order, resulting in\nvery fast damping of the precession, in contrast to the\nresults around x = 0.115. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] For y(Zn)\n> 0.03, the muon-spin depolarization becomes slow and\na Gaussian-like spectrum is observed, though the muonspin depolarization is still fast at 0.3 K for y(Zn) = 0.10.\nThis indicates that the magnetic order is destroyed by\na large amount of Zn, which is analogous to the results\naround x = 0.115. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] For the Ni substitution, on the other hand, fast depolarization is observed\nfor y(Ni) \u2265 0.0075. Eventually, a muon-spin precession\nis observed for y(Ni) = 0.10, indicating the formation of\na long-range magnetic order of Cu spins.\nAs for the comparison of the spectra between the Zn\nand Ni substitution, the fast depolarization of muon spins\nstarts to be observed at y = 0.0075 both in the Zn- and\nNi-substituted samples.

[12]\nIn order to obtain detailed information on the Cu-spin\ndynamics, we analyzed the time spectra shown in Figs.\n1 and 2 using the following three-component function.\nA(t) = A0 e\u2212\u03bb0 t GZ (\u2206, t) + A1 e\u2212\u03bb1 t + A2 e\u2212\u03bb2 t cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6).\n(3.1)\nThe first term represents the slowly depolarizing component in a region where the Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond\nthe \u03bcSR frequency window. The A0 and \u03bb0 are the initial\nasymmetry and depolarization rate of the slowly depolarizing component, respectively. The GZ (\u2206, t) is the static\nKubo-Toyabe function with a half width, \u2206, describing\nthe distribution of the nuclear-dipole field at the muon\nsite. [20] The second term represents the fast depolar-\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe first term is the same as that in Eq. (3.1). The\nsecond term is a simple Gaussian representing a region\nwith larger magnetic moments than nuclear moments being randomly distributed. [21] The time spectra are well\nfitted with Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2), as shown by solid lines\nin Figs. 1 and 2.\nFigure 3 shows the temperature dependence of A0 normalized by its value at a high temperature of 15 K or 20\nK for La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15. The\ntemperature dependence of A0 is often used as a probe\nof the magnetic transition, because it reflects the volume\nfraction of the nonmagnetic region. [22, 23, 24] In fact,\nA0 = 1 means that the spectrum is represented only with\nthe first term of Eq. (3.1) or (3.2), indicating that all the\nCu spins fluctuate fast beyond the \u03bcSR frequency window. On the contrary, A0 \u223c 1/3 indicates that all the\nCu spins are in the short- or long-range static magnetically ordered state. In Fig. 3, the shaded area at low\ntemperatures corresponds to the state in which the Cuspin fluctuations slow down and/or a magnetic order is\nformed. For the Zn substitution, A0 decreases around\ny(Zn) = 0.01 \u2212 0.03 at 2 K, while the area in which A0\ndecreases expands at low temperatures below 2 K, indicating that the Cu-spin correlation is developed with decreasing temperature in the Zn-substituted samples. Focusing on the temperature, TNonset , at which A0 starts to\ndecrease with decreasing temperature, it increases with\nincreasing y(Zn) and shows the maximum around y(Zn)\n= 0.01 \u2212 0.02 and decreases above y(Zn) > 0.02, suggesting that the Cu-spin correlation develops most around\ny(Zn) = 0.01 \u2212 0.02. In fact, A0 is almost 1/3 below \u223c 1\nK for y(Zn) = 0.02 and 0.03, indicating a static magnetic\nstate. For y(Zn) > 0.03, the area in which A0 decreases\nshrinks with increasing y(Zn), but A0 is below the unity\nat low temperatures due to the random magnetism with\nmagnetic moments slightly larger than nuclear moments\neven for y(Zn) = 0.10.\nFor the Ni substitution, on the other hand, the de-\n\n\f5\n\nLa2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4\n\n8\n\nx = 0.15\n\nLa2-xSrxCu1-y(Zn,Ni)yO4\n6\n\n(K)\n\n0.8\n\nmid\n\n0.6\n\n4\n\nTN\n\nNormalized A0\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n\ny(Zn)\n\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\nx = 0.13 0.15\n\n20\n0\n0\n0.00\n\nT (K)\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nZn\n\n[11]\n\nNi\n\n[12]\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\ny (Zn,Ni)\n\nLa2-xSrxCu1-yNiyO4\n\nx = 0.15\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Impurity-concentration dependence of\nTNmid defined as the midpoint of the change of the A0 value\nfrom the unity to the averaged value of A0 in the ordered\nstate at 2 K for La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15.\nThe data of x = 0.13 are also plotted for comparison.

These indicate that the Cuspin correlation is developed at low temperatures also\nin the Ni-substituted samples. As for TNonset , it increases\nwith increasing y(Ni) and shows a local maximum around\ny(Ni) = 0.02 and changes to decrease above y(Ni) > 0.02,\nwhich is similar to the Zn-substituted case. For y(Ni)\n\nIt is found in the lightly substituted samples of y \u2264\n0.03 that the decrease in A0 with decreasing temperature\nis smaller in the Ni substitution than in the Zn substitution, suggesting that Zn is more effective for the development of the magnetic order than Ni. In the heavily\nsubstituted samples of y > 0.03, the Cu-spin correlation\ntends to be destroyed by Zn while it tends to be developed by Ni.\nFigure 4 shows the impurity-concentration dependence\nof the magnetic transition temperature, TNmid, defined as\nthe midpoint of the change of the A0 value from the unity\nto the averaged value of A0 in the static magnetic state\nat 2 K, [11] in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15.\nThe data of x = 0.13 are also plotted for comparison. [11,\n12] In the Zn-substituted samples with x = 0.15, TNmid\nappears at y(Zn) = 0.0075 and shows the maximum at\ny(Zn) = 0.02, followed by the disappearance for y(Zn) >\n0.03. In the Ni-substituted samples with x = 0.15, on the\nother hand, TNmid appears at y(Ni) = 0.02 and increases\nmonotonically with increasing y(Ni).

The Tc decreases with increasing y in\nboth Zn- and Ni-substituted samples and disappears at\ny(Zn) = 0.03 and y(Ni) = 0.05, respectively. Moreover,\nit is found that the absolute value of \u03c7 at 2 K, |\u03c72K |, corresponding to the SC volume fraction decreases markedly\nwith increasing y in both Zn- and Ni-substituted samples\nand the decrease is more marked in the former than in\nthe latter. These results suggest that the SC volume fraction decreases more markedly through the Zn substitution than through the Ni substitution, which is analogous\nto the results in x = 0.13. [12]\n\n3.\n\nVolume fractions of SC and magnetic regions\n\nWe estimated volume fractions of different states of\nCu spins in one sample related to the three terms in Eq.\n(3.1) and two terms in Eq. (3.2), using the best-fit values of A0 , A1 , A2 and A\u03c3 . Details of the estimation\nof the volume fractions were described in our previous\npaper. [11] It is noted in the estimation that the region\nexpressed by A1 , corresponding to the region in which\nthe Cu-spin fluctuations slow down and/or a short-range\nmagnetic order is formed at low temperatures, is called\nthe A1 region. Similarly, regions expressed by A0 , A2\n\nand A\u03c3 are called A0 , A2 and A\u03c3 regions, respectively.\nVolume fractions of A0 , A1 , A2 and A\u03c3 regions are denoted as VA0 , VA1 , VA2 and VA\u03c3 , respectively. Figure 6\ndisplays the impurity-concentration dependence of VA0 ,\nVA1 , VA2 and VA\u03c3 at 0.3 K for La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4\nwith x = 0.15. For the Zn substitution, VA0 rapidly decreases with increasing y(Zn) and becomes almost zero\nat y(Zn) = 0.03. Instead, VA1 increases and becomes almost 100 % at y(Zn) = 0.03, indicating that the Cu-spin\nfluctuations slow down and/or the short-range magnetic\norder is formed in the whole area of the sample of y(Zn)\n= 0.03. For y(Zn) = 0.10, VA0 is not zero but about 10\n% and almost all area of the sample is covered with the\nA\u03c3 region.\nFor the Ni substitution, on the other hand, the decrease in VA0 is weak at y(Ni) = 0.0075, while VA0 rapidly\ndecreases for y(Ni) > 0.0075 and reaches zero at y(Ni)\n\u223c 0.05. The trend that the formation of the magnetic\norder requires a larger amount of Ni than that of Zn is\nthe same as in the case of x = 0.13. [12] The A2 region\nstarts to appear at y(Ni) = 0.03 \u2212 0.10. In spite of large\nerror bars of VA0 , VA1 and VA2 , the temperature dependence of VA2 allows us to conclude that the A2 region is\nformed almost entirely in the sample of y(Ni) = 0.10.\nNext, the SC volume fraction at 2 K, VSC , was estimated from |\u03c72K | shown in Fig. 5. The value of VSC for\neach y is normalized by its value at y = 0. The impurityconcentration dependence of VSC is plotted in Fig. 6. For\nthe Zn substitution, VSC rapidly decreases with increasing y(Zn), changes to slowly decrease for y(Zn) \u2265 0.02\nand finally disappears for y(Zn) \u2265 0.03. The y dependence of VSC for the Ni substitution is analogous to the\ny dependence of VSC for the Zn substitution, though values of VSC for y(Ni) = 0.0025 \u2212 0.01 are scattered around\n85 %. The decrease is, however, weaker through the Ni\nsubstitution than through the Zn substitution. In comparison between the SC and magnetic volume fractions,\nthe y dependence of VSC and VA0 is roughly similar to\neach other in qualitative viewpoint for the Zn substitution. For the Ni substitution, on the other hand, the tendency of the decrease of VSC and VA0 seems to be similar\nto each other. Therefore, at the lowest temperature of\n0.3 K, the A0 region is in rough correspondence to the\nSC region in both Zn- and Ni-substituted samples. These\nresults are similar to those obtained in x = 0.13, [12] in\nwhich the A0 region is in rough correspondence to the\nSC region in both Zn- and Ni-substituted samples.\n\nB.\n\nEffect of Zn substitution in x = 0.18 and 0.20\n\nThe ZF-\u03bcSR time spectra in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Zny O4\nwith x = 0.18 and 0.20 are shown in Fig. 1.

It is found in the y dependence of VSC in Fig. 8\nthat VSC 's of x = 0.18 and 0.20 are roughly located on the\nsame line. That is, the magnitude of the suppression of\nthe SC volume fraction by the Zn substitution is similar\nto each other in the overdoped samples of x = 0.18 and\n0.20.\n\ndependence of A0 that TNonset decreases with increasing\nx up to x = 0.20. [26] These indicate that the Cu-spin\nfluctuations slow down at low temperatures even in the\noverdoped regime of La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Zny O4 , which is in\nsharp contrast with the conclusion by Panagopoulos et\nal. that the Zn-induced slowing down disappears above\nthe possible quantum critical point of x \u223c 0.19. [27, 28]\nThe reason for the sharp contrast is that they made \u03bcSR\nmeasurements not for y(Zn) = 0.03 but for y(Zn) = 0.01,\n0.02 and 0.05.\n\nThe Zn-concentration dependence of VA0 at 0.3 K for\nx = 0.15, 0.18 and 0.20 is shown in Fig. 8.

Figure 9 displays schematic pictures of\nthe spatial distribution of A0 and A1 regions with different Cu-spin states at 0.3 K for typical y values in\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15, on the assumption that the magnetic order is developed around\neach Zn or Ni for lightly Zn- or Ni-substituted samples.\nThis assumption has not yet been confirmed directly\nbut is reasonable, referring to the results of scanningtunneling-microscopy measurements in the Zn- or Nisubstituted Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O8+\u03b4 . [29, 30] Sizes\nof the circles were calculated from the ratio of VA0 : VA1\nin each y. It is noted from the calculation in each y that\nthe size of the circle was found to be almost independent\nof y. For the impurity-free sample of y = 0, the A0 region covers the whole area of the CuO2 plane where the\nsuperconductivity appears. Through the 0.75 % substitution of Zn for Cu, A1 regions, namely, slowly fluctuating\n\nand/or short-range magnetically ordered regions of Cu\nspins are formed with the radius, rab , \u223c 23 \u00c5 around\neach Zn in the A0 region, namely, in the fast fluctuating sea of Cu spins. It is found that a large part of the\nCuO2 plane is covered with A1 regions, so that VSC in\nrough correspondence to VA0 is strongly diminished. In\ncomparison between rab and the mean distance between\nZn atoms <RZn\u2212Zn > \u223c 44 \u00c5 at y(Zn) = 0.0075, A1 regions overlap one another mostly. With increasing y(Zn),\nA1 regions become dominant and the whole area of the\nCuO2 plane is covered with A1 regions for y(Zn) = 0.03,\nindicating that the superconductivity is completely suppressed. In the case of x = 0.13, once A1 regions start\nto overlap one another, A2 regions corresponding to a\nlong-range magnetically ordered regions start to be developed. [11] For x = 0.15, on the contrary, A2 regions are\nnot generated in spite of the overlap between A1 regions.\nThe reason may be due to a shorter-range magnetic order\nin x = 0.15 than in x = 0.13.\nFor the Ni substitution, on the other hand, A1 regions\nappear through the 0.75 % substitution and rab is estimated to be \u223c 11 \u00c5, which is smaller than that around\nZn. These indicate that A1 regions do not overlap one\nanother mostly. For y(Ni) = 0.03, a large part of the\nCuO2 plane is covered with A1 regions. These changes\nwith increasing y for both Zn- and Ni-substituted samples\nsuggest that the SC region competes with slowly fluctuating and/or short-range magnetically ordered regions of\nCu spins.\nAs seen in the case of y = 0.0075, the size of each A1 region is larger around Zn than around Ni, which is similar\nto the case of x = 0.13 as shown in Fig. 9. [12] Itoh et al.\nhave reported from NQR measurements in the Zn- and\nNi-substituted YBa2 (Cu1\u2212y My )4 O8 (M = Zn, Ni) that\nthe size of the wipeout region where the Cu-spin correlation is developed is \u223c 6 \u00c5 around Zn, while in the case\nof Ni, it is limited just on the Ni site. [31] The difference\nbetween Zn and Ni substitution is qualitatively similar to\nthat in our present results. The quantitative difference\nbetween the NQR and our \u03bcSR results is probably due\nto the difference that the time scale of the Cu-spin fluctuations observed by NQR is longer than that by \u03bcSR.\nIt is noted, on the other hand, that Ouazi et al. have reported contrasting results on the Zn- and Ni-substitution\neffects from NMR measurements in partially Zn- and Nisubstituted YBa2 Cu3 O7 . [32] They have suggested that\nboth Zn and Ni induce a staggered paramagnetic polarization with the typical extension \u03be = 3 cell units for Zn\nand \u03be \u2265 3 for Ni, which is inconsistent with our model\nand Ref. [31], though the exact reason has not yet been\nclarified.\nAs for the difference between results in x = 0.15 and in\nx = 0.13, as shown in the case of x = 0.15 and y = 0.0075\nand the case of x = 0.13 and y = 0.0025 in Fig. 9, rab is\nsmaller in x = 0.15 even at 0.3 K than in x = 0.13 at 2 K\nfor both Zn and Ni substitution. These indicate that the\ndevelopment of the Cu-spin correlation around Zn and\nNi is less in x = 0.15 than in x = 0.13. The reason is\n\n\f9\n\nLa2-xSrxCu1-y(Zn,Ni)yO4\n\nx = 0.15, T = 0.3 K\n\nA0: Fast fluctuation\n(Superconducting)\n\ny=0\n\nNi\n\nZn\nZn\n\nNi\nrab ~ 11\n\nrab ~ 23\n\ny = 0.0075\n<RZn-Zn> ~ 44\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0002\n\n<RNi-Ni> ~ 44\n\n\u0003\n\nA1: Slow fluctuation and/or incoherent order\n\ny = 0.03\n<RZn-Zn> ~ 22\n\n\u0005\n\n<RNi-Ni> ~ 22\n\nLa2-xSrxCu1-y(Zn,Ni)yO4\n\n<RZn-Zn> ~ 76\n\ny = 0.0025\n\n\u0004\n\nx = 0.13, T = 2 K [12]\n\n\u0006\n\nNi3+ or the substituted Ni2+ tends to trap a hole and\nform the so-called Zhang-Rice singlet state at low temperatures in which the hole is localized, leading to the\ndecrease in the effective hole concentration, peff , as in\nthe case of doped La2 NiO4 . [36, 37] In any case, Ni spins\nare effectively regarded as S = 1/2, suggesting that the\nNi substitution for Cu does not destroy the Cu-spin correlation with S = 1/2. In the present results, however,\nthe depolarization of muon spins in the \u03bcSR time spectra becomes fast progressively with increasing y(Ni) as\nshown in Figs. 1 and 2, indicating the development of\nthe Cu-spin correlation.\nOn the other hand, one may claim that the decrease\nin peff by the Ni substitution results in transfer into the\nunderdoped regime, leading to the development of the\nCu-spin correlation. Supposed that each Ni traps a hole,\nfor example, peff of the 2 % Ni-substituted sample with\nx = 0.15 should be in correspondence to that of the Nifree sample with x = 0.13. This is, however, inconsistent\nwith the result that the former shows a fast depolarization of muon spins as shown in Fig. 1 while the latter does\nnot at 2 K. [12] Therefore, it appears that Ni does not\nnecessarily trap one hole exactly for the optimally doped\nx = 0.15 in comparison with x = 0.05 \u2212 0.07. [34, 35]\nIn any case, further experiments are necessary to draw a\nconclusion.\n\n<RNi-Ni> ~ 76\n\nC.\nrab ~ 36\n\n\u0007\n\nrab ~ 25\n\nFIG. 9: (color online) Schematic pictures of the spatial distribution of different Cu-spin states in the CuO2 plane, corresponding to A0 and A1 , at 0.3 K for typical y values in\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15.

[12]\n\ndiscussed in Sec. IV C.\n\nB.\n\nRelation to the spin-charge stripe order\n\n\b\n\nEffect of Ni substitution\n\nNakano et al. have insisted from \u03c7 measurements in\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Niy O4 that Ni tends to be substituted as\nNi3+ (the spin quantum number S = 1/2) instead of\nNi2+ for y(Ni) \u2264 0.01 in x = 0.15. [33] Moreover, Matsuda et al. [34] and Hiraka et al. [35] have insisted from\nneutron-scattering experiments in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Niy O4\nwith x = 0.05 \u2212 0.07 that Ni tends to be substituted as\n\nAs mentioned in Sec. I, in the case of x = 0.13, it\nhas been concluded that non-SC regions around Zn and\nNi are in correspondence to regions where the dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes are pinned and\nlocalized to be a static stripe order by Zn and Ni. [12]\nFor the Zn substitution, rab estimated at 2 K shows the\nmaximum around x = 0.115 in x = 0.10 \u2212 0.13. [11] As\nmentioned above, moreover, rab is smaller in x = 0.15\neven at 0.3 K than in x = 0.13 at 2 K. This is also the\ncase for the Ni substitution. This nonmonotonic x dependence of rab eliminates the explanation that the magnetically ordered regions around impurities become small\ndue to weakening of the Cu-spin correlation by doped\nholes. Rather, this result suggests that the dynamical\nstripe correlations are pinned and localized around Zn\nand Ni, leading to the formation of the static stripe order.\nThis is because the dynamical stripe correlations develop\nmost around x = 0.115. [38] In fact, from elastic neutronscattering measurements in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4\nwith x = 0.15, [6] incommensurate elastic magnetic peaks\ncorresponding to the formation of the static spin stripe\norder have been confirmed for y(Zn) = 0.017 and for\ny(Ni) = 0.029.\nTo be summarized, the present results can be understood by the concept of the stripe pinning that the\ndynamical stripe correlations are pinned and localized\naround Zn and Ni, so that the static stripe order is formed\nand frequencies of the Cu-spin fluctuations come into the\n\n\f10\n\u03bcSR frequency window at low temperatures. The difference in size of the non-SC and stripe-pinned region between Zn- and Ni-substituted samples can be interpreted\nas described precisely in the former paper, [12] taking\ninto account the difference in the total energy of the superexchange energy between Cu spins and the transfer\nintegral of holes between two cases; one is the case that\nZn or Ni is located at a charge (hole) stripe and the other\nis the case that Zn or Ni is at a spin stripe.\n\nD.\n\nComparison with neutron-scattering results\n\nKimura et al. [5] and Kofu et al. [6] have reported from inelastic neutron-scattering experiments in\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with x = 0.15 that a gap\nopens in the low-energy spin excitation spectrum for the\nimpurity-free sample of y = 0, while an in-gap state appears through the Zn substitution so that incommensurate elastic magnetic peaks are observed for y(Zn)\n\u2265 0.017. For the Ni substitution, on the other hand, the\ngap energy decreases with increasing y(Ni) and incommensurate elastic magnetic peaks are observed for y(Ni)\n\u2265 0.029. Our present results that the formation of the\nmagnetic order requires a larger amount of Zn than that\nof Ni are consistent with their neutron-scattering results\nthat elastic magnetic peaks start to be observed at y(Zn)\n= 0.017 and y(Ni) = 0.029. On the other hand, slowing\ndown of the Cu-spin fluctuations is observed below 2 K\nin the \u03bcSR time spectra for y(Zn) = 0.0075, while incommensurate elastic magnetic peaks are unobservable\ndown to 1.5 K in the neutron-scattering measurements\nfor y(Zn) \u223c 0.0075. These suggest that the Cu-spin correlation is locally developed only around Zn or Ni and are\ndetectable by means of \u03bcSR being able to probe the local\nCu-spin correlation. This is consistent with our proposed\nmodel shown in Fig. 9.\n\nE.\n\nRelation between the Cu-spin dynamics and\nsuperconductivity in the overdoped regime\n\nFor the Zn-substituted samples of x \u2264 0.15, VA0 and\nVSC are in rough correspondence to each other, suggesting that the non-SC region around Zn roughly corresponds to the region where the dynamical stripe correlations are pinned and stabilized. [11] In the overdoped\nregime of x = 0.20, as shown in Fig. 8, the y dependence\nof VA0 and VSC seems to be similar to each other from\nthe qualitative viewpoint. These suggest that the superconductivity is realized in a region in which Cu-spins\nfluctuate fast beyond the \u03bcSR frequency window even\nin the overdoped regime. It is noted for x = 0.20 that\nVA0 starts to decrease with increasing y(Zn) above y(Zn)\n= 0.01, suggesting that more than 1 % Zn is required\nfor the pinning and stabilization of the dynamical stripe\ncorrelations due to weakening of the Cu-spin correlation\nin the overdoped regime.\n\nIt is found that VSC is larger than VA0 in each y for\nx = 0.15. In the overdoped regime of x = 0.20, on the\nother hand, VSC is smaller than VA0 in each y. One may\nclaim that in the overdoped regime, the development of\nthe Cu-spin correlation tends to be weakened and lower\ntemperatures than 0.3 K are needed to observe the development of the Cu-spin correlation. We have performed,\nhowever, ZF-\u03bcSR measurements for x = 0.20 and y(Zn)\n= 0.03 down to 0.02 K and found almost no development of the Cu-spin correlation more than 0.3 K. [25, 26]\nThe smaller VSC than VA0 in the overdoped regime of\nx = 0.20 is possibly explained by the inhomogeneity of\nsuperconductivity. Formerly, transverse-field \u03bcSR experiments have revealed the decrease in the SC carrier density with increasing hole concentration in the overdoped\nregime of Tl2 Ba2 CuO6+\u03b4 . [39, 40, 41] Moreover, \u03c7 measurements have revealed the decrease in the SC volume\nfraction with increasing hole concentration in the overdoped regime of La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 . [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] These\nsuggest the occurrence of a phase separation into SC and\nnormal-state regions in the overdoped high-Tc cuprates.\nFor x = 0.20, it is considered that a small amount of\nnon-SC regions are formed in the CuO2 plane. In this\ncase, due to the reduction of the SC volume fraction in\nthe phase-separated state, it is reasonable that VSC is\nsmaller than VA0 in each y for x = 0.20.\nTo be summarized, it appears in the overdoped regime\nwhere the phase separation into SC and normal-state\nregions takes place that the dynamical stripe correlations are pinned and localized around Zn in the SC region, resulting in the decrease in VA0 and VSC . With\nincreasing x, owing to the decrease in the SC volume\nfraction and weakening of the Cu-spin correlation, it\nis possible that the volume fraction of the slowly fluctuating and/or short-range magnetically ordered region\nof Cu spins decreases and finally reaches zero at the\nboundary between the SC and normal-state phases in\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 . [25, 26, 47]\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nEffects of Zn and Ni impurities on the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity have been investigated\nfrom the ZF-\u03bcSR and \u03c7 measurements for the optimally\ndoped and overdoped La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y (Zn,Ni)y O4 with\nx = 0.15, 0.18 and 0.20, changing y up to 0.10 in fine\nstep. In the optimally doped x = 0.15, the ZF-\u03bcSR\nmeasurements have revealed that, for both Zn- and Nisubstituted samples, the Cu-spin fluctuations start to exhibit slowing down at y = 0.0075 with increasing y. The\ndepolarization of muon spins is, however, faster in the\nZn-substituted sample than in the Ni-substituted one.\nThese results indicate that the formation of a magnetic\norder requires a larger amount of Ni than that of Zn,\nwhich is similar to our previous results for x = 0.13. The\n\u03c7 measurements have revealed that the SC volume fraction strongly decreases by a small amount of Zn and the\n\n\f11\ndecrease is more marked than by a small amount of Ni,\nwhich is also similar to our previous results for x = 0.13.\nFrom the estimation of volume fractions of the SC and\nmagnetic regions for x = 0.15, it has been found that\nthe size of each region where Cu-spin fluctuations exhibit slowing down is larger around Zn than around Ni,\nwhich is similar to the case of x = 0.13. Moreover, it has\nbeen found that the region where Cu spins fluctuate fast\nbeyond the \u03bcSR frequency window is in rough correspondence to the SC region in both Zn- and Ni-substituted\nsamples. According to the concept of the stripe pinning,\nit follows that the dynamical stripe correlations of spins\nand holes are pinned and localized around Zn and Ni even\nfor x = 0.15, leading to the formation of the static stripe\norder and the suppression of superconductivity. These\nmay indicate an importance of the dynamical stripe in\nthe appearance of the high-Tc superconductivity in the\nhole-doped cuprates.\nAs for the overdoped regime of x = 0.18 and 0.20,\nZn-induced slowing down of the Cu-spin fluctuations has\nalso been observed for y(Zn) = 0.02 \u2212 0.03, though the\nslowing down has been weakened progressively with an\n\nincrease in x. These suggest the occurrence of the stripe\npinning even in the overdoped regime. In comparison\nbetween volume fractions of SC and magnetic regions,\nthe region where Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond the \u03bcSR\nfrequency window seems to be in rough correspondence\nto the SC region even in the overdoped regime. It appears\nthat a pinning and stabilization of the dynamical stripe\ncorrelations takes place in the SC regions in the phaseseparated state into SC and normal-state regions in the\noverdoped high-Tc cuprates.\n\n[1] G.
