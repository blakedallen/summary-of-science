The narrow widths of the J/\u03c8 and\nsubsequently observed \u03a5 led to their interpretation in terms of new quark\nflavors (see for example [1]). These mesons were quarkonium states which\npredominantly decayed via the electroweak interaction. In a potential quark\nmodel their leptonic widths were first calculated [2] using\n\u0393ee \u2261 \u0393V \u2192e\u2212\n\ne+\n\n= 16\u03c0\u03b12EM\n\nq2\n|\u03c8(0)|2\nMV2\n\n(1)\n\nwith q the charge of the quark in electron units, MV the resonance mass and\n\u03c8(0) the wavefunction at the origin. The quantity |\u03c8(0)|2 also appears in the\nmatrix element of the hyperfine interaction [1] and therefore its model value for\nthe hyperfine splitting, \u2206Mhyp , in meson spectra (pseudoscalar-vector meson\nmass differences) should be simultaneously tested. This also provides a relation\nbetween the leptonic width and the hyperfine splitting\n\u2206Mhyp =\n\n1\n6\n\n\u0012\n\n9\n\u03b12EM\n\n\u0393ee\nMV\n\n\u00134/3\n\nMV .\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\n\nFelipe J. Llanes-Estrada and Stephen R. Cotanch\n\nHowever, using this result and the known \u03c0-\u03c1 mass difference, the first prediction [1] for the charmonium hyperfine splitting failed dramatically. Subsequently, quark models, such as Ref. [3], incorporating a complex, flavor dependent hyperfine interaction were able to reproduce the hyperfine splittings in\nvarious circumstances but fine-tuning was still required since these approaches\ndid not include chiral symmetry. The key point is that the pion is the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry which is responsible for\nits light mass. Indeed more recent and improved chiral approaches [4, 5] find\nthat about 70 % of the \u03c0-\u03c1 splitting is due to chiral symmetry. Consequently,\nattributing this large 600 MeV splitting entirely to the hyperfine interaction\ncan lead to an inconsistent description of other, less dramatic spectra splittings in baryons, heavy mesons and light meson excited states.\nA more fundamental treatment is provided by field-theoretical quark models that dynamically incorporate chiral symmetry. The Nambu and JonaLasinio model is one example but the signature contact interaction precludes\ndescribing radial excitations (as well as confinement). A similar problem\nplagues contemporary covariant formulations of the Schwinger-Dyson and\nBethe-Salpeter equations that generate unphysical states corresponding to\nrelative time excitations. A more promising approach, which we have utilized\n[5], is to diagonalize an effective QCD Hamiltonian in the Coulomb-gauge\nusing the chiral symmetry preserving Random Phase Approximation [RPA].\nIn this paper we apply the RPA to predict vector meson leptonic widths.\nIn addition to further testing our model by confrontation with data we also\ndiscuss exotic baryonium states. In view of the recent resonance discovered at\nBES [6] with a nucleon-antinucleon bound state interpretation [7, 8], we comment on possible vector states in the 1800 M eV region, focusing on the quark\nmodel's, as yet undiscovered, \u03c6(1880) that naturally fits in our approach.\n\n2 Vector Meson Self-Energy and Width\nThe width, \u0393 , of a hadron is inversely related to its lifetime and can be\nobtained from its self-energy, \u03a3(p2 ), by Im \u03a3(M 2 ) = \u0393/2 for a particle with\nmass M and momentum p. For a vector meson the appropriate self-energy\ncontribution at the one e\u2212 e+ loop level can be computed from the diagram\nin Fig. 1. This yields\ng(M 2 )2\n\u03a0(M 2 )\n(3)\n\u03a3=i\nM2\nwhere g(p2 ) is the meson-photon transition form factor and \u03a0(p2 ) is obtained\nfrom the photon polarization tensor with form governed by gauge invariance\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (p2 ) = (g\u03bc\u03bd p2 \u2212 p\u03bc p\u03bd )\u03a0(p2 ) .\n\n(4)\n\n\fRPA Vector Meson Leptonic Widths\n\n3\n\n\u0003\n\np\nig (p)\n\nFig. 1. Feynman diagram for the one loop e\u2212 e+ contribution to the self-energy\nof a meson (solid line) with momeum p. All hadron information is contained in the\ntransition form factor g(p).\n\nApplying standard QED covariant perturbation theory to evaluate the\nphoton polarization tensor yields\nZ\nTr(\u03b3\u03bc 6 q\u03b3\u03bd (6 q+ 6 p))\nd4 q\n.\n(5)\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u2243 \u2212e2\n4\n(2\u03c0) (q 2 + i\u01eb)((q + p)2 + i\u01eb)\nNote we have neglected the electron's mass since it is a small effect. Related,\nEq. (5) also represents the one loop \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ contribution in the zero mass limit\nand, as suggested by Table 1, this mass can also be neglected since \u0393\u03bc\u03bc is\nessentially equal to \u0393ee within experimental error. This conclusion is reinforced\nby \u0393\u03bc\u03bc being randomly larger or smaller than \u0393ee , since phase space would\nindicate it to be smaller. Further, the decay width for \u03a5 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 + is also known\nand is compatible with the widths for \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ and e\u2212 e+ as well. The effect of\nthe \u03bc mass should be maximal for the \u03c1 and \u03c9 widths where the momentum of\nthe outgoing particles is not as large. The relevant correction (see discussion\nbelow), 4m4\u03bc /p4 , produces a 10 % suppression which is less than experimental\nerror.\nTable 1. Observed vector meson masses and leptonic widths.

[3] we use their fV values and again available physical meson\nmasses. Combining the different models it is clear that we have a reasonable\ntheoretical understanding of vector meson dileptonic decay.\n\n4 Mesons with Broad Hadronic Widths\nFor vector meson decay to a particle-antiparticle hadron pair, annihilation to\na virtual photon is possible which also contributes to the total lepton width.\nIn this section we will demonstrate that such rescattering corrections are small\nin comparison with the intrinsic quark-antiquark annihilation contribution. A\ntypical example of a broad vector meson width is the \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0. We assume\nthat the true eigenstate of the full QCD Hamiltonian also contains a two-pion\nwavefunction component\n|\u03c1i = \u03b1|q q\u0304i + \u03b2|\u03c0\u03c0i +***\n\n(26)\n\nwith |\u03b2| < 1. We have previously calculated the decay of the q q\u0304 component\ninto e\u2212 e+ and now proceed to estimate the contribution from the |\u03c0\u03c0i term.\nIn principle this higher Fock-space wavefunction component could be computed from the same model Hamiltonian employed in the q q\u0304 two-body sector\nsince it is field-theory based. However this is a challenging calculation involving four relativistic particles and chiral symmetry. Although a formalism has\nbeen developed [14] to treat this problem, for an order of magnitude estimate\nwe instead implement a simple model wavefunction and adopt the following\nansatz for the V = \u03c1 two-pion component\n\u221a i abc\nZ\n3k\u0302 \u01eb\n\u0393\u03c0\u03c0 /2\nd3 k\n\u221a\n\u221a\nV i a\u2020 (p = (MV , 0))|\u03a9i =\n(2\u03c0)3 4\u03c0 2 MV \u2212 2Ek \u2212 i\u0393V /2\ns\n2(2\u03c0)3 1 b\u2020 c\u2020\n\u221a \u03c0 \u03c0 |\u03a9i .\n(27)\n2MV kEk 2 k \u2212k\np\nHere Ek = M\u03c02 + k 2 , \u0393V is the total V width and \u0393\u03c0\u03c0 is the width for\nthe \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay. The indices a, b and c now denote charge states. This wavefunction is inspired by the scattering amplitude for h+ h\u2212 hadrons coupled to\nangular momentum 1 near a resonance described by the Breit-Wigner amplitude\nMV \u0393hh /2\na1 (s) = \u2212\n(28)\ns \u2212 MV2 + iMV \u0393V\nor in the V rest frame with E = MV + i\u0393V /2\na1 (E) =\n\ni\u0393hh\n\u0393hh /2\n.\n=\nMV \u2212 E \u2212 i\u0393V /2\n2\u0393V\n\n(29)\n\n\fRPA Vector Meson Leptonic Widths\n\nThe normalization is given by\ni\nh\n\u2032\nh\u03a9| V i a , V j a \u2020 |\u03a9i\nh\u03a9|\u03a9i\n\n\u2032\n\n= \u03b4 aa \u03b4 ij (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4 3 (0) N 2\n\nwhere the factor N 2 (smaller than unity) is\nZ \u221e\n2\n1\n\u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n/4\n2\nN =\ndE\n2\n2MV 2m\u03c0\n(E \u2212 MV ) + \u0393V2 /4\n\n9\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\nand represents the probability of finding a pion pair with relative momentum given by the Breit-Wigner distribution. This determines the \u03b2 coefficient\nabove.

This reflects short range physics and the\nneed for a counterterm in the vector current of Eq. (32). Since the \"contact\"\npart of the decay has been calculated using the RPA, the counterterm coefficient (or simply the cutoff in the integral) could be fixed by the difference\nbetween the physical and RPA lepton widths. But this generates an unnaturally large cutoff which is not expected for pions with energies comparable to\nthe mass V , i.e. pion pairs with energies beyond a GeV from the resonance\nshould not appreciably contribute. A third way to regularize the integral is to\nallow for an energy-dependent width that localizes the integrand. In principle\n\n\f10\n\nFelipe J. Llanes-Estrada and Stephen R. Cotanch\nTable 4.

The results for the e\u2212 e+ widths corresponding to\nthe three lowest \u03c1 states are presented in Table 4 for different model parameters. The momentum cut-off is listed dimensionlessly, (\u039b \u2212 MV )/\u0393V , in terms\nof the V mass and width.\nNote that the rescattering contribution to the electron-positron widths are\nsuppressed relative to direct quark-antiquark annihilation by an order of magnitude. With this estimate and the present experimental width precision, the\nRPA calculation appears to provide a sufficient description without the need\nfor rigorously including hadron final-state interactions. Further, rescattering\neffects for other meson decays can be even smaller. For example, in odd G\nparity \u03c9-type meson decays to three or more (odd) particle states, the final\nstate mesons are very unlikely to recombine and annihiliate to a photon. Also\nthe \u03c6 and several other quarkonium states have narrow widths because they\nare near or below hadronic decay thresholds. Finally, the \u03c6(1680) has an \u03c9like decay pattern with dominant K \u2217 K decay products which cannot directly\nannihilate into a single photon.\n\n5 Towards baryonium\nThe short-ranged (weak) N N interaction, VN N , can only produce a single\nbound state, the deuteron. In contrast, for the N N\u0304 system the stronger VN N\u0304\ninteraction obtained from VN N using G parity can support several bound\nstates. However, because of annihilation and also mixing and decay to other\nbaryon number zero hadrons (mesons), it has long been believed that baryonium states, if found, would be quite broad. Significantly, BES has reported [6] a dramatic narrow enhancement in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp\u0304 but\nnot in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c00 pp\u0304. This indicates the possibility of an I = 0, as opposed to\nI = 1, bound state not far below threshold [8]. The quantum numbers of this\nstate are likely to be either J P C = 0\u2212+ or 0++ . If it is a pseudoscalar state, it\ncannot be explained in a q q\u0304 model since the expected excited \u03c0 and \u03b7 states\nin this region have already been identified as the \u03c0(1800) and \u03b7(1760).\nThe baryonium interpretation of this resonance suggests the pseudoscalar\nassignment corresponding to para baryonium (nucleon and antinucleon spins\n\n\fRPA Vector Meson Leptonic Widths\n\n11\n\nantiparallel) which, in turn, implies a partner, ortho baryonium, with spins\nalligned having total J P C = 1\u2212\u2212 . A similar state is also suggested by the\nobserved low-energy proton timelike form factor behavior as well as by a\nJ P C = 1\u2212\u2212 resonance prediction using Vector Meson Dominance [15] just\nbelow the e\u2212 e+ \u2192 pp\u0304 threshold. Further, a state, with mass 1870(10) M eV\nand width 10(5) M eV , has also been reported by the Fenice collaboration\n[16] in e\u2212 e+ production but awaits confirmation. Another discrepancy with\nexpected phase-space is reported [17] in B \u2192 p\u0304pK.\nSince baryonium has conventional meson quantum numbers, it is difficult\nto disentangle from q q\u0304 and 2q-2q\u0304 states. In particular, quark models predict\nnumerous four-quark states that likely overlap forming a hadron continuum.\nThe best prospect for observing baryonium states would be if they had narrow widths (possibly due to significant quark recombination) and non-strange\ndecay products near the N N\u0304 threshold. Such states are predicted by the Resonating Group Method [18]. Because the BES and FENICE resonances both\nhave widths of order 10 M eV , Coulombic baryonium states bound by just\nQED are unlikely to be observed since these would have very narrow leptonic\nwidths given by\n4\n\u0393B\u2192e\u2212 e+ = \u03b15EM Mp /(2n)\n(36)\n3\nthat are of order 10 eV . Instead, we would anticipate one ortho and one para\nbaryonium level each with a typical width of order 10 MeV.\nExperimental information above threshold should be regarded more cautiously. As recently discussed [19], steep peaks in the nucleon timelike form\nfactors and J/\u03c8 decays could be simple threshold cusp effects. Consequently,\nbaryonium claims should focus below threshold on isolated peaks or dips in\nan observable like the unconfirmed dip at 1870 MeV in the total e\u2212 e+ annihilation cross section [16].\n\n6 \u03c6(1880)\nSince ortho baryonium is a vector state it should be readily accessible with\nnew high energy and luminosity e\u2212 e+ colliders, such as the envisioned DA\u03a6NE\nupgrade to 2 GeV [20]. In this energy region, the most likely hadron to be\nobserved is the excited \u03c6 meson, a combination of 2S and 1D waves, with\nmass 1880 M eV predicted by Isgur and Godfrey and 1790 M eV in our RPA\nmodel. As listed in Table 3, our calculated e\u2212 e+ width for this state is about\nhalf a keV .\nWe can also phenomenologically estimate this width using known data and\nflavor symmetry. Recall Weinberg's first sum rule\n1\nM\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1\u2192e\u2212 e+ = M\u03c9 \u0393\u03c9\u2192e\u2212 e+ + M\u03c6 \u0393\u03c6\u2192e\u2212 e+\n3\n\n(37)\n\n\f12\n\nFelipe J. Llanes-Estrada and Stephen R. Cotanch\n\nwhich appears reasonable [21] since the left and right sides of this equation\nare 1.758 and 1.754 M eV 2 , respectively. Assuming ideal mixing for the \u03c9-\u03c6\nsystem, we obtain\n2M\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1\u2192e\u2212 e+ = 9M\u03c6 \u0393\u03c6\u2192e\u2212 e+ = 18M\u03c9 \u0393\u03c9\u2192e\u2212 e+\n\n(38)\n\nwhich is satisfied to within 30 % (10.5, 11.6, 8.4 M eV 2 , respectively). Combining Eqs. (37) and (38) with the known [9] relative branching ratio\n\u0393\u03c1(1700)\u2192e\u2212 e+ \u0393\u03c1(1700)\u21922(\u03c0\u03c0)\n\u0393\u03c1(1700)\u2192all\nwe obtain the estimates, \u0393\u03c1(1700)\u2192e\u2212 e+ = 3.5(0.5) keV , \u0393\u03c6(1880)\u2192e\u2212 e+ =\n0.7(3) keV and \u0393\u03c9(1650)\u2192e\u2212 e+ = 0.4(2) keV . These are somewhat larger\nbut still in agreement with our model calculations. Therefore, in searching\nfor J = 1 baryonium candidates below the N N\u0304 threshold, there may be a\n\u03c6(1880) state with \u0393ee about half a keV which should be distinguishable by\nits kaon decay modes.\n\n7 Outlook\nRecent claims have again raised the question concerning the existence of baryonium states but more solid information is needed near the N N\u0304 threshold.\nThe upgrade of DA\u03a6NE to the 2 GeV range will provide a good opportunity\nfor further searches. A possible fruitful strategy would be to focus on e\u2212 e+\nannihilation into an even number of pions in isoscalar 1\u2212\u2212 states. Resonances,\nalthough not narrow, are anticipated and there are structure precursors [22]\nfrom other experiments. By extracting the leptonic widths, the missing \u03c6 state\nbelow 2 GeV should be found and we predict its lepton width to be around\nhalf a keV . Its hadron width should be similar to the \u03c9(1650), about 200\nM eV . Any other observed vector state is a candidate for ortho baryonium.\nThis work is supported by grants FPA 2000-0956, BFM 2002-01003 (MCYT,\nSpain) and DE-FG02-97ER41048 (US Department of Energy) and has been\ncommissioned for the \"Encuentro de F\u0131\u0301sica Fundamental Alberto Galindo\"\nmeeting at Univ.
