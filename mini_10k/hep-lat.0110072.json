We generate dynamical configurations with improved staggered and gauge actions and analyze\nthem for heavy-light physics with tadpole improved clover valence quarks. When the scale is set by m\u03c1 , we find\nan increase of \u2248 23% in fB with three dynamical flavors over the quenched case. Discretization errors appear to\nbe small (<\n\u223c3%) in the quenched case but have not yet been measured in the dynamical case.\n\nThe computation of leptonic decay constants\nfor heavy-light mesons plays a key role in the extraction of CKM matrix elements from experiment and has been a focus of lattice QCD calculations for many years. Here, we report on the\nfirst attempt to compute such decay constants in\nthe presence of NF = 3 light sea quarks (u, d,\ns). For the generation of the dynamical lattices,\nwe use the \"Asqtad\" action [1], which consists of\norder \u03b1s a2 , a4 improved staggered quarks and order \u03b12s a2 , a4 Symanzik improved glue [2,3]. This\naction has small discretization errors for many\nquantities [4,5]. For the valence quarks, we employ a tadpole-improved (Landau link) clover action and the Fermilab formalism [6]. The analysis\nis done in a \"partially quenched\" manner: the valence quark masses are extrapolated to their physical values with the sea quark masses held fixed.\nThe chiral extrapolation of the sea quark masses\n(at fixed lattice spacing) is performed afterwards.\n\u2217 presented\n\nby C. Bernard\n\nTable 1 shows the parameters of our lattices\nand the current state of this project. As we decrease the dynamical quark masses from large\nvalues in the three-flavor case, we keep the\nthree masses degenerate until the physical strange\nquark mass is reached. We then keep the strange\nquark mass fixed as we further decrease mu,d .\nConfigurations with varying dynamical quark\nmass (including quenched and two-flavor configurations) have been matched in lattice spacing using the quantity r1 [5], which is defined from the\nstatic quark potential at shorter distance than r0\n[7]. From the value r0 \u2248 0.5 fm we have found\nr1 \u2248 0.35 fm [8] in full QCD. Note that the errors in these phenomenological values may be as\nlarge as 10% [7]; we therefore prefer to use m\u03c1 in\nsetting the absolute scale. Details of the lattice\ngeneration and light quark results are in Ref. [8].\nOur analysis of heavy-light decay constants follows Refs. [9,10]; we describe only the important\ndifferences below.\nOn all lattice sets, we compute quark propaga-\n\n\f2\nTable 1\nStatus of heavy-light running.

This gives\ngood control over both chiral and heavy quark\ninterpolations/extrapolations. In Ref. [9], with 3\nlight quark masses, the chiral extrapolation was\na major source of systematic error. Here, changing from linear to quadratic chiral fits of decay\nconstants changes the results by <\n\u223c2%.\nThe (tadpole improved) perturbative renormaltad\nization of the heavy-light axial current, ZA\n, has\nnot yet been calculated. At present, we therefore\nproceed as follows at a \u2248 0.13 fm:\n(1) Define boosted coupling \u03b1P\ns from the plaquette following Refs. [3,11], and then define the\ntad\n1-loop coefficient \u03b6A by ZA\n= 1 + \u03b1P\ns \u03b6A .\n(2) Fix the scale from m\u03c1 on each set, with\nvalence quarks extrapolated to physical values.\n(3) Fix \u03b6A by demanding that fBquench = 169\nMeV (the MILC continuum-extrapolated result\ntad\n[12]). This gives ZA\non all the 0.13 fm lattices,\nsince \u03b6A is independent of the number of dynamical flavors.\nNote that \u03b6A is dependent on the heavy quark\nmass through the dimensionless quantity am. To\ntest scaling we first repeat the above procedure\n\nfor fD at 0.13 fm and then interpolate to the correct quark mass for fB at 0.09 fm. There is a 2%\nchange in \u03b6A for fB between the two lattice spacings. Because this change results in only a 0.3%\neffect on fB , we believe that systematic effects in\nthe procedure are negligible.\nNote also that comparisons of fB with fBquench\nor changes of fB with a are only very weakly dependent on our assumption about the continuum\nvalue of fBquench. Further, the ratio fBs /fB is essentially independent of perturbation theory.\nIn the plots below, we show two sets of errors.\nThe smaller ones represent the statistical errors\nfrom the fits, computed by jackknife. We use the\nsame fitting ranges in time for all lattices with\nthe same spacing. The larger error bars take into\naccount variations caused by changing the fitting\nranges while keeping confidence levels and statistical errors reasonable.\nPreliminary data for fB with the scale set by\nm\u03c1 is shown in Fig. 1. There is clear evidence for\nan increase in fB as the dynamical quark mass is\ndecreased. There is also an increase in the NF = 3\nresults over those with NF = 2. Note that the\nquenched results at the two lattice spacings are\nconsistent; they differ by <\n\u223c3%.\n\nFigure 1. fB versus (m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 )2 of the dynamical\nlight quarks. The scale is set by m\u03c1 , with valence\nquarks extrapolated to the physical point.\nFigure 2 shows fB with the scale set by r1 =\n0.35 fm (the phenomenological error in this value\nof r1 is not included). There is now little if any\n\n\f3\ndependence on the dynamical quark mass: Holding r1 fixed forces the short distance potentials to\nmatch quite closely, which in turn keeps fB , the\n\"wave function at the origin,\" more or less fixed.\nIn the physical case (three dynamical quarks extrapolated to physical masses) the values of fB in\nFigs. 1 and 2 are consistent.\n\nference in our quenched results at 0.13 fm and\n0.09 fm. With this assumption (which will be\ntested in the coming year) we arrive at the following preliminary results: fB /fBquench = 1.23(4)(6)\nand fBs /fB = 1.18(1)(+4\n\u22121 ), where the first error\nis statistical and the second is systematic, including discretization and chiral extrapolation (valence and dynamical) errors, the uncertainties in\n\u03bas (for fBs /fB ), and a rough estimate of perturbative errors. A direct determination of fB itself\nwith three dynamical flavors must await the calculation of the renormalization factors.\nWe thank NPACI, The Alliance, PSC, NERSC,\nLANL, Indiana University, and Washington University (CSPC) for computing resources.

No obvious dependence on the number or masses of dynamical quarks is apparent. We therefore fit all\nthe data to a constant.\n\nFigure 3.
