INTRODUCTION\n\nTwo competing scenarios are challenged by observations\nto describe the formation of rich clusters and of high-mass\nstars: a quasi-static evolution (also known as core accretion\nmodel) versus a highly dynamical model. The first one is a\nturbulence regulated scenario, where a high level of microturbulence acts as an effective additional thermal pressure to\nbalance gravity (e.g. McKee & Tan 2002). In the second\none, massive cores form and evolve via highly dynamical processes (e.g. Bonnell & Bate 2006; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n2007; Heitsch et al. 2008; Hennebelle et al. 2008; Klessen &\nHennebelle 2010), where convergent flows driven by largescale turbulence, gravity and Galactic motions create dense\nstructures down to small scales by shock-dissipation at their\nstagnation points (e.g. Field et al. 2008; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni\net al. 2011).\nIn the Cygnus X region a population of massive dense cores\n(hereafter MDCs) was revealed by a systematic dust continuum survey (Motte et al. 2007). The most massive of them\nare the birth place of high-mass stars (Bontemps et al. 2010).\nctimea@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de\n\nAmong the MDCs more massive than 40 M all show star formation activity, leading to the suggestion that the formation of\nhigh-mass stars within MDCs is a fast process (Motte et al.\n2007). Csengeri et al. (2011) indeed recognized the important\nrole of dynamical processes inside the young IR-quiet MDCs\nwith crossing times only slightly larger than the local free-fall\ntimes, confirming a fast evolution. The precise origin of the\nMDCs and of their prime properties (mass, size, spatial distribution) is still uncertain as well as one needs to understand\nhow a rich cluster can be formed from relatively small MDCs\n(see discussion in Bontemps et al. 2010). Csengeri et al.\n(2011) also proposed that the massive protostars in the MDCs\nare found at the location of velocity shears by the convergence\nof small scale flows. The existence of these convergent flows\nneeds however confirmation by, for instance, the direct detection of the associated low-velocity shocks (e.g. Klessen et al.\n2005).\nThe clump associated with DR21(OH) is the most massive\n1 pc-scale clump of the whole Cygnus X region. It is embedded in the DR21 filament which contains as much as 30 % of\nthe total mass in dense gas imaged by Motte et al. (2007) (see\nalso Schneider et al. 2010), and contains three 0.1 pc-scale\n\n\f2\n\nT. Csengeri et al.\n\nMDCs: CygX-N44, CygX-N48, and CygX-N38. CygX-N44\nhosts several spots of OH, H2 O maser emission (Plambeck\n& Menten 1990; Liechti & Walmsley 1997) and at high\nangular-resolution two strong peaks of continuum emission\nwere identified (Woody et al. 1989; Mangum et al. 1991)\n(MM1 and MM2 in Fig 1). The brightest peak, MM1, contains a \"hot-core\" (T>100 K) and shows cm continuum emission (Mangum et al. 1991) suggesting the recent birth of\nhigh-mass star(s). CygX-N48 and CygX-N38 have no mid-IR\nemission and host cold gas (T<40 K) (Mangum et al. 1992).\nWith such a high mass, the DR21(OH) clump qualifies as\nthe best target in nearby regions (at less than 3 kpc)1 to probe\nthe initial conditions of a rich and massive protocluster. It is\nexpected to form a cluster as rich or even richer than the Orion\nNebula Cluster2 . We mapped DR21(OH) at high-angular resolution at 3 mm continuum, and in the N2 H+ (J=1\u22120), and\nCH3 CN (J=5\u22124) molecular lines with the PdBI to trace the\ncold, dense gas and warm gas with complex chemistry, respectively.\n2. OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nA mosaic with 3 pointings was obtained with the IRAM3\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) with 6 antennas in Bq\nand Cq configurations between December 2008 and March\n2009. Baselines range from 24 to 452 meters and Tsys was\n\u223c100-150 and 60-80 Kelvins for the B and C tracks, respectively. The signal was correlated at 93.17613 and 91.98705\nGHz in order to obtain the N2 H+ (J=1\u20130) and CH3 CN (J=5\u2013\n4, K=0\u20134) lines respectively, with a velocity resolution of\n\u223c0.25 km s\u22121 . Line-free continuum emission was obtained\nwith 6 broad band correlator units. We used as phase calibrator the bright nearby quasar 2013+370 and as flux calibrator\nthe bright evolved star MWC 349.\nWe used the GILDAS software4 for the data reduction\nand analysis and applied the same method for all datasets.\nZero-spacing information was available only for the N2 H+\n(J=1\u20130) transition (Schneider et al. 2010) and was combined\nwith the interferometric data following standard procedures\nin GILDAS. 5 The image was restored with a natural beam\nweighting in order to favor sensitivity. Clean components\nwere searched for within a polygon, which excluded the borders of the mosaic with a higher noise level. The cleaning\nprocedure was done with the Hogbom algorithm and components were searched down to 3\u03c3 per channel noise level. The\nresulting parameters are shown in Table 1. As a default in\nmosaic mode, the resulting clean maps are corrected for beam\nattenuation.\n3. N2 H+ AS TRACER OF THE COLD, YOUNG GAS\n\nN2 H+ is a tracer of cold, dense gas (Tafalla et al. 2002).\nSince it is quickly destroyed in the heated envelopes of protostars, it shall represent the starless/unprocessed gas, which has\neither not yet fragmented or originates from recently formed\npre/protostellar cores.\n1\n\nWe adopt a distance of 1.7 kpc (Schneider et al. 2006).\nAssuming a star formation efficiency of 30 %, the \u223c7000 M of\nDR21(OH) would produce a stellar mass of 2100 M which is more than\ntwice the stellar masses in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Hillenbrand 1997).\n3 IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN\n(Spain).\n4 See http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/\n5 We exploit here both the combined and the interferometric-only dataset\nof the N2 H+ data, because the latter one filters out extended emission from\nthe clump and shows the compact emission, which is the main focus of this\npaper.\n2\n\nIn a quasi-static view of star formation, the pre-collapse\ncore traced by N2 H+ is expected to evolve to a higher level\nof concentration by a progressive loss of support until it gets\ngravitationally unstable and collapses. In nearby low-mass\nstar-forming regions such as \u03c1 Ophiuchi, N2 H+ is indeed\nfound to show single, narrow lines which are consistent with\nbeing close to or under gravitational collapse with only a\nsmall contribution from non-thermal motions (Andr\u00e9 et al.\n2007).\n3.1. Compact N2 H+ emission is concentrated in the MDCs\n\nIn Fig. 1 a the spatial distribution of N2 H+ at low (IRAM\n30m) and high (PdBI) spatial resolution is compared with the\ndust continuum emission which is taken as a reference to trace\nthe total column density.\nSeen with a single-dish telescope the distribution of N2 H+\ndiffers from the dust continuum (Fig. 1a), as N2 H+ peaks in\nthe south of the clump between CygX-N48 and CygX-N38.\nThis prominent north-south inhomogeneity indicates that generally the southern part of the clump is younger than the northern part. At high spatial resolution with the PdBI (Fig. 1b),\nthe compact emission of N2 H+ is clearly concentrated in the 3\nknown MDCs, CygX-N48, CygX-N38, and CygX-N44. This\ndiscrepancy of the distribution of N2 H+ seen with the singledish telescope compared to the interferometer shows that a\nlarge fraction of the N2 H+ emission originates from extended\nstructures that are filtered out by the interferometer. It also\nshows that the most compact components of N2 H+ , and therefore the densest parts of this unprocessed, cold gas are associated with the MDCs in the clump.\nAt high angular-resolution this spatial coincidence between\nthe dust and N2 H+ and the fact that both tracers seem to form\nstructures at similar size scales of \u223c0.1 pc further confirms\nthe existence of a typical size-scale for MDCs and indicates\nthat the MDCs are the main sites of present star-formation.\nIn contrast, the hot-core region of DR21(OH)-MM1 is devoid of N2 H+ suggesting that star formation there is in a later\nstage. A new, rather compact N2 H+ core is seen north of\nCygX-N38 (Fig. 1b). This new structure coincides with very\nweak (\u223c1.3 mJy/beam peak intensity) continuum emission\nand could either be a fluctuation in the global diffuse N2 H+\ngas, or could correspond to a new MDC in formation.\n3.2. Bulk motions in the N2 H+ gas associated with the MDCs\n\nAt low angular-resolution with the IRAM 30m telescope\nthe spectra show a single component (Schneider et al. 2010),\nsuch as in \u03c1 Ophiuchi, but with a large velocity dispersion of\n\u223c1.3 km s\u22121 . But while in \u03c1 Ophiuchi the line stays single at\nsmall scales (Di Francesco et al. 2004), the N2 H+ emission\nseen with the interferometer clearly splits here into individual\nvelocity components (Fig. 2).\nThis is a striking feature and an important difference to\nlow-mass star-forming regions. Since we could include the\nzero-spacing information from the IRAM 30m telescope, we\nare confident that there are no strong side-lobes and filtering\nwhich could modify the line profiles. Moreover, it seems that\nit is towards the MDCs that the individual velocity components can be recognized the best (see Fig. 2a).\nWe show in Fig. 3 the maps of integrated intensity of the\ntwo velocity components which are associated with the two\ncoldest MDCs, as well as position-velocity cuts through and\nacross the intersection regions between the two velocity components. These cuts show velocity jumps indicated by arrows\n\n\fConvergent flows and low-velocity shocks in DR21(OH)\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- a) Color scale shows the integrated intensity map of the N2 H+ (J=1\u20130) line obtained by Schneider et al. (2010) with the IRAM 30m telescope\n(integration range is between \u221210 to +0.5 km s\u22121 ). White contours indicate the 20% level of the peak increasing by 10%.

(For a color figure see the online edition.)\n\nwhich have relative velocity difference of 2 \u2212 3 km s\u22121 and\nare referred below as velocity shears. We note that the intersection regions of the velocity shears are close to the strongest\npeaks of continuum emission, but do not coincide exactly with\nthem. The velocity shears are found offseted from the strong\ncontinuum sources. These N2 H+ velocity patterns are very\nsimilar to what we have recently obtained using H13 CO+ in\nisolated MDCs in Cygnus X (Csengeri et al. 2011). Similarly, we propose that the individual velocity components seen\nin N2 H+ are also best interpreted as flows converging to the\ngravitational well of MDCs. These flows may carry a significant amount of angular momentum which could lead to\nrotational motions. For a 200 M core the Keplerian velocity\nat 0.1 pc is \u223c2.9 km s\u22121 which is at a similar order as the gradient observed in velocity field. On the other hand the pv-cuts\nin Fig. 3 show that the maximum velocities are not found at\nlarge offsets from the velocity jumps similarly to what is expected in a Keplerian rotation, but they show a more complex\ndistribution. The observed velocity pattern of the gas here is\nthus not compatible with a pure rotation of the cores. Furthermore an homogeneous sphere in rotation would also not show\nseparated individual velocity components.\nIt is surprising to see these flows in N2 H+ , since it normally\ntraces only pre-stellar cores which are gravitationally bound\nstructures. On the other hand, it may just indicate that the prestellar gas is already dense and cold in the convergent flows\nwhich then form the even higher density structures at the center of the MDCs. Furthermore we note that the observed range\nof velocity (between \u22126.5 and +0.5 km s\u22121 over the whole\nclump) is larger than in Csengeri et al. (2011) most probably because of the larger mass and gravitational well of the\nDR21(OH) clump.\n\n3.3. On the origin of the clump fragmentation into MDCs\n\nIf the \u223c7000 M DR21(OH) clump would be governed\nonly by thermal motions and gravity, it would fragment into\na large population of \u223c0.4 M fragments corresponding to\n\nthe local Jeans-mass6 which should concentrate in the central regions close to the gravitational center of the clump. Instead, the distribution of dense gas traced by N2 H+ mostly\nreveals three centers of collapse, the MDCs. It is then not\nclear why the large scale, gravitationally driven flows split to\npredominately form a few MDCs dispersed over the clump.\nOn the other hand, the observed hierarchical fragmentation\nis very similar to what is obtained in numerical simulations\n(e.g. Hennebelle et al. 2011). These models indicate that fragmentation is provoked by a complex interplay between gravity, rotation, thermal/turbulent pressure and magnetic forces\n(V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2007) which may make it difficult\nto clearly pinpoint the physical origin of the observed fragmentation properties.\n3.4. Are MDCs living for more than a crossing time?\n\nSince the gas dynamics dominate the evolution of the\nMDCs, the crossing times7 of the MDCs, ranging from 5 to\n7 \u00d7 104 yr, should measure the life-time of the presently observed dense gas. On the other hand the large scale flows\nobserved by Schneider et al. (2010) are massive enough to\ncontinuously replenish the mass of the MDCs keeping them\n'active' for a longer period if the local gravitational wells are\nspatially stable. The presence of still active N2 H+ convergent\nflows at the location of each MDC favors this view of stable\ngravitational wells over time and thus suggests that the MDCs\nare re-filled (by large-scale flows) over longer times.\nIt is also striking to see that all three MDCs are situated\nclose to embedded IR-bright sources likely excited by embedded massive stars (see Fig. 5). This reveals the presence\nof a population of young stars which could have been formed\nat earlier time inside the same three MDCs.\n6 The Jeans-mass is calculated here for n \u223c 1.3\u00d7105 cm\u22123 , and T =\n20 K (Motte et al. 2007)\n7 Since the crossing-times are almost equal to the local free-fall times\nwhich are \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 yr, it re-inforces the view by which self-gravity is the\nmain driver of the observed dynamics (the whole DR21 filament is in global\ncollapse).\n\n\f4\n\nT.

Intriguing extended CH3 CN emission in all MDCs\n\nA map of integrated CH3 CN emission over all K=0-4 components is shown in Fig. 1 d. CH3 CN has long been considered to be produced only in hot cores and hot corinos (e.g.\nKurtz et al. 2000; Bottinelli et al. 2004) as a second generation molecule formed in the gas phase after ice sublimation\nresulting in very compact emission towards protostars. As\nexpected, a bright, compact peak of CH3 CN emission is centered on the hot core source MM1 (Fig. 1 d). Among the other\ncontinuum sources, we do not detect any similar strong and\ncompact CH3 CN emission which would indicate hot cores.\nIn addition to the compact emission of MM1, widespread\nextended emission of CH3 CN is detected towards all MDCs of\nthe region, including the colder ones, CygX-N38, CygX-N48.\nThis extended emission is associated with the MDCs but is in\ndetail almost entirely anti-correlated with the dust continuum\n(Fig. 3b and e). In CygX-N48, it forms an elongated structure\nalmost perpendicular to the dust emission. In CygX-N38, it\nis shifted by 500 from the dust continuum. This indicates that\nCH3 CN has to be over-abundant in the gas (in comparison\nwith the bulk of gas traced by the continuum) to explain this\nparticular spatial distribution.\n4.2. Is CH3 CN tracing shocks of the convergent flows?\nIn Fig. 3b and e, the two main N2 H+ velocity components\nare overlaid on the CH3 CN emission. CH3 CN seems to be\nbright at the location of the velocity shears (interfaces between the red and blue velocity components) discussed in\nSect. 3.2, and which we interpret as tracing N2 H+ convergent\nflows. It is striking that CH3 CN coincides much better with\nthese velocity shears than with the dust continuum. Therefore\nwe suggest that CH3 CN could trace warm gas associated with\nthe shocks expected at the convergence of the flows.\n\nCH3 CN has actually been detected towards a young protostellar outflow shock in L1157 (Codella et al. 2009).\nThe abundance of CH3 CN can have significant contribution\nfrom grain surface chemistry (Garrod et al. 2008) producing CH3 CN directly on ices. A higher CH3 CN abundance\ncould originate in warm gas from ice sublimation. The involved velocities are however here smaller than in outflows, 2\nto 3 km s\u22121 in projection which converts to 3.7 to 5.5 km s\u22121\nif corrected for an average projection angle8 . From Fig. 3 in\nKaufman & Neufeld (1996) we see that the resulting postshock gas temperature could be close to 100 K for a magnetized C-shock. At this gas temperature, the grains stay however cold and ice sublimation is not expected (Draine et al.\n1983). Partial desorption has however been recently proposed\nto explain gas phase abundance of complex molecules (Garrod et al. 2007; Arce et al. 2008; \u00d6berg et al. 2009). The\nhigher gas temperature and sputtering of grain mantle in the\nshock may have led to an increased desorption of CH3 CN\nwhich could explain the detectable abundance of CH3 CN in\nthe gas phase which is otherwise virtually not present in the\ncold, dense gas.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIt is striking that N2 H+ , a classical tracer of cold, dense gas,\nshows flows associated with the highest density regions forming new high-mass stars. These flows are showing velocity\nshears which are found to spatially coincide with intriguing\nextended CH3 CN emission.\nThe evolution of the MDCs is driven by supersonic flows\nwhich are able to continuously supply a replenishment of material thanks to large scale flows (see Schneider et al. 2010)\nwhile the MDCs form stars. As a consequence, they main8 The true post-shock velocities could be higher if the flows accelerate in\nthe gravitational potential of the MDCs.\n\n\fConvergent flows and low-velocity shocks in DR21(OH)\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- a) Zoom into the CygX-N48 MDC.
