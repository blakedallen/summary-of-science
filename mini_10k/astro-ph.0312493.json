In the high/soft state, typically seen\nat luminosities above \u223c 5 \u2212 10 per cent of Eddington, the\nenergy spectrum is dominated by a soft thermal component\nof temperature 0.4\u2013 1.5 keV. This is well described by the\nstandard accretion model of emission from an optically thick\nand geometrically thin disc (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, hereafter SS73). Where the source varies, the temperature and\nluminosity of this disc component change together in such\na way as to indicate that the size of the emitting structure\nremains approximately constant i.e. L \u221d T 4 (Ebisawa et al.\n1991; 1994; Kubota, Makishima & Ebisawa 2001; Kubota &\nMakishima 2004; hereafter KM04; Gierlinski & Done 2004;\nhereafter GD04). Excitingly, this gives an observable diagnostic of the mass and spin of the black hole, assuming that\nthis constant size scale is set by the innermost stable orbit\naround the black hole.\nThese results are actually very surprising in the context of the SS73 disc equations. The predicted disc structure\nis violently unstable at such luminosities, where radiation\npressure dominates, yet these disc dominated spectra show\nvery little short time-scale variability. Also, the disc spectrum should not be a simple sum of blackbody spectra at\nc 0000 RAS\n\nthese high temperatures, as electron scattering dominates\nover true absorption. In the X-ray band, this difference in\nspectral shape can be roughly described as a standard disc\nspectrum, but of a higher temperature than the effective\n(blackbody) temperature (Shimura & Takahara 1995; Merloni et al. 2000). However, this colour temperature correction factor can change with luminosity, so is not predicted\nto produce a simple L \u221d T 4 relation (GD04).\nReal discs are then observed to be much simpler than\nthe SS73 predictions, pointing to the inadequacies of the ad\nhoc \u03b1 viscosity prescription and motivating further studies\nof the disc structure which results from the physical (magnetic dynamo) viscosity mechanism in radiative discs (e.g.\nTurner 2004). This observed simplicity is reserved only for\nthe high/soft state data, where the disc spectrum is dominant. Accreting black holes can also show a rather different type of spectrum at high luminosities, the so-called very\nhigh state termed the steep power-law state by MR03), characterized by a very strong (roughly) power-law component\n(Miyamoto et al. 1991). This is normally steep, with photon spectral index \u0393 > 2.2, rather different to the standard\nlow/hard state spectra seen usually at much lower luminosities (e.g. the reviews by Tanaka & Lewin 1995; MR03). In\nthis very high state, the constant area inferred from the\nrelation between observed temperature and disc luminosity breaks down (Ebisawa et al. 1994; Kubota et al. 2001;\nKM04; MR03).\n\n\f2\n\nAya Kubota, Chris Done\n\nTo some extent this breakdown is expected. The strong\nhigh energy emission shows that a large fraction of the\naccretion energy is dissipated in some non-disc structure\n(corona/jet?), so the disc structure should be different to\nthat seen when the emission is dominated by the thermal\ndisc spectrum (e.g. Svensson & Zdziarski 1994). Also, the\nintense X-rays may illuminate the disc, again changing its\nstructure (e.g. Nayakshin, Kazanas & Kallman 2000). However, Kubota et al (2001) showed that for very high state\nspectra where the high energy emission was less than \u223c 50\nper cent of the total flux (which they termed the anomalous\nspectra), then the constancy of disc area could be (approximately) recovered by careful modelling of the spectrum,\nand by correcting the observed disc luminosity to include\nthe Compton scattered photons (KM04).\nHere we investigate the extremely Comptonised very\nhigh state spectra from the 1998 outburst of XTE J1550-564,\nwhere the steep power law tail dominates the total emission.\nThis source has a superluminal jet (Hannikainen et al. 2001)\nand is a confirmed black hole with mass of 8.4\u201311.2 M\u2299 , at a\ndistance of 5 kpc and binary inclination angle of 70\u25e6 (Orosz\net al. 2002).\nWe show that these extremely Comptonised very high\nspectra are qualitatively and quantitatively different to the\nspectra with a weaker Comptonised tail. They are not easily\ncompatible with a simple Comptonising corona above an\nuntruncated disc, though such a geometry may be possible\nwith a complex corona, with strong radial gradients in the\noptical depth. However, the simplest solution is that the disc\nin these Compton dominated spectra is truncated at larger\nradii than the minimum stable orbit around the black hole.\n\n2\n\nSPECTRAL EVOLUTION OF XTE J1550 \u2212 564\nIN THE 1998 OUTBURST\n\nThe transient black hole binary XTE J1550 \u2212 564 was discovered on 1998 September 7 by RXTE ASM (Smith 1998)\nand CGRO BATSE (Wilson et al. 1998). This source showed\nfour subsequent outbursts since its discovery, but the first\noutburst was the brightest and best covered by RXTE pointing observations. The data were analyzed by many authors\nincluding Sobczak et al. (1999; 2000ab), Wilson & Done\n(2001), Homan et al. (2001), and KM04.\nFigure 1 shows the 1.5\u201312 keV light curve and hardness\nratios of the first outburst, obtained with RXTE ASM, together with the frequency of the main QPO (where seen)\nfrom Remillard et al. (2002). Clearly the source hardness\nchanges dramatically during the outburst, as does the QPO\nfrequency. These are generally correlated, so that spectral\nstates can be defined either from spectral or power spectral\ncharacteristics (van der Klis 2000; MR03).\nHere we briefly summerise the main features of the\nsource behaviour. The marked softening of the spectrum in\nthe first 5-10 days after the source was detected is associated\nwith a state transition from the low/hard state (first five\ndays) into the very high state (Wilson & Done 2000; Cui et\nal. 1999; Sobczak et al. 1999). For about a month (between\ndays 5\u201352: Fig. 1), the source showed strong QPOs and a\nstrong hard spectral component (e.g., Sobczak et al. 2000a),\nso can be classified as in the very high state during the whole\nof this time. The QPO frequency changes quite dramatically\n\nFigure 1. The RXTE ASM light curves of XTE J1550\u2212564. The\ntop panel shows the 1.5\u201312 keV ASM count rate, while the middle\npanel shows the ASM hardness ratio (5\u201312 keV/3\u20135 keV). The\nbottom panel shows the high (open circles) and low (filled circles)\nfrequency QPOs, taken from Remillard et al. (2002). Harmonics\nof the low frequency QPOs, reported by Remillard et al. (2002),\nare not shown here. The times of the simultaneous ASCA/RXTE\nobservations are indicated with down-arrows in the top panel,\nwhile up-arrows indicate the times of the spectra shown in Fig. 2.\nVertical solid lines show days 5, 43, and 225 since the beginning\nof the outburst, and the vertical dashed line indicates the position of the outburst peak. Data points with blue, magenta, and\norange correspond to the anomalous regime (or weak very high\nstate in text), standard regime, and apparently standard regime\ndefined by KM04, respectively. Green data points correspond to\nthe strong very high state which is introduced in this paper.\n\nduring the first \u223c 40 days of the outburst, but then stabilizes from day 40-52. The type of QPO also changes at day\n40 (from C/C' to B: see Remillard et al. 2002).\nAfter the day 52, the luminosity and hardness both\ndecreased as the source made a transition to the classic high/soft disc dominated (termed thermal dominated:\nMR03) state. Generally the QPO is not seen, but when it\nis detected, it is of different type (A, very weak: Remillard\net al. 2002) to that seen previously. Most of the time until the end of this first outburst, the source stayed in this\ndisc dominated high/soft state as the luminosity changed,\ngiving progressively higher/lower disc temperatures and so\nhigher/lower hardness ratios. There is just one section (days\n180-200) where the hard power law flux again increased relative to the disc emission to a level comparable to that seen\ntowards the end of the first very high state (days 40-52) and\nwhere the QPOs (mainly type B) reappear. Hence Homan\net al. (2001) identify these data as very high state.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fVery High State Geometry\n\nFigure 2. Typical PCA and HEXTE spectra of XTE J1550\u2212564\ntaken from times as indicated in Fig. 1. The data is unfolded with\nthe best fit model fit to the PCA+HEXTE data (see \u00a74.2).\n\nThe luminosity and temperature of the disc component\nfrom day 40 onwards is always consistent with optically thick\nmaterial extending down to the last stable orbit around the\nblack hole (KM04, see also Figs 4b-d). In this paper, we\nconcentrate our discussion on the very high state spectra\nwhere the coronal luminosity is > 50% of the total i.e. days\n5\u201340 of the outburst. We will show that these data are most\neasily described if the inner disc does NOT extend down to\nthe last stable orbit, as also indicated by the QPO frequency.\nHereafter, we distinguish these data from the other very high\nstates in which the power law component is weaker (days\n40\u201352, 180\u2013200), and call it the \"strong very high state\". In\nTable 1, we summarize the correspondence of the spectral\nstates we used in this paper to the state defined in other\nliteratures.\n\n3\n\nDATA REDUCTION\n\nWe used all the data from the first outburst except for the\nfirst 5 days where the source is in the low/hard state. Good\nPCA and HEXTE data were selected and processed, following the same procedures as in KM04 and WD01, respectively.\nFor the PCA data reduction we used top and mid\nlayer from all available units, using standard exclusion criteria (target elevation less than 10\u25e6 above the Earth's limb,\npointing direction was more than 1\u2032.2 from the target, data\nacquired within 30 minutes after the spacecraft passage\nthrough South Atlantic Anomaly). The standard dead time\ncorrection procedure was applied to the data. The PCA\nbackground was estimated for each observation, using the\nsoftware package pcabackest (version 2.1e), supplied by the\nRXTE Guest Observer's Facility at NASA/GSFC. The PCA\nresponse matrix was made for each observation by utilizing the latest version (8.0) of the software package pcarsp.\nIn order to take into account the calibration uncertainties,\n0.5% systematic errors are added to each bin of the PCA\nspectra. A more conservative 1% systematic error does not\nqualitatively change the results, but gives very small values\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nof \u03c72 /dof. The 3\u201320 keV data are used in this paper, since\nthere is sometimes residual structure in the 20\u201335 keV range\nassociated with the Xe-K edge at \u223c30 keV.\nThe HEXTE consists of two independent clusters (Cluster 0 and 1) of four NaI(Tl)/CsI(Na) phoswich scintillation\ncounters (Rothschild et al. 1998). The HEXTE data were\nselected in the same way as that of the PCA. Since one\ndetector on Cluster 1 of the HEXTE has lost its spectral\ncapability, we use only Standard mode data from Cluster\n0. The HEXTE background was subtracted by sequential\nrocking of the two clusters on and off of the source position.\nWe used the software package called hxtback for splitting the\ndata and the background. The HEXTE data below 30 keV\nwere not used in the spectral fit because of response uncertainties associated with the Xe-K edge\u22c6 . Systematic errors\nof 0.5% are also added to each spectral bin of the HEXTE,\nthough these are much smaller than statistical errors of the\nHEXTE data in the range of 30\u2013200 keV so make no difference to the spectral fits. Figure 2 shows the range of spectral\nshapes seen by the PCA and HEXTE data over the course\nof the outburst, taken from days of 13, 17, 36, 46, and 65 as\ndenoted by the up-arrows in Fig. 1.\nASCA observations of this source were performed three\ntimes, on 1998 September 12, 24, and 1999 March 17, as\nindicated with down arrows in Fig. 1. There are simultaneous RXTE observations corresponding to each ASCA observation. The first simultaneous observation was just on the\nboundary of the low and very high state, while the third one\nwas in the weak very high state (days 180-200). In this paper\nwe are most interested in the strong very high state, so we\nchoose to use only the second ASCA observation. The ASCA\nGIS events were extracted from a circular region of 6\u2032 radius\ncentered on the image peak, after selecting good time intervals in a standard procedure. A net exposure of 2.4 ks was\nobtained for this simultaneous pointing. Dead time fractions\nare determined from count rate monitor data (Makishima et\nal. 1996) as 85.6% for GIS2 and 87.3% for GIS3. Systematic\nerrors of 1% are added to each spectral bin. We only use the\nGIS data since the SIS is strongly affected by pileup.\nThe well known difference in calibration between the\nGIS and the PCA has been fixed in the PCA response matrices in HEASOFT 5.2. Thus the data are fitted simultaneously in this paper.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nANALYSES OF THE MULTIPLE RXTE DATA\nSimple fits to the PCA data\n\nIn order to briefly characterize the spectral behavior\nthroughout the outburst, we performed spectral fitting to\nthe 3\u201320 keV PCA data with the canonical multicolour disc\nmodel (hereafter MCD model, diskbb in XSPEC; Mitsuda\net al. 1984) plus a power-law model. The power-law component is modified by an absorption edge around 7\u20139 keV\ndescribed by a smeared edge model (smedge in XSPEC;\nEbisawa et al. 1994), and a narrow Gaussian is also added\nfor the Fe-K line by constraining its central energy in the\nrange 6.2\u20136.9 keV.

Figure 3 shows the\nevolution of the spectral parameters as a function of time (as\nin Fig. 2 of KM04 but including the strong very high state\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fVery High State Geometry\ndata of the first 5\u201340 days as well). Panel (a) shows the bolometric luminosity of the disc, Ldisk , 1\u2013100 keV power law\nluminosity, Lpow and total Ltot \u2261 Ldisk + Lpow . Here, Ldisk\nis calculated by referring to two parameters of the MCD\nmodel, inner disc temperature Tin (panel b) and an appar2\n4\nent inner disc radius rin (panel c), as Ldisk = 4\u03c0rin\n\u03c3Tin\n.\nFigure 4a plots the derived disc luminosity against inner\n4\ndisc temperature for these fits. Clearly, Ldisk \u221d Tin\nin the\nstandard high/soft state (magenta filled circles), indicating\na constant area emitting region. Only the very lowest luminosity points deviate from this line, but the errors on these\nare fairly large as the low temperature disc is rather poorly\ncovered by the PCA bandpass. When we fit these data points\nwith a power-law, we obtain an index of 3.9+0.1\n\u22120.2 with a normalization at Tin = 1 keV of Ldisk = 3.55 \u00b1 0.08 erg s\u22121 .\nIt is very tempting to identify the source of this markedly\nconstant behaviour with the constant area defined by a disc\nextending down to the innermost stable orbit. When the\napparent inner disc radius of rin = 53 km derived from the\nfits is corrected for the stress\u2013free inner boundary condition\n(Kubota et al. 1998) and colour temperature correction of\n1.7 then this gives an estimate for the true inner disc radius\nof Rin = 63 km with a typical error of 10 %. This value\nis slightly smaller than 75\u2013100 km, which is the innermost\nstable orbit for a non-spinning black hole of 8.4\u201311.2 M\u2299 .\nTherefore, XTE J1550 \u2212 564 is consistent with a moderately rotating black hole, while uncertainties of the source\ndistance and determination of \u03ba can cancel this difference.\nThe behaviour of the disc component in the rest of the\ndata is rather different. Fig. 4a shows that the strong very\nhigh state spectra (green open squares, days 5\u201330) have a\nmuch lower temperature disc than expected for the disc luminosity. Conversely the disc in the weak very high states\nhas the disc at somewhat higher temperature than expected\nfrom its luminosity. In other words, the disc inner radius\nof the strong very high state appears at much larger values\nthan that disc dominated regime, while that of the weak very\nhigh state is apparently found at smaller values. Inspection\nof Fig. 3(b)\u2013(c) shows that this change in behaviour happens\naround day 30.\n4.2\n\nFitting with the picture of the strong disc\nComptonisation\n\nThe key characteristic of all the non high/soft state data is\nthat the Comptonised tail is much more important in the\nspectrum (see Fig. 2), so details of how it is modeled become important. A power law approximation for the Comptonised spectrum is inadequate, as real Compton spectra\nshow a low energy turnover close to the seed photon energy\n(KM04; Done, Zycki & Smith 2002). We replace the power\nlaw with a proper thermal Comptonisation model (thcomp\u2020\nin XSPEC: Zdziarski, Johnson & Magdziarz 1996) which\nis parameterized by asymptotic power law index, \u0393thc , and\nelectron temperature, Te . We assume that the seed photons\nare from the observed MCD component, so Te is the only\nadditional free parameter compared to the previous power\nlaw fits.\nWe use the PCA and HEXTE data in order to better\n\u2020 http://www.camk.edu.pl/ \u0303ptz/relrepr.html\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.

(b)\u2013(e)\nThose of Tin , rin , \u0393, and \u03c72 /dof, respectively.\n\nconstrain Te , but this broad bandpass shows that the spectra\nare rather more complex than a single thermal comptonisation component (and its reflected emission). While the data\nbelow 20 keV can be dominated by the disc and a cool thermal Compton component, the higher energy data show a\nquasi-power law tail (Gierlinski et al. 1999; Zdziarski et al.\n2001; WD01; Kubota et al. 2001; Gierlinski & Done 2003;\nKM04). We follow KM04 and model this additional component as a power law with photon index \u0393 fixed at 2.0 which\nis the average index of the high energy emission in the standard high/soft state (e.g. fits to HEXTE data: Sobczak et al.\n2000b), and fit all the PCA+HEXTE data with this three\ncomponent continuum model; MCD plus thermal comptonisation (thcomp) plus power law, with the gaussian line and\nsmeared edge to mimic reflection. All the model parameters\nare constrained to be the same between the PCA and the\nHEXTE data except for a normalization factor.\nThis three component model successfully reproduced\nall the spectra, and the electron temperature of the Comptonised component was found at 10\u201330 keV in all the very\nhigh state data, except for that at the peak (day 13) where\nthe temperature is considerably higher at \u223c 60 keV. This\nmeans that the thermal rollover in the spectrum is not so obvious in the PCA-HEXTE bandpass. Nonetheless, the complex continuum model (thermal plus non-thermal) is still\nstrongly preferred by the data compared to a single Comptonised component. Thus it seems likely that the peak spectrum is simply a more extreme version of the surrounding\nvery high state spectra.

The change in derived disc parameters for spectra shown in Fig. 2 are given in Table 2. The\ndisc temperature increases dramatically for the strong very\nhigh state spectra (days 5\u201330, green open squares), while\nfor the weak very high state spectra (days 40\u201352 shown as\nblue open circles), it is the disc luminosity which increases.\nThe net effect is to pull all the Comptonised spectra much\ncloser to the constant radius behavior seen in the standard\nhigh/soft state (magenta filled circles: Fig. 4b). This looks\nvery promising for models in which the disc structure re-\n\nmains rather stable in all the high state spectra, with constant apparent inner disc radius.\nHowever, the Comptonised luminosity is indeed very\nlarge compared to that of the disc in the very high state,\nmaking it likely that the corona covers a fairly large fraction of the disc. In this case the corona is in the line of\nsight and intercepts some of the disc photons, so the observed disc luminosity underestimates the intrinsic disc luminosity, Lint\ndisk . The energy transfer by Compton scattering\ncan be characterised by the Compton y parameter, which\nis \u223c 4\u03c4 2 kTe /mc2 (e.g., Rybicki & Lightman 1979). If this\nis small then Lint\ndisk is roughly consistent with Ldisk + Lthc\n(Kubota et al. 2001; KM04). Figure 4c shows this luminosity plotted against Tin . As shown by KM04 this puts the\nweak very high state (anomalous regime ; days 40\u201352) data\nonto the same constant radius line as the standard regime\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fVery High State Geometry\n\n7\n\ndata, while the strong very high state lies significantly above\nthese points.\nFor the strong very high state, the Compton energy\nboost is not negligible. Instead, we estimate Lint\ndisk by conservation of photon number, as the photons in the Comptonised\nspectrum came originally from scattering of seed photons\nfrom the disc. Figure 6 shows two simple corona geometries\nfor the very high state, a sphere and a slab, respectively,\nabove an untruncated disc. The intrinsic number of disc phoint\ntons, Ndisk\n= Ndisk + aNthc , where values of a are 2 cos i and\n1, for spherical and slab geometries, respectively (KM04),\nassuming that the seed photons from the disc have the same\ndisc blackbody spectrum as is observed. Thus, the intrinsic\ndisc emission can be estimated by\nLint\ndisk\n\n=\n\nint\nLdisk * Ndisk\n/Ndisk\n\n(1)\n\n=\n\nint\nbTin * Ndisk\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the value of b is defined as bTin Ndisk = Ldisk , and via\nequation (A1) in KM04, it is given as\nb = 1.31 \u00d7 10\u22129 *\n\n2\u03c0D2\ncos i\n\nerg keV\u22121 photons\u22121 cm2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nfor the bolometric (0.01\u2013100 keV) photon fluxes, Ndisk and\nNthc .\nFigure 4d shows this estimate for Lint\ndisk (calculated for a\nspherical geometry) plotted against Tin , while Fig. 5c shows\nthe conversion of Lint\ndisk into apparent inner disc radius. It is\nclear that the weak very high state (anomalous regime) data\nare now easily consistent with the same constant rin seen in\nthe standard high/soft data, but the strong very high state,\nwhere the Comptonised luminosity is more than \u223c 50% of\nthe total flux, are well above the line. This is highly unlikely\nto be due to a changing colour temperature correction, as it\nrequires a smaller colour temperature correction than that\nin the standard high/soft state (see \u00a76). Thus either the\ndisc inner radius is increasing, or the corona is much more\ncomplex than modelled here.\n\n5\n\nSIMULTANEOUS ASCA-PCA-HEXTE DATA\n\nOne obvious caveat of the spectral modelling is that the low\ntemperatures inferred for the strong very high state mean\nthat the disc spectrum is not well covered by the PCA bandpass which starts only at \u223c3 keV. Hence we use the simultaneous ASCA GIS data to extend the soft energy response.\nWe use the same three continuum component model and fitting conditions as above, except that the value of NH is now\na free parameter. Same as in \u00a74.2, except for a normalization\nfactor, all the model parameters are constrained to be the\nsame between the GIS, the PCA and the HEXTE data. Table 3 shows the fitting results. Figure 7 shows the raw data\nand the residuals between the data and the model, and Fig. 8\nshows an unfolded spectrum with the model. The model fits\nthe simultaneous data very well with \u03c72 /dof = 150.4/186.\nThe best fit value of Tin = 0.54 \u00b1 0.02 keV is much more\ntightly constrained, and its central value is slightly shifted\nto lower temperature than 0.65+0.08\n\u22120.04 keV derived from the\nRXTE data alone.\nIn order to check the results with a more physical\nmodel, we replace the phenomenological line and smeared\nedge spectral features with the full reflection code included\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 5. Same as Fig. 3, but based on the three component\nmodel fits to the PCA+HEXTE data (\u00a74.2). The data points after\nday 52 are the same as in Fig. 3.

Panels (a) and (c) are based on the\nnormalization factor obtained with the PCA data.\n\nin the thcomp model (Zycki, Done & Smith 1998). We fix\nthe inclination and iron abundance at 70\u25e6 and solar abundance, respectively. These fit results are shown as model (b)\nin Table 3. The derived reflection parameters look somewhat unphysical, with a large amount of mostly neutral reflection. This is probably due to limitations of the reflection\nmodelling for an ionized disc in thcomp, which is based on\nthe pexriv reflected continuum calculations (Magzdiarz &\nZdziarski 1995). These codes calculate the ionisation balance in a very simplistic way (Done et al. 1992), assumming\nit to be constant throughout the disc rather than varying\nas a function of height (Nayakshin et al. 2000; Ballantyne,\nRoss & Fabian 2001).\nAnother issue is that these models assume that Compton upscattering is negligible below 12 keV. However, for\nionised material this can be very important in determining\nthe iron line and edge structure observed (Ross, Fabian &\nYoung 1999).

Schematic pictures of assumed geometries of the\ncorona. Spherical(a) and slab(b) geometries are shown.\n\nare available for spectral fitting (Nayakshin et al. 2000; Ballantyne, Iwasawa & Ross 2001), they assume a very simple\ncontinuum form (power law, or power law with exponential\ncutoff) which means they cannot accurately describe the\ncomplex spectral shape observed in these very high state\ndata. Instead, we estimate the impact of this uncertainty in\nthe reflection modelling by removing the iron line and edge\nregion (5\u201312 keV) and refitting the data with the thcomp\nreflected continuum with an ionization parameter, \u03be, fixed\nat 102 , 103 and 104 , (models (c), (d) and (e) respectively in\nTable 2).\nThe disc luminosities and temperatures derived from\n\nthe series of models (a\u2013e in Table 2) are plotted as filled\nblack squares on the T \u2212 L plots (Fig. 4b\u2013d). These show\nthe range of systematic uncertainties present from the spectral modelling. However, all of the fits detailed in Table 2\nhave an even lower disc temperature than that derived from\nfits to the PCA+HEXTE data, but with a similar luminosity. These show even more clearly that the strongly Comptonised spectra are not easily consistent with an untruncated\ndisc. For the simple corona geometries of Fig. 6, then in\norder to explain the high inferred intrinsic disc luminosity,\n38\nLint\nerg s\u22121 , with the same disc radius as seen\ndisk \u223c 2\u20133\u00d710\nin the standard high/soft state requires Tin > 0.85\u20130.9 keV.\nBy contrast, the 99.9% upper limits (\u03c72 /dof = 1.35 for dof\nof 186\u2013188) of the disc temperature from the ASCA-PCAHEXTE data is < 0.66 keV for all the models (a\u2013e) in Table\n2. Fixing Tin = 0.85 keV results in completely unacceptable\nfits (\u03c72 /dof =4.6\u20135.6).\n\nMore conservatively, even when the systematic errors of\nthe PCA data and the HEXTE data increased to 1 %, the\n99.9 % upper limit is still lower than 0.69 keV. Since deviations between the modeled and measured Crab spectrum\ndo not exceed 1 % as noticed by many authors including\nRevnivtsev et al. (2003), Tin = 0.69 keV can be considered\nas the securest upper limit of the disc inner temperature. It\nis clear that the low disc temperature derived in the strong\nvery high state spectra from the PCA+HEXTE fits are not\ndue to lack of PCA coverage of the disc spectrum, or the\nspectral modelling of the reflection emission.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fVery High State Geometry\n6.1\n\nFigure 7. The simultaneous spectral fit on GIS, PCA and\nHEXTE, with the best fit model predictions.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown that the strong very high state spectra really do have a rather low temperature disc for its luminosity. These observations suggest that the disc is truncated\nat larger radii than the last stable orbit in the strong very\nhigh state. However, this is based on the assumptions that\n(1) the correction factor of color to effective temperature is\nkept approximately constant, and (2) the corona fully covers\nthe disc as illustrated in Fig. 6\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nChange of color temperature correction\n\nFigure 5c represents the time history of the apparent inner\nradius rin , as derived from the temperature and luminosity\nvalues given in Fig. 4d. The true inner radius Rin is related\nto rin as Rin \u221d \u03ba2 rin , where \u03ba is the colour temperature\ncorrection. For constant \u03ba, the observed variability of rin is\njust caused by change of the inner radius. However, a change\nin the colour temperature correction could be expected as\na function of disc luminosity (Merloni et al. 2000; GD04;\nKawaguichi 2003), and illumination of the upper layers of\nthe disc (Nayakshin et al. 2000) and/or conductive heating\ncould also lead to an increase in \u03ba.\nClose inspection of Fig. 4d shows that the data points\ncorresponding to the weak very high state (anomalous\nregime) are slightly lower than the solid line denoting constant rin . Although this is not very significant, it could perhaps indicate a constant radius disc with slightly higher\ncolour temperature correction. Conversely, the disc in the\nstrong very high state requires a decrease in colour temperature correction by a factor of \u223c 60% i.e. \u03ba \u223c 1. This would\nimply that the observed colour temperature was the same as\nthe effective disc temperature, which is only possible when\ntrue absorption opacity dominates over electron scattering.\nThis cannot be the case at the observed \u223c0.5 keV temperatures. Changing \u03ba cannot explain the strong very high state\nspectra with the disc with a constant radius.\nThe above discussion assumed that the disc spectrum\ncan be described by a simple colour temperature correction. Plainly this may not be the case, and the disc spectrum could be completly distorted, for example if the inner disc colour temperature correction were much higher\nthan at outer radii. The spectrum would then look like a\nlow temperature disc with some fraction of the emission at\nmuch higher temperature. This is exactly what these strong\nvery high state spectra look like, so we examine the effect of\nComptonization as a function of radius on the disc spectrum\nbelow.\n\n6.2\n\nFigure 8. Unfolded spectrum of Fig. 7 with the predictions of\nmodel (a).\n\n9\n\nGeometry and energetics of the corona\n\nSo far, we assumed the corona fully covers the disc as illustrated in Fig. 6. However several other geometries can be\nconsidered, as illustrated in Fig. 9. If the corona is out of\nour line of sight to the disc e.g. a small inner region, perhaps physically representing an inner jet or bulk Comptonisation of the infalling material (see Fig. 9a and b), then the\nCompton scattering does not affect the observed disc flux,\nso the correction used above overestimates the intrinsic disc\nemission. The problem of such a geometry is that the Comptonising region would see many fewer disc photons than an\nobserver, in conflict with the data (see Tables 2 and 3). Even\nwithout this problem, the best that such a geometry could\ndo is reduce the estimated intrinsic disc luminosity to that\nobserved (i.e. where none of the disc photons in our line of\nsight are intercepted). This puts us straight back to Fig. 4b,\nwhere the ASCA+PCA+HEXTE data show a much lower\ntemperature disc than expected for its luminosity in the very\nhigh state.\nAlternatively, the corona could be patchy (Fig. 9c), or\ncover only the inner disc (Fig. 9d). In both these geometries the corona is in the line of sight to the disc, so again\n\n\f10\n\nAya Kubota, Chris Done\n\nthis predicts that the Compton scattered photons we see\nare removed from the observed disc emission. The intrinsic\ndisc emission should still be estimated as in Fig. 4d. While\nthe patchy corona could take photons uniformly from the\nwhole disc, the inner corona (Fig. 9d) would preferentially\ntake only the inner disc (highest temperature) photons, perhaps leading to an underestimate of the disc temperature.\nThis is analogous to having a variable colour temperature\ncorrection with radius (see above). We model this by switching the seed photons in thcomp to blackbody (rather than\nthe MCD), and allow the temperatures of the observed inner disc and seed photons to be different. This gives a very\nstrong upper limit on the seed photon temperature for the\nASCA-PCA-HEXTE data of < 0.6 keV, showing that the\nlow disc temperature is not an artifact of the seed photon\ndistribution assumed.\nHowever, the existence of the corona changes the disc\ntemperature structure. In the limit of a corona that covers\nthe whole disc then this has little effect as both the disc luminosity and temperature are reduced (Svensson & Zdziarski\n1994), but for an inner disc corona the behaviour is more\ncomplex. Only the inner disc temperature and luminosity\nare reduced, but these form the seed photons for the Compton scattering. For a fraction f of the total accretion power\ndissipated in the corona, the inner disc temperature is reduced by a factor (1 \u2212 f )1/4 (Svensson & Zdziarski 1994).\nThis is an underestimate of the inner disc temperature as it\nintercepts and reprocesses a large fraction (up to a half) of\nthe coronal flux. We will do more detailed modelling of this\nin a subsequent paper, but estimate that the size of this effect is not enough to make the temperature and luminosity\nconsistent with the standard high/soft state radius disc.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nA SCENARIO FOR THE DISC EVOLUTION\nIN THE 1998 OUTBURST OF XTE J1550-564\nA scenario derived by spectral studies\n\nThe discussion above shows that there are no easy alternatives to the conclusion that the inner disc is truncated in\nthe strongly Comptonised very high state spectra. If so, then\nthere must be some overlap between the inner hot region and\nthe truncated disc in order for it to intercept enough seed\nphotons, but the larger radius disc can trivially produce the\nlower observed disc temperature at high luminosity. This\ngeometry is rather similar to the truncated disc/hot inner\nflow inferred for the low/hard state, so would give a physical basis for the well known similarities between the very\nhigh state spectra and the intermediate state spectra (seen\ntowards the very end of the low/hard state; Belloni et al.\n1996; Mendez et al. 1997). It could also explain the lower\nfrequency QPO seen in the very high state (e.g. the review\nby van der Klis 2000; di Matteo & Psaltis 1999).\nA schematic picture for the whole disc evolution during the 1998 outburst of XTE J1550 \u2212 564 is shown in\nFig. 10. The outburst starts in the low/hard state, with a\ntruncated disc, and hot inner flow (panel a). The increase\nin mass accretion rate increases the optical depth of the inner flow before the inner disc has time to form, leading to\nan optically thick, cooler inner flow and truncated disc (the\nstrongly Comptonised very high state, panel b) on \u223cday 5\n\n(WD01). During days 5\u201330, the fraction of energy dissipated\nin the corona to that from the disc is kept almost constant\n(Fig. 5f), while Te and \u0393thc of the corona changed with time\n(Fig. 5d and e). Through this period, the X-ray flux reached\nat the peak (day 13). The radio flare was observed at this\ntime with a continuance of 5 days, and VLBA image showed\nevolving structure (Hannikainen et al. 2001).\nDuring days 30\u201340 the inner disc is able to form at\nprogressively smaller radii, perhaps due to the correlated\ndecrease in fractional power dissipated in the corona (see\nFig. 5f) which reduces the coronal heating/irradiation. The\ndisc finally reaches the last stable orbit at around day 40,\ncausing a noticeable change in disc temperature behaviour\ndespite little change in luminosity (Fig. 5b). The power dissipated in the corona continues to drop, leading to more\nweakly Comptonised spectra above the untruncated disc\n(the weak very high state, anomalous regime; days 40-52).\nThis eventually becomes a small (< 20%) fraction of the\ntotal power, giving the standard high/soft state (after day\n52, panel e). This is similar to the geometry for the spectral states proposed by Esin et al. (1997), except that the\nstrongly Comptonised very high state spectra corresponds\nhere to a truncated disc.\nWhile this gives a good overall description of the properties of XTE J1550\u2212564 during its outburst, the remaining\nproblem is what makes the truncated disc with the strong\nCompton corona. Advection dominated accretion flows cannot be maintained at such high luminosities (e.g. Esin et al.\n1997), although these are only an approximation to the complex nature of the optically thin, hot flow which is predicted\nfrom numerical simulations (Hawley & Balbus 2002). Physically, such truncation could arise from disc overheating (Beloborodov 1998), or by strong conduction/irradiative heating from the corona, or, perhaps most attractively, by disruption of the inner disc by jet formation. However, the total\nmass accretion rate cannot be the trigger for this behaviour\nsince (apart from the peak) the very high state spectra have\ntotal luminosity which is similar to that in the disc dominated regime seen in days 100\u2013180. Therefore some other\nparameters are required to drive the structural changes in\nthe disc (see e.g. van der Klis 2001; Homan et al. 2001;\nMR03)\n7.2\n\nConsistency with the QPO behavior\n\nThe type of QPO seen is roughly consistent with the changes\nin geometry shown in Fig. 10, and with the spectral state\n(Table 1) as suggested by Homan et al. (2001) based on\nthe spectral hardness ratio. Since the QPO frequencies are\nthought to reflect the size of the Comptonising region and\nthe disc inner radii, it is meaningful to compare evolution\nof the QPO frequencies with that of disc inner radii estimated by the spectral analyses. As we can see in Fig. 1,\nthrough day 18\u201330, the frequency of the low-frequency QPO\nincreased from \u223c 2.7 Hz, and after the day 30, it was almost\nkept constant at \u223c 6 Hz. This is very consistent with the\ndecrease in rin derived from the spectra through days 5\u201340\nas shown in Fig. 5c. Indeed, Homan et al. 2001 suggested\nalmost the same scenario of evolution of the accretion disc\nbased on the QPO behavior.\nHowever, there is some inconsistency between the timing and the spectral behavior before day 18. On one hand,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fVery High State Geometry\n\nFigure 9. Other candidates of geometries of the material which\nup-scatters the disc photons.\n\nthe low-frequency QPO increased to \u223c 10 Hz around the\npeak (day 13). This frequency is higher than the \u223c 6 Hz\nwhich was observed after days 30\u201340, suggesting that the\ndisc extends closer to the black hole during the peak. Yet the\nX-ray spectra imply that the disc extends down to the last\nstable orbit during days 30\u201340 and truncates at larger radii\nduring the peak(Fig. 5c). Moreover, the high-frequency QPO\nwhich is sometimes seen in the very high state data (Fig. 1)\nshows rather different behaviour. In Fig. 4, we marked the\ndata points which have high-frequency QPOs with big open\ndiamonds. Some green open squares showed both the characteristics of large inner radius by the spectral fits and the\nhigh frequency of the QPOs. Therefore, the QPO and the\nspectral behavior are not easily consistent, pointing either\nto a lack of understanding of how QPOs and/or disc spectra\nrelate to the inner radius.\nAs a brief comment, the strong very high state data\nwith high frequency QPO and the low-frequency QPOs of\nthe higher frequencies may be considered to be relate to the\njet ejection. As described in \u00a7 4.2, the radio flux was observed\nto increase suddenly at day 13, the peak of X-ray flux (Wu et\nal. 2002), and the extending radio jet was reported on day\n15 by Hannikainen et al. (2001). In Fig.4, the data points\nwhich show strong radio emission were also marked with big\ncircle plus cross. Thus, the data with high-frequency QPO\ncan be understood to have some relation to the jet ejection.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n11\n\nFigure 10.

This most probably indicates\nthat the disc extends down to the innermost stable orbit\naround the black hole. This is clearly seen in the 1998 outburst of XTE J1550 \u2212 564. However, the strongly comptonised very high state spectra seen at the start of the outburst do not follow this trend. Careful modelling of these\nspectra show that the disc temperature is somewhat lower\nthan expected for the observed disc luminosity for a constant\nradius disc. Correcting the disc luminosity for the effects of\nCompton scattering in a disc-corona geometry make this\ndiscrepancy much more marked. We discuss the effects of\nchanging colour temperature corrections, and different geometries, but none of these can convincingly reproduce the\nobserved disc temperatures and luminosities. We will model\nthe effects of a more complex coronal geometry (e.g. one\nwith strong radial gradients in optical depth: Fig. 9d) in a\nsubsequent paper, but the simplest solution is that the inner\ndisc is truncated in the strong very high state.\n\n\f12\n\nAya Kubota, Chris Done\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank an anonymous referee for\nhis/her detailed comments.
