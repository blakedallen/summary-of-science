These characteristics give rise to interesting\ntransport phenomena such as the absence of backscattering [4], anomalies in the quantum Hall regime [2, 5], weak\nanti-localization [6, 7], so-called Klein tunneling [8], and\nelectron focusing analogous to optical effects that occur\nin negative refractive index materials [9]. As such, one\nexpects that grahene pn junctions should differ from traditional semiconductor pn junctions. The pn junction is\na basic building block for electronic devices. Developing\na quantitative understanding of graphene pn junctions is\nan important step on the way to realizing novel devices\nsuch as graphene lenses [9, 10] and filters [8]. Our goal\nin this paper is to demonstrate that the non-equilibrium\nGreen's function (NEGF) approach [11] quantitatively\nexplains recent experiments on graphene pn junctions,\nincluding the critical role of the junction depletion width\nand the increased in the odd resistance observed under\nlow source/drain charge density conditions [12].\nElectron transmission across a graphene pn junction\noccurs by interband tunneling. A theoretical treatment\nfor an abrupt, graphene pn junction predicts that for a\nsymmetric pn junction (i.e. one in which the hole and\nelectron densities on each side of the junction are equal)\nthe transmission probability is given by cos2 \u03b8, where \u03b8\nis the angle between the electron's wave-vector and the\nnormal to the junction interface [8]. Realistic pn junctions will have a transition region of finite width. For\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: tonyaslow@gmail.com\n\na smooth junction transition region of width Dw , the\nWentzel Kramers Brillouin (WKB) approximation can\nbe used to show that the transmission probability for\n2\na symmetric pn junction is e\u2212\u03c0kf Dw sin (\u03b8)/2 [13], where\nkf is the Fermi wave-vector. Whether the transition region is abrupt or graded, the transmission is perfect when\n\u03b8=0 (i.e. commonly refered to as Klein tunneling), but\nthe transmission decreases as \u03b8 and Dw increase. This\nangular selectivity for electron transport across the pn\njunction serves as a filter, allowing states with |\u03b8|\u2264\u03c3\u03b8\n(where \u03c3\u03b8 is the spread of the angular distribution) to\npass through more effectively. The quantity 2\u03c3\u03b8 can be\nviewed as the bandwidth of this filter and is what gives\nrise to the larger resistance of a pn junction as compared\nto a uniform graphene sheet.\nSeveral research groups have recently fabricated\ngraphene pnp devices by using electrostatic gates to create p and n regions [12, 14, 15, 16]. The typical setup\nconsists of a back-gate and top-gate, which are used to\ncontrol the amount of charge density in the source/drain\nand channel regions respectively. For example, the back\ngates can be set to produce n-type source and drain regions and the top gate can be biased to change the middle\n(channel) region from n to p type. An asymmetry in the\ndevice's source to drain resistance as a function of topgate voltage has been experimentally observed [12]. The\namount of this resistance asymmetry is a measure of the\nintrinsic property of the pn junction, provided that the\nmean free path of carriers is larger than the transition\nlength of the junction. One can theoretically compute\nthe junction's transition length accounting for non-linear\nscreening effects [17]. For recent experiments [12], typical\ntransition lengths for pn junction are less than 100nm.\nRecent experiments indicate that the carrier's mean free\npath is about 100nm under low temperature and moderate carrier density conditions of 1012 cm\u22122 [18]. In addition, there is experimental evidence of Fabry-Perot inter-\n\n\fFigure 1\n\nII.\n\nGRAPHENE PN JUNCTIONS AND\nRESISTANCE ASYMMETRY\n\nBefore describing the simulation method used in this\nstudy, we define some terms that will be used in subsequent discussions, present a simple picture of the conductance of a graphene npn or pnp junction, and identify the\nissues that will be addressed in the numerical study. Figure 1(a,b) are depictions of the energy band diagram for\nthe experiment, which shows the location of the intersection of the conduction and valence bands (the so-called\nDirac point) vs. position. A back gate controls the location of the Fermi level, Ef , in the source/drain regions.\nFor Ef >0 (above the Dirac point), there is an increase\nof electrons with respect to Ef =0 , the electron density\nis greater than zero, n1 >0, and the material is n-type.\nIf the back gate is biased negative so that Ef <0, then\nn1 <0 and the source/drain regions are p-type. Similarly,\nthe channel (middle) region can be biased by a top gate\nto be either p-type (n2 <0) or n-type (n2 >0). The top\ngate also controls the built-in potential, Vpn , of the np/nn\njunction. Thus, appropriate top and bottom gate voltages can produce npn, nnn, pnp, or ppp structures. Near\nequilibrium conditions are assumed, so that the source\nand drain Fermi energies are the same. In this paper,\nwe shall assume that the channel length is greater than\n\n(b) nnn\n\n(a) npn\n\nn1>0\n\nn1>0\n\nn1>0\n\nVPN\n\nn1>0\n\nn2>0\n\nEF\n\nEF\nn2<0\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\nnn\n\nnp\n\n0.0\n\npp\n\n-0.2\n\npn\n\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\nConductance (2e /h) um\n\n-1\n\n0.8\n\nFermi Energy Ef (eV)\n\nference effects within the channel region in devices with\nchannel lengths less than 100nm [19, 20], evidently a signature of phase coherent transport. Therefore, a ballistic\ntransport model is sufficient for the study of the experimental pn junction devices reported in [12].\nIn this paper, we present a quantitative study of the\nnear-equilibrium IV characteristics of graphene pn junctions. In particular, we present a systematic study of the\nimpact of the junction transition width, Dw , on the transport properties of graphene pn junctions. We use the\nnon-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) approach with\na nearest neighbor tight-binding description of graphene.\nThis method allows us to accurately simulate the pn junction conductance for both abrupt and graded junctions\nunder different bias conditions. The value of Dw is not\nknown a priori because it depends on charge screening\nand the gate potential as governed by the Poisson equation. In this work, we employ the analytical screening\nmodel derived in [17]. Our numerical result based on the\nassumption of ballistic transport is in reasonable quantitative agreement with the experiments reported in [12].\nAs has been noted previously, we also found that the\nconductance follows an inverse square root dependence\non Dw when Dw is large [13], but we find strong deviations from this trend occur when Dw is sufficiently\nsmall. Understanding this regime of operation has practical importance because devices based on the electron\nfocusing property of graphene pn junctions, i.e. graphene\nlenses [9, 10] and filters [8], are expected to operate in this\nregime.\n\n2\n\n(c)\n\n-0.8\n0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.2 -0.4 -0.6 -0.8\n\nBuilt-in Potential Vpn (eV)\n\n280\n240\n200\n160\n120\n80\n40\n\n(d)\n\n0\n-0.2\n\nEF=0.3eV\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nBuilt-in Potential Vpn (eV)\n\nFIG. 1: The energy band diagram of graphene npn and nnn devices\ndepicted in (a) and (b) respectively.

Therefore,\nwe can reduce the problem by only studying the transport across a single pn junction.\nAs a first step to understanding the near-equilibrium\nconductance of a pn junction, \u03c3pn (S/um), as a function\nof Vpn and Ef conditions, we adopt a simple density-ofstates argument in the Landauer picture. In this simple\nanalysis, \u03c3pn can be written in the following form,\n\u03c3pn =\n\n2e2\nmin (M1 , M2 )\nWh\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M1/2 is the number of modes in the source/channel\nrespectively and W is the device width. Eq. 1 mimicks the matching of transverse momentum between the\nsource and channel in a ballistic manner, such that the\ncurrent will be limited by the region with the smaller\nnumber of modes. In this simple exercise, we assume a\nzero temperature treatment, so that M1/2 refers to the\nnumber of modes at their respective Ef .\nFigure 1(c) is an intensity plot of \u03c3pn computed using Eq. 1 versus Vpn and Ef . The dark blue lines are\nregions of low current. The horizontal line occurs when\nthe source Fermi level is at the Dirac point. Since n1 =0,\nso no current flows. The diagonal black line described by\nVpn =Ef occurs when the channel region is adjusted to\nplace the Dirac point in the channel at the Fermi energy\nof the carrier. Since n2 =0 along this diagonal line, no\ncurrent flows. Very similar features are observed experimentally [12, 19]. Looking more closely, we can plot \u03c3pn\nvs. Vpn at a fixed Ef =0.3eV . As shown in Fig. 1 (d), the\nconductance vs. Vpn is symmetrical about Vpn =Ef . In\nexperiments, an asymmetry about Vpn =Ef is observed\n[12, 19]. This asymmetry cannot be captured by simple density-of-states argument because its origin is quan-\n\n\fFigure 1\n\nTotal Transmission\n\n4.0\n\n3\n\n4.0\n\n(a)\n\n3.5\n\n32 Layers:\n3.5 Semicon\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\nTB Realspace\nTB Modespace\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n, where acc =1.44\u00c5 is the c-c bond distance.

Assuming that the device width is large and homogeneous\nalong the direction transverse to current flow, we can\nwrite the Hamiltonian as\n3\n\u03b1 \u03b21\n\u2020\n6 \u03b21 \u03b1 \u03b22\n7\n6\n7\n.\nH=6\n\u2020\n.. 7\n6\n7\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n2\n4\n5\n.. ..\n.\n.\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b21 and \u03b22 are all 2 \u00d7 2 matrices given by,\n\u00bb\n\u03b1=\n\n0 tc\ntc 0\n\n\u2013\n\n\u00bb\n\u03b21 =\n\n0 0\nt\u2020y 0\n\n\u2013\n\n\u00bb\n\u03b22 =\n\n0 0\nty 0\n\n\u2013\n(4)\n\nwhere tc is the nearest neighbor orbital coupling energy\n\u221a\nand ty =tc + tc eiky a0 .

In Eq. 5, Gn (\u000f) is the elecin\n\u2020\ntron correlation function given by G(\u03a3in\nl + \u03a3r )G . G\nand Gn are computed using the recursive green function\nalgorithm through Dyson's equation [29], and making use\nof the fact that the Hamiltonian is tridiagonal in nature.\nBy assuming an armchair ribbon configuration and imposing a box-boundary condition and solving the Dirac\nequation, Brey and Fertig showed [27] that the transverse\nmomentum is quantized according to\n\u201e\nky =\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0n\n+\n3a0\n2W + a0\n\n\u00ab\n\u00b1\n\n2\u03c0\n3a0\n\n(6)\n\nfor all integer n and W is the width of the device. The\nlast term accounts for the momentum of the Dirac points,\n~ and K\n~ 0 , where the upper/lower sign is used when n is\nK\neven/odd respectively.\nTreating the problem in terms of transverse modes\ngreatly reduces the computation burden while still providing accurate results when the potential in the transverse direction is uniform [30, 31, 32]. This approach\nessentially translates a two-dimensional real space transport problem into m decoupled one-dimensional real\nspace transport problem, where m is the number of relevant transverse modes. In the limit of large device width,\nW , we have m\u221dW \u000f. Fig. 2 compares this mode space\nmethod with two-dimensional real space NEGF calculations for a 55-layer metallic graphene ribbon and a\n32-layer semiconducting ribbon. 'n-layer' refers to the\nnumber of layers of carbon atoms along the width direction, where W = na0 . In both cases, the two methods\ngive nearly identical energy-resolved transmission functions for transport across a pn junction. The mode space\napproach has a computational burden that scales linearly\nwith device width, which makes it possible to study typical experimental npn-type structures.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 2\nA.\n-1\n\nConductance (2e /h) um\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n2\n\nFermi Energy Ef (eV)\n\n0.8\n\nnn\n\nnp\n\n0.0\n\npn\n\npp\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n(a)\n\n280\n\n200\n\n-1\n2\n\nConductance (2e /h) um\n\nn\n\nNEGF Cal\nSimple DOS\n\n\u03c3nn\n\n\u03c3pn\n\n160\n120\n80\n40\n0\n-0.2\n\n(b)\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nBuilt-in Potential Vpn (eV)\n\nBuilt-in Potential Vpn (eV)\n240\n\n3\n\n240\n\n-0.8\n0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.2 -0.4 -0.6 -0.8\n\n280\n\n\u03c3pn = 2 \u03c3nn\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n200\n160\n\n\u03c3pn\n\n120\n80\n40\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFermi Energy Ef (eV)\n\nFIG. 3: Simulation results from NEGF calculation of an abrupt\ngraphene pn junction with device width of 0.5um at temperature\nof 4K.

II, the experimental setup\n[12, 14, 15, 16] uses a back-gate and top-gate to control the source/drain contacts Fermi energy, Ef , and the\npotential difference across the pn junction, Vpn , respectively. The electron density in the source/drain regions is\nn1 and in the channel, n2 ; a negative value can be interpreted as a positive hole density. In this study, we assume\nthat the applied source-drain bias is small, in accordance\nwith experiments [12].\nWe shall also assume that the channel length is greater\nthan the carrier's phase coherent length, allowing us to\nignore any quantum interference effects within the channel i.e. Fabry Perot effects. On this premise, the transport process across a pn junction on one side of the channel would not be influenced by the presence of the pn\njunction on the other side of the channel. Hence, we shall\nfocus only on the transport across a single pn junction.\nWe begin by examining the pn junction's conductance\n(\u03c3 in units of S/um) when the junction is abrupt i.e.\nDw \u2248 0.\n\nConductance for an Abrupt PN Junction\n\nFig. 3(a), which shows the computed conductance\nas function of Ef and Vpn for an abrupt pn junction,\nexhibits the features typically observed in experiments\n[12, 19]. The four distinctive regime of operations (i.e.\nnn, pp, np and pn) are partitioned by the Ef =0 and\nEf =Vpn lines, which correspond to conditions where either/both the contacts and channel are at zero equilibrium charge density as previously discussed in Se. II using simple density-of-states argument. Examining more\nclosely, Fig. 3(b,c) plot the conductance as a function of\nVpn (Ef =0.3eV ) and Ef (Vpn =0.6eV ) respectively. The\nred solid line is NEGF calculation while the dashed black\nline is calculated using Eq. 1. In Fig. 3(b), one can\nclearly see the conductance asymmetry with respect to\nthe Vpn =Ef point. This conductance asymmetry is an\nexperimentally observed phenomena [12] which cannot\nbe captured by a simple density-of-states argument.\nConductance asymmetry refers to the difference in conductance between a np junction and its nn counterpart.\nBy 'counterpart', we mean that n2 for np junction is\n\u2212n2 for nn junction, while n1 is the same for both junctions. In Fig. 3(b), \u03c3nn is the conductance of an unbiased\ngraphene (i.e. Vpn = 0), while \u03c3pn is the conductance of\na symmetric np junction (i.e. Vpn = 2Ef ). Clearly \u03c3nn >\n\u03c3pn , a feature that is observed experimentally and captured by our NEGF calculation. The asymmetry is due\nto wave-function mismatch at the junction interface.\nElectrons in graphene have a two-component wave\nfunction, which is often refered to as pseudo-spin in analogy to the two-component wave function for spins. In the\nvicinity of the Dirac point, the two-dimensional Hamiltonian can be written in a form of Dirac equation [3, 4] i.e.\nH = \u03c5f ~\u03c3 * P~ , where ~\u03c3 and P~ are the Pauli spin matrices and momentum operator respectively. By convention,\nthe definition of pseudo-spin is such that its direction is\nparallel to the group velocity, since the group velocity\noperator is defined as ~\u03c5G = \u2207P H = \u03c5f ~\u03c3 . Fig. 3(d)\nprovides an illustration of the constant energy contour\nfor an unbiased nn graphene and symmetric pn junction\ncase. The arrows simultaneously represents the group\nvelocity and pseudospin, which points inwards/outwards\nfor the valence/conduction band respectively. For the\nnn case, the velocity vectors are similarly aligned for\neach side of the junction. For the pn case, ~\u03c5G changes\nsign across the junction. Analogous to spin, the wavefunction for the\u221an and p regions can be expressed\nas\n\u221a\n|\u03a8n i = (1, ei\u03b8 )/ 2 and |\u03a8p i = (1, ei(\u03b8+\u03c0) )/ 2 respectively (where \u03b8 = tan\u22121 (ky /kf )). The tranmision probability across the junction for a particular mode can then\n2\nbe written simply as |h\u03a8n |\u03a8p i| . For ky =0, the wavefunction is perfectly matched i.e. |\u03a8n i = |\u03a8p i, so transmission is unity (i.e. Klein tunneling [8]). Through theoretical analysis, we derive \u03c3pn = 2/3\u03c3nn , where the factor of 2/3 is due to \u03a3ky (1 \u2212 ky2 /kf2 ). Similarly, it can also\nbe shown that the conductance when Vpn \u2192 \u221e would\napproach the asymptotic value of \u2248(1/2 + \u03c0/8)\u03c3nn .

(a) plots the\nenergy-resolved local density-of-states (i.e. G\u03a3in G\u2020 ) for a W =0.5um pn junction device with a junction length of Dw =50nm and a\nbuilt-in potential Vpn =0.5eV . This is generated for the transverse mode with a transverse energy of \u000fy \u22480.075eV , which yields an apparent\n'bandgap' of \u22480.15eV as seen in the plot. \u000f = 0 is set at the Dirac point of the source (b) is the intensity plot of the transmission as a\nfunction of incident angle \u03b8 and Dw . The device is a symmetric pn junction with Vpn =2Ef , where Ef =0.3eV . An illustration of the setup\nwf m\n/\u03c3pn , for a symmetric\nis shown in the inset. (c) plots the fraction of conductance contribution due to wavefunction mismatch, i.e. \u03c3pn\npn junction (see Eq. 7).\n\norous NEGF calculations faithfully reproduces these features as shown in Fig. 3(b).\nIn summary, the conductance of an abrupt pn junction can be understood as being controlled by the region\nin which the number of conducting channels is smallest.\nWavefunction mismatch reduces the current by a factor\nof 2/3 in a symmetric np junction compared to an unbiased graphene. These features are captured by NEGF\nsimulation, but realistic junctions have a finite transition\nwidth, Dw , which, as we emphasize in the following section, plays an important fole.\n\nB.\n\nEffect of Junction Width on Symmetric PN\nJunction Conductance\n\nFor realistic np junctions, the transition length across\nwhich the charge density changes monotonically from ntype to p-type is finite. The width of the junction transition region has a strong influence on the conductance of\nthe junction. To understand these effects, it is instructive to consider each of the transverse modes individually.\nAccording to Eq. 6, for a wide graphene sheet, the transverse momentum with respect to the Dirac point is given\nby ky \u2248 n\u03c0/W where n is an integer. We can view each\nmode as a ray with an angle of incidence on the junction\n\u03b8 = tan\u22121 [ky (kf2 \u2212 ky2 )\u22120.5 ]. Fig. 4(a) plots the energyresolved local density-of-states (G\u03a3in G\u2020 ) for a pn junction with a transition length of Dw =50nm and a built-in\npotential Vpn =0.5eV . Only one transverse mode with a\ntransverse energy of ~vf ky \u22480.075eV is considered. The\ndark blue region correspond to a low density of states.\nBecause of the quantization of transverse wavevectors,\nan apparent bandgap of 0.15eV is observed. Therefore, electrons at Fermi energy of Ef <Vpn will have to\nquantum mechanically tunnel through this ky -dependent\n\nbandgap when moving from one side of the junction to\nthe other. This problem is analogous to the classic bandto-band tunneling problem in direct band-gap semiconductors [33].\nBased on this physical picture, Cheianov and Falko\n[13] worked out the WKB tunneling probability for a\n2\ngiven transverse mode to be e\u2212\u03c0kf Dw sin (\u03b8)/2 . This tunneling expression is derived by assuming a symmetric pn\njunction. In similar spirit to classic band-to-band tunneling treatment, the electric field across the pn junction is assumed to be linear, given by 2Ef /Dw in this\nwork. Realistically, the potential energy landscape at\nthe beginning/end of the pn junction would exhibits a\nmore quadratic profile. However, only the details of\nthe potential energy landscape within the tunneling region contributes to the WKB tunneling probability. In\nthis linear electric field approximation, the tunneling distance is simply given by, Dt = 2~vf ky Dw /Vpn . Fig.\n4(b) shows the NEGF-computed electron transmission\nas a function of incident angle, \u03b8, and transition length,\nDw , for a symmetric pn junction with Ef =0.3eV . As\nexpected, increasing Dw results in a decreased angular bandwidth (2\u03c3\u03b8 ) of the allowable transverse modes\nthat can be transmitted across the pn junction, which\nsubsequently leads to a decreased pn junction conductance. Based on the\np WKB tunneling forumla, it can be\nshown that \u03c3pn \u221d kf /Dw . This leads to the question\nof whether the junction rectification metric can be improved by using a larger Dw . Unfortunately, \u03c3nn /\u03c3pn\nwhich depends on Dw in an inverse square root manner,\nyields only a factor of 10 with Dw \u2248 100nm at a typical\nEf of 0.3eV .\nDevice concepts based on the electron focusing property of pn junction, i.e. graphene lenses [9, 10] and filters\n[8] operate best in a symmetric pn junction. These devices operate in a regime where \u03c3\u03b8 has to be as large as\npossible so as to reconstruct back a point source image\n\n\f0.8\nD\n\nw\n\n0.6\nD\n\nw\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n=5\n0n\nm\n\n=2\n5n\nm\n\n0.1\n\n(b)\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n(a)\n-0.2\n\nDw =0nm\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nEf=0.1845eV\nW=1.7um\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n0.6\n\nDW=0nm\nDW=50nm\nExperiment\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n12\n\n-2 -2\n\n-1\n\nn2-n1 x10 cm\n\nBuilt-in Potential Vpn (eV)\n\nFIG. 5: Theoretical resistance per unit width of a single pn junc(7)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = \u03c0/2. The first term in Eq. 7 is due to\nthe tunneling factor. The last two terms are corrections\ndue to wavefunction mismatch. Eq. 7 can be written\ntun\nwf m\nas \u03c3pn = \u03c3pn\n+ \u03c3pn\n. Fig. 4(c) is an intensity plot\nwf m\nof \u03c3pn /\u03c3pn as a function of Ef and Dw .

Evidently, conductance modulation is predominantly due to wavefunction mismatch only\nwhen \u03b3Dw kf < 1, which suggests that for the tunneling\ncomponent not to limit electron focusing applications, a\nDw < 5nm is required.\nIn summary, the conductance asymmetry of a graphene\npn junction is due to two quantum mechanical processes,\nwavefunction mismatch and the need to tunnel through\nan apparent bandgap induced by the quantization of\ntransverse momentum. Increasing Dw results in a decreased angular bandwidth (2\u03c3\u03b8 ) of the allowable transverse modes that can be transmitted across the pn junction. This leads to a decreased pn junction conductance\nand would eventually result in a larger magnitude of odd\nresistance Rodd .\nC.\n\nEf=0.1845eV\n\nOdd Resistance and Comparison With\nExperiments\n\nFinally, we shall examine the odd resistance, Rodd ,\nof pn junction devices and compare our NEGF result\nwith the experimental data reported in [12]. Typically,\nthe resistance asymmetry is characterized by analyzing\nthe resistance of the device as a function of Vpn at a\ngiven Ef . A quantity known as odd resistance, Rodd ,\ncan be obtained by taking the difference between the resistance of the npn and its nnn counterpart device i.e.\nRodd = 12 [Rnpn \u2212 Rnnn ], where the channel hole density\nfor npn is equal to the electron density for nnn. Fig.\n1(a,b) depicts the energy band of a typical npn device\nand its nnn counterpart. Rodd for a long channel device depends only on the odd resistance contribution from\nindividual pn junctions. Essentially, Rodd simply reduces\nto Rodd = [1/\u03c3np \u2212 1/\u03c3nn ] obtained by a simple sum of\nthe resistance of the two adjacent pn junctions. As a\nfirst step, we shall investigate the contributions of wavefunction mismatch and quantum mechanical tunneling\n\ntion as a function of Vpn at Ef =0.1845eV under different Dw conditions (b) Comparison of NEGF and experimental odd resistance\nRodd for different Dw plotting with respect to n2 \u2212 n1 .

Fig. 5(a) shows the\ntheoretical pn junction resistance as a function of Vpn at\nEf =0.1845eV under different Dw conditions. The odd\nresistance contribution due to wavefunction mismatch\nalone (i.e. Dw =0) does not adequately account for the\nRodd observed in experiments as evident in Fig. 5(b). In\nfact, it only accounts for 10% of the Rodd . Accounting\nfor finite Dw is essential to match the experimental data.\nIn our NEGF simulation, Dw is the parameter that we\nneed to determine prior to our NEGF calculations. The\ndetermination of Dw is an electrostatics problem which\nis sensitive to the specific device geometry. In this work,\nwe used the model presented in [17], which expresses Dw\nin terms of n1 and n2 as follows,\nDw \u2248 0.196 \u00d7\n\nVpn\n~vf \u03b11/3\n\n\u201e\n\u00ab4\nn2 3\n1\u2212\nn1\n\n \u0328\n \u03282\n \u0328 Tox  \u0328 3\n \u0328\n \u0328\n \u0328 n2  \u0328\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1=e2 /(\u03ba~vf ). \u03ba and Tox are the effective dielectric\n\n\f7\nconstant and thickness of the oxide between the top gate\nand graphene device respectively[37].\nFig. 6 shows the computed Rodd at different Ef conditions as a function of n1 \u2212 n2 and its comparison with\nexperimental data. The NEGF result achieves quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed odd\nresistance. In particular, the increase in odd resistance\nwith decreasing Ef , a puzzling feature in the experiments\n[12], is captured by the simulations. This occurs because\nof the increasing Dw with decreasing Ef i.e. smaller\nn1 which results in an increase of pn junction screening\nlength. We note conductance oscillations at the smallest Ef . These oscillations are likely due to interference\neffects within the device channel, which are more pronounce at Ef =0.1eV due to the large Dw which leads\nto an effectively shorter channel length. The 'spikes' observed in the NEGF simulations when Rodd crosses zero\nare due to the zero density-of-states at Dirac point. Such\nspikes are not observed in the experiments, probably due\nto the presence of spatial fluctuations (electron-hole puddles) when Ef approaches the Dirac point [34]. By construction, our NEGF model does not account for these\nelectron/hole puddles.\n\nsented a very simple minimum density-of-states (or conducting channels) model to account for the overall shape\nof the conductance vs. source carrier density and junction potential. Such a simple model does not capture the\nresistance asymmetry observed experimentally. We then\nuse NEGF simulation to explore in detail the role of wavefunction mismatch (also called pseudo-spin) and quantum mechanical tunneling through the junction transition region. In particular, we examined deviations from\nthe inverse square root dependence of \u03c3pn on Dw due to\nwave-function mismatch at small Dw . Finally, we compared the simulations to a recent experiment and showed\nthat the numerical model is in reasonable agreement with\nexperiments and explain the increase in odd resistance\nwith decreasing carrier density in the source. The novel\nfeatures of graphene's electronic structure lead to interesting possibilities for new devices, and this study shows\nthat NEGF simulation should provide a useful tool to\nexplore and assess device concepts.\n\nIn this paper we presented a numerical study of electron transport in graphene pn junctions.

As discussed in [17],\nthe accuracy of the analytical model is dependent on the\nphysical parameter \u03b1. The model would yield a possible\ndeviation from numerical results of \u2248 25% when \u03b1 \u2248 0.9\nat the charge neutrality point within the transition region. We emphasize that the error is of an oscillatory\nnature with the oscillation amplitude deterioting when it\nmoves away from the charge neutrality point. This would\nserve to alleviate the average error. While on the other\nlimit, \u03b1 \u2248 0.1 yields an excellent agreement with the numerical result. In the set of experiments we studied in this\nmanuscript, \u03b1 \u2248 0.78 due to a \u03ba \u2248 4.5. Therefore, the average error is intermediate of these two limits. However,\nwhen \u03b1 is large (approaching 1), one would need to also\naccount for electron exchange and correlation effects (see\ne.g. [35]), making the problem numerically non-tractable.\n\n\f"}
