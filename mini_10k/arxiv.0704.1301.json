The global infrared\nthrough millimeter spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two\ntemperature model (25K and 63K) with a total luminosity of approximately\nlog(L/L\u2299 ) = 5.2. Previous submillimeter imaging resolved this region into a\ncluster of five dust cores, one of which is associated with the ultracompact H II\nregion G23.955+0.150, and another with a water maser. In our new 2.7mm\ncontinuum image obtained with BIMA, only the UCH II region is detected, with\ntotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in the\nVLA centimeterwave maps. For the other four objects, the non-detections at\n2.7mm and in the MSX mid-infrared bands are consistent with cool dust emission\nwith a temperature of 13-40K and a luminosity of 1000-40000 L\u2299 . By combining\nsingle-dish and interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized\nC18 O cores in this region which contain \u2248 40% of the total molecular gas mass\npresent. While the overall extent of the C18 O and dust emission is similar, their\nemission peaks do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 infrared\nstars identified by 2MASS in this region are likely to be associated with the\nstar-forming cluster. Two of these objects (both associated with UCH II) were\npreviously identified as O stars via infrared spectroscopy. Most of the rest of\nthe reddened stars have no obvious correlation with the C18 O cores or the dust\ncontinuum sources. In summary, our observations indicate that considerable\nfragmentation of the molecular cloud has taken place during the time required\nfor the UCH II region to form and for the O stars to become detectable at infrared\nwavelengths. Additional star formation appears to be ongoing on the periphery\nof the central region where up to four B-type (proto)stars have formed amongst\na substantial number of C18 O cores.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\nSubject headings: stars:formation - ISM: individual (IRAS 18317\u22120757) - ISM:\nindividual (G23.95+0.15) - infrared: stars - ISM: individual (AFGL2194)\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe formation mechanism of massive stars is a topic of active research. Because massive\nstar formation regions typically lie at distances of several kiloparsecs, the identification of\nhigh mass protostars requires both good sensitivity and high angular resolution. As a consequence of their presumed youth, ultracompact HII regions (UCH II regions) provide a good\ntracer of current massive star formation (Wood & Churchwell 1989) and may be expected to\nbe accompanied by protostars in earlier evolutionary stages. Indeed, recent high-resolution\nmillimeterwave images of UCH II regions have revealed the high-mass equivalent of \"Class 0\"\nprotostars. Examples include the young stellar object IRAS 23385+6053 (Molinari et al.\n1998), the compact methyl cyanide core near the G31.41+0.31 UCH II (Cesaroni et al.\n1994), the proto-B-star G34.24+0.14MM (Hunter et al. 1998), the G9.62+0.19-F hot core\n(Testi et al. 2000), and the protocluster G24.78+0.08 (Furuya et al. 2002). To identify these\ndeeply-embedded objects requires an optically thin tracer in order to probe through the large\nextinction toward the giant molecular cloud cores that harbor them. Submillimeter continuum emission from cool dust is a good tracer of protostars because it remains optically thin\nat high column densities (NH . 1025 cm\u22122 ) (Mezger 1994). Similarly, spectral line emission\nfrom C18 O is a good optically thin tracer that can reveal areas of high molecular gas column\ndensity.\nOur target in this study, IRAS 18317\u22120757, is a luminous infrared source (log LFIR =\n5.2) at a kinematic distance of 4.9 kpc (vLSR = 80 km s\u22121 ). Based on its IRAS colors, it has\nbeen identified as a massive protostellar candidate (Chan, Henning, & Schreyer 1996). Previous single-dish radio frequency studies of this region have revealed hydrogen recombination\nline emission (Kim & Koo 2001; Lockman 1989; Wink, Wilson, & Bieging 1983) and water\nmaser emission (Genzel & Downes 1977; Churchwell, Walmsley, & Cesaroni 1990). The centimeterwave continuum emission shows both extended components (up to 13\u2032 ) (Kim & Koo\n2001; Becker et al. 1994) and a UCH II region (Wood & Churchwell 1989). The region has\nbeen detected in various dense gas tracers including the NH3 (1,1), (2,2) and (3,3) transitions (Churchwell, Walmsley, & Cesaroni 1990) and CS(7-6) (Plume, Jaffe, & Evans 1992),\nthough it was not detected in a methyl cyanide search (Pankonin et al. 2001), nor in a\n6 GHz hydroxl maser search (Baudry et al. 1997), nor in two 6.7 GHz methanol maser\nsearches (Szymczak, Hrynek, & Kus 2000; Walsh et al. 1997). The CO(1-0) line shows a\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ncomplex profile which has prevented the identification of high-velocity outflow emission in\nlarge-beam (1\u2032 ) surveys (Shepherd & Churchwell 1996).\nAlso known as AFGL2194, compact infrared emission was first detected from the ground\nin the K, L, and M bands by Moorwood & Salinari (1981) and later by Chini, Kr\u00fcgel, & Wargau\n(1987). Airborne observations of far-infrared continuum and fine-structure lines (S, O, N,\nand Ne) yield an electron density of 3500 cm\u22123 for the UCH II region and indicate a stellar\ntype of O9 to early B (Simpson et al. 1995). Complete infrared spectra (2.4 \u2212 195\u03bcm) have\nbeen recorded by the ISO SWS and LWS spectrometers (Peeters et al. 2002). At higher\nangular resolution, the region has been independently observed as part of two submillimeter\ncontinuum imaging surveys. In both cases, the emission is resolved into several components\n(Hunter et al. 2000; Mueller et al. 2002). Recent near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy has\nrevealed the presence of a small cluster of stars associated with the UCH II region, including\nan O7 star (with N III emission and He II absorption) whose ionizing flux can account for all\nof the compact radio continuum emission (Hanson, Luhman, & Rieke 2002). These developments have prompted the higher angular resolution millimeterwave observations which are\npresented in this paper in hopes of understanding this active site of massive star formation.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWith the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association (BIMA) Millimeter Array (Welch et al.\n1996), IRAS 18317\u22120757 was simultaneously observed in 110 GHz continuum and C18 O (10). The continuum bandwidth was 600 MHz. The spectral resolution for the line data was\n0.2 MHz (0.53 km s\u22121 ). The phase gain calibrator was the quasar 1741\u2212038. The bandpass\ncalibrator was 3C273. The absolute flux calibration is based on 3C273 and Uranus. A single\ntrack in B-configuration was obtained on 1998 October 10, and in C-configuration on 1999\nFebruary 5. The synthesized beam for the combined data imaged with robust weighting is\n4.4\u2032\u2032 by 2.3\u2032\u2032 at a position angle of \u22122\u25e6 .\nTo recover the missing flux from extended structures in the interferometer spectral line\ndata, a single-dish map of C18 O (1-0) was recorded at the NRAO1 12 Meter telescope on\n16 June 2000. A regular grid of 7x7 points was observed, with a spacing of 25\u2032\u2032 providing\nfull sampling of the telescope's 58\u2032\u2032 beam. The system temperature was 200K and the onsource integration time was 2.8 minutes per point. The data were combined as zero-spacing\ninformation with the BIMA data in the MIRIAD (Multichannel Image Reconstruction, Image\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated\nunder cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAnalysis and Display) software package. The resulting beamsize in the final datacube (with\nnatural weighting and UV tapering applied) is 10.3\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 7.1\u2032\u2032 at a position angle of \u221218\u25e6 .\nTo complement the millimeter data, infrared images and point source information for\nthis region in J, H and K bands were obtained from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\n(Cutri et al. 2003) and in the mid-infrared bands from the Midcourse Space Experiment\n(MSX) archives (Egan et al. 1999) and HIRES-processed IRAS data (Hunter 1997). Radio\ncontinuum images were also retrieved from the VLA galactic plane survey of Becker et al.\n(1994).\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nMillimeter and radio continuum\n\nThe 2.7mm continuum image from our BIMA observations is shown in grayscale in Figure 1, along with overlays of the 6cm and 20cm contours from the VLA galactic plane survey\nimages (Becker et al. 1994). At all three wavelengths, the source structure consists of a bright\nrim on one edge of a partially-complete shell. Both the IRAS point source and the MSX point\nsource positions lie close to the middle of the shell region. The bright, compact component\nwas identifed as an irregular/multiple-peaked UCH II region by Wood & Churchwell (1989).\nAt the two longest radio wavelengths, additional faint emission extends to the northwest.\n\n3.2.\n\nSubmillimeter continuum\n\nThe 350 micron continuum image from the survey of Hunter et al. (2000) is shown in\ngrayscale in Figure 2. For comparison, the position of the IRAS and MSX point sources are\nindicated along with the single-dish water maser position. Five independent submillimeter\nsources can be identified and their coordinates and flux densities are given in Table 1. The\ntwo dominant sources are SMM1 and SMM2. The peak of SMM1 coincides with the UCH II\nposition. SMM2 lies 22\u2032\u2032 to the west, and likely coincides with the water maser emission,\nwhose position is uncertain to \u00b110\u2032\u2032 (no interferometric observations exist). The water\nmaser is apparently quite variable over time: 60 Jy in 1976 (Genzel & Downes 1977) to\n0.7 Jy in 1989 (Churchwell, Walmsley, & Cesaroni 1990) to undetected in 2002 (H. Beuther\n2003, private communication). The three other sources have no known counterpart at other\nwavelengths.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- In all panels, the grayscale is the 2.7 mm continuum imaged with a 4.4\u2032\u2032 by 2.3\u2032\u2032\nsynthesized beam. Contours: upper right (2.7 mm): 3.6 mJy/beam \u00d7 (4 to 36 by 4);\nlower left (6 cm): 1.27 mJy/beam \u00d7 (-3, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96); lower right (20 cm): 0.35\nmJy/beam \u00d7 (-3, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768). Both centimeter maps were generated\nfrom data originally published by Becker et al. (1994). In the upper left panel, the dashed\ncircle marks the BIMA primary beam at half-maximum response. In the upper right panel,\nthe letters A, C, D and E correspond to the fitted position of the peak emission in the\ncorresponding MSX band (8.3\u03bcm, 12.1\u03bcm, 14.7\u03bcm, 21.4\u03bcm) all of which are contained in\nthe IRAS PSC error ellipse. The six-pointed stars indicate the positions of 2MASS star 86\n(nearest to the 2.7mm peak) and star 92. They are classified as O8.5 and O7, respectively\n(Hanson, Luhman, & Rieke 2002). The line marks the axis used to produce Figure 10.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.3.\n\nMid-infrared continuum\n\nEach of the MSX images of this field show that the mid-infrared emission is dominated\nby the UCH II region associated with SMM1. Contour plots of two of the bands (8.3\nand 14.7\u03bcm) are shown in Figure 3. The positions of the five submillimeter sources are\nindicated in both panels. The fitted positions of a two-dimensional Gaussian model in\neach of the four MSX bands all agree to within 2\u2032\u2032 and fall within the IRAS PSC error\nellipse. Of the five submillimeter sources, the peak in each band lies closest to SMM1.\nHIRES-processed images provide additional high resolution information from the IRAS data\n(Aumann, Fowler, & Melnyk 1990). The 20-iteration contour maps at 25 and 60\u03bcm are\nshown in Figure 4, again with the five submillimeter sources marked. The emission remains\nessentially unresolved in each band, though there is some hint that the two westernmost\nsubmillimeter sources (SMM3 and 4) are detected in the contour extensions at 25 and 60\u03bcm.\n\n3.4.\n\nSpectral Energy Distributions\n\nUsing the flux density data from Table 2, the mid-infrared through radio wavelength\nspectral energy distribution (SED) for the entire region is shown in Figure 5. The flux density\nmeasurements at wavelengths longward of 21 \u03bcm have been fit with a simple two-temperature\nmodified blackbody dust model plus a free-free component, summarized in Table 3. The flux\ndensity measurement at 1.3mm from the literature (Chini et al. 1986) should be considered\na lower limit as it was obtained with a single element detector with a 90\u2032\u2032 beam centered\non the IRAS position, which misses most of SMM3 and SMM4. The temperature of the\ncold component of dust (25K) agrees quite well with the kinetic temperature (25.8K) derived from ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) observations with a 40\u2032\u2032 beam centered on the UCH II\nposition (Churchwell, Walmsley, & Cesaroni 1990). It is interesting to note that the warm\ncomponent of dust dominates the total luminosity of the region, which is in contrast to more\nisolated high-mass protostellar objects (Sridharan et al. 2002) and even many other UCH II\nregions. Using the grain emissivity index (\u03b2) along with the temperature and optical depth\nderived from the fit, one can calculate the number of cold and warm grains required to\nexplain the observed flux density (Lonsdale-Persson & Helou 1987; Hildebrand 1983). The\ncorresponding mass of dust can then be calculated for each clump and for the extended emission. As is typical, the cold grains dominate the mass of dust. Assuming a gas to dust mass\nratio of 100 (Sodroski et al. 1997), the total gas mass of each clump is listed in column six\nof Table 1 and the total mass of the region is \u2248 7400 M\u2299 . Using the individual gas masses\nand source diameters (from the angular diameter and distance), we compute the column\ndensity of hydrogen (NH = NHI + 2NH2 ) toward each clump in column seven of Table 1.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- 350 micron continuum image of IRAS 18317\u22120757 observed with an 11\u2032\u2032 beam\n(Hunter et al. 2000). The UCH II position is marked by the star symbol. The cross marks\nthe water maser position uncertainty (Genzel & Downes 1977). The square contains the\nfitted peak of the single point source seen in all four MSX bands, which is contained by\nthe IRAS error ellipse.

The circles and dotted line defines the point sources and extended\nemission region listed in Table 1.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- MSX images of IRAS 18317\u22120757.

Gaussian fits to the HIRES\nrestoring beams are denoted by dotted ellipses. The crosses mark the position of the submillimeter sources SMM1-5 (Table 1). The contour levels are in MegaJy steradian\u22121 : 25\u03bcm\n(190, 381, 762, 1523, 3047, 6093, 12186), 60\u03bcm (258, 516, 1032, 2064, 4128, 8257, 16513).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nFinally, we have estimated the visual and infrared (K band) extinctions toward each clump\nby using the conversion formula of AV \u223c NH /(2 \u00d7 1021) derived from observations of the ISM\nat UV (Whittet 1981; Bohlin, Savage & Drake 1978) and X-ray wavelengths (Ryter 1996;\nPredehl & Schmitt 1995), followed by the relation AK = 0.112AV from Rieke & Lebofsky\n(1985). The extinction values listed in columns eight and nine of Table 1 have been further\nreduced by a factor of two to more accurately estimate the extinction toward a young star\nat the center of the clump, rather than behind it.\nAs the SED model predicts, the free-free emission mechanism still dominates over the\ndust emission at frequencies as high as 110 GHz. In fact, the image at this frequency is\nnearly identical to the centimeter images. The 110 GHz flux densities for the SMM1-5 are\nlisted in Table 1. Nearly all of the 110 GHz flux can be associated with SMM1, with the\nrest of the emission sitting just outside the 22\u2032\u2032 aperture used to define this object in the\n350\u03bcm map. By contrast, we have not detected any emission for SMM2-5. Each of these\nupper limits is consistent with an SED proportional to \u03bd 4 , corresponding to dust emission\nwith \u03b2 = 2. For the case of SMM3 and SMM4, they lie sufficiently far from the main source\nthat useful upper limits can be obtained from both the IRAS and MSX data which provide\na constraint on the individual properties of these dust cores. To visualize this constraint,\nthe spectral energy distributions of SMM3 and SMM4 are shown in Figure 6 along with the\ntwo most extreme models consistent with the data. The corresponding dust temperature\nand luminosity upper and lower limits are summarized in Table 4. Although the luminosity\nremains uncertain to within a factor of 30-60, the lower limits (\u223c 1000L\u2299 ) indicate that\nthese objects may be powered by individual massive stars or protostars.\n\n3.5.\n\nC18 O (1-0) images\n\nThe integrated C18 O (1-0) line emission (75-85 km s\u22121 ) is shown as grayscale in Figure 7.\nThe dotted circles denote the positions of the submillimeter continuum clumps from Figure 2.\nThe C18 O emission has been clipped (set to zero) at all points below 2.5\u03c3 (0.2 Jy beam\u22121 ).\nThere are five major peaks of emission, four of which agree roughly with the submillimeter\ncontinuum sources SMM1-4. The strongest component peaks very close (offset: \u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4 =\n+3.0\u2032\u2032 , \u22122.6\u2032\u2032 ) to a small cluster of stars identified by Hanson, Luhman, & Rieke (2002) that\nare associated with the UCH II emission and SMM1. Assuming optically-thin line emission\nwith T = 25K, we have computed the total column density of C18 O listed in column 5 of\nTable 5. These values have been converted to visual extinction AV using the relationship of\nHayakawa et al. (1999) for the Chamaeleon I dark cloud: N(C18 O)(cm\u22122 ) = 3.5 \u00d7 1014 AV \u2212\n5.7 \u00d7 1014 . Next, the values of AV have been converted AK (see section 3.4) and these\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Global SED of IRAS 18317\u22120757. The flux density measurements are summarized\nin Table 2 and the components of the dust and free-free emission models are described in\nTable 3.

The sum of all three components is\nthe solid line.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Individual SEDs of the submillimeter sources SMM3 and SMM4.

The solid lines indicate the warmest dust model\nconsistent with the data, while the dashed lines indicate the coolest dust model (17-41K for\nSMM3, 14-41K for SMM4).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nare listed in column 6 of Table 5. Assuming relative abundances of NH : NCO = 104 and\nNCO : NC18 O = 490, the gas mass of each clump has been computed and listed in column 7\nof Table 5. Likewise, the mass of gas associated with each of the continuum sources SMM1-5\nis listed in Table 6. The total gas mass (including the extended emission and all the clumps)\nis 7300M\u2299 . Although this value is in good agreement with the mass derived independently\nfrom the total 350\u03bcm dust emission, the fraction of mass in the extended emission (outside\nof SMM1-5) is 70% in C18 O but only 40% in dust.\nTo study the C18 O emission in greater detail, channel maps of C18 O are shown in\nFigure 8. We have analyzed these maps in two ways: we first inspected the maps visually,\nthen used an objective computer algorithm. In the visual method, we manually identified\n26 cores in position-velocity space. Shown in Figure 9 is a grid of spectra constructed by\nintegrating the emission in a 10\u2032\u2032 aperture (0.24 pc) centered at the position of each core.\nThe mass contained within these apertures represents about 40% of the total gas mass.\nWe next attempted to objectively analyze the C18 O date cube by running the \"clumpfind\"\nprogram (Williams, de Geus & Blitz 1994). This algorithm contours the data, locates the\npeaks and follows them to the low intensity limit without any constraint on the shape of\nthe resulting clump. It was designed to operate on large scale maps of GMCs in which\nthe emission is well separated into distinct clumps. Our data do not fit this description, as\nthe cores are embedded in significant extended emission. Nevertheless, we proceeded and\nused the recommended contour levels by setting both the starting contour and the contour\ninterval to be twice the RMS of the individual channel maps (0.6 Jy km s\u22121 ). The program\nidentified 17 clumps, three of which were weak and centered slightly outside the primary\nbeam (which we reject). The largest seven clumps range in mass from 200-1400 M\u2299 , while\nthe smallest seven range from 18-94 M\u2299 . The fraction of mass placed into these 14 clumps is\n45% of the total emission, which is quite similar to our visual technique. The emission from\nthe several cores in the western ridge (2,4,5,6,7,8,10) were merged together by clumpfind\ninto a single large clump in the late stages of the execution when the lowest contour levels\nare being examined. In a few other cases, two initial clumps merged into one. This merging\neffect of the algorithm explains the fewer number (but larger mass) of clumps found. The\nrest of the clumps are in good general agreement with our visual identification technique.\nA Gaussian line profile has been fit to each C18 O clump, and the corresponding velocity,\namplitude and linewidth is given in Table 5. Using the linewidth (\u03b4v) and aperture radius\n(r), we compute the virial mass from the formula: M = 210r(pc) \u03b4v 2 (km2 s\u22122 ) (Caselli et al.\n2002). In most cases, and in the overall sum, the virial masses of the clumps are quite similar\nto their C18 O-derived masses, suggesting that the clumps are in hydrostatic equilibrium. In\nonly three clumps does the C18 O-derived mass exceed the virial mass by more than 50%. The\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nhighest excess (76%) is seen in clump 18, associated with the UCH II region. Two of these\nclumps (17 and 18) lie near the UCH II region and also exhibit the steepest spatial profiles,\npossibly suggesting an unstable condition. A cut along position angle 80\u25e6 in the velocity\nchannel centered at 80.1 km s\u22121 is shown in Figure 10. The minimum in C18 O emission\ncorresponds to the presence of the free-free continuum emission along the southern portion\nof the shell structure seen in Figure 1, thus the steep profile may be due to interaction with\nthe UCH II region. In any case, considering the uncertainties in the C18 O mass calculations,\nthe good agreement between the C18 O mass and the virial mass is analagous to the results\nfound in a survey of 40 lower-mass C18 O clumps in the Taurus complex (Onishi et al. 1996).\n\n3.6.\n\nNear-infrared point sources\n\nIn the 2MASS All-Sky Data Release Point Source Catalog there are 123 objects within\na 1 radius of the UCH II position. Listed in Table 7 are the 44 of these stars that are\ndetected in all three bands. The K band image is shown in Figure 11 with the position\nof the C18 O clumps indicated by dotted circles. In general, the non-coincidence between\nthe two phenomena is striking. As listed in column 6 of Table 5, the extinction at K band\nthrough the C18 O clumps ranges from 2.3 to 12.5 magnitudes, with a median value of 8.1.\nThe faintest star detected has K magnitude of 14.44 while the brightest upper limit has\nmagnitude 10.11. Thus, even the brightest K band star observed in the field (star 112 with\nMK = 7.35) would be undetected if placed behind the typical clump. This fact may account\nfor the lack of stars seen toward the C18 O clumps.\n\u2032\n\nA (J \u2212 H) vs. (H \u2212 K) color-color diagram of the 2MASS stars is shown in Figure 12.\nThe solid line marks the locus of main sequence stars and the dashed lines denote the\nreddening vector which is annotated in magnitudes of visual extinction. We see that 19\nof the stars exhibit more than 10 magnitudes of visual extinction. Eleven of these 19 are\nlocated within the lowest C18 O contours (see Figure 13) and are likely to be associated with\nthe star-forming material of the cluster. For example, associated with the UCH II region is a\nsmall cluster of five stars. Of these five stars, star 92 is the object identified as an O8.5 star\non the basis of its infrared spectrum (with weak HeI emission) (Hanson, Luhman, & Rieke\n2002). It lies near the peak of the millimeter continuum map and is one of the few stars that\nreside within any of the C18 O clumps. The next closest star, number 86, lies close to the\ncenter of the shell structure seen in the millimeter continuum. Due to the presence of N III\nemission, it is classified as an O7 star. The ratio of He I to Br\u03b3 confirms the level of ionizing\nflux expected from such a star. To within a factor of two, it can account for all the Lyman\ncontinuum flux from the centimeter emission and probably explains the shell-like symmetry.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- The integrated emission from C18 O (1-0) is shown in grayscale.

Star 106 lies only 4\u2032\u2032 from the center of SMM5, while\nstar 47 lies at the edge of C18 O clump 12. Star 4 sits just outside the BIMA primary beam\nwhere very little C18 O has been detected.\nThe brightest star in the field, number 112, has J magnitude 8.7 and the colors of an\nM2 star consistent with about 3 magnitudes of visual extinction. It could be a foreground\ngiant at 1.8 kpc. There is no reference to it in the SIMBAD database.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA protocluster of massive stars?\n\nWith the exception of the two O-stars associated with SMM1, and star 106 possibly\nassociated with SMM5, none of the near-infrared stars are associated with the other submillimeter continuum or C18 O cores. The \"starless\" continuum objects SMM2-SMM4 may\nharbor embedded ZAMS stars or protostars that are not yet visible in the near-infrared,\nwhile the C18 O cores have not yet formed protostars. If so, they may resemble the lower\nmass prestellar cores detected by ISO (Bacmann et al. 2000). To examine this hypothesis,\nwe can compare the limiting K band magnitude of the 2MASS image with the expected\nbrightness of an embedded ZAMS star with total luminosity equal to the dust luminosity\nof each core. It is difficult to estimate the individual luminosities of these cores due to the\nlimited, coarse-resolution imaging data available on the mid-infrared side of their SEDs.\nHowever, using upper limits obtained from the MSX and IRAS images (as listed in Table 4)\nthe luminosities of SMM3 and 4 are constrained to be in the range \u2248 1000 \u2212 40000 L\u2299 , depending on the dust temperature. Assuming the temperature of 25K derived for the region\nas a whole, yields a typical luminosity of 2 \u00d7 104 L\u2299 consistent with a B0 star. A B0 star\nhas absolute visual magnitude MV = \u22124.1 (Allen 1976) and V \u2212 K = \u22120.85 (Koornneef\n1983), yielding MK = \u22123.25. At a distance of 4.9 kpc, this would be reduced to an apparent\nK magnitude of 8.65. If such a star was placed at the center of the SMM4 dust cloud, a\nK extinction of 6.4 magnitudes (see Table 1) would result, yielding a final K magnitude of\n\u223c 15. By comparison, the faintest star detected in the 2MASS image has a K magnitude\nof 14.44. Thus we cannot rule out the possibility that each submillimeter source (SMM2-5)\nmay contain a ZAMS or main sequence star rather than a protostar. Deeper imaging in K,\nL or M band would improve the constraints. At present, our best reasonable conclusion\nis that SMM2-5 contain some number of young stellar objects or main sequence stars with\nluminosities equivalent to at least a B-type star.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Near-infrared K band image of IRAS 18317\u22120757 from the 2MASS database.\nThe dotted circles represent the position of the 26 C18 O (1-0) clumps identified in Table 5\nand plotted in Figure 8.

The circled numbers are\nthe two stars associated with the peak centimeter through submillimeter continuum emission. Of these, star 92 is most closely associated with the UCH II region and exhibits an\ninfrared spectrum consistent with a spectral type of O8.5, while star 86 is classified as O7\n(Hanson, Luhman, & Rieke 2002).\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- The integrated emission from C18 O (1-0) is shown in grayscale and contours.\nThe dashed circle marks the BIMA primary beam at half-maximum response.

The cross marks the water\nmaser position uncertainty from Genzel & Downes (1977). The line indicates the axis used\nto produce the emission profiles in Figure 10. Contour levels are 20% to 90% of the peak\nemission (15.8 Jy beam\u22121 ).\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nWith the exception of SMM5, as one moves from east to west across the region, the\ngeneral trend is for objects in the cluster to exhibit fewer signs of compact, energetic phenomena. SMM1 is associated with the well-developed UCH II region. The dust core (SMM2)\nassociated with the water maser probably traces an intermediate stage indicative of outflow\nor disk activity from the protostar. The next two dust cores (SMM3 and SMM4) exhibit no\nmaser activity or ionized gas. We note that the dust-derived masses for these two objects\nexceed but remain in reasonable agreement with the C18 O-derived masses (within 27% and\n45% respectively). In contrast, the dust-derived mass of the faintest submillimeter source\n(SMM5) is a factor of 3 larger than the C18 O-derived mass. Unfortunately, the uncertainties\nin the mass estimates are too large for us to interpret this difference in physical terms (such\nas a depletion of CO, which has been seen in objects such as B68 by Bergin et al. (2002)).\nThe other molecular cores not seen in continuum may be the youngest features in the region\non their way to forming stars. Or they could simply be colder, inactive objects where the\naccompanying dust emission is below the detection threshold. Deeper and higher reoslution\nsubmillimeter observations are needed to explore these possibilities.\n\n4.2.\n\nFragmented structure\n\nThe C18 O emission of IRAS 18317\u22120757 is distributed in clumps aligned roughly along\nan east-west ridge. Evidence of periodic density structure has been previously observed in\nC18 O in giant molecular clouds, specifically Orion A (Dutrey et al. 1991). The typical spatial\nwavelength they find is 1 parsec, and the fragment masses range from 70-100 M\u2299 . More\nrecently, fragmentation has been seen to extend to even smaller spatial scales in Orion from\nVLA observations of NH3 (Wiseman & Ho 1998). Similarly, new observations of the ministarburst W43 in submillimeter dust continuum reveal about 50 fragments with typical size of\n0.25 pc and mass of 300 M\u2299 (Motte, Schilke, & Lis 2003). In comparison, C18 O maps of the\nTaurus complex reveal 40 dense cores of a similar typical size as those in W43 (0.23 pc) but\nwith a smaller typical mass of 23 M\u2299 (Onishi et al. 1996). In IRAS 18317\u22120757 the typical\nspacing we find between the major C18 O cores is roughly 24\u2032\u2032 (0.5 pc), i.e. intermediate\nbetween Orion and W43, while our fragment masses range from 35-187 M\u2299 , i.e. intermediate\nbetween W43 and Taurus. The fraction of total mass that resides in C18 O cores is 40% which\nis somewhat larger than the value of 20% seen in NH3 cores in W3OH (Tieftrunk et al.\n1998), and the 19% seen in CS cores in Orion B (Lada, Bally & Stark 1991). In any case,\nit is becoming clear that high-mass star formation regions, like their low-mass counterparts,\ncontain a wealth of information on the mass spectrum of protostellar fragmentation. Whether\nthese objects will all form stars remains unclear. A combination of single-dish and sensitive\ninterferometric studies will be needed to better quantify the picture, especially down to the\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nlow mass end of the distribution.\n\n4.3.\n\nFuture work\n\nHigh resolution mid and far infrared imaging is needed to accurately determine the\ntemperature and size of the individual dust cores presently identified, and to search for\nlower mass objects. Deeper imaging in the near-infrared is needed to search for additional\nZAMS stars at high extinction levels within the dust and C18 O cores. Also, narrow band\nimaging in H2 lines and (sub)millimeter interferometric imaging of SiO transitions may help\ndistinguish which of the cores show jets and outflows. Submillimeter interferometry with\nhigher spectral resolution in other optically-thin tracers less affected by depletion would be\nuseful to search for evidence of active infall toward the C18 O cores identified in this work.\nFinally, interferometric observations of the 22 GHz or submillimeter water maser transitions\nwould be quite useful to better localize the maser activity to SMM2 or one of the C18 O\ncores2 .\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur high angular resolution observations of the luminous (log(L/L\u2299 )=5.2), massive\nstar-forming region IRAS 18317\u22120757 have revealed a complex field of objects likely to be\nin various stages of star formation. Of the five submillimeter dust cores, one is associated with\nthe UCH II region G23.955+0.150, and another with a water maser. The 2.7mm continuum\nis completely dominated by free-free emission from the UCH II region, with total flux and\nmorphology in agreement with VLA centimeterwave maps. For the other four objects, the\nupper limits found at 2.7mm and in the MSX mid-infrared band are consistent with pure\noptically-thin dust emission at temperatures of 13-40 K and a dust grain emissivity index\n\u03b2 = 2. Three out of four of these objects have no associated 2MASS star, and they are each\nlikely to contain at least one (proto)star of luminosity 1000-40000 L\u2299 . In addition, we have\nidentified two dozen C18 O cores in this region which contain \u2248 40% of the total molecular\ngas mass (7300M\u2299 ) present. Their typical size is 0.25 pc and linewidth is 2-3 km s\u22121 . While\nthe overall extent of the C18 O and dust emission is similar, most of the emission peaks do\n2\n\nVLA observations undertaken by the authors on 2004 January 08 (project AH833) in B-configuration\nhave resolved a pair of 22 GHz water maser spots: one (at 18:34:23.99, -07:54:48.4) coincident with the\nsubmillimeter continuum source SMM 2 and the other one (at 18:34:24.49, -07:54:47.5) coincident with the\nmolecular gas clump number 16.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nnot correlate well in detail. Compared to the dust emission, a greater fraction of the C18 O\nemission exists in extended features. At least 11 of the 123 infrared stars identified by 2MASS\nin this region are likely to be embedded in the star-forming material, including two O stars\npowering the UCH II emission. Most of the rest of the reddened stars anti-correlate with\nthe position of the dust and C18 O cores and are likely visible simply due to the relatively\nlower extinction. In summary, our observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of\nthe molecular cloud has taken place during the time required for the UCH II region to form\nand for the O stars to become detectable at infrared wavelengths. Additional star formation\nappears to be ongoing throughout the region with evidence for up to four B-type (proto)stars\nscattered amongst more than two dozen molecular gas cores.\nWe thank Yu-Nung Su for obtaining the 12-Meter data for us, Robert Becker for providing freshly-prepared VLA survey images, and Ed Churchwell for providing valuable comments on the manuscript.
