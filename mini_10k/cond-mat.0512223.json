Introduction\nA fundamental problem of theoretical solid-state chemistry is, assuming the ability\nto compute perfectly the total energy of a complex compound, to discover which\narrangement of the atoms minimizes that energy. Quasicrystals offer a wonderful\nopportunity to face this problem, as many different arrangements are low in energy,\nbut this approximate degeneracy is resolved by more subtle interactions, often in\nseveral steps of a hierarchy of length scales.\nConsider decagonal Al-Co-Ni, the pre-eminent decagonal Al-TM quasicrystal\n(TM= transition metal), a phase which is divided into many modifications [1], of\nwhich the simplest are 'basic' Ni-rich (around Al70 Co10 Ni20 ) and 'basic' Co-rich\n(around Al70 Co20 Ni10 ). Mihalkovi\u010d et al [2] proposed a general method to discover\nthe ground-state structure, taking as inputs the interatomic pair potentials, derived\nby Moriarty and Widom [3] using 'generalized pseudopotential theory', and the\nexperimentally determined lattice constants. One initially describes the quasicrystal\nby a Penrose tiling of edge a0 \u2248 2.45 \u00c5 with properly placed candidate sites on the\ntiles. Monte Carlo annealing, in which atoms hop on these sites, is used to find lowenergy configurations. (This approach was used earlier by Cockayne and Widom [4]\n\n\fCo-rich decagonal Al-Co-Ni\n\n2\n\nfor decagonal Al-Co; Mihalkovi\u010d et al [2] added tile rearrangements as a helpful\nMonte Carlo move.). In the next stage, motifs abstracted from these results are\nconverted into rules to decorate larger tiles, thereby reducing the degrees of freedom\nand permitting larger simulation cells in which further orderings can be seen.\n2. Structure motifs and idealized decoration\nWe have applied this method to the 'basic' Co-rich composition (more complete\naccounts may be found in Refs. [5, 6].) From the initial stage simulation it became\nclear that the dominant motif is a decagon with edge \u03c4 a0 \u2248 4\u00c5 and hence diameter\n2\u03c4 2 a0 \u2248 12.8\u00c5; in this rest of this paper, the term '13 \u00c5 Decagon' refers exclusively\nto this object. The exact occupancies (fig. 1a) were clarified in the second stage\nof simulations. These were based on \u03c4 a0 -edge rhombi in arrangments favoured the\ndensest possible packing of non-overlapping 13\u00c5 decagons made from the rhombi.\n(Overlaps were verified to be unfavourable energetically.) The atoms in a cluster\nare grouped into concentric rings (see figure 1a). Just inside the perimeter, a few\nAl sites form a partial 'ring 2.5' with elusively context-dependent occupancies.\n(The Al positions on each 13\u00c5 Decagon edge (ring 3) also may depend on the\n13\u00c5 Decagon's environment.) Almost all the TM atoms in the 13\u00c5 Decagon are\nCo, which is presumably why it emerges at higher Co content. (This was also\ndiscovered by Hiramatsu and Ishii [7], who did an exploratory study using the same\ncode of a wider range of AlCoNi compositions.)\nThe best arrangements for edge sharing of the 13\u00c5 Decagons amounts to a\n10.5 \u00c5 edge 'binary tiling' [8, 9], with the 13\u00c5 Decagons sitting on the Largeatom sites of the binary tiling. Filling the space between is a secondary motif, which\nis centred on the Small-atom sites, which we call the 'Star cluster' and show in\nfigure 1(b). The centre of this cluster has a pentagon of five candidate TM sites,\nwhich are variably occupied by TM (almost always Ni) or Al.\nThe TM occupancies show context dependence, which we will approximate\nwith a very simple rule (figure 1c). We have four classes of TM atom. On each of the\nbinary tiling's Large vertices we have a 13\u00c5 Decagon with five Co(1) in its centre\nand ten TM(3) on its perimeter (ring 3). (For visual clarity, the TM(3) are not shown\nin figure 1c.) Now, on each (binary-tiling) edge connecting a 13\u00c5 Decagon to a Star\ncluster centre, a Star cluster TM is strongly favoured or disfavoured according to\nwhether the 13\u00c5 Decagon's first ring has Al or TM on the same edge. (The distance\nbetween these sites is 51/2 a0 \u2248 5.6\u00c5, which is a maximum of VTM\u2212TM (r) [3].] So,\non every binary-tiling rhombus exactly half the edges do not pass over a Co(1): let\nus place on each such edge a Ni(s) within the Star cluster, and make the TM(3) site\na Ni(3); all other TM(3) become Co(3). (As in the 'basic' Ni-rich composition, the\ndifference between Ni and Co potentials favours Ni occupancy in TM-TM pairs and\nCo in lone TM sites.)\nFinally, as this too is energetically favoured, we place 2 Ni(s\u2032 ) wherever two\nStar clusters overlap, that is once on each Thin rhombus of the binary tiling. In\na decagonal tiling, there is an average of 3.19 Ni on each Star cluster and the\ncomposition is Al70 Co21.2 Ni8.8 (assuming the TM fraction is 30%).

Filled circles are TM atoms in 13\u00c5 Decagon and Star cluster interior.\nThe \u00b1 sign on each 13\u00c5 Decagonindicates \u03c3i = \u00b11. Ni(3) sites are shown in\ngrey; there are Co atoms (not shown) on all other corners of the 13\u00c5 Decagons.\n\nversion of the idealization, including the placement of Al atoms, is described by\nGu et al [6], and gave a composition Al70.1 Co22.4 Ni7.5 , and it is even easier to devise\nvariants with higher Ni content.)\nThis model does not include the 'pentagonal bipyramid' motif that is prominent\nin the related approximant W(Al-Co-Ni) [10], so we have not addressed whether that\nmotif is favoured in the decagonal Al-Co-Ni structure [11].\n3. Orientational order and puckering\nA full structure description must specify, in each 13\u00c5 Decagon's first ring, the\norientation of the pentagon formed by its ring 1 TM atoms (this is prominent in\nelectron microscope images). Each orientation is parametrized by a spin-like variable\n\u03c3 = \u00b11, with \u03c3 = +1 when the Co5 pentagon (projected on the xy plane) points\nup, that iswhen the five Co lie in the even-numbered atom layers. We seek an\neffective interaction of neighboring 13\u00c5 Decagon's, like the spin interaction in an\nIsing model. A cluster arrangement with all clusters oriented the same will be called\n'ferromagnetic'; that quasicrystal has global pentagonal (not decagonal) symmetry,\nas is observed in fact for one of the Co-rich modifications [12, 13].\n3.1. Fixed site list: interaction via Star clusters\nWhen we simulate with a fixed site list, there are small energy differences that favour\neither the 'ferromagnetic' or 'antiferromagnetic' order of 13\u00c5 Decagon orientations,\ndepending on the atom density assumed and which approximant is studied, showing\nthere are competing contributions to the cluster-cluster effective interaction. (The\n\n\fCo-rich decagonal Al-Co-Ni\n\n4\n\n'ferromagnetic' effect wins for 0.068 \u2212 0.074 \u00c5\u22123 , which includes the physically\nmore reasonable densities.)\nWhere does the interaction come from? The only atoms that change with a\ncluster's orientation are the central Al and the ring 1 Al5 Co5 , but those are too distant\nto interact directly. (Our potentials were cut off around 7\u00c5.) An indirect interaction\nmay be mediated by other atoms in two ways. Firstly, the variable Al atoms in\nrings 2.5 and 3 are within range of ring 1 of both clusters; this guides whether the\nring 3 Al (in projection) divide the 13\u00c5 Decagon edge in the ratio \u03c4 \u22121 : \u03c4 \u22122 or\n\u03c4 \u22122 : \u03c4 \u22121 (See figure 1a.) This contribution favours 'ferromagnetic' order, so the\nshared 13\u00c5 Decagon edges will match. (Expressed in energy terms, the argument\nis related to the one for the 'puckering' case in Sec. 4, below.)\nAlternatively, neighboring TM atoms in the Star clusters interact with each\nother and also respond to the first-ring orientations of adjoining 13\u00c5 Decagons:\nwe suggest this is the origin of the 'antiferromagnetic' coupling, based on the TM\nrules of Sec. 2. Let us assume a repulsive energy V72 for Ni-Ni pairs on edges\ndiffering by 72\u25e6 as found by Mihalkovi\u010d et al [2] in 'basic' Ni modification. One\nsuch pair appears on each Fat rhombus having 13\u00c5 Decagons with the same\norientation. The effective orientation interaction is then 12 (1 + \u03c31 \u03c32 )V72 favouring\nthe 'antiferromagnetic' arrangement. Thus, the two indirect effects are indeed\ncompeting.\n4. Relaxation and puckering\nRelaxation and molecular dynamics of the structures found in the fixed-site\nsimulation were used to explore subtler aspects corresponding to small energy\ndifferences \u2013 including the relative orientation of neighboring clusters, which is a\nmajor focus of this paper. The most striking effect of letting atoms off of the fixed\nsites was that Al atoms in ring 2.5/ring 3 tended to run to new locations, in which they\ndisplaced from the layers in the z direction (puckering of atom layer). When we used\na simulation cell with four layers, pattern of puckering is such that lattice constant\ndoubled to 2c \u2248 8\u00c5. (That is the observed period of most Co-rich decagonal Al-CoNi modifications and approximants, and it was long known crystallographically that\npuckerings are the major way in which the real cells are doubled.)\n4.1. Channels\nHow shall we best understand the positions taken by Al after they are freed from\nthe fixed site list? Let us consider the net potential felt by an Al given the TM\natoms, which we fix on ideal sites (they hardly displace under relaxation in any case).\nWinding one-dimensional 'channels' are found along which the potential is low and\ncomparatively flat, typically between two columns of Co atoms (a ubiquitous pattern\nin the structure) forming a zigzag ladder, as shown in figure 2a. (Henley et al [14]\ndiscovered similar channels in 'basic' Ni-rich modifications from the time-averaged\nAl density in a molecular dynamics simulation.)\n\n\fCo-rich decagonal Al-Co-Ni\n\n5\n(b).\n\n(a).\n\u03c4 a0\nTM\n\n4A\n\nz\n\nCo\n\nAl\n\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\npuckered\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\nchannel\n\n(c).\n\nc\n\nmirror\n\n4A\n\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\npuckered\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nmirror\nideal\nposition\n\nU(z)\n\npuckered\n\n000\n111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n\nFigure 2. 'Channels' accomodating three Al atoms per four layers. (a). Path of a\nchannel favourable to Al between two staggered columns of Co atoms; positions of\nthe rigid site list shown as dashed circles. The farther TMs (grey) actually lie in a\ndirection nearly normal to the paper. (b). Single-Al potential U (z) in the channel,\nshowing minimum-energy configuration of three atoms with period 2c. (c). Four\nchannels adjacent to single Co column; the two channels in the plane normal to the\npaper break the period c symmetry in the opposite way from the other two.\n\nThe single-Al potential in a channel may be approximated as\n\u0010 4\u03c0z \u0011\n\u0010 2\u03c0z \u0011\nU (z) = U0 \u2212 \u0168c/2 cos\n+ \u03c3 \u0168c cos\n(1)\nc\nc\nUsing our potentials, \u0168c \u2248 \u0168c/2 \u2248 0.2 eV is found. Let us explain the origin of these\ncoefficients. The Co atoms adjacent to the channel have symmetry under one-layer\nshifts, which explains the period-c/2 term of (1). Its minimum occurs in each atom\nlayer, where the Al atom would be equidistant from three Co atoms at r \u2248 2.5\u00c5, the\nminimum of the VAlCo (r) pair potential.\nFigure 2 shows another column of TM farther away which breaks the\ndegeneracy between even and odd layers. This explains the period-c term in equation\n(1), in which \u03c3 is the 'spin' variable defined above, and \u03c3 = +1 (resp. \u22121) when\nthe distant Co atoms are in even (or odd respectively) layers. (The deeper minima\noccur in the TM-poor layer.) Note that Uc is proportional to \u2212dVAlTM (r)/dr, which\nhappens to have a maximum at r \u2248 4\u00c5, the distance to the distant column.\n4.2. Puckering\nNow, three Al atoms can and do fit into every four layers: their mean separation\n2c/3 \u2248 2.7\u00c5 is right at the Al-Al hardcore radius. Just where do they prefer to lie in\neach channel? The optimum configuration has a symmetry such that z3m = m(2c),\nz3m\u00b11 = z3m \u00b1 (2c/3 + u), [so the puckering displacement from a layer is c/6 + u;\nhere m is any integer.] The total energy (per Al) is\nE\u2261\n\n+1\n1 X\n[U (zm ) + V (zm+1 \u2212 zm )],\n3 m=\u22121\n\n(2)\n\nwhere V (z \u2032 \u2212 z \u2032\u2032 ) is the Al interaction along the channel. [Note a small abuse in this\napproximation: since the channels are not straight, the actual Al-Al distance is not\n\n\fCo-rich decagonal Al-Co-Ni\n\n6\n\njust a function of z [6]. Inserting zm into equation (2) and Taylor expanding in u, we\nobtain\n!\n2 \u2032\n1 \u2032\u2032 2\n\u2032\u2032\nE = E0 + U1 u + V1 + U1 u .\n(3)\n3\n3\nHere E0 \u2261 U0 + V (2c/3). Also, U1 \u2032 \u2261 U \u2032 (2c/3), etc; inserting their values from\nequation (1), minimizing with respect to u, and using U1 \u2032\u2032 \u226a V1 \u2032\u2032 , we find the energy\nminimumn\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u00112 (2U + \u03c3U )2\nc\nc/2\nEmin = E0 \u2212\n.\n(4)\n\u2032\u2032\nc\n3V1\n\nIt can be seen this solution is favourable when \u03c3 > 0; that is, the local mirror\nlayer of the Al's in each channel lies in the TM-rich layer [as observed in real\nAl-TM structures.] Then, when two (equi)distant TM columns affect the channel,\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c31 + \u03c32 in equation (4) and the lowest Emin is obtained when |\u03c31 + \u03c32 | = 2.\nThus the relaxed total energy of channel Al favours a 'ferromagnetic' alignment of\norientations, as was claimed.\nEach channel breaks z-translation symmetry in that the mirror-layer Al sits at\neither z = 0 or z = c, but not both. These channels interact, in a pattern [6] whereby\nfour channels get occupied around a single TM column, as shown schematically in\nfigure 2c; viewed in projection, the mirror-layer Al atoms involved in the channels\nform a sort of bent cross.\n(Note added. The puckering instability is presumably related to some very low\nfrequency phonon modes [15]; the channels are also the conduit for the strong Al\ndiffusion [16].)\n5. Conclusion\nTo summarize, the methods developed by Mihalkovi\u010d et al [2] in a study of\nthe 'basic' Ni-rich decagonal Al70 Co10 Ni20 quasicrystal has successfully led to a\nstructural understanding (at T = 0) of 'basic' Co-rich decagonal Al70 Co20 Ni10 ,\nwhich is described by a completely different tiling, despite a very similar nearestneighbor order. In this case, the key motif is a 12.6\u00c5 diameter decagon having a\npentagonal core.\nWe applied our approach to a unit cell the same size as W(Al-Co-Ni), a\ncrystalline approximant of 'basic Co'. Many details of our prediction (most\nimportantly the 13\u00c5 Decagons, and the locations of their centres) are in agreement\nwith the experimentally solved structure [17]. However, W(Al-Co-Ni) has a few\nhighly puckered sites which can not be captured in our approach which begins using\na fixed-site list and relaxes afterwards. [Mihalkovi\u010d and Widom [10] have given a\nmore thorough ab-initio investigation of W(Al-Co-Ni).]\nIn general, the simulations with a fixed-site list \u2013 followed blindly \u2013 would lead\nto an imperfect description of Al atoms in ring 2.5 and ring 3 of the 13\u00c5 Decagon.\nIn simulations with relaxations (and in reality), many of these atoms displace from\nthe layers, in a fashion which we have explained on the basis of the pair potentials.\n\n\fCo-rich decagonal Al-Co-Ni\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by DOE grant DE-FG02-89ER-45405.\nReferences\n[1] S.
