This Letter reports an event on 2005 January\n15, in which we found an asymmetric filament eruption and a subsequent coronal mass ejection together with\ncomplicated motions of HXR sources during the GOES-class X2.6 flare. The HXR sources initially converge\nto the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), and then move in directions either parallel or perpendicular to\nthe PIL depending on the local field configuration. We distinguish the evolution of the HXR source motion in\nfour phases and associate each of them with distinct regions of coronal magnetic fields as reconstructed using\na non-linear force-free field extrapolation. It is found that the magnetic reconnection proceeds along the PIL\ntoward the regions where the overlying field decreases with height more rapidly. It is also found that not only\nthe perpendicular but the parallel motion of the HXR sources correlates well with the HXR lightcurve. These\nresults are discussed in favor of the torus instability as an important factor in the eruptive process.\nSubject headings: Sun: activity - Sun: flares - Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - Sun: X-rays, gamma\nrays - magnetic fields\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring solar flares, H\u03b1 ribbons form along the magnetic\npolarity inversion line (PIL) and separate from each other in\nthe direction perpendicular to the local PIL (Zirin 1988). This\nwell-known behavior has been regarded as a piece of evidence for the so-called standard solar flare model, in which\nthe magnetic reconnection proceeds into the higher corona\n(e.g., Priest & Forbes 2000). Motions of flare ribbons parallel\nto the PIL are also commonly observed but had not received\nmuch attention until similar motions are found in hard Xray (HXR) or EUV/UV emissions (Fletcher & Hudson 2001;\nGrigis & Benz 2005; Yang et al. 2009). Since the HXR emissions are due to high-energy particle precipitating into the\nchromosphere, the parallel motion could also be associated\nwith the primary energy release from the corona, but its implication on solar eruptions and flare energy release is yet to\nbe explored (Lee & Gary 2008).\nRecently, the motions of flare emissions parallel to the PIL\nwere related to the phenomenon called asymmetric filament\neruption (e.g., Tripathi et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2009). During\nasymmetric eruptions, only one end of the filament erupts upward with the other end anchored, which can lead to a sequential magnetic reconnection along the PIL and may provide an\nimportant clue to understanding the parallel motion of HXR\nsources.\nIn this Letter, we investigate the 2005 January 15 X2.6 flare,\nin which we found both the asymmetric eruption and the parallel HXR source motion. We will discuss the implications of\nthe HXR footpoint motions on the eruption using a non-linear\nforce-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation from the active region.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe \u03b2\u03b4 active region NOAA 10720 lies close to the disk\ncenter (N15\u25e6 , W05\u25e6 ) when the 2005 January 15 X2.6 flare\npeaked at 23:02 UT in GOES soft X-ray flux. We used highresolution H\u03b1 \u2212 0.8 \u00c5 images with a pixel scale of \u223c0.6\u2032\u2032\nand a temporal cadence of 1\u20132 minutes obtained with the Big\n\nBear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to monitor the evolution of\nthe active-region filament and that of the early flare kernels.\nThe images of the eruptive filament as well as the surrounding coronal structure were also taken at 195 \u00c5 (with 5.26\u2032\u2032\nresolution and \u223c12 minutes cadence) by the EUV Imaging\nTelescope (EIT; Delaboudini\u00e8re et al. 1995).\nThe evolution of the flare HXR emission was entirely\nregistered by Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002). CLEAN images\n(Hurford et al. 2002) in the 40\u2013100 keV energy range were\nreconstructed using the front segments of detectors 3\u20139 (giving an FWHM resolution of \u223c9.8\u2032\u2032) with 20 s integration time,\nstarting from 22:32:04 UT, except the time interval of \u00b14 s at\n22:34:08 UT when the RHESSI attenuator switched between\nA1 and A3 status. Considering the characteristic shape of\nthe X-ray sources, we computed the centroid position of each\nHXR source by fitting a 2D elliptical Gaussian above a minimum flux value, and we estimated the statistical position error\nby varying the threshold at 40%\u201360% of the maximum flux.\nThe footpoint velocity was then derived using three-point Lagrangian interpolation implemented in the DERIV procedure\nof IDL, as it is less sensitive to the uncertainties in the position\nmeasurement. The total flux of each individual source was obtained by summing up the pixel values of the entire source feature, and its uncertainty was evaluated as 31 of the maximum\nflux outside of the source within the field of view (FOV), as\nimplemented in the standard RHESSI software package.\nIn this multiwavelength study, we used the full-disk 96\nminute magnetogram at 20:51 UT acquired by the Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI; Scherrer et al. 1995) for data alignment. The accuracy of feature matching is estimated to be\nabout one MDI pixel size of \u223c2\u2032\u2032 . Vector magnetograms of\nthe whole active region were taken by the Digital Vector Magnetograph system at BBSO (Spirock et al. 2002) and were\ncalibrated using MDI level 1.8.2 data. The vector magnetogram data have been processed following Jing et al.

The NLFFF model was\nthen constructed within a box of 248 \u00d7 248 \u00d7 248 grid points\nwith a size element of 1\u2032\u2032 using the weighted optimization\nmethod (Wiegelmann 2004) adapted to BBSO data (Jing et al.\n2009), the results of which show similar magnetic structure\nduring \u223c20:30\u201321:30 UT. For the purpose of this study, we\nanalyzed the preflare NLFFF model at 20:51 UT, which was\nchosen for the optimal observing condition.\n3. EVENT EVOLUTION\n\nBased on the HXR lightcurve, we divide the whole event\ninto five phases, I\u2013V (see Fig. 3a). We describe characteristic\nflare activities in each phase in the following subsections.\n3.1. Asymmetric Eruption (Phase I)\n\nTime sequence of H\u03b1 blue-wing images in Figure 1 shows\nthat the western part of the filament ( f ) lying along the PIL\ngradually rises upward from west to east during \u223c21:41\u2013\n22:00 UT and subsequently erupts, while its eastern part remains undisturbed as can be seen in the time-lapse movie.\nThis filament eruption from the western edge of the active region produced a M1.0 flare starting at 22:01 UT. The\nM1.0 flare appears to be a confined flare, since its flare rib-\n\nCME eruption\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\u2212100\n\n0\n\n100\nX (arcsecs)\n\n200\n\n\u2212100\n\n0\n\n100\nX (arcsecs)\n\n200\n\nF IG . 2.- Time sequence of SOHO/EIT 195 \u00c5 images showing the eruptions of the filament f and the subsequent CME. The dashed box in the upper\nleft panel indicates the FOV of the bottom 8 panels of Fig. 1.\n\nbons/kernels remain almost fixed till the occurrence of the\nsubsequent X2.6 flare at 22:24 UT (cf. images at 22:04 and\n22:24 UT). The confined flaring also implies that f undergoes\na failed eruption (Schrijver 2009).\nIn Figure 2, we further examine the following eruption\nbased on the evolution of overlying coronal loops shown in\nEUV images. Although f erupts (see images at 22:00 UT),\nmost probably it does not immediately open the overlying arcade, which expands from 22:00 to 22:24 UT (see the difference image at 22:24 UT) and finally erupts at \u223c22:36 UT to\nbecome a fast halo CME (also see Liu et al. 2010). Hence\nwe believe that although the first eruption of f (\u223c21:41\u2013\n22:00 UT) failed, the later eruption (> 22:00 UT) was successful to completely tear open the overlying field, resulting\nin a fast CME and the X2.6 flare. This process resembles the\nasymmetric filament eruption reported by Liu et al. (2009).\n3.2.

The angle of flare shear is seen\nto fluctuate until \u223c22:38 UT but decreases overall at a higher\nrate than that of phase II (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, N1 first starts\nat a slower speed (\u223c9.7 km s\u22121 ) and later the speed increases\nsubstantially (\u223c56 km s\u22121 ) as approaching the main HXR\npeak P1 (Fig. 4c). The maximum speed reaches &100 km s\u22121\n(Fig. 4e), which is comparable to other reported values of flare\nkernel motions found using high-cadence H\u03b1 blue-wing filtergrams (Qiu et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2006).\nIn Figure 4e and 4 f , we plot the speed u and the quantity uB2 of N1 in comparison with the HXR flux of N1 (IHX R\nin Fig. 4a). We focus on N1, because it has the strongest\nHXR emission and exhibits the most intriguing pattern of motion. The quantity uB2 is regarded as a proxy of magnetic\nenergy release rate under the standard 2D model (first presented by Isobe et al. 2002; see also Lee et al. 2006). We\ncompute B by averaging the four nearest pixels in the preflare MDI magnetogram around the position of N1 centroid,\nand we present two vector components of u along the eastwest and the south-north directions as uEW and uSN , respectively. Remarkably, five peaks (dotted lines in Fig. 4) of IHX R\nhave corresponding peaks in uEW B2 , contributed by the footpoint motion parallel to the PIL (uEW ), while only one peak\nof IHX R at \u223c22:38:22 UT (dashed line in Fig. 4) is cotemporal with that of uSN B2 due to the motion perpendicular to the\nPIL (uSN ).

Meanwhile, the flare\nshear, defined as the angle between the line connecting flare\nkernels and that perpendicular to the PIL (Ji et al. 2007), decreases steadily (Fig. 4b).\nSimilar behavior was observed before where flare kernels\nconverge mainly in the direction perpendicular to the PIL for\nthe entire rising phase of HXR emission (e.g., Ji et al. 2006,\n2007). In contrast, the converging motion in the present flare\nis mostly parallel to the PIL, which is oriented mainly in the\nwest-east direction (Fig. 3b).\n\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcsec\u22122\n\nF IG . 3.- RHESSI HXR light curve and images together with their centroid positions (pluses) showing the event evolution during four distinct phases (II\u2013V).\nContour levels are 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of the maximum flux at each instance.

See \u00a7 4 for details.\n\nas it remains when a three-point smoothing is applied on the\ndisplacement profile prior to the derivation of the footpoint\nvelocity. In phase III, the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient r indicates a strong correlation between IHX R and uEW\nwith r = 0.71 and a weak correlation between IHX R and uEW B2\nwith r = 0.44, but only poor correlation is present between\nIHX R and uSN or uSN B2 . Similarly for S1, the HXR flux better correlates with the parallel motion than the perpendicular\nmotion.\nAs a comparison, Grigis & Benz (2005) also reported a motion of two HXR footpoints parallel to the PIL. In their event,\nthe parallel motion was rather smooth and no correlation between the motion and the HXR flux was found. The authors proposed that the motion of HXR sources simply reflects a moving trigger propagating continuously along the\nPIL. Lee & Gary (2008) presented a generalized framework\nin which both the parallel and perpendicular motions represent the magnetic flux change in the corona as a way to\nexplain the correlation between the flux of a coronal HXR\nsource and parallel motions of H\u03b1 ribbons. In the present\ncase, the parallel motion of HXR footpoint sources shows a\ngood correlation with the HXR flux. This suggests that the\nparallel motion not only maps the propagation of the trigger\nbut also represents the primary flare energy release.\n3.2.3. Mixed Motion (Phase IV and V)\n\nPhase IV includes the peak P1 of HXR emission (22:45:02\u2013\n22:57:42 UT), during which N1 and S1 separate from each\nother (Figs. 3be and 4d) and N1 turns northward perpendicular to the PIL (Fig. 4c). IHX R has a main contribution from the\nsouth-north motion (uSN ) and shows a moderate overall correlation with uSN B2 with r = 0.5, in agreement with the standard\nmodel. The flare shear first decreases rapidly during the HXR\nmaximum before 22:50:40 UT then slows down (Fig. 4b), corresponding to higher and lower northward speed of N1, respectively. However, S1 does not move systematically at this\nphase. Similar type of motion was found in an event studied\nby Krucker et al. (2003) in which one HXR footpoint source\nmoves roughly along the PIL and is generally correlated with\nHXR flux, while other two footpoints do not show any systematic motion.\n\nPhase V has two minor HXR peaks P2 and P3 (after\n22:57:42 UT), with the conjugate footpoints, N2 and S2,\nshowing up in distinct, eastern section of the PIL (Fig. 3b f ).\nThe motion of S2 is parallel to the PIL, while that of N2 shows\nboth parallel and perpendicular components. A general correlation exists between all these motions with HXR flux. It is\nalso noteworthy that the flare shear actually increases \u223c30\u25e6\nfrom P2 to P3. This may be linked to harder HXR spectra of\nP3 than P2 found by Saldanha et al. (2008) for the same event.\n4. MAGNETIC FIELD STRUCTURE\n\nFor the eruption mechanism, we consider the torus instability (TI) the most appropriate for this event, because there was\na continuous flux emergence in the region (Zhao et al. 2008)\nand the supply of twisted magnetic flux into the corona tends\nto cause the TI (e.g., Fan & Gibson 2007). Kink instability (T\u00f6r\u00f6k & Kliem 2005) is excluded here because writhing\nmotion of the filament is not apparent. Other well-known\nmodels for solar eruptions, for instance, magnetic breakout model (Antiochos 1998) and tether-cutting reconnection\nmodel (Moore et al. 2001) are not considered because there\nare no obvious chromospheric brightenings before the eruption, either in remote regions or within the initial flaring site\nat the western edge of the active region.\nIn the TI model, the likelihood of eruption is gauged by\nthe decay index, defined by n = \u2212dlog(B)/dlog(h). Here B is\nthe strength of the external field confining the erupting core\nfield, h is the height above the photosphere, and n > 1.5\u20132.0\nis the theoretical instability condition (Kliem & T\u00f6r\u00f6k 2006).\nWe calculate the decay index at 42\u2013105 Mm using B(h) of\nthe NLFFF model (\u00a7 2) as an approximation of the external\nfield. Filament activation usually occurs in the similar height\nrange according to limb observations (see Liu 2008, and references therein). We note that the NLFFF model used here is\nconstructed at a single time in the preflare stage. Ideally we\nshould have used time dependent NLFFF models to examine the evolving magnetic fields. To obtain reliable extrapolation, however, we cannot use flare-time magnetograms. We\ntherefore only point out which field lines in the pre-eruption\nmagnetic configuration are involved with the eruption in each\nphase. Figure 5a shows the magnetic field lines stemming\n\n\fMOTIONS OF HARD X-RAY SOURCES DURING AN ASYMMETRIC ERUPTION\nfrom N1 and N2 at their locations in each phase, marked by\ndifferent colors. We calculate n at each position along the\nPIL with index XPIL (see Fig. 5a and also Fig. 1 top) and plot\nthis spatial distribution of n in Figure 5b. At each time of\nH\u03b1/HXR images, we also read off, from Figure 5b, the decay\nindex at the particular XPIL where the line joining two conjugate flare footpoints intersects the PIL (see Fig. 3b). In this\nway we are able to approximate the decay index for the coronal region undergoing magnetic reconnection as a function of\ntime, as shown in Figure 5c.\nIn phase I, H\u03b1 and EUV images show that the filament f at\nthe western edge of the active region failed to erupt, and that\nthe associated M1.0 flare is a confined flare. At the location\nabove f , the decay index n has an average value of \u223c1.84.\nSince this value is relatively low, the failed eruption may be\nexpected. Although it failed, the M1.0 flare must have affected the local magnetic field in a way to reduce the overlying\nmagnetic flux to some extent, so that the next CME eruption\ncan occur along with a stronger X2.6 flare. The successful\nCME eruption is anticipated, as the main flare phases II-V\nprogresses from regions of n about 2.5 to 3 with an average\nvalue of \u223c2.7.\nIn phase II, low-lying and highly-sheared field lines (red\nin Fig. 5a) are involved in the reconnection process, during\nwhich the flare kernels N1 and S1 converge with decreasing\nflare shear. This is consistent with the previous view that converging motion of flare kernels is due to reconnection proceeding from more to less sheared field lines (Ji et al. 2007).\nIn phase III, N1 and S1 move parallel to the PIL from east to\nwest, which corresponds to the motion from strongly sheared\nto less sheared fields (green) and also from stronger to weaker\nconfinement of overlying field (Fig. 5c). The location and\ndirection of this HXR source motion thus support the idea\nthat the CME, which abruptly erupts outward at the same time\n(Liu et al. 2010), acts as the moving trigger to successively\nopen the overlying field, in a way similar to the asymmetric\nfilament eruption.\nIn Phase IV (blue), one footpoint N2 shows a standard perpendicular motion while its conjugate footpoint S2 does not.\nIn phase V, N2 and S2 generally move in the opposite direction from west to east (yellow). Overall, phase V occurs in the\nregion with much enhanced decay index compared to phases\nII\u2013IV. In all phases, the reconnection evolves in the direction\nof increasing decay index, namely, toward the region of the\nmaximum n \u2248 3. It thus appears that the magnetic reconnection tends to proceed toward the regions with weaker magnetic confinement.\n5. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented a near disk-center event that shows\nasymmetrical filament/CME eruptions and associated flare\n\n5\n\nkernel motions observed at H\u03b1 and HXRs, and discussed the\nresults with the aid of NLFFF model. Major results are as\nfollows:\n1. The first activities occurred in the region of low decay index implying a strong magnetic confinement, which has produced a failed filament eruption and a relatively small flare of\nM1.0.\n2. The subsequent main event was initiated at the same region but proceeded to nearby regions of higher decay index,\ni.e., weaker magnetic confinement. The eruption at this stage\nproduced a CME and a stronger flare of X2.6 with complicated HXR footpoint motions, indicative of complex coronal\nmagnetic structure.\n3. Converging HXR footpoint motion was found in the initial stage of the X2.6 flare. As suggested before, it is considered as a result of reconnection proceeding from more to less\nsheared fields. In contrast to other events, the converging motion at the onset of this flare has a major component parallel\nto the PIL (cf. Ji et al. 2006, 2007), and the flaring scenario\ndoes not involve quadrupolar reconnection (cf. Ji et al. 2008).\n4. During the rising phase of HXRs, footpoints moved\nparallel to the PIL, a phenomenon similar to what was reported by Krucker et al. (2003), Grigis & Benz (2005), and\nLee & Gary (2008), and by Yang et al. (2009) in a statistical\nanalysis including this event. Grigis & Benz (2005) suggested\nthat the parallel HXR motion occurs because the trigger of\nmagnetic reconnection moves along the PIL. In this case, we\nidentified the moving trigger with the asymmetric eruption of\nthe CME. It is further notable that the parallel HXR source\nmotion has a peak-to-peak correlation with the HXR flux in\ncomplement to the standard 2D model.\nIn summary, the observations and interpretations presented\nin this Letter support the idea that an asymmetric eruption\nprogressively opens the overlying field from one end of the\nPIL to the other end, which results in a magnetic reconnection\nproceeding along the PIL. A new intriguing property is that\nthe asymmetric eruption and thus the corresponding trigger\nof magnetic reconnection tend to progress toward the region\nof weaker magnetic confinement.\n\nWe thank the teams of BBSO, RHESSI, and SOHO for excellent data set, and the referee for valuable comments that\ngreatly improved the paper.
