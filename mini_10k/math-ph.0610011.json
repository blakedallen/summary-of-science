We find such structures by means of the\nassociative version of Nijenhuis tensors. Explicit examples, e.g. for the harmonic\noscillator, are given.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nBi-Hamiltonian systems at the classical level, as noticed by F. Magri ([Ma 78]), play an\nimportant role in the discussion of complete integrability in the sense of Liouville.\n\u2217\n\nSupported by KBN, grant No. 2 P03A 031 17.\n\n1\n\n\fAt the quantum level, much earlier, E. P. Wigner raised the question: Do the\nequations of motion determine the quantum mechanical commutation relations?\nThe way Wigner formulated his question was the following. Assuming the equations\nof motion\nc\nd\n\u2202V\np\u0302\nd\ni q\u0302 = ,\ni p\u0302 = \u2212\n,\n(1)\ndt\nm\ndt\n\u2202q\nto find commutation relations such that\ni\nd\nq\u0302 = \u2212 [q\u0302, \u0124],\ndt\n~\n\nd\ni\np\u0302 = \u2212 [p\u0302, \u0124].\ndt\n~\n\n(2)\n\nWigner argued that equations of motion have a more immediate physical significance\nthan the canonical commutation relations\n[p\u0302, q\u0302] = \u2212i~.\n\n(3)\n\nThe commutation relations we are searching for should define a 'quantum Poisson\nbracket' in the terminology of Dirac [Di 48]. Indeed, Dirac shows that if we look for a\nLie algebra structure on the space of observables such that\n[A, BC] = [A, B] C + B [A, C],\n\n(4)\n\n[A, B] = \u03bb (AB \u2212 BA),\n\n(5)\n\nthen necessarily\nwith \u03bb being any complex number. To put it differently, according to Dirac, to look for\nalternative commutation relations (with the additional requirement (4)), it is equivalent\nto look for alternative products on the space of observables with the requirement that\nthe equations of motion define a derivation with respect to the associative product.\nRecently it has been shown ([MMSZ 97]), in connection also with deformed oscillators, that one may obtain a large class of alternative associative products of the kind\nA \u25e6K B = AKB\n\n(6)\n\nfor which the dynamics is a derivation any time K is an observable which is a constant of the motion. In particular, it has been applied to a precessing magnetic dipole\n[LPMM 97]. It turns out that all these deformations are compatible among themselves\nin the sense we will explain later. This is rather unsatisfactory, because in considering the classical limit of these quantum cases we should be able to recover Poisson\nstructures which are not necessarily compatible.\nThis note is an attempt to put the search of alternative associative products in a\nmore systematic setting.\n\n2\n\nSome important concepts in cohomology of algebras\n\nLet (A, \u2217) be an associative algebra and V be a A\u2013bimodule, respectively. In other\nwords, V is a module that is the carrier space for a linear representation \u03a8 of A and a\nlinear antirepresentation \u03a8\u2032 of A that commute.\n2\n\n\fBy a n\u2013cochain we mean a n\u2013linear mapping from A \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 A (n times) into V . We\ndenote by C n (A, V ) the space of such n\u2013cochains that can be regarded as an additive\ngroup. For every n \u2208 N we introduce the Hochschild ([Ho 46]) coboundary operator,\nas defined by Eilenberg and Mac Lane, \u03b4 : C n (A, V ) \u2192 C n+1 (A, V ), by\n(\u03b4\u03b1)(a1 , . . . , an+1 ) = a1 \u03b1(a2 , . . . , an+1 ) +\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03b1(a1 , . . . , ai \u2217 ai+1 , . . . , an+1 ) +\n\ni=1\n\n+ (\u22121)\n\nn+1\n\n\u03b1(a1 , . . . , . . . , an )an+1 .\n\n(7)\n\nIt is now easy to check that\n\u03b4\u25e6\u03b4 =0 .\nThe cohomology groups can be defined as follows: an n cochain \u03b1 \u2208 C n (A, V ) is\ncalled an n\u2013cocycle if \u03b4\u03b1 = 0, and an element of the form \u03b4\u03b2 where \u03b2 \u2208 C n\u22121 (A, V )\nis called an n\u2013coboundary. These form a subgroup B n (A, V ) of the additive group\nZ n (A, V ) of n\u2013cocycles. The cohomology group H n (A, V ) is defined as the quotient\ngroup H n (A, V ) = Z n (A, V )/B n (A, V ).\nFor instance, when n = 1, we obtain\n(\u03b4\u03b11 )(a1 , a2 ) = a1 \u03b11 (a2 ) \u2212 \u03b11 (a1 \u2217 a2 ) + \u03b11 (a1 )a2 ,\nand for n = 2,\n(\u03b4\u03b12 )(a1 , a2 , a3 ) = a1 \u03b12 (a2 , a3 ) \u2212 \u03b12 (a1 \u2217 a2 , a3 ) + \u03b12 (a1 , a2 \u2217 a3 ) \u2212 \u03b12 (a1 , a2 )a3 .\nThe simplest example obtains when V is the additive group of A, and then the\nA\u2013bimodule structure is given by left and right multiplication.\n\n3\n\nCompatible associative products and associative\nNijenhuis tensors\n\nBy analogy with the classical case, where a bi-Hamiltonian system consists of two\ncompatible Poisson brackets and a system which is Hamiltonian with respect to both\nbrackets, by a weak quantum bi-Hamiltonian system we shall mean two Lie algebra\nstructures on the space Op(H) of operators on a Hilbert space H (one of them will\nbe usually the original one) which are compatible in the sense that the corresponding\ncommutators are compatible Lie brackets (i.e. their sum is again a Lie bracket) and a\nderivation D \u2208 Der(Op(H)) which is an inner derivation with respect to both associative\nstructures [DMS 90].\nSince we want the Leibniz rule\n[A, B \u25e6 C] = [A, B] \u25e6 C + B \u25e6 [A, C],\n\n(8)\n\nin view of the Dirac's proof ([Di 48], pp. 85-86), that derivations of a sufficiently nondegenerate associative algebra are just adjoint operators, we would like to have a new\nbracket in the form of the commutator of a new associative structure. We will call\n3\n\n\fsuch pairs of associative structures just weak quantum bi-Hamiltonian ones. A possible\nadditional requirement is that both associative structures have the same unit 1. Let\nus note that one can also consider a stronger version of compatibility of associative\nproducts \"\u25e61 \" and \"\u25e62 \" requiring that \u25e61 + \u03bb\u25e62 is associative for all \u03bb \u2208 K, where K is\nthe ground field (then the mean (\u25e61 + \u25e62 )/2 is again associative with the same unit 1)\nand this is what we mean by a quantum bi-Hamiltonian system. We start with some\npure algebraic observations.\nLet (A, * ) be a unital associative algebra. A simple way to define a new associative\nproduct on A is to take an element K \u2208 A and to define a new product by\nA \u25e6K B = AKB.\n\n(9)\n\n(We will usually skip the product symbol for the original associative structure.) Observe\nthat the unit is not preserved unless K = 1 and that we have the homomorphism of\nthe products\nTK (A \u25e6K B) = TK (A)TK (B)\n(10)\nfor TK being the linear map\nTK : A \u2192 A,\n\nTK (A) = KA,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is an isomorphism (non-unital, however) in case K is invertible.\nThis example can be generalized if we deform the associative structure by an associative analog of the Nijenhuis map (tensor), known better in the Lie algebra case.\nLet (A, \u03bc) be an associative algebra over a field K, with the product\n\u03bc : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A,\n\n(A, B) 7\u2192 AB\n\n(12)\n\nand let N : A \u2192 A be a linear map (N \u2208 A\u2217 \u2297 A). If N is a derivation of the algebra\n(A, \u03bc), then N(A)B + AN(B) \u2212 N(AB) = 0. In any case, the map\n\u03bcN : (A, B) 7\u2192 A \u25e6N B = N(A)B + AN(B) \u2212 N(AB) ,\n\n(13)\n\nis a bilinear map and therefore it defines a new algebra structure (A, \u03bcN ). Using\nthe terminology introduced in the preceding section, and considering the A\u2013bimodule\nstructure in A as given by left and right multiplication, we can say that A \u25e6N B =\n\u03b4\u03bc N(A, B) and therefore that N is a derivation of the original algebra if and only if N\nis a 1-cocycle with respect to the Hochschild coboundary operator \u03b4\u03bc associated with\nthe product \u03bc.\nThe obstruction for the linear map N to be a homomorphism of these products is\nmeasured by the \u03bc-Nijenhuis torsion of N:\nTN (A, B) = N(A \u25e6N B) \u2212 N(A)N(B) .\n\n(14)\n\nDefinition 1 We say that the linear map N : A \u2192 A is a \u03bc-Nijenhuis tensor if the\n\u03bc-Nijenhuis torsion of N vanishes, TN (A, B) = 0, \u2200A, B \u2208 A.\n\n4\n\n\fIn this case N is a homomorphism of the corresponding products:\nN(A \u25e6N B) = N(A)N(B) ,\n\n(15)\n\ni.e.\nN(N(A)B + AN(B) \u2212 N(AB)) \u2212 N(A)N(B) = 0 .\nTheorem 1 The product \u03bcN defined by (13) is associative if and only if the \u03bc-Nijenhuis\ntorsion TN of N is a 2-Hochschild cocycle of the algebra A, i.e.\n\u03b4\u03bc TN (A, B, C) := ATN (B, C) \u2212 TN (AB, C) + TN (A, BC) \u2212 TN (A, B)C = 0.\n\n(16)\n\nIf this is the case, \u03bcN is an associative product compatible with \u03bc, i.e. \u03bc + \u03bb\u03bcN are\nassociative for all \u03bb \u2208 K. If \u03bc is unital with the unit 1, then \u03bcN has the same unit\nproviding that N(1) = 1.\nIn particular, if N is a \u03bc-Nijenhuis tensor, then \u03bcN is an associative product on A\nwhich is compatible with \u03bc.\nProof.- By direct computation,\n(A \u25e6N B) \u25e6N C \u2212 A \u25e6N (B \u25e6N C) =\n\u2212ATN (B, C) + TN (AB, C) \u2212 TN (A, BC) + TN (A, B)C = \u2212\u03b4\u03bc TN (A, B, C).\nAs for the compatibility, it suffices to prove\n(AB) \u25e6N C + (A \u25e6N B)C = A(B \u25e6N C) + A \u25e6N (BC),\n\n(17)\n\nwhich is straightforward:\n(AB) \u25e6N C + (A \u25e6N B)C = N(AB)C + ABN(C) \u2212 N(ABC)\n+N(A)BC + AN(B)C \u2212 N(AB)C\n= N(A)BC + AN(B)C + ABN(C) \u2212 N(ABC)\n= A(B \u25e6N C) + A \u25e6N (BC).\n\u2737\nThe relation (17) means that the map \u03bcN , as seen as 2-cochain in the algebra (A, \u03bc),\nis a 2-cocycle because\n\u03b4\u03bc \u03bcN (A, B, C) = A(B \u25e6N C) \u2212 (AB) \u25e6N C + A \u25e6N (BC) \u2212 (A \u25e6N B)C.\nRemark. Note that the compatibility condition (17) holds automatically, no matter if\n\u03bcN is associative or not. If we look for a new associative product \u25e6 which is compatible\nin the sense of (17), then this means that the new product is a Hochschild cocycle of the\noriginal associative algebra. If our algebra is, for instance, the algebra of n\u00d7n matrices,\ndue to the Morita equivalence (cf. [Lo 92]), its Hochschild cohomology are the same\nas the Hochschild cohomology of K (regarded as 1-dimensional algebra over itself),\nthus vanish in dimensions higher than zero, so our product \u25e6 has to be a Hochschild\n5\n\n\fcoboundary, i.e. of the form \u25e6N for some N. This shows that we have not much\nfreedom and, looking for compatible associative products, we must, in principle, work\nwith Nijenhuis tensors.\nThe above observations can be reformulated in terms of the so called Gerstenhaber\nbracket [ , ]G , which is a graded Lie bracket on the graded space of multilinear maps\nof A into A and which recognizes associative products (cf. [Ge 63, Gr 92]), in full\ncorrespondence with the analogous theory for Nijenhuis tensors for Lie algebras and\nthe Richardson-Nijenhuis bracket (cf. [KSM 90]). In particular, \u03bcN = [\u03bc, N]G and\n2TN (A, B) = [N, [\u03bc, N]G ]G + [\u03bc, N 2 ]G ,\n\n(18)\n\nso that the Theorem 1 is a direct consequence of the graded Jacobi identity for the Gerstenhaber bracket and the fact that [\u03bc, *]G is proportional to the Hochschild coboundary\noperator \u03b4\u03bc (In particular, [\u03bc, \u03bc]G = 0, so that [\u03bc, [\u03bc, N]G ]G = 0, which is the compatibility condition (17).)\nNow, we will show that a Nijenhuis tensor gives rise to a whole hierarchy of Nijenhuis\ntensors and associative structures, as has been already discovered by Saletan [Sa 61].\nPutting N k instead of N in the above, we can consider products \u03bcN k .\nLemma 1 If N is a \u03bc-Nijenhuis tensor, then the products \u03bcN k+r and \u03bcN k are N r related, i.e.\nN r (A \u25e6N k+r B) = N r (A) \u25e6N k N r (B)\n(19)\nfor all k, r = 0, 1, 2, . . ..\nProof.- We will start with proving\nN(A \u25e6N k+1 B) = N(A) \u25e6N k N(B).\n\n(20)\n\nApplying N k to the Nijenhuis torsion\nN(N(A)B) + N(AN(B)) \u2212 N 2 (AB) \u2212 N(A)N(B),\n\n(21)\n\nwhich vanish by assumption, we get\nN k+2 (AB) \u2212 N k+1 (AN(B)) = N k+1 (N(A)B) \u2212 N k (N(A)N(B)).\n\n(22)\n\nUsing (22) inductively for k := k \u2212 1, we end up with\nN k+2 (AB) \u2212 N k+1 (AN(B)) = N(N k+1 (A)B) \u2212 N k+1 (A)N(B).\n\n(23)\n\nIn a similar way, we get\nN k+2 (AB) \u2212 N k+1 (N(A)B) = N(AN k+1 (B)) \u2212 N(A)N k+1 (B)\n\n(24)\n\nwhich, combined with (22), gives\nN k+1 (AN(B)) \u2212 N k (N(A)N(B)) = N(AN k+1 (B)) \u2212 N(A)N k+1 (B).\n6\n\n(25)\n\n\fCombining now (25) and (23), we find\nN k+2 (AB) \u2212 N k (N(A)N(B)) =\nN(N k+1 (A)B + AN k+1 (B)) \u2212 N k+1 (A)N(B) \u2212 N(A)N k+1 (B)\nwhich can be rewritten in the form\nN k (N(A))N(B) + N(A)N k (N(B)) \u2212 N k (N(A)N(B)) =\nN(N k+1 (A)B + AN k+1 (B) \u2212 N k+1 (AB)).\nBut the last one is exactly (20). Now, applying (20) inductively\nN r (A \u25e6N k+r B) = N r\u22121 N(A \u25e6N k+r B) = N r\u22121 (N(A) \u25e6N k+r\u22121 N(B)),\n\n(26)\n\nwe end up with (19).\n\u2737\nTheorem 2 If N is a \u03bc-Nijenhuis tensor, then\n(\u03bcN i )N k = \u03bcN i+k\n\n(27)\n\nand N r is a \u03bcN i -Nijenhuis tensor, i.e.\nN r (A(\u25e6N i )N r B) = N r (A) \u25e6N i N r (B)\n\n(28)\n\nfor all i, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. In particular, all products \u03bcN k are associative and compatible.\nProof.- First, we show that\n(\u03bcN i )N = \u03bcN i+1 .\n\n(29)\n\nIndeed,\nA(\u25e6N i )N B = N(A) \u25e6N i B + A \u25e6N i N(B) \u2212 N(A \u25e6N i B)\n= N i+1 (A)B + N(A)N i (B) \u2212 N i (N(A)B) + N i (A)N(B)\n+AN i+1 (B) \u2212 N i (AN(B)) \u2212 N(A) \u25e6N i\u22121 N(B)\n= N i+1 (A)B + AN i+1 (B) \u2212 N i+1 (AB) \u2212 N i (N(A)B\n+AN(B) \u2212 N(AB)) + N i\u22121 (N(A)N(B))\n= N i+1 (A)B + AN +1 (B) \u2212 N i+1 (AB)\n\u2212N i\u22121 (N(A \u25e6N B) \u2212 N(A)N(B)) = A \u25e6N i+1 B,\nwhere we have used, according to Lemma, N(A \u25e6N i B) = N(A) \u25e6N i\u22121 N(B). Now, (29)\ntogether with (20) show that N is a \u03bcN i -Nijenhuis tensor which produces a compatible\nassociative product (\u03bcN i )N = \u03bcN i+1 . Thus we can apply Lemma and (29) to \u03bcN i instead\nof \u03bc that proves the theorem.\n\u2737\nThere is a way to obtain a new Nijenhuis tensor from two of them. Two Nijenhuis\ntensors N1 and N2 on A will be said to be compatible if N1 + N2 is again a Nijenhuis\ntensor.\n7\n\n\fTheorem 3 Nijenhuis tensors N1 and N2 are compatible if and only if\nN1 (A \u25e6N2 B) + N2 (A \u25e6N1 B) = N1 (A)N2 (B) + N2 (A)N1 (B).\n\n(30)\n\nIf N1 is compatible with N2 , . . . , Nk , then it is compatible with any linear combination\nof them. If N1 , . . . , Nk are pairwise compatible, then any two linear combinations of\nthem are compatible.\nProof.- The firs statement is a direct consequence of definitions if we only observe that\n\u25e6N1 +N2 = \u25e6N1 + \u25e6N2 . The rest follows from the fact that (30) depends linearly on N1\nand N2 .\n\u2737\nTheorem 4 If N is a Nijenhuis tensor, then all linear combinations of N k , k =\n0, 1, 2, . . . , are compatible.\nProof.- Indeed, for k \u2265 r,\nN k (A \u25e6N r B) + N r (A \u25e6N k B) =\nN k\u2212r (N r (A)N r (B)) + N r (A) \u25e6N k\u2212r N r (B) =\nN k (A)N r (B) + N r (A)N k (B),\nwhere we have used Theorem 2. Now, the assertion follows from Theorem 3.\n\u2737\nRemark. Let us observe that the product (6) can be obtained from the Nijenhuis\ntensor NK (A) = KA. Indeed,\nA \u25e6NK B = (KA)B + A(KB) \u2212 K(AB) = AKB.\n\n(31)\n\nThe operator NK is a Nijenhuis tensor, since\nNK (A \u25e6NK B) = K(AKB) = (KA)(KB) = NK (A)NK (B).\n\n(32)\n\nIn particular, the operators of multiplication by elements of the field K are Nijenhuis\ntensors. Other examples of Nijenhuis tensors can be constructed in the following way.\nTheorem 5 If A = A1 \u2295 A2 is a decomposition of an associative algebra A (nonunital\nin general) with the multiplication \u03bc into two subalgebras (A with such a decomposition\nis called a twilled algebra) and P1 , P2 denote the corresponding projections of A onto\nA1 and A2 , respectively, then any linear combination N = \u03bb1 P1 + \u03bb2 P2 is a \u03bc-Nijenhuis\ntensor.\nProof.- Since \u03bb1 P1 + \u03bb2 P2 = (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )P1 + \u03bb2 I, it is sufficient to show that P1 is a\n\u03bc-Nijenhuis tensor. Using the decomposition A = A1 + A2 etc., we have\nA \u25e6P1 B = A1 B + AB1 \u2212 (AB)1 ,\n8\n\n(33)\n\n\fso that \u03bcP1 = \u03bc on A1 , \u03bcP1 = 0 on A2 , and\nA1 \u25e6P1 B2 = P2 (A1 B2 ),\n\nA2 \u25e6P1 B1 = P2 (A2 B1 ).\n\n(34)\n\nHence,\nA \u25e6P1 B = A1 B1 + P2 (A1 B2 + A2 B1 )\n\n(35)\n\nP1 (A \u25e6P1 B) = P1 (A1 B1 + P2 (A1 B2 + A2 B1 )) = A1 B1 = P1 (A)P1 (B),\n\n(36)\n\nand\nso that P1 is a Nijenhuis tensor.\n\u0012\n\n\u2737\n\u0013\na b\n.

Of course, this example admits an obvious generalization to algebras of matrices of any dimension. Note also that we can consider these\nproducts at the level of the operator algebra Op(H) over a Hilbert space H directly,\nviewing this algebra as algebra of infinite matrices, or using a decomposition of H into\na direct sum of subspaces, so that we can write operators in a matrix form.\nRemark. Observe that the product (35) is associative even if A2 is not a subalgebra\nbut just a complementary subspace. Indeed,\n(A \u25e6 B) \u25e6 C = (A1 B1 + P2 (A1 B2 + A2 B1 )) \u25e6 C\n= A1 B1 C1 + P2 (A1 B1 C2 + P2 (A1 B2 + A2 B1 )C1 )\n= A1 B1 C1 + P2 (A1 B1 C2 + A1 B2 C1 + A2 B1 C1 ) = A \u25e6 (B \u25e6 C).\nHowever, this product is not of the form \u03bcP1 and it is, in general, not compatible with\nthe original one.\nExample 2. Again, for the matrix algebra A = M2 (K) take A1 = span < I, C >,\nA2 = span < A, B >, where\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1 0\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n.\n(39)\n, I=\n, C=\n, B=\nA=\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n9\n\n\fUsing the Nijenhuis tensor P1 , we get the product\nA \u25e6 B = B \u25e6 A = 0,\nA \u25e6 A = 0,\nB \u25e6 B = 0,\nA \u25e6 C = B,\nC \u25e6 A = \u2212B,\nB \u25e6 C = \u2212A,\nC \u25e6 B = A,\nC \u25e6 C = \u2212I,\nand I remains the unit for this product. The inner derivation associated with C is the\nsame for both products.\nThe product (35) is in fact a contraction of the original one, since\nA \u25e6P1 B = lim Th\u22121 (Th (A)Th (B)),\nh\u21920\n\n(40)\n\nwhere Th (A) = A1 + hA2 . Indeed,\nTh\u22121 (Th (A)Th (B)) = Th\u22121 (A1 B1 + h(A2 B1 + A1 B2 ) + h2 A2 B2 )\n= A1 B1 + P2 (A2 B1 + A1 B2 ) + hP1 (A2 B1 + A1 B2 )\n+hP2 (A2 B2 ) + h2 P1 (A2 B2 )\nwhich tends to A1 B1 + P2 (A2 B1 + A1 B2 ) as h \u2192 0.\nThis can be generalized as follows. Using a decomposition of the algebra A into\nthe direct sum A = A1 \u2295 A2 , where A1 is assumed to be a subalgebra we will write\nA = A1 + A2 for any element A \u2208 A accordingly to this decomposition. Suppose that\nwe have invertible linear operators N1 , N2 acting, respectively, on A1 and A2 . For any\nh \u2208 K we define Th : A \u2192 A by Th (A) = N1 (A1 ) + hN2 (A2 ) and put\nA \u25e6h B = Th\u22121 (Th (A)Th (B)).\n\n(41)\n\nThe product \"\u25e6h \" is clearly associative and\nA \u25e6h B = N1\u22121 (N1 (A1 )N1 (B1 )) +\nN2\u22121 ((N1 (A1 )N2 (B2 ) + N2 (A2 )N1 (B1 ) + hN2 (A2 )N2 (B2 ))2 ) +\nhN1\u22121 ((N1 (A1 )N2 (B2 ) + N2 (A2 )N1 (B1 ) + hN2 (A2 )N2 (B2 ))1 ).\nPassing formally with h \u2192 0, we get the contracted associative product\nA \u25e6 B = N1\u22121 (N1 (A1 )N1 (B1 )) + N2\u22121 ((N1 (A1 )N2 (B2 ) + N2 (A2 )N1 (B1 ))2 ).\n\n(42)\n\nIf we assume that there is an associative product \u25e61 on A1 such that N1 (A1 \u25e61 B1 ) =\nN1 (A1 )N1 (B1 ), then we can write the product (42) in the form\nA \u25e6 B = N1 (A1 ) \u25e61 N1 (B1 ) + N2\u22121 ((N1 (A1 )N2 (B2 ) + N2 (A2 )N1 (B1 ))2 ).\n\n(43)\n\nNow we can skip the assumption that N1 is invertible.

Then, for any invertible linear map\nN2 : A2 \u2192 A2 , the product\nA \u25e6 B = A1 \u25e61 B1 + N2\u22121 ((N1 (A1 )N2 (B2 ) + N2 (A2 )N1\u2032 (B1 ))2 )\n\n(44)\n\nis an associative product on A.\nWe obtain a particular case of the above theorem if we start with a Nijenhuis tensor\nN1 on the subalgebra A1 and we put N1\u2032 = N1 and \u25e61 = \u25e6N1 .\nExample 3. Let A be a matrix algebra, A1 be the subalgebra of diagonal matrices, and\nA2 be the complementary subspace of matrix with 0 on the diagonal. Denote by \u2206(A)\nthe diagonal part of the matrix A. We define N1 : A1 \u2192 A1 to be the multiplication by\nan invertible diagonal matrix K which is a Nijenhuis tensor. We have A \u25e61 B = KAB\nfor diagonal matrices A and B. Finally, putting N1\u2032 = N1 and N2 = I on A2 , we get a\nnew associative product (44)\nA \u25e6 B = K\u2206(A)\u2206(B) + K\u2206(A)(B \u2212 \u2206(B)) + (A \u2212 \u2206(A))K\u2206(B) =\nK\u2206(A)B + AK\u2206(B) \u2212 K\u2206(A)\u2206(B).\n\n(45)\n\nW have used the fact that A2 is invariant with respect to the multiplication by diagonal\nmatrices. Note also, that the above product is not \u03bcK\u2206 since, in general, \u2206(A)\u2206(B) 6=\n\u2206(AB).\nTo construct a Nijenhuis tensor N on A = A1 \u2295 A2 from N1 , we can use the following.\nTheorem 7 If N1 is a Nijenhuis tensor on the subalgebra A1 in the decomposition\nA = A1 \u2295 A2, then N(A) = N1 (A1 ) is a Nijenhuis tensor on A if and only if\nN12 ((A2 B2 )1 ) = 0,\nN1 ((N1 (A1 )B2 )1 \u2212 N1 ((A1 B2 )1 )) = 0,\nN1 ((A2 N1 (B1 ))1 \u2212 N1 ((A2 B1 )1 )) = 0,\n\n(46)\n\nfar all Ai , Bi \u2208 Ai , i = 1, 2.

Let A be the algebra of n \u00d7 n-matrices which are upper-triangular.\nTake A1 to be the commutative subalgebra of diagonal matrices and A2 to be the\n11\n\n\fcomplementary subalgebra of strictly upper-triangular matrices. Put N1 to be the\nmultiplication by a diagonal matrix K from the left. Then N1 is a Nijenhuis tensor on\nA1 which can be extended to the Nijenhuis tensor N(A) = N1 (A1 ) on A. Indeed, in\nthis case A2 is an ideal. The corresponding deformed product has the form\nA \u25e6N B = K\u2206(A)B + AK\u2206(B) \u2212 K\u2206(AB),\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u2206(A) denotes the diagonal part of A.\nLet us recall (cf. [KSM 90]) that a Nijenhuis tensor for a Lie algebra (L, [*, *]) is a linear\nmapping N : L \u2192 L such that N([A, B]N ) = [N(A), N(B)], where\n[A, B]N = [N(A), B] + [A, N(B)] \u2212 N[A, B].\n\n(48)\n\nIt is well known (see e.g. [KSM 90]) that [*, *]N is a compatible Lie bracket if N is\na Nijenhuis tensor. The relation between Nijenhuis tensors in the associative and Lie\nalgebra cases describes the following.\nTheorem 8 If N is a \u03bc-Nijenhuis tensor for an associative algebra (A, \u03bc), then N\nis a Nijenhuis tensor for the Lie algebra (A, [ , ]), where [A, B] = AB \u2212 BA is the\ncommutator, and\n[A, B]N = A \u25e6N B \u2212 B \u25e6N A,\n(49)\ni.e. the deformed Lie bracket [*, *]N is the commutator of the deformed associative product \u25e6N .\nProof.- By definition,\n[A, B]N =\n=\n=\n=\n\n[N(A), B] + [A, N(B)] \u2212 N[A, B]\nN(A)B \u2212 BN(A) + AN(B) \u2212 N(B)A \u2212 N(AB \u2212 BA)\n(N(A)B + AN(B) \u2212 N(AB)) \u2212 (N(B)A + BN(A) \u2212 N(BA))\nA \u25e6N B \u2212 B \u25e6N A.\n\nThen,\nN([A, B]N ) = N(A \u25e6N B \u2212 B \u25e6N A) = N(A)N(B) \u2212 N(B)N(A) = [N(A), N(B)], (50)\ni.e. N is a Lie-Nijenhuis tensor.\n\u2737\nThe above shows that we can apply the well-known theory of Nijenhuis tensors in\nthe Lie algebra case for the 'commutator part' of the associative Nijenhuis tensor to\nconstruct commuting elements etc. On the other hand, it is harder to find associative\nNijenhuis tensors, since vanishing of the Nijenhuis torsion in the Lie algebra case\nN(A \u25e6N B \u2212 B \u25e6N A) = N(A)N(B) \u2212 N(B)N(A)\n\n(51)\n\nrefers only to the skew-symmetrizations (commutators) of the corresponding products.\nSimilarly, [A, B]N = A \u25e6N B \u2212 B \u25e6N A is a Lie bracket if and only if the total skewsymmetrization of the associator\nAssN (A, B, C) = (A \u25e6N B) \u25e6N C \u2212 A \u25e6N (B \u25e6N C)\nvanishes, which is weaker than just vanishing of the associator itself.\n12\n\n(52)\n\n\f4\n\nFinal Examples\n\nExample 5. Let now the algebra A be the algebra of infinite matrices concentrated\nabout the diagonal, i.e. matrices which are null outside a diagonal strip. The algebra\nA represents then unbounded operators on a Hilbert space H with a common dense\ndomain. We choose A1 to be a subalgebra of upper-triangular matrices and for A2 we\ntake the supplementary algebra of strict lower-triangular matrices. Then, the mapping\nN\u03bb (A) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)A1 + \u03bbA\n\n(53)\n\nis a Nijenhuis tensor on A, in view of of Theorem 4, for every \u03bb \u2208 C. Since the\ncorresponding deformed associative products \u25e6\u03bb give all the same result if one of factors\nis a diagonal matrix, the Hamiltonian H for the harmonic oscillator, H(|en i) = n|en i,\ndescribes the same motion for all deformed brackets. This time, however, a\u2020 \u25e6\u03bb a = \u03bbH.\nExample 6. Let us end up with a version of Example 3 for the algebra A of unbounded\noperators as above. Recall that our deformed product is\nA \u25e6 B = K\u2206(A)B + AK\u2206(B) \u2212 K\u2206(A)\u2206(B),\n\n(54)\n\nwhere \u2206(A) is the diagonal part of A. If A is diagonal, then A \u25e6 B = KAB and\nB \u25e6 A = BKA, so that\n[A, B]\u25e6 = [KA, B].\n(55)\nThus the dynamics described by the Heisenberg operator H as above is the same as the\ndynamics described by K \u22121 H with respect to the new product. This time, however,\nthe new product is not compatible with the standard one and we have a\u2020 \u25e6 a = 0.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown that in the Heisenberg picture alternative associative products are\npossible which allow to describe the same dynamics on the space of observables. We\nhope to consider the corresponding version on the phase space via the Wigner map, to\ncompare these findings with those available at the classical level.\n\nReferences\n[Di 48]\n\nDirac, P.A.M., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th ed., Clarendon\nPress, Oxford, 1958.\n\n[DMS 90]\n\nDubrovin, B.
