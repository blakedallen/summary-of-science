An\nimplication of present results for the future JLAB facilities are briefly discussed.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: murat.kaskulov@theo.physik.uni-giessen.de\n\n1\n\n\fExclusive electroproduction of pions in the reaction\ne + N \u2192 e\u2032 + \u03c0 + N \u2032\n\n(1)\n\nat high values of photon virtuality Q2 and invariant mass W of produced hadronic final state\nprovides an interesting tool to study a space-times pattern of partonic interactions in deep\ninelastic scattering (DIS). It may further reveal the partonic substructure of participating\nhadrons, correlating the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by quarks to transverse\ncoordinates. This latter property of the hard exclusive reaction N(e, e\u2032 \u03c0)N \u2032 follows from\nthe QCD factorization theorem which was proven for hard Q2 \u226b \u039b2QCD electroproduction\nof mesons by longitudinal photons \u03b3L\u2217 [1]. Predictions for the production by transverse virtual photons \u03b3T\u2217 are absent as no factorization theorem has been proven for such photons.\nHowever, their contribution to the cross section is expected to be suppressed by at least a\npower of 1/Q2 . On the other hand, above the resonance region W 2 > 4 GeV2 the exclusive reaction (\u03b3 \u2217 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) with charged pions provides an important information concerning the\nelectromagnetic form factor of the pion at momentum transfer Q2 much bigger than in the\ndirect scattering of pions from atomic electrons [2].\nExperimentally, the differential cross sections in the exclusive reaction p(\u03b3 \u2217 , \u03c0 + )n has\nbeen measured above the resonance region at CEA [3], Cornell [4], DESY [5], and recently\nat JLAB [6]. At JLAB a separation of cross sections into different transverse and longitudinal\ncomponents has been done. The HERMES data at DESY [7] largely extend the kinematic\nregion to much higher values of W toward the true DIS region Q2 \u226b 1 GeV2 and much\nhigher values of \u2212t. Theoretically, there is a long standing issue concerning the reaction\nmechanisms contributing to the single pion N(e, e\u2032 \u03c0)N \u2032 production at high energies and\nphoton virtualities. Just above the resonance region around the onset of the deep inelastic\nregime the models describing the exclusive pion production p(e, e\u2032 \u03c0 + )n in terms of hadronic\ndegrees of freedom fail to reproduce the large transverse cross section \u03c3T observed in this\nreaction. For instance, the hadron-exchange models which are generally considered to be a\nguideline for the experimental analysis and extraction of the pion form factor, underestimate\ngrossly \u03c3T at the highest values of Q2 measured at JLAB [6]. While, the longitudinal cross\nsection \u03c3L was supposed to be well understood in terms of the pion quasi-elastic knockout\nmechanism [8]. This is because of the pion pole at low \u2212t. Even at smaller DESY [5]\nand much higher Cornell [4] values of Q2 there is a disagreement between model calculations\n2\n\n\fbased on the hadron-exchange scenario and experimental data. Another interesting example\nis the neutral pion production. In \u03c0 0 photoproduction the cross section is well described\nat high energies by exchange of Regge poles in the t-channel, with \u03c9 and \u03c1 the dominant\ntrajectories. This gives a natural explanation of the diffractive dip in the differential cross\nsection at \u2212t \u2243 0.6 GeV2 provided a wrong signature zero is accounted for in the Regge\namplitudes. However, already at low values of Q2 the experimental data indicate a sudden\nchange in the reaction dynamics which washes out the diffractive dip. The nature of this\ntransition is not fully understood within Regge phenomenology.\nA possible solution of the \u03c3T problem at JLAB was proposed in Ref. [9]. The approach\nfollowed there is to complement the hadron-like interaction types in the t-channel, which\ndominate in photoproduction and low Q2 electroproduction, by a direct interaction of virtual\nphotons with partons followed by string (quark) fragmentation into \u03c0 + n. Then \u03c3T can\nbe readily explained and both \u03c3L and \u03c3T can be described from low up to high values\nof Q2 . In [9] the reaction p(e, e\u2032 \u03c0 + )n is treated as the exclusive limit, z \u2192 1, of the semiinclusive reaction p(e, e\u2032 \u03c0 + )X in DIS in the spirit of the exclusive-inclusive connection [10]. A\nsuggestion concerning the partonic contribution to the exclusive reaction N(e, e\u2032 \u03c0)N \u2032 follows\nthe arguments in [11] where it has been shown that the typical exclusive photoproduction\nmechanisms involving a peripheral quark-antiquark pair in the proton wave function, the\nt-channel meson-exchange processes, should be unimportant in the transverse response \u03c3T\n> 1 GeV2 and play no role in the true deep inelastic region.\nalready around Q2 \u223c\nIn this brief report we apply the two-component hadron-parton model proposed in Ref. [9]\nfor the description of recent HERMES data in order to check its validity in a different\nkinematic regime. We use the same model parameters as in [9]. In the model of [9] the hadron\nexchange part is described by exchange of Regge trajectories. In the reaction p(\u03b3 \u2217 , \u03c0 + )n we\ntake into account the exchange of \u03c0(140) and \u03c1(770)-meson Regge trajectories. The former\none includes the electric part of the nucleon-pole contribution to conserve the charge of\nthe system [12]. The partonic part is shown schematically in Figure 1. It is a DIS like\nelectroproduction mechanism where the quark knockout reaction \u03b3 \u2217 q \u2192 q is followed by\nthe fragmentation process of the Lund type [13]. We refer to [9] for further details. We\nrecall that at JLAB kinematics the transverse cross section is dominated by the mechanism\ndescribed in Figure 1. As a result the transverse cross section is large and at forward angles\nis comparable with the longitudinal cross section. As we shall see at HERMES, where the\n3\n\n\fvalue of W is much larger, the transverse cross section gets much smaller at forward angles\nas compared to JLAB and the cross section is dominated by exchange of Regge trajectories.\nHowever, the situation is different in the off-forward region. Because of the exponential falloff of Regge contributions as a function of \u2212t the meson-exchange processes are negligible\nin the region of \u2212t > 1 GeV2 . In this region the interaction of virtual photon with partons\ngives the dominant contribution.\n\n\u03c0\n\nq\nq\n\ne\n\nq\n\ne\n\nq\n\n\u03b3 q\n\nN\n\nq\n\nN\nFIG. 1: (Color online) A schematic representation of the deeply virtual partonic part of the \u03c0electroproduction mechanism. See the text for the details.\n\nAt first, a brief discussion concerning some features of HERMES data is in order. The\ndifferential cross section in the exclusive reaction p(e, e\u2032 \u03c0 + )n can be written in the following\nform\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u03c0\u03a6\nd\u03c3T\nd\u03c3L\nd\u03c3\n,\n=\n+\u03b5\n2\ndQ d\u03bddt\nEe (Ee \u2212 \u03bd) dt\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the virtual photon flux is given by [14]\n\u03a6=\n\n\u03b1 Ee \u2212 \u03bd K 1\n,\n2\u03c0 2 Ee Q2 1 \u2212 \u03b5\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2243 1/137, K = \u03bd(1 \u2212 xB ), \u03bd = Ee \u2212 Ee\u2032 and\n\u03b5=\n\n1\n\u03bd 2 + Q2\n1+2\n4Ee (Ee \u2212 \u03bd) \u2212 Q2\n\n(4)\n\nis the ratio of longitudinal to transverse polarization of the virtual photon and other notations are obvious. At HERMES the kinematic requirement Q2 > 1 GeV2 has been imposed\non the scattered lepton in order to select the hard scattering regime. The resulting kinematic range is 1 < Q2 < 11 GeV2 and 0.02 < xB < 0.55 for the Bjorken variable. The\n4\n\n\fmeasured cross sections are integrated over the azimuthal angle \u03c6 and a separation of the\ntransverse and longitudinal parts was not feasible. Furthermore, the exclusive data were obtained from \u03c0 + semi-inclusive DIS data by using a model dependent subtraction procedure.\nWith Ee = 27.6 GeV beam energy at DESY the ratio of longitudinal to transverse polarization of the virtual photon \u03b5 is high \u03b5 \u2243 0.95. Contrary to JLAB where \u03b5 is smaller the\nlongitudinal cross section at HERMES enters the differential cross section with practically\nits full strength. The value of s = W 2 was required to be higher than 10 GeV2 . To make\na proper comparison with data the theoretical cross sections have to be corrected for the\nbin size effect to account for the Q2 and xB dependence of the exclusive \u03c0 + yield within the\nHERMES acceptance. The corresponding experimental distributions of \u03c0 + as a function of\nQ2 (left) and xB (right) are shown in Figure 2 and are used to generate the virtual photon\nflux in the Monte Carlo procedure to fold the theoretical cross sections.\nOur results for the photon-nucleon differential cross section d\u03c3 = d\u03c3T + \u03b5d\u03c3L in the\nreaction p(\u03b3 \u2217 , \u03c0 + )n at HERMES are shown in Figure 3.

The solid curves are the model\nresults. The dash-dotted curves correspond to the exchange of \u03c0-Regge trajectory and dash-dashdotted curves to the exchange of \u03c1-Regge trajectory. The histograms and the dashed curves which\njust fit the histograms describe the partonic contributions in line of the DIS mechanism shown in\nFigure 1. The dot-dot-dashed curves are the contribution of the transverse cross section d\u03c3T /dt to\nthe total unseparated response d\u03c3/dt.\n\nand xB . Different panels in Figure 3 correspond to different Q2 and xB bins. The model\nresults which include both the hadron-exchange and partonic DIS contributions are shown\nby the solid curves. We obtain satisfactory agreement with data for first three (Q2 , xB ) bins\nand underestimate the cross section for the last bin with the highest values of Q2 . Although\nwith the model parameters at hand a perfect description of data can be achieved, we do\nnot attempt to fit the data and use the same model parameters tuned to JLAB data. We\nrecall again that the experimental data themselves include a model dependent background\nsubtraction uncertainties.\nConcerning different contributions to the cross section, in Figure 3 the dash-dotted curves\n6\n\n\fcorrespond to the exchange of \u03c0-Regge trajectory and dash-dash-dotted curves to the exchange of \u03c1-Regge trajectory. All the trajectories used here are linear. The histograms and\ndashed curves which just fit the histograms describe the hard partonic contributions in line\nof the DIS mechanism shown in Figure 1, see for the details Ref. [9]. As one can see, at forward angles the \u03c0-exchange dominates the differential cross sections. The steep fall of d\u03c3/dt\naway from forward angles comes entirely from the rapidly decreasing \u03c0-exchange amplitude.\nThe \u03c0-exchange contributes mainly to the longitudinal response \u03c3L and at low momentum\ntransfer \u2212t the variation of the cross section with Q2 falls down as the electromagnetic form\nfactor of the pion \u03c3L \u221d (F\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 (Q2 ))2\nF\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 (Q2 ) = (1 + Q2 /\u039b2\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 )\u22121 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe value of the cut-off in Eq. (5) used in the calculations is \u039b2\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 = 0.52 GeV2 . This\nis an optimal value needed to describe the JLAB data in the present model for values of\n> 1.5 GeV2 . The magnitude of the cross section and slope of solid curves and data at\nQ2 \u223c\nvery forward angles are consistent with the Regge behavior\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3/dt \u223c e2\u03b1\u03c0 ln(s/s0 )(t\u2212m\u03c0 )\u22122 ln(s/s0 ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u03c0\u2032 = 0.7 GeV\u22122 and s0 = 1 GeV2 . The contribution of the \u03c1-exchange is marginal in\n\u03c3L and \u03c3T .\nAt large \u2212t the model cross section points mainly toward the direct coupling of the\nvirtual photons to partons. Indeed, this is rather natural, since with increasing \u2212t at fixed\nQ2 smaller distances can accordingly be accessed. This is opposed to t-channel mesonexchange processes which involve peripheral production of \u03c0 + and therefore large distances\nfrom the origin. At forward angles the DIS contribution (histograms in Figure 1) to the\ncross section is by two orders of magnitude smaller than the meson-exchange contributions.\nHowever, the slope of the cross section in this case is also much smaller. Note that, in the\nmodel of Ref. [9] the partonic part is transverse and its behavior (slope) at forward angles\nis driven by the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of partons hkT2 i. From the fit to\nthe histograms (dashed curves) we observe a slight decrease of the slope as a function of Q2\nbut it is essentially the same as at JLAB energies. The partonic DIS part of the cross section\nshows a rather weak Q2 dependence and has approximately the same order of magnitude\nfor all Q2 bins.

In the latter work the pion form factor has been modified\nto account for different space-time patterns of hard interaction processes. However, there\nis an important difference. By modifying the off-mass-shell behavior of F\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 (Q2 ) at large\n\u2212t, see Eq. (5) with \u039b\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u039b\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 (t, Q2 ), one essentially modifies the dominant longitudinal\ncomponent and absorbs the partonic contributions in \u03c3L . Our interpretation relies on DIS\nlike \u03b3 \u2217 q \u2192 q interaction which shows up in the transverse response \u03c3T as in any high (Q2 , W )\nDIS processes.\nThe considerable reduction of the transverse exclusive cross section as a function of W\nobserved here has important consequences for the future JLAB facilities. For instance, in\nFigure 4 we show the longitudinal hadronic and transverse partonic cross sections at values\nof Q2 = 1.5 GeV2 and for two different values of W = 2 GeV and 3 GeV. The transverse cross\n\n8\n\n\fsection (top histogram) at present JLAB energies (W = 2 GeV) is large in agreement with\ndata and at forward directions is comparable in order of magnitude with the longitudinal\ncross section (dashed curve). An increase of W just from 2 GeV to 3 GeV reduces the\ntransverse DIS cross section by about two orders of magnitude. However, the longitudinal\ncross section is barely changed. This may support QCD based calculations which rely on\nsmall transverse components in an extraction of nucleon's GPD. This example also shows\nthat at JLAB with 12 GeV electron beam an extraction of the pion charge form factor from\nforward exclusive electroproduction data will not be contaminated by the large transverse\nnon-pole background contributions. Furthermore, at these energies the theoretical analysis\nand proof of the color transparency signal observed in semi-exclusive (e, e\u2032 \u03c0 + ) off nuclei will\nbe considerably simplified [16, 17].\nIn summary, we applied the model of Ref. [9] to recent HERMES data on exclusive \u03c0 +\nelectroproduction in the deep inelastic region. The data were obtained at much higher values\nof Q2 and W as compared to the previous data from JLAB. We find that the transverse cross\nsection, which is large at JLAB, gets much smaller at HERMES. However, with increasing\n\u2212t the role of partonic DIS mechanisms becomes more pronounced. We also find that the\nforward production of \u03c0 + at HERMES is dominated by exchange of Regge poles, with \u03c0\nbeing the dominance trajectory. On the contrary, the off-forward region with \u2212t > 1 GeV2\nis dominated by partonic interactions describing the direct coupling of virtual photons to\nconstituents of the nucleon. For future JLAB energies the model predicts a tiny transverse\ncomponent which might be important for the GPD interpretation of p(\u03b3 \u2217 , \u03c0 + )n as well as\nin the extraction of the pion form factor from the forward electroproduction data.\nWe are grateful to Dr. A.
