NMR and new hot subject of research spintronics). Although\nthe mathematical formulation (Lie algebra) of the subject is well-known, the fundamental\ndiscussions related to the spin can be hardly found in modern (text)books and papers. In\nthis letter, with an overview of the fundamental origins of Klein-Gordon and Dirac\nequations, Thomas precession, and the photon spin, it is pointed out that the origin of spin\nangular momentum refers to relativity than quantum theory.\nAs is clear in the history of the discovery of the electron spin [1], spin degree of freedom\ncannot be considered as the electron rotation. If the electron is to rotate around itself, its\nsurface velocity should be more than the velocity of light in vacuum?! Although some\nexperts have tried to find a realistic and causal model for spin angular momentum [2],\nthey haven't succeeded to satisfy the physics society yet; the reason is that the so-called\nclassical models are \"toy\" models than be considered realistic.\nIn 1926, Klein [3] and Gordon [4] found a relativistic generalization of Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation which could remain invariant under Lorentz transformations. Possibility of\nfinding negative probability density in Klein-Gordon equation made Dirac search for\nanother relativistic version of Schr\u00f6dinger equation. He found a first order equation\nwhich is invariant under Lorentz transformations. Dirac equation could remove negative\nprobability density and simultaneously contains spin with no postulates. Since Dirac aim\nwas not to find spin and just wanted to reach a relativistic equation and since in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which is based on Schr\u00f6dinger equation, one can only\ninclude spin quantity by hand (based on Pauli approach), it seems the relativistic\nconsideration/generalization is the main origin of leading to spin degree of freedom.\nIn the same year (1926), Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit, who had introduced the idea of\nelectron spin for the first time, showed that if the electron had a g factor of 2, the\nanomalous Zeeman Effect could be explained correctly. In 1927, Thomas showed that the\nreason for a g factor of 2 ( g e \uf03d 2) originated from a relativistic kinematical effect [5].\n(Note: Now, the g factor value and its origin can be explained and computed based on\nmodern relativistic quantum field theory). This fact that the Thomas work was based on\nrelativistic corrections confirms this idea that spin has relativistic origin.\nIn classical electrodynamics the total angular momentum of a distribution of\nelectromagnetic fields in vacuum can be written in the form [6]:\n\n\uf072\n\uf072\n\uf072 \uf072\n\uf072\n\uf0e9\uf072 \uf072 3\n\uf0f9 \uf072 \uf072\n1\n1\n3\n3\nJ\uf03d\nd\nx\nX\n\uf0b4\n(\nE\n\uf0b4\nB\n)\n\uf03d\nd\nx\n\uf0ea E \uf0b4 A \uf02b \uf0e5 E j ( X \uf0b4 \uf0d1) A j \uf0fa \uf03d S \uf02b L\n\uf0f2\n\uf0f2\n4\uf070c\n4\uf070c\nj \uf03d1\n\uf0eb\n\uf0fb\n\n(1)\n\nThe first term is an intrinsic position-independent expression; but, the second term\ndepends on the position. The Hermitian quantized (operatorial) form of the first term is:\n\n2\n\n\f\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf072\n\uf072 \uf072\n\uf072 \uf072\n1\nS\uf03d\nd 3 x [ E \uf0b4 A] \uf02d [ A \uf0b4 E ]\n\uf0f2\n8\uf070c Vol\n\n(2)\n\nFourier expansion of vector potential operator leads to [7]:\n\uf072\n\uf0e6k \uf0f6\n\uf0e5 (\uf068m)a a k\uf072m \uf0e7\uf0e7 k \uf0f7\uf0f7\nk m \uf03d \uf02b1,1\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n\uf072\n\uf072 \uf02b\n\uf0e6k \uf0f6 \uf02b\n\uf0de S \uf028a k\uf072m \uf03d \uf0b11 0 \uf029 \uf03d (\uf0b11\uf068 )\uf0e7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0f7(a k\uf072m \uf03d \uf0b11 0 )\n\uf0e8k\uf0f8\n\uf072\nS \uf03d\uf0e5\n\uf072\n\n\uf02b\n\uf072\nkm\n\n(3)\n\nFourier coefficients are creation and annihilation operators and have no m \uf03d 0\n\uf072\ncomponent. The photon spin vector has projections along the direction of the k vector of\n\uf02b 1\uf068 (right circularly polarized photons) or of \uf02d 1\uf068 (left circularly polarized photons).\nAlthough the spin number of photon is s \uf03d 1, there aren't 2s \uf02b 1 \uf03d 3 states available; this\nis due to the fact that photon has no rest mass and no rest frame.\nOnce again and based on the above argument on the electromagnetic field which is a\npurely relativistic field whose quantum particle is photon, it is deduced that the spin\nwhich is an intrinsic (position-independent) kind of angular momentum has relativistic\norigin.\nWe should also mention that even by considering modern quantum theory of fields for\nstudying the subject through spin-statistics theorem, relativistic considerations are of\ngreat importance; this is because the spin-statistics theorem is proved by means of microcausality (micro-locality) relations whose origins are in relativity than quantum theory.\nIn conclusion, spin isn't a pure quantum mechanical quantity but it has relativistic origin.\nIt seems it is better to call spin as the\"rest angular momentum\".\n\nComment and Acknowledgement:\nH.
