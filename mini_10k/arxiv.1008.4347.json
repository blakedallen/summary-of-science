Most commonly, the brightnesses and colors of the stellar population have been compared with isochrones to check our understanding\nof how stars of nearly the same age and chemical composition evolve. Unfortunately, observational and theoretical issues prevent highly accurate measurements of desirable quantities like\nage. For example, convection and color-Teff relations present notorious problems in modeling the light emitted by stellar populations. Degeneracies in distance, interstellar reddening,\nchemical composition greatly complicate efforts to measure ages as well (Southworth et al.\n2004, e.g.).\nThe different methods of deriving information about the stars in a population can magnify each other. The analysis of eclipsing binary stars can provide accurate mass and radius\ninformation on a subset of the stars, and when used in conjunction with colors and brightnesses, this can help to \"pin down\" theoretical isochrones at a number of locations. This\nimmensely increases the constricting power of the observations. Asteroseismology can provide accurate mean densities for individual stars and holds promise of revealing details of\ntheir internal structure. But again, when these observation can be used with color-magnitude\ndiagram information the power of the tests are magnified.\nStar clusters in the field of the Kepler satellite promise to become important laboratories\nfor stellar astronomy because of the range of observations that can be brought to bear to\ntest theoretical models. Asteroseismological oscillations have already been detected in giant\nstars in the cluster NGC 6819 (Stello et al. 2010), and efforts are on to detect them among\nfainter stars. This paper is the start of our attempt to identify detached eclipsing binary\nstars in this same cluster. Kepler will provide light curves of unprecedented accuracy that\nwill greatly improve the precision of radius measurements for stars in the cluster, but to make\nfull use of the binary systems, we also need temperature information that will come from\nobservations in narrower wavelength bands. In turn, masses for turnoff stars will help directly\nconstrain the low-mass end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation (Kalirai et al. 2001;\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWilliams et al. 2009, e.g.), which in turn impacts chemical enrichment and white dwarf\ncooling studies.\nNGC 6819 is a moderately old cluster (\u223c 2.5 Gyr; Rosvick & Vandenberg 1998; Kalirai et al.\n2001) with near-solar or slightly super-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]= +0.09\u00b10.03; Bragaglia et al.\n2001). Variability studies have been presented previously for NGC 6819 by Kaluzny & Shara\n(1988), Street et al. (2002), and Street et al. (2005). The wider surveys of Hartman et al.\n(2004) and Pigulski et al. (2009) also covered large portions of the Kepler field as part of\nthe Hungarian-made Automated Telescope network (HATnet) project and the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS), respectively. Both the HATnet and ASAS surveys had low spatial\nresolution (14\u2032\u2032 and 15\u2032\u2032 per pixel) and were relatively shallow, so there is no overlap with\nthe variables we discuss below. Kaluzny & Shara (1988) were searching for short period\ncontact binaries in the cluster, and their observing program only involved two nights. Even\nso they identified three possible variables, two of which we have confirmed. (The third,\nwhich corresponds to star A81, was not seen to vary in our datasets.) In a series of papers,\nStreet et al. identified a large number of variables in and near the cluster as a byproduct\nof a planet search. Their exposures resulted in saturation for stars with V . 16.5, which is\nfainter than the cluster turnoff. There was therefore a distinct possibility that undetected\ndetached eclipsing variables were present in the cluster.\nWhile characterization of the eclipsing binaries is our primary goal, accurate and precise stellar photometry needs to be of complementary quality. Auner (1974) presented the\nfirst wide field photographic photometry of NGC 6819, while the primary CCD photometry has been published by Rosvick & Vandenberg (1998) and Kalirai et al. (2001). The\nphotometry in this study covers a slightly larger field and goes slightly fainter than that of\nRosvick & Vandenberg (1998). By contrast, Kalirai et al.'s study covered a much wider field\nand went deep enough to identify the cluster's white dwarf sequence.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nNGC 6819 was observed using two different telescopes. Some of us (J.L.C., R.M.R,\nD.D.B) observed the cluster for 10 consecutive nights using the 1.8 meter Plaskett Telescope\nat Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (hereafter, DAO) between July 5-15, 2001 (although\nweather compromised most of the night of July 7). These images were taken using a Cousins\nR filter (hereafter RC ) and lasted for a total of 180 s each. The field of view, spanning a\n0\n\nIdentification numbers in this paper that start with \"A\" come from the photometric study by Auner\n(1974).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntotal area of 9.\u2032 2 \u00d7 9.\u2032 2. A 1024\u00d71024 CCD was used, and pixels were binned 2 \u00d7 2, for a final\n1.\u2032\u2032 1 per pixel. 16 nights of data were taken at the Mount Laguna Observatory (hereafter,\nMLO) 1 m telescope (by A.T. and E.L.S.) covering an area approximately 13.\u2032 5 \u00d7 13.\u2032 5 ,\nfor a scale of about 0.\u2032\u2032 4 per pixel. and are listed in Table 1. For eleven of the nights\nthe exposures were taken using a V filter and typically lasted 90 s each. The remaining six\nnights of observations used a Kron R filter (hereafter RK , which has a passband similar to the\ncombination of Cousins R and I) and again each exposure was typically 90 s. Two additional\nnights of observations were taken at MLO for the purpose of calibrating the photometry to\nthe standard system. For both the DAO and MLO datasets, the seeing typically produced a\nFWHM of stellar images around 2 \u2212 2.5 arcsec. Image reduction (overscan subtraction, bias\nsubtraction, and flat field correction) was done using standard tools in IRAF1 .\nDifferential photometry was undertaken using the image subtraction package ISIS (Alard\n2000). ISIS is commonly used in variability studies today, thanks to its ability to detect\nvariability at near the Poisson noise limit. Our image sets in V , RC , and RK filters were\ninterpolated to a common image coordinate system (separately for the DAO and MLO\ndatasets), and then processed separately by filter. This involved producing a reference\nimage from approximately 20 images with the best seeing; subtracting each interpolated\nimage from the reference image once the reference was transformed to the seeing of the\ninterpolated image (and a constant flux scaling is enforced); stacking the subtracted images\nto identify stars whose detected flux had changed; and taking photometric measurements of\nthe subtracted image. While ISIS has the capability of breaking images into subimages and\nanalyzing the point-spread function separately on each subimage, we found that using whole\nimages produced better results for our datasets.\nSeveral routines of the ISIS code do not function optimally, however. The ISIS code uses\na bicubic spline to interpolate each image to the coordinate system set by an astrometric\nreference image. Bicubic splines are subject to spurious oscillations near sharp features\nthough, so we replaced the bicubic spline with an Akima spline. This reduced noise that had\nbeen introduced by saturated stars and diffraction spikes, but also improved the interpolation\nof the images of bright stars on images with good seeing.\nThe output of ISIS is a difference flux measured on the subtracted images. To convert\nthese difference fluxes into magnitudes, the star's flux must be measured on the reference\nframe. For crowded star fields, this should ideally be done using a technique like profile fitting\n1\n\nIRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under\ncontract with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthat is capable of accurate photometry in the limit of strongly overlapping star images. An\nimportant issue is that a flux derived in that way is not guaranteed to be on the same scale\nas the ISIS difference flux (Hartman et al. 2004), and if it is not, this will directly affect the\namplitude of derived light curves. For our datasets, we found that a reference flux derived\nfrom ISIS' own photometry routine was a reliable choice. We are principally interested in\nensuring that our differential photometry is accurate because this affects the reliability of\nstellar sizes computed from light curve analysis. To this end, we subtracted our aperture\nphotometry results from ISIS photometry point-by-point for a selection of eclipsing binary\nstars that were not affected by blending issues. When done, it was impossible to distinguish\nbetween points in or out of eclipses.\nISIS' algorithm is a modified aperture photometry routine that employs the reference\nimage point-spread function (PSF) for weighting purposes. The reference PSF is first transformed to the seeing of the image under consideration. Only the portion within an aperture\nof radphot pixels is used, but it is normalized to a larger aperture of rad aper pixels. The\npixel values in the subtracted image are weighted by this transformed PSF. For the MLO\ndatasets, we used radphot = 4 pix and rad aper = 10 pixels. For the DAO images (which\nhad pixels with larger area on the sky), we used radphot = 2 pix and rad aper = 7. The\nphotometry routine requires coordinate lists for the the stars to be measured - both centroid\nand pixel with maximum counts. As written, ISIS uses the pixel with maximum counts as\nthe center of the apertures. It should be noted that the ISIS starts its pixel coordinate system\nat x = y = 0, unlike many astronomical software packages, and this should be accounted for\nif producing a coordinate list outside of ISIS' routines.\nFinder charts for the detected variables are shown in Fig. 1.\n\n2.1.\n\nPhotometric Calibration\n\nWe took calibration images under photometric conditions on the night of 25 October\n2008. We observed the standard fields PG0231+051, SA 92, SA95, SA 98, and NGC 6940,\nand used standard values taken from Stetson (2000, retrieved August 2009). The standard\nfields were observed between 3 and 10 times per filter in BV I at airmasses that ranged from\n1.034 to 1.998. All together this resulted in more than 4000 standard star observations per\nfilter covering a color range \u22120.5 . (B \u2212 I) . 5.\nWe derived aperture photometry from all frames using DAOPHOT, and made curve of\ngrowth corrections using the program DAOGROW. The observations were transformed to\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe standard system using the following equations:\nb = B + a0 + a1 (B \u2212 I) + a2 X\nv = V + b0 + b1 (B \u2212 I) + b2 X\ni = I + c0 + c1 (B \u2212 I) + c2 X\nwhere b, v, and i are instrumental magnitudes, B, V , and I are standard-system magnitudes,\nX is airmass, and ai , bi , and ci are coefficients determined from least-squares fits. For the\ncolor coefficients, we found a1 = \u22120.0208 \u00b1 0.0018, b1 = 0.0367 \u00b1 0.0007, and c1 = \u22120.0066 \u00b1\n0.0006. The extinction coefficients were a2 = 0.233 \u00b1 0.004, b2 = 0.129 \u00b1 0.005, and c2 =\n0.064 \u00b1 0.007. Fig. 2 shows the residuals of the comparison of our standardized observations\nand the Stetson values.\nClusters to be calibrated were observed with a range of exposures times on the same\nnight. For NGC 6819, there were 8 observations in B (1 \u00d7 30 s, 2 \u00d7 60 s, 2 \u00d7 120 s, 2 \u00d7 180\ns, and 1 \u00d7 300 s), 9 observations in V (2 \u00d7 10 s, 2 \u00d7 60 s, 4 \u00d7 120 s, and 1 \u00d7 300 s), and 11\nobservations in I (4 \u00d7 10 s, 1 \u00d7 60 s, 5 \u00d7 120 s, and 1 \u00d7 300 s).\nFigure 3 shows a comparison of our photometry with that of Rosvick & Vandenberg\n(1998), as downloaded from the WEBDA database. It should be noted that Rosvick & Vandenberg\ndid not present the details of the IC observations or reduction in their article, Overall there\nis no sign of color-dependent residuals and there is very good agreement in zeropoints, with\nthe most noticeable difference being a relatively large zeropoint difference in IC . The colormagnitude diagram for our field is shown in Fig. 4.\n\n2.2.\n\nSpectra\n\nOur spectra were obtained at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) with the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS, Tull 1998) as part of normal queue scheduled observing (Shetrone et al.\n2007). HRS was configured to HRS 30k central 316g5936 2as 0sky IS0 GC0 2x3 or HRS 30k central 600g5\nto achieve R=30,000 spectra covering 4100\u00c5 to 7800\u00c5 or 4825\u00c5 to 6750\u00c5 respectively. Exposure times ranged from 600 seconds to 1200 seconds. The signal-to-noise was typically 25\nper resolution element at 5800 \u00c5.\nThe spectra were reduced with IRAF ECHELLE scripts. The standard IRAF scripts for\noverscan removal, bias subtraction, flat fielding and scattered light removal were employed.\nFor the HRS flat field we masked out the Li I, H I and Na D regions because the HET HRS\nflat field lamp suffered from faint emission lines. The spectra were combined into a single\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nlong spectrum for the blue and red chips. Radial velocities were determined from crosscorrelation using the IRAF task fxcor using a solar spectrum as template. The heliocentric\ncorrection was made using the IRAF task rvcorrect.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nPulsating Star A20pe\n\nThis star2 has identification number 107 in the proper motion study of Sanders (1972),\nwhich gives it a 90% probability of membership. It is as bright in V as stars in the red clump\nfor the cluster, but is bluer than the cluster turnoff. A20pe is therefore a likely cluster blue\nstraggler.\nThe star has low-amplitude short period variation that identifies it as a \u03b4 Scu pulsating\nvariable. As such, it should be within the instability strip. We transformed the theoretical\ninstability strip boundaries of Pamyatnykh (2000) to the observational plane using color-Teff\nrelations from VandenBerg & Clem (2003), and E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10 and (m \u2212 M)V = 12.30\n(Kalirai et al. 2001). Based on this, the star appears to be too blue and/or bright. It\nis possible that the star could have a companion that is putting it out of the strip - a\ndirect analog to this idea exists in the blue straggler EX Cnc in M67, which is an eccentric\nspectroscopic binary of 4.2 d period containing a \u03b4 Scuti variable (Milone & Latham 1992).\nHowever, in this case, the companion star would have to be hotter and more massive than\nthe \u03b4 Scu star, implying that there would be two stars in a binary that would be identified\nas blue stragglers on their own. Radial velocities would be helpful in verifying the star's\nmembership in the cluster, and if a member, helping to identify its formation mechanism.\n\n3.2.\n\nContact or Near-Contact Binaries\n\nPhased light curves for some of the short-period eclipsing binaries are shown in Fig. 6.\nWhere possible, the photometry presented in Table 2 has been corrected to system maximum\nvalues. Most of these systems were previously identified by Street et al. (2002), and so we\nfocus here on new systems and unusual properties of the known systems that have not been\n2\n\nThis is photoelectric standard 20 in Auner (1974), not part of his photographic photometry list. The\nidentifications of this star seem to be confused in the WEBDA database. This is star 36 in the photometry\nof Rosvick & Vandenberg (1998), but that star is incorrectly identified with star 168 in the Sanders (1972)\nproper motion study.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndiscussed before.\nBefore discussing those, we attempted to estimate likelihood of membership using the\ncolor-luminosity relationship for W UMa variable stars from Rucinski & Duerbeck (1997):\nMV = \u22124.44 log P + 3.02(B \u2212 V )0 + 0.12\nand then comparing the implied distance modulus to the one derived from isochrone fitting.\n(B \u2212 V )0 is the dereddened color of the system at maximum brightness. Kalirai et al.\n(2001) derived a distance modulus (m \u2212 M)V = 12.30 \u00b1 0.12 and assumed a reddening\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10. Given the uncertainty in the distance modulus and the observed scatter\nof 0.22 mag in the Rucinski & Duerbeck (1997) relationship, V2396 Cyg [(m\u2212M)V = 12.26],\nV2388 Cyg (12.53) are probable cluster members, while A355 (11.47) and V2389 Cyg (14.39)\nare not. We discuss the special case WOCS 013016 immediately below.\nWOCS 013016: This is a new detection because it was too bright for the variability\nsurveys by Street et al. (2002, 2005) and was outside the field studied by Kaluzny & Shara\n(1988). The V photometry presented in Table 2 has been corrected to maximum system\nbrightness, but the colors are somewhat less accurate - our calibration observations occurred\nnear, but not at maximum light.\nThe system has identification number 46 in the proper motion study of Sanders (1972),\nwhich gives it a 80% probability of membership. If we apply the Rucinski & Duerbeck (1997)\nperiod-luminosity-color (PLC) relationship here, we calculate (m \u2212 M)V = 12.38, in very\ngood agreement with the cluster distance modulus. However, WOCS 013016 has a period\nthat is significantly longer than the probable cluster EW systems that we detected, and its\nlight curve more closely resembles those of EB systems. Rucinski & Duerbeck (1997) discuss the application of their period-luminosity-color (PLC) relationship to EW systems that\nappear to be in poor thermal contact (in other words, having eclipses of significantly different depths, implying significant differences in the surface temperatures of the components).\nThey indicate that the PLC relationship should produce luminosity estimates that are too\nhigh. As long as the biases are not too large (. 0.3 mag), the distance modulus for WOCS\n013016 supports its membership in the cluster.\nIf it is a member, then it should be identified as a blue straggler that is probably in the\nprocess of coalescing. To be as blue as it is currently, there must have been an earlier merger\nor significant mass transfer to have produced the more massive component of the binary.\nA355 (WOCS 052004): This variable is brighter than the saturation limit for images\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ntaken by Street et al. (2002), but was detected earlier by Kaluzny & Shara (1988).3 This binary system is probably in contact, but it shows unusually severe distortions to its light curve,\nas seen in Fig. 7. Similar behavior was seen also in V and RK filter bands with a different\ntelescope/camera set-up years later, so this behavior is very likely to be real and ongoing.\nFor example, in several cases in the figure (and on the nights HJD 2454697 to 2454699),\nthe photometric maximum is found as much as 0.1 cycle away from the expected position,\nand it shifts significantly from night to night. In other cases (HJDs 2452103 and 2452105\nin the figure, as well as HJDs 2454624 and 2454669), one of the photometric maximums\nwas almost completely truncated, to the point of making the system superficially resemble\na detached eclipsing binary of nearly spherical stars. Before and after night 2452103, the\nsystem showed some of its deepest eclipses and showed variations identifying it as an EW\nsystem with gravitationally distorted stars of nearly equal temperature. In nearly all cases\nwhere we can compare phases 0.5 apart on the same night, the light curves imply the system\nis nearly point symmetric about the center of the orbits, but not symmetric about the line\nconnecting the star centers. This type of variation is difficult to understand in terms of spots\nin part because of the symmetry and in part because of the short timescales.\nThe distortions of the light curve made it difficult to derive a period, but the value given\nin Table 2 does a good job of align the eclipses in phase. While we attempted to correct\nthe system photometry to maximum light, we do not have light curve information during\nthe calibration observations, so that we are not full able to judge what kind of variations\nmight have been occuring. While the distortions of the light curve are interesting, because\nthe object does not appear to be a cluster member, we do not discuss it further here.\nV2389 Cyg: Although this system does not appear to be a cluster member, it does\nhave total eclipses, as noted by Street et al. (2002). We note additionally that we detected\na sudden change in the depth of one eclipse from one night to the next (see Fig. 8). On the\nnights of HJD 2454697 through 2454699, we observed both eclipses on individual nights, and\nwhile they were of equal depth on the first two nights, on the third night one of the eclipses\nhad increased in brightness by approximately 0.1 mag. We only observed two later eclipses\nin the same filter band, but both were at the brighter level.\nV2394 Cyg: According to the PLC analysis, this binary appears to be a cluster member. The system shows short timescale (\u223c 0.14 d) variations reminiscent of a contact binary,\nand long timescale variations in overall brightness level (see Fig. 9). Both types of varia3\n\nThis star is labeled as \"V2\" in the finder chart of Kaluzny & Shara (1988), but their tabulated photometry and the position of V2 in their CMD is not consistent with our photometry. We believe that \"V1\" in\ntheir table and CMD corresponds to this variable.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ntions make it difficult to derive an accurate period, but it is clear that it is close to that of\nStreet et al. (2002).\n\n3.3.\n\nDetached Eclipsing Binaries (DEBs)\n\nCluster members that are DEBs were one of the main goals of this study because of\ntheir ability to provide masses and radii. Of the newly detected DEBs, the most interesting\nare A494 (a possible blue straggler), A259, A536, and A665 (near the cluster turnoff), and\nID 1602 (faint main sequence). The stars below are ordered by brightness.\nA494 (WOCS 007006): Although this system was discovered to be variable by\nKaluzny & Shara (1988), they were unable to fully characterize the system due to their\nsmall number of observations. For the first time, we detect clear evidence of total eclipses in\nthis short period binary, with only a small amount of variation outside of eclipse (see Fig.\n10). There appears to be a small difference in eclipse depths with this period, although we\nsee some variation in depth that may be an indication of spot activity. (Note that A494 was\nclose to close to saturating pixels in the DAO images, so the variations there should not be\ntaken as necessarily representing the stellar variability.) As a result, there is some possibility\nthat the true period is twice what we quote in Table 2. The shallowness of the total eclipses\n(\u223c 0.14 mag) is a strong indication that there is a third star present that contributes most\nof the system's light. We have two spectra taken the HET (see Table 3) that only show one\nclearly detectable component.\nThe system has identification number 59 in the proper motion study of Sanders (1972),\nwho gave it a 57% probability of membership. The radial velocities of the brightest star at\nthe two epochs are significantly different from each other and one is significantly different\nfrom the cluster mean (2.34\u00b10.05 km s\u22121 with a dispersion \u03c3 = 1.02\u00b10.02 km s\u22121 ; Hole et al.\n2009), indicating that it may be showing a reflex motion in response to the gravity of the\neclipsing binary. We can estimate that the rotational velocity of the brightest star is 60 \u00b1 10\nkm s\u22121 . If it is a cluster member, it is likely that the third component is a blue straggler\nstar in its own right, and the close binary contains relatively low-mass main sequence stars.\nUsing the eclipse depths as guides, we find that we can reproduce the system photometry\nwith two cluster main sequence stars with 16.1 . V . 16.4, which would in turn result\nin a third star (V \u2248 14.4) falling near an extension of the cluster main sequence. That\nwould make A494 an example of a blue straggler system that must have formed from a\nbinary-binary star interaction. The straggler S1082 in the open cluster M67 presents a more\nextreme example in which 5 or more stars may have been involved in producing the three\nstars that are observed today (van den Berg et al. 2001; Sandquist et al. 2003). Another\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nexample is the star 7782 in the older cluster NGC 188, which appears to involve two blue\nstragglers in a binary system (Geller et al. 2009). If the radial velocities of the stars in the\neclipsing binary could be measured, it might be possible to determine the masses of all three\nstars.\nA259 (WOCS 040007): There was an eclipse during some of our calibration observations, although we had others on the same night that allowed us to calculate reliable system\nvalues. Spectra show two components (A. Geller & R. Mathieu, private communication).\nThe phased light curves are shown in Fig. 11. The observations in RK reveal that there is a\nshort period (about 45 min) of totality in both eclipses. Based on all of this information, this\nsystem is an excellent candidate for deriving mass and radius information for the component\nstars.\nA536 (WOCS 022003): The interval between two eclipses of different depth observed\nin 2001 was about 2.12 d. However, the remainder of our observations contain only partial\ncoverage of several eclipses and were separated by large time intervals. Radial velocity\ninformation (A. Geller & R. Mathieu, private communication) allowed us to identify a period\nof 4.30103 d, which in turn indicates that the eccentricity is near zero. (Phased light curves\nare shown in Fig. 12.) The radial velocities also indicate that the more massive star is\nfarther from us during the deeper eclipse in RC , as expected if both stars are on the main\nsequence.\nA536 shows three components in spectra (A. Geller & R. Mathieu, private communication; Table 3). Because the brighter stars are part of the eclipsing binary, it should be\npossible to derive mass and radius information for them. The third component may explain other peculiarities of the photometric observations - most notably that there are deep\neclipses observed in RK at the same phase when a clear secondary eclipse was observed in\nRC . We emphasize that radial velocities clearly rule out other possible periods. There is a\nstar about 1.\u2032\u2032 6 south of A536 that was not resolved in RC that is probably influencing the\nmeasured eclipse depths. This star appears to be WOCS 34003, which has V = 15.66 and\nB \u2212V = 0.62. Our images in RK have the best spatial resolution, which probably results in\nless dilution of the binary's light.\nThe nearby star is also a possible contaminant in the spectra used for radial velocities\nbecause in poor seeing conditions its light could enter the fiber optic cables used in the\nspectrograph. (The cables have sky widths of 2\u2032\u2032 for the HET spectra and 3\u2032\u2032 for the Geller\n& Mathieu spectra.) The third component in spectra appears near the cluster mean in\nagreement with this idea. If true, this system could still provide a good age constraint for\nthe cluster.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nThis object is an interesting test of how well image subtraction photometry can do in\nderiving precise light curves in a moderately crowded stellar environment. In a high-precision\nlight curve from the Kepler mission, these stars will undoubtedly be blended due to the nearly\n4\u2032\u2032 pixels. We are continuing work on this system with the aim of doing a full analysis of the\neclipsing binary. At worst it should be possible to treat the nearby star as a \"third light\"\ncontributor that dilutes the binary's light, but with higher resolution observations the true\neclipse depths should be measurable.\nA665 (WOCS 024009): We have not yet been able to identify a period for the system\ndue to a combination of partial coverage of eclipses and no indication yet that the eclipses\nhave different depths. Fig. 13 shows our detections of parts of eclipses. High-precision\nKepler light curves should be able to identify differences in eclipse depths and enable a\nperiod determination. In any case, this is likely to be the eclipsing binary with the longest\nperiod detected in this survey. Spectra indicate that the system has three components (A.\nGeller & R. Mathieu, private communication). There is no indication of a resolvable blended\nstar, so this system may be a triple. At least one of the brighter stars in the group is in the\neclipsing binary, so it should be possible to derive mass and radius information.\nA824 (WOCS 059010): This system shows eclipses of moderate (\u223c 0.15 mag) depth\n(see Fig. 14). Parts of eclipses were detected on 8 of the 10 nights of the DAO photometry\nobservations, implying a period of a day or less. The small size of the out-of-eclipse variation\n(as much as 0.02 mag) indicates that the correct period is probably the longest possible\nacceptable period. This led to the identified period of approximately 0.787 d. Because the\neclipses are of similar depth and because there are out-of-eclipse variations (probably due to\nmagnetic activity), it is hard to definitively identify a primary and secondary eclipse.\nIn our best seeing images, this star appears to be a marginally resolvable blend, with\na separation of about 1.\u2032\u2032 2 along an axis ESE to WNW. The blend probably affects the\ndepths of the eclipses in all filter bands, but especially in the lower-resolution RC from DAO.\nSpectra have only detected a cluster non-member with constant radial velocity (Hole et al.\n2009). The detected eclipsing binary has a very short period for a binary that shows little\nout-of-eclipse variation, and so this reinforces the idea that the eclipsing binary is composed\nof small faint main sequence stars. Because of the possibility the binary could be a cluster\nmember, we are studying this system further, although the much brighter nonmember star\nwill make spectroscopic analysis more difficult.\nV2381 Cyg: A primary eclipse occurred on the night of our calibration observations,\naffecting all of our measurements. We were able to correct the V measurements to out-ofeclipse values using the differential photometry, but this is not yet possible with the B and\nI measurements. The quoted B \u2212 V color in Table 2 comes from Street et al. (2002), and\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nputs the system well to the blue of the main sequence. CMDs using instrumental magnitudes\nfrom nights without eclipses confirm that the system is bluer than the cluster main sequence.\nThe implication is that the system is not a cluster member.\nID 1602 (2MASS 19410280+4007116): The photometry for this system places it\nbetween the single-star main sequence and the equal-mass binary sequence. We detected\nthree deep (\u223c 0.8 mag) partial eclipses in V , one shallower (\u223c 0.6 mag) eclipse in RK , and\npart of four eclipses in RC . Three eclipses observed in RC were each separated by a little\nover two days, and the middle one appears to be a shallower secondary eclipse. We believe\na period of 4.1108 d is most likely, and the data is phased to this period in Fig. 15.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nOne of the primary discoveries in this study was three variable blue stragglers which\neach present evidence of formation through binary-moderated dynamical interactions. These\nstars exist in NGC 6819 alongside four additional blue straggler systems that show velocity\nvariability (Hole et al. 2009) indicative of binarity, although the history of these systems\ncannot yet be reconstructed. These results emphasize how photometric and spectroscopic\nstudies of blue stragglers are complementary - photometric studies tend to be biased toward\nthe discovery of short-period binary systems, while spectroscopy is essentially the only way of\ndiscovering populations of long-period binaries (Geller et al. 2009, e.g.). However, together\nthe photometric and radial velocity variables only account for about 50% of the blue straggler\npopulation in this cluster. Spectroscopic abundance studies (Shetrone & Sandquist 2000;\nFerraro et al. 2006, e.g.) provide another avenue for delving into blue straggler formation\nhistories even for single stars.\nMore importantly though, we have uncovered four detached eclipsing binary systems\nnear the cluster turnoff of NGC 6819. Three of the systems are very likely to be cluster\nmembers, and the membership of the fourth is still to be determined. Because of the selection\nbias against photometrically detecting long period eclipsing binary systems, there is a fair\nchance that others are present (Rucinski et al. 1996, e.g.). The Kepler satellite provides an\nideal means of detecting additional systems in NGC 6819. If all of these systems are fully\nanalyzed to derive masses and radii for the eclipsing components, they will densely constrain\ntheoretical stellar models near the turnoff.\nWe thank A.
