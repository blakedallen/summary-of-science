There are secular\nchanges in 7 physical parameters, and we achieve for the first time, an absolute age\ncalibration. We find that the comet entered the inner solar system and began sublimating\nin 1645\u00b140 AD. i) It is concluded that the secular light curve can place constraints on the\npole orientation of the nucleus of some comets, and we measure the ecliptic longitude of\nthe south pole of 2P/Encke equal to 213.2\u00b14.5o, in excellent agreement with other\ndeterminations of this parameter, but with smaller error. j) Using the observed absolute\nmagnitude of 1858 and 2003 and a suitable theoretical model, the extinction date of the\ncomet is determined. We obtain ED = 2056\u00b13 AD, implying that the comet's lifetime is\n125\u00b112 revolutions about the sun after entering the inner solar system.\n\n\f4\n1. Introduction\nThere has been little research into the secular light curves (SLCs) of comets, in\nspite of the fact that they can provide a large amount of information. Besides, the SLCs\ncan be used to create a long term movie of the different apparitions thus compiling the\nphotometric history of the object. In this work we attempt to create two frames of that\nmovie for comet 2P/Encke. The amount of new information generated is very significant,\nmore than 20 new physical parameters.\nIn a series of papers (Ferr\u00edn 2005a, 2006, 2007, from now on Papers I, II, III), we\nhave presented the secular light curves (SLCs) of 9 comets. Recently we have completed\nwork on the \"Atlas of Secular Light Curves of Comets\" (Ferr\u00edn, 2008) were 27 cometary\nSLCs are presented. This work should be consulted to place into perspective the present\ninvestigation, and it may be downloaded from the web site cited at the end of this paper.\nHere we are going to study the SLC of 2P/Encke in detail. This is the comet with the\nlargest number of recorded apparitions, due to its short orbital period of 3.3 years. We\nalso present our own observation of this object in Figure 1.\nIn Paper I we introduced two views of the SLC, the time plot and the reflected\ndouble log plot. Over 18 physical parameters derived from the SLCs are listed in the\nplots (Figures 2 to 5), many of them new, and provide a wealth of new photometric\ninformation on this object that serves to complement other studies.\nA key to the SLC\nparameters can be found in Paper I, and an updated key is kept at the web site cited at\nthe end of this paper. The magnitude at \u2206, R, \u03b1, is denoted by V(\u2206, R, \u03b1), where \u2206 is the\ncomet-Earth distance, R is the Sun-comet distance, and \u03b1 is the phase angle. Briefly the\nmeasured parameters listed in the log plot are: the turn on point RON, the turn off point\nROFF, the asymmetry parameter ROFF/RON, the magnitude at turn on VON(1,R,0), the\nmagnitude at turn off VOFF(1,R,0), the absolute magnitude before perihelion m1B(1,1), the\nabsolute magnitude after perihelion m1A(1,1), the mean value of both <m1(1,1)>, the slope\nof the SLC just before perihelion nqB, the slope just after perihelion nqA, the absolute\nnuclear magnitude VN(1,1,0), the phase coefficient \u03b2, the amplitude of the secular light\ncurve ASEC(1,1)= VN(1,1,0) - m1(1,1), the effective diameter DEFFE, the photometric age PAGE in comet years (cy). Additionally from the literature the following parameters have\nbeen listed in the plot, the perihelion distance q, the aphelion distance Q, the geometric\nalbedo pV, the mean color index <V-R>. In the top line of the plot, right side, JF86 means\nthat this is a Jupiter family comet of 86 comet years of age. V.08 is the version of the plot\n(year), and Epoch 2003 indicates the epoch of the observations that better define the\nenvelope.\nThe time plot contains a listing of the perihelia plotted, the orbital period of the\ncomet PORB, the next perihelion in format YYYYMMDD, the number of observations used\nin the plot, the time lag at perihelion, LAG, the turn on time, TON, the turn off time, TOFF, the\nasymmetry parameter, TOFF/TON, the active time, TACTIVE, the slope at turn on, SON, the\nslope at turn off, SOFF, and the time-age, T-AGE, in comet years (cy).\nThe importance of these secular light curves is that they show not only what we\nknow, but also what we do not know, thus pointing the way to meaningful observations.\nThe SLCs are very useful for planning observations. For example from the time plot we\n\n\f5\ncan deduce that the bare nucleus of 2P/Encke can be seen only at times with respect to\nperihelion, -228 < \u2206t < -92 d, +94 < \u2206t < +161 d, and +393 < \u2206t < 413 d (confirmation\nFigure 4 and 5). Beyond these intervals the nucleus is coma contaminated.\nPaper I justifies the procedures adopted in this paper, and reading it would help to\nget acquainted with the plots, procedures and parameters measured from them. It also\nhelps to place into perspective the results found in the present work.\nThe photometric system used in this work is described in Paper I but a short\ndescription follows. No corrections were applied to the observations. The methodology\noutlined in that paper makes no corrections and lets the brightest observations define the\nenvelope. It was found and justified there, that the envelope of the observations is the\nbest representation of the SLC of comets. The justification is that all visual observations\nof comets are affected by several effects, all of which decrease the perceived brightness\nof the object by washing out the outer coma: moonlight, twilight, haze, cirrus clouds, dirty\noptics, excess magnification, large aperture, etc. There are no corresponding physical\neffects that could increase the perceived brightness of a comet. Thus the envelope is the\ncorrect interpretation of the SLC and it does not require corrections of any kind. This rule\nis confirmed observationally. The top observations in Figure 2 and 3 show a sharp edge,\nwhile the bottom observations have no edge and are distributed in a diffuse area.\nAfter presenting the evidence, we will conclude that 2P/Encke is an old comet\nentering the methuselah stage (100 cy < P-AGE), active at perihelion (Source 1) and with\nremarkable activity centered at aphelion (Source 2). In the context of this investigation \"a\nsource\" may include several active regions lumped together rather than a surface\nsublimating on every square inch.\nSince aphelion takes place at Q= 4.09 AU the\nquestion is what drives the sublimation. We will conclude that H2O may be the source of\nthis activity due to a circumstantial situation: a pole of the comet points to the Sun at\nperihelion and aphelion. Additionally it has been possible to achieve an absolute age\ncalibration and to determine the extinction date.\n2. Observations\nOur observational program of faint comets was established in the 90s, and comet\n2P/Encke was imaged on November 18th, 1993, using the 1 m f/3 Schmidt telescope of\nthe National Observatory of Venezuela. The exposure time was 420s and the night was\nphotometric. The image is shown in Figure 1 and the field size is 5'x6.7'. The telescope\nwas coupled with a Thompson 7883 CCD, of 576x384 pixels. Since this detector had a\nfairly low quantum efficiency, the observations were filterless in order to maximize the S/N\nratio. The maximum response curve between 6500 and 7500 A, is approximated fairly\nwell by a broad band R filter. The CCD is quite blind at 4500 A. Processing was done\nusing standard reduction procedures. Calibration of the magnitudes was done using the R\nmagnitudes of the USNO A2.0 catalog.\nTo avoid errors from poor magnitude stars, a\nleast squares calibration of the field was done with no less than 15 stars. Stars deviating\nfrom the linear fit by more than 3\u03c3 were dropped.\nThis calibration method is good to\n~\u00b10.1 magnitudes. The comet was then at an Earth's distance \u2206= 0.94 AU, sun distance\nR= 1.60 AU, and phase angle, \u03b1 = 35.6o, \u2206 t = -83 d.\n\n\f6\nWe found the following results, R(\u2206,R,\u03b1)= 17.0\u00b10.15, R(1,1,\u03b1)= 16.11\u00b10.15,\nV(1,R,0)= 15.08\u00b10.15. In Paper II we have compiled all the nuclear color observations of\nthis comet, and we find a mean color index < V - R > = 0.44\u00b10.04, where <x> denotes the\nmean value.\nWe can then calculate that V(\u2206,R,\u03b1)= 17.44\u00b10.15. These values are\nplotted in the SLC (Figures 2 and 3) and by good luck lie in the region were the comet is\nturning on, thus helping to define the extent of activity of 2P. In fact the observation was\nmade only +4 days after turn on of activity.\n3. 2P/Encke\nLamy et al. (2005) have a very useful compilation on physical properties of comets,\nand it is recommended reading on other physical parameters of this comet.\nData Sets\nWe were able to extract 768 observations of this comet from the literature.\nThe literature is very extensive because of its short orbital period of 3.3 years and\nbecause of its favorable observing conditions. We will restrict ourselves to those works\ndealing with photometry and related matters (pole orientation). Up to now all the\nphotometric observations available had not been placed into one single plot.\nObservations by the following authors were used: Ney (1974), Jewitt and Meech (1987),\nLuu and Jewitt (1990), Fernandez et al. (2000), Meech et al. (2001) (published in Belton et\nal. (2005)), Lowry et al. (2003), Belton et al. (2005), Fernandez et al. (2005), Hergenrother\net al. (2006), Lowry and Weissman (2007). For visual observations we used the dataset\ncompiled in the International Comet Quarterly (Green, 2006). Also, there are many visual\nand CCD observations available in the web. One remarkable data set is that of Biesecker\n(2000) comprising total magnitudes derived from SOHO spacecraft images taken at\nperihelion.\nThe dataset of Fernandez et al. (2005) is remarkable in its extent and precision. It\ncontains the data presented separately by Lowry et al. (2003) and Hergenrother et al\n(2006). Because it has been taken when the comet was at aphelion, and because the\nspacing between sets is as small as a day, this data set deserves additional analyzing to\ndetermine the day to day variability, and this is done in a dedicated section below.\nSecular Light Curves Using the reducing procedure described in paper I, the SLCs were\nplotted in Figures 2 to 5. As explained in the introduction the SLCs are presented in two\nviews, the Log plot, and the time plot. The importance of the log plot is that power laws\non R (Rn), plot as straight lines. The log plot is a double logarithmic plot reflected at R=1\nAU to allow the determination of the absolute magnitude by extrapolation to Log R= 0.\nTime runs on the horizontal axis toward the right, although non-linearly. On the other\nhand, the importance of the time plot is that time runs linearly in the horizontal axis,\nshowing the brightness history of the object. The two plots complement each other, and\nboth are needed because they provide two independent views of the same phenomena on\ndifferent phase spaces and give different physical parameters. Comet 2P/Encke requires\nan additional plot to show the activity at aphelion (Figure 4).\nThe top observations in Figures 2 and 3 are mostly visual measurements by\namateurs, denoted by m1, while faint observations are nowadays CCD measurements by\namateurs and professionals, denoted by V.\nFerr\u00edn (2005b) has found a negligible\ncorrection from one system to the other, V - m1 = -0.026\u00b10.007 magnitudes. This result\n\n\f7\ncan be checked. For stars Zissell (2003) finds V = m1 - 0.182 * (B - V ) + 0.07. Since\ncomets have a mean V - B = 0.5, then V = m1 - 0.02, in perfect agreement with our result.\nThe log plot (Figure 2) represents a normal SLC, with a well defined turn on and\nturn off points, and a slight time lag at perihelion. The time plot (Figure 3) also shows\nnormal activity near perihelion (Source 1). Both plots allow the determination of over 18\nphysical parameters, many of them new, and they are listed in the plots.\nFrom Figure 2, the log plot, we can determine that the comet turns on at RON (S1)=\n-1.63\u00b10.03 AU and turns off at ROFF (S1) = +1.49\u00b10.2 AU (the minus sign indicates\nobservations prior to perihelion). We also measure the amplitude of the secular light\ncurve, ASEC(1,1)= 4.8\u00b10.1, and the mean absolute magnitude of the comet <m1(1,1)> =\n10.7\u00b10.2. However it must be pointed out that the SLC is asymmetric and thus the\nabsolute magnitude before perihelion (m1B(1,1)= 9.8\u00b10.1) is quite different from the\nabsolute magnitude after perihelion (m1A(1,1)= 11.5\u00b10.1), presenting a decay of 1.7\u00b10.15\nmagnitudes at R= 1 AU from the Sun post perihelion.\nThe time plot, Figure 3, also gives some interesting information. We find that the\ncomet turns on at TON= -87\u00b15 d, and turns off at TOFF= +94\u00b115 d, while the time lag at\nperihelion is LAG(q)= 6\u00b11 d. We have not attempted to reconcile the values derived from\nthe two plots, to give some idea of the errors involved and to provide two independent\ndeterminations of the onset and offset of activity. Another parameter is the total active\ntime of the comet TACTIVITY = 181\u00b115 d or ~6 months. Additional parameters are listed in\nthe plots.\nOne remarkable characteristic of this comet, it that it exhibits activity at aphelion\nwithout a detectable coma (confirmation Figures 2, 4 and 5). The aphelion activity was\nrecognized by a number of researchers, Sekanina (1976), Barker et al. (1981), Meech et\nal. (2001), Meech et al. (2004), Belton (2005). The SLC shows that the observations are\ntoo bright above the nuclear line (R+2). In order to visualize the activity more clearly, we\nhave compiled and plotted all observations near aphelion, and they are shown in Figure 4.\nIt is remarkable that the activity is quite significant in time interval (TACTIVITY = 815\u00b130 d)\nand in intensity (ASEC (1,Q) = 3.0\u00b10.2 mag). For comparison, the total orbital time of the\ncomet in 2003 was only 1206 days. Below we will suggest an origin for the activity for\nSource 2.\nAdditional interesting parameters deduced from Figure 4 are the turn on and turn\noff distances of Source 2. We find TON(S2)= +160\u00b125 d, which corresponds to a solar\ndistance RON(S2)= +2.41 AU, and TOFF(S2)= +975\u00b115 d, which corresponds to ROFF(S2)=\n-2.94 AU.\nAdditional parameters of S2 are the time lags measured from perihelion\nLAG(q) = +718\u00b130 d and from aphelion LAG(Q) = +120\u00b130 d.\nPhotometric anomaly Figure 4 shows a minimum brightness at ~+400 d. In Figure 5 the\nminimum of activity at aphelion is enlarged. We see a linear decay in brightness between\n+312 and +393 d after perihelion, and a minimum between +393 and +413 d. In future\napparitions it would be interesting to verify if the minimum repeats in the same place. This\nmight be an indication of topography or the turn off of and active region. To be able to\nfollow a specific point on the surface of a comet is of great interest, because it may allow a\nmore precise determination of rotational evolution and of excited rotational periods.\n\n\f8\nPhotometric age P-AGE and time-age T-AGE In papers I and II the following age-related\nparameters were defined: the photometric age and the time-age,\nP-AGE = 1440 / (RON + ROFF ) * ASEC\nT-AGE = 90240 / (TON + TOFF ) * ASEC\nand we have concluded that they are very robust definitions. Comet ages have been\nscaled to human ages. Using the information derived above, we find P-AGE = 97\u00b18 cy\n(comet years) and T-AGE= 103\u00b19 cy. If we define 75 cy < old < 100 cy, and 100 cy <\nmethuselah, then this comet is going from old to methuselah. It must be emphasized that\nwhat P-AGE and T-AGE really measure is activity as a proxy for age and that is the\nreason they are measured in comet years.\nGeometric albedo An important physical parameter needed to derive the dimension of the\nnucleus is the geometric albedo in the R-band, pR.\nThe only determination of this\nparameter is by Fernandez et al. (2000) who find pR = 0.047\u00b10.023. No doubt this is a\ndifficult measurement, so the error is not surprising. Thus we would benefit from a remeasurement, and this is best done when the bare nucleus is visible ( -228 d < \u2206t < -92 d,\n+94 d < \u2206t < 161 d, and +393 d < \u2206t < 413 d , confirmation Figure 4).\nPhase curve, phase coefficient, and absolute nucleus dimensions The best way to derive\nthe absolute nuclear magnitude of a comet is by plotting the phase diagram, V(1,1,\u03b1 ) vs\n\u03b1. The slope of this curve gives the phase coefficient, \u03b2, which is needed to reduce\nnuclear observations to a common phase angle of 0o.\nFernandez et al. (2000) have\ndone this type of plot. However these authors included photographic observations, and\ncoma contaminated values are clearly seen in their phase curve. The CN line at 3883 A is\nthe most intense of the whole cometary spectrum, thus many of those measurements are\ncontaminated by the intense CN blue coma. From the plot they find RN(1,1,0)= 15.2\u00b10.5\nand \u03b2= 0.061 mag/o (no error quoted). So it is of scientific interest to use only modern\nCCD observations (sensitive to the red part of the spectrum) to repeat the phase plot and\nfind if there is any difference.\nThe new plot shown in Figure 6 contains only observations carried out with CCDs,\nIDS (image dissector scanner) and HST (Hubble Space Telescope) that have already\nbeen calibrated and instrument corrected (Fernandez et al., 2000). We find the following\nresults: a) The absolute nuclear magnitude is RN(1,1,0)= 15.05\u00b10.14 and \u03b2= 0.066\u00b10.003\nmag/o. The new absolute magnitude is in close agreement with the one derived by\nFernandez et al. (2000), but the errors have been reduced significantly.\nWhy should these values be better than previous determinations? Because we\nhave imposed to the phase plot three additional constraints: 1) That the observations be\ndevoid of coma (this means to drop photographic observations). 2) That the observations\nlie inside the rotational amplitude of the nucleus. And 3) that the absolute magnitude\nVN(1,1,0) be in agreement with the faintest nuclear observations at aphelion (confirmation\nFigure 5). As a result, the errors are smaller.\n\n\f9\nIn Paper II we found a mean color index < V - R > = 0.44\u00b10.04, and with this\ninformation the absolute magnitude in the visual is VN(1,1,0)= 15.49\u00b10.15.\nWhen this\nvalue is plotted in Figures 4 and 5, the nuclear line is in accord with the lowest\nobservations made by Fernandez et al. (2005) and Meech et al. (2001) at aphelion thus\nsatisfying constraint 3) listed above. As a byproduct we find the peak-to-valley amplitude\nof the rotational light curve at aphelion, APTV = 0.62\u00b10.08 magnitudes.\nIn Figure 6 we have also plotted our observation of 2P/Encke. In spite of having\nbeen taken only +4 days after turn on, it is already coma contaminated.\nThis result\nshows that the phase diagram is a very sensitive way to detect coma activity and justifies\nthe adoption of constraint 1) cited above. Constraint 2) justifies itself.\nA compilation of phase coefficients, \u03b2, has been presented in Paper I, and it can be\nseen that this value for 2P/Encke is one of the largest, implying an extreme surface\ntexture (a conclusion previously reached by Fernandez et al. (2000) and Lamy et al.,\n(2005)).\nNucleus dimensions\nThis comet has been observed by radar (Kamoun et al., 1981),\nand these researchers have obtained a nucleus diameter of D= 3.0 (+4.6, -2.0) km.\nFernandez et al. (2000) obtain D= 4.8\u00b10.6 km. Reach et al. (2000) find D= 4\u00b12 km.\nLowry et al. (2003) find D= 8.1\u00b10.12 km. Kelley et al. (2006) find two values, D=\n4.68\u00b10.28 km, and D= 3.44\u00b10.20 km, but consider the possibility that the second one may\nbe evidence of a non-spherical nucleus, and deduce a ratio of axis a/c > 1.4 . Harmon\nand Nolan (2005) had a second chance to see the comet by radar during the close\napproach of 2003, and they find 4.84 km < D < 7.44 km.\nWe can determine the effective diameter DEFFE, using the absolute nuclear\nmagnitude RN(1,1,0) from the phase plot (Figure 4), the geometric albedo in the red\ndetermined by Fernandez et al. (2000), pR, and the amicable formula deduced in Paper III:\nLog [ pR D2EFFE / 4 ] = 5.510 - 0.4 RN(1,1,0)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RN(1,1,0) is the absolute nuclear magnitude in the R band. We find DEFFE =\n5.12(+2.5;-1.7) km. The error is mostly due to the error in the geometric albedo which is\nrather large. This value is consistent with previous determinations but should be nearer to\nthe truth because of the imposed constraints 1) to 3).\nAs an example of why the determination of the nuclear size benefits from the\ninformation given by the SLCs, let us consider the recently derived size by Lowry and\nWeissman (2007) who find a mean effective diameter = 7.90\u00b10.12 km which is surprisingly\nlarge and accurate. This result contains three inaccuracies. The first one arises because\nthese authors use the geometric albedo derived by Fernandez et al. (2000), pR = 0.047\nforgetting to include the associated error of \u00b10.023 discussed above in the geometric\nalbedo section. Thus their propagation or errors is incorrect resulting in an unrealistically\nsmall error of \u00b10.12 km. The second inaccuracy arises because they use a phase\ncoefficient of \u03b2 = 0.06 mag/o. However this value cited from Fernandez et al. (2000),\ncontained photographic magnitudes as well as total magnitudes above the rotational\namplitude. Our result presented above in the phase plot section, shows that the correct\n\n\f10\nphase coefficient is \u03b2 = 0.066 \u00b1 0.003 mag/o (confirmation our Figure 6). The third\ninaccuracy appears because they assume that the nucleus is devoid of an unresolved\ncoma. To verify this let us take the photometry of the first night, October 3rd, 2002. They\nfind the mean night value for the photometry < R(\u2206, R, \u03b1) > = 19.78\u00b10.03. Since this\nobservation was made +754 days after perihelion at a phase angle of 7.12o, and using a\ncolor coefficient from these authors of < V - R > = 0.39 \u00b1 0.06, we find a reduced\nmagnitude V(1,1,0) = 14. 34 \u00b1 0.08. Plotting this value in Figure 4 that shows the\naphelion activity of comet 2P/Encke, we find that the observation was actually 1.15 mag\nabove the nucleus due to an unresolved coma. No wonder then that the radius they\nfound was so large.\nAlternatively the unresolved coma could have been detected from the phase plot,\nand this is confirmed in Figure 6 were we see that it lies well above the rotational\namplitude.\nThe moral of this tale is clear. Erroneous values can be derived by ignoring the\ninformation given by the secular light curve. This is further proof of the importance and\nsignificance of the concept of the SLCs derived in these series of works.\nRotational period Another surprising result obtained by these authors is that their\npreferred rotational period is 11.083\u00b10.003 h. However the associated rotational light\ncurve exhibits only one maximum and one minima, something impossible for a rotating\nellipsoid. In fact their alternative period 22.2190 h exhibits two maxima and two minima\nseparated by 180o, which is what is expected of a rotating ellipsoid. Since this analysis\ncontains the lengthy photometry by Fernandez et al. (2005) it is tempting to conclude that\nthis is the real rotational period of the comet. And this is confirmed by the fact that their\nOctober 3 and 4 photometry fits perfectly with the rotational light curve if it is displaced\nupward by only 0.25 magnitudes.\nAphelion activity without coma\n2P/Encke presents double activity, at perihelion and\naphelion (Figures 4 and 5). The list of authors that have contributed to this knowledge has\nbeen given above.\nThe activity at aphelion extends for 815\u00b130 days, while that at\nperihelion lasts for only 202\u00b115 days. This is a most unusual behavior not shown by any\nother comet up to now, and suggests that two sources are active. Since activity at\naphelion takes place at 4.09 AU from the sun, the question arises of what substance is\ncontrolling sublimation. According to a calculation by Delsemme (1982) it was previously\nbelieved that water ice sublimation could not be sustained beyond 3 AU. However recent\ncalculations by Meech and Svoren (2005) show that water ice sublimation can be\nsustained up to 4-6 AU.\nSekanina (1988a) and Festou and Barale (2000) find that one pole of the comet\npoints to the sun at perihelion. This opens the possibility that the activity at aphelion is\nproduced at the other pole, in which case 2P/Encke shows activity at the two poles, a\nmost peculiar situation.\n4. Dataset of Fernandez et al. (2005)\n\n\f11\nIt is not clear if the activity at aphelion is sustained (continuous) or impulsive\n(superposition of discrete outbursts). The data set of Fernandez et al. (2005) of rotational\nmeasurements (Table 1), is remarkable for its extent and precision, and because they\nwere carried out at aphelion, they can be used to say something about the type of activity\nexhibited at those distances.\nMeans and ranges have been calculated for every night, and plotted as a function\nof time in Figure 7. There are four observing intervals. In the first, third and fourth\nintervals the comet remains practically constant. The second interval in the middle lasting\n15 d is much fainter than the other three and exhibits a drop of 1.1 magnitudes in 13 days.\nThe lowest night is 1.5 magnitudes below the steady state nights. Notice also that the\namplitude of the rotational light curve is larger for the fainter magnitudes, implying that\nbrighter magnitudes are coma contaminated. This is the justification for imposing\nconstraint 1) in the phase plot.\nThe following is evidence of sustained activity (Figure 7): a) From July 19th to\nAugust 13th, an interval of 25 days, the comet maintained its mean brightness within \u00b10.1\nmagnitudes. b) During September 12th, 2002, and September 16th, an interval of 6 days,\nthe comet maintained its mean brightness within \u00b10.03 magnitudes.\nThe following is evidence of impulsive activity: a) A decrease of 1.1 magnitudes in\nan interval of 13 days, from September 23r to October 6th, 2001. b) What looks like a\nlinear decrease of 1.3 magnitudes in an interval of 82 days, seen in Figure 5 from \u2206t =\n+310 to +392 d after perihelion, producing a sharp minimum shown expanded in Figure 5.\nFrom Figures 4 and 5 we conclude that the comet exhibits both types of behavior.\nThe impulsive activity is reminiscent of the one exhibited by comets 29P/SchwassmannWhachmann 1 and 95P/Chiron.\n5. Pole Orientation and the SLC\nThe shape of the SLC is determined by several physical parameters that are\nentangled: the pole orientation (I, \u03a6), the composition, and the thermal conductivity.\nThese are the first order parameters. There may be second order parameters (like\ntopography and shape of the nucleus) that affect the SLC, but they will not be considered\nbecause they produce a much smaller influence. The question is how to disentangle\nthem. There are two cases in which it may be relatively simple: pole perpendicular to the\norbit, and pole parallel to the orbit.\nConsider the case where the pole is perpendicular to the orbit. The Sun shines all\nthe time on the equator of the comet. Thus the parameter LAG (measured at the\nmaximum brightness of the SLC) must be entirely due to the thermal lag. However Lamy\net al. (2003) have made a first order calculation assuming a thermal inertia of 10\nJ/K/m2/s1/2, and found that the heat wave penetrates rather slowly, approximately 1\ncm/day.\nThis value is very small, and it implies that the observed LAG time in the SLC\ncould not be due to a thermal lag.\nConsider now the case where the pole is parallel to the orbit. Then the parameter\nLAG must take place when the pole is pointing to the Sun, and minimum light may take\n\n\f12\nplace when it is shining on the equator. This may be the case of 2P/Encke, with the\npeculiarity that one pole points nearly to the sun at perihelion.\nThe situation for 2P/Encke is shown in Figure 8, where the points of turn on and\nturn off of the two active sources (S1 and S2) have been indicated and are taken from\nFigures 2, 3 and 4. This Figure is actually saying something about the distribution of\nvolatiles on the surface of 2P/Encke, and this distribution is shown in Figure 12.\nPole orientation\nSekanina (1988b) and Festou and Barale (2000) have obtained a\nsolution for the spin axis that is practically the same (see also Samarasinha, 1997). The\npole points to the Sun 4 days after perihelion according to the Sekanina's solution, and 6\ndays for the Festou and Barale's solution. These values are in excellent agreement with\nthe LAG time deduced from the SLC, 6\u00b11 days (confirmation Figure 2) because maximum\nbrightness corresponds to maximum temperature.\nIt is thus possible to derive the pole orientation solely from the SLC. If we assume\nthat the maximum brightness of the SLC corresponds to the moment in which the comet\npoints one pole to the sun, then a LAG= +6\u00b11 d can be translated into an angle \u03bd =\n26.7\u00b14.5o for the true anomaly. The SLC can constraint the ecliptic longitude of the pole.\nSekanina (1988b) concludes that comet 2P/Encke has a pole pointing to ecliptic\nlongitude 200o, ecliptic latitude +18o. From Figure 8 and from the fact that the longitude\nof perihelion of this comet is \u03c0 = 186.5o , we find that the pole of this comet points toward\necliptic longitude 213.2\u00b14.5o. Thus our observational value is in close agreement with\nSekanina and the errors superimpose. The result is also in agreement with Festou and\nBarale (2000).\nThe SLCs can also derive a value for the ecliptic latitude through\nmodeling of the light curve, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThis implies that the SLCs derived in Papers I to III can be used to place limits on\nthe pole orientation of those comets. For example, the extreme LAG= +155\u00b110 d derived\nfor comet 133P/Elst-Pizarro (Paper II) may indicate that the pole of this comet points to\nthe sun at that time.\nThe south pole of 2P/Encke almost points to the Sun at perihelion. It is interesting\nto notice that this result supports the conclusion reached by Samarasinha (1997) who\nfound that pole orientations tend to migrate spiraling until one pole points to the Sun at\nperihelion. In the case of 2P/Encke, it is the south pole.\n6. Secular evolution, 1858 vs 2003.\nKamel (1991) has determined the secular light curve of 2P/Encke in 1832-1871\n(effective epoch 1858).\nAlthough he concludes that there is no significant secular\nchange, his plots and our plots say otherwise (confirmation Figure 9). We re-reduced his\ndata (Kamel, 1992) and the new log plot for 1858 appears in Figure 9 and the time plot in\nFigure 10. Using our interpretation of the envelope as the correct description of the SLC\n(paper I), we find that there are at least 7 physical parameters that have shown temporal\nevolution, LAG, m1B(1,1), m1A(1,1), RON, ROFF, P-AGE and T-AGE:\n\n\f13\na) There is a shift in LAG. The maximum brightness in 1858 took place with LAG= -14\u00b12\nd (before perihelion), and LAG= +6\u00b11 d in 2003, an interval of 145 years. So peak\nbrightness shifted by +0.14 d/y or 0.46 d/apparition in this interval.\nb) Change in absolute magnitude m(1,1). In 1858 R= 1 AU takes place at -43.3 d. Using\nKamel's Figures 9 and 10, we find the comet had an absolute magnitude before perihelion\nm1B(1,1)= 7.5\u00b10.2 in 1858, while in 2003 we find m1B(1,1)= 10.0\u00b10.2. After perihelion we\nfind in 1858 m1A(1,1)= 10.7\u00b10.2, and in 2003 m1A(1,1)= 11.5\u00b10.2. The comet is getting\nfainter in absolute magnitude.\nThe asymmetry at R= 1 AU was also larger, 3.2\nmagnitudes in 1858 vs 1.5 mag in 2003, half the value. The decaying rate of m1B(1,1)\nhas been 0.045 mag/apparition, while that of m1A(1,1) is 0.018 mag/apparition. A decay\nin absolute magnitude with time is also exhibited by the SLCs previously published.\nc) The maximum peak brightness has changed from mMAX(1,LAG)= 5.8\u00b10.2 in 1858 to\nmMAX(1,LAG)= 6.2\u00b10.2 in 2003, a statistically significant change.\nd) In 1858 the turn on point was RON(1858)= -2.18\u00b10.10 AU, while in 2003 we find\nRON(2003)= -1.63\u00b10.03. There is a significant decrease in turn on distance in the interval\nof 145 years, at the rate of -0.0127 AU/apparition.\ne) In 1858 the turn off distance was ROFF(1858)= +1.73\u00b10.10 AU, while in 2003 we find\nROFF(2003)= +1.49\u00b10.2 AU, implying a decrease of -0.0057 AU/apparition. Thus the SLC\nhas been narrowing with time, a behavior also shown by the comets presented in papers I\nto III.\nf) However the most interesting change is in P-AGE and T-AGE. We find P-AGE(1858)=\n58\u00b13 cy and T-AGE(1858)= 61\u00b14 cy. These values correspond to a middle age comet.\nSince we also know these ages in 2003, it is possible to calibrate P-AGE [cy] and T-AGE\n[cy] in absolute Earth years [y] to obtain the current date. This calibration is shown in\nFigure 11.\nCD = 1642 + 3.72 * P-AGE\nCD = 1647 + 3.45 * T-AGE\nwhere 1642 AD and 1647 AD are not the birth year of the comet but the year in which the\ncomet began sublimating. Thus we deduce a zero age date ZAD = 1645 \u00b1 40 AD (Figure\n11). However since sublimation is related to solar distance, this must also be the year in\nwhich the comet entered the inner solar system. The conversion factors 3.72 and 3.45\ncome in units of y/cy and give the change of scale from comet time to earth time.\nLifetime. We are interested in knowing the total lifetime of the comet in number of\nrevolutions around the sun. Several estimates have previously been made. If we scale\nWeissman (1980) results to Encke's values, we find a timescale of the order of a few\nhundreds orbits. Rickman et al. (1991) find that small nuclei can be consumed on a short\ntimescale (<100 revolutions). Cowan and A'Hearn (1979) published a sublimation model\nand calculated the lifetime in number of orbits for 2P/Encke. For a Bond albedo of 0.4,\nthey find a timescale of ~250 orbits. However their albedo is previous to the comet Halley\n\n\f14\nencounter, and now much smaller values are favored. So the new estimate is of the order\nof ~150 orbits.\nTo make our own estimate of the lifetime, we will make use of the secular absolute\nmagnitudes reported by Ferr\u00edn and Gil (1988). These authors have reduced historical\nabsolute magnitudes using visual observations and observations made with small\ninstruments. However their dataset shown in Figure 13 has to be moved by -0.6\nmagnitudes to take into account that they took the mean value of the observations, while\nwe now know that the correct interpretation is the envelope. Additionally we will adopt the\ntheoretical model there developed for a comet that looses a constant layer of water ice per\napparition.\nData and three models are compared in Figure 13. We see that the sublimating\nmodel fits the observations rather well. A model based on extinction due to suffocation\nwould decrease the absolute magnitude asymptotically and thus would not have a sharp\nend. This alternative model can not be ruled out, but the sublimating model is useful\nbecause it predicts an accelerated decay, and this may be evident in just a few decades,\nsince the predicted extinction date is just ED= 2056\u00b13 AD. This implies a total number of\nrevolutions of 125\u00b112 in agreement with previous estimates.\nFor other comets the timescale may be much larger, but for 2P/Encke the\nobservational value may be correct because of three reasons: a) The perihelion distance\nof this comet is very small, q= 0.33 AU, and compared with a comet at q=1 AU, 2P\nreceives 9 times more solar energy and thus ages 9 times faster. b) The pole points to\nthe sun at perihelion and aphelion. Thus at perihelion the comet is in daylight all the time.\nThe surface temperature is much higher than for a rotating comet with a pole\nperpendicular to the orbit, in which case the solar energy is spread out over the whole\nequatorial region.\nThus sublimation is optimized. Finally, c) the comet is active at\naphelion where other comets are inactive. a) to c) conspire to produce aging at a larger\nrate than for other Jupiter family comets and thus produce a shorter lifetime.\nOrbit and origin The orbit of this comet is very odd, being completely decoupled from\nJupiter. Levison et al. (2006) have tried to explain this condition by integrating a large\nnumber of test particles in similar orbits. They found that it takes roughly 200 times longer\nto evolve onto an orbit like this than the typical cometary physical lifetime. To reconcile\nthis result, they propose that: (a) 2P/Encke became dormant soon after it was kicked\ninwardly by Jupiter; (b) it spent a significant amount of time inactive while rattling around\nthe inner solar system; or (c) it only became active again as the \u03bd6 secular resonance\ndrove down its perihelion distance.\nWe will define a normal comet as one that exhibits sustained activity quasisymmetric with respect to perihelion, with a well defined turn on point before perihelion,\nand a well defined turn off point after perihelion (confirmation paper I). After comparing\nwith the other comets presented in papers I to III, it can be concluded that this comet is\nentirely normal, not showing any characteristic that could suggest a period of inactivity.\nOn the contrary, it shows activity at aphelion at 4.09 AU from the Sun. Thus we have not\nbeen able to find any evidence whatsoever in the SLCs, to support conclusions (a) to (c)\nabove. In fact, from what we have been able to learn from papers I-III, those conclusion\nare untenable because there is physically no way that a comet may rattle around the inner\n\n\f15\nsolar system without exhibiting a strong cometary activity. That situation has never been\nobserved for any comet. The \u03bd6 resonance is placed at ~2.05 AU from the Sun (Scholl\nand Froeschle, 1991) and thus is located well inside the region of activity shown by the\nSLC in 1858 AD, and could not be a hiding place for activity. Our secular light curve\nconstraints the residence orbit to beyond ~5-6 AU where it would show no activity and\nthus where it could remain for a considerable time without aging.\nAnother dynamic calculation has been carried out by Pittich et al. (2004). They get\na much smaller timescale including in the calculation non-gravitational forces. However,\naccording to Levison et al. (2006) (who did not include non-gravitational forces in their\ncalculation), the non-gravitational forces used in their model are unrealistically large and\nwere held constant. Since the SLCs show evidence of a short lifetime the question of the\norigin of the orbit of comet 2P/Encke remains without satisfactory solution and is still a\nmatter of debate.\nWe are fully aware that currently the zero age date, ZAD = 1645640 AD, can not\nbe explained dynamically. But neither can the current orbit. Additionally the age of the\nmeteor stream associated with this comet is ~4700 y or ~1400 orbits about the sun. Thus\none is tempted to conclude that the comet was inactive for a long time. But this situation\ncan not be explained either. Thus the mystery deepens. Such is the substance of\nscience.\nTo conclude this issue, we must mention that Whipple and Hamid (1972) carried\nout an intensive search for Encke's comet among nearly 600 transient objects in Ho's\n(1962) catalog, which covers observations until the period AD 1600. They turned up a\nhandful of suspects but no definitive candidate. This result is in perfect agreement with\nour determination, specially if we take into consideration that before 1600 AD, the\nabsolute magnitude of the comet should have been brighter than 5.5 (confirmation Figure\n13), and thus it is inconceivable that it should have escaped detection at times passing\nnear the Earth.\n7. Conclusions\nThe main conclusions of this work are:\n1) We define a normal comet as one that exhibits sustained activity quasi-symmetric with\nrespect to perihelion, with a well defined turn on point before perihelion, and a well defined\nturn off point after perihelion (confirmation paper I). Using this definition we find that\n2P/Encke is a normal comet.\n2) From the secular light curves we measure the following parameters for the perihelion\nactivity or coma phase (Source 1): The location of the turn on and turn off points of activity\nare RON= -1.63\u00b10.03 AU, ROFF= +1.49\u00b10.20 AU, TON= -87\u00b15 d, TOFF= +94\u00b115 d, the time\nlag, LAG(q)= 6\u00b11 d, the total active time, TACTIVITY= 181\u00b116 d, and the amplitude of the\nsecular light curve, ASEC(1,1) = 4.8\u00b10.2 mag.\n3) From this information the photometric age and the time-aged defined in papers I and II,\ncan be calculated. Comet 2P/Encke is an old comet, with P-AGE=97\u00b18 comet years, and\nT-AGE= 103\u00b19 comet years.\n\n\f16\n4) The activity at aphelion (Source 2), extends from TON= +160\u00b125 d to TOFF= +975\u00b115 for\na total active time TACTIVITY = 815\u00b130 d and amplitude of the secular light curve ASEC (1,Q)\n= 2.7\u00b10.2 mag. We also find the peak-to-valley amplitude of the rotational light curve at\naphelion, APTV = 0.62\u00b10.08 magnitudes.\n5) We create a new phase diagram based on a reanalysis of older observations, to which\n3 new constrains are imposed: no photographic observations used because they are\ncontaminated by the 3883 A CN line, no observations used beyond the amplitude of the\nrotational light curve, and agreement with aphelion observations where the nucleus should\nbe more visible. We find an absolute magnitude and phase coefficient RN(1,1,0)=\n15.05\u00b10.14, and \u03b2= 0.066\u00b10.003.\nFrom this data we find a nucleus effective diameter\nDEFFE = 5.12(+2.5; -1.7) km not different from previous determinations but with smaller\nerror and satisfying three additional constraints (see text).\n6) The activity of source 1 is due to H2O sublimation because it shows curvature. The\nactivity of source 2 might also be due to H2O due to the circumstantial situation that the\npoles point to the Sun at perihelion and aphelion.\n7) It is concluded that the secular light curve can place constraints on the pole orientation\nof the nucleus of some comets, and we measure the ecliptic longitude of the south pole\nequal to 213.2\u00b14.5o, in excellent agreement with the values from Sekanina (1988b) and\nFestou and Barale (2000), but with smaller error.\n8) We obtained the SLC for 1858 using data from Kamel (1991). We find that at least 7\nphysical parameters have changed since 1858. In particular the photometric age and\ntime-age were found to be P-AGE(1858)= 58\u00b13 cy and T-AGE(1858)= 61\u00b14 cy much\nyounger than current values. This allows the determination of the date of insertion of the\ncomet into the inner solar system and start of activity as 1557\u00b190 AD. Although this\ntimescale for evolution is shorter than previously believed, it is justified in the text.\n9) It is interesting to follow the comet at aphelion closely to verify if the linear decay in\nbrightness between \u2206t = +310 and +393 d after perihelion repeats in the same place at\nother apparitions. This could be an indication of topography. It could also be interesting\nto obtain time series differential photometry of the nucleus at the time of minimum (\u2206t=\n+393 to 412), because this seems to be the absolute minimum brightness of the whole\norbit.\n10) We conclude that 2P/Encke shows secular evolution in seven parameters. The SLC\nhas been shifting in LAG, absolute magnitude, turn on and turn off distances, age, and it is\nchanging shape. For the first time we have been able to achieve an absolute calibration\nof age and it was found that the residence time inside the inner solar system is small, but\nin accord to several calculations. It is also in accord with the small perihelion distance and\npeculiar pole orientation of this comet that produce enhanced aging.\n11) A reinterpretation of the rotational light curves obtained by Lowry and Weissman\n(2007) allows to conclude that the best rotational period for the comet that also fulfills the\nlengthy photometry of Fernandez et al. (2005), is 22.2190 h.\n\n\f17\n12) Using secular information on the absolute magnitude and a theoretical model based\non the sublimation of volatiles, it is possible to predict the extinction time. We find ET=\n2056\u00b13 AD, implying that the comet made 125\u00b112 returns after entering the inner solar\nsystem. This value is in accord with previous estimates.\n13) This comet will have a close approach to Earth in October 17th, 2013 at the cometEarth distance \u2206 = 0.478 AU, when the object will be within reach of radio telescopes and\nwill be a good radar target (Harmon et al., 1999; Harmon and Nolan, 2005).\nThe \"Atlas of Secular Light Curves of Comets\" as well as tables of cometary\nphysical properties is available and are regularly updated at the web site:\nhttp://www.webdelprofesor.ula.ve/ciencias/ferrin.\n\n8.

The magnitudes were R(\u2206,R,\u03b1)=17.0\u00b10.15, V(\u2206,R,\u03b1)=17.44\u00b10.15, R(1,1,\u03b1)=\n16.11\u00b10.15, R(1,1,0)= 15.08\u00b10.15. The image is 5'x6.7' in size. There is an unresolved\ncoma not detected in this rendition.\n\n\f23\n\nFigure 2. Secular light curve of comet 2P/Encke, log plot. The x-axis has been increased\nin Log q = \u00b10.47965 to make room for observations inside the Earth's orbit. The slope 5\nline at the bottom of the plot in the form of a pyramid is due to the atmosphereless\nnucleus. Notice the sharp turn on point, and the activity at aphelion evidenced by\nobservations well above the nuclear line. Although the SLC exhibits almost the same turn\non and turn off distances, the SLC is asymmetric at 1 AU from the Sun, as evidenced by\nthe fact that the absolute magnitude before perihelion, m1B(1,1)= 9.8\u00b10.1, while after\nperihelion is m1A (1,1)= 11.5\u00b10.1, an asymmetry of 1.7\u00b10.15 magnitudes at 1 AU. The\nphotometric age derived from this plot is P-AGE= 97\u00b18 cy (comet years), corresponding to\nan old comet. The mean value <V-R> and pR are taken from the literature cited in the text.\nOur observation was taken +4 days after turn on.\n\n\f24\n\nFigure 3. Secular light curve of comet 2P/Encke, time plot, Source 1. Notice the time\ndelay between maximum brightness and perihelion, LAG. The time-age derived from this\nplot is T-AGE= 103\u00b19 cy, corresponding to an methuselah comet (defined as any comet\nwith 100 cy < P-AGE).\n\n\f25\n\nFigure 4. Secular light curve of comet 2P/Encke, time plot, activity at aphelion, Source 2.\nThe dashed line tries to describe an envelope of the observations but in no way implies\nthat the activity is sustained. Between \u2206t = +310 and +392 d there is a well observed\nlinear decay in brightness that might be indication of topography and is enlarged in Figure\n5. The maximum activity (3.0\u00b10.2 mag) is quite significant. The nuclear magnitude\nderived from the phase plot (Figure 6), is in agreement with the lowest observations at\naphelion by Fernandez et al. (2005) and Meech et al. (2001) at \u2206t= +390 days.\n\n\f26\n\nFigure 5. Comet 2P/Encke, photometric anomaly at aphelion. The anomaly has been\nexpanded from Figure 4 to see its extent and shape. The brightness decreases linearly\nfrom \u2206t = +310 to +392 d after perihelion, an interval of 82 days. There seems to be an\nabsolute minimum of the secular light curve at \u2206t= +393 to 413. The photometric anomaly\ncan be due to a topographic effect or the turn off of an active region. Additional\nobservations of this region are highly desirable at every apparition because this might be\nthe absolute minimum brightness of the whole orbit (not considering the rotational\ncomponent).\n\n\f27\n\nFigure 6. Phase diagram. The best way to determine the absolute magnitude of a comet\nis using the phase diagram. The magnitude at phase angle \u03b1= 0o, is the absolute\nmagnitude RN(1,1,0).\nTo diminish the errors and to increase the robustness of this\ndetermination, we have imposed three new constraints: a) The observations must be\ndevoid of coma (this implies that photographic observations are not included because of\nCN contamination line at 3883 A). b) The observations should lie inside the rotational\namplitude of the nucleus.\nc) The absolute nuclear magnitude RN(1,1,0) must be in\nagreement with the faintest observations made at aphelion. In this way we determine\nRN(1,1,0)= 15.05\u00b10.14, \u03b2= 0.066\u00b10.003. These values are in excellent agreement with\nprevious values, but exhibit smaller errors. The standard deviation (SD) of the\nobservations is in excellent agreement with the amplitude of the rotational light curve.\nThe correlation coefficient (CC) is very large.\nThis plot is also excellent to determine\ncoma contamination (values well above the phase line). We see that our observation was\nalready coma contaminated in spite of having been made only +4 days after turn on.\nHowever the coma is not apparent in the image (Figure 1). The photometry of Lowry and\nWeissman (2007) is also compromised by an unresolved coma. Notice the extent of the\nphase angle observations that reach to 105o, the largest of any comet\n\n\f28\n\nFigure 7. Data sets of Fernandez et al. (2005) and of Lowry and Weissman (2007) of\nrotational measurements. Means and ranges (vertical bars) have been calculated for\nevery night, and plotted as a function of time. PTV= peak to valley. These observations\nhave been made near aphelion, as can be deduced from the scale below, showing solar\ndistances of +3.56 to +3.95 AU. There are four observing intervals. In the first, third and\nfourth interval (duration 25, 6 and 2 d) the comet remains practically constant in brightness\nwithin \u00b10.1, \u00b10.03 and \u00b10.04 magnitudes. The second interval in the middle (lasting 15 d)\nis much fainter than the other two and exhibits a drop of 1.1 magnitudes in 13 days. The\nlowest night is 1.5 magnitudes below the steady state nights. Notice also that the\namplitude of the rotational light curve is larger for the fainter magnitudes, implying that\nbrighter magnitudes are contaminated by an unresolved coma\n\n\f29\n\nFigure 8. The orbit and activity of comet 2P/Encke, seen from above the orbital plane.\nThe heavy line shows the regions of activity, Source 1 at perihelion, Source 2 at aphelion.\nNotice the turn on of activity in 1858, and 2003. The maximum activity takes place at\nLAG= 6\u00b11 d after perihelion, which can be translated into a true anomaly of +26.7\u00b14.5o.\n\n\f30\n\nFigure 9. The SLC from 1858 compared with the SLC of 2003, Log plot. The data has\nbeen taken from Kamel (1992). The points are the observed brightness. The SLC has\nbeen narrowing with time, a result that is in accord with the time evolution of the comets\npresented in papers I to III.\nIt is possible to derive a photometric age for this Epoch.\nCompare with Figure 2. Seven physical parameters show evolution with respect to 2003\n\n\f31\n\nFigure 10. SLC from 1858 compared with the SLC of 2003, time plot. It can be\nascertained that the SLC changed shape. The SLC has been narrowing with time, a\nresult that is in accord with the time evolution of the comets presented in papers I to III.\nCompare with Figure 3.\n\n\f32\n\nFigure 11. Absolute calibration of age. It can be seen that the two ages, P-AGE and TAGE, give practically the same zero-age-date, ZAD = 1645\u00b140 AD. This is not the birth\ndate of the comet, but the effective time at which it began sublimating. However the final\nmeaning of this ZAD is still a matter of interpretation\n\n\f33\n\nFigure 12. The distribution of volatile ices over the nucleus of comet 2P/Encke can be\ndeduced from Figure 8, if the pole is near the orbital plane. It can be seen that source 1\noccupies the southern hemisphere, while source 2 occupies the north pole. However due\nto the fact that Source 2 is active at aphelion, the active time is much larger than for\nSource 1.\nIn the context of this investigation \"a source\" may include several active\nregions lumped together rather than a surface sublimating on every square inch.\n\n\f34\n\nFigure 13. Extinction date of comet 2P/Encke. The secular absolute magnitudes have\nbeen plotted as a function of time and fitted with a suitable theoretical model assuming\nthat the comet dies by sublimation. The original data set has been moved upward by -0.6\nmag because the authors Ferrin and Gil (1988) took the mean values of the observations,\nwhile we now know that the envelope is the correct interpretation. Notice that with this\ncorrection, the absolute magnitude of the comet in the data sets of Ferr\u00edn and Gil and\nKamel, coincide in 1858. An extinction date can then be deduced, and we find that ED =\n2056\u00b13 AD. This implies a total number of 125\u00b112 revolutions since it entered the inner\nsolar system. Notice the narrow range of models that fit the observations. The aging\nrate per apparition is accelerating and reaching a value easily measured by photometry.\nThus this is a useful model because it can be tested.\n\n\f"}
