The quasar was discovered in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000;\nAbazajian et al. 2004), and the lensing hypothesis was\nconfirmed by subsequent observations with the Subaru\n8.2-m telescope and the Keck telescope. The system consists of four lensed quasar components (i\u2032 =18.5, 18.9,\n19.4, and 20.1) at z = 1.734 and the maximum separation angle between the lensed images is 14.\u2032\u2032 62. The lensing object must be a massive object, such as a cluster of\n*\n\nBased on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space\nTelescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute,\nwhich is operated by the Association of Universities for Research\nin Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These\nobservations are associated with HST program 9744.\n\ngalaxies, to produce such a large image separation; indeed,\nwe have identified a z = 0.68 cluster centered among the\nfour lensed images. The discovery of a single, cluster-size\nlensed quasar among the current SDSS quasars is consistent with the theoretical expectation of lensing based on\nthe cold dark matter model (Oguri et al. 2004; Oguri &\nKeeton 2004).\nSDSS J1004+4112 is unique in the sense that 1) the\nquadruple images place robust constraints on the innermost region of the lensing cluster, and 2) the lensing cluster is a strong lensing selected cluster of galaxies. These\nfeatures indicate that the mass modeling of this lens system may offer valuable information on the structure of\nclusters of galaxies. The first attempt at modeling the\nsystem with various parametric models revealed the elongated and complicated mass distribution of the lensing\ncluster (Oguri et al. 2004). Williams & Saha (2004) recently studied this system using a free-form reconstruction technique and reached similar conclusions. However,\nimportant degeneracies between different models remain,\nand further follow-up observations are required to deter-\n\n\f2\n\nINADA ET AL.\n\nmine the mass distribution more precisely.\nObservations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\ncan offer such new data. In particular, high-resolution\nHST images could be quite effective at detecting lensed\nimages of the quasar host galaxy, arc or arclet images\nof other lensed sources, and perhaps a central or \"odd\"\nimage of the lensed quasar system that would be expected theoretically (e.g., Burke 1981; Rusin 2002). A\ncentral image is especially useful for providing tight constraints on the central mass distribution of the lensing\nobject. This was indeed demonstrated by the first discovery of a central image in a lensed quasar system; Winn,\nRusin, & Kochanek (2004) showed that the central image\nof PMN J1632\u22120033 requires \u03b2 = 1.91 \u00b1 0.02 (2\u03c3 confidence) when a power-law density profile \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b2 is assumed. Possible central images have also been identified in\nlensed arc systems, such as CL 0024+1654 (Colley, Tyson,\n& Turner 1996), MS 2137.3\u22122353 (Gavazzi et al. 2003),\nand A1689 (Broadhurst et al. 2005), and they also provide\nimportant constraints on mass models (see, e.g., Gavazzi\net al. 2003).\nIn this letter, we present an identification of a\nfifth image of the lensed quasar with the Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS; Clampin 2000) and the\nNear Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer\n(NICMOS; Thompson 1992) installed on the HST. In addition, we report unambiguous detection of the lensed host\ngalaxy in the NICMOS image.\n2.\n\nThe ACS Observation\n\nAn ACS observation (with the Wide Field Channel) in\nthe F814W filter (\u2248I-band) was conducted on 2004 April\n28, under the program \"HST Imaging of Gravitational\nLenses\" (GO-9744, PI C. Kochanek). The observation\nconsisted of five dithered exposures taken in ACCUM\nmode. The total exposure time was 405 seconds. The\nreduced (drizzled and calibrated) images were extracted\nusing the CALACS pipeline (Hack 1999), which includes\nthe PyDrizzle algorithm. We further rejected cosmic rays\nusing the L.A.Cosmic package (van Dokkum 2001) in the\ndrizzled image. A 40\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 subsection of a median of\nthe five dithered images is shown in Figure 1. Following\nFigure 9 of Oguri et al. (2004), the four lensed components\nare denoted as \"A\u2013D\", and three central bright galaxies\nof the lensing cluster are denoted as \"G1\u2013G3\". The redshifts of galaxies G1\u2013G3 are 0.680, 0.675, and 0.675, respectively (Oguri et al. 2004). The relative positions of\ncomponents A\u2013D were calculated by a single Gaussian fit,\nand the flux ratios of components A\u2013D were estimated by\nfitting the PSF stars produced by the Tiny Tim software\n(version 6.1a; Krist & Hook 2003), in the drizzled (and\ncosmic ray rejected) image. The PSF of a quasar was\nconstructed with an \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.5 power law spectrum in the\nF814W wavelength region (corresponding to \u223c3000 \u00c5 in\nthe rest frame). The relative positions derived from the\nACS (F814W) are consistent with those derived from the\nSubaru i\u2032 band image (Oguri et al. 2004) within \u223c5\u03c3. The\nfour components are all unsaturated, and the AB magni-\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nTable 1.

The error of component E might be much larger due to the over-subtraction of G1.\n\ntude of component A in the F814W filter is estimated to\nbe 18.4. The position of component G1 was extracted by\nthe Source Extractor algorithm (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).\nThe results are summarized in Table 1.\n3.\n\nThe NICMOS Observation\n\nThe NICMOS imaging observation was also conducted\nunder the same HST program on 2004 October 9. The\nobservation consists of four dithered exposures taken in\nMULTIACCUM mode, using the F160W filter (\u2248Hband). The exposure time was 640 sec for two of the\nexposures and 704 sec for the other two. The calibration\nwas extracted by the CALNICA pipeline, and the central bad columns of each dithered image were corrected\nby linear interpolation. The combined image is shown in\nFigure 2. First, we confirm a galaxy near component A\n(marked as G4 in Figure 2), which may host the star or\nstars responsible for microlensing of the broad emission\nline region (Richards et al. 2004). In addition, extended\nemission is clearly seen around components A, B and C.\nAlthough such extensions are also seen in the ACS images (see Figure 1), their existence is much more robust\nin the NICMOS image. The fact that these extensions are\nobvious in the F160W (near-infrared) image and faint in\nthe F814W (optical) image, and that the distortions agree\nwith the theoretical critical curves (see Figure 17 of Oguri\net al. 2004), demonstrates that the extended flux is due to\nthe lensed host galaxy of the source quasar. These images\nprovide many new constraints on lens models that will significantly improve our ability to determine the mass distribution of the lensing cluster. They do make lens modeling more computationally intensive (because one must\naccount for the intrinsic shape of the host galaxy, and also\nfor the effects of the point spread function), so we defer\ndetailed modeling of the arcs to a subsequent paper.\n4.\n\nFifth Image\n\nOf interest is the existence of a point source near the\ncenter of G1. The left panel in Figure 3 shows the ACS image of galaxy G1; what appears to be an unresolved source\nis clearly seen approximately 0.\u2032\u2032 2 northwest of the center\nof G1.

The four quasar images are labeled A\u2013D. The\ngalaxies of the lensing cluster labeled G1\u2013G3 have redshifts of 0.680, 0.675, and 0.675, respectively.

The right panel\nin Figure 3 displays the image after subtracting the signal\nfrom G1 (modeled with the GALFIT package of Peng et\nal. 2002). Due to the existence of the unresolved source\nnear the center of G1 (the peak flux of this unresolved\nsource is almost same as that of G1), G1 was slightly\nover-subtracted. However, we can see a new source, labeled E, in the subtracted image. This object is classified\nas a point source by the Source Extractor algorithm. The\nposition and brightness of E, based on a single Gaussian\nfit to the data, are given in Table 1.\nWe find component E also in the NICMOS image; the\nleft panel in Figure 4 is the NICMOS image of galaxy\nG1. We subtracted the signal from G1 using the GALFIT\npackage, which is shown in the right panel of Figure 4.\nWe confirm component E in the subtracted image, although G1 was slightly over-subtracted as in the ACS\nimage. Measuring the flux of component E with a single Gaussian fit, we find that the flux ratios between E\nand A (E/A) in the ACS and NICMOS images are 0.003\nand 0.004, respectively. This remarkable agreement of the\nflux ratios supports the idea that the point source is a fifth\nimage of the lensed quasar.\nTo test this hypothesis, we have refined the lens models\npresented in Oguri et al. (2004) using the more precise\nHST data. The models consist of a singular isothermal\nellipsoid mass distribution for galaxy G1, and an NFW\n(Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997) elliptical potential for the\ncluster. We demand that the models reproduce the rela-\n\ntive positions and brightnesses of components A\u2013D (and\nthe relative position of G1), as well as the position of\ncomponent E; we do not use the brightness of E as a constraint, because we want to see what the models predict.\nAdopting the same approach as Oguri et al. (2004), we\nuse the lensmodel software (Keeton 2001) for Monte Carlo\nsampling of the parameter space. There is a wide range\nof models consistent with the data, indicating that it is\nnot difficult to produce a 5-image lens matching the configuration of components A\u2013E, and that significant model\ndegeneracies remain. More interesting are the model predictions for the flux ratio between the fifth image and\ncomponent A, shown in Figure 5. The predictions span\na remarkable nine orders of magnitude, from E/A \u223c 0.1\ndown to E/A \u223c 10\u221210 , but a significant fraction predict\nE/A in the range 0.001\u20130.01, consistent with the observed\nvalue. In other words, there are (many) reasonable models that can fit all of the HST data under the hypothesis\nthat E is a fifth image; conversely, the observed properties\nof E are highly compatible with that hypothesis.\nGiven the enormous range of model predictions for the\nbrightness of E, it appears that the observed brightness\noffers strong constraints on the models. We caution that\none must be careful in using the brightness of E as a constraint, because its measured flux could be contaminated\nby improper subtraction of the galaxy or by physical effects such as microlensing or extinction. Nevertheless, the\nrange of predictions is so large that even conservative estimates of systematic uncertainties should still yield very\n\n\f4\n\nINADA ET AL.\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nFig. 4.

As an example, to test the ability\nof E to constrain the central density profile of G1, we\nswitch from an isothermal model to a more general power\nlaw density profile \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b2 for the galaxy (for computational simplicity, we now assume that the potential,\nrather than the density, has elliptical symmetry). We find\nthat there is a wide range of models with 1.6 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 2.0\n<\nthat predict 0.001 <\n\u223c E/A \u223c 0.01. By contrast, all of the\n\u221210\nmodels we examined with \u03b2 \u2265 2.1 predict E/A <\n\u223c 10 ,\nwhich grossly contradicts even a conservative reading of\nthe data. In other words, the observed properties of E imply that the galaxy mass distribution cannot be steeper\nthan isothermal (i.e., \u03b2 \u2264 2). This upper bound is similar\nto that found by Winn, Rusin, & Kochanek (2004) from\nthe central image in PMN J1632\u22120033 (specifically, they\nfound \u03b2 = 1.91 \u00b1 0.02). However, SDSS J1004+4112 differs from PMN J1632\u22120033 in that we do not obtain any\n\nlower bound on \u03b2, at least over the range 1.6 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 2.0\nthat we have explored so far. Apparently the complexity\nof the SDSS J1004+4112 lens potential, with a cluster in\naddition to the galaxy, prevents a unique measurement\nof the value of \u03b2. Nevertheless, it is clear that component E provides important new constraints on the mass\ndistribution of this interesting lens system.\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented the HST ACS and NICMOS images\nof SDSS J1004+4112, which reveal a fifth image of the\nlensed quasar core. The fifth image offers a unique probe\nof the mass distribution of the cluster core. Deep spectroscopic observations of component E with large telescopes,\nsuch as the Subaru Telescope, offer the best prospect for\nthe final confirmation that it is a lensed quasar image. In\nthe NICMOS image, we also found unambiguous evidence\nof the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar. These\nextended images provide strong additional constraints on\nmass models of the lensing cluster, which are expected to\nbreak degeneracies seen in the modeling studies to date. A\ndetailed analysis of lens models including the host galaxy\nimages is underway and will be presented elsewhere.\nA portion of this work was supported by NASA HSTGO-09744.20.
