The calculated elastic and total reaction cross sections are in\ngood agreement with the experimental data, while the CDCC calculation based on the di-neutron model of 6 He,\ni.e., the 2 n+4 He+209 Bi three-body model, does not reproduce the data.\nPACS numbers: 21.45.+v, 24.10.Eq, 25.60.-t, 25.70.De\n\nIn the recent measurements of 6 He+209 Bi scattering at 19\nand 22.5 MeV near the Coulomb barrier energy [1, 2], large\nenhancement of the \u03b1-emission cross section, which dominated the total reaction cross section, compared with that for\nthe corresponding 6 Li-induced reactions was reported. In order to clarify the nature of the enhancement, Keeley et al. [3]\nanalyzed the scattering by means of the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels method (CDCC) [4, 6, 7] that is a fully\nquantum-mechanical method for describing scattering of a\nthree-body system. In the analysis, the 6 He+209 Bi system was\nassumed to be the 2 n+4 He+209 Bi three-body system, that is,\nthe neutron pair in 6 He was treated as a single particle, dineutron (2 n). They found that the enhancement of the total\nreaction cross section of the 6 He+209 Bi scattering was due\nto the electric dipole (E1) excitation of 6 He to its continuum\nstates, i.e. Coulomb breakup processes of 6 He, which was\napproximately absent in the 6 Li+209 Bi scattering case. Their\ncalculation, however, did not reproduce the angular distribution of the measured elastic cross section and overestimated\nthe measured total reaction cross section by a factor of three.\nThus, reaction mechanisms of the 6 He+209 Bi scattering are\nnot fully understood.\nIn the very recent work [8], it was reported that the elastic\ncross sections of the 6 He+209 Bi scattering calculated within\nthe same framework as in Ref. [3] with the strength of\nthe dipole coupling potentials multiplied by 0.5 reproduced\nthe experimental data. This indicates that the E1 excitation strength of 6 He cannot be accurately reproduced by\nthe 2 n+4 He model. Since 6 He is well known as a twoneutron halo nucleus, its structure should be described by\nthe n+n+4 He three-body system rather than the 2 n+4 He twobody one. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the 6 He+209 Bi scattering by using the n+n+4 He+209 Bi four-body model. Furthermore, a fully quantum-mechanical method such as CDCC\nis highly required to analyze the scattering near the Coulomb\nbarrier energies in which both nuclear and Coulomb breakup\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: taku2scp@rarfaxp.riken.jp\n\nprocesses are significant.\nIn our previous work [9], we proposed four-body CDCC\nthat is the extension of CDCC and describes four-body\nbreakup processes. In four-body CDCC, the three-body\nbreakup continuum of the projectile is discretized by diagonalizing the internal Hamiltonian in a space spanned by the\nGaussian basis functions. So far the Gaussian basis function was used with success for solving bound-state problems of few-body systems. The approach is called the Gaussian expansion method (GEM) [10]. The application of\nthe Gaussian basis function to the discretization of breakup\ncontinuum is a natural extension of GEM. In general, the\nmethod that describes the breakup continuum by a superposition of L2 -type basis functions is called the pseudostate\nmethod [11], and other basis functions have been also proposed so far [12, 13, 14]. Four-body CDCC was successfully applied to 6 He+12 C scattering at 18 and 229.8 MeV in\nwhich only nuclear breakup was significant. The elastic and\nbreakup cross sections calculated with four-body CDCC are\nfound to converge as the number of Gaussian basis functions\nis increased [9]. This indicates that the set of discretized continuum states obtained by the pseudostate method with GEM\nforms an complete set with good accuracy in a finite region\nof space that is important for the four-body reaction process\nconcerned. Furthermore, in Ref. [15], applicability of CDCC\nwith the pseudostate method to Coulomb breakup processes,\nin which large modelspace of the projectile is required because of the long-range property of Coulomb coupling potentials, was shown for the 8 B+58 Ni scattering at 25.8 MeV.\nThus, it is expected that four-body CDCC with GEM accurately describes the 6 He+209 Bi scattering near the Coulomb\nbarrier energy.\nIn this Rapid Communication, we analyze 6 He+209 Bi scattering at 19 and 22.5 MeV by means of four-body CDCC. This\nis the first application of four-body CDCC to low-energy scattering in which both nuclear and Coulomb breakup processes\nare significant. We show that four-body CDCC reproduces\nthe measured elastic and total reaction cross sections reasonably well. Effects of four-body breakup processes on the elastic scattering are investigated through the dynamical polariza-\n\n\f2\ntion (DP) potential. We discuss the reason why the di-neutron\nmodel of 6 He is insufficient to describe the 6 He+209 Bi scattering.\nWe assume that the 6 He+209 Bi scattering is described as the\nn+n+4 He+209 Bi four-body system.

It should be noted that U\u03b1Bi contains a\nCoulomb part that causes Coulomb breakup processes in the\n6\nHe+209 Bi scattering. In four-body CDCC, the total wave\nfunction of the four-body system is expanded in terms of a\nfinite number of the internal wave functions of the 6 He projectile. The internal wave functions including the bound and\ndiscretized-continuum states are generated with GEM as mentioned above.

Meanwhile, the\nexchange between each valence neutron and each nucleon in\n4\nHe is treated approximately by the orthogonality condition\nmodel [16]. The eigenenergies \u01ebnI of 6 He and the correspond(c)nI\ning expansion-coefficients Ai\u03bbjl\u039bS are determined by diagonalizing H6 [17, 18].\nUsing the internal states of 6 He thus obtained, we expand\nthe total wave function of the n+n+4 He+209 Bi four-body system with the total angular momentum J and its projection on\n\nand \u03bc is the reduced mass between 6 He and 209 Bi. We obtain\nthe elastic and discrete breakup S-matrix elements by solving Eq. (7) under an appropriate asymptotic boundary condition [4, 19]. Details of the formalism of CDCC are shown in\nRef. [4].\nTABLE I: The maximum internal angular momenta and the Gaussian\nrange parameters for each Jacobi coordinate.\nc I \u03c0 \u03bbmax lmax \u02331 [fm] \u0233max [fm] r\u03041 [fm] r\u0304max [fm]\n3\n1,2\n3\n1,2\n3\n1,2\n\n0+\n0+\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\n2+\n2+\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n0.1\n0.5\n0.1\n0.5\n0.1\n0.5\n\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\n\nIn the present four-body CDCC calculation for 6 He+209 Bi\nscattering at 19 and 22.5 MeV, we take I \u03c0 = 0+ , 1\u2212 , and 2+\nstates for 6 He.

The experimental data are\ntaken from Ref. [1, 2].

It should be noted that the maximum value of each\nGaussian range parameter is 15 fm, which is quite larger than\nthat used in the four-body CDCC analysis of 6 He nuclear\nbreakup [9], i.e. 10 fm. Some parameters shown in Table I\ndepend on I \u03c0 and c, while in Eqs. (3)\u2013(5) the dependence has\nnot been shown for simplicity.\nWe select the \u03a6nIm with \u01ebnI \u2264 7 MeV among those obtained by diagonalizing H6 and use them in actual CDCC calculation, since the \u03a6nIm with \u01ebnI > 7 MeV are found to have\nno effect on the calculated cross sections of the 6 He+209 Bi\nscattering shown below. The resulting number of the discrete\nstates for the 0+ , 1\u2212 , and 2+ states is 37 (including the ground\nstate of 6 He), 44, and 53, respectively. As for the nuclear parts\nof UnBi and U\u03b1Bi , respectively, we take the optical potentials\nof Koning and Delaroche [20] and of Barnett and Lilley [21].\nThe maximum value of L is taken to be 200 and the scattering\nwave function \u03c7J\u03b3 is connected to its appropriate asymptotic\nform at R = 200 fm.\nBelow we show also results of CDCC calculation based\non the 2 n+4 He+209 Bi three-body model to see three-body\nbreakup effects on the elastic and total reaction cross sections. In this model the di-neutron (2 n) model of 6 He is used\nand the intrinsic spin and the relative energy of 2 n are assumed to be zero. We henceforth call CDCC based on the\nmodel above three-body CDCC. As for the interaction between 2 n and 4 He, we take the same parameter as used in\nRef. [3]. The 2 n+4 He continuum is discretized by the pseudostate method described in Ref. [11] and truncated at the relative momentum k = 0.7 fm\u22121 that corresponds to about 7\nMeV of the excitation energy of 6 He. The number of the\ndiscrete state is 9 for each of the 0+ , 1\u2212 , and 2+ states of\n6\nHe. The range parameters of the Gaussian basis functions\nare (a1 = 0.5 fm, ana = 20.0 fm, na = 20) with the same\nnotation as in Ref. [11]. We adopt the optical potential of\nBarnett and Lilley [21] for the nuclear part of U\u03b1Bi , as in the\nfour-body CDCC calculation, and the d-208 Pb (type-a) optical\npotential at the deuteron incident energy of 15.0 MeV [22] for\nthe interaction between 2 n and 209 Bi. Other parameters of the\nmodelspace are the same as in the four-body CDCC calculation.\nFigure 2 shows the angular distribution of the elastic differential cross section for the 6 He+209 Bi scattering at 19 MeV.\nThe solid line is the result of four-body CDCC and the dashed\nline is that of three-body CDCC. The results of four-body\nCDCC and three-body CDCC without breakup effects of 6 He\nare shown by the dotted and dot-dashed lines, respectively.\nThe difference between the solid and dotted (dashed and dotdashed) lines shows effects of the four-body (three-body)\nbreakup on the elastic cross section.

The solid and open\ncircles represent the results of the four-body CDCC calculation and\nthe three-body CDCC calculation, respectively. The experimental\ndata shown by the open and solid squares are taken from Ref. [1];\nsee the text for details.\n\nthe fusion cross sections [23], while the solid squares are the\ntotal reaction cross sections evaluated from an optical-model\nanalysis of the measured elastic cross sections [1]. The figure\nshows that three-body CDCC overestimates the experimental\ndata by a factor of about three. This overestimation is consistent with the fact that three-body CDCC underestimates the\nelastic cross section as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. On the contrary, four-body CDCC reproduces the experimental data quite\nwell, which shows the importance of the accurate description of three-body breakup continuum of 6 He. The remaining difference of about a few tens of % between the results\nof four-body CDCC and the data needs further investigation,\nincluding analysis of 6 He+208 Pb scattering in barrier-energy\nregion [24].\nIn order to clarify the reason why the total reaction cross\nsection calculated with three-body CDCC is much larger than\nthat with four-body CDCC, we see first the strength of E1\ntransition based on the two models. The non-energy weighted\nE1 excitation strength B(E1) from the ground state \u03a6000 of\n6\nHe to its excited states \u03a6nIm with I = 1 is given by\n\u0012 \u00132 X X\n2\nB(E1) =\n|h\u03a6n1m |y3 Y1\u03bc (\u01773 )|\u03a6000 i|2 . (8)\n3\nn \u03bc,m\nThe summation over n is taken up to a value that corresponds\nto the excitation energy of 6 He of 7 MeV, i.e. the maximum\nenergy of the modelspace of the present analysis. The resulting values of B(E1) based on the 2 n+4 He model and the\nn+n+4 He model are, respectively, 1.5 e2 fm2 and 0.9 e2 fm2 .\nThe latter agrees well with the experimental value reported by\nAumann et al. [25], which is consistent with the conclusion\nin Ref. [26]. Thus, the E1 strength is overestimated in the\ndi-neutron model. This indicates that the di-neutron model\n\nand\nJ\nJ\nUeq\n(R) \u2261 UDP\n(R) + U\u03b30 \u03b30 (R),\n\nwhere the subscript 0 denotes the incident channel.\n6\n\n209\n\nHe+ Bi at 22.5 MeV\n( J = 10 )\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\nJ\n\n\u03c3reac [mb]\n\n3\n\n10\n\novershoots the breakup cross section of the 6 He+209 Bi scattering, which is the main reason why three-body CDCC overestimates the result of four-body CDCC, hence the measured\ntotal reaction cross section. This conclusion is qualitatively\nconsistent with that drawn in Ref. [8], in which, as mentioned\nabove, three-body CDCC with the strength of the dipole coupling potentials multiplied by 0.5 was shown to reproduce the\nelastic scattering data of the 6 He+209 Bi scattering.\nNext we discuss the difference of the optical potentials taken in the 2 n+4 He+209 Bi three-body model and the\nn+n+4 He+209 Bi four-body model. As one sees in Figs. 2 and\n3, the elastic cross section without breakup effects calculated\nwith the three-body model underestimates that with the fourbody model. This means that the diagonal component of the\nimaginary potential in the elastic channel based on the threebody model is deeper than that on the four-body model. Thus,\nthe three-body model yields an absorption cross section larger\nthan the four-body model does. This is also an important factor for the enhancement of the total reaction cross section calculated with three-body CDCC.\nFinally, we see the difference between three-body CDCC\nand four-body CDCC in more detail by evaluating the dynamJ\nical polarization (DP) potential UDP\nand the equivalent local\nJ\npotential Ueq (R). Explicit form of the two potentials is given\nby\nP\nJ\n\u03b36=\u03b30 U\u03b3\u03b30 (R)\u03c7\u03b3 (PnI , R)\nJ\nUDP (R) =\n(9)\n\u03c7J\u03b30 (P0I0 , R)\n\nWDP (R) [MeV]\n\n4\n\n10\n\nJ(4)\n\nWDP\n\nJ(3)\n\nWDP\n\n\u22120.4\n\nJ(4)\n\nWeq\n\nJ(3)\n\nWeq\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nR [fm]\nFIG. 5: The imaginary parts of the dynamical polarization (DP) potential and the equivalent local potential for the 6 He+209 Bi scattering at 22.5 MeV with J = 10.

The dashed and dotted-dash lines\ncorrespond to those calculated with three-body CDCC based on the\ndi-neutron model of 6 He.\nJ(4)\n\nJ(3)\n\nFigure 5 shows the imaginary parts WDP and WDP of\ncalculated with four-body CDCC (solid line) and three-\n\nJ\nUDP\n\n\f5\nbody CDCC (dashed line), respectively, for the 6 He+209 Bi\nscattering at 22.5 MeV. Also shown are the results of the imagJ\ninary parts of Ueq\ncalculated with four-body and three-body\nJ(4)\n\nJ(3)\n\nCDCC, i.e. Weq and Weq . It should be noted that the figure shows the potentials only in the peripheral region, i.e., 10\nfm \u2264 R \u2264 30 fm, where the scattering wave has nonnegligible values. The results correspond to J = 10 at which the partial reaction cross section becomes maximum. It is confirmed\nthat the DP potential hardly depends on J around J = 10 in\nthe peripheral region shown in Fig. 5. It should be noted that\nJ\nJ\nUDP\ndefined by Eq. (9), or Ueq\n(R), is not a smooth function\nsince it is divided by the oscillating function \u03c7J\u03b30 . Each line in\nJ\nJ\nFig. 5 is obtained by interpolation of UDP\n(R) (or Ueq\n(R)) at\nR where |\u03c7J\u03b30 | is more than 90% of its maximum value in the\nJ\nasymptotic region; this simple way of evaluating UDP\n(R) and\nJ\nUeq (R) is appropriate for the present purpose. The S-matrix\nelement calculated with the interpolated DP potential reproduces the one obtained by CDCC within the relative error of\n3%.\nJ(3)\nJ(4)\nOne sees from Fig. 5 that both WDP and WDP have a\nlong ranged tail, which is induced by Coulomb breakup processes. In the tail region of R \u2265 15 fm, where the imagiJ\nJ\nagrees with Weq\n,\nnary part of U\u03b30 \u03b30 is negligible and WDP\nJ(3)\n\nJ(4)\n\nWDP is deeper than WDP . This is consistent with the fact\nmentioned above that the strength of E1 transition is overestimated by the di-neutron model of 6 He, which is used in the\nJ(3)\nthree-body CDCC calculation. On the other hand, WDP is\nJ(4)\nshallower than WDP in the region of R \u2264 15 fm. However, the imaginary part of U\u03b30 \u03b30 calculated with three-body\nCDCC is, as mentioned above, much deeper than that with\nJ(3)\nJ(4)\nfour-body CDCC, which makes Weq deeper than Weq in\nthis region. Thus, the imaginary part of the equivalent local potential, which dictates the total reaction cross section,\ncalculated with three-body CDCC is deeper than that with\nfour-body CDCC in the entire region that is important for the\n6\nHe+209 Bi scattering concerned. This conclusion is consistent with the discussion above and the result shown in Fig. 4.\nJ\nThe real part VDP\nof the DP potential also plays impor6\nJ\ntant roles in the He+209 Bi scattering.

The difference between VDP\ncalculated with three-body CDCC and four-body CDCC in the\nJ\nouter region is just the same as for WDP\nshown in Fig. 5.\nIn summary, the 6 He+209 Bi scattering at 19 MeV and\n22.5 MeV, near the Coulomb barrier energy, is analyzed with\nthe continuum-discretized coupled-channels method (CDCC)\nbased on the n+n+4 He+209 Bi four-body model, four-body\nCDCC, that treats both nuclear and Coulomb breakup processes simultaneously. It is found that the angular distribution of the elastic cross section and the total reaction cross\nsection calculated with four-body CDCC reasonably reproduce the experimental data with no free adjustable parameter. Three-body CDCC based on the 2 n+4 He+209 Bi threebody model, i.e. di-neutron model of 6 He, turns out to overestimate the total reaction cross section by a factor of about\nthree, which is consistent with the conclusion of the previous work of Keeley et al. [3]. The value of B(E1) calculated by the di-neutron model overestimates the experimental one, while the n+n+4 He three-body model reproduces the\ndata well, as pointed out in Ref. [8]. This makes the imaginary\npart of the dynamical polarization potential calculated with\nthree-body CDCC deeper than that with four-body CDCC in\nthe tail region. Also important fact is that three-body CDCC\ncontains a deep imaginary part of the diagonal potential for\nthe elastic channel compared with four-body CDCC does. We\nthus conclude that the di-neutron model is inadequate to treat\nbreakup continuum of 6 He precisely and a n+n+4 He+209 Bi\nfour-body reaction model is necessary to accurately describe\nthe 6 He+209 Bi scattering. Four-body CDCC is indispensable\nto analyze low energy 6 He scattering in which both nuclear\nand Coulomb breakup processes are significant.\nThe authors would like to thank E.
