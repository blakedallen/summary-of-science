Introduction\nDiffractive DIS appears to be a unique probe of the internal structure\nof hadrons in the Regge regime, i.e. at Q2 fixed, x \u2192 0. It has been always\nappreciated that diffractive processes can give valuable information of the\ngluon content inside a rapidly moving proton. Another aspect might not be\nthat obvious, namely, that diffraction can tell us much about the structure\nof the produced system as well.\nThe case of the vector meson production\n\u03b3 (\u2217) p \u2192 V p\n\u2217\n\nPresented at X International Workshop on Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS2002) Cracow, Poland, 30 April - 4 May 2002\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nivanov\n\nprinted on December 9, 2018\n\nis especially promising. A general expression for transition \u03b3 (\u2217) (\u03bb\u03b3 ) \u2192\nV (\u03bbV ) is given by:\n\u221a\nZ\nZ\ndz\ncV 4\u03c0\u03b1em 1\n2 ~\nd2~k\u03c8(z, ~k)\nA(x, Q , \u2206) = is\n4\u03c0 2\n0 z(1 \u2212 z)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 2\nd ~\u03ba\n\u03c0 \u2202\n2\n~ * I(\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 V )\n*\n\u03b1S (q ) 1 + i\nF(x, \u03be, ~\u03ba, \u2206)\n~\u03ba4\n2 \u2202 log x\nHere we have two quantities that are not calculable within pQCD, namely,\nthe radial wave function of the vector meson \u03c8(z, ~k) and the off-forward\n~\nunintegrated gluon density F(x, \u03be, ~\u03ba, \u2206).\nBy studying the properties of the production of vector mesons with\nhelicity \u03bbV from photons with helicity \u03bb\u03b3 , one can peep into the spin-angular\nstructure of the quarks inside the vector meson. Indeed, even the mere fact\nthat helicity-flip \u03b3 \u2192 V transitions take place implies a certain motion of\nthe constituents inside the meson.\nIt turns out that the distribution of the absolute values of the relative\nmomenta between the quark and the antiquark inside the vector meson, the\nquantity that we just called the wave function of the vector meson, does\nleave signatures in the properties of the diffractive production as well. In\nour work we do not aim at the most accurate possible way of describing the\nvector meson wave function. What we do is we take two radically different\nAns\u00e4tze - the Coulomb and the oscillator type - for the wave function and\ncheck how different the predictions based on the form of the wave function\nare. This will give us a reliable estimate of the sensitivity of the whole\napproach to the details of the wave function.\n2. Unintegrated gluon density\nAlthough the unintegrated gluon structure function is not calculable\nfrom first principles, it can be extracted from experimental data on F2p .\nThis analysis was performed in [1] and yielded compact and ready-to-use\nparametrizations of F(x, ~\u03ba2 ). Since this analysis was based on simple eyeball fits and because new data appeared during last two years, we reextracted the unintegrated gluon density from F2p , this time by means of\n\u03c72 -minimization. We used 191 data points in low to moderate Q2 (Q2 < 10\nGeV2 ), x < 0.01 region and obtained three fits with \u03c72 /nd.o.f. \u2248 1.25 \u00f7 1.40.\nWe hope that later on, when calculating vector meson production cross sections, using these three fits will give us a reliable estimate of the level of\nuncertainty introduced by unintegrated glue.\nThis minimization procedure resulted in somewhat unexpected two-peak\nshape of the unintegrated glue, which means that the soft and hard components of the pomeron are strongly separated. Further analysis is needed\n\n\fivanov\n\nprinted on December 9, 2018\n\n3\n\nin order to establish whether the data indeed favor the non-monotonous\n~\u03ba2 -behavior of F(x, ~\u03ba2 ) or this is an artefact.\n3. Production of ground state mesons\nThe kt -factorization calculations of the vector meson production cross\nsection are known to possess a scaling phenomenon: all ground state vector\nmesons, when corrected to flavor factor, follow the same Q2 + m2V dependence. Moreover, we predict that a similar phenomenon should take place\nalso for the energy rise exponent and for the diffractive slope.\n\n14000\n\n12000\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\nFig. 1. The \u03c1 meson production cross section multiplied by (Q2 + m2\u03c1 )2.3 . Discrepancies at Q2 \u223c 1 GeV2 and at Q2 > 10 GeV2 can be clearly seen.\n\nWhen calculating the production of \u03c1-meson and comparing them with\nthe data, we observed a good overall agreement except for two Q2 regions.\nFig.1 display the quantity \u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 \u03c1p) * (Q2 + m2\u03c1 )2.3 . At low Q2 we\nobserve the experimental data points drop sharply, while our predictions do\nnot exhibit this behavior. It must be emphasized that this discrepancy is\nlocated at Q2 \u223c 1 GeV2 , not at very small Q2 . In fact, with oscillator wave\nfunction, we managed to reproduce the Q2 \u2192 0 behavior of the total cross\nsection nearly perfectly.\nAt large enough Q2 we observe another deviation between kt -factorization\nprediction and the data. As seen in Fig.1, at high Q2 both our predictions\n\n\f4\n\nivanov\n\nprinted on December 9, 2018\n\nfor \u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 \u03c1p) * (Q2 + m2\u03c1 )2.3 and the data decrease, but our curves start\ndecreasing earlier. This problem was dubbed by us the \u03c3T puzzle, since it\nbecomes even more glaring when \u03c3T and \u03c3L are analyzed separately. During the last two years, a number of ideas was investigated - namely, the\neffect of hard Coulomb tail of the wave function and strong S-wave/D-wave\nmixing, see [2] - which could in principle cure this problem. However, no\nsatisfactory solution was found.\nIf we ask not for the absolute values of cross section, but for relative strength of various helicity amplitudes, the agreement between kt factorization prediction and the data is much better. For example, our calculation of the \u03c1-meson spin density matrix and of the ratios spin-flip/nonspin-flip yielded numbers rather close to data points. This make us believe\nthat we grasped the essential part of the spin physics of the diffractive \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1\ntransition.\n\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\n12.5\n\n15\n\n17.5\n\n20\n\nFig. 2. The ratio \u03c3(\u03c6)/\u03c3(\u03c1) as function of Q2 .\n\nIn the case of other ground state vector mesons (\u03c9, \u03c6, J/\u03c8), the kt factorization predictions were in a good overall agreement with the data.\nHere we wish to show one particularly interesting quantity, namely, the ratio\nof \u03c6-meson to \u03c1-meson cross sections, taken at equal Q2 , Fig.2. Aside from\nthe observation that our predictions are in a nice agreement with the data,\nwe notice that predictions based on Coulomb and oscillator wave functions\nvirtually coincide. This is highly non-trivial, since these two Ans\u00e4tze lead\n\n\fivanov\n\nprinted on December 9, 2018\n\n5\n\nto very different absolute values of the cross section. This observation suggests that quantity \u03c3(\u03c6)/\u03c3(\u03c1) is practically insensitive to the details of the\ninternal structure of the vector mesons (provided it is the same for \u03c1 and\n\u03c6). Therefore, in some sense, this quantity appears to be a parameter-free\nprediction of the theory, and the fact that it agrees with the data supports\nour approach. An interesting issue remains to be settled, namely, what is\nthis quantity mostly sensitive to.\n4. Production of excited vector mesons\nSince we explicitly take into account the spin-angular coupling inside\nthe vector meson, we can calculate production of pure S-wave or pure Dwave vector mesons, as well as any given S/D wave mixture. During such\ncalculations, we observed a number of remarkable phenomena. In the case of\n2S states (radial excitations) we observed the famous node effect and studied\nits influence on production cross sections. We observed characteristic Q2 and\nt shape of the (differential) cross sections. Whenever possible, we compared\npredictions with the data and found good agreement. In the case of D wave\nstate we found strong overall suppression that comes from orthogonality\nbetween the pure D wave in vector meson and the dominant S wave in the\ninitial photon.\nWe also calculated the spin density matrices and \u03c3L /\u03c3T ratios for all\nthese states. The most spectacular quantity here is \u03c3L /\u03c3T . For 2S state\nin \u03c1 system, we observed a strongly oscillating Q2 shape of this ratio in\nthe small Q2 region, which is again manifestation of the node effect. For\nD wave state we found an overall suppression of this ration in comparison\nwith 1S state by more than an order of magnitude.\nWe think that study of excited states, especially in the \u03c1 system, will\nshed light on the nature and internal structure of various \u03c1\u2032 resonances. In\nthis aspect, HERA will yield information hadron structure, complementary\nto studied at e+ e\u2212 colliders.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I.P. Ivanov, N.N. Nikolaev, Phys.Rev.D65, 054004 (2002).\n[2] I.P.
