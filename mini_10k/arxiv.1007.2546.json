We address this old CC problem not\nby introducing an extremely fine-tuned counterterm, but in the context of modified\ngravity in the Palatini formalism.

We discuss the filter effect in\nthe epochs of radiation and matter domination as well as in the asymptotic de Sitter\nfuture. The final expansion rate can be much lower than inferred from the large CC\nwithout using a fine-tuned counterterm. Finally, we show that the CC filter works also\nin the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) metric describing a black hole environment\nwith a CC compatible to the future de Sitter cosmos.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe starting point of this work is a CC or equivalently a vacuum energy density \u039b of\nenormous magnitude. This expectation is suggested by contributions to the CC coming\nfrom phase transitions in the early universe, zero-point energy in quantum field theory\nor even from quantum gravity. In general, all these parts are of different magnitude and\nprobably unrelated to each other. Hence, the sum \u039b of all terms is dominated by the\nlargest contribution. Since other energy sources dilute with the expansion of the universe,\nthe CC will eventually take control over the cosmos. Depending on its sign the CC would\ninduce in the very early universe either a Big Crunch or an eternal de Sitter phase with\na very high Hubble rate H \u221d \u039b. Obviously, the standard Big Bang evolution does not\nhappen in this case.\nThe simplest way to avoid this problem is the introduction of a CC counterterm \u039bct ,\nwhich makes the sum |\u039b + \u039bct | smaller than the currently observed critical energy dens4 were related to the\nity \u03c1c0 \u223c 10\u221247 GeV4 . For concreteness let us assume that \u039b \u223c \u2212Mew\n2\nelectroweak phase transition at the energy scale Mew \u223c 10 GeV. Then the counterterm\nmust be extraordinarily close to (\u2212\u039b) requiring an enormous amount of fine-tuning,\n1+\n\n\u039bct\n\u03c1c0\n<\n\u223c 10\u221255 .\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\n(1)\n\nApart from the fine-tuning of the classical counterterm, the situation is even more involved\nwhen quantum corrections are included, cf. Ref. [1] for an elaborated discussion in the\n1\n\n\fcontext of the electroweak sector of the standard model of particles. Moreover, the problem\nworsens when \u039b is dominated by higher energy scales, possibly originating from grand\nunified theories where \u039b \u223c (1016 GeV)4 or quantum gravity with \u039b \u223c (1019 GeV)4 for\ninstance. Summing up, the fine-tuning of the CC is considered to be one of the most severe\nproblems in theoretical physics [2, 3]. In addition, the current accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse [4, 5, 6] can be explained very well by a tiny CC of the same magnitude as the\nenergy density of matter, giving rise to the so-called coincidence problem. For the latter\nproblem many explanations have been proposed [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], which induce late-time\naccelerated expansion. However, most of these models tacitly assume that the large \u039b has\nbeen fine-tuned away and thus they do not address the big CC problem.\nWithout fine-tuning we have to accept the existence of the presumed huge CC, and\nwe have to find a way to neutralise its effects in order to obtain a reasonable cosmological\nevolution. Along this line, several proposals have been made, e.g. relaxation models for a\nlarge CC in the context of matter with an inhomogeneous equation of state (EOS) [12],\nor in the LXCDM framework [13] with a variable cosmological term [14, 15], see also [16,\n17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Removing or filtering out vacuum energy has been investigated e.g. in\nRefs. [22, 23, 24, 25], and it is a feature in unimodular gravity [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Recently,\na CC relaxation model has been discussed in the context of modified gravity with an action\nfunctional f (R, G) involving the Ricci scalar R and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant G in the\nmetric formalism [31, 1], where the action is varied with respect to the metric gab only.\nIn this work, we also consider a modified gravity model with an action functional f\nin terms of the Ricci scalar R and the squared Ricci tensor Q = Rab Rab . However, here\nwe apply the Palatini formalism, where the metric gab and the connection \u0393abc are treated\nindependently by the variation principle. In contrast, the metric formalism requires from\nthe beginning that\n1\n\u0393abc [g] = g ad (gdc,b + gbd,c \u2212 gbc,d )\n(2)\n2\nis the Levi-Civita connection of gab , whereas the Palatini connection depends also on the\nmatter sector. As we will show in this paper, this allows the construction of a filter for\na large CC, and the results will be similar in effect to unimodular gravity. However, in\nour setup the CC is not eliminated completely, but it appears in suppressed corrections.\nFurthermore, we investigate the filter effect from the early universe till the asymptotic\nfuture in addition to black hole environments. It turns out that finite vacuum energy\nshifts originating e.g. from phase transitions can be neutralised, too.\nThere is an interesting conceptual difference to the CC relaxation models in the metric\nformalism, where the large vacuum energy is not filtered out from the total energy content,\nbut gravity is modified such that \u039b does not induce large curvatures. This happens on the\nlevel of the Einstein equations, i.e. by solving differential equations to obtain concrete lowcurvature solutions. In the Palatini framework of this paper, we will show that the large CC\ncan be removed already in an algebraic way before solving differential equations. Moreover,\nthe latter are only of second order, whereas the metric version of modified gravity generally\ninvolves a higher differential order, signalling the existence of new degrees of freedom, which\ncan be the source of new instabilities and other problems. More differences between both\nformalisms will become visible in the forthcoming discussions in this paper.\nSome work on the Palatini formalism can be found e.g. in Refs. [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37],\nand comparisons with the metric and other formalisms were made in Refs. [38, 39, 40, 41,\n42, 43, 44]. Non-trivial properties in Palatini models have been investigated in Refs. [45,\n46, 47, 48], and finally the resolution of the Big Bang singularity has been proposed in this\n\n2\n\n\fcontext [49, 50], possibly in connection with loop quantum gravity [51].\nThe paper is organised as follows, in Sec. 2 we briefly reproduce how to solve f (R, Q)\nmodified gravity models. In Sec. 3 we present our model which filters out the large CC.\nThe results will be applied to cosmology in Sec. 4 discussing the radiation, matter and\nlate-time de Sitter era. Finally, in Sec. 5 we show that the CC filter works also for the\nKottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) solution describing a black hole in the presence of a CC.\nWe conclude in Sec. 6 and give an outlook to future developments.\nIn this work the speed of light c and the Planck constant ~ are set to unity, the signature\nof the metric is (\u22121, +1, +1, +1).\n\n2\n\nf (R, Q) modified gravity in the Palatini formalism\n\nThe action of our setup is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u02c6\np 1\n4\nS= d x\n|g| f (R, Q) + Smat [gab, \u03c6],\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere gab is the \"physical\" metric, on which the matter fields \u03c6 in Smat propagate. The Ricci\nscalar R and the squared Ricci tensor Q depend on both the metric and the connection \u0393abc\nwhile the Ricci tensor Rab is defined only in terms of the latter:\nRab [\u0393] = \u0393eab,e \u2212 \u0393eeb,a + \u0393eab \u0393ff e \u2212 \u0393eaf \u0393feb\n\n(4)\n\nR[g, \u0393] = Raa = g ab Rab\n\n(5)\n\nab\n\nac bd\n\nQ[g, \u0393] = R Rab = g g Rab Rcd .\n\n(6)\n\nNote that in general these quantities are different from their metric versions, and the\nabsence of torsion implies that the connection is symmetric. Moreover, we restrict our\ndiscussion to the case of a symmetric Ricci tensor Rab in the action (3). This property is\nnot automatic even for symmetric connections, which was shown recently in Ref. [52].\nWith these preliminaries the variation 2 \u03b4S/\u03b4g ab = 0 of the action functional S with\nrespect to gab yields the modified Einstein equations\n1\nfR Rmn + 2fQ Rma Ran \u2212 \u03b4mn f = Tmn ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the energy-momentum tensor Tmn emerges from the term Smat , and fR and fQ are\npartial derivatives of f with respect to the scalars R and Q. Moreover, we obtain from\n\u03b4S/\u03b4\u0393abc = 0 the equation of motion (EOM) for the Palatini connection,\nhp\ni\n\u2207a\n|g|(fR g mn + 2fQ Rmn ) = 0,\n(8)\nwhere \u2207a denotes the covariant derivative in terms of the yet unknown connection \u0393abc .\nAt this point we should remark that in the metric formalism the term Q yields EOMs\nwith higher-order derivatives and problematic extra degrees of freedom. Generally, it is\ndifficult to avoid instabilities, e.g. of the Ostrogradski-type1 [53]. In contrast, the Palatini\n1\nIn the metric approach this type of instability can be avoided in gravity actions depending only on\nthe Ricci scalar R and the Gauss-Bonnet term G. It would be interesting to compare both approaches in\nthe context of f (R, G) models. However, G contains the squared Riemann tensor, and to our knowledge\nno method to solve the corresponding Palatini EOMs has been found yet.\n\n3\n\n\fformalism provides second-order EOMs for our scenario just as standard general relativity,\nand problems from extra degrees of freedom do not occur.\nIn the following, we work along the lines of Ref. [49], where a procedure for solving the\nPalatini EOMs is discussed. The strategy is as follows: the formal solutions to both EOMs\nin (7) and (8) relate in an algebraic way the geometrical scalars R and Q with the physical\nmetric gab and the energy-momentum tensor Tmn , respectively. Thus, one can express R\nand Q in terms of the matter content alone by solving this set of equations. Subsequently,\nthe results are plugged back into the formal solutions to obtain the explicit form of the\nPalatini connection \u0393 and all the quantities derived from it. Since the results will involve\nthe metric gab and its derivatives, it is possible to relate the cosmic expansion rate with the\nmatter energy density, for instance. In the rest of this section, we explain the procedure\nfor general f (R, Q) models.\nFirst, let us write Eq. (7) in matrix form by introducing the 4 \u00d7 4-matrices P\u0302 = Rmn =\nRma g an and T\u0302 = Tmn , whose entries are just the components of the corresponding tensors\ncomponents. With the identity matrix I\u02c6 we obtain\n1\nfR P\u0302 + 2fQ (P\u0302 )2 \u2212 f I\u02c6 = T\u0302 ,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nand the trace of this equation reads\nfR R + 2QfQ \u2212 2f = T,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere R = tr(P\u0302 ), Q = tr(P\u0302 2 ) and T = Tmm .\nFor determining the Palatini connection \u0393 we introduce the auxiliary metric hmn and\nconsider the equation\ni\nhp\n(11)\n\u2207a [\u0393]\n|h|hmn = 0,\nwhere \u2207a [\u0393] is the covariant derivative in terms of \u0393. Consequently, in order to solve this\nequation the connection \u0393 must be compatible with hmn , i.e. it has to be the Levi-Civita\nconnection of hmn ,\n1\n\u0393abc [h] = had (hdc,b + hbd,c \u2212 hbc,d ),\n(12)\n2\njust as in general relativity. Hence, we convert Eq. (8) into (11) by defining hmn in the\nfollowing way,\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\np\n|h|\u0125\u22121 = |g|\u011d \u22121 \u03a3\u0302 with \u03a3\u0302 = fR I\u02c6 + 2fQ P\u0302 ,\n(13)\nwhere the metric hmn (and analogously gmn ) has been written in matrix notation as \u0125 =\nhmn with its inverse \u0125\u22121 = hmn . Calculatingpthe determinant of both sides, we find\nh2 h\u22121 = h = g det \u03a3\u0302, which allows to eliminate |h| and finally yields\nmn\n\nh\n\n= \u0125\n\n\u22121\n\n\u011d \u22121 \u03a3\u0302\n=q\n, hmn = \u0125 =\n|det \u03a3\u0302|\n\nq\n|det \u03a3\u0302| \u03a3\u0302\u22121 \u011d.\n\n(14)\n\nSince the connection in (12) solves Eq. (11), the formal solution of Eq. (8) is also given\nby \u0393abc [h] in (12) if hmn is defined as in (14).\nThe remaining step is to find P\u0302 which requires an explicit form for the energy-momentum\ntensor Tmn . Here, we assume that the matter sector can be described by a perfect fluid,\nTmn = (\u03c1 + p)um un + (p \u2212 \u039b)\u03b4mn ,\n4\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere \u03c1 and p are the energy density and pressure of (ordinary) matter, including e.g.\ndust and incoherent radiation. And um denotes the corresponding 4-velocity vector of the\nmatter field. \u039b represents the energy density corresponding to the cosmological constant,\nand it contains all vacuum energy contributions. Thus we require p 6= \u2212\u03c1 without loss of\ngenerality. Next, let us write the matrix expression (9) in the following way\n(2fQ )2 M\u0302 2\nM\u0302\n\nn\n\\\nx2 I\u02c6 + \u03bc u\nmu\n1 fR \u02c6\n:= P\u0302 +\nI\n4 fQ\n\n=\n\n1\nx2 := 2fQ (p \u2212 \u039b) + fQ f + fR2\n4\n\u03bc := 2fQ (\u03c1 + p).\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n\nBy explicit calculation one can check that\nn\n\\\nca * 2fQ M\u0302 = x I\u02c6 + y u\nmu\n\nwith\ny :=\n\n\u2212x + cb *\n\np\nx2 + \u03bc(um um )\n(um um )\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\n2\nis a solution\n\u221a to Eq. (16), which yields P\u0302 . The constants ca,b = \u00b11 and the sign convention\nfor x = x2 will be fixed later by consistency considerations.\nNow, we have to determine the scalars R and Q, which follow from the trace equation (10) and the trace of (20),\n\nca (2fQ R + 2fR ) = 4x \u2212 y,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere um um = \u22121 will be used from here on. In the last equation we eliminate all roots\nby squaring twice, which results to\n\u0010\n\n(2fQ R + 2fR )2 + 8x2 + \u03bc\n\n\u00112\n\n= 36x2 (2fQ R + 2fR )2 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere ca,b = \u00b11 and odd powers of x have dropped out. Solving this algebraic equation\ntogether with (10) is the tough part of the Palatini formalism. Once this task is achieved,\nR, Q and P\u0302 = Rmn in (20) are given as functions of \u03c1, p, \u039b only, and can be used to calculate\nthe connection \u0393. For this purpose, let us write the matrix \u03a3\u0302 in (13) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u02c6\nL2\nn\nn\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\\\n\\\n\u03a3\u0302 = 2fQ M\u0302 + fR I = L1 I + L2 um u = L1 I +\num u ,\n(24)\n2\nL1\n1\nwith L1 := ca x + fR ,\nL2 := ca y.\n(25)\n2\nm\n3\nn\nUsing det(I\u02c6 + a[\nm b ) = 1 + b am we find det(\u03a3\u0302) = L1 (L1 \u2212 L2 ), and the inverse matrix\nreads\n1 \u02c6\nL2\nn\n\\\n\u03a3\u0302\u22121 =\nI\u2212\nu\nmu .\nL1\nL1 (L1 \u2212 L2 )\n2\n\nChanging the sign of x in Eqs. (20) and (21) by x \u2192 \u2212x\np corresponds to ca \u2192\np \u2212ca , and therefore it\n2 + \u03bc(u um ) = x\ndoes not yield a new solution.\nHere,\nwe\nuse\nthe\nconvention\nx\n1 + \u03bc(um um )/x2 , and\nm\n\u221a\nthe second possibility \u2212x 1 + * * * would just mean cb \u2192 \u2212cb .\n\n5\n\n\fFinally, we have all ingredients to write down the explicit form of the auxiliary metric3\nfrom Eq. (14)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nL2\n(26)\num un\nhmn = \u03a9 gmn \u2212\nL1 \u2212 L2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL2 m n\n(27)\nhmn = \u03a9\u22121 g mn +\nu u ,\nL1\nwhere\n\nq\n\u03a9 :=\n\n|det\u03a3\u0302|\nL1\n\np\n|L31 (L1 \u2212 L2 )|\n=\n.\nL1\n\n(28)\n\nOnce hmn is known, the connection \u0393abc follows directly from Eq. (12), and subsequently\nthe Ricci tensor (4) and the scalars in Eqs. (5) and (6) can be calculated.\n\n3\n\nRelaxing the CC with a filter\n\nIn this section we study a modified gravity model to relax the CC in the Palatini f (R, Q)\nframework. Motivated by earlier work in the metric formalism [31, 1] we consider the\nfollowing ansatz for the gravity action\nf (R, Q) = \u03baR + z with z := \u03b2\n\nRn\n, B = R2 \u2212 Q,\nBm\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03ba and \u03b2 are non-zero constant parameters and n and m positive numbers. In the\nmetric formalism model [31] the structure of the function B was enforcing the universe\nto expand like a matter dominated cosmos even when the matter energy density \u03c1m was\nmuch smaller in magnitude than the vacuum energy density \u039b. However, in the Palatini\nframework the function B is not known in the beginning, and it is necessary to investigate\nunder which circumstances a relaxed cosmological expansion behaviour can be obtained.\nMoreover, we will see in the following that z is not a correction to the Einstein-Hilbert\nterm but a crucial part of the action functional f . Therefore, one should refrain from\nconsidering the limit z \u2192 0.\nFrom Eq. (29) we find\nfR =\n\n\u03baR + nz\nz\n\u2212 2fQ R, fQ = m ,\nR\nB\n\n(30)\n\nand the trace of the stress tensor (15) reads\nT = \u22124\u039b + 3p \u2212 \u03c1.\n\n(31)\n\nAs a result, Eq. (10) provides the first equation for finding R and B (or Q),\n\u03b3z = \u03baR \u2212 4\u039b + 3p \u2212 \u03c1,\n\n\u03b3 := (n \u2212 2 \u2212 2m),\n\n(32)\n\nwhile the second one is given in Eq. (23), explicitly\n0\n\n=\n\n3 2\n2\nfQ\nR S3 + fQ\nS2 + fQ R\u22122 S1\n\n(33)\n\n3\nThe relation in Eq. (26) is called a disformal transformation [54], which is used e.g. in MOND theories [55] and scalar field models for dark energy [56].\n\n6\n\n\f\u0014\n\nS2\n\n\u0015\n1\n:= 72 \u03baR + \u03c1 + p + z(2 + 2n + \u03b3)\n3\n\u0002 2\n\u0001\n2\n:= 4 z \u221217n + 4n(2 + \u03b3) + 4(2 + \u03b3)2\n\nS1\n\n12z(\u03c1 + p)(2 \u2212 n + \u03b3) + 6z\u03baR(4 \u2212 5n + 2\u03b3)\n\u0003\n+ 9(\u03c1 + p)2 \u2212 9(\u03baR)2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n:= 24 z(\u03baR + nz)2 (n \u2212 2 \u2212 \u03b3) .\n\nS3\n\n(34)\n\n+\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\nApparently, this set of equations is quite complicated, thus we will solve it approximately.\nFirst, we consider in this work only the epochs when the large CC \u039b dominates over all\nother energy sources. Then Eq. (32) implies the relation z = \u03b2Rn /B m = O(\u039b) suggesting\n\u22121\nthat B/R2 and fQ\n= B/(mz) are relatively small quantities, which may be used as expansion parameters in Eq. (33). At this point we cannot prove this suggestion quantitatively\nbecause R and B are not known yet. However, it will be confirmed later by Eqs. (43)\n\u22121\nand (45). As a result of assuming that fQ\nis sufficiently small, the term S3 proportional\n3\nto fQ in (33) will be the most important one, and a good zero-order solution can be found\n2 S + f R\u22122 S and solving only S = 0.\nby neglecting the other terms fQ\n2\n1\n3\nQ\nOur goal is a relaxed universe, i.e. one which is not dominated by the large CC term,\nand it can be realised by requiring that the Ricci scalar R following from S3 = 0 is\nfree from large O(z) contributions. This happens when the parameter n is restricted by\n2 + 2n + \u03b3 = 3n \u2212 2m = 0, which eliminates the O(z) term in Eq. (34). We will apply this\ncondition from now on, hence Eq. (33) can be written as\n0 = \u03baR + r\n\u0012 \u0013\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\nB\n3\n9\n2\n2\n2\nmz\n1+\n(3\u03baR + 2r) +\n(\u03baR) \u2212 r\n\u2212\n9\nR2\nmz\n4(mz)2\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\nB\n3\u03baR 2\n8\n+\nmz\n1+\nwith r := \u03c1 + p.\n27\nR2\n2(mz)\n\n(37)\n\nFrom the first line in the last equation one clearly observes that CC terms with EOS p = \u2212\u03c1\ndo not contribute to the Ricci scalar at leading order. In other words, the CC is filtered\nout from r = \u03c1 + p, which describes the matter sector. Note that z = O(\u039b) still appears\nin suppressed correction terms.\nIn the following, we will solve Eq. (37) in situations relevant for cosmology. A first order\ncorrection to S3 = 0 can be found by keeping only the term z(B/R2 ) from the second line\nin (37), which leads to\n2\n\u03baR + r = mz\n9\n\n\u0012\n\nB\nR2\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n= mz\n9\n\n\u0012 \u00131\n\u03b2 m \u22124\nR 3,\nz\n\n(38)\n\nwhere we used z = \u03b2Rn /B m from Eq. (29) with 3n = 2m in the last step. Thus, we obtain\na 7th -order polynomial equation in R,\n\u0012 \u0013 1 !3\n2\n\u03b2 m\n3\n4\n4\n(\u03baR + r) (\u03baR) = L3 := \u03ba\nmz\n,\n(39)\n9\nz\nwhich clearly shows that R is a function of \u03c1 and p only. Finally, we find the approximate\nsolution\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012 \u00131\nD\nL3 3\n\u03baR = \u2212r + D + O\nwith D :=\n,\n(40)\nr\nr4\n7\n\n\fwhen the matter-related quantity r lies in the range |D| \u001c r \u001c |\u039b|, which we refer to as\nthe early-time limit or the limit of large energy density in r. Moreover, \u03baR < 0 because\nr > 0 for ordinary matter, and \u03baR will remain negative for decreasing \u03c1 because \u03baR \u2192 0\nis not a solution of Eq. (39).\nIn the opposite limit, r \u2192 0, which is called the late-time limit in the following, we\nobtain from Eq. (39)\n\u0012 2\u0013\n1\n3\nr\n\u03baR = \u03c1e \u2212 r + O\nwith \u03c1e := L37 ,\n(41)\n7\n\u03c1e\nindicating that \u03baR approaches the negative constant \u03c1e for vanishing matter. For a given\nvalue of \u039b or z the parameter \u03b2 must be chosen adequately for L3 = \u03c17e < 0. In Sec. 4.2 we\nwill show that (\u2212\u03c1e ) is close to the critical energy density in the asymptotic future, which\ncorresponds to the tiny observed value of the effective CC in Eq. (83). The parameter\ndependence of the solution set of the full equation (37) might further constrain \u03b2, however\nthis has to be determined numerically. In Fig. 1 we show an example for m = 3 and \u03c1e < 0,\nwhich nicely demonstrates the validity of our approximations. Note that not all values of m\nmight allow physically reasonable solutions. We will discuss some examples for \u03b2 at the end\nof Sec. 4.2. However, in this work we concentrate on analytical results, and the complete\nparameter dependence as well as the case L3 > 0 will be investigated elsewhere.\nVia z = \u03b2(R2/3 /B)m from Eq. (29) it is straightforward to obtain B and B/R2 from the\napproximate solution of R. In the following we denote subdominant corrections by \u03b5 \u001c 1.\nAccordingly, at early times Eq. (40) yields\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2D\nL3 2\n\u22122\n2\nB =\nmz\n(\u2212\u03ba)\n1\u2212\n+ O(\u03b5 ) ,\n(42)\nD 9\n3 r\n\u0013\n\u0012\nB\nD\nD\n\u0001 1\u2212\n=\n+ O(\u03b52 ) ,\n(43)\n2\n2\nR\nr\nmz\n9\nwhereas from Eq. (41) we obtain the corresponding late-time results\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 r\n2\nB =\n(\u2212\u03ba)\n1\u2212\n+ O(\u03b5 ) ,\n7 \u03c1e\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\nB\n2\n4 r\n2\n= \u03c1e\nmz\n1\u2212\n+ O(\u03b5 ) .\nR2\n9\n7 \u03c1e\n\u03c13e\n\n2\nmz\n9\n\n\u22122\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nThese results confirm that B/R2 is sufficiently small to justify that we neglected some\nterms in Eq. (37), hence, we have found consistent solutions for R and B. More support\nfor the validity of the approximations is provided by the numerical solution of the complete\nEq. (37) in Fig. 1.\nWith R and B as functions of only the matter-related term r, it is possible to calculate L1,2 in (25). First, we have to define the square root of x2 in (20). Since we work\nin the limit |R2 /B| \u001d 1, which implies |fQ R| = |mzR/B| \u001d z/R, we identify fQ R to be\n1 2\n2\n2\nthe dominant term in Eqs. (30) and (18).\n\u221a Thus fR \u2248 \u22122fQ R and x \u2248 4 fR \u2248 (fQ R) ,\nand we choose the convention x = fQ R 1 + * * *, where * * * denotes the remaining terms in\nEq. (18) divided by (fQ R)2 . Next, we plug x \u2248 \u2212 12 fR \u2248 fQ R into the trace equation (22)\nca (2fQ R + 2fR ) = 3x + cb * x\n\n8\n\nq\n1 \u2212 (2fQ r)x\u22122 ,\n\n(46)\n\n\f8\n7\nexact result\nearly time\nlate time\n\n6\n5\n\u03baR/\u03c1e 4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n-r/\u03c1e\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 1: Numerical solutions for \u03baR < 0 as a function of r = \u03c1 with p = 0. The plot\nshows the exact result in Eq. (37) (black solid curve) and the approximations at early times\n(red dashed) from Eq. (40) as well as at late times (blue dashed-dotted) from Eq. (41),\nrespectively. In this example with m = 3 the parameter \u03b2 < 0 has been chosen such that\n\u2212|\u039b| \u2248 358 \u03c1e only for numerical reasons. A more realistic ratio of |\u039b/\u03c1e | would be much\nlarger, however the results would not differ qualitatively, which is true also for other values\nof the EOS p/\u03c1 as long as r \u001c |\u039b|. In any case, \u03baR approaches \u2212r (dotted diagonal line)\nin the region \u2212\u03c1e \u001c r \u001c |\u039b|.\n\n9\n\n\fwhich gives in leading order ca (\u22122)fQ R = fQ R(3 + cb ).

Now, we have all ingredients available for\ndiscussing solutions to the Palatini field equations in the next sections.\n\n4\n\nCosmology\n\nFor investigating the cosmological evolution the physical metric is of the spatially flat\nFriedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) type with g00 = \u22121 and gii = a2 (t) in\nCartesian coordinates, where a(t) is the scale factor as a function of cosmological time t.\nThe matter component is at rest (um = \u2212\u03b40m ) in these coordinates. Accordingly, the\nauxiliary metric hab in Eq. (26) is completely defined by the diagonal elements hii = \u03a9gii\nand h00 = \u03a9(g00 \u2212 L2 /(L1 \u2212 L2 )), which follow explicitly from Eqs. (47), (48) and (52),\nr\np\n\u0001\n|L1 (L1 \u2212 L2 )|\n2\n\u03a9 =\n= sgn(L1 ) | (mz)2 B \u22121 | 1 + \u03b52 ,\n(53)\nL1\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nB\n\u2212L1\nR2\nh00 = \u03a9\n= \u03a9 \u22126\n1 \u2212 2 (1 + \u03b5) .\n(54)\nL1 \u2212 L2\nB\nR\n4\nNote that our scenario with cb = \u22121 relies from the very beginning on the existence of matter, because\notherwise the vector um in Eq. (16) were absent and cb = +1 would be required in Eq. (21). However,\nmatter is a fact of reality, which singles out cb = \u22121 in our model. Consequently, Eq. (41) is the correct\nsolution in the r \u2192 0 limit.\n\n10\n\n\fNote that if B and L1 are positive, the metric hab has the same signature as gab . Moreover,\nin the following z will be treated as a time-independent constant proportional to the CC \u039b\nsince the corrections can be subsumed in the \u03b5 \u223c O(\u03baR/z) terms. At this point we are\nready to apply the results for B and R2 /B that we found in Eqs. (42), (43), (44) and (45),\nrespectively.\n\n4.1\n\nEarly universe\n\nWe begin with the epoch, where the matter energy density \u03c1 (including dust and radiation)\nis well below the large CC \u039b \u223c z in magnitude but above the asymptotic future energy\ndensity |\u03c1e |. Therefore, our discussion will be valid for most parts of the radiation and\nmatter eras. According to (53) and (54) we find\n\u0012 \u00131 \u0012\n\u0013\nD 4\nD\n2\n\u03a9 = c1\n1 + e e1 + O(e ) , c1 = const.\n(55)\nL3\n3r\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n4\nD\n\u2212 14 \u2212 3\n2\nh00 = c1 \u2212 mz/e L3 D 4 1 \u2212 e e2 + O(e ) ,\n(56)\n3\nr\nwhere r = \u03c1 + p and D = (L3q\n/r4 )(1/3) was introduced earlier in Eq. (40). The sign under\n\nthe root in the constant c1 = \u00b13( 92 mz)3 (\u2212\u03ba)2 may be chosen such that consistency with\nEq. (53) is obtained. However, since c1 drops out from the connection \u0393(h) in Eq. (12)\nwe skip this question for the moment. In addition, we have introduced above the purely\ntechnical parameter e = 1 which counts the powers of the small quantity |D| \u001c r, whereas\ne1,2 = 1 just denote first-order correction terms.\nAccording to Eq. (12) the non-zero components of the (symmetric) connection read\n(with i = 1, 2, 3)\n1 \u1e59\n7 \u1e59 D\n+ e e2\n+ O(e2 ),\n2r\n6\nr\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\na2\n\u0227 \u1e59\nD 6 \u2212\n+ O(e2 ),\n= e\n8mz\na r\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0227 \u1e59\n7 \u1e59 D\n1\n=\n6 \u2212\n\u2212 e e1\n+ O(e2 ).\n6\na r\n18 r r\n\n\u0393000 =\n\n(57)\n\n\u03930ii\n\n(58)\n\n\u0393ii0\n\n(59)\n\nFor a simpler presentation we assume from now on a constant matter EOS \u03c9 = p/\u03c1 >\n\u22121, which yields a simple expansion law for our matter component via its conservation\nequation5\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3 \u03c1(1 + \u03c9) = 0 \u21d4 \u03c1 \u221d a\u22123(1+\u03c9) .\n(60)\na\nHence, from Eq.

Due to Ri = O(e)\nthe leading component of the Ricci scalar R = R0 + 3Ri is just the O(e0 )-term in R0 :\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\n3\n\u0227\n\u00e4\nR = (\u03c9 + 3) 2(\u03c9 + 1)\n+ O(e).\n(63)\n+\n2\na\na\nComparing this result with \u03baR = \u2212\u03c1(1 + \u03c9) + O(e) from Eq. (40), we quickly deduce the\nleading scale factor behaviour. The situation is similar to general relativity because the\npower-law ansatz a(t) \u221d ts , s = const. for the scale factor represents a reasonable solution.\nEquipped with the corresponding Hubble rate H = s/t and \u00e4/a = s(s \u2212 1)/t2 , Eq. (63)\nyields R \u221d t\u22122 at zero order, and \u03c1 \u221d a\u22123(1+\u03c9) \u221d t\u22123s(1+\u03c9) will be proportional to R if\ns=\n\n2\nin a(t) \u221d ts .\n3(\u03c9 + 1)\n\n(64)\n\nHence, we find from Eq. (63)\nH=\n\n2\n\u00e4\n1 + 3\u03c9\n3\n,\n= H2\n, R = (\u03c9 + 3)2 H 2 + O(e) = (\u2212\u03ba)\u22121 \u03c1(1 + \u03c9),\n3(\u03c9 + 1)t a\n2\n4\n\n(65)\n\nimplying the modified Friedmann equation\n(\u2212\u03ba)H 2 =\n\n4 \u03c9+1\n\u03c1,\n3 (\u03c9 + 3)2\n\n(66)\n\nwhich is the main result of this section. Accordingly, a dust dominated universe with\nEOS \u03c9 = 0 leads to\n4\n(\u2212\u03ba)H 2 = \u03c1, (dust)\n(67)\n27\nwhich is not very different from the radiation dominated cosmos with \u03c9 = 31 . In the latter\ncase, the modified Friedmann equation reads\n(\u2212\u03ba)H 2 =\n\n4\n\u03c1,\n25\n\n(radiation)\n\n(68)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the radiation energy density. Obviously, dust matter and radiation influence\nthe cosmic expansion in almost the same way as in standard general relativity if we choose\n4\nthe parameter \u03ba = \u2212 27\n* 3/(8\u03c0GN ) with Newton's constant GN . However, comparing\nEq. (67) with (68) indicates an increased expansion rate in the radiation era, which can\nbe expressed by a higher effective Newton constant Grad = 27\n25 GN = 1, 08 GN . This 8%\ndifference seems to be well within current bounds on the variation of GN . For instance,\nin the context of Big Bang nucleosynthesis the bound Grad /GN = 1, 10 \u00b1 0, 07 was given\nrecently in Ref. [57], which can be related also to constraints on (additional) relativistic\ndegrees of freedom [58, 59, 60]. Accordingly, the small difference in the expansion rates\nabove is not in conflict with recent observations.\nAs a more technical point we remark that \u03ba = +1/(8\u03c0GN ) is positive in general relativity, however, in our setup the negative term \u03baR < 0 is only one part in the action (29),\n12\n\n\fwhich is completed by the crucial term z. Consequently, \u03ba < 0 does not correspond to\na negative Newton constant in general relativity. Another interesting feature of Eq. (66)\nis that even if we had allowed additional vacuum energy (\u03c9 = \u22121) contributions in \u03c1,\nit would not influence the expansion rate H because of the vanishing right-hand side of\nEq. (66). An example for this are finite shifts |\u03b4\u039b| \u001c |\u039b| in the vacuum energy density\nemerging from phase transitions.\nComparing the Palatini setup with the CC relaxation models in the LXCDM framework [14, 15] and in metric f (R, G) [31, 1] modified gravity, we find another advantage.\nHere, it is not necessary to include a parameter which controls the transition from radiation\nto (dust) matter domination. It simply happens when the energy density \u03c1dust \u221d a\u22123 of\ndust matter overtakes the radiation density \u03c1radiation \u221d a\u22124 as a result of the growing scale\nfactor a. Therefore, the relation of the energy content with the expansion of the universe\nis very similar to general relativity with a negligible CC.\nFor completeness we list all results including a first order correction in the scale factor\n\u0012\na(t) =\n\nt\nt0\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n3(\u03c9+1)\n\n\u0012\n1 + ea e\n\nD\n\u03c1(1 + \u03c9)\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(69)\n\nwith the constant ea to be determined below. The components of the diagonal Ricci tensor\nread\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\n(\u03c9 + 3)2\nD 7[4e1 (5 + 4\u03c9) + 3(3 + \u03c9)(e2 + ea (23 + 19\u03c9))]\n2\nR0 =\n1+e\n+ O(e ) ,\n3t2 (1 + \u03c9)2\n\u03c1\n3(3 + \u03c9)2\nD(\u03c9 + 3)2\nRi = e\n+ O(e2 ),\n(70)\n4mzt2 (1 + \u03c9)2\nyielding the Ricci scalar R = R0 + 3Ri and the squared Ricci tensor Q,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u03c9 + 3)2\n9 D\n2\nR = R0 + 2\n1+e\n+ O(e )\n3t (1 + \u03c9)2\n4 mz\nQ = Rab Rba = (R0 )2 + 3(Ri )2 = (R0 )2 + O(e2 ).\n\n(71)\n(72)\n\nThus, the function B in the denominator of z in Eq. (29) is given by\nB = R2 \u2212 Q = 6R * Ri \u2212 12(Ri )2 = e\n\nD(3 + \u03c9)4\n+ O(e2 ),\nmz(2t4 )(1 + \u03c9)4\n\n(73)\n\nwhich evidently proves that B/R2 = O(D/z) is a small quantity justifying a posteriori\nour series expansions. In addition, since B is relatively small but finite, the term z in the\naction (29) does not diverge.\nFinally, let us determine the coefficient ea in the scale factor correction term by com817\n10\nparing R in (71) with Eq. (40), yielding ea = \u2212 63\nfor dust (\u03c9 = 0) and ea = \u2212 6160\nfor\n1\n9 D\nradiation (\u03c9 = 3 ), respectively. Note that the term e 4 mz in R does not come from the\nfirst-order corrections \u221d e1,2,a in Eqs. (55) and (56), but it emerges as the leading term\nof Ri and it provides the correct (non-zero) value for B. With these results one can check\nexplicitely that z = \u03b2(R(2/3) /B)m and the validity of the EOMs in Eqs. (7) and (8).\n\n4.2\n\nLate universe\n\nAnalogously to the discussion on the early universe in the previous section, we determine\nnow the scale factor evolution at late times, when r = \u03c1 + p \u001c |\u03c1e | and \u03c1e < 0. After\n13\n\n\fplugging B and B/R2 from Eqs. (44) and (45) into the expressions (53) and (54) for the\nauxiliary metric hab , we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 r\n\u2212 32\n2\n1 + e e1\n\u03a9 = c2 \u03c1e\n+ O(e ) ,\n(74)\n7 \u03c1e\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 5\u0012\n4\n3 r\n\u22122\n2\n+ O(e ) .\n(75)\n1 \u2212 e e2\nh00 = c2 \u2212 mz/e \u03c1e\n3\n7 \u03c1e\nq\n2\n3\n2\nAlso here, the minus sign in \u03c1e should be absorbed in the constant c2 = \u00b1 27\n2 ( 9 mz) (\u2212\u03ba) ,\nwhich drops out when calculating the connection \u0393(h) in (12). Like before e = 1 represents\npowers of suppressed terms like B/R2 = O(\u03c1e /z) or r/\u03c1e , and e1,2 = 1 signal first-order\ncorrections. The non-vanishing components of the connection are given by (with i = 1, 2, 3)\n3 \u1e59\n+ O(e2 ),\n14 \u03c1e\n3a2 \u0227\n= e\n\u03c1e + O(e2 ),\n4mz a\n1 \u1e59\n\u0227\n+ e e1\n+ O(e2 ).\n=\na\n14 \u03c1e\n\n\u0393000 = \u2212e e2\n\n(76)\n\n\u03930ii\n\n(77)\n\n\u0393ii0\n\n(78)\n\nFurthermore, we assume a constant EOS \u03c9 for the matter content as in Eq. (60), which\nsimplifies the expressions for the Ricci tensor components R0 = R00 and Ri = R11 from\nEq. (4),\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\n9\nr\n\u00e4\n\u00e4\n\u0227\n\u2212 e1\nR0 = 3 + e (1 + \u03c9)\n(e1 (2 + 3\u03c9) \u2212 3e2 )\n+ O(e2 ),\na\n14\n\u03c1e\na\na\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u00e4\n\u0227\n3\u03c1e\n+\n2\n+ O(e2 ).\n(79)\nRi = e\n4mz\na\na\nAs before, the scale factor behaviour can be found by comparing the zero-order term in\nthe Ricci scalar R = R0 + 3Ri = 3 a\u00e4 + O(e) with Eq. (41) in the limit r \u2192 0,\n\u03ba3\n\n\u00e4\n= \u03c1e .\na\n\n(80)\n\nThe solution is a linear combination of exponential functions, a(t) \u221d exp(\u00b1He t) with\nconstant He . Since the shrinking solution quickly decays at late times we drop it and\nconsider only the de Sitter-like solution\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr\na(t) \u221d exp(He t) 1 + e ea\n,\n(81)\n\u03c1e\nwhere a first-order correction proportional to the constant ea has been added.

Neglecting the tiny O(\u03c1e /z)-term in Ri , the Ricci scalar R =\nR0 + 3Ri will be consistent with Eq. (41), \u03baR = \u03c1e \u2212 37 r, if\n\u03c1e = 3\u03baHe2 and ea =\n\n\u2212\u03c9\n.\n14(1 + \u03c9)\n\n(83)\n\nFrom the first condition the parameter \u03b2 in L3 = \u03c17e < 0 can be determined because \u2212\u03ba \u223c\n1/GN was suggested in Sec. 4.1 and thus \u2212\u03c1e \u223c \u2212\u03baHe2 must be of the order of the latetime critical energy density. This is just the effective CC corresponding to the de Sitter\nsolution (81) with the tiny observed Hubble rate He . For dust matter (\u03c9 = 0) the scale\nfactor correction \u221d ea vanishes and the expansion is purely de Sitter-like.\nAs in the previous section, the squared Ricci tensor reads Q = (R0 )2 + O(e2 ) and we\nfind that the denominator of z in Eq. (29) is highly suppressed but non-zero,\nB = R2 \u2212 Q = 6R * Ri \u2212 12(Ri )2 = e\n\n81He4 \u03c1e\n+ O(e2 ).\n2mz\n\n(84)\n\nTherefore, our expansion in B/R2 = O(\u03c1e /z) turns out to be justified also at late times.\nTo finalise this section we estimate the magnitude of the parameter \u03b2 expressed as a\npower of an energy scale M\u03b2 . The dimensional analysis of z in Eq. (29) implies |\u03b2| = M\u03b2d\nwith the exponent given by d = 4 + 38 m. From Eq. (32) we know that z is of the order of\nthe large cosmological term \u039b, and in Eq. (83) we related (\u2212\u03c1e ) \u223c (10\u221212 GeV)4 to the tiny\nobserved energy density of the effective late-time CC. Finally, in Sec. 4.1 the parameter\n(\u2212\u03ba) \u223c (1018 GeV)2 was fixed by the inverse Newton constant, and now we are prepared\nto estimate \u03b2 for given values of \u039b and m by using \u03c17e = L3 in Eq. (39),\n\u0012\n\u03b2=\n\n\u03c17e\n\u03ba4\n\n\u0013 m3 \u0012\n\n9\n2m\n\n\u0013m\n\nz (1\u2212m) .\n\n(85)\n\nFirst, we note that with large values of m the tiny first factor in \u03b2 produces small values\nof M\u03b2 = |\u03b2|1/d , which makes this parameter range less attractive. On the other hand, m <\n1 provides an interesting range of energy scales. For instance, for the vacuum energy\ndensity |\u039b| \u223c |z| \u223c (1016 GeV)4 of a typical grand unified theory we obtain the following\nmagnitudes of M\u03b2 in units of GeV: 10\u221251 for m = 3, 10\u22122 (m = 13 ), 104 (m = 15 ), 1012\n1\n(m = 17\n), and M\u03b2 approaches z in the limit m \u2192 0. Apart from that, the structure of\nEq. (85) does not require \u03b2 to be fixed very precisely, which constitutes a much better\nsituation compared to the counterterm method in Eq. (1).\n\n5\n\nKottler solution\n\nIn the previous section we have seen that the universe approaches a de Sitter cosmos\nin the limit of vanishing matter, where r \u2192 0 and \u03baR \u2192 \u03c1e in Eq. (41). We use this\nresult now for discussing the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) solution, which describes a\nSchwarzschild black hole in the presence of a positive CC. For analysing the CC filter in\nthis environment we need the 4-velocity vector um from Eq. (26), which we know already in\nthe cosmological setup. Therefore, it is useful to apply a transformation from the spatially\nflat FLRW coordinates (t, \u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6) with line element\n\u0001\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t) d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03b82 + \u03c12 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n(86)\n\n15\n\n\finto Lema\u00eetre coordinates (\u03c4, \u03c3, \u03b8, \u03c6), where the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 remain untouched,\nds2 = \u2212A d\u03c4 2 + A\u22121 d\u03c3 2 + \u03c3 2 d\u03b82 + \u03c3 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\n\n(87)\n\nIn the latter metric the mass of the black hole in terms of the Schwarzschild radius rs and\nrespectively the de Sitter radius re define the term\nA(\u03c3) = 1 \u2212\n\nrs \u03c3 2\n\u2212 2.\n\u03c3\nre\n\n(88)\n\nThe radial coordinates are related by \u03c3 = a(t)\u03c1 and if we require that A = 1 \u2212 (H\u03c3)2 with\nthe Hubble rate H = \u0227a , the transformation rules between both metrics in (86) and (87)\nread\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c4\n1 \u2202\u03c4\naH\u03c3\na 1\u2212A\n= H\u03c3 = 1 \u2212 A,\n= a,\n= ,\n=\n=\n.\n(89)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t\nA \u2202\u03c1\nA\nA\nNext, we consider the 4-velocity vector um in (26), which has only one non-vanishing component ut = 1 in FLRW coordinates.

Remember\nthat He originates from the small effective vacuum energy density of the order |\u03c1e | and\nnot from the large CC \u039b. Note also that Eqs. (90) and (98) are sufficient to show that\nthe metric (87) with A given in (88) is a solution of our Palatini model. The coordinate\ntransformation (89) just served us to obtain the vector um in Lema\u00eetre coordinates. As a\nresult of this section, the CC is relaxed also in situations, which can be well described by\nthe Kottler metric. This can be very useful for solar system tests and the construction of\nvacuole solutions of the Einstein-Strauss type [61, 62], which we would like to discuss in\nthe future. For the vacuole solutions we cannot assume r \u001c |\u03c1e | as we did in Sec. 4.2, but\nthe matter density r must be treated on equal footing with the effective vacuum energy\ndensity |\u03c1e |.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nIn the context of the old CC problem, we have presented a modified gravity model, which\nfilters out a large CC \u039b independent of its origin. Thanks to the Palatini formalism, we\navoid problems coming from extra degrees of freedom, which are often present in the metric\nformalism. In this work, several aspects of our filter scenario have been analysed with the\nresult that the standard Big Bang history of the universe is not prevented by a large CC\nterm even when it dominates in size over matter or radiation.\n\n17\n\n\fUnlike many models for cosmological late-time acceleration, our setup in Eq. (29) does\nnot represent a small correction to the Einstein-Hilbert term because the term z containing the Ricci scalar R and the squared Ricci tensor Q, plays a crucial role for the filter\neffect. Thus, it is neither useful nor necessary to consider the limit z \u2192 0. Furthermore, we have shown that the Hubble expansion rate in the early universe is dominated\nby the (non-vacuum) matter energy density, whereas CC contributions with equation of\nstate \u03c9 = \u22121 do not contribute at all in leading order. This filter effect implies a cosmological background evolution similar to general relativity, where the large CC has been\nremoved somehow. We have found reasonable results in the matter and radiation eras.\nIn the latter the effective Newton constant is slightly increased but consistent with recent\nbounds [57]. At late times, when matter has diluted away, we enter a de Sitter phase,\nwhere the expansion rate He is not dominated by the large CC, but instead it depends\nonly on the magnitudes of the parameter \u03b2 and \u039b in Eq. (39). Hence, the inclusion of a CC\ncounterterm which cancels \u039b with extremely high precision is not necessary for describing\nthe currently observed accelerated expansion. Our cosmological results are supported by\nthe existence of a black hole solution of the Kottler type, in which the effective CC parameter complies with the value of the final de Sitter expansion rate He . This suggests that\ncosmology and the astro-physical domain can be smoothly connected.\nThe robustness of the CC filter can be seen also from a different perspective. So far we\nhave considered \u039b to be a large constant generally of the order of the largest contribution\nto the CC. During the cosmic evolution, however, it is not unlikely that shifts \u03b4\u039b of\nvacuum energy occur, as a result of phase transitions for instance. We have shown that\nthese contributions, which are smaller than \u039b by definition, have no influence on gravity at\nleading order if we treat them as part of the matter sector described by r = \u03c1+p in Eq. (37).\nAlternatively, one could shift the cosmological term by \u039b \u2192 \u039b+\u03b4\u039b, but also this procedure\ndoes not change our results because the differences are of the order |\u03b4\u039b/\u039b| \u001c 1 contributing\nonly to the small correction terms. Hence, the exact value of \u039b is not important for the CC\nfilter effect even when vacuum shifts \u03b4\u039b arise dynamically as the universe evolves. Note\nthat \u03b4\u039b can be much larger than the current critical energy density despite being small\ncompared to \u039b.\nLet us now sketch some open points and discuss possible generalisations of our setup,\nwhich we want to address in the future. First, it is important to mention that our filter\neffect is based on the largeness of the CC and its universal energy-momentum structure.\nThis can be seen nicely in Eq. (34), where the CC contribution to the Ricci scalar R can\nbe completely removed by a suitable model building construction, which leads to Eq. (37).\nIt is clear that as long as \u039b dominates over other sources in the energy-momentum tensor\nand its trace (31), the procedure will be the same, which removes from R the dominating\nterm z \u223c \u039b as given in Eq. (32). Therefore, we can at least conjecture that matter sources\ndifferent from the perfect fluid form as well as other background metrics exhibit also the\nCC filter property. This would be useful for future studies of the Newtonian limit as well\nas perturbations in cosmology and astro-physical setups, which are more involved than the\nKottler solution. For the latter, it seems that vacuole space-times can be easily constructed\nonce a solution is found which interpolates between the matter era and the final de Sitter\nphase. The smoothness of R as shown in Fig. 1 suggests such a solution. More difficult\ncould be the analysis of the very early cosmological epoch when matter dominated over \u039b\n(if there was such a time) or during primordial inflation, respectively. In that case many\napproximations we used for the subsequent eras cannot be applied anymore, and a new\nanalysis is necessary.\n\n18\n\n\fApart from that, we have shown only one numerical example to support our analytical\nconsiderations, and it would be nice to have more numerical results discussing e.g. the\ntransition phases between different epochs and the constraints on the parameters \u03b2 and m.\nAlso the L3 > 0 case in Eq. (39) might correspond to an interesting solution, maybe it\ndescribes a contracting universe at late times because a vanishing matter density is not a\nsolution of Eq. (39). However, since we observe an accelerating cosmos, the L3 < 0 case\ndiscussed here is preferred.\nMoreover, we should mention that Palatini models are subject to constraints from\nastrophysical bodies and even small scale atomic physics, see e.g. [63, 35, 47, 48, 37].\nHowever, many results correspond to f (R)-type actions or to models, where the EinsteinHilbert term is amended by a correction, which becomes large for low curvature. It is clear\nthat our setup is not of this type. We will see in the future whether this is an advantage\nor not. Nevertheless, it might help that the Ricci scalar in Eq. (41) and the denominator\nfunction B in (44) approach a non-zero constant in the limit of vanishing matter. This\nsuggests a stable vacuum, which limits the values of the geometrical scalars from below.\nFinally, it has been argued in Refs. [47, 48] that the averaging over matter sources in the\nPalatini framework has some non-trivial aspects, too.\nIn the end, it would be interesting to know whether the CC filter effect is just a curiosity\nof our specific model in Eq. (29), or if there are completely different choices, which have\nthe same property. We want address these questions in the future.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Joan Sol\u00e0 and Hrvoje \u0160tefan\u010di\u0107 for useful discussions and comments.\nThis work has been supported in part by MEC and FEDER under project FPA200766665, by the Spanish Consolider-Ingenio 2010 program CPAN CSD2007-00042 and by\nDIUE/CUR Generalitat de Catalunya under project 2009SGR502.\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
