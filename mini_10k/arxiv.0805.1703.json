After a recent\n\narXiv:0805.1703v1 [hep-th] 12 May 2008\n\ndiscovery of simplified version of BLG action, which is based on the ordinary Lie-algebra structure, does not have coupling constants\nand extra dynamical fields, attention should be switched to the study of M2 brane dynamics. A viable brane analogue of Polyakov\nformalism and Belavin-Knizhnik theorem for strings can probably be provided by Palatini formalism for 3d (super)gravity.\n\nIn the context of general string theory [1] a variety of string and superstring models, linked by a number\nof duality relations, is naturally unified in a hypothetical \"M-theory\" [2], which in its most naive perturbative\nphase is represented by \"fundamental (super)membranes\". The BLG action [3, 4] resolves the long-standing\npuzzle [5] of finding the 3d Lagrangian with appropriate superconformal symmetry and thus opens a way to\ndeveloping the first-quantized theory of M2 branes. This implies that M-theory can now be studied in the\nsame constructive manner as bosonic and super-strings in 1980's [6, 7, 8]. Naturally, this ground-breaking\nachievement attracts enormous attention [9]-[25], and some minor drawbacks of original analysis in [3, 4] are\nnow fully cured.\nThe main obvious difficulty of original BLG formulation was its reliance upon sophisticated 3-algebra (quantum Nambu bracket) structure [26] \u2013 new for the fundamental physical considerations. The lack of experience\nand intuition about this structure caused certain confusion at the early stages: original BLG action was written\nonly for an artificial(?) example of SO(4) symmetry, problems were discovered with straightforward generalizations to other groups and even doubts appeared about the very existence of BLG action for the stack of N M2\nbranes with arbitrary N , which would require promotion of SO(4) to SU (N ). The key step in overcoming this\nproblem was analysis of the M2 \u2192 D2 conversion in [10], which linked the 3-algebra structure to conventional Lie\nalgebras, governing Yang-Mills and D-brane theories. Based on this analysis, in [14] a \"simplified\" BLG action\nwas introduced, which makes use of the Lie-algebra structure only (i.e. is based on \"reducible-to-Lie-algebra\"\nNambu bracket of [27], see eq.(2) below). The only new ingredient, distinguishing this version of BLG action\nfrom the ones familiar from string/brane studies was a pair of extra color-less octuplets \u03c6I and \u03c7A . While very\nsimple, this suggestion had serious problems as it was, originated from degeneracy of the underlying Nambu\nbracket and the lack of total antisymmetry of 3-algebra structure constants: this made original supersymmetry\nproof of [3] unapplicable and the action in [14] potentially non-supersymmetric. Thus it was meant to be a\ntoy-example, showing the direction to eliminate unnecessary(?) elements of the BLG construction, but still\npossessing some extra fields and requiring some further tuning. A natural next step was to look at a central\nextension, lifting degeneracy of Nambu bracket [15] \u2013 and this was finally done in a triple of wonderful papers\n[25]. They resolved the discrepancy between [14] and BLG approach in an elegant way, by changing the nature\n\u02c6 A\nof the extra fields \u03c6, \u03c7: they are actually auxiliary, non-dynamical variables. Kinetic terms (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6I )2 and \u03c7\u0304A \u2202\u03c7\nA\n1\n1\n\u02c6 A + \u03c7\u0304A \u2202\u02c6\u03c7\u0303A where \u03c6\u0303, \u03c7\u0303 is still another pair of color-less\n \u0304 \u2202\u03c7\nof [14] are substituted in [25] by \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0303I \u2202\u03bc \u03c6I and 2 \u03c7\u0303\n2\noctuplets which do not appear anywhere else in the action and thus serve as Lagrange multipliers, eliminating\nthe fluctuations of the unwanted \u03c6 and \u03c7 fields. In other words, the modified version of the simplified BLG\naction of [14] is now [25]:\n\u0010\n\u00112 i\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u2212 tr D\u03bc \u03c6I \u2212 B\u03bc \u03c6I + tr\u03c8 A D\u0302 \u03c8 A \u2212 B\u0302\u03c7A +\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\ni  \u0304 A \u02c6 A i A\u0010 \u02c6 A\nI\nI\nI\n+ \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0303 \u2212 tr(B\u03bc \u03c6 ) \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c7\u0303 \u2202\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u0304 \u2202 \u03c7\u0303 \u2212 tr(B\u03bc \u03c8 A ) +\n2\n2\n\u0011\n\u00112\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u0010\n1 \u0010 I J K\nj K\n+ \u01eb tr F\u03bc\u03bd B\u03bb \u2212 tr \u03c6 [\u03c6 , \u03c6 ] + \u03c6 [\u03c6 , \u03c6I ] + \u03c6K [\u03c6I , \u03c6J ] +\n2\n12\n\u0011\n\u0010\ni\ni IJ I \u0010 A J B \u0011 i IJ \u0010 A I J \u0011 B\nA\nI\nJ\nB\n+ \u0393AB \u03c6 tr \u03c8\u0304 [\u03c6 , \u03c8 ] + \u0393AB tr \u03c8\u0304 [\u03c6 , \u03c6 ] \u03c7 \u2212 \u0393IJ\nAB \u03c7\u0304 tr [\u03c6 , \u03c6 ]\u03c8\n2\n4\n4\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fIt essentially differs from eq.(21) of [14] in the second line.1 Here \u03c6I and \u03c8 A with I = 1, . . . , 8 and A = 1, . . . , 8\nare real- and Grassmann-valued elements of the vector and spinor representations of the SO(8) group respectively\n(related by octonionic triality to the second spinor representation, where the N = 8 SUSY transformation\nparameter takes values). They are also N \u00d7 N matrices, i.e. belong to adjoint representation of the gauge\ngroup G = SU (N ). A\u03bc is the corresponding connection, also in the adjoint of G, D\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 [A\u03bc , \u03c6],\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc + [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ], and B\u03bc is an auxiliary adjoint vector field (not a connection). The other\nauxiliary fields \u03c6I , \u03c6\u0303I and their superpartners \u03c7A , \u03c7\u0303A are G-singlets (are color-less), possibly fragments of\nKac-Moody extension of G. See [14, 25] for further details.\nAs explained in [25],\n\u2022 The action (1) is N = 8 supersymmetric due to original BL theorem [3], because it is now based on the\n3-algebra with totally antisymmetric structure constants, which is a central extension of the degenerate one [27]\nused in [14]:\n[X, Y, Z] = tr X * [Y, Z] + tr Y * [Z, X] + tr Z * [X, Y ] + \u03b6 * tr (X[Y, Z])\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b6 is a central element, different from unity matrix I and related to it\uf8ebby non-trivial scalar\nproduct < I, I > =\n\uf8f6\n0 \u22121 0\n< \u03b6, \u03b6 > = 0, < I, \u03b6 > = < \u03b6, I > = \u22121, so that the 3-algebra metric is \uf8ed \u22121 0 0 \uf8f8 and f abcI = \u2212f abc \u03b6 =\n0\n0 h\nabc\nIabc\n\u2212f\n= \u2212f\n. The last term of (2) was absent in [14] and this made the 3-bracket degenerate and the\nstructure constants (with the forth index raised by 3-algebra metric) not totally antisymmetric. The \u03c6, \u03c7 fields\nare associated with the I (matrix-trace) generator, while \u03c6\u0303, \u03c7\u0303 \u2013 with the central element \u03b6. Non-trivial 3-algebra\nmetric implies the \u03c6-\u03c6\u0303 and \u03c7-\u03c7\u0303 mixing form of the kinetic terms in (1).\n\u2022 The would-be coupling constant in front of non-quadratic terms in (1) can be absorbed into rescaling of \u03c6\nand \u03c7, accompanied by rescaling of \u03c6\u0303 and \u03c7\u0303 in the opposite direction. This lack of this feature was one of the\nproblems in [14], and in (1) we have an action, which has no dimensionless coupling constants, as required in\nM-theory.\n\u2022 All the unwanted extra fields \u03c6, \u03c7, \u03c6\u0303, \u03c7\u0303 are auxiliary: they do not propagate and contribute only through\nboundary terms2 (i.e. to correlators) and zero-modes.\n\u2022 The fact that Lagrange multiplier \u03c6\u0303 nullifies only \u2202 2 \u03c6 rather than \u03c6 itself is very important, because this\nallows the zero-mode \u03c6 = const. Among other effects, this zero mode can form a condensate, producing a term\n< \u03c6 >2 tr B 2 from the first item in (1), which, after auxiliary field B\u03bc is integrated away, converts the Chern2\nSimons interaction trF \u2227 B into kinetic Yang-Mills term < \u03c6 >\u22122 tr F\u03bc\u03bd\nfor connection A\u03bc . This means that\ndespite \u03c6 fields are now auxiliary, the crucially important possibility to use them for the M2 \u2192 D2 conversion\na la [10] is preserved.\nAll this means that today we possess a perfectly simple version (1) of the BLG action for arbitrary number\nof M2 branes, there are no longer doubts about its existence for arbitrary gauge group SU (N ), there are no\ncoupling constants, no extra dynamical fields, and it is clearly related to the other brane actions, as required\nby embeddings of d = 10 superstring models into the d = 11 M-theory. The road is now open for building up\nthe first-quantized theory of M2 branes (supermembranes). This implies that attention can now be shifted from\nthe study of 3-algebra structure (where a lot of interesting questions still remain) to the other issues: we know\nwhat should be the crucial next steps from the history of first-quantized theory of superstrings.\nConstructing the action (1) can be considered as the very first step, corresponding to substitution of NambuGoto action for bosonic strings by a \u03c3-model action, of which (1) is supposed to be a (super)membrane analogue.\nIn the case of membranes the problem was more complicated, because Nambu-Goto action is ill (does not damp\nfluctuations) from the very beginning, no approach to bosonic membrane is still available (problems look more\nsevere than the tachyon of bosonic string) and one should begin directly from the supersymmetric case, moreover\nsupersymmetry should be immediately extended to N = 8. Thus it may be not too surprising that we had to\nwait till 2008 to have this action written down...\nIn the case of strings the next big step was consideration of world sheets with non-trivial topologies, with two\ncomplementary formalisms finally developed for this purpose (and still not fully related, see [29] for description\nof the corresponding problems). One is the Polyakov formalism [6], promoting the \u03c3-model action to arbitrary\ncurved 2d geometries and generalizing the treatment of relativistic particle in [30]. Another is equilateraltriangulation approach, nicely expressed in terms of matrix models [31] and formally equivalent to substitution\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP\n\u03c6I \u03c6J tr [\u03c6I , \u03c6K ][\u03c6j , \u03c6K ]\n\n1A\n\ntrivial mistake of [14] in the \u03c66 term (omitted item 2\n\n2 In\n\nthis respect the action in the \u03c6-\u03c6\u0303 sector is reminiscent of the one, considered in [28].\n\nI<J\n\n2\n\nis also corrected in [25] and in (1).\n\n\fof smooth 2d-geometries by Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants [32]. In the case of membranes this step is going to\nbe a hard exercise, already because the topological classification of 3d world volumes is far more complicated than\nin 2d. Still, the very first movement \u2013 introduction of 3d geometry into (1) by both above-mentioned methods\n\u2013 should be straightforward, and undoubtedly very interesting. For a variety of reasons it seems natural to\ndo this in the modern BF-version of Palatini formalism, which is now widely popularized by controversial, but\ninspiring papers of G.Lisi [33]. Of certain help can be also comparison with the Green-Schwarz formalism for\nthe superstrings [34], where world-sheet action has some common features with (1): it also looks non-linear,\nbut actually non-linearities concern only the zero-modes and boundary effects.\nOf crucial importance should be identification of the relevant world-sheet-geometry degrees of freedom\n(moduli), which the action is going to depend upon. This is not the 3d metric or dreibein and spin-connection\nthemselves \u2013 already because of the general covariance. However, as we know from experience with strings, the\nremaining degrees of freedom (Liouville field) can also be irrelevant (or identified with the other physical fields\n[35]), so that the only remaining moduli are those of the 2d complex structures: finitely many for any given 2d\ntopology. It is the analogue of Belavin-Knizhnik theorem [7, 8] that formulates this statement for strings, which\nshould be the next big discovery in the story of BLG actions. Again, there are many complications in the case\nof membranes: as already mentioned, from the very beginning we need supersymmetry (and the corresponding\nproblem for superstrings was partly resolved only quite recently! [36, 37]). Moreover, the analogue of Riemann\ntheta-function theory [38] in 3d is not yet at our disposal \u2013 and here we should face the same problems as\nthe other approaches to 3d topological theories [39]: there are no conventional terms to express our answers\nthrough...\nIn this short summary we do not speculate about the resolution of all these problems, i.e. about filling the\nempty spaces in the right column of the following table:\n\n(super)strings\n\n(super)membranes\n\n2d Nambu-Goto action \u2192 2d \u03c3-model action\n\nspirit of membrane \u2192 simplified BLG action (1)\n\nPolyakov formalism:\nintroduction of 2d metric,\ncritical dimensions (where massless excitations occur),\nsum over geometries,\nsum over topologies,\nrelation to equilateral triangulations approach\n\nBF-version of Palatini formalism in 3d\n\nBelavin-Knizhnik theorem:\nreduction of sum over metrics to sum over moduli\n\ntopology of world sheet:\nspin structures and GSO projection,\nstring field theory,\nboundary correlators and AdS/CFT correspondence\n\ntopology of the target space (compactifications):\ngeneric 2d conformal theories,\nT -dualities,\nother dualities\n\n...\n\n3\n\n\fOur goal is to emphasize that we are now in front of the new and interesting breakthrough into the unknown \u2013\nthe possibility opened to us by the timely formulated problem [5], a brilliant insight [3, 4] and qualified polishing\n[9]-[24], culminated in [25] in the elegant formula (1), which is going to be \u2013 perhaps, in some reshaped and\nredecorated version \u2013 a new focus of attention in string theory in the coming years.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is partly supported by Russian Federal Nuclear Energy Agency and Russian Academy of Sciences,\nby the joint grant 06-01-92059-CE, by NWO project 047.011.2004.026, by INTAS grant 05-1000008-7865, by\nANR-05-BLAN-0029-01 project, by RFBR grant 07-02-00645 and by the Russian President's Grant of Support\nfor the Scientific Schools NSh-3035.2008.2\n\nReferences\n[1] M.Green, J.Schwarz and E.Witten, Superstring Theory, Cambridge University Press, 1987;\nA.Polyakov, Gauge Fields and Strings, 1987;\nJ.Polchinsky, String Theory, Cambridge University Press, 1998;\nA.Morozov, String Theory: What is It?
