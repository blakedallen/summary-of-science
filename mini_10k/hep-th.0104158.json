The latter are\nshown to satisfy braid relations that allow one to prove the locality of the former.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Motivation\nLiouville theory seems to be a kind of universal building block for a variety of models for twodimensional gravity and non-trivial backgrounds in string theory. Some aspects of it were important\nfor understanding what the matrix models of 2D gravity actually describe (see e.g. [GM]), and it\nkeeps popping up in sometimes unexpected circumstances such as the the physics of membranes in\nstring theory (e.g. [SW]). In the context of string theory, Liouville theory and close relatives such as\nthe SL(2) or SL(2)/U(1) WZNW models seem to be the simplest examples where the new qualitative\nfeatures of nontrivial (possibly curved) non-compact backgrounds can be studied.\nFor all this it is crucial that Liouville theory, as indeed supported by many investigations of this\nissue, can be quantized as a conformal field theory (CFT), implying in particular that the space of\nstates forms a representation of the Virasoro algebra. What makes the analysis of the quantized\ntheory much more difficult as compared to other conformal field theories is the fact that the set of\nVirasoro representations that make up the space of states is continuous. This can be viewed as a\nR 2\u03c0\nreflection of the noncompactness of the space in which the Liouville zero mode q \u2261 0 d\u03c3\u03a6(\u03c3)\ntakes values.\nLiouville theory may furthermore be seen as probably the simplest prototypical example for a\nclass of conformal field theories called non-compact CFT which have continuous spectrum of representations of the Virasoro algebra. It may well be expected to play a role in the development of\n\n\f-02a general theory of such CFT's that is analogous to the role of the minimal models as prototype for\nrational CFT. This is in fact one of our main motivations: We believe that other non-compact CFT\nwill share many features with Liouville theory that distinguish non-compact from rational CFT.\nMoreover, once the technical tools for the proper investigation of Liouville theory are established, it\nshould not be too difficult to generalize them to other non-compact CFT. For example, many results\nfrom Liouville theory can be carried over fairly directly to the H3+ -WZNW model [Te3].\n1.2. Aims and scope\nThis paper focuses on the understanding of Liouville theory on a (space-time) cylinder with circumference 2\u03c0, time-coordinate t and (periodic) space-coordinate \u03c3 as a two dimensional quantum\nfield theory in its own right. (Semi-)classically the theory is defined by the action\n(1)\n\nSc =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c6\n2\n2\n(\u2202t \u03c6) \u2212 (\u2202\u03c3 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03bcc e .\nd\u03c3\n16\u03c0\n\u0012\n\nWe will attempt to describe the corresponding quantum theory that will depend on the parameter ~\nwhich we will write as ~ = b2 . It turns out that there are two interesting regimes for the parameter\nb that one may consider: b \u2208 (0, 1] \u2282 R (\"weak coupling\") and b = ei\u03c6 , \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c02 ) (\"strong\ncoupling\"). One aim is to construct a quantum Liouville field \u03c6 that in the semi-classical limit\n1\n\u03c6.\nb \u2192 0 corresponds to \u03c6 via the rescaling \u03c6 \u223c 2b\nb\u21920\n\nThis paper grew out of an attempt to write a review of Liouville theory. We tried to develop a\ncoherent picture that takes into account the different perspectives of path-integral approach, bootstrap, canonical quantization and operator approach. In doing so we felt forced to go beyond the\nexisting literature as the listed approaches had not been sufficiently developed to allow for their\nmutual comparison. The character of this paper will therefore be somewhat intermediate between\nreview, preview and original contribution: It has the character of a review in the sense that we try\nto exhibit the main ideas and results rather than all technical details. However, since many of the\nresults and arguments presented here have not appeared in the literature yet, we have included short\npresentations of at least some key technical points.\nWe will not try to cover Liouville theory in all of its aspects and ramifications. We will not discuss\nimportant and interesting topics such as\n\u2022 OTHER BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND SUPERSYMMETRIC VERSIONS OF L IOUVILLE THE Instead of periodic boundary conditions in the spatial direction one may also consider\nORY\nLiouville theory on the real line [dHJ], or the strip with boundary conditions that preserve\nconformal invariance at its end-points, see e.g. [GN2][CG] and references therein for early\nwork, and [FZZ][TB][ZZ2] for more recent progress. Some exact results on N = 1 Liouville\ntheory have been obtained in [RS][Po]. It would be quite important to have similar results for\nN = 2 Liouville (for some discussion see e.g. [KS]).\n\u2022 L IOUVILLE THEORY ON THE LATTICE\nEarly works include [FT][B1][B2]. Substantial\nprogress in this direction was made quite recently, see [FKV] and references therein, but we\nfelt unable to explain the precise connections to the material present here at the present stage\nof development. Nevertheless, we would like to at least mention the very recent result of L.\nFaddeev and R. Kashaev [FK], where the spectrum of the Hamiltonian in the lattice Liouville\n\n\f-03-\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\ntheory [FKV] is determined on the basis of [Ka2]. This result nicely confirms our claim that\nthe spectrum is purely continuous both in the weak and strong coupling regimes.\nC ONNECTIONS WITH T EICHM \u00dcLLER THEORY AND QUANTIZATION OF T EICHM \u00dcLLER\nSPACE\n(For the former see e.g. the review [Ta], on the latter topic see e.g.\n[V][Ka1][CF][Ka2] and references therein). Quantization of Teichm\u00fcller space is expected\n[V] to encode topological information on the space of conformal blocks of Liouville theory,\nwhich should be equivalent (see [Ka2] for strong evidence) to the description of the duality\ntransformations on spaces of conformal blocks that was proposed in [PT1] and which will be\ndiscussed in Part IV.\nN ON - UNITARY SPECTRA , \" ELLIPTIC SECTOR \" There exist proposals for versions of quantum Liouville theory that have spectra involving non-unitary representations of the Virasoro\nalgebra, see e.g. [GS3] and references therein. Related to the lack of unitarity one finds unusual hermiticity properties of the exponential field operators. In the present paper we will be\nexclusively concerned with the possibility of having a quantization of Liouville theory that\npreserves unitarity.\nC LOSED DISCRETE SUB - ALGEBRAS OF THE ALGEBRA OF VERTEX OPERATORS THAT\nIt was proposed in [G2] (see also [GR1][GR2])\nCREATE UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS\nthat for certain special values of the parameter b spectrum and vertex operator algebra of Liouville theory admit a \"unitary truncation\" in the following sense: There exists a Hilbert space\nHd spanned by a discrete set of unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra, equipped\nwith a realization of a discrete family of local vertex operators with real positive conformal\ndimensions. This would allow to construct non-critical bosonic string models. Let us remark,\nhowever, that our discussion will apply to the values of b, for which the proposal of [G2] was\nmade. Nevertheless, it could be that the operator algebra that we discuss here shows some\nkind of \"reducibility\" for certain values of b, which would lead to the proposal of [G2]\nsee also our remark in Part IV, Subsection 19.7.\nA PPLICATIONS TO MODELS OF 2D GRAVITY\n(see e.g. [GM])\n\nThe author will be grateful to anybody pointing out further omissions or missing references concerning the material that is covered in the present paper.\n\n1.3. Overview\nIf a conformal field theory fits into the framework introduced in [BPZ], it is essentially fully\ncharacterized by its spectrum of primary fields and the full set of three point functions. What we\nwill call the \"DOZZ-proposal\" (where DOZZ stands for Dorn, Otto, Al. and A. Zamolodchikov)\namounts to the proposal that Liouville theory fits into the framework of [BPZ], together with an\nexplicit formula for the three point functions of the primary fields [DO][ZZ].\nAnd indeed, as we will discuss in more detail, one can show that essentially all of Liouville\ntheory is encoded in these pieces of information: Thanks to conformal symmetry it is possible to\nreconstruct all correlation functions of primary fields from the three-point function by summing over\nintermediate states. Primary fields and the energy momentum tensor generate the operator algebra\nof the theory. Mixed correlation functions involving the energy momentum tensor together with\n\n\f-04primary fields are reduced to correlation functions of only primary fields by the conformal Ward\nidentities.\nFrom that point of view the main problem for establishing the validity of the DOZZ-proposal is\nto show crossing symmetry of the amplitudes that can be reconstructed by means of conformal symmetry in terms of the particular formula for the three point functions that was proposed in [DO][ZZ].\nOnce this is established, one has ample reason to view the theory that is characterized by the DOZZproposal as a quantization of classical Liouville theory: Let us only mention that the semi-classical\nlimit of the formula proposed in [DO][ZZ] indeed matches the result of direct semi-classical calculations [ZZ].\nIn the present paper we will try to explain why the DOZZ-proposal works and what the resulting\npicture of the physics of quantum Liouville theory looks like.\nIn Part I we begin by formulating more precisely what we refer to as the \"DOZZ-proposal\". Afterwards some of the original motivation for that proposal will be discussed which came from the\npath-integral approach to Liouville theory as initiated in [GL]. Our main objective in that Part I is\nto explain how Liouville theory can be reconstructed on the basis of the DOZZ-proposal: How to\nreconstruct the Hilbert space, operators corresponding to the fields, their correlation functions etc..\nSome features arise that are unfamiliar from rational conformal field theories: For example, one does\nnot find the SL(2, C)-invariant state |0i in the spectrum. However, it will be shown that a distributional interpretation of the \"state\" |0i is not only natural in a theory with continuous spectrum, but\nalso makes operator-state correspondence and the interpretation of correlation functions as \"vacuum\nexpectation values\" work in much the same way as in rational conformal field theories.\nThe following Part II discusses some aspects of the quantum Liouville physics as encoded in\nthe DOZZ-proposal. We begin by discussing to what extend the DOZZ-proposal can be shown\nto represent a canonical quantization of Liouville theory: It is possible to reconstruct a field \u03c6 that\nweakly (within matrix elements) satisfies the canonical commutation relations and a natural quantum\nversion of the Liouville equation of motion. One might then hope to have a representation where\nthe Liouville zero mode q is diagonal, so that one could describe the physics of Liouville theory\nin terms of wave-functions \u03c8(q) on \"target-space\". And indeed, such a representation would allow\none to get natural interpretations for many features of the DOZZ-proposal in terms of scattering off\nthe Liouville potential. However, at present we only have good control over such a representation\nin the region corresponding to zero mode q \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the \"asymptotic boundary of target space\"\nwhere the Liouville interaction vanishes. This is good enough for setting up the scattering picture\nthat we had mentioned above. But it is not clear so far how to describe Liouville physics for finite\nvalues of q, in the \"bulk of target space\". It is not even clear whether such a representation with\ndiagonal zero mode q exists at all: The zero mode operator q has a rather complicated description in\na representation where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, making it difficult to control properties such as\nself-adjointness.\nOur third part is devoted to the operator approach to Liouville theory. Classically, one has a\ncanonical transformation from free field theory to the interacting Liouville theory. In the operator\napproach one tries to quantize this transformation, i.e. to construct Liouville field operators in terms\nof the quantized free field. We outline recent results that lead to a complete construction of general\nexponential Liouville fields within such a framework (more details will be given in a forthcoming\npublication). Their matrix elements are given by the three point function proposed in [DO][ZZ].\n\n\f-05This construction is based on the construction of a class of covariant chiral operators that form the\nbuilding blocks of the exponential fields. Locality of the exponential fields can be controlled thanks\nto the existence of exchange- (braid-) relations that are satisfied by the covariant chiral operators.\nThese results form the technical core for the construction of Liouville theory that we propose.\nConceptually it is interesting to compare this approach with the discussion in Part II: This furnishes another interpretation for the reflection operator R that describes the scattering of wavepackets off the Liouville-potential \"wall\": Classically one finds that the map from the free field\nto the Liouville field is two-to-one. This ambiguity is expressed in the quantum theory by the existence of an operator S that commutes with the Liouville field operators. The operator S coincides\nprecisely with the reflection operator R. This observation may lead one to identify the free field\ntheory on which the operator approach is based with the free field theory that describes the asymptotic in- and out-states of the scattering off the Liouville potential. Alternatively, one may view the\noperator approach as providing a reconstruction of Liouville theory from the free field theory \"living\non the asymptotic boundary of target space\".\nWe finally discuss in Part IV how Liouville theory fits into a \"chiral bootstrap\" framework such as\nthe one introduced for rational conformal field theories in [MS][FFK]. This not only yields insight\ninto the mathematics behind the consistency of Liouville theory (fusion of unitary Virasoro representations, relation to quantum group representation theory), but also provides a useful framework\nto complete the verification of locality and crossing symmetry for the exponential Liouville fields\nconstructed in Part III.\n1.4. Notational conventions\nThroughout we will use the convention that for a local field F , the notation F (z, z\u0304) denotes the\neuclidean field on the Riemann sphere, F (\u03c4, \u03c3) or F (w, w\u0304), w = \u03c4 + i\u03c3 its counterpart on the\neuclidean cylinder, F (t, \u03c3) the minkowskian version, and F (\u03c3) \u2261 F (0, \u03c3).\n\n\f-06-\n\nPart I. THE DOZZ PROPOSAL\nWe will start by discussing what we call the DOZZ-proposal. In a nutshell it consists of two\ningredients: (i) Liouville theory fits into a rather mild generalization of the BPZ-formalism for twodimensional conformal field theories, and (ii) a proposal for an explicit representation of the three\npoint function (\"DOZZ-formula\"). The DOZZ-proposal will be formulated more more explicitly in\nthe next section. Afterwards we will present some motivation for the DOZZ-formula from the pathintegral point of view. In the remainder of this part we will try to explain how really all of Liouville\ntheory is encoded in these two pieces of information.\n\n2. CONFORMAL SYMMETRY AND THREE POINT FUNCTION\nWithin a formalism for conformal field theories such as that introduced in [BPZ] one assumes\nLiouville theory to be fully characterized by the set of all vacuum expectation values of the form\n!\nN\nR\nS\nY\nY\nY\n(2)\nV\u03b1i (zi , z\u0304i ) .\nT\u0304 (w\u0304r )\n\u03a9\nT (wr )\nr=1\n\ns=1\n\ni=1\n\nT (z) and T\u0304 (z\u0304) are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic components of the energy-momentum\ntensor respectively, and the V\u03b1 (z), \u03b1 \u2208 C are the primary fields.

Descendants\nIt will also be useful to keep in mind that further fields can be generated from the field V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304)\nby \"acting on it with T (z), T\u0304 (z\u0304)\". More precisely, let W\u03b1 be the representation of the Virasoro\nalgebra that is generated by acting with the generators Ln , L\u0304n n < 0 on the vector v\u03b1 that satisfies\nL0 v\u03b1 = L\u03040 v\u03b1 = \u2206\u03b1 v\u03b1 , Ln v\u03b1 = 0 = L\u0304n v\u03b1 for n > 0. Clearly W\u03b1 \u2261 V\u03b1 \u2297 V\u03b1 where V\u03b1 is a\nVerma-module over the Virasoro algebra (see Section 6 for a summary of some relevant results on\nthe representation theory of the Virasoro algebra).\nOne may then define fields V\u03b1 (\u03b6|z, z\u0304) parameterized by vectors \u03b6 \u2208 W\u03b1 by means of the following recursive definition: Let V\u03b1 (v\u03b1 |z, z\u0304) \u2261 V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304), and extend the definition to a basis for W\u03b1 by\nmeans of the recursion relation\n\u221e\nX\n(5)\n(w \u2212 z)n\u22122 V\u03b1 (L\u2212n \u03b6|z, z\u0304),\nT (w)V\u03b1 (\u03b6|z, z\u0304) =\nn=\u2212N (\u03b6\u03b1 )\n\nand its obvious counterpart with T\u0304 (z\u0304). The number N (\u03b6) appearing in (5) is the smallest positive\ninteger such that Ln \u03b6 = 0 for any n > N (\u03b6). Equation (5) is to be understood as definition of\n\n\f-08V\u03b1 (L\u2212n \u03b6|z, z\u0304) in terms of V\u03b1 (L\u2212m \u03b6|z, z\u0304), m < n by shuffling the terms with m < n to the left\nhand side of the equation, taking n \u2212 2 derivatives w.r.t. w and finally the limit w \u2192 z, explicitly:\n\n(6)\n\n(n \u2212 2)!

The DOZZ-formula\n\nThe second main ingredient of the DOZZ-proposal is an explicit formula for the function\nC(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) that represents the part of the three point function which is not determined by\nSL(2, C)-invariance:\nLet us define the special function \u03a5(x) by the integral representation\n\u0001t \u0015\n\u00132\nZ\u221e \u0014\u0012\nsinh2 Q\nQ\ndt\n\u2212t\n2 \u2212x 2\n\u2212x e \u2212\n(8)\nlog \u03a5(x) =\nt\nt\n2\nsinh bt\n2 sinh 2b\n0\n\nThe formula as proposed in [ZZ] is the following:\nP3\ni\nh\n2 (Q\u2212\ni=1 \u03b1i )/b\n\u00d7\nC(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 , \u03b13 ) = \u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(b2 )b2\u22122b\n(9)\n\u03a50 \u03a5(2\u03b11 )\u03a5(2\u03b12 )\u03a5(2\u03b13 )\n\u00d7\n.\n\u03a5(\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 Q)\u03a5(\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 )\u03a5(\u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03a5(\u03b13 + \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )\nFor later use let us summarize a couple of relevant properties of the \u03a5-function. First, it is useful to\nnote that it can also be constructed out of the Barnes Double Gamma function \u03932 (x|\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) [Ba] as\n1\n,\n\u0393b (x) = \u03932 (x|b, b\u22121 ), where\n\u0393b (x)\u0393b (Q \u2212 x)\n!\n\u221e\n\u2202 X\n\u2212t\n(s + n1 \u03c91 + n2 \u03c92 )\n.\nlog \u03932 (s|\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) =\n\u2202t n ,n =0\n\n\u03a5b (x) =\n(10)\n\n1\n\n2\n\nt=0\n\nOne may thereby benefit from the existence of some literature on the Barnes Double Gamma function, cf. e.g. [Ba, Sh].\nThe following basic properties follow then directly from the integral representation (8) or results\non \u0393b found in [Sh]:\nF UNCTIONAL EQUATIONS\n(11)\n\n\u03a5(x + b) = \u03b3(bx)b1\u22122bx \u03a5(x).\n\n\f-09S ELF - DUALITY\n\u03a5b (x) = \u03a5b\u22121 (x).\n\n(12)\nR EFLECTION\n(13)\n\nPROPERTY\n\n\u03a5b (x) = \u03a5b (Q \u2212 x).\n\n\u03a5b (x) is entire analytic with zeros at x = \u2212nb \u2212 mb\u22121 and x = Q + nb + mb\u22121,\nA NALYTICITY\nn, m \u2208 Z\u22650 .\nA SYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR\n(14)\n\n\u03a5b (x) \u223c x2 log x + 32 x2 \u2213 \u03c0ix2 + Qx log x + O(x)\n\nfor I(x) \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\n\n3. PATH INTEGRAL APPROACH\nWe will now discuss some of the motivation that has led Dorn, Otto and Al.B., A.B. Zamolodchikov to propose the formula (9): Let us consider fields V\u03b1 (w, w\u0304) on the euclidean cylinder, which\ncorrespond to the classical functions e2\u03b1\u03c6 of the Liouville field. One looks for a representation for\nthe correlation functions of the fields V\u03b1 (w, w\u0304) as an integral over all possible field configurations,\nZ\nN\nY\n\u0001\n(15)\ne2\u03b1i \u03c6(wi ,w\u0304i ) ,\n\u03a9 V\u03b1N (wN , w\u0304N ) . . . V\u03b11 (w1 , w\u03041 ) = lim\n[D\u03c6] e\u2212ST [\u03c6]\nT \u2192\u221e\n\ni=1\n\n\u2212ST [\u03c6]\n\nwhere the configuration \u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) is weighted with a measure [D\u03c6]e\nwhich is written in terms\nof the euclidean action\n\u0013\nZT\nZ2\u03c0 \u0012\n1\n(16)\nST [\u03c6] =\n|\u2202w \u03c6|2 + \u03bce2b\u03c6 .\nd\u03c4 d\u03c3\n\u03c0\n\u2212T\n\n0\n\nWe refer to [Ta] for a discussion of conformal symmetry in the perturbative path integral framework,\nwith interesting links to Teichm\u00fcller theory. Here we restrict ourselves to a discussion of the in\u0002 \u0003\nformation that can be obtained when the measure [D\u03c6] factorizes as [D\u03c6] = d\u03c60 D\u03c6\u0304 , where the\nLiouville field has been split into zero mode and oscillator parts, \u03c6(w, w\u0304) = \u03c60 + \u03c6\u0304(w, w\u0304). This\napproach goes back to [GL] and was further developed by [D2][DK].\n3.1. Path integral on the Riemann sphere\nFor many purposes it is convenient not to perform the path integral over fields \u03c6 defined on the\ncylinder, but instead to integrate over configurations that are defined on the Riemann-sphere, which is\nrelated to the cylinder by the conformal mapping z = ew . A bit of care is needed when transforming\nthe action (16).\nCorresponding to a conformal transformation z = z(w) one may consider the following transformation law of the Liouville field \u03c6:\n2\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c6(z) = \u03c6\u2032 (w(z)) \u2212\n\nQ\ndz\n.\nlog\n2\ndw\n\n\f-10If the parameter Q is chosen equal to Qc = b\u22121 , one has invariance of the classical action (16) up\nto boundary terms. In the case of the transformation z = ew one finds that (16) is transformed into\nthe following expression:\nZ\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\nQ\n1\n2\n2\n2b\u03c6\n+\n(18)\nd z (\u2202a \u03c6) + 4\u03c0\u03bce\ndl \u03c6 + 2Q2 log R,\nST [\u03c6] =\n4\u03c0\n\u03c0R\nAR\n\n\u2202AR\n\nwhere AR is an annulus around z = 0 with outer and inner radii given by R = eT and 1/R\nrespectively. The boundary term is often interpreted as describing the effect of a \"background charge\n\u2212Q at infinity\". In the case of the quantum theory one will have to consider values of Q that differ\nfrom the classical value Qc = b\u22121 .\n3.2. Scaling behavior\nWe will now assume that the measure [D\u03c6]e\u2212S[\u03c6] factorizes as\n[D\u03c6]e\u2212S[\u03c6] = d\u03c60 [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 ,\n\n(19)\n\nand that the measure for the integration over the zero mode \u03c60 is translationally invariant. The latter\nassumption does not only require translational invariance of d\u03c60 , but also that\n[D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 = [D\u03c6\u0304]e2ba \u03bc,\u03c60 \u2212a ,\n\n(20)\nR\n\n2\n\n2b\u03c6\n\n1\nas is satisfied by the weight e\u03bc d ze . By introducing a new integration variable \u03c6\u20320 = \u03c60 + 2b\nln \u03bc\nit is then possible to extract the \u03bc-dependence of vacuum expectation values (15):\n\u0001\nN\n\u0011\n\u03a9 V\u03b1N (zN , z\u0304N ) . . . V\u03b11 (z1 , z\u03041 ) \u03bc =\nX\n1\u0010\n(21)\n.\n\u03b1\nQ\n\u2212\ns\n\u2261\n\u0001\ni\nb\n= \u03bcs \u03a9 V\u03b1N (zN , z\u0304N ) . . . V\u03b11 (z1 , z\u03041 ) \u03bc=1 ,\ni=1\n\nThe fact that the dependence of vacuum expectation values on \u03bc is generically not analytic in \u03bc\nindicates that perturbation theory w.r.t. the variable \u03bc can not lead to convergent series expansions\nfor the expectation values.\n3.3. Relation to free field?\nLet us consider the question of convergence of the integration overR \u03c60 . We will assume that\n2\n2b\u03c60\nthe upper limit in the \u03c60 does yield any problems due to the factor e\u2212\u03bc d ze\ncoming from the\nLiouville-interaction. The leading asymptotic behavior for \u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e is proportional to e\u22122sb\u03c60 , so\nwe expect convergence of the integration over \u03c60 as long as R(s) < 0.\nThe fact that the dependence of the fields e2\u03b1\u03c6 on the variable \u03b1 is analytic suggests that the\ndependence of the vacuum expectation values on the variable s might be analytic as long as the\n\u03c60 -integration converges. In the same spirit one might hope to get a meromorphic continuation to\nR(s) > 0 by standard regularization of the \u03c60 -integration [GS]: This would be possible if the asymptotic behavior of [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 for \u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e was known. The vanishing of the Liouville interaction\nfor \u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e leads one to suspect that [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 is asymptotic to the Gaussian measure of the path\nintegral for a free field theory, with corrections given by the interaction term:\n\u0012Z\n\u0013n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212\u03bc)n e2bn\u03c60\n2\n2b\u03c6\u0304\n\u223c [D\u03c6\u0304]F,Q\n[D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60\nd ze\n(22)\n.\nq\u2192\u2212\u221e\nn!\nn=0\n\n\f-11We use the notation [D\u03c6\u0304]F,Q to denote the standard Gaussian measure in free field theory with\nbackground charge \u2212Q, see [DF1] or equations (25), (26) below for its definition. We have included\nin (22) corrections\nwhich are subleading for \u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.

Continuation in s\nIt is then natural to look for a \"continuation\" of the results for s \u2208 Z\u22650 to all of C as a candidate\nfor the three point function at generic values of s. More precisely, the task is to find an expression\nthat depends meromorphically on s and has poles for s \u2208 Z\u22650 with residues given by (27)(28). It\nis natural and important to demand that this continuation preserves the zi -dependence of the three\npoint function as given in (27), i.e. that it takes the general SL(2, C)-invariant form\n\u0001\n(30)\n\u03a9 V\u03b13 (z3 , z\u03043 )V\u03b12 (z2 , z\u03042 )V\u03b11 (z1 , z\u03041 ) = |z32 |2\u220632 |z31 |2\u220631 |z21 |2\u220621 C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ).\nThe task is then to find an expression for C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) that has poles for s \u2208 Z\u22650 with residues\ngiven by (28). A very promising candidate for such a continuation has been proposed by Dorn and\nOtto [DO] and independently by AL.B. and A.B. Zamolodchikov [ZZ]. A possible starting point for\nfinding their proposal may be the observation that the known result for s \u2208 Z\u22650 has an interesting\nrecursive structure w.r.t. shifts of one of the arguments by an amount of b:\n\nC(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 + b)\n=\nC(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 )\n(31)\n\u03b3(\u2212b2 )\n\u03b3(b(2\u03b11 + b))\u03b3(2b\u03b11 )\u03b3(b(\u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 b))\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03c0\u03bc \u03b3(b(\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 Q))\u03b3(b(\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ))\u03b3(b(\u03b11 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 ))\nP3\nThe functional relation (31) is a priori only known for \u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 subject to the constraint i=1 \u03b1i =\nQ \u2212 sb for some s \u2208 Z\u22650 . However, it seems to be a natural guess that this recursive relation may\neven be valid for general values of \u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 . One may then easily convince oneself that a solution\nto (31) can be assembled if one was given as building block a function called \u03a5(x) that satisfies the\nfunctional equation (11) of the \u03a5-function introduced in (10).\nThese facts alone can hardly be considered as strong motivation for considering the DOZZproposal as a promising candidate for the three point function of exponential fields in Liouville\ntheory. One should therefore emphasize that this formula has passed a couple of rather nontrivial\nchecks: For example, it was shown to imply a quantum version of the Liouville equation of motion in [DO] (see also our discussion in Part II). The checks performed in [ZZ] include comparison\nwith semiclassical calculations in two different limiting regimes, comparison with results from the\nthermodynamic Bethe ansatz for the sinh-Gordon model (which is related to Liouville theory in the\nultraviolet limit), as well as a numerical check of crossing symmetry for the four-point functions\nconstructed from the three point functions via factorization.\n\n\f-133.6. Duality b \u2192 b\u22121\nThe expression (9) has (at least) one amazing feature: It is left invariant if one replaces b \u2192 b\u0303 \u2261\nb\u22121 and furthermore\n\u0001b\u22122\n(32)\n.\n\u03bc \u2192 \u03bc\u0303 where \u03bc\u0303 is defined by \u03c0 \u03bc\u0303\u03b3(b\u03032 ) = \u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(b2 )\n\nRemembering that b2 was playing the role of a coupling constant or alternatively the role of ~, this\nindicates a rather remarkable and profound self-duality of Liouville theory.\nBut it also raises a puzzle: The expression (9) has more poles than expected on the basis of our\nprevious discussion in Subsection 3.3. Poles occur if\n(33)\n\nQ \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 = nb + mb\u22121 ,\n\nn, m \u2208 Z\u22650\n\nand all cases obtained by the reflections \u03b1i \u2192 Q\u2212\u03b1i , i = 1, 2, 3 from (33). Is there a way to explain\nthese poles from the path-integral point of view? According to our arguments in Subsection 3.3 one\nhas a relation between the asymptotic behavior of the path integral measure [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 for \u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nand the poles of the three point function. The additional poles in (33) should therefore be attributed\nto a modification of the asymptotic expansion (22). In fact, if one replaces the right hand side of (22)\nby\n\u0012Z\n\u0013n \u0012Z\n\u0013m\n\u22121\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212\u03bc)n (\u2212\u03bc\u0303)m e2(bn+b m)\u03c60\n2\n2b\u03c6\u0304\n2 \u2032 2b\u0303\u03c6\u0304\nd ze\n(34)\n,\nd z e\n[D\u03c6\u0304]F,Q\nm!n!\nm,n=0\nand continues as in subsections 3.3 and 3.4, one would find additional poles at (33) with residues\nrepresented by the Dotsenko-Fateev integrals [DF2]\nZ\nZ\n(\u2212\u03bc)n (\u2212\u03bc\u0303)m\n2\n2\n(z\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nz\n)\n=\nG\u03b1n,m\nd\nt\n.\n.\n.\nd\nt\nd2 sm . . . d2 s1\nn\n1\nn\n1\nn ,... ,\u03b11\nm!n!\nC\nC\n(35)\nm\nn\n3\nY\nY\nY\n: e2b\u0303\u03c6(sk ) : |0iF,Q .\n: e2b\u03c6(tj ) :\n: e2\u03b1i \u03c6(zi ) :\nh0|\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\nk=1\n\nAnd indeed, the residues of the proposal (33) coincide precisely with the result of the explicit evaluation of (35) performed in [DF2]. This was observed in [DO][ZZ], and elaborated upon in [OPS1].\nIt seems natural to interpret the modification (34) as describing a quantum correction to the path\nR\n\u22121\nintegral measure that could be described by adding a second interaction term \u03bc\u0303 d2 ze2b \u03c6 to the\naction. Such a modification is compatible with conformal invariance due to the fact [DF1] that the\n\u22121\nnormal ordered exponential : e2b \u03c6 : transforms under conformal transformations the same way\nas : e2b\u03c6 :, namely as (1, 1)-tensor field. The modified action is clearly self-dual under b \u2192 b\u22121 ,\n\u03bc \u2192 \u03bc\u0303.\n3.7. Measure in the bulk of \u03c60 -space?\nIt has become clear that the appearance of poles in the dependence of vacuum expectation values\nin their dependence w.r.t. the parameters \u03b1N , . . . , \u03b11 and the explicit form of the corresponding\nresidues are entirely explained in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the path-integral measure for\nzero mode \u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The free-field vacuum expectation values that represent the residues may be\n\n\f-14called \"resonant amplitudes\" following [DK]. Are there any hints concerning the definition of the\npath-integral for the \"non-resonant\" amplitudes?\nThe following observation from [OPS2] is intriguing: Let us tentatively assume that the measure\nd\u03c60 [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 is of the form\nd\u03c60 [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 = d\u03c60 [D\u03c6\u0304]\u2032 e\u2212\n\n(36)\n\nR\n\nd2 z(\u03bce2b\u03c6(z) +\u03bc\u0303e2b\u0303\u03c6(z) )\n\n,\n\nwhere [D\u03c6\u0304]\u2032 is independent of \u03c60 . In order to reproduce the scaling behavior (21), we will require\nit to be \u03bc-independent as well 1 . [D\u03c6\u0304]\u2032 must then coincide with [D\u03c6\u0304]F,Q for d\u03c60 [D\u03c6\u0304]\u03bc,\u03c60 to have\nasymptotics given by (34). One may then rewrite the condition of translation invariance of the \u03c60 R\u221e\nmeasure, 0 = \u2212\u221e d\u03c60 \u2202\u03c60 , as a relation between vacuum expectation values with different numbers\nof operator insertions:\n!\n!\nZ\nZ\nN\nN\nY\nY\n\u22121\n2\n2\nV\u03b1i (zi , z\u0304i ) =\nV\u03b1i (zi , z\u0304i ) +2b \u03bc\u0303 d z \u03a9 Vb\u22121 (z, z\u0304)\n2b\u03bc d z \u03a9 Vb (z, z\u0304)\n(37)\n\ni=1\n\nC\n\n= \u22122\n\n\u0012X\nN\ni=1\n\nC\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\u0013\nN\nY\n\u03b1i \u2212 Q \u03a9\nV\u03b1i (zi , z\u0304i ) .\ni=1\n\nThis condition can be evaluated more explicitly in the case N=2 [OPS2]. One gets a relation between\nC(b, \u03b1, \u03b1), C(b\u22121 , \u03b1, \u03b1) and the two-point function\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(38) \u03a9 V\u03b12 (z2 , z\u03042 )V\u03b11 (z1 , z\u03041 ) = 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03b12 + \u03b11 \u2212 Q) + S(\u03b1)\u03b4(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ) |z2 \u2212 z1 |\u22124\u2206\u03b11 ,\n\nwhich was observed to be fulfilled by the DOZZ-proposal in [OPS2].2 The objects that appear in\n(38) are not expected to be determined by the (\u03c60 \u2192 \u2212\u221e)-asymptotics of the measure alone. The\nfact that the DOZZ-proposal satisfies the condition in the case N = 2 may therefore be taken as a\nhint that (36) is correct, i.e. that there are no further corrections to the measure besides adding the\nR\n\u22121\ndual interaction \u03bc\u0303 d2 ze2b \u03c6 .\nNevertheless it is not clear to us what conclusion to draw from these observations. First, it is not\nclear whether one should expect the \"sum-rule\" (37) to be valid in general. The case N = 2 for\nwhich consistency with the DOZZ-proposal was verified is still somewhat special. Moreover, one\nshould observe that the compatibility of the DOZZ-proposal with a literal interpretation of (36) is\nnot obvious: The former seems to imply that \u03bc\u0303 as given in (32) can become negative for certain\nvalues of b. But this would imply trouble with the upper limit of the integration over \u03c60 !\nWe will come back to this problem from a different point of view in Part II.\n\n4. RECONSTRUCTION\n\nFor rational conformal field theories it is well-known that the two- and three point functions of\nthe set {V\u0131 ; \u0131 \u2208 I} of all primary fields suffices to reconstruct the Hilbert-space H of the theory and\nR\n\u22121\nthat the inclusion of the \"dual interaction\" \u03bc\u0303 d2 ze2b \u03c6 preserves the scaling (21) if \u03bc\u0303 and \u03bc are related by (32)\nfact, it is argued in [OPS2] that the DOZZ-proposal is the unique expression that satisfies (37) and has residues given\nby the Dotsenko-Fateev integrals (35). We did not understand the assumptions underlying the uniqueness argument of [OPS2]\nwell enough to include a discussion here.\n1 Note\n2 In\n\n\f-15to fully characterize the operators V\u0131 that correspond to the fields V\u0131 . One may therefore suspect\nthat really all that one might want to know about Liouville theory can (at least in principle) be\nextracted from the DOZZ formula and conformal invariance. In the present section we will discuss an\nadaption of the reconstruction procedure from rational conformal field theories to Liouville theory.\nThe DOZZ-proposal will be found to encode the spectrum of Liouville theory in a natural way.\nMoreover, the identification between three point functions of fields V\u03b1 and matrix elements of the\ncorresponding operators V\u03b1 will be found to work straightforwardly for \u03b1 with Q > R(\u03b1) > 0.\nHowever, subtleties that are unfamiliar from rational conformal field theories arise due to the fact\nthat the SL(2, C)-invariant state |0i is not found in the spectrum. Furthermore, the description of\nthe operators V\u03b1 in terms of matrix elements turns out to be more subtle in the cases where R(\u03b1) is\nnot in (0, Q).\nWe believe the following considerations to be important for understanding how particular features\nof the DOZZ-formula (like analyticity, pole structure, values of residues) are crucial for the success\nof such a reconstruction procedure.\n4.1. Reconstruction of rational conformal field theories\nConsider a rational conformal field theory C with set PC \u2261 {V\u0131 ; \u0131 \u2208 I} of all primary fields. Let\nus assume for simplicity that left- and right conformal dimensions of the primary field V\u0131 coincide:\n \u0304 \u0131 . It is often convenient to assume that PC includes the identity corresponding to the label\n\u2206\u0131 = \u2206\n\u0131 = 0. Assume furthermore to be given the set of all three-point functions of the form\n\u0001\n(39)\n\u03a9 V\u01313 (z3 ) . . . V\u01311 (z1 ) = |z32 |2\u220632 |z31 |2\u220631 |z21 |2\u220621 C(\u01313 , \u01312 , \u01311 ),\n\nwhere C(\u01313 , \u01312 , \u01311 ) are real numbers. The two-point functions are obtained by setting any of \u01313 , \u01312 , \u01311\nto 0. The conformal Ward identities allow one to recover two- and three point functions of all descendants V\u0131 (\u03b6|z), \u03b6 \u2208 R\u2206\u0131 \u2297 R\u2206\u0131 from the data (39), where R\u2206 denotes the irreducible representation\nof the Virasoro algebra with highest weight \u2206.

Preliminaries\nTo prepare for our discussion of the reconstruction procedure in the case of Liouville theory let us\nmake two observations concerning the DOZZ formula:\nFirst, it satisfies reflection relations such as\n(47)\n\nC(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) = S(\u03b13 )C(Q \u2212 \u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ),\n\nwhere the the reflection amplitude S(\u03b1) is given as\n\u0001b\u22121 (Q\u22122\u03b1)\n\u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(b2 )\n\u03b3(2b\u03b1 \u2212 b2 )\nS(\u03b1) =\n(48)\n.\nb2\n\u03b3(2 \u2212 2b\u22121 \u03b1 + b\u22122 )\nBy symmetry of C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) one finds the corresponding relations for the other arguments. This\nallows one to restrict attention to values of the variables \u03b1i , i = 1, 2, 3 that satisfy the so-called\nSeiberg-bound [Se]:\n(49)\n\nR(\u03b1i ) \u2264\n\nQ\n2,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3.\n\nSecond, let us observe that the DOZZ-formula is indeed analytic as long as the condition for\nconvergence of the zero mode integration in the path-integral is satisfied, namely\n(50)\n\n\u2212bR(s) = R(\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 ) \u2212 Q > 0,\n\nbut has singularities otherwise. This suggests that an interpretation of the tree point functions as a\nmatrix element,\n\u0001\n(51)\n\u03a9 V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 ) \u2261 h0|V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 )|0i\n\nwill be most straightforward if one starts with the range given by (50). Taking into account (49) one\nfinds that (50) can only be satisfied if 0 < R(\u03b1i ) \u2264 Q\n2 i = 1, 2, 3.\n\n\f-174.3. Two-point function?\nSo can we define states |\u03b1iin , out h\u03b1| that are created via\n(52)\n\n|\u03b1iin \u2261 lim V\u03b1 (z)|0i,\n\nout h\u03b1|\n\nz\u21920\n\n\u2261 lim |z|4\u2206\u03b1 h0|V\u03b1 (z) ?\nz\u2192\u221e\n\nWhen trying to adapt the reconstruction procedure from rational conformal field theories to the\npresent case, the first question to address is: What is the unit field, or equivalently: How to recover\nthe two-point functions from C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 )? The unit field should clearly have vanishing conformal\ndimension \u2206\u03b1 = \u03b1(Q \u2212 \u03b1). Under the restriction (49) this is only found for \u03b1 = 0 which lies on the\nboundary of our \"allowed\" region 0 < R(\u03b1i ) \u2264 Q\n2 . So let us consider the behavior of C(\u03b12 , \u01eb, \u03b11 )\nfor small |\u01eb| with R(\u01eb) > 0: It is given as\n(53) C(\u03b12 , \u01eb, \u03b11 ) \u2243\n\n2\u01eb\n2\u01ebS(\u03b11 )\n+\n,\n(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 + \u01eb)(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 + \u01eb) (Q \u2212 \u03b12 + \u03b11 + \u01eb)(\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 Q + \u01eb)\n\nwhere S(\u03b1) is the reflection amplitude introduced above. C(\u03b12 , \u01eb, \u03b11 ) vanishes for \u01eb \u2192 0 unless\n\u03b12 = \u03b11 or \u03b12 = Q \u2212 \u03b11 and becomes infinite otherwise. The two-point function can therefore\nonly be defined in the distributional sense. To actually define it as a distribution from (53) one needs\nto specify a contour over which \u03b12 , \u03b11 are supposed to be integrated. One clearly can only get\ndistributions proportional to delta-distributions, but the precise pre-factors depend on the direction\nfrom which \u01eb approaches zero.\nThe distributional character of the two-point function is of course just what was to be expected\nwhen having continuous sets of primary fields, since the vanishing of the two-point function for\n\u03b12 6= \u03b11 and \u03b12 6= Q \u2212 \u03b11 is required by conformal invariance. This also implies that we can\nnot hope to find any state that is normalizable in the strict sense, but only normalizability in the\ndistributional sense.\n4.4. Scalar product\nLet us therefore ask for which values of \u03b1 it is possible to define a reasonable scalar product from\nthe two-point function. To this aim we need to know the hermiticity properties of V\u03b1 : It follows\nfrom (C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ))\u2217 = C(\u03b1\u22173 , \u03b1\u22172 , \u03b1\u22171 ) that V\u03b1 behaves as follows under hermitian conjugation:\n\u0001\u2020\n(54)\nV\u03b1 (z) = |z|\u22124\u2206(\u03b1) V\u03b1\u2217 z\u0304 \u22121 ).\nWe should therefore obtain the scalar product from the three-point function as\n\n(55)\n\nin h\u03b12 |\u03b11 iin\n\n= lim C(\u03b1\u22172 , \u03b1, \u03b11 ).\n\u03b1\u21920\n\nAs the right hand side vanishes unless \u03b1\u22172 = \u03b11 or \u03b1\u22172 = Q \u2212 \u03b11 , it is easy to see that no reasonable\nscalar product can be obtained unless either \u03b1i \u2208 R or \u03b1i \u2208 Q\n2 + iR. This would also follow\nwhen considering the extension of the scalar product (55) to states generated from descendants: The\nrepresentations V\u03b1i are unitary only if \u03b1i \u2208 R or \u03b1i \u2208 Q\n2 + iR.\nIn the first case one would need to choose in (53) an \u01eb with I(\u01eb) 6= 0, which would lead to\n(56)\n\nin h\u03b12 |\u03b11 iin\n\n= \u00b12\u03c0iS(\u03b11 )\u03b4(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ).\n\nDue to the unavoidable factor of i in (56) one does not get a reasonable scalar product for |\u03b1i with\n\u03b1 \u2208 R.\n\n\f-18The other case \u03b1i = Q\n2 + iPi , Pi \u2208 R is better: The reflection property (47) allows one to restrict\nto Pi > 0. One then needs to choose \u01eb with R(\u01eb) > 0, in which case (53) gives\nQ\nin h 2\n\n(57)\n\n+ iP2 | Q\n2 + iP1 iin = 2\u03c0\u03b4(P2 \u2212 P1 ).\n\nLet us identify |P i \u2261 | Q\n2 + iP1 iin . It is straightforward to generalize the discussion to states |P, \u03b6i,\n\u03b6 \u2208 WP \u2261 W Q +iP that are created by the vertex operators V Q +iP : The scalar product is then\n2\n2\ngiven as\nhP \u2032 , \u03b62 |P, \u03b61 i = 2\u03c0\u03b4(P \u2032 \u2212 P )(\u03b62 , \u03b61 )WP ,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere (\u03b62 , \u03b61 )WP denotes the scalar product in WP that is normalized such that (vP , vP )WP = 1 if\nvP is the highest weight vector in WP .\nWe conclude that conformal symmetry and DOZZ-formula imply that the Liouville Hilbert space\ntakes the form\nZ\u2295\ndP\n(59)\nWP .\nH \u2243\n2\u03c0\nR+\n\nR EMARK 2. - Let us note that a calculation like (44) now implies that\n|P, \u03b6\u0304iout = | \u2212 P, \u03b6iin = R(\u2212P )|P, \u03b6iin ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere R(\u2212P ) \u2261 S( Q\n2 \u2212 iP ) is the reflection amplitude encountered earlier. But this means that\nthe scattering operator S that relates in- and out states is diagonal in the basis {|P, \u03b6i; P \u2208 R+ , \u03b6 \u2208\nWP } and given by multiplication with R(\u2212P ). The unitarity of S follows from |R(p)|2 = 1. We\nwill see later that S indeed has an interpretation as a scattering operator that describes the scattering\nof wave-packets off the Liouville potential.\n4.5. Matrix elements\nHaving identified the set of normalizable states, we may then recover the matrix elements of\noperators V\u03b1 , with \u03b1 in the range 0 < R(\u03b1) \u2264 Q\n2 identified in subsection (4.2), as follows:\nhP3 , \u03b63 |V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 , \u03b61 i \u2261\n(61)\n\n \u0304\n2\u2206(\u03b63 ) 2\u2206(\u03b6\n)\nz\u03043 3 \u03a9\n\n\u2261 lim lim z3\nz1 \u21920 z3 \u2192\u221e\n\n\u0001\nV\u1fb13 (\u03b63 |z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (\u03b61 |z1 ) .\n\nQ\nWe use the notation \u03b1i = Q\n2 + iPi , \u1fb1i \u2261 Q \u2212 \u03b1i = 2 \u2212 iPi , i = 1, 2, . . . . Knowing the matrix\nelements of the operators V\u03b1 should of course allow one to represent the matrix elements of products\nof these operators by summing over intermediate states: Let BP be a basis for WP , which may be\nchosen to consist of vectors \u03b6 \u2208 WP that diagonalize L0 , L\u03040 . Each element \u03b6 \u2208 BP has a unique\n\"dual\" \u03b6 t which is the vector defined by the property (\u03b6 t , \u03b6 \u2032 )WP = \u03b4\u03b6,\u03b6 \u2032 for all \u03b6 \u2032 \u2208 BP . An example\nfor the representation of matrix elements by summing over intermediate states can then be written\nas follows:\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i \u2261\nZ\ndP X\n(62)\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )|P, \u03b6ihP, \u03b6 t |V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i,\n\u2261\nR+ 2\u03c0\n\u03b6\u2208BP\n\n\f-19We may furthermore assume that the elements of BP factorize as \u03b6 = \u03be2 \u2297 \u03be1 . This leads to a\nfactorized representation of the matrix element (62) of the following form:\nZ\n\u0001\nd\u03b1\nC \u1fb14 , \u03b13 , \u03b1)C \u1fb1, \u03b12 , \u03b11 \u00d7\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i \u2261\n(63)\nS 2\u03c0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002 3 \u03b12 \u0003\ns \u03b13 \u03b12\n\u00d7F\u03b1s \u03b1\n\u03b14 \u03b11 (z3 , z2 )F\u03b1 \u03b14 \u03b11 (z\u03043 , z\u03042 ),\n\nwhere the variable \u03b1 was introduced by \u03b1 = Q\nthe integral over P \u2208 R+ becomes an\n2 +iP , such that\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\ns \u03b13 \u03b12\nintegral over \u03b1 \u2208 S \u2261 Q\n2 + iR . The conformal blocks F\u03b1 \u03b14 \u03b11 (z3 , z2 ) are given by the following\npower series:\n(64)\n\nF\u03b1s\n\n\u0002\u03b13 \u03b12 \u0003\n\u03b14 \u03b11\n\n\u2206\u03b14 \u2212\u2206\u03b1 \u2212\u2206\u03b13 \u2206\u03b1 \u2212\u2206\u03b12 \u2212\u2206\u03b11\nz2\n\n(z3 , z2 ) = z3\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\nz2 \u0011n s \u0002\u03b13 \u03b12 \u0003\nF\u03b1 \u03b14 \u03b11 (n).\nz3\nn=0\n\n\u0002 \u03b1 \u0003\n3 2\nThe coefficients F\u03b1s \u03b1\n\u03b14 \u03b11 (n) are given by sums over vectors \u03be \u2208 V\u03b1 with fixed eigenvalues \u2206\u03b1 +n.\nSome more information concerning the definition of the conformal blocks can be found in Subsection\n7.1. Here let us only note that the series that represent F\u03b1 actually converge for |z2 | < |z3 |.\n\n4.6. Meromorphic continuation of matrix elements\nIt will be important in the following to note that the matrix elements such as (62) admit a meromorphic continuation to arbitrary complex values of P4 , P1 , \u03b13 , \u03b12 . For notational convenience let\nus identify |\u03b1i \u2261 |P i if \u03b1 and P are related by \u03b1 = Q\n2 + iP . We will consider the example of\nh\u03b14 |V\u03b13 (w)V\u03b12 (z)|\u03b11 i. It is shown in Section 7 below that this matrix element has a meromorphic\ncontinuation w.r.t. all four variables \u03b14 , . . . , \u03b11 with poles if and only if\n(65)\n\nQ+\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\nsi \u03b1i \u2212\n\nQ\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n= \u2212nb \u2212 mb\u22121 ,\n\nsi \u2208 {1, \u22121}.\n\nThe poles with si = 1 i = 1, . . . , 4 are in precise correspondence with the singularities that one\nwould expect on the basis of the path-integral arguments discussed in section 3. All others are\ngenerated by reflection relations like (47).\nThis meromorphic continuation can be represented as in (62) as long as the conditions\n(66)\n\n|R(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )| < Q/2;\n\n|R(Q \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )| < Q/2;\n\n|R(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 )| < Q/2;\n\n|R(Q \u2212 \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 )| < Q/2,\n\nare satisfied. Otherwise one has a representation of the form\n\n(67)\n\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i \u2261\nZ\n1\ndP X\n\u2261\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )|P, \u03b6ihP, \u03b6 t |V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i,\n2 C 2\u03c0\n\u03b6\u2208BP\n\nwhere the contour C can generically be taken as R plus a finite sum of small circles around certain\npoles of the three-point functions that appear in (62).\n\n\f-204.7. Normalizable vs. non-normalizable states\nOur identification of the set of normalizable states seems to create puzzles: For example, the states\n|P i have conformal dimensions larger than Q2 /4, so one does not find the state |0i among them.\nBut if |0i is not in the spectrum, what meaning does the state-operator correspondence have?\nTo start with, let us recall that |P i \u2208\n/ H. This means in particular that scalar products such as\nhP |\u03c8i will not be defined for all |\u03c8i \u2208 H (square-integrability only requires hP |\u03c8i to be defined\nup to P from a set of measure zero). One needs to consider subspaces T \u2282 H which are such that\nhP |\u03c8i is defined for any |\u03c8i \u2208 T . |P i is then interpreted as an element of the hermitian dual T \u2020\nof T , the space of all anti-linear forms on T . The triple of spaces T \u2282 H \u2282 T \u2020 is often called a\n\"Gelfand triple\". Let us remark that for elements of the spectrum, |P i with P \u2208 R+ , it does not\nmatter which subspace T \u2282 H one chooses.\nBut one may also consider particularly \"nice\" subspaces T which are such that the wave-function\n\u03c8(P ) \u2261 hP |\u03c8i admits an analytic continuation into some region R \u2282 C around R+ . On such a\nsubspace one may of course consider the forms |P i to be defined by h\u03c8|P i \u2261 (\u03c8(P ))\u2217 for any\ncomplex P \u2208 R. So let us try to see whether such a distributional interpretation of the states |P i for\nP \u2208 C is useful in the present context.\nThe matrix element hP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|P1 i, R(\u03b1) > 0, |z| < 1, can be interpreted as the wave-function\nof the state P0 V\u03b1 (z)|P1 i, where P0 denotes the projection onto the subspace H0 \u2282 H of vectors\nthat satisfy Ln |\u03c8i = 0 = L\u0304n |\u03c8i. The very existence of that wave-function means that the operator\nV\u03b1 (z) must act smoothing on states |\u03c8i: It creates a state with smooth wave-function when acting\non the distribution |P1 i, which would have a delta-distribution as \"wave-function\". For R(\u03b1) > 0,\nthe wave-function hP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|P1 i is not only smooth w.r.t. P2 , but even analytic within the strip\n{P2 \u2208 C; |I(P2 )| < R(\u03b1)}, as follows from the DOZZ formula. The distributional interpretation\nof the states |P i with P \u2208\n/ R is therefore very natural in this context.\nHowever, if the |P i are to be interpreted in a distributional sense both for P \u2208 R and P \u2208\n/\nR, why can't the |P i with P \u2208\n/ R appear in the spectrum? It can be shown on rather general\nfunctional analytic grounds that a state such as |P i can appear in a spectral decomposition only if\nthe distribution hP | is defined on any space T \u2282 H of test functions that allows the wave-functions\nhP |\u03c8i to be pointwise defined for any \u03c8 \u2208 T , not only up to a set of measure zero 3 . This is clearly\nnot the case for the |P i with P \u2208\n/ R: The condition of analyticity in some strip that determines the\ndomain of hP | is much too strong. A related fact is that \"scalar products\" like hP \u2032 |P i can be defined\nin the distributional sense as long as P, P \u2032 \u2208 R, but do not have a canonical definition as soon as P\nor P \u2032 have non-vanishing imaginary part.\n4.8. The vacuum |0i\nLet us now check that the distributional interpretation of |P i for complex P yields a self-consistent\nunderstanding of the SL(2, C) -invariant \"state\" |0i. To this aim we need to check if (i) the state\nV\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i is in the domain of h0|, and (ii) The value of h0|V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i is given\nby\n\u0001\n(68)\nh0|V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i = lim \u03a9 V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 ) ,\nz1 \u21920\n\n3 For\n\na more precise mathematical discussion and proofs see e.g. the introduction and first section of [Be].\n\n\f-21where \u03b11 = Q\n2 + iP1 .\nSo let us consider hP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i, the wave-function of the state P0 V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i.\nIt follows from our observation in Subsection 4.6 that hP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i is analytic w.r.t.\nP4 in a strip of width R(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ). So if R(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) > Q\n2 one indeed finds that the state\nP0 V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i is in the domain of h0| \u2261 hP |P =\u2212i Q .\n2\nIn order to determine its value, one needs to return to the representation (62) for\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i. When continuing P4 to \u2212i Q\n2 one necessarily leaves the range (66), so\nthat the more general representation of the form (67) has to be used. The residual terms include the\nQ\ncontribution from the pole of hP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )|P, \u03b6i at Q\n2 \u2212 iP4 = \u03b13 + 2 \u0001+ iP , which yields a contribution that can be identified with limz1 \u21920 \u03a9 V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 ) . All other contributions are\nfound to vanish due to the zero of C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) at \u03b13 = 0.\nSo for R(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) > Q\n2 , the smoothing effect of V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 ) is strong enough to map\n|P1 i into the domain of h0|. This discussion is easily generalized to the case where R(\u03b11 ) 6= Q\n2,\n\u03b11 = Q\n(z\n)|\u03b1\ni\nwill\nbe\nin\nthe\ndomain\nof\nh0|\nif\nR(\u03b1\n+\u03b1\n+\u03b1\n)\n>\nQ.\nMoreover,\n(z\n)V\n+iP\n:\nV\n2\n1\n1\n2\n3\n3\n\u03b1\n1\n\u03b1\n2\n3\n2\nby a very similar reasoning one would find that the smoothing effect of V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 ) is\nstrong enough to map |0i into the domain of h0|. We have thereby obtained the precise meaning of\nthe relation\n\u0001\n(69)\n\u03a9 V\u03b13 (\u03b63 |z3 )V\u03b12 (\u03b62 |z2 )V\u03b11 (\u03b62 |z1 ) \u2261 h0|V\u03b13 (\u03b63 |z3 )V\u03b12 (\u03b62 |z2 )V\u03b11 (\u03b61 |z1 )|0i.\n\nIt is straightforward to interpret vacuum expectation values of more than three operators along these\nlines. Let us note that the condition for h0| to be in the domain of the state created by acting with\nQn\ni=1 V\u03b1i (zi ) on |0i is precisely the condition for convergence of zero mode integration found in\nSubsection 3.3.\n4.9. Operators V\u03b1 with R(\u03b1) \u2264 0\n\nSo far we had only discussed the connection between fields V\u03b1 and operators V\u03b1 for 0 \u2264 R(\u03b1) \u2264\nLet us now generalize to R(\u03b1) \u2264 0.\nThe main point is best seen when considering the wave-function hP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|\u03c8i of the state created\nR\u221e\n1\nby acting with P0 V\u03b1 (z) on a state |\u03c8i of the form |\u03c8i = 2\u03c0\n0 dP1 \u03c8(P1 )|P1 i. It is clearly wellQ\ndefined as long as 0 < R(\u03b1) \u2264 2 and given by\nZ\ndP1\nhP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|\u03c8i =\n(70)\n\u03c8(P1 ) hP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|P1 i.\n2\u03c0\n+\nR\nQ\n2.\n\nWhen R(\u03b1) \u2192 0, it will generically cease to be defined due to the poles of hP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|P1 i at\nQ\nQ\n2 \u00b1 iP2 = \u03b1 + 2 \u00b1 iP1 . One may, however, consider states |\u03c8i whose wave-functions \u03c8(P ) admit\nan analytic continuation into a strip of width w. For such |\u03c8i it is possible to analytically continue\nthe expression (70) to all \u03b1 with \u2212w < R(\u03b1) \u2264 0: This is done by first using the reflection property\n|P i = R(P )| \u2212 P i to extend the integration over R+ to an integral over R, and then deforming\nthe contour of integration over P1 suitably around the poles of hP2 |V\u03b1 (z)|P1 i that cross the axis R\nwhen R(\u03b1) becomes negative. We conclude that V\u03b1 (z) for R(\u03b1) \u2264 0 makes sense as an unbounded\noperator with domain restricted to states with wave-functions analytic in strips of width larger or\nequal to |R(\u03b1)|.\n\n\f-22The following alternative point of view is useful: Consider P0 V\u03b12 (z1 )|P1 i, which for 0 <\nR(\u03b1) \u2264 Q\n2 can be represented as\nZ\n1\ndP\n(71)\n|P ihP |V\u03b12 (z1 )|P1 i.\nP0 V\u03b12 (z1 )|P1 i =\n2 R 2\u03c0\nQ\nThe matrix element hP |V\u03b12 (z1 )|P1 i has poles at Q\n2 \u00b1 iP = \u03b12 + 2 \u00b1 iP1 , which approach the\ncontour R of integration in (71) when R(\u03b1) \u2192 0.\nOn a formal level it is straightforward to perform the continuation to R(\u03b1) \u2264 0: We had previously\ndiscussed the continuation of the |P i to complex values of P in the sense of distributions in T \u2020 . In\nthis spirit one would perform the continuation of (71) simply by again deforming the contour of\nintegration over P . This generically yields a representation of the form (71) but with contour R\nreplaced by R plus a finite sum of circles around the poles of hP |V\u03b12 (z1 )|P1 i that have crossed the\ncontour R. For example, if \u2212b < R(\u03b1) \u2264 0 one would get instead of (71) the expression\nZ\ndP\n1\n(72)\n|P ihP |V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i,\nP0 V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i = |P1 \u2212 i\u03b12 i +\n2 R 2\u03c0\n\nwhere the value of the residues has been worked out from the DOZZ-formula taking into account\nthe reflection property (47). Formula (72) clearly makes sense as an equation in T \u2020 if T is such\nthat the wave-functions hP |\u03c8i of |\u03c8i \u2208 T are analytic in a strip of width larger than |R(\u03b12 )|. The\nunboundedness of V\u03b12 (z2 ) for R(\u03b12 ) \u2264 0 is now reflected in the appearance of non-normalizable\nstates such as e.g. the state |P1 \u2212 i\u03b12 i in (72).\n4.10. Null vector decoupling\nSomething interesting happens if one considers V\u03b1 (z) for 2\u03b1 = 2\u03b1m,n \u2261 \u2212mb \u2212 nb\u22121 ,\nn, m \u2208 Z\u22650 , where the Verma module V\u03b1 contains a singular vector sn,m . The matrix element\nhP3 |V\u03b12 (z)|P1 i is proportional to \u03a5(2\u03b12 ), which vanishes for \u03b12 = \u03b1m,n . This means that the\nexpansion (72) of P0 V\u03b12 (z)|P1 i over states |P i does not contain the part represented as an integral\nover R. What is non-vanishing, however, are the residue terms that were picked up in the process of\ndefining the analytic continuation. These are found to be given by an expression of the form\n(73)\n\nP0 V\u03b1 (z)|P i =\n\nm X\nn\nX\n\nm,n\nCr,s\n(P ) |P \u2212 i(\u03b1 + rb + sb\u22121 )i.\n\nr=0 s=0\n\nThe values of P \u2212 i(\u03b1 + rb + sb\u22121) that appear in (73) are in precise correspondence to the so-called\nfusion rules for decoupling of the null vector in the representation V\u03b12 : It follows from a theorem of\nFeigin and Fuchs [FF], which is quoted below in Section 6 as Theorem 1, that\n(74)\n\nV\u03b1 (sn,m \u2297 vn,m |z) = 0,\n\nV\u03b1 (vn,m \u2297 sn,m |z) = 0,\n\nif vn,m and sn,m are the highest weight and the singular vectors of the Verma module V\u03b1m,n respectively. Vacuum expectation values that contain these fields will satisfy differential equations of the\ntype discussed in [BPZ].\nWe find it remarkable to see how deep information on the representation theory of the Virasoro\nalgebra is encoded in the analytic structure of the DOZZ three point function.\n\n\f-23R EMARK 3. - A special case of this result reproduces the identification of the identity operator as\nthe primary field with vanishing conformal dimension:\nlim V\u03b1 (z) = id,\n\n(75)\n\n\u03b1\u21920\n\nwhich may be seen as an example of null vector decoupling in the case n = 0 = m.\n\n5. LOCALITY AND CROSSING SYMMETRY?\nA major issue of consistency arises: If follows from the preceding discussions that vacuum expecQ\ntation values such as h0| ni V\u03b1i (zi )|0i are uniquely given by conformal symmetry and the DOZZ\nformula: Summing over intermediate states as in (62) produces power series with coefficients that\ncan all be expressed in terms of the matrix elements hP3 , \u03b63 |V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 , \u03b61 i, which characterize the\noperators V\u03b1 uniquely. But are the operators that are characterized in such a way also local, i.e. do\nthey satisfy V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 ) = V\u03b11 (z1 )V\u03b12 (z2 )?\nIt clearly suffices to consider the case of n = 4 which corresponds to the matrix element\nhP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i. In view of the power series expansions for this matrix element discussed\nin Subsection 4.5 one sees that this question involves the following issues: First, it was stated there\nthat the power series that represent hP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i and hP4 |V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b13 (z3 )|P1 i are convergent for |z2 | < |z3 | and |z3 | < |z2 | respectively. In order for the question of locality to have any\nsense, one evidently needs that the conformal blocks can be analytically continued into |z2 | > |z3 |\nand |z3 | > |z2 | respectively. Given that such an analytic continuation exists, locality amounts to a\nhighly nontrivial identity between the conformal blocks, which are fully given by conformal symme\u0001\ntry, and the coefficients C \u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 that represent the measure with which the conformal blocks\nare weighted in (63).\nBy now we believe to have a proof for this crucial property, which will be sketched in Parts III\nand IV, with details to be presented elsewhere. Until then we will simply assume that the DOZZproposal indeed describes local operators V\u03b1 .\n\n5.1. Crossing symmetry\nLocality is closely related (almost equivalent) to another property of vacuum expectation values\nQn\nh0| i V\u03b1i (zi )|0i that is usually called crossing symmetry. Let us again restrict to the case n = 4,\nwhich is good enough. Inserting a complete set of intermediate states yields an expansion\n(76)\n\nh0|V\u03b14 (z4 )V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 )|0i \u2261\nZ\nd\u03b1 X\nh0|V\u03b14 (z4 )V\u03b13 (z3 )|\u03b1, \u03b6ih\u03b1, \u03b6 t |V\u03b12 (z2 )V\u03b11 (z1 )|0i.\n\u2261\n2\u03c0\nS\n\u03b6\u2208B\u03b1\n\nAlternatively one may use locality to move V\u03b11 to the right of V\u03b14 , and then insert a complete set of\nstates between V\u03b14 V\u03b11 and V\u03b13 V\u03b12 . Noting that V\u03b1 (z)|0i = ezL\u22121 +z\u0304L\u0304\u22121 |\u03b1i one may rewrite the\n\n\f-24resulting expansion as follows:\nh0|V\u03b14 (z4 ) . . .

If one finally uses locality of V\u03b11 (z1 ) and\nV\u03b1 (\u03b6|z2 ) one gets an expansion that can be read as the result of expanding the product of operators\nV\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 ) according to the OPE:\nZ\n\u0001\nd\u03b1 X\n(78)\nV\u03b1 (\u03b6|z2 ) \u03a9 V\u1fb1 (\u03b6 t |\u221e)V\u03b13 (z3 \u2212 z2 )V\u03b12 (0) .\nV\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 ) =\n2\u03c0\nS\n\u03b6\u2208B\u03b1\n\u0001\nThe fact that the power series expansion obtained by inserting (78) into \u03a9 V\u03b14 (z4 ) . . .

Verma modules\nLet V be the infinite dimensional vector space with basis B = {v\u03bd ; \u03bd \u2208 T }, where T is the\nset of all tuples \u03bd = (r1 , . . . , ri , . . . ) with all but finitely many ri being zero. The element of B\nthat corresponds to the tuple with ri \u2261 0 for all i will be denoted v. V is the direct sum of finite\ndimensional vector spaces V[m] with fixed \"level\" m, which are spanned by the vectors v\u03bd with\nP\u221e\nn(\u03bd) = m, where n(\u03bd) = i=0 iri .\nThere is a standard family V\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 C of representations of the Virasoro algebra that can be defined\non V: It is uniquely defined by the requirements that\n(i) Ln v = 0 for n > 0 and L0 v0 = \u2206\u03b1 v, where \u2206\u03b1 = \u03b1(Q \u2212 \u03b1), and\n\n\f-25(ii) v\u03bd =\n\nQ\u221e\n\nri\ni=1 (L\u2212i ) v\n\nif \u03bd = (r1 , . . . , ri , . . . ).\n\nThe representation V\u03b1 depends of course on the conformal dimension \u2206\u03b1 only4 , so V\u03b1 \u2261 VQ\u2212\u03b1 .\nThere is a standard bilinear form h., .i\u03b1 on V which is defined by hv, vi\u03b1 = 1 and hL\u2212n \u03be, \u03b6i\u03b1 =\nh\u03be, Ln \u03b6i\u03b1 . The representation V\u03b1 is irreducible if and only if h., .i\u03b1 is non-degenerate. A criterion\nfor the latter is vanishing of the determinant of the matrix with elements B\u03bd\u03bc (\u03b1) = hv\u03bd , v\u03bc i\u03b1 . This\nmatrix is block-diagonal with blocks B\u03bd\u03bc (\u03b1, n) for each subspace V\u03b1 [n] (\u2261 V[n] as a vector space).\nThe formula for the determinant Dn (\u03b1) of the matrix B\u03bd\u03bc (\u03b1, n) was conjectured in [K1] and proven\nin [FF]. It may be written as\nDn (\u03b1) = C\n(81)\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n(\u2206\u03b1 \u2212 \u2206r,s )p(n\u2212rs) , where\n\nr,s=0\n\n\u2206r,s = \u03b1r,s (Q \u2212 \u03b1r,s ),\n\n\u03b1r,s = \u2212 2b r \u2212\n\n1\n2b s,\n\nwhere C is a constant independent of \u03b1, c, and p(n) denotes the dimension of V[n].\nWith the help of the determinant formula (81) it is possible to determine the cases where one has\na scalar product (., .)\u03b1 on V\u03b1 such that (L\u2212n \u03be, \u03b6)\u03b1 = (\u03be, Ln \u03b6)\u03b1 (unitarity). We are interested in the\ncase c > 1, in which the necessary and sufficient condition for unitarity of the representation V\u03b1 was\nfound to be \u2206\u03b1 > 0 [K2].\nt\nthat are\nIf \u03b1 6= \u03b1r,s one has a unique basis B\u03b1t that is dual to B w.r.t. h., .i\u03b1 : It has elements v\u03b1,\u03bd\nt\nt\ndefined by hv\u03b1,\u03bc , v\u03bd i\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03bc,\u03bd . The expansion of the vectors v\u03b1,\u03bd w.r.t. the canonical basis for V can\nbe written in terms of the inverse B \u03bd\u03bc (\u03b1) of the matrix B\u03bd\u03bc (\u03b1):\nX\nt\n(82)\nB \u03bd\u03bc (\u03b1) v\u03bc ,\nv\u03b1,\u03bd\n=\n\u03bc\u2208T (\u03bd)\n\nwhere T (\u03bd) is the set of all tuples \u03bc = (r1 , . . . , ri , . . . ) with n(\u03bc) \u2261 n(\u03bd). It is clear that the\nt\ndependence of the v\u03b1,\u03bd\non \u03b1 is rational with poles at \u03b1 = \u03b1r,s . We will need to know the singular\nbehavior at \u03b1 = \u03b1r,s more precisely.\nTo this aim let us first consider Vr,s \u2261 V\u03b1r,s . Vanishing of the Kac-determinant Dn (\u03b1) for\n\u03b1 = \u03b1r,s . is equivalent to the existence of a subspace Sr,s \u2282 Vr,s that consists of vectors \u03be with\nthe property h\u03be, \u03b6i\u03b1r,s = 0 for all \u03b6 \u2208 Vr,s . The singular subspace Sr,s \u2282 Vr,s is generated from a\nso-called null-vector sr,s \u2208 Vr,s that satisfies the highest weight property Ln sr,s = 0 for n > 0 and\nL0 sr,s = (\u2206r,s + rs)sr,s .\nt\nWe would now like to show that v\u03b1,\u03bd\nhas a pole of first order at \u03b1 = \u03b1r,s and lim\u03b1\u2192\u03b1r,s (\u03b1 \u2212\nt\nt\nis rational there exists\n\u03b1r,s ) v\u03b1,\u03bd \u2208 Sr,s .

APPENDIX B: MEROMORPHIC CONTINUATION OF MATRIX ELEMENTS\n7.1. Analytic properties of conformal blocks\nOur definition of \u03c1 allows us to write the coefficients of the power series (64) that define the\nconformal blocks as follows:\nX\n\u0002 3 \u03b12 \u0003\nF\u03b1s \u03b1\n(86)\n\u03c1\u03b14 ,\u03b13 ,\u03b1 (v, v, v\u03bc ) B \u03bc\u03bd (\u03b1) \u03c1\u03b1,\u03b12 ,\u03b11 (v\u03bd , v, v).\n\u03b14 \u03b11 (n) =\n\u03bc,\u03bd\u2208Tn\n\n\f-27The convergence of the power series (64) for |z2 | < |z3 | can be shown [TO] by means of the\nfree field representation for the chiral vertex operators (cf. Part III, Subsection 15.2 and Part IV,\nSubsection 18.1). This fact yields important information on the dependence of the conformal blocks\nF\u03b1s w.r.t. the variables \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b14 and \u03b1:\nThe conformal blocks F\u03b1s are entire analytic as functions of \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b14 and meromorphic as\nfunction of \u03b1, with poles for \u2206\u03b1 = \u2206r,s . The residues of these poles vanish iff either (\u03b14 , \u03b13 , \u03b1) or\n(\u03b1, \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) satisfy the fusion rules from Theorem 1.\nBy convergence of the power series (64) it suffices to verify the corresponding claims for the\n\u0002 \u03b1 \u0003\n\u03b14 ,\u03b13 ,\u03b1\n3 2\n(v, v, v\u03bc )\u03c1\u03b1,\u03b12 ,\u03b11 (v\u03bd , v, v) is a polynomial in \u03b1\ncoefficients F\u03b1s \u03b1\n\u03b14 \u03b11 (n). The product \u03c1\nand \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b14 . B \u03bc\u03bd (\u03b1) depends rationally on \u03b1 with poles iff \u2206\u03b1 = \u2206r,s . By our observation at\n\u0002 \u03b1 \u0003\n3 2\nthe end of Subsection 6.1 one may express the resulting residues of F\u03b1s \u03b1\n\u03b14 \u03b11 (n) as sum of terms\n\u03b14 ,\u03b13 ,\u03b1\n\u03b1,\u03b12 ,\u03b11\ncontaining either \u03c1\u221e,1,0 (v, v, s) or \u03c1\u221e,1,0 (s, v, v), where s is an element of the singular subspace\nSr,s . The claim concerning vanishing of the residues is therefore a direct consequence of Theorem\n1.\n7.2. Proof of meromorphic continuation of correlation functions\nTo establish the meromorphic continuation of the correlation function hP4 |V\u03b13 (z3 )V\u03b12 (z2 )|P1 i\nlet us first consider the integrand in (62): By the remark at the end of the previous subsection and the\nanalytic properties of the \u03a5-function it takes the form of a product of functions that are meromorphic\nw.r.t. \u03b14 , . . . , \u03b11 and \u03b1. The double poles from the conformal blocks F\u03b1 are cancelled against zeros\nof the factors \u03a5(Q + 2iP ) and \u03a5(Q \u2212 2iP ). One is therefore left with poles coming from the\nDOZZ three point functions. The resulting pattern of poles is as follows: Let us use the variable\n\u03b1\u2261 Q\n2 + iP instead of P . One has strings of poles at\n\u03b1 = \u03c31 (\u03b11 \u2212 Q/2) + \u03c32 (\u03b12 \u2212 Q/2) \u2212 nb \u2212 mb\u22121 ,\n(87)\n\n\u03b1 = \u03c33 (\u03b13 \u2212 Q/2) + \u03c34 (\u03b14 \u2212 Q/2) \u2212 nb \u2212 mb\u22121 ,\n\u03b1 = Q \u2212 \u03c31 (\u03b11 \u2212 Q/2) \u2212 \u03c32 (\u03b12 \u2212 Q/2) + nb + mb\u22121 ,\n\u03b1 = Q \u2212 \u03c33 (\u03b13 \u2212 Q/2) \u2212 \u03c34 (\u03b14 \u2212 Q/2) + nb + mb\u22121 ,\n\nwhere n, m \u2208 Z\u22650 , \u03c3i \u2208 {+, \u2212}, i = 1, . . . , 4. As long as\n(88)\n\n|R(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )| < Q/2;\n\n|R(Q \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )| < Q/2;\n\n|R(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 )| < Q/2;\n\n|R(Q \u2212 \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 )| < Q/2,\n\n+\none finds that all the poles in (87) are strictly to the left or right of the contour Q\n2 + iR of integration\nover \u03b1. The integral over \u03b1 is analytic w.r.t. \u03b14 , . . . , \u03b11 in this case. When continuing outside (88)\none finds that poles from (87) would cross the axis Q\n2 + iR. To define the meromorphic continuation\none may use the reflection property (47) together with the fact that F\u03b1 = FQ\u2212\u03b1 , to \"unfold\" the\n\u03b1-integration to an integral over the full axis Q\n2 + iR. Let us furthermore introduce\n\u0001\n\u0001\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\n(89)\n\u03b1\u00b1\n\u03b1\u00b1\n43 = 2 \u2212 \u03b13 \u00b1 2 \u2212 \u03b14 .\n21 = 2 \u2212 \u03b11 \u00b1 2 \u2212 \u03b12 ,\n\n\u03c0\nThanks to the reflection symmetry \u03b1i \u2192 Q\u2212\u03b1i it suffices to consider the case that arg(\u03b1\u00b1\n21 ) \u2208 [0, 2 ]\n\u00b1\n\u03c0\nand arg(\u03b143 ) \u2208 [0, 2 ]. The definition of the meromorphic continuation is straightforward in the case\n\u00b1\nthat the imaginary parts of \u03b1\u00b1\n21 and \u03b143 are all different from zero and from each other. In this case\n\n\f-28one simply has to deform the original contour Q\n2 + iR to a contour that is indented around the strings\n+\niR.\nEquivalently\none may use a contour that is the sum of Q\nof poles that have crossed Q\n2\n2 + iR\nand a finite sum of small circles around the poles just mentioned. For concreteness let us consider\nQ\nthe case that R(\u03b1\u00b1\n21 ) > 0. One then has a contour consisting of 2 + iR and small circles around the\npoles at\n(90)\n\n\u22121\n\u03b1 = \u03b1\u00b1\n;\n21 \u2212 nb \u2212 mb\n\nn, m \u2208 Z\u22650 ,\n\nR(\u03b1) >\n\n\u22121\n\u03b1 = \u03b1\u00b1\n;\n43 \u2212 nb \u2212 mb\n\nn, m \u2208 Z\u22650 ,\n\nR(\u03b1) >\n\nQ\n2,\nQ\n2,\n\ntogether with their \"reflected partners\" obtained by \u03b1 \u2192 Q \u2212 \u03b1.\nIt remains to consider the following cases:\n\u00b1\n(1) The imaginary part of one of \u03b1\u00b1\n21 , \u03b143 becomes zero. It is enough to consider the case\n\u2212\n\u22121\nI(\u03b121 ) \u2192 0. One finds a collision of the poles \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2212\nthat have crossed\n21 \u2212 nb \u2212 mb\nQ\n\u2212\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u22121\nonly if 2\u03b1\u2212\n21 = Q + (n +\n2 + iR from the left with the poles \u03b1 = Q \u2212 \u03b121 + n b + m b\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22121\nn )b + (m + m )b , so that 2\u03b1 = (1 + n \u2212 n)b + (1 + m \u2212 m)b . The Verma module V\u03b1\nwill therefore generically contain a singular subspace. However, in these cases it is easy to\ncheck that \u03b12 and \u03b11 satisfy the fusion rules of Theorem 1. By our discussion in the previous\nsubsection one observes that the conformal blocks F\u03b1 remain nonsingular at these values of\n(\u03b1, \u03b12 , \u03b11 ). But this means that all of the poles that can potentially arise will be cancelled by\nthe zeros of the factors \u03a5(2\u03b1) and \u03a5(2Q \u2212 2\u03b1) contained in C(\u03b14 , \u03b13 , \u03b1)C(\u1fb1, \u03b12 , \u03b11 ).\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n(2) I(\u03b1+\n21 ) = I(\u03b121 ) or I(\u03b143 ) = I(\u03b143 ): The first case requires \u2206\u03b11 = \u2206r,s for some\n\u22650\nr, s \u2208 Z . The zeros of the factor \u03a5(2\u03b11 ) in C(\u1fb1, \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) prevent the occurrence of a\nsingularity. The second case is treated analogously.\n\u00b1\n+\n\u2212\n(3) I(\u03b1\u00b1\n43 ) = I(\u03b121 ): Here it suffices to consider I(\u03b143 ) = I(\u03b121 ), all other cases being\n\u22121\nrelated to this one by reflections \u03b1i \u2192 Q \u2212 \u03b1i .

CANONICAL QUANTIZATION\nOne may view the DOZZ-proposal as providing a complete description of Liouville theory in the\nR\nenergy representation: It is trivial to rewrite H \u2243 R+ WP as decomposition of H into eigenspaces\nof the Hamiltonian H = L0 + L\u03040 . However, it is difficult to get insight into the physics of Liouville\ntheory on the basis of this representation only: One would like to have something like a Schr\u00f6dingeror coordinate representation, where states in Liouville theory are represented by wave-functions on\n\"target-space\". We are trying to address the following two questions in the present Part II of our\npaper:\n(i) Does such a representation exist?\n(ii) What can be learned from it?\nThe basis for our discussion will be the description of Liouville theory as provided by our previous\ndiscussion of the DOZZ-proposal. We will propose a certain picture, many consequences of which\nare found to be consistent with the DOZZ-proposal. Moreover, it provides a more intuitive interpretation for some of the otherwise mysterious consequences of the DOZZ-proposal, like the reflection\nproperty and the associated Seiberg-bound.\nHowever, our discussion will remain in some respects inconclusive. In fact, we regard some of the\nquestions that we are going to discuss as extremely interesting open problems for the future study of\nquantum Liouville theory.\n\n8. THE PROBLEM OF CANONICAL QUANTIZATION\nLet us start by formulating what we will mean when speaking of \"canonical quantization\" in the\ncontext of Liouville theory.\n\n8.1. Classical theory\nClassically one may introduce the canonical formalism by starting from the action (1) and defining\n1\n\u2202t \u03c6. By introducing the Poisson bracket\nthe momentum conjugate to \u03c6 as \u03a0\u03c6 = 8\u03c0\n{\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3), \u03c6(\u03c3 \u2032 )} = \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 )\n\n(91)\nand the canonical Hamiltonian H\n(92)\n\nH =\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\nd\u03c3\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0\u03a02\u03c6\n\n1\n+\n(\u2202\u03c3 \u03c6)2 + \u03bcc e\u03c6\n16\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\none may recast the Liouville equation of motion in the Hamiltonian form\n(93)\n\n\u2202t \u03c6(\u03c3, t) = {H, \u03c6(\u03c3, t)},\n\n\u2202t \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3, t) = {H, \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3, t)}.\n\n\f-308.2. Notion of canonical quantization\nNaively one would want to define the algebra of observables to be generated by operators \u03c6(\u03c3)\nand \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3) that satisfy commutation relations obtained from (91) by replacing { , } \u2192 ~i [ , ]. Recall\n1\nthat we write ~ as ~ = b2 and use the rescaled fields \u03c6 = 2b\n\u03c6 and \u03a0\u03c6 = 2b \u03a0\u03c6 when discussing\n\u0002\n\u0003\nthe quantum theory. The canonical commutation relations would take the form \u03c6(\u03c3), \u03c6(\u03c3 \u2032 ) = 0,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3), \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3 \u2032 ) = 0 and\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(94)\n\u03c6(\u03c3) , \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3 \u2032 ) = i\u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 ).\nThe fields for nonzero time will then be given as solutions of the quantum equation of motion, which\none would expect to be of the form\n(\u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202\u03c32 )\u03c6 = \u22124\u03c0\u03bcb [e2b\u03c6 ]b .\n\n(95)\n\nThe notation [O]b is supposed to indicate the quantum corrections (e.g. normal ordering, other\nrenormalizations) that are necessary to properly define an operator [O]b that corresponds to the\nclassical observable O upon taking the semi-classical limit b \u2192 0. We have introduced \u03bc = b\u22122 \u03bcc .\nThere are of course many well-known subtleties associated with such a formulation: Due to shortdistance singularities one can not expect \u03c6(x), \u03a0\u03c6 (x), x = (t, \u03c3) to represent well-defined operators.\nOne might, however, hope that the situation is better for the Fourier-modes of \u03c6(\u03c3), \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3), which\nare good operators at least in the case of the free bosonic field field theory in two dimensions. The\nFourier modes q, p, an , bn of \u03c6(\u03c3), \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3) will be introduced such that\nX\nX1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3) = 2p +\nan e\u2212in\u03c3 + bn ein\u03c3\n(96) \u03c6(\u03c3) = q + i\nan e\u2212in\u03c3 + bn ein\u03c3 .\nn\nn6=0\n\nn6=0\n\nInstead of the canonical commutation relations for \u03c6(\u03c3), \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3) one would then consider the following commutation relations:\n(97)\n\n[p, q] = \u2212 2i\n\n[an , am ] =\n\nn\n2 \u03b4n,\u2212m\n\n[bn , bm ] =\n\nn\n2 \u03b4n,\u2212m ,\n\ntogether with the hermiticity relations\nq\u2020 = q\n\n(98)\n\np\u2020 = p,\n\na\u2020n = a\u2212n ,\n\nb\u2020n = b\u2212n .\n\nThe Liouville Hilbert space H would be required to form a representation of the commutation relations (97), with dynamics being generated by a Hamiltonian of the form\n(99)\n\nH = 2p2 + 2\n\nX\n\n[a\u2212k ak + b\u2212k bk ]b + \u03bc\n\nk>0\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c3 [e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) ]b .\n\n0\n\n8.3. Representation?\nBut how to choose H? The most natural choice might seem to be HF = L2 (R) \u2297 F \u2297 F, where\nthe zero modes q and p are realized on L2 (R) as multiplication operator and \u2212 2i \u2202q respectively,\nand F \u2297 F is the Fock-space generated by acting with the oscillators a\u2212n , b\u2212n , n > 0 on the\nFock-vacuum \u03a9. But it is well-know that there exist many inequivalent unitary representations of\nthe canonical commutation relations. A large class of such representations may e.g. be obtained by\nimproper Bogoliubov transformations of the Fock-space representation [Bz]. Moreover, for massive\n\n\f-31quantum field theories it is known to be impossible to define an interacting quantum dynamics when\nusing a Fock-space representation for the canonical commutation relations (see e.g. [Ha], p.55).\nThis issue is of course closely related to the problem of defining the interaction term\nR 2\u03c0\n\u03bc 0 d\u03c3 [e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) ]b . How to choose the ordering of the a\u2212n , b\u2212n ? Are there other quantum corrections (renormalizations of parameters, counterterms) necessary to define H? It could also be that\nthere are many ways to define (H, H) which would all represent canonical quantizations of Liouville\ntheory in the sense of the previous subsection. Here, however, we are looking for a very particular\none: H should form a representation of two commuting Virasoro algebras and H = L0 + L\u03040 . If\nconformal invariance is taken as the primary requirement, it is not clear whether it is possible to insist on the strict interpretation of \"the rules of canonical quantization\". It may become necessary to\nconsider weak forms of the above requirement like only demanding that the canonical commutation\nrelations hold between a dense set of states in H.\nTo complete the confusion, let us note that it is not clear what the precise sense of the hermiticity\nrelations (98) should be. For example, p might be symmetric, but not self-adjoint: Just think of\nquantum mechanics on the half-line, where p2 can be made self-adjoint, but p can't (otherwise one\ncould \"leave\" the half-line by means of some translation eitp ). It could even be much worse: The\noperators q, p, an , bn might be too singular to have a dense domain of definition.\nR EMARK 4. - For readers considering such discussions as pedantic let us make the following comment: A string background can abstractly be defined as BRST-cohomology of a collection of conformal field theories with total central charge 26 or 10, tensored with ghosts. Scattering amplitudes are\nconstructed from correlation functions of the conformal field theories. One would of course like to\nhave an interpretation of the amplitudes as coming from the perturbative expansion of a string field\ntheory around some target space that is supposed to be described by the collection of conformal field\ntheories. What is the target space to a given collection of abstractly defined conformal field theories?\nOne might try to get coordinates for the target space from the operators that describe the motion of\nthe center of mass of the string, the zero modes. But what if these operators cease to be well-defined\nin the case of interacting conformal field theories? This could indicate some obstruction to point-like\nlocalization in target space, some \"fuzziness\", \"stringy uncertainty\" or \"non-commutativity of target\nspace\".\n\n9. CANONICAL QUANTIZATION FROM DOZZ-PROPOSAL?\nLet us now examine to what extend one may view the DOZZ-proposal as providing a canonical\nquantization of Liouville theory. The first task is of course to reconstruct the Liouville field itself.\nThe identification V\u03b1 = e2\u03b1\u03c6 that one has semi-classically suggests that V\u03b1 (x) = [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (x),\nx = (t, \u03c3), and furthermore\n\u0001\n1\n(100)\n\u03c6(\u03c3) = 12 \u2202\u03b1 V\u03b1 (\u03c3)|\u03b1=0 ,\n\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3) = 4\u03c0\n\u2202t \u2202\u03b1 V\u03b1 (t, \u03c3)|\u03b1=0 t=0 .\nWe will see that this definition produces fields \u03c6(\u03c3), \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3) that can be shown to represent the\ncanonical commutation relations in a weak sense i.e. between states from a dense subset of H.\nMoreover, the euclidean field \u03c6(z, z\u0304) weakly solves a natural quantum version of the Liouville\nequation of motion.\n\n\f-329.1. Canonical fields\nFirst of all, we need to recover fields V\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3) on the euclidean cylinder from the fields V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304)\non the Riemann sphere that are furnished by the DOZZ-proposal. Fields V\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3), on the euclidean\ncylinder are recovered from V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304) by means of the conformal mapping z = e\u03c4 +i\u03c3 : V\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3) =\n|z|2\u2206\u03b1 V\u03b1 (z, z\u0304). The fields V\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3) are well-defined as operators for negative euclidean time \u03c4 < 0.\nWe may then define euclidean fields \u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3), \u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c4, \u03c3) as follows\n\u0001\ni\n\u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3) = 12 \u2202\u03b1 V\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3)|\u03b1=0 ,\n(101)\n\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c4, \u03c3) = 4\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c4 \u2202\u03b1 V\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3)|\u03b1=0 .\nMatrix elements such as h\u03c82 |\u03c6(\u03c42 , \u03c32 )\u03c6(\u03c41 , \u03c31 )|\u03c81 i, h\u03c82 |\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c42 , \u03c32 )\u03c6(\u03c41 , \u03c31 )|\u03c81 i etc. will be welldefined for \u03c42 > \u03c41 and can be recovered from the matrix elements h\u03c82 |V\u03b12 (z2 , z\u03042 )V\u03b11 (z1 , z\u03041 )|\u03c81 i.\nMoreover, it is possible to recover the matrix elements of the Liouville field from the DOZZ\nthree point function: Let us start by considering hP |\u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3)|\u03c8i, where |\u03c8i is of the form |\u03c8i =\nR\n1\n2\u03c0 R+ dP \u03c8(P )|P i. This matrix element is by our definition (101) represented as\n1\nlim \u2202\nhP |\u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3)|\u03c8i =\n4 \u03b1\u21920 \u03b1\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndP \u2032\nC\n2\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nQ\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u2032 2\u03c4 (\u2206(P )\u2212\u2206(P \u2032 ))\n\u2212 iP, \u03b1, Q\n\u03c8(P \u2032 ),\n2 + iP e\n\nTaking the limit requires some care since the contour of integration will be pinched between poles\napproaching the real axis in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 (cf. our discussion in Section 7). The result may be\nwritten as\nZ\u221e\n\u2032\ni\n1\ndP \u2032 2\u03c4 (\u2206(P )\u2212\u2206(P \u2032 )) \u03bb b (P \u2212P ) \u03a5(\u22122iP \u2032)\u03a5(+2iP )\nhP |\u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3)|\u03c8i =\n\u03c8(P \u2032 )\ne\n4\n2\u03c0\n|\u03a5(i(P \u2212 P \u2032 ))\u03a5(i(P + P \u2032 ))|2\n\u2212\u221e\n(102)\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u03c8(P ) ,\n+\n\u2212\n(P \u2212 P \u2032 )2\n(P + P \u2032 )2\n2\n\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 \u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(b2 )b2\u22122b .

Wittgenstein)\n\nWe are now going to discuss an assumption concerning the representation of the operators q, p,\nan , bn that would lead to a representation of states by wave-functions on target-space: Assume that\nZ \u2295\n(109)\ndq Fq \u2297 Fq ,\nH \u2243 HSchr = L2 (R) \u2297 F \u2297 F \u2243\nR\n\nwhere q and p are represented on functions \u03c8(q) \u2208 L2 (R) as the operator of multiplication with q\nand the operator \u2212 2i \u2202q respectively, and the nonzero modes an , bn are represented in F \u2297 F by a\nstandard Fock-representation generated from a vector \u03a9 \u2208 F \u2297 F that satisfies an \u03a9 = 0 = bn \u03a9.\nWithin such a Schr\u00f6dinger representation for the zero mode one could represent states by wavefunctions \u03c8(q) that take values in F \u2297 F. The scalar product would be represented as\nZ\n\u0001\n(110)\ndq \u03c82 (q), \u03c81 (q) F \u2297F ,\nh\u03c82 , \u03c81 iH =\nR\n\n\f-35where (., .)F \u2297F denotes the scalar product in F \u2297 F.\nOur assumption (109) has fair chances to be wrong (cf. our remarks in Subsections 8.3 and 9.1,\nas well as the discussion in Section 12 below). Nevertheless it will help us to develop a certain\npicture for the \"target-space\" physics of Liouville theory. Many features of that picture turn to be\nconsistent with the DOZZ proposal in a rather nontrivial way. Let us therefore adopt (109) as a\nworking hypothesis that is useful to discuss certain issues, but which will ultimately have to be\nreplaced by some refined description.\n10.1. Asymptotic correspondence to the free field\nIn the representation (109) one will find the Hamiltonian H to be represented as a second order\ndifferential operator of the form\nZ 2\u03c0\nX\n1 2\n(a\u2212k ak + b\u2212k bk ) + \u03bc\n(111)\nd\u03c3 [e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) ]b ,\nH = \u2212 \u2202q + Nb + 2\n2\n0\nk>0\n\nR 2\u03c0\nwhere Nb is some normal-ordering constant. At least semi-classically one has \u03bc 0 d\u03c3 [e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) ]b \u221d\ne2bq , which vanishes exponentially for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. It seems plausible to conjecture that quantum\ncorrections in the interaction term [e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) ]b will preserve the zero mode dependence \u221d e2bq , at least\nin leading order for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The role of the interaction will therefore become negligible if one\nconsiders wave-packets that have support in regions with large negative values of q. It should be\npossible to approximate the time-evolution of such wave-packets by the time-evolution generated by\nthe free Hamiltonian\nX\n1\n(112)\n(a\u2212k ak + b\u2212k bk ).\nHF = \u2212 \u2202q2 + Nb + 2\n2\nk>0\n\nIn this spirit one would also expect to have\n(113)\n\n[e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) ]b\n\n\u223c\n\nq\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n: e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) :,\n\nwhere : O : denotes the operator obtained by the usual free field normal ordering. Next-to-leading\norder corrections in the asymptotics for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e should then be represented by\nZ 2\u03c0\nX\n1 2\n\u2202\n+\nN\n+\n2\n(114)\nHF\n=\n\u2212\n(a\na\n+\nb\nb\n)\n+\n\u03bc\nd\u03c3 : e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) : .\nb\n\u2212k k\n\u2212k k\n\u03bc\n2 q\n0\nk>0\n\n10.2. Generalized eigenfunctions of H\nLet us now examine how (generalized) eigenstates of H would be described in the representation\n(109). One would want to construct generalized eigenfunctions \u03c8E,\u03bd (q) to each eigenstate |E, \u03bdi\nof H, where \u03bd is just some label for the degeneracy of the eigenvalue E for the moment. This is\nof course impossible unless one knows the precise definition for H. However, if the asymptotic\ncorrespondence with free field theory, as discussed in the previous subsection, really holds, one may\nat least discuss the asymptotic behavior of \u03c8E,\u03bd (q) for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e, which is enough to get some\nimportant information on the spectrum.\n\n\f-36The asymptotic behavior of \u03c8E,\u03bd (q) for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e should then of course be given by solutions\nF\nF\nF\n\u03c8E\n(q) of the free eigenvalue equation HF \u03c8E\n(q) = E\u03c8E\n(q), which take the form\n(115)\n\nF\n\u03c8E\n(q) = e2iP q fn+ + e\u22122iP q fn\u2212 ,\n\nE = P 2 + Nb + n,\n\nP\nwhere fn\u00b1 \u2208 F \u2297 F are eigenstates of the number operator N = 2 k>0 (a\u2212k ak + b\u2212k bk ) which\nhave the eigenvalue n. Wave-functions \u03c8E,\u03bd (q) with asymptotic behavior (115) would correspond\nto generalized eigenstates in the continuous spectrum Hc of H. However, a priori it is not at all\nclear for which choices for the parameters P , fn+ , fn\u2212 it is possible to \"integrate\" the eigenvalue\nequation H\u03c8E = E\u03c8E to obtain a (plane-wave) normalizable wave-function \u03c8[P, fn+ , fn\u2212 ](q) with\nasymptotics (115). But if H forms a representation of the canonical commutation relations for the\nnonzero modes one would need that existence of a wave-function \u03c8[P, fn+ , fn\u2212 ](q) implies existence\nof \u03c8[P, an fn+ , an fn\u2212 ](q) and \u03c8[P, bn fn+ , bn fn\u2212 ](q). It follows that Hc must decompose into a collection of Fock-spaces parameterized by P :\nHc \u2243\n\n(116)\n\nZ\n\n\u2295\n\nd\u03bc(P ) FP \u2297 FP ,\n\nR\n\nwhere the subscript P in the notation FP \u2297 FP indicates that the action of H on FP \u2297 FP is\nrepresented as P 2 + Nb + N.\n\n10.3. Comparison with DOZZ-proposal\nThis seems to be as far as one can get on the basis of the asymptotic correspondence to the free\nfield. Let us now compare to the structure of the spectrum as given by the DOZZ-proposal. First of\nall, the latter is purely continuous. One would therefore need to identify Hc \u2261 H. Second, instead of\n(116) we had found in Part I a similar expansion with Fock-spaces FP replaced by Verma modules\nVP . But this is of course perfectly consistent since FP \u2243 VP as vector spaces (we will discuss the\nrealization of conformal symmetry later).\nThe interesting point to observe is that comparison with (59) implies that S = R+ , only half of\nthe spectrum of free field theory. This also implies that for each value of P it suffices to specify e.g.\nthe vector fn+ in (115). The vector fn\u2212 must be a function of fn+ and P , fn\u2212 = R(P )fn+ . This is very\nplausible from the point of view of the \"quasi-quantum mechanical\" picture that we are developing:\nWhatever possible quantum modifications of the potential may be, as long as they do not make it\nvanish in the opposite limit q \u2192 +\u221e, one will have to impose a boundary condition concerning the\nbehavior of wave-functions for q \u2192 +\u221e which selects a particular choice of fn\u2212 in dependence of\nfn+ and P (or vice versa).\nThe resulting picture is that the wave-functions \u03c8P,f (q) corresponding to generalized eigenstates\n|P, fi are uniquely specified by the coefficient f \u2208 F \u2297 F \u2243 VP \u2297 VP of the \"in-going\" plane wave\ne2iP q , with coefficient of the \"reflected out-going\" plane wave e\u22122iP q being given by the reflection\noperator R(P ):\n(117)\n\n\u03c8P,f (q)\n\n\u223c\n\nq\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nF\n\u03c8P,f\n(q),\n\nF\n\u03c8P,f\n(q) = e2iP q f + e\u22122iP q R(P )f.\n\n\f-37The wave-functions \u03c8P,f (q) describe the generalized Fourier transformation from the zero mode\nSchr\u00f6dinger representation (109) to the spectral representation\nH \u2243 H\n\n(118)\n\nspec\n\n=\n\nZ\u2295\n\ndP\nFP \u2297 FP .\n2\u03c0\n\nR+\n\nLet us finally consider the wave-function \u03c8P (q) \u2261 \u03c8P,\u03a9 (q). For both terms in (117) to produce\nthe same eigenvalue of H \u223c HF one needs to have R(P )\u03a9 = R(P )\u03a9, introducing the reflection\namplitude R(P ). Therefore\n(119)\n\n\u03c8P (q)\n\n\u223c\n\nq\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c8PF (q),\n\n\u03c8PF (q) = (e2iP q + e\u22122iP q R(P ))\u03a9.\n\n10.4. Reflection in the potential\nWe will now try to clarify the physical interpretation of R(P ): We claim that R(P ) represents\nthe scattering operator that describes how a wave-packet coming in from q \u2192 \u2212\u221e for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nis reflected into another wave packet that is pushed out to q \u2192 \u2212\u221e for t \u2192 \u221e. The Liouville\ninteraction acts like a perfectly reflecting potential \"wall\". To verify this statement let us consider a\nwave-packet\n\u03c8(q, t) = e\u2212iHt \u03c8(q) =\n\n\u221e\nX Z dP\ne\u2212iEP,f t hP, f|\u03c8i \u03c8P,f (q),\n2\u03c0\nf\u2208B 0\n\nwhere we assume that the orthonormal basis B for F \u2297 F was chosen such that all f \u2208 B are\neigenstates of the number operator N with eigenvalue N (f), so that H|P, fi = EP,f |P, fi with EP,f \u2261\n2\n2P 2 + Q2 + N (f). By the method of stationary phase it is possible to see that \u03c8(q, t) will vanish\nfor any finite q as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the wave-packet is pushed out to large negative values of q: In order\nto pick out the mode with energy 2P 2 + Q2 /2 as the dominant saddle point contribution one would\nhave to consider \u03c8(2P t, t).\nSince the wave packet is asymptotically supported for negative infinite values of q, one may\napproximate the \u03c8P,f (q) by their asymptotic behavior e2iP q f (the term with e\u22122iP q gets suppressed\nin this limit). One is thereby led to the conclusion that the behavior of \u03c8(q, t) for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e will be\nF\nrepresented as time evolution according to the free Hamiltonian HF , \u03c8(q, t) \u223c e\u2212iH t \u03c8 in (q) with\n(120)\n\n\u221e\nX Z dP\n\u03c8 (q) =\nhP, f|\u03c8i e2iP q f\n2\u03c0\nin\n\nf\u2208B\n\n\u2208\n\nHF \u2261 L2 (R) \u2297 F \u2297 F\n\n0\n\nF\n\nIn the other limit t \u2192 +\u221e one would similarly find \u03c8(q, t) \u223c e\u2212iH t \u03c8 out (q) with\n(121)\n\n\u03c8\n\nout\n\n\u221e\nX Z dP\nhP, f|\u03c8i e\u22122iP q R(P )f\n(q) =\n2\u03c0\n\n\u2208\n\nf\u2208B 0\n\nOne may then define generalized wave operators as\nW\u00b1 (H0 , H, J\u00b1 ) = lim\n\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\neiH0 t J\u00b1 e\u2212iHt ,\n\nHF\n\n\f-38where the identification maps J\u00b1 : H \u2192 HF are defined by J\u00b1 \u03c8P,f (q) = e\u22132iP q f, and the corresponding scattering operator S = (\u03a9\u2212 )\u22121 \u03a9+ : HF \u2192 HF is easily read off from (120) and (121) to\nbe represented by our stationary reflection operator R(P ). For this identification to be consistent we\nevidently need that R(P ) is unitary.\n10.5. Conformal symmetry in the quantum theory\nLet us observe that the asymptotic correspondence between Liouville field and a free field that\nwas discussed in Subsection 10.1 would suffice to conclude that quantum Liouville theory becomes\na conformal field theory upon choosing the normal ordering constant Nb appropriately:\nIf the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian can be represented as in (118) one may always\nintroduce an action of two commuting copies of the Virasoro algebra on H by using usual free field\nrepresentations on the Fock-spaces FP . The action on the first tensor factor of FP \u2297 FP would be\ndefined in terms of the generators\nX\nLF\nak an\u2212k ,\nn 6= 0,\nn (P ) = (2P + inQ)an +\nk6=0,n\n\n(122)\n\n2\nLF\n0 (P ) = P +\n\n2\n\nQ\n+2\n4\n\nX\n\na\u2212k ak ,\n\nk>0\n\nwhereas the action on the second tensor factor is generated by operators L\u0304n that are obtained by\nreplacing an \u2192 bn in the expressions (122). The spectral decomposition (118) then allows us to\ndefine operators Ln , L\u0304n on H by means of the relations\n(123)\n\nLn |P, fi = |P, LF\nn (P )fi\n\nL\u0304n |P, fi = |P, L\u0304F\nn (P )fi.\n\nThe operators Ln , L\u0304n satisfy the usual commutation relations of the Virasoro algebra with central\ncharge c given in terms of the parameter b by the relations\n(124)\n\nc = 1 + 6Q2 ,\n\nQ = b + b\u22121 .\n\nHowever, the crucial property for identifying conformal transformations as a symmetry of the\ntheory is the fact that the Hamiltonian is recovered from L0 , L\u03040 as\n(125)\n\nH = L0 + L\u03040 .\n2\n\nFor this to be the case one just needs that the normal ordering constant Nb is equal to Q2 . Taking\ninto account that the Fock space representation FP is irreducible for real values of P [Fr], one\nmay identify the spectral representation (118) of H with the decomposition of H into irreducible\nrepresentations \u2261 Verma modules VP \u2297 VP of the Virasoro algebra. Under this correspondence one\nidentifies the highest weight state v \u2297 v of VP \u2297 VP with |P i \u2261 |P, \u03a9i \u2261 |P, v \u2297 vi corresponding\nto the wave-function \u03c8P (q) with asymptotics (119).\n10.6. Consistency of conformal symmetry with reflection\nThe next thing one needs to observe, however, is the fact that the requirement of having a consistent realization of conformal symmetry in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation HSchr imposes strong\nconstraints on the form of the reflection operator R(P ). If one considers wave-packets supported\n\n\f-39for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e, one finds that consistency of (123),(122) with the asymptotic form (117) of wavefunctions requires that\nX\nLF\nak an\u2212k\nn =(\u2212i\u2202q + inQ)an +\n\n(126)\n\nLn\n\n\u223c\n\nq\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nLF\nn , where\n\nk6=0,n\n\nX\n1\n2\n2\na\u2212k ak .\nLF\n0 = (\u2212\u2202q + Q ) + 2\n4\nk>0\n\nHowever, the action of the Virasoro generators Ln on the second term in (117) may now be expressed\n\u22122iP q F\nin two ways: Either as e\u22122iP q R(P )LF\nLn (\u2212P )R(P )f\nn (P )f by using (123) or alternatively as e\nwhen using (126) directly. We conclude that we must have\n(127)\n\nF\nR(P )LF\nn (P ) = Ln (\u2212P )R(P )\n\nF\nR(P )L\u0304F\nn (P ) = L\u0304n (\u2212P )R(P ),\n\nso the reflection operator R(P ) must be an intertwining operator between the Fock-representations\nFP and F\u2212P .\nSuch an operator is uniquely determined by this intertwining property in terms of the reflection\namplitude R(P ) which characterizes the action of R(P ) on the Fock-vacuum \u03a9. This is easily seen\nby recalling that the Fock-space representation FP \u2297 FP is isomorphic to VP \u2297 VP for P \u2208 R. This\nmeans that any f \u2208 FP \u2297 FP can be uniquely written as the action of some polynomial PP,f in the\nF\nvariables Ln (P ), L\u0304n (P ) on the Fock-vacuum \u03a9, i.e. f = PP,f [LF\nn (P ), L\u0304n (P )]\u03a9. The intertwining\nproperty (127) then implies that\n\u0002 F\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF\nF\nR(P )f = R(P ) PP,f LF\nn (P ), L\u0304n (P ) \u03a9 = R(P ) PP,f Ln (\u2212P ), L\u0304n (\u2212P ) \u03a9.\nConformal symmetry therefore reduces the description of the scattering of wave-packets in the Liouville potential to the knowledge of a single function, the reflection amplitude R(P ). Let us note\nthat R(P ) will be unitary iff |R(P )| = 1.\n10.7. Macroscopic vs. microscopic states\nWe had observed in Part I, Subsection 4.7 that one may naturally consider the analytic continuation\nof states |P i to complex values of P in some distributional sense. This should of course be reflected\nby the existence of an analytic continuation for the corresponding wave-function \u03c8P (q).\nBy means of analytic continuation one may in particular compare \u03c8P (q) and \u03c8\u2212P (q): In view\nof the asymptotics (117) one would find \u03c8P (q) = R(P )\u03c8\u2212P (q). But this is to be compared to the\nreflection property |P i = S( Q\n2 + iP )| \u2212 P i that follows from the DOZZ-proposal. We clearly must\nQ\nhave R(P ) = S( 2 + iP ), so that\n(128)\n\n\u0001\u2212 2iP\n\u0393(1 + 2ibP )\u0393(1 + 2ib\u22121 P )\nb\nR(P ) = \u2212 \u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(b2 )\n.\n\u0393(1 \u2212 2ibP )\u0393(1 \u2212 2ib\u22121 P )\n\nOur discussion in Subsection 4.7 can now easily be rephrased in terms of the asymptotic behavior\nof the wave-functions \u03c8P (q): In view of the asymptotic behavior (119) one would expect the \u03c8P (q)\nto be plane-wave normalizable for P \u2208 R, non-normalizable for P \u2208\n/ R. However, in the latter\ncase one would still expect \u03c8P (q) to represent a distribution |P i that can be defined on the subspace\nof H which is represented by wave-functions \u03c8(q) with sufficiently strong exponential decay. Let\nus adopt the terminology \"macroscopic states\" for the (plane-wave) normalizable states |P, fi with\nP \u2208 R, and \"microscopic states\" for the |P, fi with P \u2208\n/ R, as proposed by Seiberg in [Se].\n\n\f-40The characterization of the domain of hP |, P \u2208\n/ R in terms of the exponential decay properties of\nthe wave-functions \u03c8(q) can easily be translated into our previous characterization of the domain of\nhP | in terms of analyticity of hP |\u03c8i:\nConsider a state |\u03c8i that is represented in the zero mode Schr\u00f6dinger representation by a wavefunction \u03c8(q) which decays for q \u2192 \u221e faster than e2\u03bbq for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The wave-functions of |\u03c8i in\nthe spectral representation,\n(129)\n\nhP, f|\u03c8i =\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndq h \u03c8\u0304P,f (q) , \u03c8(q) iF \u2297F ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwill then be analytic in P as long as the integral in (129) converges. This will be the case for\n|I(P )| < \u03bb. Conversely, if the wave-functions hP, f|\u03c8i in the spectral representation are analytic in\nsome strip around the real axis of width larger than \u03bb, one may get the asymptotic behavior of\n(130)\n\n\u221e\nX Z dP\n\u03c8 (q) hP, f|\u03c8i,\n\u03c8(q) =\n2\u03c0 P,f\nf\u2208B 0\n\nby using unitarity of R(P ) to rewrite the integral over R+ as an integral over the contour R, and\ntaking advantage of the analyticity of the integrand in (130) to shift that contour of integration to the\naxis R + i\u03bb: It follows that \u03c8(q) decays faster as e2\u03bbq for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n10.8. Next to leading order corrections to Virasoro generators\nEquations (126) describe the representation of the Virasoro algebra in (109) only to leading order\nfor q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In next-to-leading order one will need corrections to (126): In order to have a\nF\nconsistent realization of conformal symmetry one needs to have generators LF\nn,\u03bc , L\u0304n,\u03bc such that\nF\nF\nF\nF\nH\u03bc = L0,\u03bc + L\u03040,\u03bc , where H\u03bc was defined in (114). And indeed, there exists such a one-parameter\n\"deformation\" of the representation (126) that preserves the commutation relations:\n(131)\n\nF\nLF\nn,\u03bc = Ln +\n\n\u03bc\n2\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c3 ein\u03c3 : e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) :,\n\n0\n\nF\nand similarly for L\u0304F\nn,\u03bc . It was shown in [CT] that the modified generators Ln,\u03bc indeed satisfy the\nF\nsame algebra as the Ln . It will be important to notice that there is a further deformation of the\ngenerators LF\nn,\u03bc , defined by\n\n(132)\n\nLF\nn,\u03bc,\u03bc\u0303\n\n=\n\nLF\nn,\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\u0303\n+\n2\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c3 ein\u03c3 : e2b\u0303\u03c6(\u03c3) :,\n\n0\n\nwhere b\u0303 = b\u22121 , that still satisfies the same algebra as the LF\nn . This possibility is due to the fact that\n: e2b\u0303\u03c6(\u03c3) : has conformal dimensions (1, 1) just like : e2b\u03c6(\u03c3) :. There is of course a very similar\nF\ndeformation L\u0304F\nn,\u03bc,\u03bc\u0303 of the generators L\u0304n,\u03bc .\nIt seems natural to regard the term proportional to \u03bc\u0303 in (132) as a possible quantum correction in\nthe definition of the Virasoro generators that preserves conformal symmetry.

EXPONENTIAL OPERATORS\nLet us now consider the exponential operators [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3) in more detail.

However, as we are already expecting some trouble with the representation (109), it seems\nimportant to note that all that we will really be using in the following discussion is the assumption\nthat\n(137)\n\n[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c4, \u03c3)\n\n\u223c\n\nq\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n: e2\u03b1\u03c6(\u03c4,\u03c3) :\n\nholds weakly (between wave-packets).\n11.1. State-operator correspondence\nWe had previously (Section 4) discussed the correspondence between vertex operators V\u03b1 and\nmicroscopic states |\u03b1i (in the distributional sense, cf. Subsection 4.7). It may be formulated as\nfollows:\nS TATE - OPERATOR CORRESPONDENCE\nThe vertex operators V\u03b1 are in one-to-one correspondence to the microscopic states |\u03b1i, and create these states via\nh\u03c8|\u03b1i = lim h\u03c8|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)|0i\n(138)\n\nz\u21920\n\nhQ \u2212 \u03b1|\u03c8i = lim h0|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)|\u03c8i |z|4\u2206\u03b1\nz\u2192\u221e\n\nfor \u03c8 \u2208 D\u03b1 ,\n\n\f-42where D\u03b1 \u2282 H is the domain of h\u03b1|.\nWe would now like to show that the above correspondence between operators and states holds if\nand only if R(\u03b1) < Q\n2 as a consequence of the fact that wave-packets get pushed out to q \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nfor t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e:\nR\u221e\nFor simplicity let us consider wave-packets of the form h\u03c8| = 0 dP hP |\u03c8(P ). The generalization to descendants thereof is straightforward. The limit z \u2192 0 corresponds to t \u2192 \u2212e\u2212i\u01eb \u221e in the\nminkowskian formulation. One should therefore analyze\nlim\n\n(139)\n\nt\u2192\u2212e\u2212i\u01eb \u221e\n\ne2it\u2206\u03b1 h\u03c8|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (t, \u03c3)|0i.\n\nThe limit (139) may be related to the asymptotic behavior of wave-packets for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e by changing\nfrom the Heisenberg to the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, h\u03c8|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (t, \u03c3)|0i = h\u03c8(t)|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|0i. As\ndiscussed in the previous section, one will for t \u2192 \u2212e\u2212i\u01eb \u221e find wave-packets to be supported far\noff the potential, i.e. moving off to q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. On such wave-packets one may therefore represent the\nmicroscopic state [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|0i by its leading q \u2192 \u2212\u221e behavior : exp(2\u03b1\u03c6(\u03c3)) : exp(\u2212Qq)\u03a9. A\nnon-vanishing result can indeed only be obtained for R(\u03b1) \u2264 Q/2 since otherwise the wave function\nof [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|0i vanishes where the wave-packet h\u03c8(t)| is supported for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e. One may then\nrepresent the above matrix element in the limit t \u2192 \u2212\u221e by a matrix element in H between the\nR\u221e\n\u22122iP q \u2020\n\u03a9 :\nstates |0iF = e\u2212Qq \u03a9 and F h\u03c8| = 0 dP\n2\u03c0 \u03c8\u0304(P )e\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u2212e\u2212i\u01eb \u221e\n\ne2it\u2206\u03b1 h\u03c8(t)|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|0i =\n\n=\n=\n\nlim\n\ne2it\u2206\u03b1 F h\u03c8(t)| : e2\u03b1\u03c6(\u03c3) : |0iF\n\nlim\n\ne2it\u2206\u03b1 F h\u03c8| : e2\u03b1\u03c6(t,\u03c3) : |0iF .\n\nt\u2192\u2212e\u2212i\u01eb \u221e\n\nt\u2192\u2212e\u2212i\u01eb \u221e\n2\u03b1q\n|0iF\nF h\u03c8|e\n\n=\n\nF h\u03c8|\u03b1iF\n\n= h\u03c8|\u03b1i\n\nWe conclude that only the operators [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3) with R(\u03b1) \u2264 Q/2 are in correspondence with\nmicroscopic/macroscopic states.\n11.2. Seiberg bound\nThe operators V\u03b1 as characterized by the three point functions C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) satisfy the remarkable reflection property V\u03b1 = R(\u03b1)VQ\u2212\u03b1 . We would like to identify the operators V\u03b1 with the\n(suitably quantum corrected) exponential operators [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b . As identifying property for the latter\nwe had required that these operators have leading asymptotics for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e given by the standard\nfree field normal ordered exponential operators : exp(2\u03b1\u03c6) :, cf. (137). But the reflection property\nV\u03b1 = R(\u03b1)VQ\u2212\u03b1 then produces a problem for identifying operators [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b for R(\u03b1) > Q\n2 : In that\ncase : exp(2(Q \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c6) : would dominate over : exp(2\u03b1\u03c6) : in the asymptotics for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e, so that\none would identify V\u03b1 = R(\u03b1)[e2(Q\u2212\u03b1)\u03c6 ]b . If one insists on characterizing exponential operators\n[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b by having leading asymptotics (137), this simply means that one does not find any operators\n2\u03b1\u03c6\n]b , R(\u03b1) > Q\n[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b , R(\u03b1) > Q\n2 among the operators V\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 C. So how about operators [e\n2:\nDo they escape our methods or don't they exist? An argument in favor of the second possibility was\ngiven by N. Seiberg in [Se], which is why this issue goes under the name of \"Seiberg-bound\".\nLet us translate Seiberg's argument into the present framework: A slight modification of the\nargument used in the previous subsection gives\n(140)\n\nh\u03c8|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|0i = 0.\n\n\f-43To see this, it suffices to write\nh\u03c8|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|0i =\n(141)\n\n=\n\nlim h\u03c8(t)|e\u2212iHt [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)eiHt |0i\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nlim h\u03c8(t)|[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3, \u2212t)|0i.\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nBy again using that [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3, \u2212t)|0i has zero mode dependence \u223c exp((2\u03b1 \u2212 Q)q) and that the\nwave-function representing h\u03c8(t)| will tend to zero for any finite value of q as t \u2192 \u221e, one concludes\nthat the expression vanishes. But now it is easy to see that (140) indeed implies that\nh\u03c82 |[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3)|\u03c81 i = 0.\n\n(142)\n\nTo this aim one only has to invoke state-operator correspondence as discussed in the previous subsection to represent |\u03c82 i as the limit for z \u2192 0 of a state of the form\n|\u03c82 (z)i =\n\n(143)\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndP\nV\u03b1P (\u03b6P |z)|0i,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b6P \u2208 VP \u2297 VP .\n\n0\n\nBy using mutual locality of V\u03b1P (\u03b6P |z) and [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3) one reduces (142) to (140). We conclude that\nthe Seiberg-bound is a simple consequence of our potential scattering picture of Liouville dynamics.\n11.3. Asymptotics vs. analyticity\nWe would finally like to understand the analytic properties of the three point functions (meromorphic continuation, location and residues of poles) from the point of view of the zero mode Sch\u00f6dinger\nrepresentation.\nLet us begin by noting that the smoothing properties of the operators V\u03b1 , R(\u03b1) > 0, that we\nnoted in Section 4 are quite easily understood by considering the asymptotic behavior for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nMatrix elements of [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304), |z| < 1, would in the zero mode Schr\u00f6dinger representation (109)\nbe represented as\n(144)\n\nhP2 , f2 |[e\n\n2\u03b1\u03c6\n\n]b (z, z\u0304)|P1 , f1 i =\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndq \u03c8P2 ,f2 (q) , [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)\u03c8P1 ,f1 (q)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\nF \u2297F\n\n,\n\nAs the zero mode dependence of [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304) provides an exponential damping factor for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\none would expect the integration in (144) to converge and define a function that is analytic in\n(145)\n\n{(P2 , P1 ) \u2208 C2 ; |I(P2 \u00b1 P1 )| < R(\u03b1)},\n\nwhich fits our discussion of the DOZZ-proposal in Section 4.\n11.4. Asymptotic expansion\nIn order to study the analytic properties of the matrix elements hP2 , f2 |[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)|P1 , f1 i in the\ncase R(\u03b1) \u2264 0, one will need to take into account sub-leading contributions to the asymptotic behavior of wave-functions for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. On the basis of our discussion in Subsection 10.8, especially\nRemark 6, one expects that H may be approximated by HF\n\u03bc\u03bc\u0303 when studying the asymptotic behavior\nfor q \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n\n\f-44Standard perturbation theory for the Hamiltonian HF\n\u03bc\u03bc\u0303 yields a formal series expansion for eigenfunctions of that operator:\n\u03c8P,f (q) =\n\n(146)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(n,m)\n\n\u03bcn \u03bc\u0303m \u03c8P,f\n\n(q),\n\nm,n=0\n(0,0)\n\nwhere the initial term is given by \u03c8P,f (q) = e2iP q f + e\u22122iP q R(P )f and the higher terms can be\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nexpressed in terms of the operators U(t) \u2261 eiH t Ue\u2212iH t , \u0168(t) \u2261 eiH t \u0168e\u2212iH\n(n,m)\n\n(147)\n\n\u03c8P,f\n\n(q) =\n\n(\u2212i)n (\u2212i)m\nn!\nm!\n\nZ0\n\nF\n\nt\n\nas\n\ndt1 . . .dtn dt\u03031 . . . dt\u0303m \u00d7\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0,0)\n\u00d7 T U(t1 ) . . .

Meromorphic continuation\n\nTo start with, one may consider the case \u2212b < R(\u03b1) < 0. The natural ansatz for defining the\nanalytic continuation of the representation (144) for the matrix element hP2 , f2 |[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)|P1 , f1 i\nwould be\nZ \u221e\nhP2 , f2 |[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)|P1 , f1 i = lim\ndq h \u03c8P2 ,f2 (q) | [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304) , \u03c8P1 ,f1 (q) iH(q)\nq0 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(148)\n\n+\n\nq0\n\ne2i((1\u22122s1 )P1 \u2212(1\u22122s2 )P2 \u2212i\u03b1)q0\n\u00d7\n2i((1 \u2212 2s1 )P1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2s2 )P2 \u2212 i\u03b1)\ns1 ,s2 =0,1\n!\n\u0001\n2\u03b1\u03c6\u0304\ns1\ns2\n\u00d7 R (P2 )f2 , : e (z, z\u0304) : R (P1 )f1 F \u2297F ,\nX\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0304 \u2261 \u03c6 \u2212 q.

One thereby\nfinds poles for\n(149)\n\n\u03b1 + i(s1 P1 \u2212 s2 P2 ) = \u2212nb \u2212 mb\u22121 ,\n\ns1 , s2 = \u00b11;\n\nn, m \u2208 Z\u22650 ,\n\nin precise correspondence with the poles of the matrix element hP2 , f2 |[e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (z, z\u0304)|P1 , f1 i as given\nby the DOZZ-proposal. Moreover, by some arguments that are familiar from standard derivations of\nquantum field theoretical perturbation theory one finds that the corresponding residues are precisely\ngiven by the Dotsenko-Fateev integrals that were discussed in Part I.\n\n12. DISCUSSION\n\n\f-4512.1. The success\nOur attempt to understand Liouville theory in terms of the zero mode Sch\u00f6dinger representation\n(109) was in some respects amazingly successful:\n(1) It gave a natural interpretation of the reflection property |P i = R(P )| \u2212 P i in terms of\nreflection of wave-packets from a potential-\"wall\".\n(2) The Seiberg-bound followed from the fact that wave-packets get pushed out to q \u2192 \u2212\u221e for\ntime t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e: If the exponential [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b decays too strongly for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e it can not have\nany overlap with the asymptotic wave-packets.\n(3) Considering the asymptotic expansion of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nallowed one to get a detailed understanding of the analytic properties of matrix elements\nsuch as hP \u2032 |V\u03b1 (z)|P i (location of poles, residues, reflection property), in perfect agreement\nwith the DOZZ-proposal.\n12.2. Problems\n(1) Let us recall that the DOZZ-proposal requires that\n\u0013b\u22122\n\u0012\n\u0393(b2 )\n\u0393(b\u22122 )\n.\n= \u03c0\u03bc\n\u03c0 \u03bc\u0303\n\u0393(1 \u2212 b\u22122 )\n\u0393(1 \u2212 b2 )\nFor 0 < b < 1 one may observe that there exist certain ranges for the values of b where not\nboth of \u03bc and \u03bc\u0303 can be positive: \u0393(1 \u2212 b\u22122 ) may become negative. However, in such a case\nit seems impossible to have positivity of H: One could always find regions in q-space where\nthe interaction term \u03bcU + \u03bc\u0303\u0168 gives negative contributions to HF\n\u03bc\u03bc\u0303 , which would contradict\nthe positivity of H.\n(2) The asymptotic expansion (146) can be rewritten in terms of (HF \u2212 EP,f )\u22121 U, (HF \u2212\nEP,f )\u22121 \u0168. If (146) would provide a valid representation for \u03c8P,f (q) at finite values\nof q, one would not understand how \u03c8P,f (q) could have the nice analytic properties in\nits P -dependence that are suggested by the correspondence with |P, fi: The operators\n(HF \u2212 EP,f )\u22121 would introduce an awkward collection of poles for complex P .\nF\nF\n(3) If H = HF\n\u03bc\u03bc\u0303 one would of course also need to have Ln \u2261 Ln,\u03bc,\u03bc\u0303 and L\u0304n \u2261 L\u0304n,\u03bc,\u03bc\u0303 . In this case\n2\u03b1\u03c6\n2\u03b1\u03c6(\u03c3)\nnothing would prevent us to identify [e ]b (\u03c3) \u2261: e\n:. But this would be inconsistent\nwith the Seiberg bound as discussed in Subsection 11.2.\n12.3. What to conclude?\nThe description of Liouville theory in a representation such as (109) where the zero mode q is\ndiagonal works very well as long as only the asymptotics q \u2192 \u2212\u221e is considered. We conclude\nthat one has H \u223c HSchr and H \u223c HF\n\u03bc\u03bc\u0303 up to corrections that vanish faster than any exponential for\nq \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This is good enough to support the picture of Liouville dynamics as describing scattering\nof wave-packets off some perfectly reflecting \"potential\".\nAll the problems that we have mentioned have to do with the representation of Liouville theory\n\"at finite q\". The latter fact may not be too surprising in view of our remarks in Subsections 8.3 and\n9.1. But what precisely goes wrong? Let us just point out two options that one might consider:\n\n\f-46(1) There exists a self-adjoint zero mode operator q, but it has a spectral representation that is\nless trivial than (109):\nZ\nd\u03bc(q) H(q),\nH \u2243 HSchr =\nR\n\nwhere H(q) must not be a Fock-representation of the canonical commutation relations for an ,\nbn . This would of course also render the representation of H in HSchr nontrivial. However,\nmaking contact with the DOZZ-proposal would require that H(q) is at least weakly asymptotic to F \u2297 F for q \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Moreover, possible q-dependent quantum corrections in the\ndefinition of H(q) and H would have to vanish faster than any exponential.\n(2) The zero mode operator q does not exist, is not densely defined, or ceases to be selfadjoint\nfor other reasons. In this case one would seem to loose any ground for describing Liouville\ntheory in terms of wave-packets localized in target space.

OPERATOR-APPROACH\n13. CLASSICAL INTEGRABILITY\nClassically one standard way of exhibiting the complete integrability of the Liouville equation is\nbased on the following observation:\n13.1. Linear system\nClaim: The following statements are equivalent:\n(i) \u03c6 satisfies the classical Liouville equation of motion\n\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c6 = \u22122\u03c0\u03bcc e\u03c6\n(ii) e\n\n\u2212 12 \u03c6\n\nsatisfies\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2 \u2212 2 \u03c6(x+ ,x\u2212 )\n= T++ (x+ )e\u2212 2 \u03c6(x+ ,x\u2212 )\n\u2202+\ne\n\n(150)\n\n2 \u2212 2 \u03c6(x+ ,x\u2212 )\n\u2202\u2212\ne\n= T\u2212\u2212 (x\u2212 )e\u2212 2 \u03c6(x+ ,x\u2212 ) ,\n\nwhere T++ (resp. T\u2212\u2212 ) depend on x+ (resp. x\u2212 ) only.\nProof. - (i)\u21d2(ii):\nAny \u03c6(x+ , x\u2212 ) will satisfy (150) with\nT\u00b1\u00b1 (x+ , x\u2212 ) \u2261\n\n2\n1\n4 (\u2202\u00b1 \u03c6)\n\n2\n\u2212 21 \u2202\u00b1\n\u03c6.\n\nHowever, direct calculation shows that \u2202\u2213 T\u00b1\u00b1 = 0 if the Liouville equation of motion is satisfied.\n(ii)\u21d2(i):\nEquation (150) implies that\n1\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03c6(x+ ,x\u2212 ) =\n\n(151)\n\n2\nX\n\nfi+ (x+ )Cij fj\u2212 (x\u2212 ),\n\ni,j=1\n\nfi\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ),\n\n2 \u00b1\nwhere\ni = 1, 2 are two linearly independent real solutions of \u2202\u00b1\nfi = T\u00b1\u00b1 fi\u00b1 , which can\nand will be normalized such that\n\n(152)\n\nf2\u00b1 \u2202\u00b1 f1\u00b1 \u2212 f1\u00b1 \u2202\u00b1 f2\u00b1 = 1.\n\nIt is no loss of generality to assume that Cij = C\u03b4ij in (151) since this may always be achieved by\nforming suitable linear combinations of the fi\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ), i = 1, 2. By direct calculation using (152) one\nmay then verify that\n!\n2\nX\np\n(153)\nfi+ (x+ )fi\u2212 (x\u2212 )\n\u03c6(x+ , x\u2212 ) = \u22122 log\n2\u03c0\u03bcc\ni=1\n\nsatisfies the Liouville equation of motion.\n\nThis means that the solution of the nonlinear Liouville equation of motion can be reduced to the\nintegration of the linear equation (150), where T\u00b1\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) can be considered as data, given in terms\n1\nof either initial or asymptotic conditions.5 From these one may then reconstruct e\u2212 2 \u03c6(x+ ,x\u2212 ) by\n5 See\n\n[PP] for the solution of the initial value problem.\n\n\f-48solving linear differential equations, and finally \u03c6 itself by taking the logarithm. Any solution of the\nLiouville equation is obtained in this way, and the data T\u00b1\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) characterize a solution \u03c6(x+ , x\u2212 )\nuniquely up to an additive constant.\n\n13.2. Boundary conditions\nWe are interested in the case where \u03c6(\u03c3, t) is periodic, \u03c6(\u03c3 + 2\u03c0, t) = \u03c6(\u03c3, t). It follows that\nT\u00b1\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) must also be periodic. However, the solutions fi\u00b1 will only be quasi-periodic\n(154)\n\nf \u00b1 (x\u00b1 \u00b1 2\u03c0) = M \u00b1 * f \u00b1 (x\u00b1 ),\n\nwhere we used matrix notation, f \u00b1 being the transpose of the row vector (f1\u00b1 , f2\u00b1 ). The monodromy\nmatrices M \u00b1 must be elements of SL(2, R) in order for (154) to be consistent with (152). Periodicity of \u03c6(\u03c3, t) therefore requires that (M + )t *M \u2212 = 1. The Liouville field (153) is clearly unchanged\nunder the transformations\n(155)\n\nf \u00b1 \u2192 A\u00b1 f \u00b1 ,\n\n(A+ )t * A\u2212 = 1,\n\nunder which M transforms as M \u00b1 \u2192 A\u00b1 *M \u00b1 *(A\u00b1 )\u22121 . The Liouville field therefore only depends\non the conjugacy class of the matrix M . It can be shown [PP] that the Liouville field is regular if\nand only if TrM > 2, corresponding to the so-called hyperbolic conjugacy classes of SL(2, R).\np\np\nBy means of (155) one may then always bring M into the form M = diag(e 2 , e\u2212 2 ). We will\nhenceforth assume M to be of that form.\n\n13.3. Map to free field\nAnother useful representation of the general solution to the Liouville equation is obtained by\nintroducing\n(156)\n\nA\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) \u2261 f2 (x\u00b1 )/f1 (x\u00b1 ).\n\nNote that the normalization conditions (152) imply that A\u00b1 are monotonic, i.e. \u2202\u00b1 A\u00b1 = (f1\u00b1 )\u22122 >\n0. It is therefore possible to recover fi\u00b1 via\n(157)\n\n1\n\nf1\u00b1 = (\u2202\u00b1 A\u00b1 )\u2212 2\n\n1\n\nf2\u00b1 = (\u2202\u00b1 A\u00b1 )\u2212 2 A\u00b1 ,\n\nwhich leads to the following classical representation for the Liouville field:\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\n\u2202+ A+ \u2202\u2212 A\u2212\n\u03c6(x+ , x\u2212 ) = log\n(158)\n.\n2\u03c0\u03bcc\n(1 + A+ A\u2212 )2\n\nHowever, it turns out that the data A\u00b1 are not very convenient as starting point for quantization:\nTheir Poisson brackets are complicated [PP] and it is not easy to realize the condition of monotonicity on the quantum level. The following variables appear to be better suited: Define \u03c6F\n\u00b1 (x\u00b1 )\nby\n(159)\n\nF\n\ne\u03c6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) \u2261 \u2202\u00b1 A\u00b1 .\n\n\f-49F\nThe quasi-periodicity of A\u00b1 implies that \u03c6F (x+ , x\u2212 ) \u2261 \u03c6F\n+ (x+ ) + \u03c6\u2212 (x\u2212 ) is a solution of the free\nF\nwave equation \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c6 = 0 on the cylinder. It is easy to see that A\u00b1 (and therefore the Liouville\nfield itself) can be recovered from \u03c6F\n\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) by means of\n\n(160)\n\n1\nA\u00b1 [\u03c6 ](x\u00b1 ) = \u00b1p\ne \u22121\nF\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\nF\n\ndy\u00b1 e\u03c6\u00b1 (y\u00b1 +x\u00b1 ) .\n\n0\n\nThese considerations yield a map from the phase space P F into the phase space P of Liouville\ntheory.\nThere is a problem, though: The map P F \u2192 P is not one-to-one but two-to-one. For any given\nF\nsolution \u03c6F\n1 (x+ , x\u2212 ) of the free field wave equation there exists a second one \u03c62 (x+ , x\u2212 ) that\nmaps to the same solution of the Liouville equation. This is most easily verified by noting that\n(158) is unchanged if one replaces A\u00b1 \u2192 1/A\u00b1 , which corresponds to the exchange of f1\u00b1 and\nF\nf2\u00b1 . The second free field configuration \u03c6F\n2 (x+ , x\u2212 ) is therefore given in terms of \u03c61 (x+ , x\u2212 ) \u2261\nF\nF\n\u03c61,+ (x+ ) + \u03c61,\u2212 (x\u2212 ) via\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n(161)\n.\n\u2202\n\u03c6F\n(x\n,\nx\n)\n=\nlog\n\u2202\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2\nA+ [\u03c61 ] A\u2212 [\u03c61 ]\nThe resulting map P F \u2192 P F will be denoted by S.\nIn order to get a unique parametrization of the Liouville phase space in terms of free field variables\none therefore has two obvious options: Either one may note that S maps the zero mode p which is\nrecovered from \u03c6F as\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\np=\nd\u03c3 \u2202t \u03c6F\n2\u03c0 0\nF\ninto its negative. The map P F \u2192 P is therefore invertible when restricted e.g. to the subspaces P\u00b1\nF\ndefined by the condition \u00b1p > 0. The corresponding maps P \u2192 P\u00b1\nwill be denoted W\u00b1 . But it\nF\nF\nmay sometimes be more convenient to think of P+ as P /\u223c, where two configurations \u03c6F\ni (x+ , x\u2212 )\nF\ni = 1, 2 are considered as equivalent (notation: \u03c6F\n\u223c\n\u03c6\n)\niff\nS[\u03c6\n]\n=\n\u03c6\n.\n1\n2\n1\n2\nThe importance of this \"gauge symmetry\" represented by the map S was emphasized by Gervais\nand Neveu. We will identify its proper quantum counterpart below.\n\n13.4. Canonical formalism\nWe had introduced the canonical formalism for Liouville theory in section 8.1. Its counterpart for\nthe free field \u03c6F is obviously obtained by replacing \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6F and setting \u03bcc = 0. A basic result that\nrepresents important motivation for the program of constructing quantum Liouville theory in terms\nof the quantized free field is the following:\nF\nThe maps W\u00b1 : P \u2192 P\u00b1\nare canonical. More precisely: The canonical Poisson bracket relations\n(162)\n\n{\u03a0\u03c6 (\u03c3), \u03c6(\u03c3 \u2032 )} = \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 )\n\nimply the same commutation relations for the images \u03c6F , \u03a0F\n\u03c6 of \u03c6, \u03a0\u03c6 under W\u00b1 . Conversely:\nCanonical Poisson bracket relations\n(163)\n\nF \u2032\n\u2032\n{\u03a0F\n\u03c6 (\u03c3), \u03c6 (\u03c3 )} = \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 )\n\n\f-50imply (162).\nThe inverse direction (163) \u21d2 (162) can be shown by direct, but tedious calculation (see e.g. [KN]\nfor details). To go from (162) \u21d2 to (163) is more difficult, see [PP]. It also follows that the map\nS : P F \u2192 P F will be canonical.\n13.5. Conformal symmetry\nIt is quite important to note that the integrable structure of Liouville theory (as represented by the\nF\nmaps W\u00b1 : P \u2192 P\u00b1\n) is compatible with conformal symmetry: Let us first remark that canonical\ngenerators of conformal transformations in the free field theory are easily identified as\n2 F\nF\n\u03c6 .\nT\u00b1\u00b1\n= 41 (\u2202\u00b1 \u03c6F )2 \u2212 21 \u2202\u00b1\n\n(164)\nThe modes ln\u00b1 =\nalgebra:\n(165)\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nR 2\u03c0\n0\n\nF\nd\u03c3ein\u03c3 T\u00b1\u00b1\n(\u03c3) will then satisfy a Poisson-counterpart of the Virasoro\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n{ln\u00b1 , lm\n} = i(n \u2212 m)ln+m\n+ 2i n3 \u03b4n+m .\n\nCompatibility of conformal symmetry with the integrable structure of Liouville theory is a conF\nF\nsequence of the fact that the maps W\u00b1 : P \u2192 P\u00b1\nindeed transform T\u00b1\u00b1 [\u03c6] into T\u00b1\u00b1\n[\u03c6F ] [PP].\nIt follows in particular that the maps W\u00b1 intertwine the actions of conformal symmetry generated\nF\nby T\u00b1\u00b1\nand T\u00b1\u00b1 respectively. A check of this statement may be based on the observation that fi\u00b1\nF\ni = 1, 2 transform under the conformal transformations generated by T\u00b1\u00b1\nas tensors of weight 21 :\n(166)\n\nF\n{T\u00b1\u00b1\n, fi\u00b1 (x\u00b1 )} = einx\u00b1 (\u2202\u00b1 \u2212 in 21 )fi\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ).\n\nClosely related is the fact that the map S : P F \u2192 P F commutes with the action of conformal\nF\nsymmetry as generated by T\u00b1\u00b1\n. Very similar considerations for the case of Liouville theory on the\nstrip have first appeared in [GN0].\n\n14. QUANTIZATION OF THE FREE FIELD THEORY\nGiven the possibility to map classical Liouville theory to a free field theory it is of course natural\nto approach quantization of Liouville theory by first quantizing the free field theory and then trying\nto reconstruct the Liouville field operators in terms of operators in the free field theory.\nSo let us introduce the free field \u03c6F (\u03c3, t) with canonical commutation relations\n(167)\n\n[\u03c6F (\u03c3), \u2202t \u03c6F (\u03c3)] = 2\u03c0i\u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 )\n\nat time t = 0.

We will work in a representation where P is diagonal.\n\n\f-5114.1.

Reflection operator\nWe had found in our discussion of the classical integrability of the Liouville equation that the\nfree field with unrestricted zero mode p parameterizes the Liouville field in an ambiguous way:\nThere exists a transformation S (defined in (161)) of free field configurations \u03c6F (t, \u03c3) that leaves\nthe Liouville field unchanged. When using the free field phase space P F as a parameterization of\nthe space of solutions to the Liouville equation one should therefore identify any two configurations\nF\nF\nF\nof the free field that are related by S: \u03c6F\n1 \u223c \u03c62 iff S[\u03c61 ] = \u03c62 .\nIn the quantization scheme that we have discussed so far, we have started from a realization of\nthe zero mode p with spectrum being the entire real line. The quantum analogue of S should be an\noperator S on HF that maps p to \u2212p but leaves [e\u2212b\u03c6 ]b unchanged,\n(181)\n\nS\u22121 * [e\u2212b\u03c6 ]b * S = [e\u2212b\u03c6 ]b .\n\nThis operator can be considered as expressing the ambiguity in the parameterization of Liouville\nstates by free field variables on the quantum level. The true Liouville Hilbert H space should then\nbe identified with the subspace in HF of S-invariant vectors. For the identification of H with a\nsubspace in HF to be compatible with conformal symmetry one evidently needs that S commutes\nwith the Virasoro generators,\n(182)\n\nF\nS * LF\nn (p) = Ln (\u2212p) * S,\n\nF\nS * L\u0304F\nn (p) = L\u0304n (\u2212p) * S.\n\nSuch an operator can be constructed as follows: Since the Fock-space representations FP and F\u2212P\nare unitarily equivalent (cf. Subsection 10.6) one has a unique operator S(P ) : F \u2297 F \u2192 F \u2297 F\nthat satisfies (182) and S(P )\u03a9 = \u03a9. The sought-for operator S must therefore be of the form\n(183)\n\nS = P * R(p)S(p),\n\nwhere P denotes the parity operation in L2 (R) \u2297 F \u2297 F, P\u03c8(P ) = \u03c8(\u2212P ). One may then show\nthat there exists a unique choice of the function R(P ) that was introduced in (183) such that (181)\nis satisfied as well. This choice is given as\n\u0001\u2212 2iP\n\u0393(1 + 2ibP )\u0393(1 + 2ib\u22121 P )\nb\n(184)\n,\nR(P ) = \u2212 \u03bce \u03932 (b2 )\n\u0393(1 \u2212 2ibP )\u0393(1 \u2212 2ib\u22121 P )\nwhich coincides with the reflection amplitude R(P ) obtained from the DOZZ-proposal if we identify\nthe constant \u03bce introduced in the definition (179) of V with the constant \u03bc that appears in the DOZZformula via \u03bce = \u03bc sin(\u03c0b2 ).\nBy means of S we may now identify the Liouville Hilbert space H as\n(185)\n\nH = {|\u03c8i \u2208 HF ; (1 \u2212 S)\u03a8 = 0}.\n\n\f-5415. GENERAL EXPONENTIAL OPERATORS\nLet us start by reconsidering the classical expression for e\u03bb\u03c6 which may be written in terms of fs\u00b1\nas (cf. (153))\n\u0001\u22122\u03bb\n(186)\n.\ne\u03bb\u03c6(\u03c3,t) = f1+ f1\u2212 + 2\u03c0\u03bcc f2+ f2\u2212\n\nLet us note that at least for \u03bb > 0 one has a useful representation of (186) as sum of imaginary\npowers of fi+ fi\u2212 :\nZ\ni\n\u0393(s + 2\u03bb)\u0393(\u2212s) + \u2212 \u0001s + \u2212 \u0001\u22122\u03bb\u2212s\n\u03bb\u03c6(\u03c3,t)\ne\n=\n(187)\nf2 f2\nf1 f1\n.\nds (2\u03c0\u03bcc )s\n2\u03c0\n\u0393(2\u03bb)\niR\n\nThis expansion is related to the binomial expansion by writing the integral as sum over residues.\nHowever, it has the advantage to be valid both for f1+ f1\u2212 > f2+ f2\u2212 and f1+ f1\u2212 < f2+ f2\u2212 , which is\nimportant for quantization:\nThe essential point is captured by the following example: Consider the operator v\u03bb of multipliq\nq\ncation by the function h\u03bb (q) \u2261 (e 2 + e\u2212 2 )\u22122\u03bb on L2 (R) in the case that R(\u03bb) > 0. v\u03bb is a nice,\nbounded operator on L2 (R) since h\u03bb (q) behaves asymptotically as h\u03bb (q) \u223c e\u2212\u03bb|q| . Now let us try\nto represent this operator by using the usual binomial expansion:\nv\u03bb = e\u03bbq\n\n(188)\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212)n \u0393(n + 2\u03bb) nq\ne\n\u0393(2\u03bb)\u0393(n + 1)\nn=0\n\nwhich clearly can represent the operator on wave-functions with support on the negative half-axis\nonly. The domain in which (188) serves to represent the operator v\u03bb is not even dense in L2 (R)!\nThis problem does not occur if one uses the integral version (187) of the binomial expansion. By\nmeans of a shift of the contour of integration one may even write it as an expansion over the unitary\noperators eitbq .\n15.1. Definition\nWe would like to define [e2\u03b1\u03c6 ]b (\u03c3) as something like [e\u2212b\u03c6 ]b \u2261 V raised to the power \u22122\u03b1. This\nis of course a nontrivial thing to do in the case of local operators. One may, however, recall that\nthe usual exponential function is the unique solution to the functional equation exp(x) exp(y) =\nexp(x + y) within the class of continuous functions. This motivates the following definition:\nD EFINITION 1. - Let V\u03b1 (\u03c3) be a family of operators that has the properties\ni) There exists a complex number \u03c1 such that\n\u0001\n\u03c1\n\u03c3 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c3 V\u03b1 (\u03c3 \u2032 )V\u03b2 (\u03c3)\nV\u03b1 \u22c6 V\u03b2 (\u03c3) \u2261 lim\n\u2032\n\u03c3 \u2192\u03c3\n\nexists and satisfies\n\n\u0001\nV\u03b1 \u22c6 V\u03b2 (\u03c3) = V\u03b1+\u03b2 (\u03c3).\n\nii) Each two operators V\u03b1 (\u03c3) and V\u03b2 (\u03c3) are mutually local:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nV\u03b1 (\u03c3 \u2032 ) , V\u03b2 (\u03c3) = 0.\n\niii) V\u03b1 (\u03c3) reduces to V(\u03c3) for \u03b1 = \u2212 2b .\n\n\f-55We then call V\u03b1 (\u03c3) a renormalized power function of V, in symbols V\u03b1 (\u03c3) \u2261 V\u22122\u03b1 (\u03c3).\nIt turns out that there there exists a family of operators V\u03b1 (\u03c3) that fulfills these properties. This\nfamily V\u03b1 (\u03c3) can be shown to be unique at least for irrational b \u2208 (0, 1). It will be constructed by\nan expression similar to (187) out of building blocks that can be considered as quantum analogs of\n(f2+ )is (f1+ )\u22122\u03bb\u2212is and (f2\u2212 )is (f1\u2212 )\u22122\u03bb\u2212is , which will be introduced in the next subsection.\n15.2. Covariant chiral operators\nWe will define operators fs\u03b1 (x+ ), f\u0304s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) in the spirit of Definition 1 such that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1\u2212 b\n\u03b1\u2212 b\nf\u03041 \u22c6 f\u0304s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) = f\u0304s 2 (x\u2212 ),\nfs\u03b1 \u22c6 f1 (x+ ) = fs 2 (x+ ),\n(189)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1\u2212 b\n\u03b1\u2212 b\nf2 \u22c6 fs\u03b1 (x+ ) = fs+12 (x+ ),\nf\u0304s\u03b1 \u22c6 f\u03042 (x\u2212 ) = f\u0304s+12 (x\u2212 ).\nThe operators fs\u03b1 (x+ ), f\u0304s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) can be represented explicitly as follows:\n\u0001s\nSb (Q \u2212 2ip)\nb\nQ(x+ ) E\u03b1 (x+ ),\nfs\u03b1 (x+ ) \u2261 e\u22122\u03c0bs(p+i 2 )\nSb (Q \u2212 2ip + bs)\n(190)\n\u0001s Sb (Q + 2ip)\nb\nf\u0304s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) \u2261 \u0112\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) Q\u0304(x\u2212 )\ne\u22122\u03c0bs(p\u2212i 2 ) ,\nSb (Q + 2ip + bs)\nwhere the special function Sb (x) is defined as\n\nSb (x) = \u0393b (x)/\u0393b (Q \u2212 x).\n\n(191)\n\nLet us observe that the definition (190) makes sense for complex values of s due to the positivity\nof Q. The operators fs\u03b1 (x+ ), f\u0304s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) transform under conformal symmetry the same way as the\noperators E\u03b1 (x+ ), \u0112\u03b1 (x\u2212 ), cf. (174).\n\u0001s\nIt is technically often more convenient to work with the operators gs\u03b1 (x+ ) = E\u03b1 (x+ ) Q(x+ ) ,\n\u0001\ns\n\u1e21s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) = \u0112\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) Q\u0304(x\u2212 ) , which are related to fs\u03b1 (x+ ), f\u0304s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) by multiplication with a pdependent factor. The following two results are the main technical ingredients to our proof of the\nDOZZ-proposal, the details of which will appear in [TO].\nN ORMALIZATION\nThe matrix elements of operators gs\u03b1 between primary states for the Virasoro\nalgebra are given as\n\u0001\n\u2032\n(192)\nhP \u2032 |gs\u03b1 (x+ )|P i = \u03b4 Ps\u03b1 \u2212 P \u2032 eix+ (\u2206(P )\u2212\u2206(P )) G\u03b1\ns (P ),\nwhere Ps\u03b1 \u2261 P \u2212 i\u03b1 \u2212 ibs and\n\u0011s\n\u0010\n2 2\n2 \u22121\u2212b2\nG\u03b1\ne2\u03c0bsP e\u2212\u03c0ib s\ns (P ) = \u0393(1 + b )b\n(193)\n\u0393b (Q \u2212 2iP \u2212 2\u03b1 \u2212 sb)\u0393b (Q + 2iP + sb) \u0393b (Q \u2212 2\u03b1 \u2212 sb)\u0393b (Q + sb)\n.\n\u00d7\n\u0393b (Q \u2212 2iP \u2212 2\u03b1 \u2212 2sb)\u0393b (Q + 2iP )\n\u0393b (Q \u2212 2\u03b1)\u0393b (Q)\nThe corresponding formula for \u1e21s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) is obtained by simply replacing gs\u03b1 \u2192 \u1e21s\u03b1 and x+ \u2192 x\u2212 .\nThe operators gs\u03b1 satisfy braid relations of the form\nB RAID RELATIONS\nZ\n1\ngs\u03b122 (\u03c32 )gs\u03b111 (\u03c31 ) =\ndt2 dt1 gt\u03b111 (\u03c31 )gt\u03b122 (\u03c32 ) B\u01eb (\u03b12 , \u03b11 |p)st22ts11 ,\n(194)\n4\nT\n\n+ iR and \u01eb \u2261 sgn(\u03c32 \u2212 \u03c31 ).

Powers of V\nLet us now consider the operator\nV\u03b1 (t, \u03c3) \u2261\n\n(195)\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1\nds \u03bcse Bb (\u03b1, s) fs\u03b1 (x+ ) T\u03b1\ns f\u0304s (x\u2212 ),\n\niR\n\nwhere\n\nT\u03b1\ns\n\n\u2261e\n\n\u22122(\u03b1+bs)q\n\n(196)\n\nand the b-binomial coefficients Bb (\u03b1, s) are given by\nBb (\u03b1, s) =\n\nSb (\u2212bs)Sb (2\u03b1 + bs)\n.\nSb (2\u03b1)\n\nV\u03b1 (t, \u03c3) is clearly a primary field for the left- and right Virasoro algebras generated by Ln , L\u0304n . The\nmain result of [TO] will be that V\u03b1 (\u03c3) \u2261 V\u03b1 (t = 0, \u03c3) is indeed a renormalized power of V in the\nsense of Definition 1. The least trivial part of this statement is of course the verification of mutual\nlocality, which becomes possible thanks to the existence of the braid relations (194). We will outline\nin the following Part IV how this verification can be done using the explicit calculation of the kernel\nB\u01eb (\u03b12 , \u03b11 |p)st22ts11 in Section 16 below.\nThe matrix elements of V\u03b1 can be assembled from (193), (189) and (195). By identifying \u03bce =\n\u03bc sin(\u03c0b2 ) one finds that\n\u0001\nQ\n(197)\nhP2 |V\u03b1 (0)|P1 i = C Q\n2 \u2212 iP2 , \u03b1, 2 + iP1 ,\n\nwhere C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) is the DOZZ three point function. It follows that the operators V\u03b1 are indeed\nidentical to those discussed in Part I.\nLet us also note that S * V\u03b1 (x) * S\u22121 = V\u03b1 (x) as a consequence of the reflection property of the\nDOZZ three point function. This means in particular that V\u03b1 (x) leaves the Liouville Hilbert-space\nH invariant.\n15.4. Related work\n\nThe operator approach to Liouville theory based on the quantization of the classical map to a free\nfield has a long tradition going back to [BCT1][BCT2],[GN1][GN2] and [OW]. We should therefore\ndiscuss the relations between the treatment given here to the results of these works.\nThe approach taken in this paper is close in spirit to the approach of Gervais and Neveu, which was\noriginally developed for Liouville theory on a strip instead of the cylinder. Subsequent work aimed\nat the development of this approach for Liouville theory on the cylinder includes [LS][GS3] and\nreferences therein. These works are concerned with the construction of field operators in a space of\nstates called the \"elliptic sector\" which in our notation would be generated by states |P i with purely\nimaginary values of P . One needs to note, however, that the elliptic sector unavoidably contains\nnon-unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra [LS] and that exponential field operators must\nhave unusual hermiticity properties if such a spectrum is assumed [LS][BP][GS3]. Unfortunately we\ncould not find a treatment of the so-called hyperbolic sector (generated by |P i with P \u2208 R) in the\nspirit of Gervais and Neveu. Moreover, we do not know how to employ the results of [GS3] for the\nconstruction of general exponential operators in the hyperbolic sector that is studied in this paper.\nThe approaches of [BCT1][BCT2] and [OW] on the other hand were in fact devoted to the hyperbolic sector. However, it was not obvious to us how to define and calculate the matrix elements of\ngeneral exponential operators from the results of these references. The points where it is possible\n\n\f-57to compare the results of [BCT1][BCT2] and [OW] to the consequences of the DOZZ-proposal as\ndiscussed in Part I are therefore somewhat limited.6 We would like to mention, however, that the\nnecessity to restrict to \"half\" of the free field space of states in the scheme of [BCT1][BCT2] was\nalso observed in [BCGT], but the relation with the reflection operator R(P ) was not discussed there.\n\n16. APPENDIX: BRAIDING OF COVARIANT CHIRAL OPERATORS\nWe would like to outline the derivation of the key fact that the operators gs\u03b1 (x+ ), \u1e21s\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) satisfy\nbraid relations of the form (194). More details will be given in [TO]. In the following we will mainly\nQ\nQ\nconsider the case \u03b1i \u2208 Q\n2 + iR, si \u2208 \u2212 2 + iR, ti \u2208 \u2212 2 + iR, i = 1, 2. The braid relations in the\ngeneral case can be obtained by analytic continuation.\n16.1. Reformulation in terms of Weyl-type operators\nThe starting point of our calculation will be the following nice trick introduced in [GS1]. We\nwill only consider the case \u03c32 < \u03c31 \u2194 \u01eb = \u22121 explicitly in the following, the other case being\ncompletely analogous. Let us split Q(\u03c3) = QcI + QI , Q(\u03c3 \u2032 ) = QcI + Q\u2032I , where\n(198)\n\nQcI \u2261\n\n\u03c3+2\u03c0\nZ\n\nd\u03c6 Eb (\u03c6),\n\nQI \u2261\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\nZ\u03c3\u2032\n\nd\u03c6 Eb (\u03c6),\n\nQ\u2032I \u2261\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2032\n\u03c3Z\n+2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6 Eb (\u03c6).\n\n\u03c3+2\u03c0\n\nIt follows from the exchange relations\nE\u03b12 (\u03c32 )E\u03b11 (\u03c31 ) = e\u22122\u03c0i\u03b12 \u03b11 \u01eb(\u03c32 \u2212\u03c31 ) E\u03b11 (\u03c31 )E\u03b12 (\u03c32 ),\n\n(199)\n\nwhere \u01eb(\u03c3) = 1 if \u03c3 > 0 and \u01eb(\u03c3) = \u22121 if \u03c3 < 0, that (194) is equivalent to the following identity:\n\u0001s1\n\u0001s2 c\n=\nQI + Q\u2032I\ne4\u03c0i\u03b12 \u03b11 e\u22122\u03c0ib\u03b11 QcI + e2\u03c0ib\u03b11 QI\nZ\n\u0001t2\n\u0001t1 c\n(200)\nB\u2212 (\u03b12 , \u03b11 |p)st22ts11 .\nQI + QI\n=\ndt2 dt1 e\u22122\u03c0ib\u03b12 QcI + e\u22126\u03c0ib\u03b12 Q\u2032I\nT\n\nThe operators\n\nQI , Q\u2032I ,\n\nQcI satisfy the following algebra:\nQcI QI = q \u22122 QI QcI ,\n\n(201)\n\nQcI Q\u2032I = q +2 Q\u2032I QcI ,\n\nQI Q\u2032I = q 4 Q\u2032I QI ,\n\n2\n\nwhere q = e\u03c0ib . It follows that these operators can be realized as\n(202)\n\nQcI = e2bx e\u2212\u03c0ibt ,\n\nQI = ebx e\u22122\u03c0bp ebx e\u03c0ibt ,\n\nwhere x and p satisfy the commutation relations [x, p] =\n\ni\n2\n\nQ\u2032I = ebx e2\u03c0bp ebx e\u03c0ibt ,\n\nand t \u2208 iR commutes with x and p.\n\n6 These include comparison of certain structure functions related to the cases for the three point functions that are calculable in terms of Dotsenko-Fateev integrals (cf. part I). A detailed comparison of such data as obtained from [BCT1][BCT2],\n[GN1][GN2] and [OW] was carried out in [GS2], where mutual consistency of these results was found.\n\n\f-5816.2.

CHIRAL BOOTSTRAP\nIn this part we would like to explain how Liouville theory fits into a \"chiral bootstrap\" formalism similar to the one developed by Moore and Seiberg [MS] for rational conformal field theories\n(see [FFK] for a very similar formalism). Such a formalism is useful to gain further insight into\nthe mathematics that is behind the consistency of Liouville theory, like fusion of unitary Virasoro\nrepresentations, and the connection with quantum group representation theory [PT1]. It furthermore\nprovides a convenient framework for completing the proof of locality and crossing symmetry of operators V\u03b1 that are characterized by the DOZZ three-point function. Let us finally note that having\nsuch a formulation is important when trying to construct Liouville theory with conformally invariant\nboundary conditions by means of a formalism that resembles the one introduced in [BPPZ][FFFS]\nfor rational conformal field theories in the presence of boundaries.\n\n17.

We will denote VA (z) \u2261 VAN \u22611 (z). Knowing\nVA (z) is good enough since VAN (z) = N(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 )VA (z).\nR EMARK 7. - The variable z is to be considered as a formal variable for the moment: VA (z) is\nconsidered as a generating device for a collection of maps VA (k) : V\u03b11 [n] \u2192 V\u03b13 [n + k] via\nX\nVA (z) = z \u2206\u03b13 \u2212\u2206\u03b12 \u2212\u2206\u03b11\n(210)\nz k VA (k).\nk\u2208Z\n\nSimilar remarks will apply to the generalizations of the operators VA (z) that we will introduce in\nthe rest of this section. This should be kept in mind as we will not present a formalism that makes\nthe \"formal\" interpretation of chiral vertex operators mathematically precise.\nIt is often convenient to generalize the VA (z) by introducing a family of operators VA (\u03be|z) called\ndescendants of VA (z) that are indexed by an element \u03be \u2208 V\u03b12 . The operators VA (\u03be|z) are defined in\nterms of VA (z) by means of VA (v\u03b12 |z) \u2261 VA (z), VA (L\u22121 \u03b6|z) = \u2202z VA (\u03b6|z) and\n1\n: (\u2202zn\u22122 T (z))VA (\u03b6|z) :,\n(n \u2212 2)!\nX\nX\n: T (w)VA (\u03b6|z) : \u2261\nw\u2212n\u22122 Ln VA (\u03b6|z) + VA (\u03b6|z)\nw\u2212n\u22122 Ln .\n\nVA (L\u2212n \u03b6|z) =\n(211)\n\nn<\u22121\n\nn>\u22122\n\n\f-61The operators VA (\u03b6|z), \u03b6 \u2208 V\u03b12 satisfy the commutation relations\n\u0013\n\u0012\nl(n)\nX\nn+1\n(212)\nV (Lk \u03b6|z),\n[Ln , VA (\u03b6|z)] =\nz n\u2212k\nk+1 A\nk=\u22121\n\nwhere l(n) = n if n > \u22122 and l(n) = \u221e otherwise. It is not difficult to show that chiral vertex\noperators are in fact uniquely characterized by the properties (209): Transformation property (212)\nand definition (211) of the operators VA (\u03be|z) are closely related to the conformal Ward identities in\nthe case of the three-punctured Riemann sphere. It follows that the matrix elements of VA (\u03be|z) can\n3 ,\u03b12 ,\u03b11\nbe expressed in terms of the trilinear form \u03c1\u03b1\nas follows (cf.

Generalized chiral vertex operators\nIt is often useful to further generalize the notion of chiral vertex operators [MS]: One considers\nthem as describing the \"fusion\" of two \"in-going\" representations V\u03b12 and V\u03b11 associated to points\nz2 and z1 on the Riemann sphere into a third representation V\u03b13 . A generalized vertex operator\n2 \u03b11\nV\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 , will then represent a map V\u03b12 \u2297 V\u03b11 \u2192 V\u03b13 which is defined by\nX\n\u03b13 ,\u03b12 ,\u03b11\nt\n2 \u03b11\nV\u03b13 ;\u03b1\n(215)\n(v\u03bd , \u03be2 , \u03be1 ).\n\u03c1\u221e,z\nv\u03bd,\u03b1\nz2 z1 (\u03be2 \u2297 \u03be1 ) =\n2 ,z1\n3\n\u03bd\u2208T\n\nThese objects are related to the operators VA (\u03be|z) as follows:\n(216)\n\n\u03b11\n\u03b13\n2 \u03b11\nV\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 (\u03be2 \u2297 \u03be1 ) = V\u03b12 \u03b11 (\u03be2 |z2 )V\u03b11 0 (\u03be1 |z1 ).\n\n2 \u03b11\nIntroducing the operators V\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 is useful to make a profound analogy between conformal field\ntheory and representation theory more manifest: Let us define an action of the Virasoro algebra on\nthe tensor product V\u03b12 \u2297 V\u03b11 by means of the co-product\n\u0013\nl(n) \u0012\nX\n\u0001\nn+1\n\u2206z2 ,z1 (Ln ) \u2261\n(217)\nz2n\u2212k Lk \u2297 id + z1n\u2212k id \u2297 Lk .\nk+1\n\nk=\u22121\n\n2 \u03b11\nV\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1\n\nThe definition of\nin terms of the conformal Ward identities (via \u03c1 in (215)) is then equivalent to the following intertwining property:\n(218)\n\n\u03b13 ;\u03b12 \u03b11\n2 \u03b11\nLn V\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 (\u2206z2 ,z1 (Ln ) * \u03be2 \u2297 \u03be1 ).\nz2 z1 (\u03be2 \u2297 \u03be1 ) = V\n\n2 \u03b11\nThe operators V\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 are analogous to the Clebsch-Gordon maps that describe the projection of\nthe tensor product of two representations onto a third one.

FUSION AND BRAIDING\nSo far we have considered chiral vertex operators and conformal blocks in the sense of formal\npower series only. It appears to be difficult to get information on the analytical properties of these\nobjects from the above definition in terms of representation theory of the Virasoro algebra. It will\ntherefore be important to have an alternative realization that allows one to prove convergence of\nthe power series defining the conformal blocks and to study their analytic properties (monodromies,\nbraiding...).\n18.1. Free field realization\nA useful realization of chiral vertex operators is furnished by the operators gs\u03b1 (x+ ) that were\nintroduced in Part III, Subsection 15.2: Let us recall that these were well-defined as operators for\nnegative euclidean time \u03c4 = it.

Fusion\nThe generalized braid relations (225) also allow one to construct a kind of associativity relation\nbetween s- and t-channel compositions of chiral vertex operators that is analogous to the MooreSeiberg \"fusion move\": It is a relation of the following form:\n\u0001\n\u03b1s ;\u03b12 \u03b11\n3 \u03b1s\nV\u03b14 ;\u03b1\nz3 z1 \u03be3 \u2297V\nz21 0 (\u03be2 \u2297 \u03be1 ) =\nZ\n\u0001\n(231)\n\u03b1t ;\u03b13 \u03b12\nt \u03b11\n3 \u03b12\n] V\u03b14 ;\u03b1\n=\nd\u03b1t F\u03b1s \u03b1t [ \u03b1\nz2 z1 V\nz32 0 (\u03be3 \u2297 \u03be2 ) \u2297 \u03be1 ) .\n\u03b14 \u03b11\nS\n\nSuch relations can be read as expressing some sort of associativity of the \"fusion products\" of representations defined by means of \u2206z2 ,z1 , with fusion coefficients F\u03b1s \u03b1t playing the role of the RacahWigner coefficients from angular momentum theory. The associativity relation (231) is essentially\nequivalent to relations for the corresponding conformal blocks like\nZ\n\u03b13 \u03b12\n\u03b13 \u03b12\n3 \u03b12\n(232)\n](z).\n] F\u03b1t t [ \u03b1\n](z)\n=\nd\u03b1t F\u03b1s \u03b1t [ \u03b1\nF\u03b1s s [ \u03b1\n\u03b14 \u03b11\n4 \u03b11\n4 \u03b11\nS\n\nRelations of the form (231) can indeed be constructed in terms of the braid relations (225) and\n(219). This is done by defining fusion as the result of the sequence of braid-moves that may be\nschematically indicated by 3(21) \u2192 3(12) \u2192 1(32) \u2192 (32)1, cf. [MS]. The first and the last of\nthese moves are represented by (219), the middle one by (225). By means of the explicit expressions\nfor O\u01eb and B\u03b1\u01eb s \u03b1u it is possible to verify that the resulting relation (231) does not depend on the sign\nchoices made to define the generalized chiral vertex operators involved in (231).\n\n\f-65Taking into account the explicit expression for G(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) that follows from (193), it is\nstraightforward to deduce the following explicit expression for F\u03b1s \u03b1t from (226):\n3\nF\u03b1s \u03b1t [ \u03b1\n\u03b14\n\n(233)\n\n\u03b12\n\u03b11\n\nN(\u03b14 , \u03b13 , \u03b1s )N(\u03b1s , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) \b \u03b12\nN(\u03b14 , \u03b1t , \u03b11 )N(\u03b1t , \u03b13 , \u03b12 ) \u1fb14\n\n] \u2261\n\n\u03b11\n\u1fb13\n\n\u03b1s\n\u1fb1t\n\nb\n\n,\n\nwith N(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) being defined by the expression\nN(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) =\n(234)\n\n=\n\n\u0393b (2\u03b11 )\u0393b (2\u03b12 )\u0393b (2Q \u2212 2\u03b13 )\n.\n\u0393b (2Q \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 )\u0393b (Q \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 + \u03b13 )\u0393b (\u03b11 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 )\u0393b (\u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )\n\nWe will discuss the relation between the b-Racah-Wigner coefficients that appear in (233) and the\nrepresentation theory of Uq (sl(2, R)) in Section 19.\n\n18.4. Consistency conditions\nDifferent ways to construct conformal blocks by composing generalized chiral vertex operators\ncan be associated with the tree-level Feynman graphs in a \u03c63 theory, where all lines are \"colored\"\nwith labels \u03b1 \u2208 S of Virasoro Verma modules. The corresponding graphs with colors only on\nthe external lines parameterize sets of conformal blocks which have elements distinguished by the\ncoloring of the internal lines. One may view the elementary braiding transformation (219) and the\nfusion relation (231) as elementary moves that allow one to relate sets of conformal blocks which\nhave graphs with the same number and coloring of the external lines. The relation between two such\ngraphs can generically be decomposed into elementary braid- and fusion transformations in more\nthan one way, but the resulting relation between the two sets of conformal blocks must be identical.\nThis leads to a bunch of identities that fusion and braid coefficients have to satisfy [MS][FFK].

RELATION TO TENSOR CATEGORY OF QUANTUM GROUP\nREPRESENTATIONS\nWe had expressed the fusion- and braid coefficients of Liouville theory in terms of some object\nthat we called \"b-Racah-Wigner coefficients\". These objects were first constructed as \"re-coupling\"\ncoefficients that describe the relation between two canonical ways to reduce the triple tensor products\nof certain quantum group representations into irreducible representations [PT2]. Their role within\nquantum group representation theory is therefore analogous to the role of the fusion coefficients\nfor the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra. We will see that fusion- and b-Racah-Wigner\ncoefficients become identical by a suitable choice of normalization of the chiral vertex operators.\nWe therefore observe a deep relationship between representation theory of the Virasoro algebra and\nquantum group representation theory, for which a more direct explanation remains to be found.\n19.1. A class of representations of Uq (sl(2, R))\nLet us recall the definition of the quantum group in question: Uq (sl2 ) is a Hopf-algebra with\ngenerators: E,\n\nF,\n\nK,\n\nK \u22121\n\nrelations: KE = qEK\n\nK 2 \u2212 K \u22122\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\u22121\n\u2206(E) =E \u2297 K + K \u2297 E\n\nKF = q \u22121 F K\n\n(236)\nco-product: \u2206(K) = K \u2297 K\n\n[E, F ] = \u2212\n\n\u2206(F ) =F \u2297 K + K \u22121 \u2297 F\n\u0001\nq-Casimir: C = F E \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )\u22122 qK 2 + q \u22121 K \u22122 \u2212 2\n\nWe will use the notation Uq (sl(2, R)) for Uq (sl2 ) supplemented by the following star-structure\n(237)\n\nstar-structure: K \u2217 = K\n\nE\u2217 = E\n\nF \u2217 = F,\n\nwhich defines the hermiticity assignments for what is called a unitary representation of Uq (sl(2, R)).\nThe following set of representations P\u03b1 by unbounded operators on the Hilbert-space L2 (R) was\nconsidered in [PT1][PT2]:\ne\u03c0ib(Q\u2212\u03b1) V \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0ib(Q\u2212\u03b1) V\u22121\ne\u03c0ib2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0ib2\ne\u2212\u03c0ib(Q\u2212\u03b1) V \u2212 e\u03c0ib(Q\u2212\u03b1) V\u22121\nF\u03b1 = U\u22121\ne\u03c0ib2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0ib2\n\nE\u03b1 = U+1\n(238)\n\nK\u03b1 = V,\n\nwhere U is the operator of multiplication by e2\u03c0bx , and V acts on f (x) as Vf (x) = f (x + i 2b ).\nThese representations appear in the list of \"well-behaved\" unitary irreducible representations of\nUq (sl(2, R)) that was obtained in [S1] when \u03b1 \u2208 Q\n2 + iR. However, these representations do not\nreproduce representations of the classical Lie algebra sl(2, R) in the limit b \u2192 0, which is why we\nwill call this series of representations the \"strange series\" of Uq (sl(2, R)).\n19.2. Why to consider the strange series?\nThe proposal [PT1] to consider the representations introduced in the previous subsection was\nmotivated by previous proposals concerning the appearance of objects from the representation theory\n\n\f-67of quantum groups in Liouville theory, going back to [FT, B1, G1] (see [CGR, GS1] for more\nrecent developments). It was shown in particular in [CGR, GS1] that chiral vertex operators which\ncorrespond to triples (\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) subject to a certain integrality constraint have fusion coefficients\nthat can be expressed in terms of q-6j symbols associated to the quantized universal enveloping\nalgebra Uq (sl2 ). It is then natural to expect that fusion and braiding transformations of general\nchiral vertex operators can also be expressed in terms of q-6j symbols associated to Uq (sl2 ).\nThe problem is to choose the right set of representations of Uq (sl2 ). Let us present an a-posteriori\nline of argument that leads to the proposal of [PT1]. This proposal was originally made for the\n\"weak-coupling\" case of real b. The first question is: What hermiticity relations should the generators of Uq (sl2 ) satisfy in the representation (choice of star-structure for Uq (sl2 ))? The results\nof [CGR, GS1] indicate that the deformation parameter q is related to the coupling constant b of\nLiouville theory via\n(239)\n\n2\n\nq = e\u03c0ib .\n\nIt is shown in [MMNNSU] that the only star-structure on Uq (sl2 ) that is compatible with (239) is\n(237). This motivates us to look for unitary representations of Uq (sl(2, R)). A classification result\nfor such representations can be found in [S1]. But which of these representations should we choose?\nThe representation introduced in (238) is distinguished by having a certain remarkable self-duality\nproperty under the replacement b \u2192 b\u22121 : These representations have the property that replacing\nb \u2192 b\u22121 in the expressions for the generators E\u03b1 , F\u03b1 , E\u03b1 above yields operators \u1ebc\u03b1 F\u0303\u03b1 , K\u0303\u03b1 that\ngenerate a representation of the \"dual\" algebra Uq\u0303 (sl(2, R)) that commutes with the Uq (sl(2, R))representation generated by E\u03b1 , F\u03b1 , K\u03b1 9 .\nR EMARK 9. - An alternative point of view on this self-duality phenomenon is to regard the strange\nseries representations as representations of the modular double of Uq (sl(2, R)) introduced by Faddeev[F], see [KLS, Section 1] for a nice discussion of this concept.\nIt is this self-duality that may be taken as a hint that this class of representations is well-suited for\nmaking contact with the DOZZ-proposal on the one hand (where we had observed such a self-duality\nearlier), and with the results of [CGR, GS1] on the other hand. In these latter references it was in\nparticular found that the fusion coefficients for the special class of chiral vertex operators considered\ntherein show a factorization into q-6j symbols for Uq (sl2 ) times q\u0303-6j symbols for Uq\u0303 (sl2 )) where\n2\nq\u0303 = e\u03c0i/b , expressing a form of b \u2192 b\u22121 duality for that particular class of operators.\n\n19.3. Generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficients\nWe will now briefly review the results of [PT2] which is devoted to the construction of the bRacah-Wigner coefficients of the strange series representations.\n9 The\n\nprecise sense of this term is subtle in this context involving unbounded operators. In fact, these two sets of operators\ndo not commute in the strict sense (commutativity of spectral projections). The statement rather is that there exists a natural\ndomain P\u03b1 such that the representations of Uq (sl(2, R)) and Uq\u0303 (sl(2, R)) that are generated by E\u03b1 , F\u03b1 , K\u03b1 and \u1ebc\u03b1\nF\u0303\u03b1 , K\u0303\u03b1 respectively commute on P\u03b1 . The domain P\u03b1 may be considered as an analogue of the Schwartz-space for the\nrepresentations of the two Hopf-algebras\n\n\f-68The first main result of [PT2] is the closure of the strange series representations under tensor\nproducts:\nP\u03b12 \u2297 P\u03b11\n\n(240)\n\nZ\u2295\n\u2243\nd\u03b1 P\u03b1,\n\nS\u2261\n\nQ\n+ iR+ .\n2\n\nS\n\nThis result forms the basis for an associated calculus of Clebsch-Gordan and Racah-Wigner coefficients that strongly resembles standard angular momentum theory:\nTo begin with, one needs to note that the projection operators C(\u03b13 |\u03b12 , \u03b11 ) : P\u03b12 \u2297 P\u03b11 \u2192 P\u03b13\nmay be explicitly represented by an integral transform\nZ\n3 \u03b12 \u03b11\ndx2 dx1 [ \u03b1\n(241)\n] f (x2 , x1 ).\nC(\u03b13 |\u03b12 , \u03b11 ) : f (x2 , x1 ) \u2212\u2192 F [f ](\u03b13 |x3 ) \u2261\nx3 x2 x1\nR\n\nExplicit expressions for the distributional kernel [. . . ] (the \"Clebsch-Gordan coefficients\") can be\nfound in [PT2].

Generalized Racah-Wigner coefficients\nTriple tensor products P\u03b13 \u2297 P\u03b12 \u2297 P\u03b11 carry a representation \u03c0321 of Uq (sl(2, R)) given by\n(id \u2297 \u2206) \u25e6 \u2206 = (\u2206 \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u2206. The projections affecting the decomposition of this representation\ninto irreducibles can be constructed by iterating Clebsch-Gordan maps.

Details will be given elsewhere.\nBy inserting (248) into (247) one has finally brought the fusion transformations of conformal\nblocks into a form that makes the analogy with the definition (245) of the b-Racah-Wigner symbols\nperfect.\n\n19.6. Locality and crossing symmetry\nThe relation between fusion coefficients and b-Racah-Wigner symbols is quite useful: Having\nestablished the existence of fusion transformations of the form (231) allows one to translate the\ncondition of crossing symmetry into a relation involving the three point functions C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 )\ntogether with the fusion coefficients:\nZ\n3 \u1fb12\n3 \u03b12\n]=\n]F\u1fb1s \u1fb1t [ \u1fb1\nd\u03b1s C(\u03b14 , \u03b13 , \u03b1s )C(\u1fb1s , \u03b12 , \u03b11 )F\u03b1s \u03b2t [ \u03b1\n\u1fb14 \u1fb11\n\u03b14 \u03b11\n(249)\nS\n= \u03b4S (\u03b1t , \u03b2t )C(\u03b14 , \u03b1t , \u03b11 )C(\u1fb1t , \u03b13 , \u03b12 ),\n\u0002\u03b1 \u03b1 \u0003\nQ\n\u2032\n3 2\nwhere \u03b4S (\u03b1t , \u03b2t ) = \u03b4(P \u2212 P \u2032 ) if \u03b1t = Q\n2 + iP , \u03b2t = 2 + iP . We have used that F\u03b1s \u03b1t \u03b14 \u03b11 =\n\u0002\u1fb13 \u1fb12 \u0003\nF\u1fb1s \u1fb1t \u1fb14 \u1fb11 , which trivially follows from the facts that the conformal blocks depend on the conformal dimensions only and \u2206\u03b1 = \u2206\u1fb1 .\n\n\f-70But on the other hand one may observe that the construction of the b-Racah-Wigner symbols in\nterms of representation theory of Uq (sl(2, R)) implies the following unitarity relation [PT2] :\nZ\n\b\u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1\n\b \u1fb1 \u1fb1 \u1fb1\n1\n2\ns\n1\n2\ns\nd\u03b1s Mb (\u03b1s ) \u03b1\n(250)\n= Mb (\u03b1t ) \u03b4S (\u03b1t , \u03b1\u2032t ),\n\u03b1t b \u1fb13 \u1fb14 \u1fb1\u2032 b\n3 \u03b14\nt\n\nS\n\nwhere \u1fb1i = Q \u2212 \u03b1i , \u03b1t , \u03b2t \u2208 S, and the measure Mb (\u03b1) is given by\n(251)\n\nMb (\u03b1) = |Sb (2\u03b1)|2 = \u22124 sin(\u03c0b(2\u03b1 \u2212 Q)) sin(\u03c0b\u22121 (2\u03b1 \u2212 Q)).\n\nIt now suffices to observe (250) ensures validity of (249) for all C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) of the form\n(252)\n\nC(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) = Nb\n\n3\nY\n\n\u03ba(\u03b1i )N\u22121 (\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 )N\u22121 (\u1fb13 , \u1fb12 , \u1fb11 ),\n\ni=1\n\nwith arbitrary function \u03ba(\u03b1) and constant Nb . The DOZZ-formula for C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) is easily found\nto be of the form (252) for suitable choice of \u03ba(\u03b1), Nb .\nThis establishes crossing symmetry for the four-point functions of operators V\u03b1 that are characterized by the DOZZ-formula for C(\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ). The proof of locality is almost identical.\nR EMARK 10. - Up to now we have mostly assumed that the relevant representations V\u03b1 all correspond to the unitary representations in the spectrum, \u03b1 \u2208 S \u2261 Q\n2 + iR. However, fusion-coefficients\nF and normalization coefficients N (\u03b13 , \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) all possess a meromorphic continuation to generic\ncomplex values of the representation labels. Due to the analytic properties of the conformal blocks\nw.r.t. the representation labels (cf. Part I, Subsection 7.1) one may study the analytic continuation\nof the fusion relations (231) in a way that is very similar to our discussion in Part I, Subsection 7.2.\n19.7. Remark on the strong coupling regime\nOur derivation of braiding and fusion transformations of the conformal blocks in Liouville theory\nwas based on the results of [PT2]. Strictly speaking, it is therefore not directly applicable to the\nregime of strong coupling (b = ei\u03c6 , \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c02 )). However, it seems to us that the arguments of\n[PT2] can be modified to become applicable to the strong coupling case as well. Moreover, if one\nconsiders the relations on the level of conformal blocks, cf. e.g. (232), one may note that all the\nappearing objects can be analytically continued w.r.t. the parameter b from the weak- to the strong\ncoupling regime. We consider it therefore as very likely that all of our discussion applies to the\nstrong coupling case with hardly any change.\nLet us note, however, that there exists an alternative proposal for fusion and braid relations of\nchiral vertex operators at special values of b [G2] (see also [GR1][GR2]). This proposal is based\non the construction of a solution to the consistency conditions (cf. Subsection 18.4) that fusion\nand braiding coefficients must satisfy, which involves only a discrete set of representation labels\ncorresponding to unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra.\nSo far it seems difficult to decide whether this alternative proposal is actually realized. On the\none hand it is not clear whether a given solution of the consistency conditions discussed in Subsection 18.4 must in fact be realized by the chiral vertex operators that are uniquely defined in\nterms of the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra. To the author's knowledge there does\nnot exist a calculation like the one given in Section 16 which would prove that the chiral vertex\n\n\f-71operators for irreducible representation of the Virasoro algebra satisfy the braid relations proposed\nin [G2][GR1][GR2].\nOn the other hand, it is also not obvious that the proposal of [G2] [GR1][GR2] contradicts our\nresults. So far we do not see any reason why there should not exist two different representations\nof fusion- and braid relations, at least for special values of b and under suitable restrictions on the\nrepresentation labels.\n\n20. UNITARY FUSION?\nAs an outlook, we would like to discuss a notion of \"fusion\" for unitary representations of the\nVirasoro algebra that should allow to make the deeper mathematical reasons for the consistency of\nLiouville theory more transparent.\nViewing the chiral vertex operators as Clebsch-Gordan maps for a modified tensor product (\"fusion product\") of Virasoro representations naturally leads to the question of compatibility of the\nfusion product with unitarity of the representation. More precisely: Is it possible to relate the above\nnotion of fusion product to a concept of fusion which manifestly creates a unitary \"fused\" representation as product of two given unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra? In more physical\nterms this is of course closely related to the natural question whether the set of vertex operators creating unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra is closed under operator product expansion. A\nconcept of fusion (\"Connes-fusion\") that fulfills such a task is known for the WZNW-models associated to the group SU (N ) [Wa]. We will try to outline how a similar treatment should look like in\nthe case of unitary Virasoro representations. But before let us indicate how Connes-fusion is related\nto the more standard picture of fusion that goes back to [BPZ]:\n\n20.1. Heuristics: Fusion on the unit circle\nLet us briefly recall (from e.g. [BPZ][MS]) the complex analytic picture of fusion and the asso2 \u03b11\nciated notion of chiral vertex operators: A chiral vertex operator V\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 is thought of as being\nassociated with a Riemann sphere with three marked points, one of which was chosen to coincide\nwith infinity. The representations V\u03b13 , V\u03b12 and V\u03b11 are assigned to the marked points at \u221e, z2\nP\nand z1 respectively. A Virasoro generator T [v] = n\u2208Z vn Ln that \"goes out to\" \u221e would then be\nR\nP\nrepresented by the contour integral C\u221e dzT (z)v(z), v(z) = n\u2208Z z n+1 vn , where C\u221e is a small\ncircle around the point \u221e. Its action on the \"ingoing\" representation V\u03b12 and V\u03b11 is obtained by\ndeforming the contour C\u221e into two small circles around the points z2 and z1 respectively. This\nprescription directly leads to the formula (217) for the co-product.\nThis prescription encodes the analyticity of T (z) within euclidean vacuum expectation values.\nIt is clear that the euclidean picture is not well-suited for questions of unitarity: The euclidean\ntime evolution is not unitary. One should therefore try to change (\"Wick-rotate\") to a Minkowskian\npicture. Let us observe that in the case of the cylinder the possibility of deforming the contour C\nR\nthat enters the definition of T [v] = C dzT (z)v(z) would correspond to conservation of the charge\nR 2\u03c0\nT [v] \u2261 0 d\u03c3v(\u03c3)T (\u03c3), \u2202t T [v] = 0 in a minkowskian framework.\n\n\f-72In order to change to a Minkowskian picture in the case of the sphere with three marked points,\none needs a global notion of time on that geometry. A convenient choice is given by the mapping\nr(z) = d ln(z \u2212 z2 ) + (1 \u2212 d) ln(z \u2212 z1 ).\n\n(253)\n\nThe global (euclidean) time-coordinate is given by t = R(r). Lines of constant t may on the Riemann sphere be visualized as electrostatic \"equipotential lines\" for the potential around the charges\nat points z2 and z1 . r(z) maps the complex plane to a diagram that is known as Mandelstam diagram\nin light-cone string theory:\nr\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nz1\n1\n\nz2\nt = t\u2217\n\nThe markings on the lines in the left part of the diagram are supposed to indicate identifications. The\nregions marked by 1 and 2 therefore represent (part of) \"ingoing\" semi-infinite cylinders, whereas\nthe region 3 represents an \"outgoing\" semi-infinite cylinder. These cylinders are joined at time\nt = t\u2217 , where t\u2217 is a function of z1 , z2 and d that can be figured out from the definition of r(z). The\ntime-slice at t = t\u2217 looks like the unit circle S 1 divided into two intervals I and I c , where S(I) (I\nwith end-points identified) represents the ending of the semi-infinite cylinder 2, S(I c ) the ending of\ncylinder 1.\nBy means of r(z) one therefore maps the previous contour-deformation picture for the definition\nof the co-product into a picture with obvious Minkowskian counterpart: On each of the cylinders\none may use charge conservation to shift T [v] to the left or right, so everything boils down to the\nR\nsplitting at t = t\u2217 . This splitting should clearly be purely geometrical: If T [f ] = S 1 d\u03c3f (\u03c3)T (\u03c3)\nis the generator of an infinitesimal transformation, it should split into T [f \u0398I ] and T [f \u0398I c ], where\n\u0398I denotes the characteristic function of the interval I.\nIt is not a trivial task to turn this heuristic idea into a rigorous definition of fusion that makes the\nissue of unitary more transparent: First, it is not clear which scalar product to put on V\u03b12 \u2297 V\u03b11\nsuch that the action defined by the geometric splitting of the unit circle into two subintervals is\nwell-defined and unitary. If one would just take the canonical scalar product on the tensor product of\nrepresentations, one would get the following problem: f \u0398I and f \u0398I c , when considered as functions\non the circles S(I) and S(I c ), will generically have jumps at the points corresponding to the endpoints of I. This leads to the problem that the vector T [f \u0398I ]v2 \u2297 T [f \u0398I c ]v1 will generically not be\nnormalizable when the standard norm in V\u03b12 \u2297 V\u03b11 is taken.\nIt seems to us that these problems are just what is overcome by the so-called \"Connes-fusion\",\nmore precisely its more explicit version that was developed in [Wa] in the case of loop groups. We\n\n\f-73would next like to give an idea of such a formulation for the case of unitary representations of the\nVirasoro algebra.\n20.2. Connes-fusion for unitary Virasoro-representations?\nFirst, it is technically better to consider the group of diffeomorphisms of the unit circle and its\n(projective) unitary representations instead of its Lie algebra (the Virasoro) algebra and their representations. It is known [GW] that for c > 1 the Virasoro algebra representation V\u03b1 indeed exponentiates to a projective unitary representation of Diff(S 1 ) if \u2206 > 0, i.e. for all unitarizable\nrepresentations of the Virasoro algebra.\nIt should be possible to \"restrict\" Diff(S 1 ) to an interval I and its complement I c in a suitable\nsense, e.g. by considering the subgroups Diff(I) and Diff(I c ) generated by elements of the algebra\nR\nR\nlike S 1 d\u03c3T (\u03c3)f (\u03c3) and S 1 d\u03c3T (\u03c3)g(\u03c3), where f , g have support only in I, I c respectively.\nCentral objects are then the intertwining operators V\u03b1 that \"create\" the representation V\u03b1 from\nthe vacuum. Here one would consider in particular maps V\u03b1 \u2208 HomDiff(I) (V0 , V\u03b1 ) that intertwine\nthe respective actions of Diff(I) according to\n(254)\n\n\u03c0\u03b1 (g)V\u03b1 = V\u03b1 \u03c00 (g),\n\ng \u2208 Diff(I),\n\nc\n\nas well as their counterparts for I . Such maps should be given by smeared chiral vertex operators:\nZ\n\u0001\n(255)\nV\u03b1 (\u03be|f ) \u2261\nd\u03c3 f (\u03c3) V \u03b1\u03b10 (\u03be|\u03c3).\nS1\n\nc\n\nwhere f (\u03c3) has support only in I . It is important that f vanishes in I in order for the ordinary\nintertwining property (212) to translate into (254).\nc\nLet O\u03b1I 2 , O\u03b1I 1 be the spaces of operators HomDiff(I) (V0 , V\u03b1 ) and HomDiff(I c ) (V0 , V\u03b1 ) respectively. One has a correspondence between elements V\u03b1 \u2208 HomDiff(I) (V0 , V\u03b1 ) and the state V\u03b1 v0\nthat they create when acting on the vacuum. In view of that correspondence one may define fusion\nc\nfor elements of O\u03b1I 2 , O\u03b1I 1 instead of V\u03b12 , V\u03b11 .\nc\nFirst define a scalar product on O\u03b1I 2 \u2297 O\u03b1I 1 via the four-point conformal block\n\u0001\nV\u03b12 (\u03b62 |g2 ) \u2297 V\u03b11 (\u03be2 |f2 ) , V\u03b12 (\u03b61 |g1 ) \u2297 V\u03b11 (\u03be1 |f1 ) OI \u22a0OI c \u2261\n\u03b12\n\u03b11\n(256)\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2261 v0 , V\u03b12 (\u03b62 |g2 )V\u03b12 (\u03b61 |g1 ) V\u03b11 (\u03be2 |f2 )V\u03b11 (\u03be1 |f1 ) v0 V0 ,\n\u2020\n\u2020\nwhere gi , fi , i = 1, 2 have support in I c , I respectively, and V\u03b1\n(\u03b6|f ) is the adjoint of V\u03b1\n(\u03b6|f ) that\nmay be expressed as\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2020\n(257)\nd\u03c3 f \u2217 (\u03c3) V 0\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03be \u2217 |\u03c3).\nV\u03b1\n(\u03be|f ) \u2261\nS1\n\nc\nThe fusion O\u03b1I 2 \u22a0O\u03b1I 1\n\nc\n\nis defined as the completion of O\u03b1I 2 \u2297O\u03b1I 1 w.r.t. the scalar product introduced\n\nin (256).\nc\nO\u03b1I 2 \u2297 O\u03b1I 1 carries a natural action of Diff(I)\u00d7 Diff(I c ). It is easy to see that this action is unitary\nw.r.t. the scalar product (256). The crucial question now is whether the action of Diff(I) \u00d7 Diff(I c )\nc\nuniquely extends to a unitary action of Diff(S 1 ) on O\u03b1I 2 \u22a0 O\u03b1I 1 . This would be the desired representation of Diff(S 1 ) obtained as fusion of representations V\u03b12 and V\u03b11 associated to the intervals I and\nI c respectively. The unique extension of the Diff(I) \u00d7 Diff(I c )-action looks intuitively plausible:\nAs Diff(I) and Diff(I c ) contain diffeomorphisms that are nonzero arbitrarily close to the end points\n\n\f-74of the respective intervals, it seems unlikely that there is much freedom in \"defining the action at the\ntouching points\".\nLet us note that the proof of the corresponding unique extension property for loop group representations given in [Wa] makes essential use of the braiding relations for chiral vertex operators.

These relations would imply that\n\n\u0001\n(\u03b61 |g1 )V\n\n\u03b12\n\u03b11 \u03b1\n\u03b11\n0\n\u03b11\n\n\u0001 \u2217 \u2217\n(\u03b62 |g2 )\n\n\u0001\n(\u03be1 |f1 ) v0\n\nV0\n\n.\n\n2\n\nV\u03b12 (\u03b61 |g1 ) \u2297 V\u03b11 (\u03be1 |f1 ) OI \u22a0OI c =\n\u03b12\n\u03b11\nZ\n\u0001\n=\nd\u03bc\u03b12 \u03b11 (\u03b1) V \u03b1 \u03b12\u03b11 (\u03b61 |g1 )V\n\n(259)\n\n\u03b11\n0\n\u03b11\n\nS\n\n\u0001\n(\u03be1 |f1 ) v0\n\n2\n,\nV\u03b1\n\nwhere d\u03bc\u03b12 \u03b11 (\u03b13 ) can be worked out from the explicit expression for the braiding coefficients given\nin (226) as\nd\u03bc\u03b12 ,\u03b11 (\u03b13 ) =\n(260)\n\u00d7\n\n\u0393b (2Q)\nd\u03b13 |Sb (2\u03b13 )|2 \u00d7\n\u0393b (Q)\n\n\u0393b (\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 Q)\u0393b (\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 )\u0393b (\u03b11 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 )\u0393b (\u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )\n\u0393b (2\u03b11 )\u0393b (2\u03b12 )\u0393b (2\u03b13 )\n\n2\n\n.\n\nRelation (259) can be read as an expression for the unitary equivalence\n\n(261)\n\nO\u03b1I 2\n\n\u22a0\n\nc\nO\u03b1I 1\n\n\u2243\n\nZ\u2295\n\nd\u03bc\u03b12 \u03b11 (\u03b1) V\u03b1 .\n\nS\n\nThe unique extension of the Diff(I) \u00d7 Diff(I c )-action to an action of Diff(S 1 ) should then follow as\nin [Wa] from similar statements concerning the respective actions on the irreducible representations\nV\u03b1 that appear in (261).\nHaving established the braid relations (258) motivates our hope that a treatment along such lines\nis within reach. We find it particularly satisfactory to observe that the change of normalization of\nthe chiral vertex operators that established the relation between fusion coefficients and b-RacahWigner symbols is precisely such that the fusion density d\u03bc\u03b12 \u03b11 (\u03b1) would become proportional to\n2 \u03b11\nthe canonical measure d\u03b1|Sb (2\u03b1)|2 if we had used the chiral vertex operators C\u03b13 ;\u03b1\nz2 z1 instead of\n\u03b13 ;\u03b12 \u03b11\nthe V z2 z1 . This means that the normalization of chiral vertex operators that makes the relation to\nquantum group representation theory manifest is simultaneously a natural one from the point of view\nof Connes-Wassermann fusion. We believe that these ideas should make up for a rather beautiful\nstory when being worked out.\n\n\f-75REFERENCES\n\n[ABKS] O. Aharony, M. Berkooz, D. Kutasov, N.
