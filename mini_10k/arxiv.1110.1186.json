The study of the chemical composition of Planetary Nebulae in external galaxies\nis of paramount importance for the fields of stellar evolution and chemical enrichment history\nof galaxies. In recent years a number of spectroscopic studies with 6-8m-class telescopes have\nbeen devoted to this subject improving our knowledge of, among other, the time-evolution of\nthe radial metallicity gradient in disk galaxies, the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies, and\nstellar evolution at low metallicity.\nKeywords. techniques: spectroscopic; ISM: abundances, evolution, HII regions, planetary nebulae; galaxies: irregular, spiral, Local Group, evolution, abundances\n\n1. Introduction\nThe determination of the chemical composition of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in external\ngalaxies is extremely important both from the point of view of the stellar evolution,\nallowing us to study the stellar nucleosynthesis in different conditions, and from that of\nthe formation and evolution of galaxies, giving us the unique possibility to determine\ndirectly the chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) in different epochs\nthat the present one, such as, for example, at the time of the formation of the PN\nprogenitors.\nThe two points of view described above are strictly related. In fact, to understand\nthe chemical evolution of the host galaxy, we need to constrain the ISM chemical history, which in turn can be done effectively by knowing the elemental abundances of\nevolutionary-invariant elements. It is thus necessary to understand where and in which\nconditions (e.g., mass range, metallicity) elements such as oxygen or neon could be\ndredged-up to the stellar surface and consequently modify the composition of the original\ninterstellar cloud, where the progenitor star did form.\nIn this review we present recent results obtained with large-aperture, multi-object spectroscopy of extragalactic PNe. section 1 analyzes the PN and HII region abundances, and\ntheir radial metallicity distribution, in the spiral galaxies M33 and M81. The two populations allow inspection of time-evolution of the radial metallicity gradient. In Section\n2 we present the properties of PNe in dwarf galaxies, and their impact on chemical\nevolutionary models.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL. Magrini, L. Stanghellini, D. R. Gon\u00e7alves\n\n2. The time-evolution of the radial metallicity gradient\nOne of the most discussed questions about the radial metallicity gradient in disk galaxies is its evolution with time, which to date cannot be constrained by the existing arrays\nof chemical evolutionary models. Classical chemical evolutionary models predict different\ntemporal behaviors depending on assumptions over the gas inflow and outflow rates, the\nstar and cloud formation efficiencies, and other set-up physical conditions. Models might\npredict a steepening of metallicity gradients with time (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997, 2001),\nor, conversely, a flattening of such gradients (e.g., Moll\u00e1 et al. 1997, 2005; Magrini et\nal. 2007b). The main differences between the two groups of models are the efficiency of\nthe enrichment processes in the inner and outer regions of the disk, and the nature of\nthe material (primordial or pre-enriched) falling from the halo onto the disk. In all the\nabove-cited models, however, the dynamical effects, and the possible migration of stellar\npopulations, have been neglected, thus they might oversimplify the actual problem under\nexam (see for example L\u00e9pine et al (2011) for a description of the effect of spiral arms\non gradients).\nTo better understand galaxy evolution we need observational constraints for the theoretical scenarios. The comparison between chemical abundances of PNe and HII regions\nseems to be a very promising way to set strong constraints to the models, since the elemental abundances of both populations can be derived using the same set of observations,\nthe similar data reduction and analysis techniques, and identical abundance determination methods, yet they define different evolutionary times of the galaxy. In this way it\nis possible to avoid most of the biases due to the stellar vs. nebular analyses, in particular allowing the direct comparison of the same element, oxygen, at two epochs, and\nthus avoiding the dangerous comparison between \u03b1- and iron-peak-elements, whose ratio\ndepends on the star formation history of the galaxy.\n2.1. The PN populations in M33 and M81\nWe have studied the PN and HII region populations in two nearby spiral galaxies, M33\nand M81. M33 (also called NGC 598) belongs to the Local Group, at the distance of\n850 kpc (Galleti et al. 2004, Sarajedini et al. 2006). The M33 metallicity gradient derived from \u03b1-element abundances has been the focus of several studies, involving both\nPNe and HII regions (e.g., Crockett et al. 2006, Magrini et al. 2004, 2007a, 2009, 2010,\nRosolowsky & Simon 2008, Rubin et al. 2008, Bresolin 2011). On the other hand, M81\n(also NGC 3031) is the largest member of the nearest interacting group of galaxies\nat a distance of 3.60 Mpc (Freedman et al. 2001). Until a recent spectroscopic study\n(Stanghellini et al. 2010), the \u03b1-element abundances of PNe and HII regions in M81 have\nremained elusive, with the exception of 17 H II regions studied by Garnett & Shields\n(1987), The advantage of studying M33 and M81 instead of the Galaxy as a playground\nfor gradients is that extragalactic PNe have well determined galactocentric distances\n(with relative errors within 5%), compared to the large indetermination of Galactic PN\ndistances (Stanghellini et al. 2009).\nThe first step of the gradient analysis is to confirm which elements can be used to trace\nthe past ISM composition. The best candidates are oxygen and neon, and we should find\nout whether these elements could be modified through low- and intermediate-mass stars\n(LIMS) evolution. A possible way to verify this is to study the relationship between\nneon and oxygen abundances. These elements derive both from primary nucleosynthesis,\nmostly in stars with M>10 M\u2299 . If the O/H and Ne/H abundances are really independent\nof the evolution of the PN progenitors through the AGB phase, we should observe a tight\ncorrelation between their abundances. In Figure 1 we plot O/H against Ne/H for the 55\n\n\fJD 11. Chemical abundances of Extragalactic PNe\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. The relationship between oxygen and neon abundances in M33. Type I PNe and\nnon-type I PNe are plotted as filled circles and empty circles respectively, according to the\ndefinition of Dopita & Meatheringham (1991). The continuous line is the weighted least square\nfit to the complete sample of PNe.\n\nM33 PNe where both abundances were available. The slope of the correlation is close to\nunity, 0.90\u00b10.11, pointing at a locked variation of these two elements, and confirming that\nthere is no evidence of enhancement of oxygen and neon in PNe at M33 metallicities. It\nis possible that nucleosynthesis could affect the alpha-element abundances at much lower\nmetallicities. But this effect would be null at M81 metallicities, higher than those of\nM33, thus for both galaxies analyzed here we could safely assume O vs. Ne evolutionary\nlockstep (Stanghellini et al. 2010).\nThe second step is to identify the PNe with the least massive progenitors, thus the\noldest ones, such as for example the non-Type I PNe. In this way one could detect the\nsignature of galactic chemical evolution in the comparison of old PN progenitors with\nthe young stellar population traced by the HII regions. If we examine the locus of M33\nand M81 disk PNe on the He/H-N/O plane we can single out the Type I PNe, and then\nselect the remaining PNe as the oldest population in either galaxy. It is worth recalling\nthat the Type I PNe are metallicity dependent (the amount of nitrogen produced by\nhot bottom burning is dependent on the amount of carbon, and the oxygen abundance\ndepends on the metallicity of the galaxy, see Magrini et al. 2009 and Stanghellini et al.\n2010 for details). No Type I PN has been detected in M81. Also, interestingly, no M81\n\n\f4\n\nL. Magrini, L. Stanghellini, D. R. Gon\u00e7alves\n\nFigure 2. Oxygen radial gradient of M33: HII regions averaged on bin of 1 kpc are shown\nwith filled circles (blue), non-Type I PNe with empty squares (green).\n\nPN shows the HeII 4686 emission line. On the other hand, about 20% of the observed\nPNe in M33 are of Type I, and we detected HeII 4686 in many PNe. We conclude that the\npopulations of the brightest PNe in galaxies strongly depend upon galactic metallicity.\nIn fact, at high metallicities, such as in M81, the brightest PNe are not those with\nthe hottest Central Stars (CSs). The post-AGB shells with very hot CSs are enshrouded\nin dust at early phases of their evolution, thus still thick to the H\u03b1 radiation. The\nthinning time depends on metallicity, being shorter at low metallicity, and too long at\nM81 metallicity to allow us to observe PNe with massive progenitors among the brightest\nones. For this reason in M81 we detect only PNe with low mass progenitors.\n2.2. The radial metallicity gradients\nOnce defined the sample of old PNe, we compared their radial gradient with that of HII\nregions. In M33 we found for non-Type PNe (72 objects)\n12 + log(O/H) = (8.41 \u00b1 0.06) \u2212 (0.030 \u00b1 0.013) \u00d7 RGC\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere RGC is the de-projected galactocentric distance. For HII regions, including the\nliterature data described in Magrini et al. (2010) and the new data of Bresolin (2011) for\nthe HII regions located in the central part of M33,\n12 + log(O/H) = (8.50 \u00b1 0.02) \u2212 (0.045 \u00b1 0.006) \u00d7 RGC .\n\n(2.2)\n\nBy taking into account the new data for HII regions by Bresolin 2011, there is a slight\ntrend to a metallicity gradient steepening with time. In addition we found that the global\nmetal content has evolved \u223c0.1 dex from the epoch of the formation of the PN progenitors\n\n\fJD 11. Chemical abundances of Extragalactic PNe\n\n5\n\nto the present-time. The result is more appreciable if we compare 12+log(O/H) averaged\non bins of 1 kpc as shown in Figure 2.\nIn M81 we can play with less objects, finding for PNe (19 objects)\n12 + log(O/H) = (8.72 \u00b1 0.18) \u2212 (0.055 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 RGC\n\n(2.3)\n\nand for HII regions (31 objects, from Garnett & Shields 1987 and from Stanghellini et\nal. 2010)\n12 + log(O/H) = (9.37 \u00b1 0.24) \u2212 (0.093 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 RGC .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe tendency seems again to favour a steepening with time, but the sample of HII\nregions for which a direct measurement of the electron temperature is available is very\nlimited both in number and galactocentric distance. The result for M81 need a further\ninvestigation extending the analysis to the very central regions and the extreme periphery\nof the galaxy.\nIt is very interesting to compare ther above findings with one of the most recent chemical evolutionary models (Rahimi et al. 2011). These Authors derived the evolution of the\nradial abundance gradients of the disk stars of a galaxy simulated with a three dimensional, fully cosmological chemical and dynamical galaxy evolution code. The comparison\nof their gradient for young disk stars. i.e. formed during the final 2 Gyr of the galaxy\nlife-time, with intermediate disk stars with ages 2 Gyr<Age<6 Gyr is very similar to the\nobservational findings described above for HII regions and non-Type I PNe: a translation\ntoward higher metallicity, indication a global enrichment, and a slight tendency to have\ngradient for the youngest population stepper than that of the oldest one.\n\n3. The chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies\nPNe belonging to dwarf galaxies are extremely interesting both because they allow\nus to investigate stellar evolution at low metallicity, and they give information about\nchemical evolution of dwarf galaxies. During the past five years the knowledge about\nPNe in dwarf galaxies has improved, and now the physical and chemical parameters of\nPNe in many nearby dwarf galaxies have been derived. A recent reference list includes\nthe dwarf Irregular (dIrrs) galaxies Sextans A and B (Magrini et al. 2005, Kniazev et\nal. 2005), IC 10 (Kniazev et al. 2008, Magrini & Gon\u00e7alves 2009, Yin et al. 2010), and\nNGC3109 and NGC6822 (Pena et al. 2007, Hern\u00e1ndez-Martnez et al. 2009); and the dwarf\nspheroidal companions of M31, NGC 185, NGC205, M32, and NGC147 (Gon\u00e7alves et\nal. 2007, Richer & McCall 2008, Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2011) and of our Galaxy, Fornax and\nSagittarius (Kniazev et al. 2007, Kniazev et al. 2008). In the following we describe some\nof the the most relevant results among the above papers.\n3.1. Third dredge-up and positive oxygen yields at low metallicity\nOne important aspect of stellar evolution is whether or not the efficiency of the third\ndredge-up (TDU, i.e., the process which brings the elements characterising the PN composition to the stellar surface during the AGB phase) depends on metallicity. Some stellar\nevolutionary models claim that such a dependence is strong, and that when the metallicity is very low, even the elements previously not known to be dredged-up, such as neon\nand oxygen, are indeed carried to the stellar surface (e.g. Suda & Fujimoto 2010, Karakas\n2010)\nHowever, the observational evidence of this low-metallicity phenomenon is still scarce.\nObservations of increasingly larger samples of Local Group PNe helped to analyze the\noccurrence of the TDU. In Figure 3 we show Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O versus O/H of several\n\n\f6\n\nL. Magrini, L. Stanghellini, D. R. Gon\u00e7alves\n\nFigure 3. Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O vs. O/H.

The nearly-horizontal lines\nshow the abundance line-ratios given by the a sampleof HII regions in blue compact galaxies,\nas compiled by Izotov et al. (2006). The vertical lines show the average 12+log(O/H) locus of\nthe samples of HII regions in each of the dIrr galaxies of this plot: lines are labelled with the\ncorresponding galaxy identification at the top of the plot.\n\nPN populations in dIrrs, plotted with the average oxygen abundance of the host galaxy\nHII regions (the vertical lines, see figure label).\nThe occurrence of the TDU in PNe is identified by: i) higher O/H with respect to the\ncorresponding ratio of HII regions; and ii) different Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O ratios with\nrespect to the HII regions. Neon, sulphur, and argon are dredged-up less efficiently than\noxygen, in most cases. We note PNe and HII regions have similar O/H ratios at high\nmetallicity, while at low metallicity, in particular when 12+log(O/H)< 7.7-7.8, many\nPNe are richer in oxygen than the present-time ISM (in Fig.3, these are found at the\nright of the average HII regions metallicity). This does not occur for all the metal poor\nPNe, probably because the TDU is related not only to the metal content, but also to the\nstellar mass and to other parameters such as rotation or magnetic fields.\nA similar analysis can not be done in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, due to the absence\nof a HII region population. Useful diagrams that identify the presence of the TDU in\nPNe belonging to dwarf spheroidals have been developed by Richer & McCall (2008).\n\n\fJD 11. Chemical abundances of Extragalactic PNe\n\n7\n\nFor example, the diagrams showing Ne/H vs O/H, or N/Ne vs Ne/O, can give useful\nhints of the TDU occurrence. Richer & McCall found a group of PNe having low Ne/O\nand high nitrogen (which is usually a signature of massive progenitors), indicating that,\noccasionally, oxygen is produced during the evolution of the stellar progenitors even in\ngalaxies where star formation is not present.\n3.2. The chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies\nThe large amount of information available for nearby dwarf galaxies, such as their gas\nand star content, their metallicity distribution, and their star formation history, allows\nus to use them to test chemical evolution models. As an example, for IC10 Magrini &\nGon\u00e7alves (2009) obtained the composition of a sample of HII regions and PNe. They\nfound a very limited enrichment in the metal content of IC10 in the time elapsed between\nthe birth of PN progenitors and the present-time. Yin et al (2010) compared these results\nwith a series of chemical evolutionary models in which they varied the star formation\nhistory (from continuous to burst) and included different treatments and assumptions for\ngalactic winds, namely respectively a model with no winds at all, one with standard wind\ntreatment, where the wind has the same chemical composition of the ISM, and finally a\nmodel with metal-enhanced winds.\nBoth models without wind and those with standard wind (i.e., stripping both H and\nmetals from the galaxy) disagree with the observational data, contrary to the model with\na metal-enhanced wind, which resulted to be in better agreement with the observations.\nThe best model to fit current data sets consists of a continuous wind that develops from\nthe first burst of star formation in the galaxy, and that strips the galaxy mostly its heavy\nelements.\nReferences\nBresolin, F. 2011, ApJ, 730, 129\nChiappini, C., Matteucci, F., & Gratton, R. 1997, ApJ, 477, 765\nChiappini, C., Matteucci, F., & Romano, D. 2001, ApJ, 554, 1044\nCrockett, N.
