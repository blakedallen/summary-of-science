The classification of reflexive polytopes in the\nframework of toric geometry is surely his most acknowledged contribution.\nHowever, his interests were much broader and together with M. Herbst and\nA. Kling he also wrote a couple of, I think, very nice papers on noncommutative geometry[1, 2]. In particular, they were analyzing open strings in the\nbackground of a non-constant two-form background, i.e. one with non-trivial\nthree-form flux, and found that in this case the coordinates are not only noncommutative but also nonassociative. Mathematically, an important role in\ntheir analysis was played by the Rogers dilogarithm. Intrigued by their results and similar ones by Cornalba/Schiappa [3], my collaborators and myself\nwondered whether a non-trivial three-form flux background might also have\nsimilar effects on the closed string sector, which is the one governing gravity.\nLet me pose three questions, which I believe have at least the potential\nto point to such new structures in closed string theory. It is expected that\nthe answers to these three questions are related, and some first concrete\ncomputations make it conceivable that string theory at small scales is dual\nto a theory which involves nonassociative spaces, for which the Kalb-Ramond\nfield has been traded for a nonassociatve deformation of ordinary Riemannian\ngeometry.\nClosed string generalization of noncommutative geometry\nIt is a well established fact that the effective theory on a D-brane equipped\nwith a non-trivial two-form magnetic flux F = B + F becomes noncommutative. This can be deduced by studying the conformal field theory on a flat\nD-brane with a constant magnetic field. In this case, the two-point function\nof two open string coordinates X a (z) inserted on the boundary of a disk takes\nthe form\nX a (\u03c41 ) X b (\u03c42 ) = \u2212\u03b1\u2032 Gab log(\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42 )2 + i \u03b8ab \u01eb(\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c4 stands for the real part of the complex world-sheet coordinate z.\nThe matrix Gab is symmetric and can be interpreted as the (inverse of the)\neffective metric seen by the open string. \u03b8ab is related to the two-form flux\nF ab\nas \u03b8ab \u2243 1+F\n2 and thus is anti-symmetric. The reason for the appearance\nof noncommutativity is the second term in (1) which means that the flux\n2\n\n\fdistinguishes between the order of the two-points on the boundary of the\ndisk.\nThis has been made more precise by analyzing open string scattering\namplitudes for open string vertex operators\nV = F (\u2202X \u03bc )eipX ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere F is a function of \u2202X. Since the second term in (1) is locally constant,\nit only contributes to correlation functions involving the exp(ipX) factor in\nthe vertex operators. Its effect is that it introduces non-trivial momentum\ndependent phases, which can be described by the introduction of a noncommutative product on the space of functions\n\u0001\n.\n(3)\nf1 (x) \u22c6 f2 (x) = exp i\u03b8ab \u2202ax1 \u2202bx2 f1 (x1 ) f2 (x2 )\nx1 =x2 =x\n\nThis is the Moyal-Weyl product, which implies [xa , xb ] = xa \u22c6xb \u2212xb \u22c6xb = i\u03b8ab .\nThus, noncommutavity arises for open strings in a magnetic flux background leading to noncommutative gauge theories. One might have expected\nthat noncommutative geometry should also play an important role for quantum gravity, but for closed strings a similar structure has not been identified.\nThinking about this question, one realizes that the closed string analogue\nmust clearly be different as here two vertex operators are inserted in the bulk\nof a two-sphere S 2 and no unambiguous ordering can be defined. Therefore,\none does not expect the same kind of noncommutativity to arise. Moreover,\nfor a closed string a constant B-field can be gauged away.\nHowever, if one considers three nearby points on the world-sheet S 2 of a\nclosed string, one can very well decide whether the loop connecting the three\npoints has positive or negative orientation. Thus, if there exists a background\nfield which distinguishes these two orientations, one would expect a nonvanishing result not for the simple commutator, but for the cyclic double\ncommutator\n\u0002 \u03bc \u03bd \u03c1\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nX , X , X := lim [X \u03bc (\u03c31 , \u03c4 ), X \u03bd (\u03c32 , \u03c4 )], X \u03c1 (\u03c33 , \u03c4 ) + cyclic .\n(4)\n\u03c3i \u2192\u03c3\nNow, the question is whether there exists a three-form with this property?\nNonlinear sigma models\nThe usual approach to string theory is perturbative, i.e. one considers a\nstring moving in a background with metric G\u03bc\u03bd , Kalb-Ramond field B\u03bc\u03bd and\n3\n\n\fdilaton \u03a6, whose dynamics is governed by a two-dimensional non-linear sigma\nmodel. With \u03a3 denoting the world-sheet of the closed string, its action reads\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nS=\nd2 z Gab + Bab \u2202X a \u2202X b + . . . ,\n(5)\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1 \u03a3\n\nwhere we suppressed the\n\u221a dilaton part. This is treated perturbatively in a\ndimensionless coupling \u03b1\u2032 /R, where R is a characteristic length scale of\nthe background. The guiding principle is conformal invariance. This means\nthat the string equations of motion for the space-time fields G\u03bc\u03bd , B\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a6\nare given by the vanishing beta-function equations. At leading order these\nequations read\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n2\nG\n0 = \u03b2ab\n= \u03b1\u2032 Rab \u2212 Ha cd Hbcd + 2\u2207a \u2207b \u03a6 + O(\u03b1\u2032 )\n4\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\n2\nB\n0 = \u03b2ab\n= \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u2207c H c ab + \u03b1\u2032 Hab c \u2207c \u03a6 + O(\u03b1\u2032 )\n(6)\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\u03a6\n0 = \u03b2ab\n= (d \u2212 dcrit ) + \u03b1\u2032 (\u2207\u03a6)2 \u2212 \u22072 \u03a6 \u2212 H 2 +O(\u03b1\u2032 ) .\n4\n2\n24\n\nThe first equation, for instance, is nothing else than Einstein's equation with\nsources. Clearly, in this approach one is assuming from the very beginning\nthat the string is moving through a Riemannian geometry with additional\nsmooth fields. However, it is well known that there exist conformal field\ntheories which cannot be identified with such simple geometries. These are\nleft-right asymmetric like for instance asymmetric orbifolds. The latter are\nasymmetric at some orbifold fixed points but one can imagine asymmetric\nCFTs which are not even locally geometric. What is the target space interpretation of such asymmetric CFTs?\nIn the non-linear sigma model one performs perturbation theory around\nthe large volume limit with diluted fluxes. Can one also define a perturbation\ntheory around the other limit, namely very small substringy sizes of the\nbackground? In view of double field theory, we have here in mind an effective\nfield theory describing the dynamics of winding states in a G\u03bc\u03bd , B\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6\nbackground.\nWhat is R-flux?\nIn the past, applying T-duality to known configurations has led to new insights into string theory, where a prominent example is the discovery of\n4\n\n\fD-branes. Applying T-duality to the closed string background[6] given by a\nflat space with constant non-vanishing three-form flux H = dB, results in a\nbackground with geometric flux. This so-called twisted torus is still a conventional string background, but a second T-duality leads to a non-geometric\nflux background. These are spaces in which the transition functions between two charts of a manifold are allowed to be T-duality transformations,\nhence they are also called T-folds. After formally applying a third T-duality,\nnot along an isometry direction anymore, one obtains an R-flux background\nwhich does not admit a clear target-space interpretation. It was proposed\nnot to correspond to an ordinary geometry even locally, but instead to give\nrise to a nonassociative geometry[7]. In addition to involving a T-duality in\na non-isotropic direction, another problem with this argument is that flat\nspace with constant H-flux is not an exact solution to the string equations of\nmotion. Therefore one should ask, whether nevertheless one can make this\nR-flux case more precise.\n\n2\n\nCFT analysis of H-flux\n\nThe remainder of this article is essentially a brief version of the more exhaustive analysis presented recently [8]. First, we note that the origin of T-duality\nlies in conformal field theory where it is nothing else than an asymmetric reflection (XL , XR ) \u2192 (XL , \u2212XR ). Therefore, it is tempting to try to analyze\nR-flux from the CFT point of view. In order to see what is going on, let\nus first perform a perturbative analysis of the H-flux case and then apply\na T-duality. We observe that a Ricci flat metric, vanishing dilaton and a\nconstant H-flux solves the string equation of motion up to linear order in H\nand arbitrary order in \u03b1\u2032 . Therefore, the starting point is a flat metric and\na constant H-flux specified by\n2\n\nds =\n\nN\nX\na=1\n\n\u00012\ndX a ,\n\nH=\n\n2\n\u03b8abc dX a \u2227 dX b \u2227 dX c ,\n\u03b1\u2032 2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere for simplicity we focus on N = 3. The expectation is that this background corresponds to a CFT up to linear order in H.\nTo proceed, we write the action (5) as the sum of a free part S0 and a\nperturbation S1 . Choosing a gauge such that Bab = 31 Habc X c , we have\nZ\n1 Habc\nd2 z X a \u2202X b \u2202X c .\n(8)\nS = S0 + S1\nwith\nS1 =\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 3 \u03a3\n5\n\n\fWe expect S1 to be a marginal operator (only) up to linear order in H.\nNow, one can apply conformal perturbation theory to compute the cora\na\nrection to the three-point functions of three currents J a = i\u2202X a , J = i\u2202X .\nc\nIt turns out that there are also non-vanishing correlators like hJ a J b J i, i.e.\nthe currents are not holomorphic respectively anti-holomorphic. However,\none can define new fields J a and J a\nJ a (z, z) = J a (z) \u2212 12 H a bc J b (z) XRc (z) ,\na\n\nJ (z, z) = J a (z) \u2212 21 H a bc XLb (z) J c (z)\n\n(9)\n\nso that the three current correlators take the CFT form\n1\n\u03b1\u2032 2 abc\nH\n,\n8\nz12 z23 z13\n\u03b1\u2032 2 abc\n1\na\nb\nc\nJ (z1 , z 1 ) J (z2 , z 2 ) J (z3 , z 3 ) = +i\nH\n.\n8\nz 12 z 23 z 13\n\nJ a (z1 , z 1 ) J b (z2 , z 2 ) J c (z3 , z 3 ) = \u2212i\n\n(10)\n\nThe necessity of this redefinition can already be understood from the twodimensional equation of motion \u2202\u2202X a = 12 H a bc \u2202X b \u2202X c . Therefore, already\nat linear order the coordinate fields have to be adjusted to be consistent with\na CFT description. However, the deformation is still marginal and nothing\nstarts to run.\nWriting the new currents as derivatives of corrected coordinates X a , after three integrations the three-point function of these coordinates can be\ncomputed as\n\u0010 \u0011i\nh \u0010 \u0011\nH\na\nb\nc\nabc\nz12\n(11)\nX (z1 , z 1 ) X (z2 , z 2 ) X (z3 , z 3 ) = \u03b8\nL z13 \u2212 L zz12\n13\nwith \u03b8abc =\n\n\u03b1\u2032 2\n12\n\nH abc and\n\n\u0010 1 \u0011\n\u0010\n1\u0011\n+L\n,\nL(z) = L(z) + L 1 \u2212\nx\n1\u2212x\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the Rogers dilogarithm is defined as\nL(z) = Li2 (z) +\n\n1\nlog(z) log(1 \u2212 z) .\n2\n\n(13)\n\nIt satisfies the so-called fundamental identity L(z) + L(1 \u2212 z) = L(1). The\nthree-point function (11) should be considered as the closed string generalization of the second term in (1). However, there two essential differences:\n6\n\n\f\u2022 For the closed string it is the three- and not the two-point function\nwhich is corrected.\n\u2022 For the closed string the Rogers dilogarithm gives rise to a non-trivial\nworld-sheet dependence, whereas for the open string only the essentially\nconstant step-function appeared.\nOne can also compute the correction to the two-point function of two coordinates. It reads\n\u03b1\u2032 2 a\n\u03b42 X (z1 , z 1 ) X (z2 , z 2 ) =\nH pq H bpq log |z1 \u2212 z2 |2 log \u01eb ,\n8\na\n\nb\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a cut-off. Therefore, we explicitly see that the perturbation S1\nceases to be marginal at second order in the flux. The theory is no longer\nconformally invariant and starts to run according to the renormalization\ngroup flow equation for the inverse world-sheet metric Gab , which is of the\nform\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u2202Gab\n= \u2212 H a pq H bpq .\n(15)\n\u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n4\nThis precisely agrees with equation (6) for constant space-time metric, H-flux\nand dilaton.\nUp to linear order in the flux we can write the energy-momentum tensor\nas\nT (z) =\n\n1\n\u03b4ab : J a J b : (z) ,\n\u03b1\u2032\n\nT (z) =\n\n1\n\u03b4ab : J a J b : (z) .\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(16)\n\nThey give rise to two copies of the Virasoro algebra with central charge c = 3\nand J a (J a ) is indeed a (anti-)chiral primary field with h = 1(h = 1).\nThe aim is to carry out a similar computation as for the open string case,\ni.e. to evaluate string scattering amplitudes for vertex operators and to see\nwhether there is any sign of a new space-time noncommutative/nonassociative\nproduct. Recall that in the free theory the tachyon vertex operator is a pri\u2032\n\u2032\nmary field of conformal dimension (h, h) = ( \u03b14 p2 , \u03b14 p2 ), and in covariant\nquantization of the bosonic string physical states are given by primary fields\nof conformal dimension (h, h) = (1, 1). The natural definition of the tachyon\nvertex operator for the perturbed theory is\n\u0001\nV(z, z) = : exp ip * (XL + XR ) : .\n(17)\n7\n\n\fOne can compute\nT (z1 ) V(z2 , z 2 ) =\n\n\u03b1\u2032 p * p\n1\nV(z2 , z 2 )+\n(z1 \u2212 z2 )2 4\n1\n\u2202V(z2 , z 2 ) + reg. ,\nz1 \u2212 z2\n\n(18)\n\nand analogously for the anti-holomorphic part. This means that the vertex\n\u2032\n\u2032\noperator (17) is primary and has conformal dimension (h, h) = ( \u03b14 p2 , \u03b14 p2 ) =\n(1, 1). It is therefore a physical quantum state of the deformed theory.\n\n3\n\nT-duality, R-flux and tachyon amplitudes\n\nEven though in the framework of the Buscher rules, applying three T-dualities\non the H-flux background is questionable, on the level of the CFT, T-duality\ncorresponds to a simple asymmetric transformation of the world-sheet theory. It is just a reflection of the right-moving coordinates. Since our corrected\nfields X a (z, z) still admit a split into a holomorphic and an anti-holomorphic\npiece, we define T-duality on the world-sheet action along the direction X a\nas\nXLa (z)\n+XLa (z) ,\nT-duality\n(19)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\nXRa (z)\n\u2212XRa (z) .\n\nUnder a T-duality in all three directions, momentum modes in the H-flux\nbackground are mapped to winding modes in the R-flux background. We\nare now interested in momentum modes in the R-flux background which are\nrelated via T-duality to winding modes in the H-flux background. Therefore,\nthe three-point function in the R-flux background should read\n\u0010 \u0011i\nh \u0010 \u0011\nR\nz 12\n+\nL\n,\n(20)\nX a (z1 , z 1 ) X b (z2 , z 2 ) X c (z3 , z 3 ) = \u03b8abc L zz12\nz 13\n13\nwhich just has a different relative sign between the holomorphic and anti\u20322\nholomorphic part. Here, we have the relation \u03b8abc = \u03b112 Rabc .\nFor the correlator of three tachyon vertex operators one obtains\nV1 V2 V3\n\nH/R\n\n=\n\n\u03b4(p1 + p2 + p3 )\n\u00d7\n|z12 z13 z23 |2\nh\n\u0002\nexp \u2212i\u03b8abc p1,a p2,b p3,c L\n8\n\nz12\nz13\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2213L\n\nz 12\nz 13\n\n\u0001\u0003i\n\n\u03b8\n\n(21)\n,\n\n\fwhere [. . .]\u03b8 indicates that the result is valid only up to linear order in \u03b8. The\nfull string scattering amplitude of the integrated tachyon vertex operators\nthen becomes\nZ Y\n3\nH/R\nT1 T2 T3\n=\nd2 zi \u03b4 (2) (zi \u2212 zi0 ) \u03b4(p1 + p2 + p3 )\u00d7\n(22)\ni=1\nh\ni\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\n12\nexp \u2212i\u03b8abc p1,a p2,b p3,c L zz13\n\u2213 L zz 12\n.\n13\n\u03b8\n\nLet us now study the behavior of (21) under permutations of the vertex\noperators. Before applying momentum conservation, the three-tachyon amplitude for a permutation \u03c3 of the vertex operators can be computed using\nthe relation L(z) + L(1 \u2212 z) = L(1). With \u01eb = \u22121 for the H-flux and \u01eb = +1\nfor the R-flux, one finds\nV\u03c3(1) V\u03c3(2) V\u03c3(3)\n\nH/R\n\nh\n\nexp i\n\n=\n1+\u01eb\n2\n\n\u0001\n\ni\n\u03b7\u03c3 \u03c0 2 \u03b8abc p1,a p2,b p3,c V1 V2 V3\n\nH/R\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere in addition \u03b7\u03c3 = 1 for an odd permutation and \u03b7\u03c3 = 0 for an even one.\nOne observes that for H-flux the phase is always trivial while for R-flux a\nnon-trivial phase may appear. Recall that our analysis is only reliable up to\nlinear order in \u03b8abc .\nNote that it is non-trivial that this phase is independent of the worldsheet coordinates, which can be traced back to the form of the fundamental\nidentity of L(z). For this reason, it can be thought of as a property of the\nunderlying target space. Indeed, the phase in (23) can be recovered from a\nnew three-product on the space of functions Vpn (x) = exp(i pn * x) which is\ndefined as\ndef\n\nVp1 (x) \u25b3 Vp2 (x) \u25b3 Vp3 (x) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c0 2 abc\nexp \u2212i 2 \u03b8 p1,a p2,b p3,c Vp1 +p2 +p3 (x) .\n\n(24)\n\nHowever, in CFT correlation functions operators are understood to be radially ordered and so changing the order of operators should not change the\nform of the amplitude. This is known as crossing symmetry. In the case of the\nR-flux background, this is reconciled by applying momentum conservation\nleading to\np1,a p2,b p3,c \u03b8abc = 0\n\nfor\n9\n\np3 = \u2212p1 \u2212 p2 .\n\n(25)\n\n\fTherefore, scattering amplitudes of three tachyons do not receive any corrections at linear order in \u03b8 both for the H- and R-flux.\nThe three-product (24) can be generalized to more generic functions as\ndef\n\nf1 (x) \u25b3 f2 (x) \u25b3 f3 (x) =\n\u0010 2\n\u0011\nexp \u03c02 \u03b8abc \u2202ax1 \u2202bx2 \u2202cx3 f1 (x1 ) f2 (x2 ) f3 (x3 )\n\nx\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere we used the notation ( )|x = ( )|x1 =x2 =x3 =x . This is to be compared\nwith the \u22c6-product (3) and can be thought of as a possible closed string\ngeneralization of the open string noncommutative structure. Note that (26)\nis precisely the three-product anticipated in an analysis of the SU(2) WZW\nmodel[9]. Indeed, the three-bracket for the coordinates xa can then be rederived as the completely antisymmetrized sum of three-products\n\u0002 a b c\u0003 X\nsign(\u03c3) x\u03c3(a) \u25b3 x\u03c3(b) \u25b3 x\u03c3(c) = 3\u03c0 2 \u03b8abc ,\n(27)\nx ,x ,x =\n\u03c3\u2208P 3\n\nwhere P 3 denotes the permutation group of three elements. For the WZW\nmodel[9], this three-bracket was defined as the Jacobi-identity (4) of the\ncoordinates, which can only be non-zero if the space is noncommutative and\nnonassociative (see also the similar paper by L\u00fcst[10]).\nThis result generalizes to the N-tachyon amplitude, where the relative\nphase can be described by the following deformed product\ndef\n\nf1 (x) \u25b3N f2 (x) \u25b3N . . .\u25b3N fN (x) =\n\"\n#\nX\n2\nx\nexp \u03c02 \u03b8abc\n\u2202axi \u2202b j \u2202cxk f1 (x1 ) f2 (x2 ) . . . fN (xN )\n1\u2264i<j<k\u2264N\n\nx\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nwhich is the closed string generalization of the open string noncommutative\nproduct (3). The phase becomes trivial after taking momentum conservation\ninto account or equivalently\nZ\nZ\nn\nd xf1 (x) \u25b3N f2 (x) \u25b3N . . .\u25b3N fN (x) = dn xf1 (x) f2 (x) . . . fN (x) . (29)\n\n4\n\nComments\n\nWe have used conformal perturbation theory to analyze the bosonic string\nmoving in an H- respectively R-flux background, at least up to linear order\n10\n\n\fin the flux. In the R-flux case, the application of T-duality to the string scattering amplitudes of tachyon vertex operators revealed a non-trivial threeproduct structure which was visible, however, only prior to implementing\nmomentum conversation. At first sight this might be puzzling, but it actually makes sense. If we had found a non-vanishing phase factor for a\nclosed string scattering amplitude, it would have been in clear conflict with\ncrossing symmetry of CFT amplitudes. Another way of saying this is: The\ndeformation of space-time as implied by a non-vanishing three-bracket for the\ncoordinates is consistent with the structure of two-dimensional CFT. In view\nof the fact that asymmetric CFTs are known to not admit a usual geometric\ntarget-space interpretation, this is an interesting observation.\nIn the original paper [8], we also computed the complete four-tachyon\nscattering amplitude. It could be written in the SL(2, C) invariant and explicitly crossing symmetric form\nhT1 T2 T3 T4 iH/R =\n(30)\nh\ni\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ\nexp \u2212i\u03b8abc p1a p2b p3c (\u2212 32 L(1) + L(X)) \u2213 (\u2212 23 L(1) + L(X))\n2\n\u03b8\ndX\n,\n|X|2\u22122a |1 \u2212 X|2\u22122c\nwhere X denotes the cross-ratio X =\n\u03b1\u2032\na = (p1 + p4 )2 \u2212 1 ,\n4\n\n(z1 \u2212z2 )(z3 \u2212z4 )\n(z1 \u2212z3 )(z2 \u2212z4 )\n\nand\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u03b1\u2032\n2\nb = (p1 + p3 ) \u2212 1 , c = (p1 + p2 )2 \u2212 1 . (31)\n4\n4\n\nThe three corresponding Mandelstam variables read u = \u2212(p1 + p4 )2 , t =\n\u2212(p1 + p3 )2 and s = \u2212(p1 + p2 )2 , and the on-shell external tachyons satisfy\n\u03b1\u2032 p2i = 4 so that a + b + c = 1. Equation (30) is the fluxed version of the\nVirasoro-Shapiro amplitude. The analysis of the pole-structure revealed that\nthe spectrum of states changes at linear order in the flux. For instance, some\nof the former massless modes, like the graviton, seem to become massive and\nsome even tachyonic. This is conceptually consistent with the observation\nthat the vertex operator of the \"graviton\"\n\u0001\nVG (z, z) = Gab : J a J b exp ip * X\n(32)\nis generically not any longer a primary field of conformal dimension one and\ntherefore not a physical state.\nSo far, only correlation functions involving tachyons were analyzed. In\ncontrast to the open string case, one expects that vertex operators of the\n11\n\n\fform (32) will also contain new contractions between the H/R-flux and the\npolarizations. Recall that for the open string they were absent, as \u03b8ab was\nmultiplied by a piecewise constant function (see eq.(1)). This is clearly not\ntrue for the Rogers dilogarithm.\nLet me close with another observation. Ignoring for the moment that the\ngraviton G and the analogously defined two-form B vertex operators (32) are\nnot physical, the computation of the hGGBi, hBGBi scattering amplitudes\ncontain SL(2, Z) invariant contributions of the schematic form\nH\u2212flux :\nR\u2212flux :\n\nn\nhGGBi \u2243 \u03b8abc Gam pm\n3 Gb Bcn + . . . ,\n\nn\nhBGBi \u2243 \u03b8abc Bam pm\n3 Gb Bcn + . . . .\n\n(33)\n\nFor H-flux the second amplitude is vanishing and for R-flux the first. In\nthe first case, such a term arises from the term H abc Habc in the effective\naction with H = dB. The second amplitude, however, rather suggests that\nthe effective action contains a term Rabc Rabc with Rabc = B am \u2202m B bc + . . ..\nThis is very similar to the form of the non-geometric R-flux as it appears for\ninstance in double field theory [11]. In this context, B is usually denoted as \u03b2\nand is rather a bi-vector than a two-form. Thus, the question arises whether\none can formulate something like an effective action for these non-geometric\nfluxes where the structures presented in this talk might play an important\nrole.\nI deeply regret that all these exciting questions cannot be discussed with\nMax anymore.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like thank Andreas Deser, Dieter L\u00fcst, Erik Plauschinn and Felix\nRennecke for collaboration and many discussions on the material presented\nin this talk.
