Taking this as the hypothesis for this work, we propose a genuine parton\nlevel estimate of the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon, aLBL\n(had). Our quark mass definitions and values are motivated in detail, and the simplicity\n\u03bc\nof our approach allows for a transparent error estimate. For infinitely heavy quarks our treatment is\nexact, while for asymptotically small quark masses aLBL\n(had) is overestimated. Interpolating, this\n\u03bc\nsuggests to quote an upper bound. We obtain aLBL\n(had) < 1.59 \u00d7 10\u22129 (95% CL).\n\u03bc\nPACS numbers: 13.40.Em, 14.60.Ef, 12.20.Ds, 12.38.Bx.\n\nThe E\u2013821 Collaboration at BNL [1] has measured\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a\u03bc \u2261\n(g\u03bc \u2212 2)/2, with an uncertainty of \u2206a\u03bc = \u00b10.63 \u00d7 10\u22129 .\nThis would provide sensitivity\nto new physics scales, \u039b,\np\nas large as \u039b \u223c m\u03bc / \u2206a\u03bc = 4.2 TeV, where m\u03bc is the\nmass of the muon [2]. A new experiment [3] at BNL is approved aiming at even greater (\u00b10.2 ppm) precision and\nimplying a reach up to 7 TeV. Unfortunately, the interpretation of a\u03bc is compromised by large theoretical uncertainties introduced by hadronic effects diluting the new\nphysics sensitivity. These mainly arise from two-loop vacuum polarization (VP) effects, aVP\n\u03bc (2, had), and from the\nthree-loop contribution of light-by-light type, aLBL\n(had).\n\u03bc\nThe calculations of aLBL\n(had)\nbased\non\nchiral\nperturba\u03bc\ntion theory [4, 5] are the only ones to date solidly based\non a systematic expansion. However, the estimated un> \u00b110\u22129 , is significantly larger [5] than the\ncertainty, \u223c\nmeasurement error. There is a variety of model estimates, all supplementing the dominant \u03c0 0 -exchange contribution with other resonance exchanges and \u03c0 \u00b1 -loops.\nCurrent analyzes [6, 7] agree reasonably well on the magnitude (where residual differences are largely understood)\nand the sign of aLBL\n(had). They have reached a high level\n\u03bc\nof sophistication, but the error estimates remain rough\nguesses. There is also an estimate [8] based on the instanton liquid model with a small (< 10%) quoted error.\nIn this work we offer a complementary way to estimate\n(had), with no need to commit to the dominance of\naLBL\n\u03bc\nany particular type of contribution. It is a na\u00efve parton level estimate which is solid in the heavy quark limit\nwhere it matches onto perturbative QCD, but overestimates the light-by-light contribution in the chiral limit.\nTherefore, our approach naturally implies an upper bound\nfor aLBL\n(had), which is very useful in view of the a\u03bc mea\u03bc\nsurement lying above the Standard Model prediction. It\ncan also be applied to aVP\n\u03bc (had), which serves as a reference case and allows for a transparent error estimate.\nAttempting to obtain aLBL\n(had) directly at the par\u03bc\nton level seems hopeless at first since perturbative QCD\ncannot be applied except for the heavy c and b quarks.\n\nMoreover, in the chiral limit, in which the bulk of the\neffect arises from light, charged, and essentially pointlike pseudo-Goldstone bosons, one has aLBL\n(had) < 0\n\u03bc\nfrom scalar QED [9], while leptons and heavy quarks\ncontribute positively [10]. However, as shown in Ref. [7],\nthe \u03c0 \u00b1 -loops receive large chiral symmetry breaking corrections, rendering the net \u03c0 \u00b1 -contribution almost negligible. Thus, at least as far as aLBL\n(had) is concerned,\n\u03bc\nwe are dealing with a kinematic regime that conceivably admits an alternative description in terms of quark\nin place of chiral degrees of freedom. Indeed, an estimate [7] of the typical momenta, \u03bc, in the \u03c0 \u00b1 -loops yields\n\u03bc \u223c 4.25 m\u03c0 \u2248 0.6 GeV, i.e. large enough to feel individual partons even within pions. These observations\nrevive the question whether hadronic light-by-light diagrams are best described by hadrons or by partons or\na mix. We are aware of three parton based attempts\nin the literature. An early approach [11] using exclusively constituent quarks [12] resulted in a numerical estimate, albeit with the wrong sign. Ref. [13] opted for\na mixed treatment in which constituent quark masses,\nmu,d = 0.33 GeV, ms = 0.5 GeV, and mc = 1.87 GeV\n(with assumed errors of \u00b110%), were employed in the analytical result of Ref. [10] and produced the correct sign.\nThe adopted definition, values, and uncertainty were not\nfurther justified, but in any case the constituent quarks\nwere assumed to yield only the high momentum contribution which was supplemented with \u03c0 0 -exchange graphs\nas described by the chiral constituent quark model [14].\nRef. [15] is very close to both our strategy and philosophy\nand will be commented on below relation (10).\nIndeed, a main obstacle for any model involving quark\ndegrees of freedom at hadronic scales is to find the appropriate quark mass definition. In contrast to pole masses,\nMS masses, m\u0302q (\u03bc) (where \u03bc is the renormalization scale),\ntend to produce small perturbation coefficients (at least\nfor sufficiently inclusive quantities). We will therefore\navoid pole masses for heavy quarks and similarly constituent masses for light quarks. The scale choice is\nimplied by the requirement of avoiding spurious logarithms, ln \u03bc2 /m\u03022q (\u03bc) or ln \u03bc2 /m2\u03bc . They can be nullified\n\n\f2\n(resummed) by choosing \u03bc = m\u0302q (\u03bc) for m\u0302q (m\u0302q ) > m\u03bc\nand \u03bc = m\u03bc for m\u0302q (m\u0302q ) < m\u03bc , i.e. the higher of the two\nmasses sets the scale. There are also genuine logarithms\nof the form ln m\u03022q (\u03bc)/m2\u03bc which cannot be eliminated.\nBut for the light (u, d, s) quark contribution to g\u03bc \u2212 2,\nthe values of m\u0302q (m\u0302q ) or m\u0302q (m\u03bc ) are unknown because\n\u03b1\u0302s and consequently the anomalous quark dimensions\nformally diverge. In a similar context, however, it was\npossible to proceed phenomenologically. Namely, the\nhadronic contribution to the renormalization group evolution (RGE) of the QED coupling (the running), \u03b1\u0302(\u03bc),\ncan be mimicked [16] by effective quark masses. These\nhave been defined more precisely in Ref. [17] as threshold\nquark masses, m\u0304q , and correspond to the scale at which\nthe theory is changed to include or exclude the quark\nq and where the one-loop QCD \u03b2 function coefficient\nchanges correspondingly. Since this is not a perturbative description, higher order QCD effects are assumed\nto be absorbed in the threshold masses, leading to [17],\nm\u0304u = m\u0304d = 176 \u00b1 9 MeV,\nm\u0304s = 305\u221265\n+82 MeV,\nm\u0304c = 1.18 \u00b1 0.04 GeV,\nm\u0304b = 4.00 \u00b1 0.03 GeV,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere isospin symmetry, m\u0302u (m\u0302u ) = m\u0302d (m\u0302d ), was imposed. The uncertainties in the first (last) two lines have\na correlation of \u2212100% (+29%). The values (1\u20134) are\nimplied by the considerations [17] in the next paragraph.\nHeavy quark masses are qualitatively given by one\nhalf of the mass, M1S , of the corresponding 1S quarkonium resonance. If the quark is heavy enough that\nQCD perturbation theory can be applied, this statement can be made quantitative resulting in well studied QCD sum rules [18, 19], which are dominated by the\n1S-quarkonium resonance and supplemented by higher\nvector resonances and a continuum contribution. They\nyield expressions for m\u0302q (m\u0302q ) with small QCD corrections\nwhich are known [20] and included up to order \u03b12s . The\nthreshold masses in Eqs. (3\u20134) can then be obtained in\nterms of these using Eq. (32) in Ref. [17]. Defining the\nparameter, \u03beq = 2m\u0304q /M1S [17], we have that asymptotically \u03beq \u2192 1 for m\u0304q \u2192 \u221e and \u03beq \u2192 0 for m\u0304q \u2192 0.\nThus, for a heavy quark \u03beq \u223c 1, while for a light quark\n\u03beq \u226a 1. Also, we expect m\u03041 < m\u03042 =\u21d2 \u03be1 < \u03be2 , which\ncan be checked explicitly by comparing \u03beb = 0.845\u00b10.006\nwith \u03bec = 0.76 \u00b1 0.03. This implies the upper bound\n\u03bes < \u03bec . A lower bound, \u03bes > 0.47, can be obtained by\nconsidering the SU (3) limit, \u03beu = \u03bed = \u03bes . Since the\ntotal contribution to the running of \u03b1 due to u, d, and s\nquarks is known experimentally [34], this (together with\nisospin symmetry) implies Eq. (2). Assuming in addition\nthe suppression of flavor singlet contributions (the OZI\nrule [35]) then implies Eq. (1) and explains the complete\nanti-correlation with Eq. (2). Isospin violations will, of\ncourse, induce a small mass difference, m\u0304d \u2212 m\u0304u .\n\nIn Ref. [17] the threshold masses (1\u20134) were used for\nthe RGE of the weak mixing angle, sin2 \u03b8\u0302(\u03bc), which is\nrigorously justified as the same vector current correlator\nconvoluted by the same weight function enters in both,\n\u03b1\u0302(\u03bc) and sin2 \u03b8\u0302(\u03bc). What we are proposing here, is that\naLBL\n(had) can be modeled by treating quarks like massive\n\u03bc\nleptons and using the values (1\u20134). Notice, that these\nvalues are systematically lower than typical constituent\nmasses [12], which is reasonable since we do not add an\nindependent contribution from pion degrees of freedom.\nIt is a priori not obvious that this procedure and\nthese values for the quark masses (in fact, any set of\nvalues) will generate the correct aLBL\n(had), but this rep\u03bc\nresents the only ad hoc model assumption that we need\nto make. One justification is the observation mentioned\nbefore, that the relevant kinematic region conceivably admits a description in terms of quark degrees of freedom,\nwhich is reinforced by the lower bounds, \u03bes > 0.47 and\n\u03beu,d > 0.42, showing that the physical light quark masses\nare midway between the perturbative (\u03be \u2192 1) and chiral (\u03be \u2192 0) limits. Thus, at a qualitative level, both\naLBL\n(had) and the RGE of \u03b1\u0302(\u03bc) appear to be describ\u03bc\nable by moderately heavy quark degrees of freedom.\nAlthough our treatment clearly improves with growing\nm\u0304q and becomes exact for m\u0304q \u2192 \u221e, it is important to\nestablish quantitative tests and to apply our approach to\nphysical quantities for which the answer is known with\nsufficient precision. For this we note that aVP\n\u03bc (2, had) is\ndescribed by the same vector current correlator as the\nRGE of \u03b1\u0302(\u03bc) but is convoluted with a different weight\nfunction, K (1) (s) [21], so that just as in the case of\naLBL\n(had) it is a priori not obvious that our approach\n\u03bc\nand quark mass values will generate the correct answer,\n9\naVP\n\u03bc (2, had) \u00d7 10 = 70.30 \u00b1 0.43 \u00b1 0.88 = 70.3 \u00b1 1.0 (5)\n\nTo arrive at Eq. (5) we averaged the results based on\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation data and \u03c4 decay data which are both\ntaken from Ref. [22]. The second uncertainty accounts for\nthe discrepancy between the two data sets. It is chosen\nto one half of the difference in central values and added in\nquadrature to the first (experimental) one. We compare\nthis result with the analytical expression [23, 24],\naVP\n\u03bc (2, had)\n\"\n\n\u00132n+2\n\u221e \u0012\nX\nX\nm\u03bc\n\u03b12\n2\n\u00d7\nQq\n= 2 NC\n\u03c0\nm\u0304q\nq\nn=0\n\n(6)\n\n#\nn ln(m2\u03bc /m\u03042q )\n8n3 + 28n2 \u2212 45\n,\n\u2212\n(n + 3)(2n + 3)(2n + 5) [(n + 3)(2n + 3)(2n + 5)]2\n\nyielding,\n\u22122.6\n\u22129\n,\naVP\n\u03bc (2, had) = 65.1+4.2 \u2213 0.1 \u00d7 10\n\n(7)\n\nThe first and second uncertainty are induced, respectively, from Eqs. (1\u20132) and Eqs. (3\u20134). Effects due to\n\n\f3\nm\u0304d 6= m\u0304u cancel to first order in aVP\n\u03bc (2, had) (but not\nLBL\nin a\u03bc (had) below) and can be neglected. Notice, that\nthe estimate (7) is in reasonable agreement with Eq. (5)\nand that our central value is below it. This is consistent with the chiral limit, m\u03c0 \u2192 0 with m\u03bc /m\u03c0 fixed,\nunderestimating [36] aVP\n\u03bc (2, had). Indeed, in this limit,\nq\n1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00130.39\n\u0012\n2\n4NC (Q2\nm\u03c0\nm\u03c0\nm\u0304q\nu +Qd )\n\u2248\n,\n\u2192\nm\u03c0 \u2192 0 =\u21d2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n(where \u03bc is a fixed reference scale) so that m\u03bc /m\u0304q \u2192 0.\nCombined with K(s) > 0 this implies a systematic underestimate. The fact that the estimate (7) reproduces\nthe experimental result within about 10% provides phenomenological support for our approach and its use of\nquark degrees of freedom. We can also directly compare\n\u22129\nthe contribution from c quarks, aVP\n\u03bc (2, c) = 1.27 \u00d7 10\nfrom Eqs. (3) and (6), with the analytical result up to\norder \u03b12s originally obtained in the second Ref. [20] in\nthe form given in Eq. (4) of Ref. [25]. Using m\u0302c (m\u0302c ) =\n1.29 GeV and \u03b1\u0302s (MZ ) = 0.1216 \u00b1 0.0017 (corresponding to \u03b1\u0302s (m\u0302c ) = 0.432 and \u03b1\u0302s (m\u0304c ) = 0.473), the latter\n\u22129\nyields aVP\n. Thus, here we underes\u03bc (2, c) = 1.46 \u00d7 10\ntimate the known result by 13%, which is traceable to\ndifferent \u03b1s dependences in the RGE of \u03b1\u0302(\u03bc) and the\nleading O(m2\u03bc /m\u03022c ) term in aVP\n\u03bc (2, had). QCD corrections to the O(m4\u03bc /m\u03024q ) term which are significant only\nfor lighter quarks tend to have a compensating effect, offering a perturbative rationale why our approach seems\nto work better for light quarks than for charm.\nThe success of the test in the previous paragraph may\nbe coincidental. Therefore, we performed three similar\ntests on various three-loop VP effects, aVP\n\u03bc (3i, had), each\nwith a different kernel function, K (2i) (s) [26, 27]. i = a\ncontains an additional photonic correction or muon-loop\nrelative to aVP\n\u03bc (2, had), while i = b (c) corresponds to an\nadditional electron (hadron) loop insertion. Our method\n(in parentheses) reproduces the central values of Ref. [28],\n\u22129\naVP\n(\u22121.82 \u00d7 10\u22129 ),\n\u03bc (3a, had) = \u22122.11 \u00d7 10\nVP\n\u22129\n(+0.99 \u00d7 10\u22129 ),\na\u03bc (3b, had) = +1.07 \u00d7 10\n\u221211\naVP\n(+2.8 \u00d7 10\u221211 ),\n\u03bc (3c, had) = +2.7 \u00d7 10\n\n(8)\n\nwithin 14%, 7%, and 4%, respectively. Note, that these\nrepresent genuine \"hit or miss\" tests involving no adjustable parameters, and all four passed at the 10% level.\nWe finally apply our approach to aLBL\n(had). Our mas\u03bc\nter formula is the one for heavy leptons [10],\naLBL\n(had) =\n\u03bc\n\n\u221e\n2\n2\nX\nX\nX\nm2n\n\u03b13\n\u03bc\nk m\u03bc\n4\nN\n,\nQ\nC\nln\nC\nn,k\nq\n\u03c03\nm\u03042n\nm\u03042q\nq\nq\nn=1\nk=0\n\nwhere C1,0 = 3/2\u03b63 \u2212 19/16, C1,1 = C1,2 = 0, and where\nthe other Cn,k up to n = 5 can be found in Eq. (5) of\nRef. [9]. The central values in Eqs. (1\u20134) then imply\naLBL\n(had) = 1.36 \u00b1 0.13 \u00d7 10\u22129 , where the uncertainty\n\u03bc\n\nis the model error, determined by the 9.5% difference\nbetween the upper end of the range (5) from the central value in Eq. (7). Similarly, the upper and lower error in Eqs. (1\u20132) and (7) correspond to aLBL\n(had) =\n\u03bc\n1.27 \u00b1 0.18 \u00d7 10\u22129 and aLBL\n(had)\n=\n1.47\n\u00b1\n0.04\n\u00d7 10\u22129 ,\n\u03bc\ni.e. model errors of 14.1% and 2.9%, respectively. As\nexpected, b quark effects are negligible, but the contribution from c quarks (usually ignored) turns out to be\n0.04\u00d710\u22129. Although small it might serve as an interesting testing tool of other model calculations of aLBL\n(had)\n\u03bc\nwhich should be consistent with what we have obtained,\nsince our method is solid (up to effects of O(\u03b1s )) for\nheavy quarks. To account for isospin breaking we shift\nm\u0304d by +2 MeV and m\u0304u by \u22121 MeV, increasing all results\nby 0.01 \u00d7 10\u22129 to\n\u22129\n(had) = 1.37\u22120.27\n,\naLBL\n\u03bc\n+0.15 \u00d7 10\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the error covers the three ranges above and is\nconstructed to include the intrinsic model uncertainty.\nAs in any hadronic model there would be additional\nmodel uncertainty if the comparison to other cases (here\naVP\n\u03bc (had)) was regarded as pure coincidence. The result, 1.36 \u00b1 0.25 \u00d7 10\u22129 , of Ref. [7] is the first to take\nshort-distance QCD constraints explicitly into account.\nBy construction, this is a feature of our approach, as\nwell, so it is gratifying that the estimate (9) turns out to\nagree perfectly. Our central value is higher than previous ones [6], which is expected given that in the chiral\nlimit, m\u03c0 \u2192 0 with m\u03bc /m\u03c0 fixed (and presumably also\nwith m\u03bc fixed, but the scalar QED result in this case is\nnot known), we overestimate aLBL\n(had) since \u03c0 \u00b1 -loops\n\u03bc\ncontribute negatively.\nNow we repeat the above analysis with the model\nerrors multiplied by 1.645 to shift from uncertainties\nestimated in a \"1\u03c3 spirit\" to 90% ranges, and find\naLBL\n(had) = 1.37\u00b10.21\u00d710\u22129, aLBL\n(had) = 1.28\u00b10.30\u00d7\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22129\nLBL\n10 , and a\u03bc (had) = 1.48 \u00b1 0.07 \u00d7 10\u22129 , respectively.\nThe upper errors have converged, and since as mentioned\nour approach tends to overestimate aLBL\n(had), we quote\n\u03bc\nas our final result the 95% CL upper bound,\naLBL\n(had) < 1.59 \u00d7 10\u22129 .\n\u03bc\n\n(10)\n\nIn a similar paper [15], a 1-parameter fit to aVP\n\u03bc (2, had)\nresulted in mu = md = ms \u2212 180 MeV = 166 \u00b1 1 MeV.\nThese values are within errors consistent with Eqs. (1\u20132),\nreflecting our statement that aVP\n\u03bc (2, had) and \u03b1\u0302(\u03bc) can\nbe approximated using the same masses. We benefited\nfrom a deeper m2\u03bc /m2q -expansion of aLBL\n[9], lowering the\n\u03bc\nlight quark contribution relative to [15] by \u223c 6%. The\nmost important new aspect here is that the recent scalar\nQED calculation [9] allows us to interpolate between the\nchiral and heavy quark limits. If one can prove (conceivably by lattice simulations) the monotony of the product\nm2q aLBL\n(had) as a function of mq , our bound (10) would\n\u03bc\nbecome rigorous, but this remains a loophole for now.\n\n\f4\nWe stress that it is worthwhile to compute the \u03b1s correction to the heavy quark light-by-light contribution to\na\u03bc to check explicitly its magnitude and more importantly its sign, to compare it to the RGE of \u03b1\u0302(\u03bc), and\nto use it as a refinement of our method. This contribu(6,2)\ntion may be called A2 (m\u03bc /m\u0302q ) and corresponds to a\nsubclass of 60 of the 469 Feynman diagrams contribut(8)\ning at O(\u03b14 ) to what is known as A2 (m\u03bc /m\u03c4 ) with m\u03c4\nreplaced by m\u0302q (m\u0302q ) and one prefactor of \u03b1 by \u03b1\u0302s (m\u0302q ).\nThis is possible with state-of-the-art computer codes [29].\nWe have developed (quark mass definition, scale settings, quark mass values, and uncertainties) what we believe are necessary ingredients for a parton model estimate of aLBL\n(had) and similar quantities. The model has\n\u03bc\nfour key benefits: (i) it is simple and transparent, (ii) it\ncan be tested, as we did successfully using aVP\n\u03bc (had), (iii)\nshort-distance constraints are taken into account by construction, and (iv) it naturally provides an upper bound\non aLBL\n(had) because, as we have argued, our method\n\u03bc\ntends to yield an overestimate and also because the 95%\nupper error is virtually insensitive to our input masses.\nWe would like to compare our approach with celebrated models of low-energy QCD, such as the vector meson dominance model [30], the 1/NC expansion [31], the\nchiral constituent quark model [14], or the extended [32]\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio [33] model. It is not obvious a\npriori that approximations like NC = 3 \u226b 1 [31] or\n\u039bQCD \u226a M\u03c7SB (the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scale) [14], or the dominance of certain resonances [30]\nor operators [32] - while plausible - would generate\nuseful results. But experience showed that they do. The\nassumption made in this work is that for the type of observables considered, parton level effects dominate and\nalmost saturate hadronic loops. It is in line with the\nobservations of Ref. [7], and we found further evidence\nLBL\nfor it in both, aVP\n(had), which passed\n\u03bc (had) and a\u03bc\nquantitative tests with better than expected phenomenological success. This may be interpreted as pure coincidence and, clearly, it is important to submit our method\nto other case studies in the future. More optimistically,\nhowever, our results offer an alternative view on hadronic\nloops and may lead to a rigorous bound on aLBL\n(had).\n\u03bc\nIt is a pleasure to thank Michael Ramsey-Musolf and\nLee Roberts for helpful comments on the manuscript and\nLorenzo D\u0131\u0301az-Cruz and Peter Zerwas for fruitful discussions.
