Introduction\nWaves propagating over the free surface of a layer of water subject to gravity have been\nstudied extensively for well over a century. In his ground breaking paper of 1847, Stokes\nshowed that steady periodic wave trains of finite amplitude are possible, and that their\ndispersion relation depends upon their amplitude [1]. In these wave trains, the effects of\ndispersion and nonlinearity balance, yielding a steady wave form.\nIn the 1960's, it was discovered that if the water is of finite depth h0 and the wavelength\n\u03bb = 2\u03c0/k is sufficiently short, the wave train is unstable. Benjamin and Feir [2] showed\nthat the Stokes wave train is unstable to small modulational or side band perturbations if\nkh0 > 1.363 . . ., and this been confirmed experimentally [3, 4, 5, 6].\nBenjamin and Feir's analysis holds only at early times, just after the instability has\nbegun to develop. Zakharov [7] and later Hasimoto and Ono [8] derived an equation of\nmotion for the envelope of a packet of finite-amplitude gravity waves which remains valid\nlong after the onset of the instability. Their equation - the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n- admits envelope soliton solutions that are intimately related to the ultimate state of the\nfluid surface.\nAlthough it is not yet widely appreciated, there are nontrivial electrical free boundary\nproblems. When an electrical current passes through a piece of solid metal or semiconductor,\ncollisions between the conduction electrons and the atoms at the surface lead to drift of these\natoms. This phenomenon, which is known as surface electromigration (SEM), can cause the\nsurface of a solid to move and deform [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The\nfree surface of a conducting film moves in response to the electrical current flowing through\nthe bulk of the film, in much the same way that flow in the bulk of a fluid affects the\nmotion of its surface. However, the analogy is not perfect - the boundary conditions are\nvery different in the two problems. In addition, metals and semiconductors are anisotropic\nmaterials, and this distinguishes them from fluids as well.\nWaves can propagate over the free surface of a current-carrying film deposited on an\ninsulating substrate, at least in the limit of small amplitude. These waves, whose propagation\nis induced by surface electromigration, are somewhat analogous to gravity waves, and will\nbe called \"SEM waves.\" The linear dispersion relation for these waves has been known for\nsome time [15], and will be discussed briefly in Sec. III.\nIt is natural to ask to what extent the nonlinear behavior of gravity waves is paralleled by\n2\n\n\fthat of SEM waves. To address this question, in this paper I will study SEM waves of finite\namplitude, and slow modulations of these waves. Periodic wave trains of finite amplitude\n(the analog of the Stokes wave) are found, as well as their dispersion relation. If the film\nmaterial is isotropic, the wave trains are unstable for kh0 > 1.609927 . . . and are otherwise\nmarginally stable. The equation of motion for slow modulations of the finite amplitude,\nperiodic wave train is shown to be the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nIt is worth mentioning that SEM is not just of academic interest: In modern integrated\ncircuits, the current-carrying metal lines or \"interconnects\" carry very high current densities,\nand electrical failure can occur due to the effects of SEM. In particular, SEM can cause a\nsmall perturbation at the edge of a metal strip to become a slit-shaped void which propagates\nacross the line until its tip contacts the opposite side of the strip; electrical failure is then\ncomplete [20, 21, 22, 23].\nII. Equations of Motion\nConsider a single-crystal metallic or semiconducting film of uniform thickness h0 deposited\non the plane surface of an insulating substrate. We take the z axis to be normal to the\nfilm-vacuum interface and locate the origin O in this plane. (We will occasionally find it\nconvenient to use another set of Cartesian coordinates (x\u2032 , z \u2032 ) with x\u2032 = x, z \u2032 = z + h0 and\norigin O \u2032 at the substrate surface.) The film's surface z = 0 will be assumed to be a low\nindex crystal plane. A constant electrical current flows through the film in the x direction,\n~ 0 = E0 x\u0302.\nand the electric field within the film is E\nNow suppose that the upper surface of the film is perturbed. Let the outward-pointing\nunit normal to this surface be n\u0302. For simplicity, we shall restrict our attention to perturbations whose form does not depend upon y, so that the height of the film's surface above the\nsubstrate h = h0 + \u03b6 depends only on x and t (Fig. 1). The upper film surface will evolve\nin the course of time due to the effects of SEM and surface self-diffusion. We assume that\nthe current flowing through the film is held fixed.\nClearly, the problem is two-dimensional (2D), and the dependence of all quantities on y\nwill therefore be suppressed. The electrical potential \u03a6 = \u03a6(x, z, t) satisfies the 2D Laplace\nequation\n\u22072 \u03a6 = 0\n\n(1)\n\n~ = 0 on the upper surface and \u1e91 * \u2207\u03a6\n~ =0\nand is subject to the boundary condition n\u0302 * \u2207\u03a6\n\n3\n\n\fFIG. 1: The current-carrying metal thin film. The height of the free surface above the substrate,\nh, depends only on x and t. The outward-pointing unit normal to the free surface is n\u0302, and the\n~ 0.\nelectric field far from the perturbation is E\n\non the lower. More explicitly, we have\n\u03a6z (x, \u03b6, t) = \u03b6x \u03a6x (x, \u03b6, t)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03a6z (x, \u2212h0 , t) = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\nwhere fx \u2261 \u2202f /\u2202x and so forth. If the initial perturbation is localized, we also have\n\u03b6\u21920\n\n(4)\n\n~\n~0\n\u2207\u03a6(x,\nz, t) \u2192 \u2212E\n\n(5)\n\nfor x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and, furthermore,\n\nfor x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and \u2212h0 \u2264 z \u2264 0.\nWe assume that the atomic mobility is negligible at the film-insulator interface, so that\nthe form of that interface remains planar for all time. Further, in the interest of simplicity,\nwe assume that the applied current is high enough that the effects of SEM are much more\nimportant than those of capillarity. The surface atomic current J~a is then proportional\n4\n\n\f~\nto the electrical current at the surface. Explicitly, J~a = \u2212\u03bdMq \u2207\u03a6,\nwhere the \u03bd is the\nareal density of the mobile surface atoms, q is their effective charge, and M, the adatom\nmobility, in general depends on the surface slope \u03b6x . When there is a net influx of atoms\ninto a small surface element, it will move. The normal velocity of the film's free surface is\nvn = q\u03bd\u03a9\u2202s (M\u2202s \u03a6), where \u03a9 is the atomic volume and s is the arc length along the surface.\nTherefore\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\nM(\u03b6x )\n\u2202x \u03a6(x, \u03b6, t)\uf8fb ,\n\u03b6t = q\u03bd\u03a9\u2202x \uf8f0 q\n2\n1 + \u03b6x\n\nwhere \u2202x is the total derivative with respect to x.\n\n(6)\n\n(Since \u03b6 depends on x, we have\n\n\u2202x \u03a6(x, \u03b6, t) = \u03a6x (x, \u03b6, t) + \u03b6x \u03a6z (x, \u03b6, t), for example.) Together, Eqs. (1) - (6) completely\ndescribe the nonlinear dynamics of the film surface.\nIII. Finite Amplitude Periodic Wave Trains\nWe wish to study the propagation of a disturbance whose amplitude is small. To this\nend, we put \u03a6 = \u2212E0 x + \u03c6 and presume that \u03b6 and \u03c6 are of order \u01eb.\nWe shall suppose that the crystal structure is invariant under the reflection x \u2192 \u2212x, so\nthat M is an even function of the slope \u03b6x . As a result, M(\u03b6x ) = M0 (1 + c\u03b6x2) + O(\u01eb4 ), where\nM0 \u2261 M(0) and c is a dimensionless constant which vanishes for an isotropic material.\nIf we work to order \u01eb, the equations of motion are linearized and we find that sinusoidal\nwaves of the form \u03b6 = 2a cos(kx \u2212 \u03c90 t) propagate over the surface. \u03c90 = \u03c90 (k) is given by\nthe linear dispersion relation\n\u03c90 = \u2212\u03b2E0\n\nk2\n,\n\u03c3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2261 qM0 \u03bd\u03a9 and \u03c3 \u2261 tanh kh0 [15]. The corresponding group velocity is\nvg = v0\n\n\"\n\nh20 k 2\n\n\u0012\n\n#\n\n1\nh0 k\n1\u2212 2 +2\n,\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u0013\n\n(8)\n\nwhere v0 = \u2212\u03b2E0 /h0 is the phase velocity of waves of infinitely long wavelength. If the amplitude 2a is not a constant but instead varies slowly with position, the resulting amplitude\nmodulation will propagate with the group velocity.\nThe goal of this paper is to go beyond the linear approximation and study wave trains\nof finite amplitude. To begin, we will find the analog of the Stokes wave propagating over\ndeep water: we will consider the limit h0 \u2192 \u221e and restrict our attention to periodic wave\ntrains with constant amplitude a. These simplifying assumptions will be relaxed in the next\nsection.\n5\n\n\fExpanding \u03b6 and \u03c6 in powers of the amplitude, we have\n\u03b6 = [aE + \u03bc2 a2 E 2 + \u03bc3 a3 E 3 + . . .] + c.c.\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c6 = [\u03bd1 aekz E + \u03bd2 a2 e2kz E 2 + \u03bd3 a3 e3kz E 3 + \u03bd\u03033 a3 ekz E + . . .] + c.c.,\n\n(10)\n\nand\n\nwhere E \u2261 ei(kx\u2212\u03c9t) , \"c.c.\" denotes the complex conjugate, and \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 , \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 and \u03bd\u03033 are\nconstants to be determined. We can take a to be real without loss of generality. \u03c9 must\ndepend on a if the appearance of secular terms at the third order is to be avoided.

In contrast, the phase velocity of small\namplitude gravity waves on deep water increases with amplitude.

Slow Modulation of Finite Amplitude Periodic Wave Trains\nWe will now relax the simplifying assumptions of Section III. Suppose h0 is finite and\nthat the amplitude is a slowly varying function of position. We set\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b6=\n\n\u03b6n E n\n\n(22)\n\n\u03c6n E n ,\n\n(23)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nand\n\u03c6=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere E \u2261 ei(kx\u2212\u03c90 t) and \u03c90 is given by the linear dispersion relation for films of finite\nthickness, Eq. (7). Since \u03b6 and \u03c6 are real, \u03b6\u2212n = \u03b6n\u2217 and \u03c6\u2212n = \u03c6\u2217n for all n.\nBecause the amplitude of the wave is of order \u01eb, the coefficients \u03b6n and \u03c6n are of order\n\u01ebn . We may therefore write\n\u03b6n =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u01ebj \u03b6nj\n\n(24)\n\n\u01ebj \u03c6nj .\n\n(25)\n\nj=n\n\nand\n\u03c6n =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj=n\n\nHere n \u2265 0 and the \u03b6nj 's and \u03c6nj 's do not depend on \u01eb. Note as well that \u03b600 = \u03c600 = 0 and\nthat the \u03b60j 's and \u03c60j 's are all real.\nTo find a steady, periodic wave train (the analog of the Stokes wave), we would take the\namplitudes \u03b6nj to be constants and the \u03c6nj 's to depend on z alone. We will go further, and\nallow the \u03b6nj 's to vary slowly in space and time as viewed from the frame of reference moving\nwith the group velocity. As a result, we will be able to find the steady, periodic wave train\nand investigate its stability as well. (Our analysis closely parallels Davey and Stewartson's\ntreatment of modulated gravity waves [24].) To be explicit, we set\n\u03b6nj = \u03b6nj (\u03be, \u03c4 )\n7\n\n(26)\n\n\fand\n\u03c6nj = \u03c6nj (\u03be, z, \u03c4 ),\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03be \u2261 \u01eb(x \u2212 vg t) and \u03c4 \u2261 \u01eb2 t. The method of multiple scales will be employed, i.e., x,\n\u03be, t, and \u03c4 will be treated as independent variables. Using the chain rule, we see that\nd\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n+\u01eb\ndx\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03be\n\n(28)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nd\n=\n\u2212 \u01ebvg\n+ \u01eb2 .\ndt\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(29)\n\nand\n\nWe now insert our expansions for d/dx and \u03c6 into the Laplace equation (1). This results\nin a series of ordinary differential equations for the \u03c6nj 's. Applying the boundary condition\n(3), we find that\ncosh kz \u2032\n=A\n,\ncosh kh0\n\n(30)\n\ncosh 2kz \u2032\n,\ncosh 2kh0\n\n(31)\n\nz \u2032 sinh kz \u2032\ncosh kz \u2032\n\u2212 iA\u03be\n,\ncosh kh0\ncosh kh0\n\n(32)\n\n\u03c611\n\n\u03c622 = F\n\u03c612 = G\nand\n\n1\nsinh kz \u2032\ncosh kz \u2032\ncosh kz \u2032\n\u03c613 = \u2212 A\u03be\u03be (z \u2032 )2\n\u2212 iG\u03be z \u2032\n+H\n,\n2\ncosh kh0\ncosh kh0\ncosh kh0\n\n(33)\n\nwhere A, F , G and H depend only on \u03be and \u03c4 . It also follows that \u03c601 and \u03c602 are functions\nof \u03be and \u03c4 alone, while\n\n\u2202 2 \u03c601\n\u2202\u03c603\n= \u2212z \u2032\n.\n\u2202z\n\u2202\u03be 2\n\n(34)\n\nThe next step is quite laborious but is nonetheless straightforward, and so I will omit the\ndetails. Inserting our expansions for d/dx, d/dt, \u03b6 and \u03c6 into Eqs.

(48) and (49) are valid for ka \u226a (kh0 )3 \u226a 1. It has been shown elsewhere [25] that the\nequation of motion for small amplitude, long waves is the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation\nv0\n1\n\u03b6t = \u2212v0 \u03b6x + v0 h20 \u03b6xxx + 2 \u03b6\u03b6x.\n3\nh0\n\n(50)\n\nThe KdV equation has finite amplitude, periodic solutions (cnoidal waves) of the form\n\u03b6 = \u22122a + 4a cn2 [\u03c0 \u22121 K(m)(kx \u2212 \u03c9t)|m],\n\n(51)\n\nwhere cn is a Jacobian elliptic function, K(m) is the complete elliptic integral of the first\nkind,\n4a\n\u03c9 = v0 k 1 +\n3h0\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\u22121\nm\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(52)\n\nand m is given implicitly by the following relation:\n2\u03c0 2 a\nmK (m) = 3 2 .\nh0 k\n2\n\n(53)\n\nEqs. (51) - (53) give a good approximate solution to the original equations of motion in the\nlimit that a/h0 and h0 k tend to zero with a/h30 k 2 remaining finite as the limit is taken. If\nthe amplitude of the cnoidal wave is small enough that ka \u226a (kh0 )3 \u226a 1, Eqs. (51) and\n(52) reduce to Eqs. (48) and (49). Thus, in the thin film limit, the nonlinear wave (45) is a\ncnoidal wave of small amplitude.\nThe periodic wave train (44) is marginally stable if \u0393\u039b \u2264 0 but is unstable if \u0393\u039b > 0 [8].\nThis means that for a given value of \u03b1, the periodic wave train is unstable if kh0 exceeds\na critical value we shall denote by \u03c7c = \u03c7c (\u03b1), and is marginally stable for kh0 \u2264 \u03c7c .

Fig. 2 is a plot of 1/\u03c7c (\u03b1) as a function of \u03b1. It is intereresting to note\nthat the smallest value of \u03c7c is obtained for a value of \u03b1 differing just slightly from unity\n(\u03b1 = 0.972 . . .).\nFor kh0 \u226a 1, the product \u0393\u039b is negative, regardless of the value of \u03b1. The periodic wave\ntrain is therefore marginally stable in this limit. This is in accord with the fact that cnoidal\nwaves are marginally stable [26].\nIV. Conclusions\nIn this paper, the electromigration-induced dynamics of small-amplitude disturbances\non a low index crystal surface were studied. Periodic wave trains of finite amplitude were\nfound, as well as their dispersion relation. These wave trains are unstable for kh0 > \u03c7c (\u03b1),\nand are otherwise marginally stable. The value of the parameter \u03b1 depends on strength\nof the material anisotropy, and is equal to 1 if the anisotropy is negligible. For \u03b1 = 1,\n\u03c7c = 1.609927 . . .. For \u03b1 \u2264 \u22121/2 and \u03b1 \u2265 2, on the other hand, \u03c7c is infinite and the wave\ntrain is marginally stable no matter what its wavelength.\nThe equation of motion for slow modulations of the finite amplitude, periodic wave train\nwas shown to be the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. As is well known, this equation is\nexactly solvable for initial conditions that vanish with sufficient speed as |x| \u2192 \u221e [27]. This\nexact solution has an number of consequences for electromigration-induced propagation\nof surface waves. If kh0 > \u03c7c (\u03b1), a localized initial wave packet of arbitrary shape will\n11\n\n\feventually disintegrate into a number of envelope solitons and a small oscillatory tail. These\nsolitons survive collisions with each other with no permanent change except a shift in phase\nand position.\nWhat are the prospects of an experimental test of the theory developed in this paper?\nQuite recently, the SEM-induced dynamics of metal surfaces of large area have received some\nattention, but unfortunately these experiments were carried out on polycrystalline films, and\nso they do not permit a test of the theory [28, 29].\nThe experimental situation is more promising in the case of semiconductors. A number\nof beautiful experimental studies of the SEM-induced dynamics of single crystal silicon films\nhave been carried out, but on initially planar, vicinal surfaces [9, 30]. These studies revealed\nthat a vicinal surface is unstable against step-bunching for one current direction, and that\nit is stable for the opposite current direction. Experimental studies of the dynamics of\nperturbed, low-index silicon surfaces that are subject to high electric fields have not yet\nbeen carried out.\nTo test the theory, a singly-periodic periodic wave structure could be etched into a lowindex silicon surface. After perturbing the surface in this way, a high electrical current\nwould be applied parallel to the ripple wavevector. The subsequent surface dynamics could\nbe imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy, as has already been done for vicinal surfaces.\nThe analog of the Stokes wave would be obtained by etching many parallel ripples into\nthe wafer surface before the application of current. In this way, the amplitude dependence\nof the phase velocity could be determined and compared with the theoretical prediction. To\nobserve the development of an envelope soliton (or solitons), on the other hand, a few tens\nor hundreds of ripples would be etched into the film initially. This would produce a \"wave\npacket\" that would ultimately disintegrate into one or more envelope solitons and a small\noscillatory tail under the action of an applied current.\n\n[1] G. G.
