The Auger collaboration (Abraham et\nal. 2007) found a positive correlation between the arrival directions\nof UHECR with energies grater than 57 EeV and nearby AGNs (in\nthe optical catalogue of Veron\u2013Cetty & Veron 2006). Although this\nresult has not been confirmed by HIRes (Abbasi et al. 2008) and it\nhas been criticised by Gorbunov et al. (2008), it received an important confirmation by George et al. (2008), who considered a complete sample of nearby hard X\u2013ray emitting AGNs detected by the\nBAT instrument onboard Swift. This sample is much less affected\nby absorption than any optical sample although, to identify as such\nan AGN, one relies on optical identification. Moreover, George et\nal. (2008) found a correlation not simply with the AGN locations,\nbut by weighting them for the X\u2013ray flux and the Auger exposure.\nThis association, if real, is surprising, since the large majority of the correlating AGNs are radio\u2013quiet, a class of objects\nnot showing, in their electromagnetic spectrum, any sign of non\u2013\nthermal high energy emission: no radio\u2013quiet AGN was detected by\n\u22c6\n\nEmail: gabriele.ghisellini@brera.inaf.it\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\nthe EGRET instrument onboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (Hartman et al. 1999). Therefore they must accelerate particles (protons, nuclei, and presumably their accompanying electrons) to ultra\u2013high energies without any noticeable radiative emission from these very same particles. Radio\u2013loud AGNs, instead,\ntogether with Gamma Ray Bursts (of both the long and short category) do show high energy non\u2013thermal emission, and have been\nconsidered for a long time better candidates as UHECR sources\n(Vietri 1995; Waxman 1995; Milgrom & Usov 1995; Wang, Razzaque & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2008; Murase et al. 2008; Torres & Anchordoqui 2004 and Dermer 2007 for reviews, and Nagar & Matulich\n2008 and Moskalenko et al. 2008 for the possible association of the\nAUGER events with radio\u2013loud AGNs). Note also that some short\nGRBs could be due to the giant flares of highly magnetised neutron stars (\"magnetars\", as the 27 Dec 2004 event from 1806\u201320;\nBorkowski et al. 2004; Hurley et al. 2005; Terasawa et al. 2005),\nand that, at birth, a fastly spinning magnetar can be much more\nenergetic than when, later, it produces giant flares (Arons 2003).\nThe possibility that GRBs and magnetars are the sites of production of UHECR would directly imply the direct association of\nthese events with (normal) galaxies. In this case the found association of UHECR with nearby AGNs might then be due to the fact\nthat local AGNs just trace the distribution of galaxies. The aim of\nthe present paper is to test this possibility directly correlating the\nlocations of the ultra\u2013high energy Auger events with a well defined, complete, and possibly absorption\u2013free sample of galaxies.\nFor this purpose we use the sample of H I emitting galaxies, com-\n\n\f2\n\nG. Ghisellini et al.\n\npiled using the Parkes 64\u2013m radio telescope (Barnes et al. 2001;\nStaveley\u2013Smith et al. 1996), which is conveniently located in the\nsouth hemisphere, as the Auger observatory. The entire sample covers the portion of the sky visible by Auger, making it possible to\nuse, for the correlation analysis, all the 27 UHECR events with energies larger than 57 EeV detected by Auger, without excluding the\ngalactic plane, as is instead necessary when dealing with AGNs or\noptically selected galaxies. Note that the presence of neutral hydrogen strongly favours spirals (or, more generally, gas\u2013rich galaxies)\nwith respect to elliptical galaxies.\nWe use a cosmology with h0 = \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and \u03a9M = 0.3.\n\n2 DATA\n2.1 UHECR events\nThe Auger Observatory (Abraham et al. 2004, 2008), operating in\nArgentina since 2004, is located at latitude \u221235.2\u25e6 and it has a\nmaximum zenith angle acceptance of 60\u25e6 . The relative exposure is\nindependent of the energy of the detected events and it is a nearly\nuniform in right ascension. The dependence on declination is given\nby Sommers (2001). The Observatory can detect Cosmic Rays from\nsources with declination \u03b4 < 24.8\u25e6 .\nThe available Auger list of UHECR events (Abraham et al.\n2008) comprises 27 events with energies in excess of 5.7\u00d71019 eV\nfrom an integrated exposure of 9000 km2 sr yr. The event arrival\ndirections are determined with an angular resolution of better than\n1\u25e6 . However, magnetic fields of unknown strength will deflect\ncharged particles on their trajectories through space. The advantage of studying the highest energy events is that this deflection is\nminimised, but it can still be up to \u223c 10\u25e6 in the Galactic field.\nThe 27 UHECR detected by Auger are distributed in the range\n\u03b4 \u2208 [\u221261, 9.6] (or at galactic latitudes b \u2208 [\u221278.6, 54.1] \u2013 open\ncircles in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 1. H I Parkes All\u2013Sky Survey (HIPASS) galaxies (solid filled symbols) and the 27 AUGER UHECRs (black open circles) in galactic coordinates. Blue levels corresponds to the AUGER relative exposure. The south\nH I catalogue (HICAT \u2013 4315 sources) and the north extension (NHICAT\n\u2013 1002 sources) are shown by red filled circles and orange stars, respectively. The green lines are 20\u25e6 \u00d7 20\u25e6 boxes centred on the positions of the\nradio\u2013galaxies M87 (near the north Galactic pole) and Cen A.\n\n2.2 HIPASS catalogue\nWe compare the arrival directions of Auger UHECRs with the locations of sources of the H I Parkes All\u2013Sky Survey (HIPASS \u2013 Meyer\net al. 2004). This is a blind survey of sources in H I covering the full\nsouthern sky at \u03b4 < 25\u25e6 which is the same sky area accessed by\nthe Auger Observatory. The full catalogue is composed by a list of\n4315 sources at \u03b4 < 2\u25e6 (HICAT \u2013 Meyer et al. 2004; Zwaan et al.,\n2004) and by its extension to the northern sky up to \u03b4 = 25\u25e6 (NHICAT \u2013 Wong et al. 2006) which includes 1002 sources. All sources\nare shown in Fig. 1 with the 27 UHECR detected by Auger.\nThe HICAT and NHICAT have different level of completeness. To have a catalogue complete in flux at the 95% level, we cut\nthe HICAT at Sint > 7.4 Jy km s\u22121 and the NHICAT at Sint > 15\nJy km s\u22121 as discussed in Zwaan et al. (2004) and Wong et al.\n(2006). Sint represents the total H I line flux. For the purposes of\nthis paper we also considered the H I sources within 100 Mpc which\nis the maximum distance at which UHECRs of E > 57 EeV can\nsurvive the GZK suppression effect (see e.g. Harari et al. 2006). We\ncall this sample 95HIPASS: it contains 2414 sources from the HICAT and 290 sources from the NHICAT for a total of 2704 sources\nand covers the entire sky at \u03b4 < 25\u25e6 . We will also consider the\nsouthern sky sample alone which is more complete and can be cut\nat 99% completeness for Sint > 9.4 Jy km s\u22121 (also by considering sources at <100 Mpc). This sample contains 1946 sources and\nis called 99HICAT.\n\nFigure 2. HIPASS galaxy H I flux, in galactic coordinates. Blue levels corresponds to the integrated flux (in bins of 2\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 and units of Jy km s\u22121 )\nof H I emission, multiplied by the relative AUGER exposure. Red circles\nare the locations of the 27 AUGER UHECRs above 57 EeV.\n\n3 ANALYSIS\nTo quantify the possible correlation between UHECR Auger events\nand the distribution of H I local galaxies we use the method adopted\nby George et al. (2008). In order to quantify the probability that\ntwo sets of sources are drawn from the same parent population\nof objects we perform the two-dimensional generalisation of the\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K\u2013S) test (Peacock 1983) proposed by\nFasano & Franceschini (1987).\nIn our case the test is used to compare two data samples, i.e.\nthe UHECR and the H I galaxies. This test can then measure either\nif UHECRs have a galaxy counterpart, and, viceversa, if a concentration of galaxies has an UHECR counterpart. The test relies on the\nstatistic D, also used for the unidimensional K\u2013S test, which reprec 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSources of UHECRs\nsents the maximum difference between the cumulative distributions\nof the two data samples. For each UHECR data point j we compute\na set of four numbers dj,i (i=[1,4]) defined as the difference of the\nrelative fraction of UHECR and H I galaxies found in the four natural quadrants defined around point j. Hence, D \u221a\n= max(dj,i ) for\nall the data points considered. Defining Zn = D n, the strength\nof the correlation between two catalogues is the integral probability\n\u221a\ndistribution P (D n > observed), where n = N1 N2 /(N1 +N2 ),\nand N1 and N2 are the number of data points in the two sets. This\nmeasurement can be used to determine the similarity of sets of positions on the sky.\nThe probability can be computed analytically for large data\nsets (n >80 \u2013 Fasano & Franceschini 1987). In our case, having\nonly 27 UHECR, we have to rely on Monte Carlo simulations. We\ngenerate a large set of random UHECR events according to the relative Auger exposure. For each synthetic UHECR sample we compute Zn by correlating it with the catalogue of H I galaxies. The\nprobability of the observed Zn is given by the number of times we\nfind a value of Zn larger than the observed one. This is the probability that the correlation between the (real) UHECR sample and the\nH I galaxies is not by chance. Large (low) values of the probability\nindicate a good (poor) correlation between the Auger UHECRs and\nthe given H I galaxy sample.\nAs noted by George et al. (2008), the two\u2013dimensional K\u2013\nS test can be performed with the number of data points or with\nthe flux of the sources in the comparison sample. In our case D\nrepresents the maximum difference between the number of UHECRs and that of the sum of the galaxies weighted for their flux\nand for the the relative Auger exposure. The advantage of using the\nweighted flux of the sources is that it accounts for their distance.\nGeorge et al. (2008) found that the UHECRs are more correlated\nwith the weighted flux of Swift AGN than with with their position.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the map of the flux of the HIPASS catalogue\nweighted for the Auger relative exposure.\n\n4 RESULTS\nWe found that with the 95HIPASS catalogue (2704 H I sources\ncomplete in flux at 95%) the probability that UHECRs are correlated with H I galaxies is 71.6% by using the weighted flux of\nthe H I sources. Considering the more complete 99HICAT (1946\nH I sources complete in flux at 99%) distributed within 100 Mpc\nand the 25 UHECRs distributed in the same sky region we find\na larger flux\u2013weighted probability of 87.8%. This probability is\nslightly smaller than found with local AGN by George et al. (2008).\nHowever, having a large sample of H I galaxies we can study\nif the correlation probability changes by considering different sub\u2013\nsamples of galaxies selected according to their distance or luminosity. We have considered 4 bins of distance with an equal number of sources (\u223c500) per bin. The correlation probability shows a\nmaximum of 95% (97.8% for the 99HICAT) for sources distributed\nbetween 37.8 and 55 Mpc. We show these results in Fig. 3 (open\ncircles and stars in the bottom panel).\nSimilarly we defined four equally populated luminosity bins,\nor, equivalently, four bins of HI mass content, since we can use\n2\nM/M\u2299 = 2.36 \u00d7 105 DMpc\nSint to estimate the H I mass (here\nSint is measured in [Jy km/s]). We find that the probability (left\npanel in Fig. 3) is maximised by the most H I luminous or massive\n(in H I) sources (98% and 99% for the 95HIPASS and 99HICAT\nsample, respectively, for M > 1.1 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ).\nSelecting those H I galaxies located within two 20\u25e6 \u00d7 20\u25e6\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nboxes centred on the radio\u2013galaxies Cen A and M87 (green boxes\nin Fig. 1), we can show where they lie in the luminosity\u2013distance\nplane in Fig. 3 (orange and green dots, respectively). While there\nis no clustering of points at the distances of Cen A and Virgo, we\ncan see that H I galaxies in the direction of Cen A do cluster at distances of 40\u201350 Mpc, where the Centaurus cluster is. This could\nexplain why some UHECR events appear to be associated with the\nradio\u2013galaxy Cen A, and none with M87: beyond Cen A there is\nthe Centaurus cluster, richer of H I emitting spirals than the Virgo\ncluster. The ratio of the integrated HI fluxes from the two 20\u25e6 \u00d720\u25e6\nboxes (Virgo/Cen A) is 5.9. To this, we have to multiply by another\nfactor 3 for the lower Auger exposure in the direction of Virgo.\nThe sample has too few galaxies beyond 100 Mpc to test the\nGZK effect (that would be revealed by finding no correlation for\nthese galaxies).\n\n5 DISCUSSION\nThe 27 Auger events above 57 EeV, with a total exposure of\n9000 km2 sr yr correspond to an integrated flux, in CGS units:\nFA (E > 57 EeV) \u223c 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\n(1)\n\nThis flux is smaller than the electromagnetic flux that we receive\nfrom nearby radio\u2013quiet AGNs in hard X\u2013rays (see e.g. Tueller et\nal. 2008). We now compare this flux with the expected flux of other\ncandidate sources. We will consider flaring or bursting sources, that\nis impulsive events, but the spreading of the arrival times of UHECRs from a source located at a distance D, \u2206t \u223c D\u03b82 /2c, due to\neven tiny magnetic deflections, ensure that we can treat all candidate sources as continuous. We will estimate the predicted flux in\ntwo different ways.\nFirst, assume that a class of sources is characterised by a pulse\nof emission of UHECRs, of average total energy < E >. Assume\nalso that these events occur at a rate R per galaxy, per year, and consider those events occurring within the GZK radius Dc . We have:\nF =< E >\n\nR\nNg (D < Dc )\n3.15 \u00d7 107 4\u03c0(aDc )2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 3.15 \u00d7 107 is the number of seconds in one year and\nNg (D < Dc ) is the number of galaxies within Dc of L\u2217 luminosity. The average distance of the sources is aDc (a = 3/4 for\nsources homogeneously distributed). Setting the mean local galaxy\ndensity ng = Ng /(4\u03c0Dc3 /3) = 10\u22122 ng,\u22122 Mpc\u22123 we have:\nF \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221257 < E > R ng,\u22122\n\nDc,100\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121\na2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Dc = 100Dc,100 Mpc.\nThe second estimate on the predicted UHECR flux uses the\nelectromagnetic flux as a proxy. Assume that we detect, for a typical member of a class of sources, an average fluence < F >,\nand that there are N events per year. If a fraction \u03b7 of these events\ncomes from sources within Dc , we have\nF =\n\n\u03b7<F >N\n3.15 \u00d7 107\n\n(4)\n\nThis estimate is more appropriate when dealing with sources, such\nas long and short GRBs, whose fluences and occurrences are\nknown, while Eq. 3 is more appropriate when dealing with possible\nsources of unknown electromagnetic output, but predicted energetics and rates, such as newborn magnetars (Arons 2003) or giant\nflares from old magnetars.\nLet us consider the above classes of sources in\n\n\f4\n\nG. Ghisellini et al.\n\nFigure 3. Top left panel: the HI mass (in solar masses) of our galaxies as a function of their distance. The H I mass is proportional to the H I luminosity, and\n2\nis found using M = 2.36 \u00d7 105 DMpc\nSint , where Sint is the integrated flux in [Jy km/s]. Black empty circles are those galaxies forming a complete, flux\nlimited, sample. Orange and green filled circles are galaxies in the 20\u25e6 \u00d7 20\u25e6 boxes centred on the position of the radio\u2013galaxies Cen A and M87, respectively.\nThe distances of these two radio\u2013galaxies are marked by an arrow. At the distance of Cen A there is almost no H I emitting galaxy, and no concentration is\nseen at the distance of M87 (and the Virgo cluster). The H I galaxies lying in the same region of the sky as Cen A show a concentration for distances 40\u201350\nMpc, where the Centaurus cluster of galaxies is. No concentration in distance is seen for H I galaxies in the direction of Virgo. The bottom left panel shows\nthe significance of the 2D K\u2013S test using galaxies in different bin of distances (circles: South sample HICAT; stars: South+North sample HICAT+NHICAT).\nThe top right panel shows the significance of the correlations for different bins of H I content (or, equivalently for different luminosity bins).\n\nturn, starting from short GRBs. In the BATSE catalog\n(cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/batse/BATSE Ctlg/flux.html)\nwe have 490 short GRBs of total fluence 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 erg cm\u22122\nin 9 years of operation. Tanvir et al. (2005) correlated these short\nGRBs with local optically selected galaxies finding that a fraction\nbetween 5 and 25% of BATSE short GRBs might be nearby, i.e. at\nz < 0.025, corresponding to 109 Mpc. Considering that BATSE\nsaw half of the sky and setting \u03b7 = 0.1 we have an average flux\nof 3.9 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Then, if the UHECR flux is similar\nto the electromagnetic one, short GRBs do not match the required\nflux.\nClassical long GRBs (namely, energetic GRBs at z >\n\u223c1) in the\nBATSE sample have a total fluence of 0.024 erg cm\u22122 (for the\nlisted 1490 long GRBs in the BATSE catalog), corresponding to\nan average (all sky) flux of 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , larger than\nthe one given by Eq. 1. However, for long BATSE GRBs, \u03b7 must\nbe much smaller than 0.1, as directly suggested by the paucity of\nnearby events, and by the lack of correlation with nearby galaxies\nand clusters (Ghirlanda et al. 2006). While we cannot dismiss them\nas sources of UHECRs, it seems likely that classical BATSE bursts\nare too distant (but see below).\nConsider now giant flares from relatively \"old\" magnetars.\nThe giant flare from SGR 1806\u201320 of Dec 27, 2004 emitted an\nenergy E \u223c 1046 erg in less than a second. The radio afterglow\nconvincingly demonstrated the formation of a (at least mildly) rel-\n\nativistic fireball. With the current hard X\u2013ray instruments, such\nflares can be detected up to \u223c30\u201340 Mpc (Hurley et al. 2005). Eq.\n3, with Dc,100 = 0.3, and < E >= 1046 erg, would require R \u223c 1\nevent per galaxy per year, while an approximate limit to the rate is\nR < 1/30 yr\u22121 (see e.g. Lazzati et al. 2005).\nFinally, consider fastly spinning newly born magnetars, whose\nrotational energy can exceed 1052 erg, with a rate of R = 10\u22124\nevents per galaxy per year (Arons 2003). With the estimated galaxy\ndensity (ng,\u22122 \u223c 0.7 with L \u223c L\u2217 ; Blanton et al. 2001) there\nshould be 1 event per year within 100 Mpc. If each magnetar produces 1050 erg in UHECRs, then this class of sources can be the\nprogenitor of the Auger events (Eq. 3). This is independent of collimation, since the reduced rate of events pointing at us is compensated by an increase of the apparent energetics. But if an equal\namount of energy is released in electromagnetic form, at energies\ndetectable by BATSE, then they should be a significant fraction\nof all BATSE GRBs. Since the birth of a magnetar should be accompanied by a supernova, these events should be associated with\nlong, rather than short GRBs, for which no associated supernova\nhas been seen. If the radiative output is isotropic, they will all be\nnearby, sub\u2013energetic, GRBs.\nThe required fluence of these sub\u2013energetic nearby long\nGRBs, to match the UHECRs flux, should be\n< F > \u223c 3.15 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u01ebCR\n\nFA,\u221211\nerg cm\u22122\n\u03b7N\n\n(5)\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSources of UHECRs\nwhere \u01ebCR is the ratio of the emitted energy in radiation and\nUHECR. If \u03b7 \u223c \u01ebCR \u223c 1, these events constitute a sizeable fraction of the total fluence of all long BATSE GRBs in one year (which\nis F \u223c 0.024/9 \u223c 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 erg cm\u22122 ).\nSince we know that the large majority of long GRBs are not\nnearby, newly born magnetars should not constitute conspicuous\nevents in hard X\u2013rays. Their fluence must be mostly emitted in another energy range. GRB 060218 (Campana et al. 2006) with an\nenergy of a few \u00d71049 erg, at a distance of 145 Mpc, could be\none of these events, and Soderberg et al. (2006) and Toma et al.\n(2007) already suggested that this GRB was powered by a newly\nborn magnetar. The spectrum of its prompt emission peaked at \u223c5\nkeV, i.e. its fluence in relatively soft X\u2013rays exceeded the 15\u2013150\nkeV fluence. It was also very long, slowly rising, and would not\nhave been detected by BATSE. Soderberg et al. (2006) pointed out\nthat these sub\u2013energetic long GRBs should not be strongly beamed\n(not to exceed the rate of SN Ib,c), and should occur at a rate of\n\u22123\n230+490\nyr\u22121 , corresponding to R \u2248 10\u22125 events per L\u2217\n190 Gpc\ngalaxy per year, about ten times larger than for classical long GRBs\nwhose radiation is collimated into 1% of the sky. According to this\nrate, Eq. 3 would then demand < E >\u223c 6 \u00d7 1050 erg in UHECRs\nto match the observed flux.\n\n6 CONCLUSION\nWe have correlated the cosmic rays with E > 57 EeV detected\nby the Auger Observatory with a complete, absorption\u2013free sample\nof H I selected galaxies. We found a significant correlation when\ncorrelating the H I flux of galaxies of our sample.\nWhen considering the largest 95HIPASS catalogue and the 27\nUHECRs we find a weak correlation (probability of 72%), while\na larger significance (87.8%) is reached if we consider the most\ncomplete 99HICAT sample of galaxies (though with 25 UHECRs).\nThese probabilities are maximised by cutting the H I sample in distance or luminosity bins: it becomes 99% when considering the 500\nmost luminous (or most H I massive) galaxies (1/4 of the sample),\nand 98% when considering the 500 galaxies lying between 38 and\n54 Mpc, where the Centaurus cluster of galaxies is.\nThus there is the possibility that the UHECRs coming from the\ndirection of Cen A are instead coming from the more distant Centaurus cluster. Galaxies of this cluster are richer in H I than Virgo\ngalaxies, explaining why there is no UHECR event from the direction of Virgo.\nThis sample is formed by H I emitting galaxies, therefore it is\nbiased against ellipticals. The found correlation with these galaxies,\nper se, is not disproving the found correlation with AGNs (Abraham et al. 2007, 2008; George et al. 2008), since they also trace\nthe local distribution of matter, as spiral galaxies do. On the other\nhand, it opens up the possibility, on equal foot, that UHECRs are\nproduced by GRBs or newly born magnetars (see also Singh et al.\n2004 who used AGASA events). With the caveat that it is premature, with so few events and big theoretical uncertainties, to draw\nstrong conclusions, we have pointed out that although classical (i.e.\nenergetic) long GRBs and short GRBs have difficulties in producing the required UHECR flux, newly born magnetars can. If so,\nthey could also be a subclass of long GRBs, possibly sub\u2013energetic\nand relatively nearby, powered by fastly spinning, newborn magnetars. The future increased statistics of UHECRs arrival directions\nwill help to discriminate among the different proposed progenitors,\nespecially if there will be (or not) an excess of events close to the\nradio core and/or lobes of Cen A.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the referee for constructive comments.
