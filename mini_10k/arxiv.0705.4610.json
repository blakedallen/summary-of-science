In the non\u2013relativistic case stochastic acceleration can be viewed\nas a diffusion process in position and velocity space and it can be studied using a dynamical\nsystem approach [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In this framework, the diffusive motion of particles in\nturbulent magnetic fields reveals a rich class of nonlinear phenomena, but the influence of\nelectric fluctuations is not well understood, at least not at the same level as for magnetic\nfluctuations. When electric fluctuations are present, the electromagnetic field is not stationary, diffusion in velocity space can occur also in 2\u2013D and it is at least as interesting as the\nusual diffusion in position space. In particular the well known different diffusive regimes in\nposition space, namely standard (i.e. brownian\u2013like) and anomalous diffusion, are related\nin a nontrivial way to diffusive regimes in velocity space [10, 13]. In the present paper we\ninvestigate the diffusive dynamics of test particles subjected to a stochastic electromagnetic\nfield. Electric and magnetic fluctuations are obtained through a random distribution of\noscillating magnetised \"clouds\". Different diffusive regimes are found as the oscillation frequency of the clouds changes, and a nontrivial relationship between diffusive properties in\nposition and velocity spaces is observed.\n\nII.\n\nTHE STOCHASTIC ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MODEL\n\nWe study the non\u2013relativistic behavior of charged particles interacting with a stochastic\nelectromagnetic field, the motion of each test particle being described by the usual equations\nof motion\ndr\n= v,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\ndv\nq\n=\n[E(r, t) + v \u00d7 B(r, t)] .\ndt\nm\n\n(2)\n\nA simple synthetic model for the electromagnetic fluctuating quantities can be obtained using\na vector potential A that lies on the (x, y) plane, namely A = (Ax (r, t), Ay (r, t), 0). In the\n2\n\n\fgauge where the scalar potential is zero, the electric field is given by E = (Ex , Ey , 0) =\n\u2212\u2202A/\u2202t, while the magnetic field lies in the direction perpendicular to the (x, y) plane,\nnamely B = (0, 0, B) = \u2207 \u00d7 A. With these assumptions the particle dynamics becomes\nbidimensional because the z component of the Lorentz force is zero.\nWe consider a model where the electromagnetic fluctuations are due to the superposition\nof electric and magnetic fields generated by magnetised \"clouds\" which evolve in time according to some prescribed laws. While in the original model by Fermi cosmic rays interact\nwith clouds only through usual collisions [1, 10, 11], here we investigate the case where the\nLorenz force acts continuously on a test particle. We consider an L \u00d7 L square as the basic\ncell containing N \"clouds\". We suppose that the basic cell is repeated in space and that the\ntwo components of the vector potential are thus constructed through the superposition\nAx = Ay = A0\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\"\n\n\u03c8(\u03ben ) +\n\nX\n\n#\n\n\u03c8(\u03be \u0303m ) ,\n\nm\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c8 = e\u2212\u03ben , \u03ben = |r \u2212 r n (t)|/R, r n (t) = (xn (t), yn (t)) are the coordinates of the n\u2013th\ncloud , R represents the typical spatial extension of the potential produced by a single cloud,\nand \u03be \u0303m = |r \u2212 r\u0303 m (t)|/R, with r\u0303 m being the coordinates of the obstacles in the neighbours\nof the basic cell. According to the hypothesis that the other cells are duplicates of the basic\ncell, we have that r\u0303 m = r n + (iL, jL) where i and j are integer numbers and at least one of\nthem is non zero. Moreover, in order to simplify the sum in Eq. (3), R and N have been\nchosen in such a way that R is typically smaller than the distance between two nearby clouds,\ntherefore in the summation\n\nP\n\nm\n\nof Eq. (3) it is sufficient to consider only the eight nearest\n\nneighours of the basic cell (i.e. (i, j) = (\u00b11, 0), (0, \u00b11), (\u00b11, \u00b11), (\u22131, \u00b11) ). Since we are\ninterested in investigating the diffusive properties of the model and not in reproducing the\ndetailed properties of cosmic rays, at variance with the model by Fermi [1] where clouds are\nallowed to move with a given bulk speed, here the motion of the obstacles has been chosen\nto be sinusoidal along both x and y. That is, the coordinates of the n-th obstacle xn (t) and\nyn (t) are given by\nxn (t) = xn0 + an cos[\u03c9n t + \u03b1n ]\n\n(4)\n\nyn (t) = yn0 + bn sin[\u03c9n t + \u03b2n ] ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere xn0 and yn0 are the initial coordinates of the n-th obstacle, an and bn are the amplitudes of the oscillations of the n-th obstacle along x and y respectively, \u03c9n is the oscillation\n3\n\n\ffrequency, and \u03b1n and \u03b2n are the initial oscillation phases, randomly chosen within the interval [0, 2\u03c0]. For the present paper we choose to keep the problem as simple as possible, so\nthat we used the same values of motion amplitudes and frequencies for all clouds, namely\nan = bn = a and \u03c9n = \u03c9. The N clouds contained in the basic cell are irregularly distributed,\nthat is, with random initial positions (xn0 , yn0 ).\nThe motion equations can be adimensionalised by using the following normalization factors: B0 = A0 /L for magnetic field , \u03c90 = (qB0 )/m for frequency, t0 = \u03c90 /2\u03c0 for time,\nv0 = L\u03c90 for velocity, E0 = A0 \u03c90 for electric field respectively, so that finally Eq. (2) can\nbe written as\ndv\n= E(r, t) + v \u00d7 B(r, t) ,\ndt\nwhere\nB(r, t) =\n\nX\nn\n\nEi (r, t) =\n\nX\nn\n\n1 \u2202\u03c8\nR \u2202\u03ben\n\n(\n\n1 \u2202\u03c8\nR \u2202\u03ben\n\n(\n\n(6)\n)\n\n[x \u2212 xn (t)] \u2212 [y \u2212 yn (t)]\n+ N.T.\n|r \u2212 r n (t)|\n\n(7)\n\n)\n\n(8)\n\n[x \u2212 xn (t)]dotxn (t) + [y \u2212 yn (t)]dotyn (t)\nei + N.T.\n|r \u2212 rn (t)|\n\nei denotes the unit vector along the i\u2013th direction on the plane, and N.T. stands for the\nsimilar terms given by the clouds in the nearest cells.\nIn the stationary limit case (\u03c9 = 0) the model is nothing but the electromagnetic reformulation of the celebrated Lorentz model. The only (marginal) difference is the presence of\na smooth potential. For \u03c9 6= 0 one has a sort of Lorentz model where the obstacle positions\nare time dependent. In Ref. [9] a dynamical system study in the case of few obstacles can\nbe found.\n\nIII.\n\nTEST PARTICLE SIMULATIONS\n\nThe model described above is investigated through test particle numerical simulations.\nThe motion equations are solved using a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme. Particles are\ninjected at random positions within the simulation box, with velocities extracted from a 2-D\n2\nMaxwellian distribution P (vx , vy ) \u221d exp[\u2212(vx2 + vy2 )/2vth\n] with vth = 3 \u00d7 10\u22122. Since we aim\n\nto investigate the diffusive properties of the system, all particles have to be tracked for the\nsame time interval. The results shown below are obtained by tracking 6 \u00d7 103 particles using\nthe parameters N = 50, a = 10\u22123 and R = 0.07, while three different values are used for the\n4\n\n\fFIG. 1: Examples of particle trajectories for \u03c9 = 0.01 (left panel) and \u03c9 = 10 (right panel).\n\nfrequency, namely \u03c9 = 0.01, \u03c9 = 1 and \u03c9 = 10. We choose to vary only this last parameter,\nbecause preliminary results have clearly shown that the model is not significantly sensitive\nto variations of a and R. In Fig. 1 two examples of particles trajectories, for \u03c9 = 0.01 and\n\u03c9 = 10 respectively, are shown.\nIn order to study the diffusive properties of the system in both position and velocity\nspaces, the mean square position and velocity displacements are calculated as functions of\ntime, that is, h[r(t) \u2212 r 0 ]2 i and h[v(t) \u2212 v 0 ]2 i, where brackets represent averages over the\nparticle population. In the case of normal diffusion particles make a Brownian\u2013like motion\nand h[r(t) \u2212 r 0 ]2 i \u223c t. On the other hand, if a power law dependence of the mean square\nposition displacements on time is found for long times\nh[r(t) \u2212 r 0 ]2 i \u223c t2\u03bdx ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith \u03bdx 6= 1/2, the diffusion is said to be anomalous, the cases \u03bdx > 1/2 and \u03bdx < 1/2 being\ncalled superdiffusion and subdiffusion respectively. Diffusion in the velocity space can be\nstudied by investigating the scaling of the velocity mean square displacements with time,\nthat is,\nh[v(t) \u2212 v 0 ]2 i \u223c t2\u03bdv .\n\n(10)\n\nThe mean square displacements of position and velocity are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3\nrespectively for the three vales of \u03c9 which are used. The best fits with power laws are also\nshown as solid lines. The values of the \u03bdx and \u03bdv exponents obtained from the fits are given\nin Table I. For \u03c9 = 0.01 the diffusion is nearly normal, since \u03bdx \u2243 1/2 and the velocity\n5\n\n\fFIG. 2: Position mean square displacements for \u03c9 = 0.01 (dotted line), \u03c9 = 1 (dashed line),\nand \u03c9 = 10 (dash-dotted line).

The power law\nexponents obtained from these fits are given in Table I.\n\nFIG. 3: Velocity mean square displacements for \u03c9 = 0.01 (dotted line), \u03c9 = 1 (dashed line), and\n\u03c9 = 10 (dash-dotted line).

The power law\nexponents obtained from these fits are given in Table I.\n\n6\n\n\fTABLE I: Power law exponents \u03bdx and \u03bdv obtained the from best fits of position and velocity mean\nsquare displacements, respectively.\n\u03c9 = 0.01 \u03c9 = 1 \u03c9 = 10\n0.89\n\n1.19\n\n\u03bdv 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 0.42\n\n0.39\n\n\u03bdx\n\n0.49\n\nmean square displacement remains constant after an initial transient. Such an exponent\nvalue indicates that the system is in a standard diffusion regime. For both \u03c9 = 1 and\n\u03c9 = 10 a superdiffusive behavior in position is observed, and the system seems to exhibit\ndiffusion also in velocity, with the velocity mean square displacements showing a power\nlaw dependence. As a consequence of the time correlations, the relation between scaling\nexponents \u03bdx and \u03bdv is not simple [10, 13]. In fact, a straightforward calculation shows that\nh[r(t) \u2212 r0 ]2 i \u2243 2\n\nZ tZ\n0\n\nt\u2212t\u2032\n\nh|v(t\u2032 )|2 iC(t\u2032 , \u03c4 ) dt\u2032 d\u03c4\n\n(11)\n\n0\n\nwhere C(t\u2032 , \u03c4 ) = hv(t\u2032 )v(t\u2032 + \u03c4 )i/h|v(t\u2032 )|2 i. In the classical diffusion process, where acceleration is absent, h|v(t\u2032 )|2 i is constant, C(t\u2032 , \u03c4 ) is independent of t\u2032 and h[r(t) \u2212 r 0 ]2 i becomes\nproportional to t by integrating over t\u2032 . Therefore anomalous diffusion in the position space\nis entirely due to long time tails of C(\u03c4 ). However, in the absence of stationarity the presence of C(t\u2032 , \u03c4 ) makes the scaling exponents \u03bdx and \u03bdv not related in a simple way. In this\nsituation only the upper bound \u03bdx \u2264 \u03bdv + 1 can be derived [10]. When the electric field is\nstrong, or in other words when very strong time correlations of velocities at different times\nare present, the equality \u03bdx = \u03bdv + 1 (i.e. the maximum allowed difference between \u03bdx and\n\u03bdv ) seems to occur [10, 13]. This indicates that the precise relationship between scaling\nexponents in the position and velocity spaces is strongly dependent on the correlations introduced in the model. Different models are characterised by different scaling properties.\nFor example in the model of Vlahos et al. [7], where different correlations are used, \u03bdx \u2243 1.15\nis found for position space diffusion, which is similar to the value obtained in the present\nmodel for \u03c9 = 10, but velocity diffusion is weaker, namely \u03bdv \u2243 0.17 with respect \u03bdv \u2243 0.39\n(cf. Table I).\nThe probability density functions (PDFs) of the two velocity components at different \u03c9,\ncollected at the end of the numerical simulations, i.e. t = 104 , are shown in Fig. 4 together\n7\n\n\fFIG. 4: PDFs of the standardised velocity components at \u03c9 = 0.01 (dotted lines), \u03c9 = 1 (dashed\nlines), and \u03c9 = 10 (dash-dotted lines), collected at the end of the numerical simulations. The\nPDFs at t = 0 are shown as solid lines.\n\nwith the velocity PDFs constructed at t = 0, which are the same in all cases. In order to\ncompare the shape of the PDFs for different \u03c9, the PDFs are calculated after transforming\nthe variables vx and vy into their standardised form by subtracting their averages hvx i and\nhvy i respectively and dividing by the standard deviations \u03c3vx and \u03c3vy (after this transformation the variables have zero mean and unit standard deviation). The shape of the velocity\nPDFs does not change significantly with respect to the initial one, remaining nearly Gaussian. However, the standard deviations of vx and vy increase as \u03c9 increases (see Table II),\ni.e. the velocity distributions become broader.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion we investigated a model of particle diffusion and acceleration in stochastic electromagnetic fields, focusing on the diffusive properties in both position and velocity\nspaces. As the oscillation frequency of the magnetised \"clouds\", which produce the electromagnetic fields, increases, the diffusion in position space goes from a Brownian-like regime\n\n8\n\n\fTABLE II: Standard deviations of the two velocity components collected at the end of the numerical\nsimulations for \u03c9 = 0.01, \u03c9 = 1, and \u03c9 = 10. As a comparison the standard deviations of the\ninitial velocities are shown in the second column.\nInitial \u03c9 = 0.01 \u03c9 = 1 \u03c9 = 10\n\u03c3vx 0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.21\n\n1.49\n\n\u03c3vy 0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.21\n\n1.49\n\nto anomalous diffusion, with ballistic motion for the highest investigated frequency. Correspondingly, diffusion in velocity space also shows a change from Brownian-like behavior to\nanomalous diffusion. However the relation between the diffusion exponents in position and\nvelocity does not seem to be simple, depending on the detailed properties of the time correlation introduced in the model at hand. In the cases where anomalous diffusion is present,\na broadening of the particle velocity distribution is also found, even if their shape remains\nnearly Gaussian. In other words, the anomalous diffusion mechanism at work is associated\nto an energization of the bulk particle population and not to the existence of high energy\ntails in the velocity distribution.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nNumerical calculations have been performed in the framework of HPCC (Center of Excellence for High Performance Computing) of the University of Calabria.\n\n[1] E.
