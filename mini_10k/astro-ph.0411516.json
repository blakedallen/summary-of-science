Our analyses are based on imaging\nperformed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) onboard the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) in the F 606W , F 775W and F 850LP passbands and\nextensive spectroscopic data obtained with the Keck Low-Resolution Imaging\nSpectrograph. Our main results are based on a spectroscopically selected sample\nof 143 cluster members with morphological classifications derived from the ACS\nobservations. Our three primary findings are (1) the faint-end slope of the LF\nis steepest in the bluest filter, (2) the LF in the inner part of the cluster (or\nhighest density regions) has a flatter faint-end slope, and (3) the fraction of\nearly-type galaxies is higher at the bright end of the LF, and gradually decreases\ntoward fainter magnitudes. These characteristics are consistent with those in\nlocal galaxy clusters, indicating that, at least in massive clusters, the common\ncharacteristics of cluster LFs are established at z = 0.83. These results provide\nadditional support for the hypothesis that the formation of galaxies in MS10540321 began at redshifts considerably greater than unity. We also find a 2\u03c3 deficit\nof intrinsically faint, red galaxies (i775 \u2212 z850 \u2265 0.5, Mi > \u221219) in this cluster.\nAlthough the significance is marginal, this trend may suggest that faint, red\ngalaxies (which are common in z < 0.1 rich clusters) have not yet been created\nin this cluster at z = 0.83. The giant-to-dwarf ratio in MS1054-0321 starts to\nincrease inwards of the virial radius or when \u03a3 > 30 Mpc\u22122 , coinciding with the\nenvironment where the galaxy star formation rate and the morphology-density\nrelation start to appear. A physical process that begins to become effective\nat around the virial radius or \u03a3 \u223c30 Mpc\u22122 may thus be responsible for the\nevolution of color and luminosity of cluster galaxies.\nSubject headings: galaxies: clusters: general - galaxies: clusters: individual\n(MS1054-0321, CL1056-03)\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nButcher & Oemler's (1978,1984) discovery that fraction of blue galaxies in clusters\nincreases with redshift first highlighted the significance and strength of the evolution of the\ncluster galaxy population over the past 4 - 5 Gyr. The Butcher-Oemler effect has since been\nconfirmed by many authors (Rakos, Schombert 1995; Couch et al. 1994,1998; Margoniner, de\nCarvalho 2000; Margoniner et al. 2001; Ellingson et al. 2001; Kodama & Bower 2001; Goto\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\net al. 2003a, but also see Andreon et al. 1999,2004). High redshift clusters (z \u223c 0.9) are\nalso observed to have significantly larger fractions of star-forming galaxies than local clusters\n(Dressler & Gunn 1992; Postman, Lubin, & Oke 1998; Dressler et al. 1999; Poggianti et\nal. 1999; Postman, Lubin, & Oke 2001). Blue and star-forming galaxies are clearly more\ncommon in intermediate redshift clusters than in their local counterparts. Furthermore, the\npopulation fraction of S0 galaxies is lower in high redshift clusters (Dressler et al. 1997;\nvan Dokkum et al. 1998; Fasano et al. 2000; Jones, Smail, & Couch 2000; Fabricant et al.\n2000; also see Andreon et al. 1998; Postman et al. 2004) and van Dokkum et al. (1998)\nhave identified a significantly larger fraction of merging/interacting galaxies in the cluster\nMS1054-0321 at z = 0.83. These observations suggest that environmental processes are at\nleast partly responsible for altering the morphology and star formation rates (SFR) of cluster\ngalaxies as a function of redshift. There is likely more than one physical mechanism involved\ngiven the large dynamic range in density over which the morphology-density relation extends\n(Postman et al. 1984; Goto et al. 2003b). However, it has been difficult to specify which\nspecific physical processes are the dominant ones given a limited amount data at key epochs\nover the past half a Hubble time.\nThe cluster galaxy luminosity function (LF) is a fundamental constraint on the mass\nassembly history of galaxy clusters as it is related to the cluster galaxy mass function through\nthe mass-to-light ratio. Precise and accurate measurements of cluster LFs as a functions of\nlocal galaxy density, clustocentric radius, galaxy structure and color have the potential to\nprovide insight into the role of environmental processes in determining the properties of the\npresent-day galaxy populations. The LF is, therefore, central to many cosmological issues\n(Koo & Kron 1992; Ostriker 1993; Binggeli et al. 1998).\nIn the local universe, the cluster galaxy LFs have been studied in considerable detail\nat optical and near-infrared wavelengths (e.g., Lugger 1986; Trentham 1998; Garilli et al.\n1999; Paollilo et al. 2001; Mart\u0131\u0301nez, Zandivarez, Merch\u00e1n, & Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2002; CuestaBolao & Serna 2003;De Propris et al. 2003;Lin et al. 2004). Goto et al. (2002b) derived\nthe composite luminosity function of 204 clusters from the \"SDSS Cut & Enhance Galaxy\nCluster Catalog\" (Goto et al. 2002a) in the redshift range from z = 0.02 to z = 0.25 in the\nfive SDSS bands u\u2217 , g \u2217 , r \u2217 , i\u2217 and z \u2217 , and found that the faint-end slope of the luminosity\nfunction becomes flatter toward the redder wavebands, consistent with the hypothesis that\nthe cluster luminosity function has two distinct underlying populations; a population of\nbright ellipticals with a Gaussian-like luminosity distribution that dominate the bright end,\nand a population of faint blue star-forming galaxies with a steep power-law like luminosity\ndistribution, that dominate the faint-end. Indeed, several studies find that cluster LFs are\nbetter described by a sum of two functions; a Gaussian for bright galaxies and a steep\nSchechter function for faint galaxies (Driver et al. 1994; Molinari, Chincarini, Moretti, & de\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nGrandi 1998; Parolin et al. 2003; Mercurio et al. 2003; Dahl\u00e9n et al. 2004), consistent with\nthe above picture. De Propris et al. (1998) derived the H-band luminosity function of the\nComa cluster galaxies, providing further support to the hypothesis of distinct populations:\nintrinsically bright red galaxies and intrinsically faint blue dwarf galaxies. The dwarf-togiant ratio also appears to depend on environment. Several studies (Driver et al. 1998;\nPhillips et al. 1998; Andreon 2001; Dahl\u00e9n et al. 2004) find that dwarf galaxies are more\ncommon in lower density environments in local clusters.\nIt is important to extend these studies to higher redshifts as the evolution of the above\ncharacteristics can provide useful discrimination amongst structure formation and evolution\nmodels. To date, however, only a handful of clusters at z \u223c 1 have been studied in detail\n(Stanford et al. 1997; Benitez et al. 1999; Rosati et al. 1999; Tanaka et al. 2000; Haines\net al. 2001; van Dokkum et al. 2001; Lidman et al. 2004). In addition, most of these\nstudies relied on photometric redshifts to determine cluster membership. The evolution of\nthe K-band luminosity function in the redshift range z = 0.1-0.9 has been studied by De\nPropris et al. (1999). The evolution of the characteristic magnitude K \u2217 of the galaxies, is\nfound to be consistent with a passively evolving population of galaxies formed at zf > 2.\nThe data are not deep enough, however, to constrain the faint-end slope which was fixed at\n\u03b1 = \u22120.9 in the above study (and adopted from the value derived in the H-band for the\nComa cluster). Nakata et al. (2001) extended the study to z = 1.2 by deriving the K band\nluminosity function for the cluster around the radio galaxy 3C324. They also chose to fix\nthe faint-end slope at \u03b1 = \u22120.9 and found a result consistent with what is expected for a\npassively evolving stellar population formed at zf > 2. Toft et al. (2004) studied the K-band\nLF of galaxy cluster RDCS J1252.9-2927 at z = 1.237. They found \u2206Mz\u2217 = 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 mag of\nevolution and a similar shape for the faint-end tail. The main difficulties in studying cluster\ngalaxy populations at z \u223c 1 are, of course, the fainter apparent magnitude of the distant\ncluster galaxies and contamination by non-cluster member galaxies.\nWith the advent of the Advanced Camera Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST), we now have a chance to step forward. As a part of Guaranteed-TimeObservations (GTO), we have observed the galaxy cluster, MS1054-0321 at z = 0.83. A large\ncompanion spectroscopic campaign yielded redshifts for 143 cluster members, eliminating\nthe uncertainties associated with photometric redshift estimation or statistical background\nsubtraction (Driver et al. 1994; Bernstein et al. 1995; Valotto et al. 2001). The superb\nsensitivity and angular resolution of the ACS allows us to classify galaxies morphologically\nto the depth of i775 = 24 mag.\nWe present in this paper our ACS-based LF and its dependence on clustocentric position,\nenvironment, and galaxy properties for the galaxy cluster MS1054-0321 at z = 0.83. The\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\npaper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the observations; in Section 3,\nwe describe the details of the analysis; in Section 4, we present the results; in Section 5, we\ndiscuss the physical implications of our results; and in Section 6, we summarize our work and\nfindings. Unless otherwise stated, we adopt the best-fit WMAP cosmology: (h, \u03a9m , \u03a9L ) =\n(0.71, 0.27, 0.73) (Bennett et al. 2003), giving a scale of 7.62 kpc per arcsec at z = 0.83.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nMS1054-0321\n\nWith a redshift of z = 0.831, MS1054-0321 is the most distant cluster in the Extended\nMedium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) x-ray selected cluster sample (Gioia et al. 1990). It has\n\u22121\na rest-frame x-ray luminosity of LX (2-10keV)=2.2\u00d71045 h\u22121\n50 erg s (Donahue et al. 1998),\nwhich makes it one of the brightest x-ray clusters known. Recent observations with XMM\n(Gioia et al. 2004) find that the X-ray temperature is 7.2+0.7\n\u22120.6 keV, in excellent agreement\nwith Tozzi et al. (2003), Vikhlinin et al. (2002) and Donahue (2004; priv. comm.). MS10540321 has an Abell richness class of 3 and a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of \u03c3 = 1170 \u00b1 150\nkm s\u22121 (Tran et al. 1999). The weak-lensing mass is estimated to be 9.89\u00b10.36 \u00d7101 4M\u2299\n(Jee et al. 2005).\nA significant fraction of cluster galaxies, 17%, are classified as 'merger/peculiar' on\nthe basis of double nuclei (separation < 10 kpc), tidal tails, and distorted morphologies\n(van Dokkum et al. 1999). Interestingly, many of the merging galaxies are red, bulgedominated galaxies with no detected nebular line emission. The fraction of blue galaxies in\nthe cluster, calculated in the same way as the original work by Butcher & Oemler (1978,1984),\nis 0.22\u00b10.05 (van Dokkum et al. 2000), comparable with the mean value determined for\nclusters at 0.3 < z < 0.5 (e.g., Goto et al. 2003a).\n\n2.2.\n\nHST ACS and Keck LRIS Observations\n\nWe have observed MS1054-0321 in the F 606W , F 775W and F 850LP bandpasses (hereafter V606 , i775 , and z850 , respectively) with the Wide Field Channel (WFC) of ACS as a part\nof the GTO program 9290. A mosaic observation was constructed using a 2\u00d72 WFC pointing pattern, with 1, 2, and 2 orbits of integration in V606 , i775 and z850 bands, respectively,\nat each of the four pointings. There was nearly 1 arcmin of overlap between pointings; thus,\nthe core of cluster was imaged for a total of 8 orbits in i775 and z850 . The field of view of\nthe mosaic is 36.51 square arcminutes covering an approximately square geometry with a\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nprojected proper spatial dimension of 2.7 Mpc at z = 0.83. The data were processed with\nthe \"Apsis\" pipeline described by Blakeslee et al. (2003). We use the SExtractor MAG AUTO\nvalue output by the pipeline for our photometric measure. This magnitude is intended to\ngive a precise estimate of total magnitudes for galaxies using Kron's first moment algorithm\n(Blakeslee et al. 2003). We calibrate our photometry to the AB system using photometric\nzero points of 26.48 (V606 ), 25.65 (i775 ) and 24.86 (z850 ). These are uncertain at the \u223c 0.02\nmag level, which has no effect on our conclusions. We adopt a Galactic reddening for this\nfield of AV = 0.0945, Ai = 0.0714, and Az = 0.0521 mag based on the Schlegel et al. (1998)\ndust maps.\nMulti-object spectroscopy of the galaxies in region was carried out on the Keck Telescope using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (Oke et al. 1995). This survey has\nyielded redshifts for over 300 objects, with 143 of these being confirmed as cluster members\n(van Dokkum et al. 2000; Tran et al. in prep.). Spectroscopic redshifts are measured for\n76% of the galaxies brighter than i775 = 22.0 (See Section 3.2). The availability of this extensive spectroscopic database provides a significant advantage in studying the galaxy cluster\nMS1054-0321. To obtain a large number of spectroscopic memberships in galaxy clusters at\nz \u223c 1, a large amount of telescope time is usually required, and thus, most of the previous\nstudies had to rely on the photometric redshift estimation or the statistical background subtraction, both of which were the main source of bias in determining the slope of the LF at\nthe faint end (Driver et al. 1994; Bernstein et al. 1995; Valotto et al. 2001). We exclusively\nuse the spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to construct the LF in MS1054-0321.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nCluster Membership Determination\n\nWe regard the 143 galaxies with 0.81 < z < 0.85 as members of MS1054-0321. This\ncorresponds to a rest-frame spread of \u00b13300 km s\u22121 about the mean cluster redshift. After\ncorrecting to the cluster restframe and subtracting the contribution to the observed velocity\ndispersion from the redshift measurement errors (\u223c 200 km s\u22121 ), we find a line-of-sight\ncluster velocity dispersion of 1131\u00b15 km s\u22121 (measured as a sigma of biweighted mean with\nthe jackknife error estimate). The derived line-of-sight velocity dispersion is consistent with\npreviously published numbers (e.g., Tran et al. 1999; Goto et al. 2004b).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.2.\n\nCorrection for Incompleteness in Spectroscopic Sample\n\nIncompleteness in measuring spectroscopic redshifts (or targeting galaxies for observation) as a function of apparent magnitude must be compensated for in order to extract\nunbiased results. Fig. 1 shows the sky distribution of objects with spectroscopy (circles)\nand all extended objects in the imaging data (small dots). Since we have only performed\nspectroscopic observations in the region defined by the solid lines, we use objects within this\nregion to define and quantify the incompleteness (see van Dokkum et al. 1999,2000; Postman\net al. 2004; Tran et al. in prep. for more details of the spectroscopic observations). Point\nsources are excluded from incompleteness calculations using SExtractor's stellarity index\n(CLASS STAR > 0.5), which assigns a numerical value close to 1 if the object is a point source\nand values closer to 0 if it is an extended object. A slight change in the criterion of the separation between extended and point sources (e.g., using a CLASS STAR value of 0.8 instead of\n0.5 as the threshold) does not affect our results. In Fig. 2, we show the fraction of galaxies\nthat have a spectroscopic redshift among all galaxies in the imaging data as a function of\napparent i775 magnitude. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the completeness is almost independent\nof magnitude in the range of 18.0 < i775 < 22.0, indicating that the spectroscopic survey is\nnot strongly biased and has a high degree of completeness. Regardless, when we measure\na LF in the following sections, we correct for the incompleteness by weighting the observed\ncounts by the inverse of the completeness.\nIn the following analyses, we divide our cluster galaxy sample using various criteria in\nmorphology, environment, and color. When measuring LFs of these subsamples, the incompleteness correction is re-computed using each subsample of galaxies, and then applied to the\nLFs of each subsample accordingly. As an example, we plot the spectroscopic completeness\nfor blue (i775 \u2212 z850 < 0.5) and red (i775 \u2212 z850 \u2265 0.5) subsamples in dashed and dotted lines\nin Fig.2. It can be seen that the completeness is not strongly dependent on i775 \u2212 z850 color.\nWhen we construct a LF in different passbands (V606 , i775 and z850 ), we correct the counts\nusing the incompleteness as a function of magnitude in that passband.\n\n3.3.\n\nQuantifying the Environment of Galaxies\n\nBecause different physical mechanism that act upon galaxies in dense environments have\nefficiencies that vary as a function of density or position, we quantify the LF as a function\nof these variables in a hope of understanding the underlying processes (see a review in Treu\net al. 2003).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.3.1.\n\nLocal Galaxy Density\n\nFor each galaxy, we measure a projected (angular) distance to the 5th nearest galaxy\nusing the cluster members (0.81 < z < 0.85). The number of galaxies (N = 5) within the\ndistance is divided by the circular surface area with the radius of the distance to the 5th\nnearest galaxy to obtain the local galaxy density, \u03a3 (Mpc\u22122 ). When the projected area\ntouches the boundary of the data (Fig. 1), we calculate the density by dividing the area\nwithin the data region. This parameterization is similar to the one used in previous work\n(e.g., Goto et al. 2003b,c; Tanaka et al. 2004). Although our local galaxy density is a\ntwo-dimensional surface density, the contamination from both foreground and background\ngalaxies is zero because we are using spectroscopic information. However, because we do not\nhave spectroscopic redshifts for all the members, our measured density is an underestimate.\nWe use this density only for internal comparisons. We have chosen the 5th nearest to measure\nlocal galaxy density, but we also have confirmed that using up to the 10th nearest neighbor\ndoes not change the main results described below.\n\n3.3.2. Clustocentric Distance\nTo assess dependencies of the LF on position within the cluster, we measure the projected distance to the cluster center, R, for all spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies.\nWe use the position of the brightest cluster galaxy (J2000 RA: 10h 56m 59.99s, Dec: -03d\n37m 36.1s) as the center of the cluster. Using the centroid of the x-ray surface brightness\ndistribution (Neumann & Arnaud 2000) does not significantly change the results. The virial\nradius of the cluster is known to be \u223c1 Mpc (Tran et al. 1999). In Fig.3, we compare the\nclustocentric distance with the local galaxy density. The solid lines connect medians. The\nerror bars are based on the rms in each bin. As expected, there is a fairly good correlation\nbetween these two parameters. Note that clustocentric distance of R =0.9 Mpc corresponds\nto 30-40 Mpc\u22122 in local galaxy density.\n\n3.4.\n\nLuminosity Function Measurements\n\nWe use a non-linear least squares method to determine the best-fit Schechter (1976) LF\nparameters. The LF normalization (\u03c6\u2217 ), faint-end slope (\u03b1), and characteristic magnitude\n(M\u2217 ) are fit simultaneously. The input data for the fitting procedure is a binned, apparent magnitude distribution for the spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, where the\nnumber of galaxies in each bin has been corrected for incompleteness in the spectrscopic\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nsurvey. We use a magnitude bin size of 0.5 mag. The values of the best fit LF parameters\ndo not strongly depend on our choice of the bin size in the range 0.25 < \u03b4m < 0.75. The\nincompleteness correction is determined empirically by dividing the number of objects with\nmeasured redshifts in a given apparent magnitude bin by the total number of galaxies in\nthat same bin. The total number of galaxies in a bin is taken from our SExtractor catalog.\nThe corrected number counts as a function of apparent magnitude are then converted to\nthe corresponding absolute magnitude using a distance modulus of m \u2212 M = 42.86. We\ndo not apply k-corrections for the internal MS1054 LF comparisons. However, whenever we\ncompare our results to those from other studies, a k-correction is applied and the details of\nhow the k-correction is determined are given in Section 5.1. Finally, we divide the corrected\nnumber counts by the effective area of the survey (in units of projected Mpc2 ; see Fig.1).\nAll fits are weighted by the inverse square of the error in the galaxy number in each bin and\nthese errors are determined from Poisson statistics using the original (uncorrected) number\ncounts. The best-fit Schechter parameters for all samples are summarized in Table 1.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nResults\n\nLuminosity Function of Galaxy Cluster MS1054-0321\n\nWith the spectroscopic membership information and parameters to describe the environment of each galaxy in hand, it is straight-forward to construct a LF of the member\ngalaxies. It is desirable to normalize the absolute magnitude to h = 1 for external comparison purposes, and we thus adopt the distance modulus of m \u2212 M = 42.86 at z = 0.83. In the\nupper panel of Fig. 4, we show the LFs of the spectroscopic members. The incompleteness in\nthe spectroscopic sample is corrected for by using the prescriptions described in Section 3.2.\nThe error bars assume Poisson statistics. The overall normalization is shown in Mpc\u22122 ,\nobtained by dividing the corrected counts in each bin by the surface area of the survey. The\ndotted, dashed, and solid lines are LFs in V606 , i775 , and z850 filters, respectively. The best-fit\nSchechter functions (Schechter 1976) are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4. Fits to the luminosity function are performed using a non-liner least square method applied to the corrected\nbinned number counts, where each bin is weighted by its error. The best-fit parameters\nare (MV\u2217 , \u03b1) = (\u221219.59\u00b10.24, \u22121.35\u00b10.13) , (Mi\u2217 , \u03b1) = (\u221220.83\u00b10.16, \u22120.82\u00b10.10), and\n(Mz\u2217 , \u03b1) = (\u221221.47\u00b10.29, \u22120.87\u00b10.15). These results are also summarized in Table 1.\nOur LF parameters are, of course, less accurate than those derived from composite LFs\nfrom many galaxy clusters (e.g., Goto et al. 2002b). Nevertheless, characteristic features\nof cluster LFs can be clearly recognized. In the literature, LFs in bluer bands tend to have\nsteeper faint-end slope, which is clearly seen in Fig. 4. At z = 0.83, V606 filter corresponds\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nto the rest-frame UV light. The difference between the LF in V606 and the LFs in i775 , z850 is\na nice distinction between star-forming and old-passive galaxies. We compare our LFs with\nthose in the literature in Section 5.\n\n4.2.\n\nLuminosity Function as a Function of Clustocentric Distance\n\nWe begin to explore the dependence of the LF on environment by looking for differences\nin the galaxy luminosity distribution as a function of clustocentric distance. In the upper\npanel of Fig. 5, we show the LF in the inner (R < 0.9 Mpc) and outer (R \u2265 0.9 Mpc) regions\nof MS1054-0321. The threshold of 0.9 Mpc is chosen to correspond to the distance where\ngalaxy properties start to undergo significant changes inwards towards the core. The cluster\ncore region with R < 0.9 Mpc has a higher density of bright galaxies and a flatter faint-end\nslope compared to the LF at R \u2265 0.9 Mpc. We fit a Schechter function to the observed data\nand show the results in the lower panel of Fig. 5 along with the errors on each data point.\nThese error bars assume Poisson statistics. The best-fit Schechter parameters are (Mi\u2217 ,\u03b1)\n= (\u221220.92\u00b10.76, \u22121.28\u00b10.35), (\u221220.77\u00b10.24, \u22120.64\u00b10.17) for galaxies with R \u2265 0.9 and\nR < 0.9, respectively (see also Table 1). A steeper faint-end slope is detected for galaxies in\nthe outer part (R \u2265 0.9 Mpc) as compared with the faint-end slope for galaxies in the inner\ncluster region. These trends are in general agreement with the findings in the composite\nLFs of galaxy clusters in the literature (e.g., Goto et al. 2002b). The difference in LFs in\ndifferent environments suggests that the environment indeed plays a role in determining the\nluminosities of cluster galaxies.\n\n4.3.\n\nLuminosity Function as a Function of Local Galaxy Density\n\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 6, we plot the LF of the cluster partitioned by the local\ngalaxy density of 30 Mpc\u22122 . The solid line is for galaxies in regions with \u03a3 \u2265 30 Mpc\u22122\nand the dashed line is for galaxies in regions with \u03a3 < 30 Mpc\u22122 . Again, the criterion of\n\u03a3 = 30 Mpc\u22122 is chosen to correspond to the environment where galaxy properties start\nto exhibit substantial change relative to the field galaxy population (see Section 4.6). The\nLF of galaxies in dense regions has a flatter faint-end slope than in sparse environments,\nconsistent with the results obtained as a function of clustocentric radius. Note that we do\nnot normalize the LFs in Fig. 6 because the sampling volume of each galaxy is different\nas a consequence of the way the local galaxy density is measured (Section 3.3.1). In the\nlower panel, we fit a Schechter function to each LF. The best-fit Schechter parameters are\n(Mi\u2217 ,\u03b1) = (\u221221.43\u00b10.71, \u22121.42\u00b10.25), (\u221220.63\u00b10.15, \u22120.53\u00b10.12) for galaxies with \u03a3 < 30\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nMpc\u22122 and \u03a3 \u2265 30 Mpc\u22122 , respectively. These results are also given in Table 1. Although\nthe errors on the parameters are substantial, the parameter values are consistent with the\ninterpretation that the galaxy LF in dense regions has a flatter faint-end slope.\n\n4.4.\n\nLuminosity Function as a Function of Color\n\nThe i775 filter is particularly sensitive to different stellar populations at z = 0.83 because\nit includes the 4000\u00c5 break. In particular, the i775 \u2212 z850 color does a reasonable job of\ndistinguishing blue, star-forming galaxies from red, passive galaxies in the color-magnitude\nrelation (Homeier et al. in prep.). Fig. 7 shows the color-magnitude relation for the known\ncluster members (filled circles) and for all extended objects in the field (small dots). The\ni775 \u2212 z850 = 0.5 separates well the galaxies in the red-sequence from the other galaxies. A\ndetailed analysis of ACS-based color-magnitude relation in MS1054-0321 will be discussed in\nBlakeslee et al. 2004. The upper panel of Fig. 8 shows the LFs of galaxies with (i775 \u2212 z850 <\n0.5) and (i775 \u2212 z850 \u2265 0.5) by the dashed and solid lines, respectively. The corresponding\nbest-fit Schechter functions are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 8 with best-fit parameters of\n(Mi\u2217 ,\u03b1) = (\u221220.11\u00b10.22,\u22120.09\u00b10.27), (\u221221.92\u00b10.86, \u22121.48\u00b10.23) for red and blue samples,\nrespectively. One potentially interesting difference is that the LF of red galaxies shows a\ndeficit at the faint end Mi\u2217 > \u221219. Similar deficits of faint red galaxies in high redshift\ngalaxy samples have been reported in the literature (e.g., Kajisawa et al. 2000; Nakata et al.\n2001; Kodama et al. 2004; De Lucia et al. 2004). Such a deficit may signal the presence of\ngalaxy population that has yet to evolve into a faint, red phase. We discuss this hypothesis\nand its implication further in Section 5.\n\n4.5.\n\nLuminosity Function as a Function of Galaxy Morphology\n\nIn addition to providing superb quality photometry, a key advantage provided by the\nhigh angular resolution provided by HST and the ACS, in particular, is the ability to classify\ngalaxy morphology out to redshifts as high as z = 0.83. One of us (M.P.) has visually\nclassified the morphology of MS1054-0321 galaxies with i775 < 24 (see Postman et al. 2004 for\nfurther details). We use these classifications here to examine how the luminosity distribution\ndepends on morphology. In Fig. 9, we present a LF of early-type galaxies (E+S0 or T \u2264 0)\nand that of late-type galaxies (Sa or later; T > 0). Our best-fit Schechter parameters\nare (Mi\u2217 ,\u03b1) = (\u221220.76\u00b10.12, \u22120.54\u00b10.13), (\u221220.79\u00b10.79, \u22120.84\u00b10.67) for early- and latetype galaxies, respectively. The best-fit Schechter functions are shown in the lower panel\nof the figure. To highlight some subtle differences, we plot the ratio of morphologically\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nclassified galaxies as a function of absolute magnitude in Fig. 10 with slightly finer bins.\nThere may be a gradual decline of early-type fractions toward fainter absolute magnitudes,\nsuggesting that the cluster LF is dominated by early-type galaxies. Note that at the brightend the fraction of early-type galaxies is somewhat higher than previous estimates (44%;\nvan Dokkum et al. 2000). This is due to a difference in morphological classification process\nas we attempt to assign a Hubble type to galaxies involved in mergers, if at all possible, to\nfacilitate comparisons with work at lower redshift (see Postman et al. 2004 for more details\nin morphological classification).\n\n4.6.\n\nGiant-to-Dwarf Ratio\n\nIn this section, we investigate the giant-to-dwarf ratio (GDR) as functions of color,\nmorphology, clustocentric radius, and local projected density. We calculate the GDR as a\nnumber ratio of giant galaxies (Mi < \u221219.5) to dwarf galaxies (\u221219.5 \u2264 Mi < \u221218.0) using\nthe expression:\nN(Mi < \u221219.5)\nGDR =\n.\n(1)\nN(\u221219.5 \u2264 Mi < \u221218.0)\nThe criterion between dwarf and giant at Mi = \u221219.5 is chosen to correspond approximately\nto the start of the deviation between the faint ends of the color-selected LFs in Fig. 8. Due\nto the large distance to the cluster, we cannot sample the dwarf population as faint as was\nprobed in previous studies (\u223c \u221216.5 mag; e.g., Ferguson & Sandage 1991; Secker & Harris\n1996). Therefore, we take the inverse of the commonly used dwarf-to-giant ratio in order to\nmagnify the subtle change in the parameter. In Fig.11, we show the GDR as a function of\ni775 \u2212 z850 color. The trend seen in Fig. 8 is much clearer here in the sense that the GDR is\nmuch higher for red galaxies, and it gradually declines as the galaxy color becomes bluer. In\nFig. 12, we show the GDR as a function of morphological type. Confirming the trend seen\nin Fig. 9, the GDR is higher for early-type (T \u2264 0) galaxies. These two trends are consistent\nwith the hypothesis that the bright end of the cluster LF is dominated by red or early-type\ngalaxies and the faint end is dominated by blue or late-type galaxies.\nIn previous sections, we have shown that galaxies in the cluster core (or the densest\nregions) show different characteristics from galaxies in the cluster outskirts (or the sparsest\nregions). An important question to ask now is where (in what environment) these changes\nhappen. In Fig. 13, we show the GDR as a function of clustocentric distance. The GDR\nis higher for galaxies in the inner regions of the cluster, consistent with the results shown\nin Fig. 5. In addition, Fig. 13 shows that the GDR rises steeply at R < 0.9 Mpc, and\nflattens outside this radius. Similarly in Fig. 14, we show the GDR as a function of the local\ngalaxy density (\u03a3) defined in Section 3.3.1. The same trend can be seen here. The GDR\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nrises with increasing local galaxy density. At \u03a3 < 30 Mpc\u22122 , the GDR is consistent with a\nconstant. If MS1054-0321 were roughly spherical, the de-projected rise in the GDR at small\nradii would be even steeper. However, MS1054-0321 is far from spherical - as evidenced by\nthe distributions of the X-ray gas (Donahue et al. 1998; Neumann & Arnaud 2000; Jeltema\net al. 2001), the galaxies and the inferred mass (Luppino & Kaiser 1997; van Dokkum et al.\n1999,2000; Hoekstra et al. 2000; Jee et al. 2005).\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nComparison with Cluster Luminosity Functions in the Literature\n\nWe begin our discussion by comparing the derived LF of MS1054-0321 with that for\ncluster galaxies in the local universe. Since the majority of previous work has measured\nthe LFs in the rest-frame B-band, we convert our Mi\u2217 to the rest-frame B-band for a fair\ncomparison. The conversion is reliable since the shift between the sampled rest-frame at\nz = 0.83 in the i775 filter is quite close to the z = 0 B\u2212band spectral coverage. As most of\nthe cluster galaxies have passive SEDs (Blakeslee et al. 2003), we use an elliptical galaxy SED\ntemplate from Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. (2004) in order to compute the transformation to the B\u2212band.\nThe transformed characteristic magnitude for MS1054-0321 in the rest-frame B\u2212band is\nMB\u2217 = \u221220.35 (h = 1). While not all cluster galaxies have the SED of the elliptical galaxy,\nthe uncertainty introduced by using an elliptical SED for the rest-frame conversion is small\nbecause (i) the majority of the galaxies in clusters do exhibit elliptical SEDs and (ii) a spiral\nSED (Sbc in Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. 2004) yields a transformation that differs by only 0.126 mag,\ncomparable to the statistical error.\nPostman et al. (2001) measured MB\u2217 = \u221220.37 \u00b1 0.17 for three clusters with a median\nredshift of 0.859 (all magnitudes we quote in this section are converted to h = 1 and are on\nthe Vega magnitude system), in excellent agreement with our MS1054-0321 results. At low\nredshift, Colless (1989) measured (Mbj\u2217 , \u03b1) = (\u221220.12, \u22121.24) using 14 nearby rich clusters.\nLumsden et al. (1997) found (Mbj\u2217 , \u03b1) = (\u221220.16\u00b10.02, \u22121.22\u00b10.04) at z \u223c 0.1. Valotto\net al. (1997) found (Mbj\u2217 , \u03b1) = (\u221220.0\u00b10.1, \u22121.4\u00b10.1) at z \u223c 0.05. Rauzy, Adami, &\nMazure(1998) studied 28 rich clusters with a mean redshift of 0.07, and found (Mbj\u2217 , \u03b1) =\n(\u221219.91\u00b10.21, \u22121.50\u00b10.11). The transformation from B to bj is B = bj +0.28(B \u2212V ) (Blair\n& Gilmore 1982;Cunow 1993). Since a typical B \u2212 V color is 0.96 for early-type galaxies\n(Fukugita, Shimasaku, & Ichikawa 1995), we use B = bj + 0.27. Applying this conversion,\nwe find 0.46-0.71 mag of evolution in MB\u2217 in clusters between z = 0 and 0.83. We summarize\nthese comparisons in Fig. 15. The results from Dahl\u00e9n et al. (2002) appear to have a\nlarger scatter because we plot each cluster as an individual point. However, some caution\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nis required in the interpretation of any LF evolution because MS1054-0321 is extremely rich\n\u22121\nwith LX (2-10keV)=2.2\u00d71045 h\u22121\n50 erg s , and therefore, is perhaps not a progenitor of the\nwell-studied low redshift clusters.\nOn the other hand, there is significant disagreement between studies on the faint-end\nslope, \u03b1. We find a much flatter faint-end slope. As our study is limited to a single cluster\nsome of the disagreement may be associated with peculiarities inherent to MS1054-0321.\nHowever, the determination of the faint-end slope depends critically on a good background\nsubtraction and reliable completeness corrections. Hence, some of the difference may also\nreflect the fact that our analyses are based exclusively on confirmed cluster members. If the\ndeficit of faint red galaxies at high redshift turns out to be real, then some of the difference\nbetween our slope and the mean faint end LF slope found at lower redshift may also be related\nto this under-represented population component at z \u223c 0.8. The flat slope in MS1054-0321\nmay thus be suggestive of a population of faint red galaxies that is going to be created or\naccreted into clusters between 0 < z < 0.83. A similar lack of faint galaxies at high redshift\nwas reported by Kajisawa et al. (2000) and Nakata et al. (2001) in the 3C 324 field, and by\nDe Lucia et al. (2004) in the ESO distant cluster survey at z = 0.7 and 0.8. The physics\nbehind the origin of such a galaxy population remains to be explored. A hint comes from\nDrinkwater et al.(2003) who finds dwarf galaxies without any disk, possibly tidally stripped,\nin the Fornax cluster (also see Bekki et al. 2003; Mieske et al. 2004). However, Kodama et\nal. (2004) reported the lack of faint red galaxies in the high redshift field regions using the\nSubaru-XMM deep data, and thus, the creation of faint galaxies may not be cluster specific\nphenomena.\n\n5.2.\n\nType-Specific Luminosity Functions\n\nThe dependence of the LF on color and morphology in MS1054-0321 are shown in\nFigures 8, 9, and 10. In the local universe, Yagi et al. (2002) studied LFs of 10 nearby\nclusters and finds that the LF of galaxies with exponential profiles has a steeper faint-end\nslope than that for galaxies with r 1/4 profiles. Similarly, Boyce et al. (2001) studied the LF\nof Abell 868 (z = 0.154) and finds that the presence of dwarf irregular galaxies causes the\nfaint-end slope of the cluster LF to steepen. Goto et al. (2002b) used 204 galaxy clusters\nfound in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Goto et al. 2002a) to construct composite LFs in\nu, g, r, i, and z filters. When they divide LFs by morphology and color, the faint-end of the\nLFs were steeper for late-type (or bluer) galaxies. We also find that the faint-end slope of\nthe LF in MS1054-0321 is always steeper for blue (i775 \u2212 z850 < 0.5) galaxies. These findings\nare consistent with the hypothesis that the bright end of the cluster LF is dominated by red,\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nearly-type galaxies and the faint-end by blue, late-type galaxies.\nConsidering that field galaxies at around z \u223c 1 have very different properties from their\nlocal counterpart (Kajisawa & Yamada 2001; Cross et al. 2004), it is revealing that these\ntypical characteristics of cluster LFs are already firmly established in a high redshift galaxy\ncluster at z = 0.83, suggesting that this massive cluster most likely began to form at redshifts\nconsiderably greater than unity. A study on a large, statistically complete sample of high\nredshift clusters is clearly needed to assess whether the presence of similar LF features is\nwide spread in clusters that existed 6 \u2013 8 Gyr ago.\n\n5.3.\n\nComparison with Field Galaxy Luminosity Functions\n\nTo gain a better picture of how the cluster environment impacts galaxy-scale stellar\nsystems, we should compare our MS1054-0321 LF results to those from low-density regions\nat similar redshifts. Postman, Lubin, & Oke (2001) proposed that the evolution of the\nB-band LFs of field galaxies are consistent with the form M \u2217 (z) = M(0) \u2212 \u03b2 \u00d7 z, where\n1 < \u03b2 < 1.5. Our cluster MB\u2217 roughly agrees with the equation within the errors. Cross et\nal. (2004) have measured LFs of morphologically selected field E/S0 galaxies at z \u223c 0.75\nand find MB\u2217 = \u221220.3 \u00b1 0.3 with \u03b1 = \u22120.53 \u00b1 0.17. In the Subaru Deep Survey, Kashikawa\n+0.01\n\u2217\net al. (2003) derives (MB\u2217 , \u03b1)=(\u221220.18+0.26\n\u22120.63 , \u22121.07\u22120.07 ) for field galaxies at z \u223c 1. Their MB\nis slightly fainter than the value we obtained for the cluster LF. The \u03b1 is much steeper than\nthe cluster value we found. These differences are comparable with the differences we find\nwhen we compare LF of galaxies in the inner region of the cluster with those in the outskirts\nof the cluster, i.e., lower density regions have a fainter M \u2217 and steeper faint-end tail. Again,\nthese results are consistent with the hypothesis that cluster regions are dominated by the\nbright galaxies, and faint galaxies are more numerous in the field regions.\n\n5.4.\n\nLuminosity Segregation: Where Does it Happen?\n\nIn Figs. 13 and 14, we demonstrate that the GDR starts to change at around R = 0.9\nMpc or \u03a3 = 40 Mpc\u22122 . In Fig. 1, the crosses denote the projected positions on the sky of\ncluster members in this transition region with 10 < \u03a3 < 40 Mpc\u22122 . As can be seen, this\ndensity regime corresponds to the outskirts of the cluster. This environment coincides with\nthat where the relative morphological population fractions and star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxies starts to exhibit significant change, at least in z < 0.1 surveys. For example, Goto et\nal. (2003b) studied the morphology-density relation using a large sample from the SDSS to\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nfind that galaxy morphology starts to change around the virial radius (Girardi et al. 1998),\nwhich is quite similar to the environments we found (see also Postman & Geller 1984).\nTanaka et al.(2004) studied the environmental dependence of galaxy SFR using a similar\nsample from the SDSS and found that the SFR starts to change at a similar environment.\nThe passive spiral galaxies -spiral galaxies with very little or no star formation activity -\nare also found to preferentially exist in the same environment (Goto et al. 2003c; Yamauchi\n& Goto 2004). The galaxies in MS1054-0321 appear to follow similar relationship between\ncolor and density/clustocentric radius. Figs. 16 and 17 show the i775 \u2212 z850 color of cluster\ngalaxies as a function of R and \u03a3. The solid line connects median values in each bin. The\ngalaxy colors start to change significantly at around R =0.9 Mpc or \u03a3 =10-40 Mpc\u22122 , which\nis the same environment where the GDR starts to change. Postman et al. (2004) find\nthat the morphological composition of galaxies starts to change at a similar environment at\nz \u223c 1 as well. A substantial volume of evidence thus suggests there is at least one physical\nmechanism that begins to become important at around R =0.9 Mpc or \u03a3 =10-40 Mpc\u22122\nand plays a role in altering the luminosity, SFR, and morphology of cluster galaxies.\nVarious physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this cluster galaxy transformation. These mechanisms include ram-pressure stripping of cold gas by the intra-cluster\nmedium (Gunn & Gott 1972; Farouki & Shapiro 1980; Kent 1981; Fujita & Nagashima 1999;\nAbadi, Moore & Bower 1999; Quilis, Moore & Bower 2000; Fujita & Goto 2004); galaxy harassment via high speed impulsive encounters (Moore et al. 1996, 1999; Fujita 1998); cluster\ntidal forces (Byrd & Valtonen 1990; Valluri 1993; Fujita 1998; Gnedin 2003a,b) which distort\ngalaxies as they come close to the centre; interaction/merging of galaxies (Icke 1985; Lavery\n& Henry 1988; Mamon 1992; Makino & Hut 1997; Bekki 1998; Finoguenov et al. 2003);\nevaporation of the cold gas in disc galaxies via heat conduction from the surrounding hot\nICM (Cowie & Songaila 1977; Fujita 2004); and a gradual decline in the SFR of a galaxy due\nto the stripping of hot halo gas (strangulation or suffocation; Larson, Tinsley & Caldwell\n1980; Bekki et al. 2002; Kodama et al. 2001b; Finoguenov et al. 2003).\nAmong these processes, ram-pressure stripping and the evaporation of the cold gas may\nbe disfavored by our results. Since 0.9 Mpc is almost the virial radius, the ICM density\nwill be too low for these mechanisms to work with any substantial efficiency (Kodama et al.\n2001b; Treu et al. 2003; also see Mamon et al. 2004; Moore et al. 2004). Galaxy-galaxy\nmerging would be consistent with both of the above results. However, for galaxy-galaxy\nmerging to be an efficient mechanism the relative velocity of the merging galaxies must be\ncomparable with their internal velocity dispersion (Makino & Hut 1997). Thus, such mergers\nwould have to take place in infalling, low velocity dispersion groups or at an epoch when the\ncluster mass was still comparable with that on group mass scales. All we can conclude for\nnow is that merging remains a viable explanation, but not necessarily the only explanation,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nfor the observed trends seen in MS1054-0321 as a function of density and position.\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn an effort to gain further insight into the physical processes associated with cluster\ngalaxy formation and evolution, we have explored correlations between the global parameters\nof the galaxy luminosity function and the properties of galaxies in the cluster MS1054-0321\nat z = 0.83. Our study is based on 143 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members imaged\nwith the ACS in the V606 , i775 and z850 filters. Due to the wide field of view and high\nresolution imaging capability of the ACS, we were able to study cluster LFs as a function of\nenvironment, color, and morphology. Our key findings are summarized below.\n1. The faint-end slope of the LFs is steeper in the bluest band (Fig.4).\n2. The LF of galaxies in the inner part of the cluster (R < 0.9 Mpc) has a flatter faint-end\nslope than that in the outer regions (R \u2265 0.9 Mpc; Fig.5). The corresponding trend\ncan be seen when the LF is measured as a function of the local galaxy density (Fig. 6).\n3. The fraction of early-type galaxies is largest at the bright end of the LF and gradually\ndecreases toward fainter magnitudes (Figs. 9 and 10).\n4. The trends seen in (1), (2), and (3) are generally in agreement with observations of local\ngalaxy clusters showing that the cluster core regions are dominated by bright earlytype galaxies. Hence, a LF similar to what is seen at low redshift is well established in\nMS1054-0321, suggesting that, on average, the galaxies in this massive cluster began\ntheir formation at redshifts considerably greater than unity.\n5. When the LF is partitioned by i775 \u2212 z850 color, we find a marginally significant (\u223c 2\u03c3)\ndeficit of faint red galaxies (i775 \u2212 z850 \u2265 0.5, Mi > \u221219). The deficit is inferred as\nwell when we analyze the LF as a function of morphology \u2013 a possible lack of earlytype galaxies in the faintest bin (Fig. 9). If real, these trends may suggest that faint,\nred, early-type galaxies have not been yet created in MS1054-0321. A deficit of such\ngalaxies has not been seen in low-z clusters.\n6. The giant-to-dwarf ratio exhibits a strong radial dependence beginning at around the\nvirial radius or a strong density dependence when the density increases above \u03a3 \u223c30\nMpc\u22122 . The ratio is higher in the inner parts (or higher density regions) of the cluster\n(Figs. 13 and 14). This environment roughly corresponds to the same location where\ngalaxy color and the morphology start to vary significantly with position and density\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n(Figs. 16 and 17). A physical process effective at this environment, such as galaxy\nmerging, may be responsible for the cluster galaxy evolution in these transition regions.\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for providing constructive and insightful comments\nthat have greatly improved the clarity of this paper.

The large\ncircles are galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. The small dots are extended objects in the\nimaging data with i775 < 25. The contours are based on the number density of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. The crosses are cluster members with the local galaxy\ndensity of 10 < \u03a3 < 40 Mpc\u22122 .\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Completeness in obtaining spectroscopic redshift as a function of apparent magnitude in i775 . The number ratio of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift with respect to all the\ngalaxies in the spectroscopic area of the imaging data is plotted against i775 mag. The error\nbars assume Poisson statistics. The bin size is 1.0 mag. The dashed and dotted lines are for\nblue (i775 \u2212 z850 < 0.5) and red (i775 \u2212 z850 \u2265 0.5) samples, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Local galaxy density is plotted against the clustocentric distance.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nV\ni\nz\n\n\u03c6 (Mpc-2)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n-23\n\n-22\n\n-21\n-20\nM-5logh\n\n-19\n\n-18\n\nFig. 4.- The luminosity function of the spectroscopic members in the three ACS filters. The\ndotted, dashed, and solid lines are for V (F 606W ), i(F 775W ) and z(F 850LP ) filters in AB\nmagnitude, respectively. The incompleteness in the spectroscopic sample is corrected using\nthe method described in Section 3.2.
