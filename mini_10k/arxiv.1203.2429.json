JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\nAbstract. In this paper we continue the investigations on the algebraic\nstructure of a finite semigroup S that is determined by its associated upper non-nilpotent graph NS . The vertices of this graph are the elements\nof S and two vertices are adjacent if they generate a semigroup that is not\nnilpotent (in the sense of Malcev). We introduce a class of semigroups\nin which the Mal'cev nilpotent property lifts through ideal chains. We\ncall this the class of pseudo-nilpotent semigroups. The definition is such\nthat the global information that a semigroup is not nilpotent induces\nlocal information, i.e. some two-generated subsemigroups are not nilpotent. It turns out that a finite monoid (in particular, a finite group)\nis pseudo-nilpotent if and only if it is nilpotent. Our main result is a\ndescription of pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroups S in terms of their associated graph NS . In particular, S has a largest nilpotent ideal, say\nK, and S/K is a 0-disjoint union of its connected components (adjoined\nwith a zero) with at least two elements.\n\n1. Introduction\nFor a semigroup S with elements x, y, z1 , z2 , . . . one recursively defines two\nsequences\nby\nand\n\n\u03bbn = \u03bbn (x, y, z1 , . . . , zn )\n\nand \u03c1n = \u03c1n (x, y, z1 , . . . , zn )\n\n\u03bb0 = x,\n\n\u03c10 = y\n\n\u03bbn+1 = \u03bbn zn+1 \u03c1n , \u03c1n+1 = \u03c1n zn+1 \u03bbn .\nA semigroup is said to be nilpotent (in the sense of Mal'cev [8], denote\n(M N ) in [6]) if there exists a positive integer n such that\n\u03bbn (a, b, c1 , . . . , cn ) = \u03c1n (a, b, c1 , . . . , cn )\n\nfor all a, b in S and c1 , . . . , cn in S 1 . The smallest such n is called the\nnilpotency class of S. It is well known that a group G is nilpotent of class\nn if and only if it is nilpotent of class n in the classical sense. Nilpotent\nsemigroups and their semigroup algebras have been investigated in [4]. For\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 20M07, 20M99, 05C25, Secondary:\n20F18.

JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nexample, it is proved that a completely 0-simple semigroup S is nilpotent\nif and only if S is an inverse semigroup with nilpotent maximal subgroups.\nIf S is a semigroup with a zero \u03b8, then obviously an ideal I with I n = {\u03b8}\nis a nilpotent semigroup as well. Several consequences of the (Mal'cev)\nnilpotence have appeared in the literature. For example, in [9] a semigroup\nS is said to be Neumann-Taylor (N T ) if there exists a positive integer n \u2265 2\nsuch that\n\u03bbn (a, b, 1, c2 , . . . , cn ) = \u03c1n (a, b, 1, c2 , . . . , cn )\nfor all a, b, c2 , . . . , cn in S 1 . A semigroup S is said to be positively Engel\n(P E) if for some positive integer n \u2265 2,\n\u03bbn (a, b, 1, 1, c, c2 , . . . , cn\u22122 ) = \u03c1n (a, b, 1, 1, c, c2 , . . . , cn\u22122 )\n\nfor all a, b in S and c \u2208 S 1 . A semigroup S is said to be weakly Mal'cev\nnilpotent (W M N ) if for some positive integer n,\n\u03bbn (a, b, c1 , c2 , c1 , c2 , . . .) = \u03c1n (a, b, c1 , c2 , c1 , c2 , . . .)\n\nfor all a, b in S and c1 , c2 \u2208 S 1 . These classes of semigroups have been studied\nin [6].\nIn [7] we initiated the investigations on the upper non-nilpotent graph NS\nof a finite semigroup S. Recall that the vertices of NS are the elements of S\nand there is an edge between x and y if the semigroup generated by x and y,\ndenoted by \u27e8x, y\u27e9, is not nilpotent. Note that NS is empty if S is a nilpotent\nsemigroup. We state some of the results obtained. If a finite semigroup S\nhas empty upper non-nilpotent graph then S is positively Engel. On the\nother hand, a semigroup has a complete upper non-nilpotent graph if and\nonly if it is a completely simple semigroup that is a band. The main result\nsays that if all connected NS -components of a semigroup S are complete\n(with at least two elements) then S is a band that is a semilattice of its\nconnected components and, moreover, S is an iterated total ideal extension\nof its connected components. Further, it is shown that some graphs, such\nas a cycle Cn on n vertices (with n \u2265 5), are not the upper non-nilpotent\ngraph of a semigroup. Also, there is precisely one graph on 4 vertices that\nis not the upper non-nilpotent graph of a semigroup with 4 elements.\nIn this paper we continue these investigations. We introduce a class\nof semigroups in which the Mal'cev nilpotent property lifts through ideal\nchains. We call this the class of pseudo-nilpotent semigroups. It turns out\nthat a finite monoid (in particular, a finite group) is pseudo-nilpotent if and\nonly if it is nilpotent. Our main result is a description of pseudo-nilpotent\nfinite semigroup S in terms of their associated graph NS . In particular, S\nhas a largest nilpotent ideal, say K, and S/K is a 0-disjoint union of its\nconnected components (adjoined with a zero) with at least two elements.\nFor standard notations and terminology we refer to [3].\n\n\f3\n\n2. pseudo-nilpotent semigroups\nSuppose that I is an ideal of a semigroup S. If S is nilpotent then clearly\nso are the semigroups I and S/I. However in general the converse fails\n(see Example 2.3 in [4]). We will introduce a class of semigroups, called\nthe pseudo-nilpotent semigroups, for which the converse does hold. The\ndefinition is motivated by the following lemma proved in [7].\nLemma 2.1. A finite semigroup S is not nilpotent if and only if there exists\na positive integer m, distinct elements x, y \u2208 S and w1 , w2 , . . . , wm \u2208 S 1 , such\nthat x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ), y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) (note that for\nthe converse one does not need that S is finite).\nFor convenience we call the empty set an ideal of S and thus, by definition,\nS/\u2205 = S.\nDefinition 2.2. A semigroup S is said to be pseudo-nilpotent if\n\u03bbt (x, y, w1 , . . . , wt ) \u2260 \u03c1t (x, y, w1 , . . . , wt ),\n\n(\u03bbt (x, y, w1 , . . . , wt ), \u03c1t (x, y, w1 , . . . , wt )) =\n\n(\u03bbm (x, y, w1 , . . . , wm ), \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , . . . , wm )),\nfor x, y \u2208 S, w1 , . . . , wm \u2208 S 1 , I an ideal (possibly empty) of \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9,\n\u03bbm , \u03c1m /\u2208 I, and non-negative integers t < m, implies that there are edges in\nN\u27e8x,y,w1,...,wm \u27e9/I between \u03bbi and \u03c1i for every 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m.\nSo in some sense the global condition that S is not nilpotent determines\nlocal information, i.e. some two-generated subsemigroups are not nilpotent.\nExamples of pseudo-nilpotent semigroups are nilpotent semigroups and\nsemigroups with complete upper non-nilpotent graphs. Obviously, subsemigroups and Rees factor semigroups of pseudo-nilpotent semigroups are also\npseudo-nilpotent. Hence, the pseudo-nilpotent condition yields restrictions\non the completely 0-simple components of a semigroup. It easily can be\n1 1\n)) is not\nverified that the completely 0-simple semigroup M0 ({e}, 2, 2; (\n\u03b8 1\npseudo-nilpotent.\nNote that if in the definition of pseudo-nilpotent semigroup S one would\nassume that I is an ideal of S and require that there are edges NS/I between \u03bbi and \u03c1i for every 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m then subsemigroups or Rees factors of\npseudo-nilpotent semigroups need not to inherit this condition. Hence the\nrequirement that I is an ideal of \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9\nLemma 2.3. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. If I is an ideal\nof S such that I and S/I are nilpotent, then S is nilpotent.\nProof. Suppose that S is not nilpotent. Then by Lemma 2.1, there exists a\npositive integer m, distinct elements x, y \u2208 S and elements w1 , w2 , . . . , wm \u2208\nS 1 , such that x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) and y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ).\nAs S is pseudo-nilpotent, this implies that there is an edge in NS between\n\n\f4\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nx and y, i.e. \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is not nilpotent. If both x and y are not in I, then\nnone of the elements w1 , w2 , . . . , wm , \u03bbi (x, y, w1 , . . . , wi ), \u03c1i (x, y, w1 , . . . , wi )\n(for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) belong to I, as I is an ideal of S. However, this is in\ncontradiction with S/I being nilpotent. So x \u2208 I or y \u2208 I.\nThe equalities x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) and y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm )\nimply that there exist elements a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 \u2208 S 1 such that x = ayb, y = a\u2032 xb\u2032 .\nAgain because I is an ideal of S, it follows that x, y \u2208 I. Since \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is not\nnilpotent, this yields a contradiction with I being nilpotent.\n\u0003\nThe pseudo-nilpotent condition also includes restrictions on how elements\nin different principal factors multiply. Indeed, for if an ideal I of a semigroup\nS and its factor semigroup S/I are pseudo-nilpotent, then it does not necessarily follow that S is also pseudo-nilpotent. For example, the semigroup\nS = {a, b, c, d, e} with multiplication table1\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\n\na\na\na\na\nd\ne\n\nb\na\nb\na\nd\ne\n\nc\na\na\nc\nd\ne\n\nd\na\na\nd\nd\ne\n\ne\na\ne\na\nd\ne\n\nhas an ideal I = {a, d, e} with I and S/I pseudo-nilpotent. But S is not\npseudo-nilpotent, because there is no edge in NS between b and e but\n(\u03bb1 (b, e, a), \u03c11 (b, e, a)) = (\u03bb2 (b, e, a, a), \u03c12 (b, e, a, a)).\n\nIn [7] an example is given of a finite semigroup that is not nilpotent and\nhas empty upper non-nilpotent graph. The next lemma shows that such an\nexample can not be pseudo-nilpotent.\nLemma 2.4. If a finite semigroup S is pseudo-nilpotent and NS is empty,\nthen S is nilpotent.\nProof. Indeed, suppose the contrary. That is, assume S is not nilpotent.\nThen, by Lemma 2.1, there exists a positive integer m, distinct elements\nx, y \u2208 S and elements w1 , w2 , . . . , wm \u2208 S 1 , such that x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm )\nand y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ). However, as S is pseudo-nilpotent, we get\nthat \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is not nilpotent. This contradicts with NS = \u2205.\n\u0003\nClearly for a finite semigroup we have the following implications\n\n(M N ) \u21d2 (W M N ), (M N ) \u21d2 (N T ) and (M N ) \u21d2 pseudo-nilpotent.\n\nIn [7] an example is given of a finite semigroup S which is (N T ) but not\n(M N ) and with NS = \u2205. So S is not pseudo-nilpotent. Of course a finite\nsemigroup S for which NS is complete and NS \u2260 \u2205 is pseudo-nilpotent but it\nis neither (N T ) nor (W M N ). Recall from Proposition 3.4 in [7] that every\n1In order to check the associativity law for the constructed examples, a software is\n\ndeveloped in C++ programming language.\n\n\f5\n\nfinite semigroup S for which NS is complete and \u2223S\u2223 > 1, is isomorphic with\na completely simple semigroup M({e}, I, \u039b; P ) (in particular it is a band).\nAs all elements of P are equal to e, we have, for all a, b \u2208 S,\na = \u03bb2 (a, b, 1S , 1S ), b = \u03c12 (a, b, 1S , 1S ).\n\nIt follows that such semigroup is neither (N T ) nor (W M N ).\nHence the classes (W M N ), (N T ) and pseudo-nilpotent are pairwise distinct classes containing the Mal'cev nilpotent semigroups (Recall from Corollary 12 in [6] that a finite semigroup is (WMN) if and only if it is (MN).).\nHowever, in the following lemma we show that for finite groups these notions\nare the same.\nLemma 2.5. A finite group is pseudo-nilpotent if and only if it is nilpotent.\nProof. Let G be a finite group. Of course if G is nilpotent then G is pseudonilpotent. For the converse, recall that G is nilpotent if and only if it is\nNeumann Taylor. So assume G is pseudo-nilpotent. We need to prove that\nG is Neumann Taylor. We prove this by contradiction. So suppose G is not\n(N T ). Let k = \u2223G\u2223. There exist distinct elements a, b \u2208 G and w1 , . . . , wk2\n\u2208 G such that\n\u03bbk2 +1 (a, b, 1G , w1 , . . . , wk2 ) \u2260 \u03c1k2 +1 (a, b, 1G , w1 , . . . , wk2 ).\n\nSince \u2223G \u00d7 G\u2223 = k2 there exist non-negative integers t, r \u2264 k2 , t < r with\n(\u03bbt+1 (a, b, 1G , w1 , . . . , wt ), \u03c1t+1 (a, b, 1G , w1 , . . . , wt ))\n= (\u03bbr+1 (a, b, 1G , w1 , . . . , wr ), \u03c1r+1 (a, b, 1G , w1 , . . . , wr )).\n\nTherefore we also have\n\n(\u03bbt+1 (a, 1G , b, w1 , . . . , wt ), \u03c1t+1 (a, 1G , b, w1 , . . . , wt ))\n= (\u03bbr+1 (a, 1G , b, w1 , . . . , wr ), \u03c1r+1 (a, 1G , b, w1 , . . . , wr )).\n\nBecause G is pseudo-nilpotent, it implies that there is an edge in NS between\n1G and a, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nRecall from [7] that the lower non-nilpotent graph LS of a semigroup S is\nthe graph whose vertices are the elements of S and there is an edge between\ntwo distinct vertices x, y \u2208 S if and only if there exist elements w1 , w2 , . . . , wn\nin \u27e8x, y\u27e91 with x = \u03bbn (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wn ) and y = \u03c1n (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wn ).\nClearly, because of Lemma 2.1, LS is a subgraph of NS . In general LS and\nNS are different.\nProposition 2.6. Let S be a finite semigroup. If S is pseudo-nilpotent and\nLS is empty, then NS is empty.\n\nProof. Suppose NS is not empty. Then S is not nilpotent and hence, by\nLemma 2.1, there exists a positive integer m and distinct elements x, y \u2208 S\nand w1 , w2 , . . . , wm \u2208 S 1 such that x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) and y =\n\u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ). Since, by assumption, S is pseudo-nilpotent, we\nget that S1 = \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is not nilpotent.\n\n\f6\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nNote that the subsemigroup S1 is pseudo-nilpotent. Since S1 is not\nnilpotent, there exists a positive integer m1 , distinct elements x1 , y1 \u2208 S1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand w1 , w2 , . . . , wm1 \u2208 S11 such that x1 = \u03bbm1 (x1 , y1 , w1 , w2 , . . . , wm1 ) and\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ny1 = \u03c1m1 (x1 , y1 , w1 , w2 , . . . , wm1 ). Therefore S2 = \u27e8x1 , y1 \u27e9 is not nilpotent.\nLet x0 = x and y0 = y. By induction we obtain for each non-negative\ninteger i a subsemigroup Si of S such that\nS0 = S,\nand elements\n\nSi = \u27e8xi\u22121 , yi\u22121 \u27e9( for i \u2265 1)\n\n(i)\n\u2208 Si1\nxi , yi , w1 , w2 , . . . , wm\ni\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nsuch that\n(i)\n(i)\n)\n), yi = \u03c1mi (xi , yi , w1 , . . . , wm\nxi = \u03bbmi (xi , yi , w1 , . . . , wm\ni\ni\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nand\n\nxi \u2260 y i .\n\nClearly,\n\nS \u2287 S1 \u2287 S2 \u2287 \u22ef\n\nof subsemigroups of S.

Since L\u27e8xt ,yt \u27e9 is\na subgraph of LS , we obtain that the graph LS is not empty, as desired. \u0003\nWe finish this section with proving one more restriction that the pseudonilpotent condition imposes.\nLemma 2.7. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. If I is an ideal\nof S and NI is empty, then elements of I are isolated vertices in NS .\nProof. We prove the result by contradiction. So, suppose that there exists\nan edge in NS between a \u2208 S/I and b \u2208 I. Hence \u27e8a, b\u27e9 = \u27e8a\u27e9 \u222a B, for some\nsubset B of I. Because \u27e8a, b\u27e9 is not nilpotent, by Lemma 2.1, there exists\na positive integer m and elements x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm of \u27e8a, b\u27e91 such that\nx = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ), y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) and x \u2260 y. As the\ncyclic semigroup \u27e8a\u27e9 is nilpotent, we get that {x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm } \u2229 B \u2260\n\u2205. Because I is an ideal, the equalities x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) and\ny = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ) yield that x, y \u2208 I. Since, by assumption, S is\npseudo-nilpotent, we know that \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is not nilpotent, i.e. there is an edge\nin NS between x and y. However, there is contradiction with NI = \u2205.\n\u0003\n\n\f7\n\n3. A description of pseudo-nilpotent semigroups\nWe begin by describing the completely 0-simple semigroups that are\npseudo-nilpotent. The non-zero elements of a completely 0-simple semigroup\nM0 (G, I, \u039b; P ) over a group G are denoted as (g; i, \u03bb), with g \u2208 G, i \u2208 I and\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b. Also, we denote the sets {(g; i, \u03bb) \u2223 g \u2208 G}, {(g; i, \u03bb) \u2223 g \u2208 G, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} and\n{(g; i, \u03bb) \u2223 g \u2208 G, i \u2208 I} by Gi,\u03bb , Gi,\u22c6 and G\u22c6,\u03bb respectively.\nLemma 3.1. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. Assume A and\nB are ideals of S such that A \u2286 B and B/A = M0 (G, I, \u039b; P ) is a regular\nRees matrix semigroup. Then either B/A is nilpotent (i.e. G is nilpotent\nand B/A is an inverse semigroup) or \u2223I\u2223 + \u2223\u039b\u2223 > 2, G is a nilpotent group and\nall entries of P are non-zero (i.e. B/A is a union of groups, and thus B/A\nis a semigroup).\nConversely, any completely 0-simple semigroup M0 (G, I, \u039b; P ), with G\na nilpotent group and all entries of P non-zero, is pseudo-nilpotent. Furthermore, if \u2223I\u2223 + \u2223\u039b\u2223 > 2 and (i, \u03bb) \u2260 (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) then \u27e8(g; i, \u03bb), (g\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 )\u27e9 is not\nnilpotent for all g, g\u2032 \u2208 G. In particular, the upper non-nilpotent graph of\nM0 (G, I, \u039b; P )/{\u03b8} is connected and regular.\nProof. Because B/A is regular, each row and column of P contains a nonzero entry. Lemma 2.1 of [4] implies that if each row and column does not\ncontain more than one non-zero element, then B/A is nilpotent.\nSuppose B/A is not nilpotent. Then, without loss of generality, we may\nassume that some row of P contains more than one non-zero element. Say\npj,i1 , pj,i2 \u2260 \u03b8. If \u039b = {j}, because B/A is regular, all columns are non-zero,\nand hence all elements of P are non-zero. Otherwise, let j \u2032 \u2208 \u039b, j \u2032 \u2260 j.\nBecause B/A is regular, there exists \u03b1 \u2208 I such that pj \u2032 ,\u03b1 \u2260 \u03b8. Now we have\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u22121\n((p\u22121\nj,i1 ; i1 , j ), (pj,i2 ; i2 , j )) = (\u03bb1 ((pj,i1 ; i1 , j ), (pj,i2 ; i2 , j ), (pj \u2032 ,\u03b1 ; \u03b1, j)),\n\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u03c11 ((p\u22121\nj,i1 ; i1 , j ), (pj,i2 ; i2 , j ), (pj \u2032 ,\u03b1 ; \u03b1, j))).\nHence, because S is pseudo-nilpotent, there is an edge in NS/A between\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n(p\u22121\nj,i1 ; i1 , j ) and (pj,i2 ; i2 , j ). Consequently, by Lemma 2.1, there exists a\n\u2032\n\u22121\npositive integer m and elements x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm of \u27e8(p\u22121\nj,i1 ; i1 , j ), (pj,i2 ; i2 ,\nj \u2032 )\u27e91 such that x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ), y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm )\nand x \u2260 y.\nIf pj \u2032 ,i1 = \u03b8 then, for g \u2208 G and working in S/A,\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u27e8(p\u22121\nj,i1 ; i1 , j ), (pj,i2 ; i2 , j )\u27e9(g; i1 , j ) = \u03b8.\n\nHence {x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm } \u2286 Gi2 ,j \u2032 and pj \u2032 ,i2 \u2260 \u03b8, because it is impossible\nthat \u03b8 \u2208 {x, y}{w1 , w2 , . . . , wm } or \u03b8 \u2208 {w1 , w2 , . . . , wm }{x, y}.\nConsequently, the group Gi2 ,j \u2032 \u2245 G is not nilpotent. However, as a subsemigroup of S, it is pseudo-nilpotent and thus, by Lemma 2.5, it is a nilpotent group. This yields a contradiction. So we have proved that pj \u2032 ,i1 \u2260 \u03b8.\nSimilarly pj \u2032 ,i2 \u2260 \u03b8. Thus, pk,i1 \u2260 \u03b8, pk,i2 \u2260 \u03b8 for all k \u2208 \u039b. That is, columns i1\nand i2 of P do not contain \u03b8.\n\n\f8\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nLet i3 \u2208 I. Because B/A is regular, there exists l \u2208 \u039b such that pl,i3 \u2260 \u03b8.\nAs also pl,i1 \u2260 \u03b8, the above yields that column i3 of P also not contain \u03b8. So\nall entries of P are different from \u03b8. This finishes the first part of the result.\nThe second part easily can be verified.\n\u0003\nNext we describe how a completely 0-simple factor fits into a pseudonilpotent semigroup, in particular, we investigate the restrictions on how\nelements in different principal factors multiply. To do so we introduce some\nnotations. Let S be a semigroup with a zero \u03b8. For an ideal J of S let\nand let\n\nFJ (S) = FJ = {s \u2208 S/J \u2223 sj \u2260 \u03b8 or js \u2260 \u03b8 for some j \u2208 J}\nFJ\u2032 (S) = FJ\u2032 = S/(FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8})).\n\nObviously, FJ\u2032 \u222a J is an ideal of S and if x \u2208 FJ\u2032 and y \u2208 J, then \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is\nnilpotent, i.e. there is no edge in NS between x and y.\nNote however that for an arbitrary pseudo-nilpotent semigroup S with\nzero the set FJ\u2032 (S) is not necessarily an ideal for an ideal J of S. For\nexample let S = {\u03b8, a, b, c} be the semigroup with Cayley table\n\u03b8\na\nb\nc\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\na\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na\n\u03b8\n\nb\n\u03b8\na\nb\na\n\nc\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na\n\u03b8\n\nThen J = {\u03b8, a} ia an ideal of S, FJ (S) = {b} and FJ\u2032 (S) = {\u03b8, c}. Since\nbc = a, we have that FJ\u2032 (S) is not an ideal of S. Note furthermore that S is\ncommutative, thus it is (M N ) and hence pseudo-nilpotent.\nRecall that if B is a band, i.e. a semigroup of idempotents, then a semigroup S is said to be a B-band union of subsemigroups Sb , with b \u2208 B, provided that S = \u22c3b\u2208B Sb , a disjoint union and Sb1 Sb2 \u2286 Sb1 b2 for all b1 , b2 \u2208 B.\nLemma 3.2. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. Assume J is\nan ideal of S and J = M0 (G, I, \u039b; P ), a regular Rees matrix semigroup.\nAssume J is not nilpotent. The following properties hold.\n(1) FJ = {s \u2208 S/J \u2223 sj \u2260 \u03b8, js \u2260 \u03b8, j \u2032 sj \u2260 \u03b8 for all j, j \u2032 \u2208 J/{\u03b8}} and hence\nFJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}) is a subsemigroup of S and FJ\u2032 (S) is an ideal of S.\n(2) If a \u2208 FJ \u222a(J/{\u03b8}), then there exists a unique pair (e, f ) = (e(a), f (a))\n\u2208 I \u00d7 \u039b such that there is no edge in NS between a and (g; e, f ) for\nevery g \u2208 G, i.e. \u27e8(g; e, f ), a\u27e9 is nilpotent for all g \u2208 G and there\nis an edge in NS between a and each element in J/(Ge,f \u222a {\u03b8}) .\nFurthermore,\n\u03a6 \u2236 S \u00d0\u2192 (I \u00d7 \u039b)0\nwith\n\na\u21a6{\n\n(e(a), f (a)) if a \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8})\n\u03b8\notherwise\n\n\f9\n\nis a semigroup epimorphism from S to the rectangular band (I \u00d7\n\u039b)0 . We call \u03a6 a pseudo-nilpotent homomorphism. Also we have\na(J/{\u03b8}) \u2286 Ge(a),\u2217 and (J/{\u03b8})a \u2286 G\u2217,f (a) for a \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}).\n(3) S is the \u03a6(S)-band union of the semigroups \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(a)) with a \u2208 S,\nthat is S = \u22c3a\u2208S \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(a)) and \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(a)) \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(b)) \u2286 \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(ab)).\nThe sets \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(a)) will be called the pseudo-nilpotent classes of S.\n(4) If a, b \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}) and \u03a6(a) \u2260 \u03a6(b), then there is an edge in NS\nbetween a and b.\n(5) (S/FJ )/J is an ideal of S/J and J is an ideal of FJ \u222a J.\nProof. (1) Because J is pseudo-nilpotent, Lemma 3.1 yields that all entries\nof P are non-zero. Assume a \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}). Then there exists (g; i, \u03bb) \u2208 J\nsuch that a(g; i, \u03bb) \u2260 \u03b8 or (g; i, \u03bb)a \u2260 \u03b8. Since all entries of P are non-zero,\nwe get that aj, ja, jaj \u2032 are non-zero for all j, j \u2032 \u2208 J/{\u03b8}. Then\nFJ = {s \u2208 S/J \u2223 sj \u2260 \u03b8, js \u2260 \u03b8, j \u2032 sj \u2260 \u03b8 for all j, j \u2032 \u2208 J/{\u03b8}}.\n\nHence FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}) is a subsemigroup of S.\nNow let a \u2208 FJ\u2032 (S). Suppose that there exist b \u2208 S such that ab \u2208/ FJ\u2032 (S).\nThus ab \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}). Since FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}) is a subsemigroup of S and\nJ/{\u03b8} \u2260 \u2205, there exists j \u2208 J/{\u03b8} such that abj \u2260 \u03b8. Therefore, a \u2208 FJ \u222a\n(J/{\u03b8}) and we get a contradiction. Hence FJ\u2032 (S) is a right ideal of S.\nSimilarly we can prove that FJ\u2032 (S) is a left ideal. Thus FJ\u2032 (S) is an ideal of\nS.\n(2) Let a \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}). The group G is isomorphic with a subsemigroup\nof S. Hence G is pseudo-nilpotent too. Hence, by Lemma 2.5, G is nilpotent.\nBecause, by assumption J is not nilpotent and G is nilpotent, we have \u2223I\u2223 > 1\nor \u2223\u039b\u2223 > 1. We suppose that \u2223I\u2223 > 1.\nLet (g; i, j) \u2208 J with g \u2208 G. Since J is an ideal of S, then there exist i\u2032 , i\u2032\u2032 \u2208\nI, \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032\u2032 \u2208 \u039b such that a(g; i, \u03bb) = (g\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb), a2 (g; i, \u03bb) = (g\u2032\u2032 ; i\u2032\u2032 , \u03bb), (g; i, \u03bb)a =\n(k; i, \u03bb\u2032 ) and (g; i, \u03bb)a2 = (k\u2032 ; i, \u03bb\u2032\u2032 ) for some g\u2032 , g\u2032\u2032 , k, k\u2032 \u2208 G.

Then there exist w, z, r \u2032 , r \u2032\u2032 \u2208 G such that\na(r; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) = a(g\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb)(r \u2032 ; i, \u03bb\u2032 ) = aa(g; i, \u03bb)(r \u2032 ; i, \u03bb\u2032 ) =\n(g\u2032\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb)(r \u2032 ; i, \u03bb\u2032 ) = (w; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ),\n\n(r; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 )a = (r \u2032\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb)(k; i, \u03bb\u2032 )a = (r \u2032\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb)(g; i, \u03bb)aa =\n\n(r \u2032\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb)(k\u2032 ; i, \u03bb\u2032 ) = (z; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ).\nHence Gi\u2032 ,\u03bb\u2032 is an ideal of the semigroup \u27e8a\u27e9 \u222a Gi\u2032 ,\u03bb\u2032 . Since G \u2245 Gi\u2032 ,\u03bb\u2032 is\nnilpotent, Lemma 2.7 yields that there is no edge in NS between a and any\nelement of Gi\u2032 ,\u03bb\u2032 .\nNow let (s; \u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 J, (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2260 (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ). We have, for every 1 \u2264 n,\n(\u03bb2n (a, (s; \u03b1, \u03b2), (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1), \u03c12n (a, (s; \u03b1, \u03b2), (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1)) =\n\u2032\n; \u03b1, \u03b2)),\n((v2n ; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), (v2n\n\n(\u03bb2n\u22121 (a, (s; \u03b1, \u03b2), (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1), \u03c12n\u22121 (a, (s; \u03b1, \u03b2), (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1)) =\n\n\u2032\n((v2n\u22121 ; i\u2032 , \u03b2), (v2n\u22121\n; \u03b1, \u03bb\u2032 )),\nfor some vi , vi\u2032 \u2208 G. Because (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2260 (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), we thus have that\n\n\u03bbn\u2032 (a, (s; \u03b1, \u03b2), (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1) \u2260 \u03c1n\u2032 (a, (s; \u03b1, \u03b2), (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1),\n\nfor every n\u2032 \u2265 1. In a similar way as above for a and a2 , there is an edge in\nNS between (s; \u03b1, \u03b2) and a for every s \u2208 G. Therefore, between a and all\nelements of J/(Gi\u2032 ,\u03bb\u2032 \u222a {\u03b8}) there are edges in NS and (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) is the unique\nelement of I \u00d7 \u039b such that there is no edge in NS between a and all elements\nof Gi\u2032 ,\u03bb\u2032 .\nSo we have shown that if a \u2208 FJ and a(g; i, \u03bb) = (g\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb), (g; i, \u03bb)a =\n\u2032\n(k ; i, \u03bb\u2032 ) then \u27e8a, (g; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 )\u27e9 is nilpotent for any g \u2208 G and \u27e8a, (g; \u03b1, \u03b2)\u27e9 is\nnot nilpotent for any g \u2208 G and (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2260 (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ). Since \u03b8 \u2260 a(J/{\u03b8}) and\n\u03b8 \u2260 (J/{\u03b8})a, it follows that a(J/{\u03b8}) \u2286 Gi\u2032 ,\u2217 and (J/{\u03b8})a \u2286 G\u2217,\u03bb\u2032 . This\nfact will be used twice in the proof.\nNote that if (i, \u03bb) \u2260 (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) then it is readily verified that \u27e8(g; i, \u03bb), (g\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 )\u27e9\nis not nilpotent. So there is an edge in NS between (g; i, \u03bb) and (g\u2032 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ).\nOn the other hand, each \u27e8(g; i, \u03bb), (g\u2032 ; i, \u03bb)\u27e9 is nilpotent (as a subsemigroup\nof Gi,\u03bb \u2245 G).\nBecause of the above, we now can define a function\n\u03a6 \u2236 S \u2192 (I \u00d7 \u039b)0\n\nas follows. For a \u2208 S/FJ\u2032 , \u03a6(a) = (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) where (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) \u2208 I \u00d7 \u039b is such that\na(J/{\u03b8}) \u2286 Gi\u2032 ,\u2217 and (J/{\u03b8})a \u2286 G\u2217,\u03bb\u2032 . If a \u2208 FJ\u2032 then we define \u03a6(a) = \u03b8.\nConsider I \u00d7 \u039b as a rectangular band (for the natural multiplication).\nHence (I \u00d7 \u039b)0 is a band with a zero \u03b8.\nWe claim that \u03a6 is a semigroup homomorphism.\nSo let x, y \u2208 S. If x \u2208 FJ\u2032 or y \u2208 FJ\u2032 , then xy \u2208 FJ\u2032 (as by part (1), FJ\u2032 is an\nideal of S); hence \u03a6(xy) = \u03a6(x)\u03a6(y) = \u03b8.\n\n\f11\n\nAssume now that x, y \u2208 S/FJ\u2032 . Then there exist unique (i1 , \u03bb1 ), (i2 , \u03bb2 ) \u2208\nI \u00d7 \u039b, such that x(J/{\u03b8}) \u2286 Gi1 ,\u2217 , (J/{\u03b8})x \u2286 G\u2217,\u03bb1 , y(J/{\u03b8}) \u2286 Gi2 ,\u2217 and\n(J/{\u03b8})y \u2286 G\u2217,\u03bb2 . Consequently, xy(J/{\u03b8}) \u2286 xGi2 ,\u2217 \u2286 Gi1 ,\u2217 and (J/{\u03b8})xy \u2286\nG\u2217,\u03bb1 y \u2286 G\u2217,\u03bb2 . Hence, by the fact mentioned above, \u03a6(xy) = (i1 , \u03bb2 ) =\n(i1 , \u03bb1 )(i2 , \u03bb2 ) = \u03a6(x)\u03a6(y). So, indeed, \u03a6 is a semigroup homomorphism.\n(3) Because each element of (I\u00d7\u039b)0 is idempotent, one has that \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(a))\nis a subsemigroup of S for each a \u2208 S. As \u03a6 is surjective, we get that\nS = \u22c3x\u2208\u03a6(S) \u03a6\u22121 (x), a disjoint union and \u03a6\u22121 (x)\u03a6\u22121 (y) \u2286 \u03a6\u22121 (xy). Hence\nstatement (3) follows.\n(4) Assume a, b \u2208 FJ \u222a (J/{\u03b8}) are such that (i, \u03bb) = \u03a6(a) \u2260 \u03a6(b) = (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ).\nWe have, for every 1 \u2264 n,\n(\u03bb2n (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1), \u03c12n (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1))\n\n= ((m2n ; i, \u03bb), (m\u20322n ; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ),\n(\u03bb2n\u22121 (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1), \u03c12n\u22121 (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1)) =\n((m2n\u22121 ; i, \u03bb\u2032 ), (m\u20322n\u22121 ; i\u2032 , \u03bb)),\nfor some mk , m\u2032k \u2208 G. Because (i, \u03bb) \u2260 (i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ),\n\u03bbn\u2032 (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1) \u2260 \u03c1n\u2032 (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1),\n\nfor every n\u2032 \u2265 1. Since S is finite, there exist distinct positive integers t and\nr such that\n(\u03bbt (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1), \u03c1t (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1)) =\n\n(\u03bbr (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1), \u03c1r (a, b, (1; i\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ), 1, . . . , 1)).\nAs S is pseudo-nilpotent, we obtain that there is an edge in NS between a\nand b.\n(5) By part (1), FJ\u2032 is an ideal of S. Now since J is an ideal of S, statement\n(5) is obvious.\n\u0003\nEvery finite semigroup S has principal series:\n\nS = S1 \u2283 S2 \u2283 \u22ef \u2283 Sm \u2283 Sm+1 = \u2205.\n\nThat is, each Si is an ideal of S and there is no ideal of S strictly between Si\nand Si+1 (for convenience we call the empty set an ideal of S). Each principal\nfactor Si /Si+1 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) of S either is completely 0-simple, completely\nsimple or null. Every completely 0-simple factor semigroup is isomorphic\nwith a regular Rees matrix semigroup over a finite group G.\nSuppose S is pseudo-nilpotent. Then, by Lemma 3.1, every principal\nfactor which is a regular Rees matrix semigroup is nilpotent or all entries of\nthe respective sandwich matrix are non-zero, that is, it is a union of groups.\nIf Sm and all Si /Si+1 are nilpotent, then by Lemma 2.3, S is nilpotent as\nwell.\nDefinition 3.3. If Si /Si+1 is not nilpotent (thus Si /Si+1 is a semigroup)\nand there is no edge in NS between any element of Si /Si+1 and any element\nof Si+1 then we say that Si /Si+1 is a root of S.\n\n\f12\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nIn case Si /Si+1 is a root of S, then it follows from Lemma 3.2.(2) that if\ni\u2032 > i and Si /Si+1 \u2286 FSi\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1 (S/Si\u2032 +1 ) then Si\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1 is nilpotent.\nNote that there exist pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroups with more than\none root. An example is the semigroup T = {a, b, c, d, e} with multiplication\ntable\na b c d e\na a a a a a\nb a b a a b\nc a a c d a\nd a a c d a\ne a e a a e\nThe subsemigroups {b, e} and {c, d} are roots of T .\nIt is now convenient to identify the non-zero elements of S/I with those of\nS/I for I an ideal of S. Let j < i \u2264 m and let B = FS\u2032 i /Si+1 (S/Si+1 )\u2229(Sj /Sj+1 ).\nWe claim that B \u222a Sj+1 is an ideal of S.\nIndeed, let x \u2208 B \u222a Sj+1 and let a \u2208 S. We need to show that ax \u2208 B \u222a Sj+1\nand xa \u2208 B \u222a Sj+1 . We only prove the former, the other one is shown similar.\nWe give a proof by contradiction. So suppose ax \u2208/ B \u222a Sj+1 . Since x \u2208 Sj\nand Sj is an ideal of S, we have ax \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 . Furthermore, ax /\u2208 B and\nax /\u2208 Si /Si+1 imply ax \u2208 FSi /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ) and thus there exists an element y\nin Si /Si+1 such that axy \u2208/ Si+1 or yax \u2208/ Si+1 . Clearly ya \u2208 Si . Now since x\nin B, x \u2208 FS\u2032 i /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ) and thus xy and yax are in Si+1 . However, this\nis in contradiction with axy \u2208/ Si+1 or yax \u2208/ Si+1 . This proves that indeed\nax \u2208 B \u222a Sj+1 .\nNow, since Sj+1 \u2286 B \u222a Sj+1 \u2286 Sj and because there is no ideal strictly\nbetween Sj+1 and Sj , we get B = \u2205 or B = Sj /Sj+1 . It therefore follows that\nif B \u2260 \u2205 then Sj /Sj+1 \u2286 FS\u2032 i /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ). On the other hand if B = \u2205 then\nSj /Sj+1 \u2286 FSi /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ).\nFor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m let\nand\n\ni\u2217 = {j \u2264 i \u2223 Sj /Sj+1 \u2286 FSi /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ) \u222a Si /Si+1 }\nS (i) = \u22c3 (Sj /Sj+1 ).\nj\u2208i\u22c6\n\nSince FSi /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ) \u2286 S/Si , S/Si = \u22c31\u2264k<i (Sk /Sk+1 ) and the fact mentioned above we have\nS (i) = FSi /Si+1 (S/Si+1 ) \u222a Si /Si+1 .\n\nDefinition 3.4. If Si /Si+1 is a root then the set S (i) is called the stem of\nSi /Si+1 . In this case, because of Lemma 3.2, if Sj /Sj+1 \u2286 S (i) then there is\na path in NS between any two elements s, t \u2208 S (i) .\n\nNote that for every set T = Si /Si+1 we have three possible cases: (i) T\nis a root, (ii) T is not a root and there exists a non-nilpotent semigroup\nSj /Sj+1 such that T \u2286 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ) (so in this case there is an edge in\n\n\f13\n\nNS between some element of T and some element of Sj /Sj+1 ), (iii) T is not\na root and if T \u2286 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ) then Sj /Sj+1 is nilpotent. The third case\nwill be given a special name.\nDefinition 3.5. We say that Si /Si+1 is an isolated subset provided that\nSi /Si+1 is not a root that satisfies the property that if Si /Si+1 \u2286 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 )\nthen Sj /Sj+1 is nilpotent.\nDefinition 3.6. Suppose S (i1 ) and S (i2 ) are two distinct stems of S. If\nS (i1 ) \u2229 S (i2 ) \u2260 \u2205 then Sj /Sj+1 \u2286 S (i1 ) \u2229 S (i2 ) for some j. We call Sj /Sj+1 a\nconnection between the stems S (i1 ) and S (i2 ) .\nThe reason for this name is clear as in the upper non-nilpotent graph\nNS there is a path from any element of S (i1 ) to any element of S (i2 ) via a\nvertex in Sj /Sj+1 . For example, in the semigroup T = {\u03b8, a, b, c, d, f } with\nmultiplication table\n\u03b8 a b c d f\n\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8\na \u03b8 a b \u03b8 \u03b8 b\nb \u03b8 a b \u03b8 \u03b8 b\nc \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 c d d\nd \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 c d d\nf \u03b8 a b c d f\nWe prove that T is pseudo-nilpotent by contradiction. So, suppose the\ncontrary. Hence, there exist distinct elements x, y \u2208 T , elements w1 , . . . , wm \u2208\nT 1 , an ideal I of \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9 such that\n\u03bbt (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wt ) = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ),\n\u03c1t (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wt ) = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ),\n\n\u03bbm \u2260 \u03c1m , \u03bbm , \u03c1m \u2208/ I and \u27e8\u03bbi , \u03c1i \u27e9 is nilpotent in \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9/I for\nsome 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m. Because the subsemigroups {\u03b8, a, b} and {\u03b8, c, d} are ideals\nof S and {\u03b8, a, b}{\u03b8, c, d} = {\u03b8, c, d}{\u03b8, a, b} = {\u03b8}, the equalities imply that\nneither \u03bbi \u2208 {\u03b8, a, b}, \u03c1i \u2208 {\u03b8, c, d} nor \u03bbi \u2208 {\u03b8, c, d}, \u03c1i \u2208 {\u03b8, a, b}. Since \u27e8\u03bbi , \u03c1i \u27e9\nis nilpotent in \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9/I, either {\u03bbi , \u03c1i } = {b, f } or {\u03bbi , \u03c1i } = {d, f }.\nSuppose that {\u03bbi , \u03c1i } = {b, f }. Since \u03b8 \u2208/ {\u03bbi+1 , \u03c1i+1 }, wi+1 \u2208 {a, b, f, 1}. Then\n\u03bbi+1 = \u03c1i+1 = b, a contradiction. Similarly one obtains a contradiction for\n{\u03bbi , \u03c1i } = {d, f }. So, indeed, T is pseudo-nilpotent.\nNote that the set {f } is a connection between the stems {a, b, f } and\n{c, d, f }.\nLet S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup with principal series\nS = S1 \u2283 S2 \u2283 . . . \u2283 Sm \u2283 Sm+1 = \u2205.\n\nIf Si /Si+1 is not nilpotent then (Si /Si+1 )0 = M0 (G, I, \u039b; P ) (with all entries\nof P non-zero) and we denote by \u03a6i \u2236 (S/Si+1 )0 \u2192 (I \u00d7 \u039b)0 the pseudonilpotent homomorphism obtained in Lemma 3.2.\n\n\f14\n\nE.

(1) First suppose that S does not have any isolated subset. Then for\nevery principal factor Si /Si+1 , the subset Si /Si+1 is a root or there exists nonnilpotent semigroup Sj /Sj+1 such that Si /Si+1 \u2286 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ). Because\nof Lemma 3.2.(2), in both cases, all elements of Si /Si+1 are non-isolated\nvertices in NS . Therefore NS has no isolated vertex. Now suppose that I is\na nilpotent ideal of S. Then NI is empty and by Lemma 2.7 the elements\nof I are isolated vertices in NS . Hence, by the above, I is empty.\nNow assume S has an isolated subset, i.e. we suppose that K \u2260 \u2205. Suppose that a \u2208 K, b \u2208 S and ab \u2209 K. Let i and j be such that a \u2208 Si /Si+1 and\nab \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 . Because each Sk is an ideal of S, it is clear that i < j. Since\nab \u2209 K we have that Sj /Sj+1 is not an isolated subset. So either (i) Sj /Sj+1\nis a root, or (ii) Sj /Sj+1 is not a root and Sj /Sj+1 \u2286 FSk /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ) for\nsome k with j < k and Sk /Sk+1 is not nilpotent.\nWe first show that case (i) leads to a contradiction. So assume Sj /Sj+1 is\na root. In particular, Sj /Sj+1 is not nilpotent and \u2223Sj /Sj+1 \u2223 > 1. Thus there\nexists x \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 such that x \u2260 ab. Because a \u2208 Si /Si+1 and since Si /Si+1\nis an isolated subset we get that a \u2208 FS\u2032 j /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ). Hence xa \u2208 Sj+1\nand thus also xab \u2208 Sj+1 . On the other hand, by Lemma 3.1, Sj /Sj+1 is\na semigroup. But then x, ab \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 implies that xab \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 . This\ncontradicts with xab \u2208 Sj+1 and Sj /Sj+1 being a root.\nNext we show that case (ii) also leads to a contradiction. So suppose\nthat Sj /Sj+1 is not a root and that there exists a positive integer k such\nthat ab \u2208 FSk /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ), j < k and Sk /Sk+1 is not nilpotent. Choose\ny \u2208 Sk /Sk+1 . Since Si /Si+1 is an isolated subset and because a \u2208 Si /Si+1 we\nget that a \u2208 FS\u2032 k /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ). Hence, ya \u2208 Sk+1 . As Sk+1 is an ideal of S, we\n\n\f15\n\nthus obtain that yab \u2208 Sk+1 . So, by Lemma 3.2.(1), ab /\u2208 FSk /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ), a\ncontradiction.\nWe thus have shown that indeed K is a right ideal of S. Similarly one\nshows that it is a left ideal and thus it is an ideal.\nWe now prove that all elements of K are isolated vertices. So suppose\nthe contrary and let i be the largest positive integer such that Si /Si+1 \u2286\nK and Si /Si+1 contains a non-isolated vertex, say v. Then there exists\nan element w \u2208 S such that \u27e8v, w\u27e9 is not nilpotent. Lemma 2.1 implies\nthat there exists a positive integer m\u2032 , distinct elements x, y \u2208 \u27e8v, w\u27e9 and\nelements w1 , w2 , . . . , wm\u2032 \u2208 \u27e8v, w\u27e91 , such that x = \u03bbm\u2032 (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm\u2032 ),\ny = \u03c1m\u2032 (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm\u2032 ). As S is pseudo-nilpotent, we get that \u27e8x, y\u27e9\nis not nilpotent. Hence, since \u27e8w\u27e9 is nilpotent, we get that {x, y} \u2286/ \u27e8w\u27e9. As\nSi is an ideal of S and v \u2208 Si , we clearly have \u27e8w, v\u27e9/\u27e8w\u27e9 \u2286 Si . Therefore\n{x, y} \u2229 Si \u2260 \u2205. Again because Si is an ideal of S and since m\u2032 \u2265 1, the\nequalities\nx = \u03bbm\u2032 (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm\u2032 ), y = \u03c1m\u2032 (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm\u2032 ),\n\nimply that x, y \u2208 Si . Because K is an ideal we obtain in a similar manner\nthat x, y \u2286 K. By the maximality choice of i we have that x, y \u2208 Si /Si+1 .\nSince S is pseudo-nilpotent, the above equalities yield that there is an edge\nbetween x and y in NS/Si+1 . So, by Lemma 3.1, Si /Si+1 is a non-nilpotent\nsemigroup.\nSince Si /Si+1 is an isolated subset and Si /Si+1 is not nilpotent, it follows\nfrom the definition of root, that there exist i\u2032 > i, a \u2208 Si /Si+1 and b \u2208 Si\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1\nsuch that there is an edge in NS between a and b. Again with a similar\nproof as above, there exist elements a\u2032 , b\u2032 in \u27e8a, b\u27e9 \u2229 Si\u2032 such that \u27e8a\u2032 , b\u2032 \u27e9 is\nnot nilpotent and a\u2032 , b\u2032 \u2208 K. Let i\u2032\u2032 > i be such that a\u2032 \u2208 Si\u2032\u2032 /Si\u2032\u2032 +1 . As K\nis a union of isolated subsets, it follows that Si\u2032\u2032 /Si\u2032\u2032 +1 \u2286 K and Si\u2032\u2032 /Si\u2032\u2032 +1\ncontains a non-isolated vertex. This contradicts with the maximality of i.\nHence we have shown that indeed all elements of K are isolated vertices.\nWe now show that if Si /Si+1 is not an isolated subset then it does not\ncontain any isolated vertex; and hence K is indeed the set of all isolated\nvertices. So suppose Si /Si+1 is not an isolated subset. Then either it is a\nroot or Si /Si+1 \u2286 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ) for some j > i with Sj /Sj+1 not nilpotent.\nIn the former case, Lemma 3.1 yields that the upper non-nilpotent graph\nof Si /Si+1 is non-empty, connected and regular. Hence Si /Si+1 does not\nhave any isolated vertices in NS . In the second case, again by Lemma 3.1,\nthere exists a j > i such that Sj /Sj+1 = M(G, I, \u039b; P ), G a nilpotent group,\n\u2223I\u2223 + \u2223\u039b\u2223 \u2265 3, all entries of P are non-zero and Si /Si+1 \u2286 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ).\nAgain NSj /Sj+1 is a non-empty connected and regular graph. By Lemma 3.2,\nthere exists a pseudo-nilpotent homomorphism \u03a6 from (S/Sj+1 )0 to the\nrectangular band (I \u00d7 \u039b)0 . Furthermore, there is an edge in NS between\na \u2208 Si /Si+1 and any element in (Sj /Sj+1 )/G\u03a6(a) . Hence, Si /Si+1 does not\nhave any isolated vertices. So, indeed, K is the set of all isolated vertices.\n\n\f16\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nAs NK is empty and K is pseudo-nilpotent, by Lemma 2.4, the semigroup\nK is nilpotent. It remains to show that K is the largest nilpotent ideal\nof S. To do so, let a \u2208 K \u2032 /K with K \u2032 an ideal that is nilpotent. Then\nthere exists b \u2208 S with \u27e8a, b\u27e9 not nilpotent. Since S is pseudo-nilpotent\nand \u27e8a, b\u27e9 \u2286 \u27e8b\u27e9 \u222a K \u2032 , it follows with an argument as above that there exist\ne, f \u2208 K \u2032 with \u27e8e, f \u27e9 not nilpotent. However, this contradicts with K \u2032 being\nnilpotent. So, indeed K is the largest nilpotent ideal of S.\n(2) If i1 = i2 or i2 = i3 , then the statement is obvious. Assume i1 \u2260 i2 and\ni2 \u2260 i3 . Then the sets FSi2 /Si2 +1 (S/Si2 +1 )\u2229(Si1 /Si1 +1 ) and FSi3 /Si3 +1 (S/Si3 +1 )\n\u2229(Si2 /Si2 +1 ) are not empty. Hence we get that Si1 /Si1 +1 \u2286 FSi2 /Si2 +1 (S/Si2 +1 )\nand Si2 /Si2 +1 \u2286 FSi3 /Si3 +1 (S/Si3 +1 ). It follows that for a \u2208 Si1 /Si1 +1 there\nexists b \u2208 Si2 /Si2 +1 such that ab \u2208 Si2 /Si2 +1 or ba \u2208 Si2 /Si2 +1 . Suppose\nthat ab \u2208 Si2 /Si2 +1 . Then ab \u2208 FSi3 /Si3 +1 (S/Si3 +1 ) and thus there exist c \u2208\nSi3 /Si3 +1 such that abc \u2208 Si3 /Si3 +1 or cab \u2208 Si3 /Si3 +1 . If abc \u2208 Si3 /Si3 +1 , then\nbc \u2208 Si3 /Si3 +1 and thus a \u2208 FSi3 /Si3 +1 (S/Si3 +1 ). Also if cab \u2208 Si3 /Si3 +1 , then\nca \u2208 Si3 /Si3 +1 and thus a \u2208 FSi3 /Si3 +1 (S/Si3 +1 ). Similarly if ba \u2208 Si2 /Si2 +1 ,\nthen a \u2208 FSi3 /Si3 +1 (S/Si3 +1 ). Consequently Si1 /Si1 +1 \u2286 S (i3 ) .\nNow assume Si2 /Si2 +1 = M(G2 , I2 , \u039b2 ; P2 ) and Si3 /Si3 +1 = M(G3 , I3 , \u039b3 ;\nP3 ) are semigroups that are not nilpotent.

Because of Lemma 3.2.(2) there exist the pseudonilpotent homomorphisms \u03a62 \u2236 (S/Si2 +1 )0 \u2192 (I2 \u00d7\u039b2 )0 and \u03a63 \u2236 (S/Si3 +1 )0 \u2192\n(I3 \u00d7 \u039b3 )0 .\nFor every a \u2208 Si1 /Si1 +1 and g \u2208 G2 , k, l \u2208 G3 , by Lemma 3.2.(2), there exist\nelements k\u2032 , k\u2032\u2032 , l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 \u2208 G3 , g\u2032 , g\u2032\u2032 \u2208 G2 such that\n(k; \u03a63 ((g; \u03a62 (a))))\na(g; \u03a62 (a))\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(g ; \u03a62 (a))(k ; \u03a63 ((g\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a))))\n(l; \u03a63 ((g; \u03a62 (a))))\n(g; \u03a62 (a))a\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n(l ; \u03a63 ((g ; \u03a62 (a))))(g\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a))\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(g; \u03a62 (a))(k\u2032 ; \u03a63 ((g; \u03a62 (a)))),\n(g\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a)),\n(k\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a63 ((g \u2032 ; \u03a62 (a)))),\n(l\u2032 ; \u03a63 ((g; \u03a62 (a))))(g; \u03a62 (a)),\n(g\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a)),\n(l\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a63 ((g\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a)))).\n\nAs G2 is nilpotent, there is no edge in NS between (g; \u03a62 (a)), (g\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a)) and\n(g\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a)). Lemma 3.2.(4) implies that \u03a63 ((g; \u03a62 (a))) = \u03a63 ((g\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a))) =\n\u03a63 ((g\u2032\u2032 ; \u03a62 (a))).

Clearly Si /Si+1 \u2286 S (i ) .\nIf Si\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1 is a root, then the statement obviously holds. Otherwise, as\nSi\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1 is not nilpotent (and thus its vertices in NS are not isolated), we\nobtain from part (1) that Si\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1 is not an isolated subset. Hence there\nexists a positive integer j > i\u2032 such that Si\u2032 /Si\u2032 +1 \u2286 S (j) and Sj /Sj+1 is not\nnilpotent. By part (2), Si /Si+1 \u2286 S (j) . However, this contradicts with the\ncondition on i\u2032 .\n(4) Let s \u2208 S/K and let i be such that s \u2208 Si /Si+1 . In particular Si /Si+1\nis not an isolated subset. If Si /Si+1 is a root then s \u2208 S (i) . If Si /Si+1 is not\na root, then, by part (3), s \u2208 S (k) for some k > i and Sk /Sk+1 is a root. It\neasily can be verified that any element of a non-isolated subset is not an\nisolated vertex in NS . Hence the statement follows.\n(5) Suppose S (i) is a stem. As Si /Si+1 is a root, it is not nilpotent and by\nLemma 3.1, Si /Si+1 = M(G, I, \u039b; P ) a regular Rees matrix semigroup with\n\u2223I\u2223 + \u2223\u039b\u2223 > 2, G a nilpotent group and all entries of P non-zero and there\nexists a pseudo-nilpotent homomorphism \u03a6 \u2236 (S/Si+1 )0 \u2192 (I \u00d7 \u039b)0 . Now\nsuppose that a, b \u2208 S (i) . Hence \u03a6(a) and \u03a6(b) are non-zero in (I \u00d7 \u039b)0 and\nthus \u03a6(ab) = \u03a6(a) \u03a6(b) is also non-zero. So ab \u2208 S (i) .\n(6) Suppose a \u2208 Si /Si+1 , b \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 , ab \u2209 K and Si /Si+1 and Sj /Sj+1 are\nnot in a same stem. By part (4), there exists some k such that ab \u2208 S (k)\nand Sk /Sk+1 is a root. Hence ab \u2209 FS\u2032 k /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ). As by Lemma 3.2.(1)\nFS\u2032 k /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ) is an ideal of S/Sk+1 , it follows that a, b \u2209 FS\u2032 k /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ).\nHence, a, b \u2208 FSk /Sk+1 (S/Sk+1 ). But this contradicts with the assumption\nthat a and b do not belong to a same stem. This proves one implication of\n(6). The converse easily can be verified.\n\u0003\nWe now give several consequences of Theorem 3.7.\nLemma 2.5 as follows.\n\nFirst we extend\n\nCorollary 3.8. A finite monoid S is pseudo-nilpotent if and only if it is\nnilpotent.\nProof. Suppose S is a pseudo-nilpotent finite monoid. From Theorem 3.7 we\nknow that the set consisting of the isolated vertices is the largest nilpotent\nideal K of S. Clearly 1 \u2208 K. Hence, S = K is nilpotent. The result\nfollows.\n\u0003\nNote that in general (Si /Si+1 )(Sj /Sj+1 ) \u2288 K does not imply that if Si /Si+1\nis contained in a stem S (h) then Sj /Sj+1 \u2286 S (h) . However, we can prove the\nfollowing.\n\n\f18\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nCorollary 3.9. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup and a, b \u2208 S.\nIf there exists an edge in NS between a and b, then there exists a stem S (i)\nsuch that a, b \u2208 S (i) .\nProof. Since a and b are not isolated vertices, by Theorem 3.7.(1), both\na and b do not belong to K. Let Si /Si+1 and Sj /Sj+1 be principal factors of S such that a \u2208 Si /Si+1 and b \u2208 Sj /Sj+1 . If ab or ba is not in K,\nthen (Si /Si+1 )(Sj /Sj+1 ) \u2288 K or (Sj /Sj+1 )(Si /Si+1 ) \u2288 K and thus by Theorem 3.7.(6) the statement obviously holds.\nNow suppose that ab, ba \u2208 K. Since \u27e8a, b\u27e9 is not nilpotent, by Lemma 2.1,\nthere exists a positive integer m, distinct elements x, y \u2208 \u27e8a, b\u27e9 and w1 , w2 , . . . ,\nwm \u2208 \u27e8a, b\u27e91 such that x = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ), y = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . ,\nwm ). As S is pseudo-nilpotent and \u27e8a\u27e9 and \u27e8b\u27e9 are nilpotent, we get that\n{x, y} \u2288 \u27e8a\u27e9 and {x, y} \u2288 \u27e8b\u27e9. Since ab, ba \u2208 K and K is an ideal, it follows\nthat x, y \u2208 K. As K is nilpotent, Theorem 3.7.(1) then implies that \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is\nnilpotent, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.10. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. The following properties hold.\n(1) Every stem is connected and any two distinct elements of a stem are\nconnected by a path of length at most 2.\n(2) If K is empty, then S = S (i) for some root Si /Si+1 , NS is connected\nand every two distinct vertices are connected by a path of length at\nmost 2.\n(3) If S does not have any connections, then every connected component\nwith more than one element is a stem and it is a subsemigroup.\n(4) The union of two stems that have a connection is a connected subset\nof NS . Furthermore, every shortest path in this union has length at\nmost 4.\nProof. We use the same notation as in Theorem 3.7.\n(1) Assume Si /Si+1 is a root and suppose s, t \u2208 S (i) , with s \u2260 t. By\nLemma 3.1, Si /Si+1 = M(G, I, \u039b; P ), a regular Rees matrix semigroup, with\n\u2223I\u2223 + \u2223\u039b\u2223 > 2, G is a nilpotent group and all entries of P are non-zero. By\nLemma 3.2.(2), there exists a pseudo-nilpotent homomorphism\n\u03a6 \u2236 (S/Si+1 )0 \u2192 (I \u00d7 \u039b)0 .\n\nSince s, t \u2208 S (i) , we have \u03a6(s) \u2260 \u03b8, \u03a6(t) \u2260 \u03b8.\nIf \u03a6(s) \u2260 \u03a6(t), then by Lemma 3.2.(4), there is an edge in NS between s\nand t. If \u03a6(s) = \u03a6(t), there exists (c, d) \u2208 I \u00d7 \u039b such that (c, d) \u2260 \u03a6(s) and\ng \u2208 G such that there is an edge in NS between s and (g; c, d) and between\nt and (g; c, d). Hence a shortest path between s and t has length at most 2.\n(2) Assume K = \u2205. Then, by Theorem 3.7.(4), every element of S belongs\nto a stem. By Theorem 3.7.(6), we also get that S has only one stem. Part\n(1) thus yields that S is connected and a shortest path between any two\ndistinct elements s, t \u2208 S has length at most 2.\n\n\f19\n\n(3) Assume that S does not have any connections. Suppose S (i) is a\nstem, s \u2208 S (i) and t \u2209 S (i) and assume there is an edge in NS between s\nand t. Corollary 3.9 implies that there exists a stem S (k) such that s, t \u2208\nS (k) . Let p be such that s \u2208 Sp /Sp+1 and Sp /Sp+1 is a principal factor.\nThen Sp /Sp+1 is a connection between S (i) and S (k) . This contradicts with\nthe assumption that S does not have any connections. It follows that any\nconnected component with more than one element is contained in a stem.\nBecause of part (1) we actually get that such a connected component is a\nstem. Furthermore, by Theorem 3.7.(5), a stem is a subsemigroup.\n(4) Suppose Sk /Sk+1 is a connection between two stems S (i) and S (j) .\nLet s, t \u2208 S (i) \u222a S (j) and let x \u2208 Sk /Sk+1 . Since s and x belong to the same\nstem, by part (1) they are connected by a path of length at most 2. By the\nsame reson t and x are connected by a path of length at most 2. Therefore\nthe result follows.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.11. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. The following properties hold.\n(1) Every connected component of NS that has more than one element\nis a union of some stems.\n(2) If C is a connected component of S then C \u222a K is a semigroup.\n(3) If C1 , . . . , Cn are the connected components of S with more than one\nelement then S/K = C1\u03b8 \u222a \u22ef \u222a Cn\u03b8 , a 0-disjoint union.\nProof. This follows at once from Theorem 3.7 and Corollary 3.10.\n\n\u0003\n\nSo we have shown that every non-isolated connected component of a\npseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup S is a union of stems, say S1 , . . . , Sn .\nHence, every Si has a connection with Sj for some i \u2260 j. However, Si is\nnot necessarily connected with every Sj . We give an example.

We claim\nthat S is pseudo-nilpotent. We prove this by contradiction. So assume that\nthere exist distinct elements x, y \u2208 S, elements w1 , . . . , wm \u2208 S 1 , an ideal I\nof \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9 such that\n\u03bbt (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wt ) = \u03bbm (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ),\n\n\u03c1t (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wt ) = \u03c1m (x, y, w1 , w2 , . . . , wm ),\n\u03bbm \u2260 \u03c1m , \u03bbm , \u03c1m /\u2208 I and \u27e8\u03bbi , \u03c1i \u27e9 is nilpotent in \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9/I for some\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 m. Because the subsemigroups Yk = {\u03b8, ak , bk } are ideals of S for\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, if {\u03bbi , \u03c1i , wi+1 } \u2229 Yk \u2260 \u2205 for some 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, then {\u03bbi+1 , \u03c1i+1 } \u2286\nYk . Since \u03bbm \u2260 \u03c1m , {\u03bbi+1 , \u03c1i+1 } = {ak , bk } and thus ak , bk \u2208 S/I. Also\n\n\f21\n\nsince \u03bbi+1 , \u03c1i+1 \u2208 \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9, we have that ak , bk \u2208 \u27e8x, y, w1 , . . . , wm \u27e9.\nTherefore there is an edge between (ak , bk ) in N\u27e8x,y,w1 ,...,wm \u27e9/I .\nWe claim that ak \u2208/ S(S/{ak }). Indeed, suppose the contrary, i.e. assume\n\u03b1\u03b2 = ak with \u03b1 \u2208 S and \u03b2 \u2208 (S/{ak }). Then \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2 = ak \u03b2. Since S is\nband, ak = \u03b1\u03b2 = ak \u03b2. Now as ak (S/{ak }) = {\u03b8, bk } we get that \u03b2 = ak , a\ncontradiction. This proves the claim. Now as ak \u2208 {\u03bbi wi+1 \u03c1i , \u03c1i wi+1 \u03bbi } and\nak /\u2208 S(S/{ak }), ak \u2208 {\u03bbi , \u03c1i }. Suppose that \u03bbi = ak . Since there is no edge\nbetween \u03bbi and \u03c1i , \u03c1i \u2208 S/{ak , bk , fk , fk\u22121 , lk }, because if \u03c1i \u2208 {bk , fk\u22121 , fk , lk }\nthen there are edges between \u03bbi and \u03c1i in N\u27e8x,y,w1 ,...,wm \u27e9/I . Now as ak wk+1 \u2208\nYk and Yk (S/{ak , bk , fk , fk\u22121 , lk }) = {\u03b8}, \u03b8 \u2208 {\u03bbi+1 , \u03c1i+1 }, a contradiction.\nHence {\u03bbi , \u03c1i , wi+1 } \u2286 {f0 , \u22ef, fn , l1 , \u22ef, ln }.\nSince {f0 , \u22ef, fn , l1 , \u22ef, ln }lk = lk {f0 , \u22ef, fn , l1 , \u22ef, ln } = {\u03b8, lk } for every 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 n, {\u03bbi , \u03c1i , wi+1 } \u2286 {f0 , \u22ef, fn }. Also {f0 , \u22ef, fk\u22121 , fk+1 , \u22ef, fn }fk = fk {f0 , \u22ef,\nfk\u22121 , fk+1 , \u22ef, fn } = {\u03b8, lk } for every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Thus {\u03bbi+1 , \u03c1i+1 } = {\u03b8, lk }.\nThen S is pseudo-nilpotent.\nAs S is a band, we have that NS = MS . The graph NS is depicted in\nFigure 1. Between b0 and dn the shortest path has a length 4 + 2n. Between\nthe roots {ai , bi } and {ai+1 , bi+1 }, there is a connection, but there is no\nconnection between the roots {ai , bi } and {ai+2 , bi+2 }.\nWe introduce a class of pseudo-nilpotent semigroups for which the connectivity between the stems is transitive.\n\nDefinition 3.12. A pseudo-nilpotent semigroup S is said to be strong pseudonilpotent if it satisfies the following properties.\n(H1) If NS has a connection Si /Si+1 between two stems S (i1 ) and S (i2 ) ,\nthen the pseudo-nilpotent homomorphisms \u03a61 and \u03a62 with domains\n(S/Si1 +1 )0 and (S/Si2 +1 )0 respectively are such that Si /Si+1 intersects two different pseudo-nilpotent classes of \u03a61 and it also intersects two different pseudo-nilpotent classes of \u03a62 .\n(H2) If Si /Si+1 and Sj /Sj+1 are principal factors of S with i < j and there\nis an edge in NS between some of their elements , then Si /Si+1 \u2282\nFSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ).\n\nNote that property (H1) implies that each connection intersects nontrivially the different pseudo-nilpotent classes of the pseudo-nilpotent homomorphism determined by the stem in which it is contained. Hence,\nLemma 3.2.(4) easily yields that if Si /Si+1 and Sj /Sj+1 are different connections that are in a same stem, then there exists (s, t) \u2208 NS with s \u2208 Si /Si+1 , t \u2208\nSj /Sj+1 . Also if i < j, property (H2) implies Si /Si+1 \u2282 FSj /Sj+1 (S/Sj+1 ).\n\n\f22\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\nAn example of a strong pseudo-nilpotent semigroup is the semigroup R =\n{\u03b8, a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , b1 , b2 , b3 } with multiplication table\n\u03b8\na1\na2\na3\na4\nb1\nb2\nb3\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\na1\n\u03b8\na1\na1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na1\na1\na1\n\na2\n\u03b8\na2\na2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na2\na2\na2\n\na3\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na3\na3\na3\na3\na3\n\na4\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na4\na4\na4\na4\na4\n\nb1\n\u03b8\na1\na1\na3\na3\nb1\nb1\nb1\n\nb2\n\u03b8\na2\na2\na3\na3\nb2\nb2\nb2\n\nb3\n\u03b8\na2\na2\na4\na4\nb3\nb3\nb3\n\nWith a similar proof to the one given for the example stated before Definition 3.12 one shows that R is pseudo-nilpotent. Furthermore, R has\ntwo roots {a1 , a2 }, {a3 , a4 }, with respective stems say R1 and R2 . The set\n{b1 , b2 , b3 } is a connection between R1 and R2 . The sets {b1 } and {b2 , b3 }\nbelong to different pseudo-nilpotent classes determined by the root {a1 , a2 }\nand the sets {b1 , b2 } and {b3 } belong to different pseudo-nilpotent classes\ndetermined by the root {a3 , a4 }. Therefore R is a strong pseudo-nilpotent\nsemigroup.\nLemma 3.13. Let S be a strong pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. The\nfollowing properties hold.\n(1) If there is a connection between the stems S (i1 ) and S (i2 ) and also\nbetween the stems S (i2 ) and S (i3 ) , then there is a connection between\nthe stems S (i1 ) and S (i3 ) .\n(2) If there is no connection between two stems S (i) and S (j) then these\nstems belong to different connected components of NS .\n\nProof. (1) Suppose Sk1 /Sk1 +1 is a connection between the stems S (i1 ) and\nS (i2 ) and Sk2 /Sk2 +1 is a connection between the stems S (i2 ) and S (i3 ) .\nSuppose that k1 < k2 . Since S is a strong pseudo-nilpotent semigroup,\nSk1 /Sk1 +1 \u2286 FSk /Sk +1 (S/Sk2 +1 ) and thus Sk1 /Sk1 +1 \u2286 S (k2 ) . Since Sk2 /Sk2 +1\n\n\u2286 S (i3 ) , we obtain from Theorem 3.7.(2) that Sk1 /Sk1 +1 \u2286 S (i3 ) . Therefore\nSk1 /Sk1 +1 is a connection between the stems S (i1 ) and S (i3 ) .\n(2) Let S (i) and S (j) be two different stems. Suppose that x \u2208 S (i) ,\ny \u2208 S (j) and that x = z0 , z1 , . . . , zn , zn+1 = y is a path between x and y.\nBecause of Theorem 3.7.(4), for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, we get that there exist stems\nS (nzi ) and subsets Smzi /Smzi +1 of S (nzi ) such that zi \u2208 Smzi /Smzi +1 for a\nprincipal factor Smzi /Smzi +1 .\nSuppose that mzi < mzi+1 . Since S is a strong pseudo-nilpotent semigroup\nand there is an edge in NS between zi and zi+1 , we have Smzi /Smzi +1 \u2286\nFSmz /Smz +1 (S/Smzi+1 +1 ). Hence Smzi /Smzi +1 is a connection between\n2\n\n2\n\nthe stems S (nzi ) and S (nzi +1) . Similarly we have this result for mzi > mzi+1 .\ni+1\n\ni+1\n\n\f23\n\nTherefore by part (1), there is a connection between S (i) and S (j) . This\ncontradicts with there is no connection between them.\n\u0003\nNote that if S is a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup that is not strong\npseudo-nilpotent then in general Lemma 3.13 does not hold. For example,\nthe pseudo-nilpotent semigroup with graph as depicted in Figure 1, does\nnot satisfy property (H1) and it satisies neither (1) nor (2) of Lemma 3.13.\nAn example of a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup that does not satisfy\nproperty (H2) and it satisfies neither (1) nor (2) of Lemma 3.13, is the\nsemigroup T = {\u03b8, a1 , a2 , a3 , b1 , b2 , b3 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 } with multiplication table\n\u03b8\na1\nb1\na2\nb2\na3\nb3\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\na1\n\u03b8\na1\na1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na1\na1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\nb1\n\u03b8\nb1\nb1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nb1\nb1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\na2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na2\na2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na2\na2\na2\na2\n\nb2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nb2\nb2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nb2\nb2\nb2\nb2\n\na3\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na3\na3\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na3\na3\n\nb3\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nb3\nb3\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nb3\nb3\n\nf1\n\u03b8\nb1\nb1\nb2\nb2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nf1\nf1\nb2\nb2\n\nf2\n\u03b8\na1\na1\na2\na2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nf2\nf2\na2\na2\n\nf3\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nb2\nb2\nb3\nb3\nb2\nb2\nf3\nf3\n\nf4\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\na2\na2\na3\na3\na2\na2\nf4\nf4\n\nWe leave it to the reader to verify that T is pseudo-nilpotent. Further,\nthe semigroup T has three roots {a1 , b1 }, {a2 , b2 }, {a3 , b3 }, with respective\nstems say T1 , T2 and T3 . The set {f1 , f2 } is a connection between T1 and\nT2 and the set {f3 , f4 } is a connection between T2 and T3 , but there is no\nconnection between T1 and T3 .

Let S be a strong pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup with\nK the ideal of isolated vertices. Two elements x and y of S/K are in the\nsame connected component of NS if and only if there exists an element z \u2208 S\nsuch that xz \u2208/ K and zy \u2208/ K.\nProof. Suppose x and y are in S/K. Assume x and y are in a same stem, say\nS (h) . Because of Theorem 3.7.(5), S (h) is a subsemigroup of S and because of\nCorollary 3.10.(1), S (h) is connected. Hence, by Theorem 3.7.(5), xy, y 2 \u2209 K\nand x and y are in the same connected component.\nNow assume that x and y are not in a same stem. Because of Theorem 3.7.(4), there exist stems S (i) , S (j) such that x \u2208 S (i) and y \u2208 S (j) . We\nneed to deal with two cases: (i) between S (i) and S (j) , there is a connection,\nsay Sk /Sk+1 , (ii) between S (i) and S (j) there is no connection.\n\n\f24\n\nE. JESPERS AND M.H. SHAHZAMANIAN\n\n(i) Let z \u2208 Sk /Sk+1 \u2286 S (i) \u2229S (j) . Since S (i) and S (j) are semigroups we get\nthat xz \u2208 S (i) and zy \u2208 S (j) and thus xz /\u2208 K and zy \u2208/ K. Corollary 3.10.(4)\nimplies that x and y are in the same connected component.\n(ii) Since, by assumption, there is no connection between S (i) and S (j) ,\nLemma 3.13.(2) yields that x and y are in different connected components.\nNow let z \u2208 S and assume xz, zy \u2208/ K. Then, by Theorem 3.7.(6), there\nexists stems S (k1 ) and S (k2 ) such that x, z \u2208 S (k1 ) and z, y \u2208 S (k2 ) . Corollary 3.10.(4) implies that x and y are in the same connected component, a\ncontradiction.\nThe result follows.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.15. Let S be a pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup and let K be\nits largest nilpotent ideal. For a \u2208 S put Ka = {s \u2208 S \u2223 as \u2208/ K}. Because of\nTheorem 3.7.(6), Ka = {s \u2208 S \u2223 sa /\u2208 K}.\nCorollary 3.16. Let S be a strong pseudo-nilpotent finite semigroup. The\nconnected components with more than one element are the maximal elements\nin the set {Ka \u2223 a \u2208 S/K}.\n\nProof. By Theorem 3.7, if a connected component of a \u2208 S has more than\none element then a \u2208 S/K. Furthermore, a \u2208 Ka for any a \u2208 S/K. Let\nx \u2208 S/K be such that Kx is a maximal element in the set {Ka \u2223 a \u2208 S/K}.\nWe need to prove that Kx is a connected component.\nFirst we notice that Kx is connected. Indeed, if y \u2208 Kx , then xy \u2209 K.\nHence, again by Theorem 3.7, x and y are in a same stem. Since every stem\nis connected by Corollary 3.10, there is a path between x and y. Hence all\nthe element of Kx are in the same connected component.\nSecond, suppose that z \u2208 S is in the connected component containing x.\nIt remains to be shown that z \u2208 Kx . To do so, we first notice from Corollary 3.14 that there exists v \u2208 S such that xv \u2208/ K and vz \u2208/ K. Because\nof Theorem 3.7.(6), there exist stems S (i1 ) and S (i2 ) such that x, v \u2208 S (i1 ) ,\nz, v \u2208 S (i2 ) . Assume x \u2208 Snx /Snx +1 , z \u2208 Snz /Snz +1 and v \u2208 Snv /Snv +1 , where\nT1 = Snx /Snx +1 , T2 = Snz /Snz +1 and T3 = Snv /Snv +1 are principal factors\nof S. As S is strong pseudo-nilpotent and T3 is a connection between the\nstems S (i1 ) and S (i2 ) , T3 intersects non-trivially different pseudo-nilpotent\nclasses of the pseudo-nilpotent homomorphisms determined by these stems.\nHence by Lemma 3.2.(4), there is an edge between some non-zero elements\nof T1 and T3 and there also is an edge between some non-zero elements\nof T2 and T3 in NS . Consequently, either (T1 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT3 (S/Snv +1 ) or\n(T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT1 (S/Snx +1 ), and either (T2 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT3 (S/Snv +1 ) or (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286\nFT2 (S/Snz +1 ). We therefore need to deal with four cases.\n(Case 1) (T1 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT3 (S/Snv +1 ) and (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT2 (S/Snz +1 ).\nBy Theorem 3.7.(2), we get that (T1 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT2 (S/Snz +1 ). Hence, (T1 /{\u03b8})\n(T2 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 S (i2 ) . So, by Theorem 3.7.(6), T1 /{\u03b8} and T2 /{\u03b8} are in a same\nstem. Consequently, by Theorem 3.7.(5), xz \u2208/ K and thus z \u2208 Kx .\n\n\f25\n\n(Case 2) (T1 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT3 (S/Snv +1 ) and (T2 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT3 (S/Snv +1 ).\nIn this case, by Theorem 3.7.(2), x, z \u2208 (T1 /{\u03b8}) \u222a (T2 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 S (i2 ) . Hence,\nby Theorem 3.7.(5), xz /\u2208 K. So again z \u2208 Kx .\n(Case 3) (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT1 (S/Snx +1 ) and (T2 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT3 (S/Snv +1 ).\nAs in (Case 1) one obtains that z \u2208 Kx .\n(Case 4) (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT1 (S/Snx +1 ) and (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT2 (S/Snz +1 ).\nClearly x, z \u2208 Kv . Assume y \u2208 Kx (and thus, in particular, y /\u2208 K) and\ny \u2208 Sny /Sny +1 for some principal factor T4 = Sny /Sny +1 .\nWe claim that y \u2208 Kv . Let S (i3 ) be a stem such that x, y \u2208 S (i3 ) . If\n(i3 )\nS\n= S (i1 ) , then by Theorem 3.7.(5), yv /\u2208 K and thus y \u2208 Kv . Suppose\nthat S (i3 ) \u2260 S (i1 ) . Then T1 is a connection between S (i1 ) and S (i3 ) . Since S\nis strong pseudo-nilpotent, we know that either (T4 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT1 (S/Snx +1 ) or\n(T1 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT4 (S/Sny +1 ). If (T4 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT1 (S/Snx +1 ) then since (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286\nFT1 (S/Snx +1 ), as in Case 2 we obtain that vy \u2208/ K and thus y \u2208 Kv . If\n(T1 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT4 (S/Sny +1 ) then, since (T3 /{\u03b8}) \u2286 FT1 (S/Snx +1 ), as in Case 1\nwe obtain that vy /\u2208 K and thus y \u2208 Kv . This finishes the proof of the claim.\nSo we have proved that Kx \u2286 Kv . As, by assumption, Kx is a maximal\nelement in the set {Ka \u2223 a \u2208 S/K}, we get that Kx = Kv . Since z \u2208 Kv we\nthus obtain that z \u2208 Kx , as desired.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement The authors would like to thank the referee for an\nexhaustive and detailed report that resulted in an improved paper.\nReferences\n[1] A.
