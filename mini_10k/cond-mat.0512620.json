In mesoscopic systems, an adequate\ndescription of this phenomenon is achieved in the scattering\ntheory framework.1,2 In particular, for the two-terminal setup\n(with a small voltage difference V ) it is well-known that the\nzero-frequency shot-noise spectral power is given by3,4,5\nP = P0\n\nn\nX\n\nTp (1 \u2212 Tp ) ,\n\nP0 = 2e|V |G0 ,\n\n(1)\n\np=1\n\nwhere Tp are n = min(N1 , N2 ) transmission eigenvalues of a\nconductor, G0 is the conductance quantum, and N1,2 denotes\nthe number of scattering channels in each of the two leads.\nTp are mutually correlated random numbers between 0 and 1\nwhose distribution depends on the type of the conductor.\nIn the case of chaotic cavities considered below, universal fluctuations of Tp are believed to be provided by the random matrix theory (RMT).6,7 The latter is characterized by\nthe symmetry index \u03b2, distinguishing between universality\nclasses of systems according to the absence (\u03b2 = 2, unitary\nensemble) or presence (\u03b2 = 1, orthogonal ensemble) of timereversal symmetry and spin-flip symmetry (\u03b2 = 4, symplectic ensemble). Various RMT related aspects of the shot noise\nare under active study now, both theoretically8,9,10,11,12,13,14\nand experimentally15,16 (see also the references in these papers). However, exact results for the average shot-noise power\nhP i were reported in the literature only in the limiting cases\nof N1,2 \u226b 12,17 (which is the purely classical one)8,18 or\nN1 = N2 = 1,19 the experimentally relevant case of few\nchannels being an open problem.\nAn alternative consideration was undertaken very recently\nby Braun et al.,20 who developed the semiclassical trajectory\napproach to build up the 1/N expansion for hP i, extending\nearlier results21,22 to all orders of the inverse total number of\nchannels, N = N1 + N2 (see also Ref. 23). They were able\n(for \u03b2 = 1, 2) to sum up the resulting series in a compact\nform, which we represent introducing \u03b2 as follows:\nN1 (N1 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )N2 (N2 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )\nhP i\n.\n=\nP0\n(N \u2212 2 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b24 )\n\n(2)\n\nThis result surprisingly turned out to remain valid down to\nN1,2 = 1, as was checked by comparison to numerics.\n\nOur aim here is to provide the exact RMT derivation of\nEq. (2) valid at arbitrary N1,2 and all \u03b2. There are several ways to perform the calculation. First, Tp are defined\nas the singular values of a transmission matrix t (which is\na N1 \u00d7N2 off-diagonal block of a N \u00d7N unitary scattering\nmatrix).5 Finding hP i = P0 htr [tt\u2020 (1 \u2212 tt\u2020 )]i amounts thus\nto an integration over the unitary group which is a quite complicated problem in general.24 Second, one can think of (1)\nas a linear statistic on the transmission eigenvalues, so that\nR1\nhP i = P0 0 dT \u03c1(T )T (1 \u2212 T ) is provided by the transmission eigenvalue density \u03c1(T ). Unfortunately, the latter is explicitly known only in the above-mentioned limiting cases.\nWe follow below yet another route. Contrary to the density\n\u03c1(T ), the joint probability distribution function P\u03b2 ({Tp }) of\nall transmission eigenvalues is known2 to have the following\nattractively simple form at arbitrary N1,2 :\nP\u03b2 ({Tp }) = N\u03b2\u22121 |\u2206(T )|\u03b2\n\nn\nY\n\n(\u03b2/2)(|N2 \u2212N1 |+1)\u22121\n\nTj\n\n, (3)\n\nj=1\n\nQ\nwhere \u2206(T ) = i<j (Ti \u2212 Tj ) is the Vandermonde determinant. The key idea is to appreciate a relation of (3) to the\n(integral kernel of) Selberg's integral defined as follows:25\nZ 1 Z 1\nn\nY\nTja\u22121 (1 \u2212 Tj )b\u22121 dTj\nI(a, b, c, n) \u2261\n* * * |\u2206(T )|2c\n0\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nY\nj=0\n\n0\n\nj=1\n\n\u0393(1 + c + jc)\u0393(a + jc)\u0393(b + jc)\n, (4)\n\u0393(1 + c)\u0393(a + b + (n + j \u2212 1)c)\n\nwith \u0393(x) being the gamma function. This result [as well as\nEqs. (6) and (7) below] holds generally for complex a, b and\nc with positive real parts.26 One readily sees that (3) corresponds to the following particular values of these parameters\na = (\u03b2/2)(|N2 \u2212N1 |+1) ,\n\nb = 1,\n\nand c = \u03b2/2 . (5)\n\nIt is worth noting that at these values the second line of (4)\nprovides us with the normalization constant N\u03b2 .\nSelberg's integral can be seen as a multidimensional generalization of Euler's beta function. Due to the specific structure\nof the integral kernel in (4) very useful recursion relations may\nbe established for certain moments (see Ref. 25). In particular,\nhT12 i =\n\n[a + 1 + 2c(n \u2212 1)]hT1 i \u2212 c(n \u2212 1)hT1 T2 i\na + b + 1 + 2c(n \u2212 1)\n\n(6)\n\n\f2\nthe Fano factor F = hP i/PP .

Putting above m = 1\nand taking into account (5), one easily gets from the Landauer\nformula the average conductance as follows:\nhGi = G0 nhT1 i = G0\n\nN1 N2\n,\nN \u2212 1 + 2/\u03b2\n\n(8)\n\nin agreement with Baranger and Mello.6 Equation (7) at m =\n2 gives hT1 T2 i = hT1 i(max(N1 , N2 ) \u2212 1)/(N \u2212 2 + \u03b22 ) and\nthen hT12 i follows from (6) that allows us to obtain after some\nsimple algebra the following result for the conductance variance, var(G/G0 ) = nhT12 i + n(n \u2212 1)hT1 T2 i \u2212 n2 hT1 i2 :\n2N1 (N1 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )N2 (N2 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )\nvar(G)\n.

(13)\n2 (N1 \u2212 1)(N1 + 2/\u03b2) + 2N1 + 2/\u03b2 \u2212 1\n\nAs N2 grows further, F decreases down to zero according to\nF \u2248 (N1 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )/N2 . This fact could be understood qualitatively: the lead with N2 \u226b 1 becomes almost classical with a\ndeterministic transport through it that suppresses fluctuations\nof Tp , thus P \u2192 0.28 Such a suppression of the shot noise\nin strongly asymmetric cavities was indeed observed in the\n0.4\n0.3\n\nF\n\n(10)\n\nIt would be interesting to understand whether such a relation\nholds for other types of mesoscopic conductors and how it\nis modified in other regimes (e.g., in the crossover between\nensembles).\nWe proceed now with the discussion of the obtained results.\nIn the case of uncorrelated electrons, electron transfer is a\nPoisson process that results in the value PP = 2ehIi = P0 hGi\nfor the mean power. The suppression of the actual noise (1)\nwith respect to this Poisson value is customarily described by\n\n(12)\n\n2\nThe Fano factor starts from the value \u03b2+4\n(= 52 , 31 , 14 for\n\u03b2=1, 2, 4, respectively) at n = 1 and tends to the classical\nvalue 41 as n \u2192 \u221e. For the orthogonal or unitary ensemble\n(\u03b2 =1 or 2) this is a monotonic decrease in n, whereas for\nsymplectic ensemble (\u03b2 = 4) F has a minimum \u2248 0.225 at\nn \u2248 2. Figure 1 illustrates these dependencies. The shot noise\nis always suppressed more strongly in the symplectic case.\nIn the general case of asymmetric cavities, it is instructive to\nconsider the Fano factor at given fixed number N1 of channels\nin one lead as a function of the channel number N2 in the other\nlead. One easily finds from (11) (see Fig. 2) that F starts from\nthe value \u03b2N21 +4 at N2 = 1 and then develops a maximum at\np\nN2\u2217 = (N1 \u2212 1)(N1 + 2/\u03b2)+1\u22122/\u03b2, taking the following\nvalue at the maximum:\n\n0.2\n\n2 G0 hP ihGi\n= N1 N2 .\n\u03b2 P0 var(G)\n\n(11)\n\nat arbitrary N1,2 . In the semiclassical limit of large number of channels, N1,2 \u226b 1, one readily gets from (11) F \u2248\nN1 N2 /N 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b22 )(N12 \u2212 N1 N2 + N22 )/N 3 , i.e. the known\nclassical value and the first weak-localization correction.2,7\nIn the symmetric case, N1 = N2 = n, Eq. (11) reduces to\n\n\u03b2=4\n1\n\n(N1 \u2212 1 + 2/\u03b2)(N2 \u2212 1 + 2/\u03b2)\n(N \u2212 2 + 2/\u03b2)(N \u2212 1 + 4/\u03b2)\n\n0.1\n\nN1=2\n\nN1=5\n\nN1=10\n\nN1=20\n\nN1=1\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nN2\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFIG. 2: The Fano factor at fixed number N1 of channels in one lead\nand varied one N2 in the other lead.

In this case the classical result\nF = \u03b7/(1 + \u03b7)2 applies.]\nIn summary, we have exactly calculated the average shot\nnoise power at an arbitrary number of open channels by relating the problem to Selberg's integral. The proposed method\nis not restricted by linear statistics only and may be applied\nfurther to study, e.g., higher-order charge fluctuations as well\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n\n17\n\nYa.
