We\ncompare charmed meson and baryon production to accelerator data.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe cosmic ray event generator Sibyll [1, 2] is a relatively simple model that is able to reproduce many\nfeatures of hadronic interactions in fixed target and\ncollider experiments. Sibyll is based on the dual parton model (DPM) [3\u20135], the Lund Monte Carlo algorithms [6, 7], and the minijet model [8\u201311], allowing\nmultiple hard and soft interactions. The hard and soft\ninteractions are discriminated by an energy-dependent\ntransverse momentum cutoff. The hard interaction\ncross section is calculated according to the minijet\nmodel. Diffraction dissociation is implemented as a\ntwo-channel eikonal model based on the Good-Walker\nmodel [12]. For hadron-nucleus interactions, the interaction probability for each nucleon inside the nucleus\nis calculated based on the impact parameter distribution. The total interaction cross section is calculated using the Glauber scattering theory [13]. For\na nucleus-nucleus interaction the semi-superposition\nmodel [14] is used to determine the point of first interaction for the nucleons of the projectile nucleus.\nThe fragmentation region is emphasized as appropriate for air shower simulations. Version 2.1 has been\navailable since 1999.\nThe new version 2.2c has charmed quark and antiquark added to the u, d, s quarks and anti-quarks,\nand gluons which are present in version 2.1. Small\nupdates have also been made to give better agreement with experimental data. Addition of charmed\nquark is especially relevant to air shower simulation\nstudies of neutrino detection: the short-lived charmed\nparticles create \"prompt\" muons and neutrinos in the\natmosphere with a harder spectrum and isotropic distribution, whose contributions are searched for in the\natmospheric muon and neutrino spectrum. A proper\nrepresentation of charmed particles is thus very important for simulations involving neutrino experiments.\nIn the following sections, we describe how the\ncharmed quark is added to Sibyll, and compare the\ncharmed meson and baryon predictions with experimental data. Hereafter, a \"q quark\" includes both\nInsert PSN Here\n\nthe quark and anti-quark unless specified.\n\nII.\n\nCHARM INCLUSION\n\nThe following charmed particles have been added:\nmesons D, D\u22c6 families, \u03b7c , and J/\u03c8; and baryons\n0\n\u03a3c , \u03a3\u22c6c , \u039ec , \u039e\u22c6c families, \u039b+\nc , and \u03a9c .\nCharmed particles are formed throughout the whole\nfragmentation process. The basic assumption is that c\nquarks form in all processes where s quarks form, but\nwith lower frequency. This is realised in the Monte\nCarlo by replacing production of an ss\u0304 pair by a cc\u0304\npair with a frequency Pc /Ps = 0.004. The numerical\nvalue is adjusted for a best fit to the data. For comparison, Ps /Pd = Pus /Pud = 0.3. Valence s-quarks\n(for example in kaon projectiles) are excluded from\nthis substitution process. This procedure ensures that\nall charm production coming from hard and soft processes are covered. The cross section is controlled by\nthe branching ratio.\nIn a collision, the leading particle carries a valance\nquark or diquark of the projectile, in contrast to the\nnon-leading ones. Leading particles therefore are more\nabundantly produced in the forward region, i.e. large\nFeynman xF , resulting in an asymmetry between leading and non-leading particles. This leading quark effect is well established in charm hadroproduction. For\nexample, the quark composition of a proton projectile\n\u2212\nfavours \u039b+\nc over \u039b\u0304c as leading particles. Charmed\nparticles formed via fragmentation allows the leading\nquark effect to be observed [15] .\nThe momenta assigned to the charmed particles differs from non-charmed particles to give a harder spectrum. While the non-charmed particles follow the\nLund fragmentation function, the heavier charmed\nparticle fragments according to the Peterson/SLAC\nfragmentation function [16]\n\" \u0012\n\u00132 #\u22121\n1\n\u01ebQ\nf (z) \u221d z 1 \u2212\n,\n\u2212\nz\n1\u2212z\n\n(1)\n\n\fXVI International Symposium on Very High Energy Cosmic Ray Interactions\nISVHECRI 2010, Batavia, IL, USA (28 June 2 July 2010)\n\nwhere p0 = 1.5 GeV/c and 1.0 GeV/c for baryons and\nmesons, respectively. This setting results in a higher\nhpT i for charmed particles, compared to other quarks\nand diquarks where the hpT i ranges from 0.3 to 0.6\nGeV/c.\nCharmed particles are produced in the interactions\nof high-energy primary cosmic rays. The quick decay\nof these charmed particles form the \"prompt\" muons\nand neutrinos in the atmosphere. These prompt leptons are expected to have an isotropic angular distribution and a harder spectrum than particles produced\nfrom ordinary decay of pions and kaons. Because of\ntheir relatively hard spectrum and isotropy, prompt\nneutrinos are a significant background in the search\nfor astrophysical neutrino signals above 100 TeV.\nAdditional minor modifications with respect to\nSibyll 2.1 have been made in version 2.2c. These\ninclude improvements in treatment of diffraction, increasing the s quark fraction and fixing a bug in the\nenergy dependence of the cutoff of pT . These changes\ngive a higher multiplicity and a smoother transition\nto diffraction in the forward direction.\n\nIII.\n\n2.2c\n\nElab = 800 GeV (x 10)\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nElab = 400 GeV\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n6\n\n7\n\nxF\n3\n\n10\n\n2.2c\n\nElab = 800 GeV (x 10)\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nElab = 400 GeV\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\npT2 [GeV2]\n\nFIG. 1: Differential cross section distributions of xF (upper panel) and p2T (lower panel) for p-p collisions producing\nDs from Sibyll 2.2c plotted against data from LEBCEHS (Elab = 400 GeV) and LEBC-MPS (Elab = 800\nGeV). For clarity purpose, the simulation results and data\nfor LEBC-MPS has been multiplied by factor 10.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH DATA\n\nMost information on differential behaviour is obtained from fixed target experiments, with hadronhadron or hadron-nuclei collisions. Distributions of\nFeynman xF and transverse momenta p2T from the\nLEBC bubble chambers, E769, and SELEX experiments are used to compare the charmed meson and\nbaryon behaviour with Sibyll 2.2c.\nThe two bubble chamber experiments LEBC-EHS\n[17] at Elab = 400 GeV and LEBC-MPS [18] at\nElab = 800 GeV used p-p interactions to search for\nproduction of all D particles. Figure 1 compares the D\nproduction of Sibyll 2.2c to xF and p2T distributions\nof the differential cross sections. All the comparisons\nshow good agreement with data.\nThe E769 experiment [19] used p, \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 projectiles on a variety of nuclear targets to obtain the xF\nand p2T behaviour of the D mesons, where the differential cross sections are given per target nucleon.\nWithin the perturbative QCD treatment of heavy particle production, the incident hadron sees the nucleus\nas individual nucleons.

Such behaviour has been verified by\nthe E769 and WA82 [20] experiments. Nuclear scaling of the target has been upheld in the simulations,\nand a proton target has been used to compare with the\ndata. Figure 2 shows the D production of Sibyll 2.2c\nplotted against the E769 data. The overall agreement\nwith data is good, although the simulated p2T spectra\nare somewhat softer than data.\nThe SELEX experiment [15] used \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03a3\u2212 projectiles at Elab = 615 GeV and p projectile at Elab =\n540 GeV, on a variety of nuclear targets to obtain the\ndistribution of charmed baryon. The leading quark\neffect in charm hadroproduction of baryons can be\ntested, as the lack of anti-quarks in the baryon beams\n\u03a3\u2212 and p favours quark over anti-quark and an asym\u2212\nmetry between \u039b+\nc and \u039b\u0304c production is expected.\nSELEX observed such an asymmetry with the baryon\nbeams and reported a relatively flat and hard xF distribution, fitting to the parameterisation of (1\u2212xF )2.5 .\nAs only the number of events of the distribution of xF\n\n\fXVI International Symposium on Very High Energy Cosmic Ray Interactions\nISVHECRI 2010, Batavia, IL, USA (28 June 2 July 2010)\nand p2T are given with no absolute cross section measurement, the normalisation suggested by Ref. [21]\nhas been adopted, where the SELEX data are multiplied by 7\u03bcb/nucleon. In the simulation, \u03c0 \u2212 and p\nbeams are used against nitrogen nuclei target. Comparison of Sibyll 2.2c with the data is shown in Fig. 3.\nFor the proton beam, the shape of both xF and p2T for\n\u039b+\nc distribution are in agreement though they appear\nto be over-produced using the current normalisation.\nFor the \u03c0 \u2212 beam, the \u039b+\nc are underproduced with a\nslightly harder p2T distribution. Due to the lack of\ncross section information, we are less concerned with\nthe overall scaling. The simulation agrees with the\ngeneral trend of the data.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA new version of Sibyll 2.2c has been presented.\nThis version is updated from the existing version 2.1\nto include production of charmed quarks.
