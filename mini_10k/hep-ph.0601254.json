This approach\nallows for a good analytical control over the expressions, but also provides stable numerical representations in phase space regions which typically pose numerical problems. Some applications\nare also presented.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this decade high energy physics will explore\nthe TeV scale with hadron colliders like the Tevatron and the LHC. The Tevatron experiments\nalready have provided rich information on electroweak, jet and heavy quark physics. These data\nand their theoretical description are of major importance for Higgs and New Physics searches. A\ndetailed understanding of Standard Model processes is indispensable to discriminate between\nsignals and backgrounds in this respect. This is\nespecially true in hadronic collisions at the TeV\nscale because of the complicated multi-particle\nfinal states. It is well known that leading order QCD predictions are generally plagued by\nlarge renormalization/factorization scale uncertainties. Only the inclusion of higher order corrections may lead to more stable predictions, as\nleading logarithmic contributions typically cancel in that case. Moreover, it should be emphasized that not only the overall normalization is\nan issue here, higher order corrections can also\nchange the shapes of distributions. The knowledge of distribution shapes is particularly important in those cases where backgrounds measured\n\n2. Reduction formalism\nAny given amplitude can be represented as a\nlinear combination of Feynman diagrams, which\ncorrespond to linear combinations of tensor integrals. We define tensor integrals by\n\n\u2217 Work\n\nsupported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\n(DFG), grant number Bi1050/1-2.\n\u2020 Work supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), contract number 200020-109162.\n\nZ\n1\n\nn, \u03bc1 ...\u03bcr\n(a1 , . . . , ar ) =\nIN\nqa\u03bc11 . . . qa\u03bcrr\ndk\u0304 2\n2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b4) ,\n(q1 \u2212 m21 + i\u03b4) . . .

One of the advantages\nof this representation is that the combinations\nqi = k + ri appear naturally (e.g. fermion propagators). When introducing form factors, the\nLorentz structure is carried by difference vectors\n\u2206\u03bcij = ri\u03bc \u2212 rj\u03bc and g \u03bc\u03bd . As an example, consider\nthe rank 2 case\nX\nn,\u03bc1 \u03bc2\n(a1 , a2 ; S) =\nIN\n\u2206\u03bcl11a1 \u2206\u03bcl22a2 AN,2\nl1 l2 (S)\n\nwhere the subscript \"fin\" indicates that the respective integral is infrared finite. The algorithm\nallows to isolate recursively all infrared poles in\nterms of three-point integrals.\nThe reduction of tensor integrals is performed\nin a similar way. We add and subtract a linear\ncombination of pinched terms and adjust the coefficients conveniently:\nn,\u03bc1 ...\u03bcr\n(a1 , . . . , ar ; S) =\nIN\n\u03bc\nX \u03bc Z\nPj qa\u03bc22 . . . qarar\nQ\n\u2212\nCja11\ndk\u0304\ni\u2208S Pi\nj\u2208S\ni\nh\nP\n\u03bc1\nZ\nqa\u03bc22 . . . qa\u03bcrr\nqa\u03bc11 + j\u2208S Cja\nP\nj\n1\nQ\n+ dk\u0304\ni\u2208S Pi\n\nl1 ,l2 \u2208S\n\n+ g \u03bc1 \u03bc2 B N,2 (S) .\nThe kinematical information is encoded in the\nmatrix Sij = (ri \u2212 rj )2 \u2212 m2i \u2212 m2j which is the\ncharacteristic object in any Feynman parameter\nintegral. After momentum integration, the scalar\nN -point function is of the form\nn\nn\n(S) = (\u22121)N \u0393(N \u2212 )\nIN\n2\nZ Y\nN\nN\nX\n\u0001 n \u2212N\nzl ) R 2 2\ndzi \u03b4(1 \u2212\n\u00d7\ni=1\n\nR2 = \u2212\n\nl=1\n\nN\nX\n\n1\nzi Sij zj \u2212 i\u03b4 .\n2 i,j=1\n\nTensor integrals lead to additional factors zi in\nthe numerator. As a shorthand notation we use\nthe ordered set S of propagator labels instead of\nthe matrix S as our function arguments. A matrix corresponding to an integral with propagator\n1/Pj = 1/(qj2 \u2212 m2j + i\u03b4) omitted (\"pinched\") corresponds to an index set S \\ {j}. The reduction\nof scalar integrals can now be written as\nZ\nX\nPi\nn\nIN (S) =\nbi (S)\ndk\u0304 Q\nj\u2208S Pj\ni\u2208S\nP\nZ\n1 \u2212 i\u2208S bi (S) Pi\nQ\n+ dk\u0304\nj\u2208S Pj\n!\n\n=\n\nIdiv (S) + If in (S) .\nP\nbi (S) Sij = 1 is fulOne can show [5] that if\ni\u2208S\n\nfilled, then\n\nIf in (S) =\nB(S) =\n\nn+2\n\u2212B(S) (N \u2212 n \u2212 1) IN\n(S) ,\nX\nbi (S) ,\ni\u2208S\n\nB(S) det S\n\n=\n\n(\u22121)N +1 det G, Gij = 2 ri * rj ,\n\n!\n\n= Idiv + If in\nP \u03bc\nCi a (S) Sij = \u2206\u03bcj a for all j \u2208 S, then If in is\nIf\ni\u2208S\n\nproportional to a sum of higher dimensional inten+2m\ngrals IN\n(m > 0) and thus IR finite. In this\nway, the tensor integrals also can be reduced to\na set of (potentially IR divergent) integrals with\nlower rank and less propagators and an infrared\nfinite part.

Therefore one has for N > 5:\nn, \u03bc1 ...\u03bcr\n(a1 , . . . , ar ; S) =\nIN\nX \u03bc\nn, \u03bc ...\u03bc\nr\n\u2212\nCj ar IN \u221211 r\u22121 (a1 , . . . , ar\u22121 ; S \\ {j}) .\nj\u2208S\n\nNote that N and the tensor rank are reduced\nat the same time.\nThe case N = 5 is\n\n\f3\nmore involved, but a reduction scheme has been\nworked out where no higher dimensional inten+2m\ngrals IN\n(m > 0) are present for N > 4 and\nno inverse Gram determinants are introduced [5].\nAs in the scalar case, an algebraic separation of\nIR poles, contained in 3-point integrals only, is\nachieved iteratively.\nApplication of the reduction formulas to integrals of rank r \u2264 2 leads, for any N , to form\nfactors in terms of simple scalar integrals. For\nrank r > 2, reduction to purely scalar integrals\nwith N = 3, 4 is no longer possible without introducing a tower of higher dimensional integrals.\nTo avoid the latter, we use integrals with Feynman parameters in the numerator as reduction\nendpoints. Explicit representations for all form\nfactors for r \u2264 N \u2264 5 can be found in [5]. The\nform factors are expressed in terms of the following basis integrals\n\u0010\nn\u0011\nI3n (j1 , . . . , jr ) = \u2212\u0393 3 \u2212\n2\nP3\nZ 1Y\n3\nzj . . . zj \u03b4(1 \u2212 l=1 zl )\n, (2)\ndzi 1 1 r\n\u00d7\n(\u2212 2 z * S * z)3\u2212n/2\n0 i=1\n\u0010\nn\u0011\nI3n+2 (j1 ) = \u2212\u0393 2 \u2212\n2\nP3\nZ 1Y\n3\nzj1 \u03b4(1 \u2212 l=1 zl )\ndzi\n,\n\u00d7\n(\u2212 12 z * S * z)2\u2212n/2\n0 i=1\n\u0010\nn\u0011\nI4n+2 (j1 , . . . , jr ) = \u0393 3 \u2212\n2\nP\nZ 1Y\n4\nzj1 . . . zjr \u03b4(1 \u2212 4l=1 zl )\ndzi\n\u00d7\n, (3)\n(\u2212 12 z * S * z)3\u2212n/2\n0 i=1\n\u0010\nn\u0011\nI4n+4 (j1 ) = \u0393 2 \u2212\n2\nP4\nZ 1Y\n4\nzj1 \u03b4(1 \u2212 l=1 zl )\ndzi\n\u00d7\n,\n(\u2212 12 z * S * z)2\u2212n/2\n0 i=1\nwhere rmax = 3 in eqs. (2) and (3), and of course\npurely scalar integrals I3n , I3n+2 , I4n+2 , I4n+4 are\nalso basis integrals. We provide two alternatives\nfor the evaluation of the basis integrals. On one\nhand, an algebraic reduction to scalar integrals\ncan be performed. This leads to representations\nwith inverse Gram determinants. As long as the\nGram determinant \u2013 or more precisely the related\nquantity B \u223c det G/ det S \u2013 is sufficiently large,\n\nsuch a representation is numerically safe. On the\nother hand, if the Gram determinants become\nsmaller than a certain cut parameter \u039b, a direct\nnumerical evaluation of the building blocks of the\nreduction is performed.\n3.

Let us focus\non the basis integrals with d = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb, N = 3\nand d = 6, N = 4. The other cases contain UV\ndivergencies which are isolated in terms of external \u0393(N \u2212 d/2) factors. After expansion of the\nintegrand in \u01eb, the pole part is a trivial integral\nand the finite part is a logarithmic integral which\ncan be treated with the same contour deformation\nmethods as discussed below. IR divergencies are\nonly present for N = 3 and d = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb. For the\nIR divergent integrals explicit analytical formulas can be found in [5]. The numerical evaluation\nof the remaining IR finite integrals is problematic due to kinematical singularities, which occur\nif the quadratic form x * S * x changes sign. We\npropose the following solution: We first make a\nsector decomposition\n1=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b8(xl > x1 , . . . , xl\u22121 , xl+1 , . . . , xN ) .\n\nl=1\n\nThe integral is thus split into N terms:\nd\nIN\n(j1 , . . . , jr ) = (\u22121)N \u0393(N \u2212 d/2)\nN\nX\n\nJl (N, d, j1 , . . . , jr ) .\n\nl=1\n\nIn sector l one applies the variable transformation\nxj = tj xl for (j < l), xj = tj\u22121 xl for (j > l) and\nintegrates out xl with the \u03b4 distribution. Defining\n\n\f4\nT~ = (t1 , . . . , tl\u22121 , 1, tl , . . . , tN \u22121 ) gives\nJl (N, d, j1 , . . . , jr ) =\n\nI4n+2 (1|j1 |j1 , j2 |j1 , j2 , j3 ), I4n+4 (1|j1 )\n\nZ1\n\ndN \u22121 t\n\n\u00d7\u0010\n\nT * S * T /2 \u2212 i\u03b4\n\nTj\n\nj=1\n\n0\n\nTj1 . . . Tjr\n\nN\n\u0010X\n\n\u0011N \u2212d\u2212r\n\n\u0011N \u2212d/2 .\n\nN \u22121\nN\n\u22121\nX\n1 X\nB j tj + C = 0\nAjk tj tk +\n2\nj=1\nj,k=1\n\nA, B, C are defined by S. For the sector integrals Jl the following contour deformation,\nparametrized by \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0, \u03bb \u2265 0, leads to smooth\nintegrands [5,14]\n~x(~t) = ~t \u2212 i ~\u03c4 (~t)\n\u03c4k\n\nanalytic\nB > \u039b\u22122\n\nQ(t) = T * S * T /2 leads to singular behaviour if\nQ(t) =\n\nnumerical\n\n\u03b2\n= \u03bb t\u03b1\nk (1 \u2212 tk )\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n(Ajk tj + Bk )\n\nj=1\n\nWhile \u03bb\u2207 * Q controls the size of the deformation,\nthe parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 control the smoothness of the\ndeformation at the integration boundaries. There\nare situations where the contour deformation is\nnot possible. This happens if \u2207*Q = 0 and Q = 0.\nThis exceptional kinematic situation occurs in the\npresence of normal or anomalous thresholds and\ncannot be avoided. The way to deal with it is to\nNP\n\u22121\n\u22121\nsplit the integrations at tj = \u2212\nAjl\nBl if necl=1\n\nessary. Typically the proposed contour deformation method works well, although the CPU time\nfor evaluating a basis integral is much larger than\nevaluating the corresponding analytical representations. The conclusion for the practitioner is\nto use the fast and accurate algebraic formulas\nfor the \"bulk\" of the phase space and switch to\nthe slow but reliable numerical evaluation near\ncritical phase space regions. In the case of 4point functions this looks schematically as shown\nin Fig. 1.\n4. Applications\nOur reduction algorithm has been applied so\nfar to several processes [15,16,17,18].

Although only box graphs occur,\nthe large number of invariants (s, t, p23 , p24 , mb , mt )\nmakes the process sufficiently involved to provide\na good testing ground for our method. The helicity amplitudes \u0393++ , \u0393+\u2212 were computed in a\nmodular way. The amplitude was decomposed\ninto gauge invariant terms and was reduced completely to d = 6 box, d = 4 triangle and bubble\nintegrals. As an illustration we show the invariant mass distribution of the charged lepton pair\nfor gg \u2192 W \u2217 W \u2217 \u2192 l\u03bd\u0304  \u0304l\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 in Fig. 2. Numerically instable regions are confined to very small\nphase space regions which do not contribute to\nthe result inside the errors.\nAnother application of our reduction procedure\nwas the first direct computation of the gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3g\none-loop amplitude. Although the amplitude\ncould be indirectly deduced from the gg \u2192 ggg\nloop result [13], it was shown that very compact results could be obtained for all six independent helicity amplitudes [17]. This result is\n\n\f5\none\u2013 and multi-loop Feynman diagrams is being\nfurther investigated.\nWe have shown that our analytical reduction\nmethod works well for processes of phenomenological interest like photon pair plus jet production or off-shell vector boson pair production at\nthe LHC. Applications to LHC processes with a\nlarger number of external particles are presently\nbeing studied.\n\n0.5\n\nd\u03c3 / dmll [ fb ]\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nREFERENCES\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nmll [ GeV ]\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFigure 2.

Summary\nFor a precise understanding of LHC phenomenology, NLO precision for multi-particle amplitudes is mandatory. We have presented a new\nsemi-numerical approach for 1-loop multi-leg processes which is valid for an arbitrary number of\nmassless as well as massive internal/external particles. It allows to isolate IR divergences transparently and in an automated way from the amplitude. Our reduction algorithm uses a set of\nbuilding blocks which can be evaluated either analytically, if the inherent Gram determinants are\nsufficiently large, or numerically, avoiding inverse\nGram determinants and the associated instabilities completely. To achieve the latter, a multidimensional contour deformation method for 1loop parameter integrals was developed. The full\npotential of the contour deformation method for\n\n1. A. Denner and S.
