It is important that LHC experiments are able to detect\nhadronic SMP with masses around the TeV scale. To do this, an understanding of\nthe interactions of SMPs in matter is required.

Searches are therefore routinely made for SMPs bound in matter, and for SMPs at cosmic ray and collider\nexperiments [1, 2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, SMPs with masses at the TeV scale are anticipated\nin a number of beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios, such as supersymmetry and universal\nextra dimensions [4]. SMP searches are thus a key component of the early data exploitation\nprogram of the LHC experiments [5]. To facilitate such searches, models are needed of the\ninteractions of SMP as they pass through matter, since such interactions can give rise to a\nrange of different event topologies [4]. Although robust phenomenological approaches are\navailable to predict the scattering of electromagnetically charged SMPs, it is not clear how\nthe interactions of hadronic SMPs (hereafter termed R-hadronsb) should be treated owing\nto uncertainties associated with the strong scattering processes and the hadronic mass hierarchy. This paper describes an implementation within Geant-4 [6] and extension of a\nRegge-based model [7] for hadronic scattering. The paper is a summary of work contained\nin Ref. [8].\nTo aid the development of search strategies, it is important that experiments have access\nto Monte Carlo models which span as fully as possible the range of conceivable signatures\nwhich could be associated with R-hadron production. At present, one model is available\nwithin Geant-4 [9]. This model, hereafter termed the generic model, is based on a black\ndisk approximation [10] and employs pragmatic assumptions regarding possible scattering\nprocesses and stable R-hadron species. This work concerns an approach, hereafter termed\nthe Regge model, which uses triple regge formalism to predict the scattering of R-hadrons\nformed from exotic colour triplet squarks (stop-like (t\u0303) and sbottom-like (b\u0303)) and electrically\nneutral gluino-like (g\u0303) colour octet particles. Furthermore, the model uses a different set\nof well motivated assumptions regarding R-hadron mass hierarchies than those employed in\nthe generic model.\na The\n\nterm stable is taken to mean that the particle will not decay during its traversal of a detector.\nterm R-hadron has its origin in the R-parity quantum number in supersymmetry theories and the\nwork in this paper will be presented in the context of supersymmetric particles. However, the results are\ngenerally applicable to stable heavy exotic hadrons.\nb The\n\nDIS 2009\n\n\f2\n\nHeavy hadron mass hierarchy\n\nAlthough there exist no complete calculations of expected R-hadron mass spectra, estimates\nhave been made using a variety of approaches such as the bag model [11, 12, 13] and lattice\nQCD [14]. These predictions, together with with measurements of heavy hadron masses,\nmake it possible to approximately determine those features of the mass hierarchies which are\nmost relevant for the modelling of R-hadron scattering in material. Of particular interest\nare the masses of the lowest lying states, to which higher mass particles would be expected\nto decay before being able to interact hadronically.\nGiven the observed spin and flavour independence of interactions of heavy quarks with\nlight quarks [15] the lightest meson and baryon states can be inferred [16] from the measured mass spectra of charm and bottom hadrons. Thus, charged and neutral squark-based\nmesons would be approximately mass degenerate and the lightest baryon state to which the\nother baryons would decay would be the scalar singlet q\u0303ud i.e. the exotic equivalent of the\n\u039bc ,\u039bb baryons. This picture is supported by calculations of hyperfine splittings of R-hadron\nmasses [16, 10].\nThe basic properties of gluino R-hadrons may not be similarly inferred from Standard\nModel hadronic mass spectra and a greater reliance on phenomenological approaches is required to estimate the stable states. Possible hadrons include gluino R-mesons\n(g\u0303u\u016b0 , g\u0303ud \u03040 , g\u0303dd \u03040 ) and gluino-gluon states (g\u0303g). Bag model [11] and lattice QCD [14] calculations estimate that the masses of lowest lying states of each of these hadrons differ by\nless than a pion mass. Detailed calculations of the lowest lying baryon states [12, 13] using\nthe bag model predict that the lightest state is the singlet g\u0303uds. Consequently, higher mass\nstates would decay weakly into the singlet state over a time scale of \u223c 10\u221210 s [13].\nFor the work presented here, we use the squark and gluino R-hadron mass hierarchy\nassumptions given above and use a simplified mass spectra which comprises only those Rhadrons deemed to be stable. This leads to R-hadron event topologies which would be\nchallenging for the one of the most common collider search methods, which looks for a slow\nmuon-like object [5, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This is due to the R-baryon production processes which\ntake place as R-hadron pass through matter. Such processes, which, as discussed in the next\nsection, imply that a sbottom or gluino R-hadron, irrespective of its state as it entered a\ncalorimeter, is likely to leave as an uncharged object and therefore escape detection in an\nouter muon chamber.\n2.1\n\nRegge Model\n\nSince the central picture of a low energy light quark system interacting with a stationary\nnucleon [10], R-hadron scattering can be treated with the phenomenology used to describe\nlow energy hadron-hadron scattering data [7, 21, 22], as is done in the Regge model of which\nmore details can be found in Ref. [7]. The Regge model was originally developed to describe\nsquark R-hadron scattering though has been extended here to also treat gluino R-hadrons.\nThis model assumes the stable states described in the previous section.\nUsing parameters fitted to low energy hadron-hadron data, the Regge model makes\npredictions for R-hadron scattering cross sections, together with energy loss calculations\nbased on the triple regge formalism. Fig. 1 (left) shows the the model predictions of the\nscattering cross sections of a squark-based R-hadron off a stationary nucleon within a nucleus\ncomprising equal numbers of neutrons and protons. The cross section is shown for different\nDIS 2009\n\n\fFigure 1: Cross sections for stop-based and gluino-based R-hadrons. The predictions are\nshown for the Regge model (solid lines) and the generic model (dashed lines).\n\ntypes of squark-based R-hadrons as a function of the Lorentz factor \u03b3. As can be seen,\n \u0304 interactions which is due to a dominant\n \u0304 d)\nthere is a large cross section for antibaryon (q\u0303\u016b\nannihilation process with a nucleon in the target.\nIt is also seen that, at lower values of \u03b3 (\u03b3 <\n\u223c10), the scattering cross section of squark \u0304 is larger than for antisquarkbased R-hadrons containing a light valence antiquark (q\u0303 \u016b0 , q\u0303 d)\nbased R-mesons, which arises from the presence of reggeon exchange processes which are\nonly permitted for R-hadrons containing a light anti-quark. Owing to the presence of an\nadditional light quark the scattering cross section for R-baryons (q\u0303ud) is twice as large as\nfor the mesons with light quarks.\nUpon an interaction, the probability that a R-meson to R-meson process gives rise to\ncharge exchange is 50%. Similarly, the probability of an interaction in which a R-meson\nbecomes a baryon is 10%. Once a R-hadron becomes a baryon it stays in this state. Another\nprocess which must be taken into account is the oscillation of a neutral mesonic squark-based\nR-hadron into its antiparticle. Since the conversion rate would be model dependent we allow\ntwo possibilities here: zero mixing, in which no oscillations take place, and a maximal mixing\nscenario in which there is a 50% probability that any neutral mesonic squark-based R-hadron\nwhich was produced would automatically be converted to its anti-particle.\nIn Fig. 1 (right) the predicted cross sections for gluino R-hadron species are shown. The\nbaryon cross section is 50% greater than that of stop R-hadrons owing to the extra light\nquark in the gluino R-hadron. Also, since the gluino meson contains a light quark and\nanti-quark, then both regge and pomeron exchange processes are available. Again, a baryon\nnumber transfer probability of 10% is used. A probability of 31 is assigned to R-meson to\nR-meson processes involving charge exchanges of 0, \u00b1e or \u00b12e.\nDIS 2009\n\n\fFigure 2: Number of hadronic interactions (left) and total energy loss (right) for R-hadrons\nof 300 GeV mass sent through 1m of iron. The top (bottom) plots show predictions for stop\n \u0304\n(gluino) R-hadrons which entered the iron in the state t\u0303d \u0304 (g\u0303ud).\n\n2.2\n\nImplementation of Regge Model in Geant-4\n\nIn the dynamical picture of R-hadron scattering used by Geant, the light quark system\nis decoupled from the heavy spectator parton before interacting with a nucleon according\nto Geant's parameterised model for light hadrons. In this way secondary particles and\nso-called black tracks were generated. Following the interaction, the light quark system is\nrecombined with the heavy parton.\nTo implement the Regge model in Geant-4, the software architecture used for the generic\nmodel was adapted. The scattering cross sections and available baryon states were altered\nand the relative rates of the available processes were adapted to match the prescription in\nthe above section. Using single particle simulations, it was verified that the main features\n(energy loss and charge exchange) of the Regge model were well reproduced in the Geant-4\nimplementation.\n\n3\n\nInteractions and Energy Loss\n\nTo estimate the effects of scattering on R-hadrons at the LHC simulations were made of the\npassage through iron of R-hadrons of 300 GeV mass. The kinematic distributions of the\nR-hadrons were given by the Pythia generator which simulated the direct pair production\n \u0304 b\u0303 \u0304b\u0303 and g\u0303g\u0303 in proton-proton collisions at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy.\nof t\u0303t\u0303,\nThe total energy loss for R-hadrons passing through 1m of iron is shown in Fig. 2. Stop\n \u0304\nR-hadrons which start in the state t\u0303d \u0304 typically lose more energy than gluino R-hadrons (g\u0303ud)\nwhich start with the same charge. This occurs due to the rapid conversion of mesons to\nbaryons. Since the gluino (stop) baryon is predicted to be of zero (positive) charge, it loses\nfar less energy. Also shown is the number of hadronic interactions. Owing to the additional\nlight quarks in the gluino R-hadrons more scattering occurs in this case than for the stop\nR-hadrons. A no-mixing scenario is assumed here.\nDIS 2009\n\n\f4\n\nSummary\n\nAn implementation and extension of a Regge-based approach to squark and gluino-based\nR-hadron scattering has been implemented in Geant-4. The work allows the modelling of\nthe energy loss and the transformation of R-hadrons as they propagate through material.\nSlides containing the presented work can be found in [23]\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDavid Milstead is a Royal Swedish Academy Research Fellow supported by a grant from the\nKnut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
