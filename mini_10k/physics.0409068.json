The quality factors of the resonator modal\nfields are estimated to be on the order of a few thousands. The electromagnetic field is\nshown to be guided by the defect. Good agreement is found between the measured\nand calculated spectrum.\n\n\fRing resonators are versatile elements with various applications ranging from\ntelecommunication and sensing to basic scientific research [1-5]. During the last few\nyears, considerable effort has been focused on improving the quality factors (Q) of\nresonators and reducing their modal volume (see e.g. Refs. [5, 6] and references\ntherein).\nRecently, we proposed a novel type of annular resonator based on radial Bragg\nreflection [7, 8]. These devices, named annular Bragg resonators (ABR), offer smaller\ndimensions compared to conventional resonators which employ total internal\nreflection (TIR), while retaining high Q. In addition, such structures exhibit superior\nsensitivity compared to conventional resonators for biological and chemical sensing\napplications [9]. This class of resonators is closely related to the family of circulargratings DBR resonators which also exhibit lasing patterns with low angular\npropagation coefficients [10, 11].\nIn this letter, we report on the observation of photoluminescence and lasing from\nABRs realized in semiconductor material (see Fig. 1). The structure consisted of a\ncircumferentially guiding defect surrounded by radial Bragg reflectors. Due to the\ncircular geometry, the optimal layer widths required to confine the light in the defect\nare not constant but rather monotonically decreasing with the radial distance. The\nwidths of the layers are determined by the zeros and extrema of the Bessel function of\norder m where m is the angular propagation coefficient of the mode for which the\ndevice was designed. For simplicity, we label the separation between a zero and the\nnearest extremum and between successive zeros as \"quarter-wavelength\" and \"halfwavelength\" respectively. Although these distances are not constant across the device,\ntheir role in the construction of the distributed reflector is similar to that of their\nCartesian counterparts [12]. The reflector layers could also be of higher Bragg order\n(i.e., 3/4\u03bb, 5/4\u03bb, etc. in the same notation). Although such an approach requires more\nBragg layers to confine the light in the defect (compared to reflector based on \u03bb/4\nlayers), it facilitates the fabrication of the devices. The defect width of an ABR is a\nmultiple integer of \"half-wavelength\", meaning its interfaces are located at zeroes of\nthe field.\nABRs of several geometries and Bragg reflector orders were fabricated within a\n250nm thick membrane of InGaAsP with six 75\u01fa quantum wells (QW) positioned at\nthe center. After the ABR patterns were etched into the active material, the original\n\n\fInP substrate was removed and the membrane was transferred to a sapphire plate\nusing an ultraviolet curable optical adhesive to improve the vertical confinement of\nthe electromagnetic field in the device [13].\nTo simplify the design and the modeling of the devices we employed the effective\nindex approximation in the vertical dimension. The effective index of the membrane\nwas found to be approximately 2.8 for the Hz polarization and 2.09 for the Ez\npolarization. Since the Hz polarization is more confined than the Ez polarization and\nthe optical gain of the compressively strained QW structure used favors the Hz\npolarization [14], we optimized the radial structure to this polarization [8].\nTo facilitate the fabrication of the devices, a mixed Bragg order approach was adopted\n[8]. The high-index Bragg layers (neff=2.8) were 3/4\u03bb wide (second order) and the\nlow-index layers (neff=1.0 for air gaps and neff=1.54 for adhesive filled gaps) were\n\u03bb/4 wide (first order). In addition to the relaxed fabrication tolerances, such a layer\nstructure improves the vertical confinement (larger material filling factor) and induces\nefficient vertical emission. While the latter decreases the overall Q-factor of the\ncavity, it also enables simple observation of the intensity pattern which evolves in the\ndevice [15]. Figure 1 depicts SEM micrographs of some of the fabricated devices. The\nspecific parameters of each structure are detailed in the figure caption.\nThe near-field (NF) intensity pattern and the emitted spectrum of the ABRs were\nexamined at room temperature under pulsed optical pumping. The pump beam was\nfocused through the transparent sapphire substrate on the backside of the sample. Half\nof the pump beam intensity was split by a 3dB beam-splitter and was focused on a\ndetector to obtain the pump power. The vertical emission from the front side of the\nsample was wither focused on an IR camera to obtain the NF intensity pattern or\ncoupled into a multi-mode fiber to obtain the spectrum.\nThe spectrum emitted from the pumped, unpatterned, QW layer structure consisted of\na wide peak centered at 1559nm. When an ABR was pumped, the emission\ncharacteristics changed significantly. While the specific details varied from device to\ndevice, the overall behavior was similar. Once a certain pump intensity threshold was\nexceeded, clear and narrow emission lines appeared in the spectrum (see Fig. 2). As\nthe pump intensity was increased, the intensity of the emission lines increased while\nbroadening towards shorter wavelengths. Increasing the pump power further resulted\nin the appearance of additional emission lines.\n\n\fFigure 2 depicts the emitted spectra from an ABR for various pumping levels. The\nspecific device consisted of a half-wavelength wide defect surrounded by five and ten\nreflection gratings periods in the inner and outer sides respectively. The inset of Fig. 2\nshows an L-L curve of the same device, indicating a threshold at Pth=1.0mW. Other\ndevices exhibited even lower threshold levels, the lowest being 0.6mW.\nAt threshold, emission lines spaced approximately 14nm apart appeared in the\nspectrum. At twice the threshold level, two additional emission lines appeared at\n\u03bb=1.608\u03bcm and \u03bb=1.623\u03bcm. At Ppump=2.4mW three additional emission lines\nappeared at \u03bb=1.593\u03bcm, \u03bb=1.612\u03bcm and \u03bb=1.626\u03bcm. Increasing the pump even\nfurther resulted only in variation of relative intensities of the emitted modes.\nIn order to understand the spectral characteristics, a finite difference time domain\n(FDTD) simulation tool was used to model the device [16]. Figure 3 shows a\ncomparison between the measured (A) and the calculated (B) spectra. Good\nagreement was found between the measured and calculated spectra not only for the\nresonance wavelength but also for the relative amplitudes. It should be noted that the\nmeasured spectrum is to some extent \"compressed\" compared to the calculated one.\nThis is because the FDTD model does not account for the material dispersion of the\nmembrane. The field profiles of the various modes, can be classified into three\ndistinct categories (see Fig. 3A). The modes belonging to class D are confined within\nthe defect with different angular propagation coefficients. The modes belonging to\nclass I are confined in the ring closest to the defect from the internal side. These\nmodes are actually guided by TIR and are supported by the structure because of the\nuse of second order high-index layers. The rest of the modes, labeled by M are not\nlocalized in a specific layer but are distributed over several grating periods, peaking\nboth in the defect and in one of the rings of the internal reflector. Unlike the I class,\nthe M family modes are confined by Bragg reflection. The angular propagation\nfactors of M1 and M2 are 41 and 31 respectively, corresponding to effective indices of\n1.48 and 1.12, defined by neff = m\u03bb 2\u03c0\u03c1 eff where \u03bb and \u03c1 eff are respectively the\nresonance wavelength and the effective radius of the modes. These effective indices\nare lower than the refractive index of the adhesive filling the gaps, which confirms\nthat the radial confinement mechanism is indeed Bragg reflection.\nFigure 4 shows the intensity pattern emitted from the device at a pump level of\n1.6mW. The emitted pattern consisted of two concentric and relatively wide rings of\n\n\flight. The radius of the outer ring corresponds to the radius of the defect, indicating\nthat the lasing pattern belongs to the M family.\nIn summary, we demonstrated annular Bragg lasers realized in a thin membrane of\nInGaAsP active semiconductor material. Lasing was achieved at room temperature\nunder pulsed optical pumping conditions. Sub mW threshold levels were observed for\nABRs with 7-8\u03bcm defect radii pumped by a 30\u03bcm diameter spot. Imaging the vertical\nIR emission from the devices indicated localization of the field within the defect.\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Axel Scherer and Dr. Oskar Painter for\nfabrication facilities access and George Paloczi and Dr. Reginald Lee for fruitful\ndiscussions.
