We show empirically that\nin the three dimensional space of these angles, spanning 180\u25e6 \u00d7 180\u25e6 \u00d7 90\u25e6 , quads from\nsimple two-fold symmetric lenses of arbitrary radial density profile and arbitrary radially\ndependent ellipticity or external shear define a nearly invariant two dimensional surface.\nWe give a fitting formula for the surface using SIS+elliptical lensing potential. Various\ncircularly symmetric mass distributions with shear up to \u03b3 \u223c 0.4 deviate from it by\ntypically, rms \u223c 0.1\u25e6 , while elliptical mass distributions with ellipticity of up to e \u223c 0.4\ndeviate from it by rms \u223c 1.5\u25e6 . The existence of a near invariant surface gives a new\ninsight into the lensing theory and provides a framework for studying quads. It also\nallows one to gain information about the lens mass distribution from the image positions\nalone, without any recourse to mass modeling. As an illustration, we show that about\n3/4 of observed galaxy-lens quads do not belong to this surface within observational\nerror, and so require additional external shear or substructure to be modeled adequately.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecovering projected mass distribution of galaxies and clusters given the images of lensed\nbackground sources is an important problem, and much effort has been devoted to lens mass\nmodeling over the last couple of decades. In this paper we show that useful information about the\nlensing object can be obtained without any recourse to mass modeling. We work exclusively with\nquadruply imaged lens systems (the fifth central image is usually not detected and is not part of the\nanalysis), and more specifically, with the angular distribution of the four point-like images around\nthe lens center, that was introduced in Williams et al. (2008). We do not consider image fluxes.\nA typical quad image configuration is shown in Figure 1. The images are labeled by their\narrival time at the observer, 1 through 4. In most cases this ordering can be determined from\nthe morphology of the quad, without measured time delays (Saha & Williams 2003). Here we\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nare interested only in the mass distribution of the lens, not its total mass (or, equivalently, its\nnormalization), or orientation. In this case the image configuration of any quad is described uniquely\nby 6 parameters, which we chose to be of the polar variety, measured with respect to the lens center:\nthree relative angles, and three distance ratios of images. The three relative angles between images\nare marked on the plot, \u03b812 , \u03b834 and \u03b823 . Angle \u03b812 is between the two minima of the arrival time\nsurface, while \u03b834 is the angle between the saddle points. We define \u03b812 such that it encloses image\n3, and \u03b834 such that it encloses image 2. Of the three angles, \u03b823 is special because the separation\nbetween images 2 and 3 gets arbitrarily small for sources approaching the diamond caustic shown in\nthe lower right panels of Figure 1; when the source crosses the caustic these two images disappear\nand the quad becomes a double. Note that any linearly independent combination of the above three\nangles can be used, but we chose \u03b812 , \u03b834 and \u03b823 because they have a simple physical meaning.\nWorking with only two angles, \u03b823 and a certain linear combination of \u03b812 and \u03b834 , Williams et\nal. (2008) showed that a wide range of simple, twofold symmetric lens models generate apparently\nindistinguishable patterns in the two dimensional plane of these angles. Twofold symmetric means\nthat the mass distribution, and hence the potential, is symmetric about two orthogonal axes,\nand 'simple' excludes lenses with 'wavy' isodensity shapes. The simple, twofold symmetric class of\nlenses includes all popular parametric lens models, such as Singular Isothermal Ellipsoids (SIE), and\nSingular Isothermal Elliptical Potential (SIEP), as well lenses of any density profile and ellipticity.\nThe present paper is an extension of Williams et al. (2008), but here we work with the full\nset of three angles, \u03b812 , \u03b834 and \u03b823 . We show that quads from all simple lens mass distributions\nwith twofold symmetry lie on nearly the same two dimensional surface in the three dimensional\nspace of relative angles. We call this the Fundamental Surface of Quads (FSQ). The quads from\nobserved galaxy lenses, on the other hand, show a different behavior. As we show in Section 5,\ngalaxy quads form a 'cloud' surrounding the FSQ, with typical separations from the FSQ of few to\nseveral degrees.\nOne can draw some interesting parallels between the FSQ we introduce here and the well\nstudied Fundamental Plane of Ellipticals. Both lie in the three dimensional space whose axes are\nparameters describing the structural properties of the respective objects. In the case of quad lenses,\nthese are the relative image angles, while in the case of ellipticals they are the effective radius, the\nsurface brightness at the effective radius, and the central velocity dispersion. A wide class of objects\nbelong to the Surface and the Plane with small scatter. In other words, the objects do not fill the\nfull three dimensional space, implying that there is a tight relation between the three parameters.\nThe existence of the Fundamental Plane is basically the consequence of the virial theorem, while\nthe reason for the near invariance of the Fundamental Surface of Quads for a wide class of twofold\nsymmetric lenses (but not necessarily for the observed quads) is yet to be identified.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nThe SIS+elliptical lensing model\n\nWe start by studying a simple, analytically tractable, two dimensional projected gravitational\npotential. It belongs to the generic family of separable potentials, \u03c6(r, \u03b8) = r*f (\u03b8), where r and \u03b8\nare polar coordinates in the lens plane. Properties of such potentials are discussed in Kassiola &\nKovner (1993), Kochanek (1991) and Dalal (1998). For our purpose we choose\nf (\u03b8) = b[1 + \u03b3 cos(2\u03b8)]\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c6 = rb[1 + \u03b3 cos(2\u03b8)]\n\n(2)\n\nhence,\nwhich is sometimes called SIS+elliptical; we will call it SISell for short. The normalization factor\nb is the Einstein radius, and \u03b3 is the shear parameter.\nThe Poisson equation, \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03ba, yields the projected dimensionless mass density profile,\n\u03ba=\n\nb\n[1 \u2212 3\u03b3 cos(2\u03b8)].\n2r\n\n(3)\n\nNote that \u03b3 cannot be greater than 1/3 since otherwise \u03ba will have an unphysical negative value.\nThe lens equation,\n~\u03c6\nr~s = ~r \u2212 O\n(4)\nwhere r~s and ~r are source and image positions respectively, can be rewritten as two independent\nequations\nrs cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s ) = r \u2212 b[1 + \u03b3 cos(2\u03b8)]\n(5)\nrs\n.\n(6)\nrs sin(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s ) = \u22122b\u03b3 sin(2\u03b8) \u21d2 \u2212a sin(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8s ) = sin(2\u03b8), a =\n2b\u03b3\nSetting the magnification M = 1/ det(A) , where A is the Jacobian matrix of the lens equation,\nto infinity, i.e. det(A) = 0, one gets\ndet(A) =\n\n1\n[(r \u2212 b{1 + \u03b3 cos(2\u03b8)}) + 4b\u03b3 cos (2\u03b8)] = 0,\nr\n\n(7)\n\nwhich yields the condition for the caustic,\nr = b \u2212 3b\u03b3 cos(2\u03b8).\n\n(8)\n\nNow using equation (8) in the lens equation, eq. 6, allows one to express the caustic coordinates\n(rsc , \u03b8sc ) in the source plane as a function of parameter \u03b8,\np\nrsc = b\u03b3 2[5 + 3 cos(4\u03b8)]\n(9)\n\u0001\n\u22121\n3\n\u03b8sc = \u2212 tan\ntan \u03b8 .\n(10)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nOur aim is to calculate the three relative angles, \u03b812 , \u03b834 and \u03b823 for all the quads within\nthe diamond caustic.

Instead, we numerically generate random source positions within the caustic,\ncalculate \u03b8i 's using the above equations, and then compute relative angles.\nThe symmetry of the potential implies that it is sufficient to consider source positions only\nwithin one of the quadrants of the elliptical potential. Therefore, without any loss of generality we\nalign the x-axis with the major axis of the ellipse and consider \u03b8s only from 0 to \u03c0/2. For a given\n\u03b8hs , rs can vary in the range\n[0,rsc ), therefore with eqs. 6 and 9 we see that a runs in the range of\n\u0011\np\n0, 0.5 2[5 + 3 cos(4\u03b8)] , which is independent of b and \u03b3, where the parameter \u03b8 is determined\nby the value of \u03b8s using eq. 10.\n\n3.\n\nThe Fundamental Surface of Quads\n\nWe use the expressions for \u03b8i 's given in the previous Section to parametrically plot the relative\nquad angles in the three dimensional space of \u03b812 , \u03b834 and \u03b823 . The resulting distribution is a two\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndimensional surface, shown in Figure 2(a). The fact that it is a surface means that in a quad\nresulting from a SISell lens, two relative image angles completely determine the third.\nThe surface is simple with distinct properties. It has a slightly curved triangular shape with\nits apex at (\u03b812 , \u03b834 , \u03b823 ) = (180\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 ); quads at the apex have a \"cross\" configuration. The\ntwo edges connecting the apex to the base at \u03b823 = 0\u25e6 correspond to \u03b812 = 180\u25e6 and \u03b834 = 180\u25e6 ,\nbecause in a twofold symmetric lens the latter two angles do not exceed 180\u25e6 . Note that the base of\nthe triangular surface that represents small values of \u03b823 and source positions close to the caustic,\nshows some unevenness, or jaggedness. It is unclear whether this is intrinsic to \u03b8i equations, or if\nit is due to the numerical noise arising from the implementation of these equations. In all what\nfollows we ignore these small features; in particular, our fit to the surface, discussed below, smooths\nover this unevenness.\nThis surface is universal for all SISell lenses, however the meaning of universality requires\nsome clarification. For a given source position (\u03b8s , rs ), a relative angle \u03b8ij depends on b and \u03b3, and\ntherefore two SISell models with different b and \u03b3 give rise to two different points on the surface.\nHowever, the surface itself does not depend on b and \u03b3. This is the result of the elimination of b\nand \u03b3 dependence when considering all source positions within the caustic as discussed in Section\n2. Therefore quads from SISell models of all shears and normalizations lie on the same invariant\nsurface.\nWe would like to have an explicit functional form for the surface, as \u03b823 = fcn(\u03b812 , \u03b834 ), but\nsince the equations for individual angles, eq. 11-14, contain inverse cosines and are complicated,\nthere is no simple expression. Instead, we calculate thousands of sets of relative angles, (\u03b812 , \u03b834 ,\n\u03b823 ), from the expressions for the \u03b8i 's (eq. 11-14) and fit these with a surface represented by a\npolynomial function in \u03b812 and \u03b834 . The fitting was done using Matlab's Least Absolute Errors\n(LAE) method. As compared to the Least Squares method, LAE is less stable and could generate\nmore than one function. We chose LAE anyway because it is resistant to outliers, which in our case\ncorrespond to quads with small values of \u03b823 , and are responsible for the jaggedness of the surface.\nWe determine the optimal order of the polynomial by considering the deviations, or errors, of\nthe SISell quad points from the fit surface, quantified by the root mean square error, RMSE. A\nnumber of trials and tests revealed that a fourth order polynomial1 has the lowest value of RMSE,\n\u2248 0.00032 radians, or \u2248 0.018\u25e6 , for approximately 160 thousand quads. We note that using different\nsets of quads to obtain the fit equation resulted in slightly different values for the coefficients of the\npolynomial, and for some sets of quads the RMSE varied by up to a factor of two.\nTo test the robustness of our fit to changes in the fitting method, we also computed the best\nfit surface using the Least Square method2 , and using custom versus in-build polynomials within\n1\n2\n\nMatlab allows up to 5th degree polynomial fit.\n\nNumerical Recipes' Singular Value Decomposition routine did not provide a good fit when single precision was\nused, while in double precision svdcmp failed to invert the matrix at all.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nMatlab. Again, the resulting fit surface changed somewhat, but did not deviate substantially from\nthe fit we present below. We conclude, therefore, that although the fit equation is not reproducible\nexactly, it is completely adequate for our purposes:\n2\n3\n4\n\u03b823 = \u22125.792 + 1.783 \u03b812 + 0.1648 \u03b812\n\u2212 0.04591 \u03b812\n\u2212 0.0001486 \u03b812\n+ 1.784 \u03b834\n2\n3\n2\n2\n\u22120.7275 \u03b834 \u03b812 + 0.0549 \u03b834 \u03b812\n+ 0.01487 \u03b834 \u03b812\n+ 0.1643 \u03b834\n+ 0.05493 \u03b834\n\u03b812 (18)\n2 2\n3\n3\n4\n\u22120.03429 \u03b834\n\u03b812 \u2212 0.04579 \u03b834\n+ 0.01487 \u03b834\n\u03b812 \u2212 0.0001593 \u03b834\n\nFigure 2(b) shows the fit as the gray semi-transparent surface. The red points are SISell quads\ncorresponding to a random distribution of source positions within the diamond caustic, on the\nsource plane. As depicted in the Figure, a random distribution of source positions does not imply a\nrandom distribution of quads on the Fundamental Surface; quad density increases with increasing\n\u03b823 . Two other orientations of the Fundamental Surface are shown in Figure 3.\n\u25e6\nBecause the RMSE of the SISell quad distribution about the fit plane is <\n\u223c 0.02 the differences\nbetween the two will be invisible in the full three dimensional angles space. Instead, we calculate\nthe difference in \u03b823 of the SISell quads and the fitted surface keeping the other two angles fixed; we\ncall this difference \u2206\u03b823 = \u03b823 \u2212 \u03b823,f it , where \u03b823,f it is obtained by plugging \u03b812 and \u03b834 of a quad\nin to eq. 18. Figure 4 plots \u2206\u03b823 vs. \u03b823 . The straight horizontal line represents the surface fit,\neq. 18, while the points are the SISell quads. The wiggles in the distribution of points represents the\nwiggles in the SISell surface, compared to the fourth order polynomial fit. However, for all practical\npurposes, the differences are negligible, and eq. 18 can be taken to be a good representation of the\nSISell potential.\n\nWe call this surface the Fundamental Surface of Quads because, as we show in the next section,\nnot just SISell, but most twofold symmetric models do not differ from it by more than a few degrees.\nThis near invariance probably stems from the shape of the caustic of this class of potentials. The\ntwofold symmetry of the lensing mass distribution implies the twofold symmetry of the diamond\ncaustic. More specifically the diagonals of the caustic intersect at 90\u25e6 and all four quadrants of the\ncaustic are identical.\n\n4.\n\nOther two-fold symmetric potentials\n\nIn this Section we explore a wider range of simple twofold symmetric mass models, motivated\nby the commonly used parametric models. We calculate typical values for a total of 12 models, but\nshow plots (see below) for only eight of these.\nTwo of the first four models have isothermal (SIS) radial density profiles, and the other two,\nde Vaucouleurs (deV) profile. Isothermal means that if mass ellipticity were zero, the projected\ndensity profile would scale as 1/r. The de Vaucouleurs profile has projected density given by,\n\u0010\nh\ni\u0011\n\u03a3 = \u03a3e exp \u22127.673 (r/re )1/4 \u2212 1 ,\n(19)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhere re is the half-mass radius, and \u03a3e is the projected mass density at re . To generate a\ndiamond caustic the density profiles must be accompanied by either ellipticity, e, or external shear,\n\u03b3. Ellipticity, e of the mass isodensity contours is related to the axis ratio of the isodensity contours,\nb/a = (1 \u2212 e)/(1 + e). The properties of the first four models are: SIS with e = 0 and \u03b3 = 0.3; deV\nwith e = 0 and \u03b3 = 0.4; SIE with e = 0.3 and \u03b3 = 0; deV with e = 0.4 and \u03b3 = 0.\nThe additional eight models explore a range of power-law surface mass density profiles, \u03a3(R) \u221d\nR\u2212\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = 0.4, 0.7, 1.3, 1.6, where isothermal slope is \u03b1 = 1. The range of slopes we have chosen\nis considerably wider than what real lensing galaxies seem to have. Based on a well defined sample\nof 15 elliptical galaxy lenses, Koopmans et al. (2006) find that the typical total (dark matter and\nbaryons) space density slope is 2.01, or about 1 is projection, with dispersion of 0.12. We chose\na range of slopes 5 times wider than that because we would like to demonstrate the robustness of\nthe FSQ to changes in the lens model parameters. Each of these four density profile slope models\nwere given e = 0.25, or \u03b3 = 0.25. These values are somewhat on the high side of the typical values\nfor ellipticity and shear encountered in modeling observed quads.\nEach mass model generates a two dimensional surface in the three dimensional space of relative\nangles. All surfaces coincide at the apex, where (\u03b812 , \u03b834 , \u03b823 ) = (180\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 ), since all twofold\nsymmetric models can produce a perfect cross configuration (though the distance ratios of images\nwill differ). At other locations the surfaces deviate from each other somewhat, and from the\none defined by SISell; largest deviations are seen at small \u03b823 values, i.e. towards the base of\nthe triangular surface. However, even at the widest separation, the surfaces differ by only a few\ndegrees. The left panel of Figure 5 shows that these differences are hard to discern in the full three\ndimensional angles space, even if the surface is split up into four pieces for easier visualization. To\nmake the deviations visible, in the right panel of Figure 5 we fold the surface along the vertical\nmid-line, and show only a narrow range of angles, a few degrees in each case. In this zoom, the\ndeviations are seen to be a few degrees.\nAnother way to show deviations is to use \u2206\u03b823 introduced in the previous Section; see Figures 6\nand 7. As before the horizontal line at \u2206\u03b823 = 0 represents the Fundamental Surface of Quads,\ngiven by the fit eq. 18, and the points are quads from lens mass models. In Figure 6 the isothermal\nmodels and the de Vaucouleurs models are shown in the left and right panels, respectively. The\ntop row shows the models with external shear, \u03b3, while the bottom rows represent elliptical mass\ndistributions. In Figure 7 four mass models with power-law density profiles are shown.\nTo quantify the effect of shear or ellipticity on any given mass model, we quote the average\ndistance ratio < d4 /d1 >, where d1 and d4 are the distances of the first and fourth arriving images\nfrom the lens center, and the average is over quads randomly populating the inside of the diamond\ncaustic. A given lens mass distribution produces quads with a range of image distance ratios, but\nin general image 1 tends to be farthest from the lens center, while image 4 tends to be closest. For\nthe 12 models, < d4 /d1 > is between 0.5 and 0.9. For the sample of 40 observed quads (Section 5)\n< d4 /d1 >\u223c 0.68. i.e. typically smaller than in our models. As will be discussed in the next\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nSection many of the observed quads are the result of mass distributions that are more involved\nthan two-fold symmetric lenses; most require an external shear in addition to and elliptical lens,\nwhile some require substructure. The presence of these would tend to reduce the d4 /d1 ratio.\nTable 1 summarizes the results of the 12 models. In general, larger ellipticities or larger\n\u03b3 result in larger deviations from the FSQ. Because the maximum deviations from FSQ differ\nbetween models from a fraction of a degree to a few degrees, the range on the vertical axes range\nare different in the top and bottom panels of Figures 6 and 7. As opposed to the quad distributions\ngenerated by the elliptical mass models, the ones from models with external shear are much closer\nto the FSQ, and appear more similar to that of the SISell model (unless the surface mass density is\nvery shallow, as in the bottom right panel of Figure 7). When viewed in 3D, the surfaces containing\nquads from the elliptical lens models sag below the FSQ, but even for the bottom right panel of\nFigure 6 the deviations in \u03b823 are < 4\u25e6 , for e = 0.4, and de Vaucoulers profile. Here the images\nare formed where the projected density \u03a3(R) \u221d R\u22122 , or \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22123 in three dimensions. Given\nobserved lenses, this is a rather extreme combination of ellipticity and \u03a3(R). Ellipticity of e = 0.4\ncorresponds to the axis ratio b/a = 0.43, or an E5.7 if it were an optical elliptical galaxy. Steep\ndensity profiles also appear to result in larger deviations from the FSQ; see Table 1. Real galaxy\nlenses rarely, if at all, have such steep profiles at the location of quad images. For e = 0.25, and\n\u03a3(R) \u221d R\u22120.4...\u22121.6 (top right and bottom left panels of Figure 7), the deviations from FSQ are a\ndegree at most.\nWe note that for very large ellipticities or shears (not considered here) the two opposite cusps of\nthe diamond caustic protrude outside of the oval caustic producing so-called naked cusps, which do\nnot produce quads. The corresponding surfaces of relative angles look similar to the ones without\nthe naked cusps, except that the portions at the bottom corners of the surface are devoid of quads.\n\n5.\n\nObserved Quads\n\nIn this Section we illustrate one of the practical uses of the Fundamental Surface of Quads\n(FSQ).\nGalaxy lens systems can be approximately divided into three categories, depending on whether\nthe lens mass model is (a) an elliptical mass distribution or a circularly symmetric mass distribution\nwith an external shear, (b) an elliptical mass distribution plus some external shear, or (c) a more\ncomplicated mass distribution, possibly with additional lens galaxies or substructure mass clumps.\nA survey of the literature indicates that only a handful of systems belong to (a). A model-free way\nto come to that conclusion is to look at the quads in the 3D angles space.\nWe have assembled a sample of 40 galaxy-lens quads. The sample was collected from all\navailable sources, and is therefore heterogeneous. Where possible, the astrometry, including the\npositional uncertainties on the images and the lensing galaxy was taken from the CASTLeS website (Kochanek et al. 2008); otherwise from individual papers. In the latter case, systems listed in\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nTable 2 have a footnote with a reference; a lens system with no reference means that its data were\nobtained entirely from CASTLeS. The image arrival time was determined from the morphology\nof the lens (Saha & Williams 2003), and the relative angles were calculated. These are listed in\nTable 2, in columns labeled \u03b812 , \u03b834 and \u03b823 .\nIn Figure 8 we show two orientations of the 3D angles space with the FSQ and the 40 quads.\nFor clarity, we do not show errors in this plot. The main conclusion is that most observed quads\nlie more than a few degrees away from the FSQ; 12 are within \u00b12\u25e6 , so most cannot be modeled\nadequately with an elliptical lens, or a circularly symmetric lenses with external shear.\nNext, we incorporate errors into the analysis. Even though the astrometric measurement errors\nof images and galaxy lens center are largely independent of each other, a shift in the lens center\ntranslates into correlated relative angle errors. To account for this we calculate the errors as follows.\nWe assume that the x, y positional errors of each of the four images and the lens center are normally\ndistributed, with \u03c3x and \u03c3y taken from the literature. We then draw thousands of independent\nimage and lens center positions, and for each generated lens system calculate relative angles \u03b812 ,\n\u03b834 and \u03b823 . The thousands of generated quads per lens system then give us the error distribution\nfor each of the three relative angles. We calculate the mean and the rms of these distributions, and\nlist them in columns labeled \u03b8ij,errors in Table 2. Note that the average of these distributions need\nnot be the same as \u03b8ij , however, the differences tend to be small, generally < 0.1\u25e6 .\nWe quantify the deviation of the quads from the FSQ as in earlier Sections, by calculating\n\u2206\u03b823 . The error in \u2206\u03b823 , listed as \u2206\u03b823,errors is calculated similarly to what was described above,\nusing thousands of quads generated based on astrometric uncertainty.\nFigure 9 shows the distribution of the 40 quads in the \u03b823 vs. \u2206\u03b823 plane. Within errorbars,\nonly 10 systems are consistent with FSQ. Several of these have published parametric modeling, and\nare, in fact, well represented by two-fold symmetric mass distributions. For example, B2045+265\nis successfully modeled by Fassnacht et al. (1999) using SISell potential, eq. 2. SDSS J002240 is\nmodeled by Allam et al. (2007) with Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) using gravlens software\nof Keeton (2001). The same software was used by Grillo et al. (2010) to fit the positions (not the\nflux ratios) of SDSS J1538 with three types of twofold symmetric models: de Vaucoulers, SIE and\na power law density profile.\nOn the other hand, some of the lenses which lie away from the FSQ are known to require\nexternal shear in addition to elliptical lens. PG 1115 where the lensing galaxy is a member of a\ngalaxy group is inconsistent with FSQ; its |\u2206\u03b823 | \u223c 4\u25e6 . RXJ 0911+0551 has a cluster next to it\n(Burud et al. 1998), so the lens model requires an external shear in addition to an elliptical galaxy\nlens; its |\u2206\u03b823 | \u223c 6\u25e6 . For LSD Q0047-2808, Koopmans & Treu (2003) state that SIE+shear does\nnot fit the image positions well (but sufficient for the determination of the Einstein ring radius);\nit has |\u2206\u03b823 | \u223c 14\u25e6 . Lenses with known secondary galaxies also lie far from the FSQ. HE 02302130 has a secondary lensing galaxy (Wisotzki et al. 1999) very close to the images, and so its\n|\u2206\u03b823 | \u223c 30\u25e6 . B1608 has a complicated galaxy merger as a lens, and its |\u2206\u03b823 | \u223c 5\u25e6 , and so it is\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ninconsistent with the FSQ.\nA few caveats are in order. If a quad does not lie within a couple of degrees of the Fundamental\nSurface of Quads (i.e. the range defined by the various density profile and ellipticity models, such\nas the ones in Figure 5, 6 and 7), it cannot be modeled by a twofold symmetric lens. However,\nthe opposite need not be true. If a quad lies on the FSQ does that immediately imply that it can\nbe modeled by a twofold symmetric lens, regardless of its image distance ratios? This question\nwill be addressed in a future study. We also note that even if a quad does belong to the locus of\ntwofold symmetric lens in the full 6D space of image position properties, it does not mean that\nother types of lens models cannot fit it. Reconstruction of the lens mass reconstruction from single\nquads is a highly underconstrained problem, so the solution is not unique, and many mass models\ncan reproduce the image positions exactly (Saha & Williams 2004).\n\n6.\n\nConclusions and Future Work\n\nIn this paper we present a model-free way of making inferences about the lensing mass distribution given its quad image positions. The latter are represented by three relative angles that\ndescribe the distribution of images around the lens center. We show that in the three dimensional\nspace of these angles, quads generated by SIS+elliptical mass distribution belong to an invariant\ntwo dimensional surface, regardless of the shear parameter \u03b3, and normalization b. Furthermore,\nquads from a wider class of lenses with twofold symmetry outline almost the same surface, making\nthe surface a near invariant descriptor of twofold symmetric mass distributions. Because of that\nproperty we call the two dimensional surface the Fundamental Surface of Quads (FSQ).\nThe existence of FSQ allows one to characterize galaxies and clusters based on the quads they\ngenerate. To aid in that, we provide a fitting formula for the FSQ based on the SIS+elliptical\nlensing potential. If a quad does not lie within a couple of degrees of the FSQ (i.e. the range\ndefined by the various density profile and ellipticity models, such as the ones in Figure 5, 6, and\n7), the mass distribution is not twofold symmetric. This method of determining if a lens can be\nfit with a twofold symmetric lens is superior to answering this question using parametric modeling.\nThe latter fits quads with a finite set of models, while our method addresses all twofold symmetric\nmodels irrespective of the specific parametric form.\nHowever, the main importance of the FSQ is not in ascertaining if the lens mass distribution is\ntwofold symmetric or not, but in the following aspects, which we will investigate in the forthcoming\npapers. First, the near invariance of FSQ provides a new framework for studying quads, and strong\nlensing theory in general. We remind the reader that it is still not understood why a wide class\nof twofold symmetric lenses form such a tight, near invariant distribution in the space of relative\nangles. Second, as already shown in Williams et al. (2008), the relative angles present a promising\nway of investigating realistic mass distributions, and specifically, differentiating substructured lenses\nfrom smooth non-twofold symmetric ones. Finally, the full set of quad image properties lives in the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nsix dimensional space that includes image distance ratios. An investigation of this space is yet to\nbe undertaken.\n\nREFERENCES\nAllam, S. S., Tucker, D. L., Lin, H., Diehl, H. T., Annis, J., Buckley-Geer, E. J., Frieman, J.

For the first four the slope of\nthe projected surface mass density, \u03a3(R), at the location of the images is indicated in parentheses. For de Vaucouleurs models\nthe slope of the density profile changes with radius, so the value of the slope is a typical value for the radii where the images\nform. The other eight density profiles are power-laws in radius. The quantity < d4 /d1 > is the average ratio of the distance of\nthe 4th and 1st arriving images. In the third column, rms (0\u25e6\u221290\u25e6 ) is the rms value of \u2206\u03b823 for all the images, i.e. those with\nthe full range of \u03b823 , or 0\u25e6\u221290\u25e6 . The last three columns show rms values for three subsets of images, divided by their \u03b823\nvalues. All rms are quoted in degrees.\n\n< d4 /d1 >\n\nLens Mass Model\n\nTable 1.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fLens name\n\nMG 2016+112\nB 0712+472\nB 2045+265\nB 1933+503 lobe\nSLACS J2300+002\nMG
