Unlike in other active galaxies, the intensely star-forming regions in NGC 1068 and the CND can\nbe resolved with current instrumentation. This makes this galaxy an optimal test-bed to probe the effects of AGN on the molecular\nmedium at \u223c 100 pc scales.\nAims: Single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of silicon monoxide (SiO) in the CND of NGC 1068 is\nenhanced by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude with respect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in the Galaxy. We aim\nat unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the SiO enhancement.\nMethods: We have imaged with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) the emission of the SiO(2\u20131) (86.8 GHz) and CN(2\u2013\n1) (226.8 GHz) lines in NGC 1068 at \u223c 150 pc and 60 pc spatial resolution, respectively. We have also obtained complementary IRAM\n30m observations of HNCO and methanol (CH3 OH) lines. These species are known as tracers of shocks in the Galaxy.\nResults: SiO is detected in a disk of \u223c400pc size around the AGN. SiO abundances in the CND of \u223c(1\u20135)\u00d710\u22129 are about 1\u20132 orders\nof magnitude above those measured in the starburst ring. The overall abundance of CN in the CND is high: \u223c(0.2\u20131)\u00d710\u22127 . The\nabundances of SiO and CN are enhanced at the extreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the AGN\n(r <70 pc). On average, HNCO/SiO and CH3 OH/SiO line ratios in the CND are similar to those measured in prototypical shocked\nregions in our Galaxy. However, the strength and abundance of CN in NGC 1068 can be explained neither by shocks nor by PDR\nchemistry. Abundances measured for CN and SiO, and the correlation of CN/CO and SiO/CO ratios with hard X-ray irradiation,\nsuggest that the CND of NGC 1068 has become a giant X-ray dominated region (XDR).\nConclusions: The extreme properties of molecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of NGC 1068 result from the interplay\nbetween different processes directly linked to nuclear activity. Results presented in this paper highlight, in particular, the footprint of\nshocks and X-ray irradiation on the properties of molecular gas in this Seyfert. Whereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation\nfor CN and SiO in NGC 1068, the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. The inclusion of dust grain chemistry would help\nsolve the controversy regarding the abundances of other molecular species, like HCN, which are under-predicted by XDR models.\nKey words.

IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG\n(Germany) and IGN (Spain)\n\nstrong radiation fields (UV and X-rays) and the injection of mechanical energy (by gas outflows or jet-ISM interactions) are key\ningredients in the feedback of activity. Molecular line observations can be used to study the nature of the dominant source of\nenergy in galaxies hosting both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nintense star formation . Furthermore, nearby galaxies can serve\nas local templates of distant galaxies where these phenomena\ncan be deeply embedded.\n1\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nSome of the tracers of the dense molecular gas phase, which\nare commonly used in extragalactic research, can be heavily affected by the feedback of AGN activity. In particular the lines of\nHCN (the most widely observed tracer of the dense molecular\nmedium) appear as over-luminous in the CND of many Seyfert\ngalaxies with respect to other tracers of the dense molecular gas\n(Tacconi et al. 1994; Kohno et al. 2001; Usero et al. 2004, hereafter U04; Krips et al. 2008). Doubts have been thus cast on\nthe universality of the conversion factor between the luminosity\nof the HCN(1\u20130) line, LHCN(1\u22120) , and the mass of dense molecular gas in active galaxies (Graci\u00e1-Carpio et al. 2006, 2008;\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2006; Krips et al. 2008). X-rays can efficiently process large column densities of molecular gas around\nAGNs, producing X-ray dominated regions (XDR). It has been\nproposed that the abundances of certain ions, radicals and molecular species, like HCN, can be enhanced in XDR (Lepp &\nDalgarno 1996; Maloney et al. 1996; Meijerink & Spaans 2005;\nMeijerink et al. 2007). However, it is still controversial whether\npure gas-phase XDR models are able to enhance HCN abundances in AGN to the level imposed by observations.\nThe inclusion of dust grain chemistry, not taken into account by gas-phase XDR schemes, could solve the HCN controversy in AGN by enhancing the abundance of this molecule.\nBesides HCN, other molecular species can also undergo significant changes in their abundances due to dust grain processing.\nX-rays can evaporate small (\u223c10 \u00c5) silicate grains (Voit 1991).\nThis can increase the Si fraction in the gas phase and then\nconsiderably enhance the abundance of SiO in X-ray irradiated\nmolecular gas (Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado et al. 2000; U04; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo\net al. 2008; Amo-Baladr\u00f3n et al. 2009). Furthermore, mechanical sputtering of dust grains in molecular shocks is an additional source of dust grain chemistry. Large SiO abundances\nhave been found in the nuclei of a number of non-AGN galaxies\nwhere interferometer maps have been key to identifying largescale molecular shocks (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2000, 2001; Usero\net al. 2006).\nTo address the role of X-rays and shocks in shaping the\nchemistry of molecular gas in AGN requires a multi-species approach. Unlike SiO, other tracers of the dense molecular gas,\nlike CN, are not expected to be highly abundant in shocks\n(Mitchell 1984; Fuente et al. 2005; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et\nal. 2010). However, there is a consensus supported by observations and theoretical models that the CN radical is a privileged tracer of highly ionized molecular gas, typical of photon or X-ray dominated regions (PDR or XDR) (Boger &\nSternberg 2005; Fuente et al. 1993, 2008; Janssen et al. 1995;\nLepp & Dalgarno 1996; Meijerink & Spaans 2005; Meijerink et\nal. 2007). Observations of tracers like SiO and CN can then be\nused to quantify the relevance of shocks and XDR chemistry in\nAGN. Furthermore the high-spatial resolution provided by interferometers is paramount to spatially discriminate between the\ndifferent chemical environments (star formation vs AGN activity) that can coexist in a single galaxy.\nNGC 1068 is the strongest nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy, and as\nsuch is a prime candidate for studying the feeding and the feedback of activity using molecular line observations. Tacconi et\nal. (1994) and Schinnerer et al. (2000; hereafter S00) used the\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) to map at high-resolution\n(1\u20134\u2032\u2032 ) the emission of molecular gas in the central r \u223c1.5-2 kpc\ndisk using HCN and CO lines. The CO maps spatially resolve\nthe distribution of molecular gas in the disk, showing a prominent starburst ring (hereafter SB ring) of \u223c1-1.5 kpc\u2013radius,\nwhich contributes significantly to the total CO luminosity of\nNGC 1068 (see also Planesas et al. 1991 and Baker 2000, here2\n\nafter B00). Furthermore, CO emission is detected in a central\nr \u223c200 pc CND surrounding the AGN. In contrast to CO, emission from the HCN(1\u20130) line, which is also spatially resolved in\nthe Tacconi et al.'s maps, arises mainly from the CND. Tacconi\net al. (1994) derived a high HCN/CO intensity ratio (\u223c1) in the\nCND. This is about a factor of 5\u201310 higher than the average ratio\nmeasured in the SB ring (Usero et al. in prep). Radiative transfer calculations based on multi-line observations of HCN and\nCO showed that the abundance of HCN relative to CO was significantly enhanced in the CND: HCN/CO\u223c10\u22123 (Sternberg et\nal. 1994).\nU04 used the IRAM 30m telescope to observe with low to\nmoderate spatial resolutions (\u223c10\u201330\u2032\u2032) the emission of eight\nmolecular species in the CND of NGC 1068. The global analysis of the survey, which includes several lines of SiO, CN, HCO,\nH13 CO+ , H12 CO+ , HOC+ , HCN, CS, and CO, indicated that the\nbulk of the molecular gas emission in the CND of NGC 1068\ncould be interpreted as coming from a giant XDR. More recently,\nP\u00e9rez-Beaupuits et al. (2007, 2009) analyzed new single-dish\ndata obtained for several rotational lines of HCO+ , HNC, CN\nand HCN, and came to similar conclusions as U04. However,\nthe low spatial resolution of these single-dish observations are\nnot optimal to precisely disentangle the contributions of the starburst and the CND in NGC 1068.\nIn this paper, we use the high-spatial resolution (\u223c1\u20133\u2032\u2032 ) afforded by PdBI to map the emission of the (v=0, J=2\u20131) line of\nSiO and the N=2\u20131 transition of CN in the central r \u223c1.5-2 kpc\ndisk of NGC 1068. The spatial resolution of the new observations, an order of magnitude higher than that of the 30m survey of U04, allow us to neatly separate the emission of the SB\nring from that of the CND. Furthermore, the SiO and CN PdBI\nmaps, together with complementary single-dish data obtained in\nCH3 OH and HNCO lines, are used to study the chemical differentiation inside the CND through an analysis of line ratio maps.\nLine ratios are interpreted with the help of one-phase large velocity gradient (LVG) models. While the emission of the different lines and species analyzed in this work likely comes from regions characterized by different physical conditions, the adopted\none-phase approach allows us to explore the existence of overall\ntrends in the chemical abundances of these species, using a minimum set of free parameters in the fit. We explore the dependence\nof line ratios with the illumination of molecular gas by the X-ray\nAGN source. We also explore the link between shock chemistry\nand gas kinematics in the CND.\nWe describe in Sect. 2 the observations, including highresolution SiO, CN and CO maps obtained with the PdBI, singledish data obtained with the 30m telescope as well as X-ray images taken by Chandra of NGC 1068. Sect. 3 presents the continuum maps derived at 86.8 GHz and 226.8 GHz. The distribution\nand kinematics of molecular gas derived from SiO and CN are\ndescribed in Sects. 4 and 5. SiO and CN abundances are discussed in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7 we interpret the line ratio maps in\nterms of two different chemical scenarios (shocks and XDR).\nThe main conclusions of this work are summarized in Sect. 8.\nWe assume a distance to NGC 1068 of D \u223c14 Mpc (BlandHawthorn et al.1997); this implies a spatial scale of \u223c70 pc/\u2032\u2032 .\n\n2. Observations\n2.1. Interferometric maps\n\nObservations of NGC 1068 were carried out with the PdBI\narray (Guilloteau et al. 1992) between December 2004 and\nFebruary 2005. We used the BC configurations and six anten-\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nnas in dual frequency mode. We simultaneously observed the\n(v=0, J=2\u20131) line of SiO (at 86.847 GHz) and the N=2\u20131 transition of CN. The CN(2\u20131) transition is split up into 18 hyperfine lines blended around three groups (J=5/2\u20133/2, J=3/2\u2013\n1/2 and J=3/2\u20133/2). We have observed the two strongest groups\nof lines at 226.9 GHz (J=5/2\u20133/2) and 226.7 GHz (J=3/2\u20131/2),\nhereafter referred to as high frequency (HF) and low frequency\n(LF) CN lines, respectively. During the observations the spectral correlator was split in two halves centered at 86.800 GHz\nand 226.767 GHz. This choice allowed us to cover the SiO\nline at 3 mm and the CN lines at 1 mm. The J=1\u20130 line\nof H13 CO+ (at 86.754 GHz) is simultaneously covered by the\n3 mm setup. Rest frequencies were corrected for the recession velocity initially assumed to be vo (HEL)=1137 km s\u22121 .\nThe correlator configuration covers a bandwidth of 580 MHz\nfor each setup, using four 160 MHz-wide units with an overlap of 20 MHz; this is equivalent to 2000 km s\u22121 (770 km s\u22121 ) at\n86.8 GHz (226.8 GHz). Observations were conducted in single\npointings of sizes 56\u2032\u2032 and 21\u2032\u2032 at 3 mm and 1 mm, respectively,\ncentered at \u03b12000 =02h 42m 40.71 s and \u03b42000 =\u201300\u25e6 00\u2032 47.94\u2032\u2032. The\nlatter corresponds to the nominal position of the AGN core,\nas determined from different VLA and VLBI radio continuum\nimages of the galaxy (e.g., Gallimore et al. 1996). Visibilities\nwere obtained using on-source integration times of 20 minutes\nframed by short (\u223c 2 min) phase and amplitude calibrations on\nthe nearby quasars 0235+164 and 0336-019. The absolute flux\nscale in our maps was derived to a 10% accuracy based on\nthe observations of primary calibrators whose fluxes were determined from a combined set of measurements obtained at the\n30m telescope and the PdBI array. The bandpass calibration was\ncarried out using NRAO150 and 1749+096 and is accurate to\nbetter than 5%.\nThe image reconstruction was done using standard\nIRAM/GILDAS software (Guilloteau & Lucas 2000). We used\nnatural weighting and no taper to generate the SiO line map\nwith a size of 64\u2032\u2032 and 0.25\u2032\u2032 /pixel sampling; the corresponding\nsynthesized beam is 3.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2.1\u2032\u2032 , PA=29\u25e6. We also used natural weighting to generate the CN map with a size of 32\u2032\u2032 and\n0.12\u2032\u2032 /pixel sampling; this enables us to achieve a spatial resolution of \u223c1\u2032\u2032 (1.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.8\u2032\u2032 , PA=19\u25e6). The conversion factors\nbetween Jy beam\u22121 and K are 22 K Jy\u22121 beam at 86.8 GHz, and\n21 K Jy\u22121 beam at 226.8 GHz. The point source sensitivities are\nderived from emission-free channels. They are 1.5 mJy beam\u22121\nin 2.5 MHz-wide channels at 3mm, and 7.6 mJy beam\u22121 in\n6.25 MHz-wide channels at 1mm. Images of the continuum\nemission of the galaxy have been obtained by averaging those\nchannels free of line emission at both frequency ranges. The corresponding point source sensitivities for continuum images are\n0.3 mJy beam\u22121 at 86.8 GHz and 0.7 mJy beam\u22121 at 226.8 GHz.\nIn this work we use the 1.8\u2032\u2032 resolution CO(1\u20130) interferometer maps of NGC 1068 obtained with the PdBI by S00. We\nlist in Table 1 the relevant parameters for the SiO and CN PdBI\nobservations presented in this paper.\n2.2. Single-dish spectra\n\nNew CH3 OH and HNCO observations of the nucleus of\nNGC 1068 were carried out in July 2006 with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope at Pico de Veleta (Spain). We observed the 2k \u20131k group\nof transitions of CH3 OH. This group is a blended set of four\nlines. Hereafter we consider the frequency of the 20 -10 A+ line\n(96.741 GHz) as velocity reference. We observed the higher frequency group of transitions of methanol at 2 mm (denoted as 3k \u2013\n2k ), a blended set of eight lines. The frequency of the 30 -20 A+\n\nFig. 1. The continuum maps obtained with the PdBI towards\nthe nucleus of NGC 1068 at 3 mm (grey scale contours: 3%,\n5%, 10%, 15%, 25% to 85% in steps of 15% of the maximum=39.8 mJy beam\u22121 ) and 1 mm (white contours: 20% to\n95% in steps of 15% of the maximum=14.2 mJy beam\u22121 ).\nThe lowest contours correspond to \u223c4\u03c3 levels at both frequencies. (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)\u2013offsets are relative to the phase tracking center\n(\u03b12000 =02h 42m 40.71 s, \u03b42000 =\u201300\u25e600\u2032 47.94\u2032\u2032), which coincides\nwith the position of the AGN (filled square). Black-filled and\nwhite-filled ellipses show the beams at 3 mm (3.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d72.1\u2032\u2032 at\nPA=29\u25e6) and 1 mm (1.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d70.8\u2032\u2032 at PA=19\u25e6 ), respectively.\nline (145.103 GHz) is taken as velocity reference. We also observed the 404 \u2013303 rotational transition of HNCO (hereafter designated as 4\u20133) at 87.925 GHz. The corresponding beam sizes of\nthe telescope are \u223c28\u2032\u2032 at 3 mm and 17\u2032\u2032 at 2 mm. The 3 mm and\n2 mm SIS receivers of the 30m telescope were tuned to the redshifted frequencies of the lines around vo (HEL)=1137 km s\u22121 .\nThe velocity range covered was 1600 km s\u22121 for the 3 mm lines\nand 900 km s\u22121 for the 2 mm lines. The wobbler switching mode\nwas used to obtain flat baselines with a maximum beam throw\nof 4\u2032 .\nTypical system temperatures during the observations were\n\u223c200 K at 3 mm and \u223c300 K at 2 mm. All receivers were used\nin single side-band mode (SSB), with a high rejection of the image band. The calibration accuracy is better than 20%. Pointing\nof the 30m telescope was regularly checked every 1.5 hours by\nobserving a nearby continuum source; we found an average rms\npointing error of 2\u20133\u2032\u2032 during the observations.\nThroughout the paper, line intensities are given in antenna\ntemperature scale, T a\u2217 . The T a\u2217 scale relates to the main beam\ntemperature scale, T mb , by the equation T mb = (Feff /Beff )T a\u2217 ,\nwhere Feff and Beff are, respectively, the forward and beam efficiencies of the telescope at a given frequency. For the IRAM\n30m telescope Feff /Beff = 1.26 (1.48) at 86 GHz (145 GHz).\n\n3. Continuum maps\nFigure 1 shows the continuum maps derived at 86.8 GHz and\n226.8 GHz in the nucleus of NGC 1068. The morphology of\nthe maps is similar to that described by Krips et al. (2006),\nwho observed the continuum emission at the nearby frequencies 110 GHz and 230.5 GHz. The emission consists of a central\ncomponent (AGN core), a NE elongation (jet), and a SW elonga3\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nTable 1.

The counter-jet and the jet are only detected\nat 3 mm.\nWe have used the GILDAS task UV-FIT to fit the continuum visibilities at both frequencies using a set of three point\nsources. Most of the flux comes from the compact source located at the position of the VLBI radio core at (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)\u223c(0\u2032\u2032 ,\n0\u2032\u2032 ). The AGN core has a flux of 39.8\u00b10.3 mJy and 16.0\u00b10.7 mJy\nat 86.8 GHz and 226.8 GHz, respectively. The NE jet component\nis fitted by a point source of 23.8\u00b10.3 mJy at 86.8 GHz, located\nat (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)=(2.6\u2032\u2032 , 3.4\u2032\u2032 ). The 3 mm counter-jet point source at\n(\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)=(\u20131.6\u2032\u2032, \u20134.0\u2032\u2032 ) has a flux of 4.7\u00b10.3 mJy. There are\nnevertheless hints of extended emission, mostly at 3 mm, not\nfully accounted for by the point source fitting (Krips et al. 2006).\nTaking into account the differences in frequency, spatial resolution and fitting functions used, the solution described above is\nin agreement with that found by Krips et al. (2006) (see their\nTable 1 for a detailed description).\n\ning sizes \u223cbeam and intensities at the 3\u20134\u03c3 level, are distributed\nalong the SB ring.\nThe overall distribution of SiO in the CND, spatially resolved by the PdBI beam, shows an east-west elongation. The\ndeconvolved full size of the emission at a 4\u03c3 level is \u223c400 pc\nalong the east-west axis. The CND is marginally resolved along\nthe north-south axis; the corresponding deconvolved size is\n\u2264150 pc. These sizes are comparable with those derived from the\nhigher resolution 1\u20130 and 2\u20131 CO maps of the CND published\nby S00, as well as with those derived from the CN(2\u20131) map\ndescribed in Sect. 4.2. The SiO emission is slightly asymmetric\naround the AGN: the SiO emission peak is at (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)\u223c(0.5\u2032\u2032 ,\n0\u2032\u2032 ). Instead, the CO map shows a maximum at (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)\u223c(1.2\u2032\u2032 ,\n0\u2032\u2032 ) (see Fig. 1 of S00). The latter corresponds to the E CO knot,\nin the notation of S00. The E CO knot is thus shifted \u223c50 pc east\nrelative to the E SiO knot.\n4.2. CN distribution\n\n4. Molecular gas distribution\n4.1. SiO distribution\n\nFigure 2 shows the SiO(2\u20131) intensity map obtained by integrating the emission in velocity channels from v = 967 to\n1307 km s\u22121 . In this velocity range line emission is detected\nat significant \u22653\u03c3 levels on scales larger than the beam inside\nthe PdBI field of view. We overlay the SiO(2\u20131) map on the\nCO(1\u20130) map of S00. The CO map fairly represents the overall molecular gas distribution in NGC 1068. S00 estimated that\nthe CO PdBI map recovers \u224380% of the total flux, based on the\ncomparison between the CO flux measured by the PdBI and the\nflux derived from the CO maps obtained through the combination of the BIMA array and NRAO single-dish data of Helfer &\nBlitz (1995). For the sake of comparison, the spatial resolution\nof the CO(1\u20130) map shown in Fig. 2, originally \u223c1.8\u2032\u2032 , has been\ndegraded to that of the SiO data. In Fig. 2 we also compare the\nSiO map to the morphology of the jet derived from the 3 mm\ncontinuum data.\nUnlike CO, most of the total SiO emission detected inside\nthe PdBI primary beam comes from a circum-nuclear molecular\ndisk located around the AGN, referred to as CND. The integrated\nflux of SiO in the CND is \u223c2 Jy kms\u22121 . This is \u223c74% of the total flux detected by U04 at 28\u2032\u2032 spatial resolution with the 30m\ntelescope towards the AGN. U04 estimate that \u224375% of the SiO\nemission of their AGN spectrum comes from the CND itself,\nwith a residual \u224325% contribution from the SB ring. Taken together, these estimates indicate that the PdBI recovers practically\nall of the SiO flux in the CND. Little SiO emission is detected\nfrom the SB ring in the PdBI map. A few SiO clumps, show4\n\nBoth lines of CN (LF and HF, as defined in Sect. 2) are detected\nin the CND of NGC 1068. As expected, none of the CN lines\nare detected towards the SB ring, as this region is located well\nbeyond the edge of the primary beam of the PdBI at 226.8 GHz.\nThe HF/LF intensity ratio shows no significant spatial variation\ninside the CND. The average ratio, \u223c1.7, is in close agreement\nwith the value expected in the limit of optically thin emission\n(HF/LF\u223c 1.64 \u00b1 0.14). In the remaining of this paper, we will\nuse the higher S/N ratio maps of the HF line.\nFigure 3 shows the intensity map of the HF line of CN(2\u2013\n1) obtained towards the CND of NGC 1068. We have integrated\nthe emission in velocity channels from v = 955 to 1277 km s\u22121 ,\ni.e., similar to the velocity range used to derive the SiO map.\nWith this choice we encompass all significant line emission and\nat the same time avoid blending with the LF CN(2\u20131) line. At\nthis spatial resolution (\u223c1\u2032\u2032 ), the overall morphology of the CND\ntraced by CN roughly resembles that seen in CO lines. At close\nsight there are noticeable differences between these tracers, however. The two CN knots, connected by a bridge of emission on\nthe northern side of the CND, lie at (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)\u223c(0.9\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ) and\n(\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4)\u223c(\u20131.7\u2032\u2032, \u20130.5\u2032\u2032 ). As for SiO, the CN knot located east\nis significantly closer to the AGN compared to the corresponding\nCO knot.\n\n5. Molecular gas kinematics\n5.1. Background from previous work\n\nThe overall kinematics of molecular gas in the disk of NGC 1068\nwere modeled by S00 and B00. One of the scenarios advanced\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nFig. 3. The CN integrated intensity map. Contour levels\nare 3\u03c3, 4\u03c3, 6\u03c3, 9\u03c3, 13\u03c3 to 25\u03c3 in steps of 6\u03c3, with\n1\u03c3=0.40 Jy km s\u22121 beam\u22121 . The AGN is identified by the cross\nand the CN beam is shown by an ellipse.\n\nFig. 2. a) (Upper panel) The SiO integrated intensity map (contour levels are 3\u03c3 to 12\u03c3 in steps of\n1\u03c3=0.082 Jy km s\u22121 beam\u22121 ) is overlaid on the CO(1\u20130)\nintegrated intensity map of S00 (color scale as shown in units\nof Jy km s\u22121 beam\u22121 ). b) (Middle panel) The same as a) but\nshowing a zoomed view on the inner 12\u2032\u2032 around the AGN\n(identified by the cross). c) (Lower panel) The SiO map contours are overlaid on the 3 mm continuum map (color scale) of\nFig. 1. The SiO beam is shown in all the panels by an ellipse.\n\nby S00 invokes the presence of two embedded bars: an outer\noval and a nuclear bar of \u223c17 kpc and 2.5 kpc deprojected diameters, respectively. The two bars are coupled through resonance\noverlapping, so that the corotation of the nuclear bar coincides\nwith the outer inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the oval. The\ngas response inside r \u223c5\u2032\u2032 (350 pc), a region that encompasses\nthe whole CND detected in SiO and CN, would lie between the\nILRs of the nuclear bar.\nS00 and B00 proposed also a nuclear warp model to alternatively account for the anomalous kinematics of molecular gas in\nthe CND. The non-coplanar gas response in the nuclear region\ncould have been caused by the interaction of the molecular disk\nwith the jet or with the associated ionization cone. B00's model\nproposes a warped molecular disk that evolves from a low inclination (i \u223c30\u25e6 ) at r \u223c2.5\u2032\u2032 to a highly-inclined disk (i \u223c77\u25e6 ) at\nr \u223c0.5\u2032\u2032 . This configuration naturally explains the steep velocity\ngradient (high velocities) measured in the major axis positionvelocity (p-v) diagram of CO at small radii (r \u22642\u2032\u2032 ). In particular, S00 favor a hybrid model where the gas response to the bar is\ncombined with a nuclear warp. Besides being able to reasonably\nfit the gas kinematics, the main advantage of the hybrid solution\nover the pure bar model is that the first explains the asymmetric excitation of molecular gas evidenced by the remarkably different R=2\u20131/1\u20130 line ratios measured in the east and the west\nCO lobes. B00 argues that the east lobe, the one showing the\nhigher R, corresponds to the directly X-ray illuminated surface\nof a warped disk, whereas the west lobe corresponds to the back\nof the warped disk, characterized by a lower R. The illumination of the CND gas by X-rays may also explain the particular\nchemistry of molecular clouds analyzed in Sect. 6.2.\nThe kinematics of molecular gas in the inner r \u223c50 pc\nregion are also complex, as recently revealed by the 2.12\u03bcm\nH2 1\u20130 S(1) map of M\u00fcller-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2009). These data,\nmostly sensitive to hot (TK \u2243103 K) and moderately dense\n(n(H2 )\u2243103 cm\u22123 ) molecular gas, show the existence of a structure bridging the CND and the central engine. This connection\nis made through highly elliptical streamers detected in H2 lines.\nDavies et al. (2008) used these data to study the large-scale kine5\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nmatics of molecular gas in the CND itself and concluded that\nthe whole CND is a lopsided ring in expansion (Krips et al.,\nin prep.). The scenario of an expanding ring, first advanced by\nGalliano & Alloin (2002), could be linked to the onset of a nuclear warp instability.\n5.2. SiO kinematics\n\nFigure 4a shows the isovelocity contour map of the CND of\nNGC 1068 derived from SiO. Isovelocities have been obtained\nusing a 3\u03c3 clipping on the data cube. The velocity centroid of\nSiO emission towards the AGN is vAGN \u223c1122\u00b110 km s\u22121 in\nHEL scale. Gas velocities are red (v > vAGN ) on the northwest\nside of the CND, while blue velocities (v < vAGN ) appear southeast. This picture is consistent with a spatially resolved rotating molecular structure. The kinematic major axis is fitted to\nPA \u223c105\u00b110\u25e6 to expand the maximum range of SiO radial velocities at the edge of the CND (r \u22432.5\u2032\u2032 ). This solution lies\nwithin the wide range of PA values derived from the photometric fitting of the disk and, also, from the observed stellar and\ngas kinematics (PA \u223c80\u25e6 \u2013125\u25e6; Brinks et al. 1997; Dehnen et\nal. 1997; S00; B00; Emsellem et al. 2006; Gerssen et al. 2006).\nWe note that SiO isovelocities are twisted to larger position angles (PA \u223c135\u25e6 ) at smaller radii (r \u22641\u2032\u2032 ), which already suggests\nthe presence of non-circular and/or non-coplanar motions in the\nCND. A similar isovelocity twist is seen in other molecular tracers, as pointed out by B00. Outside the CND, the large-scale\nstellar and gas kinematics indicate that the major axis of the disk\nis oriented east-west (Emsellem et al. 2006). We therefore adopt\nin the following PA=90\u25e6 as the best guess for the major axis orientation.\nFigure 4b shows the SiO p-v diagram along the major axis.\nThe p-v diagram is mostly symmetric for the lowest contour levels around the position of the AGN (\u2206x'=0\u2032\u2032 ), and with respect\nto a radial velocity v=v sys(HEL)=1140\u00b110 km s\u22121 . We therefore adopt the first as the dynamical center and the second as\nthe systemic velocity v sys of the galaxy. This value of v sys is in\ngood agreement with all previous determinations of the galaxy's\nreceding velocity (\u223c1137\u00b13 km s\u22121 ; e.g., de Vaucouleurs et\nal. 1991; Huchra et al. 1999). The highest contour levels of the pv plot are shifted east, however; this reflects the overall east-west\nasymmetry of the CND described in Sect.4.1.\nThe steep velocity gradient (high velocities) measured along\nthe major axis at r \u22642\u2032\u2032 can be interpreted at face value as a\nsignature of rotation for a highly inclined disk. Fig. 4b nevertheless confirms the presence of non-circular motions in the CND:\nSiO emission is detected at regions of the p-v diagram which are\nforbidden by circular rotation: emission in quadrants I and II of\nFigure 4b, can be interpreted by gas being in apparent counterrotation and/or moving radially outward. In either case, this can\nbe taken as evidence that gas orbits must be either elongated,\nif they lie in a common plane, or, alternatively, non-coplanar 1 .\nNote that the detection of SiO gas in these regions cannot be explained by beam smearing effects: the deconvolved size of the\nemission for the velocity channels showing the largest excursions into I and II (\u223c1155 km s\u22121 and 1125 km s\u22121 , respectively)\nis \u22431.5\u00d7 the beam size at PA \u223c90\u25e6. Similar features are detected\nin the 0.7\u2032\u2032 resolution CO(2\u20131) map of S00 (Fig.4 of S00). As\ndiscussed in Sect. 5.3, CN emission is also associated with forbidden velocities.\n1\nin this context a combination of elongated and non-coplanar orbits\ncannot be excluded.\n\n6\n\nIn the extended ILR region of the CND it is expected that\nthe gas flow would trace the gradual transition from the x1 orbits\nof the nuclear bar (between corotation and the outer ILR) to the\nx2 orbits (between the ILRs) (e.g., Athanassoula 1992; Buta &\nCombes 1996). Orbits of the x2 family would thus account for\nmost of the CO and SiO emission detected at high velocities at\nr \u22642\u2032\u2032 in the major axis p-v diagrams of Fig. 5a. Contrary to SiO\nemission, which is mainly restricted to the CND, CO emission\nis detected over the SB ring (\u2206x'=\u00b114\u2032\u2032) but also in a region\nthat connects the CND with the SB ring. A significant percentage of the CO emission on these intermediate scales (\u2206x'=\u00b13\u2013\n8\u2032\u2032 ) is detected at low velocities, i.e., at velocities significantly\nbelow the terminal limit imposed by the rotation curve at this\nradii (Fig. 5a). This is the kinematic signature of the gas response to the stellar potential, characterized in this region by the\ncrowding of x1 orbits at the leading edges of the bar (S00; B00).\nAs expected, the x1 + x2 orbit combination produces a doublepeaked line-of-sight velocity distribution in the CO p\u2013v diagram\nthat shows the characteristic figure-of-eight trend as a function\nof radius where high velocities lie at small radii (Kuijken &\nMerrifield 1995; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo & Gu\u00e9lin 1995).\nIn the light of the published dynamical models of NGC 1068\n(S00; B00), we conclude that most of the SiO emission in the\nCND is associated with a region identified as the extended ILR\nregion of the galaxy. Non-coplanar motions have alternatively\nbeen proposed to fit the CND kinematics. Nonetheless in either\ncase (nuclear bar or nuclear warp) the high velocity emission\ndetected in SiO is physically associated with gas lying at small\nradii (r \u22642\u2032\u2032 ).\n\n5.3. CN kinematics\n\nFigure 6a shows the isovelocity contour map of the CND of\nNGC 1068 derived from CN. Isovelocities have been obtained\nusing a 3\u03c3 clipping on the data. Compared to SiO, the higher\nspatial resolution of the CN maps provides a sharper but more\ncomplex picture of the gas dynamics in the CND. The rotating\npattern of the CN emitting gas is highly perturbed. The overall\nkinematics suggest an east-west orientation of the major axis.\nHowever, at close sight the PA of the major axis changes from\n90\u25e6 to 180\u25e6 over the spatial extent of the E CN knot. In addition, isovelocities show an irregular pattern at the W CN knot. In\nspite of the more complex kinematics revealed by the higher resolution CN map on smaller scales, we will nevertheless assume\nin the following the same overall orientation and kinematic parameters determined from SiO. As argued in Sect. 5.2, this is a\nreasonable guess compatible with previous determinations based\non the observed stellar and gas kinematics.\nFigure 6b shows the CN p-v diagram along PA \u223c90\u25e6 . At\nthis spatial resolution the p-v diagram shows a strong east-west\nasymmetry: most of the gas emission appears associated to the E\nknot. Similarly to SiO, CN emission is detected at regions of the\np-v diagram which are forbidden by circular rotation. For CN,\nforbidden velocities appear mostly at quadrant I (see Fig. 6b).\nDue to the higher spatial resolution, the velocity gradient measured along the major axis is \u223ca factor of two steeper in CN than\nin SiO. Otherwise, the two molecular tracers of the CND share\nthe same kinematic features, such as the existence of high velocity emission at small radii (for CN r \u22641\u2032\u2032 ; see Fig. 6b), likely\nconnected to x2 orbits. Like SiO, CN shows no detectable emission at low velocities on intermediate scales (r \u22653\u2032\u2032 ; see Fig. 5 b).\n\n\fS.

Molecular abundances\n\n6.1. SiO abundances in the CND and the SB ring\n\nIn Sect. 6.1 we use the average SiO/CO and SiO/H13 CO+ intensity ratios measured in the CND and the SB ring to derive the\nglobal abundance of SiO in the two regions, using a one-phase\nLVG radiative transfer model. We further analyze in Sect. 6.2 the\nSiO/CO and CN/CO intensity ratio patterns inside the CND, as\nderived from the high-resolution PdBI maps. We discuss how\nthese patterns can be interpreted in terms of different physical/chemical properties of molecular gas in the CND.\n\nWe have estimated the average SiO/CO velocity-integrated intensity ratios (< RSiO/CO >) measured in the CND and the SB\nring regions defined as follows. Based on the CO distribution\nshown in Fig. 2a, we delimit the SB ring as the region between\nr \u223c10\u2032\u2032 and r \u223c20\u2032\u2032 with SiO intensities >2.5\u03c3 levels to derive\nintegrated values. Similarly, the CND region is defined using a\n2.5\u03c3 clipping on the integrated intensities of the SiO map of\nFig. 2b. Intensity units used to derive line ratios are K km s\u22121\n7\n\n\fS.

The two strips overlap in a thinner band\npainted in darker gray.\n6.1.1. LVG model results\n\nFig. 6. Same as Fig. 4 showing in a) (Upper panel) CN isovelocities, derived from the high frequency (HF) 2\u20131 transition of\nCN, contoured over false-color velocity maps. Velocities span\nthe range [1025 km s\u22121 , 1200 km s\u22121 ] in steps of 25 km s\u22121 .\nSimilarly, we show in b) (Lower panel) the p\u2013v diagram of CN\nalong the major axis at PA=90\u25e6. Contour levels are -15.2, 15.2,\n22.8, to 68.4 in steps of 7.6 mJy beam\u22121 . Velocities are referred\nto the HF 2\u20131 line. We highlight the range of the HF and LF lines\nof CN.\nwith K in Tmb scale. The < RSiO/CO > ratios are thus equivalent\nto brightness temperature ratios, as the line widths for SiO and\nCO are comparable at this spatial resolution.\nThe maximum ratio in the SB ring, corrected by the different\nprimary beam attenuation factors, is \u223c0.004\u00b10.001, a ratio estimated from the average spectrum of the clumps detected in SiO.\nThis is a factor of \u223c20 lower than the corresponding ratio averaged over the CND, estimated as \u223c0.08\u00b10.01. The dichotomy\nbetween the CND and the SB ring is apparent from the remarkably different < RSiO/CO > ratios measured in the two regions.\nThe origin of such a dichotomy could be found in the different physical conditions or, alternatively, in the different chemical\nproperties of molecular gas in these two regions. In the following, we use a radiative transfer code to fit the set of available line\nratios in order to disentangle the contribution of different factors.\n8\n\nTo estimate the SiO abundances both in the CND and in the SB\nring, we adopt a one-phase LVG approach to model the radiative transfer of the SiO emission. We use an LVG code to translate the SiO brightness temperatures into the SiO column density\nper velocity width (NSiO /\u22063) and the volume density of its collisional partner, H2 (n(H2 )), in each cloud. We feed into the LVG\ncode the average SiO(2\u20131) brightness temperature (from our\nPdBI observations) and the average SiO(3\u20132)/SiO(2\u20131) velocityintegrated line ratio (from U04), hereafter < R32/21 >, measured\nin each target region. Provided that the 3\u20132 and 2\u20131 SiO emissions arise from the same clouds in each region, < R32/21 > remains independent of the unknown filling factor \u03b7f . To further\nconstrain the model, the gas kinetic temperature is fixed at 50 K,\nas obtained by Tacconi et al. (1994) from multi-transition CO observations of the CND. This assumption is not critical, since the\nresults barely depend on the gas temperature below, e.g., 100 K.\nQuite likely, 100 K is a comfortable upper limit to the average\ntemperature of the SiO emitting gas in a PdBI beam.\nThe output of the LVG code is summarized in Fig. 7. Since\nthe filling factors are unknown the possible solutions for the\nCND (SB ring) clouds would lie over the corresponding <\nR32/21 > isocontour, anywhere to the right of the intersect with\nthe CND (SB ring) SiO(2\u20131) isocontour (i.e., the lower \u03b7f , the\nhigher NSiO /\u22063 in a cloud). The loci of possible solutions become two-dimensional bands, once we also consider the uncertainties in < R32/21 >. The measured < R32/21 > ratios corre-\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\n\u2013 Each target region is characterized by fixed < R32/21 > and <\nRSiO/CO > values 2 , assumed to be independent of the filling\nfactor, and by a certain X.\n\u2013 The measured < R32/21 > allows us to calculate the SiO(2\u2013\n1) brightness temperature as a function of NSiO /\u22063 from the\ndiagram in Fig. 7.\n\u2013 NH2 /\u22063 is proportional to the product of < RSiO/CO > and the\nSiO(2\u20131) brightness temperature. Thus, ultimately, X(SiO)\ncan be expressed in terms of a certain function of NSiO /\u22063\nparameterized by < R32/21 >, < RSiO/CO > ratios and X.\n\u2013 The range of values for NSiO /\u22063 can be constrained. The\nlower limit to NSiO /\u22063 corresponds to \u03b7f = 1. On the other\nhand, for \u03b7f arbitrarily low, the CO(1\u20130) brightness temperatures in a cloud would rise above the assumed kinetic temperature (50 K), which cannot occur if CO is collisionally\nexcited. This sets an upper limit to NSiO /\u22063.\n\n\u22129\n\u221210\n\nCND with X = 4 \u22c5 1019 cm\u22122 (km s\u22121)\n\n\u221211\n\nlog10(X (SiO))\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22127\n\nLVG results for SiO at T K = 50 K\n\nCND with X = 2 \u22c5 1020 cm\u22122 (km s\u22121)\n\n\u221212\n\nSB with X = 2 \u22c5 1020 cm\u22122 (km s\u22121)\n\n11.0\n\n11.5\n\n12.0\n\n12.5\n\n13.0\n\n13.5\n\n14.0\n\nlog10(N (SiO) \u2206v ) [cm\u22122 km s\u22121]\n\nFig. 8. SiO abundances estimated from the LVG model as a function of the SiO column density per velocity width (NSiO /\u22063) in a\ncloud (see text for details). Each blue, black or red curve is defined by three parameters: < R32/21 >, < RSiO/CO > and X. The\nconditions in the SB ring are represented by the red curves and\nthose in the CND by the others. The solid curves correspond to\nthe measured < R32/21 > and the dotted ones to this value \u00b1\u03c3\nlevel. The SB solutions are only given for a Galactic X, while\nin the case of the CND a five times lower X is also considered\n(blue). The areas where the most likely solutions lie are hatched\nas explained in the text. They range in NSiO /\u22063 they cover is so\nthat the CO(1\u20130) brightness temperature in a cloud is neither\nsmaller than the measured brightness temperature, nor higher\nthan the gas kinetic temperature (50 K).\n\nspond to typical gas densities of \u223c 105 cm\u22123 in the CND, while\nthey are & 5 times lower in the SB ring.\nWe search for a reasonable estimate of the SiO abundance\nwith respect to H2 (X(SiO)\u2261 NSiO /NH2 ) in the SB ring and the\nCND. For this we use ancillary CO observations of NGC 1068\nto infer the H2 column density. A full radiative transfer approach (e.g., LVG) is not possible, however, in the SB ring,\nas multi-transition CO observations are not available in this\nregion. Alternatively, we use the standard conversion between\nthe CO(1\u20130) integrated intensities and the H2 column densities\n(NH2 ) given by the so called X factor in the two target regions.\nThe X conversion factor is of order \u223c 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 /(km s\u22121 )\nin the Milky Way (Strong et al. 1988), a value which roughly\nholds true for most nearby galaxies. For the SB ring, we adopt\nthe Galactic X value. It is known, however, that a lower X has\nbeen found in galaxy centers, where molecular clouds are subject to abnormal conditions (e.g., they are unlikely to be virialized). In particular, X in the CND of NGC 1068, could be \u223c 5\ntimes lower than the standard value, according to the estimates\nof U04, a result which is in agreement with the findings obtained\nin the nuclear disks of other spiral galaxies (e.g., Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo\net al. 1993).\nUnder these assumptions, we proceed as follows to estimate\nX(SiO) in the SB ring and the CND:\n\nThe end product of this analysis is the plot in Fig. 8. There\nwe represent X(SiO) as a function of NSiO /\u22063 for the clouds in\nthe SB ring and the CND. In the CND we explore two solutions with X equal to the standard factor and to a five times\nlower value. In either case, we note that the values of X(SiO)\nin the CND, \u223c(1\u20135)\u00d710\u22129, are significantly boosted with respect\nto those typically found in Galactic dark clouds (. 10\u221212 ; e.g.,\nZiurys et al. 1989); this result calls for a mechanism of efficient\ndust grain processing in the CND. It is worth noting that the true\nSiO abundances could be even higher than our estimates if only a\nfraction of the CO emitting clouds were simultaneously emitting\nin SiO (the curves in Fig. 8 would have to be shifted upwards).\nWe also note that X(SiO) is at least &one order of magnitude\nhigher in the CND than in the SB ring. Actually, were X \u223c5\ntimes lower in the CND than in the SB ring, the SiO abundances\nin the two target regions would differ by up to \u223ctwo orders of\nmagnitude.\n6.1.2. SiO/H13 CO+ ratios\n\nThe results of the radiative transfer model described above can\nbe compared to an alternative estimate of the abundance of SiO\nin the CND, based on the observed SiO/H13 CO+ line ratio. The\nH13 CO+ (1\u20130) line, observed simultaneously with the SiO(2\u20131)\nline, has also been detected in the CND of NGC 1068. Compared\nto SiO, the H13 CO+ line is \u223ca factor of three weaker. This ratio\nis significantly larger than that derived by U04 who reported a\nvalue \u223c1 from a 30m spectrum of the CND. The disagreement\nbetween the PdBI and the 30m results is an indication that, compared to SiO, the contamination from the SB ring in H13 CO+ is\nmore severe, and cannot be accurately estimated using the lower\nresolution 30m map.\nGiven the weakness of H13 CO+ in the CND, we omit any discussion on the 2D morphology of the emission of this line. We\nhave nevertheless used H13 CO+ to independently estimate the\nabundance of SiO in the CND using a LVG code to fit the global\nSiO(2\u20131)/H13CO+ (1\u20130) intensity ratio measured in the nucleus\nof NGC 1068. The value of X(SiO) can be derived assuming a\nplausible range of physical conditions for the gas. This relies on\ntwo basic assumptions (see also discussion in Garcia-Burillo et\nal. 2000 and Usero et al. 2006). First, since SiO and H13 CO+\nhave similar dipole moments and the observed transitions have\ncomparable upper state energies, it is plausible to assume similar\nphysical conditions for the two species. In our case we take the\n2\nas for < R32/21 >, we adopt for < RSiO/CO > the average values\nmeasured in the SB and the CND.\n\n9\n\n\fS.

As a second assumption, we take a standard abundance for H13 CO+ =2.5\u00d710\u221210\nand derive X(SiO) from the SiO/H13 CO+ column density ratio\nfitted by LVG. In our case this corresponds to a typical abundance of the main isotope X(H12 CO+ ) =10\u22128 , and to an isotopic\nratio [12 C]/[13 C]\u2243 40, similar to the values found in the CND\nof our Galaxy (Wannier 1980). The derived abundance of SiO\nin the CND is \u223c2.2\u00d710\u22129. This estimate is comfortingly close\nto the lower limit of the X(SiO) value derived from the LVG\nmodeling of the SiO/CO ratios described above. This agreement\nconfirms that the one-phase LVG approach adopted in Sect. 6.1.1\n\n10\n\nprovides a reasonable estimate of the SiO molecular abundances\nin NGC 1068, in spite of the inherent limitations of such a simplified description of the molecular ISM in this model.\n\nWe thus conclude that the dichotomy between the CND and\nthe SB ring, regarding the measured < RSiO/CO > and < R32/21 >\nratios, cannot be attributed to a comparatively higher volume\ndensity of SiO gas in the CND, but mainly to a significant enhancement of the SiO abundance in this region.\n\n\fS.

The changes in RSiO/CO are\nmore significant along the major axis, where the spatial resolution is the highest. RSiO/CO changes by \u223ca factor of three inside\nthe CND: it goes from a peak value of \u223c0.11\u00b10.01 in a region\nclose to the AGN to a minimum of \u223c0.04\u00b10.02 at the eastern\nboundary of the CND (\u2206\u03b1 \u223c+3\u2032\u2032 ); RSiO/CO reaches a secondary\nmaximum (\u223c0.10\u00b10.01) at the western edge of the CND (\u2206\u03b1 \u223c\u2013\n\nFig. 11.

This range of values confirms and significantly expands the\ndifferences in the SiO/CO ratios between the east (\u223c0.07) and the\nwest (\u223c0.10) lobes of the CND, identified by U04 as coming, respectively, from the blue and the red velocity components of the\nline profiles. Figure. 9b shows the SiO/CO ratio displayed here\nas a function of velocity and position across the major axis of\nthe galaxy. The differences in the SiO/CO ratios, which go from\n\u223c0.05 to \u223c0.5, expand out to \u223cone order of magnitude depending on the velocity channel and position along the major axis.\nLine ratios follow a regular pattern, where the highest ratios are\nassociated with high velocities. In particular, the SiO/CO ratio is\n\u223c0.35\u00b10.05 at | v \u2212 v sys |=80\u2013160km s\u22121 towards the AGN and\nthe western secondary maximum. By contrast, the corresponding average ratios at low velocities (| v \u2212 v sys |<+80 km s\u22121 ) are\n\u223ca factor of 6\u20137 lower (\u223c0.05\u00b10.01) at the edges of the CND\n(\u2206x\u2032 =\u00b13\u2032\u2032 ).\n11\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nThe dichotomy between the SiO/CO ratios measured at high\nand low velocities can be interpreted in terms of different physical conditions (i.e., different n(H2 )), or, alternatively, as a signature of chemical differentiation (i.e., different X(SiO)) in the\nCND. Figure. 10a shows the range of possible LVG solutions\nthat fit the CND ratios. We explore two extreme solutions: in\nthe first case, a common X(SiO) is assumed, whereas in the\nsecond case, we adopt a common n(H2 ). While physical conditions and chemical abundances in the gas are to some extent\ninterconnected, by exploring the two extreme cases described\nabove, we can investigate which is the main driving cause of\nthe reported changes in the line ratios. We restrict H2 densities\nto lie within a range of values around the average density derived from the fit of the < R32/21 > ratio measured in the CND\n(n(H2 )=105.1\u00b11.6cm\u22123 ). With these restrictions, Fig. 10a shows\nthat we need \u2265one order of magnitude increase in n(H2 ) to fit\nthe progression of RSiO/CO values observed from low velocities\n(at larger radii) to high velocities (at smaller radii). Alternatively,\nthe scenario of a common n(H2 ) but different X(SiO), suggests a\nmuch wider range of solutions for the CND. In this case, X(SiO)\nwould need to be \u223ca factor of 5\u20136 higher at high velocities.\nAlthough a tenfold increase of n(H2 ) cannot be formally excluded based on these data3 , we note that this solution implies\nthat the change should occur on scales of \u223c200\u2013300 pc (\u223cthe\nCND radius). This is at odds with the significantly smaller differences (\u223ca factor of 2\u20135) that exist between the average densities\nof SiO gas detected in the SB ring and the CND, two regions\nmore than 1 kpc apart. Therefore we can interpret the spatial\nvariations of < RSiO/CO > in the CND as the likely signature of\nchemical differentiation. In this scenario, the abundance of SiO\nis significantly enhanced at high velocities (i.e., at small radii\nr \u22642\u2032\u2032 ; see Sect. 5.2). This interpretation is supported by the correlation found between < RSiO/CO > and the X-ray irradiation of\nthe CND discussed in Sect. 7.2.\n6.2.2. CN abundances\n\nFigure 9c shows the CN(2\u20131)/CO(1\u20130) velocity-integrated intensity ratio (RCN/CO) derived in the CND, using a spatial resolution corresponding to that of the CO map. The average RCN/CO\nratio in the CND is \u223c0.15. The changes in RCN/CO shown in\nFig. 9c are significant along the major axis. RCN/CO changes by\n\u223ca factor of three inside the CND. Similarly to the SiO/CO ratio, the maximum CN/CO value (\u223c0.3\u00b10.03) corresponds to a\nregion very close to the AGN. RCN/CO decreases to \u22640.1\u00b10.04\nat the edge of the CND. Figure. 9d shows the CN/CO ratio here\ndisplayed as a function of velocity and position across the major axis of the galaxy. Similarly to the case of SiO discussed\nabove, an inspection of Fig. 9d shows that the differences in\nthe measured CN/CO ratios are boosted to reach \u223cone order\nof magnitude depending on the velocity channel and position\nalong the major axis. Line ratios follow a regular pattern, with\nthe highest ratios being associated with high velocities. Towards\nthe AGN, the highest CN/CO values (\u223c0.7\u00b10.09) correspond to\nthe high velocity component of the emission. This is in clear\ncontrast with the corresponding values measured at low velocities (\u223c0.1\u00b10.02). Following the scheme of Sect. 6.2.1, we have\nexplored two families of LVG solutions that fit the range of\nCN/CO ratios of the CND assuming a common X(CN) or a\ncommon n(H2 ). For simplicity we restrict H2 densities to lie\nwithin the same range values explored for SiO. P\u00e9rez-Beaupuits\n3\nA high-resolution < R32/21 > map would be required to quantitatively probe SiO density changes inside the CND.\n\n12\n\net al. (2009), based on a multi-transition CN analysis, have derived a more restricted density range (n(H2 )=106\u00b11cm\u22123 ), which\nnevertheless lies within the range explored here. In the first scenario we need about an order of magnitude increase in n(H2 ) to\nfit the progression of ratios from low-velocities to high-velocities\n(see Fig. 10b). The corresponding range of solutions in the second scenario requires \u223ca factor of 5\u20136 increase in X(CN). For\nreasons similar to those described in Sect. 6.2.1, we favor an interpretation of the spatial variations of < RCN/CO > in the CND in\nterms of chemical differentiation. The abundance of CN would\nbe significantly enhanced at high velocities (i.e., at small radii\nr \u22641\u2032\u2032 ; see Sect. 5.3). This interpretation is also supported by the\ncorrelation found between < RCN/CO > and the X-ray irradiation\nof the CND discussed in Sect. 7.2.\n\n7. Molecular gas chemistry in the CND of NGC 1068\nIn the following we consider the pros and cons of two different scenarios, shocks and XDR chemistry, regarding their ability to explain the molecular abundances measured in the CND\nof NGC 1068 for SiO and CN. Complementary information\nprovided by other molecular tracers is a key for this discussion. Furthermore, we use the information extracted from the\nobserved kinematics of the gas and the relation of the derived\nmolecular abundances with the X ray irradiation in the CND.\n7.1. Shock chemistry\n\nTo explore the prevalence of shock chemistry in the CND of\nNGC 1068 we have used the IRAM 30m telescope to observe\na set of lines of two molecular tracers of shocks: CH3 OH and\nHNCO. We discuss below the line ratios derived for CH3 OH,\nHNCO, SiO and CN in NGC 1068, and compare these with the\nratios derived in galactic and extragalactic templates of shock\nchemistry. We also analyze the potential drivers of shocks in the\nCND.\n7.1.1. Tracers of shocks: CH3 OH and HNCO\n\nOn theoretical grounds, large abundances of methanol can only\nbe produced in gas-phase via evaporation and/or disruption of\nicy mantles. Fast shocks (v shock >15\u201320 km s\u22121 ) can destroy\nthe grain cores, liberating refractory elements, like Si, to the\ngas phase (Caselli et al. 1997; Schilke et al. 1997). By contrast, slow shocks (v shock <10\u201315 km s\u22121 ) are able to process\nthe icy grain mantles, but not the grain cores (Millar et al. 1991;\nCharnley et al. 1995). The different location of Si-bearing material (cores) and solid-phase CH3 OH (mantles) in dust grains\nimplies that SiO and CH3 OH are good tracers of fast and slow\nshocks, respectively. It is expected that the disruption of dust\ngrains by slow shocks can inject grain mantle material into\nthe molecular ISM without destroying the molecules (Bergin\net al. 1998, Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado et al 2001). In particular, the abundance of methanol is seen to be enhanced in shocks associated\nwith molecular outflows by more than two orders of magnitude\nover the values typically derived in cold molecular clouds (e.g.,\nBachiller & P\u00e9rez-Guti\u00e9rrez 1997; P\u00e9rez-Guti\u00e9rrez 1999). In external galaxies Meier & Turner (2005) associate over-luminous\nmethanol lines to shocks in IC 342. The close association between SiO and CH3 OH emission in IC 342, discussed by Usero\net al. (2006) corroborates this picture.\nAlthough it is still debated what is the main production\nmechanism of HNCO, models involving dust grain chemistry\n\n\fS.

Ellipses show beams of SiO and CO as in Fig. 9.\nseem to be the most successful at increasing the abundances of\nHNCO in gas phase. There is also supporting observational evidence that HNCO is related to shocks. In particular, Zinchenko et\nal. (2000) finds a good correlation between HNCO and SiO lines\nin dense cores of our Galaxy. Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. (2008) have presented\nevidence of enhanced HNCO in molecular clouds suspected to\nsuffer shocks in the Galactic Center. On larger scales, Meier\n& Turner (2005) interpret the large abundance of HNCO measured in the nuclear spiral structure of IC 342 as due to molecular shocks. In a later study, Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. (2009) observed several lines of HNCO in a sample of nearby starbursts and AGNs,\nconcluding that molecular shocks can enhance the abundance\nof HNCO in galaxies. More recently, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et\nal. (2010) have reported a significant enhancement of HNCO\nin the bipolar outflow L1157, related to the shock chemistry at\nwork in this prototypical young stellar object.\n\n7.1.2. Tracers of shocks in NGC 1068\n\nFigure 11 shows the spectra obtained in the 3\u20132 and 2\u20131 line\nof CH3 OH and in the 4\u20133 line of HNCO towards the CND of\nNGC 1068 with the IRAM 30m telescope. Emission is detected\nin the three lines at significant levels (S/N ratio \u223c7\u201312). Within\nthe errors, the three line profiles appear centered around v sys .\nHowever, the 3\u20132 line of methanol is a factor of 2 narrower than\nthe other two lines. Such a difference cannot be attributed to\nthe \u223c1.5\u00d7 smaller beam of the CH3 OH(3\u20132) line (\u223c17\u2032\u2032 ), as the\nmaximum spread of velocities is already reached on the scales\nof the CND. By contrast this result reflects the lower excitation\nof methanol lines at high-velocities (likely arising in the inner\nCND, as shown by the SiO and CN interferometer maps). This\nsupports the view that there is no significant increase of molecular densities at small radii on the scales of the CND (Sects. 6.2.1\nand 6.2.2).\nTable 2 shows the average CH3 OH(2\u20131)/SiO(2\u20131),\nCH3 OH(3\u20132)/SiO(3\u20132),\nHNCO(4\u20133)/SiO(2\u20131),\nSiO(2\u2013\n1)/CN(2\u20131) and CN(2\u20131)/HCN(1\u20130) line ratios in the CND\n13\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nof NGC 1068 in Tmb scale. We have corrected line ratios\nfrom beam dilution when necessary (single-dish observations)\nusing the usual prescription for a point-like source, which is\napplicable in this context for the CND. Line ratios obtained in\nNGC 1068 are compared with results obtained in the molecular\nlobes (known as B1 and B2) of the bipolar outflow L1157 (data\ntaken from P\u00e9rez-Guti\u00e9rrez 1999 and Nisini et al. 2007). We\nalso list, when available, the line ratios measured in the face-on\nbarred galaxy IC 342 (data taken from H\u00fcttemeister et al. 1997,\nMeier & Turner 2005 and Usero et al. 2006). In the case of\nL1157 we have applied a correction for beam dilution assuming\nthat the sizes of molecular emission in B1 and B2 are 18\u2032\u2032 and\n30\u2032\u2032 , respectively.\nAs a result of this comparison we note the similarity between\nthe ratios derived from CH3 OH, HNCO and SiO lines in L1157\nand NGC 1068. At face value, this indicates that most of the\nSiO emission in the CND of NGC 1068 could be explained by\nfast shocks similar to those identified in the young bipolar outflow L1157. A comparison between the SiO/CN and CN/HCN\nratios measured in L1157 and NGC 1068, indicates a remarkable excess of CN emission in NGC 1068, however. L1157 is\nthe only outflow in which CN(2\u20131) emission has been detected\nin the high velocity gas associated with the bow shocks. But even\nin the case of this extremely molecular-rich young outflow, the\nSiO/CN intensity ratio is \u223ca factor of 10 higher than in the CND\nof NGC 1068. This CN excess questions the suitability of the\nbipolar outflow template in NGC 1068. The age dating of the\nmost recent star formation episode of the CND (>2\u20133\u00d7108 yrs\nold; Davies et al. 2009) also questions the hypothesis that shocks\nin NGC 1068 can be interpreted as stemming from an embedded\npopulation of young stellar objects.\nAlternatively, large-scale shocks produced by cloud-cloud\ncollisions, which are enhanced due to the complex orbital dynamics in the ILR region of the CND, could be a viable mechanism to explain the emission of SiO, CH3 OH and HNCO in\nNGC 1068. SiO maps show the existence of perturbed kinematics of molecular gas in the CND (Sect. 5.2). The prevalence of SiO emission at high and forbidden velocities implies enhanced X(SiO) in gas following non-circular orbits.\nFurthermore, the line ratios discussed in Sect. 6.2.1 suggest an\nenhancement of SiO abundances at the extreme velocities identified in the CND. A similar link between density waves and\nlarge-scale molecular shocks has been proposed to explain the\nenhancement of SiO in the circum-nuclear disks of our Galaxy\n(Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado et al. 1997; H\u00fcttemeister et al. 1998; Rodr\u0131\u0301guezFern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006) and of the starburst galaxies IC 342\nand NGC 253 (Usero et al. 2006; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2000).\nUsero et al. (2006) analyzed the large-scale molecular shocks\nproduced in the ILR region of IC 342. Shocks in this galaxy\nseem to arise during cloud-cloud collisions at low velocities,\nonly after the kinetic energy associated with the density wave\ndriven streaming motions has partly dissipated into turbulence.\nThe comparison between IC 342 and NGC 1068 indicates that\nCH3 OH/SiO and HNCO/SiO ratios are \u223ca factor of two to three\nlower in NGC 1068. The detection of over-luminous SiO lines\nin NGC 1068 could be the signature of comparatively higher velocity shocks in this galaxy, possibly produced by mechanisms\nunrelated to density waves. Other scenarios designed to fit the\nCND kinematics, in particular those invoking a jet-ISM interaction, which would give rise to a nuclear warp and, eventually,\nto an expanding ring, could produce faster molecular shocks in\nNGC 1068.\nGallimore et al. (1996) analyzed the morphology and spectral index of the NGC 1068 jet and concluded that the radio\n14\n\nplasma may have been diverted at a shock interface with the\nmolecular ISM close to the AGN (knot C at r \u223c30-40pc).\nMolecular shocks in the CND could have propagated around\nthe jet-ISM working surface. The H2 line map published by\nDavies et al. (2008; see also M\u00fcller-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2009) reveals\na strongly perturbed velocity field at a region located just 0.5\u2013\n1\u2032\u2032 (35\u201370 pc) north of the AGN. The enhanced SiO abundances\nderived at high velocities 'close' to the AGN may well be the signature of this jet-ISM interaction. Nevertheless, the fact that SiO\ngas is detected elsewhere in the CND suggests that shocks would\nbe at work on larger scales, either driven by an expanding ring or\nby the perturbed kinematics at the ILR region. However, whereas\nshock chemistry can explain the strength and the line ratios of\nthe different molecular shock tracers detected in NGC 1068, it is\nnot a valid explanation for the measured CN abundances.\nThe discrepancies mentioned above motivate the search of\na framework different to shock chemistry that would be able to\nsimultaneously account for the high molecular abundances of\nSiO and CN measured in NGC 1068 (Sect. 7.2).\n7.2. X-ray chemistry\n\nWe describe below the main properties of X-ray emission in\nNGC 1068, with a particular emphasis on the morphology,\nenergetics and origin of hard X-ray emission in the CND\n(Sect. 7.2.1). We further discuss the observational evidence for\nX-ray chemistry in the nucleus of NGC 1068, and how the SiO\nand CN data specifically fit into this picture (Sect. 7.2.2).\n7.2.1. X-ray emission in NGC 1068\n\nWe superpose in Fig. 12a the subarcsec resolution X-ray image\nof NGC 1068 obtained in the 0.25-7.50 keV band with Chandra\n(contours) on the SiO map (color scale). The X-ray image has\nbeen taken from the 3.2s frame time data published by Young\net al. (2001). The 0.25-7.50 keV band image incorporates the\ncontribution from soft to hard X-rays and includes both continuum and line emission. The morphology of the X-ray image reveals spatially resolved emission distributed in a compact yet\nspatially resolved component located on the AGN, and an elongated source that extends to the northeast, similarly to the inner\nradio jet of the galaxy. The northeast elongation of X-ray emission contrasts with the overall east-west elongation seen in the\nCND molecular material detected in SiO and CN. Lower level\nX-ray emission is detected outside the inner 12\u2032\u2032 \u00d712\u2032\u2032 field of\nview (FOV) displayed in Fig. 12a. This outer emission takes\nthe shape of a complex spiral-like structure that extends out to\nr \u223c30-40\u2032\u2032 (see Young et al. 2001 for a detailed description). The\nbrightest region in X-ray emission corresponds with the compact AGN source. The X-ray peak coincides with the highest\nSiO/CO and CN/CO intensity ratios measured in the CND (panels c and d). The contributions to the X-ray luminosity in the\n0.25-7.50 keV band are known to be multiple (line and continuum emission, as well as emission from neutral and ionized material), and therefore the link between the molecular line ratios\nand the 'bolometric' X-ray flux, if any, is not easily interpretable.\nAs argued below, by restricting the study to the hard X-ray band\nthe interpretation is facilitated.\nFigure. 12 (panels b and c) shows the superposition of the\nhard X-ray image obtained in the 6\u20138 keV band by Chandra\n(in contours) on the SiO/CO and CN/CO ratio maps (color\nscale). The X-ray map has been obtained by applying an adap-\n\n\fS.

The coefficient of determination\nof the regression is r2 = 0.6. b) (Right panel) Same as a) but showing the CN(2\u20131)/CO(1\u20130) ratio. The coefficient of determination\nof the regression is r2 = 0.7.\ntive smoothing 4 on the Chandra archive NGC 1068 data available in this wave-band. This image is virtually identical to the\nhard X-ray map originally published and discussed by Ogle et\nal. (2003; see also Young et al. 2001). Emission in this band is\ndominated by the Fe I K\u03b1 line, with a non negligible contribution\nfrom Fe XXV and scattered neutral and ionized continuum reflection (Ogle et al. 2003). Analysis of the 4\u201310 keV continuum\nobserved with ASCA in NGC 1068 led Iwasawa et al. (1997)\nto conclude that most of the hard X-ray flux comes from reflection by cold neutral gas. The strong emission detected in the Fe\nI K\u03b1 line in NGC 1068, a line generated by fluorescence in neutral cold molecular clouds, corroborates this picture. Therefore,\nthe 6-8 keV band image allows us to directly probe to what extent molecular gas in the CND of NGC 1068 is pervaded and\nprocessed by X-rays, without a significant contamination from\nother sources to the X-ray emission.\nThe hard X-ray emission in the inner 12\u2032\u2032 \u00d712\u2032\u2032 FOV shown\nin Fig. 12 b,c is spatially resolved. Young et al. (2001) confirmed\nthe reality of this extended component, and concluded that the\nlatter cannot be attributed to scattering by the telescope PSF. The\ncompact source, located on the AGN, is surrounded by lowerlevel emission that pervades the molecular material of the CND\nout to r \u223c2\u20133\u2032\u2032 . This low-level emission shows a northeast protrusion beyond the CND extent, which aligns with the radio jet.\nThe hard X-ray peak coincides within the errors with the highest\nSiO/CO and CN/CO intensity ratios measured in the CND, interpreted in Sect. 6.2 in terms of a chemical enhancement (higher\nabundances) of SiO and CN. The picture of a correlation between X(SiO), X(CN) and the degree of X-ray irradiation of\nmolecular gas is further illustrated in Fig. 13. There we have plot\nthe SiO/CO and CN/CO ratios derived in Sect. 6.2 versus the Xray flux measured, using a 0.5\u2032\u2032 grid over the CND and a common spatial resolution dictated in each case by the largest beam.\nWithin an admittedly large scatter, Fig. 13 provides tentative evidence of a correlation. The correlation is tighter in the case of\nCN: the corresponding coefficients of determination of the linear\nregressions are r2 =0.7 for CN and r2 =0.6 for SiO. Based on the\nlarger range of molecular line ratios derived when high and low\nvelocities are separately analyzed (Sect. 6.2), we speculate that\nthe correlations of Fig. 13 would have been found to be tighter if\n4\n\nusing version 4.1 of CIAO package\n\nthe spectral resolution of X-ray observations had allowed us to\nkinematically discriminate between the two components.\n7.2.2. X-ray chemistry in NGC 1068\n\nThe CND of NGC 1068 has the basic ingredients to become a\ngiant XDR. First, the nucleus of this Seyfert 2 is a strong X-ray\nemitter. The intrinsic luminosity in the hard X-ray band has been\nestimated to be \u223c1043 \u20131044 erg s\u22121 (e.g., Iwasawa et al. 1997;\nMaloney 1997; Colbert et al. 2002). Furthermore, the central\nengine of NGC 1068 is surrounded by a massive (\u223c5\u00d7107M\u2299 )\ncircum-nuclear molecular disk of \u223c200 pc radius. Thus, most of\nthe molecular mass of the CND lies at a radius \u223c100 pc where\nthe expected hard X-ray flux is \u223c10\u2013100 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . This\nputs the molecular CND of NGC 1068 among the category of\nstrongly irradiated XDRs (Meijerink et al. 2007). As argued in\nSect. 7.2.1, the hard X-ray image of NGC 1068 provides direct\nevidence that molecular gas in the CND is pervaded by X-rays.\nWe therefore expect that the chemistry of molecular gas in the\nCND should show the footprints of X-ray processing predicted\non theoretical grounds. As discussed below, there are specific\npredictions regarding SiO and CN.\nGas-phase models that analyze the chemistry of X-ray irradiated molecular gas foresee high abundances for CN, similar to those measured in the CND of NGC 1068: X(CN)\u223ca few\n10\u22128 \u201310\u22127 (Lepp & Dalgarno 1996; Meijerink & Spaans 2005;\nMeijerink et al. 2007). The abundance of CN is enhanced in\nXDR mainly as a result of the higher ionization degree of the\ngas. For similar reasons, there is theoretical basis supporting\nthe enhancement of CN in PDR environments (e.g.; Boger &\nSternberg 2005; Fuente et al. 1993, 2008; Janssen et al. 1995).\nHowever, based on the age estimated for the most recent star\nformation episode taking place in the CND(>2\u20133\u00d7108 yrs old;\nDavies et al. 2009), and considering that the UV radiation from\nyoung massive stars should dominate the feedback in a starburst, we can safely discard PDR chemistry as the origin for the\nhigh abundances of CN in the CND of NGC 1068. As argued in\nSect. 7.1.2, shocks can also be rejected as an explanation for CN\nabundances.\nThe recent gas-phase models of Meijerink et al. (2007)\nforesee a significant enhancement of SiO in strongly irradiated\n(\u223c10\u2013100 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) high density (\u2265105 cm\u22123 ) XDRs, i.e., in\n15\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\na regime similar to the XDR environment of NGC 1068 where\nwe measure X(SiO)\u223ca few 10\u22129 \u201310\u22128 . In particular, Meijerink\net al. (2007) predict that the SiO(1\u20130)/CO(1\u20130) ratio can reach\na value of \u223c0.10 assuming a standard depletion for silicon in\ngas phase. This is in close agreement with the average SiO(2\u2013\n1)/CO(1\u20130) ratio observed in NGC 1068 (\u223c0.08), assuming that\nthe typical SiO(2\u20131)/SiO(1\u20130) ratios should be \u223c1. The latter\nis an educated guess considering the physical conditions of SiO\ngas in the CND.\nIn addition to the predictions of gas-phase chemistry,\nVoit (1991) has proposed that the abundance of silicon monoxide could also be boosted due to dust grain processing by X-rays.\nThese can evaporate small (\u223c10 \u00c5) silicate grains and increase\nthe Si fraction in gas phase, leading to a considerable enhancement of SiO in X-ray irradiated molecular gas (Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado\net al. 2000; U04; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2008; Amo-Baladr\u00f3n et\nal. 2009). This scenario has been invoked by Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado et\nal. (2000) and Amo-Baladr\u00f3n et al. (2009) to account for the correlation between the abundance of SiO and the equivalent width\nof the Fe K\u03b1 fluorescence line in the Sgr A and Sgr B molecular cloud complexes of the Galactic Center. In the case of the\nGalactic Center, pure gas-phase XDR models have difficulties in\nreproducing the observed SiO abundances, unless an X-ray outburst is assumed to have taken place in Sgr A\u2217 300 yr ago. By\ncontrast, current gas-phase XDR models successfully reproduce\nthe SiO abundances derived in NGC 1068 without resorting to\ndust grain chemistry. Nonetheless, the inclusion of dust grain\nchemistry, likely linked to the mechanical heating of the molecular ISM, would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of species like HCN and HNC, under-predicted by XDR\nschemes (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2008; Loenen et al. 2008; P\u00e9rezBeaupuits et al. 2009). Actually, while CN is overly produced in\ngas-phase XDR models, HCN is under-produced with respect to\nthe level required by observations in AGNs. In addition to mechanical heating, the evaporation of dust grain mantles in dense\nhot environments like those likely prevailing in the nuclear disks\nof AGN, has been invoked as a mechanism responsible of enhancing HCN abundances (Lintott & Viti 2006).\nOther lines of evidence support the existence of an XDR in\nthe CND. The low HCO+ /HOC+ ratios measured by U04 can\nbe explained only if molecular clouds have the high ionization\ndegrees typical of XDR: X(e\u2212 )\u223c10\u22126 \u201310\u22124. Furthermore, the excitation of the 2.12\u03bcm H2 rovibrational emission lines detected\nin the CND (Rotaciuc et al. 1991; Blietz et al. 1994; Galliano\n& Alloin 2002; M\u00fcller-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2009) has been interpreted to be dominated by X-ray emission (e.g.; see discussion\nin Maloney 1997 and Galliano & Alloin 2002)\n\n8. Summary and Conclusions\nWe have used the high spatial resolution and sensitivity capabilities of the PdBI to map the emission of the (v=0, J=2\u20131)\nline of SiO and the N=2\u20131 transition of CN in the disk of the\nSeyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The spatial resolution of these observations (\u223c1\u20133\u2032\u2032 ) have allowed us to separate the emission of\nthe SB ring from that of the CND. The PdBI SiO and CN data,\ntogether with available PdBI CO maps of the galaxy, have been\ncomplemented by single-dish data obtained with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope in SiO, CH3 OH and HNCO lines to probe the physical\nand chemical properties of molecular gas in the CND through an\nanalysis of line ratios.\nWe summarize below the main results obtained in this work:\n16\n\n\u2013 Unlike the CO lines, which show strong emission in the\nSB ring, most of the SiO emission detected inside the PdBI\nprimary beam comes from a circum-nuclear molecular disk\n(CND) located around the AGN. The dichotomy between the\nCND and the SB ring is reflected in the remarkably different\n< RSiO/CO > ratios measured in the two regions. LVG models\nimplemented to fit line ratios indicate that the average abundance of SiO in the CND, < X(SiO)>[CND]\u223c(1\u20135)\u00d710\u22129, is\nabout one to two orders of magnitude higher than that measured in the SB ring.\n\u2013 Similarly to CO, the SiO CND, of \u223c400 pc deconvolved\nsize, shows an asymmetric double peak structure oriented\neast-west. The eastern knot corresponds to the SiO emission\npeak. However, CO and SiO emissions show differences at\nthe scales of the CND. The SiO/CO velocity-integrated intensity ratio changes by about a factor of three inside the\nCND, reaching a peak ratio of \u223c0.10-0.12 towards the AGN\nand the western knot.\n\u2013 The overall SiO kinematics in the CND are consistent with\na rotating structure. However, there is evidence that the\nCND rotating pattern is distorted by non-circular and/or noncoplanar motions. Compared to CO, SiO emission at small\nradii (r \u22642\u2032\u2032 =140 pc) stands out at extreme velocities not accounted for by circular rotation. The highest SiO/CO brightness temperature ratios in the CND are associated with the\nhigh velocities seen towards the AGN and the western knot.\nWe interpret the spatial variations of the SiO/CO ratio in the\nCND as the likely signature of chemical differentiation. In\nthis scenario, the abundance of SiO is significantly enhanced\nat high velocities out to X(SiO)\u223c(0.3\u20131.5)\u00d710\u22128.\n\u2013 CN emission is also detected in a CND around the AGN.\nThe size and morphology of the CND seen in CN are similar\nto those found in SiO. The overall abundance of CN in the\nCND is high: < X(CN)>[CND]\u223c(0.2\u20131)\u00d710\u22127. The CN/CO\nvelocity-integrated intensity ratio changes by about a factor\nof three inside the CND and reaches a peak value of \u223c0.30\ntowards the AGN. CN maps also show distorted kinematics\nthat cannot be explained by circular rotation. The abundance\nof CN is significantly enhanced at high velocities, detected\ntowards the AGN, out to X(CN)\u223c(0.8\u20134)\u00d710\u22127. The emission detected in CN at extreme velocities is physically associated with gas lying at small radii (r \u22641\u2032\u2032 =70 pc).\n\u2013 Different models have been proposed to account for the kinematics of molecular gas in the CND. Large-scale shocks produced by cloud-cloud collisions in the ILR region of the\nNGC 1068 nuclear bar can explain the distorted kinematics\nand enhanced SiO abundances in the CND. The hypothesis\nof a jet-ISM interaction, driving the large-scale expansion of\nthe molecular ring, can also explain shocks. Independent evidence of shocks is provided by the detection of CH3 OH and\nHNCO. Line ratios involving these tracers and SiO in the\nCND are similar to those measured in prototypical shocked\nregions in our Galaxy. However, the strength and abundance\nof CN in NGC 1068 can be explained neither by shocks nor\nby PDR chemistry. Alternatively, the high global abundances\nmeasured for CN and SiO, in agreement with the theoretical\npredictions of XDR models, and the conspicuous correlation\nof CN/CO and SiO/CO ratios with the irradiation of hard Xrays, suggest that the CND of NGC 1068 has become a giant\nX-ray dominated region.\nThe extreme properties of molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk of NGC 1068 result from the interplay between\nseveral processes directly linked to nuclear activity. Results pre-\n\n\fS. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.: Molecular gas chemistry in AGN\n\nsented in this paper highlight, in particular, the footprint of\nshocks and X-ray irradiation on the properties of molecular gas\nin this Seyfert. Whereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation for CN and SiO in NGC 1068, the relevance of shocks\ndeserves further scrutiny, however. In particular, sub-arcsecond\nspatial resolution observations, to be done at higher frequencies\nand in clear-cut molecular tracers, will be paramount to locate\nthe occurrence of shocks in the CND and determine the gas\nmass and energies involved in the process. Increasing the spatial resolution at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths will\nbe also a key to explore in detail the correlation between molecular abundances and X-ray irradiation, tentatively identified in\nthis work. Furthermore, increasing the number of molecular line\ntransitions observed with high-spatial resolution will allow us\nto fit the different line ratios using multi-phase radiative transfer\nschemes. These are a better description of the multi-phase nature\nof the molecular ISM in galaxies. In particular, these models will\nproperly take into account the fact that the emission of different\nlines can arise from regions characterized by very different densities and kinetic temperatures.\nAcknowledgements.
