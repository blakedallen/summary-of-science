Extragalactic UHE \u03b3-ray astronomy falters for energies greater than a few tens of\nTeV due to interactions with infrared and Cosmic Microwave Background\nphotons. The information carried by the neutrino messengers from distant, unexplored regions of the universe may help to unravel longstanding\nmysteries associated with the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays. Several models1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 predict high energy charged particle and neutrino\nemission; the diffuse \u03bd-flux predictions by these models are constrained by\n\u2217 http://www.icecube.wisc.edu\n\n\fSeptember 28, 2013\n\n20:38\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nSilvestri \u0307AMANDA\n\n2\n\nthe observed cosmic ray fluxes7 . AMANDA8 , the first neutrino telescope\nconstructed in transparent ice, is deployed between 1500 m and 2000 m\nbeneath the surface at the geographic South Pole. It is designed to search\nfor neutrinos that originate in the most violent phenomena in the observable universe. Galactic objects like Supernova Remnants (SNR) and extragalactic objects such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are expected to be\nthe powerful engines accelerating protons and nuclei to the highest energies, which eventually interact to generate neutrinos. We have searched for\npoint sources in the northern sky and for a diffuse flux of UHE (E\u03bd > 1015\neV) neutrinos of cosmic origin. We have performed the analysis using data\ncollected in 2003 with a new data acquisition system based on Transient\nWaveform Recorders (TWR-DAQ), which we compared to data collected by\nthe standard AMANDA readout system (\u03bc-DAQ).\n\nFig. 1.

The performance of the TWR-DAQ is verified by comparing the results for the absolute rate of atmospheric neutrinos and the\ncos(\u03b8) distribution with the results from the standard \u03bc-DAQ11 . Extending\nthe analysis tools to include TWR data required several new developments:\n(1) The TWR-DAQ measures the integrated charge Q from the full waveform\nof the PMT pulses, in contrast, the \u03bc-DAQ only measures the maximum\namplitude of the PMT pulse in a 2 \u03bcs window. (2) Various time offsets\nwere taken into account for the TWR-system, none of which impacted the\n\u03bc-DAQ. A time resolution of few nanoseconds was extracted. (3) The size\nof the TWR-DAQ data set (20TB for 2003) by far exceeds that of the \u03bc-DAQ\n(\u223c1TB), requiring an improved data handling tools.\n\n2.

The TWR-DAQ timing calculations are\nrelative to the values measured by the \u03bc-DAQ. The timing of the TWR-DAQ\nsystem includes two sources of jitter, the digitization window of 10 ns and\nthe time fluctuation of the flash ADC clocks within the same 10 ns interval.\nThis accounts for the \u03c3\u2206t \u223c 4 nsb . Amplitudes are also calibrated by extracting the number of photo-electrons (Npe) detected from the peak ADC\nof the \u03bc-DAQ and charge Q of the TWR system and normalized to 1-pe amplitude. By integrating the charge from pulses in the waveform, the dynamic\nrange of the TWR-DAQ extends to Npe of \u223c 100, a factor of three higher than\nthe \u03bc-DAQ. Fig. 2 (right) shows the reconstructed amplitude of the TWR-DAQ\ncompared to the \u03bc-DAQ, which indicates a stable power law distribution\nextending up to 100 Npe, while the \u03bc-DAQ system shows a \"knee\" around\n10 Npe. The knee is due to the amplitude saturation of channels read out\nby optical fibers, which comprise \u223c40% of the AMANDA channels.c After cleaning, the muon track is reconstructed from the pulse times of the\nPMTs.

A full search of the northern sky was\nperformed to look for any localized event cluster.

Fig. 6 shows the sky map of the\ncalculated significance for all observed 1112 events in terms of the a positive or negative deviation with respect to the mean background events.\nAll observed regions with the highest significance are compatible with the\nbackground hypothesis. The highest significance observed shows a positive\ndeviation of 4.3 \u03c3, which corresponds to a probability of 23% for a search\nperformed on events with randomized right ascension.\n2\n\n\u03bd\nAeff\n(cm )\n\nE2 d\u03a6/dE (10 GeV cm-2 s-1)\n\n106\n\n0o > \u03b4 > 15o\n105 15o > \u03b4 > 35o\no\no\n104 35o > \u03b4 > 75o\n75\n>\n\u03b4\n>\n90\n103\n\n0.3\nTWR-DAQ data 2003\n\n-6\n\n0.25\n\n102\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n10\n1\n10-1\n\n0.1\nMUON-DAQ data 2003\n\n0.05\n\n10-2\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nlog10 (E/GeV)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nsin(\u03b4)\n\nFig. 7.

Therefore a calculation of the neutrino effective area for\npoint source search using TWR data is now feasible.

Together with the average upper limit extracted from the TWR-DAQ data,\nthe limit from the \u03bc-DAQ data of year 200313 is also represented for comparison. These results are comparable, however the TWR-DAQ limit is \u223c 10%\nworse than the \u03bc-DAQ limit, because conservative event selection criteria\nhave been applied that do not use the full waveform information in an optimal way.

Search for UHE Neutrinos\nThe search for UHE neutrinos differs from the point source mainly in two\naspects. First, the search for point sources is restricted to upward going\nevents of energy within the TeV scale, the UHE analysis extends the search\nbeyond PeV energies. Second, while point sources are localized in a small region of the sky, UHE diffuse neutrinos are expected to come from the entire\nvisible sky (2\u03c0 sr), with a higher probability to originate from the horizon.\nFig. 8 shows one of the 1112 upward going neutrino events and an almost\nhorizontal UHE simulated neutrino event with energy E \u223c 3 \u00d7 1015 eV.\nSimulated events with energy above one PeV deposit a substantial amount\nof light which is recorded by almost all PMTs. In order to better separate\nbackground events from signal events, we developed new variables which\nexploit the information of the full waveforms.

Conclusion\nThe point source search provides the first detailed evaluation of the performance of the TWR-DAQ system. This analysis demonstrated that the TWR-DAQ\nproduces similar event rates and angular distribution as the data collected\nby the standard \u03bc-DAQ system. No statistically significant excess has been\nobserved after performing a full search of the northern hemisphere of the\nsky for localized event clusters, therefore a flux limit based on TWR-DAQ\ndata is calculated. The AMANDA TWR readout is now being incorporated\ninto the IceCube data acquisition system. By exploiting the information of\n\n\fSeptember 28, 2013\n\n20:38\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nSilvestri \u0307AMANDA\n\n11\n\nthe full waveforms from the TWR-DAQ system, it is possible to develop new\nanalysis techniques for an improved search for diffuse UHE neutrinos. Currently the AMANDA experiment has placed the most stringent neutrino\nflux limits to date, which can be further improved by analyses performed\nwith TWR-DAQ data.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author acknowledges support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Division, the NSF-supported TeraGrid systems at the\nSan Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), the Phi Beta Kappa Alumni in Southern California for providing travel grants, the Astrophysics Associates, Inc.,\nItalian Ministry of Education, European Physical Society, Ettore Majorana\nFoundation, and the Electron Tubes Ltd. for providing the full scholarship\nat Erice.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n\nF.
