The connection between CTRWs and\nthe associated \"more macroscopic\" description, which is\nin general an integro-differential equation rather than a\n(partial) differential equation as in the case of diffusion,\nhas been firmly established. The more macroscopic description is often attractive because all the machinery\nof integro-differential equations and associated boundary conditions can be brought to bear in their solution.\nIt should be noted that the starting point for problems\nthat involve subdiffusive or superdiffusive particles is often simply the integro-differential equation itself. However, one must exercise caution in simply starting with\nsuch a macroscopic description. It should also be noted\nthat these integro-differential equations can arise from\nmicroscopic models other than a CTRW, the latter not\nalways being the appropriate framework. An example is\nthe motion of particles in random landscapes of various\nsorts, for example, one in which each site is associated\nwith a potential well whose depth is chosen from a random distribution. The walk in a landscape of potential\nwells of random depths may be normal in the sense that\nthe escape from each well follows a Kramers law, but the\nirregularity of the landscape may give rise to trapping\nevents that may slow down the progress of the particles\nto the point of subdiffusion.\nThe situation becomes much more complicated when\nthe moving particles also undergo reactions [1, 2]. This\napplies to situations such as reversible or irreversible con-\n\nversion to a different species (e.g., A \u2192 B [3, 4, 5] or\nA \u21cb B [5]), reactions giving rise to propagating fronts\n(say, A + B \u2192 C [6], A + B \u2192 2A [7]), binary reactions (e.g., A + A \u2192 0), or even spontaneous evanescence\n(A \u2192 0). Focusing on the latter case, the description of\nthe evolution of such evanescent particles at the macroscopic level of a subdiffusion or superdiffusion equation,\nand the investigation of the proper way to include the\nevanescence or reaction in such equations, is a matter of\ncontinuing study and is usually carried out in the context\nof rather specific models [3, 8].\nIn this paper we pursue this goal somewhat more\ngenerically: we consider the deduction of subdiffusion or\nsuperdiffusion equations when the moving particles are\nintrinsically evanescent. The death rate of the particles\nmay in general depend on location, time, how long a particle has spent at a particular location \u2013 one can think\nof a large variety of death scenarios. Our presentation\nis based on a CTRW formulation generalized to include\nparticle evanescence. One step of the discussion concerns\nthe way in which evanescence can be built into a CTRW\nmodel, a choice which is not unique. The second step\nis then to go from a CTRW model to a subdiffusion or\nsuperdiffusion equation as appropriate.\nIn Sec. II we start with some basic CTRW quantities\nand relations, which we then use in Sec. III to construct\nan integral equation for the probability density of finding\na particle at a certain position at time t given that it began its motion at a different position at time t = 0. This\nintegral equation includes the possibility that the particle evanesces along the way, and is the starting point for\nthe further derivation of subdiffusive and superdiffusive\nequations. In Sec. IV we explicitly construct our fractional equations for the case of subdiffusion, superdiffusion, and a mixture of the two. We conclude with a\nsummary and some thoughts for the future in Sec. V.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nSTARTING WITH A CTRW\n\nOur goal is to arrive at integro-differential equations\nfor the probability density w(r, t|r0 , 0) for a particle that\nstarted its journey at point r0 at time t = 0 to be at r\nat time t. No matter how we arrive at such an equation,\nthe description of the motion of the particles as a CTRW\nrequires the introduction of the probability density \u03a8(r\u2212\nr\u2032 , t\u2212t\u2032 ) that a random walker jumps in a single step from\nr\u2032 to r after waiting a time interval t\u2212t\u2032 at the position r\u2032 .\nThe dependence on only the difference of the two position\nvectors reflects an assumption of spatial homogeneity for\nthe jumping mechanism. Associated with this probability\ndensity is the usual waiting time probability density,\nZ\n\u03c8(t) = dr\u2032 \u03a8(r\u2032 , t),\n(1)\nand also the probability density for a single step displacement,\nZ \u221e\ndt\u2032 \u03a8(r, t\u2032 ).\n(2)\n\u03c7(r) =\n0\n\nThe \"normal\" or \"anomalous\" (subdiffusive or superdiffusive) character of the process depends on the forms of\nthe probability densities, which we will specify later.\nSince we deal with evanescent particles, we also introduce the probability \u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ) that the particle has not\ndied spontaneously during the stepping process described\nby \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 ). Also, finding the particle at r at time\nt does not mean that it jumped onto that location exactly at that time. In fact, it might have jumped there\nat an earlier time and then just waited there without dying, or it might have jumped there at an earlier time,\nreturned any number of times before t, and then waited\nthere. As a starting point in our route to an integral\nequation for w(r, t|r0 , 0), it is thus appropriate to introduce qn (r, t|r0 , 0), the probability density that a particle\nbe at position r at time t exactly after making its nth\njump, given that it started its walk at time t = 0 at position r0 [8]. This initial condition is described by the\nequation\nq0 (r, t|r0 , 0) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ) \u03b4(t).\n\n(3)\n\nFrom this follows the definition\n\nintegral recurrence equation\nZ\nZ t\nqn+1 (r, t|r0 , 0) =\ndr\u2032\ndt\u2032 \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n0\n\n\u00d7 qn (r\u2032 , t\u2032 |r0 , 0) \u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ).\n\nIn words, this says that the probability that the particle\narrives at location r at time t on the (n+1)st step is equal\nto the probability that it arrives at r\u2032 at an earlier time\nt\u2032 on the nth step and then steps from r\u2032 to r at time t,\nprovided it does not die in the interval between these two\nsteps. The usual integral equation without evanescence\nis immediately recovered upon setting \u039e equal to unity.\nSumming this equation over step number n, the integral\nequation\nZ\nZ t\nq(r, t|r0 , 0) =\ndr\u2032\ndt\u2032 \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n0\n\n\u00d7 q(r\u2032 , t\u2032 |r0 , 0) \u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ) + q0 (r, t|r0 , 0)\n(6)\n\nimmediately follows.\nThe more complex question is now how to go from\nthese integral equations to one for the desired probability\ndensity w(r, t|r0 , 0) and thence to a fractional diffusion\nequation. This is our pursuit in the next section.\nIII.\n\nINTEGRAL EQUATION WITH\nEVANESCENCE\n\nBefore obtaining an integral equation from the CTRW\nsetup of the last section, we note that one could choose\nto write such an equation directly, for example,\nZ\nZ t\n\u2032\ndt\u2032 \u03a5 (r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 )\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) =\ndr\n0\n\n\u00d7w(r\u2032 , t\u2032 |r0 , 0) \u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 )\n+ \u03a6(t) \u039e(r, r; t, 0)\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ),\n(7)\nwhere we have introduced\nZ t\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a6(t) = 1 \u2212\ndt \u03c8(t ) =\n0\n\nq(r, t|r0 , 0) \u2261\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nqn (r, t|r0 , 0),\n\n(4)\n\nn=0\n\nwhich is the probability density that the particle steps\nonto position r exactly at time t (regardless of how many\ntimes the particle has stepped anywhere, including on r,\nbefore this time).\nIt is straightforward to write integral equations for the\nprobability densities q and qn . For qn no further discussion beyond the definitions is necessary to write the\n\n(5)\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\u2032 \u03c8(t\u2032 ),\n\n(8)\n\nt\n\nthe probability that the particle does not take a step in\nthe entire time interval up to time t. Note that we have\nmade a point of using \u039e rather than \u039e for the function indicating that no death occurs, because in general there is\nno reason to expect these two to be the same. The function \u039e that appears in the integral equations obtained\nabove is the probability that the particle does not die in\na time interval exactly delineated by two steps (and none\nin between), one taking it to location r\u2032 and the other to\nlocation r. On the other hand, \u039e is the probability that\n\n\f3\nthe particle does not die in a time interval t \u2212 t\u2032 as it\nmoves from r\u2032 to r, with no reference to steps. There is\nno a priori reason for these two probabilities to be equal.\nIf particles die at a constant rate independent of position\nand of when steps take place, then these two probabilities would be equal. However, for example if particles\ndie only when they take a step, or, conversely, if particles are more likely to die if they remain at one location,\nthen these probabilities would not be equal. Also, we\nhave denoted the kernel of the integral equation by the\nnew symbol \u03a5 because a priori we do not know its connection to \u03a8. One might attempt reasonable guesses, but\nthat is all so far and in fact somewhat risky.\nOur goal is to obtain an equation such as Eq. (7) starting from a CTRW (rather than just writing it down). We\ntherefore begin with Eq. (6) together with the exact relation\nZ t\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) =\ndt\u2032 \u03a6(t \u2212 t\u2032 )q(r, t\u2032 |r0 , 0) \u039e(r, r; t, t\u2032 ).\n\nneither moved nor died until time t. Earlier arrivals and\nreturns are implicitly included in this relation.\nIn order to proceed toward an integral equation of the\nform (7) with known kernel we find ourselves having to\nmake two admittedly debatable assumptions. One is that\nthe functions \u039e and \u039e are equal. The other is that this\nfunction can be written as a ratio of the form\n\u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ) =\n\n(9)\nThis exact relation simply says that the probability density for the particle to be at r at time t is the probability\nthat it stepped onto that location at time t\u2032 < t and then\n\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) =\n\nt\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndt \u03a6(t \u2212 t ) \u039e(r, r; t, t )\n\n0\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n(10)\n\nThe special case of location-independent exponential decay \u03c6(r, t) = exp(\u2212kt) (that is, the case of evanescence at\na constant rate, mentioned earlier), is that of Sokolov et\nal. [3], and in this case \u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ) = exp[\u2212k(t \u2212 t\u2032 )].\nThis is the only choice for which \u039e depends on time\nonly through the difference of its time arguments. While\nEq. (10) is limiting, it is more general than the cases that\nhave been treated in the literature.\nTo make use of the special form (10) we start by making the replacements t \u2192 t\u2032 and t\u2032 \u2192 t\u2032\u2032 in Eq. (6). We\nthen multiply by \u03a6(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u039e(r, r; t, t\u2032 ), integrate over t\u2032 ,\nand use relation (9) to write\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(r, t)\n.\n\u03c6(r\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n\n\u2032\n\ndr\n\nt\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n!\n\ndt \u03a8(r \u2212 r , t \u2212 t )q(r , t |r0 , 0) \u039e(r, r ; t , t )\n\n0\n\ndt\u2032 \u03a6(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u039e(r, r; t, t\u2032 ) q0 (r, t\u2032 |r0 , 0).\n\n(11)\n\n0\n\nThis equation can be manipulated through a number of\nsimple steps. First, we insert the special form Eq.

This leaves us with the equation\n\nZ\n\nt\u2032\n\n0\n\nq(r\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 |r0 , 0)\ndt\u2032\u2032 \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 , t\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032\u2032 )\n\u03c6(r\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 )\n\n!\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 \u03a6(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\nq0 (r, t |r0 , 0)\n.\n\u03c6(r, t\u2032 )\n\nNext, we recognize that the first term on the right is\na double convolution with respect to time. The memory kernels can then be exchanged, as can be verified by\n\n(12)\n\ntaking Laplace transforms. Multiplying the rearranged\nequation by \u03c6(r, t) it is then easy to see that\n\n\f4\n\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) =\n\nZ\n\n+\n\nZ\n\ndr\u2032\n\nZ\n\nt\n0\n\n\u03c6(r, t)\ndt\u2032 \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\u03c6(r\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 \u03a6(t \u2212 t\u2032 )q0 (r, t\u2032 |r0 , 0)\n\n0\n\nZ\n\ndr\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u2032\n\n\u03c6(r\u2032 , t\u2032 )\ndt\u2032\u2032 \u03a6(t\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032\u2032 )q(r\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 |r0 , 0)\n\u03c6(r\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 )\n\n!\n\n\u03c6(r, t)\n.\n\u03c6(r, t\u2032 )\n\nFinally, using Eq. (9) and the initial condition (3), and\nagain recalling the special form (10) we arrive at the de-\n\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) =\n\nZ\n\n(13)\n\nsired integral equation\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 )w(r\u2032 , t\u2032 |r0 , 0)\u039e(r, r\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ) + \u03a6(t)\u039e(r, r; t, 0)\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ).\n\n(14)\n\n0\n\nEquation (14) is the starting point for the derivation of\nvarious fractional diffusion equations for different forms\nof the single step probability density \u03a8(r \u2212 r\u2032 , t \u2212 t\u2032 ) of\nthe underlying CTRW. It is therefore a centerpiece of this\nwork. Note that the special form (10) has led to a kernel\nin the integral equation that is precisely this single step\nprobability density even though the times t and t\u2032 are not\nnecessarily associated with jumping times. We also stress\nonce again that in addition to the simplification (10) we\nhave assumed the equality of the survival functions \u039e and\n\u039e. Equation (14) has a clear physical interpretation: it\nconsiders all possible ways for a particle to be at point r\nat time t by looking at the positions r\u2032 at prior times t\u2032\nand then tracking their subsequent arrival at the desired\npoint. If the point under consideration is the initial position, the equation tracks the possibility that the particle\nhas not moved by time t. In the language of Hughes [13]\n(Sec. 3.2.8), Eq. (14) corresponds to a \"partition over\nthe last step.\" The equation counts only those particles\nthat do not evanesce in the process.\nFinally, we shall implement one additional simplifying\nassumption widely adopted in the literature, namely,that\nthe waiting time and jump displacement distributions are\nmutually independent, so we can write\n\u03a8(r, t) = \u03c8(t)\u03c7(r).\n\n(15)\n\nDifferent fractional diffusion equations then arise depending on the behaviors of the tails of these distributions.\nWe proceed to present various cases in the next section.\nOur derivations closely follow known results presented in\na number of helpful review sources such as the reports\nof Metzler and Klafter [10, 11] and a recent multiau-\n\nthored compendium on anomalous processes [12]. Our\nmain purpose here is to add evanescence to the mix and\nto determine how the evanescence \"reaction\" enters these\nequations. In particular, when \u03c8(t) has long tails and\n\u03c7(r) does not, we will arrive at a fractional subdiffusion\nequation. When, on the other hand, \u03c7(r) has long tails\nbut \u03c8(t) does not, we arrive at a superdiffusive equation.\nThe most \"anomalous\" case occurs when both have long\ntails, which leads to a bifractional equation.\nWe end this section with a practical consideration. Instead of working with the probability density of interest,\nw(r, t|r0 , 0), it turns out to be more convenient to work\nwith a ratio introduced earlier,\n\u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0) =\n\nw(r, t|r0 , 0)\n.\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\n(16)\n\nDividing Eq. (14) by \u03c6(r, t) and taking the Fourier (for\nspace)-Laplace (for time) transform, we find\niq*r0\n\u02c6 u) = \u03c7\u0302(q)\u03c8\u0303(u)\u03b7\u0303(q,\n\u02c6 u) + \u03a6\u0303(u) e\n\u03b7\u0303(q,\n.\n\u03c6(r0 , 0)\n\n(17)\n\nTogether with the relation\n\u03a6\u0303(u) =\n\n1 \u03c8\u0303(u)\n\u2212\nu\nu\n\n(18)\n\nand the convolution theorems for both Fourier and\nLaplace transforms, we arrive at the Fourier-Laplace\ntransformed reaction-diffusion equation with evanescence, equivalent to Eq.

Here \u03ba is a dimensionless constant and\n\u03c4D is a characteristic mesoscopic time (but not a first\nmoment). The small-u behavior of the Laplace transform\nof the waiting time distribution reads\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c8\u0303(u) \u223c 1 \u2212 Au ,\n\n(21)\n\n\u03b3\nwith A = \u03b3 \u22121 \u03ba\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c4D\n.\nWe take the jump distance distribution to be \"normal,\" that is, it has finite moments. In this case, we are\ninterested in small values of q = |q|, for which one can\nexpand the Fourier transform of the jump displacement\ndistribution and retain only the first two terms,\n\n\u03c7\u0302(q) \u223c 1 \u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 q2\n+ O(q4 ),\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the second moment\nZ\n2\n\u03c3 = dr r2 \u03c7(r)\n\n\u2202w(r, t|r0 , 0)\n= \u03c6(r, t) K\u03b3\n\u2202t\n\n(23)\n\n0\n\n\u02c6 u) \u2212\nu\u03b7\u0303(q,\n\neiq*r0\n\u03c3 2 q2 \u02c6\n= \u2212u1\u2212\u03b3\n\u03b7\u0303(q, u).\n\u03c6(r0 , 0)\n2A\n\n(24)\n\nLaplace and Fourier inversion then yield\n\nSubdiffusion is characterized by a waiting time distribution with a tail so long that it lacks integer moments,\nthat is,\n\u0012\n\nis assumed to be finite.\nSubstitution of the expansions (21) and (22) into\nEq. (19) and neglect of a term of O(uq2 ) (which is unimportant in the asymptotic regime of small wave vectors\nand low frequencies) leaves us with\n\nDt1\u2212\u03b3 \u22072r\n\nEquation (29) is the first mesoscopic highlight of our paper in that all further results for subdiffusion are obtained as special cases. It is perhaps the most general\nfractional subdiffusion equation associated with a CTRW\nwith evanescence for a single-species system obtained to\ndate. It is not as general as one might hope because of\nthe rather stringent condition (10), but to the best of\nour knowledge it does include the equations currently in\nthe literature. The results of Sokolov et al. [3] and the\nexplicit results in Henry et al. [8] are recovered if we set\n\u03c6(r, t) \u221d exp(\u2212kt).\n\n\u2202\u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0)\n= K\u03b3\n\u2202t\n\n0\n\nDt1\u2212\u03b3 \u22072r \u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0),\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we have introduced the anomalous diffusion coefficient\n\u03c32\n.\n(26)\nK\u03b3 =\n2A\nThe integrodifferential operator Dt1\u2212\u03b3 acting on y(t) is\ndefined as the inverse Laplace transform of u1\u2212\u03b3 \u1ef9(u),\n\b 1\u2212\u03b3\nL\u22121\n\u1ef9(u) =\nu\u2192t u\n\n0\n\nDt1\u2212\u03b3 y(t),\n\n(27)\n\nand is closely related to the Riemann-Liouville operator\n1\u2212\u03b3\ndefined by\n0 Dt\n1\u2212\u03b3\nf (r, t)\n0 Dt\n\n1 \u2202\n=\n\u0393(\u03b3) \u2202t\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032\n\n0\n\nf (r, t\u2032 )\n.\n(t \u2212 t\u2032 )1\u2212\u03b3\n\n(28)\n\nIn fact, both operators Dt1\u2212\u03b3 and 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b3 are the same\nwhen applied to sufficiently regular functions f (t) as deRt\ntermined by the condition limt\u21920 0 d\u03c4 (t\u2212\u03c4 )\u03b3\u22121 f (\u03c4 ) = 0\n(see Pgs. 384 and 118 in [12]). This condition is satisfied\nfor all situations of interest here.\nIn terms of the probability density w, Eq. (25) explicitly yields the fractional reaction-subdiffusion equation\n\n1\n\u03c6\u0307(r, t)\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) +\nw(r, t|r0 , 0).\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\n(29)\n\nSomewhat more elaborate is the connection with the\nrecent work of Fedotov [14], which in turn recovers the\nmore general results in [8]. In the language of Fedotov\ntranslated to our work, his choice corresponds to the particular selection (in one dimension)\n\u001aZ t\n\u001b\n\u03c6(x, t) = exp\n(30)\nr[\u03c1(x, t\u2032 )]dt\u2032 .\n\u03c4\n\nHere in Fedotov's language the chemical reaction responsible for the evanescence is assumed to follow the law of\nmass action so that the reaction term is of the form r(\u03c1)\u03c1,\n\n\f6\nthat is,\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u03c1\u0307\n= r[\u03c1(x, t)].\n\u03c1 Reaction\n\nLaplace transform at small argument (corresponding to\nlong times) behaves as\n(31)\n\nIn turn, \u03c1(x, t) is the density of (surviving) particles at\npoint x at time t, which is related to our probability\ndensity via an integration over all initial positions,\nZ\n\u03c1(x, t) = dx0 w(x, t; x0 , 0).\n(32)\nThe time \u03c4 in Eq. (30) is an arbitrary reference time\nthat can be chosen to be zero. Specifically, the choice\n\u03c4 = 0, substitution of Eq. (30) into our general equation (29), and subsequent integration over the initial condition leads exactly to Eq. (19) in Ref. 14, which is thus\nagain a special case of our more general formalism. The\nresult is especially noteworthy because the probability\nof spontaneous death is not set a priori but depends on\nthe changing density itself, This leads to an interesting\ncomplex nonlinear problem.\nAs a final note in this section we mention that under\nthe same conditions that led to our subdiffusive fractional\nequation (29) with a Riemann-Liouville operator, we can\narrive at an equivalent fractional subdiffusion equation\nof Caputo form. It turns out to be\n\u2202 \u03b3 w(r, t|r0 , 0)\nw(r, t|r0 , 0)\n= K\u03b3 \u22072r\n.\n\u03b3\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\n(33)\n\nThis is in general not our preferred choice because of the\ndifficulties in carrying out the Caputo fractional derivative of a product.\n\n\u03c8\u0303(u) \u223c 1 \u2212 \u03c4 u.\n\n(34)\n\nFor the jump length distribution we assume an inverse\npower law behavior,\n\u03c7(r) \u223c\n\n\u03c3\u03bc\nr1+\u03bc\n\n(35)\n\nwith 1 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 2 and r = |r|.

Again, it turns out to be convenient to work with\nEq. (17). Substitution of the above expansions into this\nequation, retention of leading terms, and some simple\nalgebra leads to\n\u02c6 u) \u2212\nu\u03b7\u0303(q,\n\neiq*r0\n\u03c3\u03bc \u02c6\n= \u2212 q \u03bc \u03b7\u0303(q,\nu),\n\u03c6(r0 , 0)\n\u03c4\n\n(37)\n\nor, inverting the time Laplace transfrom,\n\u2202\n\u03c3\u03bc\n\u03b7\u0302(q, t) = \u2212 q \u03bc \u03b7\u0302(q, t).\n\u2202t\n\u03c4\n\n(38)\n\nLet \u2202 \u03bc /\u2202r\u03bc be the operator defined by the following\nFourier transform property,\n\u001b\n\u001a \u03bc\n\u2202 f (r)\n= \u2212q \u03bc f (q).\n(39)\nF\n\u2202r\u03bc\nWe can thus write\n\nB.\n\nFractional superdiffusive equation with\nevanescence\n\nIn the previous subsection we dealt with a waiting time\ndistribution with long tails together with a \"normal\" distribution of displacements, and the end result was a fractional subdiffusion equation. In this subsection we consider a \"normal\" waiting time distribution along with a\ndistribution of displacements that has long tails. This\nwill lead to a superdiffusive equation.\nWe thus consider a waiting time distribution with a\nfinite mean waiting time \u03c4 between steps, so that its\n\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202\u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0)\n= K \u03bc \u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0),\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\nwhere we have introduced the anomalous diffusion coefficient\nK=\n\n\u03c3\u03bc\n\u03c4\n\n(41)\n\nFor a one-dimensional system \u2202 \u03bc /\u2202r\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc /\u2202x\u03bc is the\nRiesz operator [10, 11, 12].\nUndoing the variable transformation (16), we finally\narrive at the fractional reaction-superdiffusion equation,\n\n\u2202w(r, t|r0 , 0)\n1\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u03c6\u0307(r, t)\n= \u03c6(r, t) K \u03bc\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) +\nw(r, t|r0 , 0).\n\u2202t\n\u2202r \u03c6(r, t)\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\nThis is the second important mesoscopic result of our\npaper, namely, the derivation of a reaction-superdiffusion\n\n(40)\n\nfractional equation starting from a CTRW.\n\n(42)\n\n\f7\nC.\n\nBifractional equation with evanescence\n\nFinally, in this subsection we combine subdiffusion and\nsuperdiffusion in that we choose a waiting time distribution that lacks finite moments (and thus leads to subdiffusion by itself) with a jump distance distribution that\nalso lacks moments (and thus leads to superdiffusion by\nitself). Our methodology directly lends itself to this combination.\nWe choose the waiting time distribution of Eq. (20)\nwhose Laplace transform is given in Eq. (21), and the\n\njump distribution Eq. (35) whose Fourier transform is\ngiven in Eq. (36). The steps to follow are now essentially\nthe same as in the previous sections, with appropriate\ncare given to the retention of the leading contributions.\nAfter some algebra we find\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202\u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0)\n= K 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b7(r, t|r0 , 0).\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\nUndoing the variable transformation (16), we finally obtain the fractional reaction-sub/super-diffusion equation,\n\n1\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u03c6\u0307(r, t)\n\u2202w(r, t|r0 , 0)\n= \u03c6(r, t) K 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b3 \u03bc\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) +\nw(r, t|r0 , 0).\n\u2202t\n\u2202r \u03c6(r, t)\n\u03c6(r, t)\n\nThis is our third mesoscopic result and is unique in that it\ncombines both subdiffusion and superdiffusion in a single\nequation.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this paper we have approached the problem of describing the evolution equation of particles that move in\na medium in which they can also die in a medium as they\nmove. The model is based on a CTRW description of the\nmotion of the particles. The motion may be anomalous\n(subdiffusive or superdiffusive) and the particles may die\nat a rate that can depend on position as well as time. We\nare able to capture the models that have been explicitly\nconsidered in the literature, e.g., the space-independent\nexponential evanescence model of Refs. [3] and [8], but\nour model can also capture complicated position dependences of the evanescent behavior such as that of the\nmodel of Fedotov [14] that render the problem nonlinear.\nWe confirm in a more general way than had been established previously the known result that the interplay\nof the (anomalous) motion and the evanescence is quite\ncomplex and that in general it can not be represented\nas the sum of two processes the way it can in normal\nreaction-diffusion scenarios. Having said this, we note\nas an aside that in certain cases (e.g., that of evanescence at a constant rate r = k) it is possible to reduce\nthe reaction-subdiffusion problem to a pure subdiffusion\nproblem by a proper transformation [14], much in the\nspirit of Danckwerts' solution for the problem of classical\ndiffusion with a linear reaction [15].\nWe started by constructing an integral equation for the\nprobability density of finding a (surviving) particle at a\nlocation r at time t given that it stepped on location r0 at\ntime t = 0. To proceed from this CTRW-based equation\nto the fractional equations, we found it necessary to make\nsome specific assumptions about the form of the rate of\n\n(43)\n\n(44)\n\nevanescence. The kernel of the integral equation under\nthese conditions is simply related to the single-step jump\nprobability density of the underlying CTRW. In spite of\nthe constraints, our models include as special cases all the\nexplicit models that have been presented in the literature.\nAll those, case by case [3, 8, 14], have been presented with\nvery specific physical contexts in mind.\nOnce we have arrived at an integral equation, the\nderivation of various fractional diffusion equations relies\non fairly standard procedures dictated by the form of the\nsingle-step probability properties, except that we have\nadded evanescence to the picture and are thus able to see\nthe complex interplay of motion and evanescence, at least\nunder our assumptions. Eventually we hope to be able to\nrelax some of our more stringent assumptions. We also\nhope to be able to include other particle loss mechanisms\nsuch as bimolecular reactions in our scheme, possibly at\nthe expense of introducing some kind of mean-field assumption to deal with the complexity arising from effects\nof cooperativity. The existing formalism can be adapted\nto some situations where instead of evanescence we have\nparticle sources, or perhaps sources and sinks simultaneously. However, in some cases particle sources require\nspecial scrutiny. For example, special care is needed when\ndealing with particles that give rise to offspring because\none must specify the rules surrounding the location and\ntime of creation of new particles, especially when dealing with jump and waiting time distributions that have\nlong tails. These are all plans for future work. Our most\nimmediate plans are to apply our results to the problem\nof the survival probability of a target that is surrounded\nby a d-dimensional sea of evanescent traps whose motion\nmay be subdiffusive if the waiting times for motion are\ntoo long, or superdiffusive if the jumps are sufficiently\nlong, or a mixture of both.\nFinally, we end with an interesting observation that\ndoes not appear obvious. One might, instead of Eq. (14),\nhave been motivated to write the integral equation\n\n\f8\n\nw(r, t|r0 , 0) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\ndr\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 \u03a8(r\u2032 \u2212 r0 , t\u2032 )\u039e(r\u2032 , r0 ; t\u2032 , 0)w(r, t|r\u2032 , t\u2032 ) + \u03a6(t)\u039e(r0 , r0 ; t, 0)\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ).\n\n(45)\n\n0\n\nAgain in the language of Hughes [13], this corresponds\nto a \"partition over the first step.\" What is interesting is\nthat we are not able to arrive at any reasonable fractional\ndiffusion equation starting from this integral equation, in\nany case not by the methods followed in this paper for\nEq. (14) even though one might have expected a certain\nsymmetry to the situation. This, too, is a question to be\nexplored further.\n\nimprovement.
