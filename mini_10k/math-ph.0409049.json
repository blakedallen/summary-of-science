Examples of such methods include [2], [3],[6]. It is proved in this paper\nthat the methods, proposed in the above papers, have essential difficulties. This also is\ndemonstrated by numerical experiments. Although it is true that f 6\u2208 R(B) when z 6\u2208 D,\nit turns out that in any neighborhood of f , however small, there are elements from R(B).\nAlso, although f \u2208 R(B) when z \u2208 D, there are elements in every neighborhood of f ,\n\n\fhowever small, which do not belong to R(B) even if z \u2208 D. Therefore it is not possible\nto construct a stable numerical method for identification of D based on checking the\ninclusions f 6\u2208 R(B) and f \u2208 R(B).\nWe prove below that the range R(B) is dense in the space L2 (S 2 ).\nAssumption (A): We assume throughout that k 2 is not a Dirichlet eigenvalue of the\nLaplacian in D.\nLet us introduce some notations: N(B) and R(B) are, respectively, the null-space and\nthe range of a linear operator B, D \u2208 R3 is a bounded domain (obstacle) with a smooth\nboundary S, D \u2032 = R3 \\ D, u0 = eik\u03b1*x , k = const > 0, \u03b1 \u2208 S 2 is a unit vector, N is the\n\u2032\neik|x\u2212y|\nunit normal to S pointing into D \u2032 , g = g(x, y, k) := g(|x \u2212 y|) := 4\u03c0|x\u2212y|\n, f := e\u2212ik\u03b1 *z ,\nwhere z \u2208 R3 and \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 S 2 , \u03b1\u2032 := xr \u22121 , r = |x|, u = u(x, \u03b1, k) is the scattering solution:\n(\u2206 + k 2 )u = 0 in D \u2032 , u|S = 0,\nu = u0 + v,\n\nv = A(\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b1, k)eikr r \u22121 + o(r \u22121 ),\n\n(1)\n\nas r \u2192 \u221e,\n\nxr \u22121 = \u03b1\u2032 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A := A(\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b1, k) is called the scattering amplitude, corresponding to the obstacle\nD and the Dirichlet boundary condition. Let G = G(x, y, k) be the resolvent kernel of\nthe Dirichlet Laplacian in D \u2032 :\n(\u2206 + k 2 )G = \u2212\u03b4(x \u2212 y) in D \u2032 , G|S = 0,\nand G satisfies the outgoing radiation condition.\nIf\n(\u2206 + k 2 )w = 0 in D \u2032 ,\n\nw|S = h,\n\nand w satisfies the radiation condition, then ([7]) one has\nZ\nw(x) =\nGN (x, s)h(s)ds, w = a(\u03b1\u2032 , k)eikr r \u22121 + o(r \u22121 ),\nS\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nas r \u2192 \u221e,\n\nxr \u22121 = \u03b1\u2032 .\n(5)\n\nWe write a(\u03b1\u2032 ) for a(\u03b1\u2032 , k), and\n1\na(\u03b1 ) := Bh :=\n4\u03c0\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nS\n\nuN (s, \u2212\u03b1\u2032 )h(s)ds,\n\n(6)\n\nas follows from Ramm's lemma:\nLemma 1 ([7], p.46) One has:\nG(x, y, k) = g(r)u(y, \u2212\u03b1\u2032, k) + o(r \u22121 ),\n\nas r = |x| \u2192 \u221e,\n\nwhere u is the scattering solution (1)-(2).\nOne can write the scattering amplitude as:\nZ\n1\n\u2032\nuN (s, \u2212\u03b1\u2032 )eik\u03b1*s ds.\nA(\u03b1 , \u03b1, k) = \u2212\n4\u03c0 S\n2\n\nxr \u22121 = \u03b1\u2032 ,\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe following claim is proved in [6]:\n\u2032\nClaim: f := e\u2212ik\u03b1 *z \u2208 R(B) if and only if z \u2208 D.\nProof of the claim. Our proof is based on the results in [7].\na) Let us assume that f = Bh, i.e.,\nR f \u2208 R(B), and prove that z \u2208 D. Define\np(y) := g(y, z) \u2212 \u03c8(y), where \u03c8(y) := S GN (s, y)h(s)ds. The function p(y) solves the\n1\nHelmholtz equation (4) in the region |y| > |z| and p(y) = o( |y|\n) as |y| \u2192 \u221e because of\n(7) and of the relation Bh = f . Therefore (see [7], p.25) p = 0 in the region |y| > |z|.\nSince \u03c8 is bounded in D \u2032 and g(y, z) \u2192 \u221e as y \u2192 z, we get a contradiction unless z \u2208 D.\nThus, f \u2208 R(B) implies z \u2208 D.\nR\nb) Let us prove that z \u2208 D implies f \u2208 R(B). Define \u03c8(y) := S GN (s, y)g(s, z)ds,\nand h := g(s, z). Then, by Green's formula, one has \u03c8(y) = g(y, z). Taking here |y| \u2192 \u221e,\ny\n= \u03b1\u2032 , and using (7), one gets f = Bh, so f \u2208 R(B). The claim is proved. \u2737\n|y|\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nConsider\nR B : L\u2032 (S) \u2192 L (S ), and A : L (S ) \u2192 L (S ), where B is defined in (6)\nand Aq := S 2 A(\u03b1 , \u03b1)q(\u03b1)d\u03b1.\nTheorem 1. The ranges R(B) and R(A) are dense in L2 (S 2 ).\nProof. Recall that assumption (A) holds.\nIt is sufficient to prove that N(B \u2217 ) = {0}\nR\nand N(A\u2217 ) = {0}. Assume 0 = B \u2217 q = S 2 uN (s, \u2212\u03b1\u2032 )qd\u03b1\u2032 , where the overline stands\nfor complex\nconjugate. Taking complex conjugate\nand denoting q by q again, one gets\nR\nR\n\u2032\n\u2032\n0 = S 2 uN (s, \u2212\u03b1 )qd\u03b1 . Define w(x) := S 2 u(x, \u2212\u03b1\u2032 )qd\u03b1\u2032. Then w = wN = 0 on\nS, and w solves equation (1) in D \u2032 . By the uniqueness of the solution to the Cauchy\nproblem,\n= 0 in D \u2032 . Let us derive\nR w \u2212ik\u03b1\nR from this\u2032 that q \u2032 = 0. One has w = w0 + V , where\n\u2032 *x\n\u2032\nw0 := S 2 e\nqd\u03b1 , and V := S 2 v(x, \u2212\u03b1 , k)qd\u03b1 satisfies the radiation condition.\nTherefore, w0 (x) = 0 in D \u2032 , as follows from Lemma 2 proved below. By the unique\ncontinuation, w0 (x) = 0 in R3 , and this implies q = 0 by the injectivity of the Fourier\ntransform. This proves the first statement of Theorem 1. Its second statement is proved\nbelow. \u2737\nLet us now prove Lemma 2, mentioned above.\nWe keep the notations used in the above proof.\nLemma 2. If w = w0 + V = 0 in D \u2032 , then w0 = 0 in D \u2032 .\nProof. The idea of the proof is simple: since w0 does not satisfy the radiation\ncondition, and V satisfies it, one concludes that w0 = 0. Let us give the details. The key\nformula is ([7], p.54):\nZ\n1\n2\u03c0i\neik\u03b1*\u03b2r q(\u03b2)d\u03b2 =\n[\u03b3q(\u2212\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b3q(\u03b1)] + o( ), r \u2192 \u221e,\n(9)\nk\nr\nS2\nwhere \u03b3 := eikr /r, and one assumes q \u2208 C 1 (S 2 ).\nIf r := |x| \u2192 \u221e, then, by Lemma 2, assuming q \u2208 C 1 (S 2 ), and using the relation\nw = w0 + V = 0 in D \u2032 , one gets q(\u03b1) = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 S 2 . Thus, Lemma 2 is proved\nunder the additional assumption q \u2208 C 1 (S 2 ). If q \u2208 L2 (S 2 ), then one uses a similar\nargument in a weak sense, i.e., with x := r\u03b2, one considers the inner product in L2 (S 2 )\nof w0 (r\u03b2) and a smooth test function h \u2208 C \u221e (S 2 ), and applies Lemma 2 to the function\n3\n\n\fR\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212ik\u03b1 *\u03b2r hd\u03b2. Then, using arbitrariness of h, one concludes that q = 0 as an element\nof L2 (S 2 ). Lemma 2 is proved. \u2737.\nLet us prove the second statement of Theorem 1.\nAssume now that A\u2217 q = 0. Taking complex conjugate, and using the reciprocity\nrelation: A(\u03b1, \u03b2) = A(\u2212\u03b2, \u2212\u03b1), one gets an equation:\nZ\nA(\u03b1, \u03b2)hd\u03b2 = 0,\n(10)\nS2\n\nS2\n\nR\nwhere\nh = q(\u2212\u03b2). Define\nR ik\u03b2*x\nR w(x) := S 2 u(x, \u03b2)hd\u03b2. Then w = w0 + V , where w0 :=\ne\nhd\u03b2, and V := S 2 v(x, \u03b2)hd\u03b2 satisfies the radiation condition. Equation (10)\nS2\nimplies that V = o( 1r ) as r \u2192 \u221e. Since function V solves equation (1) and V = o( 1r ),\none concludes (see [7], p.25), that V = 0 in D \u2032 , so that w = w0 in D \u2032 . Thus, w0 |S =\nw|S = 0. Since w0 solves equation (1) in D and w0 |S = 0, one gets, using Assumption\n(A), that w0 = 0 in D. This and the unique continuation property imply w0 = 0 in R3 .\nConsequently, h = 0, so q = 0, as claimed. Theorem 1 is proved. \u2737\nRemark 1. In [2] the 2D inverse obstacle scattering problem is considered. It is\nproposed to solve the equation (1.9) in [2]:\nZ\nA(\u03b1, \u03b2)Gd\u03b2 = e\u2212ik\u03b1*z ,\n(11)\nS1\n\nwhere A is the scattering amplitude at a fixed k > 0, S 1 is the unit circle, and z is a\npoint on R2 . If G = G(\u03b2, z) is found, the boundary S of the obstacle is to be found by\nfinding those z for which ||G|| := ||G(\u03b2, z)||L2(S 1 ) is maximal. Assuming that k 2 is not a\nDirichlet or Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplacian in D, that D is a smooth, bounded,\nsimply connected domain, the authors state Theorem 2.1 [2], p.386, which says that for\nevery \u01eb > 0 there exists a function G \u2208 L2 (S 1 ), such that\nlim ||G(\u03b2, z)|| = \u221e,\n\nz\u2192S\n\nand ( see [2], p.386),\n||\n\nZ\n\nS1\n\nA(\u03b1, \u03b2)Gd\u03b2 \u2212 e\u2212ik\u03b1*z || < \u01eb.\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nThere are several questions concerning the proposed method.\nFirst, equation (11), in general, is not solvable. The authors propose to solve it\napproximately, by a regularization method. The regularization method applies for stable\nsolution of solvable ill-posed equations (with exact or noisy data). If equation (11) is not\nsolvable, it is not clear what numerical \"solution\" one seeks by a regularization method.\nSecondly, since the kernel of the integral operator in (11) is smooth, one can always\nfind, for any z \u2208 R2 , infinitely many G with arbitrary large ||G||, such that (13) holds.\nTherefore it is not clear how and why, using (12), one can find S numerically by the\nproposed method.\n4\n\n\fRemark 2. In [2], p.386, Theorem 2.1, it is claimed that for every \u01eb > 0 and every\ny0 \u2208 D there exists a function G such that inequality (13) (which is (2.8) on p.386 of [2])\nholds and ||G|| \u2192 \u221e as y0 \u2192 \u2202D. Such a G is used in [2] in a \"simple method for solving\ninverse scattering problem\". However, in fact there exist infinitely many G such that\ninequality (13) holds and ||G|| \u2192 \u221e, regardless of where y0 is. Therefore it is not clear\nhow one can use the method proposed in [2] for solving the inverse scattering problem\nwith any degree of confidence in the result.\nRemark 3. In [1] it is mentioned that the methods (called LSM-linear sampling\nmethods) proposed in papers [3], [2], [6] produce numerically results which are inferior to\nthese obtained by linearized Born-type inversion. There is no guarantee of any accuracy\nin recovery of the obstacle by LSM. Therefore it is of interest to experiment numerically\nwith other inversion methods. In [7], p.94, (see also [8],[11],[12]) a method (SFM-support\nfunction method) is proposed for recovery of strictly convex obstacles from the scattering\namplitude. This method allows one to recover the support function of the obstacle, and\nthe boundary of the obstacle is obtained from this function explicitly. Error estimates of\nthis method are obtained for the case when the data are noisy [7], p.104. The method is\nasymptotically exact for large wavenumbers, but it works numerically even for ka \u223c 1,\nas shown in [5]. For the Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions this method\nallows one to recover the support function without a priori knowledge of the boundary\ncondition. If the obstacle is not convex, the method recovers the convex hull of the\nobstacle. Numerically one can recover the obstacle, after its convex hull is found, by\nusing Modified Rayleigh conjecture method, introduced in [10], or by a parameter-fitting\nmethod.\nIn [13] there is a formula for finding an acoustically soft obstacle from the fixedfrequency scattering data. It is an open problem to develop an algorithm based on this\nformula.\nA numerical implementation of the Linear Sampling Method (LSM), suggested in [2],\nconsists of solving a discretized version of\nZ\nA(\u03b1, \u03b2)Gd\u03b2 = e\u2212ik\u03b1*z ,\n(14)\nS1\n\nwhere A is the scattering amplitude at a fixed k > 0, S 1 is the unit circle, \u03b1 \u2208 S 1 , and z\nis a point on R2 .\nLet F = {A\u03b1i , \u03b2j }, i = 1, ..., N, j = 1, ..., N be the square matrix formed by the\nmeasurements of the scattering amplitude for N incoming, and N outgoing directions.\nthen the discretized version of (14) is\nF g = f,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the vector f is formed by\n\u03c0\n\nei 4 \u2212ik\u03b1n *z\nfn = \u221a\ne\n,\n8\u03c0k\n5\n\nn = 1, ..., N,\n\n(16)\n\n\fsee [1] for details.\nDenote the Singular Value Decomposition of the far field operator by F = USV H .\nLet sn be the singular values of F , \u03c1 = U H f, and \u03bc = V H f. Then the norm of the sought\nfunction g is given by\nN\nX\n|\u03c1n |2\n2\nkGk =\n.\n(17)\ns2n\nn=1\nA different LSM is suggested by A. Kirsch in [6]. In it one solves\n(F \u2217 F )1/4 g = f\n\n(18)\n\ninstead of (15). The corresponding expression for the norm of G is\n2\n\nkGk =\n\nN\nX\n|\u03bcn |2\nn=1\n\nsn\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nA detailed numerical comparison of the two LSMs and the linearized tomographic inverse\nscattering is given in [1].\nThe conclusions of [1], as well as of our own numerical experiments are that the\nmethod of Kirsch (19) gives a better, but a comparable identification, than (17). The\nidentification is significantly deteriorating if the scattering amplitude is available only\nfor a limited aperture, or if the data are corrupted by noise. Also, the points with the\nsmallest values of the kGk are the best in locating the inclusion, and not the largest one,\nas required by the theory in [6] and in [2]. In Figures 1 and 2 the implementation of the\nColton-Kirsch LSM (17) is denoted by gnck, and of the Kirsch method (19) by gnk. The\nFigures show a contour plot of the logarithm of the kGk. The original obstacle consisted\nof two circles of radius 1.0 centered at the points (\u2212d, 0.0) and (d, 0.0). The results\nof the identification for d = 2.0 are shown in Figure 1, and the results for d = 1.5 are\nshown in Figure 2. Note that the actual radius of the circles is 1.0, but it cannot be\nseen from the LSM identification. Also, one cannot determine the separation between\nthe circles, nor their shapes. Still, the methods are fast, they locate the obstacles,\nand do not require any knowledge of the boundary conditions on the obstacle. The\nSupport Function Method ([5], [7]) showed a better identification for the convex parts of\nobstacles. Its generalization for unknown boundary conditions is discussed in [14]. The\nLSM identification was performed for the scattering amplitude of the obstacles computed\nby the Boundary Integral Equations method, see [4]. No noise was added to the synthetic\ndata. In all the experiments we used k = 1.0, and N = 60.\n\nReferences\n[1] Brandfass, M., Lanterman, A., Warnick, K., A comparison of the Colton-Kirsch\ninverse scattering methods with linearized tomographic inverse scattering, Inverse\nProblems 17, (2001), 1797-1816\n6\n\n\fgnk, k=1.0, d=2.0\n8.60753\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n-2.89727\n-4 -2 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\ngnck, k=1.0, d=2.0\n20.7297\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n2.34478\n-4 -2 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 1: Identification of two circles of radius 1.0 centered at (\u2212d, 0.0) and (d, 0.0) for\nd = 2.0.\n\n7\n\n\fgnk, k=1.0, d=1.5\n9.25278\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n-2.87834\n-4 -2 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\ngnck, k=1.0, d=1.5\n24.8328\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n5.73788\n-4 -2 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: Identification of two circles of radius 1.0 centered at (\u2212d, 0.0) and (d, 0.0) for\nd = 1.5.\n\n8\n\n\f[2] Colton, D., Kirsch, A., A simple method for solving inverse scattering problems in\nthe resonance region, Inverse Problems 12 (1996), 383\u2013393\n[3] Colton, D., Coyle, J., Monk, P., Recent developments in inverse acoustic scattering\ntheory, SIAM Rev. 42 (2000), no. 3, 369\u2013414\n[4] Colton D., Kress R.
