The session on precision studies of electroweak interactions is summarized.\nThe contributions address the bilinear, trilinear, quartic as well as heavy-quark interactions of the electroweak gauge bosons. This makes up a picture of the physics\nof electroweak symmetry and symmetry breaking which can be investigated with the\nproposed design of e+ e\u2212 Linear Colliders and detectors.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe precise study of electroweak interactions has now become a classical domain\nof e+ e\u2212 physics, with a wealth of useful data available from the LEP and SLD\nexperiments [1]. Nevertheless, with the upstart of data-taking at a high-energy\nand high-luminosity Linear Collider, a new level of precision will be accessible,\nsetting unprecedented requirements both on the experimental analysis and on the\naccuracy of theoretical predictions.\nThe success of the Standard Model (SM) in explaining electroweak data establishes the nonabelian SU2 \u00d7 U1 gauge theory as a firm theoretical basis. Even in\nthe absence of a light Higgs boson, the subset of the SM which incorporates only\nthe known fermions and vector bosons serves as a useful effective theory valid up\nto the TeV energy range [2]. This sets the framework for the interpretation of\nprecision data: Any deviation from the standard predictions can be parameterized\nby gauge-invariant operators of higher dimension in the electroweak Lagrangian\n(anomalous couplings). Only if there are striking signals such as the appearance\nof new particles, the SM effective-theory description must be abandoned in some\nsector of the theory and a new model placed there instead. Such scenarios are\ndiscussed in the reports on Supersymmetry [3] and on Alternative Theories [4] in\nthese proceedings.\n\n\fThe Task & the Challenge\nIf models of electroweak symmetry breaking and physics beyond the SM are\nto be disentangled by their indirect effects on anomalous couplings, a complete\ncoverage of electroweak interactions is essential. All bilinear, trilinear and quartic\nself-couplings of gauge bosons as well as their interactions with fermions should be\nmeasured as precisely as possible.\nFortunately, the contributions which have been presented at this Workshop (and\nwhich will be summarized below) show that all of the entries in this list are being\naddressed, leading to the generic conclusion that such a program is in fact feasible\nat a Linear Collider.\nTo get an impression of the expected magnitude of deviations from the SM predictions, one may consider a scenario in which no light Higgs boson exists and\nthe W and Z bosons (their longitudinal modes, to be exact) become strongly interacting at TeV energies. In this case, the SM, lacking the Higgs particle as a\nregulator, predicts observables only to leading order in an expansion in powers\nof the energy [2]. At next-to-leading order (NLO) a certain number of new unknown parameters enter the game which in a consistent picture must be at least\ncomparable to the size of one-loop radiative corrections [5]:\n1\n= 0.0063\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(1)\n\nThis factor, essentially geometric in origin, is also quite typical for other scenarios\nwhich include a light Higgs boson: In this case, many new-physics effects decouple,\nand their presence can only be felt by finite loop corrections in SM interactions,\nwhich are again suppressed by the magic number 1/16\u03c0 2 .\nEven though this conclusion may be pessimistic, without further knowledge of\nthe underlying theory of electroweak symmetry breaking one has to be prepared\nfor measuring all relevant interactions at the percent level or even better. This is\na challenge for experiments, theory and simulation tools. One has to:\n\u2022 Measure the observables with percent accuracy. Clearly, this requires a high\nluminosity of the machine: For a relative deviation as small as 1/16\u03c0 2 to be a\none-sigma effect, one needs at least 25, 000 signal events in a certain channel.\nThis problem can be partly overcome by a higher c.m. energy since the effects\nof anomalous couplings on observables typically increase with energy.\n\u2022 Predict the signal to better than percent accuracy. The SM amplitudes have\nto be known with radiative corrections incorporated. Even NLO predictions\nare not always sufficient. In particular for multi-particle final states, this is\nstill a long way to go.\n\u2022 Understand the background to better than percent accuracy. Although the\nsignal-to-background ratio in the e+ e\u2212 environment is much more favorable\n\n\fthan in hadronic collisions, this still demands the inclusion of complete matrix elements with leading radiative corrections and the exact treatment of\nmulti-particle phase space in Monte Carlo generators. The large number and\ncomplexity of the processes to be considered clearly calls for flexible and automatic solutions.\n\nThe Big If\nWhile the requirements on the accuracy of the experimental analysis and the\ntheoretical prediction are independent of the scenario of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking realized in Nature, the interpretation of actual experimental results will\nnot:\n\u2022 If a light Higgs boson exists (a fact that can be checked with confidence at\na Linear Collider, if not elsewhere), in practical terms the SM is a complete\nrenormalizable theory.1 Measuring electroweak interactions probes the structure of the non-abelian symmetry, and deviations would give only indirect hints\nfor extensions or the breakdown of the picture: extra matter, extra gauge interactions, extra dimensions, or effects we do not even think of at present.\nHowever, although such new physics seems to be associated with any attempt\nto reconcile the strong and electroweak interactions with gravity, the theory\ndoes not really require it up to energy scales which are probably inaccessible\nto any collider.\n\u2022 On the other hand, if no light Higgs boson exists, we are lacking a straightforward explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking. The mechanism responsible for it should manifest itself in the interactions of the particles which are\nmost strongly coupled to the symmetry-breaking sector, namely the massive\nelectroweak gauge bosons and the heavy top and bottom quarks. Precise measurements of their properties and interactions would then play the key role in\nuncovering the underlying theory which could explain, at least, the presence\nof gauge boson and fermion masses, and possibly shed light on the origin of\nflavor physics as a whole.\n\nBILINEAR INTERACTIONS\nIn the Higgs-less scenario, it is customary to express corrections to the bilinear\ninteractions of electroweak gauge bosons in terms of three parameters (e.g., S, T\nand U [7]) which incorporate the leading effects in a low-energy expansion up to\ndimension four. These parameters can be identified with the coefficients of bilinear\ngauge-invariant operators [2]. Similarly, in the light-Higgs scenario deviations from\n1)\n\nWith the current lower limit on the Higgs mass, the vacuum instability bound of the SM is\nwell beyond the reach of colliders [6].\n\n\fthe SM predictions are parameterized to leading order by gauge-invariant operators\nof dimension six [8].\nIn any case, these parameters quantify modifications in the way the physical W ,\nZ and photon fields are related to the proper SU2 \u00d7 U1 gauge fields. This would\nbe visible in deviations from the tree-level prediction for the W and Z masses in\nterms of low-energy parameters (the Fermi coupling, the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant and the weak mixing angle):\nMW =\n\ne \u221a\n( 2 GF )\u22121/2\nsin \u03b8w\n\nand MW = cos \u03b8w MZ\n\n(2)\n\nSuch deviations are caused by matter carrying both SU2 and U1 quantum numbers [7] and by violations of the custodial SU2c isospin symmetry [9] which in the\nSM relates the right-handed up- and down-type fermions. Radiative corrections\nwithin the SM also affect these relations.\nAt LEP1 and SLC, the high cross section on the Z resonance allowed for a test of\nthe relations (2) which is precise enough that SM loop corrections have to be taken\ninto account. There is little hope to improve on this by measurements at higher\nenergies unless one encounters a new resonance in e+ e\u2212 scattering. However, by\nexploiting the high-luminosity capability of the Linear Collider on the Z resonance\nagain, a new level of precision is accessible. This Giga-Z option is reviewed by\nK. M\u00f6nig [10]. (See also [11,12] for experimental issues at Giga-Z. The impact of\nthis option for b physics is further discussed in [13].)\nOne should note that with the experimental accuracy achievable at Giga-Z, there\nis need for the inclusion of two-loop (NNLO) corrections in the theoretical prediction [14]. In terms of the effective-theory approach this means that operators of\nNNLO in the low-energy expansion have to be included as well, and the description\nin terms of three parameters (like S, T , U) is no longer adequate.\nWithin the context of a definite model such as the SM or its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM), S. Heinemeyer [14] shows how to turn this argument\naround: Deviations from the relations (2) determine extra unknown parameters of\nthe model which are difficult to access directly. For example, the parameters of the\nstop sector of the MSSM can be read off the electroweak observables if all other\nrelevant quantities are assumed to be known.\n\nTRILINEAR INTERACTIONS\nIn e+ e\u2212 collisions, trilinear interactions of electroweak gauge bosons affect fourfermion production. Depending on the assumed physical scenario (with or without\nHiggs) and the assumed underlying symmetry (electromagnetic gauge invariance,\nCP invariance, custodial symmetry) the number of independent parameters which\ngovern the triple gauge couplings of W , Z bosons and photons at NLO vary between two and fourteen [2,15]. Improving on the bounds obtained at the LEP2\n\n\fexperiments, a high-energy Linear Collider will lift the state of knowledge of the\ntrilinear anomalous couplings to the level of the bilinear couplings right now.\nIn the study by Wolfgang Menges [16] this fact is verified in a refined analysis\nof e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 4f , which takes into account initial-state radiation, beamstrahlung, beam polarization and detector effects, and uses the full spin correlation\nin the final state to extract the anomalous couplings from simulated event samples.\nThe precision achievable is of the order 10\u22124 for the \"standard\" couplings and of\nthe order 10\u22123 for the CP-violating ones, reaching and even surpassing the magic\nnumber 1/16\u03c0 2.\nA meaningful measurement of four-fermion production at this level of accuracy\nrequires a theoretical understanding of this process which has not yet been fully\nachieved. In their respective contributions, W. Placzek [17] and D. Wackeroth [18]\nreview the current status of the four-fermion Monte-Carlo generators YFSWW/KORALW\nand RACOONWW. They incorporate the resummation of multiple photon radiation in\nthe initial state beyond the leading-logarithmic level. In addition, genuine electroweak loop corrections are taken into account. Since a full one-loop calculation\nis not yet available, all generators rely on the so-called double-pole approximation for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f , which incorporates all radiative corrections at NLO near\nthe doubly-resonant kinematic configuration. The technical agreement of the two\ncodes is satisfactory, and the LEP2 data are accurately described by the simulation. However, regarding the experimental prospects at a Linear Collider, the level\nof accuracy is only barely sufficient, and improvements in the theoretical prediction\nare still needed.\n\u221a\nWith increasing collider energy a new scale discrepancy of s vs. MW , MZ\ncomplicates the calculation of radiative corrections. At ultra-high energies Sudakovtype logarithms of such scale ratios pile up, invalidating finite-order predictions and\ncalling for new methods of resummation. Fortunately, as shown by M. Melles [19],\nthese contributions are under control: they factorize and exponentiate and can thus\nbe absorbed into universal correction factors.\nIf no light Higgs boson exists, a conceivable side-effect of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is a heavy vector resonance in W W scattering [20,21]. This would mix\nwith the Z boson, leading to an effective form factor in the ZW W coupling. As\npointed out by T. Barklow [22], if anomalous triple gauge couplings are interpreted\nin this way, the presence of such a vector resonance with a mass as high as 2.5 TeV\ncould easily be detected in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4f . Here, due to the s-channel nature of the\nprocess, high luminosity at lower energy (500 fb\u22121 at 800 GeV) is more promising\nthan lower luminosity at higher energy (200 fb\u22121 at 1.5 TeV).\nThe measurement of W pair production and the disentangling of the various\ncouplings is greatly simplified by charm tagging, which removes ambiguities in\nprocesses with W decaying into hadrons. This possibility is being investigated in\nthe present context by W. Walkowiak [23].\n\n\fQUARTIC INTERACTIONS\nThe study of quartic vector boson interactions has not been possible at any\nexisting collider, and the Linear Collider in conjunction with the LHC will play\na pioneer role [24,25]. These interactions are particularly interesting since in the\nabsence of a scalar resonance (the Higgs boson) the scattering amplitudes for the\nprocesses W W \u2192 W W and W W \u2192 ZZ become strong in the TeV range, violating\ntree-level unitarity [26] and thus calling for new physical effects which regulate the\nhigh-energy behavior.\nConversely, if the Higgs exists, there would be a strong cancellation in this class\nof processes which would be interesting to observe directly: the Higgs mechanism\nat work.\nThe processes W W \u2192 W W and W W \u2192 ZZ are accessible at a Linear Collider\nas subprocesses of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bd + 4f (and e\u2212 e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd + 4f ), where the \"initial\" W\nbosons are radiated off the incoming electron/positron. While at ultra-high energies\nthis effect can be described by an effective structure-function approach [27], at\nLinear Collider energies of the order 0.5 . . . 1 TeV this is not sufficient, and complete\nmatrix elements should be used for a reliable calculation. Therefore, the analysis\npresented by R. Chierici [28] uses the new generic Monte-Carlo package WHIZARD [29]\nto simulate the complete six-fermion signal without such approximations.\nThe difficulty here is threefold: First, W W and ZZ states must be clearly separated from each other using their hadronic decays. Second, a large background\nfrom the subprocesses \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W W and \u03b3W \u2192 ZW where the electron radiating\nthe photon vanishes in the beampipe must be reduced. Finally, anomalous quartic\ncouplings primarily affect the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the vector bosons,\nwhich should be extracted from appropriate angular correlations. \u221a\nThe\nanalysis shows that for the second-stage TESLA parameters s = 800 GeV\nR\nand L = 1 ab\u22121 a meaningful measurement is in fact possible. Assuming for\nsimplicity CP invariance and exact custodial symmetry, which reduces the dimensionality of the NLO parameter space to two, the remaining anomalous couplings \u03b14\nand \u03b15 can be measured with an accuracy of the order 10\u22122 . This already comes\nnear the magic number 1/16\u03c0 2. Beam polarization and the inclusion of further\nobservables in the analysis further improve this result.\nObviously, going to even higher energies is another option for increasing the\nimpact of new effects in W W scattering\u221aon observables. A. de Roeck [30] demonstrates the power of a CLIC design with s = 3 TeV to disentangle various possible\nscenarios for the high-energy behavior of this process.\n\nELECTROWEAK TOP QUARK INTERACTIONS\nRecent theoretical developments have shown that the heaviness of the top quark\n(or, equivalently, the lightness of all other fermions) may indicate its direct involvement in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking [31]. It is therefore\n\n\fimportant to look also into processes like W + W \u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304, another interaction that\nbecomes strong at high energies if not regulated by a Higgs-like resonance.\nAlthough the larger top mass makes it more difficult, W W \u2192 tt (and W Z \u2192 tb)\nscattering can be accessed by methods similar to elastic vector boson scattering.\nT. Han [32] and J. Alcaraz [33] present studies which investigate the possibility to\nobserve resonances in these channels. As a result, the detection of resonances with\na mass up to 2/3 of the collider energy seems feasible.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA Linear Collider with an energy in the 0.5 . . . 1 TeV range will provide an\nappropriate environment to measure electroweak interactions with such a precision\nthat one can not only check the overall consistency of the gauge theory, but be\nsensitive to the physics that lies at the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking.\nHowever, to reach the necessary high level of accuracy, strong requirements on the\nmachine, the detector, the analysis, and on theory must be fulfilled. Many details\nhave yet to be clarified and work still needs to be done, but as the contributions\npresented at this Workshop have shown, this program is realistic.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank the participants of the Electroweak Working Group for\nstimulating discussions, and the organizers for their invitation and for the pleasant\natmosphere at this meeting.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
