We investigate the dynamics of spontaneous or triggered cavitation inside water filled microcavities of a hydrogel. Results show that\na stable bubble is created in only a microsecond timescale, after transient oscillations. Then, a\ndiffusion driven expansion leads to filling of the cavity. Analysis reveals that the nucleation of a\nbubble releases a tension of several tens of MPa, and a simple model captures the different time\nscales of the expansion process.\n\nThe dynamics of cavitation is a well studied process\nin free liquids (cavitation in the wake of propellers for\ninstance), while cavitation in a microscopic confinement\nonly recently received more attention. One important\narea of research is the transport of sap in trees and the\npotential blockage of this transport due to cavitation:\nthese events can stop circulation of water in the vessels\nof real trees1,2 , or in synthetic ones that are used for\nmicrofluidic flow transport driven by evaporation3\u20135 .\nThe stability of water at negative pressure, i.e. under\ntension (see6 for a review), can be tested with hydrogels\nwhere the tension is fixed through the relative humidity\nof the surrounding medium3,7 . However, such a method\nfeatures only the final equilibrium state, and does not\nreveal about the cavitation process itself. The dynamics\nof cavitation involves fast time scales that are not known,\napart from the fact that they are suspected to generate\nvibrations (noises in trees8 ).\nIn this study we resolve the dynamics of cavitation\nof water inside hydrogel cavities. Cavitation can occur\nspontaneously or be triggered by a disturbance created by\na laser pulse. The dynamics of the nucleated bubble and\nhydrogel cavity are recorded with a high-speed camera\nor a photodiode.\nWe use pHEMA hydrogels of the same chemical composition as in3,7 , but with a periodic array of holes or cavities, created using the novel experimental setup shown\nin Fig. 1a. An Nd:YAG laser (\u03bb = 532 nm, tp = 6 ns)\nis coupled to an inverted microscope. The laser pulses\nare focused by a 40x water immersion microscope objective inside a thin layer of partially polymerized hydrogel\nthat has been precured with UV light (dimensions \u223c 1.5\n\u00d71.5 cm\u00d71 mm). The hydrogel sample is bounded by\ntwo microscope coverslides separated by PDMS spacers.\nA single cavity is created after a laser-induced optical\nbreakdown inside the hydrogel sample. The system is\ncoupled to an automated translation stage that allows\nthe design of a regular array of holes. The shape of the\ncavities strongly depends on the degree of polymerisation\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nmicroscope\ncondenser\nhydrogel\nobjective\n532 nm, 6ns\nlaser pulse\n\n100 \u03bcm\n\ndichroic\nmirrors\n\n(c)\n\nphotodiode\nhigh- speed\ncamera\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Experimental set-up. (b) Microcavities in the\nhydrogel created by laser pulses with low UV pre-curing, (c)\nMicrocavities when the hydrogel is pre-cured for a longer time.\n\nof the hydrogel: while they are smooth and spherical for\nlow pre-polymerisation, they tend to form \"cauliflower\"\nshapes when more cured (Fig. 1b,c), in a manner very\nsimilar to what is observed when forcing air in a polyacrylamide gel9 . Finally, the hydrogel is fully polymerized (Fig. 1b). To fill the the cavities with water, the\nhydrogel is boiled with water for a few days, and soaked\nin degazed DI water.\nAs the hydrogel samples are dried, water is set under tension because of evaporation. Cavitation spontaneously occurs when tension is strong enough, or can be\ndirectly triggered with laser pulses, focused in the hydrogel, in vicinity of water filled voids. The gel is sometimes\nslightly altered (apparition of grey spot, Fig. 2a). We\nspeculate that a mild pressure wave is created, travels\nover the microcavity and thereby increases the liquid tension for a brief moment. This mechanical disturbance in\nthe hydrogel is able to trigger cavitation in neighboring\nmicrocavities, if under tension. The dynamics of cavita-\n\n\f2\n\n\u2206p = Kl\n\n\u2206Vl\n.\nVl\n\n(1)\n\nWe performed this analysis for a total of thirteen bubbles, see Fig. 3, showing that the released pressure\namounts to values ranging within the tens of MPa range\n(30 MPa \u00b116 MPa). Due to the measurement error in\nthe image analysis, the estimated pressure presents a lot\nof uncertainty, but is comparable to that measured for\ncavitation in static hydrogels with the same composition\n(22 MPa)3,7 , and to other experimental methods6 . Note\nthat the pressure released by triggered cavitation is of\nthe same order than with spontaneous cavitation (Fig\n3d). Indeed, the laser perturbation is not very large, and\nin order to trigger cavitation we had to wait for the pressure to be close to the spontaneous threshold, i.e. when\ncavitation occurs spontaneously on nearby cavities.\n\n(a)\n\nbefore\n\n1.5 \u03bcs\n\n201.5 \u03bcs\n50 \u03bcm\n\n(b)\n\nbefore\n\n2.3 \u03bcs\n\n4.6 \u03bcs\n\n6.9 \u03bcs\n20 \u03bcm\n\n1\n\n\u0394I / I (%)\n\n(c)\nRb / Rb,0\n\ntion is recorded with a high-speed camera at frame rates\nof up to 432,000 frames per second, with an exposure\ntime of 1 \u03bcs. In addition, the central part of the image\ncan be projected simultaneously onto a photodiode with\na rise time of 0.03 \u03bcs and bandwidth of 12 MHz, providing a measurement of the mean intensity in order to\naccess faster dynamics.\nFast time scales Our recordings reveal that a single\nbubble is nucleated, and that its volume quickly reaches\na finite value, within 1 or 2 microseconds (Fig. 2a-c).\nWe captured the first image of the nucleated bubble after a delay of 1 \u03bcs after arrival of the laser pulse. If these\nimages are motion blurred due to the exposure time of\n1\u03bcs, they show a transient non-spherical shape, see second image of Fig 2b. On the photo-diode signal we record\ntransient high-frequency oscillations at typically several\nMHz, that we interpret as oscillations of the radius in Fig\n2c, with an initial velocity as fast as 30 m/s. We assumed\nthe variation in light intensity to be proportional to the\napparent bubble area on images.\nThe following images of the high-speed recording show\nthat the bubble after nucleation reaches a temporary\nequilibrium radius and then slowly grows. This is in\ncontrast to cavitation nucleation in a free liquid, where\nthe bubble expands to a maximum size and then rapidly\ncollapses due to the pressure of the surrounding liquid.\nExperiments with an observation from the side also evidence that bubbles rise due to their buoyancy (Fig. 2d),\nmeaning they are not attached by a contact line and are\nquickly spherical.\nThe instantaneous volume of the bubble (Vb ) and of\nthe cavity (Vc ) are obtained by extracting an effective\nradius from image analysis (Fig. 3), consisting in tracing iso-values lines on grey levels bitmaps. Interestingly,\nthe volume of liquid Vl = Vc \u2212 Vb,0 just after nucleation\ndecreases. This is due to the compressibility of water,\nwhich has an adiabatic bulk modulus15 Kl = 2.2 GPa\nat 20\u25e6 C. Therefore, the variation of liquid volume \u2206Vl\n(= \u2206Vc \u2212 Vb,0 ) gives information on the pressure change\n\u2206p in the liquid:\n\n2\n1.5\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nt (\u03bc s)\n\n6\n\n(d)\n\ng\n20 \u03bcm\n0 ms\n\n200 ms 400 ms\n\n600 ms\n\nFIG. 2: Image sequences showing the birth of a cavitation\nbubble (a) triggered by a laser pulse aimed away from microcavity, here on the left (b) spontaneous without triggering,\nhere under 40x objective.

(d) Long term rise of a bubble in a vertical sample.\n\nFrom this pressure, the stored elastic energy of water can be evaluated to be Ep = \u2212 21 \u2206pVb . If all\nthis energy was released into kinetic energy, writing\n2\nEk = 23 \u03c1l Vb \u1e58b for a bubble in liquid10 of density \u03c1l , we\ncould expect bubble oscillations with maximum velocity\n\u1e58b = (\u2212\u2206p/3\u03c1l )1/2 \u223c 100 m/s, and a characteristic time\n\u03c4 = Rb /\u1e58b of 0.1 \u03bcs only (for a cavity such that Rb =10\n\u03bcm, Rc =40 \u03bcm). This time is of the same order than\nthe observed initial relaxation time of the light intensity\nsignal (0.3 \u03bcs). The system shows oscillations that are\nrapidly damped, probably because of dissipation in the\ngel surrounding the microcavities, besides viscous dissipation in water or acoustic emissions.\nOne may wonder about the content of the cavitation\nbubble. After cavitation, the bubble quickly fills with\nwater vapor, which has a diffusion coefficient Dvap =\n2.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 m2 s\u22121 . With R0 the initial size of the bubble,\nthe typical vapor filling time is R02 /Dvap \u223c 10\u22125 s, thus\nlonger than initial dynamics. Then it also probably fills\nwith air, that was dissolved in water and in the hydrogel.\nThese processes might slightly change the pressure inside\nthe bubble, but cannot account for the continuous postnucleation expansion of the cavitation bubble.\nLong time scales. Indeed, after its fast expansion to\nthe volume Vb,0 , the bubble is not static but slowly grows,\n\n\f3\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTime (s)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nRc (\u03bcm)\n\n\u0394 p (MPa)\n\n23\n\n22.5\n\n22\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nTime (s)\n\n0.6\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n60\n40\n\n2\n\n10 \u22125\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nExperiment number\n\nFIG. 3: Evolution of (a) the bubble radius Rb and (b) the cavity radius Rc .

(d) Estimation of the tension that is\nrelaxed, for triggered (full circles) and spontaneous bubbles\n(open circles).\n\nuntil it completely fills the cavity, after a time of approximately 100 s. To quantify this growth, we analysed the\nevolution of the volumes of the cavity and of the bubble\nversus time (Fig. 4). The bubble expansion Vb \u2212 Vb,0 versus time follows a power law over more than 5 decades of\ntime, with exponents in the range 0.35 to 0.45 (Fig. 4c).\nNeglecting evaporation, there are only two ways to\nmake the bubble grow: increase the volume of the cavity\nor transfer liquid from the cavity to the gel. The analysis\nof Vc (t) shows that the size of the cavity indeed increases\nwith time (Fig. 3c). However, since the bubble eventually fills the whole cavity, an outwards flow of water must\noccur.\nWe developed a simple model to account for the powerlaw expansion of the cavitation bubble. In the following,\nwe will only describe the growth of the bubble by flow in\nthe gel and hypothesize a constant cavity volume.\nWhen cavitation occurs, the pressure in the liquid\nsuddenly relaxes from a homogeneous negative value\npl = \u2212\u2206p, to a local value pl = pg \u2212 2\u03c3/R0 with\n2\u03c3/R0 the capillary pressure due to water surface tension, and pg the gas pressure inside the bubble. We\nthen have |pl | \u226a \u2206p. This locally changes the osmotic\npressure \u03a0 = P \u2212 pl in the gel near the surface of the\ncavity, where P is the external isotropic stress (here being constant, equal to atmospheric pressure). Incidently,\na gradient of osmotic pressure \u2207\u03a0 develops across the\ngel, entailing water fluxes q which follow Darcy's law\nk(\u03c6)\nq = \u2212 k(\u03c6)\n\u03bc \u2207pl = \u03bc \u2207\u03a0, with k the permeability, \u03bc the\nviscosity, \u03c6 the polymer volume fraction.\nThe conservation of mass implies16 : \u2202\u03c6\ndt = \u03c6\u2207 * q.

The value18 of this coefficient is\naround D \u223c 10\u221211 m2 s\u22121 .\nThe diffusion\nof pressure entail fluxes that follow q =\n\u221a\nk/\u03bc \u00d7 \u2206p/ \u03c0Dt, over the cavity surface S = 4\u03c0Rc2 . The\ntransferred volume is therefore dvl /dt = q S, so that under the hypothesis of a constant cavity volume Vc , the\nbubble volume departs at long times scales from the initial volume V0 (given by Eq. 1) along:\n\u0012 \u0013n\nVb\nt\n=1+\n(3)\nV0\nt\u03b1\n\u00112\n\u0010\nR2\nsw V0\nwith n = 1/2, and t\u03b1 = \u03c0 Dc K\n, which represents\n6\u2206p Vc\nthe time for which the bubble volume has doubled.\nFitting experimental curves of bubble growth of Fig.\n4a (for times t<1s), provides t\u03b1 and exponent n values\ndisplayed on Fig. 4c. The value of n is close to the\npredicted value 1/2, except for the largest characteristic time t\u03b1 . The observed range of t\u03b1 is also in excellent agreement with the expected value, predicted using\nthe negative pressure measured in the first section: with\n\u2206p = 20 MPa, Ksw = 100 MPa, D = 10\u221211 m2 s\u22121 and\n\n\f4\nvalues extracted from one experiment of Rc = 23\u03bcm and\nR0 = 6.8\u03bcm, one finds t\u03b1 = 0.08 s. The final filling of\nthe bubble, when Rb = Rc can be deduced from Eq. 3,\nand occurs at a time:\n\u0012\n\u00132\nR2 Ksw\n,\n(4)\ntf = \u03c0 c\nD 6\u2206p\nwhere we have neglected V0 in front of Vc . Using the\nsame numerical values as above, one finds tf = 115 s, in\nvery good agreement with the experimental observations.\nNote that the cavity volume is not constant in the experiment, so that the diffusion model should describe primarily the transferred liquid volume. Preliminary analysis of this volume provides larger growth exponents: this\nphenomenon is still under investigation. Also another\nchallenge is to understand why, surprisingly, the curves\nof Fig. 4a, show that there is no detectable transfer of\nfluid to the gel during the first 10 ms after cavitation,\nsince Vb (t) and \u2206Vc (t) initially differ by a constant offset. Then, an outward flow proceeds, which results in gas\nfilling of the cavity.\nIn conclusion, we report in this Letter the first direct\nobservations of spontaneous and triggered cavitation of\nwater under static tension in confined geometries. The\nnucleated bubble initially expands at a sub-microsecond\ntimescale, driven by a tension of tens of MPa. These\nextreme tensions result in visible water volume changes.\nThese extereme tensions lead to uncommon facts in microfluidics: very fast velocities (30 m/s) and visible liquid\nvolume changes associated with inertia, as can be seen on\nthe initial damped oscillations of the bubble. Work is under way to fully characterize these oscillations. Also, the\ncavitation events studied here show a milder dynamic as\ncompared to a free liquid with successive collapses. Thus,\ncavitation in water under tension leads to nucleation of\nbubbles but not to the destructive effects observed during\ncavitation bubble collapse.

Besides being useful for the design of\nhydrogel-made microfluidic devices, this fact leads to two\nremarks.\nFirst, diffusion in a hydrogel is a complex process: the\ncoefficient D arises from a subtle balance between the\nelasticity and the permeability of the gel (Eq. 2), which\nchange when it dries or hydrates. Since the hydrogel becomes softer as it rewets, this might slow the diffusion\nprocess as the cavitation bubble expands, explaining the\nfact that the growth exponents seen on Fig. 4 are always\nlower than expected from normal diffusion. Another challenge is to explain the origin of the latency time of about\n10 ms after cavitation when no flow towards the gel occurs.\nSecond, the release of tension propagates in the gel\nwhen is rewetted by water, and this effect should be felt\nin closeby cavities. Indeed, when focusing the laser in the\nmiddle of three cavities at the same distance from each\none, we noticed that the last triggered cavitation required\nmuch more laser energy than the first one. This interaction might stabilize neighboring cavities, but only for\nlimited times, since diffusion eventually smoothes out the\ntemporary pressure peak. Such a phenomenon suggest\nthat cavitation propagation can be hindered by negative\ncorrelations. Applied to the context of sap transport,\nwe hypothesize that this phenomenon may play a role in\ntrees to regulate tension in the xylem.\nThe authors thank Dr. Roberto Gonzalez and Dr.\nKeita Ando for discussions and help with the experiments and the French-Singapore Merlion grant 2.08.09\nfor financial support.\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nE.

Their\nvariation with pressure is also small: about 2.5 percents\neach 10 MPa.\nConservation of mass for the polymer implies \u03c6 \u03b4V = cst\nfor an elementary hydrogel volume \u03b4V . Its variation is\nd\u03c6\n= \u2212 \u03b4V\nwhile conservation of mass for the\nthus: d\u03b4V\ndt\n\u03c6 dt\n=\nfluid implies: d\u03b4V\ndt\nformula in the text.\n\nd\u03b4Vl\ndt\n\n= \u2212\u03b4V \u2207 * q, which gives the\n\n17\n\n18\n\nThis swelling modulus under constant isotropic stress can\n\u2202p\nalso be expressed as Ksw = V \u2202V\n, V being the total hydrogel volume. It is equivalent to a compression bulk modulus,\nbut with opposite sign, as a polymer network inflates when\nincreasing the solvent pressure.\nThis value is deduced from measurements of the relaxation time of a drying hydrogel. For our pHEMA hydrogel, we estimate Ksw \u2243 100 MPa from Flory's theory13 ,\nso the estimated hydrogel permeability is very low: k/\u03bc =\n10\u221219 m2 /Pa.s. For comparison, with Polyacrilamide hydrogel: Tanaka et al14 find D \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u221212 m2 s\u22121 . This\ndiffusion coefficient is similar to the present pHEMA hydrogel, but originates from very different values of elasticity and permeability, since they have k/\u03bc = 1/f =\n5 \u00d7 10\u221215 m2 /Pa.s, but a much softer gel.\n\n\f"}
