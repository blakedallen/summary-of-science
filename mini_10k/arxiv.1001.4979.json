[1]. The partition\nfunction of the compact version of this model can be written as\nZ(\u03b2t , \u03b2s ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n2\nY Y\nd\u03c9n (x)\nexp S[\u03c9] ,\n2\u03c0\nx\u2208\u039b n=0\n\nwhere \u039b is an L2 \u00d7 Nt lattice, S is the Wilson action\nX\nX\ncos \u03c9(pt )\ncos \u03c9(ps ) + \u03b2t\nS[\u03c9] = \u03b2s\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\npt\n\nps\n\nand sums run over all space-like (ps ) and time-like (pt ) plaquettes. The plaquette angles\n\u03c9(p) are defined in the standard way. The anisotropic couplings \u03b2t and \u03b2s are defined in\nRef. [1]. Since we study the theory at finite temperature, periodic boundary conditions\nin the temporal direction are imposed on the gauge fields.\nLet us recapitulate briefly what is known and/or expected about the critical behavior\nof the 3d U(1) LGT at finite temperature. At zero temperature the theory is confining\nat all values of the bare coupling constant [2], while at finite temperature the theory\nundergoes a deconfinement phase transition. It is well known that the partition function\nof the 3d U(1) LGT in the Villain formulation coincides with that of the 2d XY model\nin the leading order of the high-temperature expansion [3]. When combined with the\nuniversality conjecture by Svetitsky-Yaffe [4], this result makes one to conclude that the\ndeconfinement phase transition belongs to the universality class of the 2d XY model,\nwhich is known to have Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition of infinite\norder [5, 6]. It is therefore generally expected the critical behavior of the 3d U(1) LGT to\ncoincide with that of the XY model. In particular, one might expect the critical behavior\nof the Polyakov loop correlation function \u0393(R) to be governed by the following expressions\n\u0393(R) \u224d\n\n1\nR\u03b7(T )\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nfor \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2c and\n\u0393(R) \u224d exp [\u2212R/\u03be(t)] ,\n\n(4)\n\nfor \u03b2 < \u03b2c , t = \u03b2c /\u03b2 \u2212 1. Here, R \u226b 1 is the distance between test charges, T is the tem\u2212\u03bd\nperature and \u03be \u223c ebt is the correlation length. Such behavior of \u03be defines the so-called\nessential scaling. The critical indices \u03b7(T ) and \u03bd are known from the renormalizationgroup (RG) analysis of the XY model: \u03b7(Tc ) = 1/4 and \u03bd = 1/2, where Tc is the BKT\ncritical point. Therefore, the critical indices \u03b7 and \u03bd should be the same in the finitetemperature U(1) model if the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture holds in this case.\nThe renormalization-group calculations of the RG flow, presented in Ref. [4], gave support to the BKT scaling scenario. However, the critical indices have not been computed.\n2\n\n\fThe direct numerical check of these predictions was performed on lattices L2 \u00d7 Nt with\nL = 16, 32 and Nt = 4, 6, 8 in Ref. [7]. Though the authors of Ref. [7] confirm the expected\nBKT nature of the phase transition, the reported critical index is almost three times that\npredicted for the XY model, \u03b7(Tc ) \u2248 0.78. More recent numerical simulations of Ref. [8]\nhave been mostly concentrated on the study of the properties of the high-temperature\nphase. What is important for us here is the derivation of the critical point in Refs. [7, 8].\nIn these papers it was found that, for the isotropic lattice \u03b2s = \u03b2t = \u03b2 with L = 32 and\nNt = 8, the pseudo-critical point is \u03b2pc = 2.30(2) for Ref. [7] and \u03b2c \u2248 2.346(2) for Ref. [8].\nValues of \u03b2 above these values were taken implicitly as belonging to the deconfined phase.\nWe shall comment on this derivation later since our result for the infinite volume critical\ncoupling differs essentially for this choice of Nt .\nIn our previous paper [1] we have studied the model on extremely anisotropic lattice\nwith \u03b2s = 0. In this limit the model exhibits the deconfinement phase transition which\ngives the possibility to study the critical behavior. We presented simple analytical consideration which showed that in the limits of both small and large \u03b2t such anisotropic model\nreduces to the 2d XY model with some effective couplings. Then we performed numerical simulations of the effective spin model for the Polyakov loop which can be exactly\ncomputed in the limit \u03b2s = 0. We used lattices with Nt = 1, 4, 8 and with the spatial\nextent L \u2208 [64, 256]. Our main goal was to determine the critical index \u03b7 supposing that\nthe scaling known from the study of the XY model holds also in our case. The main\nconclusion of our investigation was that the value of the index \u03b7 is well compatible with\nthe XY value. We may thus assume that at least in the limit \u03b2s = 0 the 3d U(1) LGT\ndoes belong to the universality class of the XY model.\nEncouraged by these findings we have decided to simulate directly the isotropic model\non the lattice with Nt = 8. In this paper we present the results of these simulations for\na number of different quantities. Our general strategy is essentially the same as in the\nprevious paper. Namely, we postulate that the scaling laws of the XY model can be\nused to study the critical behavior of the gauge model. We believe that the information\ngathered so far allows for such an approach to be trustworthy. Nevertheless, in doing so we\nhave encountered certain surprises. First of all, the infinite volume critical coupling turned\nout to be essentially higher than the values for the pseudo-critical couplings reported in\nRefs. [7, 8]. As a consequence, the values of \u03b2 used in Ref. [8] to study the deconfinement\nphase lie well inside the confinement phase when the thermodynamic limit is considered.\nSecondly, the index \u03bd extracted from the scaling of the pseudo-critical couplings with L\ndoes agree well with the expected XY value \u03bd = 1/2. However, the index \u03b7 was found\nto be strikingly different from the XY value, namely \u03b7 \u2248 0.50. While the value \u03b7 \u2248 0.78\nobtained in Ref. [7] could, in principle be attributed to rather small lattices used, L = 32,\nand to an incorrect location of the critical point, our result is almost insensitive to varying\nthe spatial extent if L is large enough.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe briefly our numerical\nprocedure. The result of simulations are presented in the Section 3.

In the adopted Monte Carlo\nalgorithm a sweep consisted in a mixture of one Metropolis update and five microcanonical\nsteps. Measurements were taken every 10 sweeps in order to reduce the autocorrelation\nand the typical statistics per run was about 100k. The error analysis was performed by\nthe jackknife method over bins at different blocking levels.\nThe observable used as a probe of the two phases of the finite temperature 3d U(1)\nLGT is the Polyakov loop, defined as\nY\nU0 (~x, t) ,\n(5)\nP (~x) =\nt\n\nwhere U0 (~x, t) is the temporal link attached at the spatial point ~x. The effective theory\nfor the Polyakov loop is two-dimensional and possesses global U(1) symmetry. Since\nthe global symmetry cannot be broken spontaneously in two dimensions owing to the\nMermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem the expectation\nP value of the Polyakov loop vanishes in\nthe thermodynamic limit. On a finite lattice h ~x P (~x)i = 0 due to U(1) symmetry (if the\nboundary conditions used preserve the symmetry). This is confirmed by the numerical\nanalysis on the periodic lattice: in the confined (small \u03b2) phase the values taken by the\nPolyakov loop in a typical Monte Carlo ensemble scatter around the origin of the complex\nplane forming a uniform cloud, whereas in the deconfined (high \u03b2) phase they distribute\non a ring, the thermal average being equal to zero in both cases (see Fig. 1 for an example\nof this behavior in the case L = 32, where the transition occurs at \u03b2=2.346(2), according\nto Ref. [8]). What really feels the transition is then the absolute value of P , which has\nbeen chosen to be the order parameter in this work. It is worth to stress that this kind\nof dynamics is the same presented by the spin magnetization in the 2d XY model.\n\n4\n\n\f70\nL = 48\nL = 64\nL = 128\n\n60\n50\n\n\u03c7L\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b2\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nFigure 2: Polyakov loop susceptibility \u03c7L on the lattices L2 \u00d7 8, with L = 48, 64, 128.\n\n3\n\nResults at \u03b2s = \u03b2t\n\nAt finite volume the transition manifests through a peak in the magnetic susceptibility of\nthe Polyakov loop, defined as\n1 X\nP (~x) .\n(6)\n\u03c7L = L2 (h|P |2i \u2212 h|P |i2) , P = 2\nL\nx\nThe value of the coupling at which this happens is the pseudo-critical coupling, \u03b2pc . By\nincreasing the spatial volume, the position of the peak moves towards the (nonuniversal)\ninfinite volume critical coupling, \u03b2c . In Fig. 2 the behavior of \u03c7L around the transition is\nshown for L = 48, 64, 128. The value of \u03b2pc for a given L is determined by interpolating\nthe values of the susceptibility \u03c7L around the peak by a Lorentzian function. In Table 1\nwe summarize the resulting values of \u03b2pc and the peak values of the susceptibility \u03c7L\nfor the several volumes considered in this work (we included also the determination for\nL = 32, taken from the first paper in Ref. [8]).\nIn order to apply the finite size scaling (FSS) program, the location of the infinite\nvolume critical coupling \u03b2c is needed. The scaling law by which \u03b2c can be extracted from\nthe known values of \u03b2pc (L) depends on the nature of the transition and, in particular, on\nthe behavior of the correlation length. There are, in principle, two hypotheses to be tested:\n5\n\n\fTable 1: \u03b2pc and peak value of the Polyakov loop susceptibility \u03c7L on the lattices L2 \u00d7 8.\nL\n32\n48\n64\n96\n128\n150\n200\n256\n\n\u03b2pc\n2.346(2), Ref.

For example, \u03bd = 1/2\nholds for the 2d XY universality class.\nWe tried at first a 4-parameter fit of the data for \u03b2pc (L) given in Table 1 with the\nlaw given in Eq. (8). We excluded systematically from the fit the data for \u03b2pc (L) at the\nlowest spatial volumes, looking for a region of stability of the parameters. Defining Lmin\nas the smallest value of L for which \u03b2pc (L) has been considered in the fit, we could not\nfind a stable fit for Lmin < 96. In particular, we found that the \u03c72 /d.o.f. is \u2248 10 for\nLmin = 32, \u2248 6 for Lmin = 48 and \u2248 1.8 for Lmin = 64. Moreover, we observed a strong\ndependence of the fit parameters on the starting values used in the MINUIT minimization\ncode, although the resulting fitting curve turned out to be in general rather stable. The\ninstability of parameters becomes less severe when Lmin increases and, in particular, for\nLmin = 64 the parameter \u03bd becomes compatible with the XY value, \u03bd = 0.5, although\nstill undergoing large fluctuations under change of the starting conditions of the MINUIT\nminimization procedure. A stable fit could be achieved only for Lmin = 96 and these are\nthe resulting parameters:\n\u03b2pc = \u03b2c +\n\n\u03b2c = 3.06(16) ,\n\nA = \u22125.3(5.1)\n\nB = \u22121.4(1.0) ,\n\n\u03bd = 0.49(16)\n\n(\u03c72 /d.o.f. = 1.5).\n\nWe repeated then the fit with the law (8) keeping the parameter \u03bd fixed at the XY\nvalue, \u03bd = 1/2, thus reducing to three the number of free parameters in the fit. In\n6\n\n\fthis case, the fit instability is highly suppressed with respect to the previous 4-parameter\nanalysis and, indeed, already for Lmin \u2265 48 we can quote stable values of the fit parameters\n(see Table 2). One can see that an acceptable \u03c72 /d.o.f. and a stable fit are obtained for\nLmin = 64 and Lmin = 96 and that, for the latter volume, \u03b2c is consistent with the result\nof the 4-parameter fit. We take therefore \u03b2c = 3.06(11) as our estimation for the infinite\nvolume critical coupling. The determination of \u03b2c is the first main result of this work.\nWhile performing this work, we considered also the possibility to extract the index\n\u2212\u03bd\n\u03bd from directly fitting the essential scaling law \u03be \u223c ebt against lattice data for the\ncorrelation length taken for several \u03b2 values and for several volumes. To be more precise,\nfor each considered value of L and for several \u03b2 values across \u03b2pc (L), we determined the\ncorrelation length \u03beL as the inverse decay length of the 2-point correlator of the Polyakov\nloops, interpolating the latter as if the exponential fall-off with the distance apply even\nabove \u03b2pc , where, in fact, this correlator decays power-like (see Fig. 3). At each volume\nit happens that \u03beL defined in this way increases with \u03b2 till \u03b2 \u2248 \u03b2pc and then saturates,\nconsistently with the fact that the region of power-like behavior has been reached. It\noccurs, however, that the set of all lattice data for the correlation length \u03beL that, at each\nvolume, belong to the region \u03b2 < \u03b2pc (L), lie approximately on the same curve. This is\nexpected to occur more and more accurately as the thermodynamic limit is approached.\nOne could then try to fit the lattice data for \u03beL falling on this curve with the essential\nscaling law and extract \u03bd. Unfortunately, the quality of our data did not allow us to have\na stable fit and we had to reject this method. It cannot be excluded, however, that it will\nbe reconsidered in possible future studies of the same kind.\nTable 2: Results of the 3-parameter fit of the values of \u03b2pc (L) with the law (8), \u03bd = 1/2\nfixed.\nLmin \u03b2c\nA\nB\n\u03c72 /d.o.f.\n32 5.103(50) -1523(86) 20.03(48)\n13.\n48 4.65(23) -699(239) 13.8(2.1)\n4.3\n64 3.44(15)\n-42(24)\n2.4(1.4)\n1.2\n96 3.06(11)\n-4.7(4.3) -1.5(1.1)\n0.76\nOnce an estimation for \u03b2c has been achieved, we can use the FSS analysis, which holds\njust at \u03b2c , to extract other critical indices. An interesting example is the magnetic critical\nindex, \u03b7, which enters the scaling law\n\u03c7L (\u03b2c ) \u223c L2\u2212\u03b7\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nActually in this law one should consider logarithmic corrections (see [9, 10] and references therein) and, indeed, recent works on the XY universality class generally include\nthem. However, taking these corrections into account for extracting critical indices calls\nfor very large lattices even in the XY model; for the theory under consideration to be\ncomputationally tractable, we have no choice but to neglect logarithmic corrections.\n\n7\n\n\f120\nL = 64\nL = 128\nL = 200\nL = 256\n\n100\n80\n\u03be 60\n40\n20\n0\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\u03b2\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nFigure 3: Correlation length vs \u03b2 on the lattices L2 \u00d7 8, with L=64, 128, 200, 256. The\ncorrelation length is determined as if the exponential fall-off with distance of the 2-point\ncorrelator of the Polyakov loop apply for all \u03b2 values.\nSetting the coupling \u03b2 at the value of our best estimation for \u03b2c , i.e. \u03b2 = 3.06, we\ndetermined the susceptibilities \u03c7L (\u03b2c ) for several volumes (see Table 3 for the results).\nThen, following FSS, we fitted the results with the law \u03c7L (\u03b2c ) = AL2\u2212\u03b7 and got\nA = 0.0171(10),\n\n\u03b7 = 0.496(15) (\u03c72 /d.o.f. = 0.60) .\n\n(10)\n\nThis is the second main result of our paper. We stress that this value for \u03b7 is by far\nincompatible with the 2d XY value, \u03b7XY = 0.25. The most extreme consequence of this\nfinding is that the deconfinement transition in the 3d U(1) LGT at finite temperature does\nnot belong to the same universality class as 2d XY spin model. This would contradict the\nSvetitsky-Yaffe conjecture, raising a problem in the understanding of the deconfinement\nmechanism in gauge theories. We will further comment on this issue in the next section,\ndiscussing possible ways out.\nIn such a situation, it becomes particularly useful to have another determination of the\nindex \u03b7, by an independent approach. Following the strategy of our previous paper [1],\nwe define an effective \u03b7 index, through the 2-point correlator of Polyakov loops, according\n\n8\n\n\fTable 3: Values of \u03c7L (\u03b2c = 3.06) on the lattices L2 \u00d7 8.\nL \u03c7L (\u03b2c = 3.06)\n48\n5.732(42)\n64\n8.887(76)\n96\n17.16(95)\n128\n25.37(60)\n150\n31.52(75)\n200\n50.1(2.5)\n256\n65.9(4.6)\nto\n\u03b7eff (R) \u2261\n\nlog[\u0393(R)/\u0393(R0 )]\nlog[R0 /R]\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwith R0 chosen equal to 10, as in Ref. [1]. This quantity is constructed in such a way\nthat it exhibits a plateau in R if the correlator obeys the law (3), valid in the deconfined\nphase.\nIn Fig. 4 we present \u03b7eff as a function of the distance R for several \u03b2 values on the\nlattice with L = 200. A drastic change in the behavior of \u03b7eff is observed across the value\n\u03b2 \u2217 \u2248 3. In particular for \u03b2 > \u03b2 \u2217 a plateau develops at short distances, deviations at large\nR being interpreted as a finite volume effect which becomes stronger with increasing \u03b2\nsince \u03be diverges in the deconfined phase. The appearance of this plateau is an indication\nthat the correlator takes the power behavior expected for a BKT transition.\nThe analysis of the behavior of \u03b7eff (R) has been repeated setting \u03b2 at our estimated\nvalue for \u03b2c , i.e. \u03b2 = 3.06, and increasing the spatial extent of the lattice. It turns out (see\nFig. 5) that a plateau develops at small distances when L increases and that the extension\nof this plateau gets larger with L, consistently with the fact that finite volume effects are\nbecoming less important. The plateau value of \u03b7eff can be estimated as \u03b7eff (R = 6) on the\n2562 \u00d7 8 lattice and is equal to 0.4782(25); it agrees with our previous determination of\nthe index \u03b7.\nThe scenario described by Fig. 5 for \u03b2 = \u03b2c must be valid for any \u03b2 > \u03b2c , if the\nsystem undergoes a BKT transition, since the correlator must obey a power law in the\nwhole high-\u03b2 phase. We have found that this is indeed the case by performing an analysis\nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 5 at several \u03b2 values larger than \u03b2c (see Fig. 6 for the case\nof \u03b2 = 3.50, which leads to \u03b7 \u2248 0.41)). We observe that, in general, \u03b7(\u03b2) < \u03b7(\u03b2c ) for\n\u03b2 > \u03b2c and had we estimated \u03b2c from the 3-parameter fit with Lmin = 64, instead of that\nwith Lmin = 96, i.e. 3.44(15) instead of 3.06(11), the resulting \u03b7 would change by little\nand keep still much larger than the XY value 0.25.\n\n9\n\n\f2\n\u03b2 = 2.50\n\u03b2 = 2.80\n\u03b2 = 3.00\n\u03b2 = 3.06\n\u03b2 = 3.50\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\u03b7eff\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\nR\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFigure 4: \u03b7eff vs R on the lattice 2002 \u00d7 8 for several \u03b2 values.\n\n4\n\nDiscussions\n\nIn this paper we have studied the critical behavior of the 3d U(1) LGT at finite temperature. We worked on isotropic lattice with the temporal extension Nt = 8. The\npseudo-critical coupling was determined through the peak in the susceptibility of the\nPolyakov loop. The infinite-volume critical coupling has then been computed assuming\nthe scaling behavior of the form (8). Our fitting gives the value \u03b2c = 3.06(11). The deconfinement phase is the phase where \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2c . The detailed study of the deconfined phase\nis clearly beyond the scope of the present paper. Nevertheless, this finding has immediate\nimpact on the previous studies of the model. A thorough investigation of the deconfinement phase was performed in Ref. [8]. However, all \u03b2-values used there are smaller than\nthe infinite-volume critical coupling. When the thermodynamic limit is approached the\ncritical coupling increases so that the numerical results of Ref. [8] would refer rather to\nthe confinement phase of the infinite-volume theory. This is indeed the case as we explained in the previous section. One sees from Fig. 3 that the correlation length (inverse\nof the string tension) grows till the pseudo-critical value of \u03b2 is reached. Therefore, the\nstring tension is non-vanishing for all values of \u03b2 used in Ref. [8]. We conclude the much\nlarger \u03b2-values are needed than those used in Ref. [8] to really probe the physics of the\ndeconfinement phase in the large volume limit. This however might call for very large\nlattice sizes so the feasibility of such a study is not clear at present.\n10\n\n\f\u03b7eff\n\n0.6\n0.58\n0.56\n0.54\n0.52\n0.5\n0.48\n0.46\n0.44\n0.42\n0.4\n0.38\n0.36\n0.34\n0.32\n0.3\n\nL = 64\nL = 96\nL = 128\nL = 150\nL = 200\nL = 256\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\nR\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100 110 120\n\nFigure 5: \u03b7eff vs R at \u03b2c on lattices with several values of L.\nFurthermore, the index \u03bd has been extracted from the scaling of the pseudo-critical\ncouplings (8). Its value does agree well with the expected XY value \u03bd = 1/2. Of course,\nit would be desirable to extract this index directly from the correlation of the Polyakov\nloops along the line described in the previous section.\nOne of the main results of our paper is the computation of the index \u03b7 which turns\nout to be \u03b7 \u2248 0.496. This value is essentially larger than expected and requires some\ndiscussion. The easiest explanation would be to state that the spatial lattice size used\n(L \u2208 [32 \u2212 256]) is still too small to exhibit the correct scaling behavior, hence the wrong\nvalues for \u03b2c and \u03b7 follow. However, if one makes a plot of \u03b2pc (L) vs L, one can see, by\nlooking at the trend of data, that it is unlikely that \u03b2c is much larger than our estimate.\nIn fact, our fits with the scaling law (8) show that \u03b2c decreases when Lmin increases (see\nTable 2). Therefore, our result is most likely an overestimation. This implies that the\ntrue \u03b7 is likely even larger than what we found. In any case, even if we use for \u03b2c rather\nunlikely value \u03b2c = 3.50, Fig. 6 suggests that \u03b7 \u2248 0.41, much above the XY value.\nThe next objection against our result could be the fact that we have neglected logarithmic corrections to the scaling law (9). It looks for us rather strange that logarithmic\ncorrections can lead to decreasing \u03b7 almost by two times. We want to mention that including naively such corrections into our fits always results in the increasing of \u03b7 values,\nthough these values are unstable against the maximal lattice size included into fit. Thus,\nalthough we cannot rule out this possibility, we do not think that neglecting logarithmic\n11\n\n\f\u03b7eff\n\n0.5\n0.48\n0.46\n0.44\n0.42\n0.4\n0.38\n0.36\n0.34\n0.32\n0.3\n0.28\n0.26\n0.24\n0.22\n0.2\n\nL = 64\nL = 128\nL = 200\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\nR\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFigure 6: \u03b7eff vs R at \u03b2 = 3.50 on lattices with several values of L.\ncorrections results in such a wrong prediction for \u03b7.\nLet us give a simple argument why the index \u03b7 can be different from its XY value.\nConsider the anisotropic lattice. We would like to study the limit of large \u03b2s . In the\nlimit \u03b2s = \u221e the spatial plaquettes are frozen to unity. That means, the ground state\n\u2217\n, n = 1, 2.\nis a state where all spatial fields are pure gauge, i.e. Un (x) = Vx Vx+e\nn\n\u2217\nPerform now a change of variables U0 (x) \u2192 Vx U0 (x)Vx+e0 . Then it is easy to see that\nin the leading order of the large-\u03b2s expansion the partition function factorizes into the\nproduct of Nt independent 2d XY models. Let us now look at the correlations of the\nPolyakov loops. Since the Polyakov loop is the product of gauge fields in the temporal\ndirection, the correlation function factorizes, too, and becomes a product of independent\nXY correlations, i.e.\n(12)\n\u0393U (1) (\u03b2s = \u221e, \u03b2t ) = [\u0393XY (\u03b2t )]Nt .\nHence, for asymptotically large R \u226b 1, we get\n\u0393U (1) (\u03b2s = \u221e, \u03b2t \u2265\n\n\u03b2tcr )\n\n\u224d\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nR\u03b7XY\n\n\u0015 Nt\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nThis leads to a simple relation\n\u03b7(\u03b2s = \u221e, \u03b2tcr ) = Nt \u03b7XY .\n12\n\n(14)\n\n\fSome conclusions could now be drawn. The critical behavior of the 3d U(1) LGT in\nthe limit \u03b2s \u2192 \u221e is also governed by the 2d XY model. Nevertheless, the effective index\n\u03b7 appears to be Nt times of its XY value. Now, for \u03b2s = 0 we have \u03b7(\u03b2s = 0, \u03b2tcr ) = \u03b7XY .\nThis relation and formula (14) allow to conjecture that\n\u03b7XY \u2264 \u03b7(\u03b2s , \u03b2tcr ) \u2264 Nt \u03b7XY .\n\n(15)\n\n\u03b2s = 0 corresponds to the lower limit while \u03b2s = \u221e corresponds to the upper limit. In\ngeneral, \u03b7 could interpolate between two limits with \u03b2s . Whether this interpolation is\nmonotonic or there exists critical value \u03b2scr , such that \u03b7(\u03b2s \u2264 \u03b2scr , \u03b2tcr ) = \u03b7XY and \u03b7\nchanges monotonically above \u03b2scr , cannot be answered with data we have and requires\nsimulations on the anisotropic lattices. In the paper [11] a renormalization group study of\n3d U(1) model at small \u03b2s will be presented and computations of the leading correction to\nthe large \u03b2s behavior will be given. The results of our computations support the scenario\nthat the index \u03b7 depends on the ratio \u03b2s /\u03b2t . Recently, we have obtained the results of\nsimulations for Nt = 2, 4 performed by A. Bazavov [12]. His results also point in the\ndirection of our scenario (see Fig. 7). In Fig. 7 we plot a possible behavior of \u03b7 supposing\nthe monotonic dependence.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the factorization in the large \u03b2s limit does not\naffect the index \u03bd. It follows from its definition (4) that in this limit \u03bd = 1/2 as in the\nXY model. We expect therefore that \u03bd equals 1/2 for all \u03b2s and is thus universal.\nIn view of our results it might be worth to perform numerical simulations for small but\nnonvanishing \u03b2s and for larger volumes. The feasibility of a study with larger volumes\nand better accuracy relies strongly on the possibility to improve the simulation code.\nPromising directions could be simulations of the dual formulation of the model (possibly\nwith a cluster algorithm) or the use of the L\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm [13]. The development\nof these directions is in progress.\n\nAcknowledgment\nO.B. thanks for warm hospitality the Dipartimento di Fisica dell'Universit\u00e0 della Calabria and the INFN Gruppo Collegato di Cosenza during the work on this paper.
