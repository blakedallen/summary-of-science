During\ntwo decades, this problem was essentially tackled through linear analytical estimates of the\ndisk torque onto a point-like perturber. The torque on a planet in a circular orbit can be\nsplit into two components: the differential Lindblad torque and the corotation torque. Early\nwork on planetary migration consisted in determining the sign and value of the differential Lindblad torque in a two-dimensional disk (Ward 1986), since this torque, in the linear\nregime, typically exceeds the coorbital corotation torque and therefore dictates the direction and timescale of planetary migration. This work indicated that planetary migration\nin most cases corresponds to an orbital decay towards the center, and that it is a fast process, thus posing a threat for the survival of protoplanets embedded in protoplanetary disks.\nLater efforts focused on the corotation torque (Ward 1989) and on the disk's vertical extent\nand pressure effects on the differential Lindblad torque (Artymowicz 1993). The analytical\npredictions in the linear regime were checked by numerical integration of the differential\nequations (Korycansky & Pollack 1993). Finally, Tanaka et al. (2002) have given an ex-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\npression of the tidal torque, in the linear regime, that takes into account both the Lindblad\nand coorbital corotation torques, and that fully takes into account the three dimensional\nstructure of the disk. These analytical or semi-analytical studies all consider small mass\nplanets, for which a linear approximation of the disk response is valid. Other studies dealt\nwith a strongly non-linear case, that of embedded giant planets (Lin & Papaloizou 1986a,b).\nThey showed that a giant planet tidally truncates the disk by opening a gap around its\norbit, and that it is then locked in the viscous disk evolution, a process that was much later\nreferred to as type II migration (Ward 1997). A more recent work (Masset & Papaloizou\n2003) considers the case of sub-giant planets (planets which have a mass of the order of a\nSaturn mass, if the central object has a solar mass) embedded in massive disks. This work\nshows that the coorbital corotation torque may have a strong impact on the migration, and\ncan lead to a runaway of the latter, either inwards or outwards. As this mechanism heavily\nrelies upon the finite width of the horseshoe region, it also corresponds to a non-linear mechanism. The onset of non-linear effects should therefore occur below a sub-giant planet mass,\nbut the first manifestation of these effects and their impact on planetary migration have not\nbeen investigated thus far. Korycansky & Papaloizou (1996), by writing the flow equations\nin dimensionless units, have shown that the flow non-linearity is controlled by a parameter\nM = q 1/3 /h, where q = Mp /M\u2217 is the planet mass to star mass ratio and h = H/r is the\ndisk aspect ratio. The linear limit corresponds to M \u2192 0, while the condition M > 1 has\nbeen considered as a necessary condition for gap clearance, and has sometimes been referred\nto as the gap opening thermal criterion, although a recent work by Crida & al. (2006) has\nrevisited the conditions for gap opening.\nIn the last few years, the increase of computational resources has made possible the\nevaluation of the disk torque exerted on an embedded planet by means of hydrodynamical\ncalculations, both in two dimensions (Lubow et al. 1999; Nelson et al. 2000; D'Angelo et\nal. 2002; Masset 2002; Nelson & Benz 2003a,b) and three dimensions (D'Angelo et al. 2003;\nBate et al. 2003), both for small mass planets and for giant planets. In particular, the case\nof small mass planets allows comparison with analytical linear estimates. This was done by\nD'Angelo et al. (2002, 2003) and Bate et al. (2003), who compared the torques they measured\nwith the estimate by Tanaka et al. (2002). Although D'Angelo et al. (2002) and Bate et\nal. (2003) found results in good agreement with linear expectations, D'Angelo et al. (2003)\nfound a significant discrepancy for planet masses in the range 5\u201320 M\u2295 . Namely, they found\nthat migration in this planet mass range may be more than one order of magnitude slower\nthan expected from linear estimates. In the same vein, Masset (2002) found that planetary\nmigration for the same planet masses can be much slower, or even reversed, compared to\nlinear estimates. Since the migration of protoplanetary cores of this mass constitutes a bottleneck for the build up of giant planets cores (as this build up is slow, while the migration of\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthese cores is fast), it is fundamental to establish whether this effect is real and, if confirmed,\nto investigate the reasons of this behavior. We shall hereafter refer to this discrepancy as\nthe offset.\nWe adopt for the presentation of our results a heuristic approach that consists first\nin presenting the set of properties that we could infer from our calculations, and then in\ninterpreting and illustrating them through the appropriate analysis. Besides its pedagogical\ninterest, this approach also closely follows our own approach to this problem.\nIn section 2.4, we describe the two independent codes that we used to check the properties of the offset, and we give the numerical setup used by each of these codes. In section 3 we\nlist the set of properties of the offset that our numerical experiments allowed us to identify,\nnamely:\n\u2022 The offset scales with the vortensity gradient (the vortensity being defined as the\nvertical component of the vorticity divided by the surface density).\n\u2022 The offset value varies over the horseshoe libration timescale, and tends to small values\nat small viscosity, whereas it remains large at high viscosity.\n\u2022 The maximum relative offset occurs for a planet mass that scales as h3 .\nWe then interpret these properties as due to a non-linear behavior of the coorbital corotation\ntorque that exceeds its linearly estimated value. Using the link between coorbital corotation\ntorque and horseshoe zone drag (Ward 1991, 1992; Masset 2001, 2002; Masset & Papaloizou\n2003), we perform in section 4 a streamline analysis in order to check whether the coorbital\ncorotation torque excess is associated to a horseshoe zone width excess. We find that this\nis indeed the case. In section 5, we relate this width excess of the horseshoe region to a\ntransition of the flow properties in the planet vicinity, from the linear regime to the large\nmass case in which a circumplanetary disk surrounds the planet. We finally discuss in\nsection 6 the importance of these properties for the migration of sub-critical solid cores. We\nsum up our results in section 7.\n\n2.\n\nHydrodynamical codes and numerical set up\n\nWe used two independent hydro-codes to perform our tidal torque estimates. One of\nthese codes is the 3D nested grid code NIRVANA, the other one is the 2D polar code FARGO.\nThe use of these codes was complementary: while FARGO suffers from the 2D restriction\nand its outcome is plagued by the use of a gravitational softening length, it enables one to\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nperform a wide exploration of the parameter space (mainly, in our case, in term of planet\nmass, surface density slope, disk thickness and viscosity). The properties suggested by the\nFARGO runs can later be confirmed by much more CPU-demanding 3D runs with NIRVANA.\n\n2.1.\n\nThe NIRVANA code\n\nThis code is a descendant of an early version of the MHD code NIRVANA (Ziegler &\nYorke 1997), hence the name. For the current application, the magnetic terms in the MHD\nequations are excluded. The code features a covariant Eulerian formalism that allows to work\nin Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical polar coordinates in one, two, or three dimensions. The\nMHD equations are solved on a staggered mesh, with a constant spacing in each coordinate\ndirection via a directional splitting procedure, whereby the advection part and the source\nterms are dealt with separately. The advection of the hydrodynamic variables is performed\nby means of a second-order accurate scheme that uses a monotonic slope limiter (van Leer\n1977), enforcing global conservation of mass and angular momentum. Viscous forces are\nimplemented in a covariant tensor formalism. The code allows a static mesh refinement\nthrough a hierarchical nested-grid structure (D'Angelo et al. 2002, 2003). The resolution\nincreases by a factor 2 in each direction from a sub-grid level to the next nested level. When\nemployed in a 3D geometry, this technique produces an effective refinement of a factor 8\nfrom one grid level to the next one.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe FARGO code\n\nThe FARGO code is a staggered mesh hydro-code on a polar grid, with upwind transport\nand a harmonic, second order slope limiter (van Leer 1977). It solves the Navier-Stokes and\ncontinuity equations for a Keplerian disk subject to the gravity of the central object and\nthat of embedded protoplanets. It uses a change of rotating frame on each ring that enables\none to increase significantly the time step (Masset 2000a,b). The hydrodynamical solver of\nFARGO resembles the widely known one of the ZEUS code (Stone & Norman 1992), except\nfor the handling of momenta advection. The Coriolis force is treated so as to enforce angular\nmomentum conservation (Kley 1998). The mesh is centered on the primary. It is therefore\nnon-inertial. The frame acceleration is incorporated in a so-called potential indirect term.\nThe full viscous stress tensor in cylindrical coordinates of the Navier-Stokes equations is\nimplemented in FARGO. A more detailed list of its properties can be found on its website1 .\n1\n\nSee: http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/\u223cmasset/fargo\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.3.\n\nUnits\n\nAs is customary in numerical calculations of disk-planet tidal interactions, we use the\nplanet orbital radius a as the length unit, the mass of the central object M\u2217 as the mass unit,\nand (a3 /GM\u2217 )1/2 as the time unit, where G is the gravitational constant, which is G = 1 in\nour unit system. Whenever we quote a planet mass in Earth masses, we assume the central\nobject to have a solar mass. We note Mp the planet mass and q = Mp /M\u2217 the planet to star\nmass ratio.\n\n2.4.\n\nNumerical Set up\n\nBoth codes use an isothermal equation of state with a given radial temperature (or sound\nspeed) profile. If P is the (vertically integrated for FARGO) pressure and \u03c1 the (vertically\nintegrated for FARGO) gas density, then the equation of state is P = c2s \u03c1. The disk vertical\nscale-height is H(r) = cs (r)/\u03a9(r), where \u03a9(r) is the disk angular frequency at radius r. The\ndisk aspect ratio, h(r) = H(r)/r, is taken uniform in the disks that we simulate, and it varies\nfrom h = 0.03 to h = 0.06 depending on the runs.\nThe softening length is applied to the planet potential in the following manner:\nGMp\n\u03a6p = \u2212 p 2\n,\nrp + \u01eb2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6p is the planet potential, rp the distance to the planet, and \u01eb is the softening\nlength.\nIn all the runs presented in this work, the planet is held on a fixed circular orbit. Moreover, there is no gas accretion onto the planet. This is quite different from the prescription\nof D'Angelo et al. (2003) and Bate et al. (2003). However, we shall see that the effect we\ninvestigate is related to the coorbital corotation torque, which itself is related to the horseshoe dynamics. In the case in which accretion is allowed, the flow topology in the planet\nvicinity is more complex than in a non-accreting case, with an impact on the horseshoe zone\nand on the coorbital corotation torque value. In order to retain only the physics relevant to\nthe effect we are interested in, we discard gas accretion onto the planet. It should however\nbe kept in mind that this is not realistic for planet masses Mp & 15 M\u2295 . Nonetheless, the\nphenomenon we describe does persist, and indeed was originally observed, when planetary\ncores are allowed to accrete.\nIn our runs the disk surface density is initially axisymmetric and has a power-law profile:\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\u03a3(r) = \u03a30 (r/r0 )\u2212\u03b1 , where r0 = 1 is the radius at which the surface density is \u03a30 . The\nkinematic viscosity has a uniform value over the disk. We have adopted a reference set\nup which closely resembles the one of D'Angelo et al. (2003) or Bate et al. (2003). Its\ncharacteristics are listed in Table 1. Whenever we vary one disk parameter (e.g. aspect ratio\nor viscosity), we adopt for the other parameters the reference values. For a given set of disk\nparameters, we perform several calculations with different planet masses.\nWe list below the details specific to each code:\n\u2022 In the 3D-NIRVANA runs, the computational domain is a spherical sector [Rmin , Rmax ]\u00d7\n[\u03b8min , \u03b8max ] \u00d7 2\u03c0, whose radial boundaries are Rmin = 0.4, Rmax = 2.5. Symmetry is\nassumed relative to the disk mid-plane and only the upper half of the disk is simulated, hence \u03b8max = 90\u25e6 . The minimum co-latitude, \u03b8min , varies from 80\u25e6 to 82.5\u25e6 ,\naccording to the value of the aspect ratio h. The vertical extent of the disk comprises at least 3 pressure scale-heights. Outgoing-wave (or non-reflecting) boundary\nconditions are used at the inner radial border (Godon 1996). In order to exploit the\nmirror symmetry of the problem with respect to the disk equatorial plane (the disk\nand the planet orbit are coplanar), a symmetry boundary condition was used at the\ndisk mid-plane, which enables us to simulate only the upper half of the disk. Finally, reflecting boundary conditions were used at the outer radial border, which is\nlocated sufficiently far from the orbit so that the wake reflection will not alter our\ntorque evaluation, and at \u03b8 = \u03b8min , were the matter is so rarefied that the choice of\nthe boundary condition has virtually no impact on the flow properties on the bulk of\nthe disk. The reference frame has its origin on the center of mass of the star-planet\nsystem and corotates with the planet. The grid hierarchy consists of a basic mesh\nwith (NR , N\u03b8 , N\u03c6 ) = (143, 13, 423) grid zones and 4 additional sub-grid levels centered\nat the planet's position, each with (64, 12, 64) grid zones. The initial vertical density distribution is that of an unperturbed disk in hydrostatic equilibrium, which in\nTable 1. Disk parameters for the reference calculations. There is no accretion onto the\nplanets.\nParameter\n\nNotation\n\nReference value\n\nAspect ratio\nSurface density slope\nViscosity\n\nh\n\u03b1\n\u03bd\n\n0.05\n1/2\n10\u22125\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nspherical coordinates reads \u03c1(t = 0) = \u03c10 (R) exp [(sin \u03b8 \u2212 1)/h2 ]/(sin\u221a\u03b8)(\u03b1+1) , where\n\u03c10 \u221d 1/R(\u03b1+1) and the sound speed is assumed to scale as cs \u221d h/ R sin \u03b8. Such\ndensity profile is stationary in the limit Mp \u2192 0. The initial surface density, obtained\nby integrating the mass density in \u03b8, is \u03a3 = \u03a30 (a/R)\u03b1 , where \u03a30 = 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 . Calculations were performed for many values of the planet to star mass ratio, from q = 10\u22126\nto q = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 , in disks with various values of the initial density slope \u03b1, aspect ratio\nh, and kinematic viscosity \u03bd. Simulations were run for up to 140 orbital periods to\nmeasure (partially) saturated coorbital corotation torques. Shorter runs (10 orbits)\nwere used to monitor (partially) unsaturated corotation torques. In 3D calculations,\ntorques arising from the Roche lobe are not very sensitive to the choice of the softening\nparameter, \u01eb, in the planet gravitational potential, as long as it is a small fraction of\nthe Hill radius RH = a(q/3)1/3 . We used \u01eb = 0.1RH . However, some models were also\nrun with a smaller softening length and produced no significant differences.\n\u2022 In the 2D-FARGO runs, the mesh inner boundary is at Rmin = 0.5 and the mesh\nouter boundary is at Rmax = 2.1. A non-reflecting boundary condition was used\nat each boundary. The resolution is of Nrad = 153 zones in radius and N\u03c6 = 600\nzones in azimuth. The mesh spacing is uniform both in radius and in azimuth. The\nframe corotates with the planet. The value of \u03a30 is 6 * 10\u22124 . The potential softening\nlength is \u01eb = 0.3H. This value is quite low. Preliminary calculations have shown that\nthe offset is much larger at small potential softening length value, which is why we\nadopted this value. For a given set of disk parameters, we performed 35 calculations\nwith 35 different planet masses, in geometric sequence and ranging from q = 10\u22126 to\nq = 10\u22123.5 : qi = 10\u22126+2.5i/34 , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 34. Most of the calculations are run for 100\norbits, in order for the coorbital corotation torque to saturate if the disk parameters\nimply its saturation. We have also performed series of short runs for 10 orbits, in order\nto have an unsaturated corotation torque.\n\n2.5.\n\nTorque evaluation\n\n\u2022 In the 3D runs, the gravitational torques acting on the planet are evaluated either\nevery 5 orbits (long-run simulations) or every orbit (short-run simulations). In the\nfirst case, the total torque is averaged over the last 30 orbital periods of the calculation\nwhereas, in the second case, it is averaged from t = 7 and t = 10 orbits. As mentioned\nin section 2.4, accretion onto the planetary core is not allowed. In the low mass limit,\nthis leads to the formation of a gas envelope around the planet. The size of the\nenvelope depends on the core mass and is a fraction of RH . To avoid the envelope\nregion, torque contributions from within the Hill sphere were discarded. This choice\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmay occasionally result in some corotation torques being unaccounted for. When this\nhappens, the departure from the linear regime may be underestimated. However,\ntests performed by excluding torques from a region of radius 0.5RH 2 indicate that the\neffects would not significantly change the results of this study. Therefore, this choice is\nconservative since it may occasionally underestimate the excess of coorbital corotation\ntorques but assures that our analysis is not affected by spurious torques from material\npossibly bound to the core.\n\u2022 In FARGO, the torque exerted by the disk onto the planet is evaluated every 1/20th of\norbit. In the long runs case (100 orbits), the torque value is averaged from t = 40 to t =\n100 orbits, in order to discard any transient behavior at the beginning of the calculation,\ndue to corotation torque (possibly partial) saturation on the libration timescale. In\nthe short runs case, we generally take (unless otherwise stated) the torque average\nbetween t = 6 and t = 7 orbits. We also entertained the issue whether the Roche\nlobe material must be taken into account. The FARGO code, in its standard version,\noutputs both the torque exerted by the totality of the disk onto the planet, without\na special treatment of the Roche lobe material, and the torque obtained by tapering\nthe torque arising from the Roche lobe and its surroundings by 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212(rp /RH )2 ],\nwhere rp is the zone center distance to the planet. We show in section 3 that taking or\nnot the Roche lobe content into account does make a difference, but that qualitatively\none obtains the offset properties in both cases. We have chosen to include the Roche\nlobe content in the torque evaluation for the FARGO calculations presented in this\nwork. There is another reason for this choice, namely that the material that should be\ndiscarded in the torque calculation should be the one pertaining to the circumplanetary\ndisk: one would define the system of interest as {the planet + the circumplanetary\ndisk}. If the circumplanetary disk has a radius that scales with RH and that amounts\nto several 0.1RH for large planet masses, this is not true for the small planet masses\nthat represent most of the mass interval over which we perform the calculations. For\nthese small masses, the circumplanetary disk has a radius much smaller than a few\n0.1RH , or may not even exist, as we shall see in section 5.\n2\n\nThe net torque exerted by material deep inside the Hill sphere of a non-accreting planet is negligible if\ndensity gradients are appropriately resolved (D'Angelo et al. 2005).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.\n\nOffset properties\n\n3.1.\n\nReference run\n\n3.1.1. 2D results\nFig. 1 shows the results of the reference run, corresponding to the parameters of Table 1,\nboth with and without Roche lobe tapering. Both curves show the offset near q = 10\u22124 .\nHowever the curves do not coincide, and the offsets have slightly different shapes, which\nindicates that it is due to material located inside of the Hill sphere or in its immediate\nvicinity.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, previous two-dimensional simulations by D'Angelo\net al. (2002) have apparently missed the offset feature shown in Figure 1. The most likely\nreason why this happened is the use of an extremely small softening parameters (on the\norder of 0.02RH ), associated with the action of torques deep inside the planet's Hill sphere\n(at distances from the planet rp . 0.2RH ). We shall see in section 5 that for such a small\nsoftening length we should expect the offset feature to peak at q < 10\u22126 , which is not in the\nmass range covered by D'Angelo et al. (2002). Furthermore, their analysis is complicated\nby the inclusion of accretion and the presence of a gap or dip in the initial surface density\nprofile. We also performed a set of calculations with NIRVANA in 2D mode, using the\nreference parameters and adopting a setup similar to that of FARGO. The resulting specific\ntorque versus the planetary mass is consistent with the solid line with diamonds in Figure 1.\n\n3.1.2. 3D results\nThe behavior of the total specific torque exerted by the planet on a three-dimensional\ndisk, for the parameters given in Table 1, is illustrated in Figure 1. The departure from\nthe total torque predicted by the linear theory is largest at q = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 . A comparison\nbetween Figure 1 and Figure 6 in D'Angelo et al. (2003) allows to evaluate the impact of\ncore accretion on the excess of corotation torques. This represents an important issue since\naround 10 M\u2295 the runaway gas accretion phase is most likely to occur (e.g., Wuchterl 1993;\nPollack et al. 1996; Hubickyj, Bodenheimer, & Lissauer 2005). Accretion on the planet seems\nto enhance the excess of coorbital corotation torques, over the predictions based on the linear\nregime, since it affects the width of the horseshoe region. The location where the offset is\nmaximal recedes from q = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 , when cores are non-accreting, to q = 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 , when\ncores accrete at maximum rate.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Negative specific torque acting on the planet, as a function of its mass, in the\nreference disk for the 2D case. The solid line with diamonds shows the torque computed\nwith Roche lobe tapering, while the dashed line shows the torque computed without special\ntreatment of the Roche lobe zones. The solid line with stars shows the results of the three\n3D\ndimensional calculations, scaled by \u03a32D\n= 60/29. We note that the offset depth is\n0 /\u03a30\nlarger in the 3D case.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nDependence on the vortensity gradient\n3.2.1. 2D results\n\nFig. 2a shows the results of a set of calculations with four different disks, having different\nsurface density slopes. The set that exhibits the smallest departure to a linear trend (straight\nline) corresponds to \u03b1 = 3/2, i.e. to a flat vortensity profile, since d log(\u03a3/B)/dr = 3/2 \u2212 \u03b1.\nFig. 2b shows the quantity\nE\u03b1 (q) = 1 \u2212\n\n2\nT\u03b1 (q) qmin\n,\nq 2 T\u03b1 (qmin )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T\u03b1 (q) is the disk torque on the planet with planet to star mass ratio q when the\ndisk surface density slope is \u03b1, and qmin is the minimal mass ratio in our sample (here\nqmin = 10\u22126 ). Whenever the disk response is linear, the torque scales with q 2 and E\u03b1\nvanishes. The quantity E\u03b1 (q) is therefore a measure of the departure from linearity3 of the\ntorque. It reaches unity when the total torque cancels out, and exceeds one when migration is\nreversed. From Fig. 2b we can see that for q > 10\u22124 , the torque value differs from its linearly\nextrapolated value, regardless of the vortensity slope. For smaller masses, the departure from\nthe linearly predicted value is larger for larger vortensity slopes. Although the flat surface\nvortensity profile (\u03b1 = 3/2) does not have a vanishing E\u03b1 , it is nevertheless the profile that\nexhibits the smallest departure to linear prediction (by at most 10 % up to q \u223c 1.5 * 10\u22124 ).\nThe dashed and dotted line show the curve of E0 for the flat surface density profile (maximal\nvortensity slope) respectively scaled by 2/3 and 1/3. These curves show that the departure\nto linearity approximately scales with the vortensity slope.\n\n3.2.2. 3D results\nThe left panel of Figure 3 shows the specific torque exerted by the disk on the planet,\nobtained from 3D calculations with different surface density slopes, \u03b1. Torques are (partially)\nsaturated, which means that they have reached their steady state value, which is a fraction\nof their initial (unsaturated) value. The behavior of the quantity E\u03b1 is illustrated in right\npanel for the same models. As observed in the 2D results, the departure from the linear\n(type I) regime, increases with increasing vortensity gradient.\n3\n\nBy this we mean the departure from the torque value predicted by a linear analysis of the disk-planet\ninteraction. Naturally, it is also the departure from the linear scaling of the torque with q 2 .\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- 2D results. Left: Negative of specific torque acting on the planet, as a function of\nits mass, for four values of the surface density slope: \u03b1 = 0 (diamonds), \u03b1 = 1/2 (reference\ncalculation, triangles), \u03b1 = 1 (squares) and \u03b1 = 3/2 (crosses). The hole in the data for the\nflat surface density profile corresponds to a torque reversal. Right: departure from linearity\nfor the same surface density slopes (same symbols).

The gap in the data for\nthe \u03b1 = 0 case corresponds to situations where the total torque is positive. Right. Departure\nfrom linearity (Eq. 2) for the same values of \u03b1 (same symbols identify same models).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nDependence on the viscosity\n\nThe previous section suggests that the offset is linked to the coorbital corotation torque,\nsince it scales with the vortensity gradient across the orbit. For the vortensity slopes considered, the coorbital corotation torque acting on the planet is positive. Note that as the\noffset corresponds to a positive value added to the linearly expected torque value, this would\nsuggest that the offset corresponds to a corotation torque larger than predicted by the linear\nanalysis. If the offset is indeed due to the corotation torque, then it should depend on the\ndisk viscosity, since the corotation torque depends on it (Ward 1992; Masset 2001, 2002;\nBalmforth & Korycansky 2001; Ogilvie & Lubow 2003). We have undertaken additional sets\nof calculations, in which we take the reference values of Table 1, except that we vary the\ndisk viscosity \u03bd.\n\n3.3.1. 2D results\nWe have taken twice the viscosity reference value (\u03bd = 2 * 10\u22125 ), and half the reference\nvalue (\u03bd = 5 * 10\u22126 ). The results are presented in Fig. 4. The trend observed on this figure\nis compatible with the saturation properties of the corotation torque. The largest offset is\nobserved for the early torque value, i.e. the unsaturated one, while as the viscosity decreases\nthe departure from linearity decreases as well. Quantitatively, the behavior observed is\nalso in agreement with a corotation torque saturation. The latter depends on the ratio of\nthe libration timescale in the horseshoe region and the viscous timescale across it (Ward\n1992; Masset 2001, 2002). We can for instance evaluate how saturated the corotation torque\nshould be for q = 10\u22124. The horseshoe zone half width xs for such planet mass in a disk with\nh = H/r = 0.05 can be estimated by equating the linear estimate of the coorbital corotation\ntorque (Tanaka et al. 2002) and the horseshoe drag (Ward 1991, 1992; Masset 2001). One\nis led, in a two-dimensional disk, to:\nr\nq\nxs = 1.16a\n.\n(3)\nh\nThis yields here xs = 0.052. The ratio R defined by Masset (2001) is therefore R = 0.07 for\nthe reference run, R = 0.14 for the larger viscosity run, and R = 0.035 for the lower viscosity\nrun. To within a numerical factor, R represents the ratio of the libration timescale to the\nviscous timescale across the horseshoe region, and therefore indicates whether the corotation\ntorque should saturate (at low R) or remain unsaturated (at higher R). From Fig. 2 of\nMasset (2002), one can infer that the coorbital corotation torque should be about 40 % of\nits unsaturated value for the smaller viscosity calculation, 60 % for the reference calculation,\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nand 80 % for the larger viscosity calculation. The scatter of the curves of Fig. 4b is roughly\ncompatible with these expectations. We note in passing that (i) this estimate is only an order\nof magnitude estimate, since we inferred the value of xs from linear calculations, whereas\nwe suspect the offset to be due to a corotation torque value that differs from the linear\nestimate and (ii) it is by chance that the reference calculation, which takes the parameters\nof D'Angelo et al. (2003) and Bate et al. (2003), corresponds precisely to a corotation torque\nthat is half saturated, so that varying slightly the viscosity with respect to the reference one\nyields a strong variation of the offset amplitude. We finally note that the saturation of the\ncorotation torque depends on the planet mass, for a fixed viscosity. The smaller the planet\nmass, the less saturated is the corotation torque. We observe this behavior in Fig. 4b. Quite\nsurprisingly however, the torque is found to depend (weakly) on the viscosity at very small\nq, whereas one would expect the corotation torque to be unsaturated. The evolution of the\nsurface density profile is too weak to account for this observation. We have not investigated\nfurther this behavior, which we believe to be of minor importance for the work presented\nhere. Nevertheless, we suggest that it is linked to a drop of the coorbital corotation observed\nby Masset (2002), when the viscosity is larger than the so-called cut-off viscosity, which\ncorresponds to the viscosity for which the time needed by a fluid element to drift from the\nseparatrix to the corotation is also half the libration time of this fluid element. This limit\nviscosity \u03bdl is given by \u03bdl \u223c x2s \u03a9p /4\u03c0 (Masset 2001, 2002). Using Eq. (3), this translates\ninto \u03bdl \u223c 0.1a2 \u03a9p q/h. We should observe a drop of the corotation torque (and therefore a\ndependence of the torque on the viscosity) for \u03bd & \u03bdl , i.e. for q . ql \u223c 10h\u03bd/(a2 \u03a9p ). For\nthe reference calculation, we have ql \u223c 5 * 10\u22126 , while we get twice and half this value for the\nhigher and lower viscosity runs, respectively. The curves of Fig. 4a are roughly compatible\nwith these expectations, although around q \u223c 10\u22125 it is difficult to disentangle this effect\nfrom the onset of the departure from linearity of the torque.\n\n3.3.2. 3D results\nAs explained above, torques evaluated at early times contain coorbital corotation torques\nthat are unsaturated and thus their effect is the strongest. At later evolutionary times, the\neffects of corotation torques may tend to weaken. Figure 5 illustrates the behavior of saturation on the total specific torque, as a function of the planet mass, obtained from calculations\nwith a flat initial surface density (\u03b1 = 0). The asterisks represent torques measured around\n100 orbits, when corotation torques are partially saturated whereas diamonds refer to torques\nmeasured between 7 and 10 orbits, before saturation occurs. The offset reduces as corotation torques saturate. The planet mass for which the offset is maximum shifts towards larger\nvalues and the range of masses in which the total torque is positive shrinks (see Fig. 5). How-\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\never, a finite mass interval persists in which the departure from the linear regime can still\nbe very large.\n\n3.4.\n\nDependence on the disk thickness\n\nThe two previous sections strongly suggest that the offset is indeed a physical effect,\nindependent on the code used, and that it is linked to an excess of the coorbital corotation\ntorque with respect to its linearly estimated value. This therefore implies that the offset\ncorresponds to the onset of non-linear effects in the flow. The flow non-linearity depends on\nthe parameter M = q 1/3 /h (Korycansky & Papaloizou 1996). The onset of this behavior\nshould therefore be observed for a planet to primary mass ratio q \u221d h3 . We have undertaken\nadditional series of calculations in which we take the reference parameters of Table 1, except\nthat we vary the disk aspect ratio.\n\n3.4.1. 2D results\nWe ran series of calculations with h = 0.035, h = 0.04, h = 0.045, h = 0.055 and\nh = 0.06, in addition to the reference calculation with h = 0.05. For each series, we estimate\nthe mass for which the departure to linearity given by Eq. 2 is maximal. We refer to this mass\nas the critical mass, and we denote qc its ratio to the primary mass. This mass is determined\nfrom a parabolic interpolation of the data point which has the largest departure and its two\nneighbors. Since the disk viscosity is kept constant and equal to its reference value in all\nthese calculations, and since the critical mass varies between two sets of calculations, we\nexpect different saturation levels of the coorbital corotation torque at the critical mass, on\nthe long term. This could mangle our analysis, and it is therefore important to take the\nunsaturated torque value. This is why the E\u03b1 (q) values in the analysis of this section are\nevaluated using the torque value averaged between t = 3 and t = 5 orbits. The results are\npresented in Fig. 6. We see on this figure that there is an excellent agreement between the\nresults of the calculations and the expectation qc \u221d h3 . This is a strong point in favor of our\nhypothesis that this behavior is due to the onset of non-linear effects.\n\n3.4.2. 3D results\nIn order to examine the dependence of the offset on the disk aspect ratio, we set up 3D\nmodels with an initial surface density slope equal to \u03b1 = 0 and a relative disk thickness h\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nranging from 0.03 to 0.06. For each value of h, a series was built by varying the planet to\nstar mass ratio, q, from 10\u22126 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . The specific torque as a function of the planet\nmass, for selected disk aspect ratios, is shown in Figure 7. In thinner (i.e., colder) disks,\nthe offset of corotation torques moves towards smaller planetary cores. When h = 0.03, the\neffects of the offset are dominant between q \u2248 10\u22125 (or about 3 M\u2295 ) and q \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22125\n(or about 6 M\u2295 ), regardless of the saturation level of corotation torques. From each series,\nthe critical mass ratio qc was estimated by means of a parabolic interpolation, as done for\nthe 2D calculations. For this analysis we used total torques averaged between t = 7 and\nt = 10 orbits, i.e. before the corotation torque possibly saturate, for the reasons clarified\nin the previous section. The dependence of the critical mass ratio on the disk thickness\nis illustrated in Figure 8, along with the curve qc /qc (h = 0.03) = (h/0.03)3 (dashed line).\nThe error bars indicate the sampling of the data points around the critical mass and thus\nrepresent the largest possible error on the estimates of qc . It is evident that 3D numerical\nresults accurately reproduce the h3 -scaling expected to arise from non-linear effects in the\ncorotation region.\n\n4.\n\nStreamline analysis\n\nThe calculations shown at the previous section strongly suggest that the offset is a\nphysical effect, and that non-linear effects boost the corotation torque value with respect to\nits linearly estimated value. There is a link between the coorbital corotation torque and the\nso-called horseshoe drag (Ward 1991, 1992; Masset 2001, 2002), which is the torque arising\nfrom all the fluid elements of the horseshoe region. Although the corotation torque and the\nhorseshoe drag have same dependency on the disk and planet parameters, and although the\nhorseshoe drag may result in a very effective concept for some aspects of planetary migration\nrelated to coorbital material (Masset & Papaloizou 2003), there is no reason why these two\nquantities should be exactly the same. In particular, in the low mass regime, the horseshoe\nregion can be arbitrarily radially narrow, while the corotation torque always arises, in the\nlinear limit, from a region of width \u223c H, which corresponds to the length-scale over which\nthe disturbances in the corotation vicinity are damped. Nevertheless, it is instructive to\ninvestigate whether the behavior found is linked to a boost of the horseshoe region width\nw.r.t. its linearly estimated width. We recall the horseshoe drag expression (Ward 1991,\n1992; Masset 2001):\n3\nd log(\u03a3/B)\n\u0393HS = x4s \u03a92p \u03a3 *\n,\n4\nd log r\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nwhere xs is the half width of the horseshoe region, \u03a9p is the planet orbital frequency and\n\u03a3 is the disk surface density at the orbit. Since, in the linear limit, the torque scales with\nthe square of the planet mass, we expect the dependency xs \u221d q 1/2 (see also Ward (1992)).\nOn the large mass side we may expect, that the horseshoe region has a behavior similar to\nthe one of the restricted three body problem (RTBP) and that we have the scaling xs \u221d q 1/3 .\nWe performed an automatic streamline analysis on the flow of the 2D reference runs4 , in the\nframe corotating with the planet, after t = 10 orbits (an early stage in order to avoid, on\nthe large mass side, a radial redistribution of the disk material that alters the streamlines\nand hence the horseshoe zone width, but still sufficiently evolved so that the flow can be\nconsidered steady with a good approximation in the corotating frame), in order to find the\nseparatrices of the horseshoe region by a bisection method. We show in Fig. 9 the half width\nof the horseshoe region as a function of the planet mass. We see on this figure that:\n\u2022 the horseshoe zone width indeed scales as q 1/2 as long as the planet mass remains\nsufficiently small, since the data points and the dashed line have same slope for q <\n3 * 10\u22125;\n\u2022 there is a correct agreement between the coorbital corotation torque and the horseshoe\ndrag, since the data points and the dashed curve, obtained from Eq. (3) by assuming\na strict equality between horseshoe drag and linearly estimated coorbital corotation\ntorque, nearly coincide on this mass range.\n\u2022 We also see how the horseshoe zone width scales with q 1/3 on the large mass side, as\nexpected. The width displayed on the dotted line however differs from the horseshoe\n\u221a\nwidth of the RTBP. The latter is xs = 12a(q/3)1/3 , while we find that the data\npoints are correctly fitted by xs \u2243 2.45a(q/3)1/3 , i.e. the horseshoe width is \u223c 1.4\ntimes narrower than in the RTBP.\n\u2022 In between the linear range and the q 1/3 scaling range, that is for 3*10\u22125 < q < 1.5*10\u22124 ,\nthe horseshoe zone width falls between the two regimes, which makes it larger than its\nlinearly estimated value for any q > 3 * 10\u22125 . This corresponds precisely to the mass\nfor which migration becomes slower than linearly estimated.\n\n4\n\nThe runs on which the streamline analysis was performed differ slightly from the reference runs of\nsection 2.4: (i) the resolution was increased, with Nrad = 386 and N\u03c6 = 1728, and the radial interval was\nnarrowed, from Rmin = 0.6 to Rmax = 2.0; (ii) the sound speed, instead of the aspect ratio, was taken\nuniform, so that H(r = 1) = 0.05. Everything else corresponds to the reference runs.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nIn order to finally assess whether the torque offset can indeed be due to the excess of the\nhorseshoe zone width, we can directly estimate the excess of horseshoe drag (w.r.t. the\nlinearly extrapolated value):\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u0393HS (q) = \u0393HS (q) \u2212 \u0393HS (qmin )\n\nq\nqmin\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nand compare it to the total torque excess:\n\u2206T (q) = T (q) \u2212 T (qmin )\n\n\u0012\n\nq\nqmin\n\n\u00132\n\n=\n\n|T (qmin )|\nE\u03b1 (q).\n2\nqmin\n\n(6)\n\nThe results are displayed in Fig. 10, in which we divide the torque values by q 2 . We see that\nthe horseshoe drag excess and the total torque excess exhibit the same behavior and have a\nvery similar value in the mass range 10\u22124 < q < 2 * 10\u22124, which is a quantitative confirmation\nthat the torque excess of the offset maximum is attributable to the horseshoe zone width\nexcess. We note that although the two curves display a similar behavior for q < 10\u22124 , they\ndo not coincide on this mass range, and that the total torque excess is systematically larger\nthan the horseshoe drag excess. It is precisely for this mass range (q < 10\u22124 \u223c h3 /1.162, see\nEq. 3) that the horseshoe zone width is narrower than the disk thickness, so that not all the\ncoorbital corotation torque arises from the horseshoe region.\n\n5.\n\nFlow transition\n\nThe previous section shows that the torque offset is due to a transition of the corotational\nflow, which has a horseshoe zone width \u221d q 1/2 in the linear regime whereas it scales as q 1/3\nin the large mass regime. Fig. 11 shows the streamline topology for different masses (A:\nq = 5.44 * 10\u22126 ; B: q = 2.96 * 10\u22125 ; C: q = 8.16 * 10\u22125 ; D: q = 2.67 * 10\u22124 ). The linear\ncase (A) shows two stagnation points5 located almost at corotation, and offset in azimuth\nfrom the planet. These two stagnation points are not symmetric w.r.t. the planet, and are\nnot located on the same streamline. As long as we are in the linear regime, they remain\nessentially at the same location. Then, as the planet mass increases, both stagnation points\nmove towards the planet. The central libration region defined by the separatrix of the right\nstagnation point shrinks until it disappears, in which case we only have one stagnation point\n5\n\nWe restrict ourselves to the case of hyperbolic points (X-type), as these lie on the separatrices of the\nlibration region. The flow also features elliptic stagnation points (O-type) such as the ones that can be found\ninside the region of closed streamlines in case (A) or (D). Since those are not connected to separatrices, they\nare not relevant to the present discussion.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n(case B). As the planet mass still increases, this unique stagnation point moves towards\nsmaller azimuth while it recedes radially from the orbit (case C), then for larger masses one\ngets two stagnation points practically on the star-planet axis, which yields a picture very\nsimilar to the RTBP, where the stagnation points are reminiscent of the Lagrange points\nL1 and L2 , and a prograde circumplanetary disk appears within the \"Roche lobe\" (case D).\nThis corresponds to the regime in which the horseshoe zone width scales with q 1/3 .\nOne could argue that despite the larger resolution adopted for the streamline analysis,\nthe radial resolution \u03b4r = (Rmax \u2212 Rmin )/Nrad = 3.63 * 10\u22123 is still too coarse to properly\ndescribe the corotational flow of the small mass planets, as it amounts to a significant fraction\nof the horseshoe zone width. Fig. 12 shows the flow for q = 5.44 * 10\u22126 (case A) run with\nten times higher a radial resolution (Nrad = 3860, hence \u03b4r = 3.63 * 10\u22124 ). The excellent\nagreement between the streamlines obtained with the two different radial resolutions confirms\na fact already noted by Masset (2002), that even a low or mild radial resolution associated\nwith a bilinear interpolation of the velocity fields allows to capture correctly the features of\nthe corotation region.\nThese flow properties are illustrated in Fig. 13, which shows both the azimuth and the\ndistance to corotation of the stagnation point(s). We see that for q < 2 * 10\u22125 we have two\nstagnation points located at corotation and on each side of the planet (i.e. one at negative\nazimuth, and one at positive azimuth). Around q \u223c 2 * 10\u22125 , the stagnation points coalesce\non a narrow mass interval. Up to q \u223c 10\u22124 , there is a unique stagnation point located\nslightly beyond corotation and at a small, negative azimuth. Finally, at q \u2248 10\u22124, another\nbifurcation occurs, and one recovers two stagnation points on either side of corotation, and\nalmost aligned with the star (|\u03c6s | \u226a |rs \u2212 rc |/a).\nFor a given finite potential softening length, there is a mass limit under which a 2D\nflow is linear everywhere, even at the planet location. A simple estimate of this mass limit\ncan be found as follows. The effective potential that dictates the motion of fluid elements\nis \u03a6\u0303 = \u03a6 + \u03b7, where \u03a6 is the gravitational potential and \u03b7 is the gas specific enthalpy. The\nlatter reads \u03b7 = \u03b70 + \u03b7 \u2032 , where \u03b70 is the fluid specific enthalpy of the unperturbed flow, which\nis a uniform quantity as the disk has initially a uniform sound speed and a uniform surface\ndensity, and where \u03b7 \u2032 = c2s log(\u03a3/\u03a30 ) is the perturbation of the specific enthalpy introduced\nby the planet. Similarly, the gravitational potential can be written as \u03a6 = \u03a6\u2217 + \u03a6p , where\n\u03a6\u2217 , the gravitational potential of the central star, corresponds to the unperturbed flow and\nwhere \u03a6p , the gravitational potential of the planet, corresponds to the perturbation. Hence\nthe effective potential can be decomposed as \u03a6\u0303 = \u03a6\u03030 + \u03a6\u0303\u2032 , where \u03a6\u03030 = \u03a6\u2217 + \u03b70 is its value\nin the unperturbed flow while \u03a6\u0303\u2032 = \u03a6p + \u03b7 \u2032 is its perturbed value.\nFigure 14 shows that the two quantities \u03a6p and \u03b7 \u2032 are of the same order of magnitude\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nand of opposite sign in the planet vicinity, so that the perturbed effective potential reduces\nto a tiny fraction of the absolute value of either quantity. A condition for the flow linearity is\nthat |\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a30 |/\u03a30 \u226a 1, which therefore translates into |\u03b7 \u2032|/c2s \u226a 1, or, at the planet location,\ninto:\nrB \u226a \u01eb,\n(7)\nwhere\n\nGMp\n(8)\nc2s\nis the planet's Bondi radius. The flow linearity in the planet vicinity in a 2D calculation\nis therefore controlled by the ratio of the potential softening length to the Bondi radius.\nFig. 15 shows the absolute value of the azimuth of the left stagnation point as a function of\nmass, for the runs described below as well as for a similar set of runs with a smaller softening\nlength (\u01eb = 0.1H = 0.005). In both cases, we see that as long as the planet's Bondi radius is\nmuch smaller than the softening length, the stagnation point has an almost fixed and large\nvalue, so that it resides far from the planet, whereas it lies within the Bondi radius when the\nlatter is larger than the potential softening length. The departure from linearity therefore\noccurs at lower mass in the smaller softening length case. Assuming that the horseshoe zone\nseparatrix does not intersect any shock (a reasonable assumption for small mass planets),\none can use the invariance of the Bernoulli constant in the corotating frame, in the steady\nstate, to relate the perturbed quantities at the stagnation point to the horseshoe zone width.\nThe Bernoulli constant reads:\nrB =\n\nJ=\n\nu2 + r 2 (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9p )2\n+ \u03a6 \u2212 r 2 \u03a92p /2 + \u03b7.\n2\n\n(9)\n\nThis expression reduces, at a stagnation point located on the orbit, to:\nJstag = \u03a6\u2217 (a) + \u03b70 + \u03a6\u0303\u2032S \u2212 a2 \u03a92p /2,\n\n(10)\n\nJsep = (a + xs )2 [\u03a9(a + xs ) \u2212 \u03a9p ]2 /2 + \u03a6\u2217 (a + xs ) + \u03b70 \u2212 (a + xs )2 \u03a92p /2\n\n(11)\n\nwhile it reads\n\non the separatrix, far from the planet, where the effective potential essentially reduces to its\nunperturbed value \u03a6\u2217 + \u03b70 . Equating Eqs. (10) and (11) and expanding Eq. (11) to second\norder in (xs /a) yields:\nr\n1\n8\nxs =\n(12)\n\u2212 \u03a6\u0303\u2032S .\n\u03a9p\n3\nThe horseshoe zone half width is therefore simply related to the value of the Bernoulli\nconstant at the stagnation point. We can understand the boost of the horseshoe region\nwidth in the transition region as follows:\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\u2022 as long as the flow remains linear, the stagnation point is located at a fixed position\nfar from the planet. It therefore samples a value of the perturbed Bernoulli constant\nthat simply scales with q, hence the horseshoe zone width scales with q 1/2 .\n\u2022 When rB \u223c \u01eb, the stagnation point begins to move towards the planet (see Fig. 15),\nwhich implies that |\u03a6\u0303\u2032S |/q is no longer a constant but increases with q, as the stagnation\npoint goes deeper into the effective potential well of the planet. As a consequence the\nhorseshoe zone width increases faster than q 1/2 in this regime.\nThe above discussion is valid for a 2D situation with a finite potential softening length.\nUnder these circumstances, the dimensionless parameter that controls the flow linearity is\n\u01eb/rB . In a three dimensional case with a point-like mass, we can gain some insight on the\ncondition for the flow linearity assuming a horizontal, layered motion for each slice of disk\nmaterial. Although we know that this is not strictly the case (D'Angelo et al. 2003), it is\nnevertheless a useful approximation that relates the three dimensional case to the above\ndiscussion. In each slice, the planet potential is the one of a 2D situation with a potential\nsoftening length |z|, where z is the slice altitude. Therefore, if over most of the disk's vertical\nextent, the flow is linear (that is, if over most of the disk's vertical extent, |z| \u226b rB , which\namounts to the condition H \u226b rB ) then most of the torque acting on the planet arises from\nslices which contribute linearly to the torque, hence the total torque nearly amounts to its\nlinearly estimated value, whereas if the Bondi radius amounts to a significant fraction of\nthe disk's vertical extent, the layers with altitude |z| < rB have an excess of horseshoe zone\nwidth and contribute significantly to the total torque value, which therefore has a significant\noffset w.r.t the linear estimate. The condition for the appearance of the offset in a 3D case\nis therefore rB \u223c H, which also reads q \u223c h3 , or using, the notation of Korycansky &\nPapaloizou (1996), M \u223c 1. This is consistent with the dimensional analysis of Korycansky\n& Papaloizou (1996) and with our findings of section 3.4. We make the following comments:\n\u2022 Although the Bondi sphere and the Hill sphere have different expression and scaling\nwith the planet mass, they happen to coincide with the disk thickness at roughly the\nsame planet mass (within a factor of 3), so that characterizing the flow non-linearity by\ncomparing the Hill radius to the disk thickness also amounts to comparing the Bondi\nradius to the disk thickness.\n\u2022 Although we probably do not have a sufficient resolution to properly characterize the\nflow within the Bondi radius (when the softening length is shorter than this radius),\nit seems that there is no trapped region of material librating about the planet within\nthis radius. Indeed, in Fig. 11B or C, we see that the unique stagnation point, within\nthe Bondi radius, splits the disk material in its vicinity into four regions: the inner\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nand outer disk, and the two ends of the horseshoe region. This may have important\nconsequences for the numerical simulations of embedded planets in non self-gravitating\ndisks: in such disks, a common (and still debated) practice consists in truncating the\ntorque summation so as to reject the contributions from the circumplanetary material\n(e.g. Masset & Papaloizou 2003), which is considered to form, together with the planet,\na relevant system that migrates as a whole, and the migration of which is accounted\nfor by the external forces applied (hence the truncation). In the case of embedded\nsmall mass planets however, should it be confirmed that no trapped circumplanetary\nmaterial exists in the planet vicinity, then no torque truncation should be performed\nwhen evaluating the torque.\n\u2022 The offset displays a remarkable amplitude in 3D calculations, not even reproduced\nwith the relatively small softening length that we adopted in our 2D calculations (\u01eb =\n0.3H). A possible explanation for this is the vertical motion of the disk material in\nthe planet vicinity described by D'Angelo et al. (2003), which results in a bent of the\nhorseshoe streamlines towards the planet. As a result, the stagnation point associated\nto the horseshoe separatrix with altitude z far away from the planet has an altitude\n|zs | < |z|. Therefore, this stagnation point is closer to the planet than it would be\nin a sliced horizontal motion approximation, hence the perturbed Bernoulli constant\nat that point is larger than given by the horizontal motion approximation, and the\nassociated horseshoe separatrix is wider, yielding a larger contribution to the coorbital\ncorotation torque.\n\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nConsequences for planetary migration\n\nTo analyze the effect of the torque offset from linearity on the evolution of planets in\ndisks we have performed a set of test simulations. We start from the linear relation for the\nchange in semi-major axis of a planet as given by Tanaka et al. (2002) for the 3D case which\ncan be written in the following form\n\u03a3a2\nq a \u03a9p /h2 ,\nM\u2217\n\n(13)\n\n\u0227Lin = \u2212 2(1.364 + 0.541\u03b1) \u03a30 q a3/2\u2212\u03b1 /h2 ,\n\n(14)\n\n\u0227Lin = \u2212 2(1.364 + 0.541\u03b1)\nwhich, in our system of units, can be recast as\n\nwhere \u0227Lin is now given in units of AU/yrs, and in which we used M\u2217 = 1 M\u2299 and r0 = 1 AU.\nIn Eq. 14, \u03a30 denotes the surface density at r0 in units of M\u2217 /r02 . To model deviations from\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nlinearity the above \u0227Lin is modified by our numerically found offset E\u03b1 (q) as defined by\nEq. (2), while the scaling law for the critical mass qc \u221d h3 (cf. Sect. 3.4) is included, in the\nfollowing manner:\n\u0014\n\n\u0227 = \u0227Lin 1 \u2212 E\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\nqh30\nh3\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere h0 = 0.05 is the disk aspect ratio for which we have sampled the dimensionless offset\nE\u03b1 (q) by 3D calculations.\nTo make the simulations numerically simpler the hydrodynamically found data points\nare approximated by analytical functions, where we find a combination of two Lorentzians\nmatched at q = qc very useful. In addition we use, for demonstration only, a linear growth\nlaw for the planetary mass q = q0 t/tgrow . To integrate the equation a standard 4th order\nRunge-Kutta scheme is used.\nAs an illustrative example we have performed simulations for the intermediate case\n\u03b1 = 1/2, and in Fig. 16 our results are displayed. The left panel shows the offset for the 3D\ncase for the unsaturated and partially saturated torques (\u03bd = 10\u22125 ) with h = 0.05, where\nthe symbols refer to the hydrodynamical models described above and the lines refer to the\nanalytical fit formulae. In the right panel we display our results on the migration of a planet\nin the presence of an offset from linearity, using q0 = 10\u22125 and tgrow = 105 yrs. For the flaring\nof the disk we use h \u221d r 0.28 with h = 0.07 at r = 5.2AU and a value of \u03a3 = 300g/cm2 at\nr0 = 1AU, translating to \u03a30 = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nThe dashed line refers to the standard linear case, the dotted line to the partially\nsaturated case, and the solid line to the unsaturated case. Clearly the offset yields an\nextended migration time scale. In the partially saturated case, where E\u03b1 remains always\nsmaller than unity, the total migration time (to reach r = 0) is increased by roughly 50%.\nIn the unsaturated case, where E\u03b1 is larger than unity at the critical qc , we find indeed a\nreversal of the migration. This is possible if during the migration process of a planet the\nlocal h(r) is such that the actual mass of the planet is above the minimal mass for migration\nreversal [i.e. the mass qmin for which E\u03b1 (qmin ) = 1].\nWe have also thoroughly investigated the migration reversal domain in the flat surface\ndensity case (\u03b1 = 0), for the unsaturated case (short runs) and partially saturated case (long\nruns with \u03bd = 10\u22125 ). The results are displayed in Fig. 17. In this figure one can see that\nthe reversal domain, for h = 0.03 \u2212 0.05, typically corresponds to masses representative of\nsub-critical solid cores of giant planets.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n6.2.\n\nCorotation torque saturation issues\n\nAs we already mentioned in section 3.3, in the absence of any process that allows angular\nmomentum exchange between the horseshoe region and the rest of the disk, the coorbital\ncorotation torque saturates after a few libration timescales (Balmforth & Korycansky 2001;\nMasset 2002). Such exchange cannot be provided by pressure waves excited by the planet,\nas these wave corotate with the planet and are evanescent in the coorbital region. The\nviscous stress at the separatrices of the horseshoe region gives rise to a net flux of angular\nmomentum from this region to the inner or outer disk. In principle, some amount of disk\nviscosity should therefore be able to prevent the corotation torque saturation. An estimate\nof the minimum viscosity required to prevent the torque saturation can be determined as\nfollows: the saturation results from the libration, which tends to flatten out the vortensity\nprofile across the horseshoe region (in an inviscid 2D flow, the vortensity is conserved along\na fluid element path), while viscous diffusion tends to restore the large scale vortensity\ngradient, if any. It succeeds in doing so if the viscous timescale across the horseshoe region\nis shorter than the libration timescale (Ward 1992; Masset 2001, 2002). This yields:\n\u0010 q \u00113/2\n\u03bdm = 0.035\na2 \u03a9p ,\n(16)\nh\nwhere \u03bdm is the minimal viscosity to avoid the coorbital torque saturation (Masset et al.\n2006). As can be seen in Eq. (16), it is easier to desaturate the corotation torque of lower\nmass planets (the minimal viscosity required to do so is smaller). The reason for this is\ntwofold: as the planet mass decreases, the horseshoe zone width decreases, therefore (i)\nthe libration time increases, (ii) the viscous timescale across the horseshoe region decreases.\nRecast in terms of an \u03b1-parameter6 , Eq. (16) reads:\n\u03b1m = 0.035q 3/2 h\u22127/2 ,\n\n(17)\n\nWe can use the fact that the mass ratio q at the maximum of the offset is a linear function\nof h3 , that reads:\nq \u2248 0.56h3 ,\n(18)\nas can be easily found from Fig. (8). Using Eq. (18) to substitute either h or q in Eq. (17),\nwe obtain either:\n\u03b1m \u2248 0.018q 1/3 ,\n(19)\nor\n\u03b1m \u2248 0.015h.\n6\n\n(20)\n\nIn this section only, \u03b1 denotes in a standard manner the effective kinematic viscosity in units of H 2 \u03a9, as\nintroduced by Shakura & Sunyaev (1973), rather than the surface density slope index, as previously defined.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nThese equivalent expressions give the minimal viscosity required to prevent the saturation\nof the corotation torque for a planet mass for which the offset is maximal, i.e. for which\nmigration could be significantly slowed down or reversed, provided the corotation torque\namounts to a sizable fraction of its unsaturated value. In a disk with h = 0.04, this yields:\n\u03b1m = 6 * 10\u22124, which falls in the range of the \u03b1 values inferred from observations of T Tauri\nstars, for which \u03b1 = 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22122 .\nThe molecular viscosity of the gas is however orders of magnitude too low to account\nfor such values of \u03b1. It is generally admitted that a large fraction of a protoplanetary\ndisk is subject to the magnetorotational instability or MRI (Balbus & Hawley 1991), the\nnon-linear outcome of which is a turbulent state which endows the disk with an effective\nkinematic viscosity of the order of magnitude of the viscosity needed to account for the mass\naccretion rate inferred from observations of T Tauri disks. In such disks, however, the torque\nexerted by the gas on an embedded protoplanet displays large temporal fluctuations that\ntend to yield a random walk of the planet semi-major axis, rather than a steady drift of\nthe latter (Nelson & Papaloizou 2004; Nelson 2005). Nelson (2005) has shown that even\nfor planet masses of the order of 10 \u2212 30 M\u2295 (in a disk with h = 0.07, with no vertical\nstratification), the random fluctuations of the semi-major axis overcome the effects of type I\nmigration on timescales of the order of O(102) orbits, while Johnson et al. (2006) argue that\nsuch diffusive migration systematically lowers the planet lifetimes, even if it allows a small\nfraction of protoplanets to \"survive\" migration over the disk lifetime. In MHD turbulent\ndisks, the stochastic nature of the turbulent viscosity, although largely sufficient to maintain\nthe corotation torque unsaturated, would certainly hide the effect that we describe in this\nwork, at least over O(102) orbits. Should the random fluctuations average out over longer\ntimescales, so that a systematic drift could be reliably measured, the effect of migration slow\ndown of sub-critical solid cores should become noticeable7 .\nThere are other situations, yet numerically unexplored, in which the disk's turbulent\nstate could prevent the corotation torque saturation and yet be sufficiently mild that the\nplanet would undergo a systematic rather than stochastic migration. This could be the case\nof the so-called dead zone, a region of the disk where the gas ionization fraction is too low to\nallow the coupling of the gas to the magnetic field and where the MRI does not occur. The\ndisk upper layers above a dead zone are sufficiently ionized by external irradiation of cosmic\nrays or high-energy photons to be subject to the MRI and therefore to be turbulent (Gammie\n1996). This turbulence generates velocity fluctuations at the disk midplane, within the dead\nzone, which is therefore not completely \"dead\" and has an \u03b1 value several times smaller\n7\n\nProvided that the total torque, in a turbulent disk, can be considered as the sum of the fluctuations\narising from turbulence and of the laminar torque, which remains to date an open question.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nthan that of the active layers (Fleming & Stone 2003; Reyes-Ruiz et al. 2003; Fromang &\nPapaloizou 2006). It is likely that within the dead zone, the torque convergence is reached,\nover a given timescale, at a smaller planet mass than in an MHD turbulent disk, which\nsuggests that sub-critical solid cores could undergo a steady migration, significantly slowed\ndown, or reversed, within the dead zone.\nIt is also possible that weaker forms of turbulence may exist that are still able to\nprevent the corotation torque saturation, such as the hydrodynamics turbulence triggered\nby the global baroclinic instability (Klahr & Bodenheimer 2003). However, the turbulence\nresulting from the Kelvin Helmholtz instability due to the gas vertical shear arising from the\ndust sedimentation (Johansen et al. 2005) seems to be too weak to desaturate the corotation\ntorque for planet masses larger than \u223c 1 M\u2295 , as it yields an \u03b1-value of the order of 10\u22126 .\nWe close this section with the following comment: all what is needed to avoid the\ncorotation torque saturation is to bring \"fresh\" vortensity from the inner or outer disk to the\nhorseshoe region in less than a libration timescale. The standard approach based upon the\ncomparison of the libration and viscous timescales across the horseshoe region is certainly\ncorrect when the largest turbulent scale is smaller than the horseshoe zone width, so that\nthe vortensity enters the horseshoe region in a diffusive manner, but it is unlikely to be\nadequate when the turbulence scale is larger than the horseshoe region width. In this case,\nwhich occurs among others in the case of the MHD turbulence, one rather has to compare\nthe libration timescale to the advection timescale across the horseshoe region at the average\nturbulent speed. This plays in favor of desaturation, and seems to imply that preventing the\ncorotation torque saturation is much easier than suggested by the libration/viscous diffusion\ntimescales comparison.\n\n7.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy means of two and three dimensional calculations we have found the following:\n1. There is a boost of the coorbital corotation torque for sub-critical solid cores (M .\n15 M\u2295 ) in thin (H/r . 0.06) protoplanetary disks. In disks with shallow surface\ndensity profiles, i.e. \u03a3(r) \u221d r \u2212\u03b1 with \u03b1 < 3/2, this yields a positive excess of the\ncorotation torque that leads to a slowing down or reversal of the migration.\n2. This boost appears to be the first manifestation of the flow non-linearity (prior to gap\nopening, which occurs at larger planet mass).\n1/2\n\n3. The horseshoe region has a width that scales as Mp\n\nat low planet mass (linear\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n1/3\n\nregime), whereas it scales as Mp at large planet mass. At the transition between\nthe two regimes the horseshoe region is wider than linearly predicted, which yields the\naforementioned boost of the corotation torque.\n4. Since this is a non-linear effect, its occurrence is controlled by the dimensionless parameter M = RH /H, or rB /H = 3M3 . For a disk of given aspect ratio h, the corotation\ntorque enhancement is maximal for a planet mass Mp given by\nMp \u2248 5\n\n\u0012\n\nM\u2217\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nh\n0.03\n\n\u00133\n\nM\u2295 ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich represents a mass typical for solid cores of giant protoplanets, those for which\nthe (type I) migration timescale problem is the most acute.\n5. The torque reversal, if any, occurs therefore at lower masses in thinner disks (lower\naspect ratio). As a consequence, the migration of a planet of given mass would stop, in\na flaring disk, at a distance from the central object that depends on the planet mass.\nConversely, if an accreting protoplanet, in a flaring disk, reaches a point where the\ntidal torque cancels out, it starts to recede from the central object at a rate dictated\nby its mass growth rate.\n6. This effect has been unnoticed thus far in 2D calculations probably owing to the large\nsoftening length adopted or to strong torques arising from within the Roche lobe of\naccreting planets. Poor mass sampling may have also played a role.\n7. Small mass planets do not have a Roche lobe (i.e. a prograde circumplanetary disk\nextending over a fraction of the Hill radius). They have a Bondi sphere, that is smaller\nthan their Roche lobe. There is presently an issue about the torque evaluation in\ncalculations with non self-gravitating disks. In these calculations, it is still debated\nwhether one must include the Roche lobe content (D'Angelo et al. 2005) or not (Masset\n& Papaloizou 2003) in the sum of the elementary contributions to the torque of the disk\nmaterial. Regardless of the correct answer to this question, numericists who truncate\nthe torque summation in the planet vicinity should be aware that the sum should only\nexclude at most the (small) Bondi sphere rather than the Roche lobe when simulating\ndeeply embedded (rB \u226a H) protoplanets.\n8. In 2D calculations, the dimensionless parameter that determines the flow linearity in\nthe planet vicinity is rB /\u01eb. If \u01eb \u221d H (a prescription that we chose for the 2D runs\npresented in this work) or \u01eb \u221d RH , this dimensionless parameters scales as a function\nof q/h3 and the flow non-linearities in such 2D calculations also appear for mass ratios\nq \u221d h3 .\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nWe suggest that the findings listed above could motivate future work on the following points:\n1. The flow transition exhibited in this work could be studied in the simplified framework\nof the shearing sheet approximation. Then the asymmetry between the left and right\nstagnation points (which we believe to be a feature of minor importance, despite its\nrobustness) would disappear, and they would lie on the same separatrix. This study\ncould be undertaken using the method of Korycansky & Papaloizou (1996). A quantitative study of the flow transitions (planet mass for which the left and right stagnation\npoints coalesce, and planet mass for which a Roche lobe appears) would provide a very\nvaluable insight on the dynamics of the flow in the planet vicinity.\n2. Although we have seen that in the low mass case (deeply embedded core, or rB \u226a H)\nthe flow non-linearities are confined to the Bondi sphere, we do not have undertaken\na study of the flow within this sphere. Characterizing this flow, possibly by means of\nvery high (nested grid) numerical simulations, would be of great interest.\n3. The role of accretion has been neglected in the present analysis, while the mass range\nfor which the offset is observed, depending on the disk thickness, may involve accreting cores. It seems that accretion enhances the offset (D'Angelo et al. 2003), but a\nquantitative analysis of its impact remains to be done.\n4. We have emphasized the role played by dissipation, which must be present to prevent\nthe corotation torque saturation. As the present study deals with small mass planets,\nit should be relatively easy to prevent this saturation. So far the only self consistent\ncalculations of a turbulent disk with embedded planets deal with a fully turbulent disk\nsubject to the MRI. A study characterizing the ability of other forms of turbulence\n(such as the global baroclinic instability, or the residual turbulence of the dead zone\nin a layered accretion disk) to desaturate the corotation torque of small mass planets\nwould be very valuable.\n\nThe computations with NIRVANA reported in this paper were performed using the UK\nAstrophysical Fluids Facility (UKAFF).
