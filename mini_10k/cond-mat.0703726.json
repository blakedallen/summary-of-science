Introduction\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nSemiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are three-dimensional\n(3D), artificial, semiconductor based structures with size of a\nfew nanometars in all three directions.1,2 Their confinement,\nsmaller than de Broglie wavelength in semiconductors, leads\nto a discrete energy spectrum and a delta\u2013function atomic\u2013\nlike density of states, which enables the analogy with real\natoms, and therefore, QDs are ofter referred to as artificial\natoms. Furthermore, the coupling between QDs to obtain new\nfunctional units,3 leads to quantum dot molecules (QDM), and\nextends the analogy between real and artificial atoms to the\nmolecular realm.4\nThe growth conditions mainly determine the properties of\nQDs and QDMs. 5 Stranski-Krastanow (SK) growth mode\namong all other methods is currently widely used for selfassemble QD formation and is driven by local strain fields\nthat enables the formation of coherent islands.1,2,5 Also, the\nsame growth mode enables the formation of vertically stacked\nQDM, driven by the strain that surrounds a quantum dot in the\nlower lying layer which enforces the location of the next QD\non top of the first one.6,7 The occurrence of strain fields in and\naround the dots and significant intermixing, tightly connected\nwith the SK growth mode, as well as multi-band and intervalley mixing present in the QD systems leads to new features\nin QDs and QDMs as compared to real atoms and molecules\n(e.g. see Ref. 8).\nManipulation of the QDs' properties is driven by current\nand potential applications of QDs and QDMs, ranging from\nQD lasers,9 a possible physical representation of a quantum\nbit,10 to nanosensors used to detect DNA molecules.11 Growth\nof QDs on high index planes is one of the ways to control the\nQD properites. From the experimetal point of view, QDs'\n*\n\n| 1\n\nE-mail: vladan.mlinar@ua.ac.be; francois.peeters@ua.ac.be\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\ngrowth on high index surfaes may lead to an increased QD\ndensity and a lower size dispersion as compared to the well\u2013\nknown [001] grown QDs. It also enables 3D growth ranging\nfrom a chainlike pattern to a squarelike lattice of QDs.12\nFrom a physics point of view, it may result in the variation of\nthe photoluminescence energy with substrate orientation. This\nis due to the different planar projections of conduction and\nvalence bands of the constituent crystals forming the QDs\noriginating from different substrate orientations.\nFurthermore, an external magnetic field is an interesting\ntuning parameter that opens up a new playground for the\ninvestigation of spin-related properties.13 It also leads to a\ncompetition between quantum confinement, Coulomb\ninteraction and magnetic field confinement. 14\nA thorough theoretical analysis should include a realistic\ngeometry and composition profile of the QD, and take into\naccount the strain distribution in and around the dots, effects\nof piezoelectricity, and multi-band mixing. The electronic\nstructure calculations of QD and QDMs are usually performed\nusing k.p15-23 and atomistic methods,24-27 where inter-valley\nmixing is included as well. Furthermore, most of the previous\ntheoretical work was restricted to [001] grown QDs.\nIn this paper, we present the 3D nonsymmetrized eight\u2013\nband k.p model for electronic structure calculation of QDs\nand QDMs grown on high index planes and/or in the presence\nof an external magnetic field. Our model properly takes into\naccount the effects of the different substrate orientation by\nrotation of the coordinate system in the way that one\ncoordinate coincides with the growth direction. The effects of\na tilted external magnetic field are taken into account throught\nthe Zeeman effect and we employ a gauge invariant grid\ndiscretization based on Wilson's formulation of the lattice\ngauge theory. In the framework of the presented model, we\n\n\f90\n\n95\n\n100\n\nanalyze the effects due to substrate orientation on the\npiezoelectricity and the transition energies for InAs/GaAs\n[11k] grown QDs, where k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and InAs/GaAs\n[11l] QDM consisting of eight QDs, where l = 1, 2, 3, and\ncompare them to the ones of the well investigated [001] grown\nQDs and QDMs, respectively. Influence of the direction of an\napplied magnetic field on the electron and hole states of a\nsingle lens shaped QD, and QDM is further addressed.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Our theoretical approach\nis presented in Sec. II. The details of our numerical\nimplementation are given in Sec. III. Sec. IVA contains the\nnumerical results and discussion of the effect of substrate\norientation on the piezoelectricity and the transition energies.\nThe effects of an external magnetic field on the electronic\nproperties of QDs and QDM are discussed in Sec. IVB. Our\nresults and conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\nII. Choice of the model\n140\n\nA. Theory versus experiment\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\nWe define now the different steps in the modelling of the\nQDs' electronic and optical properties and specify at which\npoint the experimetal data are linked to our model.\n(i) Size, shape and composition profile of our model QD\nand/or QDM as they enter into our calculations are extracted\nfrom structural characterization, e.g. by cross section scanning\ntunneling microscopy or HRTEM.1,2,5 It is also important to\nnote that the strain and piezoelectric fields in and around the\ndots and the compositional intermixing during the QD growth\nlead to uncertainties in the determination of their geometry\nand composition and therefore limits the predictive power of\nthe theoretical models. (ii) In the second step we calculate the\nstrain distribution in and around the dots using continuum\nelasticity theory.28-30 The character of the strain is determined\nby the hydrostatic Tr(e) part of the strain tensor influencing\nthe conduction and valence band profiles and the biaxial part\nB(e) of the strain tensor influencing the valence band mixing.\n\n145\n\n150\n\nB.

(iii) Using diagonalization of the eight-band Hamiltonian,\nincluding the strain and piezoelectric potential, the confined\nelectron and hole energy levels are obtained as a next step in\nour modelling. Note that k.p theory is a semi \u2013 empirical\ntheory, and is parametrized by a set of experimentally\nobtained twelve parameters at the \u0393 point (see Table I,\nparameters 2\u20135 and 11\u201318). For the presnet case of\nnanostructures, for each of the materials forming the\nnanostructure, the values of the paramteres are taken from the\ncorresponding bulk material. At this point it is important to\nstress that no adjustable paramters are present in this model.\n(iv) As a final step in our model, we calculate the energy of\nthe exciton complexes and the absorption spectra. It is at this\npoint where we compare our findings with the experimental\ndata and two cases can be distinguished. First, if the available\nphotoluminescence measurements are performed on an\nensemble of QDs, the information about the individual\ncharacteristics of the QDs are lost, and therefore we consider\nour model QD as a representative of the ensemble of QDs.\nSecond, if the experimetalists provide us with single dot\nspectroscopy data, our model QD has to include the exact\ngeometry and composition profile as the ones of the dot which\nthe experiments were performed on. Only in that case one can\nexpect that the measured optical spectra is correctly\ninterpreted. In this work we will focus on the implementations\nof the points (i)\u2013 (iii) including direct Coulomb interaction.\n\n160\n\n165\n\n170\n\n175\n\nThe bandstructure of the semiconductors in the presence of\nweak perturbing inhomogeneous potentials is sucessfully\ndescribed in the framework of the multiband effective-mass\ntheory.31,32 However, the validity of this theory is\nquestionable when applied to nanostructures.33,34 The most\ncommon implementation is based on the usage of the\nappropriate bulk Hamiltonian for each constituent material\nseparately, and the envelope functions on either side of the\ninterface are connected by applying ad hoc symmetrization\nrules.35 This approach is often referred to as the conventional\napproach, and the corresponding Hamiltonain as the\nconventional Hamiltonian. We have shown, in our earlier\npublication,36 that such implementation leads to nonphysical\nsolutions in case of nanostructures having a large difference\nof the effective-mass parameters between the constituent\nmaterials. Our proposed improvement is an approach based on\nthe envelope-function theory for nanostructures developed by\nBurt and Foreman33,34 and is referred to as the\nnonsymmetrized approach and the corresponding Hamiltonian\nas\nthe\nnonsymmetrized\nHamiltonian.\nThe\nterm\n\"nonsymmetrized\" is coming from the fact that although the\nHamiltonian has to be Hermitian, its matrix elements may not\nbe.34 In case of nanostructures the k operators fail to commute\nwith the effective-mass parameteres at the heterointerface of\nthe nanostructure. In a non-zero magnetic field the k operators\nalso fail to commute between themselves. Actually, the\nadditional terms of the nonsymmetrized Hamiltonian which\nappear because of the variation of the effective-mass\n\n\f180\n\nparameters at the interface are equivalent to the Zeeman\nenergy terms appearing in the Hamiltonian due to the\n\ntan \u03c6 =\n\nk\nh2 + k 2\n, tan \u03b8 =\n.\nh\nl\n\n(2)\n\nThe strain components related to the rotated coordinate\nsystem, are denoted by \u03b5 ij\u2032 , where i, j = x, y, z, and are\nderived by applying the unitary transformation to the stiffness\ncoefficient Cij tensors according to the relationship:\n\n\u2032 = U imU jnU koU lp C mnop .\nCijkl\n210\n\nFurthermore, the relation between \u03b5 ij\u2032 and \u03b5 ij , where \u03b5 ij are\nthe strain components related to the [001] coordinate system,\nis given by:\n\n\u03b5 ij = U kiU lj \u03b5 kl\u2032 .\n\n215\n\nFig. 1 (Colour online) (a) General coordinate system (x`,y`,z`) related to\nthe [001] system (x,y,z) through a transformation matrix U(\u0444, \u03b8), where\n\u0444, \u03b8 are the azimuthal and polar angle, respectively.

Although several subtile effects were not\nincluded in the nonsymmetrized model,37 it has been shown\nthat its implementation does not lead to non-physical\nsolutions.36\n\n220\n\n225\n\n190\n\n195\n\nQDs' growth on high index (hkl) surfaces can be included in\nour model in two ways. First, one can keep the employed\nHamiltonian related to the [001] coordinate system and define\nthe structure in the [hkl] direction. Although the optical\nproperties can be extracted from such a model (see e.g. Ref.\n38), the underlying physical features of the QD system cannot\nbe traced. The second approach is based on the rotation of the\ncoordinate system and the employed Hamiltonian, in the way\nthat the Carthesian coordinate z' coincides with the growth\ndirection as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe general [hkl] coordinate system (x`, y`, z`) is then\nrelated to the conventional [001] coordinate system (x, y, z)\nthrough the transformation matrix U = U (\u03c6 , \u03b8 ) 39,40\n\n\u239b cos \u03c6 cos \u03b8\n\u239c\nU = \u239c \u2212 sin \u03c6\n\u239c cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8\n\u239d\n200\n\n205\n\nsin \u03c6 cos \u03b8\ncos \u03c6\nsin \u03c6 sin \u03b8\n\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 \u239e\n\u239f\n0 \u239f,\ncos \u03b8 \u239f\u23a0\n\n230\n\n235\n\n(1)\n\n245\n\n| 3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere i, j = x, y, z.\nWe applied here the Hamiltonian, as given in Ref. 36, to\nour QD structures. We stress that, by nature of its derivation,\nthe nonsymmetrized Hamiltonian is valid for any growth\ndirection, and one can simply replace the old k operators by\ntheir projections in the new frame (as given above).43\nD. An external magnetic field\n\n240\n\nThe angles \u03c6 and \u03b8 represent the azimuthal and polar\nangles, respectively, of the [hkl] direction relative to the [001]\ncoordinate system. The azimuthal angle \u03c6 and the polar\nangle \u03b8 are specified in terms of indices h, k, and l and are\ngiven by:\n\n(4)\n\nThe shear strains induce a piezoelectric polarization which\ncreates fixed charges and piezoelectric potentials. In the case\nof QDs and QDMs grown on high index planes the magnitude\nof the polarization field is proportional to the off-diagonal\ncomponents of the strain tensor related to the [001] coordinate\nsystem.\nThe appropriate Hamiltonian for the [hkl] crystallographic\norientation is derived by rotating the angular and\ncrystallographyc orientation\nin accordance to the\nrelationship:39-42\n\nk i\u2032 = U ij k j ,\n\nC. Modeling of quantum dots grown on high-index surfaces\n\n(3)\n\n250\n\nIn the framework of the multi-band effective-mass theory, a\nmagnetic field is included through Peierls substitution in the\nwave-vector and by adding the Zeeman energy term.31,32,44\nHowever, it has been proven that Peierls substitution in the\nHamiltonian, which subsequently is discretized on a grid, may\nlead to the breaking of gauge invariance.45 As a result of such\na straightforward implementation, large errors in the estimates\nof the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors may occur,\nproducing solutions that do not reflect the actual physics, but\nrather ill-employed numerics. Therefore, a discretization\nscheme which preserves gauge invariance is required. Here,\nwe implement a gauge invariant grid discretization based on\nWilson's formulation of the lattice gauge theory.46\nFor the discretized Hamiltonian we have to impose the\nfollowing condition: The discretized Hamiltonian has to\nmaintain all its physical properties if we perform a gauge\n46\ntransformation of the vector potential.\nr\nrOr more formally: If\nthe vector potential transforms as A \u2192 A + \u2207\u03c7 , then a wave\nfunction representing\na physical state of the system\nr\nr\nr\ntransforms\nas\nwhere\n\u03c8 (r ) \u2192 G (r )\u03c8 (r ) ,\nr\nr\nG (r ) = exp(\u2212 i (e / h) \u03c7 (r )) (e \u2013 electron charge, h - Planck\n\n\f255\n\n260\n\nconstant). As a consequence, the Hamiltonian transforms as\nr\nr\nH \u2192 G(r )HG + (r ) . Furthermore, considering a uniform\ndiscretization grid, the lattice operator Uj(\u03be) can be defined as\nUj(\u03be)=exp(-i(e/\u045b)alattAj(\u03be)), where j = x, y, z, and alatt is the\ngrid spacing, and \u03be = (lalatt, malatt, nalatt) defines the positon\non the grid. The lattice operator transformes as:\nU j (\u03be ) \u2192 G + (\u03be ) U j (\u03be )G (\u03be + j ) . Note that the Uj(\u03be) can also\nbe understood as the link variable between two points on the\ngrid. Previous relations lead to the correct discretization\nscheme, and as an example, the discretization of the second\nderivative is given by Eq. (6).\n\n\u2202 2\u03c8\n\u2192\n\u2202x 2\nU x+ (i, j , k )\u03c8 i +1, j ,k \u2212 2\u03c8 i , j , k + U x (i + 1, j , k )\u03c8 i \u22121, j ,k\n2\nalatt\n\n265\n\n270\n\n275\n\n305\n\n310\n\n(6)\n315\n\n.\n\nWe stress that the correct choice of the boundary conditions\nat the edges of the calculation box is very important. While\nthe phase of the wave function is preserved on the inner points\nof the grid, as shown above, the phase should also be\npreserved at the boundary. Imposing Dirichlet boundary\nconditions ensures phase preserving at the edges of the\ncomputational box.\nFor completeness, let us add that Wilson's formulation, as\npresented here, is oriented more to the numerical\nimplementation, and does not explicitly exploit the periodicity\nof the crystal potential. In contrast, a general theory for the\nnonperturbative Bloch solution of Schr\u00f6dinger's equations in\nthe presence of a constant magnetic field was recently\nproposed,47 where an equivalent quantum system with a\nperiodic vector potential was obtained using a single gauge\ntransformation based on a lattice of magnetic flux lines.\n\n320\n\n325\n\n330\n\n335\n\nIII. Numerical implementation of the 3D k.p\nmodel\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\nThe experimental uncertainties in the geometry and\ncomposition profile of a QD or QDM enforce us the usage of\nnumerical procedures capable for easy handling of variations\nof 3D input structures. Therefore, we will create our model\nstructure on a 3D rectangular grid which enables us to define\nparameters of our model at each node of the grid.\nStrain is determined by global minimization of the action\nintegral for elastic strain.28-30 The model takes into account\nthe finite size of the dots and includes the anisotropy of the\nelastic modulus. The components of the strain tensor are\ncalculated directly from the displacement u that minimizes the\naction integral for the strain tensor.29,30 The displacements are\ndiscretized at the nodes of the grid representig their first\nderivatives by finite differences. The first derivative is\naveraged over the eight permutations of forward and\nbackward differences.29,30 Typically, the grid consists of N =\n189\u00d7189\u00d7159 nodes. Numerically, a matrix equation Au =b is\nsolved by the conjugate gradient method (CGM), where A is a\n3N\u00d73N matrix, and b is a known vector of size 3N. The\npiezoelectric potential is extracted from the Poisson equation,\ntaking into account the image charge effects due to the\n4 |\n\n340\n\n345\n\n350\n\n355\n\ndiscontinuous dielectric constants at the hetero-interfaces.\nAlthough these image charge effects are not significant for\nour embedded QDs, they become very important in the case\nof uncapped QDs. The Poisson equation is discretized on a\nlarger grid than the one used for the strain calculations, we\ntook tipically N=199\u00d7199\u00d7199 and is solved by CGM.\nFor the calcuation of confined electron and hole states, we\nsignificantly reduce the size of our 3D grid in all three\ndirections. The reason lies in the fact that while strain decays\nslowly, with a power law, the electron and hole wave\nfunctions have an exponential decay. Therefore, our grid for\nthe electronic structure calculation is typically N=69\u00d769\u00d759.\nIn the case of the QDMs contaning eight dots, as will be\nshown later, a larger grid of N=79\u00d779\u00d779 was used. Eight\ncoupled Schr\u00f6dinger equations including the strain\nHamiltonian and the piezoelectric potential are discretized by\nthe finite difference method, whereas special care is taken for\nthe boundary nodes between the dot and the surrounding\nmaterial.48 The appropriate effective-mass parameters from\nRef. 49 (see Table. I), and grid spacing are choosen such that\nno numerically caused spurious solutions appear.50 In our\ncalculation we use a grid spacing equal to the lattice constant\nof the material that surrounds the dots. Therefore, in the\nnumerical experiment presented in next Section, the grid\nspacing equals alatt(GaAs) (see Table I). The finite-difference\nscheme is tested by checking the consistency and stability.51\nIn order to fulfil the condition of stability, the problematic\noperators for discretization are: \u2202/\u2202i, \u22022/\u2202i\u2202j where i, j = x, y,\nz, and i \u2260 j. The discrete approximation to the first\nderivatives, from the physical point of view, should exhibit\nthe same spectral characteristic, i.e. it should be non\u2013\ndissipative\nand\nnon\u2013dispersive.52\nNon-dissipative\napproximation is a necessary condition for numerical stability\nto be independent of the propagation direction.\nConfined electron and hole states are found by\ndiagonalization of the discretized Hamiltonian, with\ndimensions of several million by several million. The\nHamiltonian is diagonalized twice, once to obtain the confined\nelectron states and a second time for the confined hole states.\nIn this work the numerical implementation53 of the Jacobi\u2013\nDavidson (JD) algorithm54 is used for extracting eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors of the matrix.\nFrom the eigensolver we expect that it will give us a few\n(up to 50) inner eigenvalues and eigenvectors around the\ngiven searching energy. The JD algorithm is actually a\ncombination of the Jacobi's orthogonal component correction\n(JOCC) approach and the Davidson method.54 Beside the\nactual eigensolver loop, JD involves the solution of the linear\nsystem, i. e. the inner loop of the solver where the correction\nequatuon is solved. In the present implementation the Quasi\nMinimal Residual Simplified with preconditioning is used as\nthe linear system solver. An overall acceleration of the nested\nloop (linear system / eigenvector) is achieved if, and only if,\nthe JOCC preconditioner succeeds to increase the spectral gap\nof the desired eigenvalue so much that the entire additional\neffort spent for calculating the sophisticated correction vector\nis more than compensated. Finding the highly efficient, easy\nto calculate, preconditioner is a very tedious task and it is\ndetermined by the structure of the matrix.\n\n\f360\n\nIV. Numerical results and discussion\nA.\n\n365\n\nGrowth on high index surfaces\n\n380\n\nIt has been shown that growth of QDs on high index planes\nhas practical advantages ranging from good quality QDs, in\nthe sense of low size dispersion, to the possibility to control\nplanar and vertical ordering of QDs lattices.12 Here, we show\n\n20%. Our model QDM consists of eight identical lens shaped\nQDs, as shown in Fig. 1(c), with radius R = 7.91nm, and\nheight h = 4.52nm. We consider four different molecules,\nclassified by the distance between the dots in the lateral\ndirection dlat and the distance between the dots in the vertical\nTable 2 QDM classified by the inter-dot distances in lateral, dlat,, and\nvertical, dver, direction.\nMolecule\nM1\nM2\nM3\nM4\n\n385\n\ndlat (nm)\n2.26\n5.65\n2.26\n5.65\n\ndver (nm)\n2.82\n2.82\n5.09\n5.09\n\ndirection dver as given in Table 2.

The largest increase of the hydrostatic strain component\nis found for [111] grown QDs, whereas the [117] and [119]\ngrown QDs exhibit almost negligeable difference with [001]\ngrown QDs. Also, for [111] grown QDs the hydrostatic part of\nthe strain tensor tends rapidly to zero in the barrier, which will\nbe important for the QDM case, as discussed below.\n\nFig. 3 (Colour online) Piezoelectric potential for a QD with isosurfaces at \u00b131mV for different substrate orientation.\n\n| 5\n\n\fFig. 4 (Colour online) Contour plot of the hydrostatic strain for M1 QDM (a) in a plane along the growth direction and the diagonal of the lateral dots\nin the molecule, and (b) in the plane perpendicular to the growth direction, at the bottom of the second layer of the QDs.\n395\n\n400\n\n405\n\n410\n\n415\n\n420\n\n425\n\n430\n\nDiscussion about the influence of the QDs' size and shape on\nthe electronic and optical properties of [11k] grown QDs,\nwhere k = 1,2,3, was given in our earlier publication.17\nFig. 3 shows the piezoelectric potential of [11k] grown QDs,\nwhere k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, whereas the minimal and maximal\nvalues of the piezoelectric potential are given in Table 3. The\npiezoelectric potential of [001] grown QDs is also shown in\nFig. 3 for comparative reasons. The largest piezoelectric\npotential is obtained for [111] grown QDs, reflecting also the\nthree fold symmetry of the [111] direction. Going from the\n[111] grown QDs to [119] the value of the piezoelectric\npotential is lowered, and for [119] grown QDs, it approaches\nthe case of our reference case of [001] grown QD (although\nasymmetric as compared to the reference case). Note that it\nwas recently argued that the second order piezoelectric term,\nusually not included in the model, is of the same order of\nmagnitude as the linear term, and is responsible for the\nlowering of the piezoelectric potential.55 However, a different\nderivation of the second order piezoelectric term was also\nreported very recently,56 showing a smaller contribution of the\nsecond order piezoelectricity to the total piezoelectricity\neffect as compared to the one proposed in Ref. 56. Therefore,\nin this work, we included only the linear term as is widely\naccepted in the literature.28,15,22,26\nHydrostatic strain profiles of the M1 QDM are shown in Fig.\n4. Fig. 4(a) shows a cross section of the hydrostatic strain\nprofile along the growth direction and along the diagonal\nthrough the lateral dots in the molecule. The hydrostatic strain\nprofile in the plane perpendicular to the growth direction, at\nthe bottom of the second layer of QDs is shown in Fig. 4(b).\nThe largest strain coupling between the dots is observed for\n[113] grown QDM, whereas the strain coupling between the\ndots for [111] grown QDM is significantly reduced. This can\nbe understood by looking at the hydrostatic strain for a single\nQD (see Fig. 2). For [111] the hydrostatic component is\nalmost completely localized inside the dot. Only the case of\nthe M1 molecule is shown since with increasing distance\nbetween the dots the coupling reduces. For QDMs, the role of\npiezoelectricity is increased as compared to the single dot\n6 |\n\n435\n\n440\n\ncase. Fig. 5 shows the piezoelectric profile of the [11k] grown\nQDM, where k=1,2,3. The reference case of the [001] grown\nmolecule is shown as well. The very complex piezoelectric\npotential is a consequence of the fact that the dots forming the\nmolecule are very close to each other (~2nm). Increasing the\ndistance between the dots leads to piezoelectric potential\nprofiles that are more similar to the single dot case (not shown\nhere).\n\nFig. 5 (Colour online) Piezoelectric potential of M1 QDM with\nisosurfaces at \u00b132mV for different substrate orientation (blue -32mV, red\n+32mV).\n\n445\n\n450\n\nElectron and hole confined states are extracted from the\neight-band Hamiltonian including strain and piezoelectricity,\nand are shown in Fig. 6 for our model QDM. As we have\nalready shown for the single QD case (see Ref. 17), electron\nstates are mainly influenced by hydrostatic strain, while for\nhole states, there is a competition between strain effects and\nband mixing (increased for growth on high index surfaces).\nDepending on the size of the dot in the growth direction two\nregimes can be distinguished: (i) flat dots, where the variation\n\n\f455\n\n460\n\n465\n\nof the hole energy levels with the substrate orientation is\nmainly influenced by the hydrostatic strain, and (ii) large dots,\nwhere band mixing, resulting from the kinetic part of the\nHamiltonian, and reduced biaxial part of the strain tensor, has\na dominant influence on the variation of the hole levels with\nsubstrate orientation. For the QDM the situation is much more\ncomplex. The electron ground state is mainly determined by\nthe hydrostatic component of the strain tensor, whereas the\nelectron ground state of the [111] grown QDM is always the\nhighest in energy, and the one of the [113] grown QDM is the\nclosest energetically to the reference case of [001] grown\nQDM. The qualitative behavior of the electron ground state in\nQDM is not influenced neither by the distance between the\ndots in the vertical direction, dver, nor by the inter-dot\ndistances in the lateral direction, dlat. The excited electron\nstates, however, strongly depend on the variation of the interdot distances in the vertical direction.\n\n470\n\n475\n\n480\n\n485\n\n490\n\n495\n\ncomponent of the strain tensor supressing the influence of the\nhydrostatic component of the strain tensor. Increasing the\ninter-dot distances in the lateral direction, from M1 to M2\nQDM, the lowest hole ground state energy changes from the\none of [112] grown M1 QDM to [111] grown M2 QDM. The\nincrease of the inter-dot distances in vertical direction, from\nM1 QDM to M3 QDM, has the same impact on the variation\nof the hole ground state energy with substrate orientation.\nHowever, the increase of the inter-dot distances in lateral and\nvertical direction, from M1 QDM to M4 QDM, the lowest\nenergy has the hole ground state for [112] growth and is not\naltered by the change of inter-dot distances.\nTransition energies of QDM, including direct Coulomb\ninteraction in our calculations, as they vary with the substrate\norientation are shown in Fig. 7. Depending on the distances\nbetween the dots forming the molecule, variation of the\ntranistion energies with the substrate orientation can be rather\nsmall, as is the case of the M3 molecule, or can qualitatively\nchange their behaviour with the variation of M1 and M2\nagainst M4. For example, for [111] grown molecules changing\nthe inter-dot distance varies the transition energies up to\n50meV. Therefore, our predictions reported here, can be used\nas a guideline for potential aplication of such a system, in e.g.\noptoelectronics. Note that a recent experiment (see Ref. 12)\nsuggests the successful manipulation of the interdot distances\nboth in the lateral and in the growth (i.e. vertical) direction.\nB.

Although the results so obtained are based on\nan inconsistent formalism, the results turn out to agree rather\nwell with those obtained through a correct interpretation. As\nan example, we show the electron and hole states of the single\n[001] grown lens shaped QD of radius R = 13.56nm, and\nheight h = 5.65nm placed in an external magnetic field, where\nthe magnetic field is varied in the range 0T \u2013 40T, and is\ndirectional dependent (see Fig. 8). If the origin of the\ncoordinate system is placed in center of the dot, the difference\nin electron and hole energies and wave functions between two\nimplementations is negligible. The competition between the\nquantum confinement and effects of an external magnetic field\non the electron and hole energy levels of the lens shaped QD\nare shown in Fig. 8(a). The largest influence on the electron\nand hole energy levels is found for a magnetic field applied in\nthe growth directions (the weakest lateral confinement). In\nFig. 8(b) we show the electron and hole square modulus of the\nwave fuction at B = 0T and B = 40T, where the role of the\nmagnetic field is reflected through the additional confinement\nand Zeeman splitting. Variation of the origin of the coordinate\nsystem, however, changes the eigenenergies and leads to\nnumerically caused asymmetric wave functions. The problem\nalso arises in the treatement of magnetic field effects of\nasymmetric structures, or e. g. type II QDs (where hole or\nelectron are localized outside the dot) or QDM (see e.g.\nRef.19).\n\n545\n\n550\n\nIV.Conclusions\n\n555\n\n560\n\n565\n\n570\n\n575\n\n580\n\nFig. 9 (Colour online) (a) Probability density of the electron (violet) and\nhole (yellow) ground state in [001] grown M1 QDM.

In our case the electron and hole\nare localized in different dots, as shown in Fig. 9(a) which is a\ndirect consequence of the strain distribution and piezoelectric\neffect. Therefore, for such a system, the setting of the origin\n8 |\n\nof the coordinate system at the center of the structure would\nlead to incorrect results. As an illustration, we show the\nelectron and hole energy levels of QDM for B= 30T as they\nvary with the direction of the applied magnetic field. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 9(b). The largest splitting of the\nelectron ground state level in a magnetic field is found for the\nmagnetic field applied in the direction \u03c0/4 between x and z\ndirection, whereas the largest splitting for the hole ground\nstate level is found to be for the case of magnetic field applied\nin the growth direction.\n\nWe presented a full 3D model for electronic structure\ncalculations of QDs and QDMs grown on high index surfaces\nand/or in the presence of an external magnetic field. The\nstrain distribution is calculated in the framework of continuum\nelasticity theory, and the single particle states are extracted\nfrom the nonsymmetrized eight-band Hamiltonian. Our model\nproperly takes into account the effect of the substrate\norientation by rotation of the coordinate system in the way\nthat one coordinate coincides with the growth direction. The\neffects of a tilted external magnetic field are taken into\naccount throught the Zeeman effect and employing a gauge\ninvariant scheme based on Wilson's formulation of the lattice\ngauge theory.\nWe find that the piezoelectricity for QDs grown on [11k],\nwhere k = 1,2,3,4,5,7,9 and QDMs containing eight QDs\ngrown on [11l], where l = 1,2,3 is much stronger and\nasymmetric as compared to the case of [001] grown dots and\nmolecules, respectively. The [111] grown QDs and QDMs\nexibit the largest piezoelectric potential. We predicted the\nvariation of the transition energies of QDM as a function of\nsubstrate orientation and interdot distances in the 8 QD\nmolecule showing that the variation of the interdot distance\nqualitative changes the transition energy dependence on the\nsubstrate orientation. For example, for [111] grown\nmolecules, changing the interdot distance varies the transition\nenergies up to 50meV. We also addressed the question of the\nmagnetic field direction dependent variation of the electronic\nproperties of InAs/GaAs QDMs.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Belgian Science Policy\n(IUAP), the ESF\u2013network AQDJJ, and the European Union\nNetwork of Excellence SANDiE.\n\nNotes and references\n585\n\n1\n2\n\n590\n\n3\n4\n\n595\n\n5\n6\n\nD.
