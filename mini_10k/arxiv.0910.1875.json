LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\nAbstract. We show that asymptotically hyperbolic solutions of the Einstein constraint equations\nwith constant mean curvature can be glued in such a way that their asymptotic regions are connected.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most useful ways to produce new solutions of the Einstein constraint equations is via\ngluing techniques. The standard gluing construction is the following: We presume that (M, g, K)\nis an Einstein initial data set, with M a smooth n-dimensional manifold, g a Riemannian metric\non M , and K a symmetric tensor field on M . We further assume that this set of data satisfies the\n(vacuum) Einstein constraint equations\n(1)\n(2)\n\ndivg K \u2212 \u2207 Trg K = 0,\n\nR(g) \u2212 |K|2g + (Trg K)2 = 0,\n\nwhich are the necessary and sufficient conditions for (M, g, K) to generate a spacetime solution of\nthe (vacuum) Einstein gravitational field equations via the Cauchy problem [6]. (Here divg is the\ndivergence operator, Trg is the trace operator, R(g) is the scalar curvature, and | * |g is the tensor\nnorm, all corresponding to the metric g.)\nChoosing a pair of points p1 , p2 \u2208 M , one shows that there is a family of new solutions\n(M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , K\u03b5 ) of the constraint equations in which (i) M\u03b5 is obtained from M by (connected sum)\nsurgery joining p1 and p2 and (ii) outside of a neighborhood of the connected sum bridge in M\u03b5 ,\nthe data (g\u03b5 , K\u03b5 ) can be made as close as desired to (g, K) (in a sense to be made precise later) by\ntaking \u03b5 sufficiently small. We note that this gluing construction allows for the possibility that the\nmanifold M consists of two disconnected components; then if p1 is chosen to lie in one of the components and p2 in the other, the new glued solution effectively connects two disconnected solutions\nof the constraint equations.\nThe mathematics and the utility of the gluing of solutions of the Einstein constraint equations\nare discussed in a series of papers [10, 14\u201316], which show that gluing can be carried out for\na wide variety of initial data sets: they can be compact, asymptotically Euclidean (\"AE\"), or\nasymptotically hyperbolic (\"AH\"), and they can be vacuum solutions or non-vacuum solutions\nwith various coupled matter fields. This past work shows that in some cases the gluing can be\ndone so that the glued solution exactly matches the original one outside the gluing region, so long\nas certain nondegeneracy conditions (\"no KIDS\") hold at the points of gluing. When this can be\ndone, the gluing is said to be localized. More generally, the glued solutions may not exactly match\nDate: October 29, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\nthe original ones outside the gluing region, but can be constructed so that the data set is arbitrarily\nclose to the original solution away from this region; this is called non-localized gluing.\nSay one chooses a pair of (disjoint) asymptotically hyperbolic solutions of the constraints and\nglues them at a pair of points satisfying the necessary conditions, as described in either [15] or [10].\nIf each of the original AH data sets has a single (connected) asymptotic region (as described below\nin Section 2.1), then the glued data set, which is also asymptotically hyperbolic, necessarily has two\ndisjoint asymptotic regions. If we are working with AH initial data sets which are viewed as data\non partial Cauchy surfaces that intersect null infinity in an asymptotically simple spacetime [22],\nthen the existence of multiple asymptotic regions is problematic for physical modeling.\nIn the present paper, we show that one can glue asymptotically hyperbolic solutions of the\nconstraint equations in such a way that in fact the asymptotic region of the glued data set is\nconnected. The idea, which is modeled after the studies of Mazzeo and Pacard on gluing asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein manifolds [21], is to use the conformally compactified representation\nof asymptotically hyperbolic geometries, which models a complete, asymptotically hyperbolic manifold as the interior of a compact manifold with boundary (see Section 2.1 below). The boundary\nof this manifold, which we call the ideal boundary, is not part of the physical initial manifold, but\nrepresents asymptotic directions at infinity. The gluing is done using points p1 and p2 lying on\nthe ideal boundary. In this context, we will use the term asymptotic region to refer to any open\ncollar neighborhood of the boundary, with the boundary itself deleted. If the original manifold has\na single connected asymptotic region, then so does the glued manifold. (See Fig. 1.) If the original\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nFigure 1.\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nFigure 2.\n\nmanifold has two disjoint connected asymptotic regions with one boundary point chosen on the\nideal boundary of each region, then the glued manifold will have a single connected asymptotic\nregion (Fig. 2). (Although the ideal boundary in Fig. 1 appears to be disconnected, in the cases\nof interest the boundary of the glued manifold will be a connected sum of connected 2-manifolds,\nwhich is always connected.)\nThe results we present here do not hold for general AH initial data sets. We require that the\ndata have constant mean curvature (\"CMC\"), in the sense that Trg K is constant on M . Also,\nour results thus far provide sufficient conditions for (asymptotic) non-localized gluing. In a future\npaper, we hope to both eliminate the CMC restriction, and find conditions which are sufficient for\nthe gluing to be localized.\nTo set up our work here, we start in Section 2 with a definition and discussion of asymptotically\nhyperbolic initial data and their polyhomogeneous behavior in the asymptotic region. The section\ncontinues with a brief description of the conformal method for generating solutions of the constraint\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n3\n\nequations and the simplifications of the method which occur for constant mean curvature data. The\nconformal method is discussed here because it plays an important role both in constructing basic\nexamples of AH initial data [1] and in carrying out our gluing procedure. We conclude Section\n2 with an overview of those aspects of [1] on which our work relies. We state our main theorem\nin Section 3. We then carry out the first part of the gluing construction (\"splicing\") in Section\n4, producing a family of initial data sets depending on a small parameter \u03b5, which satisfy the\nconstraint equations approximately. Our splicing construction is modeled after the construction of\nasymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metrics in [21].\nThe proof of the main theorem relies on the use of weighted H\u00f6lder spaces. We define and\ndiscuss these spaces in Section 5, following [18]. In the rest of Section 5, we study certain elliptic\noperators which act on weighted H\u00f6lder spaces, and prove that they are invertible with norms of\ntheir inverses bounded uniformly in \u03b5. One of the key steps here is a blow-up analysis argument\nsimilar to that of [21]. Our analytical results are applied in Section 6 to correcting the traceless part\nof the glued second fundamental form. Finally, in Section 7 we use results of [12] and a contraction\nmapping argument to solve the Lichnerowicz equation and complete the proof of the main theorem.\nSection 8 contains concluding remarks.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we define and discuss examples of asymptotically hyperbolic initial data sets. We\nalso review the conformal method for creating solutions of the constraint equations.\n2.1. Asymptotically Hyperbolic Initial Data Sets. The model for asymptotically hyperbolic\ninitial data sets is the hyperboloid in (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space,\nM\u0306 = {(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) : x0 > 0 and (x0 )2 = (x1 )2 + (x2 )2 + (x3 )2 + 1},\ntogether with its induced Riemannian metric \u011f (which is a model for the hyperbolic metric of\nconstant sectional curvature \u22121) and its extrinsic curvature K\u0306 \u2261 \u011f; it is straightforward to check\nthat (M\u0306 , \u011f, K\u0306) satisfies (1) and (2).\nRoughly speaking, an asymptotically hyperbolic initial data set (M, g, K) is one in which the\nRiemannian metric g is complete and approaches constant negative curvature as one approaches\nthe ends of the manifold, and the extrinsic curvature K asymptotically approaches a pure trace\ntensor field that is a constant multiple of the metric.\nA more precise definition of asymptotic hyperbolicity is motivated by the Poincar\u00e9 disk model\nof hyperbolic space. In that model, hyperbolic space is given by the (smooth) metric\n\u0001\n4\n(dx1 )2 + * * * + (dxn )2 ,\n(3)\ng=\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 |x| )\n\non the open unit ball. If we define the function \u03c1 = 12 (1\u2212|x|2 ), then g = \u03c12 g is the Euclidean metric\nand thus extends smoothly to the closure of the open ball. Note that the function \u03c1 is smooth on\nthe closed ball, it picks out the boundary of the ball \u0001since \u03c1\u22121 (0) is equal to this boundary, and it\nsatisfies the derivative condition |d\u03c1|g = 21 d 1 \u2212 |x|2 g = 1 on the boundary of the ball.\nWith this example in mind, we make the following definitions. We suppose throughout this\npaper that M is the interior of a smooth, compact manifold with boundary M . A defining function\nfor M is a nonnegative real-valued function \u03c1 : M \u2192 R of class at least C 1 such that \u03c1\u22121 (0) = \u2202M\nand d\u03c1 does not vanish on \u2202M . Given a nonnegative integer k and a real number \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], a\nsmooth Riemannian metric g on M is said to be conformally compact of class C k (or C k,\u03b1, or C \u221e )\nif there exists a smooth defining function \u03c1 and a Riemannian metric g on M of class C k , C k,\u03b1, or\n\n\f4\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M. LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\nC \u221e , respectively, with g = \u03c1\u22122 g|M . Smoothly conformally compact means the same as conformally\ncompact of class C \u221e .\nIf g is conformally compact and if in addition |d\u03c1|g = 1 on \u2202M , then g is said to be asymptotically\nhyperbolic (of class C k , C k,\u03b1, or C \u221e , as appropriate). One verifies easily that any asymptotically\nhyperbolic metric of class at least C 2 has sectional curvatures approaching \u22121 near \u2202M (see [20]),\nand so indeed has the intuitive properties mentioned above. The boundary \u2202M is called the ideal\nboundary, and \u2202M together with its induced metric \u03b9\u2217 g (where \u03b9 : \u2202M \u0592\u2192 M is inclusion), is called\nconformal infinity. Note that for a given AH metric, the choice of the defining function is not\nunique, so the geometry of the conformal infinity is only defined up to a conformal factor.\nNaively, one might hope to work with initial data sets (M, g, K) in which (M, g) is a smoothly\nasymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifold, and K is a symmetric 2-tensor field such that\n\u03c12 K has a smooth extension to M and is equal to a constant multiple of the metric on the ideal\nboundary. Unfortunately, however, it is shown in [2] that there are obstructions to finding solutions\nwith this degree of smoothness, marked by the presence of log terms in the asymptotic expansions\nof g and K near the ideal boundary. For this reason, instead of smoothness we have to settle for a\nslightly weaker notion called polyhomogeneity, which we now define.\nA function f : M \u2192 R is said to be polyhomogeneous (cf. [20]) if it is smooth in M , and there\nexist a sequence of real numbers si \u0580 +\u221e, a sequence of nonnegative integers {qi }, and functions\nf ij \u2208 C \u221e (M ) such that\n(4)\n\nf\u223c\n\nqi\n\u221e X\nX\n\n\u03c1si (log \u03c1)j f ij\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nin the sense that for any positive integer K, there exists a positive integer N such that the difference\nf\u2212\n\nqi\nN X\nX\n\n\u03c1si (log \u03c1)j f ij\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nis O(\u03c1K ) as \u03c1 \u2192 0, and remains O(\u03c1K ) after being differentiated any number of times by smooth\nvector fields on M that are tangent to \u2202M . It is easy to check that sums and products of polyhomogeneous functions are polyhomogeneous, as are quotients of polyhomogeneous functions provided\nthat the denominator has no log terms with its lowest power of \u03c1 (i.e., q1 = 0) and provided that its\nleading term f 10 does not vanish on the ideal boundary. A tensor field on M is said to be polyhomogeneous if it is smooth on M and its component functions are polyhomogeneous in some smooth\ncoordinate chart in a neighborhood of every ideal boundary point. We define a polyhomogeneous\nasymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian metric on M to be a polyhomogeneous Riemannian metric\ng which is also conformally compact of class at least C 2 .\nNow we come to the main definition of this section.\nDefinition 1. A polyhomogeneous asymptotically hyperbolic initial data set (sometimes called a\nhyperboloidal initial data set) is a triple (M, g, K), in which\n(i) M is the interior of a smooth, compact manifold with boundary M ;\n(ii) g is a polyhomogeneous AH Riemannian metric on M ;\n(iii) K is a polyhomogeneous symmetric covariant 2-tensor field on M with the property that for\nany smooth defining function \u03c1, \u03c12 K has a C 2 extension to M whose restriction to \u2202M is\na constant multiple of (the extension of ) \u03c12 g there;\n(iv) the Einstein constraint equations (1) and (2) are satisfied.\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n5\n\nThis definition implies that g and K can be written in the form\n(5)\n(6)\n\ng = \u03c1\u22122 g,\n\u03c4\nK = g + \u03c1\u22121 \u03bc,\nn\n\nwhere g is a polyhomogeneous Riemannian metric on M that is of class at least C 2 (and thus has\nlog terms, if any, only with powers of \u03c1 greater than 2); \u03c4 is a polyhomogeneous C 2 scalar function\non M whose restriction to \u2202M is constant; and \u03bc is a polyhomogeneous symmetric 2-tensor field\non M that is trace-free with respect to g and has log terms only with powers of \u03c1 greater than\n1. A polyhomogeneous AH initial data set is defined to be CMC if the mean curvature function\n\u03c4 = Trg K is constant. We note that for such data \u03c4 must be identically equal to 3. Indeed, the\ndefinition of CMC asymptotically hyperbolic data guarantees that the scalar curvature approaches\nthe constant \u2212n(n \u2212 1) = \u22126 at the ideal boundary. Since the g-norm of \u03c1\u22121 \u03bc approaches zero at\nthe ideal boundary, inserting (6) into (2) and evaluating in the limit at the ideal boundary implies\nthat the mean curvature \u03c4 must be identically equal to 3. Thus (6) becomes\nK = g + \u03bc = \u03c1\u22122 g + \u03c1\u22121 \u03bc.\nIt is shown by Andersson and Chru\u015bciel in [1] that CMC polyhomogeneous AH initial data sets\nexist in abundance.\n2.2. The Conformal Method for Finding Solutions of the Constraint Equations. Both\nthe construction of [1] and our gluing construction here are based on the conformal method, which\n(along with the closely related conformal thin sandwich method) is the most widely used method\nfor producing solutions of the constraint equation. We proceed by reviewing this method.\nWe start by introducing two auxiliary differential operators which are involved in the conformal\nmethod.

If, for a given set of conformal data, one can solve the system\n(11)\u2013(12), then the initial data fields obtained by recomposing the fields as in (9)\u2013(10) provide a\nsolution to the constraint equations.\nTo execute such a construction of initial data one needs to have a symmetric, traceless, and\ndivergence-free tensor \u03bd. There is a standard method for finding such a tensor [23]. The idea\nbehind the method is to start with an arbitrary traceless symmetric 2-tensor field \u03bc and then find\na vector field X which satisfies\nL\u03bb X = (div\u03bb \u03bc)\u266f .\n\n(13)\n\nUsing (8) one easily verifies that \u03bd := \u03bc + D\u03bb X is symmetric, traceless and divergence-free.\nThere have been extensive studies to determine which sets of conformal data lead to solutions,\nand which do not. (See [4] for a recent review.) This issue is best understood for conformal\ndata with constant \u03c4 , which leads to initial data with constant mean curvature (\"CMC\"). In\nthis case, the constraint equations (11)\u2013(12) effectively decouple-the (unique) solution to (11) is\nD\u03bb W = 0-and one need only analyze the solvability of the (remaining) Lichnerowicz equation\n1\n1\n1\n\u2206\u03bb \u03c8 \u2212 R(\u03bb)\u03c8 + |\u03bdcd |2\u03bb \u03c8 \u22127 \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u03c8 5 = 0.\n8\n8\n12\nIt is also fairly well understood for \"near CMC\" conformal data sets, which are characterized by\n|\u2207\u03c4 |\u03bb being sufficiently small.\n(14)\n\n2.3. Conformal method and Andersson-Chru\u015bciel initial data. The Andersson-Chru\u015bciel\nconstruction [1] of polyhomogeneous AH CMC initial data on a smoothly conformally compact\n3-dimensional manifold M starts by choosing a smoothly conformally compact metric \u03bb on M and\na traceless, symmetric 2-tensor \u03bc = \u03c1\u22121 \u03bc\u0304 for which \u03bc\u0304 \u2208 C \u221e (M ). The construction continues\nby finding a solution X of the vector Laplacian equation (13) and by considering the symmetric,\ntraceless, divergence-free tensor \u03bd := \u03bc + D\u03bb X. The polyhomogeneity of X, and consequently of \u03bd,\narises naturally here as a consequence of the indicial roots of the vector Laplacian (for details on\nindicial roots see [18]). More precisely, we have the asymptotic expansions\n(15)\n(16)\n\nX \u223c \u03c12 X 0 + (\u03c14 log \u03c1)X 1\n\u03bd \u223c \u03c1\u22121 \u03bd 0 + (\u03c1 log \u03c1)\u03bd 1\n\nwith X 0 , X 1 \u2208 C \u221e (M ),\n\nwith \u03bd 0 , \u03bd 1 \u2208 C \u221e (M ).\n\nNote that the description in [1] treats \u03bd as a contravariant 2-tensor, which accounts for the difference\nbetween our powers of \u03c1 and the powers of \u03a9 and x in [1]. It is useful that Andersson-Chru\u015bciel [1]\nalso prove a sequence of existence and uniqueness results regarding solutions of equations such as\n(13) in the context of polyhomogeneous tensor fields; we rely on these results when we conclude\nthat the perturbations we make are polyhomogenous.\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n7\n\nThe construction in [1] proceeds with the analysis of the Lichnerowicz equation. It is shown\nthat the boundary value problem consisting of the Lichnerowicz equation (14) with \u03c4 = 3 and the\nboundary condition \u03c8 \u2202M = 1 has a polyhomogeneous solution of the form\n(17)\n\n\u03c8 \u223c 1 + \u03c1\u03c8 0 +\n\u03c13 log \u03c1\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\n(\u03c13 log \u03c1)i \u03c8 i ,\n\nwith \u03c8 i \u2208 C \u221e (M ).\n\nThe exponent in\ncorresponds to the indicial root of the linearization of the Lichenrowicz\noperator (cf. the left-hand side of (14) with \u03c4 = 3) in the neighborhood of the constant function\n\u03c80 \u2261 1. We point out that the analysis in [1] also includes an existence and uniqueness result for\nthe Lichnerowicz boundary value problem with polyhomogeneous data. We need this result when\nwe show that our solution of the Lichnerowicz equation is polyhomogeneous (see Theorem 25).\nFor convenience, we say that a polyhomogeneous AH initial data set (M, g, K) is of Andersson\u2013\nChru\u015bciel (A\u2013C ) type if it can be written in the form g = \u03c8 4 \u03bb and K = g + \u03c8 \u22122 \u03bd, in which \u03bb is a\nsmoothly conformally compact metric, \u03bd is a symmetric 2-tensor field that is divergence free and\ntrace free with respect to \u03bb and has an asymptotic expansion of the form (16), and \u03c8 is a positive\nfunction with an asymptotic expansion of the form (17). The discussion in [1, Appendix A] shows\nthat generically, initial data of A\u2013C type are the \"smoothest possible\" AH initial data.\nThroughout this paper, we assume only that the asymptotically hyperbolic initial data sets we\nwork with are polyhomogenous in the sense of Definition 1 (which includes data of A\u2013C type as a\nspecial case). Our gluing procedure then produces new data of the same type. We note that if our\nstarting data set is of A\u2013C type, it will not generally follow from our main theorem (Theorem 2\nbelow) that the solution we obtain after gluing is also of A\u2013C type; our results will only guarantee\nthat this solution is polyhomogeneous in the sense of Definition 1. The difficulty is that while A\u2013C\ndata is obtained by solving the conformal constraints with smooth conformal data, in carrying out\nthe gluing we must solve these equations for conformal data which includes log terms.\n3. Main Gluing Theorem\nWith the conventions established above, we are ready to state our main theorem. For convenience\nof exposition, we focus our attention here on the case dim M = 3. We have little doubt that the\ntheorem and its proof generalize easily to higher dimensions.\nTheorem 2. Let (M, g, K) be a polyhomogeneous asymptotically hyperbolic CMC initial data set\n(with dim M = 3) that satisfies the Einstein (vacuum) constraint equations, and let p1 , p2 be distinct\npoints in the ideal boundary \u2202M . Then for each \u03b5 > 0 there exists a polyhomogeneous AH initial\ndata set (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , K\u03b5 ) such that\n(i) M\u03b5 is diffeomorphic to the interior of a boundary connected sum, obtained from M by\nexcising small half-balls B1 around p1 and B2 around p2 , and identifying their boundaries.\n(ii) (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , K\u03b5 ) is a solution to the vacuum constraints.\n(iii) On the complement of any fixed small half-balls surrounding p1 and p2 in M , and away from\nthe corresponding neck region in M\u03b5 , the data (g\u03b5 , K\u03b5 ) converge uniformly in C 2,\u03b1 \u00d7 C 1,\u03b1\nto (g, K), for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\n\nIn fact, the convergence of K\u03b5 is a little better than C 1,\u03b1 : away from the fixed half-balls, it\nactually converges in a weighted C 1,\u03b1 space. See Theorem 19 for the precise statement.\nNote that, as is the case for the non-localized gluing of AH data sets at interior points (see [15]),\nthere is no need to impose any nondegeneracy conditions on the data in the neighborhood of the\ngluing points p1 and p2 .\n\n\f8\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M. LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\n4. Splicing Construction\nWe presume that we are given a 3-dimensional CMC polyhomogeneous asymptotically hyperbolic\ninitial data set (M, g, K), which is not assumed to be connected. We let \u03c1 denote a chosen smooth\ndefining function for M . We may write\nK = g + \u03bc = \u03c1\u22122 g + \u03c1\u22121 \u03bc,\nwhere g and \u03bc are polyhomogeneous, g \u2208 C 2 (M ), \u03bc \u2208 C 1 (M ), and \u03bc is trace-free with respect to g\n(or, equivalently, g). Note that the assumption that g is polyhomogeneous and of class C 2 means\nthat the first log term in the expansion of g must occur with a power of \u03c1 strictly greater than 2,\nand thus g is actually in C 2,\u03b1 (M ) for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1); and similarly \u03bc \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 (M ).\nThe gluing construction is a step by step procedure. We outline the main steps here: The first\nstep, which we call splicing, involves the construction of a one-parameter family of manifolds and\ninitial data sets that are CMC and polyhomogeneous AH, but that only approximately solve the\nconstraint equations. (In most of the literature discussing gluing constructions, both the first step\nleading to approximate solutions and the complete construction leading to exact solutions are called\n\"gluing.\" Here, to distinguish the two, we call the procedure leading to the approximate solutions\n\"splicing.\")\nThe new manifolds M\u03b5 are obtained by a connected sum construction which is executed in the\npreferred background coordinates. The parameter \u03b5 labels the coordinate \"size\" of the \"bridge\", or\ngluing region. Next we use cutoff functions tied to the parametrized gluing region to construct a\nparametrized set of metrics g\u03b5 on M\u03b5 . To verify that these spliced metrics are all asymptotically\nhyperbolic, we also construct a parametrized set of spliced defining functions \u03c1\u03b5 . Using a different\ncutoff procedure, we produce a family of (spliced) symmetric 2-tensors \u03bc\u03b5 that, by construction, are\ntrace free with respect to the corresponding g\u03b5 , but are generally not divergence free with respect\nto g\u03b5 . The next two steps involve deformations of the spliced data sets (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , K\u03b5 = g\u03b5 + \u03bc\u03b5 ) to\nproduce the glued data sets which satisfy the constraints and have the desired limit properties. To\ndeform \u03bc\u03b5 , we first estimate its divergence, and then (following the standard York prescription)\nsolve a linear elliptic system (based on the vector Laplacian Lg\u03b5 ) whose solution tensor deforms \u03bc\u03b5\nto a new family of tensors \u03bd\u03b5 that are divergence free. To deform the metric, we treat (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , \u03bd\u03b5 , 3)\nas a set of CMC conformal data, and proceed to solve the Lichnerowicz equation (14) for a family\nof conformal factors \u03c8\u03b5 . The \u03b5-parametrized data sets (M\u03b5 , \u03c8\u03b54 g\u03b5 , \u03c8\u03b5\u22122 \u03bd\u03b5 + \u03c8\u03b54 g\u03b5 ), which we call the\nglued data, then solve the constraint equations, and are verified to approach arbitrarily close (as\n\u03b5 \u2192 0) to the original data away from the gluing region.\nIn the rest of this section, we detail the splicing constructions. We detail the deformation steps\nin subsequent sections.\n4.1. Preferred background coordinates. We focus first on the given polyhomogeneous asymptotically hyperbolic geometry (M, g). Let \u03c1 be a smooth defining function, and define g = \u03c12 g,\nwhich is a C 2,\u03b1 polyhomogenous Riemannian metric on M . For each point p \u2208 \u2202M , we can choose\nsmooth functions \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 such that (\u03c1, \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) form smooth coordinates in a neighborhood U \u2282 M ,\nwhich we call background coordinates. Sometimes for reasons of notational symmetry we also set\n\u03b8 0 = \u03c1. Throughout this paper, we will index such background coordinates with indices named\na, b, c, . . . , which we understand to run from 0 to 2; and we will use indices j, k, . . . , running from\n1 to 2, to refer to coordinates on \u2202M . We will use the Einstein summation convention when\nconvenient.\nIt is shown in [12] that when g is an asymptotically hyperbolic metric that is smoothly conformally compact, there is a smooth defining function \u03c1 such that |d\u03c1|2g /\u03c12 \u2261 1 in a neighborhood of\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n9\n\n\u0001\nthe ideal boundary \u2202M , so the metric can be written in the form g = \u03c1\u22122 d\u03c12 + h(\u03c1) there, where\nh(\u03c1) is a smoothly-varying family of metrics on \u2202M with h(0) = g T \u2202M . Unfortunately, that result\ndoes not apply in the present circumstances because we are not assuming that g has a smooth\nconformal compactification. As a substitute, however, we have the following lemma:\nLemma 3. If (M, g) is a polyhomogeneous asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian geometry, then\nthere exists a smooth defining function \u03c1 such that\n(18)\n\n|d\u03c1|2g\n= 1 + O(\u03c12 ).\n\u03c12\n\nAlso, for each p \u2208 \u2202M there exist smooth background coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) on an open neighborhood\nU of p in M in which g can be written in the form\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(19)\ng = \u03c1\u22122 d\u03c12 + (d\u03b8 1 )2 + (d\u03b8 2 )2 + mab (\u03c1, \u03b8)d\u03b8 a d\u03b8 b ,\nwhere the \"error terms\" mab are uniformly bounded in U and satisfy\n(20)\n(21)\n\nm00 (\u03c1, \u03b8) = mj0 (\u03c1, \u03b8) = m0j (\u03c1, \u03b8) = O(\u03c12 ),\n\n\u0001\nmjk (\u03c1, \u03b8) = O \u03c1 + (\u03b8 ) + (\u03b8 ) ,\n1 2\n\nMoreover, g is uniformly equivalent in U to the metric \u03c1\u22122\n\n2 2\n\nj \u2208 {1, 2},\n\nj, k \u2208 {1, 2}.\n\u0001\nd\u03c12 + (d\u03b8 1 )2 + (d\u03b8 2 )2 .\n\nProof. Let \u03c10 be any smooth defining function for M , and write g 0 = \u03c120 g. The hypothesis implies\nthat there is a smooth metric g 1 on M such that g 0 = g1 + O(\u03c12 ). (Just take g 1 locally to be\nequal to the leading smooth terms in an asymptotic expansion for g 0 , and then patch together\nwith a partition of unity.) Let g1 = \u03c1\u22122\n0 g 1 . Because g1 is asymptotically hyperbolic and smoothly\nconformally compact, the argument of [12] shows that there is a smooth defining function \u03c1 such\nthat |d\u03c1|2g1 /\u03c12 \u2261 1. It follows that |d\u03c1|2g /\u03c12 = 1 + O(\u03c12 ). Let b\ng = \u03b9\u2217 g 0 = \u03b9\u2217 g 1 be the metric induced\non \u2202M by inclusion.\nGiven p \u2208 \u2202M , let (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) be Riemannian normal coordinates for gb on some neighborhood of p\nin \u2202M . Extend (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) to a neighborhood of p in M by declaring them to be constant along the\nintegral curves of the smooth vector field gradg1 \u03c1. It follows that (\u03c1, \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) are smooth coordinates\nin a neighborhood U of p, in which g 1 has an expression of the form\ng1 = d\u03c12 + (d\u03b8 1 )2 + (d\u03b8 2 )2 + mab (\u03c1, \u03b8)d\u03b8 a d\u03b8 b ,\n\n\u0001\nwith m00 , mj0 , and m0j identically zero, and mjk satisfying (21). Because g = \u03c1\u22122 g 1 + O(\u03c12 ) ,\nthis implies that g has the expansion claimed in the statement of the lemma. Since mab (0, 0) = 0,\nby shrinking U we may also ensure that the coefficients\n\u0001 mab are uniformly small in U , and thus g\n\u22122\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\nis uniformly equivalent to \u03c1 d\u03c1 + (d\u03b8 ) + (d\u03b8 ) there.\n\u0003\nFrom now on, we assume \u03c1 is a smooth defining function satisfying (18). We now argue that we\ncan choose \u03c1 so that it also satisfies\n\n(22)\n\n\u2206g \u03c1 \u2264 0 on M.\n\nOn any asymptotically hyperbolic 3-manifold, an easy computation (see, for example, [12, p. 199])\nshows that\n\u2206g \u03c1\n\u2192 \u22121 as \u03c1 \u2192 0.\n\u03c1\n\n\f10\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M.

To do so, we first\n\u0001 need to find an expression\nfor g\u03b5 along the lines of (19). Recall that \u011f := y \u22122 dy 2 + (dx1 )2 + (dx2 )2 is the metric of the upper\nhalf-space model of hyperbolic space. The inversion I(y, x) = (y/r 2 , x/r 2 ) is an isometry for this\nmodel: I \u2217 \u011f = \u011f. For i = 1, 2, we can write\n(35)\n\n(\u03b1\u03b5,i )\u2217 g = \u011f + mab,i (\u03b5y, \u03b5x)\n\ndxa dxb\n,\ny y\n\nwhere mab,i are the error terms from the expression (19) for g in preferred background coordinates\ncentered at pi . This metric is uniformly equivalent on A\u03b5 to \u011f; and because mab,i \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (U \u2229 M )\nand mab,i (0, 0) = 0, it is immediate that as \u03b5 \u2192 0, the C 2,\u03b1 norm of the functions mab,i (\u03b5y, \u03b5x) is\nO(\u03b5) on any subset of A\u03b5 where r is bounded above, including in particular the set where \u03c6 6= 1.\n(The C 2,\u03b1 norm in use here is the ordinary Euclidean one inherited from R3 .)\nTo analyze (\u03b2\u03b5 )\u2217 g = I \u2217 (\u03b1\u03b5,2 )\u2217 g, we compute, for a = 0, 1, 2,\n\u0012 2 ac\n\u0013\n\u0012 a\u0013 X\nr \u03b4 \u2212 2xa xc\ndxc\nac\n\u2217 dx\nac\n, where Q (y, x) =\n,\nI\n=\nQ (y, x)\ny\ny\nr2\nc\n\n\f14\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M.

Moreover,\nall of the derivatives of Qac are uniformly bounded on any subset of A\u03b5 where r is bounded below\nby a positive constant, such as the set where \u03c6 6= 0. Also, on any such subset, an easy argument\nshows that the C 2,\u03b1-norm of mab,2 (\u03b5y/r 2 , \u03b5x/r 2 ) is O(\u03b5) as \u03b5 \u2192 0.

Splicing the traceless part of the second fundamental form. Recall that our given\nsecond fundamental form on M can be written K = \u03bc + g, where \u03bc is a traceless, divergence-free\nsymmetric 2-tensor field of the form \u03bc = \u03c1\u22121 \u03bc for some \u03bc \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 (M ). Our goal in this section is to\ncreate on each M\u03b5 a traceless symmetric 2-tensor \u03bc\u03b5 that is \"approximately divergence-free,\" and\nsuch that \u03c0\u03b5\u2217 \u03bc\u03b5 is equal to \u03bc away from the neck. Later we will correct it so that it is divergence-free.\nLet \u03c7 : R \u2192 R be a smooth nonnegative function such that \u03c7(r) = 1 for r \u2265 3 and supp(\u03c7) \u2282\n(2, \u221e).

(The level sets of \u03c7\u03b5 are half-ellipsoids with radius proportional to \u03b5\nin the \u03c1 direction and to \u03b5 in the \u03b8-directions. We have designed this unusual cutoff function so\nthat the divergence of \u03bc\nb\u03b5 will be uniformly small, despite the fact that the tangential and normal\ncomponents of \u03bc vanish at different rates near the ideal boundary; see Lemma 18 for details.)\n\u0001\nIt follows from our choice of \u03c7\u03b5 that \u03bc\nb\u03b5 is supported in the set M \\ B 2\u03b5,1 \u222a B 2\u03b5,2 . Because\n\u03c0\u03b5 restricts to a diffeomorphism from this set to an open subset of M\u03b5 , we can define a symmetric\n2-tensor \u03bc\u03b5 on M\u03b5 by\n(50)\n\n\u03bc\u03b5 = \u03c0\u03b5\u2217 \u03bc\nb\u03b5 ,\n\nunderstood to be zero on the neck. Because g\u03b5 = \u03c0\u03b5\u2217 g on the support of \u03bc\u03b5 , and \u03bc\u03b5 is a scalar\nmultiple of \u03c0\u03b5\u2217 \u03bc, it follows that \u03bc\u03b5 is traceless with respect to g\u03b5 . Although it is generaly not\ndivergence-free, we will show below that its divergence is not too large (see Lemma 18).\n5. Analysis on the Spliced Manifolds\nIn this section we develop the results we will need about linear elliptic operators on our spliced\nmanifolds.\n5.1. Weighted H\u00f6lder spaces and linear differential operators. To carry out the needed\nanalysis on AH geometries with AH data, and also to provide a convenient framework for specifying\nthe rate at which various quantities like the trace free part of K approach their requisite asymptotic\nvalues, it is convenient to work with weighted H\u00f6lder spaces. Here we recall the definition of these\nspaces, using the conventions of [18].\nSuppose (M, g) is an asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian geometry of class C l,\u03b2 and \u03c1 is a\nsmooth defining function. (Our polyhomogeneous metrics, for example, are automatically asymptotically hyperbolic of class C 2,\u03b1 for every \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).) Let (\u03c1, \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) be background coordinates on\nan open subset U \u2282 M , which we may assume extend to a neighborhood of the closure of U in M .\nLet B\u0306 \u2282 H3 be a fixed precompact ball containing (1, 0, 0). A M\u00f6bius chart for M (or more accurately a M\u00f6bius parametrization) is a diffeomorphism \u03a6 : B\u0306 \u2192 U whose coordinate representation\nhas the form\n(\u03c1, \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) = \u03a6(y, x) = (ay, ax1 + b1 , ax2 + b2 )\nfor some constants (a, b1 , b2 ). There is a neighborhood W of \u2202M in M covered by finitely many\nbackground charts, and then the resulting family of M\u00f6bius charts covers W \u2229 M . We extend this\n\n\f18\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M. LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\ncover to all of M by choosing finitely many interior charts, which we also call M\u00f6bius charts for\nuniformity, to cover M r W .\nLet E be a tensor bundle over M . For any nonnegative integer k and real number \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]\nsuch that k + \u03b1 \u2264 l + \u03b2, we define the intrinsic H\u00f6lder space C k,\u03b1(M ; E) as the set of sections u of\nE whose coefficients are locally of class C k,\u03b1, and for which the following norm is finite:\nkukk,\u03b1 = sup k\u03a6\u2217 ukC k,\u03b1 (B\u0306) ,\n\u03a6\n\nwhere the supremum is over our collection of M\u00f6bius charts, and the norm on the right-hand side\nis the usual Euclidean H\u00f6lder norm of the components of a tensor field on B\u0306. For any real number\n\u03b4, we define the corresponding weighted H\u00f6lder space by\nC\u03b4k,\u03b1(M ; E) = {\u03c1\u03b4 u : u \u2208 C k,\u03b1(M ; E)},\nwith norm\nkukk,\u03b1,\u03b4 = k\u03c1\u2212\u03b4 ukk,\u03b1 .\n\nWhen the tensor bundle is clear from the context, we will usually abbreviate the notation by writing\nC\u03b4k,\u03b1(M ) instead of C\u03b4k,\u03b1(M ; E). The index \u03b4 labels the rate of asymptotic decay of a given quantity,\nmeasured in terms of the intrinsic (asymptotically hyperbolic) Riemannian metric g. In particular,\nwe note that larger positive values of \u03b4 imply more rapid decay. It is shown in [18, Lemma 3.7]\nthat if \u03b7 is any covariant r-tensor field on M with coefficients in background coordinates that are\nC k,\u03b1 up to the ideal boundary, then \u03b7 \u2208 Crk,\u03b1(M ). Similarly, any vector field with coefficients that\nk,\u03b1\nare C k,\u03b1 up to the ideal boundary lies in C\u22121\n(M ).\nA linear partial differential operator P of order m between tensor bundles is said to be geometric\nif the components of P u in any coordinates can be expressed as linear functions of the components\nof u and their covariant derivatives of order at most m, with coefficients that are constant-coefficient\np\npolynomials in the dimension, the components of g, their partial derivatives, and 1/ det gij , such\nthat the coefficient of each jth derivative of u involves at most the first m \u2212 j derivatives of g. The\noperators \u2206g (the Laplace-Beltrami operator), divg (the divergence), Dg (the conformal Killing\noperator), Dg\u2217 (the adjoint of Dg ), and Lg (the vector Laplacian) introduced above are all examples\nof geometric operators. It is shown by Mazzeo [20] (see also [18]) that every geometric operator P\nof order m on an asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian geometry of class C l,\u03b2 defines a bounded\nlinear map from C\u03b4k,\u03b1(M ) to C\u03b4k\u2212m,\u03b1(M ):\n(51)\n\nkP ukk\u2212m,\u03b1,\u03b4 \u2264 Ckukk,\u03b1,\u03b4 ,\n\nwhenever m \u2264 k + \u03b1 \u2264 l + \u03b2; and moreover, if P is also elliptic, then it satisfies the following\nelliptic estimate for 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and m < k + \u03b1 \u2264 l + \u03b2:\n\u0001\n(52)\nkukk,\u03b1,\u03b4 \u2264 C kP ukk\u2212m,\u03b1,\u03b4 + kuk0,0,\u03b4 .\n\nBecause our spliced manifolds (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 ) are polyhomogeneous and asymptotically hyperbolic of\nclass C 2 , they are also asymptotically hyperbolic of class C 2,\u03b1 for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), and thus\nthe results we have just discussed hold on M\u03b5 for each \u03b5, with (l, \u03b2) = (2, \u03b1). However, for\nour subsequent analysis, we need to check that the constants in (51) and (52) can be chosen\nindependently of \u03b5 when \u03b5 is sufficiently small. Threading through the arguments of [18], we see\nthat for a given geometric operator P , the constants depend only on uniform bounds of the following\ntype as \u03a6 ranges over a collection of M\u00f6bius charts covering M :\n(53)\n\nk\u03a6\u2217 g \u2212 \u011fkC 2,\u03b1 (B\u0306) \u2264 C,\n\nsup (\u03a6\u2217 g)\u22121 \u011f \u2264 C.\nB\u0306\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n19\n\n(In [18], attention is restricted to a countable, uniformly locally finite family of M\u00f6bius charts, but\nthat additional restriction is used only for Sobolev estimates, which do not concern us here.) In fact,\nit is not necessary to use M\u00f6bius charts per se, in which the first background coordinate is exactly\nequal to \u03c1; the arguments of [18] show that it is sufficient to use any family of parametrizations\n\u03a6 satisfying (53), as long as there is a precompact subset B\u03060 of B\u0306 such that the images of the\nrestrictions \u03a6|B\u03060 still cover M , and the following uniform estimates hold in addition to (53):\n(54)\n\nk\u03a6\u2217 \u03c1kC 2,\u03b1 (B\u0306) \u2264 C\u03c10 ,\n\n1\n\u03c10 \u2264 |\u03a6\u2217 \u03c1| \u2264 C\u03c10 ,\nC\n\nwhere \u03c10 = \u03a6\u2217 \u03c1(1, 0, 0). Thus to obtain our uniform estimates, we need only exhibit a family of\ncharts for each \u03b5 such that the corresponding estimates hold for g = g\u03b5 and \u03c1 = \u03c1\u03b5 , with constants\nindependent of \u03b5.\nStart with the family of all M\u00f6bius charts for M . On the portion of M\u03b5 away from the neck,\nthese same charts (composed with \u03c0\u03b5 ; see Definition 4) serve as charts for M\u03b5 , which satisfy (53)\nand (54) uniformly in \u03b5. Recall that we use the diffeomorphism \u03a8\u03b5 : A\u03b5 \u2192 N\u03b5 to parametrize the\nneck. Because \u03a8\u2217\u03b5 g\u03b5 is isometric to g except on a subset of A1/2 \u2282 A\u03b5 , we need only show how to\nconstruct appropriate charts covering points in \u03a8\u03b5 (A1/2 ).\nOn this set, we will use standard coordinates on A1/2 as a substitute for background coordinates.\nGiven p = \u03a8\u03b5 (y0 , x10 , x20 ) \u2208 \u03a8\u03b5 (A1/2 ), we define \u03a6p = \u03a8\u03b5 \u25e6 \u03c6p : B\u0306 \u2192 N\u03b5 , where \u03c6p : B\u0306 \u2192 A\u03b5 is the\nmap\n\u03c6p (x, y) = (y0 y, y0 x1 + x10 , y0 x2 + x20 ).\nNote that the Jacobian of \u03c6p is y0 times the identity. Under this map, (37) shows that g\u03b5 pulls\nback to\ndxa dxb\n\u03a6\u2217p g\u03b5 = \u011f + kab,\u03b5 (y0 y, y0 x1 + x10 , y0 x2 + x20 )\n,\ny y\nwhere we recall that \u011f is the metric of the upper half space model of hyperbolic space. If we assume\nthat \u03b5 is small enough that \u03c6p (B\u0306) \u2282 A1/4 , these metrics satisfy the estimates in (53) uniformly in\n\u03b5 because the functions kab,\u03b5 are uniformly small in C 2,\u03b1 norm on A1/4 . The defining function \u03c1\u03b5\npulls back to\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u2217p \u03c1\u03b5 (~x) = \u03b5y0 yF |\u03c6p (~x)| ,\n\u0001\nand \u03a6\u2217p \u03c1\u03b5 (1, 0, 0) = \u03b5y0 F |(y0 , x10 , x20 )| . Because F is uniformly bounded above and below on A1/4\nby positive constants, and all of its derivatives are uniformly bounded there, it follows that the\nfunctions \u03a6\u2217p \u03c1\u03b5 satisfy the estimates in (54) uniformly in \u03b5.\nSummarizing the discussion above, we have proved\nProposition 11. Suppose P is a geometric operator of order m \u2264 2 acting on sections of a tensor\nbundle E \u2192 M , and for each \u03b5 > 0, P\u03b5 is the corresponding operator on M\u03b5 .

In this section, we study the kernel of the\nvector Laplacian L\u011f = D\u011f\u2217 \u25e6 D\u011f on hyperbolic space (H3 , \u011f). We denote the standard coordinates\n\u0001\nby (y, x) = (y, x1 , x2 ) = (x0 , x1 , x2 ) on H3 , and we use the notations |x| = (x1 )2 + (x2 )2 1/2 and\n\u0001\nr = |~x| = |x|2 + y 2 1/2 . As a global defining function on H3 , we use\n\u03c1\u0306(y, x1 , x2 ) =\n\n|x|2\n\n2y\n.\n+ (y + 1)2\n\nThe function \u03c1\u0306 is the pullback to the upper half-space of the usual defining function 21 (1 \u2212 |x|2 ) on\nthe unit ball.\nIt is well known (see, for example, [15] or [18]) that the vector Laplacian\nL\u011f : C\u03b42,\u03b1 (H3 ) \u2192 C\u03b40,\u03b1(H3 )\nis invertible for \u22121 < \u03b4 < 3 and 0 < \u03b1 < 1.

If \u22121 < \u03b4 < 3, then there is no nonzero global vector field X on H3 satisfying both\nL\u011f X = 0 and the estimate |X|\u011f \u2264 C \u03c1\u0306\u03b4 .\nProof. The hypothesis implies that X \u2208 C\u03b40,0 (H3 ), and then Lemma 4.8(b) of [18] implies that\nX \u2208 C\u03b42,\u03b1 (H3 ) for 0 < \u03b1 < 1. The result then follows from the injectivity of L\u011f on the latter\nspace.\n\u0003\nWe need some variations on this result, in which the defining function \u03c1\u0306 is replaced by other\nweight functions. As in Section 4.3, let \u03be : H3 \u2192 R be the function \u03be(y, x) = yF (r), where F is the\nfunction of Lemma 7. We noted earlier that \u03be \u25e6 I = \u03be, where I : H3 \u2192 H3 is the \u011f-isometry given\nby inversion with respect to the unit hemisphere. Away from 0 and \u221e, \u03be is a defining function for\n\u2202H3 , but it blows up at both 0 and \u221e.\nProposition 13. If \u22121 < \u03b4 < 3, then there is no nonzero global vector field X on H3 satisfying\nboth L\u011f X = 0 and the estimate |X|\u011f \u2264 C\u03be \u03b4 .\nProof. Suppose X is a nonzero vector field on H3 satisfying L\u011f X = 0 and |X|\u011f \u2264 C\u03be \u03b4 for some\n\u22121 < \u03b4 < 3. As a consequence of the behavior of the metric \u011f near the ideal boundary, the\ncomponents of X in standard coordinates on H3 satisfy the condition |X a | \u2264 Cy\u03be \u03b4 .\nLet \u03c6 : R2 \u2192 R be a smooth bump function supported in the set where |x| \u2264 12 and satisfying\n0 \u2264 \u03c6(x) \u2264 1, and define a smooth vector field Y = (Y 0 , Y 1 , Y 2 ) on H3 by\nZ\na\nX a (y, x \u2212 u)\u03c6(u) du.\n(55)\nY (y, x) =\nR2\n\nDifferentiation under the integral sign shows that L\u011f Y = 0.\nWe show first that on the set where r \u2264 1, Y satisfies an estimate of the form |Y |\u011f \u2264 Cy s for\nsome s with \u22121 < s < 3.

On the other hand, if r \u2265 1 and |u| \u2264 12 ,\nthen we have |(y, x \u2212 u)| \u223c |(y, x)| and \u03be(y, x \u2212 u) \u223c \u03be(y, x), where \u223c means \"bounded above and\nbelow by constant multiples of.\" It follows easily that |Y a | \u2264 Cy\u03be \u03b4 , and therefore |Y |\u011f \u2264 C\u03be \u03b4 on\nthis set.\nNow let Ye be the vector field Ye = I\u2217 Y .

After a translation in the x-variables (which is an isometry of H3 ), we may assume that\nx0 = 0. There is some ball Br (0) \u2282 R2 such that X a (y0 , x) does not change sign for x \u2208 Br (0).\nIf \u03c6 is chosen to be supported in this ball, it follows from (55) that Y a (y0 , 0) 6= 0. Repeating this\nargument with Y in place of X shows that there is a point at which Z 6= 0. This is a contradiction,\nso we conclude that X \u2261 0 as claimed.\n\u0003\nWe also need the following consequence of this result, in which the weight function is taken to\nbe the vertical coordinate y.\nCorollary 14. If \u22121 < \u03b4 < 3, then there is no nonzero global vector field X on H3 satisfying both\nL\u011f X = 0 and the estimate |X|\u011f \u2264 Cy \u03b4 .\nProof. If \u03b4 \u2265 0, this follows from the previous proposition and the fact that y \u2264 C\u03be. If \u03b4 < 0, then\nit follows from Lemma 12 and the fact that y \u2265 C \u03c1\u0306.\n\u0003\n5.3. The Vector Laplacian on the Spliced Manifolds. We now consider the vector Laplacians\non our spliced manifolds. For each \u03b5 > 0, let (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 ) be the asymptotically hyperbolic spliced\nmanifold defined in Definitions 4 and 6, and let L\u03b5 := Lg\u03b5 be its corresponding vector Laplacian.\nSince g\u03b5 is asymptotically hyperbolic of class C 2,\u03b1 for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), the analysis in [15] or [18]\nshows that L\u03b5 : C\u03b42,\u03b1(M\u03b5 ) \u2192 C\u03b40,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) is invertible so long as \u03b5 > 0 and \u22121 < \u03b4 < 3. We need to\nshow that the norm of its inverse is bounded uniformly in \u03b5. The main goal of this section is to\nunderstand this uniformity.\nFix \u03b1 as above and \u03b4 \u2208 (\u22121, 3). We start with the uniform Schauder estimate (see Proposition\n11)\n\u0001\n(56)\nkXk2,\u03b1,\u03b4 \u2264 C kL\u03b5 Xk0,\u03b1,\u03b4 + kXk0,0,\u03b4 ,\n\nwhere C is some constant independent of \u03b5. We will show that there is a uniform constant D such\nthat for sufficiently small \u03b5\n(57)\n\nkXk0,0,\u03b4 \u2264 DkL\u03b5 Xk0,0,\u03b4 .\n\nThis last estimate implies that kXk2,\u03b1,\u03b4 \u2264 C(D + 1)kL\u03b5 Xk0,\u03b1,\u03b4 ; i.e., that the norm of the inverse\n(L\u03b5 )\u22121 is bounded above by 1/(C(D + 1)).\nWe use blow-up analysis to prove (57). The main ingredient in the analysis is the following\nlemma.\nLemma 15. Let (\u03a3, \u03b3) be an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold, and let {Nj } be a sequence of\nopen subsets of \u03a3 such that every compact subset of \u03a3 is contained in Nj for all but finitely many\nj. Suppose that for each j we are given a Riemannian metric gj on Nj such that gj \u2192 \u03b3 uniformly\nwith two derivatives on every compact subset of \u03a3. Assume furthermore thatTthere exist vector\nfields Yj on Nj , a positive real-valued function \u03b6 on \u03a3, a compact subset K0 \u2282 j Nj , and positive\nconstants C1 , C2 such that\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n23\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(a) inf \u03b6 \u2212\u03b4 |Yj |gj \u2265 C2 ;\nK0 \u0010\n\u0011\n(b) sup \u03b6 \u2212\u03b4 |Yj |gj \u2264 C1 ;\nNj\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(c) sup \u03b6 \u2212\u03b4 |Lgj Yj |gj \u2192 0.\nNj\n\nThen there exist a C \u221e vector field Y on \u03a3 and a constant C3 for which\nL\u03b3 Y = 0,\n\n|Y |\u03b3 \u2264 C3 \u03b6 \u03b4 ,\n\nY 6\u2261 0.\n\nb be a slightly larger precompact open set\nProof. Let K \u2282 \u03a3 be a precompact open set, and let K\nb (with two derivatives) to \u03b3, we may\ncontaining K. Since the metrics gj converge uniformly on K\nb\nassume that the following estimates hold on K when j is sufficiently large:\n|Yj |\u03b3 \u2264 2C1 \u03b6 \u03b4 ,\n\n|L\u03b3 Yj |\u03b3 \u2264 C\u03b6 \u03b4 ,\n\nfor some constant C independent of j. The function \u03b6 is bounded above and below by positive\nb so it follows that kYj k 0,p b and kL\u03b3 Yj k 0,p b are bounded uniformly in j.\nconstants on K,\nH (K,\u03b3)\nH (K,\u03b3)\nSobolev estimates now imply that\nkYj kH 2,p (K,\u03b3) \u2264 CK ,\nfor some new constant CK depending on K but independent of j.\nBy the Rellich Lemma there exists a subsequence Yjn ,K of Yj that converges in H 1,p (K, \u03b3). For\np > 3, we have a Sobolev embedding H 1,p (K, \u03b3) \u2192 C 0,0 (K, \u03b3). This means that there exists a\npointwise limit\nYK := lim Yjn,K\njn \u2192\u221e\n\nC 0,0 (K, \u03b3).\n\nwhere YK \u2208\nNote that by construction |YK |\u03b3 \u2264 2C1 \u03b6 \u03b4 on K.\nConsider a nested sequence of precompact open sets whose union is \u03a3:\nK1 \u2282 K 1 \u2282 K2 \u2282 K 2 \u2282 K3 \u2282 K 3 . . . .\n\nWe may use the process outlined above to inductively construct sequences Yjn,Km for each Km ,\nsuch that the sequence Yjn ,Km is a subsequence of Yjn ,Km\u22121 that converges uniformly on Km . The\ndiagonal sequence Yjn ,Kn converges uniformly on every compact subset of \u03a3 to a continuous limit\nY on \u03a3 that satisfies |Y |\u03b3 \u2264 2C1 \u03b6 \u03b4 . The assumption (a) ensures that Y 6\u2261 0. So, it remains to\nshow that L\u03b3 Y = 0.\nLet X be a compactly supported test vector field on \u03a3. Since gjn converges to \u03b3 uniformly on\nsupp X with two derivatives, we have\nZ\nZ\nhL\u03b3 X, Y i\u03b3 dV\u03b3 = lim\nLgjn X, Yjn ,Kn \u03b3 dV\u03b3\njn \u2192\u221e \u03a3\n\u03a3\nZ\nX, Lgjn Yjn ,Kn \u03b3 dV\u03b3 = 0.\n= lim\njn \u2192\u221e \u03a3\n\nThus Y is a weak solution to L\u03b3 Y = 0, and it follows from elliptic regularity that Y \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3) and\nL\u03b3 Y = 0.\n\u0003\nWe now focus on verifying inequality (57).\nLemma 16.

Passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume\nthat qj \u2192 q \u2208 M . Our proof now splits into several cases depending on the location of q. Each\ncase culminates in a contradiction.\nCase 1: q \u2208 M . This is the easiest of the cases as it allows immediate use of Lemma 15.\nIndeed, let (\u03a3, \u03b3) = (M, g), Nj = \u03a9\u03b5j /3 , gj \u2261 g, \u03b6 \u2261 \u03c1, and let K0 be a compact set containing\na small neighborhood of q. Vector fields Yj on Nj for which (\u03c0\u03b5j )\u2217 Yj = Xj necessarily satisfy the\nhypotheses of Lemma 15. Thus there exists a C \u221e nonzero vector field Y on M with Lg Y = 0 and\n|Y |g = O(\u03c1\u03b4 ). However, for \u03b4 \u2208 (\u22121, 3), the vector Laplacian has no kernel in C\u03b40,0 (M ), so this is a\ncontradiction.\nCase 2: q \u2208 \u2202M r {p1 , p2 }. Let \u03b8~ := (\u03c1, \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ) be a set of preferred background coordinates\ncentered at q, which we may assume to be defined on a half-disk D \u2282 M whose coordinate radius\nis R. Let (\u03c1j , \u03b8j1 , \u03b8j2 ) be the coordinates of qj , j \u226b 0. Note that (\u03c1j , \u03b8j1 , \u03b8j2 ) \u2192 (0, 0, 0) as j \u2192 \u221e.\nLet (\u03a3, \u03b3) be the hyperbolic space (H3 , \u011f). We define Nj to be the half-ball in H3 centered at\n(0, \u2212\u03b8j1 /\u03c1j , \u2212\u03b8j2 /\u03c1j ) of (Euclidean) radius R/\u03c1j . As soon as j is large enough that |~\u03b8j | < R/2, the\ntriangle inequality\nS shows that the half-ball of radius R/2\u03c1j centered at (0, 0, 0) is contained in Nj ,\nso we see that j Nj = \u03a3 and that each compact subset of M is contained in Nj for all but finitely\nmany j.\nConsider the transformations Tj : Nj \u2192 M whose coordinate representations are given by\n(59)\n\nTj (y, x1 , x2 ) = (\u03c1j y, \u03c1j x1 + \u03b8j1 , \u03c1j x2 + \u03b8j2 ).\n\nThese transformations are chosen so that Tj (1, 0, 0) = qj . We will now construct metrics and vector\nfields on Nj satisfying the hypothesis of Lemma 15.\nFirst, let gj := Tj\u2217 g. It follows easily from Lemma 3 that gj \u2192 \u011f uniformly on compact sets\ntogether with two derivatives.\n\u2217\nNow define Yj := \u03c1\u2212\u03b4\nj Tj Xj .

It follows\nthat there is a nonzero vector field Y on H3 for which L\u011f Y = 0 and |Y |\u011f = O(y \u03b4 ). For \u03b4 \u2208 (\u22121, 3)\nthis is impossible by Corollary 14.\nCase 3: q \u2208 {p1 , p2 }; without loss of generality we may assume that q = p1 .

It follows from the fact that qj \u2208 \u03a9\u03b5/3 that rj > 31 .\nThere are several different ways in which qj can converge to p1 .

It is immediate that j Nj = \u03a3,\nand that every compact set in \u03a3 is contained in almost all Nj . It follows from (37) that gj \u2192 \u011f\nuniformly on compact sets together with two derivatives.\nConsider the function \u03be(y, x) = yF (r) and vector fields Yj such that (\u03a8\u03b5j )\u2217 Yj = \u03b5\u2212\u03b4\nj Xj .

The arguments of Section 5.1 show that D\u03b5 is\nbounded from C\u03b42,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) to C\u03b41,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) uniformly in \u03b5, and therefore (63) is satisfied. It now remains\nto show that \u03bd\u03b5 is polyhomogeneous and that \u03c12\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b5 has a C 2 extension to M \u03b5 which vanishes on the\nideal boundary.\nWe start by observing that the right hand side of (64) is polyhomogeneous and that, by Theorem\n6.3.10 of [1], there exists a polyhomogeneous solution X\u03b5phg of (64). Since \u03bc has an asymptotic\nexpansion beginning with \u03c1\u22121 and the first log term (if any) appearing with \u03c1s , s > 0, a computation\nshows that the vector field on the right-hand side of (64) has an expansion beginning with a \u03c12\u03b5\nterm, s > 0. Inserting the general\nterm, and with the first log terms (if any) appearing in the \u03c1s+3\n\u03b5\nphg\nasymptotic expansion for X\u03b5 into (64) and matching like terms inductively, we conclude that\nX\u03b5phg has an asymptotic expansion beginning with \u03c12\u03b5 and the first log terms appearing with \u03c1s+3\n\u03b5 ,\n4\ns > 0. (Note that the first log terms which arise from the indicial roots of L\u03b5 appear with \u03c1\u03b5 .) On\nthe other hand, X\u03b5 \u2208 C12,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) implies that its component functions in background coordinates are\nalso O(\u03c12\u03b5 ). The uniqueness part of Theorem 6.3.10 in [1] implies that X\u03b5 = X\u03b5phg . It now follows\neasily that \u03bd\u03b5 is polyhomogeneous and that is has an asymptotic expansion starting with \u03c1\u22121\n\u03b5 and\nthe first log term appearing with \u03c1s\u03b5 , s > 0. Thus the extension of \u03c12\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b5 to M \u03b5 is actually of class\nC 2 and vanishes on the ideal boundary, which is just what is needed for \u03bd\u03b5 to be the traceless part\nof the second fundamental form for a polyhomogeneous AH initial data set (see Definition 1). \u0003\n\n\f30\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M. LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\n7. The Lichnerowicz Equation and Conformal Deformation to the Spliced\nSolutions of the Constraint Equations\nThus far, starting with a set of asymptotically hyperbolic, polyhomogeoneous, constant mean\ncurvature initial data (M, g, K) satisfying the Einstein constraint equations, together with a pair of\npoints {p1 , p2 } both contained in the ideal boundary \u2202M , we have first produced a one-parameter\nfamily of spliced data sets (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , \u03bc\u03b5 ) which are asymptotically hyperbolic, polyhomogeneous,\nCMC, and not solutions of the constraints, and we have then corrected \u03bc\u03b5 to a new family of\nsymmetric tensors \u03bd\u03b5 which are all divergence free as well as trace free with respect to g\u03b5 . We\nhave verified that outside of the gluing region, \u03bd\u03b5 approaches the original trace free part of K in\nan appropriate sense.\nTo complete our gluing construction, we will now carry out a one-parameter family of conformal\ndeformations that transform the data (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , \u03bd\u03b5 , \u03c4 = 3) to a family of data sets (M\u03b5 , \u03c8\u03b54 g\u03b5 , \u03c8\u03b5\u22122 \u03bd\u03b5 +\n\u03c8\u03b54 g\u03b5 ) satisfying the desired properties of the gluing construction (including the constraint equations) for all \u03b5. Following the principles of the conformal method outlined in Section 2.2, if we want\nthe conformally transformed data sets to satisfy the constraints, then the conformal functions \u03c8\u03b5\nmust solve the Lichnerowicz equation (14), which for the data (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , \u03bd\u03b5 , \u03c4 = 3) takes the form\nL\u03b5 (\u03c8\u03b5 ) = 0, where\n(65)\n\n1\n3\n1\nL\u03b5 (u) := \u2206g\u03b5 u \u2212 R(g\u03b5 )u + |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 u\u22127 \u2212 u5 .\n8\n8\n4\n\nHence, we need to do the following: prove that for each \u03b5 the Lichnerowicz equation (65) does\nadmit a positive solution \u03c8\u03b5 which is polyhomogeneous and C 2 up to the ideal boundary, prove\nthat \u03c8\u03b5 approaches 1 at the ideal boundary (so that the resulting Riemannian manifold is AH) and\nprove that as \u03b5 \u2192 0 the solutions \u03c8\u03b5 approach 1 away from the gluing region. We carry out these\nproofs here.\nThe first step in our proof that, for the data sets (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , \u03bd\u03b5 , \u03c4 = 3), the Lichnerowicz equation\nadmits solutions with the desired asymptotic properties, is to estimate the extent to which the\nconstant function \u03c80 \u2261 1 fails to be a solution of (65). While it is relatively straightforward to\nshow that L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) is an element of the weighted H\u00f6lder space C10,\u03b1(M\u03b5 ), we have been unsuccessful\nin proving that the corresponding norm of L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) is \"small\". Consequently, we are able to find a\nsolution \u03c8\u03b5 of the Lichnerowicz equation such that \u03c8\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c80 \"vanishes\" on \u2202M \u03b5 but we are only able\nto obtain good estimates on \u03c8\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c80 in C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ). This, however, is sufficient to prove our main\nresult.\n\u221a\nLemma 20. We have L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) \u2208 C10,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) and kL\u03b5 (\u03c80 )k0,\u03b1 = O( \u03b5) as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nProof. Note that \u03c80 \u2261 1 yields\nL\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\nR(g\u03b5 ) + 6 \u2212 |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 .\n8\n\nThe fact that L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) \u2208 C10,\u03b1(M\u03b5 ) is immediate from |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 \u2208 C10,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) which is true by construction,\nand (R(g\u03b5 ) + 6) \u2208 C10,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) which is true by virtue of (47) and Lemma 9. To estimate the\nunweighted norm of L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ), let \u03a6 be one of our preferred charts for\n\u0001 M\u03b5 (see Section 5.1). If the\nimage of \u03a6 is away from the gluing region, i.e., if \u03a6(B\u0306) \u2229 \u03a8\u03b5 A\u221a\u03b5/3 = \u2205, then\n\u221a\nk\u03a6\u2217 L\u03b5 (\u03c80 )kC 0,\u03b1 (B\u0306) = 18 k\u03a6\u2217 (|\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 \u2212 |\u03bc\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 )kC 0,\u03b1 (B\u0306) = O( \u03b5)\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n31\n\nas a consequence of the second constraint equation R(g) \u2212 |K|2g + \u03c4 2 = R(g) \u2212 |\u03bc|2g + 6 = 0 and\n(63).

The uniformity\n\u221a\nproperties (54) and the fact that \u03c1\u03b5 \u2264 \u03b5/c on \u03a8\u03b5 Ac\u221a\u03b5 imply that\n\u221a\nk\u03a6\u2217 (R(g\u03b5 ) + 6)kC 0,\u03b1 (B\u0306) = O( \u03b5).\n\n(66)\n\nTo understand the \u03bc\u03b5 -term, note that \u03c0\u03b5 is a diffeomorphism on the support of \u03bc\nb\u03b5 , where we also\nhave\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bc\nb\u03b5 g \u2264 \u03bc g = \u03c12 \u03bc \u1e21 .\nIt then follows that sup \u03a6\u2217 |\u03bc\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 = O(\u03b5).

There are many ways to circumvent this; for\nconvenience, we will base our argument on Proposition 3.7 of [12]. First we need the following\nuniform estimate (called the \"basic estimate\" in [12]). This estimate is analogous to the estimate\nof Lemma 16 above for the vector Laplacian. The proofs of the two lemmas, however, are quite\ndifferent: Lemma 16 is proved using blow-up analysis, while the proof of the next lemma is direct\nand constructive. Consequently, the next lemma features a more optimal result on C (as opposed\nto the vector Laplacian case where we are only able to prove the existence of C).\nLemma 22.

The operators P\u03b5 : C12,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) \u2192 C10,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) and P\u03b5 : C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) \u2192 C 0,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) are\ninvertible for sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0. The norm of the inverse of P\u03b5 : C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) \u2192 C 0,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) is\nbounded uniformly in \u03b5.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 3.7 in [12] (together with Lemma 22) that P\u03b5 is invertible when\n\u03b5 is small enough, so it remains only to prove uniformity of the norm. We start by establishing a\nuniform elliptic estimate\n(75)\n\nkuk2,\u03b1 \u2264 C (kP\u03b5 uk0,\u03b1 + kuk0,0 )\n\nin which C is independent of (sufficiently small) \u03b5 > 0. Let \u03a6 be one of our preferred charts for M\u03b5\n(see section 5.1). Consider the elliptic operator P\u03a6,\u03b5 : C 2,\u03b1 (B\u0306) \u2192 C 0,\u03b1(B\u0306) defined by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP\u03a6,\u03b5 := \u2206\u03a6\u2217 g\u03b5 \u2212 \u03a6\u2217 3 + |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 \u2212 L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) ;\n\n\f34\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M. LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\nthis operator is of interest since\n\u03a6\u2217 (P\u03b5 u) = P\u03a6,\u03b5 \u03a6\u2217 u.\nRecall that the metric \u03a6\u2217 g\u03b5 is uniformly equivalent to the hyperbolic metric \u011f. Furthermore, we see\nfrom Lemma 20 and (67) that the C 0,\u03b1 (B\u0306)-norms of \u03a6\u2217 |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 and \u03a6\u2217 L\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) are uniformly bounded.\nThus, the eigenvalues of the principal symbol of P\u03a6,\u03b5 are uniformly bounded from below, while the\nC 0,\u03b1 (B\u0306)-norms of the coefficients of P\u03a6,\u03b5 are uniformly bounded from above. Let B\u03060 be a fixed\nprecompact subset of B\u0306 such that the restrictions of our preferred charts to B\u03060 still cover M\u03b5 . It\nfollows from the standard elliptic theory [11] that there is a constant C (independent of \u03b5, \u03a6 and\nu) such that\n\u0010\n\u0011\nk\u03a6\u2217 ukC 2,\u03b1 (B\u03060 ) \u2264 C kP\u03a6,\u03b5 \u03a6\u2217 ukC 2,\u03b1 (B\u0306) + k\u03a6\u2217 ukC 0,0 (B\u0306) .\n\nTaking the supremum with respect to \u03a6 now yields (75).\nNext, we combine Lemma 22 and the elliptic estimate (75). We conclude that there is a constant\nC (independent of \u03b5) such that\nkuk2,\u03b1 \u2264 CkP\u03b5 uk0,\u03b1\n2,\u03b1\nfor all u \u2208 C (M\u03b5 ). This shows that the norm of P\u03b5\u22121 : C 0,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) \u2192 C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) is bounded\nindependently of \u03b5.\n\u0003\n\nWe solve the Lichnerowicz equation by interpreting it as a fixed point problem.

In what follows we argue that G\u03b5 is a contraction mapping from a small ball\nin C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) to itself.\nLemma 24. For sufficiently\nlarge C and sufficiently small \u03b5, the map G\u03b5 is a contraction of the\n\u221a\nclosed ball of radius C \u03b5 around 0 in C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ).\n\u221a\nProof. Let \u03b71 , \u03b72 \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) be of norm O( \u03b5). Assuming in addition that |\u03b71 | < 1 and |\u03b72 | < 1,\nusing the bound on |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 expressed in (67), and using the binomial expansion formulae, we find\nthat for sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0,\nh\ni\n1\nkQ\u03b5 (\u03b72 ) \u2212 Q\u03b5 (\u03b71 )k0,\u03b1 =\n|\u03bd\u03b5 |2 (1 + \u03b71 )\u22127 \u2212 (1 + \u03b72 )\u22127 + 7(\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 )\n8\ni\n3h\n\u2212 (1 + \u03b71 )5 \u2212 (1 + \u03b72 )5 \u2212 5(\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 )\n4\n0,\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2264 O( \u03b5)k\u03b72 \u2212 \u03b71 k0,\u03b1 \u2264 O( \u03b5)k\u03b72 \u2212 \u03b71 k2,\u03b1 .\n\u221a\nA similar calculation shows that if k\u03b7k2,\u03b1\u221a= O( \u03b5) then kQ\u03b5 (\u03b7)k0,\u03b1 = O(\u03b5). As a consequence\nof Lemma 20, functions \u03b7 with k\u03b7k2,\u03b1 = O( \u03b5) also satisfy\n\u221a\nkL\u03b5 (\u03c80 ) + Q\u03b5 (\u03b7)k0,\u03b1 = O( \u03b5).\n\n\fASYMPTOTIC GLUING\n\n35\n\nCombining this with Theorem 23 we have that there is a sufficiently large constant C > 0 such\nthat for sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0\n\u0001\n\u221a\nkG\u03b5 (\u03b7)k2,\u03b1 = (P\u03b5 )\u22121 L\u03b5 (1) + Q\u03b5 (\u03b7) 2,\u03b1 \u2264 C \u03b5.\nThus we have determined that G\u03b5 : B C \u221a\u03b5 \u2192 B C \u221a\u03b5 .\nTo see that this map is a contraction, we compute\n\n\u0001\nkG\u03b5 (\u03b71 ) \u2212 G\u03b5 (\u03b72 )k2,\u03b1 = (P\u03b5 )\u22121 Q\u03b5 (\u03b71 ) \u2212 Q\u03b5 (\u03b72 )\n\nIt thus follows that if \u03b5 > 0 is small enough, the map G\u03b5 : B C\n\n2,\u03b1\n\u221a\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u221a\n= O( \u03b5)k\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 k2,\u03b1 .\n\n\u2192 B C \u221a\u03b5 is a contraction.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe are now ready to state and prove our main result regarding solutions of the Lichnerowicz\nequation for the parametrized sets of conformal data (M\u03b5 , g\u03b5 , \u03bd\u03b5 , \u03c4 = 3):\nTheorem 25. If \u03b5 is sufficiently small, there exists a polyhomogeneous function \u03c8\u03b5 on M\u03b5 which\nhas a C 2 extension to M \u03b5 that is equal to 1 on \u2202M \u03b5 , and satisfies\n1\n1\n3\n(76)\n\u2206g\u03b5 \u03c8\u03b5 \u2212 R(g\u03b5 )\u03c8\u03b5 + |\u03bd\u03b5 |2g\u03b5 \u03c8\u03b5\u22127 \u2212 \u03c8\u03b55 = 0.\n8\n8\n4\nThe function \u03c8\u03b5 is a small perturbation of the constant function \u03c80 \u2261 1 in the sense that\n\u221a\nk\u03c8\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c80 k2,\u03b1 = O( \u03b5) as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nProof. By the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the sequence\n\n\u03b70,\u03b5 := 0, \u03b71,\u03b5 := G\u03b5 (\u03b70,\u03b5 ), . . . , \u03b7n,\u03b5 := G\u03b5 (\u03b7n\u22121,\u03b5 ), . . .\n\n\u221a\nconverges in B C \u221a\u03b5 \u2286 C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ). Thus, there exists a function \u03b7\u03b5 on M\u03b5 such that k\u03b7\u03b5 k2,\u03b1 \u2264 C \u03b5\nand such that the function \u03c8\u03b5 := \u03c80 +\u03b7\u03b5 solves the Lichnerowicz equation. To address the regularity\nof \u03c8\u03b5 , note that \u03b7n,\u03b5 \u2208 C12,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) for all n, \u03b5. Consequently, each \u03b7n,\u03b5 has a continuous extension\nto M \u03b5 that vanishes on \u2202M \u03b5 . Because convergence in C 2,\u03b1 (M\u03b5 ) implies uniform convergence, it\nfollows that, for each fixed \u03b5, the limit \u03b7\u03b5 := limn\u2192\u221e \u03b7n,\u03b5 also has a continuous extension to M \u03b5\nand vanishes on \u2202M \u03b5 . We now conclude that \u03c8\u03b5 = \u03c80 + \u03b7\u03b5 approaches 1 at the ideal boundary.\nTherefore, Corollary 7.4.2 of [1] applies and we see that \u03c8\u03b5 is polyhomogeneous. Inserting the\nasymptotic expansion for \u03c8\u03b5 into (76) and comparing like terms inductively, we find that the first\nlog terms in \u03c8\u03b5 appear with \u03c13\u03b5 . (These terms arise as a consequence of the indicial roots of the\n\u0003\nlinearized Lichnerowicz operator.) It follows that \u03c8\u03b5 has a C 2 extension to M \u03b5 .\nWith these solutions \u03c8\u03b5 to the Lichnerowicz equation in hand, we readily verify that the oneparameter family of initial data sets (M\u03b5 , \u03c8\u03b54 g\u03b5 , \u03c8\u03b5\u22122 \u03bd\u03b5 + \u03c8\u03b54 g\u03b5 ) satisfies the list of properties outlined\nin 2. Hence we have constructed the desired asymptotic gluing of AH initial data satisfying the\nEinstein constraint equations.\n8. Conclusions\nThe gluing construction which we have discussed and verified here allows one to take a pair\n(or more) of CMC initial data sets for isolated systems with unique asymptotic regions\u2013either\nasymptotically null data sets in asymptotically flat spacetimes, or data sets in asymptotically\ndeSitter spacetimes\u2013and glue them together in such a way that the spacetime which develops\nfrom this glued data has a single asymptotic region. In the case that the original data sets are\nasymptotically null, one may wonder how the Bondi mass [22] for the glued data compares with\nthe Bondi masses for the original data sets. We will study this issue in future work.\nThere are a number of ways in which the results proven here might be extended. It should be\nstraightforward to be able to handle solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell or Einstein-fluid constraints,\n\n\f36\n\nJAMES ISENBERG, JOHN M. LEE, IVA STAVROV ALLEN\n\nrather than the Einstein vacuum constraint equations. A more challenging generalization we plan\nto consider is to allow for initial data sets which do not have constant mean curvature. We have\ndone this in earlier gluing work [10] using localized deformations of the original data sets so that,\nin small neighborhoods of the gluing points, the mildly perturbed original initial data sets do have\nconstant mean curvature. The work of Bartnik [3] shows that this sort of deformation can always be\ndone. A key first step in generalizing our results here to non CMC initial data sets is to generalize\nBartnik's local CMC deformation results to neighborhoods of asymptotic points in AH initial data\nsets. This issue is under consideration.\nOne further generalization of some interest is to attempt to carry out localized gluing at asymptotic points in AH initial data sets. To do this, it would likely be necessary to determine if the\nwork of Chru\u015bciel and Delay [8] generalizes so that it holds in asymptotic neighborhoods in AH\ninitial data sets. While this may prove to be difficult, we do believe that we will be able to localize\nthe gluing to the extent that in regions bounded away from the ideal boundary, the glued data is\nunchanged from the original data.\nReferences\n[1] Andersson, L., Chru\u015bciel, P.
