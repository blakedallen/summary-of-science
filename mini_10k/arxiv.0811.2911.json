We find\nout that this possibility can be realized in the so-called focus-point region\nof parameter space. The mass degeneracy of higgsino-like chargino and two\nhiggsino-like neutralinos is the necessary condition for a long lifetime. It requires the fine-tuning of parameters, but being a single additional constraint\nin the whole parameter space it can be fulfilled in the Constrained MSSM\nalong the border line where radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails.\nIn a narrow band close to the border line the charginos are long-lived particles. The cross-sections of their production and co-production at the LHC via\nelectroweak interaction reach a few tenth of pb.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn expected discovery of SUSY at the LHC is based on the MSSM predictions\nwith a wide range of possibilities and uncertainties [1, 2, 3]. The usual pattern\nis that one has heavy short-lived particles which are created in strong and weak\ninteractions and then decay (almost immediately) into Standard Model particles.\nThese processes have a natural Standard Model background and their observation\nis rather sophisticated.\nThere are, however, some exotic cases, which are more natural within the gauge\nmediation scenario but may also be realized in mSUGRA when SUSY particles\nare long-lived. In the latter case, this usually takes place when their masses are\ndegenerate with the LSP mass and the decay rate therefore is suppressed. This\ndegeneracy in its turn requires precise fine-tuning of parameters of the mSUGRA\nparameter space. However, having at least four parameters (m0 , m1/2 , A0 and tan \u03b2)\none has enough freedom to satisfy this single additional requirement.\n1\n\n\fIn what follows we analyse the parameter space of the MSSM with gravity mediated SUSY breaking with the aim to find the regions where the above-mentioned\ndegeneracy can take place and hence the long-lived superpartners might exist. In\nour previous papers we considered two of such possibilities: long-lived staus which\nlive in the so-called coannihilation region [4, 5], and long-lived stops which live at\nthe edge of the bulk region near the Higgs limit border line [6, 7].\nHere we explore another region of parameter space which is a narrow band along\nthe line where the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails. On the border of\nthis region the Higgs mixing parameter \u03bc, which is determined from the requirement\nof electroweak symmetry breaking via radiative corrections, tends to zero. This leads\nto existence of light and degenerate states: the second chargino and two neutralinos,\nall of them being essentially higgsinos. Below we discuss their properties and possible\ncreation at the LHC.\n\n2\n\nConstraints on the MSSM Parameter Space for\nLarge Values of A\n\nIn what follows we consider the MSSM with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking and the universal soft terms. We thus have the parameter space defined by\nm0 , m1/2 , A, tan \u03b2 and we take the sign of \u03bc to be positive motivated by contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon [8, 9, 10]. Imposing the constraints\nlike: i) the gauge couplings unification [11, 12, 13], ii) neutrality of the LSP [14, 15],\niii) the Higgs boson and SUSY mass experimental limits [16, 17, 18], iv) radiative\nelectroweak symmetry breaking [19, 20], we get the allowed region of parameter\nspace of the CMSSM. Projected onto the m0 , m1/2 plane this region depends on the\nvalues of tan \u03b2 and A.\nWe are interested in chargino and neutralino masses. The mass terms are nondiagonal and look like\n1\n1\nLGaugino\u2212Higgsino = \u2212 M3 \u03bb\u0304a \u03bba \u2212 \u03c7\u0304M (0) \u03c7 \u2212 (\u03c8\u0304M (c) \u03c8 + h.c.),\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bba , a = 1, 2, . . . , 8, are the Majorana gluino fields and\n\n\u03c7=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nB\u0303 0\nW\u0303 3\nH\u030310\nH\u030320\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03c8=\n\nW\u0303 +\nH\u0303 +\n\n!\n\nare, respectively, the Majorana neutralino and Dirac chargino fields.\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fAt the tree level the neutralino mass matrix is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nM (0) = \uf8ec\n\nM1\n0\n\u2212MZ cos \u03b2 sinW MZ sin \u03b2 sinW\n0\nM2\nMZ cos \u03b2 cosW \u2212MZ sin \u03b2 cosW\n\u2212MZ cos \u03b2 sinW MZ cos \u03b2 cosW\n0\n\u2212\u03bc\nMZ sin \u03b2 sinW \u2212MZ sin \u03b2 cosW\n\u2212\u03bc\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(3)\nwhere tan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 is the ratio of two Higgs v.e.v.s and sinW = sin \u03b8W is the usual\nsinus of the weak mixing angle. The physical neutralino masses m\u03c7\u03030i are obtained\nas eigenvalues of this matrix after diagonalization.\nFor charginos one has\n!\n\u221a\nM\n2M\nsin\n\u03b2\n2\nW\nM (c) = \u221a\n.\n(4)\n2MW cos \u03b2\n\u03bc\nThis matrix has two chargino eigenstates \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1,2 with mass eigenvalues\n2\nM1,2\n=\n\n\u2213\n\n1h 2\n2\nM2 + \u03bc2 + 2MW\n2\n\n(5)\n\u0015\n\nq\n\n4\n2\n(M22 \u2212 \u03bc2 )2 + 4MW\ncos2 2\u03b2 + 4MW\n(M22 + \u03bc2 + 2M2 \u03bc sin 2\u03b2) .\n\nThese matrices obtain radiative corrections which are known in the leading order [21, 22]. Typically they are of the order of a few per cent.\nWhen \u03bc is small (less than MZ ), which takes place in the focus point region near\nthe border line of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, the lightest chargino\n0\n(\u03c7\u00b1\n1 ) and two lightest neutralinos (\u03c71,2 ) are almost degenerate and have a mass of\nthe order of \u03bc, which corresponds to the minus sign in Eq.5. All of them in this\ncase are predominantly higgsinos. In Fig.1 it is shown how the mass of the lightest\nneutralino and the mass of the lightest chargino depend on \u03bc.\nWe are interested in the region of small \u03bc where the three masses (m\u03c701 , m\u03c702 , m\u03c7\u00b11 )\nare almost degenerate. This takes place for any choice of the other parameters since\nthe tree level formulae weakly depend on them and the one-loop corrections are\nusually small. However, since the value of \u03bc is not arbitrary in this approach but\nis taken from the requirement of electroweak symmetry breaking, one has to find\nthe region of parameter space where it is small. In Fig.1 this region is just above\nthe chargino LEP limit in the left bottom corner of the plots. One can see that\nmasses are degenerate, and there the value of \u03bc is of the order of 150\u2013200 GeV\ndepending on the value of tan \u03b2. There is also a slight dependence on M2 (that is\non m1/2 ); however, this dependence only shows how far we may go along the lines\nhaving masses degenerate. It is clearly seen that the bigger M2 the larger values of\n\u03bc are allowed. The mass of \u03c702 is not shown, it almost coincides with the \u03c7\u00b1\n1 mass.\nOne has to check also that the other requirements on the values of the mSUGRA\nparameters are satisfied in this region. The well-known analysis of the CMSSM\nshows that small values of \u03bc are achieved in the so-called focus-point region along\n3\n\n\fTan\n\nb\n\n=10,\n\nm>0\n\nM = 600 [GeV]\n2\n\nA = -3500 [GeV]\n\n=50,\n\nm>0\n\nM = 600 [GeV]\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nc\n\n575\n\nM = 500 [GeV]\n2\n\n+\n\nc\n\n1\n\n+\n\n1\n\n,\n\n,\n\n2\n\n460\n\n~\nc1+\n\nM = 400 [GeV]\n2\n\n345\n\nm\n\nc\nm\n\nb\n\nTan\n\nA = -3500 [GeV]\n\nc\n\nM = 500 [GeV]\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n575\n\n690\n\n[GeV]\n\n[GeV]\n\n690\n\n460\n\nM = 400 [GeV]\n2\n\n345\n\nM = 600 [GeV]\n2\n\nM = 600 [GeV]\n2\n\nM = 500 [GeV]\n\nM = 500 [GeV]\n\n2\n\n2\n\n~\nc1o\n\nM = 400 [GeV]\n\n230\n\n2\n\n230\n\n~\nc1+ mass LEP limits\n\n115\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\nm [GeV]\n\n1200\n\n~\nc1+\n\nM = 400 [GeV]\n2\n\n~\nc1+ mass LEP limits\n\n115\n1500\n\n1800\n\n~\nc1o\n\n250\n\n500\n\n750\n\nm\n\n1000\n\n1250\n\n1500\n\n[GeV]\n\nFigure 1: The masses of the lightest chargino and neutralino as functions of \u03bc for\nthe rest of parameters fixed. The value of M2 is taken to be 600, 500 and 400 GeV,\nand tan \u03b2=10,50, respectively. Dark (red) lower band shows the experimental limit\non chargino mass\nthe border line of electroweak symmetry breaking [23, 24, 25]. In Fig.2 we show the\nprojection of SUSY parameter space onto the m0 , m1/2 plane for different values of\nA and tan \u03b2. To calculate it, we use the SuSpect v2.3.4 code [26]1 . The relic density\nwas calculated with the help of the MicrOmegas package [27, 28]. In the case of\nlight chargino and the second neutralino when they are almost degenerate with the\nlightest neutralino, when calculating the relic density one has to take into account\nnot only the annihilation of two neutralinos but also the coannihilation of charginos\nand neutralinos.\nOne can see that for small values of A0 the Dark matter line does not go along\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking border but deviates from it, thus not allowing\nthe small values of \u03bc. For large and negative A0 , on the contrary, these two lines\nalmost coincide, the bigger the value of tan \u03b2 the better.\nIt should be mentioned that the region near the border line is very sensitive\nto the Standard Model parameters; a minor shift in \u03b1s or mt and mb leads to a\nnoticeable change of the spectrum, as can be seen from comparison of different\ncodes at [29, 30, 31].\nNote that though the region of small \u03bc looks very fine-tuned and indeed is very\nsensitive to all input parameters, still in the whole four dimensional parameter space\n(assuming universality) it swaps a wide area and can be easily reached. The accuracy\nof fine-tuning defines the accuracy of degeneracy of the masses and, hence, the life\ntime of the NLSP which is the lighest chargino.\n\u22121\nWe have set the following input values at MW ; \u03b1em\n= 127.934, \u03b1s = 0.1172, mpole\n= 172.7\nt\nMS\npole\nGeV, mb (mb )\n= 4.25 GeV, m\u03c4 = 1.777 GeV.\n1\n\n4\n\n\f800\n\n[GeV]\n\n~\nc\n\n+\n\nmass LEP limits\n\n1\n\n0\n\n~\n\nc1+ NLSP\n\nc1+ NLSP\nh\n\nNLSP\n\n1200\n\n~\n\n600\n\nt~\n\n1500\n\n1/2\n\nNLSP\n\nm\n\n1/2\n\nt~\n\nm\n\n[GeV]\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n~\n\nc1+ mass LEP limits\n\nmass LEP limits\n\n400\n\nW\n\nh\n\n600\n\n2\n\nN\n\nh\n\n200\n\nb\n\nTan =10\n\nm\n\n0\n\nW\n\nmass LEP limits\n\nh\n\n2\n\nN\n\n300\n\nb\n\nTan =50\n\n>0\n\n800\n\n1600\n\n2400\n\nm\n\n3200\n\n1\n\nmass LEP limits\n\n1500\n\nt~\n\n2200\n\n+\n\nh\n\nt NLSP\n\n0\n\n3300\n\nNLSP\n\n1200\n\n1 NLSP\n\n300\n\n~\n\n2750\n\n[GeV]\n\nm\n\n1/2\n\n+\n\n[GeV]\n\n~\nc\n\nt NLSP\n\nm\n\n1650\n0\n\n1/2\n\n[GeV]\n\n~\n\n~\nc\n\n1100\n\nm\n\n500\n\n400\n\n550\n\n4000\n\n[GeV]\n\n0\n\n>0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nm\n\nA =0\n\nA =0\n\nW\n\n900\nh\n\n~\n\nc1+ mass LEP limits\n\n~\n\n2\n\nc1+ NLSP\n\nmass LEP limits\n\n600\n\n200\n\nb\n\n100\n\nTan =10\n\nm\n\nW\n\n~\n\n300\n\n>0\n\nt NLSP\n\nh\n\n0\n\nh\n\n2\n\nN\n\nmass LEP limits\n\nb\n\nTan =50\n\nA =-800\n0\n\nm\n\n>0\n\nA =-800\n0\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\nm\n\n[GeV]\n\n750\n\n+\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1800\n\nNLSP\n\n~\n\nc1+\n\nmass LEP limits\n\n2400\n\n0\n\n750\n\nt~\n\n1/2\n\n~\nc\n\nt NLSP\n\nh\n\n1200\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\n600\n\n4000\n\nNLSP\n\n~\n\n1/2\n\n[GeV]\n\nt~\n\n1000\n\n3000\n\n[GeV]\n\n0\n\n3000\n\n3600\n\n[GeV]\n\nNLSP\n\n600\n\nW\n\n~\n\nh\n\n2\n\nc1+ NLSP\nmass LEP limits\n\n450\n\n500\n\n~\n\nt NLSP\nh\n\n300\n\n250\n\nb\n\nTan =10\n\nm\n\nW\n\n>0\n\nh\n\n1350\n\n~\n\nb\n\nTan =50\n\n2700\n\n4050\n\nm\n\n0\n\n5400\n\n6750\n\n>0\n\n0\n\n1600\n\n[GeV]\n\nm\n\nA =-3500\n\n150\n\n0\n\n0\n\nmass LEP limits\n\nc1+ mass ~150 GeV\n\n2\n\nA =-3500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2400\n\n3200\nm\n\n0\n\n4000\n\n4800\n\n5600\n\n[GeV]\n\nFigure 2: Allowed region of the mSUGRA parameter space for A0 = 0, \u2212800, \u22123500\nGeV and tan \u03b2 = 10, 50, respectively.

Its mass is typically in the 100 GeV range and the cross-section of\nproduction at the LHC is considerably high. The main production diagrams are\nshown in Fig.3. Since three states are almost degenerate, one has also co-production\nwhich has to be taken into account. This refers also to the annihilation process that\ndefines the amount of the Dark matter.\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\nFigure 3: Main chargino production diagrams at the LHC\nTo calculate the production rate, one has to know the spectrum of the light states\nand the mixings in the chargino-neutralino sector. In our case, the lightest chargino\nand the lightest neutralinos are almost fully higgsinos. This property defines the\npreferences in the interaction pattern. To be specific, we choose several points in\nthe mSUGRA parameter space which are situated in the focus point region along\nthe border of electroweak symmetry breaking (see Fig.2). The values of \u03bc and tan \u03b2\nare varied. As we have already mentioned for consistency with the relic density\nconstraint the advocated scenario prefers large negative A0 and large tan \u03b2.\nFor each point we have calculated the cross-sections of chargino production and\nco-production with the lightest and next-to-lightest neutralino. The main reactions\nare\ne\u2212\ne01 , pp \u2192 \u03c7\ne+\ne 02\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1,\n1\u03c7\n1\u03c7\n\nThe tree level processes are shown in Fig.3. The cross-sections are calculated\nwith the help of the CALCHEP code [34] with the MRST parton distribution [35]\nand are summarized in Tables 1-3. Shown also are the partial cross-sections for\nparticular quarks inside the proton.\nOne can see that on average the cross-sections reach a few tenth of pb and\nslightly vary with the change of tan \u03b2. The cross-sections mainly depend on \u03bc: the\nbigger the value of \u03bc the smaller the cross-section. This is due to the fact that the\ncross-section mostly depends on the masses determined mostly by \u03bc and mixings.\nThe values of parameters used in our calculations are the following: we take\nM1 = 200 GeV, and all squark and slepton masses are around 1000 GeV. The\nvalues of \u03bc are 120, 150 and 200 GeV, and tan \u03b2 values are 10, 30, 50.\n6\n\n\fProcess\ne\u2212\nuu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n\u2212\ne\nuu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n\u03c7\n1 1\ne\u2212\ndd \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n+ \u2212\ndd \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e1\n\u03c3p1 (pb)\ne01\nud \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n+ 0\ndu \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e1\n\u03c3p2 (pb)\ne02\nud \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\ne02\ndu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n\u03c3p3 (pb)\n\ntan \u03b2 = 10 tan \u03b2 = 30 tan \u03b2 = 50\ne\u2212\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n0.46\n0.45\n0.45\n0.46\n0.45\n0.45\n0.20\n0.19\n0.19\n0.20\n0.19\n0.19\n1.32\n1.28\n1.28\n+ 0\npp \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e1\n0.82\n0.79\n0.78\n0.82\n0.79\n0.78\n1.63\n1.58\n1.56\n+ 0\npp \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e2\n0.67\n0.66\n0.66\n0.67\n0.66\n0.66\n1.34\n1.32\n1.32\n\nTable 1: The cross-sections for the chargino production and co-production at the\nLHC in the focus point region for \u03bc = 120 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 10, 30, 50\n\nProcess\ne\u2212\nuu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n+ \u2212\nuu \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e1\ne\u2212\ndd \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\ne\u2212\ndd \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n\u03c3p1 (pb)\ne01\nud \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n+ 0\ndu \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e1\n\u03c3p2 (pb)\ne02\nud \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n+ 0\ndu \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e2\n\u03c3p3 (pb)\n\ntan \u03b2 = 10 tan \u03b2 = 30 tan \u03b2 = 50\ne\u2212\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n0.22\n0.22\n0.21\n0.22\n0.22\n0.21\n0.09\n0.09\n0.09\n0.09\n0.09\n0.09\n0.62\n0.61\n0.60\n0\ne\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\n\u03c7\n1 1\n0.35\n0.35\n0.34\n0.35\n0.35\n0.34\n0.70\n0.69\n0.68\n+ 0\npp \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e2\n0.32\n0.31\n0.31\n0.32\n0.31\n0.31\n0.64\n0.63\n0.62\n\nTable 2: The cross-sections for the chargino production and co-production at the\nLHC in the focus point region for \u03bc = 150 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 10, 30, 50\n\n7\n\n\fProcess\n\ntan \u03b2 = 10 tan \u03b2 = 30 tan \u03b2 = 50\ne\u2212\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n0.09\n0.08\n0.08\n0.09\n0.08\n0.08\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.23\n0.22\n0.22\n+ 0\ne\ne\npp \u2192 \u03c71 \u03c71\n0.10\n0.09\n0.09\n0.10\n0.09\n0.09\n0.20\n0.19\n0.19\n0\ne\npp \u2192 \u03c7e+\n\u03c7\n1 2\n0.13\n0.12\n0.12\n0.12\n0.12\n0.12\n0.25\n0.24\n0.24\n\ne\u2212\nuu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n\u2212\ne\nuu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n\u03c7\n1 1\n+ \u2212\ndd \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e1\ne\u2212\ndd \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n1\n\u03c3p1 (pb)\ne01\nud \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\ne01\ndu \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n\u03c3p2 (pb)\ne02\nud \u2192 \u03c7e+\n1\u03c7\n+ 0\ndu \u2192 \u03c7e1 \u03c7e2\n\u03c3p3 (pb)\n\n[Sec]\n\n[Sec]\n\nTable 3: The cross-sections for the chargino production and co-production at the\nLHC in the focus point region for \u03bc = 200 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 10, 30, 50\n\nA=-3500 [GeV]\n\n1E-11\n\n\u03b2\n\u03bc>0\n\nTan( )=10\n1E-12\n\n1E-11\n\nA=-3500 [GeV]\n\n\u03b2\n\u03bc>0\n\nTan( )=50\n1E-12\n\n1E-13\n1E-13\n\n1E-14\n\n1E-14\n\n1E-15\n\n1E-15\n\n1E-16\n\n1E-16\n\n1E-17\n\n1E-17\n\n1E-18\n\n1E-18\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n( m\n\n\u03c71+\n\n12\n\n- m\n\n\u03c71\n\no\n\n16\n\n0\n\n20\n\n4\n\n8\n\n( m\n\n) [GeV]\n\n\u03c71+\n\n12\n\n- m\n\n\u03c71\n\no\n\n16\n\n20\n\n) [GeV]\n\nFigure 4: The lightest chargino lifetimes as a function of the mass difference between\nthe lightest chargino (NLSP) and the lightest neutralino (LSP).\n\n8\n\n\fIn Fig. 4 we show the lifetime of the lightest chargino as a function of the mass\ndifference between the lightest chargino (NLSP) and the lightest neutralino (LSP). It\nappears that in order to get reasonable \"large\" lifetimes one has to go very far along\nthe focus point region. Then keeping \u03bc small one can get lifetimes of the order of\n10\u221210 s for practically degenerate LSP and NLSP. When the mass difference increases\nthe lifetime falls down. However, if the degeneracy is within a few GeV, charginos\nare long-lived.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nExperimentally, of course, the possibility to have a charged heavy long-lived particle\nis appealing. As well as in the case of long-lived stau and stop, which we considered\nin our previous papers [4, 5, 6, 7], we may conclude that within the framework of\nthe MSSM with the soft supersymmetry breaking mechanism it is possible to get\nlong-lived superpartners of the Higgs (or W -boson) which might be produced at\nthe Large Hadronic Collider. The production cross-sections again crucially depend\non a single parameter - the mass of the superparticle and for light charginos it can\nreach a few pb. As in the case of light stops, the light chargino NLSP scenario\nrequires large negative values of the soft trilinear SUSY breaking parameter A0 , and\nlarge values of m0 and m1/2 . The chargino decay would have an unusual signature\nand produce a noticable signal rather than pure missing energy taken away by the\nlightest neutralino. The two options are: charginos go through the detector, or they\nproduce a secondary vertex when they decay inside the detector.\n\nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support from RFBR grant # 08-02-00856-a and grant of the Ministry of\nEducation and Science of the Russian Federation # 1027.2008.2 is acknowledged.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.P.
