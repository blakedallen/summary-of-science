R. Pennington\n\n1. QCD in the continuum\nQCD is a remarkable theory. At short distances, thanks to asymptotic freedom, quarks move\nas though they are free. There probed in hard scattering processes we can use perturbation theory,\nmake predictions and find that these agree with experiment. However, at longer distances, distance\nscales of the size of a hadron, the interaction becomes strong. This is the region that controls\nconfinement, the dynamical generation of mass and the binding of quarks to make hadrons [1, 2].\nTo illustrate the methods and how they work, let us consider the problem of mass generation [3,\n1]. We know that at short distances, the up and down quarks not only behave as though they barely\ninteract, but are almost massless too. What we have learnt is that over longer distances strong\ndynamics creates correlations in the vacuum that generates a mass of 300 MeV, dressing the quarks\nto become \"constituent\" quarks. We, of course, know that such dynamical generation of mass\nmust be a strong physics phenomenon, because in perturbation theory if a bare mass is zero, then\nthe mass is zero to all orders in the coupling. Moreover, since zero mass particles will not fit\non a finite size lattice, we know we have to study how masses are generated in the continuum.\nTo understand when this can happen, we consider the Schwinger-Dyson Equation (SDE) for the\nfermion propagator in a gauge theory.\nThe SDEs are the field equations of the theory, Fig. 1. The fermion propagator, SF (p), in\nmomentum space depends on two functions, its wavefunction renormalization F(p) and its mass\nfunction, M(p):\nF(p)\n.\n(1.1)\nSF (p) =\n6 p \u2212 M(p)\nSolving the SDE for the fermion, Fig. 1, requires knowledge of the boson propagator and the full\nfermion-boson interaction. In QED, where the equations are simpler to draw as in Fig. 1, the photon\npropagator depends on the very same full fermion propagator and fermion-boson vertex. So one\ncan imagine solving the coupled equations for the two propagators (or 2-point functions), provided\nwe know the 3-point vertex. But this in turn satisfies an SDE, again shown in Fig. 1, that relates\nthe 3-point function to the 2, 3 and 4-point functions, and the 4-point function is related to the\n2, 3, 4 and 5-point functions, and so on ad infinitum. Consequently, we have an infinite tower of\ncoupled equations that we cannot solve without some truncation. The best known approximation\nis to expand each Green's function in powers of the coupling. This gives us perturbation theory,\nwhich satisfies gauge invariance and multiplicative renormalizability at each order of truncation.\nWhile both the fermion and boson equations each involve two functions (as in Eq. 1.1), the 3-point\nequation contains 12 equations, and the tower becomes increasingly complex.\nTo see how to proceed, let us start by butchering the fermion equation. We can cut this off\nfrom the \"tower\" by treating the photon propagator and the vertex as bare, leaving just the fermion\npropagator as dressed. We can then perform the angular integrals and project out the functions F\nand M to obtain [1] in any covariant gauge \u03be :\n#\n\"Z 2\nZ \u03ba2\n2 F(k) M(k)\np\nM(p)\n\u03b10\n2 F(k) M(k)\n2 k\n= m0 +\n+\ndk 2\n, (1.2)\n(3 + \u03be )\ndk 2 2\nF(p)\n4\u03c0\np k + M(k)2\nk + M(k)2\np2\n0\n#\n\"Z 2\nZ \u03ba2\n4\np\nF(k)\nF(k)\n\u03b10 \u03be\n1\n2\n2 k\n=1+\n+\ndk 2\n.\n(1.3)\ndk 4 2\nF(p)\n4\u03c0\np k + M(k)2\nk + M(k)2\np2\n0\n2\n\n\fStrong Coupling QCD\n\nM. R. Pennington\n\nFigure 1: Schwinger-Dyson equations in QED for the fermion and boson propagators and their interaction.\nThe solid dots denote full Green's functions.\n\nOf course, this is not a calculation of a realistic situation. The photon being bare, the coupling, \u03b10 ,\ndoes not run and there is no intrinsic scale. Consequently, in Eqs. (1.2, 1.3) we have introduced a\ncutoff \u03ba on the integrals. This sets the scale prior to renomalization. Looking at these equations we\nsee that, if we work in the Landau gauge with \u03be = 0, Eq. (1.3) simplifies further with F = 1. This\nleaves the mass equation, Eq. (1.2), which always has the solution M = 0 if the bare mass m0 = 0.\nBut when can a non-zero mass function be generated? If the coupling is big enough, a mass function\nthat looks qualitatively similar to those in QCD, shown in Fig. 2, can indeed be found: non-zero\nin the infrared and then dying away at larger momenta. Such solutions only happen if the fixed\ncoupling \u03b10 \u2265 \u03c0 /3. Thus, if the interaction is strong enough, a mass can be generated. However, if\nwe now solve Eqs. (1.2, 1.3) in other covariant gauges, we see the same qualitative behaviour, but\nthis happens at different values of the coupling. This tells us our approximation, in particular the\nuse of a bare interaction, does not respect gauge invariance. Of course, the Ward-Green-Takahashi\nidentity (WGTI) [4], which relates a projection of the fully dressed 3-point function to the inverse\nof the fermion propagator, is a key consequence of gauge invariance that the bare vertex does not\nsatisfy, except in massless, quenched QED. What we have learnt from two decades of study [1]\nis that imposing the WGTI together with the requirement of multiplicative renormalizability pulls\nthrough from the tower of SDEs just what is required to obtain physically meaningful results.\nThis is the technology that we take to the study of QCD, together with the expectation that\ndynamical mass generation will occur when the coupling is strong.\n3\n\n\fStrong Coupling QCD\n\nM. R. Pennington\n\n2. First studies in strong coupling QCD\nThe field equations of QCD are of course more complicated than QED, involving not only\nthe self-interaction of gluons, but in covariant gauges also ghosts. An important Slavnov-Taylor\nidentity [5] is that relating the 3-gluon interaction to the inverse propagator of the gluon. In axial\ngauges this is particularly simple, and was the starting point for the analysis of Baker, Ball and\nZachariasen (BBZ) [6]. Though in axial gauges there are no ghosts, the gluon propagator depends\non two independent functions. BBZ made an approximation that only one of these is relevant,\nbut this was shown by West [7] to be inconsistent in the infrared region. Consequently, attention\nturned to covariant gauges, in particular the Landau gauge, where the gluon propagator depends\non just one function \u2206(q2 ). The corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity for the dressed 3-gluon\ninteraction now involves ghost functions. The first studies 25-30 years ago set these to one, and\nassumed that the role of ghosts was merely to ensure the physical gluons were transverse, but\notherwise their effect was negligible/neglectable. Only gluon dressing was deemed required for\nconfinement dynamics. These studies started independently with Pagels [8], Mandelstam [9] and\nBar-Gadda [10], and indicated that the gluon propagator became singular in the infrared. The first\nmajor numerical study was performed by Nick Brown and myself [11] more than twenty years\nago, which showed how the gluon enhancement was correlated with \u039bQCD , and that the addition\nof generations of massless quarks softened this enhancement. The strong coupling was enhanced\nin the infrared, but merged with standard perturbation theory above a few GeV. Such behaviour\ngenerates dynamical masses for the up and down quarks, as shown by Maris and Roberts [12]. In\nFig. 2 is plotted the behaviour of the quark mass function for a range of current masses [13] from 3\nto 100 MeV. In each case the \"current\" quarks are dressed by roughly 300 MeV of mass at infrared\nmomenta to emerge as \"constituent\" quarks, the scale being set by \u039bQCD .

These results from Ref. [13] are\nessentially the same as those obtained earlier by Maris and Roberts [12] covering a bigger range of masses\nrequired for 5 flavours, relevant to the discussion in Sect. 3.\n\n4\n\n\fStrong Coupling QCD\n\nM. R. Pennington\n\nin the continuum, we can take the current mass to zero and so determine the chiral limit. Then\nmatching the behaviour in Fig. 2 to the Operator Product Expansion at large momenta, we learn\nthis corresponds to a non-zero chiral condensate with h qq i0 = \u2212(240 MeV)3 [12], in agreement\nwith experiments on low energy \u03c0\u03c0 scattering [14, 15].\nFor later, we note that the results for the quark mass functions M(p) of Fig. 2 and their extension to GeV current masses [12], can be parametrised by\nM(p) \u2243 M0 + c\n\n\u039b3QCD\np2 + \u039b2QCD\n\n,\n\n(2.1)\n\nif we simply ignore the anomalous dimensions. M0 is the current mass, c a dimensionless constant\nfixed from Fig. 2, and where \u039bQCD sets the scale for the infrared dressing and the qq condensate.\nHow is an infrared enhanced gluon related to confinement? The interaction between quarks\nand antiquarks is given by an infinite set of gluon exchange graphs. However, if we consider the\ninfinite quark mass limit, then all those with internal quark propagators are suppressed and the\nquark-gluon vertex becomes bare. This is the basis of \"Heavy Quark Effective Theory\". Then the\ninterquark potential is generated by one gluon exchange, and the static potential V (r) in position\nspace is just the Fourier transform of the time-time component of the dressed gluon propagator,\n\u2206(q). This generates a wholly vector potential and so must be modified for physical, finite mass\nquark effects. For heavy quarks, it is just a matter of dimensional analysis to see that the behaviours\nV (r) \u223c ra\n\nand\n\n\u2206(q) \u223c q\u22123\u2212a\n\n(2.2)\n\nare correlated when q r \u223c 1. This naturally accords with expectation at large momenta when the\ngluon is essentially free, behaving like 1/q2 , i.e. a = \u22121. This corresponds to a Coulomb-like\npotential at short distances. If at larger distances the potential is to grow linearly with r, then this\nstatic approximation requires \u2206(q) \u223c 1/q4 for q \u226a 1. Neglecting ghosts this is just what happens.\n\n3. T\u00fcbingen/Graz/Darmstadt studies of QCD\nThe next group to pursue intensive studies started in T\u00fcbingen, but is now dispersed all over the\nglobe, with von Smekal, Alkofer, Fischer and collaborators [16, 17]. They showed that ghosts do\nplay an important role. It is ghosts that become enhanced in the infrared, while the gluon propagator\nwith its physical transverse polarisations is suppressed. In this \"scaling\" solution, the behaviour of\nthe ghost and gluon are correlated, Fig. 3, so that the effective coupling becomes enhanced with\na finite value in the infrared. A major effort has been undertaken to check the consistency of the\ntower of SDEs in the deep infrared, e.g. [18]. While mathematically well defined these studies\nprobe the behaviour of the Green's functions when the hadron universe is more than 10 fermis\nlarge, Fig. 3. However, the physics of hadrons only depends on QCD dynamics from 0.1 to at\nmost 2 fermis. There the enhancement of the coupling is expected to lead to dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking, as in the studies where ghosts were neglected. This has been shown explicitly\nin Ref. [19]. Key to these studies is the non-trivial structure of the quark-gluon interaction with\na crucial scalar component generated by the contribution of the ghost loop in Fig. 4. In the limit\nin which the two fermion momenta, p, p\u2032 , are small, one would expect the contribution of such a\ngraph to depend on the quark mass as sketched in Eq. (3.1):\n5\n\n\fStrong Coupling QCD\n\nM. R. Pennington\n\nFigure 3: Log-log plots of (a) the gluon and ghost renormalization functions, and (b) the quark mass functions from the studies in Refs. [17, 19].\n\nFigure 4: The ghost triangle claimed in Ref. [19] to enhance the quark-gluon vertex even in the heavy quark\nlimit.\n\nIf the quark mass function behaves for heavy quarks as illustrated in Fig. 2 and given by Eq. (2.1),\nthen the corrections, Fig. 4, to the bare vertex would be like those in Eq. (3.2), and so be suppressed\nin the infinite quark mass limit. However, Alkofer et al. [19] find their quark mass functions have\na rather different behaviour - as shown on the right in Fig. 3. While the quarks all gain 300 MeV\nof mass above their current value in the phenomenologically important region of momenta of 0.1\nto 1 GeV, the heavy quark masses decrease in the deeper infrared. This behaviour circumvents\nthe underpinning assumptions of the heavy quark limit discussed above. Remarkably, Alkofer et\nal. [19] then find that a potential growing linearly with distance emerges. I personally find the low\nmomentum behaviour of the \"heavy\" quark mass function of Fig. 3 rather bizarre, and demands\nfurther investigation. However, we do see that in the region probed by hadron physics that this\nmodelling is just as likely as that with the enhanced gluon. This will be confirmed by calculation\nof hadron masses.\nAs yet another alternative, Mandula and Ogilvie [20] long ago proposed a solution for the\ngluon with an effective mass, and this has been more recently studied by Aguilar et al. [21]. Such\nbehaviour appears to be correlated with a finite infrared enhancement of the ghost, as found by\nBoucaud et al. [22] in particular. Interestingly, this type of solution appears to be in qualitative\nagreement with recent lattice results, for instance those of Ref. [23]. However, these SDE solutions\nhave been dismissed by the proponents of the \"scaling\" solution [16]-[19] in Ref. [24].\n6\n\n\fStrong Coupling QCD\n\nM. R. Pennington\n\nAn aim of this whole approach is to build hadrons and to be able to do this for physical mass\nquarks [25, 2]. Something lattice computations are just being able to study. Knowing the quark\nand gluon propagators and their interactions allows us to solve the Bound State (or Bethe-Salpeter)\nequations (BSE). We start with qq systems. The key dynamics is provided by the quark scattering\nkernel and most studies use the rainbow ladder approximation [25]. For states with pseudoscalar\nquantum numbers satisfying the axial Ward identity is crucial [26, 27]. This ensures that in the\nlimit of zero mass quarks, the pion is massless with chiral symmetry dynamically broken. Moreover, pion-pion interactions have much of the essence of Chiral Perturbation Theory: not all, as the\nkernels do not yet include a complete pseudoscalar nonet, but this approach is getting there. The\nmasses of scalars are found to be sensitive to the details of the scattering kernel. Consequently,\nthe shape of scalar-pseudoscalar potential cannot yet be mapped out with any confidence. However, vector bound states are more robust. The \u03c1 and \u03c0 masses can be evaluated for a whole range\nof quark masses with interactions modelled to reproduce the enhanced gluon scenario or the suppressed gluon one [25, 28, 29], and both match the lattice results of CP-PACS [30]. This highlights\nhow the SDE/BSE approach can continue lattice results with their unphysical current quark masses\nto those of the real world rather well, and that the SDE/BSE system encodes the key strong coupling dynamics that extends QCD perturbation theory into the confinement regime - and that this\ndoes not depend critically on knowledge of the deep infrared.\nOne can of course use this same approach to study other dynamical quantities. Electromagnetic\nform-factors are naturally first [31], where a simple impulse approximation may be justifiable. The\nspacelike pion form-factor is the benchmark for the extensions of perturbation theory pioneered by\nBrodsky and Lepage [32]. Studies in the SDE/BSE approach reproduce experiment and show the\nperturbative limit is not reached before Q2 \u2243 50 GeV2 . More recently attention has turned to the\nproperties of baryons [31], an even more challenging problem requiring a full Fadeev treatment.\nHowever, we can proceed more simply, and perhaps more profitably, by noting that having forms\nfor the quark and gluon Green's functions allows us to study not just the BSE for quarks and\nantiquarks, but also for diquarks. Baryons are then built of diquark-quark systems, and measuring\ntheir electromagnetic transition form-factors with precision at JLab will probe the strong coupling\nregime and the predictions of the SDE/BSE treatment of QCD [33]. Such an interplay between\ntheory and experiment promises instructive insight into how confinement in QCD really works.\nThe author acknowledges partial support of the EU-RTN Programme, Contract No. MRTN\u2013\nCT-2006-035482, \"Flavianet\" for this work.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
