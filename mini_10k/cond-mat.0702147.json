Introduction\nRecently a great attention has been paid on the research of a new type of artificial\nmaterials: medium with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability which\nis introduced by Veselago in his early paper in 1968 [1] and named as left-handed\nmetamaterial (LHM). The electric field, magnetic field and wave vector of an\nelectromagnetic plane wave in such materials form a left-handed system of vectors.\nThe LHMs introduce peculiar yet interesting properties such as negative refraction,\nreversed Doppler effect and reversed Cerenkov radiation etc. One of the most important\napplications of LHMs suggested by Sir John Pendry, is the \"perfect lens\" [2], e.g.\nthe subwavelength imaging which allows the information below the diffraction limit\nof conventional imaging systems to be transported. The LHM lenses provide unique\nproperties of negative refraction and amplification of evanescent waves, which accounts\nfor the reconstruction of source information at the image plane.\nThe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [3] is a versatile and robust\ntechnique. Over the years it has been widely used for the modelling of electromagnetic\nwave interaction with various frequency dispersive and non-dispersive materials. For\nmodelling of LHMs with negative material properties, the frequency dispersion has\nto be taken into account therefore the dispersive FDTD method needs to be used.\nThe existing frequency dispersive FDTD methods can be categorised into three types:\nthe recursive convolution (RC) method [4], the auxiliary differential equation (ADE)\nmethod [5] and the Z-transform method [6]. The RC scheme relates electric flux density\nto electric field intensity through a convolution integral, which can be discretised as a\nrunning sum. The dispersive FDTD method applying the RC scheme has been used\nfor modelling of different types of dispersive materials in [7\u201314]. The ADE method\nintroduces additional differential equations in order to describe frequency dependent\nmaterial properties [15\u201320]. Another dispersive FDTD method is based on the Ztransforms [21, 22]: the time-domain convolution integral is reduced to a multiplication\nusing the Z-transform, and a recursive relation between electric flux density and electric\nfield is derived.\nThere have been a number of attempts to model LHMs using the FDTD method\n[23\u201328]. It may seem that the conventional dispersive FDTD has been verified in the\nliterature: the negative refraction effect which is inherent to the boundary between the\nfree space and LHM is observed and the planar superlens behaviour has been successfully\ndemonstrated [23\u201325]. Actually, this means that the LHM is correctly modelled only for\nthe case of propagating waves. When evanescent waves are considered the conventional\nimplementation of dispersive FDTD method may lead to inaccurate results. Usually, the\nevanescent waves decay exponentially over distances and thus they are concentrated in\nthe close vicinity of sources, that is why conventional FDTD modelling of non-dispersive\nmaterials does not suffer from the aforementioned numerical inaccuracy. In the case of\nLHM, the evanescent waves play a key role and have to be modelled accurately because\nof the perfect lens effect [2]. This explains why early FDTD simulations have not\n\n\f3\ndemonstrated the subwavelength imaging property of LHM lenses [23, 24]. A slab of\nLHM effectively amplifies evanescent waves which normally decay in usual materials\nand allows transmission of subwavelength details of sources to significant distances.\nOther numerical studies using the FDTD method include the effect of losses and\nthicknesses on the transmission characteristics of LHM slabs [27], and the influence\nof numerical material parameters on their imaging properties [28] etc. Besides the\nFDTD method, the pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) method has been used for the\nmodelling of backward-wave metamaterials [29]. It is claimed in [29] that the FDTD\nmethod cannot be used to accurately model LHMs due to the numerical artefact of\nthe staggered grid in FDTD domain. However, we shall show later by comparing the\ntransmission coefficient calculated from FDTD simulation and exact analytical solutions\nthat with proper field averaging techniques [28, 30], the FDTD method indeed can be\nused to accurately characterise the behavior of both propagating and evanescent waves\nin LHM slabs. Furthermore, it has been reported in [31, 32] that with special treatment\n(i.e. averaging techniques) along material boundaries, accurate modelling of curved\nsurfaces of conventional dielectrics as well as surface plasmon polaritons between metaldielectric interfaces can be achieved without using extremely fine FDTD meshes.\nIdeally lossless LHM slabs with infinite transverse length provide unlimited\nsubwavelength resolution. However in realistic situations, the subwavelength resolution\nof the LHM lenses is limited by losses [33], the thickness of the slab and the mismatch\nof the slab with its surrounding medium [34]. It is important to understand these\ntheoretical limitations because they can help verify numerical simulations. In this\npaper, we have performed the modelling of infinite LHM slabs and their transmission\ncharacteristics. The infinite LHM slab is modelled using the periodic boundary condition\nand a material parameter averaging technique is used along the boundaries of LHM slabs.\nIn contrast to FDTD modelling of conventional dielectric slabs where the averaging is\nonly a second-order correction to improve the accuracy of simulations, the averaging of\npermittivity is an essential modification for modelling of LHM slabs. The averaging\nof material parameters implemented in our FDTD simulations is equivalent to the\naveraging of current density originally introduced in [28] and is analysed in detail in\nthis paper. It is demonstrated that other numerical aspects such as numerical material\nparameters and the switching time of source also have considerable influences on FDTD\nsimulations.\n2. Dispersive FDTD Modelling of LHMs with Spatial Averaging at the\nBoundaries\nWe consider here lossy isotropic LHM slabs modelled using the effective medium method.\nThe Drude model is used for both the permittivity \u03b5(\u03c9) and permeability \u03bc(\u03c9) with\nidentical dispersion forms:\n\u03b5(\u03c9) = \u03b50\n\n2\n\u03c9pe\n,\n1\u2212 2\n\u03c9 \u2212 j\u03c9\u03b3e\n\n!\n\n(1)\n\n\f4\n2\n\u03c9pm\n,\n1\u2212 2\n\u03c9 \u2212 j\u03c9\u03b3m\n\n!\n\n\u03bc(\u03c9) = \u03bc0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9pe and \u03c9pm are electric and magnetic plasma frequencies and \u03b3e and \u03b3m are\nelectric and magnetic collision frequencies, respectively.\nAlthough there are various dispersive FDTD methods available for the modelling\nof LHMs, due to its simplicity and efficiency, we have implemented the ADE method\nin this paper. There are also different schemes involving different auxiliary differential\nequations in addition to conventional FDTD updating equations. In this paper, two\nschemes, namely the (E, J, H, M) scheme [3] and the (E, D, H, B) scheme [5], are\nused and introduced respectively.\n2.1. The (E, D, H, B) Scheme\nThe (E, D, H, B) scheme is based on Faraday's and Ampere's Laws:\n\u2202B\ncurl(E) = \u2212\n,\n(3)\n\u2202t\n\u2202D\n,\n(4)\ncurl(H) =\n\u2202t\nas well as the constitutive relations D = \u03b5E and B = \u03bcH where \u03b5 and \u03bc are expressed\nby (1) and (2), respectively. Equations (3) and (4) can be discretised following a normal\nprocedure [3] which leads to conventional FDTD updating equations:\n1\n\nBn+1 = Bn \u2212 \u2206t * curl(En+ 2 ),\n\nD\n\nn+1\n\nn\n\n= D + \u2206t * curl(H\n\nn+ 21\n\n(5)\n\n).\n\n(6)\n\nwhere curl is discrete curl operator, \u2206t is FDTD time step and n is the number of time\nsteps.\nIn addition, auxiliary differential equations have to be taken into account and they\ncan be discretised through the following steps. The constitutive relation between D and\nE reads\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n2\nE.\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 j\u03c9\u03b3e D = \u03b50 \u03c9 2 \u2212 j\u03c9\u03b3e \u2212 \u03c9pe\n\n(7)\n\nUsing inverse Fourier transform and the following rules:\n\u22022\n\u2202\nj\u03c9 \u2192 , \u03c9 2 \u2192 \u2212 2 ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nEquation (7) can be rewritten in the time domain as\n\n(8)\n\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u22022\n2\n+\n\u03b3\nD\n=\n\u03b5\n+\n\u03b3e + \u03c9pe\nE.\ne\n0\n\u2202t2 \u2202t\n\u2202t2 \u2202t\n!\n\n!\n\n(9)\n\nThe FDTD simulation domain is represented by an equally spaced threedimensional (3-D) grid with periods \u2206x, \u2206y and \u2206z along x-, y- and z-directions,\nrespectively.

The Spatial Averaging Methods\nIn addition to the above introduced ADE schemes, due to the staggered grid in\nFDTD domain, a modification at the interfaces between different materials is often\nused to improve the accuracy of FDTD simulations. It has been shown that\nthe field averaging techniques based on the averaging of material parameters (e.g.\npermittivity and permeability) provide a second-order accuracy [36]. The averaged\npermittivity/permeability can be obtained by performing either arithmetic mean,\nharmonic mean or geometrical mean [36] and the arithmetic mean has been proven to\n\n\f7\nLHM\n\nx\nmx + 1\n\nEx\n\nmx\n\nHz\n\nEy\n\nmx - 1\n\ny\nmy - 1\n\nmy\n\nmy + 1\n\nFigure 1. The layout of FDTD grid illustrating the arrangement of material\nboundaries along y-direction. The gray arrows indicate where the averaged permittivity\nis used. The FDTD unit cell is shown on the right side.\n\nhave the best performance amount these three schemes. Previous analysis of averaging\ntechniques are performed for conventional dielectrics with positive permittivity and\npermeability. For the materials with negative permittivity/permeability, one of the\nsimplest ways to implement averaging is to use arithmetic mean. Furthermore, averaging\nshould be applied only for the field components tangential to material interfaces.\nTherefore depending on the configuration of FDTD simulation domain e.g. twodimensional (2-D) TE, 2-D TM or three-dimensional (3-D) cases, the averaging needs to\nbe performed in different ways. In this paper we have considered a 2-D (x-y) simulation\ndomain with H-polarisation where H is directed only along z-direction. Therefore only\nthree field components are non-zero: Ex , Ey and Hz . For the interfaces between LHM\nslab and the free space along x-direction, the averaged permittivity for the tangential\nelectric field component Ex is given by\n2\n\u03c9pe\n\u03b50 + \u03b5x\n,\n= \u03b50 1 \u2212\n< \u03b5x >=\n2\n2 (\u03c9 2 \u2212 j\u03c9\u03b3e )\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\n\u2032\nwhich is equivalent to replacing the plasma frequency \u03c9pe by \u03c9pe\n= \u03c9pe / 2 in (1).\nTherefore along the boundaries, the updating equation for Ex reads\nExn+1\n\n(\"\n\n#\n\n2\n\u03b3e\n1\nDxn+1 \u2212\n+\nDn\n=\n2\n\u03b50 (\u2206t)\n2\u03b50 \u2206t\n\u03b50 (\u2206t)2 x\n\"\n#\n\"\n#\n2\n2\n\u03c9pe\n\u03c9pe\n2\n1\n\u03b3e\nn\n+\nEx \u2212\nExn\u22121\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n2\n2\n(\u2206t)\n4\n(\u2206t)\n2\u2206t\n8\n#\n), \"\n#\n\"\n2\n\u03c9pe\n\u03b3e\n1\n\u03b3e\n1\nn\u22121\nDx\n.\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\u03b50 (\u2206t)2 2\u03b50 \u2206t\n(\u2206t)2 2\u2206t\n8\n\n(24)\n\nThe locations where the updating equation (24) is used is illustrated in Fig. 1 by gray\narrows.\nThe averaging of permittivity can be implemented for the (E, D, H, B) scheme.\nWhile for the (E, J, H, M) scheme, it is proposed in [28] to use the averaging of\n\n\f8\ntangential current density along the boundaries of LHM slab.

In order to demonstrate the advantage of averaging\ntechnique, we have also compared the results from simulations with and without\naveraged permittivity along material boundaries. For the case of without averaging,\nthe tangential electric fields indicated by gray arrows in Fig. 1 are updated using their\nupdating equations in the free space.\nThe above averaging of permittivity only applies to the field components tangential\nto material interfaces and for the case of TE polarisation considered in our simulations.\nIf it is required to apply the averaging schemes to materials with planar boundaries for\nTM and three-dimensional (3-D) cases or even for structures with curved surfaces, one\ncan follow the procedures introduced in [31, 32].\n3. Numerical Implementation\nFor simplicity, in our simulations we assume that the plasma frequency is \u03c9pe = \u03c9pm =\n\u221a\n\u03c9p = 2\u03c9 where \u03c9 is the operating frequency, therefore matched LHM slabs are\nmodelled in our simulations. A small amount of losses is used i.e. \u03b3e = \u03b3m = \u03b3 =\n0.0005\u03c9 which gives relative permittivity and permeability \u03b5r = \u03bcr = \u22121 \u2212 0.001j to\nensure the convergence of simulations. It is worth mentioning that there is a small\namount of mismatch between numerical (in FDTD domain) and analytical permittivity\n(1) which is caused by FDTD time discretisation [28]. However, such a mismatch causes\nthe amplification of transmission coefficient only for lossless LHM slabs or when the\nlosses are very small. For the amount of losses used in our simulations, the effect of\nmismatch is damped and no amplification is found in transmission coefficient. The effect\nof FDTD cell size on this mismatch is analysed in later sections.\n\n\fd/2\n\nimage plane\n\nL\n\nLHM\n\nd\n\nperfectly matched layer\n\nperiodic boundary condition\n\nsource plane\n\nx\nperfectly matched layer\n\n9\n\ny\n\nperiodic boundary condition\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of two-dimensional (2-D) FDTD simulation domain for\ncalculation of numerical transmission coefficient\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, an infinite LHM slab is modelled by applying the Bloch's\nperiodic boundary conditions (PBCs). For any periodic structures, the field at any time\nsatisfies the Bloch theory, i.e.\nE(x + L) = E(x)ejkx L ,\n\nH(x + L) = H(x)ejkx L ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere x is any location in the computation domain, kx is the wave number in x-direction\nand L is the lattice period along the direction of periodicity. When updating the fields\nat the boundary of computation domain using the FDTD method, the required fields\noutside the computation domain can be calculated using known field values inside the\ndomain through (28). Since infinite structures can be truncated with any period, for\nsaving computation time, we have used only four FDTD cells in x-direction (L = 4\u2206x).\nAlong y-direction, the Berenger's original perfectly matched layer (PML) [37] is used\nfor absorbing propagating waves (kx < k0 ), and the modified PML [38] is used when\ncalculating the transmission coefficient for evanescent waves (kx > k0 ). A soft planewave sinusoidal source (which allows scattered waves to pass through) with phase delay\ncorresponding to different wave number is used for excitations,\nHz (i, js ) = Hz (i, js ) + s(t)e\u2212jkx i\u2206x ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere js is the location of source along y-direction, s(t) is a time domain sinusoidal\nwave function, i \u2208 [1, I] is the index of cell location and I is the total number of cells in\nx-direction (I = 4 in our case). By changing the values of wave number kx , either pure\npropagating waves (kx < k0 ) or pure evanescent waves (kx > k0 ) can be excited.\nThe spatial resolution in FDTD simulations is \u2206x = \u2206y = \u03bb/100 where \u03bb is the free\nspace wavelength at the operating frequency. According to the stability criterion [3], the\n\u221a\ndiscretised time step is \u2206t = \u2206x/ 2c where c is the speed of light in the free space. As\nillustrated in Fig. 2, the source plane is located at a distance of d/2 to the front interface\nof the LHM slab where d is the thickness of the slab. Therefore the first image plane\nis at the centre of the LHM slab and the second image plane is at the same distance\nof d/2 beyond the slab. The spatial transmission coefficient is calculated as a ratio of\n\n\f10\n\nTransmission coefficient, |T|\n\n10 2\nAnalytical\nFDTD (with avg. Dx = l/100)\nFDTD (no avg. Dx = l/100)\nFDTD (no avg.

Comparison of transmission coefficient of infinite planar LHM slabs\ncalculated from exact analytical solutions and dispersive FDTD method with and\nwithout averaging of permittivity along the boundaries of LHM slabs.\n\nthe field intensity at the second image plane to the source plane for different transverse\nwave numbers kx after the steady-state is reached in simulations.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission coefficient for an infinite planar LHM slab with\nthickness d = 0.2\u03bb calculated using the FDTD method with and without averaging of\npermittivity along the boundaries, and its comparison with exact analytical solutions.\nIt can be seen that using the arithmetic mean of permittivity, the numerical results show\nexcellent agreement with analytical solution using spatial resolution \u2206x = \u03bb/100. Good\ncorrespondence can be also obtained when the FDTD cell size is increased to \u2206x = \u03bb/80.\nOn the other hand, without averaging, the material boundary is not correctly modelled\nwhich introduces an amplification (resonance) at a location of approximately kx = 2.4k0\nin transmission coefficient for the case of \u2206x = \u03bb/100. Reducing FDTD cell size to\n\u2206x = \u03bb/200 and \u2206x = \u03bb/400, the behaviour of the resonance remains similar but the\nlocation shifts to kx = 2.8k0 and kx = 3.2k0 , respectively. Therefore we predict that\nonly if a very small FDTD cell size is used in simulations that the results can converge\nto the right solution. Such a comparison demonstrates the significance of the averaging\ntechnique. Conventionally the arithmetic averaging is only a second-order correction\nfor modelling of conventional dielectric slabs, however it is shown in Fig. 3 that for\nmodelling of LHM slabs, the averaging becomes an essential modification.\nThe results shown in Fig. 3 may explain some incorrect results obtained previously.\nFor instance, the amplification of transmission coefficient in [26,27] is caused by incorrect\nmodelling of material boundaries, but such amplification is pure numerical and does not\nexist in actual LHM slabs [33, 34]. It is claimed in [39] that the imaging property of\nfinite-sized LHM slabs is significantly affected by their transverse dimensions, which we\n\n\f11\nsuppose that the conclusion is drawn from incorrect numerical simulations. We have\nperformed accurate simulations using averaging of material properties and confirmed\nthat the resolution of a near-field lens using LHMs is free from its transverse aperture\nsize [30].\nIn our simulations for the calculation of transmission coefficient, we have used\nPBCs in x-direction to model infinite structures and averaged permittivity along the\nboundaries in y-direction. If one requires to model finite-sized structures (in both\nx- and y-directions), the averaged permittivity/permeability needs to be used for the\ncorresponding tangential component along the boundaries in both directions.\nBesides the averaging technique used along the boundaries of LHM slabs, there are\nother numerical aspects in FDTD simulations in order to model the behaviour of LHM\nslab correctly and accurately. These aspects are introduced respectively in following\nsections.\n4. Effects of Numerical Material Parameters\nUsually for modelling of conventional dielectrics, the results are assumed to be accurate\nenough i.e. the effect of numerical material parameters can be ignored if an FDTD cell\nsize of smaller than \u2206x = \u03bb/20 is used. However since the discretisation introduces a\nmismatch between numerical and analytical permittivity/permeability, when modelling\nLHMs, especially when the evanescent waves are involved, the FDTD spatial resolution\nhas a significant impact on the accuracy of simulation results. The effect of numerical\npermittivity/permeability is originally reported in [28] for lossless LHMs using the (E,\nJ, H, M) scheme. Following the same procedure one can also obtain the numerical\npermittivity/permeability for the case of lossy LHMs. In this paper, the numerical\npermittivity/permeability (for lossy LHMs) is derived for the (E, D, H, B) scheme.\nIn the case of plane waves, when\nEn = Eejn\u03c9\u2206t ,\n\nDn = Dejn\u03c9\u2206t ,\n\n(30)\n\nEq. (13) reduces to Dn = \u03b5\u0303En , where \u03b5\u0303 is the numerical permittivity of the following\nform:\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b5\u0303 = \u03b50 \uf8f01 \u2212\n\n\u03c9p2 (\u2206t)2 cos2\n2 sin\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n2 sin\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\n2\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\n2\n\n\u2212 j\u03b3\u2206t cos\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\n2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u0011\uf8fb .\n\n(31)\n\nIf the collision frequency \u03b3 = 0, then (31) reduces to the numerical permittivity for\nlossless LHMs given in [28].\nPreviously we have used an FDTD cell size of \u2206x = \u03bb/100 in simulations.\n\u221a\nSubstitute the corresponding time step \u2206t = \u2206x/ 2c and the operating frequency, we\ncan obtain the numerical relative permittivity from (31) as \u03b5\u0303r = \u22120.9993 \u2212 0.0010j.\nAlthough there is a mismatch between the real part of relative permittivity and\n\u22121, the loss in LHMs damps such a mismatch and the simulation results show very\ngood accuracy. However if we increase FDTD cell size, the numerical permittivity\nintroduces severer mismatch which causes the discrepancy between FDTD simulation\n\n\f12\n2.5\n\nTransmission coefficient, |T|\n\nFDTD\nAnalytical\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\nk x /k0\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFigure 4.

Again using\n(31) we can estimate this mismatch and the numerical relative permittivity reads\n\u03b5\u0303r = \u22120.9959 \u2212 0.0010j. Using such permittivity in analytical formulations, we can\nobtain the corresponding transmission coefficient which is also plotted in Fig. 4 for\ncomparison. A good correspondence is shown and at high-wave-vector region, the\ndiscrepancy is cause by insufficient sampling points as for the case of using large cell\nsize (e.g. \u2206x > \u03bb/10) for conventional FDTD.\nAnother advantage of estimating the numerical permittivity is the correction of\nthe mismatch for FDTD simulations. After simple derivations, we can obtain corrected\nplasma frequency and collision frequency as\n\u03c9\u0303p2 =\n\u03b3\u0303 =\n\nh\n\n\u22122(\u03b5\u2032r \u2212 1) sin \u03c9\u2206t\n\u2212 \u03b5\u2032\u2032r \u03b3\u2206t cos \u03c9\u2206t\n2 sin \u03c9\u2206t\n2\n2\n2\n(\u2206t)2 cos2\n\n2\u03b5\u2032\u2032r sin \u03c9\u2206t\n2\n,\n(\u03b5\u2032r \u2212 1)\u2206t cos \u03c9\u2206t\n2\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\n2\n\ni\n\n,\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2032r and \u03b5\u2032\u2032r are the real and imaginary parts of the design relative permittivity \u03b5r ,\nrespectively. For the case of \u03b5r = \u22121 \u2212 0.001j, substitute \u03b5\u2032r = \u22121 and \u03b5\u2032\u2032r = \u22120.001\ninto (32) we get \u03c9\u0303p = 1.4157\u03c9 and \u03b3\u0303 = 5.0051 \u00d7 10\u22124\u03c9. Using the corrected material\nparameters, the FDTD simulation result and its comparison with analytical solutions\nare shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the mismatch has been canceled in FDTD\n\n\f13\n1.6\nFDTD\nAnalytical\n\nTransmission coefficient, |T|\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nk x /k0\nFigure 5. Transmission coefficient of infinite planar LHM slabs using the proposed\nFDTD method with averaged permittivity and with the correction of material\nparameters. The numerical permittivity in FDTD (\u2206x = \u03bb/40) is \u03b5r = \u22121 \u2212 0.001j.\nThe same permittivity is used to obtain the analytical solution for comparison.\n\nsimulations hence there is no amplification in transmission coefficient. Again the\ndiscrepancy with exact solutions in high-wave-vector region is caused by insufficient\nsampling points for such an FDTD spatial resolution of \u2206x = \u03bb/40. Therefore we\nsuggest to use FDTD cell size smaller than \u2206x = \u03bb/80 for modelling of LHMs especially\nwhen evanescent waves are involved.\n5. Effects of Switching Time\nConventionally for single frequency simulations, the source should be smoothly switched\nto its maximum value in order to avoid exciting other frequency components [23].\nFor modelling of LHMs, the switching time has even more significant effect on their\nbehaviour. It is well known that the switching time considerably influences the\noscillation of images and often thirty period is used as the switching time [25, 27].\nHowever, perhaps this is the reason that no stable images could be obtained in [23, 27]\nsince recently, it is reported in [40] that using a switching time of at least one hundred\nperiods one can obtain stabilised image for lossless LHMs.\nIn our FDTD simulations, we also notice that switching time influences the\noscillation of the field intensity at the image plane and hence the convergence time\nin simulations. We have performed FDTD simulations with different switching time\nequal to 50T0 , 150T0 and 250T0 where T0 is the period of the sinusoidal signal. The\nFDTD cell size is \u2206x = \u03bb/100 and corrected material parameters from (32) are used.\nIn order to ensure faster convergence, we have chosen larger amount of losses and used\n\u03b5\u0303r = \u22121 \u2212 0.01j in simulations. It should be noted that because high-wave-vector\n\n\f14\n1.4\n\nAmplitude (a. u.)\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nSwitching time 50T0\nSwitching time 150T 0\nSwitching time 250T 0\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n200\nTime ( \u0301T 0 )\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 6. The influence of different switching time on the convergence time in FDTD\nsimulation of infinite LHM slabs for a fixed wave number kx = 3k0 . The T0 is the\nperiod of the sinusoidal wave function at the operating frequency. The field intensity\nis taken at the second image plane of the LHM slab.\n\ncomponents travel very slowly in LHM slabs and the process of the growth of evanescent\nwaves requires a very long time to reach the steady-state, field values should be taken\nonly after total convergence is reached in simulations. For our case of \u03b5\u0303r = \u22121\u22120.01j, we\nhave used a criteria of 0.001% for detecting iteration errors and terminating simulations.\nIt is clearly shown in Fig. 6 that for a fixed wave number (kx = 3k0 ), the oscillation of\nfield intensity can be significantly suppressed by prolonging the switching time.\nIt is understandable that when the oscillation can be neglected, the convergence\ntime increases with the switching time. For demonstration of the impact of switching\ntime on convergence time, we have performed FDTD simulations with various switching\ntime. The collected data is plotted in Fig. 7. It can be seen that there exists an optimum\nswitching time when the minimum convergence time can be achieved for the case of\nkx = 3k0 . However for different wave vectors and different material parameters, the\nbehaviour of oscillation differs considerably and in certain cases the oscillation may last\nuntil a very long time. For practical simulations such as modelling of subwavelength\nimaging by a line source, since the source contains all wave vectors, therefore it is\nnecessary to switch the source slowly enough to ensure and speed up the convergence\nof simulations.\n6. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we have performed simulations of LHMs using the dispersive FDTD\nmethod.

The comparison with exact analytical solutions\ndemonstrates that the averaging of permittivity/permeability along the boundaries of\nLHM slabs is essential for correct and accurate modelling of LHMs. The numerical\npermittivity in FDTD is formulated where a mismatch between numerical and analytical\npermittivity is introduced by FDTD time discretisation. We suggest to correct such\na mismatch in order to model LHMs with their desired parameters in FDTD. The\nbehaviour of oscillation of field intensity for different switching time is also analysed.\nIt is shown that there exists an optimum value which leads to fast convergence in\nsimulations.\nReferences\n[1] V.
