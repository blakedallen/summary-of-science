INTRODUCTION\n\nThis millennium will mark the beginning of gravitational wave astronomy with the broad\nband observatories LIGO [1] and VIRGO [2]. This opens up new opportunities to probe\nstrongly gravitating processes in the coalescence of binaries and the birth of neutron stars\nor black holes [3\u20135]. The late stages of spiral infall of a neutron star may show interesting\nnew physics, for example, in association with tidal break-up around a companion black\nhole, where the onset will provide constraints on the density of neutron star matter. There\nmay also be surprises. Advanced LIGO is expected to see events up to a Gpc [4,5], and\nmight detect correlations or anti-correlations of gravitational radiation with cosmological\n\u03b3-ray bursts. The early stages of observations will be focused on verification of potential\ngravitational wave signals and identification of source by type. In view of the diversity\nof source parameters and serendipity in any new window of observations, it is of interest\nto consider model-independent detection algorithms. These algorithms are expected to\ncompare well with matched filtering, anticipating the inevitable model imperfections in both\nthe wave-forms and the instrumentation noise.\nEarly evolution of a binary of two stars of mass M1 and M2 with orbital period P is\n\n\u2217 mvp@schauder.mit.edu\n\u2020 sabhinan@in.ibm.com\n\n1\n\n\fwell-described by quasi-Newtonian evolution in the point-particle limit, whose luminosity\nLGW in gravitational wave emissions in the theory of general relativity is given by the Peter\nand Mathews' formula [6]\nLGW \u223c\n\n32\n(\u03c9M)10/3 F (e)\n5\n\n(1)\n\nin geometrized units with G = c = 1, where \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/P denotes the orbital angular velocity,\nF (e) accounts for an orbital ellipticity e and M = (M1 M2 )3/5 /(M1 + M2 )1/5 denotes the\nchirp mass. This is accompanied by a gradual rise in the orbital frequency forb = 1/P :\n96\n11/3\nf \u0307orb = (2\u03c0)8/3 M5/3 forb .\n5\n\n(2)\n\nThe predicted luminosity of 3.2 \u00d7 1033 ergs/s agrees with the observed rate of change 2.40 \u00d7\n10\u221212 in the orbital period of about eight hours in the Hulse-Taylor binary system with\nneutron star masses M1 = 1.42M\u2299 and M2 = 1.4M\u2299 [7]. This strong frequency-luminosity\nrelationship suggests to plot the evolution of a candidate source as a trajectory in the f \u0307(f )plane as the output of a detection algorithm. In doing so, we focus on burst sources whose\ngravitational waves show appreciable dynamics in their frequencies. This, in contrast to\nperiodic sources, e.g.: rapidly spinning neutron stars [8,9], which we regard as a separate\nclass of sources in regards to detection algorithms. Binary coalescence of compact objects,\nthen, shows an initial branch f \u0307 \u221d f 11/3 indicative of the general relativistic relationship\nLGW \u221d f 10/3 . These trajectories terminate on the f -axis at the quasi-normal mode frequency\nfQN R of a final black hole. For the expected low mass black holes M \u2264 10M\u2299 in compact\nbinaries, fQN R \u223c 2800(10M\u2299 /M) is beyond the (advanced) LIGO sensitivity range of about\n(20-1600Hz) 40-800Hz, however. The transition which connects the chirp to the final black\nhole state remains highly uncertain - here the gravitational radiation emission process is\nmost nonlinear and potentially most interesting. For black hole-black hole coalescence, the\ntransition from chirp to a common horizon envelope state should be smooth, may be very\nluminous [4] and more frequent [10] than neutron star-black hole coalescences [11\u201313]. In\nneutron star-black hole coalescence, on the other hand, an intermediate black hole-torus state\nis expected if the black hole spins rapidly [14]. This state is expected to be quiescent in its\ngravitational wave emissions, while luminous in emissions by the black hole in contact with\nthe magnetic field of the torus [15]. This predicts an anti-correlation between gravitational\nwave\u2013emissions and \u03b3-ray bursts from this type of catastrophic events [16]. Alternatively,\ngravitational radiation is expected in accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf into a\nneutron star or black hole due to a bar mode instability [17], or the collapse of a young\nmassive star [18,19], in which the relationship between f \u0307 and f is even more uncertain. If\nthe collapse stalls with the formation of a neutron star, we might witness a negative branch\nf \u0307 < 0 due to spin-down by gravitational wave emissions. It becomes potentially useful,\ntherefore, to plot transient gravitational wave emissions as trajectories in the f \u0307(f )-plane\nwhen classifying candidate detections by source-type [20]. As gravitational wave-emissions\nare not expected to be significantly beamed, observations such as these by advanced LIGO\n2\n\n\fcan obtain definite evidence of \u03b3\u2013ray burst progenitors and their population statistics which\nare not otherwise available.\nHere we describe an algorithm which enables accurate extraction of the frequency dynamics in the gravitational wave signal. The algorithm is based on counting zero-crossings,\nwherefrom an instantaneous frequency f (t) and frequency rate of change f \u0307(t) can be estimated as a function of observer's time t. Here the proposed algorithm is tested using\nsimulated binary coalescence with Gaussian noise and noise recorded on the 40m LIGO test\nfacility at Caltech. The algorithm is studied on signals of the type\nX(t) = A(t) cos(2\u03c0\u03a6(t)) + \u03c3 \u00d1 (t)\n\n(3)\n\nwth amplitude A(t) = (1 \u2212 t)\u22121/4 and phase\n\u03a6(t) = c\n\nh\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)5/8 + p 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)3/8\n\n\u0011i\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere t\u01eb[0, 1) is the time normalized to the time of coalescence t = 1, c = 1000 and p\u01eb[0, 1]\nis a model parameter: p = 0 in the Newtonian approximation and p = 0.6038 in the\n1PN approximation when M1 = M2 [21]. The noise process \u00d1(t) is normalized such that \u03c3\ncontrols the signal-to-noise ratio. All simulations are for data strings of a total of N = 10, 000\nsamples at tn = n\u2206t (n = 1, 2, * * * N). The instantaneous frequency f (t) is given by d\u03a6(t)/dt\nand d2 \u03a6(t)/dt2 denotes its rate of change f \u0307(t) with respect to time. The dimensionless rate\nof change of the period, f \u22122 f \u0307, expresses inversely the number of periods at a frequency\nf , which is of the order of a few hundred in the experiments reported below (final time\nt \u223c 0.97).\nII. DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM\n\nConsider the instantaneous frequency f (t) as a finite time-series for t \u01eb [a, b]. We begin\nwith a partition of [a, b] into N adjacent subwindows (bins) [si\u22121 , si ] with centers at ti =\n(si\u22121 + si )/2. Linear approximations f (t) \u223c \u03b1i + \u03b2i t (si\u22121 < t < si ) are then obtained by\nestimates of the coefficients \u03b1i and \u03b2i from the noisy data X(t) in each subwindow i. The\nR i\nf (t)dt = \u03b1i \u03b4 + \u03b2i ti \u03b4 + O(\u03b4 3),\nnumber of periods in the i-th subwindow, for example, is ssi\u22121\nwhere \u03b4 = si \u2212 si\u22121 .\nLet ZS (si\u22121 , si ) denote the number of zero-crossings of the true signal S(t) in the subR i\nwindow [si\u22121 , si ]. Then ZS (si\u22121 , si ) differs from 2 ssi\u22121\nf (t)dt by at most one. In view of\nf (t) = d\u03a6(t)/dt, our algorithm hinges on the approximation\nZS (si\u22121 , si ) \u223c 2\u03b4\u03b1i + 2\u03b4\u03b2i ti .\n\n(5)\n\nThe number of zero-crossings in the noisy data (X(u0 ), X(u1), * * * , X(uk )) in [si\u22121 , si ] will\nbe denoted by ZX (si\u22121 , si ), where the uj denote the discrete sampling times provided by\nthe AD-converter (16 bit resolution, 10kHz). The X(uj ) have expectation values S(uj ) and\n3\n\n\fvariance \u03c3 2 . The 10kHz-sampling frequency is assumed to be sufficiently high such that the\ntrue signal agrees with the zero-crossings of its linear interpolant based on the S(uj ). In\nterms of the indicator function, I, defined by I(P ) = 1 if P is true and I(P ) = 0 if P is\nfalse, we have\nZS (si\u22121 , si ) = \u03a3k1 I[S(uj\u22121)S(uj ) < 0], ZX (si\u22121 , si ) = \u03a3k1 I[X(uj\u22121)X(uj ) < 0].\n\n(6)\n\nThe probability pj that the observed signal X(uj ) and the its expectation (the true signal)\nS(uj ) have the same sign can be easily computed. Suppose that S(uj ) > 0. Then, we have\nP [X(uj ) > 0] = P [(X(uj ) \u2212 S(uj ))/\u03c3 > \u2212S(uj )/\u03c3] = 1 \u2212 F [\u2212S(uj )/\u03c3] = F [S(uj )/\u03c3], (7)\nwhere F is the probability distribution of the noise process \u00d1 (t), which is assumed to be\nsymmetric about zero. Similarly when S(uj ) < 0, we find P [X(uj ) < 0] = F [\u2212S(uj )/\u03c3]. It\nfollows that pj = F [|S(uj )|/\u03c3], whereby\nP [I[X(uj\u22121)X(uj ) < 0] 6= I[S(uj\u22121)S(uj ) < 0)]] = pj\u22121 (1 \u2212 pj ) + pj (1 \u2212 pj\u22121 ).\n\n(8)\n\nConsider, then, Ri = minj |S(uj )|/\u03c3, as a measure for the signal-to-noise ratio in the subwindow [si\u22121 , si ]. As Ri \u2192 \u221e, minj pj \u2192 1. We then have for the expectation E and the\nvariance V the limits\nlim E[ZX (si\u22121 , si )] = ZS (si\u22121 , si ), V [ZX (si\u22121 , si )] = 0.\n\nRi \u2192\u221e\n\n(9)\n\nHence, for large signal to noise ratios, we recover ZX (si\u22121 , si ) \u223c 2\u03b4\u03b1i + 2\u03b4\u03b2i ti .\nEstimates \u03b1i for f (ti ) and \u03b2i for f \u0307(ti ) can be calculated by linear regression. Define (as\nis usual in such regressions, see, e.g. [22]) the L2 error\n2\nQ(\u03b1i , \u03b2i ) = \u03a3N\n1 (ZX (si\u22121 , si ) \u2212 (2\u03b4\u03b1i + 2\u03b4\u03b2i ti )) .\n\n(10)\n\nLet \u03b1\u0302i , \u03b2\u0302i minimize Q(\u03b1, \u03b2). The regression estimates of the instantaneous frequency f (ti )\nand its rate of change f \u0307(ti ) are \u03b1\u0302i and \u03b2\u0302i respectively. As these are obtained simultaneously,\nthe f \u0307 are on equal par with f , rather than being their derivatives. Standard regression\ntheory allows us to compute error boxes in these estimates. Note that the method amounts\nto an approximation of the time-series f (t) by a piecewise linear, and generally discontinuous\nfunction.\nThe method may be optimized by modifying the present L2 norm in the error function\nto curve fitting, e.g.: different weights on f and f \u0307. Initial experiments indicate that the\nmethod can be implemented with adaptive window sizes, which may improve its efficiency\nwhen the dynamic range in the frequency f (t) is large.\nBecause only the pattern of zero-crossings is measured, the algorithm targets precisely the\nunderlying gravitational wave frequency-luminosity relationship of the source, as examplified\nin binary coalescence. The algorithm suppresses the amplitude of the signal, and hence it\nis robust to size fluctuations in the signal. Likewise, reference to the underlying cosine\nfunctions is weak. In fact, any 2\u03c0-function with two roots in each period can replace the\ncosine function in (1).\n4\n\n\fIII. NOISE DEPENDENCE\n\nThe frequency dynamics algorithm has been tested in simulated binary coalescence using\nthe Newtonian model of spiral in (p = 0) with Gaussian noise and the instrumental noise\nfrom the 40m-LIGO test facility at Caltech. The chirp extends over t = [0, 0.97), wherein\nthe number of periods at a given frequency f (t) decreases from above 400 to below 200.\nFigure 1 shows the results for both cases.\nThe algorithm obtains higher accuracy with the 40m-LIGO noise than with Gaussian\nnoise when the variance is high. We believe that the reason for this lies in the high-degree\nof dependence in the noise from the LIGO prototype. The first-order autocorrelations from\n40m-LIGO noise were of the order of 0.8. There were, on average, 15 zero-crossings per 100\nrecordings of the pure noise process. This is much smaller than the 50 or so zero crossings\nobtained for white noise of the same length. Thus the LIGO noise contributes far fewer\n\"false crossing\" due to noise as opposed to signal. This will be the case for all noise with\nlow-frequency components in the spectrum. In such cases, our algorithms performs even\nbetter than it would with white noise. To make the last point more precise, consider a\nGaussian process with a first order autocorrelation of \u03c1. If we observe a sequence of length\nN from such a process the expected number of zero-crossings is\n2\n\u03c1\n(N \u2212 1)\n1 \u2212 tan\u22121 \u221a\n2\n\u03c0\n1 \u2212 \u03c12\n\n!\n\nFor \u03c1 of 0.8, as in the LIGO case, we would expect approximately 20 zero crossings per 100\nrecordings. Of course, the LIGO noise from the Caltech prototype is not pure Gaussian, but\nthe principle is the same.\n\nIV. COMPARISON WITH MATCHED FILTERING\n\nOptimal application of matched filtering requires accurate models of the system to be\ndetected and the noise of the detector. Both aspects of prior knowledge are critical and\nmust be described in a low number of parameters, lest matched filtering becomes unstable.\nDetection of gravitational waves from forementioned candidate sources poses a number of\nuncertainties which may enter as model imperfections (e.g., size of neutron stars [23]). These\nimperfections can give rise to woefully wrong results when the true signal is not contained\nin the model for any choice of its parameters. It becomes of interest, therefore, to compare\nthe model-independence aspect of the frequency dynamics algorithm with the sensitivity\nof matched filtering to these imperfections. The comparison would be complete with an\nadditional on noise type and intensity which, however, falls outside the scope of this work.\nThe comparison is made using the post-Newtonian model in the 1PN approximation as the\ntrue signal (p = 0.6038), while applying matched filtering assuming the Newtonian model\ngiven by p = 0. This mismatch of model to true signal is used here to simulate other model\nimperfections, such as due to the finite size of the objects.\n5\n\n\fThus, the matched filtering model is perfect in case of p = 0, and becomes imperfect\nas p 6= 0. It is expected that matched filtering will outperform the frequency dynamics\nalgorithm for p = 0, and vice-versa for certain larger values of p > 0. The comparison is\nmade quantitative using a mean absolute relative error (MARE), expressed as a percentage,\nin the estimated frequencies by comparison with the known signal input:\nN\n100 X\n|f\u02c6(ti ) \u2212 f (ti )|\nMARE =\nN 1\nf (ti )\n\n(11)\n\nUsing a small Monte Carlo study, the comparison is made at three levels of additive Gaussian\nwhite noise. Figure 2 shows the results of this comparison study, where each reported MARE\nis the average of 200 simulations.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe trajectory in the f \u0307(f )-plane of a burst of gravitational radiation is expected to\nprovide a signature of the source. This is anticipated from the strong - possibly characteristic\n- coupling between the frequency and the luminosity of its gravitational wave emissions.\nBinary coalescence, for example, shows the characteristic chirp f \u0307 \u221d f \u03b1+1/3 associated with a\nluminosity LGW \u221d f \u03b1 , where \u03b1 = 10/3 in general relativity in the point-particle limit. Other\nburst sources of gravitational radiation may have different frequency dynamics (e.g.: different\n\u03b1's). We have described a nonparametric (model-free) frequency dynamics algorithm to\nobtain an accurate plot of the trajectory in the f \u0307(f )\u2212plane. It is based on zero-crossings\nin the gravitational wave signal, to extract these trajectories in the presence of noise. The\nmethod is robust against non-Gaussian additive noise and amplitude variations. The method\nshows good results at appreciable chirp rates and different types of noise. Even when\nthe signal-to-noise level is low (down to about 2 in our experiments), we can still recover\nthe distinctive curve of the frequency dynamics when f \u0307 is high. The estimation appears\nto be much more accurate for LIGO noise than for Gaussian noise when the variance is\nhigh. We believe that the reason for this lies in the high-degree of dependence in the\nnoise from the LIGO prototype, which suppresses \"false zero-crossings\" generated by the\nnoise. This will be the case for all noise with low-frequency components in the spectrum.\nIn such cases, our algorithm performs even better than it would with white noise. The\nfrequency dynamics algorithm has been compared with matched filtering, and shown to be\nsuperior in the presence of model imperfections. This is particularly relevant in searches for\nunanticipated burst sources.\nThe present experiments indicate that the algorithm should perform well in extracting\nthe frequency dynamics in the gravitational waves. Future experiments are desirable at very\nlow signal-to-noise levels, to study the detection limit for transient sources with the present\nalgorithm.\n\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgements.

The f \u0307(f )-diagram of simulated binary coalescence in the Newtonian approximation, extracted by the frequency dynamics algorithm in the presence of noise at a signal-tonoise ratio of about 4 (s = \u03c3 = 0.25). The horizontal axis shows the frequency f [Hz] and\nthe vertical axis its time rate of change df [Hz/s]. The top window shows the results with\nGaussian noise, and the lower window shows the results with the instrumental noise from\nthe 40m-LIGO test facility at Caltech. The crosses in the right windows denote horizontal\nand vertical errors obtained from the linear regression estimates. The results indicate that\nthe method improves when the noise is correlated. At higher frequencies, the results are\nsimilar due to a larger instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio.\nFigure 2. Experiments on model-independence in terms of the normalized error MARE on\nthe frequency, obtained by the frequency dynamics algorithms (lines) and matched filtering\n(dashed) at three different variances \u03c3 2 = 0.01, 0.15, 0.25. The comparisons are made for\nthree different signals, parametrized by the value of p (horizontal axis). Matched filtering\nis performed with model assumption p = 0, hence p 6= 0 in the signal simulates a model\nimperfection. The results show that the frequency dynamics algorithm outperforms matched\nfiltering in the presence of such appreciable model imperfections, with MARE approaching\na constant.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n\n[1] Abramovici A. et al., Science, 256, 325 (1992).\n[2] Bradaschia C. et al., Phys.
