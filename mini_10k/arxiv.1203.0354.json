Recently, exotic proximity effects have been observed\nin various systems, such as superconductor-metallic nanowires6-8 and graphenesuperconductor structures5.\n\nHowever, it is still not clear how superconducting order\n\npropagates spatially in a heterogeneous superconductor system. Here we report intriguing\ninfluences of junction geometry on the proximity effect for a 2D heterogeneous\nsuperconductor system comprised of 2D superconducting islands on top of a surface metal.\nDepending on the local geometry, the superconducting gap induced in the surface metal\nregion can either be confined to the boundary of the superconductor, in which the gap\ndecays within a short distance (~ 15 nm), or can be observed nearly uniformly over a\ndistance of many coherence lengths due to non-local proximity effects.\n\n1\n\n\fThe sample system is comprised of superconducting 2D Pb islands on top of a single\natomic layer surface metal, the stripe incommensurate (SIC) phase of Pb overlayer on Si(111)1518\n\n. The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image shown in Fig. 1 captures a variety of\n\njunction configurations. Fig. 1(A) shows an interesting \"\u043f\" shape Pb island 5 monolayers (ML)\nthick on top of the striped incommensurate (SIC) surface.\n\nPrevious scanning tunneling\n\nspectroscopy (STS) studies have shown that the SIC phase is superconducting with TC_SIC = ~\n1.8 K19 while the 2D Pb islands have a TC around 6 K20, although the actual TC value also\ndepends on the lateral size as well as its thickness21. At 4.3 K the SIC template is in the normal\nstate. At locations far from the Pb-islands, the tunneling spectrum exhibits no gap (spectrum #2\nin Fig. 1(B)), while the spectrum acquired at the 2D Pb island shows a clear superconducting gap\n(spectrum #3). In the SIC region near the 2D Pb island, a superconducting gap can also be\nobserved (spectrum #1), indicative of a proximity effect. To address the spatial dependence, we\nperformed spectroscopic mapping over the same area, whose differential conductance at zero\nbias (zero-bias-conductance (ZBC)) is shown in Fig. 1(C). Since the ZBC directly correlates\nwith the size of the tunneling gap (the smaller the value of ZBC, the larger the tunneling gap) the\nlandscape of ZBC is a good representation of the landscape of the superconducting gap.\nThe ZBC image reveals a rich landscape. In some regions (e.g., region \u03b1), the induced\nsuperconducting gap decays very quickly within a very short distance from the\nSIC/superconductor (S) interface, while in region \u03b2 where the SIC wetting layer is surrounded\nby Pb islands from both sides, the induced superconducting gap is quite uniform. Similarly, in\nregion \u03b3 where the SIC region is near the \"recess\" of the Pb island, the induced superconducting\ngap propagates quite extensively. Fig. 1(D) illustrates the spatial dependence of the tunneling\n\n2\n\n\fspectra along the arrow (starting at position (1) and ending at point (2), as shown in Fig.1(A)),\ndisplaying a deep and uniform superconducting gap in the channel region which then decays\nquickly beyond the region marked by the dashed line.\nThese diverse superconductor configurations are investigated further according to the\nlocal junction geometry. Fig. 2 is the case for a simple S \u2013 Normal metal (N) junction with the\nnormal metal region being the SIC template. The STM image and corresponding ZBC image are\nin Fig. 2(A) and (B), respectively. The short ranged proximity effect at the SIC surface near the\njunction interface is clearly evident from the ZBC image and this can be confirmed in the color\nscale plot of dI/dV in Fig. 2(C) taken along the arrow labeled in Fig. 2(A). Shown in 2(D) are\nthe line profiles of ZBC across the junction and the profile of superconducting gap along the\nsame line (\u0394 vs. x). Note that the ZBC scale is upside-down to be consistent with the strength of\nthe gap. The gap value is obtained by fitting the normalized dI/dV spectra with the BCS density\nof state (examples shown in inset)1. More detailed descriptions of the gap value deduction can\nbe found in Ref. 20 and 21. From the ZBC vs. x, as well as \u0394 vs. x line profiles, a proximity\nlength of about 12 nm is deduced. We have studied many simple S-SIC junctions and found a\nconsistent behavior: In all cases, the induced gap decays very quickly from the interface with a\nproximity length of 15\u00b15 nm. In addition, the gap value in isolated Pb islands is always very\nuniform (to within 5%). Nevertheless, a hint of very small decay (< 5%) can be identified\noccasionally (as shown in Fig. 2(D)). Except for the fact that \u0394 is very uniform up to the very\nedge of Pb islands, this observation is qualitatively consistent with a phenomenological\ndescription by Tinkham22 as summarized in Fig. 2(E). In this picture, the decay length in the\nmetal, \u03beM, is predominantly a property of the metal in proximity contact with S, \u03beS is the\n\n3\n\n\feffective superconducting coherence length, and b is the extrapolation length which depends on\nthe nature of the junction. In our case, \u03beM is about 15 nm while b is very large (in the limit of b\n\uf0e0 \u221e, the \u0394 in S would be a constant). \u03beM depends on the mean free path of the SIC surface metal\nwhich inevitably contains crystallographic defects. A large b value may be a result of the fact\nthat most of the S island edge interfaces with the vacuum and the S-SIC interface exists only\nalong the bottom edge, which is a line contact a single atom thick.\n\nThe simple S-S\n\nheterojunction follows the conventional picture where the order parameter changes continuously\nacross the interface with a characteristic length scale of about 25 nm on either side of the\njunction (Fig. 2(F)). Interestingly, this characteristic length scale turns out to be very similar to\nthe coherence length deduced from magnetic susceptibility measurements on Ge-capped thin Pbfilms25.\nThese conventional behaviors of proximity effects at a simple single-sided S-N or S-S\njunction change dramatically in a more complicated junction geometry. Fig. 3(A) shows two\nseparated Pb islands with the SIC layer in between, creating a variety of junction geometries.\nFor example, along arrows 1 and 2 are S-N-S heterojunctions with different widths of SIC (N) in\nbetween. Also marked with arrow 3 is a simple S-N junction. We map out the induced\nsuperconducting gap as a function of distance in the SIC regions along these three arrows using\nSTS. The resulting \u0394 vs. x profiles at two different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 3(B). Also\nshown in Fig. 3(C) and Fig. 3(D) are the color-scale representation of the dI/dV maps along the\ntwo S-N-S double junctions. The spatial mapping of spectra along the arrow (1) revealed a\nsurprisingly uniform and well-developed superconducting gap, in contrast to a quick decay of\ninduced gap being observed for the simple S-N junction of arrow (3). Similarly, along arrow (2)\n\n4\n\n\fthe induced gap is also relatively uniform, albeit with a smaller gap value than that along arrow\n(1). Most surprisingly, this relatively uniform gap value extends over a length scale which is\nabout 4 times the characteristic decay length (\u03beM ~ 15 nm), indicating that the S-N-S junction is\nfundamentally different from the one-sided S-N junction. A uniform \u0394 vs. x characteristics is not\nconsistent with a simple superposition of two single-sided S-N junctions. We observe this nonlocal proximity effect in all S-N-S double junctions with widths of up to 90 nm. Considering\nthat the Pb island and the SIC wetting layer is connected only through a line contact of one atom\nthick, this extended proximity effect is quite astonishing.\nThis enhanced proximity effect in the double-sided junction is also observed in the\nsurrounded junction where a hole (or a few holes) exposes the SIC in a Pb island (see Fig. 4(A)).\nIn such \"surrounded\" junctions, we observe a robust superconducting gap in the SIC for holes\nwith an effective diameter of up to 60 nm. The ratio between the gap value measured in the hole\nand that measured in the surrounding Pb island remains relatively constant over a wide range of\ntemperatures. Fitting \u0394 vs. T with the BCS model, one finds that the data at different spatial\nlocations (Pb island, different holes) converge to the same TC due to this constant gap ratio.\nSince the superconducting gap observed in the SIC is induced by the proximity effect, the\nconvergence to the same TC may not be a surprise.\nThe ratio between the gaps measured on the surrounding Pb islands and at the center of\nthe SIC structures shows a systematic trend with respect to the effective hole diameter of the\nsurrounded junction (larger diameter, smaller gap), as shown in Fig.4(B). Similar trends can be\nobserved for the two-sided S-N-S junction albeit with a steeper slope by about a factor of two.\n\n5\n\n\fThese rich phenomena exemplify the intriguing manifestations of junction geometry on\nthe proximity effect. At a simple S-N junction, the induced gap exists very locally, being\nconfined within a length scale of \u03beM ~ 15 nm. On the other hand, if there is another Pb island\nnearby, then the induced gap persists to a length scale many times \u03beM. Such a behavior is in\nstark contrast to the conventional picture predicted by solving the GL equations. We note that in\na recent investigation of 1D S-N-S junction, minigaps exist in the normal metal nanowires over\nan extended region8. Moreover, the result is quantitatively consistent with the solutions of the\nnon-linear Usadel equation10. Applying the Usadel equations using the parameters determined\nexperimentally in the simple S-N junction (see supplemental information)10-12, one finds the\nsolution reproduces a \"uniform\" value of minigap in the normal metal region, whose value\ndecreases as the width of normal region increases. However, we also noted clear numerical\ndifferences associated with dimensionality. Experimentally, the gap decrease linearly with L\nwhich deviates from the 1D Usadel solutions (see Fig.4(B)). In addition, there exist other\nprofound geometric influences (such as curvature, shape of the junction, and the effect of a\nsurrounded junction) on the proximity effect in complex superconductor \u2013 metal junction\ngeometries. These complicated superconducting gap landscapes can be qualitatively understood,\nhowever, by considering the possible multiple Andreev reflections. For example, in Fig 1(C)\none can see that in region \u03b1 where the SC island bends into the SIC, a very short decay length is\nobserved. One the other hand, in region \u03b3 where the SIC bends into the S island, the induced\nsuperconducting gap exists over a more extended range since more semi-classical Andreev\nreflections are allowed by the local geometry. The multiple reflections also explain why in the\nsurrounded junction (hole in SC island) the induced superconducting gap is so much more robust\nthan that in the SC-SIC-SC junction, as illustrated Fig. 4(A) and (B).\n6\n\n\fIn summary, our experiments have given us unprecedented spatial detail on the\nsuperconducting proximity effects in spatially inhomogeneous superconducting-normal systems.\nWe have found that certain island geometries provide \"conventional\" proximity effects, while\nother geometries reveal a wealth of information about how the \"shape\" of a superconductor and\nthe junction influence superconductivity. In particular, we find a type of \"giant\" proximity effect\nin a very conventional superconducting system that can be engineered through geometry alone.\nThis observation may enable new functionality in superconductor-based devices, and may\nportend even more intriguing phenomena in spatially inhomogeneous superconducting-normal\nsystems composed of \"exotic\" superconductors.\n\nAcknowledgements: We are grateful to Leonid Glazman and Alex Kamenev for discussions,\nand to grants ARO W911NF-09-1-0527 and NSF DMR-0955778.\n\nMethods\nSample Preparation\nThe experiments were conducted in a home-built low temperature STM system with an insitu sample preparation chamber. A Pb-Si reconstructed surface of the striped incommensurate\n(SIC) phase was prepared by deposition of ~ 1ML of Pb onto the Si(111) 7 \u00d7 7 surface at room\ntemperature, followed by sample annealing at 400 ~ 450 oC for 4 min to form the surface\ntemplate (see supplementary Fig. S1). In order to get 2D islands, Pb was deposited on the\ntemplate at ~ 200 K with a deposition rate of 0.5ML per minute. Before transferring in-situ to\n7\n\n\fthe LT-STM stage, the sample is annealed shortly at ~ 200 K for 3 minutes. Pb 2D islands on\ntop of SIC surfaces with a various shapes and thicknesses make an ideal system to investigate the\ninfluence of geometry on proximity effects.\n\nScanning Tunneling Spectroscopy\nElectro-chemically etched tungsten tips treated with in-situ e-beam cleaning were used for\nall measurements. All differential conductance spectra were taken with the same tunneling\nparameter with the junction stabilized at Vs = 20 mV and It =30 pA tunneling current. To\neliminate possible piezo creeping and thermal drift, piezo scanner (an STM tip) is stabilized at\nthe required area for more than 8 hours at 4.3 K prior to each zero-bias-conductance (ZBC)\nmeasurement. The same tunneling parameter (stabilized at 17 mV with 20 pA tunneling current)\nwas used for all ZBC measurement.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure legends\nFigure 1\n(A) STM topography image of a \"\u043f\" shape Pb island sitting on top of SIC surface (sample bias\nVs = 0.3 V, tunneling current It = 10 pA).

Although Pb island shapes can be varied as\nfound in Fig. S2(A,C), there is a universal rule on determining the strength and spatial\ndependence of induced superconducting gaps on the normal state SIC surfaces; i.e. lateral\nproximity effects. Whenever Pb islands form confined geometries with respect to SIC\nsurfaces, the significant enhancement of proximity effects can be observed as shown in\nthe marked areas of the ZBC images in Fig. S2(B,D).\n\nThe Usadel Equation and Its Solution at T=0\nThe starting point for describing the local tunneling density of states is the one\ndimensional retarded Usadel equation recast in a parameterization for the specific case\nwhere there is zero phase difference between superconducting order parameters at the\nboundaries [5, 2],\n\nwhere E is the energy,\n, parameterizes the local superconducting order parameter,\n\u0394 x is the position-dependent gap function, and D is the diffusion constant in the SIC.\nWe also make the approximation that the gap function \u0394 vanishes in the SIC but remains\nconstant and uniform in the superconducting islands, \u0394 ,\n\u0394. Making the change of\nvariable\n,\n, the boundary value problem becomes,\n\n1\n\n\fand \u221e\n\u221e, where is length of the\nfor the one-dimensional region\nSIC bounded by superconducting islands. The local tunneling density of states (LDOS) at\nand energy E is related to by [5, 2],\n\nwhere\nis the density of states in the normal metal. The boundary value problem (BVP)\n(2) is then numerically solved by discretizing the differential equation in -space and\nemploying the relaxation method with a simple initial guess [6, 3]. A hundred points were\n\u20442 , \u20442 . With lengths measured in units of coherence\ntypically used to discretize\n/\nlength\n\uf0d1D\u2044\u0394\nand energies in meV, (2) was then solved for various values of ,\nbelow and above \u0394. LDOS(0, ) Im[sinh 0, ] was then used for comparison with\nexperiment. Shown in Fig. S3 is a solution to (2).\n\nDetermining and for = 4.3K\nMeasurements were taken at\n= 4.3K which has the effect of thermally\nbroadening all tunneling measurements which we take into account by convoluting with\nthe first derivative of the Fermi function,\n[4]. In addition, Gaussian\nbroadening was included to account for any additional experimental noise. Deep inside\nthe superconducting region, the BCS expression for the density of states may be used to\ndescribed the observed the tunneling density of states,\n\nComparisons of measurements in the superconducting (SC) Pb islands (of similar\nthickness to the regions of interest) at 4.3K to the BCS expression for the tunneling\ndensity of states determines \u0394 to be 1.1meV at noise level = 0.81meV. We take \u0394 =\n1.1meV in all subsequent calculations and the same level of noise.\nTo determine the coherence length , a fit was made to data from the SIC in the vicinity\nof a single SC island, or SC-normal (SN) geometry. This SN geometry in one dimension\nhas a known solution to the Usadel equation [1] given as follows\n\n2\n\n\fwhere = 0 is the boundary with the SC. In equation (4), = 0 corresponds to the center\nof the SNS junction. From this exact expression (6), the zero energy or zero bias, = 0\ndensity of states is then compared to zero bias tunneling data at varying distances from\nthe superconductor. Again before comparison with data, all numerical curves are thermal\nand then Gaussian broadened as was discussed above. Fig. S4 is a fitted plot against the\nzero bias conductance data which yields a coherence length of\n22nm.\n\nSIC surrounded by Superconductors: Experiment and Theory\nWe use the parameters of the previous section to compare theory and\nmeasurements taken from a SIC bounded by two superconducting islands. An interesting\nobservation for the S-N-S (Pb-SIC-Pb) double junction is the difference in dI/dV spectral\nline-shape between those acquired at the Pb islands and those acquired at the SIC as\nshown in Fig. S5(A). While the spectra acquired in the SIC show a shallower ZBC and a\nnarrower separation between the coherent peaks (both are consequence of a smaller gap),\nthe amplitude of the coherent peaks turns out to be quite strong with a line shape that\ndiffers from the BCS prediction as shown in Fig. S5(B).\n\nReferences\n[1] Wolfgang Belzig, Christoph Br\u00fcder, and Gerd Sch\u00f6n.
