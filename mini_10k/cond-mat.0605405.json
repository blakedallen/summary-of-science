An old story\n1\n\nIn 1834 J. Scott-Russel observed a \"singular and\nbeautiful phenomenon\" in the form of \"a large solitary\nelevation...which continued his course along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution\nof speed...\". This phenomenon recently resurfaced in a\nquantum version remaining as exciting as well, as we will\ndiscuss extensively in this paper, singular.\nIts mathematical description was formulated some\nyears later by Korteweg and de Vries2 who proposed a\none dimensional classical nonlinear wave equation to describe it. This equation (so called KdV) has nonlinear solutions in the form of localized, nondispersing waves. But\nit was only in the 1960's, with the development of large\nscale computer simulations3 on dynamical systems, that\nit was realized that not only a single solitary wave solution was stable but that a set of \"solitary waves\" entering into collision they emerge after the collision with unchanged velocities and shapes and only suffering a phase\nshift.\nSoon after this discovery, an impressive mathematical theory was proposed - the Inverse Scattering Method\n(ISM) - that solves the problem of time evolution of an\ninitial configuration in an classical nonlinear but integrable system by a series of linear operations. In other\nwords, this procedure is the analogue of the Fourier\nTransform for linear systems.4 Within this theory it was\nalso discovered that integrable systems are characterized\nby a macroscopic number of conservation laws that we\nbelieve are the key to their singular transport properties.\nAt this point we should mention a distinction between\nsystems with, (i) \"topological\" solitons (the stability of\nwhich is guaranteed by topological constraints) that in\ngeneral do not exhibit particular transport properties\nand, (ii) \"mathematical\" solitons, the stability of which is\nguaranteed by the very specific structure of the Hamiltonian describing them.5 A possible source of confusion are\nsystems as the sine-Gordon theory (classical and quantum) that are integrable but they also possess topological\nexcitations.\n\u2217 e-mail:\n\nzotos@physics.uoc.gr\n\nThe paradigm of classical integrable systems finds nowdays applications in all branches of science and engineering. We will just mention the example of nonlinear optics where the coding and transmission of information\nis by optical solitons in fibers described by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation,6 a classical integrable model.\nA key issue for applications, and as we will discuss below\nalso for quantum ones, is the robustness of dissipationless\ntransport to perturbations that destroy the integrability\nof the underlying system.\n2. The quantum world\nIn parallel to these developments, the first quantum\nintegrable system was discovered by H. Bethe in 19317\nwho proposed an exact form for the eigenfunctions and\neigenvalues for the prototype spin-1/2 one dimensional\nisotropic Heisenberg model. Over the years, a particular technique was developed, the Bethe ansatz (BA)\nmethod, that allows to extract physical information from\nthe rather complex eigenfunctions for a large class of\nquantum integrable models; for instance the Heisenberg,\nHubbard, supersymmetric t-J model,8, 9 to cite a few\nexamples of interest in the field of Condensed Matter\nPhysics. At the moment we can say that the thermodynamic properties of these models can analytically be\nstudied and compared to experiment but that the finite\ntemperature dynamic correlations, most relevant e.g. to\ntransport experiments, are not easy to handle.\nIn a key development in 1979, by L. Fadeev and collaborators, it was realized that the Bethe ansatz method is\nnothing else but a quantum version of the ISM and thus\nthere is a close analogy between classical and quantum\nintegrable systems.8 In particular, they have developed a\nsimilar method, the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method\n(QISM). Within this formalism, it can be shown that the\nquantum systems are also characterized by a macroscopic\nnumber of conservation laws, that can be systematically\nconstructed.\nA fundamental issue emerging from this analogy, and\nbeing a driving force in this field, is the extent to which\nthe physics and applications of classical integrable sys-\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nX. Zotos\n\nFull Paper\n\n6\n\ntems can be carried over to the the quantum ones, for\ninstance in the context of unconventional transport properties of (quasi-) one dimensional materials described by\nquantum integrable Hamiltonians.\n\nMost of the studies on transport properties of one dimensional quantum many body systems over the last few\nyears were within the linear response theory (Kubo formalism10 ). One fundamental quantity that attracted particular attention is the Drude weight D, defined as the\nweight of the zero-frequency contribution to the real part\nof the conductivity,\n\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03c9) = 2\u03c0D\u03b4(\u03c9) + \u03c3reg (\u03c9 > 0)\nor equivalently as the pre-factor of the reactive response\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = D/\u03c9|\u03c9\u21920 at low frequencies. As it follows from\nthis definition, a finite D implies a ballistic response.\nNote also for further use, that the d.c. conductivity is\ngiven by the \u03c9 \u2192 0 limit of the regular part, \u03c3dc =\n\u03c3reg (\u03c9 \u2192 0).\nThe Drude weight was first proposed by W. Kohn in\n1964 as a criterion of metallic or insulating behavior in\nthe context of the Mott-Hubbard transition.11 In particular, it was related to the response of the ground state\nenergy, of a system with periodic boundary conditions\nforming a ring, to a fictitious flux \u03c6 piercing the ring.\nRecently, the Kohn expression for the Drude weight\nwas generalized at finite temperature12 T . It is currently\nextensively studied in order to characterize the conduction of a system as ideal (ballistic - dissipationless) or diffusive. In an alternative, perhaps more physical, interpretation it can be shown that it is essentially proportional\nto the long time asymptotic value of the (e.g. charge,\nspin or energy) current-current correlations.13 The behavior of the Drude weight, although a seemingly simple\nquantity, still defies reliable characterization in several\nintegrable models that have been studied so far. This\nis because it is not a thermodynamic quantity and thus\ndifficult to analyze within known analytical methods.\nSimilarly, a thermal Drude weight Dth can be defined\nthat characterizes the thermal conductivity \u03ba(\u03c9) and it\nis proportional to the long time asymptotic of the energy\ncurrent-energy current dynamic correlations.\nThe finite frequency behavior of the conductivity is\nstill more involved and most known results are based\non low energy effective theories of the Hamiltonians of\ninterest or numerical simulations; for instance, variants\nof Exact Diagonalization (ED) via the Lanczos procedure (for a recent technique see the Microcanonical Lanczos Method14 and references therein) and the Quantum\nMonte Carlo method.15, 16\nThe numerical results are however limited to rather\nsmall size lattices considering the exponentially fast increasing number of states in quantum many body systems. This implies, on the one hand, limitations on the\ninformation that can be extracted on the long time,\nequivalently low frequency - \u03c9, behavior of the conductivities. On the other hand, it also implies limitations\non the smallest wave-vector - q correlations, of the order\nof 1/L, that can be evaluated. Thus it is difficult to ex-\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9)\n\n3.

Notice for instance, that any finite size system\nshows a nonzero Drude weight (as there is always a part\nof coherent transport in such a system), that however\nscales to zero in the thermodynamic limit if the system\nshows normal transport. From this observation we can\nalso conclude that in numerical simulations it is more\nadvantageous and reliable to study the high temperature limit where we expect a relevant \"mean free path\"\nto be shorter, hopefully less, than the size of the lattice.\nWe should also mention a recent, promising development, where by the Density Matrix Re-normalization\nGroup method17 (that has been proven so successful in\nthe study of ground state properties) the time evolution\nof an initial state can evaluated on fairly large size lattices. Further development of this method might give access at the finite temperature, out-of equilibrium dynamics of one dimensional quantum lattice systems.\nSo we conclude that it remains crucial, in this field of\nstrongly correlated systems, the development of reliable\nnumerical simulation techniques for the study of finite\ntemperature dynamic correlations. As they are related\nto transport are the most interesting for making contact\nwith experiment.\n4. A conjecture\nA few years ago,12, 18, 19 it was conjectured that integrable quantum many body systems show fundamentally\ndifferent finite temperature transport properties than the\n- generic - nonintegrable ones. According to the common\nscenario, illustrated in Fig. 1, a normal metallic system,\nwith no disorder, at zero temperature, shows a finite\nDrude weight D and thus a diverging d.c. conductivity.\nAs the temperature rises, due to Umklapp scattering, the\nzero-frequency Drude \u03b4\u2212function broadens to a peak of\nwidth of order 1/\u03c4 where \u03c4 is a characteristic scattering\ntime. Thus a finite d.c. conductivity \u03c3dc is obtained that\ndecreases with increasing temperature and decreasing \u03c4 .\nIn contrast, as it is illustrated in Fig. 2, in an integrable\nsystem this broadening with temperature does not occur. The Drude weight remains finite at all temperatures,\nbut with a nontrivial temperature dependence. Thus the\nsystem remains an ideal conductor, exhibiting ballistic\ntransport at all T . Note that we are concerned with the\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\n6\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9)\n\n3\n\n5.1 S=1/2\nThe Hamiltonian is given by the generic form,\n\n5\n\n_____ T = 0\n\n4\n\nH =J\n\n.....

Finite systems with boundaries would show a vanishing D and a d.c. conductivity\nproportional to the scattering by the boundaries.\nTwo main issues, arising in relation to this conjecture,\nare debated at the moment.\nFirst, it was proposed that even nonintegrable systems might also show ballistic transport at finite T ;20\u201322\nevidence so far indicates that it is probably not the\ncase. To appreciate the difficulty of this question, note\nthat despite extensive studies over the years in classical nonlinear one dimensional systems, it is still debated\nwhether the thermal conductivity might be diverging23\neven in nonintegrable ones. In particular, in several nonintegrable models, it was found that although the Drude\nweight (long time asymptotic of current correlations)\nvanishes, the integral over time of the dynamic correlation (that gives the d.c. conductivity) diverges with system size. Furthermore, the simulations were carried over\non systems with thousands of lattice sites, that indicates\nthe subtlety of the scaling procedure.\nSecond, it is unclear whether an integrable model in\nthe gapped phase (insulating) at zero temperature (e.g.\nhalf-filled Hubbard, easy-axis S = 1/2 Heisenberg, nonlinear \u03c3 model) turns to an ideal conductor or a normal\nmetal at finite temperatures.15, 24\u201330\nFinally, we want to remark that although most of the\nstudies focused on the behavior of the Drude weight, it\nstill possible that D might vanish but the low frequency\nbehavior of the conductivity will turn out to be unconventional, e.g. power law, implying a diverging d.c. conductivity or of a non-diffusive form.\n5. Three Heisenberg models\nSpin models are prototype quantum many body systems that offer the possibility to test the above conjecture. Their study is also relevant in the interpretation\nof experiments in quasi-one dimensional magnetic compounds.\nIn this section we will discuss the transport behavior\nof three one dimensional spin models, (i) one integrable,\nthe S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain and (ii) two nonintegrable\nones, the S = 1 and S = 1/2 2-leg ladder systems. We\nwill focus on open issues and discuss contradictions in\nthe results obtained by different approaches.\n\nwhere Si\u03b1 are components of S = 1/2 operators at site i\nand we consider the, J > 0, anti-ferromagnetic regime.\nFor |\u2206| < 1, the \"easy-plane\" case, the spectrum is gapless, while for \u2206 > 1, the \"easy-axis\" case, it is gapped.\nBy a Jordan-Wigner transformation, this spin model is\nequivalent to a spinless fermion system with hopping \u2212t\nand nearest-neighbor interaction V ; the correspondence\nof parameters is \u2206/J = V /2t. The model is integrable\nand its Bethe ansatz algebraic structure8 and thermodynamic properties have been extensively studied.9 Regarding the finite temperature dynamics, the picture on\nthe spin conductivity is still debated while the thermal\none is rather clear.\nFirst, it is easy to show that indeed this integrable system can exhibit ideal (ballistic) transport at all temperatures by using the fact that it is characterized by nontrivial conservation laws. In particular, it was shown,13 using\nan inequality proposed by Mazur and Suzuki,31 that D\nat high temperatures, \u03b2 = 1/\u03baB T \u2192 0, is bounded by\nthe \"overlap\" of the spin current operator j z with at least\nthe first nontrivial conservation law Q3 as (m =< Slz >),\nD(T ) \u2265\n\n\u03b2 < j z Q3 >2\n2L < Q23 >\n\n1 8\u22062 m2 (1/4 \u2212 m2 )\n=\n.\n2kB T 1 + 8\u22062 (1/4 + m2 )\n\n(2)\n\nThis idea, although very powerful in proving that such\na state - ideal conductor at all temperatures - exists, it\nprovides at the moment a rather incomplete picture of\nthe behavior of D. Indeed, we see from Eq. (2) that the\nr.h.s. vanishes at \u2206 = 0, the point that corresponds to\nthe XY model, where we know that the spin current\ncommutes with H and thus D is finite. Also, at magnetization m = 0, the r.h.s. also vanishes according to\nEq. (2) while independent BA32, 33 and numerical evaluations16, 21, 24, 34 show that it is finite in the \u2206 < 1 regime.\nThe same conclusion holds even including all conservation laws derived from the algebraic structure of this\nintegrable model8 as it can be seen by invoking their\n\"electron-hole\" symmetry.13\nRegarding the BA calculation32 at m = 0, it is based\non the assumption of a \"rigid string\" picture for the excitations proposed by Fujimoto and Kawakami25 in the\ncontext of the Hubbard model; notice that it can be done\nat the special values of \u2206 = cos(\u03c0/\u03bd), \u03bd =integer. It\npredicted a nonzero D for |\u2206| < 1 with a power law behavior at low temperatures as it can be seen in Fig. 3. In\nparticular:\n\u2022 at zero magnetization, in the easy plane antiferromagnetic regime (0 < \u2206 < 1), the Drude\nweight decreases at low temperatures as D(T ) =\nD0 \u2212 const.T \u03b1 , \u03b1 = 2/(\u03bd \u2212 1), \u2206 = cos(\u03c0/\u03bd);\n\u2022 in the ferromagnetic regime, \u22121 < \u2206 < 0, D(T )\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

Second, in effective field theories the dispersion relation is\nlinearized and it is not clear whether curvature effects\nmight affect the temperature behavior of D; note that,\nfor free fermions on a lattice, D decreases as T 2 at low\nT while with a linearized dispersion is constant.\nRegarding low energy effective theories, the canonical\napproach to one dimensional quantum systems, the Luttinger liquid theory, was applied to transport.35 In the\ncontext of this approach, it was recently stressed the importance of, (i) conservation laws36 in altering the behavior of transport - from diffusive to ballistic - and, (ii) correctly accounting perturbations irrelevant to thermodynamics but crucial for transport.37 We should emphasize\nthat it remains an outstanding problem, first, to match\nthe descriptions in terms of the original (non)integrable\nHamiltonian and its effective field theory, second, to account for curvature effects and, third, to trace the fate of\nconservation laws - present at all energies in BA systems\n- to low energies.\n\n\u22128\n\nMCLM\nED\n\n0.8\n\n20\n\nI\n\nFig. 3.

Numerical evidence in the\n\u03b2 \u2192 0 limit27 (shown in Fig. 4) and Bethe ansatz analytical results32, 33 suggest that D remains zero at all\ntemperatures. The data follow from Exact Diagonalization calculations for the smallest systems and the Microcanonical Lanczos method (MCLM) for the largest ones,\nwhile FM denotes a frequency moment analysis. Note the\ncrucial role of the MCLM technique in extracting sufficient information from the conductivity spectra. Very\nlarge finite size effects are observed in the low frequency\nbehavior of the conductivity that scale as 1/L and the\nsignificance of which is not clear at the moment. It is\ninteresting to examine whether they signify an unconventional low frequency-small wave-vector behavior that\nis not of the standard diffusive form. They also render\nparticularly difficult the analysis of the bulk system conductivity and the extraction, if there is one, of a value for\nthe d.c. conductivity. Also note that, one cannot exclude\nthe convergence of the finite frequency peak to a Drude\n\u03b4\u2212function in the thermodynamic limit, although such\na scenario is rather unlikely. We should remind that a\nsemi-classical theory for gapped systems by Sachdev and\ncollaborators predicts a normal diffusive behavior.28\nFinally, we will conclude with some open questions related to the issue of conservation laws and transport.\nFrom the Mazur inequality one could argue that the presence of only one conserved quantity is enough to guarantee a finite D and that integrability is not a necessary\ncondition. However, there are arguments that, at least\nwithin the BA systems, the presence of one conservation\nlaw guarantees the existence of a macroscopic number.\n\n\fX. Zotos\n\nFull Paper\n\n5.2 S=1\nA natural question coming up is, what about the transport behavior of the same Heisenberg model Eq. (1) but\nfor higher spin, e.g. S = 1, that is not an integrable\nmodel. The S = 1 case is known to be a gapped system44 and thus an insulator at T = 0 with D = 0.\nIts low energy physics is described by the quantum\nnonlinear \u03c3-model (qNL\u03c3M). A semiclassical treatment\nof this effective theory by Sachdev and collaborators,45\nthat essentially maps this system to a classical gas of different species impenetrable particles, concluded to diffusive dynamics. Note, that the classical model is also\nintegrable and can be analytically solved. On the other\nhand, as the nonlinear \u03c3 model is also an integrable field\ntheory, the Bethe ansatz method has been applied29, 30\nbut there it was concluded that the Drude weight is finite and thus the transport ballistic. This discrepancy\nraises the question whether, within the qNL\u03c3M model\ndescription, subtle quantum effects due the finite tunneling of the quasi-particles alter the transport behavior\nfrom diffusive to ballistic.\nMotivated by this problem and the theoretical and\nexperimental interest for the dynamics of S = 1 compounds, a numerical simulation in the high temperature\nlimit46 was performed. It indicates that both the spin\nand energy conductivities have finite d.c. values. The frequency dependence of the data however do not seem to\nfit a standard Lorenzian/diffusive form. The results for\n\u03ba(\u03c9) and \u03c3(\u03c9) are shown in Fig. 6 and 7 respectively.

Conversely, from\nthe case m = 0, it is not clear that the conservation laws,\nin the context of the Mazur-Suzuki (in)equality, exhausts\nthe Drude weight or even that the presence of at least\none is necessary for a finite D. Finally, on this problem,\nwe can also argue that if the BA analysis32 turns out to\nbe valid and D shows a non-analytic behavior at \u2206 = 1,\nthen one, or a finite number of conservation laws within\nthe Mazur inequality cannot reproduce this behavior.\nConcerning energy transport the situation is far more\nclear and simple. It was early on realized40, 41 that the\nenergy current in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg model commutes with the Hamiltonian, at it happens to coincide\nwith the so-called Q3 conservation law in the BA analysis. Thus it follows that the energy current correlations\ndo not decay in time and thus the thermal conductivity\ndiverges. The \"thermal Drude weight\" has been exactly\nevaluated using Bethe ansatz techniques42 for all values\nof the anisotropy \u2206.\nBased on the same idea, of a commuting energy current with the Hamiltonian, we finally mention a magnetothermal effect that has recently been proposed.43 In this\nphenomenon, a spin current would flow in the presence\nof a temperature gradient and a magnetic field, a phenomenon analogous to the thermoelectric effect for electronic systems. The study, using ED and QMC methods,\nfound a diverging transport coefficient resulting from the\nconservation of the energy current.\n\n5\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\u03b2\u21920\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\nFig. 6.

Zotos\n\nFull Paper\n\n5.3 S=1/2 2-leg ladder\nThe next question that must be addressed is the robustness of ideal transport of an integrable system to perturbations breaking integrability. Namely, whether the\npresence of an integrable point in interaction parameter\nspace is signaled by an enhanced conductivity and this\nover a finite region and not an infinitesimal one, e.g. one\nthat shrinks to zero as the system size increases to the\nbulk limit.\nIn this context, frustrated spin chain and ladder models have been studied20, 21 by numerical diagonalization\ntechniques with conclusions that are still debated, although it seems that the integrability-transport conjecture seems to hold. However, we should keep in mind\nthat the conclusions are drawn from numerical studies on\nrather small size lattices and thus extreme care is needed\nin drawing definite conclusions for the bulk system; no\nexact results are known so far.\nA system on which the question of robustness can be\nstudied is the S = 1/2 2-leg ladder model described by\nthe Hamiltonian,\n\n2\n10\n\nJ\u22a5= 0.2\nJ\u22a5= 0.5\nJ\u22a5= 1.0\nJ\u22a5= 2.0\n\n2\n\n8\n\n\u03badc/ \u03b2\n\nafter the development of the MCLM that allows to reach\nas low frequencies as possible and minimize statistical\nnoise due to finite size effects.\nBut first, the value of the Drude weight in the thermodynamic limit must be deduced as shown in Fig. 5.\nOn this point, we should mention that finite temperature data might create some confusion because, at low\ntemperatures, for systems with an even number of sites,\nthe Drude weight seems to scale upwards with increasing\nsystem size while at high temperatures it seems to scale\ndownwards, to zero. This observation could lead to the\nsuggestion that the transport is ballistic in this nonintegrable system. We think however, that the low temperature data should be considered with care as the crossing\npoint in temperature where the scaling direction reverses\nmoves to lower temperatures with increasing system size.\nThus the region of temperature where the scaling is upwards will shrink to zero in the thermodynamic limit.\nAlso note that in lattices with an odd number of sites\nDth scales downwards to zero at all T .\nThe conclusion that in the S = 1 isotropic Heisenberg model the d.c. conductivities are finite means that\neither the assumptions in the BA analysis of the nonlinear \u03c3 model are not warranted or that in the truncation\nfrom the full S = 1 model to the effective one, relevant\nfor transport terms are omitted that turn the diffusive\ntransport to ballistic.\nWe should also emphasize the drastic difference, as\nseen by comparing Fig. 4 and Fig. 7, in the finite size dependence of the low frequency conductivity between the\nintegrable S = 1/2 Heisenberg model for \u2206 > 1 and the\nS = 1 model, both gapped systems. In the S = 1 system,\nfinite size effects are limited to exponentially small, with\nsystem size L, frequencies while in the S = 1/2 to a 1/L\nfrequency range. Although both might converge to a finite d.c. conductivity, the significance of this difference\nin scaling is an open issue at the moment.\n\n2\n\nJ. Phys. Soc.

The interchain coupling J\u22a5 controls the perturbation breaking the integrability of the separate Heisenberg chains. Indeed, for J\u22a5 \u2192 0 the two chains decouple\nand the thermal conductivity of the ladder is the sum\nof the conductivities of each chain, that diverge as the\nenergy current of the Heisenberg chain model commutes\nwith the Hamiltonian.\nThis model is also of experimental interest as the finite\ntemperature transport of several compounds described\nby this Hamiltonian are recently investigated. The low\nenergy physics of this gapped system is also described by\nthe nonlinear \u03c3 model and extensive studies28, 47 based\non this approach have been performed. In particular, the\nanalysis by Sachdev and collaborators concluded to a\nfairly complete picture of diffusive dynamics.\nA recent numerical simulation study in the high temperature limit,48 again using the MCLM, also indicates\na finite d.c. thermal conductivity as shown in Fig. 8.\nThe frequency dependence, as in the S = 1 model, does\nnot seem to conform to a diffusive form. Furthermore, as\nshown in the inset, the d.c. thermal conductivity scales as\n(J/J\u22a5 )2 , diverging as it should in the limit of decoupled\nchains. This result is interesting because, first, it indicates that the influence of an integrable point (J\u22a5 = 0)\nextends to a finite, of order one, region in interaction parameter space and, second, the quadratic dependence on\nthe interaction is similar to that expected from a perturbative result. Notice however that the perturbation\nnow is around not an independent particle system, but\naround a fully interacting, albeit integrable, one.\nThus the conclusion of a finite d.c. conductivity at high\ntemperatures does not contradict the semiclassical treatment of the qNL\u03c3M at low temperatures, but the same\nproblematic as the one for the S = 1 model applies in\nthis case.\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\n6. A new mode of transport\nQuasi-one dimensional materials have been synthesized and experimentally studied since the 60's. Recently\nthere has been renewed interest in their transport properties as new materials where discovered - some in the class\nof cuprates - with very low disorder, very weak interchain\ncoupling and extraordinary transport properties.\nIn relation to the above theoretical developments we\nshould mention the NMR experiments by Takigawa and\nThurber49, 50 on S = 1/2 compounds (e.g. Sr2 CuO3 )\nthat show diffusive spin dynamics but with a diffusion\nconstant orders of magnitude larger than that expected\nfrom a classical moment analysis. Similarly, the spin dynamics of the S = 1 compound AgV P2 S6 has been investigated, indicating diffusive behavior in this case,51 at\nleast at elevated temperatures.\nThe phenomenon that attracted most interest recently52\u201357 is the strongly anisotropic and large in magnitude heat conductivity of quasi-one dimensional compounds attributed to magnetic excitations. These experiments where partly motivated by the prospect of ballistic conductivity, as predicted for the S = 1/2 Heisenberg model. Large thermal conductivities however were\nreported in ladder materials, e.g. (La, Sr, Ca)14 Cu24 O41 .\nNote that the S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain compounds\noffer the unique possibility to analyze directly the effect of spin-phonon scattering on thermal transport in a\nstrongly interacting system as the spin-spin scattering is\ntotally ineffective.\nThus, in connection to these experiments, we can conclude that:\n\u2022 They established a new, very efficient, mode of energy transport through magnetic excitations, similar in magnitude to metals but in insulators; the\nreason is that the characteristic magnetic exchange\ncouplings are in the eV range.\n\u2022 These novel materials have potential for technological applications.\n\u2022 They promote the study of prototype integrable\nmodels as the description of many of these compounds is in terms of, for example, the S =\n1/2 Heisenberg, Hubbard, sine-Gordon, nonlinear \u03c3\nmodel.\n7. Perspectives\nFrom the above discussion we can conclude with a series of open issues and probable developments:\n\u2022 The transport properties of integrable models are\nbound to be exactly evaluated following the development of appropriate Bethe ansatz techniques. These\nmodels offer the unique possibility of an analytical\nsolution and it is ironical that because of their solvability they also present unconventional transport\nproperties.\n\u2022 The transport of low energy effective theories, some\nof them integrable models, is to be settled.\n\u2022 The connection of high energy integrable models to\ntheir low energy effective field theories is to be clarified.\n\nX. Zotos\n\n7\n\n\u2022 Of fundamental interest for the interpretation of experiments and applications is the role of perturbations in breaking the ideal transport. Apparently\nunavoidable perturbations are phonons, disorder, interchain coupling.\n\u2022 New experimental systems for the study of one dimensional quantum transport will be developed. For\nthe time being magnetic compounds are the most\npromising, the electronic ones do not seem so ideal\nfor fundamental studies. But work is in progress in\ndeveloping artificial one dimensional structures as\nsuperlattices or self-assembled 1D systems on surfaces that will offer far more controllable systems\nfor the study of quantum transport.\nAcknowledgements\nOn this occasion I would like to thank the organizers of\nthe Conference Statistical Physics of Quantum Systems\n- novel orders and dynamics held in Sendai in July 2004\nfor giving me the opportunity to present these ideas.
