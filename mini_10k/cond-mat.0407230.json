The current noise is understood as fluctuations of the\nconfinement potential and tunneling barriers.

We use i (j) = 0 for the\nground state and i (j) > 0 for excited states.

Many\nstudies of 1/f noise have been carried out on singleelectron devices and semiconductor nano-structures.[912] However, most works have focused on the classical\nCB regime, where energy quantization is not important.\nIn this work, we studied the 1/f noise in the nonlinear\ntransport regime, and investigated the fluctu-ation of the\nelectrostatic potential and tunneling rate of the device.\nThe QD was fabricated in an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure using a dry etching technique and Schottky fine\ngates [See Fig. 1(a)].[6] All measurements were\nperformed in a dilution refrigerator in the temperature\nrange of T = 20 - 300 mK at zero magnetic field. We\napplied negative voltages, VL and VR, to two gate\nelectrodes to form a single dot (shown by a white circle).\nThe QD shows clear CB characteristics with a charging\nenergy of EC ~ 2 meV and clear quantized energy states\nwith typical energy spacing of ~ 100 \u03bceV. By adjusting\nVL and VR, the tunneling rates for the left and right\nbarriers, \u0393L and \u0393R respectively, are made strongly\nasymmetric (\u0393L ~ 3x108/s << \u0393R ~ 6x1010/s, which are\ndetermined from the VL and VR dependence of the nonlinear current).7 Figure 1(b) shows a single-electron\ntunneling peak obtained when VL was swept to change\nthe electrostatic potential. \u0393L does not change so much in\nthis small sweeping range.

In this nonlinear transport regime,\ntransport characteristics can be parameterized by the\nelectrochemical potential \u03b5i,j and tunneling rates \u0393L and\n\u0393R. In what follows, we discuss how much these\nparameters fluctuate.\nWe measured the fluctuation of the tunneling current\nwith a spectrum analyzer. Figure 1(c) shows typical\ncurrent noise spectra, SI(f), measured at different\ncondition, labeled A, B, and C in Fig. 1(b). The spectrum\nat C was measured at zero current in the CB region, and\nindicates the noise of our measurement system. The\nspectrum at A shows a 1/f like spectrum at low frequency.\nHowever, the spectrum at B shows smaller noise even\nthough the averaged current at B is higher than at A. We\nestimated the magnitude of current fluctuation \u2206I by\nintegrating the spectrum in a limited frequency range\nbetween 5 and 45 Hz, i.e.,\n\n\u2206I =\n\n\u222b\n\n45\n\n5\n\n[ S I ( f ) \u2212 S I .CB ( f )]df .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, the background noise spectrum, SI,CB(f), obtained in\nthe CB regime, is subtracted to estimate the noise only\nfrom the sample. We assume that this excess current\nfluctuation is dominated by the background charge\nfluctuation, which typically shows 1/f frequency\nspectrum. Shot noise is known as an intrinsic noise for\ntunneling devices, but the expected white noise spectrum\nof about 1.2x10-29 A2/Hz at 40 pA is smaller than the\nobserved spectrum. The noise in the control voltages may\nnot be eliminated completely, but it is irrelevant to the\ntemperature dependence described below.\n\nFigure 2(a) shows the current profile, I, observed at VDS\n= 300 \u03bcV and T = 20 mK, where nonlinear current flows\nonly through the ground state. The saturated current is\ngiven by e\u0393L in the strong asymmetric barrier condition,\nwhile the current profile is given by the thermal\ndistribution of electrons in the electrodes (described later).\nThe derivative of the current, |dI/dVL|, and the integrated\ncurrent fluctuation \u2206I are also shown in Fig. 2(b) and 2(c),\nrespectively. \u2206I becomes maximum at the edges of the\nconductive region, and the double-peak structure in the \u2206I\ncurve is very close to the |dI/dVL| curve. This indicates that\nthe noise is dominated by the fluctuation of the potential \u03b5\nrather than that of \u0393. When the magnitude of the potential\nfluctuation, \u2206\u03b5, is not very large, we can estimate it by\nusing the simple relation \u2206I = \u03b1\u22121|dI/dVL|\u2206\u03b5, where \u03b1 =\n0.14 eV/V is a conversion factor from the left gate voltage\nto the potential energy. In this particular condition, we\nobtained \u2206\u03b5 = 0.07 \u03bceV from the peak value at \u03bcd = \u03b50, 0\n(open circle) and \u2206\u03b5 = 0.16 \u03bceV at \u03bcs = \u03b50, 0 (solid circle).\nIn addition, small but nonzero current noise is seen in the\nconductive region between the two peaks in Fig. 2(c).\nSince |dI/dVL| is almost zero in this region, this small \u2206I\nshould come from the fluctuation of the tunneling rate,\n\u2206\u0393L. We estimated \u2206\u0393L to be 2.4x105/s, and then \u2206\u0393L/\u0393L ~\n10-3. Since the tunneling barrier in this device is formed by\ndepleting electrons by applying negative gate voltages, the\ntunneling rate should also be influenced by the fluctuation\nof the barrier height. The fluctuation of the dot potential\n(\u2206\u03b5) may also change the effective barrier height. When\nthe electron traps are uniformly distributed in the device,\nthe fluctuations of the barrier height and dot potential are\nconsidered to be the same magnitude and independent. In\nthis case, the observed \u2206\u0393L/\u0393L and \u2206\u03b5 should be related to\neach other [(\u2206\u0393L/\u0393L)/\u2206\u03b5 ~ 10 (meV)-1 from the noise\nmeasurement].\nThis relation can be inferred from two estimations.\nTunneling probability, W, through a parabolic potential\nbarrier, U(x) = U0 - 1/2me\u03c902x2, was calculated under the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouine (WKB) approximation using\nthe realistic parameters ; effective mass me, the\ncharacteristic energy h\u03c90 = 1 - 3 meV, and the effective\nbarrier height relative to the Fermi energy U0 - EF = 3 - 5\nmeV.14 The change of tunneling probability, \u2206W, for a\nsmall change of barrier height \u2206U0 is approximately given\nby (\u2206W/W)/ \u2206U0 = 2 - 5 (meV)-1, which is comparable to\nthe observed (\u2206\u0393L/\u0393L)/\u2206\u03b5. The other estimation was made\nexperimentally from the VL dependence. A small change of\nthe gate voltage, \u2206VL, induces excess charge on the gate\nelectrode. Since this gate electrode is located almost the\nsame distance from the tunneling barrier (about 100 nm)\nand from the QD (about 150 nm), the induced charge\nchanges the dot potential and the barrier height by almost\nthe same\n\n\f\u03bcd = \u03b50,0\n\n100\n\n\u03bcs = \u03b50,0\n\n0\n200\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b1I0/4kBT\n\n100\n0\n0.16\n\n(c)\n\n0.08\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n200\nTemperature (mK)\n\n300\n\nFig. 3.

From the VL\ndependence of the current characteristics, we obtain\n(d\u0393L/\u0393L)/d\u03b5 = 3 (meV)-1, which is also comparable to the\nnoise measurement. This evidence suggests that the\nfluctuation of tunneling rate originates from the\nfluctuation of the barrier potential. Therefore, the 1/f\ncurrent noise can be understood as the fluctuation of the\nconfinement potential around the QD.\nThe standard 1/f noise model assumes that electronic\ntraps are uniformly distributed in the device.[7,8] If each\ntrap has its own activation energy and the electron\noccupation thermally fluctuates, the power spectrum of the\ncharge fluctuation on a trap is a Lorentzian. By assuming\nthat the activation energy is also uniformly distributed in\nthe range of interest, the ensemble power spectrum of\ncharge fluctuation becomes a 1/f spectrum given by\n\nSq \u221d\n\nkT .\nf\n\nfluctuation \u2206I is almost independent of temperature in the\nmeasurement range [See Fig. 3(a)]. However, \u2206I contains\nthe temperature dependence of the device characteristics,\nwhich are not included in Eq. 2. The derivative |dI/dVL|\ndecreases with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig.\n3(b). At higher temperature (> 100 mK), this can be\nexplained by the Fermi distribution of electrons in the\nelectrodes. The dashed line shows the expected\ntemperature dependence, \u03b1I0/4kBT, where I0 = 23 pA is the\nsaturation current. At low temperature, |dI/dVL| may be\nlimited by the lifetime broadening or the effective electron\ntemperature (~ 100 mK). Nevertheless, the current\nbecomes more sensitive to the potential fluctuation at\nlower temperature. So we evaluated the potential\nfluctuation in order to disregard the device characteristics.\nAs shown in Fig. 3(c), the power of the estimated potential\nfluctuation (\u2206\u03b5)2 has almost linear temperature\ndependence. Therefore, the simple 1/f noise model is still\nvalid for QD devices at low temperature.\nNext, we discuss the influence of the energy relaxation\non the background charge fluctuation. When a large VDS is\napplied, electrons lose their energy somewhere in the\ndevice. No influence is expected if the energy relaxation\noccurs very far from the QD. However, 1/f noise may be\nenhanced if the energy relaxation takes place near or\ninside the QD. The energy transfer from conducting\nelectrons to the electron traps has been discussed for a\ncurrent noise in a metallic SET, but the experimental result\nwas inconclusive.[15] We investigate this effect in the\nnonlinear transport regime, where energy relaxation\nprocess can be controlled by external voltages.\n\n(a)\n0.04\n(\u2206\u03b5)2 [(\u03bceV)2]\n\n\u2206I (fA)\n(\u2206\u03b5)2 [(\u03bceV)2] |dI/dVL| (nA/V)\n\nVDS = 70 \u03bcV\n\n(a)\n\n200\n\n0.03\n\nE2,0\n\nT = 20mK\nE4,0\n\nE1,0\n\n0.02\n\nE0,1\n\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n(2)\n\nThis simple model explains the 1/f frequency dependence,\nand also indicates that the noise power is proportional to\nthe temperature.[12] However, the power of the current\nnoise usually does not follow the linear temperature\ndependence.15 We tested how well this model applies to\nthe potential fluctuation in our device.\nThe temperature dependence of \u2206I, |dI/dVL| and (\u2206\u03b5)2 is\nsummarized in Fig. 3. A relatively small voltage VDS = 70\n\u03bcV was applied to minimize the influence from the\nexcited states. Data represented by open (solid) circles\nwere obtained at \u03bcd = \u03b50, 0 (\u03bcs= \u03b50, 0).

(b) Energy diagram of single-electron transport\nat \u03bcd = \u03b50,0. (c) Energy diagram at \u03bcs = \u03b50,0.\n\n\fWe focus on the positive VDS region, 70 \u03bceV < VDS <\n600 \u03bceV, where a couple of excited states are involved in\nthe transport. Figure 4(a) shows the VDS dependence of the\npower of the potential fluctuation (\u2206\u03b5)2 obtained at \u03bcs =\n\u03b50,0 and \u03bcd = \u03b50,0. The fluctuation slightly increases with\nVDS, but the change is very small compared to the\ntemperature dependence. At \u03bcd = \u03b50,0, i-th excited states of\nthe (N+1) electron QD can be occupied at a large\nexcitation voltage, eVDS > Ei,0 = \u03b5i,0 - \u03b50,0, as shown by the\narrow in the energy diagram of Fig. 4(b). Similarly, j-th\nexcited states of the N electron QD can be occupied at\neVDS > E0,j = \u03b50,0 - \u03b50,j [See Fig. 4(c)]. The energy spacing\nEi,0 and E0,j, obtained from conventional excitation spectra,\nseem to coincide with the excitation voltages at which the\npotential fluctuation changes slightly, as indicated by\nvertical lines in Fig. 4(a). Since no substantial change is\nobserved unless the QD is excited (See open circles for\nVDS < 400 \u03bcV), energy relaxation outside the QD does not\ncause significant charge fluctuation. In contrast, energy\nrelaxation inside the QD may have influenced the\nbackground charge fluctuation. Energy relaxation from the\nexcited state to the ground state accompanies a phonon\nemission, which might influence the charge distributions\nnear the dot. However, further studies are required in order\nto clarify the energy transfer mechanism. Since\nmonochromatic phonons are generated locally from a QD\nby the single-electron tunneling process, interaction with a\nspecific trap may involve some interesting physics.\nIn practice, the magnitude of the potential fluctuation\nstrongly depends on samples, even though they are\nfabricated in the same batch. The magnitude also depends\non the gate voltages in a sample, indicating a large spatial\ndistribution of trap density. A specific peak with relatively\nsmall fluctuations was investigated here. Minimizing trap\ndensity will require further study.\nIn summary, we have investigated 1/f noise in a tunneling\ncurrent through a GaAs QD. The current noise can be\nunderstood as a fluctuation of the confinement potential\nand tunneling barrier. Our results indicate that the\npotential fluctuation decreases with decreasing\ntemperature, although the current noise may not be\ndecreased.\nThis work was partially supported by BK 21 of Korea.\n1.
