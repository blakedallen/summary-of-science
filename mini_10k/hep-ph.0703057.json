Actually\nall the other sectors in the standard model of particle physics (SM) other than the Higgs\nsector have been experimentally well tested but the SM still has been regarded unnatural\nsince the mass of the Higgs boson is quadratically sensitive to the cutoff scale (\u223c \u039bcut ) which\nis supposed to be hierarchically larger than the weak scale (\u223c MW ).\nUp to date, the low energy supersymmetry or its minimal realization (MSSM) accommodating the SM in its particle spectrum might have been regarded as the best motivated and\nsuccessful example of a natural theory of EWSB. Even better, with the exact conservation\nof a discrete symmetry, dubbed R-parity, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the\nMSSM can be a nice candidate of dark matter. The LSP (often the lightest neutralino (\u03c7\u030310 ))\nappears in cascade decays of a super-particles but easily escapes the particle detectors thus\nthe frequent appearance of missing energy signals can be thought as a genuine feature of the\nMSSM with R-parity. Very interestingly, this feature (the existence of a global symmetry\nand the stability of the lightest particle in the newly extended sector) is shared by recently\nsuggested models beyond the SM. Among others, we are mainly interested in little Higgs\ntheories [1, 2](for reviews, see [3, 4].) with a parity, dubbed T-parity (LHT), by which the\nlightest new particle, a heavy photon (AH ) , is absolutely stable and any new particles in\nthe extended sector beyond the SM can be produced only by a pair. Single production of\nthe new particle is prohibited by the T-parity just like the R-parity in the MSSM.\nIn LHT, the Higgs field is a Pseudo-Goldstone boson. Higgs as a Goldstone boson has\nbeen considered since long time ago but its natural realization in the light of collective\nsymmetry breaking was suggested quite recently. Once the Higgs mass is protected by\nseveral symmetries, as was the case in the little Higgs theories by construction, no one-loop\nquadratic mass could be induced. However the original formulation of little Higgs theories\nare severely constrained by electroweak precision data [5, 6, 7]. This mainly came from\nthe fact that the newly introduced particles (m \u223c f ) in the extended gauge and fermion\nsectors could directly mix with the standard model particles at the tree level without suitable\nsymmetry protection. The most economic and elegant way out, up to date, is to introduce\n2\n\n\fT-parity, in the theory and assign the most of new particles odd and the standard model\nparticles even under the parity [8, 9, 10]. By doing so, no tree level mixing is allowed and\nelectroweak constraints are greatly relieved [11]:\nf & 500GeV.\n\n(1)\n\nOnce T-parity is introduced, the phenomenology of little Higgs models could be essentially\nsimilar to the low energy supersymmetry with R-parity [12]. The lightest T-odd particle\ncannot further decay to the single standard model particle similarly to the lightest neutralino\n\u03c7\u030310 in supersymmetric models. Because of this similarity, little Higgs models can \"fake\" the\nsupersymmetric signals at the near future colliders, such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). Future linear colliders, such as ILC and TESLA, could help to provide valuable\ndistinctions between MSSM and the other models, e.g., LHT. That's the main motivation\nof this study.\nMore specifically, we would concentrate on the phenomenology of T-odd, new top quark\n(T) which is the lightest among all the newly introduced fermions, in most realization of\nlittle Higgs models with T-parity. The decay signal of T-quark (T \u2192 tAH ) can fake the\n\nsignal of the scalar top quark (t\u0303 \u2192 t\u03c7\u030310 ). Note that provided the mass of the scalar top is\nheavy enough (mt\u0303 > mt + m\u03c7\u030310 ), scalar top can dominantly decay to the standard model top\nquark and the neutralino.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we setup the model of little Higgs with Tparity. The mass and the gauge couplings of T-quark are specified and the relevant Feynman\nrules are derived. In Sec.III, we study the T-quark pair production by electron-positron\ncollision (e\u2212 e+ \u2192 T T\u0304 ). We first calculate the total cross section of T-quark production and\ncompare it with the one of the scalar top pair production when their masses are set to be the\nsame. The angular distributions for produced leptons taking the cascade decay of top quark\nis found to give a clear distinction between the cases with T-quark (fermion) in LHT and\nscalar top quark in the MSSM. The use of the polarization of initial electron and positron\nis also discussed. Summary will be given in the last section.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nSET-UP: TOP QUARK SECTOR OF LHT\n\nIn this section, we will set up the top quark sector of little Higgs model with T-parity.\nWe restrict ourselves to the SU(5)/SO(5) realization of little Higgs mechanism to be specific\n[2]. There have been lots of phenomenological studies of the littlest Higgs models without\n[13, 14, 15, 16] and with T-parity [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].\nTo cancel out the 1-loop contribution of the standard model top quark, the Yukawa\nsector of the third generation need to be extended. To incorporate the collective symmetry\nbreaking pattern, the third generation quarks should be elevated to the complete SU(3)\nrepresentations:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\nq\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\nQ1 = \uf8ec T1 \uf8f7 , Q2 = \uf8ec T2 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nq2\n0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere q1 \u223c 21/30 \u00d712/15 , q2 \u223c 12/15 \u00d721/30 are doubles under [SU(2)\u00d7U(1)]1 \u00d7[SU(2)\u00d7U(1)]2\ngauge symmetry of SU(5) subgroup and T1 \u223c 18/15 \u00d712/15 and T2 \u223c 12/15 \u00d718/15 are singlets.\nUnder T-parity operation, Q1 \u2192 \u2212\u03a30 Q2 where \u03a30 is the vev of an SU(5) symmetric tensor\nby which SU(5) global symmetry is broken down to SO(5) at the energy scale \u223c f . On top\nof the standard model top quark, there are new T-even and T-odd quarks:\n1\nT\u00b1 = \u221a (T1 \u2213 T2 ) ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nand their masses are\nMT+ =\n\nq\n\u03bb21 + \u03bb22 f, MT\u2212 = \u03bb2 f ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bbi \u2243 1 parameters are introduced to give the Yukawa couplings. We can immediately\nnotice that T-odd quark is always lighter than T-even quark and its production would be\nimportant at the near future colliders. The mass of standard model top quark is given by\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 v\nMt = p 2\n,\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb22\n\n(5)\n\nwhere v \u2243 246GeV is the measured vacuum expectation value of the Higgs. The gauge\ninteraction with Z boson and photon (\u03b3) are immediately read out. Because T's are SU(2)\nsinglets, there is no coupling with W boson.\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\ng 2 \u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\nT\u2212 .\nL = T\u0304\u2212 \u03b3\u03bc eA \u2212 sw Z\n3\ncw\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fFIG. 1: The masses of T-even quark (black, dotted) and T-odd quark (blue, solid) for given (a)\nf = 500 GeV and (b) MtSM = 173 GeV.

In (b), \u03bb1 is determined assuming MtSM = 173 GeV.\n\nT-odd quark (T\u2212 ) could decay to the standard model top quark and newly introduced\nneutral gauge bosons, ZH or AH through\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\nv\nv2\n2g \u2032 c\u03bb\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nt,\n\u03b3\u03bc (PR + c\u03bb PL )AH + xh 2 PR ZH\nL = T\u0304\u2212 \u2212\n5\nf\nf\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the mixing parameters c\u03bb and xh are defined as [12]:\n\u03bb1\n,\nc\u03bb \u2261 p 2\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb22\n5gg \u2032\nxh \u2261\n.\n4(5g 2 \u2212 g \u20322)\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nSince ZH acquires heavy mass (MZ2H = g 2(f 2 \u2212 v 2 /4)) but the other one AH does not,\n\n(MA2 H = g \u20322 (f 2 /5\u2212v 2 /4) \u2243 0.162 f 2 ), T\u2212 \u2192 tAH dominates the decay or BR(T\u2212 \u2192 tAH ) \u2243 1\n\nis a good approximation.\nWe show the masses of T-odd and T-even particles in Fig. 1. We fix f = 500 GeV and\nMtSM = 173 GeV in Fig. 1(a). Then the mass of the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) is MAH =\n67 GeV.

Black\ndotted lines represent the masses for the T-even partners for MTeven = 300, 500, 1000, 1500\nGeV. However \u03bb1 is not an independent parameter if we assume top quark mass.

Note that precision electroweak\nconstraints on this model consistently allows values for f as low as 500 GeV without fine\ntuning [12].\nWe would add some comments about possible signals of T-even top partner at the ILC\nand LHC. At the LHC, a single production of the T-even top partner and a quark-jet is\npossible through T-channel exchange diagram of W-boson [14, 15]. Unfortunately the same\nproduction mechanism does not work at the ILC because the T-even top partner does not\ndirectly couple with electron and W-boson. There remains a possibility that T-even top\npartners to be produced by pair through S-channel photon and Z-boson exchange diagrams.\nBut it is highly suppressed or disallowed by kinematics in most of parameter space we are\nconsidering. For details, see the Appendix-C. Considering all these issues, we would like to\nconcentrate on phenomenology of T-parity odd partners (T\u2212 ). It is also fair to assume that\nthe top partner is odd under a discrete symmetry since we plan to compare with stop in\nSUSY. We will use a study point, \u03bb2 = 0.8 and f = 500 GeV, for which pair production of\n\u221a\nT-even partners is not allowed at ILC with s = 1TeV. Our analysis can be also applied to\nfermionic partner of top in any models with a discrete symmetry such as KK-top in UED\nmodel.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nT-ODD TOP PAIR PRODUCTION AT LC\nProduction and decay\n\nThe top quark pair production mechanisms (with or without the missing energy) in the\nSM, LHT and MSSM are depicted in Fig. 2,\n6\n\n\fb\n\ne\u2212\nt\n\ne\u2212\nT\n\nj\u2032\n\n\u03b3, Z\n\nb\nb\u0304\n\n\u03bd\u0304l\n\nt\u0304\n\nT\u0304\n\n\u03bd\u0304l\nb\u0304\n\nj\u2032\n\nt\n\nb\u0304\n\nW\u2212\n\ne+\n\nt\u0303\n\u03b3, Z\n\nb\n\nW\u2212\n\ne+\n\nAH\n\nj\n\nW+\n\nj\u2032\n\nt\n\nl\u2212\nt\u0304\n\ne\u2212\n\nW+\n\nW+\n\n\u03b3, Z\n\n\u03c7\u030310\n\nj\n\nAH\n\nj\n\nt\u0303\u2217\n\n\u03bd\u0304l\n\nt\u0304\n\ne+\nl\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\u03c7\u030310\n\nl\u2212\n\nFIG. 2: Feynman diagrams for pair productions of top quark in the SM, T-odd quarks/scalar top\nquarks and their subsequent decay to tAH /t\u03c7\u030301 in LHT and MSSM, respectively.

The\ncross term is negligible (smaller by two order of magnitude). The cross section is calculated\nwith CalcHEP [29] and cross-checked with MadGraph/MadEvent [30, 31]. One important\npoint we should notice here is that because T-quark is a vector-like fermion, GLL = GLR\nand GRR = GRL :\n(\u2212e)( 32 e) gL gZT T\u0304\n+\n,\ns\ns \u2212 MZ2\n(\u2212e)( 32 e) gR gZT T\u0304\n+\n.\n=\ns\ns \u2212 MZ2\n\nGLL = GLR =\n\n(17)\n\nGRR = GRL\n\n(18)\n\n7\n\n\fHere gL and gR are the couplings between Z and e+ e\u2212 given as gL/R =\n\ne\nsW cW\n\nI3 \u2212 Qe s2W\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere I3 = \u2212 21 is the third component of weak iso-spin of the left-chiral electron, Qe = \u22121 its\ng 2\nsW . As a consequence,\ncharge and the coupling between Z and T T\u0304 is given as gZT T\u0304 = \u2212 32 cW\n\nwe get a simple relation between A, B and C:\n1\nA = B = C.\n2\n\n(19)\n\nWhat can we learn from this observation? First of all, as is explicitly shown in the Appendix,\nthe forward-backward asymmetry vanishes. This is actually a generic feature of a vector-like\nfermion. Based on the precise measurement on AF B asymmetry, one will be able to clearly\nprove that the produced T-quark is a vector-like fermion even though its direct measurement\nmight be challenging. Furthermore, the Left-Right asymmetry, ALR can provide a useful\ninformation about the couplings between T-quark and vector bosons \u03b3 and Z (see Appendix).\nIn Fig. 3(a), we show the pair production cross section of T-odd partner as a function of\nf at a 1 TeV linear collider for various values of \u03bb2 . As we mentioned earlier, photon dominantly contributes to total cross section. However, Z contribution also becomes important\nwhen polarized beams are used and Fig. 3(b) shows production cross section with polarized\nbeams for f = 500 GeV and \u03bb2 = 0.8 (MTodd = 400 GeV). Polarized beams may be used to\nconfirm the nature of T-odd partner by measuring cross sections with different polarizations\nof the beams. As \u03bb2 increases, the corresponding cross section decreases since the mass of\nT-odd partner is proportional to \u03bb2 . The pair production of T-odd partner with f \u2265 700\nGeV at such a collider is not allowed as shown in Fig. 1(b). Solid lines represent cross section\nwithout the initial state radiation (ISR) while the dotted lines are ISR corrected.

We\n\u221a\ntake ISR scale, Q = s. We find that in our study the beamstrahlung effect (for the small\nbeamstrahlung parameter) in the cross sections and the contribution from \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 T T\u0304 ) are\nsmall enough to ignore (See [34, 35] for the beamstrahlung effect at the high energy linear\ncolliders such as CLIC). In Fig. 3(a), we can notice that the inclusion of ISR gives smaller\n\ncross sections (except for \u03bb2 = 0.7) since the beam loses its energy. However for the case of\nthe light T-odd partner (i.e., \u03bb2 \u223c 0.7 and f < 500 GeV), the ISR increases cross sections\nsince the energy loss of the beam results\ncloser to the pair production threshold\nq in getting\n4MT2\nwhich behaves as \u03c3LH \u223c \u03b2 where \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 sodd . In the case of pair production of scalar\n\npartners (i.e., stop), the threshold rises as \u03c3SU SY \u223c \u03b2 3 . The production of fermion (T-odd\npartner) and the production of scalar (stop) have different behavior near the threshold as\nshown in Fig. 4. It is well known that in the massless limit of new particles, the cross section\n9\n\n\fFIG. 4: Pair production cross section in LHT (blue) and SUSY (red) near the threshold\n\nratio converges to a factor of 4 due to the fact that there are two different helicity states\nin LH while in SUSY, stop is a scalar particle [36, 37, 38]. Fermions prefer the forward or\nbackward direction when they are produced at e+ e\u2212 collider,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03c3\n\u223c 2(1 + cos2 \u03b8) ,\nd cos \u03b8 LH\nwhile scalar particles are produced more in the central region,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03c3\n\u223c (1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8) .\nd cos \u03b8 SU SY\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nThese particles go through further decays and we consider semi-leptonic decay of SM top.\nWe assume that we know the mass and momentum of W and t from two jets and one bjet. Fig. 5 shows angular distributions in LH and MSSM in the semi-leptonic channel. The\ndistribution for MSSM is similar to the angular distribution of the scalar production. We see\nclear difference between two distributions. When top partners are produced, T-odd fermions\nprefer forward or backward direction while stops are mainly produced in the central region,\nas explained above. There is no forward-backward asymmetry at this production level. Now\nthey continue to decay into to SM top to W\u03bc and b. As noticed in [41], in the case of SM top\npair production at LC, the forward-backward asymmetry appears due to huge interference\nbetween \u03b3 and Z (negative in backward and positive in forward region), although there is no\nFB asymmetry at all in \u03b3-mediation and small FB asymmetry appears in the Z-mediation.\n10\n\n\fFIG. 5: The angular distribution of final state lepton (l\u2212 ) for LHT and MSSM, respectively. In\nLHT, leptons follow the angular distribution of the parent T-odd quarks and highly anisotropic.\nHowever in MSSM, mainly because of the characteristics of scalar particle production, the angular\ndistribution is roughly (1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8). (PYTHIA [40] also gives similar distribution in the case of\nMSSM.)\n\nThis characteristic feature is carried in the decay of T-odd and the angular distribution of\ntop at LC in the production just looks like angular distribution of the lepton in the case\nof LH. However, in the case of SUSY, the angular distribution is not spoiled as much as\nLH case since they are produced in the central region. (See [25, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46] for the\ndiscrimination between SUSY and other new physics such as UED/LH at the LHC in a\nparticular cascade decay. These studies seem to either require large luminosity or depend\non certain assumptions.)\n\nB.\n\nBackgrounds\n\nWe list possible backgrounds for our signal in Table III B. The dominant backgrounds are\ntt\u0304 and \u03bde e+ W \u2212 Z. tt\u0304 can be easily distinguished from our signal in the energy distribution\nof SM top since Etop =\n\n\u221a\n\ns\n2\n\nin SM while LHT or SUSY shows a flat distribution over wide\n\nrange of Etop as shown in Fig. 6. In fact, the upper edge (E+ ) is always less than Etop =\n\n\u221a\n\ns\n2\n\nand signal is well separated from this background. A background tt\u0304Z is included when tt\u0304\u03bd \u03bd\u0304\nis estimated.

These backgrounds are also ignored in\nsupersymmetric case (see [47] for details) with similar reasons. However our case is even\n\nbetter since the pair production cross section of two fermions (T-odd) is much larger than\nthe pair production cross section of two scalars (stop), as discussed in the previous section.\nWith the signal cross section and the expected ILC luminosity L = 500 or 1000 fb\u22121 , we can\neasily get large number events even if we lose some of events by imposing cuts to remove\nSM backgrounds. Therefore we can safely ignore backgrounds in our study.\n\nC.\n\nEnergy distribution of reconstructed top\n\nIn the hadronic (semi-leptonic channel), we can reconstruct momenta of two (one) top\nquarks and look at the energy distribution of top.

The statistical uncertainties in the measurement of Ab is even better in the LHT\nsince the production cross section is much larger than one in SUSY for given masses (see [47]\nfor detail.).\n\n15\n\n\fIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we studied the phenomenology of top partners in the context of the MSSM\nand LHT. In the MSSM, a discrete symmetry, R-parity, is introduced and the lightest superparticle is automatically stable. Its characteristic missing energy signals has been regarded\nas a genuine feature of the theory. Exactly the same signature can happen in the LHT where\na discrete symmetry, dubbed T-parity, can play similar roles with those of the R-parity in\nthe MSSM. Since the collider signals of both theories can mimic each other's, one need to\ncompare their phenomenology precisely to understand the underlying physics.\nWe first estimated the total cross section of the pair production of top partners (the\nlightest scalar top quark in the MSSM and the T-odd top quark partner in the LHT) in\nthe near future linear colliders where we can have better resolution for various observable\nquantities than that of the LHC and better chance to discriminate the \"fake\" theories. The\nlarger cross section is expected for T-odd quark production than scalar top quark production\nonce their masses are set to be exactly the same since T-odd quark has 2 times larger number\nof helicity degrees of freedom than that of scalar top quark (see Fig.4). Also the angular\ndistributions for T-odd quark (or its leptonic decay products) can be distinguishable from\nthat of scalar top quark, again thanks to its fermionic characteristics (see Fig.5.). The\nstandard model background was also estimated and we found that it is quite plausible for\nus to be able to distinguish the signals of LHT and MSSM from the ones of the standard\nmodel. We provide the analytic expressions for reconstruction of Top-partner's mass in\nthe LHT and MSSM in the hadronic or semi-leptonic channel. The energy distribution\nof top quark (see Fig. 6) can be a useful observable quantity for study of top partners.\nThe angular distribution of b-jet in the final state was studied since it can provide an\nimportant understanding about the helicity of the top-partner (see Fig.7). In the appendix,\nwe presented asymmetries for the LHT (ALR and AF B ). They are found to be useful to\nunderstand the 'vectorlikeness' of the T-odd quark in the LHT using asymmetries.\nIn conclusion, linear collider experiments with the better resolution than that of hadronic\ncollider experiments can provide a nice chance to probe and discriminate the competing\ntheories beyond the standard model such as the LHT and MSSM which share similar phenomenological features.\n\n16\n\n\fFIG. 8: (a) The left-right asymmetry for polarized scattering and (b) the forward-backward asymmetry. Here we think of more generic case where the vector-like condition or (GLL = GLR and\nGRR = GRL ) does not apply.
