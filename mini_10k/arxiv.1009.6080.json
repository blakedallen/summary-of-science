There has been considerable progress during recent years in the experimental\nstudies. Experimental evidence for the statistical property of nuclear fragmentation has\nbeen given [1\u20133] and various new quantities have been measured [1\u20134]. These quantities\ninclude the mean multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments (< NIM F >), the average\ncharge of the largest fragment (Zmax ), the sum of all charges with Z \u2265 2 etc.\n\nThe\n\nquantity which is intimately related to the multifragmentation process is the multiplicity of\nintermediate mass fragments. Correlation between mean multiplicity of IMF's, < NIM F >,\nand the mass of the fragmenting system, whose measure is so called bound charge Zbound is\nan important aspect of multifragmentation that has been studied thoroughly by a number\nof groups [2, 4, 5]. They, however, didnot take asymmetry of the system into account which\nis very important to study the isospin effects [6, 7]. The asymmetry of the reaction can be\ndefined by the parameter \u03b7 = | (AT \u2212 AP )/(AT + AP ) |; where AT and AP are the masses\nof target and projectile. The \u03b7 = 0 corresponds to the symmetric reactions, whereas,\nnon-zero value of \u03b7 define different asymmetry of the reaction. It is worth mentioning that\nthe reaction dynamics in a symmetric reaction (\u03b7 = 0) can be quite different compared\nto asymmetric reaction (\u03b7 6= 0) [8]. This is due to the deposition of excitation energy\nin the form of compressional energy and thermal energy in symmetric and asymmetric\nreactions, respectively. The multifragmentation is studied many times in the literature\n[6, 7]. Unfortunately, very little study is available for the mass asymmetry of the reaction\nin terms of multifragmentation.\nIn recent years, it has become possible to do exclusive measurements of multifragmentation\n\n2\n\n\fprocess. This has been done with streamer chamber detectors, electronic detectors, and\n4\u03c0 detectors. ALADiN [2, 4, 5] group has reported that the mean multiplicity of IMF's\n< NIM F > was found to be same for all targets ranging from Beryllium to Lead and for\nE/A ranging from 400 to 1000 MeV/nucleon. De Souza et al., [9] observed a linear increase\nin the multifragmentation of IMF's for central collisions with incident energies varying\nbetween 35 and 110 MeV/nucleon. In 2009, Tsang et al., [10] reported a rise and fall in\nthe production of IMF's. The maximal value of the IMF's shifts from nearly central to\nperipheral collisions with the increase in the incident energy.\nTheoretically, multifragmentation can be studied by statistical [11] as well as dynamical\nmodels [12]. The universal property of multifragmentation has been quite satisfactorily\ndescribed by the statistical multifragmentation models [11]. On the other hand, dynamical\nmodels are very useful for studying the reaction from the initial state to the final state\nwhere matter is fragmented and cold. In this paper, we will adress the most interesting\ndependence of the multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments (IMF's). This multiplicity is\nestimated in terms of the \"bound\" charge value. We have used Isospin-dependent quantum\nmolecular (IQMD) model to study the effect of asymmetry of colliding nuclei on the\nmultifragmentation.\n\nThe isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD)[13] model treats different\ncharge states of nucleons, deltas and pions explicitly [14], as inherited from the VlasovUehling-Uhlenbeck (VUU) model [15]. The details about the elastic and inelastic cross\nsections for proton-proton and neutron-neutron collisions can be found in Refs.[13, 16].\nIn this model, baryons are represented by Gaussian-shaped density distributions\n\nfi (r, p, t) =\n\n2 .2L\n1 \u2212(r\u2212ri (t))2 \u2212(p\u2212pi (t))\n2L\n~2\ne\n.\ne\n\u03c0 2 ~2\n\n(1)\n\nNucleons are initialized in a sphere with radius R = 1.12A1/3 fm, in accordance with the\nliquid drop model. Each nucleon occupies a volume of ~3 so that phase space is uniformly\n3\n\n\ffilled. The initial momenta are randomly chosen between 0 and Fermi momentum pF .\nThe nucleons of the target and projectile interact via two and three-body Skyrme forces\nand Yukawa potential. The isospin degrees of freedom is treated explicitly by employing\na symmetry potential and explicit Coulomb forces between protons of the colliding target\nand projectile. This helps in achieving the correct distribution of protons and neutrons\nwithin the nucleus.\nThe hadrons propagate using Hamilton equations of motion:\nd~\nri\nd<H>\n=\ndt\ndpi\n\n;\n\nd~\npi\nd<H>\n.\n=\u2212\ndt\ndri\n\n(2)\n\nwith\n< H >=< T > + < V > is the Hamiltonian.\nXXZ\nX p2\ni\n+\nfi (~r, ~p, t)V ij (r~\u2032 , ~r)\n=\n2m\ni\ni j>i\ni\n\u00d7fj (r~\u2032 , p~\u2032 , t)d~rdr~\u2032d~pdp~\u2032 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe baryon-baryon potential V ij , in the above relation, reads as\n\nV ij (r~\u2032 \u2212 ~r)\n\n=\n=\n+\n+\n\nij\nij\nij\nVSkyrme\n+ VYijukawa + VCoul\n+ VSym\nr~\u2032 + ~r\nt1 \u03b4(r~\u2032 \u2212 ~r) + t2 \u03b4(r~\u2032 \u2212 ~r)\u03c1\u03b3\u22121 (\n)\n2\nZi Zj e2\nexp(| r~\u2032 \u2212 ~r |/\u03bc)\n+\nt3\n(| r~\u2032 \u2212 ~r |/\u03bc)\n| r~\u2032 \u2212 ~r |\n1\nt4 T3i T3j .\u03b4(r~i\u2032 \u2212 r~j ).\n\u03c1o\n\n(4)\n\nWhere \u03bc = 0.4f m, t3 = \u22126.66MeV and t4 = 100MeV .

The parameters \u03bc and t1 , ........, t4 are adjusted to the real part of the nucleonic\noptical potential. For the density dependence of the nucleon optical potential, standard\n4\n\n\fSkyrme-type parameterizations is employed.\n\nThe Yukawa term is quite similar to the\n\nsurface energy coefficient used in the calculations of nuclear potential for fusion [17]. The\nbinary nucleon-nucleon collisions are included by employing collision term of well known\nVUU- Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) equation [15, 18]. The binary collisions are\nallowed stochastically, in a similar way as are done in all transport models. During the\npropagation, two nucleons are supposed to suffer a binary collision if the distance between\ntheir centroids\n\n| ri \u2212 rj | \u2264\n\nr\n\n\u221a\n\u03c3tot = \u03c3( s, type),\n\n\u03c3tot\n,\n\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\n\"type\" denotes the ingoing collision partners (N-N, N-\u03b4, N-\u03c0...). In addition, Pauli blocking\n(of the final state) of baryons is taken into account by checking the phase space densities\nin the final states. The final phase space fractions P1 and P2 which are already occupied\nby other nucleons, are determined for each of the scattering baryons. The collision is then\nblocked with probability\n\nPblock = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 P1 )(1 \u2212 P2 ).\nII.\n\n(6)\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn the present calculations, a simple spatial clusterization algorithm dubbed as the\nminimum spanning tree (MST) method is used to clusterize the phase space [19], which is\ngenerated by IQMD Model. We however, also acknowledge that more microscopic algorithm\nroutines are also available in the literature [13]. By using the asymmetric (colliding) nuclei,\nthe effect of mass asymmetry can be analyzed without varying the total mass of the system.\nWe have fixed (AT OT = AT + AP = 152) and varied the asymmetry of the reaction just\nlike this:\n16 S\n\n32\n\n56\n26 F e\n\n+44 Ru96 (\u03b7 = 0.2),\n\n+50 Sn120 (\u03b7 = 0.5),\n\n28\n14 Si\n\n24 Cr\n\n50\n\n+44 Ru102 (\u03b7 = 0.3),\n\n40\n20 Ca\n\n+50 Sn112 (\u03b7 = 0.4),\n\n+54 Xe124 (\u03b7 = 0.6), 8 O 16 +54 Xe136 (\u03b7 = 0.7).\n\n5\n\n\f3.0\n\nE\n= 250 MeV/nucl.\nc.m.\n\n2.5\n\nb\n\n= 0.3\n\nIMF\n\n2.0\n\nN\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n= 0.2\n= 0.3\n\n0.5\n\n= 0.4\n0.0\n30\n\n= 0.5\n= 0.6\n\n25\n\nbound\n\n= 0.7\n\nZ\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nTime (fm/c)\n\nFIG. 1: Mean multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments as a function of Zbound at Ec.m. = 250\nMeV/nucleon for soft equation of state. Different lines represent the different asymmetries varying\nfrom 0.2 to 0.7. Here, the values of Zbound are recorded at different time steps.\n\nDue to the repulsive nature of Coulomb interactions, one is not able to know the exact\nnature of asymmetry in the reaction dynamics. To understand the role of asymmetry\nbeyond the Coulomb effects, we switch off the Coulomb force in our analysis. Additionaly,\nwe keep the center-of-mass energy fixed throughout the analysis.\nIn order to study the correlation between the < NIM F > and Zbound , it is necessary to\nunderstand the time evolution of intermediate mass fragments as well as Zbound , which is\nshown in Fig. 1. One learns from this figure that the mean multiplicity of IMF increases first\nwith the increase of time and then attains equilibrium at later times. The system having\nleast asymmetry gives rise to more IMF's as compared to system having large asymmetry.\nThis might be due to the reason that as one move towards the large asymmetries, then size\nof the fragments becomes larger than the size of IMFs and hence decrease in multiplicity of\n6\n\n\f2.5\nZ\n\nbound\n\n2.0\n\n= 16\n\nm = -1.7\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n3.0\n\nZ\n\n2.5\n\nbound\n\n= 20\n\nm = -2.7\n\nN\n\nIMF\n\n2.0\n1.5\n\nE\n\nc.m.\n\n= 250 MeV/nucl.\n\n1.0\n2.0\n\nZ\n\n1.5\n\nbound\n\n= 27\n\nm = -2.6\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nAT\nAT\n\n0.5\n\nAP\nAP\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nFIG. 2: Mean multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments as a function of asymmetry parameter\n\u03b7 at different Zbound values at Ec.m. = 250 MeV/nucleon for soft equation of state.

On the other hand, one can see that there is a continious decrease in\nthe value of Zbound with time This is due to the decay of compound nucleus into lighter\nparticles (i.e free nucleons, LCPs etc.). It means the system is still in non-equilibrium\nstate. Moreover, the highly asymmetric system produces largest Zbound because in such a\ncase most of the part goes uninteracted.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the variation of mean multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments with\nthe asymmetry of the system at different values of Zbound . The < NIM F > decreases with\nthe increase in asymmetry of the system. This is true for lighter as well as heavier values\nof Zbound . The lines are fitted with equation y = mx + c where, y = NIM F , x = \u03b7, and m\nis slope of the line. The slope values are -1.7, -2.7. -2.6 corresponding to Zbound = 16, 20,\n27, respectively.

Moreover,\nmaximum IMF's are produced at Zbound = 20, indicating the limit of IMFs for a system\nhaving A = 152.\nExperimentalists studied many times the Zbound dependence of NIM F for symmetric\n[5] as well as asymmetric systems. Following these attempts, the detailed analysis with\nasymmetry of the reaction is performed in Fig. 3, where we have plotted the impact\nparameter dependence of NIM F (top panel), Zbound (medium panel), and finally NIM F\nversus Zbound (bottom panel). Due to the low excitation energy E = 250 MeV/nucleon,\ncentral collisions generate repulsion in a manner so that the colliding nuclei breakup into\n8\n\n\fIMFs, whereas for the peripheral collisions, the size of the fragment is close to the size of the\nreacting nuclei, and therefore, one sees a very few IMFs. Interestingly, a rise and fall can be\nseen for nearly symmetric systems, which indicates the possible existence of various decay\nmodes from the evaporation (fission) mode to the multifragmentation mode and then to the\nvaporization mode [20]. Moreover, this behavior is observed to be disappear with increase in\nasymmetry of the reaction. On the other hand, in Fig. 3(b) the Zbound is found to increase\nwith impact parameter of the reaction. As impact parameter increases, participant zone\ndecreases and spectator zone increases, which will lead to the increase in the production of\nheavier fragments and hence increase in the value of Zbound with impact parameter. The\nsymmetric systems are more sensitive with the impact parameter dependence of Zbound as\ncompared to the asymmetric systems. The maximum asymmetry means that from projectile\nor target, one is heaviest one and other is lightest one. This leads to the possibility of IMF's\nproduction even at central collisions. The change in geometry does not alter too much the\nproduction of IMF's in asymmetric systems as compared to symmetric systems. This is\nfurther elaborated in Fig. 3(c). which shows correlation between the NIM F and Zbound by\ntaking into account asymmetry of the reaction (\u03b7 = 0.2 to 0.7). Here, the values of Zbound\nare recorded at different impact parameters varying from central to peripheral one. It was\nshown [2] that Zbound allows a very good determination of the impact parameters and hence\ndifferent reaction geometries. The smaller values of Zbound correspond to more central\ncollisions. Since the IMF's are produced due to target breakup into pieces, therefore, as\nwe vary the asymmetry parameter from \u03b7 = 0.2 to 0.7, the target fragmentation increases.\nThe maximum number of IMF's are observed in the Zbound range from 15 to 20. This is in\nagreement with the findings shown in Fig. 2. At lowest asymmetry, we get a rise and fall\nin the production of IMF's with Zbound . But as the asymmetry increases, the curve shows a\nsteep variation. These findings are supported by the findings of Fig. 3(a). From this, one\ncan see that at highest asymmetry, the size of bounded fragment becomes largest. Therefore\nreaction dynamics changes drastically as one moves from low asymmetry to high asymmetry.\n9\n\n\fIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe present our recent results on the fragmentation by varying the asymmetry of the\nreaction between 0.2 and 0.7 at an incident energy of 250 MeV/nucleon. For the present\nstudy, the total mass of the system is kept constant (AT OT = 152) and asymmetry of the\nreaction is defined by (\u03b7 = | (AT \u2212 AP )/(AT + AP ) |). The measured distributions are given\nas a function of the total charge of all projectile fragments, Zbound . We see an interesting\noutcome for large asymmetric colliding niclei. Although nearly symmetric nuclei depict a\nwell known trend of rising and falling, this trend, however, is completely missing for large\nasymmetric nuclei. In conclusion, experiments are needed to verify this prediction.\n\nIV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work has been supported by the grant from Department of Science and Technology\n(DST), Government of India, vide Grant No.SR/WOS-A/PS-10/2008.\n\nV.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] C.
