We discuss the renormalization\ncondition adopted in this analysis.\n\n\u00a71.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the nontrivial issues in hadron physics is almost complete absence of\nflavor exotic hadrons. Experimentally, we have been observing more than hundred\nof hadrons,1) whose flavor quantum numbers can be expressed by minimal valence\nquark contents of q\u0304q or qqq. The only one exception is the exotic baryon \u0398+ with\nS = +1,2) which is composed of at lease five valence quarks. In this way, the exotic\nhadrons are indeed \"exotic\" as an experimental fact. On the other hand, there is\nno clear theoretical explanation for the nonobservation of the exotic hadrons. Our\ncurrent knowledge does not forbid to construct four or five quark states in QCD and\nin effective models. Moreover, the multiquark components in nonexotic hadrons are\nevident, as seen in the antiquark distribution (or pion cloud) in nucleon and successful\ndescriptions of some excited hadrons as resonances in two-hadron scatterings. In view\nof these facts, it is fair to say that the nonobservation of the exotic hadrons is not\nfully understood theoretically.\n\u00a72.\n\nExotic hadrons in s-wave chiral dynamics\n\nIn chiral coupled-channel dynamics, some hadron resonances have been successfully described in s-wave scattering of a hadron and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG)\nboson,3), 4), 5), 6) along the same line with the old studies with phenomenological vector meson exchange interaction.7), 8) It was found that the generated resonances\nturned into bound states in flavor SU(3) symmetric limit.9) We therefore conjecture\nthat the bound states in the SU(3) limit are the origin of a certain class of physical\nresonances, and we examine the possible existence of exotic hadrons as hadron-NG\nboson bound states.10), 11)\nThe low energy interaction of the NG boson (Ad) with a target hadron (T ) in\n\n\u2217)\n\ne-mail address: hyodo@yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\ntypeset using P T P TEX.cls hVer.0.9i\n\n\f2\n\nT.

The factor C\u03b1,T is\ndetermined by specifying the flavor representations of the target T and the scattering\nsystem \u03b1 \u2208 T \u2297Ad:\nC\u03b1,T = \u2212 h2FT * FAd i\u03b1 = C2 (T ) \u2212 C2 (\u03b1) + 3,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere C2 (R) is the quadratic Casimir of SU(3) for the representation R. Eq. (2.1)\nis the model-independent consequence of chiral symmetry, known as the WeinbergTomozawa theorem.12), 13)\nWe have written down the general expression of the coupling strengths (2.2)\nfor arbitrary representations of target hadrons in SU(3). In order to specify the\nexotic channels, we introduced the exoticness quantum number, as the number of\nvalence antiquarks to construct the given flavor multiplet for the states with positive\nbaryon number. Then we find that the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction in the exotic\nchannels is repulsive in most cases, and that possible strength of the attractive\ninteraction is given by a universal value\nCexotic = 1,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith \u03b1 = [p \u2212 1, 2] for T = [p, 0] and p \u2265 3B.10), 11)\nNext we construct the scattering amplitude with unitarity condition using the\nN/D method.5) The unitarized amplitude is given by\n\u221a\nt\u03b1 ( s) =\n\n\u221a\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a V\u03b1 ( s),\n1 \u2212 V\u03b1 ( s)G( s)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nas a function of the center-of-mass energy s. The loop function G( s) is regularized\nby the once subtraction as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c1(s\u2032 )\n\u03c1(s\u2032 )\n\u2032\nG( s) = \u2212\u00e3(s0 ) \u2212\n\u2212\nds\n,\n(2.4)\n2\u03c0 s+\ns\u2032 \u2212 s s\u2032 \u2212 s0\np\nwhere the phase space integrand is \u03c1(s) = 2MT (s \u2212 s+ )(s \u2212 s\u2212 )/(8\u03c0s), s\u00b1 =\n(m \u00b1 MT )2 , and m and MT are the masses of the target hadron and the NG boson.\nIn order to determine the subtraction constant \u00e3(s0 ) and the subtraction point\ns0 , we adopt the renormalization condition given in Refs. 14), 6),\nG(\u03bc) = 0,\n\n\u03bc = MT ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhich is equivalent to t\u03b1 (\u03bc) = V\u03b1 (\u03bc) at this scale. We will discuss the implication\nof this prescription in section 3. With the condition (2.5), we show that the bound\nstate can be obtained if the coupling strength (2.2) is larger than the critical value\nCcrit =\n\n2f 2\n\u0002\n\u0003.\nm \u2212G(MT + m)\n\n\fExotic hadrons in s-wave chiral dynamics\n\n3\n\nVarying the parameters m, MT , and f in the physically allowed region, we show\nthat the attraction in the exotic channels (2.3) is always smaller than the critical\nvalue Ccrit . Thus, it is not possible to generate bound states in exotic channels in\nthe SU(3) symmetric limit.\nWe would like to emphasize that this conclusion is model independent in the\nSU(3) limit, as far as we respect chiral symmetry. In this study, we only consider\nthe exotic hadrons composed of the NG boson and a hadron, so the existence of\nexotic states generated by quark dynamics or rotational excitations of chiral solitons\nis not excluded. In practice, one should bear in mind that the SU(3) breaking\neffect and higher order terms in the chiral Lagrangian would play a substantial role.\nNevertheless, the study of exotic hadrons in a simple extension of a successful model\nof hadron resonances as we have done in the present work can partly explain difficulty\nof observation of the exotic hadrons.\n\u00a73.\n\nInterpretation of the renormalization condition\n\n.\nHere we discuss\n\u221a the renormalization condition (2 5) in this analysis. The interaction kernel V\u03b1 ( s) is constructed from chiral perturbation theory so as to satisfy\nthe low energy theorem. The low energy theorem also constrains the behavior of the\n\u221a\n\u221a\nfull unitarized amplitude t\u03b1 ( s) at a scale s = \u03bcm where \u221a\nthe chiral expansion is\nvalid. Therefore\nwe can match the unitarized amplitude t\u03b1 ( s) with the tree level\n\u221a\none V\u03b1 ( s) at the scale \u03bcm :\nt\u03b1 (\u03bcm ) = V\u03b1 (\u03bcm ) + V\u03b1 (\u03bcm )G(\u03bcm )V\u03b1 (\u03bcm ) + * * * = V\u03b1 (\u03bcm ),\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis condition determines the subtraction constant such that the loop function\nG(\u03bcm ) vanishes. This is only possible within the region15)\nMT \u2212 m \u2264 \u03bcm \u2264 MT + m,\n\n(3.2)\n\nsince the loop function has an imaginary part outside this region and the subtraction\nconstant is a real number. We consider that by employing this renormalization\ncondition, a natural unitarization of the kernel interaction based on chiral symmetry\nis realized. Interestingly, if we apply this prescription for the case of the octet baryon\ntarget, the subtraction constant turns out to be \"natural size\" which was found in\nthe comparison with three-momentum cutoff,5) and the experimental observables in\nthe S = \u22121 meson-baryon channel are successfully reproduced.\nWe take \u03bcm = MT in the present study. The dependence on \u03bcm within the\nregion (3.2) is found that the binding energy of the bound state increases if we\nshift the matching scale \u03bcm to the lower energy region. This is discussed also in\nRefs. 17),18) by varying the subtraction constant. The region \u03bcm \u2264 MT corresponds\nto the u-channel scattering. Thus \u03bcm = MT is the most favorable to generate a bound\nstate within the s-channel regime.\nThe unitarized amplitudes in the above prescription do not always reproduce experimental data. In such a case, the subtraction constants \u00e3(s0 ) should be adjusted\nin order to satisfy experimental data. The subtraction constants determined in this\n\n\f4\n\nT. Hyodo, D. Jido and A. Hosaka\n\nway supplement the role of the higher order chiral Lagrangians, which is lacking in\nthe kernel interaction. As shown for the \u03c1 meson effect in the meson-meson scattering,16) the higher order terms may contain the effect of the resonances. Therefore,\nif the natural condition (3.1) is badly violated, one may speculate that the seeds\nof resonances in the higher order Lagrangian, which are possibly the genuine quark\nstates, appear in the unitarized amplitude, as in the study of Ref. 19).\nIn summary, we have argued the following issues.\n\u221a\n\u2022 In order for the unitarized amplitude t\u03b1 ( s) to satisfy the low energy theorem,\nthe loop function should vanish in the region (3.2).\n\u2022 This requirement can be regarded as a natural unitarization, without introducing the effect of resonances in the higher order Lagrangian.\n\u2022 Lower matching scale \u03bcm is more favorable to generate a bound state.\nTurning to the problem of exotic hadrons, what we have shown is the nonexistence\nof the exotic bound states with the most favorable condition to generate a bound\nstate, without introducing the seed of genuine quark state.\nAcknowledgements\nT.
