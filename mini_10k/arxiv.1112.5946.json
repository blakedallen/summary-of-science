In the weakbackscattering regime, small gate voltages on the QPCs create constrictions inside\nthe incompressible FQH liquid and facilitate tunneling of non-Abelian quasiparticles along the QPCs. However, this regime is unstable in the sense of the renormalization group flow, i.e., even a small number of quasiparticles tunneling along\nthe QPCs at low T significantly renormalizes the tunneling amplitudes thus intensifying tunneling and eventually the two QPCs pinch off, which corresponds to the\nstrong backscattering regime that is already a stable fixed point of the renormalization group flow.\n\nLachezar S.

The side gates' voltage could change the area of the CB island varying\nin this way the flux through the island.\n\nis determined in the following steps (sequential tunneling through CB island): first\none electron tunnels from the left FQH liquid through the left QPC to the island,\nthen the electron which is accommodated at the edge of the CB island is transported\nalong the edge and then it tunnels through the right QCP to the right FQH liquid.\nUsing the Landauer formula one can see [5] that the CB conductance is\n\u0012 \u0013\nh\nGL GR\n(1)\nGCB (T, \u03c6 ) =\nGis (T, \u03c6 ),\n2\ne\nGL + GR\nwhere the CB island's conductance Gis depends on the magnetic flux \u03c6 = B.A: for\nmost values of the flux we have Coulomb blockade (G = 0) and for special discrete\nvalues of flux we have conductance peaks [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The tunneling conductances of the two QPCs are independent of the flux and vanishing at low-temperature\nas GL,R \u221d T 4\u2206 \u22122 where \u2206 is the scaling dimension of the electron operator.\n\n2 Coulomb blockade island's conductance\u2013the CFT point of view\nAn interesting observation in this setup is that the conductance of the CB island can\nbe explicitly computed at finite temperature within the framework of the conformal\n\n\fHilbert space for Coulomb blockade\n\n3\n\nfield theory [5]. This is due to the Einstein's relation [11, 5], which expresses the\nconductance \u03c3 (0) in terms of the charge stiffness (or, thermodynamic density of\nstates)\n\u2202n\n\u03c3 (0) = e2 D\n,\n(2)\n\u2202\u03bc T\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient, \u03bc is the chemical potential, n is the electron\ndensity and the thermodynamic derivative is at constant temperature.\nThe diffusion coefficient is usually related to the relaxation time [11], for normal conductors, however, for a ballistic one-dimensional channel, such as the FQH\nedge, the relaxation time must be replaced by the time-of-flight \u03c4 f and the diffusion\ncoefficient could be written as follows [11]\nDbal = v2F \u03c4 f ,\n\n\u03c4 f = L/(2vF ) \u21d2 D = LvF /2,\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity at the edge and L is the circumference or length of\nthe edge. According to Eq. (2) the charge stiffness can be computed as a derivative\nof the thermodynamic average of the particle number. To this end we shall use the\nGrand canonical partition function for a disk-shaped CB island derived within the\nCFT framework [12, 5]\nZdisk (\u03c4 , \u03b6 ) = trHedge e\u2212\u03b2 (H\u2212\u03bc N) = trHedge e2\u03c0 i\u03c4 (L0 \u2212c/24) e2\u03c0 i\u03b6 Q ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u0001\nc\nwhere the Hamiltonian of the disk H = h\u0304 2\u03c0LvF L0 \u2212 24\nis related to the zero mode\nof the Virasoro stress-tensor, c is the Virasoro central charge [12], vF is the Fermi\nvelocity of the edge states and L is the circumference of the disk; the particle number\n\u221a\nd current and \u03bdH is the\nQ \u2261 N = \u03bdH J0 is proportional to the zero mode of the u(1)\nFQH filling factor.\nThe Hilbert space Hedge for the edge-states depends on the number and type of\nthe residual quasiparticles which might be localized in the bulk when the magnetic\nfield varies slightly around the value corresponding to the plateau of the Hall conductance. The thermodynamic parameters, such as the temperature and the chemical\npotential are related to the modular parameters \u03c4 and \u03b6 on the torus introduced in a\nstandard way for the rational CFTs [12]\n\n\u03c4 = i\u03c0\n\nT0\n,\nT\n\nT0 =\n\nh\u0304vF\n,\n\u03c0 kB L\n\n\u03b6 =i\n\n1\n\u03bc.\n2 \u03c0 kB T\n\n(4)\n\n2.1 CFT disk partition function in presence of AB flux\nWhen magnetic field threading the CB disk or the area of the disk are changed\nthe effect on the one-dimensional edge state's system1 is through the variation of\n1 due to the incompressibility of the FQH droplet, the states in the bulk are localized and the only\nstates capable of carrying electric current are living on the edge which is a one-dimensional channel\n\n\f4\n\nL.S.

The rational CFT for a FQH state\nd current algebra which is completely determined by the filling\nalways contains a u(1)\nfactor \u03bdH = nH /dH .

In particular, the electron field operator must have a nontrivial neutral component when nH > 1, hence the neutral Virasoro algebra must be\nnon-trivial, too. This also implies that the charged and neutral parts of the RCFT are\nnot completely independent and therefore the partition function will not be simply\na product of charged and neutral partition functions \u2013 instead there are pairing rules\nfor the admissible combinations of charged and neutral characters.\n\n3 Decomposable subalgebra and ZnH grading\nIn this section we will consider in more detail the algebraic structure of the rational\nCFT corresponding to a general FQH state on a disk.\nd part2 of the electron field operator, constructed\nWe start by noting that the u(1)\nd vertex exponent [15], with a charge parameter determined by the filling\nas a u(1)\nfactor,\n: \u03c8el (z)\u03a8 (0) (z) : \u2243 : e\n\n\u2212i \u221a\u03bd1 \u03c6 (c) (z)\nH\n\n:,\n\n(12)\n\nof a chiral boson normalized by\nh\u03c6 (c) (z)\u03c6 (c) (w)i = \u2212 ln(z \u2212 w),\n\n(13)\n\ncertainly commutes with all neutral field operators.

(16) is in fact a ZnH -graded direct sum decomposition.\nThe virtue of having a decomposable subalgebra is that it defines the following\ndual algebra inclusion\nAD \u2282 A \u2282 A \u2217 \u2282 AD\u2217 ,\n(17)\nwhich simplifies the construction of the representation spaces. It follows from\nEq. (17) that all representations of A are also representations of AD and at the\nsame time that not all representations of AD are true representations of A .\nGiven that the decomposable algebra (15) is simply a tensor product, its irreducible representations (IR) are labeled by pairs of quantum numbers (l, \u039b ), where\nl is the electric charge of the bulk quasiparticles in such units that Qel (bulk) = l/dH ,\nand \u039b is the (total) neutral topological charge of the bulk quasiparticles. Then, it\nfollows from Eq. (16) that all IRs of A are direct sums of IRs of AD , corresponding\nto the orbit of the simple current's action, hence we shall be labeling the irreducible\nrepresentations of A by the same pair (l, \u039b ), corresponding to the s = 0 component\nin Eq. (16).\n\n\fHilbert space for Coulomb blockade\n\n7\n\nAs follows from Eq. (17), not all representations of AD are true representations\nof the original superalgebra A . In order to identify the physical excitations, corresponding to the true representations of A we will require that they are local with\nrespect to the electron field. The locality principle implies that those IRs of AD\nwhich are local with respect to the electron are also IRs of A . To formulate more\nprecisely the locality requirement let us consider the decomposition of the electron\nd and neutral parts\nfield and an arbitrary excitation labeled by (l, \u039b ) into u(1)\nelectron:\n\n\u03c8el (z) = : e\n\nexcitation:\n\n\u03c8l,\u039b (z) = : e\n\nd\n\u2212i \u221a H\n\nnH dH\n\ni\u221a l\n\nnH dH\n\n\u03c6 (c) (z)\n\n\u03c6 (c) (z)\n\n(0)\n\n: \u03a8\u03c9 (z)\n(0)\n\n: \u03a8\u039b (z),\n\nd boson is normalized as in Eq. (13), the electric charge is related to\nwhere the u(1)\nd label l by Qel (l) = l/dH , so that the electric charge label of the electron is\nthe u(1)\nl = \u2212dH , and \u03c9 denotes the (nontrivial) neutral topological charge of the electron.\nNow, to identify the physical excitations within the extended dual algebra AD\u2217\nwe require local operator product expansion (OPE) of the excitation with respect\nto the electron, i.e., we require the power of the coordinate distance (z \u2212 w) in the\nshort-distance OPE to be integer\n\u2212 n l +Q\u03c9 (\u039b )\n\n\u03c8el (z)\u03c8l,\u039b (w) \u2243 (z \u2212 w)\nz\u2192w\n\nH\n\n:e\n\nl\u2212dH\nnH dH\n\ni\u221a\n\n\u03c6 (c) (z)\n\n(0)\n\n: \u03a8\u03c9 \u2217\u039b (w),\n\nwhere Q\u03c9 (\u039b ) is the (neutral) monodromy charge defined by the following combination of conformal dimensions \u2206\u039b \u2032 of the neutral Virasoro IRs\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2206\u03c9 = \u2206 (0) .\n(18)\nQ\u03c9 (\u039b ) \u2261 \u2206\u03c9 \u2217\u039b \u2212 \u2206\u039b \u2212 \u2206\u03c9 mod Z,\nThus, the locality condition implies that the physical excitations (respectively, the\ntrue IRs of A ) must satisfy the following ZnH pairing rule which selects the admissible pairs (l, \u039b ) of charged and neutral quantum numbers\nnH Q\u03c9 (\u039b ) \u2261 l mod nH .\n\n(19)\n\nd \u2297 A (0) labeled by the pairs (l, \u039b ) which\nThe representation spaces of AD = u(1)\nm\nobey the PR (19) (that guarantees these pairs are true representations of the original\n(c)\nalgebra A ) are naturally tensor products of the representation spaces Hl for the\nd current algebra and those, H (0) , for the neutral Virasoro algebra, i.e.\nu(1)\n\u039b\n\nHl,D\u039b = Hl\n\n(c)\n\n(0)\n\n\u2297 H\u039b ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhich explains why we looked for a decomposable subalgebra.\nThe representation spaces Hl,A\u039b for the original algebra A can be obtained by the\naction of A over the lowest-weight state |l, \u039b i.

Fortunately, for most of the FQH universality\nclasses these functions are explicitly known.\n\n5 Application: Coulomb blockade in the Z3 Read\u2013Rezayi state\nd part is explicitly sepThe structure of the partition function (23), in which the u(1)\narated, is very convenient for the computation of the CB peaks for a FQH island at\nd partifinite temperature since the variation of the AB flux \u03c6 changes only the u(1)\ntion functions (24) because of Eq. (5). Consider, for example a CB island in which\nthe FQH state is the Z3 Read\u2013Rezayi (parafermion) state [17, 18], characterized by\n\n\f10\n\nL.S. Georgiev\n\nd \u00d7 W3 ,\nnH = 3, dH = 5, i.e. \u03bdH = 3/5. The decomposable chiral subalgebra is u(1)\n15\nwhere W3 is the Z3 parafermion algebra of Fateev-Zamolodchikov [19]. The neutral\npart of the electron operator has a topological charge \u03c9 = \u03c81 , \u03c9 2 = \u03c82 given by\nthe parafermion currents. As a simple illustration of the entire procedure let us consider the case when there are no quasiholes in the bulk, which corresponds to l = 0,\n\u039b = 0. The partition function (23) takes the form\nZ0,0 (\u03c4 , \u03b6 ) = K0 (\u03c4 ; 3\u03b6 ; 15)ch00 (\u03c4 ) + K5 (\u03c4 ; 3\u03b6 ; 15)ch01 (\u03c4 ) + K\u22125 (\u03c4 ; 3\u03b6 ; 15)ch02 (\u03c4 )\nwhere the K functions are defined in Eq.
