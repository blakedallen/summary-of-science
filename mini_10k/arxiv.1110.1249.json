First of all, we recall the main definitions from the hypergraph theory.\n\n1.1\n\nMain definitions\n\nA hypergraph H is a pair H = (V, E), where V = V (H) is some finite set (called the vertex\nset of the hypergraph) and = \u0001E(H) is a collection of subsets of V , which are called the edges\nof the hypergraph. If E \u2286 Vk , i.e. every edge contains exactly k vertices, then H is called\n(k)\nk-uniform. By Kn we denote a complete k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices.\nA vertex coloring of the vertex set V is called proper for hypergraph H = (V, E) if in this\ncoloring there is no monochromatic edges in E. A hypergraph H is called r-colorable, if there\n\u2217\n\nThis work was partially supported by the grant 09-01-00294 of Russian Foundation for Basic Research and\nthe grant MD-8390.2010.1 of the Russian President.\n\u2020\nThis work was partially supported by Russian Foundation of Fundamental Research (grant no. 09-0100294), by the program Leading Scientific Schools\" (grant no. NSh-8784.2010.1) and by the grant of President\n\"\nof Russian Federation (no. MK-3429.2010.1).\n\n1\n\n\fexists a proper coloring with r colors (r-coloring) for H. The chromatic number \u03c7(H) of a\nhypergraph H is the minimum r such that H is r-colorable.\nLet v be a vertex of a hypergraph H. The degree of v in H is the number of edges of\nH containing v. By \u2206(H) we denote the maximum vertex degree of the hypergraph H. A\nhypergraph H = (V, E) is called l-simple, if every two of its distinct edges do not share more\nthan l common vertices, i.e.\n\u2200 e, f \u2208 E, f 6= e : |e \u2229 f | \u2264 l.\nA 1-simple hypergraph is usually called simple hypergraph. A cycle of length 3 (3-cycle or\ntriangle) in the hypergraph H is a unordered set of three distinct edges (e, f, h) such that\n(e \u2229 f ) \\ h 6= \u2205, (e \u2229 h) \\ f 6= \u2205, (h \u2229 f ) \\ e 6= \u2205.\nIn this article we study the binomial model of a random hypergraph. Given integers n >\nk \u2265 2 and a real number p \u2208 [0, 1], random hypergraph H(n, k, p) is a random spanning\n(k)\nsubhypergraph of the complete k-uniform hypergraph Kn with the following distribution: for\n(k)\nany spanning subhypergraph F of Kn ,\nP (H(n, k, p) = F ) = p|E(F )| (1 \u2212 p)(k )\u2212|E(F )| .\nn\n\n(k)\n\nThis definition immediately implies that every edge of Kn is included in H(n, k, p) independently\nwith equal probability p.\nSuppose Qn is a property of k-uniform hypergraphs on n vertices. We say that Qn is an\nincreasing property if, for any two k-uniform hypergraphs H and G on n vertices, H has property\nQn and E(H) \u2286 E(G) imply that G has property Qn . For given function k = k(n) \u2265 2, the\nfunction p\u2217 = p\u2217 (n) is said to be a threshold (or a threshold probability) for an increasing\nproperty Qn , if\n\u2022 for any p = p(n) such that p \u226a p\u2217 , P (H(n, k, p) has property Qn ) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e;\n\u2022 for any p = p(n) such that p \u226b p\u2217 , P (H(n, k, p) has property Qn ) \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nIt follows from general results of B. Bollob\u00e1s and A. Thomason (see [1]) concerning monotone\nproperties of random subsets that for any function k = k(n) \u2265 2 and any increasing property\nQn , the threshold probability exists. In this article we are concentrated on the estimating\nthe threshold probability for r-colorability of H(n, k, p), i.e. for an increasing property Qn =\n{hypergraph is not r-colorable}, where r = r(n) \u2265 2 is some function of n. In the next\nparagraph we shall give a background of this problem.\n\n1.2\n\nPrevious results\n\nThe r-colorability of random hypergraph H(n, k, p) was most intensively studied in the case\nof fixed k and r = 2. It appears that in this case the transition from 2-colorability to non-2colorability is sharp. It follows form the general results of E. Freidgut (see [2]) that for any\nk \u2265 3, there exists a sequence dk (n) such that for any \u03b5 > 0,\n\u0001\n\u2022 if p \u2264 (dk (n) \u2212 \u03b5)n/ nk , then P (H(n, k, p) is 2-colorable) \u2192 1,\n2\n\n\f\u2022 but if p \u2265 (dk (n) + \u03b5)n/\n\nn\nk\n\n\u0001\n\n, then P (H(n, k, p) is 2-colorable) \u2192 0.\n\nIt is widely believed that dk (n) can be replaced by a constant dk .\nFirst bounds for the threshold probability of 2-colorability were obtained by N. Alon and\nJ. Spencer. They showed (see [3]) that there is a positive absolute constant c such that\nif k \u2265 k0 is fixed and p \u2264 c\n\n2k\u22121 n\n\u0001 , then P (H(n, k, p) is 2-colorable) \u2192 1,\nk 2 nk\n\nif k \u2265 3, \u03b5 > 0 are fixed and p \u2265 (1 + \u03b5) 2k\u22121 ln 2\nthen P (H(n, k, p) is 2-colorable) \u2192 0.\n\nn\n\u0001\nn ,\n\n(1)\n\nk\n\n(2)\n\nThe gap between upper and lower bounds in (1) and (2) was reduced by D. Achlioptas, J.H.\nKim, M. Krivelevich and P. Tetali from the order k 2 to the order k. They proved (see [4]) that\nfor any fixed k \u2265 3,\nif p \u2264\n\n1 2k\u22121 n\n\u0001 , then P (H(n, k, p) is 2-colorable) \u2192 1.\n25 k nk\n\n(3)\n\nFinally, Achlioptas and C. Moore established (see [5]) the following bound for the threshold\nprobability of 2-colorability for all sufficiently large k: there is a constant k0 such that, for any\n\u03b5 > 0 and any fixed k \u2265 k0 ,\nif p \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) 2k\u22121 ln 2\n\nn\n\u0001\nn , then P (H(n, k, p) is 2-colorable) \u2192 1.\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nTogether with the upper bound (2) the inequality (4) gives the exact value of the considered\nsharp threshold for 2-colorability in the case of fixed k \u2265 k0 :\np\u2217 = 2k\u22121 ln 2\n\nn\n\u0001\nn .\nk\n\nThe r-colorability of H(n, k, p) for r > 2 is not studied in such detail as 2-colorability. The\nfollowing lemmas are just natural generalizations of the results (1) and (2) of Alon and Spencer.\nLemma 1. There exist positive constants C, c > 0 such that for any k = k(n) \u2265 3 and\nr = r(n) \u2265 2, satisfying the conditions r k\u22121 /k \u2265 C and r k\u22121 = o(n) the following statement\nholds:\nr k\u22121 n\nif p \u2264 c 2 n\u0001 , then P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 1.\n(5)\nk\nk\nLemma 2. Let the functions k = k(n) and r = r(n) satisfy the relation k 2 r = o(n). Then for\nany fixed \u03b5 > 0,\nif p \u2265 (1 + \u03b5) r k\u22121 ln r\n\nn\n\u0001\nn , then P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 0.\nk\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fAnother result for r-colorability of random hypergraphs was obtained by Achlioptas, Kim,\nKrivelevich and Tetali. In the final comment of their paper [4] they stated (with providing an\nalgorithm of the proof) that the result (3) can be generalized to the case of r colors in the\nfollowing form.\nTheorem 1. (D. Achlioptas, J.H. Kim, M. Krivelevich, P. Tetali, [4]) Suppose k \u2265 3 and r \u2265 2\nare fixed. If p = p(n) satisfies the inequality\np\u2264\nthen P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 1.\n\nr(r + 1)! r k\u22121 n\n\u0001,\n(r + 1)2(r+1) k nk\n\n(7)\n\nIt is easy to see that the bound (5) of Lemma 1 is better than (7) if\nk\u2264c\n\n(r + 1)2(r+1)\n= \u03a9 (r r ) .\nr(r + 1)!\n\nSo, Theorem 1 gives a new result only when r is small in comparison with k: r = O(ln k/ ln ln k).\nThe threshold probability for r-colorability of the random hypergraph H(n, k, p) in the case\nwhen r is large in comparison with k can be obtained by using the results concerning the\nchromatic number of H(n, k, p) (recall, e.g., that (4), (7) are nontrivial only when k is much\nlarger than r). This problem was studied by a series of researchers (see, e.g., [6], [7] for the\nbackground). In our paper we study H(n, k, p) in the \"sparse\" case, i.e. the function p = p(n)\nis sufficiently small. For such values of p, M. Krivelevich and B. Sudakov proved (see [7]) the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 2. (M. Krivelevich, B. Sudakov, [7]) Let k \u2265 3 be fixed. There is a constant d0 = d0 (k)\nsuch that, for any p = p(n) satisfying the conditions\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\u22121\np \u2265 d0 , d = o(nk\u22121 ),\nd = d(n) = (k \u2212 1)\nk\u22121\nthe following convergence holds:\nP\n\n\u0012\n\nd\nk ln d\n\n\u00131/(k\u22121)\n\n\u2264 \u03c7(H(n, k, p)) \u2264\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u00131/(k\u22121) !\n28k ln ln d\nd\n1+\n\u2192 1.\nk ln d\nln d\n\nOne can make an immediate corollary from this theorem.\nCorollary 1. Let k \u2265 3 and \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) be fixed. There is a constant r0 = r0 (k, \u03b5) such that, for\nany r = r(n) satisfying the conditions\nr \u2265 r0 ,\n\nr k\u22121 ln r = o(nk\u22121 ),\n\nthe following convergence holds:\nP (\u03c7(H(n, k, p)) \u2264 r) \u2192 1, where p = (1 \u2212 \u03b5) r k\u22121 ln r\n4\n\nn\n\u0001\nn .\nk\n\n\f\u0001\nCorollary 1 together with Lemma 2 shows that the function p\u2217 = r k\u22121 ln r n/ nk is a\nthreshold probability in the wide range: k is fixed, r is sufficiently large in comparison with k\nand r k\u22121 ln r = o(nk\u22121 ).\nHowever, Theorem 2 (and, consequently, Corollary 1) can be proved not only for fixed k,\nbut for slowly growing functions k = k(n) also. The calculations from the proof of Theorem 2\nprovides the following necessary relations between d, p, k and n:\n\u00013(k\u22121)\u22121/2\nd \u2265 (ln d)28k\u221227 , n1/3 \u2265 ln(nk\u22121 p)\n.\n(8)\nThese relations implies that in Corollary 1 we have the following restrictions:\n\u0001\nr = \u03a9 k 29 (ln k)28 , n \u2265 k 9k+O(k ln ln k/(ln k)) .\n\n(9)\n\nSo, despite the fact that Corollary 1 gives very good lower bound for the threshold probability,\nits statement holds only for large r in comparison with k: r = \u03a9 (k 29 (ln k)28 ). Recall that (7) is\nbetter than (5) only when r = O(ln k/ ln ln k). Hence, in the very wide range of the values of r,\nln k\n\u2264 r \u2264 k 29 (ln k)28 ,\nln ln k\n\n(10)\n\nonly the lower bound from Lemma 1 is known.\nRemark 1. The proof of Theorem 2 seems possible to be adopted to the case of smaller values\nof the parameter d (and, consequently, parameter r in Corollary 1) than given by (8) . But, for\nexample, the final condition r > k 4 seems to be necessary. So, the case when r is not very large\nin comparison with k is certainly not well studied.\nWe have finished discussing previously known results and now proceed to the new ones.\n\n2\n\nNew results\n\nOur main approach of studying the threshold for r-colorability of random hypergraph\nH(n, k, p) is to apply methods and results concerning extremal problems of hypergraph coloring\ntheory.\n\n2.1\n\nColorings of hypergraphs with bounded vertex degrees\n\nFor all k, r \u2265 2, let \u2206(k, r) denote the minimum possible \u2206(H), where H is a k-uniform\nnon-r-colorable hypergraph. The problem of finding or estimating the value \u2206(k, r) is one of\nthe classical problems in extremal combinatorics. First bounds for \u2206(k, r) were obtained by P.\nErd\u0151s and L. Lov\u00e1sz (see [8]), they proved that for all k, r \u2265 2,\nr k\u22121\n\u2264 \u2206(k, r) \u2264 20k 2 r k+1 .\n4k\n\n(11)\n\nKostochka and R\u00f6dl improved (see [9]) the upper bound from (11). They showed that for all\nk, r \u2265 2,\n\u0006\n\u0007\n\u2206(k, r) \u2264 k r k\u22121 ln r .\n5\n\n\fClassical lower bound (11) of Erd\u0151s and Lov\u00e1sz was improved by J. Radhakrishnan and A.\nSrinivasan (see [10]) in the case r = 2. They proved that for large n,\n\u2206(k, 2) \u2265 0.17 \u221a\n\n2k\n.\nk ln k\n\nTheir result is still the best one in the case of two colors.\nWhen r > 2 D.A. Shabanov proved (see [11]) a lower bound with slightly better \"polynomial\"\nfactor: for any k \u2265 3, r \u2265 3,\n1\n(12)\n\u2206(k, r) > k \u22121/2 r k\u22121.\n8\nThe last known result concerning \u2206(k, r) was recently obtained\nby A.V. Kostochka, M. Kumbhat\n\u221a\nand V. R\u00f6dl (see [12]). They showed that if r = r(n) \u226a ln ln k, then\n\u22124r 2\n\n\u2206(k, r) > e\n\n\u0012\n\nk\nln k\n\n\u230alog 2 r\u230b\n\u0013 \u230alog\nr\u230b+1\n2\n\nrk\n.\nk\n\n(13)\n\nThe following lemma clarifies the connection between the value \u2206(k, r) and the threshold\nfor r-colorability of random hypergraph H(n, k, p).\nLemma 3. Suppose k = k(n) \u2265 2 and r = r(n) \u2265 2 satisfy the relation\n3\n\u2206(k, r) \u2212 ln n \u2192 \u2212\u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\n16\n\n(14)\n\nIf\np\u2264\nthen P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 1.\n\n1 \u2206(k, r) n\n\u0001\nn ,\n2\nk\nk\n\nProof. Since the probability P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) decreases with growth of p, we have to\n\u0001\u22121\nn\ndeal only with p = 12 \u2206(k,r)\n.\n= 21 \u2206(k, r) n\u22121\nn\nk\nk\u22121\n(k )\nLet v be a vertex of H(n, k, p) and let Xv\u0001 denote\nthe degree of v in H(n, k, p). It is clear that\n\u0001\nn\u22121\nXv is a binomial random variable Bin k\u22121 , p . We shall need a classical bound on probability\nof large deviations for binomial variables (so called, Chernoff bound): if X is a binomial random\nvariable, then for any \u03bb > 0,\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03bb2\n.\n(15)\nP (X \u2265 EX + \u03bb) \u2264 exp \u2212\n2(EX + \u03bb/3)\nThe proof of this classical fact can be found, e.g., in the book [13]. Using (15) with \u03bb = EX we\nget\n\u0013 \u0013\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u001b\n3\nn\u22121\np = P (Xv \u2265 \u2206(k, r)) \u2264 exp \u2212\nP Xv \u2265 2\n\u2206(k, r) .\nk\u22121\n16\nConsequently we obtain the following bound for the probability of the existence of the\nvertices with large degree in H(n, k, p):\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n3\n3\n\u2206(k, r) = exp ln n \u2212\n\u2206(k, r) \u2192 0\nP (\u2206(H(n, k, p)) \u2265 \u2206(k, r)) \u2264 n exp \u2212\n16\n16\n6\n\n\fas n \u2192 +\u221e. The last relation follows from the condition (14). Thus, by the definition of the\nvalue \u2206(k, r) we have\nlim P(\u03c7(H(n, k, p)) \u2264 r) \u2265 lim P (\u2206(H(n, k, p)) < \u2206(k, r)) = 1.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nLemma 3 is proved.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs a corollary of Lemma 3 and the bounds (12) and (13) for \u2206(k, r) we immediately obtain\nthe following lower bound for the threshold for r-colorability of H(n, k, p).\nCorollary 2. 1) Suppose k = k(n) \u2265 3 and r = r(n) \u2265 3 satisfy the relation\n3 r k\u22121\n\u221a \u2212 ln n \u2192 \u2212\u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\n128 k\nIf\np\u2264\n\n3 r k\u22121 n\n\u0001,\n32 k 3/2 nk\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nthen P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 1.\n2) Suppose k = k(n) \u2265 3 and r = r(n) \u2265 2 satisfy the relation\n3 \u22124r2\ne\n16\n\u221a\nIf r = o( ln ln k) and\n\n\u0012\n\nk\nln k\n\n\u230alog2 r\u230b\n\u0013 \u230alog\nr\u230b+1\n2\n\n3 \u22124r2\np\u2264\ne\n16\n\n\u0012\n\nrk\n\u2212 ln n \u2192 \u2212\u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\nk\n\nk\nln k\n\nthen P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 1.\n\n\u230alog 2 r\u230b\n\u0013 \u230alog\nr\u230b+1\n2\n\nrk n\n\u0001,\nk 2 nk\n\n(18)\n\nLet us compare the results of Corollary 2 with previous ones. Since Corollary 1 gives almost\ncomplete answer, we have to compare (17) and (18) with (5) from Lemma 1 and (7) from\nTheorem 1. Although the bounds (5) and (7) formally hold only when k and r are fixed,\nthe analogous statements can be proved by using the same arguments for growing functions\nk = k(n) and r = r(n). For example, the analysis of the calculations in the papers [3], [4] and\n[5] shows that\n1. The statement of Lemma 1 holds for almost all functions k = k(n) and r = r(n), since it\nis true for r k\u22121 = o(n) and in the case r k\u22121/k \u2265 22 ln n we can just apply Lemma 3 with\nthe classical bound (11) of Erd\u0151s and Lov\u00e1sz.\n2. The proof of Theorem 1 can be\u221aextended to the following range of values of k = k(n) and\nr = r(n): r is fixed and k = o( n).\n3. The proof of the result (4) by Achlioptas and Moore does not work for any growing\nk = k(n). It is also unclear how to generalize it to case of fixed r > 2. Thus, we do not\ncompare our new results with (4), since we consider only the situation when k or r (or\nboth of them) is a growing function of n.\n7\n\n\fLet us sum up the obtained information. The lower bound (5) from Lemma 1 holds almost for\nall r and k. Theorem 1 also can be extended to a wide area of the values of the parameters.\nEverywhere below for simplicity we shall compare only the values of the bounds.\nBoth (17) and (18) are obviously better than (5). The second bound (18) is worse than (7).\nIndeed, the right hand-side of (7) is at least\ne\u22122r ln r\n\nr k\u22121\n,\nk\n\nwhich is better than (18), whose right hand-side is at most\ne\u22124r\n\nr k\u22121\n\n2\n\nk (\u230alog2 r\u230b+2)/(\u230alog2 r\u230b+1)\n\n.\n\nThe first bound (17) of Corollary 2 is better than (7) if\n\u221a\n\nk<\n\n3 (r + 1)2(r+1)\n.\n32 r(r + 1)!\n\nThis inequality holds, e.g., when r \u2265 ln k/ ln ln k.\nLet us make intermediate conclusions. Our new lower bound (7) for the threshold probability\nof r-colorability of random hypergraph H(n, k, p) improves all previously known results in the\nfollowing wide area (see condition (9) of Corollary 1 and condition (16) of Corollary 2):\nln k/ ln ln k \u2264 r \u2264 k 29 (ln k)28\n\nand\n\nr k\u22121\n\u221a \u226b ln n.\nk\n\n(19)\n\nWe see that in the area (19) the parameter r cannot be very small in comparison with the\nnumber of vertices n, but it can be very large. In the next paragraph we shall present a better\nbound when r is not very small and also is not very large in comparison with n.\n\n2.2\n\nMain result\n\nThe main result of our paper is formulated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. Suppose \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) is a constant. Let k = k(n) and r = r(n) \u2265 2 satisfy the\nfollowing conditions: k \u2265 k0 (\u03b4) , where k0 (\u03b4) is some constant, and, moreover,\n(k \u2212 1) ln r <\nwhere \u03c6(k) = 4\n\njq\n\nln k\nln(2 ln k)\n\nk\u22121\n\n1\u2212\u03b4\nln n,\n2\n\nr k\u22121k \u2212\u03c6(k) \u2265 6 ln n,\n\n(20)\n\n. Then for function p = p(n), satisfying\np\u2264\n\n1 r k\u22121 n\n\u0001,\n2 k 1+\u03c6(k) nk\n\nwe have P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n8\n\n(21)\n\n\fLet us compare the result of Theorem 3 with previous ones. It is clear that the restriction\n(21) is weaker (for all sufficiently large k) than our previous results (17) and (18) obtained\nin \u00a72.1. It is also obvious that (21) is better than the lower bound (5) from Lemma 1 for all\nsufficiently large k. So, it remains only to compare (21) with the result of Theorem 1 proved by\nAchlioptas, Krivelevich, Kim and Tetali. We see that (21) is asymptotically better than (7) if\nk\n\nk\u22121\njq\nln k\n4\nln(2 ln k)\n\n<\n\n(r + 1)2(r+1)\n.\n2r(r + 1)!\n\n\u221a\nThis inequality holds, e.g., in the following asymptotic area: r \u226b ln k.\nThus, our main result (21) gives a new lower bound for the threshold probability for rcolorability of the random hypergraph H(n, k, p). This new bound improves all the previously\nknown results in the wide area of the parameters (recall that we are working in the area (10)):\n\u221a\nln k \u226a r \u2264 k 29 (ln k)28 and 6 k \u03c6(k) ln n \u2264 r k\u22121 \u2264 n(1\u2212\u03b4)/2 .\nFor example, (21) provides a new bound when k \u223c r \u223c ln n/(5 ln ln n). Moreover, our result\n(21) is only k 1+\u03c6(k) ln r times smaller than the upper bound (6) from Lemma 2.\nThe proof of Theorem 3 is based on some result concerning colorings of 2-simple hypergraphs\nwith bounded vertex degrees. The study of problems for colorings of simple hypergraphs was\ninitiated by Erd\u0151s and Lov\u00e1sz in [8]. Later the extremal problems concerning colorings of lsimple hypergraphs with bounded vertex degrees have been considered by Z. Szab\u00f3 (see [14]),\nA.V. Kostochka and M. Kumbhat (see [15]), D.A. Shabanov (see [16]). To prove Theorem 3 we\nconsider 2-simple hypergraphs with a few 3-cycles.\nLet H be an arbitrary hypergraph with the following properties: H is k-uniform, \u03c7(H) > r,\nH is 2-simple and for every edge of H, there are at most \u03c9 3-cycles containing that edge. The\nclass of all such hypergraphs we will denote by H(k, r, \u03c9). Let us consider the following extremal\nvalue:\n\u2206(H(k, r, \u03c9)) = min {\u2206(H) : H \u2208 H(k, r, \u03c9)} .\np\nTheorem 4 gives an asymptotic lower bound for \u2206(H(k, r, \u03c9)) for \u03c9 = \u230a ln k/(ln ln k)\u230b.\nTheorem 4. There exists an integer k0 such that for all k \u2265 k0 , all r \u2265 2 and all \u03c9 \u2264\np\nln k/(ln ln k),\n\u2206(H(k, r, \u03c9)) > r\n\nk\u22121\njq\nln k\nk\u22121 \u22124\nln(2 ln k)\n\nk\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nIt should be noted that the inequality (22) holds for all possible values of the parameter\nr, which is important for studying r-colorability of random hypergraphs. For a k-uniform, 2simple, non-r-colorable hypergraph the lower bound for the maximum vertex degree similar to\n(22) is known only in the case of small r in comparison with k: r = O(ln k) (see [16] for the\ndetails).\nThe structure of the rest of the article will be the following. In the next paragraph we\nshall deduce Theorem 3 from Theorem 4. Section 3 will be devoted to the proof of Theorem 4.\nFinally, in Section 4 we shall discuss choosability in random hypergraphs.\n\n9\n\n\f2.3\n\nProof of Theorem 3\n\nDue to the decreasing of the probability P (H(n, k, p) is r-colorable) with growth of p we\nk\u22121\nhave to deal only with p = 2kr1+\u03c6(k) nn . We want to apply Theorem 4 to random hypergraph\n(k )\nH(n, k, p), so, we have to show that with probability tending to 1 H(n, k, p)\npsatisfies the\nfollowing conditions: it is 2-simple, every edge is contained in at most \u03c9 = \u230a ln k/ ln ln k\u230b\n3-cycles and, moreover, \u2206(H(n, k, p)) < \u2206(H(k, r, \u03c9)).\nLet v be a vertex of the random hypergraph H(n, k, p) and let Xv denote\n\u0001 \u0001 the degree of v\nn\u22121\nin H(n, k, p). It is clear that Xv is a binomial random variable Bin k\u22121 , p . Using Chernoff\nbound (15) with \u03bb = EXv and the condition (20), we have\n\u0001\n\b\nP Xv \u2265 r k\u22121k \u2212\u03c6(k) \u2264 exp \u22123r k\u22121 k \u2212\u03c6(k) /16 \u2264 exp{\u2212(9/8) ln n} = n\u22129/8 .\nThus,\n\n\u0001\nP \u2206(H(n, k, p)) \u2265 r k\u22121 k \u2212\u03c6(k) \u2264 n * n\u22129/8 = o(1).\n\n(23)\n\nLet Y denote the number of pairs of edges, whose intersection has cardinality at least 3,\nand let Z denote the number of edges, which are contained in a large number, more than \u03c9, of\n3-cycles. We estimate the expectations of these two random variables:\n\u00012\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121 !2\n\u00132\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\nk\u22121\n3 6\nr k\u22121 k 4\nn\nr\nn\nn\nk\nn n\u22123\n2\nn\n.\n=\np \u2264 6\nEY \u2264\nk\nn\nk\nk\nn\nk\u22123\n3\nConsequently,\n(20)\n\u03b4\nln EY = (2k \u2212 2) ln r + 4 ln k \u2212 ln n \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) ln n + 4 ln k \u2212 ln n \u2264 \u2212 ln n.\n2\n\nHence, limn\u2192\u221e EY = 0 and\nP (H(n, k, p) is 2-simple) \u2192 1.\n\n(24)\n\nNow we will consider edges, that are contained in a large number of triangles. Suppose u is\nan edge of H(n, k, p). Let us denote by Tu the set of all triangles, containing u. Furthermore,\nwe denote by D(u\u2032 , u) the degree of an edge u\u2032 with respect to u, a number of 3-cycles from Tu ,\ncontaining an edge u\u2032 6= u. Similarly, for any vertex v \u2208 V (H(n, k, p)), we denote by d(v, u)\nthe the degree of vertex v with respect to u, a number of triangles (u, u\u2032, u\u2032\u2032) from Tu such that\nv \u2208 (u\u2032 \u2229 u\u2032\u2032) \\ u.\nNow we will estimate the number of edges that have big degree with respect to Tu for some\nu. Denote by Z1 (u) the number of edges, having degree greater than 4 with respect to u, i.e.\nZ1 (u) = |{u\u2032 \u2208 E(H(n, k, p)) : D(u\u2032, u) > 4}| .\nP\nMoreover, let us denote Z1 =\nZ1 (u).

At first we choose the vertex from the intersection of the edge\nu\u2032 with large degree and the edge u. Then we choose the rest vertices of these two edges. Then\nwe choose 5 vertices on both of edges, that correspond to remaining vertices of five 3-cycles.\nThen we choose the last edge of each 3-cycle.\nThus,\nP (for any u, u\u2032 \u2208 E(H(n, k, p)), D(u\u2032 , u) \u2264 4) \u2192 1.\n(25)\nSimilarly, we shall show, that with probability tending to one, d(v, u) \u2264 4 for any edge u\nand any vertex v \u2208\n/ u.

For example, it follows from (27) that\nr\nln ln k\n\u03b4 = 50\nln k\nis sufficient.\n\n3\n\nProof of Theorem 4\n\nThe proof of Theorem 4 is based on the method of random recoloring. This method in the\ncase of two colors was developed in the papers of J. Beck [17], J. Spencer [18], Radhakrishnan\nand Srinivasan [10]. In this paper we follow the work [16] concerning r-colorings of l-simple\nhypergraphs with bounded edge degrees.\nThe structure of the proof will be the following. In the next section we will formulate a\nmultiparametric Theorem 5 which provides a new lower bound of the maximum edge degree\nin a hypergraph from the class H(k, r, \u03c9). Then we will prove Theorem 5. Finally we deduce\nTheorem 4 from Theorem 5 by choosing the values of the required parameters.\n12\n\n\f3.1\n\nGeneral theorem\n\nTheorem 4 is a simple corollary of the following multiparametric theorem.\nTheorem 5. Let k \u2265 3, r \u2265 2, \u03c9 \u2265 1 be integers, let b, \u03b1 be positive numbers. Let us denote:\n%\n$s\nln k\n\u03b1 ln k\n, q=\n.\n(29)\nt=\nln(\u03b1 ln k)\nk\nLet H = (V, E) be an k-uniform 2-simple hypergraph such that for every edge in H there are\nat most \u03c9 3-cycles that contain that edge. Let, moreover, every edge of hypergraph H intersects\nat most d other edges of H, where\nd \u2264 r k\u22121k 1\u2212b/t \u2212 1.\n\n(30)\n\nb \u2264 t < k \u2212 \u03c9,\n2\n1\n\u2264q\u2264 ,\nk\n2\n\n(31)\n\nIf the following inequalities hold\n\n(t + 1)2 2\u2212b\nk2\nt+\u03c9\n1\u2212\u03b1 \u03b1(ln k)(t+\u03c9)/k\n+\n(t\n+\n1)k\ne\n(\u03b1\nln\nk)\n+\nk (\u03b1 ln k)t\u03c9 +\n2k\nt!\n\u0012\n\u0013t\u22121\n2e\u03b1 ln k\n1\n+ (t + 1)t\nk 1+\u03b1\u2212b <\nt\u22121\n4\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nthen \u03c7(H) \u2264 r.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is based on a method of vertex random coloring. To prove Theorem\n5 we have to show the existence of a proper vertex r-coloring for hypergraph H. We shall\nconstruct some random r-coloring and estimate the probability that this coloring is not proper\nfor H. If this probability is greater than 0, then we prove the existence of a required coloring,\nand the theorem follows.\n\n3.2\n\nAlgorithm of random recoloring\n\nWe follow the ideas of Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan from [10] and the construction from\n[16] concerning random recoloring. Let V = {v1 , . . . , vw }. The algorithm consists of two phases.\nPhase 1. We color all vertices randomly and uniformly with r colors, independently from\neach other. Let us denote the generated random coloring by \u03c70 .\nThe obtained coloring \u03c70 can contain monochromatic edges and \"almost monochromatic\"\nedges. An edge e \u2208 E is said to be almost monochromatic in \u03c70 if there is a color u such that\nn \u2212 t \u2212 \u03c9 + 2 \u2264 |{v \u2208 e : v is colored by u in \u03c70 }| < n.\nIn this case, the color u is called dominating in e. For every v \u2208 V , u = 1, . . . , r, let us use the\nnotations\nM(v) = {e \u2208 E : v \u2208 e, e is monochromatic in \u03c70 } ,\nAM(v, u) = {e \u2208 E : v \u2208 e, e is almost monochromatic in \u03c70 with dominating color u} .\n13\n\n\fPhase 2. In this phase, we want to recolor some vertices from the edges, which are\nmonochromatic in \u03c70 . We consider the vertices according to an arbitrary fixed order v1 , . . . , vw .\nLet {\u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7w } be mutually independent equally distributed random variables, taking values\n1, . . . , r with the same probability p (the value of the parameter p will be chosen later) and the\nvalue 0 with probability 1 \u2212 rp. The recoloring procedure consists of w steps.\nStep 1. Assume that M(v1 ) 6= \u2205 and, moreover, there is no u = 1, . . . , r and e \u2208 AM(v1 , u) such\nthat\n(a) \u03b71 = u,\n(b) v1 is the only vertex in e, which is not colored by u in \u03c70 .\nThen we try to recolor v1 according to the value of the random variable \u03b71 :\n\u2022 if \u03b71 = 0, then we do not recolor v1 ,\n\n\u2022 if \u03b71 6= 0, then we recolor v1 in the color \u03b71 .\n\nIn all the other situations, we do not change the color of v1 . Let \u03c71 be the coloring after\nconsidering v1 .\nNow let the vertices v1 , . . . , vi\u22121 have been considered, so that the coloring \u03c7i\u22121 is obtained.\nStep i. Assume that some f \u2208 M(vi ) is still monochromatic in \u03c7i\u22121 and, moreover, there is no\nu = 1, . . . , r and e \u2208 AM(vi , u) such that\n(a) \u03b7i = u,\n(b) vi is the only vertex in e, which is not colored by u in \u03c7i\u22121 .\nThen we try to recolor vi according to the value of the random variable \u03b7i :\n\u2022 if \u03b7i = 0, then we do not recolor vi ,\n\n\u2022 if \u03b7i 6= 0, then we recolor vi in the color \u03b7i .\n\nIn all the other situations, we do not change the color of vi . Let the resulting coloring be\n\u03c7i .\nLet \u03c7\u0303 be the coloring obtained after the consideration of all the vertices.\nNow we are going to give a more formal construction of the random coloring \u03c7\u0303 using the\ntechniques of random variables. This is very useful for the further proof. We analyze the event\nF that \u03c7\u0303 is not a proper coloring for H. We divide F into some \"local\" events and estimate\ntheir probabilities. Finally, we use Local Lemma to show that all these events do not occur\nsimultaneously with positive probability. This implies that \u03c7\u0303 is a proper coloring of H with\npositive probability, and, hence, H is r-colorable.\n\n14\n\n\fFormal Construction of the random coloring from \u00a73.2\n\n3.3\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume, that V = {1, 2, 3, . . . , w}. Let us also fix an\narbitrary ordering of the edges of H. Consider, on some probability space, the following set of\nmutually independent random elements:\n1. \u03be1 , . . . , \u03bew - equally distributed random variables, taking values 1, 2, . . . , r with equal\nprobability 1/r.\n2. \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7w - equally distributed random variables taking values 1, 2, . . . , r with equal\nprobability p and the value 0 with probability 1 \u2212 rp. We take the parameter p equal to\np = q/(r \u2212 1). By the condition (32) such choice of the parameter is correct, i. e., for\nevery r \u2265 2, one has the inequalities rp \u2264 r/(2(r \u2212 1)) \u2264 1.\nLet e \u2208 E be an edge of H. For every u = 1, . . . , r, let M(e, u) and AM(e, u) denote the\nfollowing events:\n)\n(\n\\\nX\nM(e, u) =\n{\u03bes = u}, AM(e, u) = 0 <\nI{\u03bes 6= u} \u2264 t + \u03c9 \u2212 2 .\n(34)\ns\u2208 e\n\ns\u2208 e\n\nWe shall introduce successively random variables \u03b6i , i = 1, . . . , w. Let D1 and A1 denote the\nfollowing events:\nr\n[ [\nD1 =\nM(e, u),\nA1 =\nand let\n\nr\n[\n\n[\n\nf \u2208 E: 1\u2208 f u=1\n\ne\u2208 E: 1\u2208 e u=1\n\n(\n\n\u03be1 6= u, \u03b71 = u,\n\nX\n\ns\u2208 f : s>1\n\nI{\u03bes = u} = k \u2212 1\n\n)\n\n!\n\n\u2229 AM(f, u) ,\n\n\u03b61 = \u03be1 I{D1 \u222a {\u03b71 = 0} \u222a A1 } + \u03b71 I{D1 \u2229 {\u03b71 6= 0} \u2229 A1 }.\n\nFor every i > 1, let Di and Ai denote the events\n(\nr\n[ [\nM(e, u) \u2229\nDi =\ne\u2208 E: i\u2208 e u=1\n\nAi =\n\n[\n\nr\n[\n\nf \u2208 E: i\u2208f u=1\n\n(\n\n\u03bei 6= u, \u03b7i = u,\n\nWe define \u03b6i in the following way:\n\nX\n\n\\\n\ns\u2208 e: s<i\n\nI{\u03b6s = u} +\n\ns\u2208 f : s<i\n\n)\n\n{\u03b6s = u} ,\n\nX\n\ns\u2208 f : s>i\n\nI{\u03bes = u} = k \u2212 1\n\n)\n\n\u2229 AM(f, u) .\n\n\u03b6i = \u03bei I{Di \u222a {\u03b7i = 0} \u222a Ai } + \u03b7i I{Di \u2229 {\u03b7i 6= 0} \u2229 Ai }.\nIt is easy to see that the random variables \u03b6i take values only from {1, 2, . . . , r}. So, we may\ninterpret the random vector \u03b6~ = (\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6w ) as a random r-coloring of the vertex set V (we\nassign the color \u03b6i to the vertex i).

But before we establish a simple inequality, which\nwe will use later. It follows from (32) that\n\u03b1 ln k = qk \u2265 2.\n\n(37)\n\nNote that the last inequality implies that the parameter t in (29) is correctly defined (there is\nno negative number under the square root).\n\n3.4\n\nFirst part of F : the event C0(e, u)\n\nIf the event C0 (e, u) occurs, then for every s \u2208 e, one has \u03b6s = \u03b7s , since \u03b6s 6= \u03bes . We get the\nrelation\nr\nr\nr\n[\n[\n\\\n[\n{\u03b7s = u, \u03bes = a} = Q0 (e).\n(38)\nC0 (e, u) \u2282\nu=1\n\nu=1 a=1, a6=u s\u2208 e\n\nThe probability of the event Q0 (e) can be easily calculated:\nP(Q0 (e)) =\n\nr\nr\nX\nX\nY\nu=1 a=1, a6=u s\u2208 e\n\n3.5\n\nP (\u03b7s = u, \u03bes = a) = r(r \u2212 1)\n\n\u0010 p \u0011k\nr\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nSecond part of F : the event C1 (e, u)\n\nSuppose that the event C1 (e, u) occurs.

Consider the following partition of the event C1 (e, u):\nC1 (e, u) = S0 (e, u) \u222a S1 (e, u),\nwhere\nS0 (e, u) = C1 (e, u) \u2229\nS1 (e, u) = C1 (e, u) \u2229\n\n(\nX\ns\u2208 e\n\n(\nX\ns\u2208 e\n\n(40)\n)\n\nI {\u03b7s \u2208\n/ {0, u}} \u2264 t + \u03c9 \u2212 1 ,\n)\n\nI {\u03b7s \u2208\n/ {0, u}} > t + \u03c9 \u2212 1 .\n\nConsider the event S0 (e, u).

Let us fix v \u2208 e satisfying \u03b7v \u2208\n/ {0, u}. As it was noted\nabove, the event Av should happen for every such vertex. This event implies that for some edge\nf , v \u2208 f , and some color a 6= u, the following event has to occur\n(\n)\nX\nX\nW(v, f, u, a) = \u03bev = u, \u03b7v = a,\nI{\u03b6s = a} +\nI{\u03bes = a} = k \u2212 1 \u2229 AM(f, a).\ns\u2208 f : s<v\n\ns\u2208 f : s>v\n\nIt is easy to show that f 6= e, moreover, f \u2229 e = {v}. Indeed, for all s \u2208 e, it holds that\n\u03bes = \u03b6s = u, but for all s \u2208 f \\{v}, either \u03b6s = a, or \u03bes = a.\nSuppose {v1 , . . . , vh } = {v \u2208 e : \u03b7v \u2208\n/ {0, u}}. For any i = 1, . . . , h, the event S1 (e, u)\nimplies the event W(vi , fi , u, ai ) for some edge fi satisfying {vi } = fi \u2229 e and some color ai 6= u.\nMoreover, S1 (e, u) also implies that h = h(e, u) \u2265 t + \u03c9. Since there are at most \u03c9 3-cycles\ncontaining e, there is a subset {f1\u2032 , . . . , ft\u2032 } \u2282 {f1 , . . . , fh } such that fi\u2032 and fj\u2032 are disjoint for\nall i 6= j.\nFor further convenience, we introduce a notation of the configuration of the first type. For\ngiven edge e, the set of edges {f1 , . . . , ft } is said to be the configuration of the first type\n(denotation: {f1 , . . . , ft } \u2208 CONF1(e)) if, for any any i = 1, . . . , t, |fi \u2229 e| = 1 and, moreover,\nall the edges fi are pairwise disjoint.\nThus, by the above arguments we the following relation\nS1 (e, u) \u2282\n\n\\\n\n{\u03bes = u} \u2229\n\ns\u2208 e\n\nr\n[\n\n[\n\nt\n\\\n\na1 ,..., at =1 {f1 ,..., ft }\u2208 CONF1(e) i=1\nai 6=u\n\nW(e \u2229 fi , fi , u, ai ),\n\n(43)\n\nwhere the set of edges {f1 , . . . , ft } is assumed to be ordered according to the originally selected\nordering of E, i. e. the number of the edge fi is less than the number of the edge fj , if i < j.\nLet us use the notations: fbi = fi \\e and vi = e \u2229 fi , i = 1, . . . , t. It follows from the definition\nof the configuration of the first type that the sets fbi , i = 1, . . . , t do not have common vertices,\ni.e. fbi \u2229 fbj = \u2205, if i 6= j.

The\nfirst one implies that for every s \u2208 e satisfying \u03bes 6= u, we have \u03b6s = \u03b7s = u. Moreover, since the\nevent AM(e, u) holds, the set of such vertices in not empty. Consider a vertex v \u2208 e satisfying\n\u03bev 6= u and \u03bes = u for every s \u2208 e, s > v. It is clear that the event Av holds. So, \u03b6v = \u03bev 6= u,\nand we get a contradiction with the first event in the intersection. Thus, these three events are\ninconsistent, and we prove the equality (48).\nLet us estimate the probability of C2 (e, u). Consider the random set T = {s \u2208 e : \u03bes 6= u}.\nThe event C2 (e, u) implies, first, that all v \u2208 T satisfy \u03b6v = \u03b7v = u, and second, that |T | \u2265\nt + \u03c9 \u2212 1 (see (48)). Let us use the denotation: E(e) = {f \u2208 E\\{e} : f \u2229 e 6= \u2205}.\nIf \u03b6v 6= \u03bev for some vertex v, then there should happen at least two events: the event Dv\nand the event\n)\n(\n\\\n{\u03b6s = av } \u2229 {\u03b6v = \u03b7v = u} ,\n(49)\nB(e, fv , v, u, av ) = M(fv , av ) \u2229\ns\u2208 fv : s<v\n\nwhere fv is some edge, satisfying v \u2208 e \u2229 fv , v is the first vertex from e \u2229 fv and av 6= u is some\ncolor. It is clear that edges fv are different for different v.\nLet Y be an arbitrary subset of the edge e satisfying y = |Y | \u2265 t + \u03c9 \u2212 1. Then we have the\ninclusion\nC2 (e, u) \u2229 {T = Y } \u2282\n\n\\\n\ns\u2208 e\\Y\n\n{\u03bes = u} \u2229\n\nr\n[\n\n[\n\ny\n\\\n\na1 ,..., ay =1 f1 ,...,fy \u2208 E(e) i=1\nai 6=u\nvi \u2208 fi \u2229e\n\nB(e, fi , vi , u, ai ),\n\n(50)\n\nwhere vi is the first vertex from fi \u2229 e. Since y \u2265 t + \u03c9 \u2212 1 and the edge e is contained in at most\n\u2032\n\u03c9 3-cycles, there is a set of edges {f1\u2032 , . . . , ft\u22121\n} \u2282 {f1 , . . . , fy } such that the sets fbi\u2032 = fi\u2032 \\ e,\ni = 1 . . . , t \u2212 1, are pairwise disjoint and, moreover, the first vertices of fi \u2229 e are different for\ndifferent i = 1, . . . , t \u2212 1.\nFor further convenience, we introduce a notation of the configuration of the second type. For\ngiven edge e, an unordered set of edges F = {f1 , . . . , ft\u22121 } is said to be the configuration of the\nsecond type (denotation: F \u2208 CONF2(e)) if, for any any i = 1, . . . , t, fi \u2208 E(e) and, moreover,\nall the sets fi \\ e are pairwise disjoint.

The hypergraph H(F ) =\n(V, F ) can be divided into some number of connected components. Suppose H1 , . . . , Hl are these\ncomponents. Since F is a configuration of the second type, the edges fi and fj can have common\nvertices only inside the edge e. Moreover, we know that H is 2-simple. For every component\nHj , j = 1, . . . , l, let us use the denotations:\nhj = |{f \u2208 E(Hj ) : |f \u2229 e| = 2}| and lj = |{f \u2208 Hj : |f \u2229 e| = 1}|.\nDue to the 2-simplicity of H we have\nl\nX\nj=1\n\n(hj + lj ) = t \u2212 1.\n\n(55)\n\nFor any component Hj , let Gj be the following graph: Gj = (Vj , Ej ), where\nVj = e \u2229 V (Hj ),\n\nEj = {f \u2229 e : f \u2208 E(Hj ) and |f \u2229 e| = 2}|.\n\nThe following claim clarifies the structure of the configurations of the second type.\nClaim 1. For any j = 1, . . . , l, Gj is either a tree or an isolated vertex.\nProof. If hj = 0 then lj > 0. But in this case Hj consists of only one edge f . Indeed, if\ng \u2208 E(Hj ), g 6= f , then |g \u2229 e| = 1 and, moreover, |g \u2229 f | > 0. This can only happens when\nf \u2229 e = g \u2229 e, i.e. g has the same first vertex in its intersection with e as f . This fact is in\nconflict with the definition of the configuration of the second type. So, Gj is just an isolated\nvertex.\nNow let hj > 0. Since Hj is connected and F \u2208 CONF2(e), Gj is also connected. Suppose\nthere is a cycle (w1 , . . . , wm ), m \u2265 3, in Gj , i.e. {wi , wi+1 } \u2208 E(Gj ), i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1 and,\nmoreover, {w1 , wm } \u2208 E(Gj ). Without loss of generality, assume that w1 < wj for any j > 1,\ni.e. w1 is the vertex with the least number in the cycle. Since {w1 , w2 } \u2208 E(Gj ), there is an\nedge g1 \u2208 E(Hj ) such that {w1, w2 } = g1 \u2229 e, so w1 is the first vertex in g1 \u2229 e. By analogy,\nthere is another edge g2 \u2208 E(Hj ) such that {w1 , wm } = g2 \u2229 e, so w1 is also the first vertex in\ng2 \u2229 e. We obtain a contradiction with the fact that F \u2208 CONF2(e). Hence, Gj is a tree.\n\u0003\nClaim 1 implies that |V (Gj )| = |E(Gj )| + 1 = hj + 1, thus,\n|S(F )| =\n\nl\nX\nj=1\n\n|V (Gj )| =\n\nl\nX\n\n(hj + 1).\n\n(56)\n\nj=1\n\nMoreover, from the definitions of the values hj and lj we get that, for any j = 1, . . . , l,\n[\n\nf \u2208Hj\n\nf = (k \u2212 2)hj + (k \u2212 1)lj + |V (Gj )| = (k \u2212 1)(hj + lj ) + 1.\n21\n\n(57)\n\n\fFinally, Claim 1 implies that, for any j = 1, . . . , l,\nlj \u2264 1.\n\n(58)\n\nIndeed, since there is a bijection between the edges of Hj and the first vertices in their\nintersection with e, we have\nhj + lj = |E(Hj )| \u2264 |V (Gj )| = hj + 1,\nand the inequality (58) follows.\nUsing the notations introduced above one can easily find the probability of the event\nQ3 (e, F ) (see (53)):\nP (Q3 (e, F )) = r\n\n\u0012\n\n1 q\n+\nr r\n\n\u0013k\u2212|S(F )|\n\np\n\n|S(F )|\n\n(r \u2212 1)\n\nl\n\nl\nY\n\nr\n\n\u2212\n\nS\n\nf \u2208Hj\n\nf\n\n.\n\n(59)\n\nj=1\n\nLet us explain the last two factors in the right-hand side of (59). Since all the edges of F are\nmonochromatic in the main coloring \u03be, the values of \u03bes should coincide for all s \u2208 V (Hj ). Thus,\nwe only have to choose a color (not equal to u) for every component (the factor (r \u2212 1)l ). The\nlast factor is equal to the probability (we have already chosen the colors) that every edge in\nthe component Hj is monochromatic in the main coloring \u03be.\nUsing obtained relations (55), (56), (57), (58), we get the following estimate of the probability\nof the event Q3 (e, F ):\nP (Q3 (e, F )) = r\n\n\u0012\n\n1 q\n+\nr r\n\n\u0013k\u2212|S(F )|\n\np\n\n|S(F )|\n\n= r 1\u2212k (1 + q)k\u2212|S(F )|(rp)|S(F )| (r \u2212 1)l\n\n(r \u2212 1)\nl\nY\n\nl\n\nl\nY\n\nr\n\n\u2212\n\nS\n\nf \u2208Hj\n\nf\n\n=\n\nj=1\n\nr \u2212(k\u22121)(hj +lj )\u22121 =\n\nj=1\n\n= r 1\u2212k (1 + q)k\u2212|S(F )|(rp)|S(F )| (r \u2212 1)l r \u2212(k\u22121)(t\u22121)\u2212l \u2264\n\u2264 r (1\u2212k)t (1 + q)k (rp)|S(F )| \u2264 r (1\u2212k)t (1 + q)k (2q)t\u22121 .\n\n(60)\n\nWe need to comment only the last inequality. From the condition (32) we have 2q \u2264 1 and,\nmoreover, we know that rp = (r/(r\u22121))q \u2264 2q. Finally, from (55), (57) and (58) we immediately\nsee that |S(F )| \u2265 t \u2212 1.\nThe bound (60) completes the estimation of different parts of the event F . Now we shall\nprove that the probability of F is less than 1 under the conditions of Theorem 5.\n\n3.7\n\nApplication of Local Lemma for estimating the probability of F\n\nRemember that by the definitions (35) and (36) of the events F and Ci (e, u), i = 1, 2, 3,\ne \u2208 E, u = 1, . . . , r, we have the equality\nF=\n\nr\n[[\n\ne\u2208E u=1\n\n(C1 (e, u) \u222a C2 (e, u) \u222a C3 (e, u)) .\n22\n\n\fIt follows from the obtained relations (38), (40), (41), (46) and (54), that\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\nF\u2282\n{Q0 (e) \u222a Q1 (e)} \u222a\nQ2 (e, F ) \u222a\ne\u2208 E\n\ne\u2208 E F \u2208 CONF1(e)\n\ne\u2208 E F \u2208 CONF2(e)\n\nQ3 (e, F ).\n\n(61)\n\nFurther, we shall use a classical claim, which is called Local Lemma.

B = Q3 (e, F ) for some e \u2208 E and F \u2208 CONF2(e).\nFor any B \u2208 \u03a8, we define the domain D(B) of the event B as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2e,\n! if B = Qi (e), i = 0, 1;\nS\nD(B) =\n\uf8f4\nf , if B = Qi (e, F ), i = 2, 3.\n\uf8f3e \u222a\nf\u2208 F\n\n23\n\n\fBy the definitions (38), (41), (45), (53) the event B belongs to the algebra generated by the\nrandom variables {\u03bej , \u03b7j : j \u2208 D(B)}. Then this event is independent of the algebra generated\nby the random variables {\u03bej , \u03b7j : j \u2208 V \\ D(B)}. We take the system \u03a8B consisting of all the\nevents Q \u2208 \u03a8 such that the domains of Q and B have nonempty intersection. In other words,\n\u03a8B = {Q \u2208 \u03a8 : D(Q) \u2229 D(B) 6= \u2205} .\nThus, the event B is independent of the algebra generated by {J \u2208 \u03a8\\\u03a8B }, if we choose \u03a8B in\nthis way. We have to check the inequality (64). By the choice of the set \u03a8B we get the relation\nX\nX\nX\nP (J ) \u2264\n(P (Q0 (e)) + P (Q1 (e))) +\nP (Q2 (e, F )) +\nJ \u2208 \u03a8B\n\ne\u2208E: e\u2229 D(B)6=\u2205\n\n+\n\ne \u2208E, F \u2208 CONF1(e):\nD(B)\u2229D(Q2 (e,F ))6=\u2205\n\nX\n\nP (Q3 (e, F )) .\n\n(65)\n\ne \u2208E, F \u2208 CONF2(e):\nD(B)\u2229D(Q3 (e,F ))6=\u2205\n\nLet us denote by a(B), b(B) and c(B) the number of summands in the first sum, the second\nsum and the third sum in the right-hand side of (65) respectively. Using these denotations from\nthe relation (65) and the estimates (39), (42), (47), (60) we get the inequality\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010 p \u0011k\nX\n1\u2212k\nk\u2212t\u2212\u03c9\nt+\u03c9\n+\n+ r (1 \u2212 q)\n(kq)\nP(B) \u2264 a(B) r(r \u2212 1)\nr\nJ\u2208\u03a8\nB\n\n+ b(B)r \u2212(t+1)(k\u22121) q t (kq)t(t+\u03c9\u22122) + c(B)r \u2212t(k\u22121) (1 + q)k (2q)t\u22121 .\n\n(66)\n\nNow we shall consider three cases depending on B.\n1. B = Qi (e) for some e \u2208 E and i \u2208 {0, 1}. By the condition (30) of Theorem 5 there exist\nat most d other edges intersecting an arbitrary e \u2208 E.

To show the last two it is sufficient to notice that\ne can intersect either with e\u2032 from the event Q2 (e\u2032 , F ) or with some f \u2208 F .\n\n2. B = Q2 (e, F ) for some e \u2208 E and F \u2208 CONF1(e). This event depends on (t + 1) edges.\nSo, by using the estimates from (67) we get\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\nd\u22121\nd\n,\n+ (d + 1)d\na(B) \u2264 (t + 1)(d + 1), b(B) \u2264 (t + 1) (d + 1)\nt\u22121\nt\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\nd\u22121\nd\n.\n(68)\n+ (d + 1)d\nc(B) \u2264 (t + 1) (d + 1)\nt\u22122\nt\u22121\n24\n\n\f3. B = Q3 (e, F ) for some e \u2208 E and F \u2208 CONF2(e). This event depends on t edges.

There is a constant r0 = r0 (k, \u03b5) such that, for\nany r = r(n) satisfying the conditions\nr \u2265 r0 ,\n\nr k\u22121 ln r = o(nk\u22121 ),\n\nthe following convergence holds:\nP (ch(H(n, k, p)) \u2264 r) \u2192 1, where p = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\n\nr k\u22121 ln r n\n\u0001\nn .\nk\nk\n\nWe see that the lower bound for the threshold for r-choosability provided by Corollary 3\ndoes not coincide with the upper bound in Lemma 2 (if hypergraph is not r-colorable then it is\nalso not r-choosable). Their ratio has an order of k. Recall that applying Theorem 2 provides\nthe following restrictions on the parameters r and k in Corollary 3 (see (9)):\n\u0001\nr = \u03a9 k 29 (ln k)28 , n \u2265 k 9k+O(k ln ln k/(ln k)) .\n(81)\nWhat can be said about the lower bound for the threshold for r-choosability when r =\nO (k 29 (ln k)28 )?\n\n\u221a\nRemark 3. It should be noted that, for very large r (e.g., r > n) and fixed k, Theorem 8\ntogether with Theorem 2 gives an asymptotic value for the required threshold for r-choosability:\np\u2217 \u223c r k\u22121 ln r\n\nn\n\u0001\nn .\nk\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1 by Achlioptas, Krivelevich, Kim and Tetali is based on the deterministic coloring algorithm, which cannot be generalized to the case of an arbitrary r-uniform list\nassignment, so the lower bound (7) does not hold for the threshold probability for r-choosability.\nMoreover, the proof of the result (4) by Achlioptas and Moore is also cannot be adopted for\nlist colorings. Thus, in the case when r is small in comparison with k we have only the result\nof Lemma 1 which is just a generalization of the result (1) by Alon and Spencer.\nLemma 4. There exists an integer k0 and a positive number c such that for any fixed k \u2265 k0\nand r \u2265 2, the following statement holds:\nif p \u2264 c\n\nr k\u22121 n\n\u0001 , then P (H(n, k, p) is r-choosable) \u2192 1.\nk 2 nk\n\n(82)\n\nOur new results concerning r-choosability in random hypergraphs are formulated in the\nfollowing two theorems.\n29\n\n\fTheorem 9. Suppose k = k(n) \u2265 3 and r = r(n) \u2265 3 satisfy the relation\n3 r k\u22121\n\u221a \u2212 ln n \u2192 \u2212\u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\n128 k\n\nIf\np\u2264\nthen P (H(n, k, p) is r-choosable) \u2192 1.\n\n3 r k\u22121 n\n\u0001,\n32 k 3/2 nk\n\n(83)\n\nTheorem 10. Suppose \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) is a constant. Let k = k(n) and r = r(n) \u2265 2 satisfy the\nfollowing conditions: k \u2265 k0 , where k0 is some absolute constant, and, moreover,\n\nwhere \u03c6(k) = 4\n\njq\n\n(k \u2212 1) ln r <\nln k\nln(2 ln k)\n\nk\u22121\n\n1\u2212\u03b4\nln n,\n2\n\nr k\u22121k \u2212\u03c6(k) \u2265 6 ln n,\n\n. Then for function p = p(n), satisfying\n1 r k\u22121 n\n\u0001,\np\u2264\n2 k 1+\u03c6(k) nk\n\n(84)\n\nwe have P (H(n, k, p) is r-choosable) \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nIt is easy to see that Theorem 9 and Theorem 10 stated that the results of Corollary 2\n(assertion 1)) and Theorem 3 also hold in the case of list colorings. Both provided bounds\nare better (for all sufficiently large k) than the result (82) of Lemma 4, and both are worse\nthan the result of Corollary 3. Hence, Theorem 10 gives the best lower bound (18) for the\nthreshold probability for r-choosability of H(n, k, p) in the wide area of the parameters (recall\nthe restriction (81)):\nr \u2264 k 29 (ln k)28 and 6 k \u03c6(k) ln n \u2264 r k\u22121 \u2264 n(1\u2212\u03b4)/2 ,\nwhere k \u2265 k0 is sufficiently large. The inequality (17), in comparison with (18), does not have\nan upper restriction r k\u22121 \u2264 n(1\u2212\u03b4)/4 , so it provides the best lower bound in the area\n3 \u2264 r \u2264 k 29 (ln k)28 and r k\u22121 \u2265 n(1\u2212\u03b4)/2 .\n\nThe proofs of Theorems 9 and Theorem 10 are very similar to the proofs of the first assertion\nof Corollary 2 and Theorem 3, so we do not give the complete argument and describe only the\nmain ides and differences.\n\n4.2\n\nIdeas of the proofs of Theorems 9 and 10\n\nFor given k, r \u2265 2, let \u2206list (k, r) denote the minimum possible \u2206(H), where H is a k-uniform\nnon-r-choosable hypergraph. In [11] D.A. Shabanov shows that the lower bound (12) for \u2206(k, r)\n(see \u00a72.1) holds for \u2206list (k, r) also: for any k, r \u2265 3,\n1 \u22121/2 k\u22121\nk\nr .\n8\nUsing this inequality one can easily prove Theorem 9 by the same argument as in Lemma 3.\n\u2206list (k, r) >\n\n30\n\n\fRemark 4. The lower bound (13) for \u2206(k, r) obtained by Kostochka, Kumbhat and R\u00f6dl does\nnot hold for \u2206list (k, r), so we cannot apply it to r-choosability of random hypergraphs.\nTo prove Theorem 10 it is sufficient to show that under the conditions of Theorem 5 the\nhypergraph H is not only r-colorable, but is r-choosable. The proof of r-choosability remains\nalmost the same. The difference appears in the distributions of the random variables.\nSuppose H = (V, E) is a k-uniform hypergraph satisfying the conditions of Theorem 5 and\nlet L = {L(v) : v \u2208 V } be an r-uniform list assignment with the set of colors N. Without\nloss of generality, V = {1, . . . , w}. In comparison with \u00a73.3 we introduce random variables with\nanother distribution. Let \u03be1 , . . . , \u03bew and \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7w , be mutually independent random variables\nwith the following distribution:\n\u2022 \u03bei , i = 1, . . . , w, has the uniform distribution on the set L(i) (i = 1, . . . , w),\n\u2022 \u03b7i , i = 1, . . . , w, takes all values from L(i) with the same probability p and the value 0\nwith probability 1 \u2212 rp.\nT\nFor given edge e \u2208 E, let M(e) be equal to M(e) = s\u2208 e L(s). For every u \u2208 M(e), we\nintroduce the events M(e, u), AM(e, u) whose definitions are the same as in \u00a73.3 (see (34)).\nThen we construct the random coloring \u03b6~ = (\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6w ) by the same way as in \u00a73.3. The only\ndifference is that in the definitions of the events Ai and Di the parameter u does not take values\nfrom 1 to r, it should take values from an appropriate set M(e) or M(f ). The rest of the proof\nremains the same without any unobvious change.\n\nReferences\n[1] B. Bollob\u00e1s, A. Thomason, \"Thresholds functions\", Combinatorica, 7 (1987), 35\u201338.\n[2] E.
