Nevertheless, it is hard to exaggerate the success\nand the impact of Flory's brilliant scheme for computing the equilibrium size of a swollen polymer chain in a\ngood solvent [1]. Consider such a swollen polymer carrying N monomers with its end-to-end distance R. The\ntrial Flory free energy in d spatial dimensions is then\nexpressed as [2]\n\u03b2Fd (R) \u223c\n\nad N 2\nR2\n+\n,\nN a2\nRd\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a the monomer size, \u03b2 = 1/kB T with kB the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature. (Here\nand below, we only consider an athermal case, \u0131.e., the\nexcluded volume of each monomer is ad , independent\nof T .) The first term describes chain elasticity of entropic spring, while the second term represents the meanfield energy of (two-body) interaction between monomers\nalong the chain [1, 3]. The equilibrium chain size or the\nFlory radius, RF , is obtained by minimizing F with respect to R: For d \u2264 4, RF \u223c aN \u03bd with \u03bd = 3/(2 + d)\n(e.g., \u03bd = 3/5 for d = 3). This exponent \u03bd is rightly\ndesignated as the Flory exponent.\nAs de Gennes correctly pointed out, however, Flory's\ntheory benefits from the remarkable cancellation of errors\n(overestimates) of both terms in Eq. 1 [3]. Note that, at\nR = RF , the Flory free energy scales as\n\u03b2Fd (RF ) \u223c N (4\u2212d)/(2+d) .\n\n(2)\n\nThis result is equivalent to stating that the number of\n1\nmonomer contacts scales as N 2 /RFd \u223c N 2\u2212\u03bdd (\u223c N 5 for\nd = 3 [4]). For d = 3, this is an overestimate in view of\nthe more elaborate analysis in Ref. [5, 6]. On the other\nhand, \u03b2Fd=4 (RF ) \u223c 1 is expected to be asymptotically\nvalid.\nDespite the aforementioned limitations, mainly due to\nits simplicity, Flory-type approaches have been extended\nto many other important cases, e.g., linear chains with\nstiffness [7, 8] and polymers of various topology in a confined space (for a review, see Ref. [9]). In particular, the\nwidely-used free energy of a linear chain in a cylindrical\npore has the following form [9, 10]\n\u03b2F (Rk , D) \u223c\n\nRk2\nN a2\n\n+\n\na3 N 2\n,\nD2 Rk\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Rk is the trial chain size in the longitudinal direction and D the width of the cylinder.\nAlthough Eq. 3 produces the correct scaling for the\n2\nequilibrium chain size Rk0 \u223c N a(a/D) 3 [3], its applicability beyond the computation of Rk0 is severely\nlimited by the following two important errors: (i) For\na chain in equilibrium (Rk = Rk0 ), Eq. 3 predicts\n4\n\u03b2F \u223c N (a/D) 3 , but the correct free energy should\n5\nscale as \u03b2F \u223c N (a/D) 3 [3, 11]. (ii) Eq. 3 results in\nan incorrect effective \"Hookian\" spring constant keff of\nthe chain, \u03b2keff \u223c N \u22121 a\u22122 , but the correct scaling is\n5\n1\n\u03b2keff \u223c N \u22121 D\u2212 3 a\u2212 3 [11, 12]. The two errors are not\nunrelated, and, in fact, arise from the same source. For\ninstance, the entropy term of Eq. 3 fails to correctly\ntake into account the additional length scale D associated with the cylinder \u2013 it erroneously assumes that the\nelasticity is not affected by the presence of confinement.\nHere, we propose the following \"renormalized\" free energy for a polymer under cylindrical confinement.\n\u03b2Fcyl (Rk , D) \u223c\n\nRk2\n(N/g)D2\n\n+\n\nD(N/g)2\n,\nRk\n\n(4)\n\nwhere g is the number of monomers inside a blob of di5\nameter D, \u0131.e., g \u2243 (D/a) 3 . Our basic idea is to consider the confined space inside a cylinder as an effective one-dimensional space (d = 1) and, hence, to introduce the lengthscale D accordingly in Eq. 1 by rescaling\na \u2192 a\u2032 = D and N \u2192 N \u2032 = N/g. Then, the first term\ncan be understood as the chain being made of N/g subunits (\"blobs\") of size D, while the second term describes\nthe mutual exclusion between neighboring blobs. In other\nwords, Eq. 4 represents a self-avoiding chain confined in\na cylinder of diameter D as a one-dimensional Rouse (or\nGaussian) chain with an effective step length D, since\nlong-distance interactions beyond D (along the contour)\nare suppressed; thus, it is also expected to exhibit the\nRouse dynamics [11].\nIndeed, the above free energy produces not only\n2\nthe expected equilibrium chain size Rk0 \u223c N a(a/D) 3 ,\nbut also the correct blob-overlapping free energy of\n5\n\u03b2Fconf \u223c N/g \u223c N (a/D) 3 (namely, the total number\nof blobs) [3, 11]. Note that this is identical to confinement free energy. The way neighboring blobs interact each other is not different from the way they are\nconstrained by the confining wall. Importantly, we obtain the correct effective Hookian spring constant of the\n\n\f2\n1\n\n1\n\nchain: \u03b2keff \u223c \u2202 2 Fcyl /\u2202Rk2 |Rk =Rk0 \u223c N \u22121 a\u2212 \u03bd D \u03bd \u22122 \u223c\n1\n\nN \u22121 a\u22122 (a/D) 3 [11, 12]. Moreover, using the stretchrelease argument, the global (slowest) relaxation time of\nthe confined chain (in the absence of hydrodynamic effects) is then reciprocally obtained as \u03c4R \u223c N/keff \u223c\n1\n1\n1\nN 2 a \u03bd D2\u2212 \u03bd \u223c N 2 a2 (D/a) 3 , consistent with the earlier\nscaling result [11, 12].\nA natural extension of Eq. 4 to the slit case [13] would\nbe obtained from Eq. 1 with the same rescaling of a \u2192\na\u2032 = D and N \u2192 N \u2032 = N/g, assuming d = 2, as follows\n\u03b2Fslit (Rk , D) \u223c\n\nRk2\n(N/g)D2\n\n+\n\nD2 (N/g)2\n,\nRk2\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n\n(5)\n\nwhere D is the distance between the two parallel slits\nand g \u223c (D/a)5/3 . Indeed, this free energy predicts the\ncorrect equilibrium size of the chain in a slit, Rk0 \u223c\naN 3/4 (a/D)1/4 , in agreement with the results of other\napproaches [3, 9]. However, its equilibrium free energy,\n5\n\u03b2Fslit (Rk = Rk0 , D), scales as N 1/2 (a/D) 3 . Note that\nthis is different from the free energy of slit confinement\n5\n\u03b2Fconf \u223c N/g \u223c N (a/D) 3 , which is identical to that of a\ncylinder (see Ref. [3, 13] and references therein). The slit\nfree energy in Eq. 5 describes the arrangement of blobs\nin a slit, not confinement.\nWhy does the Flory approach work better for the cylinder case than for higher dimensions? To see the difference, consider the volume fraction (\u03b1) of monomers inside a space explored by a self-avoiding chain in equilibrium. For cylindrical confinement, this is given by \u03b1 =\nN a3 /D2 Rk0 \u223c (D/a)\u22124/3 , independent of N , whereas,\nboth for a slit and for a dilute bulk solution, \u03b1 \u2192 0\nas N \u2192 \u221e. It is this special nature of compactness\nof one-dimensional space that explains the extensiveness\nand thus the success of the rescaled Flory approach in\nEq. 4 [14].\nExtension of our analysis to semi-flexible polymers and\nchains with non-trivial topology (e.g., branched) is important for understanding many recent experiments on\nDNA in nano- and micro-channels [15] and have nontrivial implications for practical applications such as filtration [16].\nWe thank Daan Frenkel for helpful discussion.

J. Flory, \"Principles of Polymer Chemistry\" (Cornell\nUniversity Press, Ithaca, NY, 1953).\nMore systematically, one can calculate the free energy\nF of a self-avoiding chain using a relatively-simple trial\nmonomer distribution. The Flory approach is equivalent\nto choose R as a variational parameter and use a Gaussian distribution of R, as for an ideal chain. [see, for example, J. des Cloizeaux and G.

To see\nthis, we calculate the relative end-to-end distance fluctu1\n\u22121\nation of the chain using Eq. 4, \u03b4Rk /Rk0 \u223c keff \u2212 2 Rk0\n\u223c\n11\n\n1\n\n(D/a) 6 N \u2212 2 . (This is consistent with the scaling anal11\nysis [11]). Thus, for (D/a) 3 \u226a N , the overall chain\nfluctuations become negligible. On the other hand, the\nnon-compactness of higher spatial dimensions makes the\neffect of fluctuations more serious in that any meanfield\napproach is less reliable. For instance, Eq. 1 for d = 3 er1\nroneously implies that \u03b4R/RF \u223c N \u2212 10 \u2192 0 for large N .\nThe correct relation is \u03b4R \u223c RF \u2013 the chain size in this\ncompact non-compact case is set by the end fluctuation.\nWe believe Eq. 5 suffers from a similar inconsistency.\n[15] H.
