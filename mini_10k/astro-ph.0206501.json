According to the standard\nversion of the most popular theory of the very early universe, the so-called theory of\ninflation, the density fluctuations at primordial epochs should be Gaussian or very close to\nGaussian distributed (see the reviews [1, 2]). This implies that the temperature fluctuations\nin the CMB as observed today should also be close to Gaussian, because they are related by\nlinear theory to fluctuations in the early universe. However, the details of the inflationary\nscenario are still rather unclear. Newer, more sophisticated, versions of inflation predict\nsmall deviations from Gaussianity [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Detecting this non-Gaussianity in the\nCMB would thus be important for understanding the physics of the very early universe.\nThere are also other possible mechanisms for the creation of non-Gaussianity in the CMB.\nIf the universe has undergone a phase transition at early times, this could have given rise to\ntopological defects (See Ref.[9] for a review). These defects would show up as non-Gaussian\nfeatures in the CMB temperature fluctuation field.\n\nWith the high resolution data from the satellite missions MAP[33] and Planck\nSurveyor[34] one could be able to detect possible deviations from non-Gaussianity in the\nCMB. If this is indeed detected it would have a big impact on our understanding of the\nphysics of the early universe. For these reasons, the search for procedures to test for\nGaussianity in high resolution data has recently drawn an enormous amount of attention\nin the CMB literature. A number of methods were proposed, many based upon topological\nproperties of spherical Gaussian fields: the behavior of Minkowski functionals [10, 11],\ntemperature correlation functions [12], the peak to peak correlation function [13], skewness\nand kurtosis of the temperature field [14] and local curvature properties of Gaussian and\nchi-squared fields [15]. Other works have focussed on harmonic space approaches: analysis\nof the bispectrum and its normalized version [16, 17] and the bispectrum in the flat sky\napproximation [18]. The explicit form of the trispectrum for CMB data was derived in\n[19, 20]. Applications to COBE, Maxima and Boomerang data have also drawn enormous\nattention and raised wide debate [21, 22, 23, 24].\n\n2\n\n\fAnother reason to look for non-Gaussianities in CMB data, is to detect effects of\nsystematic errors in the CMB map. One of these systematic effects can be stripes from the\n1/f noise in the detectors which have not been properly removed. Another systematics\nwhich could induce non-physical non-Gaussianities in the map could be the effect of\nstraylight contamination from the galaxy or distortions of the main beam caused by the\noptics of the telescope. Finally astrophysical foregrounds like synchrotron emission, thermal\ndust emission or free-free emission from the galaxy and other extra galactic sources could be\nwrongly interpreted as a physical non-Gaussian signal. It is important that one uses data\nfrom simulated experiments to check whether these systematic effects induce non-physical\nnon-Gaussian signatures in the CMB map.\n\nOur purpose here is to propose a new procedure to detect non-Gaussianity in harmonic\nspace. More precisely, let T (\u03b8, \u03c6) denote the CMB fluctuations field, which we assume,\nas always, to be homogeneous and isotropic, for 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0, 0 < \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0. Assuming that\nT (\u03b8, \u03c6) has zero mean and finite second moments, it is well-known that the following spectral\nrepresentation holds:\nT (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\nalm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) ,\n\nl=1 m=\u2212l\n\nwhere Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) denotes the spherical harmonics. The random coefficients (amplitudes)\n{alm } have zero-mean with variance h|alm |2 i = Cl . They are uncorrelated over l and |m|:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nm\nhalm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i = Cl \u03b4ll \u03b4m\n, and al,m = a\u2217l,\u2212m . The sequence {Cl } denotes the angular power\n\nspectrum of the random field and the asterisk complex conjugation. Furthermore, if T (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nis Gaussian, the {alm } have a complex Gaussian distribution. Upon observing T (\u03b8, \u03c6) on\nthe full sky, the random coefficients can be obtained through the inversion formula\nZ \u03c0Z \u03c0\n\u2217\nalm =\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6 , m = 0, \u00b11, ..., \u00b1l , l = 1, 2, ... .\nT (\u03b8, \u03c6)Ylm\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nOur purpose is to study the empirical distribution function for the {alm } , and to use these\nresults to implement tests for non-Gaussianity in harmonic space. We shall assume that\nthe angular power spectrum is unknown, and the sequence {Cl } estimated from the data;\nas we show below, this has a nonnegligible effect on the behavior of the test, no matter\nhow good is the resolution of the experiment. The plan of the paper is as follows: the\nprocedure we advocate is described in Sections II and III; Section IV presents some empirical\n3\n\n\fresults, whereas Section V is devoted to discussion and to directions for further work. Some\nmathematical results are collected in the Appendix.\n\nII.\n\nTHE UNIVARIATE EMPIRICAL PROCESS\n\nTo motivate our procedure, we start from the (unrealistic) assumption that the sequence\nof coefficients in the angular power spectrum of T (\u03b8, \u03c6), i.e. {Cl }l=1,2,..L , is known; here,\nL is the highest observable multipole, which depends upon the resolution and noise level\nof the experiment (for instance, L \u223c 2000 for Planck). Now recall that, under Gaussianity,\n\n|al0 |2 /Cl and 2|alm |2 /Cl are standard chi-square variates, with one and two degrees of freedom, respectively; furthermore, they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over\nall l. It is clearly computationally convenient to introduce a transformation, in order to work\nwith random variables that have an uniform distribution on [0, 1]. This can be achieved as\nfollows. Write \u03a6i (x), i = 1, 2, for the cumulative distribution function of a chi-square with\ni degrees of freedom; recall that\n\u03a61 (x) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03a62 (x) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\u221a\n\n1\nexp(\u2212u/2)du ,\n2\u03c0u\n\n1\nexp(\u2212u/2)du = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212x/2) , \u03a6\u22121\n2 (\u03b1) = \u22122 log(1 \u2212 \u03b1) .\n2\n\nNow introduce the Smirnov transformation (see for instance Ref.[25])\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2|alm |2\n|al0 |2\n, ulm = \u03a62\n, m = 1, 2, ..., l, l = 1, 2, ...L .\nul0 = \u03a61\nCl\nCl\n\n(2)\n\nIt is immediate to see that the random variables of the triangular array {ulm } are i.i.d. with\na uniform distribution in [0, 1], i.e.\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n2|alm |2\n\u2264\u03b1\nP [ulm \u2264 \u03b1] = P \u03a62\nCl\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2|alm |2\n\u22121\n= P\n\u2264 \u03a62 (\u03b1) = \u03a62 \u03a6\u22121\n2 (\u03b1) = \u03b1 ,\nCl\n\nand likewise for ul0 , because \u03a61 , \u03a62 are strictly increasing and hence invertible. For 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264\n1, we can hence define the empirical distribution function\nl\n1 X\nFl (\u03b1) =\n1(ulm \u2264 \u03b1) ,\nl + 1 m=0\n\n4\n\n\f1(x) denoting the indicator function, i.e the function that takes value unity if ulm smaller or\nequal than \u03b1, zero otherwise; Fl (\u03b1) evaluates the proportion of observed ulm which is below a\ncertain value, and thus provides a sample analogue of P (ulm \u2264 \u03b1) . Then, if the distribution\nof the ulm is uniform indeed, that is, if the alm are actually Gaussian, the Glivenko-Cantelli\nTheorem [25, 26] ensures that, with probability one, Fl (\u03b1) \u2192 \u03b1, uniformly in [0, 1]. This\ncan be viewed as a most intuitive conclusion, as it states that the relative frequency with\nwhich a certain event occurs converges to the probability of the same event, as the number\nof experiments grows. It is therefore natural to look at the distance between Fl (\u03b1) and \u03b1 for\na test of the assumption that the alm are Gaussian. More precisely, a centered and rescaled\nversion of Fl (\u03b1) provides the (sequence of) empirical processes\n\u221a\nGl (\u03b1) = l + 1 {Fl (\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b1} , \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] .\nThe idea is that, if the alm are not Gaussian, then Fl (\u03b1) \u2192 F \u2032 (\u03b1), for some F \u2032 (\u03b1) such that\nsup |F \u2032 (\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b1| > 0, and hence Gl (\u03b1) will exhibit very high values as a distinctive feature of\nnon-Gaussianity, at least over some \u03b1. On the other hand, if the alm are Gaussian, Fl (\u03b1)\u2212\u03b1\nconverges to zero for all \u03b1, whereas Gl (\u03b1) converges to a well-known process, the Brownian\nbridge [25, 27], the sup of which has a tabulated distribution which can be used to derive\nthreshold values.\nAn apparent deviation from Gaussianity over some l, however, must be careful assessed;\nindeed, in the Gaussian case, the single Gl (x) are independently distributed; hence, if we run\na test at the 95% confidence level, we should expect approximately 5% of the multipoles\nto provide results above the threshold level. To avoid spurious detections, our aim is to\ncombine rigorously the information over all different multipoles l into a single statistic.

The idea is to evaluate what random\nfluctuations we can expect over the multipoles, if the underlying field is Gaussian. Note\nthat, if there is any departure from Gaussianity, then the behavior of KL (r, \u03b1) should also\ndetect the location of the non-Gaussianity in harmonic space.\nIt is immediate to see that\nhKL (r, \u03b1)i = 0 ,\n5\n\n\fwhereas simple calculations show also that,\nlim hKL (r1 , \u03b11 )KL (r2 , \u03b12 )i = min(r1 , r2 ) {min(\u03b11 , \u03b12 )(1 \u2212 max(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ))} .\n\nL\u2192\u221e\n\n(3)\n\nWith more effort it is actually possible to establish a much stronger result, i.e. functional\nconvergence in the distribution; more precisely [28], as L \u2192 \u221e\nKL (r, \u03b1) \u21d2 K(r, \u03b1) ,\nwhere K(r, \u03b1) (the so-called Kiefer-Muller process) is a Gaussian zero mean random field\non [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] (\u03b1 and r in [0, 1]) with covariance function given in (3). Here, \u21d2 means\nweak convergence in a functional sense [26]; this is a much stronger notion of convergence\nthan simply requiring that the distribution of KL (r, \u03b1) is asymptotically the same as the\ndistribution of K(r, \u03b1), for all fixed r and \u03b1. The difference can be explained as follows: for\nstatistical inference, we must actually consider some functional of KL (r, \u03b1), for instance the\nsup in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type test. Now convergence in the distribution for every fixed\npoint does not entail convergence of continuous functionals such as the sup, whereas this is\ngranted by the stronger notion of convergence we are exploiting here.\nWe are now in a position to relax the restrictive assumption that the angular power spectrum\nis known, to consider the more realistic case where the latter is estimated from the data.\nWe take\nbl =\nC\n\nl\nX\n1\n|alm |2 ,\n2l + 1 m=\u2212l\n\nso that a Smirnov-type transformation analogous to (2) now reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2|alm |2\n|al0 |2\n,u\nblm = \u03a62\n, m = 0, 1, 2, ..., l, l = 1, 2, ...L .\nu\nbl0 = \u03a61\nbl\nbl\nC\nC\nLikewise, we have an estimated empirical distribution function\nFbl (\u03b1) =\n\nl\n1 X\n1(b\nulm \u2264 \u03b1) ,\nl + 1 m=0\n\nand the empirical process with estimated parameters\nn\no\n\u221a\nb\nb\nGl (\u03b1) = l + 1 Fl (\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b1\n[Lr]\n\nX\nbl (\u03b1) , 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 , 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 .\nb L (\u03b1, r) = \u221a1\nG\nK\nL l=1\n6\n\n\fIt is important to stress that, due to the presence of estimated parameters, the normalized\nrandom coefficients u\nblm are no longer independent as m varies, for a fixed l; on the other\n\nhand, independence across different multipoles l is maintained.\nbl converges to Cl as l grows, it might be conjectured that the effect\nBecause of course C\nof using estimated parameters becomes asymptotically negligible, for L large.

Our experience with simulated maps suggests that the difference between these\ntwo approaches is quite negligible as a first approximation. As before, it is possible to show\na much stronger result than convergence of the mean and variance, i.e., as L \u2192 \u221e\nb \u2032 (\u03b1, r) \u21d2 K(\u03b1,\nb\nK\nr) ,\nL\n\nb\nwhere we write K(\u03b1,\nr) for the zero mean Gaussian process on [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] with zero mean\n\nand covariance given in (8); the convergence is meant in the uniform, functional sense\n\nintroduced before [26, 27]. It is important to notice that the limiting distribution does not\ndepend on any nuisance parameter, i.e. the asymptotic distribution is completely modelindependent, given Gaussianity. The structure of the limiting covariance measure may have\nsome interest for statistical application: for instance, it is well-known from the theory of\nGaussian fields that maxima will approximately occur in the region where the variance\n(equations 3 and 8) of the field itself peaks [29]. In our case, this corresponds roughly to\n\u03b1 \u2243 0.4, r \u2243 1: a maximum located far away from this value may by itself suggest some\nnon-Gaussianity in the alm .\nThe previous results, however, afford much more powerful and well-established tests for\nGaussianity. For instance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type of test is implemented, for any\nsuitably large L, if we evaluate\n(1)\n\nb L\u2032 (\u03b1, r)| ,\nSL = sup sup |K\n\n(10)\n\n0\u2264r\u22641 0\u2264\u03b1\u22641\n\nand compare the observed value with the threshold level obtained, for any desired size of\nthe test, by\n(1)\nb \u2032 (\u03b1, r)| ;\nS\u221e\n= sup sup |K\n0\u2264r\u22641 0\u2264\u03b1\u22641\n\nthe latter value can be readily derived by Monte Carlo simulation; note that the limiting\ndistribution does not entail any unknown, nuisance parameter. Likewise, a Cramer-Von\n8\n\n\fMises type test can be implemented by looking at (see Ref.[25])\nZ 1Z 1\n(2)\nb \u2032 (\u03b1, r))2d\u03b1dr .\nSL =\n(K\nL\n0\n\n(11)\n\n0\n\nThe relative performance of (10) and (11) depends on the nature of departure from Gaussianity; for instance, (10) may perform better in cases when there is a relatively strong\nnon-Gaussianity, concentrated on a limited subsets of multipoles, whereas (11) is better\nsuited for circumstances where the non-Gaussian behavior is more evenly spread over many\ndifferent angular frequencies. Likewise many other types of goodness-of-fit statistics can be\nb \u2032 (\u03b1, r) should diverge, at least for\neasily implemented, based upon the notion that the field K\nL\n\nsome (\u03b1, r), if non-Gaussianity is truly present in the marginal distribution of the spherical\nharmonic coefficients.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MULTIVARIATE EMPIRICAL PROCESS\n\nThe procedure of the previous Section is centered upon the search for non-Gaussianity\nin the marginal distribution of the {alm }. The empirical results presented in Section IV\nfor some toy models show that the resulting tests are very efficient indeed, if the {alm } are\nactually non-Gaussian. For some other toy models, namely those where the non-Gaussianity\nis strong in pixel space, the proposed procedure turns out to have much less power. This\ncan be intuitively explained as follows. Take T (\u03b8, \u03c6) to be, for instance, some nonlinear\ntransform of an underlying Gaussian field, and evaluate the spherical harmonic coefficients\nby (1); then, due to a central limit theorem argument, the resulting linear combinations\nover the pixels can have a distribution much closer to Gaussian in harmonic space. In this\ncase the non-Gaussianity may show up as a dependency between alm of different multipoles.\nWith this in mind, in the present section we develop some more powerful tests for nonGaussianity, which consider the joint distribution of the alm coefficients over different l and\nm values. More precisely, in the bivariate case we look at the joint empirical distribution\nfunction\nFbl1 l2 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) =\n=\n\nl1\n1 X\n1(b\nu l 1 m \u2264 \u03b11 , u\nbl2,m+\u2206m \u2264 \u03b12 )\nl1 + 1 m =0\n1\n\nl1\n1 X\n1(b\nul1 m \u2264 \u03b11 )1(b\nul2,m+\u2206m \u2264 \u03b12 ) ,\nl1 + 1 m =0\n1\n\n9\n\n\ffor some integer \u2206m \u2265 0; in the sequel, we shall always use the sum modulus l2 , e.g.,\nh\ni\nm\nm + \u2206m = m + \u2206m \u2212 m+\u2206\nl2 , if m + \u2206m > l2 (here [x] means integer-value) . In the\nl2\n\ngeneral multivariate case we focus on\n)\n(\nk\nl1\nY\nX\n1\nu l 1 m \u2264 \u03b11 )\n1(b\nuli,m+\u2206mi \u2264 \u03b1i ) , \u2206mi \u2265 0 .\n1(b\nFbl1 ...lk (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1k ) =\n(l1 + 1) m=0\ni=2\nAgain if the alm are Gaussian, Fbl1 l2 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) \u2192 \u03b11 \u03b12 (or Fbl1 ...lk (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1k ) \u2192\n\nQk\n\ni=1\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b1i ) and\n\nwe obtain the multivariate empirical process in a similar way as for the univariate process\nn\no\np\nbl1 l2 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = (l1 + 1) Fbl1 l2 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) \u2212 \u03b11 \u03b12 ,\nG\nand\n\nbl1 ...l (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1k ) =\nG\nk\n\np\n\n(\n\n(l1 + 1) Fbl1 ...lk (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1k ) \u2212\n\nk\nY\n\n\u03b1i\n\ni=1\n\n)\n\n.\n\nIn the sequel, it is convenient to write l1 = l and li+1 = l + \u2206li , for some positive and\ndistinct integers 0 < \u2206l1 , \u2206l2 , ..., \u2206l,k\u22121 << L. For 0 \u2264 \u03b11 , \u03b12 \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, we hence\nfocus on\nb L (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , r) = \u221a\nK\n\n1\nL \u2212 \u2206l1\n\n[(L\u2212\u2206l1 )r]\n\nX\nl=1\n\nbl,l+\u2206 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) ,\nG\nl1\n\nAs discussed in Section II using the estimated Cl gives a bias which needs to be corrected\nfor.

Therefore by looking at multiple rows a non-Gaussian feature can\nbe more likely detected.\nBy an argument similar to Section II, it is possible to establish the weak convergence\nb \u2032 (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1k , r) to zero mean Gaussian fields with a complicated covariance function,\nof K\nL\n\nwhich is not reported for brevity's sake. We stress that the limiting distribution changes\n\nwhen we vary the number of rows considered; on the other hand, for L large the effect\nof the spacing factors \u2206l , \u2206m is minimal (in the Gaussian case): hence, at least as a first\napproximation, a single Monte Carlo tabulation is sufficient, given the number of rows\nincluded. The robustness of the limiting result for varying \u2206\u2032 s is further investigated in the\nempirical section.\nIn the previous discussion, we focussed for simplicity on the case where only a single\nspherical harmonic coefficient was selected from any multipole l. This assumption may be\nrelaxed to consider the joint distribution of the spherical harmonic coefficients within the\nsame row l. The limiting form of the bias term is here more complicated, however, due to\nthe dependence among the normalized coefficients u\nblm over the same row l. To evaluate this\n\nbias, we can provide the following general result: for any 0 \u2264 \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1p \u2264 1 such that\n\u2212\n\np\nX\n2 log(1 \u2212 \u03b1i )\ni=1\n\n2l + 1\n\n\u22641,\n\n(a condition which is always fulfilled, provided l is large enough), we have\nh\n\np\nY\ni=1\n\nulmi \u2264 \u03b1i )i =\n1(b\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)#(\u03b3) 1 +\n\nX 2 log(1 \u2212 \u03b1j )\nj\u2208\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\u2208\u0393p\n\n2l + 1\n\n!l\u22121/2\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u0393p is the class of all 2p subsets \u03b3 of {1, 2, ..., p} , and #(\u03b3) denotes the number of\nelements in \u03b3.

First we will use\na non-Gaussianity generated in spherical harmonic space which should be easily detected\nas our method is based on the spherical harmonic coefficients. In the second class of test\nmodels we will generate the non-Gaussianity in pixel space . For these models we expect a\ndrop in the detection level at least for the univariate test, as the transformation to spherical\nharmonic space may make the spherical harmonic coefficients more Gaussian using a central\nlimit theorem argument.\nTo generate a sequence of non-Gaussian alm , we consider first the same model as in\nRef.[30],i.e.\nG\nR\nI\naN\nlm = alm + ialm ,\nI\n2\nwhere aR\nlm , alm are independent \u03c7\u03bd variables, normalized to have zero mean and the same\n\nangular power spectrum as the Gaussian part of the model.\nOur field is then defined as (Model 1)\nT (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\nalm =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\nalm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\nl=1 m=\u2212l\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)aG\nlm\n\nG\n+ \u03b2aN\nlm .\n\n\b\n\b NG\nNote that aG\nare independent and have by construction an identical angular\nlm and alm\npower spectrum; the percentage of non-Gaussianity in the model is then uniquely determined\nas\nfN G =\n\n\u03b22\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 + \u03b2 2\n13\n\n(17)\n\n\fFIG. 1: The Kmax (univariate) from a Monte Carlo simulation of 500 Gaussian CMB realizations.\nThe colored areas indicate the Kmax intervals where 68%, 95% and 99% of the Gaussian realizations\nare found. If Kmax is found in one of these intervals, this is taken as a 1, 2 and 3 sigma detection\nof non-Gaussianity respectively.\n\nNeedless to say, this toy model is unphysical, but it is helpful to illustrate some characteristics\nof our approach. Note the bispectrum Blm1 l12ml32 m3 = hal1 m1 al2 m2 al3 m3 i here is identically zero,\nunless m1 = m2 = m3 = 0; hence the selection rules implied by Wigner's 3j coefficients\nare not satisfied and the model is (slightly) anisotropic. We do not view this as a major\ndifficulty, however, as the effect is minimal and this model is introduced here for purely\nexpository purposes.\nWe consider Komogorov-Smirnov type tests as discussed in the previous sections, with\na straightforward extension to the multivariate case. We evaluate the distribution of Kmax\nwhich is the sup of the K\u0302L\u2032 (\u03b1, r) function (see equations 9, 14, 15) using Monte Carlo\n14\n\n\fFIG. 2: The Kmax (bivariate) from a Monte Carlo simulation of 500 Gaussian CMB realizations.\nThe colored areas indicate the Kmax intervals where 68%, 95% and 99% of the Gaussian realizations\nare found.

In figures (1), (2) and (3) we show the results\nfor the uni-, bi- and trivariate case. We now define the 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 detection levels as the\nKmax values over which we had 68%, 95% and 99% of the hits in the Gaussian simulations\nrespectively. These detection levels are shown as shades in the figures. We consider the\nresolution L = 500; to approximate the suprema, we choose a grid of 30 points over the \u03b1space, which makes the numerical implementation of our Monte Carlo procedures extremely\nfast. We have some evidence, however, that our results may be to some extent improved for\nfiner grids.\nThe results are reported in Tables I, II and III. We considered the univariate test\n15\n\n\fFIG. 3: The Kmax (trivariate) from a Monte Carlo simulation of 100 Gaussian CMB realizations.\nThe colored areas indicate the Kmax intervals where 68%, 95% and 99% of the Gaussian realizations\nare found. If Kmax is found in one of these intervals, this is taken as a 1, 2 and 3 sigma detection\nof non-Gaussianity respectively.\n\ndescribed in Section II, and then the multivariate version of Section III; for the latter,\nwe focussed on bivariate and trivariate circumstances, with \u2206l = 250, \u2206m = 0 and\n\u2206l1 = \u2206m1 = 249, \u2206l2 = \u2206m2 = 250, respectively (see eq.12). For this model, the\nperformance of the three procedures is certainly very satisfactory. The power of the tests,\ni.e. the percentage of simulations where non-Gaussianity is correctly detected is a monotonic\nfunction of \u03b2 (the amount of non-Gaussianity) as expected. For instance for the univariate\ntest that can consistently detect as little as 6% non-Gaussianity in the map, at the 2\u03c3 level.\nA map of a model with 6% non-Gaussian distributions are shown in figure (4) and its histogram in figure (5). In pixel space this model seems to be almost identical to a Gaussian\n16\n\n\fFIG. 4: A Gaussian map (monopole and dipole removed) with a 5.9% non-Gaussian part, made\nwith \u03c72 distributed alm\n\nmodel.\nAs a second alternative (Model 2), we try to mimic cosmic string models by generating 104 string-like features with randomly(Gaussian) varying length and temperature and\nsuperimposing them on a Gaussian background, according to the expression\nT (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1 \u2212 \u03b2)T G (\u03b8, \u03c6) + \u03b2T S (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere T S (\u03b8, \u03c6) is a pure string map, T G (\u03b8, \u03c6) is a Gaussian CMB map. The two fields are\nindependent. The percentage of non-Gaussianity, fN G , is again defined by (17). We view\n(18) as a model where non-Gaussianity is strong in pixel space, and we thus expect our\nresults not to be as good as for the previous example. An inspection of the Tables IV\u2013VIII,\nsuggests that the performance of the univariate test gives weaker results than what was the\ncase for the non-Gaussianity generated in spherical harmonic space: at least 30% of nonGaussianity is needed to ensure a mere 50% detections at 1\u03c3. However, the performance of\nthe bivariate and trivariate procedures is more promising, as non-Gaussianity can be detected\nfor percentage of non-Gaussianity around 10/15% at the 1\u03c3 level. The effect of varying \u2206m\nis noticeable, but not extraordinary; likewise, some unreported simulations for other values\nof \u2206l (=200,150,100) show similar outcomes (on the other hand, the performance is worse\n17\n\n\fFIG. 5: The histogram of the pixels of a Gaussian map with a 5.9% non-Gaussian part, made with\n\u03c72 distributed alm .

The map is\nlooking Gaussian except for a few strong out-layers which is seen as a tail in the histogram\n(Figure (7)). This map is at the limit of the 2\u03c3 detection level (for detection in 50% of the\ncases) for our tests, but it seems that a test in pixel space may here give a stronger detection\nif the out-layers are not misinterpreted as foregrounds or noise.\n\n18\n\n\fFIG. 6: A Gaussian map (monopole and dipole removed) with a 15.5% non-Gaussian part, made of\nstring like objects of varying length and temperature.

Furthermore, our analysis of the distributional properties of the\nspherical harmonic coefficients may have some independent interest in other areas of CMB\ninvestigation.\nOur approach is clearly related to the analysis of higher-order cumulant spectra (such\nas the bispectrum and trispectrum) in harmonic space. Although the bi- and trispectrum\nhave been very widely used in empirical work, their power properties against a variety of\nnon-Gaussian models do not seem to have been very much investigated. We conjecture that\nour procedure may enjoy better power properties than higher order spectra in a number of\ncircumstances; heuristically, the bispectrum and the trispectrum search for non-Gaussian\nfeatures on the alm by focusing essentially on their skewness and kurtosis, whereas the\nmethod we advocate here probe their whole multivariate distribution. The mutual interplay\nbetween these different methodologies may lead to improvements in both directions: for\ninstance, it seems possible to model the bispectrum and trispectrum evaluated at different\nmultipoles as processes indexed by some r, much the same way as we did here to combine\nthe information from empirical processes Gl1 ...lk into a single statistic KL . This may allow\nfor a more rigorous analysis in the aggregate, in order to understand whether a single or a\n22\n\n\ffew high values are to be considered significant, over a set of L statistics. On the other hand,\nincorporation of some selection rules (e.g., the Wigner's 3j coefficients) into our analysis may\nhelp us to exploit the isotropic nature of the field to probe non-Gaussianity more efficiently.\nIn this paper we have tested the method for two non-Gaussian models. One which was\ncreated in spherical harmonic space and the other which was created in pixel space. For\nthe first model, we detect non\u2013Gaussianity at a 2\u03c3 level (about 50% of the times) with\nthe univariate test even when the test model contains only 5.9% non-Gaussianity. In this\ncase the map is very similar to a Gaussian map. Our second non-Gaussian test model was\ngenerated in pixel space. In this case we had 2\u03c3 detections (about 50% of the times) with\n15.5% non-Gaussianity. The map shows that this kind of non-Gaussianity may be more\neasily detected in pixel space. When taking into account realistic effects like detector noise\nand galactic cuts, the method has so far shown promising results. This will be discussed\nfurther together with tests on realistic non-Gaussian maps in [31].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge the use of the Healpix package[35].\n\n[1] J. V. Narlikar and T.
