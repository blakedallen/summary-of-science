We quantize parabolic flag manifolds and describe categories of quantum Dmodules on them at a singular central character. We compute global sections of generators\nfor these categories for any q \u2208 C\u2217 . For generic q we prove a singular version of BeilinsonBernstein localization for a quantized enveloping algebra.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. This note is part of our ongoing project on localization and representation theory of\nquantum groups. Localization theory starts with the celebrated localization theorem of Beilinson and Bernstein, [BB81], which we remind goes as follows: Let g be a complex semi-simple\nLie algebra, h a Cartan subalgebra and B the flag manifold of g. Let \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217 be regular and\ndominant and let I\u03bb be the corresponding maximal ideal in the center of U(g). Let DB\u03bb be\n\u03bb\nthe sheaf of \u03bb-twisted differential operators on B. Then \u0393(DB\u03bb ) \u223c\n= U(g) := U(g) /(I\u03bb ) and\n\u0393 : Mod(DB\u03bb ) \u2192 Mod(U(g)\u03bb ) is an equivalence of categories. For applications and details we\nrecommend the book [HTT08].\nThe next fundamental step was taken by Bezrukavnikov, Mirkovi\u0107 and Rumynin, [BMR08].\nThey did Beilinson-Bernstein localization in finite characteristic at regular central character\nand later in [BMR06] at singular central character, at the level of derived categories, utilizing\nthe techniques of Azumaya algebras.\nThe authors did localization for a quantum group Uq := Uq (g) at a generic q \u2208 C\u2217 in\n[BK06] and at a root of unity in [BK08] - in both papers for regular central character, in the\nlatter motivated by the ideas of [BMR08]. In [BK10] we also did localization for the complex\nenveloping algebra case at a singular central character.\n1.2. In this paper we do singular localization for Uq at a generic q. Let us sketch the basic\nideas:\nWe shall merely assume that g is reductive and let G be a reductive group such that\nLie G = g. Let P \u2286 G be a parabolic subgroup and let P = G/P be the corresponding\nparabolic flag manifold. First we quantize P the same way as we quantized B in [BK06]. We\nremind that this is done as follows: Observe that the category Mod(OP ) of quasi-coherent\nsheaves on P is equivalent to the category Mod(O(G), P ) of P -equivariant O(G)-modules,\nsince G is affine. Since an algebraic P -action is the same thing as an O(P )-coaction the latter\ncategory admits a quantization.\nIndeed, let Oq := Oq (G) and Oq (P ) be the quantized Hopf algebras of functions on G\nand P , respectively, and let Mod(Oq , Pq ) be the category whose objects are Oq -modules and\nOq (P )-comodules with a certain equivariance compatibility, see Section 3.1. According to\nGrothendieck a space is the same thing as its category of sheaves, so we think of Mod(Oq , Pq )\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In Proposition 3.3 we give a quantum counterpart to\nSerre's description of projective varieties.\nThen we fix a weight \u03bb and chose P such that the singular roots of \u03bb are contained\n\u03bb of certain extended differentials\nin the P -parabolic roots. [BMR06] considered a sheaf DP\noperators in characteristic p on P that locally looks like DP tensored with the primitive\nquotient determined by \u03bb of the enveloping algebra of the Levi-factor l of p := Lie P . In\n[BK10] we considered the same sheaf in characteristic 0.\n\u03bb ) in Section 4.2. As in our earlier work we have to work\nWe quantize the category Mod(DP\nwith ad-finite (here called ad-integrable) versions of Uq ; a novelty is that we use a different\nad-finite version Ul-q int \u2286 Uq for each parabolic. In Theorem 4.1 we compute global sections\nof the distinguished object Dql-int that represents global sections (morally, this is the sheaf of\nquantum differential operators on P). This result is valid for all q (except perhaps roots of\nunity of order smaller than the Coxeter number of g). The proof reduces to P = B in which\ncase the result was established in [BK06, BK08]; a short self-contained proof was given in\n[BK11].\nAnother result of independent interest, valid for all q, is the parabolic triangular decomposition, Proposition-Definition 6.3, that we deduce from the Majid-Radford theorem. (For\ngeneric q this was done in [G11].)\nOur main result, which holds for generic q, is a version of Beilinson-Bernstein localization,\nTheorem 5.1. The proof is close to that given in [BK10], which in turn is a variation of the\nargument of [BB81].\nT. Tanisaki [T05, T12] has a different approach to quantum localization in the regular\ncase. His approach follows on from the work of Lunts and Rosenberg [LR97, LR99]. In this\napproach quantum flag varieties are defined as non-commutative projective varieties using\ngraded algebras. Differential operators are defined using graded algebras as well. In [BK06]\nwe show that the graded algebra approach (on the level of quasi-coherent sheaves) is equivalent\nto our equivariant approach. This result should also extend to D-modules. Hence the two\napproaches are essentially equivalent. The equivariant approach is more geometric since it\nviews quantum spaces as quotient spaces. This allows for easy reductions of the problems\ninto questions in the representation theory of quantum groups. Tanisaki proves a BeilinsonBernstein localization theorem for quantum groups at regular central character for generic q\nequivalent to our result in [BK06].\n1.3. In a forthcoming paper we will do singular localization at a root of unity. Those results\nhere which are valued for all q will be needed in that paper. Just as in the modular case\n(regular and singular) Beilinson-Bernstein localization will then only hold at the level of\nderived categories. This is the most interesting case and we shall use this and the results of\n[BMR08, BMR06, BM10] to compare the representation theory of Uq with the representation\ntheory of the Lie algebra g(Fp ), when q p = 1.\nConcerning other applications, let us mention that we in [BK10] used singular localization\nto describe translation functors, singular blocks in the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category\nO, Harish Chandra (bi-)modules and Whittaker modules in the enveloping algebra case.\nExactly the same can be done for the generic quantum group, with practically exactly the\nsame arguments. We have omitted to write this down.\n1.4. We advise the reader to read [BK10] before this article. That paper was written with\nthis one in mind and the geometric ideas behind the equivariant definitions given here are there\n\n\fSINGULAR LOCALIZATION FOR QUANTUM GROUPS AT GENERIC q.\n\n3\n\nthoroughly explained. Quantum groups are technically harder to work with than enveloping\nalgebras in the context of localization theory because, for instance, the adjoint action of\nUq on itself is not integrable (see Section 2.6) and PBW-bases and (parabolic) triangular\ndecompositions are more complicated.\nHowever, once those technical complications are overcome the conceptual distance between\nthe generic quantum group and the complex enveloping algebra case is small.\n1.5.

Preliminaries on quantum groups\nWe work over C, \u2297 = \u2297C . t is a parameter and q denotes a complex invertible number\nsuch that q 2 6= 1. We say that q is generic if q is not a root of unity.\nMod(S) denotes the category of left modules over a ring S, Mod(S, additional data) is the\ncategory whose objects are left S-modules with some additional data.\nIn this section we recall some facts about quantum groups. The material here is mostly\nstandard. This paper is a continuation of the papers [BK06, BK08]. Let us mention that\nwe shall not particularly follow the notations of those papers, but rather \"quantize\" those of\n[BK10].\n[CP95] is our main reference for the material here. See also Section 6.1 for some facts about\nHopf algebras that will be used here.\n2.1. Root data. Let g be a reductive Lie algebra and let h \u2286 b \u2286 g be a Cartan subalgebra\ncontained in a Borel subalgebra. Let n \u2282 b be the unipotent radical. Let b be the opposite\nBorel and n its unipotent radical. We denote by U(g) the enveloping algebra of g and by Z(g)\nthe center of U(g).\nLet \u2206 be the simple roots, let \u039b be the lattice of integral weights and let \u039br be the root\nlattice. Let \u039b+ and \u039br+ be the positive weights and the positive integral linear combinations\nof the simple roots, respectively.\nLet W be the Weyl group of g. We let h , i denote a W-invariant bilinear form on h\u22c6\nnormalized by h\u03b3, \u03b3i = 2 for each short root \u03b3.\nLet T\u039b := Homgroups (\u039b, C\u22c6 ) = M axspec C\u039b be the character group of \u039b, where C\u039b is the\ngroup algebra of \u039b. The W-action on \u039b induces a W-action on T\u039b . We define the \u2022-action of\nW on T\u039b by w \u2022 \u03bb = w(\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1, where \u03c1 is the half sum of the positive roots. For \u03bc \u2208 \u039b we\ndefine q \u03bc \u2208 T\u039b by the formula q \u03bc (\u03b3) = q h\u03bc,\u03b3i , for \u03b3 \u2208 \u039b. For any \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206, put d\u03b1 := h\u03b1, \u03b1i/2.\nLet G be a connected reductive algebraic group such that G/Z(G) is simply connected\n(where Z(G) is the center of G) and Lie G = g. Let B be the Borel subgroup of G with\nLie B = b. Let P \u2287 B be a parabolic subgroup of G and let p = Lie P . Let R be the\nunipotent radical and let L be the Levi-factor of P and denote by r and l their respective Lie\nalgebras. Let \u2206P \u2286 \u2206 be the P -parabolic roots (so \u2206B = \u2205, \u2206G = \u2206). Write P , R, p and r\nfor their respective opposite groups and Lie algebras.\nLet \u03bb \u2208 T\u039b and put \u2206\u03bb = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206; s\u03b1 \u2022 \u03bb = \u03bb}. We say that\n\u2022 \u03bb is P -regular if \u2206\u03bb \u2286 \u2206P . \u03bb is regular if it is B-regular, i.e. if Stab(W,\u2022) (\u03bb) = {e}.\n\u2022 \u03bb is a P -character if \u03bb is integral and \u03bb(K\u03b1 ) = 1, for \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206P .\n2.2.

Put q\u03b1 = q \u03b1 .\nLet Uq := Uq (g) be the simply connected quantized enveloping algebra of g. Recall that\nUq has C-algebra generators E\u03b1 , F\u03b1 , K\u03bc , for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 and \u03bc \u2208 \u039b.

We have\n\u25b3K\u03bc = K\u03bc \u2297 K\u03bc , \u25b3E\u03b1 = K\u03b1 \u2297 E\u03b1 + E\u03b1 \u2297 1, \u25b3F\u03b1 = 1 \u2297 F\u03b1 + F\u03b1 \u2297 K\u2212\u03b1\nS(K\u03bc ) = K\u2212\u03bc , S(E\u03b1 ) = \u2212K\u2212\u03b1 E\u03b1 , S(F\u03b1 ) = \u2212F\u03b1 K\u03b1\n\u01eb(K\u03bc ) = 1, \u01eb(E\u03b1 ) = \u01eb(F\u03b1 ) = 0\n2.2.2. Let Oq = Oq (G) be the algebra of matrix coefficients of finite dimensional type-1\nrepresentations of Uq . This is a quantization of the algebra of functions O(G) on G. There\nis a natural pairing h , i : Uq \u2297Oq \u2192 C. This gives a Uq -bimodule structure on Oq as follows\n(2.1)\n\n\u03bcl (u)(a) := ua := a1 hu, a2 i, \u03bcr (u)(a) := au := hu, a1 ia2 , u \u2208 Uq , a \u2208 Oq\n\nso that \u03bcl is a left action and \u03bcr is a right action. Then Oq is the (restricted) dual of Uq\nwith respect to this pairing. Quantizing the enveloping algebras U(p) and U(l) gives Hopf\nsubalgebras of Uq :\nUq (p) = ChK\u03bc , E\u03b1 , F\u03b2 ; \u03bc \u2208 \u039b, \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206P i and\nUq (l) = ChK\u03bc , E\u03b1 , F\u03b2 ; \u03bc \u2208 \u039b, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206P i\nIn particular, Uq (h) is isomorphic to the group algebra C\u039b.\nThere is the counit \u01eb : Uq \u2192 C.

Note that VLq (\u03bb) := VPq (\u03bb) is an irreducible\nrepresentation for Lq . Of course, dim VPq (\u03bb) = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bb is a Pq -character.\n2.3.4. Let P \u2286 Q be parabolic subgroups of G and let L\u2032 be the Levi factor of Q. We state\nfor the record\nL\u2032\n\nLemma 2.1.

We then define \u03c4 (f \u2297 m) = p(f ) \u2297 m, for f \u2297 m \u2208 IndPqq (M ). It is\nstraightforward to verify that this is an isomorphism. The Qq -action on the right hand side\nis now defined by transportation of structure.\n\u0003\n2.4. The center of Uq and the Harish-Chandra homomorphism.\n2.4.1. Let Z(A) denote the center of an algebra A. Put Z = Z(Uq ). Then Z contains the\nHarish-Chandra center Z HC and, if q is a primitive l'th root of unity, Z also contains the\nl-center Z (l) , which is generated by E\u03b1l , F\u03b1l and K\u03bcl , \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206, \u03bc \u2208 \u039b.\nLet us now describe Z HC . Let \u0393 be the group of all group homomorphisms from \u039b to {\u00b1}.\nThus \u0393 = h\u03c3\u03b1 ; \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206i, where \u03c3\u03b1 (\u03c9\u03b2 ) = (\u22121)\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 and the \u03c9\u03b2 's are the fundamental weights,\n\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206. \u0393 has a natural action of W, so we can form W\u0303 := \u0393 \u22ca W. We consider the following\naction of W\u0303 on C\u039b: the subgroup W act by the \u2022-action and \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 act by \u03c3(K\u03bb ) = \u03c3(\u03bb)K\u03bb ,\nfor \u03bb \u2208 \u039b. Let C\u039bW\u0303 be the invariant ring. Observe that C\u039b\u0393 = C2\u039b so that C\u039bW\u0303 = C2\u039bW .\nThere is the Harish-Chandra isomorphism\n\u223c\n\n\u03c7 : Z HC \u2212\u2192 C\u039bW\u0303\nFor \u03bb \u2208 T\u039b let \u03c7\u03bb : Z HC \u2192 C be the corresponding central character. This construction is\nstandard when g is semi-simple. Our reductive g can be written as a direct sum of Lie algebras:\ng = [g, g] \u2295 Zg , where Zg is the center of g and [g, g] is semi-simple. Thus, Zg \u2282 h and we have\nUq = Uq ([g, g])\u2297Uq (Zg ) (where Uq (Zg ) \u2282 C\u039b). The Harish-Chandra homomorphism \u03c7 for Uq\n\n\fERIK BACKELIN AND KOBI KREMNIZER ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION IN ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS\n6\n\ncan thus be described as the product \u03c7 = \u03c7[g,g] \u2297 IdUq (Zg ) , where \u03c7[g,g] is the Harish-Chandra\nisomorphism for the quantum group Uq ([g, g]).\nIf q is an l'th root of unity we have Z = Z HC \u2297Z (l) \u2229Z HC Z (l) and if q is not a root of unity\nwe have Z = Z HC .\nNote that to describe Z HC (Uq (l)) we should consider W\u0303P = \u0393P \u22ca WP where \u0393P = h\u03c3\u03b1 ; \u03b1 \u2208\n\u2206P i.

Part i) of the following lemma is standard and part ii) is proved in [BK10] for the\nenveloping algebra case and the proof in the generic quantum case is the same.\nLemma 2.2. Assume that q is generic. Let \u03bb \u2208 T\u039b . i) Then \u03bb is dominant iff for all\n\u03bc \u2208 \u039br+ \\ {0} we have \u03c7\u03bb+\u03bc 6= \u03c7\u03bb ,\nii) Let \u03bb be P -regular and dominant. Let \u03bc be a P -character. Then for any \u03c8 \u2208 \u039b(VGq (\u03bc)), \u03c8 6=\n\u03bc, we have \u03c7\u03bb+\u03bc 6= \u03c7\u03bb+\u03c8 .\n2.5. Integral versions of Uq .\n2.5.1. Let t be a parameter and let Ut be the C(t)-algebra defined by the same generators\nas Uq and modulo the relations obtained by substituting t for q in the defining relations\nof Uq . Let A = C[t, t\u22121 ]. Let Ures\nA be Lusztig's integral form of Uq , the A-algebra in Ut\n(n)\n(n)\ngenerated by divided\npowers E\u03b1 = E\u03b1n /[n]d\u03b1 !, F\u03b1 = F\u03b1n /[n]d\u03b1 !, \u03b1 a simple root, n \u2265 1\nQ\nm\n\nq d*s \u2212q \u2212d*s\n\n) and the K\u03bc 's, \u03bc \u2208 P .

For a generic q we have Uq (p) = Uq (p).\n2.6. Integrable part of Uq .\n\n2.6.1. Integrability of modules. A (say right) Ures\nq (l)-module M is called integrable if there is\nan Lq -module structure on it such that um = hu, m1 im2 , for u \u2208 Ures\nq (l), m \u2208 M , m1 \u2297 m2 is\nthe coaction on m and h , i : Ures\n(l)\n\u2297\nO\n(L)\n\u2192\nC\nis\nthe\nnatural\npairing.\nFor q generic M is\nq\nq\nintegrable iff the Ures\n(l)-action\nis\nlocally\nfinite\nand\nthe\nK\n's\nact\nby\ninteger\neigenvalues.

(On the other hand, an Lq -module structure always differentiates to a\nUq (l)-module structure.)\ng-int\nWe write Uint\nand M int := M g-int , if M is a Ures\nq := Uq\nq -module.\n\n\fSINGULAR LOCALIZATION FOR QUANTUM GROUPS AT GENERIC q.\n\n7\n\n2.6.2. Ul-q int is a subalgebra and a left coideal in Uq , i.e. \u25b3 Ul-q int \u2282 Ul-q int \u2297 Uq (but it is not\na Hopf algebra).\nUint\nq was first systematically studied in [JL92]. (They called it the \"ad-finite\" subalgebra,\nbut since this is misleading at a root of unity we prefer the name \"ad-integrable\". In [BK06,\nBK08] we also called it Ufq in instead of Uint\nq .) Let \u03c9i and \u03b1i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r := rank g, be the\nfundamental weights and the simple roots, respectively. To give the reader a feeling for Uint\nq\nwe state:\nint\nLemma 2.3. i) K2\u03c9i , K2\u03c9i \u2212\u03b1i E\u03b1i and K2\u03c9i F\u03b1i \u2208 Uint\nq . ii) Uq \u2297Uint \u2229C\u039b C\u039b = Uq .\nq\n\nProof. A computation (inside UA ) shows that\nad2r (E\u03b1i )(K2\u03c9i ) = adr (E\u03b1j )(K2\u03c9i ) = ad2r (F\u03b1i )(K2\u03c9i ) = adr (F\u03b1j )(K2\u03c9i ) = 0, i 6= j.\nAn application of the PBW-theorem shows that this implies that K2\u03c9i \u2208 Uint\nq , for all i. Since\nK2\u03c9i \u2212\u03b1i E\u03b1i \u223c adr (E\u03b1i )(K2\u03c9i ) and K2\u03c9i F\u03b1i \u223c adr (F\u03b1i )(K2\u03c9i ) (where \u223c means equal up to a\nnon-zero scalar) we have proved i). ii) follows from i).\n\u0003\nHC (Uint ) := Z HC (U ) be the Harish-Chandra center of\nWe have Z HC (Uq ) \u2286 Uint\nq\nq . Let Z\nq\nint\nint\n(l)\nUq . On the other hand Z (Uq ) * Uq , for q an l'th root of unity.\n\nExample 2.4. Let Uq (sl2 ) = ChE, F, K, K \u22121 i, where KEK \u22121 = qK, KF K \u22121 = q \u22121 F and\n2 +q \u22121 K \u22122\n2 \u2212K \u22122\nThen Uq (sl2 )int = ChK 2 F, K 2 , E, zi, where z = qK(q\u2212q\n+ FE \u2208\n[E, F ] = Kq\u2212q\n\u22121 .\n\u22121 )2\nint\n2\n\u22121\nZ(Uq (sl2 )) is the Casimir operator. Thus Uq \u2229C\u039b = C[K ] and C\u039b = C[K, K ].\nAnother important feature is that, contrary to Uq , Uint\nq is free over its Harish-Chandra\ncenter, except possibly for a finite set of roots of unity, see [JL92, B00, BK11]. This freeness\nproperty holds only for the simply connected version of Uq which is a main reason we work\nwith that version.\nWe are primary interested in the representation theory of Uq , but it will be Uint\nq that occurs\nnaturally as global sections, see Theorem 4.1. However, we remark that the representation\ntheories of Uq and Uint\nq are very similar. This will be precisely explained in the next section.\nFollowing [JL94] we define\nDefinition 2.5. Let \u03bb \u2208 T\u039b . Put U\u03bbq := Uint\nq /(Ker \u03c7\u03bb ).\n\u03bb\nThe right Gq -action on Uint\nq , resp. on Uq , that is obtained by integrating adr (Uq ) is called\nthe right adjoint Gq -action and again denoted by adr .\n\nRemark 2.6. There was a misprint in the paper [BK06] which unfortunately, partly, moved\non to [BK08]; there we defined U\u03bbq to be Uint\n(M\u03bb ). At a generic q this is the same\nq /AnnUint\nq\nas the correct definition 2.5 given here but at a root of unity it is wrong.\n2.7. Verma modules and universal Verma modules.\n2.7.1.

It is sometimes a subtle issue which version of the quantum group one should use,\ni.e. which functions on the tori one should include. We have chosen to work with the simply\nconnected version - because it is free over Z HC - but note that all versions of Uq have the\nsame Verma modules, as sets, and that they are parameterized by the spectra of the torus\npart of the quantum group in question.\nfPq := Ul-q int / Ul-q int * Uq (r)>0 be a \"Pq -universal\" Verma module for\nDefinition 2.8.

The case P = B was dealt with in [BK06]. We shall reduce to that case.\n(1) Let \u03bb \u2208 \u039b+ be a Pq -character. We must prove that R>0 \u0393(OPq (\u03bb)) = 0. By the tensor\nG\nidentity we have R\u0393(OPq (\u03bb)) = Oq \u2297 RIndPqq (C\u2212\u03bb ); hence, it is enough to prove the Kempf\nvanishing\nG\n\nR>0 IndPqq (C\u2212\u03bb ) = 0.\n\n(3.3)\n\nBy [APW91], 3.3 holds for P = B (and any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b+ ).

Since L\u2229B is\nq\n\nP\n\na Borel subgroup of the reductive group L, [APW91] applies again, so we get RIndBqq (C\u2212\u03bb ) =\nP\n\nP\n\nIndBqq (C\u2212\u03bb ). Since \u03bb = 0 on \u2206P it is clear that IndBqq (C\u2212\u03bb ) = C\u2212\u03bb .

Algebras of differential operators on Gq .\n4.1.1. The construction given here is a version of the Heisenberg double, see [M93]. Recall\nthe actions \u03bcl and \u03bcr of Uq on Oq from 2.1, the left and right adjoints action adl and adr of\nUq on itself. In [BK06] we defined the ring of differential operators Dq on Gq to be the smash\nproduct Dq := Oq # Uq with respect to the action \u03bcl .\nBoth the algebras Oq \u2297 Uq and Dq are right Uq -module algebras with respect to the action\n\u03bcr on Oq and the action adr on Uq . We shall refer to these actions as the right adjoint actions\nof Uq on Oq \u2297 Uq and on Dq , respectively, and denote them by adr .\nThe algebra Dq is suitable in relation to equivariant sheaves of differential operators on Bq ,\nbut it turns out that for each parabolic P it is better to use a different version of it (see\nRemark 4.4). Since Ul-q int is a left coideal in Uq we can define subalgebras of Dq by\nDefinition 4.1. Let Dql-int = Oq # Ul-q int .\nObserve that this coincide with our earlier definition: Dql-int = adr (Uq (l))-integrable part\nof Dq . Note that Dql-int = Dq \u21d0\u21d2 l = h. We write Dqint = Dqg-int . Dql-int is a Uq -submodule\nalgebra of Dq .\nThe action adr |Uint integrates to an action\nq\n\nint\ncoad : Uint\nq \u2192 Oq \u2297 Uq .\n\nThis makes Uint\nq an Oq -comodule algebra, i.e. coad is an algebra homomorphism. From the\nint Gq\nint\n\u223c\ntensor identity we have Uint\nq = coad(Uq ) = (Oq \u2297 Uq ) . coad is however not the embedding\nthat we are primary interested in.

It follows from [M93] that \u01ebl is an algebra embedding.\n\n\u0003\n\nObserve that the \u01ebl does not extend to an embedding Ul-q int \u2192 Dq , unless l = g.\nThere is also the left adjoint action of Uq on Dq . This action commutes with the right adjoint\naction and is defined by taking the action \u03bcl on Oq and the trivial Uq -action on itself. We\ndenote this action by adl . It integrates to a Gq -action. It restricts to a Gq -action on Dql-int .\nWe get the embedding\n\u01ebr : Ul-q int \u223c\n= 1# Ul-q int \u0592\u2192 Dql-int .\nThus \u01ebr (Ul-q int ) = Gq Dql-int , equal the space of invariants for the left adjoint Gq -action.

Morphisms are Dql-int -linear and Pq -linear maps. We define the global section\nfunctor \u0393 on this category to be the functor of taking Pq -invariants. Recall the Pq -universal\nfPq from Section 2.7. Let\nVerma module M\nePq := Oq \u2297 \u01ebr (M\nfPq ) \u2208 Mod(Dql-int , Pq , Uq (r)).\nD\nePq represents the global section functor on this category.\nObserve that D\nRemarks 4.4. A) It is enough to verify condition (3) on a set of Dql-int -module generators of M .\nThe reason for this is that Uq (r) is a left coideal. Indeed, if m \u2208 M satisfy d\u03c1(x)m = \u01ebr (x)m\nfor all x \u2208 Uq (r), then for y \u2208 Dql-int we also have\nd\u03c1(x)(ym) = adr (x2 )(y)d\u03c1(x1 )m = adr (x2 )(y)\u01ebr (x1 )m = \u01ebr (x)(ym)\nsince x1 \u2208 Uq (r). This implies that if M satifies (1) and (2) it has a maximal subobject\nM \u2032 := {m \u2208 M ; d\u03c1(x)m = \u01ebr (x)m, x \u2208 Uq (r), m \u2208 M } and a maximal quotient object\n\u2032\u2032\nM := M/(Dql-int * {d\u03c1(x)m \u2212 \u01ebr (x)m, x \u2208 Uq (r), m \u2208 M }) that satisfy (1) \u2212 (3).\n1Recall that in classical Lie theory differentiating the left action of G on itself gives an embedding of g into\nright invariant vector fields on G.\n\n\fSINGULAR LOCALIZATION FOR QUANTUM GROUPS AT GENERIC q.\n\n13\n\nB) The principal reason why we work with Uq (l)-integrable differential operators, rather than\nUq -integrable ones, is the existence of the parabolic triangular decomposition of Corollary\nfPq and hence that of D\nePq .\n6.4, which is crucial to understand the structure of M\nThus, by Remark 6.5 C), we must in the case p = b use the full algebra Dq .

Essentially taken from [BB81]. Since \u0393(DP\nq\nq\ncategory, the theorem will follow from the following two claims:\na) Let \u03bb be dominant. Then \u0393 : Mod\u03bb (Dql-int , Pq , Uq (r)) \u2192 Mod(U\u03bbq ) is exact.\nb) Let \u03bb be dominant and P -regular and M \u2208 Mod\u03bb (Dql-int , Pq , Uq (r)), then, if \u0393(M ) = 0,\nit follows that M = 0.\nLet V be a finite dimensional irreducible Gq -module and let\n\n0 = V\u22121 \u2282 V0 \u2282 . . . \u2282 Vn = V\nbe a filtration of V by Pq -submodules, such that Vi /Vi\u22121 \u223c\n= VP (\u03bci ) is an irreducible Pq -module.\nM \u2297 V is a sheaf, i.e. an object of Mod(Oq , Pq ), equipped with the diagonal Uq -action. Recall\nthat M \u2297 VP (\u03bci ) \u2208 Mod(Dql-int , Pq , Uq (r)).\nAssume that the highest weight \u03bc0 of V is a Pq -character. Then V0 = VPq (\u03bc0 ) = C\u03bc0 and\nwe have M \u2297 V0 = M (\u2212\u03bc0 ) (see Section 3.2 for these notations). Thus we get an embedding\nM (\u2212\u03bc0 ) \u0592\u2192 M \u2297 V , which twists to the embedding\nM \u0592\u2192 (M \u2297 V )(\u03bc0 ) \u223c\n= M dim V (\u03bc0 ) = M (\u03bc0 )dim V .\nNow, by Lemmas 2.2 i), 4.7 and Theorem 4.1 iii) we get that this inclusion splits on derived\nglobal sections, so R\u0393(M ) is a direct summand of R\u0393(M (\u03bc0 ))dim V . Now, for \u03bc0 big enough\nand M Oq -coherent we have R>0 \u0393(M (\u03bc0 )) = 0, by Proposition 3.3. Hence, R>0 \u0393(M ) = 0 in\nthis case. A general M is the union of coherent submodules and by a standard limit-argument\nit follows that R>0 \u0393(M ) = 0. This proves a).\nNow, for b) we assume instead that the lowest weight \u03bcn of V is a P -character. Then we\nhave a surjection M dim V \u223c\n= M \u2297 V \u2192 M (\u2212\u03bcn ). Applying global sections and using Lemmas\n2.2 ii), 4.7 and Theorem 4.1 iv) we get that \u0393(M (\u2212\u03bcn )) is a direct summand of \u0393(M )dim V .\nFor \u03bcn small enough we get that \u0393(M (\u2212\u03bcn )) 6= 0. Hence, \u0393(M ) 6= 0. This proves b).\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.2.

Hopf algebras.\n6.1.1. For general information we refer to [M93]. Let H be a Hopf algebra over a commutative\nring. We denote by \u03bc, \u25b3, S, \u03b9 and \u01eb the product, coproduct, antipode, unit and counit,\nrespectively, on H. We shall use Sweedler's notation and write \u25b3x = x1 \u2297x2 for the coproduct\nof x \u2208 H.\nIf M is a right H-comodule we denote by \u25b3 : M \u2192 M \u2297 H the coaction and write\n\u25b3m = m1 \u2297 x2 , for m \u2208 M . If N is another right H-comodule we have the diagonal coaction\nof H on M \u2297 N defined as the composition\n\u25b3\u2297\u25b3\n\nF\n\n1\u2297\u03bc\n\n23\nM \u2297 N \u2212\u2192 (M \u2297 H) \u2297 (N \u2297 H) \u2212\u2192\n(M \u2297 N ) \u2297 (H \u2297 H) \u2212\u2192 (M \u2297 N ) \u2297 H,\n\nwhere F23 flips the 2'nd and 3'rd tensor.\nLet R be an algebra equipped with a (left) H-module structure. R is called a module algebra\nfor H if x(r*r \u2032 ) = x1 (r)*x2 (r \u2032 ), for x \u2208 H and r, r \u2032 \u2208 R. We can then define the smash-product\nalgebra R#H. As a vector space R#H = R \u2297 H and its associative multiplication is defined\nby\nr \u2297 x * r \u2032 \u2297 x\u2032 = rx1 (r \u2032 ) \u2297 x2 x\u2032 .\n6.1.2. Adjoint action. The left adjoint action adl of H on itself is given by adl (x)(y) =\nx1 yS(x2 ). Similarly, there is the right adjoint action adr of H on itself which is defined by\nadr (x)(y) = S(x1 )yx2 . It makes R a right H-module algebra.\n6.1.3. An untwisting lemma. Assume that H is isomorphic to a Hopf subalgebra of R and\nconsider the action of H on R which is the restriction of the left adjoint action of R on itself.\nThen we have\nLemma 6.1. There is an algebra homomorphism\nf : H \u2192 R#H, f (x) = S(x1 ) \u2297 x2 , x \u2208 H.\n\u223c\n\nMoreover, Im f commutes with R\u2297 1 and f induces an algebra isomorphism 1R \u2297 f : R\u2297 H \u2192\nR#H.\nProof. For the first assertion, let x, y \u2208 H. Then\nf (x) * f (y) = S(x1 ) \u2297 x2 * S(y1 ) \u2297 y2 = S(x1 )adl (x2 )(S(y1 )) \u2297 x3 y2 =\nS(x1 )adl (x2 )(S(y1 )) \u2297 x3 y2 = S(x1 )x2 S(y1 )S(x3 ) \u2297 x4 y2 =\n\u03b9 \u25e6 \u01eb(x1 )S(y1 )S(x2 ) \u2297 x3 y2 = S(y1 )S(x1 ) \u2297 x1 x2 = f (xy).\nFor the second assertion, let r \u2297 1 \u2208 R \u2297 1 and x \u2208 H. Then\nf (x) * r \u2297 1 = S(x1 )adl (x2 )(r) \u2297 x3 = S(x1 )x2 rS(x3 ) \u2297 x4 =\n\u03b9 \u25e6 \u01eb(x1 )rS(x2 ) \u2297 x3 = rS(x1 ) \u2297 x2 = r \u2297 1 * f (x).\nThis implies that 1R \u2297 f is an algebra homomorphism; its inverse is given by\nR#H \u220b r \u2297 x 7\u2192 rx1 \u2297 x2 \u2208 R \u2297 H.\n\u0003\nLet Z(H) denote the center of (the underlying algebra of) H.\n\n\fSINGULAR LOCALIZATION FOR QUANTUM GROUPS AT GENERIC q.\n\n19\n\nCorollary 6.2. f induces an algebra embedding f : Z(H) \u2192 Z(R#H). 1 \u2297 f induces\n\u223c\nan isomorphism Z(R) \u2297 Z(H) \u2192 Z(R#H). In particular, if Z(R) = C, then f is an\nisomorphism.\n6.2. Quantizing U(r). A canonical quantization Uq (r) was defined in [G11]. The following\nproperties of it was proved in [G11] for a generic q. We shall prove them for any q by modifying\nhis methods.\nProposition-Definition 6.3. There are subalgebras Uq (r) \u2286 Uq (b) and Uq (r) \u2286 Uq (b) such\nthat the following holds:\n\u223c\n\u223c\ni) Multiplication define linear isomorphisms Uq (r) \u2297 Uq (l) \u2212\u2192 Uq (p), Uq (l) \u2297 Uq (r) \u2212\u2192\n\u223c\nUq (p) and Uq (r) \u2297 Uq (l) \u2297 Uq (r) \u2212\u2192 Uq (parabolic triangular decomposition).\nii) Uq (r) and Uq (r) are integrable adr (Uq (l))-modules.\niii) Uq (r) is a left coideal in Uq (b).\niv) Uq (r) specializes to U(r) at q = 1.\nProof. The Majid-Radford theorem, [Maj93, R85], implies the following: Let \u03c0 : H \u2192 H0 be\na split projection of Hopf algebras (i.e. there exists a Hopf algebra injection \u03b9 : H0 \u2192 H such\nthat \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b9 = Id.) Put B := B(H, H0 ) = {x \u2208 H; \u03c0(x1 ) \u2297 x2 = 1 \u2297 x}. Then multiplication\n\u223c\ndefines an isomorphism H0 \u2297 B \u2212\u2192 H. Observe that B is automatically stable under the\nright adjoint action of H0 on H and that B is a left coideal in H.\nNote that if H = \u2295n\u2208N Hn is an N-graded Hopf algebra, then the projection \u03c0 : H \u2192 H0 is\nsplit.\nAssume that H and H0 are Hopf algebras over A. Then we see that the construction of\nB above commutes with every specialization t \u2192 q. Because, if we let Bq = B(Hq , H0,q ) and\nBt7\u2192q = B(H, H0 )q , we clearly have Bt7\u2192q \u2286 Bq and, since H0q \u2297 Bq = Hq = H0q \u2297 Bt7\u2192q , we\nget Bt7\u2192q = Bq .\nres\nLet UA (p)\u2032 be the subalgebra of Ures\nA (p) generated by UA (p) and UA (l). Consider on UA (p)\nres\n\u2032\n(resp. on UA (p) ) the grading for which deg Uq (l) = 0 (resp. deg UA (l) = 0) and deg E\u03b2 = 1,\nfor \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 \\ \u2206P . Let B := B(UA (p), UA (l)) and B \u2032 := B(UA (p)\u2032 , Ures\nA (l)). Since\nres\nres\nres\n\u2032\nres\nUres\nA (l) \u2297 B = UA (p) = UA (l) \u2297UA (l) UA (p) = UA (l) \u2297UA (l) (UA (l) \u2297 B) = UA (l) \u2297 B.\n\nand, evidently, B \u2286 B \u2032 we get B = B \u2032 . This implies that B is stable under the right adjoint\naction of Ures\nA (l). We shall next prove that this action is integrable:\nObserve that K\u2212\u03b2 E\u03b2 \u2208 B(UA (p), UA (l)). We have (using the Serre relations) that\nad1\u2212h\u03b1,\u03b2i\n(E\u03b1 )(K\u2212\u03b2 E\u03b2 ) = adr (F\u03b1 )(K\u2212\u03b2 E\u03b2 ) = 0, \u03b1 6= \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206.\nr\nThis implies that K\u2212\u03b2 E\u03b2 \u2208 Ul-Aint , for \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 \\ \u2206P . Then B is generated as an algebra by the\nUres\nA (p)-module generated by K\u2212\u03b2 E\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 \\ \u2206P . This follows from an induction similar to\nthe one given in the proof of Theorem 4.1 in [G11]. We have omitted the details here.\nThus we have proved that Ures\nA (l)-module structure integrates to an LA -module structure\non B. Putting Uq (r) := Bq , we get that Uq (r) is an Lq -module for which the first isomorphism of i) holds. Similarly, we construct an Lq -module Uq (r) \u2282 Uq (b) such that the second\nisomorphism of i) holds. The third isomorphism of i) follows from the first two.\nii) and iii) are already proved. By a computation we have U(r) = B(U(p), U(l)), which,\ntogether with the fact that B commutes with specializations, proves iv).\n\u0003\n\n\fERIK\n20\nBACKELIN AND KOBI KREMNIZER ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION IN ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS\n\nIt follows from the constructions that Uq (r) and Uq (r) are Hopf-algebras in the braided tensor category of modules over the Drinfel'd double of Uq (l). But they are not Hopf-subalgebras\nof Uq (b), resp. of Uq (b), in the usual sense, i.e. they are not closed under the coproduct, not\neven for r = n.\n\u223c\n\nCorollary 6.4. Multiplication define linear isomorphisms Uq (r) \u2297 Uq (l)int \u2212\u2192 Uq (p)l-int ,\n\u223c\n\u223c\nUq (l)int \u2297 Uq (r) \u2212\u2192 Uq (p)l-int and Uq (r) \u2297 Uq (l)int \u2297 Uq (r) \u2212\u2192 Ul-q int .\nProof. Let us prove the third isomorphism, the others are similar. We assume for simplicity\nthat q is generic (at a root of unity one should use A-forms in the argument below). Note that\nby i) and ii) of Proposition-Definition 6.3 we see that multiplication defines an embedding\nUq (r) \u2297 Uq (l)int \u2297 Uq (r) \u2192 Ul-q int . We must show it is surjective.\nP\nLet v \u2208 Ul-q int . We can decompose v =\nxi \u2297 yj \u2297 zk according to the isomorphism of\nProposition-Definition 6.3 ii) where we can assume that the xi 's yj 's and zk 's are linearly\nindependent weight vectors. We must show that each yj \u2208 Uq (l)int .\nAssume in order to get a contradiction that there is a j0 such that yj0 \u2208 Uq (l) \\ Uq (l)int .\nThus there is WLOG an E = E\u03b1 such that adE := adr (E) is not locally finite on yj0 ; this\nimplies that for all s \u2265 1 we have\n(\u2217)\n\nadsE (yj0 ) \u2208\n/ Span{adtE (yj0 ); t < s}.\n\nWe claim that this implies that adE is not locally finite on v. By subtracting all summands\nxi \u2297 yj \u2297 zk for which adE is locally finite on yj we can assume that adE is not locally finite\non any yj and hence we can assume that there is a vector xi0 \u2297 yj0 \u2297 zk0 such that xi0 has\nlowest weight among all the xi 's. But then adsE (v) contains a term K \u2212s xi0 \u2297 E s yj0 \u2297 zi0 ,\nwhere K = K\u03b1 , which by (\u2217) isn't cancelled by the other terms. This gives the desired\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nRemarks 6.5. A) It follows from the proof of Proposition-Definition 6.3 that the case n = r\ndef\n\ngives Uq (n) = ChK\u2212\u03b1 E\u03b1 ; \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206i. This definition is not the standard one: usually one takes\nUq (n) to be ChE\u03b1 ; \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206i. It follows however from the Serre relations that our Uq (n) is\nisomorphic to the latter algebra.\nB) Observe that Uq (r)>0 annihilates every finite dimensional irreducible representation of\nUq (p). Moreover, Uq (b) * Uq (r)>0 is generated as a left Uq (b)-ideal by E\u03b1 and E\u03b1 E\u03b2 , for\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 \\ \u2206P and \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206P .\nC) The result of Corollary 6.4 is optimal in the sense that it is impossible to construct a\n\u2032\np-parabolic triangular decomposition of Ulq -fin for l\u2032 a Levi such that l $ l\u2032 .\nReferences\n[APW91] H.
