The key characteristic of\nESCs is their large size compared to typical globular clusters even though the two cluster\npopulations are rather similar in terms of other parameters, i.e., color and luminosity. Several scenarios have been suggested to explain the formation of ESCs. However, the currently\nknown ESCs may be a mixture of populations with heterogeneous formation histories. Future observational and theoretical studies are expected to better constrain the origins of\nESCs as well as to increase their sample size.\n\n1\n\nObservational Characteristics of ESCs\n\nESCs are one of the new cluster populations being discovered with the advance of observational studies of star clusters. They are characterized by a relatively large size, that is, the\nhalf-light radii Rh ' 10 pc, compared to typical globular clusters (GC) with Rh \u223c 2 \u2013 3 pc.\nSome examples may include faint fuzzy clusters discovered in SB0 type galaxies (Brodie &\nLarsen 2002; Hwang & Lee 2006) and extended clusters found in the halo of M31 (Huxor\net al. 2005, 2011). Even in the Milky Way galaxy, there are rather extended GCs found in\nthe outer halo (van den Bergh & Mackey 2004). The ESCs in dwarf galaxies had not been\nknown until the discovery of new ESCs in an isolated dIrr galaxy NGC 6822 (Hwang et al.\n2005, 2011). Those new ESCs in NGC 6822 are the nearest sample of ESCs available to date\n(D\u2248 500 kpc).\nAnother noteworthy characteristic of ESCs is their spatial distribution. It is shown\nthat the ESCs in NGC 6822 are preferentially aligned along the old stellar halo that lies\nalmost perpendicular to the HI disk like structure (see Fig.1 in Hwang et al. 2011). Faint\nfuzzy clusters in NGC 5195 and M51 also exhibit elongated spatial distribution, which is not\nfollowed by red compact clusters (Hwang & Lee 2006, 2008). This elongated distribution\nof ESCs is different from the one reported for faint fuzzy clusters in NGC 1023 that are\nusually found in the galaxy disk (Larsen & Brodie 2000). For ESCs in M31, no distinct\n\n\f2\n\nOrigin of Extended Star Clusters\n\nspatial distribution is apparent. However, it is suggested that many ESCs in M31 appear to\nbe associated with stellar streams in the halo (Collins et al. 2009; Huxor et al. 2011).\n\n2\n\nScenarios at the moment\n\nFigure 1 shows the correlations between Rh and MV of various types of objects including GCs,\nLMC, UCDs (ultra compact dwarfs), DGTOs (dwarf globular transition objects), UFDs (ultra\nfaint dwarfs), dSph galaxies, as well as ESCs in M31, M33, and NGC 6822. There are at\nleast two important points to note. Firstly, ESCs are found in almost every type of galaxies\nranging from dwarfs (e.g., NGC 6822, Scl-dE1) to giant spirals (e.g., M31) and ellipticals\n(e.g., NGC 5128). Secondly, there are two subclasses of ESCs with different luminosity: one\nwith MV < \u22129.4 and the other with MV > \u22128.0. The bright ESCs are found to occupy the\ncommon parameter space with UCDs or DGTOs, while the faint ESCs extend toward UFDs.\nVarious scenarios for the origins of those ESCs have been proposed and some reviews\non each scenario and exemplary ESCs are given in Hwang et al. (2011). A brief summary\nis as follows: (1) Remnants or cores of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies may form ESCs. (2)\nCollisions of two or more star clusters in star cluster complexes or super-star cluster may\nmake ESCs. (3) Star clusters are born in various sizes and some ESCs may survive the\ndisruption under the weak tidal field. (4) Another scenario very recently pointed out by\nGieles et al. (2011) is that slow expansion of initially compact clusters under the tidal field\nmay have produced ESCs whose size evolution can be explained by adopting a line of constant\nrelaxation time in the mass-radius diagram.\nUsually, bright ESCs could be the remnant of disrupted dwarf galaxies or the multiple\nstar cluster collisions, while faint ESCs may have evolved under the optimal tidal field to\nsurvive or to expand to their current forms. But no observational evidence is available yet to\njustify such dichotomy and/or to prefer any scenario over the others. However, every scenario\ninvolves the tidal interactions and/or mergers on the scale of star clusters or galaxies that\nshould be the major physical drivers that make ESCs.\nFor the better understanding and clarification of the ESCs and their possible use for the\ngalaxy evolution studies, future observations with improved photometric depth and spectral\nresolution as well as wider spatial coverage are required. In view of this expectation, GAIA\nwill play a crucial role to survey even more ESCs in the Milky Way and to reveal their true\nnature and origin.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI acknowledge invaluable collaborations with Myung Gyoon Lee, Hong Soo Park, Won-Kee Park, and\nSang Chul Kim in the course of the study on ESCs in NGC 6822.
