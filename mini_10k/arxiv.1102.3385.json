The\nrelation between the relativistic equipartition relation and the rate of heat transfer\nis discussed in the relativistic case together with the nature of the noise term.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPhysical interpretation and theoretical interpretation of Brownian motion, a well-known\nprocess named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827, were first established by\nEinstein and Smoluchowski, then developed by Langevin and many others. From these\nstudies, it was made clear that Brownian motion is nothing but the manifestation of the\npresence of invisible microscopic bodies such as atoms and molecules, and their thermal\nmotion. Thus, Brownian motion has naturally been discussed in relation with kinetic theories\nand thermodynamics. Nowadays concepts and methods of stochastic processes introduced\nin the formulation of Brownian motion are widely applied to various fields of science such\nas biophysics and economy. Mathematical foundation of these methods has also been well\nstudied.\nAfter thermodynamics was established in the nineteenth century, many efforts have been\nmade to understand the thermodynamic principles from the microscopic point of view. The\nachievements of these efforts are summarized today as statistical mechanics. There, the time\naverage of microscopic behaviors is replaced by an average in terms of a suitably chosen\nstatistical ensemble of microscopic events and the temporal behavior of each particle is not\nquestioned. Therefore, the basic question to the foundation of statistical mechanics is how\nthis substitution of averages is justified from the microscopic deterministic point of view.\n\n\f2\nOf course such a question has been studied deeply in many ways since the time of Maxwell,\nBoltzmann and Gibbs such as H-theorem and ergodic theory. Mathematically rigorous or\nnot, for physicists the overwhelming success of statistical mechanics itself to describe the\nnature for thermally equilibrated systems could be considered as the proof of validity of the\nhypothesis.\nOn the other hand, recently, it is more and more becoming important to understand\nthe bulk properties of a dynamical system where the thermodynamic equilibrium is not\nnecessarily attained. For example, in the field of relativistic heavy ion collisions (RIC), we\nwould like to determine the thermodynamic properties of quark and gluon plasma (QGP)\nfrom the experimental data. RIC is somehow the unique way in laboratories to extract the\nthermodynamic properties of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the deconfined phase.\nHowever, of course, real systems in RIC situation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium,\nsince the system size and the reaction time scale are finite. Although many successful\nmodels, such as relativistic hydrodynamics have been employed to describe several aspects\nof the observed data, we feel still an existence of \"missing link\" between the thermodynamic\nproperties and microscopic dynamics. For example, several questions like, \"How much can we\nbe sure that the equation of state used to fit the experimental flow data with hydrodynamics\nshould be the same as that of obtained from the lattice QCD calculations?\", \"Is the extended\nthermodynamics valid and unique?\", or \"How to deal with the relativistic covariance and\nthermodynamic limit?\" are yet difficult to be answered. In this sense, it may still worthwhile\nto ask the repeated question for the basic foundation of statistical mechanics from the view\npoint of these new physics necessities of nowadays.\nThe stochastic energetics may serve a useful tool to understand the questions above [1].\nIn this approach, the dynamics of each event of a Brownian motion is directly reflected in\nthe change of thermodynamic quantities, such as heat, energy and work. That is, these\nthermodynamic quantities are also dealt as stochastic variables, reflecting in the name of\nthis approach, stochastic energetics. Therefore, the application of this approach seems to be\nuseful for RIC studies, where event by event fluctuations are considered to carry important\ninformation on QCD [2].\nSo far, the stochastic energetics has been applied to non-relativistic phenomena. However\nit seems very attractive to apply this approach to investigate the thermodynamic properties\nfor relativistic systems. This is because it is possible to incorporate the effect of special\n\n\f3\nrelativity (such as the Lorentz transform) into the model in a straight-forward manner, permitting to discuss directly the relation between thermodynamics and the theory of relativity.\nSuch an analysis is difficult in statistical physics where temporal averages are replaced by ensemble averages from the beginning. The purpose of this paper is to show that the stochastic\nenergetics is still applicable to Brownian motion of a relativistic particle. It is important\nto notice that this is not a trivial problem, because equations of motion for stochastic variables involves a finite time interval so that the space and time entangles when the Lorentz\ntransformation is involved. Therefore, we have to pay a special attention for the treatment\nof noise when we discuss a relativistic stochastic motion in a general reference frame.\nThe present paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we introduce a model of relativistic\nBrownian motion. Relativistic generalization of Brownian motion has been discussed by\nmany authors [3\u201315], but the definitive answer to this problem has not yet established,\nor simply does not exist in a unique manner. As mentioned above, this is because of the\ndifficulty to introduce a manifestly Lorentz covariant noise in an unambiguous way, as well as\nits physical model. Here, instead of formulating a covariant equation of motion for stochastic\nvariables in a general case, we discuss a less ambitious problem. We start from a Langevin\nequation for relativistic Brownian motion defined in the rest frame of a heat bath. Then\nwe determine how the noise term should transform under an arbitrary Lorentz boost of the\nsystem in order to keep the internal consistency. We show that in such a situation, we can\nintroduce a consistent noise term. In Sec. 3, we apply the idea of the stochastic energetics\nto our model of relativistic Brownian motion and derive the first and the second law of\nthermodynamics. We also discuss the relation between the rate of heat transfer and the\nrelativistic equipartition relation. Summary and concluding remarks are given in Sec. 4.\nIn this paper, we used the natural unit, ~ = c = kB = 1.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL OF RELATIVISTIC BROWNIAN MOTION\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the formulation of the relativistic Langevin equation\ncontains still an open question due to the transformation property of the thermal noise. To\navoid this question, we start with a well-defined model of relativistic Brownian motion in\nthe rest frame of a heat bath. Then we study the transformation of the system under a\nLorentz boost and check the consistency between our model and special relativity.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nRelativistic Brownian motion in the rest frame of heat bath\n\nWe consider the Brownian motion of a relativistic particle with mass m in the 3+1\ndimension. In the rest frame of a heat bath, we consider the following Langevin equation,\n\nwhere p0\u2217 =\n\ndx\u2217\np\u2217\n=\n,\ndt\u2217\np0\u2217\np\ndp\u2217\n0\u2217\n\u2217\n=\n\u2212\u03bd(p\n)p\n+\n2D(p0\u2217 )N(t\u2217 ),\ndt\u2217\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\np\n(p\u2217 )2 + m2 , that is, the particle always kept on the mass-shell. Throughout\n\nthis paper, we use the symbol \u2217 to indicate the value of a variable defined in the rest frame of\nthe heat bath. The parameters \u03bd(p0\u2217 ) and D(p0\u2217 ) characterize, respectively, the relaxation\nof the momentum and the strength of the noise. We assume that they are Lorentz scalar\nfunctions, depending only on the particle energy in this frame.

The similar Langevin equations have already discussed in Refs. [10\u201315].\nNote that the Langevin equation can be obtained even from a binary collision model [16].\nNow we replace the Langevin equation with the following stochastic differential equation\n(SDE),\ndx\u2217 =\n\np\u2217 \u2217\ndt ,\np0\u2217\n\ndp\u2217 = \u2212\u03bd(p0\u2217 )p\u2217 dt\u2217 +\n\n(5a)\np\n\n2D(p0\u2217 )dwt\u2217 .\n\n(5b)\n\nHere we have introduced the Wiener process wt\u2217 and its difference by\ndwt\u2217 \u2261 wt\u2217 +dt\u2217 \u2212 wt\u2217 = N(t\u2217 )dt\u2217 .\n\n(6)\n\n\f5\nThe correlations are given by\nhdwt\u2217\u2217i iRF = 0,\nhdwti\u2217\u2217k dwtj\u2217\u2217 iRF = dt\u2217 \u03b4ij \u03b4kl .\nl\n\nThe last term of Eq.

The definition of Stieltjes integral\nin stochastic variables is known to be not unique. Here we consider the three typical cases.\nNote that this problem associated with the discretization scheme is discussed in Refs. [12, 13]\nin detail.\n1. Ito interpretation [17]:\nIn this case, the term (9) is interpreted as\np\n\n2D(p0\u2217 ) \u229b dwt\u2217\u2217 =\n\np\n2D(p0\u2217 (t\u2217 ))(wt\u2217\u2217 +dt\u2217 \u2212 wt\u2217\u2217 ).\n\n(10)\n\nHereafter, we use the symbol \u229b to indicate the Ito interpretation of the integral measure.\n2. Stratonovich-Fisk interpretation [17]:\nIn this case (hereafter, we use the symbol \u25e6 ), the term (9) is interpreted as\np\np\n0\u2217 (t\u2217 + dt\u2217 )) +\np\n2D(p\n2D(p0\u2217 (t\u2217 )) \u2217\n(wt\u2217 +dt\u2217 \u2212 wt\u2217\u2217 )\n2D(p0\u2217 ) \u25e6 dwt\u2217\u2217 =\n2\np\np\np\n= D(p0\u2217 )\u2202p\u2217 D(p0\u2217 )dt\u2217 + 2D(p0\u2217 ) \u229b dwt\u2217\u2217 .\n\n(11)\n\nwhere, in the second line, we used the Ito formula (See Appendix) to convert the\nStratonovich-Fisk interpretation by the Ito scheme.\n3. H\u00e4nggi-Klimontovich [16, 18, 20]:\nIn this case (hereafter, we use the symbol \u22c6 ), the term (9) as\np\n\n2D(p0\u2217 ) \u22c6 dwt\u2217\u2217 =\n\np\n\n2D(p0\u2217 (t\u2217 + dt\u2217 ))(wt\u2217\u2217 +dt\u2217 \u2212 wt\u2217\u2217 )\np\np\np\n= 2 D(p0\u2217 )(\u2202p\u2217 D(p0\u2217 ))dt\u2217 + 2D(p0\u2217 ) \u229b dwt\u2217\u2217 .\n\n(12)\n\nHere, again, we used the Ito formula to express this interpretation in terms of Ito\nscheme. See Appendix.\n\n\f6\nThe equilibrium distribution function described by using these SDEs depends on the\nintegral schemes defined above. To see this, we introduce the probability density in the\nphase space defined in the thermal bath rest frame,\n\u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ) = h\u03b4 (3) (x \u2212 x\u2217 (t\u2217 ))\u03b4 (3) (p \u2212 p\u2217 (t\u2217 ))iRF .\n\n(13)\n\nThe time evolution of \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ) is given by the Fokker-Planck equation in a unified way\nfor the different integral schemes as\nX\nX\npi\u2217\n\u2202xi \u2217 ( 0\u2217 \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 )) +\n\u2202t\u2217 \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ) = \u2212\n\u2202pi \u2217 (\u03bd(p0\u2217 )pi\u2217 \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ))\np\ni\ni\nX\n+\n\u2202pi \u2217 (D 1\u2212\u03b1 (p0\u2217 )\u2202pi \u2217 D \u03b1 (p0\u2217 )\u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 )).\n\n(14)\n\ni\n\nThe values of the parameter \u03b1 correspond to the different discretization schemes: \u03b1 = 0 for\nthe H\u00e4nggi-Klimontovich scheme, \u03b1 = 1/2 for the Stratonovich-Fisk scheme, and \u03b1 = 1 for\nthe Ito scheme.\nFrom this equation, we find that the corresponding equilibrium distribution (spatially\nhomogeneous and static) is given by\n\u03c1eq (x\u2217 , p\u2217 ) \u221d exp\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\np0 (p\u2217 )\n\n!\n\u03bd(s)\n\u2212 \u03b1 ln D(p0 (p\u2217 )) .\ns ds\nD(s)\n\n(15)\n\nSince the phase space volume element d\u0393 = d3 x\u2217 d3 p\u2217 should be an invariant measure under the Lorentz transformation of the reference frame, we conclude that this equilibrium\ndistribution (13) should be a Lorentz scalar function, although the proof is not trivial at\nall [21, 22]. As we will see later, we can define the transformation property of the noise by\nusing this fact.\n\nB.\n\nRelativistic Brownian motion in a moving frame\n\nWe consider the reference frame which is moving with a constant velocity V with respect\nto the rest frame of the heat bath. We refer to as MF-moving frame.

The presence of a second rank\nb indicates that the noise is no longer isotropic in the moving frame [23].\ntensor B\nThe last term is not yet transformed because it contains the noise dwt\u2217\u2217 which is defined\n\nonly in the RF. We first introduce the stochastic noise which shows the property of the\nGaussian white noise in the MF as\nhdwt\u2217 iMF = 0,\n\n(20)\n\nhdwti\u2217l dwtj\u2217m iMF = dt\u2217 \u03b4ij \u03b4lm ,\n\n(21)\n\nHere the symbol hXiM F denotes the stochastic average of X in the MF. As was assumed in\nprevious works [3\u201313], we may consider that the correlations of the noise term are Lorentz\ninvariant in the rest frame of the particle, and we could write\nhdwt iMF = hdwt\u2217\u2217 iRF = 0,\n\n(22)\n\n\u03b3\u0303(p)hdwtik dwtjl iMF = \u03b3(p\u2217 )hdwti\u2217\u2217k dwtj\u2217\u2217 iRF = d\u03c4 \u03b4ij \u03b4kl ,\nl\n\n(23)\n\nwhere d\u03c4 is the proper time of the particle, \u03b3(p\u2217 ) and \u03b3\u0303(p) are the Lorentz factors of the\nparticle in the RF and in the MF, respectively. They are related through\n\u03b3\u0303(p) = (\u039b(V)\u039b(\u2212p\u2217 ))00 = \u03b3(V)\u03b3(p\u2217)(1 \u2212 \u03b2(V )\n\np\u2217V\n),\np0\u2217\n\n(24)\n\n\f8\nwhere, now \u03b3(V) is the Lorentz factor associated to the Lorentz transformation from the\nRF to the MF. In this case, we conclude that the transformation property of the noise is\ngiven by\ndwt\u2217\u2217 =\n\nr\n\ndt\u2217\ndt\n\ndwt =\n\np\n\n\u03b3(p)\u03b3\u0303 \u22121 (p\u2217 )dwt = \u03b3 1/2 (V )\n\ns\n\np0 \u2212 \u03b2(V )pV\ndwt .\np0\n\n(25)\n\nAlthough very reasonable, a proof of the above argument is not obvious. The reason\nis that the Stieltjes integral associated with the noise term is defined on the time span dt,\nso that dwt\u2217\u2217 is non-local in the time t. Thus the Lorentz transformation entangles with\nthe integration scheme in the order of dt. Then the noise term itself is not necessarily\ncovariant but can constitute a Lorentz vector only together with the force term. That is,\nthe force part and the stochastic part could be mixed. This might be understood well from\nthe argument of the kinetic derivation of hydrodynamics. In the rest frame of fluids, the\nvelocities of molecules are completely random and all the kinetic energy of molecules are\nreplaced by internal thermodynamic quantities. On the other hand, when fluids move, a\npart of velocities of molecules contributes to the collective flow of fluids. In this case, the\nfirst order correlation calculated in the MF of the noise term in the rest frame of the heat\nbath would not necessarily vanish,\nhdwt\u2217\u2217 iMF 6= 0,\n\n(26)\n\neven if hdwt\u2217\u2217 iRF = 0.\nConsidering the finiteness of dt, let us write, instead of Eq. (25), the following more\ngeneral transformation property of the noise,\nr\ndt\u2217\ndwt + Cp dt\ndwt\u2217\u2217 =\ndt s\n= \u03b3 1/2 (V )\n\np0 \u2212 \u03b2(V )pV\ndwt + Cp dt.\np0\n\n(27)\n\nHere Cp dt term entangles with the force term in the MF, which should be separated from\nthe pure stochastic part dwt , satisfying Eqs. (20) and (21).

(28) should be calculated according to the Ito scheme. Note that the\nIto formula to convert the SDE from one scheme to the other must be used only after the\ntransformation of the noise, Eq. (27).\nThe corresponding Fokker-Plank equation for the SDE (28) is\n\u0015\nX pi\nX \u0014\n1 j\ni\ni\ni\nT ij\n\u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212\n\u2202x 0 \u03c1 +\n\u2202p \u2212A + \u2202p (B\u0303B\u0303 ) \u03c1,\np\n2\ni\ni\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\n\u001b\n\u0013\u001a\n\u03b2(V )m2 n\nD \u2032 (u\u03bc p\u03bc )\n\u03bd(u\u03bc p\u03bc )\u03b3(V )(p0 \u2212 \u03b2(V )pV )\np\u2212 0\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\nA= \u2212\np0\np0\np \u2212 \u03b2(V )pV\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u03bc\nm\nD(u p\u03bc )\nb Cp .\n2+ 2\nn+B\n+ \u03b2\u03b3(V )\n0\n0\np\n\u03b3 (V )(p \u2212 \u03b2(V )pV )2\n\u0012\n\n(31)\n\nConsequently, the equilibrium distribution function is given by the solution of the following\nequation,\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 j\nT ij\n\u2212A + \u2202p (B\u0303B\u0303 ) \u03c1eq (x, p) = 0,\n2\ni\n\nleading to the equilibrium distribution \u03c1eq satisfying\n\u0012\n\u0011jk \u0013\nX\n1 k\u0010\ni\nT \u22121\nj\nT\n(\u2202p \u03c1eq )/\u03c1eq = 2\n(B\u0303B\u0303 )ij A \u2212 \u2202p B\u0303B\u0303\n.\n2\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\njkl\n\nSince \u03c1eq should be a scalar function, the above expression must coincide with the Lorentz\ntransform of the logarithmic derivative of the equilibrium distribution function obtained in\nthe RF. A lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that \u03c1eq can be the Lorentz scalar\nonly when\nCp \u2261 0.\n\n(34)\n\nThus, for the present model of a Brownian motion with the noise from a given heat bath,\nwe conclude that the noise term transforms separately from the force term when we go to\none reference frame to the other. That is, the transformation of the noise (25) is consistent\nwith the special relativity, and the corresponding SDE in a MF should be given by Eq. (18).\nWhen the background does not satisfy this condition, it is not obvious if we can always\nassume Cp \u2261 0 from the beginning. Our discussion here is only for the thermal background\nis homogeneous and static.\n\n\f10\nC.\n\nGeneralized fluctuation-dissipation relation\n\nSo far, we have not specified the parameter of the SDE, but when we demand that the\nequilibrium distribution function should be given by the J\u00fcttner distribution in a MF,\n\u03c1eq = Const. \u00d7 e\u2212u\n\n\u03bcp\n\n\u03bc /T\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere T denotes temperature. From this condition, the parameters of the SDE satisfy the\nfollowing relation,\n1\n\u03bd(u p\u03bc ) = \u03bc\nu p\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nD(u\u03bc p\u03bc )\n\u2032 \u03bc\n\u2212 \u03b1D (u p\u03bc ) ,\nT\n\n(36)\n\nwhich is the generalized Einstein's fluctuation-dissipation relation of relativistic Brownian\nmotion. Note that this relation depends on \u03b1, showing the discretization scheme dependence\nwhen D is not a constant.\n\nIII.\n\nRELATIVISTIC STOCHASTIC ENERGETICS\n\nOnce we have established the SDE for a relativistic particle embedded in a heat bath,\nwe can discuss the thermodynamic property of the system defined as the ensemble of these\nrelativistic Brownian particles. For this purpose, from now on, we discuss only in the rest\nframe of the heat bath,\ndx\u2217 =\n\np\u2217 \u2217\ndt ,\np0\u2217\n\ndp\u2217 = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 dt\u2217 \u2212 \u03bd(p0\u2217 )p\u2217 dt\u2217 +\n\n(37a)\np\n\n2D(p0\u2217 ) \u229b dwt\u2217 ,\n\n(37b)\n\nwhere we have not assumed the generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation. For the sake of\nthe discussion of the first law of thermodynamics, we introduced a scalar potential \u03c6(x\u2217 , t\u2217 )\nwhere the explicit time dependence of \u03c6 represents the effect of some external forces.\n\nA.\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics\n\nFollowing Ref. [1], let us introduce heat as a stochastic variable associated with Brownian motion. Among the three contributions of the forces in Eq.(37b), the last two terms\nrepresent the interactions between a system and the heat bath. The first term represents\n\n\f11\nthe mechanical force through the scalar potential \u03c6. Thus the work done by the heat bath,\nthat is, the heat transfer, d\u2032 Q to a Brownian particle is defined as[30]\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\ndwt\u2217\n\u2032\n0\u2217\n\u2217\n0\u2217\n\u25e6 dx\u2217 .\nd Q = \u2212\u03bd(p )p + 2D(p ) *\ndt\u2217\n\nUsing Eq.(37b) we can rewrite Eq.(38) as\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2217\ndp\n\u2032\n+ \u2207\u03c6 \u25e6 dx\u2217\ndQ=\n\u2217\ndt\n\u0001 \u2202\u03c6\n= d p0\u2217 + \u03c6 \u2212 \u2217 dt\u2217 .\n\u2202t\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\nHere, we identify the first term represents the change of the total energy of a Brownian\nparticle dE including its potential energy. The quantity (\u2202\u03c6/\u2202t\u2217 ) dt\u2217 in the last term is the\nchange of the energy contained in the scalar potential \u03c6 due to the change in some external\nparameters contained in \u03c6. That is, it can be interpreted as the mechanical work d\u2032 W done\nby the external forces to the system. Thus, rewriting Eq.(39) as\nd\u2032 Q = dE \u2212 d\u2032 W,\n\n(40)\n\nwe can view this as the first law of thermodynamics in the framework of the stochastic\nenergetics, the generalization of Ref. [1] for relativistic Brownian motion. Note that this\nrelation is satisfied for each event of Brownian motion [31].\n\nB.\n\nThe Second Law\n\nIn the above, we introduced the potential \u03c6 to identify clearly the role of external work\nin the first law of thermodynamics, and, there, the choice of the parameters of the SDE\nwas arbitrary. In the following discussion of other thermodynamic relations, however, we\nwill consider only the case where \u03c6 = 0 and impose the generalized fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem to the SDE.\nFor deriving the second law of thermodynamics in the stochastic energetics, we introduce\nShannon's information entropy,\nS=\u2212\n\nZ\n\nd\u0393 \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ) ln \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ),\n\n(41)\n\nwhere \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ) is defined in Eq.(13) and satisfies the Fokker-Plank equation (14). The\nintegration in Eq.(41) is taken over all the phase space volume. From these definitions for\n\n\f12\nheat (38) and entropy (41), it is easy to show that the time derivatives of heat and entropy\nare related as\n1\ndS\nT \u2217\u2212\ndt\nT\n\n\u001c\n\nd\u2032 Q\ndt\u2217\n\n\u001d\n\n=\nRF\n\nZ\n\nT D(p0\u2217 )\nd\u0393\n\u03c1\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1 p\u2217\n\u2207p \u03c1 +\n\u03c1 ,\nT p0\u2217\n\n(42)\n\nSince the right-hand side of the above equation is non-negative, we obtain the following\ninequality,\ndS\n1\n\u2212\n\u2217\ndt\nT\n\n\u001c\n\nd\u2032 Q\ndt\u2217\n\n\u001d\n\nRF\n\n\u2265 0,\n\n(43)\n\nwhich is nothing but the second law of thermodynamics. For the non-relativistic case, see\nRef. [1, 24]. An important fact is that, differently from the first law, the second law is\nsatisfied only for the average heat, and can be violated for each event, as is the case of the\nfluctuation theorem.\n\nC.\n\nRelativistic Equipartition Theorem\n\nIn the preceding section, we have shown that the first and the second laws of thermodynamics can be consistently derived by generalizing the stochastic energetics to relativistic\nBrownian motion. Let us apply this approach to discuss another example, the equipartion\ntheorem.\nIn non-relativistic systems, the equipartion theorem tells us that the average kinetic\nenergy of a particle of an ideal gas in equilibrium is equally distributed by T /2 for each\ndegree of freedom. For 3-dimensional mono-atomic gas, we have\n\u001c 2\u001d\n3\np\n= T,\n2m t\u2192\u221e 2\n\n(44)\n\nwhere hOit denotes the expectation value of O at the instant t, which can be expressed as\nZ\nhOit = d\u0393 \u03c1 (x, p,t) O (x, p) ,\n(45)\nwith \u03c1(x, p, t) is the solution of the Fokker-Plank equation corresponding to the following\nnon-relativistic SDE,\np\ndt,\nm\n\u221a\np\ndp = \u2212\u03bd dt \u2212 \u2207x U(x)dt + 2D \u229b dwt ,\nm\ndx =\n\n(46a)\n(46b)\n\n\f13\nwhere U(x) is a potential and \u03bd = D/T . Note that, the above average (45) using the solution\nof the Fokker-Planck equation is equivalent to the event average for the corresponding noise.\nIn the stochastic energetics, this relation for equipartition of energy is seen to be valid\nin more general situation if the average heat transfer vanishes even if the system is not in\nequilibrium [1]. To see this, we consider the case where D is a constant so that the noise is\nadditive. Then, the time derivative of the heat described by this SDE is given by\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u001c \u2032 \u001d\nZ\n2D\np\n3\ndQ\n=\u2212\nd\u0393\n\u2212 T \u03c1(x, p, t)\ndt\nmT\n2m 2\n\u0012\u001c 2 \u001d\n\u0013\n3\np\n2D\n\u2212 T ,\n=\u2212\nmT\n2m t 2\n\n(47)\n\nwhere the left hand side average is the event average. One can see that the equipartition\nrelation is satisfied, when the heat transfer disappears even \u03c1 is not the equilibrium distribution. Thus we may consider the condition of the null heat transfer leads to the equipartition\nrelation in more generalized situation. We will apply this idea to relativistic Brownian\nmotion.\nThe relativistic analogue is not trivial in the sense that there is no simple interpretation\nof the quantity involved [25]. The expectation value of relativistic kinetic energy, K =\np\np2 + m2 \u2212 m does not satisfy a simple relation such as Eq. (44). Tolman proposed to read\n\nEq. (44) as [26, 27]\n\n1\n2\n\nor equivalently,\n\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202E\n3\np\n= T,\n\u2202p eq 2\n\n(48)\n\n\u001c\n\n(49)\n\np2\n2p0\n\n\u001d\n\neq\n\n3\n= T,\n2\n\nwhere the subscript eq denotes the expectation value at equilibrium, that is, t \u2192 \u221e. The\nleft-hand side of Eq. (48) is proportional to the average of p * v, which is interpreted to be\nthe momentum transfer rate than the kinetic energy itself.\nAs an application of the stochastic energetics for relativistic Brownian motion, we can\nderive the relativistic analogue of Eq. (47). Taking the noise average of Eq. (38), we obtain\n\u001c \u2032 \u001d\n\u001c \u2217\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u001d\ndQ\ndx\u2217\ndp\n\u2217\n\u2217\n=\n= dp \u25e6 \u2217\n\u25e6 dx\ndt\u2217 RF\ndt\u2217\ndt RF\nRF\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n\u2217 2\n0\u2217\nD(p0\u2217 )p\u2217\nD(p ) (p )\n\u2212 \u2207p *\n\u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 )\n= \u2212 d\u0393\nT (p0\u2217 )2\np0\u2217\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2217 2\n1\nD(p0\u2217 )p\u2217\n0\u2217 (p )\nD(p ) 0\u2217 2\n=\u2212\n+ \u2207p *\n.\n(50)\nT\n(p ) t\u2217\np0\u2217\nt\u2217\n\n\f14\nTo derive this expression, we have used the relation,\n\u0012 \u2217\n\u0013\np\n1 p\u2217\np\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u25e6 dp = dp \u229b\n+ d\n.\np0\u2217\np0\u2217 2 p0\u2217\nFrom Eq.

In the\nultra-relativistic limit, this relation is reduced to\nhEit\u2217 = 3T,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere E = p0\u2217 so that it is related to the specific heat of the system.\nThe meaning of the equipartition theorem is modified for more general cases. For example,\nq\n\nsuppose the noise has the energy dependence as D \u221d (p0\u2217 ) with q = const, then Eq.(52)\nbecomes\nhE q it\u2217 = T \u00d7 (q + 2) E q\u22121\n\nt\u2217\n\n,\n\n(55)\n\nin the ultra-relativistic limit, and\n|p|q+2\n\nt\u2217\n\n= T m \u00d7 (q + 3) h|p|q it\u2217 ,\n\n(56)\n\nin the non-relativistic Brownian motion (for non-relativistic case, Eq. (50) is still the general\nform of Eq. (47) when the noise is multiplicative, provided that p0\u2217 and D(p0\u2217 ) are m and\nD(p2 ), respectively). These expressions show that the ratio of two moments of kinetic energy\nshould be kept constant proportional to the temperature. In this sense we call Eq. (52) as\nthe generalized equipartition theorem.\nFor q = \u22122 in Eq. (55) or q = \u22123 in Eq. (56), the left hand side is finte, but the\npre-factor in the right hand side vanishes. This means that the average value in the right\n\n\f15\nhand side in each equation diverges but the products\nlim (q + 2) E q\u22121\n\nq\u2192\u22122\n\nt\u2217\n\n,\n\nlim (q + 3) h|p|q it\u2217 ,\n\nq\u2192\u22123\n\n(57)\n(58)\n\nhave finite positive values and the equalities are still valid. This is easily checked for equilibrium cases, since we can calculate explicitly\n4\u03c0 q+3\nT \u0393(q + 3),\nZ\n2\u03c0\n(2mT )(q+5)/2 \u0393((q + 5)/2),\n=\nZ\n\nhE q ieq =\nh|p|q+2 ieq\n\n(59)\n(60)\n\nwhere Z is the normalization factor of the equilibrium distribution function and \u0393(x) is the\nGamma function. From the recursion relation of the Gamma function, we obtain Eqs. (55)\nand (56). Of course these relations do not make sense for q < \u22122 in Eq.(55) or for q < \u22123\nin Eq.(56), since the left had side (so the right hand side, too) diverges.\nNote that the condition, Eq.(55) or Eq.(56), itself does not determine the distribution\nfunction. Of course, if we assume that there exists a distribution function, f (E; t\u2217 ), independent of q, satisfying Eq.(55) for any q > 2, we can demonstrate that such a distribution\nfunction should be proportional to exp(\u2212E/T ), and similary for non-relativistic case. However, for a finite t\u2217 , the distribution function still reflects the initial condition and depends\non q.\nThus, as stated before, the null heat transfer condition does not mean that the system is\nin equilibrium, but inversely, the null heat transfer condition is naturally satisfied in thermal\nequilibrium for any choice of D(p0\u2217 ). For more general noise coefficient, this can be seen\ndirectly from Eq. (50) by re-expressing it as\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001c \u2032 \u001d\nZ\nD(p0\u2217 ) (p\u2217 )2\nD(p0\u2217 )p\u2217\ndQ\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u2217\n= \u2212 d\u0393\n+\n* (\u2207p ln \u03c1(x , p , t )) \u03c1(x\u2217 , p\u2217 , t\u2217 ).\ndt\u2217 RF\nT (p0\u2217 )2\np0\u2217\n(61)\nThe integrand vanishes if \u03c1 is given by the J\u00fcttner distribution function. Therefore, in\nthermal equilibrium, both of the generalized equipartition theorem (52) and the Tolman\nrelation (49) are satisfied at the same time.\nTo see how the null heat transfer condition is attained, we consider the case of a pion\nm = 139 MeV in a heat bath of T = 150 MeV as an example for a possible application to\n\n\f16\n\nFIG. 1: The two ratios as a function\nof time\n\nt\u2217\n\nFIG. 2: The two ratios as a function\n\nwith the initial condition\n\nof time t\u2217 with the initial condition\n\nof 50 MeV.\n\nof 300 MeV.\n\nRIC physics. In Figs. 1 and 2, we plot the ratio,\nE\nD\n\u2217 2\n0\u2217 (p )\nD(p\n)\n0\u2217\n2\n(p )\n1\n\u2217\nEt ,\nRGE (t\u2217 ) = D\n0\u2217\n\u2217\nT \u2207 * D(p )p\np\np0\u2217\n\n(62)\n\nt\u2217\n\nby solving Eq. (37b) for one dimensional case with \u03c6 = 0. In this example, we compare\nthe two different situations; one is that the pion is initially has a lower energy than the\ntemperature of the heat bath, p(t\u2217 = 0) = 50 MeV (Fig. 1), and the other the pion has\ninitially a higher energy, p(t\u2217 = 0) = 300 MeV (Fig. 2). When the null heat transfer\nhd\u2032 Q/dt\u2217 iRF = 0 is attained, we should have RGE (t\u2217 ) = 1. For the sake of comparison, we\nshow also the ratio\n1\nRTol (t ) =\nT\n\u2217\n\n\u001c\n\np2\np0\n\n\u001d\n\n,\n\n(63)\n\nt\u2217\n\nwhich corresponds to the Tolman relation for one dimensional case. In thermal equilibrium,\nthis value should stay at RTol (t\u2217 ) = 1. In these simulations, we consider the case of q = \u22121,\n\nthat is, D(p0\u2217 ) = K/p0\u2217 with K = 0.1 (MeV)4 . As seen from these figures, the null heat\n\ntransfer condition is almost satisfied before t\u2217 \u2243 0.5 f m/c, whereas the Tolman relation only\nconverges for t\u2217 > 1 f m/c. We checked some different parameter sets and found that such\na behavior always appears.\n\n\f17\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper, we extended the stochastic energetics for relativistic Brownian motion.\nAs a model for the relativistic particle embedded in a heat bath, we first established a\nrelativistic SDE which produces the invariant J\u00fcttner equilibrium distribution under an\narbitrary Lorentz transformation. Using this model, we discussed the thermodynamic laws\nand the equipartition theorem, by applying the stochastic energetics. We showed how the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics are derived from relativistic Brownian motion in\nthis context. We obtained the explicit form of the heat transfer rate between the relativistic\nBrownian particle and the heat bath. Of course, our results recovers the corresponding\nresults of Ref.[1] in the non-relativistic limit. As a result, we showed that the concept of the\nstochastic energetics is applicable to relativistic Brownian motion.\nWe further showed that the condition of the null heat transfer leads to the generalized\nequipartition theorem. Except for the particular choice of the parameters of the SDE, the\ngeneralized equipartition theorem does not coincide with Tolman's relativistic equipartition\ntheorem if not in thermal equilibrium. The null heat transfer and thermal equilibrium are\nnot equivalent, but the former includes the latter. As a matter of fact, we found that\nthe generalized equipartion relation is attained before the system reaches the true thermal\nequilibrium in a few examples. It will be interesting to investigate more in detail the meaning\nof null heat transfer condition with respect to possible transient thermodynamic properties.\nThe stochastic energetics is considered as a promising approach for the study of thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems [1, 28]. Thus, the present study will be a starting point of\nthe application of the stochastic energetics for the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions.\nThere, the finite size of the system, as well as the short reaction time are not negligible so\nthat the deviation from the local thermal equilibrium must be clarified. In particular, the\napproach via the stochastic energetics allows introducing the energy conservation between\nmicroscopic and macroscopic degrees of freedom. This may serve for a consistent description of the formation of initial condition or the freezeout processes of final states in the\nhydrodynamic modeling [29].\n\nThe authors acknowledge stimulating discussions with G.
