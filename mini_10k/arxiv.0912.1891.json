The \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Equations\n\n1.1. The Ordinary Seiberg-Witten Equations\nLet us consider the topological Seiberg-Witten (SW) gauge theory, which is a twisted\nN = 2, U(1) theory on a four-manifold X coupled to a twisted massless hypermultiplet\n\nwhose lowest component corresponds to a magnetically charged monopole field [1]. The\nsupersymmetric configurations of the twisted theory are obtained by setting the supersymmetric variations of the fermi fields to zero, and they correspond to the celebrated SeibergWitten equations. In order to describe these equations, let us first elaborate on the structure\nof X and its various associated bundles that are relevant to their description.\nLet X be an oriented, closed four-manifold on which we pick a Riemannian structure\n\nwith metric tensor \u1e21. \u039bp T \u2217 X, or rather \u039bp , will denote the bundle of real-valued p-forms,\nand \u039b2,\u00b1 will be the sub-bundle of \u039b2 consisting of self-dual or anti-self-dual forms. If we\nchoose w2 (X) = 0, then X is a spin manifold and one can pick positive and negative spin\nbundles S + and S \u2212 , of rank two. Next, let us introduce a U(1)-bundle L; the data in the\nSeiberg-Witten (SW) equations will then be a connection A on L and a monopole field M\n2\n\n\fthat is a section of S + \u2297 L. The curvature two-form of A will be called F ; its self-dual and\nanti-self-dual projections will be called F+ and F\u2212 . Since L exists as an ordinary line bundle\nfor X spin, c1 (L) \u2208 H 2 (X, Z).\n\nIf w2 (X) 6= 0, that is, if X is not spin, then S \u00b1 do not exist. Nevertheless, a Spinc -\n\nstructure exists on any oriented X [2], and it can be described as a choice of a rank-two\ncomplex vector bundle S + \u2297 L. In this situation, L does not exist as a line bundle, but L\u22972\n\ndoes. (A physical, path integral demonstration of these statements can be found in [3], while\na similar demonstration for the case with surface operators can be found in [4].) The data of\nthe SW equations are now a monopole field M that is a section of S + \u2297 L, and a connection\n\non S + \u2297 L with the trace of its curvature form being 2F . Thus, we see that because the\n\nmonopole field M is coupled to the gauge field A \u2013 that is, it is a section of S + \u2297 L instead\nof S + \u2013 it is still well-defined on a non-spin manifold.\nAt any rate, the SW equations are given by [5]\ni\nFij+ = \u2212 M\u0393ij M\n2\nX\ni\n\u0393 Di M = 0,\n\n(1.1)\n\ni\n\nwhere the \u0393i 's are Clifford matrices (with anticommutators {\u0393i , \u0393j } = 2\u1e21ij ), such that \u0393ij =\nP\n1\n[\u0393 , \u0393j ]. In the second equation, i \u0393i Di is the Dirac operator D that maps sections of\n2 i\nS + \u2297 L to sections of S \u2212 \u2297 L. Since S + is pseudo-real, it will mean that if M is a section\n\nof S + \u2297 L, then the complex conjugate M is a section of S + \u2297 L\u22121 . Consequently, since the\nproduct M \u2297 M lies in (S + \u2297 L) \u2297 (S + \u2297 L\u22121 ) \u223c\n= \u039b0 \u2295 \u039b2,+ , and since F+ also takes values in\n\n\u039b2,+ , we find that the first equation indeed makes sense. In terms of positive and negative\nWeyl-spinor indices \u0226, A = 1 . . . 2, the SW equations can also be expressed as\n\u0001\ni\nF\u0226\u1e02 =\nM\u0226 M \u1e02 + M\u1e02 M \u0226\n2\n\u0226\nDA\u0226 M = 0.\n\n(1.2)\n\n1.2. Supersymmetric Surface Operators\nLet us now include a supersymmetric surface operator in the theory, which is defined\nby a field configuration that is a solution to the Seiberg-Witten equations with a singularity\nalong a two-cycle D in X. Such a configuration can be represented by a U(1) gauge field\nwhich takes the form\nA = \u03b1d\u03b8 + . . .\n3\n\n(1.3)\n\n\fnear D, where the ellipses refer to the original terms that are regular near D, \u03b1 takes values\nin the (real) Lie algebra u(1) such that e2\u03c0\u03b1 \u2208 U(1), and \u03b8 is the angular variable of the\ncoordinate z = rei\u03b8 of the plane normal to D. The resulting field strength is\nF = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D + . . . ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u03b4D is a delta two-form that is Poincar\u00e9 dual to D. As required, the field strength is\nsingular as one approaches D. Moreover, the holonomy in the gauge field is exp(\u22122\u03c0\u03b1) as\none traverses a loop linking D. This nontrivial holonomy physically characterizes the surface\noperator. Notice that the holonomy is trivial for integer values of \u03b1; therefore, \u03b1 effectively\ntakes values in R/Z = S 1 \u223c\n= U(1). This restriction on \u03b1 is just the abelian version of the fact\nthat for a non-abelian gauge group G, \u03b1 ought to take values in the maximal torus T \u2282 G\nrather than its Lie algebra t [6]. (Note that T = t/\u039bcochar , where \u039bcochar is the cocharacter\nlattice of G. In our case, R and Z play the roles of t and \u039bcochar , respectively.)\nThe usual physical prescription employed in interpreting operators which introduce a\nsingularity in the gauge field along a two-cycle D in X, is to consider in the path integral,\nconnections on the U(1)-bundle L (which is singular along D \u2282 X) restricted to X\\D. In\n\nother words, one ought to sum over smooth connections in the path integral if the underlying\n\nphysical theory is to be finite and therefore well-defined.1 This is physically equivalent (see\nderivation of eqn. (2.36) in [6]) to considering connections on a U(1)-bundle L\u2032 which has\n(smooth) curvature F \u2032 = F \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D that extends over all of X, where F is the (singular\n\nalong D) curvature of L.2 In short, in order to introduce a surface operator, one just\nneeds to replace the expression of the field strength that appears in the original Lagrangian\n(without the surface operator) with F \u2032 = F \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D , and consider integrating F \u2032 over all\nof X in evaluating the action. Since the positive-definite kinetic terms of the gauge field\n1\n\nNotice that the above-described surface operator is just a two-dimensional analog of an 't Hooft loop\noperator, and in the case that one inserts an 't Hooft loop operator in X \u2013 which introduces a singularity\nin the gauge field along a loop \u03b3 \u2282 X \u2013 one can show that in order to have a well-defined theory, we must\nsum over all connections of the U (1)-bundle (that has a singularity along \u03b3) over X\\\u03b3 in the path-integral\n(see \u00a710.3 of [7]). One does likewise here.\n2\nTo further justify the arguments in [6], note that the instanton number k\u0303 of the bundle L over X\\D\nis (in the mathematical convention) given by k\u0303 = k R+ \u03b1l \u2212 (\u03b12 /2)D \u2229 D, where k is the instanton number\nof the bundle L over X with curvature F , and l = D F/2\u03c0 is the monopole number (cf . eqn. (1.7) of [8]\nfor a U (1)-bundle). On the other hand, the instanton number k \u2032 of the\nL\u2032 over X with curvature\nR bundle\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nF = F \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D is (in the physical convention) given by k = \u2212 8\u03c02 X F \u2227 F = k + \u03b1l \u2212 (\u03b12 /2)D \u2229 D.\nHence, we find that the expressions for k\u0303 and k \u2032 coincide, reinforcing the notion that the bundle L restricted\nto X\\D can be equivalently interpreted as the bundle L\u2032 defined over all of X. Of course, for F \u2032 to qualify\nas a nontrivial field strength, D must be a homology cycle of X, so that \u03b4D (like F ) is in an appropriate\ncohomology class of X.\n\n4\n\n\fin the equivalent action are non-singular, the contributions to the path integral will be\nnon-vanishing, as required of a well-defined theory.\n1.3. The \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Equations\nThe supersymmetric variations of the fields in the presence of a surface operator are\nthe same as those in the ordinary theory without, except that the expression of the (nonsingular) field strength is now given by F \u2032 . As such, the supersymmetric configurations of\nthe theory obtained by setting the variations of the fermi fields to zero can be written as\n(1.1), albeit in terms of F \u2032 ; in other words, the \"ramified\" SW equations will be given by\ni\n(F \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D )+\nij = \u2212 M \u0393ij M\n2\nX\ni\n\u0393 Di M = 0.\n\n(1.5)\n\ni\n\nThe above equations are consistent with the fact that the monopole field M is effectively\ncharged under a U(1) gauge field A\u2032 with field strength F \u2032 ; that is, M is interpreted as a\nsection of S + \u2297 L\u2032 .\n\nIn terms of positive and negative Weyl-spinor indices \u0226, A = 1 . . . 2, the \"ramified\" SW\n\nequations can also be expressed as\n\u0001\ni\nM\u0226 M \u1e02 + M\u1e02 M \u0226\n2\n= 0.\n\n(F \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D )\u0226\u1e02 =\nDA\u0226 M \u0226\n\n(1.6)\n\nLast but not least, one can indeed see that since (1.1) holds in the original theory\nwithout surface operators, then (1.3) which defines the surface operator, must be a solution\nto (1.5). In other words, (1.3) defines a supersymmetric surface operator that is compatible\nwith the underlying N = 2 supersymmetry of the SW theory.\n2.\n\nThe \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Invariants\n\n2.1. Moduli Space and the \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Invariants\n\u2032\n\nLet us now describe the moduli space Mxsw of solutions to the \"ramified\" SW equations\n\nmodulo gauge transformations, starting with the dimension.\n\nIn order to compute the (virtual) dimension of the moduli space, first consider (as in [5])\nthe following elliptic complex obtained via a linearization of the \"ramified\" SW equations\n5\n\n\f(1.5)\ns 1 \u2295 (S + \u2297 L\u2032 )\u2212\u2192\u039b\nt 2,+ \u2295 (S \u2212 \u2297 L\u2032 ) \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 \u039b0 \u2212\u2192\u039b\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere t is the linearization of the \"ramified\" SW equations, and s is the map from zero forms\nto deformations in A\u2032 (the connection on L\u2032 ) and M induced by the infinitesimal action of\nthe U(1) gauge group. Next, define the operator T = s\u2217 \u2295 t (where s\u2217 is the adjoint of s),\nwhich can be described as the map\n\nT : \u039b1 \u2295 (S + \u2297 L\u2032 ) \u2192 \u039b0 \u2295 \u039b2,+ \u2295 (S \u2212 \u2297 L\u2032 ).\n\n(2.2)\n\nThen, the (virtual) dimension of the moduli space is given by the index of T . By dropping\nterms in T of order zero, T can be deformed to the direct sum of the operator d + d\u2217\n(projected onto self-dual two-forms) from \u039b1 to \u039b0 \u2295 \u039b2,+ and the (twisted) Dirac operator\n\nD\n/ from S + \u2297 L\u2032 to S \u2212 \u2297 L\u2032 , where d\u2217 : \u039b1 \u2192 \u039b0 is the adjoint of d. The index of T is the\n\nindex of d+d\u2217 plus twice the index of the D\n/ . The d+d\u2217 operator is independent of A\u2032 and M\n\nbecause the group is abelian, and its index is given by \u2212(\u03c7 + \u03c3)/2. On the other hand, the\n\noperator D\n/ depends on L\u2032 and hence A\u2032 ; the expression for twice its index is \u2212\u03c3/4 + c1 (L\u2032 )2 .\n\u2032\n\nConsequently, the index of T , which gives the (virtual) dimension of Mxsw , is\n\u2032\n\ndxsw = \u2212\n\n2\u03c7 + 3\u03c3\n+ c1 (L\u2032 )2 .\n4\n\n(2.3)\n\u2032\n\nFor there to be solutions to the \"ramified\" SW equations, we must have dxsw \u2265 0.\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nMoreover, since dxsw is the dimension of Mxsw , it must always be an integer. In the special\n\u2032\n\ncase that dxsw = 0, that is, when x\u2032 = \u2212c1 (L\u20322 ) = \u22122c1 (L\u2032 ) obeys\nx\u20322 = 2\u03c7 + 3\u03c3,\n\n(2.4)\n\nthe moduli space generically consists of a finite set of points Pi,x\u2032 , i = 1 . . . tx\u2032 . With each\nsuch point, one can associate a number \u01ebi,x\u2032 given by the sign of the determinant of T . The\n\"ramified\" SW invariant corresponding to such a particular choice of x\u2032 is then\nSW (x\u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\n\u01ebi,x\u2032 .\n\n(2.5)\n\ni\n\nAs in the ordinary case, let us call such an x\u2032 a basic class. We will show later that there\nare only a finite number of basic classes which correspond to SW (x\u2032 ) 6= 0, and that SW (x\u2032 )\n\nis a topological invariant if b+\n2 (X) \u2265 2.\n\n6\n\n\f\u2032\n\nNote that dxsw = 0 if and only if the index of the Dirac operator is\n\u2206=\n\n\u03c7+\u03c3\n.\n4\n\n(2.6)\n\nSince \u2206 must be an integer, it implies that only manifolds with integral values of (\u03c7 + \u03c3)/4\nhave nontrivial SW (x\u2032 ). Also, note that we have\n\u2212 \u03b1l +\nwhere k = \u2212 8\u03c01 2\n\nR\n\nR\n\nF \u2227F and l =\nX\n\nD\n\nof \u2206 also implies that\n\n\u03b12\n\u03c3\nD \u2229 D = + \u2206 + k,\n2\n8\n\n(2.7)\n\nF/2\u03c0 are integers. Therefore, we find that the integrality\n\n\u03b12\n\u03c3\nD \u2229 D = mod 1.\n(2.8)\n2\n8\nIn other words, surface operators that lead to nontrivial SW (x\u2032 ) will have parameters \u03b1, l\n\u2212 \u03b1l +\n\nand self-intersection numbers D \u2229 D that obey (2.7) and hence, (2.8).\n\nNotice that if we replace L by L\u2032 \u22121 (and therefore A\u2032 by \u2212A\u2032 ), and M by M , the\n\n\"ramified\" SW equations are invariant. Nevertheless, the sign of the determinant of T will\nbe multiplied by (\u22121)\u2206 (cf . [5]). Hence, we find that\nSW (\u2212x\u2032 ) = (\u22121)\u2206 SW (x\u2032 ).\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u2032\n\nIn the general case where dxsw > 0, x\u2032 will no longer be given by (2.4), and the \"ramified\"\nSW invariants will be given by (cf . [9])\nSWx\u2032 (\u03b2i1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03b2ir ) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u2032\nMx\nsw\n\n\u03bdi1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03bdir \u2227 ad2\n\n\u2032\n\n(dx\nsw \u2212r)\n\n,\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere dxsw \u2212 r must be even and positive, ad is the vacuum expectation value of the complex\nscalar \u03c6d in the N = 2 \"magnetic\" U(1) vector multiplet, and\n\u03bdi \u223c\n\nZ\n\n\u03c8d ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u03b4i\n\nwhere \u03c8d is a (spacetime) one-form fermi field that is also in the N = 2 \"magnetic\" U(1)\n\nvector multiplet. Also, \u03b41 , . . . , \u03b4r \u2208 H1 (X, Z) with duals \u03b21 . . . \u03b2r \u2208 H 1 (X, Z). Alternatively,\n\u2032\n\nthe cokernel of T will, in this case, be a vector bundle V over Mxsw , and its Euler class\n\u2032\n\nintegrated over Mxsw will give us SWx\u2032 (\u03b2i1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03b2ir ).\n7\n\n\f\u2032\n\nIn the case of dxsw = 0 (where the invariants can only be defined as (2.5)), there will\npotentially be a difference between the ordinary and \"ramified\" SW invariants if the sign\nof the determinant of T involves F \u2032 ; it is only through F \u2032 that the invariants can inherit a\ndependence on \u03b1 and l, which, then, distinguishes them from the ordinary invariants. On\n\u2032\n\nthe other hand, for dxsw > 0, the expression of the invariants in (2.10) already manifestly\n\u2032\n\ndepends on \u03b1 and l through dxsw , since\n\u2032\ndxsw\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n= \u03b1 D \u2229 D \u2212 2\u03b1l \u2212 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n2\u03c7 + 3\u03c3\n+k .\n8\n\n(2.12)\n\nOrientation of the Moduli Space\nIn order for the above discussion to be technically consistent, one still needs to pick\n\u2032\n\nan orientation on Mxsw . Equivalently, one needs to pick an orientation of the cohomology\ngroups H0 = H 0 (X, R), H1 = KerD\n/ \u2295 H 1 (X, R) and H2 = CokerD\n/ \u2295 H 2,+ (X, R) of the\n(deformed) elliptic complex [10].\n\nThe line H 0 (X, R) has a canonical orientation, given by the class of the constant function\nx 7\u2192 1, where x is a point in X. That leaves us with the orientations of H1 and H2 . Since D\n/ is\nan elliptic, C-linear operator, both KerD\n/ and CokerD\n/ are finite-dimensional complex vector\n\nspaces; thus, they have natural orientations of their own. It is therefore clear that in order to\n\u2032\n\npick an orientation on Mxsw , one just needs to pick an orientation of H 1 (X, R) \u2295 H 2,+ (X, R),\n\nas in the ordinary case.\n\n2.2. Wall-Crossing Phenomenon\nGenerically, SW (x\u2032 ), which 'counts' the number of solutions to the \"ramified\" SW\nequations (weighted by a sign), is a topological invariant. Nevertheless, under certain special\nconditions, it can jump as one crosses a \"wall\" while moving in the space of metrics on X.\nThis subsection is devoted to explaining this in detail.\nA Relevant Digression\nBefore we proceed further, let us discuss something that was implicit in our discussions\nhitherto: that L\u2032 exists as a (complex) line bundle over X which is spin, so c1 (L\u2032 ) \u2208 H 2 (X, Z).\nR\nIn other words, U (F \u2032 /2\u03c0) \u2208 Z for any integral homology 2-cycle U \u2282 X (assuming, for\n\nsimplicity, that the homology of X is torsion-free), and therefore, \u03b1(U \u2229 D) \u2208 Z in any\n\nphysically sensible solution. Note that this condition is consistent with the fact [6] that\none can invoke a twisted U(1)-gauge transformation in the physical theory \u2013 that leaves\n8\n\n\fthe holonomy exp(\u22122\u03c0\u03b1) and thus the effective \"ramification\", invariant \u2013 which shifts\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + u for some non-integer u, such that non-trivial values of \u03b1 can, in this context, be\nregarded as integers; in particular, this also means that \u03b1(D \u2229 D) \u2208 Z \u2013 a condition which\nunderlies the integrality of the monopole number l.\n\nWall-Crossing Phenomenon\nNow, since M is charged under the gauge field, it is acted upon by gauge transformations. Consequently, any solution to the \"ramified\" SW equations with M = 0 represents a\n\u2032\n\nfixed, singular point in Mxsw \u2013 the space of all solutions modulo gauge transformations. As\n\nsuch, it would \u2013 as in the case with Donaldson theory [11] \u2013 result in a jump in SW (x\u2032 ) as\n\none crosses a \"wall\" while moving in the space of metrics on X. In other words, SW (x\u2032 ) will\nfail to be a topological invariant if there is a nontrivial solution to F+\u2032 = 0 \u2013 the \"ramified\"\nabelian instanton. Let us ascertain when such a nontrivial \"ramified\" abelian instanton\nexists.\nAs (F \u2032 /2\u03c0) \u2208 H 2 (X, Z), the condition F+\u2032 = 0 implies that F \u2032 /2\u03c0 lies at the intersection\n\nof the integral lattice in H 2 (X, R) and its anti-self-dual subspace H 2,\u2212 (X, R). As long as\n2\nb+\n2 \u2265 1, so that the self-dual part of H (X, R) is non-empty, the intersection in question just\n\nconsists of the zero-vector. Hence, for a generic metric on X, there are no \"ramified\" abelian\ninstantons.\nNonetheless, for SW (x\u2032 ) to qualify as a genuine topological invariant, it will mean that\nalong any path that connects two generic metrics on X, there cannot be a \"ramified\" abelian\ninstanton. This can fail for b+\n2 = 1, as in this case, the dimension of the self-dual subspace\nof H 2 (X, R) is one, and in a generic one-parameter family of metrics on X, one may meet a\nspecial metric whereby the above-mentioned intersection is non-zero, such that SW (x\u2032 ) can\nthen jump. Let us analyze how this happens (following [5]), assuming for simplicity that\nb1 = 0 and b2 = b+\n2 = 1.\nEven though the equation F+\u2032 (A\u2032 ) = 0 has no solutions for a generic metric on X, we\nwould like to investigate what happens when we are close to a special metric where there\nis one. To this end, let us parameterize the family of metrics on X by \u01eb, such that at a\n\"wall\" where \u01eb = 0, we have a solution A\u20320 to F+\u2032 (A\u2032 ) = 0. In other words, at \u01eb = 0, there\nis a solution A\u2032 = A\u20320 and M = 0 to the \"ramified\" SW equations. What we would like to\nstudy, is the solution to the equations for a nearby metric corresponding to a small, non-zero\n\u2032\n\n\u01eb. At this point, note that one has dxsw = 0 precisely if the index \u2206 of the Dirac equation\nis 1. Therefore, there is generically a single (non-zero) solution M0 of the Dirac equation\nP i\ni \u0393 Di M = 0 at \u01eb 6= 0. As such, near \u01eb = 0, we can write the solution to the equations at\n9\n\n\f\u01eb 6= 0 as A\u2032 = A\u20320 + \u01eb\u03b4A\u2032 and M = mM0 , where m is a complex number, and\ni\nFij\u2032+ (A0 ) + \u01eb(d\u03b4A\u2032 )+\nij + mmM 0 \u0393ij M0 = 0.\n2\n\n(2.13)\n\nSince b1 = 0, it will mean that one can always make a choice of \u03b4A\u2032 which is d-exact.\nMoreover, since F+\u2032 (A0 ) = 0 at \u01eb = 0, it will mean that F+\u2032 (A0 ) is proportional to \u01eb. Hence,\n(2.13) can also be written as\nc\u01eb = |m|2 ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere c is some constant.\nClearly, since |m|2 is always positive, it will mean from (2.14) that for b1 = 0 and\n\n\u2032\nb+\n2 = 1, the number of solutions SW (x ) to the \"ramified\" SW equations will jump by +1 or\n\n\u22121 as one crosses a \"wall\" in going from \u01eb < 0 to \u01eb > 0, depending on the sign of c.\n\nLast but not least, at the \"wall\" where F+\u2032 = 0 is supposed to be a solution of the\n\u2032\n\n\"ramified\" SW equations, we must have dxsw \u2265 0. Since F+\u2032 = 0 means that \u2217x\u2032 = \u2212x\u2032 ,\n\n(where \u2217 is the Hodge-dual operator), we also have x\u2032 2 < 0. Then, for b1 = 0 and b+\n2 = 1,\nwe find that\n\n(2 +\n\n\u0001\n\u03c3\n) \u2264 \u03b12 D \u2229 D \u2212 2\u03b1l \u2212 2k < 0.\n4\n\n(2.15)\n\nHence, for \"ramified\" SW wall-crossing to occur at a particular metric on X, the corresponding values of \u03b1, D \u2229 D, l and k must obey the inequality above. In particular, the location of\nthe \"wall\" will now depend on the parameter \u03b1.\n\n2.3. Properties of the \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Invariants and their Basic Classes\nProperties of the \"Ramified\" SW invariants\nLet us now explore the properties of the \"ramified\" SW invariants through some vanishing theorems. As a start, let us first schematically write the \"ramified\" SW equations as\nF+\u2032 = \u03c6(M) and D\n/ M = 0. Next, note that from the coupled Lichnerowicz formula [12], we\nhave\n1\n1\nD\n/ \u2020D\n/ M = D \u2020 DM + R * M + (F+\u2032 \u22c6 M),\n4\n2\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere Di = \u2202i + wi + A\u2032i is the covariant derivative with respect to the spin and gauge connections wi and A\u2032i , R is the scalar curvature of X, and \u22c6 denotes the Clifford multiplication.\nNote that the adjoint of the (twisted) Dirac operator D\n/ \u2020 acts on sections of S \u2212 \u2297 L\u2032 , that\nis, M. Also, note that since M (unlike F ) is a non-singular (monopole) field, there will not\n10\n\n\fbe any surface contributions along D in the integral over X of its (covariant) derivative.\nAltogether, this means that we can write\nI=\n\nZ\n\nX\n\n\u221a\n/ M|2 =\nd x \u1e21 |D\n4\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n4\n2\nd x \u1e21 |DM| + R * |M| + |M| ,\n4\n4\nX\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that (\u03c6(M) \u22c6 M) = 21 |M|2 * M. In the above, |\u03a9|2 = h\u03a9, \u03a9i,\n\nwhere h, i is the inner product relevant to the field \u03a9.\n\nSince we have, at the outset, assumed that F+\u2032 = \u03c6(M) in writing I, the vanishing of\n\nD\n/ M and hence I, would then correspond to a solution of the \"ramified\" SW equations. In\nparticular, for R > 0, a solution would be given by M = 0 and F+\u2032 = 0. For b+\n2 \u2265 2, we have\n\nalready seen that there are no nontrivial solutions to F+\u2032 = 0. In other words, for manifolds\n\n\u2032\nX with positive scalar curvature and b+\n2 \u2265 2, we have SW (x ) = 0. This statement holds for\n\nall values of \u03b1; in particular, for \u03b1 \u2208 Z, that is, when \"ramification\" is effectively absent,\n\nour observation just reduces to that of the ordinary SW invariants established in [5]. On\n\u2032\nthe other hand, for b+\n2 = 1, there can be nontrivial solutions to F+ = 0 at a \"wall\". Hence,\n\nif the condition (2.15) is satisfied, SW (x\u2032 ) 6= 0 for some metric on X with b1 = 0, b+\n2 = 1\nand positive scalar curvature.\n\nWhat can we say when X has R = 0? Let us consider a perturbation of the \"ramified\"\nSW equations, which now read F+\u2032 = \u03c6(M) \u2212 \u03c1+ and D\n/ M = 0, where \u03c1+ is a perturbation\nself-dual harmonic two-form like F+\u2032 ; the data of the perturbed \"ramified\" SW equations can\nthen be identified with a point in the space of pairs (\u1e21, \u03c1+ ) on X. Next, perturb the metric\n\u1e21 to another metric \u1e21 \u2032 . Altogether, I will be replaced by\n!\n\u221a\nZ\np\np\n2\n1\nI\u2032 =\nd4 x \u1e21 \u2032 |D\n|M|2 * |\u03c6(M) \u2212 \u03c1+ | .\n/ M|2 =\nd4 x \u1e21 \u2032 |DM|2 + R * |M|2 +\n4\n4\nX\nX\n(2.18)\nZ\n\nIf R > 0, we find from I \u2032 that a possible solution would be M = 0 and F+\u2032 = \u2212\u03c1+ . However, a\ngeneric choice of \u03c1+ cannot coincide with F+\u2032 itself; as such, there are generically no solutions\n\nwhen R > 0. Nevertheless, for R = 0, notice that there is a solution given by DM = 0\nand \u03c6(M) = \u03c1+ . In other words, this solution is characterized by a \"ramified\" abelian\ninstanton F+\u2032 = 0, and a covariantly-constant M and thus \u03c1+ . For all \u03c1+ \u2208 H 2,+ (X, Z) to\nbe covariantly-constant, X must either be K\u00e4hler with b+\n2 = 1 (such that one can actually\nmeet a solution of F+\u2032 = 0 for some (\u1e21 \u2032 , \u03c1+ )) or is hyper-K\u00e4hler. Therefore, we find that\nthe (perturbed) \"ramified\" SW invariants are non-zero on scalar-flat K\u00e4hler manifolds with\nb+\n2 = 1, and on hyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds. Indeed, as shown in [13], one can find scalar11\n\n\fflat K\u00e4hler metrics on non-minimal ruled surfaces with b+\n2 = 1. Moreover, hyper-K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds are necessarily scalar-flat.\nThe \"Ramified\" SW Invariants for Connected Sums\nSuppose that X is the connected sum of two manifolds N \u2032 and N \u2032\u2032 \u2013 that is, X = N \u2032 #N \u2032\u2032 ,\n+\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nwith both b+\n2 (N ) \u2265 1 and b2 (N ) \u2265 1. We wish to ascertain SW (x ) on such an X. Since\n\nSW (x\u2032 ) is supposed to be a topological invariant, the result will be unaffected if we stretch\n\nthe cylinder which connects N \u2032 and N \u2032\u2032 in X. The topology of the elongated cylinder is given\nby S 3 \u00d7[0, 1], and can thus be arranged to have R > 0, since S 3 has positive scalar curvature.\n\nBased on our earlier analysis, there are no solutions to the \"ramified\" SW equations along\nthe cylinder. This means that solutions to the \"ramified\" SW equations on X must come\nonly from solutions on N \u2032 and solutions from N \u2032\u2032 . This means that the moduli space of\nsolutions on X will be given by\nMX = MN \u2032 \u00d7 MN \u2032\u2032 .\n\n(2.19)\n\nNote that any Chern class of the line bundle L\u2032 over X is given by the Chern class of L\u2032\nover N \u2032 plus the Chern class of L\u2032 over N \u2032\u2032 . Likewise for the signature \u03c3(X). Note also that\n\u03c7(N \u2032 #N \u2032\u2032 ) = \u03c7(N \u2032 ) + \u03c7(N \u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 2. Altogether, this means from (2.3) that\ndimMX = dimMN \u2032 + dimMN \u2032\u2032 + 1.\n\n(2.20)\n\nSince we are interested in the case where dimMX = 0, it must mean that either dimMN \u2032\nor dimMN \u2032\u2032 has (virtual) dimension \u22121, that is, it is empty.3 In turn, we find from (2.19)\nthat MX is also empty. Therefore, SW (x\u2032 ) = 0 on X.\n\nAbout the Basic Classes x\u2032\nWe shall now demonstrate that there are only a finite number of choices of x\u2032 that give\nrise to non-zero SW (x\u2032 ). To begin, first note that for SW (x\u2032 ) to be non-zero, I in (2.17)\nmust be zero, that is,\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n2\n4\nd x \u1e21 |DM| + R * |M| + |M| = 0.\n4\n4\nX\n4\n\n(2.21)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nRecall that because b+\n2 \u2265 1 for either N or N , it will mean that for a generic metric, there are no\n\u2032\n\"ramified\" abelian instantons F+ = 0 and hence, no solutions to M = 0. Consequently, MN \u2032 and MN \u2032\u2032 are\nboth smooth manifolds with non-negative (virtual) dimension. As such, they will be empty if found to have\nnegative (virtual) dimension.\n3\n\n12\n\n\fThis implies that\n1\n4\n\nZ\n\nX\n\n4\n\n|M| \u2264\n\nZ \u0012\nX\n\n1\n|DM| + |M|4\n4\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n=\n4\n\nZ\n\n1\n(\u2212R) * |M| \u2264\n4\nX\n2\n\n\u0012Z\n\nR\nX\n\n2\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012Z\n\nX\n\n|M|\n\n4\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere we used the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the last step.

The \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Invariants on K\u00e4hler Manifolds\nWe shall now specialize to the case where X is K\u00e4hler, and ascertain the (perturbed)\n\"ramified\" SW invariants. To this end, we shall adopt a strategy similar to that employed\nin [5].\n3.1. The Moduli Space of The \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Equations On K\u00e4hler Manifolds\nConstraint on the Embedding D in K\u00e4hler Manifolds\nIf X is K\u00e4hler and spin (as assumed at the outset), then M = S + \u2297 L\u2032 has a decomposition S + \u2297 L\u2032 \u223c\n= (K 1/2 \u2297 L\u2032 ) \u2295 (K \u22121/2 \u2297 L\u2032 ), where K is the canonical bundle and K 1/2\n\nis its square root. (If X is K\u00e4hler but not spin, S + \u2297 L\u2032 can still be decomposed as stated.\nHowever, K 1/2 and L\u2032 can no longer exist separately, and K 1/2 \u2297 L\u2032 must be characterized\nas a square root of the line bundle K \u2297 L\u2032 2 .)\n\n13\n\n\fLet us denote the components of M in K 1/2 \u2297 L\u2032 and in K \u22121/2 \u2297 L\u2032 as \u03be and \u2212i\u03b2\u0304,\n\nrespectively. The equation F+\u2032 = \u03c6(M) can now be decomposed as\nF \u20322,0 = \u03be\u03b2\n\u0001\n\u03c9\n\u2032\nF\u03c91,1 = \u2212 |\u03be|2 \u2212 |\u03b2|2\n2\nF \u20320,2 = \u03be \u0304\u03b2\u0304.\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u2032\n\nHere, \u03c9 is the K\u00e4hler form and F\u03c91,1 is the (1, 1) part of F+\u2032 . Consequently, (2.17) can be\nwritten as\nIk\u00e4hler =\n\nZ\n\nX\n\n\u221a\nd x \u1e21 |D\n/ M|2 =\n4\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\nd x \u1e21 |D\u03be| + |D\u03b2| + R * (|\u03be| + |\u03b2| ) + (|\u03be| + |\u03b2| ) .\n4\n4\nX\n(3.2)\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nAs before, solutions to the \"ramified\" SW equations would be such that the right-hand-side\nof (3.2) vanishes. Notice that for non-zero \u03be and/or \u03b2, there can only be solutions to the\nequations (for non-flat F \u2032 ) if R < 0. This agrees with our earlier observation that SW (x\u2032 )\nvanishes on manifolds with positive scalar curvature.\nConsider the map\nA\u2032 \u2192 A\u2032\n\u03be\u2192\u03be\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u2212\u03b2.\nNotice that the above map is a symmetry of the right-hand-side of (3.2). This means that\nfor some value of \u03be and \u03b2 that (3.2) is zero, that is, for some solution of the \"ramified\"\nSW equations, the above map gives another zero of (3.2) and hence, another solution to the\n\"ramfied\" SW equations. Notice, that the two solutions related by the map can satisfy (3.1)\nonly if \u03be\u03b2 and \u03be \u0304\u03b2\u0304 are zero, that is,\nF \u20322,0 = F \u20320,2 = 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis means that the connection A\u2032 defines a holomorphic structure on L\u2032 . The basic classes\nx\u2032 = \u22122c1 (L\u2032 ) are therefore of type (1, 1) for any K\u00e4hler structure on X.\n\nThis constraints the number of admissible embeddings D of the surface operator in X:\n\nwe find that there can only be a total of h1,1 = b2 \u2212 2h2,0 instead of b2 choices of D among the\n\nlinearly-independent two-cycles in (the torsion-free part of ) H2 (X, Z) if it is K\u00e4hler, where\nhp,q = dim[H p,q (X, R)].\n14\n\n\f\u2032\n\nThe Moduli Space Mxsw\n\u2032\nIf \u03be\u03b2 (or \u03be \u0304\u03b2\u0304) is to vanish whilst F\u03c91,1 6= 0, it would mean that either \u03be = 0 and \u03b2 6= 0,\n\nor \u03be 6= 0 and \u03b2 = 0. Consequently, the second of the \"ramified\" SW equations will read\n \u0304\non L\u2032 \u2013 that is, \u03be and \u03b2 are\n\u2202 \u0304A\u2032 \u03b2 = 0 or \u2202 \u0304A\u2032 \u03be = 0, respectively, where \u2202 \u0304A\u2032 is the \u2202-operator\n\nholomorphic sections of the appropriate bundles when they do not vanish.\nLet us now consider the case where \u03b2 = 0. (The discussion involving \u03be = 0 is more or\nless identical; one just has to replace L\u2032 with L\u2032 \u22121 throughout our proceeding discussion).\nThen the space of connections A\u2032 and sections \u03be of the bundle K 1/2 \u2297 L span a symplectic\nmanifold, with symplectic structure defined by\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\nh\u03b41 A , \u03b42 A i =\n\u03c9 \u2227 \u03b41 A\u2032 \u2227 \u03b42 A\u2032\nXZ\n\u0001\n \u0304 1\u03be .\nh\u03b41 \u03be, \u03b42 \u03bei = \u2212i\n\u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 \u03b41 \u03be\u03b42 \u03be \u2212 \u03b42 \u03be\u03b4\n\n(3.5)\n\nX\n\nOn this symplectic manifold acts the group of U(1) gauge transformations. The moment\nmap \u03bc for this action is the quantity that appears in the (1, 1) equation of (3.1), that is\n\u2032\n\n\u03bc\u03c9 = F\u03c91,1 + \u03c9|\u03be|2.\n\n(3.6)\n\n\u2032\n\nConsequently, the moduli space Mxsw can be obtained by setting to zero the above moment\n\nmap and dividing by the group of U(1) gauge transformations. This should be equivalent to\n\ndividing by the complexification of the group of gauge transformations. In the case at hand,\nthe complexification of the group of gauge transformations acts by \u03be \u2192 \u03bb\u03be, \u2202 \u0304A\u2032 \u2192 \u03bb\u2202 \u0304A\u2032 \u03bb\u22121 ,\nwhere \u03bb is a map from X to C\u2217 .\n\nConjugation by \u03bb has the effect of identifying any two A\u2032 's that define the same complex\n\u2032\n\nstructure on L\u2032 . Hence, Mxsw is the moduli space of pairs consisting of a complex structure\non L\u2032 , and a non-zero holomorphic section \u03be of K 1/2 \u2297 L\u2032 that is defined up to scaling.\n\nFurthermore, if X has b1 = 0, then the complex structure on L\u2032 (if it exists) is unique.\n\u2032\n\nMxsw will then be a complex projective space, PH 0 (X, K 1/2 \u2297 L\u2032 ). Nevertheless, since \u03be is\n\u2032\n\nholomorphic, by the maximum modulus principle [14], \u03be is constant. Consequently, Mxsw\n\nconsists only of a single point for the canonical basic class x\u2032 = x\u2032c = c1 (K).\n3.2. The \"Ramified\" Seiberg-Witten Invariants on K\u00e4hler Manifolds\nThe Basic Classes x\u2032\n15\n\n\fRecall from our analysis at the end of the previous section that there are only a finite\nnumber of x\u2032 's. Generalizing the analysis in \u00a74 of [5] to the \"ramified\" case, (which simply\n\ninvolves replacing the ordinary U(1)-bundle in [5] with L\u2032 ), we learn that the x\u2032 's correspond\n(possibly in a one-to-many fashion) to the independent global sections of the canonical line\nbundle K of (2, 0)-forms on X. In other words, the total number of independent basic classes\nx\u2032 will be given by dim[H 0 (X, K)], at most.\nThe (Perturbed) \"Ramified\" SW Invariants\nx\u2032\n\nSince Mswc consists only of a single point when b1 = 0, it will mean from (2.5) that the\n\n\"ramified\" SW invariant for the canonical basic class x\u2032c is just the sign of the determinant of\nT . For K\u00e4hler manifolds X with b+\n2 (X) > 1, the expression for the sign of the determinant of\ng (x\u2032 ) = (\u22121)w ,\nT is the same as in the ordinary case \u2013 that is, the perturbed SW invariant SW\nc\n\nwhere w = dimC [KerT ]. In order to see this, one just needs to repeat the arguments laid out\n\nat the end of \u00a74 of [5] after replacing the ordinary U(1)-bundle therein with L\u2032 .4 Since the\n\nrelevant computation is based on a standard treatment which involves mildly deforming the\ndeterminant of T to the Ray-Singer-Quillen determinant, we shall, in favor of brevity, not\nrepeat it here.\ng (x\u2032 ) may depend on the additional\nAt any rate, it should be emphasized that SW\nc\n\nparameters \u03b1, l and D \u2229 D: notice that w = dimC [KerT ] depends on the index of T , which,\n\nin turn, is expressed in terms of these parameters. Nevertheless, since w is necessarily an\ng (x\u2032c )'s for (hyper)-K\u00e4hler manifolds with b1 = 0 and b+\ninteger, the SW\n2 > 1, are given by\n\u00b11.\n\ng (x\u2032 ) on \u03b1, l and D \u2229 D\nExplicit Dependence of SW\n\ng (x\u2032 )'s on the surface\nAscertaining the explicit dependence of w and hence of the SW\n\noperator parameters \u03b1, l and D \u2229 D, is in general difficult, as one can usually compute\n\nonly the index of T and not its (co)kernel alone. Nevertheless, in certain special cases, the\ng (x\u2032 )'s on the above surface operator parameters can be made manifest.\ndependence of the SW\n\nFor example, for ruled surfaces given by an S 2 -bundle over a Riemann surface \u03a3g of\n\ngenus g, the scalar curvature R is positive (for a metric where S 2 is small) and b1 = 2g.\nIt also has b+\n2 = 1, and thus, one can find a solution to F+ = \u2212\u03c1+ = 0 for some special\n\npair (\u1e21, \u03c1+ )s ; this implies that there can be wall-crossings, since M = 0. The wall-crossing\n\nformula of the ordinary perturbed SW equations has been determined in [15], and since the\n4\n\nTo arrive at this result, we have also made use of the fact that the moduli space of the perturbed SW\nx\u2032\nequations for the basic class x\u2032c \u2013 like Mswc \u2013 consists of a single point only.\n\n16\n\n\fordinary perturbed SW invariants vanish in some chamber in the space of pairs (\u1e21, \u03c1+ ) when\nR > 0, the wall-crossing formula in [15] actually gives us the exact non-zero expression of\nthe ordinary perturbed SW invariants for some other pair (\u1e21 \u2032, \u03c1\u2032+ ) in an adjacent chamber.\nAs the \"ramified\" SW equations are just the ordinary SW equations with the ordinary U(1)bundle replaced by L\u2032 , and since the perturbed \"ramified\" SW invariants also vanish in some\nchamber in the space of pairs (\u1e21, \u03c1+ ) when R > 0 (as argued in \u00a72.3), their non-zero values\n\nfor some other pair (\u1e21 \u2032, \u03c1\u2032+ ) in an adjacent chamber will be given by (cf .

Nevertheless, as we shall see when we consider an explicit\ng (x\u2032 ).\nexample below, all parameters can be made manifest in the final expression of SW\n\ng (x\u2032 ) is not necessarily equal to \u00b11 unless g = 0 \u2013 this is consistent with our earlier\nAlso, SW\n\nanalysis, where we showed that for b1 = 0 and b+\n2 = 1, the \"ramified\" invariants will jump\nby \u00b11.5\n\n3.3. Some Explicit Examples\nThe Invariants on K3\nLet us consider a closed hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold X such as K3 which has b1 = 0, b\u00b1\n2 (X) >\n1 (and R = 0). Then \u03c7(X) = 24 and \u03c3(X) = \u221216. Consequently, x\u2032 2 = 2\u03c7 + 3\u03c3 = 0; that\nis, there is only one basic class for K3 \u2013 the trivial one x\u2032c = c1 (K). This is indeed consistent\n\nwith the fact that dim[H 0 (K3, K)] = 1, where K is trivial. From our above discussion, we\nhave\ng K3 (0) = \u00b11.\nSW\n\n(3.8)\n\nBecause b+\n2 (X) = 3, there are no wall-crossings, and the above result holds for all metrics\non K3. Thus, the perturbed \"ramified\" and ordinary invariants coincide up to a sign (see\nTheorem 3.3.2 of [16]). In addition, we find that there are h1,1 = 20 admissible choices of\nembeddings D of a surface operator in K3.\n5\n\nActually, we showed this to be true of the unperturbed invariants at the end of \u00a72.2. Nevertheless, one\ncan generalize the analysis to include the perturbation two-form \u03c1+ , whereby \u03c1+ necessarily vanishes at\n\u01eb = 0, as this is where the intersection of the integral lattice in H 2 (X, R) with its anti-self-dual subspace\nH 2,\u2212 (X, R) is non-zero. In doing so, one will obtain a similar conclusion \u2013 that the perturbed invariants will\njump by \u00b11 in crossing a \"wall\", if b1 = 0, b+\n2 = 1.\n\n17\n\n\fThe Invariants on T4\nLet us consider another (and the only other) closed hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold X such as T4\n\u20322\nwith b\u00b1\n2 (X) > 1 (and R = 0) . Since \u03c7(X) = 0 and \u03c3(X) = 0, we have x = 2\u03c7 + 3\u03c3 = 0;\n\nthat is, there is only one basic class for T4 \u2013 the trivial one x\u2032c = c1 (K). This is indeed\nconsistent with the fact that dim[H 0 (T4 , K)] = 1, where K is trivial. From our above\ndiscussion, we have6\ng T4 (0) = \u00b11.\nSW\n\n(3.9)\n\nBecause b+\n2 (X) = 3, there are no wall-crossings, and the above result holds for all metrics\non T4 . Hence, the perturbed \"ramified\" and ordinary invariants coincide up to a sign (see\nTheorem 3.3.2 of [16]). In addition, we find that there are h1,1 = 4 admissible choices of\nembeddings D of a surface operator in T4 .\nThe Invariants on P2\n2\n1,1\nNow consider a K\u00e4hler manifold X with b+\n2 (X) = 1 such as P . Since h (X) = 1,\n\nthere is a unique choice of embedding D of the surface operator in P2 . Because X has\nR > 0, we have SWP2 (x\u2032 ) = 0 for some metric.7 However, since b+\n2 (X) = 1, there can be\nwall-crossings. Nevertheless, since b1 (X) = 0, the condition (2.15) for wall-crossings to occur\n\u2212\nis simply b\u2212\n2 > 9. Since b2 (X) < 9,\n\nSWP2 (x\u2032 ) = 0\n\n(3.10)\n\nfor any metric on P2 .

Then, b+\n= N + 1 \u2013 hence, there are N + 1\n2 (X) =1 and h\n\nadmissible choices of embeddings D of the surface operator in X. However, because X has\nR > 0, SWP2 \u266fN P2 (x\u2032 ) = 0 for some metric. Nevertheless, since b+\n2 (X) = 1, there can be\nwall-crossings. However, as b1 (X) = 0, the condition (2.15) for wall-crossings to occur is\n\u2212\nsimply b\u2212\n2 > 9.

Then b1 (X) =\n\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2g, b+\n2 (X) = b2 (X) = 1, and \u03c7(X) = 4(1\u2212g). In addition, we have S \u2229S = \u03a3g \u2229\u03a3g = 0, and\ng S2 \u00d7\u03a3 (x\u2032 ) = 0 for\n\u03a3g \u2229S2 = 1.

If\n\nD = S2 , from (3.7), the perturbed \"ramified\" SW invariants will, at some pair (\u1e21 \u2032, \u03c1\u2032+ ) in an\nadjacent chamber in the space of pairs, be given by\nSWS2 \u00d7\u03a3g (x\u2032 ) = \u00b1[l]g ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nas S2 \u2229 S2 = 0. On the other hand, if D = \u03a3g , we have\nSWS2 \u00d7\u03a3g (x\u2032 ) = \u00b1[p]g ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nfor some integer p, since F \u2032 /2\u03c0 \u2208 H 2 (X, Z).\n\nNotice that the dependence on the self-intersection number D \u2229 D is not manifest in the\n\nabove formulas; this is because for the above choices of D, we have D \u2229 D = 0. Nevertheless,\n\nsince the intersection form matrix of a four-manifold X is real, symmetric and unimodular,\none can always diagonalize it using an orthogonal matrix; in other words, one can always\nfind a basis of homology two-cycles {Ui }i=1,...,b2 (X) in (the torsion-free part of) H2 (X, Z),\n\nsuch that Ui \u2229 Uj = ni \u03b4ij for non-zero integers ni , whereby \u03a0i ni = \u00b11; consequently, there\nare b2 (X) possible choices for D with D \u2229 D 6= 0 \u2013 namely, Di = Ui for i = 1, . . . , b2 (X).\n\nIn this case, the h1,1 = b2 = 2 admissible choices D1 and D2 will be given by D1 =\n\na * S2 + b * \u03a3g and D2 = c * S2 + d * \u03a3g for non-zero real numbers a, b, c, d, such that ad = \u2212bc;\n\n2ab = \u00b11; 2cd = \u00b11; and Di \u2229 Dj = ni \u03b4ij for integers ni obeying n1 * n2 = \u00b11. Also, one\n\ncan express S2 = m * D1 + n * D2 for non-zero real numbers m, n, such that ma = 1 \u2212 nc and\nmb = \u2212nd. Hence, from (3.7), the perturbed \"ramified\" SW invariants with nontrivially-\n\nembedded surface operators D1 and D2 will, at some pair (\u1e21 \u2032, \u03c1\u2032+ ) in an adjacent chamber in\n\nthe space of pairs, be given by\n\u2032\ngi 2\nSW\nS \u00d7\u03a3g (x ) = \u00b1\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n[li + ri [c1 (L)](\u03a3g )] \u2212 ki \u03b1i (Di \u2229 Di )\nqi\n19\n\n\u0013g\n\n,\n\n(3.14)\n\n\fwhere i = 1, 2, {q1 , q2 } = {a, c}, {r1 , r2 } = {b, d}, {k1 , k2 } = {m, n}, li =\nR\n[c1 (L)](\u03a3g ) = \u2212 \u03a3g F/2\u03c0.\n\nR\n\nDi\n\nF/2\u03c0, and\n\nThe explicit dependence of the perturbed \"ramified\" SW invariants on the monopole\n\nnumbers li , holonomy parameters \u03b1i and self-intersection numbers Di \u2229 Di of the two ad-\n\nmissible surface operators, are manifest in the above formula. Clearly, from (3.12), (3.13)\nand (3.14), we see that the perturbed \"ramified\" and ordinary invariants do not necessarily\n\ncoincide on a general product ruled surface with g > 0.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nI would first and foremost like to thank C.
