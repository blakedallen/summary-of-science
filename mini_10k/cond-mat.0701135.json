To unravel the mechanism, identifying the underlying pairing symmetry would\nbe the first step. The two-dimensional triangle lattice\nformed by CoO2 provides an alternative lattice symmetry\nto the square CuO2 lattice in high Tc materials and has\nled to many proposals for unconventional pairing symmetries. For singlet pairing, the lowest possible unconventional symmetry without breaking rotational symmetry\nis dx2 \u2212y2 \u00b1 idxy , and mechanism based on the correlation effects for such symmetry has been proposed[2, 3, 4].\nPossible spin-triplet f -wave pairing was also proposed\nbased on ferromagnetic fluctuations[5, 6, 7]. Experimentally, however, data reported show contradictory\nconclusions[8], indicating the fragility of the superconductivity in this system. Furthermore, there are evidences indicating that two pairing symmetries may be\ninvolved in this system [9, 10, 11]. The issue of whether\nthe pairing symmetry is conventional or not is still unsettled and needs to be clarified.\nIn this paper, we shall focus on the data of the upper\ncritical fields, measured by the specific heat. The specificheat technique probes the bulk properties of the samples\nand has been proved to be a powerful tool for investigating the pairing state of many superconductors[12].\nSpecifically, for the hydrate cobaltate Na0.35 CoO2 *yH2 O,\nupward curvature (a kink structure in the slope) of Hc2\nwas observed [9, 10]. Similar structure was also observed\nin early studies of high Tc materials[13]. Based on the\nGinzburg-Landau theory, Joynt[14] attributed the upward curvature to the transition between two different\npairing symmetries with different critical temperatures.\nHowever, in a later investigation based on microscopic\nformulation of the gap equation [15], negative results\nwere found, indicating that the upward curvature is not\n\ndue to mixing of two pairing order parameters. The reason why two approaches give different results lies in the\nfact that in the Ginzburg-Landau theory, Hc2 \u221d T \u2212 Tc\nand phenomenologically, both Tc and slopes of Hc2 are often chosen arbitrarily. If larger slope of Hc2 is chosen for\nsmaller Tc , Hc2 of two pairing symmetries near their Tc 's\nessentially shows the intersection of two straight lines. A\nkink in the slope thus arises and the upward curvature\ncan be easily simulated. In real materials, however, the\nslope of Hc2 and Tc both depend on microscopic details\nand are not independent from each other. In fact, in the\nGorkov's microscopic derivation of the Ginzburg-Landau\nequation[16], the slope is proportional to m\u2217 Tc /\u01ebF with\nm\u2217 being the effective mass of the electron and \u01ebF being the Fermi energy. For a single band, m\u2217 /\u01ebF are the\nsame for different pairing symmetries, hence smaller Tc\ngoes with smaller slope, in the opposite trend adopted\nin the Ginzburg-Landau equation. Hence in this case,\njoining two pairing symmetries with different Tc would\nnot yield the upward curvature. This picture essentially\nexplains why the upward curvature is not reproduced in\nthe calculation of Kim et al. [15] for high Tc materials. Then, what is the origin for the upward curvature in\nhydrate colaltate ? It is known that multi-orbitals near\nthe Fermi surface might be involved for the occurrence\nof superconductivity[17]. Hence m\u2217 /\u01ebF can no longer be\ntreated as a fixed parameter for different pairing symmetries if different pairings occur on different bands. Indeed, our calculation in below shows that upward curvature feature can result from the two-band calculation in\nwhich different values of m\u2217 /\u01ebF are assumed for different\nenergy bands where different pairing symmetry occurs.\nFurthermore, mixing of different pairing symmetries results in coupling of the ground state to different Landau\nlevels in the presence of magnetic fields and causes different upward curvatures. By direct comparison of experimental data with Hc2 obtained by mixing of the lowest\n\n\f2\npossible pairing symmetries, it is possible to pin down\nthe pairing symmetries of the system. We find that the\nupward curvature observed in the experimental data is\nmostly consistent with a transition of the pairing symmetry from s to dx2 \u2212y2 + idxy .\nWe start by first considering pairing that occurs in two\nbands. The two-dimensional BCS-like Hamiltonian can\nbe written as\n\u0124 =\n\n2 X\nX\n\n\u03beki \u0108k+i \u03c3 \u0108ki \u03c3\n\ni=1 ki ,\u03c3\n\n+\n\nXX\n\ni,j ki ,kj\u2032\n\n+\nVki kj\u2032 \u0108k+i \u2191 \u0108\u2212k\n\u0108\u2212kj\u2032 \u2193 \u0108kj\u2032 \u2191 ,\ni\u2193\n\n(1)\n\nwhich was first investigated by Suhl, Matthias, and\nWalker[18]. Here k1 and k2 are wave vectors on two\nFermi surface sheets indexed by 1 and 2. The electronelectron interaction Vk1 k\u20321 and Vk2 k\u20322 are the intrasheet\ncontributions and Vk1 k\u20322 is an intersheet contribution. In\ngeneral, the superconducting pairing symmetry is different for different band. Hence we can write the projection\nof the interaction in the form Vk1 k\u20321 = V\u03b1 \u03c6\u0302\u03b1 (k1 )\u03c6\u0302\u2217\u03b1 (k\u20321 ),\nVk2 k\u20322 = V\u03b2 \u03c6\u0302\u03b2 (k2 )\u03c6\u0302\u2217\u03b2 (k\u20322 ), and Vk1 k\u20322 = VI \u03c6\u0302\u03b1 (k1 )\u03c6\u0302\u2217\u03b2 (k\u20322 ).\nHere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are indices for the pairing symmetry. \u03c6\u0302\u03b1 (k)\nis an operator that projects out the corresponding pairing symmetry \u03b1. For the lowest possible pairings, we\nshall consider possible mixing of p and f waves for triplet\npairing and mixing of s and d for singlet pairing. For the\ntriangle lattice, assuming that the rotational symmetry\nis not broken, the appropriate p and d pairing amplitudes\nare px \u00b1 ipy and dx2 \u2212y2 \u00b1 idxy . The corresponding projection operators are \u03c6\u0302s (k) = 1, \u03c6\u0302p\u00b1ip (k) = k\u0302x \u00b1 ik\u0302y ,\n\u03c6\u0302d\u00b1id (k) = k\u0302x2 \u2212 k\u0302y2 \u00b1 2ik\u0302x k\u0302y , and \u03c6\u0302f (k) = k\u0302x3 \u2212 3k\u0302x k\u0302y2 .\nNote that there are two possible f -waves; however, since\nthey are related by a rotation of \u03c0/6 and it suffices to\nconsider one of them (see below for details).

We find that\nthe transition from s-wave at low fields to d + id at high\nfields is the best fit to the data. In Fig. 1, we show numerical results of Hc2 for the transition from s-wave at\nlow fields to d + id at high fields in comparison with experimental data obtained by specific-heat measurement.\nThe fitting parameters are the ratio of Fermi velocities\nvFs /vFd+id = 0.8, Tcd+id /Tcs = 0.5, \u03bes = 4.3, \u03bed+id = 0.89,\nand \u03b3 = 1.1. These values are in reasonable regime. The\nclose fitting ro the experimental data clearly shows that\nsinglet pairing dominates in hydrate cobaltat, which is\nalso consistent with recent NMR data[20]. Furthermore,\nit implies that two energy bands are involved and supports results based on LDA calculations[17] where two\nbands constructed from the three Co t2d orbitals intersect the Fermi level.\n\nHC2(Tesla)\n\ns to d+id\nExperimental Data\n\n5.0\n\n0.0\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\nT(K)\n\nFIG. 1: The comparison of experimental data of Hc2 [9] with\nnumerical results based on the transition from s-wave at low\nfields to d + id at high fields.\n\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the origin for the\nupward curvature of the upper critical field (Hc2 ) observed in hydrate cobaltate Na0.35 CoO2 * yH2 O. Analysis\nbased on the microscopic gap equation shows that the\nobserved upward curvature results from the transition\nbetween two different pairing symmetries that occur on\ndifferent energy bands. Furthermore, it is found that the\ntransition of the pairing symmetry from s-wave at low\nfields to dx2 \u2212y2 + idxy at high fields is the best fit to the\nexperimental data.\nThis work is supported by the NSC of Taiwan.
