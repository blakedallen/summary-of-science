To test this assumption, we obtained Chandra X-ray data\nof the starbursting spiral NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group of galaxies, a candidate\nfor a strong galaxy interaction with hot intragroup gas. The data reveal a shock-like\nfeature along the western edge of the galaxy and a low\u2013surface-brightness tail extending to the east, similar to the morphology seen in other wavebands. Spatially resolved\nspectroscopy shows that the data are consistent with intragroup gas being pressurized\nat the leading western edge of NGC 2276 due to the galaxy moving supersonically\nthrough the intragroup medium at a velocity \u223c 850 km s\u22121 .

With a total mass loss rate of \u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , the galaxy\ncould be losing its entire present Hi supply within a Gyr. This demonstrates that the\nremoval of galactic gas through interactions with a hot intragroup medium can occur\nrapidly enough to transform the morphology of galaxies in groups. Implications of this\nfor galaxy evolution in groups and clusters are briefly discussed.\nKey words: galaxies: evolution - galaxies: individual: NGC 2276 - galaxies: interactions - galaxies: spiral - X-rays: galaxies - X-rays: galaxies: clusters\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere is a long standing argument about which processes are the key ones in modifying the morphology\nof galaxies in dense environments, and establishing the\nmorphology-density relation and the associated truncation\nof star formation (see, e.g., Goto et al. 2003). Candidate\nprocesses for the morphological evolution of disc galaxies into lenticulars include ram pressure stripping, tidal\nstripping, galaxy harassment, strangulation, interactioninduced star formation, and major and minor mergers.\nOf these, the first two mechanisms have been extensively\nstudied using both observational (e.g. Vogt et al. 2004)\nand numerical approaches (Abadi, Moore & Bower 1999;\nStevens, Acreman & Ponman 1999; Quilis, Moore & Bower\n2000; Roediger & Hensler 2005). In particular, recent Hi\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jesper@star.sr.bham.ac.uk\n\nand X-ray observations of individual cluster galaxies have\nuncovered strong evidence for ongoing ram-pressure stripping (e.g. Vollmer et al. 2004; Wang, Owen & Ledlow 2004;\nSun & Vikhlinin 2005).\nWhile most studies of gas stripping have focused on\ngalaxies in clusters, including the statistical approach presented by Goto (2005), there is growing evidence that much\nof the modification of galaxy morphologies and truncation of star formation actually takes place in groups and\ncluster outskirts rather than in the dense cluster cores\n(Lewis et al. 2002; Helsdon & Ponman 2003; Gonzales et al.\n2005; Homeier et al. 2006). This has been interpreted by\nmany authors as ruling out the possibility that stripping via\ninteractions with a hot intracluster medium (ICM) plays a\nmajor role in morphological transformations, given that it\nis expected to be much less effective in poor systems than in\nthe cores of rich clusters. This interpretation remains to be\ntested by direct observations, however, and recently, claims\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Rasmussen, T. J. Ponman and J. S. Mulchaey\n\nhave been made for X-ray (Sivakoff, Sarazin & Carlin 2004;\nsee also Machacek et al. 2005b) and Hi (Bureau & Carignan\n2002; Kantharia et al. 2005) evidence of ram-pressure stripping in groups. But, as noted by these authors, ram-pressure\nstripping is not the only viable explanation for the gas morphology seen in these systems. One problem with assessing\nthe importance of ram pressure in these cases is that of obtaining robust constraints on the true 3-D velocity of the\ngalaxy through the intragroup medium.\nIn an attempt to investigate the efficiency of gas removal in groups, and in particular test whether gas stripping through ICM interactions can in fact be effective in\ngroup environments, we obtained Chandra data of the spiral NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group of galaxies. This\ngalaxy displays a disturbed optical morphology and constitutes another good candidate for a strong interaction with\nhot intragroup gas. NGC 2300 itself is the central elliptical in a sparse group catalogued with just four galaxies (Giudice 1999), this group being the first in which\nan X-ray emitting intragroup medium (IGM) was detected (Mulchaey et al. 1993). The peculiar morphology of\nNGC 2276 has also attracted attention, spawning detailed\nstudies of its optical, radio, and X-ray point source properties (Gruendl et al. 1993; Hummel & Beck 1995; Davis et al.\n1997; Davis & Mushotzky 2004). The distributions of optical light, Hi gas, and radio continuum emission in this\ngalaxy show a bow-shock\u2013like structure along the western\nedge, which may suggest a shocked gas component. If so,\nthe galaxy must be moving supersonically through the ambient IGM. Evidence supporting this interpretation is the high\nstar formation rate of NGC 2276 (\u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ; Davis et al.\n1997), with much of this starburst activity occurring along\nthe western edge, as expected if an interaction with the IGM\nhas triggered some of the star formation via ram pressure\ncompression of molecular gas.\nAlso, similarly to many of the Virgo cluster spirals\nshowing signs of ICM interactions (Cayatte et al. 1990),\nthere is evidence that NGC 2276 is deficient in Hi compared to spirals in the field. For an isolated spiral of the\nsame morphology and optical luminosity, the relation of\nHaynes & Giovanelli (1984) would predict an Hi content\nMHI,pred. \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , which is 2.2 times the observed amount of MHI,obs. \u2248 6.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (Young et al.\n1989; corrected to the adopted distance of 36.8 Mpc,\nsee below). This corresponds to an Hi deficiency, as defined by Verdes-Montenegro et al. (2001), of log MHI,pred. \u2212\nlogMHI,obs. \u2248 0.35, and suggests that NGC 2276 may already have lost a significant fraction of its original (i.e. prior\nto infall into the group) gas content.\nTo estimate the pressure conditions across the possible\nshock front and settle the question of whether a bow shock\nis really present in NGC 2276, X-ray data of high spatial\nresolution remain the only viable means. These can enable\nconstraints to be placed on the 3-D velocity of the galaxy\nand allow a test of whether the conditions for ram-pressure\nstripping are met. This is the goal of the present study. To\nthis end, we use Chandra data to map out the detailed spectral and spatial features of hot gas in and around NGC 2276\nand NGC 2300. Salient features of the observed group galaxies are listed in Table 1.\nAdopting H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , the distance to\nNGC 2276 is 36.8 Mpc (Tully 1988), with 1 arcmin cor-\n\nTable 1.

ID 4968) with the\nACIS-S3 chip as aimpoint, for an effective exposure time of\n45.8 ks, and with the CCDs at a temperature of \u2212120\u25e6 C.\nThe nearby group elliptical NGC 2300, which is the brightest\ngroup galaxy, was located on the S2 chip. The two other\ngalaxies in the group, NGC 2268 and IC 455, are not covered\nby this Chandra pointing. A fifth galaxy, UGC 03670, with\na distance to NGC 2300 of 16 arcmin (\u223c 170 kpc), has a\nredshift concordant with the other group galaxies and is\nprobably yet another group member. This galaxy is located\non the I3 chip; showing only very faint X-ray emission it will\nnot be discussed further here, where we will concentrate on\nthe emission on the S2 and S3 chips.\nData were telemetered in Very Faint mode which allows for a superior suppression of background events, so calibrated event lists were regenerated and background screened\nusing the acis process events tool in ciao v3.2. Bad pixels were screened out using the bad pixel map provided by\nthe pipeline, and remaining events were grade filtered, excluding ASCA grades 1, 5, and 7. Periods of high background\nwere identified using 3\u03c3 clipping of full-chip lightcurves,\nbinned in time bins of length 259.8-s and extracted in offsource regions in the 2.5\u20137 keV band for back-illuminated\nchips and in 0.3\u201312 keV for front-illuminated chips. These\nperiods were excluded from the data, leaving a cleaned exposure time of 44.2 ks. Blank-sky background data from the\ncalibration database were screened and filtered as for source\ndata.\nPoint source searches were carried out with wavdetect\nusing a range of scales and detection thresholds. Results\nwere combined, yielding a total of 112 detected sources, 75\nof which are located on the S2 and S3 chips used in this analysis. Source extents were quantified using the 4\u03c3 detection\nellipses from wavdetect, and these regions were masked\nout in all subsequent analysis.\nThe Chandra astrometry was checked against the op-\n\n\fGas stripping of NGC 2276\n\n3\n\ntical position of NGC 2300 as listed in NED, revealing no\nsignificant difference.\n\n2.2\n\nImaging and spectral analysis\n\nFull-resolution (0.5 arcsec pixel\u22121 ) adaptively smoothed,\nbackground subtracted images are shown in Fig. 1. To produce these, background maps were generated from blank-sky\ndata, and scaled to match the source count rates in source\u2013\nfree regions on the relevant chip. They were then smoothed\nto the same spatial scales as the source data and subtracted\nfrom the latter. The resulting images were finally exposure\ncorrected using similarly smoothed, spectrally weighted exposure maps, with weights derived from spectral fits to the\nintegrated diffuse emission. We stress that the resulting images served illustration purposes only and were not used for\nany quantitative analyses.\nAll spectra were accumulated in bins containing at least\n25 net counts and fitted in xspec v11.3 assuming the solar abundance table of Grevesse & Sauval (1998). For the\nabsorbing component we assumed the Galactic value of\nNH = 5.5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 from Dickey & Lockman (1990). Spectral response files were generated using the mkacisrmf tool\nin ciao v3.2, and all response products were weighted iteratively by a model of the incident source spectrum.\nWe employed two methods for generating background\nspectra. As IGM emission is expected to cover the S3 chip\nand thus must be subtracted from source spectra, background spectra for NGC 2276 were estimated from sourcefree regions on the same chip, described below. Since vignetting differences between the adopted source and background regions are small (\u223c 3 per cent at the peak spectral\nenergy of \u223c 0.7 keV for the region covered by the NGC 2276\ndisc), results are in any case likely to be dominated by statistical uncertainties. However, in cases where the properties\nof the IGM emission itself are of interest, we used blanksky background data to generate background spectra. These\ndata were scaled to match the 10\u201312 keV count rates of our\nsource data in off-source regions on the S3 chip. Since the\nassumed value of NH of our source data is a factor of \u223c 4\nlarger than the exposure-weighted mean value of the relevant\nblank-sky files, the background is likely to be overestimated\nat low energies with this method. Consequently, when using blank-sky data for background estimation, we restricted\nspectral fitting to the 0.7\u20135 keV band, within which no systematic residuals were seen.\nThe regions used for spectral extraction are shown in\nFig. 2, and a summary of fit results is provided in Table 2.\nA detailed investigation of the properties of hot gas in the\nelliptical NGC 2300 will be presented elsewhere.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nNGC 2276\n\nIn the 0.3\u20135 keV band, roughly 1500 net counts are detected\nfrom diffuse emission in the NGC 2276 disc (inside region A\nin Fig. 2). The X-ray contours of the diffuse emission, as\nrevealed by Fig. 1c, are clearly compressed at the western\nedge, demonstrating, as already indicated by earlier ROSAT\nHRI data (Davis et al. 1997), that also the hot gas in the disc\n\nFigure 2. Regions used for spectral fitting of NGC 2276. For clarity, excluded point source regions are not shown. Dashed box outlines the region used for extraction of on-chip background spectra.\n\ndisplays a disturbed morphology reminiscent of a bow-shock.\nA low\u2013surface-brightness tail extending to the south-east is\nalso visible. Smoothing the data to lower significances did\nnot reveal evidence of any additional features in the diffuse\nemission.\nThe smoothed image also shows evidence for diffuse\nemission extending beyond the western optical edge of the\ngalaxy. To investigate this in more detail, a surface brightness profile for the unsmoothed diffuse emission was extracted across the edge, inside the region shown as a dashed\nbox in Fig. 1c. The result is plotted in Fig. 3, revealing\na steep decline in X-ray surface brightness which coincides\nwith the edge of the optical disc. Interestingly, there is indeed evidence for excess emission immediately outside this\nedge, extending to a few kpc from the optical disc. We will\nreturn to this feature in Section 4.1.\nFor the spectral analysis, the background was evaluated\ninside the dashed box shown in Fig. 2. Since this region is\nfurther from NGC 2300 and hence the IGM emission peak\n(Davis et al. 1996) than NGC 2276 itself, any gradient in the\nIGM surface brightness would imply that we could be underestimating the background at the position of NGC 2276.\nTo test this, background spectra were also extracted from\nsmaller regions in the immediate vicinity of NGC 2276 (regions X in Fig. 2), but the spectral results for the disc emission were found to be indistinguishable at the 1\u03c3 level for\nall fitted parameters.\nA single-temperature fit to the disc emission (region\nA in Fig. 2) was found to be only marginally acceptable.\nGiven the vigorous star formation in the disc, there could\nbe a significant contribution from a population of unresolved\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries, or, as seen in many other starburst galaxies, evidence for a second thermal plasma component. We therefore also tried adding a power-law or a\nsecond thermal component, which both produced better fits\n(\u2206\u03c72 = 13.5 and 17.5, respectively, for 50 degrees of free-\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

We take the two-temperature model to be a representative parametrization of the integrated spectrum of diffuse\nemission. The total 0.3\u20132 keV luminosity of this emission\nis LX = 1.86 \u00b1 0.37 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 , and its spectrum and\nbest-fitting model are shown in Fig. 4a. We tested whether\nthe temperature derived for the hotter component was affected by residual emission from either low\u2013 or high-mass\nX-ray binaries, fixing this residual component to either a\n\u0393 = 1.5 power-law or a 7 keV thermal bremsstrahlung\nmodel (Irwin, Athey & Bregman 2003) for low-mass X-ray\nbinaries, or a \u0393 = 1 power-law for high-mass ones (e.g.\nvan der Meer et al. 2005). The best-fitting temperature for\nthe hotter gas component is in all cases consistent with\nthe value listed in Table 2, and the fitted models suggest\nthat unresolved X-ray binary emission accounts for only 10\u2013\n15 per cent of the total 0.3\u20132 keV flux. For the stellar mass\n\nof NGC 2276 listed in Table 1, this emission level is consistent with the value of LX \u2248 2 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 expected for a\npopulation of low-mass X-ray binaries (Gilfanov 2004).\nSpectra were also extracted for the east and west side\nof the disc separately (regions B and C in Fig. 2, selected\nso as to contain a similar number of net counts, \u223c 750 in\n0.3\u20135 keV). Fitting results are virtually identical for the two\nregions and are consistent with those derived for the X-ray\nbright W edge of the galaxy alone (region D). There is thus\nno spectral evidence that the hot gas in the W side of the disc\nis preferentially affected by external pressure and/or mixing\nwith IGM gas arising from the galactic motion through the\nIGM.\nWe note that the low abundances derived for the disc\ngas could be misleading, due to the well-known Fe-bias, arising when fitting the spectrum of a multi-phase gas with a\n\n\fGas stripping of NGC 2276\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nNGC 2276\n\n5\n\nIGM\n\nFigure 4.

For example, when\nallowing Z for the two-temperature model to vary, the result is consistent with supersolar abundances. This is testimony to the (anticipated) complexity of the spectrum, and\nthe fitted models should be considered convenient means of\nparametrizing the disc spectrum rather than a complete description of the physical state of hot gas in the disc.\n\nIGM\n\nIn order to validate the properties of the IGM emission as\nderived from earlier ROSAT studies, we modelled the 0.3\u2013\n2 keV surface brightness distribution on the full S3 chip\nalone, using an elliptical \u03b2\u2013model on top of a constant background, with NGC 2276 excised out to a radius of 1.5 arcmin. The appropriate exposure map was included in the\nfit, and the assumed peak of the emission was taken to\nbe the position reported by Davis et al. (1996). We find\n\u03b2 = 0.41+0.06\n\u22120.09 , rc = 4.0 \u00b1 1.8 arcmin, and S0 = 3.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7\n10\u22123 counts s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 , in excellent agreement with the\nROSAT result of Davis et al. (1996) (when correcting S0 for\nthe difference in effective area). With a best-fitting eccentricity of \u01eb = 0.28+0.12\n\u22120.15 and a major axis position angle consistent with an east-west orientation, the derived large-scale\nmorphology of the IGM emission is also qualitatively similar\nto the one found by Mulchaey et al. (1993) and Davis et al.\n(1996).\nFor the spectral analysis, source-free regions on the\nS2+S3 chips were defined, and spectra and responses were\nextracted separately for each chip. The spectra were fitted both individually for the two chips and jointly, with\nthe spectrum from the S3 CCD and its best-fitting model\nshown in Fig. 4b. A joint fit yields T = 0.85 \u00b1 0.04 keV\nand Z = 0.17+0.07\n\u22120.05 Z\u2299 . The derived temperature is in good\nagreement with the value of T = 0.97+0.11\n\u22120.08 keV obtained by\nDavis et al. (1996) from three combined ROSAT PSPC exposures of the group. For comparison to this earlier study,\nwe derive Z = 0.11+0.04\n\u22120.03 Z\u2299 using the abundance table of\nAnders & Grevesse (1989). This is also consistent with the\nresult of Davis et al. (1996), hence confirming the relatively\nlow abundance of this group. The good agreement with the\nspatial and spectral results of Davis et al. (1996) implies\nthat we can justifiably adopt their values for the peak IGM\ndensity and total IGM mass.\n\n\f6\n\nJ. Rasmussen, T. J. Ponman and J. S. Mulchaey\n\nTable 2.

The result, presented in\nFig. 5, shows that the X-ray tail persists, still showing an\noverall morphology in line with the expectation if the gas\ndistribution of the galaxy is affected by ram pressure caused\nby motion towards the west. Also shown in Fig. 5 are contours outlining the radio continuum emission in the galaxy\n(Davis et al. 1997), indicating the presence of a radio tail\ncoincident with that seen in X-rays. We will now proceed to\ninvestigate whether the overall X-ray and radio morphologies could indeed be indicative of the direction of motion of\nNGC 2276 in the plane of the sky.\n4.1\n\n(1039\n\nVelocity of NGC 2276 through the IGM\n\nThe distance from the IGM centre to the W edge of\nNGC 2276 is \u223c 70 kpc. The gas mass and \u03b2\u2013profile parameters derived by Davis et al. (1996) imply an IGM density\noutside the W edge of ne = 6 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 . Using\nTIGM \u2248 0.81 keV from Table 2, this then implies a thermal\nIGM pressure of PIGM \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 dyn cm\u22122 outside this\nedge, and a local sound speed vs \u2248 500 km s\u22121 .\nThe radial velocity difference \u2206vr between NGC 2276\nand NGC 2300, the two most massive group galaxies, is\n\u2206vr \u2248 420 km s\u22121 (Table 1).

Here M1 is the\nMach number of the galaxy's motion through the IGM, and\n\u03b3 is the adiabatic index. Note that equation (1) implies a\nmaximum density jump of n2 /n1 = 4 for a shocked \u03b3 = 5/3\ngas. Also note that both equations are strictly only valid\nfor the region immediately in front of the galaxy, where the\ngas velocity can be taken to be perpendicular to the shock\nsurface. For regions along the shock front further away from\nthe shock symmetry axis, the gas will encounter an oblique\nshock wave, inclined by an angle \u03c6 < 90\u25e6 with respect to the\ngalaxy velocity vector. In this case M1 should be replaced\nby M1 sin \u03c6 in equations (1) and (2) (see, e.g., chapter 9 in\nLandau & Lifshitz 1987).\nIs the diffuse X-ray emission from the W edge itself arising from a (shock)-compressed gas component? A low metal\nabundance is found for gas in the W disc, consistent with\nthe value derived for the ambient IGM. This could point\ntowards gas in the W disc being compressed IGM material\nrather than, e.g., starburst generated gas, but the Fe bias\ncould be important here, as the full-disc spectral fits indicate the presence of at least two gas phases. If assuming a\nface-on disc (Gruendl et al. 1993 constrain the inclination\nto 9\u25e6 < i < 17\u25e6 ) of thickness 2 kpc, the derived spectrum\nand flux of 5.9 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 imply a mean electron density of ne \u2248 0.018 cm\u22123 , a thermal pressure of\nPth \u223c 2ne T \u2248 3.1 \u00d7 10\u221211 dyn cm\u22122 , and a gas mass of\nM \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 for the western half of the disc. The\ncorresponding values for the east disc are very similar, implying a total hot gas mass of M \u2248 3.7 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and no\nlarge-scale hot gas flows inside the disc due to pressure imbalances. Adopting the single-temperature model of the disc\nemission, the lower T relative to the IGM value suggests that\nthis emission is not dominated by a shocked IGM. The density jump between IGM and disc gas of a factor \u223c 30 is\nalso much larger than can be achieved in a non-radiative\nshock, thus reinforcing this conclusion. As the temperature\nof the disc gas is typical of that inferred for starburst galaxies\nand since, for that temperature, both the X-ray luminosity\nand mass of this gas fall right on to the trends derived for\nstarburst galaxies (Read & Ponman 2001), emission inside\nthe W edge is most likely dominated by that of starburstgenerated gas, although some mixing with the ambient IGM\nmay have taken place.\nFig. 1c suggests evidence of X-ray emission beyond the\noptical W edge of NGC 2276. This component appears spatially distinct from the hot interstellar medium (cf. Fig. 3),\nand could arise predominantly from a compressed or even\nshocked IGM. A spectral fit to the emission immediately\noutside the W optical edge (region G in Fig. 5, corresponding to the two bins with excess emission in Fig. 3), gives\nT = 1.08+0.70\n\u22120.33 keV (for Z fixed at the global IGM value\nof 0.17 Z\u2299 derived for the S3 chip; best-fitting value is\n\u223c 0.5 Z\u2299 but statistics are too poor to obtain useful constraints on this quantity and neither the best-fitting T nor\n1\n\nAs is customary in the literature, we use subscripts 1 and 2\nto distinguish upstream from downstream quantities throughout\nthis paper.\n\nThermal pressure (dyn cm-2)\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3 + 2\u03b3M12 )(\u03b3 \u2212 1 + 2/M12 )\nT2\n=\n,\nT1\n(1 + \u03b3)2\n\n7\n\nShocked IGM?\n\nIGM\n\n10-11\n\nStarburst gas\n\n10-12\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nr (arcsec)\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 6. NGC 2276 pressure profile across the W edge.\n\nits errors are very sensitive to changes in the assumed Z).\nAlthough nominally higher, this temperature is still consistent with that of the ambient IGM, but is inconsistent\nwith the single-component value for the interstellar medium\n(ISM) in the disc. Moreover, comparing blank-sky and onchip background levels suggests that only one-third of this\nemission is from fore-/background IGM. Motivated by this,\nwe plot in Fig. 6 the thermal pressure corresponding to\nthe surface brightness plot shown in Fig. 3, assuming that\nmost of this emission immediately outside the W edge arises\nwithin a line-of-sight depth of . 20 kpc (\u2248 2rD , where\nrD is the disc radius). Intriguingly, there is evidence for a\nbuild-up of pressure immediately outside the optical disc,\nconsistent with a scenario in which the IGM in front of\nthe galaxy is being pressurized due to the motion of the\ngalaxy. For the assumed 20 kpc depth, we find a local mean\ndensity of ne \u2248 1.6 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm\u22123 and a pressure\nPth \u2248 4.8 \u00d7 10\u221212 dyn cm\u22122 in this region. This suggests a\ndensity jump of a factor n2 /n1 = 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 with respect to\nthe ambient IGM, indicating a shock, but a corresponding\njump in T cannot be unambiguously established from these\nresults alone.\nIf a shock front is present, gas immediately inside the\nMach cone will be affected also at some distance from\nNGC 2276. The asymptotic Mach angle \u03b1 (the cone opening angle with respect to the symmetry axis) should satisfy\nsin \u03b1 = M1\u22121 . An initial guess of \u03b1 \u2248 40\u201345\u25e6 , based on the\nX-ray and optical morphology of the W edge, would correspond to a mild shock of Mach number M1 \u2248 1.5. To help\nconstrain the temperature of gas inside this potential shock\nfront, we also considered regions outside the optical disc\nbut immediately inside the M1 \u2248 1.5 Mach cone (regions H\nin Fig. 5). Despite the fact that these regions are further\naway from the shock symmetry axis than the W edge and\nso should experience a smaller temperature jump (as mentioned above, due to M1 in equation 2 being replaced by\nM1 sin \u03c6, where \u03b1 < \u03c6 < \u03c0/2), we find T = 1.06+0.32\n\u22120.19 keV,\nwhich is still marginally inconsistent with the unshocked\nIGM value. In an attempt to maximize the S/N ratio and\nobtain tighter constraints on the post-shock temperature,\nwe performed a joint fit to the emission in these regions\n\n\f8\n\nJ. Rasmussen, T. J. Ponman and J. S. Mulchaey\n\nand that of the W edge (i.e. regions G+H in Fig. 5). We\nreadily acknowledge the fact that T is not expected to be\nuniformly raised across this region, but the result is expected\nto be dominated by statistical errors anyway. This approach\ngives T = 1.20 \u00b1 0.27 keV, thus strengthening the inconsistency with the local IGM value. The temperature jump\nbetween the putative shocked and unshocked regions is then\nT2 /T1 = 1.48\u00b10.28, in agreement with the expectation from\nequation (2) for an M1 \u2248 1.5 shock. For the derived density jump of n2 /n1 = 2.6 \u00b1 1.2, this result is also in formal\nagreement with the maximum ratio T2 /T1 = 2.6+3.8\n\u22121.3 predicted by equations (1) and (2) for \u03c6 = 90\u25e6 . As a consistency check, we confirmed that the emission level in various\nregions upstream of the M1 \u2248 1.5 Mach cone (regions I)\nis consistent with that of the (background plus) local IGM,\nrendering it unlikely that our results for the two regions inside the Mach cone are substantially affected by inaccurate\nbackground subtraction.\nOne would also expect an increase in surface brightness across the edges of the Mach cone, but such a jump\nis not convincingly detected. However, this could be due to\ngeometrical effects. In particular, we suffer from not knowing the exact 3-D direction of motion of NGC 2276 and the\nresulting orientation of the Mach cone, which makes it nontrivial to provide a meaningful surface brightness plot for\nthe Mach cone corresponding to that presented in Fig. 3.\nAlso, when projected on to the sky, the surface brightness\nwill be continuous at a shock even though the gas density is\ndiscontinuous at the front, because shock fronts are invariably curved. Projection effects will therefore tend to smear\nout any sharp increase in the X-ray emission across the\nfront. Nevertheless, even after subtracting the best-fitting\nIGM surface brightness model from the data, we do detect\na clear enhancement in surface brightness inside the Mach\ncone (regions H in Fig. 5), which is found to be \u223c 80 per cent\nhigher than in regions immediately outside this cone (regions I). There is a corresponding jump in T , measured\nto be T = 0.78 \u00b1 0.10 keV in regions I, compared to the\n1.20 \u00b1 0.27 keV inside the Mach cone.\nThe data are thus consistent with a mildly shocked\nIGM. The density jump observed across the W edge, and\nthe temperature jump in this and the Mach cone regions,\ntranslate, via equations (1) and (2), into consistent Mach\nnumbers M1 = 2.4+1.8\n\u22121.1 and M1 = 1.5 \u00b1 0.3, respectively.\nCombining the information on density and temperature, one\ncan evaluate the shock (and hence galaxy) speed directly as\n(see e.g. Henry, Finoguenov & Briel 2004)\nvgal\n\n1\n=\n1 \u2212 n1 /n2\n\n\u0014\n\nkT1\n\u03bcmp\n\n\u0010n\n\n2\n\nn1\n\n\u0011\u0010T\n\n\u22121\n\nn1\n\u2212\nT1\nn2\n2\n\n\u0011\u00151/2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nyielding vgal = 784 \u00b1 103 km s\u22121 . The derived error on vgal\nis the dispersion resulting from 10,000 Monte Carlo realizations of equation (3), for which parameters were drawn from\na Gaussian distribution centred at their best-fitting values\nand having \u03c3 equal to the measured 1\u03c3 uncertainty. Nominally, the result implies a Mach number M1 = 1.54 \u00b1 0.20.\nHowever, several effects tend to make the measured\nvalue of the temperature jump smaller than it would be in\na simple, normal shock at the velocity of the galaxy. First,\nemission from unshocked gas projected into the line-of-sight\ncould reduce the measured temperature of the shocked gas.\n\nWe have attempted to reduce the impact of this effect by\nusing on-chip background estimates from unshocked regions\n(see Fig. 2). Second, in region G in Fig. 5, the shock strength\nshould vary quite significantly, since, as mentioned above,\nthe effective Mach number varies as sin \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the galaxy velocity vector and the shock front.\nThirdly, for the same reasons, the shock is almost certainly\nweaker for region H than in region G. The fact that we can\neven detect a temperature excess in region H almost certainly requires that the galaxy is moving considerably faster\nthan our simple estimate. Fourthly, the postshock pressure\nreturns quickly to the ambient gas pressure in the downstrean flow. Most of the gas begins to expand adiabatically\nand cool immediately behind the shock (gas close to the\nstagnation point at the leading edge of the galaxy is the\nexception). In combination, these effects will generally reduce the measured temperature jump. The derived jump\nwill therefore almost certainly underestimate the true Mach\nnumber of the galaxy relative to the IGM.\nIn addition, the actual Mach number is further underestimated due to projection effects. Given a line-of-sight velocity \u2206vr of NGC 2276 relative to the group, a sound speed\nvs , and the apparent (i.e. measured) opening angle \u03b1 of the\nMach cone projected on to the sky, the intrinsic Mach number M is given by\nM=\n\n[1 + (\u2206vr sin \u03b1)2 /vs2 ]1/2\n.\nsin \u03b1\n\n(4)\n\nUsing \u2206vr \u2248 420 km s\u22121 and \u03b1 \u2248 40\u201345\u25e6 , this corresponds to M \u2248 1.7. If adopting the fractional errors derived for equation (3) and adding these in quadrature to\nthose resulting from varying \u03b1 within the range 40\u201345\u25e6 ,\none finds M = 1.70 \u00b1 0.23, i.e. a pre-shock velocity of\nv1 = 865 \u00b1 120 km s\u22121 of the galaxy relative to the IGM.\nWe note, for the various reasons mentioned above, that the\nactual speed of the galaxy could be even higher, although\nthis is not easily quantified and may well be subsumed by\nthe large uncertainties. For the purposes of this paper, which\nis to investigate the importance of ram pressure, the 'deprojected' Mach number of M \u2248 1.7 should be a conservative\nchoice which we will consequently adhere to in the following. The implied density and temperature jumps from equations (1) and (2) are then n2 /n1 = 2.0 and T2 /T1 = 1.7,\nrespectively.\n4.2\n\nThe effects of ram pressure\n\nAssuming a shock is present, conservation of the mass flux\ndensity \u03c1ICM vgal perpendicular to the shock front implies\nthat the true ram pressure felt by the galaxy will be smaller\nthan that upstream of the front. For M = 1.7, the implied density increase of a factor 2.0 corresponds to a decrease in galaxy\u2013IGM velocity to vgal \u2248 430 km s\u22121 . This is\nthus the velocity v2 of post-shock gas immediately behind\nthe shock front. We note that the cooling time of this gas\nis \u223c 14 Gyr, thus justifying the non-radiative assumption\nunderlying equations (1) and (2). The resulting ram pres2\nsure Pram = \u03c1ICM vgal\n= \u03c12 v22 \u2248 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 dyn cm\u22122 ,\nwhich, combined with the increased thermal IGM pressure behind the shock front, yields a total IGM pressure\nPtot = Pram + Pth \u223c 9 \u00d7 10\u221212 dyn cm\u22122 . This is a factor\nof 3 less than the mean thermal pressure of the hot ISM in\n\n\fGas stripping of NGC 2276\nthe disc, at first suggesting that the morphology of hot disc\ngas would be only marginally affected by ram pressure.\nHowever, a more detailed treatment of the effects of ram\npressure, in particular the question of ram-pressure stripping, must take into account two additional considerations.\nOne is the gravitational restoring force per unit area of the\ndisc (Gunn & Gott 1972), F/A = 2\u03c0G\u03a3\u2217 \u03a3g , where \u03a3\u2217 and\n\u03a3g are the surface densities of stars and gas, respectively.\nThe classical condition for ram-pressure stripping to occur\n2\nthen becomes \u03c1ICM vgal\n> 2\u03c0G\u03a3\u2217 \u03a3g , i.e.\n\n\u0010\n\nne\ncm\u22123\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\nvgal\nkm/s\n\n\u00132\n\n& 100\n\n\u0012\n\nM\u2217\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\u0010\n\nMg\n0.1M\u2217\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\nrD\nkpc\n\n\u0013\u22124\n\n9\n\nTable 3. Adopted parameters of the galaxy model.

The validity of this estimate has been supported\nby results of numerical simulations (Abadi et al. 1999). The\nother issue to consider is that while the ram pressure itself is reduced at the shock, Pth + \u03c1v 2 remains conserved\n(for an inviscid fluid). Thus, the reduction in ram pressure\nbehind the shock front is balanced by in increase in static\n(thermal) pressure. Now, the difference between the static\npressure at the stagnation point, where the flow meets the\nleading edge of the galaxy, and the upstream thermal pressure is approximately equal to the upstream ram pressure.\nAs long as the galactic disc remains intact (and the effective\nReynolds number is reasonably high), a region of separated\nflow can be expected behind the disc, where the pressure is\napproximately equal to the downstream (i.e. ambient) gas\npressure. The quantity relevant to the issue of ram pressure\nstripping, the force per unit area acting on a disc normal to\nthe flow, is thus close to the pre-shock ram pressure.\nUsing therefore the pre-shock values of ne = n1 = 6 \u00d7\n10\u22124 cm\u22123 and vgal = v1 = 865 km s\u22121 in equation (5),\nalong with M\u2217 from Table 1, rD = 10 kpc, and Mg = 6.4 \u00d7\n109 M\u2299 (Young et al. 1989), one finds a ram-pressure falling\nshort of F/A by a factor \u223c 15. The central IGM density is\nonly a factor 1.7 larger than the value assumed, so using this\nvalue instead does not change the immediate conclusion that\nram pressure stripping should not have been an important\nfactor in the recent evolution of NGC 2276. Moreover, the\nassumed value of ne could be optimistic, as NGC 2276 could\nbe further away from the IGM centre than indicated by the\nprojected distance. However, the velocity dispersion of the\ngroup is \u03c3 \u2248 300 km s\u22121 (Mulchaey et al. 1993), in excellent\nagreement with the expectation from the \u03c3\u2013T relation for\nX-ray bright groups (Osmond & Ponman 2004). The larger\nvalues of both \u2206vr and vgal may suggest that NGC 2276 is\ncurrently passing through the group core, so we are probably\nnot making a large error in taking the projected distance to\nNGC 2300 as representative of the true distance to the IGM\ndensity peak.\nAn important caveat associated with the stripping criterion of equation (5) is that the gas is assumed to be held\nin place by a homogeneous disc thin enough to be described\nsolely by its surface density \u03a3. In order to provide a more\nrealistic picture of the effects of ram pressure, the calculation should be repeated as a function of radius R in the\ndisc midplane, and vertical disc height |z|, under suitable\nassumptions about the distribution of gas, stars, and dark\nmatter (DM). For this purpose, we set up a model of the\n\ngravitational potential \u03a6(R, z) of NGC 2276. We adopted\nthe model of Abadi et al. (1999) which consists of a spherical bulge with density profile\n\u03c1b (r) =\n\nMb\n1\n,\n2\u03c0rb2 r(1 + r/rb )3\n\n(6)\n\na spherical DM halo,\n\u03c1h (r) =\n\nMh \u03b7 exp(\u2212r 2 /rt2 )\n,\n2\u03c0 3/2 rt rh2 (1 + r 2 /rh2 )\n\n(7)\n\nand exponential stellar and gaseous discs, each of the form\n\u03c1d (R, z) =\n\nMd\nexp(\u2212R/Rd )sech2 (z/zd ).\n4\u03c0Rd2 zd\n\n(8)\n\nHere Mb , Mh , and Md are the total masses of each component, rb and rh are the scalelengths of the bulge and halo,\nrespectively, rt is the halo truncation radius, Rd is the cylindrical scalelength of the disc components and zd the corresponding thickness, and finally\n\u03b7 = {1 \u2212 \u03c0 1/2 q exp(q 2 )[1 \u2212 erf(q)]}\u22121 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere q = rh /rt and erf is the error function. We adopt\nagain the stellar mass M\u2217 from Table 1, a cold gas mass\nMg = 6.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , a hot X-ray emitting gas mass\nMhot = 3.7 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (cf. Section 4.1), and a bulge-to-disc\nstellar mass ratio of 0.25, appropriate for an Sc spiral like\nNGC 2276. In order to comply with the observed size of\nthe disc, the scalelength for the disc components have been\nfixed by the requirement that 90 per cent of all gaseous\nand stellar mass should lie within rD \u2248 10 kpc. A vertical scaleheight of 1 kpc was adopted for the X-ray emitting\ncomponent, representative of the values derived for galaxies of the mass and size of NGC 2276 in the disc galaxy\nsample of Strickland et al. (2004). The mass and truncation\nradius of the DM halo are then set by the requirement that\nthe maximum disc circular velocity vrot be within the ob\u22121\nserved limits of vrot \u2248 120+55\n(mean value from the\n\u221240 km s\nHyperLeda database). The adopted model parameters are\nlisted in Table 3, and Fig. 7 illustrates the contribution of\nthe various model components to the rotational disc velocity; the adopted model has a maximum rotational velocity\nof vrot \u2248 140 km s\u22121 at r \u2248 7 kpc, consistent with observations.\nThe restoring gravitational acceleration \u2202\u03a6\n(R, z) in the\n\u2202z\ndirection z perpendicular to the disc can be evaluated analytically for each model component using the equations\nof Abadi et al. (1999), to whom we refer for more details.\nAlso, the values of \u2206vr and (the pre-shock) vgal = v1 for\nNGC 2276 imply motion at an angle \u03be \u2248 29\u25e6 with respect\n\n\f10\n\nJ.

The shaded area outlines the region\nwhere galactic gas can be stripped by the derived ram pressure,\nlog Pram \u2243 \u22120.5. Dotted and dash-dotted lines mark the regions\noutside which Pram exceeds the thermal pressure of cold and hot\ndisc gas, respectively.\n\n(10)\n\nIn Fig. 8, we plot the left-hand side of equation (10)\nalong with the derived ram pressure. As was also found\nby Roediger & Hensler (2005) for their galaxy models, the\ngravitational restoring force in the outer disc (R & 5 kpc)\nis seen to be nearly independent of z for all interesting values of this parameter. The figure suggests that at present,\nram pressure alone is probably not powerful enough to remove large amounts of cold disc gas. But it also shows that\nthe inferred stripping radius, outside which Pram > F/A, is\nclose to 10 kpc for the adopted galaxy model, in excellent\nagreement with the observed truncation radius of cold and\nhot gas along the W edge of NGC 2276. Ram pressure could\ntherefore have played an important role in establishing the\npresent size of the gas disc.\nFig. 8 further illustrates the region outside which Pram\nexceeds the thermal pressure of the cold (T . 104 K) ISM\nnot immediately affected by star formation. Outside this region, one would expect the distribution of cold gas, such as\nthe H\u03b1 emitting disc gas, to be significantly modified by\nram pressure. Regarding the hot X-ray emitting ISM, Pram\nexceeds the thermal pressure of this gas at heights |z| & 1\u2013\n2 kpc above the disc. Starburst outflows would therefore be\nstrongly affected by ram pressure and could be swept away\nbefore having time to fall back on to the disc. Furthermore,\nif the X-ray emitting disc gas is mainly generated in stellar\noutflows, its distribution would at least initially follow that\nof young stars and hence that of the Hi out of which these\nstars are formed (recall that the Hi distribution is also compressed along the W edge). Such outflows will expand along\nthe steepest density gradient, which will be perpendicular to\nthe disc and thus close to a direction along the line of sight.\n\nWhen viewed in projection, the X-ray emission from stellar outflows may therefore retain the apparent compression\nalong the W edge both at early and late outflow stages.\nIt is instructive to also consider the effects of ram pressure on the hot coronal gas believed to surround at least\nmassive (vrot & 120 km s\u22121 ) spiral galaxies at low redshift\n(White & Frenk 1991; Toft et al. 2002; Birnboim & Dekel\n2003). This gas is assumed to provide the reservoir from\nwhich large disc galaxies are continuously replenishing the\ndisc gas consumed in star formation, and is essential to\nexplaining the extended star formation histories of isolated disc galaxies like the Milky Way. For a galaxy similar to NGC 2276, this gas component is expected to have\nT . 0.1 keV and LX . 1038 erg s\u22121 (Toft et al. 2002;\nRasmussen et al. 2006) and so would not be detectable in\nthe present data. With an expected warm/hot gas mass of \u223c\n108 M\u2299 outside the disc (Rasmussen et al. 2006), the mean\nthermal pressure of this gas will be P . 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 dyn cm\u22122\nfor a spherical corona of radius rD \u2248 10 kpc (log P . \u22121.35\nin the units of Fig. 8). While Fig. 8 indicates that a considerable fraction of this gas would remain bound in the galactic gravitational potential, ram pressure should disrupt its\ngradual inflow in this potential, preventing it from attaining\nthe densities necessary for rapid cool-out on to the disc (see\nAcreman et al. 2003). Effectively, this will eventually halt\nstar formation in the disc in a scenario identical to strangulation, but there is currently sufficient gas in the NGC 2276\ndisc for star formation to proceed at its present rate for at\nleast another Gyr.\nTransport processes could be more efficient than rampressure in removing gas from the galaxy. The expected mass\n\n\fGas stripping of NGC 2276\nloss rate due to viscous stripping via Kelvin-Helmholtz in2\nstabilities is \u1e40KH \u2248 \u03c0rD\n\u03c1ICM vgal (Nulsen 1982), i.e.\n\u1e40KH \u2248 0.1\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 n \u0011 \u0012 r \u00132 \u0010 v\nD\ne\ngal\ncm\u22123\n\nkpc\n\nkm s\u22121\n\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis would imply \u1e40KH \u2248 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the disc of\nNGC 2276. Note that, because \u03c1ICM vgal is conserved across\nthe shock front, the expected efficiency of viscous stripping\nis unaffected by the presence of a shock front. The viscous\nstripping efficiency is also largely insensitive to the orientation of the galaxy with respect to the direction of motion\n(Nulsen 1982; Quilis et al. 2000), unlike that of ram pressure\nstripping.\nThe mass loss rate due to thermal conduction of heat\nfrom the IGM to the ISM, whereby the colder disc gas is\nheated above the escape temperature of the galaxy (only\ncounteracted by radiative cooling), can be 3.5 times larger\nthan \u1e40KH (Nulsen 1982). But the efficiency of this process\nis uncertain due to the strong magnetic fields present in the\ndisc, as evidenced by the radio continuum emission (indicating a field strength roughly twice the average of spirals;\nHummel & Beck 1995). The fact that the large majority of\nthe ISM (\u223c 95 per cent) is in a cold phase suggests that conduction of heat from the IGM is not currently an important\nprocess.\nIn summary, these results indicate that shock compression can explain the presence of slightly denser and hotter\ngas outside the leading edge of galaxy, and that it could certainly exert a significant influence on the ISM, both in terms\nof establishing the size of the gas disc and compressing the\nHi and X-ray contours along the W edge, as well as helping\nto trigger the substantial star formation along this edge. In\nthis context it is also interesting to note the optical result of\nDavis et al. (1997) that the radial gradient in [Oiii]/H\u03b2 is\ntwice as steep on the western side compared to the eastern\nside of the disc, a result which could be attributed to gas in\nthe W disc being swept inward (potentially promoting the\ngrowth of a larger bulge). Starburst outflows would be swept\nback by ram pressure, and the cooling out of hot coronal gas\non to the disc would be inhibited. Ram-pressure, however, is\nprobably insufficient to strip large amounts of gas from the\ndisc, whereas hydrodynamic instabilities arising along the\nISM/IGM boundary could be removing ISM material from\nthe galaxy at a rate of several solar masses per year.\n\n4.3\n\nThe nature and origin of the X-ray tail\n\nThe presence of an X-ray tail extending eastwards from\nthe disc of NGC 2276 is established at the 3\u03c3 significance\nlevel, based on the enhancement in surface brightness within\nthis region relative to the on-chip background. While its\npresence is thus tentative rather than conclusive, the location of the tail matches that of a similar structure seen in\nboth Hi and radio continuum data (Hummel & Beck 1995;\nDavis et al. 1997). Only one clear-cut example of such an\nX-ray tail trailing a spiral in a poor group has so far been\nreported (Machacek et al. 2005a). The X-ray luminosity of\nthe NGC 2276 tail is \u223c 2 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 , about 10 per cent\nof that of the diffuse disc gas. The tail is not seen in the\noptical; in particular, there is no evidence from H\u03b1 data of\nongoing star formation in this region (Gruendl et al. 1993).\n\n11\n\nA single X-ray point source is detected at > 3\u03c3 significance\nin the tail, but statistics are too poor (\u223c 20 net counts) to\nallow a test of whether this is a background source.\nThe hot tail gas has a temperature T \u223c 0.8 keV, consistent with that of the surrounding IGM. Extending to a\ngalactocentric distance of \u223c 20 kpc, the tail gas should be\nessentially unbound from the galaxy, for which the characteristic escape temperature at this position is kTesc =\n2\n\u03bcmp vesc\n/3 \u2248 0.1 keV as derived from our galaxy model.\nIf the tail line-of-sight depth is \u223c rD \u2248 10 kpc, and assuming Z = 0.2 Z\u2299 , its density and hot gas mass are\nne \u223c 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm\u22123 and \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , respectively,\nwith both these numbers reduced by roughly a factor 2 for\na Z = Z\u2299 plasma. The galaxy moves a distance corresponding to the extent of the tail (\u223c 10 kpc at v2 = 430 km s\u22121 )\nin \u223c 20 Myr. If the entire mass of the X-ray tail represents\nunbound gas displaced from the disc due to the motion of\nNGC 2276, this would imply a mass loss rate averaged over\nthe disc of order \u1e40tail \u223c 3\u20136 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Of course, this relies\non the assumption that the speed of the tail (relative to the\ngalaxy) equals that of the shocked gas. However, as we will\nsee, a significant fraction of tail gas is likely to represent\nhot disc gas which has been heated and accelerated by the\nshock, supporting this assumption.\nFor the Hi tail, a rough estimate of its mass can be\nobtained from the Hi map of Davis et al. (1997). Using\nMHi \u2248 2.36 \u00d7 105 (D/Mpc)2 (FHi /Jy) (where FHi is the integrated Hi flux in the tail; see, e.g., Rosenberg & Schneider\n2002), we find MHi \u223c 4 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . Taken at face value, this\nwould correspond to a mass loss rate of \u223c 2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 of\ncold gas, assuming, as for the X-ray tail, that the galaxy\nhas moved a distance corresponding to the extent of the\ntail in \u223c 20 Myr. The Hi tail could therefore be accounted\nfor by viscous stripping. However, our mass model of the\ngalaxy suggests that this cold gas would remain bound in\nthe potential of NGC 2276. As our main focus is the gas that\ncan potentially be completely lost from the galaxy, we will\nconcentrate on the origin of the X-ray tail in the following.\nThere appear to be at least four potential origins for this\nhot tail: gravitationally focused IGM material (a \"wake\"),\ngas stripped off by ram pressure or other transport processes, starburst-driven outflows being swept back by the\nsame processes, or gas being tidally displaced by interaction\nwith NGC 2300 and/or the group potential. A robust metallicity constraint could help distinguish between these scenarios, but the tail metallicity is essentially unconstrained. One\nimmediately attractive explanation is that the tail results\nfrom viscous stripping, as the expected mass loss rate due\nto this mechanism is consistent with that inferred from the\nproperties of the tail. It is nevertheless instructive to consider alternative explanations, so below we will discuss these\ndifferent scenarios in more detail.\nWith spectral properties similar to those of the ambient\nIGM, the tail could be a wake of gravitationally focused IGM\nmaterial. Although in analytical theory large-scale wakes\nare unlikely to be produced by galaxies moving supersonically (Sakelliou 2000), the simulation results of Stevens et al.\n(1999) indicate that wakes can be created behind supersonic\n(group) galaxies. If so, they should be most easily observable in a relatively cool ICM (Stevens et al. 1999; Sakelliou\n2000). However, in order to produce an observable wake,\nthe accretion radius for Bondi-Hoyle accretion must exceed\n\n\f12\n\nJ. Rasmussen, T. J. Ponman and J. S. Mulchaey\n\nthe galaxy radius (Sakelliou 2000) which translates into the\nrequirement\nMgal > 8.7 \u00d7 1011\n\n\u0013\n\u0010 T \u0011\u0012 r\nD\nkeV\n\n10 kpc\n\nM\u2299\n\n(12)\n\nfor the total galaxy mass, i.e. Mgal & 8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 for the\nrD \u2248 10 kpc disc of NGC 2276. Given a stellar mass of\nM\u2217 . 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 (Table 1), it seems unlikely this requirement can be met unless NGC 2276 is enveloped in an\nunusually massive dark matter halo. This can probably be\nruled out by our rotation curve modelling, as the upper limit\nto vrot of 175 km s\u22121 suggests Mgal < 2.5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 for our\nadopted galaxy model. Another concern is that the tail gas is\nat least a factor of 2 denser than the surrounding IGM. For\nadiabatic accretion behind the galaxy, conservation of entropy, S = T /\u03c12/3 , would then predict a corresponding temperature ratio of Ttail /TIGM \u2248 1.6, which is not favoured by\nthe data. Consequently, while dedicated hydro-simulations\nwould be necessary to assess the feasibility of this scenario\nin detail, we tentatively conclude that the tail is unlikely to\nbe a wake.\nAnother explanation for the tail could be sought in a\ntidal interaction between NGC 2276 and NGC 2300. From\nthe morphology of NGC 2276, Hummel & Beck (1995) estimate that the time tapp since closest approach between the\ngalaxies is between half and one revolution of NGC 2276,\nabout 3 \u00d7 108 yr. Assuming NGC 2300 is at rest within the\ngroup potential, a lower limit to tapp can be obtained from\n2\nthe tangential velocity vt = (vgal\n\u2212 \u2206vr2 )1/2 of NGC 2276,\nwhich can be constrained to vt . 870 km s\u22121 , conservatively using our upper limit of M \u2248 1.9. This implies\ntapp & 80 Myr for a projected distance of 75 kpc. Assuming an average galactocentric distance of r \u2248 15 kpc, the\ndynamical time-scale for tail gas to recentre on NGC 2276\nis t = (2r 3 /GM )1/2 \u2248 160 Myr as derived from our galaxy\nmodel. Since this is larger than tapp , the tail could potentially be the remnant of an interaction with NGC 2300. An\nargument against this, however, is the fact that the mass\nof hot gas in the tail constitutes \u223c 15\u201325 per cent of all\nX-ray emitting gas in NGC 2276. If tidal interactions were\nresponsible for the tail, then a similar fraction of stellar light\nshould be deposited in a tidal tail. This is easily ruled out by\noptical observations. It is also curious that, if the tail is older\nthan 80 Myr, it has not been wound up as a result of taking part in the overall differential rotation of the NGC 2276\ndisc. Given vrot \u223c 120 km s\u22121 , the age constraint implies at\nleast a quarter of a full revolution since the time of closest\napproach with NGC 2300. It is hard to see how the observed\ntail morphology could survive for so long.\nA third possibility for the origin of the tail is related\nto the star formation rate of NGC 2276 of \u223c 2\u20135 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nas estimated from the relations of Kennicutt (1998) using\neither the H\u03b1 flux of Davis et al. (1997), or the far-infrared\nluminosity (calculated from IRAS 60 and 100 \u03bcm fluxes).\nHence, the tail could represent gas lost in starburst outflows\nwhich have subsequently been swept back by ram pressure.\nGiven the inclination of the galaxy, the presence of such outflows cannot be directly inferred from the present data. However, in the disc galaxy sample of Strickland et al. (2004),\nall galaxies having a surface supernova (SN) rate above\n40 Myr\u22121 kpc\u22122 also exhibit significant extraplanar X-ray\nemission, presumably resulting from starburst outflows. Us-\n\ning the same approach as Strickland et al. (2004), we find a\ncorresponding SN rate of 280 Myr\u22121 kpc\u22122 for NGC 2276.\nThis is comparable to values found for prototypical starburst outflow galaxies such as NGC 253 and NGC 1482,\nstrongly suggesting that outflows are also taking place in\nNGC 2276. Furthermore, the kinematics of H\u03b1 gas in the\ndisc is consistent with gas motion out of the plane of the\ngalaxy (Gruendl et al. 1993), and the observed steepening\nof the radio spectral index with frequency is consistent with\nadiabatic cooling in a galactic wind (Hummel & Beck 1995).\nIf we assume most of the tail gas originated along the\nstarbursting western edge where it was instantaneously accelerated to the post-shock velocity v2 , the typical timescale for this gas to reach the tail region would be \u223c\n45 Myr. Using the stellar population synthesis models of\nBruzual & Charlot (2003), we find that even a 10 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nstarburst of this age can easily be accommodated by the\npresent optical broad-band colours of NGC 2276. The resulting mass loss due to SN-driven outflows is not easily\nestimated, as it depends not only on the average mass expelled by each SN, but also on the amount of ISM swept up\nby the expanding hot bubbles (the 'mass-loading' of the outflow), and on the fraction of outflowing gas that can eventually escape the disc. However, observational studies of starburst outflows in spiral galaxies suggest that, at star formation rates below a few times 10 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , the mass outflow\nrate is comparable to the star formation rate (Martin 1999;\nRupke, Veilleux & Sanders 2005). This would suggest an upper limit to the outflow mass loss rate of \u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for\nNGC 2276. We therefore conclude that a scenario in which\nstarburst outflows are being swept back by ram pressure\nprovides a possible explanation for some, potentially all, of\nthe hot tail gas.\nThe X-ray tail thus does seem likely to be ISM displaced from the disc by transport processes. If the hot tail\ngas did indeed originate in the T \u2248 0.5 keV starburstgenerated gas that probably dominates the disc X-ray emission, one could ask whether any mechanism could heat hot\ndisc gas from this temperature to the tail temperature of\nTtail \u2248 TIGM \u2248 0.8 keV within the relevant time-scales.\nWe can first obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the\ntime-scales involved for conductive heating from the IGM,\nassuming heating between the above temperatures over a\nlength-scale of \u223c 5 kpc (from the projected edge to the centre of the tail). The scalelength of the temperature gradient\nlT = T /|\u2207T | \u223c 10 kpc, much longer than the electron mean\nfree path \u03bbe \u2248 0.3(T /keV)2 (ne /10\u22123 cm\u22123 )\u22121 kpc, which is\nat most a few hundred pc. Heat conduction at the Spitzer\nrate (Sarazin 1988) would then proceed on a time-scale\ntcond \u223c 0.2\n\n\u0010\n\nne\n10\u22123 cm\u22123\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\nlT\nkpc\n\n\u00132 \u0010\n\nT\nkeV\n\n\u0011\u22125/2\n\nMyr,\n\n(13)\n\nof order tcond \u223c 100 Myr. Given the complexity of the\nproblem, this is only a rough estimate, since gas would be\nheated while being displaced from the disc (changing lT ),\nturbulence could act to mix IGM and disc gas, and magnetic fields in and above the disc could be suppressing heat\nconduction by some unknown factor (cf. the presence of\ncold fronts observed in some clusters of galaxies, see, e.g.,\nVikhlinin, Markevitch & Murray 2001). While bearing these\ncaveats in mind, we note that the galaxy would have moved\n5 kpc in only \u223c 10 Myr, suggesting that the tail cannot be\n\n\fGas stripping of NGC 2276\nconductively heated gas as the time-scale for this is too long.\nFurther, if the tail were galactic gas heated by conduction,\nthen magnetic fields should be unimportant in the tail region, which appears inconsistent with the presence of significant radio continuum emission (Fig. 5). A more promising\nheating mechanism is shock heating, which could raise T by\na factor \u223c 1.7 (cf. equation 2), consistent with hot disc gas\nbeing heated from \u223c 0.5 to \u223c 0.8 keV. But heating may, in\nfact, not be required at all; a small fraction of tail gas could\nbe the very hot, tenuous component of starburst outflows\npredicted by hydrodynamical simulations of such outflows\n(Strickland & Stevens 2000).\nA plausible explanation for the X-ray tail is therefore\nthat it represents hot disc gas originating in supernova outflows, mildly shocked and removed from the disc by ram\npressure. We note that the tail is unlikely to be shock-heated\ncold disc gas, as the pressure of the cold ISM is larger than\nthe combined thermal and ram pressure of the IGM. A collision between a fragment of the cold, dense ISM and the\nIGM would form a shock in the latter rather than significantly heating the cold disc gas.\nSummarizing, the X-ray tail indicates a mass loss rate\nof \u1e40tail \u223c 3\u20136 M\u2299 yr\u22121 of hot gas. The two mechanisms\nof viscous stripping and starburst outflows could each be responsible for the loss of \u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 of gas, and so can each\nexplain the amount of hot gas in the tail. Other processes,\nsuch as tidal interactions or Bondi-Hoyle accretion, do not\nappear to be favoured by the data. The presence of an Hi tail\ncoincident with that seen in X-rays suggests that cold gas is\nalso being removed from the disc at a rate of \u223c 2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nprobably by viscous stripping rather than ram pressure. Our\nmass model of the galaxy suggests that this cold gas would\nremain bound in the potential of NGC 2276. This implies\nthat most (\u223c 60\u2013100 per cent) of the gas escaping the galaxy\nis in a hot phase, the exact fraction depending on how much\nof the Hi in the tail remains bound. We note that, owing\nto the strong dominance of Hi gas over X-ray gas in the\ndisc, most of the gas stripped by viscous stripping would be\nexpected to be in a cold phase. The overall picture could\ntherefore be one in which viscous stripping is mainly removing cold disc gas, whereas ram pressure acting on starburst\noutflows removes the hot starburst-generated gas, with some\nof the stripped gas being subsequently heated by shocks.\nFrom our X-ray data alone we cannot constrain the relative\nimportance of these two processes for the hot gas; the only\nsafe conclusion is that they could have a comparable impact. It seems possible, however, that star formation could\nhave an important indirect effect on the efficiency of viscous\nstripping, by making the hot disc gas more vulnerable to\nthe effects of hydrodynamical instabilities. Only dedicated\nsimulations could quantify the importance of this effect.\n4.4\n\nImportance of tidal interactions\n\nEvidence of gravitational interactions between NGC 2276\nand the nearby group elliptical NGC 2300 have been reported, suggesting that IGM interactions may not be solely\nresponsible for the observed features of this spiral (see\nGruendl et al. 1993; Davis et al. 1997). The aim of this section is to address the question of whether tidal interactions\nare really necessary to explain the features of NGC 2276, and\nif so, whether their importance can be constrained. This per-\n\n13\n\ntains mainly to the compression of the stellar and gaseous\nmaterial along the western edge, as we have just shown that\nthe eastern gas tail is unlikely to have a tidal origin.\nThere are essentially three separate claims of evidence\nfor an ongoing or past tidal interaction between NGC 2276\nand NGC 2300: (i) Forbes & Thomson (1992) claim that\nNGC 2300 has a tidal extension, interpreting this as evidence\nof a past interaction with NGC 2276; (ii) Gruendl et al.\n(1993) argue that certain peculiar features of the velocity\nfield of H\u03b1 emitting disc gas are hard to explain by ram\npressure and therefore must have a tidal origin; (iii) the\nfact that the stellar disc, in particular the older population of stars dominating the R-band light, has a truncated\ndistribution similar to that of the Hi and H\u03b1 emission, suggests that this could not have been induced by the present\nram pressure and so again must have a tidal origin. The\nclaims are backed by the more indirect arguments that ram\npressure is probably not strong enough to induce the observed peculiarities of NGC 2276, such as the truncation of\nthe stellar and gaseous discs and the enhanced star formation along the W edge. In line with this, the model results\nof Fujita & Nagashima (1999) suggest that ram-pressure\ncompression of gas cannot lead to an enhancement in the\nstar formation rate by more than a factor of 2, even for\ngalaxies falling through cluster centres. If so, the strong\nstar formation of NGC 2276 may require a tidal origin.\nTidal interactions can enhance the star formation rate (e.g.\nKennicutt et al. 1987), although it remains unclear whether\nthey can cause an order-of-magnitude increase as could be\nthe case for NGC 2276 (Mihos, Richstone & Bothun 1991).\nHowever, there are several lines of evidence which suggest that tidal interactions may not be essential to explaining the properties of NGC 2276. Firstly, assuming\nNGC 2300 is stationary in the group potential, it is questionable whether tidal interactions are really very efficient\nat a relative velocity of vgal \u223c 850 km s\u22121 . Secondly, the\ntidal extension of NGC 2300 reported by Forbes & Thomson\n(1992) is claimed to protrude towards the north-east, and is\nthus not in the direction of the present projected position\nof NGC 2276. Thirdly, regarding the peculiar velocity field\nof H\u03b1 gas in the disc of NGC 2276, as Gruendl et al. (1993)\nnote themselves, the kinematics of this H\u03b1 gas can also be\nexplained by gas motion out of the plane of the galaxy, and\nit is not strictly necessary to invoke a tidal origin. Given the\nvery likely presence of starburst outflows, this interpretation\nseems at least as attractive.\nAnother issue is the question of whether tidal interactions must be invoked to explain the truncation of the\nR-band light along the W edge, and whether the strong\nstar formation along this edge can be associated with such\ninteractions. It is clear that ram pressure compression of\nmolecular cloud complexes could lead to enhanced star formation along the W edge. If a factor \u223c 2 increase in\nthe star formation rate (SFR) can be obtained this way\n(Fujita & Nagashima 1999), then the SFR prior to the IGM\ninteraction should have been \u223c 1\u20133 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This is not an\nunreasonably high value, and observations of galaxies falling\ninto the cluster A1367 (Gavazzi et al. 1995) suggest that\nSFR enhancements at even stronger levels can indeed result\nfrom ICM interactions. Even more pertinent is the fact that\nthe time since closest approach with NGC 2300 is & 80 Myr\nand hence larger than the typical age of massive stars dom-\n\n\f14\n\nJ. Rasmussen, T. J. Ponman and J. S. Mulchaey\n\ninating the B-band light. The current high SFR is therefore\nunlikely to have been triggered exclusively by tidal interactions. As for the truncation of the stellar disc, if young stars\nare preferentially formed in regions where external pressure\ncontributes to the compression of molecular gas, then Bband and H\u03b1 light should trace the cold gas morphology, as\nobserved. The red and near-infrared light, arising predominantly from an older stellar population, could be truncated\nif the IGM interaction has persisted for sufficiently long, perhaps several 108 yr. There is a clear indication that also the\nJHK isophotes are compressed along the W edge (albeit far\nless strongly than the blue light). The position and derived\n3-D velocity of NGC 2276 implies that the galaxy has been\nwithin the group virial radius of \u223c 1 Mpc (Davis et al. 1996)\nfor at least \u223c 1 Gyr and possibly much longer. It therefore\nseems possible that NGC 2276 has experienced considerable\nram pressure for several 108 yr, so a tidal origin for the truncation of R-band light is not necessarily favoured over ram\npressure compression.\nTidal interactions should also lead to centrally\npeaked SFR enhancements (e.g., Keel et al. 1985;\nBarnes & Hernquist 1996; Bergvall, Laurikainen & Aalto\n2003), contrary to what is observed for NGC 2276. Even\nso, gas should recover from tidal distortions on a sound\ncrossing time-scale, which, even for a 5 kpc structure, is\nonly \u223c 10 Myr at the temperature of the hot ISM. This is\nfar shorter than the time since closest approach between\nNGC 2276 and NGC 2300, so only some long-lasting\ndynamical excitation triggered by the interaction could be\nmaintaining the W structure.\nFrom these arguments, it appears that the tidal scenario\non its own faces too many difficulties to be able to explain\nthe morphology of NGC 2276. We cannot rule out that gravitational effects have played a role in shaping the properties\nof this galaxy, but they seem unlikely to be dominant. On the\nother hand, a combination of ram-pressure (acting for several tens, perhaps hundreds, of Myr) and starburst outflows\nprovides a natural explanation for the enhanced star formation primarily along the W edge, the compression of radio,\nH\u03b1, broad-band optical/near-infrared, and X-ray isophotes\nalong this edge, the origin and properties of the eastern gas\ntail, and the H\u03b1 kinematics in the disc.\n\n5\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY\nEVOLUTION IN GROUPS\n\nThere is strong evidence (e.g. Jones, Smail & Couch 2000;\nBicker, Fritze-v. Alvensleben & Fricke 2002) that spirals in\nrich clusters of galaxies are transformed into S0 galaxies by\ninteractions with the cluster environment, a process underlying part of the well-known morphology\u2013density relation seen\nin clusters (but see also Burstein et al. 2005). The fact that\nsuch a relation exists also for groups (Helsdon & Ponman\n2003) shows that the underlying mechanisms are also at\nwork in group environments. The relation appears to be\nstronger in groups with a detectable hot intragroup medium\nthan in those without (Osmond & Ponman 2004), but this\nmay only reflect an increased efficiency of the relevant processes in collapsed systems, not necessarily a connection with\nthe presence of hot, dense gas.\nThe Hi deficiency of NGC 2276 mentioned in Sec-\n\ntion 1 suggests that this galaxy could already have lost an\namount of disc gas comparable to the current Hi supply of\n6.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , and that stripping processes are acting in this\nsystem. If the present mass loss rate of \u1e40tail \u2248 3\u20136 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nis representative, then NGC 2276 could have been losing Hi\nfor \u223c 1\u20132 Gyr (comparable to the sound crossing time of the\ngroup) and will have exhausted its supply in another \u223c 1\u2013\n2 Gyr. This indicates that galaxies in groups could lose all\natomic gas over the course a few Gyr as a result of gas stripping by the intragroup medium. While this is much slower\nthan in rich cluster cores, where such processes are expected\nfrom simulation results to take place on time-scales of tens\nof Myr (Abadi et al. 1999; Quilis et al. 2000), it could still\nbe sufficiently rapid to have made a significant impact on\nthe galaxy population in most groups that have now collapsed. This is particularly true for cluster galaxies, as these\nwere incorporated into groups first and can have experienced\nsuch interactions for a significant fraction of a Hubble time.\nA well-known example, whose origin could be at least partly\nexplained by such stripping processes, is the Hi deficient spirals seen in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster (Sanchis et al.\n2004).\nStar formation, interaction-induced or not, will contribute to exhausting the gas supply of spirals; for\nNGC 2276, the current star formation rate of \u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nsuggests that interaction-induced star formation may, at\nleast temporarily, be as important as stripping itself in exhausting the gas supply of spirals in dense environments\n(although some of the gas going into star formation will\nbe returned to the ISM on time-scales of \u223c 107 yr). The\nquestion remains whether such starburst activity is needed\nto facilitate gas loss from group galaxies. This cannot be\nunambiguously addressed by the present study, as both the\nobserved X-ray and Hi tails of NGC 2276 could be accounted\nfor by viscous stripping alone. An indication that starburst\noutflows are not a prerequisite for mass loss in groups is\nthe fact that certain group galaxies, such as Holmberg II\n(Bureau & Carignan 2002) and NGC 2820 (Kantharia et al.\n2005), also appear to be losing gas because of ram pressure\nor viscous stripping, without showing any signs of starburst\nactivity. A 22 ks ROSAT study with a limiting point source\nsensitivity of \u223c 1037 erg s\u22121 found no diffuse X-ray gas in\nHolmberg II (Kerp, Walter & Brinks 2002), implying that\nany X-ray tail of this galaxy is orders of magnitude fainter\nthan the 2 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 found for the NGC 2276 tail. However, based on its B-band luminosity of 1.3 \u00d7 109 L\u2299 (Tully\n1988) and the relation of Read & Ponman (2001), Holmberg II is expected to show a total diffuse X-ray luminosity\nof \u223c 2 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 . Any X-ray tail of this galaxy would\ntherefore likely remain undetected in the ROSAT data. Furthermore, since we are not aware of any dedicated X-ray\nstudies of the gas tail in NGC 2820, we cannot reliably compare the exact extent to which these two galaxies contain\nhot tail gas with our corresponding results for NGC 2276.\nIn the case of a fairly massive spiral like NGC 2276, another important effect of ram pressure is its ability to prevent any coronal gas from cooling out on to the disc. This\nwould eventually quench star formation by cutting off the\nsupply of fresh material for this process. Further, since the\nstripping radius will decrease with time, because gas is continuously lost from the galaxy via starburst outflows (hence\nreducing \u03a3g in equation 10), NGC 2276 would become in-\n\n\fGas stripping of NGC 2276\ncreasingly bulge-dominated with time. The indication, mentioned in Section 4.2, that gas in the W disc is currently\nbeing swept inward, suggests that the bulge itself could be\ngrowing at present. The end product would be a galaxy\nwith virtually no atomic gas, little star formation, a large\nbulge-to-disc ratio, and potentially a more luminous bulge.\nThese properties are similar to those of S0 galaxies, suggesting that ram pressure could be an important mechanism to\nform such galaxies. We note that the NGC 2300 group already harbours an S0 galaxy, IC 455 (Mulchaey et al. 1993),\nso whichever mechanisms are at work in the transformation\nof galaxies into S0's, they have previously been successful in\nthis environment. Thus, while there is evidence both for (e.g.\nVogt et al. 2004) and against (e.g. Goto 2005) ram pressure\ndriving the morphological evolution of cluster spirals into\nS0's, our results for NGC 2276 indicate that ram pressure\ncould at least be a contributing factor, even in environments\nwhere it was earlier thought to be inefficient.\nAnother class of objects worth mentioning in this context is the so-called 'E+A' galaxies, believed to be poststarburst galaxies which have had their starburst activity\nabruptly truncated within the past Gyr. The origin of this\nrapid halt to their star formation is poorly understood,\nbut as these galaxies are known to exist also in groups\n(Blake et al. 2004), they could have had their recent evolution affected by hot intragroup gas. However, our estimated\ntime-scale for stripping via IGM interactions in groups of\nseveral Gyr suggests that this process is too slow to provide an important route to forming such objects. This would\nbe consistent with recent results attributing the origin of\nE+A galaxies predominantly to galaxy-galaxy interactions\nand mergers (Yamauchi & Goto 2005).\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA 45 ks Chandra exposure of the spiral NGC 2276 in the\nNGC 2300 group of galaxies has revealed a shock-like feature along the western edge of the galaxy and a low\u2013surfacebrightness tail extending in the opposite direction. The Xray morphology of NGC 2276 resembles that seen at optical\nand radio wavelengths and is suggestive of supersonic motion of the galaxy through the ambient hot intragroup gas\nin a direction towards the west. X-ray imaging spectroscopy\nreveals evidence of a build-up of thermal pressure at the\nleading western edge of the galaxy, and the density and\ntemperature increase of this gas is consistent with the presence of a shock front due to the galaxy moving at Mach 1.7\n(\u223c 850 km s\u22121 ) through the surrounding medium. Diffuse\nX-ray emission with kT \u2248 0.5 keV is detected across the\noptical disc, and a number of X-ray bright point sources are\nseen along the W edge, where strong star formation activity\nis taking place. Contrary to previous claims, we conclude\nthat tidal interactions are not essential to explaining this\nstar formation activity, nor the morphology of the galaxy as\nseen across a range of wavelengths.\nIn order to investigate the effects of ram pressure resulting from the motion of NGC 2276 through the intragroup gas, we have modelled the gravitational potential of\nthe galaxy, and shown that the radius outside which gas\ncan be stripped by ram pressure corresponds well to the\nobserved radius of the gaseous and stellar disc. Ram pres-\n\n15\n\nsure stripping could therefore have dictated the present size\nof the disc. Whereas ram pressure itself is probably insufficient to remove significant amounts of cold disc gas from\nthe galaxy, turbulent viscous stripping could be removing\n\u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Due to the high star formation rate of the\ngalaxy, starburst outflows are very likely taking place as\nwell, although we cannot confirm this directly from the Xray data as the galaxy is viewed nearly face-on. We estimate\nthat such outflows could be responsible for an additional\nmass loss of no more than \u223c 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and that these\noutflows would also be strongly affected by ram pressure.\nAs the X-ray tail extending to the east of the galaxy would\nsuggest a mass loss rate of 3\u20136 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , this implies that\neither of these two mechanisms could explain the presence\nof this tail. A comparison to existing Hi data indicates that\ncold Hi gas is also being removed from the disc, but that\nmost of the gas stripped from the galaxy is currently in a\nhot phase.\nAt the present mass loss rate, the current Hi supply in\nthe disc of NGC 2276 would be exhausted within 1\u20132 Gyr.\nFrom the present Hi content, we further estimate that gas\nstripping could have been active for the previous \u223c 2 Gyr.\nHence on reasonably short time-scales \u2013 a small fraction of\na Hubble time \u2013 all Hi in this fairly massive spiral could be\nlost. This strongly suggests that the removal of galactic gas\nthrough interactions with the surrounding hot medium can\nbe effective in group environments, although, in this particular case, the process is expected to be slower than in cluster\ncores by two orders of magnitudes. A secondary effect of the\nram pressure experienced by NGC 2276 is that it will inhibit the cooling out of any hot coronal gas on to the disc,\nthus preventing the infall of fresh material for continuous\nstar formation. Combined with the gas loss, this implies that\nNGC 2276 would eventually evolve into an object with properties not too dissimilar from present-day S0 galaxies. Our\nresults therefore suggest that ram pressure could at least be\na contributing factor in the morphological evolution of spirals into S0's, even in environments where this mechanism\nwas earlier thought to be inefficient.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the referee for constructive and insightful comments.
