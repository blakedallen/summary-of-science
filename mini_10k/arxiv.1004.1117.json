Introduction\nIn an high-mass X-ray binary system (HMXB), the compact object is embedded in its companion's stellar wind\nand accretes from it. This environment can modulate\nthe observed X-ray emission if our line of sight probes\ndifferent parts of the wind \u2013 differing in, e.g., density\nand ionization state \u2013 along the binary orbit. As the accretion flow may depend on these properties of the wind\n\u2013 both are likely to differ, e.g., between the low/hard and\nhigh/soft states (e.g., Smith et al. 2002; Gies et al. 2003)\n\u2013 a thorough understanding of the wind is required for a\ncomplete picture of HMXBs and their state(-transition)s.\nDue to its persistent brightness, the HMXB Cyg X-1\nallows for a detailed study of its wind. Based on a Chandra-HETGS observation in 2003, Hanke et al. (2009) report a highly photoionized wind seen at orbital phase\n\u03c6 = 0.93\u20130.03 in the low/hard state; the high-resolution\nspectrum shows a multitude of absorption lines of H- and\nHe-like ions. Inhomogeneities in the wind \u2013 dense clumps\nat lower ionization stage \u2013 lead to absorption dips in the\nsoft X-ray light curve (Hanke et al. in prep.).\nWhile Chandra-HETGS is suitable for narrow absorption lines, other instruments are required to measure the\nbroad-band spectrum. Due to the violent variability during absorption dips, simultaneous observations are indispensable. We have therefore scheduled a joint multisatellite observation (comprising all X-/\u03b3-ray missions)\non 2009 April 18/19 (MJD 54 574/5) at \u03c6 = 0.97\u20130.21.\nAt this time, Cyg X-1 was in the low/hard state as well\n(see also Hanke et al. 2008).\n\nINTEGRAL\u2212IBIS (20\u221240 keV) count rate\n100\n\narXiv:1004.1117v1 [astro-ph.HE] 7 Apr 2010\n\nManfred Hanke1 , J\u00f6rn Wilms1 , Michael A.

Scattering of hard X-rays in the wind: The hard X-ray light\ncurves of Suzaku-PIN (blue) and INTEGRAL-IBIS (black) show a\nscattering trough around \u03c6=0.03, indicated by a linear fit (red).\nThe lowest count rate of this fit is 69 % of its highest count rate.\n\n2. Soft X-ray Absorption and (Hard) X-ray Scattering\nSimilarly to the Chandra observation in 2003, the soft\nX-ray light curves are shaped by several absorption dips\nwith complex substructure. This observation, however,\nextending to later phases, has revealed that dipping takes\nstill place at \u03c6 \u2248 0.2. Some of the dips are even apparent\nat higher energies and have been detected with RXTEPCA, Suzaku-PIN, and INTEGRAL-IBIS.\nThe Suzaku-PIN and INTEGRAL-IBIS light curves\n(in the 12\u201360 keV and 20\u201340 keV band, respectively)\n\n\f1\n\n0.5\u22121.5 keV 1.5\u22123 keV\n\n3\u22129 keV\n\nsoft\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n1\n(0.5\u22121.5 keV) / (1.5\u22123 keV)\n\nNH =1.8\n\u00d710 22c \u2212\nm2\n\u00d710 22cm \u22122\n\nprominent Fe K\u2212edge\n\nextreme dips\n\ndip spectrum\n\nNH =5.4\n\ndips\n\nDip / non\u2212dip ratio spectrum\n0.2\n0.5\n\nnon\u2212dip\n\n0.1\n\n(1.5\u22123 keV) / (3\u22129 keV) softness ratio\n0.5\n1\nha\nsoft\nrd\n\nshow a pronounced scattering trough extending over\n\u2248 9 h (see Fig. 1). Its minimum occurs at \u03c6=0.03 and\ncoincides with one of the deepest dips seen at lower energies, but the trough lasts much longer than the central\ndip. While the latter is caused by photoelectric absorption in a nearly neutral, dense clump in the wind, the\nformer might be associated with an ionized halo around\nthis clump. As the reduction by 31 % (corresponding to\n\u2206Ne = 6\u00d71023 cm\u22122 ) is removed until \u03c6 = 0.07, we exclude that it is caused by the orbital modulation in an\nhomogeneous \u2013 even if focused (Friend & Castor 1982)\n\u2013 wind. Conversely, the wind has to be quite clumpy, as\nthis \u2206Ne is almost the total column density of the wind.\nTime-resolved spectroscopy allows to infer the scattering trough even from the soft X-ray data: Fig. 2 shows\nthe XMM-Newton EPIC-pn light curve and fit parameters of spectra integrated over 48 s segments. The latter\nhave been divided by the non-dip spectrum (the average\nof the five spectra at highest count rate) and described\nwith an absorption model and a multiplicative constant,\nwhich gives a good fit to the 2\u201310 keV spectrum. The absorption measures the neutral column density in clumps,\nwhile the flux normalization factor \u2013 if due to Thomson\nscattering \u2013 measures the ionized column. The latter is\nremarkably accordant with the hard X-rays in Fig. 1.\nIn our scenario, the wind contains an ionized blob\n(causing the scattering trough), which has a larger core\nand a few smaller clumps being (at least: more) neutral.\n\nextreme dip spectrum\n\n0.5\n\n1\n2\n5\nEnergy [keV]\n\n10\n\nFig. 3. Suzaku-XIS color-color diagram (left) and spectra (right),\ndemonstrating the soft excess beyond pure neutral absorption.\n\n3. Covering Fraction of the Absorber\nSoft X-ray spectroscopy can reveal even more properties\nof the absorber during the dips. A color-color diagram\n(which completely ignores the scattering because of the\nratio of count rates) and corresponding spectra (Fig. 3)\nshow that there is a soft excess beyond pure neutral absorption. While both colors initially harden during dipping, the 1.5\u20133 keV band is from some point on stronger\nreduced than the 0.5\u20131.5 keV band, causing a reincrease\nof the low energy softness. This effect can be explained\nif the absorber only partially covers the X-ray source\n(Hanke et al. 2008; Hanke et al. in prep.).\n\nOrbital phase\nrel. flux normalization\nNH [1022 cm\u22122] XMM\u2212PN rate [c/s]\n0.6\n0.8\n1 0 2 4 6\n20 30 40 50\n\n\u22120.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n18.6\n\n18.8\n\n19\n\nDay of 2008 April (MJD \u2212 54556)\n\nFig. 2.

The red curve is the\nlinear model from Fig. 1, scaled to match the flux normalization.\n\n4. Ionization State of the Wind\nWhile the high-resolution Chandra-HETGS spectra of\nnon-dip phases show absorption lines merely of the highest ionization stages (elements other than iron appear\nonly H- or He-like; Hanke et al. 2009), lower ionization\nstages are recognized in the dip spectra from resonance\nK\u03b1 absorption lines of Ar, Si, and Al. This result is\nconsistent with the model presented above: the largest\npart of the wind in front of the black hole is almost completely photoionized; only dense blobs produce enough\nself-shielding in order to contain lower ionization stages.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded by the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr\nWirtschaft und Technologie through the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt under contract 50OR0701.\nReferences\nFriend, D.B. & Castor, J.I. 1982 ApJ, 261, 293\nGies D.R. et al. 2003 ApJ, 583, 424\nHanke M. et al. 2008 PoS (Proceedings of the 7.
