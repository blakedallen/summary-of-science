Following this idea, vacuum can be regarded as a standard medium with its own\nelectromagnetic properties. Nevertheless, effects related\nto these properties are extremely weak and can only be\ntested in the presence of a very high electromagnetic field.\nFor that reason, pulsars are very appropriate systems to\nlook for evidences for vacuum properties [3, 4]. Pulsars\nare fast-rotating neutrons stars, with a very high magnetic dipole moment tilted with respect to their rotational axis. Typically, their mass is of the order of the\nsolar mass, and their radius of the order of 10 km. But\nthe most interesting feature of these stars is certainly\ntheir magnetic field which can exceed 108 T on their surface [5]. Pulsars are thus suitable laboratories to study\nmagnetic properties of the surrounding vacuum. In particular, a class of pulsars called magnetars [6] is characterized by a long spinning period and a magnetic field\non the surface which is supposed to be even greater than\nthe QED critical field 4 \u00d7 109 T [7, 8]. At such a field\nnon linear properties of quantum vacuum cannot be neglected. In general, the surface magnetic field of pulsars\nis inferred by comparing the measured period derivative\nwith the one obtained using the energy loss rate given by\nthe classical formula for a radiating rotating magnetic\ndipole. We believe that inferring a field exceeding the\nQED critical one using a pure classical formula (which\nneglects any QED effect) is questionable. Heyl et al.\n[9, 10] have shown that the energy loss rate of a radiating rotating magnetic dipole, calculated by taking into\naccount QED differs very little by the classical one. The\n\nuse of a QED formula for the radiating dipole does not\nchange in practise the inferred magnetic field on the surface of the pulsar.\nVery recently, we have shown that a new energy loss\nprocess for pulsars should be taken into account, namely\nQuantum Vacuum Friction (QVF) resulting from the\ninteraction between the non-stationary magnetic dipole\nmoment of the star and its induced quantum vacuum\nmagnetic dipole moment [11]. In the case of magnetars,\nwith very high magnetic fields, we have shown that the\nQVF is the dominating energy loss process and has important consequences. In particular, the inferred value of\nthe magnetic field no long exceeds the QED critical field\nfor all known magnetars.\nIn this letter we consider some astrophysical consequences of QVF. We show that QVF plays a crucial role\nin neutron star evolution. Taking into account this effect, we show that magnetars can simply be understood\nas a natural evolution state of typical pulsars, similar to\nthe Crab pulsar. For the Crab pulsar, of which the characteristic age is known, we present the first completely\ncoherent time evolution for its period and braking index.\nLet us first summarize the main results concerning QVF\nin highly magnetized neutron stars. Considering a neutron star rotating in vacuum, we denote by R its radius\nand B0 the magnitude of the magnetic field at its surface.\nIf P is the spinning period of the neutron star and \u03b8 the\ninclination angle of its magnetic dipole moment with respect to the rotation axis of the star, one can show that\nfor B0 \u2264 1010 T, the QVF energy loss rate \u0116qv is given\n\n\f2\n\n\u0116qv \u2243 \u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\n18\u03c0\n45\n\n\u0013\n2\n\nsin2 \u03b8 B04 R4\nBc2 \u03bc0 c P 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Bc = m2e c3 /e~ \u2243 4.4 109 T is the QED critical\nfield, \u03b1 the fine structure constant, \u03bc0 the vacuum permeability and c the light velocity in vacuo. Total energy\nloss rate of the star \u0116 can thus be obtained by adding\nthe classical dipolar radiative energy loss rate \u0116r given\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\n128\u03c0 5 sin2 \u03b8 B02 R6\n\u0116r =\n(2)\n3\n\u03bc0 c 3 P 4\nIt is important to stress that the spinning period dependence is not the same for the classical radiative process\nand for the QVF. The ratio of classical to QVF losses\ndecreases like 1/P 2 for large P , so that QVF becomes\nmore important for slowly rotating neutron stars. Let\nus now study how QVF drastically changes the evolution\nof a pulsar. The evolution of a pulsar in period P and\nslowdown \u1e56 is usually described in a logarithmic P \u2212 \u1e56 diagram as shown in fig. 1, where we have plotted all of\nthe currently known pulsars (\u223c 1700) for which P and\n\u1e56 have been measured [12]. On this diagram, we have\nalso indicated lines of constant magnetic field in the case\nwhere only the classical radiative energy loss process is\nconsidered (dotted lines) together with the case for which\nQVF is taken into account (solid curves). These lines are\nobtained by matching the loss in rotational energy \u0116 with\n\u0116r + \u0116qv . Since \u0116 is given by\n\u0116 = 4\u03c0 2 I \u1e56 P \u22123\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a neutron star moment of inertia of I = 1045 g.cm2\nis assumed, we get\n\u0013\n\u0013 4 4\n\u0012\n\u0012\nB0 R P\n3\n32\u03c0 3 B02 R6\n+\u03b1\n(4)\n\u1e56 =\n3I\n\u03bc0 c 3 P\n16I Bc2 \u03bc0 c\nwhere sin \u03b8 is taken, as usual, equal to 1. The first term\nin eq. (4) corresponds to the classical contribution, which\ngives the asymptotic behaviour for small P . The second\nterm is the correction due to QVF, which becomes important for large P . In fig. 1 we clearly distinguish two\ndifferent evolution areas : pulsars located in the upper\nright area of the figure (gray) have an energy loss process dominated by QVF, whereas pulsars in the lower left\narea have classical magnetic dipole emission as the main\nenergy loss. Defining the borderline between both areas\nas\nd log \u1e56\n=0\nd log P\n\n(5)\n\nP\u0308 P\n=0\n\u1e56 3\n\n(6)\n\nwe get\n\nSince P 6= 0, this equation implies that P\u0308 = 0 and thus,\nthe borderline between both areas corresponds to pulsars having a constant slowdown \u1e56 .

Pulsars located in the upper right area (gray) have an energy loss\nprocess dominated by QVF. The Crab pulsar is marked as a\ncircle filled with a dot.\n\npulsar's magnetic field to remain constant during its evolution, we can describe the evolution of the star following the line on which it is situated today. Let us first\nignore QVF. Since the rotational period of a pulsar increases with time, the natural evolution of these stars\ncorresponds to a fall towards the lower right area of the\nfigure along a given straight dotted line, depending of\nthe value of their magnetic field. In this case, pulsars\nlocated in the upper right area can exhibit surface magnetic fields above the quantum critical field. Since these\nstars cannot be connected by a straight line of constant\nmagnetic field to other pulsars1 with lower rotational period, we have to assume that these stars are very young,\neven if their rotational period is already high. For that\nreason, this class of pulsars, called magnetars, seems to\nbe very different in nature from other standard pulsars.\nTo understand the structure of these stars and the physical process involved which should give rise to such a huge\nsurface magnetic field remains an open question. If we\ntake into account QVF, we see that all magnetars are\nnow connected by a modified line of constant magnetic\nfield to pulsars with lower rotational period. Remarkably\nenough, their surface magnetic field becomes lower than\nthe critical quantum field. We can then conclude, as far\nas QVF exists, that magnetars could be understood as a\nnatural evolution of standard pulsars. Such a very important astrophysical consequence of quantum vacuum effect\nshows that testing the validity of the QVF theory would\nbe crucial in the future to understand pulsars physics.\nIt is also important to stress that with magnetic fields\nbelow the critical quantum field, the current explanation\nfor the emmission properties of Anomalous X-ray Pul-\n\n\f3\n\nKr\n+ Kqv P\nP\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\nt = \u2212955 yr\n\n0.05\n\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nt(yr)\n\nFIG. 2: Spin period of the Crab pulsar as a function of time\nwhen QVF is taken into account (full line) and when QVF is\nneglected (dotted line). t = 0 corresponds to current time (i.e\n\"today\").\n\n(7)\n2\n\n2\n\nwhere Kr = \u0116r \u00d7(P /4\u03c0 I) and Kqv = \u0116qv \u00d7(P /4\u03c0 I),\nthe age of a pulsar \u03c4 is given by\nZ P\nZ t\ndP \u2032\n\u2032\ndt =\n\u03c4=\n(8)\nKr\n\u2032\nPi P \u2032 + kqv P\nt0\nwhere t denotes the current date and Pi the initial spin\nperiod at t = t0 .

Nevertheless, the most important difference\nbetween both calculations is that the one taking into account QVF is the only one which provides a spin period\nevolution completely coherent with current observations,\nin particular with the current value of the braking index,\nas we will discuss in the following.\n3\n\n1\n\n2.8\n\nn\n\n\u1e56 =\n\n0.06\n\nP (s)\n\nsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) can\nnot be applied to our model [13], and so, this emmission\nremains an open question. Another interesting result of\ntaking QVF into account in magnetized rotating neutron\nstars is a completely coherent time evolution of pulsars,\nas we will show in the following. Let us illustrate this\npoint in detail with the Crab pulsar (the one marked as\na circle filled with a dot in fig.1). Situated in the center\nof the Crab Nebula which is the remnant of the Super\nNovae SN1054, the Crab pulsar is certainly one of the\nmost well-known pulsars [14]. A very interesting feature\nof this pulsar is that historical records indicate its characteristic age to be \u223c 955 yr. This indication, together\nwith accurate measurements of its current spin period\nP , first and second time derivative of the spin period, respectively P1 and P2 , drastically constrains its rotational\nevolution dynamics. Rewriting eq. (4) as\n\n2.6\n\n2.51\n\nIf Kqv \u226a Kr eq. (9) becomes\n\n\u2022\n\n2.4\n\n\u03c4\u2243\n\n1\n(P 2 \u2212 Pi 2 )\n2Kr\n\n(10)\n\nFrom eq.

Inverting eq. (9) (resp.\neq. (11)) we obtain the spin period as a function of time\nwhen classical and QVF energy loss processes are taken\ninto account (resp. when QVF is neglected). Both cases\nare presented in fig. 2 for the Crab pulsar. In this figure,\nt = 0 corresponds to current time (i.e \"today\"). Since the\nage of this pulsar is known, we can estimate the initial\nspin period Pi .\nUsing the classical expression we obtain Pi = 16 ms,\nwhereas we get Pi = 18 ms when QVF is taken into account. Since the energy loss process of the Crab pulsar is dominated by classical radiation (see fig. 1), we\nare not surprised that the global time evolution of this\nstar does not drastically change when QVF effects are\n\n2.2\n\n2\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nt(yr)\n\nFIG. 3: Braking index of the Crab pulsar as a function of time\nwhen QVF is taken into account (full line) and when QVF is\nneglected (dotted line). t = 0 corresponds to current time.\n\nThe braking index, n, is a fundamental dimensionless\nquantity given by [15]\n\u03bd \u03bd\u0308\n(12)\n\u03bd\u0307 2\nwhere \u03bd is the spin frequency of the pulsar and \u03bd\u0307 (resp.\n\u03bd\u0308), denotes the first (resp. the second) derivative of \u03bd\nwith respect to time. This parameter describes the rate\nat which a pulsar loses rotational energy. Introducing the\nspin period P = 1/\u03bd, we rewrite the braking index as\nn=\n\nn = 2 1\u2212\n\nP P\u0308\n\u1e56 2\n\n(13)\n\n\f4\nFrom this expression we see that the borderline between\ngray and white plotted in fig. 1 corresponds to pulsars\nhaving a braking index equal to 2 (P\u0308 = 0). Pulsars\nlocated in the upper right area of the figure (gray) have\na braking index lower than 2, whereas braking index of\npulsars in the lower left area is higher. In the following\nwe study the time evolution of n for t > 0. We denote\nby P0 the current spin period, and by P1 and P2 , the\ncurrent values of the first and the second derivative of P\nwith respect to time. The current value of n is\nn0 = 2 \u2212\n\nP0 P2\nP12\n\n(14)\n\nAt this stage it is important to stress that the constant\nvalue n = 3 is expected for pure classical radiation models, whereas the current measured value is n0 = 2.51 for\nthe Crab pulsar. This discrepancy shows that pure classical radiation models would not lead to a realistic picture\nfor this pulsar's time evolution. Adding QVF effects, solution of eq. (7) becomes, for t \u2265 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nKr\nKr\np2 (t) =\n+ P02 e2Kqv t \u2212\n(15)\nKqv\nKqv\nThis expression allows us to calculate the first and the\nsecond derivative of P with respect to time, and to match\n\u1e56 (0) with P1 and P\u0308 (0) with P2 , obtaining\nP0 P2 + P12\n2P0 P1\n\n(16)\n\nP0 P12 \u2212 P2 P02\n2P1\n\n(17)\n\nKqv =\nand\nKr =\n\nFinally, the time evolution of the spin period is given by\nr\n2P0 P1 At\nP (t) =\n(e \u2212 1) + P02\n(18)\nA\nwith\nA=\n\n\u0012\n\nP1\nP2\n+\nP1\nP0\n\n\u0013\n\nUsing eq. (18), we can calculate the braking index\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP0 P2\nn(t) = 1 \u2212\n\u2212\n1\ne\u2212At\nP12\n= 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 n0 )e\u2212At\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nThe braking index time evolution for the Crab pulsar is\npresented in fig. (3). When QVF is taken into account,\nthe braking index is a decreasing function with respect to\ntime which is consistent with a global rotation slowdown.\nFrom eq. (20) we can predict the current value of the first\nderivative of n given by\n\u1e45(0) = A(1 \u2212 n0 )\n\n(21)\n\nAs far as we know, there are only two pulsars in the\nATNF catalogue [12] for which the calculated value of\n\u1e45c (0) can be compared with our estimation given by\neq. (21). These stars are the Crab pulsar and the\nB1509-58 pulsar. For the Crab pulsar we get \u1e45(0) \u223c\n\u22121.8421 10\u221211 s\u22121 and \u1e45c (0) \u223c 1.5676 10\u221213 s\u22121 , whereas\nfor the B1509-58 pulsar we get \u1e45(0) \u223c \u22121.3550 10\u221211 s\u22121 ,\na value in perfect agreement with the calculated one\n\u1e45c (0) \u223c \u22121.2500 10\u221211 s\u22121 . These results show that new\nmeasurements of \u1e45(0) are needed to improve statistics\nand thus provide a very important test to confirm our\nQVF predictions.\nIn this letter we have shown that QVF should play\nan important role in neutron star evolution. Taking into\naccount this effect, we have shown that the surface magnetic field of magnetars becomes lower than the critical\nquantum field, so that magnetars could be simply understood as a natural evolution of standard pulsars. For\npulsars for which the braking index is known, QVF provides a completely coherent spindown history, as illustrated with the Crab pulsar. For this pulsar we have also\ngiven the predicted value of the current first derivative\nof the braking index, suggesting a very important test to\nconfirm QVF.\n\n[1] H. Euler and B.
