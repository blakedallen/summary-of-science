The latter are commonly explained in terms of the\ndynamics of superfluid vortices within the inner crust of neutron stars (see [1]\nand Refs. therein). By \"inner crust\" one usually indicates the part of the shell\n< \u03c1 < 0.5\u03c1 , where \u03c1 is\nof a neutron star with sub-nuclear densities 0.001\u03c10 \u223c\n\u223c\n0\n0\nthe normal nuclear density. According to present-day ideas, the bulk of the\n1\n\n\finner crust consists mainly of spherically symmetrical nuclear-like clusters\nwhich form a crystal matrix immersed in a sea of neutrons and virtually\nuniform sea of electrons. Such a picture was first justified microscopically in\nthe classical paper by Negele and Vautherin [2] within the Wigner-Seitz (WS)\napproximation. This approximation consists in replacing the crystal by a sum\nof identical spherical cells with a nuclear cluster at the cell center. As far\nas the WS method is inconsistent with the crystal symmetry (periodicity),\nit implies a need for some artificial boundary conditions for the neutron\nwave functions at the WS cell boundary. To some extent, these conditions\nare arbitrary provided they guarantee the orthogonality and completeness of\nthe single-particle basis. Unfortunately, calculations with complete taking\ninto account the crystal symmetry are quite complicated. There are only\nfew such calculations, being limited mainly with consideration of the deep\n(high density) layers of the crust[3, 4], where the \"lasagna\" or \"spaguetti\"\nstructure of the crust matter is assumed and the use of the WS method with\nthe spherical symmetry cannot be applied. Only recently a consistent band\ntheory was developed for the outer (low density) layers as well [5]. Therefore\nup to now the WS method is quite popular and it is usually considered as the\nmost practical one for systematic investigation of the inner crust structure\nin the whole density interval. For describing the matter of a neutron star\ncrust, Negele and Vautherin used a version of the energy functional method\nwith the density dependent effective mass m\u2217 (\u03c1). In fact, it is very close to\nthe Hartree-Fock method with effective Skyrme forces. For a fixed average\nnuclear density \u03c1, the nuclear (plus electron) energy functional is minimized\nfor the spherical WS cell of the radius Rc . A cell contains Z protons (and\nelectrons) and N=A\u2212Z neutrons (A = (4\u03c0/3)Rc3 \u03c1). In addition, the \u03b2stability condition,\n\u03bcn \u2212 (\u03bcp + \u03bce ) = 0,\n(1)\nhas to be fulfilled, where \u03bcn , \u03bcp and \u03bce are the chemical potentials of neutrons,\nprotons and electrons, respectively. The minimization procedure is carried\nout for different values of Z and Rc . The equilibrium configuration (Z, Rc ) at\nthe considered density corresponds to the absolute minimum in energy among\nall these possible configurations. Application of the variational principle to\nthe energy functional by Negele and Vautherin for a WS cell results in a\nset of the Shr\u00f6dinger-type equations for the single particle neutron functions\n\u03c6\u03bb (r) = Rnlj (r)\u03a6ljm (n), with the standard notation. The radial functions\nRnlj (r) obey the boundary condition at the point r = Rc . As it was noted\n2\n\n\fabove, different kinds of boundary conditions could be used. Negele and\nVautherin used the following one:\nRnlj (r = Rc ) = 0\n\n(2)\n\nfor odd l, and\ndRnlj\ndr\n\n!\n\n= 0,\n\n(3)\n\nr=Rc\n\nfor even ones. Let us denote it as BC1. The use of this version of the\nboundary conditions has been partly justified by physical considerations in\n[2], but the dependence of the results on the particular choice has never been\ndiscussed in detail. It is the purpose of the paper to study this problem at\na quantitative level and to establish the corresponding uncertainty, which is\ninherent to the WS method applied to neutron star crust. For this aim, we\ncompare results obtained for the BC1 with those found for an alternative kind\nof the boundary conditions (BC2) when Eq. (2) is valid for even l whereas\nEq. (3), for odd ones. In principle, two additional kinds of the boundary\nconditions exist when Eq. (2) or Eq. (3) is used for any l. As it was noted\nin [2], these versions have an obvious drawback for the case of the neutron\nstar inner crust since they lead to an unphysical irregular behavior of the\nneutron density \u03c1n (r) in vicinity of the point r = Rc . Indeed, \u03c1n (r) vanishes\nin this point in the first case and has a maximum in the second one. On\nthe contrary, \u03c1n (r) is almost constant nearby the point r = Rc in the case of\nthe BC1 or BC2 kinds of the boundary conditions. It should be noted that\nthe pairing effects were not taken into account in [2] since it was supposed\nthat they are not important for the structure of the crust. The reason of\nsuch an assumption is the rather small contribution of the pairing effects\nto the total binding energy of the system under consideration. Recently,\nwe have generalized the approach by Negele and Vautherin to describe the\ninner crust by explicitly including the neutron and proton pairing correlations\n[6, 7, 8, 9] in a self-consistent way. It turned out that in the whole interval of\n\u03c1 the equilibrium configuration (Z, Rc ) changes significantly due to pairing.\nTo explain this effect, it is instructive to analyze the \u03b2-stability condition\n(1). Since electrons in the inner crust of a neutron star are ultra-relativistic,\nthe following relation is valid: \u03bce \u2243 (9\u03c0Z/4)1/3 /Rc . By substituting it into\nEq. (1), one finds\nZ\u2243\n\n4\n(\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp )3 Rc3 .\n9\u03c0\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe influence of pairing on the chemical potentials \u03bcn and \u03bcp is much\nstronger than that on the total binding energy. Their variation may be of\nthe order of the gap value \u2206 \u22431\u20132 MeV. Such a variation of \u03bcn or \u03bcp may\nlead to a sizable change of the equilibrium value of Z because the difference\n(\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp ) is raised to the third power in Eq. (4). The estimate of the change\nof Z induced by this variation is as follows: \u03b4Z=3Z\u03b4(\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp )/(\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp ). For\naverage values of kF , the difference \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp \u2243 50 \u00f7 70 MeV, hence \u03b4Z could\nreach few units of Z. An additional change of the Z value may appear due\nto a variation of Rc . Besides, as it is shown in [8, 9], the binding energy EB\nis rather flat function of Z and different local minima EB (Z) have often close\nvalues of EB . Therefore their relative position may change after switching\noff the pairing since in general the corresponding contribution to EB is an\nirregular function of Z. Such a situation does often occur within the WS\napproach, especially for high density values, due to the shell-type effects in\nthe single-particle neutron spectrum. An example is discussed in the paper.\n\n2\n\nBrief description of the method\n\nWe used the generalized energy functional method [10] which incorporates the\npairing effects into the original Kohn-Sham [11] method. In this approach,\nthe interaction part of the generalized energy functional depends, on equal\nfooting, on the normal densities \u03c1n , \u03c1p , and the abnormal ones, \u03bdn , \u03bdp , as well:\nEint =\n\nZ\n\ndrEint (\u03c1(r), \u03bd(r)),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Eint is the energy functional density. It is the sum of two components,\nthe normal and the anomalous (superfluid) ones:\nEint = Enorm (\u03c1\u03c4 ) + Ean (\u03c1\u03c4 , \u03bd\u03c4 ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = n, p is the isotopic index. Just as in the Kohn-Sham method,\nthe prescription m\u2217 = m holds to be true. To describe the central part\nof a WS cell with the nuclear cluster inside we used the phenomenological\nnuclear energy functional E ph by Fayans et al. [10] which describes properties\nof the terrestrial atomic nuclei with high accuracy. For describing neutron\nmatter surrounding the cluster we used a microscopic energy functional E mi\nfor neutron matter based on the Argonne NN potential v18 [12]. The ansatz\n4\n\n\fof [8, 9] for the complete energy functional is a smooth matching of the\nphenomenological and the microscopic functionals at the cluster surface:\nE(\u03c1\u03c4 (r), \u03bd\u03c4 (r)) = E ph (\u03c1\u03c4 (r), \u03bd\u03c4 (r))Fm (r) + E mi (\u03c1\u03c4 (r), \u03bd\u03c4 (r))(1 \u2212 Fm (r)), (7)\nwhere the matching function Fm (r) is a two-parameter Fermi function:\nFm (r) = (1 + exp((r \u2212 Rm )/dm ))\u22121 .\n\n(8)\n\nEq. (7) is applied both to the normal and to the anomalous components of\nthe energy functional. After a detailed analysis, the matching parameters\nwere chosen as follows. The diffuseness parameter was taken to be equal to\ndm =0.3 fm for any value of the average baryon density of the inner crust and\nfor any configuration (Z, Rc ). As to the matching radius Rm , it should be\nchosen anew in any new case, in such a way that the equality\n\u03c1p (Rm ) = 0.1\u03c1p (0)\n\n(9)\n\nholds. In this case, on one hand, for r < Rm neutrons and protons coexist\ninside the nuclear-type cluster, and the use of a realistic phenomenological\nenergy functional seems reasonable. On the other hand, at r > Rm one can\nneglect the exponentially decaying proton \"tails\" and consider the system\nas a pure neutron matter for which an adequate energy functional microscopically calculated can be used. The same matching parameters were used\nfor normal and anomalous parts of (7). As far as practically all the protons\nare located inside the radius Rm , the matching procedure concerns, in fact,\nonly neutrons, protons being described with the pure phenomenological nuclear functional. It is worth to mention that for neutron matter region, the\nansatz is, in fact, the LDA for the microscopic part of the generalized energy\nfunctional. As it is commonly known, the LDA works well only provided\nthe density is smoothly varying, whereas it fails in the surface region with a\nsharp density gradient. The above choice of the matching procedure and the\nvalues of the parameters guarantees that this region of a sharp density variation is mainly governed by the phenomenological nuclear part of the energy\nfunctional which \"knows how to deal with it\". For the microscopic part of\nthe normal component of the total energy functional (7) we follow to refs.\n[8, 9] and take the equation of states of neutron matter calculated in [13]\nwith the Argonne v18 potential on the basis of Brueckner theory, taking into\n5\n\n\faccount a small admixture of 3-body force. Its explicit form could be found\nin the cited articles. The microscopic part of the anomalous component of\nthe generalized energy functional in [8, 9] was calculated for the same v18\npotential within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) approximation.\n\n3\n\nComparison of two kinds of boundary conditions, the BC1 versus BC2.\n\nIn the calculations of [6, 7, 8, 9] the boundary condition by Negele and\nVautherin, BC1, was used. Here we repeat the analysis for the case of the\nboundary condition BC2. Results for the binding energy per a nucleon, EB ,\nare shown in Fig. 1.\nIt is worth to mention that calculations for larger values of kF should be\nconsidered as optional as far in this case the spaguetti phase, evidently, is\nrealized. This is true for kF =1.2 fm\u22121 [14, 3] and, maybe, for kF =1.1 fm\u22121\n[3]. Just as in [8, 9] only even values of Z are used. The detailed comparison\nis made for kF =0.8 fm\u22121 . Although the two curves EB (Z) are quite different,\nthe positions of local minima for BC1 and BC2 are close to each other, the\ndistance being equal to 2 or 4 units of Z. What is of primary importance, the\nrelative position of local minima for BC2 is the same as for BC1. In particular, the positions of the absolute minimum almost coincide (Z=52 for BC1\nand Z=54 for BC2). These observations permit us to simplify calculations\nfor other values of kF . In the case of BC2, we limit ourselves mainly with the\nanalysis of a vicinity of the absolute minimum for BC1. The neighborhood\nof other local minima was analyzed only in the case if they have values of\nEB (Z) close to that corresponding to the absolute minimum. It turned out\nthat there is no value of kF for which the relative position of a local minimum and of the absolute one for BC1 and BC2 is different. In addition to\nsystematic calculations for kF =0.6 \u00f7 1.2 fm\u22121 , we made an extra one for a\nsmall density, kF =0.2 fm\u22121 , in vicinity of the neutron drip point. In the last\ncase, two curves corresponding to BC1 and BC2 practically coincide. For all\nother values of kF the absolute minima are shifted by 2, 4 or even 6 units of\nZ. Comparison of different properties of the equilibrium configuration of the\nWS cell for various values of kF in the case of BC1 and BC2 is presented in\nTable 1.\nThere are two lines for every value of kF .

The only exception is kF =0.2 fm\u22121 when these two\nvalues of Z coincide.

For a comparison, the infinite matter value \u2206inf is given in the Table.\nIt is calculated within the BCS approximation for the density of neutron\nmatter corresponding to kF value under consideration. So drastic difference\nbetween \u2206inf and \u2206F values in the case of kF =0.2 fm\u22121 is caused by the trivial\nreason that this kF is in the vicinity of the neutron drip point. Therefore\nthe asymptotic neutron density which determines mainly the \u2206F value is\nTable 1: Comparison of properties of equilibrium configurations of the WS\ncell for two different kinds of the boundary condition\n\nkF ,\n\nZ\n\nfm\u22121\n0.2 52\n58\n0.6\n56\n52\n0.7\n48\n42\n0.8\n44\n24\n0.9\n22\n20\n1.0\n24\n1.1 20\n26\n20\n1.2\n26\n\nRc , fm\nBC1\n57.18\n37.51\n36.97\n32.02\n31.16\n26.90\n27.29\n20.26\n19.87\n16.69\n18.29\n14.99\n16.75\n13.68\n15.21\n\nEB , MeV\n\n\u03bcn , MeV\n\n\u2206F , MeV\n\nBC2\nBC1\nBC2\nBC1\nBC2 BC1\n57.10 -0.9501 -0.9483 0.1928 0.1942 0.04\n37.48 2.1516 2.1596 3.2074 3.2226 1.92\n36.95 2.1563 2.1572 3.2173 3.2193 1.91\n32.04 2.7908 2.7989 3.9876 4.0107 2.30\n31.14 2.7924 2.7856 4.0069 3.9873 2.29\n26.91 3.4373 3.4471 4.8454 4.8561 2.56\n27.30 3.4435 3.4319 4.8553 4.8198 2.53\n20.30 4.1123 4.1169 5.7340 5.7986 2.64\n19.70 4.1141 4.1104 5.7861 5.7170 2.62\n16.90 4.8210 4.8522 6.8525 6.7424 2.02\n18.22 4.8479 4.8231 6.8446 6.8920 2.52\n15.33 5.5765 5.6733 7.4288 8.0446 1.32\n17.08 5.6677 5.6100 7.9680 8.5398 2.28\n13.95 6.4225 6.6762 8.5814 9.1898 1.21\n14.89 6.6639 6.4587 9.0825 9.3413 1.25\n\n8\n\nBC2\n0.05\n1.89\n1.89\n2.25\n2.32\n2.45\n2.56\n2.51\n2.54\n2.52\n2.29\n2.32\n2.02\n1.56\n0.86\n\n\u2206inf ,\nMeV\n0.40\n2.42\n2.76\n2.93\n2.92\n2.68\n2.26\n1.66\n\n\fsignificantly less than that for the uniform matter distribution. One can\nsee that the influence of the boundary conditions is enhanced at increasing\nvalues of kF . Especially strong variation of \u2206F and \u03bcn values takes place in\nthe cases of kF =1.1 fm\u22121 and kF=1.2 fm\u22121 , see Fig. 2.\nTo illustrate the influence of the boundary conditions on the neutron gap\nin the first case, the gap function \u2206n (r) is drawn for both values of Z and\nboth kinds of the boundary conditions. The strongest variation of the gap\noccurs in the case of Z=20. To understand the reason of such strong effect,\nwe draw the neutron single particle spectrum \u03b5\u03bb for this value of Z in Fig.\n3 for the BC1 case (the left half of the figure) and the BC2 one (the right\none). The position of the chemical potential \u03bcn is shown with dots.\nThe two spectra are absolutely different. The reason is the shift \u2206\u03b5\u03bb of\neach \u03bb-level going from BC1 to BC2. The value of this shift is approximately\n\n\u2206 n, MeV\n\n2.5\n\nkF=1.1 fm\n\n-1\n\n2.0\n\nZ=20\n1.5\n\nZ=26\n\n1.0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nr, fm\nFigure 2: The neutron gap for kF =1.1 fm\u22121 , Z=20 and Z=26, in the BC1\ncase (solid lines) and the BC2 one (dashed lines).\n\n9\n\n\f13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n\n1n23/2\n\n\u03b5\u03bb, MeV\n\n8\n7\n2j13/2\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nFigure 3: The neutron single-particle spectrum \u03b5\u03bb for kF=1.1 fm\u22121 , Z=20,\nin the BC1 case (left) and the BC2 one (right).\nequal to a half of the distance between two neighboring levels with the same\n(l, j), the sign of the shift being opposite for even and odd l. The absolute\nvalue of the shift is proportional to 1/Rc2 and grows at increasing values of\nkF . The corresponding shifts are shown in Fig. 3 for two states, 2j13/2 and\n1n23/2 , which are the neighbors of \u03bcn in the BC1 case. On average, the\nspectrum is quite dense, however in both cases there is a shell type structure\nwith rather wide intervals between some neighboring levels. If one deals with\na big inter-level space in vicinity of \u03bcn , as in the BC1 case in Fig. 3, one\n10\n\n\fusually obtains a dense set of levels in this region when going to the opposite\nkind of the boundary conditions. In the BC2 case, big intervals are far from\nthe Fermi surface and do not influence significantly the value of the neutron\ngap. On the contrary, in the BC1 case \u03bcn is situated just inside such an\ninterval that suppresses the gap significantly. In principle, the neutron gap\ncould vanish if the interval was wider.\n\n\u2206 n, MeV\n\n2.5\n\n42\n\n44\n2.0\n\nkF=0.8 fm\n\n-1\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nr, fm\nFigure 4: The neutron gap for kF =0.8 fm\u22121 , Z=42 and Z=44, in the BC1\ncase (solid lines) and the BC2 one (dashed lines).\nAs to the gap function itself, for intermediate densities, kF < 1 fm\u22121 ,\nvariations caused by the choice of the boundary conditions are not significant.\nAn example for the case of kF =0.8 fm\u22121 is given in Fig. 4 where, just as in\nFig. 2, four curves for \u2206(r) are shown. The difference between any couple of\nthese curves is less, of course, than the accuracy of the approach. Evidently,\nthe most important uncertainty in the neutron gap value comes from using\nthe BCS approximation without many-body effects like screening, which, for\n11\n\n\finfinite neutron matter, overestimates \u2206n significantly [7].\nTo be definite, let us consider the \"self-consistent\" (Z=42 for kF =0.8 fm\u22121 )\ngap function for the BC1 version of the boundary conditions as the prediction\nof the WS method for \u2206(r) in the case of small and intermediate densities,\nkF < 1.0 fm\u22121 . Such a choice corresponds to that used in [9]. The \"normal\" situation with the gap in the case of intermediate densities corresponds\nto much more regular single-particle neutron spectra, than that in Fig. 3.\nFor the case of kF =0.8 fm\u22121 it is illustrated in Fig. 5. One can see that,\nalthough here also there are some irregularities in the inter-level distances,\nthey are much smaller than the gap value \u2206 \u2243 2.5 MeV. Therefore they\ndon't influence the gap equation significantly.\nIn the case of bigger densities, as it is seen in Fig. 2, there is a significant uncertainty in predictions for \u2206(r) within the WS method. As it was\ndiscussed above, it originates from the shell-type structure of the neutron\nsingle-particle spectrum which appears in the case of high kF (small Rc ) values. We consider this effect as an artifact of the WS approximation which\nmust disappear (or almost disappear) in a more advanced approach with the\nconsistent consideration of the band structure. No doubts, if a forbidden\nspace between two bands in vicinity of \u03bcn in the band structure calculation\nwill appear, it should be much less than the gap \u2206 value. Therefore the\nsolution of the gap equation in the realistic case should be closer to that in\nthe WS approximation for such a situation when there is no big inter-level\ninterval close to \u03bcn . Returning to Fig. 2, these are the dotted line for Z=20\nand the solid one, for Z=26. Again the difference between these two curves is\nnot essential, and any of them could be used as the prediction for \u2206(r) in the\ncase of kF =1.1 fm\u22121 . Strictly speaking, such a recipe is not a self-consistent\none within the WS method, but it looks reasonable from the physical point\nof view.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and conclusions.\n\nAs we have seen, there are internal uncertainties inherent to the WS method\napplied to the neutron star inner crust which originate from the kind of the\nboundary condition used. In the case of very small density nearby the neutron drip point the predictions of the BC1 and BC2 versions are practically\nidentical. At increasing density, with kF \u2265 0.6 fm\u22121 , the uncertainty in the\nequilibrium value of Z is between 2 and 6 units, with the largest values at\n12\n\n\f6.5\n\n6.0\n\n5.5\n\n\u03b5\u03bb, MeV\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n2n21/2\n\n4i11/2\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\nFigure 5: The neutron single-particle spectrum \u03b5\u03bb for kF=0.8 fm\u22121 , Z=42,\nin the BC1 case (left) and the BC2 one (right).\n\n13\n\n\fthe largest kF . The uncertainty in the value of Rc is, as a rule, about 1 fm\nand only for kF =1.1 fm\u22121 it turns out to be about 2 fm. However, the value\nof these uncertainties is smaller than the variations of the equilibrium configuration (Z, Rc ) connected with the pairing effects [9]. For the case of small\nand intermediate densities , kF < 1 fm\u22121 , the uncertainty in predictions\nfor the gap function \u2206(r) caused by a particular choice of the boundary\n> 1 fm\u22121 ,\ncondition is also rather small. In the case of high densities, kF \u223c\nthe most important uncertainty occurs in the value of the neutron gap \u2206n .\nIn the WS approximation, it originates from the shell effect in the neutron\nsingle-particle spectrum which is rather pronounced in the case of big kF and,\ncorrespondingly, smaller Rc values. We consider this effect as an artifact of\nthe WS method which should disappear in a more consistent band structure\ncalculation. We suggest an approximate recipe to avoid this uncertainty for\nthe gap function \u2206(r). We think that the most important uncertainty in\nthe neutron gap value comes from the BCS approximation used. As it is\nwell known, in neutron matter the many-body corrections to the BCS approximation reduce the value of \u2206n significantly [7]. In the next paper, we\nplan to take into account this reduction effect for more realistic description\nof neutron superfluidity in the inner crust of neutron stars.\nThe authors thank N.E.
