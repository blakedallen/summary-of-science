High-Tc superconducting cuprates (HTSC) consist of two major classes - ptype which stands for hole-doped (La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 - LSCO, etc.) and n-type which\nstands for electron-doped cuprates (Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 - NCCO, P r2\u2212x Cex CuO4 - PCCO,\netc.). Despite similar crystal structure and presence of common to all HTSC base\nelement - CuO2 -plane, experimentally observed properties of these two classes are quite\ndifferent. Most clear of these differences are: i) the phase diagram [1, 2] is asymmetric\n- p-type systems characterized by the narrow range of concentrations x where the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase exist and by the wide \"dome\" of superconducting (SC)\nphase, while in the n-type systems the AFM phase extends until x = 0.14 and SC phase\nexist only on narrow range of concentrations; ii) distance \u2206EV H between the Fermi level\nand the Van-Hove singularity corresponding to plateau in dispersion around (\u03c0, 0) point\nin p-type cuprates is quite small - less then 0.03 eV, while in NCCO \u2206EV H \u2248 0.25\u00f70.35\neV [3, 4]; iii) Fermi surface evolution is quite different in these types [5, 4]; iv) until the\ntemperature T < 100 K the resistivity in normal state of NCCO is described by a Fermi\nliquid square-law dependence on temperature T [6] in contrast to the linear dependence\nin p-type HTSC [7]; v) the insulating gap in n-type systems is indirect [4] (the minimum\nof conduction band and maximum of a valence band are in different points of Brillouin\nZone), vi) in contrast to LSCO where pinning of the chemical potential takes place at\nsmall x, doping dependence of the chemical potential in NCCO is more complex [8].\nSince the recent experimental evidence as for p-type [9] as for n-type (phasesensitive experiments [10] and resistivity in magnetic field [11] in NCCO, penetration\ndepth measurements in PCCO [12, 13], and ARPES data [14]) convincingly shows that\nthe symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is of d-type (most probably,\ndx2 \u2212y2 -type) in the present work we will consider only dx2 \u2212y2 -pairing symmetry.\nIn the present work the properties of normal and superconducting phases of electron\nand hole doped cuprates are considered in the framework of the corresponding effective\nHamiltonians for p- and n-type systems in the approximation which includes spin\nfluctuations beyond Hubbard-I. It is shown that this theory gives quantitative agreement\nwith most of the experimental data on n-type compounds. In p-type systems the spinexciton mechanism of SC pairing is investigated.\n2. Adequate model for High-Tc cuprates is the multiband p-d model [15].\nInvestigations of non-superconducting phase of cuprates within this model in the\nframework of the Generalized Tight-Binding (GTB) method with account for strong\nelectron correlations gave quantitative agreement with ARPES data on undoped LSCO\n[16]. The chemical potential \u03bc(x) pinning in p-type [17] and absence of pinning in ntype [18] were described, and also the indirect insulating gap in NCCO was obtained\n[18] within GTB method. In order to investigate SC phase the low-energy effective\nHamiltonian for the multiband p-d model was obtained [19] with the help of operator\nform of perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonian is asymmetric for electron and hole\ndoping - for n-type system the usual t-J model take place while for p-type systems\nwith complicated band structure at the top of the valence band the adequate model\nis the effective singlet-triplet t-J model. In paper [20] was shown that the influence\n\n\f3\n\nProperties of normal and superconducting phases in the low-energy models . . .\n\nof three-center interaction terms in the effective model could be crucial for SC phase.\nFinally, for n-type cuprates the effective Hamiltonian with three-center interaction terms\nin Hubbard X-operators representation (Xfpq = |pi hq|) has the form:\nHt\u2212J\u2217 = Ht\u2212J + H3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nHt\u2212J =\n\nX\n\n(\u03b51 \u2212\n\n\u03bc)Xf\u03c3\u03c3\n\n+\n\nf,\u03c3\n\nH3 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c30 0\u03c3\nt00\nf g Xf Xg\n\n<f,g>,\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\n\nJf g\n\n<f,g>\n\n~f S\n~g \u2212 1 nf ng ,\nS\n4\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n0S \u0010\n\u0011\nt0S\nf m tmg\n\u03c3\u0304\u03c3 0\u03c3\u0304\n\u03c3\u0304\u03c3\u0304 0\u03c3\nXf\u03c30 Xm\nXg \u2212 Xf\u03c30 Xm\nXg .\nEct\n<f,g,m>,\u03c3\n\nX\n\n\u00112\n\n\u0010\n\nHere Jf g = 2 t0S\n/Ect is the exchange integral, Ect \u2248 2 eV is the energy of chargefg\nM\ntransfer gap that similar to U in the Hubbard model, tN\nare the hopping parameters\nfg\ncorresponding to annihilation of quasiparticle in state M on site f and creation in state\nN on site g.\nFor p-type cuprates the effective Hamiltonian - singlet-triplet t-J model - is more\ncomplicated [19] because of beside the presence of singlet subband described by (1) the\ntriplet subband and the singlet-triplet hybridization are included.\nAll parameters of the effective Hamiltonians strictly depends on microscopic\nparameters of the p-d model (see paper [21, 22] where the set of microscopic and\ncorresponding model parameters for n- and p-type cuprates are presented). Microscopic\nparameters for p-type (n-type) were obtained for undoped LSCO (NCCO) and in further\nstudy they are fixed and considered doping-independent. Since dependence of model\nparameters on distance is known from the explicit construction of Wannier states in the\nCuO2 unit cell, the following calculations are performed with inclusion of the hoppings\nand exchanges up to 5-th coordination sphere.\nEffective model (1) was investigated in the framework of equation of motion\nmethod in generalized Hartree-Fock\napproximation\n[23].EIn this procedure the following\nD\nE\nD\n\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 \u03c3\u0304\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03c3 \u03c3\u2032 \u03c3\u2032\nand Xf Xg .

In such decoupling the\nspin fluctuations are completely neglected, but the short-range magnetic order is the\nkey element to the proper description of the properties of normal and SC phases (see\ne.g. [24, 25]). Therefore, we will use decoupling which includes spin fluctuations beyond\nHubbard I approximation:\nD\nE\nD\nE\n\u03c31\n\u2032 \u2032\nXf\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 Xg\u03c3\u0304\u03c3 \u2192 Cf g .\nXf\u03c3\u03c3 Xg\u03c3 \u03c3 \u2192 n2p + \u2032 Cf g ,\n\u03c3 2\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\nHere Cf g = Xf\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 Xg\u03c3\u0304\u03c3 = 2 Sfz Sgz are the spin correlation functions.\nIn order to calculate spin correlation functions Cf g the two-dimensional t \u2212 J\nmodel of CuO2 -plane was used.

Chemical\npotential self-consistently calculated in the latter case denoted by solid horizontal line.\nAlso the dispersion of the t-J model in the AFM phase is shown (dash-dotted curve).\n\nHubbard operators were obtained with the help of Mori formalism that makes possible\nto present these functions as chain fraction. Elements of this fraction for electron and\nspin Green functions contain correlation functions for neighboring sites, while other\nelements of the fraction are higher-order Green functions. Latest approximated by\ndecoupling with vertex correction [26, 27]. Vertex correction determined from zero\nsite magnetization restriction in considered paramagnetic case. This condition, selfenergy equations on electron and spin Green functions and self-consistent conditions for\ncorrelation functions forms closed system that was iteratively solved for fixed chemical\npotential and temperature. Results of the calculations with small clusters [28, 29] are\nin good agreement with exact diagonalization and Quantum Monte Carlo studies. In\nthe present work spin correlation function were calculated in described approach from\nspin Green function on 20 \u00d7 20 lattice.\nIn paper [29] was shown that the quasiparticle decay \u0393k = \u2212Im\u03a3k (\u03c9 = 0) is large\naround (0, 0) and (\u03c0, \u03c0) points. Here \u03a3k (\u03c9) is the self-energy. In further study around\nthese points the artificial broadening of the spectral functions with \u0393k was made. The\nvalues of \u0393k were taken from paper [30]. It is worth to mention, that our calculations\nshows such introduction of quasiparticle decay have very small influence on such integral\ncharacteristics as chemical potential \u03bc(x) and SC phase transition temperature Tc (x).\n3. First, we will consider n-type cuprates and corresponding t-J* effective model\n(1). Since singlet-triplet t-J* model is the generalization of the t-J* model most\nconclusions regarded to t-J* model will remain the same for singlet-triplet t-J* model. In\nFig. 1 calculated dispersion curves and corresponding density of states in paramagnetic\nnon-superconducting phase in t-J and t-J* models with and without spin fluctuations\nare shown. Evidently, introduction of three-center interaction terms results in significant\n\n\fProperties of normal and superconducting phases in the low-energy models . . .\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

(b) - theoretically calculated\nTc (x) phase diagram (bold solid curve), and experimental results for TN (x) in NCCO\n(dashed line divides AFM phase on the left and paramagnetic phase on the right),\nTc (x) in NCCO (dotted curve with filled squares) and Tc (x) in PCCO (dash-dotted\ncurve with filled circles) are presented. Inset: calculated Tc (x) dependence for wider\nrange of concentrations.\n\nchanges on the top of the conductivity band; therefore, this will become significant at\nlow doping. In AFM phase in t-J model there is symmetry around (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and (\u03c0, 0)\npoints (see Fig. 1). In paramagnetic phase this symmetry absent. But the account for\nspin correlation functions Cf g gives tendency to restore symmetry around mentioned\npoints.\nIn Fig. 2a the \u03bc(x) dependence is shown. Our theoretical calculations are in very\ngood agreement with experimental data [8], presented in the same figure. In particular,\nthe \u03bc(x) pinning is absent. In the inset the experimental [31] (grayscale plot) and\ncalculated (black and white dashed lines) Fermi surfaces are shown for optimally doped\nNCCO (xopt = 0.15). ARPES experiment reveals only one Fermi surface cut and spectral\nfunction intensity is varying along this cut due to pseudogap effects. In our theory\nthere are two Fermi surface cuts. But due to strong momentum dependence of the\nquasiparticle decay rate the second cut falls into area of large \u0393k (this part shown in\nthe inset in Fig. 2a with white dashed lines). That is why this second cut must not be\nobserved in the ARPES experiment. In the light of aforesaid, we can say that there is\na good agreement of calculated and experimental Fermi surfaces.\n4. Since t-J* model in considered approximations give good agreements with\nexperimental data on non-superconducting phase, now we will proceed to the SC\nphase investigations. Obtained in present approach equations on superconducting order\nparameter \u2206k are completely analogous to presented in papers [20, 32], so we will not\n\n\fProperties of normal and superconducting phases in the low-energy models . . .\n\n6\n\nwrite them here. Just mention, that first, due to three-center interaction terms the SC\ncoupling constant is strongly renormalized [20], and second, since we are taking into\naccount hoppings and exchanges up to 5-th coordination spheres the order parameter\nin case of dx2 \u2212y2 -symmetry have the following form [32]:\n\u2206k =\n\n2\nX\n\n\u2206m (cos(mkx a) \u2212 cos(mky a)).\n\n(2)\n\nm=1\n\nComparison of experimental [1, 2] data on NCCO and and our theoretical results on\ndoping dependence of SC phase transition temperature Tc (x) are presented in Fig. 2b.\nIn the inset there is the same Tc (x) dependence but for wider doping range. Two\nmaximums of Tc at x = 0.15 and x = 0.53 are clearly seen. Also, there is very small\nmaximum at x = 0.08. Previously in the t-J* model with self-consistently calculated\nspin correlation functions the additional maximum in Tc (x) for low x was obtained in\n[33].\nThe picture obtained could be understood with help of simple physical\nargumentation. In the BCS theory there is relation between Tc , density of states\nN (\u03b5F ) on Fermi level \u03b5F , and effective attraction V : Tc \u221d exp (\u22121/N (\u03b5F ) V ), N (\u03b5F ).\nObviously, maximum in Tc (x) will be gained upon coincidence of chemical potential and\nVan-Hove singularity. In the t-J model without spin fluctuations the only maximum in\nTc (x) stems from one Van-Hove singularity, corresponding to flat region in dispersion\naround (\u03c0, 0) point. As well known, in this case in nearest-neighbor approximation the\noptimal doping value is xopt = 0.33, while considering neighbors in more then three\ncoordination spheres optimal doping become xopt = 0.53 - in the inset in Fig. 2b\nthere is one maximum Tc (x) at this concentration. With inclusion of three-center\ninteraction terms (t-J* model) but without short-range magnetic order additional\nsingularity appears due to flat dispersion around (\u03c0, \u03c0). But this point is the bottom of\nthe conductivity band and chemical potential enters this singularity only at extremely\nlow x \u2264 0.07 where the mobility of carriers is low and AFM order is strong. All this\nleads to unfavourability of superconducting state. But in the t-J* model with proper\naccount for spin correlation functions additional Van-Hove singularity appears at \u22121.25\neV due to saddle point around (\u03c0, 0.4\u03c0) (see Fig. 1). This additional singularity gives\nmaximum in Tc (x) at x \u2248 0.15. It is this singularity where the chemical potential is\nsituated at optimal doping. It is this fact leads to the distance between position of \u03bc and\nVan-Hove singularity, corresponding to plateau around (\u03c0, 0), become \u2206EV H = 0.27 eV,\nthat is very close to experimentally observed \u221d 0.25 \u00f7 0.35 eV in n-type cuprates. Note,\nthat small maximum in Tc (x) around x = 0.08 stems from shoulder in density of states\nat \u22121.2 eV (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, since the free energy of the AFM phase is lower\nthen energies of normal and superconducting phases, this small maximum as well as the\nrest of Tc (x) at concentrations lower then x < 0.14 and situated under experimentally\nobtained N\u00e9el temperature TN (x) must not be observed in experiment.\n5. Now we will turn to the p-type cuprates with effective singlet-triplet t-J* model.\nComparison of dispersions in this model and t-J* model in non-superconducting phase\n\n\fProperties of normal and superconducting phases in the low-energy models . . .\n\n7\n\nFigure 3. (a) - Comparison of the t-J* model (dotted curve) and the effective singlettriplet t-J* model (bold solid curve - singlet subband, dash-dotted curves - triplet\nsubbands) dispersions with spin fluctuations for optimally doped x = 0.15 p-type\ncuprates. Chemical potential was self-consistently calculated in the singlet-triplet t-J*\nmodel shown by dashed line. (b) - p-type cuprates phase diagram: calculated Tc (x) in\nthe singlet-triplet t-J* model (solid bold curve) and simple t-J* model (dashed curve)\nare shown. In the inset the calculated Tc (x) for both these models in nearest-neighbor\napproximation, without three-center interaction terms and without spin fluctuations\nis presented.\n\nare presented in Fig. 3a. Because in this model there are two subbands - singlet and\ntriplet, and there is also singlet-triplet hybridization, beside SC paring in each of the\nsubbands there could be an interband pairing. So, in p-type besides the typical for\nthe t-J* model spin fluctuation mechanism there is additional spin-exciton mechanism\nof pairing [34] due to singlet-triplet hybridization, and the Tc (x) phase diagram for\nthe effective singlet-triplet model is different from the phase diagram of the simple\nt-J model. Namely, in the nearest-neighbor approximation, neglecting three-center\ninteraction terms and spin fluctuations, the optimal doping value is changes from typical\nto t-J model value x = 0.33 to x = 0.315 and the maximum value of Tc (x) is increased.\nAlso, around x = 0.6 the new \"dome\" of superconductivity appears due to triplet\nsubband (see inset in Fig. 3b). But with inclusion of three-center terms, short-range\nmagnetic order and hoppings and exchanges up to 5-th coordination sphere, the influence\nof singlet-triplet induced SC pairing becomes small as seen in Fig. 3b. The \"dome\" of\nsuperconductivity connected to triplet subband shifted to higher doping concentration\nand can't realize in experiment.\nEvidently, the concurrence of spin-exciton mechanism with processes destructing\nSC pairs leads to constructive contribution to the Tc (x) dependence. Comparison\nwith t-J* model shows that spin-exciton mechanism leads to changes in the phase\ndiagram - optimal doping value becomes slightly lower and the maximal Tc (x) becomes\nslightly higher. But because the value of singlet-triple hybridization is numerically\nsmall - corresponding hopping tST \u2248 0.25t (see [22]), the contribution of spin-exciton\nmechanism is also small. So, in present theory, the spin-exciton mechanism gives small\n\n\fProperties of normal and superconducting phases in the low-energy models . . .\n\n8\n\ncontribution compared to dominating spin fluctuation induced SC pairing. Obtained\nphase diagram Fig. 3b contradicts experimental one, while obtained in the same\napproximations phase diagram for n-type is in very good agreement with experiment\nFig. 2b. Also, calculated location of the Fermi level relative to Van-Hove singularity\ncorresponding to flat region at (\u03c0, 0) is \u2206EV H = 0.52 eV contrary to experimentally\nobserved value \u2206EV H \u2264 0.03 eV in all p-type cuprates [3]. Therefore, there is another\nreason (beside the presence of the triplet states) for the asymmetry in p- and n-type\nsystems to take place. Most likely, this reason connected to differences in AFM phase\nformation [35] - in n-type systems the AFM phase due to nature of doping ion could\nbe described in diluted Heisenberg model [36] while in p-type the effects of magnetic\nfrustrations must be taken into account. Frustrations could lead to incommensurate\nspin fluctuations observed in inelastic neutron scattering in p-type [37] but not in ntype cuprates [38]. Also, indirect evidences of frustration's importance in p-type are\nspin glass state and, probably, charge separation. In our approach the non-uniform\nmagnetic state is not taken into account, so it is justified only to n-type systems. That\nis why obtained in present theory phase diagram for p-type is quite different from\nexperimentally observed.\n6. Summarizing, in the framework of effective model for n-type High-Tc cuprates\nand simple physical approximations taking into account spin fluctuations beyond\nHubbard I we obtained good agreement with experimental data, such as the evolution\nof chemical potential with doping, Fermi surface at optimally doped NCCO and Tc (x)\ndependence. Although analogous results of Tc (x) dependence were previously obtained\nin FLEX approximation [39], the presented approach is superior due to its physical\ntransparency and the explicit account for strong electron correlations, which plays\nvery significant role in HTSC. We have shown, that the underlying physics of Tc (x)\nconcentration dependence in n-type cuprates is quite different from p-type counterparts.\nNamely, as the consequence of sort-range magnetic order (and corresponding spin\nfluctuations) the system have tendency to restore AFM symmetry. This leads to changes\nin dispersion so the flat areas appears around (\u03c0, 0.4\u03c0) (and symmetric to it) point. Flat\nregion produces additional Van-Hove singularity. Due to this transformation of density\nof states the new \"dome\" of superconductivity appears at x around 0.15. This \"dome\"\nis in remarkably good agreement with experimental results - not only the value of the\noptimal doping xopt and corresponding Tc (x) but also the range of dopant concentrations\nwhere the superconductivity exist are reproduced. We will mention again, that in\npresent investigation there were no fitting parameters - all parameters of effective model\nin strict relationship with microscopic parameters of the multiband p-d model. And\nthese microscopic parameters were determined in our previous papers from ARPES data\non undoped AFM cuprates. So, we have formulated quantitative microscopic theory of\nHigh-Tc superconductivity in electron doped cuprates. This theory properly (i.e. in\nagreement with the experiment) describes properties not only in superconducting but\nalso in normal phases of HTSC.\nFor p-type cuprates the influence of singlet-triplet hybridization is analyzed. Due\n\n\fProperties of normal and superconducting phases in the low-energy models . . .\n\n9\n\nto this hybridization the spin-exciton mechanism of SC pairing appears to take place,\nbut because of small numerical value of singlet-triplet hybridization the spin-exciton\nmechanism gives only very small contribution to the Tc (x) dependence. We believe that\nthe main mechanism of SC pairing in p-type systems is the spin fluctuation induced\nmechanism, but in order to explain complicated phase diagram of these compounds one\nmust take into account magnetic frustrations, that takes place in underdoped region\nand leads to non-uniform magnetic state, incommensurability of spin fluctuations and\nphase separation observed in hole doped cuprates.\nConcerning the electron-phonon interaction which was not taken into account in\nthe present work, there are strong indications of weakness of this interaction in n-type\ncuprates. First, the isotope effect is almost absent in these compounds [40]. Second,\nthere is no kink feature along (0, 0) \u2212 (\u03c0, \u03c0) direction [41] that is significantly different\nfrom p-type where appearance of kink considered as evidence for strong electron-phonon\ninteraction. But in hole doped cuprates there could be additional contribution due to\nthis interaction [42].\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are thankful to V.V. Val'cov and D.M.
