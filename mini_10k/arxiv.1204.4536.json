Introduction\nSolar magnetic flux emerges at various spatial scales (e.g. Parnell et al., 2009).\nGolovko (1998) revealed a power-law relation between the maximum magnetic\nflux and the lifetime of active regions. Otsuji et al. (2011) found a relation\nbetween the flux growth rate and the maximum magnetic flux in the form of a\npower-law function.\n1 The Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Siberian Branch,\nRussian Academy of Sciences\nemail: hlystova@iszf.irk.ru\n\nSOLA: khlystova.tex; 31 October 2018; 5:44; p. 1\n\n\fA. Khlystova\n\nMeasurements of Doppler velocities indicated that there is a vertical plasma\nupflow up to 1 km s\u22121 at the polarity inversion line when active regions emerge in\nthe solar photosphere (Brants, 1985a; Brants, 1985b; Tarbell et al., 1989; Lites,\nSkumanich, and Martinez Pillet, 1998; Strous and Zwaan, 1999; Kubo, Shimizu,\nand Lites, 2003; Guglielmino et al., 2006; Grigor'ev, Ermakova, and Khlystova,\n2007; Grigor'ev, Ermakova, and Khlystova, 2009). Grigor'ev, Ermakova, and\nKhlystova (2007) revealed high Doppler velocities of about 1.7 km s\u22121 at the\nbeginning of the emergence of the powerful active region NOAA 10488 at heliographic coordinates N08 E31 (B0 +4.9\u25e6 ). The observed Doppler velocities have\nnot been compared with the parameters of the magnetic fields.\nThe cold and dense plasma contained inside magnetic flux emerging into the\nsolar atmosphere flows down along the magnetic field lines with velocities of up to\n2 km s\u22121 at the photospheric level (Gopasyuk, 1967; Gopasyuk, 1969; Kawaguchi\nand Kitai, 1976; Bachmann, 1978; Zwaan, Brants, and Cram, 1985; Brants,\n1985a; Brants, 1985b; Brants and Steenbeek, 1985; Lites, Skumanich, and Martinez Pillet, 1998; Solanki et al., 2003; Lagg et al., 2007; Xu, Lagg, and Solanki,\n2010). Observations of pores revealed a statistical relation between the Doppler\nvelocity of plasma downflow and the magnetic field strength. Bonaccini et al.\n(1991), studying a large pore, found that the strong magnetic fields correlate\nlinearly with downflow Doppler velocities in the form B = 500 V, where B is in\nGauss and V is in km s\u22121 . Keil et al. (1999) found that downflow Doppler velocities inside pores correlate positively with the magnetic field strength. Cho et al.\n(2010) analysed small pores less than 200 , which were not related to magnetic\nflux emergence, by using high spatial resolution data from Hinode. The authors\nrevealed a negative correlation between positive Doppler velocities and the magnetic field strength, i.e. small downflow Doppler velocities corresponded to strong\nmagnetic fields. Grigor'ev, Ermakova, and Khlystova (2011) have shown that in\nthe emerging active region during the formation of pores the plasma downflow\nDoppler velocity increases linearly with the magnetic field strength.\nEstimations of horizontal velocities in the emerging active regions were performed indirectly. A wide range of velocity values from 0.1 to 5.5 km s\u22121 were\nobtained by analysing displacements of magnetic field structures (Frazier, 1972;\nSchoolman, 1973; Harvey and Martin, 1973; Chou and Wang, 1987; Barth and\nLivi, 1990; Strous and Zwaan, 1999; Hagenaar, 2001; Grigor'ev, Ermakova, and\nKhlystova, 2009; Otsuji et al., 2011). Considering the separation of opposite\npolarity poles in 24 bipolar pairs Chou and Wang (1987) found no relation\nof horizontal velocities neither with the average magnetic field strength nor\nwith the total unsigned magnetic flux. Otsuji et al. (2011) studied 101 emerging\nflux regions with various spatial scales. They showed a power-law relation with\nnegative index between the horizontal velocities of the separation of opposite\npolarity poles and the maximum value of magnetic flux.\nKhlystova (2011) presented a statistical study the photospheric Doppler velocities in 83 active regions with a total unsigned magnetic flux above 1021 Mx. A\ncentre to limb dependence of negative Doppler velocities was established, which\nindicates that the horizontal velocities of plasma outflows are higher than the\nvertical upflow velocities during the first hours of the emergence of active regions.\nIn this article we study the statistical relations between Doppler velocities\nand magnetic field parameters during the emergence of active regions.\n\nSOLA: khlystova.tex; 31 October 2018; 5:44; p. 2\n\n\fRelationship between Velocities and Magnetic Field Parameters in the Emerging Flux Regions\n\n2. Data Analysis\nWe used full-disc SOHO/MDI data (Scherrer et al., 1995). The temporal resolution of the photospheric magnetograms and Dopplergrams is 1 minute, while\nthat of the continuum is 96 minutes. The spatial resolution of the data is 400 .\nMagnetograms with a 1.8.2 calibration level were used (Ulrich et al., 2009).\nWe have cropped a region of emerging magnetic flux from a time sequence\nof data taking into account its displacement caused by solar rotation. This\ndisplacement was calculated by the differential rotation law for photospheric\nmagnetic fields (Snodgrass, 1983) and the cross-correlation analysis of two magnetograms adjacent in time. A precise spatial superposition of the data was\nachieved by cropping fragments with identical coordinates from simultaneously\nacquired magnetograms and Dopplergrams. For correct processing of the data,\nwe chose the cropped region in a way that it excluded the area outside the\nlimb. For the Dopplergrams the contribution of solar differential rotation and\nother factors distorting the Doppler velocity signal were removed by using the\ntechnique described in Grigor'ev, Ermakova, and Khlystova (2007).\nThe sequence of the fragments obtained has been used to calculate the temporal variations of the parameters under study. The calculation area was limited to\nthe region of the emerging magnetic flux. The boundary of emerging flux region\nwas visually inspected.\nThe total unsigned magnetic flux of active regions was calculated inside isolines \u00b160 G taking into account the projection effect and assuming that the\nmagnetic field vector is perpendicular to the solar surface:\n\u03a6 = S0\n\nN\nX\n|Bi |\n,\ncos\u03b8\ni\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the total unsigned magnetic flux in Mx, S0 is the area of the solar\nsurface of pixel in the centre of solar disc in cm2 , N is the number of pixels\nwhere |Bi | > 60 G, Bi is the line of sight magnetic field strength of ith pixel\nin G, \u03b8i is the heliocentric angle of ith pixel. The maximum total unsigned\nmagnetic flux \u03a6max was determined by the maximum inflection point in the\nincrease of the magnetic flux curve or by the last value of the datasets (for active\nregions passing beyond the west limb or with insufficiently downloaded data).\nThe signal background that existed before the emergence of active regions was\nsubtracted from the maximum total unsigned magnetic flux. Magnetic saturation\nin measurements of the magnetic field strength in SOHO/MDI was controlled\n(Liu, Norton, and Scherrer, 2007); it was attained only in three of the active\nregions considered.\nThe total unsigned magnetic flux growth rate d\u03a6/dt and absolute value of the\nmaximum magnetic field strength Hmax were calculated in the first 12 hours of\nthe emergence of the magnetic flux for large and small active regions or from\nbeginning to maximum of the total unsigned magnetic flux for ephemeral active\nregions.\nPhotospheric plasma flows are characterised by the peak (absolute maximum)\nvalues of negative and positive Doppler velocities Vmax\u2212 and Vmax+ which were\n\nSOLA: khlystova.tex; 31 October 2018; 5:44; p. 3\n\n\fA. Khlystova\n\ndetermined in the first 12 hours of the magnetic flux emergence for large and\nsmall active regions or from beginning to maximum of the total unsigned magnetic flux for ephemeral active regions. The magnetic flux emergence begins with\nthe appearance of the loop apex where the magnetic field is horizontal; therefore,\nthe time interval we analysed started 30 minutes before the appearance of the\nline of sight magnetic fields. Continuum images were used to control the possible\nformation of sunspots with Evershed flows in the first hours of the emergence of\nactive regions to eliminate their contribution. The maximum Doppler velocity of\nthese flows in SOHO/MDI data with low spatial resolution can reach 2 km s\u22121\n(Bai, Scherrer, and Bogart, 1998).\nThe position of the active region on the solar disc is expressed by the heliocentric angle \u03b8:\n\u03b8 = arcsin(r/R),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the disc centre to the place of the active region\nemergence and R is the solar radius. \u03b8 is also approximately the angle between\nthe normal to the surface and the line of sight component of the emerging\nmagnetic flux.\nWe performed a regression analysis of the data. There is at least one inflection\npoint in the considered dependencies. Therefore, linear or quadratic polynomials\nwere used as approximation functions. The choice of the polynomial degree\nwas based on the minimum values of the standard deviations. The results are\ngiven in the form of polynomial equations which, according to the F-statistic,\nare significant. The confidence intervals for the means were calculated with a\nconfidence probability of 99%.\n\n3. The Investigated Active Regions\nWe have studied 224 active regions which emerged on the visible side of the solar\ndisc from 1999 to 2008 (see Figure 1). The selected active regions have different\nspatial scales and emerge at different distances from the solar disc centre. They\nare isolated from high concentrations of existing magnetic fields (the presence\nof single poles with total unsigned magnetic flux not higher than 0.5 \u00d7 1021 Mx\nin the region of the direct emergence of the active region for the first hours\nwas allowed). Sufficiently complete data series with a temporal resolution of\n1 minute for the first hours of magnetic flux emergence are available for the\nselected objects.\nThe statistical analysis includes the following.\n1. According to the maximum value of the total unsigned magnetic flux (in the\ntwo polarities):\n\u2022 68 ephemeral active regions (2.6 \u00d7 1018 Mx < \u03a6max < 4.07 \u00d7 1020 Mx);\n\u2022 130 small active regions (4.07 \u00d7 1020 Mx < \u03a6max < 8 \u00d7 1021 Mx);\n\u2022 26 large active regions (\u03a6max > 8 \u00d7 1021 Mx).\n\nSOLA: khlystova.tex; 31 October 2018; 5:44; p. 4\n\n\fRelationship between Velocities and Magnetic Field Parameters in the Emerging Flux Regions\n\na) Ephemeral Active Regions\n\n3\u20221020\n\n8\u20221021\n\n\u03a6max, Mx\n\n\u03a6max, Mx\n\n4\u20221020\n\n2\u20221020\n1\u20221020\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n\u03b8, degrees\n\nc)\n\n80\n\nb)\n\nSmall Active Regions\n\n0\n\n20\n\n6\u20221021\n4\u20221021\n2\u20221021\n40\n60\n\u03b8, degrees\n\n80\n\nLarge Active Regions\n\n\u03a6max, Mx\n\n6\u20221022\n5\u20221022\n4\u20221022\n3\u20221022\n2\u20221022\n1\u20221022\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n\u03b8, degrees\n\n80\n\nFigure 1. Maximum total unsigned magnetic flux of the (a) ephemeral, (b) small and (c)\nlarge active regions versus the heliocentric angle that corresponds to the beginning of the\nemergence of magnetic fluxes. The total magnetic flux maximum was determined by the\nmaximum inflection point in the increase of the magnetic flux curve (marked by points) or by\nthe last measurement (marked by triangles). Active regions with magnetic saturation are also\nmarked by triangles. In active regions marked by triangles, the maximum of the total unsigned\nmagnetic flux may be higher.\n\nThe limits of the total unsigned magnetic flux for ephemeral active regions\nwere taken from Hagenaar (2001). The limit between the large and small\nactive regions is considered to be the maximum magnetic flux in one polarity;\nit is taken equal to 5 \u00d7 1021 Mx (Garcia de La Rosa, 1984; Zwaan, 1987). In\nthe present investigation the limit between the large and small active regions\nwas chosen at the total unsigned magnetic flux in two polarities, equal to\n8 \u00d7 1021 Mx, since all active regions with the total unsigned magnetic flux\nabove this level contain sunspots and their spatial size exceeds the size of a\nsupergranule.\n2. According to the distances from the solar disc centre:\n\u2022 72 active regions near the solar disc centre (\u03b8 < 25\u25e6 );\n\u2022 98 active regions at medium distance from disc centre (25\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 50\u25e6 );\n\u2022 54 active regions near the limb (\u03b8 > 50\u25e6 ).\nThe maximum Doppler velocities of the convection flow in the quiet Sun\nwere calculated at different distances from the disc centre using SOHO/MDI\ndata (Figure 2).

Peak (a) negative and (b) positive Doppler velocities of the convective flows in the\nquiet Sun versus the heliocentric angle for SOHO/MDI data.\n\nvelocities were measured within a region of size 4000 \u00d74000 whose displacement\nwas tracked based on the differential rotation law of Doppler structures in the\nphotosphere (Snodgrass and Ulrich, 1990). The selected region was going through\nthe W00 \u2013 W75 range of longitudes along the equator during the period under\nstudy. The contribution of solar differential rotation and other factors distorting\nthe Doppler velocity signal were removed by using the technique described by\nGrigor'ev, Ermakova, and Khlystova (2007).\nIn Figure 2 one observes that Doppler velocities of convection flows increases\nwith the heliocentric angle. For the points with \u03b8 > 60\u25e6 there is a tendency for\nDoppler velocities to decrease. This may be due to the Doppler velocities being\nmeasured in higher atmospheric layers near the limb, due to the increase in the\noptical thickness, where the atmosphere is convectively stable and convection\nflows are damped.\n4.

The\ndependencies obtained indicate that during the emergence of active regions the\nhorizontal velocities of plasma outflows (\u03b8 > 50\u25e6 ) exceed the vertical upflow velocities (\u03b8 < 25\u25e6 ). Generally, the Doppler velocities accompanying the emergence\nof active regions are higher than those of convective flows, however, sometimes\nthey are comparable. For small and large active regions the horizontal Doppler\nvelocity component substantially exceeds horizontal Doppler velocities of the\nconvection flows in the quiet Sun, which are less than 1200 m s\u22121 (Figure 3 b, c,\nand Figure 2 a the points with \u03b8 > 50\u25e6 ).\n4.2. Vertical Doppler Velocities\nFor the active regions emerging near the solar disc centre (\u03b8 < 25\u25e6 ), peak\nnegative Doppler velocities (plasma upflow) have a high dispersion and correlate neither with the magnetic flux growth rate (the correlation ratio is \u22120.30)\nnor with the maximum magnetic field strength (the correlation ratio is \u22120.22)\n(Figure 4).

Horizontal Dopper Velocity\nKhlystova (2012) has carried out a detailed analysis of photospheric flows in\nfour active regions emerging near the solar limb. It has been found that extended regions of Doppler velocities with different signs are formed in the first\nhours of the magnetic flux emergence in the horizontal velocity field. The observed Doppler velocities substantially exceed the separation velocities of the\nphotospheric magnetic flux outer boundaries and most likely are caused by the\nsignificant component of the velocities of plasma downflow being carried out into\nthe solar atmosphere by emerging magnetic flux.\nOne observes in Figure 3 that the horizontal Doppler velocity component\n(\u03b8 > 50\u25e6 ) in the region of emerging magnetic fluxes has a wide range of values.\nFor the active regions emerging near the limb (\u03b8 > 50\u25e6 ), the peak positive\nand negative Doppler velocities of photospheric plasma flows show a quadratic\nrelation with the magnetic flux growth rate (correlation ratios 0.78 and \u22120.73)\nand a linear relation with the maximum magnetic field strength (correlation\nratios 0.58 and \u22120.56) (Figure 6). Strong magnetic fields are oriented mainly\nperpendicular to the surface after the emergence. Therefore, the magnetic field\nstrength in active regions near the limb is 2 \u2013 3 times smaller than that one in\nactive regions near the solar disc centre, because of the projection effects of the\nmagnetic field vector to the line of sight (Figure 6 b and Figure 5 b).\nRegression analysis of the data yielded the following equations:\nVmax+ = 782.27 + 6.68 \u00d7 10\u221218 d\u03a6/dt \u2212 9.65 \u00d7 10\u221239 (d\u03a6/dt)2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nSOLA: khlystova.tex; 31 October 2018; 5:44; p. 9\n\n\fA.

This supports theoretical\nmodels in which the velocities of draining plasma have a significant horizontal\ncomponent at the beginning of the magnetic flux emergence (see Shibata et al.\n(1990), Archontis et al.

The relation between (a) peak negative Doppler velocities, (b) peak positive\nDoppler velocities and (c) the magnetic flux growth rate in the first hours of the emergence of\nactive regions with total unsigned magnetic flux at the maximum of their development \u03a6max .\nThe symbol colours are the same as in Figure 4. The \u03a6max was determined by the maximum\ninflection point in the increase of the flux curve (marked by points) or by the last measurement\n(marked by triangles). In active regions marked by triangles, the \u03a6max may be higher.\n\nThe dependence is theoretically expectable. The magnetic flux emerge due\nto the action of the magnetic buoyant force which is proportional to the square\nof the magnetic field density B 2 (Parker, 1955). The higher the magnetic field\nstrength, the higher the magnetic pressure and the lower the gas pressure inside\nthe magnetic structure. The low gas pressure leads to a large magnetic buoyancy\nforce and, thus, to an increase in the magnetic flux growth rate.\n4.5. The Relation of Parameters between the Beginning and Maximum\nDevelopment of Active Regions\nActive regions emerging near the solar disc centre (\u03b8 < 25\u25e6 ) are considered. Peak\nnegative Doppler velocities in the first hours of the magnetic flux emergence\ndo not show any relation with the total unsigned magnetic flux at maximum\ndevelopment of the active regions (Figure 8 a). Comparison of the peak positive\nDoppler velocities and the magnetic flux growth rate with the maximum value\nof total unsigned magnetic flux reveals a power-law relation with high dispersion\n(Figure 8 b, c). A power-law relation, but with less dispersion, between the flux\ngrowth rate and the the maximum value of magnetic flux has been found earlier\nby Otsuji et al. (2011). In the present investigation the weak dependence between\n\nSOLA: khlystova.tex; 31 October 2018; 5:44; p. 11\n\n\fA. Khlystova\n\nthe parameters under consideration can be explained by the fact that active\nregion magnetic flux emerges in separate fragments on time scales from several\nhours to 5 \u2013 7 days. Therefore, the parameters of magnetic fields and Doppler\nvelocities in the first hours of emergence do not characterise an active region as\na whole.\n5. Conclusions\nThe study of plasma flow Doppler velocities and magnetic field parameters\nduring the emergence of active regions at the photospheric level has revealed\nthe following statistical relationships:\n1. Peak values of negative Doppler velocities accompanying the magnetic flux\nemergence in the first hours show an increase with the heliocentric angle \u03b8.\nThe observed relation shows that horizontal velocities of plasma outflows are\nhigher than the vertical upflow velocities.\n2. The upflow plasma Doppler velocities have no relation with parameters of\nmagnetic fields and, thus, do not characterise the power of the emerging\nmagnetic flux.\n3. The downflow plasma Doppler velocities have high values, which substantially\nexceed Doppler velocities of convection flows in the quiet Sun. They are\nrelated quadratically with the magnetic flux growth rate and linearly with\nthe maximum magnetic field strength. The main reason for the observed\ndownflows is considered to be a draining of the cold plasma, being carried\nout into the solar atmosphere by the emerging magnetic flux.\n4. The horizontal plasma outflow Doppler velocities are connected quadratically\nwith the magnetic flux growth rate and linearly with the maximum magnetic\nfield strength. Possibly the horizontal flows are connected with draining of\nplasma which has a significant horizontal component at the beginning of the\nmagnetic flux emergence.\n5. There is a quadratic dependence with relatively low dispersion and a high\ncorrelation ratio of 0.88 between the magnetic flux growth rate and the maximum strength of magnetic fields. The observed relation is consistent with the\nmagnetic buoyancy law.\n6. There is a weak power-law dependence of peak positive Doppler velocities and\nthe magnetic flux growth rate in the first hours of the emergence of active\nregions with the maximum value of the total unsigned magnetic flux.\nAcknowledgements The author is grateful to the referee for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.
