Define the Dirichlet Laplacian\noperator \u2206. Then the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian on the \u03a9 is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206\u03a8n + \u03bbn \u03a8n = 0\n\uf8f3\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u03a8n |(\u2202\u03a9) = 0\n\nThen Polya's conjecture[1] says that: for every \u03bbn , it obey the inequality:\n\u03bbn \u2265\n\n4\u03c0\nn.\nA\n\n(1.2)\n\nWhere A is the area of the domain. Polya himself proved that this conjecture is right\nfor the tiling domain, but the general case for the arbitrary domain is still open. Up\nto now, the best result is obtained by Li and Yau[2]:\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03bbj >\n\n2\u03c0n2\n,n \u2208 N\nA\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to suggesting a physical approach to Polya's\nconjecture, based on the similarity between the inequality 1.2 and the Bonomol'nyi\nbound in soliton theory[3].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f2. Nonlinear sigma model\nIn this section, we brifely review the nonlinear O(3) \u03c3 model in (2 + 1) dimension\nand its soliton solution[4]. It involve three real scalar fields \u03c6(x\u03bc ) \u2261 {\u03c6a (x\u03bc ), a =\n1, 2, 3, x\u03bc = (t, x, y)} with the constrain:\n\u03c6a \u03c6a = 1.\n\n(2.1)\n\nThus, the fields lie on the unit sphere S2 .\nSubject to this constrain the lagrangian density reads\n1\nL = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6a \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6a .\n4\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich is invariant under global O(3) rotations in internal space. From the lagrangian\nwe can get the equation of motion\n\u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c6a \u2212 (\u03c6b \u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c6b )\u03c6a = 0.\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich for the static case reduces to\n\u2206\u03c6a \u2212 (\u03c6b \u2206\u03c6b )\u03c6a = 0.\n\n(2.4)\n\nFrom the constrain equation 2.1, we can get\n\u03c6b \u2206\u03c6b = \u2212\u2207\u03c6b \u2022 \u2207\u03c6b .\n\n(2.5)\n\n\u2206\u03c6a + (\u2207\u03c6b \u2022 \u2207\u03c6b )\u03c6a = 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\nso the equation 2.4 changes to\n\nDefine the energy density E (x, y) = \u2207\u03c6b \u2022 \u2207\u03c6b , then the potential energy is given by\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\nV =\n(\u2207\u03c6b \u2022 \u2207\u03c6b )dxdy =\nE (x, y)dxdy.\n(2.7)\n4\n4\nNotice the similarity between the equation 1.1 and 2.6.\nThe problem is completely specified by giving the boundary condition. We take\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nlim \u03c6 (r, \u03b8) = \u03c6 0 .\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.8)\n\n\f\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\nwhere the unit vector \u03c6 0 is a constant vector. We will take it to be \u03c6 0 = (0, 0, 1).\nFor a soliton solution, we have the Bonomol'nyi bound for the energy of the\nsoliton,\nE = V > 2\u03c0 |Q|\nwhere the Q is called the topological charge, or winding number:\nZ\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n1\nQ=\n\u03c6 \u2022 (\u2202x \u03c6 \u00d7 \u2202y \u03c6 )dxdy \u2208 N.\n4\u03c0 \u03a9\n\n(2.9)\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe mean value of the energy density of the soliton with winding number Q = n\nwill be\nE =\n\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n4V\n>\n|Q| =\nn\nA\nA\nA\n\n(2.11)\n\nIf we can find some function between the eigenfunction \u03a8n for the domain and\n\u2192\n\u2212\nthe n\u2212soliton solution \u03c6 n of the sigma model on the domain,\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03a8n = F ( \u03c6 n ),\n\n(2.12)\n\nthat is the duality between the waves on the domain and the solitons on the domain,\nmaybe we can find the proof of the Polya's conjecture.\n\n3. The Polya's conjecture on the disc\nIn this section, we consider the special case of the Polya's conjecture, the conjecture\non the disc with the radius R0 .\nThe eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian operator can be solved explicitly. The\neigenfunction can be written as\n\u03a8mn (r, \u03b8) = cJm (\u03bbmn r)(a cos m\u03b8 + b sin m\u03b8).\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere Jm (x) is the Bessel function, and the eigenvalues\nn\n\u03bb2mn = (\u03b1m\n/R0 )2\n\n(3.2)\n\nn\nwhere \u03b1m\nis the n\u2212zero of the Jm (x). The radial function R(r) satisfy the Bessel\n\nfunction:\nR\u2032\u2032 +\n\nR\u2032\nm2\n+ (\u03bb2m \u2212 2 )R = 0.\nr\nr\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fThis equation also can be obtained by the energy functional\nZ R0\nm2 R2\n\u2212 \u03bb2m R2 )rdr\nE=\n(R\u20322 +\n2\nr\n0\n\n(3.4)\n\nthrough the Eular-Lagrange equation.\n\nFor a special eigenfunction Jm (\u03bbmn r), the energy functional is given by\nZ R0\nZ \u03bbmn R0\nm2\n2\n\u2032\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nE=\n(\u03bbmn (Jm (\u03bbmn r)) + ( 2 \u2212 \u03bbmn )Jm (\u03bbmn r))rdr = 1/2\n(Jm\u22121\n(x) + Jm+1\n(x) \u2212 2Jm\n(x))xd\nr\n0\n0\n(3.5)\nNext we consider the nonlinear sigma model on the disc. With the stereographic\nprojection of the S2 , we can get\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u03c6 =\n\n1\n(u + u\u2217 , \u2212i(u \u2212 u\u2217 ), uu\u2217 \u2212 1)\n\u2217\n1 + uu\n\n(3.6)\n\n\u03c61 +i\u03c62\n.\n1\u2212\u03c63\n\nand the complex function u =\nWith the hedgehog ansatz\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u03c6 (r, \u03b8) = (sin f (r) cos n\u03b8, sin f (r) sin n\u03b8, cos f (r)),\nwhere the function f (r) is called the profile function and satisfy some boundary\ncondition, which is\nf (0) = \u03c0,\nand\nlim f (r) = 0.\n\nx\u2192R0\n\nThe n is the winding number. we get\nu(r, \u03b8) = tan(f (r)/2) exp(in\u03b8)\nand the equation of motion for the complex field is\n2\u2207u \u2022 \u2207u \u2217\nu = 0.\n1 + uu\u2217\n\n(3.7)\n\nf \u2032 n2 sin 2f\n\u2212\n= 0.\nr\n2r 2\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u2206u \u2212\nSo the equation for the f (r) is\nf \u2032\u2032 +\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fObviously this equation is a nonlinear differential equation and can be solved numerically (with the shooting method). If the value of f (r) is obtained then we can use\nit to calculate the static energy and so on. As before, this equation can be obtained\nby the energy functional\nE = 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nR0\n\nn2 sin2 f\n)rdr.\n(f +\nr2\n\u20322\n\n0\n\n(3.9)\n\nNotice the similarity and the difference between the two energy functional 3.4\nand 3.9.\n\n4. The duality\nWe want to build the duality between the eigenfunctions and the soliton solutions\non the disc, and from this duality we relate the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator\nto the energy of the dual soliton, and then from the Bonomol'nyi bound we will get\nthe Polya's conjecture.\nIn the disc case, we assume the dual soliton correspondence to the eigenfunction\u03a8mn\n\u2192\n\u2212\nis the N\u2212 soliton \u03c6 N , then the natural question is how to relate those two functions\nand get the function N(m, n). Since we have no explicit form of the soliton solution,\nwe must guess. Finally we want to build the relation between the energy of those\ntwo solutions, such as\nEwave > Esoliton > 2\u03c0N.\n\n(4.1)\n\nand we need much more work to achieve this goal.\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we just give a general framework for solving the Polya's conjecture. We\nhope that our method can be applied to other related problems in the geometrical\nanalysis, such as: the first eigenvalue obey the inequality\n\u03bb1 >\n\na\n,\nr\u03a92\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fand the gap between the first two nonzero eigenvalues. We notice that the eigenvalues\nhave the dimension of the energy density.\nOn the physical side, some people believe that the fundamental particles in our\nuniverse should be described by the soliton solution of some nonlinear equation[5],\nsuch as the Skyrme model for the hadrons in QCD[6]. The duality between the wave\nand the soliton can shine some light on those ideas.\nFor the Neumann boundary, the the Polya's conjecture has the form of\n\u03bcn 6\n\n4\u03c0\nn.\nA\n\nWe didn't find any similar physical results. On the other hand, if we can find the\ndual Dirichlet system such that they obey\n\u03bbn + \u03bc n =\n\n8\u03c0\nn,\nA\n\nthen from the Polya's conjecture on the Dirichlet boundary we can get the problem\nfor the Neumann boundary. The T-duality in string change the Dirichlet boundary\nto the Neumann boundary, so we guess this duality should play some role in the\nNeumann boundary problem.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partly done at Beijing Normal University.
