Antiferromagnets, which carry no net external magnetic dipole moment, yet have\na periodic arrangement of the electron spins extending over macroscopic distances, should\nalso display magnetic noise, but this must be sampled at spatial wavelengths of order several interatomic spacings, rather than the macroscopic scales characteristic of ferromagnets. Here we present the first direct measurement of the fluctuations in the nanometre-scale\nspin- (charge-) density wave superstructure associated with antiferromagnetism in elemental\nChromium. The technique used is X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy, where coherent\nx-ray diffraction produces a speckle pattern that serves as a \"fingerprint\" of a particular\nmagnetic domain configuration. The temporal evolution of the patterns corresponds to do-\n\n1\n\n\fmain walls advancing and retreating over micron distances. While the domain wall motion\nis thermally activated at temperatures above 100K, it is not so at lower temperatures, and\nindeed has a rate which saturates at a finite value \u2013 consistent with quantum fluctuations - on\ncooling below 40K. Our work is important because it provides an important new measurement tool for antiferromagnetic domain engineering as well as revealing a fundamental new\nfact about spin dynamics in the simplest antiferromagnet.\n\nBecause of scientific and technical interest in ferromagnetic domains, there has been large,\nlong-standing activity on magnetic noise in ferromagnets as a direct witness of domain motion.\nAs antiferromagnets begin to find applications themselves, for example as pinning layers in spintronics, there is a need for measurements of the noise associated with moving antiferromagnetic\ndomains. Antiferromagnetic domain dynamics are also important because they are implicated\nin basic problems in condensed matter physics, such as high temperature superconductivity and\n'heavy' Fermions. Neutrons are an excellent non-local probe of antiferromagnetism and its dynamics [4]. However, a direct local probe of mesoscopic antiferromagnetic domain dynamics has\nnot been hitherto available because the magnetic dipole moments for antiferromagnets vanish on\nthe scale of a nanometer, rendering the domain fluctuations responsible for noise essentially invisible to the direct magnetometer probes (e.g. superconducting interference devices) which have\nbeen so successful for ferromagnets [5].\n\nChromium is a body-centred cubic (bcc) metal with an antiferromagnetic state nearly described by the simple rule that the electrons surrounding each Cr atom have magnetization oppo-\n\n2\n\n\fsite to those on the nearest neighbour Cr atoms. What actually occurs is sinusoidal modulation\nof this elementary magnetic structure, called a spin density wave (SDW) with wavelength \u03bb=6-8\nnm, along one of the three equivalent cubic (100) directions. A single crystal chromium sample\ncooled below the N\u00e9el temperature TN =311 K spontaneously breaks (see Fig. 1) into three types of\nmagnetic domains characterized by the three different choices for the SDW propagation direction\n[6]. The SDW is accompanied by a charge density wave (CDW), a combination of both itinerant\nand ionic charge modulation.\n\nX-ray microdiffraction reveals that the typical size of the SDW domains in bulk Cr samples\nis on the order of 1-30 \u03bcm [7]. Fluctuations of domain walls at fixed temperature have been\nstudied via random electrical telegraph noise in thin Cr films for temperatures above 140 K [8].\nEven though the measurements were done for mesoscopic samples, the effects on the electrical\nresistance R of the switching dynamics were small (\u03b4R/R\u223c10\u22125 ) and the interpretation difficult\nbecause R is an indirect probe of the underlying SDW and CDW order.\n\nWe report the first direct observations of domain wall fluctuations in bulk Cr using X-ray\nPhoton Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS), which overcomes the limitations of the classic bulk and\nlaser probes in that it accesses the short wavelength structure associated with the SDW directly.\nA coherent beam illuminating a partially ordered system (in our case consisting of SDW/CDW\ndomains) produces an interference pattern, also known as speckle [9, 10]. Due to the high sensitivity of speckle to minute changes in domain wall configuration, the time variation of the speckle\npattern directly reveals the dynamics of domain structure. Fig. 2a is a schematic of the experi-\n\n3\n\n\fmental configuration, and Figure 2b shows a speckle pattern of the (200) Bragg peak for the bcc\nCr lattice. Interference fringes arising from partial coherence of the x-ray beam are clearly seen in\nthe image as well as in the line scans shown in Fig. 2c. Incoherent diffraction would produce the\nGaussian-like profile represented by the black line in Fig. 2c. The lattice Bragg speckle pattern is\nstatic over 5 hrs indicating the high level of stability for our instrumentation and the sample.\n\nWe turn next to the speckle pattern for the (2-2\u03b4, 0, 0) CDW superlattice reflection, displayed\nfor 17 K at a variety of times in Fig. 3b. The patterns in subsequent frames, separated by 1,000\ns, grow increasingly dissimilar for longer time lags \u2013 patterns within frames collected more than\n3,000 s apart appear completely uncorrelated. Thus, the CDW speckle evolves with a characteristic\ntime of a few thousand seconds or less, much shorter than the >20,000 s relaxation time for the\nbcc Bragg speckle of Fig. 2c. This indicates that the changes in the CDW speckle are indeed\ndue to changes in the magnetic domain configuration, rather than some experimental artefact. For\nexample, drift of the x-ray beam or the cryostat, motion of crystalline defects within the Cr sample\nor any other effect not related to magnetic domain dynamics would inevitably cause changes in\nboth the CDW and (200) Bragg speckle.\n\nThe spatial sensitivity of the speckle to domain motion is described by two distinct lengths:\nthe first is 1/\u2206Q\u223c100\u00c5, where \u2206Q=10\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 is the total size of visible speckle pattern in reciprocal space (See Figs. 2b, 2c and 3b) and represents the minimum size of domains with a visible\nimpact on the speckle pattern. The second is the domain wall displacement necessary to produce\na speckle pattern that is highly dissimilar (or uncorrelated) to the original one. A combination of\n\n4\n\n\fx-ray microdiffraction images of domain configurations and speckle simulations indicate that this\nsecond length is 1 \u03bcm (see Methods and Supplementary Information).\n\nBeyond revealing that domain walls are moving by distances of order 1 \u03bcm, the data provide\nseveral other important quantities. For example, we can evaluate the autocorrelation function g2 (t):\ng2 (t) =\n\nhI(\u03c4 )I(\u03c4 + t)i\u03c4\n= 1 + A |F (Q, t)|2\n2\nhI(\u03c4 )i\u03c4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I(\u03c4 ) and I(\u03c4 +t) are the intensities in a given pixel for frames taken at times \u03c4 and \u03c4 +t respectively, F(Q,t) is the intermediate scattering function, A describes the beam coherence [9,10], and\nthe averaging is performed over times \u03c4 and pixels. Figure 3a shows |F(Q,t)|2 for several temperatures calculated from the CDW speckle. For large time delays the speckle patterns become uncorrelated, resulting in g2 (t)=1, corresponding to |F(Q,t)|2 =0. The dynamics are strongly temperaturedependent: upon cooling, the domain fluctuation times increases by nearly two decades. Surprisingly, below 40 K the times remain finite, rather than diverging as expected for thermally driven\nfluctuations.\n\nTwo distinct fluctuation timescales are visible in most datasets presented in Fig. 3a. The\nmeasured |F(Q,t)| was therefore modelled by a double exponential form:\n|F (Q, t)| = a exp[\u2212(t/\u03c4F )\u03b2 ] + (1 \u2212 a) exp[\u2212(t/\u03c4S )\u03b2 ]\n\n(2)\n\nA small value of a=0.03-0.10 indicates that the time dependence of |F(Q,t)| is mainly due to slow\nfluctuations. The value of the stretching exponent \u03b2 was found to be greater than 1, manifested\nby the \"compressed\" shape of the |F(Q,t)|. Compressed exponential relaxation has been observed\n5\n\n\ffor a variety of soft matter systems undergoing \"jamming\" transitions which results in arrested,\nsolid-like collective dynamics [11, 12, 13] with \u03b2 >1, as instead of liquid-like fluctuations with\n\u03b2 \u22641. Extended to our system, this points to elastically coupled dynamics between blocks of spins,\nsimilar to elastic collective depinning dynamics observed in CDW conductors [14], an observation\nalso consistent with the weakly pinned nature of SDW/CDW domains [15-17]. Furthermore, the\nfit value of \u03b2 at T<100K is approximately 1.5 (Fig. 4b), a universal value for dynamics of soft\ncondensed matter systems in a jammed state [18].\n\nFig. 4 shows the T-dependence of the slow relaxation times \u03c4S obtained from fits to autocorrelation functions in Fig. 3a. The 20% uncertainty in fitting parameters \u03c4S arises primarily from\ncounting statistics of the autocorrelation function g2 (t) (see Supplementary Information). Standard\nthermal activation (\u03c4t\u22121 = fo exp(\u2212\u2206E/kB T ), blue line) with a single attempt frequency fo and\nactivation barrier \u2206E/kB = 240 \u00b1 50K accounts for the data at high T. The thermal picture fails\nspectacularly at low temperature for T<40 K, and a switching mechanism which is temperatureindependent in this range is required. The simplest possibility is that switching between low-energy\ndomain wall configurations occurs via quantum tunneling, rather than classical thermal activation.\nA fit to the data that combines a thermally activated model and a quantum tunneling contribution\n\u22121\nrepresented by a temperature-independent residence time \u03c4QT , \u03c4S\u22121 = \u03c4QT\n+ \u03c4R\u22121 exp(\u2212\u2206E/kB T )\n\nis shown by the red solid line in Fig. 4 for \u03c4QT =5,000 s and \u03c4R =15 s (confidence limits obtained\nfrom the fits are \u03c4QT =5,000\u00b11,000 s and tR =4-60 s). The short-term fluctuation rate \u03c4F\u22121 observed\nin the autocorrelation data in Fig. 3a has the same magnitude as the attempt frequency \u03c4R\u22121 . In\nanalogy with alpha and beta relaxation observed in glasses, supercooled liquids and jammed soft\n6\n\n\fmatter systems, faster fluctuations represent local relaxation, while slower fluctuations are due to\ncollective relaxation modes.\n\nThe relaxation times observed here are similar to those associated with magnetization switching in ferromagnets first observed by Barkhausen [1] and studied since then in systems from bulk\nmaterials to magnetic molecules [5, 19-22]. Antiferromagnets have more complex order than ferromagnets because they break translation as well as spin rotation invariance, which has forced\nus to formulate a very crude physical picture, to understand our data at a semi quantitative level.\nWe start with the realization that to minimize the very large exchange energy (>0.4 eV) [23, 24]\nassociated with domain walls, it is clearly advantageous for the nodal planes (where the spin polarization vanishes) of the SDW with its propagation vector perpendicular to the domain wall to\nlie on the walls [25]. Such an assumption is further supported by the previously observed preference for the formation of SDW nodes at Fe/Cr interfaces [26]. This implies that the fundamental\nswitching unit (grey shaded region in Fig. 1a) is of volume VS \u223c (\u03bb/2)3 where \u03bb is the underlying\nperiod of the SDW. In the simplest Gaussian model where underlying units are switching randomly\nat typical times \u03c4U , we would conclude that the switching time for a volume of V=1 \u03bcm3 would\nbe (V/VS )2 \u03c4U . Using our experimental value for the attempt frequency \u03c4R\u22121 , we therefore obtain\n\u03c4U\u22121 = 36 THz=140 meV as the attempt frequency for rotating an entire unit. This is an electronic\nenergy scale, and could therefore be derived from the hopping of electrons across the domain wall;\nsuch electrons (also important in electrical noise measurements [8]) are, after all, responsible for\nthe current fluctuations which sample the possibility of rotating the Fermi surface of a 'quantum\ndot' with the fundamental unit volume VS . It is fortunate that the barrier for rotation between\n7\n\n\ftwo minima has been identified by neutron spectroscopy on Cr0.95 V0.05 (data for pure Cr are not\npublished) (See Fig. 2 of Ref. 27) as the energy Eo at which the incommensurate spin density\nfluctuations no longer display distinct peaks at the incommensurate satellite positions; Eo is found\nto be of order 25 meV (or 290 K), which is not far from the tunnelling barrier \u2206E=20 meV (or\n240 K) established in our own experiments. Interestingly, it is this energy, rather than the much\nlarger exchange coupling, which corresponds to TN .\n\nIn the simplest WKB approximation (see e.g. Ref. 22), the dimensionless ratio \u03c4R /\u03c4QT is\nequal to exp(\u2212S/h\u0304), where S =\n\n\u221a\n\nI\u2206E is the tunneling action. Because the underlying attempt\n\nfrequencies and their rescaling to account for observable effects in the X-ray experiment are the\nsame for both incoherent quantum and classical processes, all of the detail \u2013 invoking multiple\nrotors - of the last paragraph drops out, and S characterizes a single rotor. We can therefore\ncalculate the moment of inertia I of the quantum rotor using the measured parameters \u03c4QT , \u03c4R and\nthe barrier height \u2206E=20 meV obtained from the Arrhenius regime. The result is I=100 me nm2 ,\nwhich, assuming a cube of uniform density distributed over the (\u03bb/2)3 volume of the fundamental\nunit corresponds to 0.1 electron mass me per Chromium unit cell. This remarkable result, derived\nonly from our data and the simple physical picture of Fig. 1, is consistent with Hall effect data\n[28, 29] showing that the SDW is associated with the loss of a similar number of carriers, which\nof course must be moved with the rotors when there is a switching event.\n\nWe have introduced the direct measurement of noise spectra in antiferromagnets. Our experiments access local mesoscale spin dynamics with just a few domain walls in the illuminated\n\n8\n\n\fvolume, an advantage over non-local experimental probes that cannot be easily applied for macroscopic or bulk structures. The key finding is that even in bulk samples, and at temperatures very\nlow compared to the Neel temperature, domain walls can be unstable on time scales of fractions\nof an hour. What this means is that the stability of antiferromagnetism needs to engineered, e.g.\nby insertion of appropriate pinning centres, into devices that exploit it. This will become even\nmore important for nanoscale spintronics including antiferromagnetic elements. Beyond the obvious advantages for magnetic engineering of now having a technique with which antiferromagnetic\ndomain fluctuations can be readily assessed, we foresee tremendous opportunities in areas such as\nthe science of antiferromagnetic nanoparticles.\n\nMethods. Experiments were carried out at beamlines 33-ID and 8-ID of Advanced Photon\nSource, Argonne National Laboratory. The undulator-generated x rays are monochromatized by\na Si (111) crystal at an energy E=7.35 keV (wavelength 1.686 Angstroms). A 10 \u03bcm pinhole\naperture or a 10g\u03bcm (horizontally) by 40 \u03bcm (vertically) slits placed 5 cm upstream from the\nsample selected partially coherent portion of the x-ray beam with a resulting coherence fraction\nA\u22480.07-0.18. A high purity (111) Cr wafer (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) was used to ensure\nroughly equal population of domains. The sample was mounted inside a low-drift He flow cryostat,\nwith thermal shielding provided by 600 \u03bcm thick Be dome. Speckle patterns were recorded with\na Princeton Instruments PI-LCX 1300 deep depletion x-ray CCD camera (1340x1300 pixel array\nwith 20 micron by 20 micron pixel size), located 150 cm from the sample in reflection geometry.\n\nReferences.\n\n9\n\n\f[1] Barkhausen, H.
