Recently there has been an increasing interest on long-range interacting systems [1]. The first reason\nis the broad spectrum of applications: self-gravitating\nand Coulomb systems, vortices in two-dimensional fluid\nmechanics [2], wave-particles interaction and trapped\ncharged particles [3]. Second, unexpected non gaussian\ndistributions [4] and non exponential relaxations for autocorrelations [4, 5, 7] have recently been observed in\nsuch systems. This was a great surprise, indeed, at variance with short-range interacting systems, as all the particles contribute to the local field, mean-field predictions\nare usually extremely good and often exact for the corresponding equilibrium statistical mechanics. In accordance with this simple picture, usual expectations were\nthat these systems should exhibit gaussian distribution\nfunctions and normal exponential relaxations.\nThe recent discovery of non gaussian distributions [4]\nled to an intense and productive debate on the applicability [8] of usual Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics to\nlong-range interacting systems (see Tsallis et al in Ref. 1).\nSuch non Gaussian distributions have been fitted using\nTsallis' distributions [4]. The striking asymptotic algebraic behaviors for momentum autocorrelations have also\nbeen fitted using q-exponential functions [4, 5], derived\nfrom non extensive statistical mechanics.\nIn this paper, revisiting this question, we present for\nthe first time analytical results explaining these numerical findings, without using concepts of non-extensive statistical mechanics. In a recent paper [16], we explained\nthe ubiquitous occurrence of non equilibrium distributions by linking them with stable Vlasov solutions. Here,\nwe complete this argument by explaining that the time\nscale for the evolution of such non Gaussian distributions\nhas to be larger than the number of particles N . In an\nother recent paper, we have derived the Fokker Planck\n\nequation describing a single particle in an equilibrium\nbath [9]. Here we generalize this result to out of equilibrium bath distributions. More importantly, we also\nreport analytical explicit predictions for the momentum\nautocorrelations at large time, explaining its algebraic relaxation. Finally, anomalous diffusion phenomena in the\nasymptotic time limit were found in these systems and\nalso highly debated [6, 7]. This concept, raised in a great\nvariety of different fields such as geophysics, chemical engineering and disordered media, was analytically understood in only very few many-degrees-of-freedom systems,\neven if the question of L\u00e9vy flights is very popular nowadays. Starting from the microscopic dynamics of a longrange interacting system, we present in this letter, analytical predictions showing that there exists a full class\nof distributions which leads to anomalous diffusion. We\ngive an explicit prediction of the anomalous diffusion exponent in terms of the bath distribution function. We inssit that such an exact prediction of this exponent, from\nthe microscopic dynamics of a Hamiltonian N particle\nsystem is not common at all.\nIn this letter, we consider these questions for the\nHamiltonian Mean-Field model [10]\nHN =\n\nN\nN\n1 X\n1X 2\npj \u2212\ncos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ),\n2 j=1\n2N i,j=1\n\n(1)\n\nsince it is nowadays thought to be the simplest model to\nstudy dynamical and thermodynamic properties of system with long-range interactions [1]. In addition to its\npedagogical properties, it corresponds to a simplification\nof one-dimensional gravitational interactions and is an\nexcellent first step before the Colson-Bonifacio's model\nfor free-electron Lasers [11]. Note that the factor 1/N is\nthe appropriate and classical mean field scaling, relevant\nfor long-range interacting systems [12, 13]: indeed, the\nphysically interesting limit for such systems amounts to\nlet the number of particles go to infinity at fixed volume,\nby contrast with the usual thermodynamic limit.\n\n\f2\nLet us consider the kinetics of the HMF model using the Klimontovich approach. We have checked that\nan asymptotical expansion of the BBGKY hierarchy\nleads to the same results. The state of the N -particles\nsystem can thus be described by the discrete single\nparticle time-dependent density function fd (t, \u03b8, p) =\nPN\n1\nj=1 \u03b4 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8j (t)) \u03b4 (p \u2212 pj (t)) , where \u03b4 is the Dirac\nN\nfunction, (\u03b8, p) the Eulerian coordinates of the phase\nspace and (\u03b8i , pi ) the Lagrangian coordinates of the particles. The dynamics is thus described by the Klimontovich's equation [15]\n\u2202fd dV \u2202fd\n\u2202fd\n+p\n\u2212\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\nd\u03b8 \u2202p\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the potential V that affects all particles is V (t, \u03b8) \u2261\nR 2\u03c0 R +\u221e\n\u2212 0 d\u03b1 \u2212\u221e dp cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1) fd (t, \u03b1, p). This description of\nthe Hamiltonian dynamics derived from (1) is exact: as\nthe distribution is a sum of Dirac functions it contains the\ninformation on the position and velocity of all particles.\nIt is however too precise for usual physical quantities of\ninterest but will be a key starting point for the derivation\nof approximate equations, valid in the limit N large and\ndescribing average quantities.\nWhen N is large, it is natural to approximate the discrete density fd by a continuous one f (t, \u03b8, p). Considering an ensemble of microscopic initial conditions\nclose to the same initial macroscopic state, one defines\nthe statistical average hfd i = f0 (\u03b8, p), whereas\u221afluctuations of probabilistic properties are of order 1/ N . We\nwill assume that f0 is any stable stationary solution\nof the Vlasov equation. The discrete time-dependent\ndensity function can\u221athus be rewritten as fd (t, \u03b8, p) =\nf0 (\u03b8, p) + \u03b4f (t, \u03b8, p)/ N , where the fluctuation \u03b4f is of\nzero average. We define similarly the averaged potential\nhV i and its corresponding\n\u221a fluctuations \u03b4V (t, \u03b8) so that\nV (t, \u03b8) = hV i + \u03b4V (t, \u03b8)/ N . Inserting both expressions\nin Klimontovich's equation (2) and taking the average,\none obtains\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202f0\ndhV i \u2202f0\n1 d\u03b4V \u2202\u03b4f\n\u2202f0\n. (3)\n+p\n\u2212\n=\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\nd\u03b8 \u2202p\nN\nd\u03b8 \u2202p\nThe lhs is the Vlasov equation. The exact kinetic equation (3) suggests that for times much smaller than N ,\nand stationary stable solutions f0 for the Vlasov equation, the rhs term, corresponding to the fluctuation of\nthe mean-field potential, can be neglected. This is confirmed, for any finite time, by the Braun and Hepp theorem [13, 14]. The innumerable Vlasov stable stationary\nstates, far from equilibrium [16] (see [17] for a first stability analysis), then explains the generic occurrence of\nout-of-equilibrium distributions. These quasistationary\nstates do not evolve on time scales much smaller than N ,\nexplaining the extremely slow relaxation of the system\ntoward the statistical equilibrium.\nLet us now concentrate on stable homogenous distributions f0 (p), which are stationary since hV i = 0. Sub-\n\n\u221a\ntracting Eq. (3) from Eq. (2) and using fd = f0 +\u03b4f / N ,\none gets\n\u001c\n\u001d\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202\u03b4f\nd\u03b4V \u2202f0\n1 d\u03b4V \u2202\u03b4f\n\u2202\u03b4f\n+p\n\u2212\n= \u221a\n\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\nd\u03b8 \u2202p\nN d\u03b8 \u2202p\n\nd\u03b4V \u2202\u03b4f\nd\u03b8 \u2202p\n\n.\n\n\u221a\nFor times much shorter than N , we may drop the rhs\nencompassing quadratic terms in the fluctuations. The\nfluctuating part \u03b4f are then described, by the linearized\nVlasov equation (this is an other result of the Braun and\nHepp theorem [13, 14]). This suggest to introduce the\nspatio-temporal Fourier-Laplace transform of \u03b4f and \u03b4V .\nThis leads to\nZ\nf (0, k, p)\n\u03c0 (\u03b4k,1 + \u03b4k,\u22121 ) +\u221e \u03b4f\nf\n, (4)\ndp\n\u03b4V (\u03c9, k) = \u2212\n\u03b5(\u03c9, k)\ni(pk \u2212 \u03c9)\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere\n\n\u03b5(\u03c9, k) = 1 + \u03c0k (\u03b4k,1 + \u03b4k,\u22121 )\n\nZ\n\n\u2202f0\n\u2202p\ndp\n(pk \u2212 \u03c9)\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(5)\n\nis the dielectric permittivity. The evolution of the potential autocorrelation, can therefore be determined. For hof (\u03c91 , k1 )\u03b4V\nf (\u03c92 , k2 )i =\nmogeneous states, by symetry, h\u03b4V\n0 except if k1 = \u2212k2 = \u00b11. One gets, after a transitory\nexponential decay, the general result\nZ\nf0 (\u03c9)\n\u03c0\nd\u03c9 e\u2212i\u03c9(t1 \u2212t2 )\nh\u03b4V (t1 , \u00b11)\u03b4V (t2 , \u22131)i =\n.\n2 C\n|\u03b5(\u03c9, 1)|2\n(6)\nThis is an exact result, no approximation has yet been\ndone.\nA similar, although longer, calculation shows that the\nrhs of Eq. (3) identically vanishes at order 1/N . This\nproves that Vlasov stable distribution function will not\nevolve on time scales smaller or equal to N , in agreement with the N 1.7 scaling law which was numerically\nreported [16, 18]. This is the first important result:\ngeneric out of equilibrium distributions evolve on time\nscales much larger than N .\nLet us now consider relaxation properties of a testparticle, indexed by 1, surrounded by a background system of (N \u22121) particles with a homogeneous distribution.\nThe fluctuation of the potential is thus\nZ 2\u03c0 Z +\u221e\n1\n\u03b4V (t, \u03b8) \u2261 \u2212 d\u03b1 dp cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03b1) \u03b4f (t, \u03b1, p)\u2212 \u221a cos (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b81 ) .\nN\n\u2212\u221e\n0\n(7)\nUsing the equations of motion of the test particle and\nomitting the index 1 Rfor the sake of simplicity,\u221a one obt\ntains p(t) = p(0) \u2212 0du(d\u03b4V (u, \u03b8(u)))/(d\u03b8)/ N . By\nintroducing iteratively the expression of \u03b8 in the rhs and\nexpanding the derivative of the potential, one gets the\nresult at order 1/N . The key point is that this approach\ndoes not use the usual ballistic approximation. As a consequence, we obtain an exact result at order 1/N . This\n\n\f3\nis of paramount importance here to treat accurately the\ncollective effects. \u221aAs the changes in the impulsion are\nsmall (of order 1/ N ), the description of the impulsion\nstochastic process by a Fokker-Planck equation is valid.\nThis last equation is then characterized by the time ben\nhavior of the first two moments h(p(t) \u2212 p(0)) i. Using\nthe generalization of formula (6) when the effect of the\ntest particle is taken into account, one obtains in the\nlarge t-limit\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndD\n1 \u2202f0\nt\u2192+\u221e t\n(p) +\nD(p) (8)\nh(p(t) \u2212 p(0))i \u223c\nN dp\nf0 \u2202p\n2 t\u2192+\u221e 2t\nh(p(t) \u2212 p(0)) i \u223c\nD(p),\n(9)\nN\nwhere the diffusion coefficient D(p) can be written as\nZ +\u221e\n2\nD(p) = 2 Re\n\n0\n\ndt eipt h\u03b4V (t, 1)\u03b4V (0, \u22121)i =\n\n\u03c0 f0 (p)\n.\n|\u03b5(p, 1)|2\n(10)\n\nThese results are the exact leading order terms in an expansion where 1/N is the small parameter. We obtained\npreviously equivalent results, but restricted to equilibrium (gaussian) f0 [9], by a rather different and instructive approach. In this last paper, a comparison of the\ndiffusion coefficient D(p) with N particle numerical simulations is presented, illustrating that both results are\nundistinguishable. Let us carry on by explicitly evaluating the diffusion coefficient for a homogenous\nGausp\n2\nsian distribution function fg (\u03b8, p) = \u03b2/(2\u03c0)3 e\u2212\u03b2p /2 .\nIn that case, after straightforward calculations, one gets\nthe expression derived in [9]. The diffusion\ncoefficient\np\n\u2212\u03b2p2 /2\nD(p) has the asymptotic expression \u03c0\u03b2/2 e\nfor\nlarge p values (see Fig. 1).\nInterestingly, the method presented here, can be used\nfor any Vlasov-stable out-of-equilibrium distributions.\nFor instance, in Fig. 1, we present the result for the waterbag distribution.\nUsing time variable \u03c4 = t/N as suggested by Eqs. (8)\nand (9), the Fokker-Planck equation describing the time\nevolution of the distribution of the test particle is\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u2202f1 (\u03c4, p)\n\u2202f1 (\u03c4, p)\n\u2202\n1 \u2202f0\nD(p)\n=\n\u2212\nf1 (\u03c4, p) .\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\nf0 \u2202p\n(11)\nWe stress that this equation depends on the bath distribution f0 . It is valid both for equilibrium and out-ofequilibrium f0 , provided that f0 is a stable stationary solution of the Vlasov equation. In the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e (more\nprecisely 1 \u226a \u03c4 \u226a N ), the bracket vanishes: the pdf f1\nof the test particle converges toward the quasi-stationary\ndistribution f0 of the surrounding bath. This is in complete agreement with the result that f0 is stationary for\ntimes scales of order N .\nFor a large class of quasi-stationary distributions f0 ,\nusing Eq. (11), we can compute the momenta autocorrelation hp(\u03c4 )p(0)i, fitted numerically [5, 7, 18] with power\n\nFIG. 1: Diffusion coefficient D(p) in the case HN /N = 2\nfor a Boltzmann thermal bath (solid line) and a waterbag\ndistribution (dashed line).\n\nFIG. 2: The solid line represents the time evolution of the\nmomentum autocorrelations obtained using the numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck equation for a test particle in\na surrounding gaussian reservoir (\u03b2 = 0.25).

The second important result of this letter is that the time dependence of the momentum autocorrelation function scale\nwith N as hp(t)p(0)i = C(t/N ) where C(.) is a function.\nLet us first present the particular but very important\ncase of a test particle in contact with a gaussian distribution f0 (equilibrium bath). Fig. 2 shows the momenta\nautocorrelation hp(\u03c4 )p(0)i, numerically computed from\nthe Fokker-Planck Eq. (11); it presents an unexpected\nvery slow relaxation which can, numerically, hardly be\ndistinguished from a 1/\u03c4 -law. As shown below, the very\nfast decrease of the diffusion coefficient shown in Fig. 1\nis actually the key point in these interesting and unusual\nproperties of the momenta autocorrelation.\nOne derive analytically the large time behavior of the\n\n\f4\nautocorrelation function, for any Vlasov stable distribution f0 , using an asymptotic expansion inspired by [19]\n(see also [20]). By introducing the appropriate\np change\nof variable x = x(p), defined by dx/dp = 1/ D(p), one\nends up with the constant diffusion coefficient FokkerPlanck equation\n!\n\u2202 fb1 (\u03c4, x) \u2202\u03c8 b\n\u2202\n\u2202 fb1 (\u03c4, x)\nf1 (\u03c4, x) ,\n(12)\n=\n+\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nwhere \u03c8(x) = \u2212 ln\n\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n|p|\u2192\u221e\nD(p)f0 (p) . Using \u03b5(p, 1) \u223c 1,\n|p|\u2192\u221e\n\nEq. (10) shows that D(p) \u223c \u03c0 2 f0 (p).\nLet us first consider distribution functions so that\n|p|\u2192\u221e\nf0 (p) \u223c C exp(\u2212\u03b3p\u03b4 ), which includes not only the\ngaussian (\u03b4 = 2) and exponential tails (\u03b4 = 1), but also\nstretched-exponential ones with \u03b4 > 0. Asymptotic analysis leads to p(x)\n\u03c8(x)\n\n|x|\u2192\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\nx\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\n2/\u03b3 (ln(x))\n\n\u03b1 ln |x|,\n\n1/\u03b4\n\nwhereas\n\nwith \u03b1 = 3.\n\n(13)\n\nInterestingly, this log-potential is a limiting case between\na pure diffusive process leading to self-similar solutions\nand exponentially decreasing fb1 -solutions in a strongly\nconfining potential. Asymptotic behavior (13) is still\nvalid for distribution functions with algebraic tails, i.e.\nf0 (p)\n\n|p|\u2192\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\nCp\u2212\u03bd where \u03bd > 3. However, \u03b1 = 3\u03bd/(2 + \u03bd)\n\n|x|\u2192\u221e\n\nand p(x) \u223c C \u2032 x2/(2+\u03bd) .\nBy considering the ansatz fb1 (x, t) = \u03c6\u03bb (x)e\u2212\u03bb\u03c4 , one\ngets that the spectrum of the Fokker-Planck operator\ncorresponds to only one bound state fb10 (x) = f0 , normalizable for \u03b1 > 1, with an associated eigenvalue located at\nthe bottom of the continuum: the absence of gap forbids\na priori any exponential relaxation.\nAs we are interested in the asymptotic large-\u03c4 limit,\nwe will restrict the analysis to the small-\u03bb regime. A\nmatched asymptotic procedure in the two distinct regions, |x| > l and |x| < l, solves\n\u221a the equation. In the\nfirst domain, introducing z = \u03bb x and g\u03bb (z) = z\u03c6\u03bb ,\nand using the asymptotic result (13), one ends up with\n\u2032\u2032\nz 2 g\u03bb + g\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b1 \u2212 2)z + g\u03bb (2 \u2212 2\u03b1 + z 2 ) = 0. The solutions can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions of order \u03bd, J\u03bd and Y\u03bd , as g\u03bb (z) = A\u03bb,l z (3\u2212\u03b1)/2 J(\u03b1+1)/2 (z) +\nB\u03bb,l z (3\u2212\u03b1)/2 Y(\u03b1+1)/2 (z). In the domain |x| < l, where\none neglects the term proportional to the vanishing\neigenvalue R\u03bb, the solution is \u03c6\u03bb (x) = D\u03bb,l e\u2212\u03c8(x) +\nx\nC\u03bb,l e\u2212\u03c8(x) 0 du e\u03c8(x) . In order to compute the momenta autocorrelation function, noting that p(x) is an\nodd function of x, we focus on odd eigenstates, obtained\nby considering D\u03bb,l = 0. By taking care of the matching condition in x = l and of the normalization con\u03bb\u21920 \u221a\n\u03bb/2,\ndition, one ends up with the scaling: A\u03bb,l \u223c\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nB\u03bb,l \u223c \u03bb/4 and C\u03bb,l \u223c C(l)\u03bb(5/2) .\nAll these results are finally useful to derive the momentum auto-correlation. Indeed using as initial con-\n\nR +\u221e\ndition fb1 (x, 0) \u2261 N (l)p(x)e\u2212\u03c8(x) = 0 d\u03bb \u03bc(\u03bb)\u03c6\u03bb (x)\nwhere N (l) isR the ground state normalisation factor and\n\u03bc(\u03bb) = N (l) dx p(x)\u03c6\u03bb (x), one gets\nZ +\u221e\n1\nhp(\u03c4 )p(0)i =\nd\u03bb \u03bc(\u03bb)2 e\u2212\u03bb\u03c4 .\n(14)\nN (l) 0\nIts limiting behavior in the \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e limit will be given by\nthe behavior of \u03bc(\u03bb) when \u03bb \u2192 0, which is itself determined by the large |x| behavior of p(x).\nLet us be more specific in several important cases. The\nchoice p(x) \u221d (ln x)1/\u03b4 which corresponds to distribution functions with gaussian, exponential or stretchedexponential tails, leads to the important result\n(ln \u03c4 )2/\u03b4\n,\n(15)\n\u03c4\nindependent on \u03b1. This very slow algebraic relaxation,\nwith logarithmic corrections, agrees with numerical simulation shown in Fig. 2, for the Gaussian case \u03b4 = 2.\nAn extension of this approach to distribution function\nf0 (p) with algebraic tails is of prime interest. Following\nthe same steps in the case p(x) = x\u03b7 (\u03b7 < (\u03b1 \u2212 1)/2)\nhp(\u03c4 )p(0)i\n\n\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\n\n\u221d\n\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nleads to \u03bc(\u03bb) \u221d \u03bb(\u03b1\u22122\u03b7\u22123)/4 and to the limiting be\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\n\nhavior hx\u03b7 (\u03c4 )x\u03b7 (0)i \u221d \u03c4 \u03b7\u2212(\u03b1\u22121)/2 . Applying this result to the algebraic decay of the distribution function\n|p|\u2192\u221e\n\nf0 (p) \u223c Cp\u2212\u03bd , with \u03bd > 2 and using the corresponding asymptotic expression for p(x), discussed above, we\nget \u03b7 = 2/(2 + \u03bd) and \u03b1 = 3\u03bd/(2 + \u03bd). We thus obtain\nthe algebraic decay\nhp(\u03c4 )p(0)i\n\n\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\n\n\u221d\n\n\u03bd\u22123\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 2+\u03bd .\n\n(16)\n\nThis is the third important result: the equilibrium distribution and generic out of equilibrium distributions lead\nto algebraic large time behaviors of the momentum autocorrelation functions.\nFinally, from the momenta correlations, one usually derives the angle diffusion h(\u03b8(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b8(0))2 i = 2D\u03b8 \u03c4 where\nR +\u221e\nD\u03b8 is defined via Kubo formula D\u03b8 = 0 d\u03c4 hp(\u03c4 )p(0)i.\nHowever, asymptotic result (15) shows that this integral diverges leading to small anomalous diffusion for\nstretched exponential bath distributions. By contrast,\nfor distributions with algebraic tails, since the exponent\n(\u03bd \u2212 3)/(2 + \u03bd) in Eq. (16) is smaller than one, we predict\nstrong anomalous diffusion. This is the fourth important\nresult.\nIn summary, this work confirms and explains the unexpected kinetic behavior of long-range interacting systems: ubiquity of non gaussian distribution and algebraic\nbehavior for momenta autocorrelation functions. Using\ntraditional kinetic theory, we also predict strong anomalous diffusion for angles for a large class of initial distributions. Finally, let us anticipate that several physical\nsystems with long-range interactions should exhibit similar features. One would in particular quote dynamics of\nvortices [21] and cold atoms physics [22].\n\n\f5\nWe thank J. Barr\u00e9, P-H. Chavanis, I. Kourakis, S. Miccich\u00e8, S. Ruffo and C.
