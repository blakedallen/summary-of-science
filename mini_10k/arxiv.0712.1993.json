The strong role of the \u03b7 nucleus final state interaction (FSI) near\nthreshold was established first in [4] where the FSI was incorporated through an enhancement\nfactor. Later on, using few body equations within the finite rank approximation to describe\nthe \u03b7 - 3 He elastic scattering, a good agreement with the threshold data was found in [5]\nusing a three body reaction mechanism. However, this two-step model, where the \u03b7 meson\nis produced via the pp \u2192 \u03c0d and \u03c0N \u2192 \u03b7N reactions could not reproduce the forward\npeaked angular distributions at high energies [6]. In [6], it was also shown that the claim\nin [7], that the two-step model is successful in reproducing the angular distributions as well\nas the total cross sections at high energies was based on ad hoc assumptions related to the\nintermediate off-shell pion. Besides, the author in [7] included the FSI in an approximate\nway. The purpose of this note is to point out the erroneous conclusions reached in [Phys\nRev. C 75, 014004 (2007)] (henceforth referred to as [8]) based on comparisons with the two\nstep model of [7] as well as present and discuss the results on the role of the higher partial\nwaves in the \u03c0N \u2192 \u03b7N scattering, which is an input for these calculations. Finally, we also\ncompare our theoretical \u03b7 3 He scattering length with the one deduced by the authors of [8].\nIn Fig. 1, we compare the data on the total cross sections for the pd \u2192 3 He \u03b7 reaction\nwith our results obtained using the two-step model for the production mechanism [5, 6]. This\ncalculation incorporates an integral over all momenta of the intermediate off-shell particles in\nthe two-step model, and includes the \u03b7 3 He FSI through a solution of the few body equations\nin the FRA. The results are shown for the FSI calculated with two different parameter\nsets for the \u03b7N \u2192 \u03b7N scattering, corresponding to scattering lengths (0.75,0.27)fm and\n(0.88,0.41)fm. This model reproduces the data of Mayer et al. [1] as well as that of the\nCOSY-ANKE experiment [9] at very low energies, close to threshold. The model is however\nunable to reproduce the data away from threshold in Fig. 1.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the predictions of this model for the angular distributions calculated\nwith the s-wave alone and with higher partial waves for the intermediate \u03c0N \u2192 \u03b7N process.\nThe theoretical angular distribution at threshold (Tp = 891 MeV) is isotropic (see Fig. 4\nin [5]). However, the present two step model soon leads to a backward peaked cross section\nalready at an excess energy of Q = 5 MeV. The forward peaked distributions at high energies\ncannot be reproduced even after the inclusion of the higher partial waves. The shifting of\nthe peak to the forward hemisphere with energy, as shown in [6], can arise if we restrict the\n2\n\n\fpropagation of the intermediate pion to small angles (less than 10 deg). Such a constraint\nis, however, ad hoc and unjustified. Besides, the magnitude of the cross section gets highly\nunderestimated in such a situation as can be seen in Fig. 4 of [6].\n700\n600\n\n\u03c3 (nb)\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n~~\n\n100\n5\n\n10\n20\n40\nExcess energy Q (MeV)\n\n80\n\nWASA\n\n1500\n\nCOSY-ANKE\nCOSY-11\nMayer et al.\n\n1000\n\n2\n\n|f| (nb/sr)\n\n60\n\n(theory) a\u03b7N = (0.88,0.41) fm\n\n500\n\n(theory) a\u03b7N = (0.75,0.27) fm\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-1\n\np (fm )\nFIG. 1: Comparison of the data on the pd \u2192 3 He \u03b7 reaction with a two step model calculation\nincluding the \u03b7 3 He final state interaction in the s-wave and s, p and d partial waves in the reaction\nmechanism.

Hence any conclusions in [8] about the success of the two-step model, based\non a comparison with the theoretical work in [7] should be taken with caution.\n\n[1] B. Mayer et al., Phys. Rev.
