In fact, the moving\ntip can be regarded as a single asperity which determines\nthe frictional force between macroscopic surfaces1 . Under\na constant load, the low-velocity motion of the tip on a\nsurface exhibits stick-slip behavior as the moving tip hops\nover the corrugation potential defined by the substrate.\nFor a quantitative description of friction at the microscopic level, theoretical understanding of the behavior of\nthe tip on the substrate under different conditions is required. Recent studies have argued that due to thermal\nfluctuations, the lateral frictional force increases logarithmically with increasing sliding velocity2\u20134 . However, it is\nalso found experimentally that the frictional force can\nhave an opposite behavior, where it decreases with the\nsliding velocity depending on the ambient conditions5\nand the nature of the substrate6 . The origin of this\ndecreasing velocity dependence is not fully understood\nand it is possible that distinct effects need to be taken\ninto account to explain different experimental conditions.\nCurrent explanations of this behavior for point contact\nfriction are based on extensions of the simplest effective model, the generalized Tomlinson model3,8,9 , taking\ninto account additional effects such as dissipation due\nto deformation of the AFM tip7 or the inclusion of additional time scales for reorganization of the surface during\nsliding6 . In particular, the interpretation of recent experiments on surfaces covered with a monolayer in terms of\nan additional time scale due to surface restructuring6 still\nlacks detailed theoretical support.\nIn this work, we study the velocity dependence of the\nfrictional force within a simple theoretical model taking\ninto account the coupling of the AFM tip to excitation\nmodes of the surface in addition to the coupling to the pe-\n\nriodic corrugation potential. We model the generic excitation modes by damped harmonic oscillators analogous\nto the model of an adsorbate coupled to phonon modes of\nthe substrate10 . We find that when the excitation mode\nfrequency is comparable to the characteristic frequency\nof the particle moving across the surface potential, the\nvelocity dependence of the frictional force is non monotonic displaying a velocity range where the frictional force\ncan decrease with increasing velocity. These results provide theoretical support within a simpler model for the\ninterpretation of recent experiments6 which find a frictional force that decreases with velocity on surfaces covered with a monolayer.\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nThe lateral motion of the tip can be described by a\nmodel of a single particle in an external one-dimensional\npotential representing the substrate and coupled elastically to the moving support. The equation of motion for\nthe particle is given by3\ndV (R, x)\n\u2212 m\u03b3 \u1e8b + f (t)\ndx\nwhere the noise variables f (t) satisfy\nm\u1e8d = \u2212\n\n(1)\n\n< f (t)f (t\u2032 ) >= 2m\u03b3kB T \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n(2)\n\nand V (R, x) = Vp (x) + Vs (x, R) is the total potential\nincluding the interaction of the tip to the substrate with\nperiodic potential\nx\nVp (x) = Vo [1 \u2212 cos(2\u03c0 )]\n(3)\na\nand the elastic interaction between the tip and the moving support\n1\n(4)\nVs (x, R) = k(x \u2212 R(t))2\n2\n\n\f2\nwhere R(t) is the position of the support.\nThe friction damping parameter \u03b3 in Eq. (1) results\nfrom the coupling of the tip to the surface excitations\nwith a much shorter time scale than the motion of the tip\n(e.g. electronic excitations) which results in a \u03b4-function\ncorrelated random force f (t) with instantaneous Markovian damping without memory as described by Eq. (2).\nThe microscope support is moving at constant velocity,\nR(t) = vt, where v is the support velocity. The average\nforce on the support due to the tip motion is then given\nby\n\nso that the total effect of a finite number of damped oscillators corresponds to a continum distribution10 of excitation modes with a density of states \u03c1(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 2 , analogous\nto that for 3-D phonons in the Debye model. The equations of motion for the tip and the mode displacement\nvariables can be written in a dimensionless form as\nX\n\u1e8d = \u22122\u03c0sin(2\u03c0x) + k(R(t) \u2212 x) \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1o\n\u03c9\u03bb f\u03bb (x)u\u03bb\n\nF = k < R(t) \u2212 x >\n\nwhere the additional noise variables r\u03bb for the damped\nharmonic oscillator also satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation\n\n(5)\n\nThis is regarded as the frictional force with the substrate\nsince without damping we should have F = 0 when averaging out the negative and positive force region of the\nperiodic potential. For sufficiently large frictional damping stick and slip motion is expected. As shown in Ref.\n3, using this model the frictional force F increases with\nincreasing velocity v. At small v, it increases logarithmically but ultimately one would expect F to be just \u03b3v,\nfor sufficiently large v.\nWe extend the model described by Eq. (1) by allowing\nthe tip to couple to other excitations in the substrate\nwhich have a finite time scale. These other excitations are\nmodeled by damped simple harmonic oscillators as done\nin Ref. 10 . These excitations can be labeled by the mode\nindex \u03bb = (i, l) where i = 1, 2 labels the symmetry group\nand l runs from 1 to N/2 where N is the total number\nof modes. Each mode is characterized by a displacement\nvariable u\u03bb , which couples to the tip motion. The total\nHamiltonian can be written as\nX M \u03c92\np2\n\u03bb\n+ V (x, R) \u2212\nW\u03bb2 (x)\n2m\n2\n\u03bb\nX p2\nM \u03c9\u03bb2\n\u03bb\n+\n[\n+\n(u\u03bb + W\u03bb (x))2 ]\n2M\n2\n\nH =\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bb\n\nThe third term in the above Hamiltonian represents\na counterbalance term. This is added so that when the\ntip moves very slowly relative to all the time scales given\nby 2\u03c0/\u03c9\u03bb , then at any instantaneous position of x, u\u03bb =\n\u2212W\u03bb and the actual effective potential felt by the tip\nP M\u03c9\u03bb2 2\nis Vp (x) \u2212\n2 W\u03bb which is the adiabatic potential.\nHowever, when the tip is moving very fast relative to such\ntime scales, then the substrate has no time to respond,\nand one recovers the rigid substrate potential Vp (x). The\nexplicit form of W\u03bb (x) is chosen as\n2\u03c0\u03b1Vo\nq\nsin(2\u03c0x/a)\na N2 M \u03c9l2\n2\u03c0\u03b1Vo\ncos(2\u03c0x/a)\n= q\na N2 M \u03c9l2\n\nWl,l =\nW2,1\n\n(7)\n\nThe coupling \u03b1 in Eq.

In Eq.

The parameters for the spring and microscopic damping were fixed to k = 3 and \u03b3 = 6 and for\ndamped harmonic oscillators, \u03b3\u03bb = 2w\u03bb and \u03b1o = 2.5.\nTime steps ranged from dt = 0.001 to 0.005. Numerical results for the velocity dependence of the friction\nforce obtained from Eq. (5) assuming different angular\nfrequencies \u03c9 for coupling to one odd or even mode are\nshown in Figs 1 and 2. They are qualitative similar and\nshow that when the frequency of the excitation mode is\nsufficiently small the velocity dependence of the friction\nforce is non monotonic. While at sufficiently small or\nlarge velocities it increases with velocity there is an intermediate range of velocities where the frictional force\ndecreases as the velocity increases. The approximate linear decrease in the semilog plot of Figs 1 and 2, suggest\nthat this decrease is logarithmic.\nTo understand this non monotonic behavior it should\nbe noted that there are several important time scales in\nthe problem. First, there is a velocity dependent time\nscale, tv = a/v, which is the average time for the tip to\ntraverse one lattice period of pinning potential.pThe pinning potential introduces a time scale, t0 = ma2 /Vo ,\nthe vibrational period of the tip in the well. In the stick\nand slip regime where the tip is stuck in the well and\nperform many vibrational oscillations before hopping to\nthe next minima, we have tv >> t0 . The time for crossing the barrier is relatively fast, on the order of t0 . With\nthe coupling to a new excitation mode of frequency \u03c9l ,\nanother time scale tl = 2\u03c0/\u03c9l is introduced. We now\nconsider what is the effect of varying tv = a/v on the\n\n\f3\n\n40\n40\n\n\u03c9=10\n\u03c9=1\n\u03c9=0.1\n\u03c9=0.01\n\u03c9=0.001\n\nF\n\nT=0.3\nT=0.2\nT=0.1\n\nF\n\n20\n\n1E-3\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n1E-3\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 1: Velocity dependence of the frictional force of the tip\nmoving on a substrate coupled to an excitation mode with\ndifferent angular frequencies \u03c9.

In the absence of the coupling to the\nexcitation mode, the logarithmically increase of the friction force with velocity3 was obtained for velocities up\nto tv \u2248 t0 . Now consider what happen if we choose an\nexcitation mode such that tl is several times larger than\nt0 (\u03c9l << \u03c90 ) and we vary tv . As far as the intrinsic frictional damping is concerned, when tv approaches\ntl , the damping should increase and also becomes nonMarkovian. Eventually, when tv becomes very large, the\ndamping should saturate to a Markovian value. So based\non this consideration, the effective \u03b3 should increase and\nsaturate as a function of decreasing v. The frictional\nforce F should exhibit similar behavior. In addition,\n\nFIG. 3: Velocity dependence of the frictional force of the\ntip moving on a substrate coupled to an excitation mode of\nangular frequency \u03c9 = 0.1 at different temperatures T /V0 .\nResults are for the odd-mode model.\n\nthe even mode can lead to a velocity dependent substrate relaxation that changes the effective potential as\ndiscussed previously. However, for the present choice of\nparameters, the velocity dependence of the effective nonadiabatic frictional force due to the coupling to the new\nexcitation mode dominates as evidenced by the results in\nFig. 1 and 2, showing similar results for coupling to an\neven or odd modes.\nThe effect of varying the temperature at fixed mode\nfrequency \u03c9 is also of interest. As can been from Fig.\n3, the qualitative non monotonic behavior remains but\nthere is an increase in the magnitude of the negative slope\nof the velocity-force curve as the temperature decreases.\nWe have also performed additional calculations to\ncheck the effect of including more excitation modes to\nmodel a more realistic continuum model of substrate excitations. 6 independent damped harmonic oscillators with\nfrequencies in a range [\u03c9min , \u03c9max ] with \u03c9min = \u03c9max /6\nwere included in these calculations. As can been seen\nfrom Fig. 4, the behavior for the velocity dependence for\ndifferent maximum frequencies \u03c9max is qualitative similar to the behavior in Fig. 1 at the same temperature.\nThe main effect of the additional modes below \u03c9max is\na tendency to saturation of the frictional force at lower\nfrequencies.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe study the velocity dependence of the frictional force\nof the tip of an atomic force microscope as it is dragged\nacross a surface using a single particle model, taking into\naccount memory effects and thermal fluctuations. In our\nmodel, there is an additional coupling of the particle to\nexcitation modes of the surface modeled by damped har-\n\n\f4\n\n40\n\u03c9max =10\n\u03c9max =1\n\u03c9max =0.1\n\u03c9max=0.01\n\nn=6\n\nF\n20\n\n0\n1E-3\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nV\nFIG. 4: Velocity dependence of the frictional force of the tip\nmoving on a substrate with excitation modes ranging from\n\u03c9min to \u03c9max . 6 modes equally spaced with \u03c9min = \u03c9max /6\nare used. Temperature kT /Vo = 0.3. Results are for the\nodd-mode model..\n\nmonic oscillators10. We find that when the excitation\nmode frequency is comparable to the characteristic frequency of the motion of the tip across the surface potential, the velocity dependence of the frictional force is\nnon monotonic displaying an intermediate velocity range\nwhere the frictional force can decrease with increasing\nvelocity. Therefore, the sliding behavior on the surface\ndepends on the nature the surface through the characteristic frequency of such excitation modes. Recently, nonmonotonic velocity dependence of friction was observed\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nB.N.J.

Salmeron, Phys.\n\nexperimentally6 on surfaces covered with a monolayer.\nThe experimental results were interpreted as resulting\nfrom the chemical nature of the surface, with friction\nincreasing or decreasing with velocity depending on the\npresence of cross-linked H-bonds. It was argued that for\nhigher sliding velocity there is not enough time for reordering to occur and the friction force should decrease\nlogarithmically with velocity, while at lower velocities the\nbreaking and reordering of the H-bonds contribute a new\nsource of friction that increases with decreasing velocity. Our results provide theoretical support for this idea\nthrough an explicit calculation within a simple model.\nThe breaking of glassy domains of H-bonds at a critical stress and reordering introduces a new time scale,\nwhich corresponds in our model to the inverse frequency\nof the additional excitation mode of the surface. The\nnon-monotonic velocity dependence of the friction then\nfollows naturally when the time scale of the motion of\nthe tip across the surface becomes comparable to this\nnew time scale for the excitation mode. However, since\nwe find a non monotonic behavior without invoking any\nglassy behavior, our results suggest that similar behavior\nshould be found even on surfaces without disorder when\nadditional excitation modes are present.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank T.
