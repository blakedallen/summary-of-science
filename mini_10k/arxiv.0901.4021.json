EM transition\nis of considerable interests in heavy quarkonium physics\nfrom both experimental and theoretical aspects [1]. Experimentally, it proves to be a powerful tool to discover\nnew quarkonium states that cannot be directly produced\nin e+ e\u2212 annihilation into a virtual photon. A very recent\nexample is that the long-sought bottomonium ground\nstate, the \u03b7b meson, was finally seen by Babar collaboration in the magnetic dipole (M 1) transition process\n\u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3 [2]. Theoretically, it provides a useful\nmeans to probe the internal structure, and the interplay\nbetween different dynamic scales in quarkonium.\nThe standard textbook treatment of EM transitions is\nbased on the concept of multipole expansion 1 , by assuming the emitted photon to be ultrasoft, i.e. k \u03bc \u223c mv 2 ,\nwhere m is heavy quark mass, v denotes the typical velocity of the quark inside a quarkonium. Consequently,\nthe long wave length of photon cannot resolve the geometrical details of quarkonium. Obviously, the multipole\nexpansion method is valid provided that kr \u226a 1, where\nr \u223c 1/mv is the typical radius of a quarkonium.\nOne of the great theoretical undertakings is to under-\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\njiay@ihep.ac.cn\nxuj@ihep.ac.cn\n\u2021 E-mail: juanzhang@ihep.ac.cn\n1 The literal meaning of this term is to expand the electromagnetic\nfield A\u03bc (t, R\u00b1 2r ) around R, the center-of-mass coordinate of QQ\npair, in powers of the relative coordinate r, and the expansion\nparameter is essentially kr, k denoting the photon momentum.\nSome authors prefer to dubbing it as long wave-length approximation. These two terms are equivalent in this work.\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\nstand EM transitions in a situation where the multipole\nexpansion may break down. It is difficult to find such\na situation in atomic system, since the typical atomic\nenergy spacings are always of order mv 2 \u223c m\u03b12 (where\n\u03b1 \u2248 1/137 is the fine structure constant). By contrast, in\nthe realm of QCD, the linearly-rising inter-quark strong\nforce can host rather highly excited quarkonium states,\nthus one may encounter EM transitions in quarkonium\nwith energetic photon. The aim of this work is to offer\na new perspective to tackle such situation. For definiteness, in this work we will concentrate on the hindered\nmagnetic-dipole (M 1) transition (i.e., two quarkonium\nstates with the same orbital angular momentum but with\ndifferent spin and principal quantum numbers). Such\nstudy is of practical importance, because it will help one\nto better understand the process \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3, where\nthe photon carries a momentum as large as 1 GeV and\nmultipole expansion may cease to be a decent method.\nOne usually assumes that the M 1 transition can proceed without gluon exchange between Q and Q. In the\nnonrelativistic limit, the transition rate between two Swave quarkonia is usually described by the well-known\nformula [1]:\n\u0393[n 3 S1 \u2192 n\u2032 1 S0 + \u03b3]\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ \u221e\n2\nkr\n4 2 k3\nRn0 (r) ,(1)\n\u03b1eQ 2\n=\ndr r2 Rn\u2217 \u2032 0 (r)j0\n3\nm\n2\n0\nwhere eQ is the fractional electric charge of Q, k is the\nphoton momentum viewed in the rest frame of n 3 S1\nstate, and Rnl (r) stands for the radial Schr\u00f6dinger wave\nfunction of quarkonium of principal quantum number\nn and orbital angular\u0001 momentum l. The spherical\n(j0 (x) \u2261 sinx x ) takes into acBessel function j0 kr\n2\ncount the so-called finite-size effect (equivalently, resum-\n\n\f2\nming multipole-exanded magnetic amplitude to all orders). When k is expected to be ultrasoft, it is then legitimate to expand this function, and the leading contribution to the hindered transition vanishes due to orthogonality of wave functions. For several observed hindered\ntransition processes, Eq. (1) usually yields predictions a\nfew times smaller than the measured values.\nIt is widely believed that hindered M 1 transitions are\nvery sensitive to the relativistic corrections to (1). Unfortunately, the way of implementing relativistic corrections\nseems to be rather model-dependent. For example, some\nauthors proposed that, among the contributions from the\nrelativistic corrections to the M 1 transition, the hypothesized scalar-part of the confinement potential may play\nan eminent role, as well as the large anomalous magneticdipole moment that may be acquired by the bound quark\ndue to some nonperturbative mechanism [1]. However,\nboth of these suggestions seem not to be based on a firm\nand indisputable footing. As a matter of fact, a variety of quite different predictions to the transition rates\nof \u03a5(3S, 2S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3 have been made by different authors\nover the years [3]. When confronting with the recently\nestablished experimental results, however, most of them\nseem not to be favored.\nRecently, relativistic corrections to the M 1 transition\nhave been readdressed from the angle of nonrelativistic\neffective field theories (EFT) [4], which allows one to critically examine the validity of some popular, yet maybe\nad hoc, assumptions in many potential model approaches.\nHowever, it still remains a great challenge to accommodate the hindered M 1 transition in this EFT framework.\nFor instance, after including all types of conceivable relativistic corrections, the predicted rate for \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3\nseems to be much larger than the measured one.\nImpressive progress has been made in calculating the\ntransition rate of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3 directly from lattice QCD\nsimulation [5]. However, it is challenging to analyze very\nhindered EM transitions, since excited quarkonium states\nwill be difficult to probe by lattice simulation. There is\nalso attempt to model the coupled channel effects for\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3, but such framework seems not to be very\npredictive due to existence of several purely phenomenological parameters [6].\nk\n\nk\n\np\n\np\u2032\n\np\n\np\u2032\n\np\u0304\n\np\u0304 \u2032\n\np\u0304\n\np\u0304 \u2032\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nFIG. 1: Two of four lowest-order diagrams contributing to\nhindered M 1 transition in our \"hard-scattering\" picture.\n\nIn view of shortcomings of the traditional approaches,\nwe present a new attempt to analyze very hindered M 1\n\ntransition processes typified by \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3. The key\nobservation is very simple: in such situation, it is more\nappropriate to count the radiated photon as semihard\n(k \u03bc \u223c mv, often called soft in NRQCD terminology),\nrather than ultrasoft. As a consequence, we should and\nmust give up the notion of multipole expansion. We further make a key assumption: the leading contribution to\nsuch a very hindered transition is described by Fig. 1.\nThe underlying rationale is that, in order for the spectator antiquark to join the final quarkonium state with\na significant probability, a semihard gluon must be exchanged between Q and Q to exert a kick on it.\nIt may be worth digressing into pion EM form factor\ntemporarily. At large momentum transfer, there exists a\nwell-known factorization theorem for this case [7]:\n2\n\nF\u03c0 (Q ) =\n\nZ 1Z\n0\n\n1\n\ndxdy \u03c6\u03c0 (x)T (x, y, Q)\u03c6\u03c0 (y) + * * * ,(2)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03c0 implies the nonperturbative light-cone distribution amplitude of a pion, and T refers to the hardscattering part, which can be computed in perturbation\ntheory. The lowest-order contribution to T is also depicted by Fig. 1. It is generally believed that, at large\nQ2 , this hard-scattering picture is physically more plausible than the so-called Feynman mechanism (without\nexchange of a hard gluon).\nWe plan to derive a factorization formula analogous\nto (2). In our process, the analogous \"hard-scattering\"\npart is obtained by integrating out the semihard mode.\nWe will assume this part is also perturbatively calculable, crucially because mv \u226b \u039bQCD , which seems legitimate for the \u03a5, presumably even for the \u03c8 family. Quite\nnaturally, we expect that the counterpart of \u03c6\u03c0 (x) in\nour nonrelativistic problem will be the Schr\u00f6dinger wave\nfunction of quarkonium.\nIn passing we highlight the very different role played\nby the semihard mode in this work and in Ref. [4]. In the\nlatter case when photon is treated as ultrasoft, the semihard mode can only appear in loop. In contrast to the\npotential mode (p0 \u223c mv 2 , p \u223c mv), it does not make\ncontribution when descending from NRQCD onto potential NRQCD [4]. According to our scheme, however, the\nsemihard mode already makes crucial contribution at tree\nlevel. It is the very mode that we attempt to integrate\nout perturbatively, in order to fulfill the intended factorization.\nThis said, let us turn to the derivation of the very\nhindered 3 S1 \u2192 1 S0 radiative transition rate. We will\nperform the calculation in a covariant fashion at the level\nof QCD. Since the hard (p\u03bc \u223c m) quanta decouple in this\nprocess, it is also feasible, perhaps more illuminating, to\ndirectly start from NRQCD. We first note that parity and\nLorentz invariance constrain the transition amplitude to\nbe the form\nM[n 3 S1 (P ) \u2192 n\u2032 1 S0 (P \u2032 ) + \u03b3(k)]\n= A \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 P \u03bc \u03b5\u03bd[n 3 S1 ] k \u03b1 \u03b5\u2217\u03b2\n\u03b3 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nwhere \u03b5[n 3 S1 ] and \u03b5\u03b3 represent the polarization vectors\nof the initial quarkonium and the photon, respectively.\nAt the rest frame of the initial state, as we will always\nwork in, the Lorentz structure becomes \u03b5[n 3 S1 ] * k \u00d7 \u03b5\u2217\u03b3 ,\nclearly corresponds to the M 1 transition. The scalar coefficient A encodes all the nontrivial dynamics, and we\nwill proceed to deduce its explicit form.\nWe begin with the parton process Q(p)Q(p\u0304) \u2192\nQ(p\u2032 )Q(p\u0304\u2032 ) + \u03b3(k), as indicated in Fig. 1.

The invariant mass of\nthe pairs are P 2 = 4Eq2 and P \u2032 2 = 4Eq2\u2032 , and the Lorentz\np\np\nscalars Eq = m2 \u2212 q 2 , Eq\u2032 = m2 \u2212 q \u2032 2 , which guarantees that each (anti)quark stays on their mass-shell.\nNote in the rest frame of P (\u2032) , q (\u2032) becomes purely spacelike.\nThe quark propagator in Fig. 1a) can be expanded:\n1\n1\n=\n2\n2\n\u2032\n+ k) \u2212 m\nk * P + 2k * q \u2032\n\u2032\n1\n2k* q\n\u2248\n+ *** ,\n+\nk*P\n(k * P )2\n(p \u2032\n\n(4)\n\nbecause k * q\u2032 \u223c m2 v 2 \u226a k * P \u2032 = k * P \u223c m2 v. We have\nneglected the small q \u2032 0 component induced by the recoiling of P \u2032 , as well as the Lorentz boost effect on q\u2032 , which\nare higher order corrections. The quark propagator in\nFig. 1b) can be expanded in a similar fashion.

If k is nevertheless counted as ultrasoft, the second term can be treated as a perturbation.\nNote our situation is in drastic contrast to the ordinary\nNRQCD calculation for hard exclusive processes. In that\ncase, there is always a hard scale \u2265 m in the propagators,\nso it is safe to neglect q (\u2032) at the zeroth order of NRQCD\nexpansion.\nHaving specified the concrete forms of the quark and\ngluon propagators, we then project the quark amplitude\nfor Q(p)Q(p\u0304) \u2192 Q(p\u2032 )Q(p\u0304\u2032 ) + \u03b3(k) onto the corresponding color-singlet quarkonium Fock states, with the aid\nof the covariant spin projectors accurate to all orders in\nq (\u2032) [8], and include the respective momentum-space wave\nfunction for each quarkonium state (e.g., see [9]). At the\nlowest order in q and q \u2032 , we only need retain the first\n\nterm in (4), and neglect all the occurrences of q (\u2032) in the\nnumerator of the amplitude. It turns out that Fig. 1a)\nthen exactly cancels against Fig. 1b), thus rendering a net\nvanishing result at lowest order in velocity expansion 2 .\nTo obtain a nonvanishing prediction, one must proceed\nto the first order in q (\u2032) in the amplitude. To this level of\naccuracy, it is legitimate to set Eq = Eq\u2032 \u2248 m, since the\ninduced error is of quadratic order in q (\u2032) . It is a curious fact that, if one still keeps only the first term in the\nquark propagator (4), the O(q (\u2032) ) pieces from the spin\nprojectors and the 6q (\u2032) term from the quark propagator\nthen make a nonzero contribution in an individual diagram, but their contributions again cancel upon summing\nFig. 1a) and Fig. 1b). Therefore, the leading surviving\nO(q (\u2032) ) contribution can only be obtained by retaining\nthe second term in the expanded quark propagator (4),\nwhile neglecting q (\u2032) terms altogether in elsewhere of the\namplitude. After some efforts, we can read off the reduced amplitude:\nZZ 3\n4eeQ gs2 CF\nd q d3 q \u2032 \u2217\n\u03c6 \u2032 (q\u2032 )\n2\n(k * P )\n(2\u03c0)3 (2\u03c0)3 n 0\n\u00d7 T (q\u2032 \u2212 q) \u03c6n0 (q),\n\nA = 2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere CF = 43 , and the prefactor 2 indicates that two\nundrawn diagrams make equal contributions as Fig. 1a)+\nb), owing to charge conjugation symmetry. \u03c6n(\u2032) 0 signifies\nthe momentum-space Schr\u00f6dinger wave function, and the\n\"hard-scattering\" kernel is\nT (q) = \u2212\n\nq2\n\nk*q\n.\n+ k * q \u2212 i\u01eb\n\n(7)\n\nEq. (6) is the desired factorization formula in momentum\nspace.\nIt would be more convenient to work with the familiar spatial wave functions. Thanks to the fact that the\n\"hard-scattering\" part depends only on the difference between the relative momenta of two quarkonia, q\u2032 \u2212 q, and\nnot on q or q\u2032 separately, upon Fourier transformations,\none can arrive at a compact expression in the position\nspace via contour integral:\n4eeQ CF \u03b1s\nEnn\u2032 ,\nMn\nZ \u221e\n=\ndr r2 Rn\u2217 \u2032 0 (r) T (r) Rn0 (r),\n\nA =\nEnn\u2032\n\n(8a)\n(8b)\n\n0\n\nwhere R(r) appearing in the overlap integral Enn\u2032 is the\nradial wave function. We have used the relation k * P =\nk Mn and Mn is the mass of the initial-state quarkonium.\nThe dimensionless kernel T (r) is obtained by Fourier\n\n2\n\nThis is somewhat analogous to the hard exclusive process \u03b7b \u2192\nJ/\u03c8J/\u03c8, where the amplitude also vanishes at the lowest order\nin charm quark relative velocity [9].\n\n\f4\ntransforming T (q) and integrating over solid angle:\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\ni\nkr\nkr\n2\nkr\ne 2 kr\nj0\n\u2212 j1\n+ ij1\n,\nT (r) =\nMn r\n2\nkr\n2\n2\n(9)\nx\ncos x\nwhere j1 (x) \u2261 sin\nx2 \u2212 x . It may be worth reminding that the above combination of spherical Bessel functions in the bracket resembles the conventional electricdipole (E1) transition formula with finite-size effect incorporated. Notice T (r) develops an imaginary part,\nsince the exchanged semihard gluon can become on-shell\nwhen q \u2212 q\u2032 = k. However, we would like to stress that,\nthe characteristic virtuality of the exchanged gluon in (5)\nshould be of order m2 v 2 \u226b \u039b2QCD , thus the emergence of\nimaginary part in the \"hard-scattering\" kernel should be\nviewed as an artifact due to ignoring the recoiling effect of\nP\u2032 . If the effect of the imaginary part is insignificant with\nrespect to that of the real part, we may feel such a ignorance is tolerable, otherwise it will indicate a theoretical\ndisaster. As we will see in later phenomenological analysis, the contamination of the imaginary part is indeed\nalways negligible for a class of hindered M 1 transitions\nin bottomonium and charmonium systems.\nIt is interesting to examine the asymptotic form of\nxl\nT (r) as kr \u226a 1. Using jl (x) \u223c (2l+1)!!\nat small x,\nk\n1\none finds T (r) \u2192 3mr + i 4m as kr \u2192 0. It turns out\nthat, the real part might be identified with, up to a con[\u03c3*(r\u00d7r\u00d7B)]/m2\nin\nstant, the O(\u03b1s ) matching coefficient VS\nSec. IIIC of [4] (note there arises some subtle issue regarding gauge invariance). Since the imaginary part becomes\nr-independent in the long wavelength limit, as expected,\nit does not contribute to the hindered M 1 transition.\nFinally we can express the transition width as\n\n\u0393[n 3 S1 \u2192 n\u2032 1 S0 + \u03b3] =\n=\n\nk3\n2\n|A |\n12\u03c0\n\n16 2 k 3 2 2\n2\n\u03b1eQ 2 CF \u03b1s |Enn\u2032 | ,\n3\nMn\n\n(10)\n\nwhere we have averaged upon spin of the initial 3 S1 state\nand sum over two transverse polarizations of the photon.\nEq. (10) is the key formula of this work, which\nlooks quite simple. In evaluating the overlap integral\nEnn\u2032 , the input wave functions are obtained by solving\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with the widely-used Cornell potential model [10] and Buchmuller-Tye (BT) potential\nmodel [11]. Parameters in both potential models are\ntuned such that the bb\u0304 and cc\u0304 spectroscopy below open\nflavor threshold are successfully reproduced. The only\nfreely adjustable parameter seems to be the strong coupling constant, \u03b1s (\u03bc). However, the choice of the renormalization scale \u03bc is by no means arbitrary. On physical\nground, it should be fixed around the typical value of\nthe quark 3-momentum in quarkonium, which is about\n1.2 GeV for bb\u0304 system, and 0.9 GeV for cc\u0304 system [12].\nTherefore, with \u03b1s fixed, our formalism becomes rather\npredictive, and, readily falsifiable.\n\nIn Table I we have tabulated various predictions to hindered M 1 transitions of n3 S1 \u2192 n\u20321 S0 . We also present\nthe numerical results for Enn\u2032 , and reassuringly, the contribution from ImT (r) is indeed insignificant. As one can\ntell, the agreement between our predictions, especially\nfrom the Cornell potential model, and the measurement\nfor the transition rate of \u03a5(3S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3, is strikingly successful. Curiously, for other hindered M 1 transitions,\nwhere the photon is not that energetic so that the multipole expansion method may still apply, our formalism\nagain appears to make a decent account of the measured\ntransition rates, agrees typically within 2 \u2212 3 \u03c3. It seems\nfair to conclude that our simple factorization formula has\npassed quite nontrivial tests. Given the fact that there\nis almost no free parameters in (10), we feel encouraged\nthat our formalism has captured at least some correct\nand relevant ingredients. We hope future measurements\nof \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03b7b \u03b3 can further test our mechanism.\nIt might be tempting to seek simplified expression for\nthe overlap integral Enn\u2032 , by exploiting some hierarchy\nbetween different bb\u0304 energy levels. Higher radial excitation, say, \u03a5(3S), is known to have considerably larger\nradius than \u03b7b . An intuitive guess is that E31 may not\nbe necessarily sensitive to the full profile of R30 (r), instead may only sensitive to its value at small distance\n(about the radius of \u03b7b ). If this were true, one could pull\nR30 (r) outside of the integral, and approximate it by its\nvalue at the origin. The transition rate predicted this way\nturns out to be about two orders of magnitude greater\nthan the measured one! If we play the same game for\n\u2217\nR10\n(r), the result would be about ten times larger than\nthe data. The failure of these approximations may be\nunderstood from the empirical fact that, in the Cornell\nor BT potential models, the average momentum of quark\nin different bb\u0304 energy levels is more or less equal. As a\nresult, there seems no ground to neglect q or q\u2032 in the\n\"hard-scattering\" kernel in (6).\nFor the M 1 transition from n1 S0 to n\u2032 3 S1 , one needs\nmultiply (10) by a statistical factor of 3. Various partial widths for \u03b7b (nS) \u2192 \u03a5\u03b3 are about 10 eV, and that\nfor \u03b7c (2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 is about 1 keV. These bottomonium\ntransitions may be accessible in high-energy hadron collider experiments such as CERN Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC), and BESIII program may provide a chance to\nlook for this charmonium hindered transition.\nAs in any factorization framework, we expect that\nthe factorization formula (6) is perturbatively improvable. It will be a major progress to calculate the next-toleading order correction to the \"hard-scattering\" kernel.\nTo achieve this, it might prove easier to reformulate our\nderivation in the context of NRQCD. It would also be\ninteresting to implement relativistic corrections to (6).\nObviously our strategy needs not to be confined to hindered M 1 transitions only. It should be applicable whenever the radiated photon cannot be viewed as ultrasoft\nand multipole expansion breaks down. It will be interesting to work out the corresponding factorization formula\nfor E1 transitions such as \u03c7bJ (2P ) \u2192 \u03a5\u03b3. It would be\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Measured and predicted branching fractions of various hindered M 1 transition processes n 3 S1 \u2192 n\u2032 1 S0 + \u03b3 for\nbottomonium and charmonium.

The total widths of \u03a5(nS)\nand \u03c8(2S) states, as well as all the quarkonium masses, are taken from PDG08 compilation [13], except \u03b7b mass is taken to\nbe 9389 MeV [2], and \u03b7b (2S) mass taken as 9997 MeV [3].
