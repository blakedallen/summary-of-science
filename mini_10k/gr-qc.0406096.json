This calculation\nwas based not on the usual geodesic equation of motion (EOM), but rather on the geodesic\ndeviation EOM. Contrary to expectations, these phase shifts have a form that is very much\ndifferent from those calculated previously in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. While a\ndirect comparison of the various expressions for the phase shift is difficult because of the\ndifferent configurations of the matter-wave interferometers used for their calculations, it was\nnoted in [1] that the power-law dependence on the frequency of the gravitational wave, in\nboth the low- and high-frequency limit, of the expressions calculated in [1, 2] are at times\ndiametrically opposite to those calculated in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Consequently, we expect\nthat the differences between these expressions are not due simply to differences in the configurations of the interferometers chosen, but are rather caused by fundamental differences\nin the physics on which their derivations are based.\nIn this paper our objective is to demonstrate that these fundamental differences do exist\nby presenting a series of calculations that follows the two basic approaches in the literature\nused to determine the phase shift caused by a gravitational wave. This will be done for\nthe same configuration of matter-wave interferometer, and will allow us to compare the\ndifferent expressions we obtain for the phase shift on an equal footing. We then determine\ntheir validity by comparing each of them, in the appropriate limit, with the well-known\nexpression for the phase shift caused by stationary sources of spacetime curvature [5, 10, 11].\nThe focus in this paper will be on a theoretical study of the underlying physics; we leave\nissues of the practicality and feasibility of constructing the interferometer to [1, 2].\nThe various approaches taken to determine the phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer\ncaused by a gravitational wave can be divided into two distinctly separate classes. The class\nof approaches that is more often found in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is done in\ntransverse-traceless (TT) coordinates (see Sec. 9.2.3 of [12]), either explicitly or implicitly.\nThe TT coordinates are one specific choice of reference frame where the gravitation wave\nis in the TT gauge. In this frame the number of components of the deviations of the flat\nspacetime metric h\u03bc\u03bd caused by the gravitational wave equals the number of physical degrees\nof freedom of the gravitational wave. Consequently, \u2202 \u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd , h0\u03bc = 0, and h\u03bc\u03bc = 0. In addition,\n2\n\n\fthe mirrors and the beam splitters are at fixed coordinate values in these coordinates, and\nthey do not move. These coordinates have been used to study the properties of lightwave-interferometry-based detectors of gravitational waves as well [13]. To calculate the\nphase shift for matter-wave interferometers, it is combined with either the geodesic EOM\n(and its action), if the calculation is done at the quantum-mechanical level [3, 9], or the\nLagrangian (and the WKB or stationary phase approximation) for a quantum field in curved\nspacetime, if the calculation is done at the quantum field-theoretic level [5, 6, 7, 8]. Not\nsurprisingly, irrespective of the level of sophistication of the approach used, the general\nexpressions calculated for the phase shift have the same final form.\nThe other class of approaches to calculating the phase shift is taken by [1, 2], and is done\nin Thorne's \"proper reference frame\". They follow the classical analysis in [12, 14, 15] for\nlight-wave-based interferometers. In this frame, the positions and velocities of test particles\nare measured relative to the worldline of an observer, and follow the motion of the observer in\nspacetime, in much the same way that the Fermi-normal [16], Fermi-Walker coordinates [17],\nand the recently constructed general laboratory frame [18] do. Consequently, the motion\nof the test particle in this frame is not described by the usual geodesic equation of motion\n(EOM), but rather by the geodesic deviation EOM (see Eq. (2) of [12]), which was first\napplied to the analysis of physical systems in [19, 20]. As in [12], the TT gauge was taken\nfor the gravitational wave. The action (see [18, 21, 22]) for the geodesic deviation EOM\nwas then used in conjunction with the quasi-classical approximation of the Feynman-pathintegral formulation of quantum mechanics. This approximation is the Lagrangian form of\nthe WKB approximation in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation of quantum mechanics, and in\n[1, 2] it was applied to the calculation of the phase shift of the two matter-wave-interferometer\nconfigurations.\nThe phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer is a physically measurable quantity.\nFrom the principle of general covariance, it should not matter whether the TT coordinates,\nor whether the proper reference frame is used in its calculation [12, 23]. Indeed, Thorne\nstates the following:\n\"If L << \u03bb then the [gravitational wave] detector can be contained entirely\nin the proper reference frame of its center, and the analysis can be performed\nusing non-relativistic concepts augmented by the quadrupolar gravity-wave force\nfield (3), (5). If one prefers, of course, one instead can analyze the detector in\n3\n\n\fTT coordinates using general relativistic concepts and the spacetime metric (8).\nThe two analyses are guaranteed to give the same predictions for the detector's\nperformance, unless errors are made [emphasis added].\" (From page 400 of [12].)\nEvidently, errors have indeed been made, as we shall see, since the resulting calculations\noften contradict each other for the same interferometer. The power-law dependence on\nfrequency of the phase shifts calculated in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] using TT coordinates are\nfundamentally different from that of the phase shifts calculated in [1, 2] using the proper\nreference frame. Since the principle of general covariance must hold, this means that either\n(a) the calculations in [1, 2] are wrong, (b) the calculations in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] are wrong,\nor (c) all of the calculations of the phase shifts are wrong.\nTo determine which one of these three possibilities is correct, we will present side by side\ncalculations of the phase shift caused by a gravitational wave for one specific matter-waveinterferometer configuration using the following three approaches. The first calculation uses\nthe quasi-classical approximation in the TT coordinates and geodesic action, and is done\nat the nonrelativistic, quantum-mechanics level. It follows, as much as possible, the line of\nanalysis given in [4]. The second calculation is also done at the nonrelativistic, quantummechanics level using the same approximation, but now in the proper reference frame, and\nuses the geodesic deviation action. It follows the line of analysis given in [1].\nThese two calculations would seem to exhaust the two different classes of approaches\ncurrently found in the literature. That a third calculation of the phase shift is needed is\nbecause of an error in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Either because changes in the kinetic energy\nterm in the action for the atom in [4, 9] were neglected, or because the turning points of the\natom's phase at the interferometer's mirrors in the WKB-type of approach in [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nwere omitted, the end result is that important boundary terms are not included in the final\nexpression for the phase shift in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. For the sake of completeness, and\nto compare the calculations in [1, 2] with these previous calculations in the literature, this\nnecessitates a third calculation of the phase shift, which will result in yet another expression\nfor the phase shift based on the geodesic EOM.\nWe find that all three expressions for the phase shift calculated here are different from\none another. Although there are currently no direct experimental checks that can used to\ndetermine which one of these three expressions for the phase shift is correct, an indirect\nexperimental check can be used by taking the low-frequency limit.\n4\n\n\fAll three expressions for the phase shift depend on the transit time of the atom through\nthe interferometer, and the period of the gravitational wave. If the transit time of the atom\nis much shorter than the period, then, with respect to the atom, the gravitational wave\ndoes not oscillate appreciably as it traverses the interferometer. The gravitational wave will\ncontribute a local Riemannian curvature to the spacetime that is effectively static. The phase\nshift of matter-interferometers caused by static (as well as stationary) sources of curvature\nis well established [5, 10, 11], and has been shown to be proportional to components of the\nRiemann curvature tensor. Just as importantly, this phase shift can be calculated using only\nNewtonian gravity [Eq. (2.6) of [10]]. The phase shift due to the Newtonian gravitational\npotential-through the acceleration due to Earth's gravity g-has been measured, first by\nCollela, Overhauser and Werner [24], and more recently by Chu and Kasevich [25]. These\nmore recent measurements of the phase shift induced by g are sensitive enough that effect\nof spatial variations in g-which are proportional to the static Riemann curvature of the\nspacetime caused by the Earth-on the phase shift can be discerned. Gradients in g were\nseen through changes in the phase shift of an atomic fountain when its vertical position\nwas varied [26]. More recently, they were seen through a differential measurement of the\nphase shifts of two atomic fountain matter-wave interferometers operating in tandem [27].\nTherefore, while the direct measurement of the phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer\ncaused by a static Riemann curvature tensor has not been made, its discovery is expected.\nIndeed, indications are that the phase shift induced by the static Riemann curvature of the\nEarth has already been seen [28].\nAs a consequence of the above, in the limit of low-frequency gravitational waves the\nphase shift calculated for the matter-wave interferometer must approach the well-known\nstatic result, and be proportional to the curvature tensor. We will see that in this limit,\nonly the phase shift calculated along the lines of [1, 2] has the correct form. The other two\ndo not, and must be wrong, since they do not yield the correct static limit.\nOur focus here is on the phase shift that a gravitational wave will induce on a matter-wave\ninterferometer. We will thus neglect the effects of all other gravitational effects-such as the\nacceleration due to Earth's gravity, and the local curvature of spacetime due to stationary\nsources such as the Earth, Sun and Moon-in addition to the phase shift due to the Sagnac\neffect caused by the Earth's rotation. We have shown in [18] that for these types of stationary\ngravitational effects the description of the motion of test particles in the general laboratory\n5\n\n\fframe-of which the proper reference frame is a special case-reduces to the usual geodesic\nEOM description, and there is no controversy. The phase shifts caused by these stationary\neffects calculated in either the proper reference frame or the TT coordinates will be the\nsame.\nWe will in this paper use the same notation the is commonly found in the literature\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular, it follows the notation in [12]. While this has the\nbenefit of consistency and simplicity, it means that we do not separate with notation the\ncoordinates used for the TT coordinates from the coordinate used for the proper reference\nframe. The coordinates used in the two reference frames have different physical meanings,\nwhich we will make clear in the next section. These differences are outlined in detail in [18].\n\nII.\n\nPHASE-SHIFT CALCULATIONS\n\nIn this section we will present two of the three calculations of the phase shift mentioned\nin the introduction. The first calculation will be done in the TT coordinates, and will be\nbased on the geodesic EOM. The second calculation will be done in the proper reference\nframe, and will be based on the geodesic deviation EOM. A third calculation, following the\napproach in the literature, will be done in the next section where comparisons between the\ndifferent results of the calculations are made. All three calculations are done for gravitational waves in the long-wavelength limit for the matter-wave interferometer configuration\nshown in Fig. 1; this configuration is described in detail in appendix A. To calculate the\nphase shifts, we will use the quasi-classical approximation of the Feynman path integral\nrepresentation of quantum mechanics. This approximation is the Lagrangian version of the\nWKB approximation, or stationary phase approximation, in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation\nof quantum mechanics, and will be reviewed in appendix A as well. The presentation in\nthis section is done in detail to ensure that all the underlying assumptions, approximations,\nand subtleties in our analysis are readily apparent.\n\n6\n\n\fA.\n1.\n\nGeodesic-EOM-based calculation of the phase shift\nClassical Dynamics in TT Coordinates\n\nConsider a gravitational wave in the long-wavelength limit with an amplitude h\u03bc\u03bd (t)\nincident perpendicularly to the plane of the interferometer in Fig. 1. As usual, Greek indices\nrun from 0 to 4, and Latin indices run from 1 to 3. The gravitational wave is represented by\nthe tensor h\u03bc\u03bd as a perturbation on the flat spacetime metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , so that the total metric\nof the spacetime is g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd . We have chosen the signature of g\u03bc\u03bd to be (\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nIn the TT-gauge, a coordinate system is chosen so that in these coordinates, \u2202 \u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\nh0\u03bc = 0, and h\u03bc\u03bc = 0; the only nonvanishing components of h\u03bc\u03bd are thus hij .\nOne choice of coordinates where the TT gauge is realized is the TT coordinates (see [12]\nand the general analysis in [29]). In these coordinates the action for the atom with mass m\nused in Fig. 1 is the usual geodesic action in the nonrelativistic limit,\nSgeo\n\n\u00131/2\nZ \u0012\nZ\n\u0002 i j\n\u0003\ndx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n1\n2\n= \u2212m\n\u2212\ng\u03bc\u03bd\nv v (\u03b4ij + hij ) dt,\ndt \u2248 \u2212mc t + m\ndt dt\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the subscript \"geo\" stands for \"geodesic\". Since the rest mass mc2 only shifts the\nLagrangian for the atom by a constant, we drop this term from Sgeo . The nonrelativistic\nHamiltonian for the motion is then,\nHgeo\n\n1 i j\np~ 2\n\u2212\np p hij ,\n=\n2m 2m\n\n(2)\n\nwhich results in the usual geodesic equation of motion\nj\nj\nd2 xi\ni dx\ni dx\n=\n\u22122\u0393\n=\n\u2212\n\u1e23\n.\n0j\nj\ndt2\ndt\ndt\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd is Christoffel symbol for the spacetime; for gravitational waves in the TT gauge,\n\u0393i0j = \u1e23ij /2.\nTo calculate the phase shift of Fig. 1, we follow the description in appendix A, and\nconsider the phase shift due to the rth atom emitted from the atomic source, which at\na time tr is diffracted by the initial beam splitter. There are two possible classical paths\nfor the atom through the interferometer. In the absence of gravitational waves, these are\nstraight-line paths ~x0 (t) (see appendix A), which will be shifted when a gravitational wave\nis present. These shifts are expected to be very small, however, and we can use perturbation\n7\n\n\fFIG. 1: Schematic of the matter-wave interferometer configuration considered in this paper with\na gravitational wave incident normal to the plane of the interferometer shown. Only the \u00d7 polarization contributes to the phase shift; the + polarization does not. Diffraction orders other than\nn = \u00b11 are not used, and are left out for clarity.\n\ntheory to solve for them. We thus take ~x(t) = ~x0 (t) + ~x1 (t), and ~v(t) = ~v0 (t) + ~v1 (t), where\n~x1 (t) and ~v1 (t) are perturbations to the atom's path ~x0 (t) and velocity ~v0 (t), respectively;\nwe will keep only terms linear in ~v1 (t). To first order in hij , Eq. (3) becomes\ndv1i\n= \u2212\u1e23ij v0j .\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nOnce ~x0 (t) is determined, v1 (t) is solved for by dividing the trajectory of an atom into two\nparts: from the initial beam splitter to the mirror, and then from the mirror to the final\nbeam splitter. The two paths are then joined with the appropriate boundary conditions at\nthe mirror.\nWe begin by determining ~x0 (t).\n\n8\n\n\f2.\n\nTrajectories in the absence of gravitational waves\n\nTo determine the unperturbed path of the atoms through the interferometer-which is\nthe same no matter which approach is used to calculate the phase shifts-consider first the\npath of the atom that is diffracted into the n = +1 diffraction order. We will assume that\nthe velocity of the atoms is high enough that we can ignore the effect of Earth's gravity on\nthe atom. It is then clear that for tr < t < tr + T /2-during which it travels between the\ninitial beam splitter and the first mirror in a time T /2-the path of the atom is\nv0x = vk ,\n\nx0 (t) = vk (t \u2212 tr ),\n\nv0y = v\u22a5 ,\n\ny0 (t) = v\u22a5 (t \u2212 tr ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere vk and v\u22a5 are x and y components of the velocity of the atom immediately after it\nleaves the initial beam splitter. At tr +T /2 the atom is reflected off the hard-wall mirror, and\nfrom the general expression of the boundary condition for the atom at the mirror Eq. (A2),\nv0x (tr + T + /2) = v0x (tr + T \u2212 /2) = vk , while v0y (tr + T + /2) = \u2212v0y (tr + T \u2212 /2) = \u2212v\u22a5 . (The\nsuperscripts \u00b1 denote lim\u01eb\u21920 tr + T /2 \u00b1 \u01eb respectively.) For the subsequent time interval\ntr + T /2 < t < tr + T , the atom's path is\nv0x = vk ,\nv0y = \u2212v\u22a5 ,\n\nx0 (t) = vk (t \u2212 tr ),\ny0 (t) = L\u22a5 \u2212 v\u22a5 (t \u2212 tr ),\n\n(6)\n\nduring which it travels between the mirror and the final beam splitter. It is clear that L\u22a5 =\nv\u22a5 T and Lk = vk T , and T is the total transit time of the atom through the interferometer.\nThe unperturbed path for the atom in the n = \u22121 diffraction order is similar to Eqs. (5)\nand (6), and is obtained by taking v\u22a5 \u2192 \u2212v\u22a5 and L\u22a5 \u2192 \u2212L\u22a5 .\n\n3.\n\nBoundary conditions\n\nTo determine the boundary conditions for ~v1 in Eq. (4), we note that from Eq. (3) the\nacceleration of a test particle for the geodesic EOM is proportional to its velocity. As such, a\ntest particle which was initially at rest will stay at rest, even in the presence of a gravitational\nwave. This led to the following conclusion by Stodolsky:\n\"In this discussion [of matter-wave interferometry] we have assumed that the\nparts of the apparatus [interferometer] stay at fixed coordinate values. This can\n9\n\n\fbe achieved if these parts are free masses, since a metric of the gravity wave type\n(with no \"0\" components) does not affect the positions of nonmoving bodies.\"\n(From page 399 of [4].)\nThus, in the TT coordinates, the positions of beam splitters and the mirrors do not change\nwhen a gravitational wave passes through the system.\nThe velocity of the atoms travelling between the supersonic source and the initial beam\nsplitter, on the other hand, will be affected by the gravitational wave. Since the interferometer in Fig. 1 is balanced, only differences in the atom's trajectory along the two paths\nthrough it will matter. We can thus neglect any shifts in the atom's velocity before it reaches\nthe beam splitter. And, since the initial beam splitter is not moved by the gravitational\nwave, v0x (tr ) = vk while v0y (tr ) = v\u22a5 ; thus we take ~v1 (tr ) = 0.\nFor the boundary conditions at the mirror, we note that like the beam splitter, the\npositions of the mirrors in the interferometer also do not change when a gravitational wave\nis present. Thus the boundary conditions for ~v1 (t) across the hard-wall mirrors is\nv1x (tr + T + /2) = v1x (tr + T \u2212 /2),\n\nv1y (tr + T + /2) = \u2212v1y (tr + T \u2212 /2).\n\n(7)\n\nIntegrating Eq. (4) is now straightforward, and for tr < t < tr + T /2,\nv1x (t) = \u2212vk hxx (t) \u2212 v\u22a5 hxy (t) + vk hxx (tr ) + v\u22a5 hxy (tr ),\nv1y (t) = \u2212vk hxy (t) \u2212 v\u22a5 hyy (t) + vk hxy (tr ) + v\u22a5 hyy (tr ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhile for tr + T /2 < t < tr + T ,\nv1x (t) = \u2212vk hxx (t) + v\u22a5 hxy (t) + vk hxx (tr ) \u2212 2v\u22a5 hxy (tr + T /2) + v\u22a5 hxy (tr ),\nv1y (t) = \u2212vk hxy (t) + v\u22a5 hyy (t) \u2212 vk hxy (tr ) + 2vk hxy (tr + T /2) \u2212 v\u22a5 hyy (tr ).\n\n4.\n\n(9)\n\nThe phase shift\n\nWe now calculate the action for the rth atom as it travels through along the upper path\nthrough the interferometer.

The ~v02 term in Eq. (10) is the same for both paths\nthrough the interferometer, and will not contribute to the phase shift. It can be neglected.\nThe last term v0i v0j hij can be trivially integrated using Eqs. (5) and (6), while the ~v0 *~v1 term\ncan be integrated using Eqs. (8) and (9). We then get\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\nS\u0303clgeo [~x(tr ), ~x(tr + T ); \u03b3+1] =T vk2 hxx (tr ) + v\u22a5\nhyy (tr )\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1 tr +T 2\n2\n\u2212\nvk hxx (t) + v\u22a5 hyy (t) dt\n2 tr\n\u0014\n\u0015\n+ 2v\u22a5 vk T hxy (tr ) \u2212 hxy (tr + T /2)\n\u2212 v\u22a5 vk\n\nZ\n\ntr +T /2\n\nhxy (t) dt \u2212\n\nZ\n\ntr +T\n\nhxy (t) dt ,\n\ntr +T /2\n\ntr\n\n!\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the tilde denotes the fact that we have dropped the ~v 2 term from the action.

The first result of our comparison of phase-shift calculations for\nthe interferometer shown in Fig. 1 is given in Eq. (14). The derivation of these equations is\nbased on the geodesic equation of motion using the TT coordinates. We will find that the\nphase shift calculated in all three approaches in this paper will have this same overall form,\nand will differ only in the resonance function Fgeo .\n11\n\n\fB.\n\nGeodesic-deviation-EOM-based calculation of the phase shift\n\nReference frames centered on the worldline of an observer, such as the proper reference\nframe and general laboratory frame, are less commonly used than the TT coordinates used\nin the previous subsection. We therefore begin the calculation of the phase shift for Fig. 1\nin the proper reference frame with a brief review of this frame.\n\n1.\n\nThe proper reference frame\n\nHow the proper reference frame is constructed is described as follows:\n\"Consider an observer (freely falling or accelerated, it doesn't matter so long\nas the acceleration is slowly varying). Let the observer carry with herself a\nsmall Cartesian latticework of measuring rods and synchronized clocks (a 'proper\nreference frame' in the sense of Sec. 13.6 of MTW, with spatial coordinates xj\nthat measure proper distance along orthogonal axes).\" (From page 339 of [12].)\nIn this frame the coordinate xi (t) is the position of a nonrelativistic test particle travelling along its worldline relative to the worldline of the observer at her propertime t. The\nmagnitude of xi (t) is then the distance between the worldline of the test particle, and the\nworldline of the observer at the same instant of time t. This frame is only valid when the\ntest particle is moving nonrelativistically, and the size of the apparatus is small compared\nto the wavelength of the gravitational wave. The velocity v i (t) = \u1e8bi is then the velocity of\nthe test particle measured relative to the observer.\nIn the absence of all other forces, both the test particle and the observer travel along\ngeodesics in the spacetime, and thus their motion are each, separately, governed by geodesic\nEOMs. By subtracting the geodesic EOM of the observer from that of the test particle, and\nthen expanding the resultant to first order in xi (t), the motion of the test particle as seen\nby the observer is governed by\n\nd2 xi\ni\n= \u2212R0j0\nxj .\ndt2\n\n(15)\n\nThis is the geodesic deviation EOM, and it holds as long as the local Riemann curvature\ni\ntensor of the spacetime R0j0\nvaries so slowly with xi that it can be approximated as a\n\nconstant. This condition holds in the long-wavelength limit of the gravitational wave.\n12\n\n\fAs observed in [12] for LIGO (the Laser I nterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory),\nif the characteristic size of the interferometer L is much smaller than the reduced wavelength\n\u03bb of the gravitational wave the interferometer is contained entirely within the proper reference frame. One does not need to use TT coordinates. Like LIGO, the characteristic size\nof the interferometers considered in [1, 2] is also smaller than the reduced wavelength of the\ngravitational wave [1, 2], and thus the use of the proper reference frame was also valid. We\nshall assume that this is true for the interferometer shown in Fig. 1 as well.\ni\ni\nWe will also follow Thorne [12], and take R0j0\n= \u2212\u1e27ij /2. This relation between R0j0\nand\n\nhij holds only when the \"TT gauge\" is taken. Because of the naturalness of its construction,\nit should be expected that the TT gauge-where the number of independent components\nof hij equals the number of degrees of freedom for the gravitational wave-can be taken for\nthe proper reference frame as well as for the TT coordinates, but this has not been shown\nexplicitly in the literature [30]. As we shall see in appendix B, this can be done explicitly\nin the general laboratory frame. It can thus be done in the proper reference frame since it\nwas shown in [18] that the general laboratory frame reduces to the proper reference frame\nin the long-wavelength limit for the gravitational waves.\n\n2.\n\nClassical Dynamics in the proper reference frame\n\nFor our calculation of the phase shift in the proper reference frame using the geodesic\ndeviation EOM, the observer is fixed on the initial beam splitter, and the motion of all\nobjects, and thus the phase shift, is measured with respect to it (see Fig. 1). In this\nreference frame, the action for a test particle is (see [18] or [22] for a derivation)\n\u0013\nZ \u0010\nZ \u0012\n\u0011\n1\n1 2\nj i\n~v \u2212 vi x \u03930j dt = m\n~v 2 \u2212 v i xj \u1e23ij dt,\nSGD = m\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the subscript \"GD\" stands for \"geodesic deviation\", and we have dropped the mc2\nterm. As in Eq. (4) of [12], we have taken the gravitational wave to be in the TT gauge in\nEq. (16). The resulting Hamiltonian (see also [21]) in this case is\nHGD =\n\np~ 2\np~ 2\n1\n+ \u0393i0j xj pi =\n+ \u1e23ij xi pj ,\n2m\n2m 2\n\n(17)\n\nto lowest order in hij . It is straightforward to see from Eq. (16) that the EOM for the test\nparticle is the geodesic deviation equation Eq. (15). We once again solve perturbatively for\nthe classical trajectories, which are determined now by Eq. (15), and take ~x(t) = ~x0 (t)+~x1 (t).\n13\n\n\f3.\n\nBoundary conditions and mirror effects\n\nUnlike the geodesic EOM [Eq. (3)], in the geodesic deviation EOM [Eq. (15)] the acceleration depends on the position of the test particle, and not on its velocity. Consequently,\nwhen a gravitational wave passes through the system, it shifts the position of all parts of the\ninterferometer except the initial beam splitter, where xi \u2261 0 due to our choice of origin. We\ncan thus take ~v1 (tr ) = 0 as an initial condition for ~v1 (t) once again. In addition, from the\nforce lines drawn in Fig. 1 we see by symmetry that it is the \u00d7 polarization that contributes\nto the phase shift, and not the + polarization. For this polarization, the motion induced on\nthe final beam splitter by the gravitational wave also does not affect the overall phase shift.\nWhile the motion of the final beam splitter does not affect the phase shift of the atoms,\nthe motion of the mirrors in response to the gravitational wave will. This motion changes\nthe boundary condition for the atom at the mirrors from the simple expression Eq. (A2).\n~ denote the position of the mirror placed in the upper path of the interferometer,\nLet X\nand let V~ denote its velocity. In absence of the gravitational wave the mirrors do not move,\n~ 1 are fluctuations in the\nand we can take X = Lk /2 + X1 and Y = L\u22a5 /2 + Y1 , where X\npositions of the mirror due to the gravitational wave. Because of these fluctuations, the\nboundary condition Eq. (7) for v1y (t) at the mirror now becomes\nv1y (tr + T + /2) = \u2212v1y (tr + T + /2) + V1y (tr + T /2),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere Vy = \u1e8e = \u1e8e1 .\nTo determine the response V1y (t) of the mirror to the gravitational wave, we follow [1, 2],\nand model the mirror, and its connection to the frame of the interferometer, as a spring\nwith a quality factor Q and resonance frequency \u03c90 (see also section 37.6 of [15]). This\nfrequency depends on the size of the interferometer as well as its material properties. From\n~\nthe equivalence principle, the motion X(t)\nof the mirror, like that of the atom, is also a\nsolution of Eq. (15), but because the mirrors are connected to damped springs,\n\u03c90\n1\n1\n\u1e8a1 + \u03c902 X1 (t) = Lk \u1e27xx + L\u22a5 \u1e27xy ,\nQ\n4\n4\n1\n1\n\u03c90\nY \u03081 + Y \u03071 + \u03c902Y1 (t) = L\u22a5 \u1e27yy + Lk \u1e27xy .\nQ\n4\n4\n\n\u1e8c1 +\n\n14\n\n(19)\n\n\f4.\n\nThe Phase Shift\n\nThe action for the atom along the upper path through the interferometer in the proper\nreference frame is\ncl\nSGD\n[~x(tr ), ~x(tr\n\n1\n+ T ]; \u03b3+1) \u2261 m\n2\n\u2248\n\n1\nm\n2\n\nZ\n\ntr +T\n\ntr\nZ tr +T\ntr\n\nn\n\n2\n\nv0i xj0 \u1e23ij\n\no\n\ndt\n[~v0 (t) + ~v1 (t)] \u2212\n\u001b i\nZ tr +T \u001a\n1 j\ndx0\n2\nv1i \u2212 x0 \u1e23ij\n~v0 dt + m\ndt, (20)\n2\ndt\ntr\n\nwhere once again \"cl\" stands for \"classical\".

It is readily apparent from the form of Fgeo and FGD that the corresponding phase\nshifts \u2206\u03c6geo and \u2206\u03c6GD do not agree with each other even if the Lorentzian term in FGD is\nneglected. Moreover, as we will see in the next section, both phase shifts are different from\nthe phase shift calculated previously in the literature as well. There are thus three different\nexpressions for the phase shift for the same matter-wave interferometer. To determine the\ncorrect expression, we consider the low-frequency limit of these expressions, and compare\ntheir limiting forms to the phase shift of caused by a static Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nA.\n\nHow the Correct Phase Shift is to be Determined\n\nThe motion of test particles in stationary spacetimes has been well studied experimentally both directly, through measurements of the advance of the perihelion of Mercury, the\ndeflection of light, and the gravitational redshift [15] in the weak gravity limit, and indirectly,\nthrough the slow-down of the Taylor-Hulse pulsar [31] in the strong gravity limit. It has also\nbeen well studied theoretically through analyses of various black hole geometries [32]. The\n17\n\n\fmotion of test particles in nonstationary spacetimes, such as when a gravitational wave is\npresent, has not been established to the same level of certainty. On an experimental level,\nuntil LIGO has detected a gravitational wave, there will have been no direct measurements\nof the motion of test particles in nonstationary spacetimes. On a theoretical level, while\nit would seem that the motion of test particles in nonstationary spacetimes has been well\nstudied, a recent analysis [18] based on the general laboratory frame has detailed differences\nin the dynamics of test particles in nonstationary versus stationary spacetimes.\nThere is, however, is no disagreement-on either on a theoretical or an experimental\nlevel-over the motion of text particles in stationary spacetimes. Indeed, it was explicitly\ndemonstrated that in this case the general laboratory frame [18] (and thus the proper reference frame) goes over to the standard description of the motion of test particles in stationary\nspacetimes using the geodesic EOM.\nThe phase shift \u2206\u03c6static of a matter-wave interferometer due to a static curvature is well\nstatic\nknown, and can be written as \u2206\u03c6static \u223c mAij T R0i0j\n/~, where |Aij | is the area of the\nstatic\ninterferometer, T is the transit time of the atom through the interferometer, and R0i0j\nare\n\nthe components of the static Riemann curvature tensor in the plane of the interferometer\n(see [10], Eq. (2.6) of [11], and Eq. (2.23) of [5]). While the calculation of the calculation\nof \u2206\u03c6static in [11] and [5] was based on general relativity, \u2206\u03c6static can be derived using only\nNewtonian gravity-where the static curvature is formed from gradients of g-as was done\nin [10]. Newtonian gravity has been experimentally verified, of course, and the effect of\ng on the phase shift of massive particles in matter-wave interferometers is well known for\nneutrons [24], and for atoms [25, 26]. The effect of the static Riemann curvature of the Earth\nhas also been seen in measurements of the gradients in g using differential measurements of\nthe phase shift caused by g at differing heights [26, 27]. While indirect, these all serve as\nexperimental indications that \u2206\u03c6static holds. Indeed, there are indications that the phase\nshift induced by the static Riemann curvature of the Earth has already been seen [28].\nConsider now the limit where the period of a gravitational wave is very long compared\nto the transit time of the atom through the interferometer. The gravitational wave does not\noscillate appreciably in the time it takes for the atom to traverse the interferometer, and to\nthe atom, the curvature of the spacetime caused by the gravitational wave is effectively a\nstatic one. Correspondingly, the phase shift induced by the gravitational wave should have\nthe same form as the phase shift induced by a static Riemann curvature. This correspondence\n18\n\n\fbetween the gravitational wave-induced, and the static-curvature-induced phase shifts serves\nas a check of our results. When it is combined with the experimental results [24, 25, 26, 27],\nwe conclude that the correct phase shift must have a low-frequency limit that has the same\nform as \u2206\u03c6static .\n\nB.\n\nThe Low-frequency Limit\n\nUnlike Fgeo , which depends only on the transit time T of the atoms through the interferometer, and the period 2\u03c0/\u03c9 of the gravitational wave, FGD depends on the period 2\u03c0/\u03c90\nof the resonance frequency of the mirror-interferometer assembly as well. Both T and \u03c90\nare fixed by the design of the interferometer, while \u03c9 can, in principle, take a broad range\nof values. We note, however, that the resonance frequency of the interferometer can be\nestimated as \u03c90 \u223c 2\u03c0vsound /Lk , where vsound is the speed of sound of the material used to\nconstruct the interferometer. In almost all cases, vk << vsound , and since 1/T = Lk /vk ,\n2\u03c0/\u03c90 << T .\nIf the transit time of the atom is much shorter than the period of the gravitational wave\nso that T << 2\u03c0/\u03c9, then \u03c9 << \u03c90 as well. In this low-frequency limit, the gravitational\nwave will not oscillate in the time it takes the atom to traverse the interferometer, nor will\nthe mirrors oscillate appreciably during this time. This, then, corresponds to the static-limit\nconditions considered above.\nFrom Eq. (14), we see that in this low-frequency limit where \u03c9T /4 << \u03c0/2, Fgeo \u2248 \u22123.\nThen\n\u2206\u03c6geo (\u03c9) \u2248\n\nm\n3m\nLk L\u22a5 i\u03c9h\u00d7 (\u03c9) = \u22123 Lk L\u22a5 \u0393x0y (\u03c9),\n2~\n~\n\n(29)\n\nsince \u0393x0y (\u03c9) = \u2212i\u03c9 \u1e23\u00d7 (\u03c9)/2. Thus, \u2206\u03c6geo (\u03c9) is proportional to the Fourier transform of\nthe Christoffel symbols for the gravitational wave in the low frequency limit, and not the\nRiemann curvature tensor. It thus has an incorrect limiting form.\nIf we now take the low-frequency limit of Eq. (28), we find that FGD \u2248 \u2212i\u03c9T /2 to lowest\norder, so that\n\u2206\u03c6GD (\u03c9) \u2248 \u2212\n\nm\nm\nLk L\u22a5 T \u03c9 2 h\u00d7 (\u03c9) = \u2212 Lk L\u22a5 R0x0y (\u03c9),\n4~\n2~\n\n(30)\n\nsince R0x0y (\u03c9) = \u03c9 2 h\u00d7 (\u03c9)/2. Thus, unlike \u2206\u03c6geo (\u03c9), \u2206\u03c6GD (\u03c9) is proportional to the Riemann curvature tensor, and has the correct limiting form.\n19\n\n\fThe differences in the low-frequency behavior of \u2206\u03c6geo and \u2206\u03c6GD are shown Fig. 2,\nwhere we have graphed \u2206\u03c6(\u03c9)/R0x0y (\u03c9) versus \u03c9 for both expressions of the phase shift.\nFor completeness, we have also included in this comparison the phase shift \u2206\u03c6LT S for the\nmatter-wave interferometer Fig. 1 calculated using the Linet-Tourenc-Stodolsky formula\n[3, 4]. As we mentioned in the introduction, a third calculation of the phase shift of Fig. 1\nbased also on the geodesic EOM is necessary, and in the next section this phase shift \u2206\u03c6LT S\nis explicitly calculated for our interferometer using the Liner-Tourrenc-Stodolsky formula.\nFor now, we note that the graphs in Fig. 2 were plotted using the parameters of the \"Earthbase horizontal MIGO\" described [1], which has the same configuration as the interferometer\nwe consider here in Fig. 1. This interferometer has a L\u22a5 = 1.2 m, Lk = 4 km, T = 0.58\ns, Q = 1, \u03c90 = 31, 000 rad/s, and used 6 Li with m = 1 \u00d7 10\u221224 gm. The plots in Fig. 2\ncover the same frequency range considered in [1]. Notice that for frequencies much less than\n2\u03c0/T = 11 rad/s, \u2206\u03c6GD /R0x0y approaches a constant, indicating that \u2206\u03c6GD \u221d R0x0y for\nlow frequencies, as expected, while both \u2206\u03c6geo /R0x0y , and \u2206\u03c6LT S /R0x0y do not.\nThe behavior of all three phase shifts also differ dramatically at high frequencies. We\nwill consider the high-frequency behavior of \u2206\u03c6GD in appendix C.\n\nIV.\n\nPREVIOUS PHASE-SHIFT CALCULATIONS\n\nWe now compare results of the above calculations with those done previously in the\nliterature.\n\nA.\n\nCalculations done at the quantum-mechanical level\n\nCalculations of the phase shift by Linet and Tourrenc [3], and Stodolsky [4] were both done\nat the quantum-mechanical level, but unlike us, they presented a completely general analysis,\nand did not take the nonrelativistic limit for the interfering particles they considered. Their\nexpressions for the phase shift were thus manifestly covariant. Linet and Tourrenc did not\nexplicitly define the coordinate system that they used, while Stodolsky only referred to the\npresentation by Landau and Lifschitz [33] on synchronous reference frames. It is clear that\nsince a gravitational wave in the TT gauge has h0\u03bc = 0, the TT coordinates is a synchronous\nreference frame as well. Since both calculations were ultimately based on the action for the\n\n20\n\n\fFIG. 2: A plot of \u2206\u03c6(\u03c9)/R0x0y (\u03c9) versus \u03c9 for \u2206\u03c6GD , \u2206\u03c6geo , and \u2206\u03c6LT S , for the interferometer\nFig. 1 using L\u22a5 = 1.2 m, Lk = 4 km, T = 0.58 s, Q = 1, \u03c90 = 31, 000 rad/s, and used 6 Li with\nm = 1 \u00d7 10\u221223 gm.\n\ngeodesic EOM, they were implicitly done in the TT coordinates.\nLinet and Tourrenc used the WKB approximation in the quasi-classical limit, and replaced the mass-shall constraint g \u03bc\u03bd p\u03bc p\u03bd = \u2212mc2 (note that the signature of their metric\nis different from ours) with a differential equation in the phase of the wavefunction for the\ntest particle by making the substitution p\u03bc = (i/~)\u2202\u03bc . Stodolsky worked directly with the\naction, and used the quasi-classical approximation we followed here to calculate the phase\nshift. The expression for the phase shift derived by both nevertheless have the same overall form. The phase shift (given in Eq. [3.2.3] of [3]) derived by Linet and Tourrenc does,\nhowever, differ from the original phase shift (given in Eq. (2.4) of [4]) derived by Stodolsky\nby a factor of 2. Since Stodolsky uses the Linet and Tourrenc phase shift expression (the\n21\n\n\fequation above Eq. (6.1) of [4]) to calculate the phase shift for a model interferometer, we\nwill do so also. In the nonrelativistic limit of the atoms that we are interested in, this phase\nshift reduces to\n\u2206\u03c6LT S\n\n1m\n=\n2~\n\nI\n\nv i v j hij dt,\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is different from \u2206\u03c6geo , even though both were calculated in TT coordinates.\nTo understand the origin of the difference between \u2206\u03c6LT S and \u2206\u03c6geo , let us write Sgeo =\npot\nkin\n, where\n+ Sgeo\nSgeo\nkin\nSgeo\n\n1\n= m\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\npot\nSgeo\n\n~v dt,\n\n1\n= m\n2\n\nZ\n\nv i v j hij dt,\n\n(32)\n\nand the superscript \"kin\" stands for \"kinetic\", while the superscript \"pot\"stands for \"popot\npot\ntential\". Clearly, \u2206\u03c6geo = \u2206\u03c6kin\ngeo + \u2206\u03c6geo . Since \u2206\u03c6LT S = \u2206\u03c6geo , contributions to the total\n\nphase shift \u2206\u03c6kin\ngeo from changes to the kinetic energy of the test particle as it traverses the\ninterferometer was not taken into account in Eq. (31). This kinetic term cannot be neglected,\nhowever. The passage of the gravitational wave through the system will cause shifts in the\nvelocity of the atom as it traverses the interferometer, and thus to its kinetic energy. In\npot\nfact, by using Eqs. (8) and (9), it is straightforward to show that \u2206\u03c6kin\ngeo = \u22122\u2206\u03c6geo + B.T.,\n\nwhere B.T. are boundary terms for the atoms at the mirrors. These terms do not vanish,\nbut instead contribute the 4 sinc (\u03c9T /4) term to Fgeo .\nIf we nonetheless use \u2206\u03c6LT S to calculate the phase shift for Fig. 1, we once again find\nthat \u2206\u03c6LT S has the same form as Eqs. (14) and (28),\nm\nLk L\u22a5 i\u03c9h\u00d7 (\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9T /2 FLT S (\u03c9T ),\n2~\n\u0014\n\u00152\nFLT S (\u03c9T ) = \u2212 sinc (\u03c9T /4) .\n\n\u2206\u03c6LT S (\u03c9) \u2261 \u2212\n\n(33)\n\nThe final result of our comparison of phase-shift calculations for the interferometer shown\nin Fig. 1 is given in Eq. (33). While these equations, like Eq. (14), are also based on the\ngeodesic equation of motion using the TT coordinates, FLT S nonetheless differs from Fgeo\nby the term 4 sinc (\u03c9T /4). This term comes directly from the boundary terms neglected\nin Eq. (31). (When expressed in terms of resonance functions, Eq. (33) agrees, after the\nnonrelativistic limit is taken, with the phase shift calculated in [4] up to overall factors.)\nTaking the low-frequency limit, we find that FLT S \u2248 \u22121. Thus, like \u2206\u03c6geo , \u2206\u03c6LT S has\nthe incorrect low-frequency limiting form. It also has a high-frequency behavior that is\n22\n\n\fdramatically different from either Fgeo or FGD , as can be seen in Fig. 2. In this limit, while\nFgeo \u223c 1/\u03c9T and FGD \u223c 1 (see appendix C), FLT S \u223c 1/(\u03c9T )2, and dies off much more\nrapidly. As pointed out in [1], this rapid die off is due to three effects. Firstly, the \u2206\u03c6LT S\ndoes not include the boundary terms at the mirror. These terms depend on the value of the\nvelocity of the atom at the surface of the mirror, and the length Lk /2, and they mitigate\nthis rapid decrease for \u2206\u03c6geo . Secondly, \u2206\u03c6LT S depends on v 2 , and is constant as the atom\ntravels through the interferometer, while \u2206\u03c6GD depends on the product xv, and increases\nlinearly with the distance the atom travels from the initial beam splitter. Thirdly, since\n\u2206\u03c6LT S depends only on v i v j hij , discontinuous jumps in the velocity due to the hard wall\nmirrors were not taken into account in \u2206\u03c6LT S . From appendix C, these hard-wall jumps\ncontribute directly to the high-frequency behavior of \u2206\u03c6GD .\n\nB.\n1.\n\nCalculations done at the quantum-field-theory level\nFor Spin 0 Fields\n\nCalculations of the phase shift at the quantum-field-therapy level were first done by\nCai and Papini [5]. Their starting point is the covariant version of the Ginzburg-Landau\nequation, but for a charged particle. This is a relativistic Klein-Gordon equation for a\nbosonic field \u03c6 that interacts with itself through a |\u03c6|4 interaction (Eq. (2.1) of [5]). By\nturning off the |\u03c6|4 interaction, and setting the charge of the particle to zero, one recovers\nLinet and Tourrenc's starting point. If one extracts the single-particle Hamiltonian from\nthis equation, and take the correspondence principle limit of the EOM, one recovers the\ngeodesic EOM used by Stodolsky. Thus, like Linet and Tourrenc, and Stodolsky, Cai and\nPapini work in TT coordinates.\nBy acting on \u03c6 with a phase operator \u03c7, Cai and Papini was able to solve for a general\nexpression for the phase shift due to gravitational effects in the weak-gravity limit through\na stationary-phase type of analysis. This operator has the form [Eq. (3.1) of [5]],\n\u001b\n\u001a\nI\nI\n1\n1\n\u03bb\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bb\n\u03b2\n,\n\u03c7= \u2212\ndz (\u0393\u03b1,\u03bb\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u03b2,\u03bb\u03b1 ) J +\ndz g\u03bb\u03b2 P\n4 \u03b3\n2 \u03b3\n\n(34)\n\n(using our notation) for a closed path where J\u03b1\u03b2 is the generator of Lorentz transformations,\nand P \u03b1 is the generator of translations. We have dropped the vector potential term since the\n23\n\n\fatoms we consider in this paper are not charged. As they mentioned, using Stokes' theorem\nthe first term in \u03c7 can be written as\n1\n\u2212\n4\n\nZ\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 J \u03b1\u03b2 d\u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(35)\n\nD\n\nin the weak-gravity limit; the integral is over the timeline surface D bounded by \u03b3, and\nd\u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd is a 2-form on D. This expression has been explicitly verified in [11] for the phase shift\ncaused by Riemann curvature tensor for a stationary spacetime.\nThe second term agrees with Stodolsky's expression for the phase shift. Indeed, Cai and\nPapini uses Eq. (34) to calculate the phase shift of a model interferometer due to the passage\nof a gravitational wave [Eq. (3.15) of [5]], and they found that up to terms of order (v/c)2,\nthe following holds:\n\"The \u2206\u03c72 terms in (3.15) agrees with Stodolsky's result [11] when a misprint in\nthe latter is corrected by inserting an overall factor 21 .\" (From page 415 of [5].)\nThe reference [11] cited above is the work by Stodolsky cited as [4] in this paper. Consequently, their expression for the phase shift, like Linet and Tourrenc's, and Stodolsky's,\nalso has the incorrect low-frequency limiting form. The effects of the mirrors on the test\nparticle's phase was not considered by them either.\n\n2.\n\nFor Spin 1/2 Fields\n\nBord\u00e9 and coworkers [6, 7, 8] considered the use of fermionic atoms in matter-wave interferometers to measure various gravitational effects, including the detection of gravitational\nwaves. Their starting point was the Dirac equation for a two-level, spin 1/2 atom expressed\nin curved spacetimes using the tetrad formalism. Similar to Cai and Papini, theirs was a\nHamiltonian-based approach, and they showed that the dominant contribution by the gravitational wave to the Hamiltonian is from a term with the form pi pj hij /2m, where m is\nthe mass of the atom, and pi its momentum [see Eq. (10) of [6]]. The other terms in the\nHamiltonian due to the gravitational wave are from very small spin-gravitation couplings.\nThese terms can be neglected here since we are dealing with atoms without spin. When\nthis is done, the Hamiltonian they calculated has the same form as Eq. (2) for the geodesic\nEOM, and is manifestly different from the Hamiltonian Eq. (17) for the geodesic deviation\nEOM. Thus they, too, worked in the TT coordinates.\n24\n\n\fAlthough an expression for the phase shift was not calculated in [6], they concluded the\nfollowing:\n\"The phase shift, that one can calculate from the first terms of Eq. (10), increases\nwith the velocity of the atoms in contrast with what happens in the inertial\nfield case and a gravitational wave detector using atomic interferometry should\ntherefore use relativistic atoms. In this case, it can be shown directly from Eq. (5)\nH\nthat the phase shift is proportional to h(\u00d7,+) ds/\u03bb where \u03bb is the atomic de\nBroglie wavelength, result which is similar to the optical case.\" (From page 161\nof [6].)\nIn a subsequent paper [8], Bord\u00e9 gave an explicit expression for the phase shift [see Eq. (98)\nof [8]]. It has, for its spin 0 component, the same expression, \u2206\u03c6LT S , for its phase shift as\nStodolsky's. Thus, like Stodolsky's approach, any phase shift calculated using this analysis\nwould have the incorrect low-frequency limiting form as well.\n\n3.\n\nMore General Analysis\n\nFinally, all of the analyses that we outlined in this paper were done in the weak-gravity\nlimit. In [9], a derivation of the phase shift of a quantum mechanical test particle was done\nwithout making this approximation. Their analysis was also based on the geodesic-EOM\napproach, and they arrived same expression for the phase shift that Stodolsky does for spin\n1/2 test particle with no approximations, while it holds only the first order in ~ for spin 0\nand spin 1 particles. Consequently, phase shifts calculated with their expression will also\nhave the same incorrect low-frequency limiting form as Stodolsky's.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThere has been a preference among those who study matter-wave interferometry and\ngravitational waves to use TT coordinates to analyze the phase shift of an interferometer\ninduced by gravitational waves instead of the proper reference frame. The expectation is that\nirrespective of which reference frame is used to calculate the phase shift, the final expression\nwill be the same [12, 23]. We have shown in this paper that for matter-wave interferometry\nthis expectation is wrong. By presenting a calculation of the phase shift using the TT\n25\n\n\fcoordinates following the line of the analysis found in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and\nalso a calculation of the phase shift using the proper reference frame following the analysis\nfound in [1, 2], we have shown that the expressions for the phase shift obtained using the TTcoordinates is different from that obtained using the proper reference frame. Moreover, we\nhave shown that the commonly accepted expression for the phase shift Eq. (31)-which is the\nend result of all previous derivations of the phase shift in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]-is\nincomplete, and gives yet a different expression for the phase shift of Fig. 1. This happens\neven though derivations of this expression were all done in TT coordinates.\nThe focus of this paper has been on demonstrating in detail that differences exist between\nthe various approaches to calculating the phase shift, and showing explicitly that different\nexpressions for the phase shift are obtained. To determine which one, if any, is correct, we\nnoted that in the limit of sufficiently low frequency gravitational waves, the correct expression\nfor the phase shift must reduce to the well known expression for the phase shift induced by a\nstatic curvature. It must therefore be proportional to components of the Riemann curvature\ntensor. This static phase shift can also be calculated within Newtonian gravity, where the\ncurvature is formed from gradients of the acceleration due to gravity g. The phase shift due\nto g has been measured [24, 25], and recently has been used to measure gradients in g as\nwell [26, 27, 28]. In addition, there are indications that the phase shift induced by the static\nRiemann curvature tensor has already been seen [28]. We have explicitly shown that when\nthe phase shift is calculated using the proper reference frame and geodesic deviation EOM,\nit has the expected limiting form in the low-frequency limit, and is therefore correct. The\nother two, both of which used the TT coordinates and the geodesic EOM, do not, and are\nthus incorrect.\nThe implications of this conclusion are immense. In [1, 2], MIGO, the M atter-wave\nI nterferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory, was proposed. The theoretical sensitivity\npredicted for MIGO was based on a calculation of its phase shift using the proper reference\nframe and the geodesic deviation EOM. The conclusion arrived at in these papers was that\nby using slow atoms, it would be possible to construct gravitational wave observatories that\nare as sensitive as LIGO or LISA (the Laser I nterferometer S pace Antenna), but would be\norders of magnitude smaller, and have a much broader frequency response. This conclusion\nis diametrically opposite from the conclusions arrived previous in the literature that fast\natoms-indeed, ultrarelativistic ones-should be used in the matter-wave interferometer\n26\n\n\finstead [6].\nThe conclusion that relativistic atoms should be used in the detection of gravitational\nwaves with matter-wave interferometers is the basis on which most of the atomic, molecular\nand optical physics community judges the suitability of using matter-wave interferometers\nas gravitational wave detectors. The physical origin of this conclusion by Bord\u00e9 and his\ncoworkers is the dependence of the phase shift \u2206\u03c6LT S on the square of the atom's velocity\nin the geodesic-EOM-based approach; clearly, the faster the atom, the larger the phase shift\nwill be. Even though our analysis of the phase shift was done for nonrelativistic atoms,\nwe note that if the size of the interferometer is held constant, and only the velocity of the\natom is increased, then in the high-velocity limit, T \u2192 0, and eventually \u03c9T << \u03c0/4 for the\nfrequency of gravitational waves expected from astrophysical sources. The high-velocity limit\nis thus equivalent to the low-frequency limit for the gravitational waves, and we have shown\nthat the low-frequency limit of \u2206\u03c6LT S is incorrect. Thus, Bord\u00e9 and coworker's assertion\nabout relativistic atoms being more suitable for the detection of gravitational waves is also\nincorrect.\nAll previous calculations and estimates of the phase shift in the literature also neglected\nthe effect the mirrors of the interferometer have on the phase shift. Indeed, from appendix\nC we see that it is precisely because hard wall mirrors are used-along with the instantaneous impulsive force that they exert on the atoms when they reflect off-that the use of\nslow-velocity atoms leads to a sensitivity that increases with frequency is obtained. This\ndependence on frequency is the exact opposite for LIGO and LISA [12], and is part of the\nreason that MIGO can be so much smaller than either one.\nWe have not, in this paper, presented the underlying physical reasons why the current\nTT coordinates approach to calculating the phase shift fails, and the proper reference frame\nsucceeds. We shall address this issue in detail later [34]. Here, we only note that one may\ntry to modify the boundary conditions for the atom on the mirrors so that the phase shift\ncalculated for Fig. 1 in TT coordinates will have the correct low-frequency limit. Doing this\nis especially tempting in light of the following statement by Thorne:\n\"However, errors are much more likely in the TT analysis than in the properreference-frame analysis, because our physical intuition about how experimental\napparatus behaves is proper-reference-frame based rather than TT-coordinate\nbased. As an example, we intuitively assume that if a microwave cavity is\n27\n\n\frigid, its walls will reside at fixed coordinate locations xj . This remains true\nin the detector's proper reference frame (aside from fractional changes of order (L2 /\u03bb2 )h, which are truly negligible if the detector is small and which the\nproper-reference-frame analysis ignores). But it is not true in TT coordinates;\nthere the coordinate locations of a rigid wall are disturbed by fractional amounts\nof order h, which are crucial in analyses of microwave-cavity-based gravity wave\ndetectors.\" (From page 400 of [12].)\nWe find that while it may be possible to suitably modify the boundary conditions to bring\n\u2206\u03c6geo in line with the low frequency limit, doing so will be ad hoc, and will not explain the\nunderlying physical reason for the differences between \u2206\u03c6geo and \u2206\u03c6GD . What is at the\nheart of the physics are not questions of which boundary conditions to take and how they\nshould be modified, but rather how measurement of physical quantities are made in general\nrelativity when the background metric varies with time.\nWhen doing an experiment to measure some physical property of a test particle-its\nphase shift, say-we start by choosing an origin for our coordinate system. It is natural\nto choose as this origin some point on our measuring apparatus, which in our case is the\ninitial beam splitter. In the three spatial dimensions, this origin is represented by a point\non a three-dimension space; this point is what we use when measurements with a physical\napparatus are actually made. If we wish to represent the origin in space and time, it would\nseem to be natural to represent it as an event in four-dimensional spacetime. Coordinate\nsystems constructed by doing so are called quasi-cartesian coordinate systems by Synge. He\nalso noted who also noted that a suitable choice of origin in spacetime for is often difficult\n(see section 10 of [17]), however. This is especially true in the case of gravitational waves,\nwhere the metric is nonstationary, and varies with time. In fact, by identifying the origin\nas an event, we have ignored the fact that our measuring apparatus is a physical object. It\ntoo must travel along a worldline in the spacetime, as will any test particle whose physical\nproperties we are measuring. As was argued in [18], only relative motions of a test particle\nwith respect to the apparatus can thus be measured. These arguments were based in part\non the following observation by Hawking and Ellis:\n\"In chapter 3 we saw that if the metric was static there was a relation between the\nmagnitude of the timelike Killing vector and the Newtonian potential. One was\n28\n\n\fable to tell whether a body was in a gravitational field by whether, if released\nfrom rest, it would accelerate with respect to the static frame defined by the\nKilling vector. However, in general, space-time will not have any Killing vectors.\nThus one will not have any special frame against which to measure acceleration;\nthe best one can do is to take two bodies close together and measure their relative\nacceleration [emphasis added].\" (From page 78 of [35].)\nThis relative motion is not measured in the TT coordinates where the coordinates are defined\nrelative to a fixed event, chosen as the origin, in the spacetime. The motion of the measuring\napparatus through spacetime was not taking into account in the TT coordinates, so that the\nbeam splitters and the mirrors are at fixed coordinate values. This relative motion, on the\nother hand, is measured in the proper reference frame where the coordinates are explicitly\nconstructed to span the distance between the measuring apparatus, and the test particle\nwhose properties are to be measured. The motion of the measuring apparatus has been\nbuilt in from the beginning, and indeed, the positions of the beam splitters and the mirrors\nshift during the passage of the gravitational wave. Failing to take into account the motion\nof the measuring apparatus in spacetime is the underlying physical reason why the wrong\nexpression was obtain for Fig. 1 when the TT coordinates are used.\nThese statements will be expanded upon, and justified in [34].\n\nAPPENDIX A: THE QUASI-CLASSICAL APPROXIMATION AND THE INTERFEROMETER\n\nIn this appendix we set the framework used in our different calculations of the phase\nshift.\n\n1.\n\nThe quasi-classical approximation\n\nLike Stodolsky [4, 9], we use the quasi-classical approximation to calculate the phase\nshift of an atom in a matter-wave interferometer. This approximation is the Lagrangian\nversion of the WKB, or stationary phase approximation, in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation\nof quantum mechanics. We assume that the density of particles through the interferometer\nis low enough that they do not interact with one another appreciably in the time it takes\n29\n\n\ffor the atom to traverse the interferometer. Within this approximation, the particles can\nbe treated as test particles that interact only with the gravitational wave, and not with\nthemselves. We can thus consider the phase shift of each atom individually, and use the\nFeynman path integral method to calculate its phase shift. However, instead of integrating\nover all possible paths, we make the quasi-classical approximation, and consider only the\nmost probable path-which is also the classical path-that the test particle takes through\nthe interferometer (see [36]). As a result,\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\ncl\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2248\nScl [xA , xB ; \u03b31 ] \u2212 S [xA , xB ; \u03b32] ,\n~\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere the superscript \"cl\" stands for \"classical\", and \u03b31 and \u03b32 are the two possible paths a\nclassical test particle can take through the interferometer that links a common point xA on\nthe interferometer (the initial beam splitter, say) to a common point xB on the interferometer\n(the final beam splitter, say). Note that Scl [xA , xB ; \u03b3] are functionals of the points xA and\nxB , along with the paths \u03b31 and \u03b32 connecting them.\nUnlike [4], as well as the calculations of the phase shift done in [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], we will\nwork in the nonrelativistic limit. The reason for doing so is two fold. First, the proper\nreference frame, as well as the general laboratory frame and all the other reference frames\nbased on the worldline of an observer, are constructed for nonrelativistic test particles.\nSecond, as is well known, the phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer is proportional to\nthe mass of the particle. This argues for the use of atoms in matter-wave interferometers\nto detect gravitational waves, as was proposed in [1, 2], and in any conceivable matter-wave\ninterferometer, these atoms will be moving nonrelativistically.\n\n2.\n\nThe interferometer\n\nThe configuration of the interferometer that we use in our calculations is shown in Fig. 1.\nDetails of this interferometer can be found in [1]. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note\nthat the interfering test particle in the interferometer is an atom with mass m. A beam\nof these atoms is emitted from an atomic source with velocity vs , and is beam-split into\ndifferent diffraction orders using a diffraction grating with periodicity a (see [38, 39, 40]).\nOnly the n = +1 and n = \u22121 diffraction orders are used in the interferometer.\nThere are two possible paths, denoted as n = +1 and n = \u22121 in Fig. 1, that any individual\n30\n\n\fatom can follow through the interferometer; it is not possible to tell a priori which of the\ntwo paths an atom will take. If the atom is diffracted into the n = +1 diffraction order, then\nimmediately after the beam splitter it will have a velocity of +v\u22a5 = 2\u03c0~/ma perpendicular\nto the longitudinal axis of the interferometer. Similarly, if an atom is diffracted into the\nn = \u22121 diffraction order, it will have a velocity of \u2212v\u22a5 (see Fig. 1). Since the diffraction\n2 1/2\ngrating does not impart energy to the atom, for both diffraction orders vk = (vs2 \u2212 v\u22a5\n) is\n\nthe velocity of the atom parallel to the axis of the interferometer immediately after it leaves\nthe beam splitter.\nIn [1, 2] the use of hard-wall, specular reflection mirrors was considered for the matterinterferometer. Mirrors of this type have been made from silicon wafers [37], and for near\nnormal and near glancing angles, the reflection from these mirrors is close to 100%. These\nare not the mirrors that are currently used in matter-wave interferometry, however. Mirrors based on diffraction gratings, standing waves of light, or stimulated Raman pulses are\nused instead [25, 27, 38, 39, 40]. We will nevertheless consider only the case of hard-wall\nmirrors in this paper, because of their simplicity. In the absence of gravitational waves, the\neffect of hard-wall mirrors, if they do not move, on the velocity of the atoms through the\ninterferometer is\nvx (out) = vx (in),\n\nvy (out) = \u2212vy (in),\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere ~v (in) and ~v (out) are, respectively, the velocity of the atom immediately before it is\nreflected off the mirror, and immediately afterwards.\n\nAPPENDIX B: THE TT GAUGE AND THE GENERAL LABORATORY\nFRAME\n\nIn this appendix we will show how the TT gauge can be taken in the general laboratory\nframe in a treatment that follows [18].\nLike the proper reference frame, the general laboratory frame is an orthonormal coordinate system fixed on the worldline of an observer. In our case it is fixed on the worldline\nof the initial beam splitter in Fig. 1. We choose a local tetrad eA \u03bc fixed on the observer's\nworldline. Thus, eA \u03bc eA\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd , while eA \u03bc eB\u03bd = \u03b7AB . In a slight break in the notation\nfollowed elsewhere in this paper, which follows the notational convention established in [12],\nwe use in this appendix the convention taken in [18]. Thus, we use as the tetrad indices\n31\n\n\fcapital Latin letters, which run from 0 to 3. Lower-case Latin letters are used as the spatial\ntetrad indices, and they run from 1 to 3. As usual, Greek letters are used for the spacetime\nindices of a general coordinate x\u03bc .\nConsider a the motion of a test particle P close to the observer O and her worldline. Let\nX A (\u03c4 ) be the position of P at any proper time \u03c4 in the observer's frame. X A (x) : x\u03bc \u2192 X A\ncan also be considered as a coordinate transformation from the general coordinates x\u03bc to\nthe tetrad frame at any time \u03c4 . Thus in a small neighborhood UO of O,\n\u2202X A\n\u03b7AB dX dX = \u03b7AB\n\u2202x\u03bc\nA\n\nso that\n\n\u2202X A\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\nB\n\n= eA \u03bc ,\n\n\u2202X B\n\u03bd\nUO \u2202x\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\u2202X A\n\nor\n\nUO\n\ndx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n\n(B1)\n\n= eA \u03bc .\n\n(B2)\n\nZ\n\n(B3)\n\nUO\n\nUO\n\nIntegrating Eq. (B2), we find for the spatial coordinates\nXa (\u03c4 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 (s )\n\u03b3\u03c7\n1\n\n\u03bc\n\nea\u03bc (\u03c4, s)\u03c7 (\u03c4, s)ds \u2261\n\u03c4 (0)\n\u03b3\u03c7\n\nea .\n\n\u03c4 (s)\n\u03b3\u03c7\n\nwhere eA = eA\u03bc dx\u03bc is a 1-form, and \u03b3\u03c7 is a space-like geodesic linking O to P at a given\nproper time \u03c4 of the observer. Next, after taking appropriate account of causality, the time\ncomponent is\n\u2032\n\nX0 (t) = \u2212 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 ) +\n\nZ\n\ne0 .\n\n(B4)\n\n\u03b3\u03c0 (\u03c3)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03c0 is a null-vector linking O at time \u03c4 \u2032 with P at time \u03c4 ; the difference \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 is the\ntransit time of a light pulse emitted by O, and scattered by P.\nIn the case of linearized gravity, g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd . It is straightforward to see that in terms\nof tetrads\neA\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc\n= \u03b4\u03bd \u2212 h\u03bd \u03b4A ,\n2\n\nand\n\nA\n\ne\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03bd A\n\u03bd\n= \u03b4\u03bc + h\u03bc \u03b4\u03bd .\n2\n\n(B5)\n\nThis choice is not unique. If one does a local Lorentz transformation LA \u00c3 on eA \u03bc , then\n\u03b7AB = LA \u00c3 LB\u00c3 while eA \u03bc = LA \u00c3 e\u00c3 \u03bc . This leaves g\u03bc\u03bd = eA\u03bc eA \u03bd = e\u00c3\u03bc e\u00c3 \u03bd invariant.\nThe usual derivation of the TT gauge makes use of a remnant of general coordinate\ntransformation invariance still left in the linearized-gravity limit of general relativity. If\nx\u03bc = x\u0303\u03bc + \u03be\u03bc where \u03be\u03bc is a 'small', arbitrary vector, then h\u03bc\u03bd transforms to\nh\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03be\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd \u03be\u03bc .\n\n32\n\n(B6)\n\n\fOne can choose \u03be\u03bc such that\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n\u2202 \u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\nh0\u03bc = 0,\n\n(B7)\n\ncan be chosen for GWs in Minkowski space. Doing so defines a specific coordinate system,\nwhich is called the TT coordinates in [12].\nThe TT gauge can also be implemented in the general laboratory frame as well. In terms\nof a tetrad frame, the linearized coordinate transformation Eq. (B6) induces a Lorentz\ntransformation on the tetrads such that e\u00c3 \u03bc = L\u00c3 A eB \u03bc , where\n\u00c3\n\nL\n\nA\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u00c3\n\u00c3\n=\u03b4 A+\n\u2202 \u03beA + \u2202A \u03be ,\n2\n\u00c3\n\n(B8)\n\nand \u2202A = e\u03bcA \u2202\u03bc . Like the TT coordinates, the TT gauge can also be realized, but now\nthrough the appropriate Lorentz transformation. From Eq. (B2), this in turn means we can\nchoose the TT gauge in the construction of the general laboratory frame as well.\n\nAPPENDIX C: THE HIGH-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n\nIn this appendix we consider the high-frequency limit of \u2206\u03c6GD .\nBecause of its dependence on three timescales, the analysis of the high-frequency limit\nof \u2206\u03c6GD is more involved than that for the low frequency limit. There are two cases to\nconsider. The simplest case is when the transit time of the atom through the interferometer\nis very long in comparison with the period of the gravitational wave, so that T >> 2\u03c0/\u03c9,\nbut \u03c9 << \u03c90 still. To the atom, the mirrors still do not move in response to the gravitational\nwave, but the atom will experience many oscillations of the gravitational wave as it traverses\nthe interferometer. In this limit the phase of the atom oscillates so fast that we would naively\nexpect the phase shift to average to zero. It does not do so, however. We instead find that\nFGD \u223c 1.\nThat \u2206\u03c6GD does not vanish in the limit of high-frequency gravitational waves is due to\naction of the mirrors on the atoms as they traverse through the interferometer. When the\natoms reflect of the mirrors, they impart a impulsive force on the atoms that is effectively\ninstantaneous [41]. The effect of this force is readily apparent from the discontinuity in vy\nacross the mirror in Eqs. (A2) and (7). Note in particular that the force is proportional\nto perturbed velocity v1y (tr + T \u22121 /2) of the atom caused by the gravitational wave, and is\n33\n\n\fdifferent depending on which path the atom travels through the interferometer, as can be\nseen from the force lines in Fig. 1. It is because of this net instantaneous force that \u2206\u03c6GD\ndoes not average to zero in the high-frequency limit.\nWhen, \u03c9 >> \u03c90 as well, the mirrors themselves oscillate rapidly as the atom traverses\nthe interferometer. This rapid motion of the mirror is not correlated with the motion of the\natoms through the interferometer, however. When the atom reaches the mirror, roughly half\nthe time it will be moving in the same direction as the mirror, which would, from Eq. (18),\ntend to decelerate the atom. The other half of the time it will be moving in the opposite\ndirection as the mirror, and would tend to accelerate the atom. Not surprising, in this limit\nthe resonance function decreases by a half, and FGD \u2248 1/2.\nIn this high-frequency limit \u2206\u03c6GD is not proportional to R0x0y . There is no reason to\nexpect it to be, as there was in the low-frequency limit, however. Because the mirrors exert\na net force-which itself is the result of the passage of the gravitational wave through the\nsystem-on the atom as it passes through the interferometer, \u2206\u03c6GD \u223c \u0393x0y .\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nADS and RYC were supported by a grant from the Office of Naval Research.
