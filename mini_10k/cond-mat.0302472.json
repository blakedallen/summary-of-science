We interpret this unusual behaviour as the consequence of the\ntwo features characterising the hydrophobic polyelectrolytes: the pearl necklace conformation\nof the chains and the anomalously strong reduction of the effective charge fraction.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 Polyelectrolytes are polymers containing ionisable groups which, in a\npolar solvent like water, dissociate into charges tied to the polymer backbone and counter-ions\nspread in the solution. Polyelectrolytes are called hydrophobic when water is a poor solvent\nfor the backbone. Their single chain properties (conformation and effective charge density)\nare very different from those of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes. Theories [1,2,3], simulations [4,5]\nand experiments [6, 7] are all consistent with a pearl-necklace description of the single chain\nwhere low dielectric constant nanoregions (the pearls) are connected by narrow elongated\nstrings. Another important feature is the charge renormalisation. By osmometry Essafi et al.\nmeasured the effective charge fraction fef f as a function of the chemical charge fraction f for\npartially sulfonated polystyrene (PSS) [8]. In a range of charge fractions where hydrophilic\npolyelectrolytes followed rather well the so-called Manning-Oosawa condensation theory [9,10],\nthey found for PSS a further strong reduction of fef f [11].\nWhat happens for a large number of interacting chains in solution is still a largely open\nquestion. Indeed in the framework of the theoretical pearl-necklace model two semi-dilute\n(\u2217 ) Present address: Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, Orsay, France\n(\u2217\u2217 ) E-mail: claudine.williams@college-de-france.fr\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nTable I \u2013 PSS samples of various chain lengths N , chemical charge fractions f and effective charge\nfractions fef f . fef f is calculated from f according to [11]\nN\n120\n410\n410\n410\n410\n\nf (%)\n34\n39\n56\n71\n91\n\nfef f (%)\n3.4\n5.8\n14\n21\n31\n\nN\n1320\n1320\n1320\n1320\n\nf (%)\n36\n53\n71\n91\n\nfef f (%)\n4.3\n12\n21\n31\n\nN\n2520\n2520\n2520\n5800\n5800\n\nf (%)\n37\n54\n89\n57\n90\n\nfef f (%)\n4.8\n13\n30\n14\n30\n\nregimes have been predicted [3]. As long as the pearl size is much smaller than the correlation length \u03be which characterises the transient network of overlapping chains, a classical\n\u22121/2\npolyelectrolyte behaviour is expected, i.e. \u03be \u223c Cp\nwhere Cp is the polymer concentration\n(string-controlled regime). However when the pearl size becomes of the order of \u03be, a transition\n\u22121/3\nto \u03be \u223c Cp\nis predicted (bead-controlled regime). Experimentally two regimes have only\nbeen observed for an atypical polyelectrolyte soluble in polar solvents other than water, the\nscaling exponents being -1/2 and -1/7 respectively [12]. For the model hydrophobic polyelectrolyte PSS in water, Essafi et al. found by Small Angle Scattering measurements (SAXS\nand SANS) that the position of the so called polyelectrolyte peak, q \u2217 , which is a measure of\nthe inverse of \u03be, scaled as q \u2217 \u223c Cp\u03b1 in the whole Cp range with \u03b1 depending qualitatively on\nf [8, 13, 14]. This behaviour was later observed for more complex systems like concentrated\npolyelectrolyte stars [15]. On the other hand, using thin film balance technique, Th\u00e9odoly\net al. measured the wavelength \u03bb of the oscillating disjoining pressure isotherms of various\npolyelectrolytes confined in thin liquid films [16]. They found for hydrophobic PSS the same\n\u22121/2\nconcentration dependence as for hydrophilic polyelectrolytes: \u03bb \u223c Cp\n.\nIn such an unclear situation it seemed essential to measure systematically the correlation\nlength as a function of f , chain length N and Cp . For this purpose well defined model\nhydrophobic polyelectrolytes, PSS's, have been prepared [17] and \u03be has been measured by two\ndifferent techniques: SAXS for a classical measurement in reciprocal space and Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (AFM) in real space. In the SAXS experiment \u03be has been taken as 2\u03c0/q \u2217 where\nq \u2217 is the position of the polyelectrolyte peak. AFM has been used to provide force-distance\nmeasurements of the polyelectrolyte solution confined in a sphere-plane geometry. The period\nd of this oscillating force has been assumed to be a direct measurement of \u03be.\nExperimental details. \u2013 Well defined monodisperse (MW /MN < 1.3) PSS's (poly(styreneco-styrene sulfonate, sodium salt) of various chemical charge fractions f and chain lengths N\n(Table I) have been prepared and characterised according to a method described elsewhere [17].\nSalt-free water was produced by a milli-Q system (Millipore co.) feeded with triply-distilled\nwater. PSS solutions were prepared by weight and left under stirring for a few days in airtight\nplastic bottles before use.\nFor the SAXS experiments cylindrical capillaries of 2 mm internal diameter were filled\nwith the PSS solutions and sealed by Teflon tape. Measurements were performed at the\nEuropean Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) on BM26 beamline. We\nused the highly monochromatic (\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) X-ray beam at \u03bb = 0.124 nm (10.0 keV).\nThe detector was a 1D quadrant gas-filled detector situated at 7.8 m from the sample. The\nscattering vectors q (q = 4\u03c0/\u03bb sin(\u03b8/2), \u03b8 is the scattering angle) ranged from 0.1 to 0.9 nm\u22121 .\nForce-Distance measurements were carried out using a commercial Atomic Force Micro-\n\n\fD.

We used the colloidal probe technique [18] in which the usual sharp AFM tip\nwas replaced by a colloidal silica particle of 7 \u03bcm diameter(Bangs Laboratories Inc.) that was\nglued to a tipless cantilever (\u03bcMash, CsC12). Clean silicon wafers (Wacker, Germany) were\nused as substrates. Particles glued to the cantilevers were cleaned directly before the measurement by plasma cleaning for 20 minutes (Plasma cleaner PDC-32G, Harrick Scientific, USA).\nThen a drop of the PSS solution was put onto the substrate and the probing head (the silica\nparticle) was also immersed in the solution. Force-distance curves were obtained at a pulling\nfrequency of 0.2 Hz, corresponding to piezo speed from 200 nm/s to 800 nm/s, depending\non the range of the pulling distance. Variation of the pulling speed in this range showed no\nchange in force-distance data. For each solution, the force-distance curves were measured at\n3-5 different locations on the same substrate as well as on 2-4 different substrates.\nResults and discussion. \u2013 A series of typical SAXS spectra I(q) are presented in fig. 1\nfor salt-free solutions of PSS as a function of f , all other parameters remaining constant. One\nnotes the presence of the classical broad maximum also called the polyelectrolyte peak. In\nthe case of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes in salt-free water, it is independent of f as long as f\nis above the onset of the Manning-Ooasawa condensation (about 35% in the case of vinylic\npolyelectrolytes) [19]. Here the situation is very different. When f decreases, i.e. when the\nhydrophobicity increases, this broad maximum becomes sharper, more intense and the maximum moves to smaller q values. In other terms the characteristic correlation length 2\u03c0/q \u2217\nincreases (in this example from 11.4 nm to 18.3 nm) with fluctuations decreasing. Assuming\nthat the correlation length is related to an inter-chain electrostatic repulsion, its size should\nbe of the order of the Debye screening length \u03bbD . In salt-free solutions electrostatic screening\ncomes from the residual ions in water (on the order of 10\u22125 M) and the free polyelectrolyte\ncounter-ions at a concentration Cp fef f . In our experimental conditions the former contribution can be neglected and we have:\n\u03bbD \u2243 (\n\ne2\nCp fef f NA )\u22121/2\n\u01ebkB T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, \u01eb the dielectric constant of water, kB the Boltzman constant,\nT the temperature and NA the Avogadro number. fef f has been calculated from f assuming\nthat the empirical renormalisation law established by Essafi et al. [11] is valid here. 2\u03c0/q \u2217 is\nplotted in fig. 2 as a function of \u03bbD for all PSS samples. For clarity of presentation points\nhave been grouped in four average charge fractions hf i: 35%, 55%, 70% and 90%. First of\nall 2\u03c0/q \u2217 is an increasing function of \u03bbD . This means that the solution is organised on a\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n35\n30\n2\u03c0/q*, nm\n\n25\n20\n\n<f> = 35 %\n<f> = 55 %\n<f> = 70 %\n<f> = 90 %\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8\n10\nDebye length, nm\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 SAXS correlation length 2\u03c0/q\u2217 versus Debye length \u03bbD for various PSS (see Table) grouped\nhere in four average charge fractions hf i. The straight line represents the classical behaviour in the\ncase of model hydrophilic polyelectrolytes: 2\u03c0/q \u2217 \u223c \u03bbD .\n\nlength scale of the order of the screening length; therefore it is strongly related to the free\ncounter-ion concentration. This confirms indirectly that the anomalously strong reduction of\nfef f observed in the dilute regime [11] also occurs in this moderately concentrated regimes.\nHowever the proportionality between 2\u03c0/q \u2217 and \u03bbD is only observed at the highest charge\nfraction (hf i = 90%). In this case PSS behaves as a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte in the semi1/2\ndilute regime and obeys the expected scaling law: 2\u03c0/q \u2217 \u223c \u03bbD \u223c Cp . Then when hf i\n\u2217\ndecreases and hydrophobicity increases, 2\u03c0/q progressively deviates from the hydrophilic\nbehaviour (\u03be proportional to \u03bbD , the straight line in fig. 2). This means that for hydrophobic\npolyelectrolytes the solution structure is not solely controlled by electrostatic interactions. It\ndepends also on the hydrophobicity of the chain and conformational properties will have to\nbe taken into account.\nIn order to ascertain that the observed deviation from the classical hydrophilic polyelectrolyte behaviour was not due to some artifacts of the SAXS technique [20], we have also\nmeasured \u03be by AFM. Following the pioneering work of Milling with fully charged PSS [21],\nwe have analyzed the force distance curve of various hydrophobic PSS solutions confined in\nthe sphere-plane geometry. The polymers were the same as those used for the SAXS measurements for one chain length only (N = 410). Oscillatory forces were systematically observed\nand their characterisation will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper. We focus here\non d, the period of oscillation, which has been shown to be the characteristic length of the\nsolution structure in real space [22, 23]. The comparison between d measured by AFM and\n2\u03c0/q \u2217 as measured by SAXS is presented in fig. 3. The two techniques are in remarkable\nagreement and within experimental errors we have found:\nd = 1.05\n\n2\u03c0\n+ 1.2 nm\nq\u2217\n\n(2)\n\nA detailed comparison between the techniques will be presented elsewhere.\nWithin this experimental framework we have then systematically measured \u03be as a function\nof N , f , and Cp . The classical logarithmic plot q \u2217 as a function of Cp is presented in figure 4\nfor chain lengths ranging from 120 to 5800 monomers and various f per chain length. First\nthere is clearly no dependence on N as expected for semi-dilute solutions of overlapping chains.\nHowever there is a strong influence of f even though these polymers are highly charged strong\npolyelectrolytes with f above the onset of Manning-Oosawa condensation (f \u2265 35%).

This behaviour is\nonly observed for the highest charge fraction (at hf i = 90% we have q \u2217 \u223c Cp0.46 ) i.e. only\nwhen PSS almost behaves as a model hydrophilic polyelectrolyte. When f decreases, the linear\ndensity of hydrophobic moieties along the chain (styrene monomer) increases and the intrinsic\nhydrophobicity of the backbone is enhanced. The consequence is a progressive deviation\n1/3\ntowards q \u2217 \u223c Cp at the lowest f (hf i = 35%). Having a Cp exponent different from 1/2\nis highly unusual for polyelectrolyte and this clearly results from hydrophobic effects. In the\n1/2\nframework of the pearl-necklace model two limit behaviours have been predicted (q \u2217 \u223c Cp\n1/3\nin the string-controlled regime and q \u2217 \u223c Cp in the bead controlled regime) on each side\nof a crossover occurring when the pearl size becomes of the order of \u03be.

Filled points are from SAXS, empty points from AFM and the star is reported from recent\nsimulation [5]. The line connects (f = 35%; \u03b1 = 1/3) to (f = 100%; \u03b1 = 1/2). PSS at f = 100% was\na commercial sample purchased from Fluka and dialyzed prior to measurement.\n\ntransition has never been observed. However it may appear out of the Cp range that is narrow\nin this study [24].

It has been\ndetermined by SAXS and using AFM as well (the oscillation period that is a measure of \u03be\nscales as: d \u223c Cp\u2212\u03b1 ). Both techniques show that \u03b1 depends on f and continuously decreases\nfrom \u03b1 = 0.50 at f = 100% to reach \u03b1 = 0.33 at f = 35%. At f = 100% PSS behaves as a\nhydrophilic polyelectrolyte and obeys the classical power law for hydrophilic polyelectrolytes\n\u22121/2\nin the semi-dilute regime \u03be \u223c Cp\n. At the lowest charge fraction (f = 35%), PSS is very hydrophobic and is thus in very poor solvent condition. The chains are compact, slightly charged\n(fef f = 3 \u2212 5%) globules that electrostatically repel each other. In this case we thus have\n\u22121/3\n\u03be \u223c Cp\n. The two limit exponents 1/2 and 1/3 can be physically interpreted: a hydrophilic\npolyelectrolyte behaviour when fully charged and a self repelling colloidal organisation at very\nlow f . The intermediate situation when \u03b1 differs from 1/3 or 1/2 is very delicate to interpret\nand it has never been predicted by any theory. However very recently Limbach et al. made\nmolecular-dynamics simulations on strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvent which is\nthe situation of PSS in water. At f=50%, they found that the position of the peak in the\nstructure factor scaled as: q \u2217 \u223c Cp0.35 for all investigated Cp [5]. This value for \u03b1 is reported\nin fig. 5. Their result is in quantitative agreement with the continuous transition that we have\nexperimentally observed.\nConclusion. \u2013 The correlation length \u03be of well defined hydrophobic polyectrolyte has\nbeen determined using two very different techniques: SAXS and AFM. \u03be obeys a general\n\n\fD.

Contrary to the case of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes, \u03b1 depends\nstrongly on f , decreasing from 1/2 at f = 100% to 1/3 at f = 35% in the vicinity of the\nsolubility limit.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nWe are grateful to T.
