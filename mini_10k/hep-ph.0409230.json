The main reason is that neutrino oscillations is a consequence of the existence of neutrino\nmasses, as was discovered by Bruno Pontecorvo in the late 50's [1, 2, 3]. However, neutrinos are massless in the\nGlashow-Salam-Weinberg Standard Model [4, 5, 6]. Hence, neutrino oscillations represents an open window on\nthe physics beyond the Standard Model.\nIn view of such importance of neutrino oscillations, it is necessary to have a correct and clear understanding of all\naspects of the theory of neutrino oscillations, in order to have a correct interpretation of experimental results. The\ntheory of neutrino oscillations has been discussed in many papers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and reviewed in [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]\n(conference contributions and papers with other points of view are listed in Ref. [45]).\nIn this report we first review briefly the standard plane-wave theory of neutrino oscillations in Section 2. In\nSection 3 we discuss the problem of the definition of flavor neutrino states and in Section 4 we show that the flavor\nneutrino states are appropriate for the description of neutrinos produced or detected in charged-current weakinteraction processes. In Section 5 we present a covariant derivation of the probability of neutrino oscillations. In\nSection 6 we try to give clear answers to three questions which are often asked. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.\n\n2 Standard Plane-Wave Theory\nNeutrino oscillations are a consequence of neutrino mixing: the left-handed flavor neutrino fields \u03bd\u03b1L , with \u03b1 =\ne, \u03bc, \u03c4 , are unitary linear combinations of the massive neutrino fields1) \u03bdkL , with k = 1, 2, 3,\n\u03bd\u03b1L =\n\n3\nX\n\nU\u03b1k \u03bdkL\n\n(\u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere U is the unitary mixing matrix.\nIn the standard plane-wave theory of neutrino oscillations [7, 8, 9, 10, 37] it is assumed that the neutrinos created\n1) For simplicity we consider the simplest case of three-neutrino mixing, neglecting the possible existence of additional sterile neutrino fields\n(see Refs. [46, 47, 48, 49]).\n\n\for detected together with a charged antilepton2) l+\n\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , are described by the flavor neutrino state\n|\u03bd\u03b1 i =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2217\nU\u03b1k\n|\u03bdk i .\n\nk=1\n\n(2.2)\n\nSince the massive neutrino states |\u03bdk i have definite mass mk and definite energy Ek , they evolve in time as plane\nwaves:\n\u2202\n|\u03bdk (t)i = H |\u03bdk (t)i = Ek |\u03bdk (t)i =\u21d2 |\u03bdk (t)i = e\u2212iEk t |\u03bdk i ,\n(2.3)\ni\n\u2202t\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian operator and |\u03bdk i = |\u03bdk (t = 0)i. The consequent time evolution of the flavor\nneutrino state (2.2) is given by\n!\n3\n3\nX\nX\nX\n\u2217\n\u2212iEk t\n\u2217\n\u2212iEk t\n|\u03bd\u03b1 (t)i =\nU\u03b1k e\n|\u03bdk i =\n(2.4)\nU\u03b1k e\nU\u03b2k |\u03bd\u03b2 i ,\nk=1\n\n\u03b2=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nk=1\n\nwhich shows that if the mixing matrix U is different from unity (i.e. if there is neutrino mixing), for t > 0 the state\n|\u03bd\u03b1 (t)i, which has pure flavor \u03b1 at t = 0, is a superposition of different flavors. The quantity in round parentheses\nin Eq. (2.4) is the amplitude of \u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 transitions at the time t after \u03bd\u03b1 production, whose squared absolute value\ngives the probability of a \u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 transitions:\n2\n\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (t) = |h\u03bd\u03b2 |\u03bd\u03b1 (t)i| =\n\n3\nX\n\n2\n\u2217\nU\u03b1k\n\ne\n\n\u2212iEk t\n\nU\u03b2k\n\nk=1\n\n=\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u2212i(Ek \u2212Ej )t\ne\n.\nU\u03b2k U\u03b1j U\u03b2j\nU\u03b1k\n\n(2.5)\n\nk,j=1\n\nOne can see that P\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (t) depends on the energy differences Ek \u2212 Ej . In the standard theory of neutrino\noscillations it is assumed that all massive neutrinos have the same momentum ~p. Since detectable neutrinos are\nultrarelativistic3), we have\nEk =\n\nq\nm2\n~p2 + m2k \u2243 E + k\n2E\n\n=\u21d2\n\nEk \u2212 Ej =\n\n\u2206m2kj\n,\n2E\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere E \u2261 |~p| is the energy of a massless neutrino (or, in other words, the neutrino energy in the massless approximation), and \u2206m2kj \u2261 m2k \u2212 m2j . In order to obtain a measurable flavor transition probability, it is necessary to\nconvert the time t, which is not measured in neutrino oscillation experiments, in the known source-detector distance L. Considering ultrarelativistic neutrinos, we have t \u2243 L, leading to the standard formula for the oscillation\nprobability\n!\n3\nX\n\u2206m2kj L\n\u2217\n\u2217\n,\n(2.7)\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L) =\nU\u03b1k U\u03b2k U\u03b1j U\u03b2j exp \u2212i\n2E\nk,j=1\n\nwhich is used in the analyses of the experimental data on neutrino oscillations in vacuum.\nSummarizing, there are three main assumptions in the standard theory of neutrino oscillations:\n(A1) Neutrinos produced or detected in charged-current weak interaction processes are described by the flavor\nstates (2.2).\n(A2) The massive neutrino states |\u03bdk i in Eq. (2.2) have the same momentum.\n(A3) The propagation time is equal to the distance L traveled by the neutrino between production and detection.\n\n3 Flavor Neutrino States\nThe flavor neutrino states which describe neutrinos produced or detected in charged-current weak interaction processes can be derived in the framework of Quantum Field Theory [32, 36, 42]. The final state |f i in an interaction\nprocess is given by\n|f i = S |ii ,\n(3.1)\n2) Since\n\n\u03b1 is an index, we use the notation le = e, l\u03bc = \u03bc, l\u03c4 = \u03c4 .\nis known that neutrino masses are smaller than about one eV (see Refs. [48, 50]). Since only neutrinos with energy larger than about 100\nkeV can be detected (see the discussion in Ref. [32]), in oscillation experiments neutrinos are always ultrarelativistic.\n3) It\n\n2\n\n\fwhere |ii is the initial state and S is the S-matrix operator. In general, the final state can be a superposition of\northogonal states,\n3\nX\n|f i =\nAk |fk i ,\n(3.2)\nk=1\n\nwith hfk |fj i = \u03b4kj . From Eq. (3.1) it follows that the amplitudes Ak are given by\nAk = hfk |f i = hfk | S |ii .\n\n(3.3)\n\nTurning now to the case of neutrinos, for definiteness let us consider neutrino production in the general decay\nprocess\nPI \u2192 PF + l+\n(3.4)\n\u03b1 + \u03bd\u03b1 ,\n\nwhere PI is the decaying particle, PF is a decay product (which can be absent, for example in \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ + \u03bd\u03bc ),\nand \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 . Other production processes, as well as detection processes, can be treated in a similar way with\nstraightforward modifications to the formalism. The final state of PI decay,\n|f i = S |PI i ,\n\n(3.5)\n\n|f i = N\u03b1 |\u03bd\u03b1 , l+\n\u03b1 , PF i + . . . ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nis given by\nwhere N\u03b1 is a normalization coefficient and the dots represents other decay channels and the undecayed initial\nstate PI itself. The state |\u03bd\u03b1 , l+\n\u03b1 , PF i can be decomposed in a superposition of orthogonal states corresponding to\ndifferent massive neutrinos:\n3\n1 X\nA\u03b1k |\u03bdk , l+\n(3.7)\n|\u03bd\u03b1 , l+\n\u03b1 , PF i ,\n\u03b1 , PF i =\nN\u03b1\nk=1\n\nwith the amplitudes A\u03b1k given by\n\n+\nA\u03b1k = h\u03bdk , l+\n\u03b1 , PF |f i = h\u03bdk , l\u03b1 , PF | S |PI i .\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe normalization of the state (3.7) requires that\n|N\u03b1 |2 =\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n|A\u03b1k |2 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nIt is convenient to write Eq. (3.7) in the form\n|PF , l+\n\u03b1 i |\u03bd\u03b1 i\n\n=\n\n|PF , l+\n\u03b1i\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n2\n\n|A\u03b1k |\n\n!\u22121/2\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\nA\u03b1k |\u03bdk i ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich shows that the final neutrino in the decay (3.4) is described by the flavor state\n|\u03bd\u03b1 i =\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n2\n\n|A\u03b1k |\n\n!\u22121/2\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\nA\u03b1k |\u03bdk i ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhich is calculable through Eq. (3.8). This flavor state has the same structure as the standard one in Eq.

Since in all neutrino oscillation experiments the approximation\n(3.17) is valid, in neutrino oscillations flavor neutrinos are correctly described by the standard flavor states (2.2),\nconfirming the validity of the standard assumption (A1). Let us emphasize that the validity of this approximation\nis very important, because the standard flavor states (2.2) do not depend on the kinematics of the process in which\nthe flavor neutrino is created or detected. Hence, it is possible to derive a general expression for the oscillation\nprobability, as we will see in Section 5.\n\n4 Neutrino Production and Detection\nIn this Section we show that the flavor states (3.11) are appropriate for the description of neutrinos produced or\ndetected in charged-current weak interaction processes. We consider for simplicity only the decay process (3.4),\nbut the same reasoning can be applied with straightforward modifications to any production or detection process.\nIt is well known [51, 52, 53, 54, 55] that the probability of the decay (3.4) is the sum of the decay probabilities\nin the different massive neutrinos \u03bdk weighted by the squared absolute value |U\u03b1k |2 of the element of the mixing\nmatrix that weights the contribution of \u03bdk to the charged-current weak interaction Hamiltonian (3.13). The reason\nis that the massive neutrinos have definite kinematical properties and constitute the possible orthogonal asymptotic\nstates of the decay. In other words, each decay in a massive neutrino constitutes a possible decay channel. Hence,\nthe probability of the decay (3.4) is given by\n|A\u03b1 |2 =\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n|U\u03b1k |2 |M\u03b1k |2 ,\n\nwith M\u03b1k given by Eq. (3.15).\n4\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fLet us now check that the description of the neutrino \u03bd\u03b1 produced in the decay (3.4) through the flavor state (3.11)\ngives the correct result (4.1). Indeed, the amplitude of the decay process (3.4) is given by\nb\nA\u03b1 = h\u03bd\u03b1 , l+\n\u03b1 , PF | S |PI i =\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n|A\u03b1k |2\n\n!\u22121/2\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\nA\u2217\u03b1k h\u03bdk , l+\n\u03b1 , PF |S|PI i =\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n|A\u03b1k |2\n\n!1/2\n\n.\n\n(4.2)\n\nTherefore, the decay probability is given by an incoherent sum of the probabilities of production of different\nmassive neutrinos: using Eq. (3.14) we obtain\n|A\u03b1 |2 =\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\n|A\u03b1k |2 = |U\u03b1k |2 |M\u03b1k |2 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nin agreement with Eq. (4.1). Thus, the coherent character of the flavor state (3.11) is correctly irrelevant for the\ndecay rate.\nIt is important to understand that this result is very important for the interpretation of the data of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments, because in the analysis of these data it is necessary not only to calculate the oscillation probability\nbut also the neutrino production and detection rates. We have shown that both tasks can be accomplished in a\nconsistent framework with the description of the produced and detected neutrinos through the flavor states (3.11).\n\n5 Covariant Plane Wave Neutrino Oscillations\nSince flavor is a Lorentz-invariant quantity (for example, an electron is an electron in any reference frame), the\nprobability of neutrino oscillations is Lorentz invariant [29, 35]. Indeed, the standard oscillation probability formula (2.7) is Lorentz-invariant, as shown in Ref. [35]. However, the standard derivation of the oscillation probability reviewed in Section 2 is not formulated in a covariant way. In this Section we present a covariant derivation\nof the oscillation probability which shows explicitly its Lorentz-invariance [29, 36, 42, 56, 57, 58].\nIn the following derivation we consider ultrarelativistic neutrinos. Of course, neutrinos are not ultrarelativistic in\nall reference frames4) . However, since the oscillation probability is Lorentz-invariant, it can be evaluated in any\nframe and we can choose to evaluate it in a frame where the massive neutrinos are ultrarelativistic. Let us emphasize\nthat this is not a peculiar choice, because there is a continuous infinite set of reference frames in which massive\nneutrinos are ultrarelativistic, which includes the one in which the detector is at rest. Indeed, we will always\nwork with explicitly Lorentz-invariant expressions for the oscillation probability, because these expressions must\nbe valid in the continuous infinite set of reference frames in which massive neutrinos are ultrarelativistic.\nThe amplitude of \u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 transitions at a distance L and after a time T from the production of the flavor neutrino\n\u03bd\u03b1 is given by\nA\u03b1\u03b2 (L, T ) = h\u03bd\u03b2 |e\u2212iET +iP L |\u03bd\u03b1 i ,\n(5.1)\nwhere E and P are, respectively, the energy and momentum operators. Since the massive neutrinos have definite\nmasses and kinematical properties, using the flavor states (2.2), which are valid for ultrarelativistic neutrinos, we\nobtain\n3\nX\n\u2217\nA\u03b1\u03b2 (L, T ) =\nU\u03b1k\nU\u03b2k e\u2212iEk T +ipk L ,\n(5.2)\nk=1\n\nwith\n\nEk =\n\nq\np2k + m2k .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe oscillation amplitude (5.2) is explicitly Lorentz-invariant. Let us notice that we do not adopt the standard\nassumption (A2) of equal momentum for different massive neutrinos. Indeed, it can be shown that in general\nmassive neutrinos do not have neither equal momenta nor equal energies [29, 30, 33, 33]. However, in spite of the\nunrealistic character of the standard assumption (A2) we will see that the standard expression for the oscillation\nprobability is correct.\nIn oscillation experiments the neutrino propagation time T is not measured. As in the standard plane-wave theory\nreviewed in Section 2, for ultrarelativistic neutrinos it is possible to approximate T \u2243 L (assumption (A3)) in the\nphase in Eq. (5.2). The reason is that in reality neutrinos are described by wave packets [11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23,\n4) We\n\nare grateful to Prof. D. V. Ahluwalia-Khalilova for asking by e-mail a stimulating question on this point.\n\n5\n\n\f24, 25, 28, 31, 32, 33, 36, 43], which are localized on the production process at the production time and propagate\nbetween the production and detection processes with a group velocity which is close to the velocity of light. If\nthe massive neutrinos are ultrarelativistic and contribute coherently to the detection process, their wave packets\noverlap with the detection process for an interval of time [T \u2212 \u2206T , T + \u2206T ], with\n!\nL\nm2\n,\n\u2206T \u223c \u03c3x ,\n(5.4)\nT = \u2243L 1+\nv\n2E 2\nwhere v is the average group velocity, m2 is the average of the squared neutrino masses, and \u03c3x is given by the\nspatial uncertainties of the production and detection processes summed in quadrature [25] (the spatial uncertainty\nof the production process determines the size of the massive neutrino wave packets). The correction Lm2 /2E 2\nto T = L in Eq. (5.4) can be neglected, because it gives corrections to the oscillation phases which are of higher\norder in the very small ratios m2k /E 2 . The corrections due to \u2206T \u223c \u03c3x are also negligible, because in all realistic\n2\nexperiments \u03c3x is much smaller than the oscillation length Losc\nkj = 4\u03c0E/\u2206mkj , otherwise oscillations could not\nbe observed [12, 14, 33, 43]. One can summarize these arguments by saying that the approximation T \u2243 L is\ncorrect because the phase of the oscillations is practically constant over the interval of time in which the massive\nneutrino wave packets overlap with the detection process.\nUsing the approximation T \u2243 L the phase in Eq. (5.2) becomes\n\u2212Ek T + pk L \u2243 \u2212 (Ek \u2212 pk ) L = \u2212\n\nEk2 \u2212 p2k\nm2k\nm2\nL=\u2212\nL \u2243 \u2212 k L,\nEk + pk\nEk + pk\n2E\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere E is the neutrino energy neglecting mass contributions. Let us emphasize that both the left and right hand\nsides of Eq. (5.5) are Lorentz-invariant [35].\nInserting the expression (5.5) in Eq. (5.2) one can obtain in a straightforward way a probability of \u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2\ntransitions in space which coincides with the standard one in Eq. (2.7). Therefore, the result of the covariant\nderivation of the oscillation probability confirms the correctness of the standard formula in Eq. (2.7).\nIt is important to notice that Eq. (5.5) shows that the phases of massive neutrinos relevant for the oscillations are\nindependent from the particular values of the energies and momenta of different massive neutrinos [14, 29, 30, 33,\n56], because of the relativistic dispersion relation (5.3). Hence, as remarked above, the standard assumption (A2) of\nequal momenta for different massive neutrinos, albeit unrealistic, is irrelevant for the correctness of the oscillation\nprobability.\n\n6 Questions\nIn this section we try to clarify the negative answers to three questions which are often asked.\n\n6.1 Do Charged Leptons Oscillate? No!\nIn order to understand the negative answer to this question it is important to comprehend that the only characteristic\nwhich distinguishes different charged leptons is their mass. Thus, flavor is distinguished through the mass of the\ncorresponding charged lepton or, in other words, flavor and mass coincide for charged leptons. Since for charged\nleptons there is no mismatch between flavor and mass, there cannot be flavor oscillations of charged leptons [29].\nIn Refs. [59, 60, 61] it has been claimed that the probability to detect a charged lepton oscillates in space-time. This\nclaim has been refuted in Ref. [22]. A similar effect, called \"Lambda oscillations\", which has been claimed to exist\n[62, 63] for the \u039b's produced together with a neutral kaon, as in the process \u03c0 \u2212 + p \u2192 \u039b + K 0 , has been refuted\nin Refs. [26, 64]. Considering the pion decay process \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , the authors of Refs. [59, 60, 61, 65] argued\nthat, since the final state of the muon and antineutrino is entangled, if the probability to detect the antineutrino\noscillates as a function of distance, also the probability to detect the muon must oscillate. However, it is well\nknown that the probability to detect the antineutrino, irrespective of its flavor, does not oscillate. This property is\nusually\ncalled \"conservation of probability\" or \"unitarity\" and is represented mathematically by the general relation\nP\nP\n\u03b2 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192\u03bd\u0304\u03b2 = 1. Hence, this argument actually proves that the probability to detect a charged lepton does not\noscillates in space-time!\n\n6\n\n\f6.2 Is the Standard Phase Wrong by a Factor of 2? No!\nIt as been claimed that the standard phase of neutrino oscillations in Eq. (2.7),\n\u03a6kj = \u2212\n\n\u2206m2kj L\n,\n2E\n\n(6.1)\n\nis wrong by a factor of two [66] or there is an ambiguity by a factor of two in the oscillation phase [67, 68, 69, 70]. A\nsimilar discrepancy by a factor of two in the phase of K 0 \u2212 K\u0304 0 oscillations has been claimed in Refs. [62, 71, 72]\nand an ambiguity by a factor of two has been claimed in Ref. [73]. These claims, which have been refuted in\nRefs. [29, 31, 34, 64, 74, 75, 76, 77], stem from the following fallacious reasoning.\nDifferent massive neutrinos propagate with different velocities\nvk =\n\npk\n,\nEk\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere Ek and pk are, respectively, the energy and momentum of the neutrino with mass mk , related by the\nrelativistic dispersion relation (5.3). According to the fallacious reasoning, the phases of the different massive\nneutrinos wave functions after a propagation distance L should take into account the different times of propagation\nof different massive neutrinos:\n\u03a6\u0303k = pk L \u2212 Ek tk .\n(6.3)\nThe propagation times are given by\ntk =\n\nEk\nL\n=\nL,\nvk\npk\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhich lead, in the relativistic approximation, to the phase difference\n\u2206\u03a6\u0303kj \u2261 \u03a6\u0303k \u2212 \u03a6\u0303j = \u2212\n\n\u2206m2kj L\n.\nE\n\n(6.5)\n\nThis phase difference is twice of the standard one in Eq. (6.1).\nLet us notice that in Eq. (6.3) we have considered the possibility of different energies and momenta for different\nmassive neutrino wave functions, as we have done in the covariant derivation of the neutrino oscillation probability\nin Section 5. The authors of Refs. [67, 70, 73] claimed that a correct way to obtain the standard oscillation phase\nis to assume the same energy for the different massive neutrino wave functions. Apart from the fact that this is an\nunphysical assumption [29, 30, 33, 33], it is not true that the disagreement of a factor of two disappears assuming\nthe same energy for the different massive neutrino wave functions, as clearly shown by the above derivation of\nEq. (6.5), in which the energies of the different massive neutrino wave functions could have been taken to be equal\n[31, 78]. Indeed, even if the different massive neutrino wave functions have the same energy, the time contribution\n\u2212Etk + Etj to the phase difference \u2206\u03a6\u0303kj does not disappear if tk 6= tj . This contribution has been missed in\nRefs. [67, 70, 73].\nThe mistake in the fallacious reasoning described above is due to a wrong use of the group velocity (6.2) in the\nphase (6.3), which cannot depend on the group velocity. The group velocity (6.2) is the velocity of the factor\nwhich modulates the amplitude of the wave packet of the corresponding massive neutrino. In neutrino oscillation\nexperiments the envelopes of the wave packets of the different massive neutrinos propagate with the corresponding\ngroup velocity and take different times to cover the distance between the source and the detector. However, these\ndifferent propagation times have no effect on the phases of the wave functions of the different massive neutrinos,\nwhose interference generates the oscillations. Since the interference is a local effect, it must be calculated at the\nsame time, as well as in the same point, for all the massive neutrino contributions [29, 31, 34, 64, 74, 75, 76, 77], as\nwe have done in Section 5. Since only the amplitude of the wave function of each massive neutrino is determined\nby the wave packet envelope, the only possible effect of the different arrival times of the envelopes of the wave\npackets of different massive neutrinos is a reduction of the overlap of the different wave packets, leading to a\ndecoherence effect [11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31, 32, 33, 36, 43]. For more details, see Ref. [31].\n\n6.3 Are Flavor Neutrinos Described by Fock States? No!\nIt must be noted that the flavor state (2.2) is not a quantum of the flavor field \u03bd\u03b1 [15]. Indeed, one can easily check\nthat the flavor state (2.2) is not annihilated by the flavor field \u03bd\u03b1 if the neutrino masses are taken into account. It\nis, however, possible to construct a Fock space for the quantized flavor fields [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]. Then,\n7\n\n\fit is natural to ask if the flavor Fock states describe real neutrinos, produced and detected in charged-current weak\ninteraction processes. Let us notice that, since the flavor Fock states are different from the standard flavor states\n(2.2) and the \"exact\" flavor states (3.11) that we have derived in the framework of Quantum Field Theory, if the\nanswer to the question under discussion were positive, the theory of neutrino oscillations would have to be revised,\nas claimed in Refs. [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]. However, the answer is negative, as explained in Ref. [86], to\nwhich we direct the interested reader for the detailed proof. Here we mention only that the unphysical character\nof the flavor Fock states can be proved by reductio ad absurdum: the description of neutrinos created or detected\nin charged-current weak interaction processes through the flavor Fock states leads to unphysical results. Let us\nemphasize that this fact precludes the description of neutrinos in oscillation experiments through the flavor Fock\nstates, because these neutrinos must be produced and detected in weak interaction processes. Hence, the flavor\nFock states are ingenious mathematical constructs without relevance for the description of real neutrinos.\n\n7 Conclusions\nWe have shown that the standard flavor states (2.2) used in the derivation of neutrino oscillations can be derived in\nthe framework of Quantum Field Theory in the realistic case of ultrarelativistic neutrinos (Section 3). In Section 4\nwe have shown that the \"exact\" flavor states (3.11) are appropriate for the description of neutrinos produced or\ndetected in charged-current weak-interaction processes, taking into account the neutrino masses. In Section 5 we\nhave presented a covariant derivation of the probability of neutrino oscillations which is consistent with the fact that\nflavor is Lorentz-invariant. Finally, in Section 6 we have discussed the negative answers to three questions which\nare often asked. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that the standard expression (2.7) for the probability of\nneutrino oscillations in vacuum has been proved to be correct in the framework of Quantum Field Theory and all\ncontrary claims stem from some misunderstanding.\n\nReferences\n[1] B.
