We show that the ground state\nenergy of such system, as a functional of the ionic configurations,\nhas local minima in correspondence of configurations described by\nsmooth p\u03c0F periodic functions, if the interaction is repulsive and large\nenough and pF is the Fermi momentum of the electrons. This means\nphysically that a d = 1 metal develop a periodic distortion of its\nreticular structure (Peierls instability). The minima are found solving\nthe Eulero-Lagrange equations of the energy by a contraction method.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nMain results\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1955 Peierls [P] suggested that in a one dimensional metal it would be\nenergetically favorable to develop a periodic distortion of the linear lattice\nwith period p\u03c0F where pF is the Fermi momentum of the conduction electrons; indeed periodic lattice distortions with period p\u03c0F have been observed\nexperimentally in many anisotropic compounds [F]. Theoretical attempts to\nunderstand Peierls instability are based on a variational approach; a functional of the ion configurations describing the total energy of the metal is\nintroduced, and if such functional has a minimum in correspondence of p\u03c0F periodic configuration, one says that there is Peierls instability. In [KL] the\n1\n\n\fcase pF = \u03c02 was considered and it was indeed shown that in the Holstein\nmodel, describing fermions interacting with the ions of the lattice without\nelectron-electron interaction, the energy has a global minimum in correspondence of a configuration of period p\u03c0F = 2. The case pF = \u03c02 is rather special\nas the hamiltonian enjoys many special symmetries. In [BGM] it was treated\nthe Holstein model with pF = \u03c0 PQ , with P, Q relative prime integers, and\nit was shown that the Holstein model energy has local minima which correspond to p\u03c0F periodic function, if the interaction is \u2264 e| log Q|\u22121 for some\nsmall \u03b5. The Holstein model with large interaction was treated in [AAR],\nwhere Peierls instability was proved (in such regime however the minimizing periodic function has infinite many discontinuities, contrary to the small\ninteraction case in which it is a smooth function).\nThere are two main open problems; the first is what happens considering\npF\nas an irrational number (the incommensurate case), and the second is\n\u03c0\nwhat is the effect of an interaction among electrons on Peierls instability.\nIn this paper we consider the second problem; its relevance is quite clear as\nany realistic model must include some interaction between electrons. The\nonly paper considering Peierls instability in presence of an electron-electron\ninteraction is [LN], which is limited to the case pF = \u03c02 so that one can\nuse symmetries which are absent in the general case. We will consider the\ngeneral (spinless) commensurate case pF = \u03c0 PQ with weak electron-ion and\nelectron-electron interaction. No assumptions is done on the relative size\nas both the cases are interesting. There are physical situations in which\nthe electron-ion interaction dominates over the electron-electron interaction\n(like in conventional low temperature superconductors) but other in which\nthe opposite situation is found (like in high-temperature superconducting\ncuprates, see [FJ]).\n\n1.2\n\nPeierls instability\n\nWe can assume than that the units of the crystal form a liner chains with\nspacing a = 1 and the fermions, in the tight binding approximation, are\nhopping from one site to another. If \u039b = 1, 2, ...., L and \u03c8x\u00b1 are creation or\nannihilation spinless fermionic operators with periodic boundary conditions\n\n2\n\n\fverifying canonical anticommutation relations the hamiltonian is,\nHF =\n\nX\n\nx\u2208\u039b\n\n+U\n\n\u2212\n+\n[tx \u03c8x+ \u03c8x+1\n+ tx \u03c8x+1\n\u03c8x\u2212 \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03bd)\u03c8x+ \u03c8x\u2212 ] +\n\n1\n1 + \u2212\n\u03c8x+1 \u2212 ]\n[\u03c8x+ \u03c8x\u2212 \u2212 ][\u03c8x+1\n2\n2\nx\u2208\u039b\nX\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential and \u03bc = 1 \u2212 cos pF . We assume moreover\nthat L = iQ for i > 0 integer (this is for preserving periodic boundary\nconditions, see below). The hopping matrix element tx is a resonance integral\nbetween orbitals at site x and x + 1 and therefore it depends on the distance\n\u03c6x between these sites; we can choose\ntx = \u22121 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c6x\n\n(2)\n\nAlthough in more refined models the lattice distortion should be treated\nquantum-mechanically a more common choice, which we will follow here,\nis to treat them in the Born-Oppenhmeier approximation by adding to the\nP 2\nfermionic hamiltonian a term of the form x \u03c62x . The total energy of the\nsystem is then\n1X 2\n\u03c6 + E0 (\u03c6)\n(3)\nF (\u03c6) =\n2 x\u2208\u039b x\nwhere E0 (\u03c6) is the ground state energy of the fermionic hamiltonian HF i.e.\nT rHF e\u2212\u03b2HF\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e T re\u2212\u03b2HF\n\nE0 (\u03c6) = lim\n\n(4)\n\nWe fix units so that (assuming pF 6= 0, \u03c0) sin pF = 1. The last term in\nthe hamiltonian takes into account the interaction between fermions with\ncoupling U; one site interaction is forbidden by Pauli principle (the fermions\nare spinless) so a nearest neighbor interaction is considered. Of course U > 0\nin order to describe Coulomb interaction, but also U < 0 is conceivable as a\nconsequence of the interaction with phonons. Finally \u03bd is a counterterm to\nbe fixed to a suitable way as a function of U (see below).\nWe will consider F (\u03c6) as a functional F : \u03a9 \u2192 R where \u03a9 is the class of\nfunctions defined below.\n\n3\n\n\f\u03c0\npF\n\nDefinition 1. \u03a9 is the class of functions \u03c6x : \u039b \u2192 R periodic with period\n, even and such that\n[(Q\u22121)/2]\n\n\u03c6x =\n\n\u03c6\u0302n ei2pF nx\n\nX\n\n(5)\n\nn=\u2212[Q/2]\nn6=0\n\nwith \u03bb\u03c6\u03021 = \u03c3, \u03c6\u0302n = \u03c6\u0302\u2212n and\n|\u03bb\u03c6\u0302n | \u2264\n\nC|\u03c3|\n1 + |n|2\n\n(6)\n\nwith |\u03c3| < 1. We define a norm in \u03a9 as ||\u03c6|| = x\u2208\u039b |\u03c6x |\nThe functional F (\u03c6) is defined over the p\u03c0F -periodic functions. As x \u2208 \u039b\nthen the Fourier coefficients of \u03c6x are O(Q); if pF = \u03c02 there is only one\ncoefficient \u03c6x = \u03c6\u03021 (\u22121)x . By (6) we are requiring that \u03c6x has the 2pF harmonic non vanishing (by such a condition if \u03c6\u03021 = 0 then \u03c6x is a constant).\nMoreover if \u03c6 is an extremal point of F (\u03c6), it must satisfy the condition\n\u03c6\u03020 = \u03bb\u03c1 where \u03c1 is the fermionic density. On the other hand, we can always\ninclude \u03c6\u03020 in the chemical potential \u03bc and then we can restrict our search of\nlocal minima of F (\u03c6) to fields \u03c6 with zero mean. The infinite length limit\nis performed along a sequence of L so that periodic boundary conditions on\n\u03c6x are preserved. In the following the N depending constants (not dependent of \u03bb, U, Q) are generically denoted by C; all the other constants are N\nindependent. With the above notation we will prove the following theorem.\nP\n\nP\nTheorem 1Given the Hamiltonian (1) with pF = \u03c0 Q\nand P, Q positive\nprime, it is possible to find an \u03b5 and a function \u03bd = \u03bd(U) = O(U) such that:\na)If U \u2265 0 (repulsive interaction) and |\u03bb|, |U| \u2264 | log\u03b5Q|C then F : \u03a9 \u2192 R\nhas a local minimum \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9 given by (5) with\n\n|\u03bb\u03c6\u03021 | = A(1 + g2 )(1 +\n|\u03bb\u03c6\u0302n | \u2264\n\nC\u03bb2N\n|n|N\n\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b71\n)\n\u03bb2 g 1\n\nn 6= 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b7(U) = \u03b21 U + O(U 2 ), g2 = O(\u03bb, U) and g1 (U) = a1 + O(\u03bb, U) are continuous functions, N is a positive integer and a, \u03b21 , C are positive constants.\n4\n\n\f|\n1\nb)If U < 0 (attractive interaction) but \u03bb|U\n2 a \u2264 2 then, if |\u03bb|, |U| \u2264\n1\nF : \u03a9 \u2192 R has a local minimum \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9 given by (5) (7).\n|\nc)If U < 0 (attractive interaction) but \u03bb|U\n2 a \u2265 3 then, if |\u03bb|, |U| \u2264\n1\nthere is no local minima \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9 for F : \u03a9 \u2192 R\n\n\u03b5\n,\n| log Q|C\n\u03b5\n,\n| log Q|C\n\nIn the U = 0 case Peierls instability is found [BGM] with \u03bd = 0, |\u03bb| \u2264\na+O(\u03bb)\n\nand |\u03bb\u03c6\u03021 | = Ae\u2212 \u03bb2 . The fact that \u03bd = 0 means that there is\na simple relation between the chemical potential \u03bc and the period of the\nminimizing \u03c6x , i.e.\u03bc = 1 \u2212 cos pF . If U 6= 0 things are different. To find a\nminimizing \u03c6x with period p\u03c0F one fixes the chemical potential to the value\n1 \u2212 cos pF + \u03bd, where \u03bd is a suitable counterterm. In some special case \u03bd = 0\n(for instance when pF = \u03c02 ) but in general \u03bd is a non vanishing function.\nThe above theorem says that, when U is smaller than \u03bb the electron-electron\ninteraction does not modify essentially the Peierls instability, as we find that\nthe dependence of \u03c3 from \u03bb is essentially the same as in the U = 0 case, as\n\u03b5\n| log Q|CN\n\n|\u03c3| = A[(1 + g2 )(1 +\n\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b71\n\u2212 a2 [1+O( U2 )]\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n=\nAe\n)]\n\u03bb2 g 1\n\nOn the other hand if U is larger than \u03bb the electron-electron interaction has\na quite dramatic effect. For attractive interaction U < 0 there is no Peierls\ninstability (i.e.the electron-electron interaction destroys Peierls instability)\nwhile for repulsive interaction U > 0 there Peierls instability but the dependence of \u03c6x from \u03bb, U is completely different with respect to the U = 0 case.\nNote also that there is a weak dependence of \u03bb, U on Q i.e.\u03bb, U \u2264 O(log Q\u22121 );\nthis means that our result can be applied to \"almost incommensurate\" \u03c6x ,\ni.e.such that Q is quite large (but log Q is reasonably small). The expansion\nfor the Ground state energy is similar to the one discussed in literature in\nmany papers (see for istance [BM]) expect that 1)one has to understand the\ndependence on Q of the constants, and it is crucial to have careful bounds\nin order to have results valid for \u03bb, U \u2264 O(log Q\u22121 ); b)one has to prove that\n\u03bd is \u03bb-independent. Finally note that the presence of the spin should not\nchange the result when pF 6= \u03c02 and U > 0.\n\n5\n\n\f1.3\n\nThe contraction method\n\nIt is well known (see [BM]) that E0 (\u03c6) can be written as a Grassman integral\n1\n\n1\nlog\nE0 (\u03c6) = \u2212 lim\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e L\u03b2\n\nZ\n\nP (d\u03c8)e\u2212U V \u2212\u03bbP \u2212\u03bdN ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nV =\n\n\u03b2\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2212 \u03b22\n\nP =\u2212\n\nZ\n\ndx0\n\u03b2\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b22\n\n1\n1\n[\u03c8~x+ \u03c8~x\u2212 \u2212 ][\u03c8~x++1 \u03c8~x\u2212+1 \u2212 ],\n2\n2\nx\u2208\u039b\nX\n\ndx0\n\nX\n\n\u03c6(x)\u03c8~x+ \u03c8~x\u2212 ,\n\nN=\n\nx\u2208\u039b\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b22\n\ndx0\n\n(9)\nX\n\n\u03c8~x+ \u03c8~x\u2212 ,\n\nx\u2208\u039b\n\nand ~x = (x0 , x) and ~x + 1 = (x0 , x + 1).

However we will show\nin that it is possible to choose \u03bd as independent from \u03bb and so on \u03c6\u0302x . This\nis due to the fact that the chemical potential can be moved inside the gap\nopened by \u03c6x without affecting any physical property, and we can use this\nfreedom to fix \u03bd as independent of \u03c6\u0302x . It follows that a necessary condition\nfor \u03c6x \u2208 \u03a9 to be a local minimum for F (\u03c6) is that it verifies \u03c6x = \u03bb\u03c1x where\n\u03c1x = lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e,\u03c4 \u21920 L1 S L,\u03b2 (x, \u03c4 ; x, 0) and S L,\u03b2 (x, \u03c4 ; x, 0) is the Schwinger function defined by, if \u03c6~\u00b1\nx are Grassman variables and writing\nS\n\nL,\u03b2\n\nR\n\nd~x =\n\nR\n\n\u03b2\n2\n\u2212\u03b2\n2\n\nZ\nR\n\u2212 +\n\u22022\n\u2212V(\u03c8)\u2212 d~\nx[\u03c6~+\n\u03c8x\u2212 +\u03c6~x\n\u03c8~x ]\nx ~\n|\u03c6=0 ,\n(~x; ~y ) = + \u2212 log P (d\u03c8)e\n\u03c6~x \u2202\u03c6~y\n\nx\u2208\u039b ,\n\nP\n\n(11)\n\n1\nWe use the same symbol \u03c8 for field and Grassman variables with a traditional abuse\nof notation.\n\n6\n\n\fand V = UV +\u03bbP +\u03bdN.

The above procedure is iterated untill a scale h\u2217 defined as the minimum\n\u2217\nh such that \u03b3 h > |\u03c3h |. Then we will integrate directly the field \u03c8 (<h ) =\nPh\u2217\n(k)\nwithout splitting the corresponding integration in scales (as was\nk=\u2212\u221e \u03c8\n\u2217\ndone for h > h\u2217 ). This can be done as g \u2264h (~x \u2212 ~y ) verifies the bound eq(33)\nwith h\u2217 replacing h i.e.it verifies the bound valid for a single scale; the reason\n\u2217\nis that for momenta larger than O(\u03b3 h ) the theory is essentially a massless\n\u2217\ntheory and for momenta smaller is a massive theory with mass O(\u03b3 h ). We\nwill call running coupling constants ~vh = (Uh , \u03b4h , \u03bdh ) and renormalization\nconstants Zh , \u03c3h ; their behaviour as a function of h can be found by an\niterative equation called beta function (see below).\n\n2.2\n\nBounds for the effective potential\n\nAs explained, for example, in [BM], one can write the effective potential on\nscale j, if h \u2264 j < 0, as a sum of terms, which is indeed a finite sum for\nfinite values of N, L, \u03b2. Each term of this expansion is associated with a tree\nin the following way.\n\n16\n\n\f1) Let us consider the family of all trees which can be constructed by\njoining a point r, the root, with an ordered set of b \u2265 1 points, the endpoints\nof the unlabeled tree, so that r is not a branching point. n will be called the\norder of the unlabeled tree and the branching points will be called the non\ntrivial vertices. The unlabeled trees are partially ordered from the root to\nthe endpoints in the natural way; we shall use the symbol < to denote the\npartial order.\nTwo unlabeled trees are identified if they can be superposed by a suitable\ncontinuous deformation, so that the endpoints with the same index coincide.\nIt is then easy to see that the number of unlabeled trees with b end-points is\nbounded by 4b .\nWe shall consider also the labeled trees (to be called simply trees in the\nfollowing); they are defined by associating some labels with the unlabeled\ntrees, as explained in the following items.\n2) We associate a label j \u2264 0 with the root and we denote Tj,b the\ncorresponding set of labeled trees with n endpoints. Moreover, we introduce\na family of vertical lines, labeled by an an integer taking values in [j, 2], and\nwe represent any tree \u03c4 \u2208 Tj,n so that, if v is an endpoint or a non trivial\nvertex, it is contained in a vertical line with index hv > h, to be called the\nscale of v, while the root is on the line with index j. There is the constraint\nthat, if v is an endpoint, hv > j + 1.\nThe tree will intersect in general the vertical lines in set of points different\nfrom the root, the endpoints and the non trivial vertices; these points will\nbe called trivial vertices. The set of the vertices of \u03c4 will be the union of the\nendpoints, the trivial vertices and the non trivial vertices. Note that, if v1\nand v2 are two vertices and v1 < v2 , then hv1 < hv2 .\nMoreover, there is only one vertex immediately following the root, which\nwill be denoted v0 and can not be an endpoint; its scale is j + 1.\n3) With each endpoint v of scale hv 6= 2 we associate one of the two local\nterms contributing to LV\u0302 (hv \u22121) in the r.h.s. of (36) and one space-time point\n~xv . If hv = 2 we associate one of the addend of V (9). We denote by Va the\nset of end-points v with hv = 2 to which is associated e2inv pF x \u03c6\u0302nv i.e.one of\nthe addenda of P in (9); moreover q = |Va |.\nMoreover, we impose the constraint that, if v is an endpoint, hv = hv\u2032 + 1,\n\u2032\nif v is the non trivial vertex immediately preceding v and hv 6= 1. Given a\nvertex v, ~xv denotes the family of all space-time points associated with one\nend-points following v.\n17\n\n\f4) If v is not an endpoint, the cluster Lv with frequency hv is the set\nof endpoints following the vertex v; if v is an endpoint, it is itself a (trivial)\ncluster. The tree provides an organization of endpoints into a hierarchy of\nclusters.\n5) We introduce a field label f to distinguish the field variables appearing\nin the terms associated with the endpoints as in item 3); the set of field labels\nassociated with the endpoint v will be called Iv . Analogously, if v is not an\nendpoint, we shall call Iv the set of field labels associated with the endpoints\nfollowing the vertex v; ~x(f ), \u03c3(f ) and \u03c9(f ) will denote the space-time point,\nthe \u03c3 index and the \u03c9 index, respectively, of the field variable with label f .\n6) We associate with any vertex v a set Pv with the labels associated with\nthe external fields of v. These sets must satisfy various constraints. First of\nall, if v is not an endpoint and v1 , . . . , vsv are the sv vertices immediately\nfollowing it, then Pv \u2282 \u222ai Pvi . We shall denote Qvi the intersection of Pv\nand Pvi ; this definition implies that Pv = \u222ai Qvi . The subsets Pvi /Qvi , whose\nunion will be made, by definition, of the internal fields of v, have to be non\nempty, if sv > 1, that is if v is a non trivial vertex. To each v is associated\nan integer Nv such that\nX\n\n\u03b5(f )~k(f ) = 2Nv pF\n\nf \u2208Pv\n\nGiven \u03c4 \u2208 Tj,n , there are many possible choices of the subsets Pv , v \u2208 \u03c4 ,\ncompatible with the previous constraints; let us call P one of this choices.\nGiven P, we consider the family GP of all connected Feynman graphs, such\nthat, for any v \u2208 \u03c4 , the internal fields of v are paired by propagators of scale\nhv , so that the following condition is satisfied: for any v \u2208 \u03c4 , the subgraph\nbuilt by the propagators associated with all vertices v \u2032 \u2265 v is connected.\nThe sets Pv have, in this picture, the role of the external legs of the subgraph\nassociated with v. The graphs belonging to GP will be called compatible with\nP and we shall denote P\u03c4 the family of all choices of P such that GP is not\nempty.\nAs explained in detail in [BM], we can write, if h \u2264 j \u2264 \u22121,\nq\n\nV (j) ( Zj \u03c8 [h,j]) + L\u03b2 \u1ebcj+1 =\n=\n\n\u221e X\nX\n\nX q\n\nb=1 \u03c4 \u2208Tj,b P\u2208P\u03c4\n\nZj\n\n|Pv0 |\n\nZ\n\n18\n\n(j+1)\n\nd~xv0 \u03c8\u0303 [h,j](Pv0 )K\u03c4,P (~xv0 )\n\n(39)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03c8\u0303 [h,j](Pv ) =\n\nY\n\n[h,j]\u03c3(f )\n\n\u03c8~x(f ),\u03c9(f )\n\nf \u2208Pv\n(j+1)\n\nand K\u03c4,P (~xv0 ) is a suitable function, which is obtained by summing the\nvalues of all the Feynman graphs compatible with P, see item 6) above, and\napplying iteratively in the vertices of the tree, different from the endpoints\nand v0 , the R-operation, starting from the vertices with higher scale; see\nagain [BM] for a more precise definition.\nIn order to control, uniformly in L and \u03b2, the various sums in (39), one\nhas to exploit in a careful way the R operation acting on the vertices of the\ntree, as explained in full detail in [BM]. The result of this analysis, which\ncan be applied without any problem to the model studied in this paper, is\na general bound which has a simple dimensional interpretation and can be\neasily generalized to bound the density Fourier transforms, as we shall prove\nin the following sections.\nBefore giving a brief description of this representation, let us see what\nhappens if we erase the R operation in all the vertices of the tree. In this\ncase one gets the bound\nZ\n\n(j+1)\n\nd~xv0 |K\u03c4,P (~xv0 )| \u2264\n\nL\u03b2 (C \u03b5\u0304)b\u2212q |\u03c3|q \u03b3 \u2212j(\u22122+|Pv0 |/2)\n\n(40)\nY\n\n(\n\nv not e.p\n\nZhv |Pv | \u2212(\u22122+ |Pv | + z\u0303(Pv ) ) Y |\u03c6\u0302nv |\n2\n2\n) 2 \u03b3\nZhv \u22121\nv\u2208Va |\u03c3|\n\nwhere C is a suitable constant and \u03b5\u0304 = maxj+1\u2264j \u2032 \u22640 |~vj \u2032 |; moreover z\u0303(Pv ) = 1\nP\nif |Pv | = 2, \u03c9(f1 ) = \u2212\u03c9(f2 ) and f \u2208Pv \u03b5(f )\u03c9(f ) + 2Nv pF = 0. The factor\n\u03b3 z\u0303(Pv ) derives from the following inequality (see 3.106 of [BM]) if k > h\n1\n|\u03c3h | 1\n|\u03c3k |\n\u2264 h \u03b3 2 (h\u2212k) \u2264 \u03b3 2 (h\u2212k) .\nk\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n(41)\n\nThe good dependence on the number of end-points b derives from the\nuse of the Gram-Hadamard inequality for the determinants appearing in\nz\u0303(Pv )\n(j+1)\nK\u03c4,P (~xv0 ), see [BM] . The bound (41) allows to associate a factor \u03b3 2\u2212|Pv |/2+ 2\nwith any trivial or non trivial vertex of the tree. This would allow to control\nthe sums over the scale labels and P\u03c4 , if |Pv | were larger than 4 in all vertices,\nwhich is not true. The effect of the R operation is to improve the bound,\nso that there is a factor less than 1 associate even with the vertices where\n19\n\n\f|Pv | is equal to 2 or 4 and eq(23) holds. In order to explain how this works,\nwe need a more detailed discussion of the R operation. We can consider for\nistance the case of |Pv | = 4; then\nL\n\nZ\n\nd~xW (~x)\n\n4\nY\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n\u03c8~xi ,\u03c9i i =\n\ni=1\n\nZ\n\n4\nY\n\nd~xW (~x)\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n\u03c8~x4 ,\u03c9i i ] ,\n\n(42)\n\ni=1\n\n(j)\nwhere ~x = (~x1 , . . . , ~x4 ) and W (~x) is the Fourier transform of \u01744,~\u03c9 (~k1 , ~k2 , ~k3 ).\nNote that W (~x) is translation invariant (despite the theory is not transla[h,j]\u03c3\ntionally invariant); hence \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c9i i in the r.h.s. of (42) can be substituted\n[h,j]\u03c3\nwith \u03c8~xk ,\u03c9i i , k = 1, 2, 3 and we have four equivalent representations of the\nlocalization operation, which differ by the choice of the localization point.\nWe have\n4\nY\n\n4\nY\n\n4\nY\n\n#\n\nR\n\nd~xW (~x)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd~xW (~x) \u03c8~x1 ,\u03c91 1 \u03c8~x2 ,\u03c92 2 D~x3 ,~x4,\u03c933 \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c94 4 + \u03c8~x1 ,\u03c91 1 D~x2 ,~x4 ,\u03c922 \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c93 3 \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c94 4 +\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\u03c8~xi ,\u03c9i i\n\n=\n\ni=1\n\n1[h,j]\u03c3\n\nh\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\nZ\n\nd~xW (~x)\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n1[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n+D~x1 ,~x4 ,\u03c911 \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c92 2 \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c93 3 \u03c8~x4 ,\u03c94 4\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\u03c8~xi ,\u03c9i i\n\ni=1\n\n\u2212\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\ni\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\u03c8~x4 ,\u03c9i i\n\ni=1\n1[h,j]\u03c3\n\n=\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n(43)\n\nwhere (again if L = \u03b2 = \u221e)\n1[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\nD~y,~x,\u03c9 = \u03c8~y,\u03c9\n1[h,j]\u03c3\n\n[h,j]\u03c3\n\n\u2212 \u03c8~x,\u03c9\n\nThe field D~y,~x,\u03c9 is dimensionally equivalent to the product of |~y \u2212 ~x|\nand the derivative of the field, so that the bound of its contraction with\n\u2032\nanother field variable on a scale j \u2032 < j will produce a \"gain\" \u03b3 \u2212(j\u2212j ) with\n[h,j]\u03c3\nrespect to the contraction of \u03c8~y,\u03c9 . On the other hand, each term in the\nr.h.s. of (43) differs from the term which R acts on mainly because one \u03c8 [h,j]\nfield is substituted with a D 1[h,j] field and some of the other \u03c8 [h,j] fields are\n\"translated\" in the localization point. All three terms share the property\nthat the field whose ~x coordinate is equal to the localization point is not\naffected by the action of R. Analogous consideration can be done for the\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncase 2n = 2; note that one gets the factor \u03b3 2(j\u2212j ) if \u03c91 = \u03c92 and \u03b3 (j\u2212j ) if\n\u03c91 = \u03c92 .

There is a constant \u03b50 , such that, if |\u03bb| \u2264 \u03b50 , then, uniformly\nin the infrared cutoff,\n\u03bbj = \u03bb + O(\u03bb2 ) ,\n\n\u03b4j = O(\u03bb2 ) ,\n\nh \u2264 j \u2264 \u22121\n\n(46)\n\nby which we obtain that \u03b5\u0304 \u2264 C \u2032 |U|.

We\nconsider then a maximal v \u2208 Vb , i.e.v such that there is no v\u0304 \u2208 Va in Lv ;\nthere is a path C \u2208 \u03c4 (called maximal path) connecting v with an end point\nv\u0304 \u2208 Va ; then by (48)\n1 = Q2 Q\u22122 \u2264 Q2\n\nY\n\n\u03b3 \u2212\u1e91(Pv )\n\n(49)\n\nv\u2208C\n\nwhere \u1e91(Pv ) = 2 if v \u2208 C and zero otherwise.

Hence,\nit is very easy to see that (52) is satisfied for j = \u22121. The\nq fact that it is valid\n(j)\nfor any j follows from our choice to regularize B\u03c6 ( Zj \u03c8) by regularizing\nthe effective potential in the r.h.s. of (52), that is by decomposing V (j) as\nLV (j) + RV (j) . This implies, in particular, that we have to extract from the\neffectiveqpotential the term proportional to zj ; the corresponding contribution\n(j)\nto B\u03c6 ( Zj \u03c8) is then absorbed in the term in the third line of (52), before\nrescaling the field \u03c8 and performing the integration of the scale j field. It\nis then easy to check that (52) is satisfied for j = j\u0304 + 1, if it is satisfied for\nj = j\u0304 (for more details, see [BM]).\nNote that, if \u011d\u03c9(j) (~k) 6= 0\nP\n\n\u03b5\n~\n~ Zj\nQ\u0302(j)\n\u03c9 (k) = 1 \u2212 zj fj+1 (k)\nZ\u0303j (~k)\n\nHence, the propagator \u011d\u03c9Q,(i)(~k) is equivalent to \u011d\u03c9(i) (~k), as concerns the dimensional bounds.\nWe can expand the functional in terms of trees, as we did for the effective\npotential, by suitably modifying the definitions adding a new type of endpoints, to be called of type \u03c6 and to which associated the terms in the last\nline of (52). Moreover we change the definition of the sets Pv so that the set\nPv includes both the field variables of type \u03c8 which are not yet contracted in\nthe vertex v, to be called normal external fields, and those which belong to\na normal endpoint and are contracted with a field variable belonging to an\nendpoint of type \u03c6 through a propagator g Q,(hv ) , to be called special external\nfields of v.\nFrom the expansion of the two point Schwinger function we obtain an\nexpansion for the density. We call h1 and h2 , with h1 \u2264 h2 (say) the scales\nof the external propagators g Q,(hv ) ; we call moreover v\u0304 the first vertex such\nthat both the two end-points of type \u03c6 are connected; of course \u03b3 hv\u0304 \u2264 \u03b3 h1 .\nWith respect to the expansion for the effective potential, R = 1 for v \u2264 v\u0304\nwith |Pv | = 4. We write\n\u03c1n =\n\nZ\n\nd~k\u03c1n (~k) =\n\nX Z\n\nd~kfh1 (~k)fh2 (~k + 2npF )\u03c1n (~k)\n\n(53)\n\nh1 ,h2\n\n\u03c1n is given by a sum over trees; in order to sum over the scales of the vertices\nof the tree we sum over the difference hv \u2212 hv\u2032 between consecutive vertices\n24\n\n\fand over the scale of a vertex; instead of choosing v0 like in the preceding\nsection we fix v\u0304. Dimensionally the bound for (53) is very similar to the\nbound for the effective potential with two external line; the \u03c6 end-points in\n(53) are like two \u03bd-vertices, and the integration over ~k allows to associate to\nthe \u03c6 end points the dimensional factor \u03b3 h1 \u03b3 h2 .
