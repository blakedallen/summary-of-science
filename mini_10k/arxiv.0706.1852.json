The fundamental\nassumption is that gene transcription, the copying of a\nstretch of DNA into mRNA, is either \"on\" or \"off\". This\nstate of transcription depend on whether certain gene\nspecific DNA binding proteins, transcription factors, are\nbound, or not, to the promoter region of the gene. A gene\nmay be controlled by one or more transcription factors,\neach having a varying number of binding sites in the promoter region. The action of the transcription factor may\nin turn be either inhibitory or excitatory. Inhibition can\narise from blocking access of the RNA-Polymerase to the\ntranscription start site, while a stimulating effect is obtained if the bound factor stabilizes the Polymerase-DNA\ncomplex. A paradigmatic example where both effects are\npresent is lysogeny maintenance in phage \u03bb[3, 4]. DNA\nlooping, where distantly bound transcription factors interact and affect transcription, is also possible.\nAt a given transcription factor concentration, each possible state of promoter bound factors occurs with a probability given by a grand canonical ensemble formula. The\npromoter region with the binding sites (with or without\ntranscription factors) corresponds to the small system,\nand the cytoplasm, with a large number of transcription\nfactors moving around, serves as the reservoir. Quite\noften transcription factors bind in dimer (or multimer)\nform, in which case the relevant concentration is determined by balance from the total concentration. In summary, the rate of transcription is a non-linear, sometimes\nquite complicated, function of the concentrations of the\ntranscription factors regulating the gene.\nOne important property in gene regulation is coopera-\n\ntivity. If a single copy of a protein molecule in monomer\nform were to (positively) regulate a certain gene, the activity of that gene would follow the well-known MichaelisMenten curve. The transcription rate would then be proportional to the concentration of the regulating molecule,\nup to a threshold above which it would level off. In\nother words, there would be appreciably high transcription even at very low concentrations of the regulating\nprotein. The rationale for transcription factor often binding in multimer form, and of multiple DNA binding sites\nenabling cooperative interactions, is therefore assumed\nto be that it results in a sharper, more \"all-or-nothing\"\nswitch.\nMultiple binding sites for one and the same transcription factor are common in eukaryotic promoters. The\nobject of this paper is one particular viral example of no\nless than 20 binding sites for a viral factor, where transcriptional activity has been observed to require 8 bound\nmolecules [5, 6], see section II below. In addition, these\nsites are interleaved with an equal number of binding sites\nof a host transcription factor, presumably imposing the\nopposite effect. In a previous contribution, [7], we introduced, for reasons of computational simplicity, a thermodynamic model of this promoter switch ignoring eventual\ncooperative bindings and allowing some steric hindrance.\nAlthough direct experimental evidence is lacking, cooperative bindings of the viral transcription factor at this\npromoter is likely to be present, as well as more extensive blocking scenarios due the closely spaced sites. Both\nthese mechanisms are likely to affect the sharpness of the\nswitch.\nWe show in this paper that while cooperative protein\ninteractions is one way to achieve effective cooperativity\nof the switch, accounting for full steric hindrance (blocking) of one species of molecules on the other is a more\n\n\f2\neffective one. Therefore, a possible functional role of the\nalternating pattern of binding sites could be increasing\neffective cooperativity when the promoter architecture do\nnot allow for cooperative molecular interactions.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section II we\ndescribe our example, and in section III we describe our\nmodel of cooperativity and competition in this example.\nIn section IV we summarize and discuss our results.\n\nII.\n\nTHE EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, THE EBNA-1\nPROTEIN, AND THE C PROMOTER\n\nThe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) belongs to the gammaherpes virus family, with relatives among other primate\nlymphocryptoviruses, and has likely co-evolved with man\nfor a very long time [8]. Although not discovered until\nthe 1960ies, it is now known to infect more than 90 % of\nthe human population. The infection is asymptomatic if\nit occurs early in life, while later infection may result in\ninfectious mononucleosis, more commonly known as \"the\nkissing disease\". The virus infects new hosts by virus\nparticles shed from epithelial cells in the throat, and can\npersist in the host blood B cells for long times, in at\nleast three distinct latent states known as latency I, II\nand III. EBV is medically important primarily because\nsome cancer forms are invariably associated with the viral\ninfection [9].\nThe most vital EBV protein is EBNA-1, a transcription factor involved in replication, episome partitioning\nas well as gene regulation [10]. In latency I, EBNA-1 is\nproduced from RNA transcripts originating from the Q\npromoter on the EBV genome. EBNA-1 down-regulates\ntranscription from Qp by binding to sites downstream\nof the transcription start site [11]. In latency III, on the\nother hand, EBNA-1 is produced together with five other\nproteins by alternative splicing of a longer RNA transcribed from the EBV C promoter (Cp) [12]. EBNA-1\npositively regulates Cp activity by binding to the \"familyof-repeats\" (FR) region, positioned upstream of the start\nsite [13]. The physical description of this regulatory element is the topic of the present paper.\nThe FR region consists of 20 consecutive binding sites\nfor EBNA-1 [14]. There are minor variations in the DNA\nsequence among these sites, but they are all experimentally verified, and approximately equally strong, binding\nsites [15]. Comparing promoter activity, from constructs\nwith varying number of binding sites in FR, revealed that\nat least eight sites are necessary to have full transcriptional activation [5, 6], see Table IV. Recent studies have\nidentified an equal number of octamer binding sites at\nFR, juxtaposed with the EBNA-1 sites [16]. The action of the human transcription factor Oct-2 , identified\nas binding to these octamer sites complex with the cofactors Groucho/TLE, is believed to be inhibitory [17].\nIn summary, the Cp activity is largely regulated by\nbinding of two species of molecules, EBNA-1 and Oct-2.\nThey each can bind to 20 sites, and have antagonistic\n\neffects when bound. Due to the closely spaced binding\nsites, Oct-2 and EBNA-1 compete for binding to FR. It\nis however not experimentally known if one bound Oct2 blocks out one or both of the neighbouring sites for\nEBNA-1, and vice versa. The other unknown aspect is\nwhether there exists cooperative binding between EBNA1 proteins at FR, and if so, the strength of these interactions [18]. Therefor we explore the effects of cooperative\nbinding and blocking, with emphasis on how the effective\ncooperativity of the promoter switch is affected, i.e. the\nsharpness of the switch.\nIII.\n\nCOOPERATIVE BINDING AND\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe general thermodynamic framework is the following. Suppose a number of transcription factors T F1 ,\nT F2 ,. . . , T Fm can bind in different states indexed by s\naround the start of a gene. The number of transcription\nfactors of type T Fi bound in state s is ni (s), the association free energy is \u2206Gs , and the rate of transcription\nof the gene is Rs . Suppose further [T Fi ] is the concentration of transcription factor T Fi in the surrounding\ncytoplasm, in the form in which this transcription factor\nbinds. Then the binding sites, with or without bound\ntranscription factors, can be considered a small system,\nexchanging particles (transcription factors) and energy\nwith the larger reservoir. The probability of the small\nsystem being in state s is\nPs \u221d [T F1 ]n1 (s) * * * [T Fm ]nm (s) exp(\u2212\n\n\u2206Gs\n)\nRT\n\nand the net average rate of transcription is\nX\nR([T F1 ], . . . , [T Fm ]) =\nRs Ps\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\ns\n\nThe key assumption behind (2) is that the time scale\nat which the probabilities in (2) equilibrate is much\nfaster than the time scales at which the the concentrations [T F1 ], [T F2 ],. . . , [T Fm ] change appreciably.\nIn the present example, states can be labeled by\nn, the number of EBNA-1 molecules bound, k, the\nnumber of Oct-2 molecules bound, n1 , the number of\ncooperative bindings between bound EBNA-1 molecules\nand k1 , the number of cooperative bindings between\nbound Oct-2 molecules. Every such state has a binding\nfree energy of\n\u2206Gn,k,n1 ,k1 = nEE + kEO + n1 EE1 + k1 EO1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere EE = \u221215.45 kcal/mol [15] and EO = \u221212.28\nkcal/mol [19] are the known binding free energies of\nEBNA-1 and Oct-2 to binding sites in FR, and EE1 and\nEO1 are the unknown cooperative binding energies. In\nthe numerical experiments described in this paper we\n\n\f3\nonly examine EBNA-1 cooperativity. EE1 is proportional\nto EE in the range from 0 % (no cooperativity) up to 40\n%. The total probability of the states with given values\nof n, k, n1 and k1 is hence\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206Gn,k,n1 ,k1\nPn,k,n1 ,k1 \u221d \u03be(n, k, n1 , k1 )[E]n [O]k exp \u2212\nkB T\n(4)\nwhere \u03be(n, k, n1 , k1 ) is the number such states, and the\noverall rate of transcription is\n\nP =\n\nN N\n\u2212n n\u22121\n\u2212n\u22121\nX\nX\nX NX\n\nPn,k,n1 ,k1\n\n(5)\n\nn=8 k=0 n1 =0 k1 =0\n\nwhere N is the number of binding sites.\nAs described briefly in the introduction, one can imagine two plausible blocking scenarios at FR. The first and\nsimplest, is that each molecule bound hinders binding of\nthe competitive species to the closest neighbouring site on\none side. This is referred to a single-side blocking (Fig\n1a). The other scenario is that each bound molecule,\nsterically hinders both neighbouring sites for the other\nmolecule; a double-sided blocking (Fig 1b). The blocking\nmethod naturally affects the number of possible bound\nconfigurations, seen in Eq. 5. The upper bound in the\nsum over k is N \u2212 n in the single-side blocking model,\nbut at most N \u2212 n \u2212 1 in the double-side blocking model\nfor all n greater than zero. Similarly, the sums over n1\nand k1 may effectively go over smaller ranges e.g. in the\ndouble blocking scenario with both molecules bound and\nn + k = N \u2212 1 all EBNA-1 and Oct-2 molecules bind\ntogether in two groups, hence n1 = n \u2212 1 and k1 = k \u2212 1.\na)\n\n...OEEO...\n\nO\n\nb)\n\nE\n\nO\n\nE\n\nBrute-force counting of \u03be(n, k, n1 , k1 ) is not feasible as\nthe number of states in this model is up to 320 \u2248 3.4 * 109\n(in the model with single-side blocking only). Efficient\ncalculation of \u03be(n, k, n1 , k1 ) involves two aspects. First,\nelementary combinatorics is used to build up a paradigm\n\"balls-baskets\" problem. It counts, under different constrains, the number of ways that one can put certain\nnumber of balls into another number of baskets. Second, we find a way that can describe efficiently all effects\nincluding double-side blocking, cooperativity and combination of both in a three-step algorithm:\n1. Construct a backbone sequence (S0) made up by\ntwo types of baskets (bE , bO ), the two types of\nmolecules.\n2. Distribute n Es and k Os among these baskets,\nforming a sequence (S1) consisting only of E and\nO.\n3. Consider the front, end and the n+k\u22121 in-between\npositions of S1 as baskets (b\u03c6 ) for empty binding\nsites \u03c6. Insert N \u2212 (n + k) empty sites into these\npositions and get the final pattern (S2).\nBy setting N = 20, the actual number of sites is reduced by half, and the single-sided blocking model is the\ndefault. The double-side blocking is realized by setting\nthe b\u03c6 between an \"OE\" segment in S2 as must-be-filled\nbaskets (Fig 1b). The number of cooperative units, n1 ,\nare counted by recording number of \"EE\" in S2, minus\nthe number of b\u03c6 that have been filled with \u03c6.\nTo examine the effective cooperativity in the transition from P \u2248 0 to P \u2248 1 we compute the Hill\ncoefficient. This is the logarithmic derivative of the ratio\nof probability of transcription to the probability of no\ntranscription, with respect to the logarithm of the free\nligand concentration. The Hill coefficient is a function of\nthe ligand concentration, but the effective Hill coefficient\nis customarily taken at half saturation:\nP\nd lg 1\u2212P\n\n..O_EE...\n\nd lg[Ef ree ]\nO\n\nE\n\nE\n\nFIG. 1: Illustration of the two blocking scenarios.

The 40 binding sites are\nrepresented as 20 sites, where each site can be bound by E or\nO. b) The double-side blocking model where one bound E or\nO blocks the opposite molecular species binding on both sites.\nThe 20 sites can be bound by E or O, with the restriction that\nthere has to be an empty site between any bound O with a\nbound E on the right.\n\nat P = 0.5\n\n(6)\n\nIn this paper we explore the Hill coefficient functions\nto see how blocking and cooperative binding influence\nthe effective cooperativity of the switch. There are three\ncases studied; 1) cooperative binding of EBNA-1 and no\ncompeting molecular species, 2) cooperative binding of\nEBNA-1 with single-side blocking between the competing species, and 3) cooperative binding of EBNA-1 with\ndouble-side blocking between the competing species.\nIV.\n\nEFFECTIVE COOPERATIVITY OF THE\nSWITCH\n\nOne convenient way to visualize the cooperativity of\nP\nthe switch is as the ratio 1\u2212P\nvs. the local Hill coef-\n\n\f4\n\n14\n\nN=10\nN=15\nN=20\n12\n\nHill coefficient\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\u221210\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nlg(P/(1\u2212P))\n\nFIG. 2: Hill coefficient curves for three different numbers of\nbinding sites in the system; 10, 15 or 20. For each case, the\nlimit at low EBNA-1 concentrations (low P) is at Hill coefficient 8, since this is the definition of when the transcription\nis on at minimum. For the upper limit, at high P, the Hill\ncoefficient approaches N \u2212 7.\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\ns0\ns 1e\u221206\nd0\nd 1e\u221209\nd 1e\u221208\nd 1e\u221207\nd 1e\u221206\nd 1e\u221205\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the thermodynamic\nmodel of the switch is a (finite, one-dimensional) Isinglike model with three states at each site: bound by\nEBNA-1, bound by Oct-2, or free. The only complication in computing the \"ON\" probability (P ) is that only\nstates with enough bound EBNA-1 count, which mixes in\na global variable in the elementary statistical mechanical\nmodel. The single-blocking results can however be readily understood. With no cooperative binding and only\nsingle blocking, one can sum over k in (7) to obtain the\nmodel studied in [7], that is\n\nPn \u221d\n\n2\n\nlg(P/(1\u2212P))\n\nthree models. Without any cooperative interactions,\nand without competition, the effective Hill coefficient is\nsubstantially lower than both its limits. This baseline\nfunction for the system has an effective Hill coefficient\nof 3.5 (Fig 3, circled lines). This low Hill coefficient\nremains even with competition from Oct-2 binding,\nfor the single-side blocking, the effective cooperativity\npractically insensitive to Oct-2 levels. On the contrary,\ncompetition with double-side blocking dramatically\nalters the shape of the Hill coefficient curve, to a\nsigmoidal interpolation between the limits 8 and N \u2212 7.\nThe effective Hill coefficient then changes from 3.5 up\nto 10.5, for saturating amounts of Oct-2 (Fig 3, dotted\nlines).\n\n\u0012\n\nN\nn\n\n\u0013\n\n[E]n e\n\nEE\nBT\n\n\u2212n k\n\n\u0012\n\u0013N \u2212n\nE\n\u2212 O\n1 + [O]e kB T\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nIncluding the normalization this means\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\n\nPn =\n\n\u22128\n\n\u221210\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n\u0012\n\nN\nn\n\n\u0013\n\nEE\n\nzn\n(1 + z)N\n\n[E]e kB T\n\n\u0013\nz=\u0012\nE\n\u2212 k OT\n1 + [O]e B\n\n15\n\nHill coefficient\n\nFIG. 3: Hill coefficient curves for both single- and double-side\nblocking case. The circles correspond to the single-side blocking, where the Oct-2 concentration do not at all affect the effective cooperativity. On the other hand, in the double-sided\nblocking model, the Oct concentration dramatically alters the\ncooperativity of the switch. For saturating levels of Oct-2, the\neffective Hill coefficient approaches 10.5 (dotted black line).\n\nd lg\n\nP\n\nficient given as d lg[E1\u2212P\n. For very high and very low\nf ree ]\nconcentrations of EBNA-1, corresponding to very large\nand very small values of P , it is easy to see that in our\nmodel 1 \u2212 P \u223c A[Ef ree ]7\u2212N respectively P \u223c B[Ef ree ]8 .\nA and B are constants, and N is the total number of\nbinding sites in FR. Accordingly, the extreme local Hill\ncoefficients are N \u2212 7 and 8. Fig. 2 illustrates this limit\nbehaviour for three values of N .\nIn the region of main interest, where P \u223c 21 , the Hill\ncoefficient curves show very different behavior for the\n\n(8)\n\nand the ratio between ON and OFF probabilities is\ntherefore a function of the variable z only:\nP20 \u0010 N \u0011\n\nn\nn=8 n z\nP\n\u0010 \u0011\n= f (z)\n= P\n7\nN\n1\u2212P\nzn\nn=0\n\n(9)\n\nn\n\nThe local Hill coefficients are\nP\nd lg 1\u2212P\n\nd lg[Ef ree ]\n\n=\n\nd lg f (z)\nd lg z\n\n(10)\n\nP\ndepends on the concentration\nwhich like the ratio 1\u2212P\nof the second molecule [O] only through z. The effective\ncooperativity in the model without cooperative binding\nand only single blocking hence does not depend on [O],\nas shown in the curves in Fig 3. The Hill coefficient at\n\n\f5\n\nIn the model with double blocking on the other\nhand clearly the effective cooperativity can be much\nlarger, and also depend on [O]. That is easy to understand in the limit where [O] is large; if so EBNA-1\nand Oct-2 compete for binding sites, and the possibility\nthat a site is left free can be disregarded. Therefore,\nif n copies of EBNA-1 are bound, then also N \u2212 n\ncopies of Oct-2 are bound, altogether in the pattern\nEEEE * * * OOOO with statistical weight\nPn =\n\nxn\n1 + x + x2 + * * * xN\n\nx=\n\n[E]e\n[O]e\n\nEE\nkB T\nEO\nBT\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212k\n\nThe Hill coefficient is then only a function of x, such\nthat the curve in Fig 3 has a limit when [O] becomes\nlarge, and the value of the Hill coefficient at e.g. x = 1\nthen lies between the limits of 8 and 13. Competition\nwith a second molecule therefore makes the switch\nsharper for double-side blocking, in contrast to the\nsituation in single-sided blocking.\nThe case with cooperativity can be understood qualitatively, with the helix-coil model of protein physics. Without Oct-2, the statistical model can be written as a factor h = [E]e\nEcoop\nkB T\n\n\u2212\n\nEE +Ecoop\nkB T\n\nfor each letter E, and a penalty\n\nfor every start letter of a string of E's. In\nc = e\nan infinitely long string, the fraction of letters E as well\nas the frequency of initiation of a string of E's are calculated from the leading eigenvalue of the transfer matrix [20]. In our case, the interesting region is obviously\nwhen that fraction is around 40%, as 8 sites out of 20\nneed to be filled to have transcription from Cp. If c is\nclose to one, cooperative binding is weak, and the switch\nis similar to the single-blocking case discussed above. If\non the other hand c is much less than one, the expected\nfraction of letters E can be larger than 40%, while the expected frequency if initialization of a string of E's is less\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.9\n\n8\n\n0.8\n\n6\n\n0.7\n\n4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\nlg(P/(1\u2212P))\n\nis achieved at z \u2217 = ec/\u03c3 , and the Hill coefficient is\np\n8\u03c3 2 /\u03c0 \u2248 3.6 which accords quite well with the\nminimum value in Fig. 3. The switch is therefore much\nless sharp than the limits of 8 and N \u2212 7 = 13, at\nrespectively P \u2248 0 and P \u2248 1 could have led one to\nbelieve. We note that the sharpness increases with N\n(as long as the threshold stays around N/2), but only as\nthe square root of N : more than a hundred consecutive\nbinding sites are necessary to reach a Hill coefficient of\nabout ten in a model of this kind.\n\nthan once in twenty sites. Eventually, we would expect\nthat either all twenty sites are bound, or no sites in FR\nbe bound. This describes a situation where all twenty\nmolecules have to bind in simultaneously, in which case\nthe Hill coefficient is 20.\nThe addition of a cooperative binding of EBNA-1 to\nboth the single- and double sided model, hence changes\nthe effective Hill coefficient differently, depending on\nmodel. Fig 4 displays the curves for 5 different cooperative binding strengths, when no Oct-2 is competing\nfor the FR sites. The range of cooperative strength here\nis from 0 % up to 40 % of the DNA affinity, i.e \u2248 6.2\nkcal/mol, where the effective Hill coefficient is increased\nfrom 3.5 to 16.\n\nP\n\nP \u2248 12 can be estimated by approximating the binomials\nwith a Gaussian distribution, i.e.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n1\n2\n\u22121\nP \u2248C\nexp \u2212 2 (x \u2212 x\u0304) + x log z dx (11)\n2\u03c3\nx\u0304+c\u03c3\nq\n2\n\u03c32\nwhere, in the case at hand, C = e 2 log z 2\u03c0\n\u03c32 ,\nq\n\u221a\n2\nN\nN\n5 and c = \u2212 \u03c3 .

The cooperative binding is varied from 0-40 % of the DNA binding strength of EBNA-1. This range corresponds to 0-6.2\nkcal/mol in binding energies. With no competition and only\nadded cooperative interaction, the effective Hill coefficient\nchanges dramatically from 3.5 up to 16 for the 6.2 kcal/mol\ncooperative binding energy.\n\nHowever, in the real system the competitive protein\nOct-2 is likely to be present, perhaps even at very high\nconcentrations. As for the single-sided blocking, an\nadditional cooperative binding of EBNA-1 does not have\nthe same impact when Oct-2 levels are high. Instead\nof a 4-fold change, from 3.4 to 16, the effective Hill\ncoefficient is now only doubled, from 3.5 to 7 (compare\nFig 4 and 5, solid lines). This is to be compared with the\ndouble-sided blocking model, where even no cooperative\nbindings have a relatively high effective cooperativity.\nAdding up to 40 % cooperative binding strength, the\nHill coefficient is almost doubled, from 10.5 to 18 (Fig 3)\nA conclusion to draw from this is that to create an\neffective switch for genetic control, this type of architecture, with alternating binding sites for two antagonistic\nfactors, can be one approach. For EBV, the FR region\nis known for its enhancer function, as well as forming a\nlooped structure with another EBNA-1 binding region on\nthe viral genome; the dyad symmetry (DS) [21, 22].

If\nthe EBNA-1 binding sites in FR were to be arrange in\nthe same manner as in DS, i.e. much closer in space,\nthere might be cooperative bindings forming even at FR.\nHowever, since FR also seem to play an important role in\nforming a looped structure, there might be a structural\nreason behind these more sparsely placed sites, not enabling the same type of tight interactions. And, as we\nshow here, there is no need for cooperative interactions\nto get a sharp switch of Cp activity, as long as there is\nefficient steric hindrance.\n\nP\n\n6\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n\u22124\n\n0.2\n\n\u22126\n\n0 \u221212\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\nE\n\n1\n\n10\n8\n\n0.8\n\n6\n\n0.7\n\n4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\nlg(P/(1\u2212P))\n\nP\n\nfree\n\n0.9\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0\n\n\u22124\n\n0.2\n\n\u22126\n\n0 \u221212\n10\n\n[M]\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 12 14 16 18 20\n\nHill coefficient\n\nFIG. 6: Hill coefficient curves for the model with high concentration of the competitive molecular species (Oct), doubleside blocking and different strength of cooperative binding between EBNA-1.
