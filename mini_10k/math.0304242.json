A set of m positive integers {a1 , a2 , . . . , am } is\ncalled a D(n)-m-tuple (or a Diophantine m-tuple with the property D(n)) if\nai aj + n is a perfect square for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m.\nDiophantus himself found the D(256)-quadruple {1, 33, 68, 105}, while\nthe first D(1)-quadruple, the set {1, 3, 8, 120}, was found by Fermat (see\n[4, 5]). In 1969, Baker and Davenport [1] proved that this Fermat's set\ncannot be extended to a D(1)-quintuple, and in 1998, Dujella and Peth\u0151\n[10] proved that even the Diophantine pair {1, 3} cannot be extended to a\nD(1)-quintuple. A famous conjecture is that there does not exist a D(1)quintuple. We proved recently that there does not exist a D(1)-sextuple and\nthat there are only finitely many, effectively computable, D(1)-quintuples\n(see [7, 9]).\nThe question is what can be said about the size of sets with the property\nD(n) for n 6= 1. Let us mention that Gibbs [12] found several examples\nof Diophantine sextuples, e.g. {99, 315, 9920, 32768, 44460, 19534284} is a\nD(2985984)-sextuple.\nDefine\nMn = sup{|S| : S has the property D(n)}.\n0\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11D45, 11D09, 11N36.\nKey words and phrases.

On the other hand, if n 6\u2261 2 (mod 4) and n 6\u2208\n{\u22124, \u22123, \u22121, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20}, then Mn \u2265 4 (see [6]).\nIn [8], we proved that Mn \u2264 32 for |n| \u2264 400 and\nMn < 267.81 log |n| (log log |n|)2\n\nfor |n| > 400.\n\nThe purpose of the present paper is to improve this bound for Mn , specially\nin the case |n| > 400. We will remove the factor (log log |n|)2 , and also the\nconstants will be considerably smaller.\nThe above mentioned bounds for Mn were obtained in [8] by considering\nseparately three types (large, small and very small) of elements in a D(n)m-tuple. More precisely, let\nAn = sup{|S \u2229 [|n|3 , +\u221ei| : S has the property D(n)},\n\nBn = sup{|S \u2229 hn2 , |n|3 i| : S has the property D(n)},\nCn = sup{|S \u2229 [1, n2 ]| : S has the property D(n)}.\n\nIn [8], it was proved that An \u2264 21 and Bn < 0.65 log |n| + 2.24 for all\nnonzero integers n, while Cn < 265.55 log |n| (log log |n|)2 + 9.01 log log |n|\nfor |n| > 400 and Cn \u2264 5 for |n| \u2264 400. The combination of these estimates\ngave the bound for Mn .\nIn the estimate for An , a theorem of Bennett [2] on simultaneous approximations of algebraic numbers was used in combination with a gap principle,\nwhile a variant of the gap principle gave the estimate for Bn . The bound for\nCn (number of \"very small\" elements) was obtained using the Gallagher's\nlarge sieve method [11] and an estimate for sums of characters.\nIn the present paper, we will significantly improve the bound for Cn\nusing a result of Vinogradov on double sums of Legendre's symbols. Let\nus mention that Vinogradov's result, in a slightly weaker form, was used\nrecently, in similar context, by Gyarmati [14] and S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy & Stewart [17].\nWe will prove the following estimates for Cn .\nProposition 1 If |n| > 400, then Cn < 11.006 log |n|. If |n| \u2265 10100 , then\nCn < 8.37 log |n|.\nMore detailed analysis of the gap principle used in [8] will lead us to the\nslightly improved bounds for Bn .\nProposition 2 For all nonzero integers n it holds Bn < 0.6114 log |n| +\n2.158. If |n| > 400, then Bn < 0.6071 log |n| + 2.152.\n\n\fTHE SIZE OF SETS WITH THE PROPERTY D(n)\n\n3\n\nBy combining Propositions 1 and 2 with the above mentioned estimate\nfor An , we obtain immediately the following estimates for Mn .\nTheorem 1 If |n| \u2264 400, then Mn \u2264 31. If |n| > 400, then Mn <\n15.476, log |n|. If |n| \u2265 10100 , then Mn < 9.078 log |n|.\n\n2\n\nThree lemmas\n\nLemma 1 (Vinogradov) Let p be an odd prime and gcd(n, p) = 1.

Then Q > 848303 and we can\nprove in the same manner as above that n is divisible by at most 1% of the\nprimes \u2264 Q. This fact implies\n1.017c1\nE\n<\n* log N.\n\u221a\nF\n0.986 c1 \u2212 1\nFor c1 = 4.11 we obtain\n\nE\n< 4.185 log N.\n(5)\nF\nSetting N = n2 in (4) and (5), we obtain the statements of Proposition\n\n1.\n\n4\n\nProof of Proposition 2\n\nWe may assume that |n| > 1. Let {a, b, c, d} be a D(n)-quadruple such that\n2\nn2 < a < b < c < d. We apply Lemma 3 on the triple {b, c, d}. Since\n\u221a b>n\n2\nand bep\n+ n \u2265 0, we have that e \u2265 0. If e = 0, then d = b + c + 2 bc + n <\n2c + 2 c(c \u2212 1) + n < 4c, contradicting the fact that d > 4.89 c (see [8,\nLemma 5]).\nHence e \u2265 1 and\n\u221a\n2bc 2t bc\n.\n(6)\nd> b+c+ 2 +\nn\nn2\nLemma 3 also implies\nc \u2265 a + b + 2r.\n(7)\n\u221a\nFrom r 2 \u2265 ab \u2212 4 ab and ab \u2265 30 it follows that r >\u221a\n0.96 a, and (7) implies\nc > 3.92 a. Similarly, bc \u2265 42 implies t > 0.969 bc and, by (6), d >\nb + c + 3.938 nbc2 > 4.938 c + b.\nAssume now that {a1 , a2 , . . . , am } is a D(n)-m-tuple and n2 < a1 < a2 <\n* * * < am < |n|3 . We have\na3 > 3.92 a1 ,\n\nai > 4.938 ai\u22121 + ai\u22122 ,\n\nfor i = 4, 5, . . . , m.\n\nTherefore, am > \u03b1m a1 , where the sequence (\u03b1k ) is defined by\n\u03b1k = 4.938\u03b1k\u22121 + \u03b1k\u22122 ,\n\n\u03b12 = 1, \u03b13 = 3.92.\n\n(8)\n\nSolving the recurrence (8), we obtain \u03b1k \u2248 \u03b2\u03b3 k\u22123 , with \u03b2 \u2248 3.964355,\n\u03b3 \u2248 5.132825. More precisely,\n|\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 k\u22123 | <\n\n1\n.\n\u03b2\u03b3 k\u22123\n\n\f7\n\nTHE SIZE OF SETS WITH THE PROPERTY D(n)\nFrom |n|3 \u2212 1 \u2265 am > \u03b1m a1 \u2265 \u03b1m (n2 + 1), it follows \u03b1m \u2264 |n| \u2212\n\u03b2\u03b3 m\u22123 < |n|. Hence,\nm<\n\n1\nlog \u03b2\nlog |n| + 3 \u2212\n.\nlog \u03b3\nlog \u03b3\n\n1\n|n|\n\nand\n\n(9)\n\nFor the above values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 we obtain\nm < 0.6114 log |n| + 2.158.\nAssume now that |n| > 400. Then bc > ab > 4004 , which implies\nc > 3.999999 a and d > 4.999999 c + b. Therefore, in this case the relation\n(9) holds with \u03b2 \u2248 4.042648, \u03b3 \u2248 5.192581, and we obtain\nm < 0.6071 log |n| + 2.152.\n\nRemark 1 The constants in Theorem 1 can be improved, for large |n|, by\nP\nusing formula (2.26) from [16] in the estimate for the sum p\u2208S\n\u221a f (p). In\nthat way, it can be proved that for every \u03b5 > 0, F > (2 \u2212 \u03b5) Q \u2212 log N\nholds for sufficiently large Q.\nAlso, in the proof of Proposition 2, for sufficiently\nhave c >\n\u0012 large |n| we \u0013\n1\n\u221a\n+ \u03b5 log |n|.\n(4 \u2212 \u03b5)a and d > (5 \u2212 \u03b5)c + b, which leads to Bn <\nlog( 5+2 29 )\nThese results imply that for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists n(\u03b5) such that for\n|n| > n(\u03b5) it holds\n\u0012\n\nMn < 2 +\n\n1\n\n\u221a\n\nlog( 5+2 29 )\n\n\u0013\n\n+\u03b5\n\nlog |n|.\n\nAcknowledgements.
