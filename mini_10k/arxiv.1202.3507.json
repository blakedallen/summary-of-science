We show that self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of chiral\nmolecules are strong electron polarizers due to the high density effect of the monolayers and explicitly compute the scattering amplitude off a helical molecular model of carbon atoms. Longitudinal\npolarization is shown to be the signature of chiral scattering. For elastic scattering, we find that at\nleast double scattering events must take place for longitudinal polarization to arise. We predict energy windows for strong polarization, determined by the energy dependences of spin-orbit strength\nand multiple scattering probability. An incoherent mechanism for polarization amplification is proposed, that increases the polarization linearly with the number of helix turns, consistent with recent\nexperiments on DNA SAMs.\n\nThe surprising experimental finding that self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of chiral organic molecules on a\ngold substrate can act as highly efficient spin filters or polarizers, with a polarization factor larger than 60%[1], has\nprompted us to examine the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this behavior. In the absence of\nexternal fields, spin-dependent effects in electronic transport across an interface between two materials are essentially determined by electron-electron correlation and\nspin orbit (SO) interaction[2]. In the experiments we are\nreferring to, photoelectrons emitted from the gold surface are transmitted through the SAM at energies larger\nthan the interfacial tunneling barriers[1, 3]. Under these\nconditions electron transmission is mostly a one-particle\nprocess and therefore the explanation for the spin polarization effects must physically depend on either the presence of strong internal magnetic fields or the spin-orbit\ninteraction. We argue in this letter that the most striking experimental observations: the role of chirality and\nthe prevalence of longitudinal polarization, can be understood from a basic principles model using a one particle\nhamiltonian that includes the bare spin-orbit interaction.\nSpin-dependent electron scattering has been observed\nin gas phase experiments[4] with chiral molecules as targets, and the observed asymmetry factor for spin polarization can be well understood as due to the result of\na substantial spin-orbit interaction caused by a heavy\natom present in the molecule. A similar explanation can\nbe attempted for the experiments with SAMs[5], but the\nobjection has been raised that for the low atomic number atoms, C, H, N and O present in the monolayers,\nthe magnitude of the SO interaction is too small to explain the observed polarization[6]. In a very recent experiment reported by G\u00f6hler et al[1], a direct measurement\n\ndouble scattered\nelectrons\n\nz\n\nSelf assembled\nchiral monolayer\n\nkb\n\nb\n\nC\nka\nNormalized\nwavefunction box\n\n2a\n\nFIG. 1: Scattering model of a chiral assembly of molecules\nchemisorbed on a gold surface. Chiral molecules are assumed\nhelices of radius a and pitch b built from carbon atoms, whose\nelectronic state is fully described in the model. The electrons\nare incident in the z direction and are assumed to be scattered internally within the layer, and then received at a Mott\ndetector. Electron wavefunctions from surface are normalized\nwithin a rectangular box of volume v.\n\nof spin polarization with a strong longitudinal polarization was obtained for an unpolarized emerging electron\nbeam. This experiment establishes in a definitive way\nthat the SAM, composed of light atoms only, can polarize electrons regardless of the initial origin and magnitude of the electron polarization. We use a model for\nelastic spin-dependent multiple scattering through chiral\nmolecules to explain these experimental findings. Three\nkey ingredients emerge: (i) Although transverse polarization can arise under inelastic events from point targets, the appearance of longitudinal polarization requires\nthe existence of chirality. (ii) Strongly enhanced spin\n\n\f2\norbit interaction is due to the fact that the density of\nmolecules in a SAM is comparable to that of a solid\nstructure, thereby increasing the electron wavefunction\noverlap with deeply penetrating orbitals as compared to\nthe gas phase[4]. (iii) Multiple scattering is needed to\nproduce longitudinal polarization, so that there is an energy range where electron polarization is most effective in\nthe few electron volts range, as seen in the experiments.\nWe claim that sources of spin-orbit coupling analysed[7]\nsuch as electric polarization fields, even though as large as\n106 \u2212 107 V/cm[8]), cannot account for the spin-splitting\nenergy necessary for strong spin polarization. Such of\nSO also do not carry the field configuration to transfer\nthe appropriate longitudinal angular momentum to the\ntransmitted electrons. It is the wavefunction penetration\nto the nucleus in atomic orbitals that will yield electric\nfields of 1010 V/cm at distances of a Bohr orbit within the\natom. This is the source of the peculiar strength of SO\nin non-centrosymmetric semiconductors[9].\nThe detailed calculation of the scattering cross section and polarization of even a small molecule like H2 O\n[10] can be very demanding, taking into account static,\nexchange and spin-orbit interactions in detail. In order to capture the coherence effects by connecting them\nto molecular parameters, it is necessary to have analytical solutions to simpler models. In this paper we\nsolve explicitly for the scattering of electrons from a single oriented helical molecule[6], in a SAM as depicted\nin Fig.1, in the Born double scattering approximation.\nWe consider the elastic scattering of spin-quantized electrons from a chiral potential with explicit consideration\nfor the SO interaction and scalar potential effects from\nthe particular atomic centers that conform the molecular structure. We solve for the transition amplitude in\nthe scattering formulation where electrons are incident\nwith relative momentum k, and are subject to the potential V (r, \u03c3) = V (r)1 + \u03b1\u03c3\u0302. [\u2207V (r) \u2227 p], at position r,\nincluding both scalar and spin dependent contributions\nwith \u03b1 = \u2212 (2m~e c)2 the bare Pauli SO prefactor and V (r)\nthe atomic Coulomb potential.\nIn order to compute the scattering amplitudes, we need\nto expand the t matrix in powers of the potentials involved. In the double scattering approximation, and assuming non-overlapping multicentral potentials[11], we\nhave that for a multiatomic molecule assumed to be composed of carbon atoms C (1) through C (6)\nf\u0302 (ka , kb ) = \u2212\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0m\nh2\n\n\u0013 \u0010 helix\nX\nhkb |tC(l) |ka i\n\n(1)\n\nl\n\nhelix\nX\nl6=m\n\n\u0011\nhkb |tC (l) G0 tC (m) |ka i + ...... ,\n\nwhich includes both single and double scattering contributions. Here, ka , kb are the scattering incoming/outgoing wavevectors. The subindices of the single\n\nscattering t matrix correspond to the particular atom involved C (i) and G0 = exp(ik|rA \u2212 rB |)/4\u03c0|rA \u2212 rB | for\natomic centers A and B.

(ko \u2227 ki )] , (2)\nwhere ko , ki stand for collision input and output wavectors between any pair of atoms. The potentials have been\ntranslated to the origin, as their phase factors have been\nextracted from the integral. The denominator v represent a volume per molecule where the incident electron\nwavefunction is normalized, and \u0393(ki , ko ) is the expectation value of the atomic potential in the plane-wave\nbasis.\nNote a strong result from the above expression; no longitudinal polarization can result from single scattering\nevents no matter the symmetry of the potential since only\ntransverse components can arise (Pauli matrix components in the scattering plane). Nevertheless, double scattering events that result from products of single scattering amplitudes will contain all polarizations, as a result\nof the algebra of the Pauli matrices, physically controlling the transfer of orbital to spin angular momentum.\nThus, one needs to go beyond single scattering to gain\nlongitudinal polarization. Higher order scattering events,\nas we will see, have energy requirements that should be\nreflected in polarization experiments and will serve to\nprove their role. We also argue that higher order scattering is the only way to get chirality imprinted on the longitudinal spin signature. In view of the previous points,\nwe consider the molecular potentials as a superposition\nof their atomic nuclei, disregarding bonding effects[12].\nWe employ the wavefunctions of Clementi and Roetti[13],\nderived from a Hartree-Fock (HF) model, as convenient\nexpressions to simplify explicit calculations.\nThe situation of highly packed SAMs can be compared\nto that of semiconductors, in the sense that the major\npart of the SO interaction strength comes from probing electric fields close to the atomic cores. The SO retains the strength associated with individual atoms in\nthe solid[9], the spin splitting energy being very similar\n(0.006 eV for carbon[14]). We can correctly estimate the\nSO interaction, adjusting no parameters i.e. from the microscopic Hamiltonian, by calculating the single particle\namplitude as follows: We normalize the electron incident\nplane wave in a box whose volume is equivalent to the volume per molecule in the SAM. We then expand the plane\nwaves\nin the local atomic wavefunction basis; \u0393(ki , ko ) =\nP\n\u2032\nnl,n l\u2032 hko |\u03c6nl ih\u03c6nl |V (r)|\u03c6n\u2032 l\u2032 ih\u03c6n\u2032 l\u2032 |ki i, with |\u03c6nl i the\nHF wavefunctions and |ki,o i the input-output normalized plane wave vectors, and V (r) the bare Coulomb potential. This estimate has to be done for each incom-\n\n\f3\ning/outgoing wavevector combination, to properly account for momentum transfer and adding over the available orbitals of the target atoms which for carbon include 2p and higher levels with l 6= 0 that can contribute\nto the SO scattering strength. This procedure is a very\nsimple and robust approach that accounts for the correct\nspin splitting and the density effect of the scattering targets, and for the order of magnitude differences between\ngas phase polarization[4] and that resulting from electron\nscattering in the SAMs.\nIt is useful to rewrite the full scattering amplitude (one\nand two body scattering Eq. 1) in the form\n\u03bc \u0002\nh0 (ka , kb )1 + h1 (ka , kb )\u03c3x\nf\u0302 (ka , kb ) = \u2212\n2\u03c0~2\n\u0003\n+ h2 (ka , kb )\u03c3y + h3 (ka , kb )\u03c3z ,\n\n2(R(hl h\u20200 ) + R(ihm h\u2020n ))\n,\n|h0 |2 + |h1 |2 + |h2 |2 + |h3 |2\n\nPz\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the indices (l, m, n) are taken in cyclic order and R\ndenotes the real part of the argument. We immediately\nnote a central feature of polarization effects in electron\nscattering: It is an interference effect between the spinorbit interaction hi with i 6= 0 and the purely potential\nterm h0 . One needs the presence of both to guarantee\npolarization.\nIn Fig.2 we depict the electron polarization as a function of the pitch b of the discrete helix built from six\ncarbon atoms, that comprise a single turn of the structure. The range of k values considered is between 0 and\n1 a.u. (energies between 0 and 10 eV), in the range that\nhas been explored in polarization experiments[1]. For\nall values of the incident k, the longitudinal polarization\nvanishes as chirality, as measure by the pitch b, goes to\nzero. The relation between longitudinal polarization and\npitch constitutes a measure of chirality itself, although\nthe measure is obviously non-monotone, since there are\nimportant interference effects at play. The longitudinal\npolarization, can be of any sign depending on the range\nof wavevectors considered[4] and the magnitude of the\npitch of the scattering target. Note that one can achieve\npolarizations of 1% for k = 1 a.u. which is three orders of\nmagnitude larger than gas phase polarizations reported\nwith heavy atoms[4], and compatible with a comparable\nmolecule in a SAM, such as Lysine[3]. A molecule such\nas DNA contains a much larger number of atoms per\nturn and a double helix. It is beyond the scope of our\napproach to include such details in our model.\n\nk = 0.6 a.u.\na = 1.88 a.u\n\n2a\n\n-0.01\n-0.02\n\nb\n\n-0.03\n(\u00d710-1 )\n\n-2\n\n(\u00d710 ) 0.4\n\nPz\n\n0.15\n\nwhere the functions hi (ka , kb ) are to be determined.

No longitudinal polarization is obtained for b = 0 (chirality zero) for any\nvalue of the wavevector. The polarization is a non-monotonic\nfunction of b beyond a certain pitch. The inset (bottom panel)\nshows the change of the sign of the longitudinal polarization\nwhen chirality changes sign.\n\nTo assess the energy dependence of the polarization,\nthe best measure is the scattering probability in terms of\nthe components defined by Eq.3, since polarizations and\nasymmetries always yield a relative quantity to the total\nscattered intensity. In Fig.3 we see |h3 |2 i.e. the amplitude of the longitudinal polarization, as a function of the\nincident wavevector k and scattering angle \u03b8. One can\nreadily see that the relevant energy regime for chirality\neffects, in the double scattering approximation, are in the\nunits of eV range (in a.u. in the figure). Since longitudinal polarization requires at least double scattering, the\nelectrons must be deflected at large angles for intermediate dispersion events. Nevertheless, large deflections can\nonly occur with the denominator handicap \u221d |ko \u2212 ki |3\nthe momentum transfer. If k is increased by a factor of\ntwo, the spin-orbit interaction effects can be reduced by\nan order of magnitude, concomitantly reducing longitudinal polarization. There is a corresponding effect at lower\nk where the spin-orbit interaction decreases linearly. So\nthere will be a peak range in energies where longitudinal\npolarization is observed.\nUp to this point we have only computed the polarizing\npower of a single turn of the helix under double scatter-\n\n\f4\n\n| h 3(k a ,k b ,e) |\n\n2\n\ning conditions. Successive turns of the helix or additional\nlayers of chiral molecules can be treated incoherently by\nassuming layers of one helix turn thick. Since all scattering occurs at room temperature in the experiments,\none does not expect long coherence lengths beyond a few\nnanometers. The scattering is then presumed to proceed\nby successive incoherent double scatterings through different turns of the helix. This can involve either the same\nhelix or the ones within the lateral distance defined by\nthe transverse component of the wavevector of the electrons emitted from the surface.\n\n10\n5\n0\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\nk (a.u.)\n\n-2\n\n\u03b8(\u03c0 radian)\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 3: The unnormalized probability amplitude for longitudinal polarization as a function of the incident wavevector and\nangular dependence.

Figure 4\nshows the polarization as a function of the number of\nhelix turns for two different pitches smaller than the helix radius. We see a linear growth of the longitudinal\npolarization, proportional to the pitch size. The linear\nbehavior, in spite of the complex relation between different components of the polarization, lends support for incoherent amplification. For larger pitch values, however,\nthe relation between different components of the polarization can make the amplification non-monotonous, changing the polarization sign as the number of turns increase.\nThe same mechanism can be envisaged for stacked lysine\nSAMs[3].\nSummarizing, we have presented an elastic scattering\nscenario to describe spin-orbit interaction based polarization of electrons in chiral SAMs. The crux of our model\nis to consider multiple scattering off a helical model built\nfrom carbon atoms, disregarding bonding effects. The\nanalytical approach, albeit consideration of only double scattering events, allows understanding the underpinnings of longitudinal polarization, the energy windows\ninvolved and the role of the chiral parameter. We have\naccounted for the strength of the SO interaction from\nthe microscopic interactions by projecting the normalized plane waves onto the available atomic orbitals of\nthe carbon scattering centers. This approach has no adjustable parameters and accounts directly for the SAM\n\nkb\n\n0.04\n\n\u0003\n\n2I\n\u2212\n\nh\n\n\u0001 i\uf8f6\nh \u00d7 P (i) h\u20200\n\uf8f8,\n|h0 |2 + |h|2\n\n(5)\n\nPz\nb=0.15\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\nka\n\n0.01\n\nb=0.1\n\n0.00\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nTurns\nFIG. 4: The longitudinal polarization as a function of the\nnumber of turns in the helix for b < a = 1.88 a.u. and k =\n1 a.u.

Double and higher order scattering will be significant only within an energy window due to momentum\ntransfer denominators that hinder the lateral scattering\nnecessary to explore the target molecule. Finally, the\nshort coherence lengths for electrons at room temperature, lead to the scenario that the linear increase of the\nlongitudinal polarization with chiral chain lengths[1] is\ndue to incoherent multiple forward scattering.\n\n\f5\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge R.
