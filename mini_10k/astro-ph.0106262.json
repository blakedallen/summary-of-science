Age consistency for the Universe today has been an important cosmological test. Even more powerful consistency tests at times as\nearly as 10\u221232 sec lie ahead in the precision era of cosmology. I outline\ntests based upon cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, bigbang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particle dark matter, phase transitions, and\ninflation. The ultimate cosmic timescale \u2013 the fate of the Universe \u2013 will\nbe in doubt until the mystery of the dark energy is unraveled.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe cosmic clock ticks logarithmically. The Universe's past can be divided into\nthree well defined epochs: the quantum era (10\u221242 sec to 10\u221222 sec); the quark\nera (10\u221222 sec to 10\u22122 sec); and the hot big-bang era (10\u22122 sec to 1017 sec). Earlier than the quantum era is the Planck era (t < 10\u221242 sec); it holds the key\nto understanding the birth of the Universe, but requires a quantum theory of\ngravity to proceed. Just recently the Universe has entered a new era, of undetermined duration, where dark energy and its repulsive gravity are dominating\nthe dynamics of the Universe (more later).\nThe third era derives its name from the very successful cosmological model\nthat describes it; the important events include the synthesis of the light elements,\nthe last scattering of radiation, the formation of large-scale structure and the\nonset of accelerated expansion. The earlier two eras are still largely terra incognita, though we have some tantalizing ideas: the transition from quark/gluon\nplasma to hadronic matter, the electroweak phase transition, and the birth of\nparticle dark matter during the quark era; and inflation and the origin of the\nmatter \u2013 antimatter asymmetry during the quantum era (see Figure).\nThere is no doubt that cosmology is in the midst of the most exciting\nperiod ever. Progress in understanding the origin and evolution of the Universe\nis proceeding at a stunning pace. I mention a few of the highlights of the\npast decade: COBE discovery of the small density inhomogeneities (\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u223c\n10\u22125 ) that seeded large-scale structure, the mapping of CMB anisotropy on\nscales down to 0.1 degree and the determination of the shape of the Universe\n1\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n\n2\n\n(flat!), identification of the epoch of galaxy formation, determination of the\nHubble parameter to a precision of 10%, and the discovery of cosmic accelerated\nexpansion.\nThere is much more to come. These recent discoveries and those still to\nbe made will test the framework of the standard cosmology and begin to open\nthe quark and quantum eras. We are already on the way to establishing a\nnew standard cosmology: a flat Universe comprised of 2/3rds dark energy and\n1/3rd dark matter that is accelerating today and whose seeds for structure came\nfrom quantum fluctuations stretched to astrophysical size during inflation. Much\nremains to be done to put the new cosmology on the same firm footing as the hot\nbig-bang model; much of cosmology over the next two decades will be devoted\nto this (see e.g., Turner, 2001a).\nThe richness and redundancy of the measurements to be made will also\nallow a number of consistency tests of the big-bang framework and its theoretical\nfoundation, general relativity. Many of these tests involve cosmic timescales, and\nthat is the subject of my talk.\n2.\n\nH0 t0 : \"Sandage Consistency Test\"\n\nThe product of the present age and Hubble constant is a powerful consistency\ntest. The standard hot big bang has not always cleared this hurdle, cf. the late\n1940s when the Hubble age of about 2 billion years fell short of the age of the\nsolar system by a factor of two (see e.g., Kragh, 1996) or the more recent scares\nwhen some measurements of H0 and t0 drifted upward.\nRecognizing the importance of age consistency, Sandage has devoted much\nof his career to measuring the Hubble constant H0 and independent indicators\nof the age of the Universe (and pioneered many of the methods); hence the title\nof this section.\nThe nature of the test has changed over Sandage's career; the importance\nhas not. Until recently one would have written H0 t0 in terms of one parameter,\n\u03a9M , the fraction of critical density in matter, also assumed to be the total\nfraction of critical density contributed by all forms of matter and energy (\u2261\n\u03a90 ). The discovery of accelerated expansion increased the number of parameters\nto two, \u03a9M and \u03a9\u039b (fraction of critical density in a cosmological constant;\n\u03a90 = \u03a9M + \u03a9\u039b ). The realization that accelerated expansion is here to stay,\nwhile the cosmological constant may not, added another parameter, w = pX /\u03c1X\n(the equation-of-state of the dark energy) (see below). The determination from\nCMB anisotropy measurements that the Universe is flat, effectively reduced the\nnumber of parameters to two, \u03a9M and w:\nH 0 t0 =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nf (\u03a90 )\nf (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b )\nf (\u03a9M , \u03a9X , w)\nf (\u03a9M , w)\nf (w)\n\n\u2192 1998\n1998 \u2192 1999\n1999 \u2192 2000\n2000 \u2192 ?\n? \u2192 ?\n\nFor the first two cases, there are well known analytic formulae for f ; for the\nothers there are not.\n\n\f3\n\n... at the Beginning\n\nThere is hope, that in the next ten years \u03a9M will be pinned down by a\ncombination of CMB, cluster and large-scale structure measurements, reducing\nthe number of parameters to one again. At the moment, my analysis of this data\ngives, \u03a9M = 0.33 \u00b1 0.035 (Turner, 2001b), and I believe there will be significant\nimprovement over the next decade.\nThe function f that accounts for the effect of slowing/speeding up on the\nage of the Universe is given by (for a coasting universe f = 1):\nf \u2261 H 0 t0 =\n\nZ\n\nH(z)/H0 =\n\nh\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndz\n(1 + z)H(z)/H0\n\n\u03a9M (1 + z)3 + \u03a9X (1 + z)3(1+w) + (1 \u2212 \u03a90 )(1 + z)2\n\ni1/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the small contribution from the CMB and relativistic neutrinos (\u03a9R \u223c\n10\u22124 ) has been neglected and w has been assumed to be constant.\nTo illustrate the status of this test, for H0 and t0 I will use the values\nreported at this meeting, H0 = 72 \u00b1 7 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Freedman, 2001) and\nt0 = 13.5 \u00b1 1.5 Gyr (Chaboyer, 2001). This leads to\nH0 t0 = 0.94 \u00b1 0.14\nTaking \u03a90 = 1 and \u03a9M \u2243 0.35, this is consistent with w < \u2212 13 (at 1\u03c3) \u2013 the\nnew cosmology passes the Sandage consistency test with flying colors! While\nnot a tight constraint on w, it does provides more evidence for dark energy\n(i.e., a smooth component with large, negative pressure): if the dark energy\nwere pressureless (w = 0), then H0 t0 = 2/3, which is clearly inconsistent with\ncurrent data.\nAt present, the Sandage test has a precision of about 15%; what kind of\nimprovement could one hope for over the next decade. Together, physics-based\nmeasures of H0 (especially the CMB) and distance scale measures might well pin\ndown the Hubble constant to a few percent. However, it is difficult to imagine\nindependent measures of the age achieving similar accuracy. One irreducible\nuncertainty for all methods, is the time to formation (of stars, globular clusters,\nwhite dwarfs, etc). Reducing this uncertainty to 0.5 Gyr would still leave a 5%\nuncertainty in H0 t0 . As I will discuss, other tests of age consistency, at much\nearlier times, are likely to be significantly more precise.\n2.1.\n\nMapping the expansion rate\n\nThe expansion rate at any epoch is related to the age of the Universe. For\nexample: during a matter-dominated epoch, the scale factor R(t) \u221d t2/3 and t =\n2/3H(t); and during a radiation-dominated epoch R(t) \u221d t1/2 and t = 1/2H(t).\nThe expansion rate is more accessible than the age at early times.\nThe expansion rate determines a key observable: the comoving distance to\nan object a redshift z,\nZ z\ndz\nH0 r(z) =\n(2)\n0 H(z)/H0\nwhere a flat Universe has been assumed. The cosmological volume element,\nluminosity distance and angular-diameter distance are all directly related to\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n\n4\n\nr(z)\ndV /dzd\u03a9 = r(z)2 /H(z)\ndL = (1 + z)r(z)\ndA = r(z)/(1 + z)\nA number of probes of the expansion history from z = 0 to z \u223c 2 have been\ndiscussed recently. They include gathering a large sample of type Ia supernovae\n(SNAP) and counting halos or clusters of galaxies. From these \"experiments,\"\nindividually or taken together, one could imagine mapping out H(z) back to\nredshift z \u223c 2 (see e.g., Huterer & Turner, 2000; or Tegmark, 2001). Note that\nthe volume element and luminosity distance taken together, can in principle\ndirectly yield H(z).\nLoeb (1998) has gone one step further, suggesting ultra-precise redshift\nmeasurements of the Lyman-alpha forest over a decade or more could be used\nto determine H(z) directly(!). The idea is to measure the tiny time variation of\nthe redshifts of thousands of Lyman-alpha clouds,\n\u03b4z = [\u2212H(z1 ) + (1 + z1 )H0 ]\u03b4t\n\u223c 0.2 (\u03b4t/10 yrs) m sec\u22121\nfor z = 3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4t is the time interval of the observations. Whether or not this bold idea\ncan be carried out remains to be seen, but it certainly is exciting to think about.\n3.\n\nCMB anisotropy and acoustic peaks\n\nAs is now very familiar, the power spectrum (in multipole space) of CMB\nanisotropy arises due to acoustic oscillations in the baryon \u2013 photon fluid around\nthe time of last scattering (see e.g., Hu et al, 1997). At this time, the baryons\n(and electrons) are falling into the dark-matter potential wells; still coupled to\nphotons (through Thomson scattering off electrons), the infall is resisted by photon pressure and oscillations ensue. At maximum compression the photons are\nheated and at maximum rarefaction they are cooled.\nThe CMB is a snapshot of the Universe at 400,000 yrs; regions caught at\nmaximum compression (rarefaction) lead to hot (cold) spots on the microwave\nsky. While the physics is most easily explained in real space, the signal is best\nseen in multipole space, as a series of peaks and valleys. The power at multipole\nl is largely due to k-modes satisfying: k \u223c lH0\n\u221a\nThe condition for maxima in the power spectrum is: \u03c9n tLS / 3 = n\u03c0,\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3 * * *; the odd peaks are compression peaks and the even peaks\nare rarefaction peaks, \u03c9 = (1 + zLS )k is the physical oscillation frequency at the\ntime of last scattering, and tLS \u2243 400, 000 yrs is the age of the Universe then.\nThus, in a flat Universe, the harmonic peaks occur at multipoles\nn\u03c0\n\u223c 200n\nln \u223c\nH0 tLS (1 + zLS )\nWhile the above formulae are approximate, they capture the physics. In\nparticular, that the positions of the peaks depends upon the age of the Universe at last scattering. There will be sufficient redundancy in the information\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n\n5\n\nencoded in the 3000 or so multipole amplitudes that will be measured to not\nonly determine cosmological parameters, but also to check the consistency of\nthe standard relationship between age and energy density.\nIn particular, an analysis by Lopez et al (1999) has projected that the Planck\nmission will be able to peg the neutrino contribution to the energy density of\nthe Universe at last scattering to about 1%. The expansion rate is related to\nthe energy density, H 2 = 8\u03c0G\u03c1/3, and neutrinos contribute about 1/5th of\nthe total energy density at the time of last scattering. A quick estimate from\nLopez et al (1999) indicates that ultimately, CMB anisotropy will provide an\nage consistency test at about 0.1% precision, 400,000 yrs after the beginning.\nThe limitations of this test should be noted however. Actually determining\nthe age of the Universe at last scattering, whose redshift is readily determined\nby thermodynamic considerations (1 + zLS ) \u2243 1100), is pegged to the present\nHubble constant, tLS \u2243 H0\u22121 /[\u03a9M (1+ zLS )3/2 , and thus can be no more accurate\nthan the age of the Universe itself. The CMB consistency above actually probes\nthe relationship between expansion rate and the energy density of the Universe,\na test of the big-bang framework and general relativity.\n4.\n\nBig-bang Nucleosynthesis\n\nBig-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is a cosmological experiment of great importance. In essence, it is a quenched nuclear reactor whose by-products are the\nprimeval mix from which the first generation stars were born.\nThe expansion rate of the Universe controls the quench rate: |\u1e6a /T | = H.\nThe yields of D, 3 He, 4 He and 7 Li, the primary products of BBN, are sensitive\nto the quench rate, and thus to the expansion rate\n\u03b4X\n\u03b4H\n\u223c\nX\nHSTD\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the coefficient of proportionality varies from about 1.5 for 7 Li to about\n0.6 for 4 He.\nMeasurements of the primeval deuterium abundance (see e.g., O'Meara et\nal, 2001) together with predictions for its BBN yield pin down the baryon density,\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.02 \u00b1 0.001 (Burles et al, 2001a). Using this value, the other lightelement abundances can be predicted, e.g., YP = 0.2472 \u00b1 0.0005. Of the four\nlight elements, the primeval 4 He abundance is known most accurately, YP =\n0.244 \u00b1 0.002 (though there is still much debate about systematic error; see e.g.,\nBurles et al, 2001b, or Olive et al, 2000).\nThe sensitivity of the 4 He abundance to the expansion rate is: \u03b4YP =\n0.15(\u03b4H/HSTD ). The current agreement of prediction with observation translates to a 2% test of the consistency of the big-bang prediction for the expansion\nrate around 1 sec, or about 5 times better than the Sandage test! With improved\nmeasurements of the baryon density, both from BBN and CMB anisotropy (see\nbelow), one might hope to see an improvement of a factor of five or so in the\nnext decade.\nFinally, as Carroll & Kaplinghat (2001) have recently emphasized, BBN can\nbe discussed without reference to the standard cosmological model. The yields\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n\n6\n\ncan be analyzed completely in terms of the quench rate, |\u1e6a /T |, and nuclear input\ndata with only the assumption of the Robertson \u2013 Walker line element (and not\nthe Friedmann equations which relate the quench rate to the temperature).\nBBN not only offers a window on the very early Universe, but an almost modelindependent timescale test.\n5.\n\nCMB + BBN and the Baryon Density\n\nTogether, the CMB and BBN offer a remarkable test of the consistency of the\nstandard cosmology and general relativity. As mentioned in the previous section, measurements of the primeval deuterium abundance together with precise\ntheoretical predictions can be used to infer the baryon density:\n\u03a9B (BBN)h2 = 0.02 \u00b1 0.001\n\n(5)\n\nSince the first measurements of the primeval deuterium abundance in 1998, BBN\nhas provided the best determination of the baryon density (see e.g., Schramm\n& Turner, 1998).\nThe CMB provides an independent measure of the baryon density based\nupon the physics of gravity-driven acoustic oscillations 400,000 yrs after BBN.\nSpecifically, it is the ratio of the heights of the odd to even acoustic peaks that\nis sensitive to the baryon density (and insensitive to other cosmic parameters;\nsee e.g., Hu et al, 1997). The ratio of the heights of the first and second peaks\nis\n\u0010\n\u00112/3\npeak1\n(6)\n\u2243 2 \u03a9B h2 /0.02\npeak2\nwhere the peak heights are measured in microKelvin2 .\nThe Boomerang and Maxima experiments were the first CMB experiments\nto probe the first and second peaks (and to show that the Universe is flat; de\nBernardis et al, 2000; Hanany et al, 2000); based upon their results a value for\nthe baryon density was inferred (Jaffe et al, 2001)\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.032+0.005\n\u22120.004\nWhile this baryon density is about 2\u03c3 higher than the BBN value, it confirmed\na key prediction of BBN \u2013 a baryon density far below that of the best estimates\nof the total matter density (\u03a9M \u223c 0.3 vs. \u03a9B \u223c 0.05).\nOnly a couple of months after this meeting, Carlstrom's DASI experiment at\nthe South Pole announced even more accurate and independent measurements\nof the first three acoustic peaks (Pryke et al, 2001) and arrived at a slightly\nlower baryon density:\n\u03a9B (CMB)h2 = 0.022+0.004\n(7)\n\u22120.003\nwhich is bang on the BBN value! Boomerang analyzed more data and refined\ntheir beam map and pointing model and arrived at an identical value (Netterfield\net al, 2001).\nThe agreement between these two numbers is stunning. Using the fact that\n(D/H)P \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 (\u03a9B h2 /0.02)\u22121.6 and the sensitivity of D/H to the expansion\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n\n7\n\nrate,\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4(D/H)\n\u2243 1.4\n,\n(D/H)\nHSTD\nit follows that\n\n\u03b4(\u03a9B h2 )\n\u03b4H\n\u223c \u22120.9\n2\n\u03a9B h\nHSTD\nThus, the agreement of the BBN and CMB baryon densities checks the consistency of the standard expansion rate (at about 1 sec) to a precision of about 15%.\nEventually, both determinations of the baryon density should achieve about 1%\nor so accuracy, and a factor of ten in the precision of this test might be expected.\n6.\n\nParticle Relics\n\nThe evidence for particle dark matter has only gotten stronger: firmer evidence\nfor \u03a9B \u226a \u03a9M (discussed above); the many successes of the CDM scenario\nof structure formation (and no viable model for structure formation without\nparticle dark matter); the detection of acoustic peaks as predicted by inflation\nand CDM (Netterfield et al, 2001; Pryke et al, 2001); and growing circumstantial\nevidence for supersymmetry.\nThe most promising particle candidate is the lightest supersymmetric particle, which in most models is a neutralino of mass 100 to 300 GeV (see e.g.,\nJungman et al, 1996). Relic neutralinos remain numerous today because of the\nincompleteness of neutralino annihilations in the early Universe.\nAt temperatures when kT \u226b m\u03c7 c2 , neutralinos and anti-neutralinos are\npresent in numbers comparable to that of photons; as the temperature drops\n2\nneutralinos must annihilate to maintain thermal abundance (a factor e\u2212m\u03c7 c /kT\nless than that of photons). Eventually, annihilations cannot keep pace with\nthe quench rate (the annihilation rate per neutralino, \u0393 = n\u03c7 < \u03c3v >ann , falls\nrapidly as the neutralino abundance decreases exponentially) and the neutralino\nabundance \"freezes out.\" Freeze out occurs at a temperature, kTf \u223c m\u03c7 c2 /30,\ncorresponding to a time of around 10\u22127 sec. The mass density contributed by\nrelic neutralinos is given by\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u221d\n\nH(kT \u223c m\u03c7 c2 /30)\n< \u03c3v >ANN\n\n(8)\n\nWhile an approximation, this formula captures the essence of the neutralino\nproduction process (see e.g., Kolb & Turner, 1990).\nHere is the future timescale test: \u03a9\u03c7 h2 will be measured by CMB anisotropy\nexperiments to percent level precision. The properties of the neutralino can be\nmeasured at an accelerator lab (next linear collider?) to 10% precision (Brhlik\net al, 2001). From this, the expansion rate at kT = m\u03c7 c2 /30 can be inferred and\ncompared to the standard formula. (To be more precise, the measured properties\nof the neutralino and the Boltzmann equation in the expanding Universe can\nbe used to predict the relic mass density and compared with the value inferred\nfrom CMB measurements.) If the neutralino is indeed the dark-matter particle\n(or another particle that can be produced in the lab), we can look forward to a\n10% consistency test of the expansion rate at a time of less one microsecond!\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n7.\n\n8\n\nPhase Transitions\n\nIf current ideas about particle physics are correct, then, during its earliest moments, the Universe should have gone through a series of phase transitions associated with symmetry breaking (e.g., QCD, electroweak, grand unification,\ncompactification?). During a first-order phase transition, the Universe gets\n\"shaken up\" as bubbles of the new phase expand and collide. This can lead\nto the production of prodigious amounts of gravitational radiation, resulting in\n\u03a9GW h2 \u223c 10\u221210 today. Laboratory-based knowledge of particle physics (e.g.,\nfor the electroweak phase transition, the mass of the Higgs boson) can be used\nto predict with precision the spectrum and amount of gravitational radiation\n(Kosowsky, Turner & Watkins, 1992); both depend directly upon the expansion\nrate at the temperature at which the phase transition takes place. If the stochastic background of gravitational waves from a phase transition can be detected\nand the particle physics independently probed in the laboratory a cosmological\ntimescale test can be carried out at very early times (e.g., for the electroweak\nphase transition, t \u223c 10\u221211 sec).\n8.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation also produces gravitational waves, by a different mechanism \u2013 deSitterspace produced quantum fluctuations in the space-time metric. The stochastic\nbackground of gravity waves produced by inflation have wavelengths from 1 km\nto the beyond the size of the present horizon. Gravity waves are one of the\nthree key predictions of inflation (together with a flat Universe and a nearly\nscale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic, Gaussian density perturbations; see e.g.,\nTurner, 1997a).\nDetection of gravitational waves, either by their imprint on CMB anisotropy\nand/or polarization or directly by a gravity-wave detector (LIGO?, LISA?),\nwould not only confirm a key prediction of inflation, but would also reveal the\ntimescale for inflation: The level of gravitational radiation produced by inflation\nis directly related to the expansion rate during inflation:\nhGW \u223c HI /mPl\nMeasuring the dimensionless metric strain hGW gives the Hubble parameter\nduring inflation in units of the Planck energy (= 1.22 \u00d7 1019 GeV). Further, if\nthe spectrum of gravitational radiation can be probed, then there is a consistency\ntest of inflation (and cosmology): T /S = \u22125nT , where T (S) is the contribution\nof gravity waves (density perturbations) to the quadrupole CMB anisotropy, and\nnT is the spectral index of the inflation-produced gravitational waves (Turner,\n1997a,b).\nAs a practical matter, gravity waves from inflation can probably only be\ndetected if HI > 3 \u00d7 1012 GeV, corresponding to a timescale of HI\u22121 < 10\u221230 sec.\nSaid another way, if gravity waves from inflation are detected we will be probing\nthe Universe at a time at least as early as 10\u221230 sec.\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n9.\n\n9\n\nDark energy & destiny\n\nFor decades cosmologists have believed that geometry (or equivalently \u03a90 ) and\nthe fate of the Universe were linked. The shape of the Universe has been determined through measurements of CMB anisotropy, \u03a90 = 1.0 \u00b1 0.04 (Pryke et\nal, 2001; Netterfield et al, 2001; Hanany et al, 2001), but we are further away\nthan ever from determining the destiny of the Universe. This is because 2/3rds\nof the critical density is in dark energy rather than matter, and the connection\nbetween geometry and destiny only applies when the Universe is comprised of\nmatter (or more precisely, stress-energy with p > \u2212\u03c1/3; see Krauss & Turner,\n1999).\nThe discovery of accelerated expansion through type Ia supernovae distance\nmeasurements (see Tonry, 2001) was surprising, but can easily be accommodated\nwithin the framework of general relativity and the hot big-bang cosmology: In\ngeneral relativity, the source of gravity is \u03c1 + 3p, so that a fluid that is very\nelastic (negative pressure comparable in magnitude to energy density) has repulsive gravity. The simplest example is the quantum vacuum (mathematically\nequivalent to a cosmological constant), for which p = \u2212\u03c1.\nUnfortunately, all estimates of the energy of the quantum vacuum exceed by\nat least 55 orders-of-magnitude what is required to explain the acceleration of the\nUniverse, suggesting to many that \"nothing weighs nothing\" and that something\nelse with large negative pressure is causing the accelerated expansion (e.g., a\nrolling scalar field, aka as mini inflation or quintessence, or a frustrated network\nof cosmic defects; see Turner, 2000 or Carroll, 2001). Borrowing from Zwicky,\nI have coined the term \"dark energy\" to describe this stuff, which is clearly\nnonluminous and more \"energy like\" than \"matter like\" (since |p|/\u03c1 \u223c 1). It\nseems to be very smoothly distributed and its primary effect is on the expansion\nof the Universe. The first handle we will have in determining its nature is\nmeasuring its equation-of-state w = p/\u03c1 through cosmological observations (see\ne.g., Huterer & Turner, 2000).\nUntil we figure out the nature of the dark energy, the ultimate timescale\nquestion is on hold. Accepting that the Universe is flat (or at least that our\nbubble is; see Guth, 2001), the possibilities for destiny are wide open: continued\naccelerated expansion (and the almost complete \"red out\" of the extragalactic\nsky in 150 billion years) if the dark energy is vacuum energy; eternal slowing if\nthe dark energy dissipates and matter takes over the dynamics; or even recollapse\nif the dark energy dissipates revealing a small, negative cosmological constant\n(Krauss & Turner, 1999).\n10.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nCosmology is in the midst of a Golden Age (see e.g., Turner, 2001a). As this\nmeeting has illustrated, other areas of astronomy have not been left behind\neither. Astronomy in general is in the midst of the most exciting period of\ndiscovery ever.\nThe enormous variety and range of timescales in astrophysics makes the\nsubject rich. Cosmology provides an especially good illustration, because the\ncosmological clock ticks logarithmically. Consistency checks on the cosmological\n\n\f... at the Beginning\n\n10\n\nclock have and will continue to play an important role in validating the standard\ncosmological model. While the consistency of the present age and expansion rate\n(Sandage test) is important and will improve in accuracy, from its present 15%\nto perhaps 5%, there are many other age consistency tests in cosmology, whose\nprecision may well approach a few tenths of a percent (e.g., BBN and CMB),\nand extend to times as early as 10\u221230 sec.\nReferences\ndeBernardis, P. et al 2000, Nature 404, 955\nBrhlik, M., Chung, D. & Kane, G. 2001, Intl.
