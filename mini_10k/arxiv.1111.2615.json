Although those electroweak\nparticles could appear in the cascade decay of heavier colored objects, the discovery reach\ndepends strongly on the mass scale of the colored ones. Current LHC searches in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) are mostly focused on the direct pair\nproduction of squarks and gluinos. Null search results from both ATLAS and CMS [1\u20135]\nalready exclude the mass of those colored particles up to about 800 GeV. It is likely that\nthose colored particles are so heavy that they are out of the reach of the LHC. In this paper,\nwe consider the direct production of the electroweak sector of the MSSM. In particular, we\nfocus on the LHC reach for the discovery of the sleptons. A complementary study on the\nLHC reach in the neutralino and chargino sector with decoupled sleptons can be found in\nRef. [6].\nIf low energy supersymmetry is realized in the nature, sleptons are likely to be light.\nThis happens in the Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenarios [7], as\nwell as the Anomaly Mediated SUSY breaking scenarios [8], in which the slepton masses are\nproportional to the electroweak gauge couplings. Even in the minimal Gravity Mediated\nSUSY breaking scenarios (mSUGRA) [9] where all the scalars have a common mass m0\nat some high energy scale, renormalization group running to low energies typically pushes\nup the squark mass (due to the contributions of strongly interacting gluinos) while the\nsleptons remain light. While the masses of the superpartners of the colored objects have\nalready been constrained by current search limits, it is timely to fully explore the discovery\npotential of the LHC for the superpartners of leptons.\nIn the R-parity conserving MSSM with the lightest neutralino \u03c701 being the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (LSP), \u03c701 is a good candidate for Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticle (WIMP) dark matter [10]. When sleptons are light, the t-channel diagram\nmediated by the exchange of sleptons is important in determining the annihilation cross\nsection of \u03c701 dark matter [11]. Therefore, discovery of the sleptons is not only a verification\nof low energy supersymmetry in nature; precise measurement of their masses also plays an\nimportant role in determining the relic density of the neutralino LSP.\nEarlier studies on the slepton discovery potential at the LHC mostly focused on the\nDrell-Yan pair production of slepton pairs, with sleptons directly decaying down to lepton\nand \u03c701 [12\u201314]. Most of those studies are done either in the mSUGRA framework or for a\ncertain set of benchmark points only. The Drell-Yan production cross sections for slepton\npairs are typically small, suppressed both by the electroweak coupling strength, as well as\nthe scalar nature of the sleptons. The LHC reach is very limited: ml\u0303L & 300 GeV and\nml\u0303R & 200 GeV for the LHC with center of mass 14 TeV and 30 fb\u22121 integrated luminosity\n[14].\nIn our study, we focused on an alternative production mechanism for the sleptons via the\non-shell decay of heavier neutralino and chargino states [15]. In particular, we considered\nthe scenario where M1 < ml\u0303L < M2 \u226a \u03bc and studied the pair production of Wino-like\n2\n\n\f\u00b1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 with the subsequent decay of \u03c72 \u2192 ll\u0303L \u2192 ll\u03c71 and \u03c71 \u2192 l\u03bd\u0303, \u03bd l\u0303L \u2192 l\u03bd\u03c71 . The\ncollider signature is trilepton plus missing ET .\nCompared to the traditional searches of slepton Drell-Yan pair production with dilepton\nplus missing ET signature, this channel is advantageous for the following reasons. Firstly,\n0\nthe production cross section for \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 , although also at the electroweak strength, is larger\nthan slepton pair production due to the fermionic nature of the neutralinos and charginos.\nSecondly, for \u03c702 and \u03c7\u00b1\n1 being dominantly Wino, the decay branching fraction into lefthanded sleptons is almost 100%. Thirdly, the SM backgrounds for this trilepton signature\nare also much smaller, with dominant contributions from the leptonic decay of W Z/\u03b3 \u2217, as\nwell as tt\u0304 with an extra lepton from heavy flavor decay.\nIn addition, the invariant mass of the dileptons from the \u03c702 cascade decay chain,\nmll , has a distinctive triangle shape, with a sharp kinematic cutoff, mcut completely\ndetermined by m\u03c702 , m\u03c701 and ml\u0303L [16]. This triangle feature has been mostly used as\na precise determination of the slepton mass [16\u201318]. It is also used in the recent CMS\nopposite sign dilepton searches to enhance the signal acceptance [5]. Although this spectral\nshape can be obvious to the eye, it could easily get washed out when SM backgrounds\nare considered. In our study, we explore the LHC discovery potential for sleptons by\nperforming a fit to this triangle spectral shape. We also fit the dilepton invariant mass\ndistribution from the dominant SM backgrounds (either containing a Z/\u03b3 \u2217 or from tt\u0304).\nSince we keep the overall normalization of the backgrounds that contain a Z as a fitting\nparameter, our treatment allows us to include other backgrounds that contain a Z as well,\nfor example, those from other SUSY processes. We obtain the effective cross section, \u03c3\u00d7\nBR \u00d7 acceptance, necessary for a 5\u03c3 discovery as a function of the cutoff mass. This result\nis model independent and can be applied to any new physics model that gives rise to the\nsame decay topology and signature. When applied to the MSSM slepton produced in the\n0\ncascade decay of Wino-like \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 , we obtain the 5\u03c3 reach in the parameter space of M2 vs.\nml\u0303L .\nA recent analysis by ATLAS on the same sign dilepton plus missing ET signature [2]\n\u00b1\n0\n0\nstudied \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 associated production with decays of \u03c71 and \u03c72 via on-shell slepton in a\nsimplified weak gaugino production model. With 1 fb\u22121 at the 7 TeV LHC, masses of \u03c7\u00b1\n1\n(\u03c702 ) up to 200 GeV for m\u03c701 = 0 GeV were excluded at 95% C.L., based on event counting.\nFitting the dilepton invariant mass distribution was also performed in the opposite sign\ndilepton plus missing ET search at CMS [5]. With 0.98 fb\u22121 integrated luminosity at the\n7 TeV LHC, 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section times acceptance of about 4 \u2212 30\nfb is obtained for the cutoff mass scale between 20 to 300 GeV.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss the slepton production\nand decay, focusing on the sleptons produced via neutralino/chargino cascade decay and\nidentify their collider signature. In Sec. III, we present the triangle spectral shape of the\ndilepton invariant mass distribution and discuss the parameter dependence of the cutoff\nmass. In Sec. IV, we review the current collider bounds on sleptons as well as bounds\non neutralinos and charginos in the MSSM. In Sec. V, we discuss in detail our treatment\nof the signal, as well as the SM backgrounds by fitting to the spectral shape of the mll\ndistribution. In Sec. VI, we present the model-independent least effective cross section,\n\n3\n\n\f\u03c3 \u00d7 BR \u00d7 acceptance, that is needed for a 5\u03c3 discovery as a function of cutoff mass at the\nLHC with center of mass energy 14 TeV and 100 fb\u22121 luminosity. In Sec. VII, we apply our\nstudy in the MSSM electroweak sector and show the 5\u03c3 reach in M2 vs. ml\u0303L parameter\nspace. In Sec. VIII, we conclude.\nII.\n\nMSSM WITH LIGHT GAUGINOS AND SLEPTONS\n\nWe consider the low lying spectrum of the MSSM electroweak sector, which includes\nonly neutralinos, charginos, and light sleptons. In our discussion below, we assume the\ncanonical case where M1 < M2 , \u03bc (M1 , M2 and \u03bc being the mass parameters for Bino,\nWinos and Higgsinos, respectively) and the lightest neutralino LSP is dominantly Binotype. Scenarios with other mass orderings can be studied similarly. The slepton mass\nspectrum is determined by (M2l\u0303 )LL , (M2l\u0303 )RR and (M2l\u0303 )LR , where each M2l\u0303 is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix,\nrepresenting three generations. In our study, we take the simple assumption that the flavor\nmixing between generations is negligible. The phenomenology and implication of sizable\nflavor mixing in the slepton sector can be found in Ref. [19, 20]. Furthermore, the leftright mixing in the slepton sector is typically proportional to the lepton Yukawa, which\nis small for the first two generations. Therefore, we assume there is no left-right mixing\nfor selectrons and smuons and label the mass eigenstates as l\u0303L and l\u0303R , for l = e, \u03bc,\nwith masses ml\u0303L and ml\u0303R , respectively. For the stau, left-right mixing could be sizable,\nespecially with large tan \u03b2. The mass eigenstates are labeled as \u03c4\u03031 and \u03c4\u03032 . There are three\nparameters involved for the stau sector: m\u03c4\u03031 , m\u03c4\u03032 and the left-right mixing angle \u03b8\u03c4\u0303 . Our\ndiscussion below applies to the simplified case of selectrons and smuons, although it could\nbe adapted to the stau case as well. For sneutrinos, their masses m\u03bd\u0303l are also determined\nby (Ml\u0303 )2LL . Therefore, their masses are related to ml\u0303L with a small splitting introduced by\nelectroweak effects: m\u03bd\u03032l = m2l\u0303 + m2W cos 2\u03b2; for the allowed range of tan \u03b2 > 1, m\u03bd\u0303l < ml\u0303L .\nL\n\nThe direct production channels of sleptons are Drell-Yan pair productions of l\u0303L l\u0303L , l\u0303L \u03bd\u0303l ,\n\u03bd\u0303l \u03bd\u0303l and l\u0303R l\u0303R . The production cross sections are typically small due to both the\n\u221a electroweak\ncoupling strength and the scalar nature of the particles. At the LHC with s = 14 TeV,\nthe cross sections vary from 0.2 pb to 0.5 fb for l\u0303L l\u0303L and \u03bd\u0303l \u03bd\u0303l , from 0.8 pb to 1.5 fb for\nl\u0303L \u03bd\u0303l , and from 0.08 pb to 0.2 fb for l\u0303R l\u0303R , for masses of sleptons in the range of 100 to 500\nGeV [13].\nThe decay of right-handed sleptons is quite straightforward, proceeding dominantly into\nl\u03c701 . In cases when on-shell decay of l\u0303R into higher neutralino states is open and when\nthere is a significant Bino component in higher neutralino states (typical for \u03bc \u223c M1 ),\nl\u0303R \u2192 l\u03c702,3,4 could also contribute, although the decay branching fraction is almost always\nsuppressed.\nThe decay of left-handed sleptons depends on the neutralino and chargino spectrum,\nin particular, that of Wino-type neutralino and charginos. Since the decay of sleptons\ninto Higgsino-type neutralinos and charginos are typically suppressed, we assume M2 \u226a \u03bc,\nand thus \u03c702 , \u03c7\u00b1\n1 are mostly Wino-like. For ml\u0303L , m\u03bd\u0303l < M2 , the branching fractions of\n0\nl\u0303L \u2192 l\u03c71 , \u03bd\u0303l \u2192 \u03bdl \u03c701 are almost 100%. Once ml\u0303L , m\u03bd\u0303l & M2 , the decays of l\u0303L \u2192 l\u03c702 , \u03bdl \u03c7\u00b1\n1,\n4\n\n\f0\n\u03bd\u0303l \u2192 \u03bdl \u03c702 , l\u03c7\u00b1\n1 become dominant. The branching fraction is about 10% into \u03c71 , 30% into\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03c702 , and 60% into \u03c71 . With the subsequent decay of \u03c702 \u2192 Z (\u2217) \u03c701 , h\u03c701 and \u03c71 \u2192 W (\u2217) \u03c701 ,\nleft-handed slepton and sneutrino decay would have multi-lepton, multi-jets, plus missing\nET final states.\nFor the Drell-Yan pair production of sleptons with dominant direct decay of sleptons\ninto \u03c701 , the collider signatures are dilepton plus missing ET for l\u0303L l\u0303L and l\u0303R l\u0303R , single lepton\nplus missing ET for l\u0303L \u03bd\u0303l , and missing ET only for \u03bd\u0303L \u03bd\u0303L . The single lepton channel suffers\nfrom large SM backgrounds, mainly W . The missing ET only signature from \u03bd\u0303L \u03bd\u0303L needs an\nextra jet or lepton from initial or final state radiation, which leads to further suppression of\nsignal cross sections. Current collider analyses of slepton Drell-Yan production focus on the\nfinal states of two isolated energetic leptons plus missing ET [13, 14]. The SM backgrounds\nare typically large, dominantly from W W or tt\u0304. The LHC reach is very limited: ml\u0303L & 300\nGeV and ml\u0303R & 200 GeV for the LHC with center of mass 14 TeV and 30 fb\u22121 integrated\nluminosity [14].\nIn this paper, we explore alternative production channels for sleptons, in particular, l\u0303L\nand \u03bd\u0303l , via the decay of heavier neutralinos and charginos. The coupling of Higgsinos\nto sleptons are highly suppressed by the small lepton Yukawa coupling, therefore the\nproduction of sleptons from Higgsino decay is negligible. We assume \u03bc is heavy and\ndecouple Higgsinos. Winos, on the other hand, could dominantly decay into l\u0303L and \u03bd\u0303l\nonce it is kinematically available, since the competing processes of \u03c702 \u2192 Z\u03c701 , h\u03c701 and\n0\n\u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u2192 W \u03c71 suffer from small neutralino mixing. The pair production cross sections of\nWino-like neutralinos/charginos are larger compared to those of sleptons of similar mass.\n0\nIn Fig. 1, we show the production cross section for Wino-like \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 for the LHC with\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV. The cross section is about 10 pb for M2 around 100 GeV, which drops\nto about 10 fb for M2 around 700 GeV. In principle, l\u0303L,R could also appear in Bino-like\nneutralino decay, in cases of M1 > ml\u0303 , M2 , \u03bc. However, the pair productions of Binotype neutralino with other neutralinos/charginos are typically suppressed due to the small\nneutralino mixing effects.\nFor M1 < ml\u0303L , m\u03bd\u0303l < M2 , the lightest chargino \u03c7\u00b1\n1 dominantly decays into l\u03bd\u0303l and\n\u03bdl l\u0303L . With the consequent decay of \u03bd\u0303l and l\u0303L directly into \u03c701 , the branching fraction\n0\n0\nof \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u2192 l\u03bdl \u03c71 is almost 100%. \u03c72 , on the other hand, decays into \u03bdl \u03bd\u0303l and ll\u0303L with\nabout the same branching fraction. The former decay leads to \u03bd\u03bd\u03c701 final states, while the\nlatter process has two isolated charged leptons ll\u03c701 . Considering trilepton plus missing\n0\nET signatures, the overall branching fraction of \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 into this final state is about 50%.\n0\nCombining the production cross section of \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 , left-handed sleptons could be produced in\nthe decay products of Wino-like heavier neutralino and charginos states with relatively large\ncross sections compared to the direct Drell-Yan process. Relatively small SM background\nfor the trilepton final state and the distinctive triangle spectral shape for mll render this\nchannel useful in probing the left-handed sleptons at the LHC. Of course it should always\nbe kept in mind that such slepton production is only possible when the slepton masses are\nless than M2 .\nIt should also be noted that such slepton production via cascade decay of heavier\nneutralinos and charginos only works effectively for the left-handed charged sleptons.

Here we have decoupled both Higgsinos as well as\nsquarks. The right plot shows the Feynman diagram that gives rise to the trilepton plus missing\nET final states.\n\nthe right handed sleptons, even if it is lighter than M2 , the branching fraction is small in\ngeneral compared to the dominant decays of \u03c702 \u2192 Z\u03c701 , \u03c702 \u2192 h\u03c701 since it is suppressed by\nthe small Wino-Bino mixing. It only becomes important in the limited parameter regions\nwith small M2 \u2212 M1 such that the on-shell decay of \u03c702 into the dominant channels are\nforbidden. Therefore, in our study below, we focus on the light left-handed sleptons.\nIn cases when \u03bc is lighter: M1 < \u03bc < M2 , additional decay modes of heavier Wino\nstates into lighter Higgsino states plus Higgses open, which could lead to the suppression\nof the branching fractions of Winos decaying into sleptons. The results that we obtained in\nour study, however, can also be applied to such cases, taking into account the suppressed\nbranching fractions.\nIII.\n\nmll DISTRIBUTION AND TRIANGLE SHAPE\n\nOne distinctive feature of the dileptons from the on-shell cascade decay of \u03c702 (see the\nright plot of Fig. 1) is that the invariant dilepton mass mll distribution has a triangle shape\n[16], with a cutoff mass determined by the masses of the \u03c701,2 and l\u0303:\n\nmcut\n\nv\nv\nu\nu\n2\nm2\u03c70\nu\nml\u0303 u\n= m\u03c702 t1 \u2212 2 t1 \u2212 21 .\nm\u03c70\nml\u0303\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\nFig. 2 shows the dependence of mcut on ml\u0303 for a given set of (M1 , M2 ). mcut varies in the\nrange of 0 to M2 \u2212 M1 . For M2 \u2212 M1 > mZ , mcut is larger than mZ (indicated by the\nstraight red dotted line in Fig. 2) for a large range of ml\u0303 . This is advantageous since we\n6\n\n\f400\n350\n\n(M1,M2)=(50,400)GeV\nBenchmark II\n\nmcut (GeV)\n\n300\n250\n200\n\n(M1,M2)=(50,225)GeV\n\n150\n100\n\nmZ\n\nBenchmark I\n\n50\n0\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n250\nmslepton (GeV)\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nFIG. 2: The dependence of the dilepton invariant mass mll distribution endpoint mcut on the\nslepton mass ml\u0303 , for (M1 , M2 )=(50,400) GeV (solid curve) and (50,225) GeV (dashed curve).\nBenchmark point I: (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 225, 200) GeV and benchmark point II: (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) =\n(50, 400, 220) GeV are displayed as dots. Also plotted is the Z boson mass in red dotted line.\n\ncan effectively suppress the dominant SM background from W Z/\u03b3 \u2217 by imposing a mll cut\nto be above mZ .\nThis feature in the mll spectral shape is often used as a precise determination of the\nslepton mass [16]. Even in the case of off-shell sleptons in neutralino decay, there have been\nstudies in the literature exploring the sensitivity of the mll spectral shape on the slepton\nmass [17, 18]. In our study below, we explore how to use this distinctive triangle shape of\nthe mll distribution to identify the slepton signal from the SM backgrounds. This triangle\nshape in mll is not unique to the specified \u03c702 decay in the MSSM; it could appear in many\nnew physics model with a similar cascade decay topology that gives rise to two leptons.\nOur analysis is therefore model independent and can be applied to a more general set of\nnew physics models.\nIV.\n\nCURRENT COLLIDER SEARCH LIMITS\n\nThe current best limits on the slepton\nmasses come from LEP searches for dilepton plus\n\u221a\nmissing energy signatures [21] with s up to 208 GeV. For a mass splitting between slepton\nand neutralino LSP above 15 GeV and considering only the contribution from right-handed\nsleptons, the mass limits are: m\u1ebd > 99.6 GeV, m\u03bc\u0303 > 94.9 GeV and m\u03c4\u0303 > 85.9 GeV. This\nis conservative, since the production cross section for the left-handed sleptons is higher.\nFor stau, it is possible have a large left-right mixing, which could decrease the production\ncross section for the lightest stau pair. A lower limit of m\u03c4\u0303 > 85.0 GeV can be obtained\nwhen the production cross section for the lightest stau is minimized. It should be noted\nthat the slepton mass limits are obtained with \u03bc = \u2212200 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 1.5, a point at\n7\n\n\fwhich the neutralino mass limit based on the LEP neutralino and chargino searches is the\nweakest, and the selectron cross section is relatively small. The gaugino mass unification\nrelation M1 = (5/3) tan2 \u03b8W M2 is assumed, which is relevant in fixing the masses and field\ncontent of the neutralinos. Slepton mass limits would change for a non-unified mass relation\nbetween M1 and M2 , since neutralinos appear in both the slepton decay final states, as\nwell as participating in the t-channel diagram for selectron production. For selectrons,\n\u1ebdL \u1ebdR production is also possible via t-channel neutralino exchange. In the case where the\n\u1ebdR \u2212 \u03c701 mass splitting is small and the usual acoplanar dilepton search is insensitive, a\nsingle lepton plus missing energy search yields a lower limit on m\u1ebdR of 73 GeV, independent\nof m\u03c701 [22]. For sneutrinos, a mass limit of 45 GeV can be deduced from the invisible Z\ndecay width [23]. An indirect mass limit on sneutrinos could be derived from the direct\nsearch limits on the charged slepton masses.\nSince we consider the production of sleptons from heavier neutralino decay, we also\nsummarize the current status of the neutralino and chargino sector. Charginos \u03c7\u00b1\n1 can be\npair produced at LEP via s-channel exchange of Z/\u03b3 \u2217 or t-channel exchange of \u03bd\u0303e , with\ndestructive interference. It decays to f f \u0304\u2032\u03c701 via a virtual W or sfermion, or dominantly to\nf f \u0303\u2032 when two body decay is kinematically accessible. In the case of heavy sfermions and\na mass splitting m\u03c7\u00b11 \u2212 m\u03c701 of at least a few GeV, a robust chargino mass lower limit of\n103.5 GeV can be obtained for sneutrino masses larger than 300 GeV [24], assuming the\ngaugino mass unification relation. For the case of small mass splitting between the lightest\nchargino and neutralino LSP, limits have been obtained for the degenerate gaugino region\n(M1 \u223c M2 ): m\u03c7\u00b11 > 91.9 GeV for large sneutrino mass, as well as the \"deep Higgsino\"\nregion (|\u03bc| \u226a M1,2 ): m\u03c7\u00b11 > 92.4 GeV [25]. For lower sfermion masses, the limit is worse\ndue to the reduced pair production cross section, as well as the reduction of selection\nefficiency due to the opening of two body decay channels. In particular, there is a so called\n\"corridor\" region where m\u03c7\u00b11 \u2212 m\u03bd\u0303l is small and the lepton from \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u2192 l\u03bd\u0303l is so soft that\n0 0\nit can escape detection. Associated production of \u03c71 \u03c72 can be studied in cases where the\nchargino search becomes ineffective. Limits on chargino and neutralino masses for the light\nsfermion case, therefore, depend on the sfermion spectrum.\nFor the lightest neutralino LSP, there is no general mass limit from LEP if the gaugino\nmass unification relation is not imposed. Production via s-channel exchange of Z/\u03b3 \u2217 could\nbe absent for a Bino-like neutralino, and t-channel production could be negligible for heavy\nselectrons. An indirect mass limit on the neutralino LSP can be derived from chargino,\nslepton and Higgs boson searches, when gaugino mass (and sfermion mass) unification\nrelation is assumed. A lower mass limit of 47 GeV can be obtained at large tan \u03b2 [26],\nwhile a tighter limit of 50 GeV can be derived in the mSUGRA scenario [27].\n0\nTrilepton searches at Tevatron Run II [28, 29] study the associated production of \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 0\n0\n0\n+ \u2212 0\nwith the subsequent decay of \u03c71 \u2192 l\u03bd\u03c71 and \u03c72 \u2192 l l \u03c71 . \u03c3 \u00d7 BR(\u03c71 \u03c72 \u2192 3l) is\nbounded to be less than about 0.13 \u2212 0.06 pb (0.5 \u2212 0.1 pb) from D\u00d8 (CDF) searches for\nchargino mass in the range of 100 \u2212 180 GeV. For sufficient light sleptons, the leptonic\ndecay branching fractions are large and a mass limit on the lightest chargino can be derived\nbased on the null search results. A chargino mass limit of 138 GeV is obtained based on\nD\u00d8 searches, when the leptonic branching fraction for three body decay is maximized,\n8\n\n\fwhile no mass limit can be derived in the large m0 case [29]. A recent CDF analysis with\n5.8 fb\u22121 data gives a mass limit on the chargino to be 168 GeV at 95% C.L., for the\nmSUGRA benchmark point m0 = 60 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 3 and A0 = 0 [28].\nLimits on \u03c3\u00d7BR(\u2265 3l) are also obtained based on the recent\n\u221a trilepton search from CMS\ncollaboration using 2.1 fb\u22121 data collected at the LHC with s = 7 TeV [4]. No jet veto\nis imposed and the dominant contribution to the trilepton signal is from gluino cascade\ndecay. No limit on the chargino mass can be derived based on the direct pair production\n0\nof \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 .\n0\nRecent analyses by ATLAS on the same sign dilepton plus missing ET [2] studied \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72\n\u00b1\n0\nassociated production with the consequent decay of \u03c71 and \u03c72 via an on-shell slepton.\n0\nAssuming ml\u0303 = 12 (m\u03c701 + m\u03c7\u00b11 ), m\u03c7\u00b11 = m\u03c702 , masses of \u03c7\u00b1\n1 (\u03c72 ) up to 200 GeV for m\u03c701 = 0\nGeV are excluded at 95% C.L with 1 fb\u22121 data collected at the 7 TeV LHC. For m\u03c701 about\n50 GeV, the limit on m\u03c7\u00b11 , m\u03c702 is weakened to be about 150 GeV.\nCMS performed an analysis on the opposite sign dilepton plus missing ET final states\nby looking for the kinematic edge in the dilepton invariant mass distribution [5]. With 0.98\nfb\u22121 integrated luminosity at the 7 TeV LHC, 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section\ntimes acceptance of about 4 \u2212 30 fb are obtained for the cutoff mass scale between 20\nto 300 GeV, assuming the signal efficiency of the LM1 benchmark point: m0 = 60 GeV,\nm1/2 = 250 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0 and \u03bc > 0.\nV.\n\nMETHOD\n\nThe dominant standard model backgrounds for the trilepton plus missing ET signal are\nW Z/\u03b3 \u2217 and tt\u0304 with a fake lepton (dominantly from b decay). Note that trileptons from\nheavy flavor bottom and charm decay (produced in association with Z/\u03b3 \u2217 ) could also be a\nsignificant background [30]. As explained below, the overall normalization of backgrounds\nwith a Z peak is a fitting parameter in our analysis; backgrounds containing heavy flavor\nproduced in association with Z/\u03b3 \u2217 could be included as well. Therefore, we don't simulate\nsuch heavy flavor backgrounds in our analyses.\n0\n0\n0 (\u2217)\nMany SUSY models can generate a trilepton signal, for example, \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 with \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c71 Z\n\u00b1\n0\n(\u2217)\nand \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c71 W . For large mass splitting of m\u03c702 \u2212 m\u03c701 > mZ , the dilepton invariant\nmass distribution from an on-shell Z looks like that of Standard Model W Z. Such SUSY\nbackgrounds, if they exist, are included in our fitting to mll from the Z pole, since the\noverall normalization of the Z contribution is a fitting parameter. For small mass splittings\nm\u03c702 \u2212 m\u03c701 < mZ , mll is peaked near m\u03c702 \u2212 m\u03c701 . For such a case, a dedicated analysis to\ndistinguish such off-shell Z contributions from the triangle spectral shape is necessary.\nThe first difficulty in reconstructing the trilepton event is the combinatorial ambiguity\narising from the presence of a third lepton in the final state. To resolve this issue we use the\nstandard technique of same-sign subtraction. We construct our invariant mass histograms\nby including both of the opposite-sign pairs of leptons and then subtract the histogram\nof same-sign dilepton invariant mass to have a good approximation to the histogram\nof invariant masses of the correct pair of opposite-sign leptons, which is otherwise not\nexperimentally accessible. While other techniques exist to resolve this ambiguity [31], they\n9\n\n\fall sacrifice statistics for purity, and as our intent is to find the general shape, the statistics\nwill generally be of more value for us than the purity.\nWe model the dilepton invariant mass distribution by:\nd\u03c3\n= (ftriangle \u2217 g) + fZ + a0 ftt\u0304 .\ndmll\nThe first term models the triangle shape of the mll from the signal process:\n\u001a\n2Nsig mm2ll\n0 < mll < mcut\ncut\nftriangle (mll ) =\n,\n0\notherwise\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Nsig and mcut are fit parameters for the number of counts in the triangle and the\nmass of the cutoff. To take into account the detector effects, we smear the triangle by a\nconvolution of the triangle function with a gaussian with variance \u03c3 2 shown below:\nZ \u221e\nt2\n1\n\u221a\ndt e\u2212 2\u03c32 ftriangle (mll \u2212 t).\n(ftriangle \u2217 g) \u2261\n(4)\n2\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212\u221e\nThe second term models the contribution to mll from processes that involves a Z peak\nusing the Breit-Wigner function:\nfZ (mll ) =\n\n\u0393\nA\n,\n2\u03c0 (mll \u2212 m0 )2 + (\u0393/2)2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A, m0 , \u0393 are fit parameters for the amplitude, centroid, and width of the Z pole.\nNote that we fit the centroid and the width of the Z pole instead of using the SM values\nto account for the smearing effects introduced by the detector resolution.\nThe last term models the contribution to mll from tt\u0304 trilepton events, where ftt\u0304 is the\nmll distribution from tt\u0304 dilepton events taken from Monte Carlo, scaled by a factor a0 , a\nparameter to represent the fake rate of tt\u0304 to give three leptons. This is intended to emulate\na data-driven background understanding, where the dilepton mass distribution is measured\nin a control region and then used to understand the background in the signal region. We\nchoose the dilepton distribution because we expect that the two \"wrong\" pairs will largely\ncancel each other out in the subtracted distribution.\nThus, we have in total seven fitting parameters:\n\u2022 Number of events in triangle: Nsig\n\u2022 Cutoff in triangle distribution: mcut\n\u2022 Amount of gaussian smearing of the triangle: \u03c3\n\u2022 Amplitude of Z peak: A\n\u2022 Apparent width of Z peak: \u0393\n10\n\n\f\u2022 Apparent centroid of Z peak: m0\n\u2022 Fake rate for tt\u0304 events: a0\nWe use Madgraph 5 version v0.6.2 [32] and Madevent v4.4.57 [33] to generate our signal\nand background events. These events are passed to Pythia v6.4 [34] to simulate initial state\nradiation, final state radiation, showering and hadronization. Additionally we use PGS4\n[35] with the ATLAS detector card to simulate detector effects. Note that, in producing\nand fitting the dilepton invariant mass, we require only that there be three leptons in the\nevent. In particular, there is no requirement of low hadronic activity, which means that\nstrong production of particles which later decay through an on-shell slepton can also be\nmeasured using this technique. We also do not require any missing energy, which allows\nthis technique to be applicable in scenarios which do not include an invisible final state\nparticle, such as R-parity violating theories. In general, some minimal requirement will be\nneeded to ensure that events can be triggered on (either through a single lepton trigger or\ndilepton trigger), but all of the points we consider have spectra which are not compressed\nenough to have significant loss due to triggering efficiencies.\nFor signal generation, we considered the simplified case where the lightest neutralino is\npurely Bino in nature, and the second neutralino is purely Wino, with degenerate charginos\nwhich are also purely Wino: m\u03c701 = M1 and m\u03c7\u00b11 = m\u03c702 = M2 . This corresponds to taking\nthe Higgsino mass parameter \u03bc to be heavy such that the Higgsinos decouple. We assume\nthere is no left-right mixing, as well as no flavor mixing between slepton generations. We\nalso completely decouple the heavy colored objects. The relevant mass parameters involved\nare M1 , M2 and ml\u0303L .\n\u00b1\n0\nWe simulate the associated production of \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 with the consequent decay of \u03c71 and\n\u03c702 via left-handed sleptons, as shown in Fig. 1. As discussed earlier in Sec. II, since \u03c702\nhas equal probability to decay into l\u0303L or \u03bd\u0303l , we obtain trilepton final states lll+ 6ET\n50% of the time. For simplicity, we only consider trilepton events with l being either\nan electron or muon. In cases with lepton universality, m\u1ebdL = m\u03bc\u0303L = m\u03c4\u0303L , we could\nstudy the same flavor, opposite sign mll distribution. For non-degenerate slepton masses\nbetween generations, multiple triangle shapes appear and the analysis is more complicated,\nthough with no flavor mixing they appear in different channels. Note that in the realistic\ncase when the neutralino and chargino mass eigenstates are not the pure gauginos, the\ncorresponding branching fractions for the decay into l\u0303L and \u03bd\u0303l need to be considered. For\nthe backgrounds, we generate the SM W Z/\u03b3 \u2217 trilepton events, as well as tt\u0304 with both tops\ndecaying leptonically.\nWe construct our signal and background histograms of the dilepton invariant mass by\nusing our Monte Carlo data as probability distributions from which we select events. For\nthe signal, we draw from the opposite-sign lepton events 2Nsig times and draw from the\nsame-sign lepton events Nsig times and construct the difference between the opposite-sign\nand same-sign distributions. Nsig is the number of events that we are including in the\npseudoexperiment we are currently generating. For a given luminosity, Nsig = L \u00d7 \u03c3sig \u00d7\nBR \u00d7 acceptance. Similarly, we can draw NW Z/\u03b3 \u2217 events from the SM W Z/\u03b3 \u2217 background\nand construct the corresponding mll distribution.\n11\n\n\fd\u03c3\ndMLL\n\nd\u03c3\ndMLL\n\n2000\n\n500\n\n400\n1500\n300\n1000\n200\n500\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180 200\nMLL [GeV]\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n400\nMLL [GeV]\n\nFIG. 3: mll distribution for MSSM trilepton signal and dominant SM backgrounds at the 14 TeV\nLHC with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 . The relevant MSSM parameters are chosen to\nbe benchmark point I: (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 225, 200) GeV with mcut =100 GeV (left plot), and\nbenchmark point II: (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 400, 220) GeV with mcut =325 GeV (right plot). Also\nshown as black curves are the best fit distribution using Eq. (2).\n\nPurely leptonic tt\u0304 decay could lead to trilepton events with a third faked lepton from\nb decay. In the pseudoexperiment we are currently generating, we estimate the expected\ntrilepton events Ntt\u0304 using the fake rate estimated from PGS simulation: Ntt\u0304 = L \u00d7 \u03c3tt\u0304 \u00d7\nBR \u00d7 fake rate \u00d7 acceptance, where the fake rate is about 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22123.\nIn a trilepton tt\u0304 sample, the opposite sign dilepton mll distribution originating from\nW + W \u2212 decay is the same as the dilepton distribution from dilepton tt\u0304 events. While\nopposite-sign/same-sign dilepton mll distributions with one lepton from W and the other\nfrom near/far b jets have a very different distribution in principle, due to poor MonteCarlo statistics on the three lepton tt\u0304 events, we draw from the opposite-sign dilepton\ndistribution of the dilepton tt\u0304 event samples Ntt\u0304 times to simulate the expected final\ndistribution of mll from W pair decay. We take the simplified assumption that the same\nsign and opposite sign mll distributions from the W b combination are very similar and\nbuild two random histograms from the same-sign dilepton distribution of the trilepton tt\u0304\nsample with Ntt\u0304 entries each to simulate the wrong pair of opposite-sign leptons and the\nsame-sign pair of leptons, respectively. We then combine these histograms appropriately\nto get our pseudoexperiment result histogram for the tt\u0304 background. While this is not\na perfect description of the background in question due to physical differences between\nthe distributions of the incorrect pair of opposite-sign leptons and the pair of same-sign\nleptons, it is approximately valid and a more accurate data-driven background method\nthan the one we use will be able to include those differences without great difficulty, so the\nsensitivities we find using this technique should be valid.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the mll distribution for the MSSM trilepton signal and dominant SM\nbackgrounds at the 14 TeV LHC with integrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 , for two benchmark\npoints: I, (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 225, 200) GeV (left plot); II, (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 400, 220)\n12\n\n\fA\nBenchmark\nPoint I\nBenchmark\nPoint II\n\ninput\nfitted\ninput\nfitted\n\n3.981 \u00d7 103\n3.299 \u00d7 103\n3.981 \u00d7 103\n3.347 \u00d7 103\n\n\u0393\n(GeV)\n3.121\n(3.121)\n3.121\n2.914\n\nm0\na0\n(GeV) (\u00d710\u22123 )\n90.158 4.280\n(90.158) 5.420\n90.158 4.280\n90.041 4.412\n\nmcut\n(GeV)\n99.8\n99.5\n325.3\n321.9\n\nNsig\n\n\u03c3 \u03c72 /dof\n(GeV)\n\n1.85 \u00d7 104\n1.83 \u00d7 104 0.980\n3.17 \u00d7 103\n3.14 \u00d7 103 2.319\n\n1.54\n0.94\n\nTABLE I: Input and final fitting parameters to Eq. (2) for two benchmark points: I,\n(M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 225, 200) GeV; II, (M1 , M2 , ml\u0303L ) = (50, 400, 220) GeV, for the 14 TeV\nLHC with L = 100 fb\u22121 . The cutoff for benchmark I is less than 150 GeV so we fix the width\nand centroid of the Z peak with the values obtained from the mll distribution of the SM W Z/\u03b3 \u2217\nbackgrounds based on Monte-Carlo simulation.\n\nGeV (right plot). The corresponding triangle cutoff masses are 100 GeV and 325 GeV,\nrespectively. For mcut near mZ (as in Benchmark Point I), the triangle distribution of mll\nfrom the signal process is buried under the SM Z pole, making the identification of such\ntriangle features much more difficult. For mcut far above mZ (as in Benchmark Point II),\nthe sharp cutoff feature in mll distribution can be easily identified from the SM background,\nas shown in the right plot of Fig. 3.\nFor a given value of integrated luminosity, we fit the mll distributions built from the\nsignal and background events generated as described above, using formulae given in Eqs. (2)\n\u2212 (5) with seven fitting parameters. When the cutoff falls near the Z pole, we find\nthat the fitting routine has too much freedom and often fails to identify the cutoff in the\nproper location. This failure is due to the similarity of the sharp feature of the cutoff and\nthe edge of the Z pole. This results in a large degeneracy in the signal and Z pole fit\nparameters. Therefore, we fix the Z width, \u0393 to be 3.121 GeV and centroid position, m0\nto be 90.158 GeV when the cutoff is less than 150 GeV. These values are obtained from\nthe mll distribution of the SM W Z/\u03b3 \u2217 backgrounds for events passed through the PGS\ndetector simulation.\nWe perform a \u03c72 fit using the MINUIT fitting routine [36]. We fit from 20 GeV to\n(mcut +100 GeV), with a fixed binning scheme of 3 GeV/bin. We find a good fit to the\ndata with \u03c72 /dof \u223c 1 for all cutoff masses. For high cutoff masses, \u03c72 /dof is slightly lower\ndue to the fact that our fit spans more bins. Conversely, we find a slightly higher \u03c72 /dof\nat lower cutoff mass. The data driven approach to fitting the background works very well\nproviding a best fit \u03c72 /dof of about 1 when fitting only the background. For high cutoff\nmasses, we also consider fits from 125 GeV to (mcut +100 GeV). This to ensure that our\nfits for the cutoff at high mass are not being influenced too greatly by fitting the Z at low\nmass. As an illustration, we show in Table I the input parameters for the simulation, as\nwell as the fitting parameters for the two benchmark points.\n\n13\n\n\fFIG. 4: Effective trilepton cross section, \u03c3 \u00d7 BR \u00d7 acceptance, at the 14 TeV LHC required for\na 5\u03c3 detection of the cutoff feature with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 . For the left plot,\nthe cross section reach is obtained with a fitting for mll in the range of 20 GeV to (mcut +100\nGeV). For the right plot, a fitting range of 125 GeV to (mcut +100 GeV) is used.\nVI.\n\nRESULTS\n\nUsing the fitting strategy described above and assuming only the SM backgrounds for\ntrilepton plus missing ET signals, for a given cutoff mass mcut , we fit for the cutoff feature,\nmarginalizing over the other fit parameters. This allows us to determine the number of\nevents required for a detection of the cutoff feature with 5\u03c3-level confidence. We consider\ncutoff masses ranging from 75 to 650 GeV stepping by 25 GeV, with finer stepping around\nthe Z pole. As explained before, for cutoff masses below 150 GeV, we perform a fiveparameter fitting with the Z width and centroid fixed. For cutoff masses above 150 GeV,\nwe perform a seven-parameter fitting, allowing the fitting parameters of the Z pole to vary\nfreely.\nIn the left plot of Fig. 4 we plot the required effective trilepton cross section, \u03c3 \u00d7 BR \u00d7\nacceptance, as a function of cutoff mass for 5\u03c3 discovery at the 14 TeV LHC with an\nintegrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 . The maximum near 100 GeV is due to the difficulty of\ndetecting the cutoff feature near the Z pole. There is a significant parameter degeneracy\nbetween the amplitude of the Z and the number of counts in the triangle. The effect also\ncreates a significant scatter amongst the data points. At cutoff masses greater than 150\nGeV, the required cross section for detection decreases with increasing cutoff mass. The\nscatter at high cutoff mass is due to statistical fluctuations in the Monte Carlo during the\nfitting process. The quality of the fit, however, depends on the range of mll that is used\nin the fitting.\n14\n\n\fIn the right plot of Fig. 4, we show the 5\u03c3 reach in the effective cross section similar\nto the left plot, but only fitting the mll distribution above 125 GeV rather than above\n20 GeV, such that the background contributions are significantly less relevant to the fit.\nComparing to the left plot, in which a blind fitting is performed without prior knowledge\nof possible range of mcut , although the resulting lower limit on the effective cross section\nis very similar in both cases, the fit with mll > 125 GeV above the Z pole is more robust\nsince it greatly reduces the dependence on the precise knowledge of the backgrounds, in\nparticular, those containing a Z pole.\nNote that the above result is obtained for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 . There is\nno simple scaling behavior of the required effective cross section for a different luminosity\nbecause this fitting technique does not have the simple statistical behavior of a counting\nexperiment. In order to understand the sensitivity of this technique at significantly different\nluminosities it is necessary to generate a new set of pseudoexperiments and analyze them\nas explained above.\nVII.\n\nSLEPTON REACH IN MSSM\n\nThe most straightforward application of this search is to a system which gives the\nmaximal branching ratio for the slepton decay of the second neutralino. We therefore\nconsider the simplified MSSM scenario that is described earlier, in which \u03c701 is purely Bino\n0\nand \u03c7\u00b1\n1 , \u03c72 are purely Winos with no left-right mixing in the slepton sector and squarks\ndecoupled. Note that in this simplified scenario, such a trilepton search channel is only\nsensitive to the intermediate l\u0303L since decays to l\u0303R are forbidden due to the absence of\ncouplings.\n0\nWino pair production \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 is completely controlled by gauge couplings in this\napproximation, which allows us to make robust predictions for the cross section of this\nprocess. With our fitting strategy, for a given mass parameter set with known production\ncross section, we allow the luminosity to shift until the triangle spectral shape in mll\ndistribution is detectable at the 5\u03c3 level, as defined above. The previous limits from LEP\nII constrain the left-handed sleptons to be heavier than about 100 GeV, and so we consider\nonly sleptons which are 100 GeV or heavier. While charginos are more weakly constrained\nin general than the left-handed slepton, they must be heavier than the left-handed slepton\nin order to be within this framework. We scan ml\u0303L and M2 in the range of 100 \u2212 700 GeV,\nwith a step size of 25 GeV. The luminosities necessary to discover the slepton in these\ndecays as a function of the masses are shown in Fig. 5.\nIn the left plot of Fig. 5, we assume that only one lepton flavor (selectron in our analysis)\nis accessible in the cascade decay of \u03c702 . For the 14 TeV LHC with 100 fb\u22121 luminosity,\nthe mass reach for the l\u0303L can be reached up to 600 GeV at 5\u03c3 level. In the right plot,\nwe assume the lepton universality condition such that m\u1ebdL = m\u03bc\u0303L = m\u03c4\u0303L . Considering\nonly trilepton events with electrons and muons, namely eee, \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc, e+ e\u2212 \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 e\u00b1 ;\nadditional branching ratio suppression factors need to be applied. The reach for the lefthanded slepton mass is reduced in this case, about 500 GeV for ml\u0303L .\nFor comparison, Drell-Yan slepton searches were considered in Ref. [14], with the authors\n15\n\n\f-1\n\n-1\n\n600\n\nLuminosity [fb ]\nSlepton Mass [GeV]\n\nSlepton Mass [GeV]\n\nLuminosity [fb ]\n\n103\n\n500\n102\n400\n\n600\n\n103\n\n500\n102\n400\n\n10\n\n10\n\n300\n\n300\n1\n\n200\n100\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n700\nWino Mass [GeV]\n\n1\n\n200\n\n10-1\n\n100\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n700\nWino Mass [GeV]\n\n10-1\n\nFIG. 5: Luminosity required at the 14 TeV LHC for a 5\u03c3 detection of the cutoff feature above\nthe SM backgrounds. In the left plot, we assume only the left-handed selectron is accessible in\nthe cascade decay of \u03c702 . In the right plot, we assume that all slepton masses are degenerate. The\ncross section reaches are obtained considering the final states with electrons and muons only.\n\nconcluding that flavor-diagonal sleptons with masses less than 350 \u2212 400 GeV can be\ndiscovered by CMS using 100 fb\u22121 of data. Thus, our technique indicates that, in the\npure gaugino limit, the reach for left-handed sleptons will be significantly enhanced by\nlooking for the characteristic cutoff shape of mll in the decays of the gauginos. Note that\nright-handed sleptons are not subject to these results because they are a singlet under\nSU(2)L .\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this work, we have studied the LHC discovery potential for sleptons, which are\nproduced via the on-shell decay of the heavier neutralino and chargino states. In particular,\n\u00b1\n0\n0\nwe have studied the \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 associated production, with the consequent decays of \u03c71 \u2192 \u03bdl l\u03c71\nand \u03c702 \u2192 ll\u03c701 via on-shell sleptons. Comparing to the conventional slepton searches\nthrough Drell-Yan production and dilepton plus missing ET final states, this trilepton\nplus missing ET channel has the advantage of larger production cross sections and less\nSM backgrounds. In addition, the invariant mass distribution of the dilepton pair from\n\u03c702 decay has a distinctive triangle shape, which can be utilized to select out the signals\nfrom the dominant SM background of W Z/\u03b3 \u2217 and tt\u0304 fakes. We performed a fit to the mll\ndistribution of both the signal and the backgrounds. For the LHC with 14 TeV center\nof mass energy and 100 fb\u22121 integrated luminosity, we obtained the model-independent\nlower bounds on the effective signal cross section, \u03c3 \u00d7 BR \u00d7 acceptance, as a function of\ntriangle cutoff mass, mcut , at 5\u03c3 significance level. Applying this result to the MSSM in\nthe parameter space of M1 < ml\u0303L < M2 \u226a \u03bc, we found that the mass reach for the l\u0303L\ncan be up to 600 GeV at 5\u03c3 level at the 14 TeV LHC with L =100 fb\u22121 , when there is\nonly one slepton generation (selectron in our study) lighter than Winos. For a degenerate\n16\n\n\fslepton spectrum with m\u1ebdL = m\u03bc\u0303L = m\u03c4\u0303L , and considering final states with electrons and\nmuons only, the reach is slightly worse due to the suppression of the branching fractions.\nComparing to earlier studies on the LHC reach for sleptons from Drell-Yan production,\nthe reach for left-handed sleptons via Wino decay is greatly enhanced. On the other\nhand, it should be noted that our study works most effectively for the left-handed slepton,\nsince the decay fraction of heavier neutralino/chargino states to right-handed sleptons is\ntypically suppressed in most of parameter space, either by the small Bino-Wino/Higgsino\nmixing, or the lepton Yukawa couplings. The right-handed slepton could appear in Binolike neutralino decay, if it is not the LSP. The associated production cross sections for Bino\nwith other neutralino/chargino states, however, are suppressed in general. Our study does\nnot apply to the parameter region of ml\u0303L > M2 since the on-shell decay of Winos into\nleft-handed sleptons is forbidden by kinematics. Therefore, for left-handed sleptons with\nmass heavier than M2 or for right-handed sleptons, the usual Drell-Yan production is still\nthe dominant production mode.\nIt should also be emphasized that the results we obtained for the lower bounds on the\neffective signal cross section, \u03c3 \u00d7 BR \u00d7 acceptance, as a function of triangle cutoff mass\nscale mcut is model independent since it can be applied to other new physics models that\ngive rise to the same cascade decay topology and final states of trilepton plus missing ET .\nFor new physics models with a given parameter set, we can obtain mcut as well as the\nproduction cross sections, branching fractions into the trilepton final states, and signal\nacceptance via detector simulation. Comparing it with the lower bounds we obtained, we\ncan derive the LHC reach in the parameter space for such new physics models.\nMore work is needed to fully explore the LHC reach for the slepton sector. Our results\non the left-handed slepton reach are obtained under the simple assumption that \u03c701 is a pure\nBino state, \u03c702 , \u03c7\u00b1\n1 are pure Wino states, and the heavier Higgsino states are completely\ndecoupled. In addition, we studied only final states including electrons and muons. The\nanalysis strategy in our study can be applied to the general MSSM framework with the\nmixing of gaugino and Higgsino states, as well as three lepton flavors (and possible leftright mixing in the stau case). The corresponding branching fraction into trilepton final\nstates needs to be taken into account in such general cases. Trilepton final states with\nall possible flavor combinations could also be studied, although the fitting to the triangle\nshapes might be more complicated when the slepton masses are not degenerate.\nIn our study, we performed the triangle shape fitting to the trilepton plus missing ET\nfinal states. The triangle shape in mll distribution arises from the \u03c702 cascade decay chain.\nTherefore, it appears in any process that contains such a heavy neutralino cascade decay.\nThe fitting strategy could be applied to final states containing two opposite sign same\n0\nflavor dileptons. For example, charginos in \u03c7\u00b1\n1 \u03c72 production could decay to jets instead\nof leptons; or we could consider productions originated from gluinos or squarks, with the\ncascade decay of gluino or quark containing a \u03c702 . SM backgrounds for dilepton plus jets\nplus missing ET signature, of course, are very different from the trilepton plus missing ET\nsignal that we considered in our study.\n\u2212\n\u00b1\n0\nWe could also consider Wino type \u03c7+\n1 \u03c71 production with \u03c71 \u2192 \u03bdl l\u03c71 . The final state\nof dilepton plus missing ET is similar to the conventional slepton study of Drell-Yan pair\n\n17\n\n\fproduction of l\u0303L l\u0303L with l\u0303L \u2192 l\u03c701 . Although this channel is not as powerful as the trilepton\nplus missing ET study that we explored in this paper, it would still have better reach\ncomparing to the Drell-Yan process given the larger production cross sections.\nAs we mentioned earlier, our analyses can not be applied to the cases when the sleptons\nare heavier than M2 , when the Drell-Yan is the dominant production mode. Previous LHC\nanalyses on the Drell-Yan channel focused on the dilepton plus missing ET final states.\nWhen left-handed sleptons are heavier than Wino-like neutralino/charginos, the branching\nfractions of heavier sleptons into Wino-like states are sizable given its SU(2) coupling\nstrength. Considering the consequent decay of the Wino-like neutralino/charginos, multiple\nleptons (up to six) + jets + missing ET final states could appear, which provides additional\nchannels for the left-handed slepton discovery at the LHC. For the right-handed sleptons,\nhowever, decays into lepton plus Bino-like \u03c701 LSP are still dominant.\nLight sleptons could also contribute sizably to low energy processes, for example, parityviolating electron scattering, leptonic Pion and Kaon decays, etc. [37]. Given the recent\nprogress on both the theoretical and experimental studies in those low energy precision\nmeasurements, they have reached a sensitivity which is now able to probe new physics\nbeyond the SM. LHC studies on the slepton sector will be complementary to the indirect\nprobes provided by these precision measurements.\nIX.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank M. Ramsey-Musolf, T.
