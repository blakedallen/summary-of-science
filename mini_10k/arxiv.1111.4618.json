Designing some\nBell's inequalities, we show that quantum no-cloning theorem can always be certified by Bell's theorem, and\nthis fact in turn reflects that our physical world is essentially nonlocal.\n\nIn classical information theory, one may duplicate an unknown state into many copies, by measuring these copies one\nmay accurately reveal the information of this unknown state.\nHowever, the situation dramatically changes when one turns\nto the quantum domain. Due to the Copenhagen probability interpretation of the quantum-state-collapse, contrary to\nthe classical case, it is impossible to determine with certainty\nan unknown quantum state when one owns only one copy of\nit. When measuring a quantum state, state-collapse happens\nso that one gets different measurement values of the eigenstates with probabilities. To experimentally identify a quantum state, one needs the process of quantum state tomography: one has to measure the states prepared by the same device for large numbers of times so as to get the information\nof probabilities corresponding to each eigenstate. Moreover,\nthe situation becomes even more worse because one cannot\nindeed make a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state, as\nindicated by the quantum no-cloning theorem [1\u20133].\nQuantum no-cloning theorem can be proved by using the\nsuperposition principle and the linearity of quantum transformations. The impossibility of perfect cloning seems at first\nannoying restriction, but it can be used favourably. During\nthe nearly 30 years since its discovery, the no-cloning theorem has had a significant impact on the development of quantum information theory: it renders the classical error corrections futile on quantum states [4, 5], and plays a vital role in\nthe security of quantum cryptography [6]. On the other hand,\nBell's theorem has been regarded as \"the most profound discovery in science\" [7]. Based on local hidden variable model,\nmultipartite systems separated by arbitrarily long distance satisfy some classical bounds in the form of Bell's inequalities,\nand the violation of which thus implies quantum nonlocality\n[8, 9]. As basic tenets in quantum information theory, the nocloning theorem and Bell's theorem have profound implications in quantum information and related fields. Despite these\nsignificant impacts, their deeper implication however has yet\nto be explored. In this work we investigate the connection between quantum no-cloning theorem and Bell's theorem. With\nthe presence of some Bell's inequalities, we show that quantum no-cloning theorem can always be certified by Bell's theorem.\nLet us briefly review the quantum no-cloning theorem. In\n\nthe simplest case of one qubit, initially one has as input an\narbitrary Schrodinger's cat state\n|\u03c8 sc i = cos\n\n\u03be\n\u03be\n|0i + sin ei\u03c6 |1i,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the parameters \u03be \u2208 [0, \u03c0], \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], and |0i and |1i\nare orthonormal bases for the two-dimensional system. If one\nhas an operation U2 duplicating the states |0i and |1i in the\nfollowing way: U2 |0i|0i \u2192 |0i|0i, U2 |1i|0i \u2192 |1i|1i, then\nthis yields an output quantum state as\nU2 |\u03c8 sc i|0i \u2192 |\u03c82 i = cos\n\n\u03be\n\u03be\n|0i|0i + sin ei\u03c6 |1i|1i,\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is obviously not equal to |\u03c8 sc i \u2297 |\u03c8 sc i. Therefore the\noperation U2 is not a quantum cloning machine (QCM), or a\nperfect 1 \u2192 2 quantum cloning is impossible. It is clear that\n|\u03c82 i is an entangled pure state of two qubits except \u03be = 0, \u03c0, it\nviolates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality\n[11] that reads\n1\n(Q11 + Q12 + Q21 \u2212 Q22 ) \u2264 1,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Qij (i, j = 1, 2) are correlation functions for two subsystems. The violation of the CHSH inequality by |\u03c82 i tells\nus the existence of nonlocality. Recall that |\u03c82 i is generated by the action of U2 on one-qubit Schr\u00f6dinger's cat state,\nsuch a nonlocal phenomenon of |\u03c82 i shows the impossibility of perfect quantum cloning. We then extend the consideration to N -qubit case. If there is an operation UN such\nthat UN |0i|0i * * * |0i \u2192 |0i|0i * * * |0i, UN |1i|0i * * * |0i \u2192\n|1i|1i * * * |1i, acting on the initial Schrodinger's cat state, we\nhave\nUN |\u03c8 sc i|0i * * * |0i \u2192\n\u03be\n\u03be\n|\u03c8N i = cos |0i|0i * * * |0i + sin ei\u03c6 |1i|1i * * * |1i.(4)\n2\n2\nThe state |\u03c8N i is an N -qubit entangled pure state rather than\na separable state |\u03c8 sc i \u2297 |\u03c8 sc i \u2297 * * * |\u03c8 sc i. This tells us that\nUN is not a perfect 1 \u2192 N QCM. According to the wellknown Gisin's theorem [10\u201315], any entangled pure state always violates some Bell's inequalities, thus the non-existence\nof 1 \u2192 N perfect QCM can be certified by Bell's theorem.\n\n\f2\nThen a natural question arises: Can this certification hold for\nmixed-state case?\nIn practical quantum information and computation protocols, noise is always an inevitable issue. In the presence of\nwhite noise, initially the input one-qubit Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\nstate is in a mixed state as follows\n1\u2212V\nI,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nP1\nwhere \u03c10 = |\u03c8 sc ih\u03c8 sc |, I = m=0 |mihm| is one-qubit identity matrix, I/2 represents the density matrix of white noise\nfor single qubit, and V \u2208 [0, 1] the so-called visibility. Furthermore one can recast \u03c1sc to a form as (1 + ~r * ~\u03c3 )/2 and\nfinds that \u03c1sc has indeed run over all the one-qubit states in\nthe Bloch sphere, here ~\u03c3 is Pauli matrix vector and ~r is the\nBloch vector. Through the action of U2 on \u03c1sc , one gets an\noutput state as\n\u03c12 = V |\u03c82 ih\u03c82 | +\n\n1 \u2212 V cn\nI2 ,\n2\n\nwhere\n= (|00ih00| + |11ih11|)/2 is the density matrix denoting colored noise for two qubits. It is obvious that\n\u03c12 is not equal to \u03c1sc \u2297 \u03c1sc . Let us examine the violation of\nthe CHSH inequality by the state \u03c12 . The quantum prediction for correlation function reads Qij = Tr(\u03c12 ~\u03c3n\u0302Ai \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Bj ),\nwith ~\u03c3n\u0302Ai = n\u0302Ai * ~\u03c3 , ~\u03c3n\u0302Bj = n\u0302Bj * ~\u03c3 (i, j = 1, 2),\nn\u0302Ai = (sin \u03b8Ai cos \u03c6Ai , sin \u03b8Ai sin \u03c6Ai , cos \u03b8Ai ) and n\u0302Bj =\n(sin \u03b8Bj cos \u03c6Bj , sin \u03b8Bj sin \u03c6Bj , cos \u03b8Bj ) (i, j = 1, 2) are\nunit vectors describing measurement directions for subsystems A and B respectively. Choose the measurement setting\nas \u03c6A1 = \u03c6B1 = \u03c6B2 = \u03b8A1 = 0, \u03b8A2 = \u03c0/2, \u03b8B2 =\nCHSH inequality\n\u2212\u03b8B1 , \u03c6A2 = \u03c6, the left-hand side of the p\n(3) becomes (cos \u03b8B1 + V sin \u03be sin \u03b8B1 ) \u2264 1 + (V sin \u03be)2 .\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the variation of the quantum violation versus\nvisibility V and parameter \u03be. It is clear that, except for the\npoints at V = 0, \u03be = 0, \u03c0, the output state \u03c12 always violates\nthe CHSH inequality (3) and hence exhibits there is no perfect\n1 \u2192 2 QCM. This result is remarkable: it tells us that the nonexistence of perfect 1 \u2192 2 QCM can be certified by Bell's\ntheorem even when initially the one-qubit Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\nstate is in the presence of white noise.\nThe above conclusion can be extended to the case of perfect\n1 \u2192 N QCM. Consider the state \u03c1N produced from \u03c1sc by the\naction of UN , we have\n1 \u2212 V cn\nIN ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\ncn\nwhere IN\n= |0...0ih0...0| + |1...1ih1...1|.

Except for the points at V = 0, \u03be = 0, \u03c0, the\nquantum prediction of the left-hand side of the CHSH inequality (3)\nis always larger than 1. The point of V = 0 represents the two-qubit\ncolored noise and the points of \u03be = 0, \u03c0 reflect separable states.\n\nwhere correlation functions Qi1 i2 ...iN = X1i1 X2i2 * * * XN iN ,\nXnin = \u00b11, and in indicating settings for each subsystems.\nProof.-For N = 2, the inequality (8) reduces to the CHSH\ninequality, thus we need to prove Theorem 1 from N = 4.\nWe firstly consider the four-qubit case and then generalize to\narbitrary even N . For N = 4, the inequality (8) reads\nI4 =\n\n1\n(Q1111 + Q1112 + ... + Q2222 ) \u2212 Q2222 \u2264 1.(9)\n8\n\nGiven Qijkl = ai bj ck dl , terms in the above bracket are simply the expansion of Y = 18 (a1 + a2 )(b1 + b2 )(c1 + c2 )(d1 +\nd2 ), which may take only three distinct values of {\u22122, 0, 2}\nbecause ai , bj , ck , dl = \u00b11. Moreover, the value of Q2222 is\nrelated to Y, hence the quantity I 4 has a certain upper bound.\nFor instance, when Y = 2, then Q2222 = a2 b2 c2 d2 = 1, so\nI 4 = 1; when Y = \u22122, then Q2222 = \u22121, so I 4 = \u22121; when\nY = 0, then I 4 \u2264 1 since Q2222 is either 1 or \u22121. Therefore\nthe inequality I 4 \u2264 1 holds for any situation.\nQuantum mechanically, the correlation function consists\nof two parts: Qijkl = V Q1 + (1 \u2212 V )Q2 where\nQ1 = Tr(|\u03c84 ih\u03c84 |~\u03c3n\u0302Ai \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Bj \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Ck \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Dl ), Q2 =\n1\ncn\n\u03c3n\u0302Ai \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Bj \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Ck \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302Dl ). The relative phase\n2 Tr(I4 ~\nangle \u03c6 in the state |\u03c8N i can be set to zero by some local\nunitary transformations, for our purpose. For simplicity, hereafter the relative phase is simply omitted. For four-qubit case,\ncalculation result shows\nQ1 = cos \u03b8ai cos \u03b8bj cos \u03b8ck cos \u03b8dl + sin \u03be sin \u03b8ai sin \u03b8bj\n\nQi1 i2 ...iN\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 Q22...2 \u2264 1, (8)\n\nQ2\n\n\u00d7 sin \u03b8ck sin \u03b8dl cos(\u03c6ai + \u03c6bj + \u03c6ck + \u03c6dl ),\n(10)\n= cos \u03b8ai cos \u03b8bj cos \u03b8ck cos \u03b8dl ,\n\n\f3\nand thus Qijkl\n=\ncos \u03b8ai cos \u03b8bj cos \u03b8ck cos \u03b8dl +\nIn the following,\nV sin \u03be sin \u03b8ai sin \u03b8bj sin \u03b8ck sin \u03b8dl .\nwe would like to choose some appropriate settings to\nsimplify the expression of I 4 . These settings are not the\noptimal settings that lead to the really maximal violation\nof I 4 , but sufficient to show clearly the quantum violation\nof the inequality (9). We choose the settings as follows:\n\u03c6ai = \u03c6bj = \u03c6ck = \u03c6dl = 0, \u03b8di = \u03b8ci = \u03b8bi = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8ai ,\n(i, j, k, l = 1, 2), then according to (9), the quantum\nmechanical expression of I 4 reads\n4\nIQM\n=\n\n1\n[\u2212(cos \u03b8a1 + cos \u03b8a2 )4\n8\n+V sin \u03be(sin \u03b8a1 + sin \u03b8a2 )4\n+8 cos4 \u03b8a2 \u2212 8V sin \u03be sin4 \u03b8a2 ].\n\n(11)\n\nNext, let \u03b8a2 = \u03c0, we have\n1\n[8 + V sin \u03be sin4 \u03b8a1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8a1 )4 ]\n8\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\ntan4 a21\nV sin \u03be sin4 \u03b8a1\n1\u2212\n. (12)\n= 1+\n8\nV sin \u03be\n\n4\nIQM\n=\n\nOne can verify that when 0 < \u03b8a1 < 2 arctan[(V sin \u03be)1/4 ],\n4\nIQM\nis always larger than 1. Hence the non-existence of 1 \u2192\n4 perfect QCM can be certified by Bell's inequality I 4 \u2264 1.\nThe generalization to arbitrary even-N case is straightforward. The summation term in (8) is binomial expansion of\nY = 2N1\u22121 (X11 + X12 )(X21 + X22 ) * * * (XN 1 + XN 2 ), which\nmay take only three distinct values of {\u22122, 0, 2}, and the value\nof Q22...2 is related to Y. Similar to the analysis of the fourqubit case, when Y = 2, then Q22...2 = 1, so I N = 1; when\nY = \u22122, then Q22...2 = \u22121, so I N = \u22121; when Y = 0, then\nI N \u2264 1 since Q22...2 is no larger than 1. Hence inequality\nI N \u2264 1 is always fulfilled in local hidden variable description. In quantum mechanics, we similarly have\n\nwith iN = 0 indicating that no measurement is performed on\nthe N -th qubit.\nProof.-Actually, Bell's inequality I N \u2264 1 in (8) also\nholds classically for the odd-N case. However, it cannot detect all the non-existence of 1 \u2192 N perfect QCM for the oddN case when the visibility V is sufficiently small, and due\nto this reason we resort to other form of Bell's inequalities.\nSubstituting XN 2 = 1 into inequality (8), one then arrives\nat Bell's inequality (15), which can certify that there are no\n1 \u2192 odd-N perfect QCM except V = 0, \u03be = 0, \u03c0.\nQuantum mechanically, the inequality (15) consists\nof two kinds of correlation functions, that is, full\nN -particle correlation Q = Tr(~\u03c3n\u03021 \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u03022 \u2297 * * * \u2297\n=\nV cos \u03be cos \u03b81i1 cos \u03b82i2 * * * cos \u03b8N iN +\n~\u03c3n\u0302N \u03c1N )\nV sin \u03be sin \u03b81i1 sin \u03b82i2 * * * sin \u03b8N iN cos(\u03c61i1 + \u03c62i2 + * * * +\n\u03c6N iN ) and (N \u2212 1)-particle correlation Q\u2032 = Tr(~\u03c3n\u03021 \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u03022 \u2297\n* * * \u2297 ~\u03c3n\u0302N \u22121 \u2297 1 \u03c1N ) = cos \u03b81i1 cos \u03b82i2 * * * cos \u03b8N iN .\nAfter setting \u03c61i1 = \u03c62i2 = * * * = \u03c6N iN = 0,\n\u03b8nin = \u03c02 \u00d7 in , (n 6= 1), and \u03b812 = 0, then one\nfinds that Q111...11 = V sin \u03be sin \u03b811 ,\nQ122...20 =\n\u2212 cos \u03b811 , Q222...20 = \u22121, and the others are zeros. Hence\nthe quantum expression of I N in (15) becomes\n1\n(V sin \u03be sin \u03b811 \u2212 cos \u03b811 \u2212 1)\n2N \u22121 \u0014\n\u0015\np\n1\n2\n1 + (V sin \u03be) sin(\u03b811 + \u2206) \u2212 1 ,\n= 1 + N \u22121\n2\n(16)\n\nN\nIQM\n= 1+\n\n1\n1\nwith \u2206 = \u2212 arctan V sin\n\u03be . When 2 arctan V sin \u03be < \u03b811 <\nN\n\u03c0, one has IQM > 1. Therefore the violation of Bell's theorem always exists for the odd-N case. This ends the proof.\nIn summary, starting from an input single-qubit\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat state, the non-existence of perfect 1 \u2192 N\nQCM can always be certified by Bell's theorem even in the\npresence of noise. Because of the no-cloning theorem, the\nQi1 i2 ...iN = cos \u03b81i1 cos \u03b82i2 * * * cos \u03b8N iN\ninput one-qubit Schr\u00f6dinger's cat state cannot be perfectly\n+V sin \u03be sin \u03b81i1 sin \u03b82i2 * * * sin \u03b8N iN\ncopied, and this results in the violation of Bell's inequalities\n\u00d7 cos(\u03c61i1 + \u03c62i2 + * * * + \u03c6N iN ).
