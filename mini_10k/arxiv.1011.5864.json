By combining properties\nof N = 2 supergravity and superstring theory, a number of interesting phenomena, such as split flow\ntree, entropy enigma, bound state recombination walls, and microstate counting have been investigated\n(see e.g. [6]-[17]; as examples of earlier studies, see e.g. [18]).\nIn the supergravity approximation, the detailed study of the split attractor flow is made possible,\nin the limit of large (continuous) charges, by the powerful restrictions imposed by electric-magnetic\nduality (U -duality1 ).\nAn important ingredient in the study of attractor solutions in supergravity is the concept of duality\ncharge orbits, and of the duality invariants associated to them. In the past, a number of studies has\n1\nHere U -duality is referred to as the \"continuous\" limit (valid for large values of the charges) of the non-perturbative\nstring theory symmetries introduced by Hull and Townsend in [19].\n\n1\n\n\fled to a rather complete classification of charge orbits for single-center extremal BHs, and of their\nsupersymmetry-preserving properties characterising the corresponding BH background [20]-[28].\nAfter [2], it is known that in generic N = 2 theories all scalar fields (belonging to Abelian vector\nmultiplets) are stabilized in terms of the charges in the near-horizon extremal BH geometry corresponding to a ( 12 -)BPS attractor configuration. On the other hand, for N = 2 non-BPS attractors,\nas well as for both BPS and non-BPS attractors in N > 2-extended theories, not all scalar fields are\nstabilized at the BH event horizon [29], and \"moduli spaces\" of attractor solutions exist [30].\nIn d = 4 supergravity theories, the fluxes of the two-form Abelian field-strengths and their duals fit\ninto the relevant (symplectic) irrepr. R of the U -duality group G4 . When considering a(n extremal)\n1-center black 0-brane (BH) background, such fluxes are referred to as electric and magnetic black hole\ncharges. The irrepr. charge space R exhibits a stratification in terms of disjoint orbits, each of them\nsupporting a distinct class of 1-center BH solutions [20]-[28]. Within theories with symmetric coset\nG4\n(where H4 is the maximal symmetric subgroup of G4 ), a unique duality-invariant\nscalar manifolds H\n4\npolynomial of the charge irrepr. R of G4 (in which the charges of a 1-center BH sit) exists.\nThis is a quadratic polynomial I2 in N = 2 symmetric special K\u00e4hler (SK) geometries with vanishing C-tensor (minimal coupling sequence [31]). The same is also true for the general N = 3 theory\n[32] and for \"pure\" N = 4 supergravity [33] (the so-called axion-dilaton model, whose truncation\ndown to N = 2 gives rise to the CP1 model - first element of the minimal coupling sequence - in a\nnon-manifestly U (1, 1)-covariant symplectic basis).\nOn the other hand, symmetric d-special K\u00e4hler geometries (for a comprehensive treatment, see\ne.g. [34]), based on degree-3 Euclidean Jordan algebras [35, 36], have a unique duality-invariant\npolynomial I4 which is quartic in charges. Some of these theories correspond to certain classical limits\nof moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau internal manifolds in superstring compactifications [12]. In particular,\nthe simplest d-SK geometry, namely the symmetric t3 model (see Sec. 7, and Refs. therein), pertains\nto the volume modulus in the large volume limit of compactifications of Type II superstrings on\nCalabi-Yau threefolds.\nFor p-center (extremal) BHs, the study of charge orbits and duality invariants is not known yet.\nThe unique exception is given by the above mentioned minimal coupling CPn sequence; indeed, the\n2-center dynamics, marginal stability and the properties of the related split attractor flows have been\nrecently shown to depend on four U -duality invariants in [37] (in the same paper, a generalisation to\np(> 3)-center solutions was indicated, as well).\nThe present investigation is devoted to the study of duality charge orbits supporting 2-center\nextremal BHs in N = 2 symmetric d-SK geometry based on the so-called Jordan symmetric infinite\nsequence [36]\nSO (2, n)\nSL (2, R)\n\u00d7\n(R \u2295 \u03931,n\u22121 ) ,\n(1.1)\nN =2:\nU (1)\nSO (2) \u00d7 SO (n)\n\nwhere the round brackets in the right-hand side denote the corresponding reducible degree-3 Euclidean\nJordan algebras [35, 36] (see also e.g. [38], and Refs. therein). In particular, we will focus on the\nsymmetric minimal rank-3 stu model [40, 41] (which is a sub-sector of all symmetric d-SK geometries)\nand its lower-rank descendants, namely the st2 and t3 models.\nIn general, in presence of a p center (extremal) BH solution (p \u2208 N), the number Ip of independent\nG4 -invariant polynomials built out with p distinct copies of the charge irrepr. R of G4 is given by the\nformula\npdimR R = dimR Op + Ip ,\n(1.2)\nwhere\nOp \u2261\n\nG4\nH4,p\n\n(1.3)\n\nis the relevant p-center charge orbit, spanned by a vector of fluxes of real dimension pdimR R. In\ngeneral, the counting of Ip given by the formulae (1.2)-(1.3) depends only on the compact form of the\n2\n\n\fsymmetry groups involved, and thus it is not affected by the supersymmetry properties exhibited by\nthe corresponding p-center BH background.\nFor example, in the case of BPS p-center extremal BHs in N = 2 minimally coupled supergravity\n[31], one obtains (p 6 n + 1; see Sec. 4.2.1 of [37])\n\uf8fc\npdimR R = 2 (n + 1) p; \uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\u21d2 Ip = p 2 .\n(1.4)\n\uf8f4\nU (1,n)\n\uf8fe\nOBP S,p =\nU (n+1\u2212p)\n\nA new phenomenon occurring when p > 1 is the fact that the various G4 -invariant polynomials\narrange into irreprs. (multiplets) of an \"horizontal\" symmetry group, encoding the combinatoric\nstructure of the p-center solutions of the theory. In the N = 2 minimally coupled theory, such an\n\"horizontal\" group is given by Uh (p) [37] (the subscript \"h\" stands for \"horizontal\" throughout). On\nthe other hand, for the cubic models considered in the present paper it is2 SLh (p, R) (see Sec. 4).\nFor all N = 2 theories, dimR R = 2nV + 2, where nV is the number of Abelian vector multiplets\ncoupled to the gravity multiplets. Thus, at least for N = 2 symmetric coset vector multiplets' scalar\nmanifolds, the dimension of a \"large\" charge orbit Op=1 reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\nG4\n= dimR R \u2212 1,\n(1.5)\ndimR Op=1 = 2nV + 1 = dimR\nH4,0\nwhere H4 = H4,0 \u00d7 U (1) is the maximal compact subgroup of G4 , as well as the stabilizer of the scalar\nmanifold itself. Thus, the application of general relation (1.2) to the N = 2 1-center case (1.5) (which\ncan be traced back to the very structure of SK geometry [20, 23]) yields to the well known result\nIp=1 = dimR R\u2212dimR Op=1 = 1,\n\n(1.6)\n\nand the \"large\" nature of Op=1 means that it supports a non-vanishing value of the unique G4 -invariant.\nAs mentioned above, we will focus on the stu, st2 and t3 d-SK geometries, respectively corresponding\nto the rank-3, rank-2 and rank-1 symmetric cosets (see the treatment of Secs. 2, 6 and 7 for more\ndetail, and Refs. Therein):\n\u0014\n\nSL (2, R)\nU (1)\nF =stu\n\n\u00153 \u0014\n\u0015\nSL (2, R) 2 SL (2, R)\n,\n.\n,\nU (1)\nU (1)\n\n(1.7)\n\nF =t3\n\nF =st2\n\n\u0001\nThe charge irrepr. R respectively is the (2, 2, 2) (spin s = 12 , 12 , 12 ) of [SL (2, R)]3 , the (3, 2) (spin\n\u0001\ns = 1, 12 ) of [SL (2, R)]2 , and the (4) (spin s = 23 ) of [SL (2, R)] (see also the discussion in Sec. 5\nof [42]). For these models, the generic (\"large\") p = 2-center charge orbit Op=2 has no continuous\nstabilizer, so it just coincides with G4 itself. Thus, the application of the general formula (1.2) with\np = 2 in the theories under consideration yields that\nIp=2 = 7 , 6 , 5 .\nstu\n\nst2\n\nt3\n\n(1.8)\n\nAs discussed in Sec. 3 within the (manifestly G4 -covariant) so-called Calabi-Vesentini3 basis [43,\n44, 41], a remarkable property of the stu and st2 models is that G4 is reducible (namely, factorised:\nG4 = [SL (2, R)]3 for stu, and G4 = [SL (2, R)]2 for st2 ). This generally allows for the existence of\nmore independent G4 -invariant polynomials with respect to symmetric theories with irreducible G4\n(such as the N = 2 \"magic\" models [35, 36]). Actually, both the whole N = 2 Jordan symmetric\n2\n\nActually, in these cases the horizontal symmetry group is GL (p, R), where the additional scale symmetry with respect\nto SL (p, R) is encoded by the homogeneity of the G4 -invariant polynomials in charges.\n3\nThe Calabi-Vesentini basis for charges and holomorphic sections is discussed in App. B.\n\n3\n\n\fsequence (1.1) (whose the stu and st2 models are the n = 2 and n = 1 element, respectively) and\nthe sequence pertaining to N = 4 supergravity (see Eq. (9.1) further below) have factorised scalar\nmanifolds, and the aforementioned property (as well as the possibility to perform a Calabi-Vesentini\nmanifestly G4 -covariant treatment) extends to these two infinite sequences. It is here worth pointing\nout that, for symmetric d-SK geometries, the reducible (irreducible) nature of G4 is ultimately due to\nthe reducibility (irreducibility) of the underlying rank-3 Euclidean Jordan algebra (for the reducible\ncases, see Eqs. (1.1) and (9.1)).\nFor the stu model, in Sec. 2 we will show that there is a basis of seven independent [SL (2, R)]3 invariant homogeneous polynomials, six of them are quartic and the one is quadratic in charges.\nWithin the notation specified in Sec. 4, these polynomial invariants arrange as follows:\nW \u2261 hQ1 , Q2 i quadratic in charges (see Eq. (4.11));\n\n(1.9)\n\n(I, X ) quartic in charges (see Eq. (4.5)),\nwhere I is a quintet of five invariants, and hQ1 , Q2 i denotes the symplectic product of the charge\nvectors pertaining to the two centers.\nFor the st2 and t3 models, in which the number of independent G4 -invariants is smaller, we will\nexhibit polynomial constraints, manifestly invariant under the aforementioned \"horizontal\" symmetry\nSLh (2, R), which relate such invariants. We anticipate that both W and X of Eq. (1.9) are singlets\nunder SLh (2, R), whereas I sit in an irrepr. 5 (spin s = 2) of SLh (2, R) itself (see(4.5)). In the stu\nmodel, the relevant polynomial constraint has the (order-12 in charges) structure (see Eq. (5.6) for\nexplicit form):\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n(1.10)\nP12 I6 , W, X , Tr I2 , Tr I3 = 0,\n\u0001\nwhich always allows one e.g. to eliminate Tr I3 in terms of I6 , and vice versa. As detailed in App.\nA, the further reduction to the st2 model gives rise to a polynomial of order-16 in charges structure\n(see Eqs. (6.10) and (6.12) for explicit form):\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nP16 W, X , Tr I2 , Tr I3 = 0,\n(1.11)\n\nand it can be regarded a fourth order algebraic equation for W 2 . In the t3 model, a relation of type\n(1.11) (with P16 given by (6.12)) also holds, together with the further constraint X = 0 (see Eq.\n(7.16)), of order 4 in charges. Note that\n\u0001 the quintet\n\u0001 I enters Eqs. (1.10) and (1.11) only through the\nSLh (2, R)-invariant expressions Tr I2 and Tr I3 , respectively\ngiven by Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10).\n\u0001\n3\nAlternatively, by using (1.10), one can replace Tr I with I6 (defined in (3.16)) as generator of a\ncomplete lowest-degree basis (8.2) of manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomials. Thus, Eq. (1.11)\ngets replaced by the degree-8 constraint (6.11), which is nothing but the vanishing of the determinant\nof a suitably defined Gramian matrix G (defined by (8.4)-(8.5)).\nThe paper is organised as follows.\nIn Sec. 2 we recall the stu model and its properties (in the \"special coordinates\" symplectic frame).\nIn Sec. 3 we introduce a general formalism for the construction and analysis of polynomial G4 invariants in all cases in which G4 is factorised. This formalism is worked out in the Calabi-Vesentini\nbasis [44], and it is based on the so-called T-tensor; we also briefly outline the relation between\nthe T-tensor and the corresponding counterpart for irreducible cubic geometries. In particular, this\nformalism applies to stu and st2 since they are, as mentioned above, the n = 2 and n = 1 element of\nthe N = 2 Jordan symmetric sequence (1.1), respectively. The application to the rank-1 irreducible\nt3 model deserves a separate treatment, given in App. B.\nSec. 4 analyzes the crucial role played by the \"horizontal\" symmetry SLh (2, R) (generalisable\nto SLh (p, R) for p > 3 centers) in classifying the polynomial G4 -invariants and in determining the\nstructure of the polynomial constraints relating them. In particular, for each order of homogeneity\n4\n\n\fin charges, the various G4 -invariants arrange into irreprs. (multiplet) of the \"horizontal\" symmetry\nitself.\nIn Sec. 5 the issue of independence (primitivity) of the G4 -invariant in the models under consideration is addressed. Besides the explicit computation based on the analysis of the rank of a suitably\ndefined Jacobian matrix, also the general counting argument based on formula (1.2) is given. A polynomial constraint of degree 12 in charges, involving also the unique G4 -invariant polynomial of order\nsix in charges (singlet under SLh (2, R)) is given (and derived in detail in App. A).\nThen, in Secs. 6 and 7 the reduction of the stu to st2 respectively t3 model is performed, and in App.\nA the corresponding hierarchy of manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial constraints (consistent\nwith the result (1.8)) is derived.\nIn Sec. 8 we develop further the analysis of invariant polynomials, by combining the \"horizontal\"\nsymmetry SLh (2, R) with the \"vertical\" symmetry SLv (2, R). This latter, for the models treated in\nthe present paper, is part of the d = 4 U -duality group G4 . Then, we use the characteristic equation of\nthe Gramian matrix G to exploit a manifestly [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 SL (2, R)]-invariant formalism, actually\nholding for both the infinite reducible sequences (1.1) and (9.1) of symmetric scalar manifolds.\nFinally, in Sec. 9 the extension of the previous analysis to generic elements of the N = 2 Jordan\nsymmetric and N = 4 reducible infinite sequences is discussed; for the N = 2 sequence with n > 3\nand for the whole N = 4 sequence (n > 0), the treatment is analogous, and the results identical, to\nthe case of the stu model considered in Sec. 2.\nThree Appendices conclude the paper. In App. A we give details on the derivation of the relevant\npolynomial constraints in stu, st2 and t3 models. App. B discusses the relation between the usual\n\"special coordinates\" symplectic basis (used in D-brane description) and the Calabi-Vesentini basis.\nApp. C presents a complete basis for the SO (n, C)-invariant polynomials, a rigorous result mentioned\nin Sec. 8.\nWe should point out that, although we perform an analysis for BPS (\"large\") multi-center extremal\nBHs, the extension to non-BPS \"large\" as well as to \"small\" BHs is straightforward. Strictly speaking,\nit is worth recalling that, at the best of our current understanding (see e.g. [39]), the marginal decay\nand split attractor flow can be generalised to N = 2 non-BPS cases only with I4 > 0 (namely, the\nZH = 0 attractors). Anyhow, the analysis of p-center charge orbits can be carried out for all cases\n(see the comments below Eq. (1.3)).\n\n2\n\nThe stu Model\n\nWe start and consider the so-called N = 2, d = 4 stu model [40, 41].

This coset is the second element (n = 2) of the aforementioned N = 2, d = 4 Jordan\nsymmetric sequence (see e.g. [48, 34], and Refs. therein).\nThis model admits all classes of extremal BH attractors [1, 2], namely 12 -BPS, non-BPS ZH 6= 0 and\nnon-BPS ZH = 0 ones. The BPS solutions were known after [41, 49], whereas the explicit expression of\nthe non-BPS ZH = 0 attractors have been obtained in [42]. The non-BPS ZH 6= 0 attractor solutions\nwere obtained in full generality in [46] (see also Refs. therein, as well as [47]).\nBy introducing the Sp (8, R)-vector of magnetic and electric charges (the naught index pertains to\nthe graviphoton throughout)\n\u0001T\n(2.7)\nQ \u2261 p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 , q 0 , q 1 , q 2 , q 3 ,\nin the \"special coordinate basis\" the unique polynomial\ninvariant (homogeneous and quartic in the\n\u0001\ncharges) of the (2, 2, 2) (namely spin s = 12 , 12 , 12 ) irrepr. of G4 = [SL (2, R)]3 reads\nI4 (Q) \u2261 \u2212 p0\n\n\u00012\n\nq02 \u2212 p1\n\n\u00012\n\nq12 \u2212 p2\n\n\u00012\n\nq22 \u2212 p3\n\n\u00012\n\nq32\n\n\u22122p0 q0 p1 q1 \u2212 2p0 q0 p2 q2 \u2212 2p0 q0 p3 q3 + 2p1 q1 p2 q2 + 2p1 q1 p3 q3 + 2p2 q2 p3 q3\n+4q0 p1 p2 p3 \u2212 4p0 q1 q2 q3 = \u2212Det (\u03c8) ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere Det(\u03c8) is the so-called Cayley's hyperdeterminant [50].

Furthermore, they both vanish in\nthe 1-center limit 1 \u2261 2.\nAlso the polynomial I6 defined by (3.16) is a singlet of the horizontal symmetry SLh (2, R); it is\nantisymmetric under 1 \u2194 2, and it vanishes when 1 \u2261 2.\nThe very same properties are shared by the quadratic invariant given by the symplectic product\n(\u03a9 denoting here the Sp (8, R) metric)\nW \u2261 hQ1 , Q2 i \u2261 QT1 \u03a9Q2\n\n= \u2212p0 Q0 \u2212 p1 Q1 \u2212 p2 Q2 \u2212 p3 Q3 + q0 P 0 + q1 P 1 + q2 P 2 + q3 P 3 ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhich is nothing but the \u03b7-trace of the antisymmetric T-tensor defined by (4.2):\nW = \u03b7 \u039b\u03a3 Ta,\u039b\u03a3 (Q1 Q2 ) \u2261 Tr (Ta ) .\n\n(4.12)\n\nThus, W is an SLh (2, R)-singlet, antisymmetric under 1 \u2194 2.\nBy recalling (4.3) and (4.12), a particular combination of SLh (2, R)-singlets (symmetric under\n1 \u2194 2) which will be relevant in the subsequent treatment can be defined as follows:\n\u0001 1\n1\nX \u2261 2 kTk2 \u2212 Tr2 (Ta ) = 2 I\u2032 \u2212 I\u2032\u2032 \u2212 W 2 .\n2\n2\n9\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fNote that both (4.11) and (4.13) vanish when 1 \u2261 2.\nAn equivalent group theoretical characterization of the quartic invariants I+2 , I+1 , I0 , I\u22121 and I\u22122\nfit them into a rank-4 completely symmetric tensor of the fundamental irrepr. 2 of SLh (2, R) itself.\nThis interpretation enjoys an immediate generalisation to the case of p centers. Indeed, as mentioned in Sec. 4, in this case the \"horizontal\" combinatorics symmetry group is SLh (p, R).\nAs\nPpa consequence, the quartic polynomial G4 -invariants which can be obtained by computing\nI4 ( a=1 Qa ) sit in the rank-4 completely symmetric\n\u0001 tensor product of the fundamental irrepr. p of\nSLh (p, R), and their number is thus given by p+3\n4 , which yields 1 for p = 1 (namely, I4 (Q)), 5 for\np = 2, 15 for p = 3, etc.\nFurthermore, the quadratic polynomial G4 -invariants (antisymmetric under 1 \u2194 2) sit in the rank-2\nantisymmetric tensor product of the fundamental irrepr. 2 of SLh (p, R), and their number is thus\n, which yields 0 for p = 1, 1 for p = 2 (namely, the symplectic product W \u2261 hQ1 , Q2 i), 3\ngiven by p(p\u22121)\n2\nfor p = 3 (namely, the three symplectic products W1 \u2261 hQ1 , Q2 i, W2 \u2261 hQ1 , Q3 i and W3 \u2261 hQ2 , Q3 i),\net cetera. The very same holds for the sextic G4 -polynomial invariant I6 defined by (3.16).\n\n5\n\nIndependent Invariants, Constraints\nand their st2 and t3 Descendants\n\nWe now face the issue of the independence of the various G4 -invariants introduced so far, namely\nI+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W and I6 , which is directly related to the explicit derivation of the various\nconstraints among them.\nGenerally, an effective method to check the functional relations (if any) holding within a given set of\nG4 -invariants is the one based on the analysis of the Jacobian matrix. In the case under consideration,\none defines the rectangular 8 \u00d7 16 Jacobian matrix J\nJ\u2261\nwhere\n\n(5.1)\n\n\u0001\nI \u2261 I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W, I6 ,\n\nand (\u03b1 = 1, ..., 16)\nQ\u03b1 \u2261 QT1 , QT2\n\n\u2202I\n,\n\u2202Q\u03b1\n\n\u0001T\n\n= p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , q 0 , q 1 , q 2 , q 3 , P 0 , P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , Q0 , Q1 , Q2 , Q3\n\nis the charge vector spanning the 16-dimensional real vector space\nV \u2261 V1 \u2295 V2 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\u0001T\n\n(5.3)\n\n(5.4)\n\n\u0001\nwhere Vi is the 8-dimensional irrepr. space of the (2, 2, 2) (spin s = 21 , 12 , 12 ) of the U -duality group\n[SL (2, R)]3 , in which the magnetic and electric charges of the BH at center i = 1, 2 sit.\nBy direct computation, one can check that the rank of the matrix J is seven; in other words, all\nminors of rank eight of J do vanish, whereas all minors of order seven are non-zero.\nA first way to explain the rank seven of J is as follows.\nThe whole vector space spanned by the charge vector Q\u03b1 (5.3) of the two BH centers in the stu\nmodel is given by the 16-dimensional space V defined in (5.4). On the other hand, the generic (BPS)\norbit of Q\u03b1 is given by O = SL (2, R) \u00d7 SO (2, 2) itself, and thus it is 9-dimensional. Thus, the general\nformulae (1.2)-(1.3) yield that\ndimR V = dimR O + Ip=2 ,\n(5.5)\nwhere V is spanned by the multi-center charge vector Q belonging to the multi-center orbit O. Thus,\nin the stu model the number of polynomial invariants is Ip=2 = 16 \u2212 9 = 7, in agreement with the\n10\n\n\fcomputations reported above. One can also check that (1.2) applied to the 1-center case of stu model\ntrivially yields the correct result, namely Ip=1 = 8 \u2212 7 = 1 (i.e., the quartic invariant (2.8) - in \"special\ncoordinates\" basis or, equivalently (3.9) - in Calabi-Vesentini basis).\nAs we will prove in App. A, a polynomial constraint of order 12 relates the eight [SL (2, R)]3 invariant polynomials introduced so far, namely:\nP12,stu \u2261 I26 + W X I6 + Tr(I3 ) +\n\nTr(I2 ) W 2 Tr(I2 ) X\nW6 W4 X 5 W2 X 2 4 X 3\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n= 0 (5.6)\n12\n3\n432\n36\n36\n27\n\nThis manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial constraint makes the counting of independent G4 invariant polynomials perfectly consistent with the result and analysis presented above. Namely, in\nthe stu model, the eight [SL (2, R)]3 -invariant polynomials I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W and I6 are\nconstrained by the 12-degree relation (5.6). Thus, the number of 2-center independent [SL (2, R)]3 invariant polynomials in the stu model is Ip=2 = 8 \u2212 1 = 7, in agreement with the result (both from\nJacobian analysis and general counting) discussed above.\nAs discussed in Secs. 6 and 7 (as well as in App. A), the further reduction of the constraint (5.6) to\nthe st2 and t3 models give rise to an hierarchy of manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial relations\namong the various G4 -invariants.\n\n6\n\nThe st2 Model\n\nThrough a suitable reduction procedure (see App. A, as well as Sec. 5 of [42]), the stu model gives\nrise to the so-called N = 2, d = 4 st2 model. In the \"special coordinates\" symplectic frame (see e.g.\n[45] and Refs. therein), this model is defined by the prepotential\nF (X) \u2261\ns \u2261\n\nX1 X2\nX iX j X k\n1\ndijk\n=\n3!\nX0\nX0\n1\n2\nX\nX\n, t \u2261 0.\n0\nX\nX\n\n\u00012\n\n= X0\n\n\u00012\n\nst2 \u21d4 d122 = 2;\n\n(6.1)\n(6.2)\n\nThe Sp (6, R)-vector of holomorphic symplectic sections can thus be written as follows:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nV\u2261\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nX0\nX1\nX2\nF0\nF1\nF2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\n1\ns\nt\n\u2212st2\nt2\n2st\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 0 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7X = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\n1\ns\nt\n\u2212F\nF1\nF2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 0\n\uf8f7X .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(6.3)\n\nHere we will not report a detailed treatment of the st2 model (we address the reader e.g. to [42, 46, 47]),\nwe will just confine ourselves to some basics, useful for the developments given below.\nThe st2 model is the unique example of d-SK geometry with dimC = 2 (corresponding to nV = 2\nvector multiplets). It is based on the rank-2 factorised symmetric coset\n\u0014\n\u0015\nSL (2, R) 2\nSL (2, R) SO (2, 1)\nG4\n,\n=\n\u00d7\n\u223c\nH4\nU (1)\nSO (2)\nU (1)\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere G4 = [SL (2, R)]2 is the d = 4 U -duality group, and H4 = [U (1)]2 its mcs. This coset, with\nconstant curvature \u22123 [52], is the first element (n = 1) of the infinite sequence of reducible SK\nSO(2,n)\nsymmetric cosets SL(2,R)\nU (1) \u00d7 SO(2)\u00d7SO(n) (the so-called Jordan symmetric sequence; see e.g. [48, 34],\nand Refs. therein).\n11\n\n\fAs the stu model, the st2 model admits all classes of extremal BH attractors [1] (for a general\nanalysis and the treatment of attractor-supporting charge orbits, see e.g. [23]). The BPS solutions\nwere known after [41, 49], whereas the explicit expression of the non-BPS ZH = 0 attractors have been\nobtained in [42]. The non-BPS ZH 6= 0 attractor solutions can also be obtained, through a \" stu \u2192 st2\nreduction\" procedure (see e.g. Sect. 5 of [42]), by performing the (near-)horizon limit (\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) of\nthe general expressions of the 21 -BPS and non-BPS ZH 6= 0 attractor flows of the stu model, obtained\nin full generality in [46] (see also Refs. therein, as well as [47]).\nBy introducing the Sp (6, R)-vector of charges\nQ \u2261 p0 , p1 , p2 , q 0 , q 1 , q 2\n\n\u0001T\n\n,\n\n(6.5)\n\nin the \"special coordinate basis\" the unique\u0001 polynomial invariant (homogeneous and quartic in the\ncharges) of the (2, 3) (namely spin s = 12 , 1 ) of the U -duality group [SL (2, R)]2 reads\nI4 (Q) = \u2212 p0\n\n\u00012\n\nq02 \u2212 p1\n\n\u00012\n\nq12 \u2212 2p0 q0 p1 q1 \u2212 2p0 q0 p2 q2 + 2p1 q1 p2 q2 + 4q0 p1 p2\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2212 p0 q1 q22 ,\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhich can be obtained from (2.9) by specifying d122 = 2 and d122 = 1/2, consistently with the nonlinear relation (2.10).\nBy considering 2-center extremal BHs in the st2 model, with the charge vectors associated to the\ntwo centers respectively reading\nQ1 \u2261\nQ2 \u2261\n\np0 , p1 , p2 , q 0 , q 1 , q 2\n\n\u0001T\n\n;\n\nP 0 , P 1 , P 2 , Q0 , Q1 , Q2\n\n(6.7)\n\u0001T\n\n,\n\n(6.8)\n\nthe eight G4 -invariant polynomials I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W and I6 can be obtained from their\nvery definitions (3.10)-(3.15), (4.11) and (3.16) by simply specifying \u039b = 0, 1, 2 (and thus using the\nmetric \u03b7\u039b\u03a3 = \u03b7 \u039b\u03a3 of SO (2, 1) to raise and lower the indices).\nIn order to establish the independence of such 2-center [SL (2, R)]2 -invariants introduced above,\nwe will exploit the Jacobian method used above for the stu model, adapted to the model under\nconsideration. To this end, one defines the rectangular 6 \u00d7 12 Jacobian matrix J (5.1), where I is\ndefined in (5.2),with (\u03b1 = 1, ..., 12)\nQ\u03b1 \u2261 QT1 , QT2\n\n\u0001T\n\n= p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , q 0 , q 1 , q 2 , P 0 , P 1 , P 2 , Q0 , Q1 , Q2\n\n\u0001T\n\n(6.9)\n\nis the charge vector spanning the 12-dimensional vector\n\u0001 space V given by (5.4), where now Vi is the\n6-dimensional irrepr. space of the (2, 3) (spin s = 12 , 1 ) of the U -duality group [SL (2, R)]2 , in which\nthe magnetic and electric charges of the BH at center i = 1, 2 sit.\nBy direct computation, one can check that the rank of the matrix J for the st2 model is six; in\nother words, all minors of rank six of J are non-zero, whereas all minors of rank seven and eight do\nvanish.\nSimilarly to the discussion done for the stu model, a simple venue for the explanation for the rank\nsix of J in the st2 model is as follows.\nThe whole vector space spanned by the charge vector Q\u03b1 (6.9) of the two BH centers in the st2\nmodel is given by the 12-dimensional space V defined in (5.4). On the other hand, the generic (BPS)\norbit of Q\u03b1 is given by O = SL (2, R)\u00d7SO (2, 1) itself, and thus it is 6-dimensional. Thus, by applying\nthe relation (1.2) (holding in the theory of polynomial invariants of Lie groups) to the st2 model, the\nfinal result on the number of polynomial invariants is Ip=2 = 12 \u2212 6 = 6, in agreement with the\ncomputations reported above. One can also check that (1.2) applied to the 1-center case of st2 model\ntrivially yields the correct result, namely Ip=1 = 6 \u2212 5 = 1 (i.e., the quartic invariant (6.6) - in \"special\ncoordinates\" basis or, equivalently (3.9) - in Calabi-Vesentini basis).\n\n12\n\n\fThe above counting of independent 2-center polynomial invariants of the U -duality group [SL (2, R)]2\nof the st2 model is consistent with the number of independent, manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial relations holding for the st2 model itself.\nIndeed, as we will detail in App. A, starting from the stu model and its constraint (5.6), a suitable\nreduction to st2 model determines the following two manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant constraints:\nP16,st2\nP8,st2\nwhere\n\n\u0001\n64\n16\n8\n32\nTr I2 X 2 + W 4 X 2 + W 2 X 3 + X 4 = 0;\n3\u0001\n9\n27\n9\n\u2261 \u221212 Tr I2 + 24 I6 W + (W 2 + 2X )2 = 0,\n\n\u2261 P16,t3 \u2212\n\n(6.10)\n(6.11)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n8\n1\nP16,t3 \u2261 16Tr2 I2 + 64Tr I3 W 2 + Tr I2 W 4 \u2212 W 8 .\n(6.12)\n3\n27\nNote that (6.11) expresses I6 in terms of the other invariants, whereas (6.10) is the constraint which\ndecreases the number of independent polynomial invariants from seven to six.\nIt is also worth pointing out that the very structure of constraints (5.6) and (6.12) is determined\nby the underlying SLh (2, R)-invariance; for instance, this latter constrains the inhomogeneous term\nof (6.12) to be the square of the coefficient of W 4 in the same equation. Also, the fact that a term\nproportional to W 6 is missing in Eq. (6.12) is due to the tracelessness of I itself (recall (4.5)): TrI = 0.\nThe manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial constraints (6.11)-(6.10) make the counting of independent G4 -invariant polynomials perfectly consistent with the result and analysis presented above.\nNamely, in the st2 model, the eight [SL (2, R)]2 -invariant polynomials I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W\nand I6 are constrained by the 8-degree and 16-degree relations respectively given by Eqs. (6.11) and\n(6.10). Thus, the number of 2-center independent [SL (2, R)]2 -invariant polynomials in the st2 model\nis Ip=2 = 8 \u2212 2 = 6, in agreement with the result (both from Jacobian analysis and general counting)\ndiscussed above.\n\n7\n\nThe t3 Model\n\nThrough a suitable reduction procedure (see App. A, as well as Sec. 5 of [42]), the stu model gives\nrise to the so-called N = 2, d = 4 t3 model.

It is based on the rank-1 symmetric\ncoset\nSL (2, R)\nG4\n=\n,\n(7.3)\nH4\nU (1)\nwhere G4 = SL (2, R) is the d = 4 U -duality group, and H4 = U (1) its maximal compact subgroup\n(mcs). This coset, with constant curvature \u2212 23 [52], is an isolated case within the classification of\nhomogeneous symmetric non-compact SK manifolds (see e.g. [48, 34], and Refs. therein).\nThrough the definition (7.2) of the projective coordinate t, the Sp (4, R)-vector of holomorphic\nsymplectic sections can thus be written as follows:\n\uf8eb 0 \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n1\n1\n\uf8ec X1 \uf8f7 \uf8ec t \uf8f7 0 \uf8ec t \uf8f7 0\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nV\u2261\uf8ec\n(7.4)\n\uf8ed F0 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed \u2212t3 \uf8f8 X = \uf8ed \u2212F \uf8f8 X .\nF1\n3t2\nF1\n13\n\n\fBy introducing the Sp (4, R)-vector of magnetic and electric charges\n\u0001T\nQ \u2261 p0 , p, q0 , q ,\n\n(7.5)\n\nthe unique invariant (homogeneous quartic polynomial in the charges) of the 4 (spin s = 3/2) irrepr.\nof the U -duality group SL (2, R) reads (in the \"special coordinates\" symplectic frame)\nI4 (Q) \u2261 \u2212 p0\n\n\u00012\n\n1\n4\nq02 + p2 q 2 \u2212 2p0 q0 pq + 4q0 p3 \u2212 p0 q 3 .\n3\n27\n\n(7.6)\n\nIn general, the sign of I4 is related to the supersymmetry properties of the only two classes of extremal\nBH attractors [1] exhibited by the t3 model: namely, I4 > 0 and I4 < 0 for 12 -BPS and non-BPS\nZH 6= 0 attractor solutions, respectively (see e.g. Appendix II of [23]). The t3 model has been the first\nsupergravity model whose Attractor Eqs. have been completely solved. The BPS attractor solution\nwere known after [41, 49], and in [57] also the non-BPS ZH 6= 0 attractor solutions were completely\ndetermined (see also [58]). It is worth here pointing out that these results can also be obtained, through\na \" stu \u2192 st2 \u2192 t3 reduction\" procedure (see e.g. Sect. 5 of [42]), by performing the (near-)horizon\nlimit (\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) of the general expressions of the 21 -BPS and non-BPS ZH 6= 0 attractor flows5 of the\nstu model, obtained in full generality in [46] (see also Refs. therein, as well as [59]).\nNote that (7.6) can be obtained from the general formula (2.9) by specifying d111 = 6 and d111 =\n2/9, consistently with the non-linear relation (2.10).\nLet us now consider 2-center extremal BHs in the t3 model, with the charge vectors associated to\nthe two centers respectively reading\n\u0001T\nQ1 \u2261 p0 , p, q0 , q ;\n(7.7)\n\u0001\nT\nQ2 \u2261 P 0 , P, Q0 , Q .\n(7.8)\nBy working in the \"special coordinates\" symplectic frame, one can write down the components of the\n5 (spin s = 2) irrepr. of the horizontal symmetry SLh (2, R) by recalling Eqs.

To this end, one defines the rectangular 6 \u00d7 8\nJacobian matrix J (5.1), where I is defined by\nI \u2261 (I+2 , I+1 , I0 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W)\nand (\u03b1 = 1, ..., 8)\nQ\u03b1 \u2261 QT1 , QT2\n\n\u0001T\n\n= p0 , p, q0 , q, P 0 , P, Q0 , Q\n\n(7.14)\n\u0001T\n\n(7.15)\n\nis the charge vector spanning the 8-dimensional vector space (5.4), where Vi is the 4-dimensional\nirrepr. space of the 4 (spin s = 3/2) irrepr. of the U -duality group SL (2, R), in which the magnetic\nand electric charges of the BH at center i = 1, 2 sit.\nBy direct computation, one can check that the rank of the matrix J in the t3 model is five. Namely,\nall minors of rank six of J do vanish, whereas all minors of rank five are non-zero.\nSimilarly to the discussion done for the stu and st2 models, a simple venue for the explanation for\nthe rank five of J in the t3 model is as follows.\nThe whole vector space spanned by the charge vector Q\u03b1 (7.15) of the two BH centers in the t3\nmodel is given by the 8-dimensional space V defined in (5.4). On the other hand, the generic (BPS)\norbit of Q\u03b1 is given by O = SL (2, R) itself, and thus it is 3-dimensional. Thus, by applying the relation\n(1.2) to the st2 model, the final result on the number of polynomial invariants is Ip=2 = 8 \u2212 3 = 5,\nin agreement with the computations reported above. One can also check that (1.2) applied to the\n1-center case of t3 model trivially yields the correct result, namely Ip=1 = 4 \u2212 3 = 1 (i.e., the quartic\ninvariant (7.6) - in \"special coordinates\" basis or, equivalently (3.9) - in Calabi-Vesentini basis).\nThe above counting of independent 2-center polynomial invariants of the U -duality group SL (2, R)\nof the t3 model is consistent with the number of independent, manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial relations holding for the t3 model itself.\nBefore proceeding, it should be remarked that the irreducible (rank-1) t3 model is sui generis with\nrespect to the reducible stu (rank-3) and st2 (rank-2) models. Indeed, while the Calabi-Vesentini\n[44] T-tensor formalism introduced above can be applied to both the stu and st2 , it requires dome\nfurther modifications in order to be applied to the t3 model. This can essentially be traced back to\nthe fact that, while the stu and st2 models are the first two elements (n = 2 and n = 1, respectively)\nof the aforementioned N = 2 Jordan symmetric sequence, the t3 model is an isolated case within\nthe classification of homogeneous symmetric non-compact SK manifolds (see e.g. [48, 34], and Refs.\ntherein). As a consequence, the consistent application of the T-tensor (Calabi-Vesentini) formalism\nto the t3 model requires some ad hoc modifications (leading to a \"constrained\" Calabi-Vesentini\nsymplectic frame), which are derived and studied in App. B.\nAs we will detail in App. A, starting from the stu model and its constraint (5.6), a suitable\nreduction to the t3 model determines the following two manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant constraints\n(recall (4.2), (4.12) and (4.13)):\nX\nP8,t3\nand then (recall (6.12))\n\n1 2 1 2\nW = Tr (Ta ) ;\n4\n\u0001 4 4\n2\n\u2261 24 I6 W \u2212 12Tr I + W = 0,\n= 0 \u21d4 kTk2 =\n\nP16,t3 = 0.\n\n(7.16)\n(7.17)\n(7.18)\n\nNote that the constraints (6.10) and (7.18) can be seen as a quartic algebraic equation in W 2 , and\nit can be checked that only one real positive out of the four generally complex roots exists in the case,\nthus uniquely matching the square of the symplectic product of Q1 and Q2 .\nSince I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 and I\u22122 all reduce to I4 (Q), and W and X both vanish in the 1-center\nlimit 1 \u2261 2, it is immediate to check that all above constraints identically vanish in such a limit. Also\n15\n\n\fnotice that all above constraints gets greatly simplified when W = 0 (namely, for mutually local charge\nvectors Q1 and Q2 ).\nThe manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial constraints (7.16)-(7.18) make the counting of independent G4 -invariant polynomials perfectly consistent with the result and analysis presented above.\nNamely, in the t3 model, the eight SL (2, R)-invariant polynomials I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , W and\nI6 are constrained by the 4-degree, 8-degree and 16-degree relations respectively given by Eqs. (7.16),\n(7.17) and (7.18). Thus, the number of 2-center independent SL (2, R)-invariant polynomials in the\nt3 model is Ip=2 = 8 \u2212 3 = 5, in agreement with the result (both from Jacobian analysis and general\ncounting) discussed above.\n\n8\n\nExtension to SOhv (2, 2) Symmetry and the Gramian Matrix\n\nThe treatment given in previous Secs. relies on the fact that an SLh (2, R)-covariant basis is given by\nthe quintet I, and the two singlets W and X (respectively defined by (4.5), (4.12) and (4.13)). By\nusing such a basis, the following [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant set of polynomials can be constructed:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(8.1)\nW , X , Tr I2 , Tr I3 ,\ndeg=2\n\ndeg=4\n\ndeg=8\n\ndeg=12\n\nwhere the degree in charges has been indicated.\nHowever, a lower\ndegree [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant polynomial, namely I6 defined by (3.16),\u0001 is\n\u0001\nrelated to Tr I3 through the degree-12 polynomial constraints (5.6). Actually, if in (8.1) Tr I3 is\nreplaced by I6 , one obtains the following complete set of [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant, with \"minimal\"\ndegrees in charges (indicated by subscripts):\n\u0001\n(8.2)\nW , X , I6 , Tr I2 .\ndeg=2\n\ndeg=4\n\ndeg=6\n\ndeg=8\n\nThen, by the theory of invariant polynomials of classical Lie groups, one is guaranteed that any other\nhigher-order invariant is related to the lowest-degree invariants by an algebraic relation.\nAs given by Eqs. (8.12)-(8.15) below, the set (8.2) is naturally related to the symmetry\nC\n\nSOhv (2, 2) \u2261 SLh (2, R) \u00d7 SLv (2, R) \u223c SOhv (4, C) ,\n\n(8.3)\n\nwhich is the direct product of the \"horizontal\" group SLh (2, R) introduced in Sec. 4 and of the\nSLv (2, R) factor (the upperscript \"v\" stands for \"vertical\") in the d = 4 U -duality group G4 (characterising the three models stu, st2 and t3 treated above, as well as the whole infinite sequences\n(1.1) and (9.1); see Sec. 9). The last step in (8.3) denotes the isomorphism with the complex group\nC\n\nSO (4, C). In the following treatment, we will work with complex groups, thus SL (2, R) \u223c SL (2, C)\nC\n\nand SO (2, 2) \u223c SO (4, C) and, where denoted, we will then perform the suitable Wick rotation to get\nthe appropriate real form.\nIn order to highlight the relation between the set (8.2) and the symmetry group SOhv (4, C) defined\nin (8.3), it is convenient to introduce the 4 \u00d7 4 complex symmetric, manifestly SOhv (4, C)-covariant\nso-called Gramian matrix [60]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nz0 * z1 z0 * z2 z0 * z3\nz02\n\uf8ec z0 * z1\nz1 * z2 z1 * z3 \uf8f7\nz12\n\uf8f7,\nG\u2261\uf8ec\n(8.4)\n\uf8ed z0 * z2 z1 * z2\nz2 * z3 \uf8f8\nz22\nz0 * z3 z1 * z3 z2 * z3\nz32\nwhere\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nz0,\u039b\n\uf8ec z1,\u039b \uf8f7 1 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed z2,\u039b \uf8f8 \u2261 2 \uf8ed\nz3,\u039b\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n1\np\u039b\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0 \u2212i \u2212i 0 \uf8f7 \uf8ec q\u039b\n0\n1 \u22121 0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed P\u039b\n\u2212i 0\n0 +i\nQ\u039b\n16\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(8.5)\n\n\fand the squared norms, scalar products and index raising and lowering are defined through the suitable\nSO (2, n)-metrics \u03b7\u039b\u03a3 and \u03b7 \u039b\u03a3 (in N = 4 theory, SO (2, n) is replaced by SO (6, n); see Eq. (9.1)\nbelow).\nThen, by denoting the eigenvalues of G with \u03bbi (i = 1, ..., 4), the characteristic equation of G reads:\ndet (G \u2212 \u03bbI) =\n\n4\nY\ni=1\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbi ) = \u03bb4 + a\u03bb3 + b\u03bb2 + c\u03bb + d = 0.\n\n(8.6)\n\nAs proved in App. C, the characteristic equation can be used as a generating function for manifestly\nSOhv (4, C)-invariant polynomials.

As proved in App. C, such four polynomials form a complete\nbasis for the SOhv (2, 2)-invariant polynomials of the symmetric matrix G.\n17\n\n\f1. In the stu model (and in the N = 2 Jordan symmetric sequence for n > 3, as well as in the\nwhole N = 4 infinite sequence (9.1) for n > 0) there are no relations among the four eigenvalues\n\u03bbi 's (generally, G has rank 4).\n2. In the st2 model, since the charges can be arranged as an SLv (2, R)-doublet of SO (2, 1)-vectors,\nthe 4\u00d74 matrix G has non-maximal rank 3, and thus its determinant vanishes. From Eq. (8.10),\nthis yields the following degree-8 constraint:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u00032 4\n1\u0002\n1\nT r G2\n+ T r G3 T rG \u2212 T r G4 \u2212 T r G2 (T rG)2 = 0,\ndetG \u2261 d = 0 \u21d4 (T rG)4 +\n6\n2\n3\n(8.18)\nimplying the vanishing of one eigenvalue of G itself. Eq. (8.18) is an equivalent, manifestly\nSOhv (2, 2)-invariant re-writing of the degree-8 polynomial constraint (6.11), which can be used\nto eliminate \u0001e.g. the highest-degree [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant of the set (8.2), namely the 8degree Tr I2 , in terms of the other lower-degree invariants, thus reducing (8.2) to the following\nset of three:\nW , X , I6 .\n(8.19)\ndeg=2\n\ndeg=4\n\ndeg=6\n\nBy using results (8.12)-(8.15) and Eqs.

In the t3 model it further holds that (recall Eq.

Note that, as also\ndiscussed in Sec. 7, by eliminating I6 in terms of Tr I3 increases the degree in charges of the\nresulting polynomial constraints, from the degree-12 of (5.6) to the degree-16 of (6.10) and (6.12).\n\n9\n\nGeneralization to N = 2 Jordan Symmetric Sequence\nand N = 4 Theory\n\nTwo infinite sequences of d = 4 supergravity theories exhibit a factorised U -duality group and symmetric (vector multiplets') scalar manifold, namely the Jordan symmetric sequence (1.1) and the N = 4\n(generally matter-coupled [62, 63]) theory (n \u2208 N \u222a {0})\nN =4:\n\nSO (6, n)\nSL (2, R)\n\u00d7\n(R \u2295 \u03935,n\u22121 ) ,\nU (1)\nSO (6) \u00d7 SO (n)\n18\n\n(9.1)\n\n\fwhere (1.1) is usually referred to as Jordan symmetric sequence [35, 36], and the round brackets in\nthe right-hand sides denote the corresponding reducible degree-3 Euclidean Jordan algebras [35, 36].\nThe number nV of matter (vector) multiplets is given by n + 1 in (1.1) and by n in (9.1).\nThe stu and st2 models respectively are the second (n = 2) and the first (n = 1) elements of the\nsequence (1.1).\nThe result Ip=2 = 7 obtained for the stu model in Sec. 2 can be proved to hold for the N = 2\nJordan symmetric sequence (1.1) with n > 2, and for the N = 4 theory coupled to any number n \u2208 N\nof matter (vector) multiplets.\nIndeed, the p = 2-center \"large\" orbits with I4 (Q1 ) > 0, I4 (Q2 ) > 0 for the sequences (1.1) and\n(9.1) respectively read:\n\uf8f1\nn = 0, 1, 2 : SL (2, R) \u00d7 SO (2, n) , BPS (n = 0, 1, 2), non-BPS (n = 1, 2);\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nSO(2,n)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 n > 3 : SL (2, R) \u00d7 SO(n\u22122) , BPS, non-BPS;\n(9.2)\nR \u2295 \u03931,n\u22121 :\n\uf8f4\nSO(2,n)\n\uf8f4\nn\n>\n4\n:\nSL\n(2,\nR)\n\u00d7\n,\nnon-BPS;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nSO(1,n\u22123)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 n > 5 : SL (2, R) \u00d7 SO(2,n) , non-BPS;\nSO(2,n\u22124)\n\nR \u2295 \u03935,n\u22121\n\n\uf8f1\nn > 0 : SL (2, R) \u00d7\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn > 1 : SL (2, R) \u00d7\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n:\nn > 2 : SL (2, R) \u00d7\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn > 3 : SL (2, R) \u00d7\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 n > 4 : SL (2, R) \u00d7\n\nSO(6,n) 1\nSO(2,n) , 4 -BPS;\n\nSO(6,n)\n1\nSO(3,n\u22121) , 4 -BPS;\nSO(6,n)\n1\nSO(4,n\u22122) , 4 -BPS,\n\nnon-BPS;\n\nSO(6,n)\nSO(5,n\u22123) ,\n\nnon-BPS;\n\nSO(6,n)\nSO(6,n\u22124) ,\n\nnon-BPS;\n\n(9.3)\n\nBy comparing these results with their p = 1 counterparts [24, 25, 28], one can realize that the 2-center\nstabilizer is always contained into the 1-center stabiliser with corresponding supersymmetry-preserving\nproperties. Furthermore, the first line of (9.2) summarizes the results of Sects. 2-7 on the stu model\n(n = 2) and its rank-2 and rank-3 descendants, namely the st2 model (n = 1) and the t3 model (n = 0).\nSince this latter does not belong to the Jordan symmetric sequence, but it is rather an isolated case in\nthe classification of symmetric special K\u00e4hler manifolds (see e.g. [34] and Refs. therein), the notation\nfor n = 0 in the first line of (9.2) is only of formal nature.\nThe various orbits of (9.2) and (9.3) can be related to the possible choices of signs of the four\neigenvalues \u03bb1 ,...,\u03bb4 of the Gramian matrix G introduced in Sect. 8.\nMoreover, (9.2) and (9.3) yield that the N = 2 BPS orbit with n = 6 matches the N = 4 non-BPS\norbit with n = 2, as well as the N = 2 non-BPS orbit with n = 6 matches the N = 4 41 -BPS orbit\nwith n = 2. This can be traced back to the fact that the corresponding theories share the very same\nbosonic sector [64].\nFurthermore, it is worth remarking that the n = 0 case of the N = 2 Jordan symmetric sequence\n(1.1) is nothing but the N = 2 axion-dilaton model (truncation of the \"pure\" N = 4 supergravity\ntheory [33]), whose 2-center split flow and marginal stability have been recently studied (in a manifestly\nU (1, 1)-covariant symplectic frame) in [37].\nRemarkably, the general formulae (1.2)-(1.3) yield that the number of independent G4 -invariant\n\n19\n\n\fpolynomials in both reducible sequences (1.1) and (9.1) is n-independent and it amounts to Ip=2 = 7 :\n(2 + n) (1 + n) (n \u2212 2) (n \u2212 3)\n+\n= 7; (9.4)\n2\n2\n(6 + n) (5 + n) (n + 2) (n + 1)\n= 4 (6 + n) \u2212 3 \u2212\n+\n= 7.

As mentioned above, the further reduction of the constraint (5.6) to the st2 and t3 models\ngive rise to an hierarchy of manifestly SLh (2, R)-invariant polynomial relations among the various\nG4 -invariant polynomials for these models.\nWe work in the \"special coordinates\" symplectic frame. In order to highlight the actual dependence\nof the G4 -invariant polynomials on the charges Q1 and Q2 themselves, we start and define some charge\nvariables invariant under the SO (1, 1) rescaling symmetry of G4 [34]. Indeed, by recalling that the\ncomponents of Q1 and Q2 have the following SO (1, 1)-weights (i = 1, 2, 3):\nSO (1, 1) : +3 +1 \u22123 \u22121\nQ1 =\n(p0 , pi , q0 , qi );\n\nSO (1, 1) : +3 +1 \u22123 \u22121\nQ2 =\n(P 0 , P i , Q0 , Qi ),\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\none can define\nx \u2261 q 1 p1 , y \u2261 q 2 p2 , z \u2261 q 3 p3 , r \u2261 q 0 p0 ,\n\nX \u2261 Q1 P 1 , Y \u2261 Q2 P 2 , Z \u2261 Q3 P 3 , R \u2261 Q0 P 0 ,\nZ1 \u2261 Q0 P 1 P 2 P 3 , z1 \u2261 q0 p1 p2 p3 ,\np2\np3\nq0\n, u2 \u2261 2 , u3 \u2261 3 .\nu\u2261\nQ0\nP\nP\n\n(A.3)\n\nIt can be explicitly shown that the eight polynomial [SL (2, R)]3 -invariants I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 ,\nI6 and W of the stu model can be re-written only in terms of the thirteen SO (1, 1)-invariant charge\nvariables defined by (A.3).\n20\n\n\fAs stated at the start of Sec. 5, all minors of order 8 of the relevant Jacobian matrix J defined\nby (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) do vanish. On the other hand, all minors of order 7 are non-zero. This is a\ncompelling evidence that the number of independent [SL (2, R)]3 -invariant polynomials is seven.\nThus, a (polynomial) relation constraining the aforementioned eight invariants is expected to exist.\nIn order to derive it, it is convenient to work in a particularly simple charge configuration, in which\nsome of the SO (1, 1)-invariant charge variables (A.3) vanish; namely:\np1 = q1 = p2 = q2 = p3 = q3 = 0 \u21d2 x = z = y = z1 = u2 = u3 =\n\nxyz\nz1\nz1\n=\n=\n= 0.\nz1\nu2\nu3\n\n(A.4)\n\nThis implies the extremal BH at center 1 to be non-BPS ZH 6= 0 (i.e. I+2 < 0), thus resulting in\np\nr = \u2212I+2 .\n(A.5)\n\nClearly, these choices imply some loss in generality, but remarkably, as we will see below, the results\nachieved within such a configuration actually hold for a completely generic 2-center charge configuration.\nBy plugging (A.4) and (A.5) into the expressions of I+2 , I+1 , I\u2032 , I\u2032\u2032 , I\u22121 , I\u22122 , I6 and W of the stu\nmodel, one can solve the resulting algebraic Eqs. for X, Y, u, R and Z1 as follows:\nu =\n\n2I+2\np\n,\n2I+1 + W \u2212I+2\n\nR=\n\n4I2+1 + I+2 W 2\n,\n4(\u2212I+2 )3/2\n\n\u0001\nI+2 I\u2032\u2032 \u2212 I2+1\n4I2+1 + I+2 W 2 \u2212 4I\u2032\n,\nY\n=\n2\n\u2212 Z,\nX = \u2212\n4(\u2212I+2 )3/2\n(\u2212I+2 )3/2\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011i\np\n1 n 4\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n2I\nI\n+\nW\nI\n+\nI\nZ1 =\n8I\n+\nI\n\u2212I\n\u2212\nI\nW\n\u22121\n+1\n6\n\u22121\n+2\n+1\n+2\n8I3+2\nh p\np\n\u0001io\n.\n\u2212I+2 I\u22121 2I6 \u2212I+2 + I\u2032 W \u2212I+2 + I+1 2I\u2032 + 4I\u2032\u2032 \u2212 W 2\n\n(A.6)\n\n(A.7)\n\nBy so doing, one ends up with following equation for the remaining charge variable Z :\n2\n\nZ =\n\n1\n4(I+2 )3\n\n\b\n\n4I4+1\n\n\u2212\n\nI\u22122 I3+2\n\n\u2212\n\n8I+2 I\u2032\u2032 I2+1\n\n+\n\nI2+2\n\n\u0002\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 2\n\n(I \u2212 2I ) + 4I+1 I\u22121 + 2I6 W\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0001\nI+2 I\u2032\u2032 \u2212 I2+1 Z\n,\n+2\n(\u2212I+2 )3/2\n(A.8)\n\nand self-consistency condition given by Eq. (5.6).\nRemarkably, when relaxing the conditions (A.4)-(A.5), one can check by direct calculation that Eq.\n(5.6) holds for a completely general 2-center charge configuration.\nIn order to reduce the stu model to the st2 model, the following identifications of charges are to be\nperformed (within the positions (A.4)-(A.5)):\nP 3 = P 2 \u2261 P 2,\n\nQ3 = Q2 \u2261\n\nQ2\n.\n2\n\n(A.9)\n\nThis implies Y = Z, where (A.6) implies\nY=Z=\n\nI+2 I\u2032\u2032 \u2212 I2+1\n.\n(\u2212I+2 )3/2\n\n(A.10)\n\nBy inserting (A.10) into (A.8), the result (6.11) is achieved. By plugging this latter back into (5.6),\nthe 16-degree constraint (6.10)-(6.12) is obtained.\nOn the other hand, the reduction of the stu model down to the t3 model entails the following charge\nidentifications:\nQ\n(A.11)\nP 3 = P 2 = P 1 \u2261 P, Q3 = Q2 = Q1 \u2261 .\n3\n21\n\n\fThese latter imply X = Y = Z, and Eqs. (A.6)-(A.7) thus yield Eq. (7.16). This latter, inserted into\nEqs. (6.11) and (6.10), respectively gives (7.17) and (7.18).\nOnce again, all above results can be checked to hold in a general 2-charge configuration, and\ntherefore they are completely general.\nThis analysis relates a \"minimal\" set of BH charges to the \"minimal\" number of independent\nG4 -invariant polynomials discussed in the present paper (see in particular Sec. 5).\nFinally, the action of the d = 4 U -duality group G4 on the charge vectors Q1 and Q2 can be\nsummarised as follows:\n1. In the rank-3 stu model (G4 = [SL (2, R)]3 ) there are 7 independent polynomial G4 -invariants\ndepending on the 13 SO (1, 1)-invariant combinations. Thus, out of the 16 charges composing\nthe charge vector Q\u03b1 defined in (5.3), 6 charges can be set to zero by the action of the noni3\nh\n(namely, one conformal boost and one\ndilatational 6 generators of G4 , spanning SL(2,R)\nSO(1,1)\ntranslational generator for each of the three SL(2,R)\nSO(1,1) factors). By recalling the definitions (A.3)\nof the SO (1, 1)-invariant charge variables, a representative of a \"minimal\" charge configuration\nis e.g. given by\nQ1\nQ2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013T\nr\nz1\nuZ1\nxZ1 uu2 u3\n1 2 3\n1\n2\n3\n=\n;\nP P P ,\nP , u2 P , u3 P , 1 2 3 ,\n, 0, 0\nuZ1\nZ1 uu2 u3\nP P P\nz1 P 1\n\u0012\n\u0013T\nZ1\n1\n2\n3\n,\n(A.12)\n=\n0, P , P , P , 1 2 3 , 0, 0, 0\nP P P\n\nwith Z1 > 0 \u21d2 I4 (Q2 ) > 0, and I4 (Q1 ) > 0. In (A.12) P 1 , P 2 , P 3 \u2208 R+\n0 are the parameters of\nthe three SO(1, 1) (generated by the three non-compact Cartan generators of G4 = [SL (2, R)]3 ).\n2. In the rank-2 st2 model (G4 = [SL (2, R)]2 ) there are 6 independent polynomial G4 -invariants\ndepending on the 10 SO (1, 1)-invariant combinations. Thus, out of the 12 charges composing\nthe charge vector Q\u03b1 defined in (6.9), 4 charges can be set to zero by the action of the noni2\nh\n(namely, one conformal boost and one\ndilatational 4 generators of G4 , spanning SL(2,R)\nSO(1,1)\ntranslational generator for each of the two SL(2,R)\nSO(1,1) factors). By recalling the definitions (A.3) of\nthe SO (1, 1)-invariant charge variables, a representative of a \"minimal\" charge configuration is\ne.g. given by\nQ1\nQ2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013T\n\u0001\nuZ1\nxZ1 uu22\nr\nz1\n1\n2\n1\n2 2\nP , u2 P ,\n,\n=\n;\nP P\n,\n,0\nuZ1\nZ1 uu22\nP 1 (P 2 )2 z1 P 1\n\u0013T\n\u0012\nZ1\n1\n2\n,\n, 0, 0\n=\n0, P , P ,\nP 1 (P 2 )2\n\n(A.13)\n\nwith Z1 > 0 \u21d2 I4 (Q2 ) > 0, and I4 (Q1 ) > 0. In (A.13) P 1 , P 2 \u2208 R+\n0 are the parameters of the\ntwo SO(1, 1) (generated by the two non-compact Cartan generators of G4 = [SL (2, R)]2 ).\n3. In the rank-1 irreducible t3 model (G4 = SL (2, R)) there are 5 independent polynomial G4 invariants depending on the 7 SO (1, 1)-invariant combinations. Thus, out of the 8 charges\ncomposing the charge vector Q\u03b1 defined in (7.15), 2 charges can be set to zero by the action\nof the non-dilatational 2 generators of G4 , spanning SL(2,R)\nSO(1,1) (namely, one conformal boost and\none translational generator). By recalling the definitions (A.3) of the SO (1, 1)-invariant charge\n\n22\n\n\fvariables, a representative of a \"minimal\" charge configuration is e.g. given by\nQ1\nQ2\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nuZ1\nx\n(P )3 , u2 P,\n=\n,3\n3\nuZ1\nu2 P\n(P )\n\u0013T\n\u0012\nZ1\n,\n,0\n=\n0, P,\n(P )3\n\n\u0013T\n\n;\n(A.14)\n\nwith Z1 > 0 \u21d2 I4 (Q2 ) > 0, and I4 (Q1 ) > 0. In (A.14) P \u2208 R+\n0 is the parameter of the SO(1, 1)\ngenerated by the non-compact Cartan generator of G4 = SL (2, R).\n\nB\n\nConstrained Calabi-Vesentini Basis for t3 Model\n\nAs mentioned in Sec. 7, the application of the Calabi-Vesentini [43, 44] T-tensor formalism to the t3\nmodel deserves a separate treatment, which we are going detail in the present Appendix.\nIn order to deal with this, let us start and recall some basic facts on the Calabi-Vesentini (CV)\nbasis of N = 2, d = 4 Jordan symmetric sequence. In particular, let us consider the stu model,\nwhose CV basis has been explicitly discussed also in [41].

Thus, every SO (n, R)-invariant\npolynomial P (A) of a real symmetric n\u00d7n matrix A is also a polynomial in {\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn }; its SO (n, R)invariance implies10 that it is symmetric under even permutations of the indices {1, ..., n}. Furthermore, such a polynomial in {\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn } can be split into a symmetric component and into an antisymmetric component under odd permutations of the indices {1, ..., n}:\n\u2022 the symmetric component is given by P (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ), a polynomial which is symmetric under all\npermutations of indices {\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn }. Its functional dependence on the eigenvalues {\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn }\ncan be proved to be as follows (see e.g. [68]):\n!\nX p\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne \u03c3p \u2261\n\u03bb , 1 6 p 6 n = Q TrA, Tr A2 , ..., Tr (An ) .\nP (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) = P\n(C.2)\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2022 the anti-symmetric component is of the form (recall (C.2); see e.g. [68])\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP\u2032 (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) \u2206 (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) = Q\u2032 TrA, Tr A2 , ..., Tr (An ) \u2206 (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) ,\nwhere\n\n8\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 \u03bb1\nY\n\uf8ec 1 \u03bb2\n\u2206 (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) \u2261\n(\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbi ) = det \uf8ec\n\uf8ed ... ...\n16i<j6n\n1 \u03bbn\n\n\uf8f6\n.... \u03bb1n\u22121\n.... \u03bb2n\u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n....\n... \uf8f8\n.... \u03bbnn\u22121\n\n(C.3)\n\n(C.4)\n\nFor p > n, Tr(Ap ) can be expressed in terms of {T r (Ap )}16p6n since, by virtue of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem,\nA fulfills its characteristic equation det(\u03bbIn \u2212 A) = 0 (In denoting the n \u00d7 n identity).\n9\nWe thank Prof. Michel Dubois Violette for this argument.\n10\nIndeed, an even permutation of the indices {1, ..., n} can be represented by a suitable transformation of SO (n, R).\n\n26\n\n\fis the Vandermonde determinant. It should be remarked that \u2206 is not a polynomial in A,\nbecause it is a square root of the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial det(\u03bbIn \u2212 A).\nIndeed, in general the transformation t \u2208 SO (n, R) which diagonalizes A is not a polynomial in\nA itself, because, due to orthonormalisation of the eigenvectors of A, it involves square roots.\nTherefore, since we restrict to consider SO (n, R)-invariant polynomials in the real symmetric matrix\nA, the observations above lead to the conclusion that such polynomials necessarily are of the form\n(C.2). The analytic continuation of this result to C yields the proof of (C.1).\nThus, as mentioned in Sec. 8, by means of Newton's formulae [61] (cfr. Eqs. (8.7)-(8.10) in the\ncase n = 4), the characteristic polynomial det(\u03bbIn \u2212 A) can be considered as a generating function\nfor the ring of SO (n, C)-invariant polynomials of A = AT \u2208 Mn (C). \u0004\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
