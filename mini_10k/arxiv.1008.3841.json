Among these we quote the\nanalysis of space-like embedded hypersurfaces (submanifolds of co-dimension 1) fulfilling certain\ngeometric requirements. These requirements have been mostly inspired by the analysis the constraint equations which arise from the orthogonal splitting of the Einstein field equations. These\nequations adopt a simpler form if one makes assumptions on the extrinsic curvature and it is\ntherefore necessary to ensure that the corresponding assumptions can be made. The most common assumptions are to impose that the extrinsic curvature vanishes or has zero trace and this\nnaturally leads to the question about the existence of embedded hypersurfaces possessing these\nproperties. When the extrinsic curvature vanishes then the hypersurface is totally geodesic. The\nset of points which are invariant under a time-reflexion isometry with respect to a given time\nfunction forms a space-like hypersurface with vanishing extrinsic curvature and for that reason\none uses the nomenclature \"time-symmetric\" for these hypersurfaces.\nIn [11] all the foliations of the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time whose leaves are spherically\nsymmetric maximal hypersurfaces were found. This work was later generalised to the case in\nwhich the extrinsic curvature trace is a constant [4]. Examples of these foliations can be found\nin [9, 1]. A maximal slicing of a subset of the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time containing a\nCauchy hypersurface was constructed in [2] and the implications in numerical simulations were\naddressed. A different kind of hypersurfaces were considered in [8] where spherically symmetric\nhypersurfaces having constant scalar curvature were constructed. Yet another kind of foliation\nis that composed by hypersurfaces whose leaves have vanishing Riemann tensor (flat foliations).\nThe uniqueness of these foliations in static spherically symmetric spacetimes was addressed in [3]\nand explicit examples were constructed in the Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solutions,\n[10] and in the Kottler-Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, [12].\nIn this note we study embedded, time-symmetric hypersurfaces in the maximal extended\nSchwarzschild-Kruskal space-time. The most trivial example of such a hypersurface is comprised\nby any integral hypersurface of the static Killing vector but no other instance of such a hypersurface is known. A natural question is whether these hypersurfaces are indeed the only embedded\ntime-symmetric hypersurfaces which exist in the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time. We believe\nthat the answer to this question is affirmative but so far a complete proof of this issue is lacking.\nHowever, one can show other interesting properties of embedded time-symmetric hypersurfaces\n\u2217 E-mail\n\nadress: alfonso@math.uminho.pt\n\n1\n\n\fin the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time. It is the aim of the present short note to show that\nany embedded time-symmetric hypersurface in the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time cannot intersect the black hole region. To the best of our knowledge, a rigorous proof of this statement is\nnot available in the literature. A consequence of this result is that in the Schwarzschild geometry,\nall inextensible time-symmetric hypersurfaces embedded in the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time\nshould intersect the bifurcation sphere (see corollary 1).\nThe outline of this work is as follows: in section 2 we summarise some known results about the\nSchwarzschild solution which are needed in this work. Section 3 contains the main results of this\nwork which are the non-existence of embedded time-symmetric hypersurfaces in the non-static\nregions of the Schwarzschild space-time (proposition 1) and its corollary. Finally, we discuss some\napplications in section 4.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nThe maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry is the well-known Schwarzschild Kruskal\nspace-time [7] and this is what will be understood in this work by the Schwarzschild space-time.\nThis is a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold, which we shall denote by M with Lorentzian\nmetric gab (small Latin letters a, b, c, . . . will be used to denote indices for tensors fields on any\ntensor bundle built from T (M) and its dual T \u2217 (M)). The global causal structure of the Kruskal\nmaximal extension is well-known and it is displayed in figure 1 where the different regions of this\nspace-time are represented.\n~ be the unit timeNow let \u03a3 \u2282 M be a C k , k > 2 embedded space-like submanifold and let N\n~ ,N\n~ ) = \u22121). Unless otherwise\nlike normal vector to \u03a3 (our signature convention is such that g(N\nstated, all hypersurfaces considered in this work will be space-like. The first fundamental form\nh\u03b1\u03b2 and the extrinsic curvature K\u03b1\u03b2 are defined by the standard formulae\nh\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 g(~e\u03b1 , ~e\u03b2 ) ,\n\n~ ),\nK\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 g(~e\u03b2 , \u2207~e\u03b1 N\n\n(1)\n\nwhere {~e\u03b1 }, \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 is an arbitrary frame on \u03a3 and \u2207 represents the Levi-Civita connection\non M. As is well-known the first fundamental form and the extrinsic curvature can be regarded\nas symmetric tensor fields on \u03a3 (indices for tensor fields on any tensor bundle with \u03a3 as the base\nmanifold will be denoted with Greek characters \u03b1, \u03b2, . . . ). The pair (\u03a3, h\u03b1\u03b2 ) is a Riemannian\nmanifold and therefore one can introduce the Levi Civita connection D\u03b3 of the Riemannian\nmetric h\u03b1\u03b2 . An embedded hypersurface \u03a3 is said to be inextensible if it is not a proper subset of\nanother embedded hypersurface in \u03a3. When the extrinsic curvature is zero on every point of \u03a3\nthen we say that it is a time-symmetric hypersurface.\nThe Schwarzschild space-time can be characterised locally in terms of scalar and tensor concomitants of the Weyl tensor Wabcd [5]. Since some of the conditions arising from this characterisation are required later on, we review next its main aspects. First of all let us define the\ntensor\nGabcd \u2261 g ac g bd \u2212 g ad g bc .\n(2)\nThe tensor Gabcd has algebraic properties similar to those of the Riemann tensor.

We assume the reader familiar with the main features of these regions.\nTheorem 1 (Ferrando & S\u00e1ez, (1998)).

Let \u03a3 \u2282 M be an embedded C k , k > 2 hypersurface and assume further that \u03a3\nis time-symmetric. Then \u03a3 does not intersect the interior of the black hole region of the Kruskal\nmaximal extension.\nProof. Define a one-parameter family of embedded C k space-like hypersurfaces {\u03a3t }t\u2208I , where\nI is an open real interval, \u03a3t1 \u2229 \u03a3t2 = \u2205 if t1 6= t2 and \u03a30 = \u03a3. The family {\u03a3t } can then be\nregarded as a foliation of the set U \u2261 \u222at\u2208I \u03a3t . The unit timelike normal to each leave \u03a3t is a C k\nvector field on int(U) and we shall denote this vector field by na . We take now the conditions (5)\nand compute their orthogonal splitting with respect to the vector field na . Such a computation\nwas carried out in [6] and we shall only quote here the result which we need, referring the reader\nto the afore-mentioned reference for a complete derivation. The needed result is the orthogonal\nsplitting of the gradient of the scalar \u03c1 which reads\n\u2207a \u03c1 = P na + Pa ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u0001\n1\n1 dc\nP \u2261 \u2212 E ab Kab \u2212 \u03c1K aa \u2212\n\u01eb a E ab Dc Bbd + B ab Dc Ebd ,\n2\n6\u03c1\n1\nPc \u2261\n(\u2212B ab Dc Bab + E ab Dc Eab ) = Dc \u03c1,\n6\u03c1\n3\n\n(7a)\n(7b)\n\n\fand\n1\n\u01ebabc \u2261 \u03b7dabc nd ,\nKab \u2261 \u2212 Ln\n~ hab ,\n2\n\u2217\n\u2261 Wacbd nc nd , Bab \u2261 Wacbd\nnc nd .\n\nhab \u2261 gab + na nb ,\n\n(8)\n\nEab\n\n(9)\na ...a\n\nThe operator Dc appearing in some of the previous equations is defined for any tensor field T b11 ...bpq\nby\ns\na\na ...a\np\n(10)\nDc T b11 ...bpq \u2261 ha1 d1 . . . h p dp hs1 b1 . . . h q bq hlc \u2207l T ds11...d\n...sq .\nFrom (6) we easily deduce\n\u2207a \u03c1\u2207a \u03c1 = \u2212P 2 + Pa P a .\n\n(11)\n\nWe realise that P and Pc are given in terms of spatial quantities (quantities invariant under the\naction of the spatial projection hab ) and that makes it easy to compute the pull-back of them to\nany of the hypersurfaces \u03a3t under the inclusion embedding i : \u03a3t \u2282 M. In particular the pullback of hab (Kab ) under this embedding is the first fundamental form (the extrinsic curvature) of\n(t)\n(t)\n\u03a3t which is denoted by h\u03b1\u03b2 (K\u03b1\u03b2 ). Also, the pull-backs of Eab , Bab can be rendered in the form\n(see again [6])\n(t)\n\n(t)\n\nE\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 r\u03b1\u03b2 + K\n\n(t)\n(t)\u03b3\n\u03b3 K\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(t)\n\u2212 K\u03b1\u03b3\nK\n\n(t)\u03b3\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(t)\n\n(t) \u03b3\u03b4\n\nB\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u01eb(\u03b1\n\n(t)\n\n(t)\n\nD|\u03b3 K\u03b4|\u03b2) ,\n\n(12)\n\n(t)\n\nwhere r\u03b1\u03b2 is the Ricci tensor computed from the curvature arising from the covariant derivative\n(t)\n\nD\u03b1 (we follow the convention of adding the superscript t to those quantities intrinsic to the\n(t)\n(0)\nRiemannian manifold (\u03a3t , h\u03b1\u03b2 )). Now, by assumption, we have K\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 which entails, via (12),\n(0)\n\nB\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. Hence from (7a) we get P |\u03a3 = 0 and thus\n\u2207a \u03c1\u2207a \u03c1|\u03a3 \u2265 0.\n\n(13)\n\nWe can now compute the explicit value of the scalar \u2207a \u03c1\u2207a \u03c1 at any point of the Schwarzschild\nspace-time if we choose a coordinate representation. For example, we may choose the standard\nSchwarzschild coordinates\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2M\ndr2\n\u0001 + r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) , 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 , 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0, (14)\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212\ndt2 +\nr\n1 \u2212 2M\nr\n\nwhere M is the Schwarzschild mass. As is very well-known when r > 2M the Schwarzschild\ncoordinates cover either of the two asymptotically flat exterior regions D1 and D2 whereas for\n0 < r < 2M the coordinates cover either of the two interior regions B + or B \u2212 . In the Schwarzschild\ncoordinates one has\n9M 2 (2M \u2212 r)\n\u2207a \u03c1\u2207a \u03c1 = \u2212\n.\n(15)\nr9\nNote that since the scalar \u2207a \u03c1\u2207a \u03c1 is an invariant quantity, the relation (15) gives its value at\nany point of the maximal extension M, including the region not covered by the Schwarzschild\ncoordinates (this region is comprised by the points such that r = 2M which correspond to the\nregion H+ \u222a H\u2212 ). Now, from (15) it is straightforward to see that in the interior of any of the\nblack hole regions the inequality \u2207a \u03c1\u2207a \u03c1 < 0 holds and combining this property with (13) the\nrequired result follows.\nCorollary 1. Any inextensible connected time-symmetric C k , k > 2 hypersurface \u03a3 embedded in\nthe Schwarzschild space-time must intersect the bifurcation sphere.\nProof. Proposition 1 implies that \u03a3 must be included in the complementary set of the interior of\nthe black hole regions, which is the set D1 \u222a D2 \u222a H+ \u222a H\u2212 . Moreover since \u03a3 is space-like and\ninextensible, the intersection of \u03a3 and the set (H+ \u222a H\u2212 )\\\u03a9 must be the empty set from which\nwe conclude that the intersection of \u03a3 and \u03a9 is never empty.\n\n4\n\n\fCorollary 2. A point in the event horizon, but not in the bifurcation sphere, never belongs to\nthe boundary of a connected, time-symmetric, analytic hypersurface \u03a3 embedded in any of the\nexterior regions of the Schwarzschild space-time.\nProof. Suppose the contrary and let \u03a3 \u2229 (H\\\u03a9) be non-empty, where H \u2261 H+ \u222a H\u2212 . Since \u03a3 is\nanalytic, we may construct an analytic extension \u03a3\u0303 of \u03a3 through the set \u03a3 \u2229 (H\\\u03a9) such that\n\u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303 \u2229 int(B) 6= \u2205, where B \u2261 B + \u222a B \u2212 . We should distinguish now two possibilities:\neither \u03a3\u0303 is space-like at every point or it contains a subset in which it is null. In the first case one\ncan define a symmetric tensor field K\u03b1\u03b2 on \u03a3\u0303 through Eq. (1) which by construction is analytic\nand vanishes in a proper open subset of \u03a3\u0303 which is impossible. In the second alternative we can\nstill use Eq. (1) to define an analytic symmetric tensor field K\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 at any point of \u03a3\u0303 if we remove\n~ . On those points belonging to \u03a3 is easy to check\nthe normalisation condition on the vector N\nthat the relation\nK\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03a8K\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n~ and \u03a8 is a certain\nholds, where K\u03b1\u03b2 is the tensor obtained with the normalisation condition on N\nscalar function. Since K\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 we get K\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 on \u03a3, which again is impossible for an analytic\ntensor on \u03a3\u0303.\n\n4\n\nApplications and conclusions\n\nIn this work we have shown that inextensible time-symmetric hypersurfaces embedded in the\nSchwarzschild-Kruskal space-time never intersect the black hole region and always intersect the\nbifurcation sphere. An interesting issue not solved in this work (nor, as far as we know, in any\nother place of the literature) deals with the uniqueness of embedded time-symmetric hypersurfaces in the Schwarzschild-Kruskal space-time. It is tempting to conjecture that the integral\nhypersurfaces of the static Killing vector are the only time-symmetric hypersurfaces and one expects that our techniques should contribute to settle this question. If this conjecture were true\nthen one could seek an uniqueness result of the Schwarzschild space-time formulated in terms of\nthe uniqueness in the existence of embedded time-symmetric hypersurfaces.\nAs mentioned in section 2 a time-symmetric hypersurface has been regarded as space-like by\ndefinition. However, the second fundamental form can be defined for any kind of hypersurface by\n~ need not be normalised) and therefore a logical question would be\nmeans of Eq. (1) (the vector N\nwhat would happen when arbitrary embedded hypersurfaces with vanishing second fundamental\n~ chosen). When\nform are considered (this condition is independent from the normalisation for N\nwe deal with a time-like hypersurface, then equations (6) and (7a)-(7b) adopt a similar form and\nthe quantity P does vanish if the second fundamental form is zero but Pa could still be time-like\nor space-like. Thus the sign of the right hand side of (11) is not determined in general and hence\nthe main argument used in the proof of proposition 1 is no longer valid. Therefore we would\nhave to consider the possibility in which the hypersurface has null regions and space-like regions.\nIn the null regions one does not have a well-defined orthogonal splitting with respect to the null\nvector orthogonal to the hypersurface and hence it is not possible to decompose \u2207a \u03c1 on these\nregions in the manner shown in eq. (6).\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. Juan Antonio Valiente Kroon for a careful reading of the manuscript and useful\ncomments and we also thank an anonymous referee for constructive criticism.
