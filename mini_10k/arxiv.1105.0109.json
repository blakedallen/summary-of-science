Introduction\nThe intrinsic curvature of a space-time in general relativity is a concept that contradicts our\nevery day experience of space and time. The necessary mathematical set of tools is difficult\nto learn and fairly abstract. To get some impression what a curved space-time means, is to\nstudy the behaviour of light rays and particles in free motion. In the geometric optics limit\nand for particles whose mass has no back-reaction on the curvature of space-time, light rays\nand particles in free motion can be represented by null and time-like geodesics, respectively.\nFor a first glimpse on how null and time-like geodesics behave, it may be sufficient to\nuse off-the-shelf/standard software like for example Maple, Mathematica, or Octave. All of\nthem could integrate the geodesic equation and show the geodesic as 2d- or 3d-plot. However,\nto explore the behaviour of geodesics, an interactive tool is indispensable.\nIn this article we present the GeodesicViewer [1], an interactive tool to thoroughly\nexamine the behaviour of light-like and time-like geodesics in a space-time whose metric\n\u2021 and: Centre of Mathematics for Applications, University of Oslo, P.O.

The database of metrics is taken from the Motion4D library [2]. The\nmetrics with the corresponding Christoffel symbols and local tetrads are detailed in Ref. [3].\nThe graphical user interface, see Fig. 1, is written using the object-oriented, cross-platform\napplication framework Qt[4]. The graphical 2D and 3D output is realized by means of the\nOpen Graphics Library (OpenGL)[5]. For the numerical integration of the geodesics, we use\na standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the integrators of the GNU Scientific Library\n(GSL)[6].\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2 we give a short description of the\nGeodesicViewer. Sec. 3 discusses the standard situations in the Schwarzschild space-time.\nPeriodic orbits of time-like geodesics in black hole space-times are worked out in Sec. 4.\nSecs. 5 and 6 deal with the more exotic space-times like the Morris-Thorne wormhole and the\nextreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m diblack hole.\nThe GeodesicViewer is freely available for Linux and Windows. The source code and\nseveral examples can be downloaded from www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/relativity.\n2. GeodesicViewer\nThe two main outputs of the GeodesicViewer are 3D and 2D representations of the geodesic\ndata. In the standard 3D representation, a geodesic is depicted by means of pseudo-Cartesian\ncoordinates, where the inherent coordinates are transformed into Cartesian coordinates as\nusual. If an embedding diagram is defined for a specific hypersurface of the space-time,\nthe geodesic can also be represented in this form. (In principle, the user can implement\nany representation he wants.) The standard 2D representation of a geodesic is also given\nin pseudo-Cartesian coordinates, where now only a specific hypersurface is used. Another\nrepresentation shows coordinate or velocity relations. For example, the radial coordinate\ncould be plotted against the affine parameter. A third representation follows from the EulerLagrangian formalism, where an effective potential can be defined. This representation is\nparticularly helpful to find bound orbits.\nThe numerous features of the GeodesicViewer are described by means of examples which\nare formulated as exercises. The mathematical explanations are directed to the teacher. The\n\n\f3\n\nStudying null and time-like geodesics in the classroom\n\nexercises can be made either from scratch or a configure file can be prepared in advance, so\nthat the student only has to change a few parameters. Each result description is accompanied\nby a configure file which holds the final result for reproduction in the GeodesicViewer. To\nfamiliarize oneself with the graphical user interface of the GeodesicViewer, there are several\nonline tutorials. These can be worked through either alone or with guidance from the teacher.\n3. Basic examples in the Schwarzschild space-time\nThe prime example of general relativity is the Schwarzschild metric which we will give here\nin isotropic coordinates x\u03bc = (t, x, y, z). The line element ds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0003\n\u03c1s 4 \u0002 2\n1 \u2212 \u03c1s /\u03c1 2 2 2\n2\nc dt + 1 +\ndx + dy2 + dz2 ,\n(1)\nds = \u2212\n1 + \u03c1s /\u03c1\n\u03c1\nwhere \u03c1 2 = x2 + y2 + z2 , \u03c1s = GM/(2c2 ) is the Schwarzschild radius, G is Newton's constant,\nM is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light. The transformation between\nthe usual Schwarzschild radial coordinate r and the isotropic radial coordinate \u03c1 is given\nby r = \u03c1 (1 + \u03c1s /\u03c1)2 . If M = 0, Eq. (1) simplifies to the Minkowski metric in Cartesian\ncoordinates.\nBecause of the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild space-time, we can restrict\ngeodesics to the xy-plane. Then, the geodesic equations read\n0 = t \u0308 + 2\u0393ttxt \u0307\u1e8b + 2\u0393ttyt \u0307\u1e8f,\n0\n0\n\n(2)\n\n= \u1e8d + \u0393ttx t \u03072 + \u0393xxx \u1e8b2 + 2\u0393xxy \u1e8b\u1e8f + \u0393xyy \u1e8f2 ,\n= \u00ff + \u0393tty t \u03072 + \u0393yxx \u1e8b2 + 2\u0393yxy \u1e8b\u1e8f + \u0393yyy \u1e8f2 ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwith the Christoffel symbols\n\u0393ttx =\n\n2c2 \u03c1 3 \u03c1s (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ) x\n\n(\u03c1 + \u03c1s )7\n2\u03c1s x\n,\n\u0393ttx = 3\n\u03c1 [1 \u2212 \u03c1s2 /\u03c1 2 ]\n\n,\n\n\u0393tty =\n\n2c2 \u03c1 3 \u03c1s (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ) y\n\n(\u03c1 + \u03c1s )7\n2\u03c1s y\n\u0393tty = 3\n,\n\u03c1 [1 \u2212 \u03c1s2 /\u03c1 2 ]\n2\u03c1s\nx\n\u0393xxx = \u0393yxy = \u2212\u0393xyy = \u2212 3\n,\n\u03c1 1 + \u03c1s /\u03c1\n2\u03c1s\ny\n\u0393yyy = \u2212\u0393yxx = \u0393xxy = \u2212 3\n.\n\u03c1 1 + \u03c1s /\u03c1\n\n,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nHere, a dot represents the derivative with respect to the affine parameter \u03bb , hence t \u0307 = dt/d\u03bb .\nTo integrate the geodesic equations, we need not only an initial position but also an\ninitial direction. For this purpose, we first introduce the local reference frame {e(i) }i=t,x,y,z of\n\u03bc\nan observer which defines a local Minkowskian system. The four base vectors e(i) = e(i) \u2202\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\nhave to fulfill the orthonormality condition g\u03bc\u03bd e(i) e\u03bd( j) = \u03b7(i)( j) with \u03b7(i)( j) = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nHere, the most convenient choice for the local reference frame is the one which is adapted to\nthe coordinates and the symmetries of the metric,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1s \u22122\n1 + \u03c1s /\u03c1 \u2202t\n,\ne(x) = 1 +\n\u2202x ,\n(9)\ne(t) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c1s /\u03c1 c\n\u03c1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1s \u22122\n\u03c1s \u22122\ne(y) = 1 +\n\u2202y ,\ne(z) = 1 +\n\u2202z .\n(10)\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n\f4\n\nStudying null and time-like geodesics in the classroom\n\ne(3)\nk\n\u03c7\n\u03be\n\ne(2)\n\ne(1)\nFigure 2. Initial direction k = k(i) e(i) with respect to the local reference frame of an observer.\n\nNow, an initial direction, k = k(i) e(i) \u2202\u03bc = k \u03bc \u2202\u03bc , of a null or a time-like geodesic can be defined\nwith respect to this local reference frame as shown in Fig. 2.\nFor a null geodesic we have k = e(0) + sin \u03c7 cos \u03be e(1) + sin \u03c7 sin \u03be e(2) + cos \u03c7e(3) . The\ninitial direction of a time-like geodesic, on the other hand, equals\nthe initial four-velocity\n\u0001\nk = u = \u03b3ce(0) + \u03b3\u03b2 c sin \u03c7 cos \u03be e(1) + sin \u03c7 sin \u03be e(2) + cos \u03c7e(3) , where \u03b2 = v/c is the initial\np\nvelocity v scaled by the speed of light, and \u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 . Because we restrict to geodesics\nin the xy-plane, we must set \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 . The geodesic equations can now be solved using the\ninitial position x\u03bc \u03bb =0 and the initial direction \u1e8b\u03bc \u03bb =0 = k \u03bc .\nThe numerical integration of the geodesics are accomplished by either a standard fourthorder Runge-Kutta method or by the integrators of the GNU Scientific Library. After each\nintegration step, the geodesic is tested if it still fulfills the constraint equation g\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = \u03bac2\nwith \u03ba = 0 for light-like and \u03ba = \u22121 for time-like geodesics. If this constraint is not fulfilled\nwithin a certain accuracy, the integration stops.\nFor the following examples, we set G = c = M = 1. In physical units, this means that\nG/c2 = 1 ls/M which equals one light second per mass unit M \u2248 2.03 \u00d7 105 M . Hence,\nM = 1 represents an object of 2.03 \u00d7 105 solar masses and distances are measured in light\nseconds.\n\u03bc\n\n3.1. Deflection of light\nIn the neighbourhood of a black hole, light rays are no longer straight lines but they are\ndeflected due to the curvature of space-time. The size of the deflection depends on how close\n\n\f5\n\nStudying null and time-like geodesics in the classroom\nthe light ray passes the black hole.\nExercise: Start the GeodesicViewer and select the Schwarzschild metric in\nisotropic coordinates (SchwarzschildIsotropic) in the \"Metric/Integrator/Constants\" window. Set the position of an observer in the \"Local Tetrad\" window\nto (t = 0, x = 6, y = 6, z = 0). With respect to his local reference frame, the\nobserver starts light rays in the negative y-direction, k = e(0) \u2212 e(2) . For that,\nset the direction angle \u03be = 180\u25e6 within the \"Geodesic\" window. Modify the\ninitial position y and describe the behaviour of the light rays. What is the closest\napproach where the light ray can still escape from the black hole?\nResult: Figure 3 shows light rays for several initial positions yi . The closer the\nlight ray passes the black hole the stronger the\u221arays are deflected. If the light ray\ncrosses the photon orbit, rpo = 23 rs (\u03c1po = (2 + 3)\u03c1s ), the light ray cannot escape\nfrom the black hole.\ny\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n\u03c1s\n\nx\n\nFigure 3. Light rays starting from x = 6, yi = {6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, 2} in the negative y-direction\nare deflected by the curved space-time close to the Schwarzschild black hole (black disk). The\ndashed circle represents the photon orbit which represents the limit of the closest approach for\nlight rays.\n\nConfigure file: defl of light.\nA detailed explanation of the configuration file can be found in Appendix A.\nIt could also be interesting to find the initial position y where the light ray approaches\nthe photon orbit asymptotically. Here, we have y \u2248 3.9508265. For that, however, it would\nbe better to change the numerical integration from the standard Runge-Kutta fourth order\nintegrator without step size control to the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator with step size\ncontrol and absolute error tolerance of \u03b5abs = 10\u221212 . Then, the constraint equation for the\nlight ray is fulfilled until the light ray reaches the horizon.\n3.2. Einstein ring\nIn the previous example, we have seen that for some specific initial positions y, the light ray\norbits the black hole and returns to the observer. Due to the symmetry of the Schwarzschild\nspace-time, this happens also for light rays which lie in a plane that is rotated around the\nconnecting axis between the observer and the black hole. As a result, the observer will see\n\n\f6\n\nStudying null and time-like geodesics in the classroom\n\nhimself as an Einstein ring around the black hole. However, there is not only one but an\narbitrary number of Einstein rings.\nOne method to find the geodesics that return to the observer would be to solve the\ngeodesic equations analytically, see e.g. M\u00fcller [7]. But this is extremely laborious even for\nthe more adequate spherical coordinates. Another possibility, known from solving ordinary\ndifferential equations, is the shooting method which we can be easily simulated using the\nGeodesicViewer and varying the initial direction \u03be .\nExercise: Start the GeodesicViewer and select the Schwarzschild metric in\nisotropic coordinates (SchwarzschildIsotropic) in the \"Metric/Integrator/Constants\" window. Set the position of an observer in the \"Local Tetrad\" window to\n(t = 0, x = 6, y = 6, z = 0). Find the initial directions \u03be of the light rays that orbit\nthe black hole once, twice, or thrice, cf. Fig. 4, before returning to the observer.\nobserver\n\ny\n\n\u03c1s\n\nx\n\nFigure 4. Light rays starting from the observer at (x = 6, y = 6) return to him after orbiting\nthe black hole once (solid line) or twice (dashed line). Hence, the observer will see himself as\nan Einstein ring of first or second order.\n\nResult: The initial directions \u03be with respect to the observer's local reference\nframe, cf. Fig. 2, read: \u03be1 = 195.668165\u25e6 , \u03be2 = 195.96490458\u25e6 , and \u03be3 =\n195.965451625\u25e6 .\nConfigure file: einstein ring 1,einstein ring 2,einstein ring 3.\nExercise: The situation is as before. But now, the observer sends out a flash\nof light and measures the time until the Einstein rings appear: \u03c41 \u2248 40.1480,\n\u03c42 \u2248 69.2052, \u03c43 \u2248 98.2203. What is the relation between proper time and\ncoordinate time? Switch to the 2D view and use the coordinate time 't' as abscissa\nand 'x' as ordinate.\nResult: From Fig. 5 we can read the light travel times ti for the light rays with\ninitial directions \u03be . The relation between the coordinate time ti and the proper\ntime \u03c4i for a fixed observer position is constant.\nConfigure file: light travel time.\nThis example could be also formulated for given observer positions \u03c1 and corresponding light\ntravel times \u03c4(\u03c1) as measured by the observer. To prepare this exercise, the coordinate times t\nfor one orbit have to be determined r\nin advance for several radial positions \u03c1.

Probably, this relation could be easier found\nin the standard spherical Schwarzschild coordinates.\n3.3. Shapiro time delay\nIn Ref.

A light ray emitted at xsource = \u2212X passes a spherical mass M, which is\nlocated at (x = 0, y = 0), at y = R and reaches\n\u221a the observer at xobs = X. From the isotropic\nmetric, Eq.

Find a geodesic that connects the observer, located at\nxobs = 200, with a light source at position xsource = \u2212200.

Periodic orbits of time-like geodesics in black hole space-times\nThe most simple periodic orbit of a time-like geodesic in the Schwarzschild space-time is a\ncircular orbit. The relation between the radius r of the orbit and the corresponding velocity \u03b2\ncan be easily found within the original, spherically symmetric Schwarzschild coordinates. In\nisotropic coordinates, this relation reads\nv \"\n#\nu\n\u00132\n\u0012\nu\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\ns\n\u22121\n\u22121 ,\n(12)\n1+\n\u03b2 = t2\n4\u03c1s\n\u03c1\n\u221a\nwhich is valid only down to the last stable orbit, \u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1lso = (5 + 2 6)\u03c1s . However, beside\nthese circular orbits, there are also more complex periodic orbits. Levin and Perez-Giz [9]\ngive a whole taxonomy of periodic orbits. See Appendix B on how to reproduce the orbits\nshown in their paper.\nIn the following exercise, we will consider periodic orbits for Kerr black holes. In BoyerLindquist coordinates, see e.g. Bardeen et al.

The observer\nis located at (r = 6, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = 0). With respect to his locally non-rotating\nreference frame, cf. 'Natural local tetrad' in the 'Local Tetrad' window, he starts\na future directed time-like geodesic with initial velocity \u03b2 = 1/2 and direction\n\u03c7 = 90\u25e6 , \u03be = 67.649\u25e6 , see Fig. 7. By varying the initial direction \u03be , find periodic\norbits of higher order.

Multi black hole solution\nInteresting general relativistic situations occur when several black holes are combined. These\nconfigurations will be inherently dynamical due to the mutual gravitational attraction between\nthe black holes. However, it is possible to construct static situations if one allows the black\nholes to carry an electric charge. Then the gravitational attraction can be compensated\nexactly by the electric repulsion. These solutions have been discovered by Majumdar [15]\nand Papapetrou [16]. They can be described as a collection of any number of extreme\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f8m black holes. We consider here the case of only two such black holes,\nsee Chandrasekhar [17],\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m metric reads\n\u0001\ndt 2\n(20)\nds2 = \u2212 2 +U 2 dx2 + dy2 + dz2 ,\nU\np\np\nwhere U = 1+M1 /r1 +M2 /r2 , r1 = x2 + y2 + (z \u2212 1)2 , and r2 = x2 + y2 + (z + 1)2 .

Summary and outlook\nThe GeodesicViewer is a valuable tool to study the behaviour of light-like and time-like\ngeodesics in space-times whose metrics are provided analytically. While geodesics could\nalso be visualized using standard software, a clear understanding of their behaviour can only\nbe achieved by interactively manipulating the corresponding parameters.\nIn this paper, we have given a small number of possible applications formulated as\nexercises for students in the classroom. This can only hint at various other possibilities.\nThe strength of GeodesicViewer lies in its visualization capabilities and to a large part in\nthe available database of exact solutions. This allows the user to study the behaviour of\n\n\fStudying null and time-like geodesics in the classroom\n\n12\n\ngeodesics in many different circumstances. The possibility to choose the curve parameters in\nan interactive way means that one can make numerous parameter studies depending on the\nproblem under consideration.\nSo far, the GeodesicViewer can only handle one geodesic at once. This limitation will be\novercome in a future version. We also plan to make the GeodesicViewer scriptable to realize\nmore complex demonstrations.\nAppendix A. Configuration file example for the GeodesicViewer\nAs an example, we give here the configuration file for the 'Deflection of light' exercise of\nSec. 3.1 as written by the GeodesicViewer.

The time-direction (TIME_DIR) can be either\nplus or minus one depending on the geodesic being future- or past-directed. The method\nfor solving the geodesic equation (GEOD_SOLVER_TYPE) is encoded by just a number, cf.\nm4dMotionList.h of the Motion4D library. The absolute and relative error tolerances are\ngiven by the EPSILONS values. The numerical integration of the geodesic stops when the\nconstraint equation with CONSTR_EPSILON is no longer fulfilled. For the local reference\nframe in this exercise, we use the default natural local tetrad. Hence, the TETRAD_TYPE is\nset to zero, the base vectors BASE_0 to BASE_3 build the identity matrix, and there is no boost\ntransformation (the last value is the boost velocity). Since we use geometrical units, the speed\nof light and the gravitational constant are set to unity.\n\n\fStudying null and time-like geodesics in the classroom\n\n13\n\nAppendix B.
