But the way\nDalits and those suppressed are being treated by\nthe people who wield power and authority speaks\nvolumes for the degradations of our moral\nstructure and civilized standards.\"\nEx-President of India, the late K. R. Narayanan\nThe New Indian Express, Saturday, 12 Nov. 2005\nK.R.Narayanan was a lauded hero and a distinguished\nvictim of his Dalit background. Even in an international\nplatform when he was on an official visit to Paris, the media\nheadlines blazed, 'An Untouchable at Elysee'. He was\nvisibly upset and it proved that a Dalit who rose up to such\nheights was never spared from the pangs of outcaste-ness\nand untouchability, which is based on birth. Thus, if the\nerstwhile first citizen of India faces such humiliation, what\nwill be the plight of the last man who is a Dalit?\nAs one of the world's largest socio-economically\noppressed,\nculturally\nsubjugated\nand\npolitically\nmarginalized group of people, the 138 million Dalits in\nIndia suffer not only from the excesses of the traditional\noppressor castes, but also from State Oppression- which\nincludes, but is not limited to, authoritarianism, police\nbrutality, economic embargo, criminalization of activists,\nelectoral violence, repressive laws that aim to curb\nfundamental rights, and the non-implementation of laws that\nsafeguard Dalit rights. The Dalits were considered\nuntouchable for thousands of years by the Hindu society\nuntil the Constitution of India officially abolished the\npractice of untouchability in 1950.\n\n6\n\n\fThe rigid rules of the caste system were codified in the\nManusmriti, a Hindu religious text which decreed that\nSudras and Dalits were to be distressed for subsistence. Max\nWeber, perhaps the most outstanding comparative\nsociologist of all time, clearly defined the social identity of\nthe Hindu in terms of caste, and of caste in terms of ritual.\n\"Caste, that is, the ritual rights and duties it gives and\nimposes, and the position of the Brahmins, is the\nfundamental institution of Hinduism. Before everything\nelse, without caste there is no Hindu.\"\nIn this book we have analyzed the diverse\nmanifestations of untouchability and the caste-system of\nHinduism using Fuzzy and Neutrosophic theory.\nIn studying untouchability, we have chosen to view it\nthrough the eyes of the relentless crusader, Periyar E. V.\nRamasamy (1879-1973). He was a social revolutionary who\nvociferously campaigned against untouchability and called\nfor the annihilation of the caste system. For six decades, he\npowerfully influenced the course of politics in the SouthIndian state of Tamil Nadu. His ideology and struggle to\nattain rationalism, caste-annihilation, self-respect and\nwomen liberation have made a permanent impact on the\nentire nation. Dr.K.Veeramani, who joined Periyar's\nmovement at 11 years of age in 1944, is today the President\nof the Dravidar Kazhagam. He works vigorously to spread\nthe revolutionary principles of his mentor and he has\nestablished numerous institutions as permanent memorials\nto Periyar.\nThe practices of untouchability and the caste system\nhave a devastating effect on the nation's progress. That is\nwhy, in order to understand the multi-dimensional facets of\nuntouchability and its consequences, we have given relevant\nexcerpts from the translation of Periyar's writings and\nspeeches.\nThis book is organized into four chapters.\nIn Chapter One we just introduce the basic Fuzzy and\nNeutrosophic tools used in the analysis of the social evil of\nUntouchability. Since the notion of caste is based on the\n\n7\n\n\fmind, it is appropriate to use Fuzzy and Neutrosophic\ntheory.\nIn Chapter Two we use the opinion of several experts to\nanalyze the various aspects of untouchability. Here, we use\nthe tools that have been described in Chapter One. Fuzzy\nDirected Graphs and Neutrosophic Directed Graphs of these\nFuzzy and Neutrosophic models happen to be very dense.\nWe have represented 16 such graphs in this book.\nIn Chapter Three we give a brief introduction about the\nlife and struggle of Periyar. We have provided more than\n220 pages of translations of his writings and speeches that\ndealt with the issues of caste and untouchability. In the final\nsection of this chapter, we have provided a compilation of\nthe various atrocities undergone by Dalits in present-day\nIndia.\nThe fourth and concluding chapter gives observations\ndrawn from our mathematical results based on the Fuzzy\nand Neutrosophic analysis.\nA list for further reading is also provided.\nA study of this kind is being carried out for the first\ntime. We have used mathematical tools to study this\nsociological problem because we wanted to perform a\nscientific study of this system of oppression.\nIn this book the terms Panchamas, Depressed\nClasses, Untouchables, Adi Dravidars, Paraiayar, Pallar,\nChakkiliyar refers to the Dalits. We have retained the\noriginal words in the translations.\nWe feel that it was our lifetime duty to render this\nservice to the great leader Periyar who devoted his entire\nlife to working for the rights of the subjugated people.\nW.B.VASANTHA KANDASAMY\nFLORENTIN SMARANDACHE\nK.KANDASAMY\n26-11-2005\n\n8\n\n\fChapter One\n\nBASIC NOTIONS OF\nFCMS, FRMS, NCMS AND NRMS\nThe main motivation of this chapter is to make the book a\nself contained one. In this chapter we just recall the basic\nconcepts of the fuzzy tools and the neutrosophic tools used\nin this book for analyzing the vision of Periyar on\nuntouchability. This chapter has six sections. In section one\nwe just recall the definition of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps\n(FCMs) and illustrate them with examples. Section two\ngives the properties and some models of FCM. Section three\ndescribes the notion of Fuzzy Relational Maps (FRMs). In\nsection four we introduce the concepts neutrosophy. Section\nfive gives the definition of Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps\n(NCMs) and some of its properties. In the final section we\ngive the definition of Neutrosophic Relational Maps\n(NRMs) and illustrate it by some models.\n1.1 Definition of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps\nIn this section we recall the notion of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps\n(FCMs), which was introduced by Bart Kosko [26] in the\nyear 1986. We also give several of its interrelated\ndefinitions. FCMs have a major role to play mainly when\nthe data under consideration is an unsupervised one. Further\nthis method is most simple and an effective one as it can\nanalyse the data by directed graphs and connection matrices\nand give the hidden pattern of the system. As we are more\ninterested to attract all types of reader we have not used\nvery high mathematics.\nDEFINITION 1.1.1: An FCM is a directed graph with\nconcepts like policies, events etc. as nodes and causalities\n\n9\n\n\fas edges. It represents causal relationship between\nconcepts.\nExample 1.1.1: In Tamil Nadu (a southern state in India) in\nthe last decade several new engineering colleges have been\napproved and started. The resultant increase in the\nproduction of engineering graduates in these years is\ndisproportionate with the need of engineering graduates.\nThis has resulted in thousands of unemployed and\nunderemployed graduate engineers. Using an expert's\nopinion we study the effect of such unemployed engineering\ngraduates in the society. An expert spells out the five major\nconcepts relating to the unemployed graduate engineers as\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nFrustration\nUnemployment\nIncrease of educated criminals\nUnder employment\nTaking up drugs etc.\n\nThe directed graph where E1, ..., E5 are taken as the nodes\nand causalities as edges as given by an expert is illustrated\nin the following Figure 1.1.1:\nE1\n\nE2\n\nE4\n\nE3\nE5\nFIGURE: 1.1.1\n\nAccording to this expert, increase in unemployment\nincreases frustration. Increase in unemployment, increases\nthe educated criminals. Frustration increases the graduates\nto take up to evils like alcohol drugs etc. Unemployment\nalso leads to the increase in number of persons who take up\nto drugs, drinks etc. to forget their worries and unoccupied\ntime. Under-employment forces them to do criminal acts\n\n10\n\n\flike theft (leading to murder) for want of more money and\nso on. Thus one cannot actually get data for this but can use\nthe expert's opinion for this unsupervised data to obtain\nsome idea about the real plight of the situation. This is just\nan illustration to show how FCM is described by a directed\ngraph. {If increase (or decrease) in one concept/node leads\nto increase (or decrease) in another concept/node, then we\ngive the value 1. If there exists no relation between two\nconcepts the value 0 is given. If increase (or decrease) in\none concept decreases (or increases) another, then we give\nthe value \u20131. Thus FCMs are described in this way.\nDEFINITION 1.1.2: When the nodes of the FCM are fuzzy\nsets then they are called as fuzzy nodes.\nDEFINITION 1.1.3: FCMs with edge weights or causalities\nfrom the set {\u20131, 0, 1} are called simple FCMs.\nDEFINITION 1.1.4: Consider the nodes / concepts C1, ..., Cn\nof the FCM. Suppose the directed graph is drawn using\nedge weight eij \u2208 {0, 1, \u20131}. The matrix E be defined by E =\n(eij) where eij is the weight of the directed edge Ci Cj . E is\ncalled the adjacency matrix of the FCM, also known as the\nconnection matrix of the FCM.\nIt is important to note that all matrices associated with an\nFCM are always square matrices with diagonal entries as\nzeros.\nDEFINITION 1.1.5: Let C1, C2, ... , Cn be the nodes of an\nFCM. A = (a1, a2, ... , an) where ai \u2208 {0, 1}. A is called the\ninstantaneous state vector and it denotes the ON - OFF\nposition of the node at an instant.\nai = 0 if ai is OFF and ai = 1 if ai is ON for i = 1, 2, ..., n.\nDEFINITION 1.1.6: Let C1, C2, ... , Cn be the nodes of an\nFCM. Let C1C 2 , C 2 C3 , C 3C 4 , ... , C i C j be the edges of\nthe FCM (i \u2260 j). Then the edges form a directed cycle. An\n\n11\n\n\fFCM is said to be cyclic if it possesses a directed cycle. An\nFCM is said to be acyclic if it does not possess any directed\ncycle.\nDEFINITION 1.1.7: An FCM with cycles is said to have a\nfeedback.\nDEFINITION 1.1.8: When there is a feedback in an FCM,\ni.e., when the causal relations flow through a cycle in a\nrevolutionary way, the FCM is called a dynamical system.\nDEFINITION 1.1.9: Let C1C 2 , C 2 C3 , ... , C n \u22121C n be a cycle.\nWhen Ci is switched on and if the causality flows through\nthe edges of a cycle and if it again causes Ci , we say that\nthe dynamical system goes round and round. This is true for\nany node Ci , for i = 1, 2, ... , n. The equilibrium state for\nthis dynamical system is called the hidden pattern.\nDEFINITION 1.1.10: If the equilibrium state of a dynamical\nsystem is a unique state vector, then it is called a fixed\npoint.\nExample 1.1.2: Consider a FCM with C1, C2, ..., Cn as\nnodes. For example let us start the dynamical system by\nswitching on C1. Let us assume that the FCM settles down\nwith C1 and Cn on i.e. the state vector remains as (1, 0, 0,\n..., 0, 1) this state vector (1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1) is called the\nfixed point.\nDEFINITION 1.1.11: If the FCM settles down with a state\nvector repeating in the form A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 ... \u2192 Ai \u2192 A1 then\nthis equilibrium is called a limit cycle.\nMethods of finding the hidden pattern are discussed in the\nsection 1.2.\nDEFINITION 1.1.12: Finite number of FCMs can be\ncombined together to produce the joint effect of all the\nFCMs. Let E1, E2, ..., Ep be the adjacency matrices of the\n12\n\n\fFCMs with nodes C1, C2, ..., Cn then the combined FCM is\ngot by adding all the adjacency matrices E1, E2, ..., Ep .\nWe denote the combined FCM adjacency matrix by E =\nE1 + E2 + ...+ Ep .\nNotation: Suppose A = (a1, ... , an) is a vector which is\npassed into a dynamical system E. Then AE = (a'1, ... , a'n)\nafter thresholding and updating the vector suppose we get\n(b1, ... , bn) we denote that by (a'1, a'2, ... , a'n) J (b1, b2,\n... , bn). Thus the symbol 'J' means the resultant vector has\nbeen thresholded and updated.\nFCMs have several advantages as well as some\ndisadvantages. The main advantage of this method is, it is\nsimple. It functions on expert's opinion. When the data\nhappens to be an unsupervised one the FCM comes handy.\nThis is the only known fuzzy technique that gives the\nhidden pattern of the situation. As we have a very well\nknown theory, which states that the strength of the data\ndepends on, the number of experts' opinion we can use\ncombined FCMs with several experts' opinions.\nAt the same time the disadvantage of the combined\nFCM is, when the weightages are 1 and \u20131 for the same Ci\nCj, given by 2 experts, we have the sum adding to zero thus\nat all times the connection matrices E1, ... , Ek may not be\nconformable for addition. Combined conflicting opinions\ntend to cancel out and assisted by the strong law of large\nnumbers, a consensus emerges as the sample opinion\napproximates the underlying population opinion. This\nproblem will be easily overcome if the FCM entries are only\n0 and 1. We have just briefly recalled the definitions. For\nmore about FCMs please refer Kosko [26, 27].\n1.2 Fuzzy Cognitive Maps \u2013 Properties and Models\nIn this section we just give some basic properties of FCMs\nand give illustration of the model. Fuzzy cognitive maps\n(FCMs) are more applicable when the data in the first place\nis an unsupervised one. The FCMs work on the opinion of\n\n13\n\n\fexperts. FCMs model the world as a collection of classes\nand causal relations between classes. FCMs are fuzzy\nsigned directed graphs with feedback. The directed edge eij\nfrom causal concept Ci to concept Cj measures how much Ci\ncauses Cj. The time varying concept function Ci(t) measures\nthe non negative occurrence of some fuzzy event, perhaps\nthe strength of a political sentiment, historical trend or\nmilitary objective. FCMs are used to model several types of\nproblems varying from gastric-appetite behavior, popular\npolitical developments etc. FCMs are also used to model in\nrobotics like plant control. The edges eij take values in the\nfuzzy causal interval [\u20131, 1]. eij = 0 indicates no causality, eij\n> 0 indicates causal increase, that is Cj increases as Ci\nincreases (or Cj decreases as Ci decreases). eij < 0 indicates\ncausal decrease or negative causality. Cj decreases as Ci\nincreases (or Cj increases as Ci decreases). Simple FCMs\nhave edge values in {\u20131, 0, 1}. Then if causality occurs, it\noccurs to a maximal positive or negative degree. Simple\nFCMs provide a quick first approximation to an expert\nstand or printed causal knowledge. We illustrate this by the\nfollowing, which gives a simple FCM of a Socio-economic\nmodel. A Socio-economic model is constructed with\nPopulation, Crime, Economic condition, Poverty and\nUnemployment as nodes or concepts. Here the simple\ntrivalent directed graph is given by the following Figure\n1.2.1, which is the experts opinion.\nPOPULATION\nC1\n\n-1\n\n+1\n+1\n\nPOVERTY\nC4\n-1\nECONOMIC\nCONDITION\nC3\n\nCRIME\nC2\n\n-1\n+1\n\n-1\n\n-1\nFIGURE: 1.2.1\n\n14\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT\nC5\n\n\fCausal feedback loops abound in FCMs in thick tangles.\nFeedback precludes the graph-search techniques used in\nartificial-intelligence expert systems.\nFCMs feedback allows experts to freely draw causal\npictures of their problems and allows causal adaptation\nlaws, infer causal links from simple data. FCM feedback\nforces us to abandon graph search, forward and especially\nbackward chaining. Instead we view the FCM as a\ndynamical system and take its equilibrium behavior as a\nforward-evolved inference. Synchronous FCMs behave as\nTemporal Associative Memories (TAM). We can always, in\ncase of a model, add two or more FCMs to produce a new\nFCM. The strong law of large numbers ensures in some\nsense that, knowledge reliability increases with expert\nsample size.\nWe reason with FCMs. We pass state vectors C\nrepeatedly through the FCM connection matrix E,\nthresholding or non-linearly transforming the result after\neach pass. Independent of the FCMs size, it quickly settles\ndown to a temporal associative memory limit cycle or fixed\npoint which is the hidden pattern of the system for that state\nvector C. The limit cycle or fixed-point inference\nsummarizes the joint effects of all the interacting fuzzy\nknowledge.\nExample 1.2.1: Consider the 5 \u00d7 5 causal connection matrix\nE that represents the socio economic model using FCM\nwhich is given in figure in Figure 1.2.1.\n\u23a1 0 0 \u22121 0 1 \u23a4\n\u23a2 0 0 0 \u22121 0 \u23a5\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\nE = \u23a2 0 \u2212 1 0 0 \u2212 1\u23a5\n\u23a2\n\u23a5\n\u23a2\u2212 1 1 0 0 0 \u23a5\n\u23a2\u23a3 0 0 0 1 0 \u23a5\u23a6\n\nConcepts/nodes can represent processes, events, values or\npolicies. Consider the first node C1 = 1. We hold or clamp\nC1 on the temporal associative memories, recall process.\n\n15\n\n\fThreshold signal functions synchronously update each\nconcept after each pass, through the connection matrix E.\nWe start with the population C1 = (1 0 0 0 0). The arrow\nindicates the threshold operation,\nC1 E\nC2 E\nC3 E\nC4 E\nC5 E\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(0 0 \u20131 0 1)\n(0 0 \u20131 1 1)\n(\u20131 1 \u20131 1 1)\n(\u20131 1 \u20131 0 1)\n(0 0 \u20131 0 1)\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 0 0 0 1)\n(1 0 0 1 1)\n(1 1 0 1 1)\n(1 1 0 0 1)\n(1 0 0 0 1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nC2\nC3\nC4\nC5\nC6 =\n\nC2.\n\nSo the increase in population results in the unemployment\nproblem, which is a limit cycle. For more about FCM refer\nKosko [26, 27] and for more about this socio economic\nmodel refer [74, 75].\nThis example illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of\nFCM analysis. FCM allows experts to represent factual and\nevaluative concepts in an interactive framework. Experts\ncan quickly draw FCM pictures or respond to\nquestionnaires. Experts can consent or dissent to the local\ncausal structure and perhaps the global equilibrium. The\nFCM knowledge representation and inferencing structure\nreduces to simple vector-matrix operations, favours\nintegrated circuit implementation and allows extension to\nneural statistical or dynamical system techniques. Yet an\nFCM equally encodes the experts' knowledge or ignorance,\nwisdom or prejudice. Worse, different experts differ in how\nthey assign causal strengths to edges and in which concepts\nthey deem causally relevant. The FCM seems merely to\nencode its designers' biases and may not even encode them\naccurately.\nFCM combination provides a partial solution to this\nproblem. We can additively superimpose each experts FCM\nin associative memory fashion, even though the FCM\nconnection matrices E1, ..., EK may not be conformable for\naddition. Combined conflicting opinions tend to cancel out\nand assisted with the strong law of large numbers, a\nconsensus emerges as the sample opinion approximates the\nunderlying population opinion. FCM combination allows\n\n16\n\n\fknowledge researchers to construct FCMs with iterative\ninterviews or questionnaire mailings.\nThe law of large numbers require that the random\nsamples be independent, identically distributed random\nvariables with finite variance. Independence models each\nexperts individually. Identical distribution models a\nparticular domain focus.\nWe combine arbitrary FCM connection matrices F1, F2,\n..., FK by adding augmented FCM matrices, F1, ..., FK.\nEach augmented matrix Fi has n-rows and n-columns n\nequals the total number of distinct concepts used by the\nexperts. We permute the rows and columns of the\naugmented matrices to bring them into mutual coincidence.\nThen we add the Fi's point wise to yield the combined FCM\nmatrix F.\nF = \u2211 Fi\ni\n\nWe can then use F to construct the combined FCM directed\ngraph.\nEven if each expert gives trivalent description in {\u20131, 0,\n1}, the combined (and normalized) FCM entry fij tends to be\nin {\u20131, 1}. (Here F = (fij)) The strong law of large numbers\nensures that fij provides a rational approximation to the\nunderlying unknown population opinion of how much Ci\naffects Cj. We can normalize fij by the number K of experts.\nExperts tend to give trivalent evaluations more readily and\nmore accurately than they give weighted evaluations. When\ntranscribing interviews or documents, a knowledge engineer\ncan more reliably determine an edge's sign than its\nmagnitude.\nSome experts may be more credible than others. We can\nweight each expert with non-negative credibility weight,\nweighing the augmented FCM matrix.\nF = \u03a3 wi Fi.\nThe weights need not be in [0, 1]; the only condition is they\nshould be non-negative. Different weights may produce\ndifferent equilibrium, limit cycles or fixed points as hidden\npatterns. We can also weigh separately any submatrix of\neach experts augmented FCM matrix.\n\n17\n\n\fAugmented FCM matrices imply that every expert\ncausally discusses every concept C1, ..., Cn. If an expert\ndoes not include Cj in his FCM model the expert implicitly\nsay that Cj is not causally relevant. So the jth row and the jth\ncolumn of his augmented connection matrix contains only\nzeros.\nThe only drawback which we felt while adopting FCM\nto several of the models is that we do not have a means to\nsay or express if the relation between two causal concepts\nCi and Cj is an indeterminate. So we in section five will\nadopt in FCM the concept of indeterminacy and rename the\nFuzzy Cognitive Maps as Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps as\nNeutrosophy enables one to accept the Truth, Falsehood and\nthe Indeterminate. Such situations very often occur when\nwe deal with unsupervised data that has more to do with\nfeelings. Like political scenario, child labor, child's\neducation, parent-children model, symptom-disease model,\npersonality-medicine model in case of Homeopathy\nmedicines, crime and punishment, in judicial problems\n(where evidences may be an indeterminate), problems of the\naged, female infanticide problem and so on and so forth,\nwhich will be discussed in section 1.4 and 1.5. Now we\nproceed on to define a special type of FCM namely Fuzzy\nRelational Maps.\nHere we mention some examples in which certain\nfactors are indeterminate but where we have used FCM to\nfind solutions. So that in section five we will use these for\nFCM model, Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps to study the\nsystems.\n1.3 Fuzzy Relational Maps\nIn this section, we introduce the notion of Fuzzy Relational\nMaps (FRMs); they are constructed analogous to FCMs\ndescribed and discussed in the earlier sections. In FCMs we\npromote the correlations between causal associations among\nconcurrently active units. But in FRMs we divide the very\ncausal associations into two disjoint units, for example, the\n\n18\n\n\frelation between a teacher and a student or relation between\nan employee or employer or a relation between doctor and\npatient and so on. Thus for us to define a FRM we need a\ndomain space and a range space which are disjoint in the\nsense of concepts. We further assume no intermediate\nrelation exists within the domain elements or node and the\nrange spaces elements. The number of elements in the range\nspace need not in general be equal to the number of\nelements in the domain space.\nThus throughout this section we assume the elements of\nthe domain space are taken from the real vector space of\ndimension n and that of the range space are real vectors\nfrom the vector space of dimension m (m in general need\nnot be equal to n). We denote by R the set of nodes R1,...,\nRm of the range space, where R = {(x1,..., xm) \u23d0xj = 0 or 1 }\nfor j = 1, 2,..., m. If xi = 1 it means that the node Ri is in the\nON state and if xi = 0 it means that the node Ri is in the OFF\nstate. Similarly D denotes the nodes D1, D2,..., Dn of the\ndomain space where D = {(x1,..., xn) \u23d0 xj = 0 or 1} for i = 1,\n2,..., n. If xi = 1 it means that the node Di is in the ON state\nand if xi = 0 it means that the node Di is in the OFF state.\nNow we proceed on to define a FRM.\nDEFINITION 1.3.1: A FRM is a directed graph or a map\nfrom D to R with concepts like policies or events etc, as\nnodes and causalities as edges. It represents causal\nrelations between spaces D and R .\nLet Di and Rj denote the two nodes of an FRM. The\ndirected edge from Di to Rj denotes the causality of Di on Rj\ncalled relations. Every edge in the FRM is weighted with a\nnumber in the set {0, \u00b11}. Let eij be the weight of the edge\nDiRj, eij \u2208 {0, \u00b11}. The weight of the edge Di Rj is positive, if\nincrease in Di implies increase in Rj or decrease in Di\nimplies decrease in Rj ie causality of Di on Rj is 1. If eij = 0,\nthen Di does not have any effect on Rj . We do not discuss\nthe cases when increase in Di implies decrease in Rj or\ndecrease in Di implies increase in Rj .\n\n19\n\n\fDEFINITION 1.3.2: When the nodes of the FRM are fuzzy\nsets then they are called fuzzy nodes. FRMs with edge\nweights {0, \u00b11} are called simple FRMs.\nDEFINITION 1.3.3: Let D1, ..., Dn be the nodes of the\ndomain space D of an FRM and R1, ..., Rm be the nodes of\nthe range space R of an FRM. Let the matrix E be defined\nas E = (eij) where eij is the weight of the directed edge DiRj\n(or RjDi), E is called the relational matrix of the FRM.\nNote: It is pertinent to mention here that unlike the FCMs\nthe FRMs can be a rectangular matrix with rows\ncorresponding to the domain space and columns\ncorresponding to the range space. This is one of the marked\ndifference between FRMs and FCMs.\nDEFINITION 1.3.4: Let D1, ..., Dn and R1,..., Rm denote the\nnodes of the FRM. Let A = (a1,...,an), ai \u2208 {0, \u00b11}. A is\ncalled the instantaneous state vector of the domain space\nand it denotes the on-off position of the nodes at any\ninstant. Similarly let B = (b1,..., bm) bi \u2208 {0, \u00b11}. B is called\ninstantaneous state vector of the range space and it denotes\nthe on-off position of the nodes at any instant, ai = 0 if ai is\noff and ai = 1 if ai is on for i= 1, 2,..., n Similarly, bi = 0 if\nbi is off and bi = 1 if bi is on, for i= 1, 2,..., m.\nDEFINITION 1.3.5: Let D1, ..., Dn and R1,..., Rm be the\nnodes of an FRM. Let DiRj (or Rj Di) be the edges of an\nFRM, j = 1, 2,..., m and i= 1, 2,..., n. Let the edges form a\ndirected cycle. An FRM is said to be a cycle if it posses a\ndirected cycle. An FRM is said to be acyclic if it does not\nposses any directed cycle.\nDEFINITION 1.3.6: An FRM with cycles is said to be an\nFRM with feedback.\nDEFINITION 1.3.7: When there is a feedback in the FRM,\ni.e. when the causal relations flow through a cycle in a\n\n20\n\n\frevolutionary manner, the FRM is called a dynamical\nsystem.\nDEFINITION 1.3.8: Let FRM be as described in definition\n1.3.5 be taken. Let Di Rj (or Rj Di), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nWhen Ri (or Dj) is switched on and if causality flows\nthrough edges of the cycle and if it again causes Ri (orDj),\nwe say that the dynamical system goes round and round.\nThis is true for any node Rj (or Di) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, (or 1 \u2264 j \u2264\nm). The equilibrium state of this dynamical system is called\nthe hidden pattern.\nDEFINITION 1.3.9: If the equilibrium state of a dynamical\nsystem is a unique state vector, then it is called a fixed\npoint. Consider an FRM with R1, R2,..., Rm and D1, D2,...,\nDn as nodes. For example, let us start the dynamical system\nby switching on R1 (or D1). Let us assume that the FRM\nsettles down with R1 and Rm (or D1 and Dn) on, i.e. the state\nvector remains as (1, 0, ..., 0, 1) in R (or 1, 0, 0, ... , 0, 1) in\nD), This state vector is called the fixed point.\nDEFINITION 1.3.10: If the FRM settles down with a state\nvector repeating in the form\nA1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 A3 \u2192 ... \u2192 Ai \u2192 A1\n(or B1 \u2192 B2 \u2192 ...\u2192 Bi \u2192 B1)\nthen this equilibrium is called a limit cycle.\nLet R1, R2,..., Rm and D1, D2,..., Dn be the nodes of a FRM\nwith feedback. Let E be the relational matrix. Let us find a\nhidden pattern when D1 is switched on i.e. when an input is\ngiven as vector A1 = (1, 0, ..., 0) in D1, the data should pass\nthrough the relational matrix E. This is done by multiplying\nA1 with the relational matrix E. Let A1E = (r1, r2,..., rm),\nafter thresholding and updating the resultant vector we get\nA1 E \u2208 R. Now let B = A1E we pass on B into ET and obtain\nBET. We update and threshold the vector BET so that BET\n\u2208D. This procedure is repeated till we get a limit cycle or a\nfixed point.\n\n21\n\n\fDEFINITION 1.3.11: Finite number of FRMs can be\ncombined together to produce the joint effect of all the\nFRMs. Let E1,..., Ep be the relational matrices of the FRMs\nwith nodes R1, R2,..., Rm and D1, D2,..., Dn, then the\ncombined FRM is represented by the relational matrix E =\nE1+...+ Ep.\n1.4 An Introduction to Neutrosophy and some Neutrosophic\nalgebraic structures\nIn this section we introduce the notion of neutrosophic logic\ncreated by Florentine Smarandache [55-59], which is an\nextension / combination of the fuzzy logic in which the\nindeterminacy is included. It has become very essential that\nthe notion of neutrosophic logic play a vital role in several\nof the real world problems like law, medicine, industry,\nfinance, IT, stocks and share etc. Use of neutrosophic\nnotions will be illustrated/ applied in the later sections of\nthis chapter. Fuzzy theory only measures the grade of\nmembership or the non-existence of a membership in the\nrevolutionary way but fuzzy theory has failed to attribute\nthe concept when the relations between notions or nodes or\nconcepts in problems are indeterminate. In fact one can say\nthe inclusion of the concept of indeterminate situation with\nfuzzy concepts will form the neutrosophic logic.\nAs in this book the concept of only fuzzy cognitive maps\nare dealt which mainly deals with the relation / non-relation\nbetween two nodes or concepts but it fails to deal the\nrelation between two conceptual nodes when the relation is\nan indeterminate one. Neutrosophic logic is the only tool\nknown to us, which deals with the notions of indeterminacy,\nand here we give a brief description of it. Throughout this\nbook I will denote indeterminacy of a relation / concept /\nnode. For more about Neutrosophic logic please refer\nSmarandache [55-59].\n\n22\n\n\fDEFINITION 1.4.1: In the neutrosophic logic every logical\nvariable x is described by an ordered triple x = (T, I, F)\nwhere T is the degree of truth, F is the degree of false and I\nthe level of indeterminacy.\n(A). To maintain consistency with the classical and fuzzy\nlogics and with probability there is the special case where T\n+ I + F = 1.\n(B). But to refer to intuitionistic logic, which means\nincomplete information on a variable proposition or event\none has T+ I+F <1.\n(C). Analogically referring to Paraconsistent logic, which\nmeans contradictory sources of information about a same\nlogical variable, proposition or event one has T + I + F >\n1.\nThus the advantage of using Neutrosophic logic is that this\nlogic distinguishes between relative truth that is a truth is\none or a few worlds only noted by 1 and absolute truth\ndenoted by 1+. Likewise neutrosophic logic distinguishes\nbetween relative falsehood, noted by 0 and absolute\nfalsehood noted by \u2013 0.\nIt has several applications. A few such illustrations are\ngiven in [55-59] which is as follows:\nExample 1.4.1: From a pool of refugees, waiting in a\npolitical refugee camp in Turkey to get the American visa,\na% have the chance to be accepted \u2013 where a varies in the\nset A, r% to be rejected \u2013 where r varies in the set R, and\np% to be in pending (not yet decided) \u2013 where p varies in P.\nSay, for example, that the chance of someone Popescu\nin the pool to emigrate to USA is (between) 40-60%\n(considering different criteria of emigration one gets\ndifferent percentages, we have to take care of all of them),\nthe chance of being rejected is 20-25% or 30-35%, and the\nchance of being in pending is 10% or 20% or 30%. Then the\nneutrosophic probability that Popescu emigrates to the\nUnites States is\n\n23\n\n\fNP (Popescu) = ((40 \u2013 60) (20 \u2013 25) \u222a (30 \u2013 35), {10, 20,\n30}), closer to the life.\nThis is a better approach than the classical probability,\nwhere 40 P(Popescu) 60, because from the pending chance\n\u2013 which will be converted to acceptance or rejection \u2013\nPopescu might get extra percentage in his will to emigrating\nand also the superior limit of the subsets sum\n60 + 35 + 30 > 100\nand in other cases one may have the inferior sum < 0, while\nin the classical fuzzy set theory the superior sum should be\n100 and the inferior sum \u03bc 0. In a similar way, we could say\nabout the element Popescu that Popescu ((40-60), (20-25) \u222a\n(30-35), {10, 20, 30}) belongs to the set of accepted\nrefugees.\nExample 1.4.2: The probability that candidate C will win an\nelection is say 25-30% true (percent of people voting for\nhim), 35% false (percent of people voting against him), and\n40% or 41% indeterminate (percent of people not coming to\nthe ballot box, or giving a blank vote \u2013 not selecting any\none or giving a negative vote cutting all candidate on the\nlist). Dialectic and dualism don't work in this case anymore.\nExample 1.4.3: Another example, the probability that\ntomorrow it will rain is say 50-54% true according to\nmeteorologists who have investigated the past years\nweather, 30 or 34-35% false according to today's very\nsunny and droughty summer, and 10 or 20% undecided\n(indeterminate).\nExample 1.4.4: The probability that Yankees will win\ntomorrow versus Cowboys is 60% true (according to their\nconfrontation's history giving Yankees' satisfaction), 3032% false (supposing Cowboys are actually up to the mark,\nwhile Yankees are declining), and 10 or 11 or 12%\nindeterminate (left to the hazard: sickness of players,\nreferee's mistakes, atmospheric conditions during the\ngame). These parameters act on players' psychology.\n\n24\n\n\fAs in this book we use mainly the notion of neutrosophic\nlogic with regard to the indeterminacy of any relation in\ncognitive maps we are restraining ourselves from dealing\nwith several interesting concepts about neutrosophic logic.\nAs FCMs deals with unsupervised data and the existence or\nnon-existence of cognitive relation, we do not in this book\njust recall the notion of neutrosophic concepts.\nIn this book we assume all fields to be real fields of\ncharacteristic 0 all vector spaces are taken as real spaces\nover reals and we denote the indeterminacy by 'I ' as i will\nmake a confusion as it denotes the imaginary value, viz i2 =\n\u20131 that is \u2212 1 = i. The indeterminacy I is such that I . I = I\n2\n= I.\nDEFINITION 1.4.2: Let K be the field of reals. We call the\nfield generated by K \u222a I to be the neutrosophic field for it\ninvolves the indeterminacy factor in it. We define I 2 = I, I +\nI = 2I i.e., I +...+ I = nI, and if k \u2208 K then k.I = kI, 0I = 0.\nWe denote the neutrosophic field by K(I) which is generated\nby K \u222a I that is K(I) = \u3008K \u222a I\u3009. (\u3008K \u222a I\u3009 denotes the field\ngenerated by K and I.\nExample 1.4.5: Let R be the field of reals. The neutrosophic\nfield of reals is generated by \u3008R \u222a I\u3009 i.e. R(I) clearly R \u2282\n\u3008R \u222a I\u3009.\nExample 1.4.6: Let Q be the field of rationals. The\nneutrosophic field of rational is generated by Q \u222a I denoted\nby Q(I).\nDEFINITION 1.4.3: Let K(I) be a neutrosophic field we say\nK(I) is a prime neutrosophic field if K(I) has no proper\nsubfield which is a neutrosophic field.\nExample 1.4.7: Q(I) is a prime neutrosophic field where as\nR(I) is not a prime neutrosophic field for Q(I) \u2282 R (I).\n\n25\n\n\fIt is very important to note that all neutrosophic fields used\nin this book are of characteristic zero. Likewise we can\ndefine neutrosophic subfield.\nDEFINITION 1.4.4: Let K(I) be a neutrosophic field, P \u2282\nK(I) is a neutrosophic subfield of P if P itself is a\nneutrosophic field. K(I) will also be called as the extension\nneutrosophic field of the neutrosophic field P.\nDEFINITION 1.4.5: Let Mnxm = {(aij) \u23d0 aij \u2208 K(I)}, where K\n(I), is a neutrosophic field.We call Mnxm to be the\nneutrosophic matrix.\nExample 1.4.8: Let Q(I ) = \u3008Q \u222a I\u3009 be the neutrosophic\nfield.\n\u239b 0 1 I\u239e\n\u239f\n\u239c\n\u2212 2 4I 0 \u239f\n\u239c\nM4x3 = \u239c\n1 \u2212 I 2\u239f\n\u239f\n\u239c\n\u239d 3I 1 0 \u23a0\n\nis the neutrosophic matrix, with entries from rationals and\nthe indeterminacy I.\nHowever we just state, suppose in a legal issue the jury\nor the judge cannot always prove the evidence in a case, in\nseveral places we may not be able to derive any conclusions\nfrom the existing facts because of which we cannot make a\nconclusion that no relation exists or otherwise. But existing\nrelation is an indeterminate. So in the case when the concept\nof indeterminacy exists the judgment ought to be very\ncarefully analyzed be it a civil case or a criminal case.\nFCMs are deployed only when the existence or nonexistence is dealt with but however in our Neutrosophic\nCognitive Maps we will deal with the notion of\nindeterminacy of the evidence also. Thus legal side has lot\nof Neutrosophic (NCM) applications. Also we will show\nhow NCMs can be used to study factors as varied as stock\nmarkets, medical diagnosis, etc.\n\n26\n\n\f1.5 Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCM)\nThe notion of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) which are\nfuzzy signed directed graphs with feedback are discussed\nand described in section 1.1. The directed edge eij from\ncausal concept Ci to concept Cj measures how much Ci\ncauses Cj. The time varying concept function Ci(t) measures\nthe non negative occurrence of some fuzzy event, perhaps\nthe strength of a political sentiment, historical trend or\nopinion about some topics like child labor or school\ndropouts etc. FCMs model the world as a collection of\nclasses and causal relations between them.\nThe edge eij takes values in the fuzzy causal interval [\u2013\n1, 1] (eij = 0 indicates no causality, eij > 0 indicates causal\nincrease; that Cj increases as Ci increases and Cj decreases\nas Ci decreases, eij < 0 indicates causal decrease or negative\ncausality Cj decreases as Ci increases or Cj, increases as Ci\ndecreases. Simple FCMs have edge value in {-1, 0, 1}. Thus\nif causality occurs it occurs to maximal positive or negative\ndegree.\nIt is important to note that eij measures only absence or\npresence of influence of the node Ci on Cj but till now any\nresearcher has not contemplated the indeterminacy of any\nrelation between two nodes Ci and Cj. When we deal with\nunsupervised data, there are situations when no relation can\nbe determined between some two nodes. So in this section\nwe try to introduce the indeterminacy in FCMs, and we\nchoose to call this generalized structure as Neutrosophic\nCognitive Maps (NCMs). In our view this will certainly\ngive a more appropriate result and also caution the user\nabout the risk of indeterminacy.\nNow we proceed on to define the concepts about NCMs.\nDEFINITION 1.5.1: A Neutrosophic Cognitive Map (NCM)\nis a neutrosophic directed graph with concepts like policies,\nevents etc. as nodes and causalities or indeterminates as\nedges. It represents the causal relationship between\nconcepts.\n\n27\n\n\fLet C1, C2, ..., Cn denote n nodes, further we assume each\nnode is a neutrosophic vector from neutrosophic vector\nspace V. So a node Ci will be represented by (x1, ..., xn)\nwhere xk's are zero or one or I (I is the indeterminate\nintroduced in Section 1.4 of chapter one) and xk = 1 means\nthat the node Ck is in the on state and xk = 0 means the node\nis in the off state and xk = I means the nodes state is an\nindeterminate at that time or in that situation.\nLet Ci and Cj denote the two nodes of the NCM. The\ndirected edge from Ci to Cj denotes the causality of Ci on Cj\ncalled connections. Every edge in the NCM is weighted\nwith a number in the set {\u20131, 0, 1, I}. Let eij be the weight\nof the directed edge CiCj, eij \u2208 {\u20131, 0, 1, I}. eij = 0 if Ci does\nnot have any effect on Cj, eij = 1 if increase (or decrease) in\nCi causes increase (or decreases) in Cj, eij = \u20131 if increase\n(or decrease) in Ci causes decrease (or increase) in Cj . eij = I\nif the relation or effect of Ci on Cj is an indeterminate.\nDEFINITION 1.5.2: NCMs with edge weight from {-1, 0, 1,\nI} are called simple NCMs.\nDEFINITION 1.5.3: Let C1, C2, ..., Cn be nodes of a NCM.\nLet the neutrosophic matrix N(E) be defined as N(E) = (eij),\nwhere eij is the weight of the directed edge Ci Cj, and eij \u2208\n{0, 1, -1, I}. N(E) is called the neutrosophic adjacency\nmatrix of the NCM.\nDEFINITION 1.5.4: Let C1, C2, ..., Cn be the nodes of the\nNCM. Let A = (a1, a2,..., an) where ai \u2208 {0, 1, I}. A is called\nthe instantaneous state neutrosophic vector and it denotes\nthe on \u2013 off \u2013 indeterminate state position of the node at an\ninstant\nai = 0 if ai is off (no effect)\nai = 1 if ai is on (has effect)\nai = I if ai is indeterminate(effect cannot be\ndetermined)\nfor i = 1, 2,..., n.\n\n28\n\n\fDEFINITION 1.5.5: Let C1, C2, ..., Cn be the nodes of the\nFCM. Let C1C 2 , C 2 C 3 , C 3 C 4 , ... , C i C j be the edges of the\nNCM. Then the edges form a directed cycle. An NCM is\nsaid to be cyclic if it possesses a directed cyclic. An NCM is\nsaid to be acyclic if it does not possess any directed cycle.\nDEFINITION 1.5.6: An NCM with cycles is said to have a\nfeedback. When there is a feedback in the NCM i.e. when\nthe causal relations flow through a cycle in a revolutionary\nmanner the NCM is called a dynamical system.\nDEFINITION 1.5.7: Let C1C 2 , C 2 C 3 , , C n \u22121C n be cycle,\nwhen Ci is switched on and if the causality flows through\nthe edges of a cycle and if it again causes Ci, we say that the\ndynamical system goes round and round. This is true for\nany node Ci, for i = 1, 2,..., n; the equilibrium state for this\ndynamical system is called the hidden pattern.\nDEFINITION 1.5.8: If the equilibrium state of a dynamical\nsystem is a unique state vector, then it is called a fixed\npoint. Consider the NCM with C1, C2,..., Cn as nodes. For\nexample let us start the dynamical system by switching on\nC1. Let us assume that the NCM settles down with C1 and Cn\non, i.e. the state vector remain as (1, 0,..., 1) this\nneutrosophic state vector (1,0,..., 0, 1) is called the fixed\npoint.\nDEFINITION 1.5.9: If the NCM settles with a neutrosophic\nstate vector repeating in the form\nA1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 ... \u2192 Ai \u2192 A1 ,\nthen this equilibrium state is called a limit cycle of the\nNCM.\nLet C1, C2,..., Cn be the nodes of an NCM, with feedback.\nLet E be the associated adjacency matrix. Let us find the\nhidden pattern when C1 is switched on when an input is\ngiven as the vector A1 = (1, 0, 0,..., 0), the data should pass\nthrough the neutrosophic matrix N(E), this is done by\n\n29\n\n\fmultiplying A1 by the matrix N(E). Let A1N(E) = (a1, a2,...,\nan) with the threshold operation that is by replacing ai by 1 if\nai \u2265 k and ai by 0 if ai < k (k \u2013 a suitable positive integer)\nand ai by I if ai is not a integer. We update the resulting\nconcept, the concept C1 is included in the updated vector by\nmaking the first coordinate as 1 in the resulting vector.\nSuppose A1N(E) \u2192 A2 then consider A2N(E) and repeat the\nsame procedure. This procedure is repeated till we get a\nlimit cycle or a fixed point.\nDEFINITION 1.5.10: Finite number of NCMs can be\ncombined together to produce the joint effect of all NCMs.\nIf N(E1), N(E2),..., N(Ep) be the neutrosophic adjacency\nmatrices of a NCM with nodes C1, C2,..., Cn then the\ncombined NCM is got by adding all the neutrosophic\nadjacency matrices N(E1),..., N(Ep). We denote the\ncombined NCMs adjacency neutrosophic matrix by N(E) =\nN(E1) + N(E2)+...+ N(Ep).\nNOTATION: Let (a1, a2, ... , an) and (a'1, a'2, ... , a'n) be two\nneutrosophic vectors. We say (a1, a2, ... , an) is equivalent to\n(a'1, a'2, ... , a'n) denoted by ((a1, a2, ... , an) ~ (a'1, a'2, ..., a'n)\nif (a'1, a'2, ... , a'n) is got after thresholding and updating the\nvector (a1, a2, ... , an) after passing through the neutrosophic\nadjacency matrix N(E).\nThe following are very important:\nNote 1: The nodes C1, C2, ..., Cn are nodes and not\nindeterminate nodes because they indicate the concepts\nwhich are well known. But the edges connecting Ci and Cj\nmay be indeterminate i.e. an expert may not be in a position\nto say that Ci has some causality on Cj either will he be in a\nposition to state that Ci has no relation with Cj in such cases\nthe relation between Ci and Cj which is indeterminate is\ndenoted by I.\nNote 2: The nodes when sent will have only ones and zeros\ni.e. on and off states, but after the state vector passes\nthrough the neutrosophic adjacency matrix the resultant\n\n30\n\n\fvector will have entries from {0, 1, I} i.e. they can be\nneutrosophic vectors.\nThe presence of I in any of the coordinate implies the\nexpert cannot say the presence of that node i.e. on state of it\nafter passing through N(E) nor can we say the absence of\nthe node i.e. off state of it the effect on the node after\npassing through the dynamical system is indeterminate so\nonly it is represented by I. Thus only in case of NCMs we\ncan say the effect of any node on other nodes can also be\nindeterminates. Such possibilities and analysis is totally\nabsent in the case of FCMs.\nNote 3: In the neutrosophic matrix N(E), the presence of I\nin the aijth place shows, that the causality between the two\nnodes i.e. the effect of Ci on Cj is indeterminate. Such\nchances of being indeterminate is very possible in case of\nunsupervised data and that too in the study of FCMs which\nare derived from the directed graphs.\nThus only NCMs helps in such analysis.\nNow we shall represent a few examples to show how in\nthis set up NCMs is preferred to FCMs. At the outset before\nwe proceed to give examples we make it clear that all\nunsupervised data need not have NCMs to be applied to it.\nOnly data which have the relation between two nodes to be\nan indeterminate need to be modeled with NCMs if the data\nhas no indeterminacy factor between any pair of nodes one\nneed not go for NCMs; FCMs will do the best job.\n1.6 Neutrosophic Relational Maps - Definition with Examples\nWhen the nodes or concepts under study happens to be such\nthat they can be divided into two disjoint classes and a study\nor analysis can be made using Fuzzy Relational Maps\n(FRMs) which was introduced and described in the earlier\nsection. Here we define a new concept called Neutrosophic\nRelational Maps (NRMs), analyse and study them. We also\ngive examples of them.\n\n31\n\n\fDEFINITION 1.6.1: Let D be the domain space and R be the\nrange space with D1,..., Dn the conceptual nodes of the\ndomain space D and R1,..., Rm be the conceptual nodes of\nthe range space R such that they form a disjoint class i.e. D\n\u2229 R = \u03c6. Suppose there is a FRM relating D and R and if at\nleast a edge relating a Di Rj is an indeterminate then we call\nthe FRMs as the Neutrosophic relational maps. i.e. NRMs.\nNote: In everyday occurrences we see that if we are\nstudying a model built using an unsupervised data we need\nnot always have some edge relating the nodes of a domain\nspace and a range space or there does not exist any relation\nbetween two nodes, it can very well happen that for any two\nnodes one may not be always in a position to say that the\nexistence or nonexistence of a relation, but we may say that\nthe relation between two nodes is an indeterminate or\ncannot be decided.\nThus to the best of our knowledge indeterminacy\nmodels can be built using neutrosophy. One model already\ndiscussed is the Neutrosophic Cognitive Model. The other\nbeing the Neutrosophic Relational Maps model, which are a\nfurther generalization of Fuzzy Relational Maps model.\nIt is not essential when a study/ prediction/ investigation\nis made we are always in a position to find a complete\nanswer. This is not always possible (sometimes or many a\ntimes) it is almost all models built using unsupervised data,\nwe may have the factor of indeterminacy to play a role.\nSuch study is possible only by using the Neutrosophic logic.\nExample 1.6.1: Female infanticide (the practice of killing\nfemale children at birth or shortly thereafter) is prevalent in\nIndia from the early vedic times, as women were (and still\nare) considered as a property. As long as a woman is treated\nas a property/ object the practice of female infanticide will\ncontinue in India.\nIn India, social factors play a major role in female\ninfanticide. Even when the government recognized the girl\nchild as a critical issue for the country's development, India\ncontinues to have an adverse ratio of women to men. Other\n\n32\n\n\freasons being torture of the in-laws may also result in cruel\ndeath of a girl child. This is mainly due to the fact that men\nare considered superior to women. Also they take into\naccount the fact that men are breadwinners for the family.\nEven if women work like men, parents think that her efforts\nis going to end once she is married and enters a new family.\nStudies have consistently shown that girl babies in India\nare denied the same and equal food and medical care that\nthe boy babies receive. Girl babies die more often than boy\nbabies even though medical research has long ago\nestablished that girls are generally biologically stronger as\nnew-borns than boys. The birth of a male child is a time for\ncelebration, but the birth of female child is often viewed as\na crisis. Thus the female infanticide cannot be attributed to\nsingle reason it is highly dependent on the feeling of\nindividuals ranging from social stigma, monetary waste,\nsocial status etc.\nSuppose we take the conceptual nodes for the\nunsupervised data relating to the study of female\ninfanticide. We take the status of the people as the domain\nspace D\nD1\nD2\nD3\nD4\nD5\nD6\nD7\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nvery rich\nrich\nupper middle class\nmiddle class\nlower middle class\npoor\nvery poor.\n\nThe nodes of the range space R are taken as\nR1 \u2013 Number of female children - a problem\nR2 \u2013 Social stigma of having female children\nR3 \u2013 Torture by in-laws for having only female\nchildren\nR4 \u2013 Economic loss / burden due to female\nchildren\n\n33\n\n\fR5 \u2013 Insecurity due to having only female\nchildren (They will marry and enter different homes\nthereby leaving their parents, so no one would be\nable to take care of them in later days.)\nKeeping these as nodes of the range space and the domain\nspace experts opinion were drawn which is given by the\nfollowing Figure 1.6.1:\nD1\nR1\nD2\n\nR2\n\nD3\n\nD4\nR3\nD5\nR4\nD6\nR5\nD7\nFIGURE: 1.6.1\n\nFigure 1.6.1 is the neutrosophic directed graph of the NRM\nwhere the dotted lines show the indeterminacy relation.\n\n34\n\n\fThe corresponding neutrosophic relational matrix N(R)T is\ngiven below:\n\u23a1I\n\u23a20\n\u23a2\nN(R)T = \u23a21\n\u23a2\n\u23a20\n\u23a2\u23a31\n\n1 0 1 1 0\u23a4\n1 1 1 0 0\u23a5\u23a5\n1 1 1 1 0\u23a5 and\n\u23a5\n0 0 1 1 I\u23a5\n1 0 1 1 I I \u23a5\u23a6\n0\n0\n1\nI\n\n\u23a1I\n\u23a20\n\u23a2\n\u23a21\n\u23a2\nN(R) = \u23a20\n\u23a21\n\u23a2\n\u23a21\n\u23a20\n\u23a3\n\n0 1 0 1\u23a4\n0 1 I 1\u23a5\u23a5\n1 1 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 1 0 1\u23a5 .\n1 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 1 1 I\u23a5\n0 0 I I \u23a5\u23a6\n\nSuppose A1 = (0 1 0 0 0) is the instantaneous state vector\nunder consideration i.e., social stigma of having female\nchildren. The effect of A1 on the system N(R) is\nA1N(R)T =\nB1[N(R)] =\nA2[N(R)]T =\nJ\nB2(N(R)) =\nJ\n\n(0 0 1 1 1 0 0) J (0 0 1 1 1 0 0) =\n(2, 3, 3, 1, 2) J (1 1 1 1 1)\n=\n(1 + I, 1 + I, 1, 1, 1, 1 + I, I)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 I) = B2\n(I + 3, 3, 5, 2I + 2, 2I + 4)\n(1 1 1 1 1) = A3 = A1.\n\nB1\nA2\n\nThus this state vector A1 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0) gives a fixed point\n(1 1 1 1 1) indicating if one thinks that having female\nchildren is a social stigma immaterial of their status they\nalso feel that having number of female children is a\nproblem, it is a economic loss / burden, they also under go\ntorture or bad treatment by in-laws and ultimately it is a\ninsecurity for having only female children, the latter two\ncases hold where applicable.\n\n35\n\n\fOn the other hand we derive the following conclusions\non the domain space when the range space state vector A1 =\n(0 1 0 0 0) is sent\nA1[N(R)]T J B1\nB1[N(R)] J A2\nA2 [N(R)]T J B2\nB2[N(R)] J A3 = A2 so\nA2 [N(R)]T J B2 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, I)\nleading to a fixed point. When the state vector A1 = (0, 1, 0,\n0, 0) is sent to study i.e. the social stigma node is on\nuniformly all people from all economic classes are\nawakened expect the very poor for the resultant vector\nhappens to be a Neutrosophic vector hence one is not in a\nposition to say what is the feeling of the very poor people\nand the \"many female children are a social stigma\" as that\ncoordinate remains as an indeterminate one. This is typical\nof real-life scenarios, for the working classes hardly\ndistinguish much when it comes to the gender of the child.\nSeveral or any other instantaneous vector can be used\nand its effect on the Neutrosophical Dynamical System can\nbe studied and analysed. This is left as an exercise for the\nreader.\nHaving seen an example and application or construction\nof the NRM model we will proceed on to describe the\nconcepts of it in a more mathematical way.\nDESCRIPTION OF A NRM:\nNeutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCMs) promote the causal\nrelationships between concurrently active units or decides\nthe absence of any relation between two units or the\nindeterminance of any relation between any two units. But\nin Neutrosophic Relational Maps (NRMs) we divide the\nvery causal nodes into two disjoint units. Thus for the\nmodeling of a NRM we need a domain space and a range\nspace which are disjoint in the sense of concepts. We\nfurther assume no intermediate relations exist within the\ndomain and the range spaces. The number of elements or\n\n36\n\n\fnodes in the range space need not be equal to the number of\nelements or nodes in the domain space.\nThroughout this section we assume the elements of a\ndomain space are taken from the neutrosophic vector space\nof dimension n and that of the range space are from the\nneutrosophic vector space of dimension m. (m in general\nneed not be equal to n). We denote by R the set of nodes\nR1,..., Rm of the range space, where R = {(x1,..., xm) \u23d0xj = 0\nor 1 or I for j = 1, 2, ..., m}.\nIf xi = 1 it means that node Ri is in the on state and if xi\n= 0 it means that the node Ri is in the off state and if xi = I\nin the resultant vector it means the effect of the node xi is\nindeterminate or whether it will be off or on cannot be\npredicted by the neutrosophic dynamical system.\nIt is very important to note that when we send the state\nvectors they are always taken as the real state vectors for we\nknow the node or the concept is in the on state or in the off\nstate but when the state vector passes through the\nNeutrosophic dynamical system some other node may\nbecome indeterminate i.e. due to the presence of a node we\nmay not be able to predict the presence or the absence of the\nother node i.e., it is indeterminate, denoted by the symbol I,\nthus the resultant vector can be a neutrosophic vector.\nDEFINITION 1.6.2: A Neutrosophic Relational Map (NRM)\nis a Neutrosophic directed graph or a map from D to R with\nconcepts like policies or events etc. as nodes and causalities\nas edges. (Here by causalities we mean or include the\nindeterminate causalities also). It represents Neutrosophic\nRelations and Causal Relations between spaces D and R .\nLet Di and Rj denote the nodes of an NRM. The directed\nedge from Di to Rj denotes the causality of Di on Rj called\nrelations. Every edge in the NRM is weighted with a number\nin the set {0, +1, \u20131, I}. Let eij be the weight of the edge Di\nRj, eij \u2208 {0, 1, \u20131, I}. The weight of the edge Di Rj is positive\nif increase in Di implies increase in Rj or decrease in Di\nimplies decrease in Rj i.e. causality of Di on Rj is 1. If eij = \u2013\n1 then increase (or decrease) in Di implies decrease (or\nincrease) in Rj. If eij = 0 then Di does not have any effect on\n\n37\n\n\fRj. If eij = I it implies we are not in a position to determine\nthe effect of Di on Rj i.e. the effect of Di on Rj is an\nindeterminate so we denote it by I.\nDEFINITION 1.6.3: When the nodes of the NRM take edge\nvalues from {0, 1, \u20131, I} we say the NRMs are simple NRMs.\nDEFINITION 1.6.4: Let D1, ..., Dn be the nodes of the\ndomain space D of an NRM and let R1, R2,..., Rm be the\nnodes of the range space R of the same NRM. Let the matrix\nN(E) be defined as N(E) = (eij ) where eij is the weight of the\ndirected edge Di Rj (or Rj Di ) and eij \u2208 {0, 1, \u20131, I}. N(E) is\ncalled the Neutrosophic Relational Matrix of the NRM.\nThe following remark is important and interesting to find its\nmention in this book.\nRemark: Unlike NCMs, NRMs can also be rectangular\nmatrices with rows corresponding to the domain space and\ncolumns corresponding to the range space. This is one of\nthe marked difference between NRMs and NCMs. Further\nthe number of entries for a particular model which can be\ntreated as disjoint sets when dealt as a NRM has very much\nless entries than when the same model is treated as a NCM.\nThus in many cases when the unsupervised data under\nstudy or consideration can be spilt as disjoint sets of nodes\nor concepts; certainly NRMs are a better tool than the\nNCMs.\nDEFINITION 1.6.5: Let D1, ..., Dn and R1,..., Rm denote the\nnodes of a NRM. Let A = (a1,..., an ), ai \u2208 {0, 1, I} is called\nthe Neutrosophic instantaneous state vector of the domain\nspace and it denotes the on-off position or indeterminate\nstate of the nodes at any instant. Similarly let B = (b1,..., bn)\nbi \u2208 {0, 1, I}, B is called instantaneous state vector of the\nrange space and it denotes the on-off position of the nodes\nat any instant, ai = 0 if ai is off and ai = 1 if ai is on for i =\n1, 2, ..., n. Similarly, bi = 0 if bi is off and bi = 1 if bi is on\nfor i = 1, 2,..., m. ai = I or bi = I gives the indeterminate\n\n38\n\n\fstate at that time or in that situation for i = 1, 2, ..., m or i\n= 1, 2, ..., n.\nDEFINITION 1.6.6: Let D1,..., Dn and R1, R2,..., Rm be the\nnodes of a NRM. Let Di Rj (or Rj Di ) be the edges of an\nNRM, j = 1, 2,..., m and i = 1, 2,..., n. The edges form a\ndirected cycle. An NRM is said to be a cycle if it possess a\ndirected cycle. An NRM is said to be acyclic if it does not\npossess any directed cycle.\nDEFINITION 1.6.7: A NRM with cycles is said to be a NRM\nwith feedback.\nDEFINITION 1.6.8: When there is a feedback in the NRM\ni.e. when the causal relations flow through a cycle in a\nrevolutionary manner the NRM is called a Neutrosophic\ndynamical system.\nDEFINITION 1.6.9: Let Di Rj (or Rj Di) 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\nwhen Rj (or Di ) is switched on and if causality flows\nthrough edges of a cycle and if it again causes Rj (or Di ) we\nsay that the Neutrosophical dynamical system goes round\nand round. This is true for any node Rj ( or Di ) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m\n(or 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). The equilibrium state of this Neutrosophical\ndynamical system is called the Neutrosophic hidden pattern.\nDEFINITION 1.6.10: If the equilibrium state of a\nNeutrosophical dynamical system is a unique Neutrosophic\nstate vector, then it is called the fixed point. Consider an\nNRM with R1, R2, ..., Rm and D1, D2,..., Dn as nodes. For\nexample let us start the dynamical system by switching on\nR1 (or D1). Let us assume that the NRM settles down with R1\nand Rm (or D1 and Dn) on, or indeterminate or off, i.e. the\nNeutrosophic state vector remains as (1, 0, 0,..., 1) or (1, 0,\n0,...I) (or (1, 0, 0,...1) or (1, 0, 0,...I) in D), this state vector\nis called the fixed point.\nDEFINITION 1.6.11: If the NRM settles down with a state\nvector repeating in the form A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 A3 \u2192 ...\u2192 Ai \u2192 A1\n\n39\n\n\f(or B1 \u2192 B2 \u2192 ...\u2192 Bi \u2192 B1) then this equilibrium is called\na limit cycle.\nLet R1, R2,..., Rm and D1, D2,..., Dn be the nodes of a NRM\nwith feedback. Let N(E) be the Neutrosophic Relational\nMatrix. Let us find the hidden pattern when D1 is switched\non i.e. when an input is given as a vector; A1 = (1, 0, ..., 0)\nin D; the data should pass through the relational matrix\nN(E). This is done by multiplying A1 with the Neutrosophic\nrelational matrix N(E). Let A1N(E) = (r1, r2,..., rm) after\nthresholding and updating the resultant vector we get A1E \u2208\nR. Now let B = A1E we pass on B into the system (N(E))T\nand obtain B(N(E))T. We update and threshold the vector\nB(N(E))T so that B(N(E))T \u2208 D.\nThis procedure is repeated till we get a limit cycle or a\nfixed point.\nDEFINITION 1.6.12: Finite number of NRMs can be\ncombined together to produce the joint effect of all NRMs.\nLet N(E1), N(E2),..., N(Er) be the Neutrosophic relational\nmatrices of the NRMs with nodes R1,..., Rm and D1,...,Dn,\nthen the combined NRM is represented by the neutrosophic\nrelational matrix N(E) = N(E1) + N(E2) +...+ N(Er).\nFor more about FCM, FRM, Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps\nand Neutrosophic Relational Maps, please refer Book [77].\n\n40\n\n\fChapter Two\n\nUNTOUCHABILITY: PERIYAR'S VIEW\nAND PRESENT DAY SITUATION\nA Fuzzy and Neutrosophic Analysis\n\nIn this chapter, we use experts' opinions, documented\nwritings and speeches of Periyar and contemporary casteist\natrocities to analyze the evils of untouchability and its\nconsequences using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and\nNeutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCMs). For the first time,\nwe use mathematical models to analyze untouchability. We\nspecifically use Fuzzy and Neutrosophic models.\nAt the first stage, since the term untouchability is a\nvague and ill-defined concept because of its diverse\nmanifestations, we use fuzzy and neutrosophic models. Our\nstudy would be very vast if we take into consideration the\nnotion of untouchability from the time of the ancient\nlawgiver Manu (approx. 1 Common Era)1. So, we\nspecifically study the social effects of untouchability during\nPeriyar E. V. Ramasamy's lifetime (1879-1973).2\nA relentless crusader for social justice, Periyar fought\nagainst the caste system for more than half a century. He\nrendered thousands of speeches condemning it and wrote\nhundreds of articles against it in his newspapers and\nmagazines like Kudiarasu, Viduthalai, Revolt, etc. and his\nstruggle had far-reaching impact in the Tamil society.\nAlways a leader of mass organizations, he served as the\nState President of the Congress party, founded the Self1\n2\n\nWendy Doniger, The Laws of Manu, Penguin, 1991.\nFor more biographical information refer p.103-113 of this book.\n\n41\n\n\fRespect Movement, was a leader of the Justice Party, later\nthe Dravidar Kazhagam, he was undoubtedly a populist\nleader and a man of the masses. He fought against the caste\nsystem by organizing demonstrations and was arrested and\nincarcerated several times.\nIn this chapter we analyze his views and the present\nstate of untouchability in India using the two technical\ntools: Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and Neutrosophic\nCognitive Maps (NCMs).\nThis chapter is divided into six sections. In the first\nsection, we analyze the evils of untouchability due to\nHinduism and its codes. In section two, the discrimination\nfaced by Dalits and Sudras in the field of education is\nstudied. In section three, we analyze the social inequality\nexperienced by Dalits and Sudras. In section four we\nanalyze the discrimination faced by Dalits in the political\nfield. Economic threat faced by Dalits due to untouchability\nis studied in section five.\nAll the above sections utilize the two tools FCMs and\nNCMs. In the final section we analyze the generalized\nsocial problem of untouchability using a different tool,\nFuzzy Relational Maps (FRMs).\nExperts' opinions are given verbatim. No change or\nmodification has been made since it would make the data\nbiased. Further, in most places, we provide an exact\ndescription of the concepts/nodes as specified by the expert\nwho have their own views about untouchability.\nIn several models, the nodes were very intricately\ndefined by the experts, so, the ON state of a single practice\nof untouchability made the resultant, hidden pattern of the\ndynamical system to give fixed point in which all the nodes\n(connected to practices of untouchability) were in the ON\nstate. Most of the directed graphs obtained from the experts'\nopinions were highly dense.\nWe have refrained from giving our views since the sole\npurpose of this study is a mathematical analysis of\nuntouchability.\n\n42\n\n\f2.1 Analysis of untouchability due to Hindu religion using\nFCMs and NCMs\nWe proceed on to categorize untouchability practiced due to\nHindu religion. Nodes related to religious untouchability, as\ngiven by an expert who is a social activist, are as follows:\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nR7\nR8\nR9\nR10\nR11\nR12\nR13\nR14\nR15\n\n-\n\nReligion\nSuperstition\nFaith in particular religious sect\nDiscrimination in religion\nNo freedom of choice (caste is birth-based)\nUntouchability\nCaste system\nPsychological oppression\nDiscrimination in social outlook\nPractice of Varnashrama Dharma\nSocial identity\nSocial fear\nSocial binding\nSocial rituals\nSolace\n\nAs described by the expert, these attributes are explained\nbelow.\nR1 \u2013 Religion\nBy the term 'religion' the expert refers to the social codes\nand spiritual activities one is supposed to follow by\nbelonging to a particular caste.\nThis expert points out the difference between the native\nreligion of the Tamil people and the casteist religion of the\nAryans (which was based on the Manusmriti and Vedas),\nwhich gave sanction to untouchability, and hierarchy among\nthe people. He says that there was no historical evidence for\nthe existence of religion that could be labeled Hinduism.\nHe even adds that the social and spiritual practices\nfollowed by the indigenous people were distinctly different\n\n43\n\n\fcompared to the practices prescribed by the Manu Smriti\n(Laws of Manu). He also pointed out the vast differences\nbetween these two systems.\nA woman was never considered a possession of her\nfather, son or husband in the Tamil culture. She was free to\nchoose her husband unlike in the Manuvadi culture. This is\na contradiction in the case of women identity among the\nancient Tamils and the Manu Smriti. This is strong evidence\nthat the way of life of the Tamilians was in no way related\nto Manu Smriti.\nLikewise there were several differences in rituals, gods,\nsacrifices, modes of worship etc.\nThis expert points out that the splendid Tamil text\nThirukkural was written by a Paraiyar called Valluvar,\nwhereas Aryan religion banned education to Sudras.\nR2: Superstition\nIn every culture, superstition was a negative force that\neclipsed the scientific development of human beings. The\nfear of snakes made them worship it with a superstition that\nit would consequently not harm them.\nAccording to this expert, superstition has become so\nstrong in this modern India that even monkeys are\nworshipped in the form of Hanuman, whose tiny statues\nlitter the countryside and giant statue line the highways!\nThis has no scientific rhyme or reason! Thus the 21st\ncentury's wave of superstition is the worship of monkey.\nHanuman statues up to 60 feet in height are worshiped in\nTamil Nadu. Why does nobody question this stupidity?\nThen, the cow is treated as sacred to Hindus and is\nconsidered a mother by all Hindus. So caste-Hindus don't\nconsume its meat and consider its hide polluting. This has\nresulted in ban on cow slaughter that has affected the\nlivelihood of Dalits. Several other irrational behaviors can\nbe discussed.\nFor instance, the concepts of purity and pollution are\nmerely religious taboos.\n\n44\n\n\fR3: Faith in a particular religious sect\nIf anyone takes a statistics of the number of people\nconverting to Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism or Islam from\ntheir native religion, Dalits would top that list. They convert\nto other religions because they find Hinduism to be very\noppressive and they strive to escape from caste atrocities.\nMany of them feel that the change of faith has changed their\nlifestyle and socio-economic status. Besides, the vicious\ncycle of 'karma' can be broken by religious conversion.\nFaith gives hope for betterment. Faith also provides\nthem an improved identity and a new sense of belonging.\nR4 \u2013 Discrimination in religion\nThe Hindu religion follows the fourfold varna structure. At\nthe head of the hierarchy come the Brahmins (priestly\nclass), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants and\nartisans) and Sudras (slaves). Outside this caste-Hindu fold\nare the Untouchables, also called the Panchamas. These\nfour varnas are in turn divided into thousands of castes and\nsub-castes.\nAccording to classic Hinduism \u0327 the origin of the caste\nsystem is as old as the origin of the human race itself. The\nstory of this cosmogonic myth regarding the creation of the\nphysical elements of the universe from the Rig Veda goes as\nfollows:\n\"The gods made a Man [Purusha] who had a\nthousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.\nWhen the gods spread the sacrifice, using the Man\nas the offering, spring was the clarified butter,\nsummer the fuel, autumn the oblation.\nFrom that sacrifice in which everything was\noffered, the clarified butter was obtained, and they\nmade it into those beasts who live in the air, in the\nforest and in villages.\nHis mouth was the Brahmins, his arms were\nmade into the Kshatriyas, his thighs became the\n\n45\n\n\fVaishyas and his feet became the Shudras. The\nmoon was born from his mind; the sun was born\nfrom his eye.\"\nThe pity is that Dalits don't even find mention in the\ncreation. Even their shadow is considered polluting. Rigid\nmathematical computations decree that some castes are\npolluting at four feet, some at eight feet, and some as far as\neven sixty-four feet.\nDiscrimination against Dalits is dominant even today in\nthe public and private spheres of life. Prior to Indian\nindependence, Dalits where not even allowed into temples.\nEven now, in rural areas Dalits cannot walk on temple\nstreets or enter caste-Hindu temples. When Dalits demand\ntheir rights to temple entry and temple property, it often\nresults in the eruption of large-scale violence and\nbloodshed.\nR5: No freedom of choice\nAlthough the Constitution of India gives the freedom to\npreach and practice any religion of ones choice, in practice\nthis is not so straight or simple. Dalits who convert to\nChristianity or Islam lose the benefits of reservation in\neducation and employment because they are no longer\ntreated as Dalits. So, it is a choiceless situation for them. If\nthey leave Hinduism which is imposed on them, they lose\nthe benefits of affirmative action. So, majority of the Dalits\ncontinue to remain in their same state, without converting to\nother religions.\nR6: Untouchability\nThis concept is closely interconnected with R1, religion. It is\nreligion that has sanctioned untouchability and imposed it\nupon people. Only an untouchable is untouchable, but all\nthe products of his labour (farming, leather work, etc.) are\ntouchable. It proves that this concept is only to subjugate a\n\n46\n\n\fsection of people. The concept of untouchability has made\nsome people into permanent slaves.\nNot only where some people called untouchable, but a\nfew of them were even made unseeables such as the Nadar\nand Pudharai Vannars.\nThe Brahmins created this idea of untouchability in\norder to protect themselves as a superior group. The very\nroot of untouchability lies in the laws of Manu, which was a\ncodification of existing caste practices. Untouchability is a\nby-product of the caste system.\nR7: Caste system\nOne of the most peculiarly oppressive systems, all the castes\nand the thousands of sub-castes are religiously forbidden, to\nintermarry, or interdine, or engage in social activity with\nany but members of their own group. The caste system was\nclearly an ideological construct of the upper castes to\nmaintain their sinister monopoly over cultural capital\n(knowledge and education), social capital (status and\npatriarchal domination), political capital (power) and\nmaterial capital (wealth).\nThis expert quoted revolutionary Dr.Ambedkar: \"Caste\nis not a division of labour, it is a division of labourers.\"\nThe concept of superiority and inferiority and the\nhierarchy of caste system has claimed millions of lives\nthrough riots, rampages and bloodshed. Needless to say that\nthe major victims were only Dalits and Sudras.\nR8: Psychological oppression\nBecause of the caste hierarchy, concepts of superiority and\ninferiority are ingrained in the minds of people. This\npsychologically suppresses the Dalits and the Sudras from\nreaching their true potential. Brahmins are considered\n'intellectual' and they use their superiority to snub and deny\neducation and opportunities to the lower castes and Dalits.\nSince the caste-system is birth-based, people have no\n\n47\n\n\fchance of getting rid of caste or their inferior identity. So it\noppresses them psychologically.\nR9 \u2013 Social discrimination\n(According to this expert this concept is different from the\nconcept of religious discrimination, i.e. node R4).\nDalits are denied their civil rights. They are treated as\nsocially inferior people. For centuries Dalits have been\nliving in separate, segregated settlements known as the\ncheri, which is situated outside the caste Hindu village\n(oor). In certain places, they are not allowed to walk on the\nstreets wearing slippers. In backward areas where casteism\nis rampant, Dalits are not allowed to carry umbrellas, ride\nbicycles or wear new clothes. They are not allowed to draw\nwater from common ponds, or graze their cattle on public\ngrounds. In teashops in many villages, the two-tumbler\nsystem is rampant: one set of tumblers for the caste-Hindus\nand another for the Dalits. Even very old Dalit men are\naddressed in the singular and treated disrespectfully by\nsmall caste-Hindu boys. Even after death they are treated\ndifferently, because caste-Hindus and Dalits have separate\nburial grounds. Inter-caste marriages are strictly prohibited.\nIn several cases, those who dare to love across caste lines\nhave to face the dire consequence of death.\nR10 \u2013 Varnashrama Dharma\nIt was the earlier, original form of the caste system. Only\nthe four varna system developed into the thousands of jatis\n(castes) and sub-castes. Varnashrama Dharma decided ones\nposition in life and the caste-based occupation they had to\nfollow hereditarily. In a democratic nation, one must have\nthe right to choose ones profession. But it is not so.\nVarnashrama Dharma robs people of the basic equality of\nopportunity. Dalits and Sudra students have to overcome all\nsorts of obstacles in order to get educated and employed.\n\n48\n\n\fAll promotions, perks and increments etc. are denied to\nthem, and they are labeled 'quota' people because they\nmight have benefited from affirmative action.\nThus even if they come out of the clutches of the\nVarnashrama Dharma they are the worst victims of\ndiscrimination.\nR11 \u2013 Social identity\nEverybody requires a social identity, and sense of belonging\nto a larger power group. The Dalits and Sudras are unable to\nthrow away their identity of being outcastes and 'lower'\ncastes. The quest for an improved social identity and selfrespect triggers religious conversions.\nR12 \u2013 Social Fear\nOut of social fear they identify themselves with a particular\ncaste and lead a life of constant suffering. For instance the\nSudras think that they will be treated as outcastes (a\ncategory lower to them) so they emphasize their caste\nstatus.\nSo it is the social fear (of being considered lower than\nwhat they are in the hierarchy) inherent in them makes them\naccept their caste. This is because the caste system has been\nimposed on them and they have begun to value it.\nR13 \u2013 Social Bonding\nThe expert is of the opinion that they become socially\nbonded along caste lines because of social fear, fear of\nfurther exploitation, ill treatment, and harassment. For the\nsake of sheer existence, peace and to avoid further torture\nthey accept the social bond.\nR14 \u2013 Social Rituals\nThey are involuntarily forced to practice social rituals in\naccordance with religion mainly due to social identification,\n\n49\n\n\fsocial fear and social binding (nodes R11, R12 and R13). The\nexpert says that social celebrations and festivals are highly\nritualistic and intended to develop the bonding within a\ncommunity as well as mark their identity.\nR15 \u2013 Solace\nAny human follows a religion and worships a god mainly\nfor solace and peace of mind. People who suffer caste\nharassment and subjugation believe that god or religion can\ngive them some respite.\nThe directed graph given by this expert is as follows:\nR1\nR15\n\nR2\n\nR14\n\nR3\n\nR13\n\nR4\n\nR12\n\nR5\n\nR11\n\nR6\n\nR10\n\nR7\nR8\n\nR9\n\nFIGURE 2.1.1\n\nThe related connection matrix R is as follows\n\n50\n\n\fR1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 R11R12R13R14R15\nR1 \u23a10\nR 2 \u23a2\u23a21\nR 3 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR 4 \u23a20\nR 5 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR 6 \u23a21\nR 7 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR 8 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR 9 \u23a20\nR10 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR11 \u23a20\nR12 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR13 \u23a20\nR14 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nR15 \u23a2\u23a30\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\u23a4\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\u23a5\u23a6\n\nR is a 15 \u00d7 15 matrix. The analysis only uses simple FCMs.\nIf we pass on the state vector X = (1 0 0 0 0 ... 0), where all\nthe nodes are in the OFF state, except the attribute R1\n(religion) we see the effect of the state vector X on the\ndynamical system R\nXR\nX1 R\n\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) =\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) =\n\nX1\nX1\n\nThe symbol 'J' denotes the resultant of XR after\nthresholding and updating the vector. Thus when the\nconcept or the attribute 'religion' alone is in the ON state we\nsee all other attributes come to the ON state. Thus the hidden\npattern of the dynamical system states that the religion\n(here, Hindu Brahminical religion) induces on people the\nsuperstition, caste system, untouchability, psychological\noppression, discrimination of all forms, Varnashrama\nDharma, social fear and so on. Thus, as per this expert we\ncan say what Periyar said was correct: Don't follow any\n\n51\n\n\freligion, particularly Hinduism that is nothing but\nVarnashrama Dharma (caste system). That is why the SelfRespect Movement founded by Periyar fought against the\noppressive interlinked concepts of religion and god.\nThus it is clear from the dynamical system, religion as\ngiven by Manu Smriti, Vedas, Gita and so on is the root\ncause of all discrimination, under-development and unrest\nprevailing in the nation. Dalits and Backward classes\n(Sudras) lead a life of insecurity, fear, segregation, and\ndiscrimination. Majority of them live below the poverty\nline, without even proper school education, no proper\noccupation, work over ten hours a day. The atrocities\ncommitted against the dalits shows the worst side of Hindu\nreligion.\nAs suggested by the expert we analyze the state vector\nY = (0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) i.e., only the node\nuntouchability is in the ON state and all other nodes are in\nthe OFF state. We study the hidden pattern given by the\nvector Y on the dynamical system R.\nYR\nY1 R\nY2 R\n\nJ\nJ\n=\n\n(1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nY2.\n\n=\n=\n\nY1\nY2\n\nThus when the node untouchability is in the ON state all\nother nodes becomes ON just like the earlier example. This\nshows that the practice of untouchability is the cause of all\nproblems and humiliations.\nSuppose we consider the node 'caste system' to be in\nthe ON state and all other nodes remain in the OFF state we\nobtain the state vector Z = (0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0).\nThe effect of Z on R gives\nZR\nZ1 R\nZ2 R\nZ3 R\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0)\n(1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nZ3\n\nleading to a fixed point.\n\n52\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nZ1 (say)\nZ2 (say)\nZ3 (say)\n\n\fThe hidden pattern of the state vector when caste\nsystem is in the ON state makes all other nodes come to the\nON state. Thus the caste system is sufficient to ruin the\nnation.\nOn the other hand if the node 'faith in religion' is in the\nON state i.e., we obtain the following fixed point\nA\nAR\n\n=\nJ\n\n(0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n(0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n\n=\n\nA.\n\nThus 'faith in religion' does not have any impact on the\nsocial setup. Likewise we can study any node.\nTake the state vector B = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\ni.e., the node 'psychological oppression', to be in the ON\nstate and all other nodes are in the OFF state. Consider the\neffect of B on R.\nBR\nB1R\nB2R\nB3R\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0)\n(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0)\n(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0)\n(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0)\n\n= B1 (say)\n= B2 (say)\n= B3 (say)\n= B4(= B3 say)\n\nWe see that 'psychological oppression' makes social\nfear and social binding and related factors to come to the ON\nstate.\nThe same type of analysis can be carried out by taking\none or several set of nodes in the ON state and analyze them.\nWe have used a C-program to analyze the various\nconcepts related to this directed graph. For C-program refer\n[69, 76]. Detailed conclusions are given in the final chapter.\nWe analyze another expert's opinion for the same\nattribute viz. Untouchability and Hindu religion.

According to this\nexpert, Samadharma3 increases with the annihilation\n(decrease) of the caste system.\nWe shall see the effect of the state vectors on the\ndynamical system P.\nLet X = (1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) be the state vector which\ndepicts the ON state of the node 'religious cruelty' and all\nother nodes are in the OFF state. Effect of X on P is given by\nXP\nX1P\n\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n\nX1 (say).\nX2 (say).\n\nClearly X1 = X2. Thus religious cruelty is the root cause of\nall factors like untouchability, caste system, Manu Dharma,\nVarnashrama Dharma, social inequality and psychological\noppression.\nThus religious cruelty is the basis for all disturbances,\ndistrust, discrimination, desperateness, divisions and\ndepressions in society. It has forced them to seek means to\nprotect themselves from further harassment by taking refuge\nin atheism. Naturally they defy religion so that the cruel\nclutches of religion are released and an atheist feels that at\nleast he is liberated.\nLikewise Samadharma also works as an antidote for\nVarnashrama Dharma and Manu Dharma. After a prolonged\ndiscussion about Hinduism this expert, a Periyarist changed\nthe node religion to religious cruelty.\nConsider the node Samadharma alone in the ON state\nand all other nodes in the OFF state.\nY\nYP\n\n= (0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0)\n= (0 0 \u20131 1 \u20131 1 1 1 \u20131)\nJ (0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0)\n=\n\n3\n\nY1 (say)\n\nAccording to Periyar, the concept of Samadharma or\negalitarianism was postulated as an alternative to Manudharma\nand the Varnashrama Dharma. This word gained currency when\nhe founded the Self Respect Movement.\n\n55\n\n\fY1 P\nY2 P\nY3P\n\nJ\nJ\n=\n\n(1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nY3.\n\n=\n=\n\nY2 (say)\nY3 (say)\n\nThis gives a fixed point, which converts all other nodes to\nthe ON state. So the node Samadharma has a very positive\nimpact. When it is in the ON state it destroys religious\ncruelty, untouchability, caste system and Varnashrama\nDharma. Samadharma supports atheism, breaks social\ninequality and psychological oppression, thereby all states\nare activated.\nNext we study the effect of social inequality on the\nsystem P.\nLet us take the state vector\nZ = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0)\nwhich has only social inequality in the ON state and all\nother nodes in the OFF state. The effect of Z on the\ndynamical system P is given by\nZP\nZ1 P\nZ2 P\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1) =\n(0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) =\n(0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) =\n\nZ1 (say).\nZ2 (say)\nZ2 .\n\nWe arrive at the fixed point. The effect of social inequality\non the system turns the nodes Varnashrama Dharma, Manu\nDharma and psychological oppression to ON state.\nAccording to this dynamical system, social inequality\ncauses psychological oppression and these are caused due to\nManu Dharma and Varnashrama Dharma.\nSeveral other experts' opinions are taken for our study\nand it's modeled in the form of connection matrices. A\nthorough analysis of the inter-relation between attributes is\ngiven in the final chapter.\nFor these same 9 concepts we got the opinion of the\nsame expert using Neutrosophic Cognitive Map (NCM),\nwhere he has the option to state if certain relationships\ngiven in the graph are indeterminate.\n\n56\n\n\fThe neutrosophic directed graph is as follows:\n\nP1\nP2\n\nP9\n\nP8\n\nP3\n\nP7\n\nP4\n\nP6\n\nP5\nFIGURE 2.1.3\n\nThe related connection matrix is given by P'.\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\nP6\nP7\nP8\nP9\n\nP1\n\u23a10\n\u23a21\n\u23a2\n\u23a20\n\u23a2\n\u23a20\n\u23a20\n\u23a2\n\u23a20\n\u23a21\n\u23a2\n\u23a20\n\u23a20\n\u23a3\n\nP2 P3 P4 P5\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\nP6\n1\n0\n0\n\nP7\n1\n0\n0\n\nP8\n1\n0\n1\n\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\n\n0 \u22121 1 \u22121 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 I\n\nP9\n1\u23a4\n1 \u23a5\u23a5\n1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1\u23a5\n1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u22121\u23a5\n\u22121\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1\u23a5\n0 \u23a5\u23a6\n\nConsider the state vector Z' = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0) on the\nneutrosophic matrix P'. We see the resultant remains the\nsame. One can work with any other state vector and derive\nconclusions.\n\n57\n\n\f2.2 Analysis of discrimination faced by Dalits/ Sudras in the\nfield of education as untouchables using FCMs and NCMs\n\nIn this section, we discuss the denial of education to Dalits\nand Backward classes. The literacy rate of Dalits is much\nlower compared to the general population. This expert says\nthat the Brahmins and caste-Hindus systematically deny\neducation to Dalits and Sudras right from school to\nprofessional levels. Dalits and Sudras are harassed,\ntormented, and driven away from their professions.\nIn the Manusmriti it was decreed that if Sudras were\ngoing to even hear the Vedas (the holy texts of the\nBrahmins) being uttered, molten lead had to be poured into\ntheir ears as a punishment. The expert quoted Jotirao Phule4\nwho spoke of how the Dalit and Sudras were actively\ndenied education by the Brahminical orthodoxy, deduces:\n\"Without knowledge, intelligence was lost, without\nintelligence, morality was lost and without morality was lost\nall dynamism! Without dynamism, money was lost and\nwithout money the Sudras sank. All this misery was caused\nby the lack of knowledge.\"\nOur expert also quoted Periyar who had said that even\nduring the British and Congress rule, the Dalit and Sudra\nchildren were denied entry into certain schools. For\ninstance, even today in villages Dalit children are\nsegregated and made to sit apart in the classroom. In\neducational institutions run by Hindu religious leaders like\nthe Sankaracharya, Brahmin and non-Brahmin college\nstudents are given different types of food and statewide\nagitations took place against it. [88]\nIt goes without saying how much discrimination and\nintellectual harassment they undergo in classrooms and\ncollege premises. So we are justified in mathematically\nanalyzing the problem faced by Dalits and Sudras in\neducation, which we have broadly classified as educational\n4\n\nPhule (1827 -1890) the earliest pioneer of the non-Brahmin\nmovement in India established the Satyashodhak Samaj (the\nsociety of seekers of the Truth).\n\n58\n\n\funtouchability. Since the attributes chosen by different\nexperts is different the notion of Combined Fuzzy Cognitive\nMaps (CFCMs) cannot be applied to this model.\nFurther, the expert opinion (unsupervised data) is full of\nsensitive, rationalist feeling not based on any science/ law.\nSo we are justified in using fuzzy theory to study it. The\nattributes given by this expert as the causes of educational\nuntouchability or educational discrimination is as follows.\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE6\nE7\nE8\nE9\nE10\n\n-\n\nDiscrimination in education\nVarnashrama Dharma\nManu Dharma\nSamadharma\nFear of studies/ harassment by high caste teachers\nDiscouragement to read/study\nRole of Brahmins and caste-Hindus\nUntouchability\nEconomic condition\nSocial condition\n\nThe associated directed graph given by this expert.\nE1\nE10\n\nE2\n\nE9\n\nE3\n\nE8\n\nE4\n\nE7\n\nE5\nE6\nFIGURE 2.2.1\n\n59\n\n\fThe related connection matrix for the above directed graph\nis given by E\nE1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10\nE1 \u23a10\nE 2 \u23a2\u23a20\nE 3 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nE 4 \u23a20\nE \u23a20\nE = 5 \u23a2\nE 6 \u23a20\nE 7 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nE 8 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nE 9 \u23a20\nE10 \u23a2\u23a30\n\n1 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 1 0\n1 0 0\n1 1 0\n0 0 0\n\n1 1 1 1 1\u23a4\n1 1 1 1 1 0\u23a5\u23a5\n1 1 1 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u2212 1 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n0 0 1 1 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 0 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n1 1 0 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 1 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 1 0 0 0\u23a5\n1 0 1 0 1 0\u23a5\u23a6\n1\n\nNow we take the vector X = (1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), i.e., only\ndiscrimination in education is in the ON state and all other\nnodes are in the OFF state. The effect of X on the dynamical\nsystem E is given by\nXE\nX1E\nX2E\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nX1 (say)\nX2 (say)\nX2\n\nwhich is clearly a fixed point. We see from the hidden\npattern of the dynamical system that discrimination in\neducation is due to Manu Dharma, Varnashrama Dharma,\nuntouchability, Fear of studies/ harassment by high caste\nteachers, role of Brahmins and caste Hindus,\ndiscouragement to read/study, economic and social\ncondition. Thus the notion of Samadharma becomes ON to\nfight against the discrimination in education.\nNext we take the state vector Y = (0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0),\nwhere the only node which is ON is the 'Fear of studies/\nharassment by high caste teachers' and all other nodes are in\nthe OFF state. We study the effect of Y on E\n\n60\n\n\fYE\nY1E\nY2E\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1)\n(1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nY1 say\nY2 (say).\nY2 .\n\nWe see that when 'fear of studies/ harassment by high caste\nteachers' is in the ON state, it causes discouragement in\neducation and so on.\nNow we work with the node 'untouchability' alone in\nthe ON state and all other nodes are in the OFF state. Let us\ndenote the state vector by Z = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0).\nThe effect of Z on the dynamical system E is given by\nZE\nZ1E\nZ2E\nZ3E\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1)\n(1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nZ1 (Say)\nZ2 (say)\nZ3 (say)\nZ3 .\n\nJust the effect of untouchability is highly cruel in the\ncontext of discrimination in education. The ON state of\nSamadharma is the only positive attribute which has forced\nthem to fight against both the imposition of untouchability\nand the discrimination in education. Since all the concepts/\nnodes given by the experts are tightly interlinked, we see\nthat the ON state of any of the node makes all the other\nnodes to ON state, leading to a fixed point. Moreover, it is\nimportant to note that in no place in the model is the hidden\npattern a limit cycle. In the expert's opinion a recurrence of\nnodes as a limit cycle is impossible.\nThe reader may be under the assumption that the talk of\ndiscrimination in education is an exaggeration. However,\nthis is not so. Even in the days of Periyar, in the Presidency\nCollege in Chennai, Mr. Namachivaya, a teacher of Tamil\nwith several years experience could only earn a salary of\nRs.80 per month. On the other hand, a Brahmin Kuppusamy\nSastrigal, who was a Sanskrit teacher in the same college,\nand had lesser experience than the Tamil pundit would get\nRs.400/- per month. That was one instance of the\nwidespread discrimination faced by the Sudras and Dalits in\nthe hands of the Brahmins. This is prevalent even today.\n\n61\n\n\fThis expert was asked if any of the interrelations given in\nthe directed graphs could be indeterminate. So we obtained\nthe following neutrosophic directed graph from the expert.\nE1\nE10\n\nE2\n\nE9\n\nE3\n\nE8\n\nE4\n\nE7\n\nE5\nE6\nFIGURE 2.2.2\n\nThe related connection matrix of the neutrosophic directed\ngraph is as follows:\nE1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10\nE1 \u23a10\nE 2 \u23a2\u23a20\nE 3 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nE 4 \u23a20\nE \u23a20\nE= 5 \u23a2\nE 6 \u23a20\nE 7 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nE 8 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nE 9 \u23a20\nE10 \u23a2\u23a30\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1\u23a4\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\u23a5\u23a5\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 I 0 \u2212 1 0 0 I 0 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\u23a5\u23a6\n1 1 0\n\n62\n\n\fIt can easily be seen that if the node Samadharma is in ON\nstate, all other nodes are in the OFF state. We see using\nNeutrosophic Cognitive Maps several of the relations are\nindeterminate, it is in fact acceptable and in keeping with\nthe ON state of the node E4.\nNext we study another expert's opinion. It was more\ndiverse and had greater number of attributes dealing with\nuntouchability practiced in education. The attributes given\nby this expert are:\n1. Discrimination in Education\n2. Untouchability\n3. Role of Brahmins as heads of most institutions of\nimportance and higher learning\n4. Certain fields of education are unapproachable for\nDalits and Sudras\n5. Differences practiced in delivering education\n(discrimination)\n6. Discrimination in school education\n7. Discrimination in college education\n8. Discrimination in law education\n9. Discrimination in medical education\n10. Discrimination in arts like music and dance\n11. Discrimination in acting/ drama schools\n12.

Employment in educational institutions of national\nimportance\n\n63\n\n\f23. Fear of learning due to discrimination and ill\ntreatment\n24. Partiality or discrimination in valuation of Dalits and\nSudras answer scripts\n25. Role of present day government\nThis expert is an educationalist who had been in the field of\neducation/teaching and administration for over 5 decades.\nShe is also a Periyarist and held discussions with us for\nmany days on this topic of untouchability in education.\nDuring these discussions, astonishingly, she gave us over 30\nattributes. We told her our inability to work with such a big\nnumber as 30. She hesitatingly reduced it to 25; we felt it\nimpossible to argue with her or make compromise over our\nviews. She offered to give reasons, so we had no other\noption other than to accept her views.\nMany of the attributes have already been described;\nhence we proceed on to describe the new nodes in a brief\nmanner to avoid repetition.\nShe says that Brahmins occupy most higher, powerful\nposts and hence oppress Dalits and Sudras. Brahmins\ngrossly dominate certain fields, so it is unapproachable for\nthe oppressed sections of society.\nShe explains that 'differences are practiced in delivering\neducation' in the following way: Education delivered in a\nprimary school in a rural area (where majority of the\nstudents are from Dalit and backward communities) is far\nlow in standard when compared to the education given in\nposh urban schools, where the children of elites and upper\ncastes study. This is more emphasized in the case of\nelementary and secondary education. In rural schools, there\nare no proper teachers, no space, no infrastructure and\nabove all, no motivation for education is provided to the\nDalit and Sudra children in contrast with the city schools.\nAbove all the medium of instruction for all these children is\nonly Tamil. Unfortunately, these rural Dalit and Sudra\nchildren have to compete in public examinations with the\nwell-educated Brahmin and upper caste and answer the\nsame set of questions at the 10th and 12th standards.\n\n64\n\n\fAt times, Dalit and Sudra students find it difficult to\nenter any professional course: engineering, medicine, law or\narchitecture. At times, even if they qualify for a professional\ncourse by sheer merit and hard work, they are unable to pay\nthe high fees. Also, in some cases, they student find it very\ndifficult to cope with the English medium of instruction.\nAnother sad thing to be noted is that these students are illtreated and harassed not only by their teachers for their\nignorance in English but also by their own classmates. The\nteachers are also indifferent to the problems faced by\nstudents from these marginalized backgrounds, and they\ndon't try to give them a proper orientation.\nAccording to our expert, this is also prevalent in every\nvocation and occupation such as law, medicine, acting and\nperforming arts, science and technology, etc. She spoke\nabout the cultural richness of these subjugated communities\nand how the Brahmins appropriated it.\nIn institutes of higher education, there is no reservation\nfor Dalits and Sudras for doing research. Even granted there\nis some arbitrary reservation, the harassment they are made\nto undergo is so terrible that some of the students don't\ncomplete the course in the stipulated period; some do\nresearch for over several years together, become averse and\nquit. The reason behind this is absence of solid\nrepresentation of Sudras and Dalits as teachers or research\nguides in these institutes.\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Dalit and Sudra students are also\neasily picked up and are made victims of discrimination,\nbecause majority of them are dark complexioned. So colour\nstands as an easy recognition of caste by the upper castes\nand Brahmins. So they are discriminated at the places of\nlearning. This expert states that there is partiality in the\nvaluation of answer scripts of Dalit and Sudra students.\nFinally, the expert also pointed out that none of the\nGovernment policies of education had succeeded in\nreaching out to the lower strata of society.\nSince this expert insisted on the 25 attributes and was\nagainst lessening it, working with a 25 \u00d7 25 matrix and a\ngraph with 25 nodes was very complicated. So we took the\n\n65\n\n\flinks and worked with it using the pseudo code in C\nlanguage [69, 76]. The data given by her was fed in the\nform of the program and several results were derived. These\nare ingrained in our chapter on conclusions.\nAs our expert quickly grasped the concept of NCM, she\nobliged us by working with NCMs. We noted the related\nmatrix. When the state vector 'discrimination in school\neducation' alone was in the ON state we found the resultant\nhad four nodes viz. 10, 14, 16 and 19 were in the OFF state\nand the nodes 15, 20, 23 and 24 were in the indeterminate\nstate. The rest of the nodes came to ON state.\n2.3 Social inequality faced by Dalits and some of the most\nbackward classes - an analysis using FCM and NCM\n\nThe third major attribute taken for our analysis is social\nuntouchability. Everywhere in India, the Dalits are made to\nlive in separate settlements called the cheri or basti on the\noutskirts of the village oor or gram. So, India itself is\ndivided. This concept has been described earlier in p.48 of\nthis book. Social inequality is also gruesomely displayed in\ncaste riots and atrocities. According to a ten-year-old\nstatistics from the Government of India: \"On an average\nday, two Dalits are killed, three Dalit women are raped,\ntwo Dalit houses are burned and 50 Dalits are assaulted\nby caste-Hindus.\" This is just the tip of the iceberg.

This shows\nthat if there is social inequality in the national set-up all\nother nodes become ON signifying the role of Manu\nDharma, untouchability so on and so forth.\n\n68\n\n\fWe take state vector Y = (0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\ni.e., only the node 'Brahmin or caste Hindu arrogance' is in\nthe ON state and all other nodes are OFF, we see the effect of\nY on the dynamical system S.\nYS\nY1S\nY2S\n\nJ (1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1) = Y1 (say)\nJ (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) = Y2 (say)\nJ (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) = Y2 .\n\nThis also gives a fixed point as hidden pattern. Thus caste\nHindu/ Brahmin arrogance is sufficient to ruin the society\nentailing in social inequality, social discrimination and so\non and so forth. Unless the oppressor castes and Brahmins\ncorrect themselves it would certainly ruin the nation. Power\nand money are concentrated in the hands of a few elites\nbelonging to Brahmin and 'upper' castes. Over 70% of the\npeople are Dalits and Sudras who suffer due to poverty,\nlandlessness, and inferior social status.\nSuppose the node 'poor economic conditions of the\nmajority of Dalits and Sudras' and the node that they are\n'not policy makers' is in the 'ON' state, we study the effect\nof it on the dynamical system i.e. on our society; even if all\nother nodes are in the OFF state.\nLet P = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1). The effect of P\non the dynamical system is:\nPS\nP1 S\nP2 S\nP3 S\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1)\n(1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nP1 say\nP2 say\nP3 say\nP3 .\n\nThus the hidden pattern is a fixed point, which makes all\nstates ON in the resultant state vector. This shows that the\nattribute that they are not policy makers coupled with poor\neconomic conditions makes all other states ON showing\nonce again the importance of the fact that unless they\n\n69\n\n\fimprove economically and become policy makers it would\nbe impossible to see any radical change in their lifestyle.\nTo be more precise, their social and economic\nconditions are spiraling downward with the advent of\nglobalization and privatization. Several other aspects were\nanalyzed using FCM and we arrived at conclusions given in\nthe final chapter of this book.\nWe informed the expert that now we give him the\noption to introduce indeterminates in his associations or\nrelations. Consequently, some relationships were marked as\nbeing indeterminate.\nThe following neutrosophic graph, represented by\nfigure 2.3.2, was obtained:\n\nT1\nT17\n\nT2\nT3\n\nT16\nT15\n\nT4\n\nT14\n\nT5\n\nT13\n\nT6\n\nT12\n\nT7\nT11\n\nT8\nT10\n\nT9\n\nFIGURE 2.3.2\n\nThe related neutrosophic matrix is given in the next page.\n\n70\n\n\fT1\nT1 \u23a10\nT2 \u23a2\u23a20\nT3 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT4 \u23a2 0\nT5 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT6 \u23a21\nT7 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT8 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT9 \u23a20\nT10 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT11 \u23a20\nT12 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT13 \u23a21\nT14 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT15 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nT16 \u23a20\nT17 \u23a2\u23a30\n\nT2\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT3\n1\n1\n0\n0\nI\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT4\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT5\n1\n1\nI\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT6\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT7\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT8\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nT9 T10 T11 T12 T13 T14 T15 T16 T17\n1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1\u23a4\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 I 1\u23a5\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1\u23a5\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\u23a6\n\nThe resultant shows T3 and T6 are indeterminates. When\nnode T7 alone is in ON state, in the resultant vector T14 is in\nindeterminate state and all other nodes become ON.\nNext, we get the second expert's opinion on the same\ntopic. The nodes given by this expert are as follows:\nManu Dharma\nVarnashrama Dharma\nMonopoly of power by Brahmins and caste Hindus\nReligious belief\nSocial discrimination\nCaste discrimination\nEconomic condition\nNo access to power\nGovernment has no concern about Dalits /Sudras; has\nconcern about privatization and globalization\nK10 - Social disrespect based on their caste\nK1\nK2\nK3\nK4\nK5\nK6\nK7\nK8\nK9\n\n-\n\n71\n\n\fK11\nK12\nK13\nK14\nK15\n\n-\n\nFear of losing livelihood / job\nJudiciary monopolized by Brahmins / caste Hindu\nGovernment reforms do not reach grassroots\nLandless labourers\nNo facility for education / economic improvement\n\nThis expert feels that socio-economic status of Dalits and\nSudras can never be improved until they become policy\nmakers. Their status will remain the same; Brahmins and\n'upper' caste Hindus and the government is indirectly the\ncause of such treachery.\nThis expert has given a very dense directed graph,\nwhich as follows\nK1\nK15\n\nK2\n\nK14\n\nK3\n\nK13\n\nK4\n\nK12\n\nK5\n\nK11\n\nK6\n\nK10\n\nK7\nK8\n\nK9\n\nFIGURE 2.3.3\n\nThe related connection matrix is a 15 \u00d7 15 matrix which\nwe denote by L.\n\n72\n\n\fK1\nK 1 \u23a10\nK 2 \u23a2\u23a20\nK 3 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nK 4 \u23a21\nK 5 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nK 6 \u23a21\nK 7 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nK 8 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nK 9 \u23a20\nK 10 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nK 11 \u23a20\nK 12 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nK 13 \u23a20\nK 14 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nK 15 \u23a3\u23a21\n\nK2 K3 K4\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\n0 0 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 1 0\n\nK5 K6 K7\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nK8 K9 K10 K11K 12K 13 K 14K 15\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\u23a4\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\u23a5\u23a5\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\u23a5\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u23a5\u23a6\n\nWe study the effect of any state vector on the dynamical\nsystem using L.

It is clear that the attribute social\ndiscrimination has forced all the attributes to become ON.\nThe main points are: government has no concern over their\nliving conditions, no budgetary plans ever reach them and\nso on. Each factor represents negative effect of social\ndiscrimination practiced even today in full swing.\nLet Y be (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) where only the\nnode 'no access to power' is in the ON state and all nodes\n\n73\n\n\fare in the OFF state.

We proceed on\nto the next section.\n2.4 Problems faced by Dalits in the political arena due to\ndiscrimination \u2013 a FCM and NCM analysis\n\nWe take the next major attribute, political untouchability.\nAlthough reservation exists for Dalits at every tier of the\npolitical systems, right from membership in local village\ngovernment (panchayat) to the parliament. Because it is a\nconstitutional obligation, this reservation is mostly filled.\nHowever real assertive candidates fail to get elected and the\ndummy dalit candidates out up by the major political parties\n\n75\n\n\fend up holding public office. Also, electoral violence\nagainst Dalit candidates is rampant and widespread. Those\nwho manage to get elected are also either puppets in the\nhands of caste Hindu forces, or they are finished off. Worst\ninstance of caste fanaticism against Dalit political assertion\nwas witnessed in the murder of Melavalavu Murugesan and\nseven others on 30 June 1997, because they violated a caste\nHindu order that they must not contest the post of Panchayat\nPresident. All over India, in several places elections in\ngrassroots level bodies (panchayat) are not allowed to take\nplace because these seats have been reserved for dalits (like\nin Pappapatti and Keeripatti). In fact, in the Tamil Nadu\nState cabinet, there is only one Dalit minister and he is in\ncharge of dalit welfare.

Hence 'state-sponsored\natrocities' promotes political untouchability.\n\n78\n\n\fWe take the state vector Y = (0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0) where the node 'rule of caste Hindus and Brahmins'\nalone is in the ON state.

We see that\nthe effect of 'rule of caste Hindus and Brahmins' makes all\nnodes of the system under political untouchability come to\nON state.\nWe obtained similar results when we studied with only\nthe node A11 in the ON state. This conclusion is supported\nbased on documentary evidence. Violence against Dalits by\nthe partisan state machinery, particularly the police are\nhighly condemnable. Instigated by the ruling casteist forces,\nthey police launch planned attacks and ransack Dalit\nsettlements, foist false castes against Dalits, take the men\ninto arbitrary custody, beat them, and torture the women\nand children. There are several such instances that have\ntaken place in Tamil Nadu. For more, refer [65, 66].\nWhen the expert was given the option to use NCM, i.e.,\nthe neutrosophic model, the 16 \u00d7 16 relational matrix was\nmade into a neutrosophic matrix. When the node 'statesponsored atrocities' was alone in the ON state and all other\nnodes were in the OFF state it was found that in the resultant\nvector, the nodes 2, 7 and 10 become indeterminate.\nLikewise several state vectors were analyzed using NCM.\nNext we take another expert's opinion on political\nuntouchability. The attributes/ nodes that the expert\nassociated with the term \"political untouchability\" are:\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\n\n-\n\nPolitical discrimination\nPolitical ill treatment\nVarnashrama Dharma\nEconomic condition\n\n79\n\n\fS5\nS6\nS7\nS8\nS9\nS10\n\n-\n\nRole of caste\nRole of ruling party's caste votebank\nPolice atrocities on Dalits\nDalits prevented from voting\nDalits live under fear during election\nPolitical violence\n\nThe expert explained S10, the concept of political violence\nby speaking of the large scale electoral violence that takes\nplace in the country. Several lives have been lost in such\nmindless, casteist violence. Dalit settlements are burnt\nduring elections in order to terrify them and prevent them\nfrom casting their votes to a candidate of their choice. For\ninstances, please refer [65, 66].\nThis expert differentiates the two concepts political\ndiscrimination and political ill treatment. For instance, if a\nDalit who is elected as a Panchayat President faces a life\nthreat and the police do not give him adequate security, it is\nan evidence of political discrimination. If an elected Dalit\nPanchayat President is not allowed to sit on a chair during\nmeetings, and is instead asked to sit on the floor, or if he is\nabused by his caste name, then it is an evidence of political\nill treatment.\nThough we feel that political discrimination and ill\ntreatment has very subtle difference, this expert wants to\nconsider them as separate attributes. This expert views that\nthe political discrimination is one of the causes for police\natrocities on Dalits. If there was reasonable representation\nof Dalits in the ruling party certainly the state-sponsored\npolice atrocities on these innocent Dalits can be prevented\nto a large extent.\nThe expert says if Dalits were economically powerful,\ncertainly they will not become victims of such atrocities,\nand they would automatically find representation in power\nsharing and they would become politically empowered.\nHe says the role of caste is directly dependent on the\nruling party's caste votebank. He is of the opinion that in\nIndia caste plays a major destructive role!\n\n80\n\n\fThe directed graph given by the expert is as follows:\nS1\nS10\n\nS2\n\nS9\n\nS3\n\nS8\n\nS4\n\nS7\n\nS5\nS6\nFIGURE 2.4.2\n\nThe connection matrix related to this directed graph is\ndenoted by Q which is a 10 \u00d7 10 matrix.\nS1\nS1 \u23a10\nS 2 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nS3 \u23a2 1\n\u23a2\nS4 \u23a20\nS5 \u23a2 1\n\u23a2\nS6 \u23a21\nS7 \u23a2 0\n\u23a2\nS8 \u23a2 1\nS9 \u23a2\u23a21\nS10 \u23a2\u23a30\n\nS2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\u23a4\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 \u23a5\u23a5\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\u23a5\n0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u23a5\u23a5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u23a5\u23a6\n\n81\n\n\fWe consider the state vector X = (0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0)\nwhere the node 'role of ruling party's caste votebank' is in\nthe ON state and all other attributes are in the OFF state.

This shows that the role of ruling party's\ncaste votebank plays a vital role in political untouchability.\nWe study the same dynamical system Q with another\nstate vector T = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0), where only the node\n'Dalits live under fear during election time' is in the ON\nstate and all other nodes are in the OFF state.

All nodes are in the ON state in the\nresultant vector. This implies that when Dalits live under\nfear during elections, they are denied even the democratic\nright to vote for a candidate of their choice.\nThe expert says that invariably the ruling party rowdies,\nwho take the situation near polling booth under their\ncontrol, cast dalit votes. Thus political violence is the result\nof political untouchability. If the ruling party realizes this\nand keeps in mind that the nation is to be democratically\nruled, certainly the concept of political discrimination and\nhence, political untouchability would be wiped off. The\nundue influence of religion, and particularly communalism\nin politics has been one of the factors that established caste\nas the prime player in politics.\nThis expert also suggested communal representation, as\nan alternative to the current existing system. He pointed out\nthat this would limit the dominance by the various\noppressor castes.\n\n82\n\n\f2.5 Study of Economic Status of Dalits due to untouchability\nusing fuzzy and neutrosophic analysis\n\nAccording to this expert the term economic untouchability\nmeans that Brahmins and caste-Hindus have prevented\nDalits and Ssudras from gaining economic development\nbecause of practicing the religious taboo of untouchability.\nSince majority of Dalits live as landless agricultural\nlabourers, they are economically downtrodden. They form\nthe largest section of the unorganized sector of labourers.\nTheir dismal representation in higher-income jobs is also\nreflective of their economic status. Dalits form the greatest\nshare of those living below the poverty line. The expert also\nquoted Dr.B.R.Ambedkar to trace the history of economic\nsubjugation of the Dalits.\nNext, a major observation made by the expert was about\nthe neo-economic policies of liberalization, globalization\nand privatization that has further robbed the Dalit people\nand left them much poorer.\nHe also described that bonded labour (rice-mills, brickmaking and several small-scale industries etc.) still existed\nin several pockets of Tamil Nadu and almost all its victims\nwere Dalits and most backward classes.\nEconomic boycott was a visible manifestation of\neconomic untouchability. During caste riots in villages, the\ncaste-Hindus refuse to hire Dalits to work on their lands,\nthey refuse to sell provisions to Dalits, and thus utilize\neconomic embargo as a tool of oppression.\nNext, the expert began to criticize the concept of\nreservation for economically backward people? He says that\nit is clear-cut method to give reservation to the Brahmins.\nOver 95% of the poor people are only Dalits and Sudras.\nHardly 0.001% of the Brahmin community could be living\nbelow the poverty line.\nThus according to this expert, economic untouchability\nmeans economic discrimination, economic backwardness,\nabsence of economic self-sufficiency and so on. The expert\nfeels that the major reason for economic untouchability lies\nin the four factors religious untouchability, political\n\n83\n\n\funtouchability, social untouchability and educational\nuntouchability.\nThe attributes given by this expert are:\nF1\nF2\nF3\nF4\nF5\nF6\nF7\nF8\nF9\nF10\nF11\nF12\n\n-\n\nEconomic discrimination\nVarnashrama Dharma\nCaste system\nPolitical power in the hands of caste Hindus\nNo proportion between labour and pay\nState apathy towards their economic plight\nBelief in destiny / karma\nLack of political power\nPoor social status\nNo education\nPolicy makers are not Dalits/ Sudras\nNo planning for income generation activities\n\nWe now give the directed graph of this expert.\nF1\nF2\n\nF12\nF11\n\nF3\n\nF4\n\nF10\n\nF5\n\nF9\nF8\n\nF6\nF7\nFIGURE 2 5 1\n\n84\n\n\fThe related connection matrix of the directed graph is as\nfollows:\nF1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 F10 F11 F12\nF1 \u23a1 0\nF2 \u23a2\u23a21\nF3 \u23a2 0\n\u23a2\nF4 \u23a2 0\nF5 \u23a2 0\n\u23a2\nF6 \u23a2 0\nF7 \u23a2 0\n\u23a2\nF8 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nF9 \u23a21\nF10 \u23a2 0\n\u23a2\nF11 \u23a21\nF12 \u23a3\u23a2 0\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\u23a4\n1 \u23a5\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n1\u23a5\n0 \u23a5\u23a6\n\nLet S denote the 12 \u00d7 12 matrix.

Unless the caste system is abolished; there\ncan be no improvement in the economic conditions for\neconomic discrimination will be at its peak.\n\n85\n\n\fNext we consider the state vector Y = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0) where the node 'lack of political power' alone in the\nON state and all the other nodes are in the OFF state.\nThe effect of the state vector Y on the dynamical\nsystem S is given by\nYS\nY1 S\nY2 S\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nY1 (say)\nY2 (say)\nY2 (say).\n\nThe hidden pattern results in a fixed point. Thus we see that\n'lack of political power' has not only made Dalits and\nSudras economically poor and economic untouchables but\nalso made them to be socially discriminated and suffer\nsocio-economic problems.\nNext, we take the state vector Z where the node 'No\neducation' is alone in the ON state of the node and all the\nother nodes are in the OFF state.\nThe effect of Z = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0) on the\ndynamical system S is given by\nZS\nZ1S\nZ2S\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nZ2 .\n\n=\n=\n\nZ1 (say)\nZ2 (say)\n\nThis results in a fixed point.

If\ncaste is abolished, it could certainly make a drastic change\nin the economic, social and political conditions of Dalits\nand Sudras.\nThis expert has given the following directed graph\nusing these attributes.\nH1\nH15\n\nH2\n\nH14\n\nH3\n\nH13\n\nH4\n\nH12\n\nH5\n\nH11\n\nH6\n\nH10\n\nH7\nH8\n\nH9\nFIGURE: 2.5.3\n\nThe related 15 \u00d7 15 connection matrix W is given in the\nfollowing page:\n\n89\n\n\fH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7 H8 H9 H10 H11H12H13 H14H15\nH1 \u23a1 0\nH 2 \u23a2\u23a21\nH 3 \u23a20\n\u23a2\nH 4 \u23a20\nH 5 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nH 6 \u23a21\nH 7 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nH 8 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nH 9 \u23a20\nH10 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nH11 \u23a21\nH12 \u23a2 0\n\u23a2\nH13 \u23a21\nH14 \u23a21\n\u23a2\nH15 \u23a2\u23a3 0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\u23a4\n0 \u23a5\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n0\u23a5\n\u23a5\n0 \u23a5\u23a6\n\nNode H15 has no relation with all other nodes. The expert\nsays that once this is achieved it will put an end to economic\ndiscrimination; free Dalits and Sudras from oppression and\nnaturally working conditions will be improved and\nconsequently they will get education. The caste system will\ndie a natural death. It will also have an effect on the poverty\nalleviation schemes of the Government. If such individual\nself-realization comes upon the caste-Hindus and Brahmins,\nthere will be drastic change not only in the lives of\ndowntrodden communities but also positively reflect on the\nnation's progress. Systems of casteist exploitation of labour\nare so strongly ingrained that caste-Hindus, including\nBrahmins, refuse to think otherwise.\nWe obtain results using the 15 \u00d7 15 connection matrix,\nW. Let us consider the state vector X = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0) where the node 'constant fear of discrimination\nand ill-treatment' is in the ON state and all other nodes are\nin the OFF state.

As long as caste system exists in\nIndia it is certain that economic untouchability will be\npracticed.\nWhen we asked the expert to use neutrosophy he\nremarked the node H15 which he has purposefully included\nto show its independency over other nodes can be\ninterrelated with some of the nodes as an indeterminate. We\nsee the effect also is an indeterminate of the node H15 in\nmost of the cases.\nNow we proceed onto analyze the second expert whom\nwe felt was little different and innovative even in specifying\nthe nodes for economic untouchability which are as follows:\nS1 S2 S3 S4\nS5\nS6\nS7\n\n-\n\nS8 -\n\nEconomic inequality\nCaste system and its relation to economic status\n(Varnashrama Dharma)\nConcentration of wealth solely in the hands of\nBrahmins/upper castes\nNo political power\nLandlessness\nLack of education\nDomination by 'upper' castes in all fields of power\nand prosperity\nLess pay and more hours of work\n\n91\n\n\fS9 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14 -\n\nNo awareness among Dalits and Sudras (their job is\ndependent on their subjugation to caste-Hindus/\nBrahmins)\nExploitation by caste Hindus and Brahmins\nTerrorized from even demanding their rights by\n'upper' castes and Brahmins (as they would be\njobless)\nUndemocratic actions taken on Dalits on all issues\nby caste-Hindu/ Brahmin public and government\nUntouchability\nLegal codes of the Varnashrama Dharma\n\nThese attributes were defined as the main concepts related\nto the economic untouchability.

The node 'Dalits are landlessness' is in the ON\nstate, all other attributes are kept in the OFF state in X = (0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0).\nThe effect of the state vector X on the dynamical\nsystem N is given by\nXN\nX1N\nX2N\n\nJ (1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) =\nJ (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) =\nJ X2 .\n\nX1 (say)\nX2 (say)\n\nThis results in a fixed point. We see from the resultant state\nvector that when the node 'landlessness' is in the ON state,\nall other nodes like exploitation, less pay and more hours of\nwork, gradually becoming indebted to the landlords due to\npoverty resulting in bonded labour and so on come to the\nON state.\n\n93\n\n\fThis clearly shows that if the Government distributes land\nto the Dalits, it will certainly empower them in all aspects.\nAs per our expert, this will be a major step in putting an end\nto the economic exploitation faced by the Dalits.\nNext, we take the node 'concentration of wealth solely\nin the hands of Brahmins/upper castes' to be in the ON state\nand all other nodes remain in the OFF state. We study the\neffect of the ON state of this node on the dynamical system.\nLet Y = (0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0).\nThe effect of the state vector Y on the dynamical\nsystem N is given by\nYN\nY1N\n\nJ\nJ\n\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\n\n=\n=\n\nY1 (say)\nY2 (say).\n\nBy thresholding and updating, we get the Y2N = Y2,\nresulting in a fixed point.\nIn the resultant vector all the nodes are in the ON state.\nThus concentration of wealth solely in the hands of\nBrahmins/upper castes is sufficient to create and extend the\neconomic untouchability. All these concepts are very\nclosely linked and this is evident from the resultant vector.\nConsider T = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1) i.e., where the\nnode, 'Code of Varnashrama Dharma' alone is in the ON\nstate and all other nodes are in the OFF state. We now\nproceed on to study the effect of the state vector T on the\ndynamical system N.\nTN\nT1N\nT2N\n\nJ\nJ\n=\n\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1)\n(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nT2 (a fixed point).\n\n=\n=\n\nT1 (say)\nT2 (say)\n\nThus we see that if Varnashrama Dharma alone is in the\nstate, all other nodes come to the ON state. Thus it is\nevidently seen that Varnashrama Dharma alone is sufficient\nto ruin the lives of Dalits and the Sudras beyond any repair.\nIt is unfortunate, but true that even today the sad state of our\nnation is due to the practice of Varnashrama Dharma as a\nresult of which Dalits and the Sudras live a life of\n\nON\n\n94\n\n\fdiscrimination, poverty, constant fear of harassment and\ndegradation. Several other conclusions based on this study\nis given in the last chapter.\nThis expert declined to work with NCM saying that the\nconcepts were extremely obvious, and nothing was\nindeterminate in his opinion.\nNow we proceed on to take a few of the attributes,\ncommon in the study of all the five aspects of\nuntouchability viz., religious untouchability, political\nuntouchability,\nsocial\nuntouchability,\neducational\nuntouchability and finally the economic untouchability.

Effect of X on the dynamical system S is given by\nXS J (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1) = X1 (say)\nX1S J (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1) = X2 = X2\nis a fixed point. Thus Manu Dharma is the vital cause for all\nthe social evils and once it is taken to be in the ON state of\nall the other nodes come to the ON state, except\nSamadharma (equality). Thus we see that Manu Dharma\nand Samadharma are directly opposed to each other. Manu\nDharma is the root cause of all the 5 major aspects of\nuntouchability.\nNext we consider a state vector V = (1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) where only the node 'religious\nuntouchability' is in the ON state and all other nodes are in\nthe OFF state. We find the effect of V on the dynamical\nsystem S\n96\n\n\fVS J (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nV1S J (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1)\nV2S = V2 is a fixed point.\n\n= V1 (say)\n= V2 (say)\n\nX = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0) and XS J X.\nThus when the node N13, i.e. Samadharma alone is in the ON\nstate, the effect of this on the dynamical system gives the\nresultant vector to be the same. That is, all nodes remain in\nthe OFF state, which shows that all social evils are in OFF\nstate if Samadharma is alone ON.\nLikewise we see that each of the nodes, which we have\nconsidered are very intricate and important because they\ntotally affect all the other nodes. Conclusions based on the\nanalysis of this dynamical system S are given in the fourth\nchapter.\nIn all these Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, which basically\nwork with the aid of a connection matrix and the state\nvector, we have used C programme to determine the hidden\npattern of the dynamical system. [69, 76]\n2.6 Analysis of the social problem of untouchability using\nFuzzy Relational Maps\n\nWe use another special type of mathematical tool called\nFuzzy Relational Maps (FRMs). The main motivation for\nusing this model in the place of FCM is that in several\nmodels we had to work with 25 \u00d7 25 matrix or a 19 \u00d7 19\nmatrix but if we use FRMs wherever viable we can certainly\nreduce the 25 \u00d7 25 matrix into a m \u00d7 n matrix (m \u2260 n) with\nm + n = 25. This will reduce the cumbersome working of\nthe model. We use FRMs to study the Periyar's ideology\nand his social reform. The basic methods and movement by\nwhich Periyar fought against untouchability, denial of\ntemple entry etc, are taken as the domain space of the FRM.\nThe nodes of the domain space are given by\nP1\nP2\n\n-\n\nSamadharma\nSelf Respect Movement\n\n97\n\n\fP3\nP4\nP5\nP6\nP7\n\n-\n\nP8\nP9\n\n-\n\nP10 -\n\nTemple entry demonstration\nNon-Brahmin Movement\nDenial of existence of god\nDemonstrations against untouchability\nOpposition to denial of education for Dalits and\nSudras (Laws of Manu)\nAnnihilation of caste system\nReformation of villages against superstitions/\nrituals\nFight for communal representation\n\nThe range space nodes given by the expert are detailed\nbelow:\nR1\n\n-\n\nR2\nR3\nR4\n\n-\n\nR5\n\n-\n\nR6\n\n-\n\nR7\n\n-\n\nR8\n\n-\n\nR9 R10 R11 R12 -\n\nFight against domination of Brahmins in fields\nof education and administration\nProtest rule of Manu's Varnashrama Dharma\nStop the practice of untouchability\nAbandon Varnashrama Dharma (discrimination\nby birth and occupation)\nTo fight against denial of education to Sudras\nand Dalits\nFight against denial of land and property to\nDalits and Sudras\nFight against denial of temple entry and entry\ninto sanctum sanctorum of the temple\nDifference in food and place were food is\nserved for Dalits and Sudra children in\ncomparison with Brahmin children\nRight to use all public roads by Dalits\nFight against denial of right to use common\nwells and lakes by Dalits\nRights denied to Dalits to wear new clothes,\nand carry umbrellas\nRights denied to Dalits to sit or use slippers in\nthe presence of Brahmins or high castes even\ntoday in remote villages.\n\n98\n\n\fThe first expert assigned the above attributes for the domain\nspace and range space.

This is evident from the fact that not only where\nthey denied education in the ancient days according to the\ndictums of Manu Dharma, but even now they suffer because\nof denial of access to education. The education that Dalits\nand Sudras obtain is much lower in standard and nowhere in\n\n100\n\n\fcomparison with the education that upper-caste Brahmins\nreceive. Schools run for the Dalits and Sudras lack proper\ninfrastructure or well-qualified teachers. Similarly, the\ngreatest sections of dropouts in school education are from\nthe Dalit and Sudra communities. Majority of the Dalits and\nSudras who live below the poverty line cannot think of\neducating their children even up to the 5th standard. When\nthis attribute becomes ON it makes all attributes come to the\nON state.\nNow we see the effects of the attributes in the range\nspace; suppose we take Y = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ) i.e.\n\"right denied for the Dalits and Sudras to use common well\nand lakes\" to be in the ON state and all other nodes in the\nrange space are in the OFF state.

In the place of FRMs one can\nuse Neutrosophic Relational Maps (NRMs) and obtain\nresults.\nFrom our study and analysis of untouchability using\nfuzzy and neutrosophic logic we are surprised to see that\nalmost all the graphs were very densely related with arrows,\nwhich obviously shows that every social evil is strongly\nbonded with other social evils.\n\n102\n\n\fChapter Three\n\nPERIYAR'S BIOGRAPHY AND HIS\nVIEWS ON UNTOUCHABILITY\nThe first section of this chapter is a brief biography of\nPeriyar. For more details about his life and works refer [2],\n[87] and [96]. The second section contains excerpts from\nthe translated speeches and writings of Periyar that deal\nwith this opinion on Untouchability. Some statistics of the\natrocities against Dalits are given in the third and final\nsection.\n\n3.1 Life and Struggle of Periyar E. V. R.\n\n\"The enormous privileges given to Brahmins by the\nVedas were sacrosanct only as long as they went\nunchallenged. The challenge rose in the Tamil\ncountry like a whirlwind, spearheaded by an\niconoclast who questioned the Vedas and the gods\nas well. He took apparently extremist positions on\nsome issues, but the fundamental nature of the\nsocial revolution he wrought was clear even to its\nvictims. The political perspectives of Tamil Nadu\nand with it much of India, were altered with a\nseeming finality by Ramasamy Naicker. (18791973)\"\n- Makers of the Millennium, India 1000 to 2000,\nExpress Publications, Madurai.\nPeriyar Erode Venkata Ramasamy (17.9.1879 - 24.12.1973)\nwas a social revolutionary who influenced the politics of the\nsouth Indian state of Tamil Nadu for half a century. Periyar,\nliterally meaning a great man was an honorific prefix\nbestowed on him by the people of Tamil Nadu. He was\n\n103\n\n\fhailed by a UNESCO Award as 'the prophet of the new age,\nthe Socrates of south east Asia, father of the social reform\nmovement and arch enemy of ignorance, superstitions,\nmeaningless customs and base manners.'\nHe was the second son of Venkata (Naicker) and\nChinna Thayammal. They were a very affluent family; his\nfather was a popular, rich merchant known for his religious\nphilanthropy. Leaders like Motilal Nehru (father of\nJawaharlal Nehru, independent India's first Prime Minister)\nand Mahatma Gandhi have stayed at Periyar's ancestral\nhome in Erode. His school education stopped at the age of\nten, and he subsequently entered his father's trade. Even as\na small boy, he was naughty enough to question the\ncontradictions and illusions that existed in the mythologies\nnarrated by Brahmins. He married Nagammai in 1898. In\n1904, he renounced his family and went to Varanasi, a\nsacred Hindu pilgrimage town on the banks of the Ganga.\nThe insults and the differential treatment he faced, for not\nbeing a Brahmin, made him aware of the cruelty of caste.\nGiving up thoughts of renunciation, he returned to his\nhometown Erode, where his father gave him the trade\nrights. His business flourished and he became a well-known\nin Erode. In 1918, he formally entered public life by\nbecoming the Chairman of Erode Municipality. The British\nGovernment made him an honorary magistrate and he held\n29 honorary positions at that time in banks, libraries, war\nrecruitment committee, merchant associations, school\ncommittees etc. His friends P.Varadharajulu Naidu and C.\nRajagopalachari persuaded him to join the Indian National\nCongress led by Mohandas Gandhi. In 1919, he joined the\nCongress, and resigned all the public posts he held at that\ntime. He gave up his lucrative wholesale dealership in\ngrocery and agricultural products, and closed his newly\nbegun spinning mill. His annual income had been\nRs.20,000, a princely figure in those days where the price of\neight grams of gold was not even Rs.10.\nThe Congress policy of Prohibition of Liquor was\nconceived in Periyar's house in Erode during Gandhi's stay\nthere upon the request of Periyar's wife and sister. Gandhi\n\n104\n\n\fsubsequently announced that the Congress party men should\nundertake picketing in front of toddy shops throughout the\ncountry and urged the British Government to implement the\npolicy of liquor prohibition. Periyar wholeheartedly\nundertook the constructive programme - spreading the use\nof Khadi, picketing toddy shops, and boycotting the shops\nselling foreign cloth and eradication of untouchability. He\ncourted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode in\n1921. When his wife as well as his sister joined the\nagitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was\nforced to come to a compromise. When Congress frontline\nleaders requested Mahatma Gandhi to stop that agitation, he\nseriously told them that the decision of stopping the\nagitation was not in his own hands, but with two women in\nErode, implying Periyar's wife and sister.\nIn 1922, Periyar became the President of the Tamil\nNadu Congress Committee. At its provincial conference\nheld in Tirupur, he moved a resolution that urged people of\nall castes to be allowed to enter and worship in all the\ntemples, as a measure to end birth-based discrimination.\nCiting the authority of Vedas and other Hindu scriptures,\nBrahmin members of the Committee opposed the resolution\nand stalled its passage. This reactionary stand of the\nmembers of upper castes provoked Periyar to declare that he\nwould burn Manu Dharma Sastra, Ramayana etc. to show\nhis disapproval to accept such scriptures to govern the life\nof people.\nHis radical outlook enabled him to even support the\nprogressive policies of other parties such as the South\nIndian Liberation Federation (popularly, the Justice Party).\nThough he was a Congress leader, he welcomed the Justice\nParty's Act passed in the Madras State Legislative Council\nto form a Hindu Religious Endowment Board with a view\nto put an end to the age-old monopoly and exploitation of\nthe Brahmins in the managements of Hindu temples.\nLikewise, in 1924, he appreciated the Justice Party's\nGovernment Order to implement the policy of Communal\nRepresentation in education and employment.\n\n105\n\n\fIn the temple town of Vaikom in present day Kerala, the\nuntouchable and 'low' caste communities were prohibited\nfrom walking on the temple streets. The Congress Party\nthere began a peaceful agitation against it in 1924 and they\ninvited Periyar to take up the leadership of the movement.\nHe was sentenced twice to undergo imprisonment. The\nagitations went on for a year. Even Gandhi came to\nVaikom. Periyar's intense involvement granted the basic\ncivil right of using public roads to the 'low' castes and\nuntouchables. His courageous struggle earned him the\nhonour of being called the \"Hero of Vaikom.\"\nOut of the funds of the Tamil Nadu Congress\nCommittee (TNCC), they started the National Training\nSchool at Cheranmadevi near Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, as\nan alternative to those run by the British Government. It\nwas managed by a Brahmin, V.V.S. Iyer. In that school's\nhostel called Gurukulam, the Brahmin and non-Brahmin\nstudents were segregated. The Brahmin boys were treated in\na better manner with regard to food, shelter and education.\nAngered over this, Periyar resigned from the post of\nSecretary of the TNCC. He later put an end to this\ndiscriminatory practice. Periyar was later elected the\nPresident of the TNCC.\nSince 1920, he had attempted to move resolutions in the\nCongress\nconferences\ndemanding\nCommunal\nRepresentation for non-Brahmins in government jobs and\neducation. But the Brahmins systematically defeated it:\nconferences in Tirunelveli (1920), Thanjavur (1921),\nTirupur (1922), Salem (1923) and Thiruvannamalai (1924).\nWhen the same resolution was not passed in the Congress\nConference at Kancheepuram in November 1925, Periyar\nquit the Congress party. Enraged, he thundered that his only\nfuture task was to destroy the Brahmin rule by all means.\nSo, in December 1925, he organized a parallel conference\nof non-Brahmins and launched the Self Respect Movement.\nWhen he met the Congress leader M.K.Gandhi at Bangalore\nin 1927, he strongly argued that unless the poisonous castesystem called 'Varnashrama Dharma' was uprooted, the\neradication of 'Untouchability' was not possible. With\n\n106\n\n\fPeriyar's active support, the minister S.Muthaiah (Mudaliar)\nimplemented the Communal Reservation scheme of the\nJustice Party.\nOn 2 May 1925, he had started to publish a Tamil\nweekly magazine titled Kudi Arasu (Republic). In his\nsecond journalistic foray, he started the English magazine\n'Revolt' on 7 November 1928.\nIn February 1929, the first provincial conference of\nSelf-Respect Movement was organized in Chengalpattu.\nThe same year, he introduced a new rationalist marriage\nsystem called the Self-Respect Marriage where rituals and\nBrahmin priests uttering mantras where forbidden. He\nencouraged inter-caste and widow remarriages. Marriage\nwas stripped of its many rituals, it was secularized, and was\na simple declaration between the life-partners. He insisted\non a rational outlook to bring about intellectual\nemancipation. He sought to annihilate the hierarchical,\nbirth-based caste structure and establish an egalitarian social\nstructure.\nThe Self-Respect Movement also carried on a strong\npropaganda against the ridiculous superstitions practiced by\nthe people. He strove to dispel their ignorance. He was\nagainst religion and the domination of Brahmins.\nBecause of his rationalist philosophy, Periyar has often\nbeen compared with Voltaire (1694-1778). Both had\naroused their people to realize that all men are equal and it\nis the birthright of every individual to enjoy liberty, equality\nand fraternity. Both opposed religion virulently because the\nso-called men of religion invented myths and superstitions\nto keep the innocent and ignorant people in darkness and go\non exploiting them. If Periyar's opposition of religion and\nsuperstition was an attack on the Brahmins, Voltaire too had\ncondemned religious men in similar terms. In one of his\narticles, Voltaire wrote, \"They (the religious men) inspired\nyou with false beliefs and made you fanatics so that they\nmight be your masters. They made you superstitious, not\nthat you might fear god but that you might fear them.\"\nThe second provincial conference of the Self Respect\nMovement was held in Erode in May 1930. The same year\n\n107\n\n\fhe actively supported the Bill for the abolition of Devadasi\nsystem (young girls from a particular backward community\nwere dedicated as dancing girls to temples).\nHis social work was multifaceted. Not only did he fight\nfor equality and the rights of the oppressed people, but he\nalso had a program for economic equality. Along with the\nveteran communist leader M.Singaravel, he organised\nindustrial and agricultural labourers to stand against the\nexploitation of big capitalists and landlords. However, since\nthe British took steps to ban the Communist Party of India\nand similar organizations, Periyar toned down his socialist\nactivities. Because of his experience he knew that there\nwere a lot of support to carry on the freedom struggle and\norganize the labourers, but not everybody would come\nforward to criticize the tyranny of Brahmins. In 1933, the\nBritish banned his magazine Kudi Arasu. He consequently\nstarted another magazine Puratchi (Revolution). In 1934,\nJayaprakash Narayan, the reputed Socialist Leader asked\nPeriyar to join the Socialist party. The same year, Periyar\nstarted the Tamil weekly Pagutharivu (Rationalism).\nThe Tamil weekly paper Viduthalai (Liberation) of the\nJustice Party, which was founded in 1935, started to be\npublished by Periyar as a Tamil daily from 1.1.1937. When\nthe Justice Party was voted out of office in 1937,\nRajagopalachari headed the newly elected Congress\nGovernment. He announced that Hindi was going to be a\nsubject of compulsory study in schools. Periyar vehemently\nopposed this imposition of a language and organized a\ncampaign against it on a war footing. On 26 December\n1935, at a conference convened in Tiruchi, Periyar declared\nthat the only solution to defeat the dominance of Hindi over\nTamil and the Dravidian race was to have a separate state:\nTamil Nadu for the Tamils alone. More than 1200 people\nwere imprisoned in 1938, of whom two youths Thalamuthu\nand Natarasan (a Dalit) lost their lives due to the beatings in\nprison. Periyar was also incarcerated. On 13 November\n1938, while Periyar was in prison undergoing rigorous\nimprisonment, a conference of Tamil Women held in\n\n108\n\n\fChennai conferred on him the title of 'Periyar' (lit. Great\nMan).\nOn 29-12-1938, as Periyar continued to remain\nimprisoned, the Justice Party elected him its President in the\nProvincial Conference held in Chennai.\nPeriyar viewed the imposition of a language as a\ncultural subjugation. This lead to his demand for an\nindependent Dravidar Nadu, a nation for the Dravidians.\nHe believed in German scholar Max Mueller's (now\ncontroversial) Arya Invasion Theory that postulated the\nsubjugation of Dravidian races (who Periyar identified with\n'lower' castes) by an invading Aryan race (who Periyar\nidentified with Brahmins and 'upper' castes). Periyar's antiBrahmin views were based on the idea that all Brahmins are\nupper class Aryans and all non-Brahmins are lower-class\nDravidians. He accused Brahmins of subjugating the\nDravidian civilization. It must also be noted that his concept\nof Dravidians was not based on the purity of blood or on\nethnicity. It was about an Aryan caste-ridden society being\ncontrasted with an egalitarian Dravidian society based on\nthe humane traditions of the Tamils.\nThe Congress Ministry in Madras and seven other\nProvinces resigned on 29 October 1939, following the\noutbreak of the Second World War. They protested against\nthe British rulers involving India in the war without having\nconsulted the High Command of the party. Consequently,\nthe Governor and Governor General requested Periyar to\ncome and form the ministry. The offer came once in 1940\nand again in 1942. Even his friend C.Rajagopalachari\npersonally requested Periyar to accept the offer and assured\nhim of outside support. Periyar refused it on both the\noccasions. He reasoned that if he accepted power his aim of\nannihilating the caste system would receive a set back.\nOn his north-Indian tour, Periyar met Dr. B. R.\nAmbedkar in Mumbai. Both of them also met the Muslim\nLeague leader M. A. Jinnah on 8 January 1940. Periyar\nspoke of his commitment to create an independent State\nknown as Dravidar Nadu. On 21 January 1940, the Madras\nProvincial Government, under the Governor's rule\n\n109\n\n\fabolished the compulsory study of Hindi in schools.\nCongratulations poured in for Periyar's efforts, even Jinnah\nhad sent a congratulatory telegram.\nBecause of Periyar's relentless struggle, the degrading\npractice of serving food separately for the Brahmins and the\n'others' in restaurants at railway stations was abolished in\nMarch 1941.\nIn its provincial conference held in Salem on 27 August\n1944, the Justice Party was officially renamed the Dravidar\nKazhagam. Its members were required to drop the caste\nsuffixes of their names. They were also asked to give up the\nposts, positions and titles conferred on them by the British\nrulers. A resolution was also passed that members of this\nmovement should not contest elections, thereby\ntransforming a political party into a mass socio-cultural\norganization.\nThe Dravidar Kazhagam flag was adopted in 1946. It\nwas a black rectangular flag in the ratio 3:2, and there was\nred circle in the middle of the black background. Black\nrepresented the indignities to which the Dravidians were\nsubjected by the Hindu religion, and the red stood for the\nliberation of the people. On 15 August 1947, Periyar said\nthat the Tamils must observe Indian Independence Day as a\nday of mourning, because he felt that it was only a transfer\nof power from the British to the Brahmins and north-Indian\nmerchants (Baniyas). The Congress Government of Madras\nProvince banned the Black Shirt Volunteer Corps created by\nPeriyar in March 1948. However, it only made the Dravidar\nKazhagam more popular. As a result more than a lakh\npeople participated in their conference held on 8 and 9 May\n1948.\nPeriyar deeply regretted the assassination of Gandhi by\na Brahmin. In a obituary, Periyar suggested that India\nshould be named as \"Gandhi Nadu (Nation)\" in honour of\nGandhi's martyrdom.\nBecause Hindi was reintroduced in the curriculum in\nJune 1948, Periyar launched the second anti-Hindi agitation\nat Kumbakonam on 10 August 1948. Unable to bear the\npublic pressure, the Government dropped the scheme.\n\n110\n\n\fMeanwhile, power-crazy elements in the Dravidar\nKazhagam deserted it to form the Dravidar Munnetra\nKazhagam in 1948. Periyar married Maniammai in 1949.\nAfter the Indian Constitution was adopted on 26\nJanuary 1950, the Brahmins succeeded in striking down the\nCommunal Government Order (GO). They argued that the\npolicy of reservation in educational institutions for the\ndisadvantaged communities violated the fundamental right\nto non-discrimination. The Madras High Court struck down\nthe Communal GO saying that it was ultravires of the\nConstitution. The Supreme Court upheld this. Periyar toured\nall over Tamil Nadu. Rattled by his formidable opposition,\nthe Constitution was amended for the first time by the\nCentral Government. Constitution {First Amendment Act}\nwas passed in 1951 adding the Clause 4 to the Article 15:\n\"Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of Article 29 shall\nprevent the State from making any special provision for the\nadvancement of any socially and educationally backward\nclasses of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes.\"\nIn 1952, Rajagopalachari introduced the hereditary\neducation policy where children would study in schools in\nthe forenoon and practice the occupation of their parents in\nthe afternoon. Periyar was evidently against it. He viewed it\nas a perpetuation of the caste system and Brahminical\ndomination. He vehemently opposed it.\nHis vociferous campaign against it was so powerful that\nRajagopalachari had to quit the post of Chief Minister in\nMarch 1954. Consequently, Kamaraj came to power as the\nChief Minister. He ensured that the casteist educational\npolicy was withdrawn. Though Periyar had walked out of\nthe Congress, he supported Kamaraj as an individual\nbecause of his commitment to people's issues. In fact\nPeriyar labeled him the Pachai Tamizhan (Raw Tamilian).\nOn Vesak (Buddha's birthday), Periyar publicly broke\nidols of Pillaiyar in order to make people realize the idiocy\nof idol worship. He convened a Buddhist Conference at\nErode. In 1954, he left for Burma to attend the World\n\n111\n\n\fBuddhist Conference where he once again met Dr. B.R.\nAmbedkar.\nWhen the reorganization of states on linguistic basis\ntook place on 1 November 1956, Periyar welcomed it.\nHotels in run by the Brahmins were called 'Brahmin\nHotel' in the name boards, giving the impression that it was\na superior caste. Periyar wanted to put an end to this and so\nlaunched a struggle. A symbolic protest was organized in\nChennai on 5 May 1957 before one such Brahmin Hotel.\nAgitations continued daily and till 22 March 1958, 1010\nvolunteers had courted arrest. Periyar succeeded and the\nterm Brahmin Hotel disappeared from nameboards all over\nthe state.\nMore than 10,000 volunteers of the Dravidar Kazhagam\nburnt the provisions of the Constitution that helped\nsafeguard the caste-system. More than 3000 of them were\nsentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment. More than 15\npeople died in and out of jail due to incarceration. In fact, a\nspecial act was passed to convict them.\nPeriyar was sentenced on 14 December 1957 to\nundergo six months imprisonment in a false case where it\nwas alleged that he had instigated his followers to attack\nBrahmins.\nIn February 1958, he undertook a tour of North India\nand addressed meetings at Kanpur, Lucknow and New\nDelhi where he propagated his ideology. In June 1960,\nPeriyar asked people to burn the map of India to signify that\nthe Union of India under the Central Government rule was a\nBrahmin rule that safeguarded casteism. Thousands of\npeople were arrested for taking part in this demonstration.\nRiding on the success of the anti-Hindi agitation that\nclaimed hundreds of lives in the few weeks from 25 January\n1965 to 15 February 1965, the Dravidar Munnetra\nKazhagam won the state Legislative Assembly elections in\n1967. C.N.Annadurai, who became the Chief Minister, went\nto his mentor Periyar and sought his goodwill and advice,\napart from 'dedicating his ministry' to Periyar. Three of the\nachievements of his ministry where: the decision to rename\nthe Madras state as Tamil Nadu; introduction the two-\n\n112\n\n\flanguage formula of Tamil and English instead of the threelanguage formula of Tamil, English and Hindi; legalization\nof the Self-Respect marriage system.\nIn October 1967, Periyar accepted an invitation to visit\nLucknow and address a conference of SCs, BCs, and\nMinorities.\nIn 1968, the Aryan epic Ramayana was burnt all over\nTamil Nadu has a mark of protest against domination and\noppression by the Aryans.\nIn 1970, Periyar started the fortnightly magazine Unmai\n(Truth). The then party General Secretary K.Veeramani\nreleased the first issue. In 1971, Periyar launched the\nEnglish magazine Modern Rationalist.\nIn 1969, he had announced the agitation for entry into\nthe sanctum sanctorum of temples. So far, only Brahmins\nhad been priests and performed worship in Sanskrit. The\nSupreme Court Judgment on this topic was ambiguous and\ninterpreted in favour of the Brahmins. Even in the\nConference for Eradication of Social Indignity held in\nChennai on 8, 9 December 1973, he exhorted people to fight\nfor equal rights to enter sanctum sanctorum of the temples\nirrespective of their caste. On 19 December 1973, he\ndelivered his final speech at Thayagaraya Nagar in Chennai.\nIt was a clarion call, urging the people to fight for social\nequality. He took ill on the next day and breathed his last on\n24 December 1973. Millions of Tamilians mourned his loss.\nIt was the end of an epoch, a great man who was living\nhistory.\nIn his life period of 94 years, 3 months and 7 days he\nhad totally traveled 8,20,000 miles for his propaganda work.\n(This distance is 33 times the diameter of earth and 3 times\nthe distance between earth and moon). He had totally\naddressed about 10,700 meetings. The total duration of his\nlifetime speechings was 2,14,000. If it were allowed to run\non a cassette it would run continuously for 2 years, 5\nmonths and 11 days.\n\n113\n\n\f3.2 Translations of the Speeches and Writings of Periyar\nrelated to Untouchability\n\nIn this section we have provided the relevant, translated\nexcerpts from the speeches and writings of Periyar that deal\nwith untouchability.\nTemple Entry\nFew people feel uneasy with me, but I will not change my\npolicies or principles. Even among the gods, they teach us\ndifferences. For example, everybody can touch the Hindu\nGod Pillayar. Anyone can pray to him. In the Kasi temple in\nUttar Pradesh, anyone can pray even in the sanctum\nsanctorum. But the cruel rules prevailing today in the\ntemples in our place are: this man should not go inside, this\nman should not pray, only man of this community should\npray, that too in a particular language and so on and so\nforth. For these social differences and ill treatments, we\nspend a lot of money and lose our self-respect.\n[Hero of Vaikom, 1923]\nConversion\nWho are the one crore Christians of our country? Who are\nthe seven crores Muslims of our nation? Due to the\natrocities by Brahmins and our religious leaders, they have\nbeen forced to take up other religions. They are our\nbrothers. They are not from Jerusalem or Arabia.\nHow are we, the 24 crores people, respected? Muslims\ncall us 'kufr'. Christians call us 'ignorant of religion,'\nWhites call us 'coolies,' Britons call us 'uncultured' and\nBrahmins call us 'Sudra.' We do not feel disgraced by such\nthings. In the name of religion, we are denied entry into\ncertain streets even today. In the Vedas there are only four\ncastes, but now there are over 4000 castes, these castes still\nstrive to maintain their identity.\n[Hero of Vaikom, 1923]\n\n114\n\n\fUntouchability\nThings like untouchability, unseeability, not talking, not\ncoming close has not left anyone in our country. Not only is\nit customary for a person to say that one below him [in the\ncaste hierarchy] is untouchable and unseeable, and the same\nperson is untouchable and unseeable to one above him, but\nall these people taken together are untouchable and\nunseeable, and unapproachable to the Europeans, which is\nthe caste that rules us.\nIn this manner, to talk of eradicating untouchability is\nshameful. It is not only about the emancipation of the\nPanchamas, it is not only about removing their difficulties,\nbut it is about removing the disgrace and atrocities inside\neach one of us: the notion of untouchability.\nWhen this is said, they feel surprised: \"Ah! Removal of\nuntouchability! Can the Panchamas be allowed into the\nstreets? Are they to be touched? Are they to be seen?\"\n[Kudiarasu, 21-6-1925]\nUntouchability\nWhen they say that some people should not walk in the\nstreets and that some people should not be seen, we must\nthink of what these people feel in their hearts and on what\nbasis they say such things. People of other religions like\nMuslims, Christians and Parsis can walk in the streets. A\npig, dog, cat, rat can walk in the street; these can be seen\nwhile eating or at other times. The Hindu Tamil Ian who\nwas born and brought up in Tamil Nadu, and who has made\nTamil Nadu his own for thousands of years, is told by\nanother: 'You should not walk in the streets, don't come in\nfront of me.' How can a human being digest this?\nThis is the philosophy of the Vaikom Satyagraha and\nthe Gurukulam struggle. Remember that only based on this\nphilosophy, Mahatma Gandhi carried out a Satyagraha in\nSouth Africa, and the Kenyan Boycott of Imperialism Day\nwas celebrated.\n[Kudiarasu, 5-7-1925]\n\n115\n\n\fCommunal Representation\nMore than the communal representation for non-Brahmins,\nthe communal representation for Untouchables is very\nimportant-we will say this even from the gopuram of the\ntemples. They have not attained development in education,\nor employment, or in other streams of public life in\nproportion to their population in the society. As a result of\nthis, these people who are one-fifth of the nation, forget the\nwelfare of the nation; in search of the Government's grace,\nthey go and fall into another religion and sprout as our\nenemies. The selfish do not worry about this. It is not just to\nsay that it is betrayal of the nation. If the responsible public\nignores it, I will say that it is a greater sin.\nIf this society had been given communal representation\nat least some 25 years ago, will we have this kind of\ndifference of opinion, lack of unity, British tyranny and\nBrahmin cruelty in our country even today? The man who\nshould not walk in the street, the man who should not be\nseen, the man who should not know his own religion, the\nman who should not see his own god: can such categories\nexist in India? Everyone with a social outlook must think\nabout this. They need to implement this in the state\nconference and bring it into force because it is the duty of\nthe patriots.\n[Kudiarasu, 8-11-1925]\nUntouchability\nIt is the foremost duty of non-Brahmins to abolish\nuntouchability. Only the advancement of the Untouchables\nand the non-Brahmins is the advancement of the nation.\nOnly the sorrow of the Untouchables is the sorrow of the\nnon-Brahmins who form 97% of the population.\nOnly by the abolition of the untouchability, the nonBrahmins can be saved or redeemed. Only after the\nabolition of untouchability, our nation can achieve real\nSwaraj (Self-rule). So, all people who are worried about the\nabolition of untouchability and those who are called\n\n116\n\n\fUntouchables should come to Kancheepuram, conduct the\nconference and derive its advantages.\n[Kudiarasu, 15-11-1925]\nSwaraj\nThe Brahmins think that Swaraj is a means of asserting\nthemselves as superior and it is a method of exploitation by\nestablishing that the others are low. Does Swaraj mean\nusing the common, uneducated people to conduct agitations\nand thus get better government posts and better salary for\nthemselves?\nThe evidence that it is not Swaraj at present is clear\nfrom the fact that people live without self-respect, without\nequality; they keep stating that one is high and the other is\nlow; majority of the people are termed as Untouchables,\nthey are degraded worse than animals, they suffer all\ncruelties without any liberty and so on.\n[Kudiarasu, 15-11-1925]\nCommunal Representation\nEven after the British ruled for over 150 years, we have 7\ncrore people who remain Untouchables, they have not yet\nobtained or qualified for freedom. So, they are completely\ndependent on the government. The 24 crore non-Brahmin\nHindus who have lost their equality in the British rule are\ntermed as Backward Classes. They have to depend on the\n3% Brahmins and the government for their living. What is\nthe reason for all this? Is it due to the fact that they were not\nqualified to get these equalities by birth? Or, is it due to the\nfact that those in the higher positions cruelly ensured that\nthese people remain undeveloped?\nIf the non-Brahmins and the Untouchables had been\ngiven communal representation at least 50 years ago what\nwould be their position now? The posts held by B.N\nSharma, and C.P.Ramasamy Iyer would have been held by\n[the Depressed Class leaders] M.C. Rajah and R. Veeraiyan.\nIf R.Veeraiyan had been in the place of C.P.Ramasamy\nIyer, will they impose Section 144 [curfew/ embargo] in the\n\n117\n\n\fstreets of Palakkad? Would they [Untouchables] be\npunished for visiting temples? What is the reason for their\nnot getting such posts? Is it due to lack of qualification? Is it\nnot due to the absence of communal representation?\nHow did Mohammed Habibullah Sahib and Dr.\nMohammed Usman get reputed positions with salaries of\nRs.5,000 to Rs.6,000? How did they become qualified to get\nthese posts? Is it not because of communal representation?\nLet the public think about it! Depressed Classes and\nBackward Classes cannot get equality unless they have\ncommunal representation.\nBefore the British came, were the Backward Classes,\nBackward Classes? The only reason that can be attributed is\nthat the Brahmins pleased the British to such an extent that\nthe Brahmins became forward class and obtained all the\nrights and comforts. However, the non-Brahmins who were\nnot like them became Backward Classes. How can the\nBackward\nClasses\nimprove\nwithout\ncommunal\nrepresentation? Don't they have intelligence, strength, and\neducation? Why have they not got their rights?\nIndians are of several castes. They are divided into eight\ncategories. If the government stops paying fat salaries it\nwould not be difficult to give communal representation.\n[Kudiarasu, 22-11-1925]\nPress\nThe policy of the newspapers should be primarily for\nequality and improvement of the non-Brahmins and\nUntouchables. The direct administration of the newspapers\nshould be in the hands of a few reliable persons who work\nonly for the press and are not a part of any other public\nwork or trade or government. The board that carries out this\nwork should be renewed once in every five years.\n[Kudiarasu, 22-11-1925]\nCommunal representation\nFor the sake of development and unity of the nation, it is\nresolved in this conference that in all the political posts, the\n\n118\n\n\fGovernment must take into account the population of each\nof the three categories: the Brahmins, non-Brahmins and the\nDepressed classes and should follow communal\nrepresentation in all posts. This conference will take\nattempts to pressurize the government to follow this.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-12-1925]\nCommunal Representation\nHow do we maintain the Untouchables? Even after 200\nyears of British rule, can an untouchable stand in an election\nagainst a caste-Hindu and win? Does any Indian think of\nmaking the Depressed Classes, who are one-third of the\npopulation, stand in an election, support and elect them?\nHave anyone of the leaders shown this way? So, the only\nstate of mind in which everyone lives is, \"I will not give my\nsupport for your equality and if you wish to attain equality,\nwe will destroy it.\" Is this human?\nIndia will never get complete freedom until there are\nequal rights for every sect of people. If everyone has to get\nequal rights, the only medicine is communal representation.\nTrying to overrule and evade without providing communal\nrepresentation is just like thinking that closing it without\napplying any medicine can cure a sore in the human body.\nThe people cannot realize true equality and freedom\nunless communal representation is given. In these days if\nanyone talks about the emancipation of his caste or about\nthe development of the Depressed Classes he is termed a\ntraitor. This situation not only shows the degraded state of\nthe Backward Classes and the Depressed Classes, but also\nthe supremacy of the high castes.\n[Kudiarasu, 13-12-1925]\nReligious conversion\nWe see that the government officials who were on the side\nof the Brahmins at the beginning of the Satyagraha are now\nagainst the Brahmins by holding the hands of the so-called\nUntouchables.\n\n119\n\n\fAt that time, even we felt surprised about the power of\nthe Satyagraha. We observe this kind of power because we\npatiently experienced the difficulties arising out of\nSatyagraha. If we had plunged into it with force, or in anger,\nor in malice, we could not have seen such powers at any\npoint of time.\nThe objective of Satyagraha is not that we should walk\nin the streets in which the disgraceful dogs and pigs walk. It\nis just that in public life, there ought to be no difference\nbetween man and man. That philosophy does not end with\nwalking on this street. So, it is the duty of humans to prove\nthe rights in the street, in the temples also.\nWhen Mahatma Gandhi and the Travancore Maharani\nmet, she asked the Mahatma, \"If we throw open the road\nnow, you will immediately take efforts to enter the temple.\"\nMahatma Gandhi said, \"Yes. That is my aim. But till I\nlearn that the people who demand the rights to enter the\ntemple have enough patience and forbearance and are\nprepared to make the necessary sacrifice, I shall not enter\ninto that effort. Till then, I shall keep doing the work\nnecessary for that. The government [officials] proved that it\nwas only the Brahmins, and not they who were opposed to\nthe Vaikom Satyagraha.\nTo go to another religion in order to attain human rights\nis a very disgraceful thing. If there is such a necessity, one\ncan go to Christianity or Islam; I do not have any liking in\ngoing to the Arya Samaj.\nBecause by going to the Arya Samaj, not only should\nthe meaningless sacred thread be donned, but the\nmeaningless ritual, sandhya vandanam (an evening ritual\nperformed by the Brahmins) must also be performed. Those\nwho had donned the sacred thread and performed the\nsandhya vandanam at one point of time are today, the\nenemies of our freedom and reformation. If you think that\nyou should also not come to that state, surely do not join\nthat group.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-12-1925]\n\n120\n\n\fHindu Mahasabha\nThere are several branches of the Hindu Mahasabha. In all\nthese sabhas and its branches, the Brahmins say that they\nare superior by birth and that the notion of untouchability\nthat is mentioned in the Sastras should be maintained\nbecause they cannot disrespect the Vedas. T.R.\nRamachandra Iyer, Chairman of the Chennai branch of\nHindu Mahasabha is a monument who practices the\nconcepts that Brahmins are of high caste, untouchability is\nordained in the Sastras, and Untouchables should not walk\nin the streets and are not to be seen. The Kumbakonam chief\nis not any less since he has passed a resolution in his branch\nof the Hindu Mahasabha that untouchability should not be\nabolished because it is related with the Sastras.\nEven Madan Mohan Malaviya who spoke about\nUntouchables with tears in his eyes has never accepted the\nfact that there is no difference between him and an\nuntouchable. This is because he strongly believes in the\nVarnashrama dharma.\n[Kudiarasu, 13-12-1925]\nSacred Thread Identity\nLike how a new born child of the lower caste, is sparkling\nclean at birth, and as it grows, because of not bathing\nregularly, because of wearing dirty clothes, it is also called\nas a member of the untouchable caste, like that even though\na Brahmin child is also born like ordinary children, after\nsome time, when it dons a sacred thread it attains the status\nof being called upper caste.\nBut, if such a child is born in the homes of those who\nare not lower castes, even if it is not bathed properly and it\nwears dirty clothes, it does not attain the state of a low\ncaste. We see that even today. Just like an unclean man who\nsubconsciously feels that he is a little unclean, a man who\nwears the sacred thread feels that he is an upper caste. Not\nonly that, but he also feels that others are lower caste.\nHow will the low status of a man improve because of\nwearing this sacred thread? Do all the non-Brahmins who\n\n121\n\n\fwear the sacred thread, have parity with the Brahmins?\nNow, in our country the Singurao, Chettiar, Asariyar,\nKuyavar, Vanniyar, Sowrashtrar, Thevangar, Komuti, Raju,\nVaaniyar Pandaram, some sections of the Naickers, and the\nValluvars (who are still called Panchamas): all these nonBrahmin brothers wear the sacred thread. Have they been\naccorded status like Brahmins?\nToday, don't we see many cheats, prostitutes, lepers\nwho are evidently Brahmins? What is the belief that this\n[sacred thread identity] will not become like that? In our\ncountry, even before this, in order to create equality, several\ngreat people like Sri Ramanujacharya put sacred threads to\nseveral Depressed Classes and through rituals, made them\nhigher. Those who were strong in cunning and slyness,\nbecame Brahmins and are worse than the Brahmins before\nthem; they have become the god of death for our society\nand our nation. Though they donned the sacred thread, those\nwho were powerless remain as they were.\nIt is our opinion that there is no other work that could\ncreate greater blemish for our nation. What we understand is\nthat for India's development, as important as it is for\nuntouchability to be eradicated, it is more important for the\nsacred thread to be eradicated. In a sack of rice, if there is a\nmeasure of one padi (1/80 of a sack of rice) of stones; after\nspreading it on the floor, is it easy to pick out that one padi\nof stones, or is it easy to leave the stones and keep picking\nup rice?\n[Kudiarasu, 27-12-1925]\nSelf-Respect\nIf we keep on one side of the balance (a measuring scale),\nthe atrocities done to us by the government and on the other\nside the atrocities done to us by others [Brahmins], only the\natrocities done to us by others would weigh more.\nIf a person with human form has no right to see (his)\ngod and worship it, then how can he have any self-respect?\nWhat is the use of Swaraj in this social setup? What is the\nmatter whatever the rule? The social setup has made a set of\n\n122\n\n\fpeople remain without any self-respect. If these demons of\nsociety get Swaraj will it do any good to people leading a\nlife without any self-respect? Seeking for, or attaining\nSwaraj is of no use when people like us do not have even\nthe right to worship, see the god we believe in and walk in\nthe streets; worse, we should not even be seen by them!\nThe foreigners (British) who ruled us did not ill-treat us\nlike this; without their rule we would have continued to live\nin cruelty without even realizing the social injustice faced\nby us. We would not have had the Self Respect Movement.\nThe enemies of our Self Respect Movement are not the\nBritish, but only the Brahmins who are outsiders and are\nruling us. Since the Brahmins are in favour of the\ngovernment, the British are not bothered about the cruelties\nthat the Brahmins subject us to. It is important for people to\nsay that untouchability should be abolished, and that\neverybody should wear the kadhar (handspun cotton) dress\nfor Self Respect. But the chief of the Self Respecter's duties\nis to fight against men who don't allow other men to walk\nin the same street, come near them, be seen by them, see\ngod or worship him. What is the use of independence for\nthese people?\nFurther, they cannot earn more because they simply\nlabour for other people without any benefit. They cannot\neven lead a life of self-respect. A set of people is trying to\nuse its cunning to exploit these people and continues to\npractice cruelties on them. In such conditions, the words\n'Independence', 'Swaraj', 'rights' are words that will only\ngive us disgrace and cruelties, so they are baseless. If\nanyone really wants to toil for the welfare of the nation,\nthen, let him first work towards making every individual\nlead a life of self-respect.\n[Kudiarasu, 24-1-1926].\nCaste atrocities\nIt is of primary importance that the cruelties based on caste\nand the arrogance of high caste is abolished at first. Keeping\nall these faults intact, and yet voicing support for the rights\n\n123\n\n\fof the South Africans and writing as if one has all concern\nfor the Untouchables and shedding crocodile tears is only an\natrocious act. It is not an act with any conscience. In these\ncircumstances, do we need Swaraj or independence? Or, do\nwe really need only advancement without self-respect? The\ncommon man should reflect upon it!\n[Kudiarasu, 31-1-1926]\nCommunal Representation\nThose who really want the nation to attain development will\ncertainly think that it lies in the betterment of Depressed and\nBackward Classes. Nation here connotes every caste and\ncommunity, not a particular powerful community. There are\nonly 3 castes: Brahmins, Non-Brahmins and the Depressed\nClasses. They live with faithlessness and are unhappy\namong themselves. The Government need not talk about\nAndhras, Tamils or Kannadigas because everything falls\nwithin these 3 categories. Also problems would be settled if\nthese three divisions are given communal representation.\nThe Government need not feel that this will give raise to\nseveral subcastes.\nEven among such subcastes, communal representation\ncan be given to the subcastes. In Britain, there are only 31\u20444\ncrore people but they are governed by 700 members. No,\nthe inclusion of all sections of people into power and\npolitics is not difficult. In fact, only that can give the nation\nequality and real freedom.\n[Kudiarasu, 14-2-1926]\nCommunal Representation\nAt present, Swaraj means only the rule of Brahmins. Even\nin the British rule, we see that people of specific castes\ncannot walk in certain streets, they should not use ponds for\nwater and several other types of atrocities are practiced on\nthem. If Swaraj, which is Brahmin Raj, is in force, they will\nnot be afraid to torture these people. How to trust them?\nOver seven crore people who are very calm are treated\nworse than animals by the Brahmins. Why should they stay\n\n124\n\n\flike this? Can we change the calm people into animals and\nthe dishonest cheats into gods by not giving communal\nrepresentation in politics and employment? Through power\nand money, the cheats always use cunning means to pull\ndown others and come up. Hence there is always a perennial\nproblem of difference and discrimination at its height.\nWith the single fear that communal representation could\ncome to practice, the Brahmins always tolerated and\nendured the government. If the government was not amiable\nto them, they tried to replace it. So, the government also\nfeared the Brahmins and adjusted with them. If we rule our\nnation at any point of time it can be only through communal\nrepresentation. This should be encrusted in diamonds.\n[Kudiarasu, 18-4-1926]\nHinduism and Caste\nHinduism means keeping the signs of holy ash, or sandal\netc., on the forehead and calling each caste as high or low.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-5-1926]\nOrigin of Caste\nPresently, Brahmins in this country, under the garb of\npatriotism have been preaching through their speeches,\nwritings and through others that I am a sectarian and that I\ninstigate sectarian clashes. You should think a little whether\nsectarian differences and enmity was created because of me\nor because of the Brahmins of our country!\nIf you will please get up and come with me-if we go\naround this village several boards which say, 'This is for\nBrahmins'; 'This is for Sudras'; 'Panchamas, Muslims and\nChristians will not be given food, snacks or water here';\n'Sudras should not draw water from here'; 'Sudras should\nnot bathe here'; 'Sudras will not be admitted into this\nschool'; 'Sudras should not read these topics'; 'Only\nBrahmins can go so far-Sudras should not go beyond this\npoint'; 'Sudras should not reside in this street'; 'Panchamas\nshould not walk in this street' are placed in every coffee\nshop that the Brahmins own, in every hall, in every tank and\n\n125\n\n\ftemple, rules are created, and people are divided; aversion\nand dislike are created; disgrace is created: Am I the one\ndoing all this? Or, is it the Brahmins? Observe this.\nThe Buddhists and Jains eradicated the cruelty of\nBrahmins and said people are equal; love and brotherhood\nalone was God. The Brahmins could not accept it so they\ndestroyed all these efforts.\nAt the time when the Brahmins said that they were\nupper-caste, those who were powerful refused to accept it\nand were about to use force, so the Brahmins cunningly\nsaid, \"You shall be the Kshatriyas and rule, we will be your\nministers and give you advice,\" and thus they cheated them\nand brought them within their influence.\nWhen the wealthy and the influential asked, \"How can\nyou become a higher caste?\" The Brahmins told them, \"You\nshall be the Vaishyas, we also place the sacred thread on\nyou, just like ourselves\" and cheated them too. Later, the\nmajority who were farmers and artisans were made to work\nfor the three sections above them, including the Brahmins.\nWhen several among them did not accept this, the Brahmins\nsaid, \"We have kept a section lower to you, you are their\nmasters. You can treat them as you like.\" Thus they made\nthe peaceful, guileless, non-aggressive people, to be called\nthe Panchamas and exposed them to the Sudras, and thus\ncheated them. Finally, a voiceless section is suffering as\nUntouchables.\nToday, you are considering only these people-who did\nsuch cruelty-as the head of your religion. If such cruelty\nhas to be removed from us, we must gain dominance in\nreligious and political matters. After gaining power, we\nmust try to attain our self-respect. It is my humble and\ndecisive opinion that whether it is for a society or for a\nnation, self-respect is more important than Swaraj.\n[Kudiarasu, 15-8-1926]\nBiographical\nFrom the time I was seven years old, I knew about caste\ndifferences and untouchability. Though I was born in a very\n\n126\n\n\forthodox family, I criticized everyone and mingled with\neveryone without any distinction, so I was not allowed to\nget into the kitchen of my home. Except my father, all the\nfamily members used to wash the tumblers that I used. The\npersons who used to be jealous of my family's orthodoxy\nbecame peaceful or happy on seeing me.\n[Kudiarasu, 22-8-1926]\nSelf-Respect\nTo fight against untouchability, one should have strength of\nmind, tolerance, and fearlessness since the majority of\nenemies of the self-respect movement are Brahmins of our\nown country and it is not an easy task to win over them. For\nthis, we need unity and sacrifice. I can expect all these from\nyou. But what more you need is self-confidence. Above all,\nthe blind beliefs ingrained in you must be lost.\nThe first reason is your feeling that the Brahmins are\nsuperior by birth and your belief that there is someone\ninferior to you. This concept should first get out of your\nmind. In all your family rituals, the thought that the\nBrahmins are higher than you should be wiped away from\nyour mind.\nPlease campaign against these. All thee people who\nbelieve that some others are lower than them will not come\nto help you. You need proper self-control. In every village\nform youth associations in which Brahmins are not allowed\nmembership. So, do this. We need money for all this,\nbecause nothing can be done without money.\nSince money or material is very important, you should\neven be prepared to beg to get it, but you should maintain\nthe accounts properly. Enemies will try to falsely blame\nanybody who works powerfully, fearing them would not be\nof any use. We should bear all difficulties and loss. We\nshould work hard and sacrifice anything and not mind the\naspersions cast on us by our enemies or mind our names\ngetting spoilt or defamed by our enemies but work without\nfear. This is the biggest form of sacrifice one can do.\n\n127\n\n\fBefore getting from up the bed, everyone should think,\n\"What should I do for self-respect?\" If you have not done\nanything for self-respect consider that day to be wasted.\nThis is the responsibility of youth. You should consider it a\npenance to give your life for self-respect.\n[Kudiarasu, 12-9-1926]\nCongress and Untouchability\nWhat is the poison of untouchability in the Congress?\nBrahmins refuse to look at us and the Untouchables. You\nwould have seen this in the context of the Gurukulam\nproblem. When the Congress made a resolution that there is\nno difference about high/low in birth, Rajagopalachari,\nRajendra Prasad and Sastri resigned from the party. What\ncan one think of the Brahmins? Often, Srinivasa Iyengar\nsaid, \"Don't mix up \"politics\" and \"untouchability\".\nAcharya said, \"If a non-Brahmin child sees a Brahmin child\neating, I would starve for a month\" and ran away from the\nCongress Committee. From this, one can understand the\nuntouchability prevailing in the Congress.\n[Kudiarasu, 26-9-1926]\nVarnashrama Dharma\nMore than 22 crores of our people have become Sudras and\nUntouchables by birth because of Varnashrama dharma and\nare treated worse than animals, insects, and worms. Our\nancestors for over many thousands of years have fought\nagainst this untouchability and degraded status. To protect\nthe Arya dharma, the Aryans, who are Brahmins, use their\nsabhas like Varnashrama dharma Paripalana Sabha and\nArya Dharma Paripalana Sabha to maintain and establish\nthat according to Varnashrama dharma they are higher\ncastes and that Sudras are born to prostitutes, and\nPanchamas (Chandalas) should remain so (as\nUntouchables), and serve them without any reservations.\nBrahmins are afraid that Sudras and Panchamas may\nachieve independence and equality through the Self Respect\nMovement which is against Varnashrama dharma. They\n\n128\n\n\fwant the Arya dharma to be protected and at the same time\nthey do not want the Sudras and Panchamas to be wiped\naway. By their cunning and wickedness Brahmins create a\nlot of hostility and try to destroy all those movements,\nwhich work for abolition of Sudrahood and untouchability.\nThey pass resolutions that they would never accept the\nabolition of Varnashrama dharma. All movements or sabhas\nof the Aryans are only to support and establish the concept\nof untouchability and Sudrahood. For them it is a sin to talk\nwith us, see us or touch us.\nThey call our Self Respect Movement or any movement\nthat tries to wipe away Sudrahood and untouchability as\nblemished movements. They say that it is heaven if a Sudra\ndrinks the water in which a Brahmin has washed his feet.\nBut, the Brahmins wrap their sacred thread around their ear\nwhen they talk with us or when they attend nature's call.\n[Kudiarasu, 19-12-1926]\nSelf-Respect Movement\nIf true cadres, firm in ideology, campaign with integrity\nalongside honest leaders, certainly we would become\nindependent in a year. For this, firstly no one should accept\nkadhar; secondly we should not accept highness or lowness\nattributed by birth. Anyone who has difference of opinion\nover these two ideologies is an enemy of the Self Respect\nMovement. These should be mentioned as a solemn pledge\nin everyone's membership form.\n[Kudiarasu, 26-12-1926]\nTemple entry\nWhy does the power of god run away when some people\nsee god? Why do the temple and the god get polluted when\nsome people visit the temple? Why does god die when few\npeople touch him? Why do the gods, who have the same\nname and form, have different powers in different villages?\nThe gods in the cities of Kasi, Jagannath and Pandaripur do\nnot die if anyone touches them. People who go to these\ntemples worship by themselves: they touch god directly,\n\n129\n\n\fthey sprinkle water on their heads, they shower flowers and\nthey pray. But in our country, the same god with the same\nname dies when we touch it. The gods in the temples of\nSrirangam, Chidambaram, Perur, Bhavani, Kodumudi,\nTiruchengode, Karur and such holy places do not die if the\nNadars visit the temple and worship them. But the gods in\nthe districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli, and Ramanathapuram\nalone die if the Nadars worship them. Why does the power\nand life of the gods and the power of the temples differ from\nvillage to village? And why does the Brahmin alone have\nthe power to give a fresh lease of life to that god?\n[Kudiarasu, 9-1-1927]\nEquality\nFor equality, liberty and brotherhood to grow in the minds\nof people, feelings of birth-based difference must end.\nCommunal clashes add fuel to the fire. This sort of ideas\nshould develop among intelligent people.\n[Kudiarasu, 1-5-1927]\nCongress and Untouchability\nThe Congress, which should be open to all castes, is trapped\nin the hands of one or two Brahmins and has become a\nBrahmin Congress as reported by the magazine 'Tamil\nNadu.' When will it become common to all the castes? How\nmany Christians are there in the Congress? How many\nMuslims are there in the Congress? How many Panchamas\nare there in the Congress? How many Hindus are there in\nthe Congress? In such meetings are the majority from the\nCongress? Have they come away from the Congress? At\nany time, was the Congress in the hands of the nonBrahmins? At any time was it a non-Brahmin Congress?\n[Kudiarasu, 5-6-1927]\nHindu Mahasabha and other Hindu organizations\nWill the Varnasharma dharma Paripalana Sabha that is\nsaid to be common for all Hindus make Varadharajan,\n\n130\n\n\fKalyanasundara Mudaliar, or me as its members? The few\nwho run the institution say that it is the representation of the\n24 crore Hindus of India and they teach Vedas, Sastras and\nthe ceremonial recitation of the sacred texts.\nTradition and law also accept it. Great men like\nJayavelu, Muthuranga Mudaliar, Adhi Narayana Chettiar,\nand O. Kandasamy Chettiar accept it as the representative,\nbut does it mean great men like Varadarajulu, Veeraiyan,\nand M.C. Rajah accept it?\n[Kudiarasu, 12-6-1927]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nWe need not meet the Mahatma [Gandhi] again and ask his\nopinion on this; we also state that we do not have even a\nlittle doubt about our opinion. Without keeping the dialogue\nwith the Mahatma as a basis, that rebuttal was written\nkeeping in mind the speech of the Mahatma in Mysore and\nwhat he wrote. But for the Mahatma, the Varnashrama\ndharma and caste differences are birth-based. We know this\nbecause of the Mahatma's speech and his writings.\nThe Mahatma calls the Aryan religion, which is the\nreligion of the Brahmins, as the Hindu religion, and he calls\nhimself a Hindu. For his propaganda, he often shows the\nAryan myths-the puranas that is Ramayana, Bharatam,\nBhagavata, etc.- as his texts and quotes from these. We\ndare to think that these slippery puranas will somehow push\nthe Mahatma into swamp.\nThere is no chance for the Mahatma to know about the\ncivilization of Tamil Nadu, and the ancient customs of\nTamil Nadu. During the time he was in South Africa,\nthrough a few Tamilians such as Valliammai and Nagappan,\nhe might have known about the bravery of the Tamilians.\nWe can tell firmly that he would not have known of Tamil\nNadu and the Tamil people anything else except through the\nBrahmins.\nWho is there in the Mahatma's mutt to tell him of the\nnearly 2000-3000-year battle between Brahmin religion,\nwhich is the Aryan doctrine and the Tamil civilizations and\n\n131\n\n\fcustoms? So, when we preach that Tamil Nadu does not\nrequire the Aryan doctrines as far as it is concerned we need\nto say that it does not require the Mahatma's doctrines.\nWe, who argue that the people should not be divided\ndue to their profession, they cannot be divided because it is\nnot right in the nature of the world and humanity, how can\nwe accept it if it is said that 'caste exists in birth, occupation\nexists in birth, this was created by great men, it was created\nby God, it was created by sages?'\nThis is not the age of sages and Krishna etc. and that we\nare not in that age, and they are not here in this age-\nwhether it is right or wrong or true or false, there is no\nproper evidence or need or possibility and if each and every\nrationalist human understands it by him/herself, how will\nsuch grandma tales have respect?\nThe essay 'The Mahatma and Varnashrama' was sent to\nthe Mahatma also. We sent copies to his intimate followers\nand asked them to inform the Mahatma of the same, we\nhave not done anything without the knowledge of the\nMahatma. But his faithful followers teach him, \"Do not\nbother about such issues, if you give it importance, it will\ngive credential to their dissent; it will increase the integrity\nof the man who is dissenting and his magazine. So, throw it\nin the trash.\"\nIt is our opinion that the Mahatma does not have the\ntime or power to transgress it. This issue is important for the\nfreedom of our country and our self-respect. The philosophy\nof Varnashrama-that too the philosophy that Varna and\ncaste are birth-based-is the 'Yama' (lord of death).\nBecause we have come to this firm decision, we struggle to\neradicate it. We write only with the sadness that for the\nnation's liberation and self-respect, it is the duty of the man\nto realize this and we need to condemn it.\n[Kudiarasu, 28-8-1927]\nReligion\nI am not an agent for anybody or a slave to any religion; but\nI am subject to two philosophies: kindness and intellect. I\n\n132\n\n\ffeel that it is my duty, concern and wish to talk about these.\nBut I leave these duties to the reasoning of one and all.\nThey spend several lakhs of rupees to build temples, which\nare hundreds of years old. What do we get out of these?\nThink of it!\nYou are a low caste who cannot offer prayers to these\ngods. By these temples it is established that we are lower\ncastes than these Brahmins. Till the stones of the temple, the\ntemple and its gods exist, our lowness and degradation will\nbe permanent. It will continue for generations after me. We\nbuilt temples; we perform Kumbhabishekams to establish\nourselves as the low caste and the Brahmins as the high\ncaste. We give lakhs of rupees for these temples in order for\nthe Brahmins to use it. They continue to enjoy this money\nfor many generations; as long as there are stones and grass\nin the Cauvery River!\n[Kudiarasu, 11-9-1927]\nCaste Identity\nThe question is whether community [caste] conferences\ntaking place in our country are suitable for the nation's\nprogress. Several people say that this is harmful. But, it is\nmy opinion that there is no conference that is not a\ncommunity conference (that is, conference without\ncommunalism).\nEvery community holds conferences to demand its\nrights. To browbeat another community from rising up, and\nto see that another community does not get its rights,\nseveral people hold many conferences.\nBut our Nadar Conference is not like that. Without\nharming others, this conference is taking place to secure the\nNadar people's rights and welfare. Community conferences\nand communalism were created only because of the\nharassment by the upper castes. We don't organize\nconferences to create dislike. We organize this conference\njust to say, \"No need of hate; instead say all are equal.\" The\nword 'unity' that is often repeated in our country, and the\nproblems are merely outward garbs. True unity will be\n\n133\n\n\fcreated only when people can help themselves. It is\nnecessary to foster the feeling of unity among one another.\nTo work towards that, every society should have the\nfreedom. Every community must develop self-respect,\nequality and self-esteem. The nation shall attain progress\nonly through that. Self-respect alone is the real nationalism.\nSwaraj depends only on self-respect. All are equal; there\nshould be no feeling of upper or lower.\n[Kudiarasu, 9-10-1927]\nHindu Religion\nThis religion which professes that everybody should not get\neducated; if the low castes get educated in spite of the\nreligious codes their tongue should be cut off; if they hear\nslokas, molten lead should be poured into their ear; if they\nstill get educated, their throat should be cut off and several\nother types of punishments are given to them. (These\npunishments are also described in the Laws of Manu).\nExcept for the British who had come to our nation, we\ncannot imagine any form of education. Even one person out\nof thousand will not be educated due to our religion. So the\nsuffering and disgrace we undergo in the name of religion is\ninexpressible.\n[Kudiarasu, 23-10-1927]\nHindu Religion\nFurther, the idea that Brahmins are upper caste and others\nare of lower caste is being pumped into our bloodstream.\nBecause of this, a small sect of people have tortured the\nmajority of our people and made them lose their self-respect\nand live a life of poverty and difficulties. So some of them\nask us to forget the differences with Brahmins, they ask the\nBrahmins and non-Brahmins to join together to find a\nremedy for such cruelties.\nWhen we do not have the right to touch them, eat with\nthem, pray with them and even walk in the streets in which\n\n134\n\n\fthey live5 and enter the temples that are built for them. How\ncan they beg us to forget the differences; you think about\nthese! According to research, at one point of time or\nanother, each and every caste were rulers. So, the Laws of\nManu, which calls the rulers of this nation as Kshatriyas, is\nwrong. Likewise trade was in the hand of each and every\ncaste, so saying that the Vaishyas were the people who\nlooked after business is wrong!\nFurther, as of today if the Brahmin accepts all the\ndivisions, he would not have the sole authority over\neverything; so now the Brahmins say that in the Kaliyuga\nthere are only two divisions: Brahmins and Sudras. If we\nsee who is a Sudra, we see that a Sudra is the son born to a\nBrahmin and his concubine, and his only duty is to serve the\nBrahmin. How can one's mind accept this? Further, he calls\nanother group of people as Untouchables/ Chandalas and\nthey call the Christians and Muslims as Mlechas.\nI have no other option except to call people of all castes\nother than Brahmins as non-Brahmins. This problem of\ncruelty to one caste of people by another has existed for the\npast 5000 to 6000 years. This difference is against nature; it\nis non-existent in any other nation. Above all, it is against\nhumanity. They have fought for unity and love among\npeople. Let the Brahmins live with us; they had after all\ncome to India begging. But what do they do, they talk of\ndharma and sastra and put an end to all our movements. We\nhave not written in our places, 'this is for Brahmins' and\n'that place is for Sudras' but they have written so even in\nthe hotels, ponds and wells constructed by us. The\nBrahmins say, 'this is for Brahmins' and 'not for Sudras'\nand so on. The Sudras are treated worst than insects, dogs\nand pigs!\nWe are treated worse than these! Do we treat them\nbadly? What have they done except talking philosophy?\nThose who lack self-respect will not know these difficulties.\nWho will understand the sorrow we undergo every day?\nThe Kudiarasu issue dated 24.4.1926 tells the story of a boy of the\ndepressed classes who entered the Brahmin street and was beaten with a\nslipper by a Brahmin who felt that the street got polluted.\n\n5\n\n135\n\n\fSome tell us that if we abolish the differences among the\nlower castes then this will also go, but the differences\namong the lower castes are only imitation of the Brahmins\nand not done with any motivation, but only due to\nignorance.\nI am not a researcher. But the very term Jati (caste) is\nnot a Tamil word. All Vedas and the Manu Dharma, which\nare the basis of Jati, are not in any way related to our\nculture. They do not even exist in our language. Our people\nhave not written them. Somehow they have come on to our\nminds as a problem. The word 'Hindu' or 'Indu' is not there\nin any of our languages. Researchers say that it is the name\nof a river. In some places, they say that it means 'thief.'\nTo spoil our movements, our enemies have made some\npoisonous and silly comments.\nNot even a single line about Hindu religion is given in\nany purana or history. Only during the British rule, the term/\nname Hindu came into being! It is found in railway\nplatforms and hotels. The words, 'Hindu Women' and\n'Hindu Men' are found on lavatories. I will suggest what\nyou should do. We should uproot all the problems that are\ngiven to us in the name of Hindu Dharma. Never allow\nBrahmin youth to interfere in politics. Even in the rule of\nthe British you torture us; when they go away, what will be\nthe problems you will be giving to us?\n[Kudiarasu, 30-10-1927]\nNadar representation\nBecause of Ramanathapuram King's death, the Presidency\nof the Ramathapuram District Board has fallen vacant\ntoday. We suggest to the Government that in the present\ncircumstance, that too as far as Ramanathapuram District is\nconcerned, than leaving that position for open election, it\nwill be a more intelligent thing to nominate a suitable\nperson.\nEverybody knows that in some parts of Madurai, and in\nthe Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram districts, caste\narrogance and caste atrocities are rampant. For instance, the\n\n136\n\n\fcruelty of the Brahmins need not be described in order for a\nperson to know about it. The cruelties committed by the\nSaiva Vellalas of the south who come in the next rung,\nmake the whole non-Brahmin society ashamed. Caught\nbetween these two communities [Brahmins and Saiva\nVellalas], the difficulties faced by the people of other\ncommunities are unthinkable.\nSeveral cruelties that never take place anywhere in the\nChennai Presidency is rampant in the above districts. Our\nVaniya Chettiar brothers, who are Vaishyas, do not have the\nright to enter a Saiva temple in Tirchendur. Likewise, in\nseveral temples in Madurai and Rameshwaram, our Nadar\nbrothers who are called Kshatriyas do not have the right of\nentry. But, they have the right to enter temples in places like\nPalani etc.\nPeople are denied even the right to enter several streets\nin these two districts. Just because one or two Brahmins or\nSaiva Vellalas eat/drink with a few Nadar brothers, we\ncannot say that such problems have disappeared.\nStill, these cruelties committed in the name of God, in\nthe name of religion, in the name of Dharma Sastras, are\ngoing to be established in the name of Government's rule,\nin the name of laws and in the name of court judgments,\nhow can we escape from this? This is our question.\nIf someone says that concern is absent among people of\nthe community that has been subjected to cruelties, rather\nthan using it as an excuse, in the name of common good,\nthose concerned with the self-respect of the country must\nmake it their first duty to do the needful for the country's\nwelfare and the birth-rights of human society. Only with\nthis intention, we implore that the post of President of the\nRamanthapuram Zilla (District) Board must not be elected\nto; instead, it must be filled through nomination. If the\nvacancy is going to be filled through election, those who\nhave the mindset and opportunity to eradicate these cruelties\nwill not get that position. Only if the government is going to\nnominate, it can search and find a suitable person for the\nsaid post.\n\n137\n\n\fIf the people who have been through tremendous\nsuffering and the Depressed Classes have to attain equality,\nthey have to be given power and position; else, it is not an\neasy task for reformation to take place through other means.\nIt is our opinion that the communities, which we consider as\nbeing harassed by others, are generously given power,\nposition and employment; automatically they will attain\nliberation and equality.\nSo, the Government must pay attention to these ideas,\nand bravely come forward to annihilate caste atrocities and\ncaste arrogance and give necessary power, position,\nemployment and support to communities that have been\nvictimized for a long time, create a just influence and\nsalvage them from being oppressed.\nWe also warn the government not to tell the excuse that\nthey did not get a suitable candidate. Because when there\nare suitable persons in that community for the posts of\nMember of Legislative Assembly, Member of the District\nBoard, Chairman of the District Board, and for other\npositions; and when there are people who by themselves\nmanage large estates and businesses that have an annual\nincome of Rs.50,000 and Rs.1,00,000, if the Government\nsays that there is no one for this post alone, no one will\nbelieve the Government's integrity. So we believe that the\nLord Governor and Minister of Local Governance will not\nlose this opportunity to prove their integrity.\n[Kudiarasu, 16-9-1928]\nTemple Entry\nOne of the biggest holy shrines in Orissa is the Jagannath\ntemple. It attracts thousands of devotees every year. Here,\nthe priests are only from the barber community. They offer\nfood in heaps to god. That food is sold outside the temple as\nprasad and devotees buy and eat it. In this temple there is\nno uncleanliness; the barbers who act as priests, do the job\nof hair-cutting in their off-time. There is no caste difference\nhere. In this temple, after one eats if there is leftover rice, it\nis put back into the same container or it is served to another.\n\n138\n\n\fAnyone can use his hand to take food from the vessel and\neat it. Anyone can go to the temple to touch the statue of\ngod and pray.\nIn this temple no one can perform the vratha (fast) or\ntarpana or thithi (observance of anniversary for dead\nancestors). Unlike other temples, here we find the statues of\nBalarama, Krishna and Subadra. They are brothers and\nsister; Subadra, the sister of Balarama and Krishna stands in\nthe middle and the statues are made of wood. Usually the\nstatues in other temples are with their spouses. They say\n\"sarvam jaganathan\" when they enter the outskirts of the\ncity, which means \"all are equal and there is no difference\nbetween anyone.\"\n[Kudiarasu, 30-9-1928]\nIndigenous gods\nIn South India, 90% of the people do not know about\nSavagism or Vaishnavism. They only know about gods like\nMaari, Karuppan, Madan, Madurai Veeran, and Pechi etc.\nThe creation of Hindu religious texts Devaram and\nPrabandam was only to destroy and ruin the principles of\nBuddhism and to establish caste, religion, god and the epics\nand puranas in society.\n[Kudiarasu, 7-10-1928]\nCommunal Representation\nIt must be said, \"books that teach higher and lower must not\nbe read.\" If someone violates and reads, the books must be\nseized. All the heads of religious mutts, who have the\nfeeling of upper and lower must be caught and jailed. If the\npublic launches an agitation, we must send these religious\nheads on exile.\nAll the jewellery, chariots and lands of the Gods must\nbe seized, it should be sold and used to educate the\nuneducated, and provide livelihood to those who lack it. A\nbrave government that will dare to do such activities should\nbe brought to this country.\n\n139\n\n\fWe blame the Brahmins more because only the fire that\nthey ignited has spread among ourselves. If we win the right\nof communal representation in employment by fighting with\nthe upper castes, we must also give the required share to\nthose who are the lower-castes.\nWhat greater reform could be there than giving equality\nto all the communities in the policy of the all-party\nmeeting?\n[Kudiarasu, December 1928]\nSupport of Varnashrama Dharma\nIt is unfortunate to recall that the chief of the Theosophical\nSociety Annie Besant said, \"Adi Dravidas are unclean\npeople and are Untouchables.\" Not only that, she recently\naddressed the university students in Varanasi and spoke on\ncaste differences and Varnashrama dharma. Untouchability\nis supported because of Varnashrama dharma. So how can\nbrotherhood and unity be inculcated or developed?\n[Kudiarasu, 9-12-1928]\nCasteism among Non-Brahmins\nBrahmins discriminate us, the different castes among the\nnon-Brahmins discriminate each other; if the upper castes\nwish to be equal to others they should not discriminate the\nlow castes. You should practice equality. The differences\namong us are crueler than the differences that the Brahmins\npractice (against us). The fire they ignited has captured us.\nIf we fight for communal representation and succeed in it\nwe have given the due share to the low castes.\nThe Nattukkottai Chettiars who earn lot of money as\nprofit spent it on the education of Brahmin by providing\nthem food. Why don't they do the same service to the Adi\nDravidar children? To satisfy their hunger, these small\nchildren go and work as coolies. If such support is extended\nwill they not be educated and become ministers?\n[Kudiarasu, 9-12-1928]\n\n140\n\n\fAbolition of Untouchability\nFor a long time, we have been fighting to prove that\nuntouchability is not justified. We have been explaining that\nit is an atrocity. Yet, it doesn't look like this problem has\nbeen practically eradicated. Where compulsion existed,\nthere it has been removed to an extent. We see that this\nuntouchability takes firm root when we appeal to\nhumaneness/ compassion to end this evil. We are not in\nanyway lesser than others to show that this evil of\nuntouchability is baseless.\nOnly because of a courageous struggle, untouchability\ncan be abolished. They say that \"God is all powerful, he is\nimpartial\" and yet, how shameful it is when they say that\n\"only God is responsible for the cruelty against the\nUntouchables.\" It is also being said that most probably he\nwas the one who created this untouchability. If that is true,\nthen we need to first annihilate that God and only then go\nahead with the next task. If he doesn't know about these\nunjust happenings, we need to annihilate him even sooner.\nIf it is not possible for him to remove this injustice or to\ncontrol those who commit these atrocities, there is no need\nfor him to inhabit any world. It is justifiable to annihilate\nhim.\nIf there is any basis for saying that god or religion does\nnot give way to the eradication of untouchability, then it\nshould also be destroyed with fire no matter who said it or\nwhat it is. Without being firm in the task, and just verbally\nspeaking about the eradication of untouchability, at any\npoint of time our nation cannot attain development because\nof this deceit. If one gets a wound in the eye, do we not\nimmediately use medicine to cure it? If we say that there\nmust be no pain or burning sensation, then it is only a way\nfor one to rot and die.\nEven women are being segregated as an untouchable\nsociety. The eradication of untouchability is our duty. There\nis no other shameless act than following the superstitions\nblindly because someone said so, because it is written\nsomewhere instead of researching and coming to a\nconclusion that as far as intelligence is concerned there is no\n\n141\n\n\fbasis for untouchability. Untouchability is not dependent on\nintelligence or evidence. But, it is only based on\nfoolishness, arrogance, and cheating.\nIf one touches shit, it is enough to rinse off. But if they\ntouch a man they need to bathe. Is it in the name of\nhygiene? Or is it on the basis of arrogance? If they believe\nthe purana that Nandan was made into one of the\nNayanmars and Pannan was made into the Tirupaanazhwar,\nwhy don't they let the brothers and grandchildren of\nNandan into the temples and let them worship? How\ndisgraceful is it to not let the people of the clan of a man\nconsidered as one of the 63 Nayanmars into the temples,\nand to misuse the names of the Nayanmars and Nandan and\nAzhwars in order to eat tamarind rice and pongal under the\npretext of worshipping 63 stone idols?\nAlso, if it is being said that they stink when they come\nnear, who is responsible? There is no place to bathe. They\nshould not come to the roads; they should not come to the\ncommon wells and ponds. They don't have washermen,\nthey don't have barbers. With so much of injustice will they\nsmell fragrant instead of reeking?\nTake the Sankaracharya and close him in a room for\nfifteen days and never let him bathe. Later, see whether he\nsmells fragrant or if he is stinking. Even if God himself is\nnot washed using water for ten days, it will start stinking.\nIt is also being said that they are drinking country liquor\nand arrack and eating meat. Who doesn't drink liquor? Who\ndoes not consume meat? Are they the ones who drink all the\nliquor that is produced? Those who drink and roll in the\nstreets can enter the temples with liquor oozing out of their\nnoses, people of other religions like Christians and Muslims\ncan go halfway inside. But they who are called Hindus must\nalone stand outside the temple. What greater cruelty can be\nthere in our religion?\nDaily we see what the pigs and the hens eat on the\nroads. People who eat pigs and hens are not untouchable.\nBut those who eat the cow, which eats green grass and\ncottonseeds, are untouchable. What is suitable for\nintelligence and justice must alone be accepted. Foolish,\n142\n\n\fmeaningless matters must never be accepted under the name\nof anything. Listen! In other countries, people have started\nbeing indifferent to the atrocities committed in the name of\nGod, or in the name of religion. That is why they have\nattained advancement. I believe that you will not backtrack\nfrom eradicating untouchability that is against intelligence\nand justice.\n[Kudiarasu, 17.2.1929\n10.2.1929, Removal of Untouchability Conference]\nSelf Respect Conference\nThe first Self Respecters conference was held in a grand\nmanner on 7th to 11th of Feb in Chengulpet. It was talked\nabout for 2-3 months and several resolutions were passed.\nAs there was one law for man and another for women, one\nlaw for Brahmin and another law for non-Brahmin, one law\nfor high caste and another for low castes and people suffer\nthe impact, the Self Respect Movement wanted to change\nthis and make equal laws on these inequalities.\nThe caste differences like low or high is a cruelty that\nshould be abolished. This has been accepted by all people in\nseveral fields. But several people do not accept those\nevidences which are against them. On the other hand, in\norder to make the cruelties long-lasting they hold\nconferences in the name of religion, campaign by sending\nmessages to the government which clearly shows that our\ncountry will not easily abolish the cruelties of\nuntouchability. Many do not understand the high-low basis\nof such cruelties. Likewise the Mahatma supports the\ndivisions/differences of Varnashrama dharma. Reformers of\nthe Self \u2013Respect Movement passed a resolution in which\nthe difference in caste system, and religious differences that\nare shown through symbols must be stopped.\nI want to abolish the practice of caste names, titles,\nsymbols denoting particular sects, because in my opinion\nthese have caused among the people an identification of\ncaste, creed, and the real qualities or intellect of a person.\nThis brought about a difference, which was baseless. This is\n\n143\n\n\fone of the reasons for the lack of unity among people. Such\ndifferences and symbols cannot be accepted by anyone who\nwishes for the unity and equality of one and all.\n[Kudiarasu, 24-2-1929]\nCaste Identities\nSince I struggled for unity, someone who became jealous of\nme wrote an editorial about the abolition of caste titles and\nreligious symbols that exhibit differences among people and\nquestioned my participation in caste conferences. I advice\nthat each caste can hold conferences, bring in resolutions to\nabolish the practices in their caste that distinguish them\nfrom other castes and spoils their unity. I said that only for\nsuch purposes one should hold caste conferences. The\nVaishyas can hold the conference and decide in that\nconference that they should not wear the sacred thread and\nshould not call themselves as Vaishyas. Likewise, for castes\nlike Kshatriyas and Nadars.\nIn the Naidu caste conference, I requested them not to\ncall themselves or identify themselves as Kshatriyas. Unless\nsuch conferences are held and resolutions are passed, how\nwill people know about it? Only by going into each caste\nconference, the disease of the particular community can be\ncured. Now they hold Adi Dravidar conferences, which\nhave brought about feelings for their development. Thus if\ncaste difference is to be abolished, caste conferences should\nbe held where resolutions are passed to put an end to the\npractices of caste which distinguish them for others. For\nexample, in the southern states, if we had not held the\nconferences of non-Brahmins we would not have been able\nto know about the cruelties practiced on us by Brahminism.\nBy frequently holding such caste conferences, we can know\nthe problems and sufferings of the other castes so that we\ncan unitedly help them come out of their problems. Except\nthe selfish lazy caste that wants to live and eat on other's\nlabour, one will not think of caste conferences as a danger.\nReligion, Vedas, Sastras and puranas, which support caste\ndifferences, should not be followed. Though this resolution\ncannot be flouted, those who make a living daily in the\n\n144\n\n\fname of Vedas, Sastras and puranas cannot attain\nsatisfaction by these resolutions so they would secretly\nmake all their cunning propaganda.\nThe importance of the resolutions is not to follow the\nprinciples and sources of the Hindu religion. Since most\nimportantly Hindu religion, based on Vedas, Sastras and\npuranas, insists on birth-based caste divisions of low and\nhigh, it is different from other important religions. It is not\nsurprising if one thinks that this resolution blames the\nprinciples of Hindu religion. Hindu religion is not really a\nreligion, and if one thinks that such a thing exists, the\nevidences are based on the selfishness of a few and due to\nour people's ignorance. The practice (of Hinduism) is only a\nconfused feeling and for this confused feeling to be\nannihilated the Hindu religion and the principles which it is\nbased on must be annihilated.\nFor example, no one has replied to the question whether\nthere is any religion like Hinduism. In Gnanasuriyan, it is\nsaid that in the language of some nation, the degraded\npeople called Hindu. That has been mainly used by Muslim\nreligious leaders who say by the term 'Indian' means those\n\"who do not belong to their country\". English called us\nSwadeshi and in Arab and Urdu we were called as Hindu.\nAs there was no name to refer to the Indian People, as there\nwas no name for us in religion or based on our nation or on\ncaste, the name Hindu was used to unite all of us and the\nprinciples of Aryans were named as the Hindu religion.\nThus, this was forced on every Indian. For instance, there is\nno evidence about Hinduism some 400 or 500 years ago.\n[Kudiarasu, 3-3-1929]\nHinduism\nFrom the time the feeling of abolition of caste differences\nand untouchability came; the Brahmins conducted a\nconference on Varnashrama dharma and insisted on the\npractice of untouchability. If the Government tried to\nabolish such practices through law, the Brahmins made\nresolutions that the Government should not interfere in\n\n145\n\n\freligious matters. Common man fears the religious codes\nand shuns any reformation. Having faith in religion, if one\nwishes to make any reformation, no one has so far\nsucceeded even a little till date.\nThus, only using this experience we take up the issue of\nfinding the quality of the Hindu religion and found that this\ngarbage had only garbage and they were useless garbage. Is\nthe principle of Saivaism useful for intellectual research\nand is it based on the feeling of kindness? No, it is not\nfounded on any of these! There are 21 crores of Hindus.\nCan these 5 to 6 crores of Depressed Classes, who are\ntermed as Untouchables, be accepted as Saivaites by the\nSaivaites themselves? They will not even accept them\nsitting by their side and eating food. How can the notion\nthat Saivaite religion is a religion of kindness and is it fit for\nresearch can be accepted? I leave these discussions to the\npublic; let them come to some conclusions.\n[Kudiarasu, 7-4-1929]\nSaivaism\nOnly after the research of Vedachalam and Subramania\nPillai, these Saivaites who treated others worse than dogs\nhave changed a bit. Thus there is some reformation in\nSaivaites only in the past 20 years. Till then, these Saivaites\nwere of the opinion that it is a sin to eat with non-Saivaites\nand their Saivaism lived within the holy ash and the\nrudraksha seeds used by the Saivaites after they were given\ndheeksha by their gurus. These Saivaites did not even\naccept people of other religions as human.\n[Kudiarasu, 7-4-1929]\nVarnashrama Dharma\nIn those times, Kings were instructed to not only create\ndifferences in education and religion but were also forced to\nkeep the castes separately and preach the idea of low and\nhigh castes and about Untouchables and Unseeables and\nassociate each caste with a profession and so on.\n\n146\n\n\fFurther, laws, punishments etc. were only based on it.\nUnless the religious laws in the Indian nation which preach\nlow or high caste or caste differences by birth are refuted\nand abandoned by intellectuals, leaders, great men and\nabove all the common man; our nation cannot get true\nindependence; the nation's self-respect or the religion's\nrespect cannot be attained.\nNow the Brahmins join together, preach and confirm\nabout the righteousness of the Varnashrama Dharma. They\nstate that as per the Laws of Manu, Sudras are created to\nserve Brahmins and they try to establish this. They passed\nresolutions that separate temples must be built for the\nUntouchables. How can Brahmanism be abolished when\nsuch Varnashrama dharma is practiced? How can equality\nbe there? How can unity prevail? How can people live with\nself-respect? These people only spoil India by such acts.\n[Kudiarasu, 14-4-1929]\nSwaraj\nThe word 'desiyam' (nationalism) is to cheat the common\nman for their better living. The Brahmins coined this word\nin order to please the foreigners. Thus this term is used only\nto cheat the non-Brahmins!\nAccording to them, the term nationalism only means\ncheating others without any conscience and leading a life of\ncomfort and pomp at the cost of other's labour. It is not for\nthe growth of education, growth of intellect, growth of\nresearch or for the improvement of technology or for\nequality or unity or for one's own effort or to realize the\ntruth or for not cheating others or for anti-slavery or for\nanti-untouchability or for non-denial of common road/\nlake/well to anyone.\nThe term 'nationalism' was only to practice all the\nabove for the deterioration of the common and poor man.\nInstead of trying to stop the practice of caste and religious\ndifferences, these nationalists try to strengthen and establish\nit. Who protested against the Devasthana bill? Who is the\none against equality? Who is the one supporting prostitution\n\n147\n\n\fdone in the name of god in temples? Who is against equal\nrepresentation to one and all? They are in fact traitors of the\nnation and not nationalists as they call themselves to be!\n[Kudiarasu, 19-5-1929]\nReligious Conversion\nIf people leave Hinduism they should follow some other\nreligion. What religion should be recommended to people?\nChristianity was more like the Brahmin religion, so I\nrecommended Islam to people. Because, in Christianity\nthere are untouchable Christians, Nadar Christians, Vellala\nChristians and so on. So even in Christianity there is\ndifferences followed based on Varnashrama Dharma; so, in\nIndia, it is Hindu Christianity! If the Depressed Classes\nembraced Islam they would get social equality in a very\nshort period.\n[Kudiarasu, 19-5-1929]\nNon-Brahmins and Depressed Classes\nOver the past years, even though I have been invited some\nfour or five times to this Zilla Adi Dravidar Conference, due\nto several reasons I was not able to attend it; so this time, I\ndecided that certainly I had to reach the conference\nsomehow. The leader of the welcoming committee lavished\npraises on me. I will say that so much of praise, other than\nmaking me feel shy, doesn't contain truth. In the matter of\nremoval of untouchability - if there is anything, however\nsmall, that I have contributed, it will be something that has\nbeen done for our benefit, and it cannot be counted as being\ncarried out for your benefit.\nBecause, the common philosophy in social life, of\n'yourselves' and 'ourselves,' does not have even small\ndistinctions. For example, like how you are Untouchables,\nin the same way, even we, who are a little higher class than\nyou, remain Untouchables to one class - that is the\nBrahmin caste which claims itself to be born from God's\nface and talks of itself as the lords of the earth. Although we\nare allowed to go farther than you inside a temple, we have\n\n148\n\n\fto stand behind the Brahmin. When you come into the\ntemple, the temple and the God gets polluted; in the same\nway, if we go to a certain place (in the temple) the temple\nand the God gets polluted. Dining in front of you, dining\nwith you, dining in your homes becomes an evil deed and a\nsin - in the same way, dining in front of us, dining with us,\ndining in our homes is considered a sin for the Brahmins.\nEven where we are addressed by our caste names, we\nare being addressed in a manner more humiliating than you.\nThey address you as Paraiyars and Pallars. Yet, the words\nParaiyar and Pallar only signify your work/occupation and\nthe place that you inhabit. Because of these names,\nParaiyars and Pallars are independent and not fit of\nhumiliation. Whereas, the name with which we are\naddressed, Sudran causes disgrace on our very birth, marks\nus a birth slave to one, as a son of a whore by birth and it\ncarries with it only disgraceful facts. Paraiyan, denoting a\nperson only recognizes him as the son of his lawful parents.\nBut, Sudran means whoreson, prostitute-son, concubineson, birth-slave, purchased slave and is full of several such\nderogatory meanings.\nA section of people like you \u2013 the one being called\nPanchamas, its existence has no place in the Brahminical\nreligion \u2013 that is the Hindu religion. The Hindu religion\ndoes not have any caste less than the Sudras. But, a group\ncalled the 'Chandala' arises out of the living patterns of the\npeople of the four varnas. That is \u2013 children being born to a\nBrahmin male and a non-Brahmin female, Brahmin who did\nnot read the Vedas, doesn't cultivate fire, doesn't perform\nthe sandhya-vandanam, and who doesn't perform such\nrelated Brahminical tasks becomes a Chandala. Several\nBrahmin pundits, with erudition in discourses and expertise\nin the Vedas and Sastras, have confirmed this. So, if\nsomebody says you are a Chandala they must be accepting\nthat you are born of the liaison between a Brahmin male and\na non-Brahmin female or vice versa. Otherwise, they must\naccept that the Brahmins who have slipped from the\nrighteous path are you. If this is so, as on this day, 993\u20444% of\nthe Brahmin society must only be Chandalas. So, in this\n\n149\n\n\fsituation, logically you cannot be faulted since you have a\nplace and plenty of evidence.\nBut our condition is unthinkable, it is a great disgrace.\nThat is why apart from saying that we are lower and more\ndisgraced than you in societal life, I also say that the efforts\nundertaken to remove these disgraces are done more\nimportantly for our section. Apart from this, if anybody has\nthe concern/ anxiety \u2013 at least in small measure \u2013 for\neradicating the current evils for us or for you, certainly it is\nimpossible for him or her unless they are courageously\nprepared to destroy that which is supportive of this\ndemeaning condition. This is because, although it is the\nscoundrel nature of man that has caused this humiliating\nstate, for the purpose of establishing this as a religious tenet\nthey attributed it to someone called the all-powerful God\nand it remains in force now.\nIf this situation has to be slightly changed, the aforesaid\nreligion and God come and interfere. So, the religion that is\nsaid to be the basis for this condition and the God who is\nsaid to have created this religion must be opposed; unless\nwe are ready to answer that. We are courageous and\nprepared to destroy this\u2013 it is impossible by any other path.\nApart from this you also need the feeling of self-respect.\nWhy are we low? Why must we toil for one person? This\nfeeling must come. You must be considered as human\nbeings just like anybody else.\nIf the people of the village torment you or treat you in a\nhumiliating manner, you must stand up to oppose it. If you\ncannot do it, you must migrate to other towns. If you do not\nfind a livelihood even there, you must shake off this cruel\nreligion and go to a religion that has equality. If this is also\nnot possible you must at least go abroad as coolies. If you\ndo not have the guts to handle such sure methods, I will say\nthat the burden thrust on you will not be easily eliminated.\nYou cannot succeed in any work unless you are willing to\nsuffer, to throw away the regulations and to sacrifice your\nlife. Moreover, if you expect someone else will come and\nhelp you it is great foolishness.\n\n150\n\n\fYou must get the courage to use yourselves. Some\npersons are discoursing to you that by getting yourselves\neducated, earning money, bathing, abstaining from drinking\n(alcohol) and by not eating meat your lowness will go. I will\nnot accept these. If these are the reasons for your low status,\nthen why do the others who are also having the same ill\nqualities, instead of reaching your low position remain as\nBrahmins? The only reason for your humiliation and low\ncondition is absence of dignity and self-respect. Consider\nyourselves as human beings just like others; accordingly be\ncourageous to behave like that. Acquire the bravery to bear\nthe difficulties that arise. Soon you will be freed.\n[Kudiarasu, 16-6-1929]\nSelf-respect\nMoreover, you need the feeling of self-respect. Why did we\nbecome Untouchables? Why should we call someone\n'samy' (Lord)? Why should we work for someone? This\nfeeling must come. You must consider that you are also\nhumans like the others.\n[South Arcot Adi Dravidar Conference, 16-6-1929] 6\nResolutions of the Chengulpet conference\n1.\nThere are no differences in castes by birth.\n2.\nReligion, Vedas, Sastras or puranas that teach\ncaste differences should not be followed.\n3.\nThe 4 divisions, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas\nand Sudras; and Panchamas as given by the\nVarnashrama dharma should not be accepted.\n\nMr.Muthusamy, President of the Conference Reception Committee\nspoke: \"Periyar, who has taken a vow to remove the horrible devil called\ncaste, the cruel disease of untouchability, slavishness, poverty from this\ncountry, has renounced his body, property and energy for this and is\nworking night and day and through campaigning against the Injustice of\nManu and Sastra's doctrines and has established equality and\nbrotherhood.\" (Adalarasan, Thanjai; Thanthai Periyarum\nThazhthapattorum, Periyar Self-Respect Propaganda Institution,\nChennai, 2nd Edition, 1992, p. 19)\n6\n\n151\n\n\f4.\n\n5.\n6.\n\nUntouchability among people must be abolished\nand common lakes, wells, schools, street, lodges\nand temples should be given complete and equal\nrights to be used by one and all.\nAs these cannot be attained by campaign, laws\nmust be made to establish these.\nAs caste difference should not be practiced all\nsymbols and caste names should not be used.\n\nIn case of Untouchables, they should be given land, food,\nclothing, and books, good and free education. The\nporomboke lands must be given to them freely. There\nshould be no discrimination in hotels and restaurants.\n[Kudiarasu, 25-8-1929]\nReligion and caste\nPeople are fully aware of the fact that religion is not based\non birth and it is due to their mentality and propaganda.\nFurther they know that any number of religions can be\ncreated. They also know only these people would go and\njoin any newly created religion.\nWhen we look at the Hindu religion and caste, we see\nthat caste is more powerful than religion; for caste is created\nby birth and it is said that it is unchangeable! But religion is\nbased on principles and it can be changed according to\none's mind and heart. So, birth-based caste must be\ncompletely uprooted, all people must join together and be\nmade to live with unity and brotherhood; this is also known\nto people. So what is the problem in uniting people by\ndestroying the caste and Hindu religion?\n[Kudiarasu, 3-11-1929]\nHindu Mahasabha\nFor the poor people who have migrated to Malaysia, South\nAfrica etc. for their living, Brahminism has followed them\nthere also. Even in those countries, Brahmins exploit the\npoor people in the name of god, religion, Sastras and\n\n152\n\n\fPuranas. Whatever evil they have done to the poor in India,\nthey continue to do it in other countries also.\nIn the Hindu Mahasabha, several castes even among the\nHindus were not taken as its members. For example they\ndid not accept the membership of Adi Dravidas,\nMaruthuvars and also Nadars for some time. But when they\naccepted Nadars as members they asked for lot of money\njust for the membership. Many even said that the Hindu\nMahasabha would soon come to ruin and so they did not\nrespect it.\n[Kudiarasu, 9-2-1930]\nAbolishing Caste Discrimination\nThis political decision assembly that makes rules and\nregulations in independent India should have amended/\nbanned the foundations that caused discrimination and\ndivision by birth as Brahmins, Sudras, Panchamas and\nHarijans.\nThey should have made a statement to this effect\nbanning all differences based on birth. Can we say that their\nunconcern and indifference about such discrimination is due\nto the lack of concern about their low caste status? It can\nnever be said so. But, Brahmins made them members of this\npolitical party only on the condition that they would not\nprotest about the low caste disgrace or discrimination.\n[Viduthalai, 7-8-1930]\nSimon Commission\nBy the polices of the Simon Commission and the\ninformation given by Chakravarthy, the cruelties of caste\ndifferences, gender differences, rich-poor differences,\nlandlord\u2013farmer differences and above all cruelties\npracticed in the name of religion that have a strong\nfoundation, have not been destroyed or thrown away. On\nthe other hand, the policy of Simon Commission and\nChakravarthy has only made the three categories of people:\nBrahmins, rich and educated to lead a more comfortable\n\n153\n\n\flife. The poor farmer and the coolies who form 90% of the\npopulation have not benefited even a little!\n[Kudiarasu, 23-11-1930]\nAbolishing Caste Discrimination\nIf we analyze the caste system formed by the Brahmins, it is\nnot based on rationalism or common sense and there is no\ndignity or self-respect for the Sudras.\nAccording to the Brahmins, the Sudras are the people of\nthe fourth caste who traditionally commit do mistakes or\nsins. What is said in the Dharmasastras is quoted here: \"A\nbathed horse, an infatuated elephant, a lusty bull and a\nSudra who is educated should not be kept near. Further, the\nVedas say that women and Sudras should never perform\nprayers, penance, pilgrimage, sanyas, singing the praise of\ngod.\nFurther it is said in the Vedas that a Sudra should not\ntake bath before sunrise, should not pray, they should not\nread the Sastras. Likewise, thousands of rules and\nregulations are written on how a Sudra should lead his life\nonly as a slave.\nIf we are really interested in the complete freedom or\ndemocracy of India-at first, even before the British quit\nIndia, i.e. in the rule of the British itself, we should ask\nthem to make rules that will annihilate all caste differences.\nInstead, if we ask them to leave our land, it is just like\ndrinking poison for our own deaths because 999 out of 1000\nIndians are not interested in abolishing caste differences, on\nthe other hand each caste strives to make itself superior,\nwhich is done by making some caste to be lower to them. If\nthe rule is in the hand of casteist people, caste cruelties will\nnever be banished!\n[Kudiarasu, 30-11-1930]\nCow Slaughter\nMany Naidus, Gounders, and Iyers say that they are of\nhigher caste than the Paraiyars and the Chakkiliyars. They\nsay that the lower birth is due to the deeds of previous birth.\n\n154\n\n\fBased on this, they deny the Paraiyars and Chakkiliyars\ntheir due freedom and liberty. All this is due to caste,\nreligion and god. Sankaracharya says that killing a cow is\nwrong. He does not seek protection for all animals, but only\nfor the cow. No one kills a cow that gives milk. They kill\nonly old cows that don't give milk. Ninety-five percent of\npeople in the world live on beef. If they want a law against\ncow slaughter and they go on a fast for this end; I feel that it\nlooks like an act of madness. If the poor should eat meat, it\ncan only be beef because it is cheap. Only this beef contains\nmore proteins for the poor.\nTo say that the cow should not be killed because it feeds\nonly on grass and vegetation, and that it does not eat insect\netc. looks even more foolish.\n[Kudiarasu, 11-1-1931]\nHinduism and Caste\nFrom the time the feelings of God came into being in this\nnation, the feeling of low caste and high caste also came\ninto being. No one can deny the caste discrimination and\ncaste cruelties prescribed in the Laws of Manu.\n[Kudiarasu, 11-1-1931]\nHinduism and Caste\nTo hear about the cruelty wreaked on the Adi Dravidar\nsociety by persons belonging to other castes makes me\nangry. But while thinking about who is responsible for this,\nI come to the conclusion that those who torment you are not\nthe ones responsible; because they are doing it in the name\nof their belief, in the name of their religious feelings, in the\nname of their devotion to the basis of their religion, in the\nname of freedom of karma of the previous birth\u2013purva\npunyam\u2013fate, they are only exercising their right to do so\nand nothing else. In the same way, when subjected to\nbrutality by others even you just think of it \u2013 that too only\nduring that particular instant\u2013as something atrocious and\ncruel.\n\n155\n\n\fYou fail to deliberate upon issues like: 'what is the\nreason for that? Why does such an atrocious and cruel act\ntake place? How to destroy this totally? What should be\ndone?' If someone else points this out, you do not\ncourageously undertake to accept it and put it into practice.\nPointlessly, during such an occasion when some of you\nindividually face troubles\u2013instead of paying attention to the\nbasis of the problem\u2013you shout one or two words and throw\nthe blame on a particular individual or section, after the\npassage of four days this fades away and everything goes on\nas usual. Under the guise of speaking in your favour, even\nsome 'persons of esteem' in public life talk a few words and\nthen return to their jobs and live casually as always.\nNo matter what, when human freedom like walking on\nroads, drawing water from ponds, and touching fellow\nhuman-beings is being banned to a person in his own\ncountry, is it not funny to ask for freedom to govern from\npeople of other countries?\nYou must get human freedom. If not, one must not\nremain in this country or religion or society. Other than this\ndecision, if we think it is enough to somehow manage to\nlive and continue in this manner it is shameless nature.\nIn these matters, it is cowardice to think of tolerance.\nHow many days to endure this? How slow to go? Several\npeople have argued for this over thousands of years. So\nmany people have finished talking on dharma and justice.\nAll that could only strengthen the prevailing condition. Like\nthe proverb, quote Tamil original ('Biting the hide and\nbiting the bellows, the dog became a hound'), nationalism\ndemands political freedom and on the other hand, it takes\nsteps to attain Swaraj based on Varnashrama dharma.\nEven in this giddy state, accompanied by a yearning for\nawakening, meetings are held to demand 'Caste differences\nare needed. Paraiyar is needed. Manu dharma is needed'.\nThe humiliation that has been imposed on us and on you\nmust be eradicated. For that, you and your family must be\nready to sacrifice your lives!\n\n156\n\n\fIn today's world, several nations have decided that even\nthe difference of rich-poor must not be there, and they are\nsuccessfully working towards (putting an end to) it. At such\na time, if you are having the principle 'Brahmin caste and\nPariah caste; if one sees\u2013touches\u2013 walks on the streets it is\npolluting', think of the differences in thought between the\nforeign countries and us!\nThese thoughts are arising in you because of your\nignorance that is founded on your belief in religion and\nGod. So, chase them away. Then you will get self-respect\nand social equality.\n[Kudiarasu, 11-3-1931]\nRacism and Casteism\nThe 'racial arrogance' that is the cause of sorrow of the\nNegroes in America is also the cause for untouchability in\nour country. This was a reason why the Aryans-who\nmigrated to our country in ancient times-degraded the\nindigenous native tribal people as Asuras, Rakshashas,\nMlechas, Panchamas, and Sudras. Untouchability, like the\nwooden steps of a ladder, has afflicted every person in this\ncountry. The Indian leaders who speak about destroying\nuntouchability do not wish to destroy varnashrama dharma.\n[Kudiarasu, 12-4-1931]\nUntouchability\nIt is a fact said by all the people and political sociologists,\nand accepted by the public that the cruelties which are being\ncommitted in India due to untouchability-people not\ntouching people- is a very big cruelty far worse than all\nthe cruelties in the world and no other cruelty can be\nmentioned on par with it. But, it is evident to one's eyes that\nno person takes any effort to use this fact in any manner.\nInstead they simply speak empty rhetoric to cheat people\nand pass the time.\nIn a way, because of the agitations of the Self-respect\nmovement and the extreme emotions that have arisen in the\nUntouchables a kind of flutter has been created among the\n\n157\n\n\fpublic and it looks like there won't be much value for\nopposing this. So, the non-Brahmin leaders and cadres of\nthe Congress, must independently come together at least at\nthis juncture-and also involve people of other\nmovements-to come forward and take up some efforts! In\nthis context, those who are said to be Untouchables must\nsuitably agitate or leave the Hindu religion that is the basis\nof untouchability, or take efforts to eradicate their\ndisgraceful positions and cruelties. It is necessary that those\nwho are called Untouchable in every place must jointly\ncome to some decision, instead of expecting that extremist\nefforts would be undertaken by the English-educated or\nwealthy among them who expect jobs, appointments etc.\n[Kudiarasu, 24-5-1931]\nHinduism and Caste\nThe evil they (Brahmins) do to non-Brahmins in the name\nof Hinduism is less than the evil they do to Muslims and\nChristians. But the cruelties they do to the Untouchables are\ngreater than everything. The Hindu religion indirectly helps\nin the flourishing of both Christianity and Islam. So it is a\nprofit for these two religions. So it is more important only\nfor the non-Brahmins and Untouchables to destroy Hindu\nreligion.\n[Kudiarasu, 7-6-1931].\nCongress and Untouchability\nOf what use is the Swaraj that cannot bear to inflict\nanyone's feelings? It may claim itself to be independent. It\nis of good use for the Brahmins who can lead a comfortable\nlife than before. But what is the plight of a Pariah? He\ncannot even have the right to walk in all streets. What is the\nplight of Sudra? He should do physical labour to satisfy the\nBrahmins. If a Pariah walks in the public streets, the\nfeelings of Brahmins are hurt!\nOnce Jawaharlal said when he was talking with the\nBrahmins that no ones liberty would be affected or snatched\naway by Swaraj. But soon after he spoke in another\n\n158\n\n\fgathering that the temples that does not allow the\nUntouchables would be razed. Gandhi also supports this.\nOnce I had gone to Dindugul with Srinivasa Iyengar on\na Congress campaign and had to go to a Brahmin's house. I\nwas given food in a different place outside the house and\nthe leaf from which I ate in the morning was not cleared and\nin the same place, close to it, I was served supper also.\nLikewise, once I had been to Tanjore with Venkatasamy\nfor some Congress campaigning in Periyakulam. We\nalighted in a Brahmin lawyer's house. We were served\nbreakfast in plantain leaves, outside the house, in an\nadjoining platform. These leaves were not removed and it\nwas full of ants and flies. The same night, we were both\nserved dinner near these leaves. I did not mind all this and\nworked for the Congress. So, if the Congress says that they\ndon't practice caste differences, no one can believe it!\n[Kudiarasu, 12-7-1931]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nUnder any circumstance, if we expect samadharma\n(equality) from Gandhi only we would become fools. Till\nthe end of our life we cannot see the samadharma or unity in\nhim.\nHe considers only the rich northerners and the southern\nBrahmins as humans. He mainly has their friendship. He\nthinks only of their problems as the international problems.\nAll his plans are only to solve the problem of these two\ngroups. But for the poor and low caste people to develop, he\nknows only two ways. One is spinning and the other is that\nthe practice of untouchability is a sin. Even these two things\nwould only become a philosophy in the presence of millowners and Brahmins.\n[Kudiarasu, 26-7-1931]\nReligious Conversion\nWhen I advised the Untouchables to join Islam several of\nthem got angry with me. I did not get angry with them.\n\n159\n\n\fI did not ask the Depressed Classes to join Islam to get\nheaven or mental satisfaction or to reach god, I mainly\nasked them to join Islam to destroy untouchability. It is just\nlike doing Satyagraha. Even now I profess it.\nIt is difficult to make laws. Even if it is made it is\ndifficult to be practiced. Because of this, one may get\nsorrow and defeat. But there is no difficulty for the\nDepressed Classes to convert to Islam. To follow this, there\nis no defeat or sorrow. What is the difficulty faced by\nothers?\nWhat is the problem whether one is an atheist or theist?\nNobody suffers because of this! Even if he is a true Muslim\nor a false Muslim nobody is troubled by it! Even one need\nnot have any mental change!\nA person who wants to wipe off the disgrace and\ndishonour he suffers; if he converts to Islam at 5 p.m. he can\nwalk in any street freely at 5.30 pm and he is free from the\nclutches of untouchability. What is wrong in becoming\nhuman?\nWhy should one not convert to Christianity or to Arya\nSamaj? I do not know what is said about Christianity in the\nBible. But in practice they have in India especially, Paraiyar\nChristian, Nadar Christian etc.! Does the Muslim\ncommunity have such differences? The Christians should\nnot get angry with me.\nArya Samaj is hypocrisy. Because, in the Vaikom\nSatyagraha, the Arya Samaj Untouchables and the Pulayan\nChristians were not allowed to walk on the road near the\ntemples. But the Muslims walked freely.\nFor instance, a Cheruman, an untouchable who\nconverted to Islam walked along the road banned for\nUntouchables.\nA Brahmin and a Nair came to the street and looked at\nhim. A Muslim asked them, \"Why do you sons-of-aprostitute-pig look at him?\" They bent their heads in shame\nand this untouchable walked on, smiling in that road.\n[Kudiarasu, 2-8-1931]\n\n160\n\n\fCaste System\nAn idli-vendor Brahmin's son can become a High Court\nJudge. A horoscope-making Brahmin's son can become a\nminister. But think if a scavenger's son can become a\nJudge? That is the power of caste system.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-9-1931]\nCaste and Class\nThe caste system, which preaches low and high castes, acts\nas a supporting fort to the notion of rich and poor.\n[Kudiarasu, 4-10-1931]\nAdi Dravidars and non-Brahmins\nWe are uniting caste. Yes, we are trying. There is no doubt\nin that, but whether it will be done soon is a doubt. The\nhuman caste has to become one. We are boldly saying that\nthose who prevent it are scoundrels and fools. We are being\nasked if we will give our daughters to Paraiyans.\nThis is a foolish question; I might say that it is a roguish\nquestion. This is because we are only going to make our\ndaughters live with their loved one, and we are not people\nwho will exercise the right of giving our daughters to men\nwhom we like. The practice of considering women as\nobjects and 'giving them to someone' must be eradicated;\nwe are striving for it.\nFriends! When we are speaking of Adi Dravidars, there\nis sense in the Brahmins getting mentally grieved. But, there\nis no meaning in the non-Brahmins getting upset. It is just\nplain foolishness and shamelessness. Because, in our\nsociety, apart from the Brahmin caste that constitutes 3% of\nthe population, can the rest of the population have any\nclassificatory title other than Sudra and Adi Dravidar?\nPlease consider this, which is also based on your\nexperience!\nIf you believe that without the label of Paraiyan being\nremoved, the Sudra label will go away, then you are\ndownright idiots.\n\n161\n\n\fBesides, if I talk at length, I would say that there is no\nevidence anywhere on who is a Paraiyan or Chakkiliyan and\nwhat their rights are! It is nothing but a show of strength\nand tactics. It is possible for the title of Paraiyan to\ndisappear in a short while. The Sudra title given to you has\nmany evidences\u2013God, religion, Vedas, Sastras, puranas,\nhistory etc. Unless all these are completely destroyed you\ncannot expect the Sudra title on your head to get down. So,\nif anyone has a feeling of dignity, they wouldn't have asked\nus, 'You are uniting the castes!'\nAs a result, do realize that the speeches addressed\nregarding the benefit of Adi Dravidars and the efforts\ninitiated for them are for the welfare of all non-Brahmins.\n[Kudiarasu, 11-10-1931]\nCommunal Representation\nWhat is wrong if any man asks for power sharing by saying\nthat his religion is a minority, his caste is powerless and\nlow; hence clearly ensures his share in the rule and sees to it\nthat you do not suppress them by your rule? If anyone asks\nlike this, they say labeled traitors to the nation? What can\nwe say about these people? If one asks his share in his\nnation he is termed as traitor. All families that do not give\nthe proper share to its members have come to ruin so if the\nshare were denied or cheated out of any individual, religion\nor community, it is certain that such a nation would be\nruined. At present in our nation, certainly one cannot refute\nthe demonstrations carried against communal representation\nin such institutions.\n[Kudiarasu, 8-11-1931]\nAbolition of Castes\nIf we just abandon the Brahmins, then what about the\nSaivaites? Can they be there? They are also just like the\nBrahmins! So, all people who claim to be 'upper' caste are\nthose who do not do any physical work but live on others'\nlabour.\n\n162\n\n\fCastes should be abolished. A law should be made that\neverybody should toil physically. Without toil, there must\nbe no place in this nation. Only then the Brahmin will get\naway and all the cruelties that are being practiced will go\naway. But keep in mind that there is another group which\nlives on the labour of others and which practices caste\nsystem. And it is this group that protected the Brahmins.\nThey are the rich people, the capitalist, and the mirasdhars\n(landlords). They should also be reformed or annihilated.\n[Kudiarasu, 5-3-1933]\nCongress and Untouchability\nIf the British rule were also based on Sanatana Dharma or\non Manu Dharma, then certainly the notion of nationalism,\nlaw and non-cooperative movement would have flown\naway. For this reason, Gandhi was made Mahatma.\nAs the reputation and power of Gandhi lessened, he\njoined the anti-untouchability protest and temple-entry\nmovement to renew his popularity. This caused some\nfriction with Brahmins. That is why the Brahmin\nnationalists A. Rangasamy Iyengar, Satyamoorthy and K.\nBashyam and others became silent. It has become very\ndifficult to find Satyamoorthy's whereabouts. He became a\nfull-time contractor to Raja Sir Annamalai Chettiar. So he\nwas earning a lot. Rangasamy Iyengar became a full\nsupporter of Sankaracharya so he earned money and fame!\n[Kudiarasu, 19-3-1933]\nChristianity and Caste\nYour priests know that you do not have the feeling of selfrespect because of the madness of religion. They know that\nyou will not do anything against their authority. For the\nsake of religion and God, you will bear any amount of\nsorrow and disgrace and will be speaking something merely\norally-but any day you will not agree to transgress the\nregulation, or shake away or try to destroy the cause of your\nhumiliation.\n\n163\n\n\f[Kudiarasu, 7-5-1933; Lalgudi Taluk\nChristians Conference, 23-4-1933]\n\nAdi\n\nDravidar\n\nGandhi and Untouchability\nThe efforts of Gandhi were only to establish Brahminism\nand richness. That is the only thought that dominated his\nrich Brahmin disciples. The main reason that established\nsuch actions of Gandhi are: the discovery of spinning wheel\nfor the poor, Bhagavad Gita for the Brahmins' existence,\npractice of caste system and varnashrama dharma in all\ntypes of industries and their representation in Swaraj. In the\nRound Table Conference, the acceptance of the Indian\nsamasthana rulers (traditional kings) and zamindars\nestablished his intentions.\nWhen asked why he had started the \"salt satyagraha\",\nhe said, \"If I don't start it, the nation would have faced a\nstrong agitation towards establishing communism.\" Because\nof this, the rich lavishly supported and helped Gandhi.\nNot only that, they said that they had abolished the low\ncastes and started a Harijan Sevak Sangh by getting lakhs of\nrupees from rich industrialists like Birla. They purchased a\nfew Untouchables. They did service only to the Hindu\nsociety by campaigning for puranas. They said that\naccording to puranas, we were to work for others.\n[Kudiarasu, 23-7-1933]\nCongress and Untouchability\nThe Congress has not in anyway helped the poor,\ndowntrodden people who toil like animals for over 14 to 18\nhours in the rain or shine, forests, fields, hills, seas,\nworkshops, industries and business centres. They don't have\nproper food, sanitation, medical aid, support for their\nchildren's education, proper clothes or proper house to stay;\nthey live in broken huts, and die of poverty and starvation.\nThere is no one to question this. What is the change that has\ntaken place after Congress has come to power?\nIf the Indian National Congress served as the\nestablishment for prostitution, no one can deny it.\n\n164\n\n\fEverybody should accept it because in the name of the poor\nand ignorant, the atrocities and the cruelties the Congress\nhad done to them knows no bounds.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-7-1933]\nCaste and Class\nIn any nation, can the rich and the upper castes alone remain\nin a flourishing state, and the people who labour and are\npoor remain in a declining and degrading state? If any such\ninstitution or state or nation dies, the people would only be\nhappy about it and they would by no means try to help it\ngrow.\nIn fact they would bury it in a deep pit and it is the\nardent duty of the intellectuals who seek equality to erect a\nheadstone over it.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-7-1933]\nSamadharma\nSamadharma (lit. all are equal) is above caste, religion,\nnation and varna and it is has destroyed the castes: Brahmin,\nKshatriya, Vaishya, Sudra and Panchama. It has no\ndifference between rich and poor, employee and employer,\nlandlord and farmer. Samadharma annihilates all such\nnotions. It has broken the mean notions of high and low\ncaste, or rich and poor etc. based on karma. According to\nSamadharma, all are equal, everything is common, no\ndifference exists and no caste or religion exists, in the world\neverybody is a comrade.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-7-1933]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nWhen Gandhi entered politics he chiefly spoke about social\nreforms: he said that we would not get Swaraj without the\nabolition of untouchability; we would not get Swaraj\nwithout the Hindu-Muslim unity, we would not get Swaraj\nwithout the abolition of alcholic drinks. He said that in\nevery house spinning should be taken up as a compulsory\n\n165\n\n\fwork without which we would not get Swaraj. As days went\nby, he talked about the eradication of untouchability on one\nside but on the other, he supported varnashrama dharma.\nHe said the divisions of caste must exist; only the\ndifference of high or low caste should not exist. He said that\nyou couldn't become a Brahmin unless you are born a\nBrahmin. Then he said that if we get Swaraj, untouchability\nwould go away by itself, automatically.\nLastly, because of the demonstrations by the SelfRespecters, even after getting their communal\nrepresentation of reservation, the Untouchables have\nestablished a forum to fight for temple-entry. The\ndemonstration started with fast and now it had gone to the\nassembly for making some laws. So it was decided that until\nsome laws are passed they couldn't enter temples.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-8-1933]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nGandhi's plan to drive away the devil of untouchability is\nonly to make the religion pure and that has no relation with\nany feeling of sadness over untouchability. He ventured to\nmake the Hindu religion pure because it should not come to\na state of being ridiculed as a religion with flaws, since that\nwould quickly destroy the Hindu religion. To save the\nHindu religion, Gandhi was made Mahatma and by these\nacts, the Brahmins were able to collect lots of money to fill\ntheir stomach.\nGandhi had said over thousand times that the removal\nof untouchability is not a common dharma in the Hindu\nreligion. Can the common man not follow that?\nSo, is the removal of untouchability only a religious\ncampaign? Gandhi met people of different castes many\ntimes and has said that the caste differences are very\nessential and each caste should do only the profession of\ntheir forefathers. So, he had come to this Ashram and taught\nUntouchables the art of tanning cowhide.\nI will bet that Gandhi has not till date spoken about the\ndestruction of different castes but he always wanted the\n\n166\n\n\fdifferent castes viz. Brahmin, Kshtriya, Vaishya and Sudra;\nand the fifth caste of Chandalas, he wanted it merged with\nthe Sudras.\nWhen asked what is the place of Untouchables in the\nHindu religion, Gandhi said that they should be combined\nwith Sudras and the Sudras will continue to be\nUntouchables. The orthodox and people who follow Hindu\ndharma are better than Gandhi because the venom in them is\nwell known even to fools and blinds; but the venom in\nGandhi was sugarcoated so even an intellectual would eat it\nwithout doubt.\nThe venom of the orthodox will not kill the person who\nconsumes it but the venom used by Gandhi was so\nsugarcoated that it will kill several generations. The\ncampaign of Gandhi was more venomous than that of the\nfollowers of Manu.\n[Puratchi, 10-12-1933]\nCow worship\nHindus means they will worship cows and they will show\nboundless respect to it. If anyone kills a cow or eats cow's\nmeat the Hindus will be cruel to them and hate them. That is\nwhy they hate Muslims. That is why often there are HinduMuslim clashes. Among Hindus, the Paraiyars and\nChakkiliyars are termed low castes because they eat beef.\nBased on these, several Sastras are written.\nBut these Hindus treat the bulls very cruelly. Bulls are\nused to pull carts, plough fields, pull water from wells and\nrun the oil press. When the bulls are young, they castrate it\nin a very barbaric way. The amount of love and respect they\nshow to the cow is not shown even to humans!\nIf the acts like the abolition of untouchability and\ntemple entry to all is brought out as laws, they felt it will be\na danger to orthodoxy according to Hindu scriptures. So,\nthey are performing yagnas to escape that. This Hindu\northodoxy is very dangerous to non-Brahmins and it favours\nonly the Brahmins. This is against everybody's self-respect.\n\n167\n\n\fThat which was once considered to be civilization is\nnow being ridiculed. For example, actions such as putting\ncaste tags behind the name, wearing the sacred thread, using\nreligious marks on the forehead are criticized for being\ncontradictory to progressiveness.\n[Puratchi, 10-6-1934]\nPress\nThe main failure of the Round Table Conference, the\ndisparity of people in political reform, the lack of faith\nbetween Hindus and Muslims, the differences between the\nCongress and Muslim league, the Untouchables seeking\nseparate electorates are all due to religion and caste\ndifferences.\nKudiarasu was stopped because we wrote about\nChristianity and the magazine Puratchi was stopped\nbecause we wrote about Islam. Because we write about\nHindu religion, the daily torture we undergo is innumerable.\nOfficers from Brahmin community in the fields of police,\nrailways, law and establishment trouble and torture us\nlimitlessly.\n[Pagutharivu, 9-9-1934]\nNon-Brahmin Representation\nThe officials should supervise and ensure that non-Brahmin\nrepresentation is duly given. For instance, if a Brahmin is a\nDeputy Collector, they should see to it that the Tahsildar is\na non-Brahmin, likewise if a Brahmin is a District Judge\nthan the sub-judge must be a non-Brahmin, it should be so\nin all power/ posts. If such a format were not followed, only\nthe casteist emotions would dominate all spheres of life.\nNow, there is some awareness among us for instance in\nthe municipal elections. In Salem and Tirupur that was the\nbase of Brahmins, not a single Brahmin could come to\npower. One can now see the status of the Congress and the\nBrahmins!\n[Pagutharivu, 30-9-1934]\n\n168\n\n\fSwaraj and Caste\nEven if a good General comes to the nation, the job of a\nscavenger will continue to be so: this was the dharma\npracticed by the nationalists and Mahatmas as Swarajya\ndharma.\nBritish rule was better than Swaraj (Self-Rule). Because\nin the British Raj, a scavenger may become a minister; but\nin Swaraj that forces hereditary profession by no means will\nmake a scavenger into a minister. That is why I want to be a\ntraitor; I want to be an anti-Swarajist. I am not an enemy of\nthe law that will destroy the difference between Brahmin\nand Pariah and profess equality among them and the Swaraj.\nI am not talking about this only in the Indian context but as\nthe person who has analyzed it in the international context.\nIn every nation there is difference between poor-rich\nand capitalist-labourer but in no nation there is BrahminPariah, low caste-high caste. These meaningless differences\nare created by caste culprits who demand Swaraj but are\nuninterested in destroying these differences. Until\neverybody is united under the banner of humane existence, I\nwould like to be a traitor than accept the fraud of\nnationalism and Swaraj.\n[Pagutharivu, 21-10-1934]\nCommunal Representation\nTill date, the main goal of national heroes, nationalists and\nCongressmen was to be in good posts. They worked only\nbased on that goal. But, when the non-Brahmins took the\nsame mode of work they were called traitors. For, if there\nwas communal representation, the Brahmins could enjoy\nonly a certain amount of money. If the rule of communal\nrepresentation is practiced then there will be no need for the\nJustice Party.\nWhoever does any type of national service, even if it is\nGandhi himself, without communal representation such\nservice cannot be legal, proper or done with integrity.\n\n169\n\n\fTill the Untouchables and Backward classes continue to\nhave poor or less representation in all posts, I would support\nthem and will also be a traitor; because caste and equality in\nrepresentation alone is the biggest thing for me. A group\nthat labours is starving; conversely, another group is eating\nstomachful without doing any work. And the oppression by\nhigh castes and caste differences are so much that one is not\nable to tolerate them. How can one tolerate all these and\nremain a patriot?\n[Pagutharivu, 9-9-1934]\nHinduism and Caste Differences\nAn untouchable Chokhamela, a Vaishnava devotee was not\nallowed into the temple. Vishnu himself led Chokhamela\ninto the temple. Likewise in Saivaism, Nandan was taken\ninto the temple. So the communal and caste differences in\nboth Vaishnavism and Saivaism remain the same.\n[Pagutharivu, 1935]\nSectarianism\nWe cannot consider sectarianism to be annihilated if the\nsectarian differences and disagreements such as BrahminNon-Brahmin, touchable-untouchable are solved. Who can\ncontradict that sectarianism is rampant, both openly and as\nan internal consideration in today's politics?\n[Kudiarasu, 26-5-1935]\nCommunal Representation\nThe Justice Party was created only to fight for communal\nrepresentation. The revolutionaries Dr. Nair and S.P.\nThiyagarayar, staunch Congressmen and nationalists were\nthe main reason for creating the Justice Party. They wanted\ncommunal representation in education, science, technology\nand employment. Their main aim was to struggle for\nadvancement of the Depressed and Backward classes. This\nparty is a non-Brahmin Party.\n[Kudiarasu, 23-6-1935]\n\n170\n\n\fCongress and Untouchability\nIn 1920, Gandhi collected a fund amounting to 1 crore\nrupees in the name of Swaraj Fund-this amount was spent\nonly for Brahmin domination and their welfare. Once again\nin the year 1926-27, Kadhar (handspun cloth) Fund was\ncollected amounting to 30 lakh rupees. This was also spent\nonly for the betterment of Brahmins and they grew richer.\nFinally in 1934, Harijan fund was collected in the name of\nUntouchables. Around 20 to 30 lakh rupees were collected\nand it was also given to Brahmins to perpetrate their\ndomination.\nThe village rehabilitation fund will also be only spent in\nthe same way as the above three funds were spent. There\ncan be no doubt about it. What was done for Untouchability\nwas that they made it clear that no law should be brought\nagainst abolition of Untouchability. It ended with a slogan\nthat people should eat hand-pounded rice and jaggery. Be\nvery cautious about this collection of funds since it would\nmake only the rich and the Brahmins economically\npowerful.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-6-1935]\nUntouchability Eradication\nUnless religion is banished, untouchability will never be\nbanished. If the Untouchables need some liberty it should be\ngot only from the government i.e., law. So I advice them to\nget their freedom from the British rule since any other rule\nin the ancient days did not help them to come out of\nuntouchability. Do not involve yourself in the\ndemonstrations conducted by rich or other caste people. It is\ndone only for their improvement.\n[Kudiarasu, 28-7-1935]\nHinduism and Untouchability\nIf we see with a true consideration that the Depressed\nClasses must be liberated from the atrocities heaped on\nthem by other people, it is the work of a revolution because\n\n171\n\n\fthe position of the Depressed Classes has been built on a\ngreat foundation. It has been built on such a strong\nfoundation that the Depressed Classes, the people of the\nlower castes and those who are called Untouchables have\nattained the inferior quality in their birth itself. They were\nmade to be born in such situation by God itself and that the\nactions of God and the rules of religion must not be changed\nby anyone and that it is not amenable to change.\nIf someone thinks the oppressed people can attain\nequality and the doctrine of untouchability can be removed\nfrom the society, because of mere words or propaganda, or\nby requesting the upper castes, I will only say that their life\nis a waste.\nA few people of the Depressed classes and the\nUntouchables think that if they bathe and apply sacred ash,\nwear a pattai or naamam (marks on the forehead to indicate\ntheir religion) as per the customs, act like the orthodox, say\nthat they do not drink or eat meat, roam about naming\nthemselves 'samy'-their position will improve and that\nUntouchability will be eradicated. This is the madness of\ntrying to cheat others and cheating themselves.\nFor a longtime we have seen many people act in this\nmanner among the Depressed Classes, among the Adi\nDravidars. There are several puranic and historic evidences\nfor that.\nWe can say with courage that from thousands of years\nago till now, in the matter of annihilation of Untouchability\nno work has been completed. The work of a few magicians\ncould be used for selfishness; because of those garbs and\npiety no work took place. So, if God and religion and its\nbasis-the Gita and Manu dharma Sastra are to be saved,\nthink over of how the Sudra quality and the low-caste\nquality and untouchability can be changed?\nToday, cent percent of those who are involved in the\nwork of removal of untouchability and eradication of caste\ndiscrimination are idiots who believe in the Gita and the\nManu dharma Sastras. For how many ever days they work,\nthey will only be like fools who try to fill up water in pots\nthat are broken. So, for the annihilation of untouchability or\n172\n\n\fthe annihilation of caste, first you have to annihilate your\nreligion.\nIf you are not able to annihilate your religion, at least\nyou must come out of the religion. Without your religion\ngoing, your untouchability or the pariah-hood will never be\neradicated, this is a fact as firm as stone. If you want an\nexample, those who were Untouchables in the human\nsociety could become touchable only when they shook off\nthe religion that was imposed on them. So, do not think that\nreligion can be protected and untouchability can also be\neradicated and thus be cheated.\n[Kudiarasu, 28-7-1935]\nVarnashrama Dharma\nHow the kings ruled in the ancient days can be seen from\nthe dramas staged by them in those days. In the scenes of\nthe play, the king will ask his ministers, \"Did you lavishly\ngive the Brahmins subsidy, free distribution of food, Vedic\nschools? Are they happy without any mental strain? Do the\nother caste people serve them without any problem?\" Thus\nthe rule of kings was nothing but only the rule of\nvarnashrama dharma.\n[Kudiarasu, 8-9-1935]\nPatriotism\nIn today's context, patriotism is based only on money and\nBrahmin campaign and not for the welfare of the commoner\nor to make amendments for some need or wrong in the\nsocial set up. The Brahmins have isolated themselves from\nsociety by the status that they are the only high caste and\nGod created all other castes only to serve them.\nLikewise the capitalists and rich think that they are\ndifferent from the others and God has made them rich and it\nis their right to pay the workers what they feel like paying\nthem.\nThe only difference between these two sets of people is\nthat a Brahmin gets work done without paying them and the\nrich or capitalists gets work by paying them with what they\n\n173\n\n\flike and both feel they are created by god. Thus these two\ngroups form the nation's patriots.\n[Kudiarasu, 29-9-1935]\nPoona Pact\nIn the reforms offered by the Government, there were\nreforms with self-respect for you. That was spoiled by the\npatriotic reform called the Poona Pact. It is surprising for\nme that a few of you support the Poona Pact. The reason\nthey give for that is very, very surprising. That is, you need\nto go and seek votes from the upper castes. The upper castes\nneed to come to you and seek votes. It seems a mutual\nfeeling will be created. This is like a mynah-catching stunt\nand there is no credibility or intelligence in this. If you have\nto enter an administrative office where a Brahmin is the\nauthority you need a government order, and to walk in the\npublic streets you need a law in the Penal code. Is it\npossible for you to go to walk into the agraharam (Brahmin\nsettlement), cross the threshold of their homes, and ask for\nvotes from a Brahmin who is lying on a couch and stroking\nhis stomach.\n[Presidential Address in Rasipuram Adi Dravidar\nConference, 29-9-1935]7\nCongress and Untouchability\nOur people have not realized the nature of Brahmin\nconspiracy against the annihilation of caste.\nGandhi works for the eradication of untouchability. But\nhe doesn't change his opinion that the Depressed Classes\nmust stitch slippers, they must work with hide. Our\nCongress enthusiasts worked against untouchability. They\ncollected money. They used that money and caught\n7 Rettamalai Srinivasan speaks on 6-5-1937: One has to remember that\nwhen Periyar was in Europe, he sent a telegram: Don't forget that more\nthan the life of Gandhi, the life of 6 crores of the Depressed Classes is in\nyour hands.\n\n174\n\n\fcomrade Sahajanandha and made him preach that Hindu\nreligion and Hindu religious dharma must be saved and also\nhelped him to run a magazine. They caught comrade\nM.C.Rajah and made him speak about the holiness of Hindu\nreligion. Because such people were there, Dr.Ambedkar\nconsidered that it was not possible for him to destroy\nHinduism, and that it was not possible to eradicate\nuntouchability by remaining in Hinduism, he decided to quit\nHinduism.\nThe salary being given out of the Untouchability\nEradication Fund is only being used for the Brahmins. [...]\nIn any Congress meeting have they sat and taken food\nwithout being differentiated as Brahmins and nonBrahmins? Even in a recent Congress meeting, did they not\nfeed the non-Brahmins by making them sit outside? In all\nthe meetings, right from the Congress Conference, they\nhave cooked only using Brahmins, have they allowed\npeople of other castes to enter the kitchens?\nTake the Self-Respect meetings or its conferences.\nNadar, Naidu, Muslim, and those who are called\nUntouchables, all of them together cooked the meal. All of\nthem together served the food and right from the 'Saivas' to\nall the so-called 'upper' castes sat together and eat.\nAt least from this you must understand the Congress's\nconspiracy of untouchability. Even if the self-respecters\ndon't have faith, they praise some religions because they\ndon't have untouchability. They support some political\nparties because it gives equal rights for the Untouchables.\nThe Self-Respect movement tom-toms that anything that\ndenies human rights must be destroyed because that is\nhuman nature.\n[Kudiarasu, 19-1-1936]\nTraitors\nA few among you, who are Brahmins' coolies, live by\nobtaining wages from the Brahmins for saying that the\nBritish Government did not do anything for you and that the\nnon-Brahmin agitation did not do any good for you. That\n\n175\n\n\fgroup is not only amongst you, but is also amongst us. So,\nto an extent we need to give space for the life of people like\nthat.\nThe reason for getting this right is because of the\nagitation of the Self Respect Movement. The Brahmins\nmade a conspiracy of boycotting the Simon Commission\nsince they didn't want their mistakes to be known in the\nParliament in England. That did not work with the SelfRespecters.\n[Tirunchengode Adi Dravidar Conference, 7-3-1936]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nInstead of speaking about caste (because that will attract the\nwrath of Brahmins), Gandhi started saying that he will\neradicate untouchability. For 10, 15 years he got publicity.\nHe collected several lakh rupees. Till today, he could not\nsay from his mouth that castes must be destroyed. Instead of\nthat he says that it is his duty to save the caste (that is\nVarnashrama) system.\nWhat is the reason? If his Mahatma title is to become\npermanent, he has to say that he will protect the castes. He\nhas come to that state.\n[Kudiarasu, 5-4-1936]\nSelf Respect Movement\nSelf Respect Movement was started for the people to lead a\nlife of dignity and self-respect. There is nothing to laugh\nabout it. It is a social organization to make people respect\neach other. Because of this social movement we face and\nsuffer many problems.\n[Kudiarasu, 5-4-1936]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nIn 1920, Gandhi made four plans for the betterment of\nhuman society. That is: removal of untouchability, HinduMuslim unity, prohibition of liquor, and kadhar (handspun\ncotton). What happened to these four?\n\n176\n\n\fThe removal of untouchability has come to such a level\nthat unless the Untouchables come of Hinduism,\nuntouchability cannot be removed. When I said this in a\nCongress meeting in 1923, everyone detested me. When I\nsaid the same thing in 1928, 29 some people displayed\npatience, a few experienced difficulties. But today it has\nbecome one of the major problems in India.\nIf untouchability has to be eradicated, it cannot take\nplace by remaining in Hinduism; it is not possible by the\nCongress; it is not possible by Gandhi. They need to leave\nthe Hindu religion and go to another religion, that too the\nIslamic religion: this situation has been created. Keeping\naside the concept of whether this is right or wrong, no one\ncan refute that Gandhi's philosophy of untouchability\neradication has created this situation.\n[Kudiarasu, 5-4-1936]\nRound Table Conference\nWhat is our political agitation? What basis does it have\nother than 'which group should capture power?' If you want\nan example turn to the chapter on Gandhi and the Round\nTable Conference. What is there in that? The British\nGovernment called you (the Indians) to know what you\nwanted? We, who are the Indians, what did we go there and\nsay? On behalf of the Hindus, Gandhi said, \"our tradition\nmust be protected.\"\nThose who went on behalf of the non-Brahmins among\nthe Hindus, said, \"of the freedom you are going to offer, we\nneed at least as per our percentage of the population.\"\nComrade Ambedkar who went on behalf of the\nUntouchables among the Hindus said, \"You first distribute a\ncertain quantity to our society, and then you can give any\namount of freedom.\"\nWhat was the answer of Gandhi to all this?\n\"All of them are traitors to the nation, they are all\nhenchmen of the British Government; I am the only patriot.\nI am the sole leader of all the religions and all the sections\nof the Indian society. If you give the Swaraj that I demand,\n\n177\n\n\flater I shall look into the matter of these people. He not only\nsaid this but also he took a vow, \"If you give political\nrepresentation to them without my consent, I shall commit\nsuicide.\"\nThe Round Table became an eight-cornered table.\n[Kudiarasu, 14-6-1936]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nAt first only the Justice Party worked for the Muslims, poor\nand the Untouchables. Only after that Gandhi started\nworking like them.\nAfter Gandhi became a 'Mahatma,' he said that without\nHindu-Muslim unity, Swaraj could not be created.\nLikewise, he said to the Untouchables that Swaraj would\ncome only when untouchability is eradicated, and that\nwithout untouchability being eradicated, Swaraj will not\ncome and even if it comes then, it is not necessary.\nLater, when he went to the Round Table Conference he\nsaid that without Swaraj, Hindu-Muslim unity would not\ncome about. Jinnah got angry on hearing these words. He\nasked, \"We need to know what is our position in the Swaraj\nGovernment?\" because he knew that Gandhi's Ram Raj\nwould only be a Hindu rule. Gandhi cannot cheat everyone,\nright? Seeing that they did not come to any decision, the\nBritish Government delivered justice to that society.\nNext, to ruin the Untouchables state, he went on a fast.\nSo, Ambedkar got afraid and he felt \"we have committed\nmany sins and are born in the untouchable society. What\nmore sins will come to us?\"\nSo he ran to Gandhi and signed the Poona Pact.\nWhat do these people do for the removal of\nuntouchability? They give them oil and soap and peanuts\nand rice and peppermint. Is this service for the Harijans?\nThis costs one rupee a week. The person who distributes\nthis material has a salary of Rs.36 per month.\nToday, the difficulty of the poor cannot be really told.\nNobody looks after the welfare of the poor. The torture of\nthe poor people by the caste people is impossible to narrate.\n\n178\n\n\fWe observed all this and felt that we can use the\nCongress, but they saw to it that a man with integrity does\nnot come to the Congress. Anybody who is not a slave of\nthe Brahmins does not have a place there.\nBut one question: If they win in the elections, let them\nsay that they will give equal opportunity as per communal\nrepresentation in all the positions. But what is possible\nwhen they threaten that this is betrayal to the nation?\nThe way you threaten us, go and threaten (Jinnah)\nSahib, the Bengal Muslims: they will immediately break\nyour teeth and give it in your hand.\n[Kudiarasu, 18.10.1936]\nSocial Equality\nIf a riot breaks out, the upper caste people will supply the\nlower caste people with drinks and see that they become\nsacrifices. If their work is not achieved, they will be\nbetrayers who will go under the feet of the enemies. Only\nthese serve as the ancient heritage of India.\nHe, who thinks that India and the Indian people require\nbenefit, must think as an Indian and understand the Indian\nsituation and act accordingly. If he reads about foreign\ncountries and remains a bookworm, it is a wasteful effort.\nWhen the state of our society is like the state of the foreign\nsociety, to use the foreign methods will be apt. Like the\nsaying, \"A blind man gazing a King's gaze\" our Indian\nParaiyar, Chakkili, Brahmin, Sudra speaking of economic\nequality, Marxism, Leninism in our villages is just plain\nmasquerade and waste of time.\nSo the socialist youth of today please forget the idea of\nbecoming rich for some days at least and involve\nthemselves in the work of annihilating caste, creating social\nequality and social revolution. Because of unexpected\nreasons, if the situation is conducive we shall think about\neconomy also.\n[Kudiarasu, 19-11-1936]\n\n179\n\n\fUntouchables\nToday, in this annual function, comrades U.P.A.\nSoundarapandian, N. Sivaraj, S.Gurusamy, T.N.Raman,\nKunjitham,\nVidwan\nMunusamy,\nArockiasamy,\nKalyanasundaram have spoken here. You must stay united.\nYou must make a lot of women your members.\nSeveral people who spoke here, talked about Self\nRespect and politics. Since it is seen that the majority of the\nmembers of this association are from the Depressed Classes,\nit is useful for you to support the Government. In politics,\nyour group has been divided separately. Because there is a\ngreat difference between the objectives and status of your\nsection and the other sections, you need to demand separate\nrights.\nThough the Government gave you separate rights, the\nother upper caste people cheated you. The upper castes\nnaturally have slyness and cunning. That is why they remain\nas upper caste. Because you don't have that, you are joined\nin the lower castes and you enjoy the benefits of that.\nComrade Arockiasamy got angry when you were called\ndowntrodden people. What is the point of getting angry?\nObviously, are you not downtrodden? If that was not so,\nyou would not need special rights? Look at how many\nobstacles you have in social life as per the law? You do not\nhave the right of temple entry. After the Justice Party came,\nyou have been given the right to enter the streets, ponds,\nand schools. Even now, in several places there is a ban on\nthat.\nIf one has to speak justly, you alone are not\ndowntrodden. Those who do not have temple entry rights in\nsome places are not the only downtrodden. Even we who\nhave rights to enter all the temples are also downtrodden.\nEven in the temples, there are several places where even we\nare not allowed. In hotels, we are also segregated and not\nallowed entry into some rooms.\nOur sympathy is because we feel that if your disgrace is\nremoved, our disgrace might also be removed. Do you not\nknow of the practice of calling the server, under the pretext\nthat your neighbour needs a food-item, and once he comes,\n\n180\n\n\fyou also get an extra helping from the server? That is how,\nif your problems and humiliation is removed, even our\nproblems and humiliation will be automatically removed.\nThat is why we keep talking about your grievances all the\ntime.\nHow much you hate politics, how much you remain\nwithout joining political parties, that much your grievances\ncan be solved: that is my opinion. If you do not give place\nto those who trample your heads, your difficulties will soon\nbe taken care of. Otherwise, you will have to remain as a\nstepping-stone.\nThough it is fifty years since the formation of the\nCongress, only after the Justice Party took part and began to\nask for a share, in the social sector a great change could\ncome about. Only after that, even in your state there have\nbeen many changes in these ten years. If this was not so,\nand you had to be behind the Congress, and if you had been\nbehind the upper-caste and flattering them, think of what\nyour position could be.\nThink of how the Travancore temple's door was broken.\nThe people there, including the Depressed Classes,\nEzhavars, Nadars and others tried to break the religion and\ntemple and god. Tens of thousands of people conducted\nconferences and resolved that Hindu religion is a sham, the\ntemple is a sham, and that god is a sham.\nSeveral people became Muslims and put on the Turkish\ncap. Several people grew their hair, their beards, got\nthemselves a kirpan (knife) and became Sikhs. Some people\nconverted into Christianity along with their family. Only\nafter that the door of the temple was opened. All the upper\ncastes in Tamil Nadu including the Brahmins congratulated\nthe Travancore Maharajah. See where the secret of success\nlies. Likewise if you start demolishing Congress, religion,\ntemples, and god you will automatically get all the rights\nwithout anyone's grace.\nWithout being so, nothing will happen because of your\ngetting angry over being called downtrodden. The title of\nParaiyars changed into Adi Dravidars, which changed into\n\n181\n\n\fHarijans, which might change into some other name, but\nyour problems and humiliation will not be removed.\nLike the wood of an axe (which brings ruin to its own\nkindred), if a few are supportive of the Brahmins we must\nnot be cheated. Because there are several such low,\nshameless people among ourselves we need to suffer by\nkeeping such associations and establishments. If everyone\nhas the feeling of self-respect, why should there be an\nassociation of the Depressed Classes or non-Brahmins?\nSeveral among us are those who live by kissing the feet\nthat kicks them. For the disgraceful occupation of such\npeople, we need a remedy. That lies only in our noncooperation and being obstacles.\nPlease remember that the Justice Party is a party of\nequality. Only after it was started, today the Paraiyan and\nthe Brahmin are sitting equally in the same place. It is the\nspeech of olden days to say that equality means that the\ntiger and the cow must drink water from the same place. But\nthat is taking place today in the circus.\nBecause of that we don't say that it is a government of\nequality. But today the Paraiyan, Brahmin, Sastri,\nSankaracharya and the Chakkili are all sitting in the same\ndais-How? Because of the whip? Or because of the fear of\nrevolver? No, not at all. They themselves desire so, they\nspend ten thousand, and twenty thousand and wish to be\nseated so. The Brahmin remains standing and speaks to the\nParaiyan saying O Lord, O Master. How was all this\ncreated? Before the creating of the Justice Party, in the\nCongress meetings, actions, policies, schemes was there one\nsingle word about the Depressed Classes: think and see? So\nI ask you, do you still have doubts whether the Justice Party\nis a party of equal justice? So, even now, even today, I only\ndo the work of social equality.\nEven I like to do the work of economic equality. Not\nonly is the Congress a dead enemy of that, but it is also an\nestablishment of treachery. Only if it is abolished it shall be\ncomfortable to talk of economic equality. Still, without\nbeing against the law that is without becoming a victim of\n\n182\n\n\foppression by the Government, I am campaigning as much\nas possible for equality. I am going to continue doing so.\n[Kudiarasu, 10-01-1937]\nTemple Entry\nIn the time of Manu, or in the time of Raman, Krishnan,\nHarishchandran, Pandiyan, Naickar, could a 'Paraiyar'\nbecome a political minister? Or let it be any God. Even if\nthe Paraiyan and Pulayan are going to come in front and\npull out their tongue and die, in the Kerala country-that\nhas tradition and Varnashrama madness like a monkey's\ngrip, where the men and women think that they shall get a\nhigher position if they are born to the Brahmin, where the\npeople and the politics consider that it is a sin if they are\nseen by the Paraiyan, and if his shadow touches them, or if\nhis words fall on their ears-could anybody have expected\nthat it would have been possible for the Paraiyans to enter\ntemples? This work has taken place only in our time.\n[Kudiarasu, 18-7-1937]\nCaste and Education\nThe Brahmin community in India is 100% literate. But why\nare 90% of other castes illiterate? 95% of the non-Brahmins\nare illiterates and 991\u20442% of the Depressed Classes are\nilliterates. Is the government a cause for all these? What\nhave we done to find the cause? Does the government give\nus education? Or does the government not have money to\ndo it? Are people not interested in education? If we analyze\nthese questions we can arrive at the conclusion as to why\n90% of us remain uneducated! (The main reason for this is\nthat good education is denied to these people, under the\ngarb of caste).\nIf you look at the true cunningness in this-we can\nderive the following: it is mentioned in the law-giving\nVedas and Sastras on which community alone should be\ngiven education. There were laws on who should teach and\nalso who should be taught. So one can see that the true\nreason for the majority remaining uneducated is the Vedas.\n\n183\n\n\fThe worst affected by these Sastras and Vedas are the\nUntouchables. They are making several plans to see that\nUntouchables remain uneducated. There is no school for\nthem in several places. Even if there are some schools that\ngive them education, the Untouchables cannot use public\nroads to reach the school since they should not use these\nroads.\nEven if they try to get educated, they do not have the\nmeans or money to get education. They do not get enough\nfood. To solve all these problems it has become basic to\nabolish the religion that alone stands as the stumbling block\nfor development. Protecting the religion and saying that\neveryone should get education is an ignorance and\nhypocrisy. So we should abolish the rules given in the\nreligion at first. To do so, we need courage, only when we\nhave that courage we can achieve freedom and education.\n[Kudiarasu, 22-8-1937]\nBrahmins and Untouchability\nWill the Brahmins be ready to give up any of the rights\nenjoyed by them? Likewise, will the Muslims be ready to\ndivide any of the rights enjoyed by them? Will the\nBrahmins and the 'high' caste people agree to wipe off the\ndisgrace and the cruelties suffered by the non-Brahmins and\nthe Depressed Classes?\n[Pagutharivu, 19-9-1937]\nHinduism and Caste System\nThe only reason for several divisions among the Indians is\nour religion. What is the reason for several castes: that too\nhigh-low, Brahmin-Paraiyar? Is not our religion the only\ncause for all this? Sastri, B.A., B.L., said that the low caste\npersons could touch the high caste persons only after death.\nIt is impossible in this birth. The only basis is the Sastras\nand Vedas of the Hinduism. For, only Hindu religion gives\nthe Brahmins all comforts, social status, money, freedom\netc., so such a religion must be destroyed because it\ndiscriminates others as Untouchables. There is no difference\n\n184\n\n\fin caste among animals as untouchable dog, Brahmin dog\netc.\n[Kudiarasu, 19-12-1937]\nUntouchability eradication\nEven now research is going on into knowing the caste of the\nchild who will be born when a woman of one caste and a\nman of another caste unite. If someone like us says, \"Why\nsir! People of other countries have progressed so much, why\nwe are still indulging in this research? Is it correct?\" They\nimmediately get angry and say, \"What do you know? How\nmuch have you studied? You come and advice us! The\nresearch of foreign countries has only two day's life.\"\nFrom this, think of the progress of our country and the\nprogress of other countries. In general, don't you agree that\nin our country, only seven out of hundred people have been\neducated? Secondly, don't you agree that our people don't\nhave the means to eat, don't get a job or the wages, in tens\nof thousands they board the ships with their children and\ntheir pregnant women and go to lands that they haven't seen\nbefore or even heard of before and die there? Don't you\naccept that man considers another as low and shameful and\ncastes are divided into upper and lower and are called\nPanchamas and Mlechas and Sudras, and in daily life they\nare belittled and cruelly treated in a manner that degrades\ntheir self-respect?\nIf that is so, you think and see whether is it possible for\nour country to progress by maintaining this state? If we\nthink of the cruelty, irrationality and foolishness of\nuntouchability, our mind does not give even a little place for\nus to forgive that or to be indifferent, or to say that 'it can\nbe looked into tomorrow,' 'what is the need or urgency for\nit now,' or to postpone it.\n[Pagutharivu, 1938, Issue 10, No 3]\nUntouchability eradication\nThough several cruelties that do not exist anywhere in the\nworld and are unacceptable to humanity, justice and\n\n185\n\n\frationalism exist in the Indian nation-among them the\nissue that needs to be solved urgently, and in order to be\nrespected by the peoples of the world is untouchability. To\nprove that Indians are not barbarians but are a humane and\nbelong to a civilized society-and if they need to say that\nthey are capable of protecting their own nation and\nestablishing rule and governance like the majority of the\npeoples of the countries of the world - we can firmly state\nthat there are two tasks that need to be completed at first.\nAmong these, the first task is to abolish the practice of\nconsidering, as untouchable at birth, many groups with a\npopulation of several crores in the Indian soil. Secondly to\nabolish or refrain from giving them a treatment that is more\ndreadful than what is given to the animals that lack the\nsense of reason, and lower than given to the worms and\ninsects that lack the sense of feeling.\n[Pagutharivu 1938]\nHorror of Untouchability\nIf we think of the horror and absurdity and brutality in the\nconcept of untouchability, our mind does not allow us even\na little to forgive it, or disregard it, or casually postpone it\nby saying, \"what is the necessity or urgency, this can be\ndealt with later.\" Sometimes we feel that if one wants to\nmake those people who consider others as untouchable and\nmete out cruelties, to realize the true difficulties of the\nUntouchables, the horrors experienced under the present\nBritish rule are not enough and we need a tyranny with a\ncontinuous military rule that is devoid of any little freedom\nor equality. Only then these people will become sensitive\nand achieve realization.\nBut because India is in the tight grasp of not only such\nbrutality and lack of legitimacy, but also of stupidity, so no\nmatter how much humiliation and cruelties take place it will\nbe difficult to bring about a situation where such people\nrealize the real sorrow. Yet, there is place for the belief that\nthis state of affairs will change.\n[Pagutharivu, 1938]\n\n186\n\n\fCongress and Untouchability\nThe Public Works Department Minister Honourable Yakub\nHassan inaugurated the South Tanjore Zilla Congress\nConference. In that conference, three Adi Dravidas were\ninsulted for the sin of having taken part in a community\ninter-dining (samabandhi bhojan) and it has created a great\nflutter in south India. With the exception of the Congress\npapers, all the other newspapers carried condemnation\nstatements. But the Congressmen who have girded up their\nloins to emancipate the 'Harijans' are maintaining a silence.\nNo Congress paper has till now condemned this atrocity and\nwritten against it.\nIn the name of the Congress, the 'Harijan' members of\nthe Chennai Assembly, or the 'Harijan' minister have not\nopened their mouth till now. It is being advertised that the\n'Harijan' Minister Honourable Munusamy Pillai and the\n'Harijan' Mayor comrade J.Sivashanmugam Pillai, are\ndoing community dining with caste-Hindus. But the right of\n'community dining'-is it only for the 'Harijan' minister\nand Mayor, is it not for the Harijan society? Is it just and\nfair when they accept the respect for themselves, a respect\nthat their society does not have? Is it their opinion that\nwhatever the status of their society, it is enough if they get\nposition and money? Are they not shown the respect of\ncommunity dining only because the 'Harijan' ministers and\n'Harijan' mayors will clap hands for the Brahmins' farce\nand remain as henchmen?\nWhen the injustice at the South Tanjore Congress\nConference has caused mental turmoil to the entire Adi\nDravidar community, it is not proper that the Honourable\nMunusamy Pillai and Mayor Sivashanmugam Pillai remain\nsilent. If they are unable to search for a remedy for this\nhumiliation, it is just and fair that they resign their\npositions. What are Honourable Munusamy Pillai and\nMayor Sivashanmugam Pillai going to do?\n[Kudiarasu, 16-1-1938]\n\n187\n\n\fBrahmins and caste arrogance\nPeople other than Sudras and Untouchables will not know\nabout the importance and greatness of this social movement.\nIn the olden days, the income tax collectors who were\njust paid Rs.10 to Rs.15 as monthly pay, who were\ninvariably Brahmins used to address the income tax payer\n(naturally they should be very rich in comparison with the\ntax collectors) in singular respectless terms and also these\nrich men used to stand up with folded hands. Thus in these\nways the arrogant Brahmins held respect. But now because\nof the Self Respect movement we can see the difference.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-3-1938]\nHinduism and caste\nIn this country, there is only one caste that is not called\nuntouchable \u2013 that is the Brahmin caste. Other than that\npeople of all other castes are only considered to be\nUntouchables.\nEuropeans, Muslims, Indian Christians and those nonBrahmins who are called Hindus are only Untouchables to\nthe Brahmins.\nThis is not being merely uttered from the mouth; we are\nmade inferior by their saying that this is according to\nreligious doctrines and Veda Sastra rules. If someone is said\nto be a Hindu, he will have a caste and he has to accept that.\nStill, not only the Hindu religion, but the Hindu Gods are\nalso included in caste discrimination.\nSo, as long as a man wants to be in the Hindu crowd, he\nwill come under caste discrimination, and as long as he is a\nnon-Brahmin, he has to remain a lower caste. How many\never Gandhis arise, how much ever they are advertised as\nMahatmas, caste discrimination and 'upper'-'lower' castes\nwill not be annihilated any day. For this, till now several\npeople have taken so much effort. Everyone who has tried\nso has been made into a slave of the Brahmins, and he who\ndid not become a slave has been destroyed, they have not\nallowed anyone to rear his head.\n[Kudiarasu, 13-3-1938]\n\n188\n\n\fPractices of Untouchability\nFor eating together with the upper castes, a man is tied up,\nbeaten, his head is shaved, and mud and cow dung are\nmixed with water and poured on his head. Power is also\nonly in the hands of high caste and it does not reach the low\ncastes. Even today, the two-tumbler system is followed in\nhotels.\n[Kudiarasu, 3-7-1938]\nSelf-Respect Movement\nWhat has ripened the people's resolve to such an extent that\nthey consider the throwing open of the Travancore temple,\nchanging the gruesome state where once the Untouchables\ncould not walk in the streets of that samasthanam (princely\nstate), and yesterday, the Adi-Dravidars entering the\nMadurai Azhagar temple as very casual events?\nAny ritual is not possible without the Brahmins, there is\nrespect and honour only if the Brahmins come: such a state\nhas changed. And today people think it is a shame to call\nthe Brahmins for rituals because it is damaging to our selfrespect. What brought about this change? Is this all? Who\nmade the people who were Depressed Classes and\nconsidered disgraceful as a Mayor and Minister and gave\nthem importance? Only the Self-Respect Movement started\nall this and countless such revolutionary activities in this\ncountry. Can anyone deny this? If anyone denies it, I pray\nthat they may look at the propaganda we have been doing\nfor the past 15 years and the resolutions we adopted in our\nconferences and attain clarity.\nWhen we were indulging in so much of uproar, we did\nnot have the necessary monetary strength, government\nsupport, or the help of intellectuals, the educated, the rich,\nthe landowners, or the important people. All these work, we\nstood alone, without capturing politics, we were victims of\noppression, and we accepted great difficulties. Today if all\nthe Tamils, pundits, intellectuals, important people, rich,\npolitical leaders, several Tamils who are said to be\n\n189\n\n\fprotectors of religions are today going to be united, we can\nachieve more success than what we have so far achieved.\nIf we have unity, the capacity of living together without\njealousy, discipline, selflessness, and no thirst for power,\nnot only will we achieve success, it is certain that we will\nalso become the guide for a great revolution in India.\n[Kudiarasu, 16-07-1939]\nJustice Party\nThey preach that the Justice Party is an anti-Hindu\nmovement. We should not even demonstrate. If we\ndemonstrate, they say that it is legally wrong and they say\nwe should be hanged! Intellectuals say that the prevailing\nlaws are tyrannical.\n[Viduthalai, 2-8-1938]\nCongress and Untouchability\nI have often warned about Congress and Gandhi not\nbecause the British should leave India or not. We should\nhave political power because the people who came here to\nmake their living have practiced all types of cruelties\nagainst the natives and have succeeded in it. They have\nenslaved the natives and have overpowered them. Of the\nthree (Aryans, Muslims and British) who ruled us, the\nAryans were the cruelest to us. They have not only enslaved\nus but also made us barbarians by their religion and\npolitically ruined us. Even if the British rule over us for\n1000 years more or if the Muslims rule us for over 16,000\nyears still we do not want the Aryan rule, that is why the\nCongress and Gandhi who happen to be instrument and\ncoolies of the Aryans must be totally abandoned from the\nroot.\n[Kudiarasu, 7-8-1938]\nVarnashrama Dharma\nGandhi asks the non-Brahmins to work without even\nthinking of saving a small silver coin, and follow their\n\n190\n\n\fhereditary occupation on the basis of Varnashrama dharma.\nSo he established the Vardha scheme. Based on this they\nbanned alcohol and closed all the schools by stating that\nthere was no revenue to run schools since there was no\nrevenue due to prohibition (ban of liquor sales).\n[Kudiarasu, 7-8-1938]\nLinguistic identity\nIf a Tamilian considers himself to be of an unmixed/ pure\nTamil race he should first come out of the religion which\nhas no relation with him and which calls him as Sudra and\nChandala. To be more precise, the low status of a Tamilian\nis because of the fact that he considers the Hindu religion as\nhis religion and India as his nation and that labouring for\nother people and nation is the true service to nation. Indian\nPatriotism in Tamilian means serving people of other states\nand being a slave to people of other states.\n[Kudiarasu, 28-10-1938]\nCasteism and Racism\nThere is a proverb in the Bible:\"First remove the beam from\nyour own eye and then you can see clearly to remove the\nspeck of chaff that is in your brother's eye. (Luke 6:42)\"\nThis proverb comes to our mind while the Congressmen\nspeak of South Africa.\nWe ask why do they shed crocodile tears over what\nhappens in distant South Africa while they do not worry\nabout the people who are born in this country and are\nsegregated, harassed and disgraced.\nIf the people of our country have to be treated with\nrespect by people of other countries, the practice of\ndegrading, oppressing and humiliating the people of our\nown country must be annihilated. We must gain the right to\nlive with self-respect. Only when we destroy this, if we ask\nsomething to the foreigners they will give it weightage, only\nthen we can have the right to ask.\n[Kudiarasu, 04-02-1940]\n\n191\n\n\fWorking castes\nIt is our opinion that the farm labourer, the viswakarma\n(carpenter), the weaver, the leather-worker are all the same.\nNot only have they been differentiated by virtue of caste,\nbut they are also the necessary base and vital for the human\nsociety. They function in the same manner. Why should\nthere be difference between them? Apart from the\ndifference as per the religion and Sastras, what is the\nevident difference?\nSo, the emancipation of labourers shall lie in\nannihilation of caste differences that create the hierarchy of\nlabour, and the hierarchy of labourers.\nFirst, there should be no caste difference between the\nproletariats. There should be no higher or lower labour.\nEveryone should unite. The religious Sastras that teach\ndifference and degradation must be destroyed. Politics must\nbe captured. Those who are called the higher castes and\nthose who live lazily without doing physical labour must be\nconsidered as enemies and those concepts must be utterly\ndestroyed. Every labourer class should think that the world\nexists because of them. Only because of them people are\nable to live. They must realize that they are the foundation\nfor the shared human existence.\nBecause the working class people didn't realize it and\nthey became henchmen of the Brahmins who love to lead a\nlazy life, even till today the labourers, or the labour methods\nhave not attained any development. The non-Brahmin party\nthat is the Justice Party, even when it got a little political\ndominance it carried out several efforts to abolish this caste\ndifference. The people who were Backward and Depressed\nclasses on account of their labour largely attained the\nbenefits. Whoever the labourers are, whether it is caste-wise\nlabor, or coolie labour, everyone who toils with their body\nare only non-Brahmins.\nRich men or upper caste or those who gained\nsupremacy through the Laws of Manu, are not the\nauthorities in the Justice Party. As far as possible, the\n\n192\n\n\fJustice Party keeps the upper caste and the rich people\nwithout influence in the party.\nIf the labourers, the poor people, the lay people who\nform ninety percentage of the non-Brahmins fail to use this\ngood opportunity and try to improve their status, it will\nmean that the Tamilians are only fit for being Sudras and\nUntouchables under the rule of Manu Dharma and that the\ntime for a solution to their suffering and disgrace has not yet\ncome.\nTamils! Intellectuals! Brave men! We fold our hands\nand welcome you to come and join this organization of the\nTamils!\n[Viduthalai, 16-2-1940]\nAryans and Dravidians\nIn this age, even today there are streets with hotels, idli\nshops, water pandals, gods, temples where Aryans and\nDravidians are given different places. Dravidians should not\nenter the places where Aryans enter because if a Dravidian\nenters the place or area it becomes contaminated. So the\nDravidians were punished. On seeing this, should not men\nwith self-respect and human dignity think of self-respect\nand freedom than thinking of national politics? In the nation\nthat was ruled by us, in which we lived, the cunning,\ndeceitful, dishonest Aryans who came for their living call\nthemselves as upper caste, and are well treated, whereas we\nare ill treated in our own country as low people. Till this\nstigma is removed do we need positions, posts or degrees?\nNow it is our primary duty to tell our people about the\nsocial and religious discrimination between Aryans and\nDravidians. For this we need a separate campaign, a\nseparate establishment and a separate army. It will not\nbecome a crime if we realize our situation and if we\nstruggle to remove our disgrace.\nAfter the war is over, this should be our work. For this\nitself, we say, \"The Dravidar Nadu is for the Dravidians.\" If\nthe government fails to partition the country and create us a\nseparate politics, we should be ready to die in that struggle.\n\n193\n\n\fIt will only be a tyranny, no matter how the rule is, if\nsomeone comes to another person's land and dominates and\nmakes the people of that land as Sudras and low castes.\nToday, we do not have the name of Dravidians. We do\nnot have the name of Tamils. We only have the names of\nSudras, Untouchables, fourth caste, fifth caste etc. Is this\nright? Do you agree with this? Should this not be changed?\nMust we not work for it? If we are to consider it a shame\nthat the British did not call our party's president, then how\ngreat a shame it is that the 3.5 crore people of our society\nare called Sudras, low caste, untouchable and kept apart by\na begging group (Brahmins)? Is the Minister's post, the post\nof member of the Viceroy's Council, the post of Advisor,\nGovernor etc. more important or more urgent or necessary?\nLet the state of the old people, the shameless money\ncrazy, power-crazy be anyway. You, who are the youth,\ncome forward with firmness, courage and resolve. In ten\nyears we can carry out a great social revolution and attain\nhonour and liberation.\n[Kudiarasu, 28-7-1940]\nCongress and Casteism\nIn this century, even in this 20th century, we carry the title of\nbeing a disgraceful caste. Temples, tanks, hotels and such\nplaces, separate place is allotted for Brahmins and for the\nSudras-so we are made into Sudras. This should be\nchanged. We need to struggle for this. Non-Brahmin people\nin Congress, without even a little shame, join the chorus of\nthe Brahmins and shout, \"Annihilate Imperialism.\"\nCongress non-Brahmins who do not have the capacity or\nshame to abolish advertisement boards displaying Brahmins\nwith durba grass and showing us as lower caste, are they\ngoing to abolish imperialism?\nThat\ntoo,\nwhen\ncomrades\nRajagopalachari,\nSatyamoorthy and Jawaharlal worship the temple of\nimperialism and circumambulate it from left and right, what\na farce it is when these Congress non-Brahmins say that\nimperialism should be annihilated. If they have even a little\n\n194\n\n\fshame, let them burn the durba grass, let them pull the\nadvertisement boards and fling it off. Instead of doing so,\ndon't they not shamelessly ingratiate with the Brahmins?\nMoreover, Comrade Lingam who spoke about the\nmunicipality elections that are to take place this month in\nErode asked whether the Municipality would not leave way.\nWe do not require that. I am willing to leave and give way.\nLet any Congress leader get up and say, let them accept that\nat least as far as this place is concerned in the coffee shops\nand Brahmin hotels, the boards that say 'Brahmins - NonBrahmins' will be removed and flung off. Tomorrow itself I\nshall ask our party nominee to withdraw and today I shall\nmake the ten Justice Party councilors in the Municipal\nCouncil to submit their resignation.\nInstead of that, in the manner of saying, \"Your property\nis mine. My property is also mine,\" they feel that we should\nnot bother about our being a low caste. We should also\naccept that they are higher caste. If this is said to be\nfreedom should we keep nodding like temple-cows. For me,\nsomehow, as I think over this again and again it gives me\nanger. So, it is our duty that we need to win over any\ndifficulty and sacrifice our all.\n[Kudiarasu, 11-8-1940]\nAdi Dravidars\nIn our country along with the difference between the\nDravidian people as Dravidar and Adi Dravidar, the Adi\nDravidar society has continued to be a very large number.\nIn the Dravidian nation, how are the Dravidians\nuntouchable for the Aryans who came from outside? This\nsituation is a very shameful situation for the Dravidian\nsociety and it protects the Aryans by dividing and treating\nthe Dravidians as untouchable people.\nSo, the name Adi Dravidar itself must be changed. Both\nmust be called Dravidians or Tamilians. All social\ndifferences and discrimination between Dravidians and Adi\nDravidars must be eradicated. It is my desire that they must\nbecome one. In both these cases, in my opinion this is the\n\n195\n\n\fobjective of the Justice Party, so I say these in the name of\nthat party. It must be made a special duty of our party to\nensure that in matters like employment and education for\nthe Adi Dravidars special privileges must be shown so that\nthey attain equality with us.\n[Kudiarasu, 25-8-1940]\nSocial Reform\nWe have so far not got any social reforms through political\nreforms. Any small social justice we have obtained means it\nis only through the demonstration and never by law.\n[Kudiarasu, 25-8-1940]\nBrahmin domination in employment\nThe statistics collected by the government in the year 1939\nabout the pay and the number of posts held by Brahmins\nand non-Brahmins, is given by the following table:\n\nS.\nNo.\n1.\n\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nPay\nGazetted officers and\nadministrative officers\npay from Rs.300/- to\nRs.5000\nPosts in the pay scale\ngreater than 100\nPay above Rs.35 like\nGumasta\nPay less than Rs.35\npeon, coolies\n(running errands)\n\nNo. of\nBrahmins\n\nNo. of NonBrahmins\n\n609\n\n398\n\n3667\n\n2492\n\n9183\n\n8042\n\n1513\n\n33662\n\nSo from the statistics it is evident that the Brahmins who are\njust 3% of the population occupy more number of the better\npositions i.e., 3% holding 609 posts and 97% holding only\n398 posts. When it comes to coolies etc. the 3% represent\n\n196\n\n\f1513 posts whereas 97% hold 33662 posts. Even in these\nconditions we (non-Brahmins) are portrayed as hunters for\njobs and they are described as nationalists and martyrs of\nthe nation who renounce everything for the sake of nation.\n[Kudiarasu, 25-8-1940]\nCommon dining: Brahmins and Non-Brahmins\nIn the village of Thiruvaiyaru in the Tanjore district, there is\na Sanskrit College, which functions by taking grants from\nthe Tanjore King. That college which is under the control of\nthe Tanjore Zilla Board taught only Sanskrit. When the late\nDravidar Mani Sir Paneerselvam was the President of the\nTanjore Zilla Board, he ordered that Tamil should also be\ntaught there. The agragaram (Brahmin settlement) fumed,\nbut he did not get afraid.\nOn December 2, Tanjore Zilla Board President\nComrade Nadimuthu Pillai passed a resolution in the Zilla\nBoard meeting that there should be no caste difference in\nthe college hostel and that both the Brahmins and the nonBrahmins must eat together. That resolution comes into\neffect from 27 January.\nIn this hostel, there are 70 non-Brahmin students and 45\nBrahmin students.\nAfter this common dining resolution came into effect,\nthese 45 Brahmin students refused to eat in the hostel in\norder to condemn the resolution of the Zilla Board. They\nwent to the agraharam and ate. The agraharam is agitated\nand roaring seeing this resolution, which says that Brahmins\nand non-Brahmins must eat together.\nWhat is the idea? It means that even today, Brahmins\nare higher caste than the Tamils and that they are a separate\ncaste. It only shows this arrogant opinion. It only shows\ntheir varnashrama mindset that if they sit together and eat\nwith the non-Brahmins, they will get polluted, and they will\ncome to harm. If they are together with the non-Brahmins\nand they eat, will the food turn into poison? Will their\nintestines blacken? What will be harmed?\n\n197\n\n\fWhat lesson are you going to teach for the Brahmin\narrogance that refuses to eat with the Tamils? Does your\nshame not arise! Do you not feel ashamed and sad? When\nwould the Brahmin caste--that refuses to accept that you are\nalso men--stop it's bragging? When will you attain selfrespect? Think and see. Resolve.\n[Viduthalai, 29-01-1941]\nPress\nWhile speaking at the meeting in Ranade Hall, Mahaganam\nSastri said,\n\"A great danger has come to the country now.\nSomehow I am feeling greatly afraid, I am feeling greatly\nworried. I feel that those who need to save me have\nbetrayed me.\"\nThis has been published in the Swadeshamitran dated\n27, page 4, 3rd column. But Sastri has not explained in his\nspeech of what danger has come about that has caused him\nto worry.\nToday the truth is that the British are in danger, in\nworry and in major loss: we can consider that itself as the\ndanger that has come upon us. But Sastri or the people of\nhis caste do not understand what danger there is. In railway\nhotels, discrimination and differences have been removed.\nThe agitation from now onwards that such differences must\nbe removed has become stronger. This is a danger for Sastri\nand his caste.\nThe agitation \"Dravidar Nadu is for the Dravidians\" has\nbeen gaining strength. Of the Indian party leaders, two of\nthem that is Dr. Jinnah and Dr. Ambedkar have supported\nthis. This is the second danger. Apart from these two, it is\nnot understood what dangers the Brahmins have. To escape\nfrom this danger, Sastri charts the course: Those in jail\ninstead of worrying about Gandhi will from now onwards\nnot do Satyagraha, they will give an oath to the government,\ncome out and accept ministerial positions and govern.\"\nSo Mahaganam Sastri and other Brahmins, consider it\nas a danger because Brahmin domination will not be there.\n\n198\n\n\fNothing else. But we the Tamilians should ensure that the\nBrahmin domination must not continue. This is the\nimportant work that has to be carried out and we should be\nprepared to pay any price for the same.\nIf they think 4 Brahmins can assemble in a small room\ncalled the Ranade Hall, give information to the newspapers\non what they spoke and send items, 4 columns, 5 columns,\n7 columns will be published. They can boss over the people\nin the name of Swaraj and the nationalism.\nIn the Ranade Hall meeting, there were 4 Brahmins.\nSastri\npresided\nover\nthe\nmeeting;\ncomrade\nT.T.Krishnamachari was the speaker. One comrade Natesa\nIyer delivered the welcome address. Another comrade\nK.S.Ramasamy Sastri was the audience. In the newspapers\nthis came as a seven-column news item. They think that\n'Indian' means only the four of them. They think that their\nstatements are the Vedas. Our question is will this falsehood\ngo on even now?\n[Viduthalai, 01-05-1941]\nPress\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Tamilian is considered as the fourth and\nfifth caste; he is considered as the fifth caste; he is\nconsidered untouchable, unapproachable; and unseeable and\nis disgraced. If we have to say it in brief, a man is not\nconsidered as a man, he is considered lower than a dog, a\npig and even shit.\nWhatever a man has or not, if he has the feeling of\nshame it is enough. A man with shame will not like a life of\nslavery, he will not accept another person humiliating him,\nhe will not bear someone sitting on his head and not letting\nhim get up. That is why we say that self-respect is the life of\nthe Tamilian.\nThink a little of how the Tamilian's shame is today. In\nthe coffee clubs he is segregated as a low caste. In the\ntemples he is made to stand behind the upper castes,\nbecause he is considered lower caste. The same way in the\nhostels that are being run for students, in the halls that have\n\n199\n\n\fbeen built for charity, in the dinners being held by Brahmins\nespousing nationalism, Tamilian is considered as a low\ncaste and he is segregated.\nEven if we do not want to fight with them, they will not\nleave us. They will start a fight on their own accord. We are\nnot cowards who will give up the fight.\nIn short, for our struggle, we have a few supporters and\nseveral enemies. In this situation a newspaper is a powerful\nweapon for our fight; the daily paper is only Viduthalai.\nOur struggle for social rights is our revolution. We have\nnot resolved to carry out this revolution by bearing arms or\nby the cowardliness called Ahimsa. Through creating\nemotion among the Tamilians, through showing the present\ndisgraceful state of the Tamils, we want to unite them. We\nwant to unite them and remove their social humiliation\nthrough a revolution. Only to create the emotion of\nrevolution, our Viduthalai will work tirelessly. From today,\nViduthalai is being published from Chennai. All our\ncomrades should support it.\n[Viduthalai, 01-05-1941]\nCaste-Annihilation\nHe who does not strive to annihilate the caste system is not\na Tamilian. One has to say that there is no Tamil blood in\nhis body.\nThe superstitions of the Tamils must be eradicated.\nThere is no limit to the superstitions of the Tamils. The\nTamilian buys ticket for moksha (salvation) from the\nBrahmin. The Tamilian marries his god and lets the god\nsleep. The Tamilian takes the god to the home of prostitutes\nand keeps. For the sake of moksha, the Tamilian mixes\nurine and cow-dung and drinks it. He squanders away his\nearned wealth for all this. The Tamilian considers himself as\na low caste. Must all this not go? Only for this the Tamilian\nmovement, the Self-respect movement, the Justice\nmovement are there. Only their efforts have caused such\nreform marriages and agitations for the removal of social\ndisgrace.\n\n200\n\n\fThe British don't consider us as a low-caste by birth.\nThey don't obstruct giving social rights to us. But they\nallow the Aryans to dominate and exploit us. The British\ncan look into and remove our social disgrace through laws,\nbut we are not united enough to compel the British. Only\nbecause of their unity, the Aryans are treating us so badly.\nThey threaten the government also. Not only that. A lot of\nTamils are slaves of Aryans, coolies, in religion, society and\npolitics and they betray us to the Aryans. If this situation\ncomes to an end, and all the Tamils unite, within the blink\nof an eye, our lowness can be removed.\nThough we took several efforts because nothing could\nbe achieved, we are today agitating that \"Tamil Nadu is for\nTamils alone.\"\n[Viduthalai, 10-05-1941]\nCurrent Affairs\nComrades! I do not understand what to speak under the title\nof \"Current Affairs\"-one can speak about anything\nbecause of the title.\nThe war is going on. The Congressmen are acting out\nthe drama of Satyagraha. Jinnah is demanding Pakistan. We\nare asking for Dravidar Nadu. The Hindu Mahasabha\npeople are causing Hindu-Muslim riots. The Congressmen\nsay that somehow the prohibition (on liquor) must go. We\nsay that we need Muslim-Dravidian unity.\nThe government is collecting troops and money for the\nwar.\nJinnah and we say that we should work together with\nAdi-Dravidars. Srinivasa Sastri and Sivasamy Iyer say that\nfor a Brahmin and non-Brahmin to sit together and eat is\nagainst the law.\nThe Aryans went to court and quashed the order that the\nAryans and Tamilians can pray together at the\nTiruvannamalai temple.\nThe affluent, major landowners, and zamindars among\nour Tamil people do not have any feeling of shame. They\nflirt with our enemies. They even dare to complain to the\n\n201\n\n\fgovernment and to betray us. Our Governor is a good man,\nhe will do justice, but it looks like they will spoil him. I\ndon't go and see him unless he calls me. We need to join\nwith the Muslims and Adi Dravidars and not bother about\nanybody else and do major agitations.\nWe should consider the partitioning of our country as\nour Swaraj and complete independence.\nThe leadership position, handicrafts, business, industry,\nand comfortable jobs have gone to our enemies. We are\nheadless corpses. We will see that the support of Jinnah at\nthis juncture is a victory.\nThe Act for the removal of social humilation introduced\nby Comrade M. C. Rajah which was passed unanimously\nhas been useless. The temple entry act of Comrade\nRajagopalachari is also going to become likewise. So, all of\nyou should support our agitation for the removal of social\nills. Even if the need arises for us to go to jail in thousands,\nwe must bravely stand at the forefront. Now, going to jail is\nthe real and intense agitation for the government and for the\nlay people. Those who are afraid of that are equivalent to\ncorpses. So be ready to go to jail.\n[Viduthalai, 15-05-1941]\nSocial Reform\nI do not have faith in reform. The little faith that I had has\ngone away. I believe only in revolution. Something must be\ndone, only after that I should die. Death is close at hand. I\nhave laboured not just a little. Only I know that. I am alone\ncapable of respecting it. Only with me there is good\nstrength. So, only I have the credentials to tell a decision\nabout myself. Not those who are passive onlookers who\nattain good if it comes and shrug off any connection if evils\ncome. Those who criticize and advice me, let them pay a\nlittle attention to their status and rights.\nOnly the worry that I have to soon do something that\nstrikes me as the right thing to do, makes me decide some\npath and I do not have any ill-will towards anybody. How\ncan one think that any work can be done with the people\nwho feel worried and complain about the hatred towards\n\n202\n\n\fPeriya Puranam and Ramayana? In the year 1922 itself, I\nsaid that these ought to be burnt. In 1928, in several\npresidencies outside and in our state, it has been burnt. In\n1935 it has been burnt by the Adi Dravidars. Those who are\nprotesting now are only the Aryan slaves. In this situation,\nthey need to quit, or I must leave them and quit.\nWhy do I need a relationship that is devoid of goodwill\nand honesty? I need to tell things soon because my disease\nmatures. You will ask me, \"Why did you not join the\nMuslim society?\"\nIf I go alone what can I do there? Even there I need at\nleast ten thousand people, only then I can be with rights.\nYou will say that mullahs and superstitions exist even there.\nIf we go with a sizeable crowd, even our country will\nbecome a true Muslim state like the Muslim countries of\nEgypt and Turkey. There is no necessity for superstitions in\nthe rules of the Muslim religion. Even if it is there, I know\nabout Egypt and Turkey. I say that it is enough if Egypt,\nTurkey and Persia remain Muslim. There is no need for\ngarbs there. There is the essentiality only for the heart. The\ngovernment officials will behave with integrity then. There\nwill be no Brahmin menace. They will tremble or run away\nto Hindustan (north India). We will not have any type of\ndisgrace or problem. We can be a large egalitarian society.\nWe can be independent Muslims. We will also get the\nsupport of Pakistan in the north. Exploitation will be\neradicated. I say this only for the time when nothing is\npossible. I say this because nobody should say that we do\nnot have any plan. We must not be so.\nYouth must think over this. Comrades Ambedkar and\nseveral personalities involved in public service have also\nsaid the same. Still I am not saying this-as some enemies\nand poisonous people allege-because Islam and the\nIslamic God will easily forgive the sins and make heaven\nnearer as compared to other religions.\nMan is a creature who has to live together. That has\nbeen spoilt by Hinduism, gods of Hinduism, the great\npeople and big shots of Hinduism, its leaders and they have\nmade us into slaves for the Brahmins, themselves and those\n203\n\n\fwho are favorable to them. To change that, quit Hinduism to\nbecome people who are fit for human social life. I say this\nonly for that reason. If you dare to do this, the Brahmin will\nstep down and come. Even the Government will certainly\nbecome credible. What more do you want?\n[Viduthalai, 1-5-1943]\nAbolition of Caste and Communal Representation\nThe plans of Justice Party differ from the Congress mainly\nin two ways. In Congress, all old puranas and caste\ndifferences should be protected. Each caste should protect\nits ethics and have the right to practice its codes and\ncustoms; it also guarantees them that it will protect such\ncommunal and ritualistic rights. Suppose we accept this\nplan, it implies that we have accepted our Sudrahood and\nthe untouchable caste. Also it means that we accept\nvarnashrama dharma, Pariah, Brahmin and low/ high status.\nToday's Congress demonstrations are only to protect\nBrahminism and Panchamahood and not for any public\ngood.\nIf in the Indian republic, there was one line that states\n'there will be no caste like Brahmins and Pariahs and there\nwould be no castes, so no difference,' then I will not talk\nabout communal representation or any such reservation. In\nthat case, the Congress can find a place to protest, or to\nquestion my plans. On the contrary, Congress is protecting\nand establishing the old dharma as well as guaranteeing\ntheir right to practice differences in castes! If that is the\ncase, what are our rights? And when we question these\ndifferences why do you call us traitors?\nThe Brahmins, after completely protecting their high\ncasteness, go to the low castes and ask them to accept their\nlow status and their heinousness. Are we such big fools to\naccept this from the Brahmins who call us as lowborn for\nthe sake of their living! The crores of non-Brahmins should\nfirst take up the mission of annihilating caste and treat\neveryone with equality.\n\n204\n\n\fWhat is Swaraj other than this? Every one of you\nshould think about this. Think of all the non-Brahmins who\ndo not accept the Congress policies. They first accept the\nBrahmins' supremacy by which they directly accept their\nSudrahood and thereby accept they are born of prostitutes\nand thereby they accept it as their ardent duty to serve the\nBrahmins. That is why when I ask for communal\nrepresentation and annihilation of castes, by no means is it a\ncontradiction to their policy.\nCaste difference can be annihilated only by law and not\nby common man's acceptance. Based on caste, one class of\npeople do not do any work but at the same time they exploit\nothers and live on the labour of the majority, which labours\nvery hard and goes without even a square meal a day. So to\ngive communal representation and annihilate caste legally is\nnot a difficult task.\nIf Congress abolishes castes by its initiatives or by law,\nwhy are we going to demand communal representation?\nThis basic idea would go by itself. As long as caste is alive,\nthere is no wrong in asking for communal representation in\nreservation in all employment and educational institutions.\nIs it wrong to question the Congress that is trying to save\ncaste and caste differences? We can achieve complete\nequality by giving communal representation in all posts,\nwhich will certainly annihilate the disgrace of\nuntouchability, the ruin due to alcoholism and lack of\neducation. If we live in unity, we can certainly make\nreformations and thereby lead a proper life. The Congress\nsays we are slaves to rich! How can we accept this? Only\nthose who get money from the Brahmins for their own\nliving say this. So we need not bother about all these.\n[Dravidar Nadu, 30-5-1943]\nDravidians and Hindus\nThe resolution passed in the Tiruvarur conference in 1940,\nsaid that it is wrong to call ourselves as 'Indians', 'Hindus',\nor 'people of Bharath' and instead we should call ourselves\n'Dravidar', 'Rationalist' and 'people of the Dravidian\n\n205\n\n\fcountry.' As we do not have such feelings we are made to\ndisgracefully suffer all the complaints and humiliation that\nhinders our progress. If we say we are 'Hindus', then\naccording to the Varnashrama Dharma of the Hindu\nreligion, Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Sudra and\nPanchamas are the 5 divisions and we are in the 4th and the\n5th divisions so we become the degraded lowest caste. These\nconcepts exist according to law, religion, Sastras and the\nexisting rules and regulations. This made us accept it wholeheartedly with tolerance. So we call ourselves only as\nDravidians and not as Hindus.\n[Kudiarasu, 29-9-1943]\nReligious discrimination\nIn the name of religion and in the name of law, among the\nHindus, there is the fourth caste, the fifth caste (Sudra,\nPanchama)-that is the Brahmins call us Sudra and 'low'\npeople-and we receive only the corresponding legal rights,\nsocial rights and treatment.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-11-1943]\nCasteist disgrace\nThough several among us consider them to be low castes,\ndegraded castes and treat them so and likewise give\njudgments in the courts, they think, \"if our respect goes, let\nit go, if we get wealth and position it is enough,\" and they\ntry to forget and hide their shame. If someone reminds\nthem, or exposes it, they only get angry or try to take\nrevenge, but they do not have a correct idea of their\ndisgrace.\n[Kudiarasu, 6-11-1943]\nCasteism\nOnly due to caste some people are rich and some remain\npoor.\n[Kudiarasu, 25-3-1944]\n\n206\n\n\fCaste domination\nThe nation is deteriorating and degenerating with several\nsocial problems because of caste. Each caste feels that\npersons of their caste should come to position, so it\ndominates other castes. Thus there is problem in every\nvillage.\n[Kudiarasu, 11-11-1944]\nPartition of Dravidar Nadu\nWhen we speak of the partition of Dravidar Nadu we have\nto make a note of\n1. Madras Presidency alone shall be Dravidar Nadu.\n2. If people of other states have to step into the\nDravidar Nadu they have to get visa.\n3. Only with the permission and after paying required\nduty, they can come to Dravidar Nadu to buy/ sell\nthings.\n4. The increase or decrease of the area of the country\nis dependent on our comforts and wishes.\n5. Foreigners doing business or handicrafts will\ndepend only on our needs.\nTill we get complete independence the security will remain\nas it is. Muslims, Adi Dravidas, Christians, Buddhists are all\nDravidas. Their religion and their religious activity will\ncontinue to be the same, that is, as per their wishes.\n[Kudiarasu, 2-12-1944]\nQuit Hinduism\nIf a foreigner rules our nation, for his benefit he controls us\nby divide and rule policy. Likewise, the native people of our\nnation are permanently controlled by the foreigners i.e. the\noutsider Aryans by using tools like god, religion, Vedas and\nSastras that has divided us into classes.\nBecause of this, the majority of us have become\nbackward class people and Untouchables and they rule us.\nSo we have become base people having no right even to call\nourselves as human. A few of us are not aware of it. Shed\n\n207\n\n\faway the concept of god, religion, Puranas, Sastras and\nepics. I came here with all difficulties just to say this.\nIf you all do not follow this, even after a thousand\nyears, whatever conferences or campaigns you hold, or\ndemonstrations you carry out, whatever be the political\nindependence you get, whatever be your economic\ndevelopment, whatever be your degrees and positions, the\nheinous disgrace will not be wiped in your society. This is\ncertain! This is certain! All of you are going to do the same\nmistakes your forefathers have done. So, you would do the\nsame mistakes in your lifetime also. You can only do\nmistakes like them but not rectify any of it.\nSo, all gods and religions that stands as evidence for our\ndisgrace must be ruthlessly cut away. It is utter foolishness\nto think of correcting or reforming Hinduism or its related\nconcepts like religion, god, or Sastras.\nThe only intelligent thing to do is to come away from\nHindu religion to save ourselves from any form of disgrace.\nIf we have to utter any other word for Hindu religion, it is\nnothing but Aryan or Brahminism. If you have any doubts\nregarding this, kindly see the dictionary written by\nintellectuals. Don't become victims of the traitors. What\nhappened to the efforts of Buddha, Sankara and Ramanuja?\nOnly to annihilate Buddha, heroes like Rama, Krishna and\npuranas like Ramayana and Gita were created. When\nAmbedkar visited Chennai, I elaborated to him on what I\nhad said in a massive conference in 1923 that unless one\nburns the Ramayana, untouchability couldn't be abolished.\nAccordingly there are large groups that burn the Ramayana\nand also large support for it.\nOver 15,000 people have left Hinduism and have come\nto the Self Respect Movement. They have thrown away\ntheir Sanskritised names and have taken a Tamil name.\nThey have left all symbols, which identifies them as\nHindus.\nOur people want a separate state mainly because they\nwant to lead a life without disgrace. They should not be the\nvictims of Aryan supremacy and socio-economic ill\n\n208\n\n\ftreatment. The leaders of the Depressed Classes,\nDr.Ambedkar and Sivaraj have also spoken in this manner.\nQuit Hinduism and call yourself to be of any religion\nyou like. By accepting the fact that we are born in\nHinduism, we accept Varnashrama dharma. To wipe away\nthe disgrace we have to abandon Aryan supremacy by\nabandoning god, religion, Sastras and puranas.\n[Kudiarasu, 13-1-1945]\nElections\nI will say something of importance to that society. Those\nwho are the leaders of the Depressed Classes must not hold\nany office, and they must not have affinity, desire or\nnecessity to hold office. Apart from leaders, the others may\nget position, titles, power, salary, and rewards, in the name\nof their society. But the leaders must not look that side.\nNinety percent of the time, the Government gives position,\ntitle, job, salary, reward, to the leaders mainly to punish and\noppress that section of people, make them amiable, make\nthem enemies of their enemies, and not for any other reason.\nAt the least, those who get such positions must leave the\nleadership to someone else and look after their work. If the\nsame person takes both the leadership position and the\nposition that gives authority, title and salary, it is difficult\nfor him and his society to have respect in the eyes of the\nGovernment and the public.\nSo, this is a crucial time where we have to fight by\nuprooting and not respecting the laws and policies. At this\ntime, the Legislative Assembly, the nature of the Legislative\nAssembly, is not possible for us, and even if it is possible it\nis not suitable for us. I say this on the basis of 20 years of\ncontinuous experience. So, at least to an extent, the people\nwho are the Depressed Classes should leave title, position,\nlegislative assembly, etc. to those who believe it or have the\nneed for it. They need to stand out and get ready to struggle.\nI request the true and strong-willed comrades.\nThis is my answer to the comrades who asked me about\nelections to the legislative assembly.\n\n209\n\n\f[Kudiarasu, 2-2-1946]\nCaste System\nIt must be mentioned that though the British have come to\nthis country and ruled for 200 years, even today thousands\nof people continue to be Backward Classes and Depressed\nClasses, divided into thousands of groups and are\ndifferentiated as high and low, and on the basis of this there\nis struggle between them.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-3-1946]\nPartition\nWhether the British leave truly or falsely, if Pakistan is\ncreated and Dravidar Nadu is attached to it, somehow the\nAryan atrocity will be removed from the Dravidian land.\nIn this 20th century, the Dravidians-who are the\nindigenous people of this country, who are the descendants\nof kings who ruled not only this land, but several other\ncountries-face a disgrace and barrier to humane existence\nand cruelty of slavery that even the Muslims who are called\nMlechas and base by the Aryans don't face; and if this has\nbeen the practice for thousands of years, even after the rule\nof the British it has existed for two hundred years, and if\nSwaraj is being demanded in order to preserve this, not only\nwill the Dravidian hate such a kind of Swaraj, why will he\nnot ask for the rule of Pakistan, or rule of Afghanistan, or\nany other rule that is non-Aryan? This is our question.\n[Kudiarasu, 13-4-1946]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nThe Aryans have purposefully fabricated several false\nstories without any honesty, they state these as the history\nof the nation in schools, so these have become ingrained in\nthe brains of the people in such a way that they think it is\ntrue that the Brahmins are the highest honorable caste and\nthe sons of this soil are degraded people and Untouchables.\nHow can a rationalist with self-respect accept all these?\n\n210\n\n\fFestivals are celebrated according to the puranic stories,\nlikewise, if political power from puranas is imposed, when\nwill there be development?\nEven we have become slaves of the Congressmen i.e.\nwe live like corpses. Even today, nothing else but leadership\nin politics remains primary for Gandhi. He claims himself to\nbe the leader of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and\nUntouchables. On this basis he is treated respectfully. But in\npolitics can we accept bhajans and prayers to Rama if he\n(Gandhi) is a leader of one and all?\n[Viduthalai, 12-6-1946]\nDravidar Nadu\nIf we had the feeling of our nation (Dravidar Nadu), feeling\nof independence and self-respect, can we have Nehru Park,\nGandhi Chowk and Tilak Square here? Can we call this\ncomplete independence? By looking at this, does not your\nmind become tensed? Does your stomach not burn?\nIn South Africa, there is the cruelty of the whites and in\nDravidar Nadu there are Aryan atrocities. Dravidians in\nDravidar Nadu are tortured by Aryans. Dravidians in\nDravidar Nadu are called by Aryans as Untouchables,\nChandalas, sons of prostitutes, and slaves. Does any\nDravidian become mentally tensed because of this? Are\nAryans in a 'guru' status to the Dravidians? Is the Aryan a\nholy man, a master, boss, judge, collector, magistrate and\nfamily guru to a Sudra? What evidence do we need to state\nthat we are shameless society and that our country is a\nbarbaric slave country?\n[Kudiarasu, 6-7-1946]\nHinduism and Untouchability\nGandhi often says that untouchability is the curse on\nHinduism. He says this because of the hidden reason that\nHinduism has to be protected. If Gandhi was a true person\nor if he was intelligent, he would have understood that if the\nHindu religion was not there untouchability would not be\nthere and that if untouchability was not there, Hinduism\n\n211\n\n\fwould not be there. Hinduism exists in order to protect\nUntouchability, and Untouchability is not there to protect\nHinduism, or as a curse on Hinduism. This is because we\nknow that anywhere in the world where there is no\nuntouchability, Hinduism is not there, and where there is no\nHindu religion, there is no untouchability.\nNo one can show a specific doctrine anywhere that is\nsupposed to be Hinduism.\nBut to create Untouchability and caste difference at\nbirth, to protect it and to degrade a few people, and to\nconjoin in one society the people and the degraded people,\nthese two aspects are properly and carefully stressed and\nthis conspiracy that was created through experience is given\nthe name Hinduism. And there is no place or truth or\nevidence to say that someone created it at some point of\ntime as a religion. So, it is impossible to have a Hindu\nreligion without untouchability or untouchability-eradicated\nHindu religion.\nIf untouchability is abolished there will be no need for\nanyone to save Hinduism. If untouchability is eradicated,\nnot only will the Hindus have to join one of the religions of\nIslam, Christianity, Brahmo Samaj, Jeevakarunya Samaj,\nUniversal Brotherhood, and there will be no place or\nnecessity for them to say that they are Hindu.\nSome may say \"there are several Gods in Hinduism,\nunlike in other religions. So, at least for several Gods to\nexist there will be something called Hinduism.\" These\nseveral gods were also created only on the basis of\nuntouchability and caste difference and there is no one God\nwho is without caste difference. After caste distinction and\nuntouchability are annihilated, a lot of its foundation will be\nlost so the concept of polytheism will not have place and\nthere will not be a religion separately for that purpose.\nSo, because of caste discrimination, the Hindu religion\nis the dream weapon of a malicious lazy group that\noppresses others and makes them into slaves and grows fat\non others' labour.\n[Kudiarasu, 24-8-1946]\n\n212\n\n\fCongress and Untouchability\nCongressmen used to blame all the previous regimes saying\nthat they were not concerned about the eradication of\nuntouchability. They boasted, \"If only we capture the\nministerial cabinet, in one second we will eradicate\nuntouchability through laws.\"\nWe have never considered that merely due to getting the\ntemple entry right, our indigenous people will get education\nor improved living standards. Even now we do not think so.\nBecause, if see whether all the people of the different\nsections of society who can enter into the temple today have\ndeveloped in the field of education and economy, we can\nunderstand that temple entry is not an important problem\ntoday. Moreover, we see from experience that because of\ntemple entry, only the intelligence, money and time of\npeople are getting ruined.\nSince the temple is the abode of religion, god, codes\nand tradition that are (said to be) obstacles to the rights that\nhave to be given to the indigenous people, we need to\nsupport the temple entry struggle.\n[Viduthalai, 12-9-1946]\nAbolition of Untouchability\nIt is not possible to eradicate untouchability unless a law\nthat makes untouchability a criminal offence is passed.\nToday, the Legislative Assemblies have become\nCongressized. The ministers are only Congressmen. So, if\ntheir whole-hearted feeling that untouchability has to be\neradicated, why are they still silent? At least from this, will\nour Depressed Class comrades understand that 'Harijan\nSeva' is a mere deception?\n[Viduthalai, 12-9-1946]\nNaming/ Terming\nI was shocked to see in the records that they mentioned the\nsocial status as Christian, Brahmin, and Muslim etc. but for\n\n213\n\n\fall other it was mentioned as non-Brahmins. We nonBrahmins are the sons of this soil and how are we termed. I\nsuggested that we should be called as Dravidians and the\nBrahmins must be called as non-Dravidians or Aryans.\n[Viduthalai, 18-9-1946]\nCongress and Caste\nThe Dravidian comrades in the Congress! Why do you\nstand as an obstacle for us? We do not need the British; we\ndo not need them for anything. We, who ruled the country,\nserve as peons, butlers and constables after the British\ncame. But the section of people who were begging, today\nserve as High Court Judge, Advocate General, Diwan,\nMinister, Sankaracharya and Bhagwans.\nThe Aryans know that once the British quit, only you,\nthe Dravidian comrades of the Congress, will cut the tuft\nand the sacred thread that are symbol of the Brahmin's\nadvancement and our lowliness.\nThe British are supportive to the Brahmins. This is a\npact between the white Aryan and the yellow Aryan. What\nis going to be produced from now is the same pact. All the\nrest are gimmicks. I said this two years ago. Ambedkar and\nJinnah say this now. Swaraj is only an effort to protect\ntoday's social structure. An example for this is that when\nwe said that there should be no difference in food in\nTiruvaiyaru, Mahaganam Sastri, P.S.Sivasamy Iyer,\nT.R.Venkatarama Sastri and others said to the British, \"You\nare violating our agreement.\" This is what we need to break.\nIn a country with a great deal of caste and religious\ndifferences, what is wrong if the Muslims, a group that has\nonly one doctrine, decide to separate themselves, that too in\nplaces where they are greater than sixty percentage? Why\nthis obstacle? Will the country split? Will the country\nexplode? If there is opposition to this, it is because of the\nrevolt created by the British and the Aryans. Do the British\nnot know of the strife and vulgarities here? Will the British\nnot laugh when they see that there is a caste called the\n\n214\n\n\fBrahmin, and a caste called the Pariah and that a caste\ncannot enter hotels?\n[Kudiarasu, 9-10-1946]\nSudras and Untouchables\nAs said in the Ramayana, even if a pair of slippers rule (the\nnation) we are not worried. But the Sudra title that we, and\nthe working class people of our race have in the Sastras, in\nthe laws, and in practice must be annihilated. The Brahmin\ntitle of the lazy cheats must be abolished. Is there any\nCongress doctrine or policy that caste differences and the\nstigma of birth must be annihilated from Sastras, religion\nand Gods? Has any leader said this at any time? If you want\nsend a telegram to Gandhi now. See if he agrees. Right from\nRaman's time, the upper and lower castes such as\nBrahmins, Paraiyans and Sudras existed. The Ramayana\nsays that only after the Sudra who prayed to God was killed\nand the dead Brahmin child came back to life. Right from\nHarishchandra's time, the Paraiyan caste exists. So, only to\nremove such humiliation, the Dravidar Kazhagam functions\nas a true, incomparable establishment.\n[Kudiarasu, 12-10-1946]\nDravidians\nIf the Madras Presidency has to function with complete\nindependence, anyone who has to enter the Madras\nPresidency-whether it is the Birlas, Tatas, Mahatmas,\nNehrus, British-they need to get a visa. No north Indian\nshould be our leader, President or Mahatma.\nMan should live with equality. In the human race, there\nshould be no Paraiyar, Sudra, Chakkiliyar or Brahmin or\nUntouchables. Like other nations of the world, we should\nlive like a separate independent nation. Among our 5 crore\npeople anyone can be a minister, a Mahatma. Don't we have\nqualified people?\nHere the Dravidians are the fourth caste. A group of\npeople who are not Dravidians are the first caste. 90% of the\npopulation who are Dravidians is considered as Sudras,\n\n215\n\n\fPanchamas and degraded people by the laws and the\nSastras.\nShould the Dravidians not live like humans? Should the\nDravidar Nadu not become a nation without degraded\npeople? In the present days there is no value for throne or\ncrown. Today's need is only democratic rule. Whoever is an\nhonest moral humanitarian can wield power.\nThe Indian subcontinent is 3000 miles long and 2000\nmiles broad. From ancient days, people have developed a\nlot of differences here. One does not eat in another's house,\ndoes not perform inter-caste marriages. Several languages,\nseveral castes, several upper and lower differences exist.\nThey don't touch each other. If they happen to touch, they\nperform purification in various ways as mentioned in the\nVedas.\nThere is no nation in the world with such differences.\nCan a big subcontinent with so many differences be a single\nnation; if it is to be under a single rule how can we accept\nit? If Dravidar Nadu is to be partitioned according to my\nrequest, what discomfort does any Indian undergo?\n[Kudiarasu, 19-10-1946]\nSocial Equality\nIf we take the social status of lay people in western\ncountries, there is no social difference based on birth. All\nare equal. Among the public, there is no feeling of high or\nlow by birth. Everyone has every social right. Nobody has\nany kind of discomfort or disgrace because of his birth. The\ncruelty of untouchability does not exist there. Whether it is\nthe temple, or the hotels, or any public place everyone has\nequal rights, no difference is entertained. On the basis of\nbirth, education, and status, priesthood or religious headship\nis not created, and this practice of exploitation has not been\nformed (there). Anyone can attain any education, any job\nand any position.\nBecause the people remain as one society, and because\nthey have equal rights, their unity and discipline and\ncommon aim has grown and those countries' have attained\n\n216\n\n\fdevelopment because of their society and they are a\ncompletely independent society.\nThis country's society has been divided in the name of\nbirth. So, here the people have been divided into several\ngroups. Here, to respect anybody the first task is to consider\nhis birth. In society, status has been ascribed based on birth;\nseveral discomforts have been created for man on the basis\nof his birth. Whatever a man's integrity, he is either exalted\nor made lowly because of his birth.\n[Kudiarasu, 2.11.1946]\nBirth-based discrimination\nIn India just by seeing a person-by his dress, symbols he\nputs on his forehead and language-one can say to which\nreligion he belongs! To exhibit the external and internal\nreligious feelings is considered to be good. There are\nseveral gods and their history is abundant. Because of these,\nsociety has been divided and unity is lost; they oppress and\ndominate others based on the lowness and highness of caste.\nThe nation has been ruined only due to religion. This will\nonly increase the difference and the notion of low caste.\nWhile talking about political parties one can only talk\nmore on caste divisions and not the principles. Apart from\nthis, there is a separate political assembly for Adi Dravidars,\nwhich has many crores of members, likewise there is a\nspecial but a different assembly for the Brahmins. Sufficient\nmoney is not spent for the education, social equality of\nUntouchables, etc. Likewise, for the Christians. Though the\nVarnashrama dharma-ists are very small in number, yet they\nhave a Mahasabha: the Congress that caters to all their\nneeds.\nThe Brahmin lives in luxury and spends at least 70\ntimes on himself compared to what an untouchable spends\non himself. If we consider the social status of a common\nman in western countries there is no discrimination by birth,\nall are equal. There is no low or high in respecting a\ncommon man. They enjoy equal rights.\nThere is no discomfort or discrimination due to birth.\nThere is no untouchability. The cruelty that one should not\n\n217\n\n\fcome near another does not exist. Whether it is the temples\nor streets or shops, all are equal. One is not exalted in\neducation, or status or religion because of one's birth. In\ngeneral, one does not exploit the other. Anyone can achieve\neducation or any post. That is why these nations have\nbecome developed ones. But in our country social status is\nbased on birth. That is why we are divided into several\ncastes. So the first duty of anyone in India is to find his\nbirth! Based on his birth, he is respected or disrespected!\nBecause of these, men face severe discomfort and\ndiscrimination. Based on birth, untouchability is practiced!\nSome cannot be touched, some cannot even be seen, these\nUntouchables cannot use common roads, lakes, temple,\nhotels, etc. Even in classrooms they are discriminated. Even\njobs are based on their birth. A class of people are given\nmenial jobs; like scavenging is allotted to the Depressed\nClasses. The nation has no common objective. All common\nobjectives are for the comfort of one class of people, the\nBrahmins. If untouchability exists how can there be unity\nand love among people?\nSo one not only respects other religions, but also thinks\nvery low of his religion and considers it as his enemy. So,\nonly Hinduism is the cause for all differences, the lack of\nunity and common objective that has hindered all\ndevelopments and made the nation remain as a backward\none.\n[Kudiarasu, 9-11-1946]\nNeed for unity\nIf we still continue to remain divided it will only create\nmisery for us. If we are divided because of political and\nreligious differences, and keep fighting and hitting one\nanother, it is very very disgraceful to our race. Apart from\nthe conspiracy of enemies, and shameless, selfish, meanmindedness what else is the reason for the splits and fights\namong us?\nLook at the Brahmins: do they have such fights among\nthemselves? Has a Brahmin ever beaten another? Has he\n\n218\n\n\ftroubled another Brahmin? No matter how selfish, a\nBrahmin's selfishness is used for the welfare of his society.\nThis is a very crucial time. If we don't unite at this time,\nif we don't protect ourselves, we will come to be in an even\nlower position.\nIf all the Muslims are killed and if it is ensured that not\none of them remains in the Dravidar Nadu-Come to a\nconclusion that this has been done! What next? What will\nhappen next? Think and see!\nYou and I and Kamaraj and Muthurangam and\nBhaktavatsalam, the Pandarams, the Rajah Sir, Maharaja\nSir, Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar, Sir Shanmugam, Kalyana\nSundaram, are they not Sudras? Are they not traditional,\nHindu Sudras? Comrades Ambedkar, Sivashanmugam,\nMunusamy Pillai, Goormaiya, Sivaraj are all Paraiyars,\nChakkilis, Panchamas. Are they not people of the last caste?\nIf these are unchanged, why the need for any Swaraj, or\ncarnage, or confusion, or loot? For what? To make the\nBrahmin into the Brahman, and the Brahman into a\nBhudeva (Lord of the earth)? Don't we need intelligence?\nDon't we need shame? Are we really low people? If we\nlisten to the Brahmins and dance accordingly, poke the\neyes, cut the legs, set ablaze and destroy our own people, do\nwe need carnage, nationalism and Swaraj?\nComrades! After we get Swaraj, if Comrade\nAvinashilingam Chettiar says that we (Dravidians/ Sudras)\ndo not have the status or the talent, after we get complete\nSwaraj what will the Brahmins not say? Today, the Brahmin\nis gleefully butchering the Muslims. Tomorrow they are\ngoing to call the Dravidians butchering the Dravidians as\n\"October Sacrifice.\" I will say that this will certainly\nhappen.\n[Viduthalai, 23-11-1946]\nAnnihilation of Caste\nWhen the people got the emotion of political freedom, the\nnecessity, of feeling that the British government was totally\nnot needed, was created. Likewise, because the social\n\n219\n\n\ffeeling was created social self-respect was created and\npeople hated the feeling of low caste, and in anger they said\nthat they didn't need this religion. This emotion comes to\nanyone who has the feeling of self-respect. There is no use\nif anyone feels sorry for it.\nIf each and every person is a Panchama, he will\nunderstand how important it is for him to become a\nChristian or a Muslim. When someone is getting thrashed\nfor being a Paraiyan or a Chakkili, he scavenges and\nremains an untouchable, and someone else comes and\nlectures to him not to become a Muslim or a Christian; this\nis devoid of status or integrity.\nParaiyan, Chakkiliyan, Pallan, Pulayan, Cheruman,\nKuravan, Naavidhan, they are named and called\nhumiliatingly. Only today are they being called\nUntouchables? Right from the time of the Ramayana and\nMahabharata, right from the time of the Vedas, Sastras and\nPuranas, several thousand years have passed. Who will give\nthe compensation/ retribution for that? Which government\nwill give the compensation for that? Which party will do\nthat? Don't we know the information about the great leaders\nof yesteryears like Vijayaraghavachari, Pundit Malaviya?\nThey only campaigned for the Varnashrama Dharma. But\nthe Brahmins are doing propaganda that they are\nnationalists. Our people who are crazy are also singing\nalong for the sake of money, or due to foolishness.\nThere is no use in getting angry with me. I will bet that\nin today's situation, there is no other way to eradicate the\nstate of low castes than joining Islam or Christianity.\nGandhi says that untouchability is not there, but not a\nsingle day does he say that upper-caste lower-caste is not\nthere. But instead he says, \"I will establish the Ram Rajya\nwhich is based on Varnashrama Dharma. I live only to\nestablish it, for that reason alone we need Swaraj.\" Can any\nCongressman deny this?\nIs there any policy of annihilation of caste in the\nCongress? Untouchability is different; caste is different.\nWithout understanding this there are several SudraPanchama comrades in the Congress who are cheated and\n220\n\n\fget angry with us. I pity them. As long as Hinduism is there,\nthe differences of Brahmin, Sudra and Panchama will not\ngo. Caste difference will never go until Gita, Ramayana,\nManu dharma and so on are trampled. That is why Gandhi\nand the Congress cautiously do not talk about caste.\nHe who does not like to become a Muslim or Christian\nand likes to be a Sudra or Panchama can be silent just like\nthat! I am not worried about it. But why should he prevent\nothers? Why must he blame others? This is my question.\nAs far as Swaraj is concerned, the Congressmen must\nkeep working till they chase out the British. Why must they\nsave the Hindu religion, protect the title of Sudra and\nPanchama, and prevent people from going to other\nreligions? From this, is it not known that the Congress party\nis a religious establishment; it is an establishment that\nprotects Hindu religion, caste and varnas? What mistake is\nthere in Jinnah and Dr.Ambedkar calling the Congress a\nHindu establishment?\nWhen Dr.Ambedkar said, \"I am not a Hindu; the people\nwho accept me as their leader are not Hindus. I have the\nright to embrace any religion\"-why should the\nCongressmen oppose it? That too, why should a\nCongressman who accepts himself as a Sudra and who\nconsiders Ambedkar and his society as Paraiyars, Chakkilis,\nPanchamas oppose it?\nThe Dravidar Kazhagam or the Scheduled Caste\nFederation has taken the annihilation of caste as their plan\nof Swaraj, so they need to talk and struggle for its sake.\nWhat else? If the Dravidian Congress comrades have\nconcern, let them release a statement.\nThat is, let comrades Avinashilingam, Bhaktavatsalam\nand Kamaraj release a statement that \"In the Swaraj\nobtained by the Congress, there will be no Sudra, no\nPanchama, there will be no religious basis for this. There\nwill be only one God and one caste.\" Those with shame and\nrage can go and demand this in writing from Gandhi,\nRajagopalachari and Prakasam. Instead of that why does the\nCongress get angry and assault us-the Dravidian and\n\n221\n\n\fScheduled castes who say that we are not Sudras, we are not\nPanchamas.\nNo one needs to worry about the Scheduled castes\nembracing Islam or Christianity. Other than that, they have\nno other option. No one has shown another way. Their\norganization is there to eradicate their Panchama-ness and\nnot for (contesting seats to the) Legislative Assembly or\n(acquiring) the post of Minister. We have to realize that\nonly a few will get it.\nIf a Hindu-Muslim riot takes place in this nation, this\nwill be the next work. That is the people will have to\nconvert their religion. The riot takes place only to hasten\nthat process. Because of the Hindu-Muslim riots, the\nScheduled Caste Minister, MLA, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim,\nChristian everyone will become one religion. This is\nconfirmed. Except the Scheduled Caste Ministers,\nSecretary, MLA everyone else will join Islam. This is\ndefinite.\nNote: After Periyar finished speaking, some 100 Scheduled\nCaste comrades suddenly came towards the stage beating\nleather drums of various kinds. It caused an agitation in the\nmeeting. Periyar called for a calm. After that, in front of\nPeriyar they made a heap of those instruments. One of them\ngot on the dais and said,\"We are called Paraiyars only\nbecause we beat the Parai. From now, we are not going to\nbeat the Parai. Certainly we are not going to beat the Parai\nfor the house of death, or for birth or for God. We have now\ntaken a resolve. So, we are burning that instrument.\"\nHaving said so, they poured four or five liters of kerosene\non it and set it on fire. Everyone applauded seeing it\nflaming away. They shouted, \"We will convert after we get\nthe permission of Dr.Ambedkar\" as they departed.\n[Viduthalai, 23-11-1946]\nRepresentation for Depressed Classes\nDr.Ambedkar got the permission that Adi-Dravidars must\nbe given 12.5% positions and employment. On receiving\n\n222\n\n\fthis order, the Chennai Government said, \"we are not\ngetting qualified people\" and they put that order in the\ndustbin. If the Chennai ministers ask for the proportion,\nthey say that it is against nationalism.\nIf they see people who beat them, immediately they will\ngive everything. If they see slaves, Sudras, Panchamas, they\nwill trample them. This is Indian nationalism. This is also\nthe Swaraj of the Presidencies.\n[Kudiarasu, 30-11-1946]\nConversion to Islam\nLet anyone suggest some other remedy for the atrocities of\nthese Brahmins.\nIn the Dravidian nation, a Muslim can lead a life of his\nown comforts and not according to the wishes of a mullah. I\nknow the rules followed by 10 Islamic nations, the rules\nonly cater to the majority. It is not like the Hindu religion,\nwhere 3 18 % of the Brahmins say to the non-Brahmins,\nwho form 93% of the population \"to stand at a distance,\"\n\"you should not study,\" \"you are Sudra,\" \"you are a son of a\nprostitute,\" \"you cannot have equality,\" \"you cannot have a\njob,\" \" you cannot have communal representation.\"\nIslam preaches brotherhood, peace and kindness among\none another. It is a path for unity. This cannot be refuted. I\ndo not support or advocate Islam. What I say is the perfect\nand only truth. I do not have love or affection or faith or any\nother form of relationship with Islam. But in Hinduism the\ncruelties of the Brahmins are so atrocious, cruel, and\nunbearable like the poison of an ugly cobra. Islam is the\nonly medicine to save Hindus from the poison of the cobra.\nTo correctly know Islam, please tour through Turkey, Egypt\nand England.\n\"Islam is the way to remove disgrace\" is the only\nmantra that can make you lead life like a human. I did not\nadvocate this today or yesterday. I have been saying this for\nthe past 28 years i.e., from 1919 or 1920 till date (1947). I\nhave not lost popularity. The main reason for this is the fact\nthat the only medicine to remove social disgrace is Islam.\n\n223\n\n\fAll medicines that have been used to cure this disease of\ndisgrace have only faced a failure.\nIf the Scheduled Castes are given communal\nrepresentation in employment and education then these\nBrahmins can sit luxuriously in the rest of the places. What\nwill be the plight of the Sudras? What is their future? What\nis the representation of Sudras in politics?\nThere are representatives of the Scheduled castes and\nBrahmins. There are representatives for the Sankaracharyas.\nWhere is the representation for the agitated Sudras? Think\nwith self-respect! Not only post and positions, but also think\nabout the ideals! We should live without disgrace. The only\nmedicine for this is Islam.\nGo home, think and discuss with all great people and\ncome and inform about your decision. Thank you for\nlistening to me without throwing stones and making\nproblems.\n100 salaams.\n[Ina Izhivu Ozhiya Islam Nanmarunthu! 1947]\nI am not a Hindu\nWhy should there be stumbling blocks of \"credentials and\nmerit\" for the Dravidian alone? Credentials and merit is not\nneeded for the Muslims, it is not needed for the British, it is\nnot needed for the Anglo-Indians, and it is not needed for\nthe Adi-Dravidas who threaten to leave to another religion.\nBut the Dravidian needs to be qualified and meritorious in\norder to even get enrolled in school-if the Swarajist\nBrahmin Prime Minister uses the Dravidian Education\nMinister in his Government to bring about such a policy,\nyou can notice how forcefully the Laws of Manu and\ntreachery are in practice.\nThough the Adi-Dravidas and the Muslims have been\nvery badly treated, they have won a prize. Though it is not\nthe first prize it is a good prize. Their position has\nimproved. Now they will get the correct communal\nrepresentation, they will certainly get even more. Now,\n\n224\n\n\ffacilities to hear their recommendations and grievances\nhave been formed.\nI will say that unless we become either the Panchamas\n(that is the Adi Dravidas) or Muslims we shall not have a\nlife of respect, wealth, or progress.\nComrades! Yesterday in this same place, in the midst of\nabout 20,000 people I stressed this in front of our leader\nVedachalam who presided over the meeting. I said the same\nthing yesterday morning, when I presided over the Dr.\nAmbedkar Students Hostel celebrations that took place at\nthe municipality office. Some people said that because of\nthis, I am earning a bad name among the Dravidians. Even\ntoday morning some people said this. A few people remain\nwith me and say this and carry on a poisonous campaign. I\nam not worried about this.\nI am not even a little worried that I should earn a good\nname from such Dravidians who do not have any place for\nemotions and do not bother about respect. My life is not\nbased on such a fake reputation. Serve the Dravidians, in\nthat I do not have any botheration other than the anxiety and\nexpectation that the disgrace of the Dravidians must be\nremoved. I am not worried about my life; I do not have the\nobstinacy to achieve something else. Today the disgrace the\nDravidian faces is that he has to be a Hindu who has to be a\nSudra.\nDr. Ambedkar, the sudden fortune that has come to the\nAdi Dravidars said, \"I am not a Hindu, I am not a\nPanchama, I am not connected with any of the\ndiscrimination of this religion.\" The temples were opened,\nthe minister asks, \"Give the list, I shall give employment.\"\nSardar Patel says, \"I shall do good to you more than the law\npermits. What do you need? Ask\", Gandhi says, \"I am a Adi\nDravida, a Bhangi\"-all this happens because of the\npowerful mantra \"I am not a Hindu.\" I said the same thing\nfive years earlier to Dr.Ambedkar in 1925. He, who said it\nfive years after me has succeeded. Yet, they are going to\nsay, \"I am not a Hindu\" \u2013at least orally-and they are going\nto get all the rights.\n\n225\n\n\fThe benefits that the Muslims have received and will\nreceive are due to this. That is, because of saying \"We are\nnot Hindus, we are not part of Indian society.\" I suggested\nDravidar Nadu in 1937, Jinnah Sahib suggested Pakistan in\n1940. Today Pakistan lies under his feet. Jinnah hits back by\nsaying, \"Scrub nicely, wash and clean and come.\" The\nDravidian people live disgracefully-as Sudras-as the 4th,\n5th caste-as the children of prostitutes, servants and slaves;\nthey are denied education, wealth, dignity, wages for\nwork-they are treated worse than animals-they have lost\ntheir rights, their humaneness, they are forced into such a\nhumiliating life-apart from being a Hindu, what else is the\nreason for this?\nThough Dr.Ambedkar has won now, if he says that he is\na Hindu after this enthusiasm is over, he shall again be\nincluded in the list of Panchamas.\n[Ina Izhivu Ozhiya Islam Nanmarunthu, 1947]\nCaste Identity\nThe Union Government decided and passed a resolution\nnever to mention subcastes in voters lists, religious\ninstitutions, school records, court records but only write as\n'Hindu', 'Muslim', 'Sikhs' or 'Christians'. When I heard\nabout this I whole-heartedly welcomed this resolution. This\nwas done mainly to protect Hinduism, since the\nUntouchables were converting themselves to Muslims and\nSikhs. They broke their heads only to save, and to make this\nnation remain, a Hindu nation. The Congress never thought\nof annihilating caste.\nThey were least bothered about caste and the\ndifferences it made in society. They did not even dream of\nannihilating caste. What is the difference if a man is\nenslaved to another due to wealth or due to caste? They\nnever think about these problems. To abolish caste, the\ngovernment should make laws to punish those who put their\ncaste names behind their name.\nEveryone who gets married should perform only intercaste marriage. Laws and rules must punish those who\nmarry within their own caste.\n\n226\n\n\fWearing the holy thread, and putting religious marks on\nthe forehead must be legally abolished and those who do it\nshould be punished. Thus, if caste is annihilated, only the\nBrahmins will be the worst affected. They entered our\ncountry seeking pasture for their cattle; they have become\nthe highest caste and the sons of the soil have become low\ncaste people. What is the reason for all these? The author of\n\"Politics of British,\" Prof. T.K. says, \"A revolutionary will\nnever become a Pope and Pope will never become a\nrevolutionary.\"\nThus a Brahmin can never become a revolutionist. Just\nlike the Pope who is all-powerful the Brahmins are much\nmore powerful. They will state, \"Can a donkey become a\nhorse? Or, do all the 5 fingers in any hand look alike?\nLikewise there are different castes.\" Till a last Brahmin\nlives in this nation, they will practice the divide and rule\npolicy. As Buddha and Gurunanak have said the Vedas and\nSastras are complete falsehood. We, the Dravidar\nKazhagam people, alone have the courage to say so.\n[Viduthalai, 10-1-1947]\nEducation\nToday's education is fully based on Varnashrama Dharma:\none man should labour and one should live lazily. So one\ngroup should be educated and the other group should be\nfools with education denied; so the very education system is\nlike Varnashrama Dharma.\n[Viduthalai, 25-1-1947]\nHinduism and Caste\nOnly because of Hindu religion there are several caste\nclashes. Otherwise there is no reason for religious fights.\nSo, taking everything into account it is better that the nonBrahmins set themselves free from the prison of Hindu\nreligion.\nThe gods and temples exist mainly to protect caste and\nthe concept of high and low based on birth.\n\n227\n\n\fWe are not allowed to enter the temples or pray to gods.\nSo why should we tolerate such discrimination and disgrace\nwhen it speaks so much on our honour? In this problem, I\nwill not discuss the question of existence of god, for it is an\nindividual's wish. But temple entry and disgrace associated\nwith it affects our honour.\nOne who goes to the temple is considered shameless\nbecause only after accepting that he is a low caste or an\nuntouchable, he enters the temple or prays from outside.\nIf it is a disgrace or dishonour one should cease to live;\nbut on the contrary, man accepts all disgraces and\ndishonours and accepts the religion and god. How can it be\nsensible? Devotees should think about it. The Brahmins do\nnot bother about anything except the label that they are the\nhighest caste.\n[Kudiarasu, 22-2-1947]\nDepressed Classes\nIn your welcome address, you mentioned about the struggle\nin Vaikom and about the work you have done for the\nwelfare of the Depressed Classes. Though it is a historical\nevent, I or my comrades or my wife Nagammai are alone\nnot the reason. I cannot forget that several women took part\nin the Vaikom struggle. We did not get that victory so\neasily. The Vaikom struggle was held to get the rights of\nwalking in the streets, drawing water from common wells\nand for temple entry for our Depressed Classes comrades.\nThe Travancore Queen of that day used several oppressive\nmeasures but finally she had to accept everything except\ntemple entry.\nAfter some days we struggled for that also. Even at that\ntime the queen did not accept. Finally when 400, 500 people\nbecame Muslims she got to her senses and made an order\nfor temple entry. Its echo is what is called temple entry\ntoday. The trend of today's temple entry is surprising. Still,\nthe philosophy of our agitation is certainly winning.\nSo, in such a situation, I have heard that the Depressed\nClasses do not have the right to enter the Brahmin streets in\n\n228\n\n\fyour village, Thirumangalam. In this year 1947, when the\ngovernment has made laws to abolish untouchability, if the\nAryans of this village are so firm and inhumane, to what can\nwe compare their caste arrogance?\nThe agitations by the Self-Respect and Dravidian\nMovement have completely eradicated the barriers of caste\ndifferences in hotels. It must be the duty of the people who\nare bothered about the welfare of the nation to eradicate the\ncruelties practiced in such villages on the Depressed Classes\nby (those who are called) Aryans and upper caste.\nIf such atrocities take place anywhere, please bring it to\nthe attention of the Dravidian Movement. We tell all this in\na conference and bring it to the politician's notice and make\nthem pass orders.\nIf only the indifferent attitude of the politicians is going\nto be the answer, we will attain human rights by\ntransgressing even their 144 ban.\nI say in brief, whoever enslaves the Depressed Classes,\nthe Dravidian Movement will fight against it. Panchayat\nmembers in every village must take concern and give us\nsupport in this task.\n[Viduthalai, 5-7-1947]\nDepressed Classes and the Dravidian Movement\nThe Depressed Class comrade S.S.Mani, who gave funds to\nme on behalf of the Dravidar Kazhagam of this village, said\nthat I have worked more for the Depressed Classes. He also\nsaid that all the Depressed Classes members of this village\nhave resolved to work for the Dravidian Movement.\nI, or the Dravidian Movement, have not worked\nseparately for the Depressed Classes. If you want, say that\nthe schemes of the Dravidian Movement try to secure the\nrights of those who are the Depressed Classes. I cannot lie\nto you that I am working separately for the Depressed\nClasses. I do not have such an idea. There is no necessity\nfor it to be there. Why do I say so? You need not consider it\nin another way. We cannot accept the difference of Adi\n\n229\n\n\fDravidar and Dravida. Our scheme is that all are\nDravidians.\nThe Dravidians are not without upper caste people who\nhave caste arrogance. From now onwards, I know how to\nrectify them. So, it is my intense feeling that we, who are of\none race, should not have divisions among us even at the\nlevel of words.\nI will explain in detail. The important doctrine of the\nDravidian movement is that there should be no Paraiyan,\nBrahmin, upper caste, lower caste, and that the existence of\nSudra and Panchama (identities) must be totally destroyed.\nAll are of one race, all are people of the same society: this\ndoctrine must be implemented. So there is no need to\nunnecessarily boast that the Dravidar Kazhagam or I did\nthis for the castes among us.\nThe Aryans and their Congress establishment can say\nso, cheat and feel proud about it. Because they belong to\nanother race, they are of another country. They enslave us in\nthe name of God, they ensure that we do not have a living in\nour country, because they live here like termites. As if it is\ndoing charity, that group says, \"we did this and that for the\nAdi Dravidars,\" and they try to hide the conspiracy of\ndomination. Why should our Dravidian Movement also get\ndown to such a low level? So comrades we do not need\ndifferences of Adi Dravidar and Dravidar within us. Make\nthem attain the sentiment. Do not say Paraiyan, do not say\nSudra.\nAlso, my dear friend and intellectual Dr.Ambedkar is\nthe leader of the Scheduled Caste Federation. With great\nevidence he said that the Depressed Classes are not Hindus.\nHe is one of the important people who reduced the Aryan\narrogance. Great intellectual. I had great expectations of his\ncooperation to destroy the cruelties of this Aryanism. That\nAryanism whose main root he shook-the same Aryanism\nestablishment-the Congress establishment-of the Hindus\nhas today controlled Ambedkar. Even he has a relationship\nwith the Congress. If it has to be mentioned, my mind is\nsaddened on seeing him speak the dry north-Indian concept\n\n230\n\n\fthat India should not be partitioned. I fear that in some more\ndays he will oppose the partition of Dravidar Nadu.\nStill, it looks like in his situation in the north-Indian\nconnection, may be that is how he needs to be. I am not\ncoming forward to say something wrong or complain about\nit. If those who call themselves the leaders of the Depressed\nClasses in our country, unnecessarily blame the Dravidian\nmovement-whose only aim is the liberation of the\nDepressed Classes-its policies, and me; can we blame\nDr.Ambedkar who is attached to the north?\nI wish to say one thing whether they blame or don't\nblame the Dravidian Movement or me. Comrades! I give the\nguarantee that till its last breath, the Dravidar Kazhagam\nshall work for annihilating the low caste titles of Pallan and\nParaiyan and for their development. Till now, I have not\nsaid that you should not join the Scheduled Caste\nFederation. You attain the benefits coming out of that. The\nDepressed Class comrades have the right to enjoy the\nbenefits of the Dravidar Kazhagam's labour, whether they\njoin it or not.\nFinally, one thing is certain. During the struggle for the\npartition of the Dravidar Nadu people like Dr.Ambedkar\nmight even oppose it, but I have the definite belief that the\nindigenous people will remain with me and the Dravidian\nmovement and work. The indigenous people and the\nDravidian movement (or the Self-Respect movement) are\nlike nail and flesh and nobody can separate them. So,\nmajority of the benefit of Dravidar Nadu is only for the\nindigenous people. If not today, at least in the future, those\nwho oppose it will understand.\n[Viduthalai, 8-7-1947]\nHinduism and Untouchability\nWe often write about the pathetic state of those who are\ncalled Untouchables in the \"Hindu religion.\" Today in our\ncountry, the people of the Depressed Classes having\nrealized their disgraceful state have started to agitate against\nbeing treated as Untouchables, unsociables and being\n\n231\n\n\foppressed by the \"Indian\" people, because they want to\nrescue themselves.\nRecently in Poona, a Satyagraha took place for temple\nentry. Its vigor has not yet decreased. It has aroused the\nfeelings of people in that region. In north India, in several\nplaces like Varanasi, increased signs of rebellion by the\nDepressed Classes can be observed. In south India,\nparticularly in our Tamil Nadu, within a few years of the\nspread of Self-Respect Movement, the public have been\nconcerned about the issues of the Depressed Classes. They\nhave also got the courage that can make them escape the\ndisgraceful situation.\nThose who are called the Saivas and those who are\ncalled the Vaishnavas have realized well that they cannot\nescape by merely showing the stories of Nandanar and\nThirupaanalwar. Moreover, Adi Dravidars and the other\nDepressed Classes are also calling for conferences of their\nown communities and working for the development of their\nsociety. We also learn that day by day the agitations or\nemotions related to temple entry are increasing in places\nlike Chidambaram, Erode, Villupuram and Tiruchi in Tamil\nNadu.\nWe also come to know that in the Travancore\nSamasthanam (Kingdom), lakhs of 'Ezhavars' and\n'Pulayans' who are ostracized as Untouchables are\nindulging very vehemently in demonstrations related to\ntemple entry. Though it might be another matter that it is\nnot possible for their agitations to be successful. Those who\nclosely observe the philosophy of their efforts cannot deny\nthat the time to determine the end of Hindu religion is\ndrawing near.\nWe have often expressed our opinion about temple\nentry. It is not that if the 'Untouchables' enter the temple\nthey will immediately get salvation or the grace of God. But\n'Hinduism' says that our God resides in the temple. We also\nsee people saying that God will die if the Untouchables\nenter the temple, or get close to God's statue. We will say\nthat this temple entry movement has been started to prove to\nthe Brahmins, the Saivaites, and the Vaishnavaites, that it is\n\n232\n\n\fbetter for these Gods of fragile life to die and to be\ndestroyed than for them to exist.\nMore than the other public places, the temples are given\nimportance. We think that we need to express at this time\nthe truth behind this reason.\nWe accept that the Depressed Classes attempt to enter\nthe temple not because of the devotion they have over God.\nSince they have enough Gods and brokers and priests in\ntheir own community to enslave them and to prevent their\nrationalism from being used, they have no necessity for our\nGods.\nThe depressed classes and those who are called Sudras\nfollow different ceremonies of marriage. Those who are\n'Sudras' are vehement that they should make Brahmins\nconduct their marriages. This is very shameful.\nIn the name of law, Sastras, gods, they are ostracizing\nus as Paraiyan, Panchama, and Sudra; should those who\nhave intelligence not boycott them? We must realize that\nbecause we are Hindus we have all these ills. Only when we\nbecome conscious that we are Dravidians these ills run\naway from us. Muslims do not have the capacity of\nleniency. Like the Hindu, even the Christian priest is\nunconcerned about the existence of Christian Paraiyan,\nChristian Brahmin and Christian Mudaliar. But among the\nMuslims, there is no Muslim Brahmin, Muslim Paraiyan.\nLike that we should also be one (uniform) Dravidians.\nWe must not keep Hindu names. Hindu garbs and\nreligious identities are against us. Has any of the Alwars,\nNayanmars, avatars of the Gods, and the Mahatma at least\nsaid that the disgraceful titles of Sudra, prostitute-son,\nParaiyan, Panchaman must be abolished? Only the Selfrespect movement and the Dravidar Kazhagam are doing\nthat work.\nIf the Brahmin touches shit, he just washes his hand. If\nhe touches a Panchama, he says that a bath is essential.\nThat madman thinks that if the temple is open, this\nmadman will believe. Such cheating will not take place any\nlonger. Because of temple entry, the Panchama and the\n\n233\n\n\fSudra might have become one. But, the Brahmin has not yet\nlet go. We still don't have share in the money he gets\nthrough the hundi (temple money/ charity). Unable to bear\nthe atrocities several people of the Depressed classes are\nbecoming Muslims. These Brahmin newspapers are\nblacking out the news.\nWe need to realize by ourselves. If anyone asks, \"Why\nthis black shirt?\" then we need to answer, \"I am of a\ndisgraceful caste. I have the stinking job of working with\nleather. The Brahmin has the job of police superintendent. It\nseems I am a Paraiyan. The lazy Brahmin who does not\nwork is a higher caste. I feel sad for this. I get angry. In\norder to remind myself of, and in order to retrieve myself\nfrom, this disgraceful position I am wearing this black\nshirt.\"\nI cannot remain peaceful if someone just says that\nPeriyar should live long. Our disgrace must be completely\nremoved. Only that day I will be peaceful. In order for our\ndisgrace to be eradicated, we need to give our lives for a\nrevolution.\n[Viduthalai, 23-7-1947]\nDravidar Kazhagam\nAmong the duties of this Kazhagam, the important one is to\nremove the disgraceful position of Sudra and Panchama that\nthe Dravidian people have on account of their birth and to\ngive them an equal, high status. Otherwise, the Dravidar\nKazhagam is not opposed to other organizations.\nThe socialists say that we need economic equality. We\nsay that it is not enough and that we also need social\nequality.\nI ask the Dravidian comrades in the Congress to pay\ngood attention. As long as the British were there, you kept\nsaying that first the British should go only then you will\nlook into the internal affairs of this country. Now, the\nBritish have gone. You can announce, \"Now, the disgrace\nhas gone away.\" You can announce, \"There is no Brahmin,\nno Sudra, no Panchama.\" They can tom-tom, \"Freedom has\n\n234\n\n\fcome. From now, no difference, no divisions, all are equal.\"\nWhy have you not done so? Why was it not possible to do\nso? Think a bit.\nWho is responsible for this disgraceful situation: for\nonly 15% of our people are educated, and 100% of the\nBrahmins are literate? Who is responsible for our being the\nfourth and fifth caste? It is only 200 years since the British\ncame. It is only 700 years since the Muslims came. But our\ndisgrace has been there for 2000, 3000 years. So, the British\nand the Muslims are not responsible for our disgraceful\nsituation. That is why even after the British left, the disgrace\ndid not go. Is this not clear?\nThen who is responsible? The Aryans came 5000 years\nago in search of pasture to graze their cattle; they came to\nbeg like nomads. These Aryans started Hinduism and\ndivided the people into four castes and effortlessly made\nothers work for them. Are not the Aryans, who enslaved\npeople in the name of God and religion, responsible for\nthis?\nThey made a law that \"Jobs must be given on the basis\nof merit and qualification. Depressed Classes do not have\nthe right of communal representation\"-the freedom was\nused only for this. There are no primary schools for the\nchildren of our indigenous people to study. In many places,\ncolleges are being built for the education of the children of\nthe upper castes and the rich.\nThey get scholarships of one lakh and ten lakhs and\nthey study and they go to work. Our people have to graze\ncows in the village, they need to draw the pankha, or they\nhave to wear pavadai, take care of children and simply put\nsalaams. We need to work under them; this is the\neducational system of the Congress.\nIf we kill each other, the Brahmin counts how many of\nus will pay for the thivasam rituals. He will only laugh that\nthe Sudras are killing each other. What else will he do?\nEven the words, \"Oh it is pathetic!\" does not exist in his\ndictionary.\n\n235\n\n\fIf we observe, is it not because of our propaganda that a\nfew of the Dravidian comrades in the Congress enjoy\npositions and are in charge of posts? So comrades! The\ndisgrace on account of birth must go away from society.\nOur party must work for that. The domination by the northIndians in politics must be destroyed. It is our political\nscheme the Dravidian must have a separate government.\nTill both of these are completely fulfilled, the Dravidar\nKazhagam shall continue to work fearlessly. For that we\nwill plead and get the support of anybody and work without\nany desire for position. So comrades! If you think what I\nhave been saying so long is right, join the Dravidar\nKazhagam. As a symbol of that, wear the black shirt. Fly a\nblack flag in your homes. Work for the Dravidian people.\n[Viduthalai, 20-8-1947]\nBrahmin domination\nWe need to give rice and pulses to be offered to God. But\nwhen God eats, we should not see. We build temples. The\nconsecration ceremony is done at our cost. But if we touch\nit, God will die. To do the purificatory rites, we need to give\nmoney to the Brahmins. So, he himself should do the\nprayers. He will take all the money that comes to his plate.\nWith that his son should study B.A. Is this just?\nNot only do we struggle to give, but also we are\ndisgracefully called Sudras, Panchamas and we starve. The\nBrahmin who eats without toiling and calls himself a high\ncaste is allotting seats for our salvation. Is this justified? His\nwife will wear an 18-cubit sari and will walk happily like a\nsoldier. Our wives wear a four-cubit sari tightly that leaves\nthem half covered, half naked and they bend and walk. Is\nthis fair? With the money we give, he gambles or drinks or\neducates his daughter. Without money for education, our\nson grazes the buffalo. With the milk, curd, butter, we fill\nthe Brahmin's stomach. Is this fair? Have we not come to\nthis low state by not using our own intelligence and having\nbelieved everything that the Brahmin said was Hinduism.\nOnly to permanently establish this they have made\nnationalism and Swaraj.\n\n236\n\n\fSo, you must awake! There must be no place for the\nBrahmin in this country. There is no place for the Sudra.\nThere is no place for the Panchama. Like other countries\nthere will be space only for people, only for people who live\nin accordance with discipline/ order, justice and\nintelligence. We must create this situation. We are working\nonly for that.\n[Viduthalai, 22-8-1947]\nDravidar Kazhagam\nThe Dravidar Kazhagam in not a political party; it is a party\nrelated to society. From the beginning, I have said that\npolitics in only a part of the social setup. Others say that\nonly politics is important and that if power is captured\nsocial reforms can be made in one line. We will understand\nwhat is more important by seeing the plans that the present\npoliticians have made in order to prevent our social\ndevelopment. This is because the public has not understood\nthat the right of social equality is important. Our important\nwork is to create humanism.\nIf we create unity in society and obtain the support of\npeople, whoever is in power, we can treat them as we like.\nIn this situation if we have power in our hands, it will be\nsufficient just to tackle the opposition and remain in power.\nHowever hard they work, will people of integrity, honesty,\nand with feelings of society get position in politics?\nDr.Ambedkar himself was unable to secure a position\ndespite his feelings for his community. Will it be possible\nfor others? Who benefits in the present independence,\nexcept the gang with its separate ideology? The traitors of\nother parties will benefit.\nComrades, think over this! Was our lowness removed\nbecause of the freedom movement? Was the lowness/\ndisgrace removed because the Dravidians captured power?\nBecause it has been secured firmly with nails, more than\ngaining power, or betraying our ideology and falling in the\nenemy's feet to gain power, we need to make the public\naccessible to us, pressurize those in power and make them\n\n237\n\n\fwork for us-we need to work towards this. We need\nstronger, consistent propaganda for that. More than the\nbelief I have in power, I have greater belief in pressurizing\nthose in power. Changing the mind of the public is essential\nand it is possible through propaganda.\nLet us take Muslims and Christians. They are\nconsidered as Mlechas according to the Hindu religion. That\nis, they are lower than us. It seems they are lower than the\nSudras and the Panchamas. What did they do that we didn't\ndo? What do they eat that we don't eat? Are they not\nDravidians who converted their religion, being unable to\nbear the title of Sudras and Panchamas? They were made\ninto Mlechas only because they were Dravidians. So\ncomrades, Muslims and Christians are only of our race.\nThey did not come from Arabia or Gujarat. They are not\nalso low. The Aryans who said to us that they (Muslims and\nChristians) are low and made us hate them are the Mlechas.\nThey have written a dictionary that Aryans are Mlechas\n(foreigners). We have started work that no one has started\nbefore. We have touched a place which any great man, any\navatar of God, any Alwar, any Nayanmar, any Acharya, any\nfighter who went to the gallows was afraid to touch.\nThough it was also considered to be essential till now,\nwe started this work of social reform, of destruction of\nvarnashrama dharma, in the name of self-respect, in the\nname of feeling of community. After several difficulties and\nworries, only now the seed of self-respect that we planted\nhas started to take root. When it is just a plant, instead of\neveryone breaking a twig for a toothpick and letting it be\nspoilt, everyone who passes by it should pour a jug of\nwater, only then it will become a tree and give fruit. Reform\nwill take root.\nI pray that comrades who doubt if we love\nindependence must think a little. 25, 30 years ago, I also\nrolled a little in the slush of independence, the slush of\nfreedom in the belief that if freedom comes, disgraces will\neasily go away.\nI immediately came out when I observed that the\nmethods to establish varnashrama were expertly handled,\n\n238\n\n\fand I started the Self Respect Movement, a social reform\nmovement. Children and youth must understand this well. I\nwill repeatedly say that all this speech of independence is\nonly to make way for Aryan imperialism to be rampant.\nThis is not to say that our work will attain success in\nour own period. This is what we need to do till we live, then\nleave the rest of the work to the following generations. Only\nif we work like that we will not get tired. In order to have\nchildren, a few women circumambulate the peepul tree and\nthen touch their lower abdomen (expecting children). That\nis our state too.\nWhat great change have we created among the people?\nHow many people have we made to think, \"I am not a\nHindu, I am not a Sudra\"? So, I request our comrades that\nwe need to work without the desire for positions, without\ngetting tired, with honesty, commitment and firmness of\nmind for the cause we have taken up.\n[Viduthalai, 05-09-1947]\nManusmriti and Caste System\nThere are several evidences to prove that Dravidians are\ncalled Sudras in the name of Hinduism. In the 10th Chapter\nof Manu Smriti, under the title 'Sakar Jati' it is said that\nthose who do not follow the dharma of caste are known as\nDravidians. It is mentioned that the children born to a Sudra\nman and a Brahmin women are Chandalas. A child born to a\nBrahmin and a Sudra is the degraded fisherman caste.\nFurther it is mentioned therein that those born through\nnot following the caste dharma in the Aryan nation are the\nChakkiliyars (who work with the skin and hide of animals)\nand Paraiyars who wear the clothes of the dead and eat the\nremaining food. Further, in the 44th sloka in the 10th chapter\nit is mentioned that the rulers of the Dravidian nation are\nSudras. The language they speak is called a low language\nand they are termed as low caste people.\nJust like Dravidians, the term Andhra is also mentioned.\nAn Andhra is one who hunts animals in the forest and sells\nthem (10th canto, 48th sloka). So, the Dravidians and\n\n239\n\n\fAndhras are low caste people who are Untouchables. This is\nclearly mentioned in the Laws of Manu.\nFurther these people should live unseen, away from the\ncity, under the trees or near the graveyards and tend dogs\nand donkeys and should not own cattle. This is mentioned\nin the 50th Sloka.\nThese people should dress themselves only in the\nclothes worn by the corpses, eat in broken vessels, should\nnot use any form of metal vessels, should wear jewels only\nmade of iron and brass. For their livelihood they should\nalways roam. While auspicious functions are taking place\nthey should not be seen and one should not talk with them.\nThey should be forced to marry within their castes. They\nshould not be given anything directly. The remaining food\nmust be put in a broken vessel. They should not come into\nthe village in the nights. Even if they are dressed well they\nshould be considered only as degraded people.\nGandhi said in his speech in Tirupur in Tamil Nadu,\nwhat is the way for liberation for a Sudra female child? She\nmust marry a Brahmin man, and her daughter must marry a\nBrahmin likewise, if the same procedure is carried out for\nseven generations then in the seventh generation he/she\nbecomes a person of Brahmin community.\nA Sudra by doing the work of a Brahmin does not\nbecome a Brahmin; likewise a Brahmin by performing any\nmenial work of the Sudras never becomes a Sudra. A\nBrahmin never becomes a Sudra and a Sudra never becomes\na Brahmin (Canto 10 Sloka 73)\nA Brahmin should never do the work of ploughing. He\ncan do that job by using some others. Because he thinks that\nby ploughing, the iron end inflicts the mother earth. (Canto\n10 Sloka 84)\nIf a low caste man does the work of a higher caste man,\nthen the king should chase him out of the nation after taking\nall his belongings (Canto 10 Sloka 96).\nThe Sudra has no right to perform rituals. (Canto 10\nSloka 126).\n\n240\n\n\fA Sudra should not earn more even if he is talented,\nbecause his property would cause pain to a Brahmin. (Canto\n10 Sloka 129).\nA Brahmin has the right to plunder the properties\nearned by a Sudra (Canto 11 Sloka 13).\nThe term Asura means only the Sudras, this has\nevidence in the 20th Sloka of 11th canto.\nIt is mentioned that it is proper and virtuous to usurp the\nproperty of persons who do not perform yagnas. If the Laws\nof Manu becomes the Hindu dharma and Dravidians\nbecome Hindus what will be the plight of the Dravidians?\n[Kudiarasu, 20-9-1947]\nDepressed Classes\nNo one will consider a society to be a developed society if\nthere are Depressed Classes in it. If the majority in a society\nare Depressed Classes, it is really a great harm to that\nsociety.\nIf I or the members of the Dravidar Kazhagam are being\ncriticized today by Aryanism it is not because we are\nblaming God. It is not because we question, \"Why does God\nneed temples, prayers and prostitutes?\" But because we ask,\n\"Why are we Sudras? Why are our mothers Sudra women?\nWhy are our comrades Chandalas? Why are you alone\nBrahmins?\"\nIt is because we question the varnashrama dharma.\nWhat can we say if you also criticize us for being atheists\nwithout understanding this? We can only say that the\nBrahmins have created real Sudras among us to such an\nextent and made us into a shameless society.\nHow much ever belief we have in God and religion, if\nsomeone has shame, will he dedicate his daughter, or his\nsister to the God and leave her for the service of the village?\nHas any Brahmin let his daughter to be become a prostitute\nand dance the Sadir in front of God? Has any Brahmin\nmade you sit on the palanquin and carried you? Has any\nBrahmin used you as a priest and performed a ritual? When\nhe has disgraced you so much, when he still continues to\n\n241\n\n\fdisgrace you, if you have any shame will you make your\nintelligence subservient to him and see him take you for a\nride? This is what we ask.\nGo to the temple if you like. We are not asking you not\nto go there. In the height of ecstatic bhakti, dance in joy. We\nare not preventing you from that. But why do you bow your\nheads to that dirty Brahmin? Why do you become a slave to\nhis language? This is what we ask you. Is this atheism?\nIf the sages and mahatmas of those days need to be rid,\nthen, are the sages and mahatmas of today any better?\nWould they have said one word that this varnashrama\ndharma must be destroyed? This Rajagopalachari? Leave\nthem; would this Munusamy Pillai or Sivashanmugam Pillai\nask why there must be Panchamas? If they had spoken one\nword against the Varnashrama Dharma they could not have\nreached to the position where they are today. What about\ntoday? Even if they say one word in opposition, the same\nday the Aryan gang will start blaming them! What\nhappened to those who opposed them?\nI will say what happened to those who supported them,\nlisten.\nDo you know of Kabilar who opposed Aryanism? How\nmany of you know Thiruvalluvar who said that all beings\nare the same in birth? How many of you have the read\nKabilar's ahaval or Thiruvalluvar's kural? Do you know of\nOvvai who said that there are only two castes (women and\nmen) and thus opposed the four-fold caste system?\nOn the contrary, even the cowherd in your home knows\nabout Raman or Krishnan who supported Aryanism and\nhighly respected the beggar Brahmins. Your prayer book is\nthe Gita of the thief Krishna, the Gita of the immoral\nKrishna, the Gita of the Krishna who said that \"I only\ncreated the Sudra, there are four castes.\" He is your god of\nthe Kali Yuga. According to you, not only were the graceful\nKabilan and the godly bard Thiruvalluvan and the artist\nOvvai, born in the womb of a Paraiyan woman; you don't\neven know their songs.\n\n242\n\n\fIt seems Thiruvalluvar, Kabilar, Ovvai, were born to a\nSudra woman called Aadhi and a Brahmin called Bhagwan.\nTholkappiyan whom you praise was born to the Aryan.\nWhen they are working so hard to see that all the greatness\ncomes only to the people of their community, and even on\nseeing that if you continue to be their tails, how can others\nconsider you to have some shame? Comrades if you have\nshame, please cooperate with us in order to gain human\nstatus. Otherwise, at least stay apart. Don't become the\nhenchmen of Aryanism: Vibhishanas and Hanumans.\nThe uncivilized barbaric Negroes don't have the\ndifference of Brahmin and Sudras. The Eskimos, who eat\npeople raw and live amidst the dark snow, do not have these\ndifferences of high and low.\nDear friend who calls himself the son of Bharat Mata!\nThe warrior who hails Bharat Mata! How can children of\nfour-five castes have been born to your Bharat Mata? If it is\nso, do the children of Bharat Mata have four fathers? How\ncan it be of one caste? Will you accept this? Why all this\ncheating: that one mother must have children of four castes?\nWhy do you shamelessly try to boss over us?\nWhat labels you Sudras? Only Hindu religion has made\nyou into Sudras. Only because you call yourself a Hindu,\nyou need to comply with the varnashrama dharma. You are\nmade a Sudra only because you accept the gods of\nHinduism. Brother, only because you go to worship these\ngods, you need to stand outside the prayer room, bow and\nkeep beating your cheeks.\nYou think of the foolish, sly story! It seems Brahma\ncreated you! It seems the Brahmin was created from the\nface of the Brahma. It seems the Kshatriya came out of the\nshoulders of Brahma and the Vaishya was born out of\nBrahma's hips. Only because you were born out of his legs\nyou are the Sudra. When Brahma has a wife, why should\nthe husband do this work? Is it possible? Is Brahma male or\nfemale?\nEven if that is ignored, why have they created it in such\na way that one can give birth in several places? It seems that\nKrishna says in the Gita that it was he who created the four\n243\n\n\fcastes. If all the four were born of Brahma, then why does\nthe Brahmin alone be called the son of Brahma, the race of\nBrahman? Because they were born in the lower organs, are\nthey lower-caste? The jackfruit tree bears fruit even in its\nroots. It also bears fruit in the top. Is there difference in\nquality and taste? Is there no limit to foolishness and\natrociousness? We who build temples and give away\nwealth, why should we be made into those born from the\nfeet of god? The Brahmin who has never known labour, has\nnever given even one coin for the god, cheats the God and\nalso fattens himself with what we give this God; why\nshould he be made the one who came out of the face of\nGod? Can a god who did this or allowed this to be done, be\nour god? Can a god who says that his life will go if he touch\nhim, be our God?\nToday my friend of the Vannar caste, and friend of the\nChakkili caste can send a telegram and talk on the phone.\nThey can also today board an airplane and fly over your\nheads and the heads of your gods and the cupolas of your\ntemples at the speed of thousand miles per hour. When they\nhave been given the right to enjoy all this, why should the\ndirt-laden Brahmin alone have the right to touch this\nimmobile stone God?\nOnly our people were the origin for all these\nspecialties-for bravery, courage, energy, intelligence,\nmanliness, affection and beauty. At what point of time were\nwe, their descendants, made into Sudras? Who made us\nSudras? Aryans, or the Gods?\nOnly after the Aryans migrated to this land could they\nhave bullied us and called us children of prostitutes. Only\nafter that we became Sudras. If we were Sudras before that,\nwould our Gods have called us children of prostitutes? If it\nhad been so, would we have accepted it as such? Three\nthousand years ago, from somewhere in middle Asia, the\nAryan tribals were a begging crowd that came here in\nsearch of pasture to graze their cattle. For having hated\ntheir sacrifices and soma bhan (ambrosial liquor) they\ncalled our ancestors as children of prostitutes and Sudras.\n\n244\n\n\fIn this age of rationalism and science, because we\naccept it without shame and remain their slaves, they are\nstill ruling over us. You also remain dumb and not question\nthem. Till now who thought about this disgrace? Because I\nhave recruited several people and I do the work of removing\nthis disgrace, some people have realized this disgrace and\nhave joined me.\nSeeing this, the Aryan gang feels that its influence is\ncoming down and it begins to debase me. My friend, should\nyou join with them and start shouting? For him (the Aryan),\nthere is a loss of income, his superiority goes away and in\nthat sadness he shrivels his mouth and blabbers. If we say\nhis faults, why should you, a Dravidian, get angry? Why do\nyou worry? If you are worried, go and tell him what is fair\nand make him mend his ways. Instead of doing that, why do\nyou take my life?\nDo I struggle for myself? I work for you and your\nfamily and your descendants too, that the Sudra title should\ngo away. If I blame the Hindu religion that speaks of caste\ndifference and Sastras and puranas that serve as the basis\nand the Gods who accept these, why do you get angry,\nbrother (the Dravidian comrade of the Congress)? If I feel\nashamed because they call me a Sudra, I list out the faults in\nthem. If you do not have shame, if they say you are the son\nof a prostitute, and if you accept it, you can stand apart in a\ncorner.\nIf you say that one should not talk about religion, does\nit mean that god is the private property of your home? The\ngod who is omnipresent, will he not be present for me? Can\nhe allow a group to dishonestly exploit him for the sake of\ntheir livelihood? Why do you jump at me if I speak against\nthose who loot us in the name of God? Why should we\naccept a god who says that we are Sudras? By saying that\nwe are all Hindus, why must the Brahmin make me alone\ndonate rice and pulses? Brother, you answer that first.\nI will say that it is barbaric to believe in such a God.\nHinduism is a great deception. The Vedas and Sastras of\nHinduism is all number one cheating. The puranas is a slush\nin which a jealous work is going to creep. Salvation and hell\n\n245\n\n\fare all conjurors' tricks. Sin and virtue are for those without\nintegrity. All this cannot approach a self-respecting man of\nintegrity. Even if they approach, they will be exposed and it\ncannot destroy him. Can you contradict this? Who first\ncondemned the devadasi system? Only the Self-Respecters.\nBrother, do you know how much of opposition was created\nin those days? Instead of being afraid of all that opposition,\nwe fearlessly agitated. That is why this group of believers\nhas itself passed a law that the devadasi system must be\nabolished. Like this how much we started-today, how they\nare being fulfilled? Think over this. The Hindu religion and\nthe Varnashrama Dharma are responsible for your being\nSudras. Only the Self-respecters touched the basis of it, and\nsaid that the religion of Varnashrama itself must be\nabolished. Your Alwars, Nayanmars, Sankara or Ramanuja\nor the heads of the mutts or the pundits did not say this. All\nof them said that a reformed Hindu religion was needed.\nIf the Brahmins in our country are not sectarian, why do\nthey have a separate Hindu Mahasabha, and apart from that\na Brahmin Protection Association and a Hindi Prachar\n(Sanskrit Prachar) Sabha?\n[Viduthalai, 23-12-1947]\nSwaraj and caste\nDoes Swaraj imply that a Brahmin should rule a Paraiyar? If\na cat rules a rat will it be Swaraj? If a Zamindar rules a\nfarmer can it be Swaraj? If a proprietor rules a labourer can\nthis be called Swaraj?\n\"I am a Sudra (a prostitute's son) according to the\nAryan's dictionary. My friend is an untouchable (he is a\nPanchama and Chandala). My Muslim friend is Mlecha,\nanother a Brahmin.\" Keeping all these people in mind we\ntalk about democracy without any shame or honour. If you\nhave some honour or intellect, first declare that all are equal\nin this nation and there is no place for distinction according\nto caste. Give the voting right to everybody and then declare\ndemocracy.\n\"Swaraj\" which stealthily came from behind the\nscreens at midnight by seeking an auspicious day has not\n\n246\n\n\fentered the scabbard like a sword till today. The robbery,\nmurder, rape that started that day has not stopped. Only\nenmity is growing rapidly and there are no institutions that\nreduce these problems. Why should a Hindu and a Muslim\nexist? Why should an owner and a labourer exist? Did\nanyone question why a Brahmin and a Paraiyar, a superior\nand an inferior should exist? If they do not have a difference\nof feeling will there ever be any quarrel and dispute?\nFreedom fighters! Have you ever made the public\nrealize about humanity? Have you changed your policy as\nper the interest of the people depending on the times and\nexisting circumstances and on the people's natural feelings\nof usual worldly desires? As long as such differences exist\namong people, humanity will continue to seethe. Realize\nthis and act accordingly. To achieve permanent peace, begin\nby removing all the differences and do the necessary.\n[Viduthalai, 19-1-1948]\nLabourers\nOne should realize that according to the Hindu religion, all\nDravidians are Sudras only because of their occupation.\nThese labourers are considered as low, degraded people\nonly due to Hinduism and Varnashrama Dharma. It is plain\nignorance to think that one is a low caste person because he\ndoes menial jobs.\nIn no other nation is a particular job assigned to a group\nof people, and another type of job to a different group of\npeople. So in other countries there is no stigma associated\nwith occupation or labour. So no occupation has fame or\nshame in other countries.\nThe profession of making shoes and slippers is assigned\nto one sect of people and in particular it is assigned to the\nPanchamas i.e., Untouchables or outcastes. Only in our\ncountry, this profession is considered as a low one but by no\nmeans is that profession a low profession. On the contrary\nthe profession of archaka (temple priest) that is carried out\nmainly by Brahmins is considered by the Hindu religion as\na position of fame and it is assigned only to a high caste\nBrahmin.\n\n247\n\n\fThus, one cannot be a high or low caste because of\noccupation. This realization should come to the labourers.\nOnly labourers should rebel, revolt and fight against the\nsituation. Why should they physically labour in order to\nlive, and based on that be made as low caste? These days\nlabourers only fight for better pay not realizing that better\npay (or increase in pay) leads to increase in the cost of\ncommodities.\nFurther these labourers are mad about religion, God,\npast sins, blessings and destiny. So, only the Brahmin leads\na life of laziness without toil and rolls over with good food\nand a lot of money. On the contrary, the poor labourer\nbelieves in destiny, labours the whole day saying it is\n\"god's will\" and is not able to eat even a square meal a day.\nThe Brahmin lives in arrogance saying that god has blessed\nhim and lives on the labour of others. The labourers toil\nwithout cunningness and lead a life of poverty. Thus these\nselfish and cunning Brahmins have made (religious) laws to\nlead a life of comfort at the expense of other's labour. Do\nthese have any rhyme or reason? That is why I question,\n\"Can gods will or law, exist for Brahmins leading a lazy life\nand non-Brahmins toiling without any comfort?\" So god\nshould first ensure that the person who labours the whole\nday is well paid and the lazy Brahmin can be fed meagerly\nwith the remainders.\nToday's nationalist comrades and communist comrades\nsing the national anthem \"to destroy the world that cannot\nprovide food for an individual.\"\nThe Brahmin (Subramania) Bharati showed this way.\nHow are they going to destroy the world? Is it by cutting the\nocean into the land? Or by putting the sun into their oven? If\nthey are going to destroy the world will not the labourer\nalso get destroyed? What a foolish thing!\n[Viduthalai, 20-1-1948]\nSudras and Brahmins\nThe class of people who were Sudras about 2000 years ago\ncontinues to remain Sudras even now. Those who were\n\n248\n\n\fBrahmins 2000 years ago, continue to be Brahmins even\nnow. Our colours, habits, love and hate and our behaviour\nhave changed but our caste that is birth-based alone remains\nthe same. Is this proper? Is it all right? Now, we cannot\naccept the disgrace. Of what use is a religion that does not\ngive place for our respect! When we assemble like this, our\nmind and concern should be only about our self-respect.\nHow will disgrace go?\n[Viduthalai, 29-2-1948]\nSwaraj\nI was very clear that in the Swaraj, Panchamas and Sudras\nshould be only one sect of people. Only for that I wore the\nblack shirt.\n[Viduthalai, 11-3-1948]\nIndependence\nWe thought that after we get independence we would\nbecome free from the stigma of birth. But after\nindependence we have lost the freedom of even talking\nabout the stigma of birth. For saying so I am going to be\nimprisoned!\nWhat is the meaning of this? So lowness can exist!\nSudra can exist! But we should not talk about the troubles\ncreated by it. What does this mean? Western countries have\nmade plans! How much are we going to become developed\nin 50 years? We assess how we were in 1900, 1800, 1700\nand 1600? What was our status then? What should we do?\nWe carry out these sorts of plans! We go back to the days of\nEmperor Ashoka! What is our relation with Ashoka?\nWhen other nations are planning for national\ndevelopment, our nation is planning regressively. We are\nliving in a pathetic condition. They are playing on the\nignorance of the common man! Should we not begin to\nthink? In the name of ancient civilization they are dragging\nus to the olden days. Should not the intelligent people think\nabout this? Should not we struggle and toil to stop this?\nShould we not think carefully and worry about the cunning\n\n249\n\n\fand selfish motives by which we are treated and ruled? Be\nunited and toil hard to wipe out the stigma of low birth,\nwhich has no scientific reason or rhyme. Live like a single\nfamily. Learn unity from the Brahmins. The large crowds\nthat always gather to listen to my talks overwhelm me every\ntime.\n[Viduthalai, 11-3-1948]\nAryans and Dravidians\nThe Aryans call only the non-Aryans as Dravidians and say\nthat they are fit only for degraded work and that they are the\ndemons and rakshasas (devils) described in the Ramayana.\nEven the monkeys in Ramayana are nothing but the Sudras.\n(Jawaharlal) Nehru mentions this in a letter to his daughter.\nThat is, the lambadis (nomads) who came here seeking\ngreen pastures fought with us, enslaved us and when we\nagreed to work for them, they termed us Sudras and\nPanchamas. Those who were against them were termed as\nDemons, rakshasas and monkeys!\n[Kudiarasu, 8-5-1948]\nBrahmin domination\nThe domination and the cruelties practiced by the Aryans on\nthe natives are more than the problem faced by the natives\nunder the rule of the British or the Muslims or even in times\nof war!\nThese Brahmins who came as beggars into India made\nthe hooliganism grow. Should we also cultivate our people\nwith this hooliganism? We have more responsibilities\nbecause it is our nation and 97% are our people. That is why\nwe have to preach and teach to our people about morality,\nself-control and honesty. As the Brahmins have come to our\nnation for begging they have no feelings for our people or\nfor our nation. So you should not become angry with them.\nOnly the god who created the Brahmins has created me.\nWithout his permission, my mission is to annihilate the\nBrahmins and the Sudrahood. I campaign only for this. How\ncan I alone act against the rules of god? You go and ask\n\n250\n\n\fhim. Ask God who has created the Brahmins? Why did he\ncreate a Ramasamy to annihilate them?\nNearly 11\u20442 lakh people have gathered here. Will any\nBrahmin magazine write a line about this? Suppose a small\ncommotion or riot takes place, immediately all the Brahmin\nmagazines will report it saying that there was a big caste\nclash!\nWith so much restraint they hide the information about\nus. Suppose 33\u20444 Brahmins assemble in the Rasiga Ranjana\nSabha immediately all Brahmin magazines will write a page\nor more. Can anyone question these atrocities?\nDoing all these atrocities you (Brahmins) claim, \"The\nhand that holds the grass will hold the skies.\" What an\narrogance all of you have? Is it proper? When will you\ncome out in the open? How long shall we wait for you to\ncome out in the open? The sooner you come, the better for\nus. Our disrespect will be abolished sooner. We are 97%\nand you are 3% (of the population). Even if 3 of us are\ndestroyed we have 94% who can lead a life without stigma.\nIf all the 3% of you are destroyed there will be only 0% of\nyou.\nIf the grass-holders hold the sky, what will the beholder\nbe? If a finger becomes a grinding stone what will the\ngrinding stone become? What will be your plight? Think\nabout it!\nEveryday only Brahmins give problems to Dravidians\nbut Dravidians never give any problem to Brahmins-\neverybody should realize this. Brahmins are plantain leaves\nand Dravidians are plants with thorn. Whatever the fight is,\nonly the plantain leaves will be destroyed. If you try to clash\nwith us, you will be eradicated from the root. The Brahmins\nshould realize this. Brahmin comrades! Don't think we are\nfools and you are all intellectuals! Don't be destroyed due to\narrogance! You say that you treat everyone equally. Then,\nwhy do you keep tufts? How long can you rule us by\nkeeping some of us as your stooges? If they slowly come to\nour side what will be your plight? The black shirt that we\nwear is not for war; it is a symbol of disgrace. We feel\n\n251\n\n\fdisgraced due to disrespect, we feel sad. We have decided to\nwipe it off. That is what this black shirt indicates.\n[Viduthalai, 19-5-1948]\nNationalism\nThe word 'Desiyam' is a fraud since it is of Sanskrit origin.\nIt has introduced the Varnashrama Dharma in our great\ntraditional, honorable life. The Dravidians were made\nSudras and the ancient people of our country were made\nPanchamas; all these are conspiracies of the Brahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 20-7-1948]\nAnti-Hindi Agitation\nI feel that my demonstration should be ingrained in gold\nletters.\nOur demonstration is justifiable. People from all parties\nshould join this demonstration because it is for our selfrespect. This demonstration was against imposition of Hindi\nlanguage on us.\n[Viduthalai, 20-7-1948]\nSelf-Respect Movement\nAll demonstrations conducted by me and the Self-Respect\nMovement never faced defeat. We succeeded in entering\ntemples, taking water from common wells and so on.\n[Viduthalai, 22-8-1948]\nDravidians\nAll people, except the Aryans, are Dravidians. This includes\nMuslims and Christians also.\n[Viduthalai, 5-10-1948]\nReligious Untouchability\nIf a Brahmin claims himself to be a non-Brahmin, we have\nto first question, \"Where is the holy thread for a nonBrahmin?\" and tell him to first cut it. According to Arya\ndharma even the Muslims and Christians are considered\n\n252\n\n\fUntouchables. Break the stone gods that say there are\nUntouchables and use these stones to lay roads.\n[Viduthalai, 5-10-1948]\nMarriage\nMarriage rituals never existed among Dravidians. We see\nthat the marriage rituals for the dhobi (washermen) and the\nbarber are different. This itself is evidence that marriage\nrituals did not exist for Dravidians. Only the Aryans\nimposed all the marriage rituals on us.\nDear Dravidian comrades! If you want to be moral and\nhave human instinct you have to abandon love for Sastras,\npuranas, rituals, religion and gods because only they and\ntheir laws disrespect you and they were made by the Aryans\nto enslave you. Should we not leave all these useless\nactivities and start to work for reform? No one forces us to\nperform marriage in this form. If you want to improve\nyourself think and reason out with your intellect; if you\nwant to raise yourself, listen to me. Never blindly accept\nany act passed on by your ancestors.\n[Viduthalai, 24-10-1948]\nCongress and Caste\nThe leader of the Depressed Classes Dr. Ambedkar said that\nthe Congress is like a burning house and that soon it was\ngoing to be destroyed to ashes; hence he advised his friends\nnot to join it. He said this when he was holding position due\nto the Congress' favour. He said this mainly with concern\nfor people's development. He condemned the backwardness\nand tyrannical rule of the Congress and praised the Dravidar\nKazhagam which alone for acting against the oppression of\nCongress.\n[Viduthalai, 2-11-1948]\nBritish\nIn Britain, a man feels ashamed if he is not educated. In\nMadras city, only the British run hospitals for leprosy\npatients, orphanages, hospitals, and colleges and take care\n\n253\n\n\fof children abandoned at birth. They give education to the\nUntouchables who were not even permitted to walk in the\nstreets or come near others. The Untouchables are treated\nequally, and above all, with human dignity.\n[Kudiarasu, 28-5-1949]\nReligious discrimination\nNo god would be so dishonest as to treat the toiling class as\na low caste and the lazy caste that lives on other's labour as\nan upper caste.\n[Kudiarasu, 18-6-1949]\nAryan domination\nHow did the Aryans make us into slaves? Not by winning\nany war, but by their cunningness. They made myths and\nepics into art and stories and imposed it on us.\nSlowly, we accepted their philosophy, god and dharma.\nOnce they succeeded in that, they made the Laws of Manu\nthrough which we were made a low caste. Once they made\nus accept the Laws of Manu, they used the same law to\nmake us into a low caste people. When we realized this and\nprotest against it now, they impose their Aryan language on\nus. By these acts they are trying to ruin us.\n[Viduthalai, 16-1-1950]\nAryan domination\nThe Aryans became successful by imposing their culture on\nus. By destroying our culture they began to rule us. Because\nwe forgot our culture and accepted the Aryan culture now\nwe have been made into low people, sons of prostitutes,\nSudras and Panchamas.\n[Viduthalai, 27-1-1950]\nCaste discrimination\nIn the Gurukulam, the Brahmin students were fed with\n'uppuma' and the non-Brahmin students were fed with old\nrice. For these Brahmin boys they teach Vedas and for our\nchildren they teach Devaram and Thiruvasagam. There were\n\n254\n\n\fdifferent water pots for Brahmin and non-Brahmin boys.\nThis difference in treatment existed even in those days.\n[Viduthalai, 30-3-1950]\nCommunal Representation\nCaste that gives distinction or low status should be\nabolished. Till people get equal opportunities in\nemployment, education and politics, backward class people\nmust be given communal representation.\nThis nation has 3% Brahmins, 16% Depressed Classes\nand 72% Non-Brahmins. Posts should be given only in this\nratio. But on the contrary, the 3% people say that they are\nalone qualified and talented, so they usurp all the highly\npaid posts in every department. How can anyone accept the\nstatements of these 3% Brahmins who occupy more than\n97% of such posts?\n[Viduthalai, 9-4-1950]\nUntouchability\nLike doctors, the healers tried to abolish untouchability by\npreaching equality in all walks of life.\nBut we question: What is untouchability? How did it\ncome?\nWe see that it has come only due to religion. It is due to\nSastras. How did Sastras come? It is the rule of god. So the\nreligion that supports Sastras and the Sastras made by god\nshould be abolished if untouchability is to be abolished.\n[Viduthalai, 16-4-1950]\nSudra\nIf one goes to Bombay and calls somebody a Sudra he will\nnot get angry, or if one goes to Punjab and calls somebody a\nSudra he will not get angry, but if you go to a Dravidian\ncountry and call somebody a Sudra he will feel insulted.\nThus only one out of nine people feel bad to be called\nSudra. In a republic country, why should the Brahmin, the\nSudra, and the Panchama exist?\n\n255\n\n\fShould the government not give the police a pair of\nscissors to cut the holy thread, whoever is wearing it?\n[Viduthalai, 12-11-1950]\nPunishment for caste discrimination\nIt is written 'Brahmins Club' in bold letters and so on.\nWhoever practices caste in this nation, whether Brahmin or\nSudra or Panchama, should be imprisoned for a year.\n[Viduthalai, 12-11-1950]\nBritish and Brahmins\nThe British conspire with the Brahmins. This is the existing\nrelationship between a white Aryan and a yellow Aryan.\nOnly such agreements are made here. All other talks are\nstrategy. I said this two years ago. Jinnah and Ambedkar say\nit now.\nSwaraj is to protect the social setup. For instance, in\nThiruvaiyaru when I said there should be no difference in\nfood; Sastri, B.S.Sivasami Iyer and T.R.Venkatarama Sastri\nquestioned the British by saying that they were over riding\nthe agreement. We should break this. Whoever stands as a\nhindrance to the rule and peace of the nation by having the\nname of his community must be put behind bars for six\nmonths.\nWill not the British laugh at the existence of the\nBrahmin caste and the Paraiyar caste and the fact that one\ncaste cannot enter into hotels?\n[Viduthalai, 14-2-1951]\nUntouchability\nAn intelligent man has intelligence not in all the fields but\nonly in few fields. He will not use his mind in certain fields,\nbecause applying ones mind in such fields is a sin and at\ntimes, dangerous! So, only out of fear, he does not apply his\nmind in certain fields and has never used it in some fields.\nThat is why we have remained Sudras, Panchamas,\ndegraded people, low people, backward class people,\nUntouchables and so on. We do not research in these\n\n256\n\n\fdirections. Even if we research in these areas, we are\npunished. Because of the fear that we would be punished,\nwe do not research in these areas. So, can we say people are\nbrainless? They have brains; they use it in certain fields and\ndo not use it in other fields at times due to their fear.\n[Viduthalai, 27-3-1951]\nHinduism and Caste System\nIf the Varnashrama Dharma is to be annihilated, Hinduism\nmust be annihilated. As long as Hinduism exists, one should\naccept the caste system. Caste can be destroyed only by the\ndestruction of Hinduism. Gods and Sastras that are the basis\nof Hinduism must be destroyed. Maintaining one and\ndestroying another cannot be done. If anyone says so he is a\nfool.\n[Viduthalai, 30-5-1951]\nStruggle for Rights\nIf we have to get our rights, it means that we have to snatch\nour rights from our enemies. It only means the destruction\nof their supremacy. Only then we can get our rights. This is\nnot an easy task. It is not only a great task, but also several\npeople have to die and certainly there will be bloodshed.\nApart from the support of caste, religion, god, rule and\nSastras, the power and support that our enemies have is very\ngreat. Our government also would only support them. Our\nenemies have more unity. We do not have any strength.\nOnly we should have mental courage.\n[Viduthalai, 30-5-1951]\nConstitution of India\nThey have protected Sudrahood in the decision of making a\npolitical party. They formed a committee to write the\nConstitution of India. In the four-member committee all\nwere from the orthodox Brahmin community. They were\nT.T. Krishnamachari, Sir Alladi Krishna Iyer, K.M Munshi\nand Tirumalai Rao. Then they added three more, viz. Dr.\nAmbedkar, one Muslim and one Christian. The\n\n257\n\n\frepresentation from non-Brahmins i.e., Dravidians was nil,\nthough they form nearly three-fourths of the population. On\nthe contrary, four out of the seven members are Brahmins,\nand they represent less than 3% of the population.\nDr. Ambedkar fought for the Adi Dravidars. They\ninformed him that they would give anything for his people\nwithout protest but on the only condition that he should not\ntalk about others (Dravidians, that is non-Brahmins).\nAccordingly, Dr.Ambedkar got reservation as per\nrepresentation of the population for his people.\nThus the Adi Dravidars obtained what they wanted. But\nthey say it is wrong for us to ask for reservation as per our\npercentage in population, that is communal representation.\nWhoever asks for such reservation is termed sectarian.\n[Viduthalai, 22-9-1951]\nSwaraj and Untouchability\nI was a very rich businessman. Even as a businessman I did\na lot of social work. I joined the Congress in 1920. Gandhi\nsaid that he would not support Swaraj. Even if we demand\nSwaraj it will be only after the social reformation of\nabolishing untouchability and caste differences. I was not of\nthe opinion that one should be in politics to serve people.\n[Viduthalai, 14-10-1951]\nCaste Annihilation\nIn any other nation in the world do people put holy ash on\ntheir forehead or any other mark of religion on their\nforehead? Such types of devotees, like the Nayanmars and\nAlwars, have not been found in other nations. As the caste\nsystem was very strong, all those who tried to annihilate\ncaste were annihilated.\n[Viduthalai, 21-2-1952]\nBrahminism\nBrahminism has enslaved us by religion, rituals, god and\ncustoms and not by force or guns or arms.\n[Viduthalai, 22-2-1952]\n\n258\n\n\fInter-caste marriage\nCaste system cannot and will not be annihilated by intercaste marriage. A new caste will be created by this\nintercaste marriage. The only means to annihilate caste is\nthrough laws and the Constitution. It is difficult to\nannihilate caste while retaining the Sastras. Only these nonBrahmins have caste by which they degrade others. In the\ncase of Brahmins, all the divisions like Rao, Iyer, and\nIyengar are only treated as Brahmins. Inter-caste marriages\nhave not changed the differences in caste.\n[Viduthalai, 27-2-1952]\nAnnihilation of Caste\nBrahmin is a high caste that can directly send telegrams to\ngod. A very dirty Brahmin, a leprosy-infected Brahmin or a\ndishonest Brahmin is deemed high-caste. He should be\nrespected by other castes.\nLikewise if a very intelligent, talented man is born in\nanother caste he is deemed a Paraiyar or Sudra or\nprostitute's son.\nHe is expected to serve the Brahmins with folded hands.\nSuch wonderful situation cannot occur in any other nation!\n'Sudra' means serve the Brahmins endlessly. Everyone\nmust do physical labour except the Brahmin. The situation\nwill change only by banishing caste, god, religion and\nSastras.\n[Viduthalai, 2-7-1952]\nPolitics\nPeople should do only one thing: they should hate dishonest\ntraitors, honourless and characterless men who come up as\nrepresentatives of the nation. Because people do not punish\nor protest against dishonest traitors and characterless\npeople, they fearlessly gain recognition in society. Politics\nhas gone to its lowest state and no religion or caste is\nbackward in this activity. In society, honest and good\n\n259\n\n\fpoliticians should come to power and these dishonest\ntraitors must be driven away.\n[Viduthalai, 7-7-1952]\nAryans and Dravidians\nIn Dravidian country, especially among the Tamil-speaking\npeople there is a strong demarcation of caste and cultural\ndifferences between the Aryans and Dravidians. This would\nbe helpful at sometime or other. So my struggles will not be\nwasted.\n[Viduthalai, 15-7-1952]\nCaste and Labour\nIn any country, the workers union will stop with the\ndifference of rich and poor but in our country it does not\nstop with rich and poor but it protects the castes of Brahmin\nand Sudra and Paraiyar. This difference should be\ndestroyed.\n[Viduthalai, 7-10-1952]\nNames and Caste\nYou would have observed that varnashrama dharma is\nfollowed in naming us. All nice and beautiful names are\nassigned only for the upper castes. The names of gods and\nreligious names are kept for the upper caste and these names\nshould not be used for the Sudras and Panchamas. It is a sin\nif they keep these names. For instance, names like Raman,\nKrishnan, Saraswathi, Parvathi are the names of upper caste\npeople and names like Karuppan, Mookan, Veeran, Katteri,\nKaruppayi are assigned for the low caste people.\n[Viduthalai, 24-3-1953]\nBetrayers\nEven today, they create Hanumans and Vibhishanas among\nus and they tell them to hit us. We need to tackle this. In our\nstruggle, the Brahmins will not come like the Devas\n(celestial beings) who came according to the Puranas. They\nwill only instigate and make the traitors like Vibhishana and\n\n260\n\n\fHanuman to fight against us. Our problem is: If we have to\noppose and attack, we will only be attacking our own\npeople. Should we fight among ourselves? That is why I\ncontrol my people. Those who are coming to fight with us\ntoday will change at some point of time. For how long can\nthe Brahmins feed them and give them wages and make\nthem fight against us?\n[Kudiarasu, 4-8-1953]\nPolitics/ Personal\nComrades! Only if we take efforts to solve these differences\nin my lifetime, it can be solved. I say this truly. Only if we\ntake some efforts during my lifetime we can achieve\nsuccess without carnage or bloodshed. If I die, what might\nhappen afterwards? Why? After the person is not there, only\nthe strength of the text remains. So, there shall come a\nsituation where might becomes right. There are no\nresponsible people, no one is concerned and takes effort.\nThere is no one other than those who cause carnages and\nshow their presence, and those who gain profit and publicity\nthrough this.\n[Viduthalai , 8-9-1953]\nLabourers\nA labourer should not be rationalistic because if he were\nrationalistic it would affect the company. They deal with the\nproblem only at the pay level and they will not allow a\nlabourer to think why should he not be an owner. Suppose a\nscavenger's son gets educated, who will do the scavenging\njob? So they want these practices to be steadily carried out.\nIn India we should demolish the caste through agitations!\n[Viduthalai, 3-10-1953]\nAbolition of Brahmins\nIn India there were 562 kings. After Independence they put\ndown their crown and got around Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2,00,000\nand left us. A day came when there were no kings in\nhistory. We have changed to such situation. Zamindars have\n\n261\n\n\frun away! Next, rich people are there. A day will come\nwhen we would ask why do you need 1000 or 2000 acres of\nland? He too will be abandoned. When such changes take\nplace why need for a beggar Brahmin!\n[Viduthalai, 8-10-1953]\nEducational policy\nAs soon as Comrade Rajaji introduced the hereditary\neducational policy, only I said at first, \"This educational\npolicy is a casteist educational policy; this has to be\nopposed and abolished.\" The people supported me. Several\npeople of other parties, why, even several people from\nCongress opposed this scheme.\nWhat is this scheme? What do you think is the basis for\nthis scheme? Is this educational scheme not a reconstruction\nand protection of varnashrama?\nAccording to this educational scheme, every child\nshould study for sometime every day, and the rest of the\ntime they should practice their hereditary caste occupation.\nWho physically labours and slaves in the name of caste?\nOnly we, who are called Sudras.\nIf we ask: \"What? Should we keep doing the caste\noccupation while Brahmins alone get positions,\nemployment, authority and go higher and higher? Must it be\nso? Is this justified?\" Then, they will immediately say just\none word, \"You are sectarian.\"\nI wish to say, \"We don't think that physical labour is\ndisgraceful, but why should we alone do that work?\"\nEverybody can do it according to their percentages (in the\npopulation). Instead of that, if it is said that we, the\nDravidian people alone must do such physical labour; and\nthat Brahmins need not do any of it, they can lead a high life\njust remaining seated in one place and without any dirt\ntouching their nails, what justice is there in this?\nThe British who were 6000 miles away from our\ncountry ruled us. Though he controlled us and ruled us, he\ntreated us as human beings. He ate from our people. He did\nnot say that he would not touch us!\n\n262\n\n\fOnly those who are called Paraiyars by the Brahmins\nwere the butlers and cooks in British homes. So the outsider\nBrahmin says he should not touch us. Our touch is\npolluting. He says he is born in the face; so he is the first\ncaste, you are born from the leg so you are the lowest caste.\nHe sees to it that our people do not come up in any field; he\ncontrols, rules and enslaves us. To do so he has taken hold\nof the law, rule, government, religion and god. How can we\nhave this type of foreigners?\nThe work we do is not for our benefit. It is not for our\nselfish, self-centered profit or comfort. To wipe out this\ndegraded state of all Dravidians who are Sudras, Paraiyars\nand Chakkiliyars; if we wipe out Sudrahood, will not all\nDravidians become better? If we had this feeling and\ncontrol, will Rajaji and the Brahmins have come to this\nlevel?\nHow much of opposition to Rajaji's minister post?\nThough the situation is such that his post can topple any\nday. If he can manage all that and still have a tight grip,\nwhat is it for? Only to save his race, only for the protection\nof the Brahmin society. As long as he is in power, he wants\nto fill up Brahmins in all the places. He wants to repress the\nSudras, and with that motive alone he remains in power.\nAmong us we do not have this mind, this feeling, this racial\nfanaticism! He fights for the welfare of the Brahmin race;\nour people do not come forward to struggle like that!\n[Viduthalai, 17/18-11-1953]\nEducational policy\nRajaji says that people in the villages do not need education.\nHe has said that the student in the village should cut hair, he\nshould wash clothes, and he should make pots and pans.\nThe village school is only for three hours duration, the rest\nof the time our children should graze donkeys, this is called\nthe New Primary Education Scheme. We organized a\nconference in Erode only to oppose this educational\nscheme.\nCan we keep looking at law and democracy in such a\nsituation? The work will be successful only through a great\n\n263\n\n\frevolution. Though 100, 1000 of us will have to be\nsacrificed, we need to be prepared.\nThat is why even I gave a three months notice; and said\nthat if they want to shoot, let them shoot. I am going to start\na struggle. This educational scheme has to be destroyed by\nall means.\n[Viduthalai, 26-2-1954]\nEducational policy\nWhat should we do now? We should be ready for the\nagitation. If a man has shame, he has to go to the jail at least\nonce. That is the test of integrity for a man now.\nIf our elders backtrack by chance, only the youngsters\nmust certainly do this. Otherwise, the next generation after\nus will only have to graze cattle. This is the only\ninformation I have to say about the hereditary educational\nsystem.\nToday, do those who call themselves social reformers\nstrive to abolish caste? Will the Brahmin agree to end caste?\nThat is why I say that any one except us does not have this\nscheme. We say that for the annihilation of caste, the entire\nbasis of caste must also be annihilated. No one will say that\nthe basis for these differences such as religion, Sastras, God\nmust be annihilated. No one will accept this. So, it is a\ndifficult problem. Because that has to be said substantially\nto the people, we are revealing to people the doctrines of\nBuddha.\nBuddha said this 2000, 3000 years ago. Even the\ngovernment accepts Buddha's philosophy. They have\nembossed in the national flag the chakra of Emperor\nAshoka, who walked the path of Buddha. Does it not mean\nthat they have accepted his philosophy? As though this is\nnot enough, it is also being said that Buddha is the tenth\navatar of Vishnu. If this Ramasamy (Periyar) says\nsomething, it is wrong; if the Dravidar Kazhagam says it is\nwrong. But the Buddha himself said so, and he said it\ncandidly.\n[Viduthalai, 7-3-1954]\n\n264\n\n\fBuddhism\nWe, the working people, have been made into low caste; we\nare starving. We don't have clothes to wear; we don't have\na place to live. But the Brahmin who doesn't work has all\nkinds of comforts and honour.\nOnly you built these temples. Only you gave the money.\nWhen it is so, can we just leave the god who says that we\nare low caste and untouchable? \"Ungrateful god, only I built\nthe temples and the tanks for you. Only I spend money on\nyou.\" Should you not ask why you are lower caste or why\nyou should not be touched? You believe what the Brahmins\nsay, that is, if you ask such questions the god will get angry.\nIt was resolved in the Buddhism Propaganda\nConference at Erode that such a god needs to be abolished.\nThe World Buddha Sangha's President Mallala Sekara\npresided over that conference. Mr.Rajbhoj, who is the\nSecretary of the All India Depressed Classes Association\nand a Member of Parliament, inaugurated the conference.\nHe spoke, \"The policies of the Buddha are your policies, the\nSelf-Respect policies.\"\n[Viduthalai, 14-3-1954]\nAnnihilation of Caste\nIf our people realize the truth that they remain poor and\nenslaved only because of caste, all the castes will be\nharmed. Since the enjoyment and dominance of Brahmins\nwill be destroyed due to this, the poet Subramania Bharati\ncarefully sings in favour of the upper castes. \"Aayiram undu\ningu saadhi, enil anniyar vandhu pugalenna needhi (There\nare thousands of castes here/ Why should the outsiders\ncome and tell justice?\") that is, \"There will be thousands of\ncastes in our nation. For that, an outsider must not come and\nquestion. What is his work here?\" he writes. If someone\nsays that the raft has a hole but only the river's water must\nnot enter it, can we say that it is an intelligent thing?\nExcept us, who toils for the annihilation of all this? The\nreform that others suggest, the British themselves destroyed\nthose differences and went away. He (the British) gave to\n\n265\n\n\fthe Depressed Classes the post of President in Panchayat\nBoards, District Boards, Municipalities. He made our friend\nSivaraj a Member of the Legislative Assembly. He wrote in\nhis law that there should be a fine for saying 'Paraiyan': that\nexists even now.\n[Viduthalai, 16-3-1954]\nEducation\n\"Only the Brahmins should read, the Sudras should not\nread; the Brahmins should not teach the Sudras.\" This is\nwhat the Manu Dharma says.\nRajaji did this only because of the fear that the position\nof his society will disappear. If the Vanaan washes clothes,\nif the Paraiyan beats the drums, if the Chakkili stitches\nshoes, if the Ambattan shaves, only then they will get the\nfeeling that they are a low caste. If they also get educated\nand come ahead, the highness of the upper castes will\ndisappear. So, Rajaji interfered in the basics by introducing\na 3-hour occupational education.\nHow did Rajaji who did not contest an election become\na Minister? There is no place to remove these atrocious\npeople through law. Who prepared this Constitution? Did\nonly four Brahmins not prepare it? Dr.Ambedkar who\nbelonged to the Depressed Classes was there. He had\nthought that if his caste gets 5% representation it is enough.\nBut when he was given 15% he got exhilarated and he\nplaced his signature.\nLater, I said that I would burn that Constitution. He\nsaid, \"Now, only I will burn that Constitution.\" Why?\nBecause he understood its truth, its strength.\nThe servant of this Rajaji, C. Subramanian was the one\nwho raised his hand to say that Sudras don't need\ncommunal representation. Those who had gone on the merit\nof our votes were sitting there like the five Pandavas during\nDraupadi's disrobing. All this takes place in this country. If\nit had been another country, four or five (death)\nanniversaries would have been observed for such people.\nWhen it is so, how can we fight legally?\n\n266\n\n\fWhen I said that the idol of Vinayaka should be broken,\nthey talked of beating my effigy with slippers. I don't\nbother even a little about that. It is not being beaten for my\npersonal matter. Is it being beaten because of the work I did\nfor public good? I only considered it as a reward. Even if I\nam myself beaten I will get longer life and years.\n[Viduthalai, 17-4-1954]\nRamayana\nRamayana was a conspiracy story created by Brahmins only\nto save Varnashrama dharma. Only to establish their\ndoctrines, they say that Vishnu himself took the avatar of\nRama.\nRama rules after having brought Sita from Ravanan. At\nthat time a young Brahmin child dies. Its father goes to\nRama and says, \"Because you or your populace are\nindulging in activities against the law, my son has died\ntoday; a Brahmin has to live for 100 years, if he dies\nprematurely it means that the King of that land is acting in\nviolation of the Sastras.\"\nWhen Rama goes around the country, in a forest he sees\na Sudra called Sambhukan praying to God in order to attain\nmoksha (salvation). When Rama realizes that he is a Sudra,\nhe tells him: \"If a Sudra does penance to god it is violative\nof Sastras. If he wants to attain moksha, he should be a\nslave of a Brahmin and follow his commands, and if the\nBrahmin is satisfied, the Sudra may attain moksha.\" So\nRama said, \"You are violating the Laws of Manu\" and with\none arrow he severed his head. It seems that as the Sudra\nSambhukan died, the dead Brahmin child came to life. In\nthis manner, the story of Rama was fabricated to save caste\nand religion.\n[Viduthalai, 11-10-1954]\nRamayana\nHow does the Ramayana end? Because Sambhukan, a Sudra\nprayed to god a Brahmin boy died. Rama found this Sudra\nand killed him, so this dead Brahmin boy immediately came\n\n267\n\n\fto life. What is the idea they want to drive in the minds of\nthe public?\nA Sudra should not worship god directly! He should\nworship god only through a Brahmin.\n[Call for revolution, 1954]\nBrahmin domination\nToday, even a Brahmin who begs has coffee twice a day but\nthink of a farmer who toils all day in the sun and does not\nknow what is coffee; he drinks only gruel with salt. On the\nother hand, any Brahmin working in a hotel or temple\neducates his children well and they become collector, judge,\nminister or President of India. But we toil and remain in the\nlowest position.\nIs the ex-Chief Minister Rajagopalachari son of a Lord?\nNo, he is just a purohit's (Brahmin priest's) son. He studied\nwith the aid of scholarship. So also is the grandfather of\nNehru, our ex-Prime Minister. President Rajendra Prasad's\nfather was a tribal Brahmin. So, they have all risen to this\nposition only because of their caste. Once our people\nbecome a little rich, they never feel that they belong to low\ncaste. Have we ever thought over this? Never!\nWe want money somehow, and others should say that\nwe are rich. We will spend money in constructing temples,\nperforming Kumbhabishekams (consecration), and give 100,\n200, 300, ..., 1000 acres of land to the Brahmins. We once\nled a very high life. Only now, that too after the coming of\nthe Brahmins, have we become a low caste. In any country,\nhas a worker who works for the nation ever become a low\ncaste?\nThese Brahmins who came for green pastures for their\ncattle made us build temples and make idols of god. Finally\nthey said that if we touch these gods, the gods will die or\nbecome polluted by our touch. The Hindu pundits and the\nrich accepted all these, consequent of this we have become\nUntouchables and ruined ones. There are animals but does\nthere exist a Brahmin donkey or an untouchable donkey?\n[Viduthalai, 6-5-1954]\n\n268\n\n\fDivision of Labour\nWhy are you a labourer? You are a labourer because you\nare of the labourer's caste,. Otherwise, does any Brahmin\nlike Sharma, Sastri, and Rao etc. ever do your work? Today\nthe labourers pull carts. They do laundry. They do manual\nscavenging. They work as peons. All of them are Sudras! If\nwe look at why they are in these jobs, the reason is caste.\nWhy does he sweep the streets? What reason can be\nattributed? If we ask 'Why does any Brahmin not sweep the\nstreets? Why does any Brahmin woman not sell\nbuttermilk?' he will say, \"This is a backward, regressive\nforce.\"\nYou must think well. You need to question your minds.\nFor several ages, there has been 'Paraiyan' and\n'Paraichi.' Did anyone say that this must be eradicated?\nOnly the man who does not bother about the infamy he will\nget will dare to say this. If it comes from the mouth of\nanother, he needs to attain the necessary benefit.\nEven now, will those in public life say that caste should\nbe annihilated? Ambedkar made the law. In that he was not\nallowed to write that caste should be annihilated. They told\nhim, \"Write what you want for your caste alone.\" They\nallowed him to write 15% for his own caste. Why did they\nallow? Because, if it is given to that society, there is no one\namong them. Later, he revolted a little. They have beaten\nhim such that he can't rear his head. Even such an\nAmbedkar himself did not say so. Who else can say?\nWhy could the Buddha not annihilate caste? He got\ncheated by talking of Ahimsa (non-violence). The Jain was\nalso similarly cheated. They were in the opinion of not even\nkilling an insect.\nToday, everyone is our enemy. Why? Because I say that\ncaste should be annihilated. Though they know that it is\ngood for everybody if this takes place, they don't extend\nsupport. Instead they oppose it. Now we have got into a\nmajor struggle. That is why we oppose. This is the only job\nfor four High Court Judges. These Ministers also have the\n\n269\n\n\fsame job. The Dravidar Kazhagam has written in order to\ncompensate their preaching, their newspapers and books\netc.\nYesterday, they have dismissed a constable. When we\nask what the charge was, they said that they had removed\nhim on the suspicion that he participated in activities of the\nDravidar Kazhagam. Any teacher, any professor, any clerk\nwho joins us is immediately dismissed. This has to be made\nknown to the people. The Brahmin society itself must be\ndestroyed. Sudras must not remain lazy without worrying\nabout these people who created so much fraud. If you\ncannot, at least leave your children with me. With them, I\nwill finish off these Brahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 7-6-1954]\nAnnihilation of Caste\nSun Yat Sen was born in China and caused the reformation.\nKemal Pasha was born in Turkey and made changes. But in\nTamil Nadu, Siddhars, Valluvar and Buddha have been born\nand they wanted to abolish caste yet no changes have come.\nAll the workers are our people but still they continue to be\nlow caste. In the Malaya state, an Ezhava should not walk in\nthe street but now due to changes he can walk in all the\nstreets. But untouchability still exists in Tamil Nadu.\nWhat happened to Gandhi? He became a Mahatma but\nwas a victim of three bullets. The Laws of Manu say that a\nSudra should not read, but Gandhi said everyone should\nread. What happened? He was shot dead by a Brahmin.\nGandhi said that Hindu religion and Muslim religion were\none and the same. So he was shot dead.\nProtest against change will always exist, so don't worry\nabout that. Each and every one of you should strive for\nequality and annihilate the difference between low and high\ncastes. All of you remain united as Tamilians. Help those\nwho struggle. The basis of my service is only annihilation\nof caste.\n[Viduthalai, 23-12-1954]\n\n270\n\n\fDivision of Labour\nA section of people who fatten up without working are\ncalled upper caste-Brahmins. Those who keep on toiling,\nthose who starve, those who go from village to village and\nlose their life in the midst of all this are low caste-\nSudras-Panchamas-the fourth caste-the fifth caste;\nwhat a contradictory activity! Should we not abolish this?\n**\nWhen there are representatives in the Legislative Assembly\nwho say that it is pathetic for a man pulling a rickshaw, why\nis there no representative who says that manual scavenging\nis disgraceful, humiliating and unhygienic?\n**\nIt is a disgrace to the human society, when there exists the\noccupation of manual scavenging in a country. This method\nis not necessary. All over the country there should be a\nmodern scientific method of automatic waste-disposal.\n**\nThe Dravidians should not go to those temples where\nBrahmins function as priests and where there is compulsion\nthat only Brahmins must perform prayer rituals. Even if\nthey go, they should not have the prayers or rituals\nperformed by Brahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 19-1-1955]\nAnnihilation of Caste\nThe world's virtuous, the greatest of Mahatmas, has he said\none word that caste should be annihilated? He only said that\nuntouchability must not be there. Has he said a word that\ncaste should be annihilated? Moreover, he only said, \"I\nstruggle for the protection of Hindu religion. I came for the\nestablishment of the Varnashrama dharma. It is my primary\naim to create Ram Rajya.\" He blatantly spoke of whatever\nwas necessary for the protection of caste and he also said\nthat he was working for the same.\nOnly because he said so, he could live this long and get\nthe title of Mahatma. The Brahmins assassinated him only\nbecause he, having realized that Hinduism is itself a fraud,\n\n271\n\n\fsaid in spite of himself that caste problems should be\nannihilated.\nIn the same manner, the Brahmins ensured that there\nwas no evidence about every great person who came to\nannihilate caste. Buddha and Valluvar came like this and the\nBrahmins victimized them severely. Till now, Valluvar's\nKural was not known widely. Only because of our ruckus,\npeople have started reading it. Though Buddha was born in\nthis country and preached here, his ideology is present in\nother countries but not even to a little extent here. What is\nthe reason? In the course of time Buddha's philosophy\ncould not spread here without any barriers.\nIf I survive even now, it is a different matter. There is a\nplan, and a betrayers' group, to annihilate me. There will be\nconspirators waiting as to when I will get caught so they can\nput an end to me. This is because the work that I do causes a\nlot of trouble to the Brahmins. Without any means of living\nthey have to flee the country. That is why I know that there\nwill be such an opposition from them.\nToday if I leave all my policies and say, \"Religion\nshould be there. The greatness of the Hindu religion created\nby God himself is really immense! The Brahmins are men\nof avatar! They are next to God! Only yesterday night,\nAmbal appeared in my dream and said these truths\" it is\nenough. Immediately, I could become a Mahatma. They\nwill say that Mahatma E.V.Ramasamy is the tenth avatar of\nVishnu. My portrait will hang in the entrance of the house\nof every Brahmin. Daily they will worship it with garlands,\nincense and offer it flowers and fruits. Seeing me say so, the\ngovernment will also say that the devil has left us and it will\nplan a major fraud. They will think, \"Only one man was a\ngreat enemy, from now we are free\" and they will enjoy.\nI say this because there has been a conspiracy against\nsuch a great man in the world like Gandhi who lived in front\nof us. At such a time, even though I feel that even I have a\nrisk, day-by-day I am more intense because I don't care\nabout such threats. By saying my truths to the people, even\nthey have understood the atrocities of the Brahmins and the\ndishonesty in the Sastras, puranas and they have reached a\n\n272\n\n\fstage of feeling Self-respect. From now, they will only\nstrive to remove their disgrace. I feel that I do not have the\nnecessity to work like I worked earlier. Till my death, I will\ndare to say the basic mantras and the policies of the\nKazhagam. That is why, I research fabricated stories like\nRamayana that were intended to save religion and establish\nthe low state of Dravidians, and expose their obscene,\nuncivilized stuff first through the Kudiarasu and through\nother published books. Now I go from village to village, get\nseveral Ramayana books and point out the errors in them.\n[Viduthalai, 24-3-1955]\nRationalism\nLike the other countries, even we have to be intelligent\npeople and be one caste, the human caste. We need to give\nspace for rationalism and have the human quality of\nfollowing anything as per rationalism-that is how our\ndoctrines have been made. Only on the basis of that\ndoctrine, we say that Brahmins have to be driven away from\nour country, puranas must be burnt; and that the idols of\nGods must be broken and using that streets must be laid.\nTemples must be demolished and razed to the ground.\nTheir limitless wealth must be spent on improvement of\nhuman society. For all this to take place, we carry out\nagitation and propaganda and publish our opinion through\nnewspapers. So, it must be the duty of Dravidians to\nencourage and support these.\n[Viduthalai, 15-4-1955]\nNon-Brahmins\nThe necessity for us to take part in such activities is\nprimarily because we want our low status and disgraceful\ncaste titles like Sudra, Panchama to be removed. We were\nthe first ones to plan that such low caste titles should be\nabolished.\nThe feeling of Brahmins and non-Brahmins started in\nthe year 1894-95. Those who realized the cruelty of the\n\n273\n\n\fBrahmins strived to condemn it. They had given it in\nwriting to the Government.\n[Viduthalai, 20-4-1955]\nPolitics\nNehru condemned caste on his recent visit here. Till now\nthey did not have so much of concern in condemning the\ncaste system, we do not understand what is the sudden\nreason for their talking about it now. The annihilation of\ncaste atrocities and caste itself-We are not able to say how\nfar this will be true.\nAs the next stage, the general election is going to come.\nWe feel that only with this in mind, Nehru speaks these\nensnaring words. Majority of the votes is only with the\nDepressed Classes. They have realized the truth that if they\nhave the confidence of upper castes and Brahmins, that\nalone will not fetch them votes. So, to trap the Depressed\nClasses in their nets, they speak so.\n[Viduthalai, 28-10-1955]\nBuddha\nDid anyone ask if low caste and high caste existed\nhistorically? Only Buddha questioned. He was a king's son.\nHe questioned several things. He asked, \"Why is he an old\nman? Why was that man a servant? Why is he blind?\"\nBuddha asked, \"Why is he a low caste man?\" They replied\nthat god created it. Then he asked, \"Where is that god who\ncreated the low caste?\"\nThen they spoke about the athma (soul). He asked,\n\"What is it? Was the athma seen?\"\nThey chased away such persons who worked for the\nnation! Buddha Jayanthi is celebrated in the month of May\nin the days 24,25,26 and 27. They requested me to join the\ncelebrations and I accepted the request made on behalf of\ntheir association.\nAlso, I request Dravidar Kazhagam comrades to join the\ncelebrations and campaign about the advice and laws given\nby the Buddha.\n\n274\n\n\fThe most important of Buddha's principles are\n1. Use your intellect to analyze everything clearly.\n2. If your intellect says it is correct then accept it.\nDon't believe the terms like God, Athma, Devas, Heaven,\nHell, Brahmin, Sudra and Panchama that you cannot\nunderstand. They are only imaginary terms. Use your\ncommon sense to analyze every object. Do not follow\nanything because God said so, Vedas says so or Manu says\nso and trust them. What your mind says believe that alone.\n[Viduthalai, 19-4-1956]\nAryan domination\nOnly the Aryans made the Dravidians barbaric by denying\nthem education and all sorts of development and made them\na low people.\nBut in these 35 years of the Self Respect Movement,\npeople who are in castes lower than the Sudras have become\nChief Minister, one Sudra has become a High Court Judge,\none Sudra has become Inspector General of Police, one\nSudra has become an Education Officer. This is actually\nagainst the Laws of Manu. In Tamil Nadu such things have\nhappened against the cunningness of these Brahmins.\nDr. Ambedkar boldly said in the Lok Sabha, \"I don't\nbelieve in god or spirit\" and completely came away from\nthe Aryans.\n[Thozhan, 20-5-1956]\nHinduism/ Vedas\nThe person who follows the Vedas doesn't know anything\nabout Hindu religion. Only due to the mantras and Sastras,\nwe have Brahmin and Paraiyar, high caste \u2013 low caste,\ncountless gods, lakhs of temples and trash.\n[Viduthalai, 3-6-1956]\n\n275\n\n\fCaste discriminatory practices\nWho said that the Paraiyan, Chakkili, etc. should enter into\nthe temple? Only this Ramasamy said so at first. That too, I\nsaid that the Gods must be broken and roads must be laid\nwith the debris. Only after we said that we would leave this\nreligion and become Muslims did the others open their\nmouths. Even at that time, several people said that worms\nwould infest my tongue. Before we carried out the selfrespect propaganda and reform, there was segregation in\nteashops, they were not allowed to board buses. You will\nnot know this because 30 years ago all of you were children.\nAt that time the Depressed Classes could not walk on the\nstreets. They have to walk only over the sewers. They were\nnot allowed into theater. Notices that 'Panchamas and those\nwith contagious diseases are not allowed' would be\ndisplayed. Only the Brahmins cooked in hotels. Brahmins\nwould eat separately, and we would eat separately. Does\nthis take place now? Who changed all this? Which party\nworked for this? Which religious head said this?\nIf those who scavenge don't do so, will it not stink? If\nthose who sweep don't do so, garbage will collect here and\nthere. If those who wash clothes don't do so, we will have\nto wash it ourselves. If the farmers do not cultivate, then we\nwill not get food. If the weavers do not weave, there will be\nshortage of clothes. But if the Brahmins are not there, what\nwork would not take place?\nIn other countries, does work go on because of\nBrahmins? Brahmins don't have any occupation. What\nwork does he do apart from spinning a yarn in sleep (lazing\naround)? It is a good thing the British put numbers,\notherwise for every milestone and furlong stone our people\nthemselves will stand there, call a Brahmin to ask him, \"Can\nwe go ahead only if we give money?\"\nSo, several people among us should struggle to the\nextent of losing our lives. Then Brahmins will come\nforward to say, \"We will also work along with you. Our\nwomen will also come to transplant crops, they will also\nwork.\"\n\n276\n\n\fA man, who does not do anything for God, flies in the\nsky. Only our people, 2000 of them will pull a wooden\nchariot for a distance of a furlong. These people make a riot\nas if mad men were fed liquor. So, we must reform our\npeople. We should see that our children are not\nsuperstitious. We should ourselves ask why they smear ash.\nHe must think and research and know the answer. Only then\nintelligence will develop among our people.\n[Viduthalai, 18-7-1956]\nSocial Reform\nIn all my demonstrations for social reformation I have spent\nmy body, money, mind and spirit and I am waiting to spend\nthis life. Instead of fighting, people get refuge from\nSankaracharyas.\n[Viduthalai, 30-7-1956]\nMorality in Hinduism\nThe human qualities of one man cheating another, upper\ncaste-lower caste, heaven-hell, ritual and further the\nevidences in our religion about homosexual relationships,\nbestiality, illicit sex are read and enjoyed, lived and heard\nby the devotes so they have no moral values or fear for\nmoral values or even dislike or hatred for immoral and\nsinful acts.\nOur caste system has made the low caste into\nrespectless fools. High-caste men are culprits who cheat\nothers mercilessly with hearts of stone.\nUnlike Christianity or Islam, love of brotherhood or\naffection for others, or kindness, or respect for humans are\nnever found in this religion. In this religion, the dharma is\nthat one man should treat another as an untouchable, cheat\nhim, exploit him and live on others' labour etc. This is\nbeing preached and practiced. How can we have good\nconduct or moral standard?\n[Viduthalai, 3-8-1956]\n\n277\n\n\fPartition\nIf caste is not annihilated and this country does not become\nours we need to take swords and petrol in our hands. See, in\nAhmedabad slippers have become bouquets. Nehru begs,\n\"Other countries will tease us seeing the happenings here.\nPlease wait for five years. I feel ashamed to change the law\nwhich I made.\" Is it because he is afraid of the law, or is it\nbecause he is afraid of the violence?\nHow did the Muslims get Pakistan? Only with the\nsword! In Navakali did not 10,000, 12,000 people die. Take\neven today! Pakistan might have taken two beatings from\nIndia, but it is not that India has recaptured Pakistan. To\ncheat us, they kept talking ahimsa (non-violence) all the\ntime.\nIf we take a sword or a stick, will a Brahmin remain\nstanding? That is why he spoke of non-violence! A man\nwho does not keep a knife with him is a coward! If I have to\nsay more, I am going to say that even if you do not wear a\nblack shirt you should keep a knife with you. Only then we\nwill not have traitors among us.\nIf we make anyone influential, he turns into a traitor. If\nwe take a bachelor to the ceremony of seeing a girl as a\nprospective bride, will he scrutinize the bride for himself, or\nfor us?\nIn 1938, when the British were there, before\nindependence came, I said that we need a separate country.\nThe Congressmen say to me that what I say is correct.\nWhen there is so much of growing support if we lust for a\nlegislative assembly seat, a parliament seat, and permit\nlicence what does it mean? If the country goes like this, the\nSudra will have to become the son of a prostitute.\n[Viduthalai, 2-9-1956]\nCaste discrimination\nLet us assume that Nehru is going abroad on a tour.\nSomeone sees Nehru and asks him, \"It seems the people\nwho scavenge in your country are of one caste. Those who\nsweep the streets are of one caste. It seems there is a caste\n\n278\n\n\fcalled the Brahmins. If they touch others, it seems they\nwould get polluted. Is this true?\" What will he say then?\nCan he deny this? There is no other option for him than to\nsay, \"Yes, it is there. I am struggling to annihilate it.\"\nWe have to find out from where caste came. If a few\nParaiyars apply sacred ash on their foreheads, or the Mark\nof Vishnu will the Paraiyan quality go away? They think\nthat their disgraceful aspect has gone if four-five people\nbecome ministers and members of the Legislative\nAssembly. That only means the others are low people. After\nindependence they called themselves Paraiyar, Chakkiliyar,\nAdi Dravidar. Because it was against the Brahmins, they\ncalled themselves Harijans. Calling themselves Depressed\nClasses, Adi Dravidars, Harijans is only a mere change of\nname. What else is it?\nIf a chaste woman calls another woman, \"Chaste\nwoman, come here!\" what does it mean? It only means that\nshe herself accepts that she is not a chaste woman. Even in\n1956, if you call a pappan as a Brahmin, it only means that\nyou are accepting yourself to be a Sudra, a son of prostitute,\na low caste.\nIf this small thing cannot be changed, when and where\ndo we annihilate caste? Who will listen if we ask them not\nto say their caste names?\nIf we write to the government, \"He has put a board in\nhis hotel saying it is a Brahmin hotel and he wears a holy\nthread,\" they write back saying that is his right. If that is so,\nto establish our right what can we do apart from erasing the\nboard and cutting the holy thread and the tuft?\n[Viduthalai, 3-9-1956]\nDevelopment of the Depressed Classes\nIn this country, they have allocated two or three crore\nrupees for the development of the Depressed Classes. To\nwhom did they give it? They have placed it in front of the\nBrahmin who calls himself upper caste and on seeing us\nsays, \"Don't touch. Stand apart.\" If the Government had\ntrue concern about the advancement of the backward people\n\n279\n\n\fshouldn't they have given the money to me, since I have\nspent a lifetime working for the annihilation of caste?\nOtherwise they should have given it to the Depressed and\nBackward Classes and told them to improve their\ncommunities. Even now some people say Brahmins are\nbetter than our people! If they say these words even in 1956\nwhat does it mean?\nShould I not see a society where caste has been\nannihilated? You are young so you can see it later. I am in a\nstate of (passing away) today or tomorrow. If we say,\n\"Brahmins quit\" must we ask \"To where?\" Is it\nintelligence? The Brahmin can ask, \"I have the right to be in\nthis country.\" There is a meaning in his question. Can we\nDravidians ask that question? What have you achieved by\nstanding hidden for so long?\nIf caste has to be abolished, the Sastras must be burnt.\nThe gods must be broken down. Likewise, if we want\nfreedom, we must burn the national flag. Pakistan was\ncreated only by killing 1000, 2000 people. When Jinnah\nsaid that Pakistan was necessary, did one Muslim oppose it?\nIf one Muslim had opposed it, will any Muslim ever attend\nany life or death ritual in that man's house? You have seen\nit with your eyes. What does it mean if you speak like this?\nIf I say, \"Take the knife,\" you criticize.\n[Viduthalai, 4-9-1956]\nCaste discrimination\nThey said that after Swaraj comes, they would make the\nParaiyan sit in the center of the house and would make him\neat in the common dining. What has the Government done?\nEven now, the Sudra title has not changed! All this trouble\nis only because there are 33\u20444% Brahmins in this country. If\nthe Government really has the intention of annihilating caste\nit must have given scissors to the policemen and asked them\nto cut the holy thread and tuft if they spotted it.\nA few days back the government put a picture. In that a\nBrahmin says to a Dravidian, \"Don't touch. Go afar.\" In a\npicture below they show the Brahmin inside the jail because\n\n280\n\n\fhe displayed caste difference. In the picture on top the\nBrahmin has a sacred thread. In the picture below, it lacks\nthe sacred thread. This is because the Brahmins in jail do\nnot have sacred thread. According to prison rules, the sacred\nthread is not permitted. So, they have removed the sacred\nthread in accordance with the prison rules.\nThe government printed 10 lakh copies of this picture.\nOne picture cost 41\u20442 annas. On the advice of a Brahmin who\nsaid that it must not be published, and being afraid of him,\nthe government burnt all those pictures. What does it mean\nif they are scared of one Brahmin and burn all the pictures?\nFour crore rupees have been allocated for the\ndevelopment of Harijans and that amount has been given to\nthe Brahmins by the Government. The Brahmin financially\nsupports those Depressed Classes who betray us. For whom\ndid we break the Pillaiyar? For whom did we burn the\npicture of Rama? Why do we say that caste should be\nannihilated in this country? For whom do we say that\nBrahmins should be thrown out of this country? Everyone\nmust think over this.\n[Viduthalai, 12-9-1956]\nAnnihilation of Caste\nIn foreign countries, if a man is a barber, his brother would\nbe a minister, his father's younger brother would be\nlaunderer, his father's elder brother would be a judge. There\nis no separate caste structure for every occupation;\neverything is common for everyone abroad.\nIf caste is touched, religion will be destroyed. If caste is\nannihilated, harm will fall upon the Vedas, the Puranas, the\nSastras, God etc. If these are harmed, the livelihood of\nBrahmins will be harmed. That is why when we say that\ncaste should be annihilated, people like Rajaji say that it\nshould be protected. In a nation that is independent, in a\nnation that is said to have attained Swaraj, why should there\nbe one person called Brahmin and one person called\nParaiyan?\n\n281\n\n\fAsk the communists why Brahmins should alone be\nhigh caste? He will say, \"Don't talk about that. It is\nsectarian.\" This will be the answer if you question about\ncaste to a man of any party. Everybody says this because\nthey need the grace of the Brahmins and the north-Indians.\n[Viduthalai, 15-9-1956]\nDepressed Classes\nWhen I said that only the Depressed Classes had got\ncommunal representation and the Backward Classes had not\ngot it, the Depressed Classes feel that we are against them. I\nfeel that I have done a lot for the Adi Dravidars. Yet, they\nsay that the Brahmins are better, and that they face\ndifficulties only due to the caste-Hindus. This is ingratitude!\nWho has brought them to this status? Brahmins? Only\ndue to our demonstration and agitations they have got it\n(communal representation). Only we have shown them the\nway to education. We were the first one to fight for entry\ninto the roads around the temple. If they are educated, or\noccupying nice posts, or serve as ministers, it is not due to\nBrahmins. I do not expect gratitude from them, what I\nexpect is no enmity.\n[Viduthalai, 21-9-1956]\nBrahmin domination\nIt is all right even if we lose our life or get ten years\npunishment, we will suffer it. But our disgrace must be\neradicated. Why are we low caste in our country? Why are\nthey high caste?\nDoes a man of another race rule any other country in\nthis world? A crowd that came to beg, who only number 2\nof 100, should they rule? Should they get jobs? If we ask\nthis, they say, \"Why do you separate the Tamilian and the\nnorth-Indian? Is everybody not a child of the Bharat Mata\n(Mother India)?\" If that is so, how many husbands does\nBharat Mata have? If there are Brahmins, Vaishyas, Sudras,\nand Panchamas, what do we say about the morality of that\nwoman? Does a Brahmin women break stone anywhere?\n\n282\n\n\fDoes she scavenge? Does she sweep the streets? Then how\ndo we say that everybody is the child of Bharat Mata?\nLet it come through law that there shall be no Paraiyan\nor Panchama or Sudra in this country. Will it come? If it\ncomes, what work is there for our party and us? In order to\nget rid of the disgrace that has been imposed on us, we need\nto do whatever has to be done. Everyday our people should\nincrease their feeling, \"Am I a low born? Am I a coolie?\"\nThis fifth circle is a part of the Chennai city: The people\nhere are Paraiyars. A low caste. All those who reside in\nMylapore, Tiruvelikeni, T. Nagar are Brahmins. Can this\ndifference exist? But it is there. Why?\nWho is Pundit Nehru who rules our nation today? Who\nis this Rajaji? Nehru's granddad was a priest. Rajaji and his\nfather and his granddad and his race come to our homes talk\nof thithi, thivasam, karumadhi, kaledupu (rituals related\nwith death, in order to ensure that the dead ancestor reaches\nheaven) and if we had not put money on their plates could\nthey have become India's Prime Minister, Governor\nGeneral, President? It is enough if we realize this. Their\nrace will be eradicated. We have a series of plans. If all this\ndoes not work, finally there is no option but the sword.\nTo attain our successes, even if we sacrifice our life, we\nneed to achieve it. Is it democracy if the majority works as a\ncoolie, and the minority rules?\n[Viduthalai, 05-10-1956]\nBrahmin domination\nI created the Self-Respect movement. I campaign that caste\nmust be annihilated. Today, in reality, there are only two\ncastes. One is the Brahmin caste; the other is the Sudra\ncaste. One is the caste of the master; the other is the caste of\nthe slave.\n'If all these Sudra castes unite, our situation will\nbecome horrible'-so Brahmins divided this one caste into\nChakkiliyan, Paraiyan, Chettiar, Mudaliar, but in reality\nthere are only two castes. In the Manu dharma,\nMahabharata, Ramayana, Sastras etc. only these two castes\n\n283\n\n\fare mentioned. That is, the master caste and the slave caste.\nThe Brahmin will not plough; he will not come and work as\na constable. All the disgraceful work, that is, all the work\nwere one must say \"O' Master\" is for us. The work of\n[authoritatively] calling us \"Dey!\" is for them. No risk must\ncome for this arrangement so he is giving trouble carefully.\nWhen I see all this, what Swaraj or nonsense! Whether the\nwhite man rules, or the Russian rules, or the Chinese rules,\nit is okay; I feel that this north Indian and Brahmin must be\nannihilated. From now, we must not get afraid; we have\nmajor work to be done. I wonder why we need to fight for\npetty reasons. What will happen if we violate the order and\nhold a meeting in this Island Grounds? We will be punished\nfor eight days. Can we not do it?\nThe 'tear drops' of our party get wages from the\nBrahmins and they say that only 'Brahminism' is not\nneeded. The leader of the communists is a Brahmin,\nlikewise the Socialists. We need not even ask about the\nCongress. They never help us.\n[Viduthalai, 7-10-1956]\nReligion and caste\nCaste must be annihilated. Religion, which supports castes,\nmust also be annihilated. The basis of this religion like\npuranas, Sastras must be annihilated. Brahma, Vishnu,\nRudra, Yama, Vayu who keep us as Sudras are not Gods.\nThey are Gods of the Brahmins. Ask a Turk or Christian or\npeople of other religions. They have only one God.\n\"If you have the belief that there is no form, it must be\nin your heart. If you believe it even a little, fear god and act\nwith honesty. Why do we need Gods with several forms?\nMoreover, God who says that we are Sudras, Panchamas, 4th\nor 5th caste, the several Gods, gods with forms, why gods\nwith women, children, gods who demand food-all these\nneed to be destroyed. Only then caste will be destroyed.\nMan's superstitions and foolishness about god will be\ndestroyed. Who worries about all this?\n\n284\n\n\fI say as it is: to go for a job, education and degree are\nnot required. \"Education is not there, mark is not there,\nqualification and merit have gone;\" shouting hoarse over\nthis is deception. We are giving 15% representation for Adi\nDravidars. How many of them have been educated? How\nmuch marks and merit and qualification do they have? What\nhas happened because they have been given representation?\nNo one has complained so far. Only we fought for them.\nWhen the Adi Dravidars are given 15%, must not those who\nare more eligible than them be given their due percentage?\nIf the power is in our hands, there will be no jobs like\npulling carts and breaking stones where the toil involved is\nhigh.\nEven I have gone to foreign countries like Portugal,\nFrance and Russia. The people there don't do such work.\nEverything is mechanized. Only machines do even the work\nof transferring sacks to vehicles. Here railways, income tax\nand other profitable enterprises are given to north-Indians\nand we have to live along with the sales tax. And when they\nneed money, they take it like alms and thus run the\ngovernment. This year I have planned several important\nagitations. Real agitations take place often. You should\nsupport it.\n[Viduthalai, 10-10-1956]\nCommunal Representation\nHow is it fair if Muslims, Christians and Malayalees join\ntogether with Brahmins and stomp our heads? During the\nBritish rule, Muslims and we were as intimate as brothers.\nBy canceling proportional rights, they caused trouble. If\nthere are three people in the Public Service Commission,\nshould one of them be Muslim and another a Christian? We\nshould certainly get communal representation. It is said in\nthe Constitution that Adi Dravidars should be given 15%\nrepresentation. This is a Public Service Commission order;\na copy of it even came to the training school that I run. I am\nhappy; I will give as it is. What is the way for us? What\ndoes it mean if efficiency is demanded in our matter alone?\nWhy was it written in the Constitution that Backward\n\n285\n\n\fclasses and Depressed Classes need to be given\nconcessions? Why was efficiency not demanded then? The\nAdi Dravidas are a community without 5% literacy and\nwhich industry was spoiled because it gave them jobs?\nWhat will be ruined, if all of us are given representation as\nper our proportion in the population?\n[Viduthalai, 14-10-1956]\nHinduism as a religion\nIn foreign countries, there is no social difference that one\nperson is high and another is low by virtue of birth. So they\nare qualified to talk about political and economic equality.\nHere they have abandoned the task that needs to be done\nfirst and instead they keep talking about this and that. There\nis no one to talk about caste or religion. That is why I am\ntaking efforts for social equality and annihilation of caste,\nwhich others have abandoned, and there is nobody to talk\nabout it. As I keep observing the world, I lose interest in\nother things.\nIn this invitation you have used the words \"Reform in\nHindu Religion.\" There is no religion called Hindu religion.\nIn the British period, they did not accept that a religion\nknown as Hinduism existed. While describing electoral\nconstituencies they named it Muslim constituencies for\nMuslims and Christian constituencies for Christians.\nOtherwise, they did not call it the Hindu constituency for\nthose who claim themselves to be Hindus. They called it\nNon-Muslim constituency even in the printed nomination\nform. The British asked, \"How is someone a Hindu? What\nis the evidence?\" Today, what is the evidence for Hindu\nreligion? Other religions have evidence; there are historical\nevidences. Muslim means they can show with historical\nproof that their religious head Muhammad was born in this\nplace, in this year, he did this and so on. There is history\nand proof to say that Jesus was born 1956 years ago, he did\nthis, and he said this. But what proof do those who speak of\nHindu religion have?\n[Viduthalai, 11-11-1956]\n\n286\n\n\fEradication of Brahmins\nEven I want a good government. Only after me, the others\ncame to the Congress; Kamaraj was then my volunteer in\nCoimbatore Those who were ordinary people when I was\nthe President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee are\nministers today. Can I not become a minister if I want to?\nThey are not going to have a loss even if I steal money.\nThey will give me the Minister's post.\nIf I come away who will do these work?\nRajagopalachari carries a counter campaign that if caste is\neradicated, the nation will get spoilt. No Brahmin should be\nthere in this nation. The word Brahmin should not be there\nin the dictionary. The stories of Ravanan, Soorapadman etc.\nwere created to threaten you that you shall meet their fate\nfor having opposed the Brahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 23-11-1956]\nKings and Brahmins\nThis situation came about because all the kings of this\ncountry, Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Naickars were all\nhenchmen of the Brahmins. Having a little bit of shame, if\nthey had chased away Brahmins, the Brahmin would have\nrun away. Instead of that, they kept the Brahmin as guru and\ndid oblations, sacrifices and rituals and gave away their\nwealth to the Brahmins. Thus they remained slaves of the\nBrahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 27-12-1956]\nKings and Brahmins II\nWhat was the integrity of our kings? There was a king\ncalled Vallala Maharaja. A Brahmin came and said that he\nwanted a woman. He searched everywhere in the village.\nHe did not get a woman. He wondered how he could say to\na Brahmin that there was no woman? So he called his wife\nand asked her to be with the Brahmin. It seems this is a holy\nstory. If they had shame or respect should they not have torn\nthis and set it afire?\n\n287\n\n\fCaste is not connected with us. We don't know how we\naccepted it? The word 'Jati' (caste) is not a Tamil word.\nThere is no word in Tamil for that.\n[Viduthalai, 28-12-1956]\nBuddhism\nThere is no religion like Buddhism. There are only a few\ndoctrines that the Buddha said. These are realized because\nof intelligence. To follow those doctrines there is no\nnecessity to go out of Hinduism. Everything that\nDr.Ambedkar said that he didn't believe in or wouldn't\npractice on joining Buddhism, we already don't believe it or\npractice it. We don't believe in moksha (salvation), hell, fate\nand 7, 8 births. We don't have faith in it, we do our work:\nthere is no necessity to go out of Hinduism in order to tell\nthis. No Brahmin can say that we are not Hindu just because\nwe say that caste-which exists according to the\nVarnashrama religion-must be annihilated.\n[Viduthalai, 28-12-1956]\nBuddhism II\nNow Buddha's doctrines have become like a religion. Just\nlike the Muslims have an identity, likewise in countries like\nBurma and Ceylon the Buddhists also have an identity.\nThey have their temples, they pray kneeling down, and with\nthese identities it has become a religion. I said this to\nAmbedkar, \"If we go there (to Buddhism) fearing the\nBrahmins in this religion, then who can exist with these\nBhikkus?\" If we leave this grip and talk one bad word about\nHinduism tomorrow, blame will be heaped on us.\nWe are alone worried about this. The others are only\neager to go to the Legislative Assembly. All the parties\ntoday: the communist, socialist, 'tear drops', are all caught\nin the hands of the Brahmins. If one goes to the Legislative\nAssembly itself, automatically only the love for the\nBrahmins comes inside them. Why? Publicity is the reason\nbecause the newspapers are only in the hands of Brahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 29-12-1956]\n\n288\n\n\fRepresentative of Depressed Classes\nI speak as a public worker; I am ready to make any sacrifice\nfor the Depressed Classes and Sudras. I talk as a\nrepresentative of all of you and not for self-esteem.\n[Statement filed in the Madras High Court, 23-4-1957]\nCaste discrimination in burial grounds\nRight from the inception of the Self-Respect Movement in\n1926, we have been saying, \"The Brahmins, who enslave\nus, must be destroyed. Along with destroying Sastras,\npuranas and epics created by Brahmins, the Gods on whose\nnames they fatten themselves must be broken and roads\nmust be laid with those stones.\"\nIf we look a little earlier, I quit the Congress in 1924\nand I have been writing with great clarity. Not only have I\nwritten that no man should have a title or status in the name\nof his caste and that if the caste name is there in the puranas\nand Sastras it should be destroyed but also I have spoken so\nin several meetings and through resolutions in conferences.\nWe (the Self-Respecters and the Dravidian movement)\nare doing this continuously and no one can consider that we\nhave suddenly begun it today.\nWhen I went to offer flowers and pay homage to the\nmemorial of Comrade Pattukottai Alagiri, I found in that\nburial ground it was embossed stones demarcated the place\nwhere the Sudras were burnt, where Brahmins were burnt,\nwhere the Saurashtras were burnt. On seeing it, I asked\nthem for how long this had existed. They said that is was\nthere from the time of the Tanjore Raja. I asked them to\nwrite to the Municipality to remove these plaques and said\nthat if they refuse to do so, we could take the necessary\naction. Perhaps they immediately passed a resolution and it\nwas immediately removed. I say this because it is\nworrisome to see the names that disgrace us.\n[Viduthalai, 5-5-1957]\n\n289\n\n\fRevolution\nStatues of the British remaining in this country are itself\nconsidered harmful to self-respect and welfare of our\ncitizens and agitations are instigated against it. What wrong\ncan be there in the agitations against the Brahmins who are\nthousand times more harmful, unnecessary and troublesome\nto the indigenous people of the country than the British? Is\nthe democratic rule a rule for the majority? Or is it causing\ntrouble, shame and snatching away rights in the name of the\nminority? They can call it the rule of the mighty. I am afraid\nthat if the government does not act with honesty and\nintelligence in this agitation, that affects the Tamil people's\nself-respect and feeling, people will be constrained to start a\nbloody revolution.\nA bloody revolution might require several people to die.\nDid Pakistan which sacrificed and killed peoples in tens of\nthousands get annihilated? Or has that society disappeared?\n[Viduthalai, 11-05-1957]\nCaste identity\nIn those days people would see the other's ears, count the\npiercings and find out ones caste through that. Because the\nfeeling of caste has reduced, they are not able to find out\nnow.\nSo, piercing the ear is only a traditional ritual that\nprotects caste. As education grows, these will be\nautomatically destroyed.\n[Viduthalai, 25-05-1957]\nBrahmin to be called Pappan\nEven if you happen to forget, the word Brahmin must not\ncome out of your mouth. Call them \"Paappan\", \"Iyan\" and\ndon't call them Brahamanan (Brahmins). Only the 'tear\ndrops' will use the word Brahmin and not any other word.\n[Viduthalai, 30-06-1957]\n\n290\n\n\fBrahmin hotels\nThe 1st of August (1957), must be considered as August\nAgitation Day. On 1st August, from four to eight in the\nevening, in all the villages in Tamil Nadu, in front of\nBrahmin hotels everywhere (whether it is called Brahmin\nHotel or not), our comrades, without causing any hindrance\nto the traffic or to people in a public place, with peace and\nin a compromising manner tell them,\n\"Sir, this hotel is a Brahmin's hotel. This caste has\nruined our life and our society. They cheat us and without\neffort they exploit us, they fatten and call us Sudra, son of a\nprostitute, Paraiyan, Chakkili, Chandala, low caste and so\non. They have written so in their laws, Sastras, ithihasas and\nVeda puranas and are treating us likewise. To go and eat\nfood in this Brahmin hotel is a disgrace for us! It is a great\ndisgrace! Shameless, base disgrace! Sir, please do not go\nthere.\"\nYou should fold your hands, bow down and beg them\nand see that they go back. You must also print pamphlets\nand distribute.\n[Viduthalai, 23-07-1957]\nAnnihilation of caste\nShow me one God of the Tamilians who has a Tamil name?\nWhy does God have a marriage, a wife and children? We\nmust look at God with intelligence; why does God with a\ncompassionate heart require many weapons, bow, sticks and\nsword? God who is the embodiment of morality has been\nmade so vulgar. Why?\nThe Brahmins have written a lot of puranic vulgarity\nand thus spoilt morality. Intelligence and honour are\nrequired for the annihilation of caste. This is very essential\nfor people. In any way, caste has to be annihilated. For the\nsake of our food, for how long do we need to suffer as\ncoolies, labourers, and physical toilers? Should we keep\ndoing our hereditary jobs?\nIf caste is annihilated, we will develop, and our standard\nof living will also develop. So, somehow, in this period, we\n\n291\n\n\fneed to destroy caste. Even in pictures Brahmins should not\nexist. We did not get proportional share in employment or\neducation. In the Government our people are there in jobs of\npeon and police! Only Brahmins occupy the prime jobs\nwhere one can stay comfortable and draw large salaries!\nJobs should be given community-wise proportionally.\n[Viduthalai, 25-07-1957]\nCaste Annihilation Struggle\nThat day the opposition parties could not remove the\nhereditary occupation education scheme. The Dravidar\nKazhagam could do it. I said this to prove that though they\nsay that they will go to the Legislative Assembly and do\nsomething, nothing can be done by going to the Legislative\nAssembly. Remaining outside, only the Dravidar Kazhagam\nworks for the people. All the others can go to the\nLegislative Assembly and earn salaries of Rs.150, Rs.500\nand they cannot do anything else. Even if they rise up to\nspeak, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly will ignore\nthem. In this country, only our party says that caste should\nbe destroyed; the Dravidar Nadu should be partitioned; the\nnorth Indian must quit; God, Sastras, and tradition must be\ndestroyed and works towards these. The people of other\nparties will speak beautifully to get votes. Also, the\nnewspapers of this nation, with restrictions do not write\nabout our activities. Even if they write, they will publish it\nin some corner where nobody can see it. Till now more than\n300 people who participated in the caste eradication\nagitation have been arrested and punished. But, no\nopposition party has questioned it. Only the Dravidar\nKazhagam lives without the grace of Brahmins,\ngovernment, publicity or newspapers.\nThis year we are going to do two agitations:\n1. caste annihilation struggle\n2. Tamils should do pooja in the temples instead of\nBrahmins.\nThe first struggle is the Caste Annihilation struggle that\nis to take place in Chennai as a hotel blockade agitation. I\n\n292\n\n\fhave planned to do this Caste Annihilation struggle for one\nyear.\n[Viduthalai, 27-7-1957]\nDestruction of Brahmins\nAs far as I am concerned, only I destroyed caste. In those\ndays, I ate in the homes of those who weaved mattresses.\nSomehow caste became bitter for me! In my house they\nwould not let me inside the kitchen. My mother would not\ntouch me till her death. They will take the tumbler I drank\nwater in, turn it upside down and sprinkle water over it.\nThey were so orthodox. Without any worry I ate in the\nhomes of Muslims and Vaaniya Chettiars.\nEarlier caste identity was there. I am responsible for its\ndisappearance. After I die, people will again go and fall in\nthe Brahmin's feet. For the last twenty years, like me who\nhas been running Kudiarasu, Pagutharivu, Viduthalai, SelfRespect Movement? Even the Congress, has it followed one\ndoctrine for thirty years? Only the Dravidar Kazhagam\nworks for a single doctrine. How was our life forty years\nago? Were not the Adi Dravidars unable to go to schools?\nWe said that schools that didn't enroll Adi Dravidars would\nnot get the grant. Only after that they enrolled...\nOnly if the Brahmin is destroyed, caste will be\ndestroyed. The Brahmin is a snake entangled in our feet. He\nwill bite. If you take off your leg, that's all. Don't leave.\nBrahmin is not able to dominate because power is in the\nhand of the Tamilian.\n[Viduthalai, 30-07-1957]\nDisfiguring Gandhi's statue\nKamaraj and I are very intimate. Can Kamaraj not destroy\ncaste in one sentence? \"Both of them spoke beforehand and\nthey have done so,\" these 'tear drops' are doing a negative\ncampaign against us.\nYou think over this! More than us, only for Kamaraj,\ncaste must be destroyed. Only he should have total desire\nand effort. If the Minister's post goes, Kamaraj is only a\n\n293\n\n\fNadar. If this land comes in the hand of a Brahmin he will\nnot even call Kamaraj as Nadar. He will only be called\nsaanan! Does he not know that?\nIn our country's Constitution, there is no space to\ndestroy caste. One should not consider that caste has been\ndestroyed just because a Paraiyan is able to enter a hotel and\na temple. Gandhi did this conspiracy to create such an\nappearance. What will be their state after the privileges\ngiven to them now are fulfilled? The world does not know\nof the caste system that exists in our country. But no\nnewspaper or news agency can hide from the world\nGandhi's photograph being burnt or his statue being broken.\n\"Caste is there in India. Brahmin is the head of the\ncastes in India. He is also the head in politics, finance, and\nsociety. Gandhi saved the Brahmin society. He made the\nother communities slaves of the Brahmins. That cruelty is\nunbearable. The people of the south break the statues of\nGandhi. Nehru is unable to rectify it.\"-The world will\nknow this. Nehru cannot fly as the peace ambassador in\ninternational politics. I will certainly create this situation.\n[Viduthalai, 03-10-1957]\nGandhi's assassination\nGandhi calculated the number of almonds that he ate. He\nsaid that he would live for 120 years. But the Brahmins shot\nhim dead. If the same thing happens to me, what do we\nknow? Beyond all that, who knows how many more days I\nwill live? Doctors say that as far as the body is concerned I\nam fit. When I see the people's affection, I get the\nenthusiasm that I should live for some more time.\n[Viduthalai, 7-10-1957]\nPress\nOutsiders can know information about us only if it comes in\nour own newspaper. Without the favor of other press\npeople, only we, only our doctrine is gaining importance in\nthe country. Once, in one of my demonstrations, I said that\nthe dailies or magazines have to be slaves to the Brahmins\n\n294\n\n\ffor their existence, so they write like this. The journalists\nare either Brahmins or those who need a living. In foreign\ncountries, newspapers are run for ideology. Here it is not so.\nIf it is news about us, no one will publish it. Anyone else\nwould have become influential at the mercy of the\nnewspapers.\nOnly the press elevated Gandhi. I know that he is an\nordinary man. For the welfare of the Brahmins, the\njournalists elevated him and made him a Mahatma. I spoke\nto Vinobha Bhave for more than an hour. He is nothing, just\na mad man.\nI say this because we are the only people who have\nbecome significant on our own because of our ideology and\nwithout favor of the press.\nComrades! You must listen carefully. Even if anyone\nelse reports our news, he would only put it in such a way\nthat it makes you hate us. So, you need to pay attention.\nWhy should caste be there? Why should there be high\nand low? Why are we so low to the extent that we should\ndrink the water that was used to wash the Brahmin's feet?\nEven today he buys the water in which Sankaracharya's feet\nare washed and drinks it. What an atrocity! Must this\nhappen in 1957? Why should the Dravidian race be Sudras?\n[Viduthalai, 07-10-1957]\nBreaking Gandhi's statue\nThey have made arrangements in the law to protect caste.\nGandhi was the basic reason for doing so.\nThey are able to make arrangements to protect caste,\nonly in the name of Gandhi; so I will say it is a great shame\nfor Gandhi's statue to remain in this country.\nWe have the right to break Gandhi's statue.\nToday the Congressmen say that the statue of\nWellington must not be there, the statue of Queen Victoria\ncannot be there, Neelan's statue must not be there!\nLikewise, I have the right to say that Gandhi's statue must\nnot be there in our Tamil Nadu.\n\n295\n\n\fGandhi has committed the atrocities that Wellington\nand Neelan did not commit.\nGandhi cheated us whole-heartedly, made a strong law\nto protect caste, gave protection to the Brahmins, and made\narrangements for us to remain slaves forever.\n[Viduthalai, 08-10-1957]\nGandhi and Untouchability\nDr.Ambedkar has written a book. Gandhi's deception has\nbeen brought about nicely in it. That book is \"What\nCongress and Gandhi have done for the Untouchables?\"\nThey have an organization to eradicate untouchability\ncalled the \"Untouchable League.\" They have also given lots\nof funds. They appointed a committee for this league. One\nof the Committee members while speaking said,\n\"Community inter-dining must take place; caste must be\neradicated; only then untouchability will go.\" The other\nmembers did not like this so they complained about it to\nGandhi.\nSo Gandhi released a statement regarding that. What\nstatement? \"The eradication of untouchability and caste do\nnot have a connection; inter-dining is different and\neradication of untouchability is different.\" This was\nGandhi's statement. After hearing this, that particular\ncommittee member submitted his resignation. After this\nGandhi wrote in Young India, \"Caste system is a good\nstructure; it should be there; varnashrama should be\nprotected.\"\nWhen I was in the Congress itself, I have spoken a lot\nthat we need equality in the social sector. For all that,\nGandhi said, \"If the Untouchables are not allowed to draw\nwater, build separate wells for them. If they are not allowed\ninto temples, build separate temples for them.\" He also said\nthat he would send the money. At that time, only we\nopposed it. I said, \"If there can be no compensation for the\ndegradation that he cannot draw water from the well, let\nhim die without water. His disgrace should be removed, that\nis important and not water.\"\n\n296\n\n\fWe shouted that we need temple entry. Even Rajaji\nknew that my screams had some respect. We entered the\ntemples taking the Untouchables along with us.\nIn Kerala it became a riot and even a murder took place.\nRajaji told Gandhi, \"Ramasamy's speech is respected. It\nwill become a riot. So, they must be let into the temple.\"\nOnly after that, they said that the Panchama could enter as\nfar as the Sudra was allowed.\nI said, \"The Sudra and the Panchama became one and\nwe became a little lower but the Brahmin is remaining the\nsame. Should caste not be destroyed?\"\nFrom then onwards Gandhi was involved in the effort of\nsaving caste, and he was hand-in-glove with the Brahmins;\nhe committed several frauds and cheated us. Gandhi's\npower was used to make us slaves of the Brahmins, and to\nmake the Brahmins remain Brahmins.\nPeople should know of the fraud that Gandhi did. That\nis why we say that we will burn Gandhi's picture. Gandhi's\nstatue should not be there in our country. It must be\nremoved.\n\"We are surviving in the name of Gandhi. It looks like\nGandhi's honour will be spoilt.\" The Central Government\nmay get the feeling of annihilating caste.\nIf they do not yield even to that, we will take Nehru's\neffigy and drag it (along the streets). If they do not take\naction even then, we need to finally sharpen the plan. Let\nten or hundred people die. Even now they die in\nMudhukalathoor. They only say 30 people die; they do not\nmention which caste they belong to. Cleverly they black out\nthe news. In an honest manner, we try to act without harm.\nIf we cannot, what do we do? In this I had great concern\nthat we should not cause trouble, loss of property, or harm.\nNow there is no other way.\nIf we leave it as it is, will it mean that we have crossed\nhalf the well?\nThey asked us to have an identity in order to let others\nknow of our caste! Sari, jewellery, and the number of\npiercings in the ear: seeing these one could identify the\n\n297\n\n\fcaste! Tomorrow, how long will it take for them to make\nthis practices return.\nAha! If we burn Gandhi's photo they say a bloody riot\nwill take place. Let it take place, what is going to be lost?\nThose who are responsible do not answer. The minister\ndidn't say that it is wrong to burn Gandhi's photo. \"If it is\nburnt, the people's sentiments will be wounded. We will\ntake action so that their sentiment is not affected.\" They\nsaid so and they did not say that it is wrong to burn his\npicture. I just said the mistakes that Gandhi did. Those who\nsay that it must not be burnt, should they not say that he did\nnot commit any mistake? Let them at least say what they\nshould do for caste to be destroyed! Or at least let them say\nthat caste must not be destroyed! Or let them hold a\nreferendum on whether caste must be destroyed or not?\nComrades! We don't have any other work now. Even\nwe feel difficult about this. Whether we lose, or die, or go to\nthe gallows, we need to get ready for the caste annihilation\nwar. This is not to speak in arrogance; this is a matter\nrelating to 100% of the people. If we leave this opportunity,\nthere is no other. So, there is no use in worrying about 10100 people dying.\nI am 79 years old. I want to die for this issue.\nThey say that Hindi is going to come again. \"It will not\ncome. If it comes, we will burn the Government's flag.\"\nOnly Gandhi said that the Varnashrama Dharma must\nbe protected. In 1927 itself I wrote, \"To protect the title of\nMahatma, Gandhi has become a slave of the Brahmins.\"\nEven from that time I only used to write Comrade Gandhi,\nnot Mahatma. Later we called him Gandhiar (a respectful\nsuffix) and not Mahatma. Gandhi has done a major harm in\nthe social set-up.\n[Viduthalai, 09-10-1957]\nGandhi and Untouchability II\nWhen Gandhi and the Congress spoke of the eradication of\nuntouchability, people were fooled into believing that it was\ncaste annihilation! They were careful to say that\n\n298\n\n\funtouchability was wrong, but at the same time they said\nthat varnashrama dharma, that is the caste system must be\nprotected as it is. Accordingly they made arrangements and\nfound protection even through the law. Gandhi did not like\ncaste annihilation.\nThe eradication of untouchability is a sham, I have\nwritten so in the Kudiarasu in 1925. In other states also,\nDr.Ambedkar, Shanker Nair and others have strongly\ncondemned the slyness of Gandhi through writing and\nspeeches.\nI also said that I know Gandhi very well. I know Gandhi\nbetter than Jinnah and Ambedkar know him. I say this\nmainly because people should not blindly follow Gandhi.\nEveryone should know that Gandhi has cheated us. Only\nbecause of Gandhi all the people of good morals have been\nbanished and people have become cheats and dishonest\npersons for the sake of their living. Even after 10 years of\nindependence, the differences like Brahmin, Sudra, Paraiyar\nand so on exist. The Independence Day that we are going to\ncelebrate is a celebration only for the selfish, cunning\npeople with a comfortable living that they achieved by\ncheating Sudras and Paraiyars.\n[Viduthalai, 13-8-1957]\nSepoy Mutiny and Caste\nIf the Tamil kings had possessed a grain of self-respect, will\nthe people of this country have remained tribals and low\ncaste for 2000 to 3000 years? Did any king think that\nincluding himself, 90% of the people are low caste and\ndegraded? Is there any evidence for this?\nThere is history that the Buddhists and Jains who\nstruggled to teach our people good behaviour and\nknowledge were tortured, impaled, and butchered by the\nTamil kings which only shows that our country was ruled\nby barbaric tyrants.\nThe revolt of 1857 (Sepoy Mutiny: First Indian War of\nIndependence) did not actually take place against the\n\n299\n\n\fdomination of British in the subcontinent or the rule of\nforeigners is clearly evident from the present activities.\nThe reformation carried out by Lord Dalhousie ensured\nthat everyone in the country was able to get the benefit of\neducation that was the monopoly of Brahmins. The\nintroduction of railways, steam engine, telegraph and other\nscientific methods made the orthodox caste people angry.\nThey feared that such type of intellectual education would\ncertainly shake their domination. They contemplated, \"What\nhas to be done to destroy these acts and policies?\" They\ndiscovered that these poor uneducated sepoys were\northodox by nature and accordingly frightened them by\nsaying that the British are trying to eradicate caste and\nreligion, so they made them enemies.\nThe reformation and spread of scientific education\nwould change the caste system that inculcated low caste\npeoples' slavish mentality and respect for Brahmins. So due\nto their selfishness, Brahmins instigated the Sepoys by\nfalsely alleging that animal fat was smeared as grease on the\ncartridges and given to them. They informed to Hindu\nsepoys that cow's fat was used and to Muslim sepoys that\npig's fat was smeared. Thus religious superstitions were\nused to bring about misunderstanding and dispute.\nThis nation's independence lies only in setting the\nfoolish poor against the rich; but it has no capacity to\nquestion God, Sastras, laws or the people who made some\npeople as 'low caste' and treated them disgracefully worse\nthan dogs and pigs.\nCan a Brahmin, Sudra, Paraiyar or Chakkiliyar exist in\nan independent nation? Can such a nation be an independent\nnation or a 'hell' nation? Do we have any right to struggle\nand eradicate this? Is there anyway to demand our right?\nThe human beings of this independent nation are made\nslaves and fools by the Brahmins who are our ministers and\nleaders.\nSo, can this be an independent nation by writing about\nindependence? I only feel angered, so I stop writing here.\n[Viduthalai, 15-8-1957]\n\n300\n\n\fBurning the Constitution\nThey say that if a Brahmin needs a job, the qualification is\nnot important, only the confidence is important. If our\nperson is going to get that job, then they say only\nqualification is important. You must think about all this.\nWhat qualification? If Adi Dravidars are given 15%\nwithout looking into their qualifications, which job that they\ndid was spoilt? Is it not mischievous to say that if they give\nthe jobs that have not been ruined because of the Adi\nDravidars to us, as per proportion, then it will be ruined?\nOur first work is to burn the Constitution; after 2-3\nmonths we will wait and see, and burn Gandhi's picture; if\nthey don't rectify even after that we will remove Gandhi's\nstatue, if that doesn't work out, we will drag Nehru's effigy,\nlater (Rajendra) Prasad's (president's) effigy, if that doesn't\nwork out and the honest methods don't work out, then we\nneed to go to war. Let a thousand people die! Are they not\ndying madly in Mudhukalathoor now? Only if it goes to that\nextent, something might happen.\n[Viduthalai, 12-10-1957]\nBurning the Constitution\nThere is not a needle size of good for us in the Constitution.\nThere are rights in it only for the north Indians to loot. It has\nmade way for the Brahmin to forever remain a Brahmin.\nSo, first the Constitution must be burnt. According to\nthis law, the Paraiyan will exist as long as this world exists.\nBut, he wouldn't be under the name Paraiyan, but under the\nname Harijan. What is the difference whether we call it a\nbroomstick or a sweeping device? Provisions have been\nmade in the Constitution for Brahmin, Sudra and Paraiyan\nto exist as long as the world exists.\nThe Legislative Assembly does not have the power to\nmake a law about caste annihilation. Only the Central\nGovernment has the right to amend the Constitution. If such\nan amendment is going to come 251 people must vote for it.\nIf they are going to consider it, two-thirds of the members\n\n301\n\n\fmust support it. Even for consideration, this is the state. Is it\npossible? Only five people made the law. To make it, five\npeople are enough. But so much of mess to change it. What\ncan we do in this?\nNow, fights take place in Mudhukalathoor in the name\nof caste. Some say it is due to election. Election also takes\nplace on the basis of caste, so numerous murders occur!\nMany villages have been gutted down by fire. Where is the\nstrength for Adi Dravidars? For how long would they have\nfought with potency? One or two of them could have beaten\nothers. But thousands of them would have only got beaten.\nLet this go anyway.\nThey revolt saying that five people died of police firing.\nLet five people have been shot dead. Because of that,\nseveral lives were saved and the carnage was contained. If\nthey cite this and say that Kamaraj must be destroyed, what\ndoes it mean? What could have been done if Rajaji had been\nthere? What could have been done if anyone else was there?\nThe opposition party is there only to destroy the ruling\nparty. Otherwise, what work of integrity does it do? How is\nit justifiable if they irresponsibly speak in a manner in\nwhich the carnage will be instigated again?\nComrades! This cruel state should change. Caste must\nbe destroyed.\nNext, several agitations should take place. You must\nsupport this. Under any condition, I request our people not\ngo to Brahmin hotels.\n[Viduthalai, 13-10-1957]\nAnnihilation of caste\nOnly the Dravidar Kazhagam says that caste should be\nannihilated. Even the communist doesn't ask, \"Why caste?\nWhy so many Gods? Why does God require a wife?\"\nBecause majority of the people are poor, he will get votes\nonly if he scolds the rich. That is their doctrine.\nThe Congress is a big party. Even he will not ask,\n\"Why?\" In the Constitution itself they have given the\npromise that they will protect caste. If they don't say, how\n\n302\n\n\fwill the 'tear-drops' say? Comrades! The Dravidar\nKazhagam is doing work that no one has come forward to\ndo and where several people have been destroyed for\ncoming forward. If we see whether caste can be annihilated\nthrough the law, through the Parliament, one has to be\nafraid that it is not possible.\nIt is possible only if we come to the decision that\nsomething has to be done. At least thousand people should\ndie. Only if thousand people dare to die it is possible. Only\nthen they will conform and ask, \"What should be done?\"\nWe shall tell them, if you had come yesterday, two\nagraharams would have survived.\n[Viduthalai, 13-10-1957]\nSacrifice in struggle\nNo matter how sever the drought, only the proletariats\nsuffer for rice and gruel. The Brahmin would eat rice and\nghee in a tender plantain leaf! What labour does he do? A\nyoung Brahmin boy will see an old man (of a lower caste)\nand (disrespectfully) call him 'Hey!' Who thought of it? If I\ndie, there will be no one to question, \"Why the Brahmins?\"\nWithout any reason, they are dying madly in\nMudhukalathoor! They can stab a Brahmin coming in front\nof them and question, \"Why are you a Brahmin?\" Let a\nthousand of us go to the gallows. Yesterday, how many\npeople died in the rail accident?\nThe cyclone came. How many people died? Let them\nperish like that. For every ten Brahmins, two of our people.\nWhat is the loss? Let our children at least remain humans.\nWill the Brahmin come on his own accord and say that\nhe will go? Only you have to question him. If it happens\nlike Mudhukalathoor in two villages it is enough. If we\nannounce the date it is enough. He will run away! I am not\naddressing this at the old people. I am not addressing this at\nthose who go to the Legislative Assembly. I am not saying\nthis looking at those who fatten up in the name of public\nservice. I say this looking at the proletariat and at the youth.\n[Viduthalai, 15-10-1957]\n\n303\n\n\fCall to Arms\nWe need to do a great revolution to change this. Not a\nrevolution through the mouth. We must take the sword and\nfight. In front of our eyes itself Jinnah fought. He took the\nsword. He asked, \"Why should we, who are 90% of the\npopulation, get stuck with the Hindus?\" After the river of\nblood flowed, they went to his house and gave him\nPakistan. Today, it is a powerful country. Nehru is\nshivering! The reason is that they were brave. They have\nonly one leader. They behaved as per their leader's word. If\nour people are also obedient, we can very soon attain our\naims.\n[Viduthalai, 17-10-1957]\nStruggle to annihilate caste\nThey stay behind us and say Periyar, Periyar. They get on\nthe stage, speak four words and if two people clap hands\nthey say that they have difference of opinion with me and\nrun away. They go to the Legislative Assembly. We are\nstruggling incessantly in the midst of traitors. Who knows\nthe kind of service we are doing?\nAs the first step, we will burn the Constitution. Then\nfifteen days time. If the Government does not budge, we\nwill burn Gandhi's photo because it was he who he created\na situation for the making of a law and cheated us. Then, we\nwill wait for fifteen more days. Then we will uproot all the\nGandhi statues. Shoot ten people, put them is jail, and the\nworld will know. The world will come to know of the\ncruelties of caste system. Even if that does not heed results,\nwe will drag the effigy of Nehru. If nothing happens, we\nhave to risk our lives. If that much emotion comes, caste\nwill certainly be annihilated. It should come to that extent.\nLet them hang 100 people. In Mudhukalathoor, without\nany use forty people have died because of caste. They have\nburnt many homes. If this takes place for a useful/necessary\npublic work, what is the loss? I ask for all your signatures.\nThousands of you must give your name. If I do anything, I\n\n304\n\n\fwill inform you and only then do it. I will not do it secretly\nand then cry foul.\nTill now, at least 30 cases would have come against me.\nIn any one of the cases I did not scold a witness or ask a\ncross-question! I have never thought that I could escape by\nengaging an advocate. If they question me I would say,\n\"Yes I did so.\" I would not say anything else. When we do\nanything, we do it knowingly. We do it with the knowledge\nthat we will be punished. \"Did you do?\" \"Yes, I did.\" This\npunishment is correct. That's all.\nSo comrades! Instead of considering this as a play,\nconsider it a great work and think of your participation.\nNow 400 people have signed in blood-women have also\nsigned-that they will do whatever they are asked to do.\nThere is no need to worry about money. Now they are going\nto give money equivalent to my weight, so seven thousand\nrupees will come. Am I going to spend it on myself? If need\narises, and there is no other way, that money will be used to\nannihilate at least ten Brahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 19-10-1957]\nBrahmin hypocrisy\nThe Brahmin will instigate the Paraiyar against the\nPadayatchi by saying, \"Look, he is calling you a Paraiyan.\"\nHe will also instigate the Padayatchi against the Paraiyan.\nWhen both of them are wrestling in the ground, he will pass\nhis time without any dirt touching his nails.\nIn this age, why should caste be there? What is the\nnecessity for a community to be a low caste and lead a low\nlife? This must be pondered upon.\n[Viduthalai, 16-10-1957]\nBurning the Constitution\nLet the Government say that it will not allow the caste of\nBrahmin to exist in the Constitution and even if it exists, we\nwill not allow him to lead a life of a Brahmin. That is why I\nburnt the Constitution.\n\n305\n\n\fThe persons who were members of the Constitution\nDrafting Committee are:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nAlladi Krishna Iyer (Brahmin)\nT.T. Krishnamachari (Brahmin)\nN. Gopalasamy Iyengar (Brahmin)\nK.M. Munshi (Brahmin)\nDr. B. R. Ambedkar (Adi Dravida)\nMohammed Sadullah (Muslim)\n\nThey spent 1077 days to make the Constitution. This\nConstitution also applies for the Sudras who are 70% of the\npopulation, there was not even a single Sudra representative\ninvolved in making the Indian Constitution. One can see\nthat there were 4 members for 3% population. That is, 4 out\nof 6 members who drafted the Constitution were Brahmins.\nIn the Constitution, Hindu religion has been given\nprotection. So the castes and caste differences are\ncompletely protected. We have no opportunity to correct it\nor amend it. I am a person who wants to abolish caste so I\ncarry out agitations. That is why I burn the Constitution.\n[Viduthalai, 11-11-1957]\nCaste discriminatory practices\nOur society is based on religion, caste, sub-castes, customs\netc. Caste-Hindus, non-caste Hindus and Panchamas are the\nthree divisions. The Brahmins will not attend the marriages\nof non-caste Hindus and Panchamas. What a difference\nexists in our society!\nNattukkottai Chettiars went to the Privy Council to\nestablish that they cannot be called Sudras and that they are\nalso upper castes. Sudras cannot have marriage rituals or\nproperty or prayers for the dead. That is why if they have to\nget married or offer prayers to god, the officiating Brahmin\npriests puts a holy thread on the Sudra man. This holy\nthread worn by the Sudra is thrown into a river after the\nritual is over.\n[Vazhkai Thunainalam, 1958]\n\n306\n\n\fVaikom agitation\nI was extended an invitation to come over to the\nKanyakumari District many times by your comrades. As I\nwas busily touring in the other districts, I could not come\nearlier. Wherever I toured, I found a great awakening.\nPeople gathered in thousands.\nTen years ago, I addressed a meeting here in\nMarthandam. In those days you were citizens of a Native\nState. You were ruled by a Rajah whereas we were citizens\nof the British Government. Yet we are all \"Sudras.\" We\nDravidians were subjected to humiliation. On the outcome\nof the hoax played on us we continue to be \"Sudras.\"\nToday, we are citizens of one country. We are\nTamilians of Tamilnadu. We are today brought together.\nOur unity is strengthened. We are today linked as one\nfamily because we are all, now-citizens of one country. We\nhave to work together for achieving our ideals as we are all\nclassified under one caste. So far as I am concerned even\nbefore 35 years ago, I led the agitation in Tamilnad to\neradicate the social evils particularly the hateful\n'untouchability'. For over thousand years we were not\nallowed to enter some of the public roads. Those who are\nnow aged at least 50 years may recollect those days.\nYoungsters of this generation may not know these things of\nthe past.\nIf there had not been the agitation in those days, today\nmany of us would not have the right to pass through many\nof the roads. In those days conditions were very bad in this\ncountry. The Government was in the hands of the orthodox\nBrahmins. The Varnashrama Dharma was in its full sway.\nIn our country, the advent of the Non-Brahmin Movement,\nredeemed a number of rights to the Non-Brahmins. The\nNon-Brahmin Movement successfully combated the\nBrahmin domination. That Non-Brahmin Movement was\npopularly known as the Justice Party; named after its\njournal 'Justice'.\n\n307\n\n\fThe Brahmins too had their own organisations as\nBrahmana Samajam, and Brahmana Mahasabha. They\nworked against our interests and stood in the way of our\nattaining many of our legitimate rights. Brahmins were\nproud of calling themselves as 'High caste'. They insisted on\ncalling themselves as 'Brahmins'. Manu law and other\nSastras too termed us as 'Sudras' only. What an amount of\nhumiliation and degradation we were subjected to!\nAs this state of affairs affected name for Dravidar\nKazhagam or Tamilar Kazhagam, we have to choose only\n'Sudra' Kazhagam, as the suitable name for our\norganization.\nThat is why, we had to change the name of the South\nIndian Liberal Federation and the Justice Party as the\nDravidar Kazhagam, to make ourselves known to the world\nas to who we are. The Dravidians are a proud nation, known\nto the world.\nOn account of the efforts taken by the Non-Brahmin\nMovement (Justice Party) in the years 1919 and 1920 and\nthe agitations in my Tamilnadu, the right to make use of all\nroads irrespective of castes, was got, not only in Tamilnadu\nbut also in Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala.\nWith the powers vested in the hands of the Justice Party\nthe right to make use of all roads by all castes was brought\ninto practice. The Justice Party brought in a legislation even\nin those days permitting the so called low-caste people to\nmake use of water from the wells, which had all along been\nexclusively reserved only for the use of the Brahmins.\nThese are all things which took place before the days of\nGandhi. It is absurd and. fraudulent to say that is only\nGandhi who did all these things. Not only this. The Justice\nParty people were the first people to pave the way for all\ncastes to enter the Panchayats, Municipalities. Taluk\nBoards, District Boards and Legislative bodies even before\nthe coming of Gandhi. They nominated the representatives\nof the so called low caste people as the 'Pariahs' to enter the\nlegislatures on a par with the so called high caste 'Pariahs'\n'Chakkilis', 'Pallars', were members of the legislature. I\nwant you all to clearly understand this truth.\n308\n\n\fAs a matter of fact, Gandhi's plans were different. He\nwas not for allowing all the Sudras and Untouchables to\nbale out water from wells and tanks, along with the high\ncaste Brahmins. He was not for permitting the Untouchables\nto enter the temples along with the high caste people.\nOriginally, he only insisted on the continuance of certain\nrights exclusively for the high caste. He upheld the Manu\ncode. He was for separate temples, tanks, wells and\ndwellings for the high caste Brahmins and the low-caste\nSudras. That was the original plan of Gandhi. I know it. Let\nanyone deny. Today, false propaganda is carried on about\nGandhi. Much is said about the Gandhian way and\nGandhian path.\nI was the Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Congress\nCommittee. A sum of Rs.48,000 was sent to Tamilnadu as\ngrant from the AICC, to construct separate schools and\ntemples for the low-caste Sudras as the 'Pariahs', Chakkilis,\nand Pallars. It was strictly ordered that these Untouchables\nshould not go and create trouble at the places exclusively\nused by the high caste Hindus.\nBy that time the Justice Party people had already passed\norders permitting all castes to study in all schools\nirrespective of their castes. They made all study together.\nCaste restrictions were removed in the field of education\nlong ago. This Reform was strictly enforced. There was a\nlaw compelling even private institutions to admit a\npercentage of 'Sudras' in their schools failing which, such\nschools would not be eligible for any Government grant.\nAt the time of inspection the officer would put the\nquestion, \"How many Untouchables are studying in this\ninstitution?\" If anyone should say that no untouchable\napproached seeking admission, the officer would say 'In\nthat case you have got to go and get some Untouchables to\nstudy in your School'. I am telling of the conditions that\nprevailed in our State even before Gandhi came.\nWhen Tamilians were so much progressive, in your\nKanyakumari District things were very bad. The high caste\nHindus did not even tolerate the right of low caste\nuntouchable Hindus. Even his shadow should not fall on the\n\n309\n\n\fso-called high castes. That was the horrible tragedy in your\nplace. The low caste Sudras were to raise a cry from his\nhiding place to reveal his presence. It is on account of the\nlaudable services of Swami Narayana Guru that the low\ncaste Sudras were awakened. The Vaikom Agitation\nchanged the conditions. The Untouchables here gained a lot.\nThese things may not be known to the youngsters here.\nWe waged the battle at Vaikom against untouchability.\nWe were imprisoned many times. We were severely beaten.\nWe were put to disgrace. All these sacrifices we had to\nmake to eradicate untouchability.\nThere were no classes in jail in those days. The\ntreatment was very bad. We had to bear all these to\neradicate untouchability and bring in a new change. How\ndid this change come in? What is our present position? If\nyou think over and search for a better position, you will in\nfact agree that we are very slow in eradicating casteism and\nits evils. We must muster strength and march on with a\ngreater speed.\nYou must know the history of the Vaikom agitation. A\nvery small incident led to the Vaikom agitation.\nComrade Madhavan was an advocate. He was to appear\nbefore the honourable judge in a case on behalf of his client.\nThe court was in the compound of the Maharaja's palace. At\nthat time, arrangements were made to celebrate the birthday\nof Rajah. The entire surrounding of the palace was thatched\nwith Palmyrah leaves beautifully. Brahmins started chanting\nmantras. As Comrade Madhavan belonged to the 'Ezhava'\n(Nadar) community, he was not permitted to enter or pass\nthrough the place and reach the court.\nIt was at this time that the Justice Party was carrying on\npropaganda in Tamil Nadu for the abolition of castes and\nuntouchability Inter-caste marriages were encouraged.\nSchools were thrown open to all. 'Samabandi Bojanam'\n(Inter-dining) was popular. Such intensive social reform\npropaganda was carried on in Tamil Nadu by the Justice\nParty. When Gandhi came to know of what the Justice Party\nwas doing in Tamilnadu he started including our schemes in\nhis constructive programme. In those days, the Justicites\n310\n\n\fboldly exposed the Brahmins who were afraid to move\nabout without company. Non-Brahmin leaders as Dr.\nT.M.Nair and Sir P.Theagarayar educated the masses by\ntheir incessant and extensive propaganda and secured the\npowers in the State. Brahmins were envious of the Justice\nGovernment. They had no platform in those days. In those\ndays, the Brahmins cunningly took shelter under the slogans\n\u2013 'we are not power-mongers. We boycott the elections.'\nWith such false slogans they hoodwinked the people and\nindulged in all sorts of intrigues. Realizing the popularity of\nthe Justice Party, Gandhi concentrated on the problem of\nuntouchability, as the only way to bring down the Justice\nParty rule in Tamil Nadu.\nIn those days I was very familiar to the leaders of the\nJustice Party. They had great respect for me, because I held\nmany posts. Mr. Rajagopalachari met me and induced me to\nbecome a follower of Gandhi. He said that Gandhi alone is\ncapable of carrying out the much-needed social reforms. I\nresigned the post as chairman of Erode Municipality and\njoined the Congress. Before my entering the Congress, no\nTamilian had the honour of becoming the Secretary or\nPresident of the Tamil Nadu Congress. I was the first\nTamilian to hold these posts in the history of Tamilnadu\nCongress.\nCom. T.V. Kalyanasundaram (Thiru Vi.Ka) was a\nschoolmaster. Dr. R Varadarajalu (Naidu) was the editor of\n'Prapancha Mitran'. Yet Brahmins did not trust him. Com.\nV.0. Chidambaram (Pillai) was at the mercy of Mr. Kasturi\nRanga Iyengar, after draining all his resources.\nI already held big posts and hailed from a very big\nbusiness community. For anything and everything\nRajagopalachari believed me and reposed much confidence\nin me. I also believed him and reciprocated the confidence\nhe held in me. We both worked out together and I carried on\nan intensive propaganda; with the result the Brahmins once\nagain gained the platform. I was very bold in expressing the\nrationalist views. I openly spoke on god in all my meetings\nstating, \"If the idol would get polluted by the touch of the\npeople, such a god is not required and the idol has to be\n\n311\n\n\fbroken to pieces and used for constructing good roads.\nOtherwise it may be put near the river banks to be used for\nwashing clothes.\" I was often induced to speak severely by\nthe Brahmins. As I was not for any post or power the\nBrahmins remained silent.\nWhat all I say now about God, religion and caste; I used\nto say even in those days. Rajagopalachari used to tell me\nthat I have administered a very strong dose, after hearing\nmy speeches. I used to reply that so long as people remain\nfoolish, there is no use of our giving a light dose. On\nhearing me he simply smiled. In these ways, we made the\nBrahmins come to power in those days.\nLeaders of the Ezhava community wanted to start an\nagitation, when Mr. Madhavan was objected from entering\nthe court. Mr. K.P.Kesava Menon, President of the Kerala\nCongress Committee, T.K.Madhavan and others took the\nlead. They decided to launch the protest on the day of the\nprayers at the Raja's palace. They chose Vaikom as the fit\nplace for the agitation. It is only in Vaikom you have a\ntemple with four entrances on the four sides, leading to four\nstreets around the temple. That was really convenient for the\nagitation. So they chose Vaikom as the place for the\nagitation.\nThere was a law that -the low caste Untouchables as\n'Avarnasthans' and 'Ayithak Karans' should not enter those\nroads. If an untouchable has to go to the other side of the\ntemple, he had to go two or three furlongs away from the\ntemple and walk about a mile to reach the other side. Even\nthe 'Asaris', Vaniars and Weavers were not allowed to enter\nthe roads around this temple. The same conditions were\nprevalent in other temples also. Particularly at Suchindram\nit was very strictly enforced. Important government offices,\ncourts and police station were by the side of the Vaikom\ntemple near the entrance. Even while transferring officials,\nno untouchable would be transferred to these offices as they\nwere not permitted to enter the roads around the temple.\nEven the coolies were debarred from entering the roads to\nreach the shops.\n\n312\n\n\fAs soon as the Vaikom agitation started the Rajah\nordered about 19 leaders including Advocate Madhavan,\nBarrister Kesava Menon, T.K.Madhavan, George Joseph, to\nbe arrested. They were treated as special prisoners. At that\ntime, there was a European named Mr. Pitt as the I.G. of\nPolice, under the Rajaji's government. He ably managed the\naffairs of the agitators. When all the 19 agitators were put in\nprison, the Vaikom agitation actually fizzled out. At that\ntime I received a letter from Mr. Kesava Menon and\nBarrister George Joseph.\n\"You must come and give life to the agitation.\nOtherwise we will have no other way except to tender\napology to the Rajah. In that case, we will not lose anything,\nbut, a noble cause would suffer. That is what actually\nworries us. So please come immediately and take up the\nagitation.\" This was what was written in the letter. They\nthemselves chose me and wrote the letter to me because I\nwas very vociferous in attacking the evil practice of\nuntouchability in those days. Moreover, I have established a\ngood name not only as a fierce propagandist but also as a\nsuccessful agitator. When they sent the letter I was on tour.\nThe letter was redirected to me from Erode and it reached\nme at Pannapuram in the Madurai District. On receipt of the\nletter I cancelled my tour and rushed up to Erode to proceed\nto Vaikom. I wrote a letter to Rajagopalachari requesting\nhim to act in my place as the president of Tamilnadu\nCongress Committee. I pointed out the importance of the\nVaikom agitation in my letter. It was a good opportunity for\nme. So, I did not like to miss it. I proceeded to Vaikom with\ntwo others.\nSomehow the news spread that I am coming to Vaikom\nagitation to lead. When I reached Vaikom by boat, the\npolice Commissioner and Tahslidar greeted us.\nWe were informed that the Rajah instructed them to\nreceive us and make all arrangements for our stay, I was\nreally very much surprised. The Rajah was so good to me\nbecause, he used to stay in our bungalow at Erode, while his\nofficials stayed in our choultry on his way to Delhi. The\nRajah and his party were always afforded a cordial\n\n313\n\n\ftreatment at Erode during their stay, before boarding the\ntrain for Delhi. That might be the real cause for the unusual\ntreatment given to me at Vaikom. When the people of\nVaikom came to know of my relations with the Rajah and\nthe officials, they were all very happy. Even though Rajah\ntreated me as a guest, I participated in a number of meetings\nsupporting the Vaikom agitation. I criticized the evil\npractice. I said the god does not deserve to be in the temple\nat Vaikom, if it feels that by the touch of the Untouchables,\nthe deity would get polluted. Such an idol should be\nremoved to be used for washing clothes. By my propaganda\nmore and more people were eager to join the agitation.\nMore and more people came forward from different places.\nIt became a problem for the Rajah. Yet he remained silent\nfor five or six days. Many complained to him, about my\nspeeches. Rajah could not ignore any further. So, after ten\ndays, he permitted the police official to promulgate P.C.26\nwhich is similar to that of Sec. 144 here.\nThere was no other go for me than to defy the ban.\nAccordingly I defied the ban and addressed a meeting and I\nwas arrested. Mr. Ayyamuthu also defied the ban along with\nme. He was also arrested. We were all sentenced to undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for one month. I was put in\nAruvikkutha jail. It was after my imprisonment, my wife\nNagammai and my sister S.R.Kannammal and a few others\ncarried on a statewide propaganda. When I was released, I\nonce again resorted to the agitation.\nWhen I was in prison the agitation gained momentum.\nLot of people volunteered to court imprisonment. Intensive\npropaganda induced the people to encourage the Vaikom\nagitation. The enemies indulged in hooliganism. Rowdy\nelements tried their best to create panic and ended in failure.\nEven those who were in foreign countries came to know of\nthe atrocities perpetrated in the name of caste here. They\nvolunteered to send donations. Daily, money orders poured\nin. A big pandal was raised to house the volunteers. Daily,\nmore than 300 people were provided with food. Many\nplanters sent vegetables and coconuts daily. They were\n\n314\n\n\fpooled together, as small hillocks. It looked like a marriage\nhouse.\nAt that time, Mr. Rajagopalachari wrote a letter to me.\nWhy should you leave our country and create trouble in\nanother country? It is wrong on your part to do so. Please\nleave it and come over here to take up the charge from me.\nThis was what was contained in the letter. Mr. Srinivasa\nIyengar came over from Tamilnad to meet me. He also\ntendered the same advice as Rajagopalachari. By that time\nmore than 1000 people were ready .to participate in the\nVaikom agitation. There were big processions and\n'Bhajans' daily everywhere. The agitation gained\nmomentum.\nThe news reached Punjab. There Sami Sirathananda.\nmade an appeal. He sent about thirty Punjabis to Vaikom.\nThey offered 2000 rupees as donation and consented to\nmeet the catering expenses for the volunteers. Seeing this,\nthe Brahmins here sent communication to Gandhi. They\naccused the Sikhs of provoking a war against Hinduism.\nGandhi expressed his view. He said that Muslims,\nChristians, Sikhs and others who were non-Hindus should\nnot partake in the agitation. In response to his appeal,\nMuslims, Christians and Sikhs withdrew from the agitation.\nRajagopalachari wrote another letter to Joseph George\nstating that it is wrong on his part to interfere with matters\npertaining to Hinduism. But, Joseph George did not pay\nheed to Rajagopalachari's advice. He replied that he was\nprepared to face expulsion from Congress. He strongly\nstated that he would not lose self-respect. Mr. Sen, Dr.\nM.E.Naidu and other leaders stood strongly in support of\nthe agitation. But some people were afraid that Gandhi\nwould write, condemning the agitation and stop the\ndonations. But at that time Swamy Sirathananda came to\nVaikom and assured of financial support.\nThe Vaikom agitation was launched in spite of\nopposition by Gandhi. I was once again arrested and\nsentenced for 6 months imprisonment. Some Namboodri\nBrahmins and orthodox Hindus joined together and planned\nto counter the Vaikom agitation through what was called as\n\n315\n\n\f'Satru Samhara Yagna' (Bonfire prayers for killing the\nenemies). They spent money like water and performed this\npooja. I heard about this in prison. All on a sudden, one\nnight I heard the sound of gunshots. I enquired the warden,\nwhether there was any festival going on near the prison. He\ntold me that the Raja passed away and the gunshots are fired\nto indicate the loss. When I learnt that the Rajah is dead, I\nhad a melancholy feeling. Later I was glad because the\nprayers by the Brahmins and orthodox Hindus to destroy\ntheir enemy had resulted in the death of the Maharaja. Their\nprayers did not harm the Vaikom agitators. The people were\nalso happy. Subsequently we were all released on the\nceremony day of Maharaja. Our enemies also lost their tone\nand tenor.\nLater, the Maharani wanted to settle the problem by\nmutual talks. She wanted to discuss the problem with me.\nBut the Dewan of the State, who was a Brahmin stood in the\nway of our talks and said that the Maharani should not talk\nto me directly. So he wrote a letter to Rajagopalachari.\nRajaji knew that I would carry the laurels and earn the\ncredit. So he cunningly decided to make the Maharani talk\nto Gandhi. It is because of this trick played by Rajaji, that\nGandhi's name was dragged in the history of Vaikom\nagitation. I did not much mind as to who personally gained\nthe name and fame. I was not for any personal glorification.\nI only wanted the problem to be solved successfully.\nGandhi came and had talks with the Maharani.\nMaharani consented to throw open all the roads for the lowcaste Sudras and untouchables. But, she expressed the fear\nthat I would further continue the struggle seeking the right\nfor Untouchables to enter the temple. Gandhi came to the\nTourist Bungalow where I was staying and asked me to\nexpress my opinion. I said, \"It is not a big thing to enable\nthe Untouchables make use of the public roads! Even\nthough temple entry is not at present one of the ideals of\nCongress, so far as I am concerned it is one of my main\nideals. But, you may inform the Maharani, that for the\npresent I have no such idea to launch the campaign for\n\n316\n\n\ftemple entry rights. Let things come to normal before I\ndecide what to do.\"\nGandhi informed the Rani and she proclaimed the right\nfor all to make use of all the roads. This is how the low\ncaste Sudras and Untouchables got the right to use all roads,\nlike the high caste Brahmins and orthodox Hindus.\nI was for some time the Chairman of the Devasthana\ncommittee at Erode. When I was away, comrades Gurusamy\nand Ponnambalam and Eswaran induced two Adi-Dravidar\nworkers in my office, to wear the sacred ashes (Vibooti) on\ntheir heads and took them inside the temple. Seeing them,\nthe Brahmins cried loudly that they have polluted the deity.\nThey were locked up inside and a case was instituted. They\nwere punished In the District court. But on hearing the\nappeal, the High Court released them as not guilty. That was\nin the time of the British rule.\nBut, it was only at Susindram that the first agitation for\ntemple entry right was launched publicly. A Self-Respect\nConference was also conducted under my presidentship. A\nnumber of resolutions were passed urging the abolition of\ncastes and ensuring rights for Untouchables to enter the\ntemples.\nNext, another Conference was held at Ernakulam. In\nthat Conference a resolution was passed condemning castes\nand urging Hindus to become Muslims, as there are no\ncastes in Islam. Some others recommended Christianity\nthrough amendments. At last, the option was given to join\nany one of the religions.\nThe same day about 50 Hindus joined Islam. This trend\nstarted even outside and it terrorised the orthodox Hindus\nand Brahmins.\nOne day, in Allepey one of the converts to Islam (who\nwas a Pulayar by caste) went to purchase an article in a Nair\nshop. He was beaten up and it developed into a serious clash\nbetween Hindus and Muslims. Such clashes between\nHindus and Muslims spread everywhere. The then Dewan, a\nBrahmin Sir C. R. Ramasamy Iyer put down the agitation\nwith an iron hand. But the Rajah was later informed that\n\n317\n\n\fmost of the low caste Untouchables as, 'Ezhavars' and\n'Pulayars' are becoming Muslims. He was also advised that\nthere is no other go than to throw open all the temples for\nall the Untouchables to save Hinduism from the peril. At\nthat time there was 'Yagna' by Brahmins for his long life.\nMoreover it was a custom to say something good to the\npeople on his birthday. It is then that the Rajah chose it the\nright thing to do at the right time. He announced that on his\nbirthday all temples would be thrown open to all, including\nthe low caste Hindus and Untouchables. This is the history\nof the struggle. This is how the Untouchables were given\nthe rights to enter the temples.\nIt is only after all these that Rajagopalachari and Gandhi\ncame forward to speak of temple entry. It is quite absurd to\nsay that these changes took place because of Gandhi. As a\nmatter of fact Gandhi has not done even a molecule of\nservice to the Untouchables. This you will understand well\nby reading 'What Congress and Gandhi have done to\nUntouchables', a book written by Dr. B.R.Ambedkar. When\nI was the Secretary of the Tamilnadu Congress Committee,\nout of party funds a Gurukulam was run at Cheranmadevi.\nAs Secretary I consented to give Rs. 10,000 and paid a part\nsum of Rs.5,000. One Brahmin named V.V.S. Iyer took up\nthe responsibility to run the institution. In that Gurukulam,\nBrahmin boys were given special preferential treatment.\nThey were fed separately. The non-Brahmin boys in the\nGurukulam were fed outside. When 'Uppuma' was given to\nBrahmin boys, only gruel was poured to Non-Brahmin\nboys. The son of Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar told the\nmatters to me in tears. I complained to Rajagopalachari.\nWhen he contacted V.V.S. Iyer, he neither denied the\ncharges nor repented. He stoutly refused to give equal\ntreatment to all. He said that he cannot do anything as it was\nan orthodox area. Then I said that I can give the balance\namount of Rs.5,000 only when the Gurukulam is reformed.\nHe got wild. He curtly asked me 'Are you serving the\nnation?'' I curtly replied, ''Is what you are doing\nnationalism?'' This serious matter provoked me to start a\nparty for the non-Brahmins (Tamils).\n\n318\n\n\fEven now you can find only 'Brahmins' preparing food\nat Congress congregations. Even in those days, we engaged\nthe Virudunagar Nadars to prepare food at the Justice Party\nConferences and the Self-Respect Conferences.\nWhy do I recollect all these past things? You should\nknow that unless we go on agitating like this we cannot\nmake the society progressive. Moreover you should all\nknow that neither Congress nor Gandhi is responsible for\nany of the social reforms, we have been able to witness.\nEven today, we are the only people who boldly ask why\nshould the lazy Brahmins be considered as high caste, while\nthe real tillers and toilers are considered as low caste. Why\nshould we have a god that degrades us as Sudras?\nToday they have created all safeguards to casteism in\nthe Constitution. A Brahmin from somewhere has the\nboldness to come over here, and speak with temerity,\ntendering serious warnings. Why? Power is vested in his\nhands.\nThey tell us to meekly submit as Sudras forever. They\nshow the prison and terrorize us.\nDid any one have the guts to question?\nWe are the only people who are free, frank and fearless.\nIf we are termed as Sudras by Hinduism, what else can\nwe do but, destroy that Hindu religion? Our D.K. is not a\npolitical organization. We do not contest elections. We do\nnot seek votes. We are not for power. Others may hesitate to\ncall a spade a spade. Power seekers may coax the innocent\nvoters. They may hoodwink you for selfish gains. I am not\nfor dragging in Gandhi's name to dupe you all for getting\nany post or power. I am not for that disgraceful life.\nWe have not made public life a profession or business\nto eke out our livelihood. Think over Why? We eat our own\nfood, spend time, and bestow our energies to instill in you\nself-respect?\nBy 1938 you find all over the world wisdom having\nsway. But still here we are like barbarians. Our god, religion\nand Sastras do not elevate us from the plightful rot.\n\n319\n\n\fGovernment is also in the hands of barbarians. No one dares\nto question except ourselves.\nWe are made to be sons of prostitutes by Brahmins.\nWhy should our sons be called sons of prostitutes. No one\nthinks of this disgrace. Those who survive in politics do not\ncare about it. They implicitly obey and submit to what all\nBrahmins say.\nWhen I was leading the Vaikom agitation. Mr.\nSathukkutti the son of Nilamban Zamindar used to meet me\noften and discuss. He used to address me as 'Naicker samy'.\nNot only that. He used to talk high of his birth because he\nwas born to a Namboodri Brahmin. He would often tell me\nthat I should not consider him as one born to a Nayar. Yet\nhe was a graduate B.A. Who is there to condemn this\nmentality in our people?\nConsider for a moment what these 'Azhwars' have\ndone. They attained 'Moksha' by prostituting their wives.\nThis is revealed in the 'Purana' - Baktha Vijayam.\nOne 'Sudra'' an Azhwar, gained a place in heaven by\nallowing his wife to lead the life of a prostitute. The\nNayanmars gave their wives to Brahmins. Even to this day\nthe orthodox people propagate these things without shame\nor self-respect. When I point out these things, I am accused\nof talking damagingly of puranas. Who else talks boldly of\nthese? These puranas ruin our morality. What else can we\nsay?\nAdded to all these the Brahmins have stuck to the seats\nof government. Power has been transferred into the hands of\nBrahmins. I blame Gandhi for that? A big conspiracy was\nhatched to keep us eternally as 'Sudras'. Today everything\nis in their hands. Today the President is a Brahmin. The\nVice President is a Brahmin. Premier is a Brahmin Deputy\nPremier is also a Brahmin. The speaker of the Parliament is\nalso a Brahmin. Added to all these if we plead for the\neradication of castes, they send the accused to be in jail for\na period of three years. Who worries about all these? Most\nof the luminaries in public life want to safeguard the\ngovernment, casteism, Sastras, puranas, religion and god.\nThey think that there is no other go for them to live.\n320\n\n\fNo one who depends on votes and bribe will question\nthe atrocities in the name of caste, god, religion and\ngovernment.\nThe British at least considered us as men with equal\nright. Today the government is in the hands of Brahmins,\nwho call us as sons of prostitutes. That is why they have\neasily found safeguards in the Constitution itself. According\nto law those who demand castes to be abolished have to be\nprepared to undergo imprisonment for three years.\nThis casteism is a chronic disease that has eaten our\nsociety for centuries. What medicine we use for scabies and\nitches cannot cure cancer. We have to operate the body and\nremove the portion affected by cancer. Treatment will be\ndifferent for different diseases. According to Hindu Law we\nare 'Sudras' for more than 3000 years. We are sons of\nprostitutes for over 3000 years. Our constitution gives full\nprotection to this evil.\nWe must root out this evil. We must get rid of this\nridicule. It is indeed the most difficult task. Unless you pour\nboiling water on the roots it will not die. Unless we take\nsevere steps we cannot eradicate castes.\nNot only in Tamil Nadu but even in the whole of India\nthere is no force that can raise a bold voice like us. Those\nwho are after power will never dream of raising any protest.\nIt is only those who are dedicated to serve the people\nsincerely and selflessly, can dare to risk their life even for\neradicating the castes. What have those who entered the\nlegislature done so far? They cannot do anything? We can\nget posts by simply sending a telegram. Yet we are not\nprepared.\nA few days ago Nehru made a sickening note about the\nlegislatures and other elected bodies. He even threatened\nthat he would retire and seek renunciation. What happened?\nHe silently gulped all his remarks and stuck to power. It is\nall mere display of the old Gandhian tactics to gain\npopularity. The D.M.K. people who were with us,\ncondemned the entry in the legislature, so long as they were\nhere. They even wrote attacking the elected representatives\nand the bodies. Nay, even Nehru and Rajendra Prasad spoke\n321\n\n\fagainst the legislature. Because they are now aware of the\nchances, they are quite eager to enter. They forget their past.\nBy hook or crook they want to adorn the legislatures. They\nare prepared to sabotage and expose anybody. Somehow\neveryone wants to come up in life. No one is worried about\nthe age long insults heaped on our nationality.\nThe entire country is in the clutches of three ghosts and\nfive diseases. To believe in one thing that is not really\nexisting is what is defined as Ghost.\nGod - Caste - Democracy are the three Ghosts.\nBrahmins - Newspaper - Political parties - Legislatures\n- and Cinema are the five diseases. These diseases are\npreying on the human body like the diseases Cancer,\nLeprosy, and Malaria. If the society is to progress these\nthings should be fought tooth and nail and destroyed\ncompletely.\n[Viduthalai, 8 and 9-1-1959]\n*This essay's English translation has been taken from the\nbook Collected Works of Periyar E.V.R., published by\nDravidar Kazhagam, Chennai, 2005 (Third edition).\nAgitation against Hinduism\nTo destroy and demolish the Hindu religion, one method is\nthrough law and the other is through agitation. The nine\npoints for agitation are\n\n1. All backward class people and Untouchables should\nnever go to temples.\n2. No one should worship Hindu gods.\n3. One should not celebrate Hindu festivals.\n4. No one should put any mark on the forehead.\n5. No man should have a tuft.\n6. No rituals should be performed after death, after birth,\nbefore birth and so on.\n7. The Brahmin should not be called to perform any ritual.\n8. Photos of Hindu gods should not be hung in ones\nhome.\n322\n\n\f9. No one should go to shops or hotels run by the\nBrahmins.\n[Viduthalai, 16-2-1959]\nDivision of labour\nA labourer's son should not be a labourer. He should be a\nproprietor. Such stigma must vanish. No one can force a\nscavenger to continue his scavenging job. Such caste and\nprofessional atrocities should be banished.\n[Viduthalai, 18-4-1959]\nEvils of society\nToday's Tamil society lives like barbarians. Out of the 280\ncrore people, only the Tamils live like fools in such a\ndegraded status.\nThe 3 devils that have captured us are God-religionSastras, Caste and Democracy. The diseases that damage us\nare\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nBrahmin\nDailies (magazines) / Newspapers\nPolitical parties\nElections and\nCinemas\n\nOur nation will never improve; I have spoken this in several\nof meetings in Kerala, northern states and Karnataka.\nLikewise, the three things that stand as obstructions to\nour development are\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nTo lead our life as said by our ancestors\nLead our life as written by ancestors\nLead our life as great men\n\nThese three stumbling blocks have existed for the past 2500\nyears. Buddha said so. Now the Buddha of the 20th century,\nwho wears black shirts, says so.\n\n323\n\n\fIn a book \"Vazira susy pramanam\" the following is\ndescribed about the birth of saints:\nKalikotu was born in the stomach of a deer,\nJambukar was born from the stomach of a fox,\nGoutama was born of a cow, Valmiki was born to a\nhunter, Agastiyar was born from a pot, Vyasar was\nborn to a fisherwoman, Vasishtar was born to a\nprostitute Voovasi, Koulatya was born to a widow,\nNarada was born to a washerwoman, Mathangar\nwas born to a cobbler, Mandaliar born to a frog,\nChasangyar was born to a untouchable, Kangayer\nwas born to a donkey and Swanakar was born to a\ndog.\nThus our ancestors were born from fox, dog, donkey,\npot, frog, cow etc. How can we take their words as law?\nWill not the foreigners who land on the moon think that we\nare barbarians? Though we talk of such ancestors we have\nnot become scientific to make even a common safety pin.\n[Viduthalai, 22-5-1959]\nBurning the Constitution\nTo annihilate caste they burnt the Constitution. 3000 to\n3500 people went to prison and 15 persons died. It is\nbarbarous to have caste.\n[Viduthalai, 5-3-1960]\nCommunal representation\nTo have a proper and justifiable proportion for all castes,\nthe government should implement communal representation\nin education. The same should be followed in employment,\npostings and in ruling the country. The Brahmins who are\njust 3% of the population are protesting only against this.\n[Viduthalai, 13-12-1960]\nProtectors of casteism\nAll kings protected caste. They demanded Swaraj to protect\nManu dharma. We do not have self-respect or intellect. We\n\n324\n\n\fsell it to satisfy our stomach. Caste will not go as long as\nthe following five exists.\nOur god\nOur religion\nOur government\nOur literature\nOur language\n\n-\n\nProtector of caste\nProtector casteist religion\nProtector of casteist government\nProtector of casteist literature\nProtector of casteist language\n\nWhat has our language done to destroy or demolish caste?\nWhat has our literature done to destroy or demolish caste?\nThey called rationalism as atheism. So, no one had the guts\nto use his intellect.\n[Annihilation of caste, 1961]\nReligion and casteism\nGod is his (the Brahmin's) instrument to protect caste. He\ncreated religion. If we want to do any good act, first we\nshould make a bonfire of religion, god, sastra, purana and\nithihasas (epics). The gods killed those who acted against\nreligion. Vishnu killed everybody who tried to destroy\nreligion. One needs courage to destroy and annihilate\nreligion. A Brahmin writes, \"A Brahmin is equivalent to\ngod and Sudra is equivalent to faeces.\"\n[Annihilation of caste, 1961]\nClass and caste differences\nCan god watch a starving labourer continue in starvation\nand a Brahmin lead a life of luxury? If god exists, will he\nwatch this silently? Our main duty is to educate the present\ngeneration and see that they do not take up the occupation\nof their father. If one asks a Chakkiliyar the cost of a slipper\nand requests him to lessen it, he would plead saying the cost\nof living is high, but on the other hand if we ask a owner or\na capitalist to lessen the cost of goods he will say, \"Buy it if\nyou want, otherwise get away.\"\n[Viduthalai, 9-5-1961]\n\n325\n\n\fHinduism\nOnce the Hindu religion\nprevail, unity would be\ndevelop in science and\neconomically well off. I\nand superstitions.\n[Viduthalai, 23-11-1966]\n\nis abolished, social equality will\nthere among Indians, they will\ntechnology and would also be\nam dead against all blind rituals\n\nRajaji, Brahmins and education\nRajaji, who came to power in 1938, was trying to put\nobstacles even for school education. So he declared the state\na dry area (prohibition). So, there was a raise in the\npercentage of literates from 5% to 7%.\nInfuriated by this rise in the number of literates, Rajaji\nclosed down 2600 schools in Tamil Nadu stating that there\nwere no funds to manage these schools because of the\ndrastic setback due to the absence of revenue from liquor\nsales.\nThis shows the motives of Brahmins who were very\nmuch against our people getting educated even at the\nprimary level. Thus, the only motivation of Brahmins is to\nsee that our people are spoilt and lead a very low life. They\nwould never show us any good path because they are least\nbothered about the country.\n[Viduthalai, 4-3-1967]\nCaste in post-Independence India\nI feel very sad that even after 16 years of independence, our\nnation has Brahmins and Paraiyars.\n[Viduthalai, 11-3-1967]\nCommunal representation\nI am old at the age of 88 years and I cannot hope to live\nlonger. I alone know the state of my health. That is why I\nam keen on getting communal representation.\n[Viduthalai, 18-3-1967]\n\n326\n\n\fDiscrimination in temples\nIt is better if religious leaders keep their mouths shut,\nbecause if they open their mouth, it stinks. Does it imply\nthat a believer in god should not have any sense of shame,\ndignity, honour or intellect? If he visits temples, they say he\nshould not enter the temple. They say you are a Sudra or\nuntouchable, and tell you to stand out. Why do such\nstatements not hurt these devotees? How shameless and\nhard-hearted are these Brahmin people? Even if a devotee\ngoes to temple without any sense does he not have shame?\n[Viduthalai, 27-3-1967]\nCaste and rule\nIn a just, good rule there should not be any difference\nbetween man and man. When man is born, he is not born\nwith caste, riches, poverty or outcasteness. If this is the\ncase, how can low caste, Sudra, upper caste and rich exist\namong human beings? If the rule is for equality, how can\nwe have high and low? If we have to find a rule that has no\ndifference among people, it can be achieved only by killing\nthe kings, gods and the middlemen.\n[Viduthalai, 8-2-1969]\nCommunal representation\nI have been labouring for the Backward Classes and the\nDepressed Classes. I want communal representation to be\ngiven in ministerial berths and so on.\n[Kudiarasu, 5-3-1969]\nAbolition of untouchability\nIt is said that untouchability has been legally abolished in\nthe Constitution. Practicing untouchability is unlawful. But\nit has remained just a conditional implementation because it\nis legally punishable only as long as it does not affect the\nreligious sentiments. That is, with the only exception of\nBrahmins, untouchability has been created among all class\n\n327\n\n\fof people in order to ingrain the concept of lowness. This is\nthe root of the philosophy of untouchability as inculcated by\nthe Varnashrama dharma.\nIf you touch god, it becomes unclean i.e., untouchable\n(pollution). If you come to the sanctum sanctorum it is\nunclean (pollution). This untouchability will not be\nabolished; the disgrace of 97% cannot be abolished unless\ngod is abolished. Can untouchability exist if Muslim rule\ncomes to the nation? To think that this sort of rule is\npermanent is nothing but foolish, devoid of self-respect and\nfull of superstitions. In India, Indians are divided caste-wise\nas Brahmins, Sudras and Panchamas. This division finds its\nplace in law and religions. Ex-Prime Minister Nehru is a\nBrahmin, Gandhi is a Sudra and Dr.Ambedkar is a\nPanchama. Because of this division, majority of the people\nsuffer several discriminations and injustice, which hinders\ntheir development. The terms Sudra and Panchama are there\nnot only in the Vedas and other political Constitutions but\nthese caste divisions are kept intact, they are made to suffer\nseveral unlawful cruelties and injustice is done to them.\nThus, they should look into this structure.\nCan we say with real knowledge and evidence that true\ndemocracy and independence exists in India? In\nindependent India, 90% of the people are slaves. To be\nmore precise, 90% of them are either coolies or salaried\npeople who have to serve obediently to their master.\nThe democracy in India is that 97% of the population is\nlow caste, degraded caste, 4th caste (Sudras), 5th caste\n(Untouchables) and Chandalas both legally and as given by\nthe Sastras. 3% of the people who are Brahmins are upper\ncastes equal to the caste of god. They say it is god's will and\nrule of the Sastras. So democracy also is only a falsehood\nand fraud.\n[Viduthalai, 27-3-1969]\nDestruction of religion\nWe Tamils have no religion. We think that Hinduism is our\nreligion. This is a Himalayan blunder we make out of our\n\n328\n\n\ffoolishness. What is Hindu religion? What is its meaning?\nDoes there exist any evidence for the term Hindu religion as\nin the case of Christianity and Islam? Does there exist any\nevidence for the Hindu Sastra and Veda? They say that\nHindu religion is a Brahminical, Vedic religion! Brahmins\ncall themselves Aryans and they call it the Aryan religion.\nIn English dictionaries we see that Hinduism means it is a\nBrahmin religion, or a religion that is not Islam or\nChristianity.\nAll the foundations of Hinduism make us the 4th and 5th\ncastes! It has disgraced us in all ways. So it is pertinent that\nwe demolish god, religion, Sastras, puranas and ithihasas.\n[Viduthalai, 17-12-1969]\nReligion and caste\nThe gods propagated by these cheats, their houses, their\nfood, their wives, their concubines, their property, their\nmarriage, etc. and the lakhs of rupees spent on them and the\npeople who participate on many days is only to make crores\nof peoples low caste and untouchable.\nFor instance, a man claims himself to be superior to\nother men by birth and so establishes a god or many gods\nfor this act and says that only these gods have made him a\nhigh caste. This means that people who are not high caste\nbecome low caste and for this god is the basis.\nSo such gods should be abolished, destroyed, and those\nwho do not come to this task of destroying and shattering\ngods cannot be human or possess intellect or honour. He\ncannot have the status to call himself a man.\n[God is only imagination, 1971]\nGod as basis for caste\nThe upper castes enjoy life and lead a comfortable life. The\nmen who protect god are of the low caste and undergo all\nproblems in their life for mere sustenance. So is it not just\nand proper to destroy and demolish god?\n\n329\n\n\fOnly because of god, the development of the world,\nsocial sense, morality and above all humanity have been\ngreatly affected. Even if they realize this, no one is willing\nto openly express it. So, I have felt it essential to express\nthis. The sooner man rejects and forgets god it is certain that\nhe would become socially improved.\n[God is only imagination, 1971]\nHinduism and untouchability\nThe minute you shake the concept of untouchability, the\nHindu religion is shaken. That is why Brahmins use false\npropaganda to call us traitors. They say that religion is\ndestroyed by our talk.\n[God is only imagination, 1971]\nPartition of Tamil Nadu\nI say one thing and I say it with firmness. If Tamil Nadu had\nbeen partitioned after the British went, firstly, Tamilian\nsocial disgrace would have been wiped out. Secondly, due\nto his rationalism, the Tamilian would have reached great\nheights compared to the barbaric position, degraded status\nand low caste which he suffers in his own motherland\ntoday. His base attitude, of selling anything for the sake of\nlivelihood, position, and existence, would have disappeared.\nFurther, the practice of low and high in birth,\nqualification and talent, limitless abundant rights for a very\nsmall crowd and the situation of a big or a very big crowd\nexisting by shamelessly doing disgraceful jobs would have\nbeen wiped out. Today, the Indian government's important\npolicy is to save caste, to ensure that upper caste people\nremain in high posts, save the traditions, customs; apart\nfrom that it does not have any particular good.\nWhy should the hereditary kings who ruled this land\nhave to become degraded and live as sons of prostitutes?\nOur people toil as builders of buildings, cultivators of\nlands, beautifiers of the nation; in spite of doing so much\nlabour what is the justice in keeping us (Dravidians) as\ndegraded people and as low castes? Who built all the big,\n\n330\n\n\fbig temples? Has any Brahmin given any land to any\ntemple? For his comfort, temples and agraharams (exclusive\nBrahmin residential colonies) are built-the Sudras are ones\nwho gave you (Brahmin) a comfortable life. Why does no\none question this? A Brahmin has written that if a Brahmin\nploughs it is a sin, so without working in the land he has\ntaken a means of living. Is it virtuous to eat the yield? When\none enjoys the fruits of another's labour they say this is\nwritten by god, it is in the Vedas.\n[Viduthalai, 9-6-1972]\nCommunal representation\nThe government should forever remove the words: talent,\nquality, and qualification from its dictionary. Because\ncommunal representation was against the Brahmins, they\nremoved it in 1950. They have modified it stating that in\neducation, employment and specific professions; the\nbackward classes may be given some concessions. This is\nwritten in the Constitution.\n[Viduthalai, 18-7-1972]\nObjectives\nMy only wish is that all people should be rational; caste\nshould be abolished and the word Brahmin should not exist.\nThis is my only principle. I joined Congress only for this.\n[Viduthalai, 26-8-1972]\nBritain and India\nIn Britain there is no Paraiyar, Sudra or Brahmin. But in\nIndia (the categorizations of) Brahmin, Sudra and Paraiyar\nexist in law, temple, lakes, even in behaviour, in marriage,\nwealth, work, education and god. What is the reason?\n[Viduthalai, 8-10-1972]\nCaste and Class\nWealth in society is trouble, lacks peace, can bring mental\nproblems and it is changeable at any time. But upper caste\n\n331\n\n\fnature in a society is extremely horrible and is a biggest\ncrime that never changes with time. It hinders and stops\ndevelopment, humanity and equality. It is a criminal\noffence. So one can pay any cost to put an end to it.\n[Unmai 14-10-1972]\nDr.Ambedkar\nIn 1925 the Self Respect Movement came into being. It is\nnot easy in this country to fight against religion and\ndifferences. Dr. Ambedkar and I were not only friends for a\nvery long period but on many issues we both had same\nopinion. There is no one in India who is equivalent in status\nwith Dr. Ambedkar.\n[Viduthalai, 16-11-1972]\nRajaji\nRajaji is the one who closed 2200 of the 6000 schools in a\nnation in which only 7% are literates. He was the one who\nsaid that students can read either in the morning or evening\nand do the profession of their father in the daytime or\nevening during off-school hours. Only because of this, I\nsent out Rajaji from politics.\nHe made a pact that he would not receive more than\nRs.500/- per month but he took a salary of Rs.20,000/- p.m\nand he was the owner of several lakhs worth of property.\nHas he led a honest life in politics or in social life? What\nright has he to advice others?\n[Viduthalai, 16-11-1972]\nIndian democracy\nToday's independent India is ruled by 3% Brahmins who\noverpower the 16% Panchamas, 75% backward class people\nand other 7% people.\nNinety-nine percent of the social problems such as\nfeelings of superiority, theft, worry, anger, distortion of\nfacts, loss, cheating, cunning, rape, etc. are at their height.\nInstead of democracy, if there is a socialist rule then all\n\n332\n\n\fthese problems would not prevail to such a great extent.\nSelflessness would grow and selfishness would be reduced.\nThe most fraudulent word in the world is democracy.\n[Viduthalai, 30-4-1973]\nRationalism\nThe greatest act more important than my life is obtaining\nfreedom for Sudras from Baniyas and Brahmins and even\nobtaining a separate state to live in real independence.\nUnlike the whites and blacks, we do not have so much of\ndifferences. And yet they lead a life of equality. On the\nother hand, the Brahmin claims himself to be upper caste\nand we are treated as lower caste. If our nation were under\nthe rule of Muslims or Christians certainly it would have\nbecome free of these discriminations.\nDr. Ambedkar was a stalwart in rationalism. He would\nstate every revolutionary information in a simple way.\nThere is no job that is very low and I am sure that there\nwill soon be machines that will perform all these low jobs.\nTo develop rationality among people, I organized\nseveral feasts in which we served beef (and pork). There is\nno rule or law that says that one should not eat beef or pork.\nIt is unfortunate to state that it has become so inherent\nin the Hindu religion that Hindus do not eat beef and only\nthe Christians, Muslims and the Depressed Classes feed on\nbeef.\nI am an enemy of all religions and they should be\nabolished. If a man seeks respect in his public life then they\ncan be no use or real service. My only mission is to see that\nthe Dravidians lead a life of self-respect and I will serve for\nthis.\nWhether I have the capacity to do this is not the\nquestion. As no one is interested in doing this, I continue to\ndo it. I am fit for that duty because of my nationalism and\nmy temper.\nNot only are we ill-treated as Panchamas and Sudras in\nour country by the outsiders (Brahmins), but the northerners\nare also exploiting us.\n\n333\n\n\fOnly human beings are there in America. Is there a\nBrahmin, a Sudra or an Untouchable?\nAround 200 people came when I beat god with\nchappals.

With independence in 1947 our government system\nassured every citizen the protection and promotion of\nher/his rights. But the right of the safai karmacharis\n(manual scavengers) came to be officially recognized\nonly in 1993 that is 46 years after independence! With\nthe enactment of the employment of the manual\nscavengers Act. But then the act came into force only\nin 1997- after another gap of 4 years even then only the\nunion territories and six states made the central Act\napplicable in their territories even other states have\nadopted the act only in principle for three others the\nadoption is under consideration and the rest have not\ntaken any decision so far.\n2. How to understand this state of affairs? Do not the\nRights of the safai karmacharis merit any serious\nattention from our governance system? Have they also\nbecome untouchable to our democratic polity? Does\nthe ruling class consider them only as dispensable and\ndisposable entities, precisely because they are not\npolitically organized to clamour for their rights?\n\n342\n\n\f3. Why has the civil society not woken up to the denial of\neven the basis rights of the safai karmacharis? Is it\nbecause the safai karmacharis are untouchables dealing\nwith the ''untouchable realities'' of life that their dignity\ndoes not deserve any attention? Is it because they are '\nuseful' to do things which the non-safai karmacharis\nwould not want to do? Is it because they are on the\nlowest rung of the caste ladder- so low that their rights\nare invisible to others, or so low that are an affront to\nnon-dalits' rights? Have even the enlighten sections of\nthe civil society become hapless victims of the caste\nsystem's brutal suppression of rights?\n4. The last link of the colonial chain was snapped in\n1947.But this was colonialism from the outside. Should\nnot true nationalism and genuine patriotism give\npriority attention to the internal colonization of the\nsafai karmacharis, through the more insidious and\npowerful weapon of the caste system and its practice of\nuntouchability? Are the dominant castes willing to\nexhibit this brand of nationalism than any other,\npracticed and propagated hitherto for self-serving\npolitical ends?\n5. When will Dr.Ambedkar's dream of attaining the right\nof social democracy dawn in the lives of the safai\nkarmacharis? More than 50 years have passed since he\nsketched this dream for the dalits and for the nation. It\nstill remains a dream.

Untouchable Status: While in the urban areas, the form\nof the untouchability practice has changed in rural areas\nit continues to be openly practiced. Every Indian village\nhas a segregated and isolated Dalit housing locality\nknown as 'Vas'. A Dalit cannot dream of hiring\nbuilding or purchasing a house amongst the populace of\nnon Dalits. Even a large scale natural disaster like the\nearth quake in Gujarat in 2001 could not ensure that the\nnew upcoming housing colonies built during the\nrehabilitation effort from public funds could be mixed\nDalits and non-Dalit housing colonies. Two other basic\nparameters are used to decide an individual caste status\ninter dining and inter caste marriage. If both these\nbecome a reality between those considered\nuntouchables and those who are not, than the traditional\nmeaning of untouchables caste status does not hold\nground. But in the case of Dalits even when a touchable\ngirl may marry an untouchable boy, she retains her\ntouchable caste status but her children carry the\nuntouchable caste status of their father.\n2. Untouchability: The touch of a Dalits whether by\naccident or on purpose brings impurity for the nonDalit? In some places Non-dalits will immediately rush\nhome and take a bath to purify their body and soul. In\nother places, it is sufficient for them to dip their thump\neven in water, even if it be dirty water, or have their\nwives or relatives sprinkle water on them before they\n\n354\n\n\fenter their house. In July 1998 in the state of Uttar\nPradesh, a Brahmin district judge had his entire court\nchamber washed with the holy water of the Ganges\nRiver because the previous occupant of that position (as\ndistrict judge) happened to be a Dalit. It is common\nknowledge that after the former home minister of India\nMr.Jagjivanram, also a Dalit, visited the famous Hindu\ntemple in bananas; the priest had the entire temple\nwashed upon his departure. It is not unusual to witness a\nnon-Dalit lighting a match and touching the flame to his\nskins an act of purification after having come in contact\nwith a Dalit. The touch of a Dalit, even to food,\ndrinking water, a smoking pipe, mattress, towel,\ncooking pan, water pot, is considered defiling its nonDalit user.\n3. Discrimination: Even today most of the villages have\nrestriction on using neither public roads. Dalits can\nneither take out their marriage procession nor carry\ntheir dead on the main village roads .Any act of a Dalit\nthat can symbolize them as non Dalits is prohibited or\nbecomes the cause of violence on Dalits. This includes\nplaying a music band in the wedding ceremony.\nTucking ones shirt in, wearing sunglasses, riding a\nhorse, riding in the vehicle from the village main\nsquare, even having big moustache like the Kshatriya\n(Feudal).\n4. Forced impure occupations: Disposal of a dead animal\nis thrust upon Dalits. So are all the occupations, which\nare considered to be unclean and filthy like manual\nscavenging. In India, most manual scavengers are\nemployed by the state agencies in spite of a law that\nbans the same. The state under the rules of the village\nlevel social justice committees that is to be chaired by\nperson belonging to a scheduled caste or a scheduled\ntribe has fixed the responsibility of ensuring disposal of\nthe dead animals on the committee. This classification\nof caste-based occupations is rigid. In India all kinds of\nwork which involve some handling of dirt are allotted to\nsome caste or other among Harijan (the word used by\n\n355\n\n\fGandhi for the untouchable, it means children of god),\nExamples (1) Removal of carcasses and skinning them,\n(2) Tanning the hides, (3) Manufacture of leather goods,\n(4) Sweeping the streets and (5) Scavenging. These are\nall occupations, which are quite essential to the well\nbeing of society, but as they involve the physical\nhandling of dirty or quickly putrefying matter, no nonHarijan, as a rule, will do any of the aforesaid jobs as a\nprofession. That would be below his dignity.\nGovernment's Failure to meet CERD Obligations\nPre and post independence, the state promised to remove\nuntouchability and caste- based discrimination. It is true that\nthere are adequate laws and legislations in place to redress\nthe same. The question pertains to implementation -\nmerely filing a complaint does not ensure justice. There is\nno legal system that can keep vigil on the social behaviors\nof the implementing authorities, each of which emerges\nwith his or her social prejudices.\nThe Indian government has passed a special law to\nprevent commit atrocities on Dalits but over the years its\nimplementation has been diluted by controversial\njudgments. The conviction rate in India in criminal cases in\nany case does not exceed four per cent. Dalit activists have\ncome across several cases of atrocities in which the court\nhas acquitted the accused merely on the grounds that the\ninvestigation of the case was carried out by an officer of\nlower rank than the one ought to have investigated!\nThe awareness on the parts of Dalits in fact has caused\nmore problems for them. In a case where there was a social\nboycott of Dalits for nearly three years, the National\nHuman Rights Commission made these observations\n\n\"Due to education and marginal cultural development, when\nsome youths, either assert their right to equal treatment or\nattempt to protect to dignity of their person or of their\nwomen, or resist the perpetration of the practice of\n\n356\n\n\funtouchability or atrocities being committed on Dalits, They\nare often branded as \"Naxalite\" or \"Extremists\", they are\nimplicated in false crimes and killed in false encounters.\nWhen they resist as a group, mass killings, arson of their\nhamlets, mass rape of their women and stripping them\nnaked and parading them in the village are regular features.\"\nThe lack of political-will is more apparent on the part of the\nstate when it comes to the question of implementing\neconomic programs, such as land reforms.\nA Profile of the Dalits of India\n\n1. Poverty: People below the poverty line among SCs\n(49.48% urban areas and 48.11% in rural areas) is much\nhigher than that of the average Indian population\n(37.27% in urban areas and 32.36% in rural areas).\n2. Income: The income levels disaggregated by social\ngroup suggest that both the total household and the percapita income levels are least for the SC followed by\nthe ST (when compared with the national average). SCs\nhave a total household income of Rs. 17,465, a mere\n68% of the national average, and a per capita income of\nRs. 3, 237, 72% of the national average.\n3. Wage Economy: The share of income derived from\nwage labour (both agriculture and non- agriculture) is\nhighest among SCs (at about 33% followed by\napproximately 20% among STs).\n4. Land Ownership: STs reported a higher level land\nownership(69%) with an average holding of 4.3 acres\ncompared with SCs who owned the least land among\nthe groups surveyed(only 47%), reporting an average\nholding of only 2.8 acres. The land ownership pattern\nseems to confirm the historical and domiciliary or\nresidential patterns that affect specific caste groups in\nIndia.\n5. Housing: The village development index is also\nassociated with the percentage of kutcha houses( low\ncost house often made from a mixture of mud and tin)\nover 70% of landless labourers live in kutcha houses, as\n\n357\n\n\f6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n10.\n\ndo a majority of both SCs and STs(74% and 67%\nrespectively).\nAmenities: STs and SCs are considerably more\ndisadvantaged when compared with all other social\ngroups in regards to ownership of and accessibility to\namenities such as an electricity connection, piped water,\nand toilets.\nDependency ratio and poverty: The dependency ratios\nare very low among landless wage earners, STs and\nSCs. The decline in dependency may be attributed to\nthe higher participation of females from these groups in\nemployment and income earning activities. This\napparent paradox supports the hypothesis that many\namong the marginal groups are at the risk of economic\nstress resulting in a higher level participation in the\nworkforce as a coping mechanism. The evidence also\nsuggests that low economic dependency among the low\nincome and vulnerable population groups is the result of\npoverty.\nParticipation in wage earning activities: is higher\namong SCs and STs (58% and 55% respectively). The\nSCs are mainly landless (69.6%) with little control over\nresources such as land, forest and water. There has been\na marked rise in the number of agricultural labourers\n(49.1%), casual labourers (72%), industrial labourers\n(17.3%), plantation labour (6.1%) and fishing labour\n(92.5%).\nChild labour: Child labour exists in 58.75 of the SCs\ncommunities.\nSocial groups and literacy: STs and SCs recorded a\nliteracy level of about 40% in comparison to the\nnational Indian average of 54%. Gender disparity in\nterms of literacy is high among both SCs and STs. The\nschool drop out rates are substantially higher among the\nlower income groups, landless wage earners, females,\nSTs and SCs. STs and SCs have lower levels of literacy,\nespecially at the level of matriculation and above for\nexample only about 5% of girls among these\ncommunities complete matriculation.\n\n358\n\n\f11. Undernourishment and infant mortality: 57.5% SC\nchildren under the age of 4 were undernourished in\n1992 while the infant mortality rate among SCs was 91\nper 1000 live births.\nTo redistribute resources currently under the domain of\nupper castes. Even after 54 years of independence there is\nlittle progress on the question of land reforms. Furthermore,\nthe planning commission of India has stated. The\nProgramme of ceiling set out in the plan had been diluted in\nimplementation. There were deficiencies in the law and\ndelays in its enactment and implementation resulting in\nlarge scale evasions. Several states had made provisions for\ndisregarding transfers made after a certain date, but often\nthese provisions proved to be ineffective and not much\nsurplus land has been available for redistribution. The main\nobject of ceiling which is to redistribute land to the landless\nat a reasonable price on a planned basis has thus been\nlargely defeated. The core questions, in context of\ndiscriminations faced by Dalits on the basis of descent are\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\n5.\n\nWhy are Dalits treated as lesser humans?\nWhy do not Dalits have the same de facto rights as\nother Indian citizens have?\nWhy is strict implementation of the laws viewed as\nonly way to protect Dalits from being discriminated?\nWhy are affirmative action program seen as the only\nway to ensure Dalit representation in higher education\njobs and political offices?\nWhy, in spite of constitutional provisions abolishing\nuntouchability, do government institutions themselves\nfail to abolish discrimination in institutions set up and\nrun out of public funds?\n\nThese questions are central to the more than 250 million\npeople in south Asia whose life, dignity and rights are\naffected by caste based discrimination. In granting them the\nstatus of scheduled castes the Indian constitution has given\nspecial status to them as scheduled castes taking the sole\n\n359\n\n\fcriteria into consideration that they form the disabilities\narising out of the caste system and for having been born into\na particular caste community. The constitution recognized\nthe caste system as an integral part of Hinduism and\ntherefore, the Dalits who converted to another religion were\nnot granted this same special status following their\nconversion. However, as late as 1990 the Indian government\ngranted Dalits who had converted to Buddhism the same\nspecial status as Hindu Dalits, on the grounds that their\nconversion to a non Hindu religion did not change their\nstatus within the caste system and Indian society and the\nresultant discriminatory treatment meted out to them by the\nnon-Dalits.\nConclusion\n\nDalits have been the victims of caste-based discrimination\nbased on descent. The major problem they face is of denial\nand the power to deny rests largely with those who\ndiscriminate. The progress in the country has been lopsided\nand vulnerable sections of Dalits continue to suffer\ninequalities.\nWhat more remains to be proved when the official data\nsuggest that 50 per cent of Dalit children can not complete\nprimary education and in the case of the Dalit girls the drop\nout rate is 64%? What more does one need to prove on\ndescent based discrimination when over one million people\nworking as manual scavengers in the country belong only to\nthe Dalits? The best proof of descent-based discrimination\nis that only Dalits are untouchables.\n\n360\n\n\fChapter Four\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nThis chapter gives observations and conclusions made on\nthe mathematical analysis of the social evil untouchability.\nAlmost all the directed graphs given by the experts had\nmany edges. They were in fact very dense graphs. Further\nmost of the hidden patterns resulted in the ON state of all the\nnodes. Moreover, all the hidden patterns resulted only in\nfixed points. No hidden pattern in all these models was a\nlimit cycle, which shows the permanent impact of the social\nevils rather than the recurrence after a time period.\nIt is very important to note that the attributes related\nwith each and every type of untouchability is so strongly\ninterlinked, it is evident from the fact that in many cases the\nON state of a single node converts to ON state all the other\nnodes. This shows that many of the nodes are highly\npowerful and play a vital role.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that in most of the\ndynamical systems given by the experts (or modeled using\nthe experts' opinions) all the nodes connected with any\nform of untouchability are so potent that the resultant of any\nstate vector makes ON all the nodes of the resultant state\nvector. This factor is very unusual in the study of any\nanother social problem.\nAs we had our own limitations, we did not ask the\nexpert to modify or give lesser number of attributes or links\nor interrelations. In several cases these experts gave over 20\nnodes. On request and after re-discussion we coupled a few\nof the nodes (which had the same shades of meaning). Thus\nat almost every stage the ON state of any node invariably\nmade all the other nodes ON. This mathematically proves\nthat the inter-relation between the set of nodes under\ninvestigation are densely interrelated and intertwined. As\n\n361\n\n\fthe number of nodes is many, the reader is advised to use C\nprogram given in [69. 76] for verification.\nAnother important observation was the experts accepted\nthat certain nodes or relations couldn't be determined.\nThose concepts remained indeterminate, so most of the\nexperts welcomed the idea of using indeterminacy. They\nfelt at home to use this neutrosophic notion i.e., the concept\nof indeterminacy. We found in our analysis that only few of\nthe relations or interrelations remained indeterminate.\nHence we made the Neutrosophic Cognitive Map Model\nthat followed the Fuzzy Cognitive Map Model. Our study\nconfirms the reality of the situation of caste system and\nuntouchability in India: they are extremely central to the\nproblems faced by the people. We could conclude that any\nmanifestation of untouchability was as strong as the practice\nof untouchability.\nThe heinous practice untouchability did not stop from\nthe days of Manu and it is continuing even 57 years after\nIndian independence. In Tamil Nadu, it was Periyar's social\nrevolution that led to a great deal of change. He was highly\nresponsible for the development in the state of Dalits,\nSudras and Women. For more than half a century, he voiced\nagainst the cruelties done in the name of the caste system.\n\nObservations about Periyar and untouchability\npracticed in religion\n\nIt was Periyar who led the first historic and successful\nstruggle at Vaikom for the rights of Backward Classes and\nDalits to enter into temple streets. The success of this\nagitation led to the temples itself being thrown open to\neverybody.\nHe acutely understood that the source of untouchability\nwas religion. That is why he countered a stigmatized caste\nidentity with an identity of Self-Respect.\nThe Manu Smriti is a very inhuman law that\ndifferentiates people on the basis of their birth. This is why\nPeriyar also advocated the concept of Samadharma: equality\n\n362\n\n\ffor one and all. It is clear that the concept of caste is\nactually ingrained in the minds of people because of\nreligious brainwashing for centuries. There was really no\nbasis for the caste system except the various epics, puranas,\nVedas and other Hindu texts brought in by the Aryans.\nTherefore Periyar sought to annihilate the basis of casteism\nby annihilating Hinduism. He did not accept god, because\nall the cruelties against people were done in the name of\ngod. His anti-theistic quote is renowned: \"There is no god/\nThere is no god/ There is no god at all. He who created god\nwas a fool/ He who propagates god is a scoundrel/ He who\nworships god is a barbarian.\"\nSuperstitions were highly dominant among the people\nin Tamil Nadu. Even for small acts like starting a new\nventure, travels, building a new house etc. people would\nseek the astrologers (who are invariably Brahmins) for\nauspicious time and date. By squandering money on rituals,\nrites, superstitions these non-Brahmins lost the little money\nthey earned. Only Periyar's Self-Respect movement\nmanaged to eradicate the baseless superstitions prevailing in\nthe society to a large extent.\nSeveral experts observed the terrible impact of the caste\nsystem and Varnashrama Dharma that has infiltrated into all\nother major religions practiced in India. For instance in\nChristianity, there are Nadar Christians, Dalit Christians,\nSyrian Christians, Vellala Christians, Kallar Christians and\nso on. Untouchability is practiced against the Dalit\nChristians in some rural areas, who are allocated separate\nseating arrangements in churches, separate entry and exit\ndoors and separate burial grounds. Categories like Dalit and\nBackward Class Muslims have also come into existence.\nThis proves that caste system has seeped into every other\nreligious structure in India. Our experts said that Periyar had\nmentioned about the existence of the caste system in\nChristianity in many speeches. It was with this motive that\nPeriyar founded the Self Respect Movement for people to\nrenounce their castes. Also, he advocated religious\nconversions to Islam to the Dalits as a means of liberation\nfrom caste.\n\n363\n\n\fWe have concluded from our study that religious\nuntouchability is the root cause of all other manifestations\nof untouchability. Even today people always fear to\nquestion anything that is done in the name of religion or\ngod. It is because of their blind faith on god and religion is\nso great. Dalits and Sudras who were subjugated because of\nthe caste system failed to question it because it was a matter\nof Hindu religion. This was the reason why Periyar first\ncalled for the annihilation of Hindu religion in order to\nannihilate caste.\nHindu religion attributed the caste system to the karma\n(deeds of the previous birth). The deeds of the previous\nbirth decided the caste status in the next rebirth. Thus\npeople were made to complacently accept the caste system\nbecause each of them were held personally responsible for\nthe 'high' or 'low' status given to them in society. People\ncould not challenge the social setup because it was\nreligiously constructed. Periyar exposed the falsity of the\nnotion of karma. He rationally pointed out that if indeed the\ncycle of birth and rebirth were in practice, it was entirely\nfutile to offer prayers for the dead and perform rituals for\ndead ancestors through the Brahmins.\nThe Vedas, puranas, Sastras, Manu Smriti and epics like\nthe Ramayana were all full of contradictions. Periyar held\nthat they were written for the sole purpose of subjugating\nthe Dravidian people and it made them into untouchables\nand Sudras, that is prostitute sons. He burnt the Manu\nSmriti and the Ramayana; and broke statues of Vinayaka.\nPeriyar understood that it was impossible to improve the\nconditions of the Sudras without first annihilating\nuntouchability. He said, \"If you believe that without the\nlabel of Paraiyan being removed, the Sudra label will go\naway, then you are downright idiots.\"\nPeriyar condemned the use of Sanskrit as a language of\nworship. The Brahmins had claimed that it was a divine\nlanguage, whereas Tamil was a 'low' language. He\ndemanded the use of Tamil as a language of worship,\nbecause he wanted the Sudra and Dalit to understand what\nthe officiating Brahmin priest prays on their behalf.\n\n364\n\n\fHis last statewide agitation was to obtain the rights of\npriesthood for Dalits and Sudras. Periyar viewed it as an\nessential prerequisite to reorganize the social order on the\nbasis of equality. It was more than twenty years after his\ndeath did the Supreme Court of India open priesthood to all\nthe castes. Though the law officially recognizes this right, it\nis yet to be put into practice. Compared to Brahmin priests,\nthe number of non-Brahmins who are priests at Hindu\ntemples in negligible. Even now, the Dravidar Kazhagam\norganized demonstrations to enter the sanctum sanctorum of\ntemples.\nThe neutrosophic model was used in our study and the\nnode Samadharma was included as one of the attributes.\nWhen the only node rule of Manu Dharma was in the ON\nstate, the hidden pattern of the dynamical system was a\nfixed point that showed all other nodes to be in the ON state.\nHowever the node Samadharma remained as an\nindeterminate node. Further when we worked with the ON\nstate of the only node Samadharma we saw the resultant\nwas a fixed point with all nodes in the OFF state and\nSamadharma alone was in the ON state. Thus it clearly\nproves none of these evils will prevail if Samadharma is\npresent, a complete contrast with role or rule of Manu\ndharma.\n\nObservations about Periyar and untouchability\npracticed in education\n\nDalits and Sudras were forbidden to learn anything or recite\nthe sacred texts: this was the rule of the Manu Smriti. If\nthey heard the Vedas being recited, molten lead was poured\ninto their years.\nIf they dared to recite any of the Vedas, their tongue\nwould be cut off. Only the coming of the British to India\nand the advent of missionary run schools provide basic\neducation to people who had been unlettered because of the\nstrictures of the caste system. Even today, denial of\n\n365\n\n\feducation continues to be the most sophisticated\nmanifestation of untouchability.\nWe can conclude from our mathematical study that\nunless policy and decision makers on education are drawn\nfrom the Dalit and Sudra communities, the educational\nstatus of these downtrodden people cannot be improved. It\nmust also be noted that although reservation in education is\nfollowed properly in Tamil Nadu state-run educational\ninstitutions, it is not implemented in the Central\nGovernment educational institutions.\nEven though reservation might be followed, the need of\nthe hour is the presence of Dalit and Backward class\nteachers in these institutions. Only such teachers will\nnurture the students from the downtrodden sections and give\nthem adequate encouragement. A vast majority of students\nfrom the marginalized sections of society complain of the\nharassment that they are made to undergo in the hands of\nthe teachers from the Brahmin community.\nWhen non-Brahmin students at the Cheranamadevi\nGurukulam where discriminated, he fought against it and\nsucceeded in putting an end to it. Periyar vehemently\nopposed the introduction of hereditary education system. He\nrightly felt that it will perpetuate the occupation and birthbased caste system. The campaign he built was so powerful\nthat the then Chief Minister Rajagopalachari was forced to\nresign his post and the scheme was withdrawn immediately.\nHe was also against the imposition of Hindi as a\ncompulsory language of study in schools. He felt that\nlearning Hindi would automatically lead to an imposition of\nAryan values and domination, and would further oppress\nthe Dravidians. Periyar vigorously fought against the\nmonopoly of Brahmins in education, administration and\nemployment, who occupied more than 90% of the coveted\njobs.\nHe seldom spoke without quoting the exact statistics to\nprove his point. As an alternative, he campaigned for\ncommunal representation in employment and education to\nbe put into practice, so that it allowed the Dalits and Sudras\nto achieve equality. In fact, it was his sustained and\n\n366\n\n\fpowerful crusade that brought about the first amendment to\nthe Indian Constitution that allowed the State to make\nprovisions for providing reservation to the Backward\nClasses and Dalits in education.\n\nObservations about Periyar and untouchability\npracticed in society\n\nIndia's development remains stagnated mainly because of\nthe caste system. He said untouchability was crueler than all\nthe cruelties of the world. Periyar, as a social revolutionary,\nperfectly understood the graveness and ugliness of the caste\nsystem. He believed that it was concocted by the Brahmins\nto establish their supremacy. As a rationalist, he fought for\nthe equality of one and all. He felt that the minority\nBrahmins, who were just 3% of the population, was\noppressing the majority of the people who were from the\nBackward and Dalit communities. In the Manu Smriti, it is\ndescribed that the untouchable people had to wear the\nclothes of the dead. They could not own any property and\nthey had to only use broken vessels. That is why, as a part\nof his struggle against Brahmin supremacy, Periyar burnt\nthe Manu Smriti.\nHe led the historical struggle in Vaikom that obtained\nDalits and Backward communities the right of entry into\ntemple streets. He argued that if dogs and pigs could use the\nstreets, why should human beings be denied their rights?\nSimilarly, at the Cheranmadevi school hostel, he\nintervened and condemned in strong words the\ndiscriminatory treatment meted out to non-Brahmins. Both\nthese incidents proved remarkably his commitment to social\njustice. He was always against all kinds of social\ndiscrimination and fought against segregation including\nseparate wells, separate burial grounds, etc. Because interdining and inter-marriage were forbidden between the\ncastes, Periyar promoted common dining and inter-caste\nmarriages.\n\n367\n\n\fHe asked the Self Respecters to drop the caste tags from\ntheir names and to stop wearing religious symbols on their\nforeheads. Likewise, he was responsible for the Self\nRespect marriage that was devoid of any rituals, and didn't\ninvolve any priests or Brahmins and was merely a\ndeclaration between the man and the woman who wanted to\nbe life-partners.\nHe launched agitations against the practice of serving\nBrahmins and 'others' separately in railway station\nrestaurants and succeeded in putting an end to this practice.\nAlso, he demonstrated against the use of the caste-name\n'Brahmin' in the name boards of Brahmin hotels. He and\nhis followers blackened such name boards and the Brahmins\nwere forced to stop using their caste-name on hotel name\nboards.\nCadres of the Dravidar Kazhagam burnt sections of the\nConstitution that protected the caste system. All this proves\nthat Periyar was vehement in eradicating the caste system\nand social inequalities prevalent in the Hindu social set-up.\n\nObservations about Periyar and untouchability\npracticed in politics\n\nThough Periyar entered political life by joining the\nCongress, in later days he condemned Gandhi who\nsupported the Varnashrama Dharma. Periyar viewed the\nstruggle against the caste system to be more important than\nthe struggle against British imperialism. He said that the\nIndians, who practice untouchability don't have any right to\ncondemn the practice of apartheid in South Africa. He\nattacked the Congress party that he felt existed in order to\nuphold Brahmin supremacy.\nSince he felt that the oppression of the Dravidians\n(Sudras and Dalits) was because of Aryan (Brahmin)\ndomination, he demanded the creation of a separate Dravida\nNadu, and he put forth the slogan: \"Tamil Nadu is for\nTamils alone.\" In fact his separatist demand preceded even\n\n368\n\n\fJinnah's demand for the creation of an independent Muslim\nnation, Pakistan.\nPeriyar declared, \"I accept Dr. Ambedkar as my leader\nand all of us accept him as our leader.\" He supported\nDr.Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism. Periyar rued the\nfailure of the Round Table Conference where the Depressed\nClasses demanded separate electorates.\nHe decried the absence of any Sudra member in the\nConstitution Drafting Committee. Three Brahmins, one\nDalit, one Muslim and one Christian were members of the\ncommittee. He said that the Constitution, which was drafted\nwithout taking into consideration the Sudra community,\ncould not be accepted.\nEven now, political untouchability is rampant against\nthe Dalits. Speaking about the state of Dalits in politics,\nPeriyar said: How do we maintain the Untouchables? Even\nafter 200 years of British rule, can an untouchable stand in\nan election against a caste-Hindu and win? Does any Indian\nthink of making the Depressed Classes, who are one-third of\nthe population, stand in an election, support and elect them?\nHave anyone of the leaders shown this way? So, the only\nstate of mind in which everyone lives is, \"I will not give my\nsupport for your equality and if you wish to attain equality,\nwe will destroy it.\" Is this human?\nIn Tamil Nadu alone, ghastly and shocking anti-Dalit\nviolence has taken place. In September 1996, the village of\nMelavalavu in Madurai district was declared a reserved\nconstituency under Article 243D of the Indian Constitution.\nThe Thevars, a higher caste of the area were incited because\nof this and resolved that they wouldn't allow any Dalit to\noccupy the posts in the panchayat and they threatened dire\nconsequences. Murugesan bravely contested the election\nand won. After a few months, on 30 June 1997, the Thevars\nattacked and they beheaded him and six other Dalits. In a\nsociety which celebrated Dalit servitude, self-determination\nwas not acceptable. Eight years after the Melavalavu\nmassacre, in the reserved villages of Keeripatti, Paapapatti,\nNattamangalam, the upper castes see to it that Dalits are not\neven allowed to contest the seats.\n\n369\n\n\fObservations about Periyar and untouchability\npracticed in the form of economic oppression\n\nIt is mentioned in the Manu Smriti that \"No collection of\nwealth must be made by a Sudra, even though he be able (to\ndo it); for a Sudra who has acquired wealth, gives pain to\nBrahmins. (10:129)\" This clearly proves that Sudras and\nDalits were denied even the rights to own land or property.\nThe landlessness of the Dalit communities forced them\nto be economically dependent on the caste-Hindus for their\nsurvival. They continue to be agricultural labourers who are\ndaily wagers who work in the fields of landlords who\ninvariably are caste-Hindus. That is why Periyar had asked\nfor land to be distributed among the Dalits.\nDue to caste atrocities, and the discrimination they\nsuffer in the villages, Dalits migrate to cities and other\ntowns in search of jobs. This makes them more vulnerable\nto caste-Hindus. They inhabit city slums because of their\npoverty.\nPeriyar decried the practice of manual scavenging. He\nsaid that it was very unjust that people were given these\nmenial jobs on account of their birth in a particular caste.\nHe was well aware that economic improvement of the\nDalits and Sudras was integral to their empowerment.\nThe entire project of division of labour among the various\ncaste groups was intrinsic to the protection of caste system.\nThis was only meant to economically oppress them.\nThus we see all these manifestations of untouchability\nmentioned in chapter two of this book are closely interrelated. When we studied the node 'religious\nuntouchability' alone in the ON state and all other nodes\nwere in the OFF state we found that the resulting hidden\npattern was a fixed point. When we get a hidden pattern to\nbe fixed point it implies that there is no periodical\nrecurrence of the situation, and the resultant remains a\nstandardized value.\n\n370\n\n\fFURTHER READING\n1.\n\nAmbedkar B.R., Writings and Speeches, Vols. 1 to 16,\nGovernment of Maharashtra, Mumbai, (1993).\n\n2.\n\nAnaimuthu.
