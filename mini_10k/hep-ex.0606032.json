By using the angle and\nenergy distribution of atmospheric neutrinos, the SuperKamiokande collaboration has measured the parameters\nof oscillation and observed the sinusoidal disappearance\nsignature predicted by oscillations [1, 2]. The K2K collaboration has previously reported evidence of neutrino\noscillations in a man-made neutrino beam which was directed 250 km across Japan [3, 4].\nFor neutrinos of a few GeV, the dominant oscillation is\nbetween \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 flavor states and two-flavor oscillations\nsuffice to describe and analyze the data. In the twoflavor neutrino oscillation framework the probability that\na neutrino of energy E\u03bd with a flavor state \u03bd\u03bc will later\nbe observed in the \u03bd\u03c4 flavor eigenstate after traveling a\ndistance L in vacuum is:\nP (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 ) = sin2 2\u03b8 sin2\n\n\u0010 1.27\u2206m2(eV2 )L(km) \u0011\n, (1)\nE\u03bd (GeV)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the mixing angle between the mass eigenstates\nand the flavor eigenstates and \u2206m2 is the difference of\nthe squares of the masses of the mass eigenstates.\nThe KEK to Kamioka long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment (K2K) [5] uses an accelerator-produced\nbeam of nearly pure \u03bd\u03bc with a neutrino flight distance of\n250 km to probe the same \u2206m2 region as that explored\nwith atmospheric neutrinos. The neutrinos are measured\nfirst by a suite of detectors located approximately 300\nmeters from the proton target and then by the SuperKamiokande (SK) detector 250 km away. The near detector complex consists of a 1 kiloton water Cherenkov\ndetector (1KT) and a fine grained detector system. SK\nis a 50 kiloton water Cherenkov detector, located 1000 m\nunderground [6].\n\nThe K2K experiment is designed to measure neutrino\noscillations using a man-made beam with well controlled\nsystematics, complementing and confirming the measurement made with atmospheric neutrinos. In this paper we\nreport a complete description of the observation of neutrino oscillations in the K2K long-baseline experiment,\nand present a measurement of the \u2206m2 and mixing angle parameters.\nNeutrino oscillation causes both a suppression in the\ntotal number of \u03bd\u03bc events observed at SK and a distortion of the measured energy spectrum compared to\nthat measured at the production point. Therefore, all\nof the beam-induced neutrino events observed within the\nfiducial volume of SK are used to measure the overall\nsuppression of flux. In addition, in order to study the\nspectral distortion, the subset of these events for which\nthe incoming neutrino energy can be reconstructed are\nseparately studied.\nIf the neutrino interaction which takes place at SK is a\ncharged-current (CC) quasi-elastic(QE)(\u03bd\u03bc + n \u2192 \u03bc + p)\nthe incoming neutrino energy can be reconstructed using\ntwo-body kinematics, and the spectral distortion studied. At the energy of the K2K experiment typically only\nthe muon in this reaction is energetic enough to produce\nCherenkov light and be detected at SK but kinematics of\nthe muon alone are enough to reconstruct the energy for\nthese events.\nIn order to select the charged-current (CC) quasielastic (QE) events in the data sample, one-ring events\nidentified as a muon (1R\u03bc) are chosen which have a high\nfraction of CC-QE at the K2K energy. For these events,\nthe energy of the parent neutrino can be calculated by\nusing the observed momentum of the muon, assuming\nQE interactions, and neglecting Fermi momentum:\nE\u03bdrec =\n\nmN E\u03bc \u2212 m2\u03bc /2\n,\nmN \u2212 E\u03bc + P\u03bc cos \u03b8\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\n(TGT)\n\n80m\n\n0000000\n1111111\nC,S1111111111111\n0000000\n0000000000000\n0000000\n1111111\nC,S S\nDecay1111111\n0000000000000\n1111111111111\n0000000\n1111111\nvolume\n0000000000000\n1111111111111\n0000000000000\n1111111111111\nC,S\nS\n200m\nS\nC,S\nS\nS\n000\n111\nC,S 111\n000\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n(V39)\n000\n111\nArc section\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nBeam dump\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\nTarget\n&\nC,S111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n& MUMON\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nHORN\nmagnets\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nC,S111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n\n0000000\n1111111\n1111111\n0000000\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\nNear\ndetectors\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n\nC : CT\nbeam intensity\nS : SPIC\nbeam profile\n\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\nC,S\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000\n111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\nC,S\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\nS\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\nTGT-CT\n000000000000\n111111111111\n00\n11\nC,S\nS\n111111111111\n000000000000\nTGT-SPIC11\n00\n11\n00111111111111\n11\n000000000000\n00\nV39-SPIC\n00\n11\nStraight\nsection\n000000000000\n111111111111\n00\n11\n00000000000000\n11\n111111111111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00111111111111\n11\n000000000000\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\nC,S\n111111111111\n000000000000\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00111111111111\n11\nS\n000000000000\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n000000000000\n111111111111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00111111111111\n11\n000000000000\n00 proton\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n000000000000\n111111111111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00111111111111\n11\n000000000000\n00\n11\nC,S\n00\n11\n2nd-HORN\n00111111111111\n11\nEP1-nu\n000000000000\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n1st-HORN\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00000000000000\n11\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n111111111111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0 0000000\n1\n011\n1\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n111\n000\n0\n1\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0 1111111\n1\n000\n1\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\nS 1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000000000\n0 111111111111\n1\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\npions\n(Target)\n0000000\n1111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\nC,S\nbeam\nline\n000000\n111111\nS\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000\n111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000\n111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000\n111111\nS\nC,S\n000000000000\n111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\nEP1-A\n000000000000\n111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\nS\nC,S\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n\nTarget Station\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nProfile monitor\n\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0000000000\n1111111111\nDecay volume11\n00\n1111111111\n0000000000\n00\n11\n0000000000\n1111111111\n00\n11\n0000000000\n1111111111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n0000000000000000\n1111111111111111\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\nPIMON\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nS\n\nS\nC,S\n\n111111\n000000\n12GeV-PS\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic view of the KEK-PS and neutrino beam\nline and the location of beam line components. The EP1\nneutrino beam line leads protons through a distance of 400 m\nfrom the EP1-A extraction point to the target station via the\nstraight and arc sections. The characters \"C\" and \"S\" in the\nfigure show the locations of the CT and SPIC installations,\nrespectively. The lower-left inset is a magnified view of the\ntarget station. The production target and a set of horn magnets are located in the target station. A pion monitor was\ninstalled on two occasions downstream the horn magnets.\n\nbetween them. As shown in Fig. 1, the beam is extracted\ntoward the north, bent by 90\u25e6 toward the direction of\nSK, and transported to the target station. There is a\nfinal steering magnet just before the target which directs\nthe beam to SK at an angle of about 1\u25e6 downward from\nhorizontal.\nThe beam intensity is monitored by 13 current transformers (CTs) installed along the neutrino beam line as\nshown in Fig. 1. The CTs are used to monitor the beam\ntransportation efficiency. The overall transportation efficiency along the beam line is about 85%. A CT placed\njust in front of the production target is used to estimate\nthe total number of protons delivered to the target. A\ntypical beam intensity just before the target is about\n5 \u00d7 1012 protons in a spill.\nIn order to measure the profile and the position of the\nbeam, 28 segmented plate ionization chambers (SPICs)\nare also installed (Fig. 1). They are used to steer and\nmonitor the beam, while the last two SPICs in front of the\ntarget are used to estimate the beam size and divergence,\nwhich is used as an input to our beam Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulation.\n\n2.\n\nwhere mN , E\u03bc , m\u03bc , P\u03bc and \u03b8\u03bc are the nucleon mass,\nmuon energy, the muon mass, the muon momentum and\nthe scattering angle relative to the neutrino beam direction, respectively.\nIn this paper, all data taken in K2K between June\n1999 and November 2004 are used to measure the suppression of events and energy distortion and to measure\nthe parameters of oscillation.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nNEUTRINO BEAM\n\nK2K neutrino beam and beam monitor\n\nThe accelerator and the neutrino beam line for K2K\nconsist of a 12 GeV proton synchrotron (KEK-PS), a\nprimary proton transportation line, a hadron production\ntarget, a set of focusing horn magnets for secondary particles, a decay volume, and a beam dump. A schematic\nview of the KEK-PS and neutrino beam line is shown\nin Fig. 1. In this section, we describe each beam line\ncomponent in order, from upstream to downstream.\n\n1.\n\nPrimary proton beam\n\nProtons are accelerated by the KEK-PS to a kinetic\nenergy of 12 GeV. After acceleration, all protons are extracted in a single turn to the neutrino beam line. The\nduration of an extraction, or a \"spill\", is 1.1 \u03bcsec, which\ncontains 9 bunches of protons with a 125 ns time interval\n\nHadron production target and horn magnets\n\nA hadron production target and a set of horn magnets\nare placed in the target station. Protons hit the target\nand a number of secondary particles are generated at the\nproduction target. Two toroidal magnetic horns are employed to focus positively charged particles, mainly \u03c0 + 's,\nin the forward direction by the magnetic field. A typical focusing of transverse momentum by the horn magnets is about 100 MeV/c per meter. The momenta of\nfocused pions are around 2\u22123 GeV/c, which corresponds\nto about 1.0\u22121.5 GeV of energy for those neutrinos decaying in the forward direction. According to our Monte\nCarlo simulation, the flux of neutrinos above 0.5 GeV is\n22 times greater with horn magnets with 250 kA current\nthan without the horn current.\nA schematic view of the horn magnets is shown in\nFig. 2. The dimensions of the first horn are 0.70 m in\ndiameter and 2.37 m in length, while those of the second\nhorn are 1.65 m in diameter and 2.76 m in length. Both\nhorns are cylindrically symmetric in shape. The production target, a rod of a length of 66 cm and diameter of\n3 cm, made of aluminum alloy 6061-T, is embedded inside the first horn. The target diameter was 2 cm in June\n1999 and was changed to 3 cm in November 1999 for improved mechanical strength. The target also plays the\nrole of inner conductor of the first horn, making a strong\nmagnetic field inside the horn to achieve high focusing efficiency. The second horn is located 10.5 m downstream\nfrom the first horn, playing the role of a reflector, which\nre-focuses over-bent low energy pions, and in addition\nfurther focuses under-bent high energy pions.\nPulsed current with a duration of 2 msec and an amplitude of 250 kA (200 kA in June 1999) is supplied by four\n\n\f4\n2nd Magnetic Horn\n1st Magnetic Horn\n12 GeV\nProtons\n\n52.5cm\n5cm\n\n\u03c0+\n\n2m\nX-readout\n(36 ch)\n\n52.5cm\n\nB\nI = 250 kA (2 msec)\nProduction Target\n\nB\nI = 250 kA (2 msec)\n0\n\nHV\n\n35cm\n\n10.5 m\n2 (m)\n\nbeam\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic view of the two horn magnets. An electrical current of 250 kA is supplied to both horns, creating\na toroidal magnetic field inside the horns. The production\ntarget, an aluminum rod of 66 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter, is embedded inside the first horn magnet, which also\nplays the role of inner conductor of the horn.

The peaking time of the\ncurrent is adjusted to match the beam timing. The maximum magnetic field in the horn is 33 kG at the surface\nof the target rod with 3 cm diameter target and 250 kA\nhorn current.\nThe values of the current supplied to the horn magnets are read out by CTs put in between current feeders and recorded by a flash analog-to-digital converter\n(FADC) on a spill-by-spill basis. Overall current and\ncurrent balance between feeders are monitored to select\ngood beam spills. The magnetic field inside the prototype of the first horn was measured using pickup coils;\nresults showed that the radial distribution of the field\nwas in agreement with the design distribution and the\nazimuthal symmetry was confirmed to within a measurement error of 15%. Detailed descriptions of the horn\nmagnets are found in [7, 8, 9].\nA pion monitor (PIMON) was installed on two occasions just downstream of the horn magnets, as shown in\nFig. 1, in order to measure the momentum and angular\ndistributions of pions coming through the horn magnets.\nThe PIMON will be described in detail later in Sec. V.\n\n3.\n\nDecay volume, beam dump, and muon monitors\n\nThe positive pions focused by the horn magnets go into\na 200 m long decay volume which starts 19 m downstream\nof the production target, where the \u03c0 + decay: \u03c0 + \u2192\n\u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc . The decay volume is cylindrical in shape and is\nseparated into three sections with different dimensions.\nThe diameters of the pipe are 1.5 m, 2 m, and 3 m in\nthe first 10 m, the following 90 m, and the remaining\n100 m sections, respectively. The decay volume is filled\nwith helium gas of 1 atm (rather than air) to reduce the\nloss of pions by absorption and to avoid uncontrollable\npion production in the gas. The beam dump is located\nat the end of the decay volume to absorb all the particles\nexcept for neutrinos. It consists of 3.5 m thick iron, 2 m\nthick concrete, and a region of soil about 60 m long.\nThere is a pit called the \"muon-pit\" just downstream\nof the iron and concrete shields. Muons with momentum\n\npit floor\n\nFIG. 3: A schematic view inside the muon-pit. An ionization\nchamber (ICH) and an array of silicon pad detectors (SPD)\nare located inside the muon-pit.\n\ngreater than 5.5 GeV/c can reach the muon-pit. The flux\nat the pit is roughly 104 muons/cm2 /spill. The parent\nparticles of both muons and neutrinos are pions, so the\nprofile center of muons corresponds to that of neutrinos.\nA change in the beam direction by 3 mrad corresponds\nto a change in the neutrino flux and spectrum at SK of\nabout 1%, and hence it must be controlled and monitored\nto be within 3 mrad. Fig. 3 shows a schematic view\ninside the pit. Two detectors (MUMONs) are installed\nin it: one is an ionization chamber (ICH) and the other\nis an array of silicon pad detectors (SPD). The purpose\nof these detectors is to measure the profile and intensity\nof muons penetrating the shields on spill-by-spill basis.\nAn ICH is a segmented plate chamber with a size of\n190 cm (horizontal) \u00d7 175 cm (vertical). It consists of six\nmodules of size 60 cm \u00d7 90 cm, 3 modules in the horizontal direction and 2 modules in the vertical direction. The\ngap between modules is 25 cm in horizontal and 15 cm\nin vertical (Fig. 3). The corresponding strip lines of adjoining modules are electrically connected over the gaps\nto make long strip lines of length of \u223c180 cm. There are\n36 horizontal readout channels and 32 vertical channels.\nThe channel-to-channel uniformity is calibrated by moving ICH horizontally and vertically [10] assuming stability of the muon beam. The relative gain of the channels\nhas been stable within an accuracy of several percent.\nTwo types of SPDs are used: one is a small SPD which\nhas a sensitive area of 1 cm \u00d7 2 cm with a depletion layer\nthickness of 300 \u03bcm, and the other is a large SPD which\nhas a sensitive area of 3.4 cm \u00d7 3.05 cm with a depletion layer thickness of 375 \u03bcm. Seventeen small SPDs\nare arranged along the horizontal and the vertical axes\nat 35 cm intervals while nine large SPDs are in diagonal arrays at 74.2 cm intervals. The sensitivity of each\nsmall SPD was measured using an LED light source at\n\n\f5\nx1018\n100\n\nAccumulated POT\n\na test bench and it was found that all the small SPDs\nagree within 6% [10]. The sensitivity difference between\nthe large SPDs was measured using the muon beam at\nthe muon-pit. All the large SPDs were aligned along the\nbeam axis simultaneously and the output charge from\neach SPD was compared to obtain the relative gain factor. The gain factors have an uncertainty of 10% due to\nthe z-dependence of the muon beam intensity [10].\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n12\n\nB.\n\nSummary of beam operation\n\nThe construction of neutrino beam line was completed\nearly in 1999 and beam commissioning started in March\n1999. The beam line and all the components were constructed and aligned within an accuracy of 0.1 mrad with\nrespect to a nominal beam axis which was determined\nbased on the results of a global positioning system (GPS)\nsurvey accurate to 0.01 mrad between KEK and Kamioka\nsites [11]. In June 1999, the neutrino beam and detectors were ready to start data-taking for physics. We took\ndata on and off over the period from June 1999 to November 2004, which is divided into five subperiods according\nto different experimental configurations: June 1999 (Ia),\nNovember 1999 to July 2001 (Ib), December 2002 to June\n2003 (IIa), October 2003 to February 2004 (IIb), and October 2004 to November 2004 (IIc). The horn current was\n200 kA (250 kA) and the diameter of the production target was 2 cm (3 cm) in the Ia (other) period. The SK\nPMTs were full density for Ia and Ib, but were half density for IIa, IIb and IIc. There was a lead-glass calorimeter (LG) installed in between a scintillating-fiber/watertarget tracker (SciFi) and a muon range detector (MRD)\nduring the Ia and Ib periods; it was replaced by a totally active fine-segmented scintillator tracker (SciBar)\nfor IIa, IIb and IIc. Only the first four layers of the\nSciBar detector were installed for IIa while it was in its\nfull configuration for IIb and IIc. Furthermore, the water target in the SciFi was replaced by aluminum rods\nduring IIc. The different experimental configurations for\nthe different periods are briefly summarized in Table I.\nThe number of protons delivered to the target is summarized in Table I, and shown as a function of time\nin Fig. 4. Among the delivered spills, spills which satisfy the following criteria are used for the physics analysis: (1) beam spills with normal machine status. Spills\nduring machine studies, beam tuning, and several beam\nstudies are discarded.

In total, 104.90 \u00d7 1018 protons\nwere delivered during the entire period including beam commissioning and tuning periods.\n\nDuring these periods, the direction of the neutrino\nbeam was monitored by MUMON in the muon-pit. Fig. 5\nshows the stability of the center of the muon profile measured by the ionization chamber (ICH) in MUMON. The\nbeam was pointed to the direction of SK within \u00b11 mrad\nduring the whole run period, so that the neutrino flux\nand spectrum at SK was stable within much better than\n1%.\n\nC.\n\nK2K neutrino beam simulation\n\nWe use a neutrino beam Monte Carlo (beam MC) simulation program to study our neutrino beam properties.\nThe beam line geometry is implemented in GEANT [12]\nand particles are tracked in materials until they decay\ninto neutrinos or are absorbed in the material. The tracks\nof neutrinos are extrapolated along a straight line to the\nnear detector (ND) and Super-Kamiokande (SK) and the\nfluxes and the energy spectrum at these locations are determined.\nIn the simulation program, protons with a kinetic energy of 12 GeV are injected into the aluminum production target. The profile and divergence are assumed to\nbe Gaussian-like and the values measured by two SPICs\nin front of the target are used as inputs. An empirical\nformula for the differential cross-section by J. R. Sanford\nand C. L. Wang [13, 14] is used to simulate the primary\nhadron production in the target.

The neutrino beam is 97.3% (97.9%) pure muon neutrino with contaminations of \u03bde /\u03bd\u03bc \u223c 0.013 (0.009), \u03bd \u03bc /\u03bd\u03bc \u223c\n0.015 (0.012), and \u03bd e /\u03bd\u03bc \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 (2.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) at ND\n(SK).\n\nthrough the two horn magnets and the decay volume until\nthey decay into neutrinos or are absorbed in materials.\nSince GEANT treats different types of neutrinos identically, we use a custom-made simulation program to\ntreat properly the type of neutrinos emitted by particle\ndecays. Charged pions are treated so that they decay into\nmuon and neutrino (\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc , \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd \u03bc , called\n\u00b1\n\u03c0\u03bc2\n) with branching fraction of 100%. The kaon de\u00b1,0\n\u00b1\ncays considered in our simulation are so-called K\u03bc2\n, Ke3\n\u00b1,0\ndecays. Their branching ratios are taken from\nand K\u03bc3\nthe Particle Data Group [21]. Other decays are ignored.\nNeutrinos from KS0 are ignored since the branching ratio\nfor KS0 decaying to neutrinos is quite small. The Dalitz\nplot density of V \u2212A theory [21, 22] is employed properly in Kl3 decays. Muons are considered to decay via\n\u03bc\u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bde (\u03bd e ) \u03bd \u03bc (\u03bd\u03bc ), called \u03bc\u00b1\ne3 , with 100% branching fraction. The energy and angular distributions of the\nmuon antineutrino (neutrino) and the electron neutrino\n(antineutrino) emitted from a positive (negative) muon\nare calculated according to Michel spectra of V \u2212A theory [22], where the polarization of the muon is taken into\naccount.\nThe produced neutrinos are extrapolated to the ND\nand SK according to a straight line and the energy and\nposition of the neutrinos entering the ND and SK are\nrecorded and used in our later simulations for neutrino\ninteraction and detector simulators.\nThe composition of the neutrino beam is dominated\nby muon neutrinos since the horn magnets mainly focus the positive pions. Figure 6 shows the energy spectra of each type of neutrino at ND and SK estimated\nby the beam MC simulation. About 97.3% (97.9%)\nof neutrinos at ND (SK) are muon neutrinos decayed\nfrom positive pions, and the beam is contaminated with\na small fraction of neutrinos other than muon neutrinos; \u03bde /\u03bd\u03bc \u223c 0.013 (0.009), \u03bd \u03bc /\u03bd\u03bc \u223c 0.015 (0.012), and\n\u03bd e /\u03bd\u03bc \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 (2.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) at ND (SK). The validity of our beam MC simulation has been confirmed by\n\nFIG. 7: The schematic view of the near neutrino detectors\nfor K2K-IIb period. In K2K-I, the Lead-Glass calorimeter\nwas located at the position of the SciBar detector.\n\nboth the HARP experiment and PIMON measurements,\nwhich will be described in detail in Sec. V.\n\nIII.\n\nNEUTRINO DETECTORS\n\nA near neutrino detector system (ND) is located 300 m\ndownstream from the proton target. The primary purpose of the ND is to measure the direction, flux, and the\nenergy spectrum of neutrinos at KEK before they oscillate. The schematic view of the ND during the K2KIIb period is shown in Fig. 7. The ND is comprised\nof two detector systems; a one kiloton water Cherenkov\ndetector (1KT) and a fine-grained detector (FGD) system. The FGD consists of a scintillating-fiber/watertarget tracker (SciFi), a Lead-Glass calorimeter (LG)\nin K2K-I period, a totally active fine-segmented scintillator tracker (SciBar) in K2K-IIb and K2K-IIc periods, and a muon range detector (MRD). The far detector is the 50 kiloton water Cherenkov detector, SuperKamiokande (SK), which is located 250 km away from\nKEK and 1000 m (2700 m water equivalent) below the\npeak of Mt. Ikeno-yama in Gifu prefecture.\n\nA.\n\n1 kiloton water Cherenkov detector\n\nA one kiloton water Cherenkov detector (1KT) is located in the experimental hall at KEK as the upstream\ndetector. The 1KT detector is a miniature version of\nSK, and uses the same neutrino interaction target material and instrumentation. The primary role of the 1KT\ndetector is to measure the \u03bd\u03bc interaction rate and the \u03bd\u03bc\nenergy spectrum. The 1KT detector also provides a high\nstatistics measurement of neutrino-water interactions.\nThe cylindrical tank, 10.8 m in diameter and 10.8 m\nin height, holds approximately 1000 tons of pure water.\nThe center of the water tank is 294 m downstream of the\n\n\f8\npion production target. The water tank is optically separated into the inner detector (ID) and the outer detector\n(OD) by opaque black sheets and reflective Tyvek R (a\nmaterial manufactured by DuPont) sheets. The ID of the\n1KT detector is a cylinder of 8.6 m in diameter and 8.6 m\nin height. This volume is viewed by 680 photomultiplier\ntubes (PMTs) of 50 cm diameter facing inward to detect\nCherenkov light from neutrino events. The PMTs and\ntheir arrangement are identical to those of SK; 70 cm\nspacing between PMTs gives a 40% photocathode coverage. The fiducial volume used for selecting neutrino\nevents in the 1KT is defined as a 25 ton cylindrical region with a diameter of 4 m and a length of 2 m oriented\nalong the beam axis. The OD covers the upstream third\nof the barrel wall and the whole of the bottom wall. The\nOD volume is viewed by 68 PMTs of 20 cm diameter,\nfacing outward to veto the incoming particles. The OD\nis also used to trigger through-going/stopping cosmic ray\nmuon events for detector calibrations.\nTo compensate for the geomagnetic field which affects\nthe PMT response, nine horizontal Helmholtz coils and\nseven vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged surrounding\nthe water tank. The water purification system for the\n1KT detector circulates about 20 tons/hour of water.\nThe electrical resistance (\u223c10 M\u03a9/cm) and water temperature (\u223c11 o C) are kept constant by the system.\nThe 1KT detector data acquisition (DAQ) system is\nsimilar to that of SK. The signal from each PMT is processed using custom electronics modules called ATMs,\nwhich were developed for the SK experiment and are\nused to record digitized charge and timing information\nfor each PMT hit over a threshold of about 1/4 photoelectrons. The DAQ trigger threshold is about 40 PMT\nhits within a 200 nsec time window in a 1.2 \u03bcsec beam\nspill gate, where the beam spill gate is issued to all near\ndetectors, synchronized with the beam timing, by the accelerator. The 40 hit threshold is roughly equivalent to\nthe signal of a 6 MeV electron. The pulse shape of the\nanalog sum of all 680 PMTs' signals (PMTSUM) is also\nrecorded for every beam spill by a 500 MHz flash analog\nto digital converter (FADC) which enables us to identify multiple interactions in a spill gate. We determine\nthe number of interactions in each spill by counting the\npeaks in PMTSUM greater than a threshold equivalent\nto a 100 MeV electron signal.\nThe physical parameters of an event in the 1KT detector such as the vertex position, the number of Cherenkov\nrings, particle types and momenta are determined using the same algorithms as in SK [1]. First, the vertex\nposition of an event is determined from the PMT timing information. With knowledge of the vertex position,\nthe number of Cherenkov rings and their directions are\ndetermined by a maximum-likelihood procedure. Each\nring is then classified as e-like, representing a showering\nparticle (e\u00b1 , \u03b3), or \u03bc-like, representing a non-showering\nparticle (\u03bc\u00b1 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ), using its ring pattern and Cherenkov\nopening angle. On the basis of this particle type information, the vertex position of a single-ring event is fur-\n\nther refined. The momentum corresponding to each ring\nis determined from the Cherenkov light intensity. Fully\ncontained (FC) neutrino events, which deposit all of their\nCherenkov light inside the inner detector, are selected by\nrequiring the maximum number of photoelectrons on a\nsingle PMT at the exit direction of the most energetic\nparticle to be less than 200. The events with the maximum number of photoelectrons greater than 200 are identified as a partially contained (PC) event. This criterion\nis used because a muon passing through the wall produces\na lot of light in the nearest PMTs.\nThe reconstruction quality, especially the vertex position and angular resolution, are estimated with a MC\nsimulation. The vertex resolution is estimated to be\n14.7 cm for FC single-ring events and 12.5 cm for PC\nsingle-ring events, while those for multi-ring FC and PC\nevents are 39.2 cm and 34.2 cm, respectively. The angular resolution for single-ring CC-QE events is estimated\nto be 1.05\u25e6 for FC events and 0.84\u25e6 for PC events. As\nfor the capability of the particle identification, 0.3% of\nmuon neutrino CC quasi-elastic events with a single ring\nare misidentified as e-like while 3.3% of electron neutrino\nCC quasi-elastic events with a single ring are misidentified as \u03bc-like. The momentum resolution for muons is\nestimated to be 2.0-2.5% in the whole momentum range\nof the 1KT.\nThe gain and timing of each PMT are calibrated using a Xe lamp and a N2 laser as light sources, respectively. The absorption and scattering coefficients of water\nare measured using laser calibration, and the coefficients\nin the detector simulation are further tuned to reproduce the observed charge patterns of cosmic ray muon\nevents. The energy scale is calibrated and checked by\ncosmic ray muons with their decay electrons and neutral\ncurrent \u03c0 0 s produced by the K2K neutrino beam. The\nabsolute energy scale uncertainty is +3\n\u22124 % while the vertical/horizontal detector asymmetry of the energy scale is\n1.7%. The energy scale is stable within about 1% from\n2000 to 2004.\nThe performance of vertex reconstruction is experimentally studied by special cosmic ray muon data utilizing a PVC pipe with scintillating strips at each end\ninserted vertically into the tank. Cosmic ray muons going through the pipe emulate the neutrino-induced muons\nwhose vertex position is defined at the bottom end of the\npipe. This study demonstrates that the vertex reconstruction works as well as we expected from the Monte\nCarlo simulation. We find a vertex bias difference between data and MC simulation of less than 4 cm for both\nFC and PC events.\n\nB.\n\nScintillating Fiber detector\n\nThe scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector is a 6 ton tracking detector with integral water target layers. Details of\nthe design and performance of the detector are described\nin Refs.[23, 24]. The SciFi detector is used to measure\n\n\f9\nthe neutrino spectrum, and to reconstruct with high resolution the charged particle tracks produced in neutrino\ninteractions. It can estimate the rates for quasi-elastic\nand inelastic interactions and is sensitive to higher energy events, and hence has complementary capabilities\nto the 1KT detector. The SciFi detector has been in\nstable operation since 1999 when the first K2K neutrino\nbeam was delivered.\nThe SciFi detector consists of 20 layers of 2.6 m \u00d7 2.6 m\ntracking modules, placed 9 cm apart. Each layer contains\na double layer of sheets of scintillating fibers arranged,\none each, in the horizontal and vertical directions; each\nsheet is itself two fibers thick. The diameter of each fiber\nis 0.692 mm. In between the fiber modules, there are 19\nlayers of water target contained in extruded aluminum\ntanks. The water level was monitored; it has stayed constant within 1% throughout the experiment, except for a\nfew tanks which drained following an earthquake. This\nmonitoring, as well as measurements when the tanks were\nfilled and later drained, give a fiducial mass of 5590 kg\nwith 1% accuracy. The fiducial mass fractions are 0.700\nH2 0, 0.218 Al, and 0.082 HC (\u00b1 0.004).\nThe fiber sheets are coupled to an image intensifier\ntube (IIT) with a CCD readout system. The relative\nposition between the fibers and the CCD coordinate system is monitored periodically by illuminating every 10th\nor 20th fiber with an electro-luminescent plate placed at\nthe edge of each fiber sheet. In addition, cosmic-rays\nwere used to monitor the gain of the system on a weekly\nbasis.\nHit fibers are extracted using the CCD images. The\nraw data consists of hit CCD pixels and their digitized\nbrightness. Neighboring hit pixels are grouped to make\na pixel cluster. Those clusters are then combined and\nmatched to the location of specific scintillating fibers.\nThe efficiency to identify a fiber through which a charged\nparticle passed is estimated using cosmic ray muons to\nbe about 95%, but closer to 90% at angles within 30\ndegrees of the beam. After hit fibers are reconstructed,\ntracks with three or more hit layers are reconstructed\nusing conventional fitting techniques. The efficiency to\nfind a track is also estimated using cosmic ray muons, and\nis \u223c 70% for tracks with length of three layers, \u223c 87%\nfor four layers, and approaches 100% for longer tracks.\nSurrounding the SciFi are two plastic scintillator hodoscope systems. One is placed downstream of SciFi and\ngives track timing and position information. It also serves\nas a pre-shower detector for the Lead Glass calorimeter.\nThe other is upstream of SciFi and is used to veto muons\nand other particles from the beam, primarily from neutrino interactions in the upstream 1KT detector, but also\nfrom cosmic rays.\nThe downstream system consists of 40 scintillator units\nplaced one upon another having a total height of 4 m.\nEach unit is made of a plastic scintillator 466 cm long,\n10.4 cm high, and 4 cm thick. A PMT is attached to each\nend of the scintillator. The horizontal position of the\ncharged particle can be calculated with 5 cm resolution\n\nfrom the timing information read out by the both end\nPMT's. The upstream veto wall is similar, but pairs of\nscintillators are joined together by optical cement and\nshare a single light guide for each PMT. Thus there are\nfewer readout channels and the vertical resolution is twice\nas coarse, but the hodoscope covers the same total area as\nthe one downstream. The charge and timing information\nfrom each of the 120 total PMT's are recorded. The\nenergy deposit measured in the downstream hodoscope is\nused to select electron neutrino events as described later.\nThe energy resolution of these hodoscopes is estimated\nusing cosmic ray muons to be 7.4% for minimum ionizing\nparticles.\nA more detailed description of the hodoscope system\ncan be found in [25].\n\nC.\n\nScintillating Bar detector\n\nThe SciBar detector [26] was constructed as an upgrade\nof the near detector system. The purposes of the SciBar\ndetector are to measure the neutrino energy spectrum\nand to study the neutrino interaction with high detection efficiency for low momentum particles. The main\npart of the SciBar detector consists of an array of plastic\nscintillator strips. Its totally active and finely segmented\ndesign allows us to detect all the charged particles produced in a neutrino interaction.\nWe use extruded scintillator strips produced by\nFNAL [27]. The dimensions of a strip are 1.3 cm thick,\n2.5 cm wide, and 300 cm long. In total, 14,848 scintillator strips are arranged in 64 layers of alternating vertical\nand horizontal planes. The dimension of the detector is\n3\u00d73\u00d71.7 m3 providing the total weight of about 15 tons.\nThe scintillation light is guided to multi-anode PMTs\nby wavelength shifting fibers inserted into the holes of\nscintillator strips. Sixty-four wavelength shifting fibers\nare bundled together and glued to an attachment to be\nprecisely coupled between fibers and the photo cathode\nof the multi-anode PMT. Both charge and timing of the\nPMT outputs are recorded using custom-made electronics [28]. The noise level and the timing resolution for\nminimum-ionizing particle signal are about 0.3 photoelectrons and 1.3 nsec, respectively.\nThe gain of all multi-anode PMT channels was measured at a test bench prior to the installation. In order to monitor and correct gain drift during operation,\nthe SciBar is equipped with a gain calibration system\nusing LED [29]. The gain stability is monitored with\nprecision better than 1%. Cosmic-ray data are collected\nbetween beam spills to calibrate the multi-anode PMT\ngain and scintillator light yield in-situ. The light yield\nhas been stable within 1 % during operation. The light\nattenuation length of the wavelength shifting fiber is also\nmeasured with cosmic ray muons. It is confirmed to be\nconsistent with the test bench measurement done prior\nto the installation.\nAn electromagnetic calorimeter (EC) is installed down-\n\n\f10\nstream the tracker part of SciBar to study the amount\nof the electron neutrino contamination in the beam and\n\u03c0 0 production in neutrino interactions. The calorimeter\nis made of bars of dimensions 262 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 cm3 . The bars,\na sandwich of lead and scintillating fibers, were originally built for the \"spaghetti\" calorimeter of the CHORUS neutrino experiment at CERN [30]. Each bar is read\nout by two PMTs per side. In the SciBar-EC, 32 bars\nare assembled to form a plane of vertical elements, followed by a plane of 30 horizontal bars. The two planes,\neach 4 cm thick, cover an area of 270 \u00d7 262 cm2 and\n262 \u00d7 250 cm2 , respectively. The EC adds eleven radiation lengths to the tracker part which has about four\nradiation lengths. The response linearity of the EC is understood to p\nbe better than 10%. The energy resolution is\nabout 14%/ E[GeV] as measured with a test beam [30].\nTo reconstruct neutrino events, hit scintillator strips\nin SciBar with more than or equal to two photoelectrons\n(corresponding to about 0.2 MeV) are selected. Charged\nparticles are reconstructed by looking for track projections in each of two dimensional view (x-z and y-z). using\na cellular automaton algorithm [31]. Then, track candidates in two views are combined based on matching of the\ntrack edges in z direction and timing information. Reconstructed tracks are required to have hits in more than or\nequal to three consecutive layers. The minimum length\nof reconstructible track is, therefore, 8 cm, which is corresponding to 450 MeV/c for protons. The reconstruction\nefficiency for an isolated track longer than 10 cm is 99%.\n\nA conventional track finding algorithm is employed to\nreconstruct tracks from hits. The track finding efficiency\nis 66%, 95% and 97.5% for tracks with one, two and\nthree traversed iron plate(s), respectively, and it goes up\nto 99% for longer tracks. The range of track is estimated\nusing the path length of the reconstructed track in iron.\nAccurate knowledge of the iron-plate weight is necessary for the measurements of both neutrino interaction\nrate and track range. Relative thickness of each plate was\nstudied by comparing the event rate using the neutrino\nbeam data. Also, the density was measured directly using a sample of the same iron. Combining these studies,\nwe quote the weight of the iron plates with an accuracy\nof 1%. The relation between the muon energy and the\nmuon range in iron was calculated using a GEANT based\nMonte Carlo code. There is at maximum 1.7% difference\nin the muon range among various calculations. We quote\nthe error on energy scale in the range measurement to be\n2.7% by linearly adding these two errors.\nThe energy acceptance and resolutions of the MRD\nwere studied by a Monte Carlo simulation. The acceptance is ranging from 0.3 GeV to 2.8 GeV while the resolution is 0.12 GeV for forward-going muons. The track\nangular resolution is about 5 degrees and the resolution\nof the vertex point perpendicular to the beam direction\nis about 2 cm.\n\nE.\nD.\n\nLead glass calorimeter\n\nMuon range detector\n\nThe muon range detector (MRD) [32] has two purposes. One is to monitor the stability of the neutrino\nbeam direction, profile and spectrum by measuring the\nenergy, angle and production point of muons produced\nby charged-current neutrino interaction by utilizing its\nhuge mass of the iron as the target. The other is to identify the muons produced in the upstream detectors and\nto measure their energy and angle with combination of\nother fine grain detectors. This enables us to measure\nthe energy of the incident neutrino.\nMRD consists of 12 layers of iron absorber sandwiched\nin between 13 sets of vertical and horizontal drift-tube\nlayers. The size of a layer is approximately 7.6 m\u00d77.6 m.\nIn order to have a good energy resolution for the whole\nenergy region, the upstream four iron plates are 10 cm\nthick while the downstream eight plates are 20 cm thick.\nThe total iron thickness is 2.00 m covering the muon\nenergy up to 2.8 GeV. MRD has 6,632 drift tubes, each\nof which is made of aluminum with a cross section of\n5 cm\u00d77 cm. P10 gas (Ar : CH4 = 90% : 10%) is supplied\nto all the tubes. The maximum drift time in a tube is\nabout 1 \u03bcsec. The drift time is digitized by 20 MHz 6-bit\nTDCs. The total weight of iron is 864 tons and the total\nmass of MRD including the aluminum drift tubes is 915\ntons.\n\nThe Lead Glass (LG) calorimeter was located between\nSciFi and MRD in K2K-I period. The purpose of LG\nis to distinguish electrons from muons by measuring the\nenergy deposit. The LG calorimeter is made up of 600\ncells. A LG cell of approximately 12 cm\u00d712 cm\u00d734 cm is\nviewed by 3 inch-in-diameter PMT(Hamamatsu, R1652)\nthrough a light guide cylinder made also by lead glass.\nThis LG calorimeter was once used in the TOPAZ experiment [33] and reused for the K2K experiment.\nThe LG detector system reads out only the charge information for each cell. The absolute energy scale of 9\nstandard LG cells out of 600 were calibrated prior to\ninstallation by using an electron beam from the electron synchrotron with the energy range from 50 MeV\nto 1.1 GeV. The resolution was estimated by this precalibration to be 10% at 1 GeV. Position dependence for\nthe energy resolution were also measured to be 4%. The\nother LG cells were relatively calibrated to the standard\ncells by cosmic-ray muons.\nResponses for muons were also calibrated by using\ncosmic-ray muons at KEK prior to installation. The relative peak pulse height for PMTs was adjusted to each\nother within 2%. The responses for charged pions were\nchecked at different momenta (0.3\u22122.0 GeV/c) by using\nthe KEK test beam, confirmed to be in good agreement\nwith the expectation by an MC simulation.\n\n\f11\nF.\n\nSuper-Kamiokande\n\nThe far detector of the K2K experiment is SuperKamiokande, which is located in the Kamioka Observatory, operated by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research,\nUniversity of Tokyo. The SK detector is a cylindrically\nshaped water Cherenkov detector which is 41 m in height,\n39 m in diameter and has a total mass of 50 kilotons\nof water. The water tank is optically separated into a\ncylindrically-shaped inner detector (ID) and outer detector (OD) by opaque black sheets and Tyvek R sheets\nattached to a supporting structure. The ID is viewed by\n11,146 20-inch PMTs facing inward covering 40% of the\nID surface from June 1999 to 2001 (called SK-I and K2KI), while it is viewed by 5,182 PMTs enclosed in a fiber\nreinforced plastic and sealed with acrylic covers on their\nfront surface, covering 19% of the ID surface from December 2002 (SK-II and K2K-II). The transparency and\nthe reflection of these covers in water are 97% and 1%, respectively. In the OD region, outward-facing 1,885 8-inch\nPMTs are attached to the outer side of the supporting\nstructure. The performance of OD PMTs is improved\nin SK-II. The fiducial volume is defined to be a cylinder\nwhose surface is 2 m away from the ID wall providing a\nfiducial mass of 22.5 kilotons. Details of the detector performance and systematic uncertainties in SK-I are written in [1, 6]. For SK-II, these quantities are estimated\nusing similar methods as used in SK-I. Momentum resolution for SK-II is slightly worse than SK-I; 2.4% and\n3.6% for 1 GeV/c muons in SK-I and SK-II, respectively.\nThis is because the number of ID PMTs in SK-II is about\na half of SK-I. However, the performance of the vertex\nreconstruction, the ring counting, and the particle identification in SK-II are almost the same as in SK-I. The\npurity of the QE interaction in 1-ring \u03bc-like events is\n58%. The uncertainty in the energy scale is estimated to\nbe 2.0% for SK-I and 2.1% for SK-II.\nIn this long baseline experiment, timing information\nis used to distinguish between beam neutrino events and\ncosmic ray induced background events in the SK detector. The GPS is used to synchronize the timing of the\nbeam spill between KEK and SK. At both sites are a free\nrunning 50 MHz (32-bit) local time counter connected to\na GPS receiver and an event trigger (at Super-K) or the\nbeam spill trigger (at KEK). At first, a quartz oscillator\nwas used with good results, and later oscillator drift was\nimproved further with a rubidium clock. This counter is\nsynchronized using the one pulse-per-second signal from\nthe GPS. In this way, events can be synchronized within\napproximately 50 ns, after compensating for oscillator\ndrift. This is confirmed by comparing a second, independent timing system at each site which gives the same\nresult as the primary system within 35 ns 99% of the\ntime. As described later in this paper, this accuracy is\nsufficient to observe the neutrino beam's bunch structure\nin the SK neutrino data. The system is described more\ncompletely in [34].\n\nIV.\n\nNEUTRINO INTERACTION SIMULATION\n\nThe neutrino interaction simulation plays an important role both in estimating the expected number of neutrino interactions and in deriving the energy spectrum of\nneutrinos from the data. The Monte Carlo program simulates neutrino interactions with protons, oxygen, carbon\nand iron, which are the target materials of the neutrino\ndetectors.\nIn the simulation program, we include the following charged and neutral current neutrino interactions:\nquasi-elastic scattering (\u03bd N \u2192 l N \u2032 ), single meson\nproduction (\u03bd N \u2192 l N \u2032 m), coherent \u03c0 production\n(\u03bd 16 O(12 C,56 Fe) \u2192 l \u03c0 16 O(12 C,56 Fe)), and deep\ninelastic scattering (\u03bdN \u2192 l N \u2032 hadrons). In these\nreactions, N and N \u2032 are the nucleons (proton or neutron), l is the lepton, and m is the meson. For the single\nmeson production processes, the K and \u03b7 are simulated\nas well as the dominant \u03c0 production processes. If the\nneutrino interaction occurs in oxygen or other nuclei, the\nre-interactions of the resulting particles with the remaining nucleons in the nucleus are also simulated.\nA.\n\nQuasi-elastic scattering\n\nThe formalism of quasi-elastic scattering off a free neutron used in the simulation programs is described by\nLlewellyn-Smith [35]. For scattering off nucleons in the\nnucleus, we use the relativistic Fermi gas model of Smith\nand Moniz [36]. The nucleons are treated as quasi-free\nparticles and the Fermi motion of nucleons along with\nthe Pauli exclusion principle is taken into account. The\nmomentum distribution of the target nucleon is assumed\nto be flat up to a fixed Fermi surface momentum of\n225 MeV/c for carbon and oxygen and 250MeV/c for\niron. The same Fermi momentum distribution is also\nused for all of the other nuclear interactions. The nuclear potential is set to 27 MeV for carbon and oxygen\nand 32 MeV for iron.\nB.\n\nSingle meson production\n\nRein and Sehgal's model is used to simulate the resonance production of single \u03c0, K and \u03b7 [37, 38, 39]. This\nmodel divides the interaction into two parts. First there\nis the interaction\n\u03bd + N \u2192 l + N \u2217,\nwhich is then followed by\nN \u2217 \u2192 \u03c0( or K or \u03b7) + N\u2032 ,\nwhere N and N \u2032 are the nucleons, and N \u2217 is the baryon\nresonance like \u2206(1232). The mass of the intermediate\nresonance is restricted to be less than 2 GeV/c2 . To\ndetermine the direction of the pion in the final state,\n\n\f12\n\nBoth the quasi-elastic and single-meson production\nmodels contain a phenomenological parameter (the axial\nvector mass, MA ), that must be determined by experiment. As the value of MA increases, interactions with\nhigher Q2 values (and therefore larger scattering angles)\nare enhanced. The MA parameters in our Monte Carlo\nsimulation program are set to be 1.1 GeV for both the\nquasi-elastic and single-meson production channels based\non the analysis of the near detector data [3].\nCoherent single \u03c0 production, the interaction between\na neutrino and the entire nucleus, is simulated using the\nformalism developed by Rein and Sehgal [38]. Here, only\nthe neutral current interactions are considered because\nthe cross-section of the charged current coherent pion\nproduction was found to be very small at the K2K beam\nenergy [42].\n\nC.\n\nDeep inelastic scattering\n\nIn order to calculate the cross-section for deep inelastic scattering, we use the GRV94 parton distribution\nfunctions[43]. Additionally, we have included the corrections in the small q 2 region developed by Bodek and\nYang [44]. In the calculation, the hadronic invariant\nmass, W , is required to be larger than 1.3 GeV/c2 . Also,\nthe multiplicity of pions is restricted to be larger than or\nequal to two for 1.3 < W < 2.0 GeV/c2 , because single\npion production is already taken into account as previously described. In order to generate events with multihadron final states, two models are used. For W between 1.3 and 2.0 GeV/c2 , a custom-made program [45]\nis employed while PYTHIA/JETSET [46] is used for the\nevents whose W is larger than 2 GeV/c2 .\nThe total charged current cross sections including\nquasi-elastic scattering, single meson production and\ndeep inelastic scattering are shown in Fig. 8 overlaid with\ndata from several experiments.\n\n1.4\nCC single \u03c0\n\nCCQE\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c3/E\u03bd (10-38 cm-2GeV-1)\n\nwe also use Rein and Sehgal's method for the dominant\nresonance P33 (1232). For the other resonances, the directional distribution of the generated pion is set to be\nisotropic in the resonance rest frame. The angular distribution of \u03c0 + has been measured for the \u03bdp \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 p\u03c0 +\nmode [40] and the results agree well with the Monte Carlo\nprediction. The Pauli blocking effect in the decay of the\nbaryon resonance is taken into account by requiring that\nthe momentum of the nucleon should be larger than the\nFermi surface momentum. In addition, the delta may be\nabsorbed by the nucleus. For these events there is no\npion in the final state, and only a lepton and nucleon are\nemitted [41]. We explicitly make this happen for 20%\nof the deltas produced. Single K and \u03b7 productions are\nsimulated using the same framework as for single \u03c0 production processes.\n\n1\n\nANL\nGGM 77\nGGM 79\nSerpukhov\n\nTotal \u03c3\n\nANL 82\nBNL 86\n\nCCFR 90\nCDHSW 87\nIHEP-JINR 96\nIHEP-ITEP 79\nCCFRR 84\nBNL 82\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-1\n10\n\n1\n\nE\u03bd (GeV)\n\n10\n\nFIG. 8: Charged current total cross section divided by E\u03bd\nfor neutrino nucleon charged current interactions. The solid\nline shows the calculated total cross section. The dashed,\ndot and dash-dotted lines show the calculated quasi-elastic,\nsingle-meson and deep-inelastic scatterings, respectively.\nThe data points are taken from the following experiments:\n(\u25b3)ANL[47], ( )GGM77[48], (\u2022)GGM79(a)[49],(b)[50],\n(\u2217)Serpukhov[51],\n(\u2666)ANL82[52],\n(\u22c6)BNL86[40],\n(\u0004)CCFR90[53], (H)CDHSW87[54], (\u00d7)IHEP-JINR96[55],\n(+)IHEP-ITEP79[56], (\u0003)CCFRR84[57], and (N)BNL82[58].\n\nD.\n\nNuclear effects\n\nThe intra-nuclear interactions of the mesons and nucleons produced in neutrino interactions in the carbon,\noxygen or iron nuclei are also important to consider for\nthis analysis. Any absorption or change of kinematics\nof these particles will affect the event type classification.\nTherefore, the interactions of \u03c0, K, \u03b7 and nucleons are\nalso simulated in our program. These interactions are\ntreated using a cascade model, and each of the particles\nis traced until it escapes from the nucleus.\nAmong all the interactions of mesons and nucleons,\nthe interactions of pions are most important, since both\nthe cross sections for pion production for neutrino energies above 1 GeV and also the interaction cross sections of pions in the nucleus are large. In our simulation\nprogram, the following pion interactions in nucleus are\nconsidered: inelastic scattering, charge exchange and absorption. The actual procedure to simulate these interactions is as follows: first the generated position of the pion\nin nucleus is set according to the Woods-Saxon nucleon\ndensity distribution [59]. Then, the interaction mode is\ndetermined by using the calculated mean free path of\neach interaction. To calculate these mean free paths, we\nadopt the model described by Salcedo et al. [60]. The\ncalculated mean free paths depend not only on the momentum of the pion but also on the position of pion in\n\n\f13\nV.\n\nTHE FAR/NEAR FLUX RATIO\n\nA.\n\nDefinition of the far-to-near ratio\n\n8000\n7000\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nmomentum of \u03c00\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n2\nGeV/c\n\nFIG. 9: The \u03c0 0 momentum distributions for neutral current\nsingle \u03c0 production processes off the water target and for\nthe K2K neutrino beam at the near detector. The solid and\ndashed lines show the spectrum without and with the pion\nnuclear effects.\n\nThe effects of neutrino oscillation appear as a reduction in the number of neutrino events and a distortion of\nthe neutrino energy spectrum in SK. The observations for\nthese quantities are compared to their expectations in SK\nto study neutrino oscillation. The ND measures the neutrino flux and spectrum before neutrinos oscillate. Those\nmeasurements are then extrapolated by the expected ratio of muon neutrino fluxes at the far and near detector\nlocations, the far-to-near (F/N ) flux ratio, to predict the\nnumber of neutrino events and energy spectrum in SK.\nThe neutrino flux at any distance from its source can\nbe predicted when the geometry of the decay volume and\nthe momenta and directions of the pion parents of neutrinos are provided. Due to the finite size of the decay volume and the detectors, the neutrino flux does not simply\nobey an L\u22122 rule (where L is distance from the neutrino\nsource); rather the flux ratio between far and near detectors has some dependence on neutrino energy. Therefore,\nwe define the F/N flux ratio, RF/N , as\nRF/N =\n\nthe nucleus.\nIf inelastic scattering or charge exchange occurs, the\ndirection and momentum of pion are determined by using the results of a phase shift analysis obtained from\n\u03c0 \u2212 N scattering experiments [61]. When calculating the\npion scattering amplitude, the Pauli blocking effect is also\ntaken into account by requiring the nucleon momentum\nafter the interaction to be larger than the Fermi surface\nmomentum at the interaction point.\nThis pion interaction simulation is tested by comparison with data using the following three interactions: \u03c0 12 C scattering, \u03c0 16 O scattering and pion photoproduction (\u03b3+12 C \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 + X). The importance of including the proper treatment of nuclear effects is illustrated in Fig. 9 which shows the momentum distribution\nfor neutral current single \u03c0 0 production in the water target both with and without having them applied.\nThe re-interactions of the recoil protons and neutrons\nproduced in the neutrino interactions are also important,\nbecause the proton tracks are used to select quasi-elastic\nlike events. This is done with the SciFi and SciBar\nnear detectors, and allows us to estimate the neutrino\nenergy. Nucleon-nucleon interactions modify the outgoing nucleon's momentum and direction, which also affects whether the nucleon will be above detection threshold [62]. Both elastic scattering and pion production are\nconsidered. In order to simulate these interactions, a cascade model is again used and the generated particles in\nthe nucleus are tracked using the same code as for the\nmesons.\n\n\u03a6SK (E\u03bd )\n,\n\u03a6ND (E\u03bd )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03a6SK(ND) (E\u03bd ) is the neutrino energy spectrum at\nSK (ND).\nThe F/N flux ratio is estimated by our beam MC simulation. In this simulation, while we use the Cho-CERN\ncompilation as a reference model, we employ the HARP\nexperiment [16] result as an input for simulation of pion\nproduction. The pion production measurement done by\nHARP is of direct relevance for K2K, since it uses the\nsame beam proton momentum and the same production\ntarget, and it covers a large fraction of the phase space\ncontributing to the K2K neutrino flux. The details of\nthe HARP measurements are described in Sec. V B. The\npion monitor (PIMON) measurement is performed for\na confirmation of the validity of the beam MC simulation. It gives us in-situ information on the momentum\nand the direction of pions entering the decay volume after\nthey are focused by the horn magnetic fields although the\nPIMON is not sensitive to pions below 2 GeV/c (corresponding to neutrinos below 1 GeV) due to its threshold.\nA description of the PIMON measurement is given in\nSec. V C.\nB.\n\nPrediction of far-to-near ratio from the HARP\nresult\n\nThe dominant uncertainty in neutrino flux predictions\nfor conventional neutrino beams is due to the pion production uncertainty in the hadronic interactions of primary beam protons with the nuclear target material. In\nthis analysis, we use the results provided by the HARP\n\n\f0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\u03a6\n\nND\n\n0.5\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nSK\n\n(arbitrary units)\n\nE\u03bd(GeV)\n0.5\nHARP Measurement\nPion Monitor\n\n0.4\n\nCho-CERN Compilation\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\u03a6\n\nexperiment at CERN as input to the pion production\nsimulation. The HARP experiment precisely measured\nthe positively-charged pion production in the interactions\nof 12.9 GeV/c protons in a thin aluminum target [16].\nThe HARP experiment took data in 2001 and 2002 in\nthe CERN PS T9 beamline, in order to study in a systematic and accurate way hadron production for a variety of produced hadrons (pions and kaons in particular)\nwith large phase space coverage. Data were taken as a\nfunction of incident beam particle type (protons, pions),\nbeam momentum (from 1.5 to 15 GeV/c), nuclear target material (from hydrogen to lead), and nuclear target\nthickness (from 2% to more than 100% hadronic interaction length fraction). Secondary tracks are efficiently\nreconstructed in the HARP forward spectrometer via a\nset of drift chambers located upstream and downstream\nwith respect to a dipole magnet. Particle identification\nfor forward tracks is obtained with a time-of-flight system, a Cherenkov threshold detector, and an electromagnetic calorimeter.\nIn particular, the recent HARP pion production measurement [16] is directly relevant for the K2K F/N flux\nratio because it is obtained for the same proton beam\nmomentum (12.9 GeV/c) and nuclear target material\n(aluminum) as those used to produce the K2K neutrino beam. Moreover, beam MC simulations show that\nthe forward pion production region measured in HARP,\n30 < \u03b8\u03c0 < 210 mrad, 0.75 < p\u03c0 < 6.5 GeV/c, matches\nwell the pion production phase space responsible for the\ndominant fraction of the K2K muon neutrino fluxes at\nboth the near and far detector locations.\nThe result of the pion production measurements described in [16] is incorporated into our beam MC simulation to estimate the neutrino spectra at ND and SK and\nthe energy dependence of the F/N flux ratio in the absence of neutrino oscillations. The relatively-normalized\nfluxes at ND and SK, \u03a6ND and \u03a6SK , respectively, predicted by HARP measurement, are shown in Fig. 10, together with the associated total systematic uncertainties,\nby the empty circles with error bars. Uncertainties in the\nprimary and secondary hadronic interactions, in the pion\nfocusing performance in the horn magnetic fields, and in\nthe primary beam optics, are considered. Here, primary\nhadronic interactions are defined as hadronic interactions\nof protons with more than 10 GeV total energy in aluminum, while secondary hadronic interactions are defined\nto be hadronic interactions that are not primary ones. In\nthe following, the assumptions on systematic uncertainties affecting neutrino flux predictions are summarized.\nThe uncertainty in the multiplicity and kinematics of\n\u03c0 + production in primary hadronic interactions is estimated based on the accurate HARP results. In this case,\nthe HARP \u03c0 + Sanford-Wang parameters' uncertainties\nand correlations given in [16] are propagated into flux\nuncertainties using standard error matrix propagation\nmethods: the flux variation in each energy bin is estimated by varying a given Sanford-Wang parameter by a\nunit standard deviation in the beam MC simulation.

The PIMON predictions are normalized such that\nthe integrated fluxes above 1 GeV neutrino energy match the\nHARP ones, at both the near and far detectors.\n\nuncertainty of about 30% is assumed for the uncertainty\nin the proton-aluminum hadronic interaction length. The\nuncertainty in the overall charged and neutral kaon production normalization is assumed to be 50%.\nThe systematic uncertainty due to our imperfect\nknowledge of secondary hadronic interactions, such as\n\u03c0 + absorption in the target and horns, is also considered. We take the relatively large differences between the\nGCALOR/GFLUKA [18, 19, 20] and GHEISHA [63] descriptions of secondary interactions, also in comparison\nto available experimental data, to estimate this uncertainty.\n\n\f2.5\nHARP Measurement\nPion Monitor\n\n2\n\nCho-CERN Compilation\n\nSK\n\n\u03a6 /\u03a6\n\nND\n\n-6\n\n(10 )\n\n15\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nE\u03bd(GeV)\nFIG. 11: Prediction for the K2K muon neutrino F/N flux\nratio in absence of oscillations.

We assume a\n10% uncertainty in the absolute field strength, which is\nwithin the experimental uncertainty on the magnetic field\nstrength and the horn current measured using inductive\ncoils during horn testing phase [9]. Furthermore, a periodic perturbation in azimuth of up to \u00b115% amplitude\nwith respect to the nominal field strength is assumed as\nthe uncertainty in the field homogeneity, which is also\nbased on the experimental accuracy achieved in the measurement of the magnetic field mapping in azimuth during horn testing [10].\nFinally, beam optics uncertainties are estimated based\non measurements taken with two segmented plate ionization chambers (SPICs) located upstream of the target. An uncertainty of 1.2 mm and 2.0 mrad in the mean\ntransverse impact point on target and in the mean injection angle, respectively, are assumed based on long-term\nbeam stability studies [64]. The uncertainty on the beam\nprofile width at the target and angular divergence is also\nestimated, based on the \u223c20% accuracy with which the\nbeam profile widths are measured at the SPIC detector\nlocations [64].\nThe F/N flux ratio, \u03a6SK /\u03a6ND, predicted by the\nHARP \u03c0 + production measurement for primary hadronic\n\ninteractions with the systematic error evaluation discussed above, in the absence of neutrino oscillations, is\nshown in Fig. 11 as a function of neutrino energy. We\nestimate that the flux ratio uncertainty as a function of\nthe neutrino energy binning used in this analysis is at\nthe 2-3% level below 1 GeV neutrino energy, while it\nis of the order of 4-9% above 1 GeV. We find that the\ndominant contribution to the uncertainty in F/N comes\nfrom the HARP \u03c0 + measurement itself. In particular,\nthe uncertainty in the flux ratio prediction integrated\nover all neutrino energies is 2.0%, where the contribution of the HARP \u03c0 + production uncertainty is 1.4%.\nTable III shows the contributions of all systematic uncertainty sources discussed above on the far-to-near flux\nratio prediction for each neutrino energy bin.\nThe dotted histograms in Figures 10 and 11 show the\ncentral value predicted by using the \"Cho-CERN\" compilation for primary hadronic interactions, which was used\nin K2K prior to the availability of HARP data. In this\ncase, the same Sanford-Wang functional form of \u03c0 + production is employed to describe a CERN compilation of\n\u03c0 + production measurements in proton-beryllium interactions, which is mostly based on Cho et al. data [15]. A\nnuclear correction to account for the different pion production kinematics in different nuclear target materials is\napplied. The details of the Cho-CERN compilation are\ndescribed in Sec. II C. We find that the predictions of\nF/N flux ratio by HARP and Cho-CERN are consistent\nwith each other for all neutrino energies. Note that the\ndifference between Cho-CERN and HARP central values\nrepresents a difference in hadron production treatment\nonly.\n\nC.\n\nConfirmation of far-to-near ratio by pion\nmonitor measurement\n\nA confirmation for the validity of the F/N ratio has\nbeen performed by in-situ pion monitor (PIMON) measurements. The PIMON was installed on two occasions\njust downstream the horn magnets to measure the momentum (p\u03c0 ) versus angle (\u03b8\u03c0 ) 2-dimensional distribution of pions entering the decay volume. The PIMON\nmeasurements were done twice: once measurement was\ndone in June 1999 for the configuration of Ia period\n(200 kA horn current with 2 cm target diameter) and\nthe other was done in November 1999 for the configuration of the other periods (250 kA horn current with 3 cm\ntarget diameter).\nA schematic view of PIMON is shown in Fig. 12. PIMON is a gas Cherenkov imaging detector which consists of a gas vessel, a spherical mirror, and an array of\n20 photomultiplier tubes. The Cherenkov photons emitted by pions passing through the gas vessel are reflected\ntoward and focused onto the PMT array by the spherical mirror. Then, the PMT array on the focal plane\ndetects the Cherenkov image.

The gas vessel is filled with\nfreon gas R-318 (C4 F8 ). A wedge-shaped spherical mirror is\nset inside the gas vessel and Cherenkov light produced by the\npions in the beam, represented by the concentric circles in the\nfigure, is reflected by the mirror and directed to the array of\nphoto-multiplier tubes which is set in the focal plane.\n\ndirection are focused to the same position on the focal\nplane, giving us information on the direction of the pions. The pion momentum is also obtained from the size\nof the Cherenkov ring. Furthermore, a momentum scan\ncan be done by varying the refractive index of the inner\ngas. Therefore, the momentum and direction of pions\ncan be measured separately by looking at the Cherenkov\nlight distribution on the focal plane.\nAs shown in Fig. 12, a wedge-shaped mirror is used as\nthe spherical mirror to measure only 1/30 of the beam\nassuming azimuthal symmetry of the distribution. Its\ntop is aligned to be on the beam center. The reflection\n\nangle with respect to beam direction is 30\u25e6 .\nAn array of 20 PMTs (modified R5600-01Q made by\nHamamatsu Corporation) is set 3 m away from the beam\ncenter to avoid excess exposure to radiation. The size of\nthe PMT outer socket is 15.5 mm in diameter and the\nsensitive area of the photocathode is 8 mm in diameter. They are arranged vertically at 35 mm intervals.\nThe array can be moved by a half pitch of the interval along the array, and hence 40 data points (one point\nfor every 1.75 cm) are taken for a Cherenkov light distribution. The relative gain among 20 PMTs was calibrated using Xe lamp before the measurements. The\ngain ratio between neighboring PMTs was also checked\nusing Cherenkov photons during the run. The error on\nthe relative gain calibration is estimated to be 10% for\nthe June 1999 run and 5% for the November 1999 run.\nSaturation of the PMTs was observed in the June 1999\nrun, which was corrected by a second order polynomial\nfunction. The uncertainty due to this correction was estimated to be 4% [10].\nThe gas vessel is filled with freon gas R-318 (C4 F8 ).\nIts refractive index n is varied by changing the gas\npressure using the external gas system. The data are\ntaken at several refractive indices ranging between n =\n1.00024\u22121.00242 to make PIMON sensitive to different\npion momenta. The refractive index was not adjusted\nbeyond n = 1.00242 since the primary protons also emit\nCherenkov photons when n exceeds this value, and become a severe background to the pion measurement. This\ncorresponds to setting a momentum threshold of 2 GeV/c\nfor pions, which corresponds to an energy threshold of\n1 GeV for neutrinos. The absolute refractive index is\ncalibrated by the Cherenkov photon distribution from\n12 GeV primary protons with the refractive index set at\nn = 1.00294.\nThe Cherenkov light distribution for each refractive index is taken by the PMT array. For the background subtraction, a measurement with the mirror directed away\nfrom the direction of PMT array was performed.

The light distribution for this background\nis estimated using a MC simulation. The normalization\nin the subtraction is done by using the distribution measured at the lowest refractive index, where the contribution from the electromagnetic components is dominant.\nAfter all backgrounds are subtracted, the distribution of\nthe Cherenkov light emitted from pions is obtained as\nshown in Fig. 13. The prediction of the MC simulation\nis superimposed as well.\nA \u03c72 -fitting is employed to extract the (p\u03c0 , \u03b8\u03c0 ) 2dimensional distribution from the Cherenkov light distributions with various refractive indices. The (p\u03c0 , \u03b8\u03c0 )plane is binned into 5 \u00d7 10 bins; 5 bins in p\u03c0 above\n2 GeV/c with 1 GeV/c slice (the last bin is integrated\nover p\u03c0 > 6 GeV/c) and 10 bins in \u03b8\u03c0 from \u221250 mrad to\n50 mrad with 10 mrad slices. Templates of the Cherenkov\nlight distributions emitted by pions in these bins are produced for each refractive index using a MC simulation.\nThen, the weight of the contribution from each (p\u03c0 , \u03b8\u03c0 )\nbin being the fitting parameter, the MC templates are\nfit to observed Cherenkov light distributions. The fitting is done for the data in June 1999 and in November\n1999, separately. The resulting values of fitting parameters and errors on them in November 1999 run are shown\nin Fig. 14.\nThe neutrino energy spectra at ND and SK are derived by using the weighting factors obtained above and\na MC simulation. The neutrino energy is binned into 6\nbins: 0.5 GeV bins up to 2.5 GeV, and integrated above\n2.5 GeV. The contribution of pions in each (p\u03c0 , \u03b8\u03c0 ) bin\n\nto neutrino energy bins is estimated by a MC simulation,\nwhere to a good approximation it depends only on the\npion kinematics and the geometry of the decay volume.\nThen, the neutrino spectrum is obtained by summing up\nthese contributions weighted by fitted factors. Finally,\nthe ratio of the neutrino spectra at SK to that at ND\nyields the F/N ratio.\nThe extracted neutrino spectra and the F/N ratio from\nthe PIMON data taken in November 1999 are shown\nin Fig. 10 and 11 with empty squares and shaded error boxes. All the systematic uncertainties in deriving\nthem from the PIMON measurement are included in the\nerrors, where the most dominant contributions to the error on the F/N flux ratio come from the fitting error, the\nuncertainty in the analysis methodology, and the uncertainty in the azimuthal symmetry of the horn magnetic\nfield. Further details on the systematic uncertainties in\nthe PIMON measurement are described in [10].\n\nD.\n\nThe far-to-near ratio in K2K\n\nThe F/N flux ratio used to extrapolate the measurements in ND to the expectation in SK is obtained in\nthree independent ways: using the HARP measurement,\nthe Cho-CERN model, and the PIMON measurement, as\ndescribed in the previous sections. We find that all three\npredictions of the F/N ratio are consistent with each\nother within their measurement uncertainties. Among\nthese measurements, we use the one predicted by the\nHARP measurement in our neutrino oscillation analysis\ndescribed in this paper, since the HARP pion production\nmeasurement was done for the same conditions as K2K\nexperiment: the proton beam momentum and the relevant phase space of pions responsible for the neutrinos\nin K2K are the same. In particular, the measured momentum region by the HARP experiment reaches below\n2 GeV/c down to 0.75 GeV/c where the PIMON is insensitive. The HARP measurement also gives us the most\n\n\f18\nTABLE IV: Predictions for the F/N muon neutrino flux ratio\nas a function of neutrino energy, for the HARP model for \u03c0 +\nproduction in primary hadronic interactions.

IV, where the index\ni denotes an energy bin number. The total systematic\nuncertainties on the F/N flux ratio as a function of neutrino energy are given in Tab. V, together with the uncertainty correlations among different energy bins, expressed\nin terms of the fractional error matrix h\u03b4Ri \u03b4Rj i/(Ri Rj ),\nwhere i, j label neutrino energy bins. The F/N central\nvalues and its error matrix are used in the analysis for\nneutrino oscillation described later.\nWhile the neutrino flux predictions given in this section are appropriate for most of the protons on target\nused in this analysis, a small fraction of the data was\ntaken with a different beam configuration. The K2K-Ia\nperiod differed from the later configuration, as described\nin Sec. II B. As a result, the far/near flux ratio for June\n1999 is separately estimated, in the same manner as described above for later run periods. We find that the flux\nratio predictions for the two beam configurations, integrated over all neutrino energies, differ by about 0.4%.\nThe flux ratio prediction for the June 1999 beam configuration and the ND spectrum shape uncertainties are\nused to estimate the expected number of neutrino events\nin SK and its error for the June 1999 period.\n\nNeutrino event rate\n\nAs described in Section III.A, the 1KT water cherenkov\ndetector serves to measure the absolute number of neutrino interactions in the near site and to predict the number of neutrino interactions in the far site. Since the\n1KT uses a water target and almost the same hardware\nand software as SK, the systematic error in the predicted\nnumber of interactions at the far site can be reduced. The\nintensity of the neutrino beam is high enough that multiple neutrino interactions per spill may occur in the 1KT.\nWhen this happens it is difficult to reconstruct events.\nWe employ Flash Analog-To-Digital Converters (FADCs)\nto record the PMTSUM signal (see Section III.A) and\nwe can get the number of neutrino interactions by counting the number of peaks above a threshold. We set this\nthreshold at 1000 photoelectrons (p.e.), approximately\nequivalent to a 100 MeV electron signal, to reject low\nenergy background such as decay electrons from stopped\nmuons. In Fig. 15, the upper and lower figures show the\nnumber of peaks in a spill and the timing information\nof the peaks, respectively. We can clearly see the 9 micro bunch structure of the beam in the lower figure. The\nfraction of multi-peak interactions in a spill is about 10%\nof single-peak spills.\nSometimes the FADCs cannot identify multiple interactions if these events happen in the same bunch and\nthe time gap between the interactions is too small. To\ncorrect for this possibility, we employ a MC simulation\nwith multiple interactions to estimate the misidentification probability. The PMTSUM signals recorded by the\nFADC are simulated, so the same method can be used for\nthe MC simulation and data. We found that the number\nof interactions in the fiducial volume is underestimated\nby 2.3% for multiple interactions. The multiple interactions contribute 34% of the total number of interactions, and we have to correct the number of events by this\nmulti-interaction misidentification probability, according\nto Cmulti = 1 + 0.023 \u00d7 0.34 = 1.008.\nThe fiducial volume in the 1KT is defined as a horizontal cylinder with axis along the beam direction (zaxis).

The lower figure shows the time distribution\nof peaks of PMTSUM signal which are recorded by FADC.\nThe beam's 9 micro bunch structure can be seen clearly.\n\nmass is 25 tons. The fiducial volume cut results in an\nalmost pure neutrino sample, rejecting cosmic rays or\nmuons generated by the beam in the materials surrounding the 1KT (beam-induced muons). Figure 16 shows\nthe vertex distributions of data and the MC simulation.\nBecause we simulate only neutrino interactions without\nbeam-induced muons and without the cosmic-ray muons,\nwe can see excess events upstream of the z-distribution\nand the top part of the detector (y > 400 cm) in data.\nThe data and the MC simulation are in good agreement\nin the fiducial volume.\nTwo major background sources are considered. Cosmic ray events usually have a vertex near the upper wall\nof the inner tank, but some events contaminate the fiducial volume due to failure of the vertex reconstruction.\nTo estimate the background rate, we run the detector\nwithout the beam, replacing the spill trigger by a periodical clock signal. The beam-off data are analyzed in\nthe same way as the neutrino data; it is found that cosmic rays in the fiducial volume are 1.0% of the neutrino\ndata. The other important background source is beaminduced muons which can be tagged by PMTs located in\nthe outer detector. After the vertex cut, the remaining\nevents are scanned with a visual event display and the\nfraction of beam induced muons found is 0.5%. In addition, we had fake events which were produced by signal\nreflection due to an impedance mismatch of the cables\nin the 1999 runs only. The total background fraction is\nestimated to be 1.5% for runs starting in 2000, and 3.1%\nbefore 2000.\nThe neutrino event selection efficiency is calculated\n\n200\n\n4000\n\n40000\n\n0\n\n0\nZ (cm)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 16: The upper figure shows the vertex distribution in z\nwith an Rxy < 200 cm cut.

The overall efficiency including all energies and all interaction types is 75% for the configuration\nwith a 250kA horn current, and 71% for the 200kA configuration. We had a problem with the FADC in November\n1999 which corresponds to 3% of all data, and the efficiency in this period was 5% lower than the other 250kA\nconfiguration periods. The dominant inefficiency comes\nfrom the single peak selection with a 1000 p.e. threshold\nby FADC. Figure 18 shows the peak-finding efficiency of\nthe FADC as a function of total charge. The 2000-2004\ndata plotted in the figure shows that the efficiency curves\nare stable. The MC event selection efficiency is obtained\nby smearing the threshold assuming a gaussian distribution, in which the mean and width are obtained by fitting\nthe data.\nWhile the FADC can count the event multiplicity, they\ndo not record information about each PMT channel. The\nATM gives the timing and charge information of each individual PMT channel which allows event reconstruction\nif the spill has a single interaction.

The dominant error is the uncertainty of the fiducial volume. From\nthe comparison of neutrino interactions in data and the\nMC simulation, we quantitatively estimate the fiducial\nvolume systematics. Varying the definition of the fiducial volume by about five times the vertex resolution,\nwe observe a difference in the calculated event rate of\n1.8%. Most of the difference is due to the z-dependence\nof partially contained events. To estimate this systematic\neffect, we used deposited energy from neutrino interactions themselves for partially-contained events since the\ndeposited energy is roughly linear in the distance from\nthe vertex to the downstream wall of the ID. We use\nthe \"cosmic-ray pipe\" muons, described in Section III A,\nto define the energy scale for partially-contained events\nwithin 2.3%. We do not see evidence for such a bias\nwithin the uncertainty of the energy scale. The fiducial\nuncertainty arising from a vertex bias is therefore 2.3%.\nWe conservatively add those two numbers in quadrature\nto obtain 3.0% for the uncertainty of the fiducial volume.\nThe energy scale uncertainty of the 1KT is estimated\nby using cosmic ray muons which stopped inside of the\ndetector and the reconstructed \u03c0 0 mass which mostly\ncomes from neutral current interactions. The absolute\nenergy uncertainty of the 1KT is estimated to be +3%\n\u22124% .\nThis energy uncertainty affects N1KT because of the\nFADC cut. We changed the threshold of the FADC and\nthe effect of energy scale uncertainty is estimated to be\n0.3%. The FADC charge is calibrated by the total charge\nrecorded by ATM using single interaction events with a\nlower threshold (200 p.e.).

We take 2.0% for the uncertainty of the event rate stability from the root-meansquare (RMS) of the distribution. A comparison between\nthe event rates of the 1KT and the MRD is shown in the\nlower figure of Fig. 19 as a consistency check. We assign\nstatistical errors as systematic errors for the background\nand multiple interaction corrections due to the limited\nnumbers of the sample. In total, we quote a \u00b14.1% error\non the number of 1KT neutrino events over the entire\nK2K run.\n\nNeutrino beam stability\n\nThe neutrino beam properties\u2013 the profile, beam direction, energy spectrum and event rate\u2013 are monitored\nby the MRD using \u03bd\u03bc interactions with iron in order to\nguarantee stability of the beam for the entire run period.\nA neutrino event is identified by a muon track in the\nMRD with the following selection criteria: only tracks\nwithin the time of the beam spill are accepted; tracks\nwith a common vertex and a common timing are taken\nas a single event with the longest track assumed to be\na muon; muons entering or exiting the detector are removed; and muons which traverse one or more iron plates\n(Nlayer \u2265 1) are selected.\nThe neutrino beam profile is obtained by measuring\nthe vertex distribution in the MRD. The location of\nthe center of the profile gives the beam direction. For\nthis purpose, any muons with reconstructed energy lower\nthan 0.5 GeV or higher than 2.5 GeV are rejected and\na cubic fiducial volume of 6m \u00d7 6m in the upstream 9\niron plates is used, which has a total mass of 419 tons.\nAs shown in Fig. 20, the profile is well reproduced by the\nMC simulation. The profile center is plotted as a function\nof time in Fig. 21. The beam direction has been stable\nthroughout the experiment within \u00b11 mrad from the SK\ndirection. This satisfies the requirement for the direction\nto be within \u00b13 mrad, which is described in Section II.\nThe stability of the profile width is also confirmed by the\nmeasurement.\nThe muon energy and angular distributions are also\ncontinuously monitored. A cylindrical fiducial volume of\nradius 3m in the upstream 9 plates is used, where the\nmass is 329 tons. They show no change as a function\nof time beyond statistical uncertainty. The muon energy distribution and the angular distribution are plotted monthly in Fig. 22 and Fig. 23, respectively. These\nresults show that the \u03bd\u03bc energy spectrum is stable within\n2-4% depending on the energy bin. This is well within\nthe spectrum error quoted in the spectrum analysis described in Section VII.\nIn order to check the 1KT event rate and to compare\nthe neutrino cross sections in iron and water, the neutrino event rate in the MRD iron is derived. The fiducial\nmass used is 72.8 tons, which is the 3m-radius cylinder\nof the upstream three iron plates only. For this purpose,\nNlayer \u2265 2 is required in order to reduce the hadronic\nbackground. The stability of the 1KT event rate divided by the MRD rate is plotted in the bottom figure of\nFig. 19.\nSince the absolute normalization is less certain,\na double ratio of the MRD and 1KT event rates\nis calculated for the cross-section comparison between iron and water.\nThe result for this double ratio is (data/MC)MRD /(data/MC)1KT = 1.04 \u00b1\n0.003(stat.)+0.08\n\u22120.11 (sys.). The average event rates for MRD\nand 1KT data for the entire K2K run (except for K2K-Ia)\nare used.

In each detector we perform a search for \u03bde interactions by looking for events with an electron in the\nfinal state. \"Electron\" events come essentially only from\nthe \u03bde component of the beam, since the \u03bde /\u03bd\u03bc flux ratio\nis about 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 , while the \u03bd e /\u03bd\u03bc flux ratio is about\n1.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and the cross section for \u03bd\u03bc e scattering is\nabout a factor 1.5\u00d710\u22124 smaller than that for \u03bd\u03bc CC scattering on a nucleon. The measurement of the \u03bde events\nvalidates the prediction of the \u03bde /\u03bd\u03bc flux ratio at the\nnear location obtained from the beam MC simulation.\nThe data-MC comparison also involves the cross-sections\nof \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc interactions, and the measurement is therefore an important check of the MC simulation used to\npredict the number of \u03bde interactions in SK.\nThe LG measurement [65] is performed by looking for\n\u03bde interactions taking place in the SciFi detector, with\nthe electron detected in the downstream scintillator hodoscope, and its energy measured in the LG calorimeter. Electron events are selected by requiring the following: an interaction vertex inside the SciFi fiducial\nvolume, an energy deposit in the downstream scintilla-\n\ntor hodoscope system greater than 20 MeV (2.5 times\nlarger than that expected from a muon), an energy deposit in the LG greater than 1 GeV; and finally, no hit\nin the MRD matching the electron direction. For an exposure of 2.9 \u00d7 1019 POT, 51 electron candidates are\nfound with an estimated background of 24 \u03bd\u03bc induced\nevents. The \u03bde /\u03bd\u03bc interaction ratio is estimated to be\n1.6 \u00b1 0.4(stat.)+0.8\n\u22120.6 (syst.)%, which is in agreement with\nthe beam MC prediction of 1.3%. The dominant source\nof the \u03bde -induced component of CC interactions is muon\ndecay (87%) in the beam, and the remainder comes from\nkaon decay.\nThe measurement of the \u03bde contamination in the beam\nhas also been performed using the SciBar plus EC detector, with a statistics corresponding to 2.1 \u00d7 1019 POT.\nThe search for electrons is mainly based on the signals\nfrom the EC, the electromagnetic calorimeter which follows the tracking section of the SciBar. The two planes of\nthe EC correspond to approximately 5.5 radiation lengths\n(X0 ) each, so that electrons in the 1 GeV energy range\nare almost fully contained. The average energy lost by\na muon or pion traversing one plane is small, of the order of 50 MeV (with \u223c 60 MeV full width). Therefore,\nto look for electrons we select events with a large signal\nin a restricted region of the first EC plane. We require\nE1 > 350 MeV, where E1 is the energy in a cluster of\n20 cm width centered in the module with maximum signal. We also apply conditions on the energy release E2\nin the 20 cm wide cluster of highest energy of the second\nplane of the EC. We require E2 /E1 to lie in the 0.2-1.1\ninterval, which from MC simulation we know to contain\n95% of the electron events. In the tracking volume of the\nSciBar we search for a reconstructed track pointing to\nthe selected high energy clusters in the two projections\nof the EC. The efficiency for reconstructing the electron\nas a track in the SciBar is high, given the low density of\nthe detector (X0 = 40 cm). Finally, we impose a fiducial volume cut on the interaction vertex, defined as the\nstarting point of the electron track, and we also require\nthat outside the selected cluster the energy in each EC\nplane does not exceed 30 MeV.\nThe selected sample consists of 42 electron candidate\nevents. The visual examination of the display of these\nevents allows us to discard 9 events, easily identified as\nbackground from neutrino interactions originating outside the fiducial volume of the SciBar, or as interactions\nwith \u03c0 0 production. From the number of \u03c0 0 events identified at the scanning level we can estimate, with a correction obtained from a MC simulation, the number of\n\u03c0 0 events which cannot be distinguished from electron\nevents, and constitute an irreducible background. Our final sample, with 90% electron purity, contains 33 events,\nwith a background estimate of 3 \u00b1 2 events. The characteristics of the selected events are compared to those of\nMC events resulting from a full simulation of \u03bde interactions in the SciBar and including also a 10% background\nfrom \u03bd\u03bc interactions. The data-MC comparison is fair,\nexcept for an excess of high energy electrons in the data.\n\n\f24\ndistributions of p\u03bc versus \u03b8\u03bc are used to measure the neutrino energy spectrum. The spectrum is fitted by using\na \u03c72 method to compare observed (p\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bc ) distributions\nto MC expectations.\n\nEvents / 400MeV\n\n16\n14\n12\n10\n\nA.\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n0\n\n1000\n2000\n3000\nE(electron) (MeV)\n\n8000\n\nFIG. 24: Electron energy spectrum for the candidates of \u03bde interactions selected in SciBar. The MC spectrum (histogram)\nis normalized to the data separately for signal (30 events) and\nbackground (3 events). The contents of the highest energy bin\nis integrated between 3.6 and 8 GeV.\n\nThe energy spectrum of the electrons is shown in Fig. 24.\nThe electron energy is obtained by correcting the energy\nmeasured in the EC for the energy lost in the tracking\nsection of the SciBar and for the longitudinal leakage, the\naverage correction being of the order of 20%. The excess\nmay indicate an underestimate of kaon production in the\nbeam simulation, but the statistics is too small to draw\nfirm conclusions. Finally, we use the MC simulation to\nextrapolate our measurement, which is only sensitive to\nelectron energies larger than 500 MeV, to the full energy\nrange. Our result for the interaction ratio \u03bde CC/\u03bd\u03bc CC\nis 1.6 \u00b1 0.3(stat.) \u00b1 0.2(syst.)%, consistent with the MC\nprediction of 1.3%.\nThe consistency of the measurements in the LG and\nSciBar between themselves and with the MC predictions\nconfirms the quality of the measurements and of the MC\nsimulation. However, since the measurements are limited to a restricted energy region, for all the analyses\ndescribed in the paper we use the \u03bde component as given\nby the MC simulation.\n\nThe fitting method\n\nIn order to obtain the neutrino energy spectrum, the\n(p\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bc ) distribution is fit with the MC expectation as\nshown in Fig. 25. The neutrino energies are divided into\neight bins as shown in Table IX. For the MC expectation, the (p\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bc ) distribution is prepared for each E\u03bd\nbin and separately for QE and nonQE interactions; 8 \u00d7 2\ndistributions are prepared in total for each event sample.\nThe free parameters in the fit are the neutrino energy\nspectrum parameters for eight energy bins (f1\u03c6 , ..., f8\u03c6 )\nand a parameter, RnQE , which represents the relative\nweighting of CC-nonQE events to CC-QE events. The\nsystematic uncertainties, such as nuclear effects, the energy scale, the track finding efficiency, and other detector\nrelated systematics, are also incorporated as the fitting\nparameters (f ). The contents in (m, n)-th bin of the\nMC\n(p\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bc ) distribution, Nm,n\n, is expressed with the 16 templates and the fitting parameters as,\n\nMC\nNm,n\n\u2261P*\n\n8\nX\ni=1\n\ni\nh\nMC(nQE)\nMC(QE)\n,\nfi\u03c6 * Nm,n,i + RnQE * Nm,n,i\n\nMC(QE)\n\n(9)\n\nMC(nQE)\n\nare a normalizaand Nm,n,i\nwhere P , Nm,n,i\ntion parameter, the number of expected contents in the\n(m, n)-th bin for QE interaction and that for non-QE interaction for the i-th neutrino energy bin. We take the\nobs\nMC\n\u03c72 between the observed distributions, Nm,n\n, and Nm,n\n.\nDuring the fit, the flux in each energy bin and RnQE\nare re-weighted relative to the nominal values in the MC\nsimulation. The flux for E\u03bd = 1.0 \u2212 1.5 GeV bin is fixed\nto unity for the normalization, and another set of parameters is prepared for relative normalization of each\ndetector.\nThe \u03c72 functions are separately defined for each detector and then summed to build a combined \u03c72 function\nas\n\u03c72ND = \u03c721KT + \u03c72SF + \u03c72SB\n\nVII.

In addition to the 1KT\nevent rate selection (see Section VI.A), we require four\nadditional conditions. These are that all visible particles are inside the 1KT detector (fully contained), one\nCherenkov ring is found (one-ring), the particle identification is a muon (\u03bc-like), and the reconstructed muon\nmomentum is greater than 200 MeV/c. This last condition is to ensure the quality of the event reconstruction.\nAfter these cuts, the fraction of CCQE events is about\n60%. See Table X for the data summary and CCQE fraction. The requirement of full containment in the 1KT\nsuppresses events at high momentum compared to the\nother detectors. Figs. 26, 27, and 28 show the ring number likelihood, particle identification likelihood, and the\nfully contained versus partially contained event (FC/PC)\nseparation, respectively, used in the FC1R\u03bc event selection. Any discrepancies between data and the MC simulation observed are used to estimate some of the systematic errors in the 1KT mentioned below.\nThe selected data and the MC simulation are then\nbinned into 2-dimensional distributions of muon momentum versus the scattering angle (\u03b8\u03bc ). The momentum is\ndivided into 16 100 MeV/c bins from 0 - 1600 MeV/c.\nThe scattering angle is divided into 10 bins where the\nfirst nine are in increments of 10 degrees from 0\u25e6 -90\u25e6 and\nthe final bin contains all events with the angle greater\nthan 90\u25e6 . The bins for which the expected number of\nevents is greater than 10 are used for the analysis (80\nbins in total).\nThe neutrino spectrum is derived by comparing the\nobserved data and the weighted sum of Monte Carlo expectations using a \u03c72 test.

The right plots show those for the\nMC sample separately prepared for each neutrino energy bin\nand for QE and non-QE interactions.\n\ngiven by equation 9, \u01eb is the fitting parameter for energy scale (\u01eb = 1 is a nominal value) which scales the\nmuon momentum, \u03c3m,n is the error including statistical\nand systematic errors, and \u03c3energy is the estimated uncertainty of the energy scale, +3/\u22124%.\nThe parameters fi\u03c6 , RnQE , P, and \u01eb are the fitting parameters as discussed above.\nThe systematic errors that are introduced in the fit\ncome mainly from the event selection. Those errors are\nthe ring counting likelihood, the particle identification\nlikelihood, the FC/PC cut, the event vertex and direction reconstruction, and the energy scale. The other systematic errors are from the detector calibration and the\naxial vector mass (MA ), which is used for our neutrino\ninteraction model.\n\nC.\n\nDefinition of \u03c72 for SciFi\n\nThe SciFi tracking detector can observe charged particle tracks produced in neutrino-water interactions. Since\nSciFi uses the same target material (water) as 1KT and\nSK, systematic uncertainty due to different target nuclei\nis reduced. The data taken during K2K-Ib and K2K-IIa\nperiods have been analyzed.\nWe choose charged current events in which a muon\ntrack starts from an interaction in the SciFi fiducial volume and stops in the MRD detector.

The fiducial mass is 5.59 \u00b1 0.07 metric\ntons. The primary (muon) track should match a hit in\nthe downstream scintillator hodoscope, with no matching\nhit in the upstream one. It should also match a reconstructed track which has at least penetrated one piece of\nsteel and produced hits in two layers in the MRD. The\n\nmuon momentum threshold is 675 MeV/c for period-Ib\nand 550 MeV/c for period IIa.\nFor the K2K-Ib data, to enhance sensitivity to low\nenergy neutrino interactions, we also include events in\nwhich the muon stops in the Lead Glass calorimeter (LG)\nand events which penetrate even single active layer in\nthe MRD. Here, the response of the matched LG cluster\nshould be greater than 100 MeV, which prevents proton\ntracks from being identified as muon tracks. By including these samples the p\u03bc threshold for period-Ib data is\nreduced to 400 MeV/c.\nThe number of events for each event category, together\nwith the total POT of the beam spills used for the analyses, are summarized in Table XI. In total 17,935 charged\ncurrent candidate events have been collected for the data\ncorresponding to POTSciFi=6.17\u00d71019 POT. After correcting for the changing detector configuration and efficiency, the event rate per POT was stable from month\nto month.\nIn the spectrum reconstruction, there must be one or\ntwo tracks in the event, including the muon; events with\nthree or more tracks are discarded, which amounts to\nabout 3% of the total. The two-track sample is further\n\n\f27\nTABLE XII: QE efficiency and QE purity of all events for\nK2K-I and K2K-IIa for each SciFi subsample, estimated from\nthe MC before fitting.\n\n1-track\nQE\nnonQE\ntotal\n\nQE efficiency (%) QE purity (%)\nK2K-I K2K-IIa K2K-I K2K-IIa\n39\n36\n50\n57\n5\n5\n53\n58\n2\n2\n11\n12\n46\n42\n\nsubdivided into a QE and a non quasi-elastic sample. For\nQE events, the muon momentum and muon angle are sufficient to predict the angle of the recoil proton because of\nthe simple two-body kinematics. If the observed second\ntrack matches this prediction, within 25 degrees, then it\nis likely the event is QE. If the second track is more than\n25 degrees from the predicted angle, then it is very likely\nnot a QE event, as shown in Fig. 29.\n\nNumber of Events\n\n250\n\n\u03bc\n\n200\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u2206\u0398 Pe\n\nxp.\n\nP\n\n150\n\nP\n\nob\n\ns.\n\n100\n\nQE\n\n50\n0\n\n0\n\nnon-QE\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n\u2206\u0398P(deg.)\n\nFIG. 29: Example of the distribution of \u2206\u03b8P , the difference\nbetween the observed and predicted (assuming QE interaction) angle of the second track. This distribution is for SciFi\n2-track events for the K2K-I period. The data (circles) and\nMC (histogram) are compared, and the shaded region shows\nthe QE fraction in the MC.\n\nThe above data sample gives three subsamples each for\nK2K-I and K2K-IIa. Tab. XII shows the QE efficiency\n(fraction of QE MC events ending up in each subsample)\nand QE purity (fraction of events in the subsample which\nare QE) for K2K-I and K2K-IIa. The LG stopping events\nare separated from the rest of the K2K-I data, giving another three subsamples \u2013 a total of nine. These samples\nare then divided into seven angle bins from 0 to 60 degrees, in 10 degree increments, and also into eight muon\nmomentum bins, which have the same intervals as the\nneutrino energy bins in Tab. IX. The kinematics of these\n\ninteractions are such that the bins at both high angle and\nhigh momentum contain neither data nor MC events and\nare not used in the analysis. The high muon thresholds\nalso mean there are no data in the lowest energy region,\nand it is also not used in the fit.\nIn addition to the energy spectrum and RnQE parameters, the fit includes several systematic parameters specific to the SciFi detector. Three refer to uncertainties in\nthe reconstructed energy of each event. Since the muon\nmomentum is reconstructed from the range of the muon,\nuncertainty in the material assay, and in the dE/dx used\nin the GEANT Monte Carlo simulation, as well as the uncertainty in the outgoing muon energy from a neutrino\ninteraction, are important. A muon energy scale paramSF\neter PEscale\nwith an uncertainty of \u00b12.7% is applied to\nthe measured muon momenta. The second parameter\nSF\nPLG\u2212density\naccounts for an uncertainty of \u00b1 5% in the\nmuon energy loss specifically when it passes through the\nLG, and we consider this to be an uncertainty in the LG\ndensity. A final energy scale applies only to the energy\nreconstructed from the visible energy clusters in the LG\nfor LG stopping events. This is expressed as the paramSF\neter PLG\u2212cluster\nand is given as an energy shift in GeV.\nThe uncertainty used in the fit for the LG cluster energy\ncalibration is \u00b1 30 MeV. The muon momentum for LG\nstopping events is reconstructed only from the range in\nSciFi and the cluster energy observed in the LG.\nThere are two other systematic parameters: a\nmigration between one-track and two-track events,\nSF\nP2nd\u2212track\u2212eff\n, which accounts for the tracking efficiency\nfor short, second tracks; and a migration between the\nSF\ntwo-track QE and non-QE samples, Prescattering\n, to account for nuclear effects such as the uncertainty in the\nre-scattering of the proton as it leaves the nucleus from\na QE interaction. Both parameters are simple linear migrations, and we take a 5% uncertainty in the former and\na 2.5% uncertainty in the latter. They move a fraction\nof events from a particular p\u03bc and \u03b8\u03bc bin from one of the\nthree subsamples to the same bin in another of the three\nsubsamples.\nThere are 286 bins of SciFi data included in the fit,\nand six SciFi specific systematic parameters including\nSF\nnormalization PNorm\n. Our \u03c72 is defined as the negative\nof the logarithm of the Poisson likelihood for the binned\ndata, plus \u03c72 terms arising from the pull of five systematic errors (but not normalization):\n\u03c72 = \u22122 ln \u03bb(\u03b8)\nX\nMC\nobs\nobs\nobs\nMC\n= 2\n[Nm,n\n(\u03b8) \u2212 Nm,n\n+ Nm,n\nln(Nm,n\n/Nm,n\n(\u03b8))]\nm,n\n\n+ \u03c72Escale + \u03c72LG\n\n+\n\n2\ndensity + \u03c7LG cluster energy\n\u03c722nd track eff + \u03c72Rescattering .\n\n(12)\n\nMC\nobs\nin which Nm,n\n(\u03b8) and Nm,n\nare the predicted and observed values in the (m,n)-th bin for some values of the\nparameters \u03b8. This is the simplified version given in\nRef. [21] and its minimum follows a \u03c72 distribution. To\nthis, we add \u03c72 terms arising from the systematic errors.\n\n\f28\nTABLE XIII: Number of observed events in each event category and the efficiency and purity of the QE events estimated\nwith the MC simulation for the SciBar detector.\n# events QE efficiency (%) QE purity (%)\n1-track\n7256\n50.0\n57.8\nQE\n1760\n15.4\n71.3\nnQE\n2014\n3.7\n15.9\nTotal\n11030\n69.1\n-\n\na Gaussian distribution.

The fiducial volume of\nSciBar is defined as a rectangle that extends 2.6 \u00d7 2.6 m2\naround the beam axis, from the second to 53rd layer\nof scintillator. The fiducial mass is 9.38 tons. Events\nwith any track starting in the SciBar fiducial volume\nand matched with a track or hits in the MRD are selected as CC candidates (SciBar-MRD sample). This\nrequirement imposes a threshold of 450 MeV/c on p\u03bc ,\nreconstructed from its range through SciBar and MRD.\nAccording to the MC simulation, 98% of the events selected by this requirement are CC induced events, and\nthe rest are neutral current (NC) interactions accompanied by a charged pion or proton which penetrates into\nthe MRD. The p\u03bc resolution, p\u03bc scale uncertainty and \u03b8\u03bc\nresolution are 80 MeV/c, 2.7% and 1.6 degrees, respectively.\nEvents with one or two reconstructed tracks are selected from the SciBar-MRD sample. The two-track\nevents are subdivided into two categories - QE samples\nand nonQE samples - by using kinematic information,\n\u2206\u03b8p , like SciFi. The number of observed events and the\nfraction and efficiency of QE interactions estimated with\nthe MC simulation for each event category are summarized in Table XIII.\nThe SciBar term of the \u03c72 consists of two components,\n\n\u03c72SB = \u03c72dist + \u03c72syst .\n\n(13)\n\nThe \u03c72dist is calculated by the binned likelihood method\nusing the (p\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bd ) distribution. The bin widths are\n0.1 GeV/c for p\u03bc and 10 degrees for \u03b8\u03bc . Bins with the\nexpected number of events greater than five are used for\nthe fit. In total, 239 bins are used for the analysis. The\nobs\n, is assumed\nnumber of observed events in each bin, Nm,n\nMC\nto follow a Poisson distribution with the mean Nm,n\n. A\nbin-by-bin systematic uncertainty on hadron contamination is implemented by the convolution of a Poisson with\n\nNorm\nSB\nP1track\n= PNorm\nNorm\nSB\nSB\nPQE\n= PNorm\n* P2trk/1trk\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nSB\nNorm\nSB\nSB\n* PnonQE/QE\nPnonQE\n= PNorm\n* P2trk/1trk\n\n(18)\n\nSB\nwhere PNorm\nis the overall normalization factor, and\nSB\nSB\nP2trk/1trk\nand PnonQE/QE\nare the parameters to vary\nthe ratio of the number of 2-track events to that of 1track events and the ratio of the number of CC-nonQE\nevents to that of CC-QE events, respectively, within their\nsystematic uncertainties. We consider the uncertainties\nfrom nuclear effects and detector systematics. The possible difference between carbon and oxygen is included in\nthe nuclear effect uncertainty. Because the nuclear effects\nSB\nare common source of the uncertainties for P2trk/1trk\nand\nSB\nPnonQE/QE , their correlation is also estimated. In addiSB\ntion, Pp\u2212scale\nis introduced to account for the uncertainty\nof the energy scale of the muon reconstruction. The momentum scale uncertainty is 2.7% as described above.\nThe \u03c72syst is calculated with constraint parameters, including their correlation:\n\n\u03c72syst = (Psyst \u2212 P0 )t V \u22121 (Psyst \u2212 P0 )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere Psyst represents a set of systematic parameters,\nP0 are their nominal values, and V is a covariance maSB\nSB\n,\ntrix.

The central values and the errors\nof the fitting parameters are summarized in Table XIV.\nAll the systematic parameters stay within their estimated\nerrors. The result of the spectrum measurement is shown\nin Fig. 30 with the prediction of the beam MC simulation.\nThe results of the measurements with individual detector data are also shown in Table XIV. In the fit with\nonly 1KT data, the energy spectrum parameters are fixed\nto their default values for the high energy region where\nthere is little or no acceptance. For the same reason,\nthe low energy region is fixed for SciFi and SciBar. All\nthe fitting parameters are in good agreement within their\nerrors each other except for RnQE .\n2\nThe p\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bc and qrec\ndistributions for the 1KT, SciFi\nand SciBar samples are shown in Fig. 31\u201333. In these\n2\nfigures, the reconstructed Q2 distributions(qrec\n) are constructed by assuming that the interaction was CC-QE\nand using the reconstructed energy under this assumption. The expected distributions of the MC simulation\nwith the best-fit parameters are also shown. The MC\nsimulation reproduces all the distributions well.\nThe discrepancy in RnQE is treated as a systematic error. However, the value of RnQE is strongly correlated\nwith the E\u03bd spectrum as well as the other systematic paSB\nrameters such as PnonQE/QE\n. In order to evaluate RnQE\nwith each detector data set under identical fitting condition, a second fit is performed. In the second fit, the\nE\u03bd spectrum and the systematic parameters, except for\nthe overall normalization, are fixed at the best fit values\nobtained with all the three detectors. The best fit value\nof RnQE for each detector in the second fit is (1KT, SciFi,\nSciBar) = (0.76, 0.99, 1.06), respectively, while the fit result with three detectors is 0.96. Therefore, an additional\nerror of 0.20 is assigned to RnQE in order to account for\nthe discrepancy.\nThe errors of the measurement are provided in the form\nof an error matrix. Correlations between the parameters\nare taken into account in the oscillation analysis with this\nmatrix. The full elements in the error matrix are shown\nin Table XV.\n\nArbitrary unit\n\n29\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\nMeasurement\n\n0.5\n\nMC (w/o reweighting)\n\n0.4\n0.3\nintegrated\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nNeutrino energy\n\n4\n\n5\n(GeV)\n\nFIG. 30: The neutrino energy spectrum measured at the near\nsite, assuming CC-QE. The expectation with the MC simulation without reweighting is also shown.\n\nIn order to select those neutrino interactions which\ncome from the accelerator at KEK, two Universal Time\nCoordinated time stamps from the worldwide GPS system are compared. Both TKEK for the KEK-PS beam\nspill start time, and TSK for the SK trigger time are\nrecorded. The time difference \u2206T = TSK \u2212TKEK \u2212T OF ,\nwhere T OF is a time of flight, is distributed from 0 and\n1.1 \u03bcsec matching the timing width of the beam spill of\nthe KEK-PS. The maximum difference of the synchronization between two sites is measured to be less than\n200 ns by using an external atomic clock. For this reason\nwe require the \u2206T for selected events to be between -0.2\nto 1.3 \u03bc sec.\nIn addition to the timing criteria, the following cuts\nare required:\n1. In order to remove decay-electrons from the sample,\nevents must have no activity in the 30 \u03bcs before the\nevent.\n2. There must be a minimum number of photoelectrons seen within a 300 ns timing window.\nThe required number of photo-electrons are 200 for\nK2K-I and 94 for K2K-II.\n3. Fully contained events are selected by requiring no\nactivity in the outer detector.\n\nVIII.\nA.\n\nSK DATA\n\nSK data reduction\n\nBeam-induced neutrino events in SK are selected according to criteria described in this section. Following\nselection, events which are fully contained in the SK fiducial volume are reconstructed using similar methods to\nthe SK atmospheric neutrino analysis and then used in\nthe K2K oscillation analysis.\n\n4. A selection is made to remove events with PMTs\nwhich sometimes begin to produce light because\nof a discharge around the dynode. These events\nhave easily identified characteristics such as a timing distribution which is much broader than neutrino events, and a repeating pattern of light in the\ndetector.\n5.

Fig. 37 shows the\nvisible energy distribution, which is estimated from the\nenergy deposit in the inner detector for all of the fully\ncontained fiducial volume events. In this figure, the observed data is compared with the MC expectation based\non the ND measurement without neutrino oscillation.\nFigure 38 shows the expected energy spectrum together with the observation for the one-ring \u03bc-like events.\nThe expectation is normalized by the number of observed\nevents (58). The neutrino energy is reconstructed using the reconstructed muon momentum and the known\nbeam-direction while assuming there was a QE interaction and ignoring the Fermi momentum. As can be seen,\ncompared to the MC expectation there is a deficit of 1R\u03bc\nevents in the low energy region, as is expected from the\noscillation hypothesis.\n\nB.\n\nSystematic error from reconstruction at SK\n\nThe systematic uncertainties for estimating NSK and\nthe reconstructed neutrino energy in SK are evaluated using atmospheric neutrinos as a control sample.\nTab.

Systematic errors due to reconstruction are\nshown in table XIX. Uncertainties coming from the ring\ncounting and particle identification are evaluated by comparing the likelihood distributions for data and MC, and\nvarying the selection criteria. Figure 39 and 40 show the\nring counting and particle identification likelihood distributions of atmospheric neutrino data compared with\nthe MC expectations in SK-II. The MC expectations reproduce the data well. The uncertainty for the energy\nscale are also estimated by using cosmic ray muons, the\n\u03c0 0 invariant mass and decay electrons. The energy scale\nuncertainty at SK is estimated to be 2.0% for K2K-I and\n2.1% for K2K-II.\n\nTABLE XIX: Systematic errors for reconstructed neutrino\nenergy spectrum.

Thus, the likelihood function is defined as the\nproduct of the likelihoods for the observed number of\nevents in the SK fiducial volume (Lnorm ) and the shape\nof the E\u03bdrec spectrum (Lshape ). In addition, the systematic uncertainties are also treated as fitting parameters\nin the likelihood.

The event rate is calculated separately for each of the three interaction types\nand then summed. The neutrino flux at SK, \u03a6SK , is estimated from the F/N flux ratio RF/N and the measured\nND spectrum \u03a6ND :\n\nWe estimate the expected number of events without\nneutrino oscillation while incorporating all of the known\nsystematic uncertainties by use of a MC technique. Many\nsets of the systematic parameters are randomly generated\nwith proper consideration of their correlation. For each\nSK\nsystematic parameter set, Nexp\nis calculated using Equation (22), setting oscillation parameters to zero. The\nnumber of FC events without neutrino oscillation is estimated to be 158.1+9.2\n\u22128.6 . This technique allows us to\ndetermine the contributions from the individual systematics to the the total error by selectively including only\nsome errors during the generation.

(1).\nThe uncertainties of \u03a6ND and their correlation are obtained from the ND analysis as shown in Tab. XV. Those\nfor RF/N are derived from the HARP \u03c0 + measurement\nand the beam MC simulation, and are summarized in\nTab. V. In order to be insensitive to the absolute crosssection uncertainty, we incorporate the uncertainties in\nneutrino-nucleus cross-section as the cross-section ratio\nrelative to CC-QE interactions. The uncertainty of the\nCC-nonQE/CC-QE cross-section ratio is taken from the\nND measurements. For the NC/CC-QE cross-section\nratio, we assign 11% uncertainty to NC single \u03c0 0 production based on the measurement with the 1KT [67].\nThe other NC interaction modes are assigned 30% uncertainty based on past experiments [68]. Taking into\naccount the detection efficiency in SK, 15% is assigned\nas the net uncertainty on NC/CC-QE ratio. The uncertainties from event reconstruction at SK are summarized\nin Tab. XVIII. The uncertainty of the overall normalization of the number of events in each period is estimated\nfrom the fiducial mass error of 1KT and SK and the uncertainty in the difference of the number of protons on\ntarget used for the analysis. In total, the normalization\nerror is estimated to be \u00b15.1% for both Ib and II periods.\nFor the period Ia, the beam configuration is different\nfrom other periods and we do not have a ND measurement of the energy spectrum. We employ different treatment of the systematic errors for this period. All the\nuncertainties, including those from the F/N flux ratio,\nenergy spectrum and cross-section, are incorporated into\nthe error of the single normalization parameter. The\ntotal normalization uncertainty for the Ia period is estimated to be +9.0/-9.8%. The largest contribution to\nthis uncertainty is from the energy spectrum, which is estimated with the HARP \u03c0 + measurement and the beam\nMC simulation and gives +5.8%/\u22127.0%. Other contributions come from the F/N flux ratio (\u00b14.3%) and the\nfiducial volume uncertainties of 1KT (\u00b14.3%) and SK\n(\u00b13.0%).\n\n2.\n\nReconstructed neutrino energy spectrum\n\nThe expected spectrum shape of the reconstructed\nrec\nneutrino energy at SK, \u03c6SK\nexp (E\u03bd ), is calculated as:\n\n\u03c6SK\nexp\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nrec\ndE\u03bd * \u03a6SK (E\u03bd ) * \u03c3(E\u03bd ) * \u01ebSK\n1R\u03bc (E\u03bd ) * r(E\u03bd ; E\u03bd ),\n\n(23)\nwhere \u01ebSK\nis\nthe\ndetection\nefficiency\nfor\n1R\u03bc\nevents\nin\n1R\u03bc\nSK and r(E\u03bd ; E\u03bdrec ) is the probability of reconstructing\nan event with true energy E\u03bd as E\u03bdrec . Both of them\nare estimated with the MC simulation. In the actual\nprocedure, the E\u03bd and E\u03bdrec are binned with an interval\nof 50 MeV, and hence the integral over the true neutrino\nenergy is replaced by a summation over true energy bins.\nThe uncertainties from the neutrino energy spectrum\nat the ND, the F/N flux ratio, and the cross-section ratios are incorporated as described above. The uncertainties from 1R\u03bc event reconstruction at SK are shown in\nTab. XIX. The energy scale uncertainty in SK is 2.1%\nfor SK-I and 2.0% for SK-II, respectively, as described in\nsection VIII B.\nThe expected E\u03bdrec spectrum shape for null oscillation\ncase and its error are estimated using the same technique\nas the number of events and shown in Fig. 41. The height\nof the box represents the size of estimated error in each\nbin.

The values of all systematic parameters at the best fit point\nare within 1\u03c3 of their estimated errors. At this point,\nthe expected number of events is 107.2, which agrees\nwell with the 112 observed within the statistical uncertainty. The observed E\u03bdrec distribution is shown in Fig. 43\ntogether with both the expected distributions for the\nbest-fit parameters, and the expectation without oscillations. The consistency between the observed and the\nbest-fit E\u03bdrec distributions is checked using a KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) test. For the best fit parameters, the KS\nprobability is 37 %, while for the null oscillation hypothesis is 0.07 %. The observation agrees with the expectation\nof neutrino oscillation. The highest likelihood is found at\n(\u2206m2 , sin2 2\u03b8) = (2.6 \u00d7 10\u22123eV2 , 1.2), which is outside of\nthe physical region. The probability that we would get\nsin2 2\u03b8 \u2265 1.2 if the true parameters are at our best fit\npoint is 26.2%, based on the virtual MC experiments.\n18\n\nTABLE XX: Summary of the null oscillation probability.\nEach row is classified by the likelihood term used, and each\ncolumn represents the data set.\nK2K-I+II\nK2K-I only K2K-II only\nShape + Norm. 0.0015% (4.3\u03c3) 0.18% (3.1\u03c3) 0.56% (2.8\u03c3)\nShape only\n0.42% (2.9\u03c3)\n7.7%\n5.2%\nNorm. only\n0.06% (3.4\u03c3)\n0.6%\n2.8%\n\nTABLE XXI: Effect of each systematic uncertainty on the\nnull oscillation probability.

Points with error bars are data. The solid line is\nthe best fit spectrum with neutrino oscillation and the dashed\nline is the expectation without oscillation. These histograms\nare normalized by the number of events observed (58).\n\nThe probability that the observations can be explained\nequally well by the no oscillation and by the oscillation\nhypotheses is estimated by computing the difference of\nlog-likelihood between the null oscillation case and the\nbest fit point with oscillation. The null oscillation probability is calculated to be 0.0015 % (4.3\u03c3). When only\nnormalization (shape) information is used, the probability is 0.06% (0.42%).\n\nThe null oscillation probability calculated separately\nfor each sub-sample or each likelihood term is shown in\nTab. XX. In addition, Tab. XXI shows the effect of each\nsystematic uncertainty on the null oscillation probability.\nThe effect is tested by turning on the error source written\nin the first column in the table. As shown in the table,\nthe dominant contributions to the probabilities for the\nnormalization information are from the F/N flux ratio\nand the normalization error, while the energy scale is\nthe dominant error source for the probability with the\nE\u03bdrec shape information consistent with the results found\nusing the MC test described in Sec. IX B 2.\nThe allowed region of oscillation parameters are evaluated based on the difference of log-likelihood between\neach point and the best fit point:\n\n\u2206ln L(\u2206m2 , sin2 2\u03b8) \u2261 ln\n\n\u0012\n\nLphys\nmax\nL(\u2206m2 , sin2 2\u03b8)\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n2\n= ln Lphys\nmax \u2212 ln L(\u2206m , sin 2\u03b8),\n(28)\n\nwhere Lphys\nmax is the likelihood at the best-fit point and\nL(\u2206m2 , sin2 2\u03b8) is the likelihood at (\u2206m2 , sin2 2\u03b8) with\nsystematic parameters that maximize the likelihood at\nthat point.\nThe allowed regions in the neutrino oscillation parameter space, corresponding to the 68%, 90% and 99% confidence levels (CL) are shown in Fig. 44. They are defined as the contour lines with ln L = ln Lphys\nmax \u2212 1.37,\n\u22122.58 and \u22124.91, respectively.

The\n90% C.L. contour crosses the sin2 2\u03b8 = 1 axis at \u2206m2 =\n1.9 and 3.5\u00d710\u22123 eV2 .

The fit results are summarized in\nTab. XXII. There is no entry for the normalization term\nonly, because the two parameters cannot be simultaneously determined from only one number. The oscillation\nparameters allowed by the normalization and the spectrum shape alone agree with each other, as shown in both\nTab. XXII and Fig. 46. The allowed regions calculated\nwith only K2K-I and K2K-II data are also consistent as\nshown in Tab. XXII and Fig. 47.\nFinally, we compare our result with the parameters\nfound by the measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillation by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration [2]. Figure 48 shows the allowed regions of oscillation parameters\nfound in this analysis together with the SK result. The\nK2K result is in good agreement with the parameters\nfound using atmospheric neutrinos, thereby confirming\nthe neutrino oscillation result reported by SK.\n\nX.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nData taken by the K2K experiment between June 1999\nand November 2004 is used to observe and measure the\nparameters of neutrino oscillation using an acceleratorproduced neutrino beam. The K2K experiment is the\nfirst long-baseline neutrino experiment to operate at a\ndistance scale of hundreds of kilometers. The neutrinos are measured first by near detectors located approximately 300 meters from the proton target, and then by\nthe Super-Kamiokande detector 250 km away. The near\ndetector complex consists of a 1 kiloton water Cherenkov\ndetector, and a fine grained detector system. The energy\nspectrum and flux normalization measured at the near\ndetectors are used to predict the signal seen at Super-K.\nThe results found are consistent with the neutrino os-\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\nK2K full data\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n68%\n90%\n99%\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n2\n\n1\n\nsin (2\u03b8)\nFIG. 44: Allowed regions of oscillation parameters.
