This underlying diffuse interface model\nis also closely related to the functional studied in [M\u00fcl93]. Such polymers consist of two parts,\nlabelled the U and V parts, whose volume fractions are represented by the variables u and v.\nThe U and V parts of the polymers repel each other, and this repulsion leads to micro-phase\nseparation: phase separation at a length scale comparable to the length of a single molecule. The\ncase studied here is known as the strong segregation limit, [BF99], in which strong repulsion causes\nstrong demixing of the constituents-hence the restriction of K1 to characteristic functions.R The\nmodeling assumption here is that stationary points of F1 under constrained (i.e. fixed) mass RN u,\nin particular minimisers, represent the structures formed by the polymers.\n1 Where\n\nwe do not explicitly specify the integration measure, we use the Lebesgue measure.\n\n1\n\n\fAlthough the various simplifications leading to F1 have obscured the connection between this\nfunctional and single molecules, the character of the various terms is still recognisable. The\ninterfacial penalisation terms, i.e. the first three terms, are what remains of the repulsion in the\nstrong segregation limit, and these terms favour large-scale demixing. The last term ku \u2212 vkH \u22121 ,\non the other hand, penalises such large-scale separation and arises from the chemical bond between\nthe U and V parts of the polymer molecules.\nThese competing tendencies cause the functional F1 to prefer structures with a specific length\nscale, as we now illustrate with a simple example in one space dimension. For simplicity we take\nas spatial domain the unit torus T1 , i.e. the set [0, 1] with periodic boundary conditions; all global\nminimisers under the condition u + v \u2261 1 then are of the form shown in Figure 1a.\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nz\n1\n\nu\n\n0\n\n2n\n\nv\n\nu\n\n}|\n\nv\n\nu\n\nv\n\n{\n\n1\n\nz\n\nu\n\n1\n\n0\n\n(a) n-block structure on the unit torus T1 , with u+v \u2261 1\n\nFigure 1:\n\nv\n\nu\n\n2n\n}|\n\nv\n\nu\n\n{\n\nv\n\n1\n\n(b) n-block structure on R or T1\n\nFor such structures the value of the functional is\nF1 = 2n(cu + cv ) +\n\n1\n,\n96n2\n\nas can be seen from the results in Section 3. If we consider cu and cv to be fixed, the energy F1\nis clearly minimised at a finite value of n. When we study the one-dimensional case on R without\nthe restriction u + v \u2261 1 in more detail, in Section 3, we shall see that the energy actually favours\na specific block width rather than a specific number of blocks.\n\n1.2\n\nBlends of co- and homopolymers\n\nFor u + v 6\u2261 1, F1 is a model for blends, mixtures of diblock copolymers and homopolymers; the\nhomopolymer is considered to fill the space not occupied by the diblock copolymer and has local\nvolume fraction 1 \u2212 u \u2212 v.\nThe inclusion of homopolymers into a block copolymer melt opens the possibility of structures\nwith two distinct length scales. The repulsion between the two blocks creates micro-phase separation at the length scale of the polymer, as described above. At a larger length scale structures\nare observed in which regions of pure homopolymer and pure copolymer alternate.\nBlend systems show a tremendous wealth of behaviour. For instance, many different types\nof macrodomain geometry have been observed: spheres [KHH94, ON97, UD05, ZJM05], cylinders [KWT88], dumbbells [OI95], helices [HMY+ 01], labyrinths and sponges [LSHG94, Ito98,\nOI95], ball-of-thread [LSHG94], and many more. In addition, the microdomains have varying orientation with respect to this macrodomain geometry. In many cases the micro- and macrodomain\ngeometry appear to be coupled in ways that are not yet understood.\nThere is extensive literature on such blend systems, which is mostly experimental or numerical.\nFor the numerical experiments it is de rigeur to apply a self-consistent mean field theory and\nobtain a generalisation of the Ohta-Kawasaki [OK86] model (see e.g. [NH83, ON97, CR05]). Of\nthe resulting model the energy F1 is a sharp-interface limit [Bal90, CR05].\nAt the level of mathematical analysis, however, little is known. What form do global and local\nminimisers of F1 take? (Do they even exist? The issue of existence of global minimisers of F1\non R is first addressed in this paper.) Does the functional indeed have a preference for layered\nstructures, as the numerical experiments suggest? What structure and form can macrodomains\nhave? Can we observe in this simplified functional F1 the breadth of behaviour that is observed\nin experiments? All these questions are open, and in this paper we provide some first answers.\n2\n\n\f1.3\n\nResults: global minimisers in one dimension under constrained mass\n\nThe first part of the paper focuses on the one-dimensional situation.\n1.3.1\n\nExistence\n\nThe existence of global minimisers under the constraint of fixed mass follows mostly from classical\narguments (proof of Theorem 3.7). The non-compactness of the set R can be remedied with the\ncut-and-paste techniques that we introduce to study non-uniqueness (see below).\nOne non-trivial issue arises when e.g. c0 = cu = 0, in which case the functional F1 provides no\ncontrol on the regularity of u. We obtain weak convergence in L2 for a minimising sequence, and\ntherefore a priori we can only conclude that the value set of the limit functions is [0, 1], the convex\nhull of {0, 1}; as a result the limit (u, v) need not be an element of K1 . With a detailed study of\nthe stationarity conditions on u we show that stationary points of F1 only assume the extremal\nvalues 0 and 1. The existence of a minimiser then follows from standard lower semi-continuity\narguments.\n1.3.2\n\nCharacterisation of macrodomains\n\nIn the one-dimensional situation a macrodomain is a finite sequence of alternating U- and V'blocks' or 'layers' as in Figure 1b. Choksi and Ren [CR05] studied such macrodomains defined on\nthe torus TL of length L, but their techniques apply unchanged to the real line also. They showed\nthat if such a macrodomain is stationary, then all interior blocks have equal width, while the end\nblocks are thinner.\nThe exact dimensions of the blocks are fully determined by the number of blocks, the total\nmass, and, in the case of the torus, the size of the domain (see Theorems 3.2 and 3.3). It is\ninstructive to minimise F1 within classes defined by a specific choice of the sequence of U- and\nV-blocks; Figure 2 shows this minimal energy for different classes and different values of the mass.\nPSfrag replacements F\n1\n\nM\n\na\n\n5\n\nbc\n\nd\n\n4\ne\nf\n\n73\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nM\n\nFigure 2: Energy per unit mass for the one-dimensional case R, according to the calculations in\nSection 3.5. M is the total U-mass; for the surface tension parameters (see Lemma 2.3) the values\ndu0 = 1, duv = 0.7 and dv0 = 0.3 are chosen. The graphs belong to the following structures, as\nindicated in the figure as well (the lighter coloured blocks are V-blocks, the darker ones U-blocks):\n(a) UV and VU, (b) UVU, (c) VUV, (d) UVUV and VUVU, (e) UVUVU, (f) VUVUV. The circle\nindicates where the optimal structure changes.\n\n3\n\n\f1.3.3\n\nCharacterisation of constrained minimisers\n\nWe extend the results of Choksi & Ren into a full characterisation of global minimisers, by showing\nthat there exists a global minimiser with only one macrodomain, and by fully characterising all\nother global minimisers in terms of the parameters and the morphology (Theorem 3.7).\nThis characterisation shows that non-uniqueness of minimisers can take two different forms.\nThe first is the possibility that two different UV-sequences with the same mass have the same\nenergy, as is illustrated by the encircled intersection in Figure 2. This is a common occurrence in\nvariational problems, where a parameter change causes the global minimum to switch from one\nlocal minimiser to another.\nThe second form of non-uniqueness is related to the fact, which we prove in Section 3.3, that\ntwo separate macrodomains can be translated towards each other and joined together without\nincreasing the energy. In fact, in many cases the energy strictly decreases, and it is this possibility\nof strict decrease that allows us to rule out many cases. This leaves us with a set of conditions for\nthe case of unchanged energy that must be fulfilled when a non-unique global minimiser contains\nmore than one macrodomain (see Theorem 3.7). This type of non-uniqueness is specific for the\nproblem at hand, and produces not a discrete set of minimisers but a continuum, parametrised by\nthe spacing between the macrodomains.\nAlthough the focus of this paper lies on the unbounded domains R and RN , we make a brief\nexcursion to extend the characterisation of global minimisers to the case of the torus TL with\nlength L (Theorem 3.9).\n1.3.4\n\nA lower bound\n\nFigure 2 and more clearly Figure 3 illustrate that as the imposed mass increases the number of\nblocks of the global minimiser(s) also increases. In Section 3.5 we calculate values of the energy\nfor various global minimisers, and show that the thickness of the internal layers approaches the\noptimal spacing of\n2m0 := 61/3 (cu + cv )1/3 ,\nfor M \u2192 \u221e while the width of the end layers converges to half this value (Remark 3.12).\nAs a corollary we obtain an explicit and sharp lower bound for the energy on R (Theorem 3.11):\n\u0012 \u00131/3\nZ\n9\n2/3\n(cu + cv )\nu.\nF1 (u, v) \u2265 2(c0 + min(cu , cv )) +\n2\nR\n\n(2)\n\nThe fact that the lower bound is sharp is significant. For instance, the affine dependence of the\nR\nR \u0001\u22121\nright-hand side on the mass u implies that the minimal energy per Runit of mass, F1 (u, v) u\n,\nis generically not attained at any finite mass, but only in the limit u \u2192 \u221e.\nThe word 'generic' refers here to the assumption that c0 + min(cu , cv ) > 0, and the alternative\ncase c0 = cu = 0 (or c0 = cv = 0) is fundamentally different. In this latter case macrodomains can\nbe split and joined without changing the energy.\nThe characterisation of global minimisers also allows us to establish an asymptotically sharp\nupper bound (Theorem 3.11):\n\u001a\n\u001b \u0012 \u00131/3\nZ\n9\nlim inf M \u22121 F1 (u, v) : (u, v) \u2208 K1 ,\nu=M =\n(cu + cv )2/3 .\nM\u2192\u221e\n2\n\n(3)\n\nIn the limit M \u2192 \u221e, the bound (2) coincides with (3).\n\n1.4\n1.4.1\n\nResults: higher dimensions\nEnergy bounds\n\nA common strategy in the study of pattern-forming systems is not to make any Ans\u00e4tze about\nthe morphology but to search for weaker characterisations of behaviour. As an example of this\n4\n\n\fin the field of block copolymers, Choksi proves that for pure diblock melts the energy is bounded\nfrom below by a lower bound with a certain scaling in terms of the physical parameters-without\nmaking any a priori assumptions on the morphology [Cho01]. This scaling is shared by periodic\nlamellar structures with a specific lamellar separation.\nFor the case at hand, the one-dimensional analysis provides both a lower and an upper bound\non the energy in one dimension. Weakening the lower bound (2) to\n\u0012 \u00131/3\nZ\n9\n2/3\n(cu + cv )\nu,\n(4)\nF1 (u, v) \u2265\n2\none might conjecture that the lower bound (4) holds in RN , again without making any a priori\nassumption on the morphology. However, we have no proof of this conjecture, and in fact, results\non mono- and bilayer stability (see Section 1.4.2 below) suggest that such a conjecture may only\nhold for certain choices of the parameters. In Section 4 we instead prove a lower bound which is\nalso linear in mass, but has a smaller constant (Theorem 4.1).\nThe explicit construction used to prove the upper bound (3) suggests a natural strategy for\nproving a similar upper bound in RN . In Sections 4.2 and 4.3 we extend one-dimensional minimisers as lamellar structures in RN , and prove the same upper bound (3) in RN . Here the main\nstep in the proof is the estimation that 'boundary effects' as a result of the cutoff to finite mass\nare of lower order.\nIn Section 4.3 we use the same idea to calculate the energy values of some structures with\nspherical geometry: either solid spheres of one phase (U or V) surrounded by a spherical layer of\nthe other phase (micelles), or ring-shaped layered structures. In both cases the asymptotic energy\nexceeds that given by the upper bound (3), indicating that they can not be global minimisers\nin RN .\n1.4.2\n\nMonolayer and bilayer stability in periodic strips\n\nIn a companion paper [GP07] we study the stability with respect to a certain class of perturbations\nof monolayers and bilayers, i.e. straight layered structures with one respectively two lines of U-V\ninterface, in a periodic strip TL \u00d7 R. There we show that for sufficiently large L a monolayer (the\nsimplest lamellar structure, of the form UV) is always unstable, while the stability of a bilayer\n(UVU or VUV) depends on the parameters. For the case of a UVU bilayer with optimal thickness,\nfor instance, we prove a stability criterion of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL\ncu + cv\n\u2265g\nstability\n\u21d0\u21d2\n,\nc0 + 2cu + cv\n(c0 + 2cu + cv )1/3\nwhere g is a continuous function with values in (0, 1). Therefore, the bilayer can be stable or\nunstable, depending on the relative values in the interface penalisation parameters. Note that the\nrelative value of cu + cv should not be too small in order to have stability. More about the special\nrole of cu + cv follows in Section 2.2.\n\n1.5\n\nRelated work: partial localisation\n\nIn previous work, one of the authors (Peletier) and R\u00f6ger studied a related functional whose derivation was inspired by lipid bilayers [PR06]. Lipid bilayers might be considered block copolymers,\nand therefore it is not surprising that the functional considered in [PR06] is similar to F1 :\n\uf8f1 Z\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b5\n|\u2207u| + d1 (u, v) if (u, v) \u2208 K\u03b5 ,\n\u03b5\n2\nR\n(5)\nF\u03b5 (u, v) :=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u221e\notherwise.\n\nHere u is the volume fraction or density of lipid heads, v is the volume fraction of lipid tails, d1 (*, *)\nis the Monge-Kantorovich distance and\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nZ\nv=M .\nu=\nK\u03b5 := (u, v) \u2208 BV(R2 ; {0, 1/\u03b5})2 : uv = 0 a.e., and\nR2\n\n5\n\nR2\n\n\fApart from the choices c0 = cv = 0 and cu = 1, the main difference between (1) and (5) is the\ndifferent non-local term.\nNote that the scaling (constant mass but increasing amplitude 1/\u03b5) implies that the supports\nof u and v shrink to zero measure. The main goal in [PR06] was to investigate the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0,\nand connect the limit behaviour to macroscopic mechanical properties of the lipid bilayers such\nas stretching, bending, and fracture.\nThe authors studied sequences (u\u03b5 , v\u03b5 ) for which the rescaled energy G\u03b5 := \u03b5\u22122 (F\u03b5 \u2212 2M )\nremains finite. They revealed a remarkable property of the functional G\u03b5 (or F\u03b5 ): boundedness of\nG\u03b5 (u\u03b5 , v\u03b5 ) implies that the support of u\u03b5 and v\u03b5 becomes close, in the sense of Hausdorff distance\nbetween sets, to a collection of closed curves of total length M . The curve-like behaviour indicates\npartial localisation: localisation in one direction (normal to the limit curve) and non-localisation\nin the direction of the tangent. In addition one can recognise resistance to stretching (because of\nthe fixed length) and resistance to fracture (because the curves are closed). Moreover, the curves'\nsupport is approximately of 'thickness' 2\u03b5, indicating an underlying bilayer structure. The authors\nalso showed that G\u03b5 Gamma-converges to the Elastica functional, which penalises the curvature\nof curves, showing a tendency of the limit curves to resist bending.\nThese results suggest considering similar limits for the functional F1 . In fact the subscript 1\nin F1 and K1 already refers to the appropriate rescaling:\n\u0013\n\uf8f1 \u0012 Z\nZ\nZ\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b5 c0\n|\u2207(u + v)| + cu\n|\u2207u| + cv\n|\u2207v| + ku \u2212 vk2H \u22121 if (u, v) \u2208 K\u03b5 ,\n\u03b5\nN\nN\nN\nR\nR\nR\nF\u03b5 (u, v) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u221e\notherwise,\n(6)\nwhere\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\nN 2\nv .\nu=\nK\u03b5 := (u, v) \u2208 BV(R ) : u(x), v(x) \u2208 {0, 1/\u03b5} a.e., and uv = 0 a.e., and\nRN\n\nRN\n\nAs mentioned above, in the companion paper [GP07] we investigate the stability of bilayers, and\nshow that parameter choices exist for which they are stable: this provides another suggestion that\nthe functional F\u03b5 may display similar behaviour in the limit \u03b5 \u2193 0. This is work for future research.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminary definitions\nProblem setting\n\nN\nIn this paper we mostly consider as domain the whole\nQNspace R ; however, sometimes we will make\nN\nan excursion to the torus TL , i.e. a periodic cell i=1 [0, Li ] with the endpoints of each interval\nidentified.\nR\nDefinition 2.1.

We define the space\nf\n=\n0\nwith respect\nH \u22121 (RN ) as the completion of f \u2208 L1 (RN ) : supp f compact,\nn RN\no to the norm\nR\n1\nN\nin (7). Similarly H \u22121 (TN\nf = 0 with respect\nL ) is defined as the completion of f \u2208 L (TL ) : TN\nL\nto this norm.\n\nOn TN\nL the zero average condition of f is necessary in order for G \u2217 f to respect the topology\nof the torus:\nZ\nZ\nf =\u2212\n\u2206(G \u2217 f ) = 0.\nTN\nL\n\nTN\nL\n\n6\n\n\fThis condition also allows for a convenient reformulation of the norm (7) in terms of the Poisson\npotential \u03c6f of f , given by\n\u03c6f = G \u2217 f,\n\nsuch that\n\nkf k2H \u22121 =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nf \u03c6f =\n\n|\u2207\u03c6f |2 .\n\n(8)\n\nIn some cases it will be useful to add a constant to \u03c6f ; note that this can be done without changing\nthe value in (8).\nIf the set H01 is defined\nas the completion of Cc1 (RN ) (or C 1 (TN\nL ) with zero mean) with respect\nR\n2\nto the norm kgkH 1 = |\u2207g|2 , then (7) is the dual norm of H01 with respect to the L2 -inner product\n0\nand satisfies\nZ\nf g \u2264 kf kH \u22121 kgkH01 ,\nfor all f \u2208 H \u22121 and g \u2208 H01 .\nWe repeat the definition of F1 and K1 for convenience.\n\nDefinition 2.2.

See also Remark 2.5.\nSometimes we consider the case of the torus instead of RN . It is understood that in the above\ndefinition the instances of RN are then replaced by TN\nL.\nAnother, equivalent, form of the functional will be useful, in which the penalisation of the three\ntypes of interface U-0, V-0, and U-V, is given explicitly by surface tension coefficients dkl :\nLemma 2.3. Let the surface tension coefficients be given by\ndu0 := cu + c0 ,\ndv0 := cv + c0 ,\nduv := cu + cv ,\nNon-negativity of the ci is equivalent to the conditions\n0 \u2264 dkl \u2264 dkj + djl\nThen\nF1 (u, v) =\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n\nfor each k 6= l.\n\ndu0 HN \u22121 (Su0 ) + dv0 HN \u22121 (Sv0 ) + duv HN \u22121 (Suv ) + ku \u2212 vk2H \u22121\n\u221e\n\n(9)\n\nif (u, v) \u2208 K1 ,\notherwise.\n\nwhere Skl is the interface between the phases k and l:\nSu0 = \u2202 \u2217 supp u \\ \u2202 \u2217 supp v,\n\nSv0 = \u2202 \u2217 supp v \\ \u2202 \u2217 supp u,\nSuv = \u2202 \u2217 supp u \u2229 \u2202 \u2217 supp v,\nand \u2202 \u2217 is the essential boundary of a set.\n2 The\n\nindices j, k, l take values in {u, v, 0} and the dkl are taken symmetric in their indices, i.e. dvu := duv etc.\n\n7\n\n\fRemark 2.4. The essential boundary of a set consists of all points in the set that have a density\nother than 0 or 1 in the set. Details can be found in [AFP00, Chapter 3.5].\nProof of Lemma 2.3. The main step in recognising the equivalence of both forms of F1 is noticing\nthat, if u is a characteristic function, then\nZ\n|\u2207u| = HN \u22121 (\u2202 \u2217 supp u \u2229 \u03a9).\nNote the different interpretations of the coefficients ci and the surface tension coefficients dkl .\nThe latter have a direct physical interpretation: they determine the mutual repulsion between the\ndifferent constituents of the diblock copolymer-homopolymer blend. For example, the value of duv\n(as compared to the values of du0 , dv0 and 1, the coefficient in front of the H \u22121 -norm) determines\nthe energy penalty associated with close proximity of U- and V-polymers. In particular, if one\nof these surface tension coefficients is zero, the corresponding polymers do not repel each other\nand many interfaces between their respective phases in the model can be expected. On the other\nhand the coefficients ci , when taken separately, do not convey complete information about the\npenalisation of the boundary of a phase. If for instance cu = 0, but cv 6= 0, the part of the\nU-phase interface that borders on the V-phase still receives a penalty, because duv = cv . For this\nreason the use of surface tension coefficients makes more sense from a physical point of view. For\nthe mathematics it is often easier to use the formulation in terms of ci .\nRemark 2.5. The condition (9) can be understood in several ways. If, for instance, duv >\ndu0 + dv0 , then the U-V type interface, which is penalised with a weight of duv , is unstable, for\nthe energy can be reduced by slightly separating the U and V regions and creating a thin zone\nof 0 inbetween. A different way of seeing the necessity of (9) is by remarking that the equivalent\nrequirement of non-negativity of the ci is necessary for F1 to be lower semicontinuous in e.g. the\nL1 topology. Our assumption that at least one ci is positive is equivalent to assuming that at least\ntwo dkl are positive.\n\n2.2\n\nThe role of duv\n\nThe behaviour of the model described by F1 is crucially different in the two cases duv > 0 (cu +cv >\n0) and duv = 0 (cu = cv = 0). The statements made in the introduction such as 'the functional\nF1 prefers structures with a definite length scale' actually only hold in the case duv > 0. For most\nresults in this work we will assume this condition to hold, and to justify this we now show with\nan example how the case duv = 0 is different.\nConsider the one-dimensional case, take \u03a9 to be the torus T1 , and fix c0 = 1 and cu = cv = 0,\nor equivalently duv = 0 and du0 = dv0 = 1. Restricting ourselves to functions (u, v) \u2208 K1 with\nR1\nR1\n0 u = 0 v = M , for some fixed mass 0 < M < 1/2, we find that for any (u, v) there are at least\ntwo U-0 or V-0 type transitions, and therefore\nZ 1\nF1 (u, v) =\n|(u + v)\u2032 | + ku \u2212 vk2H \u22121 \u2265 2.\n0\n\nOn the other hand, equality is only reached if u \u2212 v = 0, which is not possible for positive mass M .\nBut the value 2 can be reached by a sequence of approximating pairs (un , vn ),\n(\n2k+1\n1 |x| \u2264 n and 2k\nn < x<\nn , for some k \u2208 Z\nun (x) =\n0 otherwise\n(\n< x < 2k\n1 |x| \u2264 n and 2k\u22121\nn\nn , for some k \u2208 Z\nvn (x) =\n0 otherwise\nThen (un , vn ) \u2208 K1 and\n8\n\n\f\u2022\n\nR1\n0\n\n|(un + vn )\u2032 | =\n\nR1\n0\n\n|\u03c7\u2032[\u2212n,n] | = 2;\n\n\u2022 In Section 3 it is calculated that a single one-dimensional monolayer of width 2m and height\n1 satisfies ku \u2212 vk2H \u22121 = 2m3 /3; extending this result to the functions (un , vn ), which are\nconcatenations of n2 such monolayers, each of width 2/n, we find ku\u2212vk2H \u22121 = n2 *2n\u22123 /3 =\n2n\u22121 /3.\n\nConsequently, F1 (un , vn ) converges to 2 for n \u2192 \u221e.\nThis sequence illustrates the preferred behaviour when duv = 0: since the interfaces between\nthe U- and V-phases are not penalised, rapid alternation of U- and V-phase effectively eliminates\nthe H \u22121 -norm, reducing the energy to the interfacial energy associated with a single field u + v.\n\n3\n\nGlobal minimisers in one dimension\n\nIn this section we fully characterise the set of global minimisers of F1 in one space dimension, i.e.\nN = 1. Our main discussion concerns the case of R, but in Section 3.4 we will briefly mention\nresults on the torus TL .\nIn one space dimension it is useful to regard admissible functions (u, v) as a sequence of\nblocks. A U-block, a V-block, and a 0-block are connected components of supp u, supp v, and\nR \\ supp(u + v), respectively. Adjacent blocks are separated by transitions or interfaces. We will\nsee below (Corollary 3.6) that any stationary point has a finite number of interfaces, even if either\ndu0 or dv0 vanishes.\nIf (u, v) is an admissible pair, each of the connected components of its support supp(u + v) is\nin fact a macrodomain in the sense of the introduction. If there is only one such macrodomain, we\ncall the configuration connected. Thinking about the structures in terms of sequences of blocks,\nwe can specify connected configurations up to block width and translation by a sequence of U's\nand V's, e.g. UVUVU.\nCharacterising the set of global minimisers falls apart into two steps:\nA For a given macrodomain we describe the optimal spacing between the transitions;\nB We derive necessary conditions for the occurrence of a disconnected global minimiser, i.e. a\nglobal minimiser with more than one macrodomain.\nIn addition we use the techniques of part B above to prove the existence of a global minimiser.\nIn Section 3.2 we first describe the characterisation given by Choksi and Ren [CR05] of the internal structure of macrodomains, which essentially coincides with part A above. We then continue\nin Section 3.3 by showing that the support can be reduced to a single connected component; this\nalso provides necessary and sufficient conditions for non-uniqueness (Theorem 3.7). The reduction\nto a single macrodomain also allows us to prove an existence result (Theorem 3.7). Finally, in\nSection 3.5, we calculate the values of these minimisers and derive a lower bound for the energy\nper unit of mass.\n\n3.1\n\nStationarity\n\nBecause the set of admissible functions K1 is not locally convex we need to carefully formulate\nthe notion of stationary point.\nDefinition 3.1. We call (u, v) \u2208 K1 a stationary point of F1 if for any sequence (un , vn ) \u2282 K1\nsuch that un \u2192 u in L1 and vn \u2192 v in L1 ,\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZ\n|F1 (u, v) \u2212 F (un , vn )| = o\n|u \u2212 un | dx +\n|v \u2212 vn | dx .\n\u03a9\n\n9\n\n\u03a9\n\n\fAs a consequence of this definition, if t 7\u2192 (u(t), v(t)) is a curve in K1 , with (u(0), v(0)) a\nstationary point of F1 , then\nd\nF1 (u(t), v(t))\n= 0.\ndt\nt=0\nIn the proofs of the results in Section 3.2 a special case of this is used: for a connected configuration\nin one dimension that is stationary under constrained mass the derivative of F1 with respect to\nmass-preserving changes in the position of the interfaces is zero.\n\n3.2\n\nCharacterisation of macrodomains\n\nFor periodic domains, Choksi and Ren [CR05] have given a characterisation of the structure of\nmacrodomains. For its formulation it is useful to define three types of interface. Interfaces 0-U\nand U-0 interfaces are considered to be of the same type, as are 0-V and V-0 interfaces and U-V\nand V-U interfaces. Choksi and Ren's conclusions are\nTheorem 3.2 ([CR05]). Let (u, v) be a stationary point of F1 on the torus TL under constrained\nmass, with supp(u + v) connected and with a finite number of interfaces. Then\n1. Each pair of adjacent U-V type transitions is separated by the same amount; i.e. each U- or\nV-block is of the same width, with the exception of the two end blocks.\n2. In the cases UVUV. . . U and VUVU. . . V the end blocks are half as wide as the internal\nblocks.\n3. In the case UVUV. . . V (or the mirrored configuration VUVU. . . U) there is an additional\nrelation that determines the width of the end blocks.\nThe case of R was not explicitly discussed by Choksi and Ren, but both the result and the\nproof for this case are simpler than for the periodic cell:\nTheorem 3.3. Let (u, v) be a stationary point of F1 on R under constrained mass, with supp(u+v)\nconnected and with a finite number of interfaces. Then\n1. Each pair of adjacent U-V type transitions is separated by the same amount; i.e. each U- or\nV-block is of the same width, with the exception of the two end blocks.\n2. The end blocks are half as wide as the internal blocks.\nThe main tool in the proof of these theorems is the following lemma.\nLemma 3.4 ([CR05, Lemma 4.1]). For any stationary point under constrained mass, the Poisson\npotential \u03c6 has equal value at any two interfaces of the same type.\nThe statements about the block sizes are deduced from this lemma, and from the fact that the\npotential \u03c6 has prescribed second derivative on each block.\n\n3.3\n\nReduction to connected support\n\nWe first need a technical result to rule out the possibility of an infinity of transitions.\nLemma 3.5. Let (u, v) be a stationary point under constrained mass, let \u03a9 be either R or TL and\nlet \u03c9 \u2282 \u03a9 be an open set such that v(\u03c9) = {0}. Then \u03c9 contains at most two U-0 type transitions.\nA similar statement holds with u and v exchanged.\nProof. On \u03c9, \u03c6\u2032\u2032 \u2264 0; each U-0 or 0-U transition occurs at the same value of \u03c6 (Lemma 3.4), say\nat \u03c6 = c \u2208 R. If the set {x \u2208 \u03c9 : \u03c6(x) = c} has more than two elements, then by convexity,\n\u03c6(x) = c\n\u03c6(x) < c\n\nfor x \u2208 [x1 , x2 ],\nfor x \u2208 \u03c9 \\ [x1 , x2 ],\n\nfor some x1 < x2 \u2208 \u03c9. On (x1 , x2 ), therefore, \u03c6\u2032\u2032 = 0 and thus u = 0. Therefore there are at most\ntwo transitions connecting U and 0, at x = x1 and at x = x2 .\n10\n\n\fCorollary 3.6. If duv > 0, then a stationary point under constrained mass has a finite number\nof transitions.\nProof. By (9), at least two out of the three dij are strictly positive. If all three are positive, then\nthe finiteness of F1 implies a bound on the number of interfaces. If one is zero, say du0 , then the\nlemma above states that the number of U-0 or 0-U transitions is no larger than the number of\nV-interfaces. Since the latter is bounded, the former is also.\nTheorem 3.7. Let N = 1. Let duv > 0, and fix a mass M > 0.\n1. There exists a global minimiser under constrained mass M for which supp(u+v) is connected.\n2. This global minimiser is non-unique (apart from translation and mirroring) if and only if\n(a) the energy of this configuration is equal to the energy of another configuration (\u016b, v\u0304) for\nwhich supp(\u016b + v\u0304) is also connected, or\n(b) one of the following two conditions is satisfied:\ni. du0 = 0 and there exists a global minimiser with an internal U-block or;\nii. dv0 = 0 and there exists a global minimiser with an internal V-block.\nThe non-uniqueness mentioned in condition 2a can manifest itself in multiple ways. Figure 2\nshows how the optimal structure varies with mass: as the mass increases, the global minimiser\nprogresses through structures with more and more layers. At the intersection points of the curves\nin the figure, indicated by a circle, structures belonging to different curves have the same value of\nthe energy. Another possibility occurs when du0 = dv0 , since then u and v can be interchanged\nwithout changing the energy. The situation where two minimisers are both connected, have the\nsame sequence of blocks (up to mirroring), but differ in the block widths, however, is ruled out by\nTheorem 3.3.\nThe fact that the global minimiser can be non-unique when, for example, du0 = 0 can easily\nbe recognised by an example. Suppose that there exists a global minimiser of the form UVUVU.\nSince the outer blocks of this structure are both U-blocks, Lemma 3.4 states that the value of \u03c6\nis the same at the two interfaces of U-0 type, and \u03c6 is therefore symmetric around the middle of\nthe structure.\nWe now split the structure at the middle into two parts, and move the two parts apart. In\ndoing so we create two new U-0 type transitions, which carry no energy penalty since we assumed\ndu0 = 0. Since we split at the middle, where \u03c6\u2032 = 0, the new potential \u03c6 can be constructed from\nthe old one by translation of the parts, and the value of ku \u2212 vkH \u22121 is also unchanged.\nProof of Theorem 3.7. We defer the proof of existence of a global constrained minimiser to the end,\nand start by showing that existence of a global minimiser implies existence of a global connected\nminimiser.\nSuppose (u, v) \u2208 K1 is a global minimiser such that R\\ supp(u + v) has at least three connected\ncomponents. By Corollary 3.6 the support of u + v is bounded, and therefore we can take those\nthree components to be (\u2212\u221e, 0), (x1 , x2 ), and (x3 , \u221e). The points 0, x1 , x2 , and x3 therefore all\nare interfaces.\nLet \u03c6 be the associated potential; since u and v vanish on (x1 , x2 ) and (x3 , \u221e), \u03c6 is linear on\n(x1 , x2 ) and constant on (x3 , \u221e). Denote by \u03c6\u203212 the value of \u03c6\u2032 (x) for x \u2208 [x1 , x2 ].\nFor any 0 < a \u2264 x2 \u2212 x1 , which we fix for the moment, we construct a new pair of functions \u016b\n\n11\n\n\fand v\u0304 with associated potential \u03c6\u0304 as follows.

As for the interfacial term in F1 , if 0 < a < x2 \u2212 x1 ,\nthen the various transitions remain the same, only translated to different positions; therefore the\ninterfacial term is unchanged. In the case a = x2 \u2212 x1 , in comparison with (u, v) the two interfaces\nat x = x1 and x = x2 have been joined to one interface, or have even annihilated each other; by\nthe assumption (9) this does not increase the interfacial term.\nFor the second term of F1 we calculate\nZ x3\nZ x1\nZ\n\u0001\n2\n\u20322\n\u2032 2\ne\n\u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6 +\n\u03c6 =\nx +a\n\u2212\u221e\nR\nZ x1 3\nZ x1\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c6\u2032 + a\u03c6\u2032 12\n(13)\n\u03c6\u2032 +\n\u2264\nx1 +a\nZ\u2212\u221e\n2\n\u03c6\u2032 .\n=\nR\n\nWe conclude that F1 (\u016b, v\u0304) \u2264 F1 (u, v). Since (u, v) is a global minimiser, we conclude that\nF1 (\u016b, v\u0304) = F1 (u, v) and thus that (\u016b, v\u0304) is another global minimiser. Furthermore by Corollary 3.6, supp(u + v) has a finite number of connected components and thus we can repeat this\nprocedure until only one component remains. Therefore we have proved that if a global minimiser\nexists, then there (also) exists a global minimiser with connected support.\nAssume now that two global minimisers exist, one of which has connected support. The other\nglobal minimiser, let us call it (u, v), either has connected supp(u + v) or disconnected supp(u + v).\nIn the former case we have proved part 2a of the theorem; therefore we now assume the latter\ncase, and show that this implies part 2b.\nSince (u, v) has disconnected supp(u + v), we can apply the construction above. For a given\nchoice of a, we find another configuration (\u016b, v\u0304) with energy equal or less than that of (u, v).\nSince (u, v) is a global minimiser, the energy of (\u016b, v\u0304) is equal to that of (u, v) and thus the two\ninequalities encountered above are saturated. In particular,\n\u2022 The joining of the two interfaces surrounding a 0-block does not reduce the energy;\n\u2022 The inequality (13) is saturated.\nThe saturation of (13) implies that \u03c6\u203212 = 0, and therefore that \u03c6(x1 ) = \u03c6(x2 ). We now prove\nthat these interfaces are of the same type, i.e. either both U-0 type or both V-0 type transitions.\nSuppose not, and to be concrete, suppose that the interface at x = x1 is a V-0 transition,\nand at x = x2 a 0-U transition. In this paragraph we will explicitly distinguish between mirrored\ninterfaces of the same type, e.g. U-0 and 0-U. Since \u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 = u \u2212 v and \u03c6\u2032 (x1 ) = \u03c6\u2032 (x2 ) = \u03c6\u203212 = 0,\nthere exists a y2 > 0 such that the next transition is at x2 +y2 and \u03c6 decreases for x \u2208 (x2 , x2 +y2 ),\n12\n\n\fimplying that the next transition can not be a U-0 transition (which would require the same value\nfor \u03c6 as at x = x2 ) but is a U-V transition, with a value of \u03c6 less than \u03c6(x2 ). The same argument\nholds for the interface at x1 : the previous transition is at x1 \u2212 y1 for a y1 > 0 and is again a U-V\ntransition, this time with a value of \u03c6 larger than \u03c6(x1 ) = \u03c6(x2 ). Since two U-V transitions have\na different value of \u03c6, the structure is not stationary, a contradiction.\nSince the interfaces at x1 and x2 are of the same type, a non-changing interface energy implies\nthat either du0 = 0 or dv0 = 0, which is the first part of conditions 2(b)i and 2(b)ii. Since the\nconstruction provides a global minimiser with an internal U-block (if du0 = 0) or an internal\nV-block (if dv0 = 0), the second part of these conditions is also satisfied.\nWe have now proved that existence of a disconnected global minimiser implies condition 2b.\nThe opposite statement, that condition 2b suffices for the existence of a disconnected global\nminimiser, follows from splitting any minimiser at a point x inside a U-block (supposing du0 = 0)\nsuch that \u03c6\u2032 (x) = 0.\nIt remains to prove the existence of a global minimiser, and we now turn to this issue. Let\n(un , vn ) be a minimising sequence. We first note that the translation arguments that we used above\nallow us to reduce an arbitrary minimising sequence to a minimising sequence whose elements each\nare connected. Therefore we may assume that the support of the sequence remains inside some\nlarge bounded set \u03a9 \u2282 R, and does not approach the boundary of this set.\nSince both un and vn are bounded in L\u221e (\u03a9), there exist subsequences (that we again denote\nby un and vn ) such that\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nin L\u221e (\u03a9).\nand\nvn \u2212\u21c0 v\u221e\nR\nR\nNote that this convergence implies that u\u221e = v\u221e = M , since the constant 1 is an element\nof L1 (\u03a9). Since L2 (\u03a9) \u2282 L1 (\u03a9) we also have\nun \u2212\u21c0 u\u221e\n\nun \u2212\u21c0 u\u221e\n\nand\n\nvn \u2212\u21c0 v\u221e\n\nin L2 (\u03a9).\n\nThe functions u\u221e , v\u221e , as the weak-* limits of un , vn , take values in the interval [0, 1]. Thus if we\nreplace K1 in (2.2), the definition of F1 , by (note the change in value set)\n\u001a\nZ \u001b\nZ\n2\nv ,\nu=\nK\u03031 := (u, v) \u2208 (BV(\u03a9)) : u(x), v(x) \u2208 [0, 1] a.e., and uv = 0 a.e., and\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nthen (u\u221e , v\u221e ) \u2208 K\u03031 and F1 is convex on L2 (\u03a9). This implies that the subdifferential of F1 at\n(u\u221e , v\u221e ) is non-empty, i.e. there exist p1 , p2 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) such that\nZ\nZ\nF1 (un , vn ) \u2265 F (u\u221e , v\u221e ) +\np1 (un \u2212 u\u221e ) +\np2 (vn \u2212 v\u221e ).\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nWeak convergence in L2 (\u03a9) now gives us lower semi-continuity with respect to this convergence:\nF1 (u\u221e , v\u221e ) \u2264 lim inf F1 (un , vn ).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIt remains to prove that u\u221e and v\u221e are admissible, i.e. that they take values 0 and 1 and that\nu\u221e v\u221e = 0 almost everywhere. In other words, we want to show that not only (u\u221e , v\u221e ) \u2208 K\u03031 ,\nbut even (u\u221e , v\u221e ) \u2208 K1 .\nBy the assumption duv > 0 at leastRone of the coefficients cu and cv is strictly positive. Suppose\nthat cu > 0; then the boundedness of |u\u2032n | implies that the convergence of un is strong in L1 and\npointwise almost everywhere [EG92, Theorem 5.2.4]. Therefore, for any \u03c8 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9),\nZ\nZ\n\u03c8un vn = 0,\n\u03c8u\u221e v\u221e = lim\n\u03a9\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03a9\n\nimplying that u\u221e v\u221e = 0. Also the pointwise convergence gives\nu\u221e \u2208 {0, 1} a.e.\n13\n\n\fIf also cv > 0, then the same convergence holds for v\u221e , and the proof is done. If instead c0 > 0,\nthen the same holds for u\u221e + v\u221e , and again the proof is done. We continue under the assumption\nthat c0 = cv = 0.\nFor the pair (u\u221e , v\u221e ) to be admissible, it is necessary that v\u221e takes values in the boundary\nset {0, 1} only. This is a consequence of the lemma that we state below.\nLemma 3.8. Let c0 = cv = 0. If (u, v) minimises F1 among all pairs (\u016b, v\u0304) such that\n\u2022 \u016b \u2208 BV (R; {0, 1}) and v\u0304 \u2208 BV (R; [0, 1]);\n\u2022 \u016bv\u0304 = 0 a.e. in R;\nR\nR\nR\n\u2022 R \u016b = R v\u0304 = R u,\n\nthen v(x) \u2208 {0, 1} for almost every x \u2208 R.\nProof. Choose 0 < \u03b7 < 1/2 and let \u03c9 \u2282 R be the set of intermediate values\n\u03c9 = {x \u2208 R : v(x) \u2208 (\u03b7, 1 \u2212 \u03b7)}.\nWe need to prove that |\u03c9| = 0. Assume that |\u03c9| > 0 and define a perturbation\n\u03b6(x) = (\u03c6(x) \u2212 c)\u03c7\u03c9 (x),\nwhere \u03c6 = \u03c6u\u2212v is the Poisson potential associated with\nR u \u2212 v, \u03c7\u03c9 is the characteristic function\nof the set \u03c9, and c is a constant chosen to ensure that \u03b6 = 0. Note that almost everywhere on \u03c9\nthe function \u03c6 is twice differentiable with \u03c6\u2032\u2032 \u2265 \u03b7 > 0.\nSince the pair (u, v + \u03b5\u03b6) is admissible for \u03b5 in a neighbourhood of zero,\nZ\nZ\n\u2202\nF1 (u, v + \u03b5\u03b6)\n= 2 \u03b6\u03c6 = 2 (\u03c6 \u2212 c)2 ,\n0=\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u03c9\nR\n\u03b5=0\nso that \u03c6 is constant a.e. on \u03c9. As \u03c6 is defined up to addition of constants we may choose \u03c6 = 0\non \u03c9.\nSince |\u03c9| > 0, we can choose x0 \u2208 \u03c9 such that \u03c9 has density 1 at x0 and that \u03c6 is twice\ndifferentiable at x0 , with \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (x0 ) \u2208 (\u03b7, 1 \u2212 \u03b7). Because of the density condition it is possible to find\nsequences an \u2208 R, n \u2208 N, with the properties\n\u2022 an \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e;\n\u2022 For each n \u2208 N, x0 \u00b1 an \u2208 \u03c9.\nThen\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (x0 ) = lim |an |\u22122 \u03c6(x0 \u2212 an ) \u2212 2\u03c6(x0 ) + \u03c6(x0 + an ) = 0,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\na contradiction with \u03c6 (x0 ) \u2265 \u03b7, and therefore with the assumption that \u03c9 has positive measure.\n\n3.4\n\nExcursion: global minimisers on TL\n\nBy very similar arguments one may prove the corresponding statement for functions on the\ntorus TL , thus extending the characterisation of [CR05] to all global minimisers.\nTheorem 3.9. Let L > 0, duv > 0, and fix a mass M > 0, with M < L/2.\n1. There exists a global minimiser (u, v) of F1 on the torus TL under constrained mass M for\nwhich supp(u + v) is connected.\n2. This global minimiser is non-unique (apart from translation and mirroring) if and only if\n14\n\n\f(a) the energy of this configuration is equal to the energy of another configuration (\u016b, v\u0304) for\nwhich supp(\u016b + v\u0304) is connected, or\n(b) one of the following two conditions is satisfied:\ni. du0 = 0 and there exists a global minimiser with an internal U-block or;\nii. dv0 = 0 and there exists a global minimiser with an internal V-block.\nProof. The proof follows the same lines as in the case of R, Theorem 3.7. We will point out the\ndifferences between the two cases.\nSuppose (u, v) \u2208 K1 is a global minimiser such that TL \\ supp(u + v) has at least two connected\ncomponents, which, by translating u and v, we can assume to be (x1 , x2 ) \u2282 [0, L) and (x3 , L) with\nx3 > x2 . Let \u03c6 be the associated potential; since u and v vanish on (x1 , x2 ) and (x3 , L), \u03c6 is\nlinear on these two intervals. Let \u03c6\u2032 (x) = \u03c6\u203212 for x \u2208 [x1 , x2 ] and \u03c6\u2032 (x) = \u03c6\u20323L for x \u2208 [x3 , L]. By\npossibly exchanging roles we can assume that |\u03c6\u203212 | \u2265 |\u03c6\u20323L |.\nConstructing for some 0 < a < x2 \u2212 x1 the same translated functions \u016b, v\u0304, and \u03c6e as given in\n(10\u201312), we have the analogous inequality\nZ\n\n0\n\nL\n\n\u03c6e\u20322 =\n\n\u2264\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nx1\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u2032 +\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nx1\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u2032 +\n\nx3\n\n2\n\nx +a\nZ x1 3\n\nx1 +a\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032 3L (L \u2212 x3 + a)\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u2032 + a\u03c6\u2032 12 + \u03c6\u2032 3L (L \u2212 x3 )\n\n(14)\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u2032 .\n\n0\n\nAlthough \u03c6e satisfies \u03c6e\u2032\u2032 = \u016b\u2212v\u0304 on (0, L), the function \u03c6e can in general not be extended periodically,\ne 6= \u03c6(L).\ne\ni.e. \u03c6(0)\nTo correct this we define\ne\n\u03c6\u0304(x) := \u03c6(x)\n\u2212\n\nx e\ne\n(\u03c6(L) \u2212 \u03c6(0)),\nL\n\nso that the function \u03c6\u0304 solves \u03c6e\u2032\u2032 = \u016b \u2212 v\u0304 on (0, L), is continuously differentiable on (0, L), and\nsatisfies \u03c6\u0304(0) = \u03c6\u0304(L).

The reasoning proceeds in two steps.\nStep 1: Take a < x2 \u2212 x1 . When a < x2 \u2212 x1 no interfaces are created, annihilated or\nchanged, and we only need to consider the inequalities in (14) and (15). Since these are saturated,\nthe following conditions hold:\n15\n\n\f1. |\u03c6\u203212 | = |\u03c6\u20323L |, and\ne\ne\n2. \u03c6(L)\n= \u03c6(0).\n\nWe first calculate\n\ne\ne = \u03c6(x3 ) \u2212 \u03c6(x1 + a) + \u03c6(x1 ) + \u03c6\u2032 (L \u2212 x3 + a) \u2212 \u03c6(0)\n\u03c6(L)\n\u2212 \u03c6(0)\n3L\n= \u2212\u03c6(x1 + a) + \u03c6(x1 ) + a\u03c6\u20323L\n= a(\u03c6\u20323L \u2212 \u03c6\u203212 ).\n\nBy condition 2 above we have \u03c6\u203212 = \u03c6\u20323L , which is also compatible with condition 1.\nWe now claim that \u03c6\u203212 = \u03c6\u20323L = 0. Suppose not, say (for concreteness) \u03c6\u203212 = \u03c6\u20323L > 0, then\n\u03c6(x1 ) < \u03c6(x2 ) and \u03c6(x3 ) < \u03c6(L). Since for a stationary point the potential \u03c6 has the same value\nat all U-0 type transitions and the same value for all V-0 type transitions, the two transitions\nat x1 and at x2 are of different type, thus one is a U-0 type transition and the other a V-0 type\ntransition. The same is true for x3 and L (or 0); and the transitions at x1 and x3 are the same.\nTherefore \u03c6(x1 ) = \u03c6(x3 ).\nFor any fixed a in the interval (0, x2 \u2212 x1 ), however, we have now constructed a second global\nminimiser (\u016b, v\u0304)-and therefore a second stationary point-for which \u03c6(x1 ) 6= \u03c6(x3 \u2212 a), since\ne 1 ) = \u03c6(x1 ) and\n\u03c6\u0304(x1 ) = \u03c6(x\ne 3 \u2212 a) = \u03c6(x3 ) \u2212 \u03c6(x1 + a) + \u03c6(x1 )\n\u03c6\u0304(x3 \u2212 a) = \u03c6(x\n= \u03c6(x1 ) \u2212 a\u03c6\u203212\n< \u03c6(x1 ).\n\nSince the interfaces of (\u016b, v\u0304) at x1 and x3 \u2212a are of the same type, this contradicts the stationarity of\nthis second minimiser, and we conclude that \u03c6\u203212 = \u03c6\u20323L = 0. Note that since the intervals (x1 , x2 )\nand (x3 , L) were chosen as arbitrary connected components of TL \\ supp(u + v), this implies that\n\u03c6\u2032 vanishes on the whole of TL \\ supp(u + v).\nStep 2: Take a = x2 \u2212 x1 . Non-uniqueness in this case implies that also the interfacial\nenergy remains the same in the construction of (\u016b, v\u0304). As in the case of R, the interfaces at x1\nand x2 that are joined together in the construction of (\u016b, v\u0304) are of the same type, i.e. either both\nU-0 type or both V-0 type transitions. The fact that \u03c6 is constant on 0-blocks is used in this\nargument. We conclude that either du0 = 0 or dv0 = 0, and that a connected global minimiser\nexists with at least one internal U-block (if du0 = 0) or at least one internal V-block (if dv0 = 0).\nThis proves the necessity of condition 2b.\nThe sufficiency of condition 2b follows by splitting one of the internal blocks, as in the case\nof R. Apart from the simplifying fact that the torus is bounded, the proof of existence of a global\nminimiser is identical to the case of R.\nRemark 3.10. Note that the proof of existence of a global minimiser generalises straightforwardly to the higher dimensional case of the torus TN\nL , because the torus is bounded. On the\nunbounded domain RN , N \u2265 2, the above proof does not suffice.\n\n3.5\n\nExplicit values and a lower bound\n\nWe now focus again on functions on R. The results of the previous sections\nallow us to calculate\nR\nglobal minima of the energy F1 (u, v) as a function of the mass M = u. Two important special\ncases are the monolayer and the bilayer.\nA monolayer consists of a single U- and a single V-block, of equal width m, where m is the\nmass of u or v, i.e. positioning the block around the origin for convenience,\nu(x) = \u03c7(\u2212m,0)\n\nand v(x) = \u03c7(0,m) ,\n\n16\n\n\fwhere \u03c7A is the characteristic function of the set A. We then find for the derivative of the Poisson\npotential\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nfor x < \u2212m\n\uf8f20\n\u2032\n\u03c6 (x) = |x| \u2212 m for \u2212m < x < m\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\nfor x > m,\nThe total energy then becomes\n\n2\nF1 = 2(c0 + cu + cv ) + m3 .\n3\nR\nR\nNote the definition of mass: a monolayer\nof mass M means that u = v = M , and therefore that\nR\nthe 'total' mass of the monolayer (u + v) equals 2M . In this case the mass M of the monolayer\nequals the width m of each of the blocks.\nA bilayer consists of two monolayers joined back-to-back. It comes in two varieties, as UVU\nand as VUV. For a UVU bilayer of mass M = 2m, given by\nmonolayer of mass M = m:\n\nu(x) = \u03c7(\u22122m,\u2212m)\u222a(m,2m)\nthe derivative of the Poisson potential is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u22122m \u2212 x\n\u2032\n\u03c6 (x) = x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f42m \u2212 x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\n\nand v(x) = \u03c7(\u2212m,m) ,\n\nfor\nfor\nfor\nfor\nfor\n\nx < \u22122m\n\u22122m < x < \u2212m\n\u2212m < x < m\nm < x < 2m\nx > 2m.\n\nThe energy has the value\n\n4\nF1 = 2c0 + 4cu + 2cv + m3 ,\n3\nFor a VUV bilayer the situation is of course analogous:\nUVU bilayer of mass M = 2m :\n\n4\nF1 = 2c0 + 2cu + 4cv + m3 .\n3\nSimilarly, n-layered structures consisting of n monolayers back-to-back, have energy\nVUV bilayer of mass M = 2m :\n\nVUVU. . .

V n-monolayer or UVUV. . . U n-monolayer the value of n is even, while\nfor a VUVU. . . U n-monolayer it is odd. Furthermore m is the U-mass in one monolayer, thus m\nis the width of the outer blocks, from which we see that the width of the inner blocks is 2m. By\ncollecting these results we find:\n= 2dv0 + nduv +\n\nTheorem 3.11. Let N = 1.

If duv = 0, then the first statement is easily checked and the second follows from the\nexample of Section 2.2. We continue under the assumption that duv > 0.\nLet (u, v) be a global minimiser with connected supp(u + v), which exists according to Theorem 3.7. Note that for all three cases of structures (VUVU. . . V, UVUV. . . V, and UVUV. . . U)\nthe interfacial terms are bounded from below by 2(c0 + min(cu , cv )), so that\nF1 \u2265 2(c0 + min(cu , cv )) + nduv +\n\n2\nM 3.\n3n2\n\nMinimising this with respect to n gives the desired lower bound.

In the limit M \u2192 \u221e the quotient n(M )/M therefore\nconverges to (4/3 duv )1/3 ; with this convergence the inequality (22) implies (21).\nIn Figure 3 the graphs depicting the energy per mass for VUVU. . . V configurations consisting\nof different numbers of monolayers are shown, for some specific parameter values. The lower bound\nfrom Theorem 3.11 is indicated as well.\nRemark 3.12. Minimising F1 /M from (16\u201319) with respect to m, we find as minimising value\nfor m,\n3(k1 du0 + k2 dv0 + nduv )\n,\nm30 (n) :=\n4n\nwhere, depending on the configuration k1 = 0, k2 = 2 (17), k1 = k2 = 1 (18) or k1 = 2, k2 = 0\n(19). In all three cases we find that in the limit n \u2192 \u221e, or equivalently (for m fixed) M \u2192 \u221e,\nthe width of the inner blocks converges to\n2 lim m0 (n) = 61/3 d1/3\nuv .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nNote that in [M\u00fcl93] and [RW03a] it is found that one-dimensional minimisers for the functionals\nunder consideration in those papers are periodic with period \u223c (surface tension)1/3 . (In these\ndiffuse interface functionals the surface tension coefficients are given by integrating the square\nroot of the potential.)\n\n4\n\nHigher dimensions\n\nIn this section we derive bounds on energy of minimisers in terms of the mass M . The first result,\nTheorem 4.1, shows that the minimal energy has a lower bound that scales linearly in mass in the\nlimit M \u2192 \u221e. This is an extension of the lower bound (20) in one dimension, but with a smaller\nconstant.\nA simple argument immediately gives an upper bound on the minimal energy at given mass:\nfixing any structure of unit mass, a candidate structure at mass M \u2208 N can be obtained by\n18\n\n\fF1\nM\n\n5\n4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n3\n2\n1.17\n1\nLB\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nM\n\nFigure 3: Energy per unit mass for the one-dimensional case, according to the calculations in\nSection 3.5. M is the total U-mass; for the parameters the values du0 = 1, duv = 0.6 and dv0 = 0.4\nare chosen. All the graphs belong to a VUVU. . . V n-monolayer structure, where n/2 increases\nfrom 1 (left) to 20 (right) with step size 1. Also drawn are the (dashed) lower bound LB (20), and\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\nthe asymptote 2\u2212 3 3 3 duv\n\u2248 1.17446.\n\ndistributing M copies of the unit-mass structure over RN . The energy of the resulting structure\nequals M times the energy of the unit-mass structure. This construction can be extended to\nnon-integer mass M by spatially stretching a structure of integer mass close to M . In the limit\nM \u2192 \u221e the resulting perturbation of the energy is small.\nIn Sections 4.2 and 4.3 we therefore provide tighter upper bounds, by constructing N -dimensional\nstructures out of near-optimal k-dimensional ones, with k < N .\n\n4.1\n\nLower bound\n\nFor this section we pick a function \u03ba \u2208 Cc\u221e (RN ), non-negative and radially symmetric, such that\nZ\n\u03ba = 1.\nRN\n\nFor \u03b5 > 0 we now define\n\u03ba\u03b5 (x) :=\nNote that\n\nR\n\nRN\n\n1\n\u03ba(x/\u03b5).\n\u03b5N\n\n\u03ba\u03b5 = 1 for all \u03b5. In the following we will use the constant AN , defined as\nZ\n|e * w| dHN \u22121 (w),\nAN := \u2212\nS N \u22121\n\nwhere S N \u22121 is the (N \u2212 1)-dimensional unit sphere and e is any element of S N \u22121 . This definition\nis independent of the choice of e, because the integration is over all of S N \u22121 .\nThe central result is an interpolation inequality between the BV -seminorm and H \u22121 . In spirit,\nand in its application, it is similar to the Lemma 2.1 of [Cho01]. The proof is different, however,\nand uses an argument of [KO02], in combination with the characterisation of BV by [D\u00e1v02].\n\n19\n\n\fTheorem 4.1. Let duv 6= 0.

Theorem 4.3 formalises the intuitive\nidea that extending a one-dimensional minimiser in the other directions, and then cutting off the\nresulting planar structure at some large distance, should result in an N - dimensional structure\nwhose energy-to-mass ratio is close to that of the original one-dimensional structure. We formulate\nthe result for k-dimensional structures that are embedded in N dimensions.\nLet 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N \u2212 1, and let us write K1,k for the admissible set K1 on Rk .

Since the integral of u \u2212 v vanishes the\npotential \u03c6 := G\u2217 (u \u2212 v) decays to zero at least as fast as |\u03be|1\u2212k , as can be seen from the multipole\nR 2\nexpansion of \u03c6\u0304 (see [HKDS93]). For dimensions k \u2265 3 it follows that \u03c6 is finite; but for k = 1, 2\na higher decay rate is necessary, which we provide by requiring an additional vanishing moment.\nThe case k = 1 is special: the vanishing of the zero and first moments implies that \u03c6 := G \u2217 (u \u2212 v)\nis zero in a neighbourhood of infinity.\nProof of Theorem 4.4.

We now use this tool to investigate\nthe energy values of various fixed-geometry structures.\n\u00011/3 2/3\n\u2022 A one-dimensional, lamellar, structure.

(Although such a choice is ruled out by (9), one may calculate the value of the\nenergy in this case nonetheless.) In this case the limit value is approached from above.\nAlternatively, if either du0 or dv0 is non-zero, then the limit value is larger than that of the\noptimal lamellar structures.\nAmong this list, therefore, the structures with lowest energy per unit mass are the lamellar\nstructures. It seems natural to conjecture that global minimisers also resemble cut-off lamellar\nstructures, and have comparable energy per unit mass. On the other hand, the results of the\ncompanion paper [GP07] show that bilayer structures are unstable in a part of parameter space,\nand similarly Ren and Wei showed that for the pure diblock copolymer model (u+v \u2261 1) 'wriggled\nlamellar' solutions may have lower energy than straight ones [RW05]. Determining the morphology\nof large-mass global minimisers is therefore very much an open question.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nThe results discussed in this paper provide an initial view on the properties of the energy (1), and\nconsequently on mixtures of block copolymers with homopolymers. The sharp-limit version of the\nmore classical smooth-interface energy provides a useful simplification and provides us with tools\nthat would otherwise be unavailable.\nIn one dimension we continued on the work of Choksi and Ren and gave a complete characterisation of the structure of one-dimensional minimisers, both on R and on a periodic cell.\nIn the multi-dimensional case we have proved upper and lower bounds for the energy of minimisers. These bounds both scale linearly with mass, but have different constants. The upper\nbound is derived from the one-dimensional minimisers, thanks to the cut-off estimate of Theorem 4.3; the results of the companion paper on the stability of mono- and bilayers [GP07] suggest\nthat for some parameter values this upper bound can be exact, while for others it is not. Similarly,\nthe lower bound proved in Section 4.1 has the right scaling in terms of mass, but the constant is\nnot sharp.\nThe sharpness of the estimates is especially relevant in relation to the issue of optimal morphology. A precise estimate of the energy level of energy minimisers may exclude large classes of\nmorphologies and thus limit the possible morphology of energy minimisers.\nSince we lack such a sharp estimate the question of the preferred morphology in multiple\ndimensions is still completely open. Part of this question is the behaviour of the morphology near\nthe copolymer-homopolymer interface. For instance, if the preferred morphology is lamellar, does\nthe lamellar orientation show a preference to be orthogonal, parallel, or otherwise aligned with\nrespect to the interface? The experimental observations of for instance [KHH94, ON97, ZJM05]\n25\n\n\fshow both orthogonal and parallel alignments. Other issues are those of the penalty incurred\nby certain macrodomain morphologies and defects (such as chevron or loop morphologies [AM04,\nFigures 11 and 14]).\nThe large-mass limit for the functional F1 is equivalent to a singular-limit process at fixed\nmass for the functional F\u03b5 (6). As discussed in Section 1.5 the results of [PR06] suggest that for\ncertain values of the ci -to be precise, for those values for which bilayer structures are stable-the\nfunctional F\u03b5 may display similar, partially localised behaviour.\nThe results from this paper have some interesting physical implications. Theorem 4.3 tells\nus that extended one-dimensional minimisers, i.e. layered structures, will have a relatively low\nenergy (although the question whether or not these are minimisers is still open). Theorem 3.3\nand Remark 3.12 show that these layers all have the same width. One can think of lamellar\nconfigurations like this as having all polymer molecules aligned in straight rows next to each other.\nStructures like 0U0, which are not to be expected on physical grounds, are a priori not forbidden\nin our model, but such configurations are not stationary points, as is shown in Section 3.3.\nDepending on the surface tension coefficients very different structures can appear. As remarked\nin Section 2.2 the role of duv is a special one. If duv = 0, there is no repulsion between the Uand V-phases, but there is attraction, due to the H \u22121 -norm. Complete mixing of both phases\nwill occur. If one of the other surface tension coefficients is zero instead, say du0 = 0, then UVU\nbilayers can be joined together without extra cost, and vice versa UVUVU structures can be split\nthrough the middle without increasing the energy. Physically this happens if the U- and 0-phases\ndo not repel each other. The simplest case one can think of is if both phases consist of the same\nmaterial. If both du0 > 0 and dv0 > 0, it will always be energetically favourable to join different\nlayers together, because doing so decreases the length of the energetically costly interfaces.\n\nA\n\nSpherically symmetric configurations\n\nIn this appendix we will compute the energy F1 of spherically symmetric monolayers and bilayers.\nIn [ON98] the energy for a spherically symmetric bilayer in two and three dimensions is computed.\nWe will give the energy in any dimension N .\n\nR2\n\nR1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nV\n\nU\n\nR0 PSfrag replacements\nU V U\n\nR2\n\nR0\n\nR1\n\nR3\n(b) A spherically symmetric bilayer in two\ndimensions\n\n(a) A spherically symmetric monolayer in\ntwo dimensions\n\nFigure 4:\nA spherically symmetric monolayer with inner U-band in N dimensions consists of a spherical\nlayer of U between radial distances R0 and R1 and a spherical layer of V between radial distances\nR1 and R2 . An example for N = 2 is drawn in Figure 4a. Similarly, a spherically symmetric UVU\nbilayer is a spherical layer of V between radial distances R1 and R2 , flanked by two spherical\nlayers of U, between radial distances R0 and R1 , and R2 and R3 respectively. A two-dimensional\n\n26\n\n\fexample is shown in Figure 4b. Monolayers with inner V-band or VUV bilayers are constructed\nby interchanging U and V.\nWe will first compute the energy for monolayers. In Theorem A.1 we give the expansion in\nterms of the curvature \u03ba of the energy per mass, for small \u03ba. The exact expressions for F1 can be\nfound in the proof of the theorem, in (35) for N = 2 and in (36) for N \u2265 3.\nThe expansion in terms of small curvature is obtained by linearising these exact energy expressions around \"R = \u221e\". To this end we introduce for the monolayer the curvature \u03ba, total U-mass\nM , and mass per (hyper-)surface area m:\n\u03ba := R1\u22121 ,\nm :=\n\nM := \u03c9N (R1N \u2212 R0N ),\n\nM \u03baN \u22121\nM\n=\n.\nN \u22121\nN \u03c9N\nN \u03c9N R1\n\nWe then get\nR0 = \u03ba\u22121\nR2 = \u03ba\u22121\n\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 N m\u03ba,\n\u221a\nN\n1 + N m\u03ba.\n\nN\n\nTheorem A.1.

The theorem above states the case where the U-phase is on the\ninside. The other case is found by interchanging du0 and dv0 .\nProof of Theorem A.1. The proof consists of three steps. First we compute F1 in terms of the radii\nRi , then we rewrite it as a function of \u03ba, M and m. Finally the expansion is found by computing\nthe first terms of the Taylor series of these expressions for \u03ba \u226a 1.\nThe interfacial terms are computed in a straightforward manner. For the H \u22121 -norm we need\nto compute the Poisson potential, which depends only on the radius r because of the spherical\nsymmetry and which we will denote by \u03c6(r).
