Even though only a small fraction of observed bursts exhibit\nsuch pulses, these are of interest to study as they reflect individual emission\nepisodes during the burst. We have previously found that for about half of these\ndecays, the instantaneous photon flux is consistent with a power law in time,\nwhere the photon flux \u221d 1/time. This decay behavior is a consequence of the\nvalidity of both a power law correlation between the hardness and the intensity\nand an exponential correlation between the hardness and the time-integrated\nintensity, the fluence. Here, we study a complete sample of 25 pulses (having a\npeak flux in 1 s time resolution of more than 5 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 and a S/N\nof 30 in at least 8 time bins) and, specifically, search for other types of decay\nbehaviors. First, we find that a power law gives a better description of the\npulse decays than a stretched exponential, the most commonly assumed pulse\nshape so far. Then we find that about half of the decays behave approximately\nas 1/time, and the other half approximately as 1/(time)3 . For a few of the\n1/(time)3 decays, the two correlations, the hardness-intensity correlation and\nthe hardness-fluence correlation, are constrained and found to be consistent\nwith the light curve decay behavior.

The mechanism of the conversion\nof the kinetic energy, connected to the outflow, into the observed radiation is not clear.\nShocks within the outflow or shocks imposed by the external medium tap the kinetic energy\nwhich is transferred to \u03b3-rays through a single or a combination of radiation processes.\nSignatures of the gamma-ray epoch of the burst are hidden in the time evolution of the\nintensity (the light curve) and in its spectral behavior. This is especially true for individual\nemission episodes, pulses, that complex light curves are believed to consist of. Only a small\nfraction of all bursts exhibit long and smooth pulses that are useful for such investigations.\nNevertheless, these have given a number of relations between different observables, which\nmight lead to a deeper understanding of the creation of the \u03b3-rays, by giving clues to and\nconstraining physical models.\nMuch effort has been devoted to the study of such relations separately, in their own\nright, while other works study purely the morphology of the light curve (see, for instance,\nthe review by Ryde 1999). However, the spectral and temporal behaviors are intimately\nconnected and should in a proper treatment be studied together. A first such step was\nmade in Ryde & Svensson (2000; hereafter RS00) who gave a self-consistent description,\ndescribing the complete spectral-temporal behavior of the decay phase of a pulse structure\nin the light curve. RS00 described, in detail, the most common behavior found in \u223c 45%\nof long bright GRB pulses. It is of specific interest to study the decay phase of a pulse\nstructure, as it most probably describes a certain radiative regime of the emission; for\ninstance, it could contain information on the actual cooling of the emitting region. In the\npresent paper, we explore the approach outlined in RS00 and search for other types of\nspectral/temporal behaviors, guided by the variety of behaviors of the light curve.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the following notation. Epk is the peak energy of\nthe spectrum, defined as the photon energy where the power output is the largest, i.e.,\nthe maximum of the E 2 NE spectrum, where E is the photon energy in keV and NE is the\nspecific photon flux (photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 ). N(t) is the photon flux at time t (photons\nR\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 ), and finally, \u03a6(t) is the photon fluence in cm\u22122 , defined by \u03a6(t) = t N(t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 .\n\nFor the spectral and temporal evolution there are the following three main observables\nto study, Epk (t), N(t), and the derived quantity, \u03a6(t), neglecting a possible evolution of\nthe instantaneous shape of the spectrum. The relations between these three observables are\ngiven by two correlations, chosen here as Epk (N) and Epk (\u03a6). The most common types\nof these two correlations are Epk (N) being a power law function of N, and Epk (\u03a6) being\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nan exponential function of \u03a6. One of the most important issues emphasized in RS00 is\nthat there is an inevitable spectral/temporal connection, something that is not usually\nconsidered. For instance, RS00 showed that by combining these two empirical correlations,\nEpk (N) and Epk (\u03a6), one obtains a specific power law decay behavior of N(t) and Epk (t),\nwhere the N(t)-decay \u221d t\u2212n has a power law index n = 1.\nKnowing two of the four behaviors, N(t), Epk (t), Epk (N), Epk (\u03a6), gives the other\ntwo. The question is which two of the four are the most fundamental ones. The way the\nresearch field has developed is that the two empirical correlations were established first. It\nhas, on the other hand, not been obvious with which functional shape to fit the pulse light\ncurve, N(t). The most commonly assumed pulse shape is that of a stretched exponential,\nbut there has been no motivation for this other than that it is a flexible pulse shape when\nmaking fits over the entire pulse. Essentially no work has been done on fitting Epk (t). With\nthis history, we focus on the three previously studied behaviors, N(t), Epk (N), Epk (\u03a6).\nSince the light curve is much better suited for statistical analysis, since the noise\n(Poisson statistics) is relatively small (as compared to the two correlations), we study what\ndifferent shapes, N(t), of the light curve lead to, assuming that one of the two empirical\nrelations, Epk (N) or Epk (\u03a6), is valid. The search is rigidly guided by the actual GRB\nobservations, which is complemented by an analytical treatment. Some of the results have\nbeen presented in a preliminary form in Ryde & Svensson (2001).\nIn \u00a7 2, we discuss the shape of individual pulses in the GRB light curve, comment on\nthe two common correlations, a power law Epk (N) and an exponential Epk (\u03a6), describing\nthe spectral evolution over time of such pulses, and, finally, what results for N(t) and\nEpk (t) the combination of these two correlations give rise to. The observations, made\nwith the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma-Ray\nObservatory (CGRO), and how the complete pulse sample was selected from the 9 years of\noperation are discussed in \u00a7 3. In \u00a7 4, we analyze the 25 light curve decays, and conclude\nthat they are better described by a power law decay rather than by a stretched exponential.\nThe decay index, n, turns out to have a bimodal distribution, with approximately half the\npulses having n \u223c 1 and the other half having n \u223c 3 but with a wide spread. This leads us\nin \u00a7 5 to generalize the analytical treatment in RS00, to cases with n 6= 1. These results are\nthen used in \u00a7 6, to fit the data for three different cases. These are:\ni) the two correlations are given by a power law Epk (N) and an exponential Epk (\u03a6),\nconsequently the power law pulse decay has the index n = 1;\nii) the pulse decay, N(t), is fitted as a power law of index n, the exponential Epk (\u03a6) is\nassumed to be valid, and a fit is made to the generalized Epk (N) of \u00a7 5; and finally\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\niii) the pulse decay, N(t), is fitted as a power law of index n, the power law Epk (N) is\nassumed to be valid, and a fit is made to the generalized Epk (\u03a6) of \u00a7 5.\nWe study, in particular, the 11 cases with n \u223c 3, and find that about half preferably belongs\nto case ii) and the other half to case iii). Furthermore, we re-analyze these 11 pulse decays\nby relaxing n to be free in the fitting of the generalized correlations. Only four pulses are\nthen sufficiently constrained and they are all consistent with a power law Epk (N) and that\nEpk (\u03a6) is given by the generalized function of \u00a7 5. In \u00a7 7, we elude on a few points in our\nanalysis and discuss our results in a physical context. We finish off by summarizing our\nresults in \u00a7 8.\n2.\n\nTemporal and Spectral Behavior of a GRB\n2.1.\n\nShape of the Light Curve\n\nA remarkable feature of the observed properties of GRBs is the large diversity of the\nlight curves, both morphologically and in strength and duration. Different approaches to\nunderstanding the light curve morphology have been pursued. It is generally believed that\nthe fundamental constituent of a GRB light curve is a time structure, a pulse, having a\nsharp rise and a slower decay phase, with the decay rate decreasing smoothly (e.g., Fishman\net al. 1994; Norris et al. 1996; Stern & Svensson 1996). This shape is denoted by the\nacronym FRED, fast-rise and exponential-decay, even though the decay is not necessarily\nexponential. A burst can consist of only a few such pulses, clearly separable, producing a\nsimple and smooth light curve. In the same manner, complex light curves are superpositions\nof many such fundamental pulses. Mixtures of the two types are also common. Such\ninterpretations have been shown to be able to explain and partly reproduce many observed\nlight curve morphologies. To reveal the underlying process of GRBs, the fundamental\npulses are of special interest as they probably show the clearest signature of the underlying\nphysics.\nTo model the morphological shape of a whole pulse, i.e., its location in time, the\namplitude, the width, the rise phase, the transition phase, and the decay phase, a\n\"stretched\" exponential is often used:\n\u03bd\n\nN(t) = N0 e\u2212(|t\u2212tmax |/\u03c4r,d ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere tmax is the time of the maximum photon number flux, N0 , of the pulse, \u03c4r,d are the\ntime constants for the rise and the decay phases, respectively, and \u03bd is the peakedness\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nparameter3 . Such a function gives a flexibility which makes it possible to describe the\nwhole shape of most pulses, and to quantify the characteristics of the pulses for a statistical\nanalysis. Norris et al. (1996) studied a sample of bursts observed by the BATSE Large\nArea Detectors (LADs) and stored in four energy channels4 . They modeled the light curves\nin detector counts in the four channels separately and found that the decay generally lies\nbetween a pure exponential (\u03bd = 1) and a Gaussian (\u03bd = 2). Lee et al. (1998) studied\napproximately 2500 pulse structures, in individual energy channels, using the high time\nresolution BATSE TTS data type, modeling them with the stretched exponential function\nof equation (1). They confirmed the general behavior that pulses tend to have shorter rise\ntimes than decay times. Norris et al. (1996) also used equation (1) to create an algorithm\nto separate overlapping pulses based on \u03c72 fitting. Scargle (1998) introduced an algorithm\nbased on Bayesian principles to estimate the characteristics of a pulse (location in time,\namplitude, width, and rise and decay times). This method has the advantage that it is\nindependent of any explicit pulse shape model and exploits the full time resolution of the\ndata.\nIn general, the rise and decay phases of a radiation pulse give us different aspects of\nthe emitting region. In the case of a region becoming active, the rise phase describes the\nsize of the region while the decay phase is determined by the cooling of it. To understand\nthe radiation process involved in the cooling, it is of interest to concentrate the study to\nthe decay phase. Schaefer & Dyson (1996) studied the decay phase of 10 smooth FRED\npulses in the four BATSE energy channels separately and found that most of them are\nnot exponentials, although a few cases come close. A power-law fit passes most of their\nstatistical tests. Indeed, in the description of RS00, on which we base the present work, the\ndecay phase of a pulse is described with N(t) = N0 /(1 + t/\u03c4 ), where t = 0 is the start of\nthe decay phase where N(t) = N0 . This will be discussed, in detail, in \u00a72.3. However, for\nsuch a behavior the fluence is divergent\n\u03a6(t) = N0 \u03c4 ln(1 + t/\u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n\nand therefore the decay of the intensity must eventually change into a more rapid one, or\npossibly be turned off completely.\nIt is thus an important issue to understand the actual duration of individual pulses, for\ninstance, for the interpretation of GRB light curves as being a superposition of individual\npulses. Giblin et al. (1999) report on GRB 980923 (BATSE trigger 7113) as having an\n3\n\nFor \u03bd > 1, equation (1) is, strictly speaking, a compressed exponential.\n\n4\n\nSee Fishman et al. (1989), for a description of the different data types of the BATSE data.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\napparent transition from a prompt, relatively short and variable phase to a longer and\nsmoother decay. They interpret this as the onset of the afterglow emission seen subsequently\nat other wavelengths. Furthermore, Stern (1999) showed a few examples of GRB pulses\nwith near-exponential tails that are traceable over almost 4 orders of magnitude in intensity.\nStern (1999) argues that nonlinear properties of an optically thick pair plasma could\nproduce this. When the emitting system is turned off, the large pair optical depth can\ndisappear quickly as the plasma annihilates on the short time scale of a few light crossing\ntimes. There are several examples of light curves which can be interpreted as having a\nsudden change, going into a more rapid decay (see, e.g., the left-hand panels in Figure 8\nbelow for triggers 829 and 6630).\n\n2.2.\n\nCorrelations of the Spectral Evolution\n\nThe first important relation between the observables, Epk , N, and \u03a6, is the correlation\nbetween the instantaneous, integrated intensity, N, and the hardness of the spectrum,\nEpk , the Hardness-Intensity Correlation (HIC). A common behavior is a tracking between\nthe intensity and the hardness, first noted by Golenetskii et al. (1983), who described it\nquantitatively as a power-law relation between the instantaneous luminosity (\u221d the energy\nflux) and the peak energy\nL \u221d (kT )\u03b3 ,\n(3)\n\nwhere the peak of the spectrum was quantified as the temperature in the thermal\nbremsstrahlung model (k is the Boltzmann's constant). The power-law index (the\ncorrelation index), \u03b3, was found to have typical values of 1.5 \u2212 1.7. Kargatis et al. (1994),\nconfirmed the existence of such a HIC. Special interest has been focused on the HIC\nbehavior over the decay phase of individual pulses in the GRB light curve. Kargatis et al.\n(1995) found a power law HIC in 28 pulse decays in 15 out of 26 GRBs with prominent\npulses. Furthermore, in their study of the decay phase of GRB pulses, RS00 gave an\nalternative description of the HIC:\nEpk (N) = Epk,0 (N/N0 )\u03b4 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the correlation index. Finally, Borgonovo & Ryde (2001) studied a sample of 82\nGRB pulse decays and found them to be consistent with a power law HIC in, at least, 57%\nof the cases and for these found \u03b3 = 1.9 \u00b1 0.75. They also found that the power law indices\nfrom pulses within a burst are more alike as compared to the distribution of indices from\npulses in different bursts.\nThe second empirical relation, the Hardness-Fluence Correlation (HFC), defines how\nthe instantaneous spectrum evolves as a function of photon fluence. Liang & Kargatis\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(1996) found an HFC for individual pulses in which the power peak energy, Epk , of the\ntime-resolved spectra decays exponentially as a function of the photon fluence \u03a6, i.e.,\nEpk (\u03a6) = Epk,max e\u2212\u03a6/\u03a60 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Epk,max is the maximum value of Epk within the pulse, and \u03a60 is the exponential\ndecay constant. The photon fluence is the photon flux integrated from the time of Epk,max .\nThe authors found that 35 of the 37 pulses in the study were consistent or marginally\nconsistent with the relation. Furthermore, they concluded that the decay constant is\nconstant from pulse to pulse within a GRB. This view was, however, challenged by Crider\net al. (1998) who dismissed the apparent constancy as consistent with drawing values out\nof a narrow statistical distribution of \u03a60 , which they found to be log-normal with a mean of\nlog\u03a60 = 1.75 \u00b1 0.07 and a FWHM of \u2206log\u03a60 = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1. This result is probably affected\nby selection effects. They studied a larger sample, including 41 pulses within 26 bursts, by\nusing the algorithm introduced by Norris et al. (1996) to identify pulses. Another approach\nwas also introduced, in which they used the energy fluence instead of the photon fluence.\nThe two approaches are very similar and do not fundamentally change the observed trends\nof the decay. These results confirm the correlation and extend the number of pulses in\nwhich the correlation is found. The exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) was also used by Ryde &\nSvensson (1999) in their analytical derivation of the shape of the time-integrated spectrum\nof an entire pulse decay, taking the spectral evolution into account.\n\n2.3.\n\nSelf-consistent Description of the Evolution\n\nA major step for quantifying the spectral/temporal behavior of GRBs was taken by\nRS00, where the combination of the two correlations, i.e., the HIC Epk (N) and the HFC\nEpk (\u03a6) as given by equations (4) and (5) was studied. Neither of these correlations includes\nany explicit time dependence of the spectral evolution. However, combined they do, as the\nfluence, \u03a6, is the time integral of the flux, N. This was used in RS00 to synthesize and find\na compact and quantitative description of the time evolution of the decay phase of a GRB\npulse. They showed that a power law HIC Epk (N) and an exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) result\nin the decay phase of the pulse following power-law behaviors:\nN0\n;\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )\nEpk,0\nEpk (t) =\n,\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )\u03b4\nN(t) =\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere the initial values at the start of the pulse decay are (N0 , Epk,0 ) and the number of\nadditional parameters is limited to two, the time constant \u03c4 (where N[t = \u03c4 ] = N0 /2) and\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe HIC index \u03b4. Note that the origin of the time variable, t, is at the start of the decay.\nThe peak energy has a similar dependence as the intensity, differing only in the correlation\nindex \u03b4. Note also that equations (6) and (7) are segments of power law decays with their\nformal origins of infinite N(t) and Epk (t) at t = \u2212\u03c4 . The exponential decay constant of the\nHFC Epk (\u03a6), introduced and defined by Liang & Kargatis (1996), is given by \u03a60 \u2261 N0 \u03c4 /\u03b4,\nand thus the characteristic time scale of the decay, the time constant, \u03c4 \u2261 \u03b4\u03a60 /N0 . Finally,\nR\ncalculating \u03a6(t) = N(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 gives rise to equation (2). The formulation, given by equations\n(6) and (7), is equivalent to the two empirical relations, equations (4) and (5), both of\nwhich have been proven to be valid in many cases. RS00 studied a complete sample of 83\nGRB pulses in this context, fitting both of the original two correlations, as well as the new\nequivalent formulation and found that this behavior is common (i.e., in 45 % of the pulse\ndecays).\nIn this work, we will analyze in detail the cases which do not follow the standard\ndescription given by equations (6) and (7). According to the results in RS00, a pulse light\ncurve that does not show this time behavior will, by necessity, have a different HIC Epk (N)\nand/or HFC Epk (\u03a6).\n\n3.\n\nData and Methods\n3.1.\n\nObservations\n\nOur work was conducted on data taken by BATSE on board the CGRO (Fishman\net al. 1989) during its entire mission from April 1991 until June 2000. BATSE consisted\nof eight modules placed on each corner of the satellite, which gave full sky coverage.\nThe modules comprised two types of detectors: the Large Area Detector (LAD) and the\nSpectroscopy Detector (SD). The former had a larger collecting area and was suited for\nspectral continuum studies, while the latter was designed for studies of spectral features\n(lines). For our spectral analysis we used the high energy resolution (HER) background\nand burst data types from the LADs which have 128 energy channels. The burst data have\na time resolution in multiples of 64 ms. The CGRO Science Support Center (GROSSC) at\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) provides these data as processed, high-level products\nin its public archive. Data are available for all the detectors that triggered on the bursts\n(often 3 or 4 of the detectors closest to the line-of-sight to the burst location). Models\nof the relevant Detector Response Matrix (DRM) for each observation are also provided\n(Pendleton et al. 1995). The eight modules of BATSE made it possible to localize the\nGRB, which is important since the DRM depends on the source-to-detector axis angle.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nWe also used the concatenated 64 ms resolution LAD data for visual inspection of the\nlight curve. These data are also provided by GROSSC, and are a concatenation of the three\nBATSE data types: DISCLA, PREB, and DISCSC.\n\n3.2.\n\nSelection of the Sample\n\nTo select a complete sample of strong bursts, we started by selecting the bursts in\nthe Current BATSE Catalog5 , up to GRB 000526 (BATSE trigger 8121), for which it is\npossible to measure peak fluxes. These are approximately 80% of the total 2702 bursts\nobserved. The reason that the peak flux is not measured for the remaining bursts is data\ngaps and/or missing data types. The Current BATSE Catalog is preliminary, but bursts up\nto GRB 960825 (trigger 5586) were published in the 4th BATSE Catalogue (Paciesas et al.\n1999). The threshold we chose for accepting a burst was that the peak flux (50\u2013300 keV in\n1.024 s time resolution) must be more than 5 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 , which resulted in a set of\n190 bursts.\nThis set was examined visually, burst by burst, using the concatenated 64 ms resolution\ndata. We searched for bursts containing long pulse structures with a general \"fast rise-slow\ndecay\" shape, often referred to as \"fast rise-exponential decays\" (FREDs). No analytical\nfunction describing the pulse shape was assumed. The reason for using such a loose\ndefinition is to have a sample that is independent of any preconceived idea of the pulse\nshape. The whole selection procedure is similar to the one made in Borgonovo & Ryde\n(2001).\nFor the time-resolved spectroscopy, we use a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the\nobservations of \u2265 30, which leads to light curves consisting of only a few broad time bins.\nTo perform detailed time-resolved spectroscopy it has been shown that a S/N \u223c 45 is\nneeded (Preece et al. 1998). We apply this as much as possible. However, since the aim of\nour spectral analysis on every time bin is mainly to determine the peak energy as a measure\nof the hardness and to deconvolve the count spectrum to find the photon flux, we allow\nourselves to use a lower S/N, sometimes as low as 30 for weak bursts. In these cases, we\ncheck that the results are consistent with higher S/N ratios. This gives us the possibility\nto study the burst pulses with higher time-resolution, especially for the later time bins.\nWe need as many time bins as possible to study the spectral evolution. For this\npurpose, we adopt the criterion that the decay phase of the pulses should have at least 8\n5\n\nhttp://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/batse/\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ntime bins with S/N = 30 to be included in the study.\nThese criteria resulted in a sample of 25 pulses within 23 bursts, i.e., \u2248 1% of the\noriginal BATSE catalog. This set is presented in Table 1, where the bursts are denoted by\nboth their BATSE catalog and trigger numbers. In this Table, there is also information on\nthe detector from which the data were taken, the time interval, and the number of time\nbins (nbins ) with which each pulse decay was studied (see also the Discussion in \u00a7 7). Note\nthat the time variable starts at the trigger time.\n\n3.3.\n\nSpectral Modeling\n\nThe central part of the analysis was performed with the WINGSPAN package, version\n4.4.1 (Preece et al. 1996), provided by the CGRO Science Support Center at GSFC. The\nspectral fitting was done using the MFIT package, version 4.6, running under WINGSPAN.\nWe always chose the data taken with the detector which was closest to the line-of-sight to\nthe GRB, as it has the strongest signal (see Table 1 for the individual cases). The broadest\nenergy band with useful data was selected, often 25 \u2212 1900 keV. A background estimate was\nmade using the HER data, which consist of low time-resolution measurements (16 \u2212 500\ns) stored between triggers. The light curve of the background during the outburst was\nmodeled by interpolating these data, approximately 1000 s before and after the trigger,\nusing a polynomial fit, typically of second or third order.\nFor each time bin to be studied, the photon spectrum with the background subtracted,\nNE (E), is then determined by using the forward-folding technique. An empirical spectral\nmodel is folded through the appropriate DRM and is then fitted by minimizing the \u03c72\n(using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, see, e.g., Press et al. 1992) between the model\ncount spectrum and the observed count spectrum, giving the best-fit spectral parameters\nand the normalization. The spectra were modeled with the empirical function (Band et al.\n1993):\n(\nA E \u03b1 e\u2212E/E0 if (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)E0 \u2265 E\nNE (E) =\n(8)\nA\u2032 E \u03b2\nif (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)E0 < E ,\nwhere E is the photon energy, E0 is the e\u2212folding energy, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the asymptotic power\nlaw indices, A is the amplitude, and A\u2032 has been chosen to make the photon spectrum\nNE (E) a continuous and a continuously differentiable function through the condition\nA\u2032 = A [(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)E0 ]\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 e\u2212(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe power law indices, \u03b1 and \u03b2, were always left free to vary. The photon energy, Epk , at\nwhich the E 2 NE -spectrum peaks, is used as a measure of the spectral hardness instead of\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nE0 . These are related through Epk = (2 + \u03b1)E0 and a peak exists only when \u03b2 < \u22122. The\nphoton spectrum arrived at is model-dependent. However, as the Band et al. function (eq.\n[8]), often gives a good model of the spectra, the photon spectrum found by deconvolving\nthe count spectrum should correspond well with the true photon spectrum. The fitting\nprocedure then has 4 free parameters: A, \u03b1 and \u03b2, and Epk . For every time bin, the\ninstantaneous, integrated photon flux, N(t), is found by integrating the modeled photon\nspectrum (NE ) over the available energy band of the detector.\nWe start off by analyzing the light curves in the sample with the non-linear\nLevenberg-Marquardt method with the statistical weights given by the observed errors.\n\n4.\n\nAnalysis of the Decays of the Pulse Light Curves\n\nThe main target of this study is the early decay phases of long, bright pulses. Apart\nfrom the discussion in \u00a7 2.1 on possible changes in the decay rate of the light curve, there\nare additional reasons to be cautious when deciding which time interval should be used in\nthe study. Firstly, we are studying the deconvolved (photon) spectra which often eventually\nbecome affected by the limited energy range of the detector. Secondly, to achieve the\nrequired S/N ratio, late time bins often become relatively broad. The time assigned to this\nflux data point is in the middle of the time bin, which, in general, is not exactly correct,\nand thus can affect details in the analysis. The time interval and the number of time bins\nused in the statistical analysis for each pulse in the study are shown in Table 1.\nAs discussed in \u00a7 2.1, there is no consensus on what shape the pulse decays of the\nphoton flux have. Both stretched exponentials and power law decays have been used to fit\nthe data. We therefore fit the light curves of our complete sample with the following two\ngeneral functions; a generalized power law decay:\nN(t) =\n\nN0\n,\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )n\n\n(10)\n\n(of which eq. [6] is the special case, n = 1), and the stretched exponential decay of equation\n(1).\nThe results of the fits of the decay phases in the sample are given in Tables 2, 3, and\n7. Table 2 (see also Fig. [8]) gives the results of the fits to equation (10) for every pulse,\ni.e., the parameters N0 , \u03c4 , and n, as well as the reduced \u03c72 values of the fits. In Table 3,\nthe parameter values, N0 , \u03c4d , and \u03bd, from the fit to equation (1), are given for all pulses.\nThe \u03c72 values in these two Tables should be judged with some caution due to the reasons\nmentioned above. Furthermore, overlapping and unresolved, minor pulses, which are not\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmodeled, could also be present. Comparison between fits are still instructive and the overall\nconclusion is, nevertheless, that the power law function is a better description (having\na lower \u03c72 value) of the pulse decays than a stretched exponential in all cases but three\n(triggers 1085, 1625, and 3765). In these three cases, however, the stretched exponential\nfunction is only marginally better. In an additional two cases, triggers 973 and 1121, the\npower law function is not constrained at all. Both of these cases have a large peakedness\nparameter (\u03bd > 1), i.e., they have an exponential or faster decay, and, in fact, the stretched\nexponential of equation (1) provides a good fit.\nIn Figure 8, a continuous histogram of the power law index, n, found for the pulses\nin the sample is shown. The histogram is constructed by summing Gaussian functions\nwhich have the values of the mean and the variance found from the fits. In this Figure, the\nspecific spectral-temporal behavior discussed in RS00 is clearly seen as the peak at n \u223c 1.\nThe second important result given by this analysis is the apparent bimodal distribution of\nthe index n, in which there is a second maximum close to n = 3. The width is larger here,\nsince the larger the n values are, the larger the uncertainties in the measurements are. The\nnumber of cases are approximately the same (11 and 12 cases) above and below n \u223c 2. As\nthe behavior with n \u223c 1 is apparently not ubiquitous, we will explore analytically other\ntypes of analytical spectral/temporal behaviors, i.e., cases with n sufficiently different from\n1.\nA similar continuous histogram of the peakedness parameter, \u03bd, of the stretched\nexponential fits is shown in Figure 8. We note that \u03bd, in general, is less than 1 and that the\ndistribution peaks at approximately 0.75, i.e., almost all fitted pulse decays are stretched\nexponentials, rather than compressed ones. Here the two cases that were not constrained\nby the power law function, i.e., triggers 973 and 1121, are seen at \u03bd = 1.26 and \u03bd = 1.0.\nThe photon fluence associated with equation (10) when n differs from 1 becomes\n\u03a6(t) =\n\no\nN0 \u03c4 n\n1 \u2212 (1 + t/\u03c4 )\u2212(n\u22121) ,\nn\u22121\n\nn 6= 1.\n\n(11)\n\nFits of this function to the fluence data are presented in Figure (8) and the parameters\nobtained are shown in Table 7. The n value were fixed to the value obtained from the\nlight curve fits of equation (10). The evolution of the fluence associated with the stretched\nexponential decay of the photon flux, N(t), (eq. [1]) is given in an Appendix and was not\nused in the analysis.\nTo complete all aspects of the spectral/temporal evolution of the pulses in the sample,\nthe temporal evolution of the peak energy, Epk (t), according to equation (7) with the\nexponent, \u03b4\u2217 was studied. The results are presented in Figure (8) and the parameters\nobtained in Table 2. The exponent \u03b4\u2217 differs from \u03b4 when n is not equal to 1 in equation\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n(10). The time constant, \u03c4 , was frozen in these fits to the value obtained from the fits of\nequation (10) to the light curve. In Figure 8, a continuous histogram of the \u03b4\u2217 -values from\nthe fits to Epk (t) (eq. [7]) is shown. There are no obviously preferred values of \u03b4\u2217 .\n\n5.\n\nAnalytical Description of Generalized Pulse Decay Behaviors\n\nAs discussed in the Introduction, we will use the light curve, N(t), as the point of\ndeparture for our analysis. In \u00a7 4, we found that the power law function, equation (10), is\na better description of the pulse decays than equation (1). From now on, we assume that\npulse decays can be described as power law decays.\nTherefore we consider that the pulse decay follows equation (10), for a power law index,\nn, different from the previously studied standard case, n = 1, in RS00. The associated\nfluence is given by equation (11), which, for n larger than 1, converges to the asymptotic\nvalue f0 \u2261 N0 \u03c4 /(n \u2212 1).\nNow, we consider two different alternatives. First, for GRB pulse light curves whose\ndecays follow equation (10), and for which the HFC Epk (\u03a6) is an exponential given by\nequation (5), the HIC Epk (N) will follow\n(\n\nf0\nEpk (N) = Epk,0 exp\n\u03a60\n\n\"\u0012\n\nN\nN0\n\n\u0013(n\u22121)/n\n\n\u22121\n\n#)\n\n,\n\nn 6= 1.\n\n(12)\n\nNote that f0 /\u03a60 is a dimensionless constant. When ln(N0 /N) \u226a 2n/|n \u2212 1| the HIC in\nequation (12) approaches a power law with the exponent \u03b4/n, which becomes identical to\nthe original power law HIC in equation (4), as n tends to 1. The difference between the\ndifferent HIC behaviors is best seen at the end of the decay of the pulse.\nOn the other hand, if the HIC Epk (N) actually is a power law given by equation (4),\nthen the HFC Epk (\u03a6) follows\nEpk (\u03a6) = Epk,0\n\n\u03a6\n1\u2212\nf0\n\n!n\u03b4/(n\u22121)\n\n,\n\nn 6= 1,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich behaves similarly to equation (5) when \u03a6 \u226a f0 , and becomes identical to that\nequation, if, in addition, n tends to 1. At the asymptotic value of \u03a6 = f0 , the peak energy\nhas converged to zero.\nThe time evolution of Epk (t) for the two cases is readily obtained by inserting N(t),\nfrom equation (10), into equation (12), and by inserting \u03a6(t) (eq.[11]) into equation (13).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe two resulting time behaviors are\n(\n\n)\n\ni\nf0 h\nEpk (t) = Epk,0 exp\n(1 + t/\u03c4 )\u2212(n\u22121) \u2212 1 ,\n\u03a60\n\n(14)\n\nEpk (t) = Epk,0 (1 + t/\u03c4 )\u2212\u03b4\u2217 ,\n\n(15)\n\nand\nwith \u03b4\u2217 \u2261 n\u03b4.\nIn an Appendix, we consider for completeness the stretched exponential pulse shape\n(eq. [1]), and its two corresponding correlations, the HIC Epk (N) and the HFC Epk (\u03a6),\nrespectively.\n\n6.\n\nThree Complete Spectral/Temporal Pictures\n\nAssuming that the decay phase of a pulse behaves as the power law function in equation\n(10), the whole spectral/temporal description will be complete according to RS00 for n = 1\nand to \u00a75 above for n 6= 1. Here, we consider three different cases, the one discussed in\nRS00 and \u00a7 2.3, and the two alternatives discussed in \u00a7 5:\ni) The two correlations given by a power law HIC Epk (N) (eq. [4]) and an exponential\nHFC Epk (\u03a6) (eq. [5]) are fitted to the data. Consequently the power law pulse decay has\nthe index n = 1. In Table 4, we present the results, i.e., fitting the power law HIC Epk (N)\n(eq. [4]) gives the parameters, Epk,0 and \u03b4, and fitting the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) (eq. [5])\ngives the parameters, Epk,0 and \u03a60 . For the HIC fit, N0 , was frozen to the values in Table 2.\nii) The pulse decay is fitted as a power law of index n, the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6)\n(eq. [5]) is assumed to be valid, and a fit is made to the generalized HIC Epk (N) of \u00a7 5 (eq.\n[12]). Parameters for the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) can be found in Table 4. In Table 5,\nwe present the fitting parameters of the generalized HIC Epk (N) (eq. [12]), i.e., Epk,0 and\nf0 /\u03a60 . N0 and n were frozen to the values in Table 2.\niii) The pulse decay is fitted as a power law of index n, the power law HIC Epk (N)\n(eq. [4]) is assumed to be valid, and a fit is made to a generalized HFC Epk (\u03a6) of \u00a7 5 (eq.\n[13]). Parameters for the power law HIC Epk (N) can be found in Table 4. In Table 5, we\npresent the fitting parameters of the generalized HFC Epk (\u03a6) (eq. [13]), i.e., Epk,0 and \u03b4.\nf0 \u2261 N0 \u03c4 /(n \u2212 1) in equation (13) is frozen and calculated using N0 , \u03c4 , and n from Table 2.\nThe quality of the fits can be judged from the reduced \u03c72 values in the Tables. The\nreason we chose to freeze N0 , \u03c4 , and n was to have a consistency with the light curve fittings\nin Table 2 and as these parameters often could not be constrained if they were free to vary.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThe results are also presented in Figures 8. Here, the first panel in every horizontal\nstrip shows the DISCSC data (all four energy channels are used) and indicates the time\ninterval studied (also see Table 1). The second panel shows the light curve with the LAD\nHERB data in the chosen time binning. In some cases bins beyond the interval used for\nthe statistical analysis is shown and indicated in grey (cf. Table 1 and \u00a74). The best fit is\nindicated with a solid curve (see Table 2). The two right-hand panels, show the correlations,\nthe HIC Epk (N) in panel 3 and the HFC Epk (\u03a6) in panel 4. Case (i) (i.e., n = 1) is\nrepresented by the solid line in panel 3 (the power law HIC Epk (N)) and the dashed line\nin panel 4 (the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6)). Case (ii) is represented by the dashed curves in\nthe two panels, the generalized HIC Epk (N) in panel 3 and the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) in\npanel 4. Finally, case (iii) is represented by the solid curves in the two panels, the power\nlaw HIC Epk (N) in panel 3 and the generalized HFC Epk (\u03a6) in panel 4.\nFirst, note the self-consistent behavior of the about 10 cases with n \u223c 1 as was\nalready outlined and studied in RS00. For such cases, the power law HIC Epk (N) and the\nexponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) are valid simultaneously.\nFor the 11 pulse decays with n larger than 2, it could be the case that both the HIC\nEpk (N) and the HFC Epk (\u03a6) are described by completely new functions. However, it could\nalso be the case that only one, either the HIC Epk (N) or the HFC Epk (\u03a6), is different,\nleaving the other correlation valid independent of the shape of the light curve (i.e., of n).\nIn the results (Tables 4 and 5), there is such a correspondence, i.e., if the power law HIC\nEpk (N) in Table 4 gives a better fit than the generalized HIC Epk (N) in Table 5, then\nthe generalized HFC Epk (\u03a6) in Table 5 is a better fit than the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6)\nin Table 4 and vice versa. About half the cases point to the power law HIC Epk (N)\nbeing valid independent of the shape of the light curve, while the other half suggests the\nexponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) to be the one that is valid. Unfortunately, the correlations are not\nof sufficiently quality to distinctly favor one set or the other, which is also seen in the two\nright-hand panels in Figure 8.\nTo check the significance of these results and to find which pulses can with some\nconfidence be said to favor either a power law HIC or an exponential HFC, we study the\nfollowing. For every pulse, the pair with the best fits, i.e., either a power law HIC plus a\ngeneralized HFC or a generalized HIC plus an exponential HFC, are considered and we\nreanalyze the generalized correlation (given by either equation [12] or [13]) by letting the\nparameter n also be free to vary. The results are presented in Table 6. In 6 out of the 11\ncases, n is constrained. Four out of these give n-values that are the same to within the\nerrors as the values obtained from fitting the light curve (Table 2). For these cases, the\nspectral/temporal behavior is consistent and constrained. In the last two cases for which n\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nis constrained, the errors in the n-values are, however, so large that no certain conclusion\ncan be drawn.\nThe four cases (triggers 1625, 3492, 3765, and 5567) for which the correlations are\ngood enough to be able to draw any conclusions are all consistent with case (iii) above, i.e.,\na power law HIC Epk (N) (according to eq. [4]) and a generalized HFC Epk (\u03a6) (according\nto eq. [13]). These cases are marked with an asterisk in Figure 8 and the resulting\ngeneralized HFCs from having the n-parameter free to vary are also indicated in Figure 8\nby long-dashed curves in the right-hand panel for the four triggers. The HICs for these\nfour cases are also found to be described by power laws in the study of Borgonovo & Ryde\n(2001) and they are thus expected to have an HFC Epk (\u03a6) differing from an exponential.\n\n7.\n7.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nComments on the Analysis\n\nIn parentheses in Table 1, the total number of bins which were studied is given. The\nextra time bins are not included in the statistical analysis but are nonetheless included in\nFigure 8 in grey. In these cases, the light curves show details which motivate their exclusion.\nThis is especially seen in linear plots of the decay, i.e., when plotting the linear N(t)\u22121/n .\nThis is, for instance, seen for the pulse from trigger 6630 in Figure 1 in RS00. The inclusion\nof these data points often leads to a drastic increase in the error of the n-parameter with,\nalbeit, n still being consistent with the n from fitting only the earlier decay phase.\nSpecifically, for trigger 3492, the choice of the fitting time interval is motivated by\nits appearance in a 1/N(t)-plot, see Figure 8. The extra bump at 8 seconds could be\nan additional pulse. Fitting the whole interval out to 8.5 s with the power law function\n(eq.[10]) gives a very high, \u03c72 \u223c 30.\nFurthermore, for pulse 2083:2, only 8 out of the 11 analyzed time bins are used in our\nstudy. The reason for this is the low values of the measured peak energy, \u223c 20 keV, which\nis at or below the actual detector energy window, and should thus not be included in the\nstatistical analysis.\nThe strange behavior of trigger 3954 could be due to a track jump similar to the ones\ndiscussed by Borgonovo & Ryde (2001).\nThe light curve of trigger 3345 before and after the HERB data is very uneven and\ncomplicated. This makes the background estimate very difficult and affects the detailed\nanalysis and thus this case should be treated with some caution. We, therefore, choose a\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nS/N = 45. Note that Borgonovo & Ryde (2001) use a higher time resolution (and a lower\nS/N) and identify detailed structure in the HIC.\nFinally, trigger 7527 was chosen to be studied up to 12 s, for which the power law index\nof the photon flux decay was n = 1.2 \u00b1 0.6. Including the two last time bins, the index\nbecomes undetermined, n = 7 \u00b1 9. Again there is a distinct shoulder in the light curve\naround 12 s, which can be interpreted as being a result of a change of the radiative regime\nand, if included, results in the badly determined parameter n.\nBy requiring pulse decays to have several time bins with S/N = 30 \u2212 45 automatic\nleads to a biasing against short pulses with fast decays, and it should be noted that the\nconclusions of our work are only valid for bright and long pulses. The behavior of short\npulses in long bursts and short pulses in short bursts should be studied to find out whether\nthe spectral/temporal behavior differs in any manner. For this, more sensitive detectors are\nneeded.\n\n7.2.\n\nStretched Exponential\n\nFor our study of the decay shape of pulses, we have mainly been using the power law\ndecay function. However, we have also fitted the stretched exponential function. We found\nthat the distribution of the peakedness parameter of the stretched exponential function\npeaks at \u03bd \u223c 0.7, see Fig. (8). This is in contrast to the results of Norris et al. (1996),\nwho found \u03bd to lie predominantly between 1 and 2. Note, however, that there are several\nimportant differences between their work and ours. First of all, we study the pulses in\nphoton fluxes over the whole energy band of the BATSE detector, while Norris et al.\nstudied the photon count rate in the four individual channels. The pulse shape over the\nwhole spectral range is the sum of the pulse shapes for the individual channels. We also\nonly study long pulses. Moreover, we study exclusively the decay phase of the pulses,\nwhile the Norris et al. study includes also the rise phase using the same value for \u03bd. The\npeakedness parameter thus describes the sharpness of the peak. Finally, our criterion of\nsufficient S/N in at least 8 time bins for a pulse to be selected probably causes a bias\nagainst high-\u03bd pulses, as these decay too rapidly to satisfy the criterion.\nNote that the stretched exponential function was invented and used mainly as a\nparameterization and description of the light curve, and especially for that of the entire\npulse. We are searching for the self-consistent description of the total spectral and temporal\nbehavior and we have shown that the power law function is valid for most cases. It does\nnot merely serve as a multi-parameter function to fit the light curves, but it is a prediction\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nbased on the known evolution described by the two correlations.\n\n7.3.\n\nUnderlying Physical Mechanisms\n\nA general consideration for a radiative pulse, and also the motivation for concentrating\non the decay phase, is that the rise phase describes the energization of the emitting\nplasma and the size of the activated region, while the decay phase provides information\non the cooling. The different aspects of the behavior during the decay phase of a pulse,\ndemonstrated in this paper, reflects the underlying physics during this cooling phase.\nThere is, unfortunately no straight-forward physical interpretation of these relations. There\nare probably several different processes at action and a competition between these finally\ndecides the details in the spectral evolution.\nIn the standard fireball internal/external shock model every individual pulse is\nidentified with a separate emission episode, as a result of a collision between two shells in\nthe relativistic outflow (or as an interaction with the circum-burst interstellar medium)\nin which the ordered kinetic energy of the outflow is transformed into random energy of\nthe leptons which radiate. The main radiative processes considered for the BATSE band\nradiation is synchrotron emission or reprocessing of a low energy synchrotron spectrum\nby inverse Compton scattering. The main motivation for this is due to the efficiency of\nthese processes and the natural role they play in relativistic shocks. However, the radiative\ncooling time scales for these processes are, in general, very short (see for instance Ghisellini,\nCelotti, & Lazzati 2000) and therefore a direct interpretation of the pulses as a result of\nan impulsive heating with a subsequent decay is difficult. Rather a continuous acceleration\nof the leptons, competing with the radiative cooling, could be invoked to explain the time\nscales of the long pulses studied here. Thus the light curve probably reflects the change in\nplasma properties, such as the lepton energy distribution. The actual acceleration process\nwhich takes place in the shocks is not well understood and is mainly assumed to produce\na power law distribution of leptons. The observed spectral and temporal signatures during\npulse decays give insights into these processes. Ryde, Lloyd, & Petrosian (in preparation)\nstudy the synchrotron emission and the associated lepton distribution needed to reproduce\nthese signatures, especially the HIC Epk (N) since it seems to be one of the fundamental\nrelations.\nAs an alternative radiation mechanism, Liang (1997) and Liang et al. (1999) have\nexplored a thermal Comptonization model based on the observations of the HFC. An\nemitting system that reproduces the observations that the hardness of the instantaneous\nspectra decays exponentially with photon fluence is the following. Assume a confined\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nplasma that is subject to an impulsive energy release, heating the gas. Assume further that\nthere is a constant supply of soft photons that cools the hot electron gas in the plasma,\ngiving rise to thermal radiation and the radiated luminosity. With a thermal radiation\nprocess, e.g., saturated Comptonization, the averaged photon energy will correspond to the\nelectron temperature. The cooling of the electron gas then gives rise to the evolution of\nthe peak of the photon spectrum. The change of the total energy of the cloud, i.e., the\nluminosity radiated away, will therefore be proportional to the change in photon energy,\nif the number of electrons is constant. This is what is described by the power-law HFC.\nEquation (5) gives that the change of the photon energy will be proportional to the emitted\nflux: \u2212dEpk /dt \u221d N(t)Epk (t) \u221d F . Note that any thermal process will be able to reproduce\nthis relation. Also, as mentioned above, there is a continuous heating, for instance from\ndissipation of energy through shocks which complicates the picture.\nMoreover, kinematical and relativistic effects should also be considered. The dynamics\nof the actual shell crossing will be affected by the shell widths and the relative sizes of the\nLorentz factors and densities of the two shells and could contribute to the dispersion in the\nobserved behaviors. And as the radiation is emitted from a spherical symmetric surface\nexpanding at a relativistic speed, with Lorentz factors of 102 \u2212 103 , light travel effects could\nbecome as important as other effects. This will smear out any direct physical information\nin the spectra; see, for instance, Cen (1999). If this effect is indeed dominating, the pulse\nshape will no longer reflect the intrinsic temporal profile. Ryde et al. (in preparation) is\ninvestigating this issue in detail and comparing it to the observational results above.\nFinally, as emphasized by RS00 and in this paper, the different aspects of the spectral\nand temporal evolution are intimately linked to each other. It is therefore not enough to\nexplain only one aspect, such as the light curve decoupled from the spectral behavior. The\nfull spectral/temporal description should be tested for in any successful model attempting\nto describe the prompt GRB emission.\n\n8.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented and shown, through the two empirical correlations, the HFC Epk (\u03a6)\nand the HIC Epk (N), how we can characterize the variety of the decays of long, bright GRB\npulses. Since the light curve, N(t), is the best determined with relatively small errors (as\ncompared to the correlations, or Epk [t]) and gives the strongest constraint to the fits, we\nstart our exploration from the variety of shapes of the light curve. This leads us to find\nalternative Epk (N) and Epk (\u03a6) behaviors.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nA bimodality could be present, in that there are two preferred values of the index\nof the power-law light-curve, namely n \u223c 1 and n \u223c 3, with the sample divided into\napproximately two equally large sets by n \u223c 2. For the large n cases, we could identify 4\ncases for which the spectral/temporal behavior, i.e., the correlations, was constrained (even\nif n was free). These cases suggest that the power law HIC Epk (N) is valid independent of\nthe shape of the light curve, i.e., there is always the same power law correlation between the\nhardness and the intensity. The HFC Epk (\u03a6), on the other hand, is different for different\nlight curve behaviors according to equation (13), since the fluence is the time integral of the\ninstantaneous flux.\nThe important relations for a GRB pulse decay are, subsequently, the power law HIC\nEpk (N) and the light curve, N(t). However, it must be noted that this result should be\ntested on a larger sample of well determined HICs and HFCs to be able to clearly confirm\nour conclusions. A catalog of strong GRB pulses and their behaviors is in preparation.\nWe are grateful to the GROSSC at Goddard Space Flight Center for help during our\nwork with the BATSE data and the WINGSPAN program.

Note that the time\nconstant, \u03c4d , is different from \u03c4 . The range of \u03bd of interest from Figure 2 is 0.5 - 2.\nThe case \u03bd = 0.5 gives\n\u0012\n\n\u03a6(t) = 2N0 \u03c4d 1 \u2212 (1 +\n\nq\n\nt/td )e\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\nt/td\n\n\u0013\n\n(16)\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n. Now, assuming an exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) (eq. [5]) to be valid for the pulse decay gives\nthe following HIC\n\"\n\n2N0 \u03c4d\nN(t)\nN\nEpk (N) = Epk,0 exp \u2212\n1\u2212\n1 \u2212 ln\n\u03a60\nN0\nN0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013#!\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nFor a pure exponential pulse decay (i.e., \u03bd = 1), we get\n\u0010\n\n\u2212t/\u03c4d\n\n\u03a6(t) = N0 \u03c4d 1 \u2212 e\n\n\u0011\n\n= N0 \u03c4d\n\n!\n\n(18)\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nN(t)\n,\n1\u2212\nN0\n\nwhich for an exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) gives the HIC\n\"\n\nN0 \u03c4d\nN(t)\nEpk (N) = Epk,0 exp \u2212\n1\u2212\n\u03a60\nN0\n\n!#\n\nAs N approaches N0 this is the same relation as equation (4) with N0 \u03c4d /\u03a60 = \u03b4.\nCorrespondingly, t/\u03c4d tends to 0. For N \u226a N0 , the HICs differ and can thus be tested for\nin the observations.\nFor a Gaussian pulse profile (\u03bd = 2) we get\n\u221a\n\u03a6(t) = N0 \u03c4d ( \u03c0/2)erf(t/\u03c4d ),\n\n(20)\n\nwhere erf(x) is the Gauss error function. Combined with the exponential HFC Epk (\u03a6) , the\nHIC Epk (N) becomes\n\"\u221a\n#\nq\n\u03c0 N0 \u03c4d\nEpk (N) = Epk,0 exp\n(21)\nerf( \u2212lnN/N0 ) .\n2 \u03a60\nThus using a stretched exponential describing the light curve will, of necessity, make\nthe HIC Epk (N) more complicated. Instead of a power law relation between the hardness\nand the intensity, the HIC Epk (N) becomes complicated exponential relations.\nWe now assume that the power law HIC Epk (N) (eq. [4]) is valid instead of the\nexponential HFC Epk (\u03a6). An analytical solution can only be found for an exponential light\ncurve (\u03bd = 1). Solving for N/N0 in equation (18) and inserting in equation (4) gives\nEpk = Epk,0\n\n\u03a6(t)\n1\u2212\nN0 \u03c4d\n\n!\u03b4\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nAs \u03a6(t) approaches 0, this is the same relation as equation (5) with N0 \u03c4d /\u03a60 = \u03b4.\nCorrespondingly, t/\u03c4d tends to 0. For \u03a6 \u226b \u03a60 , the HFCs differ and can thus be tested for\nin the observations.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nBand, D., et al. 1993, ApJ, 413, 281\nBorgonovo, L., & Ryde, F. 2001, ApJ, 548, 770\nCen, R. 1999, ApJ, 517, L113\nCrider, A., Liang, E.
