We present results\nfrom lattice calculations that emphasize the deconfining as well as chiral symmetry\nrestoring features of the QCD transition, and discuss the thermodynamics of the\nhigh temperature phase.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlmost immediately after the ground-breaking demonstration that the numerical analysis of lattice regularized quantum field theories [1] can also provide quantitative results on fundamental non-perturbative properties of QCD [2] it has been\nrealized that this approach will also allow to study the QCD phase transition [3,4]\nand the equation of state of the quark-gluon plasma [5]. During the last 20 years\nwe have learned a lot from lattice calculations about the phase structure of QCD\nat finite temperature. In fact, we do understand quite well the thermodynamics\nin the heavy quark mass limit of QCD, the pure SU (3) gauge theory, and even\nhave calculated the critical temperature and the equation of state in this limit with\nan accuracy of a few percent. However, it is only now that we start to reach a\nlevel of accuracy in numerical calculations of QCD thermodynamics that allows to\nseriously consider quantitative studies of QCD with a realistic light quark mass\nspectrum. An important ingredient in the preparation of such calculations is the\ndevelopment of new regularization schemes in the fermion sector of the QCD Lagrangian, which allow to reduce discretization errors and also improves the flavour\nsymmetry of the lattice actions. The currently performed investigations of QCD\nthermodynamics provide first results with such improved actions and prepare the\nground for calculations with a realistic light quark mass spectrum.\nThe interest in analyzing the properties of QCD under extreme conditions is\ntwofold. On the one hand it is the goal to reach a quantitative description of the\nbehaviour of matter at high temperature and density. This does provide important\ninput for a quantitative description of experimental signatures for the occurrence\nof a phase transition in heavy ion collisions and should also help to understand\nbetter the phase transitions that occurred during the early times of the evolution\nof the universe. Eventually it also may allow to answer the question whether a\nquark-gluon plasma can exist in the interior of dense neutron stars or did exist\nin early stages of supernova explosions. For this reason one would like to reach a\nquantitative understanding of the QCD equation of state, determine critical parameters such as the critical temperature and the critical energy density and predict\n\n\f2\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\nthe modification of basic hadron properties (masses, decay widths) with temperature. On the other hand the analysis of a complicated quantum field theory like\nQCD at non-zero temperature can also help to improve our understanding of its\nnon-perturbative properties at zero temperature. The introduction of external control parameters (temperature, chemical potential) allows to observe the response\nof different observables to this and may provide a better understanding of their\ninterdependence [6]. As such one would, for instance, like to clarify the role of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking for the QCD phase transition. In which\nrespect is the QCD phase transition deconfining and/or chiral symmetry restoring?\nIn how far can the critical behaviour be described by intuitive pictures based on\npercolation, bag or resonance gas models which have been developed for the QCD\ntransition? We will discuss these qualitative aspects of the QCD thermodynamics\nand also present results on basic questions concerning the equation of state and the\ncritical temperature of the transition which ask for quantitative answers.\nIn the next section we give a short introduction into the lattice formulation of\nQCD thermodynamics. In Section 3 we discuss the basic structure of the QCD phase\ndiagram at finite temperature as it is known from lattice calculations. Section 4 is\ndevoted to a discussion of basic thermodynamic observables which characterize the\nQCD transition to the plasma phase and we will identify general properties which\nshow the deconfining and chiral symmetry restoring features of this transition. In\nSection 5 we comment on different length scales characterizing the QCD plasma and\ntry to establish the temperature regime where lattice calculations may make contact\nwith perturbative approaches. A description of recent results on the QCD equation\nof state and the critical temperature of the QCD transition which emphasizes the\nquark mass and flavour dependence of these quantities is given in Sections 6 and\n7, respectively. A brief discussion of the problems arising in lattice formulations of\nQCD at non-zero baryon number density or chemical potential is given in Section 8.\nFinally we give our conclusions in Section 9 and describe a specific set of improved\ngauge and fermion lattice actions in an Appendix.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThe Lattice Formulation of QCD Thermodynamics\nThe basic steps from continuum to lattice ...\n\nStarting point for the discussion of the equilibrium thermodynamics of QCD on the\nlattice is the QCD partition function, which explicitly depends on the volume (V ),\nthe temperature (T ) and the quark number chemical potential (\u03bc). It is represented\nin terms of a Euclidean path integral over gauge (A\u03bd ) and fermion (\u03c8\u0304, \u03c8) fields,\nZ(V, T, \u03bc) =\n\nZ\n\nDA\u03bd D\u03c8\u0304D\u03c8 e\u2212SE (V,T,\u03bc)\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A\u03bd and \u03c8\u0304, \u03c8 obey periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions in Euclidean time, respectively. The Euclidean action SE \u2261 SG + SF contains a purely\ngluonic contribution (SG ) expressed in terms of the field strength tensor, F\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 ig[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ], and a fermion part (SF ), which couples the gauge and\nfermions field through the standard minimal substitution,\nSE (V, T, \u03bc) \u2261 SG (V, T ) + SF (V, T, \u03bc)\n\n(2)\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\nSG (V, T ) =\n\nZ1/T\n\ndx0\n\nSF (V, T, \u03bc) =\n\nZ1/T\n\ndx0\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\n1\nTr F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\nV\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\nf =1\n\nV\n\n0\n\nnf\nX\n\n\u03c8\u0304f (\u03b3\u03bc [\u2202\u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc ] + mf \u2212 \u03bc\u03b30 ) \u03c8f .\n\n(4)\n\nHere mf are the different quark masses for the nf different quark flavours and g\ndenotes the QCD coupling constant.\nThe path integral appearing in Eq. 1 is regularized by introducing a four dimensional space-time lattice of size N\u03c33 \u00d7 N\u03c4 with a lattice spacing a. Volume and\ntemperature are then related to the number of points in space and time directions,\nrespectively,\nV = (N\u03c3 a)3\n\n,\n\nT \u22121 = N\u03c4 a\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWhile the discretization of the fermion sector, at least on the naive level, is straightforwardly achieved by replacing derivatives by finite differences, the gauge sector\nis a bit more involved. Here we introduce link variables U\u03bc (x) which are associated\nwith the link between two neighbouring sites of the lattice and describe the parallel\ntransport of the field A from site x to x + \u03bc\u0302a,\n\n\u0012 Z\n\nUx,\u03bc = P exp ig\n\nx+\u03bc\u0302a\n\ndx\u03bc A\u03bc (x)\n\nx\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere P denotes the path ordering. The link variables U\u03bc (x) are elements of the\nSU (3) colour group. A product of these link variables around an elementary plaquette may be used to define an approximation to the gauge action,\n(1,1)\nWn,\u03bc\u03bd\n=1\u2212\n\n1\nRe\n3\n\nn,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2261 Re Tr Un,\u03bc Un+\u03bc\u0302,\u03bd Un+\u03bd\u0302,\u03bc\nUn,\u03bd\n\n=\n\ng 2 a4 a a\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + O(a6 )\n2\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nA discretized version of the Euclidean gauge action, which reproduces the continuum version up to cut-off errors of order a2 , thus is given by the Wilson action\n[1],\n\u03b2SG = \u03b2\n\nX\n\nn\n0\u2264\u03bc<\u03bd\u22643\n\n(1,1)\nWn,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\u21d2\n\nZ\n\nd4 x LE + O(a2 )\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we have introduced the gauge coupling \u03b2 = 6/g 2 .\nAs is well-known the naive discretization of the fermionic part of the action,\nwhich is obtained by introducing the simple finite difference scheme to discretize the\nderivative appearing in the fermion Lagrangian, i.e. \u2202\u03bc \u03c8f (x) = (\u03c8n+\u03bc\u0302 \u2212 \u03c8n\u2212\u03bc\u0302 )/2a,\ndoes in the continuum limit not reproduce the particle content one started with.\nThe massless lattice fermion propagator has poles not only at zero momentum but\nalso at all other corners of the Brillouin zone and thus generates 16 rather than\na single fermion species in the continuum limit. One thus faces a severe species\ndoubling problem. The way out has been to either introduce an explicit chiral\n\n\f4\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\nsymmetry breaking term, which is proportional to a\u2202\u03bc2 \u03c8f (x) and thus vanishes\nin the continuum limit (Wilson fermions [1]), or to distribute the components of\nthe fermion Dirac spinors over several lattice sites (staggered fermions) [7]. The\nstaggered fermion formulation does not eliminate the species doubling problem\ncompletely. One still gets four degenerate fermion species. However, it has the\nadvantage that it preserves a continuous subgroup of the original global chiral\nsymmetry. In the massless limit the chiral condensate thus still is an order parameter\nfor the occurrence of a phase transition at finite temperature.\nProgress has been made in formulating lattice QCD also with chiral fermion\nactions which do avoid the species doubling and at the same time preserve the\nchiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian. This can, for instance, be achieved by\nintroducing an extra fifth dimension [8]. At present, however, very little has been\ndone to study QCD thermodynamics on the lattice with these actions [9]. Much\nmore is known on the QCD thermodynamics from calculations with Wilson and\nstaggered fermions. We will in the following present results from both approaches.\nHowever, to be specific we will restrict ourselves here to a discussion of the staggered\nfermion formulation introduced by Kogut and Susskind [7]. The fermion action can\nbe written as\nSFKS =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u0304n QKS\nnm \u03c7m\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nnm\n\nwhere the staggered fermion matrix QKS is given by\nQKS\nnm (mq , \u03bc\u0303) =\n\n3\n1X\n\u2020\n)\n(\u22121)n0 +...+n\u03bc\u22121 (\u03b4n+\u03bc\u0302,m Un,\u03bc \u2212 \u03b4n,m+\u03bc\u0302 Um,\u03bc\n2\n\u03bc=1\n\n1\n\u2020\n+ (\u03b4n+0\u0302,m Un,0 e\u03bc\u0303 \u2212 \u03b4n,m+0\u0302 Um,0\n) e\u2212\u03bc\u0303 + \u03b4nm mq\n2\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nHere we have introduced the chemical potential \u03bc\u0303 on the temporal links [10]. As the\nfermion action is quadratic in the Grassmann valued quark fields \u03c7\u0304 and \u03c7 we can\nintegrate them out in the partition function and finally arrive at a representation\nof Z(V, T, \u03bc) on a 4-dimensional lattice of size N\u03c33 \u00d7 N\u03c4 ,\nZ(N\u03c3 , N\u03c4 , \u03b2, mq , \u03bc\u0303) =\n\nZ Y\n\ndUn,\u03bd (det QKS (mq , \u03bc\u0303))nf /4 e\u2212\u03b2SG\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nn\u03bd\n\nWe have made explicit the fact that the staggered fermion action does lead to four\ndegenerate fermion flavours in the continuum limit, i.e. taking the continuum limit\nwith the action given in Eqs. 9 and 10 corresponds to nf = 4 in Eq. 11. As the\nnumber of fermion species does appear only as an appropriate power of the fermion\ndeterminant, which is true also in the continuum limit, one also may choose nf 6= 4\nin Eq. 11. This is the approach used to perform simulations with different number\nof flavours in the staggered fermion formulation.\nFor \u03bc\u0303 = 0 the fermion determinant appearing in Eq. 11 is real and positive.\nStandard numerical techniques, which rely on a probability interpretation of the\nintegrand in Eq. 11, thus can be applied. For \u03bc\u0303 6= 0 the determinant, however,\nbecomes complex. Although the contribution of the imaginary part can easily be\nshown to be zero, as it should to give a real partition function, the real part is no\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n5\n\nlonger strictly positive. This sign problem so far still constitutes a major problem\nin the application of numerical techniques to studies of QCD at non-zero baryon\nnumber density or non-zero chemical potential. We therefore will restrict our discussion of QCD thermodynamics mainly to the case \u03bc\u0303 \u2261 0 and will come back to\nthe problems one faces for \u03bc\u0303 6= 0 in Section 8.\n\n2.2\n\n... and back from the lattice to the continuum\n\nThe lattice discretized QCD action discussed above reproduces the continuum action up to discretization errors of O(a2 ). In order to perform the continuum limit\nat constant temperature, we will have to take the limit (a \u2192 0, N\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e) with\nT = 1/N\u03c4 a fixed. In particular, for bulk thermodynamic observables like the pressure and energy density, which have dimension [T 4 ] this limit is rather cumbersome.\nAll lattice observables are dimensionless and are thus calculated in appropriate units\nof the lattice spacing a. As a consequence a calculation of, e.g., the pressure will\nprovide pa4 and thus yields a numerical result which decreases in magnitude like\nN\u03c4\u22124 . Numerical calculation, however, are always based on the analysis of a finite\nset of suitably generated gauge field configurations and thus produce results which\nhave a statistical error. It therefore rapidly becomes difficult to calculate bulk thermodynamic quantities on lattices with large temporal extent N\u03c4 . For this reason\nit is of particular importance for finite temperature calculations to be able to use\nactions which have small discretization errors and thus allow to perform calculations on lattices with moderate temporal extent. Such actions have been developed\nand successfully applied in thermodynamic calculations for the pure SU (3) gauge\ntheory. In the fermion sector appropriate actions, which reduce cut-off effects in\nthe high temperature ideal gas limit, so far have only been constructed for staggered fermions. As an example we describe a specific choice of improved gauge and\nstaggered fermion actions in more detail in an Appendix.\nAs mentioned above we have to perform the continuum limit in order to eliminate lattice discretization errors and to arrive finally at quantitative predictions\nfor the QCD thermodynamics. Eventually we thus have to analyze our observables\non different size lattices and extrapolate our results to N\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e at fixed temperature. Unless we perform calculations at a well defined temperature, e.g. the critical\ntemperature, we will have to determine the temperature scale from an additional\n(zero-temperature) calculation of an observable for which we know its physical value\n(in MeV). This requires a calculation at the same value of the cut-off (same values\nof the bare couplings). Of course, we know such a quantity only for the physical\ncase realized in nature, i.e. QCD with two light up and down quark flavours and a\nheavier strange quark. Nonetheless, we have good reason to believe that certain observables are quite insensitive to changes in the quark masses, e.g. quenched hadron\nmasses1 (m\u0303H ) or the string tension (\u03c3\u0303) are believed to be suitable observables to\nset a physical scale even in the limit of infinite quark masses (pure SU (3) gauge\n1\n\nA physical observable O is calculated on the lattice as dimensionless quantity,\nwhich we denote here by \u00d5. Quite often, however, we will also adopt the customary lattice notation, which explicitly specifies the cut-off dependence in the\ncontinuum limit, e.g. m\u0303H \u2261 mH a or \u03c3\u0303 \u2261 \u03c3a2 .\n\n\f6\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\ntheory). We thus may use calculations of these quantities to define a temperature\nscale,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(12)\nT / \u03c3 = 1/ \u03c3\u0303N\u03c4 or T /mH = 1/m\u0303H N\u03c4 .\nIn the pure SU (3) gauge theory as well as in the massless limit the lattice spacing\nis controlled through \u03b2, the only bare coupling appearing in the Euclidean action.\nAsymptotically a and \u03b2 are then related through the leading order renormalization\ngroup equation,\n2\n\na\u039bL \u2243 (6b0 /\u03b2)\u2212b1 /2b0 e\u2212\u03b2/12b0\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the two universal coefficients are given by,\nb0 =\n\n1\n16\u03c0 2\n\n\u0010\n\n11 \u2212\n\n2\nnf\n3\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\nb1 =\n\n\u0010 1 \u00112 h\n16\u03c0 2\n\n\u0010\n\n102 \u2212 10 +\n\n8\nnf\n3\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nand \u039bL is a scale parameter which unambiguously can be related to the scale\nparameter in other regularization schemes, e.g. to \u039bM S . The continuum limit thus\nis reached with increasing \u03b2.\nIn the case of non-zero quark masses one has in addition to insure that the\ncontinuum limit is taken along a line of constant physics. This can be achieved by\nkeeping a ratio of hadron masses, for instance the ratio of pseudo-scalar and vector\nmeson masses, mP S /mV , constant while varying the couplings (\u03b2, mq ). In the limit\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e this requires a tuning of the bare quark masses such that mq \u2192 0. We also\nnote that for small quark masses the vector meson mass mV approaches a constant,\nmV = m\u03c1 +O(mq ), while the pseudo-scalar is the Goldstone-particle corresponding\nto the broken chiral symmetry of QCD (pion). Its mass is proportional to the\nsquare root of mq . In the following we will quite often quote results as a function\nof mP S /mV which is just another way for quoting results for different values of the\nquark mass.\n\n3\n\nThe QCD Phase Diagram at Finite Temperature\n\nAt vanishing baryon number density (or zero chemical potential) the properties of\nthe QCD phase transition depend on the number of quark flavours and their masses.\nWhile it is a detailed quantitative question at which temperature the transition\nto the high temperature plasma phase occurs, we do expect that the nature of\nthe transition, e.g. its order and details of the critical behaviour, are controlled by\nglobal symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian. Such symmetries only exist in the limits\nof either infinite or vanishing quark masses. For any non-zero, finite value of quark\nmasses the global symmetries are explicitly broken. In fact, in the case of QCD the\nexplicit symmetry breaking induced by the finite quark masses is very much similar\nto that induced by an external ferromagnetic field in spin models. We thus expect\nthat a continuous phase transition, which may exist in the zero or infinite quark\nmass limit, will turn into a non-singular crossover behaviour for any finite value of\nthe quark mass. First order transitions, on the other hand, may persist for some\ntime before they end in a continuous transition. Whether a true phase transition\nexists in QCD with the physically realized spectrum of quark masses or whether\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n7\n\nin this case the transition is just a (rapid) crossover, again becomes a quantitative\nquestion which we have to answer through direct numerical calculations.\nOur current understanding of the qualitative aspects of QCD phase diagram is\nbased on universality arguments for the symmetry breaking patterns in the heavy\n[11] as well as the light quark mass regime [12,13]. In the limit of infinitely heavy\nquarks, the pure SU (3) gauge theory, the large distance behaviour of the heavy\nquark free energy, Fq\u0304q , provides a unique distinction between confinement below\nTc and deconfinement for T > Tc . On a lattice of size N\u03c33 \u00d7 N\u03c4 the heavy quark\nfree energy2 can be calculated from the expectation value of the Polyakov loop\ncorrelation function\n\n\u0012\n\nexp \u2212\n\nFq\u0304q (r, T )\nT\n\n\u0013\n\n= hTrLx TrL\u2020y i\n\n,\n\nrT = |x \u2212 y|N\u03c4\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Lx and L\u2020y represent static quark and anti-quark sources located at the\nspatial points x and y, respectively,\nLx =\n\nN\u03c4\nY\n\nx0 =1\n\nUn,0\n\n,\n\nn \u2261 (x0 , x)\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nFor large separations\n(r \u2192 \u221e) the correlation function approaches |hLi|2 , where\nP\nhLi = N\u03c3\u22123 h x TrLx i denotes the Polyakov loop expectation value, which therefore\ncharacterizes the behaviour of the heavy quark free energy at large distances and\nis an order parameter for deconfinement in the SU (3) gauge theory,\nhLi\n\nn\n\n= 0 \u21d4 confined phase,\n> 0 \u21d4 deconfined phase,\n\nT < Tc\nT > Tc\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nThe effective theory for the order parameter is a 3-dimensional spin model with\nglobal Z(3) symmetry. Universality arguments then suggest that the phase transition is first order in the infinite quark mass limit [11].\nIn the limit of vanishing quark masses the classical QCD Lagrangian is invariant under chiral symmetry transformations; for nf massless quark flavours the\nsymmetry is\nUA (1) \u00d7 SUL (nf ) \u00d7 SUR (nf ).\nHowever, only the SU (nf ) flavour part of this symmetry is spontaneously broken in\nthe vacuum, which gives rise to (n2f \u22121) massless Goldstone particles, the pions. The\naxial UA (1) only is a symmetry of the classical Lagrangian. It is explicitly broken\ndue to quantum corrections in the QCD partition function, the axial anomaly, and\ntherefore gets replaced by a discrete Z(nf ) symmetry at low temperature. The basic\nobservable which reflects the chiral properties of QCD is the chiral condensate,\nh\u03c7\u0304\u03c7i =\n2\n\n1\n\u2202\nln Z\nN\u03c33 N\u03c4 \u2202mq\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nIn the T \u2192 0 limit this is just the heavy quark potential; at non-zero temperature\nFq\u0304q does, however, also include a contribution resulting from the overall change\nof entropy that arises from the presence of external quark and anti-quark sources.\n\n\f8\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\nIn the limit of vanishing quark masses the chiral condensate stays non zero as\nlong as chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. The chiral condensate thus is an\nobvious order parameter in the chiral limit,\nh\u03c7\u0304\u03c7i\n\nn\n\n> 0 \u21d4 symmetry broken phase,\n= 0 \u21d4 symmetric phase,\n\nT < Tc\nT > Tc\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nFor light quarks the global chiral symmetry is expected to control the critical\nbehaviour of the QCD phase transition. In particular, the order of the transition is\nexpected to depend on the number of light or massless flavours. The basic aspects of\nthe nf -dependence of the phase diagram have been derived by Pisarski and Wilczek\n[12] from an effective, 3-dimensional Lagrangian for the order parameter3 ,\nLef f =\n\n\u00012\n1\n1\n\u03c02\n\u2212 Tr(\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2020 \u2202 \u03bc \u03a6) \u2212 m2 Tr(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6) +\ng1 Tr(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)\n2\n2\n3\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c02\n,\n+ g2 Tr (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)2 + c det \u03a6 + det \u03a6\u2020\n3\n\n(20)\n\nwith \u03a6 \u2261 (\u03a6ij ), i, j = 1, ..., nf . Lef f has the same global symmetry as the QCD\nLagrangian. A renormalization group analysis of this Lagrangian suggests that the\ntransition is first order for nf \u2265 3 and second order for nf = 2. The latter, however,\nis expected to hold only if the axial UA (1) symmetry breaking, related to the det \u03a6\nterms in Eq. 20, does not become too weak at Tc so that the occurrence of a\nfluctuation induced first order transition would also become possible.\nThis basic pattern has indeed been observed in lattice calculations. So far no\nindication for a discontinuous transition has been observed for nf = 2. The transition is found to be first order for nf \u2265 3. Moreover, the transition temperature\nis decreasing with increasing nf and there are indications that chiral symmetry is\nalready restored in the vacuum above a critical number of flavours [15].\nThe anticipated phase diagram of 3-flavour QCD at vanishing baryon number\ndensity is shown in Fig. 1. An interesting aspect of the phase diagram is the occurrence of a second order transition line in the light quark mass regime, the boundary\nof the region of first order phase transitions. On this line the transition is controlled\nby an effective 3-dimensional theory with global Z(2) symmetry [13], which is not\na symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian. As this boundary lies in the light quark mass\nregime it may well be that this second order transition, for which neither the chiral\ncondensate nor the Polyakov loop will be the order parameter, is equally important\nfor the critical or crossover behaviour of QCD with a realistic quark mass spectrum\nas the nearby critical point in the chiral limit. In particular, we note that the critical\nexponent \u03b1 is positive for the 3-d, Z(2) symmetric models whereas it is negative for\nthe O(4) model. A nearby Z(2) symmetric critical point in the QCD phase diagram\nwill thus induce larger density fluctuations than would be expected in the vicinity\nof the chiral critical point. It therefore will be important to determine in detail the\nlocation of the physical point in the QCD phase diagram.\n\n3\n\nIt should be noted that this ansatz assumes that chiral symmetry is broken at\nlow temperatures. Instanton model calculations suggest that the vacuum, in fact,\nis chirally symmetric already for nf \u2265 5 [14].\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n9\n\n3- avour phase diagram\n\nT\u001f \u0018 175 MeV\nnf =2\n\nTd \u0018 270 MeV\n\nnf= 2\n\nPure\nGauge\n\n\u221e\n\n1st\norder\n\n2nd order\nO(4) ?\n\nmcrit\nPS ' 2 5 GeV\n:\n\n000\n111\n000\n111\n111\n000\n\ntric\n\nms\n\nnf= 3\n\n? phys.\n\nTn\u001f =3 \u0018 155 MeV\n\n?\n\nnf= 1\n\ncrossover\n\npoint\n\n1st\norder\n\n2nd order\nZ(2)\n\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n\nms\n\nmcrit\nPS ' 300 MeV\n\nf\n\n0\n0\n\nm u , md\n\n\u221e\n\nFig. 1. The QCD phase diagram of 3-flavour QCD with degenerate (u,d)-quark\nmasses and a strange quark mass ms .\n\n4\n\nDeconfinement versus Chiral Symmetry Restoration\n\nAs outlined in the previous section the two properties of QCD, which explain the\nbasic features of the observed spectrum of hadrons, are also of central importance\nfor the structure of the QCD phase diagram at finite temperature \u2013 confinement and\nchiral symmetry breaking. While the former explains why we observe only colourless states in the spectrum the latter describes the presence of light Goldstone\nparticles, the pions. The confining property of QCD manifests itself in the long\nrange behaviour of the heavy quark potential. At zero temperature the potential\nrises linearly at large distances4 , Vq\u0304q (r) \u223c \u03c3r, where \u03c3 \u2243 (425 MeV)2 denotes the\nstring tension, and forces the quarks and gluons to be confined to a hadronic bag.\nChiral symmetry breaking leads to a non-vanishing quark anti-quark condensate,\nhq\u0304qi \u2243 (250 MeV)3 in the vacuum. Inside the hadron bag, however, the condensate\nvanishes. At high temperatures the individual hadronic bags are expected to merge\nto a single large bag, in which quarks and gluons can move freely. This bag picture is closely related to percolation models for the QCD phase transition [16]. It\nprovides an intuitive argument for the occurrence of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration. A priory it is, however, not evident that both non-perturbative\nproperties have to get lost at the same temperature. It has been speculated that\ntwo distinct phase transitions leading to deconfinement at Td and chiral symmetry\nrestoration at T\u03c7 could occur in QCD [17]. General arguments about the scales\n4\n\nHere large distances actually refer to r \u2243 1 fm. For larger distances the spontaneous creation of quark anti-quark pairs from the vacuum leads to a breaking of\nthe string, i.e. the potential tends to a constant value for r \u2192 \u221e (see Fig. 4).\n\n\f10\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\ninvolved5 suggest that Td \u2264 T\u03c7 . Two distinct phase transitions indeed have been\nfound in QCD related models like the SU (3) gauge theory with adjoint fermions\n[18]. In QCD, however, there seems to be only one transition from the low temperature hadronic regime to the high temperature plasma phase. In fact, as can\nbe seen from Fig. 1 there is a wide range of parameters (quark masses) for which\nthe transition is not related to any singular behaviour in thermodynamic observables; instead of a phase transition one observes just a rapid crossover behaviour. It\nthus is legitimate to ask which thermodynamic properties change when one moves\nfrom the low to the high temperature regime and to what extent these changes are\nrelated to deconfinement and/or chiral symmetry restoration.\nIn the previous section we have introduced order parameters for deconfinement\nin the infinite quark mass limit, hLi, and chiral symmetry restoration in the limit\nof vanishing quark masses, h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i. Related observables, which also signal a sudden\nchange in the long distance behaviour of the heavy quark potential or the chiral\ncondensate as function of temperature, are the corresponding susceptibilities, the\nPolyakov loop susceptibility (\u03c7L ) and the chiral susceptibility (\u03c7m ),\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c7L = N\u03c33 hL2 i \u2212 hLi2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u03c7m =\n\n\u2202\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i\n\u2202mq\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nThe behaviour of these observables is shown in Fig. 2 for the case of two flavour\nQCD with light quarks. This clearly shows that the gauge coupling at which the\ndifferent susceptibilities attain their maxima, or correspondingly the points of most\nrapid change in hLi and h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i coincide. Calculations of these observables for QCD\nwith three degenerate quark flavours6 have been performed for a wide range of quark\nmasses [19]. They confirm that the location of maxima in both susceptibilities are\nindeed strongly correlated. Within statistical accuracy they occur at the same temperature, although the height of these maxima is strongly quark mass dependent.\nThis is shown in Fig. 3. For large (mP S /mV >\n\u223c0.3) quark\n\u223c0.9) and small (mP S /mV <\nmasses the Polyakov loop and chiral susceptibility, respectively, show a strong volume dependence, which is indicative for the presence of first order phase transitions\nin these corners of the phase diagram. Using zero temperature string tension calculations the pseudo-scalar meson masses have been estimated at which the first\norder transitions end in a second order transition. For better orientation in the\nphase diagram these estimates, which at present are not well established and certainly are still subject to lattice artifacts (discretization errors, flavour symmetry\nbreaking), are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen there is a broad range of quark (or\nmeson) masses for which the QCD transition to the high temperature phase is a\nnon-singular crossover.\nAs expected the first order phase transition in the large quark mass regime is\nmost clearly visible in the behaviour of the Polyakov loop susceptibility, i.e. the\nfluctuation of the order parameter for the confinement-deconfinement transition in\nthe pure gauge (mq \u2192 \u221e) limit. Similarly, the transition in the chiral limit is most\npronounced in the behaviour of the chiral condensate and its susceptibility. This\n5\n\n6\n\nThe hadronic bag is larger than the constituent quark bag of a current quark\nsurrounded by its gluon cloud.\nThis corresponds to calculations along the dotted, diagonal line in the phase\ndiagram shown in Fig. 1.\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n0.3\n\n11\n\n0.6\n\nL\n\n0.5\n\nm\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nL\n\nmq/T = 0.08\n\n0\n5.2\n\nmq/T = 0.08\n0\n5.4 5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\nFig. 2.

For finite quark\nmasses, however, the long distance behaviour of Fq\u0304q can no longer serve as an\norder parameter, the heavy quark free energy stays finite for all temperatures.\nThis is shown in Fig. 4 where we compare results from calculations in the pure\ngauge theory [20] with results from a calculation in three flavour QCD [19]. It is\napparent from this figure that there is no drastic qualitative change in the structure\nof the heavy quark free energy as one crosses the transition\u221atemperature. Although\nthe most rapid change in \u2206V \u2261 Fq\u0304q (\u221e) \u2212 Fq\u0304q (r = 0.5/ \u03c3) occurs for T \u2243 Tc\nand thus resembles the behaviour of the Polyakov loop expectation value and its\nsusceptibility shown in Fig. 2, the heavy quark free energy does not seem to be a\ngood indicator for deconfinement in the presence of light quarks. It looses its role\nas a rigorous order parameter and also does not reflect changes in the number of\npartonic degrees of freedom contributing to the thermodynamics.\nOn the other hand, we expect that bulk thermodynamic quantities like the\npressure do reflect the relevant number of degrees of freedom contributing to the\nthermodynamics in the high temperature limit. Due to asymptotic freedom the\nQCD pressure will approach the ideal gas value at infinite temperature. In this\nlimit the number of degrees of freedom (quarks+gluons) is much larger than the\nthree light pions which dominate the thermodynamics at low temperature,\np\n=\nT4\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n\n3 \u03c090\n(16 +\n\n2\n21\nn )\u03c0\n2 f 90\n\n, T \u21920\n, T \u2192\u221e\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n13\n\n5\np/T4\n\npSB/T\n\n4\n\n4\n3\n3 flavour\n2+1 flavour\n2 flavour\npure gauge\n\n2\n1\n\nT [MeV]\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nFig. 5. The pressure in QCD with different number of degrees of freedom as a function of temperature.

As can bee seen in Fig. 5 the pressure strongly reacts to changes in the\nnumber of degrees of freedom. It is this drastic change in the behaviour of the\npressure or the energy density which indicates that the QCD (phase) transition to\nthe plasma phase indeed is deconfining. However, it also is worthwhile to note that\nthe transition does, in fact, take place at rather small values of the pressure (and\nenergy density). Only for temperatures T >\n\u223c2Tc does the pressure come close to the\nideal gas limit so that one can, with some justification, identify the corresponding\nlight degrees of freedom. This is the case for QCD with light quarks as well as in\nthe quenched limit. At least for temperatures up to a few times Tc the dynamical\ndegrees of freedom are certainly not just weakly interacting partons.\n\n4.2\n\nChiral symmetry restoration\n\nAs chiral symmetry restoration does not lead to a significant change of light degrees\nof freedom, it also is not expected to have an appreciable effect on bulk thermodynamic observables \u2013 apart from controlling details of the transition very close to\nTc . In particular, we expect that in the case of a continuous transition for nf = 2,\nthe chiral order parameter and its derivative, the chiral susceptibility, show critical\nbehaviour which is characteristic for O(4) spin models in three dimensions [12]. The\nexpected critical behaviour follows from standard scaling arguments derived from\nthe singular part of the free energy density,\nfs (t, h) \u2261 \u2212\n\nT\nln Zs = b\u2212d fs (byt t, byh h)\nV\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\n\f14\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\nwhere t = (T \u2212Tc )/Tc \u223c (\u03b2 \u2212\u03b2c ) is the reduced temperature, h = m/T \u223c mq N\u03c4 the\nscaled quark mass and b is an arbitrary scale factor. For the chiral order parameter,\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i, and the chiral susceptibility, \u03c7m , one finds from Eq. 23,\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i = h1/\u03b4 F (z)\n\u03c7m (t, h) =\n\n(24)\n\n\u0014\n\n1 1/\u03b4\u22121\nz\nh\nF (z) \u2212 F \u2032 (z)\n\u03b4\n\u03b2\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nwith scaling functions F and F \u2032 that only depend on a specific combination of the\nreduced temperature and scaled quark mass, z = th\u22121/\u03b2\u03b4 .

As\nthe t-dependence enters in \u03c7m (t, h) only through z one also deduces that the line of\npseudo-critical couplings defined through the location of the maximum of \u03c7m (t, h)\nat fixed h is described by a universal scaling function,\ntc (h) \u2261 zc h1/\u03b2\u03b4\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nAlthough there is ample evidence that the phase transition in 2-flavour QCD is continuous in the chiral limit, the evidence for the expected O(4) scaling is, at present,\nambiguous. The behaviour of the pseudo-critical couplings is, in general, consistent\nwith the expected scaling behaviour. The information on the magnetic equation of\nstate, Eq. 24, however, seems to depend on the fermion discretization scheme used\nto analyze the critical behaviour. While calculations with Wilson fermions yield\nalmost perfect agreement with the universal form of the O(4) magnetic equation of\nstate [22], significant deviations have been found in the case of staggered fermions\n[23]. The failure of the scaling analysis in the case of staggered fermions is surprising\nas this staggered fermion action has a global O(2) symmetry even for finite values\nof the lattice cut-off and as the O(4) and O(2) magnetic equations of state are quite\nsimilar [24]. this suggests that finite size effects still play an important role, which\nis supported by a recent finite size scaling analysis [25]. In Fig. 6 we show the finite\nsize scaling behaviour of the chiral condensate, which has been reanalyzed in [25].\nIt is consistent with O(4) (or O(2)) scaling behaviour. This aspect, however, clearly\nneeds further studies.\nThe changes of the chiral condensate below Tc and chiral symmetry restoration at Tc will have a strong influence on the light hadron spectrum. At Tc the\npseudo-scalar mesons (pions) will no longer be Goldstone particles, they turn into\nmassive modes (quasi-particle excitations?) above Tc . Long distance correlations of\nthe chiral condensate decay exponentially with a characteristic length scale proportional to the inverse scalar meson mass. A diverging chiral susceptibility at Tc thus\nindicates that the scalar meson mass vanishes at Tc . The mass splitting between\nparity partners thus will decrease when the symmetry breaking reduces and finally\nwill become degenerate at Tc .\nAs indicated above the modifications of the hadron spectrum are reflected by\nthe temperature dependence of appropriately chosen susceptibilities, which are the\nspace-time integral over hadronic correlation functions in a given quantum number\nchannel,\n\u03c7H =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1/T\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nd3 r GH (\u03c4, r)\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n15\n\n2.0\n1.5\n\nL\n\n/\n\n<\n\n>\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nmqaL1/\n1\n\n10\n\n50\n\nc\n\n100\n\nFig. 6.

In particular, we note that the chiral susceptibility, \u03c7m ,\ndefined in Eq. 21 is the susceptibility of the scalar correlation function. These susceptibilities define generalized masses, m\u22122\nH \u2261 \u03c7H , which are shown in Fig. 7. They,\nindeed, show the expected behaviour; scalar (f0 ) and pseudo-scalar (\u03c0) partners become degenerate at Tc whereas the vector meson (\u03b4) which is related to the scalar\nmeson through a UA (1) rotation only gradually approaches the other masses. The\naxial UA (1) symmetry thus remains broken at Tc .\n\n5\n\nScreening at High Temperature \u2013 Short versus Long\nDistance Physics\n\nOur picture of the thermodynamics in the high temperature phase of QCD largely\nis influenced by perturbative concepts \u2013 asymptotic freedom and the screening of\nelectric and magnetic components of the gluon fields.

Shown are results from calculations in 2-flavour QCD\nperformed on lattices of size 83 \u00d7 4 with staggered fermions of mass mq = 0.02.\nthat the temperature dependent running coupling, g(T ), becomes small at high\ntemperatures and eventually vanishes in the limit T \u2192 \u221e. This in turn will lead\nto a separation of the thermal length scale, 1/T , from the electric, 1/g(T )T , and\nmagnetic, 1/g 2 (T )T , screening length scales. The experience gained from lattice\ncalculations in the pure SU (3) gauge theory, however, suggests that this separation\nof scales, unfortunately, will set in only at asymptotically large temperatures. For\nall interesting temperatures reachable in heavy ion experiments or even covering\nthe temperature interval between the strong and electroweak phase transitions that\noccurred in the early universe, the coupling g(T ) is of O(1) and, moreover, the Debye\nscreening mass is significantly larger than the leading order perturbative value,\nnf\ng(T ) T .\n(29)\n6\nIn fact, for Tc <\n\u223cT <\n\u223c100 Tc one finds that mD is still about three times larger than\nthis leading order value [26]. A consequence of this large value of the screening mass\nis that also short distance properties of the plasma are strongly influenced by nonperturbative screening effects; the Debye screening length, rD \u2261 1/mD , becomes\ncompatible with the characteristic length scale rSB in a free gas where the main\ncontribution to the Stefan-Boltzmann law originates from particle with momenta\np \u223c 3T , i.e. rSB \u223c 1/3T , and is of the same order as the mean separation between partons in a quark-gluon plasma. We thus must expect that non-perturbative\nscreening effects also have an influence on bulk thermodynamics properties (pressure, energy density) above Tc and even up to quite large temperatures. In fact, the\ncalculations of the pressure and energy density in the SU (3) gauge theory and in\nQCD with light quarks, which we are going to discuss in the next section, show that\nat temperatures a few times Tc deviations from the ideal gas limit are still too large\nmD =\n\nq\n\n1+\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n17\n\nto be understood in terms of conventional high temperature perturbation theory,\nwhich converges badly at these temperatures just because of the large contribution\narising from Debye screening [30].\nThe screening of static quark and anti-quark sources is commonly analyzed in\nterms of Polyakov-loop correlation functions, which define the heavy quark free\nenergy introduced in Eq. 15. The leading perturbative contribution to Fq\u0304q (r, T )\nresults from the exchange of two gluons,\n\u221e\nFq\u0304q (r, T ) \u2212 Fq\u0304q\nhTrLx TrL\u2020y i\nVq\u0304q (r, T )\n\u2261\n= \u2212 ln\nT\nT\n|hLi|2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n=\u2212\n16\n\n\u0012\n\ng 2 (T ) 1\n3\u03c0 rT\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00132\n\n+ O(g 5 )\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nHigher order contributions will lead to screening of this powerlike large distance\nbehaviour, 1/rT \u2192 exp (\u2212mD r)/rT , and also result in an exponentiation of the\nleading order contribution. We then may split Fq\u0304q in contributions arising from\nquark anti-quark pairs in singlet (F1 ) and octet (F8 ) configurations [3],\ne\u2212Fq\u0304q (r,T )/T =\n\n1 \u2212F1 (r,T )/T\n8\ne\n+ e\u2212F8 (r,T )/T\n9\n9\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nIn accordance with zero temperature perturbation theory the singlet free energy\nis attractive whereas the octet free energy is repulsive. Their relative strength is\nsuch that it leads to a cancellation of the leading O(g 2 ) contributions to the colour\naveraged heavy quark free energy Fq\u0304q . From Eq. 31 it is, however, apparent, that\nthe cancellation of singlet and octet contributions only occurs at large distances.

As can be seen\nthe change from the Coulomb-like behaviour at short distances to the exponential\nscreening at large distances can be well localized. For Tc \u2264 T <\n\u223c2Tc it occurs already\nfor rT \u2243 0.2 or r \u2243 0.15 (Tc /T ) fm and shifts slightly to smaller rT with increasing\ntemperature. A consequence of this efficient screening at short distances is that\neven heavy quark bound states get destroyed close to Tc in the plasma phase (J/\u03c8suppression [28]).\nThe perturbative analysis of the heavy quark free energy also suggests that for\nfixed rT the only temperature dependence of V (r, T )/T arises from the running of\nthe coupling g(T ). The rapid change of V (r, T )/T at fixed rT which is apparent\nin Fig. 8 thus also suggests that for temperatures T <\n\u223c3Tc the coupling g(T ) varies\nmuch more rapidly than the asymptotically expected logarithmic running with T .\nWe thus conclude that non-perturbative screening effects are important for the\nthermodynamics in the plasma phase also for short distance observables which are\nsensitive to the physics at distances r >\n\u223c1/5T .

Deviations from this ideal gas values have been studied\nin high temperature perturbation theory. However, it was well-known that this expansion is no longer calculable perturbatively at O(g 6 ) [29]. By now all calculable\norders up to O(g 5 ln g) have been calculated [30]. Unfortunately it turned out that\nthe information gained from this expansion is rather limited. The expansion shows\nbad convergence behaviour and suggests that it is of use only at temperatures several orders of magnitude larger than the QCD transition temperature. In analytic\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n19\n\napproaches one thus has to go beyond perturbation theory which currently is being attempted by either using hard thermal loop resummation techniques [31,32]\nor perturbative dimensional reduction combined with numerical simulations of the\nresulting effective 3-dimensional theory [33].\nIn order to make use of the basic thermodynamic relations, Eqs. 33 and 34,\nin numerical calculations on the lattice we have to go through an additional intermediate step. The free energy density itself is not directly accessible in Monte\nCarlo calculations; e.g. only expectation values can be calculated easily. One thus\nproceeds by calculating differences of the free energy density at two different temperatures. These are obtained by taking a suitable derivative of ln Z followed by an\nintegration, e.g.\nf\nT4\n\nT\n\nTo\n\n= \u2212\n\n1\nV\n\nZ\n\nT\n\ndx\n\nTo\n\n\u2202x\u22123 ln Z(x, V )\n\u2202x\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nThis ansatz readily translates to the lattice.

The lower integration limit is chosen at low temperatures\nso that f /To4 is small and may be ignored7 .\nA little bit more involved is the calculation of the energy density as we have\nto take derivatives with respect to the temperature, T = 1/N\u03c4 a. On lattices with\nfixed temporal extent N\u03c4 we rewrite this in terms of a derivative with respect to\nthe lattice spacing a which in turn is controlled through the bare couplings of the\nQCD Lagrangian, a \u2261 a(\u03b2, mq ).

Even the lightest ones calculated on the lattice have large masses,\nmG \u2243 1.5 GeV. The free energy density thus is exponentially suppressed already\nclose to Tc . In QCD with light quarks the dominant contribution to the free\nenergy density comes from pions. As long as we are dealing with massive quarks\nalso this contribution gets suppressed exponentially. However, in the massless\nlimit clearly some care has to be taken with the normalization of the free energy\ndensity.\n\n\f20\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\ndmq (a)\nd ln a\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nh\u03c7\u0304\u03c7i \u2212 h\u03c7\u0304\u03c7iT =0\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(38)\n\nAn evaluation of the energy density thus e.g. requires the knowledge of two \u03b2functions. These may be determined by calculating two physical observables in\nlattice units for given values of \u03b2 and mq ; for instance, the string tension, \u03c3a2 and\na ratio of hadron masses, mP S /mV \u2261 m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 . These quantities will have to be\ncalculated at zero temperature which then also allows to determine a temperature\nscale in physical units as given in Eq. 12. This forms the basis for a calculation of\nthe pressure as shown already in Fig. 5.\nThe numerical calculation of thermodynamic quantities is done on finite lattices\nwith spatial extent N\u03c3 and temporal extent N\u03c4 . In order to perform calculations\nclose to the thermodynamic limit we want to use a large spatial extent of the\nlattice. In general it has been found that lattices with N\u03c3 >\n\u223c4N\u03c4 provide a good\napproximation to the infinite volume limit. In addition, we want to get close to the\ncontinuum limit in order to eliminate discretization errors. Taking the continuum\nlimit at fixed temperature requires to perform the limit N\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. In order to perform this limit in a controlled way we have to analyze in how far lattice calculations\nof bulk thermodynamic observables are influenced by the introduction of a finite\nlattice cut-off, i.e. we have to understand the systematic cut-off effects introduced\nthrough the non-zero lattice spacing. These cut-off effects are largest in the high\n(infinite) temperature limit which can be analyzed analytically in weak coupling\nlattice perturbation theory. We thus will discuss this limiting case first.\n\n6.1\n\nHigh temperature limit of the QCD equation of state\n\nIn the high temperature limit bulk thermodynamic observables are expected to\napproach their free gas values (Stefan-Boltzmann constants). In this limit cut-off\neffects in the pressure and in turn also in the energy density (\u01ebSB = 3 pSB ) become most significant. Momenta of the order of the temperature, i.e. short distance\nproperties, dominate the ideal gas behaviour.\nAs discussed in Section 2 the most straightforward lattice representation of\nthe QCD partition function in terms of the standard Wilson gauge and fermion\nactions as well as the staggered fermion action leads to a systematic O(a2 ) cut-off\ndependence of physical observables. At finite temperature the temperature itself\nsets the scale for these O(a2 ) effects, which thus give rise to O((aT )2 \u2261 1/N\u03c42 )\ndeviations of e.g. the pressure from the continuum Stefan-Boltzmann value,\np\nT4\n\n=\nN\u03c4\n\np\nT4\n\n+\n\u221e\n\nc\n+ O(N\u03c4\u22124 )\nN\u03c42\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nOne can eliminate these leading order cut-off effects by using improved actions\nwhich greatly reduces the cut-off dependence in the ideal gas limit. In the Appendix\nwe discuss a specific set of improved gauge and fermion actions.

The absolute magnitude of the cut-off\neffects, however, is smaller by about a factor of two. This, of course, is reassuring\nfor the numerical calculations performed with light quarks, where such a detailed\nsystematic study of the cut-off dependence at present does not exist.\n\n6.2\n\nThermodynamics of the SU(3) gauge theory\n\nBefore entering a discussion of bulk thermodynamics in two and three flavour QCD\nit is worthwhile to discuss some results on the equation of state in the heavy quark\nmass limit of QCD \u2013 the SU(3) gauge theory. In this case the temperature dependence of the pressure and energy density has been studied in great detail, calculations with the standard action [36] and various improved actions [37,38,39]\nhave been performed, the cut-off dependence has explicitly been analyzed through\ncalculations on lattices with varying temporal extent N\u03c4 and results have been extrapolated to the continuum limit. In Fig. 10 we show some results for the pressure\nobtained from such detailed analyzes with different actions [36,38,39]. This figure\nshows the basic features of the temperature dependence of bulk thermodynamic\nquantities in QCD, which also carry over to the case of QCD with light quarks.\nThe pressure stays small for almost all temperatures below Tc ; this is expected, as\nthe only degrees of freedom in the low temperature phase are glueballs which are\nrather heavy and thus lead to an exponential suppression of pressure and energy\ndensity at low temperature. Above Tc the pressure rises rapidly and reaches about\n70% of the asymptotic ideal gas value at T = 2 Tc . For even larger temperatures\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n23\n\nFig. 11. Energy density, entropy density and pressure of the SU(3) gauge theory\ncalculated on lattices with different temporal extent and extrapolated to the continuum limit. The dashed band indicates the size of the latent heat gap in energy\nand entropy density\n\nthe approach to this limiting value proceeds rather slowly. In fact, even at T \u2243 4 Tc\ndeviations from the ideal gas value are larger than 10%. This is too much to be\nunderstood in terms of weakly interacting gluons as they are described by ordinary high temperature perturbation theory [30]. Even at these high temperatures\nnon-perturbative effects have to be taken into account which may be described in\nterms of interactions among quasi-particles [31,40]. In Fig. 10 we show the result\nof a self-consistent HTL resummation [41], which leads to good agreement with\nthe lattice calculations for T >\n\u223c3Tc . Other approaches [33,40] reach a similarly good\nagreement in the high temperature regime.\nCompared to the pressure the energy density rises much more rapidly in the\nvicinity of Tc . In fact, as the transition is first order in the SU (3) gauge theory\nthe energy density is discontinuous at Tc with a latent heat of about 1.5Tc4 [42].\nIn Fig. 11 we show results for the energy density, entropy density and the pressure\nobtained from calculations with the Wilson action which have been extrapolated\nto the continuum limit [36]. The delayed rise of the pressure compared to that of\nthe energy density has consequences for the velocity of sound in the QCD plasma\nin the vicinity of Tc . It is substantially smaller than in the high temperature ideal\ngas limit.\n\n6.3\n\nFlavour dependence of the QCD equation of state\n\nAs shown in Eq. 36 the pressure in QCD with light quarks can be calculated along\nthe same line as in the pure gauge sector.

The dashed band estimates the results in the continuum limit as described in the text. The horizontal\nlines to the right and left show the Stefan-Boltzmann values for an ideal pion gas\nand a free quark-gluon gas, respectively.\n\nwill be difficult to perform calculations on lattices with large temporal extent. In\nfact, at present all calculations of the equation of state are restricted to lattices\nwith N\u03c4 = 4 and 6 [21,43,44]. The use of an improved fermion action thus seems to\nbe even more important in this case. Of course, an additional problem arises from\ninsufficient chiral properties of staggered and Wilson fermion actions. This will\nmainly be of importance in the low temperature phase and in the vicinity of the\ntransition temperature. The continuum extrapolation thus will be more involved in\nthe case of QCD with light quarks than in the pure gauge theory and we will have\nto perform calculations closer to the continuum limit. Nonetheless, in particular for\nsmall number of flavours, we may expect that the flavour symmetry breaking only\nhas a small effect on the overall magnitude of bulk thermodynamic observables.\nAfter all, for nf = 2, the pressure of an ideal massless pion gas contributes less\nthan 10% of that of an ideal quark-gluon gas in the high temperature limit. For our\ndiscussion of bulk thermodynamic observables the main source for lattice artifacts\nthus still seems to arise from the short distance cut-off effects, which we have to\ncontrol. Additional confidence in the numerical results can be gained by comparing\nsimulations performed with different fermion actions.\nThe importance of an improved lattice action, which leads to small cut-off errors\nat least in the high temperature ideal gas limit is apparent from Fig. 12, where we\ncompare the results of a calculation of the pressure in 2-flavour QCD performed with\nunimproved gauge and staggered fermion actions [43] and the RG-improved gauge\nand clover improved Wilson action [44] with results obtained with the p4-action discussed in the Appendix. At temperatures above T \u2243 2 Tc these actions qualitatively\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n25\n\nreproduce the cut-off effects calculated analytically in the infinite temperature limit\n(see Section 6.1). In particular, it is evident that also the Clover improved Wilson\naction leads to an overshooting of the continuum ideal gas limit. This is expected\nas the Clover term in the Wilson action does eliminate O(ag 2 ) cut-off effects but\ndoes not improve the high temperature ideal gas limit, which is O(g 0 ). The clover\nimproved Wilson action thus leads to the same large O(a2 ) cut-off effects as the\nunimproved Wilson action. The influence of cut-off effects in bulk thermodynamic\nobservables thus is similar in calculations with light quarks and in the SU (3) gauge\ntheory. This observation may also help to estimate the cut-off effects still present\nin current calculations with light quarks. In particular, we know from the analysis\nperformed in the pure gauge sector that in the interesting temperature regime of a\nfew times Tc the cut-off dependence seems to be about a factor two smaller than\ncalculated analytically in the infinite temperature limit; we may expect that this\ncarries over to the case of QCD with light quarks. This is the basis for the estimated\ncontinuum extrapolation of the nf = 2 results shown as a dashed band in Fig. 12.\nIn Fig. 5 we have already shown result for the pressure calculated in QCD with\ndifferent number of flavours. This figure clearly shows that the transition region\nshifts to smaller temperatures as the number of degrees of freedom is increased.\nSuch a conclusion, of course, requires the determination of a temperature scale that\nis common to all QCD-like theories which have a particle content different from that\nrealized in nature. We have determined this temperature scale by assuming that the\nstring tension is flavour and quark mass independent. This assumption is supported\nby the observation that already in the heavy quark mass limit the string tension\n\u221a\ncalculated in units of quenched hadron masses, e.g. m\u03c1 / \u03c3 =\u221a1.81 (4) [45], is in\ngood agreement with values required in QCD phenomenology, \u03c3 \u2243 425 MeV.\nAt high temperature the magnitude of p/T 4 clearly reflects the change in the\nnumber of light degrees of freedom present in the ideal gas limit. When we rescale\nthe pressure by the corresponding ideal gas values it becomes, however, apparent\nthat the overall pattern of the temperature dependence of p/T 4 is quite similar in\nall cases. This is shown in Fig. 13. In particular, when one takes into account that\na proper continuum extrapolation in QCD with light quarks is still missing this\nagreement achieved with improved staggered fermions is quite remarkable.\nWe also note that the pressure at low temperature is enhanced in QCD with light\nquarks compared to the pure gauge case. This is an indication for the contribution\nof hadronic states, which are significantly lighter than the heavy glueballs of the\nSU (3) gauge theory. This behaviour is even more clearly visible in the behaviour\nof the energy density which is shown in Fig. 14, where we show results obtained\nwith improved staggered9 and Wilson [44] fermions. We note that these calculations\nyield consistent estimates for the energy density at Tc ,\n\u01ebc \u2243 (6 \u00b1 2)Tc4\n\n.\n\n(42)\n\nThis estimate for \u01ebc /Tc4 , which also is consistent with results obtained from\ncalculations with a standard staggered fermion action [43], is an order of magnitude\nlarger than the critical value on the hadronic side of the transition in the pure gauge\ntheory (see Fig. 11). It is, however, interesting to note that when we convert this\n9\n\nThe figure for staggered fermions is based on data from Ref. [21]. Here a contribution to \u01eb/T 4 which is proportional to the bare quark mass and vanishes in the\nchiral limit is not taken into account.\n\n\f26\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n1.0\n0.8\n\np/pSB\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n3 flavour\n2 flavour\n2+1 flavour\n\n0.2\n\npure gauge\nT/Tc\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nFig. 13. The pressure in units of the ideal gas pressure for the SU (3) gauge theory\nand QCD with various number of flavours. The latter calculations have been performed on lattices with temporal extent N\u03c4 = 4 using the p4-action defined in the\nAppendix. Results are not yet extrapolated to the continuum limit.\nresult for \u01ebc in physical units, [MeV/fm3 ], this difference gets to a large extent\ncompensated by the shift in Tc to smaller values. When going from the infinite\nquark mass limit to the light quark mass regime the QCD transition thus seems\nto take place at compatible values of the energy density, \u01ebc \u2243 (0.5 \u2212 1)GeV/fm3 .\nThe largest uncertainty on this number at present arises from uncertainties on the\nvalue of Tc (see next section). However, also the magnitude of \u01ebc /Tc4 still has to be\ndetermined more accurately. Here two competing effects will be relevant. On the\none hand we expect \u01ebc /Tc4 to increase with decreasing quark masses, i.e. closer to\nthe chiral limit. On the other hand, it is likely that finite volume effects are similar\nto those in the pure gauge sector, which suggests that \u01ebc /Tc4 will still decrease closer\nto the thermodynamic limit, i.e. for N\u03c3 \u2192 \u221e.\nIn the 2-flavour calculations performed with improved Wilson fermions [44] the\npressure and energy density have been calculated for several values of the quark\nmass, which corresponds to different ratios of the pseudo-scalar to vector meson\nmass mP S /mV . The results show no significant quark mass dependence up to\nmP S /mV \u2243 0.9. This meson mass ratio corresponds to pseudo-scalar meson masses\nof about 1.5 GeV, which is somewhat larger than the \u03a6-meson mass. This suggests\nthat the corresponding quark mass is compatible with that of the strange quark.\nThe approximate quark mass independence of the equation of state observed in the\nhigh temperature phase thus is consistent with our expectation that quark mass\neffects should become significant only when the quark masses get larger than the\ntemperature.\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n27\n\n16.0\n14.0\n\n\u03b5SB/T4\n\n\u03b5/T4\n\n12.0\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n\n3 flavour\n2+1 flavour\n2 flavour\n\n4.0\n2.0\n\nT/Tc\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nSB Nt=4\n\n25.0\n\n20.0\n\n\u03b5/T\n\n4\n\nSB Nt=6\n15.0\nSB continuum\nmPS/mV=0.65\nmPS/mV=0.70\nmPS/mV=0.75\nmPS/mV=0.80\nmPS/mV=0.85\nmPS/mV=0.90\nmPS/mV=0.95\n\n10.0\n\n5.0\n\n0.0\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nT/Tpc\nFig. 14.

The upper (lower) figure shows results from\na calculation with improved staggered [21] (Wilson [44]) fermions on lattices with\ntemporal extent N\u03c4 = 4 (N\u03c4 = 4, 6). The staggered fermion calculations have been\nperformed for a pseudo-scalar to vector meson mass ratio of mP S /mV = 0.7.\n\n7\n\nThe Critical Temperature of the QCD Transition\n\nAs discussed in Section 3 the transition to the high temperature phase is continuous\nand non-singular for a large range of quark masses. Nonetheless, for all quark masses\nthis transition proceeds rather rapidly in a small temperature interval. A definite\ntransition point thus can be identified, for instance through the location of peaks in\nthe susceptibilities of the Polyakov loop or the chiral condensate defined in Eq. 21.\nFor a given value of the quark mass one thus determines pseudo-critical couplings,\n\u03b2pc (mq ), on a lattice with temporal extent N\u03c4 . An additional calculation of an\nexperimentally or phenomenologically known observable at zero temperature, e.g.\n\n\f28\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\na hadron mass or the string tension, is still needed to determine the transition\ntemperature from Eq. 12. In the pure gauge theory the transition temperature,\nagain has been analyzed in great detail and the influence of cut-off effects has been\nexamined through calculations on different size lattices and with different actions.\nFrom this one finds for the critical temperature of the first order phase transition\nin the pure SU (3) gauge theory,\n\u221a\nSU(3) gauge theory : Tc / \u03c3 = 0.637 \u00b1 0.005\nTc = (271 \u00b1 2) MeV\n\n(43)\n\nAlready the early calculations for the transition temperature with light quarks\n[46,47] indicated that the inclusion of light quarks leads to a significant decrease\nof the transition temperature. However, these early calculations, which have been\nperformed with standard Wilson [46] and staggered [47] fermion actions, also led to\nsignificant discrepancies in the results for Tc as well as the order of the transition.\nThese differences strongly diminished in the newer calculations which are based\non improved Wilson fermions (Clover action) [47,48,49], domain wall fermions [50]\nas well as improved staggered fermions (p4-action) [19]. A compilation of these\nnewer results is shown in Fig. 15 for various values of the quark masses. In order\nto compare calculations performed with different actions the results are presented\nin terms of a physical observable, the meson mass ratio mP S /mV . In Fig. 15a we\nshow Tc /mV obtained for 2-flavour QCD while Fig. 15b gives a comparison of\nresults obtained with improved staggered fermions [19] for 2 and 3-flavour QCD.\nAlso shown there is a result for the case of (2+1)-flavour QCD, i.e. for two light\nand one heavier quark flavour degree of freedom. Unfortunately the quark masses\nin this latter case are still too large to be compared directly with the situation\nrealized in nature. We note however, that the results obtained so far suggest that\nthe transition temperature in (2+1)-flavour QCD is close to that of 2-flavour QCD.\nThe 3-flavour theory, on the other hand, leads to consistently smaller values of the\ncritical temperature, Tc (nf = 2) \u2212 Tc (nf = 3) \u2243 20 MeV. The extrapolation of the\ntransition temperatures to the chiral limit gave\n\n2 \u2212 flavour QCD : Tc =\n3 \u2212 flavour QCD : Tc =\n\n\uf8f1\n(171 \u00b1 4) MeV, clover-improved Wilson\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nfermions [48]\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (173 \u00b1 8) MeV, improved staggered\n(154 \u00b1 8) MeV,\n\nfermions [19]\nimproved staggered\n\nfermions [19]\n\nHere m\u03c1 has been used to set the scale for Tc . Although the agreement between\nresults obtained with Wilson and staggered fermions is striking, one should bear in\nmind that all these results have been obtained on lattice with temporal extent N\u03c4 =\n4, i.e. at rather large lattice spacing, a \u2243 0.3 fm. Moreover, there are uncertainties\ninvolved in the ansatz used to extrapolate to the chiral limit. We thus estimate\nthat the systematic error on the value of Tc /m\u03c1 still is of similar magnitude as the\npurely statistical error quoted above.\nWe note from Fig. 15 that Tc /mV drops with increasing ratio mP S /mV , i.e.\nwith increasing quark mass. This may not be too surprising as mV , of course,\ndoes not take on the physical \u03c1-meson mass value as long as mP S /mV did not\nreach is physical value (vertical line in Fig. 15a).

All results are from simulations on lattices\nwith temporal extent N\u03c4 = 4.

Fig. 15 thus does not yet allow to quantify how Tc depends on\nthe quark mass. A simple percolation picture for the QCD transition would suggest\nthat Tc (mq ) or better Tc (mP S ) will increase with increasing mq ; with increasing\nmq also the hadron masses increase and it becomes more difficult to excite the low\nlying hadronic states. It thus becomes more difficult to create a sufficiently high\n\n\f30\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n0.65\n\nTc/\u221a\u03c3\n\n0.60\n0.55\n0.50\nnf=2, p4\nnf=3, p4\nnf=2, std\n\n0.45\n0.40\n\nmPS / \u221a\u03c3\n\n0.35\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n9.0\n\nFig. 16.

The straight line is the fit given in Eq. 45.\nparticle/energy density in the hadronic phase that can trigger a phase (percolation)\ntransition. Such a picture also follows from chiral model calculations [51].\nAs argued previously we should express Tc in units of an observable, which itself\nis not dependent on mq ; the string tension (or also a quenched hadron mass) seems\nto be suitable for this purpose. In fact, this is what tacitly has been assumed when\n\u221a\none converts the critical temperature of the SU(3) gauge theory Tc / \u03c3 \u2243 0.63 into\nphysical units as has also been done in Eq. 43.\nTo quantify the quark mass dependence of the transition temperature one may\n\u221a\n\u221a\nexpress Tc in units of \u03c3. This ratio is shown in Fig. 16 as a function of mP S / \u03c3.

However, this clearly cannot be the origin of the quasi linear behaviour which\nis observed for rather large hadron masses and seems to be independent of nf .\nMoreover, unlike in chiral models [51] the dependence of Tc on mP S turns out to\nbe rather weak. The line shown in Fig. 16 is a fit to the 3-flavour data, which gave\n\n\u0012\n\nTc\n\u221a\n\u03c3\n\n\u0013\n\n\u221a\nmP S / \u03c3\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nTc\n\u221a\n\u03c3\n\n\u0013\n\n0\n\n+ 0.04(1)\n\n\u0012\n\nmP S\n\u221a\n\u03c3\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(45)\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n31\n\nIt thus seems that the transition temperature does not react strongly on changes\nof the lightest hadron masses. This favours the interpretation that the contributions\nof heavy resonance masses are equally important for the occurrence of the transition.\nIn fact, this also can explain why the transition still sets in at quite low temperatures\neven when all hadron masses, including the pseudo-scalars, attain masses of the\norder of 1 GeV or more. Such an interpretation also is consistent with the weak\nquark mass dependence of the critical energy density we found from the analysis of\nthe QCD equation of state in the previous section.\nFor the quark masses currently used in lattice calculations a resonance gas model\ncombined with a percolation criterion thus provides an appropriate to describe the\nthermodynamics close to Tc . It remains to be seen whether the role of the light\nmeson sector becomes more dominant when we get closer to the chiral limit.\n\n8\n\nFinite Density QCD\n\nFinite density calculations in QCD are affected by the well known sign problem, i.e.\nthe fermion determinant appearing in the QCD partition function, Eq. 11, becomes\ncomplex for non-zero values of the chemical potential \u03bc and thus prohibits the use\nof conventional numerical algorithms.

A reformulation of the original ansatz may lead to a representation of\nthe partition function which, in the ideal case, would require the averaging over\nconfigurations with strictly positive weights only, or at least would lead to a strong\nreduction of configurations with negative weights.\nAn alternative formulation of finite density QCD is given in terms of canonical\nrather than grand canonical partition functions [53], i.e. rather than introducing\na non-zero chemical potential through which the number density is controlled one\nintroduces directly a non-zero baryon number (or quark number B) through Eq. 47\nfrom which the baryon number density on lattices of size N\u03c33 \u00d7 N\u03c4 is obtained as\nnB /T 3 = B3 (N\u03c4 /N\u03c3 )3 . Also this formulation is by no means easy to use in general,\ni.e. for QCD with light quarks. In particular, it also still suffers from a sign problem.\nIt, however, leads to a quite natural and useful formulation of the quenched limit of\nQCD at non-zero density [54] which may be a good starting point for generalizing\nthis approach to finite values of the quark mass. In the following we briefly outline\nthe basic ideas of this approach.\n\n8.1\n\nQuenched limit of finite density QCD\n\nIt had been noticed early that the straightforward replacement of the fermion determinant by a constant does not lead to a meaningful static limit of QCD [58]. In\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n33\n\nfact, this simple replacement corresponds to the static limit fermion flavours carrying baryon number B and \u2212B, respectively [59]. This should not be too surprising.\nWhen one starts with QCD at a non-zero baryon number and takes the limit of\ninfinitely heavy quarks something should be left over from the determinant that\nrepresents the objects that carry the baryon number. In the canonical formulation\nthis becomes obvious. For mq \u2192 \u221e one ends up with a partition function, which\nfor baryon number B/3 still includes the sum over products of B Polyakov loops,\ni.e. the static quark propagators which carry the baryon number [54]. This limit\nalso has some analogy in the grand canonical formulation where the coupled limit\nmq , \u03bc \u2192 \u221e with exp (\u03bc)/2mq kept fixed has been performed [60,61]11 .\nAs the baryon number is carried by the rather heavy nucleons in the confined\nphase of QCD we may expect that it is quit reasonable to approximate them by\nstatic objects. This may already provide valuable insight into the thermodynamics\nof QCD at non-zero baryon number density already from quenched QCD.\nIn the canonical approach simulations at non-zero B can be performed on relatively large lattices and the use of baryon number densities up to a few times\nnuclear matter density is possible [54,62]. The simulations performed so far in the\nstatic limit show the basic features expected at non-zero density. As can be seen\nfrom the behaviour of the Polyakov loop expectation value shown in Fig. 17 the\ntransition region gets shifted to smaller temperatures (smaller coupling \u03b2). The\nbroadening of the transition region suggests a smooth crossover behaviour at nonzero density. However, in a canonical simulation it also may indicate the presence\nof a region of coexisting phases and thus would signal the existence of a 1st order\nphase transition. This deserves further analysis.\nEven more interesting is the behaviour of the heavy quark free energy in the\nlow temperature phase. As shown in the right frame of Fig. 17 the free energy does\nget screened at non-vanishing number density. The influence of static quark sources\non the heavy quark free energy is similar in magnitude to the screening (string\nbreaking) seen in QCD simulations at finite temperature in the low temperature\nhadronic phase (see Fig. 4). At non-zero baryon number density we thus may expect\nsimilarly strong medium effects as at finite temperature.\n\n9\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have given a brief introduction into the lattice formulation of QCD thermodynamics and presented a few of the basic results on the QCD equation of state, the\ncritical parameters for the transition to the QCD plasma phase and properties of\nthis new phase of matter.\nThe thermodynamics of the heavy quark mass limit is quite well under control;\nwe know the equation of state and the transition temperature with an accuracy\nof a few percent. We now also have reached a first quantitative understanding of\nQCD with light quarks, which at present still corresponds to a world in which the\n11\n\nThis is a well known limit in statistical physics. When deriving the non-relativistic\ngas limit from a relativistic gas of particles with mass m\u0304, the rest mass is splitted\noff from the chemical potential, \u03bc \u2261 \u03bcnr + m\u0304, in order to cancel the corresponding\nrest mass term in the particle energies. On the lattice m\u0304 = ln(2mq ) for large bare\nquark masses.\n\n\f34\n\nFrithjof Karsch\n\npion would have a mass of about (300-500) MeV. This still is too heavy to become\nsensitive to details of the physics of chiral symmetry breaking. Nonetheless, lattice\ncalculations performed with different lattice fermion formulations start to produce a\nconsistent picture for the quark mass dependence of the equation of state as well as\nthe influence of the number of light flavours on the phase transition and they yield\ncompatible results for the transition temperature. In these calculations we learn to\ncontrol the systematic errors inherent to lattice calculations performed with a finite\nlattice cut-off and start getting control over the effects resulting from the explicit\nbreaking of continuum symmetries in the fermion sector. With these experience at\nhand we soon will be able to study the thermodynamics of QCD with a realistic\nspectrum of light up and down quarks and a heavier strange quark.\n\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank the organizers of the 40th Schladming Winter School on\n\"Dense Matter\" for arranging a very stimulating topical meeting. Furthermore, I\nwould like to thank all my colleagues in Bielefeld, in particular J\u00fcrgen Engels,\nEdwin Laermann, Bengt Petersson and Helmut Satz, for the extremely fruitful\ncollaboration I had with them for many years on most of the topics discussed in\nthese lectures.\n\nAppendix: Improved Gauge and Fermion Actions\nImproved gauge actions\nWhen formulating a discretized version of QCD one has a great deal of freedom in\nchoosing a lattice action. Different formulations may differ by sub-leading powers\nof the lattice cut-off, which vanish in the continuum limit. This has, for instance,\nbeen used by Symanzik to systematically improve scalar field theories [63] and has\nthen been applied to lattice regularized SU (N ) gauge theories [64,65]. In addition\nto the elementary plaquette term appearing in the standard Wilson formulation of\nlattice QCD larger loops can be added to the action in such a way that the leading\nO(a2 g 0 ) deviations from the continuum formulation are eliminated and corrections\nonly start in O(a4 g 0 , a2 g 2 ). A simple class of improved actions is, for instance,\nobtained by adding planar loops of size (k, l) to the standard Wilson action (oneplaquette action) [34]. The simplest extension of the Wilson one-plaquette action\nthus is to include an additional contribution from a planar six-link Wilson loop,\n(1,2)\nWn,\u03bc\u03bd\n=1\u2212\n\n1\nRe\n6\n\n\u0012\n\n+\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(51)\n\nn,\u03bc\u03bd\n\nCombining this six-link contribution with the four-link plaquette term in a suitable\nway one can eliminate the leading O(a2 ) corrections and arrives at a formulation\nthat reproduces the continuum action up to O(a4 ) corrections at least on the classical level at O(g 0 ),\n\u03b2SG = \u03b2\n\nX\n\nn\n0\u2264\u03bc<\u03bd\u22643\n\n(1,1)\n(1,2)\nc1,1 Wn,\u03bc\u03bd\n+ c1,2 Wn,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(52)\n\n\fLattice QCD at High Temperature and Density\n\n35\n\nwith c1,1 = 5/3 and c1,2 = \u22121/6. We call this action the tree-level improved\n(1\u00d72)-action. It may be further improved perturbatively by eliminating the leading\n(0)\n(1)\nlattice cut-off effects also at O(g 2 ), i.e. ci,j \u21d2 ci,j + g 2 ci,j , or by introducing\nnon-perturbative modifications. A well-studied gluon action with non-perturbative\ncorrections is the RG-improved action introduced by Y. Iwasaki [66]. This RGaction also has the structure of Eq. 52 but with coefficients cRG\n1,1 = 3.648 and\n2\ncRG\n1,2 = \u22120.662. Of course, this action will still lead to O(a ) corrections in the ideal\ngas limit. The N\u03c4 -dependence of cut-off effects resulting from these actions is shown\nin Fig. 9. In Section 6 we also show some results from calculations with a tadpole\nimproved actions [67]. This non-perturbative improvement amounts to ctad\n1,1 \u2261 c1,1\n2\nand a replacement of c1,2 by ctad\n1,2 = 1/6u0 (\u03b2) where,\nu40 =\n\n1\n6N\u03c33 N\u03c4\n\nh\n\nX\n\n1,1\n(1 \u2212 W\u03bc,\u03bd\n(x)) i\n\n.\n\n(53)\n\nx,\u03bd>\u03bc\n\nIn the ideal gas limit this action still has the same cut-off dependence as the treelevel improved (1 \u00d7 2) action.\nImproved staggered fermion actions\nWhen discussing the improvement of fermion actions there are at least two aspects\none has to take into account. On the one hand one faces problems with cut-off\neffects similar to the pure gauge sector; on the tree level the standard Wilson and\nKogut-Susskind discretization schemes introduce O(a2 ) which will influence the\nshort distance properties of physical observables. On the other hand also the global\nsymmetries of the continuum Lagrangian are explicitly broken at non-zero lattice\nspacing. This influences the long distance properties of these actions, e.g. the light\nparticle sector (Goldstone modes) of the lattice regularized theory. Both aspects\nare of importance for thermodynamic calculations. The latter problem certainly is\nof importance in the vicinity of the QCD phase transition while the former will\nshow up when analyzing the high temperature limit of the equation of state.\nIn the case of staggered fermions both problems have been addressed and\nschemes have been developed that lead to a reduction of cut-off effects at short\ndistances, i.e. high temperature, and also allow to reduce the explicit flavour symmetry breaking of the staggered discretization scheme.\nA particular form of improved action used in recent calculations of the Bielefeld\ngroup is a staggered fermion action, which in addition to the standard one-link term\nincludes a set of bended three-link terms,\nF\nSF (mq ) = cF\n1 S1\u2212link,f at (\u03c9) + c3 S3\u2212link + mq\n\nX\nx\n\n\u2261\n\nX\nx\n\n\u03c7\u0304fx\n\nX\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b7\u03bc (x)\n\n3\n8\n\n\"\n\n\u271b\nq\n\u275c \u2732q\ny\n\nx\n\ny\n\n+ \u03c9\n\nX\n\u03bd6=\u03bc\n\n\u03c7\u0304fx \u03c7fx\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732 #\n\u273b\u273b\n\u2744\n\u2744\nq\n\u275c\nq\ny\ny\nx\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u271b \u2744\u2744\u2732\n\n\f36\n\nFrithjof Karsch\ny\n\nq\n\u273b\n\"q\n\u273b\n1 X\n+\nq\u271b \u275c x\n96\n\n\u2744\nq\n\n\u03bd6=\u03bc\n\n\u2744\nq \u2732qy\n+mq\n\nX\n\nq\u271b q\n\u273b\nq\n\u273b\n+\nx \u275c \u2732q\ny\n\n\u03c7\u0304fx \u03c7fx\n\n.\n\ny\n\n+\n\nq\u2744\ny\n\nq\u2744\n\nx\n\nq\n\u273b\nq\n\u273b\n\u275c \u2732q + q\u271b\nq\u2744\n\ny\n\nq\u271b q\u2744\n\nq\u2744\ny\n\nq \u2732q y\n\u273b\nq\n#!\n\u273b\n\u03c7fy\n\u275cx\n\nq\u2744\n(54)\n\nx\n\nHere \u03b7\u03bc (x) \u2261 (\u22121)x0 +..+x\u03bc\u22121 denotes the staggered fermion phase factors. Furthermore, we have made explicit the dependence of the fermion action on different\nquark flavours q, and the corresponding bare quark masses mq , and give an intuitive\nF\ngraphical representation of the action. The tree level coefficients cF\n1 and c3 appearing in SF have been fixed by demanding rotational invariance of the free quark\npropagator at O(p4 ) (\"p4-action\") [69]. In addition the 1-link term of the fermion\naction has been modified by introducing \"fat\" links [68] with a weight \u03c9 = 0.2. The\nuse of fat links does lead to a reduction of the flavour symmetry breaking close to\nTc and at the same time does not modify the good features of the p4-action at high\ntemperature, i.e. it does not modify the cut-off effects at tree level and has little\ninfluence on the cut-off dependence of bulk thermodynamic observables at O(g 2 )\nin the high temperature phase [69]. Further details on the definition of the action\nare given in [69].\nWe refer to this action with a fat 1-link term combined with the tree level improved gauge action as the p4-action. The N\u03c4 -dependence of cut-off effects resulting\nfrom this action is shown in Fig. 9.\n\nReferences\n1. K.G.Wilson, Phys. Rev.
