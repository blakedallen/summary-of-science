Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic\np. Let c, d \u2208 N be such that r := c + d > 0. Let m \u2208 N\u2217 . By a BTm over a\nscheme S we mean a truncated Barsotti\u2013Tate group of level m over S which\n1\n\n\fhas codimension c and dimension d. In this paper we put forward principles\nthat govern: (i) the classification of BTm 's over k and (ii) the specializations\nof BTm 's over an algebraic closure k1 of k((x)) to BTm 's over k.\nLet D be a p-divisible group over k of codimension c and dimension d.\nIts height is r. Let nD be the i-number of D, i.e. the smallest non-negative\ninteger for which the following statement holds: if C is a p-divisible group\nover k of codimension c and dimension d and such that C[pnD ] is isomorphic\nto D[pnD ], then C is isomorphic to D. We have nD = 0 if and only if cd = 0.\nFor the existence of nD we refer to [Ma, Ch. III, Sect. 3], [Tr1, Thm. 3],\n[Tr2, Thm. 1], [Va1, Cor. 1.3], or [Oo2, Cor. 1.7]. One has a first estimate\nnD \u2264 cd + 1, cf. [Tr1, Thm. 3]. Traverso's isomorphism conjecture predicts\nthat nD \u2264 min{c, d}, cf. [Tr3, Sect. 40, Conj. 4].\nThus to classify all BTm 's over k and to decide which BTm 's over k1\nspecialize to which BTm 's over k, one is led to consider four basic problems.\nProblem 1. Determine the set Nc,d of possible values of nD .\nProblem 2. For 1 \u2264 m \u2264 max(Nc,d) classify all BTm 's over k.\nProblem 3. Find invariants that go up under specializations of BTm 's.\nProblem 4. Find basic principles that govern group actions whose orbits\nparametrize isomorphism classes of BTm 's over algebraically closed fields.\nSignificant progress toward the solution of Problem 1 was made in [Va3].\nThus in this paper we will present progress toward the solution of Problems 2\nto 4 and will provide basic tools for future extra progress toward the solution\nof Problem 1 (see already [LNV]). We begin by addressing Problem 3.\n\n1.1\n\nGroup schemes of automorphisms\n\nLet B be a BTm over k. Let Aut\nAut(B) be the group scheme over k of automorAut\nphisms of B and let \u03b3B := dim(Aut\nAut(B)). The importance of the numbers \u03b3B\nstems out from the following three main facts:\n\u2022 They are codimensions of versal level m strata, cf. [Va2, Thm. 1.2 (c)].\n\u2022 They can compute the i-numbers nD (see Theorem 1 below).\n\u2022 They are a main source of invariants that go up under specializations.\nMore precisely, we have the following elementary fact:\n(a) Let R be a local domain which is a k-subalgebra of k1 and has residue\nfield k. If B is a BTm over R that lifts B (i.e. Bk = B), then \u03b3Bk1 \u2264 \u03b3B .\n2\n\n\fBesides \u03b3B 's, we know only two other invariants that go up under specializations of BTm 's. Unfortunately, they are defined only for some specific\nvalues of m. To describe them, let j := \u2308 cd\n\u2309. It is known that j is the smallr\nest non-negative integer such that the Newton polygon of each p-divisible\ngroup C over k of codimension c and dimension d, is uniquely determined\nby the isomorphism class of C[pj ] (cf. [NV2, Thm. 1.2]). Thus if m \u2265 j, we\ncan speak about the Newton polygon \u03bdB of B: it is the Newton polygon of\nevery p-divisible group over k whose associated BTm is isomorphic to B.\n(b) We assume that m \u2265 j. Let R and B be as in (a). Then a classical\ntheorem of Grothendieck implies that \u03bdBk1 is below \u03bdB . To check this we can\nb over the\nassume that R is noetherian. There exists a p-divisible group D\nb m ] = B b , cf. [Il, Thm. 4.4 e)]. Thus the\nb of R such that D[p\ncompletion R\nR\nstatement on Newton polygons follows from [Ka, Cor. 2.3.2] applied to the\nb\nDieudonn\u00e9 F -crystal of D.\n\n(c) We assume that m = 1. Then the set of isomorphism classes of BT1 's\nover either k or k1 is in bijection to the finite quotient set Sr /(Sc \u00d7 Sd ). Thus\none can define naturally an invariant wB \u2208 Sr /(Sc \u00d7 Sd ). Moreover there\nexists a well understood relation of order 6 on Sr /(Sc \u00d7 Sd ) such that if\nR and B are as in (a), then we have wBk1 6 wB . See [We] and [PWZ] for\nall these facts (see also [Kr], [Oo1], [Mo], [MW], and [Va4]). We emphasize\nthat the invariant wB is a refinement of the classical invariants of B (like the\na-number of B, the p-rank of B, the p-rank of the Cartier dual B t of B, etc.).\nWe recall that the a-number aD of D[p] (or of D) is the greatest nonnegative integer such that \u03b1 apD is a subgroup scheme of D[p]. For i \u2208 N let\nAut\n\u03b3D (i) := dim(Aut\nAut(D[pi ])); thus \u03b3D (0) = 0. We call (\u03b3D (i))i\u2208N the centralizing\nsequence of D and we call sD := \u03b3D (nD ) the specializing height of D.\nTheorem 1 The centralizing sequence of D has the following three basic\nproperties:\n(a) For each l \u2208 N, the sequence (\u03b3D (i + l) \u2212 \u03b3D (i))i\u2208N is a decreasing\nsequence in N.\n(b) If cd > 0, then we have a2D \u2264 \u03b3D (1) < \u03b3D (2) < * * * < \u03b3D (nD ).\n(c) For i \u2265 nD we have \u03b3D (i) = \u03b3D (nD ) \u2264 cd.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 (a) relies on properties of the group scheme\nEnd\nEnd(D[pi ]) over k of endomorphisms of D[pi ] presented in Subsection 2.1\n3\n\n\f(see Subsection 2.2). The proof of Theorem 1 (b) relies on Theorem 1 (a)\nand on properties of the group actions of Section 3 (see Subsection 3.5). If\nnD > 0 (i.e. if cd > 0), then Theorem 1 (c) was proved in [Va2, Thm. 1.2\n(d) and Cor. 1.2.1]. The case nD = 0 of Theorem 1 (c) is trivial.\nThe identity component (resp. the reduced group) of an affine group\nscheme \u266f over k will be denoted as \u266f0 (resp. \u266fred ). A connected smooth affine\ngroup over k is called unipotent if Gm is not a subgroup of it.\nThe following three consequences of Theorem 1 and its proof are proved\nin Subsections 4.1 to 4.3 (respectively).\nCorollary 1 We have nD \u2264 cd. If D is not ordinary, then we have nD \u2264\ncd + 1 \u2212 a2D \u2264 cd.\nCorollary 2 The following three properties hold:\n(a) Let i, l \u2208 N\u2217 with i < l. Then the image of the restriction homomorphism Aut\nAut(D[pl ]) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pi ]) (or of End\nEnd(D[pl ]) \u2192 End\nEnd(D[pi ])) is finite if\nand only if l \u2212 i \u2265 nD .\n(b) We assume that D is not ordinary. Let n be the greatest positive\ninteger such that the image of the restriction homomorphism Aut\nAut(D[pn ]) \u2192\nAut\nAut(D[p]) (or of End\nEnd(D[pn ]) \u2192 End\nEnd(D[p])) has positive dimension. Then\nwe have n = nD .\n(c) For all s \u2208 N\u2217 we have nDs = nD .\nCorollary 3 Let i, l \u2208 N\u2217 with i < l. Then the following five properties hold:\n(a) The restriction homomorphism Aut\nAut(D[pl ])0red \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0red is trivial if and only if l \u2212 i \u2265 nD .\n(b) The connected smooth affine group scheme Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0red is unipotent.\n(c) If i \u2265 nD + 1, then the exponent of the group Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0 (k) is pnD .\n(d) If i \u2265 2nD , then Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0red is commutative.\n(e) If i \u2265 nD + 1, then there exist canonical bijections Aut\nAut(D[pl ])0 (k) \u2192\ni\n0\nAut\nAut(D[p ]) (k). If moreover i \u2265 2nD , then these bijections are group isomorphisms.\nCorollary 1 refines [Tr1, Thm. 3] (if D is not ordinary, then aD could\nbe any integer in the interval [1, min{c, d}]). See Subsection 4.4 for a refinement of Corollary 1 in terms of Newton polygon slopes of D. Based on the\nabove results and [Va3], in [LNV] a corrected, refined, and optimal version\nof Traverso's isomorphism conjecture is proved.\n4\n\n\f1.2\n\nApplications of group actions\n\nIn Section 3 we introduce certain group actions over k whose sets of orbits\nparametrize isomorphism classes of (truncations of) p-divisible groups over\nk of codimension c and dimension d. These group actions encode all the data\none could possible think of in connection to (truncations of) p-divisible groups\nover k of codimension c and dimension d (e.g., encode their i-numbers, their\ngroup schemes of automorphisms, their specializations, all possible stratifications associated to them, their local deformations, etc.). As in [Tr3, Sects.\n26 to 39], [Va2, Sect. 2], and [Va4, Subsect. 4.2.2 and Sect. 5.1], these group\nactions involve (projective limits of) connected smooth affine groups over k.\nThe idea of using group actions to study isomorphism classes of (truncations\nof) p-divisible groups over k goes back to Manin (see [Ma, Ch. III, Sect.\n3]). But Manin used disjoint unions (indexed by finite sets of isomorphism\nclasses of special p-divisible groups over k) of discrete actions (i.e. of actions\ninvolving finite groups). In this paper, we only use group actions in order to\nprove the two principles below and to apply the first principle to the proofs\nof Theorem 1 (b) and (c) and of Theorem 4 below.\nWe call two group schemes over k radicially isogenous if their perfections\nare isomorphic group schemes over k (to be compared with [Se, Subsect. 1.2,\nDef. 1], where the terminology equivalent is used). The next two theorems are\nproved in Subsections 3.3 and 3.6 (respectively) and form progress towards\nthe solution of Problems 2 and 4.\nTheorem 2 (Unipotent Principle) Let c, d, m, and D be as above. Then\nthe set of isomorphism classes of lifts of D[pm ] to BTm+1 's over k is in natural\nbijection to the set of orbits of a suitable action Tm+1 \u00d7k Vm+1 \u2192 Vm+1 over\nk which has the following three properties:\n(i) the group scheme Tm+1 over k is smooth, affine, and its identity component is a unipotent group of dimension r 2 + \u03b3D (m);\n(ii) the k-scheme Vm+1 is an affine space of dimension r 2 ;\n2\n(iii) we have a short exact sequence 1 \u2192 Gar \u2192 Tm+1 \u2192 Cm \u2192 1,\nwhere Cm is a smooth, affine group over k that is radicially isogenous to\nAut\nAut(D[pm ])red .\nTheorem 3 (Centralizing Principle) Let D be as above. Let R be the\nnormalization of k[[x]] in an algebraic closure k1 of k((x)). Let D be a pdivisible group over Spec R whose fibre over k is D. We assume that there\n5\n\n\fexists a p-divisible group D \u2032 over k such that Dk\u2032 1 is isomorphic to Dk1 (thus\nwe have \u03b3D\u2032 (i) \u2264 \u03b3D (i) for all i \u2208 N\u2217 , cf. fact (a) of Subsection 1.1). Then\nthe following two properties hold:\n(a) If there exists l \u2208 N\u2217 such that \u03b3D\u2032 (l) = \u03b3D (l), then D \u2032 [pl ] is isomorphic to D[pl ]; thus for i \u2208 {1, . . . , l} we have \u03b3D\u2032 (i) = \u03b3D (i).\n(b) We have sD\u2032 \u2264 sD . If sD\u2032 = sD , then D \u2032 is isomorphic to D.\nOne could phrase the Centralizing Principle as: centralizing sequences go\nquasi-strictly up under specializations. Theorem 3 (b) justifies our terminology specializing height. In Subsection 3.7 we use the strict inequalities of\nTheorem 1 (b) and the Unipotent Principle to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 4 Let B be an arbitrary BTm over k. Let D be a p-divisible group\nover k such that B = D[pm ], cf. [Il, Thm. 4.4 e)]. If m < nD , then there\nexists an infinite set of BTm+1 's over k which are pairwise non-isomorphic\nand which lift B.\nThe case m = 1 of Theorem 4 is a stronger form of [Oo3, Thm. B].\n\n1.3\n\nGeneralizations\n\nIn Section 5 we present different generalizations of Theorem 1 to relative\ncontexts provided by quadruples of the form (M, \u03c6, \u03b8, G), where (M, \u03c6, \u03b8) is\nthe contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 module of D and where G is a smooth integral\nclosed subgroup scheme of GL M subject to a weakening of the two axioms\nof [Va2, Subsect. 4.1] (the case G = GL M corresponds to the above classical context provided by D itself). Three examples of special interest are\npresented in Section 6. They pertain to group schemes of homomorphisms\nbetween BTm 's, to group schemes of automorphisms of filtered BTm 's, and\nto group schemes of automorphisms of BTm 's equipped with (symmetric)\nprincipal quasi-polarizations. The motivation for all these generalizations\nstems out from applications to level m stratifications of special fibres of good\nintegral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type in unramified mixed characteristic (0, p) (see [Va2, Sect 4]).\nAppendix A contains basic properties of affine group schemes over discrete valuation rings that are needed to present the group actions of Sections\n3 and 5. Appendix B presents properties of exponential and logarithmic\nmaps for matrices in p-adic contexts that are required for the mentioned\ngeneralizations.\n6\n\n\f2\n\nGroup schemes of endomorphisms\n\nAlways c, d, r, m, D, aD , Aut\nAut(D[pi ]), and End\nEnd(D[pi ]) will be as in Section 1.\nLet l, i \u2208 N be such that l \u2265 i. We first list three properties of End\nEnd(D[pi ])\n(see Subsection 2.1) and then we use them to prove Theorem 1 (a) (see\nSubsection 2.2). A homomorphism between affine group schemes over k is\ncalled an epimorphism (resp. a monomorphism) if it is faithfully flat (resp.\nis a closed embedding).\n\n2.1\n\nBasic properties\n\nAs the scheme Aut\nAut(D[pi ]) is an open subscheme of End\nEnd(D[pi ]) and as all\ni\nconnected components of End\nEnd(D[p ]) have the same dimension, we get that:\nEnd\n(i) We have \u03b3D (i) = dim(End\nEnd(D[pi ])).\nLet jl,i : D[pl ] \u0589 D[pi ] be the epimorphism defined by the multiplication\nby pl\u2212i . Let ii,l : D[pi ] \u0592\u2192 D[pl ] be the natural inclusion monomorphism.\nWe consider the monomorphism\n\u03bai,l : End\nEnd(D[pi ]) \u0592\u2192 End\nEnd(D[pl ])\ndefined on valued points as follows. If R is a commutative k-algebra, then\n\u03bai,l (R) maps fi \u2208 End\nEnd(D[pi ])(R) to ii,l,R \u25e6 fi \u25e6 jl,i,R \u2208 End\nEnd(D[pl ])(R). Let\nrl,i : End\nEnd(D[pl ]) \u2192 End\nEnd(D[pi ])\nbe the restriction homomorphism (associated to the monomorphism ii,l :\nD[pi ] \u0592\u2192 D[pl ]). Let fl \u2208 End\nEnd(D[pl ])(R). It is easy to see that there exists\nfi \u2208 End\nEnd(D[pi ])(R) such that \u03bai,l (R)(fi ) = fl if and only if Ker(fl ) contains\nD[pl\u2212i ]R = Ker(jl,i )R (i.e. if and only if rl,l\u2212i (R)(fl ) = 0 \u2208 End\nEnd(D[pl\u2212i ])(R)).\nFrom this we get that:\n(ii) We have an exact complex\nrl,l\u2212i\n\n\u03bai,l\n\nEnd(D[pl\u2212i ]).\nEnd(D[pl ]) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 End\n0 \u2192 End\nEnd(D[pi ]) \u2212\u2212\u2192 End\nFrom properties (i) and (ii), at the level of dimensions we get that:\n(iii) The image Im(rl,l\u2212i ) has dimension \u03b3D (l) \u2212 \u03b3D (i).\n\n7\n\n\f2.2\n\nProof of Theorem 1 (a)\n\nLet i, l \u2208 N. As we have ri+1+l,l = ri+l,l \u25e6 ri+1+l,i+l , Im(ri+1+l,l ) is a subgroup\nscheme of Im(ri+l,l ). Thus we have dim(Im(ri+l,l )) \u2265 dim(Im(ri+1+l,l )). From\nthis and the property 2.1 (iii) we get that the sequence (\u03b3D (i + l) \u2212 \u03b3D (i))i\u2208N\nis a decreasing sequence in N. Therefore Theorem 1 (a) holds.\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nIsomorphism classes of p-divisible groups as\norbits of group actions\n\nWe construct group actions over k whose sets of orbits parametrize isomorphism classes of p-divisible groups over k of codimension c and dimension\nd (see Subsections 3.1 and 3.2 that follow the pattern of [Va2]). Theorem\n2 is proved in Subsection 3.3. Subsection 3.4 recalls basic results on group\nactions over k; we use them to prove Theorems 1, 3, and 4 in Subsections\n3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 (respectively).\nLet W (k) be the ring of (p-typical) Witt vectors with coefficients in k. Let\nB(k) be the field of fractions of W (k). Let \u03c3 be the Frobenius automorphism\nof k, W (k), and B(k). Let (M, \u03c6, \u03b8) be the contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 module\nof D in the sense of [BBM, Def. 3.1.5], where \u03c6 and \u03b8 are the F and V\nof loc. cit. Thus M is a free W (k)-module of rank r, \u03c6 : M \u2192 M is a\n\u03c3-linear endomorphism, \u03b8 : M \u2192 M is a \u03c3 \u22121 -linear endomorphism, and we\nhave \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c6 = p1M . The \u03c3-linear automorphism \u03c6[ 1p ] : M[ p1 ] \u2192 M[ p1 ]\nand its inverse will be denoted simply by \u03c6 and \u03c6\u22121 (respectively); thus\n\u03c6\u22121 (M) := (\u03c6[ 1p ])\u22121 (M). We denote also by \u03c6 the \u03c3-linear automorphism of\nEnd(M)[ p1 ] which takes e \u2208 End(M)[ 1p ] to \u03c6(e) := \u03c6 \u25e6 e \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 End(M)[ p1 ].\nWe refer to [BBM] for the crystalline contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 functor D\ndefined on the category of p-divisible groups over k-schemes.\nWe recall that m \u2208 N\u2217 . Let \u03c6m , \u03b8m : M/pm M \u2192 M/pm M be the rem\nductions modulo pm of \u03c6, \u03b8 : M \u2192 M. Let \u266e(\u03c3 ) be the pull-back (or the\ntensorization) of \u266e with \u03c3 m . Thus M (\u03c3) := W (k) \u2297\u03c3,W (k) M, etc.\n\n3.1\n\nGroup schemes\n\nIn this subsection we introduce several affine group schemes.\n\n8\n\n\f3.1.1\n\nA dilatation\n\nLet F\u0304 1 be the kernel of \u03c61 ; it is a k-vector subspace of M/pM of dimension\nd. Let W be the normalizer of F\u0304 1 in GL M/pM . If cd = 0, then W = GL M/pM .\nIf cd > 0, then W is a maximal proper parabolic subgroup of GL M/pM . Let\nH\u0303 be the dilatation of GL M centered on the smooth subgroup W of GL M/pM\n(see Appendix A). Thus H\u0303 is a smooth affine group scheme over Spec W (k)\nequipped with a homomorphism P\u0303 : H\u0303 \u2192 GL M that has the following\nuniversal property: a morphism f : S \u2192 GL M of flat Spec W (k)-schemes\nfactors (uniquely) through P\u0303 if and only if the morphism fk : Sk \u2192 GL M/pM\nfactors through W. The generic fibre of P\u0303 is an isomorphism of Spec B(k)schemes and thus the relative dimension of H\u0303 over Spec W (k) is r 2 . The\nspecial fibre H\u0303k is connected and we can redefine P\u0303 as follows (cf. Example of Appendix A for details). We can identify H\u0303 with the schematic closure GL M,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) in GL M \u00d7W (k) GL \u03c6\u22121 (M ) of GL M [ 1 ] embedded diagonally in\np\n\nGL M \u00d7W (k) GL \u03c6\u22121 (M ) . Under this identification, P\u0303 gets identified with the\nfirst projection homomorphism GL M,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) \u2192 GL M . The homomorphism\nH\u0303 \u2192 GL \u03c6\u22121 (M ) which is the composite of the identification H\u0303 = GL M,\u03c6\u22121 (M )\nwith the second projection homomorphism GL M,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) \u2192 GL \u03c6\u22121 (M ) , is isomorphic to the dilatation of GL \u03c6\u22121 (M ) centered on the parabolic subgroup\nof GL \u03c6\u22121 (M )/p\u03c6\u22121 (M ) that normalizes the k-vector subspace M/p\u03c6\u22121 (M) of\n\u03c6\u22121 (M)/p\u03c6\u22121 (M).\nFor a commutative W (k)-algebra R and for h\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303(R), let h := P\u0303(R)(h\u0303) \u2208\nGL M (R). For e \u2208 End(M), g \u2208 GL M (W (k)), and h\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303(W (k)), let\ne[m] \u2208 End(M/pm M), g[m] \u2208 GLM (Wm (k)), and h\u0303[m] \u2208 H\u0303(Wm (k)) be\nthe reductions modulo pm (here Wm (k) = W (k)/pmW (k)).\nFact 1 Let g, g1 \u2208 GL M (W (k)). Let g2 := gg1\u03c6(g \u22121) \u2208 GL M (B(k)) (thus\ngg1\u03c6 = g2 \u03c6g). Then we have g2 \u2208 GL M (W (k)) if and only if there exists\nh\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303(W (k)) such that g = h.\nProof: We have g2 = gg1\u03c6(g \u22121 ) \u2208 GL M (W (k)) if and only if g normalizes\n\u03c6\u22121 (M) and thus if and only if g[1] normalizes p\u03c6\u22121 (M)/pM = F\u0304 1 . But\ng[1] normalizes F\u0304 1 (i.e. we have g[1] \u2208 W(k)) if and only if there exists\nh\u0303 \u2208 P\u0303(W (k)) such that g = h, cf. the above universal property.\n\u0003\n\n9\n\n\f3.1.2\n\nOn H\u0303(\u03c3)\n\nThe group scheme H\u0303(\u03c3) is the dilatation of GL M (\u03c3) centered on the subgroup scheme W (\u03c3) of GL M (\u03c3) /pM (\u03c3) . One can define H\u0303(\u03c3) more intrinsically\nas follows. We identify \u03c6 and \u03b8 with W (k)-linear maps \u03c6 : M (\u03c3) \u2192 M\nand \u03b8 : M \u2192 M (\u03c3) . Let Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) be the closed subgroup scheme of\nGL M (\u03c3) \u00d7W (k) GL M that represents the functor of automorphisms of the pair\nof W (k)-linear maps \u03c6 and \u03b8. If R is a commutative W (k)-algebra, then\nAut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8)(R) is the group of those pairs (\u00e3, b\u0303) \u2208 GLM (\u03c3) (R) \u00d7 GLM (R) for\nwhich we have b\u0303 \u25e6 (1R \u2297 \u03c6) = (1R \u2297 \u03c6) \u25e6 \u00e3 and \u00e3 \u25e6 (1R \u2297 \u03b8) = (1R \u2297 \u03b8) \u25e6 b\u0303.\nUnder the W (k)-linear isomorphism M \u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (M)(\u03c3) induced by \u03c6\u22121 ,\nthe group scheme Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) becomes isomorphic to the group scheme over\nSpec W (k) that represents the functor of automorphisms of the pair of W (k)linear maps M (\u03c3) o\n\nj (\u03c3)\n\n/\np\n\n\u03c6\u22121 (M) (\u03c3) , where j : M \u0592\u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (M) is the inclusion.\n\nThus Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) is isomorphic to the schematic closure GL M (\u03c3) ,\u03c6\u22121 (M )(\u03c3) in\nGL M (\u03c3) \u00d7W (k) GL \u03c6\u22121 (M )(\u03c3) of GL M (\u03c3) [ 1 ] embedded diagonally in the product\np\nGL M (\u03c3) \u00d7W (k) GL \u03c6\u22121 (M )(\u03c3) , cf. Example of Appendix A. Thus we have natAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) (cf. Subsubsecural isomorphisms H\u0303(\u03c3) \u2192 GL M (\u03c3) ,\u03c6\u22121 (M )(\u03c3) \u2192 Aut\ntion 3.1.1 for the first one) and under their composite, the homomorphism\n(\u03c3)\nP\u0303 (\u03c3) : H\u0303(\u03c3) \u2192 GL M = GL M (\u03c3) gets identified with the first projection homomorphism Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) \u2192 GL M (\u03c3) . The first (resp. second) projection homoAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) \u2192 GL M ) is the dilatation\nmorphism Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) \u2192 GL M (\u03c3) (resp.

Let Set be the category of\nsets. Let X be an affine scheme over Spec W (k) of finite type. Let Wm (X) :\nAffk \u2192 Set be the contravariant functor that associates to an affine k-scheme\nSpec R the set X(Wm (R)), where Wm (R) is the ring of Witt vectors of length\nm with coefficients in R. It is well known that this functor is representable\nby an affine k-scheme of finite type (cf. [Gre, Sect. 4, Cor. 1, p. 639]) to\nbe also denoted as Wm (X). We have Wm (X)(k) = X(Wm (k)) as well as a\nfunctorial identification W1 (X) = Xk . If f : Y \u2192 X is a closed embedding,\nthen Wm (f ) : Wm (Y ) \u2192 Wm (X) is also a closed embedding (cf. [Gre, Sect.\n10\n\n\f4, Cor. 2, p. 639]).\nWe assume that X is smooth over Spec W (k). If J is an ideal of R of square\n0, then the ideal Ker(Wm (R) \u2192 Wm (R/J)) is of square 0 and therefore the\nreduction map X(Wm (R)) \u2192 X(Wm (R/J)) is surjective (cf. [BLR, Ch. 2,\nSect. 2.2, Prop. 6]). From this and loc. cit. we get that the affine k-scheme\nWm (X) of finite type is smooth.\nWe assume that X is a smooth affine group scheme over Spec W (k).\nThen Wm (X) is a smooth affine group over k. The length reduction W (k)epimorphisms Wm+1 (R) \u0589 Wm (R) define naturally a smooth epimorphism\nRedm+1,X : Wm+1 (X) \u0589 Wm (X)\nof affine groups over k (the smoothness part is checked as in the previous\nparagraph). The kernel of Redm+1,X is the vector group over k defined by\nm\nthe Lie algebra Lie(Xk )(\u03c3 ) , and thus it is a unipotent commutative group\ndim(Xk )\nisomorphic to Ga\n. Using this and the identification W1 (X) = Xk , by\n\u2217\ninduction on m \u2208 N we get that:\n(i) we have dim(Wm (X)) = m dim(Xk );\n(ii) the group Wm (X) is connected if and only if Xk is connected.\n\n3.2\n\nThe group actions T\n\nGLM ). In this paper we will use only\nLet Hm := Wm (H\u0303) and Dm := Wm (GL\noccasionally the fact that Dm has a natural group structure over k. Thus we\nwill view Hm as a connected smooth affine group over k of dimension mr 2\nand (except in few places) we will view Dm as a connected smooth affine\nvariety over k of dimension mr 2 , cf. Subsubsection 3.1.3. We have an action\nTm : Hm \u00d7k Dm \u2192 Dm\ndefined on k-valued points as follows. If h\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303(W (k)) and g \u2208 GL M (W (k)),\nthen the product of h\u0303[m] \u2208 Hm (k) = H\u0303(Wm (k)) and g[m] \u2208 Dm (k) =\nGL M (Wm (k)) is the element (see Subsubsection 3.1.1 for h)\nTm (h\u0303[m], g[m]) := (hg\u03c6(h\u22121 ))[m].\nThis makes sense, cf. Fact 1. The fact that Tm is indeed a morphism follows easily from [Va2, Formula (1a)] and its natural analogs for arbitrary\ncommutative k-algebras. We recall (see [Va2, Lemma 2.2.1]) the following\nlemma:\n11\n\n\fLemma 1 Let g1 , g2 \u2208 GL M (W (k)). Then the points g1 [m], g2 [m] \u2208 Dm (k)\nbelong to the same orbit of the action Tm if and only if the Dieudonn\u00e9 modules (M/pm M, g1 [m]\u03c6m , \u03b8m g1 [m]\u22121 ) and (M/pm M, g2 [m]\u03c6m , \u03b8m g2 [m]\u22121 ) are\nisomorphic.\n3.2.1\n\nThe limit process\n\nLet \u03c1m+1 := Redm+1,H\u0303 and \u03c4m+1 := Redm+1,GL\nGL M (see Subsubsection 3.1.3 for\nnotations). Thus \u03c1m+1 : Hm+1 \u0589 Hm is the natural reduction epimorphism\nof affine groups over k and \u03c4m+1 : Dm+1 \u0589 Dm is the natural reduction\nfaithfully flat morphism (epimorphism) of affine (group) varieties over k.\nThe action Tm is a natural reduction of the action Tm+1 . In other words, the\nfollowing identity holds:\n\u03c4m+1 (Tm+1 (h\u0303[m + 1], g[m + 1])) = Tm (h\u0303[m], g[m]).\nAs \u03c1m+1 and \u03c4m+1 are morphisms of affine schemes, the projective limits\nH\u221e := proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Hm\n\nand\n\nD\u221e := proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Dm\n\nin the category of ringed spaces are also projective limits in the category of\nk-schemes (cf. [Gro, Sect. 8, Rm. 8.2.14]), H\u221e is an affine group scheme\nover k, and D\u221e is an affine (group) scheme over k. We have a limit action\nT\u221e : H\u221e \u00d7k D\u221e \u2192 D\u221e\nwith the property that for all elements h\u0303 \u2208 H\u221e (k) = H\u0303(W (k)) and g \u2208\nD\u221e (k) = GL M (W (k)), the product T\u221e (h\u0303, g) \u2208 D\u221e (k) is the unique element\nsuch that for all m \u2208 N\u2217 we have T\u221e (h\u0303, g)[m] = Tm (h\u0303[m], g[m]); thus we\nhave T\u221e (h\u0303, g) = hg\u03c6(h\u22121 ) \u2208 D\u221e (k) = GL M (W (k)).\nThere exist several equivalent ways to define orbits of the action T\u221e (see\n[GV]). To be short, in what follows by an orbit of T\u221e we mean a reduced,\n\u2032\nquasi-compact, locally closed subscheme O\u221e\nof D\u221e which is a natural projec\u2032\n\u2032\ntive limit proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Om in the category of ringed spaces of orbits Om\nof Tm\n(i.e. classical orbits of k-points) under faithfully flat transition morphisms\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthat are induced by \u03c4m+1 .

We have the following obvious\nprinciple:\n\nFact 2 There exists a natural bijection Om+1,m,1M \u2192 Om+1,m,1M [m] defined\nby the rule: the orbit o \u2208 Om+1,m,1M is mapped to the element of Om+1,m,1M [m]\nwhich is the reduced scheme of o \u2229 Vm+1 .\n3.2.3\n\nGeometric interpretations of sets of orbits\n\nLemma 2 The following three properties hold:\n(a) The set of orbits of the action Tm is in natural bijection to the set of\n(representatives of ) isomorphism classes of BTm 's over k.\n(b) The set of orbits Om+1,m,1M (or Om+1,m,1M [m] ) is in natural bijection to\nthe set of (representatives of ) isomorphism classes of BTm+1 's over k which\nlift D[pm ].\n(c) If m \u2265 nD , then Om+1,m,1M (or Om+1,m,1M [m] ) has only one orbit.\nProof: Let B\u0303 be a BTm over k. Let D\u0303 be a p-divisible group over k which\nlifts B\u0303, cf. [Il, Thm. 4.4 e)]. As D\u0303 has codimension c and dimension\n13\n\n\fd, its Dieudonn\u00e9 module is isomorphic to (M, g\u0303\u03c6, \u03b8g\u0303 \u22121 ) for some element\ng\u0303 \u2208 GLM (W (k)) = D\u221e (k). The Dieudonn\u00e9 module of B\u0303 is isomorphic to\n(M/pm M, g\u0303[m]\u03c6m , \u03b8m g\u0303[m]\u22121 ). Thus (a) and (b) are implied by Lemma 1 and\nthe classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory which provides an antiequivalence between the\ncategory of BTm 's over k and the category of Dieudonn\u00e9 modules of BTm 's\nover k (see [Fo, pp. 153 and 160], [BBM, Chs. 3 and 4], etc.).\nWe prove (c). Let B be a BTm+1 over k such that B[pm ] = D[pm ]. As\nm \u2265 nD , each p-divisible group over k that lifts B is isomorphic to D. Thus\nB is isomorphic to D[pm+1 ]. From this and (b), we get that (c) holds.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4 The following three properties hold:\n(a) In the situation of the last paragraph of Subsubsection 3.2.1, each\n\u2032\n\u2032\nprojective limit O\u221e\n:= proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Om\ntaken in the category of ringed spaces\nis also a projective limit in the category of k-schemes and it is an integral,\nquasi-compact, locally closed subscheme of D\u221e whose k-valued points form\none orbit of the action T\u221e (k) : H\u221e (k) \u00d7 D\u221e (k) \u2192 D\u221e (k) in the category of\nsets. Thus O\u221e := proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Om is the orbit of T\u221e that contains 1M \u2208\nD\u221e (k).\n(b) Two points g1 , g2 \u2208 D\u221e (k) = GL M (W (k)) belong to the same orbit\nof the action T\u221e (equivalently T\u221e (k)) if and only if the Dieudonn\u00e9 modules\n(M, g1 \u03c6, \u03b8g1\u22121) and (M, g2 \u03c6, \u03b8g2\u22121) are isomorphic. Therefore the set of orbits\nof T\u221e is in natural bijection to to the set of (representatives of ) isomorphism\nclasses of p-divisible groups over k of codimension c and dimension d.\n(c) If K is an algebraically closed field that contains k, then nDK = nD .\nProof: The classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory also provides an antiequivalence between the category of p-divisible groups over k of codimension c and dimension d and the category of Dieudonn\u00e9 modules over k which are isomorphic\nto (M, g\u03c6, \u03b8g \u22121) for some element g \u2208 GL M (W (k)).\n\u22121\nDue to Lemma 2 (c), for m \u2265 nD we have Om+1 = \u03c4m+1\n(Om ). Thus\nthe morphism Om+1 \u2192 Om induced by \u03c4m+1 is affine (as \u03c4m+1 is so). Thus\nO\u221e is an integral k-scheme. Moreover, O\u221e is the quasi-compact, locally\nclosed subscheme of D\u221e which for each m \u2265 nD is the inverse image of\nOm under the limit affine morphism \u03c4\u221e,m : D\u221e \u2192 Dm . As 1M \u2208 O\u221e (k)\n\u22121\nand O\u221e = \u03c4\u221e,m\n(Om ) for m \u2265 nD , O\u221e (k) is the set of elements g \u2208\nGL\nD\u221e (k) =\nM (W (k)) such that (cf. Lemma 2 (a)) the reduction modulo pm of (M, g\u03c6, \u03b8g \u22121) is isomorphic to the Dieudonn\u00e9 module of D[pm ] for\n14\n\n\fsome m \u2265 nD and thus (cf. the definition of nD and the classical Dieudonn\u00e9\ntheory) it is the set of elements g \u2208 GLM (W (k)) such that there exists an\nisomorphism h : (M, \u03c6, \u03b8) \u2192 (M, g\u03c6, \u03b8g \u22121), i.e. we have g = h\u03c6(h\u22121 ) for\nsome element h \u2208 GL M (W (k)). From this, Fact 1, and the definition of T\u221e\nwe get that O\u221e (k) is the orbit of 1M under the action T\u221e (k).\nAs nD admits upper bounds that depend only on c and d (cf. beginning\nof Section 1), there exists a p-divisible group D \u2032 over k such that for each\n\u2032\nm \u2208 N\u2217 the orbit Om\ncorresponds to the isomorphism class of D \u2032 [pm ] via the\n\u2032\nbijection of Lemma 2 (a). Thus as above we argue that O\u221e\nis an integral,\nquasi-compact, locally closed subscheme of D\u221e whose k-valued points form\none orbit of the action T\u221e (k). Therefore part (a) holds.\nPart (b) follows from (the proof of) (a) and the classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory.\nTo prove (c), we first remark that the action Tm,K is the analogue of the\naction Tm but working with DK instead of D. From Lemma 2 (b) and the\nvery definition of nD we get that: (i) we have nD = 0 if and only if for each\nm \u2208 N\u2217 the action Tm has only one orbit, and (ii) for n \u2208 N\u2217 , we have n \u2265 nD\nif and only if for all m \u2265 n the set of orbits Om+1,m,1M has only one element.\nFrom the last two sentences we get that for n \u2208 N we have n \u2265 nD if and\nonly if n \u2265 nDK . Thus nD = nDK , i.e. (c) holds.\n\u0003\nLet Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys be the group scheme over k of automorphisms of\n(M/pm M, \u03c6m , \u03b8m ). Thus, if R is a commutative k-algebra and if \u03c3R is the\nFrobenius endomorphism of the ring Wm (R) of Witt vectors of length m\nwith coefficients in R, then Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys (R) is the subgroup of Dm (R) =\nGLM (Wm (R)) formed by those Wm (R)-linear automorphisms \u266e of Wm (R)\u2297Wm (k)\nM/pm M that satisfy the identities (1Wm (R) \u2297 \u03c6m ) \u25e6 \u266e(\u03c3) = \u266e \u25e6 (1Wm (R) \u2297 \u03c6m )\nand \u266e(\u03c3) \u25e6 (1Wm (R) \u2297 \u03b8m ) = (1Wm (R) \u2297 \u03b8m ) \u2297 \u266e; here \u03c6m and \u03b8m are viewed as\nWm (k)-linear maps (M/pm M)(\u03c3) \u2192 M/pm M and M/pm M \u2192 (M/pm M)(\u03c3)\n(respectively). We similarly define the group scheme End\nEnd(D[pm ])crys of enm\ndomorphisms of (M/p M, \u03c6m , \u03b8m ).\nThe following result is a version of [Va2, Thm. 2.4].\nTheorem 5 Let m \u2208 N\u2217 . With the notations of Subsubsection 3.2.2, the\nfollowing four properties hold:\n0\n(a) the connected smooth affine group Cm\nis unipotent;\n(b) there exist two finite homomorphisms\n\n\u03b9m : Sm \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys and \u03b6m : Aut\nAut(D[pm ]) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys\n15\n\n\fwhich at the level of k-valued points induce isomorphisms \u03b9m (k) : Sm (k) \u2192\nAut\nAut(D[pm ])crys (k) and \u03b6m (k) : Aut\nAut(D[pm ])(k) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys(k);\n0\n(c) we have dim(Sm ) = dim(Cm ) = dim(Cm\n) = \u03b3D (m);\n0\n(d) the connected smooth affine group Tm+1 is unipotent and has dimension r 2 + \u03b3D (m).\nProof: Parts (a) to (c) are proved in [Va2, Thm. 2.4] using reduced groups.\nWe will only recall here the definitions of \u03b6m and \u03b9m . We will view Dm as a\nconnected smooth affine group over k.\nThe crystalline Dieudonn\u00e9 theory provides us with a homomorphism\n\u03b6m : Aut\nAut(D[pm ]) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys\nthat maps a point x \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])(R) to the inverse of the element of\nm\nAut\nAut(D[p ])crys (R) which is the evaluation of D(x) at the thickening Spec R \u0592\u2192\nSpec Wm (R) defined by the natural divided power structure on the kernel of\nthe epimorphism Wm (R) \u0589 R.\nThe homomorphism P\u0303 : H\u0303 \u2192 GL M provides us with a homomorphism\n\u03b9m : Sm \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys\nthat maps a point h\u0303R [m] \u2208 Sm (R) \u2282 Hm (R) = H\u0303(Wm (R)) to the point\nhR [m] := P\u0303(Wm (R))(h\u0303R [m]) \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys (R) \u2282 Dm (R) = GL M (Wm (R)).\nWe prove (d). The group Ker(\u03c1m+1 ) is a unipotent, commutative group\n0\nof dimension r 2 , cf. Subsubsection 3.1.3. As the connected group Cm\nis\nunipotent (cf. (a)) of dimension \u03b3D (m) (cf. (c)) and as we have a short\n0\n0\nexact sequence 1 \u2192 Ker(\u03c1m+1 ) \u2192 Tm+1\n\u2192 Cm\n\u2192 1 (see Subsubsection\n3.2.2), from [DGr, Vol. II, Exp. XVII, Prop. 2.2 iv)] we get that the group\n0\nTm+1\nis a unipotent group of dimension r 2 + \u03b3D (m). Thus (d) holds.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5 The smooth groups Cm , Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys,red , and Aut\nAut(D[pm ])red\nare radicially isogenous.\nProof: The finite homomorphisms \u03b9m and \u03b6m of Theorem 5 (b) are bijective.\nThus the corollary follows from [Se, Subsect. 1.2, Props. 1 and 2] (loc. cit.\nis stated for commutative group schemes over k but its proofs do not require\nthe commutativity assumption).\n\u0003\n\n16\n\n\f3.2.4\n\nTwo formulas\n\nAs \u03b3D (m) = dim(Sm ) (cf. Theorem 5 (d)), we have\n(1)\n\n\u03b3D (m) = dim(Hm ) \u2212 dim(Om ).\n\nAs dim(Hm+1 ) \u2212 dim(Hm ) = r 2 we get that\n(2)\n3.2.5\n\n\u03b3D (m + 1) \u2212 \u03b3D (m) = r 2 \u2212 dim(Om+1 ) + dim(Om ).\nDigression: a variant of the action Tm\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we describe here a variant of the action Tm\nthat appeals to Subsubsection 3.1.2.\nWe consider the functor Affk \u2192 Sets which takes Spec R to Wm (R)-linear\nisomorphisms from Wm (R) \u2297W (k) M (\u03c3) to Wm (R) \u2297W (k) M. This functor\n\u2032\nis represented by a connected smooth affine k-scheme of finite type Dm\n. If\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAut\nHm := Wm (Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8)), then we have a natural action Tm : Hm \u00d7k Dm \u2192 Dm\ndefined by transport of structure.\n(\u03c3)\nOne can check that T\u2032m is isomorphic to Tm and has properties similar to\n\u2032\nAut\nthe ones enjoyed by Tm (see below; the isomorphism Hm\n= Wm (Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8)) \u2192\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\nAut\nWm (H\u0303 ) = Hm is Wm of the isomorphism Aut(\u03c6, \u03b8) \u2192 H\u0303 of Subsubsection 3.1.2). In particular, one can use the action T\u2032m to show that the three\nsmooth groups of the Corollary 5 are in fact isomorphic. More precisely, \u03b9m\ncan be identified with the Frobenius endomorphism of Sm , \u03b6m,red can be identified with the mth -power of the Frobenius endomorphism of Aut\nAut(D[pm ])red ,\nand Ker(\u03b6m ) contains (and it is quite likely to be equal to) the kernel of the\nmth -power of the Frobenius endomorphism of Aut\nAut(D[pm ]).\nLet S = Spec A be a smooth affine k-scheme. Let the crystalline site\nCRIS(S/Wm (k)) be as in [BBM, Subsect. 1.1.1] over the natural divided\npower thickening Spec k \u0592\u2192 Spec Wm (k). One identifies the sections of\nm\nOCRIS(S/Wm (k)) with Wm (A(\u03c3 ) ), cf. [IR, III, (1.5.2), p. 142].\nFor i \u2208 {1, 2} let Bi be a BTm over k with Dieudonn\u00e9 F -crystal D(Bi ) =\n(Ni , \u03c6m,i , \u03b8m,i ). Due to the previous paragraph, morphisms D(B2,S ) \u2192 D(B1,S )\nm\nof Dieudonn\u00e9 F -crystals of CRIS(S/Wm (k)) correspond to Wm (A(\u03c3 ) )-linear\nm\nm\nmaps Wm (A(\u03c3 ) ) \u2297Wm (k) N2 \u2192 Wm (A(\u03c3 ) ) \u2297Wm (k) N1 compatible with the\nm\n\u03c6m,i 's and \u03b8m,i 's. In view of [BM, Thm. 4.1.1], such Wm (A(\u03c3 ) )-linear maps\ndescribe the abelian group Hom(B1,S , B2,S ). One can check via a direct\n\n17\n\n\finspection that the orbits of the action T\u2032m are in bijection to the set of (representatives) of isomorphism classes of BTm 's over k, to be compared with\n[Il, proof b) of Prop. 1.7].\n\n3.3\n\nProof of Theorem 2\n\nThe set of (representatives of) isomorphism classes of BTm+1 's over k which\nlift D[pm ] is in bijection to the set Om+1,m,1M [m] of orbits of the action of Tm+1\n0\non Vm+1 , cf. Lemma 2 (b). The group Tm+1\nis unipotent of dimension r 2 +\n\u03b3D (m), cf. Theorem 5 (d). Moreover Vm+1 is isomorphic to the affine space\nof dimension r 2 over k. We have a short exact sequence 1 \u2192 Ker(\u03c1m+1 ) \u2192\n2\nTm+1 \u2192 Cm \u2192 1, where Ker(\u03c1m+1 ) is isomorphic to Gra (cf. Subsubsection\n3.1.3) and where Cm is radicially isogenous to Aut\nAut(D[pm ])red (cf. Corollary\n5). Theorem 2 follows from the last four sentences.\n\u0003\n\n3.4\n\nProperties of orbits\n\nProposition 1 Let U be a smooth affine group over k whose identity component U 0 is unipotent. Let V be a reduced affine variety over k equipped\nwith an action \u039b : U \u00d7k V \u2192 V . Then all orbits of \u039b are closed. Thus, if \u039b\nhas an open, Zariski dense orbit o, then \u039b has a unique orbit (i.e. o = V ).\nProof: All orbits of the action of U 0 on V are closed, cf. [Sp, Prop. 2.4.14]\nor [DGa, Ch. IV, Sect. 2, Subsect. 2, Cor. 2.7]. Each orbit of \u039b is settheoretically a finite union of orbits of the action of U 0 on V . Thus, the\norbits of \u039b are closed. The last part of the proposition follows from the fact\nthat V is the only closed, Zariski dense subscheme of itself.\n\u0003\nWe will need the following three applications of Proposition 1 in the proofs\nof Theorems 1 and 4.\nCorollary 6 The following three properties hold:\n(a) The open embeddings Aut\nAut(D[pm ]) \u0592\u2192 End\nEnd(D[pm ]) and Aut\nAut(D[pm ])crys \u0592\u2192\nm\nEnd\nEnd(D[p ])crys are also closed.\n(b) The identity component Aut\nAut(D[pm ])0 (resp. Aut\nAut(D[pm ])0crys ) is the\ntranslation of the identity component End\nEnd(D[pm ])0 (resp. End\nEnd(D[pm ])0crys )\nvia the k-valued point 1D[pm] (resp. 1M/pm M ).\n(c) Each k-valued point of End\nEnd(D[pm ])0crys is a nilpotent endomorphism\nm\nof M/p M.\n18\n\n\fProof: We will only prove (a) and (b) for Aut\nAut(D[pm ]) and End\nEnd(D[pm ]) as\nthe arguments for their crystalline versions are the same. To prove (a), it\nsuffices to show that U := Aut\nAut(D[pm ])red is an open and closed subvariety\nof V := End\nEnd(D[pm ])red . As the identity component of U is a unipotent\ngroup (cf. Theorem 5 (a) and (b)) and as U is an orbit of the canonical left\ncomposite action of U on the affine variety V , from Proposition 1 we get that\nU is an open and closed subvariety of V . Part (b) follows from (a).\nTo prove (c), we can assume that m = 1. As each k-valued point of the\nunipotent subgroup Aut\nAut(D[p])0crys,red of GL M/pM is unipotent, the case m = 1\nfollows from (b).\nFor the sake of completeness we include an elementary second proof of\nthe corollary that does not depend on Proposition 1. It suffices to prove\nthat if U is a connected component of End\nEnd(D[p])crys , then the characteristic\npolynomial \u03c7e (T ) = det(T 1M [1] \u2212 e) of an element e \u2208 U(k) belongs to\nFp [T ] and thus due to continuity reasons it depends only on U (so if U =\nEnd\nEnd(D[p])0crys , then \u03c7e (T ) = \u03c70 (T ) = T r ). As e commutes with \u03c61 and\n\u03b81 and as we have Im(\u03c61 ) = Ker(\u03b81 ) and Ker(\u03c61 ) = Im(\u03b81 ), the short exact\nsequences of k-vector spaces 0 \u2192 Im(\u03c61 ) \u2192 M/pM \u2192 (M/pM)/ Im(\u03c61 ) \u2192 0\nand 0 \u2192 (M/pM)/ Im(\u03c61 ) \u2192 (M/pM)(\u03c3) \u2192 Im(\u03c61 ) \u2192 0 are invariant under\ne and e(\u03c3) . Thus \u03c7e (T ) = \u03c7e(\u03c3) (T ) and therefore \u03c7e (T ) \u2208 Fp [T ].\n\u0003\nLemma 3 The following three statements are equivalent:\n(i) we have dim(Om+1 ) = dim(Om ) + dim(Ker(\u03c1m+1 )) = dim(Om ) + r 2 ;\n\u22121\n(ii) we have Om+1 = \u03c4m+1\n(Om ) (i.e. we have Vm+1 \u2282 Om+1 );\n(iii) the set of orbits Om+1,m,1M (equivalently, Om+1,m,1M [m] ) is finite.\nProof: The k-scheme Vm+1 is an affine space of dimension r 2 . The fibres\nof the faithfully flat morphism Om+1 \u2192 Om induced by \u03c4m+1 have equal\ndimensions. Thus dim(Om+1 ) = dim(Om ) + dim(Vm+1 \u2229 Om+1 ). If (ii) holds,\nthen dim(Vm+1 \u2229 Om+1 ) = dim(Vm+1 ) = r 2 and therefore dim(Om+1 ) =\ndim(Om ) + r 2 . Thus (ii) implies (i). Obviously (ii) implies (iii).\nWe check that (i) implies (ii). The orbit of 1M [m + 1] under Tm+1 is\n(Vm+1 \u2229 Om+1 )red . If (i) holds, then dim(Vm+1 \u2229 Om+1 ) = dim(Om+1 ) \u2212\ndim(Om ) = r 2 = dim(Vm+1 ) and therefore Vm+1 \u2229Om+1 is an open subscheme\nof Vm+1 . Thus the action of Tm+1 on Vm+1 has an open, Zariski dense orbit.\n0\nAs Tm+1\nis a unipotent group (cf. Theorem 5 (d)), from the second part of\nProposition 1 we get that Vm+1 \u2229 Om+1 = Vm+1 , i.e. Vm+1 \u2282 Om+1 . Thus (i)\nimplies (ii).\n19\n\n\fWe check that (iii) implies (ii). As (iii) holds, the action of Tm+1 on Vm+1\nhas a finite number of orbits and thus it has an open, Zariski dense orbit. As\nin the previous paragraph we argue that this orbit is Vm+1 , i.e. Vm+1 \u2282 Om+1 .\nTherefore (iii) implies (ii). Thus the three statements are equivalent.\n\u0003\nLemma 4 If m \u2208 {1, . . . , nD \u2212 1} (thus nD \u2265 2), then \u03b3D (m + 1) 6= \u03b3D (m).\nProof: It suffices to show that the assumptions that m \u2208 {1, . . . , nD \u2212 1}\nand \u03b3D (m + 1) = \u03b3D (m) lead to a contradiction. As \u03b3D (m + 1) \u2212 \u03b3D (m) = 0,\nfrom Theorem 1 (a) (proved in Subsection 2.2) we get that the sequence\n(\u03b3D (i))i\u2265m is constant, i.e. for each integer i \u2265 m we have \u03b3D (i) = \u03b3D (m).\nIn particular, as m \u2208 {1, . . . , nD \u2212 1} we get that \u03b3D (nD ) = \u03b3D (nD \u2212 1).\nThus we have dim(OnD ) = r 2 + dim(OnD \u22121 ), cf. Formula (2). Therefore\nthe set of orbits OnD ,nD \u22121,1M (equivalently, OnD ,nD \u22121,1M [nD \u22121] ) has one element (cf. the equivalence of statements (i) and (ii) of Lemma 3). Thus each\nBTnD over k that lifts D[pnD \u22121 ] is isomorphic to D[pnD ], cf. Lemma 2 (b).\nLet D \u2032 be a p-divisible group over k such that D \u2032 [pnD \u22121 ] is isomorphic\nto D[pnD \u22121 ]. We know that D \u2032 [pnD ] is isomorphic to D[pnD ], cf. previous\nparagraph. Thus D \u2032 is isomorphic to D, cf. the definition of nD . Therefore\nwe have nD \u2264 nD \u2212 1 (again cf. the definition of nD ), a contradiction.\n\u0003\n\n3.5\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nWe know that Theorem 1 (a) holds, cf. Subsection 2.2. From Theorem\n1 (a) and Lemma 4 we get that the strict inequalities of Theorem 1 (b)\nhold. Thus to end the proof of Theorem 1 (b) it suffices to show that\na\n\u03b3D (1) \u2265 a2D . Taking the Cartier dual of the exact complex 0 \u2192 \u03b1 pDt \u2192 D[p]t ,\na\nwe get an exact complex D[p] \u2192 \u03b1 pDt \u2192 0. Using it and the exact complex 0 \u2192 \u03b1 apD \u2192 D[p], we get that the group scheme of homomorphisms\na\n\u03b1pDt , \u03b1 apD ) = End\n\u03b1p )aD aDt is a subgroup scheme of End\nHom\nHom(\u03b1\nEnd(\u03b1\nEnd(D[p]). At\nthe level of dimensions we get that \u03b3D (1) \u2265 aD aDt . Thus to prove that\n\u03b3D (1) \u2265 a2D it suffices to check that aD = aDt . We will use the classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory. We recall that the Dieudonn\u00e9 module of D[p] is\n(M/pM, \u03c61 , \u03b81 ). Then aD = dimk ((M/pM)/(Im(\u03c61 ) + Im(\u03b81 ))) is equal to\nr \u2212 dimk (Im(\u03c61 )) \u2212 dimk (Im(\u03b81 )) + dimk (Im(\u03c61 ) \u2229 Im(\u03b81 )) and thus also to\nr \u2212 c \u2212 d + dimk (Ker(\u03b81 ) \u2229 Ker(\u03c61 )) = dimk (Ker(\u03b81 ) \u2229 Ker(\u03c61 )) = aDt .\nThis ends the proof of Theorem 1 (b) and thus also of Theorem 1 (cf.\nSubsection 2.2 and paragraph after Theorem 1). For the sake of completeness,\nhere is a self-contained proof of Theorem 1 (c) that does not rely on [Va2].\n20\n\n\fTo prove Theorem 1 (c) we can assume that nD \u2265 1. For i \u2208 N\u2217 we\nhave \u03b3D (i) \u2264 dimk (Lie(Aut(D[pi ]))). As the k-vector space Lie(Aut(D[pi ]))\nis isomorphic to tD[p] \u2297k tD[p]t (cf. [Il, Prop. 3.1 b) and Lemma 4.1]; here\ntD[p] is the zero cohomology group of the Lie complex of D[p] as used in [Il,\nSect. 2.1]), it has dimension cd. Thus \u03b3D (i) \u2264 cd. If moreover i \u2265 nD , then\n\u22121\nfrom Lemma 2 (c) we get that we have Oi+1 = \u03c4i+1\n(Oi ) and thus from the\nequivalence of statements (i) and (ii) of Lemma 3 we get that dim(Oi+1 ) =\ndim(Oi ) + r 2 and therefore that (cf. Formula (2)) \u03b3D (i + 1) = \u03b3D (i). We\nconclude that Theorem 1 (c) holds.\n\u0003\n\n3.6\n\nProof of Theorem 3\n\nWe prove that Theorem 3 holds. The integral domain R is normal and its\nfield of fractions k1 is algebraically closed. Thus R is a perfect ring. Let\n\u03c3R be the Frobenius automorphism of the ring W (R) of (p-typical) Witt\nvectors with coefficients in R. Let (MR , \u03c6R , \u03b8R ) be the Dieudonn\u00e9 module\nof D over R (i.e. the projective limit indexed by s \u2208 N\u2217 of the evaluation of\nthe Dieudonn\u00e9 F -crystal D(D) of D at the thickening Spec R \u0592\u2192 Spec Ws (R)\ndefined by the natural divided power structure of the ideal (p) of Ws (R)).\nThus MR is a free W (R)-module of rank r, \u03c6R : MR \u2192 MR is a \u03c3R -linear\n\u22121\nendomorphism, \u03b8R : MR \u2192 MR is a \u03c3R\n-linear endomorphism, and we have\n1\n\u03c6R \u25e6 \u03b8R = \u03b8R \u25e6 \u03c6R = p1MR . Let F\u0304R be the kernel of the reduction modulo p\nof \u03c6R . As D has codimension c and dimension d and as R is local, the pair\n(MR , F\u0304R1 \u2282 MR /pMR ) is isomorphic to W (R)\u2297W (k) (M, F\u0304 1 \u2282 M/pM). Thus\nthere exists an element gR \u2208 GL M (W (R)) such that the triple (MR , \u03c6R , \u03b8R )\n\u22121\n\u22121\nis isomorphic to the triple (W (R) \u2297W (k) M, gR (\u03c3R \u2297 \u03c6), (\u03c3R\n\u2297 \u03b8)gR\n). We\n\u2217\nview gR as a point gR \u2208 D\u221e (R). For m \u2208 N , let gR [m] \u2208 Dm (R) be the\npoint defined by the reduction modulo pm of gR . Let gk1 [m] \u2208 Dm (k1 ) and\ngk [m] \u2208 Dm (k) be the points defined naturally by gR [m].\nLet g \u2032 \u2208 GL M (W (k)) be such that the Dieudonn\u00e9 module of D \u2032 is iso\u2032\nmorphic to (M, g \u2032\u03c6, \u03b8(g \u2032 )\u22121 ). Let Om\nbe the orbit of g \u2032 [m] \u2208 Dm (k) under the action Tm . As Dk1 is isomorphic to Dk\u2032 1 , for all m \u2208 N\u2217 we have\n\u2032\ngk1 [m] \u2208 Om\n(k1 ) \u2282 Dm (k1 ) (cf. Lemma 1 applied to Tm,k1 ). As D = Dk , we\nhave gk [m] \u2208 Om (k). Thus, as gk1 [m] specializes to gk [m] (via gR [m]), the\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nschematic closure \u014cm\nof Om\nin Dm contains points of Om . Thus Om \u2282 \u014cm\nand therefore we have\n(3)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndim(Om ) \u2264 dim(Om\n) = dim(\u014cm\n).\n\n21\n\n\f\u2032\n). Thus for\nSimilarly to Formula (1) we have \u03b3D\u2032 (m) = dim(Hm )\u2212dim(Om\n\u2217\n\u2032\nall m \u2208 N we have \u03b3D (m) \u2264 \u03b3D (m), cf. either (3) or fact (a) of Subsection\n1.1.\nWe assume that there exists a number l \u2208 N\u2217 such that \u03b3D\u2032 (l) = \u03b3D (l).\nThus dim(Ol ) = dim(Ol\u2032 ) = dim(\u014cl\u2032 ), cf. Formula (1). From these equalities\nand the fact that \u014cl\u2032 contains points of Ol , we get that the two orbits Ol\u2032 and\nOl coincide. Thus D \u2032 [pl ] is isomorphic to D[pl ], cf. Lemma 2 (a). This ends\nthe proof of Theorem 3 (a).\nWe prove Theorem 3 (b). Let m \u2265 max{nD , nD\u2032 }. We have sD\u2032 =\n\u03b3D\u2032 (m) \u2264 \u03b3D (m) = sD . Next we assume that sD\u2032 = sD . Thus \u03b3D\u2032 (m) =\n\u03b3D (m). Therefore D \u2032 [pm ] is isomorphic to D[pm ], cf. Theorem 3 (a). As\nm \u2265 nD , we get that D \u2032 is isomorphic to D. This ends the proof of Theorem\n3 (b) and thus also of Theorem 3.\n\u0003\n\n3.7\n\nProof of Theorem 4\n\nLet B, D, and 1 \u2264 m < nD be as in Theorem 4. To prove Theorem 4 it\nsuffices to show that there exists an infinite set I of BTm+1 's over k that has\nthe following two properties:\n(i) if B1 , B2 \u2208 I are distinct elements, then B1 is not isomorphic to B2 ;\n(ii) if B1 \u2208 I, then B1 [pm ] is isomorphic to B = D[pm ].\nBased on the first sentence of Subsection 3.3, the existence of I is equivalent\nto the fact that the set of orbits Om+1,m,1M [m] introduced in Subsubsection\n3.2.2 is infinite. We will show that the assumption that the set of orbits\nOm+1,m,1M [m] is finite, leads to a contradiction. Based on Lemma 3, we get\nthat dim(Om+1 ) = dim(Om ) + r 2. Thus \u03b3D (m + 1) \u2212 \u03b3D (m) = 0 (cf. Formula\n(2)) and this contradicts Lemma 4.\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nSome applications of Theorem 1\n\nWe begin this section by first proving the corollaries of Section 1.\n\n4.1\n\nProof of Corollary 1\n\nTo prove Corollary 1 we can assume that cd > 0. If D is ordinary, then we\nhave \u03b3D (i) = 0 for all i \u2208 N and nD = 1 \u2264 cd. Thus we can also assume\n22\n\n\fthat D is not ordinary (equivalently, that aD \u2265 1). From Theorem 1 (b) and\n(c) we get that nD \u2264 cd + 1 \u2212 \u03b3D (1) \u2264 cd + 1 \u2212 a2D \u2264 cd. Thus Corollary 1\nholds.\n\u0003\n\n4.2\n\nProof of Corollary 2\n\nTo prove Corollary 2 (a) we can assume cd > 0. Each connected component\nof the image of rl,i has dimension \u03b3D (l) \u2212 \u03b3D (l \u2212 i), cf. property 2.1 (iii).\nIf an endomorphism of D[pl ] restricts to an automorphism of D[pi ], then\nit is an automorphism. Thus the image of the restriction homomorphism\nal,i : Aut\nAut(D[pl ]) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pi ]) is Im(rl,i ) \u2229 Aut\nAut(D[pi ]) and therefore it is a\nnonempty open subscheme of Im(rl,i ). Thus the images of al,i and rl,i have\nequal dimension \u03b3D (l) \u2212 \u03b3D (l \u2212 i). We have \u03b3D (l) \u2212 \u03b3D (l \u2212 i) = 0 if and only\nif l \u2212 i \u2265 nD , cf. Theorem 1 (b) and (c). Therefore the image of al,i (or rl,i )\nis finite if and only if l \u2212 i \u2265 nD . Thus Corollary 2 (a) holds.\nFrom Corollary 2 (a) and Theorem 1 (b) and (c) we get that if D is not\nordinary (i.e. if nD > 0 and \u03b3D (1) > 0) and if n is as in Corollary 2 (b), then\nwe have n = nD . Thus Corollary 2 (b) holds.\nTo prove Corollary 2 (c), we can assume that D is not ordinary. Thus\nCorollary 2 (c) follows from Corollary 2 (b) and the fact that the image of\nthe restriction homomorphism rl,1 is finite if and only if the image of the\nanalogous restriction homomorphism obtained working with D s instead of D\nis finite.\n\u0003\n\n4.3\n\nProof of Corollary 3\n\nCorollary 3 (a) follows from Corollary 2 (a). Corollary 3 (b) follows from\nTheorem 5 (a) and (b). To check that Corollary 3 (c) to (e) hold, we\ncan assume that D is not ordinary and that i \u2265 nD + 1 \u2265 2. Let ai \u2208\nAut\nAut(D[pi ])0 (k). Let bi := \u03b6i (k)(ai ) \u2208 Di (k) = GL\nGL(Wi (k)) be the crystalline\nrealization of ai , cf. the notations of Subsection 3.2. Due to Corollary 3\n(a), we can write bi = 1M [i] + ps(ai ) ei , where s(ai ) \u2208 {i \u2212 nD , . . . , i} and\nei \u2208 End(M/pi M) \\ p End(M/pi M); moreover there exist elements ai with\ns(ai ) = i \u2212 nD . Corollary 3 (c) follows from this once we check that the\norder of the element bi (equivalently ai ) is pi\u2212s(ai ) . It suffices to consider\nthe case when nD \u2265 2 and (p, i, s(ai )) = (2, nD + 1, 1) and to show that\nb2i = 1M [i] + 4(ei + e2i ) is not congruent to 1M [i] modulo 8. In such a case, the\nreduction \u0113i modulo 2 of ei is a non-zero nilpotent element of End(M/2M)\n23\n\n\f(the elements \u0113i together with 0 are the k-valued points of a connected smooth\nsubgroup of End\nEnd(D[2])0crys and thus are nilpotent, cf. Corollary 6 (c) applied\nwith m = 1); thus \u0113i 6= \u01132i (i.e. b2i is not congruent to 1M [i] modulo 8).\nIf a\u2032i \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0 (k) is another element whose crystalline realization is\n\u2032\n\u2032\nbi = 1M [i] + ps(ai ) e\u2032i \u2208 GL\nGL(Wi (k)) with e\u2032i \u2208 End(M/pi M) \\ p End(M/pi M),\n\u2032\nthen bi and b\u2032i commute modulo pmin{s(ai )+s(ai ),i} . If i \u2265 2nD , then s(ai ) +\ns(a\u2032i ) \u2265 2(i \u2212 nD ) \u2265 i and thus bi and b\u2032i commute. Thus Corollary 3 (d)\nholds. If l > i \u2265 nD + 1 and al \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[pl ])0 (k) has crystalline realization\nbl = 1M [l] + ps(al ) el , then there exists a unique element i al \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0 (k)\ns(al )\u2212l+i\nwhose crystalline realization is i bl = 1M [i] + p\nel [i], where el [i] is the\ni\nreduction modulo p of el . The rule al 7\u2192 i al defines the canonical bijection\nAut\nAut(D[pl ])0 (k) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pi ])0 (k) which has the desired properties. Thus\nCorollary 3 (e) holds.\n\u0003\n\n4.4\n\nA refinement of Corollary 1\n\nWe recall that sD = \u03b3D (nD ). If D is ordinary, then sD = 0 = aD and nD \u2264 1.\nThus in this subsection we will assume that D is not ordinary. From Theorem\n1 (b) we get that nD \u2264 sD + 1 \u2212 \u03b3D (1) \u2264 sD + 1 \u2212 a2D . As D is not ordinary,\nwe have aD \u2265 1 and thus we have\nnD \u2264 sD + 1 \u2212 a2D \u2264 sD .\n\n(4)\n\nDieudonn\u00e9's classification of F -isocrystals over k implies that we have a\ndirect sum decomposition (M[ 1p ], \u03c6) = \u2295vs=1 (Ws , \u03c6) into simple F -isocrystals\nover k (here v is a positive integer). More precisely, for s \u2208 {1, . . . , v} there\nexist cs , ds \u2208 N such that rs := cs + ds > 0, g.c.d.{cs , ds } = 1, dimB(k) (Ws ) =\nrs , and moreover there exists a B(k)-basis for Ws formed by elements fixed by\np\u2212ds \u03c6rs ; the unique Newton polygon slope of (Ws , \u03c6) is \u03b1s := drss \u2208 Q \u2229 [0, 1].\nWe have\nv\n\n(5)\n\nv\n\nv\n\nv\n\n1 XX\n1 XX\nrs rt |\u03b1s \u2212 \u03b1t | = cd \u2212\n|cs dt \u2212 ct ds |,\nsD = cd \u2212\n2 s=1 t=1\n2 s=1 t=1\n\ncf.

The p-divisible group D\u1ef8 is isomorphic to C/L, where the pdivisible group C := D\u0303m,m \u00d7iD (m) \u1ef8 is equipped with an isomorphism \u03b81 :\nC \u2192 D\u0303 \u00d7k \u1ef8 and where L is the pull-back of (D[p\u03ba ]/K) \u00d7k \u1ef8 \u2282 D\u0303[p\u03ba ] via\nan isomorphism \u03b82 : C[pm\u2212\u03ba ] \u2192 D\u0303[pm\u2212\u03ba ] \u00d7k \u1ef8 . Let \u03c9 := \u03b81 [pm\u2212\u03ba ] \u25e6 \u03b82\u22121 \u2208\nAut\nAut(D\u0303[pm\u2212\u03ba ])(\u1ef8 ). We can assume that the restriction of \u03c9 to the closed\npoint Spec k of \u1ef8 is the identity. The reduced group E of the image of\nthe restriction homomorphism Aut\nAut(D\u0303[pm\u2212\u03ba ]) \u2192 Aut\nAut(D\u0303[p\u03ba ]) is a finite, \u00e9tale\ngroup over k (cf. either Corollary 2 (a) for m \u2265 2\u03ba + nD\u0303 or [Va1, Thm.\n5.1.1 (c)] for m >> 0). As the k-scheme \u1ef8 is connected and reduced (being\nintegral), the restriction of \u03c9 to an automorphism of D\u0303[p\u03ba ]\u1ef8 is a \u1ef8 -valued\npoint of E which is the identity as its restriction to the closed point Spec k of\n\u1ef8 is so. From this we easily get that the p-divisible group D\u1ef8 is isomorphic\nto D \u00d7k \u1ef8 .\n\n5\n\nGeneralizations to relative contexts\n\nWe recall that (M, \u03c6, \u03b8) is the contravarint Dieudonn\u00e9 module of D and that\nwe denote also by \u03c6 : End(M)[ p1 ] \u2192 End(M)[ p1 ] the \u03c3-linear automorphism\ninduced naturally by \u03c6. Let G be a smooth closed subgroup scheme of GL M\nsuch that its generic fibre GB(k) is connected. Thus the scheme G is integral.\nLet g := Lie(G) be the Lie algebra of G. Until the end we will assume that\nthe following two axioms hold for the triple (M, \u03c6, G):\n(AX1) the Lie subalgebra g[ p1 ] of End(M)[ p1 ] is stable under \u03c6, i.e. we\nhave \u03c6(g[ p1 ]) = g[ p1 ];\n(AX2) there exist a direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 such that\nthe following two properties hold:\n(a) the kernel F\u0304 1 of the reduction modulo p of \u03c6 is F 1 /pF 1 ;\n(b) the cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL M which acts trivially on F 0 and via the\ninverse of the identical character of Gm on F 1 , normalizes G.\nThe triple (M, \u03c6, G) is called an F -crystal with a group over k, cf.

Let Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G := \u03b6m\n(Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G\ncrys ).\nm G\nm\nThus Aut\nAut(D[p ]) (k) is the subgroup of Aut\nAut(D[p ])(k) formed by those elements that define (via \u03b6m ) elements of G(Wm (k)).\nG\nAut\nAut\n(b) For i \u2208 N\u2217 let \u03b3D\n(i) := dim(Aut\nAut(D[pi ])G ) = dim(Aut\nAut(D[pi ])G\ncrys ). Let\nG\nG\n\u03b3D (0) := 0. We call (\u03b3D (i))i\u2208N the centralizing G-sequence of D.\nAs in Subsection 3.2 we argue that we have an action\nG\nG\nG\nTG\nm : Hm \u00d7k Dm \u2192 Dm\n\nwhich is the natural restriction of the action Tm . Thus, if h\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303G (W (k))\nG\nand g \u2208 G(W (k)), then the product of h\u0303[m] \u2208 Hm\n(k) = H\u0303G (Wm (k)) and\nG\ng[m] \u2208 Dm\n(k) = G(Wm (k)) is Tm (h\u0303[m], g[m]) := (hg\u03c6(h\u22121))[m], where h :=\nP\u0303 G (W (k))(h\u0303) \u2208 G(W (k)) has the same meaning as in Subsubsection 3.1.1.\nLet nG\nD be the smallest non-negative integer that has the following propG\nerty: for each element g\u0303 \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to 1M modulo pnD , there\nexists an inner isomorphism between (M, \u03c6, G) and (M, g\u0303\u03c6, G). The existence of nG\nD is implied by [Va1, Main Thm. A]. If G = GL M , then it is easy\nto check based on Lemmas 1 and 2 and Corollary 4 (a) and (b) that we have\nnG\nD = nD (cf. also either [Va1, Lemma 3.2.2 and Cor. 3.2.3] or [NV1, Thm.\n2.2 (a)]).\nG\nLet \u03c1G\nm+1 := Redm+1,H\u0303G and \u03c4m+1 := Redm+1,G (see Subsubsection 3.1.3\nG\nG\nfor notations). Thus \u03c1G\nm+1 : Hm+1 \u0589 Hm is the natural reduction epimorG\nG\nG\nphism of smooth affine groups over k and \u03c4m+1\n: Dm+1\n\u0589 Dm\nis the natural\nreduction faithfully flat morphism (epimorphism) of affine (group) varieties\nG\nover k. The action TG\nm is also a natural reduction of the action Tm+1 . The\nprojective limits\nG\nG\n:= proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Hm\nH\u221e\n\nand\n\nG\nG\nD\u221e\n:= proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Dm\n\nin the category of ringed spaces are also projective limits in the category of\nG\nG\nk-schemes, H\u221e\nis an affine group scheme over k, and D\u221e\nis an affine (group)\nscheme over k. Moreover, we have a limit action\nG\nG\nG\nTG\n\u221e : H\u221e \u00d7k D\u221e \u2192 D\u221e .\nG\nG\nG\nLet Om\nbe the orbit of 1M [m] \u2208 Dm\n(k) under the action TG\nm . Let Sm be\nG\nthe subgroup scheme of Hm which is the stabilizer of 1M [m]. Inside Hm , we\n\n27\n\n\fG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nhave Sm\n= Sm \u2229 Hm\n. Let Cm\n:= Sm,red\n. We have dim(Sm\n) = dim(Cm\n) =\nG\nG\nG\nG\ndim(Hm ) \u2212 dim(Om ) = mdG \u2212 dim(Om ). The orbits of T\u221e are defined\nsimilarly to the orbits of T\u221e (see Subsubsection 3.2.1).\n\nLemma 6 The set of orbits of TG\nm is in natural bijection to the set of (representatives of ) inner isomorphism classes of quadruples of the form\n(M/pm M, g[m]\u03c6m , \u03b8m g[m]\u22121 , GWm (k) ) with g \u2208 G(W (k)).\nProof: The rule that maps the orbit of g[m] under TG\nm to the inner isom\n\u22121\nmorphism class of (M/p M, g[m]\u03c6m , \u03b8m g[m] , GWm (k) ) is well defined (cf.\ndefinition of TG\nm ) and we are left to check that the resulting map is a bijection. It suffices to show that if g1 , g2 , g3 \u2208 G(W (k)) are as in Definition 1 (b), then there exists h\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303G (W (k)) such that TG\nm (h\u0303[m], g1 [m]) =\ng2 [m]. The pair (g3 [m], (g2\u22121 g3 g1 )[m]) is an automorphism of the pair of maps\nM/pm M o\n\n\u03c6m\n\n/\n\u03b8m\n\nM/pm M . Thus the pair (g3 [m], \u03c6\u22121 (g2\u22121 g3 g1 )[m]\u03c6) is an isomor-\n\nphism of the pair of Wm (k)-linear maps M/pm M o\n\njm\n\n/\np\n\n\u03c6\u22121 (M) /pm \u03c6\u22121 (M),\n\nwhere jm is the reduction modulo pm of the inclusion M \u0592\u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (M).\nBased on the axiom (AX2), the group GB(k) is well positioned with respect\nto (M, \u03c6\u22121 (M)) in the sense of Definition 3 of Appendix A (cf. Proposition 4 of Appendix A applied to (W (k), p, G, \u03bcB(k), \u03c6\u22121 (M)) instead of\n(R, \u03c0, GM , \u03bb, M \u2032 )). For the remaining part of the proof we will only use\nthis well positioned property which asserts the existence of an isomorphism\nGLM,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) .\n\u0398 : H\u0303G = GB(k),M,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) \u2192 G\u2217B(k),M,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) := (G\u00d7W (k) \u03c6\u22121 G\u03c6)\u2229GL\nWe have (g3 [m], \u03c6\u22121 (g2\u22121 g3 g1 )[m]\u03c6) \u2208 G\u2217B(k),M,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) (Wm (k)), cf. first before last paragraph and axiom (AX1) which implies that \u03c6\u22121 g2\u22121 g3 g1 \u03c6 \u2208\nG(B(k)). Let h\u0303 \u2208 H\u0303G (W (k)) be an element that lifts the unique element\nh\u0303[m] \u2208 H\u0303G (Wm (k)) for which we have \u0398(h\u0303[m]) = (g3 [m], \u03c6\u22121 (g2\u22121g3 g1 )[m]\u03c6)\n(cf. previous paragraph). Therefore P\u0303 G (h\u0303[m]) = g3 [m] and the linear automorphisms of \u03c6\u22121 (M)/pm \u03c6\u22121 (M) induced by h\u0303 and \u03c6\u22121 (g2\u22121g3 g1 )[m]\u03c6 coincide (i.e. \u03c6(h\u0303)[m] = (g2\u22121g3 g1 )[m]). Thus we compute TG\nm (h\u0303[m], g1 [m]) =\n\u22121\n\u22121\ng3 [m]g1 [m]((g2 g3 g1 )[m]) = g2 [m].\n\u0003\nThere exist upper bounds of nG\nD which depend only on r and on the closed\nembedding homomorphism G \u0592\u2192 GL M , cf. [Va1, Main Thm. A and Example\n3.1.5]. The following consequences of Lemma 6 and of the existence of such\nupper bounds of nG\nD are shown similarly to Corollary 4 (a) to (c).\n28\n\n\fCorollary 7 The following three properties hold:\nG\nG\n(a) The projective limit O\u221e\n:= proj.lim.m\u2192\u221e Om\nin the category of ringed\nspaces is also a projective limit in the category of k-schemes and it is a\nG\nreduced, quasi-compact, locally closed subscheme of D\u221e\nwhose k-valued points\nG\nG\nG\nG\nform one orbit of the action T\u221e (k) : H\u221e (k)\u00d7D\u221e (k) \u2192 D\u221e\n(k) in the category\nG\nG\nof sets. Thus O\u221e is the orbit of 1M \u2208 D\u221e (k) under the action TG\n\u221e.\nG\n(b) The set of orbits of T\u221e is in natural bijection to the set of (representatives of ) inner isomorphism classes of triples of the form (M, g\u03c6, \u03b8g, G)\nwith g \u2208 G(W (k)).\n(c) If K is an algebraically closed field that contains k, then we have\nGW (K)\nnDK\n= nG\nD.\n\nWe note that the proof of Corollary 7 (b) does not require the use of the\nwell positioned property mentioned in the proof of Lemma 6.\nThe generalizations of Theorems 2, 3, and 4 to the relative context proG\nvided by (M, \u03c6, G) is automatic. For instance, if Tm+1\nis the reduced group of\nG\n\u22121\nG\nG\nG\n(\u03c1m+1 ) (Sm ) and if Vm+1 is the inverse image of the point 1M [m] \u2208 Om\n(k)\nG\nG\nG\nunder the epimorphism \u03c4m+1 : Dm+1 \u0589 Dm , then the set of orbits of the\nG\naction TG\nm+1 that map onto Om is in a natural bijection to the set of orbits\nG\nG\nG\nof the action Tm+1 \u00d7k Vm+1 \u2192 Vm+1\ninduced via restriction by TG\nm+1 . MoreG,0\ndG\nG\nover, Vm+1 is isomorphic to Ak , Tm+1 is unipotent, we have a short exact\nG\nG\nsequence 1 \u2192 GdaG \u2192 Tm+1\n\u2192 Cm+1\n\u2192 1, etc. Thus in all that follows we\nwill concentrate on the generalization of Theorem 1 and of its corollaries.\nLemma 7 We assume that nD = 0 (i.e. D is either \u00e9tale or of multiplicative type). Then we have nG\nD \u2208 {0, 1}. If moreover the special fibre Gk is\nG\nconnected, then we have nD = 0.\nProof: As nD = 0, the image of \u03bc is either trivial or equal to the center\nof GL M . Thus W = GL M/pM , \u03bc centralizes G, and we have W G = Gk .\nLet \u03c3\u03c6 := \u03c6\u03bc(p) : M \u2192 M; it is a \u03c3-linear automorphism of M which\nnormalizes G and which acts on G(B(k)) in the same way as \u03c6. The Zp module MZp := {x \u2208 M|\u03c3\u03c6 (x) = x} is a Zp structure of M (i.e. we have\nM = W (k) \u2297Zp MZp ) and gZp := {x \u2208 g|\u03c3\u03c6 (x) = x} = g \u2229 End(MZp ) is a\nZp structure of g. Thus G is the pull-back to Spec W (k) of a smooth closed\nsubgroup scheme GZp of GL MZp , cf. [Va4, Prop. 3.2].\nIf Gk is (resp. is not) connected, let g \u2208 G(W (k)) (resp. let g \u2208\nKer(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(k))). We will show that there exist an inner isomorphism\n29\n\n\fbetween (M, g\u03c6, G) and (M, \u03c6, G). For this let s be a positive integer such\nthat s \u2265 max{2, nG\nD }. The affine group Ks := Ws (G) (resp. the kernel Ks of\nthe natural restriction homomorphism Ws (G) \u2192 W1 (G)) over k is connected\nand smooth, cf. Subsubsection 3.1.3. The endomorphism of Ks induced naturally by \u03c3\u03c6 is the usual Frobenius endomorphism \u03c3s of Ks with respect to\nthe Fp -form Ks,Fp of Ks defined by Ws (GZp ) (resp. by the kernel of the natural restriction homomorphism Ws (GZp ) \u2192 W1 (GZp )); here the Ws and W1\nfunctors are applied over Zp . A classical theorem of Lang implies that there\nexists an element h[s] \u2208 Ks (k) \u2282 G(Ws (k)) such that g[s] = h[s]\u22121 \u03c3s (h[s]).\nIf h \u2208 G(W (k)) lifts h[s], then we get that g1 := hg\u03c6(h\u22121 ) \u2208 G(W (k))\nis such that g1 [s] = 1M [s] and hg\u03c6 = hg\u03c6(h\u22121 )\u03c6h = g1 \u03c6h. From this\nand the definition of nG\nD \u2264 s, we get that there exists h1 \u2208 G(W (k)) such\nthat h1 g1 \u03c6 = \u03c6h1 . We conclude that h1 h is an inner isomorphism between\nG\n(M, g\u03c6, G) and (M, \u03c6, G). Thus we have nG\n\u0003\nD = 0 (resp. nD \u2264 1).\nProposition 2 The following five properties hold:\nG\n(a) The natural homomorphism \u03b9G\nAut(D[pm ])G\nm : Sm \u2192 Aut\ncrys induced by \u03b9m\nG\nG\nm G\nAut\ngives an isomorphism \u03b9m (k) : Sm (k) \u2192 Aut(D[p ])crys (k).\nG\n(b) The sequence (\u03b3D\n(i))i\u2208N is increasing.\nG\n(c) The subsequence (\u03b3D\n(i))i\u2265nGD is constant.\nG\nG\nG\nG\n(d) We assume that nG\nD \u2265 2. Then we have \u03b3D (nD \u2212 1) < \u03b3D (nD ).\n(e) The connected smooth affine groups Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G,0\nAut(D[pm ])G,0\nred and Aut\ncrys,red\nare unipotent.\n\nProof: Due to the axiom (AX2), \u03c3\u03c6 := \u03c6\u03bc(p) : M \u2192 M is a \u03c3-linear\nautomorphism of M which normalizes G. Based on this, the argument for\n(a) is the same as the one in the proof of [Va2, Cor. 4.3 (b)] (see second\nparagraph of [Va2, p. 635]). As a second proof of (a), we first remark that\nG\n\u03b9G\nm (k) is injective as \u03b9m (k) is so; the surjectivity of \u03b9m (k) follows directly from\nthe proof of Lemma 6 applied with g1 [m] = g2 [m] = 1M [m].\nBased on (a) we get:\nG\nG\nG\nAut\n\u03b3D\n(m) = dim(Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G\ncrys ) = dim(Cm ) = mdG \u2212 dim(Om ).\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\n)+dim(Om\n). As the fibres of \u03c4m+1\nThus \u03b3D\n(m+1)\u2212\u03b3D\n(m) = dG \u2212dim(Om+1\nG\nG\n\u2192 Om\ninduced by\nare isomorphic to AdkG , the faithfully flat morphism Om+1\nG\nG\nG\n\u03c4m+1 has fibres of dimension at most dG . Thus dim(Om+1 ) \u2212 dim(Om\n) \u2264 dG ,\nG\nG\nG\nG\ni.e. \u03b3D (m + 1) \u2212 \u03b3D (m) \u2265 0. As \u03b3D (1) \u2265 0 = \u03b3D (0), we get that (b) holds.\n\n30\n\n\fG\nG\nG\nIf nG\nD = 0, then Om = Dm has dimension mdG and thus \u03b3D (m) = 0. As\nG\n= 0, we conclude that (c) holds if nD = 0. Thus to prove (c) we can\nG\nG\nassume that nG\nD \u2265 1. If m \u2265 nD , then from the very definition of nD we get\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nthat Om+1\n= (\u03c4m+1\n)\u22121 (Om\n). This implies that dim(Om+1\n) = dim(Om\n) + dG ,\nG\nG\ni.e. \u03b3D (m + 1) \u2212 \u03b3D (m) = 0. Thus (c) holds.\nG\nG\nG\nTo prove (d), it suffices to show that the equality \u03b3D\n(nG\nD \u2212 1) = \u03b3D (nD )\nleads to a contradiction. This equality implies that dim(OnGG ) = dG +\nG\n\u03b3D\n(0)\n\nD\n\ndim(OnGG \u22121 ). Therefore all fibres of the faithfully flat morphism OnGG \u2192\nD\n\nD\n\nOnGG \u22121 have dimension dG and thus, being closed subschemes of AdkG , are\nD\n\nisomorphic to AdkG . Thus OnGG = (\u03c4nGG )\u22121 (OnGG \u22121 ). This means that if\nD\nD\nD\ng\u0303 \u2208 Ker(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(WnGD \u22121 (k))), then (M, g\u0303\u03c6, G) is inner isomorphic\nto a triple of the form (M, g\u03031 \u03c6, G) with g\u03031 \u2208 Ker(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(WnGD (k)))\nand therefore (cf. definition of nG\nD ) it is inner isomorphic to (M, \u03c6, G). Thus\nG\nG\nwe have nD \u2264 nD \u2212 1. Contradiction. Therefore (d) holds.\nPart (e) follows from the fact that Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G,0\nAut(D[pm ])G,0\nred and Aut\ncrys,red\nare subgroups of the unipotent groups Aut\nAut(D[pm ])0red and Aut\nAut(D[pm ])0crys,red\n(respectively), cf.

Let End\nEnd(D[pl ])gcrys := End\nEnd(D[pl ])crys \u2229\nWl (g), the intersection being taken inside Wl (End(M)). The crystalline\nDieudonn\u00e9 functor defines a homomorphism D : End\nEnd(D[pl ]) \u2192 End\nEnd(D[pl ])crys\nwhich induces a bijection at the level of k-valued points. Let End\nEnd(D[pl ])g :=\nEnd\nD\u22121 (End\nEnd(D[pl ])gcrys ). The k-valued points of End\nEnd(D[pl ])g are those endomorphisms of D[pl ] whose crystalline realizations belong to g/pl g \u2282 End(M/pl M).\nThe homomorphism End\nEnd(D[pl ])g \u2192 End\nEnd(D[pl ])gcrys which is the natural\nrestriction of D, induces a bijection at the level of k-valued points.

Then the image of the restriction homomorphism sG\nAut(D[pl ])G \u2192 Aut\nAut(D[pi ])G (or sG\nAut(D[pl ])G\ncrys \u2192\nl,i : Aut\nl,i,crys : Aut\ni G\nG\nAut\nAut(D[p ])crys) is finite if and only if l \u2212 i \u2265 nD .\n(g) If i \u2265 2nG\nAut(D[pi ])G,0\nD is a positive integer, then the unipotent groups Aut\nred\nand Aut\nAut(D[pi ])G,0\ncrys,red are commutative.\nProof: To prove (a) we distinguish three cases as follows.\nWe assume that (i) holds and 1M \u2208 g (i.e. g is a W (k)-subalgebra of\nEnd(M)). In this case Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G\nEnd(D[pm ])gcrys\ncrys is an open subscheme of End\nand thus (a) holds.\nWe assume that (i) holds and 1M \u2208\n/ g. Then Aut\nAut(D[pm ])G\ncrys is isomorphic\nto an open subscheme of End\nEnd(D[pm ])gcrys via the morphism which at the\nlevel of k-valued points maps an automorphism g[m] to the endomorphism\ng[m] \u2212 1M [m]. Thus (a) holds.\nWe assume that (ii) holds. To check that (a) holds, we can assume l > 0.\nThe isomorphism U induces naturally a Cayley transform Ul : OGl \u2192 Ogl\nwhich is an isomorphism between the non-empty open subscheme OGl of\nGWl (k) formed by points which do not have the eigenvalue \u22121 and the nonempty open subscheme Ogl of g/pl g formed by points which do not have the\neigenvalue \u22121.\nThe association \u22c4 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 \u22c4)(1 + \u22c4)\u22121 maps endomorphisms of some pullback of D[pl ] or of some scalar extension of (M/pl M, \u03c6l , \u03b8l ) to endomorphisms of the same pull-back of D[pl ] or of the same scalar extension of\n(M/pl M, \u03c6l , \u03b8l ). Therefore Ul induces an isomorphism\nUl : OAut\nOAut(D[pl ])G\nOEnd(D[pl ])gcrys\ncrys \u2192 OEnd\nfrom a suitable non-empty open subscheme OAut\nOAut(D[pl ])G\nAut(D[pl ])G\ncrys of Aut\ncrys\nto a suitable non-empty open subscheme OEnd\nOEnd(D[pl ])gcrys of End\nEnd(D[pl ])gcrys .\nAut\nEnd\nThus dim(Aut\nAut(D[pl ])G\nEnd(D[pl ])gcrys ). Therefore (a) holds.\ncrys ) = dim(End\nBased on the property 5.2 (i) and on (a), the proofs of (b) and (c) are\nthe same as the proofs of Theorem 1 (a) and (b) (the roles of End\nEnd(D[pm ]),\nm\nm g\nm G\nAut\nAut(D[p ]), and Tm being replaced by End\nEnd(D[p ]) , Aut\nAut(D[p ]) , and TG\nm ).\nIf (i) holds, then Gk is the group scheme of invertible elements of 1M/pM +\ng/pg and thus it is connected. Thus to prove (d) we can use the fact that if\n33\n\n\fnD = 0, then Gk is connected. If nD = 0, then nG\nD = 0 by Lemma 7. Thus\nG\nto prove (d) we can assume that min{nD , nD } > 0. Let l := nD + 1 \u2265 2.\ng\ng\nWe have \u03b3D\n(l) = \u03b3D\n(l \u2212 1), cf. property 5.2 (ii). From this and (a) we get\nG\nG\n\u03b3D (l) = \u03b3D (l \u2212 1). From this and (b) we get that l = nD + 1 \u2265 nG\nD + 1. Thus\n(d) holds.\nBased on (a) to (c), part (e) follows from the property 5.2 (i).\nPart (f) follows from (e) via the three cases considered in the proof of\n(a). For instance, if the condition (ii) holds, then the existence of Ul :\ng\nOAut\nOAut(D[pl ])G\nOEnd(D[pl ])gcrys implies that rl,i,crys\nhas finite image if\ncrys \u2192 OEnd\nG\nand only if sl,i,crys has finite image. Thus indeed (e) implies (f).\nThe argument that Aut\nAut(D[pi ])G,0\nAut(D[pi ])G,0\nred (and thus also Aut\ncrys,red ) is comG\nmutative if i \u2265 max{1, 2nD } is the same as the one for Corollary 3 (d). Thus\n(g) holds.\n\u0003\n\n5.3\n\nThe invariant \u03c5D , exponentials, and logarithms\n\nIn order to obtain some variants of Theorem 6, we will introduce new inG\nvariants \u03c5D and \u03c5D\n. The connected smooth affine group Aut\nAut(D[p])0crys,red is\nunipotent, cf. Theorem 5 (a) and (b). Thus Aut\nAut(D[p])0crys,red is a subgroup\nof the unipotent radical of some Borel subgroup of GL M/pM . This implies\nthat there exists a smallest non-negative integer \u03c5D with the property that\nfor each g[1] \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[p])0crys (k), we have (g[1] \u2212 1M [1])\u03c5D = 0. We call \u03c5D as\nthe unipotent number of D. We recall that r is the height of D (i.e. the rank\nof M). We have \u03c5D \u2208 {0, . . . , r}. From Corollary 6 (b) we get:\n(i) For each element e[1] \u2208 End\nEnd(D[p])0crys (k) we have e[1]\u03c5D = 0.\nG\nLet \u03c5D\nbe the smallest non-negative integer with the property that for\ng,0\neach g[1] \u2208 Aut\nAut(D[p])G,0\nEnd(D[p])crys\n(k) we have (g[1] \u2212\ncrys (k) and each e[1] \u2208 End\nG\nG\n\u03c5D\n\u03c5D\nG\n1M [1]) = 0 and e[1] = 0 as elements of End(M/pM).

Therefore the\nstatement (a) of Theorem 6 holds.\n\u0003\n\n5.4\n\nRemarks\n\nWe end this section with three remarks.\n(a) Subsubsections 3.1.2 and 3.2.5 can be as well adapted to the relative\ncontext provided by G. For instance, the group scheme over Spec W (k)\ndefined by the intersection Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8)G := Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8) \u2229 (G(\u03c3) \u00d7W (k) G) taken\ninside GL M (\u03c3) \u00d7W (k) GL M , is naturally isomorphic to (H\u0303G )(\u03c3) . One ends up\nG,(\u03c3)\nG,\u2032: G,\u2032\nG,\u2032\nG,\u2032\nwith an action Tm\nHm \u00d7k Dm\n\u2192 Dm\nisomorphic to the action Tm .\ng\n(b) Referring to Properties 5.3 (iv) and (v), their isomorphisms \u03a9G\nm \u2192 \u03a9m\nm G,0\nm g,0\nand Aut\nAut(D[p ])crys,red \u2192 End\nEnd(D[p ])crys,red are based on the closed subgroup\nscheme G of GL M . One gets variants of these isomorphisms working with\neither the closed subgroup scheme \u03c6\u22121 G\u03c6 of GL\u03c6\u22121 (M ) or the closed subgroup scheme H\u0303G of GLM,\u03c6\u22121 (M ) or the closed subgroup scheme Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8)G\nof GLM (\u03c3) \u00d7W (k) GLM . For instance, working with H\u0303G , the role played by\n36\n\n\fG\nAut\nAut(D[pm ])crys,red is played by Cm\nand the role played by End\nEnd(D[pm ])crys,red\nis played by the reduced closed subgroup scheme of Wm (Lie(H\u0303G )) whose\nk-valued points are elements em \u2208 Lie(H\u0303G )/pm Lie(H\u0303G ) which have a lift\ne \u2208 Lie(H\u0303G ) such that we have \u03c6(e) \u2212 e \u2208 pm g (here we view Lie(H\u0303G ) as\na Lie subalgebra of g via Lie(P\u0303 G )). Moreover, all these isomorphisms are\ncompatible with the different isomorphisms and homomorphisms between\nthe four groups G, \u03c6\u22121 G\u03c6, H\u0303G , Aut\nAut(\u03c6, \u03b8)G , and their pull-backs via \u03c3, as\none can easily check based on Fact 5 of Appendix B.\n(c) Axiom (AX2) was used only in the proofs of Lemmas 5 and 6 and\nProposition 2 (a). Thus all the results of this section continue to hold even\nif the axiom (AX2) is replaced by the following weaker version of it.\n\n(AX2\u2032) The intersection W G = Gk \u2229 W is a smooth subgroup of Gk and\nGB(k) is well positioned with respect to (M, \u03c6\u22121 (M)).\n\n6\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we exemplify the results of Section 5 through three simple\nsituations that are of special interest. Expressions of the form \u03c61 and \u03b81 will\nhave a meaning different from the one before Subsection 3.1.\n\n6.1\n\nThe homomorphism context\n\nLet D1 and D2 be two p-divisible groups over k.

It is easy to see that axioms (AX1)\nand (AX2) hold for the triple (M, \u03c6, G) (in connection to (AX2) one has to\ntake M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 such that we have F s = (F s \u2229 M1 ) \u2295 (F s \u2229 M2 ) for each\ns \u2208 {0, 1}).

Based on this one\neasily checks that nD1 ,D2 = nG\nD (to be compared with [Va1, Lemma 3.2.2]).\ni\nFor i \u2208 N let Hom\nHom(D1 [p ], D2 [pi ]) be the group scheme over k of homoHom\nmorphisms from D1 [pi ] to D2 [pi ].

Based on this one easily checks that nF = nG\nD (to be\ncompared with [Va1, Lemma 3.2.2]).\nFor i \u2208 N, let Aut F (D[pi ]) (resp.

Each Aut F (D[pi ]) is an open (as well as\nAutF (D[pi ])) =\nclosed) subscheme of End F (D[pi ]) and thus we can define \u03b3F (i) := dim(Aut\ni\ni\ni\nG\nEndF (D[p ])). It is easy to see that Aut F (D[p ])red = Aut\ndim(End\nAut(D[p ])red and\ni\ni g\nG\nEnd F (D[p ])red = End\nEnd(D[p ])red . Thus \u03b3F (i) = \u03b3D (i). From Theorem 6 and\nProposition 2 (c) we get that:\n\n(i) If nF > 0, then we have \u03b3F (1) < \u03b3F (2) < * * * < \u03b3F (nF ).\n(ii) The sequence (\u03b3F (i + 1) \u2212 \u03b3F (i))i\u2208N is a decreasing sequence in N and\nfor i \u2265 nF we have \u03b3F (i) = \u03b3F (nF ). Moreover we have nF \u2264 nD .\n(iii) For integers l > i > 0, the image of the restriction homomorphism\nEnd F (D[pl ]) \u2192 End F (D[pi ]) is finite if and only if l \u2212 i \u2265 nF .\n(iv) If i \u2265 2nF is an integer, then the unipotent group Aut F (D[pi ])0red is\ncommutative.\n\n6.3\n\nThe principally quasi-polarized context\n\nLet D t be the Cartier dual of D. We assume that there exists an isomorphism\n\u03bb : D \u2192 D t such that the perfect bilinear form \u03c8 : M \u00d7 M \u2192 W (k)\nassociated naturally to \u03bb is symmetric (resp. is alternating). If p = 2 and \u03c8\nis symmetric, we also assume that \u03c8 modulo 2 is alternating. We refer to \u03bb\nas a symmetric principal (resp. a principal) quasi-polarization of D.\nWe have c = d > 0. Let G := SO\nSO(q), where q : M \u2192 W (k) is the\nquadratic form defined by the rule q(x) = 12 \u03c8(x, x) (resp. let G := Sp\nSp(M, \u03c8)).\n39\n\n\fThe group scheme G is Gm (resp. is SL 2 ) if d = 1 and it is semisimple if\nd > 1 (see [Va5, Subsect. 3.1 and Prop. 3.4] for the case when p = 2 and \u03c8\nis symmetric). It is easy to see that axioms (AX1) and (AX2) hold for the\ntriple (M, \u03c6, G).\nLet nD,\u03bb be the smallest non-negative integer n for which the following statement holds: if (D \u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) is another p-divisible group of dimension\nd over k equipped with a symmetric principal (resp. with a principal)\nquasi-polarization such that (D \u2032 [pn ], \u03bb\u2032 [pn ]) is inner isomorphic (resp. is isomorphic) to (D[pn ], \u03bb[pn ]), then (D \u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 ) is isomorphic to (D, \u03bb). Here, in\nthe case when \u03c8 is symmetric, by an inner isomorphism (D \u2032 [pn ], \u03bb\u2032 [pn ]) \u2192\n(D[pn ], \u03bb[pn ]) we mean an isomorphism defined at the level of Dieudonn\u00e9\nmodules by an isomorphism (M/pn M, \u03c6n , \u03b8n , qn ) \u2192 (M \u2032 /pn M \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032n , \u03b8\u2032n , qn\u2032 ),\nwhere the left lower indexes n mean reduction modulo pn .\nWe always have nD,\u03bb \u2265 1. We have nG\nD = 0 if and only if d = 1 and\n\u03c8 is symmetric. If nG\n\u2265\n1,\nit\nis\nwell\nknown\nthat nD,\u03bb = nG\nD\nD (if \u03c8 is\nalternating, see [Va2, Example 4.5]; the symmetric case is similar). For\ni \u2208 N, let \u03b3D,\u03bb (i) be the dimension of the group scheme Inn\nInn(D[pi ], \u03bb[pi ])\ni\ni\n(resp. Aut\nAut(D[p ], \u03bb[p ])) of inner automorphisms (resp. of automorphisms) of\ni\n(D[p ], \u03bb[pi ]), where Inn\nInn(D[pi ], \u03bb[pi ]) is some subgroup scheme of Aut\nAut(D[pi ])\nwhose k-valued points are the inner automorphisms defined above. It is easy\nto see that Inn\nInn(D[pi ], \u03bb[pi ])red = Aut\nAut(D[pi ])G\nAut(D[pi ], \u03bb[pi ])red =\nred (resp. Aut\nG\nAut\nAut(D[pi ])G\nred ). Thus \u03b3D,\u03bb (i) = \u03b3D (i).\nIf p > 2, then G admits a Cayley transform of the form g 7\u2192 (1M \u2212g)(1M +\n\u22121\ng) and thus Theorem 6 applies. In particular, for p > 2 and d > 1 (resp.\nfor p > 2) we have nD,\u03bb = nG\nD \u2264 nD . If p = 2 and d > 1 (resp. if p = 2), then\nfrom Proposition 3 (b) we get the weaker fact that nD,\u03bb = nG\nD \u2264 nD + 1.\nIf p > 2 and d > 1 (resp. if p > 2), then from Theorem 6 we also get that:\n(i) We have \u03b3D,\u03bb(1) < \u03b3D,\u03bb (2) < * * * < \u03b3D,\u03bb(nD,\u03bb ).\n(ii) The sequence (\u03b3D,\u03bb(i + 1) \u2212 \u03b3D,\u03bb (i))i\u2208N is a decreasing sequence in N\nand for i \u2265 nD,\u03bb we have \u03b3D,\u03bb(i) = \u03b3D,\u03bb (nD,\u03bb ).\n(iii) For integers l > i > 0, the restriction homomorphism Inn\nInn(D[pl ], \u03bb[pl ])\n\u2192 Inn\nInn(D[pi ], \u03bb[pi ]) (resp.

Let K be the field of fractions\nof R and let \u03c0 be a uniformizer of R. Let k := R/(\u03c0) be the residue field of R.\nLet H = Spec Q be a flat, affine group scheme over Spec R. Let J = Spec Q/I\nbe a closed subgroup scheme of Hk ; thus I is an ideal of Q which contains\nQ\u03c0. Let Q\u2032 be the R-subalgebra of Q[ \u03c01 ] generated by all elements of the form\nx\nwith x \u2208 I; it contains Q. See [BLR, Ch. 3, Sect. 3.2] for dilatations. The\n\u03c0\ndilatation of H centered on J is the flat, affine group scheme H \u2032 = Spec Q\u2032\nover Spec R. One has the following two properties (they follow directly from\nthe very description of Q\u2032 ; see [BLR, Ch. 3, Sect. 3.2, Props. 1, 2, and 3]):\n(i) there exists a homomorphism f : H \u2032 \u2192 H that corresponds to the\nR-monomorphism Q \u0592\u2192 Q\u2032 ;\n(ii) a morphism g : X \u2192 H of flat Spec R-schemes factors through H \u2032\nif and only if the morphism gk : Xk \u2192 Hk factors through J, and the\nfactorization is unique if it exists.\nBy applying (ii) with X a Spec K-scheme, we get that fK is an isomorphism of Spec K-schemes that corresponds to the identity Q[ \u03c01 ] = Q\u2032 [ \u03c01 ]. If\nH and J are smooth, then H \u2032 is also smooth (cf. loc. cit.). If H\u0303 is a flat,\nclosed subgroup scheme of H and if J \u0303 := J \u2229 H\u0303k , then the dilatation H\u0303 \u2032 of\nH\u0303 centered on J \u0303 comes equipped with a homomorphism H\u0303 \u2032 \u2192 H \u2032 (cf. (ii)).\nIt is easy to see (cf. loc. cit.) that:\n(iii) the homomorphism H\u0303 \u2032 \u2192 H \u2032 is a closed embedding.\nLet V be a finite dimensional K-vector space. By an R-lattice of V we\nmean an R-submodule of V generated by a K-basis of V . Let M and M \u2032 be\ntwo lattices of V such that we have \u03c0M \u2032 \u2282 M \u2282 M \u2032 . We consider a direct\nsum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 into free R-modules such that we have\nM \u2032 = \u03c0 \u22121 F 1 \u2295 F 0 . Let \u03bb : Gm \u2192 GL V be the cocharacter defined by the\nrule: t \u2208 Gm (K) fixes F 0 [ \u03c01 ] and acts as the multiplication by t\u22121 on F 1 [ \u03c01 ].\nLet G be a closed subgroup scheme of GL V . Let GM and GM \u2032 be the\nschematic closures of G in GL M and GL M \u2032 (respectively); they are flat,\n\n41\n\n\faffine group schemes over Spec R. Let GM,M \u2032 be the schematic closure of G in\nGLM \u00d7R GLM \u2032 embedded diagonally into the generic fibre of GLM \u00d7R GLM \u2032 .\nExample Suppose G = GLV . Then GM = GLM , GM \u2032 = GLM \u2032 , and we\nclaim that GM,M \u2032 is the group scheme H over Spec R that represents the\nfunctor of automorphisms of the pair of R-linear maps M o\n\n\u03b9\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\nM \u2032 , where\n\n\u03b9 : M \u0592\u2192 M \u2032 is the inclusion. As \u03bb(\u03c0 \u22121 ) maps M \u2032 isomorphically onto M,\nH is isomorphic to the group scheme Aut\nAut(\u03b91 , \u03b92 ) over Spec R that represents\nthe functor of automorphisms of the pair of R-linear maps M o\n\n\u03b91\n\u03b92\n\n/\n\nM , where\n\n\u03b91 : M \u0592\u2192 M and \u03b92 : M \u0592\u2192 M map (x, y) \u2208 F 1 \u2295 F 0 = M to (\u03c0x, y)\nand (x, \u03c0y) (respectively). For a commutative R-algebra S,\u0001 we write an\nS-linear endomorphism of S \u2297R (F 1 \u2295 F 0 ) in the form us vt , where s \u2208\nEnd(S \u2297R F 1 ), t \u2208 Hom(S \u2297R F 0 , S \u2297R F 1 ), u \u2208 Hom(S \u2297R F 1 , S \u2297R F 0 ),\nand v \u2208 End(S \u2297R F 0 ). The subgroup Aut\nAut(\u03b9\n1 ,\u0001\u03b92 )(S) of GL M (S) \u00d7 GL M (S)\n\u0001 s \u03c0t\ns t\nis formed by all pairs of the form ( \u03c0u v , u v ) which are invertible. From\nthis it follows that H is flat (in fact even smooth) and thus it is GM,M \u2032 . The\ndescription of the subgroups Aut\nAut(\u03b91 , \u03b92 )(S) also implies that the following\nthree properties hold:\n(a) the first projection homomorphism Aut\nAut(\u03b91 , \u03b92 ) \u2192 GLM and thus also\nGL M,M \u2032 \u2192 GL M is the dilatation of GL M centered on the parabolic subgroup\nPk of GL M/\u03c0M that normalizes the k-vector subspace \u03c0M \u2032 /\u03c0M = F 1 /\u03c0F 1\nof M/\u03c0M;\n(b) similarly, the second projection homomorphism Aut\nAut(\u03b91 , \u03b92 ) \u2192 GL M\n(resp. GL M,M \u2032 \u2192 GL M \u2032 ) is the dilatation of GL M (resp. of GL M \u2032 ) centered on the parabolic subgroup Pk\u2032 of GL M/\u03c0M (resp. of GL M \u2032 /\u03c0M \u2032 ) that\nnormalizes the k-vector subspace F 0 /\u03c0F 0 of M/\u03c0M (resp. of M \u2032 /\u03c0M \u2032 );\n(c) the special fibre Aut\nAut(\u03b91 , \u03b92 )k (and thus also Hk ) is connected.\nFrom this Example and the property (iii) we get directly that:\nFact 3 In general, the homomorphism GM,M \u2032 \u2192 GM is the dilatation of GM\ncentered on GM,k \u2229Pk and the homomorphism GM,M \u2032 \u2192 GM \u2032 is the dilatation\nof GM \u2032 centered on GM \u2032 ,k \u2229 Pk\u2032 .\nWe also consider the intersection G\u2217M,M \u2032 := (GM \u00d7R GM \u2032 ) \u2229 GL M,M \u2032\ntaken inside GL M \u00d7R GL M \u2032 . We have a closed embedding homomorphism\nh : GM,M \u2032 \u2192 G\u2217M,M \u2032 whose generic fibre is an isomorphism.\n42\n\n\fDefinition 3 We say that G is well positioned with respect to (M, M \u2032 ) if\nGM,M \u2032 = G\u2217M,M \u2032 , i.e. h is an isomorphism (equivalently, G\u2217M,M \u2032 is flat).\nFor n \u2208 N\u2217 let hn := h(R/(\u03c0 n )) : GM,M \u2032 (R/(\u03c0 n )) \u2192 G\u2217M,M \u2032 (R/(\u03c0 n )). If G\nis well positioned with respect to (M, M \u2032 ), then each hn is an isomorphism.\nFact 4 We assume that k is algebraically closed and GM,M \u2032 is smooth. If h1\nand h2 are isomorphisms, then G is well positioned with respect to (M, M \u2032 ).\nProof: By the fiberwise criterion of flatness, it suffices to check that the\nspecial fibre hk : GM,M \u2032 ,k \u2192 G\u2217M,M \u2032,k of h is an isomorphism. Since hk is a\nbijection (as h1 is an isomorphism) and it induces an isomorphism dhk at the\nlevel of Lie algebras (as h2 is an isomorphism), it is a closed embedding with\nsmooth source and target. Thus, hk is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\nProposition 4 If G is normalized by \u03bb, then G is well positioned with respect\nto (M, M \u2032 ).\nProof: We will use the theory of dynamically defined (see [CGP, Sect. 2.1])\nclosed subgroup schemes U\u2217 (\u2212\u03bb), Z\u2217 (\u03bb), and U\u2217 (\u03bb) of \u2217, where \u2217 stands for\nan affine group scheme over either Spec K or Spec R normalized by \u03bb or by\nsome extension of \u03bb to a cocharacter over Spec R. For example, Z\u2217 (\u03bb) is the\nscheme theoretic centralizer of \u03bb (or of some extension of it over Spec R) in\n\u2217, while U\u2217 (\u03bb) and U\u2217 (\u2212\u03bb) are unipotent subgroup schemes of \u2217, which for\n\u2217 = GL V are obtained naturally from the K-vector spaces Hom(F 1 [ \u03c01 ], F 0 [ \u03c01 ])\nand Hom(F 0 [ \u03c01 ], F 1 [ \u03c01 ]) (respectively).\nThe product open embedding UGL V (\u2212\u03bb)\u00d7K ZGL V (\u03bb)\u00d7K UGL V (\u03bb) \u0592\u2192 GL V\ndefines the \"big cell\" of GLV . Its intersection with G is the \"big cell\" CG :=\nUG (\u2212\u03bb) \u00d7K ZG (\u03bb) \u00d7K UG (\u03bb) of G, cf. [CGP, Prop. 2.1.8 and Rm. 2.1.11].\nThe \"big cell\" notion extends to smooth affine group schemes over R (cf.\nloc. cit.) and the special fibre of GL M,M \u2032 lies in the big cell. When we\nconsider the big cell CM \u00d7R CM \u2032 of GL M \u00d7R GL M \u2032 , it is easy to see that\nwe have corresponding decompositions for GM , GM \u2032 , and GM,M \u2032 and thus\nalso for G\u2217M,M \u2032 = (GM \u00d7R GM \u2032 ) \u2229 GL M,M \u2032 . For instance for GM , if CGM is\nthe schematic closure of CG in CM , then the closed embedding morphism\nj : CGM \u0592\u2192 GM \u2229 CM between flat Spec R-schemes is an isomorphism as jK is\nan isomorphism; but CGM is a product UGM (\u2212\u03bb) \u00d7R ZGM (\u03bb) \u00d7R UGM (\u03bb) (as\nits generic fibre CG and CM are such products) and thus we get the product\n43\n\n\fdecomposition GM \u2229 CM = UGM (\u2212\u03bb) \u00d7R ZGM (\u03bb) \u00d7R UGM (\u03bb) into Spec Rschemes which are flat as GM is so. Thus it suffices to check the flatness of\nG\u2217M,M \u2032 for each one of the three factors of its open subscheme big cell.\nThe Z(\u03bb) factor. We have ZG (\u03bb) \u2282 GL F 0 [ 1 ] \u00d7K GL F 1 [ 1 ] . Its schematic\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nclosures in GM and GM \u2032 are ZGM (\u03bb) and ZGM \u2032 (\u03bb) (respectively) and can be\nidentified with the schematic closures of ZG (\u03bb) in ZGL M (\u03bb) = GL F 1 \u00d7R GL F 0\nand ZGL M \u2032 (\u03bb) = GL \u03c0\u22121 F 1 \u00d7R GL F 0 (respectively). As GL F 1 = GL \u03c0\u22121 F 1 ,\nZG\u2217M,M \u2032 (\u03bb) is the intersection of the product of these last schematic closures\nwith the diagonal of ZGL M (\u03bb) \u00d7R ZGL M \u2032 (\u03bb) and this intersection is flat and\ncan be identified with both ZGM (\u03bb) and ZGM \u2032 (\u03bb).\nThe U(\u03bb) factor. We have UGL M (\u03bb) = Hom(F 1 , F 0 ) and UGL M \u2032 (\u03bb) =\nHom(\u03c0 \u22121 F 1 , F 0 ) (here underlying means the group scheme functor associated to a module). Moreover UGL M,M \u2032 (\u03bb) is the graph of the restriction\nhomomorphism \u03c6 : Hom(\u03c0 \u22121 F 1 , F 0 ) \u2192 Hom(F 1 , F 0 ). But \u03c6 sends the\nschematic closure UGM \u2032 (\u03bb) of UG (\u03bb) in Hom(\u03c0 \u22121 F 1 , F 0 ) to the schematic closure UGM (\u03bb) of UG (\u03bb) in Hom(F 1 , F 0). Thus again the intersection UG\u2217M,M \u2032 (\u03bb)\nof the product of these schematic closures with the graph of \u03c6 is flat and in\nfact it is isomorphic to UGM \u2032 (\u03bb).\nThe U(\u2212\u03bb) factor. The argument for this is similar to the one in the\nprevious paragraph and in fact we have UG\u2217M,M \u2032 (\u2212\u03bb) = UGM (\u2212\u03bb).\n\u0003\n\n8\n\nAppendix B: properties of exp and log maps\nfor matrices in p-adic contexts\n\nLet p be a prime. Let K be a field of characteristic 0 complete with respect\nto an ultrametric absolute value | | : K \u2192 R. We extend | | to an absolute\nvalue on an algebraic closure K\u0304 of K, denoted also by | |. We assume that\n1\nthe residue characteristic of K is p and let q := |p| p\u22121 \u2208 (0, 1). Let n \u2208 N\u2217\nand let In be the identity matrix of Mn (K) or Mn (K\u0304). By the norm of a\nmatrix X = (xi,j )1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u2208 Mn (K\u0304) we mean\n||X|| := max{|xi,j ||1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} \u2208 [0, \u221e).\nLet \u03c1(X) (denoted ||X||sp in some papers) be the spectral radius of X, i.e.\nthe maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of X in K\u0304. We\ncan conjugate X to an upper triangular matrix whose entries off the main\n44\n\n\fdiagonal have arbitrarily small absolute values. Thus if \u03c1(X) > 0, then we\ncan conjugate X so that we have ||X|| = \u03c1(X) and if \u03c1(X) = 0, then we\ncan\nX so that its norm is arbitrarily small. The series e1 (X) =\nP\u221e conjugate\nXn\nn=1 n! and exp(X) = In + e1 (X) converge if \u03c1(X) < q and the series\nP\n(\u22121)n\u22121\nl1 (X) = log(In + X) = \u221e\nX n converges if \u03c1(X) < 1. From [Bo,\nn=1\nn\nCh. II, Sect. 8, Prop. 4] and our conjugation statements, we get that e1 and\nl1 define inverse bijections on Bn := {X \u2208 Mn (K)|\u03c1(X) < q}.\nProposition 5 Let G be an algebraic subgroup of GL n,K . Then we have\ninverse bijections {\u03b6 \u2208 Lie(G)|\u03c1(\u03b6) < q} o\n\nexp\n\n/\nlog\n\n{g \u2208 G(K)|\u03c1(g \u2212 In ) < q} .\n\nProof: For \u03b6 \u2208 Mn (K) with \u03c1(\u03b6) < q we have to check that \u03b6 \u2208 Lie(G) if\nand only if exp(\u03b6) \u2208 G(K).\nTo check the only if part, we recall that we have a formal exponential\nexp(T \u03b6) in G(K[[T ]]) (cf. [DGa, Ch. II, Sect. 6, Subsect. 3]). By Subsubsection 3.3 of loc. cit., it is given by the usual exponential series for GL n,K ,\nhence the spectral radius condition gives that exp(T \u03b6) and exp(\u2212T \u03b6) are\nmatrices with coefficients in the ring K{T } of restricted formal power series.\nThus exp(T \u03b6) \u2208 G(K[[T ]]) \u2229 GL n (K{T }) = G(K{T }) and by evaluating at\nT = 1 we get that exp(\u03b6) \u2208 G(K).\nWe now check the if part. We have exp(T \u03b6) \u2208 GL n (K{T }) and it belongs\nto G(K) when evaluated at T = 1 and thus at each T \u2208 Z. Hence every\nequation for G in GL n,K evaluated at exp(T \u03b6) is an element in K{T } with\ninfinitely many zeros in K and thus it is 0, cf. Weierstrass preparation theorem\nfor K{T }. Thus exp(T \u03b6) \u2208 G(K{T }) \u2282 G(K[[T ]]) and by evaluating its\nderivative at T = 0 we get that \u03b6 \u2208 Lie(G).\n\u0003\nRemark Proposition 6 and its proof extend to the case when the residue\nfield of K has characteristic 0 provided we take q = 1.\n\n8.1\n\nApplications to rings of Witt vectors\n\nLet A be a reduced Fp -algebra.

Let Wm (A) := W (A)/V m (W (A)).\nFor X = (xi,j )1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u2208 Mn (W (A)) and l \u2208 N, let \u03c0l (X) = (xl,i,j )1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u2208\nMn (A) be the matrix of the l-th Witt components of the entries of X; thus\n45\n\n\fxi,j = (x0,i,j , x1,i,j , . . .) \u2208 W (A). For s \u2208 N\u2217 , let\n\u03a3s = {X \u2208 Mn (W (A))|\u03c00 (X)s = 0} and \u03a31,s = V (\u03a3s ).\nFor a \u2208 N\u2217 we have a sequence of inclusions\n\u03a31,1 \u2282 \u03a31,2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 \u03a31,n = \u03a31,n+a \u2282 \u03a31 \u2282 \u03a32 \u2282 * * * \u2282 \u03a3n = \u03a3n+a .\nMoreover, \u03a31 = V (Mn (W (A))) and \u03a31,1 = V 2 (Mn (W (A))).\nAs A is reduced, W (A) is torsion free and thus expressions of the form dy\nare uniquely determined if they make sense (here y \u2208 W (A) and d \u2208 N\u2217 ).\nThe V -adic filtration is compatible with the multiplication, i.e. we have\nV a (W (A))V b (W (A)) \u2282 V a+b (W (A)) for all a, b \u2208 N. Also we recall that\nV (x1 ) * * * V (xd ) = pd\u22121 V (x1 * * * xd ) for all d \u2208 N\u2217 and x1 , . . . , xd \u2208 W (A).\nMoreover, as V is additive, these properties extend to matrices in Mn (W (A)).\nProposition 6 Let \u03a3 be either \u03a3s for p > 2 and 1 \u2264 s \u2264 p\u22121\nor \u03a31,t for p\n2\narbitrary and t \u2208 N\u2217 . Then the following three properties hold:\n(a) For v \u2208 N\u2217 the rule X 7\u2192\n\nXv\nv!\n\nsends \u03a3 to \u03a3.\nP\nP\u221e (\u22121)v\u22121 v\n\u266dv\n(b) The partial sums of the series e1 (\u266d) = \u221e\nand\nl\n(\u266d)\n=\n\u266d\n1\nv=1 v!\nv=1\nv\nsend \u03a3 to \u03a3 and converge V -adically to maps e1 : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3 and l1 : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\nwhich are inverse to each other.\n(c) For l \u2208 N the entries of \u03c0l (e1 (X)) and \u03c0l (l1 (X)) are polynomials\nwith coefficients in Fp in the entries of \u03c0l\u0303 (X) with  \u0303l \u2208 {0, . . . , l}. Thus if\n\u03a3[m] := Im(\u03a3 \u2192 Mn (Wm (A))), then e1 and l1 induce inverse bijections\n\u03a3[m] o\n\ne1\nl1\n\n/\n\n\u03a3[m] which commute with the conjugation by GLn (Wm (A)).\nv\n\nv\u22121\n\nProof: We have V (X)\n= p v! V (X v ) and ordp (v!) \u2264 v\u22121\nand thus the rule\nv!\np\u22121\nv\nX\nX 7\u2192 v! sends \u03a31 to \u03a31 and \u03a31,t is preserved. If v \u2265 td (resp. v \u2265 td + 1),\nv\nthen the rule X 7\u2192 Xv! sends \u03a31,t to V d (\u03a31 ) (resp. to V d (\u03a31,t )).\np\u22121\nIf p > 2 and X \u2208 \u03a3s with s \u2264 p\u22121\n, we can write X 2 = V (Y ) and thus\n2\nv\np\u22121\nX p\u22121\n= V (Y 2 ) \u2208 \u03a3s ; as Tv! is cT a ( T p )b for some c \u2208 Z(p) , a \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1},\np\nv\nv\nand b \u2208 N, we get that Xv! \u2208 \u03a3s . If v \u2265 (p \u2212 1)(d + 1), then the rule X 7\u2192 Xv!\nsends \u03a3s to V d (\u03a31 ). Thus (a) and the first part of (b) hold.\nThe fact that e1 is inverse to l1 can be reduced to the case when A is\na perfect field k in which case Proposition 5 applies with K = W (k)[ 1p ],\n46\n\n\f1\n\nGLn,K )|\u03c1(X) \u2264 |p| s } \u2282 Bn , and \u03a31,t \u2282 {X \u2208\n\u03a3s \u2282 {X \u2208 Mn (K) = Lie(GL\nt+1\nGLn,K )|\u03c1(X) \u2264 |p| t } \u2282 Bn . Thus the second part of (b) also\nMn (K) = Lie(GL\nv\nholds. Part (c) follows directly from the above facts on X 7\u2192 Xv! .\n\u0003\nLet P be a finitely generated, projective Wm (A)-module. If P is free\nof rank n, we can speak about \u03a3P \u2282 End(P ) and about inverse bijections\n\u03a3P o\n\ne1\nl1\n\n/\n\n\u03a3P which can be identified with \u03a3[m] o\n\ne1\nl1\n\n/\n\n\u03a3[m] with respect to each\n\nisomorphism P \u2192 Wm (A)n of Wm (A)-modules. These inverse bijections\nmake sense for all P (without assuming their freeness) via a natural sheafification process (there exists a finite open cover Spec A = \u222aui=1 Spec Afi such\nthat Wm (Afi ) \u2297Wm (A) P is free for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , u}; here each fi \u2208 A).\nFact 5 (a) If P is a finitely generated, projective Wm (A)-module and Q is\na direct summand of P and if x \u2208 \u03a3P is such that x(Q) \u2282 Q, then we have\ne1 (x)(Q) \u2282 Q and l1 (x)(Q) \u2282 Q.\n(b) If \u03c6 : P1 \u2192 P2 is a Wm (A)-linear map between finitely generated,\nprojective Wm (A)-modules and if x1 \u2208 \u03a3P1 and x2 \u2208 \u03a3P2 are such that x2 \u25e6\u03c6 =\n\u03c6 \u25e6 x1 , then we have e1 (x2 ) \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 e1 (x1 ) and l1 (x2 ) \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 l1 (x1 ).\nProof: Locally in the Zariski topology of Spec A, to prove (a) we can assume\nthat P is free and Q is generated by a subset of a Wm (A)-basis for P . It\nis clear from the definitions\n\u0001 that e1 and l1 preserve block upper triangular\nmatrices of the form \u22c60 \u22c6\u22c6 and therefore (a) holds. Part (b) follows from (a)\napplied to the direct summand of P1 \u2295 P2 which is the graph of \u03c6.\n\u0003\n\n8.2\n\nThe perfect field case\n\nLet now A be a perfect field k of characteristic p. Let B(k) := W (k)[ p1 ].\nLet M be a free W (k)-module of finite rank. For x \u2208 End(M), let x\u0304 \u2208\nEnd(M/pM) be its reduction modulo p. Let G be a flat, closed subgroup\nscheme of GL M . Let g := Lie(GB(k) ) \u2229 End(M); thus g/pm g embeds in\nEnd(M/pm M) for every m \u2208 N\u2217 . We define \u03a3 subsets \u03a3(M) of End(M) via\nthe rules: if \u03a3 = \u03a3s , then \u03a3(M) := {x \u2208 End(M)|x\u0304s = 0} and if \u03a3 = \u03a31,t ,\nthen \u03a3(M) := p{x \u2208 End(M)|x\u0304t = 0}.\nProposition 7 (a) For every \u03a3 as in Proposition 6, the exp and log induce\ninverse bijections g \u2229 \u03a3(M) \u21c4 {g \u2208 G(W (k))|g \u2212 1M \u2208 \u03a3(M)} which in\nturn induce for each m \u2208 N\u2217 inverse bijections between the image \u03a3g [m] of\n47\n\n\fg \u2229 \u03a3(M) in g/pm g and the image \u03a3G [m] of {g \u2208 G(W (k))|g \u2212 1M \u2208 \u03a3(M)}\nin G(Wm (k)).\n(b) If (M, \u03c6, \u03b8) is the Dieudonn\u00e9 module of a p-divisible group D over k\n(thus \u03c6 : W (k) \u2297F,W (k) M \u2192 M and \u03b8 : M \u2192 W (k) \u2297F,W (k) M are W (k)linear maps such that \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b8 and \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03c6 are the multiplication by p) and if em \u2208\n\u03a3g [m] is the crystalline realization of an endomorphism of D[pm ] (i.e. is an\nendomorphism of (M, \u03c6, \u03b8) modulo pm ), then exp(em ) and log(1M/pm M + em )\nare crystalline realizations of endomorphisms of D[pm ].\nProof: As V (W (k)) = pW (k), part (a) follows from Propositions 5 and 6.\nPart (b) follows from Fact 5 (b) applied to the reductions modulo pm of \u03c6\nand \u03b8.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgments.
