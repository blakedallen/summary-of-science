The proof is based on\nthe linking theorem in combination with periodic approximations.\nMathematics subject classification: 35Q55, 35Q51, 39A12, 39A70,\n78A40\n\n0\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we consider spatially localized standing waves for the discrete\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (DNLS)\ni\u03c8\u0307n = \u2212\u2206\u03c8n + \u03b5n \u03c8n \u2212 \u03c3\u03c7n |\u03c8n |2 \u03c8n ,\n\nn \u2208 Z,\n\n(0.1)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = \u00b11,\n\u2206\u03c8n = (\u03c8n+1 + \u03c8n\u22121 \u2212 2\u03c8n )\nis the discrete Laplacian in one spatial dimension and given sequences \u03b5n and\n\u03c7n are assumed to be N -periodic in n, i. e. \u03b5n+N = \u03b5n and \u03c7n+N = \u03c7n .\nSuch solutions are often called intrinsic localized modes or breathers, but in the\ncase under consideration we prefer the name \"gap solitons\" due to the obvious\nanalogy with gap solitons in photonic crystals (see, e. g. [1, 4, 15]).\nMaking use the standing wave Ansatz\n\u03c8n = un exp(i\u03c9t),\nwhere un is a real valued sequence and \u03c9 \u2208 R, we arrive at the equation\n\u2212\u2206un + \u03b5n un \u2212 \u03c9un = \u03c3\u03c7n |un |2 un .\n\n1\n\n(0.2)\n\n\fWe impose the following boundary condition at infinity:\nlim un = 0,\n\nn\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\n(0.3)\n\nand we are looking for nontrivial solutions, i. e. solutions that are not equal to\n0 identically.\nActually, we consider a more general equation\nLun \u2212 \u03c9un = \u03c3\u03c7n |un |2 un\n\n(0.4)\n\nwith the same boundary condition (0.3). Here L is a second order difference\noperator\nLun = an un+1 + an\u22121 un\u22121 + bn un\nwhere an and bn are real valued N -periodic sequences. The operator L can be\nrepresented in the form\nLun = \u2212(\u2202 \u2217 an \u2202)fn + (an\u22121 + an + bn )un ,\nwhere\n\u2202 \u2217 un = un\u22121 \u2212 un .\n\n\u2202un = un+1 \u2212 un ,\n\nWhen an \u2261 1 and bn = \u22122 + \u03b5n , we obtain equation (0.2).\nWe consider equation (0.4) as a nonlinear equation in the space l2 of twosided infinite sequences. Note that every element of l2 automatically satisfies\n(0.3).\nThe operator L is a bounded and self-adjoint operator in l2 . Its spectrum\n\u03c3(L) has a band structure, i. e. \u03c3(L) is a union of a finite number of closed\nintervals (see, e. g., [25]). The complement R \\ \u03c3(L) consists of a finite number\nof open intervals called spectral gaps. Two of them are semi-infinite. We fix\none such gap and denote it by (\u03b1, \u03b2).\nOur main result is the following\nTheorem 0.1 Suppose that \u03c7n > 0 and \u03c9 \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2). If either \u03c3 = +1 and\n\u03b2 6= +\u221e, or \u03c3 = \u22121 and \u03b1 6= \u2212\u221e, then equation (0.4) has a nontrivial solution\nu \u2208 l2 and, moreover, the solution u decays exponentially at infinity:\n|un | \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b3|n| ,\n\nn \u2208 Z,\n\nwith some C > 0 and \u03b3 > 0. If either \u03c3 = +1 and \u03b2 = +\u221e, or \u03c3 = \u22121 and\n\u03b1 = \u2212\u221e, then there is no nontrivial solution in l2 .\nThe proof contained in Sections 1\u20135 is variational. Its idea is borrowed from\n[17] and based on so-called periodic approximations. In what follows we consider\nthe case \u03c3 = +1. The other case reduces to the previous one if we replace L by\n\u2212L and \u03c9 by \u2212\u03c9.\n\n2\n\n\f1\n\nVariational setting\n\nOn the Hilbert space E = l2 , we consider the functional\n+\u221e\n1\n1 X\nJ(u) = (Lu \u2212 \u03c9u, u) \u2212\n\u03c7n u4n ,\n2\n4 n=\u2212\u221e\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere (*, *) is l2 inner product. The corresponding norm in E is denoted by\nk * k. The functional J is a well-defined C 1 functional on E and equation (0.4) is\neasily recognized as the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation for J (remind\nthat \u03c3 = +1). Thus, we are looking for nonzero critical points of J.\nFix an integer k > 0 and denote by Ek the space of all kN -periodic sequences.\nThis is a kN -dimensional Hilbert space endowed with the inner product\n(u, v)k =\n\nkN\n\u22121\nX\n\nu, v \u2208 Ek ,\n\nun vn ,\n\nn=0\n\nand corresponding norm k * kk . On the space Ek we consider the functional\nJk (u) =\n\nkN \u22121\n1 X\n1\n(Lu \u2212 \u03c9u, u)k \u2212\n\u03c7n u4n .\n2\n4 n=0\n\n(1.2)\n\nDue to the periodicity of coefficients the operator L acts in Ek . Critical points\nof Jk are exactly kN -periodic solutions of equation (0.4) with \u03c3 = +1.\nFor gradients of J and Jk we have the following formulas:\n+\u221e\nX\n\u0001\n\u2207J(u), v = (Lu \u2212 \u03c9u, v) \u2212\n\u03c7n u3n vn ,\n\nv \u2208 E,\n\n(1.3)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nand\n\nkN\n\u22121\nX\n\u0001\n\u2207Jk (u), v = (Lk u \u2212 \u03c9u, v)k \u2212\n\u03c7n u3n vn ,\n\nv \u2208 E.\n\n(1.4)\n\nn=0\n\nWe denote by Lk the operator L acting in Ek . From the spectral theory\nof difference (Jacobi) operators (see, e. g., [25]) it follows immediately that\n\u03c3(Lk ) \u2282 \u03c3(L) and, hence, kLk k \u2264 kLk.\nLet Ek+ (respectively, Ek\u2212 ) be the positive (respectively, negative) spectral\nsubspace of the operator Lk \u2212 \u03c9 in Ek . Similarly, we introduce the positive and\nnegative spectral subspaces E + \u2282 E and E \u2212 \u2282 E, respectively, for the operator\nL \u2212 \u03c9. Let\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b4 = min |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9|, |\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c9|\nbe the distance from \u03c9 to the spectrum \u03c3(L). Then\n\u00b1(Lu \u2212 \u03c9u, u) \u2265 \u03b4kuk2 ,\nand\n\u00b1(Lk u \u2212 \u03c9u, u)k \u2265 \u03b4kuk2k ,\n\nu \u2208 E\u00b1,\nu \u2208 Ek\u00b1 .\n\nNow we are ready to prove the nonexistence part of Theorem 0.1.\n3\n\n(1.5)\n(1.6)\n\n\fProposition 1.1 Suppose that \u03b2 = +\u221e. Then the only critical point of J\n(respectively, Jk ) is the origin of the space E (respectively, Ek ).\nProof. We consider the case of J, the remaining case being similar.\nLet u \u2208 E be a critical point of J. Then, by (1.3) and positivity of \u03c7n ,\n0\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\u0001\n\u2207J(u), u = (Lu \u2212 \u03c9u, u) \u2212\n\u03c7n u4n \u2264\n\n=\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2264 (Lu \u2212 \u03c9u, u).\n\nSince \u03b2 = +\u221e, we have that E + = {0} and, by (1.5),\n0 \u2264 \u2212\u03b4kuk2\nwhich implies that u = 0.\n\n2\n\n\u2737\n\nTechnical results\n\nTo prove the existence of kN -periodic solutions, as well as to pass to the limit\nas k \u2192 \u221e, we need some preliminaries. We start with\nLemma 2.1 For any nontrivial critical points u(k) \u2208 Ek of Jk and u \u2208 E of J,\nwith critical values c(k) = Jk (u(k) ) and c = J(u), we have\nu(k)\n\nk\n\n\u2264 4\u03b4 \u22121 \u03ba\u03ba\u22123/4 (c(k) )3/4\n\nand\nkuk \u2264 4\u03b4 \u22121 \u03ba\u03ba\u22123/4 c3/4 ,\nwhere \u03ba = min{\u03c7n } and \u03ba = max{\u03c7n }.\nProof.

Actually, we show that the functional Jk possesses a nontrivial\ncritical point. Moreover, we derive some uniform in k bounds for the critical\npoints and corresponding critical values. The proof relies upon the standard\nlinking theorem (see Appendix B).\nRecall that a sequence v (j) \u2208 Ek is called a Palais-Smale sequence for Jk at\nlevel b if Jk (v (j) ) \u2192 b and Jk\u2032 (v (j) ) \u2192 0 as j \u2192 \u221e.\nLemma 3.1 The functional Jk satisfies the so-called Palais-Smale condition,\ni. e. every Palais-Smale sequence contains a convergent subsequence.\nProof. Since the space Ek is finite dimensional, it is enough to show that\nevery Palais-Smale sequence is bounded. Moreover, replacing L by L + \u03c90 and\n\u03c9 by \u03c9 + \u03c90 , with some \u03c90 , we can assume that L \u226b 1, i. e.\n(Lv, v)k \u2265 kvk2k ,\n\nv \u2208 Ek ,\n\nand \u03c9 > 0.\nLet v\n\n(j)\n\nbe a Palais-Smale sequence at some level b.

Remind that we consider the case\nwhen \u03b2 6= +\u221e and, hence, Ek+ 6= {0}. Fix two constants \u033a > r > 0 and choose\nz k \u2208 Ek+ as follows.\nLet z \u2208 E + be an arbitrary unit vector.

Remind that,\nwithout loss of generality, we consider the case \u03c3 = +1.\n8\n\n\fTheorem 3.1 Suppose that \u03c7n > 0 and \u03c9 \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2), with \u03b2 6= +\u221e. Then for\nevery k \u2265 1 equation (0.4), with \u03c3 = +1, has a nontrivial kN -periodic solution\nu(k) . Moreover, we have the following bounds:\nJk (u(k) ) \u2264 C,\nku(k) kk \u2264 C,\nwhere C > 0 is independent of k.\nProof. The existence follows immediately from the standard linking theorem (see Appendix B). Indeed, to apply that theorem we need two things:\n(a) the Palais-Smale condition and (b) the linking geometry. The Palais-Smale\ncondition is verified in Lemma 3.1, while Lemma 3.2 means exactly that the\nfunctional Jk possesses the linking geometry.\nMoreover, the linking theorem states that the corresponding critical value\nsatisfies\n\u0001\nJk u(k) \u2264 sup Jk (v).\nM\n\nTherefore, the upper bounds for the critical points and critical values follow\nfrom Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 2.1.\n\u2737\n\n4\n\nExistence of localized solutions\n\nThe following result gives the existence of solution u \u2208 l2 in Theorem 0.1.\nTheorem 4.1 Under assumptions of Theorem 3.1 equation (0.4) possesses a\nnontrivial solution u \u2208 l2 .\n(k)\n\nProof. Consider the sequence u(k) = {un } of kN -periodic solutions found\nin Theorem 3.1.\nFirst we claim that there exists \u03b40 > 0 and nk \u2208 Z such that\nu(k)\nnk \u2265 \u03b40 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nIndeed, if not, then u(k) \u2192 0 in l\u221e . Hence, v (k) = Rk u(k) \u2192 0 in l\u221e . By Theorem 3.2, kv (k) kl2 = ku(k) kk is bounded. Now the following simple inequality\n2\nkvkplp \u2264 kvkp\u22122\nl\u221e kvkl2 ,\n\nwhere p > 2, shows that v (k) \u2192 0 in all lp , p > 2. Hence, ku(k) klpk \u2192 0 for\nall p > 2. As in the beginning of proof of Lemma 2.1, we have that for the\ncorresponding critical value ck = Jk (u(k) )\n0 < ck =\n\n\u00034\n\u0002\n1 X\n\u03ba\n\u2264 ku(k) k4l4 \u2192 0.\n\u03c7n u(k)\nn\nk\n4\n4\nn\u2208Qk\n\nHowever, this contradicts Lemma 2.2 and we obtain (4.1).\n9\n\n\f(k)\n\nDue to periodicity of coefficients, {un+N } is also a solution of (0.4). Hence,\nmaking such shifts, we can assume that 0 \u2264 nk \u2264 N \u2212 1 in (4.1). Moreover,\npassing to a subsequence of k's, we can even assume that nk = n0 is independent\nof k.\n(k)\nNext we extract a subsequence, still denoted by u(k) , such that un \u2192 un\nfor every n \u2208 Z. Inequality (4.1) implies that |un0 | \u2265 \u03b40 and, hence, u = {un }\nis a nonzero sequence. It is not difficult to show that equation (0.4) possesses\npoint-wise limits and, therefore, u is a solution of that equation.\nFinally we have that\na\nX\n\nu(k)\nn\n\n2\n\n\u2264 ku(k) kk \u2264 C\n\nn=\u2212a\n\nfor any fixed a \u2208 Z and k large enough. Passing to the limit, we have that\na\nX\n\n|un |2 \u2264 C.\n\nn=\u2212a\n\nSince a is arbitrary, u \u2208 l2 .\n\n\u2737\n\nRemark 4.1 Consider equation (0.4) with small nonlinearity, i. e.\nLun \u2212 \u03c9un = \u03c3\u03bb\u03c7n |un |2 un ,\nwhere \u03bb > 0 is a small parameter (all other data, including \u03c9, are fixed). Then\nLemma 2.1 shows that for the solution u = u\u03bb \u2208 l2 obtained in Theorem 0.1 we\nhave that\nku\u03bb k2 \u2265 c\u03bb\u22121 ,\nwith c > 0. This means that the solution u\u03bb bifurcates from infinity. Actually,\none can scale out \u03bb and obtain the same conclusion directly.\n\n5\n\nExponential decay and nonexistence result\n\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 0.1, we have to show that the solution obtained decays exponentially fast. Actually, we have\nTheorem 5.1 Under assumptions of Theorem 3.1, let u \u2208 l2 be a solution of\nequation (0.4). Then u satisfies\n|un | \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b3|n| ,\n\nn \u2208 Z,\n\nwith some C > 0 and \u03b3 > 0.\nProof. Let vn = \u2212\u03c3\u03c7n |un |2 . Then\ne n \u2212 \u03c9un = 0,\nLu\n10\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fwhere\n\ne n = Lun + vn un .\nLu\n\nSince lim|n|\u2192\u221e vn = 0, the multiplication by vn is a compact operator in l2 .\nHence,\ne = \u03c3ess (L),\n\u03c3ess (L)\n\nwhere \u03c3ess stands for the essential spectrum. Now (5.1) means that u = {un }\nin an eigenfunction that corresponds to the eigenvalue of finite multiplicity \u03c9 \u2208\n/\ne of the operator L.\ne Therefore, the result follows from the standard\n\u03c3ess (L)\ntheorem on exponential decay for such eigenfunctions (see, e. g. [25]).\n\u2737\nThe following result shows that if \u03c9 \u2208 \u03c3(L), then equation (0.4) has no\nwell-decaying (e. g., exponentially fast) nontrivial solution.\nTheorem 5.2 Suppose that \u03c9 \u2208 \u03c3(L) and u is a solution of (0.4) such that\n|n|1/2 un \u2208 l2 . The un \u2261 0.\nProof. We have that u satisfies (5.1) and this means that \u03c9 is an eigenvalue\ne The potential v = {vn } satisfies |n|vn \u2208 l1 and, by Theembedded into \u03c3ess (L).\norem 7.11, [25], \u03c3ess (L) is absolutely continuous, hence, contains no embedded\neigenvalues.\n\u2737\n\n6\n\nAn extension of main result\n\nConsider the following equation\nLun \u2212 \u03c9un = \u03c3fn (un )\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhich is more general that (0.4). Here the operator L is of the same form as\nabove, \u03c9 belongs to some spectral gap (\u03b1, \u03b2) of L and \u03c3 = \u00b11. The nonlinearity\nfn (u) is supposed to satisfy the following assumptions.\n(i) The function fn (u) is continuous in u \u2208 R and depends periodically in n,\nwith period N .\n(ii) There exist p > 2 and c > 0 such that\n0 \u2264 fn (u) \u2264 c|u|p\u22121\nnear u = 0.\n(iii) There exists \u03bc > 2 such that\n0 < \u03bcFn (u) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nu\n\nfn (t) dt \u2264 fn (u)u,\n\nu 6= 0.\n\n0\n\nArguing as in the proof of Theorem 0.1, with corresponding modifications\n(see [17] for a similar result for continuum periodic nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations), we obtain the following result.\n11\n\n\fTheorem 6.1 Under assumptions (i)\u2013(iii) suppose that either \u03c3 = +1 and\n\u03b2 6= +\u221e, or \u03c3 = \u22121 and \u03b1 6= \u2212\u221e. Then equation (6.1) has a nontrivial\nexponentially decaying solution. If either \u03c3 = +1 and \u03b2 = +\u221e, or \u03c3 = \u22121 and\n\u03b1 = \u2212\u221e, then there is no nontrivial solution in l2 .\nThe most important example is the power nonlinearity\nfn (u) = \u03c7n |u|p\u22122 u,\n\n(6.2)\n\nwith p > 2. If p = 4, we obtain the cubic nonlinearity considered in Theorem 0.1\nTheorem 6.1 can be extended immediately to the case of equation (6.1) on\nZd , d \u2265 1, where\nX\na(n, m) um .\nLun =\nm\u2208Zd\n\nHere a(n, m) satisfies\na(n + N, m + N ) = a(n, m)\nfor some N = (N1 , N2 , . . . , Nd ) and\na(n, m) = 0\nwhenever |n \u2212 m| \u2265 a0 > 0. The nonlinearity fn , n \u2208 Zd , must satisfy (i)\u2013(iii)\nand the periodicity assumption\nfn+N (u) = fn (u),\nwith the same N as above.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn the past decade, localized solutions of DNLS has become a topic of intense\nresearch. Much of this work concerns the standard constant coefficient cubic\nDNLS and has been summarized in reviews [7, 11, 13]. Constant coefficient\nDNLS with general power nonlinearity (6.2) (\u03c7n \u2261 1) is considered in [27].\nCertainly, DNLS with periodic coefficients is not less important. In this case\na new phenomenon appears. While the spectrum of \u2212\u2206 consists of a single\nclosed interval, in the spectrum of periodic operator L finite gaps typically open\nup. The corresponding DNLS may have standing wave solutions with carrier\nfrequency in such a gap. Theorems 0.1 and 6.1 give rigorous results of this type.\nNote that in the case of periodic DNLS, and even for more general equations,\nwith \u03c9 below or above the spectrum (depending on \u03c3), such solutions are shown\nto exist in [21]. In that paper the so-called Nehari manifold approach is employed, together with a discrete version of concentration compactness principle.\nFor such values of \u03c9 the quadratic part of the corresponding functional is positive or negative definite. This fact simplifies the situation considerably. When \u03c9\nlies in a finite gap, the quadratic part of the functional is strictly indefinite. This\n12\n\n\fsuggests us to use the linking theorem combined with periodic approximations.\nSuch approach was used before in [16, 17, 20, 18, 19, 24]. Another approach to\nlocalized solutions of periodic DNLS, based on the generalized linking theorem\n(see, e. g. [28]) will be discussed elsewhere.\nNote that two-dimensional discrete gap solitons are observed experimentally\n[8, 9]. In [10] results on numerical simulation of gap solutions in a particular\nperiodic DNLS are reported.1\n\nA\n\nOperator L\n\nLet l denote the vector spaces of all two sided complex valued sequences u =\n{un }n\u2208Z and lp \u2282 l, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the subspace of all p-summable (bounded if\np = \u221e) sequences.

Due to the periodicity assumption,\nG(* + N, * + N ; \u03bb) = G(*, *; \u03bb)\n(A.6)\n(periodicity of the Green function along the diagonal). Moreover, the Green\nfunction possesses an exponential bound of the form\nG(n, m; \u03bb) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03bc|m\u2212n| ,\n\nn, m \u2208 Z,\n\n(A.7)\n\nwhere C > 0 and \u03bc > 0 can be chosen independent of \u03bb as \u03bb ranges over any\ncompact subset of C \\ \u03c3(L) (see, e. g.

Representation (A.5) and inequality\n(A.7) imply that for every \u03bb \u2208 C \\ \u03c3(L) the operator (L \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 is a bounded\nlinear operator in lp for every p \u2208 [1, \u221e]. Moreover, the space Ek is invariant\nwith respect to (L \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 and, for every u \u2208 Ek ,\n(Lk \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 uklpk \u2264 Cp kuklpk ,\nwith Cp > 0 independent of k. In particular, \u03c3(Lk ) \u2282 \u03c3(L).\nLet (\u03b1, \u03b2) be a spectral gap of L. Denote by P + and P \u2212 the spectral\nprojectors in E = l2 that correspond to the parts of \u03c3(L) lying in (\u2212\u221e, \u03b1] and\n[\u03b2, +\u221e), respectively. Note that these are orthogonal projectors. The associated\nspectral subspaces are denoted by E + and E \u2212 , respectively. Also, we note that\n\u03c3(Lk ) \u2229 (\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u2205. We denote by Pk+ and Pk\u2212 the spectral projectors in Ek\nthat correspond to \u03c3(Lk ) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, \u03b1] and \u03c3(Lk ) \u2229 [\u03b2, +\u221e), respectively, and set\nEk\u00b1 = Pk\u00b1 Ek for the spectral subspaces.\nThe projectors P \u00b1 are given by the Riesz formula\nZ\n1\n(L \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 d\u03bb,\nP\u00b1 = \u2212\n2\u03c0i C\u00b1\nwhere C+ (resp., C\u2212 ) is a contour in C \\ \u03c3(L) encircling \u03c3(L) \u2229 [\u03b2, +\u221e) (resp.,\n\u03c3(L) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, \u03b1]) so that \u03c3(L) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, \u03b1] (resp., \u03c3(L) \u2229 [\u03b2, +\u221e)) lies outside.\nTherefore, P \u00b1 is of the form\nX\nP \u00b1 un =\nK(m, n)um ,\n(A.8)\nm\u2208Z\n\n14\n\n\fwhere\n\n1\nK(m, n) = \u2212\n2\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\nG(m, n; \u03bb) d\u03bb.\n\nC\u00b1\n\nHence\nK(m, n) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03bc|m\u2212n| ,\n\nm, n \u2208 Z,\n\n(A.9)\n\nwith some C > 0 and \u03bc > 0. Note that the right hand part of (A.8) is a bounded\nlinear operator in all spaces lp , 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Moreover, the operators Pk\u00b1 are\nexactly the restrictions of P \u00b1 from l\u221e to Ek and, therefore, are given by the\nsame formula (A.8). Also it is easy to verify the operator\nB = (L \u2212 \u03c9)P \u00b1 = P \u00b1 (L \u2212 \u03c9)\nhas a representation of the form\nBun =\n\nX\n\nK(m, n)um ,\n\n(A.10)\n\nm\u2208Z\n\nwith K(m, n) (not the same as in (A.8)) satisfying (A.9).\nLemma A.1 Let B be an operator of the form (A.10) satisfying (A.9).
