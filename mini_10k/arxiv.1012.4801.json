INTRODUCTION\n\nThere is currently significant debate as to the physical\nmechanisms responsible for the continuum of X-ray spectrally \"hard states\" of black hole candidates (BHC) accreting\nin binaries. This debate ranges from the broader issue of\nwhether or not there is a significant contribution to the X-ray\nband from an outflow or jet, to more narrowly focused issues\nwithin given classes of models. For instance, the hard X-ray\nemission has traditionally been attributed to a Comptonizing thermal corona (Eardley, Lightman & Shaipro 1975;\nShapiro, Lightman & Eardley 1976; Sunyaev & Tr\u00fcmper\n1979; Dove et al. 1998, and references therein). These earlier\nworks generally favor a scenario where the corona lies central\nto a truncated outer thin disk. However, if the corona is\ndriven outwards by radiative pressure (e.g., Beloborodov\n1999) could it instead overlay the inner disk? Can the\noptically thick, geometrically thin disk extend inward nearly\nto the innermost stable circular orbit (Miller et al. 2006)?

Does the bulk\nmotion of the flow play a role in Comptonizing the spectrum (Shaposhnikov & Titarchuk 2006; Laurent & Titarchuk\n2007)? Alternatively could the X-rays be comprised of a combination of direct synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) emission from a jet (Markoff, Nowak & Wilms 2005;\nMaitra et al. 2009)? Contributing to the debate, however, is\nthe fact that many of the above cited models, especially when\nconsidering solely Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE )\ndata in the 3\u2013200 keV range (or even narrower energy\nranges), describe the hard state spectra nearly equally well.\nTo study these issues, over the past decade we have been\nusing a series of pointed, approximately bi-weekly, RXTE\nobservations of the BHC Cyg X-1 performed simultaneously with 15 GHz radio observations by the Ryle telescope.\nCyg X-1 holds much promise for exploring the current range\nof questions listed above owing to its persistently bright Xray flux (including both the hard and soft states, it varies between 200\u2013600 mCrab in the 1.2\u201312 keV band covered by\nthe RXTE -All Sky Monitor) and its correlated radio/X-ray\nspectra (see Wilms et al. 2006, and references therein). Extended radio emission even has been imaged in Cyg X-1\n(Stirling et al. 2001). This campaign has already provided the\nspectra for some of the Comptonization models (Wilms et al.\n2006), and jet models (Markoff, Nowak & Wilms 2005) dis-\n\n\f2\n\nNowak et al.\n\ncussed above. Additionally, these data have been used to\nto study the correlation of the X-ray and radio spectral\nproperties on both long time scales (Pottschmidt et al. 2000;\nPottschmidt et al. 2003; Wilms et al. 2006), and short time\nscales (Gleissner et al. 2004, Wilms et al. 2007, B\u00f6ck et al.\n2010, B\u00f6ck et al., in prep.). Thus they comprise a strong\ndata set for addressing not only the details of the X-ray spectrum, but also the connection to the hard state jets which are\nknown to dominate the radio through near-infrared emission.\nSimultaneous radio/X-ray flaring has also been detected in\nCyg X-1 during this extended campaign (Fender et al. 2006,\nWilms et al. 2007), lending support to the hypothesis of X-ray\nemission by the jet.\nRXTE spectral data alone, however, do not allow us to\nbreak the current existing \"theoretical degeneracy\" in the origin of the X-ray spectrum. The statistically best fits are in\nfact obtained with purely empirical simple broken powerlaws\nwith a break occurring between 9\u201312 keV, and an exponential cutoff occurring at >20 keV, to which a broad, \u2248 6.4 keV\ngaussian line is added (Wilms et al. 2006; Nowak et al. 2005).\nThe latter component is likely attributable to a relativistically\nbroadened Fe K\u03b1 line (Reynolds & Nowak 2003, and references therein); however, its parameters are dependent upon\nthe assumed continuum model (Wilms et al. 2006). More\nphysically motivated Comptonization and outflow-dominated\nmodels (Markoff, Nowak & Wilms 2005; Wilms et al. 2006)\ncan describe the same spectra almost as well. However they\nmust introduce additional, albeit plausible, physical components (e.g., relativistic smearing) to recover the simple spectra of the broken powerlaw description. Thus, there is some\namount of ambiguity when correlating detailed spectral features vs. continuum properties, e.g., disk reflection vs. coronal compactness/hardness, as the detailed features systematically depend upon the underlying broad-band continuum.\nDespite these problems in finding a truly unique spectral\nmodel, when considering multiple observations taken over a\nwide range of luminosities and spectral hardnesses, spectral\ncorrelations arise that are robust and persistent across a variety of these theoretical characterizations (Wilms et al. 2006).\nUsing the broken powerlaw models as a simple description\nof the X-ray spectra, we have found that when the 2\u201310 keV\nphoton index \u03931 < 2.2 there is a positive correlation between\nX-ray and radio flux, whereas for \u03931 > 2.2 there is a negative\ncorrelation between the X-ray and radio flux. We therefore\nuse the value of \u03931 \u2248 2.2 as the canonical division between\nthe spectrally \"hard state\" and the spectrally \"soft state\" (see\nRemillard & McClintock 2006). Additionally, as the spectra\nbecome harder, exponential cutoffs tend to become less significant (see also Motta, Belloni & Homan 2009).\nOur previous RXTE spectral studies of Cyg X-1 have been\nlimited in two respects: the low spectral resolution of RXTE\n(E/\u2206E \u2248 6 at 6 keV), and the inability to measure spectra at\n<\n\u223c 3 keV. In this work, we turn to a set of four Suzaku observations that we performed simultaneously with our RXTE\ncampaign to enhance our Cyg X-1 studies in several crucial\nways. First, Suzaku has large effective area at soft X-ray energies. In this work, we consider spectra down to 0.8 keV,\nwhich allows for the possibility of measuring the \"seed photon spectrum\" in Comptonization models (\u00a75.1), or judging\nthe relative contribution of synchrotron versus the disk radiation in jet models (\u00a75.2).

OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nPrior to 2009 April, there have been five Suzaku observations of Cyg X-1. The four most recent of these observations\nare discussed in this work. The first Suzaku Cyg X-1 observation occurred in 2005 October (Makishima et al. 2008).\nDuring this observation Cyg X-1 was in a relatively bright\nhard state (the RXTE -ASM count rate was \u2248 30 cps), the\nspacecraft aimpoint was placed on the Suzaku -X-ray Imag-\n\n\fObservations of the Cygnus X-1 Hard State\ning Spectrometer (XIS) detectors, and Suzaku was run in a\ndata-mode with 1 s integrations per CCD exposure frame. As\ndiscussed by Makishima et al. (2008, see also the Appendix),\nthis long exposure led to both telemetry dropouts and severe\nphoton pileup on the detectors. As these issues require a more\ncomplex analysis (Makishima et al. 2008), we do not consider\nthese data further.\nThe four Suzaku observations discussed here occurred during times when the RXTE -ASM flux ranged from 12\u201323 cps,\nthe spacecraft pointing was set to the Hard X-ray Detector\n(HXD; this slightly reduces the flux on the XIS detectors),\nand the CCD exposure frame integration times were set to\n\u2248 0.5 s. Thus, our observations do not suffer from telemetry\ndropouts and they are less severely affected by photon pileup.\nAll four of these observations occurred simultaneously with\nRXTE observations. The last of these observations also occurred simultaneously with observations by every other Xray/soft gamma-ray instrument flying at that time (Hanke et\nal., in prep.). Here we only consider the simultaneous Chandra -High Energy Transmission Grating. An observing log is\npresented in Table 1.\n2.1. Suzaku Analysis\nThe Suzaku data were reduced with tools from the HEASOFT v6.8 package and calibration files dated 2009 September 25. The instruments on Suzaku (Mitsuda et al. 2007) are\nthe X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS; Koyama et al. 2007)\nCCD detector covering the \u2248 0.3\u201310 keV band, and the Hard\nX-ray Detector (HXD; Takahashi et al. 2007) comprised of\nthe PIN diode detector (PIN) covering the \u2248 10\u201370 keV band\nand the gadolinium silicate crystal detector (GSO) covering\nthe \u2248 60\u2013600 keV band. The XIS has four separate detectors, XIS 0\u20133, with XIS 1 being a backside illuminated CCD.\nXIS 2 was lost due to a micrometeor hit in late 2006, and thus\nwas available only for the first observation (see Table 1). For\nour fourth observation, XIS 0 was run in continuous readout\nmode, which is not yet fully calibrated, so we do not include\nthese data in this work.\nIn preparing the XIS spectra, we first corrected each detector for Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) using the xispi\ntool, and then reprocessed the data with xselect using the\nstandard xisrepro selection criteria. Due to thermal flexing of the spacecraft, the attitude of the Suzaku spacecraft\nexhibits variability over the course of the observations and\ntherefore the image of the source is not at a fixed position on\nthe CCD. Standard processing reduces this variability and improves the PSF image (Uchiyama et al. 2008); however, with\nthe standard tools it is not possible yet to correct fully the\nblurring caused by the varying attitude. As described in the\nAppendix, for bright sources a better reconstruction of the\nattitude solution, and thus narrower PSF images, can be obtained using the aeattcor.sl software. We produced such\nan improved image and then used the pile_estimate.sl\nS-Lang script described in the Appendix to estimate the degree of pileup in the observations. For the spectra described\nin this work, using the time filter criteria described in \u00a73, the\ncenter of the PSF images could be affected by as much as a\n35% pileup fraction. We therefore extracted annular regions\nwherein we excised the \u2248 20\u2032\u2032 radius central region. The excised data accounted for approximately 1/3 of the detected\nevents. The outer radii of our annular extraction regions were\nlimited by the 1/4 sub-array used in our CCD readout mode,\nand thus were \u2248 2\u2032 . We estimate that the extracted events had\n< 4% mean residual pileup fraction. All regions of the CCD\n\n3\n\nare dominated by source counts, therefore we did not extract\nnor use any background spectra for the XIS observations.\nEvents in the XIS detectors were read out from either 3 \u00d7 3\nor 2 \u00d7 2 pixel islands. The XIS 1 data were always in 3 \u00d7 3mode, whereas the other detectors had mixtures of 3 \u00d7 3and 2 \u00d7 2-mode. We created individual spectra and response\nfiles for each detector and data mode combination. Spectra were created for the time intervals described in \u00a73, with\nthe resulting exposure times also being listed in Table 1. Response matrices and effective area files were created with the\nxisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tools, respectively.\nAlthough for each observation the individual XIS spectra\nwere fit separately, they were jointly grouped on a common\ngrid such that they had a minimum combined signal-to-noise\nratio of 8 in each energy bin (i.e., 64 total counts in each bin)\nand that the minimum number of channels per energy bin was\nat least the half width half maximum of the spectral resolution1 . To avoid regions of poorly understood response, we\nonly considered spectral energy ranges 0.8\u20131.72 keV, 1.88\u2013\n2.19 keV, and 2.37\u20137.5 keV2 .\nFor the PIN, we extracted spectra from the \"cleaned\"\nevent files in the hxd/event_cl directories. The appropriate response and background files were downloaded\nfrom the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC), specifically those from the\npinxb_ver2.0_tuned directory. Good time intervals\n(GTI) were merged from our time selections (\u00a73) and the\ncombination of the GTI intervals from the source and background event files. These intersected intervals were then\nused to extract the PIN source and background spectra. The\nsource spectra exposure times were then corrected with the\nhxdtcorr tool. The PIN spectra were grouped to have a\nsignal-to-noise ratio \u2265 10 in each energy bin, and we considered spectra between 12\u201370 keV.\nThe GSO spectra were created starting with the \"unfiltered\" event files. These data were first reprocessed with\nthe hxdtime, hxdpi, and hxdgrade tools, following\nthe \"Suzaku ABC Guide\". The data were then filtered in\nxselect with the standard criteria from the HEASARC provided gso_mkf.sel script. The background was downloaded from the gsonxb_ver2.0 directory at HEASARC.\nGTI from the event file, the background file, and the time intervals were merged, and spectra were extracted from these\ntimes. Response files were then taken from the CALDB\ndatabase, and exposure times were adjusted to agree with the\nspectra. The grouping of the GSO spectra is essentially fixed\nby the grouping of the background file, thus no rebinning was\nperformed on these spectra. It was determined that the background becomes prohibitive above 300 keV; therefore, we restrict the GSO spectra to the 60\u2013300 keV range.\n2.2. RXTE Analysis\n1 The half width half maximum (HWHM) was determined by using the\nspectral responses to create fake spectra of delta function lines at discrete\nenergies. These fake spectra were then fit without response matrices to determine HWHM. In practice, this meant that the original spectra with 4096\nchannels each were grouped, using the ISIS group function, by a minimum\nof 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 channels starting at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and\n7 keV, respectively. For the most part, the spectral binnings were dominated\nby the HWHM criteria rather than the signal-to-noise criterion.\n2 Outside of these energy ranges there are large disagreements among the\nfit residuals for the individual detectors and data modes. The excised regions\nbetween 1.72\u20132.37 keV correspond to poorly calibrated Si and Ir features related to the detectors and mirrors.\n\n\f2.3. Chandra-HETG Analysis\nThe High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG;\nCanizares et al. 2005) was inserted for our observation\nof Cyg X-1, with the data readout mode being Timed\nExposure-Graded. The HETG is comprised of the High\nEnergy Gratings (HEG), with coverage from \u2248 0.7\u20138 keV,\nand the Medium Energy Gratings (MEG), with coverage\nfrom \u2248 0.4\u20138 keV. To minimize pileup in the gratings spectra,\na 1/2 subarray was applied to the CCDs. Additionally, the\nobservatory aimpoint was placed closer to the CCD readout.\nThis configuration reduces the frame time to 1.741 sec,\nwithout any loss of the dispersed spectrum.\nWe used CIAO v4.2 and CALDB v4.2.0 to extract\nthe data and create the spectral response files. The loca-\n\n50\n\nThe RXTE data were prepared with tools from the HEASOFT v6.8 package and the most current calibration files as\nof 2010 January 10. We used standard filtering criteria for\ndata from the Proportional Counter Array (PCA; Jahoda et al.\n1996). Specifically, we excluded data from within 30 minutes\nof South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) passage, from whenever\nthe target elevation above the limb of the earth was less than\n10\u25e6 , and from whenever the electron ratio (a measure of the\ncharged particle background) was greater than 0.15. We used\nthe background models appropriate to bright data.\nWe applied 0.5% systematic errors to all PCA channels,\nadded in quadrature to the errors calculated from the data\ncount rate. For all PCA fits we grouped the data starting at\n\u2265 3 keV with the criteria that the signal-to-noise (after background subtraction, but excluding systematic errors) in each\nbin had to be \u2265 4.5. We restricted the noticed energy range to\n3\u201322 keV.\nWe extracted data from the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE; Rothschild et al. 1998) using the same criteria as for the PCA. HEXTE is comprised of two clusters, A\nand B. Prior to 2007, both clusters were in a rocking mode,\nwith only one detector viewing the source at a given time,\nwhile the other detector conducted off-source background\nmeasurements. For later dates (e.g., our three most recent observations), HEXTE A has been in a fixed on-source position,\nwhich required us to estimate cluster A backgrounds using\nthe hextebackest tool. Furthermore, during our third observation there was clear evidence for a HEXTE A exposure\nanomaly3. We found evidence for such an anomaly (albeit\nless severe) in our second observation as well. We corrected\nthe HEXTE A exposure time by iteratively fitting an exponentially cutoff powerlaw simultaneously to both cluster A and B\ndata and varying the exposure of cluster A until a \u03c72 minimum\nwas achieved using the same normalization for both detectors.\nWe binned the HEXTE spectra to a common grid such that\nthey had a minimum combined signal-to-noise of 8 in each energy channel (even though both clusters were fit individually).\nWe further restricted the noticed energy range to 18\u2013200 keV.\nAdditionally, when fitting the X-ray spectra we allowed the\nnormalization of the HEXTE backgrounds to vary. (The best\nfit normalization constants were typically within <\n\u223c 10% of\nunity.)\nFor both PCA and HEXTE spectra we further restricted the\nconsidered time intervals to those that were strictly simultaneous with the Suzaku spectra. That is, the RXTE time intervals\nform a subset of the Suzaku time intervals.\n\n150\n\nNowak et al.\n\nRate (cps)\n100\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\u00d7104\n\n4\u00d7104\n\n6\u00d7104\n\nTime (sec)\nF IG . 1.- Suzaku -XIS 1 lightcurves (16 sec integration bins) for observation 4 in the 0.5\u20131.5 keV band (filled diamonds, bottom curve) and the 3\u2013\n9 keV band (hollow diamonds, top curve, shifted upward by 50 cps).\n\ntion of the center of the 0th order image was determined using the findzo.sl routine4, which provides \u2248 0.1 pixel\n(\u2248 0.001 \u00c5, for MEG) accuracy. The data were reprocessed\nwith pixel randomization turned off, but pha randomization\nleft on. We applied the standard grade and bad pixel file filters, but we did not destreak the data.\nAlthough the instrumental set up was designed to minimize pileup, it is still present in both the MEG and, to a\nlesser extent, the HEG spectra. We incorporate the effects\nof pileup in our spectral fits using the simple_gpile2\nmodel (Hanke et al. 2009) based upon the model originally\ndescribed by Nowak et al. (2008). For the small amount of\npileup present in these data, this model is extremely successful in describing its effect on the spectra.\nAs for the PCA and HEXTE spectra, we restricted the considered time intervals for the Chandra spectra to those that\nwere strictly simultaneous with the Suzaku spectra.\n2.4. Estimated Radio fluxes\nSimultaneous Ryle radio fluxes are not available for the Xray observations discussed in this work. Owing to the known\nstringent correlations between the X-ray and radio flux,\nspecifically the correlations between the RXTE -ASM and\nRyle fluxes (see Gleissner et al. 2004; Nowak et al. 2005), we\nuse an estimated radio flux when applying the jet model to\nthe spectra (\u00a75.2). From our prior observations we average\nall radio data that occurred at times with ASM daily averages that were within \u00b11\u03c3 of the ASM daily average corresponding to these new observations. The average and standard deviation of these radio data were used in the spectral\nfits, which yielded radio fluxes of 12.6 \u00b1 3.3 mJy (2006-1030), 10.8 \u00b1 3.9 mJy (2007-04-30), 7.9 \u00b1 3.0 mJy (2007-0517), and 10.2 \u00b1 3.0 mJy (2008-04-19). Each average was\ncomprised of a minimum of ten measurements, and the extreme radio flux values within each sample never differed\nfrom the average by more than a factor of two.\n2.5.

The colors are created from the count rate in three bands: 0.5\u20131.5 keV, 1.5\u20133 keV, and\n3\u20139 keV. The lines are the best fit dust halo models, presuming that the source is obscured by both an interstellar neutral column as well as by a neutral column\nlocal to the source, with the latter ranging in value from 0\u20132 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 . Filled symbols indicate the periods used for the spectral analyses described in this\nwork. (See text.)\n\nThroughout this work we will present spectra that are \"unfolded\" from the detector response in a model-independent\nmanner (see Nowak et al. 2005). Specifically, we define the\nunfolded photon flux, Funfold (h), from a pulse height (PHA)\nbin, h, as\nFunfold (h) = R\n\nC(h) \u2212 B(h)\n,\nR(h, E) A(E) dE \u2206t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C(h) \u2212 B(h) are the background subtracted counts,\nR(h, E) and A(E) are the detector response matrix and effective area, and \u2206t is the exposure time. For multiple data\nsets coadded together for the plots (e.g., the Suzaku -XIS or\nthe RXTE -HEXTE data), the numerator and denominator are\neach replaced with the sum of the same quantities from the\ndetectors. Throughout we only sum data for the plots, not for\nthe fits.\nModel spectra are \"unfolded\" in a similar manner. That is,\npredicted background subtracted model counts are first calculated, and then unfolded as above. Thus, the model spectra\n\nexhibit the smearing induced by the detector response matrix.\nThe one exception to this model component scheme is for the\njet results presented in \u00a75.2. There some of the model components are shown unsmeared by the detector response, as they\nare derived from internal calculations of the jet code.\n3. LIGHTCURVES\n\nBy design, our fourth observation occurred near binary orbital phase 0 (superior conjunction of the black hole), wherein\nwe expected to be viewing Cygnus X-1 through the wind of\nthe secondary. By happenstance, all of our remaining Suzaku\nobservations also occurred near superior conjunction, i.e., observations 1\u20134 cover orbital phases 0.2\u20130.3, 0.8\u20130.0, 0.85\u2013\n0.0, and 0.0\u20130.14, respectively. Although dipping events are\nknown to be present during all orbital phases, during upper\nconjunction dipping is prevalent due to absorption by clumps\nin the wind (Ba\u0142uci\u0144ska-Church et al. 2000). This behavior\nis clearly seen in the Suzaku lightcurves presented in Fig. 1.\nThe soft X-ray lightcurve shows a deep, prolonged \u2248 12 ksec\n\n\f6\n\nNowak et al.\n\ndip. A less pronounced, but still significant dip is seen in the\nhard X-ray lightcurve (Hanke et al. 2008). Numerous dips of\nvarying levels are also seen on even shorter time scales. In\norder to extract the unabsorbed spectrum of the source, it is\ntherefore necessary to screen the data for dipping and excise\nthe dipping intervals from further analysis.\nIn addition to dipping, spectral modeling also has to\ntake into account the strong dust scattering halo in front\nof Cyg X-1 (Predehl & Schmitt 1995). As discussed by\nXu, McCray & Kelley (1986, and references therein), a scattering halo is produced by the scattering of radiation from an\nX-ray source by a foreground dust cloud. Typical halo sizes\nare on the order of arcminutes, i.e., comparable to the size\nof the Suzaku PSF. The energy dependence of the scattering\ncross section leads to a halo angular size that is \u221d E \u22121 and\na halo spectrum that is \u221d E \u22122 . Furthermore, as the scattered\nphotons travel along a greater path length to reach the observer, they are delayed with respect to the directly observed\nphotons by a factor that is proportional to the square of the\nangular radius from which the scattered photons are observed.\nThe expected time delays for nearby galactic sources typically\nrange from thousands to tens of thousands of seconds.\nThus the Suzaku spectrum and lightcurve of Cyg X-1 are\ncomprised of two components: a directly observed component, subject to the local dipping events, and a time-delayed\nand time-averaged (due to integration over different angular\nradii) softer spectrum from the scattering halo. Most spectral analyses in the past have ignored the effects of scattering\nsince to first order for optically thin scattering in a homogeneous cloud, whatever radiation that is scattered out of the\nline of sight is scattered back in from larger (often spatially\nunresolved) radii. Thus, for spatially unresolved (on the size\nscale of the halo) and steady sources, dust can be ignored in\nsimple analyses.\nIf one assumes that the time-delayed and time-averaged\nspectrum is represented by the same model as the direct spectrum, and if one further assumes that interstellar absorption\nis predominantly in the foreground of the dust halo, within\nISIS one can write the spectral model for the spectra during\nthe dips as:\nTBnew(1) \u2217 (1 \u2212 dustscat \u2217 (1 \u2212 TBnew(2)))\u2217\n(continuum model) .\n\n(2)\n5\n\nHere and throughout we shall use an updated version of\nthe absorption model of Wilms, Allen & McCray (2000) to\ndescribe both the interstellar (model instance 1) and local\n(model instance 2) absorption. The dustscat model is a\nversion of the XSPEC dust model that removes the optically thin assumption of the latter model, but otherwise ignores multiple scatterings (F. Baganoff, priv. comm.). Note\nthat when local absorption is absent (TBnew(2) \u2192 1), the\ndust scattering term drops out of the model expression.\nNot all of the assumptions encompassed within the above\nmodel expression are necessarily realistic. Specifically, the\nassumptions that all interstellar absorption is foreground to\nthe dust and that the delayed source spectrum is identical to\ndirect spectrum are undoubtedly wrong in fine detail. However, we find that the above expression provides a reasonable\ndescription of the color-color diagrams in Fig. 2. Specifically,\nwe create a spectrum from bright phases of the lightcurve that\n5\n\nhttp://pulsar.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/wilms/\nresearch/tbabs\n\nTABLE 2\nO BSERVATIONAL F LUXES IN KE V E NERGY BANDS\nDate\n(yyyy-mm-dd)\n\n0.5\u20132\n\n2006-10-30\n2007-04-30\n2007-05-17\n2008-04-19\n\n0.16\n0.07\n0.07\n0.14\n\n2\u201310 10\u2013100 100-300\n(10\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 )\n0.78\n0.55\n0.38\n0.72\n\n2.76\n2.07\n1.33\n2.62\n\n1.59\n1.32\n0.87\n1.44\n\nLBol a\n(LEdd )\n0.032\n0.026\n0.017\n0.035\n\nN OTE. - Fluxes are absorbed values, are normalized to the\nPCA spectral fit, and correspond to the brightest/least absorbed\nperiods of the lightcurves.\na Unabsorbed, isotropic luminosity in 0.01-800 keV band, expressed as a fraction of Eddington luminosity, as determined from\nthe thermal Comptonization fits of \u00a75.1 and assuming a distance\nof 2.3 kpc and a black hole mass of 10 M\u2299 .\n\ninhabit a locus of points in the upper right hand corner of the\ncolor-color diagrams (i.e., the filled symbols of Fig. 2).

Our best fits yield \u03c4 = 0.24\u20130.34,\nand the results are shown in Fig. 2.\nOverall, these curves describe the behavior of the colorcolor diagrams reasonably well. The dust halo represents\n\u2248 20%\u201330% (i.e., on the order of the scattering optical depth)\nof the soft X-ray (<\n\u223c 2 keV) flux being \"uncovered\" during\nthe dips. Given the much narrower Chandra PSF, one would\nexpect comparable Chandra color-color diagrams to show a\nfar smaller uncovered fraction if the dust halo interpretation\nis correct. This is indeed found to be true, with Chandra\nshowing only an \u2248 2% uncovered fraction (Hanke et al. 2008,\nHanke et al., in prep.). However, it is possible that the very\nlow uncovered fraction required by the Chandra data might,\nin fact, be partly intrinsic to the local dipping at the source\n(Hanke et al. in prep.). Note that the theoretical curves show\na greater degree of curvature than the observed, nearly linear,\nevolution toward the lower left hand corner of the diagram.\nWe hypothesize that this discrepancy is due to our assumption\nin eq. (2) of purely neutral absorption in the dips. A concurrent increase in the optical depth of ionized absorption could\nserve to alter the theoretical curves in the appropriate manner.\nWe return to this concept of an ionized absorber component\nin \u00a74.2.\n4. SIMPLE SPECTRAL MODELS\n\nThe lightcurves and color-color diagrams described above\nwere used to create spectra for the time periods corresponding\nto the bright phases of the lightcurve represented in the upper\nright corner of the color-color diagrams (Fig. 2). The selections that we made are highlighted as filled symbols within\nthese figures. The resulting exposure times are given in Table 1. With the exception of the RXTE -only broken powerlaw\nspectral fits described immediately below, throughout the rest\nof this work we shall only describe spectra from these bright\nphase, minimally locally absorbed time periods.\n4.1.

The photon indices of the broken powerlaw, which we label as \u03931 and \u03932 for the soft (\u2248 3\u2013\n10 keV) and hard (>\n\u223c 10 keV) X-rays, show a correlation\nin the sense that the amplitude of the break between the\ntwo, \u03931 \u2212 \u03932 , increases with higher (i.e., softer) values of\n\u03931 . This \u0393\u2013\u2206\u0393 correlation is a very phenomenological\ndescription of the spectral correlation that elsewhere has\nbeen described as a \"\u0393\u2013\u03a9/2\u03c0\" (hardness/reflection fraction)\ncorrelation (Zdziarski, Lubi\u0144ski & Smith 1999). Following\nRemillard & McClintock (2006), Wilms et al. (2006) classified spectra with \u03931 <\n\u223c 2.2 as \"hard state\" spectra.\nIn order to compare the spectra discussed here to the work\nof Wilms et al. (2006), we take the 9 RXTE spectra6 and fit\nthem with exponentially cutoff broken powerlaws. As in the\nwork of Wilms et al. (2006), these simple phenomenological\nmodels are excellent descriptions of these data. This is even\ntrue for the spectra extracted from times of moderate and\ndeep dips. These latter spectra have slightly reduced values\nof \u03931 and increased values of the fitted neutral column, NH\n(Wilms et al. 2006 show that orbital phase-dependence of the\ncolumn is discernible in our RXTE observations of Cyg X-1),\nbut otherwise appear similar to non-dip phase spectra. This is\nnot entirely surprising given that RXTE is primarily sensitive\nat energies >\n\u223c 3 keV, and therefore does not measure the spectral regime most strongly affected by the dips.\nWe show the resulting photon indices of these spectra\nalong side the results from Wilms et al. (2006) in Fig. 3.\nOur prior study covered seven years and 202 RXTE spectra. These newer observations overlap the historically hardest\nstates measured in that campaign. Specifically, for these new\nobservations \u03931 ranged from 1.63\u20131.71, which is to be compared to the \u03931 = 1.65 minimum found in Wilms et al. (2006).\nIn some cases, these observations also correspond to historically faint hard states of Cyg X-1. Defining the \"hard state\" as\n\u03931 \u2264 2.2, the lowest 2\u2013100 keV flux in the hard state reported\nby Wilms et al. (2006) was 2.46 \u00d7 10\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , while the\nhighest 2\u2013100 keV hard state flux reported in that work was\n4.50 \u00d7 10\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . As shown in Table 2, the 2\u2013100 keV\nfluxes spanned by the bright phase, least absorbed observations range from 1.71\u20133.54\u00d710\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nThat these spectra are among the faintest and hardest\never observed for Cyg X-1 is important to note.

(2006). Triangles represent the hard states\n(\u03931 < 2.2), and circles represent soft states (\u03932 \u2265 2.2). The solid diamonds\nrepresent exponentially cutoff, broken powerlaw fits to the RXTE data discussed in this work. There are spectra from four observations that have been\nfurther subdivided into up into times covering different portions of the colorcolor diagrams of Fig. 2, for a total of 9 RXTE spectra.\n\nare expected to have the smallest observed reflection fraction and the disk inner radius should be at a maximum\n(Zdziarski, Lubi\u0144ski & Smith 1999). However, it is also important to note that other black hole systems can show substantially fainter spectra relative to Eddington luminosity.\nFurthermore, as we see here and as has been noted elsewhere,\nthe range of hard state fluxes observed in Cyg X-1 spans only\na factor of two, and it is unlikely that the bolometric flux spans\na much greater factor than this even when including observations from the soft state (Wilms et al. 2006).\nAs a further comparison to the previously observed\nhard states, we consider the value of the fitted folding\nenergy. For the hard states discussed by Wilms et al.\n(2006), the folding energy ranges from \u2248 125\u2013255 keV.\nOther BHC, e.g., GX 339\u22124, have shown a wider range of\nhard state folding energies, i.e., \u2248 50\u2013300 keV (Wilms et al.\n1999; Nowak, Wilms & Dove 2002; Nowak et al. 2005;\nMotta, Belloni & Homan 2009). In our prior studies we did\nnot consider spectra above 125 keV. Here, however, with the\ninclusion of the Suzaku -GSO spectra we can now consider\nenergy ranges up to 300 keV. For all four of our observations,\nan exponential rollover is clearly detected. An example is\n\n\fNowak et al.\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nEnergy (keV)\nF IG . 4.- Suzaku -HXDPIN (brown squares) and GSO (magenta triangles)\nspectra, and RXTE -HEXTE (green diamonds) spectra from the least absorbed periods of observation 4 fit with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw.\n\ngiven in Fig. 4, which also gives a general indication of the\nconsistency of the cross-correlation among the hard X-ray detectors. The values of the folding energies, along with crossnormalization constants, are given in Table 3. The folding\nenergies range from 164\u2013252 keV, nearly the full span encompassed by our prior hard state observations. This is not necessarily surprising. Whereas Wilms et al. (2006) had observed a\ngeneral trend for the cutoff to increase to higher energies with\nharder spectra, there was a large degree of scatter about this\ntrend, consistent with these four observations.\n4.2. Ionized Absorption Models\nPrevious Chandra -HETG observations of Cyg X-1 have revealed evidence of the ionized, focused wind from the donor\nstar (Miller et al. 2005; Hanke et al. 2009). The effects of this\nwind upon the spectrum must be accounted for in any detailed analysis of Cyg X-1. While ionized line absorption is\nvery pronounced during the deepest part of the absorption dips\n(Fig. 1), we stress that such absorption is also significant during the bright phase (non-dip) spectra discussed in this work.\nWe begin by considering the joint 0.8-7.5 keV Suzaku\nand Chandra -HETG spectra from the 2008 April 19 observations. As the MEG spectra are more heavily affected by photon pile-up, we fitted only the HEG spectra. We used the same absorbed disk plus powerlaw\n(TBnew*(diskbb+powerlaw)) continuum model to fit\nboth the Suzaku and HETG spectra. We also added to\nboth spectral models a broad Fe K\u03b1 line (modeled with\ndiskline; Fabian et al. 1989) and a narrow Fe K\u03b1 line\nmodeled with a gaussian, and a 6.7 keV (Fe XXV) absorption\nline. Following Hanke et al. (2009), we describe the line absorption as a series of gaussian absorption lines representing\na variety of ionized species - predominantly H- and He-like\nlines from elements ranging from O to Fe, and L-shell transitions of Fe. This initial line list contained nearly 100 line transitions parameterized by wavelength (which we constrained to\nfall within 1500 km s\u22121 of their rest wavelengths), full width\nhalf maximum (constrained to be between 5\u201340 mA), and line\nequivalent width. Based upon fits to the joint Suzaku -HETG\nspectra, this initial list was reduced to the 55 significant lines\npresent in the spectra.\n\n\u03c7\n\u221220\u221210 0\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n5\u00d710\u221210 10\u22129 2\u00d710\u22129\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22128\n\n5\u00d710\u22129\n\n8\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\nEnergy (keV)\nF IG . 5.- Suzaku (blue diamonds) and Chandra -HETG (grey histogram;\n\u00b11st order HEG only) data from observation 4. The model consists of absorbed disk and powerlaw components, broad and narrow gaussian lines in\nthe Fe K\u03b1 region, and absorption lines from a variety of highly ionized\nspecies, including from Fe XXV at \u2248 6.7 keV. Additionally, we modify the\nHETG spectra by dust scattering and a pileup term (see text). The Suzaku\nand HETG spectra have not been renormalized with respect to one another.\nThe residuals shown here are for this joint model fit with all broad and narrow\nline normalizations (both emission and absorption) set to zero.\n\nThe above joint model received two modifications for\nsolely the HETG spectra. The simple_gpile2 model (see\nHanke et al. 2009) was applied to describe the effects of pile\nup in the gratings spectra. Owing to this spectrum being\nfainter and harder than the Cyg X-1 spectrum described in\nHanke et al. (2009), these spectra required an even smaller\npileup correction. Additionally, we applied the dust scattering\nmodel (dustscat) to the HETG spectrum. As described in\n\u00a73, dust scattering represents a loss term for the high spatial\nresolution Chandra spectra. This component, albeit with a\ntime delay of thousands to tens of thousands seconds, scatters\nback into the Suzaku spectrum from arcsecond to arcminute\nangular scales. To the extent that one can ignore the time evolution of the spectrum, the dust scattering term can be ignored\nin the Suzaku spectra. Lacking any detailed information of\nthe average spectrum prior to the start of our observations,\nwe do not apply any dust scattering correction to the Suzaku\nspectra.\nTo be explicit, we apply to the Suzaku data a model of the\nform:\nTBnew \u2217 lines\u2217\n(diskbb + powerlaw + diskline + gaussian)\n\n(3)\n\nwhile we apply to the HETG data a model of the form:\nsimple_gpile2 \u2297 (TBnew \u2217 lines \u2217 dustscat\u2217\n(diskbb + powerlaw + diskline + gaussian)) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere lines represents the ionized line absorption.\nThroughout the rest of this work, we shall ignore as we are\ndoing here the effects of dust scattering on the RXTE and\nSuzaku data. Again, this implicitly assumes that the bright\nphase spectrum has been steady over the time span of thousands to tens of thousands of seconds. This assumption is\nunlikely to be valid in detail; however, we lack the data to\nemploy any more sophisticated assumptions.\n\n\f9\n\n\u03c72\n\u221220\u221210 0 10\n\nRatio\n1 1.051.1\n\n3\u00d710\u22129\n\n\u03bbF\u03bb (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n5\u00d710\u221210\n10\u22129\n2\u00d710\u22129\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n3.5\u00d710\u22129\n\n5\u00d710\u22129\n\nObservations of the Cygnus X-1 Hard State\n\n5\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\nF IG . 6.- The HEG data from a joint fit of the Suzaku and Chandra data\nwith a simple continuum model (disk, powerlaw, broad and narrow Fe region lines, neutral ISM absorption) plus two ionized absorber components\ndescribed with the warmabs model. The residuals include all of these models components; the remaining line residuals are features not described by the\nwarmabs components.\n\nThis simple model describes the spectra well with a dust\nhalo optical depth of 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 (90% confidence level), i.e.,\nconsistent with the fits to the color-color diagrams presented\nin \u00a73. This spectral fit is shown in Fig. 5. The important\npoint to note here is that the ionized absorption is extremely\nstatistically significant in the Suzaku spectra, even though the\nindividual lines are not resolved. Inclusion of these lines is vital for obtaining a description of the soft end of the spectrum,\nand thus we include ionized absorption in all of our model fits.\nBeing that we do not have HETG spectra simultaneous with\nour other three Suzaku spectra, we use the ionized absorption\nfit presented in Fig. 5. Specifically, for all subsequent spectral fits described in this work, we freeze the line positions,\nwidths, and relative equivalent widths to the values found for\nthis joint fit. The line equivalent widths are tied together via\na single normalization constant, and this normalization constant becomes the sole fit parameter describing the ionized\nabsorption. The model, however, still consists of 55 individual absorption lines. As described below, this approach works\nwell in all of our spectral fits.\nWe explored whether a more sophisticated ionization model\ncould be applied to our data. Rather than fit individual lines\nto the joint Suzaku and Chandra data, we instead used the\nwarmabs model (Kallman & Bautista 2001) to describe the\nionized absorption. A model that includes two ionized components - one with a column of (7 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 and ionization parameter log10 \u03be = 2.77 \u00b1 0.05 and one with a column of (3 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 and ionization parameter log10 \u03be =\n1.93 \u00b1 0.07 (90% confidence levels), and both with densities of 1010 cm\u22123 - describes the data reasonably well. As\nshown in Fig. 6, however, a number of prominent line features are not well-fit in the Chandra data. Furthermore, aside\nfrom being an extremely computationally expensive model to\nrun, when fit to the Suzaku data alone the warmabs models would tend to gravitate toward low ionization parameter\nvalues that, although capable of mimicking some of the continuum features of the Suzaku data, did not include the high\nionization line features that were clearly present in the Chan-\n\n6\n\n7\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nF IG . 7.- The summed unfolded Suzaku spectra from unabsorbed periods\nfrom observations 2\u20134, shown in the Fe K\u03b1 line region. These data have been\nfit with a model consisting of an absorbed powerlaw, narrow Fe K\u03b1 emission line, narrow Fe XXV absorption line, and a relativistically broadened\ndiskline model. (See text for fitting procedures.) The individual model\ncomponents (powerlaw, with added diskline, and separately with added narrow emission and absorption lines) are shown overlain on the spectra, while\nthe residuals are shown with and without the emission and absorption line\ncomponents.\n\ndra data. For these reasons, we choose the empirical approach\noutlined above.\nSeveral things need to be borne in mind when considering\nour results: whereas we allow for an overall normalization\nchange in our ionized absorber model, we do not allow for\nchanges of the ionization state. As Fig. 5 shows, with the\nexception of a weak Fe XXV line, there are essentially no\nionized lines with energies >\n\u223c 3 keV. Thus it is unlikely that\nthis simple empirical approach will directly impact, for example, broad Fe line studies. However, in as much as ionization\nchanges could affect our soft X-ray continuum fits, and these\ncontinuum fits in turn affect our estimate of the breadth and\nstrength of the red wing of any broad line tail (see \u00a75.3), potential ionization changes in this absorber must be considered\nan additional source of systematic uncertainty in the results\ndiscussed below.\n4.3. Composite Relativistic Line\n\nThe fit described above consisted of both broad and narrow\nfeatures in the Fe K\u03b1 region. Here we examine this spectral region in a somewhat phenomenological manner to gauge\nthe interplay between these narrow and broad features. We\nwish to consider the average line profile from roughly similar Cyg X-1 spectra. The three most recent Suzaku observations occurred closest to orbital phase 0 and show very similar\ncolor-color diagrams. As discussed below, these three spectra\nare fit with comparable ionized absorption normalization constants. We therefore consider these spectra jointly and ignore\nthe first Suzaku observation. We fit these spectra with a model\nconsisting of a powerlaw, narrow emission near 6.4 keV and\nnarrow absorption near 6.7 keV, plus a relativistically broadened Fe line (again using the diskline model). The relativistically broadened line is characterized by a broad tail extending redward from the line rest frame energy, and a sharper\npeak (due to Doppler boosting) blueward of the line rest frame\nenergy.\nFor purposes of this discussion, we allow the powerlaw to\n\n\fNowak et al.\n\n1\n\nRatio\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nEnergy (keV)\nF IG . 8.- Suzaku (blue line), Chandra -HEG (grey line), and RXTE -PCA\n(purple diamonds) residuals from fitting an absorbed powerlaw to the 3.5\u2013\n4.5 keV and 7\u20137.5 keV regions simultaneously. The Chandra -HEG data have\nbeen binned to match approximately the binning of the Suzaku data.\n\nassume independent parameter values for each of the Suzaku\nobservations. The energies and widths of the narrow lines are\ntied together for all three observations, but the line strengths\nare fitted individually. The broad line has an energy fixed\nto 6.4 keV and an emissivity index fixed to \u03b2 = \u22123 (i.e., line\nemissivity is \u221d R\u22123 , where R is the emission radius within\nthe disk), and the disk inclination is fixed at 35\u25e6 (the value\nadopted by Herrero et al. 1995, from the middle of the range\nof suggested inclinations). The inner radius of the broad line\nemission is tied together for all three observations, but the line\nstrengths are left independent. The \u03c72 of the fit is determined\nfrom the sum of \u03c72 values from the individual observations;\nhowever, in Fig. 7 we show the spectra, fitted models, and\nresiduals from the combined data. We fit the spectra only in\nthe 4.5\u20137.5 keV bandpass.\nThese joint fits strongly require the presence of a broad\nline. The broad line is significantly detected in each individual XIS detector from each individual observation. Under the\nassumptions of the continuum model applied here, the broad\nline equivalent width is approximately three times that of the\nnarrow line equivalent width. The best fit inner radius for\n+2.9\nthe broad line emission is 10.6\u22121.9\nGM/c2 (90% confidence\nlevel), i.e., close to the innermost stable circular orbit for a\nSchwarzschild black hole. As we will discuss further in \u00a75.1,\nthe specific value for such an inner radius is dependent upon\nthe fitted continuum. Nevertheless, a broad excess is required\nredward of the Fe K\u03b1 line.\nIn describing the residuals in this region with a broad line,\nwe see that the Fe XXV absorption line occurs near the blue\nwing peak of the relativistically broadened line (Fig. 7). Both\nthe narrow emission and absorption lines in the Fe region are\nrequired in the HETG spectra when considered by themselves\n(see also Hanke et al. 2009), and thus they cannot be ignored\nin the Suzaku spectra. The HETG spectra, however, are not\nparticularly well-suited for describing any broad component\nof the Fe line. (See Fig. 8 and the discussion of Hanke et al.\n2009 concerning broad line fits to our prior joint RXTE Chandra -HETG observations of Cyg X-1.)\nOn the other hand, if we compare the RXTE spectra to both\nthe Suzaku and HETG spectra, we find that the RXTE spec-\n\nF IG . 9.- Possible X-ray emission geometry of the Cyg X-1 system. Part\nof the soft X-rays likely come from an accretion disk, which may be truncated at its inner edge by a hot corona. Two possible (of many suggested)\ngeometries are shown for this corona: a torus, and a quasi-spherical cloud. In\nsome models, the disk can reform in the inner regions of the accretion flow\n(Mayer & Pringle 2007). The corona will Compton upscatter a fraction of the\ndisk component(s) soft X-rays to hard X-rays. Whether or not the corona envelopes the disk(s) determines whether or not an additional, unComptonized\ndisk component should be present in the spectra. (If the disk reforms on the\ninner edge of a toroidal corona, for example, a fraction of its soft X-rays\nwill not intersect the corona.) Hard X-rays will be reprocessed into reflection/fluorescent line components, predominantly by the outer disk. Finally,\nthe jet might contribute to the observed X-ray emission via synchrotron and\nsynchrotron self-Compton emission.\n\ntra alone require an Fe line equivalent width that cannot be\naccommodated with solely the narrow line component from\nthe Suzaku -HETG fit. We highlight this fact in Fig. 8, where\nwe show the residuals from a powerlaw fit in the 3.5\u20134.5 keV\nand 7\u20137.5 keV region to the joint RXTE -Suzaku -HETG spectra. In this figure, we have binned the HETG spectra to match\napproximately the binning of the Suzaku spectra. There is\noverall good agreement between the RXTE and Suzaku residuals; both require a broad red wing in the Fe line region. The\nnarrow Fe K\u03b1 emission and Fe XXV absorption are clearly\nseen in the HETG spectra; however, when viewed by itself,\nany broad Fe line component in the HETG spectra could be\nsubsumed via a slight powerlaw slope change. We ascribe\nthis latter fact to remaining calibration issues in the HETG\ndetector. Based upon these results, we include broad and narrow Fe K\u03b1 emission and narrow Fe XXV absorption in all the\nsubsequent fits presented in this work. As we shall discuss\nbelow, however, the implied broad line parameters are dependent upon the assumed continuum model.\n5. BROAD BAND MODELS\n\nWe now turn to a discussion of the 0.8\u2013300 keV, joint\nSuzaku -RXTE spectra for the bright phases of our four\nCyg X-1 observations. Here we consider three different\nComptonization models, two of which are discussed in detail,\nand a jet model. (\"Toy geometries\" for some of these situations are presented in Fig. 9.) The latter model also contains\nComptonization components that represent both Comptonization of disk photons as well as synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC). The non-jet models discussed below all rely upon the\neqpair model (Coppi 1999, 2005) to describe the fitted\nComptonization components.\n5.1.

Suzaku -XIS\nspectra from individual detectors/data modes and RXTE -HEXTE spectra from each cluster were summed for the figures, but not for the fits. Here, and throughout\nthe remainder of this paper, XIS data are filled blue diamonds, PCA data are hollow purple circles, PIN data are hollow green diamonds, HEXTE data are brown\nsquares, and GSO data are hollow magenta triangles. The following model components are shown: the summed model with the reflection component excluded,\nthe reflection component by itself, the broad and narrow Fe K\u03b1 line components, the seed photons without Comptonization applied, the additional disk component\nwith peak temperature tied to the seed photons, and the additional low temperature disk component. Neutral and ionized absorption are applied to all shown\nmodel components.\n\nenergy distributions. The latter distribution is governed by a\nparameterized powerlaw, which for purposes of the fits described here we left at the default eqpair values. Specifically, the electron phase space density follows a distribution\n\u221d E \u22122 , where E is the electron energy, between energies of\n1.3 eV\u20131 MeV. The eqpair model rather than being parameterized by a coronal electron scattering optical depth and temperature is instead parameterized by a seed electron optical\ndepth (pair production within the corona, accounted for in the\ncode, can yield higher net scattering optical depths) and coronal compactness parameters, l (proportional to component luminosity or power divided by radius). The latter parameters\nare divided into two relative compactness parameters: lh /ls ,\nthe coronal compactness divided by the seed photon compactness, and lnt /lh , the compactness of the non-thermal electron\npopulation divided by the total electron population compactness. Over a wide range of parameters, the hardness of the\n\nspectrum and the temperature of the corona increases with increasing compactness (although pair production can modify\nthat effect).\nThe seed photon spectrum can be set to either a blackbody or a disk spectrum (essentially the diskpn model\nfrom XSPEC; Gierli\u0144ski et al. 1999). We choose the latter\nseed photon spectrum, with the peak temperature of this disk\n(kTdisk1 ) becoming a fit parameter. We also allow for an unscattered disk component by including an additional diskbb\ncomponent with peak temperature fixed to the peak temperature of the seed photons. Our choice for the normalization\nof this component depends upon the specific Comptonization\nmodel under consideration (see below).\nTo account for soft excesses (i.e., below \u2248 1.5 keV) in the\nspectra, we sometimes include an additional unscattered disk\ncomponent with freely varying normalization and temperature\n(Adisk2 , kTdisk2 ). We searched for, and easily found, solutions\nwhere the peak temperature of this unscattered disk com-\n\n\fNowak et al.\n\nObs. 2\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nObs. 1\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\n12\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nObs. 4\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nObs. 3\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nF IG . 11.- Same as Fig. 10, but for the non-thermal corona, low kTseed eqpair model fits. The following model components are shown: the summed\nmodel with the reflection component excluded, the reflection component by itself, the broad and narrow Fe K\u03b1 line components, the seed photons without\nComptonization applied, and the additional disk component with peak temperature tied to the seed photon peak temperature. Neutral and ionized absorption are\napplied to all shown model components.\n\nponent was below \u2248 300 eV. The eqpair model includes\nreflection from an ionized disk (i.e., a modification of the\npexriv model; Done et al. 1992) which is smeared by relativistic distortions with the emissivity profile of a ShakuraSunyaev type disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). A fittable parameter is the inner radius of this disk smearing profile (see\nbelow). We also fix the disk (i.e., reflector) temperature to\n106 K, the reflector inclination to 35\u25e6 , and allow the reflection\nfraction (\u03a9/2\u03c0) and reflector ionization parameter (\u03be) to be fit\nparameters. The latter is limited to values \u2264 1000.\nLine absorption is described by the parameterized (i.e., single normalization constant) model discussed in \u00a74.2. A narrow gaussian is added at 6.399 keV with its width frozen\nto 0.01 keV, but with a freely variable normalization. A\ndiskline component (essentially the profile for a disk\naround a Schwarzschild black hole; Fabian et al. 1989) is\nadded to describe the broad line. Its energy is fixed to 6.4 keV,\nthe disk line emissivity index is set to \u03b2 = \u22123, and the disk inclination is set to 35\u25e6 . Typically one allows the inner emission\nradius to be variable (see \u00a74.3). Here we tie this inner radius\n\nto that of the reflector in the eqpair model. The line normalization, however, is allowed to freely vary.\nA number of authors have considered \"sphere+disk\" Comptonization models wherein an inner quasi-spherical corona\nis encircled by a cool, geometrically thin disk that typically\nhas a peak temperature of \u2248 200 eV (Gierli\u0144ski et al. 1997;\nDove et al. 1997). We were unable to find any solutions for\ncoronae with thermal electron distributions (i.e., lnt /lh frozen\nat 10\u22123 ) that allowed for such a low seed photon temperature. The only such thermal corona solutions that we found\nrequired seed photon temperatures of 0.8\u20131 keV. Fit parameters for these solutions are presented in Table 4, and spectral\nfits are shown in Fig. 10.\nConcepts for the potential geometry represented by this\nspectral fit are shown in Fig. 9. The high temperature seed\nphotons could be a recondensed inner disk as envisioned by\nMayer & Pringle (2007), while the low temperature soft excess, the broad line, and the reflection component could emanate from an outer disk. (The narrow line likely arises from\nfluorescence from the secondary and/or spatially extended gas\n\n\fRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nObservations of the Cygnus X-1 Hard State\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\nF IG . 12.- Same as Fig. 10, but only showing observation 4 for the multiple eqpair component fit (see text). The following model components\nare shown: the two individual eqpair components with their reflection components excluded, the reflection component of the dominant eqpair spectrum, the broad and narrow Fe K\u03b1 line components, and the unscattered disk\ncomponent.\n\nsurrounding the system; Torrej\u00f3n et al. 2010.) A more physically self-consistent model would allow for an additional seed\nphoton contribution from this outer disk, and possibly a broad\nline component from the inner, hot seed photon emission region. However, it is interesting to note that these solutions required very little additional unscattered, high temperature disk\ncomponent. (Table 4 contains low\u2013 sometimes zero\u2013 values of\nAdisk1 . Both the initial seed photon distribution and the associated high temperature, unscattered disk spectrum are shown in\nFig. 10; the former is much more significant.) The amplitude\nof the soft seed photon contribution and the weakness of an\nadditional unscattered high temperature disk would indicate\na 'recondensed' disk region of only modest extent, predominantly within the confines of a more extended corona, from\nwhich we would expect little iron line contribution.\nOn the other hand, these spectral fits do require an additional, unscattered low temperature disk component. The values of Adisk2 presented in Table 4 correspond to inner disk radii\nof \u2248 2\u201310 GM/c2, given a distance of 2.3 kpc, a black hole\nmass of 10 M\u2299 , and an inclination of 35\u25e6 . This is roughly\nconsistent with the inner radius of the fitted broad Fe line\nand relativistically smeared reflector, for which we find values ranging from Rin = 6\u201318 GM/c2 . (The inner emission radius of the line appears to be uncorrelated with the inner radius implied by the normalization of the low temperature disk\ncomponent.) These radii values are roughly consistent with\nvalues close to the marginally stable orbit of a Schwarzschild\nblack hole.\nThe broad line amplitude is between 6\u201322 times the amplitude of the narrow line component. Fitted reflection fractions\nare \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2248 0.2.\nComparable high seed photon temperature fits were found\nby Wilms et al. (2006) when considering solely RXTE spectra. The major difference between those fits and the ones discussed here is that our prior fits also required a significant contribution from an unscattered, high temperature disk. It is unclear whether that difference is due to the inclusion of Suzaku\ndata that extend to lower energies, the inclusion here of ionized absorption, or the fact that these spectra are for the most\n\n13\n\npart fainter and harder than those discussed by Wilms et al.\n(2006). The coronal compactnesses found here are comparable to the maximum values from our previous studies, while\nthe seed optical depths are slightly lower (by \u2248 0.3\u20130.5 for\ncomparable observations). These values of seed optical depth\nand compactness correspond to coronal temperatures of 85\u2013\n115 keV and total optical depths of 1.1-1.4. The fitted reflection fractions are slightly higher here (by \u2248 0.05) than those\nfits with comparable lh /ls from Wilms et al. (2006).\nWe have found a set of Comptonization model solutions\nthat do allow for a low seed photon temperature. For these\nfits, we include only one extra unscattered disk component\n(with its peak temperature tied to the peak seed photon temperature), and we further tie the inner disk radius to the inner\nradii of the eqpair reflector and the diskline emissivity.\nThat is, we are explicitly mimicking the \"sphere+disk\" geometry (albeit not in a completely self-consistent manner) shown\nin Fig. 9. If we then relax the assumption of a purely thermal\ncoronal electron distribution, good descriptions of the spectra are found with low seed photon temperatures. The ratio\nof non-thermal to total coronal compactness then falls in the\nrange lnt /lh = 0.01\u20130.82. That is, up to 82% of the electron\nenergy (presuming that the thermal and non-thermal electrons\nare cospatial) resides in a powerlaw distribution that extends\nto 1 MeV. Parameters for this model are presented in Table 5\nand spectra are shown in Fig. 11.\nThe quality of these fits is similar to or perhaps slightly\nbetter than that for the thermal corona fits. The fitted compactness parameters for the non-thermal coronae are approximately double those for the thermal fits. (Similar results were\nfound by Ibragimov et al. 2005 when comparing thermal and\nnon-thermal eqpair fits.) At first glance, the optical depths\nseem smaller; however, owing to the large coronal compactnesses pair production is significant and the net optical depths\nrange from 0.7\u20131.6, while the thermal electrons have temperatures that range from 55\u2013160 keV. Reflection fractions are\nslightly larger (by up to 0.09) for these fits. The broad line inner radius in some cases has increased, and now ranges from\n\u2248 6\u201332 GM/c2 . Additionally, the amplitude of the broad line\nis now only 3\u201313 times that of the narrow line. This difference compared to the thermal corona model is due to two factors: the narrow line amplitude is slightly increased, while the\nbroad line amplitude in two cases is nearly halved.\nWe briefly consider one other thermal Comptonization solution that allows for a low seed photon temperature. (No \"toy\ngeometry\" for this model is shown in Fig. 9.) It is a model\nsimilar to that considered by Frontera et al. (2001) when modeling BeppoSAX spectra of Cyg X-1 and to that considered by Makishima et al. (2008) when modeling Suzaku spectra of Cyg X-1. In these models two eqpair components\nare included. They share the same seed photon temperature (tied to the peak temperature of an additional unscattered disk component, as before), and they share the same\nreflection parameters; however, they have independent compactness and optical depths. An example of such a model\nfit is shown in Fig. 12. These fits are generally successful,\nbut no more so than the previous two models. Furthermore,\nowing to the larger degree of freedom given the two semiindependent coronal components, they are fraught with local\nminima representing qualitatively different relative contributions of the two Comptonization components.

Individual model components are shown with\nboth neutral and ionized absorption applied. We show the summed model,\nas well as the the jet synchrotron component, the jet SSC component, the\nCompton corona component, and the disk component.\n\ncussed by Makishima et al. (2008) and Frontera et al. (2001)\ncan allow for both low seed photon temperature and purely\nthermal coronae.\n5.2. Jet Descriptions\n\nThe Compton corona models described above provide a\ngood description of the 0.8\u2013300 keV spectra. These models,\nhowever, are not unique. Even within the restricted class of\ncoronal models, we have shown three qualitatively different\nsolutions that yield comparable fits. Furthermore, none of\nthe Compton corona models give a self-consistent description\nof the correlated radio spectra. Although the four observations discussed here did not have simultaneous radio spectra,\nour prior studies (Gleissner et al. 2004; Nowak et al. 2005;\nWilms et al. 2006) allow us to make good estimates of what\nthe correlated 15 GHz radio flux likely was. We describe this\nestimated joint radio/X-ray spectrum with the jet model of\nMarkoff, Nowak & Wilms (2005) and Maitra et al. (2009).\nIt is important to distinguish the jet models as discussed\nin Markoff et al. (2004, 2005) and later works from the\nearlier iteration of the jet model discussed in Markoff et al.\n(2001, 2003). The 2001/2003 work considered a parameter space where only synchrotron radiation from the jet contributed to the observed X-rays. Later work, and the version\nof the jet model used here, include X-rays produced not only\nby jet synchrotron radiation, but also by jet synchrotron selfCompton processes and Comptonization of seed photons from\nthe disk. The synchrotron component is only mildly beamed,\nwith peak \u03b2 \u223c 2 in the radio emitting portions of the jet. The\ninverse Comptonization component comes from near the jet\nbase where \u03b2 \u223c 0.4, and thus undergoes very little beaming.\nThus, although this does mean that the fitted jet parameters are\ndependent upon assumed inclination angle (e.g., the jet input\npower, Nj will depend upon assumed inclination), given the\nlow \u03b2 values inherent in the model it is possible to find good\nfit parameters for a wide variety of assumed inclinations.\nA full description of the main jet model parameters can be\nfound in the Appendix of Markoff, Nowak & Wilms (2005)\nand in Maitra et al. (2009). The version of the jet model that\nwe use is closest to that discussed in Maitra et al. (2009);\n\ntherefore, we repeat part of the model parameter summary\npresented there. We assume a distance of 2.5 kpc and an inclination of 35\u25e6 for the Cyg X-1 system. The jet properties\nare then determined by the input jet power (N j , expressed as a\nfraction of the Eddington luminosity for a 10 M\u2299 black hole),\nthe electron temperature of the relativistic thermal plasma entering at the jet base (Te ), the ratio of magnetic to particle\nenergy density (the equipartition factor, k), the physical dimensions of the jet base (assumed to be cylindrical with radius R0 and height h0 , the latter fixed to 1.5 R0 ), and the location of the point on the jet (zacc ) beyond which a significant\nfraction of the leptons are accelerated to a powerlaw energy\ndistribution that follows E \u2212p , with p being a fit parameter.\nThe fit parameter \u01ebacc can be physically interpreted as being\nrelated to the particle acceleration rate (which is \u221d \u01eb\u22121\nacc ; see\nMarkoff, Falcke & Fender 2001).\nAs for the corona-only models, we also include emission\nfrom a low temperature disk with inner radius Rin and peak\ntemperature Tdisk1 . (This disk is very similar in temperature\nand normalization to the low temperature disk component included in the Comptonization model fits.) A relativistically\nbroadened Fe K\u03b1 line (with the same emissivity and inclination parameters as for the corona-only models) is coupled to\nthe disk component by having its inner radius of emission tied\nto the disk inner radius. A narrow gaussian line is included, as\nwell as a reflection component (calculated with the reflect\nmodel from XSPEC). Unlike the reflection model internal to\nthe eqpair code, the reflect model, which performs a\nconvolution on any given input spectrum, does not account\nfor relativistic smearing. The Fe edge near 7.1 keV in this\nunsmeared reflected spectrum can produce a sharp feature not\nseen in the data residuals; therefore, we smear this component\nwith a unit-normalized, \u03c3 = 1 keV gaussian convolution7.\nFit results for this model are presented in Table 6, Fig. 13,\nand Fig. 14. The overall quality of these fits is quite good,\nalthough not quite as good as for the corona-only models discussed above. The jet models leave slightly larger residuals\nin the PCA spectra (near the Fe line region and the 10 keV\nregion), as well as in the GSO spectra. The former could be\nrelated to inadequate modeling of the reflection spectrum (i.e.,\nnot using a relativistically smeared model).\nFits to the hardest X-ray spectra (i.e., the cutoff seen in the\nGSO) are governed by the jet SSC and the inverse Compton components. This latter component is comprised of a\nmagnetized, beamed corona with a high temperature [\u2248 (3\u2013\n5) \u00d7 1010 K, i.e., \u2248 3\u20135 MeV], and low electron scattering optical depth (\u03c4es <\n\u223c 0.01). A high temperature, low optical depth\ncorona with a limited residence time under those conditions\nsimplifies the jet code by allowing one to use a single scattering approximation for calculating the Comptonization spectrum. The compactness of such a corona, however, could lead\nto high pair production which would then serve to cool the\ncorona and increase its optical depth (see, for example, the\ncritique of Malzac, Belmont & Fabian 2009).\n7 Kernels for relativistic smearing do exist, e.g., the models of\nBrenneman & Reynolds (2006) and Dauser et al. (2010). The jet model calculations, however, are already substantially slower than the Compton corona\ncalculations. Coupling them with the computationally expensive relativistic kernel would make the fits discussed here prohibitively time consuming to run. Furthermore, the jet model reflection geometry is likely more\ncomplex than that of the standard Compton corona: it should have separate\ncontributions for the synchrotron, SSC, and Comptonized disk photons (see\nMarkoff & Nowak 2004). For these reasons we chose a very simple smearing\nprofile.\n\n\f1\n\nObs. 2\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\n10\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nObs. 4\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nObs. 3\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\n15\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nObs. 1\n\nRatio\n0.9 1 1.1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bd (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n10\u22129\n10\u22128\n\nObservations of the Cygnus X-1 Hard State\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nF IG . 14.- Same as Fig. 10, but for the jet model fits. The following model components are shown: the summed model with the reflection component excluded,\nthe reflection component by itself, the broad and narrow Fe K\u03b1 line components, the jet synchrotron component (which dominates the 2\u201310 keV spectra for\nobservations 1,2, and 4), the jet SSC component (which dominates the 100\u2013300 keV spectra for observations 1,2, and 4), and the disk component. Neutral and\nionized absorption are applied to all shown model components.\n\nPost-facto estimates of the physical self-consistency of fitted jet models are discussed by Maitra et al. (2009) who calculate the pair production and annihilation rates at the base of\nthe corona. Fits to the hard state spectra of XTE J1181+105\nyield far higher annihilation rates than production rates, and\ntherefore represent a self-consistent solution. Fits to the hard\nstate spectra of GX 339\u22124 yield mixed results. For some\ncases, annihilation and production rates are comparable and\nthe resulting corona is marginally self-consistent. In other\ncases, the calculated production rates are an order of magnitude higher than annihilation rates, and the resulting coronae\nare not self-consistent (Maitra et al. 2009).\nWe have performed the same calculations as discussed by\nMaitra et al. (2009) for jet models fitted in this work and find\nthat all yield pair production rates larger than pair annihilation\nrates. The coronae within these jet models are therefore not\nself-consistent. Observation 3 produces a fit that is closest to\nbeing self-inconsistent, with pair production and annihilation\nrates being a factor \u2248 10 apart from one another. Jet fits to the\nother observations are further from self-consistency.\n\nSuch inconsistencies were similarly true for early\ncoronal models, e.g., those based upon the work of\nHaardt & Maraschi (1991). A number of such \"slab geometry\" coronae, in order to produce the hardest X-ray spectra\nobserved in sources such as Cyg X-1, used coronal temperatures (apart from any consideration of pair production) that\nwere unachievable in those geometries (see the discussion of\nthis issue by Dove, Wilms & Begelman 1997). Such inconsistencies were in fact what led to the development of more\nphysically self-consistent coronal models, e.g., the kotelp\nmodel of Stern et al. (1995) and Dove et al. (1997) and the\neqpair model of Coppi (1999).\nWe consider these jet models, however, as they are as of\nyet the only spectral models that make a serious attempt\nto explain the correlated radio spectra. Future iterations of\nthese models will incorporate consideration of pair production, as well as synchrotron and SSC cooling of the Compton corona (Pe'er & Markoff, in prep.). (As shown by\nDove, Wilms & Begelman 1997 and others, coronal cooling\ncan be a more significant consideration than pair production\n\n\f16\n\nNowak et al.\n\nin some situations.)\nThe derived parameters are similar to those found for fits\nto other BHC (see the fits to XTE J1118+105 and GX 339\u22124\npresented by Maitra et al. 2009). The power input at the base\nof the jet, in terms of Eddington luminosity, is comparable to\nthe inferred bolometric luminosity (i.e., compare the values\nof Nj to the values of Table 2; although different inclination\nassumptions will alter the value of Nj , given the low \u03b2 values\nin the jet, it is always comparable to the inferred system luminosity). The radius of the base of the jet is comparable to\nthe radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The\nlargest fit value exceeds the ISCO for a Schwarzschild black\nhole by only a factor of 11. The shock acceleration distance\nalong the jet, zacc ranges from \u2248 60\u2013430 GM/c2 . The former\nvalue is comparable to that found for XTE J1118+105, while\nthe latter is comparable to that found for GX 339\u22124. As discussed above, the fitted coronal electron temperatures at the\nbase of the jet range from \u2248 (3\u20135) \u00d7 1010 K. Work in progress\nsuggests that a physically self-consistent coronal temperature\nthat properly accounts for the dominant effects of synchrotron\nand SSC cooling may truncate the allowed range of coronal\ntemperatures to the lower end found here (Pe'er & Markoff,\nin prep.). Future versions of the jet code will explicitly account for these effects.\nFor all the fits presented in Fig. 14, both synchrotron and\nSSC radiation make substantial contributions to observed Xray spectra. This is an important point to which we shall return in \u00a76.\n5.3. Comparison of Implied Relativistic Lines\n\nIn Fig. 15 we show the Fe line region residuals for the two\nCompton corona models and the jet model. These residuals\nare derived by setting the line normalizations (including absorption line normalizations) to zero, without refitting. They\nare also different from line residuals that are often used for\nillustrative purposes where only a portion of the continuum\noutside of the line region is fit with a simple powerlaw (e.g.,\nFig. 7). The residuals in Fig. 15 are meant to highlight the\ndifferences in the derived line parameters for the three main\ncontinuum models discussed here.\nAs shown by the parameters in Tables 4\u20136, there are indeed differences among the inferred line parameters. For the\nmost part, the purely thermal Comptonization model yields\nthe strongest line equivalent widths, while the non-thermal\nComptonization model yields the weakest equivalent widths\n(by up to a factor of two). The thermal Comptonization model\nusually also yields the smallest inner radii for the relativistically broadened line, in some cases extending all the way to\nthe ISCO for a Schwarzschild black hole. Larger values of\nthese radii, however, are typically found with the other two\nmodels. These differences are evident in the lower energy\nresiduals shown in Fig. 7.\nTo be clear, a substantially broadened line is required by\nall spectral models that we have explored, and there is a good\nagreement between the PCA and Suzaku -XIS residuals regarding this fact. We also reiterate that for all explored models, the equivalent width of the fitted narrow line (typically\n< 15 eV) is only a fraction of that for the broad line, and is in\nfact substantially smaller than the Fe line equivalent width we\nhave found for any model that we have applied to any RXTE\nobservation of Cyg X-1 (Wilms et al. 2006). Furthermore, for\nthese four observations, we have not found any implied inner\nradius greater than \u2248 40 GM/c2 . The precise details of this\n\nbroadened line, however, do depend upon the assumed continuum model.\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this work we present broad band (0.8\u2013300 keV) fits to\nfour separate observations of Cyg X-1 that have simultaneous\nSuzaku and RXTE data. The most recent of these observations also has simultaneous Chandra -HETG data. Each of\nthese observations shows evidence of dipping events likely\ndue to dense structures (\"clumps\") in the otherwise highly\nionized wind of the secondary. This is seen in the lightcurves\n(Figs. 1), and the color-color diagrams (Fig. 2, which can\nbe modeled by the presence of a dust scattering halo). The\nionized absorption is very significant in the Suzaku spectra\n(Fig. 5) even though in this work we consider the least absorbed periods of the lightcurve.\n\u2022 Modeling the ionized line absorption present in Cyg X1, via the use of parameterized fits to the HETG spectra,\nis crucial for deriving good fits to the soft X-ray spectra\nseen by Suzaku and RXTE .\nWe note that even accounting for this ionized absorption,\nthe spectral fits presented in this paper yield reduced \u03c72\u03bd that\nrange from 1.8\u20132.5. Do such values truly represent good fits\nto these data? Cyg X-1 is bright, and these observations are of\nsufficient length that the signal-to-noise values for these spectra are quite high. The spectra are dominated by systematic\nerrors, especially at the soft X-ray energies. We already have\nadded 0.5% systematic errors to the PCA spectra, which is a\nreasonable estimate for the internal uncertainty of the PCA.\nThere are also relative uncertainties among the detectors. For\nobservation 4, if we increase the PCA systematic errors to 1%,\nadd 1% systematic errors to the HEXTE A cluster (i.e., the\nfixed cluster), and add 3% systematic errors to the Suzaku XIS spectra, then the fits presented here would have reduced\n\u03c72\u03bd \u2248 1. Comparing the fits among the individual XIS spectra\n(representing both different individual detectors and different\ndata acquisition modes), we have found that \u00b13% is a reasonable estimate of the end-to-end differences among these\nspectra. We hypothesize that the quality of the fits presented\nhere is near \"optimal\" given the current internal and relative\ncalibrations of these detectors.\nThe observations that occurred on 2007 May 17, i.e., the\nthird set of observations, are potentially the most problematic in turns of cross-calibration issues. For our other sets\nof observations, the RXTE -PCA data act as a \"bridge\" between the Suzaku -XIS and -PIN spectra. Each can have its\nrelative normalization anchored by a comparison to the PCA,\nwhich overlaps the energy coverage of both detectors. This\nis lacking in the third observation, leading to the worry that\nchanges in the normalization constant are subsuming, for example, continuum spectra associated with the spectral break\nat \u2248 10 keV. For the third observation, we find the ratio of the\nPIN to XIS 1 normalization constant to range from 1.10\u20131.17.\nThis is to be compared to the 1.16\u20131.18 value found for fits to\nthe first observation, the 1.06\u20131.08 found for the second observation, and the 1.10\u20131.11 found for the fourth observation.\nThe expected value8 for the PIN/XIS 0 comparison is 1.16.\nThere is some amount of scatter for the cross-normalization\nvalues among the different observations; however, the first,\n8 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/analysis/\nwatchout.html. Since we did not fit XIS 0 data for the fourth observation, here we compare to XIS 1.\n\n\f5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n1.1\n\n17\n\n1\n\nRatio\n1.05\n\n1.1\nRatio\n1.05\n1\n\n1\n\nRatio\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\nObservations of the Cygnus X-1 Hard State\n\n5\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\n6\nEnergy (keV)\n\n7\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\nF IG . 15.- Fe K\u03b1 line region residuals for observation 4, obtained from our best fits by setting the broad and narrow line normalizations (including the\nnormalization of the Fe XXV absorption line) to zero. Left: the high kTseed eqpair fit, the hybrid thermal/non-thermal eqpair fit, and the jet model fit. (Purple\ncircles are the RXTE residuals, while the blue histograms are the Suzaku residuals.)\n\nsecond, and fourth observations show little scatter in its value\nfor different fits to the same data. More scatter is seen for\nthe third observation; therefore, additional systematic uncertainties need to be considered as being present for that set of\nobservations.\nUsing simple broken powerlaw and exponentially cutoff\npowerlaw fits, we find that these spectra are among the hardest\nseen in the \"low hard state\" of Cyg X-1 over the past decade.\nFor all four observations, the spectra are clearly detected out\nto 300 keV with the GSO, and exponential cutoffs are well\nconstrained.\n\u2022 Although these are among the hardest Cyg X-1 spectra\never detected, the exponential folding energies vary by\nover a factor 1.5, and range from 160\u2013250 keV.\nHistorically observed hard state spectra in Cyg X-1 have\nshown folding energies that vary over a slightly wider range,\nwhile hard state BHC as a class show folding energies that\nspan a factor of 5.\nAs these spectra are among the faintest and hardest for\nCyg X-1, they make excellent test beds for theoretical models\nthat posit, for instance, that the hard state represents a configuration with an inner disk that has evaporated into a quasispherical corona. In such a scenario, we might expect these\nspectra to show the most \"extreme\" recession of the inner\ndisk, although we have noted that the bolometric luminosities represented by these spectra only span a factor of two. At\na few percent of the Eddington luminosity, they are not far\nbelow the expected soft-to-hard state transition. Numerous\ntransient BHC sources show much fainter hard states as they\nfade into quiescence.\nWe have presented a number of different spectral models,\nall of which describe the 0.8\u2013300 keV spectra well. Some of\nthese models describe the X-ray spectra primarily with Comptonization components (whether due to a thermal or hybrid\nthermal/non-thermal corona), while the jet model is dominated by synchrotron and SSC emission from the jet. All of\nthese models have a number of features in common.\n\u2022 All models require a soft excess that here we describe\nwith a disk component with low (kTdisk \u2248 200 eV) peak\ntemperature. The implied inner radii of these disks\nrange from 2\u201340 GM/c2 .\n\u2022 All models require a relativistically broadened line\ncomponent. The inner emission radius of this broadened line never exceeds \u2248 40 GM/c2 , but for some\nmodels is as low as 6 GM/c2 .\n\n\u2022 All models require a reflection component. The typical\nvalues for the reflection fraction are \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2248 0.2\u20130.3.\n\u2022 All models imply that the spectral hardening at \u2248\n10 keV is not solely due to reflection.\nThis latter point is very important, and broadly agrees\nwith similar conclusions drawn by Frontera et al. (2001),\nIbragimov et al. (2005), and Makishima et al. (2008). The\npresence of the broad Fe line and some of the spectral curvature in the 20\u2013300 keV band is a clear indication of the presence of reflection. However, this reflection spectrum is not sitting on top of a simple \"disk+powerlaw\" spectrum. There\nis additional continuum complexity separate from reflection\nthat contributes to this perceived break. A high seed photon\ntemperature in the thermal corona model yields a soft excess\nin the 2-10 keV band and thus contributes to the measured\nbreak in that scenario. (See the discussion in Wilms et al.\n2006.) As has been discussed by Ibragimov et al. (2005), a\nnon-thermal electron population in the corona can lead to a\nsoft excess in the 2\u201310 keV band that helps contribute to what\notherwise would be modeled as a reflection break at 10 keV.\nThe two corona model discussed by Makishima et al. (2008),\na version of which is shown in Fig. 12, rather explicitly replaces part of the reflection component with a broad band\ncontinuum model. Finally, in the jet paradigm the spectral\nbreak at 10 keV is partly attributable to the transition from\ndominance by synchrotron emission to SSC emission in the\ncontinuum.\nThere are plausible physical scenarios for each of the\ndiscussed spectral models, with some hypothesized geometries being shown in Fig. 9. The hybrid thermal/nonthermal coronal model is the closest to the concept\nof the quasi-spherical inner corona with outer geometrically thin disk (e.g., Eardley, Lightman & Shaipro\n1975; Shapiro, Lightman & Eardley 1976; Ichimaru 1977;\nDove et al. 1997, etc.). We have only been able to find such\nsolutions, however, when invoking a partly non-thermal electron population in the corona.\nThe purely thermal coronal model contains two disk components that are reminiscent of the physical description given\nby Mayer & Pringle (2007). These authors describe a situation where an outer, geometrically thin, cool disk surrounds\nan inner, geometrically thick, hot corona. In the very inner\nradii of this corona, however, thermal conduction leads to it\ncondensing into a geometrically thin and optically thick disk\n(see Fig. 9). Such a component could supply the high temperature seed photons in our thermal corona solutions, while\n\n\f18\n\nNowak et al.\n\nthe lower temperature outer disk could provide the bulk of the\nreflection features. The jet model has a natural physical interpretation in that the usually observed optically thick radio\nspectrum observed in the hard state is clear indication of the\npresence of a jet. The question that remains is the contribution\nof this component to the X-ray band.\nThe fact that the continuum is more complex than a simple\n\"disk+powerlaw\", yet there are multiple, physically motivated models that yield comparably good spectral fits, leads\nto the final point.\n\u2022 Although a relativistically broadened line is required in\nall of our spectral models, the parameters of this line\nare dependent upon the presumed continuum model.\nCoupled with this dependence upon assumed continuum spectrum is an implicit dependence upon ionized absorption, for\nwhich we have detailed Chandra -HETG measurements for\nonly the fourth observation9. Again, we have not found an\ninner radius for this line that exceeds \u2248 40 GM/c2 . Given the\nvariations of this line with presumed continuum, however, we\nare as of yet unable to use this line for more refined diagnostics such as estimates of black hole spin.\nAlthough we are unable as of yet to draw firm conclusions\nas to the best geometry and physical mechanisms to describe\nthe hard state spectra of Cyg X-1, these new joint Suzaku RXTE data provide a stunning contrast to our prior results\nusing solely RXTE data (Wilms et al. 2006). For the RXTE\ndata alone we were able to describe the 3\u2013125 keV spectra\n\nwith a variety of physically motivated Comptonization models and to describe correlations among the fit parameters. On\nthe other hand, the simple exponentially cutoff, broken powerlaw models with a single, broad gaussian line described the\ndata equally well, if not better (Wilms et al. 2006). When considering the 0.8\u2013300 keV Suzaku -RXTE data discussed here,\nthis is no longer the case. We now require complex absorption\nat low energy, an asymmetric broad line plus narrow emission and absorption components in the Fe line region, and a\ncomplex continuum model. The catalog of Suzaku observations of BHC will continue to increase such that we observe\na wider variety of BHC states and luminosities. Furthermore\nthe sophistication and physical self-consistency of the spectral models will continue to improve. Together, they offer the\npromise of obtaining a better understanding of the physical\nprocesses occurring in these BHC systems.\nWe would like to thank the RXTE , Suzaku , and Chandra schedulers for making these simultaneous observations\npossible.

The tools, descriptions of their use, and example results can be found at: http://space.mit.edu/ASC/software/suzaku. The former\ntool further corrects the Suzaku attitude solution, whereas the latter estimates the degree of pileup in a given subset of the observation. Both are scripts written in S-Lang but are designed to be run on a terminal command line using ISIS, the Interactive\nSpectral Analysis System (Houck & Denicola 2000), as a driver. For all intents and purposes, the scripts behave similar to the\ntypical Unix command line tools found in the HEASOFT package.\nThermal flexing of the Suzaku spacecraft leads to a slow wobbling of the optical axis, and hence blurring of the image.\nCurrent Suzaku tools partially correct this effect by adjusting the spacecraft attitude file based upon details of the spacecraft\norbit, temperature, etc. (Uchiyama et al. 2008). aeattcor.sl further improves this correction (Fig. 16) for a bright source by\nusing its time-dependent detected image to create a new attitude file. Specifically, the tool attempts to shift the time-dependent\nmean detector image position to a new specified, fixed sky position. It presumes that there are no intrinsic variations in the timedependent image position. (A mean image position may be time varying, for example, if it is comprised of two or more variable\nsources of comparable flux. Additionally, a highly variable and piled up source where an \"image crater\" appears and disappears\nover the course of the observation may lead to a variable mean image position.) The bin time over which the tool searches for\nand shifts the image peak is a user selectable parameter; however, we have used the default of 100 seconds.\nWe applied the tool to detector images that first underwent the standard attitude correction process (Uchiyama et al. 2008). We\nchose circular regions with radius \u2248 2\u2032 that were visually centered on the source image. The tool then created a new attitude\ncorrection file, which we applied with the xiscoord tool. All of our attitude correction files were created using solely the XIS\n1 images.\nPileup occurs in CCD detectors when two or more photons fall on the same or neighboring pixels during the same\nreadout frame, and therefore are read as a single higher energy photon or are discarded as a bad event (Davis 2001).\npile_estimate.sl was run after aeattcor.sl, as uncorrected blurring leads to an underestimate of the degree of pileup.\nThe tool first creates a lightcurve in three energy bands, using both rate and counts. Here we used the default values of 0.5\u2013\n1.5 keV, 1.5\u20133 keV, and 3\u20139 keV for the energy bands and 32 seconds for the time bins. These data are then passed to the vwhere\n(Noble 2005) filtering tool. The vwhere tool was used to create the color-intensity diagrams shown in Fig. 2), and it was used\nto select times of approximately uniform rates and colors (see \u00a73). These time selections were then written to a filter file used for\nsubsequent data extraction using the xselect tool.\nA box-car smoothed (3\u00d73 pixel bins) image is displayed using the ds9 tool, with the image rescaled to the estimated pile up\nfraction. Pile up fraction here is defined to be the ratio of events lost via grade or energy migration to the events expected in the\nabsence of pileup. Furthermore, the pile up fraction is based upon the mean counts per 3\u00d73 pixel region per readout frame. The\nimage displays discrete steps that represent the minimum pileup fraction in the displayed region, with the exception of the highest\ndisplayed value. This value corresponds to the image maximum, and is shown over regions at this maximum down to half way\ntowards the next lowest displayed value.\n\u2032\u2032\nUsing this image, we chose to exclude the central regions with pile up fractions >\n\u223c 10% (Fig. 16). Typically, this was an \u2248 20\nradius region, comprising \u2248 1/3 of the detected events. The pile_estimate.sl tool then gives an estimate of the mean level\nof the remaining pile up fraction in the image, which for these data was typically < 4%.\n\n\f20\n\nNowak et al.\n\nF IG . 16.- Left: An example of Suzaku attitude correction. The left half of the image shows a Cyg X-1 image using the standard attitude correction. The right\nhalf of the image shows the improvement with aeattcorr.sl. Right: An image of Cyg X-1 where discrete colors correspond to the pileup in that region. The\nouter white circle denotes the outer boundary of an annular extraction region, and the inner white circle denotes the inner boundary. Pileup fractions within this\nexcluded region are as high as 35%. The average effective residual pileup level is < 4%.\n\n\f20\n\nTABLE 4\nPARAMETERS FOR THERMAL C OMPTONIZATION SPECTRAL FITS\nDate\n(yyyy-mm-dd)\n\nNH\n(1022 cm!2 )\n\nAeqp\n(10!3 )\n\nlh /ls\n\n\u03c4p\n\n\u03a9/2\u03c0\n\n\u03be\n(4\u03c0Fion /n)\n\nRin\n(GM/c2 )\n\nAdisk1\n\nkTdisk1\n(keV)\n\nAdisk2\n(104 )\n\nkTdisk2\n(keV)\n\nAdiskline\n(10!3 )\n\nAline\n(10!4 )\n\nClines\n\n\u03c72 /DoF\n\n2006-10-30\n2007-04-30\n2007-05-17\n2008-04-19\n\n0.72+0.01\n!0.01\n0.82+0.01\n!0.01\n0.63+0.04\n!0.02\n0.82+0.04\n!0.03\n\n+0.001\n5.007!0.001\n3.586+0.003\n!0.004\n+0.001\n1.573!0.021\n7.816+0.007\n!0.102\n\n7.47+0.01\n!0.01\n7.55+0.02\n!0.02\n6.61+0.31\n!0.25\n6.95+0.08\n!0.08\n\n1.446+0.005\n!0.005\n1.228+0.005\n!0.005\n0.976+0.029\n!0.025\n1.431+0.002\n!0.009\n\n0.194+0.002\n!0.001\n0.219+0.003\n!0.002\n0.210+0.028\n!0.025\n0.238+0.011\n!0.009\n\n1000!33\n1000!79\n1000!83\n732+132\n!122\n\n+0.1\n17.4!0.1\n8.9+0.1\n!0.1\n6.0+0.5\n6.0+0.3\n\n+0.7\n14.5!1.4\n0.0+0.3\n0.0+0.7\n39.5+2.6\n!8.0\n\n0.848+0.001\n!0.001\n0.986+0.001\n!0.001\n1.130+0.051\n!0.098\n0.852+0.035\n!0.001\n\n4.18+0.02\n!0.04\n13.8+0.2\n!0.1\n1.18+0.02\n!0.45\n29.2+11.3\n!7.3\n\n0.258+0.001\n!0.001\n0.191+0.001\n!0.001\n0.250+0.018\n!0.031\n0.197+0.001\n!0.002\n\n6.3+0.7\n!0.3\n5.0+0.4\n!0.4\n4.4+0.6\n!0.7\n9.2+1.0\n!1.4\n\n8.2+3.1\n!1.8\n8.7+1.5\n!1.6\n2.0+2.0\n!1.8\n6.5+3.5\n!4.1\n\n0.39+0.03\n!0.02\n0.93+0.02\n!0.03\n0.53+0.08\n!0.08\n1.07+0.01\n!0.02\n\n2469/975\n2035/842\n851/483\n1610/843\n\nN OTE. - See text for a description of the model.
