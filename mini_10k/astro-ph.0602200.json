Introduction\nQuasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are a common phenomenon in nature. In the last few years many kHz QPOs\nhave been detected in the light curves of about 20 neutron star and few black hole sources (for a recent review,\nsee van der Klis 2004). The nature of these QPOs is\none of the mysteries which still puzzle and intrigue astrophysicists: apart from giving important insights into the\ndisk structure and the mass and spin of the central object\n(e.g. Abramowicz & Klu\u017aniak 2001; Aschenbach 2004;\nT\u00f6r\u00f6k et al. 2005), they offer an unprecedented chance\nto test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in strong\nfields.\nHigh frequency QPOs lie in the range of orbital\nfrequencies of geodesics just few Schwarzschild radii\noutside the central source. This feature inspired several models based directly on orbital motion (e.g.\nStella & Vietri 1998; Lamb & Miller 2003), but there\nare also models that are based on accretion disk oscillations (Wagoner et al. 2001; Kato 2001; Rezzolla et al.\n\n2003; Li & Narayan 2004). The Klu\u017aniak & Abramowicz\nresonance model (see a collection of review articles in\nAbramowicz 2005) stresses the importance of the observed 3:2 ratio, pointing out that the commensurability\nof frequencies is a clear signature of a resonance. The relevance of the 3 : 2 ratio and its intimate bond with the\nQPOs fundamental nature is supported also by recent observations: Jeroen Homan of MIT reported at the AAS\nmeeting on the 9th of January 2006 that the black hole\ncandidate GRO J1655\u221240 showed in 2005 the same QPOs\n(at \u223c 300 Hz and \u223c 450 Hz) first detected by Strohmayer\n(2001).\nThe main limitation of the resonance model is that\nit does not yet explain the nature of the physical mechanism that excites the resonance. The idea that turbulence excites the resonance and feeds energy into it (e.g.\nAbramowicz 2005) is the most natural one, but it has\nnever been explored in detail. The turbulence in accretion disks is most probably due to the Magneto-Rotational\nInstability (MRI; Balbus & Hawley 1991). At present,\n\n\f2\n\nR. Vio et al.: Stochastic modelling of QPOs\n\nnumerical simulations of turbulence in accretion disks do\nnot fully control all the physics near the central source.\nFor this reason, they cannot yet address the question of\nwhether MRI turbulence does play a role in exciting and\nfeeding the 3 : 2 parametric resonance. A situation like\nthis is not specific of astronomy, but it is shared by other\nfields in applied research and engineering. The most common and, at the same time, effective, solution consists of\nmodelling the unknown processes as stochastic ones. Such\nprocesses are characterized by a huge number of degrees\nof freedom and therefore they can be assumed to have a\nstochastic nature (e.g. Garcia-Okjalvo & Sancho 1999).\nLacking any a priori knowledge, the most natural choice is\nrepresented by Gaussian white-noise processes. Of course,\nsuch an assumption is only an approximation. However,\nit can provide an idea of the consequences on the system of interest of the action of a large number of complex\nprocesses. This approach leads to the modelling of physical systems by means of stochastic differential equations\n(SDE) (Maybeck 1979, 1982; Ghanem & Spanos 1991;\nGarcia-Okjalvo & Sancho 1999; Vio et al. 2005).\nThe present paper is a first qualitative step in this\ndirection in the context of QPO modelling. In Sec. 2\nwe synthesize a stochastic version of the non-linear resonance model. Some experiments are presented and discussed in Sec. 3. The last section summarizes our findings.\nSince SDEs are not yet very well known in astronomy,\nAppendix A provides a brief description of the techniques\nfor the numerical integration that are relevant for practical\napplications.\nIn all the experiments, we adopt the units rG =\n2GM/c2 = 1 and c = 1.\n\n2.2. Dynamics of a test particle\nA simple mathematical approach to this idea was first\ndeveloped by Rebusco (2004) and Hor\u00e1k (2004), in the\ncontext of isolated test particle dynamics.\nThe time evolution of perturbed nearly Keplerian\ngeodesics is given by\nz\u0308(t) + \u03c9\u03b82 z(t) = f [\u03c1(t), z(t), r0 , \u03b80 ];\n\u03c1\u0308(t) +\n\n\u03c9r2 \u03c1(t)\n\n= g[\u03c1(t), z(t), r0 , \u03b80 ].\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nHere \u03c1(t) and z(t) denote small deviations from the circular orbit r0 , \u03b80 (radial and the vertical coordinates respectively), f and g account for the coupling, and \u03c9\u03b8\nand \u03c9r are the epicyclic frequencies. In the case of the\nSchwarzschild metric, a Taylor expansion to third order\nleads to:\nf (\u03c1, z, r0 ,\u03b80 )\n= c11 z\u03c1 + cb \u017c \u03c1\u0307 + c21 \u03c12 z + c1b \u03c1\u017c \u03c1\u0307 + c03 z 3 ; (3)\ng(\u03c1, z, r0 ,\u03b80 ) = e02 z 2 + e20 \u03c12 + ez2 \u017c 2 + e30 \u03c13\n+ e1ze2 \u03c1\u017c 2 + e12 \u03c1z 2 + er2 \u03c1\u03072 + e1re2 \u03c1\u03072 \u03c1.\n\n(4)\n\nThe functional form of the coefficients ci and ej can\nbe found in Rebusco (2004). They are constants, which\ndepend on r0 , the distance of the unperturbed orbit\nfrom the centre. In previous studies these non-linear\ndifferential equations have been integrated numerically\n(Abramowicz et al. 2003) and analyzed through a perturbative method. These coupled harmonic oscillators display internal non-linear resonance, the strongest one occurs when \u03c9\u03b8 : \u03c9r = 3 : 2 and the observed frequencies\nare close (but not equal) to the epicyclic ones.\n\n2.3. Additional terms\n2. A simplified model for kHz QPOs\n2.1. The Klu\u017aniak-Abramowicz idea\nThe key point of the mechanism proposed by\nAbramowicz & Klu\u017aniak (2001) is the observation\nthat kHz QPOs often occur in pairs, and that the\ncentroid frequencies of these pairs are in a rational\nratio (e.g., Strohmayer 2001). This feature suggested\nto them that high frequency QPOs are a phenomenon\ndue to non-linear resonance. The analogy of radial and\nvertical fluctuations in a Shakura-Sunyaev disk with the\nMathieu equation pointed out that the smallest (and\nhence strongest) possible resonance is the 3 : 2. In all\nfour micro-quasars which exhibit double peaks, the ratio\nof the two frequencies is 3 : 2, as well as in many neutron\nstar sources. Moreover, combinations of frequencies and\nsub-harmonics have been detected: these are all signatures\nof non-linear resonance. A confirmation of the fact that\nkHz QPOs are due to orbital oscillations comes from the\nscaling of the frequencies with 1/M , where M is the mass\nof the central object (McClintock & Remillard 2004).\n\nAs we have seen the perturbation of geodesics opens\nup the possibility of internal resonances. However these\nepicyclic oscillations would not be detectable without\nany source of energy to make their amplitudes grow.\nIn Abramowicz et al. (2003) and Rebusco (2004) this\nsource of energy was inserted by introducing a parameter \u03b1. The effect of forcing (e.g., due to the neutron star\nspin), and its potential to produce new (external) resonances, have been addressed recently (e.g. Abramowicz\n2005). The main limit in the approach proposed by\nAbramowicz et al. (2003) and Rebusco (2004) is that it\nrepresents an ad hoc solution. Moreover, as stressed in\nSec. 1, it does not consider the many processes that take\nplace in the central region of an accretion disk as, for example, MRI-driven turbulence (Balbus & Hawley 1991).\nFor this reason, we propose the stochasticized version of\nEqs. (1)-(2)\nz\u0308(t) + \u03c9\u03b82 z(t) \u2212 f [\u03c1(t), z(t), r0 , \u03b80 ] = \u03c3z \u03b2;\n\u03c1\u0308(t) +\n\n\u03c9r2 \u03c1(t)\n\n\u2212 g[\u03c1(t), z(t), r0 , \u03b80 ] = 0,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwith \u03c3z a constant and \u03b2(t) a continuous, zero mean, unit\nvariance, Gaussian white-noise process.\n\n\fR.

Resonant frequencies (apart from the epicyclic\nones) for different initial conditions (1, 2, 3) and noise standard deviation (\u03c3z = 0, 10\u22125, 10\u22124 ).\n\nThere is no full understanding of turbulence in accretion disks. We know that the radial component is fundamental in producing the effective viscosity which allows accretion to occur, and that MRI-turbulence should\nbe different in the vertical and radial direction. Here\nwe make a first step by introducing a noise term only\nalong the vertical direction: in the end this ansatz alone\ngives interesting results. In the Shakura & Sunyaev model\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) the turbulent viscosity is\nparametrized via the famous \u03b1SS . It is reasonable to assume that \u03c3z is at maximum a fraction, smaller than \u03b1SS ,\nof the disk height. Hence for a geometrically thin disk one\nwould expect a maximum \u03c3z \u223c 10\u22124 \u201310\u22123 . As shown in\nAppendix A, the smallness of the stochastic perturbation\npermits the development of efficient integration schemes\nfor the numerical integration of the system (5)-(6).\n\n3. Results\nWe explored the dynamics of the test particle for different\nvalues of \u03c3z and initial conditions z(0) and \u03c1(0). All the\nintegrations are performed by means of the scheme (A.14)(A.18), with h = 5\u00d710\u22124 and t = 105 , for r0 = 27/5 which\nis the value for which the unperturbed frequencies are in\na 3 : 2 ratio. As a sample, three different starting values [z(0), \u017c(0), \u03c1(0), \u03c1\u0307(0)] have been used: [0.01, 0, 0.01, 0],\n[0.1, 0, 0.1, 0], and [0.2, 0, 0.2, 0], which we refer to as models 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For each of them we considered\nthree values of \u03c3z : 0, 10\u22125 and 10\u22124 . As pointed out in the\nprevious section, a noise level stronger than these is unlike to occur, since it would destabilize the accretion flow.\nMoreover when the initial perturbations z(0) and \u03c1(0) are\ngreater than about 0.5 they diverge, even in absence of\nnoise: this is the limit for which the system can be considered weakly non-linear and physically meaningful.\nThe lower panels of Figs. 1 - 3 show how the amplitudes\nreach greater values for greater noise dispersion. These\nplots are done for the initial conditions 2, but similar behavior is also obtained for different initial conditions: as\nexpected, noise triggers the resonances. With regard to\nthe frequencies at which the resonances are excited, the\ndominant one are always the epicyclic frequencies (the\nstrongest peaks in the upper part of the plots). However,\nthe sub- and super-harmonics also react (see Tab. 1), and\ntheir signal is stronger for greater noise dispersion. As predicted by means of the perturbative method of multiple\nscales, the dominant oscillations have frequencies (\u03c9r\u2217 and\n\u03c9\u03b8\u2217 ), close to the epicyclic ones. The pattern of the other\n\n3\n\nresonances (Tab. 1) is not interesting in itself, as it depends on the initial conditions and on the noise, but it\nis significant from a qualitative point of view, as it is a\nsignature of the non-linear nature of the system.\nWhen the noise is \u223c 10\u22123 or greater the solution diverges, whilst when it is too small (\u223c 10\u22126 ) it does not\ndiffer too much from the results without noise. The exact\nlimit of \u03c3z over which the epicycles are swamped depends\non the initial conditions: it is indeed lower for greater initial conditions, and vice versa.\nIn the case where noise is assumed to be due to MRI\nturbulence, this simple experiment constrains its amplitude: turbulence that is too low does not supply enough\nenergy to the growing resonant modes, whilst too much\nturbulence prevents the quasi-periodic behavior from occurring. From this oversimplified model we get an indication that the standard deviation of vertical MRI must be\n\u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 , which is reasonable since it is comparable\nwith a small fraction of the disk height.\nIn a yet unpublished work (private communication,\nSkinner 2005) considers how far the data from a QPO\nsource can constrain the properties of a simple damped\nharmonic oscillator model - not only its resonant frequency\nand damping but also to some extent the excitation. Not\nunlike the present work, he adds random delta function\nshots to a simple harmonic oscillator equation, changing\nthe amplitude and frequency of shots. He observes that\nthe data constrain the allowed range of parameters for\nthe excitation.\n\n4. Conclusions\nUp to now models for kHz QPOs have been based on deterministic differential equations. The main limits of these\nmodels is that they correspond to unrealistic physical scenarios where the many and complex processes that take\nplace in the central regions of an accretion disk are not\ntaken into account. In this paper, we have partially overcome this problem by adopting an approach based on\nstochastic differential equations. The assumption is that\nthe above mentioned processes are characterized by a huge\nnumber of degrees of freedom, hence they can be assumed\nto have a stochastic nature. In particular, we have investigated a simplified model for the Klu\u017aniak-Abramowicz\nnon-linear theory and shown that a small amount of noise\nin the vertical direction can trigger coupled epicyclic oscillations. On the other hand too much noise would disrupt\nthe quasi-periodic motion. This is similar to the stochastically excited p-modes in the Sun (Goldreich & Keeley\n1977).\nFrom our simple example we get an indication that\nthe standard deviation of vertical noise cannot be greater\nthan 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 rg , nor smaller than \u223c 10\u22126 rg , but\nbetter modelling needs to be done. Nonetheless good estimates are still possible without detailed knowledge of\nall the mechanisms in accretion disks; this approach has\nthe power to lead to a better understanding of both kHz\nQPOs and other astrophysical phenomena.\n\n\f4\n\nR. Vio et al.: Stochastic modelling of QPOs\n\nFig. 1. Numerical simulation of the system (5)-(6). The\nupper panels show the power spectra of z(t) and \u03c1(t),\nwhereas the lower panels show the corresponding phase\ndiagrams. Here \u03c3z = 0 (i.e. noise-free system). The displacements are in units of rg , the frequencies are scaled to\nkHz (e.g. assuming a central mass M of 2M\u2299 ).\n\nFig. 2. The same as in Fig. 1 but with \u03c3z = 10\u22125 .\n\nthe case of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\ndx = a(t, x)dt\n\nAppendix A: Some notes on the numerical\nintegration of SDEs\n\nnumerical integration schemes are, either directly or indirectly, based on a Taylor expansion of the solution\n\nA.1. General remarks\nA generic system of SDEs can be written in the form\n\u1e8b = a(t, x) + \u03a3(t, x)\u03b2\n\n(A.1)\n\nHere x, a are n-dimensional column vectors, \u03b2 is a mdimensional column vector containing zero mean, unit\nvariance, Gaussian white-noise processes and \u03a3 is a n \u00d7 m\nmatrix. Typically, this equation is written in the more rigorous form\ndx = a(t, x)dt + \u03a3(t, x)dw,\nwith solution\nxt = xt0 +\n\nZ\n\nt\n\na(s, xs )ds +\nt0\n\nZ\n\n(A.2)\n\nt\n\n\u03a3(s, xs )dw s .\n\n(A.4)\n\n(A.3)\n\nxt = xt0 +\n\nZ\n\nt\n\na(s, xs )ds.\n\nSomething similar holds also for SDEs. However, the\nstochastic counterpart of the deterministic Taylor expansion is rather complex. In order to understand this\npoint without entering into overly technical arguments,\nit is instructive to compare the expansions relative to a\none-dimensional autonomous version of Eq. (A.4) and of\nEq. (A.2) with m = 1. In this case, for the ODE (A.4)\nthe first-order integral form of the Taylor formula in the\ninterval [t0 , t] is\n\nt0\n\nHere w is a m-dimensional Wiener process. The numerical\nintegration of SDEs is quite a difficult problem. In fact, in\n\n(A.5)\n\nt0\n\nxt = xt0 + a(xt0 )\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\nds + R2 ,\n\n(A.6)\n\n\fR. Vio et al.: Stochastic modelling of QPOs\n\n5\n\nin dealing with them is that they cannot be computed exactly. Unfortunately, in its turn, numerical approximation\nis also a difficult affair.\nThe consequence of this situation is that, even in the\ncase of simple systems, only integration schemes of very\nlow order strong convergence 1 can be used. In fact, for the\nautonomous version of system (A.2) the most commonly\nused technique is the Euler scheme\nx[k+1] = x[k] + a[k] h[k] + \u03a3[k] \u2206w [k] ,\n\n(A.11)\n\nwhere h[k] = t[k+1] \u2212 t[k] is the integration time step at\nthe time t[k] , and the elements of the vector\nZ tk+1\n(A.12)\ndwt = w t[k+1] \u2212 wt[k]\n\u2206w[k] =\ntk\n\nare independent identically-distributed Gaussian random\nvariables with mean equal to zero and variance equal to\nh[k] .\n\nA.2. Small noise approximation\n\nFig. 3. The same as in Fig. 1 but \u03c3z = 10\u22124 . The comparison with the phase diagrams in the previous plots indicates how much the amplitudes grow under the effect of\nslightly stronger noise.\nwhere R2 is the remainder. For the SDE (A.2) the corresponding expansion is\nZ t\nZ t\ndws\n(A.7)\nds + \u03c3(xt0 )\nxt = xt0 + a(xt0 )\nt0\n\n+ \u03c3 \u2032 (xt0 )\u03c3(xt0 )\n\nZ tZ\nt0\n\nt0\n\ns\n\ndwz dws + R\u0304,\n\n(A.8)\n\nt0\n\nwhere the symbol \" \u2032 \" denotes differentiation with respect\nto x, and R\u0304 is the remainder. From Eq. (A.7) it is possible\nto see the presence of the additional terms\nZ tZ s\nZ t\ndws ,\ndwz dws .\n(A.9)\nt0\n\nt0\n\nt0\n\nWhen n, m 6= 1, it is possible to show that in the higher\norder expansions some quantities appear as\nZ t Z sl\nZ s2\ndwsjll ,\ndwsj11 * * * dwsjl\u22121\nI(j1 ,j2 ,*** ,jl ) =\n***\nl\u22121\nt0\n\nt0\n\nt0\n\n(A.10)\nwhere j1 , j2 , * * * , jl \u2208 [0, 1, . . . , m]. Such quantities are\ntermed multiple stochastic integrals. The main problem\n\nIf one takes into account that the order of strong convergence for the scheme (A.12) is only \u03b3 = 0.5, in contrast\nto \u03b3 = 1 for its deterministic counterpart, then it easy\nto understand why SDEs are not yet a standard tool in\nphysical applications.\nIn\norder\nto\nimprove\nthis\nsituation,\nMilstein & Tret\u00fdakov (1997) note that in many problems\nthe random fluctuations that affect a physical system are\nsmall. This means that the system (A.2) can be written\nas\ndx = a(t, x)dt + \u01eb\u03a3(t, x)dw,\n(A.13)\nwhere \u01eb is a small positive parameter. This is an important observation since, for small noise, it is possible to\nconstruct special numerical methods that are more effective and easier to implement than in the general case.\nIn fact, the term of the expansion depends not only on\nthe time step h but also on the parameter \u01eb. Typically,\nthe mean-square global error of the schemes proposed by\nMilstein & Tret\u00fdakov (1997) is of order O(hp +\u01ebk hq ) with\n0 < q < p. Although the strong order of these methods is\ngiven by q, typically not a large number, they are able to\nreach high exactness because of the factor \u01ebk at hq . For\nexample, the simple scheme\n1\nx[k+1] = x[k] + (K 1 + 2K 2 + 2K 3 + K 4 ) + \u01eb\u03a3\u2206w [k]\n6\n(A.14)\nwhere\nK 1 = ha(t[k] , x[k] ),\nK 2 = ha(t[k] + h/2, x[k] + K 1 /2),\n\n(A.15)\n(A.16)\n\nK 3 = ha(t[k] + h/2, x[k] + K 2 /2),\nK 4 = ha(t[k+1] , x[k] + K 3 ),\n\n(A.17)\n(A.18)\n\n1\nWe shall say that a discrete time approximation x[k] converges strongly with order \u03b3 > 0 at time T if there exists a\npositive constant C, which does not depend on \u03b4, and a \u03b40 > 0\nsuch that \u01eb(\u03b4) = E(|xT \u2212 x[T ] |) \u2264 C\u03b4 \u03b3 for each \u03b4 \u2208 (0, \u03b40 ).\n\n\f6\n\nR. Vio et al.: Stochastic modelling of QPOs\n\nis of order O(h4 + \u01ebh + \u01eb2 h1/2 ). In other words, the order\nof strong convergence is 0.5, as for the Euler scheme, but\nbetter results are to be expected because of the term \u01eb2\nthat multiplies h1/2 .\nAcknowledgements.
