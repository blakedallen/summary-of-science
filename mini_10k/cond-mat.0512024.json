Recent work has highlighted\nso-called non-equilibrium work-energy relations and Fluctuation Theorems which take on an equilibrium-like (time independent) form. Here\nI give a very simple heuristic example where an equilibrium result (the\nbarometric law for colloidal particles) arises from theory describing the\nthermodynamically non-equilibrium phenomenon of a single colloidal particle falling through solution due to gravity. This simple result arises\nfrom the fact that the particle, even while falling, is in mechanical equilibrium (gravitational force equal the viscous drag force) at every instant.\nThe results are generalized by appeal to the central limit theorem. The\nresulting time independent equations that hold for thermodynamically\nnon-equilibrium (and even non-stationary) processes offer great possibilities for rapid determination of thermodynamic parameters from single\nmolecule experiments.\n\nKeywords: Jarzynski equality; fluctuation theorem; brownian motors;\nThe equilibrium distribution for colloidal particles in dilute aqueous suspension\nfollows a familiar barometric or exponential law [1, 2]\nc(h) = c(0) exp (\n\n\u2212m g h\n)\nkB T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c(h) is the concentration of particles at height h. For spherical particles of\nradius r the effective mass is m = 4\u03c0r3 (\u03c1p \u2212\u03c1w )/3 where \u03c1p and \u03c1w are the mass\ndensities of the particle and of water, respectively. Eq. (1) is an equilibrium\nresult that implicitly involves many particles so that the concentrations (particle\ndensities) are well defined.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nWe can look at the situation of colloids from the very different perspective\nof a single particle falling through solution. The forces acting are gravity, mg,\nviscous drag \u03b3v \u223c \u03b7rv (where \u03b7 \u2248 10\u22123 kg/(m s) is the viscosity of water), and\na random thermal noise force the origin of which is the molecular movement\nof the water molecules. If we wait sufficiently long (about m/\u03b3 = 10\u22126 s for\na micron sized particle) the particle will reach terminal velocity vterm = mg/\u03b3\nwhere the force of gravity is balanced by the viscous drag and there is no further\nacceleration. Then, taking as the origin of the coordinate system the center of\nmass of the particle at some time t = 0 after terminal velocity is attained, the\nsubsequent probability density function P (h, t) for the particle position can be\nwritten\n2\n\n]\nexp [ \u2212(h\u2212(mg/\u03b3)t)\n\u221a 4Dt\nP (h, t) =\n4\u03c0Dt\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is a solution of Fick's equation for diffusion with drift [3]\n\u2202P (h, t)\n\u2202 2 P (h, t) mg \u2202P (h, t)\n+\n=D\n\u2202t\n\u2202h2\n\u03b3\n\u2202h\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient. Eq. 2 describes a Gaussian distribution\nwith mean \u03bc = (mg/\u03b3)t and variance \u03c3 2 = hh(t)2 i \u2212 hh(t)i2 = 2Dt. Although\nit is more likely of course that the particle moves downward, at short times,\nthere is a reasonable chance that thermal noise will cause the particle to be\nfound slightly higher than where it started at t = 0. Since the distance from\nthe center of the Gaussian to the original h = 0 is [(mg/\u03b3)t], the probability\n2\nfor a particle to be above its starting point at time t is 12 erfc [ ((mg/\u03b3)t)\n] where\n4Dt\nerfc (x) is the complement of the error function.\nThese \"upward\" trajectories have been termed \"violations of the second law\nof thermodynamics on short time and small length scales\" [4] because the entropy change is negative for trajectories where colloidal particles move up. The\nupward trajectories certainly do NOT demonstrate a violation of the more relevant Thomson (Lord Kelvin) formulation of the second law which states that no\nrepeatable (cyclic) process can do work on the environment with the sole change\nbeing a decrease in the temperature of the system. The upward trajectories can\nhowever be exploited in a non-isotropic system to allow the random input of\nenergy to drive directed motion by a Brownian motor mechanism [5].\nWe can calculate exactly the ratio of the probability density for the particle\nto \"fall up\" to +h to the probability density to fall down to \u2212h from Eq. 2 to\nbe\n\u2212mgh\nP (h, t)\n= exp (\n)\nP (\u2212h, t)\n\u03b3D\n\n(4)\n\nRemarkably, time has disappeared altogether in this ratio, and by inserting\nEinstein's relation [6] \u03b3D = kB T we regain the \"equilibrium\" barometric law\nEg. 1! An analogous relation for motion of an overdamped particle in an\n\n\f3\n\narbitrary potential was derived in a more general context by Bier et al. [7]\nusing Onsager's [8] thermodynamic action approach.\nSince the probability density function is normalized\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nP (h)dh =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nP (\u2212h)dh = 1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwe also have\nmgh\n)i =\nhexp (\nkB T\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nexp(\n\nmgh\n)P (h)dh = 1\nkB T\n\n(5)\n\nThe quantity Wdiss = \u2212mgh is the work dissipated when a particle falls a\ndistance h.\nMany stochastic processes obey a Gaussian distribution due to the central\nlimit theorem [9] which states that the probability density function for any\nvariable that can be expressed as the sum of many small random quantities approaches a Gaussian distribution irrespective of the microscopic laws governing\nthe individual small quantities so long as the mean and variance of the small\nquantities are finite. Consequently we expect equilibrium-like (time independent) relations to hold for a wide range of processes.\nConsider an arbitrary macroscopic variable q, often termed a generalized\ndisplacement, and the time derivative of its average q\u0307 which is often called\na generalized velocity or flux. If q fluctuates due to molecular noise in the\nenvironment the distribution for q will be given by\n2\n\nq\u0307t)\n]\nexp [ \u2212(q\u2212\n\u221a 4Dt\nP (q, t) =\n4\u03c0Dt\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the variance \u03c3 2 = hq(t)2 i\u2212 hq(t)i2 = 2Dt and we take q(0) = 0. As before\nP (q, t) = P (\u2212q, t) exp [q q\u0307/D] and\nhexp [q q\u0307/D]i = 1.\n\n(7)\n\nFurther, if the generalized velocity q\u0307 is related linearly to a generalized force X\nsuch that q\u0307 = X/\u03b3 (as is the case after terminal velocity is reached) we have\nP (q, t) = P (\u2212q, t) exp [qX/(\u03b3D)]. Finally, with identification of \u03b3D = kB T (a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation) we have\nP (q)\n= exp [(Wdiss /(kB T )]\nP (\u2212q)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere as before the dissipated work Wdiss is the product of the generalized force\nand displacement \u2212qX. Using the thermodynamic relation that the dissipated\nwork is the difference between the total work and the stored free energy Wdiss =\nW \u2212 \u2206G we have the equality\nhexp (W/(kB T ))i = exp(\u2206G/kB T )\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\n\nRelations analogous to equations (8) and (9) (termed non-equilibrium fluctuationdissipation theorems (FDT)) derived from a different perspective were published\ntwenty five years ago by Bochkov and Kozovlev [10].\nInterest in the non-equilibrium FDT has recently been rekindled by the\ntheoretical work of Jarzynski [11], Bier et al. [7], Crooks [12], and others.\nThis work has made important progress by relating experimental observables\nfrom non-equilibrium experiments to thermodynamic parameters such as free\nenergy. Hummer and Szabo [13] pointed out that the relations are implicit\nin the Feynman-Kac path integral theorem, and demonstrated how the nonequilibrium work energy relations and fluctuation theorems can be used to interpret single molecule experiments. The relations (8) and (9) have been experimentally tested by Bustamante and colleagues [14, 15, 16] who showed that a\nrelatively small number of single molecule experiments can be used to obtain\nvery good estimates of the Equilibrium Free Energy profiles for the system.\nIt is often stated that many single molecule experiments are carried out far\nfrom equilibrium. Indeed, the 10-100 nN force typical for an AFM pulling experiment is enormous compared to the, say, 10-20 pN force associated with even\nstrong molecular motors [17] and the rate of change of the force - up to several\nhundred nN per second - seems very large. However, when we compare the rate\nof change of the force (dF/dt \u223c 100 nN/s) with the ratio of the characteristic force [18] Fchar = \u03b7 2 /\u03c1 \u223c 10\u22129 N to the characteristic relaxation time for a\nnanometer object in solution tchar = \u03c1 r2 /\u03b7 \u221d m/\u03b3 \u223c 10\u221212 s (Fchar /tchar \u223c 103\nN/s) we see that the system is in fact very close to mechanical equilibrium at\nevery instant in time. The characteristic quantities are written in terms of the\nparticle size r \u223c 10\u22129 m, density \u03c1 \u223c 103 kg/m3 , and the viscosity of the solution \u03b7 \u223c 10\u22123 kg/(ms). Nevertheless, the system is far from thermodynamic\nequilibrium as it continues to move, and to dissipate energy in the environment.\nIn nanoscale physics, it is essential to remember that \"equilibrium\" does\nnot have a single unambiguous meaning. The thermodynamic non-equilibrium\naspect of a typical experimental system shows up as a mean energy dissipation rate that is not zero. The mechanical equilibrium aspect shows up in the\nGaussian distribution of fluctuations about the mean dissipated work (or mean\nextension) over many realizations. The MECHANICAL equilibrium allows a\nsimple description of the distribution of the fluctuations of quantities about\ntheir mean values in THERMODYNAMICALLY far from equilibrium situations. The closeness to mechanical equilibrium is ultimately the explanation\nfor the unreasonable effectiveness of equilibrium theory for interpreting experiments which, from our perspective (but not from that of the single molecule!)\nappear to be \"far from equilibrium\".\nTime independent equations that hold for non-equilibrium (and even nonstationary) processes offer great possibilities for rapid determination of thermodynamic parameters from single molecule experiments. The present paper is\nintended to provide a simple background for understanding these equilibriumlike relations, and shine light on their historical origins to facilitate further\ninvestigation.\nAcknowledgements I am very grateful to Peter Hanggi for pointing out the pa-\n\n\f5\n\nper of Bochkov and Kuzovlev, and for enlightening discussions on the origins\nof generalized fluctuation relations; I am grateful to many colleagues, including\nChris Jarzynski, Jim McClymer,Jan Liphardt, Peter von Hippel, Neil Comins,\nJohn Schellman, Howard Berg, Dudley Herschbach, John Ross, Bob Adair,\nHans Frauenfelder, Michel Peyrard, Bob Mazo, Ioan Kosztin, Steve Block, Joe\nHoward, Ken Dill, and Hans von Baeyer, for reading and commenting on the\nmanuscript.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
