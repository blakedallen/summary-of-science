Each walk visits a sequence\nof first-neighbor lattice sites and may be viewed as a chain of monomers located on the lattice\nsites linked by bonds on the lattice edges. This model was already considered by Flory in\nhis pioneering work on polymers [1], and later De Gennes discovered a mapping between\nthis model and the n-vector model of magnetism in the formal limit n \u2192 0, which allowed\nhim to apply the renormalization group formalism to this problem [2]. The ideas of scaling\nand universality are very important in this field [3].\nIf the polymer is placed in a poor solvent, the interactions between the molecules\n(monomer-monomer, monomer-solvent, and solvent-solvent) penalize energetically the\nmonomer-solvent contacts. In a lattice model, this may be studied considering an effective attractive interactions between monomers located on first-neighbor sites of the lattice\nwhich are not consecutive along a chain. These interactions compete with the repulsive excluded volume interactions (which lead to the self-avoidance constraint), and at sufficiently\nlow temperatures the chain may undergo a collapse transition, from an extended to a more\ncompact configuration. For example, the exponent \u03bd which describes the behavior of the\nmean square end-to-end distance of the chain as a function of the molecular weight (number\nof monomers) M, hR2 i \u2248 M 2\u03bd , changes from a larger value in the extended configuration to\n1/d, where d is the dimensionality of the lattice, in the collapsed state. The temperature at\nwhich this transition happens is called the \u03b8-temperature [1]. It turns out to be particularly\ninteresting to consider this model of self-attracting self-avoiding walks (SASAW's) in the\ngrand-canonical ensemble [3], since the polymerization transition in the chemical potential\n\u00d7 temperature phase diagram is found to change from continuous, at high temperatures\nto discontinuous below the \u03b8-temperature. This is consistent with the description of the\nbehavior of the exponent \u03bd above, since at the transition the density of monomers vanishes\nfor T > T\u03b8 and is finite for T < T\u03b8 . Thus, the \u03b8-point may be recognized as a tricritical\npoint. Much is known about this tricritical point in two dimensions [5] and its exact tricritical exponents were found through the study of a diluted polymerization model [6]. On the\nsquare lattice, for a model where the attractive interactions are between bonds of the chain\non opposite edges of elementary squares, there are indications that an even richer phase\ndiagram is found, with an additional dense polymerized phase [7, 8].\n3\n\n\fSome time ago, a model was introduced to study interacting polymers where only onesite interactions are present [9], in opposition to the usual SASAW's model, where we have\ninteractions between monomers at first-neighbor sites. Usually lattice models for fluids may\nbe viewed as a consequence of the partition of space into small cells (cellular model), of\nmolecular size. In the SASAW's model, such a cell may be occupied by a single monomer\nor empty. Now if the cells are larger, they may be occupied by more than one monomer (we\nwill call this the multiple monomers per site (MMS) model) , and the interactions may be\nsupposed to occur only between monomers in the same cell. If the bonds are larger than the\nsize of the cells, two monomers in the same cell may not be connected by a bond. Thus, in\nthe new model each lattice site may be either empty or occupied by 1, 2, . . . , K monomers,\nand an attractive interaction exists between each pair of monomers on the same site. This\nmodel may be viewed as a generalization of the Domb-Joyce model, where also multiple\nmonomers may be placed on the same lattice site [10]. In [9] two versions of the model were\nstudied using canonical simulations: in the RA (immediate reversals allowed) model there\nare no additional restrictions on the walks, but in the RF (immediate reversals forbidden)\nmodel configurations where the walk leaves one site, reaches a first neighbor and returns to\nthe original site are not allowed. The simulation lead to particularly interesting results for\nthe RF model on the cubic lattice, with two distinct collapse transitions present in the phase\ndiagram. The precise nature of these transitions, as well as the nature of the multicritical\npoint where the two transition lines meet, could not be found, although one of the collapse\ntransitions seems to be discontinuous.\nRecently, the RF and RA models in the grand-canonical ensemble were solved on the\nBethe lattice [11] for the case K = 2. The parameter space for this model is defined by\nthe statistical weights \u03c9i , i = 1, 2, of sites occupied by i monomers (the weight of empty\nsites is equal to one). In the solution of the RF model the continuous polymerization\ntransition at high temperatures ended at a tricritical point, similar to what is observed for\nthe SASAW's model. An additional polymerized phase (DO) appears at higher values of the\nstatistical weight of double occupied sites \u03c92 , where only empty and double-occupied sites\nare present. Later, the RF model, still for K = 2, was solved on the Husimi lattice [12].\nIt is expected that this solution should be closer to the thermodynamic behavior observed\non regular lattices. The phase diagram found is similar to the one obtained in the Bethe\nlattice solution, although the region of stability of the DO phase is smaller. It is also worth\n4\n\n\fto mention that a rather unphysical result found on the Bethe lattice, where the tricritical\ncollapse transition point is found for vanishing interactions between monomers, is corrected\nin the Husimi lattice, where this point is located in the region of attractive interactions, as\nexpected.\nIn this paper we solve the model for K = 3 on the Bethe lattice. This generalization of the\nprevious work allows us to compare our results with the simulations described by Krawczyk et\nal [9]. Actually, the correspondence between the canonical ensemble, in which the simulations\nwere done, and the grand-canonical ensemble used in this paper is not straightforward for the\npolymer models, and we will discuss this matter in detail below. Basically, to compare the\ngrand-canonical results to the behavior of the model in the canonical situation, we consider\nthat when the polymers are placed in an excess of solvent (dilute situation), we actually\nhave them coexisting with the pure solvent phase, which corresponds to the non-polymerized\nphase, stable in the grand-canonical solution for low values of the monomer activity. The\ndensity of the coexisting polymer phase may vanish, and therefore we have a critical situation\nassociated to extended polymers, or may be finite, corresponding to collapsed polymers.\nIn the present calculations, we considered the monomers located on the same site to be\nindistinguishable, as was done in the previous work [12], and in opposition to the calculations\ndone in [11], where the distinguishable case was treated. One of the reasons to do so is that\nthe simulations presented in [9] were also performed for the indistinguishable case. Another\nadditional point which we address is the location of coexistence surfaces in the phase diagram\nof models solved on hierarchical lattices such as the Bethe lattice. In the previous calculations\nof the MMS model on treelike lattices, the recursion relations were used directly to find the\ncoexistence loci iterating them with initial conditions defined by the parameters of the model,\na procedure proposed in [8]. Although this procedure has considerable physical appeal, it is\nnot granted that the results furnished by it will be consistent with the ones provided by freeenergy calculations. Actually, in more complex models the 'natural' initial conditions (NIC)\nmay not be unique and there is the possibility that different locations for the coexistence\nsurface are obtained for different reasonable choices of these conditions. Therefore, in the\npresent calculations we decided to adopt a definition for the bulk free energy per site which\nwas proposed some time ago by Gujrati [13] and has lead to the same results as other methods\nbased on more solid foundations, such as the integration over the order parameter, in models\nwhere it is possible to perform these calculations. We found that in the present model the\n5\n\n\frevision of the procedure to find the coexistence surfaces actually lead to qualitative changes\nin the phase diagram, thus showing that the NIC method adopted before may actually lead\nto results which are not close to the ones provided by more reliable calculations.\nIn section II the model is defined in more detail and its solution on the Bethe lattice is\nobtained. The thermodynamic behavior of the model is presented in section III. In section\nIV, we discuss the relation between the grand-canonical and the canonical behavior of the\nmodel, comparing the results of the present calculation with the finding of the simulations\nperformed by Krawczyk et al [9]. Final discussions may be found in section V. Some\nmore results and discussions concerning the location of coexistence surfaces on Bethe lattice\nsolutions have been placed in the appendix A, and the determination of the multicritical\npoint in the parameter space may be found in the appendix B.\n\nII.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE MODEL AND SOLUTION IN TERMS OF RECUR-\n\nSION RELATIONS\n\nWe consider self- and mutually avoiding walks on a Cayley tree with arbitrary coordination number q, imposing the constraint which forbids immediate reversals. The endpoints\nof the walks are placed on the surface of the tree. The grand-canonical partition function of\nthe model will be given by:\nY =\n\nX\n\n\u03c91N1 \u03c92N2 \u03c93N3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the sum is over the configurations of the walks on the tree, while Ni , i = 1, 2, 3 is\nthe number of sites visited i times by the walks or, in other words, the number of sites with\ni monomers in the configuration. Thus, \u03c9i , i = 1, 2, 3 are the statistical weights of a site\nvisited i times or, in other words, with i monomers placed on them. In Fig. 1 a contribution\nto the partition function is shown.\nAs usual, to solve the model on the Bethe lattice we start considering rooted subtrees of\nthe Cayley tree, defining partial partition functions for them, where we sum over all possible\nconfigurations for a fixed configuration of the root of the subtree. We thus define four partial\npartition functions gi , i = 0, 1, 2, 3, where i corresponds to the number of polymer bonds\nplaced on the root edge of the subtree. The subtrees are shown in Fig. 2.\nActually, it is important to discuss a point about these choice for the partial partition\nfunctions. For the ones with multiple bonds at the root edge (g2 and g3 ) a distinction\n6\n\n\fFIG. 1: (Color online) A contribution to the partition function of the model on a Cayley tree with\nq = 4 and 3 generations. The weight of this contribution will be \u03c916 \u03c923 \u03c934 .\n\nFIG. 2: Illustration of the rooted subtrees which correspond to the partial partition functions.\n\nshould be made between the situations where two or more bonds are distinguishable or not,\nsince this distinction is important when we will define the combinatorial coefficients in the\nrecursion relations below. A pair of bonds which are indistinguishable corresponds to the\nsituation where both chains visit the same sequence of sites since the surface of the tree.\nTherefore, g2 should be split into two different partial partition functions and three cases\nshould be considered for g3 . Thus, the total number of partial partition functions would be\nequal to seven. However, we found out that it is sufficient to consider only the case where\nall bonds are distinguishable, since the ratios of gi /g0 where gi is a partial partition function\nof a configuration with indistinguishable bonds all vanish at the relevant fixed points of the\nrecursion relations defined below, which corresponds to the thermodynamic behavior of the\nmodel. Actually, there are two fixed points where the density of edges with one polymer bond\non them vanishes, and for the phases associated to these fixed points (the DO and TO fixed\npoints described below) the inclusion of indistinguishable polymer bonds in the recursion\n\n7\n\n\frelations leads to different results, since their density does not vanish in the thermodynamic\nlimit. However, we found that these phases will never be the one with lowest free energy in\nany point of the parameter space, and thus if we do not include indistinguishable bonds in\nour discussion this will not imply any change in the phase diagram. Therefore, we decided,\nfor simplicity, to restrict the discussion of the model to the case of distinguishable bonds only.\nIn other words, in the limit of an infinite tree, chains with indistinguishable bonds will never\nreach the central region of the tree if the density of edges with single polymer bonds does\nnot vanish in this region. This may be understood if we notice that in the recursion relations\nfor partial partition functions with indistinguishable bonds there are always configurations\nconnecting them to other configurations without those bonds, provided single bonds are\nincident at the same site, but never the opposite happens, so it is not surprising that these\ncontributions vanish at the fixed points. We will discuss this point in some more detail below,\nwhen the recursion relations for the partial partition functions will be obtained. Also, we\nnotice that if we would adopt that the surface sites of the tree should not be occupied by\ntwo monomers, we never would have indistinguishable bonds at any stage of the iteration,\nbut in treelike structures like the Bethe lattice it is not granted that such a constraint will\nnot influence the phase diagram of the model.\nWe then proceed obtaining recursion relations for the partial partition functions, by\nconsidering the operation of attaching q \u2212 1 subtrees with a certain number of generations\nto a new root site and edge, thus building a subtree with an additional generation. Below\nP \u2032\nthe recursion relations are presented. In general, we have gi\u2032 = j gi,j\n, where the primes\n\ndenote the partial partition function on the subtree with one more generation. Whenever\n\nappropriate, the contributions to the sums begin with a product of two numerical factors, the\nfirst of which is the multiplicity of the configuration of the incoming bonds and the second is\nthe multiplicity of the connections with the monomers located at the new site. As discussed\nin the introduction, we consider the monomers to be indistinguishable, in opposition to what\nwe did in the particular case K = 2 of the RF model we have studied before [11]. Actually, in\nthe recursion relations below, to obtain the results for the case of distinguishable monomers\none simply has to replace \u03c92 by 2\u03c92 and \u03c93 by 6\u03c93 .

In this contribution, a\nedge with two bonds and another with a single bond reach the root site from above, and\na single polymer bond proceeds to the root edge. Therefore, one of the polymer bonds\nof the double bonded edges is connected to the bond at the root, while the other one is\nlinked to the other bond coming from above. If the bonds in the double bonded incoming\nedge are distinguishable, there are two distinct linking configurations, thus leading to the\nsecond factor 2 in the recursion relation. If the polymer bonds on the same edge were\nindistinguishable, this factor would be unitary, and it is worth noting that this contribution\nwould end a chain of double bonds which has started at the surface of the tree, splitting it\ninto two edges with single bonds.\n\n10\n\n\fFor g2\u2032 we find the contributions:\n\u2032\ng2,1\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 1 \u03c92 g0q\u22123 g12 ,\n=\n2\n\n\u2032\ng2,2\n= (q \u2212 1) \u00d7 1 \u03c92 g0q\u22122 g2 ,\n\n(4a)\n\n(4b)\n\n\u2032\ng2,3\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 6 \u03c93 g0q\u22125 g14,\n=\n4\n\n(4c)\n\n\u2032\ng2,4\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 5 \u03c93 g0q\u22124 g12 g2 ,\n= 3\n3\n\n(4d)\n\n\u2032\ng2,5\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 4 \u03c93 g0q\u22123 g22,\n=\n2\n\n(4e)\n\n\u2032\ng2,6\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 3 \u03c93 g0q\u22123 g1 g3 .\n= 2\n2\n\n(4f)\n\nFinally, the contributions to the recursion relations for g3\u2032 are\n\n\u2032\ng3,1\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 1 \u03c93 g0q\u22124 g13 ,\n=\n3\n\n(5a)\n\n\u2032\ng3,2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u00d7 1 \u03c93 g0q\u22123 g1 g2 ,\n= 2\n2\n\n(5b)\n\n\u2032\ng3,3\n= (q \u2212 1) \u00d7 1 \u03c93 g0q\u22122 g3 .\n\n(5c)\n\nThe partial partition functions often grow exponentially with the number of iterations ,\nso that we may now define ratios of the partial partition functions R1 = g1 /g0 , R2 = g2 /g0 .\nand R3 = g3 /g0 , and write the recursion relations for these ratios, which usually remain\n\n11\n\n\ffinite in the thermodynamic limit.

We find five different fixed points, which are\ndescribed below:\n1. Non-polymerized (NP) fixed point:\nThis fixed point is characterized by R1N P = R2N P = R3N P = 0, and therefore all\ndensities vanish. In order to study the stability region in the parameter space for this\nfixed point, we consider the Jacobian:\n\uf8eb\nJi,j =\n\n\u2202Ri\u2032\n\u2202Rj\n\nR1 =R2 =R3 =0\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(q \u2212 1) \u03c91\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(q \u2212 1) \u03c92\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(q \u2212 1) \u03c93\n\n13\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(12)\n\n\fand the region of the parameter space for which the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian\nis smaller than one and therefore the NP phase is stable, is the one for which the\nthree inequalities below are simultaneously satisfied:\n\u03c91 <\n\n1\n;\nq\u22121\n\n\u03c92 <\n\n1\n1\n; and \u03c93 <\n.\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\n\n(13)\n\n2. Double occupancy (DO) fixed point:\nIn this fixed point the ratios are given by R1 = R3 = 0 and R2 = R2DO 6= 0. The fixed\npoint value of R2 will be one of the solutions of the cubic equation:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nDO 2\nDO 3\n\u03c93 R2DO \u2212 (q \u22121) \u03c92 + 1 = 0.\n\u03c92 [R2 ] \u2212 4\n\u03c93 [R2 ] + 2\n8\n2\n2\n3\n(14)\nFor q = 3 the cubic term of the equation vanishes and a simple expression is found for\nthe fixed point value of R2 :\n(DO)\nR2;q=3\n\n=\n\n2 \u03c93 \u00b1\n\np\n(4 \u03c93 )2 + 2 (2 \u03c92 \u2212 1)\u03c92\n.\n2 \u03c92\n\n(15)\n\nIt is worth noticing that this fixed point does not disappear when \u03c92 = 0, \u03c93 6= 0.\nActually, in general it corresponds to a double occupancy of bonds and not necessarily\nof sites. Also, it is easy to obtain the elements of the Jacobian at this fixed point, as\na function of the statistical weights and R2DO .\n3. Triple occupancy (TO) fixed point:\nAt this fixed point, we have R1 = R2 = 0 ; R3 = R3T O 6= 0, and the fixed point value\nof the ratio R3 is given by:\nR3T O =\n\ns\n\n(q \u2212 1) \u03c93 \u2212 1\n,\n3(q \u2212 1)(q \u2212 2) \u03c93\n\nThe Jacobian for this fixed point will be\n\uf8eb\n\u03c91\n\u03c93\n\n(T O)\nJi,j\n\n\u2202Ri\u2032\n=\n\u2202Rj\n\nTO\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec q\n\uf8ec\n12(q\u22122) [(q\u22121) \u03c93 \u22121]\n= \uf8ec\n(q\u22121) \u03c93\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n14\n\nq\n\n3 (q\u22122) [(q\u22121) \u03c93 \u22121]\n(q\u22121) \u03c93\n\n\u03c92\n\u03c93\n\n0\n\n(16)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\n0\n2\n(q\u22121) \u03c93\n\n\u22121\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 . (17)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\fWe found two additional fixed points which display all ratios different from zero. There\nexists a region in the parameter space where both are stable, thus a coexistence surface\nof both regular polymerized phases is found, as will be seen below. The two phases\nare:\n4. Regular polymerized (P1) fixed point:\nThis phase is stable in a region situated at \u03c91 >\n\n1\nq\u22121\n\nand for small values of \u03c93\n\n5. Regular polymerized (P2) fixed point:\nThis fixed point is stable for sufficiently large values of \u03c93 . At the coexistence surface\nof both regular polymerized phases, P1 is more anisotropic than P2, in the sense that\nin the former R1 , R2 \u226b R3 and \u03c11 \u226b \u03c12 , \u03c13 , while in phase P2 ratios and densities are\nmore balanced.\nIn some fixed points (mainly in the last two), we were unable to perform an analytic study\nof the Jacobian as a function of the statistical weights, but it is easy to obtain numerically\nthe matrix elements as functions of these weights and the fixed point values of the ratios. In\nthis way, we obtained the stability limits (spinodals) of the five fixed points (or phases), in\norder, to characterize the transitions between them. As we are dealing with three parameters,\nthe spinodals are surfaces in the parameter space (\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 ). The continuous transitions\n(surfaces, lines or points) happen in the regions where the spinodals of the different phases\nare coincident. The coexistence surfaces are bounded by the spinodals, but for their precise\nlocation in the parameter space it is necessary to obtain the bulk free energy of the Bethe\nlattice solution.\n\nB.\n\nFree energy\n\nIt is useful, particularly to find the coexistence surfaces in the phase diagrams, to calculate\nthe free energies of the various thermodynamic phases of the model. One possibility would\nbe to perform the Maxwell construction, and actually this was done for similar models some\ntime ago [7], but this procedure would be awkward in the present case, particularly in regions\nof the parameter space where more than two fixed points are stable. A simple way to find the\ncoexistence region [8] is just to iterate the recursion relations starting with 'natural' initial\n15\n\n\fconditions, that is, using initial values for the ratios which correspond to a reasonable choice\nfor the configurations at the surface of the Cayley tree. Actually, we used this procedure in\nour recent works on the K = 2 case of the present model [11, 12]. Although this procedure\nhas a considerable physical appeal, is simple and leads to reasonable results, we were not\nable to justify it starting from basic principles. In particular, for more complex models, the\n'natural' initial conditions may not be unique, and different choices for them could lead to\ndifferent results for the locus of coexistence. On the other side, the Maxwell construction\nfollows directly from the recursion relations, being therefore independent from the choice of\ninitial conditions for the iterations. So we decided to use a procedure described by Gujrati\n[13] to find the free energy of the thermodynamic phases.\nWe will briefly discuss Gujrati's argument, in a version appropriate for the present model.\nWe consider the grand-canonical free energy of the model on the Cayley tree with M generations \u03a6\u0303M = kB T ln YM , where T is the absolute temperature and kB stands for Boltzmann's\nconstant. We may then define a reduced adimensional free energy \u03a6M = \u03a6\u0303M /kB T . It is\nusual in finite size scaling arguments to consider the free energy per site on regular lattices\nto be different for sites on the surface and in the bulk of the lattice. Here we will make a\nsimilar ansatz, and suppose the reduced free energy per site to be the same for all sites of\nthe same generation of the Cayley tree. Let us number the generations starting at 0 for the\nsurface of the tree, and define \u03c60 as the reduced free energy per site for the q(q \u2212 1)M \u22121\nsites on the surface of the M-generations tree, \u03c61 will be the free energy per site for the\nq(q \u2212 1)M \u22122 sites the first generation and so on. We may then write the total free energy of\nthe Cayley tree as:\n\u03a6M = q(q \u2212 1)M \u22121 \u03c60 + q(q \u2212 1)M \u22122 \u03c61 + ... + q\u03c6M \u22121 + \u03c6M ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c6M is the reduced free energy of the central site of the tree, which is the one which\nshould correspond to the Bethe lattice solution of the model. We may now write a similar\nexpression for a tree with M +1 generations, assuming a homogeneity condition which states\nthe free energy per site for sites of the same generation of the two trees to be the same, so\nthat:\n\u03a6M +1 = q(q \u2212 1)M \u03c60 + q(q \u2212 1)M \u22121 \u03c61 + ... + q\u03c6M + \u03c6M +1 ,\n\n(19)\n\nBy inspection, we may readily realize that \u03a6M +1 \u2212 (q \u2212 1)\u03a6M = \u03c6M + \u03c6M +1 . If we now\n16\n\n\fconsider that in the thermodynamic limit M \u2192 \u221e the free energies of the central sites of\nboth trees should be the same, that is \u03c6M +1 = \u03c6M = \u03c6b , where \u03c6b is the bulk free energy\nper site which corresponds to the Bethe lattice solution, we have \u03a6M +1 \u2212 (q \u2212 1)\u03a6M = 2\u03c6b ,\nso that the reduced free energy per site for the Bethe lattice is:\n!\n1\nYM +1\n\u03c6b = \u2212 lim ln\n.\n(q\u22121)\n2 M \u2192\u221e\nYM\n\n(20)\n\nThis result is equivalent to the expression (3) in reference [13], although here we are considering a less general situation than the original work.\nEvaluating the ratio of partition functions in the expression above for the reduced bulk\nfree energy at the fixed point, we find that:\nlim\n\nYM +1\n\nM \u2192\u221e\n\n(q\u22121)\n\nYM\n\n=\n\nDq\n(1 + P + Q + S)q\u22122\n\n(21)\n\nand therefore we have:\n1\n\u03c6b = \u2212 [q ln D \u2212 (q \u2212 2) ln y]\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere y = 1 + P + Q + S and D are calculated at the fixed point M \u2192 \u221e.\nC.\n\nPhase diagrams\n\nUsing the spinodals to find the continuous transitions and the free energy to determine\nthe coexistence surfaces we are able to build the whole phase diagram of the system. We\nwill show some cuts of the phase diagram for q = 4, as well as a perspective of the whole\ndiagram in the three-dimensional parameter space.\nThe diagram for \u03c93 = 0 (K = 2) is shown in Fig. 3. For small values of \u03c92 we find\na continuous transition, between the phases NP and P2, which ends at a tricritical point\n(TCP) located at \u03c91T CP =\n\n1\n(q\u22121)\n\nand \u03c92T CP =\n\n1\n,\n(q\u22121)2\n\nas found in [11]. Above the tricritical\n\npoint the transition becomes discontinuous. Here it is important to stress that this particular\ncase (\u03c93 = 0) was studied in [11], considering distinguishable monomers and using the NIC\nmethod to find the coexistence lines. There three \"stable\" phases were found: NP, P and DO,\nhowever, here (using the free energies) we find only two stable phases: NP and P2. Indeed,\nthe DO fixed point is stable in a region of the parameter space, but the corresponding phase\nis never the one with the lowest free energy, that is, its free energy is always greater than\n17\n\n\f0,3\n\nP2\n\n\u03c92\n\n0,2\n\n0,0\n0\n\nTCP\n\nNP\n\n0,1\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n\u03c91\n\n0,4\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Phase diagram for \u03c93 = 0.

In the same way, the TO phase is never the most stable in any\nregion of the phase diagram, although, if we use the NIC method it appears to be stable for\nsmall values of \u03c91 and \u03c92 and large \u03c93 . A detailed discussion of this point may be found the\nappendix A.\nIn the \u03c92 = 0 plane, we found a very rich phase diagram, as is shown in Fig. 4 For\n\u03c91 <\n\n1\n(q\u22121)\n\nwe find a first order transition between the phases NP and P2.

Also, to illustrate the discussion of the\ndifferences in both regular polymerized phases, we show in Fig. 6 the fixed point values of\nthe densities as functions of \u03c93 for \u03c91 = 0.4 and \u03c92 = 0.02 (dashed line in phase diagram c)\nin Fig. 5).\nA sketch of the whole three-dimensional phase diagram is shown in Fig. 7 and this\nsummarizes all the features discussed in the two-dimensional cuts of the phase diagram\npresented above.\n\nIV.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH THE CANONICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nThe K = 3 version of the model were originally studied by Krawczyk et al. [9] using\nMonte Carlo simulations. The simulations were performed considering a chain of constant\nsize placed on an infinite lattice, so that they are in the canonical ensemble. To compare\nour grand-canonical results with the simulations we have to map our phase diagram to the\ncanonical one.

The first order transition\nsurfaces: NP-P2 (red) and P1-P2 (violet), limited by dashed lines, are shown.\n\nlattice sites). Therefore, we may say that in the simulations the polymer coexists with the\nempty lattice, namely, we have two phases coexisting: one of them polymerized (the polymer\nitself and the empty lattice sites close to it) and a non-polymerized (the remaining empty\nlattice sites). It follows that in our grand-canonical calculations the canonical situation of\nthe simulations corresponds to the critical and coexistence surfaces limiting the NP phase,\nand the critical lines and points at these surfaces must be the critical lines in the canonical\ndiagram.\n21\n\n\fIn the canonical simulations, Krawczyk et al. fixed the energy of a single monomer to\nbe equal to zero, i. e., the Boltzmann weight e\u03b20 = 1. The parameters in the simulations\nwere \u03b2l = \u2212\u03b2\u03b5l , with l = 1, 2, where \u03b2 = 1/kB T and \u03b5l is the energy associated with sites\noccupied by l + 1 monomers. To relate the simulational parameters to the ones used in our\ngrand-canonical calculations, we notice that in our calculations the statistical weight of a\nsite occupied by a single monomer is \u03c91 = z, where z is the activity of a monomer. A energy\n\u03b51 is associated to a site with two monomers, thus the corresponding statistical weight is\n\u03c92 = z 2 e\u2212\u03b2\u03b51 and for a site with three monomers, we have \u03c93 = z 3 e\u2212\u03b2\u03b52 . Therefore, the\nparameters used in the canonical simulations relate to the parameters used here as\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u03c92\n\u03b21 = ln 2 ,\n\u03c9\n\u0014 1\u0015\n\u03c93\n\u03b22 = ln 3 .\n\u03c91\n\n(23a)\n(23b)\n\n2,0\n1,5\n\nNP-P2\n(Collapsed)\n\n1,0\n\n\u03b22\n\n0,5\n0,0\n\nNP-P1\n(SAW)\n\n-0,5\n-1,0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n\u03b21\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Canonical phase diagram. The curve at \u03b22 > 0 (green) is the CEP line and\nthe straight line at \u03b22 < 0 (blue) is the tricritical line. The multicritical point, where the two lines\nmeet, is located on the origin and represented by a circle.\n\nThe canonical phase diagram which we found in the \u03b21 , \u03b22 parameters is shown in Fig. 8,\nfor a Bethe lattice with q = 4. The multicritical point is located on the origin. The tricritical\nline is placed at \u03b21 = 0 and \u03b22 ranging between \u2212\u221e and 0. The critical endpoint line is in the\nnegative \u03b21 and positive \u03b22 quadrant. For \u03b21 < 0 and below the CEP curves, we have a region\n22\n\n\fcorresponding to the critical surface NP-P1 in the grand-canonical phase diagram. Thus,\nin this region the polymers are formed by chains with predominance of single visited sites,\nthis is agreement with the simulations results. The other region corresponds to coexistence\nsurface between NP and P2 phases, thus in this region sites with two or three monomers are\nmore frequent, characterizing a \"collapsed\" phase. Indeed, a dense polymerized phase, in the\ngrand-canonical ensemble, is characterized by the lattice completely occupied by monomers\n(\u03c1 = 1), and, in our solution method, this would appear as a fixed point with one or more\ndiverging ratios Ri . In this model we do not find any collapsed phase in this sense, such a\nphase may be present in SASAW's with attractive interactions between bonds in elementary\nsquares on the square lattice [7]. Nevertheless, as the density of the polymerized phases at\nthe coexistence loci is nonzero, this already sets \u03bd = 1/d and therefore it is appropriate to\ncall this a collapsed phase.\nThe location of the multicritical point in the Bethe lattice solution (\u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0) is\nnot physically reasonable because it corresponds to non-interacting monomers. We expect\nthat the transition to the collapsed phase occurs in a attractive region for at least one of\nthe parameters (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ), but for \u03b22 < 0 the transition line is along the \u03b22 axis (\u03b21 = 0)\nand this it is not reasonable. But, it is important to keep in mind that our solution is a\nmean-field approximation, which generally overestimates the domain of the ordered phase.\nActually, this inconsistency was already noted in the solution of the case K = 2 [11], and was\none of the motivation to perform a calculation of this model on the Husimi lattice, which\nis expected to lead to results closer to the ones on regular lattices. This solution, which\ncorresponds to the particular case \u03c93 = 0 and \u03b22 = \u2212\u221e of the model considered here, on\nthe Husimi lattice build with squares (a second order approximation for the square lattice)\ndisplays a tricritical point located at \u03c91 = 0.3325510(6) and \u03c92 = 0.120544(4), which in\nthe canonical variables corresponds to \u03b21 \u2248 1.09 and \u03b22 = \u2212\u221e. Thus, within this (better)\napproximation, at least in \u03b22 = \u2212\u221e limit, we find the transition in the expected region\n(\u03b21 > 0). This suggests that the whole tricritical line may be at positive values of \u03b21 , as\nfound in the simulations, and therefore, the multicritical point may not be at the origin.\nFinally, there is the question of the order of the transitions. In the simulations, Krawczyk\net al. suggest, by estimating the fluctuations of the order parameter in their simulations, that\nfor \u03b21 < 0 the transition is continuous and for \u03b22 < 0 it becomes of first-order one, and this\nlines match at a tricritical point. In our phase diagram, all transitions are continuous but we\n23\n\n\fhave a tricritical line in \u03b22 < 0 and a CEP line in \u03b21 < 0 region. Although both transitions\nare always continuous the critical exponents should be different in the two lines, due to the\nfact that the transitions are of a different nature (critical endpoints and tricritical points).\nActually, since in the canonical conditions the tricritical line is always approached in the\nweak direction [14], that is, staying on the coexistence surface, the weak tricritical exponents\nwill be found. In particular, in three dimensions, the tricritical exponents will be classical,\napart from logarithmic corrections [15]. In particular, as in the simulations Krawczyk et al.\nhave estimated the fluctuations of order-parameter like variables, for the tricritical line the\nexpected exponent would be \u03b3 = 2. The critical endpoint line, however, is characterized\nby regular critical exponents, and estimates of \u03b3 for the polymerization transition in three\ndimensions are around 1.158 [16], while the classical value is equal to unity. The estimates\nfrom the simulations have lead Krawczyk et al. to suggest that the transition line which\ncorresponds to the tricritical line in our approximate calculations should be of first order.\nThey also remark that this transition appears to be stronger than the one which corresponds\nto our critical endpoint line. It remains an open question if the stronger singularity observed\nin the former transition could not be due to the larger exponent for the singularity in the\nfluctuations of the order parameter.\n\nV.\n\nFINAL DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION\n\nAlthough, as discussed above, there are some differences between the canonical simulational estimates and our present Bethe lattice calculations, they have many similarities. It\nis worth mentioning that in the simulations no transitions were found for the RF model on\nthe square lattice [9]. It is possible that actually the model shows a qualitatively different\nbehavior on two-dimensional lattices than the one found here, since the Bethe lattice may\nbe regarded as an infinite dimensional lattice [17].\nAnother question which is worth to be considered is the relation of the model with\nmultiple monomers per site with the problem of the collapse transition for polymers in a\npoor solvent. As mentioned above, one of the simplest models used to study these transition\nis the SASAW's model, so that it is interesting to find a relation between both models. We\nmay notice that the real situation of a polymer in a poor solvent may be discretized by\nsupposing the volume to be composed by cells of roughly the size of a monomer, so that\n24\n\n\feach cell will be either occupied by a monomer (full) or by a solvent molecule (empty).\nFor simplicity, we are assuming the solvent molecules to have roughly the same size as the\nmonomers. Now if we require the cells to form a regular lattice, we end up with a lattice\ngas model. The monomer-monomer, monomer-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions may\nthen be considered effectively by introducing an attractive interaction between monomers\nin first-neighbor sites which are not connected by a polymer bond. Now we could imagine\nlarger cells, composed by K of the original cells, so that each of them may be occupied by up\nto K monomers. If we now add the constraint that no polymer bond may be formed between\nmonomers in the same cell and that attractive interactions only between monomers in the\nsame cell will be considered we end up essentially with the MMS model. The parameters\nin the grand-canonical SASAW's models are the activity of a monomer z and the attractive\ninteraction \u2212\u01eb (\u01eb > 0) between monomers. Considering the correspondence of this model\nwith the MMS model, we notice that the total contribution of a site with i monomers to the\ninternal energy will be \u2212\u01eb i(i \u2212 1)/2, so that we may relate the parameters of both models\nas follows:\n\u03c9i = z i \u03c9 e(i) , i = 1, 2, . . . , K,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the exponent e(i) = i(i \u2212 1)/2 and \u03c9 = exp(\u2212\u01eb/kB T ). Therefore, we notice that the\nMMS model with up to K monomers per site corresponds to a grand-canonical SASAW's\nmodel with constraints in a two-dimensional subspace of its original K-dimensional parameter space. If we consider the canonical situation, the dimensionality of the parameter space\nis reduced by one in both models.\nIn the particular case of the K = 3 MMS model, we have the relations \u03c91 = z, \u03c92 = z 2 \u03c9,\nand \u03c93 = z 3 \u03c9 3 . Thus, recalling the definitions of the canonical parameters \u03b2i of the model\nEq. (23), it will correspond to the canonical SASAW's model with constraints for \u03b22 = 3\u03b21 .\nFor the Bethe lattice solution presented here, the multicritical point is located at the origin\nin the (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ) space, and this point belongs to the SASAW's subspace. However, as discussed\nabove, this unphysical localization of the multicritical point may be due to the approximate\ncharacter of the solution. In the simulations by Krawczyk et al. of the RF model on the\ncubic lattice the multicritical point is located in the first quadrant of the (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ) space (Fig.\n2 of reference [9]). Unfortunately the precision in the estimated location of the multicritical\npoint in the simulations seems not to be sufficient to determine its situation with respect to\nthe \u03b22 = 3\u03b21 line. It would be very interesting to find out if the multicritical point is located\n25\n\n\fabove the SASAW's line, in which case the collapse transition can be identified with the\npoint where the line crosses the tricritical line of the MMS model. In this case, the collapse\ntransition in the MMS model would be a tricritical point, which is consistent with the well\nestablished result for this transition.\nFinally, we notice that we have not studied the RA model here, where immediate reversals\nare allowed. In the simulations of the K = 3 case of this model on the cubic lattice, no\ntransition to the collapsed phase was found [9], suggesting that the RF constraint is essential\nto produce this transition. One possible explanation of the reason for the effect of the RF\nconstraint on the MMS model is that without this constraint contributions are possible that\nactually correspond to extended chainlike structures. Let us illustrate this by an example\nfor the K = 2 model on a square lattice. If we have \u03c92 \u226b \u03c91 , beside the DO phase, where\na pair of parallel bonds starts on the surface and crosses the lattice, if immediate reversals\nare allowed other chainlike structures, with a much higher entropy, are possible with double\noccupied sites only, as may be seen in Fig.9. Such a contribution has an exponent \u03bd which\ncorrespond to extended polymers, and if these contributions dominate in the polymerized\nphase no extended-collapsed transition will occur. Of course, this argument is speculative\nand should be verified by simulations or approximate calculations for the RA model. As a\nfinal remark, we notice that no transition was found in the simulations of the K = 3 model\non the square lattice [9]. Although mean-field like calculations such as the one presented here\nbecome less reliable as the dimension is lowered, thus making it possible that e transition\nfound in those approximations is actually absent in the two-dimensional case, it is worth\nremaining that the model of SASAW's on the square lattice is well studied and shows a\ntricritical collapse transition [5], and therefore it is interesting to further investigate the\nMMS model on two-dimensional lattices.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTJO acknowledges doctoral grants by CNPq and FAPERJ JFS acknowledges travel support of the Argentinian agencies SECYTUNC and CONICET, and thanks the Universidad\nNacional de C\u00f3rdoba for hospitality, he is also grateful to CNPq for partial financial support.\nPS acknowledges SECYT-UNC, CONICET and FONCyT for partial financial support.\n\n26\n\n\fFIG. 9: (Color online) Contribution for the K = 2 RA model on a square lattice, with a chainlike\nstructure where all sites visited by the polymer are occupied by two monomers.

One\npossibility is to integrate the state equations to obtain the free energy, this may be even\nperformed analytically for some simple models such as the Ising model [17]. In other cases\nit is possible to perform the integration numerically, using a Maxwell construction to locate\nthe discontinuous transition. A detailed discussion of this point was presented by Pretti\n[18], analyzing particularly the proposals of Gujrati to obtain the bulk free energy which\nwas presented above [13] and the one of Monroe, based on the Jacobian of the recursion\nrelations at the fixed point [19]. Also, a simple recursive criterion was used to find the\ncoexistence locus for a model of SASAW's on the Husimi lattice, which consists in iterating\nthe recursion relations imposing 'natural' initial conditions on the ratios. In the region of\nthe parameter space where the coexistence locus is located, there are at least two stable fixed\npoints, and the coexistence surface is proposed to be the boundary of the basins of attraction\nof the fixed points when the iteration is started with the 'natural' initial conditions. In the\nprevious studies of the MMS model on Bethe and Husimi lattices, the recursive procedure\n27\n\n\fwas used, but as shown above it lead to results which are even qualitatively different from\nthe ones obtained using the more controlled approach by Gujrati. Here we will discuss these\nquestions for a simpler model than the one above: SASAW's on the Bethe lattice, which\nwas studied some time ago [20].\nThe model is defined in the grand-canonical ensemble, so that z will be the activity of a\nmonomer incorporated in the chains. The endpoints of the chains are constrained to be on\nthe surface of the tree. A Boltzmann factor \u03c9 > 1 is associated to each pair of monomers\nin first neighbor sites of the tree which are not connected by a polymer bond, to take care\nof the attractive interactions. As usual, we define partial partition functions for subtrees.\nThe subtrees have a edge at the root which is connected to the root site, to which q \u2212 1\nsubtrees of the previous generation are attached. We call g0 the partial partition functions\nfor a subtree with no monomer on its root site, g1 will be the partial partition functions for\na tree with a monomer on the root site and no bond on the root edge, while g2 stands for\nthe partial partition functions of a subtree with a monomer on the root site and a bond on\nthe root edge. The recursion relations for these partial partition functions are easily found\nto be:\ng0\u2032 = ( g0 + g1 )q\u22121 ,\n\ng1\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\nz g22 (g0 + \u03c9 g1 )q\u22123 ,\n=\n2\n\ng2\u2032 = (q \u2212 1) z g2 (g0 + \u03c9 g1 )q\u22122 ,\n\n(A1a)\n\n(A1b)\n\n(A1c)\n\nProceeding as usual, we may define the ratios R1 = g1 /g0 and R2 = g2 /g0, and the recursion\nrelations for them are:\nR1\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n(1 + w R1 )q\u22123\nq\u22121\n.\nz R22\n(1 + R1 )q\u22121\n2\n\nR2\u2032 = (q \u2212 1) z R2\n\n(1 + w R1 )q\u22122\n,\n(1 + R1 )q\u22121\n\n(A2a)\n\n(A2b)\n\nWe should remark that the model was defined in a different but equivalent way in the\nearlier calculation [20], where an activity x was associated to each bond of the chains. Since\nall chains are long, as they are constrained to start at the surface of the tree, these two\n28\n\n\fformulations are equivalent. For example, the recursion relations (3.8) in this reference\ncorrespond to the ones presented here if we relate the ratios used in both calculations as\n\u221a\nA = zR2 and B = R1 , with x = (q \u2212 1)z.\nThe partition function of the model on the Cayley tree may be obtained if we consider\nthe operation of attaching q subtrees to the central site of the lattice:\n\u0012 \u0013\nq\nq\nz g22 (g0 + \u03c9g1)q\u22122 ,\nY = (g0 + g1 ) +\n2\n\n(A3)\n\nand, following Gujrati's prescription Eq.

(A2b), which in this case takes\nthe form\n(1 + R1P )q\u22121 \u2212 (q \u2212 1) z (1 + \u03c9 R1P )q\u22122 = 0 .\n\n(A6)\n\nFor the particular case q = 3 the fixed point equation above is quadratic, and a simple\nexpression may be found for the fixed point value of R1 :\nR1P = \u03c9z \u2212 1 +\n\np\n(\u03c9z \u2212 1)2 \u2212 1 + 2z.\n\n(A7)\n\nThe other root of the equation corresponds to an unstable fixed point. Once R1P is obtained,\nR2P may be found using the other fixed point equation, related to the recursion relation Eq.\n29\n\n\f(A2a), and is given by\n(R2P )2 =\n\n2\nRP (1 + \u03c9 R1P ) .\nq\u22122 1\n\n(A8)\n\nThe stability limit of this phase may be found by requiring the largest eigenvalue of the\nJacobian of the recursion relations Eqs. A2 to be equal to one. In general, the equation\ndefining this limit of stability has to be solved numerically, but for q = 3 it is simple to find\nthe result:\n1\n, for \u03c9 < 2,\n2\n2(\u03c9 \u2212 1)\n=\n, otherwise.\n\u03c92\n\nP\nzSL\n=\n\n(A9a)\n\nP\nzSL\n\n(A9b)\n\nThe tricritical point is obtained as the point on the critical line x = 1/(q \u2212 1) where\nR1 = 0 is a double root of Eq.(A6):\nzT C =\n\nq\u22121\n1\n\u03c9T C =\nq\u22121\nq\u22122\n\n(A10)\n\nThe first-order line\n\nFor \u03c9 > \u03c9T C the first-order transition line can be obtained using the condition \u03c6Pb (x, \u03c9) =\nP\n\u03c6N\n= 0, which gives\nb\n\n(1 +\n\nR1P )2 (q\u22121)\n\n\u0014\n\n= 1+\n\nR1P\n\nq\n(1 + \u03c9 R1P ) R1P\n+\nq\u22122\n\n\u0015q\u22122\n\n,\n\n(A11)\n\nIn general, this equation has to be solved numerically, but for q = 3 it is straightforward to\nobtain an analytical solution, which is:\nR1F O =\n\n\u221a\n\n3\u03c9 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 ,\n\n(A12)\n\nand, from Eq.

This is expected, since the densities of monomers\nand of interactions in the central region of the Cayley tree, calculated directly from the\npartition function Eq. (A3) are equal to the ones obtained from the bulk free energy per\nsite Eq. (A4). Let us now consider the iterative prescription suggested by Pretti in [8].

Dotted lines are the limits of stability of\nthe non-polymerized (right) and polymerized (left) phases. The dashed (red) line is the coexistence\nlocus between both phases obtained from the free energy, while the dash-dotted (blue) line is the\ncoexistence locus estimated using the recursive procedure.\n\niterates the recursion relations Eqs. (A2) starting with 'natural' initial conditions for the\n(0)\n\npartial partition functions g0\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n= 1, g1\n\n(0)\n\n= 0, and g2\n\n= z, so that the initial values for\n\n(0)\n\nthe ratios are R1 = 0 and R2 = z. One then estimates the coexistence line to be at the\npoint in the (z, \u03c9) parameter space where the fixed point reached iterating the recursion\nrelations switches between the non-polymerized and polymerized phases. The results of all\ncalculations for a lattice with q = 3 are displayed in the phase diagram in Fig. 10. The\nNIC method leads to a first order line which is clearly different from the one obtained using\nthe bulk free energy. Actually, in more complex models, the 'natural' initial conditions\nmay not be unique, and different choices for them could lead to different results for the\ncoexistence locus. The other methods to define the coexistence locus are defined solely by\nthe recursion relations and the partition function. Also, despite the intuitive physical appeal\nof the method, its justification based on more solid arguments is still lacking.\nAlthough in the SASAW's model discussed here the iterative procedure has lead only to\na quantitative error in the location of the first order line, qualitative differences can result\nin more involved models. An example is the MMS model. The DO and TO fixed points, do\nnot appear in the phase diagram despite the fact that the fixed points associated to them are\nactually stable in regions of the parameter space. This is due to the fact that the free energy\n\n31\n\n\fof the P1 and P2 phases is smaller in those regions. If, however, the iterative procedure is\nused, this will be no longer the case and those phases actually appear in the phase diagram,\nas may be seen in the particular case \u03c93 = 0 in reference [11]. For K = 3 both DO and TO\nphases appear in the phase diagram if the recursive procedure is used.\nFinally, we will briefly discuss the suggestion by Monroe [19] that at the coexistence\nthe leading eigenvalues of the Jacobian of both phases should be equal. We may consider\npoints on the coexistence line Eq. (A13) for q = 3. If the eigenvalue which corresponds to\nthe polymerized phase would be equal do the one associated to the non-polymerized phase\n\u03bbN P = 2z, then the expression:\n\u2206 = (J1,1 \u2212 2z)(J22 \u2212 2z) \u2212 J1,2 J2,1 ,\n\n(A14)\n\nwhere Ji,j are the elements of the Jacobian calculated at the polymerized fixed point, should\nvanish on the coexistence line. It may be shown that this expression does not vanish for\n\u03c9 > 2, thus showing that the Monroe criterium is not equivalent to the free-energy criterium\nfor this particular model. It is interesting to remark that in other models this equivalence\nwas found [18].\n\nAPPENDIX B: LOCATION OF THE MULTICRITICAL POINT\n\nTo find the location of the multicritical point in the parameter space of the model, we look\nfor higher order roots with vanishing ratios of the fixed point equations which follow if we set\nRi\u2032 = Ri in the recursion relations Eqs. 6. An inspection of the fixed point equations suggests\nthe following ansatz for the ratios close to the non-polymerized fixed point: R2 = aR12 and\nR3 = bR13 . We then substitute these leading order terms into the fixed point equations and\nrequire them to be satisfied up to order 4 in R1 . This furnishes five equations: from the first\nrecursion relation Eq. (6a) we get one equation for order R1 and another for order R12 . The\nsecond recursion relation Eq. (6b) furnishes two equations, one for order R12 and the other\nfor order R14 . Finally, recursion relation Eq. (6c) provides an additional equation for order\n\n32\n\n\fR13 . In the sequence adopted above, the equations are:\n1 = (q \u2212 1)\u03c91 ,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\n\u03c92 a,\n\u03c92 + 4\n\u03c91 = 3\n2\n3\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u03c92 + (q \u2212 1)\u03c92 a,\na =\n2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\n\u03c93 a2 +\n\u03c93 a + 4\n\u03c93 + 15\n\u03c91 a = 6\n2\n3\n4\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u22121\n\u03c93 b,\n6\n2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\n\u03c93 a + (q \u2212 1)\u03c93 b.\n\u03c93 + 2\nb =\n2\n3\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(B1a)\n(B1b)\n(B1c)\n\n(B1d)\n(B1e)\n\nThese equations may easily be solved, leading to \u03c91 = 1/(q \u2212 1), \u03c92 = 1/(q \u2212 1)2 , \u03c93 =\n\n1/(q\u22121)3 , a = 1/2, and b = 1/6. The behavior of the ratios in the vicinity of the multicritical\npoint has been verified numerically.\n\n[1] P. J.
