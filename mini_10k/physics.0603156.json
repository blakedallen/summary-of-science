This method\nprovides a powerful tool for molecular identification of compounds contained in complex matrices,\nsuch as environmental samples. In particular, EM-MS has been applied to the detection of nitrated\naromatic compounds, many of which are potent mutagens and/or carcinogens and are considered\nenvironmental hazards. EM-MS expands the application and selectivity of traditional MS through\nthe inclusion of a new dimension in the space of molecular characteristicsthe electron resonance\nenergy spectrum. EM-MS also enhances detection sensitivity as well because the entire electron\nflux of the proper energy can be delivered into the negative ion resonance that is analytically most\nuseful to solving the problem at hand. However, before this tool can realize its full potential, it\nwill be necessary to create a library of resonance energy scans from standards of the molecules for\nwhich EM-MS offers a practical means of detection. Unfortunately, the number of such standards\nis very large and not all of the compounds are commercially available, making this library difficult\nto construct. Here, an approach supplementing direct measurement with chemical inference and\nquantum scattering theory is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of directly calculating resonance energy spectra. This approach makes use of the symmetry of the transition-matrix element\nof the captured electron to discriminate between the spectra of isomers. As a way of validating this\napproach, the resonance values for twenty-five nitrated aromatic compounds were measured along\nwith their relative abundance. Subsequently, the spectra for the isomers of nitrotoluene were shown\nto be consistent with the symmetry-based model. The initial success of this treatment suggests\nthat it might be possible to predict negative ion resonances and thus create a library of EM-MS\nstandards.\n\n2\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeveloping analytical instrumentation with high detection sensitivity and selectivity\nis crucial to our abilities to solve meaningful analytical problems that challenge the nation. Among the more sensitive analytical techniques are those employing gas chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis (GC/MS), where GC-retention time, mass, and intensity\nare molecule selective, and therefore useful for molecular identification. For a number of\nyears, researchers have sought to expand on MS detection methods by using a monochromatic electron beam of varying energy to scan an unknown analyte. In a process called\ndissociative electron capture, electrons of specific energies are captured to produce ions\nof characteristic masses that can be detected as a fragment ion with MS. In effect, the\nresonance energy spectrumion yield as a function of electron energycreates an additional\nmolecular characteristic to supplement those produced with traditional GC/MS.\nThe trochoidal electron monochromator (EM), which uses an axial magnetic field to\nprevent spreading of the electron beam, was first introduced by Stamatovic and Schultz\n[1, 2]. Illenberger et al. then modified and interfaced the EM to a mass spectrometer and\ndemonstrated the ability to produce negative ions and ion fragments along with ion yield\ncurves as a function of electron energy using EM-MS [3, 4]. More recently, Laram\u00e9e et al.\nused Illenbergers design to further improve the use of the EM in MS applications [5, 6]. This\ndevice was reported to allow the ionization energy to be precisely controlled to \u00b1 0.3 eV\nwith ion currents only slightly below those observed for electron ionization.\nJEOL USA, Inc. (Peabody, MA) has designed and interfaced an EM similar to that of\nLaram\u00e9e et al. for use in a commercially available mass spectrometer. This instrument\nproduces spectra of negative ion current as a function of electron energy (Figure 1). For\nexample, the three isomers of mono-nitrotoluene show two negative ion resonances at distinct\nelectron energies, viz, 0.5 and 3 eV. The relative abundance of the lower energy peak is\ndistinct for the 2-nitrotoluene isomer. These spectra suggest that a new analytical approach\ncould be applied for analysis of complex mixtures that are capable of ionization by electron\ncapture and have led analytic chemists to explore the technique more fully [7, 8]. However, a\nnumber of theoretical and technical issues must be addressed before the technique can begin\nto fill its full potential. Key among these are: (1) a demonstration that different molecules\ngive rise to different electron resonance spectra (ERS), and (2) that once a spectrum is\n3\n\n\fobtained, it can be associated with the molecule, or class of molecules, from which it arose.\nFirst steps in addressing issue (1) above have been taken by Laram\u00e9e et al. [6] who have\nused EM-MS to study a limited number of pesticides, explosives, organofluoro compounds,\npolychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic compounds,\nand nitrated aromatic compounds. Here, we expand on this work by determining the ERS\nof twenty-five nitrated aromatic compounds some of which are representative of those found\nin explosives, diesel soot, and tobacco smoke. Generally the electron resonance of these\ncompounds is linked to the detachment of a nitro group, NO\u2212\n2 , which can be identified by\nscanning the electron energies associated with the m/z 46 peaks [6, 9, 10, 11].\nAddressing issue (2) above is more difficult. One approach is simply to create a library of\nERS for all molecules of potential interest. Another approach would be the direct calculation\nof electron resonance spectra that could further serve to supplement experimentally obtained\nstandards. Such an approach is presented and used to distinguish the isomers of nitrotoluene.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODS\nA.\n\nChemicals.\n\nHexafluorobenzene and all nitroaromatic compounds were purchased from either SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO) or Accustandard, Inc. (New Haven, CT) and were used without\nfurther purification. The standards were diluted or dissolved into toluene (ChromAR grade,\nMallinckrodt Chemicals, Phillipsburg, NJ) at a concentration of 100 ng/\u03bcL.\n\nB.\n\nInstrumentation.\n\nA JEOL trochoidal EM has been interfaced to a JEOL MStation JMS 700-T four sector\nmass spectrometer. The filament potential, with respect to its center, was scanned from\n-3 to 12 eV with an electron current of 20 \u03bcA, The energy resolution was \u00b1 0.4 eV. A\n6.0 kV accelerating voltage was used, the resolution was set to 1000, and the EM source\ntemperature was 280 C. The electron energy scale was calibrated using nitrobenzene and\nhexafluorobenzene standards introduced to the ionization source via a heated reservoir. The\nmolecular ion of nitrobenzene (m/z 123) was assigned a resonance energy value of 0.06 eV,\n\n4\n\n\fwhile the first and second NO\u2212\n2 (m/z 46) resonance peaks were assigned values of 1.2 eV\nand 3.5 eV, respectively [5].\nFor hexafluorobenzene, the molecular ion (m/z 186) was assigned a value of 0.03 eV,\nwhile the first and second m/z 167 peaks from the C6 H\u2212\n5 fragment were assigned 4.5 eV\nand 8.3 eV, respectively [12] One microliter of each sample solution was injected onto an\nHP 6890 Series GC equipped with an on-column injector port to avoid degradation of the\ncompounds at the inlet. A 30-m ZB-5 column set to 280 C was used for resonance energy\nmeasurements except for 1,3-dinitropyrene, in which the column temperature was set to 300\nC.\nThe electron energy scans were carried out using a JEOL electron monochromator power\nsupply modified with an energy sweep board. A Tektronix (Beaverton, OR) TDS2022 twochannel oscilloscope interfaced to the JEOL NIR Energy Sweep Utility program was used\nfor data acquisition.\n\nC.\n\nCalculations.\n\nAll first principle calculations were done using the Amsterdam Density Functional code\n[13] The correction to the exchange and correlation specified by Perdew-Wang [14] were used\nfor all calculations. Triple zeta and double zeta basis sets including polarization terms were\nused. The symmetry arguments presented here were not altered by the choice of basis set.\n\nD.\n\nExperimental Results.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the major parameters which we believe distinguish one ERS from\nanother: namely, the energies and relative intensities of both the electron-capture resonances\ntypical of nitrated aromatic groups. The variation in these parameters, particularly the\nvanishing of the lower energy resonance for some compounds, e.g. 2-nitrophenol, suggests\nthat these parameters will potentially be useful in molecular identification.\nUnfortunately, as noted before, the extent to which this potential is realized will depend\nsensitively on the ability to assign a molecule to its spectrum. In the absence of any clear\nrules that associate molecular structure with spectra, the enormous task of creating an ERS\nlibrary must be confronted. Rather than taking on this task in full, an initial attempt has\n\n5\n\n\fbeen made here to create a model of dissociative electron capture, from which rules linking\nstructure to ERS might be inferred. Thus, providing the motivation for future work to\ndirectly calculate these spectra.\n\nIII.\n\nA MODEL FOR DISSOCIATIVE ELECTRON CAPTURE\n\nBegin by considering the reaction\ne\u2212 + AB \u2192 A\u2212 + B\n\n(1)\n\nwhere AB is an isomer of nitrotoluene and B is the negatively charged nitro fragment and\nA, a toluene radical. The radical toluene fragment is much more massive than either the\nelectron or the nitro fragment. Ignore the kinetic energy of the toluene fragment and take\nas the Hamiltonian\nH = Te + TB + Ve\u2212A + VAB + Ve\u2212B\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Te and TB are the kinetic energies of the electron and the nitro fragment, respectively;\nVe\u2212A and Ve\u2212B are the interactions of the electron with the toluene and the nitro fragments,\nrespectively; and VAB is the interaction of the nitro group and the toluene fragment.\nFollowing the work of Day et al. [15], we identify the toluene fragment to be a massive\n\"core.\" It is known [15] that the interactions with the core fragment can be eliminated from\nthe T-matrix element. In the first order Born approximation, the T-matrix element is given\nby\n~ e\u2212B |~k, \u03a6b i\nhA\u2212 , B|T |e\u2212 , ABi = h\u03c6, K|V\n\n(3)\n\nwhere |~ki is the unperturbed plane wave state of the incident electron, |\u03c6i is the molecular\norbital of the core that captures the electron, |\u03a6b i is the bound state of the nitro fragment\n\n~ is the plane wave state of the detached nitro fragment.\nto the core, and |Ki\n\nWith the nitro fragment so deeply bound to the toluene core initially, we make the further\n~ b i \u2248 \u03b4(R),\n~ giving\napproximation that hR|\u03a6\n1\nhA\u2212 , B|T |e\u2212 , ABi \u2248 \u221a h\u03c6|Ve\u2212B |~ki\n\u03a9\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the volume of the box used to normalize the continuum eigenstates.\nLastly, it is recognized, on the basis of ab-initio density functional calculations on nitrotoluene, that the incoming electron is attracted to the phenyl moiety and repelled by the\n6\n\n\fnitro group because a permanent dipole is present in this class of chemical compounds. Such\nan interaction is long-range, and over the extent of the short-range bound state in which\nthe electron is captured, the electron-nitro interaction can be approximated as a repulsive\nconstant, VeB \u2248 V0 .\n\nhA\u2212 , B|T |e\u2212 , ABi \u2248\n\nV0\n\u03a9\n\nR\n\n~\n\nd3~r eik*~r \u03c6\u2217 (~r)\n\u2261 V0 \u03c6\u2217 (~k)\n\u03a9\n\n(5)\n\nBy Fermi's Golden Rule, the reaction rate averaged over all molecular orientations\u2013a\nquantity closely related to the electron capture resonance spectra\u2013 is given by\nZ 3~\nd Kd\u03a9k ~ 2\nV02\n|\u03c6(k)| \u03b4(\u01ebk + \u01eb\u03c6 \u2212 EK \u2212 \u2206)\n\u0393=\n2~\u03a9\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01ebk is the incident electron kinetic energy, EK is the final fragment kinetic energy, \u01eb\u03c6\nis the electron binding energy for the capturing orbital, and \u2206 is the binding energy of the\nnitro fragment to the toluene core. Thus, the essential component needed for the calculation\nof the resonance spectra from first principles is nothing more than the Fourier transform of\nthe capturing orbital.\nThe difficulty in evaluating this matrix element is ascertaining into which of the many\nmolecular orbitals the incident electron is initially captured. However, inspection of Table 1\nsuggests that in the case of nitrated aromatic compounds, attention may be restricted to the\nunoccupied \u03c0-orbitals. The rationale behind this conclusion derives from the observation\nthat the resonance energies do not vary substantially among compounds characterized by\nstrikingly different functionalities, e.g. nitrophenol and nitrotoluene, both of which show primary resonances close to 3.6 eV. Accordingly, the wavefunctions of the capturing molecular\norbital are also unlikely to show appreciable variation.\nThe only wavefunctions that could satisfy this constraint are those of the molecular \u03c0orbitals, which will be characterized by contributions from the pz orbitals of the nitro group\nand ring carbons (we take z to be normal to the aromatic ring). Ring functionalities without\n\u03c0-electrons, e.g. methyl or hydroxyl groups, will contribute only modestly to these molecular\n\u03c0-orbitals.\nIn the case of substituted phenyl compounds, like the isomers of nitrotoluene, there\nare three unoccupied \u03c0-orbitals that should be considered, the structure of which can be\n7\n\n\fpredicted from simple nodal arguments, Figure 2. The lowest lying of the three will be the\nmolecular LUMO and possesses two nodal planes, neither of which contains the nucleus of\na ring carbon atom. This forces the nitro-to-ring interaction to be \u03c0-bonding. The other\n\u03c0-orbital with two nodal planes is generally the LUMO + 1. One of its nodal planes contains\nthe ring carbon bound to the nitrogen atom, producing a non-bonding interaction between\nthe nitro group and the ring. At still higher energies is the fully anti-bonding \u03c0-orbital\ncharacterized by three nodal planes.\nBy virtue of the placement of its nodal planes, the nitro-to-ring nonbonding orbital will\nbe composed almost entirely of the pz atomic orbitals on the carbon atoms at the 2, 3, 5,\nand 6 positions relative to the nitro group. As such, we expect this orbital will be nearly\nidentical in the isomers of nitrotoluene and nitrophenol and thus is likely to be the orbital\ninto which the 3.6 eV electron is captured.\nAs a partial confirmation of this conjecture, in Figure 3 isosurfaces are shown for the\nLUMOs + 1 of 2-, 3-, and 4-nitrotoluene as computed from first principles using the Amsterdam Density Functional code [13]. As expected, these orbitals are similar and localized\non the ring, with very little amplitude on the nitro or methyl functionalities.\nWith a candidate capturing wavefunction, the energy of an incident electron that will\nmaximize the matrix element h~k|\u03c82 i must be determined. Here, |\u03c82 i is the state corresponding to the LUMO + 1. This observation invites the evaluation of the matrix element\nthrough a plane wave expansion of the capturing orbital and a direct determination of its\noverlap with an incident electron.\nHowever, as a first step, and as a means of testing our previous assumptions and building\nintuition, we begin with a semiquantitative analysis, noting that electron capture will be\ngoverned by a \"local symmetry\" that may be higher than that of the full molecule. This\nlocal symmetry is that of the potential only on those sites where the wavefunction of the\ncapturing molecular orbital has significant amplitude. Thus, from Figure 3 it is shown\nthat the symmetry governing the capture of an electron into the LUMO + 1 of 2-, 3-, or\n4-nitrotoluene will be that of the potential about the carbon atoms at the 2, 3, 5, and\n6 ring positions relative to the nitro group, for it is on these atoms that the LUMO is\nlocalized. Over this region, the symmetry is nearly D2h , and it will be this symmetry that\ngoverns electron capture into the LUMOs + 1 of the isomers of nitrotoluene. Under this\nlocal symmetry, if the capturing matrix element is to be nonzero, the capturing LUMO must\n8\n\n\fshare the same irreducible representation as the wavefunction of the incident electron.\nThe LUMOs + 1 of the isomers of nitrotoluene, all transform as the Au irreducible\nrepresentation of the D2h point group. And it is a straightforward exercise to project out\nthat component of a general plane wave with this symmetry. This exercise reveals the\nwavefunction of the incident electron to be, i sin(kx x) sin(ky y) sin(kz z), where kx , ky , and\nkz are the Cartesian components of the electrons wavevector. Note that the wavefunction\nvanishes, if any of these components is zero.\nThe Fourier transform of the LUMO + 1 has a substantial magnitude for wavevectors\ncorresponding to a phase shift of \u03c0 along a displacement vector connecting orbital lobes\nof opposite phase, as depicted in Figure 4A and B. The magnitude of this wavevector can\nbe estimated by placing the endpoints of the displacement vector in the regions of highest\namplitude for the orbital lobes. This displacement must be a half-wavelength to correspond\nto having the electron wavefunction undergo a phase change of \u03c0.\nIt is now possible to estimate the wavelength of the incident captured electron and hence\nits energy. The x-component of the displacement vectors shown in Figure 4A corresponds\nto the distance between neighboring ring carbon atoms, 1.4 \u00c5. The y-component is the\ndistance between carbon atoms meta to each other, 2.42 \u00c5. The z-component varies from\nan upper limit of 2 \u00c5 to a lower limit given by the distance between the LUMO extrema,\nor approximately 1 \u00c5. These values yield electron wavelengths between 6.9 and 5.9 \u00c5,\ncorresponding to wavevectors between, 0.9 and 1.1 \u00c5\u22121 , and electron energies between 3.2\nand 4.3 eV respectively. Using these values for kx , ky , and kz , a double isosurface for the\ncorresponding wavefunction is shown as Figure 4C, which, overlaps constructively over all\nspace with the molecular wavefunction, accounting for the large amplitude of the resonance\nat 3.6 eV.\nGiven the approximations involved, these are remarkable results. The experimental scans\nshow a broad electron resonance at 3.6 eV, but with a half width of nearly 1.5 eV. The\nsemiquantitative estimate is well within this margin of error, and correctly predicts the\npeak resonance energy. Further, the model attributes the observed width of the spectrum\nto the broadness of the Fourier transform of the LUMO + 1 around this optimum k-value,\nwhich is due, in part, to the slow decay of the pz atomic-wavefunctions normal to the ring.\nWhile the model presented thus far provides confidence that it is possible to identify\nthe structures responsible for electron capture, the real challenge is to apply the insight\n9\n\n\fgained to discriminate between isomers. Toward this end, the isomer-dependent amplitude\nvariations of a secondary electron resonance at about 1.0 eV are studied. The energy of this\nresonance also varies little between isomers, again suggesting that the capturing orbital is \u03c0\nin character. For the isomers of nitrotoluene, we believe, electron capture into the LUMO\nis responsible for this resonance.\nShown in Figure 5 are the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, calculated using the\nADF package, of 2-, 3-, and 4-nitrotoluene. There are significant differences. The local\nsymmetry of 3-nitrotoluene and 4-nitrotoluene are approximately C2v by virtue of a near\nreflection symmetry in the plane normal to the ring containing the carbon to nitrogen bond.\nHowever, 2-nitrotoluene has an asymmetric LUMO because of significant wave amplitude\non the methyl group, reducing the local symmetry to Ch . We believe this difference leads to\nthe larger secondary resonance intensity of 2-nitrotoluene compared to the other two isomers\n(see Figure 1).\nUnder the local C2v symmetry, the LUMOs of 3- and 4-nitrotoluene reduce as B1 . Projecting this component from a general plane wave gives the wavefunction of the incident\nelectron to be,\n\u03c6(kx , ky , kz ) = i cos(ky y) sin(kz z)(cos(kx x) + i sin(kx x))\n\n(7)\n\nAs is evident, the reflection symmetry in the xz and yz-planes requires the center of a\ncaptured electrons wavefunction to sit on the x-axis. There is only one set of wavevectors that\nsimultaneously satisfy this constraint and connect regions of opposite phase. The projection\nof these vectors in two planes is shown in Figure 6 along with the real component of the\nwavefunction of equation (8). Though these displacement vectors are of a length expected\nfor half the wavelength of 1.0 eV electron ( 12 \u00c5), the intervening region of opposite phase\nleads to significant cancellations between the wavefunctions of the incoming electron and\nthe LUMO. Thus, one can expect a weak resonance at about 1.0 eV, as is observed.\nThe symmetry reduction seen in the LUMO of the 2-nitrotoluene removes one of the\nconstraints on the incident electron wavevector, confining its center only to the xy-plane.\nNo longer tethered to the x-axis, a new family of wavevectors (also 12 \u00c5in length) contributes\nto the reaction rate. The projection of these wavevectors in the xy-plane is shown in Figure 7.\nBecause the center of these vectors has been displaced to a region of low LUMO amplitude,\nthe cancellation will be reduced over those of 3- and 4-nitrotoluene, leading to a more\n10\n\n\fpronounced 1.0 eV resonance, again, consistent with experimental observation.\nWhile the model has shown itself to be consistent only with the ERS for the isomers of\nnitroroluene, we are confident that it is general, at least as far as the isomers of nitrated\naromatics are concerned. This optimism is based, in part, on the extensive molecular orbital\ncalculations conducted on this series of compounds, most of which have not been reviewed\nhere. Still, the results are so promising that we believe a quantitative implementation of the\nmodel is in order. Accordingly, we have begun the coding of equation (6) with the intent\nof predicting ERS for a great number of compounds. The results will be discussed in a\nsubsequent paper.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that the utility of EM-MS as a tool for molecular identification can be\nenhanced through a two-step process. In the first, chemical inference is employed to identify\nthe molecular orbitals into which the monochromatic incident electrons are captured. In the\nsecond step, the principles of quantum scattering theory can be employed to calculate the\nfragmentation rate, and thus the ion yield as a function of electron energies. Though for\nsimple molecules, such as those studied here, such calculations are not necessary to explain\nspectral differences associated with different isomers. For more complex molecules, the direct\ncalculation of ion yield will be necessary. The tools necessary to perform these calculations\nare presently under development. We anticipate that these revelations will serve not only\nto accelerate the use of EM-MS for molecular identification, but also further stimulate a\nbroader interest in the use of first principle methods with analytical chemistry.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.\n\nThe authors thank Philip Morris USA and the Colorado Tobacco Research Program for\nsupport of this work.
