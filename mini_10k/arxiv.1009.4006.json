The Boltzmann equation. After Maxwell [57] wrote down the basic equation\nfor the kinetic theory of gases, Boltzmann [14] made such remarkable progress on\nthis equation that its name remained attached to it. The Boltzmann equation\ndescribes the behavior of a rarefied gas when the only interactions taken into account\nare binary collisions. This evolution equation reads\n\u2202f\n+ v * \u2207x f = Q(f, f ),\nx \u2208 \u03a9, v \u2208 Rd , t \u2265 0,\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03a9 \u2282 Rd is the spatial domain (d \u2265 2) and f is the time-dependent particle\ndistribution function in phase space. In the case when this distribution function is\nassumed to be independent of the position, equation (1.1) reduces to the spatially\nhomogeneous Boltzmann equation\n\u2202f\n(1.1)\n(t, v) = Q(f, f )(t, v), v \u2208 Rd , t \u2265 0,\n\u2202t\nwhere Q is the quadratic Boltzmann collision operator, defined by the bilinear\nform\nZ\n\u0001\nQ(g, f ) =\nB |v \u2212 v\u2217 |, cos \u03b8 (g\u2217\u2032 f \u2032 \u2212 g\u2217 f ) dv\u2217 d\u03c3.\nRd \u00d7Sd\u22121\n\u2032\n\nWe have used the shorthands f = f (v \u2032), g\u2217 = g(v\u2217 ) and g\u2217\u2032 = g(v\u2217\u2032 ), where\n\nv + v\u2217 |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\nv + v\u2217 |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\n+\n\u03c3 and v\u2217\u2032 =\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n2\n2\n2\n2\nstand for the pre-collisional velocities of particles which after collision have velocities\nv and v\u2217 . Moreover it is usual to introduce the deviation angle \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] between\nv \u2032 \u2212 v\u2217\u2032 and v \u2212 v\u2217 . The function B is called the Boltzmann collision kernel and\nit is determined by physics (it is related to the physical cross-section \u03a3(v \u2212 v\u2217 , \u03c3) by\nthe formula B = |v \u2212v\u2217 | \u03a3). On physical grounds (in particular Galilean invariance),\nit is assumed that B \u2265 0 and B is a function of |v \u2212 v\u2217 | and cos \u03b8 only.\nv\u2032 =\n\n1.2. The collision kernel. In the theory of Maxwell and Boltzmann, the interaction between particles is reflected in the formula for the collision kernel B. It may\nbe short-range or long-range. The most important case of short-range interaction\nis the hard spheres model, where particles are spheres interacting by contact. In\nthat case, B = |v \u2212 v\u2217 | in dimension d = 3 (constant cross-section).\nTypical models of long-range interactions are given by inverse power-law forces\n[27]. In dimension d = 3, if the intermolecular force scales like r \u2212s with s > 2, then\nB(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |, cos \u03b8) = |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\u03b3 b(\u03b8),\nwhere b is smooth except near \u03b8 = 0,\nb(\u03b8) \u223c\u03b8=0 cst \u03b8\u22122\u2212\u03bd ,\n\n\u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0],\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n3\n\nand\ns\u22125\n2\n,\n\u03bd=\n.\ns\u22121\ns\u22121\nIt will be interesting to also consider more general kernels B which do not necessarily come from microscopic interactions; a remarkable case is \u03b3 = 2.\nIn the important case of Coulomb interaction, the force scales like the inverse of\nthe square of the distance between particles; then the Boltzmann operator does not\nmake sense anymore [72, Annexe 1, Appendice]. This divergence led Landau [54]\nto introduce in 1936 a \"diffusive\" version of the Boltzmann collision operator, the\nLandau collision operator, defined by the bilinear form\n\u03b3=\n\n(1.2) Q(g, f ) = \u2207v *\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |)\n\nRN\n\n!\n\u001a\n\u001b\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n|v \u2212 v\u2217 | Id \u2212 (v \u2212 v\u2217 ) \u2297 (v \u2212 v\u2217 )\n(\u2207g)f\u2217 \u2212 (\u2207g)\u2217 f dv\u2217\nleading to the polar form\n(1.3) Q(f, f ) = \u2207v *\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |)\n\nRN\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n\n|v \u2212 v\u2217 | Id \u2212 (v \u2212 v\u2217 ) \u2297 (v \u2212 v\u2217 )\n\n\u001b\u0012\n\n\u2207f\n\u2207f\u2217\n\u2212\nf\nf\u2217\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\nf f\u2217 dv\u2217 .\n\nHere \u03a6(|v\u2212v\u2217 |) = |v\u2212v\u2217 |\u22123 and the dimension is d = 3. As in [36, 37] we can consider\nany dimension d \u2265 2 and more general functions \u03a6, say \u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |) = |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\u03b3 ,\n\u03b3 \u2265 \u2212d.\nA mathematical way to derive the operator (1.2) is to apply the grazing collision\nlimit to the Boltzmann collision operator with collision kernel B = \u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |) b(\u03b8),\nthat is, to concentrate on deviation angles \u03b8 \u2243 0 [7, 31, 33, 70, 4]. The case \u03b3 = \u22123,\nd = 3 considered by Landau in dimension d = 3 will be called \"Landau-Coulomb\"\nfor the sake of classification.\n1.3. Conserved quantities and entropy structure. Boltzmann's and Landau's\ncollision operators have the fundamental properties of conserving mass, momentum\nand energy\nZ\nQ(f, f )(v) \u03c6(v) dv = 0, \u03c6(v) = 1, v, |v|2/2\nRd\n\n\f4\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nand satisfying (the first part of) Boltzmann's H theorem, which can be formally\nwritten as\nZ\nZ\nd\nD(f ) := \u2212\nf log f dv = \u2212\nQ(f, f ) log f dv \u2265 0.\ndt Rd\nRd\nBoltzmann's so-called \"H functional\"\nH(f ) =\n\nZ\n\nf log f dv\n\nis the opposite of the entropy of the gas.\nThe second part of Boltzmann's H theorem states that under appropriate boundary\nconditions, any equilibrium distribution function (that is, such that v * \u2207x f =\nQ(f, f )) satisfies D(f ) = 0, or equivalently Q(f, f ) = 0, and takes the form of\na Maxwellian distribution\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1\n|v \u2212 u|2\nM(\u03c1, u, T )(v) =\n.\nexp \u2212\n(2\u03c0T )d/2\n2T\nThe parameters \u03c1 = 0, u \u2208 Rd and T \u2265 0 are interpreted as respectively the density,\nmean velocity and temperature of the gas:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03c1=\nf (v) dv, u =\nv f (v) dv, T =\n|v \u2212 u|2 f (v) dv.\n\u03c1\nd\u03c1\nd\nd\nd\nR\nR\nR\nAs a result of the process of entropy production pushing towards local equilibrium\ncombined with the constraints of conservation laws, solutions of the Boltzmann\nequation are expected to converge to a unique Maxwellian equilibrium (This is the\nKrasovskii\u2013Lasalle principle in the context of the Boltzmann equation).\nAssuming that \u03c1 and T are positive, we may rescale f := f (v) into v 7\u2192 a f (\u03bb (v \u2212\nb)), in such a way that the new density, velocity and temperature are \u03c1 = 1, u = 0\n2\nand T = 1. So we set M(v) = (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 e\u2212|v| /2 as the Maxwellian equilibrium in the\nsequel.\n1.4. The linearized collision operators. Let us first consider the Boltzmann\ncollision operator. We introduce the fluctuation around the Maxwellian equilibrium\nM computed above:\nf = M + Mh,\n\nv 7\u2192 h(v) \u2208 L2 (M)\n\nwhere L2 (M) denotes the Lebesgue space L2 on Rd with reference measure M(v) dv.\nThen the linearized collision operator writes\nLh = M \u22121 [Q(Mh, M) + Q(M, Mh)] ,\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n5\n\nor\n(1.4)\n\n1\nLh =\n4\n\nZ\n\nRd \u00d7Rd \u00d7Sd\u22121\n\nh\ni\nh\u2032 + h\u2032\u2217 \u2212 h \u2212 h\u2217 B M\u2217 dv\u2217 d\u03c3\n\nfor the same collision kernel B as in Q.\nIt is easy to check that L is symmetric in the Hilbert space L2 (M) and that it\nis non-positive in this space (this is the linearized form of the H theorem). The\ndissipation of squared L2 norm, that is the opposite of the Dirichlet form associated\nwith L, is\nZ\n2\n1\nD(h) = \u2212hh, LhiL2 (M ) =\nh\u2032 + h\u2032\u2217 \u2212 h \u2212 h\u2217 B M M\u2217 dv dv\u2217 d\u03c3 \u2265 0.\n4 Rd \u00d7Rd \u00d7Sd\u22121\n\nIt is straightforward from this formula that the null space of L has dimension d + 2,\nand is spanned by the so-called collisional invariants 1, v1 , . . . , vd , |v|2.\nIn the case of the Landau operator, a similar line of arguments leads to\n!\nZ\ni\nh\nLh(v) = M \u22121 \u2207v *\na(v \u2212 v\u2217 ) (\u2207h) \u2212 (\u2207h)\u2217 M M\u2217 dv\u2217 ,\nRd\n\nwith\n\na(z) = |z|2 \u03a6(z) \u03a0z \u22a5 ,\n\n(\u03a0z \u22a5 )i,j = \u03b4i,j \u2212\n\nzi zj\n,\n|z|2\n\nand the corresponding negative Dirichlet form is\n(1.5) D(h) = \u2212hh, LhiL2 (M )\nZ\n\u00112\n\u0010\n1\n=\nM M\u2217 dv dv\u2217 \u2265 0.\n|v \u2212 v\u2217 |2 \u03a6 (v \u2212 v\u2217 ) \u03a0(v\u2212v\u2217 )\u22a5 (\u2207h) \u2212 (\u2207h)\u2217\n2 Rd \u00d7Rd\n\n1.5. Comparison with usual differential operators and classification. The\nBoltzmann and Landau collision operators are a priori extremely intricate, partly\ndue to their integral or integro-differential nature (and partly of course due to their\nnonlinear nature!). Therefore it is useful, in order to grab an intuition of these operators, to draw a parallel with usual differential operators which are more familiar.\nFor the Boltzmann collision operators, say with collision kernel of the form B =\n\u03a6(|v\u2212v\u2217 |) b(|\u03b8|), the most important two \"parameters\" interplaying and determining\nits behavior are (1) the growth or decay of \u03a6, and (2) the singularity of b at grazing\ncollisions \u03b8 \u223c 0. To be more precise, let us consider the model case \u03a6(z) = z \u03b3 ,\n\u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, +\u221e) and b(|\u03b8|) \u223c \u03b8\u2212(d\u22121)\u2212\u03bd , \u03bd \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 2) as \u03b8 \u223c 0, for the Boltzmann\ncollision operator. Then the order of singularity (2) plays the role of the order\n(highest number of derivatives) in a differential operator. For instance \u03bd < 0 in the\nmodel means a zero order operator, whereas \u03bd \u2208 (0, 2) means a fractional differential\noperator with order \u03bd. And the growth or decay of \u03a6 (1) plays the role of the\n\n\f6\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\ngrowth or decay of the coefficients in a differential operator. Therefore \u03b3 = 0\n(the so-called Maxwell or pseudo-Maxwell molecules cases) would correspond to a\nconstant coefficients differential operator, and \u03b3 = 1 (similar to hard spheres) would\ncorrespond to unbounded polynomially growing coefficients.\nFrom this comparison it becomes natural to consider the Landau collision operator\nwith \u03a6(z) = z \u03b3 formally as the limit case \u03bd = 2 in the above classification. This\nunified picture of this family of integro-differential operators is summarized in figure\n1 below.\n\n\u03bd\nLandau\n\n2\nb\n\nLandau-Coulomb\n\nlong-range\n\nBoltzmann\n\n0\n\nhard spheres\nb\n\nshort-range\n\n\u2212d\n\n\u03b3\n\n1\n\nFigure 1. Classification of the Boltzmann and Landau operators\n\n2. Cercignani's conjecture\n2.1. Constructive quantitative estimates for the large time behavior. The\nrelaxation to equilibrium has been studied since the works of Boltzmann and it is\nat the core of kinetic theory. The motivation is to provide an analytic basis for the\nsecond principle of thermodynamics for a statistical physics model of a gas out of\nequilibrium. Indeed, Boltzmann's famous H theorem gives an analytic meaning to\nthe entropy production process and identifies possible equilibrium states. In this\ncontext, proving convergence towards equilibrium is a fundamental step to justify\nBoltzmann model, but cannot be fully satisfactory as long as it remains based on\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n7\n\nnon-constructive arguments. Indeed, as suggested implicitly by Boltzmann when\nanswering critics of his theory based on Poincar\u00e9's recurrence Theorem, the validity\nof the Boltzmann equation breaks for very large time (see [73, Chapter 1, Section 2.5]\nfor a discussion). It is therefore crucial to obtain constructive quantitative informations on the time scale of the convergence, in order to show that this time scale is\nmuch smaller than the time scale of validity of the model. Cercignani's conjecture\nis an attempt to provide such constructive quantitative estimates. In the words of\nCercignani: \"The present contribution is intended as a step toward the solution of\nthe first main problem of kinetic theory, as defined by Truesdell and Muncaster, i.e.\n\"to discover and specify the circumstances that give rise to solutions which persist\nforever\".\" It is inspired by the entropy - entropy production method, that we now\nbriefly describe.\n2.2. The entropy - entropy production method. This method was first used\nin kinetic theory for the Fokker-Planck equation (Cf. [8, 67])\nZ\nd\n\u2202t f = \u2207v * (\u2207f + v f ), v \u2208 R ,\nf (w) dw = 1.\nRd\n\nIn that case, the equilibrium M is given by the formula\nM(v) = (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 e\u2212|v|\n\n2 /2\n\nand the entropy production is\nDF P (f ) =\n\nZ\n\nRd\n\nf (v) \u2207 log\n\nf\nM\n\n2\n\ndv.\n\nThe exponential convergence is then obtained thanks to the logarithmic Sobolev\ninequality (cf. [45]), which exactly means in this setting\n\u0014\n\u0015\nDF P (f ) \u2265 2 H(f ) \u2212 H(M) .\n\nConsider the more general case of an equation for which a Lyapunov functional\nH\u2217 exists, that is\nd\nD\u2217 (f (t)) := \u2212 H\u2217 (f (t)) \u2265 0\ndt\nand assume that the entropy \u2212H\u2217 is maximal for a unique function M\u2217 (among\nthe functions belonging to a space depending on the conserved quantities in the\nequation). As seen in the previous section, this structure is provided by the H theorem for Boltzmann and Landau equations. The entropy - entropy production\nmethod consists in looking for (functional) estimates like\n\u0001\nD\u2217 (f ) \u2265 \u0398 H\u2217 (f ) \u2212 H\u2217 (M\u2217 ) ,\n\n\f8\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nwhere \u0398 : R+ \u2192 R+ is a function such that\n\u0398(x) = 0\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nx = 0.\n\nThe stronger \u0398 increases near 0 the better the rate of relaxation to equilibrium,\nsince the differential inequality\n\u0001\n\u0001\nd\nH\u2217 (f ) \u2212 H\u2217 (M\u2217 ) \u2264 \u2212 \u0398 H\u2217 (f ) \u2212 H\u2217 (M\u2217 )\ndt\nleads to\nH\u2217 (f (t)) \u2212 H\u2217 (M\u2217 ) \u2264 R(t),\nwhere R is the reciprocal of a primitive of \u22121/\u0398. Then, if the relative entropy\nH\u2217 (f ) \u2212 H\u2217(M\u2217 ) is coercive in the sense that it controls from below some distance or\nsome norm (denoted by k k\u2217 ) between f and its associated equilibrium distribution\nM\u2217 (for the Boltzmann entropy this is precisely provided by the so-called CzizsarKullback-Pinsker inequality, see [29, 53]), we obtain\nkf (t) \u2212 M\u2217 k\u2217 \u2264 S(t),\nwhere (generically)\nS(t) = C R(t)1/2 .\nIn the particular case \u03a6(x) = C x (like in the case of the Fokker-Planck equation),\none gets\n\u2032\nR(t) \u2264 C e\u2212C t ,\ni.e., exponential convergence towards equilibrium (with explicit rate). In the\nslightly worse case \u03a6(x) = C\u03b5 x1+\u03b5 for some (or all) \u03b5 > 0 we can deduce\nR(t) \u2264 C\u03b5\u2032 t\u22121/\u03b5 ,\nand we thus get algebraic convergence towards equilibrium (with explicit\nrate). When \u03b5 > 0 can be taken as small as one wishes, we speak of almost\nexponential convergence.\n2.3. Cercignani's conjecture. The original Cercignani's conjecture [28] is written\nin the following form: for any f and its associated Maxwellian state M with same\nmass, momentum and temperature\n\u0014\n\u0015\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb \u03c1 H(f ) \u2212 H(M) ,\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density (mass of f ) and \u03bb > 0 is a \"suitable constant\".\nWe shall now develop this very general statement into a layer of more specified\nconjectures. Let us fix \u03c1 = 1 without loss of generality.\nIn the case when the constant \u03bb only depends on the collision kernel B, the\ntemperature of M (or f ), and some bound on the entropy of f (i.e., only the\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n9\n\nbasic physical a priori estimates), we shall call this inequality the strong form of\nCercignani's conjecture.\nIn the case when the constant \u03bb also depends on some additional bounds on f\n(typically of smoothness, moments and lower bounds), we shall call such an inequality the weak form of Cercignani's conjecture. Let us point out that it is of\ncrucial importance to know whether the bounds used can be shown to be propagated by the Boltzmann equation, in order to be able to \"apply\" the weak form\nof Cercignani's conjecture to the relaxation to equilibrium of its solutions. This of\ncourse guides which bounds are natural or not.\nIn the slightly different case when the following inequality holds\n\u0002\n\u00031+\u03b5\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 H(f ) \u2212 H(M)\n, \u03b5>0\nwe shall speak of the \u03b5-polynomial Cercignani's conjecture and it can be divided\nagain into weak and strong versions according to how much the constant \u03bb\u03b5 depends\non f .\nFinally a strictly similar hierarchy of conjectures can be formulated on the Landau\nentropy production functional, and we shall call it Cercignani's conjecture for\nthe Landau equation.\n\n2.4. A linearized counterpart to the conjecture. A natural linearized counterpart of Cercignani's conjecture for the Boltzmann or Landau equation consists\nin replacing the entropy production functional and the Boltzmann entropy by their\nlinearized approximation, i.e., respectively the Dirichlet form of the collision operators discussed above and the L2 (M) norm. This spectral gap question was already\nwell-known for a long time and used by Cercignani as an inspiration and supportive\nargument for his conjecture in [28]. So let us call this the linearized Cercignani's\nconjecture:\nD(h) \u2265 \u03bb kh \u2212 \u03a0(h)k2L2 (M ) ,\nwhere \u03a0 denotes the orthogonal projector in L2 (M) onto the null space of the\nlinearized collision operator, and \u03bb only depends on the collision kernel B and the\ntemperature of M.\nNote that due the linear homogeneity of this relation, no weak version (with\nconstant depending on the function h) would make sense.\nAgain obviously the same question can be asked on the Dirichlet form of the\nLandau collision operators and leads to the linearized Cercignani's conjecture\nfor the Landau equation.\n2.5. Comparison with differential operators. In the light of the comparison we\nhave made with usual differential operators, a functional inequality interpretation of\nCercignani's conjecture is the following. Its nonlinear form is an intricate (because of\n\n\f10\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nstrong nonlinearity and average over additional angular variables) amplified version\nof a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Its linearized form is an intricate (because\nagain of average over additional angular variables) amplified version of a Poincar\u00e9\ninequality.\n2.6. Use of the collision kernel, weighted forms of the conjecture. A natural\ngeneralization of the conjecture is to know whether an inequality of the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb Hw (f ) \u2212 Hw (M)\n\nholds, where\n\nHw (f ) :=\n\nZ\n\nf log f w(v) dv\n\nfor some weight function w > 0. This requires the additional moment normalization\nZ\nZ\n2\nf w |v| dv = M w |v|2 dv\n\nin order for the relative entropy to satisfy\n\nHw (f ) \u2212 Hw (M) \u2265 0.\nWe shall call such an inequality a weighted Cercignani's conjecture.\nIn the linearized case, a natural conjecture is similarly\nD(h) \u2265 \u03bb k(h \u2212 \u03a0(h)) wk2L2(M ) ,\nfor some weight function w, and we shall call such an inequality a linearized\nweighted Cercignani's conjecture.\n2.7. Semigroup form of the conjecture. Another natural related question is\nthe following. Cercignani's conjecture at the end of the day is a purely functional\ninequality, and has nothing to do with the solutions of the Boltzmann equation.\nHowever the main application of this conjecture is of course the rate of convergence\nto equilibrium for the Boltzmann equation. Hence a natural question is whether\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2200 t \u2265 0, D(ft ) \u2265 \u03bb H(ft ) \u2212 H(M)\n\nfor any solution (ft )t\u22650 , or for a subset of solutions to the spatially homogeneous\nBoltzmann equation. We shall call this the strong semigroup Cercignani conjecture.\nThis conjecture is of course related to the weak functional form of the conjecture\nin the sense that if appropriate conditions are found on f for which the latter holds,\nand these conditions are shown to be propagated by the solutions to the Boltzmann\nequation, then this strong semigroup form of the conjecture will hold. However it\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n11\n\nis possible to imagine weird conditions created by the semigroup that cannot be\nsimply identified at the purely functional level.\nLet us first remark that Cercignani's conjecture does not exhaust the issue of\nthe rate of relaxation towards equilibrium, since it is possible that an exponential\nconvergence occurs for the semigroup even without any functional inequality1. Hence\nit is natural to weaken again the semigroup conjecture in the following form. The\nweak form of the semigroup Cercignani conjecture is the following: is it true\nthat\n\u2032\n\u2200 t \u2265 0, H(ft ) \u2212 H(M) \u2264 C e\u2212C t\nfor some positive constants C, C \u2032 > 0, and any solutions (ft )t\u22650 , or for a subset of\nsolutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation.\nLet us add as a final remark that obvious extension to these semigroup forms of\nthe conjecture can be drawn for the spatially homogeneous Landau equation.\n2.8. Relation with mean-field limit. Let us mention the different but closely\nrelated question raised by Kac [51]. In this paper Kac introduced a many-particle\njump process whose mean-field limit is the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation (he also introduced the mathematical formalization of the by-now well-known\nnotion of propagation of chaos for a many-particles system). One of the goals of\nsuch a derivation was the understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the nonlinear\nBoltzmann equation through the linear many-particles system. Hence it is natural\nto search for a Cercignani's conjecture at the level of the many-particles jump\nprocess. Even if this process is linear the conjecture can be searched in nonlinear\nform or linear form, the difference being the kind of functional which is used for\nmeasuring the spectral gap (the Boltzmann entropy or an L2 norm). The specific\nnew difficulty is to track the dependency of the estimates in terms of the number of\nparticles (since the final goal is originally to pass to the limit). For recent results in\nthe \"linear\" case (spectral gap in L2 ) see for instance [40, 50, 22, 56] which solves\nthe problem (note however that since the L2 norm does not \"tensorize\" correctly in\nhigh dimension, it is not possible to pass to the limit in these estimates), and see\n[74, 21, 58] for some progress in the \"nonlinear\" case.\n3. Negative results at the functional level\n3.1. Counterexample in the Maxwell molecules case with only mass, energy and entropy bounds. The explicit solutions constructed by Bobylev [10, 11]\nshow in particular that the exponential rate of relaxation can be arbitrarily slow if\n1Think\n\nfor instance of the trivial example of a nonsymmetric matrix A with only negative\neigenvalues: its Dirichlet form will not control anything from below since it has no sign, although\nthe semigroup etA will obviously relax exponentially fast towards zero.\n\n\f12\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\none assumes only finite mass, energy and entropy (in the cutoff Maxwell molecules\ncase B = 1). The question was then: would the conjecture be true with better\ngrowth of the collision kernel than B = 1, for instance in the important physical\ncase of hard spheres B = |v \u2212 v\u2217 |?\n3.2. Counterexample in the hard spheres case with higher moment bounds.\nThen Wennberg [78] proved in 1997 that the conjecture was false also in the case\nof hard spheres. However the counterexample of Wennberg does not have infinitely\nmany moments. And since it was known since [34] that hard potentials with cutoff\n(\u03b3 > 0 and no angular singularity) would produce such higher moments at every\norder for any positive time, the next natural question was whether such counterexamples would hold with infinitely many moments.\n3.3. Counterexample with infinitely many moment bounds. It was finally\nshown by Bobylev and Cercignani in [13] that, for hard potentials with angular\ncutoff and with \u03b3 < 2, the estimate\nh\ni\nD(f ) \u2265 C(f ) H(f ) \u2212 H(M)\n\ndoes not hold uniformly over any class of distributions f which have fixed mass,\nmomentum and energy, are bounded below by a uniform Maxwellian distribution,\nand satisfy\nkf kH k \u2264 Sk , kf kL1 (1+|v|s ) \u2264 Ms\nfor some given sequences Ms > 0, s \u2208 N and Sk > 0, k \u2208 N. This is still true if an\narbitrary number of the constants Ms and Sk are chosen arbitrarily close to their\nequilibrium value (i.e., the value of the corresponding moment or Sobolev norm for\nthe Maxwellian distribution associated with f ).\n4. Positive results at the functional level\n4.1. Early attempts. A first result was proved in 1979 by Aizenmann and Bak\nin [1] on a nonlinear model bearing some reminiscence to the Boltzmann operator, namely a coagulation-fragmentation kernel with constant rate. The proof uses\ntwo very cleverly devised convexity inequalities and this is probably the first example of a linear relation between entropy and entropy production for a non-diffusive\nBoltzmann-like equation.\nFor the Boltzmann and Landau equations, an inequality linking the entropy dissipation towards an L1 -type distance to the space of Maxwellian (instead of the\nentropy!) was established by the first author in [32], for densities bounded below by\na Maxwellian.\nA decisive improvement was the discovery of a link between the entropy and the\nentropy dissipation of the Boltzmann equation, due to Carlen and Carvalho in the\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n13\n\nbeginning of the 90s (Cf. [17, 18]): this link was however still far from linear, the\nrelation was of the form\n\u0001\nD(f ) \u2265 \u0398 H(f ) \u2212 H(M) ,\n\nfor some nonlinear function \u0398, but no information was given on the behavior of\nthe function \u0398 at zero, and it turns out that its behavior was much worse than\nlinear. The inequality was proved in the case of pseudo-Maxwell molecules and its\nproof made crucial use of the theory of Wild sums. As an elaborated consequence\nof this breakthrough let us also mention the paper [24] where the authors give (for\na constant collision kernel) the first proof of the convergence of the entropy towards\nits equilibrium value with minimal assumptions on the initial datum (finite mass,\nenergy and entropy).\n4.2. Landau equation with (over)-Maxwellian molecules. The first positive\nresult obtained with a linear dependence between entropy and entropy dissipation\n(for Landau or Boltzmann operators) is due to the first and third author of this\npaper, and concerns Landau's operator in the case when \u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |) \u2265 C\u03a6 > 0\n(sometimes called \"over-Maxwellian\"):\nh\ni\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb H(f ) \u2212 H(M) ,\nwith \u03bb > 0 depending on C\u03a6 and the dimension d only (for all f with fixed mass,\nmomentum, energy and upper bound on the entropy). In other words, the strong\nconjecture holds for Landau equation with over-Maxwellian molecules.\nThis result is obtained by observing that (for some \u03bb\u2032 > 0)\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb\u2032 DF P (f ),\nand then by using the logarithmic Sobolev inequality.\nThe relationship between D(f ) and DF P (f ) can be obtained (Cf. [37]) either\nthanks to an almost explicit computation in which spherical coordinates are used,\nor thanks to a variant of the estimates of [32] (in which differential operators have\nbeen replaced by integral operators).\n4.3. Boltzmann equation: \"almost linear\" relation. Successive results by\nToscani and the third author of this survey (Cf. [68, 69, 74]) then led to a result valid for the Boltzmann equation with any reasonable collision kernel. That\nis, when B \u2265 C min{|v \u2212 v\u2217 |\u03b3 , |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\u2212\u03b2 } > 0, with \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2265 0 (with or without\ncutoff, that is for any \u03bd \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 2)) the following \"almost linear link\" exists between\nentropy and entropy production:\nh\ni1+\u03b5\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 (f ) H(f ) \u2212 H(M)\n,\n\n\f14\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nwhere \u03bb\u03b5 (f ) (possibly going to 0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0) depends on \u03b2, \u03b3, C, kf kH s(\u03b5) , kf (1 +\n|v|)k(\u03b5)kL1 for some s(\u03b5) and k(\u03b5) depending on \u03b5 (and blowing up as \u03b5 \u2192 0), and\nsome Gaussian (or better) lower bounds. In other terms, the (weak) \u03b5-polynomial\nCercignani's conjecture holds for the Boltzmann operator with all reasonable collision kernels.\n4.4. Boltzmann equation: linear relation. Finally, in the special (and unfortunately non physical) case when \u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |) \u2265 C\u03a6 (1 + |v \u2212 v\u2217 |2 ) > 0, the original\n(strong) Cercignani's conjecture was proved to hold by the third author of this paper\n(Cf. [74]), that is:\nh\ni\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb H(f ) \u2212 H(M) ,\n\nwith \u03bb > 0 only depending on C\u03a6 and the energy and entropy of f .\n\n4.5. Spectral gaps of linearized operators. The origin of the study of the spectral properties of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator can be traced back all\nthe way to Hilbert [49] in his work on the integral operators. The integral collision\noperator of Boltzmann was a key example and motivation from physics there, and\nHilbert introduced (in the case of hard spheres, i.e., \u03b3 = 1 and \u03bd < 0 in dimension\nd = 3) the splitting between the local and non-local parts of the linearized operator, and proved the \"complete continuity\" (compactness in today's words) of its\nnon-local part. This result was important in the construction, together with the\nFredholm theory, of what is now called the \"Hilbert expansions\".\nThe second key step is due to Carleman [16]. In this book he introduced (still\nin the hard spheres case) the use of Weyl's theorem (stating that under certain\nassumptions, the essential spectrum is unchanged by a compact perturbation of the\noperator), in order to prove the existence of a spectral gap of the linearized collision\noperator. Grad [43] then generalized this result to a broader class of collision kernels\n(the so-called hard potentials with cutoff, \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1], \u03bd < 0). Further generalizations\nof this non constructive approach were provided by Caflisch [15] and Golse and\nPoupaud [42] who proved that in the case of soft potentials with angular cutoff\n(\u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, 0) and \u03bd < 0) there is no spectral gap but still a weighted form of the\nconjecture holds (in weaker norms than the ambiant norm).\nAnother direction of research was investigated by Wang-Chang and Uhlenbeck\n[76] and Bobylev [11], who obtained a complete diagonalization of the linearized\ncollision operator in the Maxwell molecules case (\u03b3 = 0).\nIn the paper [9], by Baranger and the second author of this survey, the first\nconstructive estimates were given for the spectral gap of the hard spheres model,\nby introducing a geometric method and the idea of using \"intermediate\" collisions\nin the regions where the collision kernel vanishes, and then rely on the explicit\ndiagonalization of the Maxwell case above (for a constant collision kernel). The\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n15\n\npaper [60] then developed a whole series of constructive coercivity estimates, most\nof them sharp, and gives a full answer to the linearized Cercignani's conjecture in\nthe cutoff case (and some ellipticity estimate in the non-cutoff case, see below).\nThe interested reader can find more details in the review paper [62].\n4.6. Elliptic estimates in the long-range case. A different but related subject\nis the issue of proving ellipticity estimate on the entropy production functional in\nthe long-range case \u03bd \u2208 (0, 2). The first results are due to Lions [55] and then to the\nfirst and third authors of this paper, together with Alexandre and Wennberg ([71]\nand [2]) and can be roughly stated as the following inequality\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD(f ) \u2265 C kf kH \u03bd/2 \u2212 kf (1 + |v|s )kL1\nloc\n\nfor some s \u2208 N and some constant C > 0, and where the exponent \u03bd/2 of regularization is related to the singularity of the collision kernel. These regularity estimates\nwere used in a crucial way in the papers [3, 4] by Alexandre and the third author\nof this survey in the Cauchy theory of the long-ranged Boltzmann equation and its\ngrazing collision limit towards the Landau equation. Earlier an estimate based on\nthe entropy production had already been used in a crucial way in the paper [70] in\nthe Cauchy theory of the spatially homogeneous long-ranged Boltzmann with soft\npotentials.\nThe corresponding (and sharper) regularity estimates for the Landau equation\nwere derived in the papers [36, 37] by the first and third authors of this survey.\nNow if we consider the linearized case, the first related result for the Boltzmann\ncollision operator is due to Pao [66] who proved the compactness of the resolvent in\nthe case of inverse power-law interaction force F (z) = z \u2212s with s > 3 in dimension\nd = 3 (this paper was hard to read because of the use of pseudo-differential calculus,\nand somewhat controversial, see [52]). However, some more general and constructive\nversions of these results were recovered by the new estimates proven by Strain and\nthe second author of this paper in [65], confirming that the latter paper was fully\ncorrect. In short the paper [65] proves that a \"gain\" of \u03bd polynomial weight occurs\nin the long-ranged case due to the ellipticity of the operator: roughly speaking the\nlocal regularization improves the behavior for large velocities. The recent work by\nGressman and Strain [44] finally gives a sharp (although intricate) characterization\nof the elliptic norm associated with the Dirichlet form, and answers a conjecture\nraised in [65] about the spectral gap in the non-cutoff case (see below).\nFor the linearized Landau operator, the non-constructive approach based on\nWeyl's theorem was used successfully by Degond and Lemou [30] to prove an elliptic coercivity estimate. The sharp (non-isotropic) norm was then devised by Guo\nin [47] and some constructive versions of this coercivity result were given in [65] (see\nalso [48] for related sharp hypoellipticity results).\n\n\f16\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\n5. Results on the semigroup Cercignani conjecture\nSince up to this date no results are known on the strong semigroup Cercignani's\nconjecture, we shall review the results on the weak semigroup conjecture (about the\nrate of decay of the semigroup).\nThe first paper which tackled the issue of exponential relaxation to equilibrium\nfor data not necessarily close to equilibrium is [6] where a non constructive result\nis given by Arkeryd, Esposito and Pulvirenti in the hard spheres case for general\nsolutions in weighted L\u221e spaces in the spatially homogeneous case, or solutions\nweakly inhomogeneous (close to the latter setting). This approach was generalized\nto an Lp setting in [77] by Wennberg.\nIn the papers [26, 23], Carlen, Carvalho and Lu give sharp lower (and upper)\nbounds on the rate of relaxation to equilibrium for the semigroup of the spatially\nhomogeneous Boltzmann equation in the case of Maxwell molecules and soft potentials. Let us also mention the related important works by Carlen, Carvalho and\nGabetta [19, 20], more focused on the specific issue of the Wild sums.\nThe paper [25] by Carlen, Gabetta and Toscani then gave a proof of exponential\nconvergence towards equilibrium in the particular case of Maxwell molecules with\ncutoff, assuming moments and regularity bounds on the initial datum.\nIn the Maxwell molecules case with angular cutoff (\u03b3 = 0, \u03bd < 0 in the classification above), Carlen and Lu proved in [26] that when only 2 moments are assumed\non the initial datum, then a rate of convergence algebraic and as slow as wanted\ncan be explicitely obtained, and it depends very precisely on the integrability of the\ninitial datum, in the sense that it depends on the function \u03c6 = \u03c6(v) > 0 (going to\ninfinity as v goes to infinity) such that\nZ\nfin (1 + |v|2 ) \u03c6 dv < +\u221e.\nThis was the first example of a solution to the Boltzmann equation that actually\nrelaxes slower than exponentially towards equilibrium.\nIn the soft potential case with or without angular cutoff (\u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, 0) and \u03bd < 2),\nCarlen, Carvalho and Lu [23] proved (among other things) that for solutions with\nonly 2 + |\u03b3| moments then again the convergence (in L1 ) can be algebraic and\narbitrarily slow.\nMore recently a whole program of research has been carried out by the first and\nthird author in order to develop a theory of relaxation to equilibrium in the large for\ninhomogeneous kinetic equations, and in particular for the full Boltzmann equation\nin confined domain under a priori smoothness and moments assumptions (see in particular the papers [38, 39]). The rate is not exponential, but still almost exponential\n(in the sense of a polynomial convergence for any polynomial). These works have\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n17\n\nprovided new insights on how transport effects combined with the thermalization\nprocess in velocity can yield convergence towards the global equilibrium and they\nhave given birth to the new hypocoercivity theory.\nFinally the last episode in this long research line on the rate of decay in the\nBoltzmann H theorem is the development of new tools in spectral theory for nonsymmetric operators in order to systematically enlarge the functional space of the\ndecay on a linearized semigroup (this is used for connecting the linearized theory\n[9, 63] in small L2 (M \u22121 )-type spaces with the nonlinear theory [74, 39] in L1 type\nspaces). A \"final answer\" (constructive exponential relaxation of the relative entropy\nunder reasonable a priori estimates) was given in [61] for hard spheres in the spatially\nhomogeneous case, and then in the preprint by Gualdani, Mischler and the second\nauthor of this survey [46] for the inhomogeneous case (confined in the torus).\n6. New conjectures about the conjecture\nWe shall now present a few conjectures related to the results presented in this\npaper, some of them already formulated, some of them new. The work in progress\n[35] aims at giving partial answers to some of these conjectures.\n6.1. The use of grazing collisions. In [74] the following conjecture is formulated:\nConjecture 1 (Villani). For a collision kernel with growth of order \u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, +\u221e)\nand singularity of order \u03bd \u2208 [0, 2] (where \u03bd = 2 formally plays the role of the Landau\ncollision operator), the strong form of Cercignani's conjecture is true if and only if\n\u03b3 + \u03bd \u2265 2.\nThis conjecture formally extends the result proved in [74] for \"superquadratic\"\ncollision kernels (formally \u03bd = 0 and \u03b3 \u2265 2), as well as the result obtained in [37]\nfor the Landau collision operator with hard potential (formally \u03bd = 2 and \u03b3 \u2265 0).\nIn [65] it is conjectured the following\nConjecture 2 (Mouhot-Strain). For a collision kernel with growth of order\n\u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, +\u221e) and singularity of order \u03bd \u2208 [0, 2] (where \u03bd = 2 formally plays the\nrole of the Landau collision operator), the strong form of linearized Cercignani's\nconjecture (existence of a spectral gap for the linearized operator) is true if and only\nif \u03b3 + \u03bd \u2265 0.\nThe direct implication in this conjecture was proved in [65], and recently the work\n[44] (and the preprints related to this annoucement note) has solved this conjecture\nby providing a sharp characterization of the norm associated with the Dirichlet\nform of the operator. Let us also mention as an example of the fertility of Cercignani's conjecture that this conjecture also has inspired the work [64] about fractional\nPoincar\u00e9 inequalities.\n\n\f18\n\nLAURENT DESVILLETTES, CL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT & C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nAn interesting open question which now calls for further understanding is why\nthere is such a \"gap\" between the condition \u03b3 + \u03bd \u2265 2 for a \"nonlinear\" spectral\ngap, and the condition \u03b3 + \u03bd \u2265 0 for a linearized spectral gap (this is somehow\nreminiscent of the gap between the conditions for a logarithmic Sobolev inequality\nto hold or a Poincar\u00e9 inequality to hold).\n6.2. Use of (general) collision kernels. In view of the preceding conjectures\nabout the influence of the parameters \u03b3 and \u03bd (both at the nonlinear and linearized\nlevels), it now seems natural to conjecture the following generalized weighted form\nof Cercignani's conjecture:\nConjecture 3. For a collision kernel with growth of order \u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, +\u221e) and\nsingularity of order \u03bd \u2208 [0, 2] (where \u03bd = 2 formally plays the role of the Landau\ncollision operator), one has\nZ\nf\n(1 + |v|)\u03b3+\u03bd\u22122 dv\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb f log\nM\nat the nonlinear level and\n\nD(h) \u2265 \u03bb\u2032 k(h \u2212 \u03a0h)(1 + |v|)\u03b3+\u03bd kL2 (M )\nat the linearized level (where h = (f \u2212M)/M denotes the rescaled fluctuation around\nthe equilibrium M, and \u03a0 the L2 (M)-orthogonal projection onto the collision invariants 1, v1 , . . . , vd , |v|2).\n6.3. Use of the tail of the distribution. In view of the condition for a measure\n\u03bc = e\u2212V to satisfy a Poincar\u00e9 inequality (essentially that V grows faster than linearly\nat infinity) or a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (essentially that V grows faster than\nquadratically at infinity), see for instance [75], it is natural to ask whether some\nbounds on the tail of the distribution with faster decay than polynomial could\nhelp in order to obtain Cercignani's conjecture (this would be compatible with the\ncounterexamples of [13]):\nConjecture 4. For a collision kernel with growth of order \u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212d, +\u221e) and\nsingularity of order \u03bd \u2208 [0, 2] (where \u03bd = 2 formally plays the role of the Landau\ncollision operator), and for a distribution f with exponential tail\n\u03b7\n\nf (v) \u223c C e\u2212a|v| ,\n\nv\u223c\u221e\n\nfor some constants a, C > 0 and \u03b7 \u2208 (0, 2], one has\nZ\nf\nD(f ) \u2265 \u03bb\nf log\n(1 + |v|)\u03b3+\u03bd+\u03b7\u22122 dv\nM\nat the nonlinear level.\n\n\fCERCIGNANI'S CONJECTURE FOR THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n19\n\nHence if this conjecture were true (and taking for granted Villani's conjecture),\nit would mean that Cercignani's conjecture would hold for hard spheres and inverse\npower-laws interactions in dimension d = 3 for initial data with strong enough exponential tail (a Gaussian tail would always work). These exponential tails are known\nto be propagated by the spatially homogeneous nonlinear Boltzmann equation for\nhard spheres and hard potentials with cutoff [12, 61] (see also [41] in the case of\nGaussian tails).\nConcerning general initial data, one has to turn to the theory of appearance of\nexponential moments, as developed in [61, 59]. However it only provides at the\n\u03b7\nmoment an appearance of an L1 decay of the form e\u2212a|v| with \u03b7 = \u03b3/2. Even with\nthe improvement to \u03b7 = \u03b3 in the recent work in progress [5], note that the hard\nspheres case (say \u03b3 = 0 and \u03bd = 0) is exactly borderline for Cercignani's conjecture,\nand for inverse power-laws in dimension d = 3 where \u03b3 = (s \u2212 5)/(s \u2212 1) and\n\u03bd = 2/(s \u2212 1), then 2\u03b3 + \u03bd = 2 \u2212 6/(s \u2212 1) is always less than 2, and hence this\nwould not be sufficient for Cercignani's conjecture.\nOf course a natural further question would be to know whether the grazing collisions \u03bd > 0 can help for the appearance of exponential moments (for instance with\n\u03b7 = \u03b3 + \u03bd instead of \u03b7 = \u03b3). . . As the reader sees, the story opened by Cercignani's\nconjecture is far from finished, and it is likely that many more nice surprises are to\ncome.\nAcknowledgments: The authors wish to thank the ANR grant CBDif for support.\nThe second author wishes to thank the Award No. KUK-I1-007-43, funded by the\nKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) for the funding\nprovided for his repeated visits at the University of Cambridge during the autumn\n2009 and the spring 2010.\nReferences\n[1] Aizenman, M., and Bak, T.
