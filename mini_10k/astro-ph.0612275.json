INTRODUCTION\n\nObservations of Ly\u03b1 absorption lines in the spectra\nof QSOs provide a sensitive probe of the evolution and\nthe distribution of the gas in the universe from high\nto low redshift. A forest of H I absorption lines occurs at different redshifts, z, along QSO sightlines with\nlog NHI < 17. Understanding the evolution of the Ly\u03b1\nforest with redshift is critical to understanding the evolution and formation of structures in the universe. At\nz & 1.5, observations of the Ly\u03b1 forest are obtained\nfrom ground-based telescopes at a spectral resolution of\n7\u20138 km s\u22121 using 8\u201310 m class telescopes (e.g., Hu et al.\n1995; Lu et al. 1996; Kirkman & Tytler 1997; Kim et al.\n1997, 2002a), but at z \u2264 1.5 they require UV spacebased instruments. Space-based UV astronomy has produced remarkable results, including the discovery itself\nof the Ly\u03b1 forest at low redshift (Bahcall et al. 1991;\nMorris et al. 1991). However, most of the UV studies\nof the IGM at low z have lacked the spectral resolution\n1 Based on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far\nUltraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. FUSE is operated for NASA by\nthe Johns Hopkins University under NASA contract NAS5-32985.\nBased on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space\nTelescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which\nis operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under NASA contract No. NAS5-26555.\n2 Department of Physics, University of Notre Dame, 225 Nieuwland Science Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556\n3 Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin, 475 North\nCharter Street, Madison, WI 53706\n4 Argelander-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie, Universit\u00e4t Bonn, Auf\ndem H\u00fcgel 71, 53121 Bonn, Germany\n5 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive, Baltimore, MD 21218.\n6 Department of Astronomy, University of Massachusetts,\nAmherst, MA 01003.\n\nand wavelength coverage of the higher redshift studies\n(Weymann et al. 1998; Impey et al. 1999; Penton et al.\n2000, 2004), requiring assumptions for the Doppler parameter to derive the column density. The situation at\nz . 0.5 has dramatically improved in the last few years\nwith high quality observations of several low redshift\nQSOs obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nand its Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).\nIn its E140M echelle mode, STIS provides a spectral resolution of \u223c7 km s\u22121 , comparable to the resolution of\nthe high redshift observations of the Ly\u03b1 forest. The\nhigh spectral resolution has allowed the derivation of accurate Doppler parameters, b, and column densities, N ,\nusing techniques similar to those used at high redshift.\nThe Doppler parameter is important because it is related\nto the temperature of the gas via b2 = b2th + b2nt , where\nbnt is the non-thermal\nbroadening\np\n\u221a of the absorption line\nand bth = 2kT /m = 0.129 T is the thermal broadening of the H I absorption line; therefore the measured\nb directly provides an upper limit to the temperature of\nthe observed gas.\nIn parallel, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of\nthe local universe have quickly evolved in recent years\n(Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999; Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al.\n2001; Cen & Fang 2006; Cen & Ostriker 2006). These\nmodels predict that at low redshift roughly 30\u201350% of\nthe baryons are in a hot (105 \u2013107 K) and highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) known as the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium (WHIM), 30\u201340% are in a cooler\nmedium (. 104 K) photoionized by the UV background,\nand the remaining baryons are in galaxies. Observationally, Penton et al. (2004) found with moderate spectral\nresolution (FWHM \u223c20 km s\u22121 ) UV observations that\nthe cool phase of the IGM may contain 29% of the baryon\n\n\f2\n\nLehner et al.\n\nbudget. The observational detection of the WHIM came\nfirst from an intensive search of collisionally-ionized O VI\nsystems and other highly ionized species such as Ne VIII\nusing space-based observatories such as the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and HST/STIS (e.g.,\nTripp, Savage, & Jenkins 2000; Danforth & Shull 2005;\nSavage et al. 2005). The baryon content of the O VI\nabsorbers suggests that \u03a9b (O VI) & 0.0022h\u22121\n70 or at\nleast 5% of the total baryon budget (Sembach et al. 2004;\nTripp et al. 2006; Danforth & Shull 2005), but this estimate relies critically on the assumed oxygen abundance\nand the number of collisionally ionized O VI systems versus photoionized O VI systems (Prochaska et al. 2004;\nLehner et al. 2006). The O VI systems probe the lower\nend of the WHIM temperature range (T < 106 K).\nHigher temperatures can be traced with more highly ionized oxygen ions (O VII, O VIII) that can be observed\nin principle with X-ray observatories such as Chandra (Nicastro et al. 2005; Fang et al. 2006) and XMMNewton, but the IGM detections of O VII and O VIII are\nstill controversial (Kaastra et al. 2006; Rasmussen et al.\n2006) for z > 0.\nThe WHIM can also be detected through broad H I\nabsorption lines. The high temperature of the WHIM\nwill broaden the Ly\u03b1 absorption line resulting in a\nlarge Doppler parameter (b > 40 km s\u22121 ). A very\nsmall fraction of H I (typically < 10\u22125 ) is expected to\nbe found in the highly ionized plasma of the WHIM,\nso that the broader the H I absorption line is, the\nshallower it should be.\nRecent observations, both\nwith moderate spectral resolution and with the higherresolution STIS E140M echelle mode, have revealed the\npresence of broad H I absorption lines that could be\nmodeled by smooth and broad Gaussian components\n(Tripp et al. 2001; Bowen et al. 2002; Richter et al. 2004;\nSembach et al. 2004; Lehner et al. 2006). H I absorbers\nwith b < 40 km s\u22121 imply that the temperature of these\nabsorbers must be T < 105 K. Since the nominal lower\ntemperature of the WHIM is T \u223c 105 K, it is a priori\nnatural to consider two different physical populations of\nH I absorbers: the narrow Ly\u03b1 absorbers (NLAs) as H I\nsystems having b < 40 km s\u22121 and the broad Ly\u03b1 absorbers (BLAs) as H I systems having b \u2265 40 km s\u22121 .\nWe will see that the separation between the NLAs and\nBLAs is not so evident observationally, with an important overlap between the two populations, particularly\nin the range b = 40\u201350 km s\u22121 . While it is clear that\nthe NLAs are tracing mostly the cool photoionized IGM,\nthe situation is less clear for the BLAs. There is a\nfuzziness in the separation of the BLAs from the NLAs\nbecause non-thermal broadening can be important and\nunresolved components can hide the true structure of\nthe H I absorbers. Recent simulations show that nonthermal broadening could be particularly important for\nthe H I absorbers with 40 . b . 60 km s\u22121 (Richter et al.\n2006a). Therefore BLAs may probe photoionized gas\n(that can be either cool (T . 104 K) or hot (T & 105 K)\nbut with a very low density (log nH < \u22125.3)) and collisionally ionized, hot (T & 105 K) gas. In this paper, we\ndefine a BLA as an absorber that can be fitted with a\nsingle Gaussian component with b > 40 km s\u22121 (a NLA\nhas b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 and can have multiple components).\nBLAs probe the IGM that is either hotter (bth \u226b bnt )\n\nor is more kinematically disturbed (bnt \u226b bth ) than the\nIGM probed by the NLAs. Studying in detail the NLA\nand BLA populations is also important for estimating\nthe baryon density because an accurate inventory of the\nbaryon distribution must separate the fraction of the\nbaryons that are located in the cool photoionized IGM\nversus those that are in the substantially hotter shockheated WHIM phase. The narrow and broad Ly\u03b1 lines\nprovide a means to discriminate between the cool and\nshock-heated gas clouds. Therefore to make a reliable\nassessment of the baryonic content of the Ly\u03b1 forest at\nlow z, it is necessary to investigate the frequency and\nproperties of the NLAs and BLAs. The current estimate\nof the baryon budget residing in the BLAs over a redshift\npath \u2206z = 0.928 yields \u03a9b (BLA) & 0.0027h\u22121\n70 or at least\n6% of the total baryon budget (Richter et al. 2006b), assuming that the observed broadening is mostly thermal\nand collisional ionization equilibrium applies.\nIn this paper, we will address these issues using a sample of 7 QSO sightlines that have been observed with\nboth STIS E140M and FUSE and for which the data\nhave been fully analyzed using similar techniques and\nare in press or to be submitted soon. While the spectral resolution of FUSE is only \u223c20 km s\u22121 compared to\n\u223c7 km s\u22121 for STIS E140M, FUSE gives access to several Lyman series and metal lines making the line identification more reliable and providing an unprecedented\ninsight of the physical conditions and metallicity. The\nfundamental parameters of the Ly\u03b1 forest lines (redshift\nz, column density N , and Doppler parameter b) were\naccurately determined using profile fitting of all the observed Lyman series lines. Because b could be derived,\nthis is the first time with a large sample that the properties of the Ly\u03b1 forest in the low redshift universe can\nbe studied as a function of b. The main aims of this\nwork are 1) to study the distribution and evolution of\nthe Doppler parameter of the Ly\u03b1 forest, and 2) to determine the baryon density of the Ly\u03b1 forest in the NLA\nand BLA populations. The organization of this paper is\nas follows: \u00a72 describes the sample and its completeness;\nin \u00a73 we study the distribution of the Doppler parameter\nb and the Ly\u03b1 density number as a function of b; in \u00a74 we\nstudy the evolution of b with redshift by comparing the\nlow-z (z . 0.4) Ly\u03b1 forest with the mid-z (0.5 . z . 1.5)\nand high-z (1.5 . z . 3.6) Ly\u03b1 forest; in \u00a75 we estimate\nthe column density distribution; and finally, in \u00a76 we estimate the baryon content of the cool photoionized IGM\nprobed by the NLAs and the photoionized IGM and the\nWHIM probed by the BLAs, and discuss the uncertainties in estimating the baryon budget. We summarize our\nresults in \u00a77.\n2. THE LOW Z SAMPLE\n2.1.

(2006) and appendix of this\npaper.\n\nPG 1116+215 (Sembach et al. 2004), and PKS 0405\u2013123\n(Williger et al. 2006; see also Prochaska et al. 2004 for\nthe metal-line systems). Note that for HS 0624+6907, we\nused the results summarized in the erratum produced\nby Aracil et al. (2006b). The data handling and analysis are described in detail in the above papers. For\nPKS 0405\u2013123, we adopt the new measurements and a\nnew line list that we describe in the Appendix. The motivation to revisit Williger et al.'s analysis was first driven\nby differentiating a real detection from a noise feature\nfor the BLAs since these authors noted that several of\ntheir BLAs could be just noise. This re-analysis also provides an overall coherent data sample that was analyzed\nfollowing the same methodology. Signal-to-noise (S/N)\nwhere Ly\u03b1 can be observed, redshift (z), unblocked redshift path (\u2206z), and absorption distance (\u2206X) are summarized in Table 1 for each sightline. The absorption\ndistance was computed assuming a Friedman cosmology,\n\u2206X = 0.5[(1 + \u2206z)2 \u2212 1] with q0 = 0. For the lines\nof sight to QSOs with zQSO < 0.42, we have excluded\nabsorption systems within 5000 km s\u22121 of the QSO redshift. Some observations of low-redshift QSOs have provided evidence that \"intrinsic\" absorption lines can arise\nin clouds that are spatially close to the QSO and yet, due\nto the cloud kinematics, are substantially offset in redshift from the QSO (e.g., Yuan et al. 2002; Ganguly et\nal. 2003). To avoid contaminating the sample with these\nintrinsic absorbers, we do not use systems detected with\n5000 km s\u22121 of the QSO. The Voigt profile fitting method\nwas employed for each line of sight to measure the column\ndensities (NHI ), Doppler parameters (b), and redshifts of\nthe absorbers and we adopt those results for our analysis. Table 2 lists these parameters. For PG 1259+593\nwe did not include in our sample the systems marked\nuncertain (UC) in Table 5 of Richter et al. (2004). A\ncolon in Table 2 indicates that there is uncertainty in\nthe determination of the physical parameters, which are\nnot accounted for in the formal errors produced by the\nprofile fitting. These systems are not taken into account\nwhen we use an error cutoff (see below). If we had, it\nwould not have changed the results presented in this paper in a statistically significant manner.\nThe total sample consists of 341 H I systems, with a\ntotal unblocked redshift path \u03a3\u2206z = 2.064 and a total\n\n3\n\nabsorption distance \u03a3\u2206X = 2.404. There are 201 systems at z \u2264 0.2 and 131 systems at 0.2 < z \u2264 0.4. The\nremaining 9 systems lie at 0.4 < z < 0.44. Therefore,\nour sample mostly probes the universe at z \u2264 0.4. More\nabsorbers are found at z < 0.2 because several lines of\nsight do not extend out to z = 0.3\u20130.4 and to a lesser\nextent because the S/N at \u03bb > 1650 \u00c5 decreases rapidly\n(see below).\nTABLE 2\nH I measurements\nz\n\nlog NHI\n(dex)\n\nb\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nH 1821+643 (Sembach et al. 2006, in

The detection limit depends\non the S/N and the breadth over which the spectrum is\nintegrated. The matter is complicated by the S/N not\nbeing constant over the full wavelength range from \u223c1216\n\u00c5 to \u223c1730 \u00c5 available with STIS E140M where Ly\u03b1\ncan be observed; in particular, it deteriorates rapidly at\n\u03bb > 1650 \u00c5. Only lines of sight with z & 0.32 can reach\nthe last 100 \u00c5 of the STIS E140M wavelength coverage.\nNote that 297 systems with z \u2264 0.32 are observed at\nwavelengths \u03bb . 1650 \u00c5. For example, in one of the\nlowest S/N spectra in our sample (HE 0226\u20134110), we\nestimate that at \u223c1700 \u00c5, a 3\u03c3 limit is \u223c75 m\u00c5 for the\nprofile integrated over \u03b4v = [\u221250, 50] km s\u22121 and \u223c100\nm\u00c5 over \u03b4v = [\u221290, 90] km s\u22121 . We estimate that our\nsample is complete for log N (H I) & 13.20 (corresponding\nto a rest frame equivalent width W1215 \u2243 88 m\u00c5) at\na 3\u03c3 level for b . 80 km s\u22121 . For the high S/N lines\nof sight (H 1821+643, PG 1259+593, and PG 1116+215),\nthis limit is quite conservative. For systems with b > 80\nkm s\u22121 and log N (H I) & 13.20, our sample is incomplete,\nespecially at z \u2265 0.32 and for the lowest S/N spectra.\nSince our sample is not homogeneous with respect to\nthe achieved S/N, it is useful to have a sample in which\nthe cloud parameters are relatively well determined so\nthat scatter due to noise is reduced. We therefore consider systems with errors on b and NHI that are less than\n40%. The sample has 270 H I systems with errors on b\nand NHI that are less than 40%. In this case, there are\n155 systems at z \u2264 0.2, 107 systems at 0.2 < z \u2264 0.4,\nand 8 systems at 0.4 < z < 0.44. At the completeness\nlevel log N (H I) \u2265 13.20 and with errors on b and NHI\nless than 40%, there is a total of 202 H I systems with\n109 systems at z \u2264 0.2, 85 systems at 0.2 < z \u2264 0.4, and\n8 systems at 0.4 < z < 0.44.\n2.2. Overview of the Distributions of NHI , b, z\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show the distribution of the column density for each line of sight and the total sample (last panel,\nwhere we show the completeness limit of the sample) for\nsystems with NHI \u2264 1014 cm\u22122 and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4.\nAbout 86% of the absorbers have NHI \u2264 1014 cm\u22122 and\n\n\f6\n\nLehner et al.\n\nFig. 1.- Distribution of the column density of H I for each sightline and the combined sample with a column density interval of 6 \u00d7 1012\ncm\u22122 . Only data with NHI \u2264 1014 cm\u22122 and less than 40% errors in b and NHI are considered. The vertical dashed line on the complete\nsample marks the completeness limit of NHI = 1.6 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 .\n\n\u223c94% of them have NHI \u2264 1014.5 cm\u22122 . The column\ndensity distribution peaks near NHI \u223c 2 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122\nand drops sharply at smaller column densities. Since the\npeak of the distribution corresponds to about our completeness limit, the observed decrease of the number of\nsystems at NHI . 1.6 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 can be understood\nfrom the reduction in sensitivity. Higher S/N spectra\nwould be needed to further understand the distribution\nof the smaller column densities.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the distribution of the Doppler parameters for each line of sight and for the entire sample\n(last panel) with \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4. For every sightline, the b-distribution peaks between about 20 and 30\nkm s\u22121 . Yet, it is apparent that the distribution is not\nGaussian around these values, and, in particular, there\nare many systems with b & 40\u201350 km s\u22121 that produce a\ntail in the b distribution. This is clearly observed in the\nhistogram of the combined sample where b peaks around\n20\u201330 km s\u22121 with an excess of systems with b > 40\nkm s\u22121 compared to the number of systems with small b.\nThis preview already shows clearly that a mean b-value\ndoes not provide an adequate description of the Ly\u03b1 forest.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the distribution of the redshift for\neach line of sight with a redshift bin of 0.0033 (corresponding to 1000 km s\u22121 intervals). There is no striking difference between the different lines of sight, but\nthere are clearly voids and clustering in the distribution, consistent with the Ly\u03b1 forest tracing filaments of\nmatter in the universe. An example of clustering of absorbers is found near the system at z = 0.06352 toward\n\nHS 0624+6907 where at least 8 absorbers are found in a\nsingle bin and 17 absorbers are only separated by about\n3000 km s\u22121 . Aracil et al. (2006a) attribute this clustering to the absorption of intragroup gas, possibly from a\nfilament viewed along its long axis.\n3. DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOPPLER PARAMETER\n\nEarlier low-redshift UV studies of the H I forest have\nlow or moderate spectral resolutions and smaller wavelength coverage and did not allow access to several Lyman series transitions. Therefore, the Doppler parameter\nb generally had to be assumed and a study of the evolution and distribution of b was not possible (see for example the studies of Weymann et al. 1998; Penton et al.\n2000, 2004). With STIS E140M observations (spectral\nresolution of 6.5 km s\u22121 ), b can be derived from profile\nfitting analysis. Furthermore, combining STIS E140M\nand FUSE observations allows further constraints on b\nby using several Lyman series lines and reducing possible misidentifications. Here, we review the frequency and\nproperties of the narrow Ly\u03b1 absorbers (NLAs, b \u2264 40\nkm s\u22121 ) and the broad Ly\u03b1 absorbers (BLAs, b > 40\nkm s\u22121 ).\n3.1. Distribution of b and Other Low z Studies\n\nThe median b-value of 31 km s\u22121 for our combined sample is larger than the medians found in the low redshift\nIGM studies by Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001) and Shull et al.\n(2000). Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001) used automated software\nto derive b and N , but their criteria did not allow a search\nfor broad components. Shull et al. (2000) went only after\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\n\n7\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of the Doppler parameter of H I for each sightline and the combined sample. The observations are plotted in 6\nkm s\u22121 bins. Only data with less than 40% errors in b and NHI are considered.\n\nFig. 3.- Distribution of the redshift of H I for each sightline with a redshift interval of \u2206z = 0.0033. The arrows show the redshifts of\nthe QSOs. The wavelength coverage of the E140M mode of STIS limits Ly\u03b1 measurements to z . 0.42.\n\n\f8\n\nLehner et al.\n\nFig. 4.- Distribution of the Doppler parameter of H I for a\nseries of minimum log N (H I) for z . 0.4 for the seven sightlines.\nOnly data with less than 40% errors in b and NHI are considered.\n\nthe Ly\u03b2 absorption lines in the FUSE wavelength range\nto combine with known Ly\u03b1 absorption lines observed\nwith GHRS and were therefore less likely to find the\nbroad H I absorbers. Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001) found median\nand mean b-values of 22 km s\u22121 and 25 km s\u22121 , respectively. We find that the distribution of b is not gaussian,\nmaking the mean and dispersion less useful quantities. If\nwe restrict our sample to data with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 , the\nmedian and mean (with 1\u03c3 dispersion) are 27 km s\u22121 and\n27 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 . If only data with log N (H I) & 13.2 are\nconsidered, we obtain 29 km s\u22121 and 28 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 . If\nwe set the cutoff at b \u2264 50 km s\u22121 , the median and the\nmean increase by 2 km s\u22121 . The median, mean, and dispersion of b in our sample (with b \u2264 40 or 50 km s\u22121 )\ncompare well to those derived by Shull et al. (2000): 28\nkm s\u22121 and 31 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 for the median and mean, respectively.\nIn Fig. 4, we show the distribution of b for samples with\nvarious NHI cutoffs. For any NHI cutoff, the maximum of\nthe distribution always peaks near 25\u201330 km s\u22121 and in\nall cases there is clearly an asymmetry in the distribution\nwith the presence of a tail in the distribution that develops at b > 40\u201360 km s\u22121 . For the BLAs, the number of\nsystems with H I column between 13.0 and 13.2 dex is\nthe largest, although this could be in part an observational bias since weaker column density absorbers with\nb > 40 km s\u22121 would require higher S/N to be detected.\nAlthough the effects of line blending can contaminate the\nmeasurements of the observed tails, the various papers\ndescribing the data (see also Richter et al. 2006b) show\nthat a large fraction of these broad absorbers can be described with a single Gaussian within the S/N. For the\nstronger of these absorbers, several Lyman series lines\nwere also used to derive the physical parameters.\n3.2. The b\u2013NHI distribution\n\nThe b\u2013NHI distribution of the low redshift sample is\nshown in Fig. 5. The solid gray line shows the threshold\ndetection of H I absorbers. This curve is the relationship between b and NHI for a Gaussian line profile with\n\n10% central optical depth \u2013 absorption lines to the left\nof this line are not detectable. The lack of data with low\nb and log NHI . 12.7 is most likely because our sample\nis not complete at these low column densities. When\nabsorbers with log NHI & 13.2 and b > 0 km s\u22121 are\nconsidered, the b\u2013NHI plot reveals mostly a scatter diagram. Most of the absorbers are present in the column\ndensity range 13.2\u201314 dex. In Table 3, we list the median, mean, and dispersion of b for the entire sample,\nNLAs, and BLAs. For the entire sample, as expected\nfrom Fig. 5, it is not clear if b increases or decreases as\nNHI increases. A Spearman rank-order correlation test\non the entire sample with log NHI \u2265 13.2 shows a very\nmarginal negative correlation between b and NHI with a\nrank-order correlation coefficient r = \u22120.08 and a statistical significance t = 0.25. We note that when systems with log NHI . 13.2 are considered, it creates an\napparent correlation (r = 0.21 and t = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) between NHI and b, which can be understood in terms of\nmeasurement biases, since weak broad systems are more\ndifficult to detect than weak narrow absorbers. There is\nno clear separation between the NLAs and BLAs in this\nfigure, although we note that most BLAs are found at\nlog NHI . 14.0 and no BLAs with b > 50 km s\u22121 have\nlog NHI & 14.0 (see below). This scatter and absence of\nclear separation between NLAs and BLAs are expected\nif the H I lines trace systems with different temperatures\nand turbulent velocities.\nFor NLAs with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 and log NHI \u2265 13.2, we\nshow in Fig. 5 the median, mean, and dispersion of b\n(red curves and symbols) derived in six intervals of NHI .\nThese estimates are summarized in Table 3. This shows\nevidence of an increase of b with increasing NHI for the\nNLAs, at least for the weak absorbers with log NHI .\n14.1. The Spearman rank-order correlation test for the\nNLA sample shows a weak correlation between b and NHI\nwith r = 0.12 and t = 0.15. Since the sample is complete\nfor the NLAs, the increase of b with increasing NHI must\nbe real. The large scatter is again expected if the H I\nlines are broadened as a result of different temperatures\nand turbulent velocities.\nIn Fig. 6, we present the b\u2013NHI distribution only for\nthe BLAs (left panel), which shows that b appears to decrease with increasing NHI : For 13.1 . log NHI . 13.5\n(this range is highlighted in Fig. 6 by the vertical dotted\nlines), b is distributed between about 40 and 130 km s\u22121 ;\nfor 13.5 . log NHI . 14.0, b is mostly distributed between about 40 and 80 km s\u22121 ; and for log NHI & 14.0,\nb is always lower than 50 km s\u22121 . This trend is also\nconfirmed in the last two columns of Table 3 (note that\nin the [13.8,14.1] interval there are only 6 systems, with\n3 of them having b > 60 km s\u22121 and the other 3 having b \u223c 40 km s\u22121 ). The Spearman rank-order correlation for the BLA sample with log NHI \u2265 13.2 confirms a\nnegative correlation between b and NHI (r = \u22120.30 and\nt = 0.016).\nIn the right panel of Fig. 6, we show the recent simulation of BLAs undertaken by Richter et al. (2006a), in\nwhich artificial spectra were generated from the hydrodynamical simulation. Their numerical model was part of\nan earlier investigation of the O VI absorption arising in\nWHIM filaments (Fang & Bryan 2001), and they include\ncollisional ionization and photoionization processes. The\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\n\n9\n\nFig. 5.- Line width versus H I column density for the Ly\u03b1 absorbers along the seven sightlines. Only data with less than 40% errors\nin b and NHI are considered. The solid gray line shows b vs N (H I) for a Gaussian line shape with 10% central optical depth \u2013 absorption\nlines to the left of this line are not detectable. The dotted gray line shows the predicted minimum b-value from hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulations at low redshift (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999). The dot-dashed and long-dashed lines shows the fits to lower cutoff in the b distribution\nof high redshift systems (Kirkman & Tytler 1997; Kim et al. 2002b) (see \u00a73.2 for more details). The red histogram and red symbols show\nthe median b (triangles), the mean and dispersion of b (circles and vertical bars) in six bins of NHI only for data with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 (see\nTable 3).\n\nsimulated sample presented in Fig. 6 corresponds to their\nhigh-quality sample that includes 321 BLAs with almost\nperfect Gaussian profiles (note that 58% of the sample\nhas log NHI . 13.2). Since our observations are complete only to log NHI & 13.2, it is not surprising that\nwe are missing absorbers below this limit. It is, however, interesting to note that the simulation and observations have a similar trend: (i) most of the broadest\nabsorbers are found at log NHI . 13.5, and (ii) most of\nthe strong absorbers (log NHI & 14) have b . 50 km s\u22121\n(although we note that in the simulation a few systems\nhave b up to 65 km s\u22121 , and the simulation does not produce BLAs with log NHI & 14.4). This is also in general\nagreement with the simulation of the WHIM produced\nby Dav\u00e9 et al. (2001) where they show the WHIM fraction peaks for an overdensity \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 of \u223c5\u201330. If Eq. 2\n(see below) applies for the BLAs, the H I column density range 13.2 to 14.0 dex corresponds to \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u223c 5\u201317,\nin general agreement with the hydrodynamical simulations of Dav\u00e9 et al. (2001) if the BLAs trace mostly the\nWHIM. We note that the simulation of Richter et al.\n(2006a) generally produces larger b than currently observed: for systems with log NHI & 13.2, the median,\nmean, and standard deviation are 59, 69, 31 km s\u22121 for\n\nthe simulation, while they are 52, 57, 18 km s\u22121 for the\nobservations. The current S/N of the observed data limits the detection of the broader absorbers with b > 80\nkm s\u22121 , as discussed in \u00a72. We also note that the broader\nsystems (b > 80 km s\u22121 ) are likely to be more uncertain,\nespecially since they are detected in the lowest column\ndensity range (log NHI . 13.4).\nSchaye et al. (1999) and others demonstrated that the\ntemperature-density relation, which is well described by\na power law T = T0 (\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304)\u03b3\u22121 (where \u03c1\u0304 is the average density, \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 is the overdensity of the IGM), implies a lower\nenvelope to the b\u2013NHI distribution. This lower envelope\nis not clearly observed in Fig. 5. We further explore this\nby considering the numerical cosmological simulations of\nthe low-redshift Ly\u03b1 forest that predict that the temperature T4 = T /(104 K) is a power law of the overdensity\n\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304, with\n\nT4 \u2248 0.5\n\n\u0012 \u00130.6\n\u03c1\n,\n\u03c1\u0304\n\n(1)\n\nfor the coolest systems at any given density. The overdensity is connected to the H I column density through\n\n\f10\n\nLehner et al.\n\nFig. 6.- Left: Line width versus H I column density for the BLAs (b > 40 km s\u22121 ) along the seven sightlines. Only data with less\nthan 40% errors in b and NHI are considered. Right: Line width versus H I column density for the high-quality sample of BLAs simulated\nby Richter et al. (2006a). The dashed vertical lines highlight the column density range [13.1,13.5] dex where the broadest absorbers with\nb > 80 km s\u22121 are detected in the observational sample.\n\n(Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999),\n\u03c1\n\u2248 20\n\u03c1\u0304\n\n\u0012\n\nNHI\n14\n10 cm\u22122\n\n\u00130.7\n\n10\u22120.4z .\n\nIf we combine these two equations, we have:\n\u00130.42\n\u0012\nNHI\n10\u22120.24z .\nT4 \u2248 3\n1014 cm\u22122\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThe pure\nthermal Doppler broadening for H is bth =\n\u221a\n0.129 T , so for photoionized hydrogen absorbers we can\nwrite\n\u0012\n\u00130.21\nNHI\nbth \u2248 22\n10\u22120.12z km s\u22121 .\n(4)\n1014 cm\u22122\nThis latter relation is shown in Fig 5 with the dotted\nline where we set z = 0.2, which is about the mean and\nmedian z in our sample. Since the \u03c1\u2013T fit to photoionized absorbers is for the coolest systems, this relation\nshould provide a lower envelope to the b\u2013NHI distribution. The lower envelope to the observed b\u2013NHI distribution roughly agrees with the numerical simulations, at\nleast as long as log NHI . 14.2. But the low redshift\nsample does not provide yet as sharp a lower envelope to\nthe b\u2013NHI distribution as high redshift samples do (see\nfor example Kirkman & Tytler 1997; Kim et al. 2002a)\nbecause there are still too few systems at the completeness level. In Fig. 5, we show with the dot-dashed line\nthe relation bmin = 20 + 4 log[NHI /(1014 cm\u22122 )] km s\u22121\nfound by Kirkman & Tytler (1997) at z\u0304 = 2.7 and\nwith the long dashed line the relation log bmin = 1.3 +\n0.090 log[NHI /(1014 cm\u22122 )] km s\u22121 found by Kim et al.\n(2002b) at z\u0304 = 2.1 (smoothed power-law fit). These\npower laws provide a good approximation to the observed\nlower envelope of b at high redshift. At low redshift at\nlog NHI & 13.2, a few absorbers lie below these fits, especially at log NHI & 15. For systems with log NHI . 15\nit is not clear if the lower b cutoff evolves with redshift.\n\nFinally, following Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001), if we compare\nthe median in the various intervals with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121\n(red curve in Fig. 5) and bth defined in Eq. 4, we find\nthat bth \u223c (0.6 \u2212 0.7)bobs for a typical absorber with\nlog NHI . 14.2. Therefore, the contribution from thermal broadening is substantial for the low redshift NLAs.\nHowever, if the some BLAs actually trace cool photoionized gas, the non-thermal broadening will be dominant\nin these absorbers.\n3.3. Ly\u03b1 Line Density\n\nThis sample provides the first opportunity to investigate the relative number of systems as a function of the\nDoppler parameter in the low-z IGM. In Table 4, we summarize dN /dz for each sightline and for the combined\nsample where our sub-samples have either b \u2264 40 km s\u22121\nor b \u2264 150 km s\u22121 . For both b-samples, we choose three\ndifferent column density ranges: (a) [13.2, 14.0] dex, (b)\n[13.2, 16.5] dex and (c) [13.64, 16.5] dex. The lower limit\nof samples (a) and (b) corresponds to our threshold of\ncompleteness. The largest observed column density in\nour sample is about 1016.5 cm\u22122 . Hence sample (b) corresponds to the combined sample with W & 90 m\u00c5,\nwhile sample (a) only covers the weaker Ly\u03b1 lines which\nmay evolve differently than the stronger lines since the\nweaker lines may arise from tenuous gas in the IGM while\nthe stronger lines may mostly trace the gas in the outskirts of galaxies. The threshold of sample (c) was chosen to be comparable to the equivalent width threshold\nof 0.24 \u00c5 from the HST QSO absorption line key project\n(Weymann et al. 1998).

Errors are from Poisson statistics.\nThe number between parentheses in the row showing the\nmean corresponds to the standard deviation around the\nmean for the different lines of sight.\n\ncause the broader absorbers and uncertain absorbers are\nnot included in our sample. Indeed, the estimates of\nWeymann et al. (1998) and Impey et al. (1999) appear\nintermediate between our two b samples. Penton et al.\n(2004) found dN /dz = 25 \u00b1 (4, 5) for a sample with\nz < 0.069 which overlaps with our estimate within the 1\u03c3\ndispersion, which implies little or no evolution of dN /dz\nat z . 0.4 for the strong H I absorbers. For b \u2264 150\nkm s\u22121 , the value of dN /dz is about 1.3 times larger\nthan for the NLAs. We find that the broad Ly\u03b1 lines\nwith 40 < b \u2264 150 km s\u22121 have dN (BLA)/dz \u2248 9, implying that for the stronger lines of the Ly\u03b1 forest, the\nnumber of BLAs per unit redshift may be important.\nComparison of samples (a) and (b) shows that the\n\nweak systems are far more frequent than the strong systems. For these samples, we note that dN /dz is systematically smaller toward H 1821+643 and HE 0226\u20134110\nthan dN /dz toward the other sightlines for both b subsamples. dN /dz toward PG 1116+215 and PKS 0405\u2013\n123 is intermediate for the NLAs. The 3 other lines of\nsight have similar dN /dz. These trends do not appear\nrelated to the S/N of the data since the S/N is the highest\ntoward H 1821+643 and comparatively low for HE 0226\u2013\n4110. The redshift paths do not seem to explain all the\ndifferences. For example, while the redshift paths are\ncomparable between HE 0226\u20134110 and PG 1259+593,\n\u2206z is significantly smaller toward PG 1116+215. dN /dz\nis very similar for either column density range toward\nthe sightlines that cover small and large redshift paths,\nimplying no redshift evolution of dN /dz between z > 0.\nand z . 0.4. Therefore, some of the observed variation\nin dN /dz must be cosmic variance between sightlines.\nWe explore the effect of the S/N on the dN (BLA)/dz\nestimate in Table 5 by considering data with\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2. As expected, the spectra with the highest S/N are less affected by these cutoffs\nthan the spectra with the lowest S/N. Decreasing the error thresholds has an effect mostly on the weak systems\n(log NHI . 13.40). Toward PG 0953+415, the four BLAs\nhave 13.2 < log NHI \u2264 13.40 and 0.23 \u2264 \u03c3b /b \u2264 0.30,\nwhich explains why there is no BLA at the threshold\n\u03c3b /b \u2264 0.2. Although the HS 0624+6207 spectrum has\nseveral weak BLAs, only if \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N < 0.15 is applied\ndo we observe a significant drop in dN (BLA)/dz by a factor 2.5. On average, there is a decrease in dN (BLA)/dz\nby a factor \u223c1.4 between the cutoff at 0.4 and 0.2. If\nonly BLAs with 40 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 are considered,\ndN (BLA)/dz = 28, 25, 20 for \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4, 0.3, 0.2,\nrespectively. These estimates are in agreement with\nthose of Richter et al. (2006b) (see also \u00a74.2). The BLA\ndensity is about twice smaller than dN (NLA)/dz for\nsamples (a) and (b).\nFinally, we summarize in Fig. 7 the frequency of the\nLy\u03b1 absorbers with various b-values in the low redshift\nuniverse. In this figure, dN /dz represents the mean of\nthe number density of H I absorbers obtained toward\neach line of sight in four intervals of b ([0, 20], [20, 40],\n[40, 60], [60, 80] km s\u22121 ) using data with \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264\n0.4 and log NHI \u2265 13.2. The vertical error bars assume\nPoissonian errors. The mean dN /dz is shown at the\nmean b-value of each b-interval sample. The horizontal\nbars show the b-intervals delimited by the minimum and\nmaximum b-values of each b-interval sample.

Very narrow Ly\u03b1 absorbers with b < 20 km s\u22121 are rare, and we\nnote that in the [0, 20] km s\u22121 interval, most of the absorbers have b & 15 km s\u22121 . The paucity of very narrow\nabsorbers with log NHI \u2265 13.2 is real since the resolution\nof STIS E140M (binst \u223c 4 km s\u22121 ) allows to fully resolve\nabsorbers with b & 5 km s\u22121 . The broad absorbers are\nmore frequent in the b = [40, 60] km s\u22121 range: there\nare about 3.5 times more absorbers in [40, 60] km s\u22121\ninterval than in the b = [60, 80] km s\u22121 interval. Ly\u03b1 absorbers are therefore more frequent for low column densities (log N (H I) . 14) and for b-values between 20 and\n40 km s\u22121 .\n4. EVOLUTION OF THE DOPPLER PARAMETER\n4.1. Higher Redshift Samples\nRecently, the analysis of the Ly\u03b1 absorbers in the\nredshift range 0.5 < z < 2.0 from Janknecht et al.\n(2006) has become available at the Centre de Donn\u00e9es\nde Strasbourg (CDS). Their data that sample the mid-z\nIGM at 0.5 < z . 1.5 were obtained with HST/STIS\nE230M: PG 1634+706 (z = 0.534\u20131.295), PKS 0232\u201304\n\n(z = 0.876\u20131.419), PG 1630+377 (z = 0.875\u20131.451),\nPG 0117+213 (z = 0.875\u20131.475), HE 0515\u20134414 (z =\n0.874\u20131.475) and HS 0747+4259 (z = 0.760\u20131.443). The\nredshifts between parentheses indicate the redshift interval probed by the observations. The spectral resolution of E230M data (R \u223c 30000) is lower than that\nof the low-z sample obtained with the E140M grating\n(R \u223c 44000). The S/N of the mid-z sample is comparable to the lowest S/N of the low-z sample, except\nfor PG 1634+706, which has a S/N per resolution element of 5\u201340. The high redshift sample (z > 1.5) consists of data obtained with VLT/UVES (R \u223c 40000):\nHE 0515\u20134414 (1.515\u20131.682), HE 0141\u20133932 (z = 1.518\u2013\n1.784), HE 2225\u20132258 (z = 1.515\u20131.861), and HE 0429\u2013\n4901 (z = 1.662\u20131.910). The S/N is typically higher than\n30\u201340, except for HE 0429\u20134901, which is about 15. The\nspectrum of HS 0747+4259 (z = 1.562\u20131.866) was also\nobtained with Keck/HIRES (R \u223c 50000) with a S/N in\nthe range of 6\u201324.\nFor the high redshift sample, we also consider the\nspectra of QSOs at z > 1.5 presented by Kim et al.\n(2002a). Their profile fitting results are available at the\nCDS. These data were obtained with the VLT/UVES\nat resolution of R \u223c 45000 and typical S/N \u2243 40\u201350.\nThe QSOs considered are: HE 0515\u20134414 (z = 1.53\u2013\n1.69), Q 1101\u2013264 (z = 1.66\u20132.08), J 2233\u2013606 (z = 1.80\u2013\n2.20), HE 1122-1648 (z = 1.88\u20132.37), HE 2217\u20132818 (z =\n1.89\u20132.37), HE 1347\u20132457 (z = 2.09\u20132.57), Q 0302\u2013003\n(z = 2.96\u20133.24), Q 0055\u2013269 (z = 2.99\u20133.60). Note\nthat the HE 0515\u20134414 VLT spectrum in Janknecht et al.\n(2006) has a different wavelength coverage and exposure\ntime than the HE 0515\u20134414 VLT spectrum presented\nby Kim et al. (2002a). We finally consider the H I parameters measured toward HS 1946+7658 (z = 2.43\u2013\n3.05) by Kirkman & Tytler (1997). The spectrum of\nHS 1946+7658 was obtained with Keck/HIRES. The S/N\nper resolution element varies from about 30 to 200 and\nthe spectral resolution is similar to UVES. The spectral\nresolution of the high redshift sample is similar to the low\nredshift sample, but the S/N is generally much higher in\nthe z > 1.5 sample than in the low or mid z samples\n4.2. Conditions for Comparing Various Samples\n\nThe definition of a BLA that was followed in recent\npapers presented by our group is an absorber that can\nbe fitted with a single Gaussian component with b > 40\nkm s\u22121 and for which the reduced-\u03c72 does not improve\nstatistically by adding more components in the model.\nLow S/N data can have, however, treacherous effects that\ncan mask a BLA or confuse narrow multi-absorbers with\na BLA (see Figure 2 in Richter et al. 2006b). To overcome the effects of noise, the sample of BLAs defined\nby Richter et al. (2006b) has also to satisfy the following rules: (i) the line does not show any asymmetry, (ii)\nthe line is not blended, (iii) there is no evidence of multiple components in the profile; (iv) the S/N must be\nhigh enough (i.e. log(NHI /b) & log[3 \u00d7 1012 /(S/N)] &\n11.3, where NHI and b are in cm\u22122 and km s\u22121 , respectively). For the low redshift sample presented here,\nthe BLAs strictly follow criteria (iv) when the condition \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 is set.. Following these rules,\nRichter et al. (2006b) found dN (BLA)/dz = 22 \u00b1 5 for\ntheir secure detections (53 for the entire candidate sam-\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\nple). Within 1\u03c3, our BLA number density estimate\noverlaps with the result of Richter et al. (2006b) when\nthe cutoff \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 is applied to our sample.\nTherefore, this shows that by applying an error cutoff\nwithout scrutinizing each profile for the conditions listed\nabove, we find a similar average dN (BLA)/dz. This\nis crucial because for a comparison with other samples\nat higher z, we can not examine each absorber individually. For the sample presented by Janknecht et al.\n(2006), no spectra or fits are shown. Kim et al. (2002a)\nand Kirkman & Tytler (1997) present their spectra and\nfits, but over too broad wavelength ranges to study in\ndetail the conditions listed above. Furthermore, as z\nincreases absorbers are more often blended due to the\nhigher redshift line density, so we can not reject the\nblended systems, otherwise we would introduce a strong\nbias in the comparison. At high, mid, and low redshift,\nthe \u03c72 of the profile fit governs the number of components allowed in the model of an absorber; therefore a\nsimilar methodology was applied in each sample, allowing a direct comparison of the various measurements. We\napply the same cutoff \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 to the z > 0.5\nredshift samples to remove the uncertain profile fit results in a similar manner in each sample. Such cutoff,\nhowever, introduces a systematic effect: more BLAs will\nbe rejected in low S/N spectra (low and some mid z data)\nthan in high S/N spectra (high z data). But such systematics should underestimate the number of BLAs in\nlow S/N data, and therefore this should strengthen the\ndifferences observed at low z compared to the higher z\nsamples.\nFor our comparison, we also consider only absorbers\nwith log NHI \u2265 13.2, the completeness level of the low\nredshift sample, which also corresponds to about the\ncompleteness of the lowest S/N spectra of the mid-z sample. If the S/N of the high redshift spectra is solely\nconsidered, absorbers with log NHI \u2265 13.2 would be far\nabove the completeness level of the high redshift sample, which is log NHI & 12.5 for the data presented by\nKim et al. (2002a) and Kirkman & Tytler (1997). However, line blending and blanketing reduce the completeness threshold, especially at z & 2.5 (Kirkman & Tytler\n1997; Lu et al. 1996). At z \u223c 4, Lu et al. (1996) show\nusing simulated spectra that line blanketing was not\nimportant as long as log NHI & 13.5, while at z \u223c\n2.7, Kirkman & Tytler (1997) show following a similar\nmethodology that their sample is likely to be complete\nat log NHI & 12.8\u201313.0. Since broad and shallow absorbers are more uncertain, considering only absorbers\nwith log NHI \u2265 13.2 also reduces the problem of creating\na higher proportion of wide lines than is really present in\nthe intrinsic distribution.\nFor our comparison, we only consider BLAs with 40 <\nb \u2264 100 km s\u22121 . The choice of b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 reduces\nthe incompleteness at the high b end of the low redshift sample. Furthermore, at z \u223c 4 (which is at higher\nredshift than any absorbers considered here), Lu et al.\n(1996) argue that absorbers with b > 100 km s\u22121 are\ncaused essentially by heavily blended forest lines since\nthey are systematically found in the high line density region of the spectrum. This effect should diminish greatly\nas z decreases. At z \u223c 2.7, Kirkman & Tytler (1997)\nhave produced simulated spectra to better understand\n\n13\n\nthe intrinsic properties of their observational data. They\nobserve a tail at high b in both the simulated and observed b distributions. In the simulated spectra, the tail\nat b > 80 km s\u22121 is only due to line blending because\ntheir simulation did not allow such broad lines. They\nfind more lines at b > 80 km s\u22121 in the observed distribution (3.6% compared to 0.5% in the simulated spectra), suggesting that many of these absorbers could be\nintrinsically broad. Refined simulations, so that simulated observations match exactly the real observations,\nwould be needed to be entirely conclusive on this point\n(Kirkman & Tytler 1997). Yet, at high z, if BLAs with\nb > 80 km s\u22121 that are in fact blended narrow lines\nwere frequent, this effect should be more important as\nz increases. We will see that this effect, if present, is\nnot statistically significant (see next two sections). By\nconsidering only absorbers with 40 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 ,\nlog NHI \u2265 13.2, and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4, we reduce significantly the risk of including spurious broad absorbers. We\nalso note that, in any samples considered, the majority\nof BLAs are actually found in the b-range 40 < b \u2264 60\nkm s\u22121 , not in the b-range b > 80 km s\u22121 .\nIn Fig. 8, we show the b\u2013NHI distribution for three\nredshift intervals, z < 0.5 (top panel), 0.5 < z < 1.5\n(middle panel), and 1.5 < z . 3.6 (bottom panel). Only\nabsorbers that satisfy the conditions 0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 ,\nlog NHI \u2265 13.2, \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 are shown in the figure. At z > 0.5, there are many weak systems with\nb < 40 km s\u22121 , which darkens part of the middle and\nbottom panels. At z < 0.5, there are very few absorbers\nwith b & 40 km s\u22121 and log NHI > 14, and none of them\nhave b > 50 km s\u22121 . This contrasts remarkably with\nwhat is observed at higher redshifts: many absorbers\nat z > 0.5 have b > 40 km s\u22121 and log NHI \u2265 14.0.\nThis effect must be due to strong, saturated Ly\u03b1 lines\nfor which the errors for b and log NHI are far too optimistic. At z < 0.5, saturation can be dealt with because higher Lyman series lines are systematically used\nin the profile fitting, reducing the possibility of nonuniqueness in the profile fitting solution and of finding\nunrealistic large b-values for strong lines. At z > 0.5,\nLy\u03b1 is generally the only transition available, although\nwe note Kim et al. (2002a) analyzed the Ly\u03b2 forest at\nz < 2.5 with a small sample and their results suggested\nthat line blending and saturation are not an important\nissue. Yet, Fig. 8 shows a system with b = 97.0 \u00b1 3.8\nkm s\u22121 and log NHI = 16.44 \u00b1 0.14. This absorber is observed in the spectrum of J 2233\u2013606 at z = 1.869, and\nthe parameters that are presented here were estimated\nby Kim et al. (2002a). The spectrum of J 2233\u2013606 is\nshown in Cristiani & D'Odorico (2000) and at the wavelength corresponding to this absorber, there is a strong,\nsaturated line that Kim et al. (2002a) model with a single component. D'Odorico & Petitjean (2001) actually\nfound that this absorber has \u223c11\u201316 components using\nhigher Lyman series lines and metal lines. While this example is extreme, most of the absorbers with log NHI >\n14 and b > 40 km s\u22121 are likely to be strong saturated\nLy\u03b1 lines at z > 0.5. Fig. 1 in Kirkman & Tytler (1997),\nwhich shows the whole HS 1946+7658 spectrum with the\nvalues of log NHI , b, corroborates this conclusion. The\nstrong, saturated Ly\u03b1 lines are unlikely to probe a single\n\n\f14\n\nLehner et al.\n\nFig. 8.- Left panel: Line width versus H I column density for the Ly\u03b1 absorbers for 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 16.5 and 0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121\nin different redshift intervals indicated in the upper-right corner. Only data with less than 40% errors in b and NHI are considered. The\nsymbols have the following meaning: data represented by circles were estimated from the low redshift sample (see Table 1 for the references);\ndata represented by stars are from the sample of Janknecht et al. (2006); data represented by triangles are from the sample of Kim et al.\n(2002a); data represented by squares are from the sample of Kirkman & Tytler (1997). Right panel: Same as the left-hand side, but only\nfor absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0\n\nbroad line, but are likely composed of several unresolved\ncomponents. Therefore, for our comparison, we will consider absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0. This sample\nis summarized in the right-hand side of Fig. 8.\nAs we have just illustrated, the Voigt profile fitting\nmethod adopted for deriving z, b, NHI may not be unique,\nespecially for highly blended regions, strong lines, and\nlow S/N spectra. We believe that some of this effect is\nreduced by considering absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264\n14.0, b < 100 km s\u22121 , and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4. At low\nz, line blending and strong lines are not a major issue\nbecause often higher Lyman series lines can be used.\nFuthermore, several persons analyzed these data independently, and other methods (curve-of-growth and/or\noptical depth method) were also used for the low-z sample, yielding consistent results (see the references given in\nTable 1), although the Appendix highlights some differences between various groups. Even in this latter case,\nthere is roughly a 1\u03c3 consistency between the various\nresults for absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0. At\nz \u223c 2.7, Kirkman & Tytler (1997) show that profile fitting may not provide a unique solution even in very high\nS/N data. Yet, their comparison with simulated spectra\nshow that the intrinsic distribution of b is very similar\nto the observed b distribution. Therefore, in a statistical\n\nsense, the observed b distribution at high z can be used\nfor our comparison. We also note that three different research groups have worked on the absorbers at z & 1.5\npresented here, with the spectra obtained from different\ntelescopes with different S/N, and we did not find any\nmajor differences between their results, at least within\nthe conditions listed above.\nContinuum placement may also be a problem for\nfinding or defining a BLA. At low z, BLAs may be\nconfused with continuum undulations. With our constraints, most of these ill-defined BLAs are rejected (see\nalso Richter et al. 2006b). We believe that this conclusion should apply to the mid-z sample, but since\nJanknecht et al. (2006) did not present any of the spectra they analyze, we treat this sample with more caution\n(see also below). At z > 1.5, the continuum is more difficult because each order must be fitted with a high order\nLegendre polynomial, and during the Voigt profile fitting\nprocess, the continuum level is often adjusted to give an\noptimum fit between the data and the calculated Voigt\nmodel. Furthermore, as z increases the continuum placement becomes more difficult because the line density increases, and therefore the line blending and blanketing\neffects increase. High order polynomials and adjusted\ncontinua can therefore mask broad and shallow BLAs.\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\nHowever, such effects may be counterbalanced by a possible spurious increase of BLAs caused by the same line\nblending and blanketing effects (see above). The high\nS/N of the data at high redshifts and considering only\nthe absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0 and b \u2264 100\nkm s\u22121 reduce greatly the risk of losing many BLAs because of the line blending and blanketing at high z. The\nproblem of not finding BLAs is potentially more important in the highest z spectra, but we do not notice significant differences between z \u223c 2 and z > 3. We also note\nabove that simulated spectra show that line blanketing\nwas not important at log NHI & 13.2. Therefore, for the\nsamples considered here using the limits log NHI \u2265 13.2\nand b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 , they must almost be complete. Ultimately, one would like to produce simulated spectra of\nvarious z with realistic inputs to fully consider the impacts of S/N, continuum placement, and line blending\nand blanketing on finding BLAs and deriving their intrinsic properties.\nThe redshift range z = 0.5\u20131.5 is more problematic\nthan the other redshift ranges because most of the data\nhave low S/N, all have lower resolution than the higher\nor lower redshift spectra, and no spectra or fits were presented by Janknecht et al. (2006) making it more difficult to assess some of the issues discussed above. Ly\u03b2\nlines are only available for about half the wavelength\ncoverage of this redshift range and lower spectral resolution and S/N of these data further worsen the problems\nof saturation and non-uniqueness in the profile fitting\nresults. Setting the conditions 0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 ,\n13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0, and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 make\nthis sample stronger, but we nonetheless treat the results from this sample with caution. We will consider\ntwo sub-samples for the estimate of the redshift density\nbased on the Janknecht et al. (2006) sample (see \u00a74.4):\none with all their data, and one with only their highest\nS/N data (i.e. PG 1634+706, HE 0515\u20134144, HE 0141\u2013\n3932, HE 2225\u20132258). Among the high S/N data in the\nmid-z sample are E230M spectra of PG 1634+706 and\nHE 0515\u20134144.\nFor the reasons aforementioned, with the conditions\n0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 , 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0, and\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4, we greatly reduce some pitfalls in\ncomparing data analyzed by various groups, with different S/N, obtained with various instruments, with different line blending issues. A BLA is therefore defined\nhere as an absorber that is fitted with a single Gaussian\nfor which the \u03c72 does not drop significantly by adding\nmore components (this condition was adopted by the various groups who analyzed the data used here) and that\nhas 40 \u2264 b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 , 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0, and\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4. We believe that we are statistically\ncomparing the intrinsic properties of the broadening of\nH I absorbers, although we note that simulated spectra probing various z, with realistic inputs may be the\nonly way to fully understand some of the effects discussed\nabove and how these effects balance each other at various\nz.\n4.3. Comparison of the Distributions of b at Low and\n\nHigher z\nTable 6 summarizes the b-value median, mean, dispersion, and fraction of BLAs (i.e. systems with 40 < b \u2264\n\n15\n\n100 km s\u22121 ). In this table, we consider two sub-samples\nwith 0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 : (a) the entire sample, (b)\nthe higher quality sample with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0\nand errors in b and NHI less than 40%. We note that\nthe number of systems in each sample is roughly similar,\nexcept for the Kim et al. (2002a) sample, which is noticeably larger, and the 0.5 < z < 1.0 sample, which is\nsomewhat smaller. In sample (a) there appears to be an\nincrease in the median, mean, and the fraction of BLAs\nas z decreases. The same trend is observed in sample (b),\nbut the differences are better revealed, where the median\nand mean are always larger by 15\u201330% in the low redshift sample (z < 0.5) than in the high redshift sample\n(z > 1.5). For the sample (b), the fraction of BLAs at\nz . 0.4 is 1.9\u20132.4 times larger than the fraction of BLAs\nat z & 1.5. Therefore, b is larger on average at z . 1.0\nthan at z & 1.5, and the fraction of BLAs is larger at\nz < 1.5 than at z > 1.5.\nIn Figs. 9\u201312 we compare the distributions of b(H I). In\nall comparisons we restrict the observations to the higher\nquality measurements with less than 40% errors in b and\nNHI .\nIn Fig. 9, we compare the normalized number distribution of b(H I) for the low redshift sample with\nthe normalized number distribution of b(H I) for the\nJanknecht et al. (2006) sample, which is subdivided in 3\nz sub-samples. The distributions peak at about b \u223c 20\u2013\n30 km s\u22121 . Each distribution shows a tail at higher\nb. The tail in the 1.5 < z < 2.0 distribution is always weaker than in the lower z-interval distributions,\nespecially for 40 < b < 55 km s\u22121 . The tail in the\n0.5 < z < 1.0 distribution is generally stronger than\nany other z-interval distribution presented in this figure,\nwhich is possibly due to a combination of blending effects,\nlow S/N spectra, and lower resolution spectra in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.0. We note that data probing\nthe redshift ranges 0.5 < z < 1.0 and 1.0 < z < 1.5 were\nobtained with the STIS E230M grating, but the sensitivity of E230M is lower for Ly\u03b1 in the redshift range\n0.5 . z . 0.9 than 0.9 . z . 1.4. A KolmogorovSmirnov test does not reveal a significant difference between the samples z < 0.5 and 0.5 < z < 1.5 (the maximum deviation between the two cumulative distributions\nis D = 0.118 with a level of significance P = 0.104), but\nsuggests a difference between the samples z < 0.5 and\n1.5 < z < 2.0. Therefore, BLAs appear more frequent at\nz < 1.5 than at z > 1.5.\nIn Fig. 10, we compare the normalized number distribution of b(H I) for the low redshift sample with the\nnormalized number distribution of b(H I) for the high\nredshift sample (1.5 \u2264 z \u2264 3.6) from Kim et al. (2002a).\nThe left panel shows the entire sample at 1.5 \u2264 z \u2264 3.6,\nwhile the right panel shows the distribution of b in various redshift intervals for the high z sample. The peak\nof the high redshift normalized distribution in Fig. 10\nis not only shifted by \u223c \u22125 km s\u22121 with respect to the\npeak of the low redshift distribution, but also the width\nof the distribution is smaller for the high redshift sample. Moreover, the low redshift sample shows a tail of\nhigh b(H I) absorbers that is much weaker in the high\nredshift sample, showing that BLAs are more frequent at\nz < 0.5 than at z > 1.5. The right-hand side of Fig. 10\nverifies this conclusion for the various redshift intervals,\n\n\f16\n\nLehner et al.\nTABLE 6\nEvolution of b\nz < 0.5\n(this paper)\n\n0.5 < z < 1.0\n(J06)\n\n1.0 < z < 1.5\n(J06)\n\n1.5 < z < 2.0\n(J06)\n\n1.5 < z < 3.6\n(K02)\n\n2.4 < z < 3.1\n(KT97)\n\n28.0 (450)\n31.4 \u00b1 14.5\n0.204\n\n24.8 (2305)\n27.2 \u00b1 13.5\n0.131\n\n27.1 (452)\n31.2 \u00b1 16.2\n0.210\n\n0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121\nb median (mtot )\nb mean \u00b1\u03c3\nm(b > 40)/mtot\n\n30.5 (336)\n34.0 \u00b1 16.9\n0.277\n\n27.9 (263)\n32.9 \u00b1 17.8\n0.274\n\n28.3 (588)\n31.8 \u00b1 17.0\n0.240\n\n0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 and 0 < (\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N ) \u2264 0.4 and 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0\nb median (mtot )\nb mean \u00b1\u03c3\nm(b > 40)/mtot\n\n32.7 (162)\n37.4 \u00b1 16.1\n0.321\n\n31.5 (82)\n36.0 \u00b1 18.3\n0.317\n\n30.8 (209)\n35.5 \u00b1 17.3\n0.272\n\n28.2 (154)\n31.7 \u00b1 12.9\n0.169\n\n25.5 (509)\n29.2 \u00b1 11.9\n0.132\n\n27.1 (123)\n32.5 \u00b1 16.0\n0.179\n\nNote. - Median and mean values of b are listed for the different redshift intervals for the entire samples with\n0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 and the higher quality samples restricted to absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0. mtot is the\ntotal number of absorbers in the sample. m(b > 40) is the total number of absorbers with 40 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 in the\nsample.

(2006) for the weak absorbers 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0. The sample in the redshift range\nz \u2243 0.5\u20131.5 has a spectral resolution of about 10 km s\u22121 , while the\nother samples have about 7\u20138 km s\u22121 . Only data with less than\n40% errors in b and NHI are considered.\n\ni.e. BLAs appear more frequent at z < 0.5 than for any\nredshift intervals at z > 1.5. There is, however, no major difference between the various redshift intervals at\nz > 1.5. We also note that the b distribution at z > 1.5\nshows little effect of line blending as z increases since\nthere is scant evidence of a larger of fraction of BLAs at\nz & 3 than at 1.5 . z . 2.\nWe compare in Fig. 11 our low z sample to the high redshift absorbers observed toward the QSO HS 1946+7658\n(Kirkman & Tytler 1997). The median and mean are\nsomewhat intermediate between our sample and the\nKim et al. (2002a) sample (see Table 6). We slightly adjusted the redshift of the low z sample so that the low\nand high redshift samples have exactly the same number of systems (m = 130); hence the two distributions\ncan be directly compared. The peak of the high redshift distribution in Fig. 10 is again shifted by \u223c \u22125\nkm s\u22121 with respect to the peak of the low z distribu-\n\ntion. A higher number of systems with 40 < b \u2264 70\nkm s\u22121 is found in the low redshift sample. At b > 70\nkm s\u22121 the high redshift sample appears to have a larger\nnumber of systems. However, we note that the data of\nKirkman & Tytler (1997) have S/N up to 200, and as\nwe discussed in \u00a72 our sample is not complete for b > 80\nkm s\u22121 . A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a maximum\ndeviation between the two cumulative distributions of\nthe low and high redshift samples D = 0.210 with a level\nof significance P = 0.006; the null hypothesis of no difference between the two datasets is therefore rejected.\nSo far, we have ignored the effects of evolution of column density in the absorbers in our comparison. According to the numerical simulation of Dav\u00e9 et al. (1999),\nthe dynamical state of an absorber depends mainly on\nits overdensity, so that a column density range traces\nabsorbers of progressively higher overdensity as the universe expands. Therefore, according to Eq. 2, a low redshift H I absorber is physically analogous to a high redshift H I absorber not with the same column density but\nto an absorber with column density 100.4\u00d7(zhigh \u2212zlow )/0.7\ntimes higher (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999). With the average redshifts of 2.6 and 0.2 of the high redshift sample of\nKim et al. (2002a) and our sample, this corresponds to\na column density roughly 25 times higher, i.e. a sample\nwith 12.5 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.1 at low z is physically analogous to the high redshift sample with 13.9 \u2264 log NHI \u2264\n15.5. At such high column density, BLAs are likely to\ntrace in large part narrower, strong absorbers that are\nblended together (see \u00a74.2). We, nonetheless, make this\ncomparison in Fig. 12, where both samples have the same\nnumber of systems. The high redshift sample has again a\nlarger fraction of systems in the range b = [20, 40] km s\u22121\nthan the low redshift sample. The fraction of BLAs at\nlow redshift is again larger than the fraction of BLAs\nat high redshift with b > 50 km s\u22121 . This is remarkable since the low redshift sample is far from complete\nfor log NHI . 13.2 and the high redshift sample likely\noverestimates the number of true BLAs (i.e. BLAs that\nare not blends of NLAs). We again apply a KolmogorovSmirnov test on the two cumulative distributions of the\nlow and high redshift samples and find D = 0.130 with a\nlevel of significance P = 0.029; again the null hypothesis\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\n\n17\n\nFig. 10.- Left panel: Comparison of the normalized distributions of b(H I) for the low z sample of data points (black histogram) and\nfor the high redshift sample (red histogram) from Kim et al.

Higher column density systems at high redshift\nare expected to be physically analogous to the low density systems\nat low redshift in an expanding universe.

The vertical bars are Poissonian errors. The symbols have the following\nmeaning: data represented by circles are estimated from the low redshift sample (see Table 1 for the references); data represented by stars\nare estimated from the sample of Janknecht et al. (2006); data represented by triangles are estimated from the sample of Kim et al. (2002a);\ndata represented by the square are estimated from the sample of Kirkman & Tytler (1997). The left panel considers all the data with the\nconditions listed above from these various samples, while in the right panel we remove the lowest quality measurements of Janknecht et al.\n(2006) (see \u00a74.2).\n\nThe top two panels of Fig. 13 show the usual number density evolution with little or no evolution between\nredshifts 0 and \u223c1.0\u20131.6, and an evolution of dN /dz\nwith z at higher redshift (see for example Kim et al.\n2002a). At high redshift, dN /dz decreases with decreasing z (dN /dz \u221d (1 + z)\u03b3 , \u03b3 > 0) according to the expansion of the universe, which forces any initial baryon\noverdensity to thin out (e.g., Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999, and references therein). The expansion also results in a decrease\nof recombinations of the free electrons with the protons\nand thus in an additional decline in dN /dz. The break\nin dN /dz near z \u223c 1.6 (log(1+z) \u223c 0.4) is believed to be\nprimarily caused by the drop in the UV background because of the declining quasar population (Theuns et al.\n1998; Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999). In the top panels, the solid line\nshows dN /dz = (dN /dz)0 (1 + z)\u03b3 , where \u03b3 = 1.42 was\nadopted from Kim et al. (2002a) who find this value for\nthe weak absorbers with 13.1 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0. The\nvalue of (dN /dz)0 was adjusted to match the data. For\nthe entire sample (0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 ) or the sample\nrestricted to b < 40 km s\u22121 , this line represents well the\nevolution of dN /dz at z > 1, but we note that when the\nbest quality data are considered (right-hand side panel),\nthe break in the evolution appears to occur at z \u223c 1.6.\n\nThe second panels from the bottom in Fig. 13 show\nthat dN (BLA)/dz is generally similar or higher at low\nand mid redshift than between redshifts 1.6 and 2. At\nz & 2, dN (BLA)/dz increases and is larger at z > 2.5\nthan dN (BLA)/dz at z < 1.5. The Hubble expansion\nmust be the primary driver in the evolution of these\nstructures at high redshift, and despite the expansion\nthe BLA number density is comparable to dN (BLA)/dz\nat high z, which contrasts remarkably from the evolution of dN (NLA)/dz from low to high z. This difference is even more striking when we consider the ratio\nR \u2261 (dN (BLA)/dz)/(dN (NLA)/dz) (bottom panels),\nwhich is higher in the low redshift sample than in the\nhigh redshift sample. On the left-hand side diagram, at\nmid redshift there is a very large scatter in the redshift\nrange 0.9 . z . 1.2. This scatter clears up when only the\nbest quality data of the mid-z sample are considered (see\nright-hand side diagram). The distribution of R between\nredshifts \u223c1.6 to 3.5 is actually nearly flat, showing that\nthe slope controlling the evolution of dN (NLA)/dz and\ndN (BLA)/dz at z & 1.6 must be about the same, further\nstrengthening that NLAs and BLAs must follow a similar\nevolution dictated by the expansion of the universe. We\nnote that R(z > 2.5) is slightly larger than R(z \u223c 2),\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\npossibly indicating some spurious increase of BLAs possibly due to line blending and blanketing effects that are\nmore serious at z > 2.5 than at z \u223c 2. However, in\nthe view of the large scatter in the various samples, this\nresult does not appear statistically significant. The grey\ncrosses in the bottom panels show the average R over the\nredshift range depicted by the horizontal grey bar (the\nvertical grey bar assumes Poissonian errors). At z . 1.6,\nR is larger than at z > 1.6 as both the individual R and\naverage R show. R is a factor 3.2 higher at z . 0.4 than\nat z & 1.6. When only the best data of Janknecht et al.\n(2006) are considered, R at mid-redshift (0.6 . z . 1.5)\nappears similar to the value observed at low redshift.\nIf we had considered systems with b \u2264 80 km s\u22121 , the\nsame conclusions would be drawn. If we had considered\na cutoff for the NLAs of b = 50 or 60 km s\u22121 instead\nof 40 km s\u22121 , similar conclusions would also be drawn.\nIf absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 16.5 are considered,\nwe find that R(z < 0.5) \u223c 3R(z > 1.6), despite the fact\nmany BLAs at high z may actually be blends of narrower\nlines (see \u00a74.2).\n4.5. Implications\n\nWe find that (1) the distribution of b for the BLAs\nhas a distinctly more prominent high velocity tail at low\nand mid z than at high z; (2) the median and mean bvalues at low and mid z are systematically higher than at\nhigh z; and (3) the ratio (dN (BLA)/dz)/(dN (NLA)/dz)\nat low and mid z is a factor \u223c3 higher than at high z.\nThese conclusions hold for a division b = 40, 50, or 60\nkm s\u22121 between NLAs and BLAs. For the reasons discussed in \u00a74.2, we believe that these are intrinsic properties of the evolution of the physical state of the gas that\nare not caused by comparing data with different S/N and\nline blending and blanketing effects. However, simulated\nspectra probing various z, with realistic inputs would certainly help to unravel how exactly some of these issues\n(e.g., continuum placement, line blending effect, different S/N ratios) balance each other. Our results strongly\nsuggest that if the broadening is mostly thermal, a larger\nfraction of the low z universe is hotter than the high z\nuniverse, and if the broadening is mostly non-thermal,\nthe low z universe is more kinematically disturbed than\nthe high z universe. It is likely that both possibilities are\ntrue.\n5. THE DIFFERENTIAL COLUMN DENSITY\nDISTRIBUTION FUNCTION\n\nThe differential column density distribution f (NHI ) is\ndefined such that f (NHI , X)dXdNHI is the number of absorption systems with column density between NHI and\nNHI + dNHI and redshift path between X and X + dX\n(e.g., Tytler 1987),\nf (NHI )dNHI dX =\n\nm\ndNHI dX ,\n\u2206NHI \u03a3\u2206X\n\n(5)\n\nwhere m is the observed number of absorption systems\nin a column density range \u2206NHI centered on NHI obtained from our sample of 7 QSOs with a total absorption distance coverage \u03a3\u2206X = 2.404 (see \u00a72).\nEmpirically, it has been shown that at low and high\nredshift, f (NHI ) is well fitted by a single power law\n(e.g., Tytler 1987; Petitjean et al. 1993; Hu et al. 1995;\n\n19\n\nFig. 14.- The differential density distribution (f (NHI )) without\nan incompleteness correction is plotted against log NHI . Only H I\nabsorbers with b(H I) \u2264 40 km s\u22121 and errors less than 40% in\nb and NHI are considered. The data are binned only for purpose\nof presentation. The solid line is a maximum-likelihood fit to the\n\u2212\u03b2\ndata (f (NHI ) = CHI NHI\n) with the slope \u03b2 = 1.76 for H I column\ndensity systems between 13.2 and 16.5 dex. The dotted and dashed\nlines are maximum-likelihood fit to the data for 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264\n14.4 and 14.4 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 16.5, respectively (see Table 7 and \u00a75\nfor more details).\n\nLu et al. 1996; Kim et al. 2002a; Penton et al. 2000,\n2004; Dav\u00e9 & Tripp 2001):\n\u2212\u03b2\nf (NHI )dNHI dX = CHI NHI\ndNHI dX .\n\n(6)\n\nIn Table 7, we show the results from the maximumlikelihood estimate of the parameters for the slope \u03b2\nand the normalization constant where CHI \u2261 mtot (1 \u2212\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2)/[Nmax\n(1 \u2212 (Nmin /Nmax )1\u2212\u03b2 )] where mtot is the total number of absorbers in the column density range\n[Nmin , Nmax ]. We separate our sample into absorbers\nwith b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 and b \u2264 150 km s\u22121 . For both\nb-samples we also choose three different column density ranges: (a) [13.2, 16.5] dex, (b) [13.2, 14.4] dex and\n(c) [14.4, 16.5] dex. The lower limit of sample (a) and\n(b) corresponds to our threshold of completeness. The\nlargest observed column density in our sample is \u223c1016.5\ncm\u22122 . Hence sample (a) corresponds to the whole sample with W & 90 m\u00c5, while sample (b) only covers the\nweak Ly\u03b1 systems, and (c) the strong Ly\u03b1 systems. The\ncut at 14.4 was chosen because the sample analyzed by\nPenton et al. (2004) suggested a change of slope near this\nvalue (see below). Note that for each sample, we only\nconsider absorbers with \u03c3b /b \u2264 0.4 and \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4.\nIn Fig. 14, we show the column density differential\ndistribution of the identified absorbers for the combined\nsample with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 and the maximum-likelihood\nfits to the data. The fit to the sample with b \u2264 150\nkm s\u22121 implies a general increase of \u03b2 (see Table 7) for\nthe various column density intervals. For sample (a),\nif we vary log Nmin from 13.2 to 13.4, the results from\nthe maximum-likelihood fit essentially do not change. If\nlog Nmin < 13.1, \u03b2 decreases rapidly since our sample is\nnot complete anymore. If Nmax is reduced, \u03b2 will increase as sample (b) shows. For sample (b) with either\nb \u2264 40 km s\u22121 or b < 150 km s\u22121 if log Nmin increases by\nup to 0.4 and/or log Nmax varies by \u00b11.0\n0.5 dex, the results\ndo not statistically change. However, for sample (c), the\n\n\f20\n\nLehner et al.\nTABLE 7\nThe Power Law Fit to the Distribution\n\u2212\u03b2\nFunction f (NHI ) = CHI NHI\n[log Nmin , log Nmax ]\n\n\u03b2\n\nlog CHI\n\nb \u2264 40 km s\u22121\n[13.2, 16.5]\n[13.2, 14.4]\n[14.4, 16.5]\n\n1.76 \u00b1 0.06\n1.83 \u00b1 0.06\n1.52 \u00b1 0.10\n\n12.1\n13.0\n8.4\n\nb \u2264 150 km s\u22121\n[13.2, 16.5]\n[13.2, 14.4]\n[14.4, 16.5]\n\n1.84 \u00b1 0.06\n1.92 \u00b1 0.05\n1.61 \u00b1 0.11\n\n13.3\n14.4\n9.9\n\nNote. - Only data with \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 are\nincluded in the various samples (for more details,\nsee \u00a75).\n\nresults are more uncertain. While \u03b2 appears to flatten at\nlarger column densities, there are too few absorbers with\nlarge H I column density to have a full understanding\nof the possible change in the slope. In particular, it is\nnot clear from our sample where the break in the slope\noccurs since for log Nmin \u2248 14.4 \u00b1 0.5 dex, \u03b2 is \u223c1.5. At\nthe 2\u03c3 level, \u03b2 from sample (c) is essentially the same as\nfor sample (a) and (b).\nWith GHRS and STIS grating moderate spectral resolution observations, Penton et al. (2004) found at z . 0.1\n\u03b2 = 1.65 \u00b1 0.07 for 12.3 \u2264 log N (H I) \u2264 14.5 and\n\u03b2 = 1.30 \u00b1 0.30 at log N (H I) > 14.5 with few data\npoints. In their work, N (H I) was obtained from the\nequivalent width assuming b = 25 km s\u22121 . Their results\nare consistent with the Key Project data presented by\nWeymann et al. (1998) and our results. Dav\u00e9 & Tripp\n(2001) derived \u03b2 = 2.04 \u00b1 0.23 for 13 . log N (H I) . 14.\nThey used STIS E140M spectra of two QSOs and were\nable to derive b and N independently using an automated\nVoigt profile fitting software but not allowing for BLAs.\nWithin 1\u03c3, our results are the same.\nAt z & 1.5, several studies using high resolution spectra obtained with the Keck and the VLT have shown\nthat \u03b2 \u2248 1.5 for H I column density ranging from a\nfew times 1012 cm\u22122 up to a few times 1020 cm\u22122 (e.g.,\nTytler 1987; Hu et al. 1995; Lu et al. 1996), although\nthere may be some deviation from a single power law at\nlog N (H I) > 14 (Petitjean et al. 1993; Kim et al. 1997,\n2002a). There is also some suggestion that for a given\nH I interval, \u03b2 increases as z decreases, but this is statistically uncertain at z > 2 (Kim et al. 2002a). If we\ncompare our results to Kim et al. (2002a), we find an increase of \u03b2 as z decreases in the column density interval\n13.2 to 14.4 dex or 13.2 to 16.5 dex, but not in the column density interval 14.4 to 16.5 dex, although in this\nrange the number of data points is too small to draw any\nfirm conclusion. Finally, the analysis of Janknecht et al.\n(2006) at 0.5 < z < 2.0 shows that \u03b2 is intermediate between \u03b2 at z < 0.5 and \u03b2 at z > 2. Therefore, it appears\nthat the column density distribution steepens with decreasing z in the column density range 13.2 to 16.5 dex.\nA redshift dependence was found in the numerical results\npresented by Theuns et al. (1998), but the observed rate\nof evolution of \u03b2 appears to be smaller than their models\nsuggest.\n\n6. THE BARYON DENSITY OF THE IGM\n6.1. Narrow Ly\u03b1 Absorption Lines\n\nTo estimate the baryon content of the photoionized\nLy\u03b1 forest at low z we follow the method presented by\nSchaye (2001). The mean gas density relative to the critical density can be obtained from the H I density distribution function:\nZ\nnH\n\u03bc H m H H0\nf (NHI )dNHI\n(7)\nNHI\n\u03a9(NLA) =\n\u03c1c c\nnHI\nwhere mH = 1.673\u00d710\u221224 g is the atomic mass of hydrogen, \u03bcH = 1.3 corrects for the presence of helium, H0 =\n100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03c1c = 3H02 /(8\u03c0G) = 1.06 \u00d7 10\u221229\ng cm\u22123 is the current critical density, nH and nHI the\ndensity of the total hydrogen and neutral hydrogen, respectively, NHI the neutral hydrogen column density, and\nf (NHI ) the differential density distribution function discussed in \u00a75. Assuming that the gas is isothermal and\nphotoionized, the previous equation can be simplified to,\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\nfg\n1/3\n\u03a9(NLA) \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 h\u22121 \u039312 T40.59\n(8)\n0.16\nZ Nmax\n1/3\nNHI f (NHI )dNHI\nNmin\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere h \u2261 H0 /(100 km s Mpc\u22121 ), \u039312 is the H I photoionization rate in units of 10\u221212 s\u22121 , T4 is the IGM\ntemperature in units of 104 K, and fg is the fraction of\nmass in gas in which stars and molecules do not contribute. Schaye (2001) states that in cold, collapsed\nclumps, fg \u2248 1, but on the scales of interest here fg\nis close to the ratio of the total baryon density to the\nmatter density, which according to Spergel et al. (2003)\nis 0.16. We therefore set fg = 0.16. We use \u039312 = 0.05\nfrom Haardt & Madau (1996) for our average redshift\nz\u0304 = 0.19. This value of \u039312 is consistent with the value\nderived by Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001) at z\u0304 = 0.17. The typical temperature of the IGM is not well defined in the\ncurrent simulations of the low redshift universe. Schaye\n(2001) noted a good agreement between his estimate of\nT4 and the Dav\u00e9 et al. (1999) estimate, we therefore use\nEq. 3 for estimating T4 . But as these authors noted there\nis a very large scatter in the T \u2013\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 relation at z \u223c 0\nproducing uncertainty in the baryon determination from\nEq. 8 because of temperature variations. Note for our\n4/3\u2212\u03b2\ncalculation, we set z = z\u0304. Because \u03a9(NLA) \u221d NHI\nwith \u03b2 > 4/3, the low column density systems dominate\n\u03a9(NLA), therefore we will set the temperature from Nmin\nin Eq. 8. Furthermore since Nmin dominates the solution\nof Eq. 8, using this equation is dependent on the data\nquality of the current sample. We therefore emphasize\nthat we only derive the contributions of the denser parts\nof the photoionized Ly\u03b1 forest.\nTo estimate the baryon content of the photoionized regions, we only use H I absorbers with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 .\nBroader systems are here assumed to be principally collisionally ionized. For the interval of H I column density 1013.2 \u20131016.5 cm\u22122 , using the best fit parameters of\nf (NHI ) listed in Table 7 for this range of column densities\nand with (\u039312 , T4 , fg , h) = (0.05, 1.2, 0.16, 0.7), we find\n\u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b \u2243 0.19 for absorbers with log NHI \u2265 13.2,\nwhere \u03a9b = 0.044 is the ratio of the total baryon density\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\nto the critical density (Spergel et al. 2003; Burles et al.\n2001; O'Meara et al. 2001). If we assume that the\npower law described in \u00a75 fits the data extending to\nthe lower observed column density (12.42 dex), we\nfind \u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b = 0.29 for the column density range\n[12.4, 16.5] with (\u039312 , T4 , fg , h) = (0.05, 0.6, 0.16, 0.7).\nSuch an assumption is not unrealistic since, in high\nredshift spectra, Lu et al. (1996) and Kirkman & Tytler\n(1997) show using their simulation results that weak absorbers (down to 12.1\u201312.5 dex) follow the same column\ndensity distribution as the stronger absorbers. Assuming \u03b2 = 1.76 (see Table 7) and Eq. 3, the dependence\nbetween \u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b and Nmin can be approximated by\n\u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b \u2243 0.2 (Nmin/[1013.2 cm\u22122 ])\u22120.18 .\nWith the available data, there is no indication of subcomponent structure in the broad Ly\u03b1 absorption lines.\nHowever, broadening mechanisms other than thermal\nmay also be important. If this is the case, the thermal\nbroadening could decrease significantly for the broad Ly\u03b1\nabsorption lines, implying that many of those lines would\narise in the photoionized IGM, not the WHIM. If the\ncomplete sample with log NHI = [13.2, 16.5] and b \u2264 150\nkm s\u22121 is considered, \u03a9(b < 150km s\u22121 )/\u03a9b & 0.23 for\n(\u039312 , T4 , fg , h) = (0.05, 1.2, 0.16, 0.7). If the sample with\nlog NHI = [12.4, 16.5] and b \u2264 150 km s\u22121 is considered, \u03a9(b < 150km s\u22121 )/\u03a9b = 0.40 for (\u039312 , T4 , fg , h) =\n(0.05, 0.6, 0.16, 0.7). Therefore, if the BLAs are tracing\nphotoionized gas, the estimate of \u03a9 would increase by a\nfactor \u223c1.3. These BLAs would not then contribute to\nthe baryon budget in the BLAs determined in \u00a76.2.\nTo estimate a reliable error on \u03a9(NLA) remains a difficult task with our current knowledge. The estimate\nof \u03a9(NLA) is model dependent since the representative\ntemperature of the IGM is not well known. More numerical simulations of the low redshift IGM spanning a wider\nrange of parameters and using the results from the current sample may tighten \u0393 and T . If T changes by 20%,\n\u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b can change by about 10\u201315%; if \u0393 changes\nby 20%, \u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b can change by about 10%. The \u03a9\nestimate is also very sensitive to the slope \u03b2: a change\nof \u03b2 by \u00b10.005 can introduce a change in \u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b\nby about \u22134%. Furthermore the low column density\nabsorbers dominate the baryon fraction and the low column density cutoff, Nmin , is unknown. Therefore, while\nthe exact baryon content is uncertain in the photoionized IGM, it is clear that the photoionized Ly\u03b1 forest is\na large reservoir of baryons. The baryon fraction in the\ndiffuse photoionized phase traced by (narrow) Ly\u03b1 absorbers predicted by cosmological models in the low redshift universe varies by a factor 2 (\u223c20\u201340%) among the\nvarious simulations (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001), in general agreement with our results. We note that Penton et al. (2004)\nderived \u03a9(Ly\u03b1)/\u03a9b = 0.29 \u00b1 0.04 for the photoionized\nphase in the column density range [12.5,17.5] dex.7 In\nview of our discussion on the various uncertainties, we\nbelieve that their error estimate appears optimistic.\n6.2. Broad Ly\u03b1 Absorption Lines\n7 It is unclear which parameters Penton et al. (2004) used with\nthe Schaye (2001) method (if we set the parameters to those given\nby Penton et al., i.e. (\u039312 , T4 , fg , h) = (0.03, 0.5, 0.16, 0.7) we found\nthat the values in their Table 4 (Schaye column) are a factor \u223c3\ntoo high).\n\n21\n\nBaryons also reside in the WHIM, a shock-heated intergalactic gas with temperatures in the range 105 to 107 K.\nCosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that\nthe WHIM may contain 30\u201350% of the baryons at low\nredshift (Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999). BLAs\nmay trace the 105 to 106 K WHIM if the broadening\nis purely thermal, following T [K] = (b[km s\u22121 ]/0.129)2.\nThe cosmological mass density of the broad Ly\u03b1 absorbers in terms of today critical density can be written\n(Richter et al. 2004; Sembach et al. 2004) as,\n\u03a9(BLA) =\n\n\u03bcH mH H0 \u03a3fH (Ti )NHI (i)\n\u03c1c c\n\u03a3\u2206X\n\n\u03a3fH (Ti )NHI (i)\n(9)\n\u03a3\u2206X\nwhere fH (T ) being the conversion factor between H I\nand total H and the other symbols have the same meaning as in Eq. 7. For our sample, \u03a3\u2206X = 2.404. In Eq. 9\nthe sum of fH (Ti )NHI (i) over index i is a measure of\nthe total hydrogen column density in the BLAs. When\ncollisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) is assumed, the\nconversion factor between H I and total H was approximated by Richter et al. (2004) from the values given in\nSutherland & Dopita (1993) for temperatures 105 \u2212 106\nK:\n\u03a9(BLA) \u2248 1.667 \u00d7 10\u221223\n\nlog fH (T ) \u2248 \u221213.9 + 5.4 log T \u2212 0.33(log T )2 .\n\n(10)\n\nFor low-density absorbers, the CIE hypothesis is,\nhowever, probably a poor approximation because the\nphotoionization from the UV background is important\n(Richter et al. 2006b). Recently, Richter et al. (2006a)\nused the output of the numerical simulation, carried out\nby Fang & Bryan (2001) to investigate the intervening\nO VI absorption in the WHIM, to study the BLAs in the\nlow redshift IGM. They found that a significant number of BLAs could be photoionized, in particular systems that have relatively low b-values in the range 40\u201365\nkm s\u22121 . Their simulation that includes collisional ionization and photoionization suggests that the hydrogen\nionization fraction can be approximated as:\nlog fH (T ) \u2248 \u22120.75 + 1.25 log T .\n\n(11)\n\nAccording to Fig. 5 in Richter et al. (2006a), the CIE\nhypothesis (Eq. 10) provides a firm lower limit to fH (T ).\nEqs. 10 and 11 converge as b increases, but never intersect.\nIn Table 5 and \u00a73.3, we saw that the S/N has little\neffect on the estimate for dN (BLA)/dz for the highest S/N spectra, but can reduce dN (BLA)/dz for the\nlowest S/N data in our sample. To reduce the uncertainty from the broadening of the H I absorbers found in\nlow S/N spectra, we restricted our sample to absorbers\nwith \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.3. To estimate \u03a9(BLA), we consider the following b-value intervals: [40, 150], [40, 65],\nand [65, 150] km s\u22121 . In the [40, 65] km s\u22121 interval,\nRichter et al. (2006a) found that about a 1/3 of the\nBLAs traces cool photoionized gas (T < 2 \u00d7 104 K),\ni.e. bnt \u226b bth for these systems. If all the BLAs are\nassumed to be thermally broadened, we would overestimate \u03a9(BLA). We therefore randomly pick 2/3 of the\nBLAs in the [40, 65] km s\u22121 b-range to estimate fH . (We\nnote that the baryon content of the photoionized BLAs\nwith T . 104 K is less than 1\u20132% according to Richter\n\n\f22\n\nLehner et al.\n\net al. 2006a.) In the [65, 150] km s\u22121 b-range, the number of BLAs tracing cool photoionized systems is small\n(less than \u223c5%) and we assume that all the BLAs in\nthis range of b-values are mostly thermally broadened.\nWith the conditions listed above, there are 12 systems\nin the [65, 150] km s\u22121 interval and 31 in the [40, 65]\nkm s\u22121 b-range. In Table 8, we summarize our estimates\nof \u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b using Eqs. 9, 10, and 11 where T was\nderived assuming bth \u2248 0.9bobs following the simulation\nof Richter et al. (2006a). The largest difference in the\nestimates of the baryon budget from CIE and Richter\net al.'s model is for low b-values, where photoionization\nplays a more important role. We note that that if we\nrestricted our sample to systems with \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.2,\n\u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b would decrease by a factor \u223c1.2, but would\nincrease by a factor \u223c1.2\u20132.4 if \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4.\nAs for the estimate of the baryon budget of the NLAs,\nwith our current knowledge it appears a very difficult\ntask to estimate an error on the baryon budget in BLAs.\nIt is model dependent. Richter et al. (2006a) provided\nestimates of the amount of the BLAs that probe cool\nphotoionized gas and the amount of thermal broadening in BLAs. These estimates may change with refined\ncosmological models. If we assume that the broadening for all the BLAs is purely thermal (bth = bobs ),\nthe estimates of \u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b in the [40, 150] km s\u22121 brange would increase by a factor 1.6, i.e. in the CIE\nmodel, \u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b \u2243 0.13, and in the collisional ionization plus photoionization model of Richter et al. (2006a),\n\u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b \u2243 0.32. The broadening could be due to\nseveral unresolved components in some cases or the nonthermal broadening could be important. This is partly\naccounted for since we remove a 1/3 of the BLAs in\nthe [40, 65] km s\u22121 b-range. Since we discarded systems with large errors in b and N , for the current data\nset, a single Gaussian fit provides a good representation of the observed profiles. However, as we discussed\nin \u00a73.2, the formal errors given by the fit may not be\nsufficient especially for the weaker and broader systems.\nRichter et al. (2006b) and the other papers mentioned in\nTable 1 present several examples of BLAs that are well\nfitted with a single Gaussian with sometimes the presence\nof several H I Lyman series transitions that further constrain the fit parameters (see also the discussion in \u00a74.2).\nTo further explore the quality of the profile fitting, the\nCosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) could really improve\nthe situation by increasing the number of sightlines and\nincreasing the S/N in the spectra. Additional theoretical\nsimulations of the low-z IGM with higher resolution and\nrefined physics combined with the analysis of simulated\nspectra should improve our understanding of the BLAs.\nIn summary, the CIE estimate provides a firm and\nconservative limit for the baryon budget in collisionally ionized BLAs, \u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b & 0.1 for systems with\n40 < b . 150 km s\u22121 , log NHI \u2265 13.2, \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.3.\nThe BLA simulations show that the ionization fraction\nin BLAs is governed by collisional ionization and photoionization. Therefore, \u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b & 0.2 (with the\nsame constraints that those listed above) should reflect\nbetter the baryon budget of the BLAs in the low-z IGM.\nThis is likely a lower estimate as well since the existing\nobservations do not have the S/N to detect the broader\nsystems (where most of the baryons are believed to exist)\n\nTABLE 8\nEstimates of the Baryon Density in\nBLAs\nb [km s\u22121 ]\n\n\u03a9CIE (BLA)a\n\u03a9b\n\n\u03a9C+P (BLA)b\n\u03a9b\n\n[40, 65]\n[65, 150]\n[40, 150]\n\n0.03\n0.05\n0.08\n\n0.11\n0.09\n0.20\n\nNote. - Only data with \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.3\nand log NHI \u2265 13.2 are included in the various samples.

Baryon Budget of the Low Redshift Universe\n\nAt redshift 2\u20134, observations of the Ly\u03b1 forest show\nthat about 80\u201390% of the total baryon budget is found in\nthe cool photoionized phase of IGM (Rauch et al. 1997;\nWeinberg et al. 1997; Kim et al. 2001). In the low redshift universe, Fukugita et al. (1998) show that 9\u201310 %\nof the total baryons are found in galaxies (stars, neutral\ngas, molecular gas) and \u223c6 % of the baryons are associated with the hot plasma in clusters of galaxies.\nOur analysis of the low redshift Ly\u03b1 forest shows the\npresence of NLAs and BLAs. The NLAs trace the cool\nphotoionized IGM, while the BLAs are likely to probe the\ncool photoionized IGM and the hot highly-ionized gas in\nthe WHIM. There are still many uncertainties that are\nnot controlled in the determination of the baryon content\nin the low redshift Ly\u03b1 forest. But at least 20% of the\nbaryons are found in the denser parts of the photoionized phase (NLAs, b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 , log NHI \u2265 13.2, and\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4) and at least \u223c10% are found in the\nWHIM (BLAs, 40 < b \u2264 150 km s\u22121 , log NHI \u2265 13.2,\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.3), corresponding to at least 30% of the\ntotal baryon budget. We believe that these limits are\nvery conservative since they do not take into account\nthe low column density photoionized absorbers and the\nbroadest BLAs. Furthermore recent simulations of the\nBLAs in low redshift universe show that the BLAs may\ntrace both photoionized and collisionally ionized gas. Using the simulations of Richter et al. (2006a), we find that\nthe BLAs include at least 20% of the baryons. We have\nalso seen that \u03a9 in the cool photoionized IGM is dominated by the low column density H I absorbers (i.e. absorbing gas with overdensity \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 . 2). If the weak systems follow the same differential column density distribution function as the stronger absorbers, the cool photoionized gas traced by the NLAs with log NHI \u2265 12.4\ncan contain \u223c30% of the total baryons. Combining these\nNLA and BLA budgets, the low redshift IGM contains\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\nat least \u223c50% of the baryons. This is much larger than\nthe known amount of baryons in galaxies and clusters\nof galaxies in the low redshift universe. High S/N data\nwill allow us to search for the weakest Ly\u03b1 absorbers\n(. 1012.5 cm\u22122 ) and estimate their column density distribution, search for the very broad absorbers and the\nweak BLAs, and provide a better understanding of their\nphysical nature. It is, however, already apparent from\nthis study that the IGM traced by the narrow and broad\nLy\u03b1 absorption lines in the low redshift universe is a major reservoir of baryons.\n7. SUMMARY\n\nWe analyze the physical properties of the low-z IGM\ntraced by H I absorbers from a sample of 7 QSOs observed with the E140M mode of STIS (R \u223c 44000) and\nwith FUSE (R \u223c 15000). These seven lines of sight were\nfully analyzed and presented in recent and future papers\n(see references in Table 1 and the Appendix of this paper). Our sample has a total unblocked redshift path\nof 2.064 corresponding to a total absorption distance of\n2.404 and is complete for log NHI & 13.2 provided b . 80\nkm s\u22121 . With high spectral resolution the column density (NHI ) and the Doppler parameter (b) were independently estimated, providing the opportunity to directly\nstudy the distribution and evolution of b. The spectral\nresolution of the STIS E140M H I observations in our\nsample is similar to that of the high redshift (z & 1.5) observations obtained with Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES.\nThis similarity allows a relatively simple study of the\nevolution of the b-parameter of the neutral hydrogen gas\nin the intergalactic medium. Because the nominal lower\ntemperature of the WHIM is T \u223c 105 K, we consider\ntwo different populations of H I absorbers throughout\nthis work: narrow Ly\u03b1 absorbers (NLAs) have b \u2264 40\nkm s\u22121 and the broad Ly\u03b1 absorbers (BLAs) have b > 40\nkm s\u22121 . Our main findings applicable at redshifts z . 0.4\nare summarized as follows:\n1. The H I Doppler width distribution has a high velocity tail that develops at b \u2248 40\u201360 km s\u22121 . The b\u2013NHI\ndistribution reveals for the NLAs an increase of b with increasing NHI with a very large scatter. We find that most\nof the BLAs are found in the H I column density range\n[13.2,14.0] dex and the broader systems are found for\n13.1 . log NHI . 13.5. Recent cosmological simulations\nof BLAs show a good agreement with the observations,\nbut clearly indicate that broader absorbers and many\nweak BLAs (log NHI . 13.1) remain to be discovered.\n2. We find dN (BLA)/dz = 30 \u00b1 4 for absorbers with\n40 < b . 150 km s\u22121 , log NHI \u2265 13.2, and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264\n0.4. The narrow H I absorbers are more frequent, with\ndN (NLA)/dz = 66 \u00b1 6 for absorbers with b \u2264 40 km s\u22121 ,\nlog NHI \u2265 13.2, and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4. Very narrow\nabsorbers (b . 15 km s\u22121 ) with log NHI \u2265 13.2 are scarce.\nThe number of weak NLAs and BLAs (log NHI \u2264 14) is\nfar larger than the number of strong NLAs and BLAs,\nrespectively.\n3. For the narrow absorbers with 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264\n16.5 and \u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4, we find that the column\n\u2212\u03b2\ndensity distribution, f (NHI ) \u221d NHI\n, can be fitted with\n\u03b2 = 1.76 \u00b1 0.06. For the entire sample (i.e. including\nNLAs and BLAs), the slope changes to 1.84 for the same\ncolumn density range. We confirm an increase of \u03b2 with\n\n23\n\ndecreasing z when our results are compared to higher\nredshift analyses. There is some weak evidence for a\nbreak at log NHI \u223c 14.4, but the location of this break is\nuncertain because of the small number statistics for the\nhigher column density lines.\n4. We argue that various samples probing different\nredshift ranges can be directly compared when the conditions 0 < b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 , 13.2 \u2264 log NHI \u2264 14.0, and\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.4 are set. The distribution of b for the\nbroad absorbers has a distinctly more prominent high\nvelocity tail at low z than at high z (1.5 . z . 3.6).\nThe median and mean b-values are systematically larger\nby \u223c15\u201330% at z . 0.5 than at 1.5 . z . 3.6. The\nratio of the number density of BLAs to NLAs at low z is\nlarger than at high z by a factor \u223c3. This suggests that\na larger fraction of the low-z universe is hotter than at\n1.5 . z . 3.6 and/or the low-z universe is more kinematically disturbed than the high-z universe.\n5.\nThe NLAs trace the cool photoionized IGM\nat T . 104 K, and we find that \u03a9(NLA)/\u03a9b \u2243\n\u22121.76\n0.2 (Nmin/[1013.2 cm\u22122 ])\u22120.18 (when f (NHI ) \u221d NHI\n\u22120.42\nand assuming NHI \u221d T\n), where Nmin is the lowest H I column density in the sample considered to estimate \u03a9(NLA). The contribution to the baryon budget\nof the denser parts of the photoionized Ly\u03b1 forest with\nlog NHI & 13.2 is \u223c20%. If the weakest H I absorber with\nlog NHI = 12.4 follows the same f (NHI ), the cool photoionized gas with log NHI & 12.4 contains about 30% of\nthe total baryons.\n6. The BLAs trace mostly the highly-ionized gas in\nthe WHIM at T \u2243 105 \u2013106 K if the width of the BLAs\nis dominated by thermal motions. The assumption of\ncollisional ionization equilibrium provides a firm lower\nlimit to the amount of the baryons in the WHIM traced\nby the BLAs (40 < b . 150 km s\u22121 , log NHI \u2265 13.2,\n\u03c3b /b, \u03c3N /N \u2264 0.3): \u03a9(BLA)/\u03a9b & 10%. If a hydrodynamical simulation including the effects of collisional\nionization and photoionization is used to estimate the\nionization correction for the BLAs, we find that at least\n20% of the baryons are in the BLAs.\n7. Our most conservative estimate of the baryon\nbudget in absorbers with log NHI & 13.2 shows that\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest has at least about 30% of the baryons\n(NLAs+BLAs), far larger than the baryon budget in\ngalaxies. We suggest that the low redshift IGM with\nT . 106 K traced by the NLAs with log NHI & 12.4\nand the BLAs with log NHI & 13.2 could contain at least\n50% of the baryons (this is a lower limit since the broader\nBLAs where most the baryons reside remain to be discovered). The estimates of the amount of baryons still\nrely, however, on critical assumptions (e.g. pure thermal\nbroadening versus other broadening mechanisms, temperature of the IGM, behavior of the weak narrow systems) that produce uncertainties that are currently not\nwell controlled. Observationally, if COS is deployed, our\nunderstanding of the BLAs, in particular, will improve\ngiven the high S/N spectra that COS should obtain (but\nwith approximately 2 times lower resolution than for the\nSTIS observations presented here). The present paper\nand future observations of the low-z IGM should motivate more precise cosmological simulations of the lowand high-z IGM that are needed for our understanding\nof the intrinsic properties of the BLAs and NLAs.\n\n\f24\n\nLehner et al.\n\nWe thank the HST and FUSE mission operation teams\nfor their continuous efforts to provide excellent UV\nand FUV spectroscopic data to the astronomical community.

We were first\nmotivated to produce a new analysis of the PKS 0405\u2013123 FUSE and STIS/E140M spectra because Williger et al.\n(2006) noted that several of their BLAs may be noise features. For our work, we needed to clearly differentiate a real\ndetection from a noise feature. While reanalyzing the BLAs, we noted that some narrow H I lines were either not\npresent in the spectra at the 3\u03c3 level (although Williger et al. claimed to report only 4\u03c3 features) or were misidentified.\nWe have not identified the ultimate origin of the problem, but we suspect that the difference with Williger et al. can\nultimately be traced to a difference in the manner in which the continuum placement was done. Williger et al. fitted a\nsingle global continuum, while we determine continua separately placed within \u00b11000\u20133000 km s\u22121 of each absorption\nline. We therefore produce here a new line list and new measurements for H I toward PKS 0405-0123 in Table A1.\nThis reanalysis also provides an overall coherent data sample, since the other sightlines were analyzed following the\nsame methodology. In Table A1, we report our measurements for H I toward PKS 0405\u2013123. These H I absorbers\n\n\fLy\u03b1 Forest at z . 0.4\n\n25\n\nare detected at least at the 3\u03c3 level. We list in this table the observed wavelengths and the rest-frame equivalent\nwidths of the Ly\u03b1 transition. The listed column densities and Doppler parameters were measured in the rest-frame\nby N. Lehner (NL) following the method described in Lehner et al. (2006). The weak absorbers (log NHI < 14) were\nalso independently measured by P. Richter (PR) using the method described in Richter et al. (2004). In particular,\ndifferent profile fitting software was used by NL and PR. In Fig. 15, we compare the column densities and b-values (for\nthe weak absorbers) presented by Williger et al. (2006) to those listed in Table A1 (left panels). On the right-hand\nside, we present the measurements obtained by PR against those listed in Table A1. For both b and NHI , there is\nan excellent agreement between PR and NL measurements at the 1\u03c3 level. In contrast, Williger et al. (GW) found\ngenerally larger column densities and Doppler parameters. The main difference between our analysis (NL and PR) and\nGW's analysis is that we systematically and independently chose the continua within \u00b11000\u20133000 km s\u22121 of the H I\nabsorption line, while GW fitted the continuum using a semi-automatic procedure (AUTOVP) combined with custom\nfitting in the vicinity of the QSO emission lines. Since these weak absorbers are generally detected solely in Ly\u03b1, the\ncontinuum placement is critical. Our method for the continuum placement was followed for all the other sightlines\npresented in this work. For the absorbers where Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 are detected, our measurements and those made by\nGW agree within 1\u03c3.\nAbsorbers with log NHI > 14 are detected in several Lyman series lines. For the absorbers that were fitted with\na single component (z = 0.03000, 0.35099, 0.40571, 0.40886), GW and our measurements are in agreement within 1\u03c3.\nGW fitted the systems listed in Table A1 at z = (0.09657, 0.09659) and (0.18262,0.18287) with a single component.\nWe found that a 2-component fit provides a statistically better fit. The total column densities for those absorbers are\nin agreement within 1\u03c3 with those measured by GW. For the partial Lyman limit system at z = 0.167, we found that\n5 components provide a better fit to this complicated absorber (see Fig. 16 and note (6) in Table A1). We note that\nour fit is not yet as good as it should be despite our best effort (see Fig. 16). In particular, the broad component\nat z = 0.16678 may actually be narrower since metals-ions such as C III are detected at this redshift (this directly\naffects the measurements of the absorber at z = 0.16661 where C III is also detected). Finally, we fitted the system\nat z = 0.36808 with 4 components. This is not statistically different from the 2 component fit presented by GW, but\nthe 4-component fit appears to be a better model when the kinematics of the metal-ions are taken into account (see\nnote (12) in Table A1 for more details).\nIn Table A2, we report the list of features that were identified as Ly\u03b1 and claimed to be detected at least at the\n4\u03c3 level by GW. These features are actually either non-detections at the 3\u03c3 level (according to our measurements) or\nwere misidentified. The 181 Ly\u03b1 absorbers toward PKS 0405\u2013123 reported by GW now reduce to 74 absorbers (and\nin a few cases, those are multi-component absorbers).\n\n\f26\n\nLehner et al.\nTABLE 9\nIGM H I

If the BLA is mostly thermally broadened, it yields a temperature of T \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 K.\nO VI is found in this absorber (Prochaska et al. 2004). The temperature found from the H I broadening is consistent with O VI being mainly\ncollisionally ionized.\n(4) This profile appears asymmetric, but within the S/N a single component fit is suitable. This system is, however, not accounted in the BLAs\nin this paper because of the asymmetry.\n(5) The Ly\u03b1 for the systems at z = 0.16121 and 0.16150 were fitted simultaneously.\n(6) The systems at z = 0.16661, 0.16678, 0.16694, 0.16712, and 0.16714 were fitted simultaneously. The equivalent width reported at z = 0.16714 is\nthe total equivalent width for these absorbers. The systems at z = 0.1671 are detected from Ly\u03b1 down to the Lyman Limit. Prochaska et al. (2004)\nderived the total column density of the system at z \u2243 0.1671 using the flux decrement at the Lyman limit. Williger et al. (2006) fixed the column\ndensity found by Prochaska et al. (2004) for the systems at z = 0.16714 and used H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025 to derive b. They fitted a very broad absorber\nat z = 0.16692 and a very narrow absorber at z = 0.16628. This fit appears satisfactory for H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025, but not for the other transitions (see\nFig. 16). In particular, the core of the higher H I Lyman series is not reproduced. To reproduce the core of the line, we find that a 2-component fit\nis necessary: a very narrow component with b = 12 km s\u22121 and a broader (but still relatively narrow) component with b = 30 km s\u22121 . Furthermore\nthe C II and C III kinematics (see Figs. 9 and 10 in Prochaska et al. 2004) indicate 4 distinct components at \u2212136, \u221293, \u221240, 0 km s\u22121 . We,\ntherefore, fitted 5 components set initially at \u2212136, \u221293, \u221240, \u22125, 5 km s\u22121 . The velocity of the component at \u221240 km s\u22121 was not allowed to\nvary; all the other parameters for the various components were allowed to vary. For the fit, we used simultaneously detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025,\n937, 930, 926, 923, 919, 918, 917 lines. H I \u03bb\u03bb972 and 949 are contaminated, while H I \u03bb920 suffers from fixed-pattern noise. We did not use\nhigher Lyman series transitions because the continuum placement becomes uncertain due to the flux decrement. The resulting fit is shown in Fig.\n16. We note that Prochaska et al. (2004) used a curve-of-growth analysis with two components separated by 40 km s\u22121 based on the C II and\nSi II profiles and found 16.35 and 15.5 dex, which is roughly consistent with our results for the systems z = 0.16694, 0.16712, 0.16714. While our\nfit appears more satisfactory than the one presented by Williger et al. (2006) who did not take into account the velocity structure of the metal-ion\nprofiles, the solution may actually be more complicated. The errors do not reflect that there may be more than 5 components. In particular, the\nbroad component at z = 0.16678 may actually be narrower since metal-ions such as C III are detected at this redshift; this directly affects the\nmeasurements of the absorber at z = 0.16661 where C III is also detected. Therefore we mark the measurements at z = 0.16661 and 0.16678 as\nuncertain.\n(7) The systems at z = 0.18261 and 0.18287 were fitted simultaneously. We used detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 972, 949 (H I \u03bb\u03bb1025, 937 are contaminated).\nWe note that Williger et al. (2006) fitted a single component at z = 0.18271: a 2-component fit improves the fit. The equivalent width is the total\nequivalent width including both systems.\n(8) The systems at z = 0.24513 and 0.24554 were fitted simultaneously. We used detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215,1025 in the profile fitting.\n(9) We fitted simultaneously detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025. We note that H I \u03bb972 is also detected and possibly contaminated by a weak Ly\u03b1 system.\n(10) We fitted simultaneously detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025.\n(11) The Ly\u03b1 for the systems at z = 0.34186 and 0.34234 were fitted simultaneously.\n(12) The equivalent width is the total equivalent width including the systems at z = 0.36079, 0.36080, 0.36115, 0.36150. The system at z = 0.36080\nis detected in H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025, 972, 949, 937, 930, 923 (H I \u03bb926 is contaminated). We undertook to fit these lines with 2, 3, and 4 components.\nStatistically, these fits are comparably good because Ly\u03b1 is so noisy. The 3- and 4-component fits appear, however, to be better models than the\n2-component fit, especially when one takes into account that O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031, 1037 appear to be present in the weakest component. The 3-component\nfit does not fit the blue edge of the Ly\u03b1 profile as well as the 4-component fit, but otherwise the 3- or 4-component fits are quite similar. We note\nthat our 2-component fit yields similar results to those found by the 2-component fit of Williger et al. (2006).\n(13) Partially blended with interstellar C I* \u03bb1657.379.\n(14) We fitted simultaneously detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025, 972, 949, 937, 930, 926, 923.\n(15) We fitted simultaneously detected H I \u03bb\u03bb1215, 1025, 972, 949.\n\nTABLE 10\nNon-detection and confusion with other ISM/IGM lines listed as\nLy\u03b1 detection in Williger et al.
