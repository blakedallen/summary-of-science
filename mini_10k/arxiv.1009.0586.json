The foliation of an ndimensional manifold, M, is a decomposition of M into submanifolds, all being of the\nsame dimension, p. The submanifolds are the leaves of the foliation. The co-dimension,\nq, of a foliation is defined as q = n \u2212 p. A foliation of co-dimension one is called a\nfoliation by hypersurfaces. The simplest and best understood cases of foliation are\nwhen p = q = 1, e.g. the two dimensional xy-plane, R2 , which can be foliated by the\nstraight lines, y = mx + c, with c taken as the parameter and any fixed m. Notice that\na foliation of the of xy-plane by straight lines is not unique, as different 'fixed' values\nof m will give different sequences of foliating straight lines with a different slope.\nIn General Relativity (GR) one often requires to use a sequence of spacelike or null\nhypersurfaces to foliate the spacetime. There has been a lot of work to obtain foliations by hypersurfaces of zero mean extrinsic curvature called 'maximal slicing' [1]-[4]\nand by hypersurfaces of constant mean extrinsic curvature known as 'CMC-slicing'\n[4]-[11]. There has also been significant work on foliations by hypersurfaces of zero intrinsic curvature called 'flat foliations' [12]-[18]. Existence of flat spacelike foliations for\nspherically symmetric static spactimes (SSSS) is shown via the Hamiltonian equations\nof general relativity in [14] and using an initial value approach in [15], [16]. Complete\nfoliations of the Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m (RN) spacetimes by flat space2\n\n\flike hypersurfaces is also obtained using the fact that the normals to such foliations are\ngeodesics [17], [18]. Being indirect approaches, earlier procedures do not guarantee the\nuniqueness of these foliations. As a flat foliation covers the most interesting regions of\nspacetime describing realistic gravitational collapse it is specially suited for studying\nHawking radiation from a fully quantum gravitational viewpoint. Husain and Winkler\n[19] have presented a flat slice Hamiltonian formalism to have \"a standard model\" for\nstudying black hole physics. The non-uniqueness of flat foliations may raise the question on the validity of the results if a different sequence of flat slices is used in their\nmodel.\nIn this paper, in order to obtain flat spacelike hypersurfaces, we use the direct approach\ni\ni\n(i.e. solve Rjkl\n= 0, where Rjkl\nare the components of the Riemann curvature tensor\n\nfor the hypersurfaces). Solution of the above system gives a unique sequence of flat\nspherically symmetric spacelike hypersurfaces admitted by SSSS, thus showing the\nuniqueness of flat spherically symmetric foliations for such spacetimes. In the following\nsections, after presenting solution of the equations giving flat spherically symmetric\nhypersurfaces and some examples, a conclusion is given.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nFlat Spherically Symmetric Hypersurfaces Admitted by Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetimes\n\nThe most general form of a spherically symmetric static spacetime metric in the usual\ncoordinates is\nds2 = e\u03c5(r) dt2 \u2212 e\u03bb(r) dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n(1)\n\nd\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nNow take an arbitrary hypersurface, f (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = 0. Considering spherical symmetry,\ntaking \u03b8 and \u03c6 constant, this hypersurface in explicit form can be given as\nt = F (r).\n\n(3)\n\nThe induced 3-metric (of the hypersurfaces) is then\n\u0001\nds23 = \u2212 e\u03bb(r) \u2212 e\u03c5(r) F \u20322 dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03a92 .\n\n(4)\n\nFor the induced metric to be flat a necessary but not sufficient condition, namely the\nRicci scalar = R = 0, implies\nr \u2212\u03bb\u2032 e\u03bb + \u03bd \u2032 e\u03bd F \u20322 + 2e\u03bd F \u2032 F \u2032\u2032\n(e\u03bb \u2212 e\u03bd F \u20322 )2\n\n\u0001\n\n+\n\n1 \u2212 e\u03bb + e\u03bd F \u20322\n= 0,\ne\u03bb \u2212 e\u03bd F \u20322\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u2032 represents the derivative with respect to r. Using the substitution\ng 2 (r) =\n\ne\u03bb\n4\n\n1\n,\n\u2212 e\u03bd F \u20322\n\n(6)\n\n\fEq.(5) becomes\n2rgg \u2032 + g 2 \u2212 1 = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nc\ng 2 (r) = 1 \u2212 ,\nr\n\n(8)\n\nand we have the general solution\n\nwhere c is an arbitrary constant with dimensions of length.

Notice that the\nexpression in Eq.(13) is same as the Lema\u0131\u0302tre coordinates (see, e.g., [20]) for the\nSchwarzschild geometry or the flat hypersurfaces obtained by using the fact that these\nhypersurfaces are orthogonal to the unforced geodesics in [18].

Perhaps, assuming the difficulty to solve\ni\nthe system of differential equations, Rjkl\n= 0, in all earlier works indirect approaches\n\nhave been used. In this paper, in order to obtain all possible sequences of flat spherically\nsymmetric hypersurfaces admitted by SSSS, we have solved this system of differential\nequations. It is found that there exists a unique sequence of flat spherically symmetric\nspacelike hypersurfaces admitted by SSSS, guaranteeing the uniqueness of foliation by\nthese hypersurfaces for such spacetimes. To emphasize the point, it is not just that the\nfoliation of SSSS by flat spherically symmetric spacelike hypersurfaces is unique, but\nthat these spacetimes admit a unique sequence of flat spherically symmetric spacelike\nhypersurfaces which form a foliation. Notice that the flat spherically symmetric spacelike hypersurfaces can also be obtained simply by changing the sign in Eq.(3) and in\n7\n\n\fexpressions for extrinsic curvatures. This corresponds to the hypersurfaces orthogonal\nto the incoming instead of outgoing geodesics [18].\nIn this paper we have studied flat slices of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes,\nwhere the slices themselves are also assumed to have spherical symmetry. Dropping\nthe latter restriction would result in a study of a system of partial differential equations\nfor the height function, as opposed to the ordinary differential equation, Eq.(5), of the\nslice. This is outside the scope we have set ourselves here.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of the authors AAS highly appreciates role of the Higher Education Commission\nof Pakistan and is thankful for the financial support during the post doctoral research\nin Sweden during which this work was initiated.
