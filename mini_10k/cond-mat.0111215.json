Such systems are a physical\nrealization of the frustrated classical\nXY model where the degree of frustration is governed by a parameter f\nexpressing the magnetic flux thread-\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\ning an elementary cell of the array\nin units of the superconducting flux\nquantum.\nWhile the nature of the superconducting transition of a Josephson\njunction array (JJA) at arbitrary\nfrustrations is still not well understood, the critical behavior of square\nJJAs at full frustration (f=1/2) has\nbeen widely investigated theoretically and with numerical simulations. Because of the \"checkerboard\"\n24 October 2018\n\n\fcouplings at f=1/2 which unambiguously demonstrate the existence of a\ndouble transition with features consistent with the Ising-KT scenario.\n\nstructure of the ground state [1],\ntwo symmetries are relevant in determining the critical behavior of a\nfully frustrated JJA: the continuous U(1) rotational symmetry and\nthe discrete Z2 chiral symmetry [1\u2013\n3]. The phase transition resulting\nby breaking U(1) is driven, at a\ntemperature TBKT , by the vortex\nunbinding mechanism predicted by\nthe Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(BKT) theory, whereas the transition associated with Z2 is triggered\nby the proliferation of Ising-like domain walls at a temperature TI . The\nquestion of whether these two transitions are disinct [4] or merge into a\nsingle transition belonging to a new\nuniversality class [5] has been controversial for a long time. Quite recently\nKorshunov [6] has shown that the\nfirst scenario, with TI > TBKT , is the\nonly possible one. Although distinct,\nthe two transitions are, however,\nvery close to each other, making experiments conceived to explore their\nexact nature rather difficult. From\nan experimental point of view, the\nsituation is more favorable in frustrated arrays whose coupling energy\nEJ is periodically modulated in one\nof the principal lattice directions.\nTheir critical behavior was first studied with Monte Carlo simulations by\nBerge et al. [7] and, subsequently, by\nEikmans et al. [8] using a Coulomb\ngas approach. In arrays with a sufficiently strong EJ -modulation the\ntwo transitions are predicted to be\nwell separated (with TI < TBKT )\nand thus accessible to experimental observation. In this brief report\nwe present preliminary results of\nac sheet conductance measurements\nperformed on JJAs with modulated\n\nFig. 1. a) SEM picture of a portion of\nthe array showing Pb crosses on a Cu\nground plane. The lattice parameter is\na = 8\u03bcm. The \"weak\" JJs compose\nthe first and third lines (WB), whereas\nthe \"strong\" junctions (SB) compose\nthe second and fourth lines. b) Picture\nof one square plaquette of the array\nshowing the three \"strong\" junctions\n(L=0.8\u03bcm) and the lengthened junction (L+\u2206L=0.9\u03bcm).\n\nThe experiments were carried out on\nsquare arrays of proximity-effect coupled SNS (superconducting-normalsuperconducting) Josephson junctions consisting of \u223c 106 Pb superconducting (S) islands forming a\nsquare lattice on a normal (N) Cu\nlayer. To periodically modulate EJ ,\nthe N-bridges of the junctions located\non alternating rows were slightly\nlengthened in order to decrease their\ncoupling energy with respect to that\nof all the other junctions in the array (see Fig. 1). The lengths of the\nN-metal gaps of the array shown in\nFig. 1 are 0.8\u03bcm for the strong bonds\n(SB) and 0.92\u03bcm for the weak bonds\n(WB). The transition temperature of\nthe S-islands was TCS = 7.02K and\nthe normal metal coherence length\n\u03beN (TCS ) \u223c\n= 80nm. Kinetic inductance measurements performed on\n2\n\n\fthe unfrustrated (f=0) array [10] allow to estimate the ratio \u03b7 between\nthe coupling energies of the weak and\nthe strong bonds. We find \u03b7 \u223c\n= 0.4\nin the temperature range of interest.\nThe sheet resistance of the array in\nthe normal state was RN \u223c\n= 3m\u03a9.\nTo explore the properties of the array\nin the critical region, we measured\nits complex ac sheet conductance\nG(\u03c9, T ) at f=1/2 using a SQUIDoperated two-coil mutual inductance\ntechnique [9], which allows to probe\ncritical fluctuations over a frequency\nrange covering more than 5 decades\n(0.1 Hz - 10 kHz). At the temperatures of interest (T \u223c\n= 5K) we\nestimate that the vortex diffusion\nlength (r\u03c9 /a \u223c (14RN kB T /\u03c9\u03c620)1/2 )\nis about 103 lattice constants at the\nlowest accessible frequencies. Thus,\nat these very large length scales, our\nlow-frequency conductance measurements should reflect the response of\nthe array in the quasi-static thermodynamic limit. In this regime therefore the inverse sheet inductance\nL\u22121\n= \u03c9Im(G), which is propor\u0003\ntional to the areal superfluid density\nand measures the degree of superconducting phase coherence in the\nsystem, is directly comparable with\nMonte Carlo simulations of the array\nhelicity modulus [8].\n\nFig. 2. Inverse sheet inductance (L\u22121\n\u0003 )\nand resistance (R) vs temperature at\nfull frustration f=1/2. The softening of\nthe superconducting phase coherence at\nTI is evidenced by a depression of L\u22121\n\u0003\nand a corresponding shallow peak in R.\nThe total disappearance of phase coherence and the rapid increase of dissipation are the signatures of the BKT transition. Dotted line: BKT prediction for\nL\u22121\n\u0003 (TBKT ).\n\naccompanied by a peak in dissipation. Relying on the Coulomb\ngas analogy [8], we identify these\nfeatures as the signatures of the\n\"antiferroelectric-paraelectric\" Ising\ntransition triggered by the proliferation of domain walls in the system\nof dipoles created by the attractive\ninteraction, across the weak bonds,\nof half-integer charges. This inter-\n\n(L\u22121\n\u0003 )\n\nIn Fig. 2 both the superfluid\nand the dissipative (R=Re(1/G))\ncomponents of the conductance extracted from the linear response of\nthe fully frustrated (f=1/2) array at\nan excitation frequency of 0.23 Hz\nare shown as a function of temperature on log-lin plots. At T \u223c\n= 4.8K\nthere is a slight depression in L\u22121\n\u0003 (T )\n3\n\n\fpretation is supported by the observation that, in terms of the reduced\ntemperature \u03c4 = kB T /EJ (T ), the\ntransition takes place at \u03c4I = 0.08,\nin good agreement with the value\n(\u03c4I = 0.07) predicted by the phase\ndiagram of Ref.7 for \u03b7 \u223c\n= 0.4. At\nhigher temperatures the superfluid\ncomponent drops dramatically, signaling the suppression of global\nsuperconducting phase coherence,\nat a temperature TBKT \u223c\n= 5.5K,\nwhich is found to be consistent, as\nshown by the dotted line in Fig. 2,\nwith the universal BKT prediction\n2\nL\u22121\n\u0003 (TBKT ) = (8\u03c0/\u03c60 ) kB TBKT .\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
