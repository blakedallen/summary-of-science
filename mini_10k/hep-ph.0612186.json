Simplified\nHitoshi Murayama and Yasunori Nomura\nDepartment of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA and\nTheoretical Physics Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA\n\narXiv:hep-ph/0612186v1 15 Dec 2006\n\nGauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking is drastically simplified using generic superpotentials\nwithout U (1)R symmetry by allowing metastable vacua.\n\nBreaking supersymmetry has been a non-trivial task.\nA general argument by Nelson and Seiberg is that it requires a theory with a continuous exact U (1)R symmetry\nif we assume that the superpotential is generic [1]. In addition, an argument based on the Witten index [2] said\nthat the theory must be chiral. This is because one can\ncontinuously deform a vector-like theory by mass terms\nto a pure Yang-Mills theory, which is known to have a\nfinite Witten index (dual Coxeter number) and hence\nsupersymmetric vacua. Chirality and U (1)R invariance\nstrongly limit the choice of possible theories that break\nsupersymmetry. Therefore explicit models of supersymmetry breaking appear rather special and hence do not\nseem likely to come out from a more fundamental theory\nsuch as string theory. This problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that the supersymmetry breaking sector should couple to the standard model multiplets to induce soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in a flavor-independent\nfashion.\nLater, vector-like models were found [3]. They evade\nthe Witten index argument because the mass terms can\nalways be absorbed by shifting singlet fields in the theory. The required superpotential, however, is not generic\nunless one imposes an exact U (1)R symmetry.\nThe requirement of an exact U (1)R symmetry is unfortunate, because exact global symmetries are not expected\nto exist in quantum theory of gravity such as the fieldtheory limit of string theory. In addition, embedding a\nmodel of supersymmetry breaking into supergravity requires explicit breaking of U (1)R to allow for a constant\nterm in the superpotential needed for canceling the cosmological constant. Once U (1)R is not an exact symmetry, it is not clear how one can justify the form of the\nsuperpotential required for supersymmetry breaking.\nIn this letter, we advocate to discard U (1)R symmetry altogether from the theory, and allow for completely generic superpotentials. According to the Nelson\u2013\nSeiberg argument, such a theory would not break supersymmetry. Yet, it may have a local supersymmetry\nbreaking minimum. Supersymmetry is broken if the lowenergy limit of the supersymmetry breaking sector has\nan accidental U (1)R symmetry, which nonetheless is broken by its coupling to messengers. Indeed, we show a\nvery simple class of models of this type. The models\ndo not have a fundamental singlet field, eliminating aesthetic and various fine-tuning problems in cosmology and\npreserving the hierarchy. The gauginos and scalars in\n\nthe supersymmetric standard model sector obtain flavor\nuniversal masses by standard model gauge interactions\nthrough loops of the messengers. Given the absence of\nU (1)R , there is no problem in generating gaugino masses,\nand no dangerous R-axion arises.\nAn explicit model that realizes our general philosophy\nis a supersymmetric SU (Nc ) QCD with massive vectorlike quarks Qi and Q\u0304i (i = 1, * * * , Nf ). In addition, we\nintroduce massive messengers f and f \u0304 and write the most\ngeneral superpotential consistent with the gauge symmetry. This is the entire model. The important terms in\nthe superpotential are given by\nWtree = mij Q\u0304i Qj +\n\n\u03bbij i j  \u0304\nQ\u0304 Q f f + M f \u0304f,\nMPl\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bbij are coupling constants [12]. (The effects of\nother terms will be discussed later.) For concreteness, we\ntake the messengers f, f \u0304 to be in 5 + 5\u2217 representations\nof SU (5) in which the standard model gauge group is\nembedded.\nIntriligator, Seiberg, and Shih (ISS) pointed out that\nsupersymmetric SU (Nc ) QCD in the free magnetic phase\n(Nc + 1 \u2264 Nf < 23 Nc ) breaks supersymmetry on a\nmetastable local minimum if the quark masses mij are\nmuch smaller than the dynamical scale \u039b [4]. Note that in\nthe ISS model a U (1)R symmetry is broken only down to\nZ2Nc which prevents the gaugino masses. In the present\nmodel, however, the coupling to the messengers breaks\nit down to Z2 , so that the model does not have any R\nsymmetry beyond R-parity.\nFor the sake of concreteness, we discuss the case without the magnetic gauge group Nf = Nc + 1 below, although any Nc + 1 \u2264 Nf < 23 Nc works equally well. At\nenergies below the dynamical scale, the non-perturbative\nlow-energy effective superpotential is described as [5]\nWdyn =\n\n1\n\u039b2Nf \u22123\n\n\u0001\nB\u0304i M ij Bj \u2212 detM ij ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M ij = Q\u0304i Qj , Bi = \u01ebii1 ***iNc Qi1 * * * QiNc /Nc ! and\nB\u0304i = \u01ebii1 ***iNc Q\u0304i1 * * * Q\u0304iNc /Nc ! are meson, baryon and antibaryon chiral superfields, respectively. In the following, we adopt the basis in which the quark mass matrix\nis diagonal, mij = \u2212mi \u03b4ij , with mi real and positive.\nWe also assume that they are ordered as m1 > m2 >\n* * * > mNf > 0 without loss of generality. Here, we have\ntaken all masses different to avoid (potentially) unwanted\nNambu\u2013Goldstone bosons.\n\n\f2\nIn terms of fields with canonical dimensions S ij =\nM ij /\u039b, bi = Bi /\u039bNf \u22122 and b\u0304i = B\u0304i /\u039bNf \u22122 , the dynamical superpotential of Eq. (2) together with the quark\nmass terms (the first term of Eq. (1)) can be written\nas [13]\nWISS = b\u0304i S ij bj \u2212\n\ndetS\n\u2212 mi \u039bS ii .\n\u039bNf \u22123\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nwhere supersymmetry is broken because FS ij =\n\u2212(\u2202S ij W )\u2217 = mi \u03b4ij \u039b 6= 0 for i, j 6= 1. Even though S ij\n(i, j 6= 1) are classically flat directions, they are lifted by\nthe one-loop Coleman\u2013Weinberg potential. As a result,\nthe origin S ij = 0 is a local minimum, with curvature\nm2S ij \u223c m\u039b/16\u03c0 2 for all mi \u223c m. It is long-lived as long\nas mi \u226a \u039b, where the weakly-coupled analysis of the\nlow-energy theory is valid.\nThe existence of a supersymmetry breaking minimum\nof Eq. (4) can be viewed as a result of an accidental\n(and approximate) U (1)R symmetry possessed by the superpotential of Eq. (3) with the R-charge assignments\nR(S ij ) = 2, R(bi ) = R(b\u0304i ) = 0, in the limit of neglecting\nthe irrelevant term of detS ij /\u039bNf \u22123 . In fact, this accidental U (1)R symmetry is also a reason for the origin\nS ij = 0 being the minimum of the effective potential as\na symmetry enhanced point. This picture is corrected\nby the coupling of Qi and Q\u0304i to the messengers and by\nhigher dimension terms in the superpotential omitted in\nEq. (1), which introduce U (1)R violating effects to the\nsupersymmetry breaking sector. These effects, however,\ncan be easily suppressed as we will see later, and the basic picture described above can be a good approximation\nof the dynamics.\nAt the supersymmetry breaking minimum of Eq. (4)\n(with S ij slightly shifted due to U (1)R violating effects),\nthe messenger fields have both supersymmetric and holomorphic supersymmetry breaking masses:\n\u03bbij \u039b ij\nhS i \u2243 M,\nMPl\n\n(5)\n\nand\nFmess =\n\n\u03bbij \u039b\nm\u0304\u039b2\nFS ij =\n,\nMPl\nMPl\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nm\u0304 \u2261\n\nX\ni6=1\n\nmSUSY \u2243\n\nij\n\nFor Nf > 3, the superpotential term detS ij is irrelevant\nand can be ignored to discuss physics around the origin\nS ij = 0 [14]. The superpotential of Eq. (3) then leads to\na local minimum at\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\u221a\nm1 \u039b\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nS ij = 0,\n(4)\nb = b\u0304 = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n.\n\nMmess = M +\n\nThe usual loop diagrams of the messenger fields then induce gauge-mediated scalar and gaugino masses in the\nsupersymmetric standard model sector, of the magnitude [6, 7]\n\n\u03bbii mi .\n\n(7)\n\ng 2 m\u0304\u039b2\n,\n16\u03c0 2 M MPl\n\n(8)\n\nwhere g represents generic standard model gauge coupling constants.\nSeveral conditions for the parameters need to be met\nfor the model to be phenomenologically successful. Even\nthough not necessary, we regard all the quark masses\n(and the couplings \u03bbij ) to be comparable, mi \u223c m (\u03bbij \u223c\n\u03bb), in the numerical estimates below.\nFirst, we would like mSUSY to stabilize the electroweak\nscale, and hence mSUSY = O(100 GeV \u223c 1 TeV). This\ncorresponds to\nm\u0304\u039b2\n\u2248 100 TeV.\nM MPl\n\n(9)\n\nOn the other hand, we would like the gauge-mediated\ncontribution to the scalar masses dominate over the\ngravity-mediated piece to avoid excessive flavor-changing\n\u22122\nprocesses, leading to m3/2 \u2248 m\u039b/MPl <\n\u223c 10 mSUSY .\nTherefore,\n\u22124\nmM <\n\u223c 10 m\u0304\u039b.\n\n(10)\n\nWe also need the messengers to be non-tachyonic,\nM2 >\n\nm\u0304\u039b2\n.\nMPl\n\n(11)\n\nIn addition, the analysis of supersymmetry breaking is\nvalid only if m is sufficiently smaller than \u039b:\nm<\n\u223c 0.1\u039b.\n\n(12)\n\nWe now discuss the effects of U (1)R violation. These\neffects cause shifts\u221a\nof S ij from the origin, which must be\nsmaller than \u2248 4\u03c0 m\u039b for the ISS analysis to be valid,\nand than \u2248 M MPl/\u03bb\u039b to avoid tachyonic messengers.\nOne origin of U (1)R violation comes from higher dimension terms in the superpotential, omitted in Eq. (1). The\ndominant effect comes from\n\u2206W =\n\n\u03bbijkl i j k l\n\u03bbijkl \u039b2 ij kl\nQ\u0304 Q Q\u0304 Q =\nS S .\nMPl\nMPl\n\n(13)\n\nThese terms may destabilize the minimum, since they\nlead to linear terms of S ij in the potential through FS ij =\nmi \u03b4ij \u039b [8]. The squared masses of S ij from the one-loop\neffective potential are m2S ij \u223c m\u039b/16\u03c0 2 , while the linear\nterms are \u223c (\u03bbijkk mk \u039b3 /MPl )S ij . Therefore, the shifts\nof the fields are \u2206S ij \u223c 16\u03c0 2 \u03bbijkk \u039b2 /MPl . Requiring\nthis to be sufficiently small, we obtain the condition\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03bbijkk \u039b2 <\n1/2\n\u22122 M MPl\n.\n(14)\nmin 0.1(m\u039b) , 10\nMPl \u223c\n\u03bb\u039b\n\n\f3\nSimilar conditions can be worked out for even higher order terms, but they are rather mild.\nAnother source of U (1)R violation comes from the coupling of Qi and Q\u0304i to the messengers, which shifts the\nminimum of S ij at the loop level. The effect of the messengers on the S ij effective potential can be calculated\nby computing the one-loop Coleman\u2013Weinberg potential\narising from the last two terms of Eq. (1):\nWmess =\n\n\u03bbij \u039b ij  \u0304\nS f f + M f \u0304f.\nMPl\n\n(15)\n\nThe resulting effective potential takes the following\ngeneric form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bbij \u039bS ij\nm\u03042 \u039b4\n,\n(16)\n\u2206V \u2248\n2 F\n16\u03c0 2 MPl\nM MPl\nwhere F (x) is a real polynomial function with the coefficients of O(1) up to symmetry factors. The resulting\n3\nshifts of S ij are of order \u03bb3 m\u039b4 /M MPl\n, which are sufficiently small if\n\u03bb2 m1/2 \u039b5/2\n.\nM>\n\u223c\nM2\n\n(17)\n\nPl\n\nNote that the coupling to the messengers in Eq. (15) does\nnot generate a new supersymmetric minimum. However,\nturning on the expectation values for the messengers may\nallow for lowering the vacuum energy, depending on the\ncombinations of mij and \u03bbij f \u0304f . Even if this is the case,\nthe tunneling to a lower minimum at f \u0304f \u2248 mMPl /\u03bb can\neasily be made suppressed to the level consistent with\n1/2 3/2\nthe longevity of our universe, if M MPl/\u03bb >\n\u223cm \u039b .\nIt is now easy to see that there is a wide\nrange of parameters that satisfy the conditions\nEqs. (9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17). For instance, if we take\n\u03bbij \u223c \u03bbijkl \u223c 1, \u039b \u223c 1011 GeV, m \u223c m\u0304 \u223c 108 GeV\nand M \u223c 107 GeV, then all the requirements are easily\nsatisfied. Note that the conditions of Eqs. (14, 17) are\ngenerically rather weak, unless \u039b is close to MPl . This\nis because the relevant interactions in Eqs. (13, 15) arise\nfrom higher dimension operators suppressed by MPl .\nFinally, we discuss if there are any unwanted light\nfields in the model. The fermionic fields in S ij (i, j 6= 1)\nare massless in the ISS model, but they acquire masses\nhere due to the generic terms in Eq. (13) [15]. They\ncan decay to standard model particles through their coupling to the messengers and hence harmless. There is a\nNambu\u2013Goldstone boson (NGB) of a spontaneously broken U (1)B symmetry, b1 \u2212 b\u03041 , and its fermionic partner. Exactly massless NGB and fermion would be a\nradiation component of the universe. Their abundance\nis diluted by an order of magnitude due to the QCD\nphase transition and is in general consistent with the constraint from the big-bang nucleosynthesis, \u2206N\u03bd <\n\u223c 1.5 [9].\nAlternatively, they can be made massive by gauging\n\nU (1)B , or avoided entirely by employing an SO(Nc ) or\nSp(Nc ) gauge group for supersymmetry breaking, instead\nof SU (Nc ). The gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle and hence stable if R-parity is unbroken. It\nplaces an upper limit on the reheating temperature [10],\nwhich is acceptable e.g., in leptogenesis models by nonthermal production of right-handed scalar neutrinos [11].\nIn summary, we advocated gauge mediation models\nof supersymmetry breaking with generic superpotentials\nwithout U (1)R symmetry. Using metastable minima, we\nfind a class of phenomenologically successful models without any elementary gauge singlet fields. We find the simplicity and generality of the models quite remarkable.\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. DOE\nunder Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098, and in part by the\nNSF under grant PHY-04-57315.
