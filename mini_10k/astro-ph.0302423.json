We investigate the two extreme cases of galaxy growth by\nequal mass merging and accretion of small stellar systems; in a subset of simulations\nwe also consider the presence of dark matter halos around the merging galaxies. Curiously, we found that the Fundamental Plane is preserved by major merging, while\nin the accretion scenario its edge\u2013on thickness is only marginally reproduced, with\nsubstantial thickening in the case of merging with low angular momentum. We also\nfound that both the Faber-Jackson and Kormendy relations are not reproduced by\nthe simulations, in accordance with the results of a preliminary analysis based on a\nsimple application of the virial theorem. Finally, we discuss the implications of our\nresults for the origin of the MBH -\u03c30 and Magorrian relations. We found that dissipationless merging is unable to reproduce the MBH -\u03c30 relation, if the black hole masses\nadd linearly (while the Magorrian relation is nicely reproduced); on the contrary a\nblack hole merging with substantial emission of gravitational waves reproduces the\nMBH -\u03c30 relation but fails at reproducing the Magorrian relation. We argue that our\nresults strongly point towards a major role of dissipation in the formation of early\u2013type\ngalaxies and in the growth of their central supermassive black holes, thus supporting\nthe idea of a link between galaxy formation and QSO activity.\nKey words:\ngalaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD \u2013 galaxies: formation \u2013 galaxies: kinematics and\ndynamics \u2013 galaxies: fundamental parameters \u2013 black hole physics\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTwo distinct scenarios have been proposed to describe the\nformation of elliptical galaxies (Es): roughly speaking, according to the monolithic scenario Es form at high redshift in dissipative collapses (see, e.g., Eggen, Lynden-Bell &\nSandage 1962, Larson 1975), while in the hierarchical merging scenario spheroidal systems are the end\u2013products of several merging processes of smaller galaxies, the last major\nmerger taking place in relatively recent times, i.e. at z <\n\u223c1\n(see, e.g., White & Rees 1978, Kauffmann 1996, Cole et\nal. 2000). In particular, this second picture is supported by\nsome observational data suggesting that a fraction of red\ngalaxies in clusters at intermediate redshift are undergoing\nmerging processes: these galaxies could be the progenitors of\npresent\u2013day early\u2013type galaxies (van Dokkum et al. 1999).\nIn any case, it is well known that Es satisfy many scaling\nc 2003 RAS\n\nrelations (more or less tight) that must be accounted for by\nany proposed formation scenario: for example the Faber\u2013\nJackson relation (hereafter FJ, Faber & Jackson 1976), the\nKormendy relation (Kormendy 1977), the Mg2 -\u03c30 relation\n(see, e.g., Burstein et al. 1988, Bender, Burstein & Faber\n1993) the color\u2013magnitude relation (Bower, Lucey & Ellis\n1992), and the very tight Fundamental Plane (hereafter FP;\nDjorgovski & Davis 1987, Dressler et al. 1987). In addition, it\nis now widely accepted that central supermassive black holes\n(hereafter BHs) are a common characteristic of spheroidal\nstellar systems (see, e.g., Kormendy & Richstone 1995, van\nder Marel 1999, de Zeeuw 2001); it has also been found that\ntheir mass (MBH ) is linearly proportional to the mass of\nthe host spheroid (Magorrian et al. 1998), and it is even\nmore correlated with the spheroid central stellar velocity\ndispersion (Gebhardt et al. 2000, Ferrarese & Merritt 2000).\nDue to their relevance in this work, here we briefly review\n\n\f2\n\nC. Nipoti, P. Londrillo and L. Ciotti\n\nthe main properties of the FP, FJ, Kormendy and MBH -\u03c30\nrelations.\nThe FP of Es is a scaling relation between three of their\nbasic observational\u221aproperties, namely the circularized effective radius hRie \u2261 ae be (where ae and be are the major and\nminor semi-axis of the effective isophotal ellipse), the central velocity dispersion \u03c30 , and the mean effective surface\nbrightness hIie \u2261LB /2\u03c0hRie 2 (where LB is the luminosity of\nthe galaxy, for example in the Johnson B-band). A parameterization of the FP, that we adopt in this paper, has been\nintroduced by Bender, Burstein & Faber (1992, hereafter\nBBF), by defining the three variables\nk1 \u2261\n\nlog \u03c302 + loghRie\n\u221a\n,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nk2 \u2261\n\nlog \u03c302 + 2 loghIie \u2212 loghRie\n\u221a\n,\n6\n\n(2)\n\nk3 \u2261\n\nlog \u03c302 \u2212 loghIie \u2212 loghRie\n\u221a\n.\n3\n\n(3)\n\nIn particular, when projected on the (k1 , k3 ) plane, the FP\nis seen almost edge\u2013on and it is considerably thin, while the\ndistribution of galaxies in the (k1 , k2 ) plane is broader. For\nexample, Virgo ellipticals studied by BBF are distributed on\nthe (k1 , k3 ) plane according to the best\u2013fit relation\nk3 = 0.15k1 + 0.36,\n\n(4)\n\u22121\n\n\u22122\n\n(when adopting respectively, kpc, km s and LB\u2299 pc as\nlength, velocity and surface brightness units), with a very\nsmall 1-\u03c3 dispersion of rms(k3 ) \u2243 0.05 over the whole range\nspanned by the data, 2.6 <\n\u223c 1.05). This\n\u223c 4.6 (0.75 <\n\u223c k3 <\n\u223c k1 <\ntranslates in a scatter of \u2243 15% in hRie for fixed LB and \u03c30 .\nThe slope and the scatter of equation (4) are usually called\n\"tilt\" and \"thickness\" of the FP, respectively. By combining\nequations (1) and (3) with equation (4) the FP relation is\nobtained in terms of the observables, and is in good agreement with the FP derived (in the same photometric band\nand for a much larger galaxy sample) by J\u00f8rgensen, Franx\n& Kjaergaard (1996)\u22c6 .\nStrictly related to the FP are the less tight FJ and Kormendy relations. These scaling relations have been often interpreted just as projections of the FP with no additional information, and, for this reason, their constraining power on\ngalaxy formation scenarios has been underestimated. However this is misleading, because these two relations describe\nhow Es are distributed on the FP and so, even if characterized by a larger scatter than the edge\u2013on view of the FP,\nthey contain important information on the galactic properties. The proposed original form of the FJ relation was\nLB \u221d \u03c30n , with n \u2248 4, while Davies et al. (1983) found that\nthe double\u2013slope fit\nLB\n1011 LB\u2299\n\n\u2243 0.23\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c30\n300 km s\u22121\n\n\u00112.4\n\n+0.62\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c30\n300 km s\u22121\n\n\u00114.2\n\n(5)\n\nprovides a better description of the data. Note that for small\n\u22121\ngalaxies and bulges (\u03c30 <\n\u223c 170 km s ) the exponent is \u223c 2.4,\n\u22c6 As it is well known, the FP tilt depends on the adopted photometric band. Curiously, when using the k-space, the coefficient\nin the K-band is only slightly different from 0.15, with a reported\nvalue of 0.147 (Pahre, Djorgovski & de Carvalho 1998b).\n\nconsiderably smaller than 4; this situation is also reflected\nby the fit of Dressler et al. (1987) to the galaxies of Virgo\ncluster, LB \u221d \u03c303.5 . Due to indeterminacy of the exact value\nof n, in the rest of the paper we use 3.5 and 4 as representative values of the FJ exponent.\nThe total luminosity of spheroidal systems also correlates with their length scale as measured by hRie : in fact,\nthe Kormendy relation can be written in the form\nhRie \u221d LaB ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the exponent a is strongly dependent on the galaxy\nsample used, and is found in the range 0.88 <\n\u223ca<\n\u223c 1.62\n(Ziegler et al. 1999). The latest estimates seem to converge to a value a \u223c 0.7 or less, as a function of waveband\n(Bernardi et al. 2003).\nIn the last years, another important scaling relation has\nbeen added to the list, the so\u2013called MBH -\u03c30 relation (see,\ne.g., Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Merritt\n& Ferrarese 2001, Tremaine et al. 2002):\nMBH \u221d \u03c30\u03b1 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c30 is the projected central velocity dispersion of the\nparent galaxies (or within hRie ), and the exact value of \u03b1\nis still matter of debate, ranging between 4 and 5. An important characteristic of this relation is its extremely small\nscatter, consistent with measurements errors only, so that\nequation (7) can be considered a \"perfect\" relation.\nIn the context of galaxy formation studies, a natural\nquestion to ask is how well dissipationless merging is able\nto produce and maintain these relations. We focus on dissipationless merging since it is simpler to be modeled with\nrespect to gas rich merging, and because in this way we can\ncheck whether the contribution of gas dissipation is required\nin the merging scenario of Es formation. In addition, the\nanalysis of dissipationless merging should indicate whether\nthe merging between gas poor systems observed at z < 1\n(van Dokkum et al. 1999) is a common phenomenon in Es\nlifetime, or a rare event. Among others, existence of serious\nproblems encountered by the picture of Es formation mainly\ndriven by dissipationless merging to reproduce their scaling\nrelations was pointed out by Ciotti & van Albada (2001;\nhereafter CvA). In their phenomenological approach, just by\ncombining the observed (edge\u2013on) FP and the MBH -\u03c30 relations, they demonstrated that in a dissipationless merging\nscenario, and under reasonable assumptions for the addition\nof BH masses during the merging, elliptical galaxies forced\nto lie on the FP and to satisfy the MBH -\u03c30 relation would\nhave effective radii exceedingly larger than those observed\nin real Es.\nHere we follow a complementary approach, and the\nmain goal is verifying, by using high resolution N-body numerical simulations of one and two\u2013component galaxy models, whether the end\u2013products of merging of galaxies, initially lying on the FP, lie on the FP (as well as on the other\nscaling relations) or they fail in some other respect (see also\nPentericci, Ciotti & Renzini 1995; Capelato, de Carvalho\n& Carlberg 1995; Bekki 1998; Evstigneeva, Reshetnikov &\nSotnikova 2002; Nipoti, Londrillo & Ciotti 2003a).\nNumerical simulations are needed since, owing to possible structural and/or dynamical non\u2013homology and to projection effects, one cannot predict with simple theoretical\narguments how \u03c30 and hRie evolve as consequence of mergc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fGalaxy merging, the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies, and the MBH -\u03c30 relation\ning: however, rough indications on their behavior can be\nderived from the study of the evolution of the virial velocity\ndispersion \u03c3V and the virial radius rV \u2020 . In fact, as a consequence of the virial theorem and the conservation of the\ntotal energy, in the merging of two galaxies with masses M1\nand M2 and virial velocity dispersions \u03c3V,1 and \u03c3V,2 , the\nvirial velocity dispersion of the resulting galaxy (in case of\nno mass loss and negligible kinetic and interaction energies\nof the galaxy pair when compared to their internal energies)\nis given by\n2\n\u03c3V,1+2\n=\n\n2\n2\nM1 \u03c3V,1\n+ M2 \u03c3V,2\n.\nM1 + M2\n\nmass galaxies are involved at each step of the hierarchy, and\nthe case of accretion, in which a massive galaxy increases\nits mass by incorporating smaller galaxies: the evolution of\nmore realistic, \"mixed\" merging histories should be bracketed by our simulations. This paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2 we describe the properties of the galaxy models and the adopted numerical methods. In Section 3 we\npresent the results, while in Section 4 we specifically discuss\nthe consequences of the findings on the implications for the\nMBH -\u03c30 relation. Finally, in Section 5 the main conclusions\nare summarized.\n\n(8)\n\nIt follows that \u03c3V,1+2 \u2264 max(\u03c3V,1 , \u03c3V,2 ), i.e., the virial velocity dispersion cannot increase in a merging process of the\nkind described above. Under the same hypotheses, the virial\nradius rV,1+2 of the resulting galaxy is given by\nM12\nM2\n(M1 + M2 )2\n=\n+ 2 ,\nrV,1+2\nrV,1\nrV,2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere rV,1 and rV,2 are the virial radii of the progenitors.\nIdentity (9) implies that\nrV,1+2 \u2265 min(rV,1 , rV,2 ), i.e., the virial radius cannot decrease in a merging process of the kind described above.\nFrom equations (8) and (9) it follows that, in the highly\nidealized scenario of a merging hierarchy based on identical,\none\u2013component seed galaxies characterized by \u03c3V,0 , rV,0 and\nM0 , we expect \u03c3V = \u03c3V,0 and rV = (M/M0 )rV,0 , independently of the merging sequence. Thus, by qualitatively assuming that \u03c30 \u223c \u03c3V and hRie \u223c rV , one should conclude\nthat the FJ and Kormendy relations are not consistent with\nthe scenario depicted above. Now, it is well known that for a\nlarge variety of mass models there is a good correlation between rM (the half\u2013mass radius of the galaxy, strictly related\nto hRie ) and rV , with the proportionality constant showing\nlittle dependence on the particular density profile\u2021 (see, e.g.,\nSpitzer 1969, Ciotti 1991), and so, even in presence of structural non\u2013homology in the merging end\u2013products, the \"prediction\" of a linear growth of hRie with M should be quite\nrobust. A more problematic situation (that can be properly\naddressed only with numerical simulations) arises when considering the relation between \u03c3V and \u03c30 : at variance with\nrM /rV , structural non\u2013homology can strongly affect the ratio \u03c30 /\u03c3V (see, e.g., Ciotti, Lanzoni & Renzini 1996; Bertin,\nCiotti & Del Principe 2002). In addition, a systematic variation of orbital anisotropy with mass (the so\u2013called dynamical non\u2013homology) can produce an increasing \u03c30 even at\nconstant \u03c3V (although Nipoti, Londrillo & Ciotti 2002, hereafter NLC02, showed that the whole tilt of the FP cannot\nbe ascribed to orbital anisotropy effects only).\nHere, with the aid of high\u2013resolution N-body simulations of one and two\u2013component galaxy models, we investigate the effect of subsequent generations of merging on the\ngalaxy scaling relations. Our study explore two extreme situations, namely the case of major merging, in which equal\n\n2\n\nNUMERICAL METHODS\n\n2.1\n\nGalaxy models\n\nAs initial conditions for the first generation of merging we\nuse spherically symmetric one and two\u2013component Hernquist density distributions (Hernquist 1990; Ciotti 1996,\n1999). This choice is motivated by the fact that the Hernquist model is both a reasonable approximation (when projected) of the R1/4 law (de Vaucouleurs 1948), and it is also\nsimilar to the Navarro, Frenk & White (1996) profile, thus\nproviding a sufficiently realistic description of the galaxy\nstellar and dark matter (DM) density distributions. The\ndensity, mass, and (relative) potential profiles of the stellar component of the Hernquist model are given by\n\u03c1\u2217 (r) =\n\n\u2020 By definition in a one\u2013component galaxy \u03c32 \u2261 2T /M and\nV\nrV \u2261 \u2212GM 2 /U , where T and U are the total kinetic and the\ngravitational energy of the galaxy, respectively.\n\u2021 For example in truncated power\u2013law spherical models r /r =\nV M\n1\n2 3\u2212\u03b3 (5 \u2212 2\u03b3)/(3 \u2212 \u03b3) and so 2 \u2264 rV /rM <\n\u223c2.1 for 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 2.\n\n1\nM\u2217 rc\n,\n2\u03c0 r(rc + r)3\n\nM\u2217 (r)\n=\nM\u2217\n\u03a8\u2217 (r) =\n\n\u0010\n\nr\nrc + r\n\n\u00112\n\n(10)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nGM\u2217\n,\nrc + r\n\n(12)\n\nwhere M\u2217 is the total stellar mass.

At variance with the models used in\nNLC02, here we restrict to globally isotropic models: the\ndistribution function (DF) of the stellar component is then\ngiven by\n1\nd\nf\u2217 (E ) = \u221a\n8\u03c0 2 dE\n\nZ\n\nE\n\n0\n\nd\u03a8T\nd\u03c1\u2217\n\u221a\n,\nd\u03a8T E \u2212 \u03a8T\n\n(13)\n\nwhere E = \u03a8T \u2212 v 2 /2 is the relative (positive) energy, v is\nthe modulus of the velocity vector, and \u03a8T = \u03a8\u2217 + \u03a8h is\nthe relative total potential; an analogous identity holds for\nthe DM halo, where \u03c1h substitutes \u03c1\u2217 .\nAccording to the given definitions, the one\u2013component\nmodels are completely determined by the two physical scales\nM\u2217 and rc , and in the numerical simulations M\u2217 , rc and Tdyn\nare adopted as mass, length and time scales.

In order to transform\nthe results of the numerical simulations in physical units we\nexpress M\u2217 in 1010 M\u2299 , rc in kpc, LB in 1010 LB\u2299 , and the\nconstant stellar mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio \u03a5\u2217 \u2261 M\u2217 /LB in solar\nunits. For a detailed description of the numerical realization\nof the initial conditions, see Section 2.1.3 of NLC02.\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nInitial conditions\nEqual mass merging\n\nThe first generation of the equal mass merging hierarchy is\nobtained by merging a pair of identical, spherically symmetric and isotropic Hernquist models (the \"zeroth order\" seed\ngalaxies), while the successive generations are obtained by\nmerging pairs of identical systems obtained by duplicating\nthe end\u2013product of the previous step. We followed the evolution of the hierarchy of 5 steps of head\u2013on mergers (that\nwould correspond, in absence of mass escape, to a mass increase of a factor 32); we also explored 3 steps of the head\u2013on\nmerging hierarchy whose seed galaxies are two\u2013component\nHernquist models (in which we assume a DM halo more\nmassive, \u03bc = 3, and less concentrated, \u03b2 = 2, than the\nstellar component), and, finally, 3 steps of the hierarchy of\nencounters of one\u2013component models with non zero (orbital)\nangular momentum.\nIn the assignment of the initial conditions for the head\u2013\non encounters the two galaxies are initially placed on an\norbit characterized by vanishing relative energy and angular\nmomentum, i.e., they would have a null relative velocity\nwhile at infinite relative distance. In practice, at the time\nt = 0, we place the two galaxies at a distance drel \u2243 3hri90\n(where hri90 is the angle\u2013averaged radius enclosing the 90%\nof the total mass M of each galaxy), and, neglecting the\neffects due to tidal forces, we assign to their\np centers of mass a\nrelative velocity with modulus vrel = 2 GM/drel . The end\u2013\nproducts of each merging are non\u2013spherical, and so, when\nexploring a successive merging, their mutual orientation at\nthe beginning of the new simulation is randomly assigned.\nIn the simulations with orbital angular momentum, we still\nconsider vanishing relative energy and drel defined as above,\nand we assume as impact parameter the sum of the angle\u2013\naveraged half\u2013mass radii of the merging galaxies.\n2.2.2\n\nand 10, respectively. As in the case of equal mass merging\nsimulations, the relative initial positions and velocities of the\ninfalling satellite and of the test galaxy are chosen so that\nat t = 0 they are on parabolic orbit, and the mutual orientation of the two galaxies is assigned randomly. In practice,\nas initial relative distance we adopt drel \u2243 hri90,1 + 2hri90,2 ,\nwhere the subscript 2 refers to the smaller galaxy. Again, in\ncase of non zero angular momentum, the impact parameter\nis given by the sum of the angle\u2013averaged half\u2013mass radii.\n\nAccretion\n\nIn the case of the merging hierarchy in which the test galaxy\ngrows by accretion of smaller systems (accretion), the seed\ngalaxy is a one-component Hernquist model, and the first\nmerging event is identical to that in the equal mass merging\ncase. In the second step, however, the first end\u2013product (of\nmass \u223c 2M\u2217 ) merges again with a seed galaxy, and so on. As\na consequence, the mass ratio between the infalling stellar\nsystem and the test galaxy decreases approximately as 1/n,\nwhere n is the step in the accretion hierarchy. Due to the\nhigher computational cost required by accretion simulations\nwith respect to equal mass merging in order to reach the\nsame mass increase, in the former case we limit to 15 steps\n(of head\u2013on merging) and to 9 steps (of merging with angular momentum), for a putative mass increase of a factor 16\n\n2.3\n\nThe numerical code\n\nFor the simulations we used a new, fast and accurate,\nparallel N-body code. Recently, a numerical scheme has\nbeen introduced to simulate collisionless N-body systems\nby Dehnen (2000, 2002), with a substantial improvement\nin force computation over standard tree\u2013based codes. By\ncombining in an original way the Fast Multipole Algorithm\n(see, e.g., Greengard & Rokhlin 1987, 1997) with the Barnes\n& Hut (1986) tree data structure, Dehnen scheme achieves\nexact momentum conservation with an effective O(N ) oper5\national complexity (for particle numbers N >\n\u223c10 ).\nBy taking advantage of these improvements, we have\nimplemented the Dehnen fast force solver (FalcON) in a\nparallel Fortran-90 N-body code named FVFPS (Fortran\nVersion of a Fast Poisson Solver; Londrillo, Nipoti & Ciotti\n2003). The FVFPS code is based on domain decomposition,\nand uses the MPI routines for data communication. A mass\ndependent opening parameter \u03b8 = \u03b8(M ), that assures faster\nperformances and a more uniform error distribution, is also\nemployed (Dehnen 2002). Time integration is performed by\na standard leap-frog algorithm, with (uniform) time step \u2206t\ndetermined adaptively. Thanks to effective O(N ) scaling of\nthe force computations, the FVFPS code assures a speed-up\nof a factor \u223c 10 over existing codes, in particular over the\nSpringel, Yoshida & White (2001) GADGET code. In the\npresent version, the FVFPS code is characterized by three\npreassigned parameters:\n(i) The minimum value of the opening parameter \u03b8min ,\nassociated with the total mass. We adopt \u03b8min = 0.5, resulting in mean relative force errors of \u223c 0.3%, and 99 percentile\nerrors of \u223c 3%.\n(ii) The softening parameter \u03b5 (i.e., the softening length\nexpressed in units of rc ), dependent, according to literature\nindications (e.g., Merritt 1996, Athanassoula et al. 2000,\nDehnen 2001), on N and on the specific density distribution profile.\n(iii) For the initial time step we assume \u2206t \u223c Tdyn /100.\nThe time step is allowed to vary adaptively as a function of\nthe maximum particle density, but is kept the same for all\nthe particles.\nFor the stellar distribution of the seed galaxies we use\nas a rule N\u2217 = 16378 particles for each galaxy, and in\nthe two\u2013component cases the DM distribution is made of\nNDM = 49152 particles: with this choice, halo and stellar\nparticles have the same mass. As a consequence of the merging hierarchy, the number of particles in the simulations increases with the galaxy mass: in the final merging of (one\nand two\u2013component) equal mass systems and of the accretion scenario, the total number of particles involved is of the\norder of 5.2 \u00d7 105 and 2.6 \u00d7 105 , respectively.\nWe followed the dynamical evolution of each merging\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fGalaxy merging, the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies, and the MBH -\u03c30 relation\n\nFigure 1.

In\nthe following we call \"end\u2013product\" of a simulation the system made of bound particles after the virialization. For the\ndetermination of the intrinsic and \"observational\" properties of the end\u2013products, we followed the same procedure\ndescribed in NLC02. In particular we measured the end\u2013\nproduct intrinsic axis ratios c/a and b/a (where a, b and\nc are the major, intermediate and minor axis of the associated inertia ellipsoid), their virial velocity dispersion \u03c3V\nand angle\u2013averaged half\u2013mass radius rM , and, for several\nprojection angles, the end-product circularized effective radius hRie , the central velocity dispersion \u03c30 , and the mean\neffective surface brightness hIie (obtained from the stellar\nmass profile by assuming a constant stellar mass\u2013to\u2013light\nratio \u03a5\u2217 ). In particular, the central velocity dispersion \u03c30 is\nobtained by averaging the projected velocity dispersion over\nthe circularized surface brightness profile within a radius of\nhRie /8. As a general rule we find that discreteness effects on\nthe derived values of hRie and \u03c30 do not exceed 1 \u00f7 2% at\neach projection angle.\nWe checked the reliability of the numerical simulations by running a few merging events both with the parallel version of GADGET (with \u03b1 = 0.02, \u2206tmin = 0,\n\u2206tmax = Tdyn /100, \u03b1tol = 0.05, and \u03b5 = 0.05 ;see Springel\net al. 2001 for details) and with our FVFPS code (with\n\u03b8min = 0.5, \u03b5 = 0.05 and \u2206t = Tdyn /100). The results\nare in remarkable agreement: the end\u2013products in threedimensional shape, angle\u2013averaged half\u2013mass radius, density and velocity dispersion profiles are practically indistinc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

In general,\nthe end\u2013products are triaxial systems with axis ratios in the\nrange 0.5 <\n\u223c c/a <\n\u223c 0.7 and 0.7 <\n\u223c b/a <\n\u223c 0.8 (where a, b and c\nare the major, intermediate and minor axis, respectively),\nin accordance with observed ellipticities of Es. For comparison with real galaxies, we also fitted (over the radial range\n0.1 <\n\u223c 10) the projected stellar mass density profile\n\u223c R/hRie <\nof the end\u2013products with the Sersic (1968) R1/m law:\n\n\u0014\n\nR\nI(R) = I0 exp \u2212b(m)\nRe\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00111/m \u0015\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere b(m) \u2243 2m\u22121/3+4/405m (Ciotti & Bertin 1999), and\nin Fig. 2 we plot the best fit parameter m as a function of the\ntotal mass of the systems, for one\u2013component (solid squares\nand triangles) and two\u2013component (stars) models. Clearly,\n\n\f6\n\nC. Nipoti, P. Londrillo and L. Ciotti\n\nthe fitted quantities m and hRie depend on the relative orientation of the line\u2013of\u2013sight and of the end\u2013products of the\nsimulations: the two points for each value of the mass in Fig.\n2 show the range of values spanned by m when projecting\nthe final states along the shortest and longest axis of their\ninertia ellipsoids. We note that higher values of the best fit\nparameter m correspond to more massive systems, a trend\nsimilar to that observed in Es\u00a7 (see, e.g., Caon, Capaccioli &\nD'Onofrio 1993, Prugniel & Simien 1997, Bertin et al. 2002).\nNote also that the values of m are in the same range obtained\nfrom observations, in fact we found 2 <\n\u223cm<\n\u223c 11. (However, as\npointed out to us by the Referee, from Fig. 2 one could argue that m \u2248 4 galaxies should have experienced at most\none major merger event in their life.)\nFollowing the discussion in the Introduction, in Fig. 3\n(top panel) we show the relation between the virial velocity dispersion and the total stellar mass of the mergers at\neach step of the merging hierarchy. In one\u2013component models (solid squares and triangles) a modest increase of \u03c3V\nwith M\u2217 is apparent: for the last model in the hierarchy the\nmass is increased by a factor \u223c 24.5 (instead of the maximum possible value of 32), while the \u03c3V is increased by a\nfactor \u223c 1.16 only. This small increase of \u03c3V with respect\nto the expectation of equation (8) (i.e., \u03c3V = const) can be\nexplained with a simple generalization of the highly idealized situation formalized there. In fact, if during a merging\nbetween two galaxies with mass M1 , M2 and virial velocity\ndispersion \u03c3V,1 , \u03c3V,2 a mass \u2206M is lost with mean velocity\nvej , then the virial velocity dispersion of the end\u2013product\n\u03c3V,1+2 is expected to be\n2\n\u03c3V,1+2\n=\n\n2\n2\n2\nM1 \u03c3V,1\n+ M2 \u03c3V,2\n+ \u2206M vej\n:\nM1 + M2 \u2212 \u2206M\n\n(17)\n\nin particular \u03c3V increases as a consequence of the mass (and\nassociated kinetic energy) loss. We found that in the simulations the mass lost during each merging never exceeds\n\u2206M/(M1 + M2 ) \u2243 0.06 and, consistently, the corresponding\nincrease of \u03c3V is 2 \u00f7 5% (Fig. 3, top panel).\nIn Fig. 3 (bottom panel) we plot the half\u2013mass radius\nas a function of the stellar mass of the mergers. As for \u03c3V ,\nalso for this quantity the simple virial expectation of a linear\ngrowth of rV (and of rM ) with M (dotted line) is apparent.\nThe \"jump\" from the initial condition position to the first\nmerger is due to the significant change in the galaxy density\nstructure (as revealed by the change of values of m in Fig.\n2); the successive generations of merging are characterized\nby more similar density profiles, and, correspondingly, the\npoints in Fig. 3 move parallel to the dotted line.\nHow does the presence of massive DM halos affect these\nresults? As anticipated, in this case we investigated 3 steps\nof the (head\u2013on) equal mass merging hierarchy by using\ntwo\u2013component galaxy models. Due to its observational relevance, we focus here on the description of the properties of\nthe stellar component only. As in the one\u2013component case,\nthe end\u2013products are triaxial, and with the axis ratios in\nthe same range. The best fit Sersic parameter m still in-\n\n\u00a7 Curiously, NLC02 found that in the case of end\u2013products of\nunstable galaxy models m decreases for increasing radial orbital\nanisotropy in the initial conditions. Note also that in NLC02 and\nLondrillo et al. 2003 we used a radial range 0.1 <\n\u223c R/hRie <\n\u223c 4.\n\ncreases with mass (stars in Fig. 2). In the two\u2013component\nsimulations, owing to the presence of the DM halo, there are\nnot arguments as simple as those used in equations (8), (9)\nand (17) in order to predict the effects of merging on \u03c3V\n(defined as 2T\u2217 /M\u2217 ) and rM of the stellar component. However, it is apparent from Figs. 2 and 3 that the presence of a\nDM halo or angular momentum in the initial conditions does\nnot modify the general trend of m, \u03c3V and rM at increasing\nmass.\n\n3.1.1\n\nFundamental Plane\n\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the results of equal mass merging simulations in the principal planes (k1 , k3 ) and (k1 , k2 ), where\none\u2013component galaxy models resulting from head\u2013on mergers and from merging with angular momentum are identified\nby solid squares and triangles, respectively; two\u2013component\nmodels are represented by stars. The progenitor of the merging hierarchy (the point without bar) is placed on the edge\u2013\non FP by choosing its luminosity LB = 3 \u00d7 109 LB\u2299 and\nstellar mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio \u03a5\u2217 = 5, so that equation (4),\nrepresented by the solid line, is satisfied. Consistently with\nthe adopted dissipationless scenario, the value of \u03a5\u2217 is kept\nconstant during the whole merging hierarchy. Due to the loss\nof spherical symmetry of the end\u2013products of the merging\nsimulations, their coordinates depend on the line\u2013of\u2013sight\ndirection; however, being the luminosity (mass) of each end\u2013\nproduct fixed, variations of k1 , k2 , k3 due to projection effects are not independent. In fact, the k1 and k3 coordinate\nof a galaxy of given luminosity are linearly dependent as\nk3 =\n\nr\n\n2\nk1 +\n3\n\nr\n\n2\u03c0\n1\n;\nlog\n3\nLB\n\n(18)\n\nthis dependence is reflected by the straight lines in Fig. 4\n(top panel), each of them representing the range spanned\nin the (k1 , k3 ) space by a given end\u2013product when observed\nover the solid angle. As in NLC02, in order to quantify the\ndeviation of a model from the FP, we use the vertical distance \u03b4k3 \u2261 |k3 \u2212 0.15k1 \u2212 0.36| from the point to the FP\nitself. It is interesting to note that for all the end\u2013products\nthe projection effects translate into a \u03b4k3 of the same order\nof magnitude of the observed FP dispersion. In addition it\nis also apparent from Fig. 4 how k3 and k1 increase with\nthe galaxy mass consistently with the observed FP tilt and\nthickness. Being \u03a5\u2217 fixed in our simulations, from Fig. 2\nwe conclude that one\u2013component equal mass dissipationless\nmerging is able to reproduce (basically by structural non\u2013\nhomology) the edge\u2013on FP of elliptical galaxies (see also\nCapelato et al. 1995).\nWe also explored the behavior of the models in the\n(k1 , k2 ) plane (Fig. 4, bottom panel), which represents the\nface\u2013on view of the FP; the region populated by real galaxies\nin this plane is identified by dashed lines. By fixing the scale\nlength, we place the first progenitor (with hRie \u2243 0.7 kpc)\nin a zone of the (k1 , k2 ) plane populated by low\u2013luminosity\nellipticals (k1 \u2243 3, k2 \u2243 4.5), and for each end\u2013product we\nplot the (k1 , k3 ) positions for a few random projection angles. Note that, at variance with the coordinates (k1 , k3 ),\nk1 and k2 are related (for a given end\u2013product) by an expression containing hRie besides LB , and for this reason in\nthe (k1 , k2 ) plane the effect of projection is to distribute the\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fGalaxy merging, the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies, and the MBH -\u03c30 relation\n\n7\n\nFigure 3.

One\u2013component\nequal mass mergers (solid squares and triangles) are moved\nby merging towards the bottom right of the (k1 , k2 ) plane,\nroughly parallel to the line defining the zone of avoidance,\nin accordance with the prediction of BBF. The produced\ndisplacements are very large: it is remarkable that the end\u2013\nproducts of the last step of the hierarchy are found in a\nposition only marginally consistent with the populated region in the (k1 ,k2 ) space. It is also interesting to note that\nthe presence of substantial angular momentum in the initial conditions does not change significantly the properties\nof equal mass mergers, both in the (k1 ,k3 ) and in the (k1 ,k2 )\nplane.\nThe results of equal mass merging of two\u2013component\ngalaxies are represented in Fig. 4 with stars. Due to the\npresence of DM, in order to place the first progenitor (LB =\n3 \u00d7 109 LB\u2299 ) on the FP, we assumed a stellar mass\u2013to\u2013light\nratio \u03a5\u2217 = 2.3. It is apparent that both in the (k1 , k3 )\nand (k1 , k2 ) planes, the behavior of two\u2013component models does not significantly differ from the corresponding one\u2013\ncomponent models. In other words, dissipationless, equal\nmass merging of one and two\u2013component models seems to\nbe consistent with the existence of the FP of Es.\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n3.1.2\n\nFaber\u2013Jackson and Kormendy relations\n\nAs we have shown in the Section above, dissipationless merging of one and two\u2013component galaxy models is surprisingly\nconsistent with the existence of the FP, especially considering its small thickness when seen edge\u2013on. However, Es do\nfollow additional scaling relations as the FJ and Kormendy\nrelations, and so here we compare the results of our simulations with these scaling laws.\nThe solid line in the upper panel of Fig. 5 represents the\nFJ relation in the form LB \u221d \u03c304 together with its scatter\n(\u03b4log\u03c30 \u2243 0.1, Davies et al. 1983, dashed lines); the dotted line represents the steeper fit (LB \u221d \u03c303.5 ) derived by\nDressler et al. (1987). The end\u2013products of (head\u2013on) equal\nmass merging of one\u2013component galaxies (solid squares)\nhave a \u03c30 lower than that predicted by the FJ relation for\nthe given mass increase, and the discrepancy is stronger in\ncase of merging with angular momentum (solid triangles). It\nis interesting to compare this plot with the upper panel of\nFig. 3: it is then clear how the failure of FJ can be directly\ntraced to the constancy of \u03c3V and to the significant dynamical homology of the mergers. This latter point again suggest\nthat structural non\u2013homology, more than dynamical non\u2013\nhomology is at the origin of the FP in the explored merging\n\n\f8\n\nC. Nipoti, P. Londrillo and L.

Models with DM (stars in Fig. 5)\nseem to follow more closely the FJ relation, even though the\nrepresentative points show the same clear trend as the one\u2013\ncomponent merging hierarchy: it seems clear to us that additional simulations would bring also two\u2013component models\ncompletely outside the FJ relation.\nConsidering now the agreement with the FP on one\nside, and the failure at reproducing the FJ relation on the\nother side, we would expect that also the Kormendy relation is not reproduced by the equal mass merging hierarchy.\nIn fact, if we assume that the Es obey to the FJ relation,\nLB \u221d \u03c3 n , then from equation (4) we obtain a fiducial Kor1.225\u22122/n\nmendy relation hRie \u221d LB\n. For example, with n = 4\n(for which the exponent is remarkably near to that reported\nby Bernardi et al. 2003) the effective radius of the end\u2013\nproduct of the last equal mass merger is a factor \u223c 3 larger\nthan that predicted by the \"Kormendy\" relation. In other\nwords, the results of our simulations are characterized by too\nlarge effective radii (see Fig. 5, bottom panel). Thus, in the\nexplored equal mass merging hierarchies both \u03c30 and hRie\ndeviate systematically from the values expected from FJ and\nKormendy relations. Yet, their deviations from the two scalc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\ning laws curiously compensate reproducing the edge\u2013on FP;\nthis shows clearly that the FJ and Kormendy relations are\nnot simple projections of the FP, which is actually preserved\nby merging, but, despite their larger scatter, contain additional information on galaxy structure and dynamics.\n\n3.2\n\nAccretion\n\nIn Section 3.1 we showed that, in the case of equal mass\nmerging of one and two\u2013component galaxies, the virial expectations were qualitatively followed also by the observational properties hRie and \u03c30 , in addition to \u03c3V and rV . We\nrecall that these expectations are independent of the specific\nmerging history, as far as the zeroth order seed galaxies are\nidentical systems, and so we could consider \"accretion\" simulations superfluous. However, the amount of escaping particles or the non\u2013homology of the final end\u2013products could\ndepend on the mass ratio of the merging systems, thus resulting in substantial changes in \u03c3V and/or \u03c30 . Following\nthis argument we now present the results of accretion simulations, whose technical setting is described in Section 2.\nFrom the structural point of view, the end\u2013products of ac-\n\n\f10\n\nC. Nipoti, P. Londrillo and L. Ciotti\n\ncretion are less flattened than the corresponding (i.e. with\nthe same mass) equal mass mergers, being, in general, triaxial systems with axis ratios in the range 0.6 <\n\u223c c/a <\n\u223c 0.9, and\n<\n0.7 <\nb/a\n0.9,\nand\nbecoming\nmore\nand\nmore\nspherical\nwith\n\u223c\n\u223c\nincreasing mass as a consequence of the higher number of\nmerging events and the random direction of accretion. The\nevolution of the surface brightness profile in the accretion\nhierarchy is shown in Fig. 2, where the best fit Sersic parameter m is represented with empty circles and triangles\n(for head\u2013on merging and merging with angular momentum, respectively). A first relevant difference with the equal\nmass merging results is the decrease of m with mass at mass\nratios larger than 4 for the head\u2013on accretions, and the consequent smaller range of m (2 <\n\u223cm<\n\u223c 8) spanned by their\nend\u2013products. Therefore, the explored head\u2013on accretion\nscenario fails at reproducing the relation between the surface brightness profile shapes and luminosity of real galaxies,\nwhich are characterized by m increasing with galaxy luminosity and also spanning a larger range. A different situation\nis obtained when considering accretion simulations with non\nnegligible orbital angular momentum: the structural properties of the end\u2013products are curiously similar to the equal\nmass cases.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 3 we plot \u03c3V as a function of\nmass of also of the head\u2013on accretion end\u2013products (empty\ncircles). We found that the fraction of mass lost in each\nmerging \u2206M/(M1 + M2 ), decreases from \u223c 0.06 in the first\nstep to \u223c 0.01 in the last one, summing up to a total amount\nof mass lost over 15 steps of \u223c 18%, about the same value\nfound in the corresponding equal mass merging cases. The\nslightly larger increase of \u03c3V in the head\u2013on accretion hierarchy with respect to the equal mass merging cases is fully\naccounted for larger values of vej , in accordance with the\nestimate given in equation (17). In the lower panel of Fig.\n3 we also show the evolution of rM in the head\u2013on accretion hierarchy (empty circles). The behavior of this quantity is qualitatively similar to that of equal mass mergers:\nthe slightly flatter slope of the sequence with respect to the\nsimple expectation rM \u221d M is due to the stronger evolution\nof structural non\u2013homology, as revealed by Fig. 2. On the\nother hand, the end\u2013products of accretion simulations with\nangular momentum (empty triangles in Fig. 3) are more\nsimilar to equal mass merging case.\n3.2.1\n\nFundamental Plane\n\nThe most striking difference of the end\u2013products of head\u2013\non accretion simulations (empty circles) with respect to the\nequal mass merging hierarchy and also to accretion simulations with angular momentum (empty triangles) is apparent\nin the upper panel of Fig. 4, where the results are plotted\nin the (k1 , k3 ) space. In fact, after few accretions, the end\u2013\nproducts are characterized by a k3 decreasing for increasing\nk1 , at variance with the FP slope and the trend shown by\nthe end\u2013products of equal mass mergers. As a consequence,\nthe last explored models (corresponding to an effective mass\nincrease of a factor \u223c 12) are found at a distance \u03b4k3 larger\nthan the FP scatter. This result, when interpreted by using\nthe information in Fig. 2, is not surprising. In fact, being the\ncoordinate k3 a measure of non\u2013homology for galaxies with\nconstant \u03a5\u2217 (as those explored in this paper), the decrease\nof the Sersic parameter m at increasing mass (at variance\n\nwith real galaxies) reflects directly in the unrealistic trend in\nthe (k1 , k3 ) plane. On the contrary, in the face\u2013on (k1 , k2 )\nplane (Fig. 4, lower panel), the end\u2013products of accretion\n(both head\u2013on and with angular momentum) evolve along\nthe same direction followed by equal mass mergers, albeit\nwith a smaller excursion in k1 and k2 .\n3.2.2\n\nFaber\u2013Jackson and Kormendy relations\n\nIn Fig. 5 we also plot the results of accretion simulations in\nthe planes representing the FJ and the Kormendy relations.\nAt variance with the case of the edge\u2013on FP, and independently on the presence of angular momentum, the behavior\nof the end\u2013products is considerably similar to that of the\nequal mass mergings, i.e., both FJ and Kormendy relations\nare not reproduced. The end\u2013products have \u03c30 smaller and\nhRie larger than the values predicted by the two scaling relations for the given luminosity (mass) increase. However, a\ncloser inspection of Fig. 5 reveals that both \u03c30 and hRie are\nsystematically larger in the case equal mass mergers than\nin the case of head\u2013on accretion: in other words, the end\u2013\nproducts in the latter case deviate more from the FJ and\nless from the Kormendy than those in the former. The result\nrelative to the effective radius simply reflects the different\nevolution of the half\u2013mass radius in the two scenarios (see\nFig. 3, lower panel), while the behavior of \u03c30 depends both\non structural and dynamical non\u2013homology effects: the combined effect of the lower values of \u03c30 and the larger values of\nhRie is responsible of the decreasing of k3 with k1 observed\nin the analysis of the edge\u2013on FP. In other words, at variance with equal mass mergers and accretions with angular\nmomentum, there is not enough compensation between the\ntrends in \u03c30 and hRie able to reproduce the FP tilt in case\nof head\u2013on accretions.\n\n4\n\nDISSIPATIONLESS MERGING AND THE\nMBH -\u03c30 RELATION\n\nOn the basis of the results of the previous Section, it is\nparticularly interesting to investigate whether dissipationless merging is able to reproduce the MBH -\u03c30 relation, and\nwe attempt to answer this question by using the simulations\npresented in Section 3. Here we recall that in our simulations\nwe do not take into account the presence BH in the merging\ngalaxies, yet we argue that we can reach robust conclusions,\nand this for two reasons. In fact, as well known, at the equilibrium (i.e. after the virialization of the end\u2013product) the\npresence of the BH has not significant influence on \u03c30 . This\ncan easily be seen by considering that the sphere of influence\nof a BH with mass MBH at the center of a galaxy with central\nvelocity dispersion \u03c30 has a fiducial radius rBH \u2261 GMBH /\u03c302 ,\nand combining this equation with equation (7) we obtain\nrBH \u2243 0.01 \u00d7\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c30\n200 km s\u22121\n\n\u0011\u03b1\u22122\n\nkpc,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere we assumed MBH = 108 M\u2299 when \u03c30 = 200 km s\u22121\n(see, e.g., Tremaine et al. 2002). The central velocity dispersion used in the definition of the FP and of the MBH -\u03c30\nrelations is the luminosity weighted projected velocity dispersion inside the radius hRie /8 which, for ellipticals with\n\u03c30 \u2243 200 km s\u22121 , is in the range 0.2 <\n\u223c hRie /8 <\n\u223c 0.6 kpc,\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fGalaxy merging, the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies, and the MBH -\u03c30 relation\n\n11\n\nFigure 6.

The points correspond to the mean value over the solid angle, while the bars\nindicate the range spanned by projection effects.

Thus, once the numerical end\u2013products reached the equilibrium, their \u03c30 is a\ngood estimate of the real quantity even in presence of a BH\nof realistic mass. The second reason requires a more careful\ndiscussion. In fact, during the dynamical evolution of the\nmerging system, a BH binary is formed and, in principle, its\nevolution could affect the kinematic properties of the end\u2013\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\nproduct even beyond rBH . However Milosavljevic & Merritt\n(2001), with the aid of numerical simulations, showed that\nthe formation of a BH binary does not modify significantly\nthe central velocity dispersion measured within the standard\naperture hRie /8, although the inner density profile is modified (for interesting observational evidences of this case see\nLauer et al. 2002). In any case, we remark here that, if any,\n\n\f12\n\nC. Nipoti, P. Londrillo and L. Ciotti\n\nthe expected effect of binary BHs is to decrease the central\nvelocity dispersion, as a consequence of dynamical friction\nheating against background stars.\nOn the basis of these considerations we simply assume\nthat each seed galaxy contains a BH of mass MBH,0 , and that\neach merging end\u2013product contains a BH obtained by the\nmerging of the BHs of the progenitors (at the end of this Section, however, we will discuss two important problem faced\nby this last assumption). Unfortunately, BH merging is still\na poorly understood physical process, in particular with respect to the amount of emitted gravitational waves (see, e.g.,\nCvA, and references therein), and for this reason we consider\ntwo extreme situations: the case of classical combination of\nmasses (MBH,1+2 = MBH,1 + MBH,2 , with no emission as\ngravitational waves), and the case of maximally efficient ra2\n2\n2\ndiative merging (MBH,1+2\n= MBH,1\n+ MBH,2\n, corresponding\nto entropy conservation in a merging of two non rotating\nBHs). Following this choice, in Fig. 6 we plot the central\nvelocity dispersion of the mergers versus the mass of their\ncentral BH in the case of classical (panel a) and maximally\nradiative (panel b) BH merging. As expected from the similarity between the FJ and the MBH -\u03c30 relations, in the classical case, both (one\u2013component) equal mass mergers (solid\nsquares and triangles) and accretion mergers (empty circles\nand triangles) are unable to reproduce the observed relation,\neven when its slope is assumed as high as 5, with representative points well outside the observed scatter (vertical dotted\nbars). As it happens for the FJ relation, the situation is\nsomewhat better when considering equal mass mergers of\ntwo\u2013component galaxy models: in presence of DM the stellar central velocity dispersion is higher for given BH mass\nand the end\u2013products are found closer to the observed relation (stars in Fig. 6). Thus, as for the FJ, the reason of the\nfailure of dissipationless merging at reproducing the MBH \u03c30 relation is that the end\u2013products are characterized by a\ntoo low \u03c30 for the given MBH , i.e., MBH is too high for the\nresulting \u03c30 . A promising solution to this problem could be\nthe emission of some fraction of MBH as gravitational waves.\nIn fact, by assuming maximally efficient radiative BH merging, the points are found remarkably closer to the observed\nrelation, even if it is apparent that the slope of the MBH \u03c30 relation is not well reproduced by the end\u2013products of\nhead\u2013on accretion (empty circles). Note however that, while\nin the classical scenario the Magorrian relation is (obviously)\nnicely reproduced (Fig. 6), in case of substantial emission of\ngravitational waves the relation between BH mass and bulge\nmass is not reproduced (Fig. 6).\nAll the results presented in this Section holds under\nthe strong assumption that the BHs of the merging galaxies are retained by the end\u2013products, but there at least two\nbasic mechanisms that could be effective in expelling the\ncentral BHs. The first is related to the general instability\nof three body systems: if a third galaxy is accreted by the\nend\u2013product of a previous merging before the binary BH\nat its center merged in a single BH, then the escape of the\nsmallest BH is highly possible. It is clear that if this process\nhappens more than a few times, then the Magorrian relation\nwill be not preserved at the end. A plausible solution to this\nproblem is then to assume that the characteristic time of BH\nmerging (first by dynamical friction on the background stars\nand then by emission of gravitational waves) is shorter than\nthe characteristic time between two galaxy merging (for a\n\ndetailed discussion of this problem see, e.g., Milosavljevic &\nMerritt 2001, Yu 2002, Haehnelt & Kauffmann 2002, Volonteri, Haardt & Madau 2003). However, a second physical\nmechanism could be more effective in expelling the resulting\nBH from the center of a galaxy merger, i.e., anisotropic emission of gravitational waves. This process, commonly known\nas the \"kick velocity\", is directly related to the fraction of\nBH mass emitted anisotropically during the BH coalescence\n(see, e.g., Flanagan & Hughes 1998, CvA). Gravitational\nwaves in fact travel at the velocity of light, and so even\nthe anisotropic emission of a few thousandths of the mass of\nthe BH binary will produce a recoil (due to linear momentum conservation) of the resulting BH with a characteristic\nvelocity higher than the escape velocity typical of massive\ngalaxies. In conclusion, it seems to us not trivial to assume\nthat in each galaxy merging the resulting BH will reside at\nthe center (see, e.g., Haehnelt & Kauffmann 2000).\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nAs outlined in the Introduction, the present study is similar,\nin some aspects, to previous studies concerning the effects of\nmerging on the FP. The results of our simulations are consistent with those of Capelato et al. (1995), based on N-body\nsimulations of King (1966) galaxy models, and of Dantas et\nal. (2003), based on Hernquist models, who found that the\nedge\u2013on FP is reproduced by dissipationless merging, owing to non\u2013homology of the end\u2013products. However, they\nconsidered only the first two or three steps of the merging hierarchy. In the same line of investigation, GonzalezGarcia & van Albada (2003) found that also the first generation of end\u2013products of dissipationless merging based on\nJaffe (1983) models preserves the FP when seen edge\u2013on.\nAt variance with these works, we used galaxy models with\na substantially larger number of particles, we explored the\ncumulative effects of several generations of merging, and we\nalso compared with other scaling laws, such as the FaberJackson, the Kormendy, and the MBH -\u03c30 relations.\nThe main results of our simulations can be summarized\nas follows:\n\u2022 The edge\u2013on FP is well reproduced by dissipationless\nhierarchical equal mass merging of one and two\u2013component\ngalaxy models, and by accretion simulations with substantial angular momentum, with their seed galaxies (i.e. the\nmerging zeroth order generation) placed on the FP itself. On\nthe contrary, in the case of head\u2013on accretion, the k3 coordinate decreases at increasing k1 , at variance with real galaxies. The physical reason of these different behavior is due\nto a different evolution of structural non\u2013homology of the\nend\u2013products in the two scenarios; in fact the Sersic best fit\nparameter m grows monotonically with mass in equal mass\nmergers (and accretion with angular momentum), while decreases with mass in head\u2013on accretion end\u2013products.\n\u2022 In both scenarios the scatter in the (k1 , k3 ) coordinates\nassociated to projection effects is of the order of the observed\n1-\u03c3 dispersion of the edge\u2013on FP.\n\u2022 At variance with the results of the edge\u2013on FP, all the\nresults of our simulations are in qualitative agreement when\nplotted in the (k1 , k2 ) plane, where the FP is seen nearly\nface\u2013on. In this plane the mergers move parallel to the line\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fGalaxy merging, the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies, and the MBH -\u03c30 relation\ndefining the zone of avoidance, and remain in the region of\nthe FP populated by real galaxies.\n\u2022 As a direct consequence of the numerical findings that\nthe \"observables\" \u03c30 and hRie follow closely the evolution\nof \u03c3V and rV as predicted by the virial theorem, the end\u2013\nproducts of our simulations fail to reproduce both the FJ\nand Kormendy relations. However, in the case of equal mass\nmerging and accretion merging with angular momentum,\nthe large values of hRie and the nearly constant values of \u03c30\ncuriously compensate, and the end\u2013products follow nicely\nthe edge\u2013on FP (see the first point above).\n\u2022 Under the reasonable hypothesis that the derived values of \u03c30 are not strongly affected by the dynamical evolution of binary BHs, our results show that dissipationless\nmerging, while in accordance with the Magorrian relation,\nfails to reproduce the MBH -\u03c30 relation. We have then shown\nthat, allowing for substantial emission of gravitational waves\nduring the BHs coalescence, the MBH -\u03c30 relation is surprisingly reproduced, but the Magorrian relation is not. Merging\nby head\u2013on accretion suffers of an additional problem when\nconsidered together with the Magorrian relation: our simulations in fact showed that the best Sersic m parameter\ndecreases at increasing mass of the end\u2013product, a behavior\nopposite to what is empirically found (Graham et al. 2001).\nIn conclusion the results of the presented simulations\nsuggest that substantial dissipationless merging (especially\nwhen involving stellar systems of very different mass) cannot be the basic mechanism of formation of Es. We note,\nhowever, that our exploration of the parameter space is by\nno means complete, because in the simulations we did not\nconsider initial conditions corresponding to multiple merging. In any case, indications exist that our results should\nbe obtained also under these more general circumstances\n(Nipoti et al. 2003b). Finally, we note that from the numerical results one cannot exclude, on the basis of FP, FJ, and\nKormendy relations, that Es could experience few occasional\nmergings with other Es, even in recent times as observed by\nvan Dokkum et al. (1999). In any case, it is well known that\nmany other astrophysical evidences, based on stellar population properties, such as the Mg2 -\u03c30 and the color-magnitude\nrelations, and the waveband dependence of the relation between mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio and galaxy luminosity (see, e.g.,\nPahre et al. 1998b, Pahre, de Carvalho & Djorgovski 1998a),\nstrongly argue for a substantial dissipative phase in the formation of spheroids.\nIf we exclude dissipationless merging as the formation\nmechanism for Es, then we are left with two possible solutions, namely the monolithic scenario or a merging scenario\nwhere dissipation plays an important role. In this last case\nthe presented simulations can also say something. In fact\ngas dissipation should be effective in shrinking the density\ndistribution of the merging end\u2013products, and, at the same\ntime, increasing their central velocity dispersion, changes\nthat are in the direction required by the FJ and Kormendy\nrelations. In addition, in order to preserve the Magorrian\nrelation, a fraction of the star forming dissipating gas must\nflow on the central BH, producing QSO activity; in this case\nthe cosmological evolution of QSOs would be a tracer of the\nmerging history, in accordance with the old ages of stars\nin Es. As a consequence, numerical simulations of galaxy\nmerging in presence of gas (see, e.g., Bekki 1998), taking\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n13\n\nalso into account the feedback from the central BH in a selfconsistent way (see, e.g., Tabor & Binney 1993, Binney &\nTabor 1995, Ciotti & Ostriker 1997, 2001), and finally a better understanding of BH merging (see, e.g. Merritt & Ekers\n2002; Hughes & Blandford 2002) are highly needed for a\nsubstantial progress in this field.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nL.C. would like to thank Giuseppe Bertin, Piero Madau,\nJerry Ostriker, Silvia Pellegrini, Alvio Renzini and Tjeerd\nvan Albada for useful discussions.
