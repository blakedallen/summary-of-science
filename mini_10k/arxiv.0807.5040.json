DRANISHNIKOV, M. KATZ, AND YU. RUDYAK\n\n1. Systolic inequalities and LS category\nA quarter century ago, M. Gromov [Gr83] initiated the modern period in systolic geometry by proving a curvature-free 1-systolic lower\nbound for the total volume of an essential Riemannian manifold M of\ndimension d, i.e. a d-fold product of the systole is such a lower bound.\nHere the term \"curvature-free\" is used in the literature to refer to\na bound independent of curvature invariants, with a constant depending on the dimension (and possibly on the topology), but not on the\ngeometry (i.e. the Riemannian metric). Note that such bounds cannot\nbe called \"metric-independent\" as the systolic invariants themselves do\ndepend on the metric.\nRecently, M. Brunnbauer [Bru08c] proved that a (k \u2212 1)-connected\nmanifold of dimension n = kd satisfies a curvature-free stable k-systolic\ninequality (stsysk )d \u2264 C voln if and only if a purely homotopic condition on the image of the fundamental class [M] in a suitable classifying space is satisfied. Thus the total volume admits a lower bound\nin terms of a systolic product with d factors. J. Strom [St07] and\nthe first named author [D08] were motivated by investigations of the\nLusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category [DKR08] in its relation to systolic geometry [KR06]. A. Costa and M. Farber [CF08] have pursued\nthe direction initiated in [D08], as applied to motion planning\u2013related\ncomplexity.\nOur first result links systolic inequalities to the cohomological dimension (see [Bro94]) of the fundamental group, see Theorem 4.2 for\na more precise statement.\n1.1. Theorem. Let M be a closed n-manifold, with cd(\u03c01 M) = d \u2264 n.\nThen there can be no more than\nn+d\n2\nsystolic factors in a product which provides a curvature-free lower bound\nfor the total volume of M.\nIt was shown in [KR06, KR08] that the maximal number of factors\nin such a product coincides with the LS category catLS in a number of\ncases, including all manifolds of dimension \u2264 3. We apply Theorem 1.1\nto show that, in dimension 4, the number of factors is bounded by the\nLS category, see Corollary 5.3 for a more precise statement.\n1.2. Theorem. For every closed orientable 4-manifold, the maximal\nnumber of factors in a product of systoles which provides a curvaturefree lower bound for the total volume, is bounded above by catLS M.\n\n\fCOHOMOLOGICAL DIMENSION, SELF-LINKING, AND SYSTOLES\n\n3\n\nCombining Theorem 1.1 with a volume lower bound resulting from an\ninequality of Gromov's (see Sections 3 and 6), we obtain the following\nresult (typical examples are T2 \u00d7 S 3 as well as the non-orientable S 3 bundle over T2 ).\n1.3. Theorem. Let M be a closed 5-dimensional manifold. Assume\nthat b1 (M) = cd(\u03c01 M) = 2 and furthermore that the typical fiber of the\nAbel\u2013Jacobi map to T2 represents a nontrivial homology class. Then\nthe maximal possible number of factors in a systolic lower bound for\nthe total volume is 3. Note also that 3 \u2264 catLS M \u2264 4.\nThe above result motivates the following question concerning upper\nbounds for the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, cf. [D08].\n1.4. Question. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3, is the LusternikSchnirelmann category of M necessarily equal to 3?\nIt will be convenient to formulate all of the above results in terms of\nthe systolic category. The idea of systolic category is to codify lower\nbounds for the total volume, in terms of lower-dimensional systolic\ninvariants. We think of it as an elegant way of expressing systolic\nstatements. Here we wish to incorporate all possible curvature-free\nsystolic inequalities, stable or unstable. More specifically, we proceed\nas follows.\n1.5. Definition. Given k \u2208 N, k > 1 we set\n\b\nsysk (M, G) = inf syshk (M \u2032 , G; A), stsysk (M, G) ,\n\nwhere sysh is the homology systole, stsys is the stable homology systole,\nand the infimum is over all regular covering spaces M \u2032 of M, and over\nall choices\nA \u2208 {Z, Z2 }.\n(1.1)\nFurthermore, we define\nsys1 (M, G) = min{sys\u03c0 1 (M, G), stsys1 (M, G)}.\nNote that the systolic invariants thus defined are nonzero [KR08].\n1.6. Definition. Let M be a closed n-dimensional manifold. Let d \u2265 1\nbe an integer. Consider a partition\nn = k1 + . . . + kd ,\n\nk1 \u2264 k2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 kd\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere ki \u2265 1 for all i = 1, . . . , d. We say that the partition (or the dtuple (k1 , . . . , kd )) is categorical for M if the inequality\nsysk1 (G) sysk2 (G) . . . syskd (G) \u2264 C(M) voln (G)\n\n(1.3)\n\n\f4\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV, M. KATZ, AND YU. RUDYAK\n\nis satisfied by all metrics G on M, where the constant C(M) is expected\nto depend only on the topological type of M, but not on the metric G.\nThe size of a partition is defined to be the integer d.\n1.7. Definition. The systolic category of M, denoted catsys (M), is the\nlargest size of a categorical partition for M.\nIn particular, we have catsys M \u2264 dim M.\nWe know of no example of manifold whose systolic category exceeds\nits Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. The lower bound of b1 (M) + 1 for\nthe systolic category of a manifold M with non-vanishing fiber class in\nthe free abelian cover of M, discussed in Section 6, therefore inspires\nthe following question.\n1.8. Question. Is the non-vanishing of the fiber class in the free abelian\ncover of M, a sufficient condition to guarantee a lower bound of b1 (M)+\n1 for the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of M?\nThe answer is affirmative if the fiber class can be represented as a\nMassey product, see Section 6.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we review\nthe notion of systolic category. In Section 4, we obtain an upper bound\nfor the systolic category of a closed n-manifold in terms of its fundamental group and, in particular, prove that the systolic category of\na 4-manifold with free fundamental group does not exceed 2 (Corollary 5.2).\nIn Section 6 we investigate the next possible value of the categories,\nnamely 3. We recall a 1983 result of M. Gromov's related to Abel\u2013\nJacobi maps, and apply it to obtain a lower bound of 3 for the systolic category for a class of manifolds defined by a condition of nontrivial self-linking of a typical fiber of the Abel\u2013Jacobi map. In fact,\nnon-triviality of the self-linking class guarantees the homological nontriviality of the typical fiber lifted to the free abelian cover.\nMarcel Berger's monograph [Be03, pp. 325-353] contains a detailed\nexposition of the state of systolic affairs up to '03. More recent developments are covered in [Ka07].\nRecent publications in systolic geometry include the articles [AK10,\nBe08, Bru08a, Bru08b, Bru08c, BKSW09, DKR08, 1, EL08, HKU08,\nKK08, KK09, KW09, Ka08, KS10, RS08, Sa08].\n2. A systolic introduction\nLet T2 be a 2-dimensional torus equipped with a Riemannian metric G. Let A be the area of (T2 , G). Let l be the least length of a\n\n\fCOHOMOLOGICAL DIMENSION, SELF-LINKING, AND SYSTOLES\n\n5\n\nnoncontractible loop in (T2 , G). What can one say about the scaleinvariant ratio l2 /A? It is easy to see that the ratio can be made\narbitrarily small for a suitable choice of metric G. On the other hand,\nit turns out that the ratio\n\u221a is bounded from above.2 Indeed, C. Loewner\n2\nproved that l /A \u2264 2/ 3, for all metrics G on T , see [Pu52].\nMore generally, given a closed n-dimensional smooth manifold M\nwith non-trivial fundamental group, M. Berger and M. Gromov asked\nwhether there exists a constant C > 0 such that the inequality\nln \u2264 C vol(M) = C voln (M, G)\n\n(2.1)\n\nholds for all Riemannian metrics G on M; here l is the least length of a\nnoncontractible loop in M, while C is required to be independent of the\nmetric G. Indeed, Gromov [Gr83] proved that such a C = Cn exists\nif M is an essential manifold, meaning that M represents a nonzero\nhomology class in Hn (\u03c01 (M)). I. Babenko [Ba93] proved a converse.\nWe generalize these invariants as follows. Let hk denote the minimum of k-volumes of homologically nontrivial k-dimensional cycles (see\nSection 2 for details). Do there exist a partition k1 + * * * + kd = n of n,\nand a constant C such that the inequality\nd\nY\ni=1\n\nhki \u2264 C vol(M, G)\n\n(2.2)\n\nholds for all Riemannian metrics G on M? The invariants hk are the ksystoles, and the maximum value of d as in (2.2) is called the systolic\ncategory catsys of M [KR06, Ka07]. The goal of this work is to continue\nthe investigation of the invariant catsys started in [KR06, KR08].\nIt was originally pointed out by Gromov (see [Be93]) that this definition has a certain shortcoming. Namely, for S 1 \u00d7 S 3 one observes a\n\"systolic freedom\" phenomenon, in that the inequality\nsysh1 sysh3 \u2264 C vol(S 1 \u00d7 S 3 )\n\n(2.3)\n\nstsys1 stsys3 \u2264 vol4 (S 1 \u00d7 S 3 )\n\n(2.4)\n\nis violated for any C \u2208 R, by a suitable metric G on S 1 \u00d7 S 3 [Gr96,\nGr99]. This phenomenon can be overcome by a process of stabilisation.\nIt turns out that the difference between the stable systoles, stsysk ,\nand the ordinary ones, syshk has significant ramifications in terms of\nthe existence of geometric inequalities. Namely, in contrast with the\nviolation of (2.3), the inequality\n\nholds for all metrics on S 1 \u00d7 S 3 [Gr83] (see Theorem 3.2 for a generalisation).\n\n\f6\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV, M. KATZ, AND YU. RUDYAK\n\n3. Gromov's inequalities\nSystolic category can be thought of as a way of codifying three distinct types of systolic inequalities, all due to Gromov. There are three\nmain sources of systolic lower bounds for the total volume of a closed\nmanifold M. All three originate in Gromov's 1983 Filling paper [Gr83],\nand can be summarized as follows.\n(1) Gromov's inequality for the homotopy 1-systole of an essential\nmanifold M, see [We05, Gu09] and [Ka07, p. 97].\n(2) Gromov's stable systolic inequality (treated in more detail in\n[BK03, BK04]) corresponding to a cup product decomposition\nof the rational fundamental cohomology class of M, see Theorem 3.2.\n(3) A construction using the Abel\u2013Jacobi map to the Jacobi torus\nof M (sometimes called the dual torus), also based on a theorem\nof Gromov (elaborated in [IK04, BCIK07]).\nLet us describe the last construction in more detail. Let M be a\nconnected n-manifold. Let b = b1 (M). Let\nTb := H1 (M; R)/H1 (M; Z)R\nbe its Jacobi torus. A natural metric on the Jacobi torus of a Riemannian manifold is defined by the stable norm, see [Ka07, p. 94].\nThe Abel\u2013Jacobi map AM : M \u2192 Tb is discussed in [Li69, BK04],\ncf. [Ka07, p. 139]. A typical fiber FM \u2282 M (i.e. inverse image of a\ngeneric point) of AM is a smooth imbedded (n\u2212b)-submanifold (varying\nin type as a function of the point of Tb ). Our starting point is the\nfollowing observation of Gromov's [Gr83, Theorem 7.5.B], elaborated\nin [IK04].\n3.1. Theorem (M. Gromov). If the homology class [FM ] \u2208 Hn\u2212b (M)\nof the lift of FM to the maximal free abelian cover M of M is nonzero,\nthen the total volume of M admits a lower bound in terms of the product\nof the volume of the Jacobi torus and the infimum of areas of cycles\nrepresenting the class [FM ].\nWe also reproduce the following result, due to Gromov [Gr83], see\nalso [BK03, Ka07], stated in terms of systolic category.\n3.2. Theorem (M. Gromov). For a closed orientable manifold M, the\nsystolic category of M is bounded from below by the rational cup-length\nof M.\nNote that Theorem 3.2 is not directly related to Theorem 3.1. For\ninstance, Theorem 3.2 implies that the systolic category of S 2 \u00d7 S 2 ,\n\n\fCOHOMOLOGICAL DIMENSION, SELF-LINKING, AND SYSTOLES\n\n7\n\nor CP2 , equals 2, while Theorem 3.1 gives no information about simplyconnected manifolds.\n4. Fundamental group and systolic category\nThroughout this section we will assume that \u03c0 is a finitely presented\ngroup. Denote by cd(\u03c0) the cohomological dimension of \u03c0, see [Bro94].\n4.1. Lemma. If \u03c01 (M) is of finite cohomological dimension then M\nadmits a map f : M \u2192 B to a simplicial complex B of dimension at\nmost cd(\u03c01 M), inducing an isomorphism of fundamental groups.\nProof. Let \u03c0 = \u03c01 (M). When d = cd(\u03c0) 6= 2, by the Eilenberg\u2013Ganea\ntheorem [EG57], there exists a d-dimensional model B\u03c0 for the classifying space of \u03c0, which may be assumed to be a simplicial complex. This\nyields the desired map f : M \u2192 B\u03c0 by universality of the classifying\nspace.\nIn the case d = 2 it is still unknown whether one can assume that\ndim B\u03c0 = 2 for all \u03c0. That this is so is the content of the Eilenberg\u2013\nGanea conjecture. In this case we can assume only that dim B\u03c0 \u2264 3.\nWe claim that there is a map q : B\u03c0 \u2192 B\u03c0 (2) onto the 2-skeleton\nthat induces an isomorphism of the fundamental groups. Indeed, the\nobstruction to retracting B\u03c0 onto B\u03c0 (2) is an element of the cohomology group\n\u0001\u0001\nH 3 B\u03c0; \u03c02 B\u03c0 (2)\nwith coefficients in the \u03c0-module \u03c02 (B\u03c0 (2) ). This group is zero, since by\nhypothesis cd(\u03c0) = 2. By the classical obstruction theory the identity\nmap of B\u03c0 (2) can be changed on the 2-dimensional skeleton without\nchanges on the 1-dimensional skeleton in such a way that a new map\nhas an extension q to B\u03c0. Since q : B\u03c0 \u2192 B\u03c0 (2) is the identity on the\n1-skeleton, it induces an isomorphism of the fundamental groups.\nNow in the case d = 2 we use the complex B\u03c0 (2) instead of B\u03c0\ntogether with the map q \u25e6 f : M \u2192 B\u03c0 (2) instead of f .\n\u0003\n\n4.2. Theorem. Let M be a closed n-manifold, with cd(\u03c01 (M)) = d \u2264\nn. Then the systolic category of M is at most (n + d)/2.\n\nProof. Let gM be a fixed background metric on M. Choose a map\nf :M \u2192B\n\nas in Lemma 4.1, as well as a fixed PL metric gB on B. Consider the\nmetric f \u2217 (gB ) on M pulled back by f (see [Ba93, Ka07]). This metric\nis defined by a quadratic form of rank at most d at every point of M.\nNote that the quadratic form can be thought of as the square of the\nlength element.\n\n\f8\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV, M. KATZ, AND YU. RUDYAK\n\nNext, we scale the pull-back metric by a large real parameter t \u2208 R.\nWhen the length of a vector is multiplied by t, the convention is to\nwrite the metric as t2 f \u2217 (gB ). Since the rank of the metric is at most d,\nthe volume of gM + t2 f \u2217 (gB ) grows at most as td , where gM is any fixed\nbackground metric on M. We obtain a family of metrics\ngt = gM + t2 f \u2217 (gB )\n\n(4.1)\n\nd\n\non M with volume growing at most as t where d = dim B, while\nthe 1-systole grows as t. Thus the ratio\nsysd+1\n1 (M, gt )\nvol(M, gt )\ntends to infinity. The addition of a fixed background metric on M\nin (4.1) ensures a uniform lower bound for all its k-systoles for k \u2265 2.\nIt follows that a partition\nn = |1 + *{z\n* * + 1} + kd+2 + * * * + kr\nd+1\n\ncannot be categorical.\n\n\u0003\n\n5. Systolic category, LS category, and cd(\u03c0)\n5.1. Remark. The upper bound of Theorem 4.2 is sharp when \u03c0 is a\nfree group (d = 1) in the sense that \u03c0 is the fundamental group of a\nclosed (2k + 1)-manifold\n!\nk\u22121\nY\nM=\nS 2 \u00d7 (#(S 1 \u00d7 S 2 ))\ni=1\n\nwith catsys M = k + 1 = (2k + 2)/2 in view of Theorem 3.2. Similarly,\nfor the (2k + 2)-dimensional manifold\nM = S3 \u00d7\n\nk\u22122\nY\ni=1\n\nS 2 \u00d7 (#(S 1 \u00d7 S 2 )),\n\nwhere k > 1, we have catsys M = k + 1. The case of a 4-dimensional\nmanifold follows from Corollary 5.2.\n5.2. Corollary. The systolic category of a closed orientable 4-manifold\nwith free fundamental group is at most 2, and it is exactly 2 if M is\nnot a homotopy sphere.\nProof. The partitions 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 and 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 are ruled\nout by Theorem 4.2. The only remaining possibilities are the partitions 4 = 1 + 3 (corresponding to category value 2) and 4 = 4 (that\nwould correspond to category value 1). If M is not simply-connected,\n\n\fCOHOMOLOGICAL DIMENSION, SELF-LINKING, AND SYSTOLES\n\n9\n\nthen by the hypothesis of the corollary, b1 (M) \u2265 1 and therefore M\nsatisfies a systolic inequality of type (2.4) (see Theorem 3.2), proving that catsys (M) = 2. If M is simply-connected but not a homotopy\nsphere, then H2 (M) = \u03c02 (M) is free abelian and b2 (M) > 0, so that M\nsatisfies the systolic inequality\nstsys2 (M)2 \u2264 b2 (M) vol(M),\nsee [BK03] (a special case of Theorem 3.2), proving catsys (M) = 2. \u0003\n5.3. Corollary. For every closed orientable 4-manifold we have the\ninequality catsys M \u2264 catLS M, and the strict inequality is possible in\nthe case catsys M = 2 < 3 = catLS M only.\nWe do not know, however, if the case of the strict inequality can be\nrealized.\nProof. If the fundamental group of M is free then catLS M \u2264 2 [MK95],\nand in this case the result follows from Corollary 5.2. If catsys M =\n4 then catLS M = 4, [KR06, Ka07], and hence catsys M \u2264 catLS M\nif catLS M \u2265 3. Finally, if the fundamental group of M is not free\nthen catLS M \u2265 3 [DKR08].\n\u0003\n5.4. Remark. The equality catsys M n = catLS M n for n \u2264 3 was proved\nin [KR06, KR08].\n6. Self-linking of fibers and a lower bound for catsys\nIn this section we will continue with the notation of Theorem 3.1.\n6.1. Proposition. Let M be a closed connected manifold (orientable\nor non-orientable). If a typical fiber of the Abel\u2013Jacobi map represents\na nontrivial (n \u2212 b)-dimensional homology class in M, then systolic\ncategory satisfies catsys (M) \u2265 b + 1.\nProof. If the fiber class is nonzero, then the Abel\u2013Jacobi map is necessarily surjective in the set-theoretic sense. One then applies the technique of Gromov's proof of Theorem 3.1, cf. [IK04], combined with a\nlower bound for the volume of the Jacobi torus in terms of the b-th\npower of the stable 1-systole, to obtain a systolic lower bound for the\ntotal volume corresponding to the partition\nn = 1 + 1 + * * * + 1 + (n \u2212 b),\nwhere the summand \"1\" occurs b times. Note that Poincar\u00e9 duality is\nnot used in the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV, M. KATZ, AND YU. RUDYAK\n\nThe goal of the remainder of this section is to describe a sufficient\ncondition for applying Gromov's theorem, so as to obtain such a lower\nbound in the case when the fiber class in M vanishes.\nFrom now on we assume that M is orientable, has dimension n,\nand b1 (M) = 2. Let {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 H 1 (M) be an integral basis for H 1 (M).\nLet FM be a typical fiber of the Abel\u2013Jacobi map. It is easy to see\nthat [FM ] is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the cup product \u03b1 ` \u03b2. Thus, if \u03b1 ` \u03b2 6=\n0 then catsys M \u2265 3 by Proposition 6.1. If \u03b1 ` \u03b2 = 0 then the Massey\nproduct h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i is defined and has zero indeterminacy.\n6.2. Theorem. Let M be a closed connected orientable manifold of\ndimension n with b1 (M) = 2. If h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i ` \u03b2 6= 0 then catsys M \u2265 3.\nNote that, on the Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann side, we similarly have a\nlower bound catLS M \u2265 3 if h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i =\n6 0, since the element h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i\nhas category weight 2 [Ru97, Ru99].\nTo prove the theorem, we reformulate it in the dual homology language.\n6.3. Definition. Let F = FM \u2282 M be an oriented typical fiber. Assume [F ] = 0 \u2208 Hn\u22122 (M). Choose an (n \u2212 1)-chain X with \u2202X =\nF . Consider another regular fiber F \u2032 \u2282 M. The oriented intersection X \u2229 F \u2032 defines a class\nlM (FM , FM ) \u2208 Hn\u22123 (M),\n\nwhich will be referred to as the self-linking class of a typical fiber of AM .\nThe following lemma asserts, in particular, that the self-linking class\nis well-defined, at least up to sign.\n6.4. Lemma. The class lM (FM , FM ) is dual, up to sign, to the cohomology class h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i ` \u03b2 \u2208 H 3 (M).\nProof. The classes \u03b1, \u03b2 are Poincar\u00e9 dual to hypersurfaces A, B \u2282 M\nobtained as the inverse images under AM of a pair {u, v} of loops defining a generating set for H1 (T2 ). The hypersurfaces can be constructed\nas inverse images of a regular point under a projection M \u2192 S 1 to\none of the summand circles. Clearly, the intersection A \u2229 B \u2282 M is a\ntypical fiber\nFM = A \u2229 B\nof the Abel\u2013Jacobi map (namely, inverse image of the point u\u2229v \u2208 T2 ).\nThen another regular fiber F \u2032 can be represented as A\u2032 \u2229 B \u2032 where, say,\nthe set A\u2032 is the inverse image of a loop u\u2032 \"parallel\" to u. Then A\u2032 \u2229 X\nis a cycle, since\n\u2202(A\u2032 \u2229 X) = A\u2032 \u2229 A \u2229 B = \u2205.\n\n\fCOHOMOLOGICAL DIMENSION, SELF-LINKING, AND SYSTOLES\n\n11\n\nMoreover, it is easy to see that the homology class [A\u2032 \u2229 X] is dual to\nthe Massey product h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i, by taking a representative a of \u03b1 such\nthat a ` a = 0. Now, since F \u2032 = A\u2032 \u2229 B \u2032 , we conclude that [F \u2032 \u2229 X] is\ndual, up to sign, to h\u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2i ` \u03b2.\n\u0003\n6.5. Remark. In the case of 3-manifolds with first Betti number 2,\nthe non-vanishing of the self-linking number is equivalent to the nonvanishing of C. Lescop's generalization \u03bb of the Casson-Walker invariant, cf. [Le96]. See T. Cochran and J. Masters [CM05] for generalizations.\nNow Theorem 6.2 will follow from Theorem 6.6 below.\n6.6. Theorem. Assume b1 (M n ) = 2. The non-triviality of the selflinking class in Hn\u22123 (M) implies the bound catsys (M) \u2265 3.\nThe theorem is immediate from the proposition below. If the fiber\nclass in M of the Abel\u2013Jacobi map vanishes, one can define the selflinking class of a typical fiber, and proceed as follows.\n6.7. Proposition. The non-vanishing of the self-linking of a typical\n2\nfiber A\u22121\nM (p) of AM : M \u2192 T is a sufficient condition for the nonvanishing of the fiber class [FM ] in the maximal free abelian cover M\nof M.\nProof. The argument is modeled on the one found in [KL05] in the\ncase of 3-manifolds, and due to A. Marin (see also [Ka07, p. 165-166]).\nConsider the pullback diagram\nA\n\nM\nM \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\npy\n\nA\n\nR2\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nM\n\u2192 T2\nM \u2212\u2212\u2212\nwhere AM is the Abel\u2013Jacobi map and the right-hand map is the universal cover of the torus. Choose points x, y \u2208 R2 with distinct images\n\u22121\n\u22121\nin T2 . Let F x = AM (x) and F y = AM (y) be lifts of the corresponding\nfibers Fx , Fy \u2282 M. Choose a properly imbedded ray ry \u2282 R2 joining the\npoint y \u2208 R2 to infinity while avoiding x (as well as its Z2 -translates),\nand consider the complete hypersurface\n\n\u22121\n\nS = A (ry ) \u2282 M\n\nwith \u2202S = F y . We have S \u2229 Tg F x = \u2205 for all g \u2208 G, where G \u223c\n= Z2\ndenotes the group of deck transformations of the covering p : M \u2192 M\nand Tg is the deck transformation given by g.\n\n\f12\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV, M. KATZ, AND YU. RUDYAK\n\nWe will prove the contrapositive. Namely, the vanishing of the class\nof the lift of the fiber implies the vanishing of the self-linking class.\nIf the surface F x is zero-homologous in M, we can choose a compact\nhypersurface W \u2282 M with\n\u2202W = F x\n\n(if there is no such hypersurface for F x , we work with a sufficiently high\nmultiple NFx , see [KL05] for details). The (n \u2212 3)-dimensional homology class lM (Fx , Fy ) in M can therefore be represented by the (n \u2212 3)dimensional cycle given by the oriented intersection p(W ) \u2229 Fy . Now\nwe have\nX\nX\n\u2202 (Tg W \u2229 S) .\np(W ) \u2229 Fy =\nTg W \u2229 F y =\n(6.1)\ng\u2208G\n\ng\u2208G\n\nBut the last sum is a finite sum of boundaries, and hence represents\nthe zero homology class. The finiteness of the sum follows from the\nfact that the first sum contains only finitely many non-zero summands,\ndue to the compactness of W .\n\u0003\n\nTo summarize, if the lift of a typical fiber to the maximal free abelian\ncovering of M n with b1 (M) = 2 defines a nonzero class, then one obtains\nthe lower bound catsys (M) \u2265 3, due to the existence of a suitable\nsystolic inequality corresponding to the partition\nn = 1 + 1 + (n \u2212 2)\n\nas in (1.3), by applying Gromov's Theorem 3.1.\nReferences\n[AK10]\n\nAmbrosio, L.; Katz, M.: Flat currents modulo p in metric spaces and\nfilling radius inequalities, Comm.
