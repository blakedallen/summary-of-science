INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the last years many experimental results have pointed out the presence of strong\nelectron-phonon (el \u2212 ph) coupling and polaronic effects in several compounds, such as hightemperature cuprate superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance manganites.1,2 This\nlarge amount of experimental data has renewed the interest in studying simplified el \u2212 ph\ncoupled systems of the Holstein3 or Fr\u00f6hlich4 type and in proposing more realistic interaction\nmodels.5,6\nThe Holstein molecular crystal model is the prototype for short-range (SR) el \u2212 ph\ninteraction since it takes into account local coupling of a tight-binding electron to optical\nlocal phonon modes. Till now an exact solution for this model has not been found and\nperturbative expansions are not able to describe the most interesting region characterized\nby intermediate el \u2212 ph couplings and electron and phonon energy scales not well separated.\nIn this regime, as shown by several numerical studies7\u201311 and variational approaches,12\u201314\n\nthe system undergoes a crossover from a weakly dressed electron to a massive localized\npolaronic quasiparticle, the small Holstein polaron (SHP ), with increasing the strength\nof interaction. All the ground state properties of the Holstein moldel can be described\nwith great accuracy by a variational approach13,14 based on a linear superposition of Bloch\nstates that describe weak and strong coupling polaron wave functions. Indeed this method\nprovides an immediate physical interpretation of the intermediate regime and is in excellent\nagreement with numerical results.\nRecently a quite general el \u2212 ph lattice Hamiltonian with a \"density-displacement\" type\ninteraction has been introduced in order to understand the role of long-range (LR) coupling\non the polaron formation.5,15 The model for a single particle is described by the Hamiltonian\nH\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\nc\u2020i cj\n\n+ \u03c90\n\nX\u0012\ni\n\na\u2020i ai\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n1\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j |)c\u2020i ci aj + a\u2020j .\n+ \u03b1\u03c90\nf (|R\n+\n2\ni,j\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nThe units are such that h\u0304 = 1. In Eq.(1) c\u2020i (ci ) denotes the electron creation (annihilation)\n2\n\n\f~ i , and the symbol <> denotes\noperator at site i, whose position vector is indicated by R\nnearest neighbours linked through the transfer integral t. The operator a\u2020i (ai ) represents\nthe creation (annihilation) operator for phonon on the site i, \u03c90 is the frequency of the\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j |) is\noptical local phonon modes, \u03b1 controls the strength of el \u2212 ph coupling, and f (|R\nthe interacting force between an electron on the site i and an ion displacement on the site j.\n~i \u2212R\n~ j |) = \u03b4 ~ ~ , while in genThe Hamiltonian (1) reduces to the Holstein model if f (|R\nRi ,Rj\neral it contains LR interaction. In particular when one attempts to mimic the nonscreened\ncoupling between doped holes and apical oxygen in some cuprates,5 the interaction force is\ngiven by\n\u0010\n\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j |) = |R\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j |2 + 1\nf (|R\n\n\u0011\u2212 3\n2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j | is measured in units of lattice constant. Considering the general\nif the distance |R\nel \u2212 ph matrix element M~q\n\u03b1\u03c90 X\n~ m |)ei~q*R~ m ,\nM~q = \u221a\nf (|R\nL m\n\n(3)\n\nwith L number of lattice sites, we can define the polaronic shift Ep\nEp =\n\nX\nq\n~\n\nM~q2\n,\n\u03c90\n\n(4)\n\nand the coupling constant \u03bb = Ep /zt, with z lattice coordination number, that represents a\nnatural measure of the strength of the el \u2212 ph interaction in both SR and LR case. Clearly\nfor LR interaction forces the matrix element M~q is peaked around ~q = 0. Since it has\nbeen claimed that the enhancement of the forward direction in the el \u2212 ph scattering could\nplay a role in explaining several anomalous properties of cuprates as the linear temperature\nbehaviour of the resistivity and the d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap,16,17 the\nstudy of lattice polaron features for LR interactions is important in order to clarify the role\nof the el \u2212 ph coupling in complex systems.\nWhen the interaction force is given by Eq. (2), the model has been investigated applying a\npath-integral Monte-Carlo (P IMC) algorithm5,15 efficient in the thermodynamic limit. The\n3\n\n\ffirst investigations have been mainly limited to the determination of the polaron effective\nmass pointing out that, due to the LR coupling, the polaron is much lighter than the\nSHP with the same binding energy in the strong coupling regime. Furthermore it has\nbeen found that this effect due to the weaker band renormalization becomes smaller in\nthe antiadiabatic regime. Then the quasi-particle properties have been studied by an exact\nLanczos diagonalization method18 on finite one-dimensional lattices (up to 10 sites) making a\nclose comparison with the corresponding properties of HP . As a result of the LR interaction,\nthe lattice deformation induced by the electron is spread over many lattice sites in the\nstrong coupling region giving rise to the formation of a large polaron (LP ) as in the weak\ncoupling regime. All numerical and analytical results have been mainly obtained in the\nantiadiabatic and non-adiabatic regime. Only recently the behavior of the effective mass\nof a two-site system19 in the adiabatic regime has been studied within the nearest-neighbor\napproximation for the el \u2212 ph interaction confirming that the LP is lighter than the SHP\nat strong coupling.\nIn this paper we pursue the study of the ground state of the model with the interaction\nforce given by Eq. (2) in the thermodynamic limit. We employ a variational approach\npreviously proposed for the study of systems with el \u2212 ph local coupling13,14 and based on\na linear superposition of Bloch states that describe weak and strong coupling polaron wave\nfunctions. Although the method is valid for any spatial dimension, we limit our study to the\none-dimensional case. It has been found that the variational approach provides an estimate\nof the ground state energy in good agreement with P IMC results. The evolution of the\nground-state spectral weight, the average kinetic energy, the mean number of phonons, and\nthe electron-lattice correlation function with respect to the adiabaticity ratio \u03c90 /t and the\nel \u2212 ph coupling constant is discussed focusing on the adiabatic regime. Indeed, in the\nadiabatic case, there is a range of values of the el \u2212 ph coupling where the ground state is\nwell described by a particle with a weakly renormalized mass but a spectral weight much\nsmaller than unity. Furthermore, with increasing the strength of interaction in the same\nregime, the renormalized mass gradually increases, while the average kinetic energy is not\n4\n\n\fstrongly reduced. Finally regions of the model parameters are distinguished according to\nthe values assumed by the spectral weight. The resulting \"phase diagram\"20 shows strong\nmixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom for small values of the el \u2212 ph coupling\nconstant in the adiabatic case.\n\nII. VARIATIONAL WAVE FUNCTION\n\nThe variational approach is summarized following the lines of previous works.13,14\nWe consider as trial wave functions translational invariant Bloch states obtained by\ntaking a superposition of localized states centered on different lattice sites:\n1 X i~k*R~ n (i) ~\n(i)\n|\u03c8~k >= \u221a\ne\n|\u03c8~k (Rn ) >,\nL R~ n\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n(i) ~\n|\u03c8~k (R\nn)\n\nP h\n\n>= e\n\nq\n~\n\n~\n(i)\nh~q (~k)a~q ei~q*Rn +h.c.\n\ni\n\nX\nm\n\n(i) ~\n\u2020\n\u03c6~k (R\nm )cm+n |0 > .\n\n(6)\n\nIn Eq. (5) the apex i = w, s indicates the weak and strong coupling polaron wave function,\n(i) ~\nrespectively, |0 > denotes the electron and phonon vacuum state, and \u03c6~k (R\nm ) are variational\n\nparameters defining the spatial broadening of the electronic wave function. The phonon\n(i)\ndistribution functions h~q (~k) are chosen in order to reproduce the description of polaron\n\nfeatures in the two asymptotic limits.13 Therefore the weak coupling phonon distribution\n(w)\nfunction h~q (~k) is assumed as\n(w)\nh~q (~k) =\n\nM~q\n,\n~\n\u03c90 + Eb (k + ~q) \u2212 Eb (~k)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Eb (~k) is the free electron band energy, while the strong coupling phonon distribution\n(s)\nfunction h~q (~k) as\n\nM~q X\n(s)\n~ m )|2 ei~q*R~ m .\nh~q (~k) =\n|\u03c6~k (R\n\u03c90 m\n\n(8)\n\nA careful inspection of weak and strong coupling wave functions shows that in the intermediate regime they are not orthogonal and the off-diagonal matrix elements of the\n5\n\n\fHamiltonian are not zero. Hence the ground state energy is determined by considering as\ntrial state a linear superposition of the weak and strong coupling wave functions:\n(w)\n\nA~k |\u03c8~k\n\n(s)\n\n> +B~k |\u03c8~k >\n\n|\u03c8~k >= q\n,\nA~2k + B~k2 + 2A~k B~k S~k\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n(w)\n\n(w)\n|\u03c8~k\n\n|\u03c8~k\n\n(s)\n\n>\n\n>= r\n(w) (w)\n< \u03c8~k |\u03c8~k >\n\n(s)\n, |\u03c8~k\n\n|\u03c8~k >\n\n>= r\n(s) (s)\n< \u03c8~k |\u03c8~k >\n\n(10)\n\nand S~k\n(w)\n\n(s)\n\n< \u03c8~k |\u03c8~k > +h.c.\nS~k =\n2\n(w)\n\nis the overlap factor of the two wave functions |\u03c8~k\n\n(11)\n(s)\n\n> and |\u03c8~k >. In Eq.(9) A~k and B~k\n\nare two additional variational parameters which provide the relative weight of the weak and\nstrong coupling solutions of the system for any particular value of ~k.\n(w)\n\n~ m ),\nWe perform the minimization procedure with respect to the parameters \u03c6~k (R\n(s)\n\n~ m ), A~ and B~ , assuming\n\u03c6~k (R\nk\nk\n(i) ~\n(i)\n(i)\n\u03c6~k (R\n~ n ,0 + \u03b2~k\nn ) = \u03b1~k \u03b4R\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nX\n\u03b4\n\n(i)\n\n\u03b4R~ n ,~\u03b4 + \u03b3~k\n\nX\n\u03b4\u2032\n\n(i)\n\n\u03b4R~ n ,\u03b4~\u2032 + \u03b7~k\n\nX\n\n\u03b4R~ n ,\u03b4~\u2032\u2032 ,\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b4\u2032\u2032\n\n(i)\n\nwhere the quantities \u03b1~k , \u03b2~k , \u03b3~k , and \u03b7~k denote variational parameters, and the symbols\n\u03b4, \u03b4 \u2032 , \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 indicate, respectively, the nearest, the next-nearest neighbors and so on. This choice\ntakes into account the broadening of the electron wave functions up to third neighbors and\nprovides an accurate description of the polaron features for any value of the parameters of the\nHamiltonian. The ground state energies obtained with this choice are slightly higher than\nP IMC mean energies, being the difference less than 0.5% in the worst case of intermediate\nregime. We note that these wave functions can be improved adding further terms in Eq.\n(12), so it is possible to obtain better and better estimates of the energy.\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nIn this paper we study the properties of the ground-state in the one-dimensional case.\n6\n\n\fIn Fig. 1(a) we report the polaron ground state energy for different values of the adiabaticity ratio as a function of the el \u2212 ph constant coupling \u03b1. We have checked that our\nvariational proposal recovers the asymptotic perturbative results and improves significantly\nthese asymptotic estimates in the intermediate region. Moreover, our data for the groundstate energy in the intermediate region are in very good agreement with the results of the\nP IMC approach5 shown as diamonds in Fig. 1(a). The consistency of the results with a\nnumerically more sophisticated approach indicates that the true wave function is very close\nto a superposition of weak and strong coupling states.\nAnother property of interest is the ground state spectral weight Z\nZ = Zk=0 = | < \u03c8k=0 |c\u2020k=0 |0 > |2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nthat gives the fraction of the bare electron state in the polaronic trial wave function. It\nmeasures how much the quasiparticle is different from the free electron (Z = 1), and a small\nvalue of Z indicates a strong mixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. As\nplotted in Fig. 1(b), the increase of the el \u2212 ph coupling strength induces a decrease of the\nspectral weight that is smooth also in the adiabatic regime. The reduction of Z is closely\nrelated to the decrease of the Drude weight obtained by exact diagonalizations18 pointing out\na gradual suppression of coherent motion. We note that the behavior of Z is different from\nthat of the local Holstein model. In fact for the latter Z results to be very close to the ratio\nm/m\u2217 , with m and m\u2217 bare electron and effective polaron mass, respectively,18 while for LR\ncouplings Z < m/m\u2217 in the intermediate to strong coupling adiabatic regime. This relation\nis confirmed by the results shown in Fig.1 (b), where the dash-dotted line and the squares\non a similar line indicate the spectral weight Z and the ratio m/m\u2217 obtained within the\nvariational approach, respectively, as a function of the coupling constant \u03b1 at \u03c90 /t = 0.25.15\nActually there is a large region of the parameters in the adiabatic regime where the ground\nstate is well described by a particle with a weakly renormalized mass but a spectral weight\nZ much smaller than unity. While the electron drags the phonon cloud coherently through\nthe lattice, with increasing the el \u2212 ph coupling in the adiabatic case, a band collapse occurs\n7\n\n\fin the SR case, while the particle undergoes a weaker band renormalization in the case of\nLR interactions. Therefore in the LR case the polaron results lighter than the SHP in the\nintermediate to strong coupling adiabatic regime.\nInsight about the electron state is obtained by calculating its kinetic energy K in units\nof the bare one. Since the average kinetic energy gives the total weight of the optical\nconductivity, K includes both coherent and incoherent transport processes.18 As reported\nin Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c), in the strong coupling adiabatic region before the electron is\nselftrapped (K \u226a 1), the average kinetic energy is weakly renormalized, the ratio m/m\u2217 is\nreduced and the spectral weight is nearly zero. Furthermore, in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), within\nthe adiabatic regime, the average kinetic energy and the mean number of phonons do not\nshow any sharp change by increasing the el \u2212 ph coupling.\nAnother quantity associated to the polaron formation is the correlation function S(Rl )\nS(Rl ) = Sk=0 (Rl ) =\n\nP\n\nn\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n< \u03c8k=0 |c\u2020n cn a\u2020n+l + an+l |\u03c8k=0 >\n< \u03c8k=0 |\u03c8k=0 >\n\nor equivalently the normalized correlation function \u03c7(Rl ) = S(Rl )/N, with N =\n\n(14)\nP\n\nl\n\nS(Rl ).\n\nIn Fig. 2(a) we report the correlation function S(Rl ) at \u03c90 /t = 1 for several values of\nthe el \u2212 ph interaction. The lattice deformation is spread over many lattice sites giving\nrise to the formation of LP also in the strong coupling regime where really the correlation\nfunction assumes the largest values. In the inset of Fig. 2(a) the normalized electron-lattice\ncorrelation function \u03c7 shows consistency with the corresponding quantity calculated in a\nprevious work.18 While in the weak coupling regime the amplitude \u03c7 is smaller than the\nquantum lattice fluctuations, increasing the strength of the interaction, it becomes stronger\nand the lattice deformation is able to generate an attractive potential that can trap the\ncharge carrier. Clearly, even if the correlations between electron and lattice are large, the\nresulting polaron is delocalized over the lattice due to the translational invariance. Finally\nthe variation of the lattice deformation as a function of \u03c90 /t shown in Fig. 2(b) can be\nunderstood as a retardation effect. In fact, for small \u03c90 /t, the less numerous phonons excited\nby the passage of the electron take a long time to relax, therefore the lattice deformation\n8\n\n\fincreases far away from the current position of the electron.\nIn Fig. 3 we propose a \"phase diagram\" based on the values assumed by the spectral\nweight in analogy with the Holstein polaron.14 Analyzing the behavior of Z it is possible\nto distinguish three different regimes: (1) quasi-free-electron regime (0.9 < Z < 1) where\nthe electron has a weakly renormalized mass and the motion is coherent; (2) crossover\nregime (0.1 < Z < 0.9) characterized by intermediate values of spectral weight and a mass\nnot strongly enhanced; (3) strong coupling regime (Z < 0.1) where the spectral weight is\nnegligible and the mass is large but not enormous. We note that for LR interactions in the\nadiabatic case there is strong mixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom for values\nof the coupling constant \u03bb (solid lines) smaller than those characteristic of local Holstein\ninteraction (dashed lines). Furthermore in this case, entering the strong coupling regime,\nthe charge carrier does not undergo any abrupt localization, on the contrary, as indicated\nalso by the behavior of the average kinetic energy K, it is quite mobile.\nIn order to study the effects of different el \u2212 ph interactions, we have evaluated the\naverage kinetic energy for both LR and SR cases. As reported in Fig. 4(a), in excellent\nagreement with a previous study,18 for LR interactions K decreases very gradually with\nincreasing \u03bb. Furthermore, if the regime of parameters where the spectral weight Z = 0.1\nis considered, as shown in Fig. 4(b), in the adiabatic case the average kinetic energy is\nlarger for LR interactions (solid line) with respect to local Holstein ones (dashed line). The\ncomparison emphasizes that due to LR interactions in the adiabatic regime K is slightly\nrenormalized even if the coherent motion is small.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have extended a previous variational approach in order to study the\npolaronic ground-state features of a one dimensional el \u2212 ph model with long-range interaction. The trial function is based on a linear superposition of Bloch states that describe weak\nand strong coupling polaron wave functions and it provides an estimate of the ground state\n9\n\n\fenergy in good agreement with numerical methods. The results relative to spectral weight,\nthe average kinetic energy, the mean number of phonons, and the electron-lattice correlation\nfunction have been discussed mainly in the adiabatic regime. It has been possible to identify\na range of intermediate values of the el \u2212 ph coupling constant in the adiabatic case where\nthe system is well described by a particle characterized with a weakly renormalized mass\nbut a small spectral weight. In the same regime, further increasing the el \u2212 ph coupling, the\nrenormalized mass shows a smooth increase, while the average kinetic energy is not strongly\nreduced. Finally we have proposed a \"phase diagram\" according to the values assumed by\nthe spectral weight. It is found that there is strong mixing between electronic and phononic\ndegrees of freedom for small values of the el \u2212 ph coupling constant in the adiabatic case.\nThe variational approach can be easily generalized to high dimensions,13 and it has been\nrecently applied to study the three dimensional continuum Fr\u00f6hlich model giving a very\ngood description of ground state features.21 In any case the results discussed in this paper\nare not limited to the one-dimensional case as confirmed by the behavior of some properties\non the square lattice.5,15\n\nFIGURE CAPTIONS\n\nFig.1 The ground state energy E0 in units of \u03c90 (a), the spectral weight Z (b), the average\nkinetic energy K (c) and the average phonon number N (d) as a function of the\ncoupling constant \u03b1 for different values of the adiabatic ratio: \u03c90 /t = 2 (solid line),\n\u03c90 /t = 1 (dashed line), \u03c90 /t = 0.5 (dotted line) and \u03c90 /t = 0.25 (dash-dotted line).\nThe diamonds in figure (a) indicate the P IMC data for the energy kindly provided\nby P.
