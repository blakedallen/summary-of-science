Thus, spin\ncurrents can sense the magnetization state of the magnetic system. Slonczewski [3] and\nBerger [4] first predicted that spin currents of appropriate strength can also directly influence\nthe magnetizations without applying an external magnetic field. Electrons flowing from FM2\nto FM1 are first polarized by FM2 and then repolarized at the interface NM/FM1, where the\ntransverse component of the spin current is absorbed and acts as a torque on the magnetic\nmoment M1 of FM1 [5]. By reversing the current direction, the spin current reflected from\nFM2 is repolarized at the NM/FM1 interface leading to a reversed torque. Therefore, FM1\ncan be switched from the parallel to the antiparallel configuration with respect to FM2 back\nand forth by repeatedly reversing the current polarity, as long as M2 remains fixed. This\npinning can be achieved by different FM layer thicknesses [6, 7, 8], by the exchange bias\neffect [9], or by making use of interlayer exchange coupling, as in our case.\nIn order to achieve large spin-torque effects a high spin polarization P of the current is\nneeded. Thus, the present work is motivated by two publications of Stiles and Penn [10]\nand Stiles and Zangwill [5], in which the authors predict high spin polarization for singlecrystalline Fe/Ag interfaces. Single-crystalline layered structures can also serve as model\nsystems for comparison with theory due to the well known structure, the small amount\nof defects, and the homogeneous magnetic properties when prepared by molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE). In particular, single-crystalline Fe(001) layers show well-defined 4-fold inplane magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which also helps to stabilize the magnetization along\ntwo easy axes ([100] and [010]).\nFirst, we deposit the magnetic multilayer. In order to achieve single-crystalline growth\nwe use a standard MBE system. The native oxygen layer of the GaAs(001) substrates\n(10 \u00d7 10 mm2 ) is desorbed by annealing for 60 min at 580\u25e6 C under UHV conditions.\nWe deposit 1 nm Fe and 150 nm Ag at 100\u25e6C to get a flat buffer system after annealing at 300\u25e6C for 1 h [11].\n\nThe Ag buffer also act as a bottom electrode for the\n\ntransport measurements. The following layers are then deposited at room temperature:\nFe(14)/Cr(0.9)/Fe(10)/Ag(6)/Fe(2) [thicknesses in nm]. We check the crystalline surface\nstructure after each deposited layer by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The spots\ncharacteristic of (001) surfaces slightly broaden with increasing total thickness, but still in2\n\n\fFIG. 1: MOKE hysteresis loop of the extended layered system measured with the external magnetic\nfield parallel to one of the easy [100]-axes of Fe. The interlayer exchange coupling stabilizes the\nfully antiferromagnetic state below \u00b135 mT. The top Fe(2) is decoupled from the rest of the system\nas indicated by the negligible coupling constants J1 and J2 (see inset) of the Fe(2) layer, extracted\nfrom additional BLS measurements [12].\n\ndicate high crystalline quality, even for the final 50 nm Au(001) capping layer. Thicknesses\nare controlled by quartz crystal monitors. The bottom and central FM layers [Fe(14) and\nFe(10)] are coupled by interlayer exchange coupling over the Cr interlayer. Therefore, the\ncentral Fe(10) layer is magnetically harder with respect to the top Fe(2) layer.\nThe longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is used to measure the magnetic\nproperties of the samples. In Fig. 1 we present the hysteresis loop with the magnetic field\nparallel to one of the easy [100]-axes of the Fe layers in the film plane. The saturation field of\nthe system is |BS | = 76 mT. For smaller magnetic fields the central Fe(10) layer remagnetizes\nvia a canted state to the fully antiferromagnetic configuration of the trilayer stack below the\nswitching field \u00b135 mT. After reversing the field direction we measure another jump in the\nsignal, which corresponds to the reversal of the topmost 2 nm thick Fe layer at \u00b10.3 mT. At\n\u00b13 mT the two coupled Fe layers reverse simultaneously due to their unequal thickness.\nBy fitting the MOKE measurements and additional Brillouin Light Scattering measurements (BLS) [13] we extract the magnetic properties of each layer as compiled in the inset of\nFig. 1. The saturation magnetization MS and the crystalline anisotropy K1 have bulk values\n[14, 15] and indicate the high quality of the layers. The thin Fe(2) layer has reduced MS\nand K1 , which can be understood by the reduced thickness or by reduced growth quality.\n\n3\n\n\fThe negligible coupling constants J1 and J2 show that this layer is decoupled. KS denotes\nthe interface anisotropy.\nIn order to measure the spin-transfer effects in the CPP-geometry we have developed a\ncombined process of optical and e-beam lithography. First, we define the leads and contact\npads of the bottom electrode by using AZ5206 photoresist and ion beam etching (IBE).\nWe then employ HSQ (hydrogen silsesquioxane) as negative e-beam sensitive resist [16]\nand a Leica EBPG 5HR e-beam writer to define small nanopillars. The resist structures\nare circular and transferred into the magnetic layers by IBE. The timed etching process is\nstopped inside the magnetic multilayer. Typical dimensions of the developed resist structures\nare 100 - 150 nm (measured with an atomic force microscope). Due to redeposition of etched\nmaterial during IBE [17], the nanopillars broaden to 150 - 200 nm. The pillars are planarized\nby spin-coating HSQ. Subsequent e-beam exposure turns HSQ into SiOx , which electrically\ninsulates the pillars [16]. In order to improve the insulation, especially at the side walls of\nthe bottom electrodes, a 50 nm Si3 N4 layer is deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor\ndeposition (PECVD). We open the top of the nanopillars by IBE and use an optical lift-off\nprocess of 300 nm Au for the preparation of the top electrode for the 4-point resistance\nmeasurements.\nThe DC voltage drop of a constant current I applied to the junction is measured, and\nby dividing by I we calculate the absolute resistance R. The differential resistance dU/dI\nis recorded with lock-in technique by mixing a constant current with a small modulated\nvoltage (\u2248 300 \u03bcV and \u2248 12 kHz). Typical junction resistances lie in the range between 1\nand 3 \u03a9. The temperature can be controlled with a He flow cryostat between 4 and 300 K.\nThe magnetoresistance loop of a junction without applying a DC bias current is shown\nin Fig. 2. The solid (dashed) line represents the data with magnetic field along the easy\n(hard) axis of Fe(001). The curves show a completely different behavior for the two field\ndirections, but are the same along the second pair of easy and hard axes. Thus, the structure\nis still single-crystalline and exhibits 4-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The saturation\nfield of the structured sample is 190 mT, which is more than twice the saturation field of the\nextended layers (see Fig. 1). Another difference becomes obvious in the minor loop (inset of\nFig. 2), where the absolute resistance is measured with a small DC current of 1 mA. Coming\nfrom large positive magnetic field, the resistance drops to a smaller value at small reversed\nfields between 1 and 3 mT and jumps back to the high resistance state at larger negative\n4\n\n\fFIG. 2: GMR hysteresis loop with magnetic field parallel to an easy (solid) and hard (dashed)\naxis. Inset: Minor GMR loop. Only in the first half of the loop (+B \u2192 \u2212B) the resistance drops\nto a smaller value corresponding to a canted magnetization state. These drops occur not in every\ncycle. In the second half the resistance stays at the maximum value.\n\nfields. On the way back, the resistance stays at the maximum value. The drop on the first\nhalf of the cycle does not occur on every measurement. Thus, the patterning has modified\nthe magnetic configuration and the structured Fe(2) nanomagnet is presumably coupled to\nthe rest of the system by dipolar stray fields at the edges or by domain wall coupling. This\nis a common feature in these devices also seen in Co nanopillars [6]. Due to this effect, we\ncannot separate the contributions of both subsystems to the GMR, and therefore cannot\ngauge the resistance jumps measured under the influence of a large DC current in Fig. 3. The\ndramatic increase in the saturation field can also be explained by the competition between\nthe interlayer exchange coupling, external, and dipolar fields.\nThe overall GMR ratio defined as (RAP \u2212 RP )/RP , where RAP is the highest resistance\nvalue in the antiferromagnetic configuration and RP denotes the smallest resistance in the\nsaturated state, amounts to 2.6% at RT and 5.6% at 4 K.\nA DC current influences the resistance R and, at some critical values, the magnetization\nstate of the junction (Fig. 3). Positive current corresponds to an electron flow from the\n\"free\" Fe(2) to the \"fixed\" Fe(10) layer. We observe a parabolic background which has been\nmeasured previously [6, 7, 8, 9] and is usually explained by Joule heating of the junction. On\ntop of that, we measure field dependent resistance changes, which can be attributed to spintorque effects. For instance at -20 mT [Fig. 3(b)], the resistance drops at IC+ = +18.2 mA\nfrom the high-resistive to an intermediate state. After reducing the current again, the\n5\n\n\fFIG. 3: (a) DC current loops with magnetic field parallel to an easy axis. Curves measured at\ndifferent external fields as indicated are offset vertically for clarity. (b) Expanded view of the curve\nfor -20 mT with the interpretation of the switching processes occurring at positive and negative\nDC bias current.\n\nresistance jumps back to the large value. But also at negative bias the resistance changes at\nIC\u2212 = \u221212.1 mA from large to small. With an estimated junction diameter of d = 150 nm the\ncorresponding critical current densities are jc+ = 1 * 108 A/cm2 and jc\u2212 = \u22120, 7 * 108 A/cm2 .\nAs already mentioned in the discussion about the GMR data of Fig. 2 we cannot directly\nrelate the resistance jumps to changes between specific magnetization states.\nIf we start the measurement in the intermediate resistance state at a field of -31 mT, the\ncanted alignment is the initial state. But at large positive and negative currents (+31.4 and\n-24.8 mA) we observe strong deviations from the parabolic background that may indicate\ncurrent-driven high-frequency excitations of the magnetization.\nThe occurrence of jumps at both polarities of the current at small fields is at first glance\nsurprising, but can be explained by taking into account that both Fe/Cr and Fe/Ag interfaces\ncontribute and have spin scattering asymmetries with opposite signs [10, 18]. This leads for\nthe Fe/Cr subsystem to inverse current-induced magnetization switching, very similar to\ninverse GMR [19, 20]. Thus, the spin torques for the two subsystems are inverted. For\n\n6\n\n\finstance, a negative current stabilizes the parallel state for Fe/Ag/Fe and the antiparallel\nstate for Fe/Cr/Fe. At low fields, the central Fe(10) layer points opposite to the external\nmagnetic field (Fig. 1). At positive currents, the spin-transfer torque generated in the Fe/Cr\nsubsystem destabilizes this direction and switches the Fe(10) layer [Fig. 3(b)]. At negative\ncurrents, the Fe(2) layer gets unstable by the torque created from the Fe/Ag subsystem,\nwhile the Fe/Cr subsystem is even stronger stabilized in the antiparallel state.\nAt large magnetic fields exceeding the saturation field [e.g., -1166 mT in Fig. 3(a)], the\ntwo thick bottom layers [Fe(14) and Fe(10)] are stronger stabilized by the Zeeman energy\nthan the Fe(2) layer, and therefore only one step-like resistance change due to magnetic\nexcitations of Fe(2) at I > 0 is observed under these conditions.\nIn conclusion, we have prepared single-crystalline nanopillars by molecular beam epitaxy\nand a combined process of optical and e-beam lithography. The extended multilayers are\ncharacterized by MOKE and compared to CPP-GMR data of the nanopillars, which clearly\nshow the 4-fold magnetocrystalline anisotropy of Fe. The large GMR ratio of up to 5.6%\nat 4 K reflects the high spin polarization predicted in Refs. [5, 10]. After the patterning\nprocess the magnetic properties change so that the \"free\" Fe(2) layer is now coupled to\nthe rest of the system by dipolar stray fields. Under the influence of a DC current we are\nable to measure distinct resistance changes, which give clear evidence of spin-torque effects\nat current densities of about 108 A/cm2 . This value is mostly determined by the sizable\ndipolar coupling in the nanopillar. At high magnetic fields, step-like resistance changes are\nmeasured at positive currents and are attributed to current-driven magnetic excitations.\nThe opposite spin scattering asymmetries of Fe/Cr and Fe/Ag enable us to observe CIMS\nat small magnetic fields for both subsystems in a single device. The switching at opposite\ncurrent polarity provides opportunities for optimizing the CIMS behavior and realizing further magnetic excitation dynamics, e.g. by exciting one subsystem at higher current density\nwhile simultaneously suppressing excitations of the fixed layer with the torque exerted by\nthe second subsystem.\n\n[1] M.
