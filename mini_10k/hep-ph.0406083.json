In the specific context of heterotic orbifold compactification scenarios, it is\neven possible to get some clues on the SUSY breaking mechanism of the more fundamental underlying theory. In this paper, we investigate the prospects for indirect detection of\nneutralino dark matter via gamma-ray (continuum and line) and synchrotron radiation from\nthe Galactic center, in the context of AMSB scenarios in an effective heterotic framework,\nwhich constitutes a consistent SUSY model between high energy theory and low energy\nphenomenology.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMany independent measurements provide convincing evidence that most of the matter in the\nUniverse is dark, i.e. non\u2013baryonic and of unknown nature, the most common dark matter (DM)\ncandidate being a Weakly\u2013Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) [1]. Supersymmetric (SUSY)\nextensions of the Standard Model (SM) naturally predict a massive weakly interacting particle\n(WIMP) called neutralino (\u03c701 \u2261 \u03c7), which, in most versions of SUSY models, is the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (LSP), and is made stable by virtue of the conservation of R\u2013parity.\nDark matter searches are often discussed in the very popular mSUGRA, a.k.a CMSSM (constrained MSSM), model [2] where one assumes unification of the soft SUSY breaking parameters\nat the GUT scale. This assumption is essentially a reduction of the parameter space and has no\nreal theoretical motivation. More refined SUSY models have been studied in the context of DM\nsearches, relaxing the hypothesis of universality [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nHere we focus on effective string inspired models, which represent a possible consistent framework linking fundamental high energy theory with low energy physics. Recently, the full one loop\nsoft supersymmetry breaking terms, in a large class of superstring effective theories, have been\ncalculated [17], based on orbifold compactifications of the weakly\u2013coupled heterotic string (including the so\u2013called anomaly mediated contributions). The parameter space in this class of models\nhas already been severely constrained taking into account accelerator and relic density constraints\n[18], direct or indirect detection of DM from the Sun [19], or benchmark models at the Tevatron\n[20]. In this model, supersymmetry breaking is transmitted by the auxiliary ('F ') fields of the\ncompactification moduli T \u03b1 , whose expectation values determine the size of the compact manifold,\nor by the dilaton auxiliary field S, whose vacuum expectation value determines the magnitude of\nthe coupling constant gSTR . The spectrum and couplings of SUSY particles depend crucially on\nthe contributions of each hidden fields to the breaking mechanism.\n\n\f2\nThere exist many ways of probing the existence of neutralino dark matter and supersymmetry.\nOf course, accelerator searches are among the most promising ones. Recent results give a mass limit\nof 45 GeV for the lightest neutralino, in the framework of mSUGRA [25]. Furthermore, interesting\nconstraints have been derived from many experiments on direct and indirect detection of dark\nmatter, whose sensitivities are expected to increase by orders of magnitude in the near future (see\nRef. [1] and references therein). Direct detection is made via the measurement of the recoil energy\nof the nuclei of the detector after an elastic scattering with a WIMP. Indirect detection experiments\nlook for the products of annihilation of the LSP in the Sun, Galactic halo or external galaxies (see\nRef. [1] and references therein).\nIt has been emphasized in [19] that one\u2013ton detectors are needed for direct searches to test all\nthe parameter space in scenarios dominated by the dilaton F \u2212breaking terms, and that moduli\ndominated scenarios are generically not detectable by dark matter searches (direct or indirect\ndetection with neutrinos coming from the Sun) if we combine favored relic density and accelerator\nconstraints. This means that such DM searches could be a way to distinguish the origin(s) of the\nSUSY breaking mechanism, and to restrict or even determine some fundamental parameters of the\nmodel (of stringy nature or not).\nThe purpose of the present paper is to investigate DM indirect detection with high energy\ngamma rays and synchrotron radiation from neutralino annihilation at the Galactic center, in the\nclass of weakly coupled heterotic string models discussed above [17, 18, 19, 20].\nThe paper is organized as follows: after a brief survey on the motivations, phenomenology and\nconstruction of the effective string models studied here, we analyze in section 2 and 3 the influence\nof the different coefficients parameterizing the SUSY breaking, on the gamma-ray and synchrotron\nemission from the Galactic center. In section 4, we analyze the prospects of observation of gammaray fluxes with present and foreseen experiments and discuss synchrotron radiation in section 5.\nWe present our conclusions in section 6.\nII.\nA.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nStructure of heterotic orbifolds models at one loop\n\nThe task of string phenomenology is to make contact between the high energy string theory, and\nthe low energy world. For this purpose, we need to build a superstring theory in four dimensions,\nable to reproduce the Standard Model gauge group, three generations of squarks, and a coherent\nmechanism of SUSY breaking. We set our analysis in the framework of orbifold compactifications\nof the heterotic string, within the context of supergravity effective theory, we focus on models where\nthe action is dominated by 1\u2013loop contributions to soft breaking terms. The key property of the\nmodels is the non\u2013universality of soft terms, consequences of the beta\u2013function appearing in the\nsuperconformal anomalies. This non\u2013universality gives a peculiar phenomenology in the gaugino\nand the scalar sector, modifying considerably the predictions of mSUGRA models. In fact, these\nstring\u2013motivated models show a new behavior, that interpolates between the phenomenology of\nunified supergravity models (mSUGRA) and models dominated by the superconformal anomalies\n(AMSB). The constraints arising from accelerator searches, and some dark matter aspects (direct\nand neutrino indirect detections) have been already studied in [18, 19]. We extend here the analysis\nto gamma-ray and synchrotron emission from the Galactic center.\nWe provide a phenomenological study within the context of orbifold compactifications of the\nweakly\u2013coupled heterotic string, where we distinguish two regimes:\n\u2022 In the first one, the SUSY breaking is transmitted by the compactification moduli T \u03b1 , whose\nvacuum expectation values determine the size of the compact manifold. Generic (0,2) orbifold\n\n\f3\nmodels contain three T\u03b1 moduli fields. We considered a situation in which only an \"overall\nmodulus T \" field contributes to the SUSY\u2013breaking. The use of an overall modulus T is\nequivalent to the assumption that the three T\u03b1 fields of generic orbifold models give similar\ncontributions to SUSY\u2013breaking. This is expected in the absence of some dynamical effect\nthat would strongly discriminate the three moduli.\n\u2022 In the second case, it is the dilaton field S present in any four\u2013dimensional string (whose\nvacuum expectation value determine the magnitude of the unified coupling constant gSTR at\nthe string scale), that transmits, via its auxiliary component, the SUSY breaking. We work\nin the context of models in which string nonperturbative corrections to the K\u00e4hler potential\nact to stabilize the dilaton in the presence of gaugino condensation [21, 22].\nThe origin of the soft breaking terms are completely different in the two scenarios. Some\nare coming from the superconformal anomalies and are non\u2013universal (proportional to the beta\u2013\nfunction of the Standard Model gauge groups), others are generated in the hidden sector (from\nGreen\u2013Schwarz mechanism or gaugino condensation) and are thus universal. This mixture between\nuniversality and non\u2013universality gives the richness of the phenomenology in this type of effective\nstring models and confirms the interest of non\u2013universal studies in the prospect of supersymmetric\ndark matter detection, non\u2013universality being in this case connected with the basic properties of\nthe model.\nB.\n\nSUSY parameters and constraints\n\nIn all the models considered here, the lightest neutralino is the LSP. Its phenomenology (mainly\nthe couplings and the spectrum) is determined by its mass matrix,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nM1\n0\n\u2212mZ cos \u03b2 sin \u03b8W mZ sin \u03b2 sin \u03b8W\n\uf8ec\n0\nM2\nmZ cos \u03b2 cos \u03b8W \u2212mZ sin \u03b2 cos \u03b8W \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .\nMN = \uf8ec\n(1)\n\uf8ed \u2212mZ cos \u03b2 sin \u03b8 mZ cos \u03b2 cos \u03b8\n\uf8f8\n0\n\u2212\u03bc\nW\nW\nmZ sin \u03b2 sin \u03b8W \u2212mZ sin \u03b2 cos \u03b8W\n\u2212\u03bc\n0\n\nwritten in the (B\u0303, W\u0303 3 , H\u0303d0 , H\u0303u0 ) basis, where, B\u0303, W\u0303 3 , H\u0303d0 , H\u0303u0 represents respectively the B\u2013ino,\nW\u2013ino and down, up\u2013Higgsinos fields. M1 , M2 and \u03bc are the bino, wino, and Higgs\u2013Higgsino mass\nparameters respectively. Tan\u03b2 is the ratio of the vev of the two Higgs doublet fields. This matrix\ncan be diagonalized by a single unitary matrix z such that we can express the LSP as\n\u03c7 = z\u03c71 B\u0303 + z\u03c72 W\u0303 + z\u03c73 H\u03031 + z\u03c74 H\u03032 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe parameter \u03bc is obtained under the requirement that the electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB) takes place. This is done by computing the complete one\u2013loop corrected effective potential.\nThe effective \u03bc\u2013term is calculated from the EWSB condition after minimization of the scalar\npotential\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\nm2Hd + \u03b4m2Hd \u2212 m2Hu + \u03b4m2Hu tan2 \u03b2\ntan2 \u03b2\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\u2212 MZ2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe sign of \u03bc is not determined and left as free parameter.\nWe clearly see that the nature of the neutralino (and its couplings) depends crucially on the\nhierarchy between the parameters M1 , M2 and \u03bc.\n\n\f4\nC.\n\nThe moduli dominated scenario\n\nIn the moduli dominated scenario, the one loop order supersymmetric SUSY breaking terms at\nGUT scale can be written [17, 23, 24]:\n\nMa\nAijk\nMi2\n\n\u001a \u0014\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u03b4gs\n2\nga2 (\u03bc)\nT\n+ ba G2 (T, T )F + ba M ,\n2\n=\n2\n16\u03c0 2\n3\n1\n= \u2212 \u03b3i M \u2212 p\u03b3i G2 (T, T )F T + cyclic(ijk),\n3\n|M |2\n= (1 \u2212 p)\u03b3i\n.\n9\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere Ma and Mi are the soft masses for the gauginos and scalars and Ai , the trilinear coupling.\nba is the beta\u2013function coefficient for the gauge group Ga :\n1\nba =\n16\u03c0 2\n\n3Ca \u2212\n\nX\ni\n\nCai\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Ca , Cai are the quadratic Casimir operators for the group Ga in the adjoint representation\nand in the representation of the field i respectively. F S and F T are the auxiliary fields for the\ndilaton and the K\u00e4hler modulus, respectively, M is the supergravity auxiliary fields whose vacuum\nexpectation value (vev) determines the gravitino mass m3/2 = \u2212 13 M , and \u03b4GS is the Green\u2013Schwarz\ncoefficient which is a (negative) integer between 0 and \u221290. The function G2 (T, T ) is proportional\nto the Eisenstein function and vanishes when T is stabilized at one of its two self\u2013dual points.\nFrom Eq.(4), it follows that when the moduli are stabilized at a self dual point, only the second\nterm contributes to gaugino masses. This is precisely the \"anomaly mediated\" contribution. The\nloop contributions have been computed using the Pauli\u2013Villars (PV) regularization procedure.\nThe PV regular fields mimic the heavy string modes that regulate the full string amplitude. The\nphenomenological parameter p which represents the effective modular weight of the PV fields is\nconstrained to be not larger than 1, though it can be negative in value. Thus the scalar squared\nmass for all matter fields is in general non\u2013zero and positive at one loop (only the Higgs can have\na negative running squared mass). The limiting case of p = 1, where the scalar masses are zero at\none loop level and for which we recover a sequestered sector limit, occurs when the regulating PV\nfields and the mass\u2013generating PV fields have the same dependance on the K\u00e4hler moduli. Another\nreasonable possibility is that the PV masses are independent of the moduli, in which case we would\nhave p = 0. and \u03b3i is related to the anomalous dimension through \u03b3ij = \u03b3i \u03b4ij . (see [17, 18, 20] for\nnotations and conventions)\nWe clearly see in these formulae the competition between universal terms and non\u2013universal\nones. The scalar mass terms are all non\u2013universal and proportional to their anomalous dimension\nand thus loop suppressed. The Green-Schwarz mechanism generates universal breaking terms for\nthe gauginos (proportional to \u03b4GS ) whereas superconformal anomalies introduce non\u2013universal\ncontributions (proportional to ba ). The nature of the neutralino thus depends mainly on the value\nof the Green\u2013Schwarz counterterm \u03b4GS , whereas the mass scale is the gravitino mass m3/2 . We\nillustrate in Figs.1 the neutralino mass and its relic density as a function of \u03b4GS , vertical directions\ncorrespond to different values of m3/2 .\n\n\f5\nModuli : M\u03c7 vs \u03b4GS\n\nModuli : Oh2 vs \u03b4GS\n2\n\ntan \u03b2 =5\n\n1200\n\ntan \u03b2 =5\n\ntan \u03b2 =35\n\ntan \u03b2 =35\n1\n\nlog10 (\u03a9 h2)\n\nM \u03c7 (GeV)\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n0\n\nWMAP\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n200\n\n0\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n-4\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n\u03b4GS\n\n\u03b4GS\n\na)\n\nb)\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: a) Neutralino mass b) Relic density as a function of \u03b4GS for t = 0.25, p = 0, tan \u03b2 = 5 in blue\ncrosses (resp. 35 in red boxes) and 0\u00a1m3/2 \u00a110 (resp. 20) TeV.

It is well known that if we use the standard K\u00e4hler potential derived from\nthe tree level string theory, it is very difficult to stabilize the dilaton at acceptable weak\u2013coupling\nvalues. We postulate, in our study, nonperturbative correction of stringy origin to the dilaton\nK\u00e4hler potential. In that case, one condensate can stabilize the dilaton at weak coupling, while\nsimultaneously ensuring vanishing expectation values at the minimum of the potential. The key\nfeature of such models is the deviation of the dilaton K\u00e4hler metric from its tree level value. If\nwe imagine the superpotential for the dilaton having the form W (S) \u221d e\u22123S/b+ , with b+ being\nthe largest beta\u2013function coefficient among the condensing gauge groups of the hidden sector,\nthen we are led to consider the phenomenology of models given by the following pattern of soft\nsupersymmetry breaking terms [17, 23, 24]:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0003\n\u0002\nga2 (\u03bc) 2\nba M + 1 \u2212 2b\u2032a Ks F S\n2\n3\n\b\n\u0002\n\u0003\nKs\n1\n= \u2212 F S \u2212 \u03b3i M + \u03b3\u0303i F S ln(\u03bc2pv /\u03bc2R ) \u2212 p ln (t + t\u0304)|\u03b7(t)|4 + (ijk)\n3 \uf8ee\n3 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f9\n2\nX\nX jk\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0001\n|M | \uf8f0\n=\n\u03b3ia \u2212 2\n\u03b3i \uf8f8 ln(\u03bc2pv /\u03bc2R ) \u2212 p ln (t + t\u0304)|\u03b7(t)|4 \uf8fb\n1 + \u03b3i \u2212 \uf8ed\n9\na\njk\n\u001a\n\u001b\nS\nMF\n+ \u03b3\ne\n+ h.c. ,\n6\n\nMa =\nAijk\nMi2\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03bcuv is an ultraviolet regularization scale (of the order of the string scale MSTR ) and \u03bcR the\nrenormalization scale (taken at the boundary value of MGUT )[56].

If we look at formulae (8) and (10), it is clear that we are in a domain of heavy\nsquarks and sleptons (of the order of magnitude of the gravitino mass) and relatively light gauginos.\nIndeed, the factor b+ , as it contains a loop factor, can suppress the magnitude of the auxiliary field\nF S relative to that of the supergravity auxiliary field M through the relation (11). The resulting\ngaugino soft breaking terms are less universal for low values of b+ . We illustrate neutralino mass\nand relic density as a function of b+ in Figs.2.\nIII.\n\nSUPERSYMMETRIC DARK MATTER PHENOMENOLOGY\nA.\n\nRelic density\n\nThe relic density of neutralinos depends on their composition. In a large parameter space of\nthe mSUGRA model, the bino\u2013like nature of the lightest neutralino \u03c7 implies a rather low rate of\nannihilation.\nDifferent processes lead to interesting neutralino relic density. Let us begin with a brief survey.\nFor a bino neutralino one needs sfermion coannihilation or annihilation into the pseudo-scalar A to\n\n\f7\nhave a cosmologically favoured abundance of neutralino. If the lightest neutralino has a dominant\nwino component the relic density drops because of efficient annihilations into gauge bosons as well\nas strong \u03c7\u03c7+\n1 coannihilations. For a non negligible higgsino component, the neutralino annihilates\n0\ninto gauge bosons or tt\u0304 and relic density is also decreased by \u03c7\u03c7+\n1 and \u03c7\u03c72 coannihilations.\nIn Fig.1 (resp. 2), decreasing \u03b4GS (resp. b+ ) in the moduli (resp. dilaton) dominated scenario\ncorresponds to going from a dominant wino (resp. bino) to a dominant bino (resp. higgsino)\ncomponent. The theoretically predicted relic density can be checked against cosmological observations. In particular, recent data on the cosmological microwave background (CMB) from the\nWMAP satellite [26] constrain the dark matter relic density to be (at the 2\u03c3 level) in the range\n\u03a9CDM h2 = 0.1126+0.0161\n\u22120.0181 . We indicate on Figs 1b) and 2b) the WMAP favoured range, keeping in\nmind that the relic density calculation is very sensitive to SUSY mass and coupling uncertainties.\nIn the following, we plot models in a generous range of relic density 0.03 < \u03a9h2 < 0.3, indicating\nalso the WMAP constraint.\nB.\n\nDark matter profiles\n\nA crucial ingredient for the calculation of annihilation fluxes is the density profile of dark matter,\nwhich is usually parameterized as\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n(r/R)\u03b3 [1\n\n\u03c10\n.\n+ (r/R)\u03b1 ](\u03b2\u2212\u03b3)/\u03b1\n\n(13)\n\nwhere r is the galacto-centric coordinate, R is a characteristic length and \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are free\nparameters. Unfortunately, large uncertainties are associated with such profiles, especially in the\ninnermost regions of galaxies, i.e. regions where, in many cases, most of the signal comes from.\nN-body simulations suggest the existence of 'cuspy' profiles, following a power law \u03c1(r) = r \u2212\u03b3\nwhere \u03b3 should be \u223c 1 at small radii, although its exact value is under debate. Several groups\ntried to reproduce the initial results of Navarro, Frenk & White [27], who found \u03b3 = 1, but reached\ndifferent conclusions. In Tab. I we give the values of the parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) for some of the most\nwidely used profile models, namely the Kravtsov et al. (Kra, [28] ), Navarro, Frenk and White\n(NFW, [27]), Moore et al. (Moore, [29]) and modified isothermal (Iso, e.g. [30]) profiles. The\nmost recent N-body simulations (Hayashi et al 2003) suggest that profiles do not approach power\nlaws with a well defined index at very small radii. Profiles continue to become shallower, i.e. the\n(negative) logarithmic slope becomes higher, when moving towards the centre.\nFurthermore, the presence of a 3.6\u00d7106 solar masses black hole lying at the Galactic Center (see\ne.g.Ref. [31]) could possibly modify the profile of dark matter, that would accrete on it producing\na so-called 'spike' [32], leading to an enhancement of the annihilation flux by several orders of\nmagnitude. The prospects of indirect detection of dark matter in presence of such a spike have\nbeen discussed in Ref. [33] (see ibid. for a discussion of the dynamical effects, recently proposed\nin literature, that could potentially destroy the spike). The observational situation is even more\nunclear. Density profiles are usually reconstructed from the observation of rotation curves of\ngalaxies, in particular of low surface brightness galaxies (LSB), that are thought to be dark matter\ndominated. de Blok et al. [34] used this method to claim the inconsistency of the observed 'flat'\nprofiles, with the cuspy profiles predicted by n-body simulations. Other groups [35, 36] claimed\ninstead that cuspy profiles are compatible with observations. Hayashi et al [37] compared the\nobservational data with their numerical simulations (not with fitting formulae of their simulations)\nand found no significant discrepancy in most cases. They attributed the remaining discrepancies\nto the difference between circular velocities and gas rotation speed in realistic triaxial halos. For\nmore information on DM profiles see Ref. [1].

The study presented\nhere is conceptually similar to the one in Ref. [38], devoted to indirect detection of Kaluza-Klein\ndark matter.\nThe observed flux of secondary particle of species i, from the annihilation of dark matter particles\nof mass M and annihilation cross section \u03c3v, from a direction \u03c8 and at energy E, can be expressed\nas (e.g. Ref. [38, 39])\nZ\ndNi 1\nd s\u03c12 (r(s, \u03c8))\n(14)\n\u03a6i (\u03c8, E) = \u03c3v\ndE 4\u03c0M 2 line of sight\nwhere dNi /dE is the spectrum of secondary particles per annihilation and r 2 = s2 +R02 \u22122lR0 cos \u03c8,\nwith R0 \u223c 8.5kpc is the solar distance to the galactic center.\nIt is customary (see [30]), in order to separate the factors depending on astrophysics from those\ndepending only on particle physics, to introduce the quantity J(\u03c8)\n1\nJ (\u03c8) =\n8.5 kpc\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0.3 GeV/cm3\n\n\u00132 Z\n\nline of sight\n\nd s\u03c12 (r(s, \u03c8)) .\n\n(15)\n\nWe then define J \u0304(\u2206\u03a9) as the average of J(\u03c8) over a spherical region of solid angle \u2206\u03a9, centered on\n \u0304\n\u03c8 = 0. The values of J(\u2206\u03a9\n= 10\u22123 ) are shown in the last column of Tab. I for the corresponding\ndensity profiles. In what follows, we assume a NFW profile : results corresponding to the other\nprofiles of Table 1) can be deduced by a rescaling of J \u0304\nWIMP annihilation in the Galactic Halo produce a flux of gamma\u2013rays, with either a continuum\n(coming from \u03c0 0 decay after the shower from hadronization of the neutralino annihilation products (quarks or gauge/higgs bosons)) or a monochromatic distribution (produced from one\u2013loop\nannihilation into \u03b3\u03b3 or Z\u03b3). Monochromatic processes are loop suppressed, and contribute little\nto the \u03b3 spectrum. But, as the neutralino can be considered at rest, the monochromatic ray is at\nan energy equal to the neutralino mass. This could be one of the most promising signals for the\ndiscovery of supersymmetry in dark matter searches.\nAt the same time, annihilating neutralinos can also generate positron fluxes. Cosmic\u2013ray electrons and positrons interact with the interstellar medium through synchrotron radiation and inverse\nCompton scattering. The observed e\u00b1 flux is dominated by primary electrons from acceleration\n\n\f9\nsites, however, 10 percent of the total flux is made of secondary electrons and positrons produced\n(in equal number) by the interaction of the primaries with the interstellar medium.\nData from HEAT (High Energy Antimatter Telescope) suggest the existence of a \"bump\" in\nthe positron flux around 10 GeV [40]. Halos of neutralinos could be a new source of positron\nexplaining this excess, as there is no standard mechanism that would produce a signal at such a\nhigh energy. However, it is difficult to reproduce the normalization of the observed positron fraction\neven assuming that fluxes are \"boosted\", e.g. because of the presence of dense DM substructures\nin the solar neighborhood (see the discussion and references in Ref. [1]). Moreover, these secondary\ne\u00b1 could propagate in the galactic magnetic field, generating synchrotron radiation (see below).\nD.\n\nExperiments\n\nUp to now, detectors have explored energy ranges above \u223c 300 GeV (ground\u2013based telescopes\nlike Whipple or Cangaroo) or below \u223c 20 GeV (EGRET). But the region which might turn to\nbe the most promising one for neutralino physics is the intermediate region (30 GeV < E\u03b3 <\n300 GeV) that will be explored by the next generation of detectors. In this paper we focus on\nthe complementarity of two type of telescope : a ground\u2013based Atmospheric \u010cerenkov Telescope\n(High Energy Stereoscopic System, HESS) and a satellite experiment (Gamma\u2013Ray Large Area\nSpace Telescope, GLAST).\nGround\u2013based and satellite experiments are complementary sources of data for supersymmetric\ndark matter searches. While satellite experiments allow for a lower energy threshold (less than 1\nGeV for GLAST), a better energy resolution and a longer exposure time, the small effective area\nof the order of the square meter limits the sensitivity to high energy photons. On the contrary,\nthe large effective areas (\u223c 0.1 km2 for HESS) of ground-based Cerenkov telescopes permit the\nmeasurement of very high energy fluxes with a higher energy threshold (E\u03b3 > 60 GeV for HESS)\nIV.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nGamma ray fluxes strongly depend on the phenomenology of the neutralino. On the other\nhand, the nature of the neutralino is determined by the fundamental parameters of the models at\nhigh scale. We first analyze the dependence of neutralino annihilation on the main parameters of\nmoduli dominated scenario (m3/2 , \u03b4GS , tan \u03b2) or dilaton dominated scenario (m3/2 , b+ ) and then\nthe resulting gamma flux dependence on these parameters. We then compare the predictions of our\nmodels with the sensitivities of present and future gamma ray experiments. All calculations are\nachieved assuming an intermediate NFW profile: the results for other distributions can be easily\ndeduced from a rescaling by using the J \u0304 values in the table I.\nA.\n\nNeutralino annihilation\nZ\n\n\u03c7+\n\n2\n]2 ), \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 W + W \u2212\nThe main neutralino annihilation processes are \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 tt\u0304 (\u03c3tt \u221d [z\u03c73(4)\n(\u03c3W W \u221d [z\u03c73(4) V12 ]2 and/or [z\u03c72 V11 ]2 where V11(2) is the wino (higgsino) component of the exA\n\nchanged chargino) and \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 bb\u0304 (\u03c3bb \u221d [z\u03c71(2) z\u03c73(4) ]2 ). Thus, both neutralino wino and higgsino\ncomponents strongly enhance annihilation. The processes are shown in Figs. 3. The opening of the\ndifferent channels obviously depends on kinematics (m\u03c7 versus mb , mW , mt ). For a dominant bino\nLSP (M1 << M2 , \u03bc), the s\u2013channel A exchange (Fig. 3d) is the only one present. This process is\ndominating for low mA especially when m\u03c7 approaches mA /2 (A\u2013pole) and is thus favored for high\n\n\f10\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\nt\n\n\u03c7\n\nZ\n\nW\n\nb\n+\n\n\u03c7\n\nA\n\n\u03c7\n\nt\na)\n\n\u03c7\n\nb\nb)\n\n\u03c7\n\ni\n\nW\n\nc)\n\nFIG. 3: The dominant Feynman graph contributing for the process \u03c7 \u03c7 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3.\n\nvalues of tan \u03b2 thanks to the bb coupling to the pseudoscalar. When kinematically allowed, annihilation into tt final state by Z exchange can be also open despite the coupling suppression. For a\nwino\u2013like neutralino (M2 << M1 , \u03bc), the annihilation into W W final state through \u03c7+\n1 exchange\n+\n(Fig. 3c) is dominant thanks to the \u03c7\u03c71 W coupling and its propagator factor (m\u03c7 \u223c M2 \u223c m\u03c7+ ).\nFor an higgsino\u2013like neutralino (\u03bc << M1 , M2 ), when m\u03c7 > mt , the Z exchange (tt\u0304 final state)\nis enhanced through the \u03c7\u03c7Z coupling. But for even lower values of \u03bc (i.e neutralino mass), tt\nfinal state is kinematically closed, and the neutralinos self annihilate into W + W \u2212 or bb (when\nm\u03c7 < mW ) final states.\nThe differential energy spectrum of the photon depends a lot on the primary product of the\nneutralino annihilation. The gamma\u2013ray spectrum was simulated in [54] and fitted well with the\nfunction dN\u03b3 /dx = ae\u2212bx /x1.5 , where x = E\u03b3 /m\u03c7 and (a, b) = (0.73, 7.76) for W W and ZZ,\n(1.0, 10.7) for bb, (1.1, 15.1) for tt, and (0.95, 6.5) for uu. As we will see later on, final states with\ngauge boson will produce the harder spectrum.\nB.\n\nGamma-ray flux in the moduli dominated scenario\n\nThe integrated gamma flux gives a good understanding of the phenomenological aspects of the\nmoduli sector of the theory.\nAs an illustration, dominant annihilation branching ratios are represented as a function of\n\u03b4GS and m3/2 in Figs. 4 for tan \u03b2 = 35 (and in appendix Figs. 12 for tan \u03b2 = 5) without any\nexperimental cut on the parameter space. We also show in Fig. 5a the integrated (from 1GeV to\nm\u03c7 ) gamma flux for a NFW halo profile as a function of the Green\u2013Schwarz counterterm \u03b4GS for\ntwo values of tan\u03b2 (5,35) and m3/2 = 10 TeV. To complete our illustration, we have plotted in Fig.\n5b the mass spectrum 2m\u03c7 and MA for the same set of parameters. The mass of the neutralino\n(increasing with |\u03b4GS |, Eq. 4) and its nature (from wino to bino with increasing |\u03b4GS |) determine\nin a large part the integrated flux. Indeed the LSP is mainly bino\u2013like for \u221220 < \u03b4GS < \u22123 and\nwino\u2013like[57] for \u22123 < \u03b4GS < 0.\nFig. 5a illustrates first the general increase of the flux as a function of \u03b4GS , due to the decrease\nof the neutralino mass (Fig. 5b). For \u03b4GS running from -10 to -4, we observe a higher flux for\nhigher tan\u03b2 because the A\u2013pole channel is kinematically open for \u03b4GS \u223c \u22125 at tan \u03b2 = 35 (value\nof \u03b4GS that gives 2m\u03c7 > MA ). This process produces a large amount of bb final states (Fig. 4)\nthanks to the coupling Abb, proportional to tan\u03b2. The low tan\u03b2 (Fig. 12) dominant channel\nm m\nis the tt, proportional to mt 2 \u03c7 . For \u22122 < \u03b4GS < 0, the neutralino is entirely wino, leading to\nZ\n\nannihilation into W W (Fig. 4). Indeed, a crude approximation tell us that the W W cross section\n4 (\u223c 1 for \u03b4\nis proportional to z\u03c72\nGS = \u22121) and the annihilation into tt, proportional to the square\n\u00032\n\u0002 2\n2\nof the \u03c7\u03c7Z coupling ( z\u03c73 + z\u03c74 \u223c 10\u22125 for \u03b4GS = \u22124.).

Since b+ does not depend\non the gauge group indices of the Standard Model SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), it contributes universally\nto the gaugino mass breaking terms. Thus, the phenomenology of dilaton scenarios at large b+ in\nthe gaugino sector is similar to the one of the moduli dominated models at large |\u03b4GS |. The scalar\nsector is responsible of most of the phenomenological differences.

The main consequences are heavier pseudoscalar[58] A and MH\nu\nscale, that drives the \u03bc parameter to lower values, especially in high tan\u03b2 regimes, Eq.(3).\nAs in the moduli dominated scenario, we show the dominant annihilation branching ratios,\nin the (b+ , m3/2 , ) plane for tan \u03b2 = 35 in Figs.6 (and in appendix in Figs.13 for tan \u03b2 = 5) to\nhighlight the different annihilation channel dependence on fundamental parameter.

It acts on M3 through the F S\ncontribution with a different sign contribution than the superconformal contribution proportional\n2 . Lower b\nto b3 (Eq. (8). Thus, lowering b+ acts through the M3 dependence of the RGE on MH\n+\nu\n2\nmeans lower M3 , Eq.(8) leading to higher MHu through the RGE implying a lower \u03bc parameter,\nEq.(3): neutralino is mainly higgsino for b+ < 0.1(0.3) and tan\u03b2=5 (35) as we can see in Fig. 7b.\nThough quite low, its wino component is not completely negligible.\nFor a fixed value of m3/2 , decreasing b+ lead to a higher higgsino fraction favoring W W , ZZ\nchannels and the tt\u0304 one when kinematically open (i.e for high m3/2 values) compared to the bb\u0304\nchannel. For low m3/2 values the wino component also favors the W W channel. When m\u03c7 < mW ,\nannihilation into bb\u0304 is completely dominant, the other processes being kinematically closed. This\nis illustrated on Figs. 6 for tan \u03b2 = 35 and in appendix Fig. 13 for tan \u03b2 = 5. For a given m3/2 ,\nhigher values of tan\u03b2 give better fluxes because it enhances the higgsino fraction of the neutralino\nthrough Eq.(3). The neutralino mass increasing with b+ (Fig.2a) explains the general evolution\nof the gamma flux (\u221d m12 \u223c M1 2 ) (Fig. 7a).

For that purpose, we have\ncomputed the total gamma flux as a function\nof m\n\u0003\n\u0003 \u03c7 for three values of tan\u03b2, scanning\n\u0002 on the two\n\u0002\nother main parameters of each model ( m3/2 , \u03b4GS in the moduli dominated case and m3/2 , b+ in\nthe dilaton dominated one).

See the text for the\ncomments.\n\n\u2022 For a f ixed value of tan \u03b2 and a given profile density, the regions covered by the two models\ndo not overlap. In other words, if we obtain the value of tan \u03b2 by another experiment, the\nmeasurement of the gamma-ray flux will allow to distinguish or even exclude SUSY breaking\nscenarios.\n\u2022 The flux is a decreasing function of the LSP mass, independently of the specific model\nadopted (see eq. 14): a heavier neutralino has a lower number density in the halo, and so a\nlower flux. Except some possible threshold effects, this is a general remark for any nature of\nindirect fluxes coming from neutralino annihilation at the Galactic Center. On the contrary,\nfor lighter neutralino (dilaton\u2013dominated scenario and mSugra) the threshold effect implies\nan increasing flux with m\u03c7 . This effect is evaded for m\u03c7 & mt , when the tt\u0304 channel is open.\n\u2022 Fluxes in the dilaton breaking scenario are higher than in the moduli scenario (except for high\ntan\u03b2 because of the A\u2013pole contribution, see below). The highest flux in moduli dominated\ncase is obtained for low |\u03b4GS | (Fig. 5a), where the neutralino is completely wino but does not\nhave a sufficient relic density to fulfill the dark matter content of the universe (see Fig.1).\nThose points are excluded by our cut on \u03a9 > 0.03. The remaining ones are situated in the\nnear\u2013zone \"stau LSP\" branch of Figs. 4 and 12.\nIn the dilaton dominated breaking scenario, most of the points are excluded at low m\u03c7 because\nthey do not respect the accelerator constraints on m\u03c7+ (and mh ), whereas heavy neutralinos are\n1\nforbidden by the closed parameter space limited by the gaugino condensation group \u03b2\u2013function\ncoefficient b+ (b+ \u2264 bE8 \u223c 0.57). This parameter space is larger for lower values of tan\u03b2 because\nbarely constrained by the realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking condition (\u03bc2 > 0).\nMost of the points with low integrated flux are excluded when imposing a higher limit on the relic\ndensity (\u03a9\u03c7 < 0.3). This is due to the correlation between the fluxes and the relic density.

This explains the correlation between the dilaton and mSUGRA\nclouds on Fig. 9.\nIn the moduli dominated scenario, the dependence on tan \u03b2 is not only due to the mass spectrum\nor a larger parameter space, but to the annihilation processes governing the gamma\u2013ray fluxes.\nIndeed, in the moduli breaking scenario, one can have a relatively light pseudo scalar A. The\nA\nannihilation of the neutralino is thus dominated by the s channel \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 bb with a branching ratio\napproaching the 90 percents in most cases (the coupling Abb \u221d tan\u03b2, gives a factor 50 in \u03c3 between\ntan\u03b2 = 5 and 35). We can notice that thanks to the \u03b4GS parameter the A\u2013pole can be obtained\nfor lower value of tan \u03b2 than in mSUGRA.\nTo study the observability of these fluxes, we have estimated the total gamma\u2013ray flux above\n60 GeV, and compared it with the predicted sensitivity of the HESS experiment (Figs. 8b and 9b).\nThe low neutralino mass region (< 400 GeV)is not accessible to EGRET but will be explored by\nGLAST, whereas HESS will give more precise information for a heavy neutralino. In that sense,\nGLAST and HESS experiments are complementary. Indeed, evading the NFW profile assumption\nand taking a less cuspy density, the GLAST accessible region of our models is much less overlapping\nthe HESS one. For instance, assuming a NFW profile, a non discovery of any signal in HESS and\nGLAST will exclude any dilaton dominated scenario and the high tan\u03b2 regime of the moduli\ndomination.\nFinally, in the framework of effective heterotic models proposed in this paper, concerning direct\nand solar neutrino indirect detection, points satisfying all constraints in the dilaton case were all\naccessible to experiments whereas moduli was not [19]. Concerning gamma indirect detection, the\nconclusion depends strongly on the halo profile assumption. For a NFW shape, the dilaton model\nis still the most attractive for detection but the moduli one can also be tested by experiment. In\nthat sense, gamma indirect detection is less an explicit test of SUSY breaking scenario but a very\ncomplementary way to give some hints on particles physics hypothesis and dark halo astrophysical\nassumptions.\n\n\f17\nWe close this section by showing \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 line results on Figs. 10. Because dark mater\nin the halo is extremely non\u2013relativistic, photons from these processes have an energy width of\nonly \u2206E\u03b3 /E\u03b3 \u223c 10\u22123 and are effectively mono\u2013energetic. While this signal would be the most\nspectacular of all possible indirect signals, as we can see in Figs. 10 the processes being loopsuppressed are much too low to be detected, even in any string scenario studied here. On another\nhand, the integrated flux explored before is more observable, but far less distinctive and will\ncertainly require additional confirmation to unambiguously distinguish it from the background or\nother exotic sources.\nV.\n\nSYNCHROTRON RADIATION\n\nAnother interesting source for the indirect search of DM in the Galactic halo is the detection\nof the neutralino via the synchrotron radiation created by the propagation of the e\u00b1 products of\nneutralino annihilation, around the Galactic magnetic field. In our study, we have considered a\nmagnetic field at equipartition at the Galactic center and constant elsewhere [38]\n#\n\"\n\u0012 \u0013\u22125/4\nr\n, 6\u03bcG\n(16)\nB(r) = max 324\u03bcG\npc\nmeaning that the field is constant for galacto-centric distances r > 0.23 pc.\nLower values of the magnetic field imply a shift of the synchrotron spectrum toward lower\nenergies. As a consequence, the flux at low frequency will increase, favoring the detectability of\nour models. Nevertheless, we prefer to be conservative and consider a B field at equipartition.\nThe synchrotron flux per solid angle at a given frequency \u03bd is given by [38]\n\nL\u03bd (\u03c8) \u223c\n\n1 9\n4\u03c0 8\n\n\u0012\n\n1 m3e c4\n0.29\u03c0 e\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03c3v\nYe (M, \u03bd)\u03bd 1/2 I(\u03c8),\nM2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n\nI(\u03c8) =\n\nZ\n\nds\u03c12 (r(s, \u03c8))B \u22121/2 (r(s, \u03c8)),\n\n(18)\n\nline of sight\n\nand s is the coordinate running along the line of sight. Ye (M, \u03bd) is the average number of secondary\nelectrons above the energy Em (\u03bd) of the electron giving the maximum contribution at a given\nfrequency \u03bd and given magnetic field B.

In fact, it has been shown in Ref. [38] that in a NFW profile, the optical\ndepth \u03c4 can be safely neglected unless very low frequencies are considered (of order \u223c 1 Hz),\nwhich is not our case. Concerning the electron absorption, the authors of [38] observed that the\nabsorption coefficient per length is such that \u03b1\u03bd < 6 10\u221216 pc\u22121 (B/\u03bcG)(\u03bd/GHz)\u22122 , justifying our\napproximation.\nIn any case, for a NFW halo profile, the fluxes obtained for the models considered here do\nnot constrain the mass of the DM particle, contrary to what happens in the case of Kaluza-Klein\nparticles [38]. Naturally, the synchrotron flux shapes we obtain are similar to what we obtain for\n\u03b3 fluxes due to the same \u03c3v dependence, but the resulting values in the case of a NFW profile\nare several orders of magnitudes lower than experimental constraints. Recently, the calculation\nof synchrotron radiation from neutralino annihilation has been revisited [55]. Unfortunately the\nprocesses described there are not sufficient to make the flux in our models observable.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied gamma-ray and synchrotron emission from the Galactic center, in the context\nof an effective string inspired framework, and discussed two scenarios: in the first one, the SUSY\nbreaking is transmitted by the compactification moduli T \u03b1 ; while in second one, it is transmitted by\nthe dilaton field S, via their respective auxiliary fields. Typically, models in the dilaton dominated\nSUSY breaking scenario lead to a higher annihilation rate than the moduli scenario. Concerning\nthe continuum gamma-ray flux, both scenarios are within the reach of the experimental sensitivities\nof GLAST and HESS for a NFW halo profile. For the same profile, the gamma-ray line signal is\nsuppressed and beyond the experimental sensitivity.\nThe synchrotron emission is too low to be constrained by experiments even with a more cuspy\nprofile. Due to the dependence of the prospects of detection on both theoretical high energy physics\n\n\f19\nassumptions and astrophysical parameters of the halo dark matter distribution, gamma-ray indirect detection of neutralino dark matter can give interesting information either on astrophysical\nhypotheses or on the SUSY breaking scenario by the complementarity with other experimental\nsearches like direct detection or neutrino telescopes (studied in [19] in the same context) or accelerators.\n\nAcknowledgments\nE.N. would like to thank J.
