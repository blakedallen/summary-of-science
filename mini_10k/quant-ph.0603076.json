Pomorska 149/153, 90 - 236 L\u00f3d\u017a, Poland.\nAbstract\nThe Margolus-Levitin lower bound on minimal time required for a state to\nbe transformed into an orthogonal state is generalized. It is shown that for some\ninitial states new bound is stronger than the Margolus-Levitin one.\n\n1\n\n\fA useful measure of the evolution speed of quantum systems is the minimal time t1\nrequired for a state to be transformed into an orthogonal state. There exist two basic\nestimates of t1 .\nFirst, t1 obeys\n\u03c0~\n(1)\n2\u2206E\nwhere \u2206E is energy dispersion of initial state. Eq. (1) follows easily from the inequality\nderived by Mandelstam and Tamm and was studied by many authors [2] \u00f7 [7].\nThe second estimate has been derived few years ago by Margolus and Levitin [8].\nIt is valid for Hamiltonians bounded from below and reads\n\u03c0~\nt1 \u2265\n;\n(2)\n2hE \u2212 E0 i\nt1 \u2265\n\nhere h i denotes the initial state expectation value while E0 is a ground - state energy.\nBoth eqs. (1) and (2) can be derived using similar arguments [8], [9]. By virtue of\nthe spectral theorem one writes\nZ\n\u2212itE\n\u2212itH\n~\n| \u03a8i = e ~ dh\u03a8 | PE | \u03a8i =\nh\u03a8 | e\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\nZ\ntE\ntE\n= cos\ndh\u03a8 | PE | \u03a8i \u2212 i sin\ndh\u03a8 | PE | \u03a8i\n(3)\n~\n~\n\nRwhere PE is the spectral measure which enters spectral decomposition of H, H =\nEdPE . Therefore, denoting h\u03a8 | A | \u03a8i \u2261 hAi, one gets\n\u0013\u001d\n\u001c \u0012\n\u0013\u001d\n\u001c \u0012\nt1 H\nt1 H\n= 0 = sin\n(4)\ncos\n~\n~\n\nNow, consider an inequality of the form\nf (x) \u2265 A sin x + B cos x\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is assumed to hold for all x \u2265 0 (actually, in order to prove (1) one demands (5)\nto hold for all x). Denoting by E0 the lower energy bound one finds from eq. (5)\n\u001c \u0012\n\u0013\u001d\n\u001c \u0012\n\u0013\u001d\n\u001c \u0012\n\u0013\u001d\nt(H \u2212 E0 )\nt(H \u2212 E0 )\nt(H \u2212 E0 )\nf\n\u2265 A sin\n+ B cos\n(6)\n~\n~\n~\n\u0011\n\u0010\n0)\n. Indeed, eq.(6) follows easily\nprovided | \u03a8i belongs to the domain of f t(H\u2212E\n~\nfrom the inequality (5) by noting that the expectation value of nonnegative function\nis nonnegative\n\u001c \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001d\nt(H \u2212 E0 )\nt(H \u2212 E0 )\nt(H \u2212 E0 )\nf\n\u2212 A sin\n\u2212 B cos\n=\n~\n~\n~\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ h \u0012\nt(E \u2212 E0 )\nt(E \u2212 E0 )\n=\nf\n\u2212 A sin\n\u2212\n~\n~\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt(E \u2212 E0 ) i\n\u2212B cos\ndh\u03a8 | PE | \u03a8i \u2265 0\n(7)\n~\n2\n\n\fIn particular, eqs. (4) and (6) imply\n\u0013\u001d\n\u001c \u0012\nt1 (H \u2212 E0 )\n\u22650\nf\n~\n\n(8)\n\nwhich imposes some restrictions on t1 .\nIn order to derive a new bound on t1 we use the following inequality\nx\u03b1 \u2212\n\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\n+\ncos x + \u03b1\u03c0 \u03b1\u22121 sin x \u2265 0\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhich holds for all x \u2265 0 and \u03b1 > 0. Note that eq.(9) provides a generalization of the\ninequality used in Ref. [8]; it reduces to the latter for \u03b1 = 1.\nBy virtue of eq. (8), eq. (9) leads to the following bound on t1 :\n\u03c0~\n\nt1 \u2265\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n2 h(E \u2212 E0 )\u03b1 i \u03b1\n\n,\n\n\u03b1>0\n\n(10)\n\nprovided | \u03a8i belongs to the domain of (H \u2212E0 )\u03b1 . Eq. (10) provides the generalization\nof Margolus - Levitin bound which is attained for \u03b1 = 1.\nThe estimate (10) is for fixed \u03b1 6= 1 neither weaker nor stronger than the Margolus\n- Levitin one. Indeed, although the convexity (concavity) of x \u2192 x\u03b1 for \u03b1 > 1 (\u03b1 < 1)\n1\n1\n1\nallows us to claim that hE \u03b1 i \u03b1 \u2265 hEi (hE \u03b1 i \u03b1 \u2264 hEi), the additional factor 2 \u03b1 makes\napriori estimate impossible. Obviously, one could take the supremum over all \u03b1 > 0\nof the right hand side of (10). However, this is only possible for | \u03a8i belonging to the\ndomains of all (H \u2212 E0 )\u03b1 , \u03b1 > 0.\nIn order to show that, in some cases, the inequality (10) gives much better bound\nfor some \u03b1 6= 1 one can use a simple example considered in Ref. [8]. Let us take the\ninitial state of the form\na\nb\n| \u03a8i = \u221a (| 0i+ | \u03b5i) + \u221a (| n\u03b5i+ | (n + 1)\u03b5i);\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nnormalization condition implies | a |2 + | b |2 = 1.\nOne easily checks that\nt1 =\n\n\u03c0~\n\u03b5\n\n(12)\n\nComputing the relevant expectation value one obtains\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(13)\n2 \u03b1 h(E \u2212 E0 )\u03b1 i \u03b1 = (1+ | b |2 (n\u03b1 + (n + 1)\u03b1 \u2212 1)) \u03b1 \u03b5\n\u221a \u221a\nwith \u03bb 6= 0 independent of n. Then, for \u03b1 = 12 , eq.(10)\nLet us choose b = \u03bb/ 2 4 n \u221a\ngives in the limit of large n ( n \u226b 1)\nt1 \u2265\n\n\u03c0~\n\u03b5(1+ | \u03bb |2 )2\n3\n\n(14)\n\n\fOn the other hand, if | \u03bb |2\n\n\u221a\n\nn \u226b 1, eq.(2) becomes\nt1 \u2265\n\n\u03c0~\n\u221a\n\u03b5 | \u03bb |2 n\n\n(15)\n\nAlso eq.(1) gives in this limit much weaker bound\n\u221a\n2\u03c0~\n\u221a\nt1 \u2265\n4\n\u03b5 | \u03bb | n3\n\n(16)\n\n1\nWe see that for the above state our bound is O(1) while (1) and (2) are O( \u221a\n4 3 ) and\nn\nO( \u221a1n ), respectively. Therefore, the new bound may be much better even for such very\nsimple systems.\nThe above example may seem quite artificial. However, it is generic in the sense that\nit allows us to understand the status of bounds based on energy distribution moments.\nIn fact, let us consider the following generalization of our example. We assume that the\nenergy spectrum consists of a number of pairs of levels differing by the same energy\namount \u03b5: spec(H) = {E0 = 0, \u03b5, E1, E1 + \u03b5, E2 , E2 + \u03b5, ...}. Consider the state for\nwhich both members of any \"doublet\" enter with the same amplitude, i.e.\nX an\nX\n\u221a (| En i+ | En + \u03b5i),\n| \u03a8i =\n| an |2 = 1\n(17)\n2\nn\nn\n\nObviously, the orthogonalization time for this state is given by eq.(12), irrespectively\nof the values of an and En , n = 0, 1, 2, .... On the other hand\n1\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n2 h(E \u2212 E0 )\u03b1 i =\n\nX\nn\n\n| an |2 (En\u03b1 + (En + \u03b5)\u03b1 )\n\n! \u03b11\n\n(18)\n\nIt is clearly seen from the above equation that our bound cannot be optimal except\nfor the small number of states (see below). However, the advantage of it is that we\nhave a free parameter \u03b1 which can be manipulated to get the best possible estimate\nfor known spectrum. As we have shown explicitly above an appropriate choice of \u03b1\ncan result in much better bound than Margolus-Levitin one.\nThe above reasoning shows also clearly that there exists no optimal bound based\non energy distribution only. The relevant moments generically depend strongly of the\nvalues Ek and ak which, in turn, are completely irrelevant as far as the orthogonalization\ntime is concerned. Therefore, it is desirable to have an apriori estimates which depend\non free parameter to be adjusted to \"minimalize\" the role of Ek and ak .\nLet us find the intelligent states saturating (10). To this end let us note that the\nLHS of eq.(9) vanishes only for x = 0 and x = \u03c0. Therefore, only two - level systems\ncan saturate (10). One easily finds that they must be of the form\n| \u03a8i = c1 | E0 i + c2 | E1 i,\n4\n\n1\n| c1 |=| c2 |= \u221a\n2\n\n(19)\n\n\fFinally, let us sketch how one can generalize our result to mixed states case. This can\nbe done according to the lines of ref. [10]. To this end, given two density matrices, one\ndefines the fidelity\n\u00132\n\u0012 q\n\u221a \u2032\u221a\n\u2032\n\u03c1\u03c1 \u03c1\n(20)\nF (\u03c1, \u03c1 ) = T r\nGiven any Hamiltonian H and an initial state \u03c1\nX\n\u03c1=\npn | \u03c6n ih\u03c6n |\n\n(21)\n\nn\n\nwe want to estimate the value of F (\u03c1, \u03c1(t)). To this end we consider some purification | \u03c7i of \u03c1,\nX\u221a\npn | \u03c6n i | \u03ben i.\n| \u03c7i =\n(22)\nn\n\nAssume that all states of an ancillary system evolve trivially in time. Then the total\nHamiltonian governing the time evolution of | \u03c7i equals H \u2297 I. Therefore, all energy\ndistribution moments with respect to | \u03c7i coincide with those with respect to \u03c1. Due\nto the Uhlmann's theorem [11] the following inequality holds\nF (\u03c1, \u03c1(t)) \u2265| h\u03c7 | \u03c7(t)i |2\n\n(23)\n\nwhich allows us to extend to the mixed state case any bound based on energy\ndistribution moments.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was supported by the University of L\u00f3d\u017a grants N o 690 and 795.
