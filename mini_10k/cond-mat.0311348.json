A parallelepipedshaped quantum dot is considered as a model for a self-assembled quantum dot in a stack. The\nexciton-phonon interaction is taken into account for all phonon modes specific for these quantum\ndots (bulk-like, half-space and interface phonons). We show that the coupling between stacked\nquantum dots can lead to a strong enhancement of the optical absorption in the spectral ranges\ncharacteristic for phonon satellites.\nPACS numbers: 78.67.Hc,73.21.La,73.21.-b\n\nNon-adiabaticity is an inherent property of exciton-phonon systems in various quantum-dot structures. Nonadiabaticity drastically enhances the efficiency of the exciton-phonon interaction. The effects of non-adiabaticity are\nimportant to interpret the surprisingly high intensities of the phonon 'sidebands' observed in the optical absorption,\nthe photoluminescence and the Raman spectra of quantum dots, in particular, an enhancement of these intensities with\ndecreasing the quantum-dot size (see, e. g., Refs. 1,2). Deviations of intensities of the phonon-peak sidebands, observed\nin some experimental optical spectra, from the Franck-Condon progression, which is prescribed by the commonly\nused adiabatic approximation, find a natural explanation within our non-adiabatic approach3,4,5,6 . Recently, stacked\nquantum dots have received increasing attention (see, e. g., Refs. 7,8,9,10,11,12,13) due to the possibility to finely\ncontrol their energy spectra. This makes stacked quantum dots very promising for future nanodevices12,13 . In the\npresent work, the non-adiabatic approach is applied to stacked InAs/GaAs quantum dots, which reveal a richer\nstructure of phonon and exciton spectra in comparison with those for a single quantum dot.\nIn order to model coupled self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots, we consider a stack of N parallelepiped-shaped\nquantum dots with sizes lx , ly , lz and interdot distance d along the z-axis. Within the present approach, the lateral\nsizes (lx , ly ) of each quantum dot in a stack are supposed to be much larger than its size lz along the growth axis.\nThe stack is a system of (2N + 1) layers (n = 1, . . . 2N + 1) with parameters\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 ln = lz , \u03b5n = \u03b5InAs for n = 2, 4, . . . , 2N ;\nln = d, \u03b5n = \u03b5GaAs for n = 3, 5, . . . , 2N \u2212 1;\n\uf8f3 l \u2192 \u221e, \u03b5 = \u03b5\nn\nn\nGaAs for n = 1, 2N + 1.\nThe bulk-like optical-phonon frequencies in InAs and GaAs layers of the stacked InAs/GaAs quantum dots coincide\nwith the LO-phonon frequencies in InAs and GaAs, respectively. The interface frequencies belong to the stacked\nquantum dots as a whole and satisfy the dispersion equation\ndet kakn (\u03c9)k = 0\n\n(k, n = 1, . . . 2N ) ,\n\nwhere akn (\u03c9) is the dynamic matrix of the interface vibrations with the matrix elements\n\u001a\nann (\u03c9) = \u03b5n (\u03c9) coth qk ln + \u03b5n+1 (\u03c9) coth qk ln+1 ,\nan,n\u22121 (\u03c9) = an\u22121,n (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03b5n (\u03c9) / sinh qk ln ;\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nall other matrix elements are equal to zero.\nIn Fig. 1, typical interface-phonon spectra are represented for stacked InAs/GaAs quantum dots formed by two\nInAs parallelepipeds. The frequencies are plotted as a function of the in-plane wave number qk , which takes discrete\nvalues due to the quantization of the phonons in the xy-plane. In a stack of N quantum dots, each interface-phonon\nfrequency of a single quantum dot splits into N branches. The splitting of the interface-phonon frequencies is due to\nthe electrostatic interaction between the optical polar vibrations of the different quantum dots.\nThese features of the optical-phonon spectrum of stacked quantum dots are manifested in their optical properties.\nWe calculate the optical absorption spectrum of polaronic excitons in stacked quantum dots starting from the Kubo\nformula. Within the non-adiabatic approach3 the following expression results for the linear coefficient of the optical\nabsorption by the exciton-phonon system in a quantum-dot structure:\n\u03b1(\u03a9) \u221d Re\n\nX\n\n\u03b2,\u03b2 \u2032\n\nd\u2217\u03b2 d\u03b2 \u2032\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n+\n\ndt ei(\u03a9\u2212\u03a9\u03b2 +i0\n\n)t\n\n\u03b2 \u016a (t) \u03b2 \u2032 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03a9 is the frequency of the incident light, d\u03b2 and \u03a9\u03b2 are, respectively, the electric dipole matrix element and the\nFranck-Condon frequency of a transition between the exciton vacuum state and the one-exciton state |\u03b2i. Exciton\nstates in stacked InAs/GaAs quantum dots are determined using an exact diagonalization of the exciton Hamiltonian\nwith simple parabolic valence and conduction bands within a finite-dimensional basis of the electron-hole states. The\nevolution operator averaged over the phonon ensemble, \u016a (t), is\n(\n\u0014 \u2212i\u03c9\u03bb (t1 \u2212t2 )\nZt1\nZt\n1 X\ne\n\u016a (t) = T exp \u2212 2\ndt1 dt2\n~\n1 \u2212 y\u03bb\n\u03bb 0\n0\n\u0015)\ny\u03bb ei\u03c9\u03bb (t1 \u2212t2 ) \u2020\n\u2020\n\u03b3\u03bb (t1 )\u03b3\u03bb (t2 ) .\n(4)\n\u00d7\u03b3\u03bb (t1 )\u03b3\u03bb (t2 ) +\n1 \u2212 y\u03bb\nIn Eq. (4),\nT is the time ordering operator,\nthe index \u03bb labels the phonon modes\nspecific\nfor\nthe\nquantum-dot\nstructure\nunder\nconsideration,\n\u03c9\u03bb\nare\nphonon\nfrequencies,\n\u03b3\u03bb (t) are the exciton-phonon interaction amplitudes in the interaction representation,\nand\ny\u03bb = exp (\u2212~\u03c9\u03bb /kB T ).\nWithin the adiabatic approximation, which has been widely used to calculate the optical spectra of quantum dots,\nnon-diagonal matrix elements of the exciton-phonon interaction are neglected when calculating \u03b1(\u03a9) as given by\nEq. (3) with Eq. (4). In the adiabatic approach14,15 one supposes that (i) both the initial and the final states of a\nquantum transition are non-degenerate, (ii) the energy differences between the exciton states are much larger than the\nphonon energies. It has been shown in Refs. 3,4,5,6 that these conditions are often violated for optical transitions in\nsmall quantum dots, which have sizes less than the bulk exciton radius. In other words, the exciton-phonon system in\na quantum dot can be essentially non-adiabatic. The polaron interaction for an exciton in a degenerate state results\nin internal non-adiabaticity (\"the proper Jahn\u2013Teller effect\"), while the existence of exciton levels separated by an\nenergy comparable with the LO-phonon energy leads to external non-adiabaticity (\"the pseudo Jahn\u2013Teller effect\").\nIn Ref. 3, a method was proposed to calculate the absorption spectrum given by Eqs. (3) and (4) taking into\naccount the effect of non-adiabaticity on the probabilities of phonon-assisted optical transitions. The key step is\nthe calculation of the matrix elements of the evolution operator h\u03b2 \u016a (t) \u03b2 \u2032 i. In order to describe the effect of nonadiabaticity both on the intensities and on the positions of the absorption peaks, a diagrammatic approach can be\nused. When calculating these matrix elements we take into account that in a quantum dot, due to the absence of\nmomentum conservation, the product h\u03b21 |\u03b3\u03bb |\u03b22 ih\u03b22 |\u03b3\u03bb\u2217 |\u03b23 i can be non-zero for \u03b21 6= \u03b23 , as distinct from the bulk\ncase.

The calculations where performed for low temperatures ({y\u03bb \u226a 1}) when the\nabsorption-line broadening due to the exciton-LO-phonon interaction is negligible. The broadening shown in Figs. 2\nand 3 is introduced only to enhance visualization. From the comparison of the spectra obtained in the adiabatic\napproximation with those resulting from the non-adiabatic approach, the following effects of non-adiabaticity are\nrevealed. First, the polaron shift of the zero-phonon lines with respect to the bare-exciton levels is larger in the\nnon-adiabatic approach than in the adiabatic approximation. Second, there is a strong increase of the intensities of\n\n\f4\nthe phonon satellites compared to those given by the adiabatic approximation. This increase can be by more than\ntwo orders of magnitude. Third, in the optical absorption spectra found within the non-adiabatic approach, there\nappear phonon satellites related to non-active bare exciton states.\nFourth, the optical-absorption spectra demonstrate the crucial role of non-adiabatic mixing of different exciton and\nphonon states in quantum dots. This results in a rich structure of the absorption spectrum of the exciton-phonon\nsystem4,5,16 . For the stacked quantum dots, this effect is enhanced in the (quasi-) resonant case, when the exciton-level\nsplitting, caused by the coupling between quantum dots, is close to a LO phonon energy [see panel (b) in Fig. 3].\nSimilar conclusions about the influence of the exciton-phonon interaction on the optical spectra of quantum dots have\nbeen recently formulated in Ref. 17 for the \"strong coupling regime\" for excitons and LO phonons. Such a \"strong\ncoupling regime\" is a particular case of the non-adiabatic mixing related to a (quasi-) resonance, which arises when\nthe spacing between exciton levels is close to the LO phonon energy.\nIn some cases (see, e. g., Ref. 3) the luminescence spectrum of a quantum dot can be easily derived from its\nabsorption spectrum. E. g., under the assumption that the distribution function of the states of an exciton coupled\nto the phonon field, f (\u03a9), depends only on the energy of a state, the luminescence intensity at low temperatures\n({y\u03bb \u226a 1}) can be represented as\n!\n\u221e\nK\nX\nX\nX\n1\nI(\u03a9) \u221d\nf \u03a9+\n\u03c9\u03bbk\nK!\nK=0\n\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbK\nk=0\n!\nK\nY\n\u2202\n\u03b1(\u03a9)\n.\n(17)\n\u00d7\n\u2202y\u03bbk\nk=1\n\n{y\u03bb \u21920}\n\nEquation (17) is applicable, for instance, for thermodynamic equilibrium photoluminescence. In this case the radiative\nlifetime of an exciton is much larger than the time characteristic of radiationless relaxation between one-exciton states.\nWe have calculated the spectra of thermodynamic equilibrium luminescence (not shown here) for quantum dots\nwith parameters indicated above. Both for single and for coupled quantum dots, the intensities of phonon satellites\nin these spectra are significantly smaller than in the absorption spectrum. This is because in quantum dots under\nconsideration the lowest one-exciton energy level (with \u03b2 = 1) is less affected by the phonon-induced non-adiabatic\nmixing of states than higher levels. The luminescence spectrum at low temperatures is dominated by transitions from\nthe state with \u03b2 = 1, while the absorption spectrum contains appreciable contributions due to transitions to higher\nexciton-phonon states.\nDue to non-adiabaticity, multiple absorption peaks appear in the spectral ranges characteristic for phonon satellites.\nFrom the states, which correspond to these peaks, the system can rapidly relax to the lowest emitting state. Therefore,\nin the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of quantum dots, pronounced peaks can be expected in spectral\nranges characteristic for phonon satellites. Experimental evidence of the enhanced phonon-assisted absorption due\nto non-adiabaticity has been recently provided by PLE measurements on single self-assembled InAs/GaAs18 and\nInGaAs/GaAs19 quantum dots. Our results, which imply significantly more pronounced phonon satellites in PLE\nspectra compared to the luminescence spectra from the lowest one-exciton state, are in line with the experimental\nobservations18,19 .\nThis work has been supported by the GOA BOF UA 2000, I.U.A.P., F.W.O.-V. projects G.0274.01N, G.0435.03,\nthe W.O.G.
