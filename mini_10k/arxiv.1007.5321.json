Still,\nmany issues remain unclear such as the the pairing mechanism, pairing symmetry, gap structure and the nature of\nthe magnetism. As the electron-phonon coupling seems\nto be inadequate to account for the relatively high transition temperatures,2 electronic interactions will likely play\na role in the pair formation. Based on the experience\nin high temperature cuprates, organic superconductors,\nand heavy fermion superconductors with their commonality of proximity to magnetism, comparative analyses\nhave been made to show the similarities and differences\nbetween different classes of superconductors.3 This directs the attention to the long discussed magnetic pairing mechanism.4 Renormalization group studies5,6 on the\niron pnictides show that the underlying electronic structure, when close to perfect nesting, develops an unconventional pairing interaction enabled by interband pairhopping and further amplified by antiferromagnetic correlations. Therefore electronic and magnetic fluctuations, which are active in the vicinity of magnetic transition, have been listed as one of the candidates to mediate\nCooper pairs in the material.5\u201310 The pairing symmetry\nand gap structure are among the most interesting topics as they contain most relevant information on pairing\nmechanism. However there is no consensus on them when\nexplored using different experimental methods and in different members of the material. Further, although being\n\nconsidered as layered structure, the material should be\nconsidered anisotropic, but three dimensional. Some evidence shows gap nodes along the c-axis.11 Even for the\nin-plane gap structure, some experiments support fully\ngapped structure and some indicate in-plane gap nodes.\nTheoretical explorations suggest the strongest pairing instability corresponds to the sign-reversed s\u00b1 -wave state,\nwithout ruling out other forms like d-wave and conventional s-wave. Even in the sign-reversed s\u00b1 state, depending on detailed Fermi surface (FS) configuration,\ndifferent form factors of the Cooper pair could be developed, resulting in either fully gapped s\u00b1 -wave spectrum\non all FS sheets or nodal s\u00b1 -wave with sign change on\nthe electron pockets.12\u201314 Besides, associated with the\nmultiband character, evidence of multiple gaps is found\nin some systems. It has been clear that the material\nis metallic in the parent compound with well-established\nlong range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. But with noticeable electronic correlations the nature of magnetism\nis still under debate.\nThe magnetic excitation spectrum carries important\ninformation on the nature of magnetism and the characteristics of superconductivity. For the latter, it has\nbeen discussed in the context of cuprates that an observation of a sharp quasiparticle-like resonance peak in\nthe spin fluctuation spectrum with the onset of superconductivity may strongly indicate a sign change in the gap\nstructure due to the superconducting coherence factors.\nAnd the analogous discussion has been applied to the\niron pnictides15\u201318 based on the random phase approximation and the mean-field BCS approximation, showing that a strong spin resonance occurs in the s\u00b1 -wave\nSC state. This indicates that the spin resonance phe-\n\n\f2\nnomenon is compatible with the s\u00b1 -wave SC gap. Meanwhile, as a momentum resolved probe of the spin correlation, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments\nhave reported the observation of resonance mode in both\nhole-doped and electron-doped 122 system19\u201322 as well\nas in the FeTe1\u2212x Sex system.23,24 Notice that the spin\nresonance is a consequence of the sign-reversed gap opening in the quasiparticle spectrum not an evidence for the\nmagnetic pairing glue. In order to reveal the relationship\nbetween AFM fluctuations and superconductivity in the\niron-based materials, more detailed inspections on the\nstructure of the spin fluctuations are needed. Recently,\nINS measurements observe the same type of anisotropic\nfeature in the magnetic spectrum both in the normal and\nin the SC state of the 122 system.25\u201327 This anisotropy is\ncharacterized by larger broadening along the transverse\ndirection with respect to the AFM wave vector QAFM\nin momentum space. Ref.27 also shows no changes observed in the spatial correlations through Tc , which is\nconsistent with the magnetic scenario in that the onset\nof superconductivity does not change magnetic correlation length. Early theoretical exploration on the shortrange spin-fluctuation induced superconductivity has argued that magnetic fluctuations throughout an extended\nmomentum region near AFM wave vector QAFM are relevant to superconductivity. Thus it raises a question: is\nthe observed anisotropic feature of the spin fluctuations,\ni.e., larger broadening along the transverse direction in\nmomentum space, consistent with superconductivity in\nthis system?\nOn the other hand, as discussed for cuprates,28\u201330\nan important identification of the mediating boson, if\nit exists, is from the fermionic spectrum which can be\nobserved by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES). Indeed, ARPES has reported the observations\nof kink feature in the electronic dispersion for the holedoped 122 system.31\u201333 However there is discrepancy in\nits vanishing temperature among the observations from\ndifferent groups. If it is unique to the SC state, i.e., vanishing above Tc , and the subtracted bosonic mode energy\ncoincides with the resonance energy, it would be a strong\nevidence for magnetic pairing mechanism.\nMotivated by these experimental facts, we perform\na detailed investigation of the spin and charge spectra\nin the normal and superconducting states, in which the\nmagnetic susceptibility and the SC gap function are determined within the self-consistent fluctuation exchange\n(FLEX) approximation using a 2-orbital model for iron\npnictides. This itinerant model calculation finds a fully\ngapped s\u00b1 -wave SC state driven by the enhanced commensurate AFM correlation. Based on a systematic\nstudy on the momentum structure of the short-range\nspin fluctuations, we find the same type of anisotropy\nas that observed in INS measurements. To understand\nthe interplay between the fluctuation anisotropy and the\ns\u00b1 superconductivity, we present a qualitative analysis\nthrough the orbital contents and the deviation from perfect nesting of the electronic structure for the 2-orbital\n\nand a more complete 5-orbital model. Meanwhile, the\ncalculated dispersion of the magnetic resonance mode exhibits an anisotropic propagating pattern. And the calculated fermionic spectral function shows the fingerprint\nof electron-mode coupling as observed in ARPES.\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe consider a Hamiltonian described by a 2-orbital\ntight-binding model and on-site multiorbital electronic\ninteractions,\nH=\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\u03b5ab\nk dka\u03c3 dkb\u03c3 + U\n\nnia\u2191 nia\u2193 + U 0\n\ni,a\n\nk,ab,\u03c3\n\n+ JH\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nnia nib\n\ni,a>b\n\nd\u2020ia\u03c3 d\u2020ib\u03c30 dia\u03c30 dib\u03c3\n\ni,a>b,\u03c3\u03c3 0\n\n+ J0\n\nX\n\nd\u2020ia\u2191 d\u2020ia\u2193 dib\u2193 dib\u2191\n\n(1)\n\ni,a6=b\n\nwhere nia\u03c3 = d\u2020ia\u03c3 dia\u03c3 is the occupation number\nof the\nP\norbital a with spin \u03c3 at site i and nia = \u03c3 nia\u03c3 with\nthe orbital index a(b) standing for the Fe orbitals dxz\nand dyz . The tight-binding description34 is given by\nyx\naa\n\u03b5xy\nk = \u03b5k = \u22124t4 sin kx sin ky and \u03b5k = \u22122t1 cos ka \u2212\n2t2 cos kb \u22124t3 cos kx cos ky \u2212\u03bc where a, b = x(y) stand for\ndxz (dyz ) orbitals and the momentum components with\na 6= b. We use the tight-binding parameters t1 = \u22120.33,\nt2 = 0.385, t3 = \u22120.234, and t4 = \u22120.26.35,36 Near\nhalf filling this tight-binding model gives rise to the FS\nthat contains two hole pockets and two electron pockets\nfor which we refer to the hole pockets around (0, 0) and\n(\u03c0, \u03c0) as \u03b11 and \u03b12 sheets, respectively, and the electron\npockets around (\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u03c0) as \u03b21 and \u03b22 sheets, respectively, in the unfolded (1 Fe per unit cell) Brillouin\nzone (BZ). As noted by Kuroki et al.37 and Kemper et\nal.14 , the appearance of a hole pocket around the (\u03c0, \u03c0)\npoint of the unfolded BZ is crucial to the formation of\nfully gapped s\u00b1 state. The predominant Fe-orbital character distribution on each FS sheet has been analyzed\nin Ref.38 . In the 5-orbital tight-binding description,14 a\nthird orbital dxy predominantly contributes to the hole\npocket at the (\u03c0, \u03c0) point and partially to the (\u03c0, 0) and\n(0, \u03c0) electronic pockets. Although the 2-orbital model\ndoes not include the third predominant orbital composition on the FS, as we will show later, the intra-orbital\nnesting configuration of it remains similar to that of the\n5-orbital description, which is believed to play an important role for the magnetic fluctuation and the superconductivity in the itinerant picture. Thus this simplified\n2-orbital description qualitatively captures the key features of the electronic structure near the Fermi energy,\nserving as a good starting point for the understanding of\nthe interplay between magnetism and superconductivity\nin the Fe-based superconductors.\nThe on-site interactions consist of the intra- and interorbital Coulomb repulsions controlled by the coupling\n\n\f3\nconstant U and U 0 , the inter-orbital Hund's rule coupling\nJH and pair hopping term J 0 . For the bare Coulomb interaction, due to rotational symmetry, the coupling constants are related by U = U 0 + 2J and J = JH = J 0 .\nHowever, as discussed in the Ref.36 , when they are parameters in an approximate theory such as FLEX which\nignores vertex corrections, they are not identical to the\nbare Coulomb matrix elements but should be considered\nas low energy coupling parameters that have been renormalized by high energy excitations. Therefore we study\ncases with various parameter values and present the typical results here.\nUsing FLEX approximation39 for the SC state40,41 ,\none self-consistently calculates the single-particle propagators renormalized by interactions due to the exchange\nof spin and charge/orbital fluctuations and the spin and\ncharge/orbital correlation renormalized by the polarization of dressed quasiparticles. In the SC state, Cooperpair condensation causes a finite anomalous self-energy,\nwhich can be treated as the SC order parameter, and\ninduces a contribution from the anomalous quasiparticle\npropagator to the fluctuations.

Further we examine the features of the magnetic response\nfor systems that develop superconductivity induced by\nexchange of short-range fluctuations. In FLEX formalism both spin and charge/orbital fluctuations contribute\nto the pairing interaction, but the major contribution to\nthe pairing glue comes from spin fluctuations for the parameter regime we are studying. The nested structure of\nthe FS leads to peak in the magnetic susceptibility near\nthe AFM wave vector QAFM = (0, \u03c0), (\u03c0, 0), which is\nstrongest at half-filling, n = 2.0 per site, indicating its\ncorrespondence to the parent compound.\nThe calculations are performed on imaginary frequency\naxis for a lattice of 64\u00d764 sites with 8192 Matsubara frequencies. When self-consistently solving the FLEX equations, the convergence of iterations is considered achieved\nwhen the maximum relative difference between two consecutive iterations of the self-energy element, \u03a3ab (k, i\u03c9n )\nor \u03a6ab (k, i\u03c9n ), is less than 10\u22126 .\nFor the current model we only find stable SC solutions in the hole doped regime, with the particle density 1.85 \u2264 n \u2264 1.90 per site, driven by short-range\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\u03c0\n\nky\n\nIn this section we investigate the momentum structure\nof the short-range magnetic fluctuations that mediate superconductivity and make connection with the magnetic\nresponse measured in INS experiments.

There is an overall sign change\nin \u2206 between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 sheets.\n\nspin fluctuations for certain range of coupling constants.\nThe achieved SC states are of s\u00b1 -wave symmetry: fully\ngapped on each FS sheet with an overall sign change between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 sheets. To illustrate the momentum\nstructure of the gap function, we show the results for\na typical set of coupling constants U = 1.5, U 0 = 1.2\nand J = J 0 = 0.8 with particle density n = 1.88 at\nT = 0.001. In this case the system exhibits a transition from the paramagnetic normal state to the SC\nstate at Tc = 0.0075 and the static spin susceptibility\n\u03c7s (q, \u03c9 = 0) shows well pronounced peaks at the commensurate wave vector QAFM = (0, \u03c0), (\u03c0, 0) both in the\nnormal and in the SC state. Note that we do not assign\nspecific units to the parameters and quantities: The coupling constants scale with the hopping parameters and\nall energies scale with the SC gap magnitude while the\ntemperatures scale with Tc . In Fig. 1 (a), we show the\nrenormalized FS configuration obtained from the intensity projection of the Cooper-pair wave function F (k, \u03c9).\nTaking the small damping parameter \u03b4 = 0.002 in the analytical continuation for the T = 0.001 solution and subtracting the gap magnitude from the spectral function\nA(\u03c9) at the Fermi wave vectors kF for each FS sheet,\nthe variation in the gap magnitude on each separated\nFS sheet is plotted in Fig. 1 (b). Clearly in this case\nthe gap is nearly isotropic on each pocket. The ratio\n2\u2206/Tc \u223c 6 \u2212 8 implies a strong coupling system.\n\n\u2022 The momentum structure of the spin excitations\nexhibits the same type of anisotropy, which, in the\nSC state, gives rise to an elliptical shape of the spin\nresonance mode. Further, the resonance mode disperses with increasing energy in the pattern broadening more rapidly along the transverse than along\nthe longitudinal direction. This anisotropic dispersion of the resonance mode associated with the intrinsic anisotropy of the mode leads to more elliptically shaped q-image.\n\u2022 The dispersion of the magnetic resonance shows\nan upward pattern with increasing energy in the\nnearly isotropic s\u00b1 state with commensurate magnetic peak. But the weight of the mode decays\ndramatically and vanishes above the particle-hole\nthreshold.\n\u2022 In the strong coupling approach, the resonance energy is affected by the SC gap magnitude and the\nmagnetic correlation strength.\nTo illustrate these points, we present the results for the\nmagnetic susceptibility \u03c7s (q, \u03c9) calculated using the typical set of parameters mentioned in the previous section followed with discussions. As Park et al.43 show\nthat the unfolded BZ description of the magnetic spectrum in the paramagnetic state is justified, our spinfluctuation spectrum calculated in the BZ with 1 Fe ion\nis discussed below. The qualitative agreement of the calculated anisotropy with that observed in INS, in turn,\nsuggests that the magnetic spectrum originates predominantly from the Fe-sublattice. In the following we refer to\nthe transverse (TR) or longitudinal (LO) direction as the\ndirection transverse or longitudinal to the corresponding\nAFM momentum transfer QAFM .\nResults\n\nTo analyze the momentum structure of the spin fluctuations, we begin with the static spin susceptibility\nRe\u03c7s (q, \u03c9 = 0).

This results in an elliptically shaped momentum structure. Our\nsystematic study shows that the degree of anisotropy increases with the deviation from the perfect nesting in\nthe electronic structure. Moreover, the calculation for\nthe temperature right above and right below the transition temperature shows that the spatial correlation does\n\nnot change through Tc , reflecting the fact that spinfluctuation induced superconductivity does not modify\nmagnetic correlation length when entering SC phase, although it is the same electrons that contribute to the\nmagnetic and SC properties. This is in agreement with\nthe INS observations.27\nThe imaginary part of the spin susceptibility\nIm\u03c7s (q, \u03c9) contains information on the magnetic excitations. As discussed for a sign-reversed SC gap structure, the most striking feature of the magnetic spectrum is the appearance of a resonance mode at the\ncharacteristic momentum transfer QAFM when entering SC phase in spite of no long-range magnetic order. This sharp mode is of spin-excitonic type in our\nmodel, originated from the Stoner enhancement factor\ni\u22121\nh\ndet 1\u0302 \u2212 \u03c7\u0302s,0 (q, i\u03bdn ) \u00dbs\n.28,29 Indeed, our calculation\nindicates a well-pronounced quasiparticle-like peak as\n\n\f6\n\n0.14\n\nTransverse dispersion\n250\n200\n\n0.1\n\n150\n\n0.08\n\n100\n\n\u03c9\n\n0.12\n\n0.06\n\n50\n\n0.04\n\n0\n\n0.02\n0\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n-50\n\nq/QAFM\n\n0.14\n\n150\n\n0.08\n\n100\n\n\u03c9\n\n200\n\n0.06\n\n50\n\n0.04\n\n0\n\n0.02\n0\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\n50\n0\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n0.02 0.04\n0.06 0.08\n0.1 0.12\n0.14\n\n\u03c9\n\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n\nq/QAFM\n\nLongitudinal dispersion\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n100\n\n250\n\n0.12\n\n0.7\n\n150\n\n(b)\n\nLongitudinal Im\u03c7s(q,\u03c9)\n\n(c)\n\n200\n\n0\n\n250\n\nIm\u03c7(q,\u03c9)\n\n0.7\n\n(a)\n\n250\n\nIm\u03c7(q,\u03c9)\n\nTransverse Im\u03c7s(q,\u03c9)\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n-50\n\nq/QAFM\n\n200\n\n0\n\n(d)\n\n0.02 0.04\n0.06 0.08\n0.1 0.12\n0.14\n\n\u03c9\n\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n\nq/QAFM\n\nFigure 5: (Color online) The anisotropic dispersive behavior of the resonance mode along the TR and LO directions with\nrespect to QAFM . (a) and (c) are the intensity plot along the TR and LO direction, respectively, while (b) and (d) show the\nweight decay of the propagating mode.\n\nNext we analyze the momentum dependence of the\nmagnetic spectrum at the resonance frequency \u03c9res . Figure 4 shows the results for Im\u03c7s (q, \u03c9res ) where a zoom-in\nq-image of the mode at (\u03c0, 0) is given in the middle. Similar to the static magnetic response, the q-shape of the\nresonance mode is also elliptical with maximal broadening along the TR direction and minimal along the LO\ndirection. This is an intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetic\nspectrum not only in the SC state but also existing in\n\nIm\u03c7s(q)\n\u03c0\n\nqy\n\nshown in Fig. 3. In this figure, the results for the spin\nsusceptibility Im\u03c7s (QAFM , \u03c9) as a function of frequency\nat the momentum transfer QAFM for temperatures T \u2248\n1.1Tc , T \u2248 0.9Tc and T \u2248 0.1Tc are presented. In the\nnormal state the magnetic spectrum exhibits a broad continuum associated with the overdamping feature of the\nspin fluctuations. The transition to SC state modifies the\nspectrum by pushing the spectral weight to higher energy\nand rapidly developing a resonance mode as the temperature decreasing. The fact that this mode is made out of\na particle-hole bound state in the excitonic form leads to\nan energy threshold taking the minimal value of sums of\ntwo gap magnitudes on any pair of FS points connected\nby the momentum transfer QAFM . Here we\n\u0001 refer to this\nthreshold as \u03a9 \u2261 mink |\u2206k | + |\u2206k+QAFM | . For the parameter set under discussion, the ratio of the resonance\nenergy to the threshold and to the SC transition temperature are roughly \u03c9res /\u03a9 \u2248 0.6 and \u03c9res /kB Tc \u2248 4, which\nagrees with the experimental values measured for K- and\nCo-doped BaFe2 As2 .19,20\n\n0\n\n0\n\nqx\n\n\u03c0\n\nFigure 6: (Color online) The dynamical spin susceptibility averaged over a \u0301 small frequency window through the resonance\n\u03c9res +\u2206\u03c9\n1\nd\u03c9Im\u03c7s (q, \u03c9) with \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9res /4 here.\nenergy: 2\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c9res \u2212\u2206\u03c9\n\nthe normal state, which has been observed in the INS\nmeasurements.25,27\nMore interestingly, the propagation of the resonance\nmode also exhibits an anisotropic behavior.

In the lower part, by translating QAFM , the \u03b21 -pocket is moved to the\nposition of the \u03b11 -pocket. For intra-orbital, but inter-band, scattering to happen, the effective scattering vertices, depicted by\nthe small dark-blue ellipses, should be able to cover the same orbital pieces on the two deviated FS sheets, i.e., the \u03b11 sheet and\nthe shifted \u03b21 sheet (dashed line). One can perform similar operation for the \u03b11 (\u03b12 ) and \u03b21 (\u03b22 ) sheets in the 2-orbital model\nand for the \u03b11 (\u03b3) and \u03b21 (\u03b22 ) sheets in the 5-orbital model. Clearly, the transversely lengthened vertices are more capable of\ninducing the intra-orbital, but inter-band, pair scattering processes.\n\ndisperses with increasing energy in an anisotropic pattern\nbroadening most rapidly along the TR rather than the\nLO direction as clearly seen in Fig. 5 (a) and (c), reminiscent of the anisotropic propagation of spin waves in the\nspin density wave state of the 122 parent compound;44\nsecond, the resonance mode disperses upwards in energy\nwith dramatically decreasing weight and vanishes above\nthe particle-hole threshold \u03a9 as shown in Fig. 5 (b) and\n(d). This upward dispersion is in contrast to the downward pattern in the d-wave cuprate.45\nThe anisotropy of the dispersion relation enhances\nthe image ellipticity of the measured magnetic response,\nif we consider a frequency average of the spectrum\nover a small window through the resonance energy, i.e.,\n \u0301 \u03c9res +\u2206\u03c9\n1\n2\u2206\u03c9 \u03c9res \u2212\u2206\u03c9 d\u03c9Im\u03c7s (q, \u03c9), mimic the observation in\nINS. This enhanced ellipticity due to the combination of\nthe intrinsic and dispersing anisotropy of the resonance\nmode is shown in Fig. 6, where we take \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9res /4.\n\nDiscussion of the spin-fluctuation anisotropy and the\ns\u00b1 superconductivity\n\nA systematic study of the 2- and a 3-orbital46 models,\nboth in hole and in electron doped regions for a variety\n\nof coupling constants, draws our attention to the connection between the momentum anisotropy of the magnetic\nfluctuations and the s\u00b1 superconductivity. Our normalstate calculations show that different anisotropic pattern\nof the fluctuations occurs at different parameter sets in\ndifferent model systems, either transversely or longitudinally lengthened. But the development of short-range\nspin fluctuations centered at QAFM does not necessarily lead to superconductivity. For the various systems\nwe have studied, the establishment of a stable s\u00b1 state\nis generally associated with the transversely lengthened\nfluctuations. This is the characteristic momentum structure of the static correlations and of the magnetic spectra\nboth in the normal and in the SC state. It poses a question: is superconductivity sensitive to the momentum\nstructure of the magnetic glue?\nHere we discuss how the specific momentum structure\nof the spin fluctuations affects the s\u00b1 superconductivity\nin the magnetic scenario where the same electrons contribute to both the magnetic and the SC properties. We\ngain the insight by recognizing the important role played\nby the orbital weight on the FS sheets. As pointed out\nby Kemper et al.,14 the dominant pairing processes involve intra-orbital scattering. The intra-orbital effective\npairing interaction vertex \u0393cc,cc\nis dominated by the proA\n\n\f8\ncesses of exchanging spin-1 fluctuations as\n3 X cc,aa aa,bb\n0\nUs\n\u03c7s\n(k \u2212 k0 , i\u03bdn ) Usbb,cc\n\u0393cc,cc\n(k,\nk\n,\ni\u03bd\n)\n\u223c\nn\nA\n2\n\n30\n\n0.1Tc\n\naa,bb\n\nk ,\u03c9n\n\nwhich scatters a pair of c-orbital electrons on \u03b1(\u03b2) sheets\nto a pair of c-orbital electrons on \u03b2(\u03b1) sheets, i.e., an\ninter-band scattering.\nA schematic demonstration of the FS configuration,\nwith predominant iron d-orbital distribution indicated,\nfor the current 2-orbital model and for a more complete\n5-orbital model are shown in Fig. 7, which were analyzed\nby Graser et al.38 and Kemper et al.14 . To illustrate the\npair scattering between two bands with the typical momentum transfer, \u03b21 pocket is translated by QAFM to\noverlap with \u03b11 pocket. As the electronic structure is\naway from perfect nesting, the intra-orbital scattering is\nmore supported by the transversely lengthened pairing\nvertices than the longitudinally lengthened ones which\nare depicted by the small dark-blue ellipses in the figure.\nOne can perform the same translation for other pairs of\npockets separated by QAFM in both models and draw the\nsame conclusion. Therefore, due to the orbital character\nof the microscopic electronic structure and the deviation\nfrom perfect nesting, this type of anisotropic momentum\nstructure of short-range spin fluctuations favor the formation of s\u00b1 SC state, since the intra-orbital pairing processes are made more plausible driven by transversely\nlengthened fluctuations.\nFactors affecting the resonance energy\n\nIn the strong coupling approach, the factors affecting\nthe resonance mode energy involve the SC gap magnitude\n|\u2206| and the magnetic correlation length \u03be.29 Our systematic study indicates that the resonance energy \u03c9res\nincreases with increasing gap magnitude but decreases\nwith increasing correlation length.\nV.\n\nFERMIONIC SPECTRUM\n\nAs discussed for cuprates,28\u201330 the impact of the mediating bosonic modes on fermions leaves fingerprint in\nthe fermionic spectrum, the SC spectral function, if the\nbosonic excitations are gapped quasiparticles such as optical phonons in the conventional superconductors. This\ngives rise to the kink feature in the electronic energy dispersion observed in ARPES measurements. The signature of electron-mode coupling is believed to be linked\n\n20\n\nA(\u03c9)\n\nwhere a, b, c are orbital indices and \u0393cc,cc\nbecomes sigA\nnificant when the momentum transfer k \u2212 k0 \u223c QAFM .\nIt gives rise to the intra-orbital Cooper-pair formation\nthrough\nT X cc,cc\n\u03a6cc (k, i\u03c9n ) =\n\u0393\n(k, k0 , i\u03c9n \u2212 i\u03c9n0 )F cc (k0 , i\u03c9n0 )\nN 0 0 A\n\n1.1Tc\n\n25\n\n15\n\ndip\n\n10\n5\n0\n-0.2\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n\u03c9\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nFigure 8: (Color online) The fermionic spectral function A(\u03c9)\nat a k-point on the \u03b11 sheet in the SC (T \u2248 0.1Tc ) state (red\nsolid line) as well as in the normal (T \u2248 1.1Tc ) state (green\ndashed line). Notice the peak-dip-hump feature in the negative frequency regime when the system becomes superconducting. Comparing the SC state data with the normal state\ndata, we see that the spectral weight is conserved.\n\nto the pairing. If short-range spin fluctuations mediate Cooper pairs, with the emergence of the gapped\nquasiparticle-like spin resonance mode in the superconducting state, large fermionic decay occurs by exchange\nof the magnetic resonance mode in scattering processes.\nThis leaves a dip in the electronic spectral function at the\nenergy \u03c9dip = |\u2206k+QAFM | + \u03c9res where |\u2206k+QAFM | indicates the SC gap magnitude at the Fermi point connected\nby the AFM wave vector. Indeed, our calculation does\nshow the dip feature in the electronic spectral function.\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the spectral function at a k-point on\nthe \u03b11 sheet exhibits the characteristic peak-dip-hump\nbehavior in Ak (\u03c9) with the dip position \u03c9dip \u2248 0.05 to\nbe the sum of the resonance energy \u03c9res \u2248 0.03 and the\ngap magnitude |\u2206k+QAFM | \u2248 0.02 at the point on the\nother band connected by QAFM . The normal state data\nat the same k-point is also plotted in Fig. 8 to show the\nconservation of spectral weight.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we have investigated the momentum\nstructure of the short-range magnetic fluctuations that\ndrive the nearly isotropic s\u00b1 superconductivity using a\nmicroscopic model for the Fe-based superconductors in\nthe self-consistent fluctuation exchange approximation.\nThe calculated magnetic response exhibits an anisotropic\nfeature with largest momentum span along the direction\ntransverse to the momentum transfer QAFM , which gives\nrise to an elliptical image of the magnetic excitation. The\ncalculated momentum anisotropy of the magnetic spectrum agrees with the INS measurements. An analysis on\nthe orbital character of the electronic structure associated with the deviation from perfect nesting shows that\n\n\f9\nthe transversely lengthened short-range spin fluctuations\nenhance intra-orbital, but inter-band, pair scattering processes that play an important role to the formation of s\u00b1 wave superconductivity in this system. Therefore, this\nanisotropic momentum structure of the magnetic fluctuations favors the development of the SC phase in the\nmagnetic scenario for the iron-based superconductors.\nOur detailed study on the resonance mode in the magnetic spectrum shows that the dispersion of the mode\nis also anisotropic with larger broadening along the\ntransverse than the longitudinal direction. Meanwhile,\nthe mode propagates upwards with increasing energy in\nthe case of nearly isotropic s\u00b1 -state and commensurate\nspin susceptibility, but vanishes above the particle-hole\nthreshold.\nAs the feedback from the spin excitations on fermions,\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n21\n22\n\nY.
