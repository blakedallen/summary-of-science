We do\nbelieve that most of the interesting physics associated to them can be captured by simple models described through Hamiltonians\ninvolving interactions among only few of their constituents. However, even for such simple models, we are not capable of\nderiving their properties, as we still miss computational tools that are generically applicable.\nIn few fortunate cases, the models constructed are exactly solvable, and almost all physical quantities can be computed exactly.\nWhen this is not the case, one needs to appeal to numerical simulations. A major obstacle to this approach is provided by the\nfact that the complexity of simulations increases exponentially with the number of the QMBS constituents. This means that,\ntypically, one can only deal exactly with few (say up to forty) constituents.\nSome larger QMBS can still be simulated approximately. This occurs, for instance, in weakly interacting systems, where\nperturbation theory (spin-wave and its modifications), mean-field approaches and density functional theory are particularly\nsuccessful. In all these cases, indeed, there is a small parameter \u2013 namely the interaction among constituents\u2013 that can at the\nbeginning be neglected and then systematically included in the model [1, 2].\nThe strongly interacting regime of QMBS is much more complex to address for the lack of such small parameter. However,\nthe equilibrium properties of bosonic non-frustrated systems can be extracted using Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) techniques\n[3, 4]. Frustrated and/or fermionic systems are more difficult to study, but great effort has also been dedicated to them. At\npresent, however, different methods often provide different results so that physical properties of these models are in most cases\na subject of controversy (see i.e. [3] vs. [5]).\nFor weakly entangled states, tensor networks algorithms (TN) are emerging as an alternative to other techniques such as QMC,\nand in some cases can also be merged with the latter to provide new numerical tools [6\u201310]. TN aim at providing a variational\nansatz to describe low-energy states of QMBS, with resources that scale at most polynomially with the number of constituents.\nThese techniques also give access to short-time dynamics of QMBS [11, 12], but for the moment still fail in describing their\nlong-time, out of equilibrium, dynamics.\nIn this situation, analog quantum simulations (AQS) appear as an alternative tool to study QMBS [13, 14]. These are experimental setups with quantum constituents (photons, ions, atoms) that are used to encode the desired QMBS [15]. State of the art\ncontrol of these quantum systems allows also to artificially induce the desired many-body Hamiltonian acting on the constituents.\nGauge theories are special types of QMBS, where states of the system are forced to obey local symmetry constraints. They\nstand at the core of our understanding of known fundamental interactions (electro-weak, strong, and, in a broader sense, gravitational). They are also candidates to describe the low-energy physics of frustrated antiferromagnets [16, 17]. As for other QMBS,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: luca.tagliacozzo@icfo.es\naddress: alessio.celi@icfo.es\n\n\f2\ntheir strong coupling regime is not completely understood: in particular, they present puzzling phases, such as, confined phases\nand topological phases, which escape the standard Landau paradigm of phase classification.\nFor gauge theories, and their version defined on (spatial) lattices (LGT), in the absence of fermions \u2013 or when the number of\nfermions is such that there is no sign problem\u2013 one can perform Monte-Carlo simulations. Recently, ideas about how to perform\ntensor network simulations of such theories, have been push forward as well [18].\nApplying AQS to study gauge theories is particularly challenging since, in general, their dynamics involve Hamiltonian with\ncouplings among more than the nearest-neighbors, and more than just two-body terms. This is the reason why, at present, the\ncommunity has mainly focused on simulating the effects of static non-trivial background gauge fields on the phases of the matter.\nIn this limit, the many-body interactions can be neglected, and the effect of the gauge field reduces to a specific modifications of\nthe kinetic term of the matter field \u2013 hopping in the lattice\u2013 that only involves two-body interactions.\nIn this context, most of the studies deal with ultracold atoms [15], and some of the theoretical proposals have been already\nrealized in the experiments on the lattice [19], or, off the lattice [20, 21]. In optical lattice simulations, one can tailor the hopping\nphase/matrices properly, mainly by optical means (but also by lattice time-modulation or rotation [22, 23]). The interest in\nsuch studies ranges from Quantum Hall physics, where strong magnetic fluxes \u2013 very hard to obtain in condensed matter with\nreal magnetic field\u2013 are needed [24, 25], to the simulation of relativistic matter and topological insulators, or extra-dimensions\n[26, 27].\nA natural step further towards the full simulation of gauge theories with AQS, is to include the dynamics of the gauge fields.\nSuch aim, for instance in two dimensions, requires the engineering of at least three-body couplings in triangular lattices and\nfour-body couplings in the more common square lattices. These kind of interactions are very difficult to induce in AQS, such as,\nultracold optical lattices [28]). There have already been some proposals to overcome these difficulties for Abelian gauge fields\nusing molecular states [29], and, more recently, BECs and single atoms with internal states in [30] and [31], respectively.\nHere, we pursue an alternative solution. We propose to simulate the dynamics of gauge fields by implementing digital quantum\nsimulations with Rydberg atoms (DQRS). Rydberg atoms are neutral atoms that can be excited to states close to the continuum\nspectrum, having very strong dipolar moments. Such dipoles induce long-range interactions that make possible the simultaneous\ninteraction of several atoms together. The basic ideas for DQRS are described in [32] and involve the presence of ancilla atoms,\napart from the ones entering the Hamiltonian of the system to be simulated. These are called \"control\" Rydberg atoms. The\nother atoms, whose interaction should encode the Hamiltonian to be simulated, are generally called \"ensemble\" Rydberg atoms.\nThey have to be physically arranged following the pattern of the many-body interactions appearing in the desired Hamiltonian.\nFor example, if one is trying to encode four-body interaction of the four atoms around an elementary plaquette of a square lattice,\nsuch atoms should be inside the blockade radius of a given control atom, whose dipole moment is used to implement the wanted\nplaquette interaction among them.\nOne can carry out simultaneous operations on all the atoms inside the blockade radius of a control atom, operations determined\nby the state of the control atom itself. This can be achieved through a laser setup involving two- and three-photons transitions.\nIn particular, one can engineer 2D lattices where the ensemble atoms are arranged on the links, while the control atoms are at\neach site and at the center of each plaquette; at same time, one can tune the lattice spacing so that all the links belonging to a\nplaquette and entering a site are simultaneously contained inside the blockade radius of the respective plaquette and site control\nqubits. With this geometry one can perform LGT simulations [33].\nIn this setup, one can perform arbitrary time-evolution with the desired (Abelian) LGT Hamiltonian, and, in some simple\ncases, one can also accomplish dissipative quantum simulations to prepare a desired state. This is, for instance, the technique\nproposed for the preparation of the ground-state of the Toric Code in [33], whose low-energy physics, in the appropriate limit,\ncan be mapped to the Z2 LGT.\nIn this paper, we provide a specific proposal to perform a DQRS of a U(1) LGT in two dimensions. An important ingredient\nof the proposal is the choice of a specific U(1) LGT where the constituents are qubits. Such qubits can be represented in terms\nof atoms with two logical level states, such as the ones available in standard Rydberg setups. The corresponding formulation of\nU(1) LGT is also known as link model or gauge magnet [34\u201337].\nThe outcomes of our proposal are multifold. First, the alternative formulation that we consider is not only more practical\nto be implemented \u2013 the local Hilbert space is finite\u2013 but also \u2013 at least it is our belief\u2013 closer to the language of the QMBS\ncommunity than the original Hamiltonian formalism proposed by Kogut and Susskind [45]. Within this general framework, we\nshow how to derive the specific U(1) gauge magnet we are interested in.\nFurthemore, we introduce an exactly solvable version of gauge magnet, where we are able to provide the exact ground-state\nwave function. We use this example to illustrate two paradigmatic properties of gauge theories, i.e., the absence of spontaneous\nbreaking of the gauge symmetry, and the presence of charge confinement. The quantitative check that such properties hold can\nbe used by experimentalists as a sine qua non test of the quality of the simulator.\nFinally, we determine a specific protocol to prepare the ground-state of the model and perform arbitrary, out of equilibrium,\ndynamical simulations. As well known, one can extract the excitation spectrum of the model by performing these simulations.\nOur approach is relevant because it allows the simulation of a LGT with continuous symmetry groups away from the special\npoints, as studied in [33]. It provides a generalization of the techniques described in [38\u201340], such to permit to prepare groundstates of Hamiltonians that are not frustration-free. Furthermore, we explain how to perform out of equilibrium long-time-\n\n\f3\nevolution of the U(1) gauge magnet with a DQRS, following the prescription of [33].\nIt is worth to notice that our ground-state preparation scheme successfully merges several available techniques. It is, indeed,\nmade of two steps. First, by taking advantage of the fact that the square lattice is bipartite, we decompose the Hamiltonian of\nthe gauge magnet as the sum of two Hamiltonians, each of them for separated is frustration-free. This allows us to prepare the\nground-state any of the two with standard dissipative protocols. The second step involves a driven evolution via DQRS to the\nfinal Hamiltonian of gauge magnets. The turning on of the part of the Hamiltonian that has been neglected in the first instance,\ncan be adiabatic or not. Indeed, the efficency of the ground-state driving can be improved by following the chopped random\nbasis (CRAB) protocol [41, 42], which allows for closed-loop optimization experiment, i.e., the preparation time is optimized\nrecursively by running the DQRS. In this way, we manage to prepare the ground-state of the complete Hamiltonian, a very\ncomplex, strongly interacting, non frustration-free, i.e., frustrated Hamiltonian. In practise, such preparation can be applied to\nany system governed by a local Hamiltonian in bipartite lattices.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II, we introduce the concepts necessary to formulate a LGT. In doing so, we\nassume that the reader is familiar with many-body quantum systems, while the knowledge of continuous or Lagrangian formulation of gauge theory is not assumed. In particular, we perform a constructive derivation of the Hilbert space and Hamiltonian of\nan arbitrary Abelian LGT (this section is complemented by the examples contained in the Appendix). In section II B, we review\nthe properties of the U(1) gauge magnets as a specific instance of generic Abelian LGT using the language and the notation\nintroduced in the previous section. We discuss how to split the Hamiltonian in the sum of two frustration-free Hamiltonians.\nThis is a crucial step both for applying the QDRS protocol of the ground-state preparation, and for analyzing the absence of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and the presence of charge confinement. We propose these phenomena as key experimental\nobservables to probe whether the simulator is working properly. In section III, we start by reviewing the ideas beyond digital\nquantum simulation and the mesoscopic Rydberg gate [32]. We discuss in detail the setup necessary to perform a DQRS of the\nU(1) gauge magnet time-evolution, which permits the study of long-time, out of equilibrium, dynamics. We conclude by giving\nspecial emphasis on how to prepare the ground-state of the U(1) gauge magnet with a mixture of dissipative and adiabatic evolution and discuss the relation between our model and standard compact U(1) LGT. We propose two possible sets of measurements\nthat can be used by the experimentalists to check both absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and charge confinement. For\nreader's convenience, the main features of the experimental set-up and the experimental sequence are summarized in section\nIII F.\nII.\n\nCONSTRUCTING AN ABELIAN LATTICE GAUGE THEORY\n\nWe introduce an Hamiltonian formulation of Abelian lattice gauge theories. Gauge theories are generally studied in the\nLagrangian formulation, by introducing an action invariant under local transformations, and quantizing it via the path integral\nformulation of Quantum Mechanics [43, 44]. By discretizing the space-time, one obtains a lattice description that can be treated\nwith the tools of statistical field theories. In this formulation, the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian can be derived from the\ntransfer matrix of the model, as as originally proposed by Kogut and Susskind [45] (in the same way one can map the classical\n2D Ising model at finite temperature on to the quantum Ising chain at the zero temperature with a transverse field [46]).\nHere, we take an alternative route. Indeed, an Abelian lattice gauge theory is a particular case of a many-body quantum system,\nwhere the constituents are arranged on a lattice and the states (and the observables) are invariant (as we will explain below) under\nlocal transformations, which are elements of a given Abelian group G. Starting by this operative definition, we can construct an\nHamiltonian for a LGT. It is worth to notice that, for a given G, infinitely many gauge invariant theories \u2013 and Hamiltonian\u2013 can\nbe defined, although many of them may be equivalent under renormalization group flow, i.e., may share the same fixed point and\ncritical properties. Baring this consideration in mind, the basics steps to follow to construct a gauge invariant Hamiltonian for\na lattice system, are: i) the choice of the gauge group G that, as we will see, has immediate consequences on the definition of\nthe Hilbert space of the model; ii) the definition of the operators defining the gauge transformations; and iii) the determination\nof the set of operators that can be used to build the Hamiltonian, which has to be invariant under gauge transformation. This\nconstructive approach should sound more familiar to people working in the field of quantum many-body systems and condensed\nmatter rather than the one originally proposed by Kogut and Susskind, as it is not requiring a prior knowledge of gauge theories.\nIt also makes explicit that each of the points i)-iii) entails a large freedom. The original Kogut-Susskind proposal reveals itself\nas a specific choice of LGT. Also, using this approach one can interpret different LGT known in the literature as link models\nor gauge magnets [34\u201337] as a truncated version of the original Kogut-Susskind proposal. We would like to mention that this\napproach is rooted in the celebrated works by Kitaev about the Toric Code and Quantum Doubles [47] that we follow closely.\nWhen defining the steps i)-iii) we will explicitly construct the simplest Z2 LGT, so that the reader will have an immediate\nexample on which she/he can understand the more general abstract formulation.

In order to construct a LGT one first need to specify the symmetry group G. For example, the simplest\nchoice is to consider G = Z2 , which is the group formed by two elements, 1, e, with the following multiplication table 1 \u00d7 e =\ne \u00d7 1 = e, e \u00d7 e = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1.\nThe constituents of the LGT are attached to the links l connecting sites s of an oriented lattice L . The fact that the lattice is\noriented means that, when addressing a link, one has not only to specify its position but also its orientation (the direction to follow\nin order to walk along it, i.e., in 2D either from left to right or from up to down or viceversa). The need for considering oriented\nlattices can be understood through the physical picture of the links as currents moving from a site to another, the orientation is\nthe direction of the current (and the gauge condition is the analogue of the conservation of the current at each site).\nEach of the constituents attached to the oriented links is described by a vector in a local Hilbert space Vl . If the lattice has N\nlinks, the global Hilbert space is defined as the tensor product H = Vl \u2297N .\nThe choice of Vl is not unique, and this is the first freedom at hand in the construction of LGT. In particular, the original\nformulation by Kogut and Susskind uses as local Hilbert space the group algebra C(G), so that the space of constituents is the\nvector space generated by linear combinations of elements of G with complex coefficients. To each element of the group G,\none associates a vector |gi, with the property hh|gi = \u03b4g,h . Here \u03b4.,. is the Kronecker delta. In the simplest case of Z2 , the\nlocal Hilbert space is generated by the two orthogonal vectors |1i and |ei, and it is isomorphic to C2 . In the Kogut-Susskind\nformulation, the dimension of the local Hilbert space is strictly related to the number of elements in the group. Hence, it becomes\ninfinite for continuous groups like U(1). However, as we will show below, it is perfectly consistent to consider a local Hilbert\nspace whose dimension does not depend on the number of elements G.\nAs an example, the space of constituents of a 2D lattice is sketched in Fig. 1. Since we are dealing with an oriented lattice,\nwe also orient the states. Following physical intuition of a links as currents between sites, the change of orientation corresponds\nto an inversion of the currents. With the standard choice of the local Hilbert space as group algebra, Vl = C(G), the physical\nintuition translates in associating the inverse in G to a flip of the orientation. This can always done since the states are elements\nof a group that by definition have their own inverse. Hence, changing the orientation of a link is equivalent to the operation\n|hil \u2192 |h\u22121 i\u2212l .\n\n(1)\n\nThe detailed graphical explanation of the role of the orientation is given in the Appendix B, Fig. 11 iv). It is worth to observe that,\nfor the guiding example of G = Z2 , the orientation plays no role since e\u22121 = e and 1\u22121 = 1, hence, |eil = |ei\u2212l and |1il = |1i\u2212l .\nThe only requirement on the local Hilbert space, Vl , needed to construct a consistent LGT, is that Vl has to be isomorphic to a\nrepresentation of the symmetry group G. In particular, the choice of C(G) induces the choice of the fundamental representation\nof the group, R f (G). The action of an element of X(g) \u2208 R f (G) on |hi, is defined as\nX(g)|hi = |(gh)i,\n\n(2)\n\nThis means that the matrix representation of X(g) reads\nX(g) =\n\n\u2211 |ghihh|.\nh\u2208G\n\n(3)\n\n\f5\nFor G = Z2 , it follows that X(1) = |1ih1| + |eihe| and X(e) = |eih1| + |1ihe|, which coincide with the identity matrix and the \u03c3 x\nPauli matrix, respectively.\nWhen we change the orientation of a link, accordingly to (1), we also have to invert the operator that is acting on it,\n|(gh)il \u2192 |(h\u22121 g\u22121 )i\u2212l = X\u2212l (h\u22121 g\u22121 h)|h\u22121 i\u2212l = X\u2212l (g)\u2020 |h\u22121 i\u2212l\n\n(4)\n\nwhere l is an arbitrary oriented link of L and we have used the fact that, for Abelian groups, h\u22121 g\u22121 h = g\u22121 , and, for unitary\nrepresentations, X(g\u22121 ) = X(g)\u2020 . The irrelevance of the orientation in the Z2 case translates in that both X(1) and X(e) are\nHermitian.\nii) Gauge invariance and the physical Hilbert space. A generic gauge transformation is defined by choosing a group element\nfor each site of the lattice and rotating all the links entering that particular site with the matrices representing the rotation for\nthat particular element. The building blocks of gauge transformations are thus obtained by acting on all links entering a given\nsite with X(g). The operator that induces such rotation is often referred as star operator and for the specific case of a 2D square\nlattice is defined as\nAs (g) \u2261\n\nO\n\nXl (g) : |hl1 , hl2 , hl3 , hl4 i \u2192 |ghl1 , ghl2 , ghl3 , ghl4 i,\n\n(5)\n\nl\u2208{li }s\n\nwhere s is a generic site of the lattice and {li }, i = 1, . . . , 4, is the set of all the links entering s, as depicted on Fig. 1 b). In view\nof (1) and (4), this operator acting on the links of a lattice oriented in the conventional way (such as in Fig. 1a) becomes\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\nAs (g) : |h\u2212l1 , h\u2212l2 , hl3 , hl4 i \u2192 |h\u22121\nl1 g , hl2 g , ghl3 , ghl4 i,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the links are numbered clockwise starting by the one on the top. In terms of X(g) operators, the above expression is\nequivalent to As (g) = Xl\u20201 (g)Xl\u20202 (g)Xl3 (g)Xl4 (g). The choice of the group element g can vary from site to site so it would be more\nappropriate to use gs but in order to simplify the notation we stick to g. For G = Z2 , the only non-trivial As operators are those\nassociated with the group element e and are defined as As (e) = \u03c3lx1 \u03c3lx2 \u03c3lx3 \u03c3lx4 . The action of As (e) then induces spin-flips on all\nqubits entering the specific link s.\nStates are invariant under the gauge transformations at site s if they are eigenvectors of the As (g) operators with eigenvalue\n+1,\nAs (g)|\u03c8i = |\u03c8i, \u2200g \u2208 G.\n\n(7)\n\nSince generic gauge transformations are product of local ones, a state is gauge invariant if\nT ({g})|\u03c8i \u2261\n\nO\n\nAs (g)|\u03c8i = |\u03c8i, \u2200g \u2208 G.\n\n(8)\n\ns\u2208L\n\nThis leads to the definition of the physical Hilbert space, HG , as the set of those states in H that are gauge invariant,\nHG = {|\u03c8i} s.t. T ({g})|\u03c8i = |\u03c8i, \u2200g \u2208 G.\n\n(9)\n\nIt is important to notice that the physical Hilbert space is a subspace of the original Hilbert space,\nHG \u2208 H \u2261 V \u2297N ' C |G|\u2297N ,\n\n(10)\n\nFor G = Z2 , the requirement of invariance at a specific site under the action of As (e) reduces the dimension of the Hilbert space\nfrom 16 to 8. In order to determine the allowed states, it is better to diagonalize \u03c3 x , \u03c3 x = |+ih+| \u2212 |\u2212ih\u2212|. In this basis, all those\nstates formed as tensor product of four eigenstates of \u03c3 x with an even number of |\u2212i are eigenstates of As (e) with eigenvalue\n+1, and thus gauge-invariant. As we will describe in the following, one can give a nice geometrical interpretation to those states\nin terms of closed string of |\u2212i.\niii) Operators compatible with the requirement of gauge invariance. Once defined the physical Hilbert space, we focus on the\noperators that are compatible with the requirement of gauge invariance. By definition, the LGT Hamiltonian H has to respect\nthe local symmetry, i.e., commute with all star operators As (gs ),\n[H, As ] = 0, \u2200As .\n\n(11)\n\nOur goal is to built up H as a sum of local terms.\nTo this aim, we introduce a set of operators Z(r), acting on the tensor product of Vl \u2297 Vg . Again, there is a lot of freedom\nin defining the factor Vg , since the only requirement is to support an irreducible representation (irrep) of the gauge group (for\n\n\f6\na definition of irreducible representation refer to [48]). When the local Hilbert space is the group algebra, the operators Z(r)\nacquire the following form\nZ(r) =\n\n\u2211 Rr (h) \u2297 |hihh|,\n\n(12)\n\nh\u2208G\n\nwhere Rr (h) is the matrix representing h in the irreducible representation r of G. Since all irreducible representation of Abelian\ngroups are one dimensional and isomorphic, for Abelian theories we can drop the index r from Rr and think of them as acting\nonly on Vl since, in this case, R(h) is just a phase. For example, in the case of G = Z2 , the only non-trivial choice for Z is\nZ = \u03c3 z = |1ih1| \u2212 |eihe|.\nThe relation between Z and X(g) is encoded in the commutation relation\nZX(g)|hi = R(gh)|ghi = R(g)XZ|hi\n\n(13)\n\nThis immediately suggests a minimal choice to fulfill (11). We can, indeed, consider as building blocks for H the product of\nfour Z operators acting on links around elementary plaquettes of the lattice\nBp \u2261\n\nO\n\nZl (r),\n\n(14)\n\nl\u2208{li } p\n\nthat we generally call plaquette operator. Here, {li } p , i = 1, . . . , 4, is a set of links belonging to the plaquette p and anti-clockwise\noriented starting from bottom, as sketched in Fig. 1c. By rewriting B p for the standard-oriented lattice, as in Fig. 1a, we obtain\nB p = Zl1 (r)Zl2 (r)Z(r)\u2020l3 Z(r)\u2020l4 .\n\n(15)\n\nIn the elementary case of G = Z2 , the plaquette operator is just B p = \u03c3lz1 \u03c3lz2 \u03c3lz3 \u03c3lz4 .\nAs a plaquette and a star operator share none or two links, l and l 0 , it is sufficient to verify the relation\n[Zl (r) \u2297 Zl 0 (r), Xl (g) \u2297 Xl\u20200 (g)] = 0,\n\n(16)\n\nin order to check that B p and As commute. As the above relation is a direct consequence of (13) (and that for any representation\nR(g\u22121 ) = R\u22121 (g)), the desired result\n[B p , As (g)] = 0,\n\n\u2200{p, s} \u2208 L , g \u2208 G,\n\n(17)\n\nholds.\nAs obvious for an Abelian gauge group \u2013 the case of interest in this work\u2013 any operator Xl (h) commutes with As (gs ). Hence,\nit follows that any hermitian functional of B p and Xl (h) is a good gauge invariant Hamiltonian for Abelian gauge theories. In\nparticular, we focus on the linear combination\nH(\u03b8 ) = \u2212 cos \u03b8 \u2211 B p + sin \u03b8 \u2211 Xl (g) + H.c. ,\np\n\n(18)\n\nl\n\nwhere p are the elementary plaquettes of the lattice and l are the links. This coincides with the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians\n[45]. In the specific case of G = Z2 , it can be written explicitly in terms of Pauli matrices H(\u03b8 ) = \u2212 cos \u03b8 \u2211 p \u220fl\u2208p \u03c3lz +\nsin \u03b8 \u2211l \u03c3lx (g).\nOn physical ground, the B p and Xl operators describe magnetic and electric interactions, respectively. For the specific example\nof G = Z2 , both electric and magnetic fluxes can only have two values, \u00b11.\nIt is worth noticing that the presence in the Hamiltonian of terms involving four-body interactions is a direct consequence of\ngauge invariance. There have been several attempts to obtain a gauge invariant Hamiltonian starting from a model with only\nfirst neighbour interactions. For instance, by defining two-body Hamiltonians on a coarse grained lattice [49], one can obtain\nin some case equivalent Hamiltonians to those with four-body interactions. However, at the moment these type of constructions\nare restricted to exactly solvable models, and it is unclear how to generalize them to a generic Hamiltonian, as the one we will\nconsider in the following. Thus, in this paper we stick to the idea that gauge invariance (on square lattices) requires four-body\ninteractions.\nB.\n\nGauge magnets or link models\n\nUp to this point, we have seen the general requirements for obtaining a LGT. That is to say, a LGT is characterized by i) the\npresence of a gauge symmetry that permits to ii) identify a subspace of the full Hilbert space as the physical Hilbert space where\n\n\f7\niii) only gauge invariant operators can be considered. In order to get the original Kogut-Susskind proposal, we need to make\nspecific choices for all the three points. Indeed, for i) we use as a local Hilbert space the group algebra C(G). This immediately\nimplies that in ii) the X(g) operators are obtained by considering the regular representation of the rotation by an element g of\ngroup G. Furthermore, in iii) we have constructed the Hamiltonian using the simplest closed path of the lattice, the plaquettes.\nNevertheless, any of the above choices may be changed, resulting in a different gauge theory. Here, we focus on alternative\nchoices to i). The reason is that the C(G) algebra for a continuous group is infinite dimensional, while the implementation we\nhave in mind of LGT simulator with optical lattices can only deal with finite dimensional local Hilbert spaces (see section III).\nOur aim is to construct an Abelian LGT with the smallest possible local Hilbert space, independently on the number of\nelements of the group G. This leads to LGT that have been called gauge magnets or link models [34\u201337] in the literature, whose\nparticular case is that U(1) LGT with finite dimensional local Hilbert space.\nLet us start by comparing those LGT to the formulation of Kogut-Susskind. In order to do so, let us consider again the\n(possibly infinite dimensional) local Hilbert space C(G). A celebrated theorem of group theory [48], allows us to truncate C(G)\nto a finite dimensional Hilbert space, without destroying the gauge symmetric structure. The theorem states that the regular\nrepresentation (the one that acts on C(G)) can be written as the direct sum of all possible irreducible representations (with a\nmultiplicity equal to their dimensionality).\nAs a consequence of this theorem, we are guaranteed that there is a change of basis such that the operators X(g) become block\ndiagonal,\nX(g) = \u2295r \u2211 Rr (g)i, j |(r, i)ih(r, j)|,\n\n(19)\n\nij\n\nwhere we have explicitly written the block structure of X(g) labeled by the r irrep, and the Rr (g)i, j are matrix elements of the\nirrep r of g \u2208 G, i, j = 1 * * * dim(r). We call the rotation matrix that brings all X(g) to the block diagonal \u03b1((r, i), g), so that we\ncan express the Z(r) operators in the new basis as\nZ(r) =\n\nz(r)(pi),(q j) |(p, i)ih(q, j)|.\n\n\u2211\n\n(20)\n\n(p,i),(q, j)\n\nwhere the matrix z(r)(pi),(q j) is z(r)(pi),(q j) = \u2211g \u03b1((p, i), g)Rr (g)\u03b1 \u22121 (g, (q, j)). We call the new basis with abuse of notation\n{|ri} basis.\nIn the {|ri} basis, we can safely truncate the local Hilbert space of the LGT without any effect on the symmetry requirements.\nIndeed, we just have to include at least one of the diagonal blocks of X(g). However, it could happen that by keeping just one\nblock either X(g) or Z(r) become trivial (that is indeed the case for Abelian theories). For this reason, we need to keep at least\ntwo irreps. In this case, the local Hilbert space will have dimension d = dim(r1 ) + * * * dim(rn ), where one can stop at the first n\nthat provides both non-trivial symmetry requirement, and non-trivial dynamics.\nIn the following, we will provide the specific example of the U(1) gauge magnets, since it is the one we are interested in\nsimulating with optical lattices. In the Appendices, we provide further examples for generic ZN gauge magnets.\nC.\n\nU(1) Gauge magnet\n\nUsing the ideas of the previous section, we can easily study the U(1) gauge magnet. A gauge magnet differs from the standard\nLGT by the choice of the local Hilbert space. Rather than using the group algebra, one retains at least two arbitrary irreps,\nr1 \u2295 r2 . Since U(1) is Abelian, its irreps are one-dimensional: it means that we can work with qubits. We could choose any\nirreps r1 and r2 , the simplest choice is to select the trivial irrep where all the element are mapped to 1, and the irrep where a\ngiven element g \u2208U(1), distinct than the identity 1, is mapped to the phase ei\u03b1g . As we are interested in faithful irreps, \u03b1g has to\n\u03b1\nbe chosen not commensurable with 2\u03c0, i.e, \u03c0g \u2208\n/ {Rationals}, if g is s.t. gn 6= 1, \u2200n \u2208 N. Note that asking local invariant under\na g as such it is sufficient to ensure invariance under any local U(1)-transformation. We denote the eigenvectors of the X(g)s as\n|+i and |\u2212i. This means that the X operators are\nX(g) = |+ih+| + |\u2212ih\u2212|ei\u03b1g ,\n\n(21)\n\nZ = |+ih\u2212|.\n\n(22)\n\nwhile the Z operator reads\n\nThis specific model can be mapped (on bipartite lattices) by a unitary transformation to the one studied in [50].\nIn order to describe the physics of the model, it is important to notice that we can characterize HG graphically. In the |+i and\n|\u2212i basis and with the standard 2D orientation of Fig. 1, the gauge condition (7) on a given site s selects among the 24 states of\nthe four links entering s only six possible configurations\n|+, +, +, +i, |\u2212, +, \u2212, +i, |+, \u2212, +, \u2212i, |\u2212, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212i, |\u2212, +, +, \u2212i, |+, \u2212, \u2212, +i.\n\n(23)\n\n\f8\nThese are shown in Fig. 2. Similarly to standard LGT, we can interpret the U(1)-invariant Hilbert space as the space of closed\nstrings formed by |\u2212i states, onto the vacuum of |+i states. Indeed, as any of the six allowed states contains an even number of\n|\u2212i, at each site of the lattice, for any ingoing |\u2212i there is also the corresponding outgoing one. Hence, the string cannot end\non a (bulk) site, i.e. only closed string (or string touching the boundary) are compatible with gauge invariance. In addition, it is\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nFigure 2: a) The requirement of gauge invariance of the states using (7) selects only 6 out of the total 16 states of the four qubits entering a\ngiven site. In the standard 2D orientation, one can visualize the 6 allowed states by coloring in red states |+i and blue |\u2212i. b) If we consider\nthe standard Z2 LGT the gauge symmetry condition of (7) selects 8 out of the 16 states of the four qubits attached to the links entering a given\nsite. They include the same 6 states than those of the U(1) gauge magnet of panel a). The two extra states are represented here, and are those\nresponsible of the existence short closed loops.\n\nworth to notice that the six allowed configurations do not allow to construct a closed string of finite size (without reaching the\nboundary). This means that, for lattices with periodic boundary conditions, strings can only close by wrapping around the whole\nlattice. This implies that their length is at least equal to the lattice size. This is an important difference with respect to standard\nLGT. In standard LGT, indeed, closed strings can be of arbitrary length, the shortest being the strings around a single plaquette.\nIn order to clarify the origin of this discrepancy, one can consider the Kogut-Susskind Z2 LGT introduced in the previous\nsection. There, the group algebra is two-dimensional, that is, the local Hilbert space is still made of qubits. As we have already\nshown, the gauge condition selects 8 out of the 16 states of the four links entering a given site. It turns out that 6 of them coincide\nwith the one of the U(1) gauge magnet of Fig. 2 a), but there are two extra states\n|\u2212, \u2212, +, +i, |+, +, \u2212, \u2212i,\n\n(24)\n\nas shown in Fig. 2 b).\nThese states are, indeed, the ones needed to close a small loop of |\u2212i (for example a single plaquette). In fact, this small\ndifference produces completely different strings patterns, as we can appreciate in Fig. 3.\nThe different string pattern have deep consequences on the physics of the models. Standard LGT, indeed, have at least two\nphases, a confined phase and a deconfined phase. In the confined phase, short closed string abound, while long closed string are\nvery rare and vice-versa in the deconfined phase [51]. In the U(1) gauge magnet, by just noticing the absence of short closed\nstrings, we already have a strong indication that the phase diagram of the model is very different from the one of the standard\nU(1) LGT.\nLet us analyze it in details. First, let us consider the dynamics induced by the Hamiltonian (18) when \u03b8 = 0. Contrary to\nwhat happens in standard Abelian LGT, for the gauge magnets two plaquettes operator sharing one link are not commuting, i.e.,\ngenerally [B p , B0p ] 6= 0, . This means that the ground-state is not simultaneous eigenvector of all the B p 's. However, for the sake\nof the present discussion we can, as suggested in [50], circumvent this problem on bipartite lattices by considering, first, only\nhalf of Hamiltonian, and, afterwards, the effects of the other terms in (18). We start with\nH0 = \u2212 \u2211(B py + B\u2020py ),\n\n(25)\n\npy\n\nwhere with py we label half of the plaquettes, the ones drawn in yellow in Fig. 4. In this way, H0 only contains operators that do\nnot share any link, and, thus, all commuting.\nThe model (25) is exactly solvable, and we can write its ground-state as the action of a series of projectors onto a given\nreference state. It is important to notice that the reference state should be i) gauge invariant, and ii) not belonging to the kernel of\nthe various B p considered. Indeed, in contrast to what happens for standard LGT, the B p here has only two eigenvalues different\nfrom zero, equal to \u00b11. It is easy to check that a possible reference state fulfilling these requirements is the one depicted in the\ncentral panel of Fig. 4, consisting of two strings each of length L2 /2 wrapping around the lattice of size L \u00d7 L with periodic\n\n\f9\n\nFigure 3: Here, we depict a 4x4 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in both directions. Red qubits are in the state |+i, while blue qubits\nare in the state |\u2212i. The blue qubits form closed string pattern as required by gauge invariance. On the left, we show a possible gauge invariant\nstate of the standard Z2 LGT. On the right, the same plot is presented for the U(1) gauge magnet. In both cases, the states can be mapped to\nclosed string configurations. There is an important difference between the two cases, however. In Z2 LGT, closed strings can form arbitrary\nsmall closed loops. In the U(1) gauge magnet, due to the absence of the states in Fig. 2 b), strings are forced to close by wrapping around the\nwhole lattice. This means that their typical length exceeds that of the linear lattice size. Blue lines are drawn as a guide to the eye to recognize\nthe closed string wrapping around the periodic boundaries of the lattice.\n\nu0\n\nl0\n\n0\n\nr0\n\nd0\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nFigure 4: a) Lattices with an even number of sites and periodic boundary conditions are bipartite. This allow to consider the model with half\nof the plaquettes (filled in yellow in the figure) turned on. In this way, the different yellow plaquettes do not share any link and the U(1) gauge\nmagnet Hamiltonian is built up of mutually commuting terms. This implies that the ground-state is simultaneous eigenvector of all the terms\nappearing in the Hamiltonian. b) Reference state used to construct the ground-state of the Hamiltonian (25) through the action of projectors\n(26). c) An example of reference state used to obtain an excitation with gap \u2206 = 2.\n\nboundary conditions.

Such gap is at least equal to one, corresponding to a state\n\u0010\n\u0011\nO\n|\u03a6({0, p0y })i =\n|1i py \u2297 |0i p0y ,\nB p0y + B\u2020p0 |0i p0y = 0.\n(31)\ny\n\npy 6= p0y\n\nHowever, it is easy to argue that such a state cannot satisfy the gauge invariance requirement on each of the sites at the vertices\nof the plaquette p0y . Hence, |\u03a9(0)i describes a gapped phase with gap 2. The simplest excited state with such energy is\n\u0010\n\u0011\nO\n|\u03a6({\u22121, p0y })i =\n|1i py \u2297 |\u22121i p0y ,\nB p0y + B\u2020p0 |\u22121i p0y = \u2212|\u22121i p0y ,\n(32)\ny\n\npy 6= p0y\n\nas |\u03a6({\u22121, p0y })i \u221d\nN\n\npy 6= p0y ,p00y |1i py\n\nN\n\n1\npy 6= p0y Ppy\n\n0\n00\n\u2297 Pp\u22121\n0 |\u03c80 i. It is worth to notice that first excited states of the form |\u03a6({0, py }, {0, py })i =\ny\n\n\u2297 |0i p0y \u2297 |0i p00y also exist and are gauge invariant, but cannot be obtained just by applying projectors on the\n\nreference state |\u03c80 i as Pp0y |\u03c80 i = 0, \u2200py in the yellow plaquettes' sublattice. In this case, the procedure is more complex and it\ninvolves a B operator acting on a plaquette of the other sublattice, as illustrated in the right pannel of Fig. 4. It is found that\n|\u03a6({0, l0 }, {0, u0 })i \u221d Pd00 Pr00 B0 |\u03a9(0)i,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere d0 , r0 , u0 , l0 are the plaquettes in the yellow sublattice that surrounds the 0 plaquette of the complementary sublattice.\nIn this simple model, we can compute exactly how the presence of static external charges modifies the ground-state. A static\ncharge \u00b11 at site s modifies the gauge condition (7) to\nAs (g)|\u03c8i = exp(\u00b1i\u03b1g )|\u03c8i.\n\n(34)\n\nThat is to say, the presence of static charges modifies the allowed string configurations. Open strings are, indeed, allowed if they\nstart and end on the charges. This, clearly, affects the properties of the ground-state of the system. With two charges \u00b11, the\nground-state is orthogonal to the one without static charges. This implies that we have to change both the reference state and the\nset of projectors, in order to construct the new ground-state\n|\u03a9(0)\u00b1 i \u221d\n\nO\n\nP\u0303py |\u03c8\u00b11 i.\n\n(35)\n\npy\n\nA simple candidate for |\u03c8\u00b11 i can be obtained by transforming one of the two closed strings of |\u2212i contained in |\u03c80 i into an\nopen one. As illustrated in in Fig. 5 for a 4 \u00d7 4 lattice with periodic boundary condition, this can be done by flipping one or\nmore consecutive |\u2212i (blue) links to (red) |+i links. This creates two static charges of opposite charge at the two ends of the\nblue string, where modified gauge condition (34) holds. Two possible choices of the reference state \u03c8\u00b11 , which differ on the\nposition of the static charges, are sketched in Fig. 5. The +1 static charges are denoted by filled black dots, while \u22121 ones by\nempty dots.\nNow, the projectors P\u0303py are determined by the requirement of minimizing the energy while respecting the new gauge condition,\nwhich depends only on the position of the \u00b11 charges. Since the above defined |\u03c8\u00b11 i differ from |\u03c80 i only by few flipped links,\nlocated between the two ends of the open string, the projectors P\u0303py may be distinct from the Pp1y only for the plaquettes py (of the\nyellow lattice) interested by such flips, py \u2208 {flipped region} (pale yellow shaded plaquettes of Fig. 5). In fact, as manifestation\nof orthogonality of the ground-state with back-ground charges to the ground-state without charges, |\u03c8\u00b11 i is annihilated by the\nprojectors (26) acting on the plaquettes between the two ends of the open string. Hence, the proper choice of projectors in such a\nregion, which minimizes the energy and does not annihilate the state, is given by the projector of (28), P\u0303py = Pp0y , \u2200py \u2208 {flipped\nregion}.\nAs a consequence, the ground-state energy of the system with two static charges is higher than the one without the two charges.\nThe energy gap \u2206q is equal to the number of P0 projectors, i.e., the number of yellow plaquettes that contain flipped links. Up\nto artifacts of the discretization, such number is proportional to the number of flipped links itself, nF , i.e., is proportional to the\ndistance r, in lattice spacing unit, between the charges, \u2206q (r) \u221d r. As it can be easily deduced from Fig. 5, the exact relation\nbetween the gap and the number of flipped links is\n\u2206q = nF \u2212 Int[\n\nnF\n],\n2\n\nwhile the distance between the charge depends on nF as\nr\n\u0010\nnF \u0011\nnF\nnF 2\nnF\nr = nF \u2212 Int[ ] (1, 0) + Int[ ](0, 1) = n2F + 2 Int[ ] \u2212 2 nF Int[ ],\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n\f11\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nFigure 5: The presence of static external charges modifies the ground-state. a) Sketch of the reference configuration used to obtain the\nground-state with two static first neighbors charges (presented as filled black dots for charge +1 and empty dots for charge \u22121). The blue\nstring os states |\u2212i is broken in between them. The plaquettes states along the broken part of the string are orthogonal to the eigenstates of\nB p with eigenvalue 1. These plaquette are filled in with a pale shade of yellow in the drawing while regular plaquettes that contribute \u22121\nto the ground-state energy filled in solid yellow. This implies that the ground-state energy in the presence of static charges increases by an\namount\n\u221a proportional to the inter-charge separation, manifestation of charge confinement. b) Sketch of the reference state for charges at distance\nr = 2 2. The reference state induces a further pale yellow plaquette with respect to the reference state on the left and has thus higher energy.\n\nwhere Int[x] is the integer part of x. The above formula is obtained by taking in account the \"zig-zag\" behavior the displacement\nof the charges shows when one additional link is flipped.\nThese two relations together are the footprint of charge confinement, a phenomenon that the present model shares with many\nother gauge theories, among them, QCD. This means that the gap scales as\n\u2206q (r) = \u03c3 r,\nwhere \u03c3 is called string tension. In the long distance regime, i.e., nF \u001d 1, it follows that \u2206q \u223c\nand the string tension for this model is \u03c3 \u223c\n\n(36)\nnF\n2\n\nand r \u223c\n\nnF\n\u221a\n,\n2\n\nhence, \u2206q \u223c\n\n\u221ar ,\n2\n\n\u221a1 .\n2\n\nAt this point, we consider the effect of the link term for \u03b8 6= 0. By the Hamiltonian cos \u03b8 H0 + sin \u03b8 \u2211l (Xl (g) + Xl\u2020 (g)).\nThe last term of the Hamiltonian, cos \u03b8 H0 + sin \u03b8 \u2211l (Xl (g) + Xl\u2020 (g)) is certainly dominant close to \u03b8 = \u03c02 . In this phase, the\nground-state is the product state\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\nO\n|\u03a9\ni=\n|\u2212il ,\n(37)\n2\nl\nregardless of the \u03b1g we have chosen to represent a generic U(1) element g. Hence, one expects to encounter a phase transition\nwhen \u03b8 grows from zero to \u03c02 . We observe that i)\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\nH0 |\u03a9\ni = 0,\n(38)\n2\ni.e., the expectation value of the plaquette part of the Hamiltonian vanishes in the ground-state at \u03b8 = \u03c02 , and, as well, ii)\n\n\u2211 (Xl + Xl\u2020 )|1i p = 4(1 + cos \u03b1g )|1i p , \u2200p,\n\n(39)\n\nl\u2208p\n\nwhich\u0001implies \u2211l (Xl + Xl\u2020 )|\u03a9(0)i = (1 + cos \u03b1g )L2 |\u03a9(0)i. From i) and ii), it immediately follows that the states |\u03a9(0)i and\n|\u03a9 \u03c02 i are not deformed, but simply shifted in energy, by the change of \u03b8 . Hence, the transition between them is a first\norder phase transition (level crossing) where the expectation value of any (yellow) plaquette operator can be taken as an order\nparameter which jumps abruptly from \u22121 to 0.\nFurthermore, the relations (38,39)\nallow to compute the critical value of the coupling \u03b8c simply by equating the energy per\n\u0001\nplaquette of |\u03a9(0)i and |\u03a9 \u03c02 i\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 cos(\u03b1g )\n\u03b8c : \u2212 cos \u03b8c + 4 sin \u03b8c (1 + cos \u03b1g ) = 8 sin(\u03b8c ) cos(\u03b1g ), \u2192 \u03b8c = arctan\n.\n(40)\n4\nAlso in the product state phase, static charges are confined. The minimal configuration containing to two charge excitations of\nopposite sign, \u00b11, is given by the shortest open string of |+i-links connecting the charges. These configurations have an energy\n\n\f12\n2.5\n2\n\n\u2206\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\ncw\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 6: Scaling of the gap \u2206 between the ground-state and the first excited state of the Hamiltonian of (41) as a function of the coupling cw\nfor a 4 \u00d7 4 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. The gap decreases and eventually saturates to its finite size value. On a\ninfinite lattice the results of [50] predict that it would vanishes at the point at cw = 1.\n\ncost per link that is constant and equal to 2 \u2212 2 cos(\u03b1g ). Again, the linear behavior of energy gap with the charge distance is a\nmanifestation of the confinement of charges.\nFinally, we are ready to study the whole Hamiltonian (18). We notice that although the actual shape of ground-state in the\nplaquette dominated phase |\u03a9(0)i is modified, the conditions (38-39) are not, as the plaquette ground-state has always an equal\nnumber of plus and minus links. This implies just a change in the actual value of \u03b8c , but not in the nature of the phase transition\nthat remains a first order level-crossing phase transition.\nHence, all the properties of the plaquette dominated phase can be studied at \u03b8 = 0, as a change of \u03b8 only induces a shift in the\nenergy of such state and of the states associated to plaquette excitations.\nIn order to obtain the full gauge magnet Hamiltonian, we can add the other half of the plaquettes to the Hamiltonian (25)\nadiabatically\nHcw = \u2212 \u2211(B py + B\u2020py ) \u2212 cw \u2211(B pw + B\u2020pw )\npy\n\n(41)\n\npw\n\nwhere pw are the white plaquettes in Fig. 4. By varying cw from 0 to 1 the system is driven to a gap-less phase, [50]. The\ndependence of the gap on cw for the 4 \u00d7 4 lattice is shown in Fig. 6. There we appreciate that the gap systematically decreases\nand eventually saturates to its finite size value.\nWe conclude the section by making a comparison between the regular and the two-dimensional representation of U(1) LGT.\nThe truncated formulation has the clear advantage of being easier to handle numerically, and to simulate in optical lattice. The\nrelevant question is whether the truncated and the non-truncated theories share the same quantum properties. It is worth to notice\nthat the gapless phase encountered here has no analogue in the standard compact U(1) LGT, where the only appearing phase is\nthe gapped confining phase [52].\nThere are several interesting physical phenomena that are however common to both models. Here, we just list two of them,\nwhich we propose in the following section as possible test to check whether the desired physics is correctly realized in the quantum simulator. The first one is related to an important theorem that states that gauge symmetries can not be broken spontaneously\n[46]. The physical consequence of this fact is that only gauge invariant operators can acquire a non-vanishing expectation value.\nThis implies that the expectation value of, i.e., a single Z operator on a link has to be zero, property that can be easily checked\nwith current experimental resources. The second one is related to charge confinement. In the U(1) link model, we have seen that\nboth phases exhibit charge confinement. This is similar to the charge confinement encountered in the Kogut-Susskind formulation of compact U(1) LGT. As discussed in section III E, the presence of charge confinement can be verified experimentally.\nDefinitely, in order to establish the correct relation, beyond analogies, among the standard compact QED and the present link\nmodel \u2013 including a full understanding of the renormalization group flow of the U(1) gauge magnet\u2013 further studies are needed.\nD.\n\nExact diagonalization and Tree Tensor Network of the U(1) gauge model on small lattices\n\nWith a specific choice of open boundary conditions the model is exactly solvable. Here, we performed an exact diagonalization\nof a system with periodic boundary conditions in both directions to see which of the features of the exactly solvable model survive\n\n\f13\n\nFigure 7: In order to perform exact diagonalization on the 4 \u00d7 4 lattice, we need to appropriately reduce the number of degrees of freedom\nby using the constraints induced by gauge invariance. There are several way to perform the reduction. Here, we introduce an RG inspired\nprocedure that can be generalized to larger lattices and would immediately provide a tree tensor network ansatz for symmetric states (see also\n[18]). The procedure consists in identifying blocks of four spins and project only on those configurations selected by the gauge conditions\n(those sketched in Fig. 2). This produces a new lattice of effective sites with dimension 6. We can iterate the procedure and obtain a final layer\nwhere only few spins are left. At this point, the effective Hamiltonian can be diagonalized directly. If one needs to consider larger lattices, the\nprojection onto gauge invariant states has to be followed by a projection onto low-energy states, such that one can iterate a larger number of\ntime the RG steps. See, e.g., [18, 53].\n\nthe presence of periodic boundary conditions. Clearly, with this approach we are limited to study small systems, up to 4 \u00d7 4.\nFor this reason, we also explain how one can go beyond that, by using the idea presented in [18]. The gauge conditions are,\nindeed, fixed in a RG inspired way, so to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. We can use a 4 \u2192 1 coarse graining scheme\nas follow. We cover the lattice with independent As by chosing one of each two crosses and perform a RG step by keeping only\nthe corresponding 6 eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1 of the corresponding As , from the available 16 states. This reduces the 23 2\ndegree of freedom of the 4 \u00d7 4 lattice to only 86 . The 8 remaining crosses still act on four coarsegrained sites. Now, we can\nrepeat the procedure by fixing two further crosses and select among the 64 states the corresponding 6 \u00d7 34 . In this way, we can\nperform exact diagonalization on the two effective spins. The unused gauge constraints are projected at this level. This procedure\nis sketched in Fig. 7. If we want to deal with systems larger than 4 \u00d7 4 we cannot use the above construction. However, the\nintroduction of an addtional RG step, which projects onto the low-energy subspace of the full Hamiltoniana, allows to study\nsystems up to 10 \u00d7 10 (see, e.g., [53]). This can be done numerically as described in detail in [18].\nIII.\n\nQUANTUM SIMULATION OF THE U(1) GAUGE MAGNET\n\nIn this section, we discuss the quantum simulation of Abelian, in particular U(1), gauge magnets in optical lattices. As the\ngauge magnets may be regarded as a prototype of lattice gauge theories, many of the major issues of the implementation are\ngeneric to any gauge theory.\nA.\n\nMany-body interaction through the Rydberg gate\n\nAn important feature common to gauge theories on a generic lattice is the occurrence of interactions between several links\ntogether, involving at least as many links as the lattice coordination number. As such links appear in the dual lattice as sites, it\nimplies the existence of a long range interaction between several sites at once. The aforementioned feature is very hard to be\nsimulated. For instance, it is very hard to engineer in a controlled way such an interaction between cold atoms loaded in optical\nlattices. Such problem disfavors the analogic simulation of lattice gauge theory, i.e., the implementation of the gauge theory\nHamiltonian as the effective Hamiltonian of the controlled system.\nThe alternative is to consider a digital quantum simulation, i.e., the simulation of time-evolution of gauge theories via quantum\ngates. Its realization requires the capability of assigning a certain phase to a set of links,phases determined by the expectation\nvalue of each multilink operator entering the Hamiltonian of interest. The gates that implement these operations are generalizations of C-NOT gates, and the key role of control over links at distance is played by Rydberg atoms [54].\nRydberg atoms are highly excited states that are long lived and have a huge dipolar moment [55, 56]. The latter gives raise\nto the phenomenon known as blockade: once a Rydberg atom has been laser induced, a volume of several \u03bcm is affected by\nits dipole field causing level shifts in the surrounding atoms, and, hence, forbidding the creation of another Rydberg excitation\nin such volume. Several experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to create entanglement over an extended region in a\n(laser) controlled way by exploiting such strong dipolar interaction [57].\n\n\f14\na)\n\nLasers\n\nSequence of laser pulses\nc)\n\nb)\nControl\n\nEnsemble\n\nControl\n\nEnsemble\n\nV\n\nControl atom\n\nEnsamble atom\n\nB\n\nB\n\nFigure 8: Schematic of the Rydberg gate. In the block of the left, the geometric disposition of the ensemble and control atoms is shown. The\nensemble atoms, which admit as logical states |Ai and |Bi, are placed sufficiently close to the control atom, whom logic states are |0i and |1i, so\nthat the Rydberg interaction, i.e., the dipole interaction in the Rydberg state of the control, is strong (shadow green volume). At the same time,\nthe atoms are sufficiently separated to allow individual single-site addressing by laser pulses. In the block of the right, the pulses, needed to the\nconditional transfer from the logical state |Ai to the logical state |Bi of the ensemble atoms, and the level scheme are displayed. a) Sequence of\nthe pulses (not in scale). The \u03c0-pulse of Rabi frequency \u03a9r (in red) is applied on the control atom only and induces resonant transition between\nlevel |1i and the Rydberg excited state |ri. Such pulse is short and applied twice, at the beginning and at the end of conditional transfer. The\npulse of Rabi frequency \u03a9c (in blue) and the \u03c0-pulse of Rabi frequency \u03a9 p (in cyan) act both on all the ensemble atoms simultaneously. The\nformer is shining continuously and much more intense than the latter, which is smoothly ramped up and down. b) Level scheme for the control\ninitialized in |0i. In this case, the pulse \u03a9r does not play any role. The \u03c0-pulse \u03a9 p connects with an (off-resonant) two-photon transition\nbetween the states |Ai and |Bi of the ensemble atoms. The frequency of the pulse \u03a9c is such that \u03a9c + \u03a9 p connect the logic states |Ai and |Bi\nto the Rydberg excited state |Ri with a resonant two phon transition. As \u03a9c \u001d \u03a9 p , the Electromagnetic induced transparency scheme (EIT) is\nrealized and the transfer between |Ai and |Bi inhibited. c) Level scheme for the control initialized in |1i. In this case, the pulse \u03a9r excites the\ncontrol to the Rydberg state |ri. Due to dipole interaction the Rydberg state of the ensemble |Ri gets shifted in energy by V and it is no longer\nin a two-photon resonant transition with the logical state |Ai and |Bi. Hence, the transfer between |Ai and |Bi occurs.\n\nIndeed, due to the blockade, the presence/absence of a Rydberg excitation plays the role of an ideal control qubit, as it may\ntrigger or forbid laser stimulated transitions in all the atoms in the blockade volume, for instance all the atoms trapped in a unit\ncell of a lattice. The explicit realization of this idea has been pushed forward in [32], where the authors propose the mesoscopic\nRydberg gate scheme, which is sketched in Fig. 8. Let us review briefly the main feature of this gate: for more details and for the\nanalysis of the fidelity we refer the reader to the original reference. Let us consider a set of N + 1 qubits, one of which playing\nthe role of the control. The logic states of the control {|0i, |1i}, and of the remaining ensemble qubits, {|Aik , |Bik }, k = 1, . . . , N,\nare hyperfine states of atoms. The goal is to achieve a protocol such that the ensemble states are untouched when the control is\nin |0i while induces a flip |Aik \u2194 |Bik when the control is in |1i. In formula, this reads\n!\nG = |0ih0| \u2297 1N + |1ih1| \u2297\n\nN\nO\n\n\u03c3kx ,\n\n(42)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere 1N is the identity in the space of the ensemble qubits and \u03c3 x is the Pauli matrix acting as \u03c3kx |Aik = |Bik , \u03c3kx |Bik = |Aik ,\n\u2200k = 1, . . . , N. We may suppose that both the control and the ensemble atoms are trapped in different sites of an optical lattice\nand that we have single site addressing. All the atoms can be excited by laser pulses to Rydberg states, which we indicate as |ri\nand |Rik for the control and the ensemble atoms, respectively. |ri and |Rik can be in principle different. The key idea is to use\na Electromagnetic Induced Transparency (EIT) [58] in a modified Lambda scheme. Three different \u03c0-pulses are employed with\nRabi frequency \u03a9r , \u03a9c and \u03a9 p , respectively. The first one is applied to the control at the beginning and at the end of the process\nand it is resonant between |1i and |ri. This implies that the control is excited to the Rydberg state only when it is in the logic\nstate |1i. The other two lasers are such that the sum of their frequencies is exactly resonant with the transition |Aik , |Bik \u2192 |Rik\nwhen the control atom is not in the Rydberg state |ri, while it is off resonant when the strong dipole-dipole interaction is present\n(a more accurate discussion should take into account also the effect of simultaneous Rydberg excitations in the ensemble atom as\ndone originally in [32]; such extra-dipole interactions can be kept under control and the functionality of the gate is not spoiled).\nTogether with the condition \u2206 \u001d \u03a9c \u001d \u03a9 p , where \u2206 is the smallest detuning of the p-laser from an intermediate atomic level\n|Pi, the above construction ensures that no transfer between |Aik and |Bik occurs when they are in two-photons resonance with\n|Rik , i.e., the control is in |0i; on the contrary the transfer occurs with efficiency one in the absence of the two-photons resonance\ni.e., the control is in |1i. This ideal result is not spoiled once the losses due to spontaneous decay of the long-live atomic states\nare taken into account.\nBefore moving to the applications of such gate to the simulation of the gauge magnets, two comments are in order. First, the\n\n\f15\n\nEnsemble atoms\nControl atoms\n\nFigure 9: Schematic of the simulator. As indicated in the legend, the red dots represent the ensemble atoms, while the blue dots represent\nthe control ones. Between the control atoms, we distinguish the ones at the lattice sites (intersections of continuous lines) and the ones at the\ncenter of the plaquettes. The former are needed to impose the gauge condition and interact with the ensemble atoms at the corners of the green\nsquares. The latter control the dynamics of the plaquettes, which involves the ensemble atoms at the corner of the yellows squares.\n\nmesoscopic Rydberg gate can be modified to get any G0 of the form\n!\n0\n\nG = |0ih0| \u2297 1N + |1ih1| \u2297\n\nN\nO\nk=1\n\ne\n\n\u03b1\n\u03c3k\ni 2g n\u0302k *\u03c3\n\n=\n\nN\nO\n\nUk (n\u0302k ) |0ih0| \u2297 1N + |1ih1| \u2297\n\nk=1\n\nN\nO\n\ne\n\n\u03b1\ni 2g \u03c3kx\n\n!!\n\nk=1\n\nN\nO\n\u2020\n\nUk (n\u0302k ),\n\n(43)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03b1g is any real number between 0 and 2\u03c0, n\u0302k a generic 3-vector of modulus 1, \u03c3 \u2261 (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ), and Uk (n\u0302k ) the unitary\ntransformations in each single qubit space. Indeed, the \u03b1g dependence is simple obtained by considering an \u03b1g -pulse for the\nlasers c and p instead of the \u03c0-pulse considered originally in the mesoscopic Rydberg gate. On the other hand, in order to get\nthe \u03c3 combination n\u0302k * \u03c3 , the single site addressability is exploited to perform the appropriate rotation of each qubit basis. This\noperation obviously amounts to apply single qubit gates on the ensemble atoms before and after the G gate.\nSecond, as originally shown in [33], the mesoscopic Rydberg gate can be used to read out the expectation of a (two-valued)\noperator on the ensemble atoms and transfer the information to the control qubit, once combined with rotations on the control\nitself. Indeed, let us consider the effect of the unitary transformation\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nG\u0303 = exp[i \u03c3cy ] G exp[\u2212i \u03c3cy ],\n4\n4\nonce the control qubit is initialized in |0i. For a generic state of the ensemble atoms |\u03bb i = \u03b1g |\u03bb+ i +\n\n(44)\nq\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b1g2 |\u03bb\u2212 i, where\n\nwith |\u03bb\u00b1 i are eigenvectors of Oe \u2261 k \u03c3kx , Oe |\u03bb\u00b1 i = \u00b1|\u03bb\u00b1 i, and |\u03b1g | < 1, the final state of the control is computed to be\nq\n|ci = \u03b1g |0i + 1 \u2212 \u03b1g2 |1i. Furthermore, by inverting G\u0303, any single qubit operation applied to the control can be mapped to\nN\n\nthe ensemble state, i.e., on the logical qubit composed by |\u03bb+ i and |\u03bb\u2212 i. In case we are interested to read a more complicated\noperator, as in (43), appropriate rotations of the ensemble qubits are required as well, G\u03030 = exp[i \u03c04 \u03c3cy ] G0 exp[\u2212i \u03c04 \u03c3cy ].\nB.\n\nDissipative preparation HG as ground-state preparation of frustration-free Hamiltonian\n\nWe are now ready to discuss in full detail the protocol for the simulation of the gauge magnets. The link qubits are identified\nwith the logical states of the ensemble atoms (see Fig. 9). For convenience, we choose the following relation between the\n{|+i, |\u2212i} link basis of section II C and the logical (atomic level) basis {|Ai, |Bi}\n|\u00b1i =\n\n|Ai \u00b1 |Bi\n\u221a\n.\n2\n\n(45)\n\nThe first conceptual and practical step is to impose the gauge condition (7), i.e., to reduce the possible states of the system to the\ngauge invariant ones. It is worth to notice that this is equivalent to find the (highly degenerate) ground-state of the Hamiltonian\n\n\f16\nHcond = \u2212 12 \u2211s (As (g) + A\u2020s (g)), with g a generic element of ZN or of U(1) such that gn 6= e for n < N, or for any n, respectively.\nIn the U(1) case, we may choose Hcond to be\nHcond \u2261 \u2211 hscond = \u2212\ns\n\n\u03b1g x\n\u03b1g x\n\u03b1g x\n\u03b1g x\n1\nei 2 \u03c3s1 \u2297 ei 2 \u03c3s2 \u2297 e\u2212i 2 \u03c3s3 \u2297 e\u2212i 2 \u03c3s4 + H.c.,\n\u2211\n2 s\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u03b1g is any integer, for instance 1.\nIndependently of the specific election for Hcond , it is, evidently, a frustration-free Hamiltonian: each local term commutes\nwith the others, and the ground-state can be obtained by minimizing each local term separately. In this situation, a dissipative\npreparation of the ground-state, as originally proposed in [38, 40], and applied to quantum simulation in [33] (for a very recent\nreview see [59]), is appropriate. The idea of dissipative preparation is very simple and corresponds to a classical cooling. That\nis to say that each time the local state has no minimal energy is transformed to a minimal energy eigenstate by a local operation.\nLet us detail the procedure in the case of (46). Our aim is to read out the expectation of As (hscond ) on the local state and to\nchange it, for instance by flipping an ensemble qubit, if is not satisfying the gauge condition (or equivalently hhscond i = \u22121). As\nour local state is given by the four links attached to a site and As is a unitary operation that can be conditionally implemented\n(see discussion above) by the mesoscopic Rydberg gate, the required operation is obtained with the gate sequence\nUD = G\u0303(As )\u2020Usz,\u03c6 G\u0303(As ),\n\u03c0\n\ny\n\n\u03c0\n\n(47)\n\ny\n\nwhere G\u0303(As ) = ei 4 \u03c3c (|0ih0| \u2297 1s + |1ih1| \u2297 As )e\u2212i 4 \u03c3c = 21 1c \u2297 (1s + As ) + 21 \u03c3cx \u2297 (As \u2212 1s ), and\nUsz,\u03c6 = |0ih0| \u2297 1s + |1ih1| \u2297 \u03a3(\u03c6),\nz\n\nis the conditional flipping of one of the links entering s with probability \u03c6, let say s1 , \u03a3(\u03c6) = ei\u03c6\u03c3s1 .\nTwo comments are in order. First, we note that the spin flip \u03a3(\u03c6) is not necessary projecting the local state |\u03c8is to the\nsubspace hAs i = 1 in one step, even for \u03c6 = \u03c0/2. Furthermore, if hscond |\u03c8is = \u2212 cos(2\u03b1g )|\u03c8is , it follows that hscond \u03a3( \u03c02 )|\u03c8is =\n\u2212 cos(\u03b1g )\u03a3( \u03c02 )|\u03c8is but if hscond |\u03c8is = \u2212 cos(\u03b1g )|\u03c8is , it is found \u03a3( \u03c02 )|\u03c8is has component on the \u22121 and \u2212 cos(2\u03b1g ) subspace\nq\nwith amplitudes 34 and 12 [60]. That is to say, the \"energy\" is not monotonically decreasing at each step. However, the relation\nabove is telling us that, by iterating the process, the probability of the state to be excited is exponentially suppressed, as the\nprobability of being reheated scales like ( 41 )n/2 , n \u2261 # of steps.\nSecond, it is worth to notice that the operation UD is unitary, but the dissipation enters in the game as, in order to iterate UD ,\nwe need to reset the control qubit to |0ic . As explained in [33], such decoupling of the control dynamics can be obtained by\ninducing a radiative decay of |1ic . This implies that the final result of one dissipative iteration is a mixed state. Indeed, by\nnaming |\u03c8is any initial pure local state and assuming that the control qubit is initialized in |0i, the action of UD is\nU\n\nD\n|0i \u2297 |\u03c8is \u2212\u2192\n|0i \u2297 |\u03c60 is + |1i \u2297 |\u03c61 is ,\n\n(48)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nAs + A\u2020s (A\u2020s \u2212 1s )\u03a3(\u03c6)(As \u2212 1s )\n|\u03c60 is =\n1+\n+\n|\u03c8is ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(49)\n\nwhere\n\n1\n|\u03c61 is =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nA\u2020s \u2212 As (A\u2020s + 1s )\u03a3(\u03c6)(As \u2212 1s )\n+\n|\u03c8is .\n2\n2\n\n(50)\n\nThis means that, in consequence of the decay of |1i to |0i, the density matrix after a dissipation step evolves as\nDissipation\n\n|0i \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|s \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 |\u03c60 ih\u03c60 |s + |\u03c61 ih\u03c61 |s .\n\n(51)\n\nThe most efficient cooling procedure is for \u03c6 = \u03c02 . However, as discussed in [33], it is possible to show that, in the limit of small\n\u03c6, the above cooling procedure is governed by a master equation of the Lindblad form. By defining the jump operators\nc0 \u2261 \u2212\n\n(1 \u2212 A\u2020s )\u03c31z (1 \u2212 As )\n= c\u20200 ,\n4\n\nc1 \u2261\n\nthe expansion of (49) and (50) in \u03c6 around \u03c6 = 0 takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c62 2\n\u2020\n3\n|\u03c60 is = 1 \u2212 i\u03c6c0 \u2212 (c0 + c1 c1 ) + O(\u03c6 ) |\u03c8is ,\n2\n\n(1 + A\u2020s )\u03c31z (1 \u2212 As )\n,\n4\n\n\u0001\n|\u03c61 is = \u2212i\u03c6c1 + O(\u03c6 2 ) |\u03c8is ,\n\n(52)\n\n(53)\n\n\f17\nwhich implies that the variation of \u03c1 after one cooling step can be written up to second order in \u03c6 as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 2\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2\n\u2206\u03c1 = \u2206t \u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i\u03c6[c0 , \u03c1] + \u03c6 c0 \u03c1c0 + c1 \u03c1c1 \u2212 {(c0 + c1 c1 ), \u03c1} + O(\u03c6 3 ),\n2\n\n(54)\n\nwhere \u2206t is the time needed for a the single time step. It is immediate to see that the above equation has no other fixed points\nthan a density matrix built up of pure states, \u03c1 = \u2211 j |\u03c8 j ih\u03c8 j |, satisfying As |\u03c8 j i = |\u03c8 j i, \u2200 j. In comparison to [33], we find that\ntwo jump operators are associated to the cooling procedure and the presence of a coherent term linear in \u03c6, which is not affecting\nthe convergence as it is zero on the gauge invariant subspace.\nC.\n\nUnitary evolution of the U(1) gauge magnet\n\nOnce the gauge condition has been successfully implemented, we can focus on the dynamics of U(1) gauge magnet, governed\nby the Hamiltonian (18). As explained above, our goal is to implement the unitary evolution Ut = e\u2212iHt in terms of local unitary\ngates [33]. The simplest way to do it is to exploit the Trotter expansion to write\n\u0011t\n\u0010\n\u2206t\nUt \u223c \u220f e\u2212iHp \u2206t e\u2212i(\u2211l Hl )\u2206t\n,\n\n(55)\n\np\n\nwhere H p and Hl are the plaquette, H p = \u2212 cos \u03b8 (B p + B\u2020p ), and the link Hl = sin \u03b8 (Xl + Xl\u2020 ) terms, respectively. As the Rydberg\ngate are sufficiently fast (\u2206t ' \u03bcs) compared with temperatures achieved for the atoms in the lattice, the above approximation is\nconsistent and we can treat each term as commuting in the time-evolution.\nLet us focus first in the implementation of the link part. As the Xl commute between them, such term is just a product of the\nx\nsingle qubit rotation Ul = e\u2212i(1+cos \u03b1g )t e\u2212i(1\u2212cos \u03b1g )t\u03c3l applied to each link. Thus, its implementation is straightforward.\nOn the other hand, the plaquette term is slightly more involved. The easiest way to treat this term is to expand explicitly the\nexponential into a sum of tensor product of \u03c3 . In orderz to reduce\nthe number\nof terms to be simulated, we may use the Trotter\ny\n\u2020 = \u03c3 z +i\u03c3 y , respectively, we have\nexpansion further. As Z and Z \u2020 can be written as Z = \u03c3 \u2212i\u03c3\nand\nZ\n2\n2\ncos \u03b8 8 ( j)\n\u2211 Qp\n8 j=1\ncos \u03b8\n= \u2212\n(\u03c3 z )\u22974 + (\u03c3 y )\u22974 + (\u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 y )\u22972 + (\u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z )\u22972 + \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z + \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 y\n8\n\u0001\n\u2212(\u03c3 z )\u22972 \u2297 (\u03c3 y )\u22972 \u2212 (\u03c3 y )\u22972 \u2297 (\u03c3 z )\u22972 ,\n\nHp \u2261 \u2212\n\n(56)\n\nwhich gives\n8\n\ne\u2212iHp \u2206t \u223c \u220f ei\n\ncos \u03b8\n8\n\n( j)\n\nQ p \u2206t\n\n.\n\n(57)\n\nj=1\n\nNow, each of the above unitaries can be implemented using Rydberg gates as explained in [33], by applying the sequence\nei\n( j)\n\ncos \u03b8\n8\n\n( j)\n\nQ p \u2206t\n\n( j)\n\n= G\u0303(Q p )\u2020 ei\n\ncos \u03b8\n8\n\n\u2206t\u03c3cz\n\n( j)\n\nG\u0303(Q p ),\n\n(58)\n\n( j)\n\nfor G\u0303(Q p ) = exp[i \u03c04 \u03c3cy ](|0ih0| \u2297 1 p + |1ih1| \u2297 Q p ) exp[\u2212i \u03c04 \u03c3cy ], which is of the form of (43).\nIt is worth to conclude with a final remark on the preservation of gauge invariance during the above process. In principle, as\nthe Hamiltonian commutes with the gauge condition (7), the time-evolution conserves the gauge condition, i.e., it is not driving\nthe system out of the gauge invariance subspace. In fact, in order to minimizing possible violations of the gauge condition due\nto dephasing it is worth to keep applying the dissipative process while other unitary operations are performed. By doing so, the\nunitary evolution is not altered.\nD.\n\nProposal for the preparation of the U(1) gauge magnet ground-state\n\nWe are finally ready to discuss the preparation of the U(1) gauge magnet ground-state. As in the link dominated phase the\nground-state is a fully polarized product state that can be efficiently prepared using single site addressing, we focus on the\nplaquette dominated phase. Our plan is to realize in practice the procedure explained in section II C. Hence, the idea is to\n\n\f18\nconstruct the ground-state in two steps. First, we apply the dissipative procedure to the frustration-free Hamiltonian obtained\nconsidering half of the plaquette (for instance the yellow ones in Fig. 4) in order to find the corresponding ground-state |\u03a9(0)i\ndefined by (29) and (30), and, then, we drive such state, adiabatically or using the CRAB procedure [42], to the ground-state of\nthe full plaquette Hamiltonian. It is worth to notice that prior to the ground-state preparation it is not necessary to impose the\ngauge condition as |\u03a9(0)i is gauge invariant by construction. However, for the driving, the final remark of the previous section\napplies.\nThe procedure explained above works for any chosen background of static charged matter, once the proper initial state is\nprepared and the right gauge condition is applied at site. As in section II C, we focus on 1) the preparation of the ground-state in\nthe absence of charges and on 2) the preparation of the ground-state in presence of two isolated + and - charges.\n1.\n\nPreparation of the ground-state in the absence of charges\n\nThe preparation of the initial state to be driven can be obtained by applying the discussion of section III B to the local\nHamiltonian H p , p \u2208{yellow plaquettes}. We note that the unitary operator UHp \u2261 exp[i \u03c02 (B p + B\u2020p )] acts on the eigenvector of\nH p (see definitions (30-32)) as\nUHp |1i p = |1i p ,\n\nUHp |\u22121i p = \u2212|\u22121i p ,\n\nUHp |0i p = \u2212i|0i p ,\n\n(59)\n\ni.e., in a very similar way to the star operator As . That is to say, we can get the right dissipative process just by substituting As\nwith UHp in the gate derived in section III B. However, the C-NOT gate |0ih0| \u2297 1 p + |1ih1| \u2297 UHp is hard to be implemented\nexactly (i.e., without applying Trotter approximation) using Rydberg gates.\nN\nWe can bypass easily such difficulty by exploiting the exact knowledge of |\u03a9(0)i = p\u2208{Yell.pl.} |1i p , where the local state\n|1i p can be explicitly written by ordering the links of plaquette anticlockwise starting from the bottom as\n1\n|1i p = \u221a (|+, +, \u2212, \u2212i p + |\u2212, \u2212, +, +i p ) .\n2\n\n(60)\n\nWe observe that such a state is completely determined by: i) being a combination of states with an equal number of + and \u2212, ii)\nbeing the stabilizer state of both Ox \u2261 \u03c3 x \u2297 \u03c3 x \u2297 1 \u2297 1 and Oz \u2261 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z i.e., satisfying O\u03bc |1i p = |1i p , \u03bc = x, z.\nThe condition\nN i) can be realized in different ways. As suggested in section II C, the most direct one is to prepare the product\nstate |\u03c80 i = p\u2208{Yell.pl.} |+, +, \u2212, \u2212i p by exploiting single addressing. As an alternative, we could first impose the gauge\ncondition and, then, repeat the dissipative procedure of section III B by choosing as local state the (yellow) plaquettes, as unitary\nz\nz\noperator A p = exp[i \u03c04 \u03c3 x ]\u22974 , and as flip operator the simultaneous rotation of two plaquette's qubit by \u03c3 z , \u03a3 = ei\u03c6\u03c31 \u2297 ei\u03c6\u03c32 .\nIndeed, the gauge condition ensures that the initial plaquette state has an even number of + and the double flip converts states\nwith zero o four + in a desired state.\nThe condition ii), once i) is realized, can be achieved by applying the Kraus maps for Bell state pumping engineered in [61].\nIndeed, let us suppose that we have prepared the state |\u03c80 i. Hence, we have to impose by dissipation only hOz i = 1 on the\nplaquette state as Ox |\u03c80 i = 1 by construction. The dissipative gate\n\u03c0\n\nG\u0303(Oz )\u2020U z,\u03c6= 2 G\u0303(Oz ) + radiative decay|1i \u2192 |0i\ndoes the job in one step.\nNow, we are ready to turn on the remaining plaquette interactions. This can be done by increasing the coupling constant cw\nin (41) adiabatically from 0 to 1. From the digital simulation point of view, this means that unitary time-evolution procedure of\nsection III C has applied to the plaquette Hamiltonian (41), where cw is changed smoothly, for instance linearly, from an iteration\nto an other. However, as first shown in [50] and reviewed in section II C, in the infinite dimensional system, the plaquette\ndominated phase becomes gapless as cw approaches 1, with the gap that scales as c12 . This means that the adiabatic driving for\nw\na finite system is still possible but it becomes harder and harder as the dimension of the lattice increases. This implies that the\nramping time has to be taken bigger and bigger. In order to reduce such time, optimal control techniques can be used. Between\nthem, the so call CRAB method [41], which has been successfully employed, for instance, to dramatically reduce the time\nneeded to bring a superfluid gas into a Mott insulator state [42], seems very promising as it allows for closed-loop optimization\nexperiments. The idea is to find the optimal function cw (t), satisfying cw (0) = 0, such that after a time T minimizes a cost\nfunction F , which in our case is a linear combination of the energy of the driven state computed with the final Hamiltonian\ncw = 1 and the fluences, a measure of the oscillation of cw (t). The novel feature of the CRAB method is that the optimal driving\n(I)\n(I\u22121)\nat the step I, cw (t), is obtained by minimizing F with respect to few free parameters pk in the driving probes cw (t) \u2211 pk gk (t).\n\u03c0\nThe gk (t) are element of a favorite orthonormal basis, for instance the Fourier basis gk (t) = cos(k T t). In order to further improve\nthe convergence, the frequencies wk = k T\u03c0 may be randomly perturbed wk \u2192 wk +rk . One then feeds the result of the optimization\nback to the algorithm so that the final energy is improved further up to convergence.\n\n\f19\n\u22125.5\n\nLinear ramp\n\n\u22126\n\nEnergy\n\n\u22126.5\n\u22127\n\u22127.5\nE1\n\n\u22128\n\nCRAB\n\n0\n\n\u22128.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nt\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 10: Comparison between linear and CRAB protocol drivings. The preparation of the ground-state of the gauge magnet Hamiltonian\n(41) is performed in a given time, shorter than the adiabatic one. The blue line represents a linear ramp from cw = 0 to cw = 1. The red curve\nrepresents the result of one optimization cycle of a CRAB preparation with seven random frequencies as free parameters [41]. The horizontal\nlines represent the energies of the ground-state and the first excited state. It can be appreciated how the linear map fails completely to deliver\nthe desired ground-state while the CRAB map gets very closed to it.\n\nWe have numerically tested the CRAB method up to a 4 \u00d7 4 lattice, where we are still able to compute the exact groundstate for cw = 1 using exact diagonalization. One has to keep in mind that the energy of the final state of the time-evolution\nis monotonically decreasing with the number of iterations. Since each iteration takes very long (typically around a week on a\nstandard PC) we have decided to stop our optimization algorithm as soon as the final energy got well below the energy of the\nfirst excited state. This typically happens after only one optimization cycle. For the sake of comparison we report in Fig. 10 the\nenergy of the state along its time-evolution and compare it with respect to the energy of the state obtained using a linear ramp\nthat goes from cw = 0 to cw = 1, in the same amount of time. It can be clearly seen how out of the adiabatic regime the linear\nramp fails completely to prepare the ground-state, as the evolution is by far too fast, while the CRAB optimization with only one\niteration gets very closed to it.\n\n2.\n\nPreparation of the ground-state in presence of two isolated + and - charges\n\nIn presence of two isolated + and - charges, two main difference in the preparation occur. First, the initial state to be driven,\ni.e. the ground-state of the system with only half of the plaquettes turned on (the yellow sublattice of Fig. 4), is different.\nIndeed, as explained in section II C, it is again a product state of eigenvectors of the plaquettes turned on, but it differs from the\nground-state in the absence of charges on few plaquettes, which we called flipped. On the flipped plaquettes, gauge invariance\nforces to take an eigenvector of eigenvalue 0. Furthermore, the flipped plaquettes can only occupy a continuous segment of\na southeast-northwest diagonal of the sublattice, see Fig. 5. Accordingly, the charges can be placed consistently with gauge\ninvariance only on the sites of the first and last plaquette of the segment. To be precise, a charge can occupy all the sites except\nthe one shared with the contiguous flipped plaquette of the interior. Hence, by definition the flipped plaquettes of the interior\ncontains no charges. The position of the charges fully determines which are states on the flipped plaquettes. Let assume for\nconvenience that the positive charge is on the first flipped plaquette at the bottom-left and the negative one is on the last at the\ntop-right. It follows that the proper state for the plaquettes in the interior of the segment is |+ + ++i. For the plaquettes on the\nfrontier we have two possibility: the charge occupies the site, d, on the diagonal of the segment (not shared with other flipped\nplaquettes), or it occupies one of the two off diagonal. In the former case the state is again |+ + ++i. In the latter, the link\nconnecting d with the site of the charge is in |\u2212i with all the other links are in |+i. Hence, it follows that the plaquette at the\nbottom-left is in the state |\u2212 + ++i if the charge is below the diagonal or in |+ + +\u2212i if the charge is above. Similarly, the\nplaquette at the top-right is in the state |+ \u2212 ++i if the charge is below the diagonal or in |+ + \u2212+i if the charge is above.\nSuch states can be easily prepared by single-site addressing or using dissipation. It is worth to notice that the configuration with\nthe positive charge at the top-right can be obtained from the one above by combining a \u03c0-rotation of the lattice, which puts the\ncharges in the desired configuration but reverses the orientation, with the flip of the state of each link, |+i \u2194 |\u2212i, which restores\nthe right orientation. Hence, the preparation of initial state to be driven in presence of charges does not imply much more effort\nthan the preparation of the not-charged one.\nThe other difference in preparation of the ground-state with charge with respect to case without is that the gauge condition\nto be enforced during the driving in order to minimize the error is different. Indeed, on the site where \u00b11 charge is placed the\n\n\f20\ngauge condition reads\nAs\u00b1 |\u03c8i = e\u00b1i\u03b1 |\u03c8i.\n\n(61)\n\nThis means that the dissipative procedure has to force the eigenvalue 1 of the operator A0s\u00b1 = e\u2213i\u03b1 As\u00b1 . By noticing that\n\u0001\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 z\ne\u00b1i 2 \u03c3c G(A) = e\u00b1i 2 G(A0 ) = e\u00b1i 2 |0ih0| \u2297 1 + |1ih1| \u2297 e\u2213i\u03b1 A ,\nwe conclude that the correct gauge condition can be imposed via the modified version of dissipative sequence (47)\n\n\u03c0\n\ny\n\n\u03b1\n\nz\n\n\u03c0\n\ny\n\nwhere G\u0303(A0s\u00b1 ) = ei 4 \u03c3c e\u00b1i 2 \u03c3c G(As\u00b1 )e\u2212i 4 \u03c3c\n\nUD\u00b1 = G\u0303(A0s\u00b1 )\u2020Usz,\u03c6\nG\u0303(A0s\u00b1 ),\n(62)\n\u00b1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1s +e\u2213i\u03b1 As\ne\u2213i\u03b1 As\u00b1 \u22121s\u00b1\n= e\u00b1i 2 1c \u2297 \u00b1 2 \u00b1 + \u03c3cx \u2297\n, as the phase e\u00b1i 2 cancels out in\n2\n\nthe gate.\nE.\n\nValidation and usefulness of the simulator: absence of symmetry breaking and confinement\n\nOnce the proposed experiment has been realized, one has to be able to ensure that the simulator is indeed behaving as expected,\nand thus validate the results. This is in general a non-trivial task [62]. In the case of a gauge theory simulation, there are, however,\nat least two expected properties that one could use as a \"smoking gun\" of the desired physics.\nFirst, one can check that the expectation value of any non-gauge invariant operator is zero as predicted by gauge invariance for\nwell defined, i.e., non anomalous gauge theories like the gauge magnet under scrutiny. The simplest of such operators are (twice)\nthe Hermitian and antiHermitian part of Z, in the logical basis, Z + Z \u2020 = \u03c3 z and \u2212i(Z \u2212 Z \u2020 ) = \u2212\u03c3 y , respectively. Verifying that\nthe expectation value of these operators is zero for any link provides a simple necessary condition of the consistent realization\nof the gauge symmetry \u2013 obviously, it is saying nothing about how good is the simulation of the dynamics. In order to make\nthe check of gauge-invariance more compelling \u2013 it is well known that while the expectation value of local operators can be\nreasonably close to what craved, the state can still be orthogonal to the one desired\u2013 we may consider similar operators on\nN z(y)\nN z(y)\nlarger support such as non-intersecting string of links, l \u03c3l . The vanishing of all the h l \u03c3l i would provide a stronger\nconfirmation about the gauge invariance of the prepared state.\nIt is worth to notice that, as these measurements are destructive, i.e., they are non-commuting with the gauge-condition and\nwith the Hamiltonian, the (ground-)state of the model has to prepare again after any of these measurements.\nThe second important check is non destructive, and concerns the dynamics of gauge theories. As argued in section II C, a\ncommon mark to them is charge confinement. This can be tested by measuring the charge gap defined as the difference in energy\nbetween the ground-state with opposite \u00b11 charges and the vacuum. It requires the comparison of the ground-state energies\nin presence of \u00b11 static background charges at different distances. The vacuum may be thought as the limit configuration of\nzero displacement between the charges. As explained in section II C, the different ground-state preparation amount in changing\nthe gauge symmetry condition from (7) to (34) at the two sites where the charges are located. In presence of confinement, the\ndependence of the charge gap upon the inter-charge distance (for the model proposed) has to be linear, with the proportionality\nfactor expressing the string tension, see (36). This measurement can be performed at both stages of the ground-state preparation.\n\u221a\nIndeed, after the dissipative stage, charges should already be confined and the string tension in known to be \u03c3 = 1/ 2. The\nvalue extracted from the experiment can, then, be used to check whether the first step of the state preparation has been successful.\nAfter the implementation of the ground-state of the full Hamiltonian, for instance, via the CRAB optimization, charges should\nstill be confined but with a different and unknown value of the string tension. At present, this value cannot been determined with\nother means for sufficiently large lattices (the string tension itself is not well-defined for small lattices). Hence, it would be first\ninteresting determination of the quantum simulation.\nF.\n\nSome remarks on the experimental set-up and summary of the experimental sequence\n\nFor sake of clarity, we conclude this section by summarizing which are the key ingredients to build up the quantum simulator\nand which is the experimental schedule of the simulation.\n1.\n\nRequirements of the implementation\n\n\u2022 The first requirement for setting up the experiments is the choice of ultracold atoms suitable for the implementation of\nthe mesoscopic Rydberg gate and for the load in the appropriate optical lattice. In the simplest scenario we may consider,\n\n\f21\nensemble and control atoms are of the same atomic species, for instances Rubidium. As a consequence, an ordinary square\nlattice, obtained by shining the atoms with two pairs of counterpropagating lasers in the X and Y direction, respectively,\nis sufficient to host all the atoms. If distinct atomic species for ensemble and control are considered, a more complicated\nsuperlattice structure has to be employed, as, for separate, physical (link qubits represented by the ensemble atoms) and\nancillary (control atoms) degrees of freedom occupy two square lattices at 45 \u25e6 (see Fig. 9). In any case, the lattice\npotential has to be sufficiently high that the free hopping is suppressed (compared with the time scale of the experiment):\nfor simplicity, the atoms are assumed to be in Mott state with just one atom per site.\n\u2022 The second crucial requirement is single-site addressing, i.e., the capacity of (laser) manipulating the atom in each site\nindividually. Single-site addressing is technically hard but possible [63] in ultracold atom experiments. It is at the hearth\nof the functioning of mesoscopic Rydberg gate, see Fig. 8. Furthermore, due to single-site addressing, the position in the\nlattice is sufficient by itself to distinguish control atoms from the ensemble ones.\n\u2022 The third requirement is that the system be sufficiently cold such that the energy scale E associated to the Hamiltonian\ncan be resolved, i.e., KT < E where T is the temperature and K the Boltzmann constant. The energy scale E, roughly\nspeaking the normalization of the plaquette term (for convenient it has been fixed to 1 in our analysis), is limited by\nthe Trotter approximation to be much less than the inverse of the time \u2206t in which one unitary step of time evolution is\nperformed. Such time \u2206t is determined by the number of sequential Rydberg gates NR needed to engineer the plaquette\nterm evolution, \u2206t = NRtR , as the further delay due to single-qubit rotations entering the process is negligible compared to\nthe Rydberg gate delay tR . Hence, it follows NR \u001c tR KT . For state of the art experiments tR KT & 102 , as tR is about few \u03bcs\nand T is about few tens of nK. Let us now compute NR . The plaquette term decomposes in eight elementary monomials of\n\u03c3 \u03bc , \u03bc = 0, . . . , 3, \u03c3 0 = 1, as shown in (56). Two of them, (\u03c3 z )\u22974 and (\u03c3 y )\u22974 , are commuting when applied on contiguous\nplaquettes. The other six, (\u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 y )\u22972 , (\u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z )\u22972 , \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z , \u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 z \u2297 \u03c3 y , (\u03c3 z )\u22972 \u2297 (\u03c3 y )\u22972 , (\u03c3 y \u2297 \u03c3 z )\u22972\ncan be decomposed in twelve commuting monomials once applied on the alternated plaquettes. As the unitary evolution\nof each monomial involves two Rydberg gates, the total number of gates performed is NR = (2 + 6 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 2 = 28, which\nis sufficiently small to satisfy the condition. Performing gate optimization, NR may be further reduced.\n2.\n\nExperimental sequence\n\n1. Loading of the ultracold atoms in the appropriate square (super)lattice as in Fig. 9.\n2. Preparation of the initial appropriate product state as in section III D, by using dissipation via Rydberg gates (or dissipation\ncombined with single-site manipulation of individual ensemble atoms). As discussed in section II C, the matter content of\nthe final desired state to achieve (after the driving, see next point) determines which is the appropriate initial state to start\nwith.\n3. Adiabatic unitary evolution using Rydberg gates as explained in section III D. Commuting operations can be performed\non parallel. More efficient driving as the CRAB method can be adopted.\n4. Error minimization by enforcing the gauge condition during the driving via dissipation (see section III B). The two procedures, driving and dissipation, can be applied for alternative intervals of time.\n5. Validation of the simulator and \"computation\" of the simulation. Once the ground-state of the system (for the chosen\nmatter content) has been achieved, it is characterized by measuring correlation functions. Such operation can be performed\nby mapping the expectation value of the operator on the control atoms with the gate G\u0303, as defined in (44). Indeed,\nthe relevant operators to be evaluated are (linear combination of) monomials of \u03c3 \u03bc , Q = \u03c3 \u03bc1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3 \u03bck , both for the\nvalidation and the evaluation of the string tension. The latter requires the evaluation of the energy decomposed in the\nsum of commuting monomials with k = 4 (as explained above). In practice, one starts with the control initialized in\n|0i. Once applied the unitary map G\u0303, the control will be in the linear superposition |0i and |1i, reflecting which is the\ndecomposition of the state in eigenvalues \u00b11 of Q (see explanation below (44)). The control state can be measured in\nvarious ways, for instance using florescence [64]. Afterwards, the original state of the simulator has to be prepared again,\nas the measurement alters it. In order to get enough statistics, the whole process has to be repeated several times.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this work, we have introduced a new derivation of the U(1) gauge magnet in 2+1 dimension as a special case of a generic\nAbelian LTG, and discussed its phase diagram for a natural choice of the gauge invariant Hamiltonian. The advantage of such\nderivation is that it shows explicitly that the U(1) gauge magnet may be viewed as a truncated formulation of the standard\n\n\f22\nKogut-Susskind U(1) LGT theory. In particular, the amount of resources needed for the simulation is drastically reduced as the\nlocal Hilbert space shrinks from infinity to 2D (qubit). This allows to engineer a digital simulation of gauge magnet in optical\nlattices based on the latest developments in Rydberg gates.\nIn this context, we have proposed a protocol that allows for both preparing the ground-state of the model and performing\nits out of equilibrium dynamics. We also discuss two possible measurements that can provide sine qua no conditions to the\ncorrectness of simulation. In order to perform a successful simulation, one has at least check that the states obtained are gauge\ninvariant and that static charges are confined. The determination of the string tension for the full-fledge Hamiltonian of the U(1)\ngauge magnet would also provide the first non-trivial result obtained from a quantum simulator in the area of gauge theories.\nOur results pose interesting questions and open novel possibilities that deserve further studies. First of all, we (re)discover that\nthe simplest plaquette Hamiltonian gives rise to confined phase, as expected, but gapless. Such property distinguishes the gauge\nmagnets from the ordinary U(1) gauge theory in 2+1 (cf. [52]), and it is a consequence of novel gauge condition arising from the\ndifferent choice of the Hilbert space (such choice, for instance, rules out the existence of short closed-string configurations). How\nthe choice of the group representation affects universal properties like phase diagrams and phase transitions is a fundamental\nquestion that raises naturally here and is asking for solutions.\nSimilarly, our constructive approach to gauge magnets allows an infinite class of Hamiltonians built up of local terms to be\nconsidered. It is totally unknown, at the moment, whether novel phases and phase transitions are described by such models, and,\nfor instance, whether the Polyakov phase could coexist in the same phase diagram with the gapless phase we have encountered\nin our study. The above questions are especially stimulating as nowadays novel tools in both classical simulation algorithms and\nin quantum simulation may be designed and employed to find a solution.\nFurthermore, another interesting line of investigation is the search for analogues of the gauge magnets formulations in 3+1\ndimensions and/or for non-Abelian groups. In parallel, the introduction of the coupling to charged matter is very appealing. As\nrelativistic fermions are relatively easy to be simulated analogically in optical lattices, a combined digital/analogic simulation\napproach is desirable.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe idea of using quantum links for the quantum simulation of dynamical gauge theories originated at KITP, from discussions\nof ML with U.J.Wiese, whom we kindly thank.

Little after the appearance of this work, [65] appeared proposing a different way of simulating link model in\noptical lattices.\nAppendix A: Gauge group Z2 .\n1.\n\nThe local Hilbert space\n\nThe Z2 is the simplest LGT one could imagine (apart from the percolationg LGT of [66]) where the orientation of the lattice\nis not important, since there are only two different elements of the group, the first is 1 and the other is e, which has the property\nthat e2 = ee\u22121 = 1. The local Hilbert space with spin 1/2 is the algebra of the group and the representation matrices of the group\ncoincide with the regular representation of the group. The regular representation is defined to be the representation in which the\nmatrices are constructed directly from the multiplication table of the group. In order to get the representation of multiplication\nby a given element, one substitute the given element in the multiplication with one and all the others with zeros. For the Z2 case\nwe have the following group multiplication table\n1 e\n1\n1 e\ne\u22121 = e e 1\n\n(A1)\n\nthus X(1) = 1, X(e) = \u03c3x . There is an important theorem relating the regular representation with the irreducible representations.\nThis theorem states that the regular representation contains all the irreducible representations a number of time equal to their\ndimensions [48].\nIn this case, we have two As (g), As (1) = 1 and As (e) = \u03c3x\u22974 . Thus the condition (9) is projecting out half of the 24 states\nassociated to a site.\n\n\f23\n2.\n\nThe gauge invariant Hilbert space\n\nIn order to show that the condition (9) is neither trivial or empty, and how it can be implemented, we first consider the minimal\nlattice, made of only one plaquette. This is shown explicitly in Fig. 11 v). The gauge invariant Hilbert space is embedded in the\n24 = 16 dimensional Hilbert space {|l1 l2 l3 l4 i}. Due to the periodic identification of of the links on the plaquette, (9) applied for\ns1 implies\n\u03c3xl4 \u2297 \u03c3xl1 |l1 l4 i = |l1 l4 i.\n\n(A2)\n\nSince \u03c3x has eigenvalues \u00b11. We have two possibilities |l1 l4 i = |++i, |l1 l4 i = |\u2212\u2212i, where\n\u03c3x |+i = |+i, \u03c3x |\u2212i = \u2212|\u2212i.\n\n(A3)\n\nBy iteratively applying all the As (g) on subsequent sites, one realizes that there are two allowed states and thus a generic gauge\ninvariant state is a linear combination of them\n|\u03c6+ i = |+ + ++i, |\u03c6\u2212 i = |\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i.\n\n(A4)\n\nThis formalize the naive intuition (which has to be modified for finite systems with periodic boundary conditions [18]) that gauge\ninvariant states are related to the elementary plaquettes of the lattice.\n3.\n\nThe gauge invariant operators\n\nThe operators compatible with gauge invariance constraints are either\n\u2022 product of \u03c3x on arbitrary links of the lattice\n\u2022 product of \u03c3i6=x on closed paths\nl\n\nThe simplest choice is then \u03c3zl1 \u2297 \u03c3zl2 \u2297 \u03c3z3 \u2297 \u03c3zl4 . Going back to the lattice formed by a single plaquette of Fig. 11 v) we define\nthe Hamiltonian\nH0 = \u2212BP = \u2212\u03c3zl1 \u2297 \u03c3zl2 \u2297 \u03c3zl3 \u2297 \u03c3zl4 ,\n\n(A5)\n\nthat is the form that the generic Hamiltonian of (18) on the chosen lattice when \u03b8 = 0. In this simple example, we see that the\nground-state is given by the linear combination\n1\nB\n|\u03c80 p i = \u221a (|+ + ++i + |\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i) ,\n2\n\n(A6)\n\nand the first excitation is given by\n1\nB\n|\u03c81 p i = \u221a (|+ + ++i \u2212 |\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i) .\n2\nWe also see that the two states are separated by an energy gap (that does not depend on the system size),\n\u22062 = 2.\n\n(A7)\n\n(A8)\n\nOn the other hand, if we consider the opposit limit of the Hamiltonian of (18) and set \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, we obtain\nH\u03c0/2 = \u2212 \u2211 \u03c3xli ),\n\n(A9)\n\nli\n\nwhich ground-state becomes\n|\u03c80\u03c3x i = |+ + ++i,\n\n(A10)\n\n|\u03c81\u03c3x i = |\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i.\n\n(A11)\n\nand which first excited state is\nAlready in this simple example we can appreciate that in the two limit considered of (18) we are in a gaped phase but the\nground-states of the Hamiltonian in (A9) and (A5) have different entanglement properties. Indeed, the ground-state of the latter\nHamiltonian is a product state, while the one of the former is locally maximally entangled, since the reduced density matrix of\na single link is proportional to the identity. This reasoning can be extended to larger systems since both Hamiltonians of (A9)\nand (A5) are fixed point of the RG flow [18]. The general Hamiltonian (18) is not in general a fixed point of the RG flow. From\nthe above discussion it is easy to accept the appearence of a phase transition at a given \u03b8c in between \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 that\nseparate the domain of attraction of the RG fixed point at \u03b8 = 0 usually called the topological-deconfined phase with the one of\nthe RG fixed point at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 usually called the confined phase.\n\n\f24\nAppendix B: The case of the group Z3 , prototype for the generic ZN\n\nFigure 11: i) Example of an oriented lattice L with L sites s and N = 2L links l. ii) A many-body state of the lattice is obtained by defining\na local Hilbert space V on each of the links. A state of the lattice is then a state of the tensor product |\u03c8i \u2208 HG = V \u2297N . iii) For each site\ns of the lattice we can define operators As (g) acting on the local Hilbert space HG |s = V \u22974 , where V is the Hilbert space of a link ending\nin s. As (g) multiplies each link state |hli is for the X(g) N\nor X(g\u22121 ) depending\non the fact if the link is entering or exiting the particular site.\nN\nGauge invariance is the requirement that the state As (g) i |hli is i = i |hli is ii.iv) A particular case is obtained when the local Hilbert space\nV is chosen to be the group algebra C (G). In this case, the states are labeled by |gli is and changing the orientation of the link, corresponds to\n|hli is \u2192 |h\u22121 li is . v) A simple example of a one plaquette lattice, discussed in the main text, is worked out in details. It consists of four sites,\ns1 * * * s4 and four links l1 * * * l4 . The four elementary gauge transformations related to the four sites are explicitly introduced.\n\nThe next step of complication is obtained by considering a Z3 . The main difference with respect to the Z2 theory is that the\ngroup algebra of Z3 has dimension 3 - N for a generic ZN - and not all the elements of the group are the inverse of themselves.\nHence, the orientation of the lattice plays a central role. From now on, we will consider two different basis, the group algebra\nbasis |gi, and the basis in which the regular representation becomes the direct sum of the irreducible representations |ti.\nIn the |gi-basis the X(g)s read\n1 e2 = e\u22121\ne1 = e\u22121\n1\n2\n1 1\ne2\ne1\n,\ne1 e1\n1\ne2\ne2 e2\ne1\n1\n\n(B1)\n\n\f25\nX(1) = 1 ,\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nX(e1 ) = \uf8ed 1\n0\n\uf8eb\n0\nX(e2 ) = \uf8ed 0\n1\n\n(B2)\n\uf8f6\n\n0 1\n0 0 \uf8f8,\n1 0\n\uf8f6\n1 0\n0 1 \uf8f8.\n0 0\n\n(B3)\n\n(B4)\n\nAs done previously for \u03c3x , we can diagonalize all the X and we pass to the basis |ti ihti |, i = 1 . . . 3. In this basis\nX(1) = diag{1, 1, 1},\nX(e1 ) = diag{1, e\nX(e2 ) = diag{1, e\n\n4\u03c0 i\n3\n2\u03c0 i\n3\n\n(B5)\n\n,e\n\n2\u03c0 i\n3\n\n},\n\n(B6)\n\n,e\n\n4\u03c0 i\n3\n\n}.\n\n(B7)\n\nWe then can find the gauge invariant states in the |ti-basis\n|t1,t1 ,t1 ,t1 i, |t2 ,t2 ,t2 ,t2 i, |t3 ,t3 ,t3 ,t3 i.\n\n(B8)\n\nNow, let us focus on the construction of the plaquette of the Hamiltonian, taking properly in account the orientation of the\nlinks. In order to do so, we have to specify the form of the Z operator for the group Z3 , which generalizes the \u03c3z employed for\nZ2 . In the |gi-basis, it is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0\n0\n2\u03c0i\n0 \uf8f8.\n(B9)\nZ=\uf8ed 0 e 3\n4\u03c0 i\n0 0 e3\nIt has the following properties\nZX(e1 ) = e\n\n2\u03c0 i\n3\n\nX(e1 )Z, ZX(e2 ) = e\n\n4\u03c0 i\n3\n\nX(e2 )Z.\n\n(B10)\n\nIf we orient the plaquettes in such a way that they always have one entering and one exiting link for each site (either anticlockwise or clockwise) the plaquette will meet a gauge transformation on two consecutive links but the orientation is such that\nthe gauge transformation on these links will look like X(e) \u2297 X(e\u22121 ) . Since the orientation of the plaquette is different from\nthe orientation of the gauge transformation given in Fig. 11 iii) we are multiplying one of the two links for X(e\u22121 ) instead than\nX(e). Hence, the only possibility to obtain an operator commuting with all the gauge transformations is to take again a product\nof Z as\n[Z \u2297 Z, X(e) \u2297 X(e\u22121 )] = 0,\n\n(B11)\n\naccordingly to (B10). It follows that the correspondent Hamiltonian term, written on the anti-clockwise or clockwise oriented\nplaquettes (as the one of Fig. 11 v) ), reads\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n(B12)\nHP = \u2212 \u2211 Zl1 Zl2 Zl3 Zl4 + Zl\u20201 Zl\u20202 Zl\u20203 Zl\u20204 .\n2 p\nThis is, as expected, the explicit realization of Hamiltonian of (18) with \u03b8 = 0 for the group Z3 . It is important to notice that\nnow the l1 * * * l4 are the links around a given plaquette in the order of Fig. 11 v). Once we move back to the standard orientation\nof the 2D space of Fig. 11 ii) we recover the standard form [47]\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nHP = \u2212 \u2211 Zl\u20201 Zl\u20202 Zl3 Zl4 + Zl1 Zl2 Zl\u20203 Zl\u20204 .\n(B13)\n2 p\nOnce the basis is rotated from |gi to |ti, the form of the Z operator is determined by (B10) to be\nZ : |ti i \u2192 |ti+1 i,\n\n(B14)\n\nZ \u2020 : |ti i \u2192 |ti \u2212 1i,\n\n(B15)\n\nand\n\n\f26\ni.e., X(e1 ) \u2192 Z, and Z \u2192 X(e1 ).\nAgain we can consider the ground-state of the plaquette operator for a lattice made of a single plaquette as in Fig. 11 v). It\nturns out that\nZl1 Zl2 Zl3 Zl4 : |titititi i \u2192 |ti+1ti+1ti+1ti+1 i,\n\n(B16)\n\nZl\u20201 Zl\u20202 Zl\u20203 Zl\u20204\n\n(B17)\n\n: |titititi i \u2192 |ti\u22121ti\u22121ti\u22121ti\u22121 i.\n\nIt is easy to realize that the eigenvalues of HP are \u22121 or +1/2 and its ground-state on a single plaquette is given by\n1\n|\u03c80 i = \u221a \u2211 |titititi i.\n3 i\n\n(B18)\n\nHere, again we discover the emergence of gauge invariant plaquette states. Their number is now 3 and clearly coincide with the\n|G|, the cardinality of the group. The plaquette Hamiltonian is still gapped, but the gap, \u22063 = 3/2 is now smaller than in the Z2\ncase. We can again study the opposite limit of (18) with \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. There we see that all spins are aligned in the t1 direction.\nAs before, by passing to larger lattices, we can repeat the same reasoning and we find two different phases. One in which the\nground-state in a product state and the other in which it is robustly entangled. It is also known that by increasing the rank of the\ngroup a third phase appear. Here, we will not study that phase and refer the interested reader to the literature [67].\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n\nC.

Apparently this is suggesting\nthat also a choice of an \u03b1g commensurable with \u03c0, for instance \u03b1g = 41 \u03c0, is providing locally right gauge condition.\nJ. Barreiro, M. Muller, P.
