The general properties (e.g., activity class, star formation rates, metallicities, extinctions, average ages, etc) of luminous and\nultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively) in the local universe are well known since large samples of these\nobjects have been the subject of numerous spectroscopic works over the last three decades. There are, however, relatively few studies\nof the spatially-resolved spectroscopic properties of large samples of LIRGs and ULIRGs using integral field spectroscopy (IFS).\nAims. We are carrying out an IFS survey of local (z < 0.26) samples of LIRGs and ULIRGs to characterize their two-dimensional\nspectroscopic properties. The main goal of this paper is to study the spatially resolved properties of the stellar populations and the\nexcitation conditions in a sample of LIRGs.\nMethods. We analyze optical (3800-7200\u00c5) IFS data taken with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS) of the\ncentral few kiloparsecs of eleven LIRGs. To study the stellar populations we fit the optical stellar continuum and the hydrogen\nrecombination lines of selected regions in the galaxies. We analyze the excitation conditions of the gas using the spatially resolved\nproperties of the brightest optical emission lines. We complemented the PMAS observations with existing HST/NICMOS near-infrared\ncontinuum and Pa\u03b1 imaging.\nResults. The optical continua of selected regions in our LIRGs are well fitted with a combination of an evolved (\u223c 0.7\u221210 Gyr) stellar\npopulation with an ionizing stellar population (1 \u2212 20 Myr). The latter population is more obscured than the evolved population, and\nhas visual extinctions in good agreement with those obtained from the Balmer decrement. Except for NGC 7771, we found no clear\nevidence for an important contribution to the optical light from an intermediate-aged stellar population (\u223c 100 \u2212 500 Myr). Even after\ncorrecting for the presence of stellar absorption, a large fraction of spaxels with low observed equivalent widths of H\u03b1 in emission\nstill show enhanced [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 and [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 ratios. These ratios are likely to be produced by a combination of\nphotoionization in H ii regions and diffuse emission. These regions of enhanced line ratios are generally coincident with low surface\nbrightness H ii regions and diffuse emission detected in the H\u03b1 and Pa\u03b1 images. Using the PMAS spatially resolved line ratios and\nthe NICMOS Pa\u03b1 photometry of H ii regions we find that the fraction of diffuse emission in LIRGs varies from galaxy to galaxy, and\nit is generally less than 60% as found in other starburst galaxies.\nKey words. galaxies: evolution - galaxies: nuclei - galaxies: star formation - galaxies: structure - infrared: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nLuminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs and\nULIRGs, respectively) with infrared 8 \u2212 1000 \u03bcm luminosities\nLIR = 1011 \u2212 1012 L\u2299 and LIR = 1012 \u2212 1013 L\u2299 , respectively (see\nSanders & Mirabel 1996) are among the most luminous objects\nin the local universe, and are believed to be powered by strong\nstar formation and/or AGN activity. The main properties of local\nLIRGs and ULIRGs are well known since these two classes of\ngalaxies have been extensively studied using imaging and spectroscopy over the last three decades. These properties include,\namong others, morphologies (e.g., Veilleux, Kim, & Sanders\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the German-Spanish\nAstronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the MaxPlanck-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie Heidelberg and the Instituto de\nAstrof\u0131\u0301sica de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (CSIC).\n\n2002; Sanders & Ishida 2004; Scoville et al. 2000; Bushouse\net al. 2002; Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006), the nuclear activity class, star formation rates, and extinctions (e.g., Heckman,\nArmus, & Miley 1987; Armus, Heckman, & Miley 1989; Kim\net al. 1995, 1998; Veilleux et al. 1995, 1999; Goldader et\nal. 1995; Wu et al. 1998; Rigopoulou et al. 1999; Heckman\net al. 2000; Yuan, Kewley, & Sanders 2010), stellar populations (e.g., Poggianti & Wu 2000; Chen et al. 2009; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez\nZaur\u0131\u0301n, Tadhunter, & Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado 2009, 2010a), metallicities (e.g., Rupke, Veilleux & Baker 2008), and molecular gas\ncontent (e.g., Sanders et al. 1991; Gao & Solomon 2004; Graci\u00e1Carpio et al. 2006, 2008).\nThere are, however, relatively few studies of the spatiallyresolved spectroscopic properties of LIRGs and ULIRGs using integral field spectroscopy (IFS).

IFS instruments working in the optical and infrared spectral ranges on 4 and 8 m-class telescopes\nare now ubiquitous, and thus this situation is changing rapidly.\nOur group is involved in an ambitious project intended to characterize the detailed optical and infrared spectroscopic properties\nof local samples of LIRGs and ULIRGs using a variety of IFS\nfacilities.\nThis is the second paper in a series presenting observations with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer\n(PMAS, Roth et al. 2005) of the northern portion of a sample of local LIRGs defined by Alonso-Herrero et al. (2006).\nThe PMAS sample is in turn part of the larger IFS survey\nof nearby (z < 0.26) LIRGs and ULIRGs in the northern\nand the southern hemispheres using different IFS instruments.\nThe optical ones include, apart from the PMAS instrument, the\nVIMOS instrument (Le F\u00e8vre et al. 2003) on the VLT, and the\nINTEGRAL+WYFFOS system (Arribas et al. 1998; Bingham\net al. 1994) on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT).

(2009a,b) for the INTEGRAL results of\nULIRGs, and Arribas et al. (2008), Monreal-Ibero et al. (2010a)\nand Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. (2010b) for the VIMOS results.\nAdditionally, Pereira-Santaella et al. (2010) studied the spatially\nresolved mid-infrared properties of LIRGs using the spectral\nmapping capability of IRS on Spitzer, and Bedregal et al. (2009)\npresented a detailed near-IR IFS study of a local LIRG using\nSINFONI on the VLT.\nIn this paper we study in detail the stellar populations, excitation conditions, and diffuse emission in the central regions\n(a few kiloparsecs) of a sample of 11 LIRGs using the PMAS\ndata. The paper is organized as follows. We present the observations and data analysis in Section 2. In Section 3 we describe\nthe modelling of the stellar populations. The results regarding\nthe morphology, stellar populations, excitation conditions, and\ndiffuse emission are presented in Sections 4, 5, and 6. We give\nour conclusions in Section 7.\n\n2. Observations and Data Analysis\n2.1. Sample, observations and Data Reduction\n\nThe observations and data reduction of the PMAS data are described in detail in Paper I. Briefly, we used PMAS on the\n\n3.5 m telescope at the German-Spanish Observatory of Calar\nAlto (Spain) to observe a sample of 11 local LIRGs. These\ncomprise the majority of the northern hemisphere portion of the\nvolume-limited (v = 2750 \u2212 5200 km s\u22121 ) sample of LIRGs of\nAlonso-Herrero et al. (2006). This volume-limited sample was\noriginally drawn from the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample\n(RBGS, Sanders et al. 2003). The range of IR luminosities of the\nPMAS sample is log(LIR /L\u2299 ) = 11.05 \u2212 11.59, and the galaxies\nare at an average distance of 61 Mpc (for the assumed cosmology H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). As the sample is flux-limited, it\nis composed mostly by moderate IR luminosity systems, with\nan average log(LIR /L\u2299 ) = 11.32 for the full sample of AlonsoHerrero et al. (2006).\nThe PMAS observations were taken with the Lens Array\nMode configuration, which is made of a 16 \u00d7 16 array of microlenses coupled with fibers called hereafter spaxels. We used\nthe 1\u2032\u2032 magnification that provides a field of view (FoV) of\n16\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 16\u2032\u2032 . All the galaxies were observed with a single pointing, except NGC 7771 for which we obtained two pointings to\nconstruct a mosaic with a 28\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 16\u2032\u2032 FoV. We covered the wavelength range of 3800 \u2212 7200 \u00c5, using the V300 grating with a\nspectral resolution of 6.8 \u00c5 full width half maximum (FWHM).\nThe full description of the data reduction procedure can be found\nin Paper I.\nIn addition to the PMAS data, in this paper we make use\nof the HST/NICMOS F110W (\u03bbc = 1.1 \u03bcm) and F160W (\u03bbc =\n1.6 \u03bcm) continuum observations to construct continuum near-IR\ncolor maps, as discussed by Alonso-Herrero et al. (2006). The\nonly additional step needed for the reduced NICMOS images\nwas to rotate and trim them to match the orientation and FoV,\nrespectively, of the PMAS images.\nTable 2.

PMAS spatially resolved emission line ratios and\nequivalent widths\n\n2.3. Extraction and Analysis of the 1D spectra of selected\nregions\n\nWe constructed spectral maps of the brightest emission lines\nin an automated fashion using our own IDL routines as\nwell as the IDL-based MPFITEXPR algorithm1 the lines to\nGaussian functions and the adjacent continuum to a straight\nline, on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis, as described in more detail\nPaper I. These fits provided the flux, equivalent width (EW),\nand full width half maximum of the emission lines. In this\npaper, we generated spectral maps of the following optical\nline ratios: [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2, [O i]\u03bb6300/H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1, and\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1. We also generated maps of the EW of\nthe H\u03b1 line in emission (EW(H\u03b1)em ), which are thus measured\nas positive numbers. The maps of the line ratios and EW are\nnot corrected for the presence of H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 in absorption. The\nspectral maps of the observed line ratios together with those of\nthe observed flux of H\u03b1 and EW(H\u03b1)em are shown in Figure 1,\nexcept for IC 860, for which the line emission is compact (see\nPaper I). In Table 1 we list for each of the emission line ratios\nthe number of spaxels where it was possible to obtain a measurement, the median, the average value and the standard deviation,\nfor each galaxy and the full PMAS sample.\n\nFor each galaxy we extracted the nuclear and integrated spectra as done in Paper I. Briefly, we identified the position of\nthe optical nucleus as the peak of the 6200 \u00c5 continuum emission, and extracted the nuclear spectrum using the corresponding\nspaxel. The physical size covered by the nuclear spectrum for\neach galaxy was given in Paper I, and it is typically the approximate central 300 pc. The integrated spectrum of each galaxy was\nextracted by defining \u223c 6200 \u00c5 continuum isophotes and then\nsumming up all the spaxels contained within the chosen external\ncontinuum isophote to include as much as possible of the PMAS\nFoV. The area covered by the integrated spectrum can be seen\nin figure 1 in Paper I, and it is generally the central 5 \u2212 8 kpc,\ndepending on the galaxy.\n\nWe also produced standard optical diagnostic diagrams using the brightest emission lines (Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich\n1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987) on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis for the galaxies in our sample. These diagrams provide useful information on the excitation conditions of different regions\nin galaxies, such as, photoionization by young stars, shocks,\nand AGN photoionization. In Paper I we presented such diagrams for the nuclear and integrated measurements of our sample. The spatially-resolved diagnostic diagrams for each of the\ngalaxies in our sample are shown in Figure 2. We also produced\n[N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 vs. [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 diagrams (Figure 3)\nfor each of the galaxies in our sample. These diagrams have an\nadvantage over the Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987) diagrams in\nthat they contain more data points, as the [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 line ratio can be strongly affected by both the presence of an underlying\nstellar absorption and extinction. As we shall see in Sections 5\nand 6, the effects of the Balmer absorption stellar features on the\nobserved line ratios are not negligible in regions with low values of EW(H\u03b1)em or EW(H\u03b2)em . For this reason, the individual\nmeasurements in diagrams of Figures 2 and 3 are color-coded\naccording to arbitrarily chosen ranges of EW(H\u03b1)em . All these\ndiagrams and the effects of the correction for stellar absorption\nfeatures will be discussed in Section 6.\nThe errors of the line ratios depend on the observed values of EW(H\u03b1)em and the S/N of the spectra. We estimated the\ntypical uncertainties by comparing the line ratios measured automatically with our IDL routines with those fitted manually\nwith the splot routine within IRAF for selected spaxels in each\ngalaxy. For each galaxy, the comparison was made for spaxels\nwithin the smallest observed range of EW(H\u03b1)em where the uncertainties are the highest. By choosing spaxels with low values of EW(H\u03b1)em , we basically estimated an upper limit to the\nuncertainties of the observed line ratios. As can be seen from\nFigure 3 the largest uncertainties in the [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 and\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 ratios are 10 \u2212 25%, and 15 \u2212 40%, respectively, depending on the range of EW(H\u03b1)em and the galaxy.\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.purl.com/net/mpfit developed by Markwardt (2008).\nWe fitted\n\nFor the three galaxies observed under photometric conditions: NGC 23, NGC 2388, and NGC 7771, we extracted spectra\nof a number of bright H ii regions. The locations of the selected\nregions are shown in the lower panels of Figure 4. These regions\nwere chosen to probe, for each galaxy, a range of EW(H\u03b1)em\nand continuum slopes as can be seen from Figure 5. Veilleux\net al. (1995) found that the extinction in (U)LIRGs powered by\nstar formation is correlated with the shape of the optical continuum. We estimated the shape of the optical continuum by measuring the ratio (C6500 /C4800 ) between the continuum fluxes (see\nFigure 4) near H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 at 4800 and 6500 \u00c5, respectively. The\ndefinition of this ratio is given in Table 2. Similarly the gas extinctions are related to the HST/NICMOS F160W \u2212 F110W colors (see Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006). Figure 4 shows how the\nselected H ii regions in these galaxies span a range in F160W to\nF110W flux ratios, and there is a good correspondence between\nred near-IR colors and steep optical continua. Table 3 gives details of the observed properties of these regions. Given the good\nquality of the spectra for these three galaxies, we will use them to\ndo a detailed modelling of the stellar populations in these galaxies (Section 3.1).\nAs we will explain in Section 5.1, we can use the 4000\u00c5break and the Balmer lines in absorption, and in particular the\nH\u03b4 line, to infer an estimate of the average age of the stellar\npopulations. Although the H\u03b4 nebular emission line is much\nweaker than H\u03b1 and H\u03b2, it can also be observed in emission\nin bright/young H ii regions (see for instance the HII-1 region in\nNGC 23, Figures 4 and 5). To minimize the contamination from\nthe Balmer lines in emission, for each galaxy we selected regions\nwith low values of EW(H\u03b1)em so we could attempt to measure\nthe H\u03b4 feature in absorption. We produced the average spectrum\nof this low EW emission by summing up the spaxels with the\nspecified range of EW(H\u03b1)em for each galaxy. The individual\nspaxels had typically 20 \u00c5 < EW(H\u03b1)em < 6 \u00c5, but the specific\nrange depended on the galaxy and the S/N of the data. From\nthe comparison between the maps of the observed EW(H\u03b1)em in\nFigure 1 and the HST/NICMOS Pa\u03b1 maps shown in Paper I, it\nis clear that the low EW(H\u03b1)em values are associated with regions of diffuse emission or low surface brightness H ii regions.\nTable 4 lists the values of EW(H\u03b1)em as measured from the average spectrum of regions of low EW of H\u03b1 of each galaxy. All the\nextracted spectra were shifted to rest-frame wavelengths prior to\nthe analysis and fitting the stellar populations.\nIn Section 5 we will study the stellar populations of LIRGs\nusing the 4000 \u00c5-break and the H\u03b4 stellar feature.

The orange dots are the spaxels used to produce the average spectrum of regions with relatively low EW of H\u03b1\n(see Section 2.3). For NGC 7771 we additionally extracted a spectrum of the possible location of the true nucleus (shown as a black\ndot), based on the H\u03b1 velocity field (see Paper I for details).\nthat of Worthey & Ottaviani (1997) for the H\u03b4A index.2 We measured these indices for the nuclear and integrated spectra, as well\nas the average spectra of regions of low EW(H\u03b1)em . The pseudocontinuum bands of these two indices, as well as the line window\nfor the H\u03b4A index are listed in Table 2. For the majority of the\nselected H ii regions (see Table 3), as well as the nuclei and integrated emission (Table 4), the measured values H\u03b4A are only\nlower limits as the observed values of EW(H\u03b1)em in emission\n2\n\nWe note that the value of this index is positive for absorption, and\nthroughout this paper we will use this symbol to indicate the feature in\nabsorption.\n\nimply a contribution from nebular H\u03b4 emission to the index.

This is also apparent for\nthe H ii regions in our sample of LIRGs, including those with\nthe largest EW(H\u03b1)em (see Figure 5). These strong absorption\nstellar features appear to be a general property of local LIRGs\nand ULIRGs (see e.g., Armus et al. 1989; Veilleux et al. 1995;\nKim et al. 1995, 1998; Marcillac et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2009;\nRodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. 2009), as well as intermediate-redshift\nLIRGs (see e.g., Hammer et al. 2005; Marcillac et al. 2006;\nCaputi et al. 2008). Moreover, it has been suggested that LIRGs\nrepresent phases in the life of galaxies with episodic and extremely efficient star formation (Hammer et al. 2005). This suggests that using one single stellar population (SSP) may not be\nappropriate for modelling individual regions and the integrated\nemission of LIRGs.\n3.1. Modelling of the stellar continuum\n\nFor the modelling of the stellar continuum we used the Bruzual\n& Charlot (2003, BC03 hereafter) models with solar metallicity,\ninstantaneous star formation, and a Salpeter (Salpeter 1955) initial mass function (IMF) with lower and upper mass cutoffs of\nml = 0.1 M\u2299 and mu = 100 M\u2299, respectively. These models have\na spectral resolution of 3 \u00c5 across the whole wavelength range\nfrom 3200 to 9500 \u00c5. Using these assumptions we generated\ntemplate spectra covering ages of between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr.\nThe outputs of these models are normalized to a total mass of\n1 M\u2299 formed in the burst of star formation. The dust attenuation was modelled using the Calzetti et al. (2000) extinction law,\nwhich is appropriate for starburst galaxies.\nTo fit the optical spectra of the selected regions (see\nSection 2.3) we used the CONFIT code (Robinson et al. 2000),\nwhich assumes two stellar populations plus a power law in some\ncases. Briefly, CONFIT fits the continuum shape of the extracted spectra using a minimum \u03c72 technique. For each spectrum, CONFIT measures the flux in \u223c 50 \u2212 70 wavelength bins,\nchosen to be as evenly distributed in wavelength as possible, and\nto avoid strong emission lines and atmospheric absorption features (see Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. 2009 for details). The relative\nflux calibration error of 10% measured was assumed during the\nmodelling.\nFor this work we used a large number of combinations of two\nstellar populations to determine which stellar populations dom-\n\ninate the optical emission of our galaxies. We divided the two\nstellar populations into an ionizing stellar population (< 20 Myr,\nin intervals of 1, 2, ... 10, 20 Myr) with a varying reddening\n(E(B \u2212 V)young \u2264 2.0 in increasing steps of 0.1) and an evolved\nstellar population with ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr (100,\n300, 500, 700 Myr; 1, 2, ... 5 Gyr and 10 Gyr) with moderate reddening (E(B \u2212 V)evolved = 0, 0.2, 0.4). This preferential\ndust extinction is based on the scenario where the youngest stellar populations are still partially embedded in their dusty birth\nplaces, whereas the more evolved stellar populations have already moved away from their natal clouds (Calzetti et al. 1994).\nPoggianti & Wu (2000) demonstrated that this scenario was\ncompatible with the observed optical spectra of infrared bright\ngalaxies.\nThe choice of an ionizing population is driven by the fact that\nall the spectra modelled in this paper show H\u03b1 in emission with\nEW(H\u03b1)em > 7 \u00c5 (except for the nuclear region of IC 860, see\nTables 3 and 4), which sets an upper limit to the age of approximately 10\u221220 Myr for an instantaneous burst (see e.g., Leitherer\net al. 1999 and below). We did not include very old stellar populations (> 10 Gyr) because these do not appear to have a strong\ncontribution to the optical light of local LIRGs and ULIRGs\n(see e.g., Chen et al. 2009; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. 2009). We\nassumed that both stellar populations were formed in instantaneous bursts, which seems an appropriate assumption since the\nphysical scales of the selected regions are a few hundred parsecs\n(see Table 3) and contain, at most, a few H ii regions, as shown\nin Paper I.\nA priori, fits with \u03c72red \u2264 1.0 should be considered acceptable fits to the overall shape of the continuum (see discussion\nin Tadhunter et al. 2005). However, the absolute value of \u03c72red is\nstrongly dependent on the estimated errors. We found that combinations with \u03c72red > 0.2 produced poor fits to the overall shape\nof the continuum. Moreover, for most regions we found acceptable solutions for \u03c72red < 2 \u00d7 \u03c72min , where \u03c72min was the minimum\nvalue of \u03c72red for a given region. Out of these solutions, we selected the best fitting models based on a visual inspection of\nthe fits to those absorption features with relatively little emission line contamination. These include high order Balmer lines,\nthe CaII K \u03bb3934 line, the G-band \u03bb4305, and the MgIb \u03bb5173\nband. Finally, we rejected solutions with ages of the young ionizing stellar populations older than the upper limits (that is, before\nsubtracting the stellar continuum produced by the evolved stars)\nset by the EW(H\u03b1)em values (see Section 3.2).\n\n\f6\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\n3.2. Modelling of the hydrogen recombination emission lines\n\nTo model the properties of the hydrogen recombination emission lines, we used the Starburst99 model (Leitherer et al. 1999)\nwith the same IMF and metallicity assumptions as above to generate the time evolution of EW(H\u03b1)em (and also for H\u03b2) for an\ninstantaneous burst of star formation. This model is better qualified for the modelling of populations containing hot massive\nstars (see V\u00e1zquez & Leitherer 2005 for details). The EW of the\nH\u03b1 emission line resulting from subtracting the modelled continuum arising from the non-ionizing stellar population from the\nobserved spectra can be used to put further constraints on the\nage (tneb ) of the ionizing stellar populations. Additionally, we\nused the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 emission line ratio measured after subtracting\nthe stellar continuum (from both the ionizing and non-ionizing\nstellar populations) to provide an independent estimate of the extinction to the gas (E(B-V)neb ). This gas is ionized by the young\nstellar population assumed in the previous section.\n\n4. The maps of the EW(H\u03b1)em and optical line ratios\nThe maps of EW(H\u03b1)em for our sample of LIRGs, covering on\naverage the central \u223c 4.7 kpc are shown in Figure 1. The map\nof NGC 7771 covers the central \u223c 7.7 kpc \u00d7 4.4 kpc. To first order the EW of the nebular Balmer emission lines can be used as\nindicators of the age of the ionizing stellar populations. The values of EW(H\u03b1)em in our sample of LIRGs (see Figure 1), except\nfor the nuclear region of IC 860 (Table 4), indicate ages of the\nyoung stellar populations of between 5 and \u223c 10 \u2212 20 Myr (see\ne.g., Leitherer et al. 1999, and Section 3.1). For the majority of\nthe LIRGs in this sample, as well as for our VLT/VIMOS LIRGs\nof Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. (2010b), the largest values of the EW\nof H\u03b1 are not coincident with the peak of the optical continuum\n(the nucleus). However, it is important to note that the EW of the\nBalmer nebular emission lines are also sensitive to the mass of\nthe underlying non-ionizing population. In this sense, the EW of\nthe Balmer emission lines also provide an estimate of the ratio of\nthe current star formation rate compared with the averaged past\nstar formation, that is, the burst strength (see e.g., Kennicutt et\nal. 1987; Alonso-Herrero et al. 1996), whether this refers to the\nintegrated emission of a galaxy or to individual regions within\ngalaxies. In cases of small burst strengths, the observed values\nof the EW only provide upper limits to the age of the current\nstar formation burst. Thus, the most likely explanation for the\nsmaller nuclear EW(H\u03b1)em , when compared to those of circumnuclear H ii regions observed in some galaxies, is a larger contribution from the underlying (more evolved) stellar population\n(see Kennicutt et al. 1989) and/or a slightly more evolved stellar\npopulation.\nThe regions with the largest EW(H\u03b1)em show values of\nthe [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 and [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 line ratios (see\nFigure 1) typical of H ii regions in normal star-forming galaxies. In contrast, most nuclear regions in our LIRGs tend to\nshow slightly larger lines ratios than the H ii regions of the\nsame galaxy. This is clearly seen in the diagnostic diagrams of\nFigure 2 where for each galaxy we plot the spatially resolved (on\na spaxel by spaxel basis) line ratios as a function of the observed\nvalue of EW(H\u03b1)em in emission. This is in line with findings for\nthe nuclei and H ii regions in normal star forming galaxies (see\ne.g., Kennicutt et al. 1989). We note, however, that the line ratios\nof regions with low EW(H\u03b1)em will have the largest corrections\nfor the presence of stellar Balmer absorption lines as we shall\nsee in Section 6.2.\n\nFig. 5. PMAS spectra of selected regions (see Figure 3 and\nTable 3), arbitrarily scaled, of the three galaxies observed under\nphotometric conditions: NGC 23, NGC 2388, and NGC 7771.\nThe color used for plotting the spectra corresponds to those of\nFigure 4 (lower panel).\n\n\fAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\n7\n\nFig. 6. Dn (4000) vs. H\u03b4A diagram. The small symbols are the\nmeasurements from the average spectrum of the regions with\nlow EW(H\u03b1)em of each LIRG, whereas the large symbols are\nthe measurements corresponding to the nuclear regions (see\nTable 4). For NGC 7591 we plot the values corresponding to\nthe integrated spectrum. Note that in the majority of nuclei the\nH\u03b4A indices are lower limits due to possible contamination from\nthe nebular H\u03b4 emission line. The black solid line is the time\nevolution (from 1 Myr to 5 Gyr) as predicted by the BC03 models using solar metallicity, a Salpeter IMF, and an instantaneous\nburst of star formation. The dashed lines are combinations of different evolved populations (ages 700 Myr, 1 Gyr, 2 Gyr, 3 Gyr,\nand 5 Gyr) and a young stellar population of 10 Myr. The dotted\nlines represent the fraction in mass of young stars with values of\n0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,\nand 0.8, from right to left.\n\nThe presence of extra-nuclear regions with enhanced values of the [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 and [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 ratios relative to those of H ii regions is again a common property not\nonly of the LIRGs studied here, but also of our VLT/VIMOS\nsample of LIRGs (see Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010a) and our\nWHT/INTEGRAL sample of ULIRGs (see Garc\u0131\u0301a-Mar\u0131\u0301n et al.\n2010). In our sample of LIRGs these regions tend to be associated with diffuse emission rather than with high surface\nbrightness H ii regions, as is also the case for normal and starburst galaxies (Wang, Heckman, & Lehnert 1998). Moreover,\nfor our VLT/VIMOS sample of LIRGs Monreal-Ibero et al.\n(2010a) found a correlation between the enhanced optical ratios and increasing gas velocity dispersion in interacting and\nmerger LIRGs, and this correlation is attributed to the presence\nof shocks associated with the interaction processes. Our PMAS\nsample is mostly composed of isolated galaxies and weakly interacting galaxies (see Paper I), and thus it is unlikely these processes are responsible for the enhanced line ratios. However,\nsince the majority of the regions with enhanced [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1\nand [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 ratios in our sample are observed in\nregions of relatively low EW(H\u03b1)em , we will postpone the discussion of this issue after the line ratios are corrected for the\npresence of underlying Balmer stellar absorption features (see\nSection 6.2).\n\nFig. 7. Same as Figure 6, but showing the effects of reddening\nthe young stellar population with E(B \u2212 V)young = 0.2 (upper\npanel), E(B \u2212 V)young = 0.5 (middle panel), and E(B \u2212 V)young =\n1 (bottom panel), and using the Calzetti et al.

(2003a) used a method based on the 4000\u00c5break and the Balmer H\u03b4 feature in absorption to constrain the\n\n\f8\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nmean (light-weighted) age of the stellar population of a galaxy\nand the mass fraction formed in recent bursts of star formation.\nTherefore, this method provides information about the lightaveraged properties of the stellar populations. From the stellar continuum spectra generated with BC03, we measured the\nDn (4000) and the H\u03b4A indices (see Section 2.3, and Table 2 for\ndefinitions of the indices). For an instantaneous burst of star formation the Dn (4000) index increases monotonically with the age\nof the stellar population, while the depth of the H\u03b4 line absorption feature increases until about 300 \u2212 400 Myr after the burst,\nand then decreases again (black line in Figure 6). Thus the presence of high order Balmer lines in absorption is usually interpreted as the signature of an intermediate age (100 Myr \u2212 1 Gyr)\nstellar population. The evolution of these two indices is shown\nin Figure 6 using the BC03 models and is similar to the results\nof Kauffmann et al. (2003a) and Gonz\u00e1lez-Delgado et al. (2005).\nAs discussed in Section 3, we need a combination of (at\nleast) two stellar populations to reproduce the observed properties of LIRGs, including the Dn (4000) and H\u03b4A indices. This\nis clear from Figure 6, where a single stellar population formed\nin an instantaneous burst (black line) does not reproduce the observed indices of the nuclei and regions of low-EW(H\u03b1)em in\nour sample of LIRGs. A model with a constant star formation\nrate predicts Dn (4000) < 1.2 for all ages (see figure 21 of Caputi\net al. 2008), and thus it is not appropriate for our galaxies either.\nFigure 6 shows the result of combining two stellar populations. In this diagram, the choice of the age of the ionizing stellar\npopulation is not critical because Dn (4000) and H\u03b4A do not vary\nmuch during approximately the first \u223c 10 \u2212 20 Myr of the evolution of a single stellar population formed in an instantaneous\nburst (see e.g., Gonz\u00e1lez-Delgado et al. 2005). Thus with this\nkind of diagrams we cannot constrain the age of the youngest\nstellar populations in LIRGs. As we shall see in Section 5.2,\nthe combined modelling of the stellar continuum and the nebular emission lines puts strong constraints on the properties of\nthe ionizing stellar population. In Figure 6 we then combined a\n10 Myr population with evolved stellar populations with ages of\n700 Myr, 1 Gyr, 2 Gyr, 3 Gyr, and 5 Gyr. The ages of the evolved\nstellar population are based on the location in this diagram of the\nobserved values for the nuclei and regions of low-EW(H\u03b1)em in\nour sample of LIRGs. A scenario where the evolved stellar population was formed in an instantaneous burst and the current star\nformation is taking place at a constant rate (see Sarzi et al. 2007\nfor Dn (4000) vs. H\u03b4A diagrams generated under this assumption)\nwould underpredict the strength of the H\u03b4 absorption feature for\nmost of the selected regions in our LIRGs, as was the case for\nthe star-forming regions in nuclear rings in the sample of Sarzi\net al. (2007).\nFrom Figure 6 it is clear that the main effect of combining a\nyoung population and an evolved 1 \u2212 2 Gyr stellar population is\nthe change in the observed value of the Dn (4000) index, which\nbecomes smaller as the fraction in mass of the young stellar population increases. For a combination with a younger evolved stellar population (\u223c 700 Myr) the effect is observed in both indices,\nas is the case for older evolved populations (> 2 Gyr). Based on\nthis figure and taking into account that the measured H\u03b4A are\nlower limits, the age of the evolved stellar population is between\n1 and 3 Gyr for most of the galaxies in our sample. The only\nexception is NGC 7771 that appears to show the presence of\nan intermediate age (700 Myr-1 Gyr) stellar population. We also\nshow in Figure 6 a range of mass fractions for the young stellar\npopulation, which in general are relatively small for the nuclei\nand regions of low-EW(H\u03b1)em .\n\nIn Figure 7 we show the effects on the Dn (4000) vs. H\u03b4A\ndiagram from the combination of a reddened young stellar population and an unreddened evolved population. Figure 7 clearly\ndemonstrates that not accounting for the extinction to the young\nstellar population would make us underestimate its mass fraction\nas well as underestimate the age of the evolved stellar population. However, it is also apparent from Figures 6 and 7, that it\nis not possible to disentangle the effects of extinction, ages of\nthe stellar populations, and mass contributions from this kind of\ndiagrams alone.\n5.2. Results of the modelling of the stellar continuum and\nnebular emission\n\nAs explained in Section 2.3, we selected a number of regions\nin our sample of LIRGs for the study of their stellar populations. These include the nuclear regions, the average spectra of\nregions of low-EW(H\u03b1)em , as well as a number of bright H ii\nregions in NGC 23, NGC 2388, and NGC 7771. We excluded\nfrom this analysis three galaxies for various reasons. The nuclear optical spectra of MCG +12-02-001 appears to be completely dominated by a young ionizing stellar population (that\nis, we do not see any evidence for the presence of absorption\nfeatures), and thus it was not possible to constrain the evolved\nstellar population. The signal-to-noise ratio of the nuclear spectrum of UGC 1845 did not allow us to constrain the properties\nof the stellar populations. Finally we excluded NGC 7469 because of the possible contamination of the optical spectra from\nthe AGN non-stellar continuum. We refer the reader to D\u0131\u0301azSantos et al. (2007) for a detailed study of the stellar populations\nof the ring of star formation of NGC 7469 using high angular\nresolution HST photometric data.\nTable 5 summarizes for each galaxy and region the acceptable ranges of ages and extinctions for the evolved (tevolved and\nE(B-V)evolved ) and ionizing (tyoung and E(B-V)young ) stellar populations derived from the stellar continuum fit as explained in\nSection 3.1. We also list in this table the fraction of the light in\nthe normalising bin emitted by the ionizing (young) stellar component ( fNB ), for the models that produce adequate fits. Because\nof the different shapes of the extracted spectra it was not always\npossible to select the same normalizing bin. However, the normalizing bin was always selected to be located within the wavelength range of 4400 \u2212 4800 \u00c5 and usually spanning \u223c 100\u00c5.\nFigure 8 presents a few examples of fits to the stellar continuum\nfor a number of regions in our sample.\nFor the majority of the regions studied here except for the\noptical nucleus of NGC 7771 (see Section 5.2.1), we find that\nstellar populations with ages between 100 Myr and 500 Myr do\nnot make a strong contribution to the optical light. Ages for\nthe evolved stellar populations of between 0.7 and 5 Gyr (or\neven 10 Gyr in some cases) provided reasonable fits to the optical continua. These ages are within the range of ages derived\nfor massive spiral galaxies (Gallazzi et al. 2005 and references\ntherein). Another noteworthy result is that the regions with lowEW(H\u03b1)em in the galaxies tend to have slightly older ionizing\nstellar populations and less extinction than other regions for the\nsame galaxy. The ages of the evolved stellar populations agree\nwith our findings in the previous section using the Dn (4000) and\nH\u03b4A diagram, keeping in mind that H\u03b4A may only provide a\nlower limit to the age of the evolved stars for some of the regions. We finally note that for models including evolved plus\nyoung stellar components it is particularly hard to distinguish\nbetween ages in the range 2 \u2212 10 Gyr. Therefore, in some cases\n\n\fAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\n9\n\nFig. 8.

On the\nother hand, in the nuclear regions of NGC 23 and IC 860, and\nNGC 7771, the evolved stellar populations may be the main contributors to the optical light (see also Table 6). Our spectra do\nnot sample the near-UV spectral region, which is important for\nconstraining the properties of the ionizing stellar populations.\nTherefore, the ages of such stellar populations are not well constrained when fitting the stellar continuum alone.\nWe were able to put tighter constraints on the young stellar populations when we included the nebular fitting.

The extinctions to the ionizing stellar stars range between E(B \u2212 V) = 0.2 and E(B \u2212 V) = 1.8 (Tables 5 and 6).\nThe extinctions to the ionizing stellar populations are always significantly greater than those to the evolved stars, and generally\nconsistent with those derived to the young stars from the stellar\ncontinuum modelling.\nOur results are, in a broad brush sense, consistent with those\nof Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al.

In fact, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. (2009) found adequate fits\nfor their ULIRGs which included evolved stellar populations\nof 0.3 \u2212 0.5 Gyr, while this was rarely the case for our sample of LIRGs. The stellar populations dominating the optical\n\nlight of ULIRGs could be the result of enhanced star formation coinciding with the first pass of the merging nuclei, along\nwith a further, more intense, episode of star formation occurring as the nuclei finally merge together (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et\nal. 2010a). Our sample of LIRGs on the other hand, is mostly\n\n\f12\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\ncomposed of relatively isolated spiral galaxies and weakly interacting galaxies (see Paper I), with moderate IR luminosities (see\nSection 2.1). Given the relatively small fraction of strongly interacting/merger systems in our sample compared to the Rodr\u0131\u0301guez\nZaur\u0131\u0301n et al. (2009) ULIRG sample, it may not be unexpected\nthat intermediate-age (\u223c 100 \u2212 500 Myr) stellar populations do\nnot dominate the optical light of our LIRGs. The only exception\nin our sample are the central regions of NGC 7771 (see discussion in Section 5.2.2). Moderate luminosity spiral-like LIRGs\nmay be constantly forming stars and may have not undergone a\nmajor burst of star formation in the last 1\u22122 Gyr, as is the case of\nnormal spiral galaxies (Kauffmann et al. 2003b). Our results are\nalso in accord with the observational findings of Poggianti & Wu\n(2000) that most isolated systems in their sample of IR-bright\ngalaxies showed on average more moderate Balmer absorption\nfeatures than the interacting systems. The effects of possible minor mergers are likely to be difficult to evaluate using the stellar populations as models and observations suggest that it is the\nsatellite galaxy rather than the primary galaxy that is more susceptible to enhanced star formation (Woods & Geller 2007; Cox\net al. 2008).\n5.2.1. The central regions of NGC 7771\n\nThere is dynamical evidence that NGC 7771 is weakly interacting with NGC 7770 (Keel 1993) and is located in a group\nof galaxies. It is then possible that the interaction process resulted in a strong burst of star formation in the past. For instance, the ring in this galaxy, clearly detected in our Pa\u03b1 images\n(see Paper I), appears to have a complex star formation history\nwith evidence for multiple generations of stars (Davies, AlonsoHerrero, & Ward 1997; Smith et al. 1999; Reunanen et al. 2000).\nThe optical nucleus of NGC 7771 is the only region in our\nsample of LIRGs for which adequate fits were obtained with a\nlarge contribution to the optical light from an intermediate-age\n(300 \u2212 500 Myr) stellar population (see Table 5 and Figure 8).\nThe fit to the average spectrum of regions with low EW(H\u03b1)em\nalso required an evolved stellar population of 500 \u2212 700 Myr.\nIn the case of the nuclear spectrum there is evidence for an\nadditional stellar population based on the presence of He i absorption features at various wavelengths, which are indicated in\nFigure 8.b. These absorption lines are strongest for stellar populations with ages in the range 20 \u2212 50 Myr (Gonz\u00e1lez-Delgado\net al. 1999; 2005), and are not observed in stellar populations\nolder than 100 Myr (the lifetime of B stars). The presence of this\nimportant population of non-ionizing stars dominated by B stars\nwas already infered by Davies et al. (1997). Given the clear evidence for the presence of B stars, for this region we also tried\ncombinations including stellar populations of 30\u221280 Myr for the\nyoung component. We found that a combination with a dominant\n( fNB = 70 \u2212 80%), low reddening (E(B \u2212 V)young \u223c 0.2) stellar\npopulation of 40 \u2212 50 Myr plus an unreddened evolved stellar\npopulation of few Gyr provided an acceptable fit. We note that\nwith this combination the stellar population responsible for ionizing the gas is not accounted for. Therefore, in this particular\ncase, it is likely that models including a larger number of stellar\ncomponents (at least three) would be more adequate. We again\nemphasize that the nuclear region of NGC 7771 is the only region where we find a clear evidence for these He i features. In\nthis respect, it is not clear if the optical nucleus of this galaxy\nmay be a special region in this galaxy (see Davies et al. 1997 for\na discussion on this issue). It is important to recall at this point\nthat the optical nucleus of NGC 7771 is probably not the true\nnucleus of the galaxy, as it does not coincide with the center of\n\nFig. 9. Theoretical Dn (4000) vs. H\u03b2A (upper panel) and\nDn (4000) vs. H\u03b1A (lower panel) diagrams. The black solid line\nis the time evolution (from 1 Myr to 5 Gyr) as predicted by the\nBC03 models using solar metallicity, a Salpeter IMF, and an instantaneous burst of star formation. The dashed lines are combinations of different evolved populations (ages 700 Myr, 1 Gyr,\n2 Gyr, 3 Gyr, and 5 Gyr) and a young ionizing stellar population\nof 6 Myr. The dotted lines represent the contribution in mass of\nthe two stellar populations, as in Figure 6.\nthe bright ring of star formation, the peak of near-IR emission\n(see Paper I), or even with the region with the largest value of\nEW(H\u03b1)em (see Figure 1.j).\n5.3. Predictions for the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 stellar absorption features\n\nTo study in detail the optical line ratios and in particular those\nof the diffuse regions, we need to correct for the presence of H\u03b2\nand H\u03b1 stellar absorption features. However, given the strong\nstar formation activity in our sample, it is difficult to measure\nreliably these absorption features because of the strong contamination produced by the Balmer recombination lines in emission.\nAn alternative approach is to generate theoretical diagrams of\nDn (4000) vs. H\u03b1A and Dn (4000) vs. H\u03b2A measured from the\nspectra generated from the combination of the BC03 young and\nevolved stellar populations as explained in Section 3.1. The H\u03b2A\nand H\u03b1A indices for the stellar absorption features are defined\nin a similar way to that used for the H\u03b4 absorption feature (see\nSection 2.3), and thus have a positive value. The line windows,\n\n\fAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nand the blue and red pseudo-continuum windows defined by\nGonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. (2005) are given in Table 1. For the\nages of the evolved stellar population we used those derived\nin Section 5.2. For the ionizing stellar population we chose an\nage of 6 Myr, which is representative of our sample of LIRGs\n(Tables 5 and 6), although the results are not strongly dependent\nof chosen age of this population. For the mass fractions we used\nthe same values as those shown in Figure 6.\nFrom the Dn (4000) vs. H\u03b2A diagram (Figure 9, upper panel),\nwe can see that for ages of the evolved stellar population of between 1 and 5 Gyr, the predicted average value of the H\u03b2A index\nis \u223c 5\u00b11 \u00c5. This value is almost independent of the mass fraction\nin young stars, except for cases where the stellar mass is dominated by the contribution from ionizing stars. For NGC 7771,\nwhich is the clearest case in our sample for the presence of an\nintermediate age stellar population, the predicted value would be\nH\u03b2A \u223c 7 \u00b1 1 \u00c5. In this case, the predicted value is more sensitive to the mass in young stars and the age of the evolved stellar\npopulation. For comparison, the measurements of H\u03b2A reported\nby Kim et al. (1995) for the central 2 kpc of the galaxies in common with our sample are 3 and 6 \u00c5, although Kim et al. (1995)\npointed out these values were admittedly subjective because of\nthe method they used for fitting their data.\nFigure 9 (lower panel) shows the predictions for the\nDn (4000) vs. H\u03b1A diagram. In the case of H\u03b1A there is a very\nsmall dependence of the predicted value with the mass fraction\nin young stars. For the majority of our LIRGs with ages of the\nstellar population 1 \u2212 5 Gyr the average predicted value for the\nindex would be H\u03b1A \u223c 3 \u00b1 0.5 \u00c5, whereas for NGC 7771 we\nwould predict H\u03b1A \u223c 4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00c5. For comparison, Moustakas &\nKennicutt (2006b) found an average H\u03b1 stellar absorption correction of 2.8 \u00b1 0.4 \u00c5 for the integrated spectra of a sample of\nnearby star forming galaxies.\n\n6. Excitation Conditions in local LIRGs\n6.1. Spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams\n\nDiagnostic diagrams using bright optical emission lines (Balwin\net al. 1981 and Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987) are useful for differentiating between the various sources of excitation of the gas in\nthe nuclei of galaxies and their integrated emission. With optical\nIFS data we can additionally study the distribution of the ionization structure of spatially resolved regions (that is, on a spaxelby-spaxel basis) of nearby galaxies (e.g., Garc\u0131\u0301a-Mar\u0131\u0301n et al.\n2006; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Lorenzo et al. 2008; Blanc et al. 2009; Stoklasov\u00e1\net al. 2009; Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010b; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Mar\u0131\u0301n et al.\n2010), as well as of H ii regions in nearby galaxies (e.g., Rela\u00f1o\net al 2010). The diagnostic diagrams for the spatially resolved\nmeasurements for each of the LIRGs in our sample are shown in\nFigure 2. The measurements for the individual spaxels are color\ncoded according to the observed value of the EW(H\u03b1)em in emission. In these diagrams we plotted the empirical and theoretical\nboundaries derived by Kauffmann et al. (2003c) and Kewley et\nal. (2001). These boundaries are shown for reference as they may\nprovide clues about the dominant excitation mechanism: ionization by young stars, shocks, or AGN ionization.\nThe first result worth noticing is that a large number of\nthe spatially resolved measurements in the [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 vs.\n[N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 diagram (Fig. 2, left panels) fall in the composite region, and in particular a large fraction of those spaxels\nwith EW(H\u03b1)em < 20 \u00c5. A similar result is found for ULIRGs\n(Garc\u0131\u0301a-Mar\u0131\u0301n et al. 2010). On the other hand, most of the spax-\n\n13\n\nels with EW(H\u03b1)em > 60 \u00c5 are located in the H ii region of the\ndiagram, with the only exception of some regions in NGC 7469.\nThere are also differences from galaxy to galaxy. For instance\nthe majority of the spaxels of MCG +12-02-001 and NGC 5936\nare located in the H ii region of the diagram, while other cases\nsuch as UGC 1845 most spaxels are in the composite region.\nThe composite region on this diagram lies between the observational AGN/H ii boundary and the \"maximum starburst line\" of\nKewley et al. (2001), above which the observed line ratios cannot be explained by star formation alone. Kewley et al. (2006)\ninterpreted the observed ratios in the composite region as produced by a metal-rich stellar population and an AGN (but see\nCid Fernandes et al. 2010 and references therein, for an opposing point of view). While the Kewley et al. argument is valid for\nnuclear and even integrated spectra of galaxies, in our sample a\nlarge fraction of spaxels with enhanced line ratios are detected\nin the extra-nuclear regions of galaxies without an AGN.\nThe number of spatially resolved measurements located in\nthe LINER region of the diagrams of the other two diagnostic\ndiagrams (Fig. 2, middle and right panels), is smaller than in\nthe diagram with the [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 ratio (see also Veilleux et\nal. 1995). This is in part a sensitivity issue, especially for the\nrelatively faint [O i]\u03bb6300 line, which is, on the other hand, a\nvery good shock tracer. Still, a large fraction of spaxels with\nEW(H\u03b1)em < 20 \u00c5, mostly in NGC 23, MCG+02-20-003, and\nNGC 7771, are in the LINER region of these two diagnostic\ndiagrams. The presence of extra-nuclear regions in LIRGs and\nULIRGs with LINER-like excitation has often been interpreted\nas an indication for the presence of large scale shocks where\ninteractions are playing a major role (Monreal-Ibero, Arribas,\n& Colina 2006; Monreal-Ibero et al. 2010a) or to shocks due\nto the presence of outflowing nuclear gas (see e.g., Armus et\nal. 1989). Calzetti et al. (2004) using a [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 vs.\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 diagram with spatially resolved measurements of four nearby starburst galaxies, found evidence for the\npresence of non-photoionized gas. These authors also demonstrated that shocks from supernovae and stellar winds are able\nto provide sufficient mechanical energy to account for the nonphotoionized gas in their galaxies. In the case of this sample of\nLIRGs, most galaxies do not show evidence for strong interactions either from their morphologies or from the observed H\u03b1 velocity fields (see Paper I). Our LIRGs, however present very high\ncentral H\u03b1 surface brightnesses and thus star formation rates\nper surface area (see Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006), which would\nimply a contribution from supernovae. One important caveat to\nkeep in mind is that the observed line ratios in the diagnostic\ndiagrams of Figure 2 have not been corrected for the presence\nof stellar absorption. These corrections will be most relevant for\nthose spaxels with the lowest equivalent widths of the hydrogen\nrecombination emission lines, as we shall see in the following\nsection.\n6.2. Spatially resolved [N ii]\u03bb6584 /H\u03b1 vs.\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 diagrams\n\nIn our own Galaxy and other galaxies enhanced [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1\nand [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 line ratios appear to be associated\nwith the presence of diffuse ionized gas (DIG3 , see the recent review by Haffner et al. 2009 and references therein). The\npresence of DIG emission has been detected spectroscopically\nin the extra-planar emission of edge-on galaxies (Rand 1996;\n3\nThis gas is also referred to as diffuse ionized medium or DIM, and\nwarm ionized medium or WIM.\n\n\f14\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nFig. 10. Spatially resolved [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 vs. [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 diagrams for the full PMAS sample. The individual measurements (a total of 1852 spaxels) in both panels are color coded according to the observed EW(H\u03b1)em in emission as in Figure 2. The\nleft panel shows the ratios not corrected for underlying H\u03b1 stellar absorption, whereas the right panel are the line ratios corrected\nfor underlying H\u03b1 stellar absorption as described in Section 5.3. The contours are plotted to help assess the data point density in\nbins of 0.1 dex in both emission line ratios.\nMiller & Veilleux 2003). A similar result was infered based on\nthe enhanced low-ionization emission relative to that of H ii regions of the integrated emission of galaxies (see e.g., Lehnert &\nHeckman 1994; Wang, Heckman, & Lehnert 1997; Moustakas\n& Kennicutt 2006a) as well as on spatially resolved measurements (see e.g., Calzetti et al. 2004). In Paper I we already discussed the possibility of the presence of this diffuse emission in\nour sample of LIRGs, as in general the integrated line ratios of\nthe galaxies are greater than the typical values observed in disk\nH ii regions (see Kennicutt et al. 1989). Moreover, the regions\nof enhanced line ratios in our LIRGs are generally not associated with regions of high Pa\u03b1 surface brightness, that is, bright\nH ii regions. Clear examples of this are NGC 23, NGC 7591 and\nNGC 7771 (see Figure 1 and Paper I). Regions of enhanced low\nionization emission can also be associated to the presence of an\nAGN in the form of an ionization cone, as is the case of one of\nthe nuclei of the interacting LIRG Arp 299 (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Mar\u0131\u0301n et al.\n2006).\n\ninterstellar medium. We chose models with solar and twice solar metallicity based on the derived abundances of our galaxies\nfrom the integrated line ratios over the central few kpc (Paper I)\ncorrected for stellar absorption (see Section 5.3). To estimate the\nabundances, we used the Pettini & Pagel (2004) empirical calibration based on the [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 and [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 ratios,\nalso known as the O3N2 index (see Alloin et al. 1979). All the\nLIRGs in our sample have near solar or super-solar abundances\n(see Table 7), for a solar abundance of 12 + log (O/H) = 8.66\n(Asplund et al. 2004), and are within the derived abundances of\nthe large sample of LIRGs studied by Rupke et al. (2008).\n\nTo study in more detail the excitation conditions in\nour sample of LIRGs, we produced spatially resolved\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 vs. [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 diagrams for each of\nthe galaxies (see Figure 3). The advantages of these diagrams\nover the standard diagnostic diagrams are twofold. First they\ncontain more data points than the diagnostic diagrams (see the\nstatistics in Table 1 for the number of spaxels with measurements\nfor each line ratio) because H\u03b2 in LIRGs is heavily affected\nby extinction and stellar absorption. Second, as we showed in\nSection 5.3, the corrections for the presence of stellar absorption\nin H\u03b1 are less dependent on the results of the stellar population\nmodels than those for H\u03b2.\n\nAlthough we do not intend to use the Dopita et al. models for dating the H ii regions, it is clear that line ratios of\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 \u223c 0.6 \u2212 1 could be produced by evolved\nand metal rich H ii regions (see details in Dopita et al. 2006).\nAs can be seen from Figure 3, the [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 vs.\n[N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 diagrams of the central regions of some galaxies (e.g., MCG+12-02-001 and NGC 5936) could be mostly explained as emission coming from H ii regions, although it has\nto be noted that there are no spaxels with EW(H\u03b1)em < 5 \u00c5 in\nthe central regions of these galaxies. On the other hand, galaxies like NGC 23, NGC 7591 and NGC 7771 show a significant numbers of spaxels with EW(H\u03b1)em < 20 \u00c5 whose line\nratios (not corrected for stellar absorption) cannot be explained\nby the Dopita et al. (2006) H ii region models. Shock models\nsuch as those of Allen et al. (2008) could explain line ratios\nlog ([N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1) > \u22120.7 and log ([S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1) >\n\u22120.7. These models are not plotted in Figure 3, but see figure 8\nof Monreal-Ibero et al. (2010a) and a discussion by Miller &\nVeilleux (2003).\n\nA comparison between the observed [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1\nvs. [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 ratios and predictions from different models\n(ionization by young stars, shocks, AGN photoionization) can\nshed some light on the dominant excitation conditions in our\nsample of LIRGs. In Figure 3 we show the Dopita et al. (2006)\nmodels for evolving H ii regions. In these models the ionization\nparameter is replaced by the R parameter, which is defined as\nthe ratio of the mass of the ionizing cluster to the pressure of the\n\nTo get a more global picture of the excitation conditions in\nLIRGs, in Figure 10 (left panel) we plot a [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 vs.\n[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 diagram for the full PMAS sample, showing a total number of 1852 spaxels again color coded in terms\nof EW(H\u03b1)em in emission. It is clear from this figure that those\nspaxels with the smallest EW(H\u03b1)em tend to show the largest values of the line ratios, indicating that in part the enhanced values\nare due to the presence of H\u03b1 stellar absorption. The right panel\n\n\fAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\n15\n\nof Figure 10 shows the same diagram after correcting statistically each spaxel for the presence of H\u03b1 in absorption, with the\naverage values of H\u03b1A derived in Section 5.3. The effect of correcting the emission line ratios for stellar absorption in our sample is evident, especially for spaxels with EW(H\u03b1)em < 20 \u00c5.\nHowever, as can be seen from the histograms in Figure 11, even\nafter the correction for stellar absorption there is still a significant number of spaxels with enhanced line ratios. For example,\nafter correction for stellar absorption approximately 25% of the\nspaxels show log ([S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1) > \u22120.2, which is the\nlargest line ratio allowed by the 2Z\u2299 Dopita et al. (2006) models.\nThis suggests that there are other mechanisms apart from young\nstars ionizing the gas in our sample of LIRGs.\nWe can now compare our observations with those of\nMonreal-Ibero et al. (2010a) for the VLT/VIMOS sample of\nLIRGs. The VIMOS sample was observed with a mean spatial\nsampling of 270 pc per spaxel, which is similar to that of the\nPMAS data. The Monreal-Ibero et al. (2010a) sample contains\ngalaxies chosen to probe the different morphologies observed\nin LIRGs from relatively isolated galaxies, to interacting galaxies to mergers. In that study we found that the median value of\nthe [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 ratios measured on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis has a very weak dependence with the morphology of the\nsystem. The distributions of the [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 and the\n[O i]\u03bb6300/H\u03b1 ratios, on the other hand, tend to be more enhanced for galaxies classified as interacting and mergers. Our\nPMAS sample is smaller than the VIMOS sample, but it is representative of the LIRG class, in the sense that it comprises the\nmajority of the IRAS RBGS LIRGs at d < 75 Mpc that can be\nobserved from Calar Alto. As such, the PMAS sample is mostly\ncomposed of LIRGs with relatively low IR luminosities, and thus\ndominated by isolated spiral galaxies or systems in weak interaction (see also Sanders & Ishida 2004). The median values of\nthe line ratios (on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis) in the PMAS sample corrected for stellar absorption are [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 = 0.45\nand [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 = 0.44 (see also Figure 11). For the\nstatistics we used only spaxels with measurements of both line\nratios. These ratios are comparable to, although slightly greater\nthan, those measured by Monreal-Ibero et al. (2010a) for the\nVLT/VIMOS sample of LIRGs. The slight difference may be\ndue to the fact that the PMAS data probe more regions (spaxels) with low EW(H\u03b1)em than in the VLT/VIMOS sample (see\nRodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. 2010b). This in turn results in the PMAS\ndata being more sensitive to diffuse emission.\n\nFig. 11.

Abundances and fraction of diffuse ionized emission in\nthe central regions of LIRGs.\nGalaxy\n\n6.3. Diffuse emission\n\nRegardless of the main mechanism responsible for exciting the\ndiffuse gas in galaxies (e.g., massive stars, escaping photons\nfrom H ii regions, shocks), it is clear that quantifying the fraction\nof diffuse emission in galaxies is important for understanding issues such as the early reionization of the universe. Traditionally\nthe fraction of diffuse emission in galaxies was obtained by identifying and doing photometry of H ii regions, to separate the\nemission coming from H ii regions from that of the DIG (see\ne.g., Zurita, Rozas, & Beckman 2000; Oey et al. 2007, see review by Haffner et al. 2009). The main results from this method\nwere that the mean fraction of diffuse emission in galaxies was\n50 \u2212 60% with no correlation with the Hubble morphological\ntype (Thilker et al. 2002; Oey et al. 2007). However, Oey et al.\n(2007) found that starburst galaxies showed lower fractions of\ndiffuse H\u03b1 emission when compared to other galaxies.\n\n12 + log(O/H)\n\nDIG fraction\nNICMOS 2\u00d7MW - MW\nNGC 23\n8.8\n19+8\n6 \u2212 32\n\u22124\nMCG +12-02-001\n8.7\n8+3\n9 \u2212 35\n\u22122\nUGC 1845\n8.7\n30+13\n1 \u2212 16\n\u22127\nNGC 2388\n8.8\n21+9\n2 \u2212 17\n\u22125\nMCG +02-20-003\n8.7\n50+13\n24 \u2212 60\n\u22128\nNGC 5936\n8.9\n58+15\n1 \u2212 16\n\u221210\nNGC 6701\n8.9\n43+18\n4 \u2212 28\n\u221210\nNGC 7469\n\u2013\n\u2013\n2 \u2212 23\n47\n\u2212 76\nNGC 7591\n8.9\n76+19\n\u221213\nNGC 7771\n8.9\n44+19\n1 \u2212 10\n\u221210\nNotes.- The abundances are derived using the O3N2 index measured\nin the integrated PMAS spectra (Section 6.2). The NICMOS DIG fractions are from H ii region photometry on the HST/NICMOS Pa\u03b1 images.\nThe 2 \u00d7 MW and MW DIG fractions are from comparing the spatially\nresolved [S ii]\u03bb6717/H\u03b1 ratios in our LIRGs with those of the Milky\nWay H ii regions and DIG (see Section 6.3 for details).\n\n\f16\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nIn Alonso-Herrero et al. (2006) we measured the Pa\u03b1\nfluxes of H ii regions, and estimated the total Pa\u03b1 fluxes using\nHST/NICMOS narrow band images, for similar FoVs to those\nof the PMAS data. Due to the relatively small FoV of the Pa\u03b1\nNICMOS images (NIC2 camera 19\u2032\u2032 \u00d719\u2032\u2032 ) the main uncertainty\nin measuring Pa\u03b1 fluxes, both in H ii regions and the total (H ii\n+ DIG) emission is the background removal. On the other hand,\nnarrow-band Pa\u03b1 imaging does not suffer from problems associated with contamination by the [N ii] doublet associated with\nusing narrow-band H\u03b1 imaging (see Blanc et al. 2009 for a discussion on the issue). For each galaxy we measured the total\nPa\u03b1 luminosity over the NICMOS FoV, and converted it to H\u03b1\nflux assuming case B recombination (H\u03b1/Pa\u03b1 = 8.6, Hummer\n& Storey 1987). Using the total H\u03b1 luminosity and the H\u03b1 luminosity in H ii regions given in table 3 of Alonso-Herrero et\nal. (2006), we computed the DIG fraction for each galaxy. The\nDIG fractions are between 8 to 76% (Table 7). The range given\nfor each galaxy takes into account the uncertainties in calculating the total Pa\u03b1 emission from the HST/NICMOS narrow-band\nimaging (see Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006 for details). The DIG\nfractions given in this table for each LIRG correspond only to the\ncentral few kiloparsecs, as neither the NICMOS nor the PMAS\nobservations cover the full extent of the galaxies.\nAlternatively Blanc et al. (2009) computed the DIG fraction in M51 from optical IFS by comparing the observed\n[S ii]\u03bb6717/H\u03b1 line ratios with the typical values measured for\nH ii regions and the DIG in the Milky Way (MW) by Madsen\net al. (2006), and taking into account the difference in metallicity between M51 and the MW. The PMAS 1\u2032\u2032 spaxel covers\napproximately 300 pc for the typical distances of our galaxies\n(Section 2.1). Defining the sizes of H ii regions, even at HST\nresolutions, is not straightforward, but results for LIRGs at distances similar to those of the PMAS sample, indicate typical\nsizes of \u223c 150 \u2212 200 pc (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2002). We thus\nexpect that each measurement of a given line ratio contains both\nH ii region and DIG emission, as assumed by the Blanc et al.\n(2009) method. In the MW the average [S ii]\u03bb6717/H\u03b1 line ratios of H ii regions and the diffuse emission are 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 and\n0.34 \u00b1 0.13, respectively (Madsen et al. 2006; Blanc et al. 2009).\nIn Table 7 we list the DIG fractions we obtained with the line\n[S ii]\u03bb6717/H\u03b1 ratios corrected for stellar absorption and the\nBlanc et al. (2009) method. For each galaxy we give a range,\nwith the smallest value corresponding to scaling the MW H ii\nand DIG ratios to \u223c 1.7 times solar, and the largest ratio for solar metallicity.\nTable 7 shows that the fraction of diffuse emission in the\ncentral few kpc of our LIRGs varies significantly from galaxy\nto galaxy. Oey et al. (2007) found that starburst galaxies, defined as galaxies having H\u03b1 surface brightnesses above 2.5 \u00d7\n1039 erg s\u22121 kpc\u22122 within the H\u03b1 half radius, have relatively\nsmall DIG fractions (< 60%), when compared to non-starburst\ngalaxies. According to this definition all our galaxies are starbursts (see Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006), and thus in most cases\nour DIG fractions are below 60%. The large DIG fraction inferred for NGC 7591 may be explained if some of enhanced\nline ratios are produced in a narrow line region associated with\nthe AGN in this galaxy. We also find that the fractions of DIG\nemission in the central few kpc obtained with the two methods\ndescribed above mostly agree with each other, within the uncertainties (Table 7). We note however, that the line ratio method\nalways tends to provide a smaller DIG fraction than the H ii region photometry method (see also Blanc et al. 2009 for M51).\nThe two LIRGs with the most discrepant fractions using the\ntwo methods are NGC 5936 and NGC 7771. In the case of\n\nNGC 5936 we attribute the discrepancy to the fact that, except\nfor the very nuclear regions, the other H ii regions in the FoV of\nthe NICMOS images appear quite diffuse (see Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2006, and Paper I), and thus the DIG fraction estimated\nfrom the NICMOS Pa\u03b1 images is clearly just an upper limit. In\nthe case of NGC 7771, even if we applied the smaller correction for the H\u03b1 absorption feature (that is, if the evolved stellar\npopulation had an age of a few Gyr), the DIG fraction from the\n[S ii]\u03bb6717/H\u03b1 line ratios would be in the range of 3 to 13%.\nThe most likely explanation is that the faintest H ii regions just\noutside the bright ring of star formation were not identified in\nthe NICMOS Pa\u03b1 images, and this resulted in an overestimate\nof the diffuse emission.\n\n7. Summary\nThis is the second paper of a series presenting a PMAS IFS\nstudy of 11 local (average distance of 61 Mpc) LIRGs covering the central few kiloparsecs of the galaxies. We selected the\ngalaxies from the complete volume-limited sample of LIRG of\nAlonso-Herrero et al. (2006), which has an average IR luminosity of log(LIR /L\u2299 ) = 11.32. As such, our sample of LIRGs is\nmostly composed of isolated spiral galaxies, galaxies with companions, and weakly interacting galaxies. The PMAS observations covered a spectral range of 3700 \u2212 7200 \u00c5, with a spectral\nresolution of 6.8 \u00c5 (FWHM). We used a 1\u2032\u2032 -size spaxel that provides a typical physical sampling of approximately 300 pc. The\nPMAS observations were complemented with our own existing\nHST/NICMOS observations of the near-infrared continuum and\nthe Pa\u03b1 emission line. We combined the spectral information\nprovided by the PMAS IFS and the spatial information provided\nby the HST/NICMOS observations to study in detail the stellar populations, the excitation conditions of the gas, and diffuse\nemission in local LIRGs.\nTo study the stellar populations we selected the nuclear regions of each galaxy, as well as a number of bright H ii regions\nin NGC 23, NGC 2388, and NGC 7771. We also extracted for\neach galaxy, when possible, the average spectrum of regions\nwith low values of EW(H\u03b1)em . These regions were selected such\nthat they did not contain high surface brightness H ii regions to\nminimize the contamination by hydrogen nebular emission in\nthe stellar absorption features. We used BC03 and Starburst99 to\nfit the stellar continuum and the nebular emission, respectively.\nFor the modelling we assumed two stellar populations formed\nin instantaneous bursts with a Salpeter IMF and solar metallicity. The PMAS maps of EW(H\u03b1)em in our sample of LIRGs (see\nFigure 1), except for the nuclear region of IC 860 (Table 4), indicate ages of the young stellar populations of between 5 and\n\u223c 10 \u2212 20 Myr (see e.g., Leitherer et al. 1999, and Section 3.1).\nWe thus chose ages of the ionizing stellar populations of between\n1 and 20 Myr, and \u2265 100 Myr for the evolved one. Both stellar\npopulations were extinguished with a range of values of E(B-V).\nCombinations of evolved stellar populations with ages between 0.7 and 5 \u2212 10 Gyr with relatively low extinctions, and\nionizing stellar populations with higher extinctions provided\nreasonable fits to the optical continua of most of our regions.\nThe spectra of our LIRGs tend to show deeper MgIb and Gbands than the ULIRGs in the Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. (2010a)\nsample. This suggests that the stellar populations in our sample are somewhat older. In fact, we found little evidence for a\nstrong contribution to the optical light from intermediate-aged\nstellar populations with ages of \u223c 100 \u2212 500 Myr in our sample of LIRGs. The only exception in our sample is NGC 7771.\n\n\fAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nSeveral of the regions studied in this galaxy, including its optical nucleus, show clear indications for an important contribution\nfrom an intermediate-aged stellar population (\u223c 100 \u2212 700 Myr).\nAdditionally the optical nucleus of NGC 7771 contains a large\nnumber of stars with ages in the range 30 \u2212 50 Myr, as indicated\nby the presence of strong He i absorption features.\nThe majority of the selected regions in our sample of LIRGs\nhave a significant contribution to the 4600 \u00c5 continuum light\nfrom the ionizing stellar populations, and for about one-third the\nionizing stellar populations have a dominant contribution. The\nages of the evolved stellar populations of our LIRGs are within\nthe ranges observed in massive spiral galaxies. The fitting of the\nstellar continuum and the nebular properties yielded ages of the\nionizing stellar populations of between 5 and 9 Myr, and extinctions in the range E(B \u2212 V)young = 0.2 \u2212 1.8. The extinctions\nfrom the stellar continuum fits and the Balmer decrement agree\nwith each other, and tend to be higher than those required for the\nevolved stellar populations.\nWe used the brightest emission lines to study the spatially\nresolved (on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis) excitation conditions in\nthe central few kiloparsecs of our sample of LIRGs. When using\ntraditional diagnostic diagrams involving bright optical emission\nlines, the location of the spatially-resolved line ratios varies from\nLIRG to LIRG. Some galaxies have most of their spaxels in the\nH ii region of the diagnostic diagrams, while others have spaxels located both in the H ii and LINER regions of the diagrams.\nIn particular, a significant fraction of spaxels with EW(H\u03b1)em <\n20 \u00c5 have enhanced [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1, [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 and\n[O i]\u03bb6300/H\u03b1 line ratios, when compared to those of H ii regions. These spaxels tend to be associated with regions of diffuse H\u03b1 and Pa\u03b1 emission in these galaxies, that is, they do not\ncoincide with high surface brightness H ii regions identified in\nthe HST/NICMOS Pa\u03b1 images.\nWe also produced spatially resolved [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1\nvs. [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 diagrams for each of the galaxies, and the full\nPMAS sample. These diagrams have the advantage of containing more data points than the traditional diagnostic diagrams,\nand of having smaller corrections for the presence of H\u03b1 stellar absorption than diagrams using H\u03b2. Even so, the corrections for stellar absorption to the observed line ratios are significant for spaxels with EW(H\u03b1)em < 20 \u00c5. After the correction for stellar absorption, there is still a significant number of\nspaxels in these diagrams whose line ratios cannot be explained\nas produced entirely by photoionization by young stars (e.g.,\nlog[S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 > \u22120.2). These enhanced ratios are\nprobably due to the combined contributions of H ii region emission and DIG emission. We estimated the fraction of DIG emission in the central few kiloparsecs of our LIRG using two different methods. The first one used H ii region photometry from\nthe NICMOS Pa\u03b1 images. The second method was based on the\ncomparison of the spatially-resolved [S ii]\u03bb6717/H\u03b1 line ratios\nof our LIRGs, and those of the MW H ii regions and DIG. The\nDIG fractions over the central few kiloparsecs vary from galaxy\nto galaxy, but are generally < 60%, as found for starburst galaxies by Oey et al. (2007).\nAcknowledgements.

The FoV of the\nPMAS maps is 16\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 16\u2032\u2032 , and the orientation is North up, East to the left. The crosses on the maps mark the peak of the PMAS\noptical continuum emission at \u223c 6200 \u00c5 (see Paper I for details).

(a) Observed diagnostic diagrams for the spatially resolved measurements of NGC 23. The line ratios are not corrected for\nextinction or underlying stellar absorption. The star symbols are the nuclear region measurements given in Paper I. The line ratios\nfor individual spaxels are color coded according to the value of the EW(H\u03b1)em of the line in emission: green dots EW(H\u03b1)em > 60 \u00c5,\norange dots 20 \u00c5< EW(H\u03b1)em \u2264 60 \u00c5, blue dots 5 \u00c5< EW(H\u03b1)em \u2264 20 \u00c5, and red dots EW(H\u03b1)em \u2264 5 \u00c5. The solid lines are the\n\"maximum starburst lines\" defined by Kewley et al. (2001) from theoretical modeling, and the thick dashed lines are the empirical\nseparation between AGN and H ii regions of Kauffmann et al. (2003), and between Seyfert and LINERs of Kewley et al. (2006).\n\nFig. 2. (b) As Fig. 2a but for MCG +12-02-001.\n\n\f26\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nFig. 2.

Spatially resolved observed [N ii]\u03bb6584/H\u03b1 vs. [S ii]\u03bb\u03bb6717,6731/H\u03b1 diagrams for each of the galaxies in our sample. The\nindividual spaxel measurements are color coded according to EW(H\u03b1)em as in Figure 2. The spaxels corresponding to the nuclear\nregion are shown as a star-like symbol. The line ratios are not corrected for underlying stellar absorption or extinction. The error bars\nare the typical uncertainties in the measured line ratios for the smallest range of EW(H\u03b1)em , color-coded as the data points, measured\nfor each galaxy. The uncertainties in the line ratios of spaxels with EW(H\u03b1)em greater than the plotted range are always smaller.\nThe solid lines are the Dopita et al. (2006) models for evolving H ii regions for instantaneous star formation and 2Z\u2299 metallicity in\nall cases except for the MCG +12-02-001, UGC 1845 and MCG +02-20-003 plots where we show the Z\u2299 models (see Table 7 for\nthe estimated abundances). The pink, dark blue and light blue lines correspond to log R parameters of \u22122, \u22124, and \u22126. The dashed\nlines are isochrones for ages 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 Myr from top to bottom. The R parameter is defined as the ratio of the mass of the\nionizing cluster to the pressure of the interstellar medium.\n\n\f30\n\nAlonso-Herrero et al.: PMAS Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy of Luminous Infrared Galaxies.\n\nFig. 3. Continued. For NGC 7469 and NGC 7591 we identified the nuclear regions as the 4 central brightest spaxels at 6200 \u00c5, as\nthese two galaxies contain an active nucleus and the seeing (FWHM) was larger than the spaxel size.\n\n\f"}
