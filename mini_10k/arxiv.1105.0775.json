By now,\nmany structural, electronic, and vibrational properties\nof fullerenes have been studied in detail. In spite of\nthe rapidly increasing interest in new forms of fullerenes,\nicosahedral C60 , the \"most beautiful molecule\" [2], remains at the focus of active research as a prototype\nfullerene system. Fullerene molecule C60 keeps a prominent position primarily for the high symmetry which\ngreatly facilitates theoretical computations and the interpretation of experimental data, but also because it is\nonly fullerene which can be grown in the form of large and\nnearly perfect single crystals. At room temperature, the\ndiffraction experiments [3] show that the C60 molecules\nare centered on sites of a face-centered-cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice. Each C60 molecule in the solid-state phase\nis coupled to other C60 molecules through weak Van-der\nWaals forces.\nBy now, the internal oscillations of the fullerene\nmolecule C60 are well studied, for the case of an isolated\nmolecule and also for C60 crystalline structures. Various\ntheoretical and numerical methods have been developed\nand employed. However, the dynamics of fullerenes in the\nnonlinear regime and a role of nonlinear localized modes\nin such structures remain largely unexplored.\nThe main aim of this paper is to study strongly localized nonlinear oscillatory modes in such nanocrystals\nwhich resemble the discrete breathers of much simpler\nnonlinear lattices.\nHigh symmetry of C60 molecules allows the existence\nof internal nonlinear oscillations which do not alter substantially the spherical shape of the fullerene molecule.\nSuch oscillations are excited by rotational degrees of\nfreedom of pentagons and hexagons of the structure,\nwith a variation of valent bonds. Resonant coupling\nof such high-amplitude oscillations with the neighboring\nC60 molecules will remain weak, because due to conservation of a spherical shape the molecules will interact\nas large particle through Lennard-Jones potentials. This\nobservation suggests that such structures can provide an\nideal environment for the existence of nonlinear modes\n\nstrongly localized in the space [4, 5].\nHere we demonstrate that the C60 crystals can support long-lived strongly localized nonlinear modes which\nclosely resemble the so-called discrete breathers in simple nonlinear lattices, and affect dramatically the heat\nrelaxation of composite fullerene structures that obeys a\npower low instead of an exponential law.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND SIMULATION METHODS\n\nTo analyze the dynamics of of localized nonlinear\nmodes in three-dimensional C60 crystals, we consider a\ncubic nanocluster of C60 molecules, as shown in Fig. 1 (a).\nInside of each C60 molecule of the nanocluster two\nneighboring carbon atoms create a valent bond. We describe the energy associated with deformation of the valent bond created by two carbon atoms by the following\ninteraction potential\nU1 (\u03c1) = \u01eb1 {exp[\u2212\u03b10 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 )] \u2212 1}2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the length of the valent bond, \u01eb1 = 4.9632 eV\nand \u03c10 = 1.418 \u00c5 is the energy and the equilibrium\nlength of the bond, parameter \u03b10 = 1.7889 \u00c5\u22121 . Each\ncarbon atom is placed at the vertex of three planar valent\nangles. The corresponding deformation energy of a plane\nvalent angle created by three atoms can be described by\nthe interaction potential of the form,\nU2 (\u03c6) = \u01eb2 (cos \u03c6 + 1/2)2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is value of the valent angle (equilibrium value\nof the angle \u03c60 = 2\u03c0/3), energy \u01eb2 = 1.3143 eV. Each\nvalent bond is simultaneously belong to two planes, so\nthat the deformation energy of the angle formed by two\nsuch planes can be described by the following interaction\npotential,\nUi (\u03c6) = \u01ebi (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c6 \u2013is the corresponding angle (in equilibrium, \u03c6 =\n0), and the index i = 3, 4, 5 describe the type of the\nvalent angle. Energy \u01eb3 = \u01eb4 = 0.499 eV, \u01eb5 \u226a \u01eb4 , so\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (a) General view of a cubic nanocluster composed of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 fullerene molecules C60 (buckyballs C60-Ih), (b) isolated\nmolecule C60 and (c) dimensionless density of its frequency spectrum for thermal vibrations at T = 3K.\n\nthat the latter contribution to the total energy can be\nneglected.\nMore detailed discussion and motivation of our choice\nof the interaction potentials U1 ,...,U4 can be found in\nRef. [6]. Such potentials have been employed for modeling of thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes [7, 8]\ngraphene nanoribbons [6, 10] and also in the analysis of\ntheir oscillatory modes [9, 11, 12].\nWe describe the interaction of carbon atoms belonging to different C60 molecules by the Lennard-Jones 12-6\npotential\nULJ (r) = 4\u01ebLJ [(\u03c3/r)12 \u2212 (\u03c3/r)6 ],\n\n(4)\n\nwhere r \u2013 distance between the atom centers, energy\n\u01ebLJ = 0.004556 eV, and parameter \u03c3 = 3.851 \u00c5.\nTo verify our results, we also employ the simpler model\nwhere all interacting potentials between the atoms are\ndescribed, instead of the set of the potentials U1 ,..., and\nU4 , by the Brenner potential [13].\nIII.\n\nINTRAMOLECULAR MODES\n\nThe high symmetry of an isolated, isotopically\npure C60 molecule in its equilibrium configuration\nimposes very strong constraints on the form of the\nnormal mode displacement patterns.\nAll 60 sites\nare symmetry-equivalent, and the point group is the\nfull icosahedral group Ih . Although there are 180\n\ndegrees of freedom (3\u00d760) for each C60 molecule,\nthe icosahedral symmetry gives rise to a number of\ndegenerate modes, so that only 46 distinct mode\nfrequencies are expected for the C60 molecule. All\nvibrational modes of C60 are distributed [14, 15] as\n2Ag +Au +4T1g +5T1u +4T3g +5T3u +6Gg +6Gu +8Hg +7Hu .\nDynamics of an isolated C60 fullerene molecule is described by a system of 3 \u00d7 60 nonlinear equations of the\nstandard form, M \u00fc = \u2212\u2202H/\u2202u, where M = 12 * 1.6603 *\n10\u221227 kg \u2013 mass of the carbon atom, system Hamiltonian is H = M (u\u0307, u\u0307)/2 + E(u), and 180-dimensional\nvector u = {(xn , yn , zn )}60\nn=1 defines the coordinates of all\natoms of the complex molecule. Potential energy of the\nmolecule E(u) is composed by all types of interactions\ndescribed by the potentials U1 ,...,U4 discussed above.\nTo find the equilibrium stationary state of the C60\nmolecule, we need to solve numerically the minimization\nproblem for the energy functional, E(u) \u2212\u2192 min. In the\nmodel under consideration, the molecule C60 is described\nby the set of coordinates u0 , and it has a shape of perfect\nicosahedral [see Fig. 1 (b)] with the radius R = 3.514 \u00c5,\nfor which all valent bonds have the equilibrium length\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 .\nLinearizing the model near the equilibrium stationary state, we obtain a system f linear equations M \u00fc =\nAu, where A is 180 \u00d7 180 dimensional matrix, A =\n{\u2202E/\u2202ui\u2202uj |u=u0 }180,180\ni=1,j=1 . Diagonalizing the matrix A\nwe find all 180 eigenmodes of the molecule. The first\nsix zero-frequency modes correspond to rigid translations\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: Values \u03c9 (in cm\u22121 ) for the 46 distinct normal mode frequencies of an isolated C60 molecule (n is mode degeneracy).\nNotations of the modes are from Ref.

Other 174 modes are generated and, in view of their degeneracy, there are exists\n46 distinct modes \u2013 see Table I.\nThe frequencies of all oscillatory eigenmodes of an\nisolated C60 molecule are summarized in Table I. All\nfrequency are located in the interval 162.1 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264\n1579.3 cm\u22121 . Definitely, the model with only 6 parameters is not able to predict exactly the frequencies obtained in the framework of the first principles calculations or experimental results, see [15]. Nevertheless, this\nmodel demonstrates a correct structure of the eigenmode\nfrequencies and predict rather well the frequency band\nmeasured experimentally, 272 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 1575 cm\u22121 .\nIt is important to mention that the use of the Brenner potentials [13] instead of the set of the potentials\nU1 ,...,U4 leads much broader frequency band, 182.9 \u2264\n\u03c9 \u2264 1738.9 cm\u22121 . In addition, the Brenner potential do not predict correctly the degeneracy of the frequency spectrum, so that the equilibrium shape of the\nC60 molecule deviates from the icosahedra shape.\nIn order to model thermal oscillations of the molecule,\nwe start from its equilibrium state and excite each of its\neigenmode with the energy kB T . The frequency spectrum of the C60 molecule at the temperature T = 3K is\nshown in the Fig. 1 (c). As expected, the spectrum is discrete, and the number of peaks coincides with the number of eigenmodes, whereas the peak positions coincide\nwith the corresponding eigenfrequencies. At low temperatures, the oscillations are linear, so that the spectrum\ncorresponds to a system of uncoupled linear oscillators.\nIf we increase the temperature to T = 30K, the discrete\nnature of the spectrum remains unchanged, but highfrequency modes demonstrate some energy exchange and\ninteraction. For much higher temperatures such as T =\n300K the discrete nature of the spectrum is lost and the\noscillations become strongly nonlinear demonstrating interaction with strong energy exchange.\n\nmode\nAu\nGu (4)\nT3u (3)\nHg (5)\nGg (4)\nHu (5)\nT1u (3)\nT3g (4)\nHg (6)\nT3u (4)\nHu (6)\nGu (5)\n\n\u03c9\n776.0\n847.7\n890.2\n1020.0\n1039.8\n1121.8\n1181.2\n1267.6\n1270.3\n1272.0\n1376.2\n1399.8\n\nIV.\n\nn\n1\n4\n3\n5\n4\n5\n3\n3\n5\n3\n5\n4\n\nmode\nGg (5)\nT1g (3)\nAg (2)\nT3u (5)\nT1u (4)\nHg (7)\nGu (6)\nGg (6)\nHu (7)\nHg (8)\n\n\u03c9\n1437.5\n1454.9\n1503.2\n1511.7\n1512.9\n1518.2\n1540.6\n1553.8\n1575.0\n1579.3\n\nn\n4\n3\n1\n3\n3\n5\n4\n4\n5\n5\n\nLOCALIZED NONLINEAR MODES\n\nThe C60 molecules occupy fcc sites in the solid phase,\nand at room temperature, the rapid rotational diffusion\nof each molecule leads to an effective fcc crystal structure.\nTo study localized modes of the fullerene molecule placed\nin a crystal, we consider a cubic nanocluster composed\nof 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 molecules C60 , as shown in Fig. 1 (a).\nFirst, we find the ground state of the nanocluster by\nminimizing its energy. Next, for the central molecule we\nexcite its n-th eigenmode (n = 7, ..., 180) with the energy E0 and study the decay of the kinetic energy in\nthe cluster. Due to the nonvalent coupling between the\nfullerenes, the energy is transferred from one molecule to\nanother. To model the energy spreading in an effectively\ninfinite crystal, we introduce lossy boundary conditions,\nwhen all surface molecules experience damping with the\nrelaxation time tr = 20 ps. If the excitation of the certain eigenmode lead to the creation of a localized state,\nor breathing-like mode, the kinetic energy will not vanish\nbut instead will approach a certain nonzero value. Otherwise, the initial excitation will vanish completely, so\nthat the kinetic energy of the central molecule Ek \u2192 0\nwhen t \u2192 \u221e.\nFirst, we excite with the energy E0 = 0.2 the nth mode (n = 7, ..., 180) of the central molecule of the\nfullerene crystal. Depending on the type of the modes,\nour numerical results reveal three different scenarios of\nthe mode relaxation, as shown in Fig. 2 (a-c). The first\nscenario is the rapid energy relaxation and decay of the\nmode oscillations (see curves 1, 4, and 7); the second scenario is slow relaxation (curves 2, 5, and 8), and the third\nscenario is the generation of stationary spatially localized\nnonlinear modes (curves 3, 6, and 9).\nThe first and second scenarios are observed for the\nmodes associated with a periodic change of the spherical\nshape or the size of the C60 molecule. The most interesting third scenario is observed for the modes associated\n\n\fEk (eV)\n\n4\n\n(a)\n\n0.1\n3\n\n0.05\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\nEk (eV)\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n0.1\n6\n5\n\n0.05\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n(c)\n\n0.1\n9\n\n0.04\n0.02\n3\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n(b)\n\n8\n\n2\n1\n\nx/hx\n\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\ny/hy\n\nE (eV)\n\n0.2\n\nEk (eV)\n\n0\n0\n\nFIG. 3: Selected eigenmodes of an isolated C60 molecule\nwhich lead to the generation of spatially localized nonlinear\nmodes (breathers) of the fullerene crystal.

For all those modes, the molecule\nconserves its spherical shape and therefore the resonant\ninteratomic interaction is reduced.\nFigure 4 shows the spatial distribution of the kinetic\nenergy of the nonlinear localized state generated by the\nexcitation of the eigenmode T3g (1). The main part of\nthe energy is concentrated at the central C60 molecule, so\nthis state resembles discrete breathers studied earlier for\nsimpler lattices. The nonlinear states generated by the\neigenmodes T1g (2) T1g (3) are localized even stronger.\nFor E > 0.01 eV, all such modes represent strongly anharmonic oscillations with the frequency decaying with\n\nFIG. 4:\nSpatial profile of the kinetic energy E of\nthe breathing-like nonlinear localized mode of the central\nfullerene molecule in the nanocluster of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 of C60\nmolecules in the planes (a) xy and (b) xz, intersecting the\ncentral molecule (shown by a black circle) For the generation\nof such breathers, the eigenmode T3g(1) was excited with the\nenergy E = 0.2 eV.\n\nthe mode amplitude. The mode T1g (2) carries the largest\namount of energy that can reach 1 eV.\nIt is important to mention that the model employing\nthe Brenner potentials predicts the existence of a larger\nnumber of localized modes.\nIn a thermalized nanocrystal all localized modes have a\nfinite life time. Their decay occurs mainly due to the interaction with other modes of the same molecule. Therefore, in order to define the lifetime of a nonlinear mode, it\nwould be sufficient to study the dynamics of an isolated\nC60 molecule with one strongly excited mode corresponding to the nonlinear localized state and all other modes\nweakly thermalized.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the interaction of one largeamplitude eigenmode T3g (1) with all other weakly thermalized eigenmodes of the fullerene C60 molecule. As follows from those results, the energy of the localized mode\ndecays monotonically exciting other modes. When the\ninitial energy of the T3g (1) mode is E1 = 0.2 eV and the\nenergy of all other modes is E0 = 0.002 eV, the localized\nmode loses a half of its energy for t0 = 1.4 ns, for E0 =\n0.004 eV \u2013this time is t0 = 0.8 ns, for E0 = 0.008 eV \u2013\nt0 = 0.4 ns, and for E0 = 0.016 eV \u2013 t0 = 0.1 ns.

Shown is the evolution of the energy\ndistribution over the frequencies. The peak corresponds to a\nlarge-amplitude mode (shown in red).\n\nfor t0 = 0.5 ns if E0 = 0.004 eV, for t0 = 0.3 ns if\nE0 = 0.008 eV, and for t0 = 0.1 ns if E0 = 0.016 eV.\nThe smallest lifetime is shown by the eigenmode T1g (3),\nwhich for the input energy E1 = 0.2 eV and E0 = 0.002\nlooses a half of its energy for t0 = 0.1 ns.\nTherefore, our numerical results demonstrate that in\na crystal formed by C60 molecules the spatially localized\nnonlinear modes are long-lived excitations, and at room\ntemperature their life time is of the order of several picoseconds.\nV.\n\nTHERMAL RELAXATION OF C60 CRYSTAL\n\nThe existence of long-lived nonlinear localized collective modes in the nanocluster of C60 fullerene molecules\nshould affect substantially their physical properties. If\nthe thermal energy can be concentrated for long time in\nsome localized spots, such a crystal is expected to demonstrate low thermal conductivity. To confirm this idea, we\nconsider thermal relaxation of a cubic nanocluster composed of 10 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 12 C60 molecules, as shown in Fig. 6.\nThe 180-dimensional vector unmk define the coordinates of the atoms of (n, m, k)-th molecule of the nanocluster (n = 1, ..., 10; m = 1, ..., 12; k = 1, ..., 12).\nFor thermalizing the nanocluster, we solve the system\nof Langevin equations\nM \u00fcnmk = \u2212\u2202H/\u2202unmk \u2212 \u0393M u\u0307nmk + \u039enmk ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u0393 = 1/tr is the Langevin collision frequency with\ntr = 0.1 ps being the corresponding particle relaxation\ntime, and \u039enmk = {\u03benmk,i }180\ni=1 is a 180-dimensional\nvector of Gaussian distributed stochastic forces describing the interaction of atom with the thermostat\nwith correlation functions h\u03ben1 m1 k1 ,i (t1 )\u03ben2 m2 k2 ,j (t2 )i =\n\nFIG. 6: Relaxation the thermal gradient \u2206T between the opposite sides of the cubic cluster of 10 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 12 fullerene C60\nmolecules with time t Left insert shows this dependence in the\nlog-scale, with a straight line corresponding to a power-law dependence, \u2206T \u223c t\u22121 . Right insert shows a cubic nanocluster\nwith an arrow indicating the heat flow. Dependencies 1 and\n4 correspond to the approximation of rigid molecules when\ntheir internal dynamics is neglected, whereas curves 2 and 5\nshow the results of the full molecular dynamics simulations.\nCurves 3 and 6 show the results for the model employing the\nBrenner potentials.\n\n2M \u0393kB Tn1 m1 k1 \u03b4n1 n2 \u03b4m1 m2 \u03b4k1 k2 \u03b4ij \u03b4(t2 \u2212 t1 ), Tnmk is the\ntemperature of the molecule with the site (n, m, k).\nTo obtain the initial thermalized state of the nanocluster we solve numerically the Langevin equations (5) with\nthe initial conditions corresponding to the equilibrium\nstate. We run the simulations for t = 10tr , and then\nswitch off the coupling with the thermostat, i.e. neglecting the last two terms in Eqs. (5), in order to study the\nthermal relaxation of the nanocluster.\nWe thermalize the nanocluster asymmetrically, to have\nonly one side heated to the temperature T = 500 K,\nwhereas keeping all other atoms at the temperature T =\n300K. To achieve this, we solve the system of Langevin\nequations at Tnmk = 500 K for the atoms with the index\nk = 1 but for all other atoms with the indices k = 2, ..., 12\nwe put Tnmk = 300 K. In this case, we achieve a temperature different of \u2206T = 200 K between the opposite\nsides of the C60 nanocube. As the next step, we study\nthe thermal relaxation of the temperature gradient.\nAs a result of thermal energy exchange between the\nfullerene molecules, temperature difference should decay\nmonotonically. The crystal of fullerene molecules C60\nhas a three-dimensional structure so it should obey the\nFourier law for thermal conductivity. Because time does\nnot enter the Fourier law, it does not allow to determine the temporal relaxation of the thermal gradient,\nfor which we should employ the well-know generalization known as Cattaneo-Vernotte (CV) law [16, 17]. In\nits one-dimensional version, this law can be formulated\nthrough the differential equations,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n~\n1+\u03c4\n~q = \u2212\u03ba\u2207T,\n(6)\n\u2202t\n\n\f6\nwhere \u03ba is the standard coefficient of the thermal conductivity and \u03c4 is the characteristic relaxation time of\nthe system. In according to Eq. (6), the temperature\ngradient \u2206T should decay in accord with an exponential\ndependence.\nDependence of the temperature gradient \u2206T vs. t is\nshown in Fig. 6. As follows from this dependence, the\ntemperature difference decays very slow, in accord with\nthe power-law dependence, so that it does not obey the\nCattaneo-Vernotte law. In order to understand the reason for such an anomalous thermal relaxation as well as\nthe role played by the internal dynamics of the molecules,\nwe replace the C60 molecules by rigid balls and solve the\nsame problem assuming that the molecules in the crystal interact between each other as structureless particles.\nOur numerical results show that in this approximation\nthe relaxation of the temperature difference \u2206T follows\nan exponential dependence, in accord with the CattaneoVernotte law. Therefore, the anomalously slow relaxation\ncan be attributed to the excitation of long-lived nonlinear\noscillations of the C60 nanocluster.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have applied the molecular-dynamics numerical\nsimulations to study the nonlinear dynamics and ther-\n\n[1] H.

We have revealed that such complex\nnanoclusters support a special type of strongly localized\nnonlinear modes resembling discrete breathers of simple\nnonlinear lattices. For such modes, the kinetic energy\nis localized primarily in the rotational modes of a single C60 molecule and it decays slowly inside the fullerene\nnanocrystal. Importantly, our results have demonstrated\nthat at room temperatures the lifetime of such nonlinear localized modes may exceed tens of picoseconds. The\nexistence of such long-lived localized nonlinear states in\nthe nanoclusters explains the anomalously slow thermal\nrelaxation observed in such structures when the temperature gradient decays in accord with the power but not exponential law, thus violating the Cattaneo-Vernotte law\nof thermal conductivity.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAlex Savin acknowledges a warm hospitality of the\nNonlinear Physics Center at the Australian National University, and he thanks the Joint Supercomputer Center\nof the Russian Academy of Sciences for the use of their\ncomputer facilities.
