The former\ndescribes at the quantum level basic processes involving particles and forces, while the latter\ndescribes at the classical level long-range gravitational forces. It is believed that both theories\nwill merge to form a complete quantum theory of gravity at some very high cut-off energy\nscale like the Planck-scale [1, 2].\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: elim@oddjob.uchicago.edu\n\n\f2\nThis cut-off scale marks the point where our old description of nature breaks down, and\nit is not inconceivable that one of the victims of this breakdown is Lorentz invariance. It\nis thus interesting to test the robustness of this symmetry at the highest energy scales\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nThe early universe provides such a laboratory to us. In this paper, we study the effects\nof such a fixed-norm, constant timelike Lorentz-Violating (LV) vector field (introduced in\n[12, 13, 14]) during inflation and its imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\nIn order to do this, we extend the background theory discussed in a companion paper [15]\ninto the regime of linear perturbations, investigating both the consistency of its quantum\nfield theory and its evolution in an inflationary universe.\nFurthermore, in the theory of inflation, very short distance quantum fluctuations are\n\"blown-up\" by the accelerated expansion, generating a spectrum of primordial super-Hubble\nsize fluctuations. Thus it is reasonable to ask whether the quantum perturbations of this\nvector field may undergo a similar procedure to leave us with a classical spectrum of perturbations. Combined with the fact that vector perturbations can source both B-type and E-type\npolarization modes [16], such a primordial spectrum of vector modes could conceivably leave\nstrong signatures on the CMB.\nThe question now becomes whether perturbations of this vector field will be frozen-out\nduring the inflationary epoch, akin to that of the inflaton and gravitational wave perturbations. As we will see in Section (VI), the answer to this question is no.\nNevertheless, while we are thwarted in our attempt to directly see this vector field, it does\nleave other more subtle effects on the CMB. We investigate these effects in Section (VII),\nwhere we show that the vector field modifies both the spin-0 \"scalar\" and spin-2 \"tensor\"\nperturbation spectrum in possibly detectable ways. It follows that the so-called inflationary\nconsistency relation [17] is also violated.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section (II), we state our theory and derive the\nbasic equations of motion. Since the unperturbed field is a constant, we consider its classical\nperturbations in Section (III). We then quantize this theory in Section (IV) to show that the\nquantum field theory has positive definite Hamiltonian and its excitations are not tachyonic\n\n\f3\nfor some suitable choices of the theory parameters. In Section (V), we put the field into\na Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe, and derive the basic linear order equations for the\nvector field. We put these equations to work in Section (VI), solving the linear order equations in a de-Sitter universe. In Section (VII), we add an inflaton field and then compute\nthe generated primordial perturbation spectra. Finally we conclude in Section (VIII).\n\nII.\n\nTHE EQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\nWe begin by deriving the basic equations of motion for the vector field theory. We will\nfollow the notation of [15], where a more careful derivation is presented. In this paper we\nset h\u0304 = c = 1; we call the gravitational constant that appear in the action G\u2217 , since as we\nhave shown in [15] it differs from the observed Newton's constant GN .\nThe action for the most general theory of a single fixed-length vector field whose derivatives are at most second order are given by Jacobson and Mattingly as [14]\nS=\n\nZ\n\n4\u221a\n\ndx\n\n1\nR + Lu\n\u2212g\n16\u03c0G\u2217\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nLu = \u2212\u03b21 \u2207\u03bc u\u03bd \u2207\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 \u03b22 (\u2207\u03bc u\u03bc )2 \u2212 \u03b23 \u2207\u03bc u\u03bd \u2207\u03bd u\u03bc + \u03bb[u\u03bc u\u03bc + m2 ].\n\n(2)\n\nHere the \u03b2i 's are dimensionless parameters of our theory, and \u03bb is a lagrange multiplier\nfield; the vector field itself has a dimension of mass. We have dropped all terms higher than\nquadratic order in u.\nAlthough this theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant, its always non-vanishing vacuum\nviolates Lorentz symmetry by picking out a dynamical frame at every point in spacetime.\nOne can say that it has spontaneously broken Lorentz symmetry [18]; since u\u03bc is nonvanishing, there is always a dynamically preferred frame picked out by the vector field at all\npoints in spacetime.\nTo see Lorentz-violating matter dynamics, in principle we need to couple this vector field\nto the matter action (see for example [19]). In this paper we are interested in its gravitational\neffects as a matter field.\n\n\f4\nThe equation of motion for \u03bb enforces the fixed time-like norm constraint\ng\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd = \u2212m2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nm being the squared norm of the vector field, while the equation of motion for the vector\nfield itself is\n\u2207\u03bc J \u03bc\u03bd = \u03bbu\u03bd .\n\n(4)\n\nJ \u03bc \u03bd \u2261 \u2212\u03b21 \u2207\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 \u03b22 \u2207\u03c1 u\u03c1 \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03b23 \u2207\u03bd u\u03bc .\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the \"current\" tensor\n\nBy multiplying Eqn.

Using this\nwe find that the stress-energy tensor for this theory is [14]\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = 2\u03b21 (\u2207\u03b1 u\u03bc \u2207\u03b2 u\u03bc \u2212 \u2207\u03bc u\u03b1 \u2207\u03bc u\u03b2 )\n\u22122[\u2207\u03bc (u(\u03b1 J \u03bc \u03b2) ) + \u2207\u03bc (u\u03bc J(\u03b1\u03b2) ) \u2212 \u2207\u03bc (u(\u03b1 J\u03b2) \u03bc )]\n\u22122m\u22122 u\u03bd \u2207\u03bc J \u03bc\u03bd u\u03b1 u\u03b2 + g\u03b1\u03b2 Lu .\nIII.\n\n(6)\n\nCLASSICAL PERTURBATIONS IN FLAT SPACE\n\nBefore we study the behaviour of the vector field in a cosmological setting, we first consider\nthe behaviour of this vector field in Minkowski space without gravity1 . Since the unperturbed\nvector field is a constant, we investigate the evolution of its perturbations. In particular we\nwant to put constraints on the parameters \u03b2i , by appealing to the physical properties of its\nperturbations both classically and quantum mechanically.\nOur goal in this section is to find the classical solutions to the equations of motions of the\nvector perturbations. Along the way, we derive the Lagrangian for the vector perturbations,\nwhich we will use in Section (IV) when we consider the quantum version of this theory.\nIn Minkowski space (with metric signature +2) without gravity, a solution to the equations\nof motion (3) and (4) is simply\nu\u03bc = (m, 0, 0, 0)\n1\n\nThis limit corresponds to the setting 16\u03c0G\u2217 \u03b2i m2 \u226a 1, see Section (VI D) below.\n\n(7)\n\n\f5\nand\n\u03bb = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nTo investigate its dynamics we proceed to linear order by perturbing u and \u03bb\nu\u03bc \u2212\u2192 \u016b\u03bc + v \u03bc , \u03bb \u2212\u2192 \u03bb\u0304 + \u03b4\u03bb.\n\n(9)\n\nWe insert these expansions back into the Lagrangian Eqn. (1), and expand to quadratic\norder\nLu \u2212\u2192 L\u016b + \u03b41 L + \u03b42 L\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b41 L and \u03b42 L contain terms of linear and quadratic order in v respectively. Setting\n\u03b41 L = 0 will recover the equations of motion for the background variables \u016b, while variation\nof the quadratic order Lagrangian with respect to the perturbed variables will give us the\nfirst order perturbation equations of motion [20].\nSince we are interested in the dynamics of the perturbations, we now focus on the\nquadratic order Lagrangian\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b42 L = 2 \u2212\u03b21 \u2202\u03bc v \u03bd \u2202 \u03bc v\u03bd \u2212 \u03b22 (\u2202\u03bc v \u03bc )2 \u2212 \u03b23 \u2202 \u03bc v \u03bd \u2202\u03bd v\u03bc + \u03b4\u03bb(\u016b\u03bc v\u03bc ) .\n\n(11)\n\nwhere we have used the background result \u03bb\u0304 = 0. The equation of motion for \u03b4\u03bb is\n\u016b\u03bc v\u03bc = 0,\n\n(12)\n\nand by recalling \u016b\u03bc = (m, 0, 0, 0), we obtain\nv 0 = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nThe vector field has no timelike perturbation; this follows from the fact that it is already\nconstant in that direction by the fixed norm constraint and our choice of ansatz for its\nsolution.\nSince \u03b4\u03bb is a lagrange multiplier, we can insert the result Eqn. (13) back into the Lagrangian Eqn. (11) to obtain\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b42 L = 2 \u03b21 v\u0307 2 \u2212 \u03b21 \u2202i v j \u2202 i vj \u2212 \u03b22 (\u2202i v i )2 \u2212 \u03b23 \u2202i v j \u2202j v i ,\n\n(14)\n\n\f6\nwhere the Roman indices run from 1 to 3 and overdot denotes derivative with respect to time\nt. It is now perfectly reasonable to vary this action with respect to v i to obtain its equation\nof motion, since it is already in a respectable representation of the SO(3) group. However,\nthis is a reducible representation, so under spatial rotations the components of the vector\nfield will transform into each other. Thus it is more illuminating if we first decompose v i\ninto its irreducible spin-0 and spin-1 components by\nvi \u2261 \u2202iV + N i\n\n(15)\n\nwhere V is a \"scalar\" potential and N i is the component transverse to \u2202 i V (i.e. \u2202i N i = 0).\nThere are two reasons we do this. Firstly it extracts out the real dynamical degrees of\nfreedom for the vector field, allowing us to quantize it separately. Secondly, we would like\nto consider its evolution in a cosmological setting, and decomposing them allows us to make\ncontact with current literature in cosmological perturbation theory2 .\nWith this decomposition, the Lagrangian can be written as a sum of two uncoupled pieces\nfor the spin-0 and spin-1 components. Defining Si \u2261 \u2202i V, it is\n\u03b42 L \u2261 L(0) + L(1)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\nh\n\nL(0) \u2261 2 \u03b21 \u1e60 2 \u2212 \u03b21 \u2202i S j \u2202 i Sj \u2212 \u03b22 (\u2202i S i )2 \u2212 \u03b23 \u2202i S j \u2202j S i\n\ni\n\n(17)\n\nis the spin-0 field Lagrangian, and\nh\n\nL(1) \u2261 2 \u03b21 \u1e44 2 \u2212 \u03b21 \u2202i N j \u2202 i Nj\n\ni\n\n(18)\n\nis the spin-1 field Lagrangian. Note that we have eliminated the cross terms between S i and\nN i , as well as the \u03b23 term for the spin-1 component via integration by parts.\n2\n\nWe often use the superscripts (0) , (1) and (2) to denote spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 fields and quantities\nassociated with them respectively. We have not seen spin-2 fields yet, but we will when we consider\ncosmological perturbations and gravity waves. In cosmological perturbation theory, these are often called\n\"scalar-type\", \"vector-type\" and \"tensor-type\" perturbations [21]. To avoid phraseological disasters like\n\"scalar perturbations of the vector\", we do not use this terminology though we will helpfully remind the\nreader once in a while.\n\n\f7\nWe now reap the first benefits of our diligence by computing the equations of motion.\nVarying the action with respect to S i and N i we get\nS\u0308i \u2212\n\n\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 2\n\u2202 Si = 0\n\u03b21\nN\u0308i \u2212 \u2202 2 Ni = 0\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nwhich are simply wave equations with plane wave solutions\n(0)\n\nS i (~k) \u221d e\u2212ics\n\nkt+i~\nk*~\nx\n~\n\nN i (~k) \u221d e\u2212ikt+ik*~x .\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nNote that the the spin-0 component has a propagation speed of\n2\nc(0)\n=\ns\n\n\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23\n\u03b21\n\n(23)\n\nwhile the spin-1 component propagates at the speed of light. If we insist that the spin-0\ncomponent does not propagate superluminally, then we obtain the following constraint:\n\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23\n\u2264 1.\n\u03b21\n\n(24)\n\nSince Lorentz invariance is being violated, it is not surprising that the massless spin-0\nfield Si may not propagate at the speed of light. Here we have imposed the condition that its\npropagation speed to be less than unity. Since we are already violating Lorentz symmetry,\none can argue that it could propagate faster than the speed of light. However if we allow for\nsuperluminal propagation of the fields, in a curved spacetime, the theory a priori does not\nexclude the possibility of the vector fields tilting in such a way that they can fit together to\nform a closed loop, leading to the unphysical flowing of energy around closed timelike curves.\n\nIV.\n\nQUANTUM PERTURBATIONS IN FLAT SPACE\n\nA cursory look at the Lagrangian Eqn. (14) tells us that if \u03b21 < 0, the sign of the kinetic\nenergy is wrong which potentially will lead to quantum pathologies. In this section we will\nquantize the fields and show that this is indeed the case, i.e. \u03b21 > 0 if we are to have a\npositive definite Hamiltonian for both spin-0 and spin-1 components.\n\n\f8\nThe bonus from this exercise is that we obtain a consistent way of choosing initial conditions for the vector field, a feature we will need when we put this vector field into an inflating\nuniverse in Section (VI).\n\nA.\n\nSpin-0\n\nWe begin by quantizing the spin-0 component.

In other words, we need \u03b21 > 0 for spin-0 states to have positive norm (i.e. non2\nghostlike). Since c(0)\n= (\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 )/\u03b21 \u2265 0 for the field to be non-tachyonic and stable,\ns\n\nwe also find that \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 \u2265 0.\nWe can check that our choice of sign for \u03b21 is the right one by computing the Hamiltonian\nH =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\ndx\n\n\u0014\n\n(0)  \u0307\n\u03c0\u0302i \u015c i\n\n= sgn(\u03b21 )\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2212L\n\n(0)\n\n\u0015\n\n(37)\nh\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\nd3 k(c(0)\ns k) a ~\nk a~\nk + a \u2212~\nk a\u2212~\nk + \u03b4(0)\n\nwhich clearly shows that \u03b21 > 0 for it to be positive definite.\n\nB.\n\ni\n\n(38)\n\nSpin-1\n\nThe quantization of the spin-1 component proceeds analogously to the spin-0 component;\nthere are just more indices to keep track of. As usual, we begin with the Lagrangian Eqn.\n(18)\nh\n\nL(1) = 2 \u03b21 \u1e44 2 \u2212 \u03b21 \u2202i N j \u2202 i Nj\nwhich has the conjugate momentum\n(1)\n\n\u03c0i\n\n\u2261\n\n\u2202L(1)\n= 4\u03b21 \u1e44i .\n\u2202 \u1e44 i\n\ni\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\n\f10\n(1)\n\nPromoting the variables into operators Ni \u2192 N\u0302i , \u03c0i\n\n(1)\n\n\u2192 \u03c0\u0302i , we expand them as a sum of\n\nladder operators and their associated mode functions\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n(\u00b11) (\u00b11)\n3\n\u2020\n\u2217 (\u00b11) \u2217(\u00b11)\nd\nk\na\nN\nY\n+\na\nN\nY\nN\u0302i =\n~\n~\ni\ni\n~\n~\nk k\nk k\nk\nk\n(2\u03c0)3/2\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n(\u00b11) (\u00b11)\n(1)\n3\n\u2020\n\u2217 (\u00b11) \u2217(\u00b11)\nd\nk\na\n\u1e44\nY\n+\na\n\u1e44\nY\n,\n\u03c0\u0302i = 4\u03b21\n~\n~\ni\ni\nk\nk\n~\n~\nk\nk\nk\nk\n(2\u03c0)3/2\nZ\n\n(\u00b11)\n\nwhere Y~k\n\ni\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nare the analogous Laplace-Beltrami eigenmodes for the spin-1 field. The ladder\n\noperators here are not the same operators from the spin-0 case; they act on a different\nHilbert space. We have dropped the superscripts\n\n(\u00b11)\n\non the ladder operators for the sake of\n\nsimplicty. The right hand side is summed over both \u00b11 modes. As spin-1 fields, we impose\nthe equal time commutation relations\n[N\u0302i (~x), N\u0302 j (~x\u2032 )] = 0\n\n(43)\n\n(1)\n\n[\u03c0\u0302i (~x), \u03c0\u0302 j (1) (~x\u2032 )] = 0\n\n(44)\n\n[N\u0302i (~x), \u03c0\u0302 j (1) (~x\u2032 )] = i\u03b4(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 )\u03b4ij\n\n(45)\n\non the operators.\nInserting the expansion Eqn. (41) into the equation of motion Eqn.

Here we have dropped the\ns\n\nnegative frequency term, and again normalizing it such that the ladder operator commutation\nrelations are normalized to unity, taking into account the fact that we sum over both \u00b11\nmodes in (41) and (42).\nUsing Eqn. (41) and Eqn. (42), we find that the ladder operators obey\n[a~k , a\u2020~k\u2032 ] = sgn(\u03b21 )\u03b4(~k \u2212 ~k\u2032 )\n\n(47)\n\n[a~k , a~k\u2032 ] = 0\n\n(48)\n\n[a\u2020 ~k , a\u2020~k\u2032 ] = 0\n\n(49)\n\n\f11\nso that, as in the spin-0 case, \u03b21 > 0 for the spin-1 field to have the right spin-statistics\nrelation.\nFinally, we can compute the Hamiltonian\nH =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\ndx\n\n\u0014\n\n(1)  \u0307\n\u03c0\u0302i N\u0302 i\n\n= sgn(\u03b21 )\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2212L\n\n(1)\n\n\u0015\n\nh\n\nd3 kk a\u2020~k a~k + a\u2020 \u2212~k a\u2212~k + \u03b4(0)\n\n(50)\ni\n\n(51)\n\nto show that \u03b21 > 0 for it to be positive definite.\nThus for the perturbations of the LV vector field to have a consistent, non-tachyonic\nquantum field theory, the values of \u03b2i are constrained; namely \u03b21 > 0, \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 \u2265 0 and\n(\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 )/\u03b21 \u2264 1. There is an additional constraint on \u03b2i that we will find when we\nconsider the propagation of gravity waves. We will summarize all the constraints on \u03b2i in\nSection (VI D) below.\n\nV.\n\nLV VECTOR FIELD PERTURBATIONS IN AN FRW UNIVERSE\n\nIn this section, we compute the equations of motion for the evolution of the vector field\nin a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, adding in the effect of gravity, which we have\nneglected in the last two sections. The reader may want to skip this section, and refer back\nto it for the equations.\nSince the vector field itself does not contribute any stress-energy tensor without the presence of other matter fields in the background [15], it is inevitable that we will have to include\nthe perturbation variables of these matter fields.\nThe exception here is that of an FRW universe with the vector field and a cosmological\nconstant. A cosmological constant contributes energy density to the stress-energy tensor in\nthe background which the vector field will track, but it has no perturbations of its own,\nallowing us to solve the vector-gravity theory analytically in Section (VI).\n\n\f12\nA.\n\nBackground Results and Perturbation Variables\n\nIn linear perturbation theory, the Einstein equation is split into background and perturbed\ncomponents, both which are solved separately :\n\u1e20\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0G\u2217 T\u0304\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b4G\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0G\u2217 \u03b4T\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(52)\n\nFor simplicity, we work with a spatially flat universe; its linearly perturbed FRW metric\nin conformal time is\nh\n\nds2 = a(\u03b7)2 \u2212(1 + 2\u03a6)d\u03b7 2 + Bi d\u03b7dxi + (\u03b3ij + 2\u03a8\u03b3ij + 2HT ij )dxi dxj\n\ni\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03a8, \u03a6, Bi and the traceless HT ij are the four metric perturbation variables. The\nconformal time \u03b7 runs from \u2212\u221e to 0. \u03b3ij is the flat spatial metric in 3 dimensions.\nWe have shown in a previous paper [15] that the background energy density and pressure of\nthe vector field precisely tracks those of other matter fields present in a Friedman-RobertsonWalker universe, the net effect being that the gravitational constant G\u2217 is rescaled as first\nnoted by [22]\nGc \u2261\n\nG\u2217\n1 + 8\u03c0G\u03b1\n\n(54)\n\nwhere we have defined\n\u03b1 \u2261 (\u03b21 + 3\u03b22 + \u03b23 )m2 .\n\n(55)\n\nIn the same paper, we have also shown that in the Newtonian limit the vector field similarly\nrescales the Newton's constant by\nGN \u2261\n\nG\u2217\n,\n1 + 8\u03c0G\u2217 \u03b4\n\n(56)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4 \u2261 \u2212\u03b21 m2 .\n\n(57)\n\nNote that since our experimental tests of the Newton's constant is done in the Newtonian\nlimit, GN is the value we actually measure. As we will see in Section (VI D) below, the\nconstraints on the theory parameters \u03b2i mean that\n\u03b1 \u2265 0\n\n(58)\n\n\u03b4 < 0.\n\n(59)\n\n\f13\nIn other words, the cosmological Newton's constant Gc is always smaller than the measured\nNewton's constant GN , except in the case where m = 0.\nThe background Friedmann equations are\n8\u03c0Gc 2\na \u03c1m\n3\n!\na\u2032\u2032\n4\u03c0Gc 2\n\u2212 H2 = \u2212\na (\u03c1m + pm )\na\n3\nH2 =\n\n(60)\n(61)\n\nwhere H \u2261 a\u2032 /a = aH while primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time \u03b7. \u03c1m\nand pm are the density and pressure respectively for all other matter fields present in the\nuniverse which we model as a perfect fluid\nm\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n= (\u03c1m + pm )n\u03bc n\u03bd + pm g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(62)\n\nn\u03bc is a unit timelike vector field representing the fluid four-velocity. These matter fields can\nbe dark matter, radiation, or some other exotic isotropic source.\nUsing the background result \u016b\u03bc = (m, 0, 0, 0) and the fact that the fixed norm Eqn. (3)\nconstrains the total length of the vector (\u016b+v)2 = \u2212m2 , we find that the timelike component\nof the vector perturbation is proportional to \u03a6:\nv0 = \u2212\n\nm\n\u03a6;\na\n\n(63)\n\ni.e. as in the flat space no-gravity case in the earlier two sections, we only have three spatial\ndynamical degrees of freedom. For computational convenience, we write them as co-moving\ndimensionless variables V i ,\nvi \u2261\n\nm i\nV .\na\n\n(64)\n\nWe then insist that the spatial indices on V i , like those on the shift perturbation B i , are to\nbe raised and lowered using the spatial metric \u03b3ij\nVi \u2261 \u03b3ij V j = V i , Bi \u2261 \u03b3ij B j = B i .\n\n(65)\n\nNote that this definition means that the original vector perturbation obeys vi = ma(Vi \u2212Bi ).\n\n\f14\nB.\n\nThe Bardeen Decomposition\n\nIn an FRW background which is spatially homogenous and isotropic, the perturbation\nvariables can be decomposed into spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 components [23]. If further,\nthe background matter fields themselves do not break spatial SO(3) symmetry, the great\nadvantage of this decomposition is that each of the components are decoupled from one\nanother, thus allowing us to solve for them separately. Fortunately, this is indeed the case\nin our theory, since the background vector field \u016b\u03bc only has timelike components (unlike the\ncase in [24], for example).\nIn this section, we will write down the equations for each component. The equations here\nmay seem daunting, but they are straightforward to derive: just insert the perturbed metric\n(53) and vector field u\u03bc into equations (4) and (6) from Section (II) and then keep all terms\nto linear order. The mode equations for the Einstein tensor can be found in the literature\n[21] so we will not list them here.

One key\nto its success is that it provides a mechanism for consistently choosing initial conditions to\n\n\f17\nproduce a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations that eventually will grow\ninto galaxies and things like human beings [26].\nThis mechanism is based on the idea that quantum fluctuations in a near de-Sitter background can be \"blown up\" in their amplitude such that they become classical perturbations\nafter they cross the Hubble radius. Thus, the initial conditions for the perturbations are\nquantum mechanical in nature; one chooses a suitable vacuum for the initially quantum field\nwhen the physical length of the mode is very small, and then follows the evolution of this\nmode until it freezes out. The classical amplitude of this mode is then given to us by the\n2-pt correlation function of the quantum field [20].\nIn general, inflation is driven by some dynamical field called the inflaton; in the usual case\nit is a scalar field. The inflaton itself has perturbations, so a coupled vector-inflaton-gravity\ntheory is not easily solved. Before we do that in the next section, as a warm up we tackle the\nsimpler case of inflation driven by a cosmological constant, which has no perturbations. In\nthis case, the vector-gravity perturbation equations are analytically solvable in closed form.\nThe solutions to the various equations are straightforward, though it takes some algebraic\nmanipulation to write them in a useful form; here we sketch the derivation. One can of course\nskip them and just look right ahead at the solution in Eqns. (82), (89) and (98). We will\nturn the order around this time and compute the solutions for spin-2 perturbations first,\nbefore finishing with the spin-1 and spin-0 perturbation solutions.\n\nA.\n\nEvolution of spin-2 perturbations in de-Sitter space\n\nAlthough the LV vector field has no spin-2 component, as we have shown in Section (V)\nit has a non-zero stress-energy tensor; its very presence will modify the evolution of gravity\nwaves.\nSpin-2 equations are gauge invariant3 . By using the i \u2212 j component of the Einstein\n3\n\nSince gauge transformations are generated by diffeomorphisms which in turn are generated by a vector\nfield, this means that there are no spin-2 gauge transformations.\n\n\f18\nequation, we obtain the equation of motion for the spin-2 gravity wave modes\nHT\u2032\u2032 (\u00b12) + 2HHT\u2032 (\u00b12) +\n\nk2\n(\u00b12)\nH\n=0\n1\u2212\u03b3 T\n\n\u03b3 \u2261 16\u03c0G\u2217 m2 (\u03b21 + \u03b23 )\n\n(82)\n(83)\n\nwhich is the same equation for propagation of gravity waves in de-Sitter space without the\nvector field except that the propagation speed has been rescaled\n2\nc(2)\n=\ns\n\n1\n.\n1\u2212\u03b3\n\n(84)\n\nThis gives us an extra constraint that \u03b21 + \u03b23 \u2264 0 if they are not to propagate faster than\nthe speed of light. We can understand this by realizing the the vector field has changed the\npermeability of \"empty space\". This was first noted by the authors of [14] in a Minkowski\nspace setting, whose results for the propagation speeds we also recover for spin-0 and spin-1\nfields in the following sections (by setting a = constant). Note that their \"small ci \" limit\ncorresponds to 16\u03c0G\u2217 \u03b2i m2 \u226a 1 here.\n\nSince gravity wave perturbations freeze out at the sound horizon c(2)\ns k\u03b7 = 1, they will\n\nfreeze out earlier compared to the usual case of k\u03b7 = 1, leading to a modification of the\namplitude of the spectrum. We leave the computation of this spectrum to Section (VII).\n\nB.\n\nEvolution of spin-1 perturbations in de-Sitter space\n\nUnlike the spin-2 equations, the spin-1 Einstein equation has two gauge degrees of freedom, and one can use this freedom to simplify the equations somewhat. Following [16], we\nchoose\n(\u00b11)\n\nHT\n\n=0\n\n(85)\n\ni.e. we consider the perturbations on hypersurfaces that are shear-free.\nThe spin-1 i \u2212 j component of the Einstein equation gives us the constraint between the\n\nshift B (1) and the spin-1 perturbation V (1) ,\n\nB (\u00b11) = \u03b3V (\u00b11) .\n\n(86)\n\n\f19\nInserting this into 0 \u2212 i component of the Einstein equation results in\n\"\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n2 2 H2 \u2212 2\nm\nm\n\"\n1\n+ (\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b23 ) +\n2\n\na\u2032\u2032\na\u2032\u2032\n+ \u03b21\nV (\u00b11) +\na\na\n#\n\u03b21 + \u03b23 2 (\u00b11)\nk V\n+ \u03b21 (2HV (\u00b11)\u2032 + V (\u00b11)\u2032\u2032 ) = 0,\n1\u2212\u03b3\n!\n\n!#\n\n(87)\n\nwhich after defining\n\u03be (\u00b11) \u2261 aV (\u00b11) ,\nbecomes\n\u03be\n\n(\u00b11)\u2032\u2032\n\n\"\n\n(88)\n\n#\n\n1 + \u03b23 /\u03b21 2 (\u00b11)\n\u03b1\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b23 /\u03b21 ) +\nk \u03be\n+ A 2 \u03be (\u00b11) = 0.\n+\n2\n1\u2212\u03b3\nm \u03b21\n\n(89)\n\nHere we have defined the useful background quantity\na\u2032\u2032\nA \u2261 2H \u2212\na\n\"\n\n2\n\n!#\n\n\u0014\n\n= 4\u03c0Gc a2\n\n\u03c1m + pm\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(90)\n\nusing the Friedman equations (60) and (61).\nIn de-Sitter space the pressure of the cosmological constant is equal to minus the energy\ndensity, pm = \u2212\u03c1m , so that A = 0; thus the last term in Eqn. (89) vanishes leaving us with\n\nan oscillatory solution for \u03be (\u00b11) .

This matching is reasonable because at very short wavelengths where\npresumably when these modes are \"created\", they do not see the large-scale curvature of\nspace time. In this case, we can make this matching when (a(\u03b70 )/k)/H \u22121 \u226a 1 where H \u22121\nis the de-Sitter radius (or the scale of inflation in a near de-Sitter cosmology). The vector\nnorm m is there because we have factored it out in our change of variables in Eqn. (64).\n\n\f20\nNotice that the propagation speed here is not unity as in the flat space case: the presence\nof gravity has changed the value somewhat (although the condition \u03b21 + \u03b23 \u2264 0 implied\n\n2\nthat c(\u00b11)\n\u2264 1). This is due to the fact that the vector field is no longer propagating\ns\n\nthrough \"vacuum\", but instead has to traverse through a \"medium\" of backreacting metric\nperturbations; one can check this by turning off gravity (setting G\u2217 = 0) and recovering\nc2s (\u00b11) = 1. (See also [14].)\nThe spin-1 component of the shift perturbation B (\u00b11) sources both E-type and B-type\npolarization anisotropies of the CMB, the latter dominating the former by a factor of 6\n[16]. Thus the quantity of interest that we want to compute is the spectrum of spin-1\nperturbations, given by the two point correlation function\nh0|B (\u00b11) (~x)B (\u00b11) (~x + ~r)|0i = \u03b3 2\n\nZ\n\ndk sin(kr) 1 3 (\u00b11) 2\nk |V\n|.\nk kr 2\u03c0 2\n\n(93)\n\nBut since V (\u00b11) \u221d a\u22121 and a grows exponentially in de-Sitter space, V (\u00b11) can only decay.\nUnlike the inflaton, the vector field does not freeze out, leaving us with nothing but a bunch\nof complicated equations. In addition, if the inflaton field is a scalar field which contributes\nno spin-1 perturbations, this result is general: scalar field driven inflation with a fixed-norm\nLV vector field does not generate a spin-1 spectrum of perturbations.\nIn fact after the end of inflation, the first term in Eqn. (89) will decay as a\u22121 and a\u22122 in\nmatter and radiation dominated eras respectively, leaving our oscillatory solution for \u03be (\u00b11)\nunchanged thus even if these modes are created during the CMB era they will decay away 4 .\nThus we have shown that the vector field cannot source spin-1 type perturbations, and\ntherefore will not generate B-type polarization modes in the CMB.\n\nC.\n\nEvolution of spin-0 perturbations in de-Sitter space\n\nAnalogous to the spin-1 equations, the spin-0 equations have two gauge degrees of freedom,\nwhich we fix by choosing\n(0)\n\nB (0) = 0 , HT = 0\n4\n\n(94)\n\nThis is technically only true for the usual CMB fluids such as photons, baryons and dark matter. If we\nhave other vector sources, the evolution of V (\u00b11) will be non-trivial.\n\n\f21\nwhich is sometimes called the newtonian gauge or longitudinal gauge.\nUsing the off-diagonal term of the i \u2212 j Einstein equation, we obtain the constraint\nk 2 (\u03a6 + \u03a8) = \u03b3a\u22122 (a2 kV (0) )\u2032 ,\n\n(95)\n\nwhich we can then plug into the 0 \u2212 i component to obtain\n\u03be (0)\u2032\u2032\n1\n2\n(\u221216\u03c0G\nm\n\u03b2\n+\n2\u03b3)\na (ak\u03a6) =\n\u2217\n1\n2 \u2212 16\u03c0G\u2217 m2 \u03b21\na\n\u22121\n\n(\n\n\u2032\n\na\u2032\u2032\n\u2212(2\u03b3 + 16\u03c0G\u2217 \u03b1) 2H \u2212\na\n\"\n\n2\n\n!#\n\n\u03be (0)\na\n\n)\n\n(96)\n\nwhere we have similarly defined\n\u03be (0) \u2261 aV (0) .\n\n(97)\n\nInserting this result into the space component of the equation of motion Eqn.

However, in the\nradiation and matter dominated eras, the spin-0 equation of motion no longer behaves like\nEqn. (98) since it will couple via gravity to spin-0 perturbations of the other fluids, leading\nto complicated coupled equations which cannot be solved analytically in general.\n\nD.\n\nWhat are the allowed values for \u03b2i ?\n\nBefore we proceed to the next Section, let us summarize our findings on the constraints\non the theory parameters \u03b2i :\n1.

These constraints form an infinite length\nwedge in the parameter space spanned by (\u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 ) as shown in Fig. (1).\nThe above conditions imply that the background energy density of the vector field in an\nFRW background\n\u03c1u = \u22123\u03b1H 2 = \u22123(\u03b21 + 3\u03b22 + \u03b23 )m2 H 2 \u2264 0\n\n(103)\n\nis non-positive since \u03b1 \u2265 0. As discussed in the a companion paper [15], this is not a\ndisaster since the background vector has no dynamical degrees of freedom. This is akin to\nthe negative energy density of a negative cosmological constant. As shown in the previous\nsection, for suitable choices of the parameters \u03b2i , the quantum field theory of the propagating\nperturbative degrees of freedom is perfectly consistent.\n\n\f23\n\u03b21\n\n\u03b23\n\n\u03b22\n\n\u03b22+\u03b23=0\n\nFIG. 1: Figure showing the allowed values for \u03b2i .

An example of a valid choice\nof parameters is \u03b21 = 1, \u03b22 = 2.5, \u03b23 = \u22123.\n\nWe note here that the conditions above are valid in the regime where 16\u03c0G\u2217 \u03b2i m2 \u226a 1; we\ncan understand this by noting that in this regime the energy density of vector field becomes\nsmall and thus the geometry of spacetime approaches that of Minkowski where we have\nderived our constraints. While we have shown above that the various propagation speeds\nare still subluminal in a de-Sitter background, there is no guarantee that this would be true\nin general. Indeed outside this regime, the modes may become tachyonic5\n\nVII.\n\nLV VECTOR FIELDS IN INFLATION\n\nOne can try to understand the previous section by analogy to the exact tracker solution of\nthe background vector field: the perturbations need to track something. If the background\nhas no matter fields and thus is Minkowski, the stress-energy of the vector field vanishes\nidentically. Similarly, in the absence of other matter perturbations; the vector field perturbations follow the behaviour of metric perturbations, which in de-Sitter spacetime have been\n5\n\nWe thank Ted Jacobson for pointing this out to us.\n\n\f24\nshown to exponentially decay [27].\nIt then follows that if we drive inflation with an inflaton instead of just a plain cosmological\nconstant, the vector field might track the evolution of the inflaton perturbations, preventing\nit from decaying away. In this section, we investigate this possibility.\nThe simplest models of inflation are those driven by a slowly-rolling scalar field (see for\nexample [28]). Unfortunately, unlike the previous section, the equations become intractable\nto solve in exact closed form. Nevertheless, in Section (VII A), we derive approximate solutions for the evolution of the metric perturbation \u03a6. We find that, like its background\ncounterpart, the inflaton perturbation acts as a source for the vector field, preventing it\nfrom decaying away.\nWe end our investigation into observability of LV vector fields by computing both primordial spectra for the density perturbation and the gravitational wave spectrum in Section\n(VII B), showing that both spectra are modified from the usual values in potentially detectable ways.\n\nA.\n\nApproximate solution to the Metric Perturbation \u03a6\n\nThe observed spectrum of temperature anisotropies in the CMB [29] is given by the two\npoint correlation function of the density perturbation \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 at the time of recombination.\nThe density perturbation itself is sourced by a spectrum of metric perturbation \u03a6 modes,\nwhich remain constant until they enter the Hubble radius, at which point they oscillate to\ngenerate the observed features.\nThus it is of interest to us to investigate the evolution and the eventual large scale solution\nto \u03a6. In this section, we derive the approximate solutions to \u03a6, and then in the next section\nwe use these solutions to calculate the spectrum of perturbations generated by inflation with\nthe presence of the vector field.\nWe note in passing that since the inflaton field is a scalar, it sources no spin-1 type\nperturbations and thus the spin-1 perturbation evolves exactly as in the previous section.\nSince we are considering only spin-0 quantities here, we drop the\n\n(0)\n\nsuperscript.\n\n\f25\nConsider a scalar field theory acting as the inflaton\nS\u03c6 =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u221a\nd x g \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u1e7c (\u03c6) .\n2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n4\n\n(104)\n\nThe exact form of \u1e7c (\u03c6) is not important in what we are considering; suffice to say that it is\nalmost flat (see for example [30]).

One can check that by setting\n\nm2 = 0, we recover the usual relation for the power spectrum (134) where P\u03a6 /P\u0304\u03a6 = 1. Note\n\nthat the index of the power spectrum does not change since vector field background precisely\ntracks that of the inflaton.\nAs an aside, we comment on the use of the relation \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c H above. One can argue\nthat there is no reason to believe that the inflaton perturbation at small scales will evolve\nsimilarly to the usual no-vector-field case. However, since there is no direct coupling between\nthe inflaton and the vector field, any effects that the inflaton perturbation will experience\ndue to the vector field has to be through the metric perturbation which is at most a second\norder effect.\nThis rescaling of the spin-0 amplitude is degenerate with the slow-roll parameter \u01eb, thus\nfrom the standpoint of the spin-0 perturbation alone we cannot disentangle them. Nevertheless, there is hope for us to distinguish between them if we can observe the gravitational\nwave spectrum, as we will see later.\nFrom Eqn. (82) and following [33], we can then compute the power spectrum for spin-2\n\"tensor\" perturbations to be\nq\n\nPH (2) = 8\u03c0G\u2217 1 \u2212 \u03b3\nT\n\n7\n\nH2\n.\nk3\n\n(137)\n\nWe have used the potential-independent definition of the slow-roll parameter. See [30] for a discussion on\nthe difference between this parameter and the \u1e7c dependent definition \u01eb = (16\u03c0G\u2217 )\u22121 ((\u2202 \u1e7c /\u2202 \u03c6\u0304)/\u1e7c )2 .\n\n\f31\nSince for non-superluminal propagation of the gravity waves we need \u03b3 < 0, the spin-2\n\"tensor\" power spectrum is boosted, making the tensor spectrum possibly more accessible\nto observations (currently we have no detection of a spin-2 spectrum [34]). Of course, this\nvalue is degenerate with the Hubble parameter H so measurement of the spin-2 spectrum\ndoes not allow us to put a constraint on the LV vector field parameters.\nIf we assume natural O(\u22121) values for \u03b21 + \u03b23 , then \u03b3 \u2248 (m/mp )2 where m2p = 1/(8\u03c0GN ).\nThus if m is of order mp which is to say that Lorentz-violating effects are a symptom of new\nPlanck scale physics, then there will be a boost in our chances at observability of gravity\nwaves in the CMB. However, as shown in [15], primordial nucleosynthesis constraints m to\nbe an order of magnitude smaller than mp .\nBefore we close our investigation of LV vector fields in an inflationary universe, we note\nthat the presence of this vector field has violated the so-called inflationary consistency relation. One can show that any single slow-roll scalar field model of inflation with slow-roll\nparameter \u01eb, the spectral index for the spin-2 spectrum nT = \u22122\u01eb. But the ratio of the\namplitudes for the spin-2 and spin-0 spectra is proportional to \u01eb, so this relation states that\nPH (2)\nT\n\nP\u03a6\n\n9\n= \u2212 nT .\n2\n\n(138)\n\nBut here, with the vector field permeating the universe, from Eqns. (134) and (137) we\nobtain the modified relation\nPH (2)\nT\n\nP\u03a6\n\n=\u2212\n\n9 (1 + 8\u03c0G\u03b1)(1 \u2212 \u03b3)3/2\nnT .\n2 [1 + \u03b3\u03b1/(\u03b21 m2 )]2\n\n(139)\n\nIn other words, if we believe in the single slow-roll scalar field model of inflation, then\nmeasuring nT will allow us to put a constraint on the parameters of the theory.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that perturbations of a fixed-norm, timelike vector field have a consistent\nquantum theory. If we insist on positivity of the Hamiltonian and non-tachyonic propagation\nof the quantized field, then we find that \u03b21 > 0 for the former and \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 \u2265 0 for\nthe latter. In addition, non-superluminal propagation of the spin-0 field and gravity waves\n\n\f32\nrequires that (\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 )/\u03b21 \u2264 1 and \u03b21 + \u03b23 \u2264 0 respectively. These facts imply that the\nsign of the background energy density of the vector field is non-positive.\nWe then considered the evolution of the vector perturbations in a FRW universe. Specializing to a de-Sitter spacetime, we find that the perturbations decay away exponentially.\nWe argued that this is because there is no other matter perturbations for the vector field to\ntrack.\nFollowing that, we investigated its evolution in the presence of an inflaton field. As\nexpected, the vector perturbation is now sourced by the inflaton perturbation, making it\nnon-decaying and thus imparting non-trivial effects on the metric perturbations. We derived\nthe generated primordial spectrum for both spin-0 (approximately) and spin-2 (exactly)\nperturbations, and showed that their amplitude is rescaled. In particular, we noted that\nif the norm m of the vector field is large enough, it might lead to a boosted spectrum of\nB-mode polarization in CMB. We also showed that the presence of the vector perturbations\nalso violates the inflationary consistency relation.\nFinally, the ultimate test of the observability of LV vector field induced modifications in\nthe CMB lies in our ability to compute the evolution of perturbations from Hubble reentry\nthrough to the surface of last scattering. This entails solving the multicomponent Boltzmann\nevolution equations, adding the vector perturbation on top of the usual photon-baryon-dark\nmatter fluid, an endeavour that can only be done numerically.\n\nIX.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author would like to thank Christian Armendariz-Picon, Jim Chisholm, Scott Dodelson, Vikram Duvvuri, Christopher Eling, Christopher Gordon, Stefan Hollands, Wayne\nHu, Ted Jacobson, Rocky Kolb, Alan Kostelecky, David Mattingly, Takemi Okamoto, Clem\nPryke, Eduardo Rozo, Robert Wald and especially Sean Carroll for useful and insightful\ndiscussions.

This formalism was first applied to cosmological perturbations by Bardeen [23]. We\npresent a short review in this appendix for completeness and also to pin down conventions,\nspecializing to a spatially flat universe. For a good comprehensive review, see [21].\nIn a background FRW spacetime that is foliated into spatial hypersurfaces labeled by\ncosmic time, the linear perturbations are just functions living in a spatially SO(3) and translationally invariant background. If further, there are no background quantities that violate\nthis symmetry (e.g. a background vector field with spatial components or an inhomogenous\nscalar field), the perturbation variables decomposed using these eigenmodes are decoupled\nfrom each other.\nThe spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 orthonormal modes are eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator\n\u2202 2 Y (0) + k 2 Y (0) = 0\n(\u00b11)\n\n+ k 2 Yi\n\n(\u00b12)\n\n+ k 2 Yij\n\n\u2202 2 Yi\n\n\u2202 2 Yij\n\n(A1)\n\n(\u00b11)\n\n= 0\n\n(A2)\n\n(\u00b12)\n\n= 0.\n\n(A3)\n\nThese modes obey the following conditions\n\u2202i Y i(\u00b11) = 0 , \u2202i Y ij (\u00b12) , Yii (\u00b12) = 0\n\n(A4)\n\ni.e. spin-1 modes are divergenceless, and the spin-2 modes are traceless and transverse.
