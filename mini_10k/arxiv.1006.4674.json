This enables preparation of isolated spin distributions at positive and\nnegative effective spin temperatures of \u00b150 picokelvin. The spin system can also be used to cool\nother degrees of freedom, and we have used this coupling to cool an apparently equilibrated Mott\ninsulator of rubidium atoms to 350 picokelvin. These are the lowest temperatures ever measured in\nany system. The entropy of the spin mixture is in the regime where magnetic ordering is expected.\nPACS numbers: 37.10.Jk, 37.10.De, 75.30.Sg, 75.10.Jm\n\nAttainment of lower temperatures has often enabled\ndiscovery of new phenomena, from superconductivity to\nBose-Einstein condensation. Currently, there is much interest in the possibility of observing correlated magnetic\nquantum phases in lattice-trapped ultracold atoms [1\u20133].\nThe relevant critical temperatures are on the order of 200\npicokelvin, lower than any previously achieved temperature [4, 5]. Realization of this temperature scale requires\nthe development of new methods of refrigeration which\ncan be applied to ultracold atoms. Many such techniques\nhave been proposed [6\u201313] but await experimental realization. The cooling method we demonstrate here opens\nup a previously inaccessible temperature regime and provides a realistic path to the observation of magnetic quantum phase transitions in optical lattices.\nThe new cooling method is applied to an optically\ntrapped cloud of cold atoms in a mixture of two internal\nstates with different magnetic moments [14]. Application\nof a strong magnetic field gradient results in almost complete spatial segregation of the two spin components. The\n\"mixed region\" of spins between the pure-spin domains\nhas a width which is proportional to the temperature T\nand inversely proportional to the applied gradient. Reducing the gradient mixes the two components, and due\nto the mixing entropy the temperature is dramatically\nreduced. Since Mott insulators can be prepared with an\nentropy per particle much lower than kB ln 2, our scheme\nis a practical way of creating a low entropy mixture in the\nregime where magnetic ordering is expected. This cooling\nscheme introduces several new concepts. It implements\ndemagnetization cooling with spin transport instead of\nspin flips, allows decoupling of the spin and kinetic temperatures, and enables the realization of negative spin\ntemperatures. Long tunneling times in the lattice allow\ntwo different implementations of our cooling scheme.\nWhen the gradient is changed faster than the spin relaxation rate, the spin system is effectively isolated from\nall other degrees of freedom, and very low spin temperatures can be achieved. Contrastingly, when the gradient\nis changed slowly enough, the spin system is fully equilibrated and can absorb entropy from other degrees of\nfreedom, cooling the whole sample. Reduction of the\n\nFIG. 1: Two different cooling protocols realizing the cases\nof isolated and equilibrated spin systems. a: Experimental \"phase diagram\" of lattice depth vs. applied gradient.\nDashed lines show two different paths which connect the highgradient superfluid state and the low-gradient Mott insulating state. b: and c: show the lattice depth (solid line) and\ngradient strength (dashed line) versus time for the two cases\n(equilibrated spins and isolated spins, respectively) in panel\na. The shape of the lattice rampup is designed to ensure\nmaximum equilibration.\n\ngradient after (before) the optical lattice has been raised\nrealizes the regime of isolated (equilibrated) spins.\nFirst, we discuss isolated spins, of which atoms in a\nMott insulating state are an almost ideal realization.\nSpin distributions relax by two atoms exchanging sites\nthrough a second order tunneling process. The time scale\nof this relaxation is typically one second, and the gradient can easily be varied much faster. The equilibrium\nspin distribution depends only on the ratio of the applied gradient \u2207|B| and temperature T . When \u2207|B| is\nchanged the effective temperature of the decoupled spin\ndegrees of freedom (spin temperature) is rescaled proportionally. This enables the realization of spin distributions with a very low positive (or, if the sign of the gradient is changed, negative) effective temperature. Negative temperatures can only occur for systems with an upper bound on the energy, and correspond to an inverted\nBoltzmann distribution with the largest population in\nthe highest-energy state [15].\nFigure 2 shows the results of experiments on isolated\nspins. Fits to data on equilibrated spins indicate an ini-\n\n\f2\ntial temperature of 6.3 nanokelvin (see Figs. 3 and 4).\nWhile reduction of the gradient by a factor of 1000 would\nbe expected to reduce the effective temperature of the\nisolated spins to 6.3 picokelvin, our finite optical resolution only allows us to assert an upper bound of 50\u00b120\npicokelvin. We have held the spins for up to several\nseconds in the lattice. No heating is observed during\na one-second hold, but after three seconds the 50 picokelvin distribution is observed to heat to about 70\npicoKelvin. Similarly, at small negative gradients, we\nobserve a negative-temperature distribution with a temperature closer to zero than -50\u00b120 picokelvin. Since the\ntotal energy is monotonic in \u22121/T , these are among the\nmost extreme thermodynamic states ever measured in\nany system [16, 17]. Very low condensate release energies\n(not temperatures) have been observed previously [18].\nNote that the spin temperatures we report are much\nlower than those attainable by magnetic trapping or optically pumping a system into a single spin state: even for a\nfractional population of 10\u22126 in other spin states caused\nby imperfect pumping or spin-flip collisions [19], the spin\ntemperature in a bias field of 100 mG is 500 nanokelvin,\nassuming a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. In\nour experiment, the energy scale is set by the product of\nthe Bohr magneton with the magnetic field gradient and\nthe lattice spacing, and it is the relative ease of achieving\nvery small values of this parameter (corresponding to \u03bcB\ntimes a field of less than one microgauss) which allows us\nto reach such low spin temperatures.\n\nFIG. 2: Preparation of low positive and negative spin temperatures. Measured spin temperature versus final gradient,\nfor the case of isolated spins. Error bars are statistical.\n\nThe mixed-spin region comprises a spectrum of spin\nexcitations, the energy of which can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the gradient [20]. A spin excitation\nconsists of a spin-up atom swapping places with a spindown atom on the other side of the zero-temperature spin\ndomain boundary. Reduction of the gradient reduces the\nenergy of spin excitations. In the regime of equilibrated\nspins, this causes entropy to flow into the mixed-spin region from other degrees of freedom. This lowers the temperature of the whole system in a manner locally analogous to standard single-shot adiabatic demagnetization\n\nrefrigeration [21, 22]. The kinetic excitations of a trapped\nMott insulator are particle-hole excitations [4, 23]. On\na microscopic level, particle-hole excitations can couple\ndirectly to spin excitations if a particle and a hole on\nopposite sides of the spin domain boundary annihilate.\nEnergy may be absorbed by quasiparticles in the first\nband or by the spin excitations themselves [24]. In the\nsuperfluid phase and during lattice rampup, the kinetic\nexcitations are different and entropy transfer is expected\nto occur faster and in more complex ways. Experimentally, it is easier to maintain adiabaticity if most of the\npath along which the gradient is changed is in a regime\nof fast relaxation times (e.g. the lower path in Fig. 1a).\nThermodynamically, this adiabatic cooling method is a\nredistribution of entropy from the kinetic degrees of freedom to the entropy which results from partially mixing\nthe two initially segregated spin domains.\nIt is easily possible for the mixed region to absorb\nnearly all of the entropy of the system. In a onecomponent harmonically trapped Mott insulator which\nis at a temperature low enough for the particle-hole approximation to hold, the approximate total entropy is\nkB ln(2) times the volume of the \"shells\" between the\nMott plateaux [4]. The maximum entropy of the the\nmixed region is realized when, at low gradient, it is broadened to a substantial fraction of the total size. In that situation the entropy per site approaches kB ln(n+1), where\nn is the local number of indistinguishable bosons per site\n(in our samples, n varies across the trap between 1 and 3).\nThe maximum entropy of the spin system is thus larger\nthan the entropy of the kinetic degrees of freedom. Thus,\nsubstantial cooling of the system can be achieved with a\nsingle gradient demagnetization ramp. We have made a\nmore quantitative analysis of spin gradient demagnetization by calculating entropy-versus-temperature curves\nof our system in various field gradients [25]. The results\nconfirm the qualitative argument above and show that\nspin gradient demagnetization cooling is capable of cooling well below the expected Curie temperature.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the results of spin gradient demagnetization cooling experiments. As the gradient is reduced, the width of the domain wall increases (see Fig. 3),\nindicating transfer of entropy from the kinetic degrees\nof freedom to the spins. The width increases much less\nsteeply than would be expected for an isothermal sample,\nimplying cooling. The observed domain wall width can\nbe converted to a temperature using spin gradient thermometry. The measured temperature falls rapidly as the\ngradient is lowered (see Fig. 4). The lowest measured\ntemperature is 350\u00b150 picokelvin, making this the coldest implementation of the atomic Mott insulator. An important goal for future experiments will be to develop an\nadditional method of thermometry to measure the temperature of the kinetic degrees of freedom at this very\nlow temperature scale (for progress towards this goal, see\nRefs [26\u201328]). This temperature is colder than the low-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Entropy transfer from other degrees of freedom to the\nspin system. Circles represent measured width of the mixed\nregion vs. final magnetic field gradient, for the \"equilibrated\nspins\" protocol (see Fig. 1). Error bars are statistical. The\ndashed line represents the expected behaviour assuming no\ncooling. The dash-dotted line shows the minimum resolvable\nwidth. The solid curve is the theoretical prediction, assuming\nan initial temperature of 6.3 nanokelvin and including the\neffects of optical resolution (see Ref. [25] for details). Insets\nshow spin images at the indicated points, the corresponding\nvertically integrated spin profiles (squares), and the fit to the\nexpected form of a tanh function times the overall density\ndistribution (solid line; see Ref. [20] for details). Axis units\nand grayscales in the two insets are abitrary but identical.\n\nest temperature ever measured in an equilibrated kinetic\nsystem [29], and it is within a factor of 2 of the expected\nmagnetic ordering temperature [5].\nTheoretical curves in Figs. 3 and 4 (see also reference [25]) show reasonable agreement with the data.\nThese curves were fitted to the measured temperatures\nusing only one free parameter: the initial temperature\nat the maximum gradient. The initial temperature inferred from this fit is 6.3 nanokelvin. In our earlier work\non thermometry [20], where the lowest measured temperature was 1 nanokelvin, some adiabatic demagnetization cooling may have occurred during the preparation of\nthe system. The flattening-out observed in the measured\ndata at low gradients could be a signal that all accessible\nentropy has been pumped into the spin system.\nThere are both practical and theoretical limits on the\ntemperatures which can be attained with spin gradient\ndemagnetization cooling. In traditional magnetic refrigeration experiments, the minimum temperature is often\nset by the minimum achievable magnetic field or the presence of internal fields in the refrigerant [30]. Analogues\nof both these limits are relevant here. Practically, the ratio between the highest and lowest attainable magnetic\nfield gradients is an upper bound on the ratio between\nthe initial and final temperatures. In our experiment, the\nmaximum value of \u2207|Bi |/\u2207|Bf | is about 1000 (limited\nmainly by the accuracy of determining the zero crossing\nof the gradient), which would give a minimum temperature below 10 picokelvin. Another limit stems from the\n\nFIG. 4: Spin gradient demagnetization cooling. Circles represent measured temperature vs. final magnetic field gradient,\nfor the \"equilibrated spins\" protocol (see Fig. 1). Error bars\nare statistical. These measurements are the same as those\nshown in Fig. 3. The dashed line follows the isothermal trajectory and the dash-dotted line shows the resolution limit.\nThe solid line is the theoretical prediction, assuming an initial\ntemperature of 6.3 nanokelvin and including the effects of optical resolution. The dotted line is the theoretical prediction\nwithout the effects of optical resolution.\n\nsmall difference between the inter-spin interaction energy\nU\u2191\u2193 and the mean of the intra-spin interaction energies\n(U\u2191\u2191 + U\u2193\u2193 )/2. For 87 Rb, this limit is not expected to\npreclude cooling below the expected magnetic ordering\ntemperature [25]. The fundamental limit is set by the\ntotal entropy of the system. A single Mott insulator has\nan entropy per particle much less than kB ln 2. At high\ngradient, the spin entropy is negligible. Lowering the gradient provides a controlled way of creating a completely\nmixed two component system at the same entropy which\nis low enough for spin ordering to occur. This technique\nthus provides a specific and realistic method of realizing\nmagnetic phase transitions in optical lattices.\nOur scheme differs from single-shot adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (including that demonstrated in\na gas of chromium atoms [31]) in that the magnetic field\nis replaced by a magnetic field gradient, and spin flip collisions by spin transport. The chromium scheme cannot\nbe applied to alkali atoms due to the much slower spin-flip\nrates, and extending it from microkelvins to picokelvins\nwould require sub-microgauss magnetic field control. In\nprevious work [20], we suggested that adiabatic reduction of the gradient could be used for cooling, and some\naspects of this proposal have recently been theoretically\naddressed and verified [32].\nThe concept behind spin gradient demagnetization\ncooling is compelling; if adiabaticity can be maintained,\nthen strong cooling in a lattice will occur. Our experimental implementation was designed to allow the system\nto equilibrate as much as possible at low lattice depths.\nWe have tested reversibility by replacing the single gradient ramp by a sequence of ramp down, ramp up, ramp\n\n\f4\ndown. This led to no detectable difference in the final\nmeasured temperature. This indicates that the gradient\nramps are adiabatic. Equilibration in the Mott insulator is more difficult to demonstrate, although the previously demonstrated agreement between spin gradient\nthermometry and cloud size thermometry at high temperatures [20] indicates that the kinetic and spin degrees\nof freedom are equilibrated in that regime. The fact that\nthe spin distribution fits well to the form expected of an\nequilibrated spin system is also evidence for equilibration,\nas is the one-parameter fit to our theoretical predictions\n(which assume adiabaticity). However, if the lattice is\ndeepened, then lowered to zero, then raised again, heating is generally observed. Thus, we cannot rule out the\nexistence of long-lived metastable excitations in the Mott\ninsulating state which do not couple to the spin degrees\nof freedom and thus do not influence our temperature\nmeasurement. Other experiments have seen evidence of\nlong equilibration times in the Mott insulator [24, 33].\nFor quicker equilibration, spin gradient demagnetization\ncooling could be implemented with lighter atomic species\n(e.g. 7 Li or 4 He\u2217 ) and/or shorter period optical lattices.\nThe cooling technique using isolated spins presented\nhere has achieved spin temperatures and entropies well\nbelow the critical values for magnetic ordering, and spin\ngradient demagnetization cooling of equilibrated spins\nhas cooled to a point within reach of the critical values.\nThis work thus opens a realistic path towards observation of superexchange-driven phase transitions in optical lattices, and extends the potential of ultracold atoms\ntrapped in optical lattices to be used as flexible quantum\nsimulators of strongly interacting many-body systems.\nWe acknowledge discussions with Eugene Demler,\nTakuya Kitagawa, David Pekker, and Aditi Mitra.\nWe thank Aviv Keshet for a critical reading of the\nmanuscript.
