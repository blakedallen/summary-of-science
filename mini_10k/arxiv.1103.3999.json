Graphene\nnanoribbons, in particular, are of interest because they exhibit a conduction bandgap that arises due\nto size confinement and edge effects [3]-[11]. From the electronic applications point of view, graphenebased materials with gap are very desirable. This lead to substantial theoretical and experimental\nefforts to generate and control the energy gap in graphene based devices. One approach is based on\nquantum confinement as in quantum dots and nanoribbons, where it was shown that the energy gap\nvalue increases with decreasing nanoribbon width [12].\nTheoretical studies have suggested that graphene nanoribbons could have interesting magnetoelectronic properties, with predicted very large magnetoresistance [4, 13]. Experimental observation\nof a significant enhancement in the conductance of a graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistor by a\nperpendicular magnetic field has been reported recently [14]. They have observed an extraordinarily\nlarge tunable magnetoresistance in graphene nanoribbon\u2013FET devices and an increase in conductance\nby a factor of over 10,000 was demonstrated at 1.6K. This magnetoresistance can be readily tuned\nby the gate voltage and source-drain bias, with enhancement reaching maxima near the edges of the\nconduction bandgap. These experimental findings clearly demonstrate that the graphene nanoribbons\nexhibit interesting magneto-transport properties, with the possibility of opening up exciting opportunities in magnetic sensing and a new generation of magneto-electronic devices.\nOn the other hand, more efforts have been made to understand the scattering behavior of fermions\nin graphene. In particular we cite [15] where the transmission through magnetic barriers in graphenebased nanostructures were studied. Several particular cases were considered: a magnetic step, single\nand double barriers, and \u03b4-function barriers. A separate class of magnetic-barrier structures are those\nwith inhomogeneous magnetic-field profiles, such that the average magnetic field vanishes, which can be\nrealized by nanostructured ferromagnetic stripes placed on top of the graphene layer. Quantum bound\nstates that are localized near or in the barrier are predicted for a magnetic step and some structures\nwith finite-width barriers but none for \u03b4-function barriers. When a bound state is localized close to\nthe barrier edge, it has a nonzero velocity parallel to this edge. The transmission depends strongly\non the direction of the incident electron or hole wave vector and gives the possibility to construct\na direction dependent wave vector filter. In general, the resonant structure of the transmission is\nsignificantly more pronounced for (Dirac) electrons with linear spectrum than for the usual electrons\nwith a parabolic spectrum.\nMotivated by different results on the scattering behavior, we study fermions in graphene nanoribbon subject to a sharply localized magnetic field. We show that the solution space of the present\nsystem is the union of two solution subspaces governed by two different kinetic balance equations.\nThese two solution subspaces are not identical and their union constitutes the whole space of solution\nof the problem. To know which energy domain is selected by each kinetic balance relation, we perform\na unitary transformation on the fundamental Dirac equation. Such a transformation does not affect\nthe energy spectrum or the physics of the problem. After matching the eigenspinors at the boundary\nconditions, we evaluate the reflection and transmission amplitudes in terms of the energy and magnetic\n1\n\n\ffield. A detailed study of their coefficients is presented as well.\nSubsequently, we consider a magnetic field of a bell shape normal to the graphene strip, which\n~\nis stretched along the x-axis, i.e. B(x)\n= \u1e91B0 sech2 (\u03bcx) where B0 is the strength of the field and\n\u03bc\u22121 represents its range. We show that the solution space of the corresponding Hamiltonian splits\ninto three regions depending on the sign of kB0 and the energy range, with k being the wave vector\nalong the y-axis. Using the corresponding current density, we evaluate the reflection and transmission\ncoefficients, which reduce to those obtained in section 3 for very large \u03bc. Finally, we treat the case of\na double step pseudoscalar potential and also double Gaussian type magnetic field.\nThe manuscript is organized as follows. We present our theoretical model by setting up the general\nform of potential in section 2. As a first illustration, we consider \u03b4-type magnetic field in section 3.\nAfter obtaining the solutions of the energy spectrum, we study the scattering problem by evaluating\nexplicitly the reflection and transmission coefficients and investigate their physical properties. Because\nthe \u03b4-type magnetic field is a limiting case of a sharply peaked field, we study Dirac fermions in a\nGaussian magnetic field, in section 4. These results motivated us to deal with an integrating case of a\ndouble \u03b4-type magnetic field in section 5 and the corresponding double Gaussian type magnetic field\nis considered in the appendix. We conclude our work in the final section.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical model\n\nIn graphene, the low energy linear electronic band dispersion near the Dirac points gave rise to charge\ncarriers (electrons or holes) that propagate as if they were massless fermions with speeds of the order\nof 106 m/s rather than the speed of light 3 \u00d7 108 m/s. Hence, charge carriers in this system should be\ndescribed by the massless Dirac equation rather than the usual Schrodinger equation. However, we\nshould stress that such a continuum approximation remains valid up to wave vectors of the order of\nthe inverse lattice spacing. Under this approximation we can describe our charge carriers by a gauge\ninvariant Dirac Hamiltonian in 2 + 1 space-time dimensions with minimal coupling to the three-vector\n~ = (V, Ax , Ay ) as follows\npotential A\u03bc = (A0 , A)\n~ + A)\n~\nH = m\u03b30 + V + \u03b30~\u03b3 * (i\u2207\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b30 = \u03c33 , ~\u03b3 = (\u03b3x , \u03b3y ) = i(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) and {\u03c3i }3i=1 are the 2\u00d72 Pauli matrices. Adopting the\nconventional relativistic units ~ = c = e = 1, we obtain [16]\n!\n\u2202\n\u2202\nm+V\n\u2212 \u2202x\n+ i \u2202y\n+ iAx + Ay\nH=\n.\n(2)\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212m + V\n\u2202x + i \u2202y \u2212 iAx + Ay\nAs we claimed before, for a system made of graphene the charge carriers are massless m = 0 and\nmoving with the Fermi velocity vF (about 106 m/s). Moreover, we specialize to a physical configuration\n~ = \u0177W (x). Thus,\ncorresponding to a single graphene sheet in a magnetic field with vector potential A\nthe associated stationary Dirac equation becomes\n!\uf8eb + \uf8f6\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c8\n\u2212\u03b5\n\u2212 \u2202x\n+ i \u2202y\n+W\n\uf8ed \u2212 \uf8f8 = 0.\n(3)\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c8\n+i +W\n\u2212\u03b5\n\u2202x\n\n\u2202y\n\n2\n\n\fWe can separate variables and write\n\u03c8 \u00b1 (x, y) = \u03c6\u00b1 (x)\u03c7(y)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c7(y) = e\u2212i ky and k is a real parameter that stands for the wave number of the excitations along\nthe y-axis. The resulting reduced equation is given by\n!\n!\nd\n\u03c6+\n+W +k\n\u2212\u03b5\n\u2212 dx\n= 0.\n(5)\nd\n\u03c6\u2212\n\u2212\u03b5\ndx + W + k\nIn the present representation W plays the role of a pseudoscalar potential coupling.

The two potential partners in SSQM are V 2 \u00b1 V \u2032 , where V is the\nsuperpotential and in our case we have V = W + k. The relativistic extension of SSQM exhibited\nin some models that are governed by the Dirac theory is due to the fact that the associated Dirac\nHamiltonian is an element of the 4-dimensional superalgebra U (1/1), which is a Z2 graded extension\nof SO(2, 1) Lie algebra [18]. It is interesting to note that the corresponding massive (1+1) Dirac\nequation\n!\n!\nd\n+W\n\u03c6+\nm \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 dx\n=0\n(8)\nd\n\u2212m \u2212 \u03b5\n\u03c6\u2212\ndx + W\nresults in the following Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation\n\u0015\n\u0014\ndW\nd2\n2\n2\n2\n+ m \u2212 \u03b5 \u03c6\u00b1 = 0\n\u2212 2 +W \u2213\ndx\ndx\n\n(9)\n\nwhich has the same structure associated with SSQM as in (7) with the mapping W \u2192 W +k. Therefore,\nthe solution of the two problems are similar with k playing the role of the mass m. We have encountered\nthis phenomenon before, where space reduction (due to compactification or symmetry) transforms the\n2D massless problem into an effective 1D massive problem [19]. Note that the complete solution space\nof the Dirac equation (5) is the union of the two solution subspaces of equations (6) and (7) with\nthe top and bottom signs, respectively. Below, we identify the energy regions associated with each\nsubspace.\n\n3\n\nDirac Fermions in a \u03b4-type magnetic field\n\nHere we consider the zero range and infinite strength limit where the magnetic field takes the form\n~\nB(x)\n= \u1e91B0 \u03b4(x/a), with a is a length scale parameter. The main advantage of this configuration is\nthat it is amenable to analytical treatment and interesting results. Thus, the single-step pseudoscalar\npotential is given by\nW (x) = aB0 \u0398(x/a)\n(10)\n3\n\n\fwhere \u0398(x) being the Heaviside step function, such as\n(\n1,\n\u0398(x) =\n0,\n\nx>0\nx<0\n\n(11)\n\nFigure 1 shows the schematics of a laboratory set-up where a coil of a rectangular cross section with\nvery narrow width will result in the necessary current sheet that should produce a magnetic field\napproximating that of our problem. The graphene ribbon is the strip that penetrates the coil along\nthe x -axis in the figure:\n\nFig. 1: Schematic of a set-up where a coil of a rectangular cross section with very narrow width produces\na magnetic field approximating that of our problem.\nTo study the scattering behavior in the present problem, we first determine the plane wave solutions\nassociated with both regions, \u00b1x > 0.

Thus the quantity |\u03c9\u00b1 | plays the role of an\neffective mass with different asymptotic values at \u00b1x > 0. That is, our massless problem is equivalent\nto a space dependent massive problem whose effective mass depends on the strength of the localized\nmagnetic field and the value of component of the wave number along the y-direction.\nWe need to reassert that the total solution space of the problem is the union of the two solution\nsubspaces (6) and (7). These two solution subspaces are, in general, not identical and their union\nconstitutes the whole space of solution of our problem. To resolve the issue of which energy domain\nis selected by which kinetic balance relation (12) or (16), we perform a unitary transformation on the\nfundamental Dirac equation (5). Such a transformation does not affect the physics of the problem.\n\u03c0\nWe choose a rotation by \u03c0/4 about the y-axis, U = ei 4 \u03c32 . Thus, the transformed Hamiltonian and\nwavefunction read\nH\u0303 = U HU \u2020 = \u2212i\u03c32\n\nd\n+ (W + k)\u03c33\ndx\n\n(19)\n\n\u03c6\u0303 = U \u03c6\nthen (5) becomes\n\u0010\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0011\nd\nH\u0303 \u2212 \u03b5I \u03c6\u0303 = \u2212i\u03c32\n+ (W + k)\u03c33 \u2212 \u03b5I \u03c6\u0303\ndx\n\n(20)\n\nleading to the following new kinetic balance relation\n\nd \u00b1\n\u22131\n\u03c6\u0303\n\u03b5 \u00b1 (W + k) dx\n\n(21)\n\n\u03b5 = \u2213 (aB0 + k) = \u2213\u03c9+ .\n\n(22)\n\n\u03c6\u0303\u2213 =\nwhich is not valid for\n\nThus, for k > \u2212aB0 , this relation with the top/bottom sign corresponds to the positive/negative energy subspace2 . Now, since equation (20) results from a unitary transformations of (12) and (16), then\nthe same applies to those equations as well. That is, equations (12) and (16) are valid for positive and\nnegative energy, respectively. Figure 2 shows the potential configuration of the problem. Dark/light\ngrey areas correspond to negative/positive energy continuum where the solution is oscillatory of the\nform e\u00b1i\u03bax . The white areas correspond to bound states where the solutions are exponentials, e\u00b1\u03bax .\nIn the subsequent developments, we will only be considering scattering solutions with a normalized\nincident beam from left. Thus, the relativistic energy must be \u03b5 > |k| and the solution space is built\nonly from the positive energy solutions (14).\n2\n\nHowever, if k < \u2212aB0 then the top/bottom sign corresponds to negative/positive energy subspace.\n\n5\n\n\fe\u00b1ikx\n\n+ \u03a9+\n\n1\u00de\nR\u00de\n\naB0\nT\n\n\u00de\n\n+k\ne\u00b1kx\n \u0301\n\n0\n\nx\n\n-k\n\n- \u03a9+\n\ne\u00b1ikx\n\nFig. 2: The potential configuration of the problem. Dark/light grey areas correspond to negative/positive\nenergy continuum. The white areas correspond to bound states where the solutions are exponentials.\nThe total solution space splits into two regions depending on the energy range as follows. For\n|k| < \u03b5 < |\u03c9+ |, scattering with total reflection will take place. It should be noted that there is no\nKlein tunneling in this problem due to the absence of vector interaction. With a normalized incident\nflux from left, the solution of equation (5) is obtained from (14) as\n\u03c6(x) =\n\n(\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\nwhere we have set\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2212i\u03bax ,\n1\n\u03b1\u2217 e\ne\u2212\u03ba+ x ,\n\nei\u03bax\u0010 + \u0011\nR\nA\n\n\u03ba = |\u03ba\u2212 | =\n\n1\n\u03b2+\n\np\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b52 \u2212 k2 ,\n\nx<0\nx>0\n\n\u03b1 = (k \u2212 i\u03ba)/\u03b5.\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nContinuity of the wavefunction at x = 0 gives the reflection amplitude\nR=\u2212\n\naB0 + \u03ba+ + i\u03ba\n\u03b2+ \u2212 \u03b1\n=\u2212\n\u03b2+ \u2212 \u03b1\u2217\naB0 + \u03ba+ \u2212 i\u03ba\n\n(25)\n\nand the normalization parameter A = 1 + R. It is clear that we have complete reflection in this case\nsince |R| = 1. It is also worth mentioning that the probability density in the positive x-direction is\ngiven by\n\u03c1(x) = |A|2 e\u22122|\u03ba+ |x (1 + |\u03b2+ |2 )\n(26)\nwhich shows that the penetration depth, \u03bb, of the Fermion into the barrier region defined by\n\u03bb=\n\n1\n1\n= p\n2\n2|\u03ba+ |\n2 (aB0 + k)2 \u2212 \u01eb2\n\n(27)\n\ndecreases very rapidly with increase in the magnetic field strength. This result indicates the possibility\nto confine the fermions in any region between two \u03b4-like magnetic fields generated by a symmetric\ndouble step pseudoscalar potential, this situation will be treated in section 5.\n\n6\n\n\fNow, let us move on to analyze the scattering situation when \u03b5 > |\u03c9+ | so that partial reflection\nwill take place.

If we take the limit a \u2192 0 in the above equations we get, by replacing \u03c9+ and\n\u03c9\u2212 by \u03c9+ = B2 \u2212 k and \u03c9\u2212 = B1 \u2212 k, respectively, and B0 by B1 \u2212 B2 , the transmission and reflection\namplitude for the Dirac particle scattered by a double-step pseudoscalar potential W (x) (51). For\nthe special case B2 = \u2212B1 = 0.002 the transmission and reflection coefficients coincide with those\nobtained in the case of scattering of Dirac fermions by a single step pseudoscalar potential plotted in\nfigure 6 (b).\nGiven the wavefunctions associated with the incident, reflected and transmitted beams, one may\ncalculate the corresponding current densities according to [23]. Figure 8 illustrate the configuration\nof the solution space of our problem.

After matching the wavefunction at the point x = 0, the\nreflection and transmission amplitudes were derived in standard way. A study of the transmission\ncoefficient as a function of the strength of field B0 was done, the transmission is unity for B0 = 0 and\nreduces sharply for strong field.\n~\nThe general case of a bell shape magnetic field normal to the graphene sheet, namely B(x)\n=\n2\n\u22121\n\u1e91B0 sech (\u03bcx) was studied, B0 being the strength of the field and \u03bc stands for its range. It was\nshown that the solution space of the corresponding Hamiltonian splits into three regions depending on\nthe sign of kB0 and the energy range, k is the wave vector along the y-axis. To obtain the reflection\nand transmission coefficients we used the current density, our results reduce to those obtained for\n\u03b4-type magnetic field for large values of \u03bc, here we took \u03bc = 1000. Moreover, the phase shift that\ncharacterizes the transmission amplitude is given in terms of the energy and magnetic field.\nSubsequently, we considered the case of an asymmetric double step pseudoscalar potential of the\nform W (x) = B1 [1 \u2212 \u0398(x + a)] + B2 \u0398(x \u2212 a). After obtaining the general solution of the Dirac\nequation, we matched the wavefunction at the points \u00b1a to obtain the reflection and transmissions\namplitudes for the negative and positive energy solutions. Different field configuration were considered\nbut the interesting situation obtains when B2 = \u2212B1 = 0.002 which enables us to recover the reflection\nand transmission coefficients for scattering of Dirac fermions by a double step pseudoscalar potential.\nMoreover, for the present potential we studied the corresponding bound states using graphical solution\nof the transcendental equations. We reached the conclusion that there are at most two bound states\nfor even parity and two for old parity solutions.\nFinally a double Gaussian type magnetic field was considered in appendix A where a second\norder differential equation for spinor components was solved analytically. The corresponding general\nsolution was given in terms of the HeunG functions. The asymptotic behavior as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e of these\nwavefunctions were obtained and enabled us to extract the corresponding reflection and transmission\ncoefficients.\n\n15\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe generous support provided by the Saudi Center for Theoretical Physics (SCTP) is highly appreciated by all Authors.
