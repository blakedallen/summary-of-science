Accretion, accretion disks \u2013 Instabilities \u2013 Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) \u2013 Plasmas\n\n1. Introduction\nAccretion disks are very common objects in astrophysics. These objects can be found in stellar systems as well as in\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). In the first case, the disk accretes matter onto a protostar (young stellar object (YSO)),\nwhite dwarf, neutron star, or a black hole. The typical size of these disks is a few hundred astronomical units (AU). A\nmassive black hole is the central object in the case of an accretion disk in AGN. Here, the typical size of the disk is a\nhundred parsecs (pc).\nMuch research on accretion disk dynamics focuses on occuring accretion processes in an MHD framework. This is\ndone linearly as well as non\u2013linearly. The linear studies aim to understand the drivers of the accretion mechanism. This\ncan be done by looking at waves and instabilities about a disk equilibrium in the cylindrical limit (see e.g. Keppens et\nal. 2002, Blokland et al. 2005, van der Swaluw et al. 2005, and references therein). In this limit the disk equilibrium is\nessentially one\u2013dimensional and one can use a self\u2013similar model like the one of Spruit et al. (1987). When instabilities\nare found, one must compute the resulting evolution non\u2013linearly to see if these instabilities give rise to turbulence.\nThis turbulence may be the source of an enhanced effective viscosity mechanism which causes an increased transport\nof angular momentum outwards, as needed for accretion (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). Balbus & Hawley (1991) discussed\nthat the MHD turbulence resulting from the magneto\u2013rotational instability (Velikhov 1959 and Chandrasekhar 1960)\ncould provide this angular momentum transport.\nIn the last years, global two or even three\u2013dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of accretion\ndisks have been performed (see for example Matsumoto & Shibata 1997 and Armitage 1998). In these simulations, the\nnon\u2013linear dynamics is usually interpreted as a direct consequence of the magneto\u2013rotational instability (see for example Hawley et al. 2001) leading to angular momentum transport outwards. Another possibility for the initial and\nSend offprint requests to: J.W.S. Blokland e-mail: J-W.S.Blokland@Rijnhuizen.nl\n\n\f2\n\nJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\nevolving dynamics is that both the convective and the magneto\u2013rotational instability play an important role in the\nangular momentum transport (see for example Igumenshchev et al. 2003). In the latter case, these disks are known as\nconvection\u2013dominated accretion flows (CDAF). However,especially those global simulations starting from initial axisymmetric accretion tori (see for example Hawley 2000) are at best loosely connected to the linear stability studies. A detailed\ncatalogue of the MHD spectrum of such two\u2013dimensional disks is completely lacking. Moreover, the usual identification\nof the cause of the turbulent dynamics with the linear magneto\u2013rotational or convective instability is mostly based on\nthe extrapolation of the linear stability analysis from a one\u2013dimensional to a two or three\u2013dimensional accretion disk.\nSuch extrapolating ignores the fact that if one performs a detailed MHD stability study of a two\u2013dimensional accretion\ndisk, one may find many new types of instability that all could lead to effective angular momentum transport. A recent\nexample of such new, poloidal flow\u2013driven type of instability is presented by Goedbloed et al. (2004a), where the Trans\u2013\nslow Alfv\u00e9n Continuum (TSAC) mode is shown to occur inside a disk with toroidal and super\u2013slow poloidal flow in the\npresence of a strong gravitational potential.\nThis paper has two aims. The first one is to present the equations and the numerical solutions of two\u2013dimensional MHD\ndisk equilibria with toroidal flows, but without poloidal flows. This case is fundamentally different from the previously\ndiscussed one of combined poloidal and toroidal flows (Goedbloed et al. 2004a) because the equilibria are described by\nquite different flux functions. By considering an axisymmetric equilibrium, we are able to model a thick accretion disk\nwithout any further approximations. All the equilibria presented below are computed using the code FINESSE (Beli\u00ebn\net al. 2002). The second aim is to present a detailed stability analysis of these two\u2013dimensional equilibria. The analysis\nis done theoretically as well as numerically. For the stability computations we have used the recently published spectral\ncode PHOENIX (Blokland et al. 2006). To our knowlegde, this kind of analysis for MHD disk equilibria with purely\ntoroidal flow has never been presented in the astrophysical literature until now.\nWe will present a sample of disk equilibria where the disk plasma typically varies from strongly magnetized up to close\nto equipartition. Also, the rotational speed of the plasma varies from sub\u2013Keplerian up to Keplerian. The theoretical\npart of the spectral analysis of these equilibria shows that the convective continuum instabilities may appear inside the\ndisk. These instabilities are part of the continuous branches that exist in the MHD spectrum of the linear eigenmodes of\nthe disk tori and are localised on magnetic flux surfaces. We derive a stability criterion for this instability. This criterion\nlooks similar to the Schwarzschild criterion. However, our criterion governs convective instabilities along the poloidal\nmagnetic field lines while the Schwarzschild criterion applies in the direction perpendicular to the poloidal magnetic field\nlines. This theoretical analysis has been verified by our numerical stability calculations.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the equations which govern a two\u2013dimensional accretion disk\nequilibrium. In Sect. 3, we recall the essential elements from spectral theory of MHD waves and instabilities, such as\nthe Frieman and Rotenberg formalism (Frieman & Rotenberg 1960), straight field line coordinates and representation.\nIn Sect. 4, these are used to derive the equations for the continuous MHD spectrum and the stability criterion for the\nconvective instability. The numerical codes FINESSE and PHOENIX are discussed in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6, we present our\nnumerical results on the disk equilibria and their stability analysis. Finally, in Sect. 7, we summarise and present our\nconclusions.\n\n2. Accretion disk equilibrium\nWe consider an axisymmetric accretion disk. Because of this symmetry, cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, \u03c6) are used and\nthe equilibrium quantities only depend on the poloidal coordinates R and Z. The disk equilibrium is modeled by the\nideal MHD equations,\n\u2202v\n\u03c1\n= \u2212\u03c1v * \u2207v \u2212 \u2207p + j \u00d7 B \u2212 \u03c1\u2207\u03a6,\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u2202p\n= \u2212v * \u2207p \u2212 \u03b3p\u2207 * v,\n(2)\n\u2202t\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B) ,\n(3)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1v) ,\n(4)\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03c1, p, v, B, \u03a6 and \u03b3 are the density, pressure, velocity, magnetic field, gravitational potential, and the ratio of the\nspecific heats, respectively. The current density j = \u2207 \u00d7 B and the equation \u2207 * B = 0 has to be satisfied. Furthermore,\nthe disk equilibrium is assumed to be time-independent. The relation between the density and the thermal pressure is\nexpressed by the ideal gas law: p = \u03c1T . From the equations \u2207 * B = 0 and \u2207 * j = 0 it follows that the magnetic field and\nthe current density can be written as\n1\nB = e\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2207\u03c8 + B\u03c6 e\u03c6 ,\n(5)\nR\n1\nj = \u2212 e\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2207I + j\u03c6 e\u03c6 ,\n(6)\nR\nrespectively. Here, 2\u03c0\u03c8 is the poloidal flux and the poloidal stream function I = RB\u03c6 . We restrict ourselves to disk\nequilibria with purely toroidal flow,\nv = v\u03c6 e\u03c6 = R\u03a9e\u03c6 .\n(7)\n\n\fJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n3\n\nIn this case, equations (2) and (4) are trivially satisfied. The angular velocity \u03a9 is related to the electric field,\nE = \u2212v \u00d7 B = \u03a9\u2207\u03c8,\n\n(8)\n\nand making use of the induction equation (3) it can be easily shown that \u03a9 = \u03a9(\u03c8).\nThree different projections can be applied on the momentum equation (1). The projections are in the toroidal direction\nand in the poloidal plane parallel and perpendicular to the poloidal magnetic field lines. From the toroidal projection\none can show that the poloidal stream function is a flux function, i.e. I = I(\u03c8). The projection parallel to the poloidal\nmagnetic field results in two equations,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03a6\n,\n= \u03c1 R\u03a92 \u2212\n\u2202R \u03c8=const\n\u2202R\n(9)\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03a6\n,\n= \u2212\u03c1\n\u2202Z \u03c8=const\n\u2202Z\nwhich have to be satisfied simultaneously. From these two equations we conclude that the pressure p = p(\u03c8; R, Z).

The assumption that the\ntemperature is a flux function can be justified due to the high thermal conductivity along the magnetic field lines. This\nis true at least up to the transport time scale, which is long compared to the Alfv\u00e9n time. The resulting pressure can\nthen be written as\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03a6(R, Z)\n,\n(11)\np(\u03c8; R, Z) = p0 (\u03c8) exp (R2 \u2212 R02 )\u039bT (\u03c8) \u2212\nT (\u03c8)\nwhere \u039bT \u2261 \u03a92 /(2T ) is a flux function, p0 is the pressure for a static pure Grad\u2013Shafranov equilibrium without gravity,\nand R0 is the geometric axis of the accretion disk.

Frieman\u2013Rotenberg formalism\nFor the investigation of stability properties of stationary MHD equilibria, the formalism by Frieman and Rotenberg (1960)\nhas been used. They derived from the linearised MHD equations, one second order differential equation for the Lagrangian\ndisplacement vector field \u03be,\n\u22022\u03be\n\u2202\u03be\n(18)\n\u2212 \u03c1 2 = 0,\nF(\u03be) \u2212 2\u03c1v * \u2207\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nwhere the force operator F(\u03be) is\nF(\u03be) = Fstatic (\u03be) + \u2207\u03a6\u2207 * (\u03c1\u03be) + \u2207 * [\u03c1\u03bev * \u2207v \u2212 \u03c1vv * \u2207\u03be] .\n\n(19)\n\nHere,\nFstatic (\u03be) = \u2212\u2207\u03a0 + B * \u2207Q + Q * \u2207B\n\n(20)\n\nis the force operator for static equilibria without gravity, which has been derived by Bernstein et al. (1958). Here, the\nEulerian perturbation of the total pressure,\n\u03a0 = \u2212\u03b3p\u2207 * \u03be \u2212 \u03be * \u2207p + B * Q,\n\n(21)\n\nand the Eulerian perturbation of the magnetic field,\nQ = \u2207 \u00d7 (\u03be \u00d7 B) .\n\n(22)\n\nThe time\u2013dependence for the displacement field is assumed to be an exponential one with normal mode frequencies \u03c9,\n\u03be = \u03be\u0302 exp(\u2212i\u03c9t). Using this assumption, the Frieman\u2013Rotenberg equation can be written as\nF(\u03be) + 2i\u03c1\u03c9v * \u2207\u03be + \u03c1\u03c9 2 \u03be = 0.\n\n(23)\n\nIn the derivations below, the toroidal symmetry of the accretion disk equilibrium is exploited. This is done by writing\nthe toroidal dependence of the displacement field as \u03be \u223c exp(in\u03c6), where n is the toroidal mode number.\n3.2. Straight field line coordinates\nThe analytical and numerical analysis of MHD waves and instabilities are done in 'straight field line' coordinates. To\nconvert from cylindrical (R, Z, \u03c6) to straight field line coordinates (x1 \u2261 \u03c8, x2 \u2261 \u03b8, x3 \u2261 \u03c6) one needs the metric tensor\nand the Jacobian associated with the non\u2013orthogonal coordinates in which the equilibrium field lines appear straight.\nThis is standard practice in MHD spectral studies for laboratory tokamak plasmas. The metric elements gij and the\nJacobian J are\n\u2202r \u2202r\n\u22121\n(24)\ng ij = \u2207xi * \u2207xj ,\ngij =\n*\n,\nJ = (\u2207\u03c8 \u00d7 \u2207\u03b8 * \u2207\u03c6) ,\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\nrespectively. Here, the poloidal angle \u03b8 is constructed such that the magnetic field lines are straight in the (\u03b8, \u03c6)\u2013plane.\nThe slope of these lines is a flux function:\nd\u03c6\nd\u03b8\n\n=\nfieldline\n\nB * \u2207\u03c6\nIJ\n= 2 = q(\u03c8),\nB * \u2207\u03b8\nR\n\n(25)\n\n\fJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n5\n\nwhere q is the safety factor. Furthermore, in straight field coordinates the poloidal and toroidal curvature of the magnetic\nsurfaces are\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng12\nR\n\u03bap = \u2212n * (t * \u2207t)\n=\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202\u03b8\nJB\u03b8 ,\n(26)\nJ\ng22\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng12\n\u03bat = \u2212n * (e\u03c6 * \u2207e\u03c6 ) = B\u03b8 \u2202\u03c8 \u2212\n(27)\n\u2202\u03b8 R,\ng22\nrespectively. Here, n = \u2207\u03c8/|\u2207\u03c8| and t = B\u03b8 /B\u03b8 , where B\u03b8 is the poloidal magnetic field. It is important to realise that\nthe straight field coordinates can only be constructed when the solution \u03c8(R, Z) has been computed from the extended\nGrad-Shafranov equation (10).\n3.3. Field line projection and representation\nOn each flux surface the distinction between two wave directions can be made: one parallel and the other one perpendicular\nto the magnetic field. These directions correspond to the short wavelength limit of slow and Alfv\u00e9n waves in cylindrical\ngeometry. Hence, it is useful to exploit a projection based on the magnetic surfaces and field lines using the triad of unit\nvectors,\n\u2207\u03c8\nB\nn\u2261\n,\n\u03c0 \u2261 b \u00d7 n,\nb\u2261 .\n(28)\n|\u2207\u03c8|\nB\nUsing these unit vectors, the components of the displacement field \u03be can be written as\nX \u2261 RB\u03b8 \u03be * n,\n\nY \u2261i\n\nB\n\u03be * \u03c0,\nRB\u03b8\n\nZ\u2261i\n\n1\n\u03be * b,\nB\n\n(29)\n\nand the projected gradient operators become\nD\u2261\n\n1\nn*\u2207\nRB\u03b8\n\n= \u2202\u03c8 \u2212\n\ng12\n\u2202\u03b8 ,\ng22\n\n\u2212iI\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 nB\u03b82 ,\nJ\n\u2212i\nnq\n=\n\u2202\u03b8 +\n.\nJ\nJ\n\n(30)\n\nG \u2261 \u2212iRB\u03b8 B\u03c0 * \u2207 =\n\n(31)\n\nF \u2261 \u2212iB * \u2207\n\n(32)\n\nThe second equality in the expressions for F and G only holds when these operators act on a component of the displacement field \u03be.\nUsing the straight field line coordinates and the projections (29) the Frieman-Rotenberg equation (18) can be written\nas\n!\nX\n2\n(33)\n(A + R)x + 2\u03c1e\n\u03c9\u03a9Cx \u2212 \u03c1e\n\u03c9 Bx = 0,\nwith x \u2261 Y ,\nZ\nwhere \u03c9\ne (\u03c8) \u2261 \u03c9 \u2212 n\u03a9(\u03c8) is the Doppler shifted eigenfrequency.

The matrix C represents the Coriolis effect\ndue to the rotation while the matrix R contains rotational as well as gravitational effects. The case without an external\ngravitational potential has been discussed by van der Holst et al. (2000b).\nTwo kinds of cylindrical limits can be obtained from the spectral equation (33). The first one is the infinitely slender\ntorus, meaning that the radial position of accretion disk is taken to be at infinity. In that case the matrices R and\nC disappear. This is due to the fact that all equilibrium quantities will be become independent of the angle \u03b8, the\ngravitational potential at infinity is zero, and the toroidal curvature \u03bat becomes zero. The flow enters only as a Doppler\nshift, \u2212n\u03a9(\u03c8), in the Doppler shifted eigenfrequency \u03c9\ne (\u03c8).\nThe other limit is the cylindrical limit of a thin (|Z|/R \u226a 1) slice of plasma at the equatorial plane of the accretion\ndisk. In this region all equilibrium quantities only depend on the radius R, approximately. The matrices R and C do not\ndisappear as in the previous limit. Also the toroidal curvature \u03bat is non\u2013zero but instead the poloidal curvature \u03bap = 0.\nIn this case the spectral equation (33) reduces to the matrix equation for a one-dimensional accretion disk presented by\nKeppens et al. (2002).\n\n4. Continuous MHD spectrum\nIn the previous section, the spectral equation (33) governing all MHD waves and instabilities in axisymmetric accretion\ndisks has been derived. This equation is the starting point to all following MHD spectral computations. In particular,\nwe can derive the equations for the continuous MHD spectrum by considering modes localised on a particular flux\nsurface \u03c8 = \u03c80 . Van der Holst et al. (2000a) showed that the toroidal flow can drive the continuous spectrum unstable\nor overstable for non\u2013gravitating plasma tori. Here, we show that the combination of toroidal flow and gravity can also\ndrive the MHD continua overstable.\n4.1. General formalism\nTo derive the equations for the continuous spectrum, the normal derivative (\u2202/\u2202\u03c8) of the eigenfunctions is considered\nto be large compared to the eigenfunctions themselves and the Doppler shifted eigenfrequency \u03c9\ne (\u03c8) is assumed finite.

Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n7\n\nNotice, that this solution implies that \u2202X/\u2202\u03c8, Y , and Z are of the same order, but more importantly that X is small\ncompared to Y and Z. This means that the continuum modes are mainly tangential to a particular flux surface.\nInserting the expression (41) into the second and third row of the spectral equation (33) results in an eigenvalue\nproblem which is independent of the normal derivative. Hence, the reduced problem becomes non\u2013singular. Exploiting\nthis property, we can write the projected displacement field components Y and Z as follows:\nY \u2248 \u03b4(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c80 )\u03b7(\u03b8),\nZ \u2248 \u03b4(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c80 )\u03b6(\u03b8),\n\n(42)\n\nwhere \u03b4(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c80 ) is the Dirac delta function. Here, Y and Z have been split in an improper (\u03c8\u2013dependence) and proper\npart (\u03b8\u2013dependence).

(2000b) for\ntokamaks with purely toroidal flow and as the one for static gravitational plasmas published by Poedts et al. (1985) and\nBeli\u00ebn et al. (1997). Furthermore, notice that the poloidal variation of the pressure presented by the matrix r shows up\nin all its matrix elements. This destroys the diagonal dominance of the matrix a, which corresponds to the separation of\nAlfv\u00e9n and slow continuum modes. Similar as the matrix C in spectral equation (33), the matrix c represents the Coriolis\neffect.\nThe non\u2013singular eigenvalue problem (43) is solved for poloidally periodic boundary conditions for the eigenfunctions \u03b7, \u03b6. Solving this problem for a given toroidal mode number n on each flux surface separately results in a set of\ndiscrete eigenvalues. All these discrete sets together map out the continuous spectra. In the MHD formulation with the\nprimitive variables \u03c1, v, p, B, an additional entropy continuum n\u03a9 is found. This Eulerian entropy continuum does not\ncouple to any of the other continua or stable and unstable modes (Goedbloed et al. 2004b).\n\n\f8\n\nJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n4.2. Spectral properties and stability criterion\nIn this subsection a stability criterium for the continua will be derived.

Solutions of this polynomial are \u03c9\ne = (b \u00b1 b2 + ac)/a. This means that if\nb2 + ac \u2265 0, the solutions are waves with real frequencies. But if b2 + ac < 0, the solutions contain\np a damped stable\nwave and an overstable mode. For the complex solution \u03c9\ne one derives its absolute value |e\n\u03c9 | = \u2212c/a by taking the\nlinear combination of the polynomial with its conjugate. Furthermore, Re(\u03c9) = n\u03a9 + b/a. It can easily be shown that\nthe continuum is stable if c \u2265 0. The coefficient c is always equal or greater than zero if\n2\nNBV,pol\n\u22650\n\n(57)\n\nis satisfied everywhere in the plasma. From this stability criterion, we conclude that equilibria with S = S(\u03c8) and equilibria with T = T (\u03c8), \u03b3 \u2265 1 are always stable. Equilibria where the density is a flux function violate this criterion, which\nmay result in the appearance of damped stable and overstable modes. Notice that the stability criterion (57) is analogous to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability. The only important difference is that in the Schwarzschild\ncriterion one deals with normal derivatives while this criterion deals with tangential ones. This has also been noticed by\nHellsten & Spies (1979), Hameiri (1983), and Poedts et al. (1985).\n\n5. Numerical codes\nFor the stability analysis of axisymmetric accretion tori two numerical codes, the equilibrium code FINESSE (Beli\u00ebn\net al. 2002) and the spectral code PHOENIX (Blokland et al. 2006), have been used. In the next two subsections their\nalgorithmic details will be briefly discussed.\n\n\fJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n9\n\nFig. 1. An example of the geometry of an accretion disk with a circular cross-section. Here, R0 and a are the major\nradius of the geometric axis and the radius of the last closed flux surface, respectively\n5.1. The equilibrium code FINESSE\nThe FINESSE code developed by Beli\u00ebn et al. (2002) can compute a stationary axisymmetric, gravitating MHD equilibrium described by the extended Grad\u2013Shafranov equations (12), (14), or (16) for a given poloidal cross\u2013section and\ninverse aspect ratio \u01eb \u2261 a/R0 . Here, a and R0 are the minor radius of the last closed flux surface and the major radius\nof the geometric axis, respectively. Fig. 1 shows an example of the geometry of an accretion disk with a circular cross\u2013\nsection as seen in a poloidal plane with the central gravitational object at the origin. The extended Grad\u2013Shafranov\nequation has been discretized using a finite element method in combination with the standard Galerkin method. The\nelements used are isoparametric bicubic Hermite ones. These bicubic elements ensure that the computed solution has the\ndesired high accuracy (fourth order) needed for the stability analysis. FINESSE solves the elliptic PDE problem using\nthe Picard iteration scheme. The imposed boundary conditions assume that the fixed boundary represents the last closed\nflux surface. The same FINESSE code can actually handle the more general case of stationary MHD equilibrium with\nnon\u2013vanishing poloidal flows as well, but here we restrict our discussion to equilibria with purely toroidal flows.\n5.2. The spectral code PHOENIX\nThe spectral code PHOENIX developed by van der Holst (Blokland et al. 2006) is used for the stability analysis of\na two dimensional accretion disk. PHOENIX can compute the complete MHD spectrum for a given two dimensional\nequilibrium, toroidal mode number n, and a range of poloidal mode numbers m. A range of poloidal mode numbers is\nneeded due to the mode coupling caused by allowing for a non\u2013circular cross\u2013section, gravitational stratification, and\nthe toroidal geometry of the accretion disk. PHOENIX does not directly solve the spectral equation (33), but instead\nemploys the linearised version of the full set of MHD Eqs. (1)\u2013(4). These linearised equations are then discretized using\na finite element method in the normal \u03c8\u2013direction, a spectral method in the poloidal direction and a standard Galerkin\nmethod is used to obtain a linear generalised eigenvalue problem for the eigenfrequencies \u03c9. The elements used in the \u03c8\u2013\ndirection for the perturbed quantities are a combination of quadratic and cubic Hermite elements to prevent the creation\nof spurious eigenvalues (Rappaz 1977). This results in a non\u2013Hermitian eigenvalue problem, which is solved using the\nJacobi\u2013Davidson method (Sleijpen & van der Vorst 1996). The boundary conditions used for the perturbations are those\nof a perfect conducting wall. Strictly speaking, these conditions can not be applied to waves and instabilities that appear\ninside an accretion disk. However, if the wave phenomena are sufficiently localised or not significantly affected by the\nposition of the wall, these boundary conditions have hardly any influence. This is particularly true for the continuous\nbranches of the MHD spectrum on which we concentrate in what follows. These modes are purely localised on a flux\nsurface, and are not affected by the wall. Like FINESSE, PHOENIX can handle poloidal flows as well, but we have\nexploit it here for equilibria with toroidal flow only.\nThe continuous spectrum is computed by a less expensive method introduced by Poedts & Schwarz (1993). In this\nmethod, on each individual flux surface the cubic Hermite and the quadratic elements are replaced by log(\u01eb) and 1/\u01eb,\nrespectively. Due to this replacement, the singular behaviour of the continuous spectrum has been approximated by\nthe perturbed quantities. This singular behaviour has been described by Goedbloed (1975) and Pao (1975) for static,\naxisymmetric and toroidal plasma. Recently, the analogous treatment has been used by Goedbloed et al. (2004a) for\nplasmas with toroidal and poloidal flows and gravity. The resulting eigenvalue problem is then a small algebraic problem\nof a size set by the range in poloidal mode numbers m on each flux surface, and is then solved using a direct QR method\nand a scan over all flux surfaces. This yields detailed information on all MHD continua.\n\n6. Accretion disks with density as a flux function\nWe present our numerical results on disk equilibria and stability using the codes described in the previous section. For the\nequilibrium computations the ratio of the specific heats \u03b3 = 5/3 and the gravitational potential is an external Newtonian\n\n\f10\n\nJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n\u221a\none, i.e. \u03a6 = \u2212GM\u2217 / R2 + Z 2 , where G and M\u2217 are the gravitational constant and the mass of the central object,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we assume that the density is a flux function for all equilibrium computations. From our\ntheoretical analysis above, this is the relevant case which may give rise to damped stable and overstable continuum mode\npairs due to the presence of toroidal flow and gravity.\n6.1. Thin accretion disk with constant density\nAs the first case, we take an accretion disk with constant density as also presented by Blokland et al. (2006). The\nequilibrium is described by the following flux functions:\nI 2 (\u03c8) = A(1 \u2212 0.0385\u03c8 + 0.02\u03c8 2 + 0.00045\u03c8 3),\np0 (\u03c8) = AB(1 \u2212 0.9\u03c8),\n\n\u03c1(\u03c8) = 1,\n\u03a9(\u03c8) = C(1 \u2212 0.9\u03c8 2 ),\n\n(58)\n\nwhere the values of the coefficients A, B, and C are given by 112, 0.01, and 0.1. Furthermore, the considered poloidal\ncross-section is circular and the inverse aspect ratio \u01eb = 0.1. In these calculations, GM\u2217 = 1 after scaling with respect to\na reference density, the vacuum magnetic field, and the minor radius of the accretion disk. Fig. 2 shows the computed\ntwo\u2013dimensional pressure and plasma beta \u03b2(= 2p/B 2 ) profile. The pressure decreases monotonically outwards due to\nthe fact that the term proportional to the gravitational potential \u03a6 dominates in the pressure equation (13). In contrast,\nthe plasma beta increases monotonically outwards from 0.63 at the inner part to 0.76 at the outer part of the disk. The\nratio v\u03c6 /vKepler = [0.085, 1.049], where vKepler is the Keplerian velocity.\n\nFig. 2. The two\u2013dimensional pressure (gray\u2013scale) and plasma beta \u03b2 = 2p/B 2 (contours) profile for an accretion disk\nwith constant density. The cross\u2013section is circular and the inverse aspect ratio \u01eb = 0.1. The central object is to the left\nof the figure.\nThe computation of the continuous spectrum of this equilibrium is done for toroidal mode number n = \u22121 and\npoloidal mode numbers m = [\u22123, 5]. Fig. 3 shows the sub\u2013spectrum of the MHD continua. The plots clearly indicate the\nexistence of stable and overstable modes in the MHD continua. The plots (a) and (b) show the real and imaginary part\n\u221a\nof the eigenfrequencies \u03c9 that belong to the continuous spectrum as a function of the radial flux coordinate s \u2261 \u03c8.\nThe frequencies of the continua in the complex plane are shown in the plot (c). It should be noted that it is difficult\nto label the different branches of the MHD continua by a \"dominant\" poloidal mode number m. This could be done by\nmaking use of analytical expressions for an infinitely slender torus (\u01eb \u2192 0), but then the gravity of the central object\nwould be neglected. In our case, these expressions can hardly be used to identify the different branches of the MHD\ncontinua, because gravity plays a dominant role in the equilibrium as well as in the spectral analysis. Notice that in plot\n(a) two branches merge at s \u2248 0.59, while at the same location the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency starts to become\nnon\u2013zero. Intricate mode couplings thus give rise to the emergence of pairs of overstable and damped stable modes.\nNext, we investigate the influence of the external gravitational potential on the overstable modes presented in the\nprevious figure. This is done by varying the mass of the central object GM\u2217 . The result is shown in Fig. 4, where\nthe most overstable mode of the MHD continua is plotted as function of the gravitational potential on the magnetic\naxis RM . Notice that each point in this plot corresponds to a different equilibrium calculated with FINESSE. PHOENIX\nis used to analyse the stability of the computed equilibrium. The gravitational potential is stabilizing from 0 to -0.01 and\ndestabilizing from -0.01 to lower values. The zero value corresponds to a toroidally rotating, non-gravitating \"tokamak\"\n\n\fJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n11\n\nplasma. Its instability is in agreement with the results by van der Holst et al. (2000a). Fig. 5 shows the projected BruntV\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency for the points (a), (b), and (c) indicated in Fig. 4. Plot (a) shows that the minimum value of this\nfrequency is reached inside the plasma, while plot (c) shows that this value is reached at the edge of the accretion disk.\nPoint (b) is the transition from the minimum value inside to the edge of the disk as seen in plot (b).\n6.2. Thin accretion disks with non\u2013constant density\nTo model a more realistic accretion disk equilibrium, we allow a density gradient across the poloidal magnetic surfaces.\nAll other flux functions are kept as in the previous case, i.e.\nI 2 (\u03c8) = A(1 \u2212 0.0385\u03c8 + 0.02\u03c8 2 + 0.00045\u03c8 3),\np0 (\u03c8) = AB(1 \u2212 0.9\u03c8),\n\n\u03c1(\u03c8) = 1 \u2212 0.4\u03c8,\n\n\u03a9(\u03c8) = C(1 \u2212 0.9\u03c8 2 ),\n\n(59)\n\nwhere the coefficients A, B, C are given by 91.5, 0.01, and 0.1. Also in this case, the poloidal cross\u2013section is circular, the\ninverse aspect ratio \u01eb = 0.1, and the scaled mass of the central object is GM\u2217 = 1. The two\u2013dimensional pressure and\nplasma beta profile are shown in Fig. 6. This profile shows that the pressure reaches its maximum within the disk, instead\nof at the inner boundary of the disk, as in the case of a constant density. This difference can be explained as follows.\nHere, also the term p0 \u03a6(R, Z)/T\u03c1 = \u03c1\u03a6(R, Z) dominates in the pressure equation (13), but, due to the small inverse\naspect ratio, the variation in the gravitational potential is small compared to the one in the density. This implies that the\ndensity, which is a flux function, mainly determines the shape of the dominant term in the Eq. (13). The temperature\n(not shown) decreases monotonically outwards. The range of plasma beta \u03b2 = [0.082, 0.158] and its maximum value is\nreached within the accretion disk. These low values for the plasma beta imply that the disk is strongly magnetized.\nFurthermore, the range of the ratio v\u03c6 /vKepler = [0.085, 1.044].\nFor this case, the continuous spectrum has been computed for toroidal mode number n = 1 and poloidal mode\nnumbers m = [\u22123, 5]. The results are shown in Fig. 7, which\u221acontains two plots. In the left one, the real part of\nthe eigenvalues is plotted against the \"radial\" coordinate s \u2261 \u03c8, while the right one shows the eigenvalues in the\ncomplex plane. For this case, there are neither purely exponential unstable or overstable modes. Due to the presence\nof toroidal flow, gravity and a non\u2013constant density, it is possible to create new or wider gaps between the different\nMHD continuum branches, with avoided crossings as a result of poloidal mode couplings. This has been shown by van\nder Holst et al. (2000b) for tokamak equilibria with toroidal flow. In these gaps, there may exist global modes similar\nto the Toroidal Flow\u2013induced Alfv\u00e9n Eigenmode (TFAE) for tokamaks found by van der Holst et al. (2000a) or to the\nStratification\u2013induced Alfv\u00e9n Eigenmode (SAE) for coronal flux tubes found by Beli\u00ebn et al. (1996). We will investigate\nthis possibility for novel global modes in accretion disk context in future work.\n6.3. Thick accretion disk\nNext, we increase the inverse aspect ratio \u01eb from 0.1 to 0.5, while keeping all other quantities the same. Again, the\npoloidal cross\u2013section is chosen circular. The resulting pressure profile is presented in Fig. 8. Here, The pressure decreases\nmonotonically outward, similar to the equilibrium with constant density. Again, the term \u03c1\u03a6(R, Z) dominates in the\npressure equation (13). The inverse aspect ratio is now not small so that both the gravitational potential and the density\ndetermines the shape of the pressure profile. Also in this case, the temperature decreases in the outward direction. The\nplasma beta \u03b2 of this accretion disk ranges from 0.237 up to 0.970 and reaches its maximum within the disk. The\ndeviation from a Keplerian disk is expressed by the ratio v\u03c6 /vKepler = [0.007, 0.282]. Thus the disk completely rotates\nsub-Keplerian.\nFor this equilibrium, the continuous MHD spectrum is computed, again for toroidal mode number n = \u22121 and poloidal\nmode numbers m = [\u22123, 5]. A part of the spectra is plotted in Fig. 9. Plot (a) shows the real part of\u221athe continuous MHD\nspectrum, while plot (c) shows the imaginary part as a function of the radial flux coordinate s \u2261 \u03c8. Plot (c) contains\nthe eigenfrequencies plotted in the complex plane. This shows the existence of overstable modes in a thick accretion disk\ndue to the presence of toroidal flow and gravity. If one carefully examines the plot (a) one sees that one of the continuum\nbranches splits in two at s \u2248 0.87, where the imaginary part becomes zero and at s \u2248 0.91 that these two continuum\nbranches merge again, whereas the imaginary part becomes non\u2013zero.\n6.4. Maximum growth rate of the MHD continua of thin and thick accretion disks\nThe last two cases only differ by the value of the inverse aspect ratio \u01eb. We have systematically investigated the influence\nof this ratio on the existence of overstable modes by varying its value, while keeping all other equilibria quantities\nconstant. In this parametric study, we essentially move the disk torus radially inwards while keeping the radius of the\nlast closed flux surface a constant. We then gradually evolve from the equilibrium shown in Fig. 6 (\u01eb = 0.1) to the one\nshown in Fig. 8 (\u01eb = 0.5). The growth rate of the most overstable continuum mode is plotted as a function of the inverse\naspect ratio \u01eb in Fig. 10. Each point of the figure represents an equilibrium computed by FINESSE, from which the MHD\ncontinua is computed by PHOENIX. In this figure, one can clearly see that no overstable modes are present in these\ndisks for \u01eb = [0.10, 0.24]. From \u01eb = 0.24 up to 0.32, there is a strong increase of the growth rate of the most overstable\nmode, while from \u01eb = 0.32 up to at least 0.50 the growth rate remains approximately the same.\n\n\f12\n\nJ. W. S. Blokland et al.: Unstable MHD continuous spectrum of accretion disks\n\n7. Conclusions\nWe have presented the equations describing an axisymmetric MHD accretion disk equilibrium and used FINESSE to find\nnumerical solutions. We have considered thin as well as thick disks with a plasma beta of the order 0.1 where the largest\npart of the disk rotates sub\u2013Keplerian. The numerical solutions show that the pressure profile can only decrease in the\noutward direction if the gravitational potential dominates in the pressure equation (13).\nThe stability of the disk equilibria have been analysed theoretically as well as numerically. From theory, a stability\ncriterion has been derived which closely resembles the Schwarzschild criterion. It is shown that in a disk where the density\nis a flux function, the MHD continua can turn overstable due to the presence of toroidal rotation and gravity. This\ninstability is not possible for disks where the temperature or the entropy is a flux function. The numerical results support\nour theoretical conclusion. The effect of the gravity on the overstable modes can either be stabilizing or destabilizing.\nIn the case of non\u2013constant density the inverse aspect ratio \u01eb has been varied. This study shows that the continua turn\noverstable if the inverse aspect ratio is larger than a certain critical value, approximately 0.24. These localised instabilities\nwill lead to small\u2013scale, turbulent dynamics when the equilibria are used in initial conditions for non\u2013linear simulations.\nThis dynamics is unrelated the usual magneto\u2013rotational instability. Indeed, these instabilities, as well as the poloidal\nflow driven unstable continuum modes investigated by Goedbloed et al. 2004a, provide a new route to MHD turbulence\nin accretion disks. Furthermore, due to the presence of gravity, it is possible to widen or create new gaps in the MHD\ncontinua. It is possible to show this theoretically by expanding the eigenfunctions in poloidal harmonics. In these gaps\nnew types of global ideal MHD eigenmodes can exist. The investigation of these global eigenmodes is left for future work.\nAcknowledgements.
