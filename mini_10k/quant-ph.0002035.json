This effective interaction will force the total system of\nthe BEC plus the light field to evolve from a factorized initial state to an ideal entangled state\nand thus result in the quantum decoherence in the BEC. Since the effective coupling coefficients\nare mainly determined by the Rabi frequency of the pump laser, the quantum decoherence process\ncan be controlled by adjusting the intensity of the pump laser. To study the physical influence of\ndecoherence on the BEC, we investigate how the coherent tunneling of BEC in a well-separated tight\ndouble wall is suppressed by the effectively-entangled vacuum modes.\n\nPACS numbers:03.65,03.75-b,42.50.-p,42.50.Ct,42.50.Dv\n\ndecoherence without dissipation can not be modeled directly based on the usual electromagnetic coupling. To\ndetect the quantum decoherence phenomenon clearly in\na practical experiment, it is essential to find a reallyphysical environment to produce quantum decoherence\npurely without quantum dissipation. Fortunately, the\nabove mentioned far off-resonant light scattering on BEC\ncan just induce such an environment coupling to BEC\nsystem purely with decoherence. Since the effective coupling coefficients are determined mainly by the Rabi frequency of the pump laser, the quantum decoherence process can be controlled by adjusting the intensity of the\npump laser. To study the physical effect of decoherence\nin the BEC, we consider how the coherent tunneling of\nBEC in a well-separated tight double wall is suppressed\nby the effectively -entangled vacuum modes.\nFollowing Moore and Meystre et al [5], we consider\nthe Schreodinger fields of two-level atoms coupled to a\nclassical pump laser field far-off resonant as well as to\nthe quantized vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field,\nvia the electric-dipole interaction. For the large detuning\nbetween the pump frequency and the atomic transition\nfrequency, the excited state field can be eliminated adiabatically and then all atoms can be described by a scalar\nfield \u03a8\u0302g (r) of the ground state. The corresponding effective Hamiltonian is given by [5]\nZ\nX\n\u0124 = d3 r\u03a8\u0302\u2020g (r)HA \u03a8\u0302g (r) +\nh\u0304\u03c9k a\u2020k ak + HAA\n\nRecently, some important developments in Bose Einstein condensates (BEC) of trapped atomic vapors [1,2]\nhave been achieved in connection with light scattering\nof BEC, such as the Bragg scattering [3]and Rayleigh\nscattering in various cases where the atoms interact only\nwith far off-resonant optical fields [4]. The super-radiant\nRayleigh scattering by the BEC was observed in a recent experiment by Ketterle and his co-workers at MIT.\nIt was also demonstrated [5] [6] that, when the far offresonant laser light is scattered into the vacuum modes\nof the electro-magnetic field, the dominant two-photon\ninteraction can optically manipulate matter-wave coherence properties to generate a quai-CW atomic laser and\nthe so called atomic four-wave mixing from BEC [3]. In\nthis paper we will probe into the problem whether the\nfar off-resonant pump light scattering from a classical\npumped mode to many-vacuum modes can generate an\nideal entanglement between atomic and optical fields and\nthen demolish the quantum coherence of the scattered\ncondensate. Especially we will consider how to use the\npump laser to control the quantum decoherence process\nof BEC [7].\nUsually, an interaction between a quantum system and\nan environment can cause two types of quantum irreversible effects: quantum dissipation indicating the loss\nof the system energy, and quantum decoherence indicating the leaking out of coherent information while the system energy is conserved. In the study of irreversible\nprocess in the trapped BEC, progress has been made\nby adopting particular forms of coupling between BEC\natoms and the environment,or in other words,by modeling the decoherence [7]. For BEC system, the natural\norigin of environment coupling is the interaction between\nBEC atoms and the background electromagnetic field or\nthe thermal atomic cloud. It is noticed that this kind\nof interaction can also change the energy of BEC and\nthus can also lead to a quantum dissipation. So a pure\n\nk\n\nZ\nX\n+(\nh\u0304gk d3 r\u03a8\u0302\u2020g (r)\u03a8\u0302g (r)ak ei(k\u2212k0 )*r + H.c), (1)\nk\n\nR\nwhere HAA = h\u0304\u03be d3 r[\u03a8\u0302\u2020g \u03a8\u0302\u2020g \u03a8\u0302g \u03a8\u0302g ] denotes two -body\ninteratomic interaction measured by the scattering length\nh\u03042\n2\na of s \u2212 wave and \u03be = 4\u03c0h\u0304a\nM ; HA =\u2212 2M \u2207 + V (r) is the\nfree Hamiltonian for single atom of mass M in an effective\n1\n\n\f2\n\n\u2020\ntrap V (r) = Vg (r) + h\u0304R\n2\u2206 ; ak and ak are the creation and\nannihilation operators for the vacuum electromagnetic\nfield with frequency \u03c9k = ck \u2212 \u03c90 for k = |k|, c being the\nspeed of light. The effective trap V (r) was obtained from\nthe trap potential Vg (r) for the ground state with modification by the coupling strength R (Rabi frequency )\nbetween the atoms under consideration and \u221a\nthe classical\npump filed of frequency \u03c90 = ck0 , and R(\u221d I)depends\non the pump intensity I. With respect to the atomic\ntransition frequency \u03c9a , the detuning \u2206 =\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9a is very\nlarge. Particularly,\nit \u221a\nis noticed that the coupling coef\u221a\nk\nIk\nficient gk \u221d |R|\n\u221d\n2|\u2206|\n2|\u2206| [5]. So, in principle, one can\ncontrol the quantum dynamic processes of BEC resulting\nfrom the coupling to the vacuum, such as the quantum\ndecoherence.\nWhen the BEC happens in a single trap Vg (r), the\natomic field \u03a8\u0302g (r) can be approximately quantized as [8]\n\u03a8\u0302g (r) \u223c b0 \u03c60 where \u03c60 is the wave function of the ground\nstate of energy E0 = h\u0304\u03a9 and b0 is its annihilation operator obeying [b0 , b\u20200 ] = 1. Then, the effective Hamiltonian\ntakes the form\n2\n\u0124e = h\u0304\u03a9b\u20200 b0 + h\u0304\u03bab\u20202\n0 b0 +\nX\nX\nh\u0304\u03c9k a\u2020k ak + b\u20200 b0 (\nh\u0304\u03b7k ak + H.c),\nk\n\nwhere \u01eb(n) = n(\u03a90 \u2212 \u03ba) + \u03ban2 is the Hartree-Fock energy\nof the BEC. The overlaps Omn = hvm |vn i, which are\ncalled decoherence factors, can be calculated directly as\nfollows\nY\nn\nOmn =\nh\u03b1m\nk |\u03b1k i\nk\n\n= exp[\u2212\n\nk\n\nexp[\n\n\u03b3nk\n\n(m \u2212 n)2\n\ni(m2 \u2212 n2 )\n\n\u03c9k t\ngk2\nsin2 (\n)] \u00d7\n2\n\u03c9k\n2\n\n(5)\n\ngk2\n(\u03c9k t \u2212 sin(\u03c9k t))]\n\u03c9k2\n\nIt characterizes the extent of entanglement and has a\nfactorized structure [9]with respect to the individual\nmode k of the \"environment\". All necessary information about the decoherence effects of the vacuum environment on the BEC are contained in the decoherence factor. The zero overlap means an ideal entanglement and thus leads to a complete decoherence. In fact,\nif hvm |vn i = 0 for m 6= n,the reduced density \u03c1 matrix of atoms have the vanishing off-diagonal elements\n\u03c1mn = ei[\u01eb(m)\u2212\u01eb(n)]thvm |vn i \u2192 0.\nUsing the explicit\nR\nP expression of gk given in ref. [5], we\nreplace the sum\nk (...) in Eq.(6) with an integral\n\u03bc(k)(...)k 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6dk where\u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar variables of the wave vector k. For the isotropic spectral\ndistribution (effective mode density) of the vacuum field,\nwe can explicitly calculate the norm of the decoherence\nfactors:\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nngk \u2212i\u03c9k t\n=\n(e\n\u2212 1])\ni\u03c9k\nn2 |gk |2\n=\n[\u03c9k t \u2212 sin(\u03c9k t)]\n\u03c9k2\n\nX\nk\n\nR 3 \u2217\ni(k\u2212k0 )*r\nand \u03ba =\nwhere\nR 3 \u03b7k = 4 h\u0304gk d r\u03c60 (r)\u03c60 (r)e\n\u03be d r|\u03c60 (r)| .The above Hamiltonian describes a typical quantum decoherence process since the effective inP\nteraction HI = b\u20200 b0 [ k h\u0304\u03b7k ak + H.c] commutes with\n2\nthe free BEC Hamiltonian H0 = h\u0304\u03a9b\u20200 b0 + h\u0304\u03bab\u20202\n0 b0 , i.e.,\n[HI , H0 ] = 0 [9]. However, HI can still induce a virtual transition, in which the atomic internal state remains unchanged. But it should be noticed that since\n[HI , HL ] 6= 0, this transition may result in a backaction on the vacuum light field of the free Hamiltonian\nP\nHL = k h\u0304\u03c9k a\u2020k ak .\nFor example, when an atom in the Fock state |ni =\n\u221a1 b\u2020n |ni absorbs a pump photon and then emits a pump\nn! 0\nphoton, the vacuum light field\nPexperiences different recoil\nkicks described by Hn = n( k h\u0304\u03b7k ak + H.c) where n is\nthe atom number. After time t , this external forced\nterm will drive the vacuum light field to evolve into a\nproduct state |vn i = \u03a0k ei\u03b3nk (t) |\u03b1nk i of coherent states\n|\u03b1nk (t)i = exp[\u03b1nk (t)a\u2020k \u2212 H.c]|0i where [9]\n\u03b1nk (t)\n\nX\n\n|Omn (t)| = exp[\u2212(m \u2212 n)2\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c0R2 cd2\n\u00d7\n8(2\u03c0)3 h\u0304\u22062\n\nsin2 ( 2t [ck \u2212 \u03c90 ])k 3\n\u03bc(k)dk]\u00d7\n(ck \u2212 \u03c90 )2\n\n(6)\n\nIn the free space with \u03bc(k) = 1, the integral in the above\nEq.(6) diverges to positive infinity and thus Omn (t) approaches zero. This leads to the instantaneous quantum\ndecoherence of the BEC. However, if we put the system\ninto a micro-cavity, the effective mode density \u03bc(k) will\nchange singularly [10]. In this case \u03bc(k) may take certain special forms so that the integral does not diverge\nto positive infinity. For instance, in a special case where\n\u03bc(k) = k\u03be3 ,\n\u22121\n\n|Omn | = e\u2212\u03bbmn [\u03c0t\u22122+2\u03c90\n\ncos(\u03c90 t)+2 Si(\u03c90 t)t]\n\n(7)\n\nRz\n2 2 2\nR d\nand Si(z) = 0 sinx x dx is a\nwhere \u03bbmn = \u03be(m\u2212n)\n256\u03c0 2 h\u0304\u22062\nspecial function. Figure.1(a-b) illustrates the decoherence processes for different \u03bbmn and \u03c90 .What is of high\ninterest is the fact that the damping rate of quantum coherence described by \u03c1mn \u221d Omn depends on both the\nfrequency \u03c90 of the pump light field and its coupling\nstrength R to the BEC. Thus there arises a possibility\nfor one to control the happening of the quantum decoherence.\n\n(3)\n\nTherefore, the total system formed by the BEC plus\nthe vacuum\nP field can evolve from a factorized initial state\n|\u03a8(0)i = n=0 cn |ni \u2297 |0i to an entangled state\nX\n|\u03a8(t)i =\ncn e\u2212i\u01eb(n)t |ni \u2297 |vn i\n(4)\nn=0\n\n2\n\n\fX\n(\nh\u0304(\u03bck N + \u03b6 k T)ak + H.c),\n\nOn the other hand, the leading damping term\n2 2 2\nR d\n\u03bbmn \u03c0= \u03be(m\u2212n)\n, which plays a role in the decoher256\u03c0h\u0304\u22062\nence process for much longer time , does not depends\non \u03c90 , so in a long time scale only different R (or \u03bbmn )\ncan notably change the decaying behavior of quantum\ncoherence. Figure.1a shows this result qualitatively. It\nis clearly seen in Figure .1b that the curves |Omn (t)| almost remain unchanged for different \u03c90 . Therefore, one\ncan artificially control the quantum dynamic process of\ndecoherence for the BEC by adjusting the physical parameter, namely, the intensity of the classical pump laser.\nAs shown above quantum decoherence can only happen for the superposition of the Fock states of different\natomic numbers. If we understand BEC state as a Fock\nstate with definite atomic number N , no quantum decoherence happens and the BEC is certainly robust. However, there exists a different view: an assembly of the\nBEC atoms must be assigned a definite phase and so\nthe BEC is not a number state though it has an average\natomic number N [11]. From this viewpoint a good pure\nstate description for BEC is obtained by using the coherent state,which can survive in an usual open environment\nmuch longer than the number state does [11]. Since the\nBEC coherent state is a superposition of atomic number states, the quantum decoherence can be induced by\nthe Rayleigh scattering far-off-resonance. By testing the\ndifferent effects of decoherence for the number state and\nthe coherent state, we can judge which of the two views\nconcerning BEC reflects the physical reality better.\nTo further analyses the influences of decoherence on\nBEC, we consider atomic tunneling in the BEC formed in\na symmetric double-well atomic trap [8], whose potential\nV (r) has two well separated minima at x = \u00b1 a2 . Assume\nthe potential is such that the two lowest states \u03c60 (r) and\n\u03c61 (r) with even and odd parities are closely spaced and\nwell separated from higher \u221a\nlevels. Their energy difference\n1 \u22122\u03bea\ne\nwhere \u03be = 2M V0 depends on the height\nh\u0304\u03b4 \u221d M\u03be\nof maxima of the double-well potential. In this case with\nvery large \u03be, the interactions with the atoms in higher\nlevels do not significantly change the dynamics of atoms\nin the two lowest states. Thus, a two-mode approximation is permitted for the many-body description of the\nBEC system [8]. In this way we can quantize the atomic\nfields as\n\u03a8\u0302g (r) \u223c b0 \u03c60 + b1 \u03c61 = br \u03c6r + bl \u03c6l\n\n(9)\n\nk\n\nfor the double-well BEC scattered by a far-off resonance light. Here, N =b\u2020l bl + b\u2020r br is the total atomic\nnumber and T =bl b\u2020r + br b\u2020l is the tunnelling operator between the two minima. The corresponding tunneling frequency is just the transition frequency \u03b4 of\nthe two non-local motional modes \u03c60 and \u03c61 . Here,\nthe effective coupling\nR constants \u03bck and \u03b6k are definedR by \u03bck = h\u0304gk d3 r\u03c6\u2217l (r)\u03c6l (r)ei(k\u2212k0 )*r and \u03b6k =\nh\u0304gk d3 r\u03c6\u2217l (r)\u03c6r (r)ei(k\u2212k0 )*r .\nIf the BEC system is initially prepared in the left\nlocal mode, we describe it by a coherent state |\u03b1il =\nP\u221e\n\u03b1n\n\u2212 21 |\u03b1|2 \u221a\n.

The atomic tunneling is usually\ncharacterized by the population difference between two\ncondensates\np(t) = hb\u2020r br \u2212 b\u2020l bl i = 2 Re(hb\u20201 b0 i)\n\n(8)\n\n= 2 Re{\n\n\u221e n\u22121\nX\nX\n\nn=0 m=0\n\nwhere we have introduced the annihilation operators br,l\n= \u221a12 (b0 \u00b1 b1 ) for the right and the left local modes\n\u03c6r,l (r) = \u221a12 [\u03c60 (r) \u00b1\u03c61 (r)]. If the position uncertainty\nin the states \u03c6l (r) and \u03c6r (r) is much less than the separation of the minima of the global potential V (r) , the\nlocal modes may be treated as orthogonal modes and\n[br , b\u2020l ] \u223c 0. Then, neglecting the interatomic interaction\nwe can write down the effective Hamiltonian\nX\n\u0124e = h\u0304\u03a9N + h\u0304\u03b4T+\nh\u0304\u03c9k a\u2020k ak +\n\nn n\u2217\nfm+1\n|cn |2 fm\n\n(11)\n\np\n(m + 1)(n \u2212 m)Om }\n\nn\nn\nwhere Om = hvm+1\n(t)|vm\n(t)iis the decoherence factor\nfor the entangling vacuum fields. According to Eq.(9),\nwe can roughly write Om \u2248 JeimS [9]for the real timedependent functions J(t) and R(t) and then calculate out\nthe population difference in a compact form\n2\niR\n1\np(t) = Re(\u2212J\u03b12 e 2 (1\u2212e )\u03b1 e2i\u03b4t )\n2\niS\n1\n= \u2212J\u03b12 cos(2\u03b4t) Re e 2 (1\u2212e )\u03b1 +\n2\niS\n1\n\u2212J\u03b12 sin(2\u03b4t) Re(ie 2 (1\u2212e )\u03b1 )\n\nk\n\n3\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhere J(t) = |Om | is a damping factor similar to that in\nEq.(6).\nThe above result answers the following natural question: what is the effect of decoherence on the quantum\ncoherent atomic tunneling ? It indicates that the decoherence always tends to suppress the atomic tunneling current between the two condensates since J(t) is\ndecaying with time t. The similar observation was even\nmade by Kuang et.al most recently [7], but our result\nseems to be more clearly. Without quantum decoherence ( Om = 1) the atomic tunneling manifests a simple\nharmonic oscillation, p(t) = \u03b12 cos(2\u03b4t). Generally it is\nmodified with a decaying factor J(t) and a phase shift \u03b8\ndefined by\ntan \u03b8 =\n\n2\niS\n1\nRe e 2 (1\u2212e )\u03b1\n1\n\niS )\u03b12\n\nRe(ie 2 (1\u2212e\n\n)\n\ndissipation caused by spontaneous emission can be controlled by the cavity, it is natural to expect that quantum\ndecoherence,which is another quantum irreversible process, can also be controlled . We will study,in the future\nresearch, the quantum decoherence of the BEC system\nunder the influence of cavity field with various spectral\ndensity in details.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported in part by the National Foundation of Natural Science of China.\n\n(13)\n\nIn Figure 2 we show this modification by plotting the\ntime-dependent curves of p(t) for different \u03b8 and J(t).\nWe have shown that a strong far off-resonant pump\nlaser applied to a BEC can produce quantum entanglement between the BEC and the many-mode quantized\nvacuum field. It thus can result in quantum decoherence in the BEC. One of the most interesting indications\nof this observation is the possibility to control the dynamic processes of the BEC decoherence in the BEC by\nengineering the coupling between the BEC and its environment. We notice the effective coupling coefficients gk\nor \u03bck and \u03b6k are determined by the Rabi frequency R of\nthe pump laser and the pump frequency \u03c90 . Therefore,\nthe quantum decoherence process can be controlled by\nadjusting the intensity of the pump laser and the pump\nfrequency \u03c90 . It can be seen from Eq.(6) that the norm\nof the decoherence factor is more sensitive to the intensity of the pump laser than to the pump frequency \u03c90 .\nSo the dominant element governing the induced quantum\ndecoherence of the BEC is the intensity of the pump laser\nrather than the pump frequency \u03c90 . The above discussion in this paper is echoed by current experiments. For\ninstance, a recent experiment by Ketterle's group studied\na condensate driven by a far-off resonant pump laser. Its\ngeneralization maybe clearly demonstrate many aspects\nof the present theoretical investigation for engineering the\ndecoherence theory of BEC. In fact, certain engineered\nenvironments have been implemented recently to observe\nthe decoherence of ion and cooled atom systems quantitatively [12].\nThere also exists another way to engineer the induced\nenvironment around the BEC so that the quantum decoherence can be controlled effectively, that is, to put the\nsystem in a an optical micro-cavity so that the spectral\ndensity \u03bc(k) of the vacuum fields can be changed dramatically by the boundary of cavity. In fact [10], as a classic aspect of cavity quantum electromagnetic theory, the\nsuppression and enhancement of spontaneous emission of\natom within the cavity has been studied in many theoretical and experimental investigations.
