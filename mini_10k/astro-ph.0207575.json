Introduction\nIt is commonly accepted that in non-pulsating neutron\nstar X-ray binaries the magnetic field of the neutron\nstar is weak enough and the accretion disk can extend\nclose to the surface of a neutron star. If the neutron\nstar rotation frequency is smaller than the Keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the disk, a boundary layer\nwill be formed near the surface of the neutron star in\nwhich the accreting matter decelerates and spreads over\nstar's surface (Sunyaev & Shakura, 1986; Kluzniak, 1988;\nInogamov & Sunyaev, 1999; Popham & Sunyaev, 2001).\nFor a non-rotating neutron star, in Newtonian approximation half of the energy release due to accretion would\ntake place in the boundary/spread layer. The effects of\nthe general relativity can increase this fraction, e.g. up to\n\u223c 2/3 in the case of a neutron star with radius RNS = 3Rg\n(Sunyaev & Shakura, 1986; Sibgatullin & Sunyaev, 2000).\nRotation of the neutron star and deviations of the spacetime geometry from Schwarzschild metric further modify the fraction of the energy released on the star's surface. Consequently, a luminous spectral component, corresponding to the boundary layer emission is expected be\nSend offprint requests to: gilfanov@mpa-garching.mpg.de\n\npresent in the X-ray spectrum of a neutron star X-ray\nbinary\nX-ray observations of neutron star LMXBs in the\nhigh luminosity state reveal rather soft composite Xray spectra. Based on theoretical expectations they are\nusually represented as a sum of two components attributed to the optically thick emission of the accretion disk (Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973) and of the boundary layer/neutron star surface (Mitsuda et al., 1984;\nWhite et al., 1988). The spectra of these two components\nare rather similar to each other and decomposition of the\nX-ray emission into the boundary layer and accretion disk\ncomponents is often ambiguous, especially when based\non the spectral information alone. Not surprisingly, the\nbest fit parameters derived from the data of different instruments and, correspondingly, the inferred values of the\nphysically meaningful quantities are often in contradiction\nto each other (e.g. Mitsuda et al., 1984; Di Salvo et al.,\n2001; Done et al., 2002). A robust and sufficiently model\nindependent method of separating the boundary layer and\ndisk emission is of interest.\nMitsuda et al.

They interpreted the hard\nand soft components as emission from the neutron star\nsurface and from the optically thick accretion disk respectively and concluded that the optically thick disk is stable on the timescales considered. The latter conclusion is\nin accord with the finding of Churazov et al. (2001), who\nshowed that the same is true in the high luminosity state\n2\nof the black hole binary Cyg X-1. On time scales <\n\u223c 10\nsec the fractional amplitude of variations of the disk emission is at least an order of magnitude lower than that of\nthe hard Comptonized component. These results indicate\nthat a low level of variability might be an intrinsic property of the optically thick accretion disk, independent of\nthe nature of the compact object.\nAs is well known (see van der Klis, 1986, 2000, for review), aperiodic variability of X-ray flux from LMXBs can\nbe broadly divided into two main phenomena \u2013 continuum noise and quasi-periodical oscillations (QPO) with\nfrequencies ranging from several mHz to more than a thousand Hz (e.g. Hasinger & van der Klis, 1989; van der Klis,\n2000; Revnivtsev et al., 2001). Mitsuda et al. (1984) studied the difference between the spectra averaged at different intensity levels \u2013 that restricted the range of accessi3\nble time scales to >\n\u223c 10 sec. In this paper we will exploit\nthe technique of Fourier frequency resolved spectroscopy\n(Revnivtsev et al., 1999) to study spectral variability of\n\nFig. 2. Power spectrum of GX340+0 at the upper part of\nthe Horizontal Branch of the color-intensity diagram.\n\nluminous LMXBs on a broad range of time scales, including kHz QPO.\nAs defined in Revnivtsev et al. (1999), the Fourier frequency resolved spectrum is the energy dependent rms\namplitude in a selected frequency range, expressed in\nabsolute (as opposite to fractional) units. A similar approach was used by Mendez et al. (1997) to study the energy spectrum of kHz oscillations in 4U0614+09. One of\nit's advantages over simple fractional rms\u2013vs.\u2013energy dependence is the possibility to use conventional (i.e. response folded) spectral approximations in order to describe the energy dependence of aperiodic variability. One\nshould keep in mind, however, that the interpretation of\nthe frequency resolved spectra often is not straightforward and might strongly depend on a priori assumptions.\nNevertheless, several applications of this technique to variability of black hole binaries gave meaningful results (e.g.\nRevnivtsev et al., 1999; Gilfanov et al., 2000).\nThe simplest situation, when frequency resolved spectra can be easily interpreted is illustrated by the following\nexample. Consider a two-component spectrum, in which\none component is stable and the normalization of the other\nvaries while it's spectral shape is unchanged. In this case\nthe shape of the frequency resolved spectrum would not\ndepend on Fourier frequency and would be identical to\nthe spectrum of the variable component. The spectrum\nof the non-variable component could, in principle, be determined by subtracting the frequency resolved spectrum\nfrom the average spectrum with appropriate renormalization. Importantly, in this example the X-ray flux in\nall energy channels will vary coherently and with zero\ntime/phase lag between different energies.

This suggests, that Fourier frequency resolved spectral analysis can be applied and its\ninterpretation is sufficiently straightforward and modelindependent.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. We briefly describe the data in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we present the results\nof the observations, show that the frequency resolved spectra do not depend upon the Fourier frequency, and constrain the time lags between different energies. The initial\nobservational results are summarized in Subsect. 3.3. In\nSect. 4 we show that a particularly simple form of the\nspectral variability is required in order to satisfy the observational constraints \u2013 the flux variations in different\nenergy channels must be related by a simple linear transformation. In Sect. 5 we compare the expected spectra of\nthe disk and boundary layer emission with the frequency\nresolved spectra. We show that the observed aperiodic\n1\n\u223c 150\u25e6 phase lag was detected in the normal branch QPO\nof Cyg X-2 with the pivot energy \u223c 5 keV, but no such lags\nwere found in a similar spectral state of Sco X-1 (Dieters et al.,\n2000)\n\nand quasiperiodic variability is primarily caused by variations of the luminosity of the boundary layer and its energy spectrum can be represented, to certain accuracy, by\nthe frequency resolved spectra. In Sect. 6 we discuss the\nboundary layer emission spectrum, it's dependence on the\nmass accretion rate and implications of these results for\ndisk and boundary layer models. The results are summarized in Sect. 7.\n\n2. The data\nIn order to investigate the spectral variability of neutron\nstar LMXBs in the soft (high luminosity) state we have\nused the RXTE/PCA (Bradt et al., 1993) observations\nof one of the bright Z-sources (Hasinger & van der Klis\n1989) GX340+0. Our choice was defined by the requirement that the PCA configuration combined sufficiently\nhigh energy resolution (large number of the energy channels) with good timing resolution and large total exposure\ntime. We selected observations from proposal P20053 performed from Sep.21 to Nov.4, 1997 with total exposure\ntime of \u2248178 ksec. The PCA configuration provided 31\nenergy channels in the 3\u201320 keV energy band with 2 msec\ntime resolution. The detailed timing analysis of these data\nwas presented earlier by Jonker et al. (2000).\nThe intensity-color diagram of GX340+0 is presented\nin Fig. 1. The Fig. 2 shows an example of the power density\nspectrum, corresponding to the beginning of the horizontal branch on the intensity-color diagram. The prominent\nQPO peak at \u223c 25 Hz corresponds to so called Horizontal\nBranch Oscillation (HBO).\n\n\f4\n\nGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nFig. 4.

The parameters\nof the Comptonized spectrum are best fit to the frequency\nresolved spectrum of the \u223c 25 Hz QPO (Table 2).\nThe kHz QPOs are known to be rather weak in the\ncase of GX340+0 (especially the upper kHz QPO), and\nthe available data on the source did not have enough sensitivity to study them in detail. Therefore, to investigate\nthe properties of two kHz QPOs and compare them with\nthe lower frequency variability we chose another bright\nLMXB, 4U1608-52. The data of proposal P30062 provide\nenergy and timing resolution adequate for this purpose.\nDetailed analysis of kHz QPOs in these observations was\npresented in Mendez et al. (1999, 2001). During these observations the source was in the high luminosity state and\nhad two strong kHz QPO peaks at frequencies \u223c 600\u2212800\nHz and \u223c 900 \u2212 1200 and somewhat weaker QPO at \u223c45\nHz (Fig. 3). Our aim is to compare the spectral variability\ncorresponding to these three QPO components.\nThe reduction of the PCA data was performed with\nthe help of standard tasks from FTOOLS/LHEASOFT,\nversion 5.1. The spectral approximations were done using\nXSPEC. In all spectral fits the interstellar absorption was\nfixed at N H = 5 * 1022 cm\u22122 and N H = 1 * 1022 cm\u22122 for\nGX340+0 and 4U1608\u201352 respectively.\n\n3.

Phase lags for GX340+0 in the Horizontal Branch\nof the color\u2013intensity diagram (Z=0\u20131) as function of energy (upper panel) and Fourier frequency (lower panel).\nThe energy dependent phase lags were computed in the\n1\u201332 Hz frequency range, the frequency dependent lags\nare between 3\u20136.5 keV and 6.5\u201313 keV energy bands. The\nphase is normalized to 0\u20131 interval.\n\nshape depends on the Fourier frequency at low frequencies\nand becomes independent of the frequency at f >\n\u223c 0.5 Hz.\nSimilar behaviour was found by van der Klis (1986) in the\ncase of another bright LMXB \u2013 Z-source GX5\u20131. In particular, it was noted, that Horizontal Branch Oscillations\nand the low frequency noise have the same, hard, fractional rms spectrum and that at lower frequencies variabilty becomes softer.\nThe upper limits on the possible variations of the spectral shape with Fourier frequency depend on the photon\nenergy and Fourier frequency and vary from \u223c 5% to\n\u223c 25% (Fig. 5). Note that in the 0.5 <\n\u223c f <\n\u223c 30 Hz frequency range these upper limits are determined by the statistical uncertainties only. At higher frequencies, f >\n\u223c 30\nHz, there might be an indication, although not statistically significant enough, of a frequency dependence of the\nspectral shape (lower panel in Fig. 5). Another conclusion\nfrom the data presented in Fig. 4, important for the following discussion, is that all frequency resolved spectra\nare significantly harder than the average source spectrum.\nThe phase lags as function of energy and Fourier frequency are shown in Fig. 6. No statistically significant\nphase lags were detected in the Horizontal Branch of\nGX340+0 with upper limit of \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 10\u22122 , where phase\n\u03c6 is normalized to the interval 0\u20131 (as opposed to 0 \u2212 2\u03c0).\n\nFig. 7.

We therefore\nhad to use for this purpose a different source \u2013 4U1608-52\n(Fig. 3). As the frequency of the kHz QPO varied during the RXTE observations we used \"shift-and-add\" technique (Mendez et al., 2001) in order to improve statistics.\n\n\f6\n\nGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nDuring the same observations the source showed a lower\nfrequency QPO at \u223c45 Hz as well.\nThe Fourier frequency resolved spectra of the two kHz\nQPOs and the HBO along with their ratios are shown\nin Fig. 7. As in the case of GX340+0, all three spectra\nare consistent with each other within the statistical uncertainties. The upper limits on possible variations of the\nspectral shape, however, are significantly less constraining,\n\u223c 30 \u2212 50% at best.\n\n3.3. Summary of the observational results\nThe results of the above analysis can be summarized as\nfollows:\n1. The shape of the frequency resolved spectra does not\ndepend or depends very weakly on the Fourier frequency. This includes the continuum band limited\nnoise component, the Horizontal Branch QPO and\nthe kHz QPOs. The constraints on possible Fourier\nfrequency dependent variations of the spectral shape\nare rather stringent for the band limited noise and\nHorizontal Branch oscillations (GX340+0) \u2013 <\n\u223c 5\u221225%\n<\nin the 0.5 >\nf\n30\nHz\nfrequency\nrange\nand\nsignifi\u223c \u223c\ncantly less restrictive for kHz QPO \u2013 <\n30\n\u2212\n50%.\n\u223c\n2. The Fourier frequency resolved spectra at all frequencies are significantly harder than the average spectrum.\n3. No statistically significant phase lags were detected in\n\u22122\nthe case of GX340+0 with upper limits of \u2206\u03c6 <\n\u223c 10\nin the 0.1 \u2212 30 Hz frequency range and 3 \u2212 17 keV\nenergy range.\n4. At low Fourier frequencies, f <\n\u223c 0.5 Hz, frequency dependent variations of the spectral shape become important \u2013 the frequency resolved spectra tend to become softer (GX340+0).\n\n4. Interpretation of the Fourier frequency resolved\nspectra\nWe show here that independence of the frequency resolved\nspectra on the Fourier frequency and the smallness of the\nphase lags observed in majority of bright LMXBs (but\nsee footnote 1) require a particularly simple form of the\nspectral variability.\nThe constancy of the spectral shape with Fourier frequency implies that the power spectrum P (E, \u03c9) can be\nrepresented as a product of two functions, one of which\ndepends on the energy and the other on the frequency\nonly. For convenience we write P (E, \u03c9) in the form:\nP (E, \u03c9) = S 2 (E) \u00d7 f 2 (\u03c9)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere non-negative functions S(E) and f (\u03c9) can be directly determined from the frequency resolved spectra.\nThe Fourier image of the light curve F (E, t) is:\nF\u0302 (E, \u03c9) = S(E) \u00d7 f (\u03c9) \u00d7 ei\u03c6(E,\u03c9)\n\n(2)\n\nIn the general case the complex argument \u03c6(E, \u03c9) can\ndepend both on Fourier frequency \u03c9 and energy E. If the\n\nphase lags between different energies are negligibly small,\n\u03c6 depends on the Fourier frequency only and the Fourier\nimage of F (E, t) is:\nF\u0302 (E, \u03c9) = S(E) \u00d7 f (\u03c9) \u00d7 ei\u03c6(\u03c9)\n\n(3)\n\nThe light curve F (E, t) can be computed via inverse\nFourier transform of F\u0302 (E, \u03c9):\nZ\nF (E, t) = d\u03c9 F\u0302 (E, \u03c9)ei\u03c9t =\nZ\n= S(E) \u00d7 d\u03c9f (\u03c9)ei\u03c6(\u03c9) ei\u03c9t =\n(4)\n= S(E) \u00d7 f (t)\nAn arbitrary function of energy can obviously be added\nto the above expression. Thus, the light curve at energy\nE should satisfy the equation:\nF (E, t) = S0 (E) + S(E) \u00d7 f (t)\n\n(5)\n\ni.e. the light curves at different energies are related by a\nlinear transformation.\nEq. (5) significantly restricts the pattern of the spectral\nvariability. Suppose that the spectrum of the source at any\ngiven moment of time can be represented as:\nF (E, t) = S0 (E) + A(t) \u00d7 S(E, p(t))\n\n(6)\n\nwhere A(t) is varying normalization, and p(t) represents\nvariations of the spectral parameter, on which the spectral\nflux at a given energy depends non-linearly (e.g. temperature, Thompson optical depth etc.). Using Taylor expansion:\nF (E, t) = S0 (E) + A(t) \u00d7 S(E, p(t)) =\n= S0 (E) + A(t) \u00d7 S(E, p0 ) +\n\u2202S(E, p0 )\n\u00d7 (p(t) \u2212 p0 ) +\n+A(t) \u00d7\n\u2202p\n1 \u2202 2 S(E, p0 )\n\u00d7 (p(t) \u2212 p0 )2 + ...\n+A(t) \u00d7\n2\n\u2202p2\n\n(7)\n\nIn order to satisfy Eq. (5), one of the following two conditions should be fulfilled: (i) p(t) = p0 = const, i.e. only\nthe normalization varies with time, or (ii) the normalization is constant and variations of the spectral parameter\nare sufficiently small, so that the terms higher than linear\nin the Taylor expansion can be neglected. Simultaneous\nvariations of comparable amplitude of the normalization\nand the spectral parameter (or of any two spectral parameters) would be consistent with observations only in the\ncase of A(t) \u00d7 (p(t) \u2212 p0 ) = const or in the case of specific\nshape of the power density spectrum of A(t) (e.g. flat).\nFrom Eq. (5) it follows that the coherence of the signals\nin any two energy bands is exactly unity, as they are related by a linear transformation. This is in agreement with\nthe observed behaviour \u2013 as illustrated by an example of\nGX340+0, shown in Fig. 8, the coherence between the\nlight curves in 3\u20136.5 and 6.5\u201313 keV energy bands is close\nto unity (see also Vaughan et al. 1994, 1999; Dieters et al.\n2000 for results for other luminous LMXBs).\n\n\fGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\n7\n\nin shape to the frequency resolved spectrum, i.e. can be\ndirectly determined from observations. The spectrum of\nthe non-variable component can, in principle, be obtained\nsubtracting S(E) from the averaged spectrum with appropriate renormalization.\nIn the second case (small variations of the spectral parameter), the energy dependence of the frequency resolved\nspectrum S(E) corresponds to the first derivative of the\nspectrum with respect to the parameter p, \u2202S(E,p)\n, which\n\u2202p\nmight differ significantly from the spectrum itself. Indeed,\nconsidering a Wien spectrum, S(E, T ) = E 2 e\u2212E/T , as\nan example (cf. Mendez et al. (1997)), the intensity variations are:\nFig. 8. GX340+0: Coherence between the light curves in\nthe 3\u20136.5 and 6.5\u201313 keV energy bands as function of frequency. No correction for the dead time effects has been\nmade.\n\n4.1. Case of black hole binaries\nThe spectral variability in the black hole binaries is more\ncomplicated than described by Eq. (5) because of the\nstrong dependence of the shape of their frequency resolved\nspectra upon the Fourier frequency (Revnivtsev et al.,\n1999),2 rather than non-zero time/phase lags observed.\nIndeed, typical values of the phase lags measured for Cyg\n\u22122\nX-1 are negligible in this context, \u2206\u03c6 <\n\u223c few \u00d7 10 (e.g\nKotov, Churazov & Gilfanov, 2001). Therefore\n\u03c6(E, \u03c9) = \u03c60 (\u03c9) + \u03c61 (E, \u03c9)\nwhere\n\u03c61 (E, \u03c9) << \u03c60 (\u03c9)\nand Eq. (3) and therefore Eq. (5) will hold with sufficient\naccuracy if condition of Eq. (1) is fulfilled.\n\n5. Application to bright LMXBs\n5.1. Frequency resolved spectra and nature of the\nvariable component\nThus, observed properties of the luminous LMXBs\n(Sect. 3.3) require a particularly simple form of the spectral variability on time scales from \u223c sec to \u223c msec, described by Eq. (5). The term S0 (E) in Eq. (5) represents\nconstant (non-variable) part of the source spectrum and\nf (t) represents either (i) variations of the normalization\nof the variable spectral component (e.g. Churazov et al.,\n2001) or (ii) small variations of the spectral parameter\n(e.g. Mendez et al., 1997).\nIf variability of the X-ray flux is caused mainly by variations of the normalization, it follows from Eq. (1), that\nthe spectrum of the variable component S(E) is identical\n2\nWith a possible exception of the soft state, e.g. in the soft\nstate of Cyg X-1 (Churazov et al., 2001) found that the shape\nof the power density spectra does not depend on energy and\nthat the spectral variability satisfies the Eq. (5).\n\n\u2202S(E, T0 ))\n\u00d7 \u03b4T (t) + ... =\n\u2202T\n\u03b4T (t)\nE\n\u00d7\n+ ...\n= S0 (E) + S0 (E) \u00d7\nT0\nT0\n\nF (E, t) = S(E, T0 ) +\n\n(8)\n\nTherefore in Eq. (5) S(E) = S0 (E) \u00d7 E/T0 , i.e. is harder\nthan the average spectrum. It is intuitively obvious, however, that in order the linear expansion to be valid, the\nvariations amplitude at any energy should be smaller than\nthe average flux. Indeed, for the quadratic term in Eq. (7)\nto be neglectable, the following condition should be satisfied:\nE\n\u03b4T (t)\n\u00d7\n\u226a1\nT0\nT0\n\n(9)\n\ni.e. (cf. Eq. (8)) the frequency resolved spectrum in any\nfrequency range and at any energy should be small in comparison with the average spectrum of the variable component. Equivalently, fractional rms of flux variations computed with respect to the average flux of the variable component (as opposite to the total average flux) should be\nless than 1.\nIn the first case identification of the variable component would be easy and unambiguous. However, no distinction between the two possibilities outlined above can\nbe made based solely on the results of the frequency resolved analysis, and additional considerations should be\ntaken into account.\n\n5.2. Emission from the boundary layer and accretion\ndisk\nBased on theoretical grounds (Sunyaev & Shakura,\n1986; Kluzniak, 1988; Inogamov & Sunyaev, 1999;\nPopham & Sunyaev, 2001) and observational results\n(e.g. Mitsuda et al., 1984; Mitsuda & Tanaka, 1986;\nGierlinski & Done, 2002) it is expected that in the case\nof accretion onto a slowly rotating weakly magnetized\nneutron star at sufficiently high mass accretion rates\nthere are two major components of the accretion flow:\n1. the optically thick accretion disk extending close to the\nsurface of the neutron star or last marginally stable\norbit\n\n\f8\n\nGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nFig. 9. The average and frequency resolved spectra of GX340+0 (left) and 4U1608\u201352 (right). The GX340+0 data are\nfrom horizontal branch of the color\u2013intensity diagram, i.e. the same as used before. The shaded area shows a plausible\nrange of the boundary layer spectral shape calculated subtracting the predicted disk spectrum from the total spectrum\nand renormalizing the residual to the total energy flux of the frequency resolved spectrum (see Sect. 5.2 and Table 1 for\ndetails). The dashed histogram shows the accretion disk spectrum with parameters from Table 2 (Sect. 5.3), the upper\nsolid histogram shows the difference between the total and accretion disk spectrum (\u2248 boundary layer spectrum). The\nlower solid histogram is the same but scaled to the total energy flux of the frequency resolved spectrum. The lower\npanels show ratio of the frequency resolved spectrum to the lower histogram.\n2. the boundary layer (e.g. Popham & Sunyaev, 2001) or\nspreading layer (Inogamov & Sunyaev, 1999) near the\nsurface of the neutron star. In this layer the accreting\nmatter decelerates to the spin frequency of the star\nand spreads over its surface.\nSimple theoretical arguments, taking into account energy\nreleased in the accretion disk and in the boundary layer,\nand difference in their emitting areas suggest that the\nspectrum of the boundary layer emission should be noticeably harder than that of the optically thick accretion disk (e.g. Mitsuda et al., 1984; Grebenev & Sunyaev,\n2002). Considering the restrictions on the character of\nspectral variability imposed by Eq. (5), it is natural to\nassume, that the observed variations of the X-ray flux\nshould originate in one of these components. Furthermore,\nX-ray variability should be mainly caused by either variations of the total luminosity with nearly constant spectral\nshape or by small variations of the spectral shape. In order\nto distinguish between these possibilities and to identify\nthe nature of the varying component we consider below\ntheoretical expectations for the disk and boundary layer\n\nspectra and compare them with the observed frequency\nresolved spectra.\nDue to complexity of the boundary/spreading layer\nproblem, no models capable to directly predict its emission spectrum exist yet. An attempt of solve the radiation transfer problem using density and temperature profiles obtained in the hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. Popham & Sunyaev, 2001) failed to reproduce, even qualitatively, the observed X-ray spectra and\ndemonstrated importance of the self-consistent treatment\n(Grebenev & Sunyaev, 2002).\nSignificantly better progress has been achieved with\nthe spectra of accretion disks (Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973;\nShimura & Takahara, 1995; Ross & Fabian, 1996). It has\nbeen shown that at sufficiently high mass accretion\nrates the effects of Compton scattering can be approximately accounted for by introducing a dilution factor\nto describe deviation of the spectra emitted at each radius of the disk from blackbody (Shimura & Takahara,\n1995; Ross & Fabian, 1996). Additional modifications of\nthe disk spectrum arise due to gravitational redshift\n\n\fGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nTable 1.

Relatively simple\nmodels of multicolor disk type which account for the\neffects of Compton scattering with a simple color-toeffective temperature ratio turned out to be successful\nin describing the accretion disk spectra observed in the\nhigh state of black hole systems (e.g. Ebisawa et al., 1991;\nGierlinski et al., 1997).\nTherefore we use the predicted disk spectrum as a\nstarting point and subtract it from the total spectrum\nin order to calculate expected spectrum of the boundary\nlayer. To estimate the plausible range of the boundary\nlayer spectra we investigate the parameter space of the\naccretion disk model. This approach enables one to predict the disk and the boundary layer spectra based on\nthe observed X-ray flux and spectrum and very generic\nsystem parameters, such as neutron star spin frequency\nor the source distance. For this analysis we adopt the\ngeneral relativistic accretion disk model by Ebisawa et al.\n(1991) (the \"grad model\" in XSPEC). The parameters of\nthe model are: the source distance D, mass of the central object MNS , disk inclination angle i, the mass accretion rate \u1e40 and the color-to-effective temperature ratio\nf = Tcol /Teff . The source distance was varied in the range\n8.5\u201310.5 kpc (GX340+0) and 3.5-4.5 kpc (4U1608\u201352),\nthe disk inclination \u2013 in the range of cos i = 0.3 \u2212 0.7,\ncolor-to-effective temperature ratio \u2013 in the range 1.6-2.0\n(Shimura & Takahara, 1995).\nIn order to estimate the plausible range of mass\naccretion rates we used the total accretion efficiency\n\u03b7tot and relative energy release fractions of the disk,\nfdisk , and the neutron star surface, fBL , calculated by\nSibgatullin & Sunyaev (2000). These account exactly for\nthe space-time metric around a neutron star with a given\nspin frequency and equation of state. In particular we used\ntheir results for a neutron star with gravitational mass of\n1.4 M\u2299 described by FPS equation of state (their eqs.\n\n9\n\n(1) and (2)). In computing the relation between the observed luminosity and the mass accretion rate we ignored\nthe light bending and abberation effects, the real geometry of the spreading layer and shadow cast by the neutron\nstar on the disk and boundary layer:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03c0\n(10)\nLobs = d(i)fdisk + d( \u2212 i)fBL \u00d7 \u03b7tot \u1e40 c2\n2\nwhere emission diagram is described by Chandrasekhar\u2013\nSobolev law d(i) \u2248 3/7(1 + 2.06 cos i) cos i. The luminosity\nLobs was computed from the absorption corrected fluxes\nextrapolated to 0.1\u201330 keV energy range. The total correction factor from observed 3\u201320 keV flux was \u223c 2 in\nboth cases. Therefore, unless a new spectral component\nappears outside the 3\u201320 keV PCA energy range, the uncertainty of the flux correction should not exceed few tens\nof per cent. The accretion efficiency \u03b7tot and the disk and\nboundary layer fractions fdisk and fBL depend, obviously,\non the neutron star spin, which was varied in the range 0\u2013\n700 Hz assuming that the neutron star and disk co-rotate.\nThe investigated range of the disk parameters is summarized in Table 1. Each predicted disk spectrum was\nsubtracted from the total spectrum and the residual\n(\u2248boundary layer spectrum) was normalized to the observed 3\u201320 keV energy flux of the frequency resolved spectrum. The resulting range of the boundary layer spectra\nfor two sources is shown in Fig. 9 as the shaded area along\nwith the average and frequency resolved spectra of the 25\nHz and kHz QPO and the best fit model described in\nSubsect. 5.3. The lower panels in Fig. 9 show ratio of the\nfrequency resolved spectrum to predicted boundary layer\nspectrum. Different models of the disk emission, e.g. ignoring the relativistic effects (the \"diskpn\" model in XSPEC,\nGierlinski et al. 1997) or model of Ross & Fabian ( 1996)\nwhich more accurately accounts for the Compton scattering effects, but assuming Newtonian dynamics, change\nthe details but do not alter the general conclusion. The\nclose similarity of the expected boundary layer and the\nobserved frequency resolved spectra strongly suggests that\nX-ray variability is caused by variations of the luminosity\nof the boundary layer component. It also implies that the\nspectrum of the boundary layer emission does not change\nsignificantly in the course of these variations (cf. example\ngiven by Eq. (8)).\nOn the other hand it is obvious from Fig. 9 that the\ndisk spectrum is significantly softer and can not reproduce\nthe observed frequency resolved spectrum. Qualitatively,\nthis fact does not rule out the possibility that X-ray variability is due to variations of the disk emission spectrum.\nIndeed, variations of e.g. disk temperature can result in\nthe frequency resolved spectra significantly different (in\nparticular, harder, cf. Eq. (8)) than the average spectrum.\nHowever, as discussed in Sect. 5.1, in order to maintain\nconstancy of the shape of the frequency resolved spectra\nand zero time lags between different energy channels it\nis required, that frequency resolved spectra in any frequency range are \u226a than the average spectrum of the\nvariable component. This condition is obviously violated\n\n\f10\n\nGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nTable 2. Parameters of the spectral modeling\n\nFig. 10. The energy dependence of the fractional rms of\nthe kHz QPO in 4U1608\u201352. Flattening above \u223c 10 keV\nindicates, that the energy spectrum of the oscillations at\nthese energies has the same shape as the total spectrum.\nat E >\n\u223c 10\u221215 keV (Fig. 9 \u2013 cf. the disk and the frequency\nresolved spectra).\nConsidering the quick decline of the disk emission\nabove \u223c 10 keV, another test of the suggested interpretation might be the behavior of the frequency resolved\nspectrum (or fractional rms) at high energy, >\n\u223c 10 \u2212 15\nkeV. Indeed, as at E >\n10\n\u2212\n15\nkeV\nthe\ntotal\nspectrum\nis\n\u223c\ndominated by the boundary layer emission, the fractional\nrms in the above scenario is expected to become independent of the photon energy. Due to insufficient energy\ncoverage this can not be checked in the case of GX340+0\nwhere the disk temperature is rather high. Flattening of\nthe fractional rms is clearly seen in 4U1608\u201352 (lower-most\npanel in Fig. 7 and Fig. 10), having \u223c 10 times lower mass\naccretion rate and correspondingly lower disk temperature\nand softer disk spectrum. Similar behavior was observed\nby Mitsuda et al. (1984) for Sco X-1 using TENMA data.\nThus, we conclude that the bulk of the X-ray variability observed in GX340+0 and 4U1608\u201352 and, presumably, in other luminous LMXBs, on \u223c second \u2013 millisecond\ntime scales is due to variations of the boundary layer luminosity. The shape of the boundary layer emission spectrum\nremains nearly constant in the course of these variations.\nTherefore the energy spectrum of the variable component\n\u2013 the frequency resolved spectrum should be representative, to some accuracy, of the spectrum of the boundary\nlayer emission. This can be used to separate the boundary layer and the accretion disk contribution to the total\nspectrum and permits to check quantitatively the predictions the accretion disk and boundary layer models.

Spectral modeling\nAs small variations of the spectral shape of the boundary\nlayer emission in the course of flux variations can not be\nexcluded and are likely to take place, the frequency resolved spectra represent the boundary layer emission with\na certain accuracy only. This should be kept in mind while\ninterpreting the spectral fitting results described in this\nsubsection. However, the reasonable quality of the spectral\nfits and values of the spectral parameters for two sources\nwith significantly different mass accretion rate provide additional indirect support to the main conclusion of this\nsection.\nBelow we approximate the frequency resolved spectrum (\u2248 spectrum of the boundary layer emission) with a\nplausible model and then fit the total spectrum adding the\naccretion disk component. This procedure is equivalent to\n\n\fGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\n11\n\nsubtracting the renormalized frequency resolved spectrum\nfrom the total spectrum, with the renormalization coefficient determined by requirement to minimize \u03c72 .\nThe simplest models of the blackbody or Wien spectrum with kT \u223c 2 \u2212 2.2 keV, although they reproduce approximately the shape of the frequency resolved\nspectra, show statistically significant deviations from\nthe data (Fig. 11) and give unacceptable value of \u03c72 .\nSignificantly better the spectra can be described by\nthe Comptonized emission models (Sunyaev & Titarchuk,\n1980; Poutanen & Svensson, 1996). Although simple\nComptonization models are not expected to be directly\napplicable to the emission spectra emerging from the\nboundary layer, we give in Table 2 the best fit parameters for comptt model in XSPEC (Titarchuk, 1994) for\neasy comparison with other results. A convenient parameterization of the frequency resolved spectra is provided by\na power law spectrum with exponential cut-off, which we\nwill use for the following analysis of the average spectra.\nAs the second step, we approximate the average spectra by a two component model including the disk, boundary layer emission and the reflected component appearing due to reflection of the latter from the accretion disk:\nphabs\u00d7(grad+pexrav+gaussian). The shape (but not the\nnormalization) of the boundary layer emission was fixed\nat the values determined from approximation of the frequency resolved spectrum. The reflection was modeled using pexrav model (Magdziarz & Zdziarski, 1995) and a\nbroad gaussian line at 6.4\u20136.7 keV. All parameters of the\ngrad model were fixed except the mass accretion rate. The\nmass of the neutron star was fixed at 1.4M\u2299. The disk inclination angle and the color-to-effective temperature ratio were fixed at somewhat arbitrary, although reasonable,\nvalues, which were chosen to approximately minimize the\nresiduals. Note, that presence of the line at E \u223c 6 \u2212 7\nkeV in the average spectrum is statistically significatly\nrequired by the data, especially in the case of 4U1608\u2013\n52. The parameters of the spectral fits are summarized\nin the Table 2. The best fit models and different components are depicted Fig. 9 and 11. Although the \u03c72 values\nof the fits to the average spectra are in the range 3.0\u20134.5\nper d.o.f. and are formally unacceptable, the models describe the observed total spectra (having very statistical\nsignificance, signal/noise\u223c 102 \u2212 103 per energy channel)\nreasonably well, with relative accuracy of <\n\u223c 1 \u2212 2% in the\n3\u201320 keV band.\n\n6. Discussion\nThe best fit values of the mass accretion rates obtained\nfrom the spectral fits agree, within a factor of <\n\u223c 1.7 with\nthe values predicted from the observed energy flux and the\naccretion efficiency expected for a neutron star with spin\nfrequency of \u223c 500 Hz (Eq. (10)). This fact is especially\nencouraging, as the two sources have accretion rates different by a factor of \u223c 10 (Table 2). For such difference in\nthe accretion rate the expected disk temperatures should\ndiffer by a factor for \u223c 1.7 \u2212 1.8, resulting in the different\n\nFig. 11.

See Table 2 for values of the spectral\nparameters.\n\n\f12\n\nGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nshape and total flux of the disk spectra (Fig. 11, lower\npanel). However, after the contribution of the boundary\nlayer is accounted for, the relativistic disk emission model\nis capable of reproducing both spectral shape and normalization.\nDespite large difference in the mass accretion rate in\nthe two sources, the energy spectra of the boundary layer\nemission are very similar to each other. This is in line\nwith the finding that variations of the boundary layer\nluminosity in the broad range of time scales from \u223csec\nto \u223cmsec are not accompanied by significant variations\nof the spectral shape. Similar behavior was found by\nMitsuda et al. (1984) and Mitsuda & Tanaka (1986) on\nlonger time scales of \u223c 103 sec.\nDue to short light travel time of the accretion disk in\nthe vicinity of the neutron star, \u223cmsec, the reflected component, if originating in the inner disk, could contribute to\nthe variable emission and cause deviation of the frequency\nresolved spectra from the true boundary layer spectrum.\nThis can not be directly verified with the present data \u2013\nupper limit on the equivalent width of the 6.4-6.7 keV line\nis in the case of both sources \u2248 110 eV (90% confidence).\nHowever, for the observed shape of the spectrum of the\nboundary layer, contribution of the reflected component\nwith \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u223c 0.2\u22120.3, if any, would not exceed 10% in the\n\u223c 10 \u2212 20 keV energy range, i.e. is comparable or smaller\nthan other uncertainties involved.\nFurther along the Z-track of GX340+0 in the colorintensity diagram, on normal and flaring branches, the\nfractional rms of the X-ray variability decreases significantly, by a factor of \u223c 5 \u2212 10. However, the statistics is\nsufficient to place meaningful constrains on the behavior\nof the frequency resolved spectra at the first half of the\nnormal branch (Fig. 1). The data indicates that the behavior of the frequency resolved spectra does not change\nits character \u2013 at sufficiently high frequency, f >\n\u223c 1 Hz,\ntheir shape does not depend upon the Fourier frequency\nand is significantly harder than the average spectrum and\nexpected spectrum of the accretion disk. Therefore, in the\nsame line of arguments as above, it is representative of the\nspectrum of the boundary layer spectrum. Fit to the frequency resolved spectrum by Comptonization model requires infinitely large values of the Comptonization parameter. Correspondingly, the boundary layer spectrum in\nthe normal branch can be well fit by Wien or blackbody\nspectrum (which are close to each other in the 3-20 keV\nrange) with the best fit temperature of kT \u2248 2.4 keV. As\nevident from Fig. 11 and, especially, from Fig. 12 the high\nenergy part, E>\n\u223c 8 keV of the spectrum of 4U1608\u201352 and\nhorizontal branch of GX340+0 also follows Wien spectrum\nwith temperature in the range kT \u223c 2.1 \u2212 2.3. The composite fit of the total spectrum with the disk + boundary\nlayer spectrum, the same as in Subsect. 5.3, gives a best\nfit value of the mass accretion rate of \u1e40 \u2248 4.6 * 1018 g/s,\ni.e. higher than in the horizontal branch (cf. Table 2). This\nis consistent with the commonly accepted interpretation\nthat the mass accretion rate increases along the Z-track\non the color-intensity diagram.\n\nFig. 12. The absorption corrected frequency resolved\nspectra of QPO (\u2248 boundary layer emission) in GX340 in\nthe horizontal branch, Z=0\u20131 (lower \u1e40 ) and upper half\nof the normal branch, Z=1\u20131.5 (higher \u1e40 ). See Fig. 1 for\nspecification of the regions in the color-intensity diagram.\nThe horizontal branch data is same as in Fig. 4, 9 and 11.\nThe solid line shows Wien spectrum with kT = 2.4 keV.\n\nThe frequency resolved spectra (\u2248boundary layer spectra) on the normal and horizontal branch of the colorintensity diagram are plotted in Fig. 12 along with Wien\nspectrum with kT = 2.4 keV. Combined with the middle\npanel in Fig. 11 this plot shows trend in the dependence\nof the boundary layer spectrum upon the mass accretion\nrate in the range \u1e40 \u223c (0.1\u22121.0)\u1e40Edd. We can tentatively\nconclude that with increase of the mass accretion rate up\nto a value close to critical Eddington rate the boundary\nlayer spectrum in the 3\u201320 keV energy range approaches\na Wien spectrum. Interestingly, at lower values of \u1e40 the\ncharacter of the deviations of the boundary layer spectrum from the Wien spectrum is similar to that expected\nin the situation when Compton scatterings are important\nfactor of the spectral formation in the media with inhomogeneous temperature distribution (Ross & Fabian, 1996).\nIn particular they are qualitatively similar to the numerical results of Grebenev & Sunyaev (2002) on the formation of the spectrum of the boundary layer.\nThe relatively weak dependence of the shape of the\nboundary layer spectrum upon the mass accretion rate\n(Fig. 11 and 12) and the relative constancy of the Wien\ntemperature is somewhat surprising. It implies that in\nthe considered range of \u1e40 >\n\u223c 0.1\u1e40Edd the plasma temperature at Comptonization depth in the boundary layer\nweakly depends upon the mass accretion rate, i.e. increase\n\n\fGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nFig. 13. The power density spectra of GX340+0 in the\n3\u20137 keV energy range (horizontal branch, same data as in\nFig. 4, 9 and 11). The histogram with the error bars show\npower spectra of total, disk and boundary layer emission,\nobtained using the procedure described in the Sect. 6; the\nstraight solid line shows a power law P (f ) = 3.5e \u2212 5 \u00d7\nf \u22121 . The power density is shown in units of fractional rms\nper Hz and all three spectra are normalized to the total\ncount rate in the 3\u20137 keV band. Note, that the lowermost frequency bin is affected by the windowing effects,\nsuppressing the power.\n\nof the \u1e40 does not change significantly vertical temperature structure in the boundary layer.\nThe fact that kHz QPO show the same behavior as\nother components of the aperiodic variability indicates,\nthat they have the same origin, i.e. are caused by the variations of the luminosity of the boundary layer. Although\nthe kHz \"clock\" can be in the disk or due to it's interaction\nwith the neutron star, the actual modulation of the Xray flux occurs on the neutron star surface. Mendez et al.\n(1997) suggested similar interpretation of kHz QPO in\n4U0614+09. In particular they showed, that energy spectrum of the kHz QPO can be approximately described by\na blackbody spectrum with kT \u223c 1.5\u22121.6 keV. Note, however, that they found different energy depedence of continuum aperiodic variability at lower frequencies. That can\npossibly be explained by the fact that the source was in\nsignificantly lower luminosity state, \u1e40 \u223c 10\u22122 \u1e40Edd and\nit's energy spectrum had a distinct power law component\nwhich could dominate variability at lower frequencies.\nThe disk emission is significantly less variable and does\nnot contribute significantly to the variability of the X-ray\nflux at f >\n\u223c 0.5 \u2212 1 Hz. This conclusion is in agreement\nwith results of Churazov et al. (2001) for the high state of\n\n13\n\nCyg X-1, indicating that stability of the X-ray emission\nmight be a common property of the optically thick accretion disk, independently on the nature of the compact object. The origin of the variable component, however, is different in the case of Cyg X-1 (and presumably in the soft\nstate of other black hole binaries). Indeed, the spectrum\nof the variable component in the soft state of Cyg X-1 is\nidentical to the time average spectrum of the hard spectral\ncomponent and is adequatly represented by unsaturated\nComptonization in hot (kTe \u223c 50\u2212100 keV) and optically\nthin (\u03c4T <\n\u223c 1) coronal flow with possible contribution of\nnon-thermal Comptonization. Variable component in luminous LMXBs considered in this paper, if interpreted in\nthe framework of the Comptonization model, requires saturated Comptonizaion (Comptonization parameter y \u223c 1)\nin the relatively low temperature (kTe \u223c 2\u22123 keV) plasma\nand is inconsistent both qualitatively and quantitatively\nwith the corona models usually applied to black hole binaries.\nIn the bright LMXB systems, the contribution of the\ndisk variability becomes noticeable at lower frequencies,\nbelow \u223c 0.5 Hz, where the frequency resolved spectrum\nchanges it's shape and becomes softer (Fig. 4 and 5; cf.\nresults of van der Klis 1986 for GX5\u20131). This can be used\nto estimate the contribution of the disk to the observed\nvariability of the X-ray flux. The result depends on the\ncharacter of the disk variability. In order to make a crude\nestimate we assume that the disk variations also obey a\nsimple linear relation described by Eq. (5):\nF (e, t) = Fdisk (E, t) + FBL (E, t) \u2248\n\n(11)\n\n\u2248 Sdisk (E) \u00d7 fdisk (t) + SBL (E) \u00d7 fBL (t)\nIf disk and boundary layer variations were uncorrelated,\nthe power density of the total signal would be:\nP (E, \u03c9) \u221d Sdisk (E)2 \u00d7 |f\u02c6disk (\u03c9)|2 + SBL (E)2 \u00d7 |f\u02c6BL (\u03c9)|2\nwhere within the accuracy of this consideration one can\nassume that Sdisk (E) and SBL (E) are the disk and boundary layer spectra determined in Sect. 5.3. The functions\n|f\u02c6disk (\u03c9)|2 and |f\u02c6BL (\u03c9)|2 after appropriate renormalization represent power density spectra of the disk and\nboundary layer and can be determined from linear fit to\nthe square of the frequency resolved spectra in each frequency interval. The power density spectra thus computed\nare shown in Fig. 13 along with the total power spectrum\nof GX340+0 in the soft 3\u20137 keV energy band. The power\nspectrum of the accretion disk flux variations is different\nfrom that of the boundary layer, does not extend significantly to the high frequency domain, and is consistent\nwith a power law with slope of \u22121:\nPdisk (f ) \u221d f \u22121\nThe excess power seen at low frequencies, F <\n\u223c 0.5 \u2212 1 Hz\nin the soft energy band (cf.

At higher frequencies\n\n\f14\n\nGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nthe variability is dominated by the boundary layer emission, giving primary contribution to quasi-periodic oscillations and the so called band limited noise compoinent\n(e.g. van der Klis, 1986).\n\n7. Summary\nThe initial observational results are listed in Subsect. 3.3.\nBelow we summarize the constrains on the character of\nthe spectral variability and implications for the boundary\nlayer and accretion disk models.\n\n7.1. Constrains on the pattern and origin of the\nspectral variability in luminous LMXBs\n1. Using RXTE/PCA observations of two luminous\nlow mass X-ray binaries GX340+0 (on the horizontal/normal branch of the color-intensity diagram) and\n4U1608-52 we show that the shape of the Fourier frequency resolved spectra on \u223c second \u2013 millisecond time\nscales does not depend on Fourier frequency (Fig. 4, 5\nand 7). The range of investigated timescales includes\nthe band limited continuum noise, the kHz QPO and\nlower frequency QPOs observed at few tens Hz (Fig. 2,\n3). Combined with the negligibly small phase lags,\n\u22122\n\u2206\u03c6 <\n\u223c 10 (Fig. 6), this restricts significantly the possible pattern of spectral variability of X-ray flux and\nrequires linear relation between flux variations at different energies (Eq. (5)).\nConsidering significant difference in the expected spectra of the accretion disk and boundary layer the observed variations should be associated with either one\nof these two major components of the accretion flow.\nThe X-ray variability is caused either by variations of\nit's luminosity under constant spectral shape, or by\nsmall variations of a spectral parameter (e.g temperature or optical depth) \u2013 Eq. (7).\n2. We compared the Fourier frequency resolved spectra\nwith the expected spectra of the accretion disk and of\nthe boundary layer. The predicted spectra were based\non the observed energy flux/spectrum and very generic\nsystem parameters such as the source distance and\nneutron star spin frequency. The frequency resolved\nspectra are well consistent with the range of the boundary layer spectra expected for plausible range of the\nsystem parameters (Fig. 9, Table 1). On the other\nhand, they are significantly harder than the expected\nspectrum of the accretion disk. It is unlikely that the\nobserved variations are associated with variations of\nthe disk luminosity or spectral shape unless the disk\ntemperature is \u223c 3 \u2212 4 kev, i.e. current accretion disk\nmodels are inapplicable to the neutron star binaries.\n3. The above suggests that the major part of aperiodic and quasiperiodic variability observed in luminous LMXBs above \u223c 0.5 Hz is caused by variations\nof the luminosity of the boundary layer. Its spectral\nshape remains nearly constant in the course of the luminosity variations. This interpretations receives ad-\n\nditional support from the constancy of the fractional\nrms with energy at E >\n\u223c 10 keV, where expected accretion disk emission vanishes, found in case of 4U1608\u201352\n(Fig. 10).\n\n7.2. Implications for the models of the boundary layer\nand disk emission\nThe frequency resolved spectrum is representative of the\nenergy spectrum of the boundary layer emission. This can\nbe used for a more precise decomposition of the spectra of\nluminous LMXBs into accretion disk and boundary layer\ncomponents and for quantitative comparison with predictions of the theoretical models. In the following we shall\nassume that boundary layer spectrum is identical to the\nfrequency resolved spectrum, bearing in mind that this is\ntrue to certain accuracy.\n1. In the considered range of the mass accretion rate\n\u1e40 \u223c (0.1 \u2212 1)\u1e40Edd, the boundary layer spectrum in\nthe 3\u201320 keV energy range depends weakly on \u1e40 . Its\nshape is remarkably similar in GX340+0 and 4U1608\u2013\n52 (Fig. 11), despite the fact that the two sources have\na factor of \u223c 10 difference in the mass accretion rate\n(Table 2).\nIn the limit of high \u1e40 , of the order of \u223c \u1e40Edd (normal branch of GX340+0), the boundary layer spectrum in the 3\u201320 keV energy range can be adequately\nrepresented by the Wien spectrum with temperature\nkT \u2248 2.4 keV (Fig. 12). At lower values of \u1e40 (4U1608\u2013\n52 and horizontal branch of GX340+0) the spectra are\nbetter described by Comptonization model with electron temperature of \u223c 2 \u2212 4 keV and Comptonization\nparameter y \u223c 1 (Table 2). Their high energy part,\nE >\n\u223c 10 keV, is well represented by Wien spectrum\nwith temperature of \u2248 2.1 \u2212 2.3 keV.\n2. The average spectra can be adequately described by\nthe sum of the renormalized frequency resolved spectrum and the accretion disk emission (Fig. 11). The\nspectrum of the latter is well described by the general\nrelativistic accretion disk model. The other parameters, such as source distance and disk inclination angle\nbeing fixed at fudicial but plausible values, the best fit\nvalue of the mass accretion rate coincides, within a factor of <\n\u223c 1.7 with that inferred from the observed X-ray\nflux and accretion efficiency appropriate for a 1.4M\u2299\nneutron star with spin frequency of \u223c 500 Hz (Table\n2). This agreement is especially remarkable, given the\nluminosity and mass accretion rate in the two sources\ndiffer by the factor of \u223c 10.\n3. The accretion disk emission is significantly less variable\nthan the boundary layer emission at Fourier frequencies f >\n\u223c 0.5 \u2212 1 Hz. The power density spectrum of the\ndisk appears to follow a power law Pdisk (f ) \u221d f \u22121 and\ncontributes to the overall variability in the soft energy\nband and in the low frequency domain only (Fig. 13).\n4. The kHz QPOs apear to have the same origin as aperiodic and quasiperiodic variability at lower frequencies.\n\n\fGilfanov et al.: Boundary layer, accretion disk and variability in LMXBs\n\nThe msec flux modulations originate on the surface of\nthe neutron star although the kHz \"clock\" might reside in the disk or be determined by the disk \u2013 neutron\nstar interaction.\n5. Finally we point out that in the case of GX340+0 and\npresumably other Z\u2013sources, the above results apply\nto the normal and horizontal branches of the colorintensity diagram. The source behaviour on the flaring\nbranch, believed to correspond to super-Eddington accretion is more complex and is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nAcknowledgements.
