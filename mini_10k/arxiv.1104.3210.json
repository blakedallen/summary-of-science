This requires\nthe concept of Fuchsian differential equation on Riemann surfaces. We show through\na group theoretic argument that the Heun parameter and a weight constant are\nsufficient to satisfy all monodromy conditions. We then apply the technique of\ndifferential equation on a Riemann surface to the two point function on the torus\nin which one source is arbitrary and the other small. As a byproduct we give in\nterms of quadratures the exact Green function on the square and on the rhombus\nwith opening angle 2\u03c0/6 in the background of the field generated by an arbitrary\ncharge.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiouville theory plays a pivotal role in several fields both at the classical [1, 2, 3, 4] and\nquantum level [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Liouville action provides the Faddeev-Popov determinant in two dimensional gravity [12] and it gives the complete hamiltonian structure of\n2 + 1-dimensional gravity coupled with particles [13]. It appears also in the soliton solutions to the gauged non linear Schroedinger equation on the plane [14, 15, 16]. Liouville\nfield has been suggested to play the role of a fifth dimension in the AdS-CFT treatment\nof QCD [17].\nRecently a renewed interest has developed due to a conjecture [18] that Liouville theory\non a Riemann surface of genus g is related to a certain class of N = 2, 4-dimensional\n\ngauge theories and the conjecture has been supported by extensive tests on genus 0 and\n1 [19, 20, 21] and proven in a class of cases [22].\nIn the topology of the sphere important results regarding the four point conformal correlation functions have been obtained in [23] and their relation to the one point function\non the torus suggested in [23] and proven in [24].\nWe recall that the classical solution provides the starting point for the semiclassical expansion and that such semiclassical expansion was used to confirm the first few terms of\nthe bootstrap solution on the sphere, pseudosphere and disk topologies and also to give\nsome results on higher point functions when one source is weak [25, 26, 27].\nThe simplest situation is given by the topology of the sphere for which many results are\navailable both at the classical and quantum level. The torus topology is intrinsically more\ncomplicated that the sphere. For example the one point function on the torus appears to\nbe of comparable complexity as the four point function on the sphere [23].\nIn a previous paper [28] Liouville theory on the torus was examined in the simpler situation\nin which the distribution of charges is invariant under reflection z \u2192 \u2212z. As the map given\n\nby the Weierstrass function u = \u2118(z) is invariant under reflection it turns out that one\ncan map the problem on the Riemann sphere, where well developed techniques exist along\nwith several results. In the symmetric situation, periodicity, which is the fundamental\nconstraint, is obtained by imposing monodromicity in u. In fact monodromic behavior in u\nat the singular points points ek (see [28] and section 3 of the present paper) combined with\nreflection symmetry is equivalent to the periodicity constraint along the non collapsible\ncycles which in the general case is much more difficult requirement to implement.\nIn [28] the exact solution for the one point function on the square was given and several\nproblems which can be dealt with perturbation technique solved.\nIn the present paper we deal with the problem in full generality i.e. when the distribution\n\n1\n\n\fof charges is not necessarily invariant under reflections; to do this the shall need the full\ndescription of the torus as a double sheet cut-plane and we shall need the notion [29, 30, 31]\nof differential equation on a Riemann surface. As discussed in [28] the differential equation\nwhich solves the Liouville equation in the case of the torus contains even in the simplest\ncase of the one point function a parameter, the Heun parameter which does not appear in\nthe case of the sphere topology with three sources. Such parameter, along with an other\nweight parameter has to be determined by imposing monodromicity on the two sheet cut\nplane or equivalently by imposing the periodic boundary conditions. In the case of the\nsquare and of the rhombus with opening angle 2\u03c0/6 such parameter turns out to be zero\nand the problem is reduced to an hypergeometric equation (see Appendix B); on the other\nhand the exact non perturbative determination of the Heun parameter in the general case\nto our knowledge in not an accomplished task [32, 33, 34, 35].\nThe structure of the paper is the following: In section 2 we display the mathematical\nframework of the formulation of differential equations on a Riemann surface.\nIn section 3 we show with a group theory argument how the Heun parameter along with\nthe weight parameter |\u03ba| give the necessary and sufficient degrees of freedom to satisfy\n\nall the monodromy requirements.\n\nThen in section 4 we solve the problem of the addition of a small charge when the solution\nfor a single (non necessarily small) charge is given, as it is the case of the square and of\nthe rhombus with opening angle 2\u03c0/6. The treatment however is completely general.\nAs a by product we obtain is section 6 the expression by quadratures of the exact Green\nfunction on the background generated by an arbitrary charge. The expression holds also\nfor the general torus; the only difference is that while for the square and the rhombus of\nopening angle 2\u03c0/6 we know the expression of the unperturbed solution, for the generic\ntorus such unperturbed solutions are not known in terms of usual functions.\nIn order to display the workings of the technique discussed in sections 2 and 3, in Appendix\nA we give the perturbative determination of the conformal factor for a weak source in the\ngeneral case i.e. when the source is not symmetric wrt to the position of the kinematical\nsingularities \u03c9k which arise in the transition from the global covering variable to the\ncoordinates (u = \u2118(z), w = \u2118\u2032 (z)) which provide a one-to-one description of the torus.\nIn Appendix B for completeness we report the solution for the square given in [28] and\nwe also add the solution in terms of hypergeometric functions for the rhombus of opening\nangle 2\u03c0/6. The deformation technique developed in [28] can be applied to both of these\ncases.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nDifferential equations on a Riemann surface\n\nWe give here the elements of the theory of differential equations on a Riemann surface.\nFor more details see e.g. [29, 30, 31]. A surface with the topology of the sphere can be\nmapped on the compactified plane where the usual theory of linear differential equations\napply (see e.g. [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]). To extend the concept of differential equation to a\nRiemann surface it is useful to rewrite the second order differential equation\ny \u2032\u2032 (x) + q(x)y(x) = 0\nin the form\n\ndY\ndx + \u0393x dx Y = 0\ndx\n!\ny(x)\nY =\ny (1) (x)\n\ndY + \u0393Y =\nwhere\n\nand\n\u0393x =\n\n0\nq(x)\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n!\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nand we have denoted in eq.(1) by a prime the differentiation wrt x. For well known topological reasons when the manifold has genus 1 or higher we have no global coordinate at\nour disposal and thus we must use more than one chart with analytic transition functions.\nIt is useful to consider y as a differential of the fractionary order \u2212 21 , i.e. in the change\n\nfrom the variable x to the variable x\u0303 we have\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212 21\ndx\n\u1ef9(x\u0303) = y(x(x\u0303))\n\u2261 y(x(x\u0303))s(x\u0303)\ndx\u0303\nwhere\ns(x\u0303) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\ndx\ndx\u0303\n\n\u0013\u2212 12\n\n.\n\nOne easily finds, denoting with a dot the derivative wrt x\u0303\n!\ns(x\u0303) 0\n\u1ef8 (x\u0303) =\nY (x) \u2261 U \u22121 Y (x), U \u2208 SL(2C)\n1\n\u1e61(x\u0303) s(x\u0303)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nand \u1ef8 obeys\nd\u1ef8\ndx\u0303 + \u0393\u0303x\u0303 dx\u0303 \u1ef8 = 0.\ndx\u0303\nThe usual transformation of a connection gives\nd\u1ef8 + \u0393\u0303\u1ef8 =\n\n\u0393\u0303 = U \u22121 dU + U \u22121 \u0393U = \u0393\u0303x\u0303 dx\u0303\n3\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n\fwith\n\u0393\u0303x\u0303 =\nThe term\n\ns\u0308\ns\n\n0\nq\ns4\n\n\u2212\n\ns\u0308\ns\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n!\n\n.\n\nis the Schwarzian derivative of the transformation\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u0013\u22122\n...\n3 \u1e8d\n1x\ndx\u0303\ns\u0308\n= {x, x\u0303} =\n= \u2212{x\u0303, x}\n\u2212\ns\n4 \u1e8b\n2 \u1e8b\ndx\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nIt is of interest to notice that the assumed nature (5) of the solutions y of eq.(1), which\nleaves the Wronskian of two solutions unchanged, makes the well known expression [28]\nfor the conformal factor in terms of two independent solutions of the differential equation\n(1)\ne\u03c6 =\n\n2|w12 |2\n\n[y1 (x)y1 (x) \u2212 y2 (x)y2 (x)]2\n\n(12)\n\na differential of order (1, 1) as required for an area element\ne\u03c6(x) dx \u2227 dx\u0304 = e\u03c6\u0303(x\u0303) dx\u0303 \u2227 dx\u0303 \u0304 .\n\n(13)\n\nOne can extend the concept of Fuchsian differential equation to differential equations on\na Riemann surface provided the term q or better the (2, 1) component of the connection\n\u0393 is a meromorphic function on the Riemann surface i.e. [41] the ratio of two polynomials\nof the same order in the homogeneous coordinates describing the surface.\n\n3\n\nThe torus\n\nThe torus is described by the cubic curve in euclidean coordinates [41]\n(u, w),\n\nw 2 = 4(u \u2212 e1 )(u \u2212 e2 )(u \u2212 e3 ) = 4u3 \u2212 g2 u \u2212 g3\n\n(14)\n\nwith\ne1 + e2 + e3 = 0\n\n(15)\n\nX22 X0 = 4(X1 \u2212 e1 X0 )(X1 \u2212 e2 X0 )(X1 \u2212 e3 X0 ).\n\n(16)\n\nor in homogeneous coordinates\n\nTo the Liouville equation\n\u2212 \u2202z \u2202z\u0304 \u03c6 + e\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03b7\u03b4(z \u2212 zt )\n\n(17)\n\nthere corresponds the differential equation in u given by\ny \u2032\u2032(u) + Q(u, w)y(u) = 0\n4\n\n(18)\n\n\fwith Q(u, w) a meromorphic function on the torus with second order poles at ek due to\nthe presence of the Schwarz derivative in (10) and a second order pole at (u, w) = (t, wt )\n\u0012\n3\n1\n1\n1\n2e1\nQ(u, w) =\n+\n+\n+\n2\n2\n2\n16 (u \u2212 e1 )\n(u \u2212 e2 )\n(u \u2212 e3 )\n(e1 \u2212 e2 )(e3 \u2212 e1 )(u \u2212 e1 )\n\u0013\n2e2\n2e3\n+\n+\n(e2 \u2212 e3 )(e1 \u2212 e2 )(u \u2212 e2 ) (e3 \u2212 e1 )(e2 \u2212 e3 )(u \u2212 e3 )\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b2t (w + wt )\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2 (w + wt )2\n\u2212 u \u2212 2t\n+\n+\n2\n4wt\n4(u \u2212 t)\nw\n2(u \u2212 t)w\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\u03b23\n+\n+\n+\n(19)\n2(u \u2212 e1 ) 2(u \u2212 e2 ) 2(u \u2212 e3 )\nwhere the \u03bb appearing in the residue of the double pole at (u, w) = (t, wt ) is given by\n\u03bb = 1 \u2212 2\u03b7. Due to the factor w + wt the pole is present only on the first sheet. The\n\nterm \u2212u \u2212 2t is necessary to assure that Q does not show an irregular singularity at\ninfinity. The \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 , \u03b2t are the accessory parameters. The above structure can be\n\ntrivially generalized to any finite number of sources. Obviously we could place the source\nat zt = 0 simplifying the structure of Q as was done in [28] but in the perspective of the\ngeneral non symmetric situation (see e.g. section 4) we work here in full generality.\nThe first two lines in the expression of Q is simply the contribution of the Schwarzian\nderivative for the transition from the covering variable z to the variable u. The asymptotic\nbehavior of Q in the local covering variable at infinity v, with v 2 = 1/u is given by\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b21 e1 + \u03b22 e2 + \u03b23 e3 + \u03b2t t +\n(\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b2t )v + v\n+\n2\n16 2\n4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03b2t wt 1 \u2212 \u03bb\n+\n(12t2 \u2212 g2 ) + O(v 6 ).\n(20)\n+v 5\n4\n32wt\nRegularity of\n\u0012\n\ndu\nQv (v) = Q(u, w)\ndv\nat v = 0 i.e. absence of charges at z = 0 implies\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212 {u, v}\n\n\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b2t = 0\n\u03b21 e1 + \u03b22 e2 + \u03b23 e3 + \u03b2t t +\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n=0\n4\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\n\u03b2t wt 1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n+\n(12t2 \u2212 g2 ) = 0\n(24)\n4\n32wt\nand thus at the end we have one free accessory parameter, say \u03b21 which has to be used\nto satisfy the monodromies at (t, wt ) and along the two fundamental non contractible\n5\n\n\fcycles. We want to show at the non perturbative level how one free accessory parameter\nis sufficient for the purpose.\nLet y1 and y2 be two independent solutions of\ny \u2032\u2032 + Q(u, w)y = 0\n\n(25)\n\nof Wronskian w12 . We must find combinations\ny1c = a11 y1 + a12 y2 ,\n\ny2c = a21 y1 + a22 y2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nsuch that\n|y1c |2 \u2212 |y2c |2\n\n(27)\n\nis monodromic. As the Wronskian is fixed the transformation must be of SL(2, C) type,\nwhich corresponds to six real degrees of freedom. In addition we notice that the monodromy of (27) is unchanged under an SU(1, 1) transformation which corresponds to three\nreal degrees of freedom. Thus the ajk provide effectively only three real degrees of freedom\nto which we have to add the real and imaginary part of \u03b21 , i.e. 5 real degrees of freedom.\nWe shall have to satisfy the monodromy condition at all singularities (t, wt ), (ek , 0) and\nalong the two fundamental non contractible cycles C1 and C2 .\nWith regard to the cycle C1 we can use three degrees of freedom (e.g. those given by the\najk ) to obtain\nM12 (C1 ) = M 21 (C1 )\n\nand\n\n|M11 (C1 )| = |M22 (C1 )|\n\n(28)\n\nwhich is sufficient to give the SU(1, 1) nature of the transformation M(C1 ). Finally we\nuse the remaining two real degrees of freedom (the real and imaginary part of \u03b21 ) to\nimpose\nM12 (C2 ) = M 21 (C2 ) .\n\n(29)\n\nThis is not enough to give the SU(1, 1) nature of the transformation M(C2 ). However\nfrom the contour shown in Fig.1, obtained by deforming a loop around zt , the following\nrelation holds\nM(C1 )M(C2 )M(C1 )\u22121 M(C2 )\u22121 = Et\n\n(30)\n\nbeing Et the elliptic transformation around zt . The reason is that the monodromy transformations around each of the singular points z = \u03c9k and z = 0 is simply \u22121, because the\n\nindices at those points are 1/4, 3/4 in u \u2212 ek and \u22123/4, \u22121/4 at u = \u221e and a turn in the\n\nlocal covering variable corresponds to a double turn in u \u2212ek and in u at infinity. Now the\nfollowing simple theorem holds: If in eq.(30) M(C1 ) \u2208 SU(1, 1) and eq.(29) is satisfied\n\nand Et is elliptic, then M(C2 ) \u2208 SU(1, 1) and as a consequence also Et \u2208 SU(1, 1).\n6\n\n\fC1\n\nC2\n\n\u03c93\n\n\u03c92\n\n\u03c91\n\u03c93\n\n\u03c93\n\nzt\n\n\u22121\n\nC2\n\n0\n\n\u03c91\n\nC 1\u22121\n\n\u03c92\n\n\u03c93\n\nFig. 1\nIn fact after eqs.(28,29) are satisfied the matrices M(C1 ) and M(C2 ) take the form\n!\nm11 m12\nM(C1 ) =\n(31)\nm\u030412 m\u030411\nM(C2 ) =\n\n!\n\npei\u03b1 /\u03c1\n\nn12\n\nn\u030412\n\npe\u2212i\u03b1 \u03c1\n\n=\n\nn11 /\u03c1\n\nn12\n\nn\u030412\n\nn\u030411 \u03c1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nThe positive number \u03c1 is fixed by the elliptic nature of the product (30) i.e.\ntr(M(C1 )M(C2 )M(C1 )\u22121 M(C2 )\u22121 ) = R + A\u03c1 + B\u03c12 + \u0100\u03c1\u22121 + B\u0304\u03c1\u22122 = real\n\n(33)\n\nR = (m12 n\u030412 )2 + m11 m\u030411 n11 n\u030411 \u2212 m211 n12 n\u030412 + c.c. = real\n\n(34)\n\nwith\n\nA = (m\u030411 \u2212 m11 )n\u030411 (n\u030412 m12 + n12 m\u030412 ),\n\nB = \u2212m12 m\u030412 n\u0304211 .\n\nEq.(33) has the discrete solution \u03c1 = 1. In general \u03c1 = 1 is not the only solution of\neq.(33). The results of Picard [1, 3] which apply also to topologies other than the sphere,\nassure us that the values of the free parameters which realizes the monodromy are unique\nand thus \u03c1 = 1 is the only solution which realizes all the monodromies. In the next section\nwe shall apply a perturbative version of this theorem to the addition of weak sources.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nAddition of a weak source\n\nIn the present section we shall apply perturbation theory to give in terms of quadratures\nthe two point conformal factor when one source is arbitrary and the second small. A\nsimilar problem was solved in [28] in the simpler situation of the perturbation provided\nby two weak symmetrical sources and which could be treated with methods of the sphere\ntopology. Here instead being the situation non symmetrical we have to exploit in full\nthe two sheet representation of the torus given by the cubic (14). We shall keep the\ntreatment at full generality; we recall that in two instances ( the square, and the rhombus\nof opening angle 2\u03c0/6 as given in Appendix B) the exact solution is known and thus we\nshall for a perturbation of these situations have a solution in terms of quadratures. The\nsame formulas apply starting from the general non perturbative one point function with\nthe difference that in this case the unperturbed functions are given by the solution of the\nHeun equation, at a special value of the Heun parameter for which we do not possess an\nexplicit formula.\nThe equation to be solved is\ny \u2032\u2032 + (Q + q)y = 0\n\n(35)\n\nwhere Q, describing a source of arbitrary strength at the origin z = 0 i.e. u = \u221e, is given\n\nby [28]\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\nu+\u03b2\n(36)\n16 (u \u2212 e1 )(u \u2212 e2 )(u \u2212 e3 )\n\u0012\n3\n1\n1\n1\n2e1\n+\n+\n+\n+\n2\n2\n2\n16 (u \u2212 e1 )\n(u \u2212 e2 )\n(u \u2212 e3 )\n(e1 \u2212 e2 )(e3 \u2212 e1 )(u \u2212 e1 )\n\u0013\n2e3\n2e2\n+\n+\n(e2 \u2212 e3 )(e1 \u2212 e2 )(u \u2212 e2 ) (e3 \u2212 e1 )(e2 \u2212 e3 )(u \u2212 e3 )\n\nQ(u) =\n\nwith the non perturbative Heun parameter \u03b2 fixed to the value which provides the monodromic one point solution on the torus. We know the exact value of such a parameter\nonly for the special cases of the square and the rhombus with opening angle 2\u03c0/6 where\n\u03b2 = 0 for symmetry reasons. We shall denote by y1 (u) and y2 (u) the two unperturbed\nsolutions, with real Wronskian w12 , which realize the monodromic conformal factor\ne\u03c6 du \u2227 d\u016b =\nThe perturbation q is given by\n\n2|w12 |2 du \u2227 d\u016b\n\n[y1 (u)y1 (u) \u2212 y2 (u)y2 (u)]2\n\n.\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b5 (w + wt )2\n1\n\u03b2t (w + wt )\nq(u, w) =\n\u2212 u \u2212 2t\n+\n+\n2\nwt 4(u \u2212 t)\nw\n2(u \u2212 t)w\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\u03b23\n+\n+\n+\n2(u \u2212 e1 ) 2(u \u2212 e2 ) 2(u \u2212 e3 )\n8\n\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\n\fand it describes the additional weak source at (t, wt ). We had to allow in (38) for a new\naccessory parameter \u03b2t at u = t and the \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 are the O(\u03b5) changes of the accessory\nparameters at e1 , e2 , e3 of eq.(36). Again they are subject to two Fuchs relations which\nare imposed by the condition that the behavior of Q + q at u = \u221e remains unchanged,\ni.e. the source at the origin z = 0 (u = \u221e) remains unchanged. They are\n\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b2t = 0\n\n(39)\n\n\u03b21 e1 + \u03b22 e2 + \u03b23 e3 + \u03b2t t + \u03b5 = 0.\n\n(40)\n\nThe analogue of eq.(24) here is absent as now the origin is a singular regular point. Thus\nwe are left with two free accessory parameters, say \u03b2t and \u03b21 . The perturbed solutions\nare given by\ny1c = y1 + \u03b4y1 ,\n\ny2c = y2 + \u03b4y2\n\n(41)\n\nwhere\nI12\nI11\n\u2212 y2\n+ c11 y1 + c12 y2\nw12\nw12\nI22\nI12\n= y1\n\u2212 y2\n+ c21 y1 + c22 y2\nw12\nw12\n\n\u03b4y1 = y1\n\u03b4y2\nwith\nIjk =\n\nZ\n\n(42)\n\nu\n\nq(u, w)yj (u)yk (u)du\n\n(43)\n\nu0\n\nand the O(\u03b5) constants cjk correspond to the addition of the unperturbed solutions and\nthey satisfy c11 +c22 = 0 to leave the Wronskian unchanged. As we have already discussed\nin section 3 if one factors the SU(1, 1) transformations the cjk provide only three real\ndegrees of freedom. We shall first examine the monodromy at the new singularity (t, wt ).\nTaking into account that the integrands of Ijk contain a first and second order pole at\nu = t whose residues are\n\u03b2t yj (t)yk (t) + \u03b5(yj (t)yk (t))\u2032\n\n(44)\n\nwe have that the change of such integrals under a tour around (t, wt ) is\n\u03b4Ijk = 2\u03c0i (\u03b2t yj (t)yk (t) + \u03b5(yj (t)yk (t))\u2032 ) .\n\n(45)\n\nThe monodromy matrix of y1c and y2c at (t, wt ) is given by\nM(t) =\n\n\u03b4I12 (t)\nw12\n\u03b4I22 (t)\nw12\n\n1+\n\n\u2212 \u03b4Iw1112(t)\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03b4I12 (t)\nw12\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\nMonodromy at (t, wt ) requires\nM12 (t) = M 21 (t)\n\ni.e.\n\n1=\n\n9\n\n\u03b2t y12(t) + \u03b5(y12 (t))\u2032\n\u03b2\u0304t y22(t) + \u03b5(y22 (t))\u2032\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\n\fIt is worth noticing that the \u03b2t is fixed independently of all the other parameters. As\nthe transformation at (t, wt ) is elliptic i.e. \u03b5 real, the condition (47) is sufficient to assure\nthat the transformation belongs to SU(1, 1). On the other hand M11 (t) = M 22 (t) can be\nexplicitly proven using the expression of I12 as follows. Eq.(47) tells us that\n0<\n\n\u03b2t y12 (t) + \u03b5(y12(t))\u2032\n\u03b2\u0304t y22 (t) + \u03b5(y22(t))\u2032\n\n=\n\n2\n(\u03b2t y1 (t)y2 (t) + \u03b5(y1(t)y2 (t))\u2032 )2 \u2212 \u03b52 w12\n|\u03b2t y22 (t) + \u03b5(y22(t))\u2032 |2\n\n(48)\n\nwhich, being \u03b5 and w12 real gives\n\u03b2t y1 (t)y2 (t) + \u03b5(y1(t)y2 (t))\u2032 = real\n\n(49)\n\ni.e. M11 (t) = M 22 (t). We add now a remark which will be essential in the following\ndevelopment. If we consider a contour D, see Fig.2, which embraces both the origin\nand the weak singularity at (t, wt ) the resulting monodromy is elliptic. More precisely\nthe product of the perturbation M0c = M0 + \u03b4M0 of the original unperturbed elliptic\ntransformation M0 \u2208 SU(1, 1) at z = 0 and the SU(1, 1) monodromy near the identity at\nz = zt is elliptic. In fact\n\nM0c =\n\nm11 + \u03b4m11 m12 + \u03b4m12\nm\u030412 + \u03b4m21 m\u030411 + \u03b4m22\n\n!\n\n(50)\n\nis still elliptic because the source at the origin is unchanged and ellipticity tells us that\n\u03b4m11 + \u03b4m22 = real and the elliptic SU(1, 1) monodromy M(t) near the identity can be\nwritten as\nM(t) =\n\n1 + ir\n\nb\n\nb\u0304\n\n1 \u2212 ir\n\n!\n\n(51)\n\nwith r = real and \u03b4mjk , r and b all of order O(\u03b5). Their product E has the diagonal\nelements\nE22 = m\u030411 + \u03b4m22 \u2212 ir m\u030411 + bm\u030412\n\nE11 = m11 + \u03b4m11 + irm11 + b\u0304m12 ,\n\n(52)\n\nwith trace real and by continuity, of modulus less than 2. Thus E = M0c M(t) is elliptic.\nWe can now deform the contour D which embraces the origin z = 0 and zt as shown in\nFig.2. Around the singular points (ek , 0) we have\n!\n!\n!\nI11 (ek )\nk)\ny1 + \u03b4y1\n1 + I12w(e\n+\nc\n\u2212\n+\nc\ny\n11\n12\n1\nw12\n12\n\u2248\nI22 (ek )\nI12 (ek )\ny2 + \u03b4y2\n+\nc\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212 c11\ny2\n21\nw12\nw12\n\n(53)\n\n1\n\ndue to the cancellation of the (u \u2212 ek ) 2 contributions given by the integrals Ijk .

Thus we have\n\nM c (C1 )M c (C2 )M c (C1 )\u22121 M c (C2 )\u22121 = \u2212M0c M(t) = elliptic.\n\n(55)\n\nWe can now repeat the argument given in section 3 to conclude that the imposition of the\nc\nc\nSU(1, 1) nature of M c (C1 ) and the relation M12\n(C2 ) = M21\n(C2 ) is sufficient to assure the\n\nSU(1, 1) nature of transformations M c (C2 ). As a consequence E = M0c M(t) \u2208 SU(1, 1)\nand being already M(t) \u2208 SU(1, 1) we have also M0c \u2208 SU(1, 1).\n\n5\n\nDetermination of \u03b21 and ckj\n\nWe come now to the determination of the parameters \u03b21 and cjk .

In this case one has to apply the concept of differential equation on a\nRiemann surface and in particular the concept of Fuchsian differential equation on a\nRiemann surface. As in [28] new accessory parameters appear which have to be fixed by\nimposing the monodromic behavior of the solution. This is a more difficult task than in\nthe symmetric case where sphere topology techniques could be applied. We gave a general\ngroup theoretic argument to prove that the Heun parameter and the weight factor are\nsufficient to satisfy all the monodromies. To give a concrete illustration of the procedure,\nin Appendix A we work out explicitely a perturbative case. Then in section 4 we deal with\nthe problem of the addition of a weak source to the solution of the one point function.\nThe procedure is completely general even if we know the explicit form of the solution only\nin the cases of the square and of the rhombus of opening angle 2\u03c0/6 which are reported\nin Appendix B. This is due to the fact that in these cases for symmetry reasons the Heun\nparameter \u03b2 vanishes. As a byproduct we also obtain the exact expression in terms of\nquadratures of the Green function on the background of one source of arbitrary strength.\nThe results can be used to develop the quantum semiclassical expansion as done for the\npseudosphere, sphere and disk topologies in [26].\n\n14\n\n\fAppendix A\nIn this appendix we summarize the general perturbative treatment of the one point function on the torus when the source is not symmetrical with respect to the kinematical\nsingularities ek and which requires explicitely the two sheet representation of the torus.\nThe general discussion in the non perturbative case was given in section 3; here we give\nthe explicit calculation for the perturbative case.
