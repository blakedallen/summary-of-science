Similar to other natural sciences,\na wealth of knowledge requiring a proper management (especially with regard\nto consistency) and integration has been accumulated in petrology. These tasks\ncould be approached more efficiently, if the knowledge had been machine processable, in particular, if a formal theory of petrology (i.e. a system of axioms,\ndefinitions and theorems [11], p.33) had been available. Ontologies, especially\nOWL ontologies, are well suited for playing the role of a cornerstone of such\ntheory, as they have been remarkably successful in other sciences, e.g., bioinformatics, chemistry, and health care.\nThis paper describes our steps towards developing a formal theory of petrology. We focus on identifying basic terms, providing definitions to other commonly\n\n\f2\n\nused terms i.e., terms used in industrial standards, and namely, rock types such\nas rhyolite or harzburgite, and formalizing the basic set of axioms. We use OWL\nas a main formalization tool enabling us, in particular, to automatically check\nour representation for consistency.\nIt is only natural to start developing a theory by identifying the important\nterms to be later used for representing facts, e.g., knowledge about specific rock\nsamples. Such facts are typically stored in relational databases in modern petrology, so relational databases can be used as a source of terms. We describe the\nconversion of one such database, namely Proba [5] (Sample in Russian), to a\ncollection of OWL ontologies containing facts expressed using an initial set of\ncurrently undefined terms in the 2 section.\nOnce the terms have been identified, we proceed to their formalization, i.e.,\nwriting their definitions in OWL. First, it is essential to define the basic terms,\nwhich can be used to define all other terms. Currently available definitions are\nusually stored in a semi-structured form in natural language thesauri. Besides\nother issues, this often leads to contradictions, especially given differences between schools in petrology. We use one such thesaurus, namely the Glossary\nof Igneous Rocks [7], to define petrological terms and relationships in an OWL\nontology. In addition, we develop a webProtege-based tool to enable domain experts to work collaboratively on term definitions, in particular, to agree upon\nthem. See the 3 section for details.\nFinally, we complement the ontology by using another rich source of term\ndefinitions - internationally adopted scientific recommendations describing rock\nsample classification methodologies, e.g. Igneous Rocks: A Classification and\nGlossary of Terms [10]. The 4 section describes an approach to extracting definitions from the standard and expressing them as OWL axioms. As it stands,\nOWL 2 is insufficient for a complete capture of terms semantics (as specified\nin the standard), but this would be possible if path free linear equations were\nadopted.1 We conclude the paper by summarizing our experience from the described work and outlining plans for the future.\n\n2\n\nFormalizing Facts: From Database to OWL\n\nA considerable amount of important information is saved in databases, but in the\nform of data, which, unfortunately, is not a knowledge and requires an essential\nand laborious processing to obtain knowledge. This section describes a direct\nway of getting knowledge from the data: database conversion to the traditional\nform of knowledge, i.e. knowledge in a natural language. The natural language\nis limited to CNL to make this knowledge machine processable. We follow T.\nKuhn: CNLs are subsets of natural languages that are restricted in a way that\nallows their automatic translation into formal logic. p.5 [9]. We consider CNL as\na universal tool for representing a formal ontological knowledge.\n1\n\nThe\ndetails\nof\nthe\nproposed\nextensions\nare\navailable\nat\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-dr-linear/. Our work on petrology may be\nviewed as a use case for supporting linear equations in future OWL versions.\n\n\f3\n\nThe original database. Proba DB [5] contains data from 1,174 scientific articles (Bibliography table) about 49,285 samples of igneous rocks (Measurements\ntable). Samples are collected all over the globe, which is reflected in the Localities, llocal, lglobal and lgroup tables. The samples are assigned a rock type\n(Rocks table), a genesis type (Errupttypes table), age (ages table), and, which is\nthe main thing, weight percentage (Concentrations table) of chemical substances\nand isotopes (list in the Elements table).\nThis brief description alone already shows that table and column identifiers\ncan only approximately match the terms used by petrologists to exchange sample\ndata. The transition to CNL also solves the problem of converting the data saved\nin RDB to knowledge in a form directly understandable to experts in the subject\ndomain.\nCNL sentences. List 1 includes examples of all types of CNL sentence required\nto present all facts contained in the Proba DB. Local (internal) proper names\nrequired to name various objects within the knowledge base are used in the sentences. So, PUB5633 is the name of article number 5633 (from bibliography.id)\nin the DB. SAM32994 is the name of sample number 32994 (from measurements.id) in the DB, etc. Words are connected by letter \" \" in compound terms.\nThe text also contains well-known global proper names, for example, Iceland,\nAtlantic Ocean.\nList 1. Example of CNL sentences.\nPUB5633 is a publication.\nA title of PUB5633 is \"A CONTRIBUTION TO THE GEOLOGY OF THE K...\".\nSAM32994 is a sample. SAM32994 is a rhyolite.\nPUB5633 describes SAM32994.\nPLC32994 is a place. PLC32994 is a part of Iceland.\nA gathering_place of SAM32994 is PLC32994.\nSUB469812 is a substance. SAM32994 includes SUB469812.\nWPC469812 is a weight_percent. A value of WPC469812 is 73.95.\nA component of WPC469812 is SUB469812.\nThe sentence structure is very simple. A very limited natural language is\nactually required to record all facts contained in a RDB if RDB is normalized.\nBut RDB Proba is normalized not everywhere. Completing normalization is one\nof the tasks of reorganizing a DB to enable automatic conversion to knowledge.\nRules of mapping the RDB content to CNL have been developed. These rules\nare the specification for SQL-scripts dumping RDB to CNL text [15].\nOWL ontology: getting and analysis. All generated sentences are ACE language [3] sentences, and are selected so that a concrete APE compiler 2 could\ncompile them to OWL. A portion of the knowledge contained in each article is\n2\n\nAttempto Parsing Engine http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/tools/\n\n\f4\n\nseparated as a text (ACE file) to be converted to an independent ontology (DL\nspecies is AL(D)). Thus, the DB will be converted to 1,174 ontologies. Columns\nvalues mainly form attribute values, but also class names (rhyolite, harzburgite)\nand individual names (Iceland). Let's consider the ontology obtained for an article with a DB number of 5633. The obtained classes, properties and individuals\nare listed below.\nClasses: place, publication, rhyolite, sample, substance, weight percent.\nObject properties: component, describes, gathering place, includes, mixture, part.\nData properties: authorial number, chemical formula, first page, journal reference,\nlast page, latitude, longitude, reference, title, value, year.\nIndividuails: Atlantic Ocean, Iceland etc.\nAll the terms used except rhyolite refer to contexts outside of petrology and\neven geology. These are the contexts of geography (place, etc), scientific publications (publication etc), solid state physics (sample, substance, weight percent\netc), chemistry (chemical formula). The rest of the report focuses on obtaining\nrock type definitions, including that for rhyolite.\n\n3\n\nFormalizing Terminology: From Natural Language to\nOWL\n\nThe ontology of the facts specifies that the part of names used for classes, relations, individuals belongs to a different ontology (vocabulary). This dictionary\nontology is supposed to provide term definitions, and the author of the article has exactly this understanding in mind. Such scientific terms are normally\nalready collected in a dictionary, for example, Petrographic Dictionary [12], Dictionary of Geological Terms [4], Dictionary of Igneous Rocks Terms [7], Glossary\nof Geology [1]. The dictionary represents a very important and specific type of\nknowledge. It is based on subject domain terms and informal definitions of these\nterms. Example: harzburgite rock type article from [10], p.88:\nHARZBURGITE. An ultramafic plutonic rock composed essentially of\nolivine and orthopyroxene. Now defined modally in the ultramafic rock\nclassification (Fig. 2.9, p.28). (Rosenbusch, 1887, p.269; Harzburg, Harz\nMts, Lower Saxony, Germany; Troeger 732; Johannsen v.4, p.438; Tomkeieff\np.247)\nWe have converted a specific dictionary ([7]) initially presented by authors as\nan html page to an OWL ontology. We begin the formalization of relations between terms (for example, synonymy) and term properties (for example, become\noutdated).\nConverting the dictionary text to ontology. We took the Dictionary of\nTerms of Igneous Rock Types compiled by the Interdepartmental Petrographic\nCommittee in the Department of Earth Sciences of the Russian Academy of\nSciences [7]. The dictionary contains 1,567 articles, the overwhelming majority\n\n\f5\n\nof them being rock names. The dictionary structure and conversion procedures\nrequired to get the ontology are described in [13] and most important below.\nVocabulary: Words are connected by letter \" \" in compound terms.\nArticle title: The dictionary article title contains a Russian term and its English\nequivalent in a simple case, but its both Russian and English synonyms are often\nspecified as well. Each term present in the title generates an ontology class. Thus,\nthe ontology will contain classes in Russian and in English. All terms from one\ntitle are considered synonyms, i.e. their classes are declared equivalent. These\nconversions resulted in 3,179 classes and 1,659 class equivalence axioms having\nappeared in the ontology.\nThe text of the article: The basic dictionary article text parts are: term definition,\ncomment, list of links to references (normally at the end), term origin description\n(normally located on the list of references after the article, in which the term was\nintroduced). Comments and a list of links to references located in some parts\nof the ontology in the form of separate annotations are supposed to be selected\nfrom the text of the article.\nThe dictionary ontology (DL species is ALUF(D)) is published3 and can be\nviewed using any ontology browser at this moment.\nCollective management of scientific term definitions. Another copy of\nthe ontology is accessible by means of webProtege 4 installed on the Geology\nportal5 . The dictionary ontology is 'dic' there.\nIt is important that a prefix and a namespace be assigned to each dictionary.\nWe have for terms of the ontology itself, terms from the Moscow State University\nGeoweb portal, terms from the Petrographic Code of Russia [8], and terms from\nthe [7] dictionary, respectively:\nprefix\nprefix\nprefix\nprefix\n\ndic: <//earth.jscc.ru/ontologies/dic.owl#>\ngwr: <//wiki.web.ru/wiki#>\npgcc: <//www.igem.ru/site/petrokomitet/code#>\npgc: <//www.igem.ru/site/petrokomitet/slovar#>\n\nA formal term meaning definition is critical for developing a formal theory.\nFor example, the current version of the dictionary provides a formal definition\nof the abessedite rock type (see Portlet Axioms for dic:abessedite), and namely\nperidotite and minerals mixture and\ncontains mineral only (olivin or hornblende or phlogopite)\nThis formula is written using the Manchester OWL syntax. It is important\nthat petrologists are able to read it. The process of obtaining a formal (mathematical) definition, especially in a form clear to experts, is described further,\n3\n4\n5\n\nhttp://earth.jscc.ru/ontologies/dic.owl\nhttp://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/WebProtege\nhttp://earth.jscc.ru/webprotege/\n\n\f6\n\nand is one of project's main ultimate goals. The [13] report contains details of\nthe work done.\n\n4\n\nFormalizing Rock Classification\n\nRules of rock type assignment to samples are described in [10] and consist of a\ndescription of initial-classification algorithm and diagrams of final classification\nby percentage of essential minerals. We begin with a specification of all parts\nof the algorithm, sample data being its input and term (word combination)\nrepresenting sample rock type its output. The algorithm is written as a set of\nfunctions in the form of a flowchart clear to petrologists.\nThe algorithm uses some real-valued functions and unary predicates. These\nfunctions and predicates are supposed to have value on any solid [2]. Some of\nthese functions and predicates have been given definitions, definitions should be\nfound for other ones, and some will probably remain without definitions and\nwill enter in the formal theory as primary ones. The algorithm and necessary\ndefinitions are given for ultramafic types of plutonic rock as an example. It\nis shown then how to get formal definitions of some types of rock from the\nalgorithm.\nVPC means mineral Volume Percentage Content of the sample and is also\nknown as \"volume modal data\".\nWe name an algorithm function (for example, ultramafic rock type) receiving sample data at its input and returning a sample rock type name classifying.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Characteristics. We need unary real-valued\nfunctions returning the volume percentage of minerals in a solid. The full set of\nminerals required for the algorithm will be gradually clarified.\nThe following functions of one argument returning a real number were required till now: VPC melilite, VPC kalsilite, VPC leucite, VPC Ol, VPC Opx,\nVPC Cpx, VPC hornblende, VPC garnet, VPC spinel, and VPC biotite. These\nfunctions are primary and may be measured.\nWe also need the VPC of groups of minerals (see [10] p. 4, [6] p. 6): VPC Q,\nVPC A, VPC P, VPC F and VPC M. It is clear that these functions have definitions.\nThe VPC M definition is given below.\nThe following unary predicates will be required to describe the sample:\npyroclastic, kimberlite, lamproite, lamprophyre, charnockite, plutonic,\nand volcanic. All of these predicates are supposed to have definitions. The\ndefinition of pyroclastic is given below.\nDefinitions. All the definitions currently available can be found in a technical\nreport [14]. We show typical examples here. All definitions are based on two\nsources: \"Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms\" [10] and 'BGS\nRock Classification Scheme\" [6], and are confirmed by petrologists.\n\n\f7\n\nVPC Px: the modal content of pyroxenes (required to classify some plutonic\nrocks):\nVPC Px(x) =def VPC Opx(x) + VPC Cpx(x)\nWhere =def means by definition[16].\nVPC OOC and VPC OPH: VPC of mineral groups. We need these definitions to\nformalize the diagrams on Fig. 2.9, p. 28 of [10].\nVPC OOC(x) =def VPC Ol(x) + VPC Opx(x) + VPC Cpx(x)\nVPC OPH(x) =def VPC Ol(x) + VPC Px(x) + VPC hornblende(x)\nVPC M: returns volume percentage of group M (mafic) minerals in the sample (p.\n4, 28 see [10], and especially [6] p. 6). Following the direct instructions given in\n[6] p. 6:\nM = mafic and related minerals, that is all other minerals apart from\nQAPF;...\nwe obtain the definition:\nVPC M(x) =def 100 - (VPC Q(x) + VPC A(x) + VPC P(x) + VPC F(x))\npyroclastic: We mainly rely on the 2.2 PYROCLASTIC ROCKS AND TEPHRA\nsection [10], p. 7.\npyroclastic(x) =def clastic(x) \u2227 (\u2200y clast(y) \u2227 part of(y,x)\n\u2192 volcanic eruption result(y))\nThis can also be represented in DL:\npyroclastic \u2261 clastic \u2293 \u2200(part of \u25e6 id(clast))\u2212 .volcanic eruption result\nAlgorithm. Our algorithm is a further formalization (and elaboration!) of the\nclassification rules provided in the [10]. The algorithm is written as a set of function flowcharts, the main function being the classifying rock type function. This\nfunction should be invoked to classify a sample. We have also created flowcharts\nfor the ultramafic rock classifying function and two diagrams on Fig.2.9 [10], p.\n28: OOC diagram field (the upper triangle) and OPH diagram field (the lower\ntriangle). The IUGS diagram flowcharts are deliberately presented as a chain\nof if-nodes, each one being responsible for one specific diagram area. Each ifcondition represents a system of linear inequalities. The set of such conditions\nhas important mathematical properties:\n\u2013 Any two conditions are incompatible, since areas corresponding to them are\nmutually disjoint\n\u2013 The union of all conditions gives inequalities for a triangle, since conditions\ncover the entire triangle\nIt is important that the described properties can be checked automatically if\ndefinitions are loaded in a reasoner working with linear inequalities.\n\n\f8\n\nRock type predicate definition. The classification algorithm implicitly contains definitions of all types of igneous rock. Definitions can be obtained from\nthe algorithm in the form of formulas one free variable formulas of predicate calculus of first order with numbers. The formula structure shows the complexity\nof the concept behind the term, and also specifies all the concepts underlying\na term. This is extremely important for finding the primary concepts. We have\nquite formally, i.e. using mathematical conversions, obtained formulas for the\nharzburgite and dunite predicates.\nharzburgite: when applied to the sample, the harzburgite predicate should\ngive \"true\" if the sample is harzburgite, and \"false\" otherwise. Flowcharts have\nto be tracked from top to bottom, and conditions leading to a OOC diagram field\nflowchart node producing the \"harzburgite\" value collected, to get a predicate.\nThese conditions should be connected by the logical operation \"and\". The conversions will give the following formula:\nharzburgite(x) = def plutonic(x) \u2227 \u00ac (pyroclastic(x) \u2228 kimberlite(x)\n\u2228 lamproite(x) \u2228 lamprophyre(x) \u2228 charnockite(x))\n\u2227 VPC carbonates(x)\u2264 50 \u2227 VPC melilite(x)\u2264 10 \u2227 VPC M(x) \u2265 90\n\u2227 VPC kalsilite(x)=0 \u2227 VPC leucite(x)=0 \u2227 VPC hornblende(x)=0\n\u2227 0.4*VPC OOC(x)\u2264 VPC Ol(x)\u2264 0.9*VPC OOC(x)\n\u2227 VPC Cpx(x)<0.05*VPC OOC(x)\nThus, a precise definition of the harzburgite igneous rock type consists of three\nparts:\n1. Qualitative characteristics (lines 1, 2).\n2. Absolute restrictions on modal data (lines 3, 4).\n3. Relative restrictions on modal data (lines 5, 6).\nNow we can compare this definition with the informal definition quoted in\nSection 3: the formal definition is more complete. It does not suppose anything\nand does not refer to the diagram. It contains the necessary part of the diagram.\n\n5\n\nLessons Learnt, What is Next?\n\nThis paper describes our experience of converting the petrological information\nstored in databases, glossaries, and classification standards to a formal OWLbased representation. A similar approach, i.e. one based on providing unambiguous and consistent definitions for all terms, can be used in developing a formal\ntheory for virtually any scientific area. We will now briefly summarize the results\nand outline plans for the future.\nFrom data to knowledge. Moving from a database of petrological facts to a knowledge base is beneficial from multiple perspectives. Firstly, the new representation\nis richer and enables generation of sentences in a controlled natural language,\nwhich, in our experience, are understandable to geologists. They can be used\nnot only as an interface to the KB, but also to annotate publications, which\n\n\f9\n\nshould lead to increased amounts of machine-processable metadata. Secondly,\nthe KB (equipped with a CNL-based interface and a SPARQL endpoint) can be\nintegrated with the ontology that provides the vocabulary. This is important for\nensuring a consistent use of the terminology across all information systems using the KB. The stored knowledge can be further integrated with other available\ndatasets, e.g. those provided by the EarthChem consortium. 6\nCentralized vocabulary. Providing a controlled vocabulary is essential for managing the knowledge. In our case, it was most important to collect the terms used\nin the database in a single OWL ontology, and give them unambiguous definitions along with human-readable annotations. This is a substantial improvement\ncompared to the previous situation where terms were defined informally and in\nmultiple, often contradictory sources. The resulting system can be used both as\na dictionary (for people and applications i.e., via SPARQL) and as a tool for\ncollaborative work on terminology.\nRock classification. The formal definitions of the terms captured in standard\nOWL are not detailed enough to support automated rock sample classification,\nwhich is one of the most important use cases in petrology. To this end, we have\ninvestigated the possibility of complementing the definitions with quantitative\nrestrictions on their mineral composition. Such restrictions can be defined using\nlinear equations, a possible extension to the current data ranges in OWL 2.\nSimilarly to databases and glossaries, the classification recommendations,\nnamely [10], are sometimes ambiguous and incomplete as well, so their formalization requires collaboration with petrologists from the Subcommission on the\nSystematics of Igneous Rocks of the International Union of Geological Sciences.\nHowever, we managed to identify some predicates and functions requiring definitions, which can be used as building blocks of a formal theory. Following the\nmethodology described in the 4 section, we have obtained detailed definitions\nfor two types of rock as well as for some auxiliary terms. We plan to extend this\nwork to cover all rock types in the classification.\nOur work enables answering questions like Is a current object a sample of\na certain rock? by performing instance checking, a standard reasoning task in\nOWL. However, this can be extended to query answering to find all possible rock\ntypes for a specific sample or to find all samples of a specific type in the KB.\nThis, however, requires reasoning with linear inequalities, which is not supported\nat large scale at the moment (some reasoners are available, e.g. RACER).\nFinally, we would like to stress that our approach to formalization differs\nfrom what can be seen in many biological and chemical ontologies. They are\noften deep class hierarchies with numerous asserted subsumptions between class\nnames and with relatively few definitions. We focus on providing detailed definitions (using standard OWL and linear equations) instead, and plan to rely on\nautomated reasoners to build and maintain the hierarchy.
