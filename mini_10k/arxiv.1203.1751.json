INTRODUCTION\nWhen a land is available in unknown area for plantation and cultivation, deciding to establish a\ndesirable plantation needs a long term investigation of the desirable parameters of the land and its\nenvironment. An electronic method of area surveillance and monitoring would be helpful for\nsuch tasks. The essential parameters to be sensed for establishing an appropriate plantation unit\nwould be water, wind, temperature and few related items [1, 2]. Water is the main natural\nresource of irrigation system which keeps the plants to grow efficiently and without which no\nplantation unit could be established. The continuous availability of water throughout the period of\nplantation until cultivation has to be ascertained. In order to assess the suitability of the land, long\nterm monitoring such as the period of an year passing through various seasons is needed to be\ngathered. The second system being irrigation system it performs the monitoring operations during\nthe entire plantation period and based on the data collected necessary electronic commands are\nissued to the appliances in the site for watering and pest spraying requirements.\nDOI : 10.5121/ijait.2012. 2102\n\n11\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\n2. REMOTE SENSING OF ESSENTIAL PARAMETERS FOR PLANTATION\nThe remote location for plantation is first identified and appropriate transducers for sensing the\nparameters are installed at chosen points by visiting the site. The transducers are distributed in the\nidentified locations in single or in multiple forms which provide sufficient information for\ndeciding the plants for the area. The transducers generate electrical signals of the concerned\nparameters under consideration and the signals are conditioned as in conventional manner,\ndigitized to produce binary information and conveyed to the computer through wireless unit.\n\n2.1 Parameters to be Sensed\nWater is the primary natural resource for the irrigation system for plantation unit and therefore\nthe availability of water should be assessed first and confirmed. There can be natural water\nreservoirs which would collect water flowing occasionally or continuous flow of water streams\narising from rains or from opening of water beds. If there would be hills nearby and if they hold\nsnow during winter they also supply water in summer to the reservoir due to melting. By\nphysical inspection about the deepness of the reservoir and the capacity of the storage in long\nterm the water level accumulated in the reservoir during different days of the year has to sensed\nand monitored. There are several water level sensors used in practice [3-5]. We use here the\ncapacitive type of transducer where the capacitance changes due to change in dielectric constant\nresulted due to the level of the water. The capacitance is converted into frequency [6] and\nfrequency in turn is converted into voltage by a frequency discriminator and finally voltage is\ndeveloped proportional to water level. During irrigation periods of the plantation unit the\nmoisture contents of the soil has to reach the desired level for improved growth of the plants.\nAlso, assessing the natural moisture contents in the absence of plants would provide information\nabout the selection of plants for that location. A similar capacitive type of pickup to get a voltage\nsignal proportional to moisture content of the soil is used for this purpose.\nThe daily and seasonal variation of ambient temperature is an important factor to be monitored\nthroughout the period of investigation. This would also help in deciding the type of plants for the\nplantation. We use Thermistor type of transducer included in Wheatstone bridge to get a voltage\nsignal proportional to temperature. Appropriate linearization [7] is performed by hardware at the\ntransducer level itself. Natural wind flow within limits helps to make the growth of the plants.\nHeavy wind will have ill effect on the growth of certain type of plants. Therefore the velocity of\nwind flow is another desirable parameter needed to be sensed. In practice, several types of wind\nflow sensors used are of ultrasonic type. As this type of sensor cannot align itself to the direction\nof wind we use miniature windmill [8] to sense the wind flow efficiently. Therefore, despite\nchange in direction the wind flow it produces maximised output. Ambient light available due to\nsolar radiation helps the growth of most plants. This is another desirable parameter to be sensed.\nFor this purpose, standard photo sensor circuit is used as ambient light transducer.\nHumidity of the environment influences the growth of most plants. It represents amount of water\nvapor present in air. Standard humidity sensor, hygrometer, is employed to monitor the humidity\n[9]. Fire detectors may help in assessing how best the area is immune to catching fire with\nplantation of certain type of plants. Standard fire detectors [10] are used in this project and kept at\nselected locations evenly distributed in the field. With this the frequency of catching fire in\nsummer and also in winter can be monitored. For assessing the consistency of the fertility of the\nsoil its pH value is monitored [11] throughout the year during different conditions of climate. As\nmanual inspection of the site is only rarely done, the movements of forest animals over the area\nalso are monitored. Although sensors could be arranged for sensing moving objects for such\nrequirements, it is desirable to capture the video image of the site and transmitted to the remote\n12\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\nlocation. Frozen still images transmitted would help in assessing several other aspects of the site.\nHeavy fire, animals, hunters and group of birds or grasshoppers which would be bothering the\ncrops are easily captured by video and visualized at the remote end.\nIf there is a water stream or water channel connecting the site to outside township or village,\navailability of water flow is sensed by installing standard flow sensors at selected points in the\nstream. If water is available throughout the year the crops cultivated could be transported to\nexternal places through boating service. These are the desirable parameters to be sensed. If\nadditional parameters are needed to be studied they can easily be included in the system for\nsensing and transmission. Appropriate reservations are made in hardware and software for\ninsertion of the extended parameters in future.\n\n2.2 System Design for Remote Sensing and Communication\nThe sensors are located at chosen locations of the area identified for plantation. The signals from\nthe transducers are conveyed to a computer installed in base station setup in the plantation site.\nThe computer in turn arranges to upload the data to website. Once it is uploaded to website it can\nbe monitored in a computer at any remote location and an analysis can be made. In the past,\ndigital control of a model digital factory performed through web [12] was reported. The features\nof the project are suitably modified and adapted to the present application yielding enhancement\nin performance.\nFigure 1 shows simplified schematic of the system monitoring remotely the parameters. In the\nbase station of the plantation site a PC, lab top or notebook is fixed with wireless card attachment\naccessing the server and the internet. Since the transducers are located at different places, use of\ncables connecting to computer may not be feasible. Therefore, modular wireless communicating\nunit such as the popular USB data card is used for computer providing access to internet.\nAll transducers have mini wireless communicators extended to them through which the data are\ncontinuously transmitted to the base station. The data from all wireless transducers are collected\nin the receiver extended to PC and saved in memory as a table which is updating its contents\ncontinuously. The computer being extended to internet the table is updated periodically in the\nwebsite. In the remote PC after giving the user name and password the website is open and the\ntable can be visualized. For use in analysis package, the table is periodically transferred and saved\nin computer hard disc. The power output of the wireless unit employed depends on the range\nbetween the transmitter kept in site and the receiver extended to PC in site.\n\n13\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\nASP\n\nRemote PC\nAnalyzing\nparameters\n\nWeb server\nInternet\n\nVB\n\nPC/\nNotebook\nIn site\n\nWireless\ndata card\nWireless\ndata card\n\nWireless Receiver\n\nTransducer\n\nNote book\n\nTransducer\nTransducer\n\nWeb\nCamera\n\nTransducer\n\nFigure 1.

Video image of web camera is saved in a\nnotebook and directly uploaded to internet through wireless data card. If power supply is not\n14\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\navailable in the site of exploration then modular power supply unit [14] generating electric power\nfrom mini solar panel and mini-windmill could be included in each transducer sensing and\ncommunicating the signal.\n2.2.1 Software Medium and Link to Various Communication Units\nThe link to internet from webmail server is made through Visual Basic. As internet is accessible\nfor the system manager as a client stationed at remote location he can view the table as provided\nby ASP. The server running the VB program gets the data sent from the PC and with the help of\nASP put these data into webpage for accessible to PC at farther end.\n2.2.2 Monitoring the Conveyed Parameters in Remote PC\nThe Plantation website is open at the PC. In order to open it user name and password are needed.\nWhen the website is open a widow displaying the sensed parameters as a table in the screen of the\nmonitor. Table 1 shows its form of appearance wherein various sensors employed are listed and\nthe present data received from source are displayed. Columns 3 and 4 are meant for the tests\nperformed on various transducers at the site. Tests are done periodically as set with the\ntransducers by extending the standby unit to the wireless transmitter during the testing period.\nThe column 3 indicates the time before which the test was performed on the concerned\ntransducer. The status of the test is indicated in column 4. If the test status shows error, then the\nstandby transducer continues to work with the wireless unit.\nThe data in numeric form has relevant units incorporated on them. For instance the temperature\nshowing as 25.5 is representing it in degree Celsius. The pH value between 4 and 7 shows acidity\nwhich is required for most plants.\nThe current data appearing in the table with the test information are saved in reserved memory\nlocations as required for analysis package. From this current data received a set of relevant data\nare extracted and gathered in memory on FIFO basis. If a transducer has shown error status and\nlater the standby transducer replacing this also shows the error status then the transducer needs\nreplacement. Based on the status of the test received manual visits need be made to the site for\nreplacing them with new ones.\nTable 1.

The node known as sink node\nattached with the computer with USB port collects information and transmits to other nodes. This\nnode can be extended to satellite link with the use of appropriate interfaces. In the recent past, by\nlinking the wireless sensor network to a satellite transmission, the data from a set of triangulated\nradars installed for regional exploration has been reported [15]. This approach is now extended to\nthe present application for transferring transducer parameters to remote monitoring PC.\nEight channels are normally extended to the node with USB connection and if more channels are\nneeded to be included they have to be connected in time multiplexed form. In this application of\nremote sensing and communication, as there are ten transducers, they are extended to the node\nwith appropriate multiplexing.\nThe simplified block diagram of the wireless sensor node is shown in Figure 3. A microcontroller\ninstalled is the heart of this node. The microcontroller reads all sensors data and saves them in\nmemory at reserved locations. Through appropriate USART (Universal Synchronous\nAsynchronous Receiver Transmitter) interface the data are transferred to the STX-2 [16] Satellite\nTransmission board. It radiates the signal at 2.4GHz. The satellite network receiver at the other\nend gets these data and puts them in the monitoring PC performing as node in wireless sensor\nnetwork.\n\nSTX-2 Satellite transmission board\n\nUSART-interface\n\nMicrocontroller with all sensors linked\n\nFigure 3. Simplified block diagram of satellite\nbased wireless sensor node\n16\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\n2.3.1 Comparison of Wireless Sensor Network and Internet for Transmitting\nTransducer data\nThe wireless sensor network is being used for different applications without access to satellite\nlink. Each node can transmit and receive information as to satisfy the environmental\nrequirements. The processing of information is done at the sink node linked to a computer. It has\nhowever restricted radio range.\nIn this project as the remote monitoring PC is situated at a far place, the help of satellite link was\nnecessitated in transferring the transducer parameters. The hardware involvement in using the\ninternet communication and the satellite link are more or less the same. The cost involvement in\nusing internet and satellite link has to be explored depending upon the involvement of number of\nchannels. The time delay of information reaching the PC is not a critical issue in this application\nand therefore the performances of both mediums are well acceptable.\n\n3. DIGITAL IRRIGATION SYSTEM\nIn the remote sensing and transmitting system described above the parameters sensed at one place\nare monitored in computer in a remote location and there is no control activity involved in it. The\nobjective of that implementation was to explore the possible agricultural parameters of the land\nfor its suitability of establishing an appropriate plantation unit. This is therefore a simplex system\ntransmitting data in one direction from the site to remote PC.\nThe remote control system employed in digital irrigation system is duplex system where sensed\nparameters flow in one direction and control signals flow in the opposite direction. This scheme is\napplied to a remotely located irrigation system where the plantation already exists. We use partly\nthe facilities available in the simplex remote sensing system and incorporate remote control\nactivities so as to fulfil the requirements of establishing duplex system. Therefore, we observe in\na computer the sensed parameters arising from the irrigation site transferred through internet.\nAfter making an analysis of the sensed parameters control commands are issued through the same\ninternet as to switch ON or OFF selected appliances in the irrigation system.\nRegular routine works such as opening and closing the valves at a predetermined periodicity are\nperformed on the site. The control signals arriving from remote PC overruns this activity as to\nkeep the irrigation efficiently.\n\n3.1 Parameters Sensed for Irrigation\nAs the main objective of irrigation system is to maintain required moisture contents in the soil for\nentire duration of cropping, the determination of the moisture contents becomes essential\nparameter for this task.

The essential parameters sensed by transducers at various locations are transmitted to the\ncomputer at irrigation location and then uploaded in the website, all done similar to the previous\nsimplex remote sensing unit.

Remote control of digital irrigation system\n\nAs described before, there are two water pumps included in the system. The deep well pump is\nused to pump the underground water from rigged well to the overhead tank supplying water for\nirrigation. Natural water reservoir like lake is another source supplying water to the overhead\ntank. In order for the irrigation to perform smoothly the water level in the overhead tank should\nbe maintained at specified level. The water from overhead tank or pumped water from reservoir\ncan be connected to the feeder pipe by performing electronic control.\nWhen the water level of the reservoir is good enough then that the pump connecting reservoir to\nfeed water grid sprayer (FWGS) is preferred to be switched ON first. If it is not enough then the\ndeep well pump of rigged well is operated to fill the overhead tank. The overhead tank has\n18\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\nrequired head to feed the FWGS. Decisions are made to switch ON a particular pump depending\nupon the moisture contents, water levels and past history of the switching made on the pumps.\nThe FWGS can supply overhead tank or pumped water from reservoir as executed from remote\nPC as well. As a consequence of command received from PC the PIC issues signals to operate\nthe control valves installed with the feed water sprayer. The electrical current from PIC is\nconverted into pneumatic pressure actuating the respective control valve. The pest drug solution\ncan be mixed with water and sprayed to the plants. Pest spraying is performed at required\nperiodicity.\nWhen the website is open in the remote PC two windows can be seen in the screen. The first\nwindow is like a table shown in Table 1 informing the status of the transducer parameters\nincluded in the system. The second window is meant for issuing control action and it appears as\nshown in Table 2. Only two pumps are included in the system for control and the table shows\ntheir present status. Also the present status of irrigation feed whether connected to overhead tank\nor cut OFF is also indicated. There is another column marked as control column which can be\nchanged by the manager at the remote PC. For instance, in the table the present status of deep\nwell is shown as OFF and the control also is shown as OFF. After making an analysis and\ndecision if the deep well pump has to be switched ON the manager just types 'ON' in this field.\nThis issues necessary command in the PIC at the site to switch ON the deep well pump. In the\ncase of switching the standby transducer, the user clicks the present status/transducer and uses the\n\u2193 key to see the status of transducers one by one. For instance, overhead tank water sensor needs\nthe standby to be connected then he selects that sensor and also selects the connect-standby\noption to send this command to the PIC at the other end.\nTable 2.

If a command exists then it formulates the appropriate bytes and sends them to the\nPC at the irrigation spot for issuing necessary control actions to PIC for switching on/off of the\npumps, control valves or the standby transducer.\n\n19\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\n3.2.1\n\nMicrocontroller-PIC Hardware Control\n\nThe PIC microcontroller connects the water tap daily to the feed tubes going to all plants for a\nprefixed time as set in the program. The time period is changed by the remote PC after making\nthe analysis of moisture contents of the soil, temperature, water levels in the reservoir and the\noverhead tank and the ambient light. Therefore, in the PIC monitoring program it checks for the\ncommands issued from the server in response to remote Manager PC. Therefore, while\nperforming the regular daily routines it also actuates the commands issued from the remote PC.\nThe main control actions arising from remote end are switching ON or OFF the two pumps and\nthe irrigation feed tube.\nCircuit diagram to switch ON or OFF the appliances such as pump is shown in Figure 5. The PIC\nprocessor issues just one bit (high) as to switch ON or (low) OFF the motor-pump as to pump the\nwater accordingly. The opto-coupler provides necessary isolation for transients and EM\ninterferences.\n\nFigure 5. PIC circuit for controlling a relay\n\n4. SYSTEM ANALYSIS\nA performance analysis about the remote sensing and control activities performed in digital\nirrigation unit is made and presented here. Also performed is the financial analysis of the\nirrigation system producing cumulative cash flow.\n4.1 Financial Analysis with Computation of Expenditure Involved\nIn order to assess the financial involvement and benefits of the remote control employed for\nirrigation two methods of analysis are performed. The performance of the remote control\ntechniques over the manual operations are assessed based on the available data and presented.\nThe comparison is made between the manually controlled irrigation and digitally controlled\n20\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\nirrigation. Even in manual control method, transducers are employed to get the information about\nthe soil and others.\nThe initial investment is almost same for the digital irrigation and the manual control used for\nirrigation. Period of growing and cultivation of crops is different for different kinds of plants.\nAlthough some kinds of plants yield production shortly within a month, most plants need a period\nof three months to six months. Therefore we presume the growing and cultivation period of six\nmonths for the present digital irrigation scheme performed by remote control. Figure 6 shows the\nfinancial involvement of both schemes for a period of 6 months. The expenditure shown is the\nnormalized expenditure made for the area of coverage of the plantation of 10 hectares. Although\nthe initial expenditure involved in both the schemes are almost same the digital irrigation yields\nless running expenses compared to manual controlled irrigation.\nIrrigation with manual control\n\n1\nNormalized\nExpenditure\n\nDigital irrigation with remote control\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFirst cultivation period (months)\nFigure 6. Financial involvement during first cultivation period\n\n4.2 Analysis of Irrigation Digital Irrigation with modified Retscreen software\nThe Retscreen analysis is a financial analysis software which can produce the cumulative cash\nflow of the renewable energy system when the required data are given as input to the software\n[17, 18]. We now emulate the Retscreen software with suitable modifications made to it such that\nthe financial analysis of digital irrigation system involving remote sensing and control. Figure 7\nshows the tasks performed by modified Retscreen analysis software package.\nTo the settings of the package inputs are given describing the project type and technology\ninvolvement and also the climate factors influencing essentially the soil conditions, moisture and\nwind flow. The settings and environment are applied to irrigation model already installed in the\npackage. The model covers various activities involved in the remote control of digital irrigation.\nThe input of the model are financial involvements involved and the initial cost spent for the\ntransducers, local communicating units, ground station PC and the initial cost spent for irrigation\nunit posted in internet. The outcome of the irrigation model are given to the financial analysis\npackage which in turn produces the annual savings compared to the manual control scheme\nemployed for irrigation and the cumulative cash flow.\n21\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\nThe cumulative cash flow for the possible life span of 10 years is produced by the modified\nRetscreen software and shown in Figure 8. It shows that the amount invested for the digital\nirrigation can be recovered in first 2 years and after which it yields profit to reach nearly 7 times\nthat of the investment in remaining 8 years.\nClimate Factors\nData\n\nFinance input\nInitial Cost\n\nIrrigation\nModel\n\nSettings\n\nProject Type\nTechnology\nInvolvement\n\nYield in\nProduction\n\nAnnual\nSavings\n\nFinancial\nAnalysis\n\nCumulative\nCash Flow\n\nFigure 7.

Security concerns,\ntestability, maintainability, limitations and extendibility are the major factors to be analyzed as a\nmeans of assessing the performance of the systems.\n4.3.1. Security Concerns\nBy giving user name and password the website in the remote Manager PC cab is open at any\ntime. As soon as the website is open one can see the status window and control window. As the\nwebsite demands user name and password it ensures security and no unauthorized person could\nissue wrong control. By making the password issue a complex concern the security aspects could\nbe strengthened.\n22\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\n4.3.2. Testability\nThe system issues test signals and their test status are indicated. Furthermore, as to ensure the\naccuracy semi automatic testing is performed by visiting the plantation site and checking the\nparameters with various sensors and the magnitudes of signals can be verified in the website. Test\nsignals at different levels are inserted and watched in the website for their changes and also the\ntime constant involved are tested. The time constant depends on the communication path between\nthe source and the destination and the bit rate of transmission. The status of sensors and control\nappliances are checked with other available communication mediums as well. By these cross\nchecks of the data reliability of the remote sensing system and remote control schemes are\nascertained.\n4.3.3 Maintainability\nMalfunctioning of any of the devices can provide wrong information about the parameters and the\nanalysis package might produce an error. This is avoided by properly maintaining the devices in\nworking conditions. Each transducer is backed up with a standby unit and a local simple testing\nprocess is carried periodically as to switch ON the standby unit as active transducer and test the\noutput of both of them. If the outputs do not tally, the error signal is communicated along with the\ntransducer signal to the website for taking corrective measures at the other end. The transducers\nemployed are fool proof ones that it provides self generated error output, if any.\n4.3.4 Limitations\nThe sporadic interruptions occurring randomly in the internet such as disturbances in the server\nlevel or in the communication network influence the remote data acquisition system.\nNevertheless, as the decision is not taken instantly such disturbances do not have any impact on\nthe system performance.\n4.3.5 Extendibility and inclusion of several other parameters\nThis system has no limitations in extending additional parameters and control appliances needed\nfor different environment in digital plantation or digital irrigation system. When hardware\nappliances are brought under remote control it needs revision in the software also. This is only a\nminor task and could easily be performed.\n\n5. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION\nThe system performs the remote sensing and remote control activities without the manual\nobservation and attention in the site. Being an automatic system unavailing manpower and\nproviding information for long period like a year it is highly preferred in several instants as to\ndecide the type of the plantation unit in the identified remote site. A watch span of one year\nundergoes all seasons encountered and provides sufficient information for the judgement.\nAs internet usage has become a common means of sharing and exchanging information between\nusers its usage for implementing remote control of a digital irrigation system simplifies its\ncommunication process without calling for special communication systems. On the other hand\ninternet is still growing sector with more and more incorporation of additional strategies and\noverheads and this act would certainly enhance the features of internet based remote sensing and\nremote control systems.\nIn place of the single channel wireless data transmitter installed at each transducer for\ntransmitting information to PC at the base station, one can think to use wireless sensor node and\n23\n\n\fInternational Journal of Advanced Information Technology (IJAIT) Vol. 2, No.1, February 2012\n\nnetwork. In this case it has the advantages of reliability ensured by the wireless sensor network.\nOn the other hand this activity uses only a part of facilities available in the wireless sensor node\nand utility part would be low.\nOnly few control actions are included in the irrigation system reported. It would be easily\npossible to extend further with as many control actions as needed for the plantation site. The\nsystem accepts the desired number of sensors and control channels with appropriate changes\nmade in hardware unit and software package.\nThe video channel conveyed to the remote PC provides information about the accidents, fire\nhazards, movement of animals and many other things. Selected frames of images can be frozen\nand saved in memory for future analysis purposes.\nThe remote control techniques employed here help maintaining the irrigation system which is far\naway from the control place. The water resources are economically utilized after testing the\nconditions of the soil. If needed, alarms can be arranged to appear in the remote station monitor\ndrawing the attention of the manager when any error occurs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the Rector of European University of Lefke for providing\nfinancial support for this project.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\nBaransel Saygi, Yakup Yildirim, Cengiz Cabuko, Hasan Kara, Saime Sezgin Ramadan and Tan\u0131l\nEsemenl, \"The effect of dehydration and irrigation on the healing of Achilles tendon: an experimental\nstudy\", Turkish Journal of Trauma & Emergency Surgery, 2008, Vol 14, No 2, pp 103-109.\n[2] Pete Melby, Simplified Irrigation Design, John Wiley and Sons, NewYork, 2010.\n[3] S.Rangan, G.R.Sarma and V.S.V.Mani, Instrumentation Devices and Systems, Tata McGraw Hill,\nNewDelhi, 2003.\n[4] K.Balasubramanian, \"Microprocessor based process control system\", J.
