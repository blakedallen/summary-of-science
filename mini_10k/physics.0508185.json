Zilbergleyt\nSystem Dynamics Research Foundation\nlivent@ameritech.net\nThe principle of Le Chatelier is one of the best-known fundamentals of chemical equilibrium.\nBeing originally set up by its author qualitatively [1], it defines the direction where to the\nchemical system will move to accommodate a thermodynamic mismatch, resulted from changes\nof the system conditions: the stressed equilibrium system makes a dodge to another equilibrium\nstate, where the stress is minimal. This is the simplest known example of self-organization in\nNature. Le Chatelier principle is an extension of the Gauss' principle of least constraints [2,3]\ninto chemical processes.\nSince the time when the principle was initially worded, it is common to say that Le Chatelier 's\nprinciple is easier to illustrate than to state [4]. Well-known examples, used to explain how the\nprinciple works, are related to temperature or pressure changes. H. Le Chatelier [5] and R.\nEtienne [6] tried to move the principle towards the use of numbers, by offering simultaneously a\nmoderation theorem for mole fractions in the form of an inequality. At about the same time, T. De\nDonder developed moderation theorems for thermodynamic affinity and basic thermodynamic\nparameters of state [7]. According to I. Prigogine and R. Defay [8], the moderation theorem for\naffinity \u03b4A(d\u03be/dt)p,T>0 was the most general and correct thermodynamic formulation of Le\nChatelier's principle. Indeed, it takes into account both key factors \u2013 thermodynamic affinity A as\na general force and the reaction extent \u03be, depending on the change.\nUnfortunately, those efforts didn't turn Le Chatelier principle into a quantitative tool; likewise\nwith Gauss' principle, it is still being employed exclusively for verbal explanations. Formulation\nof Le Chatelier's principle in a form of precise dependencies will be certainly of great help in\nchemical equilibrium analysis.\nWe will use the term \"Le Chatelier's response\" (or its abbreviation \u2013 LCR) to define the chemical\nsystem action elicited by an internal or external impact, the impact that creates constraints and\nforces the system to leave the existing equilibrium state for another one. Also, it makes sense to\ndistinguish between disappearing, or \"soluble\" (soft) constraints, and persisting, or \"insoluble\"\n(harsh) constraints, that are put on the chemical system. The soluble constraints result in\ntemporary stresses; they disappear traceless as soon as reaction attains new equilibrium state.\nThat may correspond, e.g. to a one-time change in temperature, pressure or mole fractions. In\nisolated system, such a kind of changes in many cases may merely mean a system switch to a\ndifferent section of the reacting space, defined by new chemical variables and relevant\nthermodynamic parameters.\nThe insoluble constraints do not disappear with the system adjustment to new equilibrium until\nthe shifting force is ceased by an external hand. Insoluble constraints lead to minimal, but nonzero residual stresses at new equilibrium state. For instance, that kind of constraints occurs when\nthe activity coefficients are changed; or in a system with two or more competing conjugated\nchemical reactions. It is noteworthy that the problem of soluble constraints is applicable to\nchemical reaction regardless the reacting system where it runs, even if nowhere (like in more than\na century long tradition of classical chemical thermodynamics), while treatment of insoluble\nconstraints strictly demands system approach.\nThe LCR mostly falls into a shift-force relationship. Our previous experience revealed a nearly\nuniversal shape of this dependence regardless the origin of thermodynamic force \u2013 usually it is\nrelatively steep ascending curve with saturation (Fig.1, curve 1 on the left picture and dispersed\npoints on the right picture; the right part is from [9]; all cases correspond to insoluble constraints).\n\n\f2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n1\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03a6\n\n0\n\n15\n\n4\n\n8\n\n\u03a6\n\n12\n\nFig.1.

The results\nare presented in Table 1 with the following notations: \u03b7 \u2212 thermodynamic equivalent of\ntransformation of reaction C+H2=CH4 (in this case - the equilibrium amount of CH4); \u2206\u03be (or just\n\u2206) \u2212 reaction extent (equals to unity at the base equilibrium); \u03b4\u03be (or just \u03b4) \u2212 reaction shift from\nthermodynamic equilibrium (equals to zero at the base). The negative value of \u2206G/\u2206\u03be is the\nthermodynamic affinity, in this case a driving thermodynamic force between two equilibrium\n\n\f3\nstates. In this example the base temperature was 973.15K. The system at any other temperature\nwas considered perturbed with regard to the base and subject to LCR commensurate with the\nextent of deviation from the base. Two values in Table 1 were calculated by formulas (see [10]):\n\u2206 = \u03b7/0.193, where 0.193 is the base \u03b7 value, \u03b4 = 1\u2212\u2206. In our definition, \u2206 indicates system\nproximity to thermodynamic equilibrium, in this case to the base, taking its highest value of unity\nat that point. This data is turned into a graph in Fig.1, left, curve 2. To move the starting point of\nthe curve to zero, the reference frame was shifted towards negative values of \u2206G by 16.280\nkJ/mol. All LCR graphs in Fig.1 apparently are similar.\nAn attempt to find analytical relations between the shift and the shifting force was done in [10]\nwith regards to an open chemical system under insoluble constraints and with only one chemical\nreaction allowed to run. To account for possible complexity in the shift-force formula, we define\nfor LCR the term \u03c1j as a function of the reaction shift from thermodynamic equilibrium, \u03b4j\n(1)\n\u03c1j = f (\u03b4j),\nand corresponding LCR-force equation as\n(2)\n\u03c1j = \u2212 (1/\u03b1) Fj ,\nwhere the perturbing force Fj has the dimension of energy gradient at a dimensionless reaction\nextent; \u03c1j is dimensionless; \u03b1 has the same dimension as the force. Following the derivation\nprocedure from [10], we will receive at constant p and T a new equation for the reduced by RT\nchange of Gibbs' free energy of the system at chemical equilibrium under constraint as\n(3)\nln[\u03a0j (\u03b7j,0)/\u03a0j (\u03b7j,\u03b4j)] \u2212 \u03c4j\u03c6(\u03b4j) = 0,\nwhere \u03b4j=1\u2212\u2206j and \u2206j is reaction extent, \u03a0j(\u03b7j,\u03b4j) is a regular mole fractions product in chemical\nequilibrium. Quite obviously at \u03b4j=0 we have the equilibrium constant Keq=\u03a0j(\u03b7j,0), and \u03c4j\u03c6(\u03b4j) is\na non-classical term, defining the constraint. The factor \u03c4j is the chaotic temperature, the ratio of\nthe product of coefficient \u03b1 by corresponding Onsager coefficient (see [10] for details) and RT.\nThe \u03c4j is a parameter, identical to the growth factor in the theory of bio-populations [11]; behavior\nof the open chemical system strongly depends on that value. Chemical equilibrium, described by\nequation (3) corresponds to a certain shifting force; it can be found dividing any term of this\nequation by the reaction extent \u2206j.\nTo find \u03c6 ( \u03b4j), we write the response down as a sum of various powers of the reaction shift\n(4)\n\u03c1j = \u03a3\u03bdj\u03b4jn,\nwhere \u03b4j<=1, and the series power n may or may not start with zero and may or may not tend to\ninfinity. The powers of \u03b4j in formula (4) may have different, but so far unknown weights \u03bdj; we\nwill equate them to unity. With this remark, contents of the n-series define the value of the second\nterm as follows:\n- if n = {0, ..., \u2192 \u221e) we have \u03c1j =1/\u2206j, and \u03c6(\u03b4j) = 1;\n- if n = {1, ..., \u2192\u221e) we have \u03c1j =\u03b4j/\u2206j, and \u03c6( \u03b4j) = \u03b4j;\n- if the \u03b4jn \u2212 sum starts with n=1 and its upper limit is restricted to relatively small n\nvalues, we have \u03c1j = \u03b4j+\u03b4j2+...+\u03b4jn, and \u03c6(\u03b4j) = \u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4jn);\n- in a particular case, if the sum contains only term with n=1, \u03c1j = \u03b4j, and we have \u03c6(\u03b4j) =\n\u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4j).\nWhen the stressed system shifts to new equilibrium state, in case of soluble constraints the second\nterm of equation (3) vanishes due to \u03b4j=0, otherwise taking the minimal possible value. The case\nof \u03c6(\u03b4j) =1 doesn't satisfy any of the equations, and should be eliminated from consideration. The\nlast of the above listed cases leads to the logistic equation for Gibbs' free energy change in an\nopen system as\n(5)\nln[\u03a0j(\u03b7j,0)/\u03a0j(\u03b7j,\u03b4j)] \u2212 \u03c4j\u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4j) =0.\n\n\f4\nGraphical solutions to equation (5), known as bifurcation diagrams, depict evolution of chemical\nequilibrium, driven sequentially through the areas of true and open equilibrium up to bifurcations\nand chaos when \u03c4j increases [10].\nWe do not know any reported occurrence of bifurcations (or anything worse) when the perturbed\nchemical system under soluble constraints gains new equilibrium state. So, the best option for the\nsoluble constraints is\n(6)\nln[\u03a0j(\u03b7j,0)/\u03a0j(\u03b7j,\u03b4j)] \u2212 \u03c4j\u03b4j =0.\nTaking into account that one cannot find the \u03c4j value from the experiment (including direct\ncomputer simulation experiment), we have compared appropriate curves for both shapes of the\nsecond term, obtained by computer experiment, and data for a soluble constraint on the\nC+H2=CH4 reaction from Table 1 (Fig.2). We would like to focus the reader's attention on 2\nfeatures of the curves in Fig.2. First, solution curves to both equations (5) and (6) very well match\neach other prior to bifurcation point. Second, the curve 3 for a soluble constraint actually follows\nthe same pattern, and its fit in two previous curves is just a matter of scaling.

Solution diagrams for equations (6)\n(curves 1, 2, 3) and (5) (curve 4).\n\nabsence of bifurcations in case of equation (6) gives curve 4 in Fig.3, obtained by iteration\ntechnique. Curves 1, 2, 3 in Fig.3 originated from equation (5) with \u03c1j = \u03a3 \u03b4jn and \u03c6(\u03b4j)=\u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4jn),\nwhere initially n=1 and the limit values of n were 1, 2, and 3. Interesting enough that due to \u03b4j<1,\nthe contribution of the \u03b4jn member declines as n increases, and eventually (1\u2212 \u03b4jn) tends to unity.\nThe curves keep the same shape for \u03c4j\u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4jn) with well expressed degradation in the bifurcation\ndiagrams toward the simple ascending curve 4 of Fig.3.\nThe delay area on the abscissa, corresponding to the area of thermodynamic equilibrium\nconverges into point when the curves in Fig.3 are transformed into shift-force coordinates.\nOur observation prompts us to assume that equation (6) may well describe what happens to the\nchemical system under a soluble constraint. It looks as if the more complicated expression for \u03c1j\ngives simpler results and vise versa. Consideration of possible internal degrees of freedom of the\nchemical system may provide some kind of an explanation for this result. Indeed, bifurcations\noccur at the point where the thermodynamic branch gets unstable; in a common language, this is a\npoint where the external impact against the system, which forces it to decrease the reaction\nextent, becomes an intolerable burden. Higher powers of \u03b4jn in LCR indicate more complicated\ninternal organization with more internal degrees of freedom, and more flexible resilience to\nexternal impact; such a system may be less prone to splitting its states. Then, at n\u2192\u221e we get a\n\n\f5\nlimit like curve 4 in Fig.4 corresponding to rather \"soft\" impact like a change of temperature,\nwhile a stronger external impact may suppress the degrees of freedom at higher powers of n,\nbringing \u03c6(\u03b4j) down to \u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4jn) with limited n value and even to \u03b4j(1\u2212 \u03b4j) \u2013 as in the case we\ninvestigated in [10] and in some other previous publications.\nTo conclude, one should mention that in many applications logistic equations are used to create a\nrough picture of a system behavior with bifurcations and to allow for verbal explanations. In our\nprevious works (see [10]) we set as an objective to create the system domain of states using\nlogistic equations to analyze chemical systems with more possible precision. Numerical\npresentation of Le Chatelier's principle was a key idea to success in the thermodynamics of\nchemical systems, unifying the equilibrium and non-equilibrium branches on a unique basis in the\ntreatment of chemical equilibrium.\nAs always, the author is grateful to his very convincing editor, Dr. Nolte from the\nEditAvenue.com.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n\nH.
