We compute the static contribution to the free energy with QMC, and obtain the phonon\ncontribution from density functional theory, yielding a high-accuracy calibration up to 900 GPa usable directly\nin experiment. Furthermore, we compute the anharmonic Raman frequency shift with QMC as a function of\npressure and temperature, allowing optical pressure calibration in table-top experiments.

This all-electron methodology is generally applicable to first-row solids, and can be\nused to provide a new reference for ab initio calculations of solids and to benchmark pseudopotential accuracy.\nPACS numbers: 64.30.Jk,81.05.Je,02.70.Ss,63.20.dk\n\nAlthough the number of studies of materials using density\nfunctional theory (DFT) continues to grow explosively, the\naccuracy of their predictions is variable, sometimes excellent\nand sometimes poor, limiting the confidence one may place\nin DFT results as a quantitative calibration for experimental studies. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), particularly diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), is the highest-accuracy method\nfor finding the ground state of a many-electron Hamiltonian.\nFor solids with atoms heavier than He, however, the Hamiltonian itself is approximated using pseudopotentials (PPs) based\non a lower-accuracy theory, limiting its reliability, and as we\nshow, commonly used PPs give disparate results. In this Letter, we push the state of the art in accuracy by introducing a\nmethod for an all-electron DMC simulation of solids, eliminating the bias from pseudopotentials, and apply it to create a\nhigh-accuracy pressure calibration scale.\nThe combination of ultra-high pressure mineralogy with\nseismology has yielded a wealth of insight into the internal\nstructure of our planet. Pressure is the key that links these\ndisciplines, mapping phase transitions and mineral properties\nto planetary depth. Establishing an absolute pressure calibration at multi-megabar pressures, however, poses a fundamental and continuing problem for high-pressure experiment.\nCurrent primary calibrations are based on data from shockwave experiments, which infer pressure from conservation of\nmomentum and energy as the shock traverses the sample. Experimental uncertainty, combined with errors in model extrapolation, yield scales which differ from each other by as much\nto 7% at room temperature, with even greater discrepancies at\nhigh temperature[1]. Such disparity remains a serious obstacle to a quantitative understanding of Earth's interior.\nA pressure calibrant is a material with a known equation of\nstate (EOS), a small sample of which may be included in hydrostatic equilibrium with the test subject (e.g. ruby[2]). As\nan alternative to shock experiments, high-pressure Brillouin\nscattering, which provides a measurement of the bulk mod-\n\nulus, in conjunction with X-ray diffraction measurements of\nvolume, can be integrated to provide an EOS, but a correction must be made to transfer from an adiabatic to an isothermal path[3]. New approaches such as quasi-adiabatic Z-pinch\nbased experiments[4, 5] also hold future promise for a primary scale. There have been attempts to refine the ruby\nscale[6], and new calibrations have also been suggested[3].\nCubic boron nitride(c-BN) has been identified as a promising\nmaterial for a new scale[7]. In this Letter, we provide a new\npressure scale based on DMC calculations of the EOS and Raman frequency of c-BN. This theoretical approach has the advantage that, in contrast to present experimental approaches,\nthe method works equally well under high compression, and\nuncertainty does not grow with pressure.\nPressure is the negative volume derivative of the Helmholtz\nfree energy. In a wide-gap insulator such as c-BN, the free\nenergy can be written as a sum of the frozen lattice enthalpy,\ndependent only on volume, and a phonon thermal free energy,\nwhich depends on both volume and temperature. Since the\nstatic enthalpy is the dominant contribution at ordinary temperatures, errors in a theoretical EOS can most often be attributed to the static part. Previous calculations of the EOS\nof c-BN have been based on DFT[7], which use approximate\nfunctionals to treat electron exchange and correlation. Several\nfunctionals are in common use, each giving rise to a different\nEOS, and there is no a priori way to predict which will give\nthe most reliable result.\nQuantum Monte Carlo simulation methods explicitly treat\nelectron exchange and correlation instead of resorting to approximate functionals. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) computes properties by a Metropolis sampling of a trial wave function. Diffusion Monte Carlo samples the many-body ground\nstate of the Hamiltonian through a stochastic projection of\nthe trial function. In practice, a fixed node approximation is\nused for fermions, such as electrons, which tests have shown\ngive relatively small error when the nodes are obtained from\n\n\f2\nhigh-quality DFT orbitals for electronically simple materials\nsuch as c-BN. DMC for solids has been demonstrated to give\nsignificantly more accurate cohesive energies[8], equations\nof state and Raman frequencies[9], and phase transitions[10]\nthan DFT. We have used both the CASINO QMC software\nsuite[11] and QMCPACK[12].\nQMC simulations of solids are currently performed within\nthe pseudopotential (PP) approximation, in which the core\nelectrons are eliminated and their effect replaced by a nonlocal potential operator[8]. Since PPs are presently constructed\nwith a lower-accuracy theory, such as Hartree-Fock (HF) or\nDFT, this replacement represents an uncontrolled approximation. To eliminate this error, we develop a method for allelectron (AE) QMC simulations of solids in QMCPACK using\ntrial wave functions derived from full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) calculations using the EXCITING code[13]. Space is divided into spherical muffin\ntin regions around the nuclei, and an interstitial region. Orbitals are represented inside the muffin tins as a product of radial functions and spherical harmonics, and outside as planewaves. To ensure that a wavefunction satisfies the variational\nprinciple, it must be both continuous and smooth. We utilize a\nsuper-LAPW formalism that enforces continuity and smoothness at the muffin tin boundary. For efficiency, we represent\nthe orbitals as 3D B-splines in the interstices and the product\nof radial splines and spherical harmonics in the muffin tins.\nSince AE QMC simulations are computationally expensive, we perform these simulations in 8-atom cubic supercells.\nSimulation cells this small would typically have significant\nfinite-size errors. We eliminate these errors by combining data\nfrom AE simulations with that from PP simulations performed\nin both 8-atom and 64-atom supercells. Thus, we are able to\nsimultaneously eliminate systematic errors from pseudpotentials and from finite-size effects. The corrected static-lattice\nenergy is given at each volume as\n\u0003\n\u0002\nkinetic\nPP\n,\nE = E64\n+ E8AE \u2212 E8PP + \u2206MPC\n64 + \u220664\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the term in brackets removes the psuedopotential\nand \u2206kinetic\nare, respectively, potential[14] and\nbias. \u2206MPC\n64\n64\nkinetic[15] corrections for finite-size errors. We perform\nthis procedure with three different PP sets commonly used\nin QMC: HF PPs from Trail and Needs (TN)[16, 17]; HF\nPPs from Burkatzki, Filippi, and Dolg (BFD)[18]; and DFTGGA[19] PPs generated with OPIUM (WC)[20]. Performing the same procedure with 128-atom PP simulations and\n16-atom AE simulations yields statistically indistinguishable\nresults, demonstrating that finite-size errors are converged at\nthis size. Additional methodological details and the finite-size\ndata can be found in EPAPS document No. #.\nTo compute the phonon free energy, we use density\nfunctional perturbation theory (DFPT) in the QUANTUM\nESPRESSO package[21] with the Wu-Cohen functional and\nthe OPIUM PPs. The phonon density of states, from which\nwe derive thermodynamic data, is usually very well-described\nwith DFT.\n\n(a) Parameters for 300K EOS\nSource\nPP/AE atoms\nTrail-Needs PP + AE\n64/8\nOPIUM GGA PP + AE\n64/8\nBFD HF PP + AE\n64/8\nBFD HF PP + AE\n128/16\nDatchi et al.[24]\nGoncharov et al.\n\n3\n\nV0 (\u00c5 ) B0 (GPa) B0\u2032 (nondim.)\n11.792(18) 381(6)\n3.87(6)\n11.769(17) 385(6)\n3.86(6)\n11.781(20) 382(7)\n3.87(7)\n11.812(8) 378(3)\n3.87(3)\n11.8124\n395(2)\n3.62(5)\n11.817(32) 387(4)\n3.06(15)\n\n(b) Parameters for thermal pressure\n\u22123n\n\nn=\nn=\nn=\nn=\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n0 (K \u00c5\n\u03b8n\n)\n4.836656\u00d7103\n-6.929704\u00d7101\n4.634278\u00d710\u22121\n-1.273468\u00d710\u22123\n\n\u22123n\n\n\u03b1n (K\u22121 \u00c5\n)\n2.598608\u00d710\u22123\n-1.200504\u00d710\u22124\n2.789128\u00d710\u22126\n-2.008994\u00d710\u22128\n\n\u22123n\n\n\u03b2n (K \u00c5\n)\n-4.869563 \u00d7103\n1.763443 \u00d7102\n-2.186053 \u00d7100\n9.303181 \u00d710\u22123\n\n(c) Parameters for Raman calibration\nc0 (cm\u22121 ) c1 (cm\u22121 ) c2 (K)\nb\nR0 (GPa) R1 (GPa) R2 (GPa)\n1055.9\n-144.24 1497.8 3.0155 349.87\n1849.4\n112.33\n\nTABLE I: Parameters for the c-BN EOS and Raman calibration.\n\nWe compute the free energy for our c-BN system at twelve\nunit-cell volumes, spanning volume compression ratios from\n0.84 to 2.0, corresponding to pressures of about -50 GPa to\n900 GPa. While it is not fully certain that the cubic phase of\nBN is stable to 900 GPa, no other structure has been observed,\nand theoretical studies have not identified any transitions below 1 TPa[22]. We use the Vinet form[23] for the isothermal EOS, which we find represents our free-energy data very\nwell, yielding the bulk modulus, B0 , its pressure derivative,\nB0\u2032 , and the equilibirum volume, V0 (Table I(a)). The statistical error bars for each data point are directly determined from\nour QMC data. We compute statistical confidence ranges, taking into account parameter cross-correlations with a simple\nMonte Carlo procedure.\nFigure 1 shows the EOS of c-BN at 300 K, with experimental data from Datchi et al.[24] and Goncharov et al.[7], as\nwell as the present work from simulations with three different\nPPs. The residuals in (c) are derived from DMC simulation\nwith PPs alone, while those in (b) combine all-electron and\nPP data. There is significant discrepancy between the theoretical curves in (c), suggesting that PP simulation alone does\nnot provide sufficient accuracy. Once the PP data is combined\nwith AE data, as in (b), all the theoretical curves come into\ngood agreement. Our theoretical EOS agrees reasonably with\nthat in Refs. [24] and [7] within the experimentally measured\npressure range, but the experimental extrapolation shows significant deviation at high pressure.\nWe may write the thermal equation of state in the form\nP (V, T ) = P300K (V ) + Pth (V, T ) \u2212 Pth (V, T = 300), (2)\nwhere P300K is the room-temperature contribution, fit to the\nVinet form.

We compute the pressure and temperature dependence of this frequency. Within the quasiharmonic\napproximation, phonon frequencies have explicit dependence\non volume only. At constant pressure, however, these frequencies have an implicit temperature dependence resulting from\nthermal expansion. The dependence due to thermal expansion accounts for only about half the total T -dependence of\nthe Raman mode, as observed in [25] and [26]. The remaining T -dependence can be attributed to significant anharmonic\neffects in c-BN, and is included in our calculations.\nSince the optical branch has small dispersion, we treat the\nanharmonicity as a one-dimensional on-site anharmonic oscillator, in a similar approach to the QMC computation of the TO\nRaman frequency of diamond[9]. At each volume, we compute the effective Born-Oppenheimer potential well for the\nTO mode with DMC and the BFD PP at nine displacements\nalong the mode eigenvector in the 64-atom supercell. We fit\nthe data to a quartic polynomial, and numerically solve the 1D\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation in this analytic potential. This results in\na set of single-phonon energy levels, {En }, with nonuniform\nseparation. From {En }, we compute an intensity-weighted\naverage Raman frequency, \u03bd\u0304, as a function of pressure and\n\nh\u03bdi =\n\nEn \u2212En\u22121\nn=1 In\nP\u221e hc\nn=1 In\n\nP\u221e\n\n, where In = n e\n\n\u2212 kEnT\nB\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThe excess thermal softening, i.e. beyond that from thermal\nexpansion alone, is accounted for by the thermal average of\nthe anharmonic frequencies. Figure 2 shows the computed\nRaman frequencies compared with the experimental data reported in Refs. [25\u201327].\nBoth Refs. [25] and [26] give a ruby-like calibration formula, which can be expressed as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP = (R/b) (\u03bd/\u03bd\u0304)b \u2212 1 ,\n(8)\nwhere R, \u03bd\u0304, and b have quadratic T -dependence. This dependence is sufficient below 2000 K, but cannot represent our\ndata at high temperature. We use a form which captures the\nBoltzmann occupation of phonon excitations,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bd2 (P )\n(9)\n\u03bd(P, T ) = \u03bd0 (P ) + \u03bd1 (P ) exp \u2212\nT\n\u0014\n\u00151/b\nbP\n\u03bdn (P ) = cn\n+ 1 , n = 1, 2, 3\n(10)\nRn\n\nwith parameters in Table I(c) and plotted in Figure 2(a). Note\nthat this formula cannot be analytically inverted, but a very\nsimple iterative solution can be used for calibrating pressure\nfrom \u03bd and T .\nThe main axis of Figure 2(b) gives the room-temperature\nRaman frequency versus pressure. There is good agreement\nin the relatively low-pressure region in which the Raman frequency was measured. At very high pressure, the deviation\nwith respect to the extrapolation in [25] increases with a maximum discrepancy of 38 cm\u22121 or, conversely, a deviation in\n\n\f4\nand can be used to cross-calibrate scales based on other materials. Since the accuracy of our methods should not depend\non compression, our calibration can be used up to 900 GPa.\n\n(a) Fit to present theory for Raman shift.\n\nThis work was supported under the National Science Foundation Grant EAR-0530282.

(a) gives compares our theoretical Raman frequency\nwith the fitted form in Eqs. 9 and 10. (b) compares our calibration\nat 300K with the experimental results from [25] and [26]. The black\ndots with error bars are the QMC frequencies, while the blue solid\nline gives the fit. The lower inset gives an expanded view at low\npressure, in which the shaded region gives the statistical confidence\nregion. The upper inset gives the variation with temperature.\n\nthe pressure calibration of 50 GPa at 900 GPa. The deviations with respect to [26] are 70 cm\u22121 and 120 GPa. The\nexperimental parameters capture the correct qualitative highpressure behavior up to 900 GPa, despite the fact that data was\navailable only to 20 and 64 GPa, respectively. This suggests\nthe form for the fit was well-chosen.\nWe have presented a fully ab initio pressure calibration\nbased on quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and have introduced a method for all-electron simulations of solids to eliminate bias from pseudopotentials. This method should be applicable to at least first-row solids, allowing increased accuracy\nin the study of other materials and providing a new benchmark\nfor other methods. The only remaining systematic error in the\nstatic contribution to the EOS is from the fixed-node approximation used in DMC. For simple materials such as c-BN this\nerror should be quite small, and tends to cancel between different volumes. Thus we believe the EOS is robust enough to\nbe used directly in experiment as a primary pressure calibrant,\n\nElectronic address: esler@uiuc.edu\n[1] Yingwei Fei et al., PNAS 104, 9182 (2007).\n[2] H.K.
