These data were obtained under excellent seeing conditions at the\nESO VLT and NTT telescopes. We determine the mean red clump star\nmagnitudes in the J and K bands in the four galaxies. A comparison of the\nextinction-corrected K-band red clump star magnitudes with the tip of the red\ngiant branch magnitude, the mean RR Lyrae star V-band magnitude, and the\nmean K-band magnitude of Cepheid variables at a period of 10 days (for the\nLMC and SMC) strongly suggest that the red clump star absolute K-band\nmagnitude has a very low (if any) dependence on metallicity over the broad\nrange of metallicities covered by our target galaxies.

Our findings\nimply that present-day population corrections calculated from models are only\naccurate at a +/- 0.15 mag level, which is a great achievement in itself but not\naccurate enough for high-precision distance scale work.\nWe determine the distances to all our target galaxies from the K-band red\nclump magnitude, with very small statistical uncertainties.

This should eventually lead to a\nclear picture about the true capabilities of the different methods, and their dependence on\nenvironmental properties like metallicity and age, and will help us to select, calibrate and\napply those techniques which give the most accurate results. A more detailed description of\nthe Araucaria project can be found in Gieren et al. (2001).\nThe helium-burning intermediate-age red clump stars are particulary interesting and\nimportant in our studies. The main advantage in using these stars as standard candles is\ntheir small range of observed brightnesses, in any given photometric band, and the fact\nthat they are very numerous in the solar neighborhood. About of one thousand red clump\nstars have trigonometric parallaxes measured by the Hipparcos satellite with an accuracy of\nbetter than 10 %, which made it possible to calibrate this method with an unprecedented\naccuracy (Paczy\u0144ski and Stanek 1998, Alves 2000).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe main concern about using any object as a distance indicator is related to possible\npopulation effects which might affect its brightness in different environments. Observations\nof red clump stars in clusters in the Magellanic Clouds indicate that the dependence of the\nmean I-band magnitude on age is practically negligible (within \u00b1 0.05 mag) for the age\nrange 2-9 Gyr (Udalski 1998). Detailed studies of the dependence of < I >RC on metallicity\nwere performed using a large set of nearby red clump stars with spectroscopic metallicity\ndeterminations obtained by Mc Williams (1990). Within the range of metallicities covered\nby the nearby red clump stars (-0.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.1) the slope of the brightness-metallicity\nrelation in the I band turned out to be a small, but non-negligible 0.14 mag/dex (Udalski\n2000a).\nImportant progress was made by Alves (2000) who calibrated the absolute magnitudes\nof a large sample of Hipparcos-observed nearby red clump stars. An outstanding and\nobvious advantage of using the K band is that it practically eliminates any dependence of\nthe obtained results on the adopted reddening. Alves (2000) also showed that the K-band\nmagnitude of red clump stars does not seem to depend, in any significant way, on metallicity\nin the range from -0.5 to 0.0 dex. The results of the very recent work of Grocholski and\nSarajedini (2002) also suggest that the mean magnitude of red clump stars in the K band\nmay be an excellent standard candle, and therefore the step of taking the method to the\nnear-infrared wavelengths is of a profound importance.\nEncouraged by these first results we decided to perform deep near-infrared imaging of\nselected fields in four Local Group galaxies, the LMC, SMC, and the Carina and Fornax\ndwarf spheroidals, in order to study in more detail how the mean K and J absolute\nmagnitudes of red clump stars depend on their metallicities and/or ages. The very broad\nrange of these environmental properties covered by our target galaxies was expected to be\nvery useful for this purpose. In this paper, we are reporting on the results of this study.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Calibrations\n\nThe data presented in this paper were collected with the ESO/VLT telescope equipped\nwith the ISAAC infrared camera. In our chosen setup, the field of view was about 2.5 \u00d7\n2.5 arcmin with a scale of 0.148 arcsec/pixel. The observations were performed on two\nphotometric nights ( 9 and 10 November 2001). The seeing was about 0.5 and 1 arcsec\nduring the first and second night, respectively. The J and Ks observations for two fields in\nFornax, and two fields in Carina were secured on the first night. In addition, Ks images\nwere obtained for a third field in the Carina galaxy in this first night of excellent seeing.\nDuring the second night, J and Ks imaging was performed for two new fields in Carina, and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntwo additional fields in Fornax. We also obtained J-band data for the third field in Carina,\nobserved in Ks on the first night. Table 1 gives information about the coordinates of our\nchosen fields, and the number of red clump stars found in each of them.\nIn order to account for the frequent sky level variations in the infrared domain,\nespecially in the K band, the observations were performed with a jittering technique. In\nthe Ks filter, we did 5 consecutive 12 s integrations (DITs) in any given sky position before\nmoving the telescope by about 20 arcsec to a different position. 24 and 78 such jittering\npositions obtained for the Carina and Fornax galaxies resulted in a total net exposure time\nof 24, and 78 minutes, respectively. The observations in the J band were made in a similar\nfashion. The total net exposure times for Fornax and Carina in this filter were 480 s and\n240 s during the first night, and 800 and 360 s during the second night.\nIn order to accurately transform our data to the standard system, we secured 8 and 6\nobservations of standard stars from the UKIRT system ( Hawarden et al. 2001), on the first\nand second night, respectively, at a variety of airmasses. These standard stars were chosen\nto span a broad range in colors bracketing the colors of the red clump stars in our fields.\nAperture photometry of the standard stars was performed with the DAOPHOT program\nusing apertures with radii of 16 pixels. Transformations coefficients were derived for each\nnight. The accuracy of the zero points was calculated to be about 0.025 mag.\nThe data reductions were performed in an exactly analogous manner as in Pietrzy\u0144ski\nand Gieren (2002). In brief, the sky was subtracted from the images using a two-step\nprocess implying the masking of stars with the xdimsum IRAF package. After flatfielding\nand stacking into final images the PSF photometry was performed with the DAOPHOT\nand ALLSTAR programs, following the procedure described in detail in Pietrzy\u0144ski, Gieren\nand Udalski (2002). Aperture corrections were derived using about 10-20 relatively bright\nand isolated stars, after iteratively removing all stars from their neighborhood. The final\naperture corrections were adopted as the median taken from all measurements and typically\nhad a rms scatter of about 0.015 mag.\nA more detailed description of the observations, data reduction and calibration\nprocedures together with a discussion of the morphology of near-infrared color-magnitude\ndiagrams will be presented in Pietrzy\u0144ski, Gieren and Udalski (2003, in preparation).\nAs part of the same project, we observed 10 different fields in the LMC and SMC on 3\nnights with the ESO NTT telescope in the J and Ks filters. We have already used a part\nof these data to derive the distance to the LMC using K-band photometry of red clump\nstars (Pietrzy\u0144ski and Gieren, 2002). The detailed description of the complete set of data\ncollected for the Magellanic Clouds will be presented in a separate paper (Pietrzy\u0144ski,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nTable 1.

Here we use photometry obtained with the ESO\nNTT on 2 nights for 3 fields in the LMC and 2 fields in the SMC, to study the magnitudes\nof red clump stars in these galaxies. Basic information on the data is given in Table 1.\nObservations, reductions and calibrations of these Magellanic Cloud data were performed\nin the same manner as for the data obtained for the Fornax and Carina dwarf galaxies. The\naccuracy of the derived zero points for the 2 NTT observing nights was better than 0.03\nmag. It is worthwhile noticing that the instrumental systems at both the NTT and VLT\ntelescopes are identical, which obviously helped us to obtain very homogenous data, for all\nfour galaxies discussed in this paper.\n\n3.\n\nMean K- and J-band red clump magnitudes\n\nThe near-infrared K vs J-K color-magnitude diagrams around the red clump region\nare shown in Fig. 1 for our four target galaxies. The relatively large number of red clump\nstars found in our 4 fields in Fornax (see Table 1) allowed us to derive their mean K-band\nmagnitudes individually for each field in this galaxy. We did this by selecting the stars with\nK-band magnitudes in the range from 18.3 to 20.3 mag, and J-K colors in the range from\n0.3 to 0.85 mag and deriving the histogram of their K-band magnituds in bins of 0.06 mag\nfor each field. Then function (1), which consists of a Gaussian component representing the\nred clump stars distribution and a second order polynomial function approximating the\nstellar background was fitted to the data, following a procedure originally introduced by\nPaczy\u0144ski and Stanek (1998):\n\nn(K) = a + b(K \u2212 K\n\nmax\n\n) + c(K \u2212 K\n\nNRC\n(K \u2212 K max )2\n\u221a exp \u2212\n) +\n2\n2\u03c3RC\n\u03c3RC 2\u03c0\n\nmax 2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nThe same procedure was applied for deriving the mean red clump star magnitudes\nin the J band. The results are presented in Table 2. It can be appreciated that the four\nindependent measurements of the mean J- and K-band red clump magnitudes obtained on\nthe two different observing nights are in very good agreement. We therefore decided to\nmerge the data in order to improve the statistics. The fits of function (1) to the histograms\nof the K and J magnitudes of red clump stars from the combined data are displayed in Fig.\n2. The corresponding results of < K > = 19.215 \u00b1 0.013 and < J > = 19.687 \u00b1 0.014 were\nfinally adopted as the mean K- and J-band apparent magnitudes of red clump stars in the\nFornax dwarf galaxy.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nUsing the same approach we derived < J > and < K > for red clump stars in the FI\nand FII fields in the SMC, and the FIII field in the LMC. Appropriate data for the fields\nFI and FII in the LMC were adopted from Pietrzy\u0144ski and Gieren (2002). Again, very\ngood agreement of the red clump star magnitudes for the different fields in LMC and SMC,\nrespectively, was found, justifying the procedure to merge the data of the individual fields.\nThis led to the following adopted red clump star magnitudes: < K >LMC = 16.894 \u00b1 0.007,\n< J >LMC = 17.472 \u00b1 0.007, < K >SMC = 17.346 \u00b1 0.018, < J >SMC = 17.857 \u00b1 0.020\nmag. The corresponding fits are displayed in Fig. 3.\nIt is worthwhile noticing that our < K >LMC on the UKIRT system is in very good\nagreement with < K >LMC = 16.974 derived by Alves et al. (2002), on the Koorneef system\n(see Pietrzynski and Gieren 2002, for more details).\nOur fields in the Magellanic Clouds are located so close (within about 0.5 degree) to the\ncenters of these galaxies that any geometrical corrections to the red clump star magnitudes\nof the different fields are expected to be very small. We checked this by applying the\ngeometrical model of van der Marel et al. (2002) for the LMC, and that of Groenewegen\n(2000) for the SMC. The results were consistent with our previous estimations of the red\nclump star mean magnitudes to within 0.01 mag (e.g. clearly less than the accuracy of our\nzero point measurements), justifying our procedure to merge the data of our individual\nfields in the LMC and SMC without previously applying corrections for the geometrical\nstructures of the Clouds.\nIn the case of Carina, the number of red clump stars we found is not large enough to\nderive mean red clump stars magnitudes for the individual fields. However, it should be\nnoted that all our five selected fields are located very close each other (the distance between\nthem is smaller than 10 arcmin), so we decided to merge the observations for the 2 nights\nand different fields and to derive the mean K and J magnitudes of the red clump stars in\nthe same manner as we did for Fornax and the Magellanic Clouds. The fit of function (1) to\nthe combined data for Carina yielded as our adopted, final red clump star mean magnitudes\nfor this galaxy < K > = 18.533 \u00b1 0.015 and < J > = 18.970 \u00b1 0.014 mag. The fits in the\ncase of Carina are shown in Fig. 2.\n\n4.\n\nComparison with other distance indicators\n\nIn Table 3, we give the reddening-corrected < K0 > magnitudes of the red clump\nstars in the LMC, SMC, Carina and Fornax. For comparison, we also give the I-band\nmagnitudes of the TRGB and the mean V-band magnitude of RR Lyrae stars in these\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nTable 2.

The magnitudes for the TRGB and the RR Lyrae stars\nin the Magellanic Clouds and Carina dwarf galaxy were adopted from Udalski (2000b).\n< I TRGB > for Fornax was taken from Bersier (2000). The reddenings towards the Fornax\nand Carina galaxies were derived from the Schlegel, Finkbeiner and Davis (1998) extinction\nmaps, yielding E(B \u2212 V )Car = 0.06 \u00b1 0.01 mag, and E(B \u2212 V )For = 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 mag,\nrespectively. Extinction corrections to our fields in the Magellanic Clouds were applied by\nadopting the appropiate values of E(B-V) from the OGLE II extinction maps in the LMC\n(Udalski et al. 1999a ; E(B \u2212 V )FI,FII = 0.152, E(B \u2212 V )FIII =0.115 mag) and in the SMC\n(Udalski et al. 1999b ; E(B \u2212 V )FI,FII = 0.089) using the reddening law as given by Schlegel\net al. (1998).\nFinally, the mean < K0 > magnitudes of Cepheids at a pulsation period of 10 days in\nthe Magellanic Clouds were calculated using the relations provided by Groenewegen (2000).\nThese are also given in Table 3.\nFor our further discussion, we adopt -0.5 dex for the metallicity of intermediate-age\npopulations in the LMC (Bica et al. 1998, Smecker-Hane et al. 1999), and -1.0 dex for the\nSMC (see Udalski 2000b for a discussion). For Fornax, we assume [Fe/H] = -1.0 (Saviane,\nHeld and Bertelli, 2000; Tolstoy et al. 2002). From spectroscopic metallicity determinations\nof 52 stars in Carina, Smecker-Hane et al. (1999) derived a mean metallicity of red giants\nin this galaxy of -2.0 dex. More recently Tolstoy et al. (2002), using high resolution spectra\nobtained with UVES at the VLT for 5 stars, argued that the mean metallicity of red giant\nstars in the Carina dwarf galaxy is less metal-poor and about -1.6 dex. We adopt the mean\nfrom these two determinations for Carina, e.g. -1.8 dex.\nIt was shown by empirical investigations (Lee, Freedman and Madore 1993; Udalski\n2000b) that the I-band magnitude of the TRGB is independent of population effects in the\nrange of ages and metallicities covered by our 4 target galaxies. Moreover, comparisons\nbetween TRGB distances and Cepheid distances in many galaxies (Lee, Freedman and\nMadore 1993; Kennicutt et al. 1998; Ferrarese et al. 2000; Udalski 2000b) showed excellent\nagreement between these two distance indicators. Therefore, by studying the difference of\n< K0RC > and < I0TRGB > as a function of metallicity and age we should be able to detect\nany population effects on < K0RC >. Fig. 4 shows such a comparison as a function of\nmetallicity. It is appreciated from this diagram that there is clearly no systematical trend in\nthe difference of the red clump K-band magnitude and the TRGB I-band magnitude with\nmetallicity. A linear regression leads to < K0RC > - < I0TRGB > = 2.51, with a dispersion of\nonly 0.04 mag. An analogous comparison of the red clump star mean K-band magnitude\nwith < V0RRLyrae >, where the RR Lyrae mean V-band magnitude has been corrected for a\nmetallicity slope of 0.18 (see Udalski 2000b, and references therein) yields a very similar\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nresult (see Fig. 4, lower panel).\nAnother, independent test of a possible trend of < K0RC > with metallicity can be\ndone using the 2MASS near-infrared photometry of Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds\n(Groenewegen 2000). Here it is worthwhile noticing that there is practically no difference\nbetween the 2MASS Ks-band and the K-band magnitudes in the UKIRT system to which\nour data have been transformed (Carpenter 2001). Using the P-L relations published by\nGroenewegen (2000), we derive < K0RC > - < K0Cep,P=10d > = 4.05 \u00b1 0.02 for the LMC, and\n4.03\u00b10.03 for the SMC, again indicating that this magnitude difference does not depend on\nmetallicity (at least in the metallicity range covered by LMC and SMC).\nAll our comparisons seem to indicate that < K0RC > does not, or very little, depend on\npopulation effects in the very broad metallicity range (-1.8 < [Fe/H] < -0.5) and the very\ndifferent star formation histories covered by our four target galaxies. This is in very good\nagreement with the results of Alves (2000) who also found that the < K0RC > absolute\nmagnitude of red clump stars in the solar neighborhood does not show any significant trend\nwith metallicity in the range from -0.5 to 0.0 dex.\nIn principle, the dependence of < K0RC > on metallicity and age can also be checked\nwith star clusters containing sufficient red clump stars, and spanning a range in ages\nand metallicities. Unfortunately, the number of clusters with available accurate infrared\nphotometry is very low at the present time. A first attempt to study the behaviour of\n< K0RC > in a sample of Galactic clusters was recently performed by Grocholski and\nSarajedini (2002). They took infrared data for 14 open clusters from the 2MASS database\nand found an over-all agreement of the data with model predictions about the dependence\nof the K-band red clump star magnitude on age and metallicity. However, the accuracy\nof their results was clearly limited by the low number of red clump stars in the studied\nclusters, and the distance uncertainies of the clusters inherent in the MS fitting technique\nof distance determination. The typical accuracy of MKRC they were able to achieve was\nabout 0.11-0.2 mag. Still, at least a crude check on the possible age dependence of the\nred clump star K-band absolute magnitude is possible from the Grocholski and Sarajedini\ncluster data. We did this by selecting clusters having ages in the range from 2 Gyr to 9 Gyr\n(covering the age range of the red clump stars in the target galaxies of this paper). Three\nclusters (NGC 6819, M 67 and Be 39) were identified. Their metallicities fall in the range\ncovered by the Hipparcos red clump star sample, therefore no dependence of their MKRC on\nmetallicity is expected (Alves 2000). In Fig. 5, we show MKRC for these clusters versus the\ncluster age. Within the error bars on the absolute magnitudes, no indication of a systematic\ntrend of the red clump star K-band absolute magnitude with age is visible in this diagram,\nsuggesting that the red clump star K-band absolute magnitude is not only very insensitive\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nto metallicity, but also to age, over a broad range of ages.\n\n5.\n\nPopulation dependence of red clump star magnitudes in the I and J bands\n\nWe can now trace out the population dependence of the < I >RC\nand < J >RC\n0\n0\nmagnitudes very accurately, studying the relative magnitudes of these stars in our target\ngalaxies. The I-band data for the red clump stars in the different galaxies were taken from\nthe literature (Udalski et al. 1998, Udalski et al. 2000, Udalski 2000b for LMC, SMC and\nCarina; Bersier 2000 for Fornax) and were dereddened in exactly the same way as our\ninfrared data presented in this paper.\n\u2212 < K0RC > and\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, the differences of < I >RC\n0\n< J >RC\n\u2212 < K0RC > are both strongly corelated with metallicity. Least-squares fits to\n0\na straight line give the following slopes: 0.09\u00b10.02, and 0.13 +-0.02 mag/dex, for the\nmetallicity dependence of < J >RC\nand < I >RC\n0\n0 , respectively. This result is in amazing\nagreement with the former result of Udalski (2000a) on the metallicity dependence of the\nred clump star I-band magnitude, who had obtained < I >RC\n0 = (0.14 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 [F e/H])\n+ const, from a study of the Hipparcos red clump stars with high-quality spectroscopic\nmetallicity determinations in the range from 0 to -0.5 dex. The dependence of < J >RC\non\n0\nRC\nmetallicity is found to be slightly weaker than that of < I >0 , as one could expect from\nthe effective wavelengths of the J-band (1.2 \u03bc) and I-band (0.8 \u03bc).\n\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn Fig. 7, we present the difference between the relative < I0 > magnitudes of\nred clump stars derived with respect to the LMC, and corrected for their metallicity\ndependence, and their < K0 > magnitudes (also relative to the LMC). It is clearly seen\nthat in all environments except the solar neigborhood there is excellent agreement between\nthe relative brightnesses of the red clump stars in these two bands. This finding suggests\nthat there may be a very significant zero-point error, in the order of 0.2 mag, in either the\nK-band, or in the I-band photometry of the local Hipparcos red clump stars (of course it is\nalso possible that the current local calibrations have significant errors in both bands).\nTransforming our K-band data to the Koorneef system with the transformations\nprovided by Carpenter (2001), and using the K-band absolute calibration of Alves (2000)\nwe derive the following true distance moduli from K-band red clump star magnitudes to\nthe target galaxies of the present study:\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nTable 3.

The\nLMC distance result is in excellent agreement with our own former result (Pietrzynski and\nGieren 2002) which was based on smaller number of fields, and with the recent independent\ndistance determinations to the LMC from red clump star K-band photometry of Alves et\nal. (2002), and Sarajedini et al. (2002).\nThe above distance moduli are to be compared with those obtained from I-band data\ncorrected for their metallicity dependence: 18.26\u00b10.07 mag for the LMC (Udalski 2000b);\n18.71\u00b10.07 for the SMC (Udalski 2000b); 19.96 \u00b1 0.08 for Carina (Udalski 2000b), and\n20.60 for Fornax (Bersier, 2000).\nWe then find, as already discussed and shown in Fig. 7, that there is a near-constant\ndifference of about 0.2 mag between the distances derived to our target galaxies from\nK-band and I-band magnitudes of red clump stars, using the local solar neighborhood\ncalibrations of Alves (2000) for the K band and of Udalski (2000a) for the I band. It will\nbe of obvious importance to check on these calibrations in the near future to find out if this\nway the results from both bands can be reconciled.\nFinally, our current empirical results provide a very strong test on the accuracy of the\nso-called population corrections derived from stellar models and assuming a star formation\nhistory and chemical evolution history for both the solar neighborhood, and a given target\ngalaxy ( Girardi and Salaris, 2002). Using the Girardi and Salaris (2002) corrections for\nthe K band, one obtains dSMC \u2212 dLMC = 0.43 mag and dCAR \u2212 dLMC = 1.53 mag. If we\ncompare these values with the empirical results for the distance difference between SMC\nand LMC (0.47\u00b10.03 mag from RC in K without corrections; 0.50\u00b10.04 mag from TRBG;\n0.52\u00b10.03 from RR Lyrae stars; 0.49\u00b10.03 from Cepheids in the K band) and for the\ndistance difference between Carina and the LMC (1.70 \u00b1 0.05 from TRGB; 1.71 \u00b1 0.03\nfrom RR Lyrae stars; and 1.67 \u00b1 0.03 from the RC in K), we can conclude that the current\naccuracy of the predictions of such models is about 0.1-0.15 mag. (see also the discussion\nin Pietrzy\u0144ski and Gieren, 2002). Athough it is quite impressive that in spite of the rather\npoorly known SFH and chemical evolution histories in these galaxies one can get results\nfrom the models whose agreement with accurate empirical data is in the order of 0.1-0.15\nmag, such an approach is clearly of less use for accurate distance determinations to nearby\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ngalaxies, at the present time.\nWe are grateful to the European Southern Observatory for allocating observing time\nto this project with ISAAC on the VLT telescope, and with SOFI on the NTT telescope.

The metallicities of these clusters all lie in the range covered by the Hipparcos-observed\nred clump stars, so no dependence of MRC\nK on metallicity is expected (Alves 2000).

It can be seen that in all environments this difference is very close to\nzero, the exception being the solar neighborhood red clump stars. This suggests that the\nphotometric data for the Hipparcos-observed red clump stars probably have a zero point\nerror in the order of 0.2 mag in either the K or the I band.\n\n\f"}
