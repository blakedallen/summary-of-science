Even though these simulations are still at an early stage, their\nresults are already very instructive, especially when one is interested in the low-energy dynamics of\nstrong interactions. Indeed, there is a deep connection between these first-principle simulations and\nthe effective description of the light hadronic degrees of freedom, i.e., Chiral Perturbation Theory\n(\u03c7PT) [1, 2]. The ability for the lattice to investigate the quark-mass dependence of hadronic observables opens the possibility to determine some poorly known \u03c7PT low-energy constants. Conversely,\nthe chiral expansions derived within \u03c7PT can be used to extrapolate or interpolate lattice data down\nto the physical light quark masses.\nIt turns out that several collaborations performing simulations with 2+1 dynamical quarks reported difficulties when fitting their data with Nf = 3 next-to-leading-order (NLO) chiral expansions\nfor pseudoscalar masses, decay constants, and Kl3 form factors [3, 4, 5, 6], forcing some of the collaborations to rely on Nf = 2 chiral expansions only (for instance using on Heavy-Kaon \u03c7PT to perform\ntheir extrapolations [7]). Moreover, some chiral order parameters (in particular the quark condensate\nand the decay constant) were seen to decrease significantly when one moved from the Nf = 2 chiral\nlimit where mu , md \u2192 0 but ms is kept at its physical value [1] to the Nf = 3 chiral limit where\nmu , md , ms \u2192 0 [2]. Defining the chiral order parameters in these two chiral limits (denoted limNf\nfor simplicity):\n\u03a3(Nf ) = \u2212limNf h0|\u016bu|0i ,\nF 2 (Nf ) = limNf F\u03c02 ,\n(1)\nPACS-CS [3] and MILC [8, 9] quote for instance:\nPACS \u2212 CS :\nMILC :\n\nF (2)\n= 1.089 \u00b1 0.045 ,\nF (3)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nF (2)\n+0.10\n= 1.15 \u00b1 0.05\n,\n\u22120.03\nF (3)\n\n\u03a3(2)\n= 1.245 \u00b1 0.010 ,\n\u03a3(3)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a3(2)\n+0.38\n= 1.52 \u00b1 0.17\n.\n\u22120.15\n\u03a3(3)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nAssuming that there are no intrinsic problems with the lattice data, these results can be interpreted as\nthe fact that the Nf = 3 chiral series do not converge quickly, because their leading-order term in the\nchiral counting is not numerically dominant and competes with (formally) higher-order contributions.\nCalculations up to NNLO are clearly useful to settle the issue [10, 11, 12, 13]. An exploratory study\nof the RBC/UKQCD data [4, 5] on Kl3 form factors and FK /F\u03c0 (the ratio of the kaon and pion\ndecay constants) showed that NNLO terms are not negligible though of the expected size, the NLO\nterms of some observables being in this particular study anomalously small for some known reasons.\nHowever, this study did not consider the RBC/UKQCD result for the decay constant F\u03c0 itself, which\ndoes not exhibit the quark-mass dependence predicted by chiral perturbation theory [4, 14].\nQuite interestingly, a similar pattern with suppressed Nf = 3 chiral order parameters seems to\nemerge from the experimental data on \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c0K scattering, indicating a good convergence of Nf = 2\nchiral series for pion observables [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], but difficulties in Nf = 3 chiral series,\neven once NNLO terms are included and modeled through resonance saturation [23, 24]. As recalled\nin refs. [10, 25, 26], the situation seems to be well under control in the \u03c0\u03c0 system, but the fits yield\nsometimes contradictions once \u03c0K data is considered. It was advocated in refs. [27, 28] that such a\nsituation could indeed occur in the low-energy dynamics of QCD and it was highlighted there that\nthe strange quark may play a very special role, due to its light mass of order O(\u039bQCD ). Significant\nvacuum fluctuations of ss\u0304 pairs may lead to instabilities in the convergence of \u03c7PT expansions, where\ninstabilities are defined as a numerical competition between the terms considered as leading and nextto-leading in the chiral counting. This effect would be related to a large violation of the Zweig rule\nin the scalar sector, indicated by values of the O(p4 ) LECs L4 and L6 significantly different from\nspecific (\"critical\") values [29, 30] (see also refs. [31, 32] for reviews of the subject and a discussion\nof the baryon sector).\n1\n\n\fA pessimistic way of considering the problem would consist in dismissing the whole \u03c7PT as soon\nas problems of convergence arise. A less restrictive point of view was adopted in ref. [33], assuming\nthat:\n\u2022 only some (\"good\") observables have convergent expansions, when expressed in terms of the\ncouplings arising in the chiral Lagrangian.\n\u2022 a series is considered as convergent when the sum of LO and NLO terms is large compared to\nthe remaining part of the series.\n\u2022 the resulting formulae must be treated analytically, without neglecting higher-order corrections\nwhen reexpressing low-energy constants in terms of observables.\nThis framework was coined Resummed Chiral Perturbation Theory (Re\u03c7PT) for reasons that will\nbe recalled later in the present article. In particular, a specific prescription for the unitarity pieces,\ndescribed in sec. 2.2, will be added to this set of assumptions, defining precisely how we choose to\nsplit the chiral series of the chosen observables between leading, next-to-leading and higher orders in\nour framework.\nThe recent 2 + 1 dynamical simulations provide new and relevant information on the impact\nof ss\u0304 fluctuations related to the presence of strange quarks in the sea. Conversely, Re\u03c7PT can\nprovide a more appropriate treatment of chiral extrapolations if the hints of suppressed Nf = 3\nquark condensate and decay constants are confirmed. In principle, this analysis would require lattice\ndata performed with several u, d, s quark masses (whose renormalized values are known) and transfer\nmomenta (in the case of form factors, scattering amplitudes), but where the continuum and infinitevolume limit have already been performed (a \u2192 0, L \u2192 \u221e). Unfortunately, such data sets are\nnot (yet) available. Some collaborations [e.g., MILC [8, 9]] provide numbers directly in the physical\nlimit, performing the chiral extrapolation at the same time as the continuum limit. This prevents one\nfrom testing different alternatives concerning chiral extrapolation, even though the results sometimes\ncontradict the usual assumptions of \u03c7PT (for instance concerning the size of the quark condensate\nand the decay constant). Others [BMW [34, 35], ETMC [36], TWQCD-JLQCD [37]] do not provide\nthe decay constants and the renormalized quark masses mandatory for such a study. Finally, some\ncollaborations [RBC/UKQCD [4, 5, 6], PACS-CS [3]] have performed their analysis only at one\nparticular lattice spacing and/or one particular volume, without estimating the systematics associated\nwith the continuum and infinite-volume limits fully.\nIn view of this situation, we will restrict ourselves to the studies made by RBC/UKQCD and\nPACS-CS. The fact that only statistical errors are quoted in both cases prevents us from using a\nfull-fledged statistical treatment [25], but we hope that our limited study will provide some incentive\nfor lattice collaborations to apply the same framework to their data when performing chiral extrapolations. In Sec. 2 we provide the basics of our procedure with the illustration of the electromagnetic\nform factor of the pion, and we recall the results obtained for the masses and decay constants. In\nSecs. 3 and 4, we apply the same formalism to the electromagnetic form factor of the kaon and the\nKl3 form factors. In Sec. 5, we consider the same observables in the case of lattice simulations for\nnon-physical values of the quark masses. In Sec. 6, we fit our chiral expansions to different sets of lattice data, and analyse the emerging pattern of Nf = 3 chiral symmetry breaking, before concluding.\nAn appendix summarises the main features of the results obtained by the two lattice collaborations\nwhich are analysed in this article.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nGeneral arguments and the electromagnetic form factor of the\npion\nExpansion of \"good\" observables\n\nAs explained in greater details in refs. [38, 33, 25], if one expects a numerical competition between LO\nand NLO chiral series of quantities of interest, one cannot perform expansions on arbitrary functions\nof such quantities. Let us assume for instance that an observable A has the following chiral expansion:\nA = ALO + AN LO + A\u03b4A\n\n(4)\n\nThe statement of a good convergence of the series correspond to \u03b4A much smaller than 1, but it does\nnot involve necessarily that ALO is dominant numerically with respect to the rest of the series.\nOne has the formal chiral expansion for any observable F = f (A):\nF\n\n= FLO + FN LO + F \u03b4F ,\n\n(5)\n\u2032\n\nFLO = f (ALO )\nFN LO = AN LO f (ALO ) ,\n\u2032\nf (ALO ) f (ALO )\n\u03b4F = 1 \u2212\n\u2212\n[A \u2212 ALO \u2212 A\u03b4A] .\nf (A)\nf (A)\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nDepending on the value of XA = ALO /A, i.e., the saturation of the chiral expansion of A by its first\nterm, the chiral series of F may or may not converge well. One has in particular the two limiting\nbehaviours:\nXA \u2192 1\nXA \u2192 0\n\nf \u2032 (A)\nA\u03b4A ,\nf (A)\nf \u2032 (0)\nf \u2032 (0)\nf (0)\n\u2212\nA+\nA\u03b4A .\n\u03b4F \u2192 1 \u2212\nf (A) f (A)\nf (A)\n\n\u03b4F \u2192 \u2212\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nIn the first case, a bound on \u03b4A implies a bound on \u03b4F , meaning that F converges well provided\nthat A does. But in the second case, the size of \u03b4F is by \u221a\nno means driven by that of \u03b4A. As an\nillustration, if we take the \"observables\" B = 1/A and C = A, we obtain:\n\u03b4A\n(1 \u2212 XA )2\n\u2212 2 ,\n2\nXA\nXA\n1p\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b4A .\n\u03b4C = 1 \u2212 \u221a\nXA \u2212 \u221a\n2 XA 2\n2 XA\n\n\u03b4B =\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nEven if we set \u03b4A = 0, we would need XA = ALO /A above 41% to ensure that |\u03b4B| < 10%, and XA\nabove 76% to ensure that |\u03b4C| < 10%.\nTherefore, if the chiral expansions of some of the observables considered are not saturated by\ntheir leading-order term, we cannot take an arbitrary function of these observables, consider its\nchiral expansion, and assume that it will converge. In such a situation, one has therefore to select\nthe right set of observables for which converging series can be written. Actually, this statement\nof convergence is equivalent to state that the generating functional of QCD is well reproduced at\nlow energies by \u03c7PT. The quantities that are assumed to have convergent chiral series from the\nstarting point of chiral perturbation theory are the QCD correlators of axial and vector currents\nas well as pseudoscalar and scalar densities. In addition, the convergence is expected to be good\nonly away from the singularities (poles, cuts . . . ) corresponding to resonances and channel openings.\nObservables involving pseudoscalar mesons as external states will be obtained by applying the LSZ\nreduction formula on correlators involving axial currents, which will yields additional factors of the\npseudoscalar decay constants. One can easily state some of the observables associated to each O(p4 )\nLEC that are simple to determine on lattice simulations and/or to extract from experiment:\n3\n\n\f\u2022 L1 , L2 , L3 : Kl4 form factors (F\u03c02 FK f, F\u03c02 FK g, F\u03c02 FK h),\n2 ),\n\u2022 L4 , L5 : \u03c0, K decay constants (F\u03c02 , FK\n2 M 2 ),\n\u2022 L6 , L8 : \u03c0, K masses (F\u03c02 M\u03c02 , FK\nK\n\n\u2022 L7 : \u03b7 mass and decay constant (F\u03b72 , F\u03b72 M\u03b72 ),\n\u2022 L9 : Pion electromagnetic form factor (F\u03c02 FV\u03c0 ),\n\u2022 L10 : \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd\u03b3 form factor (F\u03c0 AV AP ) and \u03c4 spectral functions (V V \u2212 AA).\nWe will define the expansion of a \"good\" observable through the following procedure:\n\u2022 We take the chiral expansion of the observable in terms of the couplings of the effective Lagrangian (low-energy constants, or LECs: B0 , F0 , Li . . . ).\n\u2022 We replace the pseudoscalar masses at leading order by the physical ones only when physical\narguments indicate that the convergence of the series will be improved. In practice we perform\nthis replacement so that the nonanalytic structures imposed by unitarity are located at the\nphysical poles, thresholds. . .\n\u2022 We keep track of the remainders (collecting NNLO contributions and higher orders) explicitly\nand treat the resulting chiral expansions as algebraic identities, without performing further\nexpansions.\nFollowing this procedure (and taking the isospin limit mu = md = m), observables can be\nexpressed in terms of LO quantities:\nX(3) =\n\n2m\u03a3(3)\n,\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n\nZ(3) =\n\nF 2 (3)\n,\nF\u03c02\n\nr=\n\nms\n,\nm\n\n(12)\n\nas well as NLO LECs and remainders. The first two quantities in eq. (12) are of particular relevance,\nsince they express two main order parameters of Nf = 3 chiral symmetry breaking, the quark\ncondensate and the pseudoscalar decay constant, in physical units. They also assess the saturation of\nthe chiral expansion of F\u03c02 M\u03c02 and F\u03c02 by their leading order. The third quantity measures the relative\nsize of the quark masses in a framework where the strange quark is supposed to play a peculiar role\nin the chiral structure of QCD vacuum. In the following, we will also use the quantity Y (3):\nY (3) =\n\nX(3)\n2mB0\n,\n=\n2\nM\u03c0\nZ(3)\n\n(13)\n\nwhich assesses the saturation of the chiral expansion of the pion mass by its leading order. Up to now,\nwe have considered the masses and decay constants of Goldstone bosons [28, 30, 38] and observables\nderived from \u03c0\u03c0 scattering [38, 33] in this framework.\nExploiting the fact that some quantities describing the dynamics of pseudoscalar mesons are well\nmeasured and inverting the relationships between these observables and LECs, we can express the\nO(p4 ) LECs in terms of\n\u2022 Masses, decay constants, form factors. . .\n\u2022 The three leading-order parameters described in eq. (12)\n\u2022 The remainders associated to each observable, assumed to be small (convergence).\n\n4\n\n\fThese expressions can be exploited in the chiral expansions of other \"good\" observables, in order to\nexpress the latter quantities in terms of LO quantities and remainders only. The comparison with\nexperimental information should then provide more information on the pattern of chiral symmetry\nbreaking in the Nf = 3 chiral limit.\nAs shown in refs. [38, 33, 25], this procedure applied to masses and decay constants allows one\nto resum higher-order contributions in chiral series from L4 and L6 low-energy constants, which\nencode the effect of ss\u0304 pairs on the structure of the chiral vacuum. It may induce a significant ms dependence in the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking and can generate a numerical competition\nbetween LO and NLO in Nf = 3 chiral series. This feature is related to the name of Resummed\nChiral Perturbation Theory chosen to describe this particular treatment of chiral expansions. This\nframework is compatible with the usual treatment of chiral series in the limit where the latter are\nsaturated by their LO term, but it allows for a consistent treatment of the series even if there is a\nsignificant competition of LO and NLO contributions for some of the observables.\n\n2.2\n\nElectromagnetic form factor\n\nWe will illustrate our procedure with the example of the electromagnetic pion form factor\nh\u03c0 + |j\u03bc |\u03c0 + i = (p + p\u2032 )\u03bc FV\u03c0 (t) ,\n(14)\n\u221a\nwhere the electromagnetic current is j\u03bc = V\u03bc3 + V\u03bc8 / 3, p (p\u2032 ) is the momentum of the incoming\n(outgoing) pion, and t = (p\u2032 \u2212 p)2 . As explained in Sec. 2.1, we obtain this form factor in \u03c7PT from\nh(A\u03bc\u03c0+ )\u2020 A\u03bd\u03c0+ j \u03bc i, leading to the product F\u03c02 FV\u03c0 through the LSZ reduction formula (the pion decay\nconstant F\u03c0 stems from the wave-function renormalisation). In the case of the electromagnetic form\nfactor, \"good\" observables are thus obtained from F\u03c02 FV\u03c0 at low energies away from singularities, i.e.,\nthe right-hand cuts, starting from t \u2265 4M\u03c02 .\nWe obtain the following bare expansion, in agreement with Refs.

We have added RF\u03c02 FV\u03c0 (t), a polynomial function of t\ncollecting remainders:\nRF\u03c02 FV\u03c0 (t) = (RF\u03c02 FV\u03c0 )0 +\n\nt\n(RF\u03c02 FV\u03c0 )1 + O(t2 ) ,\nF\u03c02\n\n(17)\n\nwith (RF\u03c02 FV\u03c0 )0 = O(m2q ) and (RF\u03c02 FV\u03c0 )1 = O(mq ).\nAt next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion, the nonanalytic dependence on quark masses\nand momenta arises through the unitarity function J \u0304P Q . Following our prescription, we compute\n\n5\n\n\f2 , M 2 , rather than their\nthe functions J \u0304 (and J \u0304 = J \u0304 \u2212 sJ \u0304\u2032 (0)) with the physical values of M\u03c02 , MK\n\u03b7\nleading-order expansion, i.e. we define the chiral expansion in Re\u03c7PT as eq.

(15) features a unitarity cut from the two-pion channel\nstarting at t = 4M\u03c02 (id. for the two-kaon channel). Indeed, from general arguments of unitarity, we\n\u25e6 2\n\nknow that the higher-order corrections will shift the start of the right-hand cut from 4 M P to 4MP2 .\nUnfortunately, unitarity does not provide us more information on the structure of the cut (and in\nparticular the coefficient multiplying the J \u0304 function) due to the perturbative nature of the chiral\nexpansion.\nWhen needed, we will obtain the Re\u03c7PT expansion of other observables by performing the same\nreplacement for the functions J \u0304 and J \u0304 occurring in the definition of the loop integrals KP Q , LP Q and\nMPr Q in ref. [2]. However, we do not perform any further replacement neither in the unitary functions\nnor in the rest of the expressions: for instance, we have not modified the functions multiplying the\nJ \u0304 functions, nor the chiral logarithms coming from the tadpole terms in eq. (15), since we have no\nway of determining if the latter modifications would improve or spoil the convergence of the series 1 .\nAdopting a dispersive point of view, we can say that the position of the cuts are imposed by unitarity,\nbut not the value of the induced imaginary parts at low energies and that of the subtraction constants\n(polynomials).\nOne checks easily that the NLO chiral expansion of the electromagnetic form factor in ref. [39]\ncan be recovered:\nFV\u03c0 (t) = 1 + 2H\u03c0\u03c0 (t) + HKK (t) + O(p4 ) ,\n(19)\nwith\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0001\nMP2\n1\nt\n2t r\nt 1\n1\n2  \u0304\nL .\nt \u2212 4MP JP P (t) \u2212\nlog 2 + 1 +\n+\nHP P (t) = 2\n2\n2\n6 32\u03c0\n\u03bc\n288\u03c0\nF0 12\n3F02 9\n\n(20)\n\nIn the case where F0 is small compared to F\u03c0 , as hinted at by lattice simulations and NNLO fits of\nchiral series [26, 42], F\u03c02 FV\u03c0 (t) is expected to exhibit a better convergence than FV\u03c0 (t) in our framework\naccording to Eqs. (19)-(20). Similar expressions hold for other observables: good observables will\ngenerally come multiplied by powers of physical pseudoscalar decay constants (one for each external\npseudoscalar meson involved).\n\n2.3\n\nPion electromagnetic square radius\n\nThe electromagnetic square radius of the pion is the low-energy observable associated with FV\u03c0 :\nF\u03c02 hr 2 i\u03c0V = 6F\u03c02\n\ndFV\u03c0\n(0) .\ndt\n\n(21)\n\nFollowing the previous discussion of the form factor, the product of F\u03c02 and hr 2 i\u03c0V is the quantity\nexpected to exhibit a good convergence in our framework. eq.

[25], where this substitution was performed\neverywhere in the unitarity functions J, K, L, M and in the tadpole logarithms. It turns out that the difference is\nusually very small: the unitarity functions yield only a small contribution below the first threshold, and there is only\na logarithmic difference in the case of the tadpole.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere we have introduced the scale-independent combination \u2206L9 = Lr9 (\u03bc) \u2212 L\u0302r9 (\u03bc), with:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u25e6 2\n\u25e6 2\n1\n1 \uf8f01\nM\nM\nlog 2\u03c0 +\nlog 2K \uf8fb ,\nL\u0302r9 (\u03bc) =\n32\u03c0 2 6\n\u03bc\n12\n\u03bc\n\nand\n\ne\u03c0V =\n\n6 (RF\u03c02 F\u03c0V )1\n.\nF\u03c04 hr 2 i\u03c0V\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nThe pion electromagnetic square radius is well-determined, and it is expected to suffer only mildly\nfrom higher-order corrections being an observable involving pions.

(39)-(42). L9 (M\u03c1 )\ncan thus be estimated as a function of r, Y (3) and NNLO remainder. For instance, if we take Y (3) = 1\n2 /M 2 \u2212 1 (corresponding to LO estimates holding in the case of a fast convergence) and\nand r = 2MK\n\u03c0\nthe central experimental value [43]:\nhr 2 i\u03c0V = 0.451 \u00b1 0.031 fm2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwe obtain 2 Lr9 (M\u03c1 ) = 6.77*10\u22123 in the ball park of usual estimates of this LEC, such as (6.9\u00b10.7)*10\u22123\nat O(p4 ) in Ref.

[25, 33, 38]. Note that contrary to the case of L9 , these LECs always appear multiplied\nby powers of Y (3) in chiral series, since they correspond to operators with one or two powers of the\nscalar source in the chiral Lagrangian, and arise in chiral expansions always multiplied by one or\ntwo powers of B0 . Therefore, when Y (3) tends to zero, L\u0302i will exhibit a logarithmically divergent\nbehaviour (due to the tadpole logarithms) which will not affect observables though.\n\n3\n\nKaon electromagnetic form factors\n\nThe method described in the previous section can easily be generalized to other observables. Of\nparticular interest are the kaon electromagnetic form factors and the K\u03c0 form factor which will be\ndiscussed in the following sections.\n\n3.1\n\nDefinition\n\nThe kaon vector form factors [39, 41] are defined as:\n+\n\n0\n\nhK + |j\u03bc |K + i = (p + p\u2032 )\u03bc FVK (t) ,\n\nhK 0 |j\u03bc |K 0 i = (p + p\u2032 )\u03bc FVK (t) ,\n\n(46)\n\nwith the same convention as in the case of the pion electromagnetic form factor. All of them are\nassociated with the P -wave projection of the crossed channel. Following the discussion in 2, we\n2 F K + and F 2 F K 0 to have good convergence properties away from the singularities (opening\nexpect FK\nV\nK V\nthresholds. . . ).

We have divided the expressions of the form factors eqs.

For comparison, these quantities have been calculated in standard\nsuppressed compared to \u2206\n\u03c7PT at one-loop order in the isospin limit [47]:\n\u2206CT = \u22123.5 * 10\u22123 ,\n\n \u0303 CT = 0.03 .\n\u2206\n\n(75)\n\nIt has in fact been shown in refs. [48, 49] that a precise assessment of the scalar form factor at the\nCallan-Treiman points could probe physics beyond the Standard Model in the strange quark sector, in\nparticular right-handed couplings of quarks to W bosons. The pioneering work [48] led to a reanalysis\nof Kl3 data by several collaborations [50, 51, 52], which at present show a good/marginal agreement\nwith the Standard Model except for the NA48 collaboration [50] exhibiting a 4.5\u03c3 deviation still\nunsolved.\nThe Kl3 vector form factor at zero momentum transfer is another quantity of interest. Indeed, the\nmeasurement of Kl3 decays can be analysed in the framework of the Standard Model to determine\nthe product |Vus f+ (0)|, and thus the CKM matrix element |Vus |. A recent fit to |Vud | (from superallowed 0+ \u2192 0+ nuclear decays), |Vus |f+ (0) (from Kl3 ), and |Vus /Vud |FK /F\u03c0 (from \u03c0l2 and Kl2 )\ntogether with the unitarity of the CKM matrix led to [44]\nf+ (0)\n\nSM\n\n= 0.959 \u00b1 0.005 ,\n\n(76)\n\nand a value of FK /F\u03c0 SM in full agreement with eq.(34) with a strong correlation between these two\nquantities.\nDeviation of f+ (0) from this value would be an indication of new physics, so that this quantity\nplays a particularly important role to test the Standard Model in the light quark sector. A direct\ndetermination of these quantities on the lattice as well as a well-controlled method to extrapolate\nlattice data down to the physical quark masses are naturally crucial to get a proper assessment of\nthe uncertainties (from statistical, but also systematic origins).\n\n5\n\nObservables for lattice simulations at different quark masses\n\nAs explained in the previous section, we can use the relations eqs. (35)-(36) (decay constants),\neqs. (37)-(38) (masses), eq. (25) (pion electromagnetic square radius). . . to express NLO LECs in\nterms of r, X(3), Z(3), accurately measured observables and remainders. These relations can be\ninserted in the chiral expansions of other observables (such as kaon or Kl3 form factors, or mesonmeson scattering), which can be used to constrain r, X(3) and Z(3). For each new observable, one or\n13\n\n\fseveral remainders are introduced, which are assumed to be small but nevertheless limit the accuracy\nof the chiral series.\nAs indicated in the introduction, one can also consider lattice simulations, where the same observables are considered at different values of the quark masses. The interest is twofold. First, the lattice\nsimulations probe the ms -sensitivity of observables, hard to estimate from continuum measurements,\nbut with deep connection with the pattern of Nf = 3 chiral symmetry breaking. Second, lattice\nsimulations [RBC/UKQCD [4, 5, 6], PACS-CS [3]] have encountered difficulties in their fits of NLO\nNf = 3 chiral expansions. Let us remark that the inclusion of NNLO terms for Kl3 form factors\nand FK /F\u03c0 to fits of the RBC/UKQCD data seems to solve convergence issues for these particular\nquantities assuming no Zweig-rule violation in the scalar sector [42]: a good \u03c72 is obtained with a\nrather good convergence of the chiral series with NNLO terms of the expected size (this work did\nnot discuss F\u03c0 itself, for which the problems of convergence seem the most acute [4, 14]).\nFitting these data will offer us the opportunity to extract relevant information on chiral symmetry\nbreaking and to check the consistency of our picture concerning the numerical competition between\nLO and NLO terms. We consider simulations with 3 dynamical flavours (m\u0303, m\u0303, m\u0303s ) and denote X\u0303\nthe values for the lattice quantities (and X the corresponding value for physical quark masses). We\nintroduce the ratios:\nm\u0303\nm\u0303s\n,\nq=\n,\n(77)\np=\nms\nm\u0303s\nin addition to the ratio of physical quark masses r and the chiral parameters arising in the leadingorder Lagrangian in eqs.

In the above formulae, the decay constants on the\nright-hand side arise from the reexpression of L4 and L5 , and should be understood as a short-hand\nnotation of the full expressions in eqs.

These remainders collect all the contributions coming from\nNNLO, NNNLO and higher orders. They can be evaluated by resonance saturation [53], involving a\nhadronic scale \u039bH only mildly affected by the actual value of the quark masses (mass of the \u03c1, K \u2217 . . .).\nIn order to keep track of the scaling of the remainders with the quark masses, we take the following\nNNLO estimates which involves the hadronic scale at the fourth power:\n\u0012 2 2\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 4\u0013\n2 \u0013\nF\u03c0 MK\nMK\n6 MK\nV\n,\ne+ = O\n,\ne\u03c0 = O\n, (85)\nd, e, dK , eK , d+ = O\nhr 2 i\u03c0V \u039b4H\n\u039b4H\n\u039b4H\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 2\u0013\n2 \u0013\n2M\u03c02 MK\n2F\u03c0 M\u03c0\n\u2032 \u2032\nd , e , d\u2212 = O\n,\ne\u2212 = O\n,\n(86)\n4\n\u039bH\n\u039b4H\nd\u03c0 = d \u2212 d\u2032 ,\ne\u03c0 = e \u2212 e\u2032 ,\n(87)\n15\n\n\f2 follow the known dependence of the remainders on m and m , whereas F 2 is\nwhere M\u03c02 and MK\ns\n\u03c0\ninserted when a dimensionful constant with no dependence on mq is required.\nWe can use the known scaling of the remainders to perform their extrapolation to the simulated\nquark masses:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr+1\nFK MK 2 2 r + 1\n\u2032\n2\n2\n\u2032\n \u0303\n \u0303\np\nqrd ,\nd\u2212\n(88)\nd\u03c0 = p d \u2212 p qrd ,\ndK =\nF\u03c0 M\u03c0\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nFK 2 2\nr+1\n2\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u1ebd\u03c0 = p e \u2212 p qre ,\n\u1ebdK =\np e\u2212\nqre ,\n(89)\nF\u03c0\n2\nd \u0303+ = p2 d+ ,\n\u1ebd+ = pe+ ,\nd \u0303\u2212 = p2 qrd\u2212 ,\n\u1ebd\u2212 = pqre\u2212 .\n(90)\n\n6\n\nFit to lattice values\n\n6.1\n\nData and parameters\n\nWe are now in a position to build the \u03c72 function to be minimised for the sets of data that we will\nconsider. The inputs are the following ones, as recalled in App. A:\n2 , F\u0303 2 M\u0303 2 , F\u0303 2 M\u0303 2 for known values of the quark masses (m\u0303, m\u0303 ) (RBC/UKQCD and\n\u2022 F\u0303\u03c02 , F\u0303K\ns\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nK K\nPACS-CS)\n\n\u2022 F\u0303\u03c0 F\u0303K f \u0303+ and F\u0303\u03c0 F\u0303K f \u03030 for several transfer momenta (RBC/UKQCD)\n\u2022 We consider the quantities given by these collaborations corresponding to light quark masses\nand small momenta (\"Subset\" fit) where chiral perturbation theory is valid.\nIn Appendix B we will also consider all the quantities available even though some points at\nhigher masses and momenta might certainly be outside the region of validity of Re\u03c7PT (\"Total\" fit)\nto check the stability of our results as well as to illustrate the interest of having more data points\nto determine the remainders more accurately. Obviously, we would need more points for lower pion\nand kaon masses.\nThe uncertainties on these quantities were obtained by combining the uncertainties in quadrature:\nno correlation between the various observables is provided in the articles of both collaborations, and\nwe have only the statistical errors (no estimate of the systematic uncertainties was available for the\nquantities of interest here). The parameters entering the fit are:\n\u2022 Quantities from the leading-order chiral Lagrangian X(3), Z(3), r\n\u2022 NNLO remainders: d, d\u2032 , e, e\u2032 (in all cases), d+ , e+ , d\u2212 , e\u2212 , eV\u03c0 (for a fit to Kl3 decay constants),\n\u2022 The value of the ratio of decay constants FK /F\u03c0 ,\n\u2022 The value of pref = m\u0303s,ref /ms for a lattice set of reference, providing the equivalence between\nlattice and physical quark masses (when possible).\nThe last quantity is estimated by both collaborations, but we found it interesting to keep this parameter free in the fit, in order to take partially into account systematic effects related to lattice spacing.\nSince the quark masses are expressed in a mass-independent scheme involving only multiplicative\nrenormalisation, we can determine the value of p = m\u0303s /ms for any lattice set once we know p for a\ngiven reference set using m\u0303s = (m\u0303s /m\u0303s,ref ) * pref . We had to fix the last two parameters in the case\nof RBC/UKQCD \"Subset\" fits, due to the limited number of unitarity (unquenched) points available\nfor the masses and decay constants (only 2 different pairs of quark masses).\nWhen computing the values of the observables from NLO chiral expansions, we need the values\nof the masses and decay constants for the simulated quark masses (for instance in the unitarity\n16\n\n\f \u0304 In such a case, we computed systematically the values of the decay constants and\nfunctions J).\nmasses from their chiral expansions (78)-(82), rather than plugging in their \"measured\" values on\nthe lattice. This distinction may have some importance for the Kl3 form factors eqs. (63) and (69),\n2 , but where the latter quantities stand\nwhere we have reexpressed L4 and L5 in terms of F\u0303\u03c02 and F\u0303K\nfor their chiral expansion in terms of LECs (the fits to RBC/UKQCD would be slightly improved\n2 rather than the\ncompared to the ones presented here if we used the measured values of F\u0303\u03c02 and F\u0303K\ncomputed ones).\nIn addition, the mass M\u0303\u03b7 and decay constant F\u0303\u03b7 of the \u03b7 are needed for the evaluation of the\nloop integral J \u0304P Q (and related unitarity functions). They are obtained at a sufficient accuracy for\nsuch purposes using the two following LO formulae reminiscent of the Gell-Mann-Okubo relation:\nF\u0303\u03b72 =\n\n1\n4 2\nF\u0303 \u2212 F\u0303 2 ,\n3 K 3 \u03c0\n\nF\u0303\u03b72 M\u0303\u03b72 =\n\n4 2 2\n1\nF\u0303 M\u0303 \u2212 F\u0303 2 M\u0303 2 .\n3 K K 3 \u03c0 \u03c0\n\n(91)\n\nWe constrain the remainders in the ranges indicated in Table 5. Once the (MINUIT-powered)\nfit has converged, we can estimate a large body of quantities: NLO LECs, Nf = 2 chiral order\nparameters, values of the Kl3 scalar form factor at zero momentum transfer, at the Callan-Treiman\npoint and its soft kaon analog, test of the convergence of the series. We have propagated the errors exploiting the covariance matrix provided by MINOS, assuming that all uncertainties follow a\nGaussian distribution.\n\n6.2\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur results are summarised in Table 1. The first series of rows corresponds to the outcome of\nthe fit, whereas the lower rows are quantities derived from the results of the fit (LO LECs, NLO\nLECs, quantities in the Nf = 2 chiral limit, Kl3 quantities, relative fraction of LO/NLO/remainders\ncontributions at the minimum for several observables), and the last row is the \u03c72 per degree of\nfreedom.\nThe \"Subset\" fit of RBC/UKQCD results includes only a limited number of data points for\nthe masses and decay constants, which forces us to fix one of the parameters of the fit, namely the\nsimulated strange quark mass 3 and to impose some bounds on the size of the higher-order remainders,\nbased on a simple estimate from resonance saturation described in App. B. Indeed, some of these\nremainders are pushed to the limits of their range when the set of data is too small, because there\nis not enough information for MINUIT to choose a particular value for these remainders (keeping\nthem free would lead to a larger contribution from higher orders and to a further decrease of the\nleading-order contribution). The situation improves when higher masses and momenta are included\n(see the fits to \"Total\" sets presented in App. C), so that the remainders remain small, within the\nwindow discussed in App. B. It is interesting to notice that the results are consistent with the fits\n2 /M 2 \u2212 1 even\nto PACS-CS data (\"Subset\" or \"Total\"): r is close to 25 (i.e close to the ratio 2MK\n\u03c0\nthough its value was left free in our framework), the quark condensate remains around X(3) \u223c 0.5,\nthe squared decay constant is Z(3) \u223c 0.6, leading to a value for the LO term of the squared pion\nmass Y (3) \u223c 0.8.\nThe ratio of decay constants FK /F\u03c0 (left free in our fit) comes out slightly larger (smaller) for\nPACS-CS (RBC/UKQCD) than its Standard Model value eq.(34) in the fits of the masses and decay\nconstants. We obtain also values of simulated strange quark masses and of the physical strange\nquark mass in good agreement with the results obtained by the two collaborations (the discrepancy\nbetween RBC/UKQCD and PACS-CS is due to the different choice of renormalisation procedure,\nwhich explains the low value obtained by the PACS-CS collaboration [54]).\n3\n\nLetting all parameters free gives comparable results for the central values, but some parameters get very large\nuncertainties, larger than their allowed range. Propagating the errors in such a situation would be meaningless, and\nreporting the results of this fit would not provide much more information than the constrained fit that we present here.\n\n17\n\n\fr\nX(3)\nY (3)\nZ(3)\nFK /F\u03c0\nRem. at limit\nm\u0303s,ref /ms\nms (2 GeV)[MeV]\nm(2 GeV)[MeV]\nB0 (2 GeV)[GeV]\nF0 [MeV]\n\nPACS \u2212 CS Subset RBC/UKQCD Subset\nWithout Kl3\nWith Kl3\n26.5 \u00b1 2.3\n23.2 \u00b1 1.5\n0.59 \u00b1 0.21\n0.20 \u00b1 0.14\n0.90 \u00b1 0.22\n0.43 \u00b1 0.30\n0.66 \u00b1 0.09\n0.46 \u00b1 0.04\n1.237 \u00b1 0.025\n1.148 \u00b1 0.015\nnone\nd, e\n1.24 \u00b1 0.08\n1.15\u22c6\n70 \u00b1 4\n2.6 \u00b1 0.3\n3.34 \u00b1 1.18\n74.8 \u00b1 4.9\n\n107\n4.6 \u00b1 0.3\n0.92 \u00b1 0.67\n62.2 \u00b1 2.5\n\nX(2)\nY (2)\nZ(2)\nB(2 GeV)[GeV]\nF [MeV]\nl\u03043\nl\u03044\n\u03a3/\u03a30\nB/B0\nF/F0\n\n0.90 \u00b1 0.01\n1.04 \u00b1 0.02\n0.87 \u00b1 0.02\n3.83 \u00b1 0.50\n85.8 \u00b1 0.7\n5.0 \u00b1 2.1\n4.5 \u00b1 0.5\n1.51 \u00b1 0.51\n1.15 \u00b1 0.26\n1.15 \u00b1 0.08\n\n0.90 \u00b1 0.02\n1.00 \u00b1 0.03\n0.90 \u00b1 0.02\n2.09 \u00b1 0.19\n87.7 \u00b1 0.8\n\u22120.6 \u00b1 3.7\n3.3 \u00b1 0.5\n4.52 \u00b1 2.83\n2.28 \u00b1 1.39\n1.41 \u00b1 0.06\n\nf+ (0)\n\u2206CT * 103\n\u2206\u2032CT * 103\n\n1.004 \u00b1 0.149\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n0.985 \u00b1 0.008\n\u22120.2 \u00b1 12.1\n\u2212126 \u00b1 104\n\nF\u03c02\n2\nFK\n2\nF\u03c0 M\u03c02\n2 M2\nFK\nK\nF\u03c0 FK f+ (0)\n\n0.66 + 0.22 + 0.12\n0.44 + 0.48 + 0.08\n0.60 + 0.30 + 0.10\n0.42 + 0.50 + 0.08\n\u00d7\n\n0.45 + 0.69 \u2212 0.14\n0.34 + 0.76 \u2212 0.10\n0.20 + 0.95 \u2212 0.15\n0.14 + 0.97 \u2212 0.11\n0.40 + 0.75 \u2212 0.15\n\n0.9/3\n\n4.4/8\n\nL4 (\u03bc) * 103\nL5 (\u03bc) * 103\nL6 (\u03bc) * 103\nL8 (\u03bc) * 103\nL9 (\u03bc) * 103\n\n+\n\n2\nhr 2 iK\nV [fm ]\n0\n2\n2\nK\nhr iV [fm ]\n\n\u03c72 /N\n\n\u22120.1 \u00b1 0.2\n1.8 \u00b1 0.4\n0.1 \u00b1 0.4\n0.8 \u00b1 0.7\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n2.4 \u00b1 2.0\n1.8 \u00b1 1.6\n4.7 \u00b1 7.1\n4.4 \u00b1 7.1\n4.4 \u00b1 2.8\n\n0.248 \u00b1 0.156\n\u22120.027 \u00b1 0.106\n\nTable 1: Results of fits performed on the data from the PACS-CS [3] and RBC/UKQCD [4, 5, 6]\ncollaborations on pseudoscalar masses and decay constants, and Kl3 form factors in the case of\nRBC/UKQCD. In all cases, we considered only data with light pions (Subset) and only statistical\nerrors are shown. In the RBC/UKQCD case, we fixed the lattice strange quark mass (marked with\na star). The LECs are given at the scale \u03bc = m\u03c1 . In the PACS-CS case, the Kl3 form factor at zero\nmomentum transfer is a prediction of the fit (with an error combining those obtained from the fit and\nthe maximal contribution allowed for the remainder from dimensional estimation). The penultimate\nset of rows collects the relative fractions of LO/NLO/remainders for decay constants, masses and\nKl3 form factor at vanishing transfer momentum (for RBC/UKQCD) at the minimum.\n18\n\n\fThe decay constant in the Nf = 3 chiral limit is found to be rather low, in agreement with other\nrecent works [26, 42]. The pattern of Nf = 3 chiral symmetry breaking (with low quark condensate\nand decay constant) is reflected by the values obtained for the low-energy constants L4 and L6 ,\nwhich are both positive and do not show any sign of Zweig suppression. Such large values of L4\nand/or L6 have been obtained in several earlier works: dispersive analysis of scalar form factors [29],\ndispersive treatment of \u03c0K scattering [23], J/\u03c8 decay into a vector meson and two pseudoscalars [55]\n(with a value of L6 compatible with zero), preliminary NNLO Nf = 3 fits to pseudoscalar masses,\ndecay constants, Kl4 decay and \u03c0K scattering data [26]. . . Large values of L4 and L6 are known to\ninduce a significant dependence of the chiral order parameter on the strange quark mass, and it is\nnot surprising to witness a strong suppression from the Nf = 2 chiral limit to the Nf = 3 one. Let\nus notice that we obtain values for Nf = 2 chiral order parameters 4 which are in agreement with\nthe hypothesis of standard \u03c7PT confirming that this framework is indeed appropriate in the Nf = 2\nsector as shown by the recent data on Kl4 decays [20, 21], though this does not seem to be the case\nfor Nf = 3. The other LECs L5,8,9 have values in agreement with conventional estimates (this was\nexpected in particular for L9 since our framework induces modifications that are only sub-leading for\nvector quantities such as the pion electromagnetic form factor).\nLet us notice some specificities of our treatment of the chiral expansions. Tadpoles diagrams\ngenerate chiral logarithms of the form MP2 log(MP2 /\u03bc2 ) which can prove quite troublesome to fit. For\ninstance, the RBC/UKQCD collaboration [4, 5, 6] finds a better agreement of their data on decay\nconstants with polynomial fits than with chiral series. In our treatment, these chiral logarithms always\n\u25e6 2\n\ninvolve the leading-order mass M P . Therefore, the limit of a small Y (3) tames the chiral logarithms\nin our expansions, so that these logarithms become hard to distinguish from a polynomial at the\nnumerical level on the range of masses where \u03c7PT could be valid. Furthermore large contributions\nfrom NLO LECs, and in particular from L4 and L6 as just discussed, will enhance the quadratic\ndependence on the quark masses and thus our chiral expressions will mimic a polynomial dependence\non the quark masses that cannot be reproduced in the more usual treatment of chiral expansions.\nThese mechanisms could explain why chiral logarithms are often difficult to identify in lattice data,\nin addition to other effects (heavy strange quark mass, lattice systematics. . . ).\nThe Kl3 form factor at zero momentum transfer, f+ (0) = f0 (0), involves only LECs related to\ndecay constants and masses, eq. (63). In principle, it can be predicted from a fit of the latter quantities\nup to the determination of the remainder d+ . We quote the corresponding results in Table 1, where\nthe central value for f+ (0) corresponds to remainders set to zero. The uncertainty on this quantity\nincludes the maximal size allowed for the remainders d+ based on dimensional estimate (see Table 5),\nas well as the uncertainties coming from the parameters of the fit. Clearly, the NNLO remainder\nd+ hinders any accurate determination of f+ (0), unless their value is also precisely determined from\nthe fit, which is possible once data on Kl3 form factors themselves is included (Table 1). The values\nobtained for f0 (0) are somewhat larger than the Standard Model value eq.(76), as well as those\nobtained from the RBC/UKQCD collaboration using different forms for the extrapolation in quark\nmasses [5, 6]. This illustrates the importance of the mass extrapolation for lattice simulations at the\nlevel of accuracy aimed at currently. A particular attention was paid in ref. [6] to the structure of\nthe chiral expansion of f+ (0) = 1 + f2 + f4 , where f2 is the NLO contribution, which involves only a\ncombination of chiral logarithms divided by F02 :\n!#\n\"\n\u0012 2\u0013\nM\u03b72\nM\u03c0\n2x\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n,\nh(x) = 1 +\n(MK + M\u03c0 ) h\n+ (MK + M\u03b7 ) h\nlog x .\nf2 = \u2212\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 x2\n256\u03c0 2 F02\nMK\nMK\n(92)\nf2 is often said to be free from LECs and thus known precisely from Chiral Perturbation Theory.\n4\nThe expressions for the Nf = 2 order parameters X(2), Y (2), Z(2) can be obtained by setting m\u0303 = 0, m\u0303s = ms in\nthe expressions for F\u0303\u03c02 and F\u0303\u03c02 M\u0303\u03c02 , eqs. (78) and (81). The matching expressions for l\u03043,4 in terms of L4,5,6,8 differ from\nthe usual ones [2, 56] by factors of Y (2) and Y (3) that are easy to recover.\n\n19\n\n\fThis statement is not totally correct for the following reasons. One usually assumes that the value\nof F0 is close to that of F\u03c0 , so that it can be replaced in actual calculations by the physical value\nof the pion decay constant leading to the estimate f2 \u2243 \u22120.023. Since the difference between the\ntwo quantities is a higher-order effect, one can always perform this replacement. However, one has\nto determine how large the NNLO term f4 can be with such a prescription, and consequently how\nwell the chiral series for f+ converges. If F0 is significantly lower than F\u03c0 as indicated not only by\nour fit, but by other recent estimates [26, 42], the convergence is expected to be rather slow, forcing\nus to treat the NLO contribution to f+ (0) more carefully. We advocated that correlators of vector\nand axial currents yields observables with good convergence properties, selecting F\u03c0 FK f0 (0). In this\ncase, we should replace F02 by F\u03c0 FK in the evaluation of eq. (92), as can be checked in our expression\nfor f+ , eq. (63).\nOnce the Kl3 form factors are included in our fits, L9 can be determined even though the fit does\nnot constrain for this particular LEC tightly. In Table 1, the deviations from the Callan-Treiman\nrelation at t = \u2206K\u03c0 and its soft kaon analog at \u2212\u2206K\u03c0 are given. Their values are of the expected\nsize for SU (Nf ) chiral-symmetry breaking quantities for Nf = 2, 3 flavours respectively, and thus\ncompatible with the one obtained in standard \u03c7PT. The values of the square radii of the charged\nand neutral kaons, also shown have rather large uncertainties and are thus within the experimental\nerror bars.\nIn the last lines of our tables, we have indicated for each fit the contribution from LO, NLO\nand remainders to pseudoscalar decay constants and masses for values of the parameters at the\nminimum of the fit. We can see that the series converge well on overall (remainder much smaller\nthan LO+NLO), but that the LO term is far from saturating the series. The values of Y (3) obtained\nis smaller than 1, reducing the contribution from chiral logarithms compared to that from the NLO\nLECs. We can compare these results with those from a fit of the same observables, where the\nNLO and higher contributions (chiral logarithms \u03bcP , LECs Li , remainders) are computed replacing\n2mB0 , (m + ms )B0 and F0 by the physical pion and kaon masses and the pion decay constant. This\nis exactly equivalent to performing the same fit as before with the following replacements in the NLO\nand higher-order contributions:\nr\u21922\n\n2\nMK\n\u2212 1,\nM\u03c02\n\n\u03b7(r) \u2192 \u03b7(r0 ),\n\nq\u2192\n\nM\u0303\u03c02\n,\n2 \u2212 M\u0303 2\n2M\u0303K\n\u03c0\n\np\u2192\n\nr \u2212 r0\n,\n\u01eb(r) \u2192 \u01eb(r0 ) \u2212 2X(3) 2\nr0 \u2212 1\n\n2 \u2212 M\u0303 2\n2M\u0303K\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212 M2 ,\n2MK\n\u03c0\n\nY (3) \u2192 1,\n\n(93)\n\n\u25e62\n\nM2\nM\nlog 2P \u2192 log 2P ,\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n(94)\n\nboth for the observables that we consider, eqs. (78)-(84), and the equations allowing the determination of L4,5,6,8,9 , eqs. (25) and (39)-(42). For PACS-CS, this leads to \u03c72 /N = 1.1/3 (compared\nto our result 0.9/3), with very similar values for the fundamental parameters r, X(3), Y (3), Z(3).\nFor RBC/UKQCD, the fitting procedure yields \u03c72 /N = 9.5/8 (compared to our result 4.4/8), with\nmuch more uncertain values of the fundamental parameters (e.g., r = 14.9 \u00b1 12.1, X(3) = 0.30 \u00b1 0.26,\nY (3) = 0.68\u00b10.60). This is not particularly surprising since our fits to the PACS-CS data led to values\nof r and Y (3) in good agreement with eq. (93), but not the RBC/UKQCD ones. The corresponding\nconvergence of the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants is then (the relative contribution for\nLO, NLO and higher orders is given here):\nPACS \u2212 CS [NLO phys. masses]\nRBC/UKQCD [NLO phys. masses]\n\nF\u03c02\n2\nFK\nF\u03c02\n2\nFK\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n0.64 + 0.26 + 0.10,\n0.42 + 0.51 + 0.07\n0.45 + 0.70 \u2212 0.15\n0.34 + 0.76 \u2212 0.10,\n\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n2 M2\nFK\nK\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n2 M2\nFK\nK\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n0.67 + 0.24 + 0.09,\n0.50 + 0.44 + 0.06,\n0.31 + 0.81 \u2212 0.12,\n0.15 + 0.94 \u2212 0.11.\n\nThere is no saturation of the series by their leading order. We see that our formulae yields results\nthat are in good agreement with those obtained after reexpressing the NLO contributions in terms\n20\n\n\fof F\u03c0 , M\u03c0 , MK in the PACS-CS case, where Y (3) is close to 1. On the other hand, when Y (3) is not\nclose to 1 (for instance in the RBC/UKQCD case), our formulae provide more efficient and accurate\nfits (lower \u03c72 , smaller error bars). From a more methodological point of view, we avoid a perturbative\nreexpression of LECs in terms of F\u03c0 , M\u03c0 , MK in a regime where it is not justified.\nThese trends can be compared interestingly with the fits done by the lattice collaborations themselves, with a different treatment of the chiral series than ours. For instance, the MILC collaboration [9] observed from fits with staggered chiral perturbation theory that M\u03c02 received NNLO\ncorrections of the same size as NLO contributions, canceling each other to a large extent, with small\nNNNLO corrections (the latter being taken as analytic in quark masses and lattice spacings), whereas\nF\u03c0 exhibited no problems of convergence. On the other hand, the RBC/UKQCD collaboration [4]\nexperienced difficulties in fitting F\u03c0 both in Nf = 2 and Nf = 3 theories. They also noticed that\n2 and F using the N = 3 chiral expansion led to very significant NLO contributions (of\nfits to MK\nK\nf\norder 50%) when data up to the kaon mass scale was included, and they conclude that higher-order\ncorrections could be very significant (up to 30%).\nAt this point, we should emphasize that our framework does not contain any bias concerning the\nsize of X(3), Y (3) and Z(3) or on the relative size of the LO and NLO contributions. It is compatible\nwith the usual assumptions that chiral series of decay constants, squared masses. . . are saturated by\ntheir LO contribution, but it can also accommodate situations where there is a numerical competition\nbetween LO and NLO terms. It turns out that the lattice data set from the RBC/UKQCD and\nPACS-CS collaborations favour values for the three quantities X(3), Y (3), Z(3) smaller than 1, with\na \u03c72 /d.o.f. which ranges from fairly good to excellent. Our results confirm the difficulties reported\nby the two collaborations to fit Nf = 3 NLO chiral expressions, and highlights the improvement\nprovided by our Re\u03c7PT formulae for the extrapolations in quark masses of these quantities. As a\nfurther check, we have performed fits where we have taken that the physical masses (and not the LO\nones) in the unitarity functions J, K, L, M and the argument of the chiral logarithms (similarly to\nwhat was done in ref. [25]). The quality and parameters of the fits are almost unchanged, and the\noutcome for the derived quantities is also very similar, meaning that the relevant issue is the proper\nchoice of the \"good observables\" whose chiral series converge well.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nRecent lattice simulations with light 2+1 dynamical fermions have encountered difficulties to fit their\nresults for pseudoscalar masses, decay constants and form factors with chiral expansions obtained\nfrom Nf = 3 Chiral Perturbation Theory at next-to-leading order. Such fits of poor quality can\nbe related to the fact that chiral series are not saturated by their leading order, so that there is\na numerical competition between leading-order contributions \u2013 from the decay constant and/or the\ncondensate in the Nf = 3 chiral limit (mu = md = ms = 0) \u2013 and next-to-leading-order contributions\n\u2013 in particular from L4 and L6 , related to the Zweig-rule violation in the scalar sector, enhanced by\nms and not accurately known.\nIf there is such a competition, one must decide which observables are expected to have a good\noverall convergence (small higher-order contributions). According to the assumed equivalence of the\n\u03c7PT and QCD generating functionals at low energies, it seems reasonable to consider observables\nderived from correlators of axial and vector currents as well as pseudoscalar and scalar densities,\nas done here. For these observables, one must treat chiral series with a particular care, avoiding\nthe perturbative reexpression of LECs in terms of observables while neglecting higher orders (this\ncan be easily done by introducing remainders corresponding to NNLO and higher contributions) and\nchoosing how unitarity contributions should be treated to define the structure of the chiral expansion\nand its splitting into leading, next-to-leading and higher-order terms. Such a set of prescriptions was\nintroduced some time ago under the name of Resummed Chiral Perturbation Theory. In the present\npaper, we have recalled the basic ingredients of this framework and applied it to observables related\n21\n\n\fto pseudoscalar masses, decay constants, and kaon and pion form factors (electromagnetic and Kl3\nones). This allowed us to illustrate how O(p4 ) LECs L4,5,6,8,9 can be reexpressed in terms of the\nleading-order quantities X(3), Z(3), r as well as experimental values of observables (pion and kaon\ndecay constants and masses, square electromagnetic radius of the pion) and associated remainders.\nThen we have turned to 2+1 lattice simulations where these observables were obtained for several\nsets of quark masses: PACS-CS (decay constants and masses only) [3] and RBC/UKQCD (decay\nconstants, masses, Kl3 form factors) [4, 5, 6]. We performed fits to data corresponding only to light\nquark masses and small momenta, but checked the stability of our procedure by considering also fits\nto all data available (unitary points). Since only statistical uncertainties (without correlations) are\npublicly available for each of the points, we performed naive fits with Gaussian errors, in order to\ndetermine the leading-order parameters of the chiral Lagrangian as well as NNLO remainders and\nthe ratio of decay constants.\nThe fits are generally of a good quality, with a good consistency when one compares subsets\ncoming from the same collaboration. This allows one to determine the values of the LO quantities\nas well as the NNLO remainders, with a good accuracy in the case of PACS-CS, with a more limited\nprecision for RBC/UKQCD because of the restricted number of low-mass points. One observes that:\n\u2022 The decay constant and the quark condensate in the Nf = 3 limit (mu = md = ms = 0) are\nboth small and suppressed compared to the Nf = 2 case (mu = md = 0 and ms physical).\n\u2022 The low-energy constants L4 and L6 do not follow the Zweig rule suppression generally advocated to set them to zero.\n\u2022 The other low-energy constants L5 , L8 and L9 have values in good agreement with previous\nestimates.\n\u2022 The ratio of quark masses r remains quite close to the most simple estimate from pseudoscalar\nmasses.\n\u2022 Nf = 2 chiral order parameters are in good agreement with the values extracted from Kl4\ndecays.\n\u2022 When the sets of data are large enough, the NNLO remainders remain in the expected range\nfrom a naive dimensional estimate.\n\u2022 The expected numerical competition between LO and NLO chiral expansions indeed occurs for\n2 , F 2 M 2 and F 2 M 2 .\nF\u03c02 , FK\n\u03c0 \u03c0\nK K\nBeyond this description of the pattern of Nf = 3 chiral symmetry breaking and its implication\nfor the convergence of chiral expansions, we can also make a few predictions. The values obtained\nfor the kaon electromagnetic radii are in good agreement with experimental data. In the case of\nRBC/UKQCD, the value obtained for f+ (0) with our fits is slightly larger than the ones quoted by\nthe collaboration, relying on alternative formulae for the chiral expansion of the Kl3 form factors.\nThis has naturally an impact on the determination of |Vus |, considering the level of accuracy achieved\nin Kl3 decays [44].\nLattice simulations are able to investigate the dependence of observables on quark masses, which\nmakes them very valuable tools to investigate the chiral structure of QCD vacuum. Conversely,\nany improvement in our understanding of chiral symmetry breaking will help reducing systematics\nassociated with chiral extrapolations in lattice determinations. In light of the discussion presented in\nthis paper, it would be very helpful that more lattice collaborations present the dependence of their\nresults on the quark masses and/or study alternative ways of performing the extrapolation down\nto physical quark masses in order to assess the related systematics precisely. It would also be very\ninteresting to have lattice results for observables related to the scalar channel, and thus difficult to\n22\n\n\fdetermine from experiment. For instance, the pion and kaon scalar form factors, simulated on the\nlattice and analysed in the framework of Resummed Chiral Perturbation, would provide an interesting\ncomplement to the present discussion.\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank Damir Becirevic, Beno\u0131\u0302t Blossier, Andreas J\u00fcttner, Laurent Lellouch and\nChris Sachrajda for helpful discussions and comments on lattice simulations and Ulf-G.

The calculations\nare performed on two volumes, 163 \u00d7 32 and 243 \u00d7 64 ((2.74)3 fm3 ) (with a fifth dimension of length\n16), at each quark mass, except the lightest mass which is only simulated on the larger volume.\nThey performed a non-perturbative renormalisation to relate the lattice quark masses to those in the\nRI-MOM scheme.\nThe only points that we will use are those where the sea and valence quark masses are identical.\nThere are four sets corresponding to such a situation for pseudoscalar masses and decay constants\nin Ref. [4], corresponding to a(m\u0303lat \u2212 mres ) and a(m\u0303lat\ns \u2212 mres ) being respectively (0.005, 0.040),\n(0.010, 0.040), (0.020, 0.020), (0.030, 0.030). where amres = 0.00315(2). The quark masses are given\nin the RI-MOM scheme, but they can be related to the M \u0304S scheme through a multiplicative factor\nm\u0304(2 GeV) = Zm a\u22121 (am\u0303lat ) that drops in all the input quantities (which involve only ratio of quark\nmasses in the same setting).\nWe obtain the following values expressed in units of 10\u22123 GeV\u22122 for the pseudoscalar masses\nand decay constants [4, 57].

[4]. It turned out that the Nf = 3 chiral expansions led to rather poor fits\n(large \u03c72 per d.o.f), in particular for decay constants, unless they put stringent cuts on the values of\nquark masses where such expansions should hold. This led the authors in ref. [4] to perform fits to\nNf = 2 NLO chiral expansions. In addition, in ref. [14], NNLO SU (2) chiral expansions were shown\nto have only a limited utility to extrapolate the data: many more data points would be needed to\nfix the size of the combinations of O(p6 ) counterterms involved The results obtained in ref. [4] that\nare relevant for our discussion are summarised in table 2.\nIn addition, two different values for f+ (0) were obtained in refs. [5, 6] from the same gauge\nconfigurations, using either data for the scalar form factor or data for both form factors, and applying\na pole ansatz based on either Nf = 3 or Nf = 2 chiral perturbation theory for Kl3 form factors [7]:\nf+ (0) = 0.964 \u00b1 0.033 \u00b1 0.0034 \u00b1 0.0014 [5] ,\n\nA.2\n\nf+ (0) = 0.960(+5\n\u22126 ) [6] .\n\n(95)\n\nPACS-CS collaboration\n\nThe PACS-CS collaboration [3] has investigated the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants with a\nlarge sample of light quark masses, for one particular value of lattice spacing a\u22121 = 2.176(31) GeV, on\n24\n\n\fa 323 \u00d764 volume.

The values for the quantities in the Nf = 2 chiral limit\ncorrespond to Nf = 2 fits to the so-called Range I with finite-size effects included.\nThe values of the physical quark masses (m and ms ) and the lattice spacing are obtained by\nstudying the dependence of the mass of \u03c0, K and \u03a9 hadrons on these three parameters and tuning\nthem to reproduce the physical hadron masses.

Considering the uncertainty\nassociated with such a determination (in particular the role played by the form of the chiral extrapolation used for \u03c0 and K), we will not assume this value in our fit, but rather include this quantity\nas a parameter of our fit, and scale the other ratios involving a simulated strange quark mass over\nthe physical value.\n25\n\n\fFits to the Nf = 2 and Nf = 3 NLO chiral series for pseudoscalar masses and decay constants\nwere performed in ref. [3]. It turned out that the Nf = 3 chiral expansions led to rather poor fits,\nrelated to very significant NLO contributions compared to LO terms, in particular for the decay\nconstants, related to large contributions from kaon loops. In other words, the dependence of these\nquantities on the strange quark mass seen in these simulations is not accounted for properly by NLO\nSU (3) chiral perturbation theory. This led the authors in ref. [3] to perform fits to Nf = 2 chiral\nexpansions. The results obtained in ref. [3] that are relevant for our discussion are summarised in\ntable 3.\nA latter article of the same collaboration [54] considered simulations directly performed at the\nphysical point including non-perturbative renormalisation. This has induced a significant modification for the quark mass renormalisation factor, becoming Zm = 1.441(15) (non-perturbative) instead\nof Zm = 1.114 (one-loop perturbation theory) leading to an increase (decrease) in the values of quark\nmasses (condensates) by a factor 1.30. This should be taken into account when comparing the results\nobtained from the PACS and RBC/UKQCD sets in this article. The results obtained in ref. [54] that\nare relevant for our discussion are summarised in table 4. Since the simulation was performed at the\nphysical point, there is no further information on LECs describing the pattern of Nf = 2 and Nf = 3\nchiral symmetry breakings.\nr\n31.2 \u00b1 2.7\nFK /F\u03c0\n1.333 \u00b1 0.072\nms (2 GeV)[MeV] 92.75 \u00b1 0.58 \u00b1 0.95\nm(2 GeV)[MeV] 2.97 \u00b1 0.28 \u00b1 0.03\nTable 4: Results obtained by the CP-PACS collaboration [54] with non-perturbative renormalisation\nand simulation at the physical point.\n\nB\n\nDimensional estimate of the remainders\n\nAs indicated in eqs. (85)-(87), we can estimate the higher-order remainders assuming that they are\ndominated by NNLO contributions and using resonance saturation. A typical order of magnitude for\nO(m2s ) remainders so that the chiral series converge is 10% so that \u039bH \u2243 0.8 GeV. The corresponding\nsize \u03c3 of the remainders is given in table 5, and the remainders will be required to stay in the range\n[\u2212\u03c3, \u03c3] in our fits to lattice data if necessary. In the specific case of the electromagnetic square radius\nof the pion, we have combined the uncertainty on the experimental measurement of the square radius\nwith the theory uncertainty on the remainder in quadrature (the range for the kaon radii would be\nthe same).\nRemainder\nd, e, d+\nd\u2032 , e\u2032 , d\u2212\ne+\ne\u2212\neV\u03c0\n\n\u03c3\n0.148\n0.024\n0.005\n0.001\n0.318\n\nTable 5: Size of the NNLO remainders allowed in our fits, based on a dimensional estimate.\n\n26\n\n\fC\n\nFits with \"Total\" data sets\n\nIn Sec. 6.2, we considered fits to both PACS-CS and RBC/UKQCD data restricted to the low-mass\nand low-momentum region (\"Subset\" data). We have also performed fits to the whole sets of data\navailable (\"Total\" data), in order to test the stability of our results, and to illustrate the interest\nof having larger data sets to determine NNLO remainders in an accurate way. We are aware that\nsome of the data points considered here may stand outside the region of validity for Re\u03c7PT, but\nwe found nevertheless interesting to provide these results, showing a good consistency with those\nobtained with \"Subset\" data.\nOur results are summarised in Tables 6 and 7. The first series of rows corresponds to the outcome\nof the fit, whereas the lower rows are quantities derived from the results of the fit (LO LECs, NLO\nLECs, quantities in the Nf = 2 chiral limit, Kl3 quantities, relative fraction of LO/NLO/remainders\ncontributions at the minimum for several observables), and the last row is the \u03c72 per degree of\nfreedom. Most of the comments made in Sec. 6.2 can be restated, with a few changes in the case of\nthe RBC/UKQCD data (larger value of FK /F\u03c0 and lower value of f+ (0) than in the \"Subset\" case).\nWe notice that the fits are fairly good, and that all NNLO remainders turn out to lie within their\nexpected range.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
