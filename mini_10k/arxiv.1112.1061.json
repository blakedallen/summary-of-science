Gluon saturation at small-x (the longitudinal momentum fraction) in\nnucleon and nucleus plays a crucial role in the description of high energy hadronic scattering [1\u20133]. It has been applied to a wide range of processes which are relevant for the\ncurrent and future experiments at RHIC and LHC [4]. Among these physics, suppression of\nsingle inclusive hadron production in the forward direction of dAu collisions at RHIC has\nbeen regarded as one of the most important evidences for the on-set of gluon saturation at\nsmall-x in a large nucleus [5]. In particular, the dipole gluon distribution applied to hadron\nproduction in nucleon-nucleus scattering is the same as that in the description of inclusive\ndeep inelastic scattering structure function at small-x [6]. The duality between these two\nprocesses, and the universality of the gluon saturation is important to understand the strong\ninteraction dynamics in the dense medium [7].\nHowever, the experimental data are so far interpreted in the leading order calculation\nin the saturation formalism [8]. In order to solidate the above conclusion, we need to go\nbeyond the leading order Born approximation, and evaluate higher order corrections, which\nhas not yet been done. A next-to-leading order calculation is highly anticipated in the\nsmall-x formalism, to demonstrate the QCD factorization which can be applied to a wide\nrange of high energy processes. It has been one of the most important quests in the last\nfew years [9, 10]. Recent studies on the two-particle production in pA collisions have also\nemphasized the importance of the factorization and universality issues involved in the hard\nprocesses, in particular, for small-x physics [11].\nIn this paper, we will carry out, for the first time, a complete next-to-leading order\n(NLO) calculation for the single inclusive hadron production in pA collisions in the saturation regime, by employing both the collinear factorization and the high energy small-x\nfactorization techniques. Early efforts have been made in Refs. [12, 13]. Our results will\nnot only provide an important estimate of high order corrections, but also pave the way to\nbuild a QCD factorization for hard processes in the saturation formalism [9]. Moreover, this\ncalculation, combining with the associated calculations for inclusive DIS process [10], will\nhelp to identify the universality of the dipole gluon distributions in these processes. The\nmethod developed here will be very useful to other hard processes in small-x physics as well.\nIn the process of hadron production in pA collisions,\np+A\u2192h+X ,\n\n(1)\n\na parton from the nucleon (with momentum p) scatters on the nucleus target (with momentum PA ), and fragments into final state hadron with momentum Ph . In the dense medium\nof the large nucleus and at small-x, the multiple interaction become important, and we\nhave to perform the relevant resummation to make the reliable theoretical calculations. The\nsmall-x formalism, the color-glass-condensate or color-dipole formalism, was developed to\ncalculate these hard processes [4]. We are particularly interested in the scattering process\nwith a dilute projectile on a dense target such as the process of (1), where the parton from\nthe incoming nucleon can be treated as the normal parton distribution and it fragments to\nthe final state hadron after multiple interaction with the nucleus target. According to our\nfollowing calculations, the QCD factorization formalism for this process reads as,\nZ\nZ\nd3 \u03c3 p+A\u2192h+X X dz dx\nY\n=\n\u03bexfa (x, \u03bc)Dh/c (z, \u03bc) [dx\u22a5 ]Sa,c\n([x\u22a5 ])Ha\u2192c (\u03b1s , \u03be, [x\u22a5 ]\u03bc) , (2)\n2\n2\ndyd p\u22a5\nz\nx\na\n\u221a\nwhere \u03be = \u03c4 /xz with \u03c4 = p\u22a5 ey / s, y and p\u22a5 the rapidity and transverse momentum for the\nfinal state hadron and s the total center of mass energy square s = (p + PA )2 , respectively.\n2\n\n\fIn the above equation, fa (x) and Dh/c (z) represent the collinear parton distribution from\nthe incoming nucleon and fragmentation function for the final state hadron, where x is the\nmomentum fraction of the nucleon carried by the parton a, and z the momentum fraction\nof parton c carried by the final state hadron h, respectively. The response from the nucleus\nY\ntarget is denoted as Sa,c\n(x\u22a5 ) (see the definitions below), depending on the flavor of the\nincoming and outgoing partons and the gluon rapidity Y associated with the nucleus: Y \u2248\nln(1/xg ) with xg being momentum fraction of nucleus entering the hard process. At the\nleading order, they are defined as the two-point functions representing the dipole gluon\ndistribution functions in the elementary and adjoint representations for the quark and gluon\ninitialed subprocesses [4], respectively. Higher order corrections will have terms that depend\non the correlation functions beyond the simple two-point functions. Because of this reason,\nthe integral [dx\u22a5 ] represents all possible integrals at the particular order. For example,\na four-point function (non-linear term of dipole gluon distribution) will contribute to the\nquark channel at one-loop order. The hard factor Ha\u2192c describes the partonic scattering\namplitude of parton a into a parton c in the dense medium. This hard factor includes\nall order perturbative corrections, and can be calculated order by order. Although there\nis no simple k\u22a5 -factorization form beyond leading order formalism [14], we will find that\nin the coordinate space, the cross section can be written into a nice factorization form as\nEq. (2). Besides the explicit dependence on the variables shown in Eq. (2), there are implicit\ndependences on p\u22a5 [x\u22a5 ] in the hard coefficients as well.\n\u221a\nThe above factorization is derived in the high energy limit, i.e., s \u2192 \u221e, which is the\nsame limit that the dipole formalism was derived for the inclusive DIS structure function\nat small-x [15]. Two important variables are introduced to separate different factorizations\nfor the physics involved in this process: the collinear factorization scale \u03bc and the energy\nevolution rapidity dependence Y . The physics associated with \u03bc follows the normal collinear\nQCD factorization, whereas the rapidity factorization Y takes into account the small-x\nfactorization. The evolution respect to \u03bc is controlled by the usual DGLAP evolution,\nwhereas that for SaY by the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution [16, 17]. In particular,\nour one-loop calculations will demonstrate the important contribution from this rapidity\ndivergence.\nA different formula has been proposed in Ref. [12], where only part of one-loop calculations\nwere taken into account, and the rapidity divergence is not identified and the collinear\nevolution effects are not complete. In particular, the formula in Ref. [12] was expressed in\nthe leading order form, which does not allow higher order corrections. Recently, it has been\nrealized that the higher order corrections are important for high p\u22a5 particle production in pA\ncollisions, referred as \"inelastic\" contribution in Ref. [13]. In this paper, we will demonstrate\nthe factorization formula of Eq. (2), by a complete one-loop calculations, including not only\nthe contributions considered in Refs. [12, 13], but also the virtual diagrams which have\nnot yet been calculated before. We will take the example of quark channel contribution to\ndemonstrate this factorization, and list the results for all other channels in the end. For the\nquark channel contribution: qA \u2192 q + X, the above factorization formula can be explicitly\nwritten as\nd3 \u03c3 p+A\u2192h+X\n=\ndyd2p\u22a5\n\nZ\n\nZ 2\nh\ndz dx\nd x\u22a5 d2 y\u22a5 n (2)\n\u03b1s (1) i\n(0)\n\u03bexq(x,\n\u03bc)D\n(z,\n\u03bc)\nH\nS\n(x\n,\ny\n)\nH\n+\nh/q\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n2qq\nz2 x\n2\u03c0 2qq\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u001b\nZ 2\n\u03b1s (1)\nd b\u22a5 (4)\n+\n(3)\nS (x\u22a5 , b\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) H4qq ,\n(2\u03c0)2\n2\u03c0\n3\n\n\fup to one-loop order.

The above two funcG(k\u22a5 , k1\u22a5 ) =\n(2\u03c0)4\nR\ntions are related as follows: F (k\u22a5 ) = d2 k1\u22a5 G(k\u22a5 , k1\u22a5 ). At the leading order in \u03b1s , there is\nonly two-point function contribution. At the next-to-leading order, a non-linear term of the\ntwo-point functions will enter. For the gluon channel, a six-point function will apply. The\ngoal of this paper is to demonstrate the above factorization formalism, and obtain the hard\n(1)\ncoefficients H2,4 . In doing so, we calculate the scattering amplitude squared at one-loop order, and factorize out the divergences associated with the splittings of the quark distribution\nand fragmentation functions as well as the rapidity divergence from the two-point function.\nThe hard coefficients are Infra-red and Ultra-violet finite.\n2.

This can be seen from the large q\u22a5 behavior of the above integral and the identity\nrelating G and F . At large q\u22a5 limit, the gluonic interaction with nucleus target is not affected\nby the medium effect, and the Ward identity applies, therefore the UV divergence cancels\nout between the self-energy and vertex diagrams. The real gluon radiation diagrams have\nbeen considered before [11, 18]. In order to obtain the single inclusive particle production\ncross sections, we need to integrate out the phase space of the radiated gluon. In the high\nenergy limit, this integration will collapse the quadrupole into dipole and non-linear term\n4\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1.

At the end of the day, we can cast the real contribution into\n\u001a Z\nZ\nZ 1\n\u03b1s\ndz\n1 + \u03be2\nD(z)\nxq(x) CF d2 kg\u22a5 I(k\u22a5 , kg\u22a5 )\nd\u03be\n2\u03c0 2\nz2\n1\n\u2212\n\u03be\n\u03c4 /z\n\u001b\nZ\nNc\n2\n2\nd kg\u22a5 d kg1\u22a5 J (k\u22a5 , kg\u22a5 , kg1\u22a5 ) ,\n+\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere x = \u03c4 /z\u03be.\nThere are rapidity divergences in the above results (7,8) when \u03be \u2192 1. The rapidity\ndivergence appears when the longitudinal momentum of the gluon kg+ = (1 \u2212 \u03be)p+ goes\nto zero, namely when the rapidity of the gluon goes to \u2212\u221e. It is important to note that\nthe rapidity divergence cancels out for the term proportional to the color-factor CF . The\nremainder of the rapidity divergence is proportional to color-factor Nc /2, which is exactly\nthe same as that in the BK evolution equation [16, 17]. It is also interesting to note that the\nrapidity divergence disappears when one integrates over the transverse momentum k\u22a5 [19].\nThere are also collinear divergences from both real and virtual diagrams. We use dimensional regularization (D = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb) and follow the MS subtraction. Since the soft gluon\nradiation has been included into the BK evolution of the unintegrated gluon distribution,\nthere is no soft divergence. For example, for the virtual diagrams we have\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015 \u0012\n2\n1\nNc\nk\u22a5\n2\nCF F (k\u22a5 ) \u2212 + ln 2 + CF \u2212\nF (k\u22a5 ) ln(1 \u2212 \u03be)2\n4\u03c0\n\u01eb\n\u03bc\n2\n\u001b\nZ\n(kg1\u22a5 \u2212 \u03bek\u22a5 )2\nNc\n2\nd kg1\u22a5 G(k\u22a5 , kg1\u22a5 ) ln\n.\n(9)\n+\n2\n2\nk\u22a5\nThe collinear divergence is represented by 1/\u01eb in the above equation.

Obviously, Eq. (10) contains\n\nthree divergences: rapidity divergence, and two collinear divergences. The rapidity divergence (the first term) can be absorbed into the renormalization of the dipole gluon distribution [9, 10, 16, 17]. By doing so, we introduce the Y dependence in the two-point function,\nfrom which the BK evolution can be understood by identifying dY = d\u03be \u2032/(1 \u2212 \u03be \u2032 ). The\ncollinear divergences symboled by 1/\u01eb in dimensional regularization will be absorbed into\nthe renormalization of the quark distribution and fragmentation functions, following the\nusual collinear factorization.

The calculations for all other partonic\nchannels follow the same procedure, and the hard coefficients are calculated up to one-loop\norder.\nThe above results clearly demonstrate that the factorization of (3) is achieved. The\ncollinear divergences associated with the collinear parton distribution and fragmentation\nfunctions are factorized, and so does the rapidity divergence associated with the two-point\nfunction of the nucleus. This is a very important step to prove the factorization beyond the\nleading order in perturbation theory.\nOur results also show that we can write down the differential cross section in a factorization form in the coordinate space. The factorization scale dependence in the hard coefficients\nreflect the usual DGLAP evolutions for the quark distribution and fragmentation functions.\nIt is interesting to note that similar \u03bc dependence (associated with r\u22a5 ) has also been found\nin the transverse momentum resummation formalism derived for the Drell-Yan lepton pair\nproduction in Ref. [20]. However, the hard coefficients in our case do not contain double logarithms, and there is no need for the Sudakov resummation for inclusive hadron production\nin pA collisions.\nGreat simplification for the above hard coefficients can be found if we take large Nc limit.\nFor example, the last term of Eq. (11) will drop out. This applies to all other quark involved\n6\n\n\fchannels as well. Here, we list these hard coefficients in the large Nc limit,\n3\nc2\n(0,1)\n(0,1)\n(1)\nH2qg = H2gq = 0 , H2qq = \u2212 Nc \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03be)e\u2212ik\u22a5 *r\u22a5 ln 2 0 2 ,\n2\nr\u22a5 k \u22a5\n2\n1 + (1 \u2212 \u03be)\nx\u2212y\nb\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5\nk\u22a5\n(1)\n, k\u22a5 ) ,\nH4qg = \u22124\u03c0Nc\n2 *\n2 W(\n2\n\u03be\n\u03be\n(x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 ) (b\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 )\n\u03be 2 + (1 \u2212 \u03be)2 x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5\nb\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5\nk\u22a5\n(1)\n),\nH4gq = \u22124\u03c0\n2 *\n2 W(k\u22a5 ,\n\u03be\n\u03be\n(x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 ) (b\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 )\n\n(14)\n\nwhere W(k1\u22a5 , k2\u22a5 ) = e\u2212ik1\u22a5 *(x\u22a5 \u2212y\u22a5 )\u2212ik2\u22a5 *(y\u22a5 \u2212b\u22a5 ) , and we have chosen \u03bc = c0 /r\u22a5 for the factorization scale to further simplify the above expressions. The complete \u03bc dependence can be\nre-stored by using the DGLAP evolution for the relevant parton distributions and fragmentation functions. With the McLerran-Venugopalan model for the two-point function [3], we\nfind that the best choice for \u03bc will be in the order of the saturation scale Qs .

The quark loop contribution has been calculated but not included here.\nThe above results can be compared to the complete collinear factorization calculation\nfor inclusive hadron production at large transverse momentum. This corresponds to the\nsituation discussed in Ref. [13]. Another important issue is the running coupling effects (see\ne.g., Ref. [21]) at one-loop order, which has not been discussed in this paper. We will carry\nout these studies, together with the phenomenological applications to the RHIC and LHC\nexperiments, in a separate publication.\n3. Summary. We have demonstrated the QCD factorization for inclusive hadron production in pA collisions in the saturation formalism. The collinear divergences are shown to be\nfactorized into the splittings of the parton distribution from the incoming nucleon and the\nfragmentation function for the final state hadron. The rapidity divergence at one-loop order\nis factorized into the BK evolution for the dipole gluon distribution of the nucleus. The hard\ncoefficients are calculated up to one-loop order. In principle, using these hard coefficients\ntogether with the NLO parton distributions and fragmentation functions as well as the NLO\nsmall-x evolution equation[22, 23], one can obtain the complete NLO cross section of the\ninclusive hadron production in pA collisions.\nThese results are very important, not only for the phenomenological applications to the\ninclusive hadron production in pA collisions at RHIC and the LHC where active experiments\nare pursued for the study of saturation physics, but also for theoretically promoting the\nrigorous developments toward a complete QCD factorization in small-x physics [9]. Our\n7\n\n\fresults will stimulate further applications of the method, in particular, the factorization\ntechnique, used in this paper to other hard processes involving big nucleus and small-x gluon\ndistributions, as well as those in hot/dense medium. We expect more exciting developments\nalong this line.\nWe thank I. Balitsky, F. Dominguez, F. Gelis, J. Jalilian-Marian, C. Marquet, A. H.\nMueller, J.W. Qiu, A. Stasto, and R.
