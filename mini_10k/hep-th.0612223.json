The crucial simplifying aspect of the CP (N \u22121)\nmodel is that the gauge field is non-dynamical at the classical level, its dynamics being entirely\ngenerated by quantum corrections. The possibility of studying in a simpler setting some of the\nmost crucial aspects of gauge theories has been one of the main sources of interest in the model.\nThe phase structure of the CP (N \u22121) model, for example, was studied in [3], unveiling the\nexistence of two phases. In one of them the symmetry SU (N ) is broken down to SU (N \u2212 1),\nwhereas in the other the model remains SU (N ) symmetric and mass generation occurs for the\nfundamental bosonic fields. Afterwards, it was found [4] that the coupling to fermions preserves\nthe two phases structure but the long range force is hindered by the fermionic fields. More recently,\nthe supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model was studied both in the Wess-Zumino gauge [5] as well as using\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: alysson, lehum, ajsilva, ftfilho@fma.if.usp.br\n\n\f2\na manifestly supersymmetric covariant formulation [6].\nOn the other hand, in the past few years there have been a great deal of interest in quantum field\ntheories defined over a noncommutative spacetime [7]. Sources of this interest are, among others,\ntheir relations with string theory [8] and quantum gravity [9]. In particular, gauge theories defined\nin a noncommutative spacetime have been intensively studied, and several interesting effects were\nfound, such as UV/IR mixing [10, 11] and strong restrictions of gauge groups and couplings to the\nmatter [12, 13, 14]. The gauge invariance of the quantum corrections to the effective action also\nbecomes very non-trivial in the noncommutative setting [15, 16].\nNoncommutative gauge theories present a rich spectrum of phenomena, yet they can be also\nvery complicated to deal with. So it was natural to investigate a simpler model with gauge invariance, such as the CP (N \u22121) model. When extending this model to the noncommutative spacetime,\none finds more than one possibility of coupling the Lagrange multiplier and the gauge fields to the\nbasic bosonic fields. In the non-supersymmetric case, the so-called fundamental and adjoint representations were considered in [17], using an 1/N expansion. In the fundamental representation, the\nmodel turned out to be renormalizable and free of dangerous infrared UV/IR singularities. However, in the adjoint representation, the appearance of non-integrable UV/IR divergences presented\nitself as an obstacle to the consistency of the model in higher orders of the 1/N expansion.\nIt is now well known that supersymmetry helps in avoiding the UV/IR problem in noncommutative field theories [18, 19, 20]. Indeed, a supersymmetric extension of the noncommutative CP (N \u22121)\nmodel in the adjoint representation was studied in [21], showing that the aforementioned problem\nis not present. However, in that case, when the noncommutativity of the space is withdrawn the\nmodel does not return to the commutative supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) , but to a free scalar theory,\nwhere the basic scalar field does not satisfy a constraint nor is coupled to an auxiliary gauge field.\nIn the present work we are going to analyze the supersymmetric noncommutative CP (N \u22121)\nmodel in the fundamental representation, i.e., the case where the commutative limit really goes\nto the usual commutative supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model. We shall study the phase structure of\nthe model and the issue of the UV/IR mixing in the Feynman integrals, aiming at establishing its\nrenormalizability at the leading order in the 1/N expansion. We will also look at the subleading\ncorrections to the two-point vertex function of the scalar superfield, and show how the use of an\nexplicitly supersymmetric quantization scheme avoids some difficulties with the usual (component)\napproach.\nOther aspects of the noncommutative supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model in the fundamental representation were also focused in the recent literature. The structure of BPS and non-BPS solitons\n\n\f3\nwas first found to be quite similar to the commutative model [22, 23, 24, 25], but then novel\nsolutions with no commutative counterparts were found [26]. This raised questions about the\nequivalence between the CP 1 and the nonlinear sigma model in the noncommutative case [27].\nAlternatives to the above investigations, employing the Seiberg-Witten map, can be found in [28]\nand [29]. More recently, the dynamics of the CP (N \u22121) model in a non-anticommutative spacetime\nhas also been investigated [30, 31].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the model in superfield formulation\nand study its phase structure. Leading order corrections to the effective action of the auxiliary\nand gauge superfields are calculated in Section III, and the renormalizability of the model at the\nleading order is discussed in Section IV. In Section V, the quadratic effective action of the scalar\nsuperfield is discussed at the subleading order. Finally, Section VI contains our conclusions and\nfinal remarks. In the Appendix, we explicitly give the component formulation of the superfield\nmodel studied by us.\n\nII.\n\nTHE NONCOMMUTATIVE SUPERSYMMETRIC CP (N \u22121) MODEL\n\nThe bosonic CP (N \u22121) model, in commutative spacetime, when the matter field is in the fundamental representation, is defined by the action [3]\nZ\n\u0010\nn\nN \u0011o\n,\nS=\nd3 x D \u03bc \u03c6a D\u03bc \u03c6a + \u03c3 \u03c6a \u03c6\u0304a \u2212\ng0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6a is an N-uple of scalar fields and \u03c3 is a scalar Lagrange multiplier which enforces the\nconstraint \u03c6\u03c6\u0304 = N/g0 . The covariant derivative is D \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc , A\u03bc being an auxiliary vector\n\u2194\n\ngauge field, which classically is the composite field A\u03bc = i\u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u0304/2\u03c6\u03c6\u0304. The spacetime index \u03bc runs\nover 0, 1, 2, and we use the metric g \u03bc\u03bd = (\u2212, +, +).\nThe model defined by (1) can be generalized to a noncommutative spacetime where coordinates\nsatisfy\n[x\u03bc , x\u03bd ] = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\nby substituting into (1) the usual product of functions by the \u2217-Moyal product [32]. The divergence\n\nstructure of the noncommutative CP (N \u22121) model has been extensively discussed in [17, 21]. Here\nwe shall focus on a noncommutative supersymmetric extension of the model (1) which, adopting\nthe conventions of [33], is given by\nZ\nn 1\n\u0010\nN \u0011o\n.\nS=\u2212\nd5 z\n\u2207\u03b1 \u03a6a \u2217 \u2207\u03b1 \u03a6a + \u03a3 \u2217 \u03a6a \u2217 \u03a6\u0304a \u2212\n2\ng0\n\n(3)\n\n\f4\nIn this expression, z = (x\u03bc , \u03b8 \u03b1 ), where x\u03bc with \u03bc = 0, 1, 2 and \u03b8 \u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1, 2 are, respectively, the\nbosonic and the grassmanian superspace coordinates, \u03a6a is an N-uple of scalar superfields, \u03a3 is a\nscalar Lagrange multiplier superfield, and A\u03b1 is a two-component spinor auxiliary gauge superfield.\nThe supercovariant spinorial derivative is given by \u2207\u03b1 = D\u03b1 \u2212 iA\u03b1 , where D\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b1 + i\u03b8 \u03b2 \u2202\u03b2\u03b1 . We\nremark that the \u2217-Moyal product in (3) is defined by [36]\nf (x, \u03b8) \u2217 g(x, \u03b8) = exp\n\n\u0010i\n\n2\n\n\u0398\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2202 \u2202 \u0011\nf (x, \u03b8)g(y, \u03b8)|x=y ,\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\n\n(4)\n\naffecting only the bosonic coordinates x\u03bc , which are noncommutative, whereas the grassmanian\ncoordinates satisfy the usual anticommutativity rule {\u03b8 a , \u03b8 b } = 0 [46]. To avoid troubles with\nunitarity, we shall restrict the noncommutativity to the spatial bosonic coordinates, what amounts\nto consider \u03980i = 0 [37] [47].\nThe action above is U(N) globally invariant and U(1) gauge invariant. The infinitesimal gauge\ntransformations are given by,\n\u03a6a \u2192 \u03a6\u2032a = (1 + iK) \u2217 \u03a6a ,\n\u03a6\u0304a \u2192 \u03a6\u0304\u2032a = \u03a6\u0304a \u2217 (1 \u2212 iK) ,\n\n(5)\n\nA\u03b1 \u2192 A\u2032\u03b1 = A\u03b1 + D\u03b1 K + i[K, A\u03b1 ]\u2217 ,\n\u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u2032 = \u03a3 + i[K, \u03a3]\u2217 ,\nwhere K is a real scalar superfield. The ordering of \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0304 in the constraint term in Eq. (3)\nimplies in the need of \u03a3 being transformed under the gauge transformation in order to maintain\nthe invariance of the action (observe that the transformation of \u03a3 disappears when we take the\ncommutative limit \u0398 \u2192 0, as it should). Had we chosen the opposite order for \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0304, then \u03a3\n\nwould not need to transform, but a mixing between the fields \u03a3 and Aa would appear already in\nleading 1/N approximation (we will return to this point later).\nBy writting the original (unrenormalized) superfields in terms of renormalized ones through the\n1/2\n\ndefinitions, \u03a6 = Z1 \u03a6R , A\u03b1 = Z3 A\u03b1R , and \u03a3 = Z2 \u03a3R , the action gets written as,\nnZ\n\u0010\nN\u0011\n1 \u03b1\nd5 z\nD \u03a6\u0304Ra D\u03b1 \u03a6Ra + Z2 \u03a3 Z1 \u03a6Ra \u03a6\u0304Ra \u2212\n2\ng0\n\u0011 1\no\niZ1 Z3 \u0010\n\u2212\nD\u03b1 \u03a6\u0304Ra AR\u03b1 \u03a6Ra + \u03a6\u0304Ra ARa D \u03b1 \u03a6Ra + Z1 Z32 \u03a6\u0304Ra A2R \u03a6Ra .\n2\n2\n\nS = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(6)\n\nIn this equation and in the remaining of this paper, we will not explicitly indicate the \u2217-Moyal\nproduct, which should be understood to be present when multiplying fields in configuration space.\n\n\f5\nWave functions and coupling constant counterterms are defined through\nZ1 = 1 + \u03b4\u03a6 ,\nZ1 Z3 = (1 + \u03b4\u03a6 )(1 + \u03b4A ) = 1 + \u03b4e ,\nZ1 Z32 = (1 + \u03b4\u03a6 )(1 + \u03b4A )2 = 1 + \u03b4b ,\nZ1 Z2 = (1 + \u03b4\u03a6 )(1 + \u03b4\u03a3 ) = 1 + \u03b4c ,\nZ2 /go = \u03bc/g + \u03b4g ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bc is an arbitrary parameter with dimension of mass and g is the adimensional renormalized\ncoupling constant.

The first gap\nequation is represented graphically in Fig. 1. These equations are the same as the corresponding\nones for the supersymmetric commutative model [5]. The dependence on \u0398 of the underlying\nnoncommutativity of the spacetime, manifested through the phase factors appearing in the vertices,\ndisappear due to the vanishing of the momentum entering through the external leg of \u03a3 or \u03a6N . In\nparticular, this fact ensures that UV/IR infrared singularities do not appear in the gap equation.\nThe scalar integral in (13) can be performed using dimensional reduction [42], leading to\ni\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\n\nd3 k\n1\n|m|\n=\n3\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) k + m\n4\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\n\f7\nhence the counterterm \u03b4g turns out to be finite, providing an arbitrary finite renormalization of\nthe gap equation, which now reads,\n|m| \u03bc\n+ + \u03b4g \u2212 vv\u0304 = 0 ,\n4\u03c0\ng\nmv\u0304 = mv = 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nOne convenient choice for the counterterm is \u03b4g = \u2212\u03bc/4\u03c0, where \u03bc > 0 is the same mass scale\nintroduced in (7), so that the solution of the first of Eqs. (15) can be written as\n\u03bc\n\ng=\n\nv\u0304v +\n\n\u03bc\u2212|m|\n4\u03c0\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nFrom the second of Eqs. (15) we see that the model presents two phases,\n1. A broken U(N) phase in which \u03a6N has a vacuum expectation value h\u03a6N i = N 1/2 v 6= 0 and\nthe fields \u03a6 remain massless (m = 0). This happens for\ng=\n\n4\u03c0\n< 4\u03c0 .\n(1 + 4\u03c0v\u0304v/\u03bc)\n\n(17)\n\n2. A symmetric phase in which \u03a6 has an induced mass m 6= 0 but h\u03a6i = 0. This happens for\ng=\n\n4\u03c0\n> 4\u03c0 .\n1 \u2212 |m/\u03bc|\n\n(18)\n\nFrom Eq. (18) one can immediately calculate the \u03b2 function in the symmetric phase,\n\u03b2(g) \u2261 \u03bc\n\n\u0010\ndg\n|m/\u03bc|\ng \u0011\n.\n= 4\u03c0\n=\ng\n1\n\u2212\nd\u03bc\n(1 \u2212 |m/\u03bc|)2\n4\u03c0\n\n(19)\n\nAs can be read from this formula, \u03b2 goes to zero for \u03bc \u2192 \u221e, characterizing an ultraviolet fixed point\nat g = 4\u03c0. This result is the same as the one for the corresponding commutative model [5]. The\nsame analysis for the behavior of the \u03b2 function in the broken phase leads to similar conclusions.\nWe stress that the choice \u03b4g = \u2212\u03bc/4\u03c0 is convenient, but not essential. Any value of \u03b4g provided\nthat \u03b4g < 0 leads to the same phase structure, only the value of the critical g changes. If \u03b4g > 0,\non the other hand, the symmetric phase does not exist, while for \u03b4g = 0, the model does not\nhave the broken phase. Finally, one could choose other regularization to calculate the divergent\nintegral in Eq. (14), in which case it could be necessary the counterterm \u03b4g to contain an infinite\nrenormalization to render the gap equation (13) finite. Even in this case, the above considerations\nwould apply without any changes.\n\n\f8\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE PROPAGATORS AT LEADING ORDER\n\nAs we are mainly interested in studying the renormalization of the model and the two phases\nhave the same ultraviolet behavior [43] we will work in the symmetric phase from now on, so that\nthe action reads\n\u0012\n\nN\u03bc\nS =\nd z \u03a6\u0304a (D \u2212 m)\u03a6a \u2212 \u03a3 \u03a6a \u03a6\u0304a \u2212\ng\no\n\u0003\n\u0002\ni \u03b1\n+\n+ SCT ,\nD \u03a6\u0304a A\u03b1 \u03a6a + \u03a6\u0304a A\u03b1 D \u03b1 \u03a6a\n2\nZ\n\n5\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03a6\u0304a A\u03b1 A\u03b1 \u03a6a\n2\n\nwhere g is related to m and \u03bc by Eq.

(11). This fact\nsimplifies the perturbative calculations in the next subsections.\n\nA.\n\nThe two point effective action of the \u03a3 Field\n\nAs we read from the Eq. (20), classically the \u03a3 field is purely a constraint field without dynamics.\nHowever, in leading order of 1/N it acquires a (nonlocal) kinetic term becoming a propagating field.\nIn this approximation, the radiative corrections to its two point effective action (see Fig. 2) is given\nby\n(2)\n\u0393\u03a3\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd3 p 2\nd \u03b8 \u03a3(\u2212p, \u03b8) N f (p)(D 2 + 2m) \u03a3(p, \u03b8) .\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(22)\n\nThe exponential factors in the two vertices cancel between themselves and the result is similar to\nthe commutative one. The nonlocal character of this action is explicit in the factor f (p),\nZ\n1\nd3 k\nf (p) =\n3\n2\n(2\u03c0) [(k + p) + m2 ](k2 + m2 )\n! \uf8f1\nr\n\uf8f2 \u22121/8|p| for p \u2192 \u221e\n1\n1 p2\n=\n= \u2212 p arctg\n.\n\uf8f3 \u22121/8\u03c0m for p \u2192 0\n2 m2\n4\u03c0 p2\n\n(23)\n\n(2)\n\nThe finiteness of \u0393\u03a3 is consistent with the absence of a \u03a32 counterterm in the original action.\nFrom Eq. (22), we arrive at the following \u03a3 propagator,\nhT \u03a3(p, \u03b81 )\u03a3(\u2212p, \u03b82 )i =\n\ni (D 2 \u2212 2m)\n\u03b412 ,\nN f (p)(p2 + 4m2 )\n\n(24)\n\n\f9\nwhich is regular in the infrared (p2 \u2192 0) while decreasing as 1/p in the ultraviolet limit (p2 \u2192 \u221e).\nSince, by definition, the \u03a3 effective propagator is minus the inverse of the kernel in Eq. (22),\nin the supergraph formalism we still have the identity represented graphically in Fig. 3, which\nis known to hold in the usual commutative CP (N \u22121) model [3]. This powerfull identity is very\nimportant in the study of subleading quantum corrections to the vertex functions of the model, as\nwe will comment in Section V.\n\nB.\n\nThe two point effective action of the spinorial gauge potential\n\nAnother field whose dynamics is generated only at the quantum level is the spinorial superfield\nA\u03b1 .

One frequent choice in the literature is\nthe Wess Zumino gauge, which amounts to choosing the components \u03c7\u03b1 and B of the superpotential\nA\u03b1 (see Eq.

(20), we see that an 1/N order process mixing A\u03b1 and \u03a3 is in principle\npossible, what would result in a mixed propagator. The graph contributing to this process is\nrepresented in Fig. 5 and the corresponding Feynman amplitude,\nZ\n(2)\n\u0393A\u03a3 = h T : \u2212i d5 z \u03a3(z)\u03a6a (z)\u03a6\u0304a (z) :\nZ\nh\ni\ni\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n5 \u2032 i\n\u00d7:\nD \u03a6\u0304b (z )A\u03b1 (z )\u03a6b (z ) + \u03a6\u0304b (z )A\u03b1 (z )D \u03a6b (z ) : i ,\nd z\n2!\n2\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\ncan be separated in two terms, \u0393A\u03a3 = \u0393A\u03a3,1 + \u0393A\u03a3,2 , the first one giving\nZ\nZ\nd3 k\nN\nd3 p 2\n(k\u03b2\u03b1 \u2212 mC \u03b2\u03b1 )\n(2)\nd\n\u03b8\nD\u03b2 A\u03b1 (\u2212p, \u03b8)\u03a3(p, \u03b8) ,\n\u0393A\u03a3,1 = i\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u01eb (2\u03c0) [(k + p) + m ](k + m )\n(2)\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nwhile, for the second term, we found \u0393A\u03a3,2 = \u2212\u0393A\u03a3,1 , so that the would be \u0393A\u03a3 vanishes. Essential\nto this result was the choice of the order of the fields \u03a3\u03a6a \u03a6\u0304a , instead of \u03a3\u03a6\u0304a \u03a6a , in the action in\nEq. (20). This choice, nevertheless, requires \u03a3 to change under gauge transformations, to keep\nthe action gauge invariant, as we pointed out earlier. Clearly, one could choose the \u03a3\u03a6\u0304\u03a6 order to\nkeep \u03a3 gauge invariant, but then the Moyal phase factors in the two vertices in Eq. (38) would\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nnot compensate each other and, as a consequence, \u0393A\u03a3,1 and \u0393A\u03a3,2 would not cancel. In this\nway, a mixed term A\u03a3 would be generated in the effective action, making highly cumbersome the\nevaluation of propagators and quantum corrections.\n\nIV.\n\nRENORMALIZABILITY OF THE MODEL\n\nLet us now investigate the renormalizability of the model at the leading 1/N order. The power\ncounting for the supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model, in the fundamental representation, is the same\nas in the adjoint representation that was studied in [21], so we just quote the result. The superficial\ndegree of divergence of a given supergraph is\n\u03c9 = 2\u2212\n\n1\n(E\u03a6 + EA + ND ) \u2212 E\u03a3 \u2212 Ec ,\n2\n\n(40)\n\n\f12\nwhere Ei is the number of external legs of the field i, and ND is the number of covariant derivatives\nacting on the external legs. We remark that, in order to have an iso-scalar contribution to the\neffective action, these variables are subjected to the constraints that E\u03a6 and the sum EA + ND are\neven numbers.\nFrom Eq. (40) we see that, apart from vacuum diagrams, the most divergent quantum corrections to the effective action are linearly ultraviolet divergent, and these can be dangerous to the\nrenormalizability of the model since they can generate non-integrable (linear) infrared UV/IR singularities. It is essential to secure that linear UV/IR singularities do not appear since they would\ninvalidate the 1/N expansion at higher orders [10]. Some of the graphs with \u03c9 = 1 have already\nbeen analyzed and shown not to generate dangerous linear divergences: the ones corresponding to\nthe spinorial superfield effective action (EA = 2), calculated in Section III B, and the graph with\nE\u03a3 = 1, which has been taken into account in the gap equations. The only remaining contributions with \u03c9 = 1 is the one with (EA , ND ) = (1, 1), which vanishes; in fact, it is proportional to\n\u0001\nR 2\nd \u03b81 D \u03b1 D 2 + 2m \u03b411 = 0. Since there is no corresponding counterterm in SCT , the finiteness\n\nof this contribution is essential to the renormalizability of the model.\n\nNow, we focus on graphs with logarithmic power counting. These generate integrable, and\ntherefore harmless, UV/IR infrared singularities. However, some of these graphs are still dangerous\nbecause they can generate ultraviolet divergent contributions to the effective action which do\nnot have corresponding counterterms in SCT . Listing all possible graphs with \u03c9 = 0, one finds\nseveral such potentially dangerous corrections. The contribution with E\u03a3 = 2 has been already\nanalyzed and found to be finite in Section III A, whereas the one with (EA , ND , E\u03a3 ) = (1, 1, 1)\n(the A\u03a3 mixing) yields a vanishing result, as shown in Section III C. It still remains some harmful\npossibilities, namely for EA = 4, E\u03a6 = 4, (EA , E\u03a3 ) = (2, 1), and (EA , ND ) = (3, 1). However,\nafter checking that the phase factor induced by the Moyal product is planar in all these cases, one\ncan argue that the logarithmically divergent parts of the Feynman integrals will be proportional\nR\n\u03b1\u03b2\nto \u01eb d3 k (kk 2 )2 , which vanishes due to the symmetric integration in the loop momentum.\n\nAs for the remaining logarithmically divergent supergraphs, they correspond to terms present\n\nin the counterterm action and are, therefore, in principle renormalizable. An explicit verification\nof the renormalizability of the supersymmetric noncommutative CP (N \u22121) model would involve the\ncalculation of the subleading corrections to several vertex functions, and one example of such a\ncalculation is presented in the next section.\n\n\f13\nSUBLEADING CORRECTIONS TO THE \u03a6\u0304\u03a6 EFFECTIVE ACTION\n\nV.\n\nLet us calculate in detail the subleading contributions to the quadratic effective action of the \u03a6\nsuperfield, which arise from the diagrams depicted in Fig. 6. Here the calculations become quite\ninvolved, and part of them were performed with the help of a symbolic computer program designed\nfor superfield calculations [45].

(46); additionally, \u03936 is finite in the gauge \u03be = \u22121. The important point we want\nto stress is that we were able to renormalize this vertex function in an explicitly supersymmetric\nfashion, which is not the case if one works in the Wess-Zumino gauge [5], when the bosonic and\nfermionic components of the superfield \u03a6 receives different wave function renormalizations.\nAs for the other logarithmically divergent contributions, their calculation is much more complicated, involving graphs with one and two loops of momentum. A complete evaluation of such\nsubleading contributions is out of the scope of this work, but in such a calculation the graphical\nidentity represented in Fig. 3 would be essential to secure the cancellation of several UV divergences. Indeed, in the usual (commutative, nonsupersymmetric) CP (N \u22121) model, the proof of\nrenormalizability at arbitrary order of the 1/N expansion heavily relies on such identity [3].\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we studied the noncommutative supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model in 2+1 spacetime\ndimensions, when the basic field is in the fundamental representation. We found that the model has\nthe same phase structure as its commutative counterpart. Differently from the previous analysis\nin [21], in this case the model classically goes, in the \u0398 \u2192 0 limit, to the usual (commutative)\n\nsupersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model. At the quantum level, the UV/IR mixing generates only mild\ninfrared singularities, so that renormalizability at the leading 1/N order is explicitly checked.\nThe use of the superspace approach ensures a manifestly supersymmetric renormalization, which\nis not necessarily the case in the components fields formalism. In [5], where the ultraviolet behavior\nof the commutative supersymmetric CP (N \u22121) model was considered, the scalar and fermionic\nsuperpartners received different renormalizations, so that the supersymmetric invariance of the\nquantum theory becomes non-manifest. This problem does not appear in the superfield formalism.\nWe have also studied the first subleading correction to the effective action of the \u03a6 field, and\nshown that it can be made finite by only a wave function renormalization, as it should. Such\nexplicit calculations have not appeared in the literature so far, even in the commutative case.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the Brazilian agencies Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do\nEstado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico\n(CNPq), and Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u0131\u0301vel Superior (CAPES).

One can realize that the first line corresponds to the bosonic\nmodel of Eq. (1), extended to the noncommutative spacetime, but we now have the additional\nfermionic degrees of freedom, necessary for supersymmetry, and a new constraint imposed by the\ncombination \u03b6 + i\u03bb, and \u03ba is a composite field classically given by \u03ba = \u2212\u03c8a \u03c8\u0304a /2\u03c6a \u03c6\u0304a . Elimination\nof \u03ba in Eq. (A6) yields a four-fermion self-interaction, typical of the supersymmetric extension of\nthe CP (N \u22121) model [4].\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] D'Adda A, Luscher M and Di Vecchia P 1978 Nucl. Phys.

Recently, this idea has also been extended\nto three-dimensional spacetime [35]\n[47] It is interesting to remember that unitarity violations are a peculiar aspect of the approach for noncommutative field theories we are considering. There are alternative proposals which do not suffer from\nthis issue, see [9, 38, 39, 40]\n[48] We shall not consider possible quantum phases that could arise from classical noncommutative solitonic\nsolutions, which can be singular at small \u0398 [41].\n\n\f"}
