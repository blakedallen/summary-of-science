We say that p contains q as a pattern if there exists\na subsequence 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < * * * < ik \u2264 n so that for all indices j and r, the\ninequality qj < qr holds if and only if the inequality pij < pir holds. If p\ndoes not contain q, then we say that p avoids q. In other words, p contains\nq if p has a subsequence of entries, not necessarily in consecutive positions,\nwhich relate to each other the same way as the entries of q do.\nIn a recent survey paper [2] on the monotone permutation pattern 12 * * * k,\nwe have shown that if Xn is the random variable counting copies of that\npattern in a randomly selected permutation of length n, then as n goes to\ninfinity, Xn converges (in distribution) to a normal distribution. When we\nsay \"random permutation\", we mean that each permutation of length n is\nselected with probability 1/n!.\nIn this paper, we will generalize that result for any permutation pattern\nq, and the variable Xn,q counting the copies of q in permutations of length\n\u2217\n\nPartially supported by an NSA Young Investigator Award.\n\n1\n\n\fn. The proof is very similar to the monotone case; just some details have\nto be modified. The result is a far-reaching generalization of the classic\nresults (see [3]) for more references) that descents and inversions of random\npermutations are asymptotically normal. As a byproduct, we will see how\nclose Var(Xn,q ) and Var(Xn,12***k ) are to each other, for any pattern q of\nlength k.\n\n2\n\nThe Proof of Our Theorem\n\n2.1\n\nBackground and Definitions\n\nWe need to introduce some notationpfor transforms of the random variable\nZ. Let Z\u0304 = Z \u2212 E(Z), let Z\u0303 = Z\u0304/ Var(Z), and let Zn \u2192 N (0, 1) mean\nthat Zn converges in distribution to the standard normal variable.\nDefinition 1 Let {Yn,k |k = 1, 2, * * * , Nn } be an array of random variables.\nWe say that a graph G is a dependency graph for {Yn,k |k = 1, 2 * * * , Nn } if\nthe following two conditions are satisfied:\n1. There exists a bijection between the random variables Yn,k and the\nvertices of G, and\n2. If V1 and V2 are two disjoint sets of vertices of G so that no edge of G\nhas one endpoint in V1 and another one in V2 , then the corresponding\nsets of random variables are independent.\nNote that the dependency graph of a family of variables is not unique.\nIndeed if G is a dependency graph for a family and G is not a complete\ngraph, then we can get other dependency graphs for the family by simply\nadding new edges to G.\nNow we are in position to state Janson's theorem, the famous Janson\ndependency criterion.\nTheorem 1 [4] Let Yn,k be an array of random variables such that for all\nn, and for all k = 1, 2, * * * , Nn , the inequality |Yn,k | \u2264 An holds for some\nreal number An , and that the maximum degree of a dependency graph of\n{Yn,k |k = 1, 2, * * * , Nn } is \u2206n .\nP n\n2\nSet Yn = N\nk=1 Yn,k and \u03c3n = Var(Yn ). If there is a natural number m\nso that\n\u0012 \u0013m\nm\u22121 An\n\u2192 0,\n(1)\nNn \u2206 n\n\u03c3n\n2\n\n\fas n goes to infinity, then\n\u1ef8n \u2192 N (0, 1).\n\n2.2\n\nVerifying the Conditions of Janson's Criterion\n\nLet q be a fixed pattern of length k. As q is fixed for the rest of this paper,\nwe will mark our variables Xn instead of Xn,q , in order to avoid excessive\nindexing.\n\u0001\nLet us order the nk subwords of length\nk of the permutation p1 p2 * * * pn\n\u0001\nlinearly in some way. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 nk , let Xn,i be the indicator random\nvariable of the event that in a randomly selected permutation of length n,\nthe ith subword of length k in the permutation p = p1 p2 * * * pn is a q-pattern.\nWe will now verify that the family of the Xn,i satisfies all conditions of the\nJanson Dependency Criterion.\nFirst, |Xn,i | \u2264 1 for all i and all n, since the Xn,i\u0001 are indicator random\nvariables. So we can set An = 1. Second, Nn = nk , the total number of\nsubwords of length k in p. Third, if a 6= b, then Xa and Xb are independent\nunless the corresponding subwords intersect. For that, the bth subword\nmust intersect the ath subword in j entries, for some 1 \u2264 P\nj \u2264 k \u2212\u00011. For\na\nk\u22121 k n\u2212k\u0001\nfixed ath subword, the number of ways that can happen is j=1\n=\nj k\u2212j\nn\u2212k\u0001\nn\u0001\n\u2212\n1,\nwhere\nwe\nused\nthe\nwell-known\nVandermonde\nidentity\nto\n\u2212\nk\nk\ncompute the sum. Therefore,\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nn\nn\u2212k\n\u2206n \u2264\n\u2212\n\u2212 1.\n(2)\nk\nk\nIn particular, note that (2) provides an upper bound for \u2206n in terms of a\npolynomial function of n that is of degree k \u2212 1 since terms of degree k will\ncancel.\nThere remains the task of finding a lower bound for \u03c3n that we can\nP(nk)\nthen use in applying Theorem 1. Let Xn = i=1\nXn,i . We will show the\nfollowing.\nProposition 1 There exists a positive constant c so that for all n, the inequality\nVar(Xn ) \u2265 cn2k\u22121\nholds.\n\n3\n\n\fProof: By linearity of expectation, we have\nVar(Xn ) = E(Xn2 ) \u2212 (E(Xn ))2\n\uf8f62 \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8eb n\n\uf8f6\uf8f62\n\uf8eb\uf8eb n\n(\n)\n(\n)\nk\nk\n\uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8ecX\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ecX\nXn,i \uf8f8 \uf8f8 \u2212 \uf8edE \uf8ed\nXn,i \uf8f8\uf8f8\n= E \uf8ed\uf8ed\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\n\uf8f62 \uf8f6 \uf8eb n\n\uf8eb\uf8eb n\n\uf8f62\n(\n)\n(\n)\nk\nk\n\uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8ecX\n\uf8ec\uf8ecX\n\uf8f7\nXn,i \uf8f8 \uf8f8 \u2212 \uf8ed\n= E \uf8ed\uf8ed\nE(Xn,i )\uf8f8\nX\n\n(3)\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nE(Xn,i1 Xn,i2 ) \u2212\n\nX\n\nE(Xn,i1 )E(Xn,i2 ).\n\n(6)\n\ni1 ,i2\n\ni1 ,i2\n\nLet I1 (resp.

Clearly, it suffices to show that\nX\nX\nE(Xn,i1 )E(Xn,i2 ) \u2265 cn2k\u22121 ,\n(7)\nE(Xn,i1 Xn,i2 ) \u2212\ni1 ,i2\n\n|I1 \u2229I2 |\u22641\n\nsince the left-hand side of (7) is obtained from the (6) by removing the sum of\nsome positive terms, that is, the sum of all E(Xn,i1 Xn,i2 ) where |I1 \u2229I2 | > 1.\nAs E(Xn,i ) = 1/k! for each i, the sum with negative sign in (6) is\nX\n\nE(Xn,i1 )E(Xn,i2 ) =\n\ni1 ,i2\n\n\u0012 \u00132\n1\nn\n* 2,\nk\nk!\n\nwhich is a polynomial function in n, of degree 2k and of leading coefficient\n1\nk!4 . As far as the summands in (6) with a positive sign go, most of them\nare also equal to k!12 . More precisely, E(Xn,i1 Xn,i2 ) = k!12 when I1 and I2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nare disjoint, and that happens for nk n\u2212k\nordered pairs (i1 , i2 ) of indices.\nk\nThe sum of these summands is\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nn n\u2212k 1\n,\n(8)\ndn =\nk!2\nk\nk\nwhich is again a polynomial function in n, of degree 2k and with leading\ncoefficient k!14 . So summands of degree 2k will cancel out in (6). (We will\nsee in the next paragraph that the summands we have not yet considered\nadd up to a polynomial of degree 2k \u2212 1.)\n\n4\n\n\fIn fact, considering the two types of summands we studied in (6) and\n(8), we see that they add up to\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nk\u0001\n2k\u22121\u0001\nn\n1\nn n\u2212k 1\n2k\u22121 2 2 \u2212\n2\n\u2212\n= n\n+ O(n2k\u22122 ) (9)\nk k!2\nk!2\nk!4\nk\nk\n\u2212k2\n= n2k\u22121 4 + O(n2k\u22122 ).\n(10)\nk!\nNext we look at ordered pairs of indices (i1 , i2 ) so that the corresponding\nsubwords I1 and I2 intersect in exactly one entry, the entry x. Let us restrict\nour attention to the special case when I1 and I2 both form q-patterns, and\nx is the ath smallest entry in I1 and the bth smallest entry in I2 . Given\nq, the pair (a, b) describes the location of x in I1 and in I2 as well. Let I1\u2032\n(resp. I2\u2032 ) denote the set of a \u2212 1 positions in I1 (resp. b \u2212 1 positions in I2 )\nwhich must contain entries smaller than x given that I1 (resp. I2 ) forms a\nq-pattern. Similarly, let I1\u2032\u2032 (resp. I2\u2032\u2032 ) denote the set of k \u2212 a positions in\nI1 (resp. k \u2212 b positions I2 ) which must contain entries larger than x given\nthat I1 (resp. I2 ) forms a q-pattern.\nExample 1 Let q = 35142, and let us say that I1 and I2 both form qpatterns, and they intersect in one entry x that is the third smallest entry\nin I1 and the fourth smallest entry in I2 (so a = 3, and b = 4). Then x is\nthe leftmost entry of I1 and the next-to-last entry of I2 . Furthermore, the\nthird and fifth positions of I1 form I1\u2032 and the second and fourth positions of\nI1 form I1\u2032\u2032 . Similarly, the first, third, and fifth positions of I2 form I2\u2032 and\nthe second position of I2 forms I2\u2032\u2032 .\nLet qa (resp. qb ) be the pattern obtained from q by removing its ath\nsmallest (resp. bth smallest) entry.\nNote that Xi1 Xi2 = 1 if and only if all of the following independent\nevents hold.\n1. In the (2k \u2212 1)-element set of entries that belong to I1 \u222a I2 , the entry x\nis the (a + b \u2212 1)th smallest. This happens with probability 1/(2k \u2212 1).\n2. The a + b \u2212 2 entries in positions belonging to I1\u2032 \u222a I2\u2032 must all be\nsmaller than the 2k \u2212 a \u2212 b entries in positions belonging to I1\u2032\u2032 \u222a I2\u2032\u2032 .\n1\n.\nThis happens with probability 2k\u22122\n(a+b\u22122)\n3.\n\n\u2022 the subword I1\u2032 is a pattern that is isomorphic to the pattern\nformed by the a \u2212 1 smallest entries of q,\n5\n\n\f\u2022 the subword I2\u2032 is a pattern that is isomorphic to the pattern\nformed by the b \u2212 1 smallest entries of q,\n\u2022 the subword I1\u2032\u2032 is a pattern that is isomorphic to the pattern\nformed by the k \u2212 a largest entries of q, and\n\u2022 the subword I2\u2032\u2032 is a pattern that is isomorphic to the pattern\nformed by the k \u2212 b largest entries of q. This happens with prob1\nability (a\u22121)!(b\u22121)!(k\u2212a)!(k\u2212b)!\n.\nTherefore, if |I1 \u2229 I2 | = 1, then\nP (Xi1 Xi2 = 1) =\n\n1\n\n(11)\n(a \u2212 1)!(b \u2212 1)!(k \u2212 a)!(k \u2212 b)!\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1\na + b \u2212 2 2k \u2212 a \u2212 b\n=\n*\n.\n(12)\na\u22121\n(2k \u2212 1)!\nk\u2212a\nn \u0001\nHow many such ordered pairs (I1 , I2 ) are there?

So we have proved the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 2 Let q be a fixed permutation pattern of length k, and let Xn be\nthe random variable counting occurrences of q in permutations of length n.\nThen X\u0303n \u2192 N (0, 1). In other words, Xn is asymptotically normal.\nThe following Corollary shows how close the variances of the numbers of\ncopies of two given patterns are to each other.\nCorollary 1 For any pattern q of length k, we have\nV ar(Xn,q ) = ck n2k\u22121 + O(n2k\u22122 ),\nwhere\n1\nck =\n(2k \u2212 1)!2\n\nX \u0012a + b \u2212 2\u00132 \u00122k \u2212 a \u2212 b\u00132\nk2\n\u2212 4.\nk!\na\u22121\nk\u2212a\n\n1\u2264a,b\u2264k\n\nWe point out that this does not mean that V ar(Xn,q ) does not depend on\nq. It does, and it is easy to verify that Var(X4,123 ) 6= Var(X4,132 ). However,\nit is only the terms of degree at most 2k \u2212 2 of Var(Xn,q ) that depend on q.\nProof: Note that in the proof of Theorem 2, we have not used anything\nabout the pattern q apart from its length. Our claim then follows from\ncomparing (10) and (14). \u2738\n\nReferences\n[1] M. B\u00f3na, Generalized Descents and Normality, submitted.\n[2] M.
