This is known as Serre's problem on projective modules. It\nwas affirmatively proved by D. Quillen and A. Suslin independently in 1976. Now it is\nknown as the Quillen-Suslin Theorem. Quillen established the following Local-Global\nPrinciple in his proof of Serre's problem in [12].\nQuillen's Local-Global Principle: A finitely presented module over a polynomial ring R[X] over a commutative ring R is extended if and only if it is locally\nextended over the localization of R[X] at every maximal ideal of R.\nWe shall be concerned with the matrix theoretic version of this theorem. It was\nestablished by Suslin in his second proof of the Serre's problem in [13].\n\n1\n\n\fSuslin's Local-Global Principle: Let R be a commutative ring with identity\nand let \u03b1(X) \u2208 GLn (R[X]) with \u03b1(0) = In . If \u03b1m (X) \u2208 En (Rm [X]), for every\nmaximal ideal m \u2208 Max(R), then \u03b1(X) \u2208 En (R[X]).\nShortly after his proof of Serre's problem, Suslin-Kopeiko in [14] established an\nanalogue of the Local-Global Pinciple for the elementary subgroup of the orthogonal\ngroup. Around the same time V.I. Kopeiko proved the analogous result for the elementary subgroup of the symplectic group. In this note we establish an analogous\nLocal-Global Principle for the elementary transvection subgroup of the automorphism\ngroup of projective, symplectic and orthogonal modules of global rank at least 1 and\nlocal rank at least 3. All previous work on this topic assumed that the global rank\nis at least 3. By definition the global rank or simply rank of a finitely generated\nprojective R-module (resp. symplectic or orthogonal R-module) is the largest integer\nr\n\nr\n\nr such that \u2295R (resp. \u22a5 H(R)) is a direct summand (resp. orthogonal summand) of\nthe module. H(R) denotes the hyperbolic plane.\nUsing this Principle one can generalize well known facts regarding the group\nn\nGLn (R) (Sp2n (R) or O2n (R)) of automorphisms of the free module \u2295R of rank n\nn\n\n(free hyperbolic module \u22a5 H(R) of rank n) to the automorphism group of finitely\ngenerated projective (symplectic or orthogonal) modules of global rank at least 1 and\nsatisfying the local condition mentioned above. Specifically, we shall show that the\nelementary transvection subgroup is normal and the full automorphism group modulo\nits elementary transvection subgroup is nilpotent-by-abelian whenever stable dimension is finite. These generalize results by Suslin and Kopeiko in [10], [13], [14], Taddei\nin [15], first author in [1], Vavilov and Hazrat in [9], and others. We treat the above\nthree groups uniformly.\nOur main results are as follows:\nLet Q denote a projective, symplectic or orthogonal module of global rank \u2265 1\nand satisfying the local conditions stated above. Let\nG(Q) = the automorphism group of Q,\nT(Q) = the subgroup generated by transvections, and\nET(Q) = the subgroup generated by elementary transvections.\nTheorem 1. Let R be a commutative ring with identity and let \u03b1(X) \u2208 G(Q[X]),\nwith \u03b1(0) = In . If \u03b1m (X) \u2208 ET(Qm [X]), for every maximal ideal m \u2208 Max(R), then\n\u03b1(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]).\nTheorem 2. T(Q) = ET(Q). Hence ET(Q) is a normal subgroup of G(Q).\nBy applying Local-Global Principle (Theorem 1) we prove\nG(Q)\nTheorem 3. The factor group ET(Q)\nis nilpotent-by-abealian, when the stable\ndimension (i.e. Bass-Serre dimension) is finite.\n\nTo prove the result we use the ideas of first author in [1], where he has shown\nthat the group GLn (R)/En (R) is nilpotent-by-abelian for n \u2265 3, but we avoid the\nfunctorial construction of the descending central series.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nDefinition 2.1 Let R be an associative ring with identity. The following condition\nwas introduced by H. Bass:\n(Rm ) for every (a1 , . . . , am+1 ) \u2208 Umm+1 (R), there are {xi }(1\u2264i\u2264m) \u2208 R such that\n(a1 + am+1 x1 )R + * * * + (am + am+1 xm )R = R.\nThe condition (Rm ) \u21d2 (Rm+1 ) for every m > 0. Moreover, for any n \u2265 m + 1 the\ncondition (Rm ) implies (Rn ) with xi = 0 for i \u2265 m + 1.\nBy stable range for an associative ring R we mean the least n such that (Rn )\nholds. The integer n \u2212 1 is called the stable dimension of R and is denoted by\nsdim(R).\nLemma 2.2 (cf .[2]) If R is a commutative noetherian ring with identity of Krull\ndimension d, then sdim(R) \u2264 d.\nDefinition\n2.3 A row vector (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 Rn is said to be unimodular in R if\nPn\ni=1 Rai = R. The set of unimodular vectors of length n in R is denoted by Umn (R).\nFor an ideal I, Umn (R, I) will denote the set of those unimodular vectors which are\n(1, 0, . . . , 0) modulo I.\nDefinition 2.4 Let M be a finitely generated left module over a ring R. An element\nm in M is said to be unimodular in M if Rm \u223c\n= R and Rm is a direct summand of\nM , i.e. if there exists a finitely generated R-submodule M \u2032 such that M \u223c\n= Rm \u2295 M \u2032 .\nDefinition 2.5 For an element m \u2208 M , one can attach an ideal, called the order\nideal of m in M , viz. OM (m) = {f (m)|f \u2208 M \u2217 = Hom(M, R)}. Clearly, m is\nunimodular if and only if Rm = R and OM (m) = R.\nDefinition 2.6 Following H. Bass ([2], pg. 167) we define a transvection of a finitely\ngenerated left R-module as follows: Let M be a finitely generated left R-module. Let\nq \u2208 M and \u03c6 \u2208 M \u2217 with \u03c6(q) = 0 . An automorphism of M of the form 1 + \u03c6q\n(defined by \u03c6q (p) = \u03c6(p)q, for p \u2208 M ), will be called a transvection of M if either\nq \u2208 Um(M ) or \u03c6 \u2208 Um(M \u2217 ). We denote by Trans(M ) the subgroup of Aut(M )\ngenerated by transvections of M .\nDefinition 2.7 Let M be a finitely generated left R-module. The automorphisms of\nthe form (p, a) 7\u2192 (p + ax, a) and (p, a) 7\u2192 (p, a + \u03c8(p)), where x \u2208 M and \u03c8 \u2208 M \u2217 ,\nare called elementary transvections of M \u2295 R. (It is easily verified that these\nautomorphisms are transvections.) The subgroup of Trans(M \u2295 R) generated by the\nelementary transvections is denoted by ETrans(M \u2295 R).\nDefinition 2.8 Let R be an associative ring with identity. To define other classical\nmodules, we need an involutive antihomomorphism (involution, in short) \u2217 : R \u2192 R\n(i.e., (x \u2212 y)\u2217 = x\u2217 \u2212 y \u2217 , (xy)\u2217 = y \u2217 x\u2217 and (x\u2217 )\u2217 = x, for any x, y \u2208 R). We\nassume that 1\u2217 = 1. For any left R-module M the involution induces a left module\nstructure to the right R-module M \u2217 = Hom(M, R) given by (xf )v = (f v)x\u2217 , where\nv \u2208 M , x \u2208 R and f \u2208 M \u2217 . Any right R module can be viewed as a left R-module\nvia the convention ma = a\u2217 m for m \u2208 M and a \u2208 R. Hence if M is a left Rmodule, then OM (m) has a left R-module structure with scalar multiplication given\nby \u03bbf (m) = f (\u03bbm).\n3\n\n\fBlanket Assumption: Let A be an R-algebra, where R is a commutative ring with\nidentity, such that A is finite as a left R-module. Let A possesses an involution\nt\n\u2217 : r 7\u2192\n\u0012 r\u0304, for\u0013r \u2208 A. For a matrix M = (mij ) over A we\n\u0012 define\n\u0013 M = (mij ) . Let\n0 1\n0 1\n\u03c81 =\n, \u03c8n = \u03c8n\u22121 \u22a5 \u03c81 for n > 1; and \u03c8e1 =\n, \u03c8en = \u03c8en\u22121 \u22a5 \u03c8e1 ,\n\u22121 0\n1 0\nfor n > 1. For a column vector v \u2208 An we write ve = v\u0304 t \u03c8n in the symplectic case and\nfn in the orthogonal case. We define a form h , i as follows:\nv = v\u0304 t \u03c8\ne\n(\nv t * w in the linear case\nhv, wi =\nve * w otherwise.\n\n(Viewing M as a right A-module we can assume the linearity).\nSince R is commutative, we can assume that the involution \"\u2217\" defined on A is\ntrivial over R. We shall always assume that 2 is invertible in the ring R while dealing\nwith the symplectic and the orthogonal cases.\nDefinition 2.9 A symplectic (orthogonal) A-module is a pair (P, h , i), where P\nis a projective left A-module of even rank and h , i : P \u00d7 P \u2192 A is a non-singular (i.e.\nP \u223c\n= P \u2217 by x 7\u2192 hx, *i) alternating (symmetric) bilinear form).\n\nDefinition 2.10 Let (P1 , h , i1 ) and (P2 , h , i2 ) be two symplectic (orthogonal) left\nA-modules. Their orthogonal sum is the pair (P, h , i), where P = P1 \u2295 P2 and\nthe inner product is defined by h(p1 , p2 ), (q1 , q2 )i = hp1 , q1 i1 + hp2 , q2 i2 . Since this\nform is also non-singular we shall henceforth denote (P, h , i) by P1 \u22a5 P2 and called\nthe orthogonal sum of (P1 , h , i1 ) and (P2 , h , i2 ) (if h , i1 and h , i2 are clear from the\ncontext).\nDefinition 2.11 For a projective left A-module P of rank n, we define H(P ) of global\nrank rank n supported by P \u2295 P \u2217 , with form h(p, f ), (p\u2032 , f \u2032 )i = f (p\u2032 ) \u2212 f \u2032 (p) for the\nsymplectic modules and f (p\u2032 ) + f \u2032 (p) for the orthogonal modules. There is a unique\nnon-singular alternating (symmetric) bilinear form h , i on the A-module H(A) =\nA \u2295 A\u2217 (up to scalar multiplication by A\u2217 ) namely h(a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 )i = a1 b2 \u2212 a2 b1 in\nthe symplectic case and a1 b2 + a2 b1 in the orthogonal case.\nRemark 2.12 A bilinear form h , i induces a homomorphism \u03a8 : P \u2192 P \u2217 =\nHom(P, A), defined by \u03a8(p)(q) = hp, qi. The converse is also true since 2 is invertible in A. If h , i is symmetric, then one has \u03a8 = \u03a8\u2217 , and if h , i is alternating,\nthen one has \u03a8 + \u03a8\u2217 = 0, under the canonical isomorphism P \u223c\n= P \u2217\u2217 .\nDefinition 2.13 An isometry of a symplectic (orthogonal) module (P, h , i) is an\nautomorphism of P which fixes the bilinear form. The group of isometries of (P, h , i)\nis denoted by Sp(P ) for the symplectic modules and O(P ) for the orthogonal modules.\nDefinition 2.14 Following Bass ([3]) we define a symplectic transvection as follows:\nLet \u03a8 : P \u2192 P \u2217 be an induced isomorphism. Let \u03b1 : A \u2192 P be a A-linear map\ndefined by \u03b1(1) = u. Then \u03b1\u2217 \u03a8 \u2208 P \u2217 is defined by \u03b1\u2217 \u03a8(p) = hu, pi. Let v \u2208 P be\nsuch that \u03b1\u2217 \u03a8(v) = hu, vi = 0. An automorphism \u03c3(u,v) of (P, h , i) of the form\n\u03c3(u,v) (p) = p + hu, piv + hv, piu + hu, piu\n4\n\n\ffor u, v \u2208 P with hu, vi = 0 will be called a symplectic transvection of (P, h , i) if\neither v \u2208 Um(P ) or \u03b1\u2217 \u03a8 \u2208 Um(P \u2217 ). (Viewing P as a right A-module we can assume\nthe linearity).\n\u22121\nSince h\u03c3(u,v) (p1 ), \u03c3(u,v) (p2 )i = hp1 , p2 i, \u03c3(u,v) \u2208 Sp(P, h , i). Note that \u03c3(u,v)\n(p) =\np \u2212 hu, piv \u2212 hv, piu \u2212 hu, piu.\nThe subgroup of Sp(P, h , i) generated by the symplectic transvections is denoted\nby TransSp (P ).\n\nDefinition 2.15 The (symplectic) transvections of (P \u22a5 A2 ) of the form (p, b, a) 7\u2192\n(p + aq, b \u2212 hp, qi + a, a) and (p, b, a) 7\u2192 (p + bq, b, a + hp, qi \u2212 b), where a, b \u2208 A\nand p, q \u2208 P , are called elementary symplectic transvections. The subgroup of\nTransSp (P \u22a5 A2 ) generated by the elementary symplectic transvections is denoted by\nETransSp (P \u22a5 A2 ).\nIn a similar manner we can define a transvection \u03c4(u,v) for an orthogonal module\n(P, h, i). For this we need to assume that u, v \u2208 P are isotropic, i.e. hu, ui = hv, vi = 0.\nDefinition 2.16 An automorphism \u03c4(u,v) of (P, h , i) of the form\n\u03c4(u,v) (p) = p \u2212 hu, piv + hv, piu\nfor u, v \u2208 P with hu, vi = 0 will be called an isotropic (orthogonal) transvection\nof (P, h , i) if either v \u2208 Um(P ) or \u03b1\u2217 \u03a8 \u2208 Um(P \u2217 ), (see [8], pg. 214).\n\u22121\nOne checks that \u03c4(u,v) \u2208 O(P, h , i) and \u03c4(u,v)\n(p) = p + hu, piv \u2212 hv, piu.\nThe subgroup of O(P, h , i) generated by the isotropic orthogonal transvections is\ndenoted by TransO (P ).\nDefinition 2.17 The isotropic orthogonal transvections of (P \u22a5 A2 ) of the form\n(p, b, a) 7\u2192 (p \u2212 aq, b + hp, qi, a) and (p, b, a) 7\u2192 (p \u2212 bq, b, a \u2212 hp, qi), where a, b \u2208 A\nand p, q \u2208 P , are called elementary orthogonal transvections. The subgroup\nof TransO (P \u22a5 A2 ) generated by elementary orthogonal transvections is denoted by\nETransO (P \u22a5 A2 ).\nNotation 2.18 In the sequel P will denote either a finitely generated projective left\nA-module of rank n, a symplectic left A-module or an orthogonal left A-module of\neven rank n = 2r with a fixed form h , i. And Q will denote P \u2295 A in the linear case,\nand P \u22a5 A2 , otherwise. To denote (P \u2295 A)[X] in the linear case and (P \u22a5 A2 )[X],\notherwise, we will use the notation Q[X]. We assume that the rank of projective\nmodule n \u2265 2, when dealing with the linear case, and n \u2265 6, when considering the\nsymplectic and the orthogonal cases. For a finitely generated projective A-module\nM we use the notation G(M ) to denote Aut(M ), Sp(M, h , i) and O(M, h , i) respectively; S(M ) to denote SL(M ), Sp(M, h , i) and SO(M, h , i) respectively; T(M ) to\ndenote Trans(M ), TransSp (M ) and TransO (M ) respectively; and ET(M ) to denote\nETrans(M ), ETransSp (M ) and ETransO (M ) respectively.\nThe reader should be able to easily verify that if R is a reduced ring and P a free\nR-module, i.e. if P = Rr (in the symplectic and the orthogonal cases we assume that\nP is free with the standard bilinear form), then ETrans(P ) \u2283 Er (R), ETransSp(P ) \u2283\nESp(R) and ETransO (P ) \u2283 EOr (R), for r \u2265 3, in the linear case, and for r \u2265 6, in\nthe symplectic (and orthogonal) case.\nEquality in all these cases will follow from Lemma 2.20 below.\n5\n\n\fWe shall assume\n(H1) for every maximal ideal m of A, the symplectic (orthogonal) module\nQm is isomorphic to A2n+2\nwith the standard bilinear form H(An+1\nm\nm ).\n(H2) for every non-nilpotent s \u2208 A, if the projective module Qs is free\nAs -module, then the symplectic (orthogonal) module Qs is isomorphic to\nA2n+2\nwith the standard bilinear form H(An+1\n).\ns\ns\nRemark 2.19 Note that T(P ) is a normal subgroup of G(P ). Indeed, for \u03b1 \u2208 G(P )\nin the linear case we have \u03b1(1 + \u03c6q )\u03b1\u22121 = 1 + (\u03c6\u03b1\u22121 )\u03b1(q) . In the symplectic case we\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncan write \u03c3(u,v) = 1 + \u03c3(u,v)\nand similarly, \u03b1(1 + \u03c3(u,v)\n)\u03b1\u22121 = 1 + (\u03c3 \u2032 \u03b1\u22121 )(\u03c3\u2032 (u),\u03c3\u2032 (v)) .\nSimilar argument will also holds for the orthogonal case.\nLemma 2.20 If the projective module P is free of finite rank n is free (in the symplectic and the orthogonal cases we assume that the projective module is free with\nthe standard bilinear form), then Trans(P ) = En (R), TransSp (P ) = ESpn (R) and\nTransO (P ) = EOn (R) for n \u2265 3 in the linear case and for n \u2265 6 otherwise.\nProof. In the linear case, for p \u2208 P and \u03c6 \u2208 P \u2217 if P = Rn then \u03c6p : Rn \u2192 R \u2192 Rn .\nHence 1 + \u03c6p = In + v.wt for some row vector v and column vector w in Rn . Since\n\u03c6(p) = 0, it follows that hv, wi = 0. Since either v or w is unimodular, it follows that\n1 + \u03c6p = In + v.wt \u2208 En (R). Similarly, in the non-linear cases we have \u03c3(u,v) (p) =\nIn + v.w\ne + w.e\nv , and \u03c4(u,v) (p) = In + v.w\ne \u2212 w.e\nv , where either v or w is unimodular and\nhv, wi = 0. (Here \u03c3(u,v) and \u03c4(u,v) are as in the definition of symplectic and orthogonal\ntransvections.) Historically, these are known to be elementary matrices - for details\nsee [13] for the linear case, [10] for the symplectic case, and [14] for the orthogonal\ncase.\n\u2737\nRemark 2.21 Lemma 2.20 holds for n = 4 in the symplectic and the orthogonal\ncases. This will follow from Remark 2.22.\nRemark 2.22 ESp4 (A) is a normal subgroup of Sp4 (A) by ([10], Corollary 1.11).\nAlso ESp4 (A[X]) satisfies the Dilation Principle and the Local-Global Principle by\n([10], Theorem 3.6). Since we were intent on a uniform proof, these cases have not\nbeen covered by us.\nNotation 2.23 When P = An (n is even in the non-linear cases), we also use the\nnotation G(n, A), S(n, A) and E(n, A) for G(P ), S(P ) and T(P ) respectively. We\ndenote the usual standard elementary generators of E(n, A) by geij (x), x \u2208 A. ei will\ndenote the column vector (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0)t (1 at the i-th position).\nRemark\n\u201e 2.24 Note that if \u03b1 \u2208\u00abEnd(Q) then \u03b1 can be considered as a matrix of the\nEnd(P )\nHom(P, A)\nin the linear case. In the non-linear cases one has\nform\nHom(A, P )\n\nEnd(A)\n\na similar matrix for \u03b1 of the form\n\n\u201e\n\nEnd(P )\nHom(A \u2295 A, P )\n\n6\n\nHom(P, A \u2295 A)\nEnd(A \u2295 A)\n\n\u00ab\n\n.\n\n\f3\n\nLocal-Global Principle for the Transvection Groups\n\nIn this section we deduce an analogue of Quillen's Local-Global Principle for the\nlinear, symplectic and isotropic orthogonal transvection groups.\nProposition 3.1 (Dilation Principle) Let A be an associative R-algebra such that\nA is finite as a left R-module and R be a commutative ring with identity. Let P and\nQ be as in 2.18. Assume that (H2) holds. Let s be a non-nilpotent in R such that Ps\nis free, and let \u03c3(X) \u2208 G(Q[X]) with \u03c3(0) = Id. Suppose\n(\nE(n + 1, As [X])\nin the linear case,\n\u03c3s (X) \u2208\nE(2n + 2, As [X]) otherwise.\nThen there exists \u03c3\u0302(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]) and l > 0 such that \u03c3\u0302(X) localizes to \u03c3(bX) for\nsome b \u2208 (sl ) and \u03c3\u0302(0) = Id.\nFirst we state the following useful lemmas.\nLemma 3.2 Let R be a ring and M be a finitely presented left (right) R-module and\nN be any R-module. Then we have a natural isomorphism:\n\u03b3 : HomR (M, N )[X] \u2192 HomR[X] (M [X], N [X]).\nLemma 3.3 Let S be a multiplicative closed subset of a ring R.

Since elementary transvections can always be lifted, we\ncan and hence assume that R is reduced. We show that there exists l > 0 such that\n\u03c3(bX) \u2208 ET(Q[X]) for all b \u2208 (sk )R, for all k \u2265 l.\nAs \u03c3(0) = Id, we can write \u03c3s (X) = \u03a0\u03b3k geik jk (X\u03bbk (X))\u03b3k\u22121 , where \u03bbk (X) \u2208\nk\n\nAs [X].

Let\n\u03b3k = \u03b51 \u03b52 . . . \u03b5r , and d = 2r\u22121 . Now apply Lemma 3.4 for m = 1, X = T , and Y = 1.\nThen use the fact that i 6= 1 6= j,\ngeij (T 2 \u03bc(X)) = [gei1 (T \u03bc(X)), ge1j (T )],\n\n7\n\n\fin the linear case, and\n\uf8f1\n[gei1 (T \u03bc(X)), ge1j (T )]\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ge (T \u03bc(X))[ge (\u2212T \u03bc(X)), ge (\u2212T )]\n1j\n1l\ni1\ngeij (T 2 \u03bc(X)) =\n\uf8f4\n[ge\n(T\n\u03bc(X)),\nse\n(T\n)]\n\u03c3(i)1\n1\u03c3(j)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nge1\u03c3j (T \u03bc(X))[ge1\u03c3(l) (\u2212T \u03bc(X)), ge\u03c3(i)1 (\u2212T )]\n\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\ni 6= \u03c3(j)\ni = \u03c3(j)\ni 6= \u03c3(j)\ni = \u03c3(j)\n\nin the non-linear cases for some l \u2264 n, when i + 1 is even and when \u03c3(i) + 1 is\neven respectively.

For qt = i, consider the element T \u03bct (X)e\u2217i \u2208 Aks [X, T ] as an element in Ps [X, T ]\u2217.\nUsing Lemma 3.2, we may say T \u03bct (X)e\u2217i is actually a polynomial in T . By Lemma\n3.3, there exists k1 > 0 such that k1 is the maximum power of s occurring in the\ndenominator of \u03bct (X)e\u2217i . Choose l1 \u2265 max(k1 , m).\nNext suppose qt = 1. For pt = j, T \u03bct (X)e\u2217j \u2208 Ps [X, T ]. From Lemma 3.3 it\nfollows that we can choose k2 > 0 such that k2 is the maximum power of s occurring\nin \u03bct (X)e\u2217j . Again, using Lemma 3.2, we can regard T \u03bct (X)e\u2217j as a polynomial in T .\nChoose l2 \u2265 max(k2 , m) and l \u2265 max(l1 , l2 ). Now applying homomorphism T 7\u2192 sl T\nit follows that \u03c3(bXT 2d) is defined over Q[X].

If \u03b1 = (aij ) is an r \u00d7 r\nmatrix over R with all entries nilpotent, then \u03b1 is nilpotent.\nProof. Let alij = 0, for all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , r}. Now \u03b12 has entries which are homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in the aij 's. Consequently, \u03b14 has entries which are\nm\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in the aij 's, and so on. Therefore, \u03b12 = 0, if\n2m > lr2 , by the Pigeon Hole Principle.\n\u2737\nCorollary 3.9 Let A be an associative R-algebra such that A is finite as a left Rmodule and R be a commutative ring with identity. Let 'bar' denote the reduction\nmodulo Nil(R). Assume that (H1) holds. Then for \u03c4 \u2208 G(Q), \u03c4 \u2208 ET(Q) if and only\nif \u03c4 \u2208 ET(Q).\nProof. First we show that for \u03c3(X) \u2208 G(Q[X]), \u03c3(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]) \u21d4 \u03c3(X) \u2208\nET(Q[X]). Suppose \u03c3(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]). Then \u03c3p (X) \u2208 ET(Ap [X]) = E(n+ 1, Ap [X])\nand E(2n + 2, Ap [X]) in the linear and the non-linear cases respectively, for all p \u2208\nSpec(R). But then from Lemma 3.5 it follows that\n(\nE(n + 1, Ap [X]) in the linear case, and\n\u03c3p (X) \u2208\nE(2n + 2, Ap [X]) otherwise.\nHence by Theorem 3.6, \u03c3(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]).\nNow modifying \u03c4 by some \u03b5 \u2208 ET(Q) we assume that \u03c4 = Id + \u03b3, where \u03b3 \u2261 0\nmodulo Nil(R). As the nilpotent entries are in R, which is a commutative ring, by\nLemma 3.8, \u03b3 is nilpotent. Define \u03b8(X) = Id + X\u03b3. As \u03b8(X) = Id \u2208 ET(Q[X]), from\nabove it follows that \u03b8(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]). Whence \u03c4 = \u03b8(1) \u2208 ET(Q); as required. \u2737\nTheorem 3.10 Let A be an associative R-algebra such that A is finite as a left Rmodule and R be a commutative ring with identity.

Now, for every p \u2208 Spec(R),\n(\nE(n + 1, Ap [X]), in the linear case, and\n\u03c3p \u2208\nE(2n + 2, Ap [X]), otherwise.\nTherefore, by Theorem 3.6 it follows that \u03c3(X) \u2208 ET(Q[X]). Whence \u03c4 = \u03c3(1) \u2208\nET(Q); as required.\n\u2737\nThe next lemma was proved in the linear case in ([5], Proposition 4.1). They\ndo not assume the existence of a unimodular element in Q though, and only get a\nunipotent lift. In ([4], Lemma 2.1) it is mentioned that if Q has a unimodular element\nthen the lift is a transvection.\nCorollary 3.11 Let A be an associative R-algebra such that A is finite as a left Rmodule and R be a commutative ring with identity.

Let Q be as in 2.18. Assume that\n(H1) and (H2) holds. Let v(X) = (p(X), a(X)) be a unimodular element in Q[X]\nwith v(0) = (0, 1). Suppose for all prime ideal p \u2208 Spec(R) there exists\n(\nE(n + 1, Ap [X]) in the linear case, and\n\u03c4p (X) \u2208 T(Qp [X]) =\nE(2n + 2, Ap [X]) in non-linear cases\nwith \u03c4p (0) = In such that v(X)\u03c4 (X) = v(0). Then there exists \u03c4 (X) \u2208 ET(Q[X])\nwith \u03c4 (0) = Id such that v(X)\u03c4 (X) = v(0).\n\n4\n\nThe unstable K1 -groups\n\nS(Q)\nET(Q)\n\nare nilpotent\n\nIn this section earlier results on unstable K1 -groups of classical groups of A. Bak,\nR. Hazrat, and H. Vavilov have been uniformly generalized to classical modules.\nWe prove Theorem 3 mentioned in the introduction. Before that we give a brief\nhistorical sketch about our result. Throughout this section we assume R is a commutative ring with identity.\nIn [1], A. Bak defines a functorial filtration GLn (R) = S\u22121 Ln (R) \u2283 S0 Ln (R)\n\u2283 * * * \u2283 Si Ln (R) \u2283 * * * \u2283 En (R) of the general linear group GLn (R), where R is\nan associative ring with identity and n \u2265 3, which is a descending central series.\nHis construction has its own merits; which we do not study here though, other than\n10\n\n\fthe fact that the quotient GLn (R)/En (R) is nilpotent-by-abelian. A. Bak uses a\nlocalization-completion method; we show that the localization part suffices to get the\ndesired result.\nIn [9], R. Hazrat and N. Vavilov have shown: Let \u03a6 be a reduced irreducible root\nsystem of rank \u2265 2 and R be a commutative ring such that its Bass-Serre dimension\n\u03b4(R) is finite. Then for any Chevalley group G(\u03a6, R) of type \u03a6 over R the quotient\nG(\u03a6, R)/E(\u03a6, R) is nilpotent-by-abelian. In particular, K1 (\u03a6, R) is nilpotent of class\nat most \u03b4(R) + 1. They use the localization-completion method of A. Bak in [1],\nwho showed that K1 (n, R) is nilpotent-by-abelian. Their main result is to construct a\ndescending central series in the Chevalley group, indexed by the Bass-Serre dimension\nof the factor-rings of the ground ring. Our approach show that for classical groups\nthe localization part suffices.\nThe precise statement of our theorem is the following:\nTheorem 4.1 Assume the notation in 2.18. We assume that (H1) and (H2) holds\nand R is noetherian. Let d = dim (R) and t = local rank of Q.\nThe quotient group Q/T(Q) is nilpotent of class at most max (1, d + 3 \u2212 t) in the\nlinear case and max(1, d + 3 \u2212 t/2) otherwise.\n(We assume Q that global rank of Q is at least 1 and lonal rank of Q is at least 3\nin all the above cases).\nCorollary 4.2 Let d = dim (R) and t = local rank of Q. The quotient group Q/ET(Q)\nis nilpotent of class at most max (1, d+3\u2212t) in the linear case and max(1, d+3\u2212t/2)\notherwise.\nRecall\nDefinition 4.3 Let H be a group. Define Z 0 = H, Z 1 = [H, H] and Z i = [H, Z i\u22121 ].\nThen H is said to be nilpotent if Z r = {e} for some r > 0, where e denotes the identity\nelement of H.\nRemark 4.4 The standard generators of E(n, R) satisfy the following relation:\n[geik (x), gekj (y)] = geij (zxy)\nfor x, y \u2208 R and some z \u2208 N (fixed for the group), and 1 \u2264 i 6= j 6= k \u2264 n, j 6= \u03c3i, \u03c3j,\nwhere \u03c3 is the permutation given by 2l 7\u2192 2l \u2212 1 and 2l \u2212 1 7\u2192 2l.\nNotation 4.5 Let S(n, sl R) be the subgroup of S(n, R) consisting of matrices which\nare identity modulo sl R and S(Q, sl R) the subgroup of S(Q) consisting of the automorphisms with determinant 1 which are identity modulo sl R.\nLet J(R) denote the Jacobson radical of R.\nLemma 4.6 Let \u03b2 \u2208 S(n, R), with \u03b2 \u2261 In modulo I, where I is contained in the\nJacobson radical J(R) of R. Then there exists \u03b5 \u2208 E(n, R) such that \u03b2\u03b5= the diagonal\nmatrix [d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ], where each di is a unit in R and each di satisfies d\u03c3i d\u2217i = 1,\nand \u03b5 a product of elementary generators with each congruent to identity modulo I.\n\n11\n\n\fProof. The diagonal elements are units. Using this one can establish the result easily\nin the linear case. In the symplectic and the orthogonal cases by multiplying from\nthe right side by suitable standard elementary generators each of which is congruent\nto identity modulo I we can make all the (1, j)-th entries zero for j = 3, . . . , n. Since\nchar R 6= 2, in the orthogonal case the (1, 2)-th entry will be then automatically zero.\nIn the symplectic case again by multiplying from right side by suitable elementary\ngenerators we can make the (1, 2)-th entry zero. Similarly, multiplying by left we can\nmake the first column of \u03b2 to be (d1 , 0, . . . , 0)t , where d1 is a unit in R and d1 \u2261 1\nmodulo I. Repeating the above process we can reduce the size of \u03b2. Note that after\nmodifying the first row and the first column in the symplectic and the orthogonal\ncases the second row and column will automatically become (0, d2 , 0, . . . , 0)t for some\nunit d2 in R, with d2 \u2261 1 modulo I. Repeating the process we can modify \u03b2 to the\nrequired form.\n\u2737\nBlanket assumption: Henceforth we shall assume that the matrices have size at\nleast 3 \u00d7 3 when dealing with the linear case and at least 6 \u00d7 6 when dealing with the\nsymplectic and the orthogonal cases.\nLemma 4.7 Let R be a commutative ring and s be a non-zero divisor in R. Let D\ndenote the diagonal matrix [d1 , . . . , dn ], where di should be units and satisfy d\u03c3i d\u2217i = 1,\nand di \u2261 1 modulo (sl ) for l \u2265 2. Then\n\u0010a \u0011 i\nh\ngeij\nX , D \u2282 E(n, R[X]) \u2229 S(n, (sl\u22121 )R).\ns\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\na\na\na\nProof. Let d = di d\u22121\nj .

Since\ndi , dj \u2261 1 modulo (sl ) for l \u2265 2, we can write d = 1 + sm \u03bb for some m > 2 and \u03bb \u2208 R.\nHence\ngeij\n\n\" a\n\"a \"\n\" a \"\n\" a\n\"\n\"\n\"\nX geij \u2212 dX = geij\nX geij \u2212 X geij \u2212 sm \u03bbX\ns\ns\ns\n\"s a\n\" s\nm\n= geij \u2212 s \u03bbX \u2208 E(n, R[X]) \u2229 S(n, (sm\u22121 )R).\ns\n\n\"a\n\n\u2737\n\nLemma 4.8 Let R be a ring, s \u2208 R a non-zero divisor in R and a \u2208 R.

First fix (i, j) for i 6= j. Let \u03b1(X) = [eij as X , \u03b2] for some \u03b2 \u2208 S(n, sl R). As\nl \u2265 2, it follows that \u03b1(X) \u2208 S(n, R[X]). Since E(n, R[X]) is a normal subgroup of\nS(n, R[X]), we get \u03b1s (X) \u2208 E(n, Rs [X]). Let B = 1 + sR. We show that \u03b1B (X) \u2208\nE(n, RB [X]). Since s \u2208 J(RB ), it follows from Lemma 4.6 that we can decompose\n\u03b2B = \u03b51 * * * \u03b5t D, where \u03b5i = gepi qi (sl \u03bbi ) \u2208 E(n, RB ); \u03bbi \u2208 RB and D = the diagonal\nmatrix [d1 , . . . , dn ] with di is a unit in R and di \u2261 1 modulo (sl ) for l \u2265 2; i =\n1, . . . , n. If t = 1, then using the commutator law and Lemma 4.7 it follows that\n\u03b1B (X) \u2208 E(n, RB [X]). Suppose t > 1. Then\n\u0010a \u0011\ni\nh\nX , \u03b51 * * * \u03b5t D\n\u03b1B (X) = geij\ns \u0011\ni\ni h\nh\n\u0010a \u0011\n\u0010a\nX , \u03b51 \u03b51 geij\nX , \u03b52 * * * \u03b5t D \u03b5\u22121\n= geij\n1\ns\ns\n12\n\n\fand by induction each term is in E(n, RB [X]), hence \u03b1B (X) \u2208 E(n, RB [X]). Since\n\u03b1(0) = In , by the Local-Global Principle for the classical groups it follows that\n\u03b1(X) \u2208 E(n, R[X]).\n\u2737\nCorollary 4.9 Let R be a ring, s \u2208 R be a non-zero divisor in R and a \u2208 R. Then\nfor l \u2265 2\n\u0010a\u0011\nh\ni\ngeij\n, S(n, sl R) \u2282 E(n, R).\ns\n\u0002\n\u0003\nl\nMore generally, \u03b5, S(n, s R) \u2282 E(n, R) for l \u226b 0 and \u03b5 \u2208 E(n, Rs ).\n\nLemma 4.10 Fix the notation as in 2.18. Let s be a non-zero divisor in R such\nthat Ps is free. Assume that (H2) holds. Suppose \u03c4 \u2208 T(Qs ). Then for l \u226b 0,\n[\u03c4, S(Q, sl R)] \u2282 T(Q).\nProof. Let \u03b7 \u2208 S(Q, sl R) and \u03c4e(X) \u2208 T(Qs [X]) be an isotopy between the identity\nmap and \u03c4 ; i.e. \u03c4e(0) =Id and \u03c4e(1) = \u03c4 . Let \u03b1(X) = [e\n\u03c4 (X), \u03b7]. Now, since \u03b7 \u2261 Id\nmodulo (sl ), \u03b7 = Id + sl \u03c8 for some \u03c8 \u2208 End(Q). Therefore, \u03c8 can be considered as a\nmatrix as in Remark 2.24. Hence \u03c4e(X) \u03b7 \u03c4e(X)\u22121 = Id + sl \u03c4e(X)\u03c8e\n\u03c4 (X)\u22121 \u2208 S(Q[X])\nfor l \u226b 0. As 'T' is a normal subgroup of 'S', it follows that \u03b1s (X) \u2208 T(Qs [X]). Let\nB = 1 + sR. We show that \u03b1B (X) \u2208 T(QB [X]). Note that s \u2208 Jac(RB ). Hence for\nall m \u2208 Max(RB ),\n(\nE(n + 1, (RB )m )\nin the linear case\n(\u03b7B )m \u2208 S((QB )m , sl (RB )m ) =\nE(2n + 2, (RB )m ) otherwise.\nTherefore, by Lemma 4.7, (\u03b7B )m can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices over (RB )m with each being identity modulo (sl ), and a diagonal matrix D =\n[d1 , . . . , dt ], where t = r + 1 in the linear case and r + 2 otherwise, and di are\nunits in R for i = 1, . . . , t. Let (\u03b7B )m = \u03a0ki=1 \u03b5i D, where \u03b5i is in En+1 ((RB )m )\nin the linear case and in E2n+2 ((RB )m ) otherwise, and \u03b5i =Id modulo (sl ). So,\n(\u03b1B )m (X) = [e\n\u03c4 (X), \u03b51 * * * \u03b5k D]. Hence by Lemma 4.7 and Lemma 4.8, we get\n(\nE(n + 1, (RB )m [X])\nin the linear case\n(\u03b1B )m (X) \u2208\nE(2n + 2, (RB )m [X]) otherwise.\nHence by the L-G Principle for the tranvection groups we get \u03b1B (X) \u2208 T(QB [X]).\nTherefore, it follows from Corollary 3.7 that \u03b1(X) \u2208 T(Q[X]). In particular, [\u03c4, \u03b7] \u2208\nT(Q).\n\u2737\nProof of Theorem 4.1. Using Corollary 3.9 we may and do assume that R is a\nreduced ring. Note that if t \u2265 d + 3, then the group S(Q)/T(Q) = K1 (Q), which\nis abelian and hence nilpotent. So we consider the case t \u2264 d + 3. Let us first fix\na t. We prove the theorem by induction on d = dim R. Let H = S(Q)/T(Q). Let\nm = d + 3 \u2212 t and \u03b1 = [\u03b2, \u03b3] for some \u03b2 \u2208 H and \u03b3 \u2208 Z m\u22121 . Clearly, the result\nis true for d = 0. Let \u03b2e be the pre-image of \u03b2 under the map S(Q) \u2192 S(Q)/T(Q).\nChoose a non-nilpotent element s in R such that Ps is free and \u03b2es \u2208 E(n, As ). We\ndefine H = S(Q)/T(Q), where bar denote reduction modulo sl for some l \u226b 0. By\nthe induction hypothesis \u03b3 = {1} in G(Q). Since T(Q) is a normal subgroup of S(Q)\n13\n\n\ffor n \u2265 3 in the linear case and for n \u2265 4 otherwise, by modifying \u03b3 we may assume\nthat \u03b3\ne \u2208 S(Q, sl A), where \u03b3\ne is the pre image of \u03b3 in S(Q). Now by Lemma 4.10 it\ne\u03b3\nfollows that [\u03b2,\ne] \u2208 T(Q). Hence \u03b1 = {1} in H.\n\u2737\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors thank W. van der Kallen for pointing out that\nthe argument here does not work with sdim instead of dim in Theorem 4.1, and\nCorollary 4.2.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
