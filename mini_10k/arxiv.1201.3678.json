It is very nearby (distance of only\n80 pc) and is a fast rotator (period of around 0.52 days)\n(Deutsch 1952). Its strong magnetic field (polar magnetic\nfield of \u223c3 kG) places it in the category of Magnetic Chemically Peculiar (MCP) stars. Like other MCP stars, its\neffective magnetic field has been observed to vary with\nrotational phase (Borra & Landstreet 1980). In addition,\nMCP stars are known radio emitters (Linsky et al. 1992;\nLeone et al. 1994; Drake et al. 1987) and their radio emission has been observed to modulate with rotational phase\n(Leone & Umana 1993; Leone 1991). This quiescent radio\nemission is believed to be gyrosynchrotron radiation emitted by mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor of \u03b3 \u2264 2) electrons trapped in the magnetosphere (Drake et al. 1987).\nTrigilio et al. (2004) constructed a three-dimensional model\nto explain the rotational modulation of the quiescent radio\nemission from a MCP star and Leto et al. (2006) successfully applied it to CU Vir.\nCircular polarisation in the radio emission was detected\nat the 10% level by Leone et al. (1996) which is expected for\nthe gyrosynchrotron emission. Subsequently, Trigilio et al.\nc 2011 RAS\n\n(2000) discovered that CU Vir produces two 100% circularly\npolarised radio pulses every rotation period which cannot\narise from the gyrosynchrotron emission mechanism.\nThe observed radio flux for CU Vir across one rotation period is hereafter described as the \"pulse profile\". The\ntwo components in the pulse profile are referred to as the\n\"leading\" and \"trailing\" pulses. Similar pulse profiles have\nbeen observed from CU Vir in the 13 cm and 20 cm observing bands (Trigilio et al. 2000, 2008, 2011; Ravi et al. 2010)\nwhere observations were separated by almost a decade. CU\nVir is the only MCP star that has been observed to emit\nradio pulses.\nTrigilio et al. (2000) proposed electron cyclotron maser\n(ECM) as the emission mechanism for the pulsed radio emission. Plasma radiation due to Langmuir waves was ruled\nout (Trigilio et al. 2008) because of the low electron density in the emission region as modelled by Leto et al. (2006)\nand the observation that requires the radiation to be tightly\nbeamed. ECM can produce radiation with high directivity\nand 100% circular polarization. In the \"loss cone\" model of\nECM (Melrose & Dulk 1982), ECM emission forms a hollow cone at a large angle (70\u25e6 to 85\u25e6 ) to the magnetic field\nlines, and occupies a narrow frequency band close to a har-\n\n\f2\n\nK.K.Lo et al.\n\nmonic of the cyclotron frequency. Although ECM is narrow\nband, the relatively wide band of the observation can be\nexplained if the emission region spans a range of magnetic\nfield strengths.\nA simple ECM model does not explain all the features of\nthe pulsed radio emission from CU Vir. For instance, in the\n20 cm observing band, the leading and trailing pulses are\nseparated by \u223c 5 hours. In the 13 cm observing band, the\nleading pulse was not seen in observations by Trigilio et al.\n(2008), but was seen a decade later by Ravi et al. (2010). In\ncontrast to the variability of the leading pulse, the trailing\npulse shows remarkable stability over more than a decade\nin both observing bands. The trailing pulse at 13 cm is always observed to arrive earlier than the corresponding 20 cm\npulse. Trigilio et al. (2008) postulated that this has a geometric explanation, which is related to where the pulse originates in the magnetosphere. The discovery from Ravi et al.\n(2010) that the leading 13 cm pulse arrives later than the\ncorresponding 20 cm pulse, agrees with this interpretation\nand suggests that both pulses come from the same magnetic\npole of the star. However, until now, existing data do not\nprovide enough frequency coverage to study the pulse profile in detail as a function of observing frequency. Here we\npresent new data with more complete frequency coverage\nover the 13 cm and 20 cm observing bands and demonstrate\nwith our modelling that an ECM emission model, without\npropagation effects, cannot explain the observations. In a\nrecent paper, Trigilio et al. (2011) suggest the frequency dependence of the pulse arrival time arises from frequency dependent refraction of the radiation through the stellar magnetosphere. In this paper, we have analysed the frequency\ndependent refraction model in more detail.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we present\nthe observing and analysis techniques used to detect time\nvarying emission from CU Vir with the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) and present our observational results. In \u00a73 we discuss our modelling and show how it relates\nto our observations.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nWe observed CU Vir with the ATCA on six separate occasions (2009 December 23 to 26, 2010 May 19, 2010 June\n15). The observations in December 2009 were only two hours\neach in length because they were taken during unallocated\ntelescope time. For these short observations, we predicted\nthe arrival time of the trailing pulse using the ephemeris\nfrom Ravi et al. (2010) and timed our observation accordingly. We were allocated time for the May and June 2010\nepochs and hence were able to observe for about nine hours\ncontinuously. A summary of the observation parameters is\ngiven in Table 1.\nAll our observations were taken with the Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB; Wilson 2011) which offers\na bandwidth of up to 2 GHz per intermediate frequency and\npolarisation. However, the maximum bandwidth in our 20\nand 13 cm observing bands was limited to around 700 MHz\nbecause our observations were taken before the upgrade was\nfully completed. Furthermore, it was not possible to observe\nat 20 and 13 cm simultaneously. To maximise the apparent\nbandwidth, we switched between the 20 and 13 cm bands\n\nevery few minutes in the 2009 Dec 25 to 26 and 2010 May\n19 epochs. Complex visibility data in four polarisations were\nrecorded for 15 baselines with a sampling time of 10 s.\nWe also made use of archival (pre-CABB) ATCA data\nto supplement our analysis. Altogether, we analysed eight\nepochs of data at 20 cm and seven epochs at 13 cm as summarised in Table 1. In column order we provide the date of\nobservation, the observing frequencies used1 , the available\nbandwidth, the configuration of the ATCA2 , the total integration time, the phase calibrator used and a reference for\nthe data.\nWe calibrated our data using the standard miriad\nsoftware package (Sault et al. 1995)3 . The flux amplitude\nscale and the bandpass response were determined from the\nbackup ATCA primary calibrator 0823\u2212500. Observations\nof a bright compact radio source (as listed in Table 1) for 1.5\nminutes every 20 minutes were used to calibrate the complex gains and leakage between the orthogonal linear feeds\nin each antenna. Radio frequency interference was removed\nfrom the visibilities using the flagging tool mirflag.\nTo obtain light curves, we first imaged the field in the\nstandard way. Then, we took the clean components of each\nsource, masking the location of CU Vir, and subtracted them\nfrom the visibility data using the miriad task uvmodel. We\nthen shifted the phase centre of the visibilities to the location\nof CU Vir and measured the flux density directly from the\nvisibilities by vector averaging their real components in time\nbins of three minutes.\n2.1\n\nPulse profile\n\nThe 20 and 13 cm Stokes V pulse profiles from our observations, along with other archival epochs, are shown in\nFigures 1 and 2 respectively. The Stokes V flux densities\nare plotted against rotational phase using the ephemeris\nfrom Trigilio et al. (2011) and adjusted for the rotation of\nthe Earth around the Sun. We have used the rotation period, P = 0.52071601 days from Trigilio et al. (2011) to\nalign the light curves and set phase zero, in HJD, to be\n2450966.3601 + EP, where E is the number of epochs. As\ncan be seen in Figures 1 and 2, the rotation period is a good\nfit to our data as the pulses are aligned in phase.\nIn the May 2010 epoch, we detected both the leading\nand trailing pulses. The time between them is 5.20\u00b10.05\nhours in the 20 cm observing band. This is similar to the\npulse separation time determined by Trigilio et al. (2000)\nand Ravi et al. (2010) in earlier epochs. In Figure 3, we have\njuxtaposed measurement of the effective magnetic field from\nPyper et al. (1998) with the average Stokes V pulse profiles.\nAssuming a dipolar field structure, and take negative effective magnetic field to mean the field lines point into the star,\nthe magnetic South pole is closest to our line of sight during\nthe shorter of the two pulse separations.\n1\n\nWe refer to the 1384 MHz pre-CABB and 1503 MHz CABB\nfrequencies as the 20 cm band; and the pre-CABB 2496 MHz and\nCABB 2335 MHz frequencies as the 13 cm band\n2 In\nall cases a maximum baseline of 6 km was\nused. The various labels (6A, 6C and 6D) refer\nto different antenna spacings, which are defined at\nhttp://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/operations/array_configurations/configu\n3 http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad/\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fObservations and modelling of pulsed radio emission from CU Virginis\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Although the trailing pulse was detected in all epochs for which we have data at the relevant\nphase, the peak flux density varied between 6-12 mJy in the\n20 cm observing band, and 7-13 mJy in the 13 cm observing band. With our data we can constrain the frequency at\nwhich the pulse disappears to be between 1.9 and 2.3 GHz\nin the 19 May 2010 epoch.\nFigure 4 shows the pulse profiles, in 200 MHz channels,\nfor the 19 May 2010 epoch. The pulse arrival phase is dependent upon the observing frequency. This dependence is\nclearly observed for the trailing pulse in the 26 Dec 2009\nepoch (Figure 5). This frequency dependence is stable over\nat least six months since we observe similar phenomenon in\nthe trailing pulse in the 26 Dec 2009 epoch. We determined\nthe arrival phase of the pulses by cross correlating the single\nepoch pulse and the average pulse, and finding the phase\nof the peak of the cross correlation. The error of the pulse\narrival phase is the variation of the parameter required to\nincrease the reduced \u03c72 between the single epoch pulse and\nthe average pulse by one unit.

This may\nbe explained by the presence of a quadrupole component in\nthe magnetic field of CU Vir (Trigilio et al. 2000).

(1988),\nshown in Figure 6. The cold torus, containing trapped material from the stellar wind, is an extension by Trigilio et al.\n(2004).\nIn this model, electrons are accelerated by magnetic reconnection in the magnetic equatorial plane of the star, and\npropagate along field lines towards the magnetic poles. They\nare reflected through magnetic mirroring; however, electrons\nwith sufficiently small pitch angles will instead intersect the\nsurface of the star. This results in a loss-cone anisotropy\nin the pitch angles of this population of electrons, allowing them to produce radio emission through the electron\ncyclotron maser mechanism (Trigilio et al. 2000).\nECM emission occurs close to a harmonic of the cyclotron frequency: \u03bd = s\u03bdcyc , where s is the harmonic number. We assume the emission to be in the second harmonic,\ns = 2, because the fundamental, s = 1, is generally suppressed by gyromagnetic absorption of the thermal plasma\n\n1\n\n3.2\n\nModel parameters\n\nTable 3 lists the parameters we use for our modelling.\nThe obliquity of the magnetic axis was calculated by\nTrigilio et al. (2000) from measurements of the variation\nin effective magnetic field strength given an inclination i.\nLeto et al. (2006) derived the Alfv\u00e9n radius and thickness\nof the magnetosphere by fitting multifrequency radio flux\ndensities to a three-dimensional magnetospheric model simulating the quiescent gyrosynchrotron emission. The dipole\nmoment is calculated from a value of 3 kG for the magnetic field strength at both poles from Trigilio et al. (2000).\nHatzes (1997) suggest an off-centre dipole model, with different surface magnetic field strengths at each pole, but these\nvalues give a similar dipole moment4 . We use only the central value for each parameter, ignoring the uncertainty.\n3.3\n\nEmission from field lines parallel to the\nmagnetic axis\n\nThe first model for the pulsed emission from CU Vir is from\nTrigilio et al. (2000). The emission is assumed to be directed\nas a hollow cone, making an angle of 85\u25e6 with the local magnetic field. At this point, it was believed that the population\n4 Since the star is treated here simply as a rotating dipolar field,\nthe actual position of its surface is not required for the modelling.\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n1\n\n\fObservations and modelling of pulsed radio emission from CU Virginis\n\n5\n\nFigure 6. Cross-section of the magnetosphere of CU Vir used in our modelling (not to scale). The magnetic field is assumed to be\ndipolar within the Alfv\u00e9n surface (heavy dashes), with equatorial radius rA . Beyond this radius, field lines (light dashes) are distorted by\nthe stellar wind. Electrons are accelerated in equatorial current sheets beyond the Alfv\u00e9n radius, and travel along field lines within the\nmiddle magnetosphere (shaded), which divides the inner and outer magnetospheres. The parameter l describes the extent of the middle\nmagnetosphere, indicating the position of the projection (dotted) of the field line marking its outer boundary within the Alfv\u00e9n surface.\nCooled gas from the stellar wind accumulates in a torus (shaded) near the star.\n\nSee appendix A1 for details.\n(iii) Determine the strength of emission in this direction.\nThe emission pattern is a hollow cone making an angle of\n85\u25e6 with the north magnetic axis; i.e., at a magnetic latitude\nof +5\u25e6 . We assume the emission to have a narrow Gaussian\nprofile centred on this latitude.\n(iv) Repeat steps (i)-(iii) for different rotation phases to\nform a pulse profile.\n\nTable 3.

We do not attempt to predict the\nabsolute flux density, but instead scale the peak of the simulated pulse profile to match our observations.\nThe result of this simulation is shown in Figure 7 (right\npanel). This model correctly predicts the arrival times of the\npulses. However, it does not fit the width of the pulses, nor\ntheir frequency dependence (which had not been observed\nwhen this model was developed).\n3.4\n\nEmission from dipolar magnetic field lines\n\nThis model for the pulsed emission from CU Vir is from\nTrigilio et al.

The simulated pulses are too wide to fit the observations, and display\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\nRefracted equatorial emission\n\nThis model for the pulsed emission from CU Vir is from\nTrigilio et al. (2011). Rather than a hollow cone centred on\nthe local field line, the ECM emission is assumed to be directed perpendicular to the local field line, and only in the\ntwo directions which are also parallel to the magnetic equatorial plane. For each longitude in the magnetic equatorial\nplane, this results in emission being visible from two points\nin the emission region.\nThe key point of this model is that it includes the\neffect of refraction as the radiation crosses the boundary\nof the cold torus region (Figure 6). We neglect the effects\nof refraction from density variations within the cold torus,\nor from the interface where the radiation exits the torus.\nThe refractive index outside the cold torus is assumed to\nbe unity. Inside the torus, the refractive index nct depends\non the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the radiation (Gurnett & Bhattacharjee 2005), but if we assume\nthem to be parallel it is:\n\nnct =\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03bdp2\n\u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdcyc )\n\n(4)\n\nFor a plasma density in the cold torus of 109 cm\u22123 ,\ncompatible with Leto et al. (2006), the plasma frequency is\n\u03bdp = 280 MHz. If we assume that the magnetic field strength\nat the point of refraction is approximately the same as at the\npoint of emission, we have the cyclotron frequency \u03bdcyc =\n\u03bd/2 (if the emission is at the second harmonic).\nIf the angle of incidence \u03b1i with the boundary of\nthe torus (see Figure 10) is assumed to be 60\u25e6 , as by\nTrigilio et al. (2011), the angle of refraction \u03b1R can be found\nwith Snell's law:\nsin \u03b1R =\n\n1\nsin \u03b1i\nnct\n\n(5)\n\nFor nct < sin \u03b1i , this implies that the radiation is entirely reflected at the interface, and none is transmitted.\nUnder the conditions assumed here, this occurs for \u03bd < 790\nMHz, so the pulse spectrum should be truncated below this\nfrequency. However, this is below the frequency range of our\nobservations, so we cannot test this here.\nOur simulation procedure is as follows:\n(i) Select a rotation phase and convert to magnetic latitude, as in section 3.3.\n(ii) Convert from the magnetic latitude of the emission\nto the angle of refraction. From our assumption about the\nangle of incidence, this is done by adding 60\u25e6 .\n(iii) Calculate the refractive index at this frequency with\nequation 4.\n(iv) Determine the angle of incidence with equation 5.\n(v) Convert from the angle of incidence to the original\nmagnetic latitude of the emission.

The Gaussian function used in step\n(vi) is very narrow (width < 0.2\u25e6 ), so the width of the resulting profile is due to variation with frequency across the\nobservation band.\nResults are shown in Figure 10 (right panel). The pulse\narrival times and their frequency dependence both fit the\nobservations.

This confirms that\nthe 20 cm pulses are stable over a period of more than a\ndecade. We did not detect the 13 cm leading pulse that was\nobserved a year earlier by Ravi et al. (2010). For our data,\nthe leading pulse has a spectrum which cuts off between\n1.9 and 2.3 GHz. We can see a clear frequency dependency\nin the time between leading and trailing pulses across our\nentire observing band.\nWe have simulated in detail the emission models proposed by Trigilio et al. (2000), Trigilio et al. (2008) and\nTrigilio et al. (2011). We show that the first two models do\nnot fit our observations, the first being excluded by its lack of\n\nREFERENCES\nAndre P., Montmerle T., Feigelson E. D., Stine P.

To derive the relationship,\nwe construct vectors:\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\nA2\n\nConical emission\n\nStep (v) of the procedure in section 3.4 assumes a relation,\nequation 2, between the magnetic latitude of emission \u03b8E\nand the position \u03c9 of that emission on a cone, as shown in\nFigure 8. To demonstrate this, we note that Figure A1 is\nequivalent to Figure 8, with the following substitutions:\n\n\f10\n\nK.K.Lo et al.\n\nFigure A1. Rotation of CU Vir. The magnetic axis M\u0302 and the\nrotation axis R\u0302 are inclined by \u03b2. In the reference frame of the\nstar, the vector towards the Earth \u00ca describes a circle around\npoint C on the rotation axis, separated from the rotation axis\nby i, and parameterised by the rotation phase \u03c6. The magnetic\n~ and V\n~ are in the planes\nlatitude of this vector is \u03b8E . The vectors U\nR\u0302-M\u0302 and R\u0302-\u00ca respectively; for their application, see section A1.\n\n\u03c0\n\u2212 \u03b8B\n2\ni\u2192\u03b4\n\n\u03b2\u2192\n\n\u03c6\u2192\u03c9\nTherefore the derivation of equation A2 in section A1\nalso demonstrates the correctness of equation 2:\ncos \u03c9 =\n\nsin \u03b8E \u2212 cos \u03b4 sin \u03b8B\nsin \u03b4 cos \u03b8B\n\n(A4)\n\nIn step (vi), we then wish to find the emission power P\nper solid angle \u03a9 in this direction. We may assume that the\nemission is evenly distributed around the cone (i.e. dP/d\u03c9\nis constant). If we differentiate equation A4 with respect to\n\u03b8E , we get:\ncos \u03b8E\nd\u03c9\n=\u2212\nd\u03b8E\ncos \u03b8B sin \u03b4 sin \u03c9\n\n(A5)\n\nThis allows us to obtain the distribution of emission\npower with magnetic latitude:\ndP\ndP d\u03c9\n=\nd\u03b8E\nd\u03c9 d\u03b8E\ncos \u03b8E\n\u221d\u2212\ncos \u03b8B sin \u03b4 sin \u03c9\n\n(as\n\ndP\nis constant)\nd\u03c9\n\n(A6)\n\nThe emission power per solid angle is related to this:\n1\n1\ndP\ndP\n=\nd\u03a9\n2\u03c0 cos \u03b8E d\u03b8E\n1\n\u221d\ncos \u03b8B sin \u03b4 sin \u03c9\n\n(A7)\n\nThis is the result used in step (vi) of section 3.4: equation 3.\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\f"}
