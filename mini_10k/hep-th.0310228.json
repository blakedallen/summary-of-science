Recent interest in studies of D-branes is the\nclassification of possible configurations in non-trivial backgrounds. Among other non-trivial\nbackgrounds, the maximally supersymmetric type IIB pp-wave background [3] has attracted\ngreat interests because the Green-Schwarz superstring on this background was shown to be\nexactly solvable [4, 5]. The configurations of D-branes on pp-wave backgrounds were examined\nin many works [6\u201322]. In particular, covariant analyses of D-branes of an open string in ppwaves were given in [14, 19] by applying a method developed by Lambert and West [23].\nIt is also possible to apply this method for analyzing Dirichlet branes of an open supermembrane. In the eleven-dimensional flat spacetime, Dirichlet p-branes were shown to be allowed\nfor the values p = 1, 5, 9 [24, 25]. The p = 5 case corresponds to M5-brane, while the p = 9\ncase describes the end-of-world 9-brane in the Horava-Witten theory [26]. Studies of open\nsupermembrane theories are expected to promote our understanding of features of M-branes.\nDirichlet branes of an open supermembrane on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave\nbackground (Kowalski-Glikman solution)\u2217 were classified in [30, 32]. In the work [32], we provided a covariant classification of the possible D-brane configurations by combining methods\nin Refs. [24, 25] and Ref. [23]. We found 1/2 supersymmetric M5-brane and 9-brane configurations sitting at the origin of the pp-wave. These configurations are not 1/2 supersymmetric\noutside the origin while 1-brane configurations are 1/2 supersymmetric at and outside the origin. Also, 1/2 supersymmetric 9-brane configurations obtained in Ref. [32] are expected to\nbe available for a study of a heterotic matrix model [33]. If we consider a double dimensional\nreduction of open supermembrane on the pp-wave background to a type IIA string theory [13]\nthrough a compactification of one of transverse dimensions, then M5- and 9-branes in eleven\ndimensions wrapping an S 1 -circle become possible configurations of D4-branes and D8-branes\nin the resulting type IIA pp-wave background [13,16,19,20]. This correspondence strongly supports the weak-strong duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory even in pp-wave\nbackgrounds, and thus we can say that a consistency of superstring theories on a pp-wave has\nbeen checked.\n\u2217\n\nIn our previous work [34], Dirichlet branes of an open supermembrane in the AdS4/7 \u00d7 S 7/4\nSupermembrane on the pp-wave background is related to the pp-wave matrix model [27] through the matrix\n\nregularization [28]. This relation in the pp-wave case is discussed in [29\u201331].\n\n1\n\n\fbackgrounds were examined, and possible configurations were classified. It was shown that\nunder the Penrose limit [35] possible Dirichlet branes are mapped one-to-one to those on the\npp-wave background, as expected from the fact that the Kowalski-Glikman solution [36] can\nbe obtained from the AdS4/7 \u00d7 S 7/4 backgrounds [37]. The allowed Dirichlet branes are also\nrelated to AdS branes in the AdS4/7 \u00d7 S 7/4 backgrounds.\n\nMotivated by our previous works [32, 34], we will consider D-branes of an AdS string by\n\nanalyzing the covariant Wess-Zumino term. First, we classify D-brane configurations of an open\nsuperstring in the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 background. The possible D-brane configurations can be compared\n\nto the AdS brane configurations. Secondly, we extend the covariant classification of D-branes\nin the pp-wave [14] by including the cases that the null directions (+, \u2212) are Dirichlet ones.\n\nThirdly, we examine Penrose limits of the possible D-branes in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background, and\ndirectly show that all of D-branes in the pp-wave are realized in these limits. In addition, we\npresent an example of 1/4 supersymmetric D-string configurations in the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 background,\n\nwhich preserves 1/4 supersymmetries even outside the origin. This configuration reduces to the\n1/4 supersymmetric D-string in the pp-wave background found in the work [14] through the\nPenrose limit. From the viewpoint of embedded branes in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background, this\nD-string may possibly correspond to R \u00d7 S 1 .\n\nThe organization of our paper is as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the action of an open\n\nsuperstring on the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background, and the covariant Wess-Zumino term is presented.\n\nIn section 3, we classify possible 1/2 supersymmetric D-brane configurations of the AdS string\nby investigating the vanishing conditions of the \u03ba-variation surface terms of the covariant WessZumino term. In addition, we find a 1/4 supersymmetric D-string configuration. This D-string\npreserves a quarter of supersymmetries both at and outside the origin. In section 4, we classify\nD-brane configurations preserving half of supersymmetries in the pp-wave background which\ninclude the cases that the null directions (+, \u2212) satisfy the Dirichlet conditions. In section 5 we\n\nconsider the Penrose limit of the result obtained in section 3. All of the resulting configurations\nafter the Penrose limit are shown to be included in the list presented in section 4. We also\ndiscuss the relation between our result and AdS branes in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. Section\n\n5 is devoted to a conclusion and discussions. In appendix A, our notation and convention are\nsummarized.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nCovariant Wess-Zumino Term for the AdS String\n\nIn this section, we will introduce the Green-Schwarz action of a superstring on the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nbackground (called AdS string below), and explain some characteristics relevant to our later\nconsiderations. In this paper, we do not utilize any specific gauges but discuss in a covariant\nfashion, because the covariant expression of the Wess-Zumino term is available for the covariant\nclassification of D-branes of the AdS string.\nFirst of all, the action of AdS string we consider is written as\nZ\nh\ni\np\nS =\nd2 \u03c3 LNG + LWZ , LNG = \u2212 \u2212g(X, \u03b8) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe Nambu-Goto part of this Lagrangian is represented in terms of the induced metric gij ,\nwhich is given by (For notation and convention, see Appendix A)\ngij = EiM EjN GM N = EiA EjB \u03b7AB ,\n\ng = det gij ,\n\nA\n,\nEiA = \u2202i Z M\u0302 EM\u0302\n\n(2.2)\n\nA\nare supervielbeins of the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. For D-strings,\nwhere Z M\u0302 = (X M , \u03b8\u1fb1 ) and EM\u0302\n\ng is replaced with det(gij + Fij ) where F is defined by F = dA \u2212 B with the Born-Infeld U(1)\n\ngauge field A and the pull-back of the NS-NS two-form B.\nThe Wess-Zumino term is described as\u2020\nLWZ = \u22122i\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\nb A \u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u03c3 E\nb,\ndt E\n\n(2.3)\n\nbA \u2261 E A (t\u03b8) and E\nb\u03b1 \u2261 E \u03b1 (t\u03b8). When we consider a fundamental string (F-string),\nwhere E\nthe matrix \u03c3 is given by \u03c33 . If we consider a D-string, then \u03c3 is represented by \u03c31 . Since we\n\nwould like to discuss boundary surfaces for both of fundamental string and D-string, we do not\nexplicitly fix \u03c3 in our consideration. It is known that \u03ba-invariance of the action is equivalent to\nsupergravity equations of motion [41, 42]. In the case of an open string, the \u03ba-variation leads\nto surface terms. One can show that the surface terms originating from SNG vanish, because\nA\n= \u03b4\u03ba E A = 0 , by using the definition of the \u03ba-variation \u03b4\u03ba E A = 0. In\nthey include \u03b4\u03ba Z M\u0302 EM\u0302\n\naddition, the \u03ba-variation of F does not lead to surface terms because \u03b4\u03ba F does not include a\n\nderivative of the \u03ba-variation of a field. Thus non-vanishing surface terms originate from SWZ\nonly.\n\u2020\n\nAlternative superstring actions have been proposed in [38] for superstrings in the AdS background and\n\nin [39, 40] for those in the pp-wave background.\n\n3\n\n\fIn this section, we consider an open string in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background.

The sketch of our strategy is as follows:\n\nWe will consider surface terms of \u03ba-variation of the above Wess-Zumino term, and investigate\n\nthe boundary conditions under which all of the surface terms vanish. Then these boundary\nconditions lead to a classification of possible D-branes. It is worth mentioning that the surface\nterms do not cancel out each other. Hence, without loss of generality, we can examine the\n\u03ba-variation of surface terms separately in each part.\n\u2021\n\nIt is expected that the fourth order analysis is sufficient as we will briefly comment later.\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nClassification of Supersymmetric D-branes of AdS String\n\nHere let us investigate the boundary conditions under which the \u03ba-invariance holds. Then we\nwill classify D-brane configurations preserving half of supersymmetries.\n3.1 Boundary Conditions of Covariant String\nBefore going to the concrete analysis, we need to introduce the boundary conditions. The openstring world-sheet \u03a3 has one-dimensional boundary \u2202\u03a3. We can impose the Neumann condition\nand Dirichlet condition on this boundary \u2202\u03a3. These boundary conditions are represented by\n\u2202n X A \u2261 \u2202n X M eA\nM = 0\n\n(Neumann condition) ,\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u2202t X A \u2261 \u2202t X M eM = 0\n\n(Dirichlet condition) ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nA\n\nwhere we have used the overline as Ai (i = 0, . . . , p) for the indices of Neumann coordinates\nand the underline as Aj (j = p + 1, . . . , 9) for the indices of Dirichlet coordinates. The operator\n\u2202t is a tangential derivative \u2202/\u2202\u03c4 and \u2202n is a normal derivative \u2202/\u2202\u03c3 on the boundary \u2202\u03a3,\nrespectively. We impose the boundary condition on the fermionic variable \u03b8:\nP \u00b1\u03b8 = \u03b8 ,\n\nP\u00b1 =\n\n1\n(I + M) .\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe gluing matrix M is a product of the SO(1, 9) gamma matrices tensored with Pauli matrices,\nand its concrete form will be fixed so that the \u03ba-variation surface terms vanish.\n3.2 D-branes of AdS Strings at the Origin\n0\nIn this subsection, we examine the \u03ba-variation of SWZ\n.

In order for this line to vanish, the following two conditions\nhave to be satisfied:\n\u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u03c3\u03b4\u03ba \u03b8 = 0\n\nand \u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u03b4\u03ba \u03b8 = 0 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe find that the condition (3.6) is satisfied if we define the projection operator (3.3) with gluing\nmatrices\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 m \u2297 i\u03c3 , d = 2 (mod 4) p = \u22121, 3, 7\n2\nM=\n,\n(3.7)\n\uf8f3 m \u2297 \u03c1 , d = 4 (mod 4) p = 1, 5, 9\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 for X 0 : Neumann\n\uf8f2 \u03c3 when \u03c3 = \u03c3\n1\n3\nm = s\u0393A1 * * * \u0393Ad , s =\n, \u03c1=\n,\n\uf8f3 i for X 0 : Dirichlet\n\uf8f3 \u03c33 when \u03c3 = \u03c31\n\nwhere the inclusion of the factor i for the case that the time direction X 0 is a Dirichlet one is\nequivalent to performing the Wick rotation and considering in the Euclidean formulation. This\nprocedure does not affect the analysis below. These conditions imply that, for the \u03c3 = \u03c33 case,\nDp-branes exist for the values p = \u22121, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, while if we consider the \u03c3 = \u03c31 case, then\n\nDp-branes with p = 1 and 5 are replaced with F1- and NS5-branes respectively\u00a7 . Hence, we\nobtain the well-known conditions for branes in type IIB string theory in flat spacetime. It is\nnot clear whether the S-duality holds for superstrings in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and pp-wave or not, but\n\nit should exist for branes even in these backgrounds. Therefore, we will discuss the D-string\ncase in parallel as well as the fundamental string in the following consideration.\nNext, we consider the second and third lines. Because these lines are proportional to the\nparameter \u03bb characterizing the AdS geometry, these give conditions intrinsic to the branes\n\nin the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. In order to make these lines vanish, we have to impose two\nadditional conditions:\n\nb i\u03c32 \u03b8 = 0 .\nb \u03c3i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8\u0304\u0393B \u0393\n\u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u0393\nB\nA\n\n(3.8)\n\nLet us classify the configurations satisfying the boundary conditions (3.8) .\nFor the d = 2 (mod 4) case, the conditions (3.8) are satisfied for the following case:\n\u2022 The number of Dirichlet directions in the AdS5 coordinates (X 0 , * * * , X 4 ) is even, and\n\u00a7\n\nthe same condition is also satisfied for the S 5 coordinates (X 5 , * * * , X 9 ).\n\nFor p = 9, the boundary condition is \u03b81 = \u03b82 when \u03c3 = \u03c33 , while \u03b82 = 0 when \u03c3 = \u03c31 .\n\n6\n\n\fOn the other hand, for the d = 4 (mod 4) case, the following conditions should be imposed:\n\u2022 The number of Dirichlet directions in the AdS5 coordinates (X 0 , * * * , X 4 ) is odd, and the\nsame condition is also satisfied for the S 5 coordinates (X 5 , * * * , X 9 ).\n\nThese conditions restrict the directions to which a brane world-volume can extend, while (3.6)\nrestricts the dimension of the world-volume. The D-brane configurations satisfying the conditions (3.6) and (3.8) are summarized in Tab. 1.\nD-instanton\n\nD-string\n\nD3-brane\n\nD5-brane\n\nD7-brane\n\nD9-brane\n\n(0,0)\n\n(0,2), (2,0)\n\n(1,3), (3,1)\n\n(2,4), (4,2)\n\n(3,5), (5,3)\n\nabsent\n\nTable 1: The possible 1/2 supersymmetric D-branes in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 sitting at the origin.\nWe found that D-strings are allowed to exist as 1/2 supersymmetric objects, which correspond to 1/2 supersymmetric D-strings in the pp-wave background as will be seen in section\n5. On the other hand, it is known that there exist 1/4 supersymmetric D-strings preserving 8\ndynamical supersymmetries in the pp-wave [14]. In subsection 3.4, we will present a 1/4 supersymmetric D-string which is the AdS origin of the 1/4 supersymmetric D-string found there.\nWe found that D9-branes are not allowed to exist. As will be seen in section 4, D9-branes are\nnot also allowed in the pp-wave [6, 7]. Since our discussion contains the cases that the time\ndirection satisfies the Dirichlet condition, we were able to find the D-instanton configuration.\nNotably, our result agrees with the classification of branes embedded in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nbackground (called AdS branes) [8], and thus all of D-branes obtained here possibly correspond\nto the AdS branes. Such a correspondence emerges in the case of Dirichlet branes of an\nopen supermembrane in the AdS4/7 \u00d7 S 7/4 backgrounds, where the classification of Dirichlet\nbranes [34] agrees with that of AdS branes obtained in [43].\n\n0\nWe have discussed the \u03ba-variation of SWZ\nuntil now. We have to take account of the \u03baspin\nM\nvariations of SWZ\nand SWZ\n. As we will see later, these parts have no effect on the above\n\nclassification at the origin. Therefore we can say that the classification of the possible D-brane\nconfigurations at the origin has been completely accomplished. For D-branes sitting outside\nspin\nM\nthe origin, the \u03ba-variation of SWZ\nleads to additional conditions. On the other hand, SWZ\ndoes\n\nnot affect the results in both at and outside the origin. The discussion concerning these points\nwill be given in the following subsection.\n7\n\n\f3.3 D-branes of AdS Strings outside the Origin\nspin\nspin\nHere we will consider the contribution of SWZ\npart.

This is because the homogeneity is not manifest in the coordinate system\nwe took here. The same situation emerges in the case of branes in the pp-wave. There, a flat\nbrane sitting at (outside) the origin of the Brinkmann coordinate system is mapped to a planer\n(less supersymmetric curved) brane in the Rosen coordinate system [9]. So, it is expected that\na 1/2 supersymmetric brane sitting outside the origin has a non-trivial shape in general. On\nthe other hand, we found that D-instantons are allowed to sit even outside the origin as in flat\nspacetime. This may be related to the fact that a D-instanton world-volume is a point in any\ncoordinate system. The same situation arises in the pp-wave case as we will see later.\nWe can expect less supersymmetric D-branes such as 1/4 supersymmetric D-branes to exist\neven outside the origin as discussed in Refs. [8, 9]. We will present this type of D-string later.\nM\nThe remaining task is to examine whether the SWZ\npart affects the classification at and\nM\noutside the origin or not. The \u03ba-variation of SWZ\nis given by\n#\nZ \"\n1\n\u03bb\nM\nb i\u03c32 \u03b8 * \u03b8\u0304\u0393B \u03b4\u03ba \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304\u0393 \u03c3\u0393BC \u03b8 * \u03b8\u0304\u0393\nb BC i\u03c32 \u03b4\u03ba \u03b8 dX A .\n\u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u03c3 \u0393\n\u03b4\u03ba SWZ\n=\nB\n12 \u2202\u03a3\n2 A\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe above surface terms vanish under the following conditions:\nb \u03c3i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8\u0304\u0393\nbBC i\u03c32 \u03b4\u03ba \u03b8 = 0 ,\n\u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u0393\nB\n\n(3.12)\n\n0\nwhich are nothing but those obtained in the analysis of the \u03ba-variation of the SWZ\npart. Thus\n0\nno new conditions arise, and hence the SWZ\npart has no effect on our classification.\n\n8\n\n\fAs a final remark in this section, we comment on higher order terms. Until now we have\nstudied the D-brane configurations up to and including fourth order in \u03b8 . We expect that the\nhigher order terms do not lead to any new additional conditions. In other words, the conditions\nwe have obtained in this paper are expected to be sufficient and all surface terms will vanish\nunder these conditions even in the full theory including all orders of \u03b8 . In fact, some arguments\nfor the higher order terms were given in Ref. [14].\n3.4 1/4 Supersymmetric D-string\nWe can obtain 1/4 supersymmetric D-branes in addition to those preserving half of supersymmetries. Here we present a configuration of 1/4 supersymmetric D-string as an example.\nSince we would like to study a D1-brane configuration, let us consider the following gluing\nmatrix:\nm \u2261 \u03931***8 .\n\nM = m \u2297 \u03c31 ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nin order to pass the conditions in flat space (3.6). This gluing matrix does not automatically\nsatisfy the conditions (3.8) specific to the AdS geometry, and so we need to impose additional\nconditions:\nb0 \u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 ,\n\u0393\n\nb9 \u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 .\n\u0393\n\n(3.14)\n\nHere it should be noted that the above two conditions are not independent because of the\ncondition \u03b8 = M\u03b8 . We can easily rewrite these conditions as\n\u03931***8 \u03b81 = \u03b81 ,\n\n\u03931***8 \u03b82 = \u03b82 .\n\n(3.15)\n\nBy the use of the relations \u0393+\u22121***8 = \u039311 and \u039311 \u03b81,2 = \u03b81,2 , we obtain\n\u0393\u2212 \u0393+ \u03b81 = 0 ,\n\n\u0393\u2212 \u0393+ \u03b82 = 0 .\n\n(3.16)\n(+)\n\n(\u2212)\n\nWhen the spinors \u03b81 and \u03b82 are decomposed as \u03b81,2 = 21 \u0393\u2212 \u0393+ \u03b81,2 + 12 \u0393+ \u0393\u2212 \u03b81,2 \u2261 \u03b81,2 + \u03b81,2 ,\n(+)\n\n(\u2212)\n\nthe conditions (3.16) implies \u03b81,2 = 0 and \u03b81,2 = \u03b81,2 . Finally, we obtain the expressions of\n\nadditional conditions:\n\u0393+ \u03b81 = \u0393+ \u03b82 = 0 .\n\n(3.17)\n\nThis condition reduces the number of the remaining supersymmetries, and the D-string configuration we considered here preserves quarter of supersymmetries.\n9\n\n\fM\nMoreover, we can see that the SWZ\npart has no effect on this D-string configuration since\n\nthe conditions derived from this part is identical with (3.8) . We can also check that the \u03baspin\nvariation of SWZ\nvanishes. The two conditions (3.10) ensure that the surface terms originating\nspin\nfrom the \u03ba-variation of SWZ\nvanish. By the use of the relation (\u03931***8 \u2297 I2 )\u03b8 = \u03b8, we can see\n\nthat the first one in (3.10) is satisfied, while the second one is not satisfied. However, the term\n\n\u03b8\u0304\u0393A \u03c3\u03b4\u03ba \u03b8 that couples to the second condition vanishes under the condition (\u03931***8 \u2297I2 )\u03b8 = \u03b8, and\nspin\nhence the surface terms from SWZ\nvanish. Thus, we have found a 1/4 supersymmetric D-string\n\nconfiguration in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. In particular, the supersymmetries preserved by\nthis configuration are not changed even if it is slid from the origin. If we consider the Penrose\n\nlimit of this D-string, then we can recover the D-string configuration originally found in the\nwork [14], which is 1/4 supersymmetric even outside the origin. The D-string in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nmight correspond to R \u00d7 S 1 mentioned in the works on the brane probe analysis given in [8]. It\nis an interesting future work to delve into other branes preserving 1/4 or less supersymmetries.\n\n4\n\nD-branes of PP-wave Strings Revisited\n\nIn this section we will discuss the classification of D-branes in the pp-wave background. In the\nwork [14], the allowed 1/2 supersymmetric D-brane configurations have been already classified\nfor the case that the light-cone directions (+, \u2212) satisfy the Neumann conditions, by using the\n\nsame method in this paper. Here we extend the discussion given in [14] by including the case\nthat (+, \u2212)-directions are the Dirichlet directions.

We found that\nthere exist transverse D-branes sitting at and outside the origin. D-instantons preserving half\nof supersymmetries are allowed to freely sit in the pp-wave as in flat space and AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\n\nD-instanton correspond to a point in the pp-wave spacetime while the existence of 1/2 super-\n\nsymmetric D-instantons sitting outside the origin seems to be consistent to the homogeneity of\nthe pp-wave geometry.\n\n5\n\nPenrose Limits of D-branes of AdS String\n\nIn this section we will consider Penrose limits [35] of the possible D-brane configurations in\nthe AdS background obtained in section 3, and show that all of the D-branes in the pp-wave\nobtained in section 4 is recovered as Penrose limits of those in the AdS background.\nThe Penrose limit is taken as follows. One makes a set of light-cone coordinate (X + , X \u2212 )\nfrom (X 0 , X 9 ),\u00b6 scales X + as X + \u2192 \u03a92 X + and then take the limit \u03a9 \u2192 0. We distinguish the\n\u00b6\n\nIf we make a pair of light-cone coordinates only in the AdS space or sphere, then flat spacetime is obtained\n\nas discussed in [37]. That is, in order to obtain the pp-wave background, we need to construct the lightcone coordinates by choosing one direction from the AdS coordinates and the other direction from the sphere\ncoordinates.\n\n14\n\n\fcases depending on the boundary conditions of the light-cone coordinate (X + , X \u2212 ) as (N, N)\nfor X \u00b1 \u2208 Neumann directions, and so on. For the fermionic coordinates, we scale \u03b8+ \u2192 \u03a9\u03b8+\n\nand take the limit \u03a9 \u2192 0. Some relevant aspects of the Penrose limit are explained in Appendix\n\nD.\n\nWe examine Penrose limits of (N,N)- and (D,D)-cases.\nPenrose Limit of D9-brane\nThere are no allowed 1/2 supersymmetric D9-brane configurations both in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and\n\nin the pp-wave. Hence, if we want to consider the correspondence of D9-branes in the AdS\n\nand those in the pp-wave, then we need to consider the less supersymmetric configurations of\nD9-branes.\nPenrose Limit of D7-brane\nThe possible D7-brane configurations are (3,5)- and (5,3)-branes. Now we cannot consider\n(D,D)-case since there is no Dirichlet direction in the S 5 and AdS5 , respectively.\nFirst, we consider the Penrose limit of the (3,5)-branes, whose boundary condition is s\u0393ab \u2297\n\ni\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 . In the (N,N)-case the resulting boundary condition after the Penrose limit is given\nby\ns\u0393ij \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 .\n\n(5.1)\n\nThat is, this configuration describes the (+,\u2212;2,4)-type D7-branes, which is included in the list\nof the allowed D-branes in the pp-wave case.\nIn the same way as in the (3,5)-brane case, we can investigate the Penrose limit of (5,3)branes. The boundary condition after the Penrose limit is\n\u2032 \u2032\n\ns\u0393i j \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhich is the (+, \u2212; 4, 2)-brane boundary condition in the pp-wave. Thus, two types of D7-\n\nbrane configurations in the pp-wave are rederived as the Penrose limit of D7-branes in the AdS\nbackground.\nPenrose Limit of D5-brane\nThe allowed D5-brane configurations are (2,4)- and (4,2)-branes.\n15\n\n\f\u2032\n\nFirst, we consider (2,4)-type D5-branes whose boundary condition is s\u0393a1 a2 a3 a \u2297 \u03c1\u03b8 = \u03b8\n\nwith \u03c1 = \u03c31 .

That is, we obtain (+, \u2212; 1, 3)-type D5-brane in the pp-wave. If we\ntake the (D,D)-condition, then we get the boundary condition:\ni\u0393+\u2212ij \u2297 \u03c1\u03b8 = \u03b8 ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nand hence (2,4)-type D5-branes are obtained. The resulting (+, \u2212; 1, 3)- and (2,4)-type D5branes are possible in the pp-wave case.\n\nSecondly, we study (4,2)-type D5-branes. In this case the boundary condition is given by\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ns\u0393aa1 a2 a3 \u2297 \u03c1\u03b8 = \u03b8 .

These\nconfigurations are also allowed in the pp-wave.\n\nIn the above discussion we have assumed the fundamental string case. It is also possible\nto consider the D-string by taking \u03c1 = \u03c33 , and simultaneously D5-branes are replaced with\nNS5-branes. The only difference in our consideration of the Penrose limit is only a choice of \u03c3\nand the discussion in the D-string case is exactly the same as the above one.\nPenrose Limit of D3-brane\nThe possible D3-brane configurations are (1,3)- and (3,1)-branes.\n\u2032 \u2032\n\nThe boundary condition of (1,3)-type D3-brane is given by s\u0393a1 ***a4 a b \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 , which\n\nbecomes, according to the choice of the light-cone coordinates,\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n\u0393i1 ***i4 i j \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8\n\u2032\n\ni\u0393+\u2212i1 i2 i3 i \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8\n\nfor (N,N)-case ,\nfor (D,D)-case .\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nWhen we consider the (3,1)-type D3-brane whose boundary condition is s\u0393aba1 ***a4 \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 ,\n16\n\n\fthe resulting conditions after taking the Penrose limit are given by\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393iji1 ***i4 \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8\n\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\ni\u0393+\u2212ii1 i2 i3 \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8\n\nfor (N,N)-case ,\nfor (D,D)-case .\n\nThus, we have obtained the D3-branes in the pp-wave as Penrose limits of D3-branes in the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background.\nPenrose Limit of D1-brane\nWe can take (0,2)- and (2,0)-branes as possible D1-brane configurations.

When we consider the (D,D)-type boundary condition, these conditions become, after taking the Penrose limit,\n\u2032 \u2032\n\ni\u0393+\u2212i1 ***i4 i j \u2297 \u03c1\u03b8 = \u03b8\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nand i\u0393+\u2212iji1 ***i4 \u2297 \u03c1\u03b8 = \u03b8 ,\n\n(5.6)\n\nand these conditions imply (0,2)- and (2,0)-type D-string configurations in the pp-wave, respectively. If we take \u03c1 = \u03c33 , then (0,2)- and (2,0)-type F-string configurations in the pp-wave are\nobtained.\nPenrose Limit of D-instanton\nIn this case we can consider the (D,D)-type boundary condition only. The condition for Dinstanton in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background is i\u039301***9 \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 . After taking the Penrose limit,\n\nwe obtain the following condition:\n\ni\u0393+\u22121***8 \u2297 i\u03c32 \u03b8 = \u03b8 .\nThis condition is nothing but that of D-instanton in the pp-wave.\nFinally, we summarize the results obtained above in Tab. 4.\n\n17\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fD7-branes\nAdS\n\u2193\n\n(3, 5)\n\nPenrose\n\npp-wave\n\n(5, 3)\n\nD2 \u0582\n\n\u0581 N2\n\nD2 \u0582\n\n\u0581 N2\n\n\u2212\n\n(+, \u2212; 2, 4)\n\n\u2212\n\n(+, \u2212; 4, 2)\n\nD5-branes\nAdS\n\u2193\n\n(2, 4)\n\nPenrose\n\npp-wave\n\n(4, 2)\n\nD2 \u0582\n\n\u0581 N2\n\nD2 \u0582\n\n\u0581 N2\n\n(2, 4)\n\n(+, \u2212; 1, 3)\n\n(4, 2)\n\n(+, \u2212; 3, 1)\n\nD3-branes\nAdS\n\u2193\n\n(1, 3)\n\nPenrose\n\npp-wave\n\n(3, 1)\n\nD2 \u0582\n\n\u0581 N2\n\nD2 \u0582\n\n\u0581 N2\n\n(1, 3)\n\n(+, \u2212; 0, 2)\n\n(3, 1)\n\n(+, \u2212; 2, 0)\n\nD1-branes\nAdS\n\u2193\n\nPenrose\n\npp-wave\n\n(0, 2)\nD2 \u0582\n(0, 2)\n\n\u0581 N2\n\u2212\n\n(2, 0)\nD2 \u0582\n(2, 0)\n\n\u0581 N2\n\u2212\n\n\u2212:We cannot take this boundary condition.\nTable 4: Penrose limit of D-branes of AdS string.\n\n18\n\n\fWe also briefly comment on (N,D)- or (D,N)-cases. If we consider the Penrose limit in these\ncases, the boundary condition becomes \u03b8\u2212 = 0 for every D-brane. This condition implies the\ntwo types of conditions as follows:\nM = \u0393+\u2212 \u2297 I2\n\nor M = \u03931***8 \u2297 I2 .\n\nHowever, the boundary conditions associated with these gluing matrices do not eliminate the\n\u03ba-variation surface terms. In fact, these matrices are not included in (4.3). It may be the case\nthat we may not take (N,D) and (D,N)-boundary conditions.\nPenrose Limit of 1/4 Supersymmetric D-string\nHere we will consider the Penrose limit of D-string configuration preserving quarter of supersymmetries. This D-string is a (1,1)-type D-string. When we consider the (N,N)-case, we\nobtain the (+, \u2212; 0, 0)-type D-string in the pp-wave. This D-string configuration is nothing but\n\nthe D-string found in the work [14]. If we take the (D,D)-boundary condition, we obtain the\n(1,1)-type D-string which is expected to be a 1/4 supersymmetric D-string in the pp-wave.\n\n6\n\nConclusion and Discussion\n\nWe have classified possible configurations of D-branes of a superstring in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 back-\n\nground. In contrast to the pp-wave case, the D-string configuration is realized as a usual\n1/2 supersymmetric configuration. Notably, our classification result agrees with that of AdS\nbrane configurations of the brane probe analysis. We have also extended the classification of\nallowed 1/2 supersymmetric D-branes in the pp-wave [14] by including the case that both of\nlight-cone directions satisfy the Dirichlet conditions. In particular, we have found that 1/2\nsupersymmetric D-instantons can exist at and outside the origin in both AdS and pp-wave\nbackgrounds. The fact that D-instanton can survive even outside the origin seems to reflect\nthe homogeneity of these backgrounds. In addition, we have investigated Penrose limits of\nthe allowed D-branes in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background, and it has been shown that possible 1/2\nsupersymmetric configurations in the pp-wave case can be recovered as Penrose limits of those\n\nin the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\n\nWe have mainly examined the standard configurations preserving half of supersymmetries,\n\nbut it is interesting to approach 1/4 or less supersymmetric D-branes of AdS string in our\n19\n\n\fcovariant formulation. In fact, as an example, we have presented a 1/4 supersymmetric Dstring configuration in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. This configuration has been shown to reduce\n\nto the 1/4 supersymmetric D-string in the pp-wave preserving 8 dynamical supersymmetries.\n\nD-branes of this type are called D+ -branes in the works [8]. On the other hand, the standard\nD-branes are called D\u2212 -branes. In this paper we have clarified the AdS origin of D\u2212 -branes. It\nmay be possible to find the AdS origin of D+ -branes. Of course, we can also seek for the AdS\norigin of oblique D-branes, curved D-branes and intersections of D-branes in the pp-wave case\n(For a work in this direction, [44]). In addition, giant gravitonsk or baryon vertex operators\nmay be investigated in our covariant formulation if we treat these objects in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 by\nthe use of our formulation. It is also interesting to examine Dirichlet boundaries of an open\nD3-brane constructed in [46] and compare the result with that obtained here. Another direction\nis to study D-branes on other AdS backgrounds such as AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 /ZN and AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 [47].\n\nWe will report all of these problems in another place in the near future [48].\n\nIt is also an interesting problem to apply our results to defect conformal field theories\nvia the AdS/CFT correspondence [49]. Recall that a stringy nature in pp-wave string theories\nplayed an important role in studies of the AdS/CFT correspondence at the stringy level beyond\nsupergravity approximation [27]. Our classification results and our methods are expected to\npromote the understanding of AdS/CFT correspondence.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Machiko Hatsuda and Katsuyuki Sugiyama for useful discussion.\n\nAppendix\nA\n\nNotation and Convention\n\nIn this place we will summarize miscellaneous notation and convention used in this paper.\nk\n\nThe matrix model on the pp-wave also has supersymmetric fuzzy sphere solutions (giant graviton) [27].\n\nGiant gravitons in the pp-wave matrix model are discussed in [29, 45].\n\n20\n\n\fNotation of Coordinates\nFor the superstring in the ten-dimensional curved space-time: AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and pp-wave backgrounds, we use the following notation of supercoordinates for its superspace (X M , \u03b8\u1fb1 ):\nM = (\u03bc, \u03bc\u2032) ,\n\n\u03bc = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) \u2208 AdS5 ,\n\n\u03bc\u2032 = (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) \u2208 S 5 ,\n\nand the background metric is expressed by GM N . The coordinates in the Lorentz frame are\ndenoted by (X A , \u03b8\u03b1 ):\nA = (a, a\u2032 ) ,\n\na = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,\n\nA = (+, \u2212, i, i\u2032 ) ,\n\ni =, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,\n\na\u2032 = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 for AdS case ,\ni\u2032 = 5, 6, 7, 8,\n\nm = (i, i\u2032 ) for pp-wave case ,\n\nand its metric is described by \u03b7AB = diag(\u22121, +1, . . . , +1) with \u03b700 = \u22121. The light-cone coordinates are defined by X \u00b1 \u2261\n\n\u221a1 (X 9\n2\n\n\u00b1 X 0 ) . The coordinates of world-sheet are parameterized\n\nby (\u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 ) = (\u03c4, \u03c3) . The induced metric on the world-sheet is represented by gij (i, j = 1, 2) .\nSO(1,9) Gamma Matrices\n\nWe denote two 16-component Majorana-Weyl spinors as \u03b81 and \u03b82 , and the SO(1, 9) Clifford\nalgebra is written as\n{\u0393A , \u0393B } = 2\u03b7 AB ,\n\n{\u0393M , \u0393N } = 2GM N ,\n\nM\n\u0393A \u2261 eA\nM\u0393 ,\n\nA\n\u0393M \u2261 eM\nA\u0393 ,\n\nwhere the light-cone components of the SO(1, 9) gamma matrices are\n1\n\u0393\u00b1 = \u221a (\u03939 \u00b1 \u03930 ) ,\n2\n\n{\u0393+ , \u0393\u2212 } = 2I16 .\n\nThe chirality operator and the Dirac conjugate are defined as\n\u039311 \u2261 \u03930***9 ,\n\n\u03b8\u0304 \u2261 \u03b8T C ,\n\nwhere the charge conjugation matrix C satisfies the relations:\nC T = \u2212C ,\n\nC \u22121 (\u0393M )T C = \u2212\u0393M .\n\nIn this paper we mainly use the 32-component representation \u03b8T = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) .\n\n21\n\n\fB\n\nCoset Construction of Supervielbein in the AdS5\u00d7S5\n\nHere we will briefly review the coset construction of supervielbein in the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 background.\n\nThe super-AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 -algebra is regarded as su(2, 2|4), and the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 manifold can be\n\nconstructed as a coset SU(2, 2|4)/ (SO(1, 4) \u00d7 SO(5)).\n\nThe bosonic part of the super AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 -algebra is so(2, 4) \u00d7 so(6) given by\n[Pa , Pb ] = \u03bb2 Mab ,\n[Pa , Mbc ] = \u03b7ab Pc \u2212 \u03b7ac Pb ,\n[Mab , Mcd ] = \u03b7bc Mad + 3 terms ,\n\n[Pa\u2032 , Pb\u2032 ] = \u2212\u03bb2 Ma\u2032 b\u2032 ,\n[Pa\u2032 , Mb\u2032 c\u2032 ] = \u03b7a\u2032 b\u2032 Pc\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7a\u2032 c\u2032 Pb\u2032 ,\n[Ma\u2032 b\u2032 , Mc\u2032 d\u2032 ] = \u03b7b\u2032 c\u2032 Ma\u2032 d\u2032 + 3 terms .\n\nThe parameter \u03bb characterizes the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometry, and if we take the limit \u03bb \u2192 0 then\nthe geometry reduces to the ten-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.\n\nNow we decompose the SO(1, 9) gamma matrices \u0393A 's as follows:\n\u0393a = \u03b3 a \u2297 I \u2297 \u03c41\n\u2032\n\n(a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) ,\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393a = I \u2297 \u03b3 a \u2297 \u03c42\n\n(a\u2032 = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) ,\n\n\u039311 = \u03930 * * * \u03939 = I \u2297 I \u2297 \u03c43 ,\nwhere the 2 \u00d7 2 matrices \u03c4i 's are the standard Pauli matrices. The gamma matrices of the AdS5\npart \u03b3 a 's are\n\n\u03b3 i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3) and \u03b3 4 \u2261 i\u03b30123\n\u2032\n\nand hence (\u03b3 4 )2 = 1 and i\u03b301234 = +1. For the gamma matrices of the S 5 part \u03b3 a 's, we use\n\u2032\n\n\u03b3 i (i\u2032 = 5, 6, 7, 8) and \u03b3 9 \u2261 \u03b35678 ,\nand then \u03b3 56789 = +1. The charge conjugation matrix C is defined as\nC \u2261 C \u2297 C \u2032 \u2297 i\u03c42 ,\nwhere C and C \u2032 are the charge conjugation matrices in the AdS5 and S 5 , respectively.

The Penrose limit is taken by rescaling coordinates as\nX + \u2192 \u03a92 X + , X m \u2192 \u03a9X m , \u03b8+ \u2192 \u03a9\u03b8+ ,\nwhere \u03b8+ is defined by \u03b8+ = P+ \u03b8 with P+ = 21 \u0393+ \u0393\u2212 , and then by bringing \u03a9 to zero. After the\n\nPenrose limit, the scale \u03bb of AdS5 or S 5 can be regarded as the scale \u03bc of the pp-wave\u2217\u2217 . Noting\nthat the super-pp-wave algebra is an Inonu-Wigner contraction of the super-AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 algebra\n[51], the Penrose limit of the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 group manifold parameterized by gx = eX\nturns to be the pp-wave group manifold parameterized by gx = eX\n\n+P\n\n+ +X\n\n\u2212P\n\n\u2212 +X\n\nmP\n\naP\n\nm\n\na +X\n\na\u2032 P\n\na\u2032\n\n.
