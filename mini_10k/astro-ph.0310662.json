INTRODUCTION\n\nComputer simulations are becoming more and more\npopular. They allow investigations of physics on office\ndesks rather than explorations through hands-on experiments (This does not imply a transition from hard work\nto gaming). In the industrial context, the two approaches\nare not separable: the computer codes have to be validated. After a computer design has been completed,\nits relation to reality will inevitably be assessed in the\nmanufacture and evaluation of prototypes. How about\nthe growing importance of computer simulations in astrophysics - where are the measurements found to test\naspects of a complex computer code in idealized setups,\nand where are the prototypes that validate the quality\nof the results in the targeted application? The first step\nof code development is accompanied by the verification\nof partial aspects of the code in simplified test problems\nwhere the solution is analytically known. The code can\nbe improved step by step. Additionally, laboratory experiments may be used to further verify the code with\naccurate measurements in idealized setups. The transition to code validation is made when its capability to\nhandle complicated coupled processes is tested and the\ncompleteness of the physical description is evaluated. In\nthe industrial context, this is achieved by more comprehensive experiments and measurements, or, ultimately,\nby the comparison of computer designs with the prop1 CITA, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H8,\nCanada\n2 Physics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge,\nTennessee 37831-6354\n3 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996-1200\n4 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik, Karl-SchwarzschildStrasse 1, D-85741 Garching, Germany\n\nerties of manufactured prototypes. We would now be\ntempted to relate the validation of computer generated\nresults with real life prototypes in manufacturing to the\ncomparison of astrophysical simulations with astronomical observations. This would, however, circumvent the\ngoal of astrophysical simulations: One does not assume\nunknown physics in industrial design. Perfect agreement\nbetween a computer simulation and the behavior of a\nprototype can indeed be seen as proof of the quality of\nthe computer code. The situation is different in astrophysics, where the understanding of the physics of an\nevent is rather the goal than the ingredient. The comparison between simulation and observation is essential\nto demonstrate the physical understanding of the event,\nit cannot at the same time be used to qualify code performance. The gap in code validation between detached\nanalytical test calculations and the astrophysical application can be bridged by code comparisons (Calder et al.\n2002), based on the assumption that different numerical approaches are likely to show different strengths and\nweaknesses in simulations of complex physical systems.\nDifferences in the simulation results are an indicator for\nuncertainties in the numerical methods.\nIn the present paper we document the detailed comparison of results from different supernova codes. Both\nof our codes aim to provide a solution to the Boltzmann\nneutrino transport equation in spherical symmetry.\nThis is achieved by fundamentally different numerical\nmethods: The code of the Oak Ridge-Basel group\n(agile-boltztran) consists of a general relativistic\ntime-implicit discrete-angle (SN ) Boltzmann solver,\nwhich is coupled in an operator split fashion to a general\nrelativistic time-implicit hydrodynamics solver with a\ndynamical adaptive grid. It implements a direct finite\ndifference representation of the Boltzmann equation\n\n\f2\n(Mezzacappa & Bruenn 1993a; Mezzacappa & Messer\n1999; Liebend\u00f6rfer, Rosswog, & Thielemann\n2002;\nLiebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2004). The Garching code, vertex,\nis a one-dimensional version of a program that was\ndeveloped to perform multi-dimensional supernova\nsimulations with accurate ray-by-ray neutrino transport.\nIt is based on the explicit, moving-grid, finite-volume\nhydrodynamics code prometheus, which employs a\nRiemann solver for constructing the solution of the\nhydrodynamics equations. The neutrino transport is\nhandled in an operator-split step and is calculated by\na variable Eddington factor closure of neutrino energy,\nnumber, and momentum equations, where the variable\nEddington factor is derived from the formal solution\nof a spherically averaged model Boltzmann equation\n(Rampp & Janka 2002). In spherical symmetry, there\nis only one \"ray\" for the solution of the moments\nequations and no spherical averaging is necessary for the\nmodel Boltzmann equation. Therefore, a convergence\nin the iterations between the moments equations and\nthe closure from the model Boltzmann equation provides in spherical symmetry a solution of the complete\nBoltzmann equation.\nThis work has two main goals. (i) The direct comparison of two codes applied to the same challenging astrophysical scenario with concerted physics (spherical symmetry, progenitor models, nuclear and weak interaction\nphysics, general relativistic effects). (ii) The production\nof reference results to test future supernova codes in the\nspherical limit. Machine-readable data files are included\nin the electronic edition of the Journal.\nNeutrinos play a crucial role in collapsing cores of massive stars. The loss of electron lepton number by the\nproduction and escape of electron neutrinos determines\nthe collapse dynamics and the position where the supernova shock forms. Energy and lepton number transport by neutrino diffusion also govern the evolution of\nthe nascent neutron star. The energy transfer by neutrinos to the medium that surrounds the protoneutron\nstar may revive the stalled accretion front and thus drive\na delayed explosion (Wilson 1985; Bethe & Wilson\n1985). Neutrino interactions moreover set the protonto-nucleon ratio and therefore the conditions for nucleosynthesis in the innermost supernova ejecta. Sustained energy deposition near the protoneutron star surface causes a post-explosion outflow of baryonic matter,\nthe so-called neutrino-driven wind, which is discussed\nas a potential site for the formation of r-process elements (Woosley et al. 1994; Takahashi, Witti, & Janka\n1994; Sumiyoshi et al. 2000; Wanajo et al. 2001;\nThompson, Burrows, & Meyer 2001).\nDeep inside the protoneutron star the absorption and\nscattering mean free paths of neutrinos are very small\nand therefore neutrinos diffuse and are in chemical equilibrium with the stellar plasma. With decreasing density\nthe neutrino interaction lengths become larger, before, finally the neutrinos can stream freely. Since the reaction\ncross sections rise steeply with the neutrino energy, lowenergy neutrinos decouple from the stellar background at\nhigher densities. Most electron flavor neutrinos emerge\nfrom the accreting material at the base of the cooling region under semi-transparent conditions and propagate to\nthe heating region where their angular distribution influences the energy deposition behind the accretion front.\n\nNeither diffusion nor free streaming is a good approximation in this important region where neutrinos strongly\ncouple the dynamics of different layers on a short propagation time scale.\nAn accurate treatment of the neutrino transport\nand of neutrino-matter interactions therefore requires\nthe combination of neutrino sources at one location with neutrino opacities at other locations as described by the energy- and angle-dependent Boltzmann transport equation. The solution of the Boltzmann equation is also desirable to test approximations, the most elaborate of which are certainly multigroup flux-limited diffusion (Bruenn 1985; Myra et al\n1987; Bruenn, DeNisco, & Mezzacappa 2001) and twomoment closure schemes (Bludman & Cernohorsky\n1995; Smit, Cernohorsky, & Dullemond 1997). With\nthe growing computer capability it has become feasible\nto provide solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation\nnot only for the collapse phase (Mezzacappa & Bruenn\n1993a), but also in consistent dynamical simulations\nof the post-bounce evolution (Rampp & Janka 2000;\nMezzacappa et al. 2001; Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2001;\nThompson, Burrows, & Pinto 2003).\nThe paper is organized as follows. We will describe\nin Sect. 2 the stellar models and the physical ingredients\nthat constitute the problem to be solved by our numerical\nmethods. In Sect. 3 we will briefly resume characteristic features and capabilities of both neutrino radiationhydrodynamics codes. In Sect. 4 our results for the two\nconsidered stellar models will be discussed with special\nfocus on the differences between the runs. In Sect. 5 we\nshall summarize our findings and draw conclusions.\n2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL\n2.1. Progenitors\n\nWe present in this paper two different models. One\nof them includes only the most essential physical ingredients; e.g., the transport of electron flavor neutrinos\nand antineutrinos, but not the heavy-lepton neutrinos\nand antineutrinos. It is meant to serve as a guideline\nfor future code development and transport approximations. The model is based on a 13 M\u2299 progenitor of\nNomoto & Hashimoto (1988). The 13 M\u2299 progenitor\nmodel has a tradition in supernova simulations, its exceptionally small iron core sustained the hope to produce prompt explosions. We call this run N13, as it is\nbased on Newtonian gravity. A second run was launched\nfrom a 15 M\u2299 progenitor of Woosley & Weaver (1995).\nThis progenitor has been widely used in supernova investigations, as it provides a model of a massive star in\nthe middle of the mass range that is expected to end its\nlife in a supernova. The run takes into account all neutrino flavors with \"standard\" input physics as listed in\nBruenn (1985). General relativistic effects are included\nin this physically more complete run, G15, and the input\nphysics has been extended by ion-ion correlations and\nnucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung.\n2.2. Radiation Hydrodynamics in Spherical Symmetry\n\nThe stellar progenitor model is evolved in time by\nmeans of the hydrodynamics and neutrino transport\nequations. Since there is no danger of grid entangling in spherical symmetry, we make use of the free-\n\n\f3\ndom in agile-boltztran to choose orthogonal comoving space-time coordinates and describe the interactions\nin the collision term in the most convenient comoving frame for the neutrino four-momentum (see e.g.,\nCardall & Mezzacappa (2003) for a generalized discussion of coordinate choices for the radiation transport).\nIn the metric of Misner & Sharp (1964); May & White\n(1966),\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0001\n1 \u2202r\n2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212\u03b1 (cdt) +\nda2 +r2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\u0393 \u2202a\n(1)\nthe equations of hydrodynamics in spherical\nsymmetry in the presence of a radiation field\ncan be written in the form (Lindquist 1966;\nLiebend\u00f6rfer, Mezzacappa, & Thielemann 2001)\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0003\n\u2202 \u0002\n\u2202 \u0393\n=\n4\u03c0r2 \u03b1u\n(2)\n\u2202t \u03c1\n\u2202a\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u2202\ne+J\nuH\n\u0393 1+\n+\n=\n\u2202t\nc2\nc4\n\u0003\n\u2202 \u0002\n\u2212 2\n4\u03c0r2 \u03b1 (up + u\u03c1K + \u0393\u03c1H)\n(3)\n\u0014 \u0012c \u2202a\n\u0013\n\u0015\ne+J\n\u0393H\n\u2202\nu 1+ 2\n+ 2 =\n\u2202t\nc\nc\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nu\u03c1H\n\u2202\n4\u03c0r2 \u03b1 \u0393p + \u0393\u03c1K + 2\n\u2212\n\u2202a\nc\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\ne + 3p/\u03c1 + J + 3K Gm\n\u03b1\n1+\n\u2212\nr\nc2\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2Gm\np\n\u2212 1\u2212\n(J\n\u2212\n3K)\n\u2212\n2\n+\nK\nrc2\n\u03c1\n\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\ne\n+\nJ\n\u03c1H 2\nG\n1+\n(p\n+\n\u03c1K)\n\u2212\n(4)\n+ 8\u03c0r2 2\nc\nc2\nc4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0393\n\u2202 4\u03c0 3\nr =\n(5)\n\u2202a 3\n\u03c1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202m\nuH\ne+J\n+ 4\n(6)\n=\u0393 1+\n2\n\u2202a\nc\nc\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 H\n\u2202\n=\n\u2202t 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1 c4\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne + J \u2202\u03b1\n1 \u2202\n\u2212 1+ 2\n\u2212 2\n[\u03b1 (p + \u03c1K)]\nc\n\u2202a\n\u03c1c \u2202a\n\u03b1\u0393\n(J \u2212 3K) .\n(7)\n+\n4\u03c0r3 \u03c1c2\nThe metric is based on an enclosed baryon mass label,\na, and a coordinate time, t. Itprefers to the areal radius,\nr, the \"Lorentz\" factor, \u0393 = 1 + (u/c)2 \u2212 2Gm/(rc2 ),\nand the lapse function, \u03b1. The angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 describe a\ntwo-sphere. The quantity u = \u03b1\u22121 \u2202r/\u2202t takes the place\nof a fluid velocity and m is the enclosed gravitational\nmass, proportional to the enclosed total energy. Both of\nour codes split these equations into hydrodynamics equations and transport equations. vertex employs Eulerian\ncoordinates which can be obtained by a coordinate transformation. The fluid is specified in its rest frame by the\nrest mass density, \u03c1, specific internal energy, e, and electron number fraction, Ye , for which an additional evolution equation (lepton number conservation) is solved.\n\nThe hydrodynamics equations are closed by the equation of state, which gives the pressure, p, as a function\nof density, internal energy, and electron number. The\nzeroth, J, first, H/c, and second, K, angular moment of\nthe monochromatic neutrino intensity (normalized by the\nrest-mass density) are determined by the transport equation which includes the interactions listed in Table 1 in\nthe collision integral. Eq. (7) determines the lapse function. Eq. (6) allows us to integrate outward from a = 0\nto obtain the total energy; it translates to the Poisson\nequation in the Newtonian limit. Eq. (5) defines the general relativistic analogue to the Newtonian volume. Eq.\n(4) describes the change of radial momentum; to leading\norder it is proportional to \u2212Gm/(cr)2 + (J \u2212 3K)/r. Eq.\n(3) describes the evolution of the total energy. Note that\nthere are no contributions from terms of zeroth and first\norder in c. Eq. (2) relates the evolution of the specific\nvolume to the divergence of the velocity field.\n2.3. Nuclear and Weak Interaction Physics Input\nThe equation of state describes the thermodynamic\nstate of a fluid element based on density, \u03c1, temperature, T , and the composition. The relation between the\nspecific internal energy and the pressure closes the system of hydrodynamics equations. For this comparison we\nuse the equation of state of Lattimer & Swesty (1991).\nIt assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium and is based\non a liquid drop model for a representative nucleus with\natomic number A and charge Z, surrounded by free alpha particles, protons, and neutrons. These baryons are\nimmersed in an electron and positron gas that equilibrates with a photon gas by the pair creation process.\nThe incompressibility modulus can be adjusted. We use\na value of K = 180 MeV. Above nuclear density, where\nno isolated individual nuclei are present, the transition\nto a proton-neutron-electron gas is made by a Maxwell\nphase transition. In any of these cases, the nuclear composition at given temperature and density is determined\nby the specification of the electron fraction Ye . At low\ndensities/temperatures the vertex code switches to an\nequation of state that considers electrons, positrons, photons, nucleons and nuclei consistent with the composition\nused in the progenitor model (Rampp & Janka 2002).\nThe switch is triggered in N13 and G15 by a density\nthreshold of \u03c1 < 6 \u00d7 107 g/cm3 . agile-boltztran applies the same switch in the run N13, but considers in the\nlow density domain only one nucleus, 28 Si. In run G15,\nsilicon is converted to NSE under energy conservation at\na burning temperature of 0.44 MeV (Mezzacappa et al.\n2001).\nAs for the neutrino-matter interactions, we have chosen to use the conventional (\"standard\") opacities, i.e.,\na description which follows closely the one detailed by\nBruenn (1985); Mezzacappa & Bruenn (1993c). Note,\nhowever, that there are small differences in the neutrino\ndescription employed by the two groups. While agileboltztran treats the \u03bc/\u03c4 neutrinos and antineutrinos\nseparately, they are combined to one species in vertex.\nIn order to save computer time, usually only electron\nneutrinos are considered in the vertex calculations during the core collapse phase. Tests have shown that taking\ninto account also electron antineutrinos and the heavylepton neutrinos leads to only minuscule differences in\nthis phase of the supernova evolution (their inclusion in\n\n\f4\nTable 1\nOverview of all neutrino-matter interactions\nconsidered in the N13 runs.\nReactiona\n\u03bdA \u21cb \u03bdA\n\u03bdN \u21cb \u03bdN\n\u03bde n \u21cb e\u2212 p\n\u03bd\u0304e p \u21cb e+ n\n\u03bde A\u2032 \u21cb e\u2212 A\n\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 \u21cb e\u2212 e+\n\u03bde\u00b1 \u21cb \u03bde\u00b1\n\nReference\nBruenn (1985) (no ion-ion correlations!)\nBruenn (1985); Mezzacappa & Bruenn (1993c)\nBruenn (1985); Mezzacappa & Bruenn (1993c)\nBruenn (1985); Mezzacappa & Bruenn (1993c)\nBruenn (1985); Mezzacappa & Bruenn (1993c)\nBruenn (1985)\nMezzacappa & Bruenn (1993c);\nCernohorsky (1994)\na In the first column the symbol \u03bd represents any of the neutrinos \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e (heavy-lepton neutrinos are neglected in N13).

The references point to papers where information can be found about the approximations employed in the rate\ncalculations. Details about the numerical implementation can be\nfound in the methodical papers of Rampp & Janka (2002) and\nMezzacappa & Messer (1999); Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. (2004), respectively. The G15 runs additionally include reactions with \u03bc- and\n\u03c4 -neutrinos and their antiparticles, ion-ion correlation effects in\nneutrino-nuclei interactions, and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung.\n\nthe postbounce phase, however, is important as demonstrated by the comparison between models N13 and G15\nin Sect. 4). The Garching group routinely includes\nnucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung as a source (or sink) for\nneutrino-antineutrino pairs. The decrease of coherent\nneutrino scattering off heavy ions due to ion-ion correlations and electron screening (Itoh 1975; Horowitz\n1997; Bruenn & Mezzacappa 1997) is also taken into account. These improvements have been switched off in\nthe N13 models and added to agile-boltztran such\nthat they are consistently included in both G15 runs.\nIn both codes, the implementation of the ion-ion correlations has been updated with the structure function given\nin Itoh et al. (2004). Because of the large mass contrast\nbetween species with A \u2264 4 and the representative heavy\nnucleus we omit the somewhat arbitrary averaging of the\neffect over species and consider only the representative\nnucleus for the calculation of the ion separation.\n3. NUMERICAL METHODS\n\nThe two codes follow very different approaches to evaluate the radiation moments J, H, and K. Contrary to\nflux-limiting and \"gray\" transport methods, neither of\nour methods needs to make assumptions about the angular or the spectral distribution of the radiation field.\nImportant features and implementation details of the two\ncodes are summarized in the following subsections.\n3.1. agile-boltztran\n\nThe concept and first implementation of boltztran has been developed in Mezzacappa & Bruenn\n(1993a,b,c) for core collapse simulations in the order\nv/c approximation. Essential for the computational\nefficiency of the implicit scheme is the storage of the interactions in a dynamical table which delivers consistent\nderivatives of all cross sections and thermodynamical\nquantities for the Newton-Raphson iterations in the solution of the nonlinear equations (Mezzacappa & Messer\n1999; Messer 2000). For the highly dynamical situation\nafter bounce, boltztran has been coupled to the\n\nhydrodynamics code agile. The finite differencing has\nbeen revised for energy conservation and extended to\nsolve the general relativistic Eqs. (2-8) (Liebend\u00f6rfer\n2000; Liebend\u00f6rfer, Rosswog, & Thielemann\n2002;\nLiebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2004).\n3.1.1. Hydrodynamics\n\nThe hydrodynamics part of the Lagrangian Eqs. (2-7)\nis solved by implicit conservative finite differencing. One\nstrength is the implementation of a dynamically moving\nadaptive grid following Winkler, Norman, & Mihalas\n(1984) and Dorfi & Drury (1987). In the general relativistic extension, it is equivalent to a resolutiondependent choice of shift vectors, that allow a continuous\ncoordinate translation in the radial direction during the\nevolution of the model. Artificial viscosity has been included in a consistent, but causality violating manner\nbased on the tensor viscosity of Tscharnuter & Winkler\n(1979). It provides the mechanism for energy dissipation\nin the shock front and defines the shock width such that\nthe number of attracted adaptive grid points does not\ngrow beyond limits. A major advantage of the adaptive\ngrid is the dynamical allocation of computational zones\nto regions where they are needed. The zoning for hydrodynamics and neutrino transport is always kept congruent for consistency reasons. During the evolution of\nthe model, one group of grid points follows the accretion\nfront, while another resolves the steep density gradient\nbetween the outer layers of the protoneutron star and the\ninfalling matter, where most of the electron flavor neutrinos stream away. The use of artificial viscosity is not\na disadvantage of the method, as it only plays a minor\nlocal role in stabilizing the shock front (the shock width\nis set to a few percent of the shock radius and captured\nby \u223c 10 moving grid points). A disadvantage of the\nadaptive grid approach in an earlier implementation (see\nLiebend\u00f6rfer, Rosswog, & Thielemann (2002) for a detailed description) is the numerical diffusion introduced\nby the first-order advection in regions where the adaptive\ngrid does not concentrate its zones, e.g. in a rarefaction\nwave or at sharp discontinuities of the composition. During this comparison, improvement has been achieved by\nupgrading agile with second order total variation diminishing (TVD) advection based on a Van Leer flux\nlimiter.\n3.1.2.

The evolved quantity\n\n\f5\nis the neutrino distribution function, F (t, a, \u03bc, E), as a\nfunction of time t, rest mass a enclosed in a sphere at radius r, propagation angle cosine \u03bc with respect to radial\ndirection, and neutrino energy E. Neutrinos in specific\nbeams are created and destroyed according to the collision term, C, which includes the interactions listed in\nTable 1. It is assumed that the neutrinos propagate freely\nbetween interactions. The free-particle motion along\ngeodesics between collisions introduces the many correction terms apparent on the right hand side of Eq. (8).\nThey stem from the use of spherical coordinates in combination with a description of the neutrino phase space in\na comoving frame. Nevertheless, all terms can be labeled\nwith a physical effect. In order of appearance in Eq. (8)\nthese are, the time derivative of the neutrino distribution\nfunction, the propagation of neutrinos, the angle correction due to neutrino propagation, the angular aberration\ncorrection due to observer motion, the frequency shift in\nthe gravitational potential, and the Doppler frequency\nshift due to observer motion. It is essential for the successful finite difference representation of Eq. (8) that\nit is upward compatible with simple special cases of the\ntransport equation. Basic physical properties can be determined by the evaluation of expectation values with\nthe neutrino distribution functions for various operators.\nThe finite difference representation should support, e.g.,\nthe diffusion limit, total energy conservation, and the\nconservation of lepton number.\n3.1.3. Parameter settings\n\nBoth runs, N13 and G15, were performed with 103\nadaptive spatial zones ranging from the center of the\nprogenitor star to about 7000 km. A constant pressure\nboundary condition was used at the barely moving surface. The neutrino energy was resolved with 20 geometrically increasing energy groups, the first centered at 3\nMeV and the last at 300 MeV. The propagation angle\nhas been discretized with 6 angles suitable for Gaussian\nquadrature. Roughly 3000 time steps have been used for\ncollapse and 7000 for the postbounce phase. The run\nN13 has been evolved with an order v/c approximation\nof Eqs. (2-8) and run G15 with the general relativistic\nequations.\n3.2. vertex\n\nIndependently from the efforts of the Oak RidgeBasel collaboration the Garching supernova group has\ntreated the Boltzmann transport problem for neutrinos in core-collapse supernovae with a new variable Eddington factor method (Rampp 2000; Rampp & Janka\n2000, 2002), and has coupled it to the prometheus\nhydrodynamics code. The combined program allows\nfor spherically symmetric (Rampp & Janka 2000, 2002)\nas well as multi-dimensional simulations (Janka et al.\n2004; Buras et al. 2003). The spherically symmetric\n\"core\" of the program, which was used for the calculations described below, will be referred to by the name\nvertex (Variable Eddington factor Radiative Transfer\nfor supernova EXplosions).\n3.2.1. Hydrodynamics\n\nThe integration of the equations of hydrodynamics\nis performed with the Newtonian finite-volume code\n\nprometheus (Fryxell, M\u00fcller, & Arnett 1989) which\nwas supplemented by additional problem specific features (Keil 1997). prometheus is a direct Eulerian,\ntime-explicit implementation of the Piecewise Parabolic\nMethod (PPM) of Colella & Woodward (1984). As a\nGodunov scheme of third order in space and second-order\nin time with a Riemann solver, it is particularly well\nsuited for following discontinuities in the fluid flow like\nshocks or boundaries between layers of different chemical composition. A notable advantage is its capability of\ntackling multi-dimensional problems with high computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. The code makes\nuse of the \"Consistent Multifluid Advection (CMA)\"\nmethod (Plewa & M\u00fcller 1999) for ensuring accurate\nadvection of different chemical components in the fluid,\nand switches from the original PPM method to the more\ndiffusive HLLE solver of Einfeldt (1988) in the vicinity of\nstrong shocks to avoid spurious oscillations (the so-called\n\"odd-even decoupling\" phenomenon) when such shocks\nare aligned with one of the coordinate lines in multidimensional simulations (Quirk 1994; Kifonidis 2000;\nPlewa & M\u00fcller 2001).\n3.2.2. Neutrino transport\n\nThe variable Eddington factor scheme for the neutrino\ntransport, its coupling to the hydrodynamics part, and\napplication to a number of test problems is described in\nmuch detail elsewhere (Rampp & Janka 2002). Here we\nwill only briefly summarize the characteristic features of\nthe method. The coupled set of equations of hydrodynamics (Eqs. (1)\u2013(4) in Rampp & Janka (2002)) and\nradiation transport (Eqs. (6)\u2013(8) ibidem) is equivalent\nto Eqs. (2)-(7) in the order (v/c) limit. The equations are also split into a \"hydrodynamics part\" and a\n\"neutrino part\" and solved independently in subsequent\n(\"fractional\") steps. But the hydrodynamics and the\ntransport solver can use radial grids and/or time steps\nthat are different from each other.\nIn the neutrino transport method the integrodifferential character of the Boltzmann equation is tamed\nby applying a variable Eddington factor closure to the\nneutrino energy and momentum equations (and the simultaneously integrated first and second order moments\nequations for neutrino number). For this purpose the\nvariable Eddington factor is determined from the formal\nsolution of the Boltzmann equation on so-called \"tangent rays\". They coincide with radiation characteristics\nin Newtonian geometry. The system of the Boltzmann\nequation and its moments equations is iterated until convergence is achieved. The integration of the transport\nequations is implicit in time.\nGeneral relativistic effects are treated only approximately in the code (Rampp & Janka 2002). The current\nversion contains a modification of the gravitational potential by including correction terms due to pressure and\nenergy of the stellar medium and neutrinos, which are\ndeduced from a comparison of the Newtonian and relativistic equations of motion. The neutrino transport contains gravitational redshift and time dilation, but ignores\nthe distinction between coordinate radius and proper radius. This simplification is necessary for coupling the\ntransport code to the basically Newtonian hydrodynamics. We shall demonstrate in this paper that these approximations work satisfactorily well for the core collapse\n\n\f6\nand the early postbounce phase (see Sect. 4.3). Moderate quantitative but no qualitative differences from the\nfull relativistic treatment are mainly found at late times\nafter the accretion front has started to retreat.\n3.2.3. Parameter settings\n\nFor the neutrino transport in the N13 run an Eulerian radial grid with 235 radial zones (255 tangent rays)\nspaced logarithmically between 0 and 10 000 km was\nused. The neutrino spectrum between 0 and 380 MeV\nwas discretized with 21 geometrically zoned energy bins,\nthe center of the first bin being located at 2 MeV. The\nhydrodynamics, on the other hand, was solved on a radial\ngrid of 400 zones which are moved with the stellar fluid\nduring core collapse. Shortly after core bounce both radial grids were rezoned such that inside of a radius of 400\nkm the zones of the transport grid coincide with those of\nthe hydro grid. For the post-bounce evolution the coordinates of the hydrodynamics grid (as well as those of the\ntransport grid) remained fixed in time. Concerning the\nresolution and definition of numerical grids the same parameters were chosen in the G15 run with the exception\nthat 19 energy bins between 0 and 380 MeV were used\ninstead of 21 groups and a rezoning of the radial grid\nwas necessary at \u223c 200 ms after bounce. The new grid\n(hydrodynamics and neutrino transport) employs 40 additional radial zones in order to adequately represent the\nsteepening density gradients at the surface of the nascent\nneutron star.\n4. COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS\n\nThe simulations produce a sizeable amount of data,\neven if they are confined to one spatial dimension. Hence,\nwe start with an overview of what we are going to compare and how the comparable quantities are derived from\nthe code-specific results. During collapse and bounce it is\nquite natural to choose the enclosed baryon mass as spatial coordinate. It labels individual fluid elements and allows one to trace the history of each fluid element. Some\ntenths of milliseconds after bounce, the neutron star becomes rather static with mass accretion being essentially\nstationary. Therefore the presentation of the quantities\nas functions of radius is more appropriate. We present\nthe three independent quantities that determine the thermodynamic state of the fluid element as measured by an\nobserver comoving with the fluid: the rest mass density, the entropy per baryon, and the electron fraction.\nFurthermore, the radial velocity of the fluid element is\ndisplayed.\nNote that in case of the relativistic model, G15, the coordinate independent change in areal radius per proper\ntime, u = \u03b1\u22121 \u2202r/\u2202t, is plotted in the (b)-panels of\nFigs. 8, 9, 11, and 12 for the agile-boltztran run,\nwhereas the velocity, v = \u2202r/\u2202t, is unchanged from the\nNewtonian case in the general relativistic approximation\nof vertex. Typical deviations of the metric coefficients\nfrom unity are shown in Table 2. In summary, these deviations are of order 1% in the preshock region, increase\nfrom 1% to 6% at the neutrinosphere during the simulation, and reach maximum values around 20% at the\ncenter of the star in case of the lapse function and around\n10% close to the center in the case of \u0393.\nThe neutrino transport quantities are represented by\nthe neutrino luminosity and rms energy profiles as mea-\n\nTable 2\nMetric coefficients\ntpb [ms] \u03b1max \u03b1\u03bd \u03b1s \u0393max \u0393\u03bd \u0393s a\n-1\n4\n1 2\n1\n0\n15\n1 3\n8\n2\n5\n1\n15\n1 1\n7\n1\n2\n5\n15\n1 1\n7\n1\n1\n10\n15\n2 1\n7\n2\n1\n50\n17\n3 0\n7\n3\n1\n100\n18\n3 0\n8\n3\n0\n250\n23\n6 0\n10\n6\n1\na Listed are the lapse function, \u03b1, and the metric coefficient, \u0393,\nby their deviations from unity in percent at several post-bounce\ntimes tpb during the G15 simulation with agile-boltztran. The\nindices of \u03b1 and \u0393 refer to chosen locations where the values are\ngiven. The index s corresponds to the position outside of the shock\nor accretion front, the index \u03bd corresponds to the neutrinosphere\nof the heavy lepton neutrinos, and the index max stands for the\nmaximum value in the whole star.\n\nsured in the fluid rest frame. We also discuss selected\nquantities as functions of time, e.g. the trajectories of\nfluid elements, the position of the (accretion-)shock, the\nconditions at the center, or the neutrino luminosities and\nrms energies sampled at 500 km radius (as an approximation to radial infinity). The physical time in both runs\nis synchronized at bounce (t = 0), the moment when\nthe central density reaches a local maximum immediately before the shock is formed. Negative times in the\nsimulations therefore point to instances before bounce.\nWe define the shock position, Rs , by the maximum of\nthe velocity divergence (i.e. maximum compression, cf.\nEq. (2)),\n\u2202(4\u03c0r2 u)\n.\nr\n\u2202V\nThe luminosities and rms energies are given in the comoving frame as a function of the neutrino phase-space\ndistribution function F (t, a, \u03bc, E) according to\nZ\n2 2\u03c0c\nL(t, a) = 4\u03c0r \u03c1\nF (t, a, \u03bc, E)E 3 dE\u03bcd\u03bc\n(hc)3\nsR\nF (t, a, \u03bc, E)E 4 dEd\u03bc\nh\u01eb(t, a)irms = R\n.\nF (t, a, \u03bc, E)E 2 dEd\u03bc\nx(Rs ) = max [x(r)] ,\n\nx=\u2212\n\nIn the general relativistic case, the definition of\nF (t, a, \u03bc, E) in Eq. (8) implies that the luminosity at\nradius r must be interpreted as originating from a neutrino number per proper time crossing a mass shell as\nmeasured by an observer comoving with the shell. The\nneutrinos carry energies, E, which are also measured in\nthe comoving frame.\nWe compare time slices in our runs at three crucial\ninstances in the postbounce evolution: Bounce (tpb = 0\nms), burst (tpb = 3 ms), and broil (tpb > 100 ms). The\nimportance of core bounce, the instance when the infall is reversed at the center due to the strong repulsive\nforces above nuclear density, needs no further explanation. The time slice at 3 ms not only captures the launch\nof the electron neutrino burst, but also the interesting\nphase when the dynamical bounce-shock stalls (i.e., the\npostshock velocities become negative). At this time, long\nbefore any neutrino heating can take place, the infalling\n\n\f7\nmaterial does no longer change the direction of its velocity at the shock front. After deceleration at the accretion shock it continues to drift toward the center of the\nstar. Puffed-up by the dissipation of the kinetic energy\nacquired during infall, however, the net volume of accumulated shock-heated material still increases such that\nthe accretion front continues to expand to larger radii\nin a quasi-stationary manner. Only after the accretion\nfront has reached a position farther out in the gravitational well, where less kinetic energy is dissipated in the\nshock, do the temperature difference between the receding hot neutrinospheres and the cooler postshock matter\nbecome favorable for neutrino heating. These conditions\nare not met before a time of 50 ms after bounce. In spherically symmetric simulations the accretion front reaches\na maximum radius around 150 km at about 100 ms after bounce and recedes slowly thereafter. Therefore, we\nchoose a third snapshot in our comparison at this late\nphase where neutrino cooling and heating influence the\nquasi-stationary evolution.\n4.1. Hydrodynamics\n\nAs described above, the dynamical simulations are\nbased on the two very different hydrodynamics codes\nagile and prometheus. In order to disentangle hydrodynamics differences from neutrino transport differences\nin our results it is helpful to perform a comparison of\nan adiabatic collapse where all neutrino interactions are\nsuppressed. We found a simple test case that poses similar challenges to the hydrodynamics algorithms as the\ncase with full transport. We take the progenitor model\nof run N13 and replace the electron fraction and entropy\nas a function of enclosed mass by the values obtained\nat bounce in the N13 run with full transport. By this\nmeasure, the Chandrasekhar mass at core bounce, which\ndepends on electron fraction and temperature, is imposed\nalready at the beginning of the simulation. As expected,\nthe adiabatic collapse of this modified progenitor leads to\nbounce and shock formation at a similar mass coordinate\nas in the simulation with full transport, and therefore to\nsimilar conditions around bounce.\nFigure 1 shows the situation at 3 ms after bounce. This\nis the critical time when the dynamical shock in the full\nmodels stalls to turn into an accretion front. We find\nvery good agreement in the density and velocity profiles.\nThe latter show the same timing and amplitude of reflected sound waves in the ringing neutron star. Also the\nentropy profiles agree well. The entropy profile contains\ninformation about the evolution of the shock strength because the otherwise conserved entropy of a fluid element\ncan only change due to the dissipation of kinetic energy\nwhen matter passes through the shock front. The profile shows that both the shock in agile and the shock\nin prometheus start with a similar strength (almost\nidentical entropy peak at 0.55 M\u2299 ). In the further evolution, however, the shock in agile decays slightly faster,\nproducing lower postshock entropies. The weaker shock\npropagates more slowly with respect to the mass coordinate so that a small offset of the shock position becomes\nvisible at 3 ms after bounce.\n4.2. Newtonian 13 M\u2299 Model\n\nFor the runs that include neutrino transport, we start\nthe comparison with an investigation of differences in the\n\nFig. 1.- Snapshots at 3 ms after bounce for the adiabatic\ncollapse of the modified N13 progenitor. Data from the agile simulation are drawn with thick lines. Data from the prometheus\nsimulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (a) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles, panel (b) the\nentropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed lines). The hydrodynamics simulations agree well. The shock strength decays\nslightly faster in agile than in prometheus. The weaker shock in\nagile tends to propagate more slowly in mass and to produce a\nsmaller postshock entropy.\n\nN13 model, in which only \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e are taken into account. Figure 2 presents the conditions at bounce. The\nneutrino luminosities are shown in panel (a). We find\ntransient differences of order 30% in the electron neutrino luminosities at bounce in the diffusive regime inside\nof the nascent shock. The luminosities are in good agreement outside of the shock front and the electron neutrino\nrms energies in panel (c) agree well in all domains. The\nelectron antineutrino rms energies are very uncertain at\nthis time because the antineutrino abundance is negligi-\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 2.- Snapshots at bounce for model N13. Data from the agile-boltztran simulation are drawn with thick lines. Data from the\nvertex simulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles, panel (d) the\nentropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed lines). The neutrino luminosities are given in panel (a) and the neutrino rms energies\nin panel (c). Solid lines refer to electron neutrinos and dashed lines to electron antineutrinos. The central electron fraction in vertex is\nsmaller than in agile-boltztran and the shock forms at a slightly smaller enclosed mass. The high electron degeneracy during collapse\nsuppresses electron antineutrino production so that the corresponding luminosity at bounce is below the threshold of panel (a).\n\nble under the electron-degenerate conditions at bounce.\nImportant quantities at bounce are the entropy and the\nelectron fraction in panel (d) because they determine the\nsize of the causally connected homologous core. A shock\nforms when the outgoing pressure wave from the bounce\nat nuclear densities reaches its edge. The differences in\nthe electron fraction are of order 3%, the differences in\nthe neutrino abundances are even smaller.\n\nMost of these differences are introduced during the last\n2 ms before bounce. The profiles are in nearly perfect\nagreement before. This becomes evident in panels (c)\nand (d) of Fig. 3 where we plot the entropy and lepton fractions of the innermost zone as functions of density during core collapse. We find that the differences\nin deleptonization appear just before neutrino trapping\nsets in, i.e. when the effective electron capture rates are\n\n\f9\nhighest. The entropy evolution shows perfect agreement\nduring infall, but after neutrino trapping, an unphysical entropy increase in the innermost zones takes place\nin the agile-boltztran simulation. Fig. 2d clearly\ndemonstrates that this entropy increase only occurs in\nthe innermost zone. Probably more significant is the\nsmall deviation of order 5% in the lepton and electron\nfraction which appears at the same time. It is not confined to the innermost zone and influences the enclosed\nmass at shock formation.\nThe formation of the shock is visible in the velocity\nprofiles in panel (b) of Fig. 2. The difference in enclosed\nmass \u223c 3% between agile-boltztran and vertex is\nqualitatively consistent with the differences in the electron fraction profiles in Fig. 2d. The infall velocities\nin the outer core agree well. Panel (b) also shows the\ndensity profiles of the N13 run at bounce. We conclude\nthe discussion of bounce with the observation that there\nare small visible differences between the two N13 simulations, but none of them is likely to induce large deviations\nin the postbounce evolution.\nFigure 3 shows the mass trajectories for both runs during the first 10 ms after bounce, in panel (a) for agileboltztran and in panel (b) for vertex. The rising\ndashed line marks the shock position. A first inspection reveals a difference of 15% in shock radius at 7 ms\nafter bounce. As we will see later in Fig. 5, this difference is transient. It appears after a short dynamical phase of shock propagation, long before any neutrino\nheating takes place and long before the accretion front\nhas reached its maximum radius at \u223c 250 km in this\noptimistic model with reduced input physics.\nThe discrepancy originates from a different shock\nstrength as cause and a different neutrino burst behavior\nas consequence and amplification mechanism. The gradients of the mass trajectories in Figs. 3a and b indicate\nthe velocity of the material in the postshock region (at\nthe right hand side of the thick dashed line that represents the position of the shock). The bounce-shock is\ndynamical at the beginning and drives matter outward\nwith positive postshock velocities. At about 4 ms after\nbounce, the shock stalls because of the nuclear dissociation of infalling matter and neutrino losses. It converts\ninto an accretion shock, characterized by jump conditions that connect the high speed/low density infalling\nmaterial to the low speed/high density postshock material. There is an important difference between the dynamical and the accretion shock: The postshock material\nbehind a dynamical shock is diluted between the rarefaction wave and the shock front, while the material behind\nan accretion front continues to be compressed due to the\naccumulated mass. The examination of the mass trajectories in Fig. 3ab indicates that vertex maintains a dynamical shock for a longer time than agile-boltztran.\nThis is consistent with the result of the hydrodynamics\ncomparison in Fig. 1.\nThis difference in shock propagation is initially not\nvery large. It is significantly amplified by the coincidence\nof the electron neutrino burst with the transition from\na dynamical to an accretion shock. As the shock compresses the infalling lepton-rich material, the fermionic\nelectrons have to populate high energy levels and are\nrapidly converted to neutrinos by captures on protons as\nsoon as the density is low enough for the produced neu-\n\ntrinos to escape. This neutrino burst can be launched\nby the shock while it is still in its dynamical phase or\nafter it has stalled to an accretion front. If the neutrino\nburst is launched during the dynamical phase, infalling\nmatter deleptonizes due to the immediate compression\nin the shock front. After that, electron captures are\nreduced quickly because the matter re-expands behind\nthe dynamical shock and the density drops again. In\nan accretion shock, the infalling matter experiences the\nsame initial deleptonization in the shock front, but continues to emit neutrinos due to the compression behind\nthe shock. The neutrino burst from an accretion shock\nis therefore more intense. The neutrino emission behind\nthe shock removes energy and lepton number and reduces\nthe pressure support. It accelerates the attenuation of\nthe weaker shock and thereby amplifies the initial difference in shock strength. Using the lepton number source\nterm, ql , in units of generated leptons per baryon and\nsecond, we shaded in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 3 the\nregions where the neutrino emission 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1/mB \u00d7 ql exceeds the thresholds of 1051 cm\u22121 s\u22121 , 2 \u00d7 1051 cm\u22121 s\u22121 ,\nand 3 \u00d7 1051 cm\u22121 s\u22121 . The comparison of panels (a) and\n(b) illustrates that more neutrinos are lost from the region behind the weaker shock in the agile-boltztran\nsimulation. The initially stronger shock in the vertex\nsimulation suffers less neutrino losses and leads to a more\nrapidly expanding accretion front.\nAfter this investigation we can easily interpret the time\nslice at 3 ms after bounce presented in Fig. 4. In the\nluminosity, panel (a), we see good agreement during the\nlaunch of the neutrino burst. The somewhat higher rms\nenergies of the burst electron neutrinos, compared to the\npreviously emitted ones, are visible in panel (c). The\nentropy profile in panel (d) shows a slightly weaker shock\nin agile-boltztran than in vertex, very similar to the\ndifferences found for the hydrodynamics comparison in\nFig. 1. The electron fraction profiles now show that the\ndeleptonization of the postshock region between 0.8 and\n1.0 M\u2299 is more pronounced in agile-boltztran. This\nis consistent with the higher density visible in panel (b).\nThe positive velocities behind the shock also demonstrate\nthat the vertex shock has still a larger kinetic energy in\nthis snapshot. The shock in vertex will stall somewhat\nlater than in agile-boltztran.\nThe further evolution is best followed in the timedependent diagrams in Fig. 5. In panel (b), the luminosities and rms energies are shown, sampled at a fixed radius\nof 500 km. The two neutrino signals are qualitatively\nvery similar. The neutrino burst in agile-boltztran is\nsomewhat broader than in vertex and has a 7% smaller\npeak luminosity. The deviations after the burst are at\nmost 15% around 50 ms after bounce. This difference\nis a late consequence of the deleptonization differences\nduring the neutrino burst. The material in vertex is\nleft with higher electron fraction and higher entropy after the neutrino burst. Hence it deleptonizes at a higher\nrate afterwards. The rms energies tend to be lower in\nvertex than in agile-boltztran. Finally, panel (a)\ncompares the accretion front trajectories over a longer\nperiod of time. We find the described differences in the\nearly expansion of the accretion front. At 85 ms after\nbounce, however, the trajectories cross and a larger maximum radius is reached in the agile-boltztran simulation. The maximum radius of the accretion front differs\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 3.- Panel (a) shows the first 10 ms after bounce for model N13 in the simulation with agile-boltztran. Panel (b) shows the\nsame time period in the simulation with vertex. The thin lines represent trajectories of fluid elements spaced with an interval of 0.02\nM\u2299 . The dashed line marks the shock position as a function of time. The gradients of the mass trajectories at the right hand side of the\ndashed line indicate the postshock velocities. At \u223c 4 ms after bounce the shock has stalled. It turns into an expanding accretion front\nwith negative postshock velocities. Areas with strong neutrino emission are shaded in three levels corresponding to values of one, two,\nand three times 1051 neutrinos per centimeter and second (i.e. for 4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1/mB \u00d7 ql , where ql is the lepton number source term in units of\nleptons per baryon and second). The coincidence of the launch of the neutrino burst with the transition from a dynamical to an accretion\nshock in this model leads to an amplification of the small hydrodynamics differences found above. The region behind the weaker shock\nin agile-boltztran experiences more compression. It therefore deleptonizes more rapidly and the weak shock loses even more pressure\nsupport than the stronger shock in the vertex simulation. The accretion front therefore expands more slowly in the agile-boltztran\nsimulation. Panel (c) compares the entropy of the innermost zone as a function of density in agile-boltztran (thick line) and in vertex\n(thin line). The agreement before trapping is close to perfect, dynamically insignificant differences appear at larger densities. Panel (d)\nshows an analogous comparison for the electron fraction (solid lines) and lepton fraction (dashed lines) in the innermost zone.\n\n\f11\n\nFig. 4.- Snapshots at 3 ms after bounce for model N13. Data from the agile-boltztran simulation are drawn with thick lines. Data\nfrom the vertex simulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles, panel\n(d) the entropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed lines). Panels (a) and (c) show the neutrino luminosities and rms energies\nrespectively. Solid lines refer to electron neutrinos and dashed lines to electron antineutrinos. The snapshot reveals similar small differences\nas the hydrodynamics comparison in Fig. 1.\n\n\f12\n\nFig. 5.- The shock position as a function of time for model N13 is shown in panel (a). The shock in vertex (thin line) propagates\ninitially faster and nicely converges after its maximum expansion to the position of the shock in agile-boltztran (thick line). The neutrino\nluminosities and rms energies for model N13 are presented as functions of time in panel (b). The values are sampled at a radius of 500\nkm in the comoving frame. The solid lines belong to electron neutrinos and the dashed lines to electron antineutrinos. The line width\ndistinguishes between the results from agile-boltztran and vertex in the same way as in panel (a). The luminosity peaks are nearly\nidentical, the rms energies have the tendency to be larger in agile-boltztran.\n\nby \u223c 8% between the two simulations. This difference\nis due to the higher preshock entropies in the agileboltztran simulation visible in Fig. 6d. The difference in the entropies of the infalling material stems from\nthe interface between the silicon layer and the material\nin nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). The burning in\nagile-boltztran cannot be switched off completely for\nthis comparison, because conversions between non-NSE\nand NSE are unavoidable when the adaptive grid moves\nits zones relative to the mass coordinate. This produces\na local entropy peak at the composition interface (see\nFig. 4d at an enclosed mass of 1.2 M\u2299 ) which crosses\nthe accretion front at 85 ms after bounce. The higher entropy leads to a temporarily lowered accretion rate which\nallows the accretion front in the agile-boltztran simulation to propagate to a larger radius than in the vertex simulation where no conversions between non-NSE\nand NSE occur during this simulation with reduced input\nphysics. After the initial expansion phase, where matter\npiles up on the neutron star hydrostatically, the pressure\nsupport in the cooling region starts to diminish rapidly\nand the matter in the heating region is pulled inward\nfrom below (see e.g. Janka (2001); Liebend\u00f6rfer et al.\n(2001)). Simultaneously, the mass shell in the preshock\nregion containing the described entropy differences has\nfallen through the shock and the entropy becomes more\nsimilar again. Therefore the trajectories of the accretion\nfront converge and agree well during the shock recession\nphase.\nWe finish the comparison of the N13 model with a\ncloser look at a time slice at 150 ms after bounce (Fig.\n\n6), which is a snapshot during this quasi-stationary accretion phase. Panel (a) demonstrates excellent agreement of the luminosities in all regions of the computational domain. The rms energies in panel (c) show small\ndifferences, especially outside of 100 km radius. The velocity profiles in panel (b) agree well if one disregards the\ndifferent shock positions explained above. The higher accretion rates in vertex of material with lower entropy\nlead to a higher density in the cooling region. This is visible in the density profiles in panel (b) and the entropy\nprofiles in panel (d). The reaction time scale is comparable to the dynamical time scale inside the gain radius\nat 115 \u2212 120 km. The infalling fluid element therefore\nis close to weak equilibrium in the given neutrino background. Since the neutrino luminosities are very similar\nin the two simulations, the larger density of the vertex\nrun requires a lower equilibrium electron fraction in the\ncooling region inside the gain radius. The corresponding\ndifferences in the pressure profiles imply less support for\nthe shock and are consistent with a smaller radius of the\naccretion front.\n4.3. General Relativistic 15 M\u2299 Model\n\nFor the analysis of the G15 simulations we start again\nwith the description of the conditions at bounce. The\nevolution of the entropy and lepton fraction in the innermost zone is shown in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 7.\nCompared to model N13 with Newtonian gravity, the\ncentral entropy in the general relativistic G15 model is\n15% higher and the lepton and electron fractions are 5%\nlower. The deviations between the vertex and agile-\n\n\f13\n\nFig. 6.- Snapshots at 150 ms after bounce for model N13. Data from the agile-boltztran simulation are drawn with thick lines. Data\nfrom the vertex simulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles, panel\n(d) the entropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed lines). The neutrino luminosities and rms energies are shown in panels (a) and\n(c) respectively. Solid lines refer to electron neutrinos and dashed lines to electron antineutrinos. This stationary-state situation is typical\nof the neutrino heating phase at later time after bounce. The agreement is satisfactorily close in most quantities.\n\nboltztran simulations are of order 3% with the exception of an entropy increase in the innermost zone in the\nagile-boltztran simulation. As shown in Fig. 8d,\nexcellent agreement is found in all other regions of the\nmodel up to the burning front, where different approximations in tracking the composition and nuclear burning\nexplain the larger differences. In contrast to the entropy\ndifference in the innermost zone, the small differences\nin the electron fraction apply to the whole high-density\n\nregion enclosed by the shock.\nThe luminosity profiles at bounce are displayed in Fig.\n8a. Outside of the shock front, they have been set during collapse and agree well. Also the luminosities in the\ndiffusive regime reveal no mentionable differences. As a\nconsequence of the differences of the electron fraction visible in panel (d), the velocity and density profiles in panel\n(b) show the formation of the shock front in vertex at a\nslightly deeper point than in agile-boltztran. In con-\n\n\f14\n\nFig. 7.- Panel (a) shows the first 10 ms after bounce for model G15 in the simulation with agile-boltztran. Panel (b) shows the\nsame time period in the simulation with vertex. The thin lines represent trajectories of fluid elements spaced with an interval of 0.02\nM\u2299 . Areas with strong neutrino emission are shaded in three levels corresponding to values of one, two, and three times 1051 neutrinos\nper centimeter and second (i.e. for 4\u03c0r 2 \u03c1/mB \u00d7 ql , where ql is the lepton number source term in units of leptons per baryon and second).\nBoth codes obtain an extended region of strong neutrino emission behind the shock, which turns into an accretion front (dashed line) at\n3 \u2212 4 ms after bounce. Panel (c) compares the entropy of the innermost zone as a function of density in agile-boltztran (thick line) and\nin vertex (thin line). The agreement before trapping is close to perfect, dynamically insignificant differences appear at larger densities.\nPanel (d) shows a comparison of the electron fraction (solid lines) and lepton fraction (dashed lines) in the innermost zone. The deviations\nbetween the two codes are of order 3%.\n\nsideration of this displacement in the shock position, also\nthe rms neutrino energies in panel (c) are in satisfactory\nagreement.\nThe early postbounce evolution of the G15 model\nis less sensitive to small differences than the previously discussed N13 simulation.\nThe main reason is the weaker bounce shock. General relativis-\n\ntic effects during core collapse shift the sonic point\nto a 20% smaller enclosed mass and lead to a\nless energetic bounce shock (Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2001;\nBruenn, DeNisco, & Mezzacappa 2001) which has to\ndissociate more infalling material. The inclusion of \u03bcand \u03c4 -neutrinos in the G15 runs causes additional energy drain from the region behind the shock. After the\n\n\f15\n\nFig. 8.- Snapshots at bounce for model G15. Data from the agile-boltztran simulation are drawn with thick lines. Data from\nthe vertex simulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles, panel (d)\nthe entropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed lines). The neutrino luminosities and rms energies are given in panels (a) and (c),\nrespectively. Solid lines correspond to electron neutrinos, dashed lines to electron antineutrinos, and dash-dotted lines to \u03bc- or \u03c4 -neutrinos\n(or their antiparticles). In the region enclosed by the shock the luminosities in agile-boltztran are smaller than in vertex, consistent\nwith the larger central electron fraction and a slightly larger enclosed mass at shock formation.\n\nshock has stalled within 1 ms in both G15 simulations,\nthe electron neutrino burst is launched during the accretion shock phase. As expected from the discussion of\nthe neutrino emission from the shock in the N13 model,\npanels (a) and (b) in Fig. 7 reveal a well extended region of high neutrino emission behind the shock. Since\nthe postshock matter develops negative velocities a few\nmilliseconds after bounce, the further evolution is deter-\n\nmined by the continued accumulation of accreted matter, more and more effectively cooled as the accretion\nfront reaches layers with lower matter densities and neutrino opacities. This quasi-stationary evolution is less\nsensitive to differences in the numerics or input physics\nthan the dynamical shock propagation in the more optimistic N13 simulation. The feedback between neutrino\ntransport and hydrodynamics amplifies differences in the\n\n\f16\npropagation of dynamical shocks, because the material\nbehind the weaker shock emits more neutrinos so that\nthe shock loses even more pressure support. In case of\na quasi-stationary accretion front, differences are likely\nto be reduced because a larger accretion rate produces\nlarger neutrino losses.\nHowever, differences can still be observed: The agileboltztran shock is stronger at formation. As in the\nN13 simulations, this is partly due to the higher electron\nfraction in the homologous core of the agile-boltztran\nsimulation. A difference in the entropy profiles is left\nbehind when the shock passes an enclosed mass of 0.75\nM\u2299 in Fig. 9d. This points to a larger deviation between\nthe initial shock strengths than in the N13 simulations\nso that the agile-boltztran shock expands initially\nfaster in Fig. 7a. The differences between the electron\nfraction profiles in Fig. 9d, however, suggest that later\non a faster deleptonization in agile-boltztran damps\nthe expansion of the accretion front and as a consequence\nthe shock positions in both simulations converge again.\nThis connection between a somewhat enhanced neutrino\nloss and a deceleration of the expansion of the accretion\nfront is supported by the shaded areas in panels (a) and\n(b) of Fig. 7, which highlight differences in the regions\nof strong neutrino emission in both simulations.\nIn Fig. 9b, a lower density at 0.75 M\u2299 is caused by\nthe higher entropy in the agile-boltztran run. The\nvelocity profiles at 3 ms after bounce are in very good\nagreement. A slightly higher infall velocity in front of\nthe shock leads to a positive entropy gradient between\n0.8 M\u2299 and \u223c 1 M\u2299 in vertex. Also the neutrino luminosities at 3 ms after bounce in Fig. 9a do not reveal new\nfeatures, except for the presence of \u03bc- and \u03c4 -neutrinos\nthat had not been included in the N13 run. Because of\nthe absence of charged-current reactions of these neutrinos, they decouple at higher densities and reach appreciable luminosities earlier in the evolution, before the\nappearance of electron antineutrinos, which are initially\nsuppressed by the high electron degeneracy. The apparent difference in the electron antineutrino luminosity between agile-boltztran and vertex is due to a small\ntime lag in displaying this rapidly rising quantity.\nThe further evolution is resumed in Fig. 10. Panel\n(a) compares the position of the accretion front as a\nfunction of time for the G15 models. During the expansion of the accretion front, we find very good agreement\nand the maximum radius is nearly identical. Afterwards,\nthe accretion front retreats somewhat more slowly in the\nagile-boltztran simulation than in the vertex simulation. In the latter, the retraction transiently stagnates\nbetween 150 and 180 ms after bounce. Such features are\ncaused by the steep density drop at the infalling interfaces between layers of different composition outside of\nthe iron core. The transition to the oxygen-rich silicon\nlayer passes the shock at about 165 ms after bounce.\nagile-boltztran tracks the structure of the outer layers less accurately because of the artificial diffusion introduced by the adaptive grid. Discrete transitions between\nlayers are therefore washed out to some extent such that\ntheir impact on the trajectory of the accretion front is\nless pronounced, although still qualitatively visible. The\nluminosity peaks during the electron neutrino burst deviate only by 3% in the G15 simulations, the average\npeak value is 3.8 \u00d7 1053 erg/s with a half-width of 6 ms.\n\nThe further time evolution of the luminosities and rms\nenergies in panel (b) reveals \u223c 20% larger values in the\nvertex run. These are at least in part a consequence\nof the increased accretion rate in the vertex simulation\nduring the retraction phase of the accretion front. We\nwill make this argument more precise in the following\ndiscussion of late time slices.\nWe present two time slices for the long-term evolution\nof the G15 simulation. The first time slice is at 100 ms\nafter bounce when the neutrino heating is most efficient.\nThe second time slice at 250 ms marks the end of the\ntime period covered by the simulations. The time slice\nat 100 ms is given in Fig. 11. Panel (b) shows the shock\nin vertex at a slightly smaller radius and the preshock\ninfall velocities to be somewhat higher than in agileboltztran. The luminosities in panel (a) are up to 20%\nlarger in vertex. The luminosity discontinuity across\nthe shock front caused by the Doppler frequency shift\nand angular aberration for an observer in the comoving\nframe is also larger in vertex because of the larger luminosity and the larger velocity jump visible in panel (b).\nOtherwise the relative differences between the two runs\nare just inverse to the situation we analyzed in Fig. 6 in\ncase of the N13 simulation. Now agile-boltztran has\na higher density in the shocked material in panel (b) and\na correspondingly lower entropy and electron fraction in\npanel (d). Also the neutrino rms energies in panel (c)\nare now lower than in the vertex simulation.\nWe also include the latest time slice at 250 ms after\nbounce in Fig. 12. The panels show the same qualitative features we have discussed in the context of Fig. 11,\nbut at this late time to a much larger extent. The protoneutron star in the vertex simulation is more compact, causing the accretion front to reside at a smaller\nradius and the luminosities of all neutrino flavors to be\nlarger and to have harder spectra than in the agileboltztran simulation. Due to the smaller radius of the\naccretion front and higher infall velocities ahead of it, the\npostshock entropy is significantly higher in the vertex\nrun.\nA more compact neutron star with a larger mass and\na stronger gravitational potential (which would lead to\nhigher preshock velocities) can be a consequence of a\nhigher mass accretion rate. Indeed we observe differences\nin the mass flux to the shock, which can be caused by the\ndifferent quality to follow structures in the outer stellar\nlayers in both simulations. An infalling density feature\nin vertex (which might evolve differently due to the different treatment of \"burning\" and thus different entropy\nand pressure, or may be smoothed by the diffusivity of\nthe adaptive grid in agile-boltztran) transiently enhances or reduces the accretion rate. When, for example, the transition to the oxygen-rich silicon layer falls in\nshortly before 200 ms after bounce, the accretion rate decreases sharply and the retraction of the accretion front\nin the vertex simulation stagnates. This is consistent\nwith the luminosity reduction during this phase. But\nthe artificial diffusion in the outer layers of the agileboltztran simulation can explain only transient differences of the mass accretion rate and of the total accreted\nmass, because an associated redistribution of matter and\na modification of the preshock structure is limited to a\ncertain radial domain. It should, however, not produce\npersistent differences in the density distribution behind\n\n\f17\n\nFig. 9.- Snapshots at 3 ms after bounce for model G15. Data from the agile-boltztran simulation are drawn with thick lines. Data\nfrom the vertex simulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles, panel\n(d) the entropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed lines). The neutrino luminosities and rms energies are given in panels (a) and (c),\nrespectively. Solid lines correspond to electron neutrinos, dashed lines to electron antineutrinos, and dash-dotted lines to \u03bc- or \u03c4 -neutrinos\n(or their antiparticles). Variations in the entropy profiles reflect the differences in the shock strength at bounce. The deleptonization by\nthe neutrino burst occurs an instant earlier in the agile-boltztran simulation.\n\nthe shock, which in fact can be seen in Figs. 11 and 12\n(cf. the density profiles in panels (b)). A closer inspection of our models in fact reveals that the mass accretion\nrate outside of the shock and the baryonic mass accumulated in the neutron star show temporary differences only\nbetween \u223c30 ms and \u223c200 ms, but become very similar\nagain toward the end of our simulations.\nThe systematically evolving and growing difference during the long-term evolution must therefore\n\nbe caused by another effect.\nThe combination of\nhigher luminosities, higher rms energies and higher entropies at the neutrinosphere reminds us of the differences found between Newtonian and general relativistic simulations, where they are due to differences between the Newtonian and relativistic gravitational potential (Bruenn, DeNisco, & Mezzacappa 2001;\nLiebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2001). Both of our numerical methods are designed to accurately describe the hydrostatic\n\n\f18\n\nFig. 10.- Panel (a) shows the position of the accretion front as a function of time for model G15. The two simulations predict a\nvery similar early expansion of the accretion front up to a maximum radius of 150 km. Then, the accretion front in vertex (thin line)\nretreats faster than in agile-boltztran (thick line) in response to the slightly stronger contraction of the nascent neutron star due to the\napproximate treatment of general relativity in the vertex simulation. The hump in the vertex shock position at \u223c 180 ms after bounce\ncorresponds to an entropy and density discontinuity at the bottom of the oxygen-rich silicon shell. Because the vertex simulation resolves\nthe structure of the outer layers of the progenitor star more accurately than the diffusive adaptive grid in agile-boltztran, this feature is\nless pronounced in the latter simulation. The neutrino luminosities and rms energies are presented as functions of time in panel (b). The\nvalues are sampled at a radius of 500 km in the comoving frame. The solid lines correspond to electron neutrinos, the dashed lines to electron\nantineutrinos, and the dash-dotted lines to \u03bc- or \u03c4 -neutrinos (or their antiparticles). The line width distinguishes between the results from\nagile-boltztran (thick lines) and vertex (thin lines). The differences in the neutrino results are mainly-but not exclusively-indirect\nconsequences (due to the more compact neutron star) of the approximate treatment of general relativity in the vertex simulation.\n\nstructure of the protoneutron star according to the solution of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. But in the relativistic case differences in the potential can not only be caused by a difference of the enclosed mass at a given radius. In contrast to the Newtonian case, the relativistic potential depends highly nonlinearly on the structure of the configuration through its\ndependence on the mass distribution, pressure, and energy density. The gravitational potential is therefore sensitive to differences in the early post-bounce dynamics of\nthe propagating shock (e.g., due to the different initial\nshock strength) and to pressure and entropy differences\ncreated at later times, e.g., associated with the transient\ndifferences of the mass accretion rate or due to the higher\ninfall velocities ahead of the shock in the vertex run.\nThe overestimation of the velocities in the collapse layer\nis also a consequence of the approximation of general relativity in case of vertex. The latter code uses only a\ngravitational potential that is corrected for general relativistic effects, but ignores relativistic kinematics. When\nthe preshock values of the infall velocities reach 10\u201315%\nof the speed of light, the velocities computed by vertex\nare overestimated in comparison to the relativistic velocities calculated by agile-boltztran. This again has\nan influence on the long-term post-bounce evolution and\nthus feeds back into the core structure and causes a nonlinear response of the relativistic potential. While we find\n\nthat the maximum densities at bounce and the following\nrelaxation to a static situation are in good agreement between the vertex and agile-boltztran runs, we subsequently observe clear deviations of the central density\nand of the density profile which gradually evolve and\ngrow at later times. The vertex simulation develops a\nhigher central density and a steeper density gradient outside of the high-density core, and thus a more compact\nneutron star with a higher relativistic potential. This\nis confirmed by Fig. 13 which shows the profiles of the\n1/2\n\u22121/2\nmetric coefficients \u03b1 = gtt and \u0393 = gaa \u2202r/\u2202a in Eq.\n(1) at 250 ms after bounce. The smaller deviations from\nunity of the metric coefficients in the agile-boltztran\nrun are consistent with the less compact structure of the\nprotoneutron star in this simulation. The profiles also\nshow that the metric coefficients are nearly unity outside\nof the accretion front. The larger preshock velocities for\nthe vertex run in Figs. 11b and 12b are therefore not a\nconsequence of the fact that the lapse function is not included in the velocity plotted for this simulation. They\nare more likely caused by the disregard of kinematical\neffects and a stronger gravitational potential in the approximation of general relativity used in vertex.\n4.4.

Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles,\npanel (d) the entropy (solid lines) and electron fraction (dashed line).

Solid lines correspond to electron neutrinos, dashed lines to electron antineutrinos, and dash-dotted lines to \u03bcor \u03c4 -neutrinos (or their antiparticles). In this time slice we find a smaller shock position, somewhat faster infall ahead of the shock, and\nhigher postshock infall velocities in vertex compared to the results of agile-boltztran. Consistent with the more compact structure of\nthe protoneutron star, the entropies, neutrino luminosities, and neutrino rms energies in vertex are larger than in agile-boltztran.\n\ntions of idealized problems which have analytical solutions (Messer\n2000; Rampp & Janka\n2002; Liebend\u00f6rfer, Rosswog, & Thielemann\n2002;\nLiebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2004). Here we directly compare\nthe results of the codes in the application they were actually developed for. Our aim was to assess quantitative\ndifferences in complex supernova simulations to reduce\nthe probability of qualitative differences in future appli-\n\ncations. We also intended to create points of reference\nfor future testing of codes that handle the challenges\nof supernova physics, and to lay the foundations for\nperforming such tests in a more realistic way than by\nmeans of comparison with analytic solutions of idealized\ntest problems.\nWe have encountered two fundamental difficulties in\nour comparison. The first is the fact that the two codes\n\n\f20\n\nFig. 12.- Snapshots at 250 ms after bounce for model G15. Data from the agile-boltztran simulation are drawn with thick lines.\nData from the vertex simulation are drawn with thin lines. Panel (b) shows the velocity (solid lines) and density (dashed lines) profiles,\npanel (d) the entropy and electron abundances. The neutrino luminosities and rms energies are displayed in panels (a) and (c). Solid lines\ncorrespond to electron neutrinos, dashed lines to electron antineutrinos, and dash-dotted lines to \u03bc- or \u03c4 -neutrinos (or their antiparticles).\nThe protoneutron star in the vertex simulation is more compact than in the agile-boltztran simulation.\n\nemploy different methods, use different basic quantities,\nand are differently structured. The comparison of the\nresults of the two approaches is straightforward, but it\nis by far more challenging (and sometimes impossible)\nto track differences back to their origin if the compared\nquantities are not calculated in a similar way. The second difficulty is more related to supernova physics than\nto the methodology. In the comparison of our results we\nhave very often encountered the situation that all quanti-\n\nties within either one simulation are perfectly consistent,\nbut still not the same as in the other simulation. Further\ninvestigations of the differences revealed small initial differences in several tightly coupled quantities that grow\nwith ongoing evolution. Because of the strong feedbacks\nin the supernova problem it was often almost impossible\nto separate cause and consequences of the deviations.\nThis strong coupling between quantities indicates that\nthe problem is governed by many equilibria. Sometimes\n\n\f21\n\n1/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\nFig. 13.- Metric coefficients \u03b1 = gtt and \u0393 = gaa \u2202r/\u2202a =\n\u00031/2\n1 + (u/c)2 \u2212 2Gm/(rc2 )\nin the G15 run at 250 ms after\nbounce. The discontinuity of the lapse function across the shock\nfront reflects the fact that the comoving frame is not an inertial system in the special relativistic limit. Results from agile-boltztran\nare plotted with tick lines, those from vertex with thin lines. The\nhigher compactness of the neutron star in the vertex run is obvious. Ahead of the shock metric effects are very small.\n\u0002\n\nthe results converge again and find back to a similar evolution as soon as the equilibrium is achieved. This is for\nexample the case in model N13 when stationary-state\naccretion is established after the very dynamical early\npostbounce phase.\nWhen we consider just the overall dynamical evolution\nof the spherically symmetric postbounce phases in Figs.\n5 and 10, we find agreement in all qualitative features\nof the history. But we also find some significant quantitative differences. For example, the early shock propagation and the luminosities during the first 100 ms after\nbounce are different in model N13. We attribute an important part of these differences to the hydrodynamical\nshock propagation that appears to maintain a stronger\nshock in vertex than in agile-boltztran. The close\ncoincidence of the neutrino burst with the transition from\na dynamical to an accretion shock in this model leads to\nan amplification of existing differences. The region behind the weaker shock in agile-boltztran deleptonizes\nto a larger extent than behind the slightly stronger shock\nin vertex. While the deleptonization burst is more\nextended in agile-boltztran, the vertex core could\nmaintain higher luminosities later on. This may be the\nreason for a somewhat more optimistic shock propagation in the early phase of the vertex simulation of model\nN13.\nNo such amplification effect takes place in the G15\nmodel where the shocks in both runs have already made\nthe transition to an accretion front when they reach densities from where neutrinos begin to escape. Despite\nof some differences in the time-dependence of the shock\n\nstrength, the evolution of these two more realistic runs\nwith \"standard\" input physics agrees nicely during the\nearly post-bounce phase. We find good agreement of\nthe neutrino quantities in the diffusive inner core of the\nprotoneutron star and the timing and peak height of\nthe neutrino burst. The approximations of general relativistic effects in vertex yield accurate results until\nbounce and do not introduce larger uncertainties with\nrespect to the general relativistic approach than other\nacceptable approximations. Differences appear only in\nthe later evolution when the outer layers of the progenitor fall into the stalled accretion front. Some of these\ndifferences are caused by a different description of nuclear burning in both codes and a different capability to\ntrack the composition interfaces in the outer layers of\nthe collapsing core. The main reason for the differences,\nhowever, is the approximate treatment of general relativity in the vertex simulation. The basically Newtonian hydrodynamics code employs a relativistically modified gravitational potential which in principle allows one\nto accurately describe hydrostatic configurations according to the TOV equation (Rampp & Janka 2002). But\nthe code disregards the effects of relativistic kinematics which causes an overestimation of the infall velocity\nahead of the shock. The corresponding differences in\nthe dynamical evolution feed back into the gravitational\npotential in a nonlinear way. This leads to a slightly\nmore compact neutron star, a somewhat smaller radius of\nthe accretion front, and a faster infall of matter between\nshock and neutron star, producing up to \u223c 20% higher\naccretion luminosities and rms energies of neutrinos and\nantineutrinos of all flavors. While most of these discrepancies in the neutrino quantities are a consequence of the\ndifferent structure of the accretion layer in the vertex\nand agile-boltztran simulations, a smaller contribution may also be ascribed to the fact that vertex takes\ninto account general relativistic redshift, but ignores the\nmetric effects in the radial coordinate.\nThe overall evolution, however, is consistent between\nboth runs also in case of the relativistic G15 model. Even\nmore, both computations produce not only a remarkable\nqualitative similarity of the behavior during all phases\nbut also show nice agreement in most features of the\nradial profiles of the important quantities. This result\nmay be especially useful for multi-dimensional simulations, where essential general relativistic effects should\nnot be ignored, but a full relativistic treatment might\nnot have highest priority.\nBoth methods have their vulnerabilities and some of\nthem have led to lively discussions in the past. agileboltztran was criticized because of the rigorous approach and the generous consumption of computer memory and CPU time. The resolution of the neutrino phase\nspace was considered to be at the lower justifiable limit\nin earlier simulations. And indeed, the certainty that\nthe evolution follows basic physical principles independently of the resolution must be earned by very specific\ntwists and wrinkles in the finite difference representation\n(Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2004). vertex has raised concerns\nwith regard to consistency as it uses disjunct gridding for\nradiation transport and hydrodynamics and applies regridding procedures after bounce. The separate solution\nof the transport equations for neutrino number and neutrino energy only adds to the complexity. However, we\n\n\f22\ndid not find discrepancies in our comparison that would\nsupport any of these concerns to a degree that would\nquestion the reliability of the qualitative results of our\nexplosion-free supernova simulations.\nThe different strengths of the codes are more visible in\nthe quantitative details of the calculations. vertex produces great angular resolution in the flux factors even\nfar from the neutrinospheres and keeps properly track\nof the sharp discontinuities in the composition of the\nouter layers. Its extendibility to two-dimensional simulations is built-in (Rampp & Janka 2002) and the general relativistic approximation can be expected to produce good results in multi-dimensional situations as well\n(Buras et al. 2003). However, the solution of a model\nBoltzmann equation is much more involved in more than\none dimension. Additional approximations introduced\nby spherical averaging or ray-by-ray techniques cannot\nbe tested in a comparison between spherically symmetric\nmodels. If these approximations are good, the variable\nEddington factor approach is a very efficient technique\nfor multidimensional simulations.\nagile-boltztran demonstrates that the solution of\nonly one transport equation for the neutrino distribution\nfunction can provide accurate radiation transport solutions in the diffusion limit and semi-transparent regime.\nNumber and energy conservation are reasonably well fulfilled and the description of hydrodynamics and radiation\ntransport add up to one consistent general relativistic finite difference representation of radiation hydrodynamics\nin spherical symmetry (Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2004). The\napproach is in principle extendible to two and three dimensions and allows for adaptive zoning because it is\nbased on the local description of the transport equation\nin confined fluid elements. But consistency is easily lost\nin higher dimensions (Cardall & Mezzacappa 2003) and\ncomputer performance may become prohibitive in an implicit multidimensional discrete ordinates approach.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have compared two different approaches to implement Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics simulations of stellar\ncore collapse and postbounce evolution. We performed\ncalculations for two different progenitor stars, the 13\nM\u2299 progenitor of Nomoto & Hashimoto (1988) and the\n15 M\u2299 progenitor of Woosley & Weaver (1995). We\npresent one Newtonian calculation (N13) with the minimum input physics that leads to a plausible scenario after\nbounce and a second relativistic calculation (G15) with\nthe \"standard\" physics used in many recent supernova\nsimulations. We find similar agreement in both cases.\nThe reduced complexity of the input physics in the N13\nmodel helps to isolate differences in the implementation\nof the hydrodynamics and the neutrino transport. We\ncould improve the agreement by upgrading the first order\ndonor-cell advection scheme in the implicit hydrodynamics code agile to a second order TVD advection scheme.\nThe version with first order advection led to a more pessimistic shock propagation during the first 10 ms after\nbounce. It did, however, reveal an interesting relationship between the transition of the propagating discontinuity from a dynamical shock to an accretion front and\nthe almost coincident launch of the neutrino burst.\nA neutrino burst radiated from an accretion front\n\nmaintains a high luminosity for a longer time than a\nneutrino burst produced by a dynamical shock, because\nan accretion front compresses matter at steady-state like\nconditions whereas the layer behind a dynamical shock\ngets diluted quickly so that electron captures diminish on\na short timescale. Therefore less lepton number is lost in\nneutrinos from a dynamical shock which rapidly crosses\nthe neutrinospheres, but neutrinos extract more leptons\nfrom the compressed matter behind the accretion front\nonce the shock has stalled (i.e., the postshock velocity has\nbecome negative). This effect, however, turned out to\nproduce transient differences only for a few milliseconds\nin our simulations, and convergence of the shock trajectories was found again after the shocks in both runs had\ntransformed to accretion fronts. While the optimistic\nN13 model with only one neutrino flavor (\u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e ) represents a case where the neutrinospheres are crossed by\na dynamical shock, the relativistic model G15 serves as\nan example where the shock forms at a smaller enclosed\nmass due to the deeper general relativistic potential and\nwhere additional losses occur by the emission of \u03bc- and\n\u03c4 -neutrinos from deeper layers. In this case the shock\nturns into an accretion front before or at the time the\nneutrino burst is launched.\nThe overall evolution of both models is in good agreement when simulations with the two codes are compared.\nDifferences in details were found, e.g., a slightly different shock propagation in the early hydrodynamical phase\nand more smearing of the composition interfaces in the\nouter progenitor layers by artificial diffusion in the case\nof agile. The luminosities in vertex tend to be slightly\nhigher than in agile-boltztran and the rms energies\na little lower in the N13 model. The approximation of\ngeneral relativistic effects by a modified gravitational potential in otherwise Newtonian hydrodynamics in vertex is very accurate up to bounce. In comparison with\nthe general relativistic simulation of agile-boltztran,\nhowever, a somewhat deeper potential associated with\nhigher accretion rates develops during the long-term\npostbounce evolution. The consequence are larger neutrino luminosities and rms energies. But in general, good\nqualitative and satisfactory quantitative agreement of all\nimportant temporal and radial features was found also\nin the relativistic model. Major differences can result\nfrom implementation-specific rather than from methodspecific details, e.g. from the former use of a low-order\nadvection scheme in agile-boltztran or from the specific choice of the finite differencing in both codes.\nWe come to the conclusion that both methods work\nsatisfactorily well in this application and give comparable results. We determined similar computational\nneeds for our not thoroughly optimized codes. Standard\nruns with agile-boltztran tend to consume slightly\nless computer time. But standard runs with vertex\nhave been performed with better energy resolution and\nthe angular resolution that can be achieved at larger\nradii is out of reach for SN methods. Hence, a detailed comparison of CPU time requirements is not really meaningful. Moreover, faster methods may have\nbeen developed in the meantime (Burrows et al. 2000;\nThompson, Burrows, & Pinto 2003). Rather than arguing about the \"best\" method for a certain application,\nwe recommend to pursue a variety of feasible numerical\napproaches for future astrophysical simulations, opening\n\n\f23\nup the possibility of independent mutual validation of the\nresults. We hope that our comparison provides a useful\nstep towards quantitative modeling of a very complex\nastrophysical problem.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank R. Buras and O. E. B.
