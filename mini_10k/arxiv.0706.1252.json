B. Sokoloff\nDepartment of Physics and\nCenter for Interdisciplinary Research on Complex Systems\nNortheastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, U.S.A.,\nE-mail address: j.sokoloff@neu.edu\nNovember 21, 2018\nAbstract\nIt is shown using a method based on a modified version of the\nmean field theory of Miklavic Marcelja that it should be possible for\nosmotic pressure due to the counterions associated with the two polyelectrolyte polymer brush coated surfaces to support a reasonable load\n(i.e., about 106 P a) with the brushes held sufficiently far apart to prevent entanglement of polymers belonging to the two brushes, thus\navoiding what is believed to be the dominant mechanisms for static\nand dry friction.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolymer brush coatings on solid surfaces provide very effective lubrication,\nin the sense that they are able to support significant load (pushing the surfaces together), but have exceedingly low friction coefficients[1]. Human and\nanimal joints are known to exhibit very low friction and wear. The outer\nsurface of the cartilage coating these joints have polymeric molecules protruding from them[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. This suggests the\nstrong possibility that their very effective lubrication is a result of polymer\nbrush lubrication. It has been shown that at small loads, polymer brush\n1\n\n\fcoated surfaces can slide relative to each other with the bulk of the brushes\nnot in contact[15]. If the surfaces are far enough apart under such loads,\nthe load will be supported almost entirely by osmotic pressure due to a dilute concentration of polymers that protrude into the thin interface region\nseparating the brushes. As a consequence, there will be little entanglement\nof the polymers belonging to the two brushes (i.e., penetration of polymers\nbelonging to one brush into the second brush). It was argued in Ref. [15]\nthat such entanglement of polymer brushes leads to static and kinetic friction\nthat saturates at a nonzero value in the limit of zero sliding velocity (i.e., dry\nfriction) of polymer brush coated surfaces. It is reasonable to expect that\nthere should be little wear as well when there is little entanglement.\nThe discussion in Ref. [15] deals with static and slow speed kinetic friction, and not the purely viscous kinetic friction that occurs at high sliding\nspeeds. Since the polymers hyaloronan or lubricin, which coat the cartilage in\nhuman and animal joints[16], are charged, it is necessary to consider polyelectrolyte brushes, whose equilibrium properties have been studied using mean\nfield theory by Zhulina, et. al.[17], Misra[18] and Miklavic[19], and Pincus\nand Tamashiro, et. al.[20]. Raviv, et. al.[21], have found that polyelectrolyte\nbrushes exhibit remarkably low friction coefficients (10\u22123 or less) compared to\nthe friction coefficients typically found for neutral polymer brushes[1, 22, 23].\nIt is proposed in the present article that polyelectrolyte polymer brushes are\nmore effective lubricants than neutral polymer brushes discussed above because, as will be shown, counterion osmotic pressure present in a relatively\nthin interface region separating two polymer brushes is able to support a load\nof the order of 106 P a (which is comparable to the loads supported by the\npolyelectrolyte brushes studied in Ref. [21]), without the tops of the bulk\npart of the density profiles of the brushes being in contact, as illustrated in\nFig. 1. The height of a neutral polymer brush is determined by a competition\nbetween the polymer's elasticity (of entropic origin) and the mutual repulsion\nthat occurs in a good solvent between the monomers making up the polymers of the brush. For polyelectrolyte brushes, the counterion entropy[20]\nalso plays a significant role in stretching the polymers in the brush.\nThe present treatment of lubrication due to polyelectrolyte brushes is\nbased on the theory of Miklavic and Marcelja[19], which is an extension\nof the analytic mean field theory due to Milner, et. al.[24]. As has been\nshown in several treatments of the subject[25], using numerical treatments\nof mean field theory and molecular dynamics[26], the analytic treatment of\nmean field theory[24] is only accurate for relatively stiff polymer brushes, for\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: The geometry of two polyelectrolyte polymer brush coated surfaces\nwith the load pushing the surfaces together supported by osmotic pressure\ndue to counterions in the interface regions separating the tops of the brushes\nis illustrated schematically. The dots located among the polymer chains and\nin the interface region between the two brushes represent the counterions.\nAs illustrated here, D denotes the spacing of the surfaces and h denotes the\npolymer brush height.\n\n3\n\n\fwhich the brush height is large compared to the unswollen single polymer\nradius of gyration N 1/2 a, where a is the monomer length. Since for good\nsolvents this is a useful limit to consider, a treatment based on analytic\nmean field theory is expected to give accurate results in the important case\nof relatively dense polymer brushes with relatively strong repulsions between\ntheir monomers, as well as for polyelectrolytes for which counterion osmotic\npressure within the brushes provides strong forces to keep the polymers in\nthe brush well stretched[20]. Furthermore, analytic mean field theory shows\nimportant trends as the brushes are compressed[15], which are consistent\nwith experiment. Therefore, a theoretical study of lubrication by polymer\nbrushes based on mean field theory is expected to be a good starting point\nin an effort to understand lubricating properties of polymer brushes. In\nsection 2, it is argued that the method of estimating the mean distance that\na polymer belonging to one of the brushes is able to extend into the interface\nregion separating the two brushes, used for neutral polymer brushes, applies\nequally well to polyelectrolyte brushes, when they are sufficiently compressed,\nand this distance is estimated. If the interface region separating the tops of\nthe brushes is wider than this distance, polymers from one brush will be\nunlikely to penetrate into the second. In section 3, the question of how much\nload can be supported by counterion osmotic pressure (with the brushes held\nsufficiently far apart to prevent the occurrence of static friction) is studied.\nIn an effort to determine a possible mechanism for the ultra-low friction\nfound in Ref. [21], an approximate solution for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation beyond the Debye-Huckel approximation will be used to determine the\nconcentration of counterions in a region located midway between the two\npolyelectrolyte brushes. This result is used to show that for polyelectrolyte\nbrushes, osmotic pressure due to the counterions is capable of supporting\nabout 106 P a of load, even with the tops of the mean field theoretic monomer\nprofiles of the two brushes about 14Ao apart. In fact, it will be shown that\nthis result is valid even for salt concentrations smaller than but still comparable to 0.1 M (about 1026 m\u22123 ), the salt concentration in living matter.\nIncreasing the salt concentration further, however, will put the system in a\nregime in which Debye-Huckel (D-H) approximation is accurate and predicts\nthat the ion concentration mid-way between the brushes is negligibly small\nonce the D-H screening length is much smaller than the width of the interface\nregion.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nEstimate of the Brush spacing for which\nStatic Friction due to Brush Entanglement\nwill Not Occur\n\nPart of Ref. [15] relevant to the present discussion is briefly summarized\nin this paragraph. Milner, et. al.[24], proposed a simple way to solve the\nmean field theory analytically for neutral polymers attached at one end to a\nsurface. In this treatment, the location of the nth monomer of the ith polymer\nbelonging to a polymer brush of minimum free energy, ri (n) satisfies the\ndifferential equation\nd2 ri (n)\n= \u2207V (ri (n)),\n(1)\ndn2\nwhere V (ri (n)) = w\u03c6(ri(n)), and where for neutral brushes, \u03c6(r) is the\nmonomer number density and w is the strength of the monomer-monomer\nrepulsion parameter. This can be thought of as an \"equation of motion\" for\nthe monomers, in which the index n labeling the monomers formally plays\nthe role of time. It is formally analogous to Newton's second law for motion\nof a particle in a potential equal to V (r(n)). Existence of a solution of the\nmean field equations of motion requires that V (r(n)) be a parabolic function\nof z [24]. In Ref. [15] it was shown that when two polymer brushes are\nin contact with each other or nearly in contact, polymers belonging to one\nbrush can penetrate into the second brush. As a consequence, there is a force\nof static friction equal to the force needed to pull these intertangled polymers out. The force of static friction per intertangled polymer was argued\nto be equal to kB T /\u03be, where \u03be is the mesh size of one of the two polymer\nbrushes. The magnitude of the friction was estimated in Ref. [15] to be of\nthe order of 103 P a or more. Even when the applied force is below this value,\nthe surfaces will not remain truly stationary, but rather, will creep relative\nto each other. The reason for this behavior is that the intertangled polymers\nwill diffuse out in a diffusion or reptation time \u03c4 . It was shown that at high\ncompression \u03c4 can be sufficiently long to consider this to be a true force of\nstatic friction. If a force greater than this static friction force is applied, and\nhence, the surfaces slide with a speed much greater than this creep speed,\nsince the polymers will no longer have enough time to re-entangle in the\nsecond brush, the friction will no longer be determined by this mechanism.\nInstead, there will be viscous friction resulting from the fact that the solvent gets sheared as the surfaces slide. This viscous friction force per unit\n5\n\n\fsurface area in the slow sliding speed limit is given by \u03b7(v/lp ), where \u03b7 is\nthe viscosity of the solvent, v is the sliding velocity[27] and lp is the hydrodynamic penetration length into the brushes.[28]. Let us consider sliding\nspeeds that are sufficiently slow so that the zero sliding speed configuration\nof the polymers is not significantly disturbed. For uncompressed polymer\nbrushes, which have a parabolic density profile[24], lp is comparable to the\nequilibrium brush height[28], but for brushes which are compressed because\nthey are supporting a load, the density profile will get flattened out, and as\na consequence, lp can be comparable to the polymer spacing at the surface\nto which they are attached, s. Then, for example, assuming the solvent to be\nwater, for v=1 mm/s, the largest speed used in the experiment, the force of\nfriction per unit area for the uncompressed brush case will be approximately\nequal to about a P a, for brushes of equilibrium height of the order of 500Ao .\nFor compressed brushes with an anchor spacing s of 84Ao , it will be about\n5 times this value. This estimate is an upper bound on the shear stress,\nsince it assumes no-slip boundary conditions for the fluid at the polymers\nand the surface. For plate spacing just above the maximum separation for\nwhich the friction observed is above the experimental accuracy (reported in\nRef. [23]), the load is reported to be F/R=0.01N/m (where R is the radius of\nthe cylinders in the surface force apparatus, which is about 0.01 m), which,\nusing the standard Hertz formula[29], gives a contact area for the surface\nforce apparatus of about 10\u221210 m\u22122 . The maximum observable shear force in\nthis experiment is 0.25\u03bcN, which when divided by the above contact area\ngives a shear stress from the experimental data of about 104 P a, clearly well\nabove the shear stress of about a P a found above for viscous friction. Hence\nthe viscous friction discussed above is clearly well below the experimentally\nobserved kinetic friction. In contrast, Eq. (16) in Ref. [15] shows that it\nis easy to get a value for the static friction or slow speed kinetic friction,\ndue to the polymer blob entanglement mechanism discussed earlier, comparable or greater than the experimental value if the brushes are sufficiently\ncompressed.\nAn important advantage of polyelectrolyte over neutral polymer brushes\nas lubricants is that the osmotic pressure due to counterions might, under\nthe right conditions be able to support the load, allowing the brush coated\nsurfaces to slide without the bulk of the brushes being in actual contact,\nand hence, with negligible friction due to entanglement of polymers from\none brush in the second. In order to calculate the separation of the two\nbrushes above which friction due to this entanglement no longer occurs and\n6\n\n\fto calculate the contribution to the repulsion of two polyelectrolyte brushes\ndue to osmotic pressure due to the counterions at this separation, we will\nuse an analytic mean field theory treatment of polyelectrolyte brushes based\non the treatment due to Miklavic and Marcelja[19]. In their treatment they\nuse the mean field treatment of Ref. [24] with V (r) = w\u03c6(r) + e\u03c8(r), where\n\u03c8(r) is the electrostatic potential, due to the charged polymers making up\nthe brush, screened by the counterions divided by the electronic charge e,\nwhich satisfies Poisson's equation\nd2 \u03c8\n= 4\u03c0\u03c1(z)/e \u2212 (4\u03c0f /\u01eb)\u03c6(z),\ndz 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1(z) is the ionic charge density, z is the distance from the lower surface,\n\u03c6(z) is the monomer density profile of the brush (or brushes, if there are two\nof them in contact or nearly in contact) and f is the charge in units of the\nelectron charge e per monomer. In contrast to Ref. [19], in the present treatment of this problem, the Debye-Huckel approximation will not be used when\nestimates of the osmotic pressure due to counterions are made. The charge\nper monomer f has a maximum value because of Manning condensation[30].\nIf the charge spacing on the polymer is less than the Bjerrum length, there\nwill be Manning condensation[30], which means that some of the counterions will condense onto the polymer, until its charge density is reduced to\nthe point that the charge spacing becomes equal to a Bjerrum length for\nmonovalent counterions. Then, since the Bjerrum length, lB = e2 /(\u01ebkB T )\nis 7.1 Angstroms for a solvent with a dielectric constant comparable to that\nof water, the largest possible value of f is the ratio of a monomer spacing\nto a Bjerrum length, or 0.35, if we assume the value for the monomer spacing from Ref. [21] of 2.5Ao . Since we want the polymer brushes to behave\nas polymer brushes in a good solvent, we want the charge per monomer to\nbe sufficiently small so that there are not too many counterions condensed\non the polymers, in order to prevent possible collapse of the brushes due to\ninteraction of dipole moments resulting from counterions condensed on the\ncharged monomers[32]. Milner, et. al. [24] and Miklavic and Marcelja[19]\nshow that in mean field theory the height of the nth monomer on a polymer\nin a brush, zn satisfies the differential equation\nd2 zn /dn2 = (a2 /kB T )(\u2202V (zn )/\u2202zn ),\n\n(3a)\n\nwhere for polyelectrolyte brushes V (zn ) is the potential acting on the nth\nmonomer, due in the present case to both hard core intermonomer forces\n7\n\n\fand electrostatic forces. In order to have a self-consistent solution to Eq.\n(3a), V (z) must have the form A \u2212 Bz 2 , where A and B are constants[24].\nLet us now estimate effects of fluctuations from mean field theory by a\nmethod similar to the methods of Ref. [24]. If j1 monomers belonging to\na polymer are either pulled out or thermally fluctuate out of a brush, the\nsolution for zn as a function of n becomes for zn \u2264 h\nzn = (h/cos(\u03c9j1 ))cos(\u03c9n),\n\n(3b)\n\nusing Eq. (5b) of Ref. [15] and requiring that zj1 = h, where j1 is the value\nof n such that for n < j1 , zn > h[15]. For zn > h the \"force\" in the \"equation\nof motion\" is no longer determined by \u2212(A \u2212 Bz 2 ), but by the electrostatic\npotential \u03c8(z) outside of the brush, which is a smooth function of z. Then\nfor n < j1 , zn is given by zn = f (n), where f (n) represents the solution to the\n\"equation of motion\" with the potential given by the value of \u2212\u03c8(z) outside\nthe brush instead of \u2212(A \u2212 Bz 2 ). If j1 << N (a condition for the validity\nof mean field theory), we may expand f(n) to lowest order in n for n < j1 .\nHence,\nh = zj1 = f (j1 ) \u2248 f (0) + f \u2032 (0)j1 = z0 + f \u2032 (0)j1 ,\nor\nz0 = h \u2212 f \u2032 (0)j1 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe assumption made here that zn is a slowly varying function of n in the\nregion outside the brushes is valid since the distance over which the electrostatic potential varies is of the order of the thickness of the interface region\nseparating the brushes and the distance that the polymers belonging to a\nbrush stick out into this region is smaller than this distance, because we have\nchosen to consider the situation in which the spacing between the brushes is\ngreater than the distance that the polymers belonging to a brush protrude\ninto this region. We must require that dzn /dn be continuous at n = j1 . It\nfollows from Eq. (3) that\ndzn\n|n=0 \u2248 f \u2032 (0) = \u2212h\u03c9tan(\u03c9j1 ) \u2248 \u2212h\u03c9 2 j1 .\ndn\n\n(5)\n\nThis implies that z0 \u2248 h + h\u03c9 2 j12 , and hence, dz0 = 2h\u03c9 2j1 dj1 . As in Ref.\n[15], we use the fact that (kB T /a2 )(dzn /dn)|n=0 is the tension that must be\napplied to the free end of the polymer in order to pull it out of the brush\n\n8\n\n\fto calculate the work needed to pull j1 monomers of this polymer out of the\nbrush,\nZ z0\n2\n\u2206F = ((kB T /a )\n(dzn /dn)|n=0dz0 =\nh\n\n(2/3)kB T (h\u03c9 2 /a)2 j13 .\n\n(6)\n\nFrom Eq. (5) we obtain the probability that j1 monomers stick out of the\npolymer into the interface region,\nP \u221d exp(\u2212(2/3)(h\u03c9 2 /a)2 j13 )\n\n(7)\n\nor using the fact that h\u03c9 2 j12 = z0 \u2212 h [which is given under Eq. (5)], we find\nthat\nz0 \u2212 h 3/2\nP \u221d exp[\u2212(\n) ],\n(8)\n\u03be\nwhere \u03be/h = (3/\u03c0)2/3 (N 1/2 a/h)4/3 . We expect that we will get extremely low\nfriction, only if the polymers that fluctuate out of one brush do not extend so\nfar that they get entangled in the second polyelectrolyte brush, because that\nwill result in static friction and relatively large nonviscous kinetic friction[15].\nFor D \u22122h = z0 \u2212h >> \u03be, there will be no static friction due to entanglement\nof polymers belonging to one brush in the second. Using the parameters\nN=115, a = 2.5Ao and h = 170Ao from Ref. [21] in the formula for \u03be under\nEq. (8), we find that we must have z0 \u2212 h \u2265 \u03be \u2248 14.4Ao . In fact, numerical\nwork on neutral polymer brushes[25, 26] shows that the monomer density\nis generally quite small in the tails on the monomer density distribution of\nlength \u03be, implied by Eq. (8), and there is every reason to assume that the\nsame will be true for charged polymers as well, making it likely that it is\nnot necessary for z0 \u2212 h to be much larger than \u03be in order for the monomer\ndensity in the tails to be in the dilute regime[15], in which friction due to\nblob entanglement does not occur.\nThe model discussed in this section assumes that the polyelectrolyte\nbrushes have a height which is a relatively small fraction of the fully stretched\nlength of the polymers, as is the case for neutral polymer brushes. This would\nbe the case only for polyelectrolyte brushes for which the charge on the polymers is a very small fraction of the maximum charge allowed by Manning\ntheory[30], or for polymers with a higher charge but carrying a high load,\nso that the brush heights are compressed to a small fraction of the heights\nexpected for uncompressed brushes on the basis of Pincus' arguments[20].\n9\n\n\fFor highly charged polyelectrolyte brushes under light loads, for which the\npolymers are extended to close to their fully extended length, the high degree of entanglement needed to give the static and relatively high kinetic\nfriction discussed in Ref. [15] for neutral brushes is unlikely. In fact, it was\nargued earlier that this is likely to be the reason that experimental studies\nof polymer brushes[23] show that the friction is negligible until the brushes\nare under relatively high loads.\n\n3\n\nLoad Carrying Ability of Polyelectrolyte Brushes\nin the Low Salt Concentration Limit\n\nSince in the absence of excess salt, the conterion contribution to the osmotic\npressure falls off quite slowly with plate separation[20], the possibility will be\nexplored here that a reasonably large load can be supported by counterion\nosmotic pressure while the plates are sufficiently far apart to prevent entanglement of the polymers belonging to the two brushes. Therefore, let us now\nconsider the situation in which there is a sufficiently low concentration of excess salt. In this situation, we must use solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation beyond the Debye-Huckel approximation, since that approximation\ndoes not accurately describe the problem[20, 35]. Let us first consider the\nsituation in which there is no excess salt, and only counterions are present.\nIn the interface region (i.e., h < z < D \u2212 h), the electrostatic potential must\nbe a solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation\nd2 \u03c8/dz 2 = \u22124\u03c0n0 lB elB \u03c8 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere n0 is the counter-ion density midway between the plates, i.e., at z=D/2\n[35]. The solution to Eq. (9) for this geometry in the interface region between\nthe two polymer brushes may be used to estimate the counterion contribution\nto the osmotic pressure supporting the load. The two polymer brushes may\nbe formally replaced by two equally charged flat plates a distance D-2h apart\nif we impose the boundary condition that \u2212d\u03c8/dz|z=h = \u03c3e as required by\nGauss's law, where \u03c3e is the total charge (polymer charge plus counterion\ncharge) contained within the brush (i.e., in the region 0 < z < h). This\nsolution is[35]\n2\n\u03c8 = l\u22121\n(10)\nB log(cos k0 (z \u2212 D/2)),\n\n10\n\n\fwhere k02 = 2\u03c0n0 lB , and the counterion density is given by\nn = no e\u2212lB \u03c8 =\nSince\n\nZ\n\nD\u2212h\n\nh\n\ndzn(z) = n0\n\nZ\n\ncos2 k\nD\u2212h\n\nh\n\nn0\n.\n0 (z \u2212 D/2)\n\n(11)\n\ndz\n=\ncos2 k0 (z \u2212 D/2)\n\n(2n0 /k0 )tank0 (D/2 \u2212 h) = 2\u03c3e ,\n\n(12)\n\ntank0 (D/2 \u2212 h) = k0 \u03c3e /n0 ,\n\n(13)\n\nfor k0 \u03c3e /n0 >> 1, we get the maximum possible value of k0 , which gives the\nmaximum value of n0 , namely, k0 = [\u03c0/(D \u2212 2h)]. From the definition of k0\nbelow Eq. (10), it follows that the largest possible value of\nn0 = (\u03c0/2)\n\n1\n,\nlB (D \u2212 2h)2\n\n(14)\n\nwhich gives for the counterion contribution to the osmotic pressure\nPosm = kB T ni = (\u03c0/2)\n\nkB T\n.\nlB (D \u2212 2h)2\n\n(15)\n\nFor a value of the parameter D-2h, comparable to \u03be, estimated in section\n2, or about 14.4A0 , we find that Posm = 2.7 \u00d7 106 N/m2 , and it is inversely\nproportional to the square of the spacing between the tops of the brushes,\ni.e., the width of the interface region.\nIn order to determine if the right hand side of Eq. (13) is much greater\nthan one [which is the condition for the validity of Eqs. (14) and (15)],\nEq. (2) will now be integrated, in order to determine whether a value of n0\n(and corresponding value for the osmotic pressure given above for the region\nseparating the tops of the brushes) comparable to the value given above will\noccur. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation [Eq. (2)] for the case of no excess\nsalt can be written as[20]\nd2 \u03c6\u0304\n= \u22124\u03c0lB [n0 e\u2212\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 f \u03c6(z)],\ndz 2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0304 = lB \u03c8. In order to make it possible to integrate Eq. (16), we\nwill approximate the monomer density of a brush \u03c6(z) by the step function\n11\n\n\f\u03c6(z) = (N/h)\u03c3\u03b8(h \u2212 z), where \u03b8(x) = 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0. This\nis a reasonable approximation because we are considering polymer brushes\nwhich are compressed because they are supporting a load, and under such\ncircumstances, the parabolic density profile of the uncompressed brush gets\nflattened into a form that is not too different from the step function form\ngiven above[15, 24]. Multiplying Eq. (16) by d\u03c6\u0304/dz and integrating, we get\n(\n\nd\u03c6\u0304 2\nd\u03c6\u0304\n) = ( |z=h )2 +\ndz\ndz\n\n8\u03c0lB n0 (e\u2212\u03c6\u0304(z) \u2212 e\u2212\u03c6\u0304(h) ) + (8\u03c0lB N\u03c3f /h)[\u03c6\u0304(z) \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(h)] =\n8\u03c0lB n0 (e\u2212\u03c6\u0304(z) \u2212 1) + 8\u03c0lB N\u03c3f /h[\u03c6\u0304(z) \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(h)],\n\n(17)\n\nfor z between 0 and h, using Eqs. (10-13) to simplify this expression. For\nz > h, \u03c6\u0304(z) = ln(cos2 k0 (z \u2212 D/2), the solution described in Eqs. (10-13)[35].\nThus, Eq. (17) leads to the integral\nZ\n\n\u03c6\u0304(z)\n\n\u03c6\u0304(h)\n\nd\u03c6\u0304\n= 2k0 (z \u2212 h)\n[(e\u2212\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 1) + r(\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(h)]1/2\n= 2\u03b1\n\nz\u2212h\nD/2 \u2212 h\n\n(18)\n\nfor z < h, where r = K02 /k02 , where K02 = 2\u03c0lB f N/(hs2 ), the square of the\ninverse screening length within a brush, where N is the number of monomers\nin a single polymer and s is the mean spacing of the polymers of one brush\nalong the surface to which they are attached and \u03b1 = k0 (D/2\u2212h). Evaluation\nof this integral allows us to obtain \u03c6\u0304(z), if we know k0 . The total charge\nbetween the plates consists of the sum of the charge on the polyelectrolyte\nbrushes and the counterion charge, is zero. Applying Gauss's law, using\nthe fact that symmetry demands that the electric fields at both plates are\nequal in magnitude and opposite in direction, we find that the electric field\nat the plates is zero, if no counterions condense on the surfaces at z=0 and\nz=D. Then, we must demand that at the location of the lower plate, z=0,\nd\u03c6\u0304(z)/dz = 0. (It is clearly also zero at z=D by symmetry.) We can find\n\u03c6\u0304(z = 0) by setting z=0 in Eq. (17), and setting d\u03c6\u0304(z)/dz|z=0 = 0. (Strictly\nspeaking, this condition is only precisely correct if the surfaces belong to thick\nsolids, so that there can be no solution present inside these solid blocks. If\nthis were not the case, d\u03c6\u0304(z)/dz would not be required to vanish at precisely\n12\n\n\f50\n\nf1,f2\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\ndimensionless potential\n\nFigure 2: The functions f 1 = e\u2212\u03c6\u0304(0) \u2212 1 and f 2 = r(\u03c6\u0304(D/2 \u2212 h) \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(0) are\nplotted versus the dimensionless potential \u03c6\u0304(0) for r=11. All quantities are\ndimensionless.\nz=0, but rather approximately at a short screening distance below z=0. The\nresults are not expected to be modified qualitatively from what we will find\nin this section if we were to take this into account, however. In any case, this\nis not an important case for most applications, because there is normally no\nsolution on the outer side of the two surfaces because there is normally solid\nmaterial located there.) Using the value of \u03c6\u0304(0) found in this way, we may\nthen determine k0 by integrating Eq. (18) with z=0. From the definitions of\nk0 and K0 under Eqs. (10) and (18), respectively, the ratio r = (K0 /k0 )2 is\nequal to the ratio of the unscreened charge density, f N/(hs2 ), of the polymer\nbrush to n0 . A graphical solution for \u03c6\u0304(0) is illustrated in Fig. (2) for a\nreasonably large value of r = (K0 /k0 )2 . We must have K0 /k0 \u2265 1. This is\nevident from the fact that (as is seen in Fig. 2) for K0 /k0 < 1 we cannot\nfind a solution for \u03c6\u0304(0) from Eq. (17) by setting d\u03c6\u0304(z)/dz|z=0 = 0. We see\nthat for any value of r > 1, there exist two solutions for \u03c6\u0304(0), one with\n\u03c6\u0304(0) close to \u03c6\u0304(h) and one with |\u03c6\u0304(0)| > |\u03c6\u0304(h)|. Since in the large r limit,\nwe expect the charge residing on the polymers within the polymer brushes\nto be highly screened, we do not expect \u03c6\u0304(0) and \u03c6\u0304(h) to differ by very\nmuch. Therefore, the solution with \u03c6\u0304(0) comparable to \u03c6\u0304(h) is the physically\ncorrect solution and the solution with |\u03c6\u0304(0)| > |\u03c6\u0304(h)| is rejected as being an\n13\n\n\funphysical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.\nEq. (18) can be integrated numerically. In order to facilitate this, following the discussion in appendix A of the second article in Ref. [20], we\nfirst integrate Eq.

Several solutions of Eq. (20)\nare given in table I. In each case, we chose the largest value of \u03b1 for which\nthere is a solution to Eq. (18) with z=0 for which d\u03c6\u0304(z)/dz|z=0 = 0. It was\nfound to be difficult to find a solution for D/2 \u2212 h < h. It is clear that it\nmust be possible to have solutions to Eq. (20) with D/2 \u2212 h < h. It is clear,\nhowever, that in order to have a solution to Eq. (18) with D/2 \u2212 h < h,\nthe left hand side of this equation must be greater than 1, unless \u03b1 is small,\nand we already saw for small values of \u03b1, Eq. (20) gives values of (D/2h)/h which are greater than 1. For reasonably large values of r, the only\nway that this can occur is if there is a large contribution to the integral\nfrom \u03c6\u0304 close to \u03c6\u0304(0), where the integrand has an integrable singularity. Let\nus then examine the contribution to the integral in Eq. (18) for this part\nof the range of integration. To accomplish this, we write \u03c6\u0304 = \u03c6\u0304(0) + \u03c6\u2032 and\nperform the integral over a range of \u03c6\u2032 which is small compared to \u03c6\u0304(h)\u2212 \u03c6\u0304(0).\nThen this contribution to the integral can be performed by expanding the\nfunction under the radical sign in the denominator of the integrand in a\nTaylor series to second order in \u03c6\u2032 , giving f (\u03c6\u0304) = e\u2212\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 1 + r(\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(h)) \u2248\ndf /d\u03c6\u0304|\u03c6\u0304=\u03c6\u0304(0) \u03c6\u2032 + (1/2)d2f /d\u03c6\u03042 |\u03c6\u0304=\u03c6\u0304(0) \u03c6\u20322 . Using this, the contribution to the\nintegral in Eq. (18) for \u03c6\u0304 close to \u03c6\u0304(0) can be written as\n\u0393\u22121/2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c61\n\nd\u03c6\u2032\n\u2248 \u0393\u22121/2 [ln(2(\u03c61 )) \u2212 ln(\u03b4/2)],\n[\u03c6\u20322 + \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 ]1/2\n14\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere \u0393 = (1/2)d2f /d\u03c6\u03042 |\u03c6\u0304=\u03c6\u0304(0) , \u0393\u03b4 = df /d\u03c6\u0304|\u03c6\u0304=\u03c6\u0304(0) and \u03b4 << \u03c61 << \u03c6\u0304(h) \u2212\n\u03c6\u0304(0). From the definition of \u03b4, we see that \u03b4 = e\u03c6\u0304(0) df /d\u03c6\u0304|\u03c6\u0304=\u03c6\u0304(0) and since\nf (\u03c6\u0304) = f 1 \u2212 f 2, defined in Fig. 2, we see that \u03b4 becomes smaller and smaller\nas the curves f1 and f2 in Fig. 2 become more and more nearly tangent\nat \u03c6\u0304 = \u03c6\u0304(0). From Eq. (21), we see that we can make (D/2 \u2212 h)/h as\nsmall as we wish by making \u03b4 smaller [and hence making the curves closer\nto being tangent at their point of intersection at \u03c6\u0304(0)]. For example, for\nthe value of \u03b2 = 1.17, which we argued earlier to be appropriate for the\npolyelectrolyte brushes studied in Ref. [21], we find that the curves will be\nnearly tangent for \u03b1 slightly larger than 0.65. This value of \u03b1 corresponds\nto n0 = [0.65/(2\u03c0)]/[lB (D/2 \u2212 h)2 ] = 0.7 \u00d7 1026 m\u22123 . Thus, we conclude that\nthe density of counterions residing between the tops of the two brushes is\nsufficient to provide enough osmotic pressure to support a load of kB T n0 =\n0.28 \u00d7 106 P a for the polyelectrolyte brushes studied in Ref. [21].\nThe degree of compression can be estimated from the discussion in Ref.\n[20].

The main\nconclusion of this treatment relevant to the present work is that this model\npredicts that under such circumstances, for highly charged polyelectrolyte\nbrushes practically all of the counterions lie inside the brushes. The reason\nfor this is that if we assume that there are no hard core interactions between\nthe monomers in the brushes (i.e., there are only electrostatic and counterion\nentropic interactions), the mean field potential is identically equal to the electrostatic potential energy of the monomers, which is equal to f e\u03c8(r). Since\nthe mean field potential must have the form A \u2212 Bz 2 [24], the net charge\ndensity in units of the electron charge e (due to both monomer and counterion charge) is given by \u2212(\u01eb/f e2 )d2 \u03c8/dz 2 = (2\u01eb/f e2 )B = \u03c0 2 /(8f lB a2 N 2 ),\na constant. Since the product of this charge density and the volume of the\nbrush must be equal in magnitude to the total amount of counter ion charge\noutside the brush (in units of e), for monovalent counterions, the number\nof counterions outside two brushes in contact with each other is equal to\n\u03c0 2 hs2 (8f lB a2 N 2 ). Then, clearly for highly compressed (i.e., h << f 1/2 Na\nand obviously s << f 1/2 Na) and highly charged polymers (i.e., f \u2248 1), this\nmodel predicts that there are practically no counterions outside the brushes.\nThis model predicts that for highly compressed polyelectrolyte brushes, i.e.,\nbrushes with heights h << f 1/2 Na (see Fig. 8 in Ref. [33]), the density\nprofiles will approximate a step function and the tops of the two brushes will\nnever be in contact (i.e. D > 2h). Hence, there will always be a thin interface region free of monomers separating the two brushes, but the thickness\nof this region will be negligibly small (i.e., less than 1Ao ), in order to support\na load as high as 105 P a. This would imply on the basis of the arguments\ngiven in section 2, that highly compressed polymer brushes should exhibit\na good deal of friction due to entanglement of blobs belonging to one brush\nin the second brush. (How the scaling arguments of Ref. [15] are modified\n16\n\n\fwhen the polymer interactions are replaced due to electrostatic, rather than\nhard core, interactions will be discussed in a future publication[34].\nHence, the calculations presented in the previous paragraph must give\nresults consistent with Ref. [33] when (D \u2212 2h)/D << 1. In order to make\ncontact between Ref. [33] and the Poisson-Bltzmann equation calculations\npresented in the previous section, let us do such a calculation for an example with (D \u2212 2h)/D << 1 with some reasonable parameters. Consider\n(K0 D/2)2 = 2\u03c0lB (2f N/(\u03c0 1/2 hs2 )D 2 , which for lB = 7Ao , f N = 103 Ao ,\ns = 102 Ao and h \u2248 D/2 \u2248 102 Ao , we get K0 D = 15.8. The solution to\nEq. (18) for (D \u2212 2h)/D = 0.001 gives k0 D/2 = 15.79, which implies that\nn0 is only slightly smaller than the unscreened monomer charge density inside a brush and \u03c6\u0304(h) \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(0) = 0.262, which implies that \u03c6\u0304(z) varies by\na relatively small fraction as z varies from 0 to h, which is consistent with\nthe calculation of Zhulina and Borisov[33]. An alternative way to view this\nis the following: In Zhulina and Borisov's solution of mean field theory[33],\nhighly charged polyelectrolyte brushes have practically no net charge inside\nthe brushes, meaning that the counterion density inside the brush is nearly\nequal to the unscreened polymer charge density, as shown above. Consequently since the counterion density is continuous as we cross over from\ninside to outside the brush, k0 is only slightly less than K0 . Since (K0 /k0 )2 is\nequal to the ratio of n0 , the counterion density midway between the brushes,\nto the charge density of the unscreened polymers inside the brushes, we may\nwrite (K0 /k0 )2 = 1 + \u2206n/n, where \u2206n is the net charge density inside the\nbrushes, and n is the unscreened polymer charge density. Since \u2206n/n << 1,\nEq. (18) reduces to\ntank0 (D/2 \u2212 h) \u2248 k0 h(\u2206n/n)\n\n(24)\n\nto lowest order in \u2206n/n. Since the right hand side of Eq. (18) is much less\nthan 1, the tangent may be approximated by its argument, and hence we\nfind from Eq. (24) that\nD/2 \u2212 h \u2248 h(\u2206n/n).\n\n(25)\n\nFrom the discussion above, we know that \u2206n = \u03c0 2 /(8f lB a2 N 2 ). The unscreened polymer charge density is f N/(s2 h). Using the same values for f,\nlB , a, N and h as were used above we estimate that\nD/2 \u2212 h)/(D/2) \u2248 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n17\n\n(26)\n\n\fThus, there exist two treatments of highly charged compressed polyelectrolyte brushes, which appear to give opposite results. One predicts that\npolyelectrolyte brushes should be able to slide with their load supported\nby osmotic pressure in a region separating the tops of the brushes which is\nrelatively free of monomers of sufficient thickness to prevent polymer entanglement of the type that was proposed in ref. [15] to give relatively high\nfriction compared to the viscous friction considered in section II and one\nwhich predicts that the load will be supported by osmotic pressure in a region separating the brushes which is extremely thin. The latter would imply\nthat there should always be a good deal of friction due to blob entanglement\nwhen h << f 1/2 Na, on the basis of Ref. [15]. Let us now explain this apparent contradiction. When the polymer charge is relatively high (i.e., f is\nclose to 1), Zhulina and Borisov solution of mean field theory can only be\nvalid if the brushes are somewhat compressed, because if the brushes are as\nstretched as far as Pincus's treatment[20] implies, the elastic free energy of\nthe polymers used in Ref. [33] is not valid for highly extended polymers.\nWhen the brushes are compressed to heights comparable to the heights that\nthey would have if the polymers were neutral, the hard core repulsion of the\nmonomers will play a role comparable to that of the electrostatic interactions. Although mean field theory requires that the sum of the hard core\ninteraction and electrostatic interaction potentials be equal to A \u2212 Bz 2 , with\nthe constant B having the value given earlier, the electrostatic interaction\npotential alone need not have this form. In fact, when the brushes are highly\ncompressed (compared to the nearly fully extended brush height bound in\nRef. [20]) down to a height comparable to what one finds for neutral brushes,\nthe hard core potential might dominate. In such a case, the electrostatic potential is certainly not constrained to have the above form. Rather, it will\nbe determined completely by the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using a monomer density profile, determined primarily by the hard core\ninteraction contribution to mean field theory, in which case a solution like\nthe one found in section III is likely to be valid. Whether or not the polyelectrolyte brushes are so highly compressed that hard core interaction plays\na dominant role, the density profile of polymer brushes formed from finite\nlength polymers will have significant deviations from mean field theory in\nthe form of tails of length l << h at the edges of the brushes. This will\ncertainly require that the mean field potential differ from the parabolic from\nrequired by mean field theory[24] at the edges of the brushes (i.e., near z=h)\nover a region of thickness of the order of l. Then the electric charge density\n18\n\n\fobtained by differentiating the electrostatic potential twice will have a charge\ndensity which is much larger than that found be Zhulina and Borisov[33] in\nthis region, resulting in a considerably larger net charge of the polymer brush\nthan that found in Ref. [33].\n\n5\n\nEffects of Excess Salt\n\nWhen there is excess salt present in the solvent, Eq. (16) gets replaced by[35]\nd2 \u03c6\u0304\n= \u22124\u03c0lB [ns (e\u2212\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 e+\u03c6\u0304 ) \u2212 f \u03c6(z)],\ndz 2\n\n(27)\n\nwhere ns represents the salt concentration and the second exponential term\non the right hand side represents the contribution of ions with the same\ncharge as the brushes to the ionic charge between the plates. For the case of\nno excess salt, described by Eq. (16), \u03c6\u0304(z) was taken to be zero at z=D/2.\nIn contrast, for the case of excess salt, described by Eq. (20), \u03c6\u0304(z) is usually\ntaken to be zero well outside the two surfaces. For a low concentration of\nexcess salt, the conditions under which Eq. (20) takes the same form as Eq.\n(16) will be examined using simple physical arguments, which give results\nwhich are identical to those obtained in appendix A from the exact solution\nto the Poisson-Boltzmann equation of the second article in Ref. [20]. In order\nto accomplish this, let us write \u03c6\u0304(z) as \u03c6\u0304(z) = \u03c60 + \u03c6\u2032 (z) where \u03c60 = \u03c6\u0304(D/2)\nand \u03c6\u2032 (z) is zero at z=D/2. Then, we can make Eq. (27) look like Eq. (16),\nif we identify n0 with ns e\u2212\u03c60 . Then we can write Eq. (27) as\nd2 \u03c6\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= \u22124\u03c0lB [n0 (e\u2212\u03c6 \u2212 (ns /n0 )e+\u03c6 ) \u2212 f \u03c6(z)].\n2\ndz\n\n(28)\n\nWhen ns /n0 = e\u03c60 << 1, Eq. (16) is definitely a good approximation to\nthe problem, and we are justified in treating the system as one without\nexcess salt. To determine the conditions under which Eq. (16) is a good\napproximation, we solve Eq. (16), in order to determine n0 as described\nearlier in this section, and determine \u03c60 from n0 = ns e\u2212\u03c60 , and use \u03c60 and\nthe solution of Eq. (16) for \u03c6\u0304(z), which we identify with \u03c6\u2032 (z) (which is the\napproximate solution to Eq. (28)) to determine the conditions under which\nwe may neglect e\u03c6\u0304(z) compared to e\u2212\u03c6\u0304(z) . (Remember that \u03c6\u0304(z) is negative.)\n\u2032\nSince it is easily seen from Eq. (10) that e\u2212\u03c6 (z) is significantly greater than\n1 over much of the range of z from 0 to h for high density polymer brushes,\n19\n\n\fall that is required in order to neglect e\u03c6\u0304(z) is that ns /n0 be of order unity,\nwhich is already satisfied for the 0.1 M salt concentration (or 0.6 \u00d7 1026 m\u22121 )\ntypical of living matter. It is demonstrated in appendix A that these results\nfollow directly from the exact solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation\nwith excess salt present[20].\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIt has been shown using a modified version of the mean field theory of\nMiklavic Marcelja[19] for polyelectrolyte polymer brushes, which uses the\nnon-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, that it should be possible for osmotic pressure due to the counterions to support a reasonably large load\n(about 106 P a) with the tops of the brushes sufficiently far apart to prevent entanglement of polymers belonging to the two brushes, which has been\nargued to account for most of the friction. This load carrying ability is argued to persist in the presence of an amount of added salt comparable to\nthat found in living matter. Significant additional salt, however, provides\nscreening which reduces the load carrying ability of polyelectrolyte brushes.\nUsing counterions of higher valence will also not improve the load carrying\nbecause it will actually reduce the net charge on the polymers, by causing\nmore counterions to condense[30]. This will in turn reduce the counterion\nconcentration in solution. The load carrying ability of the brushes could be\nimproved by using a solvent with a higher dielectric constant, which would\nreduce the value of the Bjerrum length, which appears in the denominator of\nthe expression for the counterion osmotic pressure [Eq. (15)]. Using denser\nbrushes or better solvents, which increase the ratio of brush height to polymer\nradius of gyration would improve the load carrying ability, since the minimum thickness of the interface region between the polymer brushes which\navoids entanglements that lead to static friction, is given approximately by\nthe quantity \u03be under Eq. (8) is proportional to h\u22121/3 . Making this region\nless thick increases the counterion osmotic pressure, as Eq. (15) shows that\nit is inversely proportional to the square of the interface region thickness.\n\n20\n\n\f7\n\nAppendix A: The high and Low Salt Concentration Limits of the Exact Solution of\nthe Poisson-Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe exact solution to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation [i.e., Eq. (20)] given\nin the second article in Ref. [20] for the electrostatic potential in the interface\nregion between two polymer brushes in terms of elliptic functions, which are\nclose to each other but not touching, is\n\u03c6\u0304(z) = 2arcsinh[\n\nsinh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2)\n],\ncn(K z\u0304cosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2), k)\n\n(1A)\n\nwhere z\u0304 = D/2 \u2212 h and K = (8\u03c0lB ni )1/2 , where ni is the salt concentration,\ncn (x, k) is an elliptic function and k, the standard elliptic function parameter\nk [36], is given by k = [cosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2)]\u22121. First, let us consider the limit as\n\u03c6\u0304(D/2) approaches zero. From Eq. (1A) we find that\n\u03c6\u0304(z) \u2248\n\n\u03c6\u0304(D/2)\n= \u03c6\u0304(D/2)cosh[K(D/2 \u2212 z)]\ncn(K z\u0304, 1)\n\n(2A)\n\nsince cn(x, k = 1) = sech(x). This is the solution in the Debye-Huckel\napproximation.\nNow let us consider the limit as |\u03c6\u0304(D/2)| approaches infinity. Since\ncosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2) approaches infinity, k in Eq. (1A) approaches zero. It is easily\nshown that cn(u,k=0)=cos(u). Then, from Eq. (1A) we obtain\nsinh(\u03c6\u0304/2) \u2248\n=\n\nsinh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2)\ncn(Kzcosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2), 0)\n\nsinh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2)\n,\ncos(Kzcosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2))\n\nwhich becomes for |\u03c6\u0304(D/2)| >> 1,\n\u03c6\u0304(z) \u2248 \u03c6\u0304(D/2) + ln|cos2 [(K(z \u2212 D/2)cosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2)]|.\n\n(3A)\n\nSince as |\u03c6\u0304(D/2)| approaches infinity, cosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2) is approximately equal\nto (1/2)e|\u03c6\u0304(D/2)|/2 , Kcosh(\u03c6\u0304(D/2)/2) becomes [2\u03c0lB n0 ]1/2 , with n0 = ns e|\u03c6\u0304(D/2)| =\nns e\u2212\u03c6\u0304(D/2) . The latter result follows from the fact that since the counterions\nmust have lower potential energy between the plates than outside the plates,\n\u03c6\u0304(D/2) < 0.\n21\n\n\f8\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nI wish to thank R.
