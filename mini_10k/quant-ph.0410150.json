Among several proposals of implementing quantum information processing in realistic physical systems, solid state quantum computing is one of the\nmost promising candidates for future quantum computer architecture due to its scalability. Meanwhile, the idea of using spin degree of freedom in electronics[2] has been strongly\nsupported from recent experiments showing unusually long spin decoherence time in semiconductors. The first QC scheme based on electron spin in semiconductor QD was proposed\nby Loss and Divincenzo[3], in which the controlling operations are effected by gating of\nthe tunnelling barrier between neighboring dots, and one-qubit operations by applied magnetic field. Kane designed a silicon based nuclear spin quantum computer[4], information\nis encoded into the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon electronic devices. Local\noperations on individual spins are performed using externally applied electric fields, and\ninteraction between qubits is mediated through the donor-electron exchange interaction. In\nRef. [5], optical RKKY interaction between charged semiconductor QDs is generated via\nvirtual excitation of delocalized excitons, and it provides an efficient coherent control of the\nspins. Very recently, Calarco et al.[6] presented an all optical implementations of QC with\nsemiconductor QDs, where two-qubit gates are realized by switching on trion-trion coulomb\ninteractions between different QDs, state selectivity is achieved via conditional laser excitation exploring Pauli exclusion principle.\nThe idea of most existing QC schemes is to design an effective Hamiltonian and then\nfind or adjust a physical system to evolve approximately under the effective Hamiltonian.\nAny deviation from the \"beautiful\" effective Hamiltonian in practical physics system will\nbring complexity, even disaster, to the practical QC[7]. In this paper, we give a new QC\nscheme based on a more fundamental Hamiltonian in solid state physics. The qubit states\nare selected as the spin states of an excess electron stored in a semiconductor QD. The\nHamiltonian of electrons in semiconductor QDs dressed by an external magnetic field can\nbe described as following\nH =\n\nX\n\n(1)\n\nhi ,\n\ni\n\nhi =\n\n1 2\nP \u2212 g\u03bcB Bi * Si + V (ri ).\n2m\u2217e i\n2\n\n\fwhere single-particle Hamiltonian hi describes the electron dynamics confined to semiconductor QD. m\u2217e is the effective mass of electron in semiconductor QD. We allow for a local\nmagnetic field Bi applied on QD i. V (ri ) is the confinement-potential experienced by the\nelectron in QD.\nAll operations in our scheme are performed on individual QDs. Using single-qubit rotation\nand adjusting gate voltage to drive electron between QDs through one dimensional quantum\nwire, a quantum control gate can be realized naturally. The detailed descriptions on design\nof a CNOT gate are given in Sec. II. Physical implementation and a brief discussion on gate\nfidelity are presented in Sec. III. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nFORMULA FOR QUANTUM GATE\n\nIt is well known that single qubit and CNOT gates together can be used to implement\nan arbitrary unitary operation, and therefore are universal for quantum computation[1]. A\nsingle qubit is a vector |\u03c8i = a|0i + b|1i parameterized by two complex numbers satisfying\n\n|a|2 + |b|2 = 1. Operations on a qubit must preserve this norm, and thus are described by\n2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrices. Any single qubit rotations can be realized by two of the following\n\nthree rotation operators Rx (\u03b8) = e\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3x , Ry (\u03b8) = e\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3y , and Rz (\u03b8) = e\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3z , where \u03c3x , \u03c3y ,\nand \u03c3z are Pauli matrices.\nIn textbook, a CNOT operator is described by a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix,\n\uf8eb\n\n1 0 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0 1 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nCNOT = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec0 0 0 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0 0 1 0\n\n(2)\n\nit can be rewritten as\n1\nCNOT = [I \u2297 \u03c3x \u2212 \u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3x + I \u2297 I + \u03c3z \u2297 I],\n2\n\n(3)\n\u03c0\n\nwhere I is 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix. Further, substituting Eq. (3) into CNOT = \u2212iei 2 CN OT ,\n\n3\n\n\fwe have\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\nCNOT = e\u2212i 2 I\u2297I * ei 4 (I\u2297\u03c3x \u2212\u03c3z \u2297\u03c3x +I\u2297I+\u03c3z \u2297I) ,\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n= e\u2212i 4 I\u2297I * ei 4 I\u2297\u03c3x * ei 4 \u03c3z \u2297I * e\u2212i 4 \u03c3z \u2297\u03c3x ,\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n1\n= e\u2212i 4 I\u2297I * ei 4 I\u2297\u03c3x * ei 4 \u03c3z \u2297I * \u221a (I \u2297 I \u2212 i\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3x ),\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n1\n= e\u2212i 4 I\u2297I * ei 4 I\u2297\u03c3x * ei 4 \u03c3z \u2297I * \u221a [I \u2297 I \u2212 i(\u03c3z \u2297 I) * (I \u2297 \u03c3x )],\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n3\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n1\n= e\u2212i 4 I\u2297I * ei 4 I\u2297\u03c3x * ei 4 \u03c3z \u2297I * \u221a (I \u2297 I + e\u2212i 2 * e\u2212i 2 \u03c3z \u2297I * e\u2212i 2 I\u2297\u03c3x ).\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThe first term at the last line of Eq. (4) can easily be realized by letting two qubits\nevolve freely under each single electron Hamiltonian respectively without any operations.\nThe second and the third terms are only single spin rotations. By the superposition of\nelectron spin state and charge position, the fourth term in Eq. (4) can be implemented\nnaturally, which will be illustrated in Sec. III. So, only six steps(including five operations)\nare required to complement a CNOT quantum gate given by Eq. (4). Compared with the\nCNOT gate presented in ref. [3], there is no need for spin swap operation in our scheme,\nand operations are performed on individual QDs here. Furthermore, four terms on the right\nside of Eq. (4) commute each other, we can exchange the operator sequence arbitrarily.\n\nIII.\n\nPHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe spin states of the excess conductor electron of QD are employed as qubits. Manipulating a single spin can be done by applying a pulsed local magnetic field, two-qubit control\ngate in this paper is realized by a specific spacial distribution of QDs. The architecture of our\ndesigned CNOT gate is shown in Fig. 1, where the gray thick lines stand for one-dimension\nquantum wires, which are used to coherently transport electrons between QDs[9]. Eight\nQDs are needed to implement a CNOT gate. Initial states of two qubits(control qubit and\ntarget qubit) are stored in spin states of the excess electron in QD X1 and X2 respectively,\nand final states of the two qubits are defined as the spin states of electron in QDs Y1 and Y2 .\nQDs w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , Y1 , and Y2 are all empty of electrons in the initial time. Firstly, the\nelectron is being driven from QD X1 to QD w1 and w2 by adjusting gate voltage. The design\nof electric gates can refer to the principle of single electron tunnelling(SET) transistor[8] and\nthe flying qubit in one-dimensional quantum wires[9]. Assuming the two paths and two QDs\n4\n\n\fw1\n\nY1\n\nX1\n\nw4\n\nX2\n\nw2\n\nY2\n\nw3\n\nFIG. 1: Architecture for implementing a CNOT gate. Black spheres stand for quantum dots, and\ngray lines stand for one dimensional quantum wires.\n\n(w1 and w2 )are symmetric, the probabilities of electron in QD w1 and w2 will be equal in\ntheory. By the same method, The electron in QD X2 is also being driven into QD w3 and\nw4 in parallel. Secondly, we apply an external local magnetic field along z direction on QD\n3\u03c0\n\nw1 to do a spin rotation e\u2212i 2 \u03c3z . Thirdly, an external local magnetic field along x direction\n\u03c0\n\non QD w4 is used to complement operator e\u2212i 2 \u03c3x . Fourthly, apply two electric fields on QD\n\u03c0\n\nw1 and QD w4 respectively to create a global phase difference e\u2212i 2 between QDs w1 , w4 and\nQDs w2 , w3 . At last, two electrons are pushed from QDs w1 , w4 to QD Y1 , and from QDs\nw2 and w3 to QD Y2 respectively. Adjusting gate voltage to eliminate the case that two electrons site on QD Y1 or Y2 simultaneously. According to the coulomb blockade effect, there\nare only two possible pathes for the two electrons actually occur. One is X1 \u2192 w2 \u2192 Y2 ;\nX2 \u2192 w4 \u2192 Y1 (Solid arrows in Fig. 1), The other is X1 \u2192 w1 \u2192 Y1 ; X2 \u2192 w3 \u2192 Y2 (Dashed\narrows). In mathematic language, the above process can be described as following,\nO\n3\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n[\u03c1w3 e\u2212i 2 e\u2212i 2 \u03c3x |SX2 i + \u03c1w4 |SX2 i], (5)\n|SX1 i \u2297 |SX2 i = [\u03c1w1 e\u2212i 2 e\u2212i 2 \u03c3z |SX1 i + \u03c1w2 |SX1 i]\nwhere \u03c1w1 and \u03c1w2 are the probabilities of electron in QD w1 and QD w2 respectively, \u03c1w3 and\n\u03c1w4 are the probabilities of electron in QD w3 and QD w4 respectively.

(4) can be complemented by the above architecture\nunder the condition of equal probabilities(\u03c1w1 = \u03c1w2 = \u03c1w3 = \u03c1w4 ). Two single-qubit\noperations (the 2nd and 3rd terms in Eq. (4))can be performed by applied two local pulsed\nmagnetic fields along X and Z directions on QDs X1 and X2 respectively at the initial time.\nThey can also be performed on QDs Y1 and Y2 at the final time. The successful criterium\nof the above control gate is that two electrons must arrive at QDs Y1 and Y2 at the final\ntime. If QDs Y1 and Y2 only process one electron at the final time(50% probability), then\nthe control operation will be discarded. So, a measurement must be done at the final time\nto check whether the control gate has been performed successfully.\nIf a two-qubit control gate has been done successfully, the potential quantum error of our\nscheme comes from the asymmetric probabilities of electron positions, namely, \u03c1w1 6= \u03c1w2 ,\n\u03c1w3 6= \u03c1w4 . We define the fidelity of our CNOT gate induced by the asymmetric probabilities\nof electron positions as\n\u2032\n\nF ={\n\n\u2032\n\n2 \u2212 U \u2020 U , U \u2020 U \u2265 1;\n\u2032\n\nU \u2020U ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\n\nU \u2020 U < 1,\n\nand\n\u03c1w1 \u03c1w3 \u03c1\u2032w1 (x)\u03c1\u2032w3 (x\u2032 ) + \u03c1w2 \u03c1w4 \u03c1\u2032w2 (1 \u2212 x)\u03c1\u2032w4 (1 \u2212 x\u2032 )\n,\n(\u03c1w1 \u03c1w3 )2 + (\u03c1w2 \u03c1w4 )2\n\u03c1\u2032 (x) = x,\n\u2032\n\nU \u2020U =\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwhere operator U is the ideal CNOT operator described by Eq. (6), U \u2032 is the practical\noperator with the consideration of potential asymmetric probabilities of electron positions\n\u2032\n\nin real space. under the case of equal probabilities (symmetric case), we have \u03c1wi = \u03c1wi = 0.5,\nand the fidelity is equal to 1 by the definition of Eq. (7). we use x(0 \u2264 x \u2264 1)to measure\nthe magnitude of asymmetry of electron positions, and the symmetric case corresponds to\nx = 0.5. Fidelity of the CNOT gate as a function of the asymmetry in case x = x\u2032 is plotted\nin Fig. 2. It is shown, in Fig. 2, that fidelity will be up 99% when the asymmetry does not\nexceed 10%.\nUnder the precondition of high fidelity, a small size difference between QD w1 and w2 (\nand between QD w3 and w4 ) is permitted. Reminding that QDs w1 and w4 does not need\nthe same in size. As a result, the single-qubit operations can be performed selectively with\ndifferent frequencies, and the local pulsed magnetic field may also be replaced by optical\n6\n\n\f1.00\n\nF\n\n0.99\n\n0.98\n\n0.97\n0.45\n\n0.50\n\n0.55\n\nx=x'\n\nFIG. 2: The fidelity of the CNOT gate as a function of the asymmetry of electron positions\n\noperations, and the single qubit rotations can be proceeded by applying two laser fields\nwhich exactly satisfy the Raman-resonance condition between spin-up state and spin-down\nstate[10][11]. Optical operation will sufficiently reduce single-qubit operation time.\n\nOperation time and decoherence time are critical criteria on the feasibility of a QC\nscheme[1]. For a single spin flip rotation, a switching time of \u03c4s = 30ps is required, using a magnetic field of B = 1T [12]. Considering the switching on/off time of electric field is\nabout 20 \u223c 30ps, gate voltage must be adjusted carefully to create a small potential difference between QDs w1 , w4 , and QDs w2 , w3 [13]. If two pulsed lasers are used to complement a\nsingle qubit operation, the single spin flip operation time is about ten picoseconds for a given\ncoupling constant between Laser and QD \u03a9 = 1meV . Decoherence time of spin states in\nsemiconductor QD has also been extensively studied in theory and experiment[14][15], and\ncoherent transport of spin charge in semiconductor has been discussed in detail. [2][9][12].\nState initialization and read-out can be implemented using spin filters and polarizers in any\ndesigns[12][16]. Our motivation is to show a new theoretical design direction on quantum\ncontrol gate based on semiconductor QDs. So, we do not focus more attentions on challenges\ncommon to all other implementations in electron spins and QDs system. The great challenge to our scheme, which is different from other schemes in practical, is how to manipulate\nsingle electron transport coherently between QDs through one-dimensional quantum wire or\nnanotube, this difficulty can be solved by the rapid development of single electron tunnelling\ntransistor technologies.\n\n7\n\n\fIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn summary, we have presented a new QC scheme based on semiconductor QDs system.\nThe superposition of spin state and charge position in real space and coulomb blockade effect\nare introduced to design a CNOT gate. All the quantum states' evolutions in our scheme\nbase on a more fundamental Hamiltonian. No direct spin-spin coupling is needed here. Our\nscheme, which is based on solid state QD, is essentially different from the mobile qubit\nscheme[9], and spin state operations are more stable in general. As we know, it is the first\ntime that a control gate is designed by the superposition of electron spin state and charge\nposition in quantum computation based on QDs system. Our scheme is simple except for a\ndedicated circuit and more QDs needed. Furthermore, our scheme can safely be extended\ninto the charge qubit case by replacing each QD with a coupled QDs, and qubit states are\ndefined as the excess electron charge states in coupled QDs.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by the National Science Council of ROC under Contract No. NSC-93-2120-M-006-005, No. NSC-93-2112-M-006-011, No. NSC-93-2112-M-006019 and National Center for Theoretical Science(South), Taiwan.\n\n8\n\n\f[1] M.
