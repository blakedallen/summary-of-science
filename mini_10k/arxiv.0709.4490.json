Over the years they have attracted attention of\nChemists, Physicists, and Biologists. These complex systems have also found many industrial applications ranging from water treatment to superabsorbants. Besides the charged\npolymers (polyions), a polyelectrolyte solution can contain salt and other molecules which\nmay strongly interact with the polyions resulting in a plethora of interesting behavior. The\ncomplexity of polyelectrolyte solutions and the long range of the Coulomb interaction makes\nstudy of these systems particularly challenging\n\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22\n\n.\n\nIn this work we will explore polyelectrolyte solutions containing salt and ionic surfactants.\nThese systems have attracted particular attention because the polyelectrolyte-surfactant, or\nmore realistically, polyelectrolyte-lipid adsorption can be used to neutralize the DNA charge,\nfacilitating the transfection of the DNA across a phospholipid cell membrane. Since the\npolyions which are of particular interest to us, such as the DNA, are quite rigid (persistence\nlength 50nm) one can model them as rigid cylinders with the monomeric charge uniformly\ndistributed along the main axis. This provides a significant simplification, since for such\nrigid molecules the internal degrees of freedom can be ignored.\nAssociation between the cationic surfactants and the anionic polyions is driven by the\nelectrostatic and the hydrophobic interactions. The hydrophobicity of the surfactant tails\nis responsible for the cooperative nature of the surfactant adsorption23,24,31 . When the concentration of surfactant inside the solution is low, most of the molecules remain free, unassociated. As the concentration of surfactant is increased, a density is reached at which the\nnumber of adsorbed surfactants rises sharply. We will denote this as the critical adsorption concentration (CAC). The goal of the theory is to predict the value of the CAC as a\nfunction of the polyelectrolyte and the salt concentrations for different kinds of polyion and\nsurfactant molecules.\nAll the information about the thermodynamics of the system is contained in its free\nenergy. The Helmholtz free energy for the polyelectrolyte-surfactant solution can be constructed based on the fundamental ideas of Debye, H\u00fcckel and Bjerrum25,26,27,28 . The resulting Debye-H\u00fcckel-Bjerrum theory corrects for the linearization of the Boltzmann factor\nby explicitly introducing into the theory the non-linear configurations in the form of clusters composed of associated anionic and cationic entities. The concentration of clusters is\n2\n\n\fCOMPLEX\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nFREE COUNTERIONS\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFREE SURFACTANT\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\nSALT\n\nap\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n_\nZ=L\nb\na = ac+ ap\n\nL\n\n}\n\nb\nac\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n}z\n\na\n\nFIG. 1: The model.\n\ndetermined by the law of mass action. It can be shown that in the infinite dilution limit\nthis theory yields the exact Manning limiting laws for rigid polyelectrolyte solutions30 .\nTo model the hydrophobic interaction of surfactant tails, we will introduce a hydrophobicity parameter \u03c7. The basic theory has been presented elsewhere24,31 , and in this paper\nwe will review it only briefly, referring the interested reader to the original publications. The\ngoal of the present work is to compare the predictions of the theory with the experimental\ndata on the association of undecyl-, dodecyl, tridecyl-, and tetradeculpyridinium cations\nwith the anionic polyelectrolyte sodium dextran sulfate in an aqueous solutions33 . We will\nalso derive a simple asymptotic law for the behavior of the CAC at high salt concentrations,\nwhich we expect to be valid for all rigid polyelectrolyte-surfactant systems. Although dextran sulfate is not nearly as rigid as the DNA for which the original theory was developed,\nnevertheless, if we restrict ourselves to sufficiently large salt concentration for which the\nDebye length is shorter than the polyelectrolyte persistence length, the polyion flexibility\ncan be neglected. We should also note that the present theory is only valid for sufficiently\ndilute polyelectrolyte solutions prior to a phase separation which can occur following addition of cationic surfactants. The high density phases will have to be described by a different\ntheory35 .\nIn the next section we will briefly review the thermodynamic model used to perform the\ncalculations.\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE THEORY\n\nThe polyelectrolyte solution, illustrated in Fig. 1, consists of Np cylindrical anionic\npolyions of length L and diameter ap , Na monovalent amphiphiles, and Ns \"molecules\" of\nsalt. In an aqueous solution, the anionic polyions are ionized resulting in Z monomers,\neach of charge \u2212q, distributed uniformly with separation b = L/Z along the main axis.\nAs a result of ionization, Z monovalent counterions are liberated into the solution for each\npolyion. We will suppose that salt is a strong electrolyte which is fully dissociated in an\naqueous environment resulting in an equal number of positively and negatively charged\nmonovalent ions. Similarly, we will assume that the head group of each surfactant molecule\nis fully dissociated, producing a negative monovalent coion (charge \u2212q) and a polymeric\nchain with a cationic head group of charge +q. For simplicity, all the counterions and coions\nwill be treated as identical, independent of the molecules from which they were derived. The\nions will be idealized as hard spheres of diameter ac and charge \u00b1q located at the center.\nThe surfactant molecules will be modeled as polymers of za spherical monomers (each of\na diameter ac ) with the head monomer carrying a charge +q. The solvent, water, will be\ntreated as a continuum of dielectric constant D. The hydrophobic interaction between the\nsurfactant tails is short ranged and will be characterized by a parameter \u03c7.\nInside the polyelectrolyte solution, the concentration of polyions is \u03c1p = Np /V , the concentration of monovalent salt is Cs = Ns /V , and the concentration of monovalent amphiphile\n(surfactants) is Ca = Na /V . The strong electrostatic interactions between the polyions the\nmicroions and the cationic surfactants leads to formation of complexes which - in thermodynamic equilibrium - will be made of one polyion, nc associated monovalent counterions,\nand na associated amphiphiles. Particle conservation requires that\n\u03c1c = (Z \u2212 nc ) \u03c1p + Cs ,\n\u03c1a = Ca \u2212 na \u03c1p ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1c is the concentration of free monovalent counterions and \u03c1a is the concentration\nof free amphiphiles. The concentration of coion \u03c1\u2212 inside the solution is unaffected by the\nassociation,\n\u03c1\u2212 = Cs + Ca ,\n\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe total concentration of free monovalent charges is then\n\u03c1f = \u03c1c + \u03c1a + \u03c1\u2212 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe goal of the theory is to determine the number of condensed counterions nc and the\ncondensed surfactants na . In order to achieve this, the Helmholtz free energy of the polyelectrolyte solution is constructed and minimized. The details of the calculation can be\nfound elsewhere24,31 here we just give the few main steps.\nThe largest contributions to the Helmholtz free energy of a dilute polyelectrolyte solution\nare electrostatic and entropic,\nF = Fel + Fent .\n\n(4)\n\nThe electrostatic free energy density fel = Fel /V is the result of the interaction between the\ncomplexes and the free charges inside the solution. It can be obtained using the framework\nof the Debye-H\u00fcckel-Bjerrum (DHBj) theory1,29 and has been calculated in our previous\nwork to be24,31 :\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c1p Zc2 (a/L)\n(\u03ba a)2\n\u03b2f =\u2212\n,\n2 ln [\u03ba a K1 (\u03ba a)] \u2212 I0 (\u03baa) +\nT \u2217 (\u03baa)2\n2\nel\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T , f = F/Np and\nI0 (\u03baa) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03baa\n\n0\n\nx K02 (x)\ndx .\nK12 (x)\n\n(6)\n\nHere Kn (x) is the modified Bessel function of order n, \u03ba in (\u03ba a)2 = 4 \u03c0 \u03c1\u2217f /T \u2217 is the inverse\nof the Debye screening length, \u03c1\u2217f = \u03c1f a3 is the reduced density, and T \u2217 = D kB T a/q 2\nis the reduced temperature. We have defined a = (ac + ap )/2 as the effective radius and\nZc = Z \u2212 na \u2212 nc as the effective charge of the polyion-amphiphile complex.

For structureless particles, the internal partition function is \u03b6\u2212 = \u03b6c = 1. For\nsurfactants, the Flory theory gives \u03b6a+ = za .

The internal\npartition function of a complex \u03b6p can be calculated by modeling the polyion as a one dimensional lattice of Z adsorption sites. The number of associated counterions/surfactants\nat each site can be either zero or one. The problem of calculating the internal partition\nfunction of the polyion-amphiphile complex then reduces to finding the free energy of a one\ndimensional lattice gas of three different states: empty, associated with a counterion, and\nassociated with a surfactant. This free energy can be calculated approximately31 to be\n\n\u0015\nZc 2\n\u2212 ln \u03b6p [mc , ma ] = \u03be K\n\u2212 1 + \u03b2 \u03c7 (Z \u2212 1) m2a\nZ2\n+ Z mc ln mc + Z ma ln ma\n\u0014\n\n+ Z (1 \u2212 mc \u2212 ma ) ln (1 \u2212 mc \u2212 ma ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03be \u2261 \u03b2 q 2 /D a is the Manning parameter, K = Z [\u03c8 (Z) \u2212 \u03c8 (1)] \u2212 Z + 1, and \u03c8 (n) is\nthe digamma function. The first term of Eq. (9) accounts for the electrostatic interaction\nbetween the polyion and the condensed counterions and surfactants, the second term is due\nto the gain in the hydrophobic free energy when two surfactant tails are in a vicinity of each\nother, the other terms are entropic \u2013 resulting from the thermal diffusion of the condensed\nparticles along the polyion chain. The characteristic energy of the interaction between the\ncondensed surfactants is measured by a phenomenological parameter \u03c7. For each type of\nsurfactant molecule, the value of \u03c7 will be determined by the best fit to the experimental\ndata.\nThe equilibrium configuration of the system is found by minimizing the total Helmholtz\n6\n\n\fza\n\n\u03c7\n\n12 \u22125.5\n13 \u22126.8\n14 \u22127.9\n15 \u22129.3\nTABLE I: Relation between the fitted \u03c7 and za .\n\nfree energy with respect to the number of associated counterions and surfactants,\n\u2202F\n= 0,\n\u2202 mc\n\u2202F\n= 0.\n\u2202 ma\n\n(10)\n\nSolving this system of equations, the number of condensed counterions and surfactants can\nbe determined as a function of the concentration of polyelectrolyte, salt, and surfactant.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe will define a surfoplex as a complex in which almost all the polyion monomers are\nneutralized by the cationic amphiphiles. Surfoplexes are formed when the concentration of\nthe amphiphile inside the solution reaches the CAC, Cac . For practical applications in gene\ntherapy, the CAC is of particular importance since it gives the minimum amount of surfactant\nneeded to neutralize the DNA charge for the transfection across the cell membrane36 . Since\nthe cationic surfactants and lipids are quite toxic, in vivo applications require that the\namount of amphiphile used in a transfection be as low as possible36 .\nThe CAC depends on the amount of salt inside the solution and on the specifics of\nthe polyelectrolyte and the surfactant to be used. To calculate it, we first obtain the full\nadsorption isotherm, from which the surfoplex formation and the CAC are identified as the\npoint of the cooperative binding transition characterized by a sharp rise in the adsorbed\nfraction of the amphiphile. We note that in general this can be either a first or a second\norder phase transition, or simply a sharp crossover.\n\n7\n\n\f\u22123.5\n\n12\n13\n\nc\n\nlog \u03c1a (M)\n\n\u22124\n\n14\n\u22124.5\n\n15\n\u22125\n\n\u22125.5\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nCs(M)\n\nFIG. 2: Density of free surfactant at the transition as a function of salt concentration, log10 \u03c1ca (M )\u00d7\nCs (M ) for za = 12, 13, 14, 15.

Theoretically24 , we expect \u03c7 to be a linear function of za . The experiments\nwere performed at 30oC. The diameter of sodium dextran sulfate is ap = 7 \u00c5 and the\ndistance between the consecutive charged monomers is b = 2.5 \u00c5 (\u03be \u2248 2.8). The binding\nisotherms obtained experimentally show the formation of surfoplexes when the surfactant\nconcentration reaches the CAC, Cac (za , Cs , Z, \u03c1p ), which is strongly dependent on the concentration of all the species and on the type of surfactant used. The CAC was found to\nincrease with the salt concentration. The experimental data also showed that the CAC decreased rapidly with the length of the surfactant hydrophobic tail, see Figure 2. To compare\nwith the experiment, the theoretical binding isotherms were computed by the procedure described in the previous section. The number density of polyelectrolyte monomers was taken\n\n8\n\n\f\u22125\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22127\n\n\u03c7\n\u22128\n\n\u22129\n\n\u221210\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nza\n\nFIG. 3: The hydrophobicity parameter \u03c7 versus za obtained by fitting the experimental data of\nMalovikova et al.33 . The dashed line is the linear fit.\n\nto be the same as in the reference33 . The diameter of the polyion counterions, of salt ions,\nand of the surfactant monomers were all taken to be ac = 9 \u00c5. This was done in order to\nsimplify the calculations and to minimize the number of adjustable parameters. The final\nresults were only weakly dependent on the precise value of ac . Each polyion was (arbitrarily)\ntaken to have Z = 3 000 charged monomers (experiments do not provide the length of the\npolyions, but only the number density of the polyion monomers Z\u03c1p ). The hydrophobicity\nparameter \u03c7 was obtained by performing a fit of the theoretically calculated CACs to the\nexperimental data. For each amphiphile type, a unique value of \u03c7 was used to obtain the\ndependence of the CAC on the concentration of salt. Figure 2 shows that the theory agrees\nquite well with the experimental data of Malovikova et al. for all 4 surfactants. Table 1\nprovides the best fit value of the hydrophobicity parameter \u03c7, and Figure 3 shows that \u03c7 is,\nindeed, a linear function of the surfactant length, as was expected theoretically24 .

We see that that, as expected, the CAC\ndoes not depend individually on Z and \u03c1p , but only on the product of the two - the total\nnumber density of the polyion monomers \u03c1m . Furthermore, from Figures 4 and 5 we see\nthat the CAC becomes a linear function of Cs for sufficiently large salt concentrations and\nsufficiently low monomer density,\nCac = b0 (za , Z\u03c1p ) + b1 (za , Z\u03c1p ) Cs .\n\n(12)\n\nThe amount of salt needed to reach the linear regime depends on the type of surfactant\nused - more salt is needed for surfactants with longer hydrocarbon tails. We now explore\nthe dependence of the CAC on the concentration of polyion monomers \u03c1m inside the linear\nregime. Figure 5 show that while the absolute values of the CAC in the linear regime depend on \u03c1m , the slope is insensitive to the precise concentration of the polyion monomers.\nThis implies that b1 (za , Z\u03c1p ) is independent of Z\u03c1p so that for a given polyelectrolyte solution b1 (za , Z\u03c1p ) = a1 (za ). Furthermore, we note that the CAC lines for uniformly spaced\nmonomer concentrations are equidistant, see Figure 5. This implies that the coefficient\nb0 (za , Z\u03c1p ) must be a linear function of Z\u03c1p , so that b0 (za , Z\u03c1p ) = c(za ) + a0 (za )Z\u03c1p .

The theory is based on the fundamental\nideas of Debye, H\u00fcckel and Bjerrum1 . The only free parameter is the magnitude of the\n12\n\n\fhydrophobic interaction between the condensed surfactants \u03c7. In agreement with the theoretical expectations, this parameter is found to be a linear function of the surfactant length\nza . For high salt concentrations and sufficiently low monomer densities, we find that the\nCAC is a bilinear function of the monomer Z\u03c1p and salt Cs concentrations, with the coefficients dependent only on the length of surfactants used. For the specific case of the\nassociation of the undecyl-, dodecyl, tridecyl-, and tetradeculpyridinium surfactants with\nthe anionic polyelectrolyte sodium dextran sulfate, the coefficients of the bilinear form are\ncalculated explicitly and presented in eqs. (13) and (14).\nWe note that the present theory does not take into account the non-electrostatic specific\ninteractions between the polyions and surfactants. In view of a good agreement between\nthe theory and the experiment, however, we conclude that such interactions are not very\nsignificant, at least for the present polyelectrolyte surfactant system. It would be of great\ninterest to test the the predictions of the theory, in particular the bilinear dependence of\nthe CAC on the salt and the monomer concentrations, on other polyelectrolyte-surfactant\nsystems.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: levin@if.ufrgs.br\n\n1\n\nLevin, Y.
