Because it is assumed that radiation delay is caused by\nthe finite speed of light, the following difficulty arises when the numerical method is used: the region of variation of\nthe variables (dimensionless coordinate \u03c4 and time t) is triangular (the inequality \u03c4 \u2264 t). This difficulty is overcome\nby expanding the unknown functions in series in terms of small values of the time and coordinate. By comparing the\nnumerical and exact solutions for a point source with a given time dependence for its power and with pure scattering,\nthe steps in the variables required to obtain a desired accuracy are estimated. This numerical method can be used to\ncalculate the intensity and polarization of the radiation from sources in the early universe during epochs close to the\nrecombination epoch.\nKeywords: radiation scattering: time dependent\n1. Introduction. Analytical and numerical solutions are given in this paper for a simple problem of time dependent,\nmonochromatic scattering of radiation in a so-called one dimensional medium.\nAn idealized medium is refered to as one dimensional if a photon, either preserves the direction of its motion upon\nscattering in this medium, or its direction of motion reverses (backward-forward scattering), so that it propagates\nalong a straight line. The assumption of a one dimensional medium is equivalent to assuming that the scattering takes\nplace with an indicatrix equal to the sum of spike (delta-function) indicatrices. This kind of scattering problems was\nexamined in the early development of radiative transport theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The description of scattering in an\nordinary (three dimensional) medium reduces approximately to the transport equations for a one dimensional medium\n[1].\nHere we examine the propagation of radiation in a one dimensional medium with invariant optical properties. It\nis assumed that the scattering is isotropic, monochromatic and, as usually assumed for monochromatic scattering,\nsuch that the time delay of the photons is caused by the time they spend in transit, while scattering events are\ninstantaneous. The sources of primary radiation can be nonisotropic, with an arbitrary spatial distribution, and have\nan arbitrary time dependence.\nSince the medium is stationary, we can introduce the optical path \u03c4 , measured from some point in units of the\nmean free path of the photons. We restrict ourselves to scattering in an infinite medium, where the optical path \u03c4\nranges from \u2212\u221e to \u221e. The time t is also measured in units of the mean time between collisions. Sources can act from\ntime t = \u2212\u221e, when there is no radiation field. The solution of this problem is obtained here in an explicit analytical\nform.\nThe main object of attention is a point source with a given time dependence of its radiated power. The existence of\nan exact solution has made it possible to choose a numerical method for solving equations similar to those for scattering\nin a one dimensional medium. It is planned to use this numerical method in a separate article for calculating the\nevolution of the intensity and polarization of radiation from sources in epochs of the early universe close to the\nrecombination epoch (see [7] and [8], for example).\n2. Basic equations. We denote the intensity of the radiation propagating in the direction of increasing and\ndecreasing optical depths by I+ (t, \u03c4 ) and I\u2212 (t, \u03c4 ), respectively. Then the two equations for the evolution of the\nradiation field can be written in the form\n\u2032\nI \u0307\u00b1 (t, \u03c4 ) \u00b1 I\u00b1\n(t, \u03c4 ) = \u2212I\u00b1 (t, \u03c4 ) + B\u00b1 (t, \u03c4 ).\n1 e-mail:\n2 e-mail:\n\ndinagirner@gmail.com\nskirusheva@mail.ru\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fHere a time derivative is indicated by an overhead dot and a derivative with respect to the optical path length, by a\nprime. The two source functions, as always, consist of two parts, one characterizing the power of the primary source\nand the other describing the scattering:\nB\u00b1 (t, \u03c4 ) = g\u00b1 (t, \u03c4 ) + \u03bbJc (t, \u03c4 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the probability of survival of a photon in each scattering event. Here we have introduced the average\nintensity Jc (t, \u03c4 ). We can immediately introduce the radiative flux, as well:\nJc (t, \u03c4 ) =\n\nI+ (t, \u03c4 ) + I\u2212 (t, \u03c4 )\n,\n2\n\nHc (t, \u03c4 ) =\n\nI+ (t, \u03c4 ) \u2212 I\u2212 (t, \u03c4 )\n.\n2\n\n(3)\n\nAdding and subtracting Eqs. (1) yield equation for the average intensity and the flux:\nJ\u0307c (t, \u03c4 ) + Hc\u2032 (t, \u03c4, t) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)Jc (\u03c4, t) = fJ (\u03c4, t),\nwhere\nfJ (t, \u03c4 ) =\n\ng+ (t, \u03c4 ) + g\u2212 (t, \u03c4 )\n,\n2\n\n\u1e22c (t, \u03c4 ) + Jc\u2032 (t, \u03c4 ) + Hc (t, \u03c4 ) = fH (t, \u03c4 ),\n\nfH (t, \u03c4 ) =\n\ng+ (t, \u03c4 ) \u2212 g\u2212 (t, \u03c4 )\n.\n2\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\n3. Laplace transform. An efficient way of solving time dependent problems is to use Laplace transforms with\nrespect to time. We shall indicate the transform with a tilde over the transformed function:\nJ \u0303(\u03c4, s) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nJc (t, \u03c4 )e\n\n\u2212st\n\ndt,\n\nH\u0303(\u03c4, s) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHc (t, \u03c4 )e\u2212st dt.\n\n(6)\n\nApplying the transform to Eqs. (4) for zero initial conditions (at t = \u2212\u221e) yields\nH\u0303\u2032 (\u03c4, s) = \u2212(s + 1 \u2212 \u03bb)J \u0303(\u03c4, s) + f \u0303J (\u03c4, s),\n\nJ \u0303\u2032 (\u03c4, s) = \u2212(s + 1)H\u0303(\u03c4, s) + f \u0303H (\u03c4, s).\n\n(7)\n\nLet us find a solution to Eqs. (7) assuming that the transform parameter s is real and non-negative. Finding\nthe general solution of the homogeneous equation and a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equations, while\nnoting that the solutions must be finite at \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, we obtain\n1\nJ \u0303(\u03c4, s) =\n2\nH\u0303(\u03c4, s) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\nZ\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\ne\u2212k|\u03c4 \u2212\u03c41 |\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ns+1  \u0303\nfJ (\u03c41 , s) + f \u0303H (\u03c41 , s) sgn(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ) d\u03c41 ,\nk\n\n(8)\n\n\u0015\nk  \u0303\nfH (\u03c41 , s) d\u03c41 .\ns+1\n\n(9)\n\n\u0014\ne\u2212k|\u03c4 \u2212\u03c41 | f \u0303J (\u03c41 , s) sgn(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ) +\n\np\nHere the positive root k = (s + 1)(s + 1 \u2212 \u03bb).\n\n4. Inversion of the transforms. In order to invert the Laplace transforms, we use Eqs. 4.17 (5)-(9) of the Bateman\nand Erdelyi handbook [9]. Excluding the singular solutions which arise on inverting the parts of the transforms which\nbehave as e\u2212(s+1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 \u2212\u03c41 | , we write the result of the inversion in the form\n1\nJc (t, \u03c4 ) =\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03bb\n4\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03c41\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n+\n\n\u03bb\n4\n\ndt1 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb)(t\u2212t1 ) [GJJ (\u03bb(t \u2212 t1 ), \u03bb(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ))fJ (t1 , \u03c41 ) + GJH (\u03bb(t \u2212 t1 ), \u03bb(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ))fH (t1 , \u03c41 )] ,(10)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c41\n\nd\u03c41 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 \u2212\u03c41 | [fJ (t \u2212 |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 |, \u03c41 ) + fH (t \u2212 |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 |, \u03c41 ) sgn(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 )] +\n\nt\u2212|\u03c4\nZ \u2212\u03c41 |\n\n1\nHc (t, \u03c4 ) =\n2\nZ\u221e\n\nZ\u221e\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c41 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 \u2212\u03c41 | [fJ (t \u2212 |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 |, \u03c41 ) sgn(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ) + fH (t \u2212 |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 |, \u03c41 )] +\n\nt\u2212|\u03c4\nZ \u2212\u03c41 |\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt1 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb)(t\u2212t1 ) [GHJ (\u03bb(t \u2212 t1 ), \u03bb(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ))fJ (t1 , \u03c41 ) + GHH (\u03bb(t \u2212 t1 ), \u03bb(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41 ))fH (t1 , \u03c41 )] .(11)\n2\n\n\fThis solution is expressed in terms of the Green functions\n\u0014\n\u0010 w \u0011\u0015\n\u0010w \u0011\n\u2212t/2 t\nGJJ (t, \u03c4 ) = e\n+ I0\n,\nI1\nw\n2\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0010w \u0011\nt \u0010w \u0011\n\u2212 I0\n,\nI1\nGHH (t, \u03c4 ) = e\u2212t/2\nw\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c4\nw\nGJH (t, \u03c4 ) = GHJ (\u03c4, t) = e\u2212t/2 I1\n.\nw\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\u221a\nIn these formulas In (z) is the Bessel function of imaginary argument and w = t2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 .

Let us consider the important special case of a time dependent, isotropic source acting at t \u2265 0.\nThe following functions apply in this case:\nfJ (t, \u03c4 ) = \u03b4(\u03c4 )L(t),\n\nfH (t, \u03c4 ) = 0,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the function L(t) characterizes the variation of the source power with time. We shall assume that it is continuous\nand falls off rapidly enough so that the effective duration ts of the source is finite. The corresponding average intensity\nand flux are single integrals. For t \u2265 |\u03c4 |,\n1 \u2212(1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 |\ne\nL(t \u2212 |\u03c4 |) + Ji (t, \u03c4 ),\n2\n\n(18)\n\n1 \u2212(1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 |\ne\nL(t \u2212 |\u03c4 |) sgn(\u03c4 ) + Hi (t, \u03c4 ),\n2\n\n(19)\n\nJc (t, \u03c4 ) =\nHc (t, \u03c4 ) =\nwhere the integral terms are given by\n\u03bb\nJi (t, \u03c4 ) =\n4\n\nt\u2212|\u03c4\nZ |\n\ndt1 e\n\n0\n\n\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb)(t\u2212t1 )\n\n\u03bb\nGJJ (\u03bb(t \u2212 t1 ), \u03bb\u03c4 )L(t1 ), Hi (t, \u03c4 ) =\n4\n\nt\u2212|\u03c4\nZ |\n0\n\ndt1 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb)(t\u2212t1 ) GHJ (\u03bb(t \u2212 t1 ), \u03bb\u03c4 )L(t1 ).\n\n(20)\nThe average intensity is continuous for all \u03c4 and t \u2265 |\u03c4 |. For \u03c4 = 0 and L(t) > 0, i.e., at the site of the point source\nand during the time it acts, the flux has a discontinuity: H(+0, t) \u2212 H(\u22120, t) = L(t). At the points \u03c4 = \u00b1t, where the\nmedium only begins to radiate, the solutions have the following limiting values:\nJ (|\u03c4 |, \u03c4 ) =\n\n1 \u2212(1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 |\ne\nL(0),\n2\n\nH(|\u03c4 |, \u03c4 ) = J (|\u03c4 |, \u03c4 ) sgn(\u03c4 ).\n\n(21)\n\nIt is easy to determine how the solutions behave at late times compared to the time the source is active and at\nlarge distances from it, i.e., for t \u226b ts and t \u226b \u03c4 . We shall assume that the ratios ts /t and \u03c4 /t are small, while the\nratio t0 = \u03c4 2 /t is of the order of unity (i.e., t0 /t is small).

The flux falls off with time substantially more rapidly than\nthe average intensity.\n6. Direct and scattered radiation. The solutions of Eq. (4) for \u03bb = 0 represent the radiation propagating directly\nfrom the source, without undergoing any scattering. For a point source, these solutions are\nJ\u2217 (t, \u03c4 ) =\n\n1 \u2212|\u03c4 |\ne\nL(t \u2212 |\u03c4 |),\n2\n\nH\u2217 (t, \u03c4 ) = J\u2217 (t, \u03c4 ) sgn(\u03c4 ).\n\n(25)\n\nThe scattered (diffuse) radiation is characterized by quantities that go to zero for \u03bb = 0 and are equal to the differences\nof the corresponding functions (18)\u2013(19) and (25), i.e.,\nJd (t, \u03c4 ) = Js (t, \u03c4 ) + Ji (t, \u03c4 ),\n\nHd (t, \u03c4 ) = Js (t, \u03c4 ) sgn(\u03c4 ) + Hi (\u03c4, t),\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the expression outside the integrals is\nJs (t, \u03c4 ) = A(\u03c4 )L(t \u2212 |\u03c4 |),\n\nA(\u03c4 ) =\n\nThe functions Jd (t, \u03c4 ) and Hd (t, \u03c4 ) obey the equations\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u2212(1\u2212\u03bb/2)|\u03c4 |\ne\n\u2212 e\u2212|\u03c4 | .\n2\n\nJ \u0307d (t, \u03c4 ) + Hd\u2032 (t, \u03c4 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)Jd (t, \u03c4 ) = J\u2217 (t, \u03c4 ),\n\n\u1e22d (t, \u03c4 ) + Jd\u2032 (t, \u03c4 ) + Hd (t, \u03c4 ) = 0.\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nThe boundary conditions for these functions are analogous to Eq. (21), but instead a single exponent it is necessary\nto take the difference, i.e., to replace the factor in L(0) by the function A(\u03c4 ). At the site of the source (for \u03c4 = 0) the\naverage intensity and flux of the scattered radiation are continuous, with\nJs (t, 0) = Hd (t, 0) = 0.\n\n(29)\n\nThe asymptotes of the functions Jd (t, \u03c4 ) and Hd (t, \u03c4 ) coincide with the asymptotes of the functions Ji (t, \u03c4 ) and\nHi (t, \u03c4 ), since the expressions outside the integral fall off more rapidly than the integrals.\nBecause of the obvious symmetry of the average intensity and the asymmetry of the flux with respect to \u03c4 , in the\nfollowing we consider \u03c4 \u2265 0, i.e., we consider the radiation field from one side of the source.\n7. Power-law sources. We now consider a rather general kind of source whose power can be expanded in a power\nseries in time near the onset of their activity:\nL(t) = t\u03bc L(t),\n\nL(t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nL l tl ,\n\n(30)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere \u03bc \u2265 0, while L0 6= 0. For source of this type it is appropriate to introduce the new unknown functions (with \u03bc\nand \u03bb as parameters)\nJd (t, \u03c4 ) = y \u03bc J(t, \u03c4 ), Hd (t, \u03c4 ) = y \u03bc H(t, \u03c4 ), y = t \u2212 \u03c4.\n(31)\nThese functions, again, obey the equations\n\u03bc\n1\nJ \u0307 + H \u2032 + (J \u2212 H) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)J = e\u2212\u03c4 L(y),\ny\n2\n4\n\n\u1e22 + J \u2032 +\n\n\u03bc\n(H \u2212 J) + H = 0.\ny\n\n(32)\n\n\fThe boundary conditions for these functions are derived from Eq. (21):\nJ(\u03c4, \u03c4 ) = H(\u03c4, \u03c4 ) = A(\u03c4 )L0 .\n\n(33)\n\nThe integral terms near the boundary t = \u03c4 for power-law sources behave as (y \u226a 1)\n\"\n!#\n(1)\nL0 GJJ (\u03c4 )\ny\ny L0 GJJ (\u03c4, \u03c4 )\nGJJ (\u03c4, \u03c4 )L1 +\n,\n+\nJi (\u03c4 + y, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n4\n\u03bc+1\n\u03bc+2\n\u03bc+1\n\"\n!#\n(1)\ny L0 GHJ (\u03c4, \u03c4 )\nL0 GHJ (\u03c4 )\ny\nHi (\u03c4 + y, \u03c4 ) \u223c\nGHJ (\u03c4, \u03c4 )L1 +\n.\n+\n4\n\u03bc+1\n\u03bc+2\n\u03bc+1\nHere the values of the Green functions at the boundary are given by Eq.

Expansions for small t and \u03c4 . The distinctive feature of the problem is that the region of variation of its\nparameters has the shape of an infinite triangle with boundaries in the (t, \u03c4 ) plane formed by the rays \u03c4 = 0 and \u03c4 = t\nemerging from the coordinate origin. Near the vertex of this triangle it is extremely difficult to discretize the variables,\nso that it is impossible (or very difficult) to use a numerical method from the time of the very onset of the source,\nt = 0. Thus, it makes sense to move slightly away from the vertex point to some other time. Near this point the\nvariables have small values and, if the function L(t) has several derivatives at t = 0, then all the functions, including\nthe unknown functions, can be expanded in Taylor series in the neighborhood of this vertex. If L(t) is analytic, then\nexpansions in power series are possible. Note that our functions are not analytic with respect to the argument \u03c4 , since\nthey depend on |\u03c4 |. Thus, the power law expansion, we shall obtain for \u03c4 \u2265 0, cannot be extended to negative \u03c4 .\nIt is easy to see that for a power law source whose power is given by Eqs. (30), because the equations are linear, it\nis possible to resolve components of the radiation field belonging to different powers in the expansion of the function\nL and proportional to the coefficients Ll , i.e., one can write the average intensity and flux in the form\nJ(t, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nl\n\ny Ll Jl (\u03c4, y),\n\nH(t, \u03c4 ) =\n\nl=0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ny l Ll Hl (\u03c4, y),\n\n(37)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere y = t \u2212 \u03c4 .\nSubstituting Eqs. (37) in Eqs. (32), we find equations for the functions which are the coefficients of the expansions:\n\u03bc+l\n\u03bb\nJ \u0307l + Hl\u2032 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)Jl +\n(Jl \u2212 Hl ) = e\u2212\u03c4 ,\ny\n2\n\n\u1e22l + Jl\u2032 + Hl \u2212\n\n\u03bc+l\n(Jl \u2212 Hl ) = 0.\ny\n\n(38)\n\nWe now transform to the variables \u03c4 and y, on which these functions depend. Then the new equations take the form\n\u2202\n\u03bc+l\n\u03bb\n\u2202Hl\n+\n(Jl \u2212 Hl ) +\n(Jl \u2212 Hl ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)Jl = e\u2212\u03c4 ,\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202y\ny\n2\n\n\u2202Jl\n\u2202\n\u03bc+l\n\u2212\n(Jl \u2212 Hl ) \u2212\n(Jl \u2212 Hl ) + Hl = 0.\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202y\ny\n\n(39)\n\nAdding these equations yields\n\n\u2202\n\u03bb\n(Jl + Hl ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)Jl + Hl = e\u2212\u03c4 .\n(40)\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\nAs y \u2192 0, Eqs. (39) imply that Jl (\u03c4, 0) = Hl (\u03c4, 0), while in the expansions (37) only the zeroth order terms\nJ0 (\u03c4, 0) = H0 (\u03c4, 0) remain. Taking the same limit in Eq. (40) and using the equality above yields the following, easily\nintegrable linear differential equation:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\ndJ0 (\u03c4, 0)\nJ0 (\u03c4, 0) = e\u2212\u03c4 .\n+ 1\u2212\n(41)\nd\u03c4\n2\n4\nSolution of Eq. (41) gives the function that depends on \u03c4 in the term under the integral in Eq. (27) subject to the\nboundary condition (33): J0 (\u03c4, 0) = A(\u03c4 ).\n5\n\n\fIt is clear from Eqs. (38) or (39) that the index \u03bc and number l appear in them only as a sum. Thus it is\nappropriate to use the notation \u03bc + l + 1 = z and regard this sum as an implicit argument of the functions Jl (\u03c4, y) and\nHl (\u03c4, y). Hence, we can write the expansion for these functions at early times and for small values of the coordinate\nin the form\n\u221e X\nm\n\u221e X\nm\nX\nX\nHm,j (z, \u03bb)\u03c4 m\u2212j y j ,\n(42)\nJm,j (z, \u03bb)\u03c4 m\u2212j y j , Hl (\u03c4, y) =\nJl (\u03c4, y) =\nm=0 j=0\n\nm=0 j=0\n\nwhere the parameters \u03bb and z are indicated as arguments of the coefficients with their two indices. In the following\nwe shall often omit these arguments.\nEquality of these functions at y = 0 requires that Jm,0 (z, \u03bb) = Hm,0 (z, \u03bb). The fact that the flux is zero at \u03c4 = 0\nleads to the following condition\n\u221e\nX\nHl (0, y) =\nHm,m (z, \u03bb)y m = 0,\n(43)\nm=0\n\nso that Hm,m (z, \u03bb) = 0 for all m.\nSubstituting expansion (42) into Eq. (39), we obtain a pair of recurrence relations (omitting the arguments z and\n\u03bb),\n(m + 1 \u2212 j)Hm+1,j + (z + j)(Jm+1,j+1 \u2212 Hm+1,j+1 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)Jm,j =\n(m + 1 \u2212 j)Jm+1,j \u2212 (z + j)(Jm+1,j+1 \u2212 Hm+1,j+1 ) + Hm,j\n\n\u03bb (\u22121)m\n\u03b4j,0 ,\n2 m!\n= 0.\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nAdding these two equations yields a simple formula which follows from Eq.

However, the values of Jm+1,0 = Hm+1,0 are known, while Hm+1,m+1 = 0, so that\none of the equations is redundant. This equation, the sum of a pair of equations (for j = 0), i.e., Eq. (47), has been\nsolved for all m. The procedure for solving the equations for all m is the same. First we find the difference in the\ncoefficients with one value of j, and then their sum, going from smaller to larger j. Here z enters as a parameter.\n\nGiven that J0,0 = H0,0 = 0, J1,0 = H1,0 =\n\n9. Expansions of the exact solutions. The method of obtaining recurrence relations for the coefficients of the\nexpansion can be applied to more complicated and more general equations, including those with variable coefficients\nin front of derivatives. We suppose to use it for calculating the radiation fields in an expanding universe. In this work,\nit is possible to obtain expansions for the functions from their explicit expressions.\nSuccessively expanding the Bessel functions and exponents under the integral sign in Eqs. (20) and then integrating\nwith respect to t1 and equating all the terms in the form of functions of \u03c4 and y, for the average intensity we find the\nexpansion coefficients for m \u2265 1 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m to be\n\u03bb\nJm,j (z, \u03bb) = Bj (z)\n4\n\n[(m\u2212j)/2]\n\nX\n\nJ m\u22121,k (\u03bb)\n\nk=0\n\n6\n\n(m \u2212 2k \u2212 1)!\n,\n(m \u2212 2k \u2212 j)!\n\n(50)\n\n\fwhere the square brackets in the upper limit of the sum denote taking the integer part, while\nBj (z) =\n\nj\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n(\u22121)i\n,\ni!(j \u2212 i \u2212 1)!(z + i)\n\nz = \u03bc + l + 1.\n\n(51)\n\nThe coefficient under the summation sign, which depends on \u03bb, is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n[m/2]\n(\u22121)k+m X\n\u03bb m \u2212 2n\n\u03bb2n \u03bb1m\u22122n\nJ m,k (\u03bb) =\n1\u2212\n,\nk!\n24n n!(n \u2212 k)!(m \u2212 2n)!\n4\u03bb1 n + 1\n\n(52)\n\nn=k\n\nwhere \u03bb1 = 1 \u2212 \u03bb/2.\nThe coefficients in the expansion for the flux are obtained in a similar way (m \u2265 1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m):\n\u03bb2\nHm+1,j (z, \u03bb) =\nBj (z)\n16\nH m,k (\u03bb) =\n\n[(m\u2212j)/2]\n\nX\n\nH m\u22121,k (\u03bb)\n\nk=0\n\n(m \u2212 2k \u2212 1)!\n,\n(m \u2212 2k \u2212 j)!\n\n[m/2]\n\u03bb2n \u03bb1m\u22122n\n(\u22121)k+m X\n.\nk!\n24n (n + 1)!(n \u2212 k)!(m \u2212 2n)!\n\n(53)\n\n(54)\n\nn=k\n\nThe coefficients obtained from the exact formulas and from the recurrence relations (44)\u2013(45) are the same.\n10.

(20) should be taken to be\nmin(t \u2212 |\u03c4 |, ts ). The rest of the equations are valid without changes. In particular, the expansions for a bell-shaped\nsource can be obtained by noting that in the expansion of Eq. (55), only even coefficients are nonzero:\n(\u22121)l\nL2l = 2L0\n(2l + 2)!\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nts\n\n\u00132l\n\n,\n\nL2l+1 = 0,\n\nL0 = L(0) = 2\u03c0 2\n\nc\u03bc\n1+\u03bc .\nts\n\n(56)\n\nThe moments of the power are given by the series\nLn = 4\u03c0 2 c\u03bc\n\n\u221e\nX\n(2\u03c0)2l\n(\u22121)l\n.\n(2l + 2)! 2l + 1 + \u03bc + n\n\n(57)\n\nl=0\n\nThe normalizing coefficient is determined by the condition L0 = 1. In particular, c0 = 0.11223, c1 = 0.41023, c2 = 1 and\nc3 = 2.\nAs a comparison, Table 1 lists the asymptotic (Eqs. (22)\u2013(23)) and numerically exact values of these quantities\nfor t = 20 and a number of values of \u03c4 . Naturally, the accuracy deteriorates with increasing \u03c4 .\n7\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nt\nFig. 1. The term outside the integrals in Eqs.

The curves correspond to those values of \u03c4 from which they begin on the abscissa. In the figures we can\nsee only the tendency of approaching to the asymptotes.\n11. Numerical method. Several direct methods of solving the system of Eqs. (28) based on discretizing the\nequations were tried. The most suitable was the Lax-Wendroff method. This method is usually prescribed for partial\ndifferential equations with zero right hand sides [10]\u2013[13], but it is easy to generalize it to systems with nonzero right\nhand sides.\nThis method turned out to be sufficiently stable if it was applied to equations of the form (28) for a source with\npower given by Eq. (30) with integer values of the parameter \u03bc. Here we illustrate this numerical method for the case\nof pure scattering, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bc = 2. For brevity we omit the index d. The equations take the form\n1\nJ \u0307 + H\u2032 = e\u2212\u03c4 L(y),\n2\n\n\u1e22 + J \u2032 + H = 0.\n\n(58)\n\nIf the unknown functions have already been found at some time t for a set of values of the coordinate \u03c4 , then\naccording to this method the values for subsequent times and the same coordinates are found using a second order\nTaylor expansion,\nJ (t + \u2206t, \u03c4 ) = J (t, \u03c4 ) + J \u0307 (t, \u03c4 )\u2206t + J \u0308(t, \u03c4 )\n\n(\u2206t)2\n,\n2\n\nH(t + \u2206t, \u03c4 ) = H(t, \u03c4 ) + \u1e22(t, \u03c4 )\u2206t + \u1e26(t, \u03c4 )\n\n(\u2206t)2\n.\n2\n\n(59)\n\nThe time derivatives can be expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to the coordinate using Eqs. (58).\nLet us discretize the variables, taking equal step h in time and in the coordinate: ti = hi, \u03c4j = hj, i = 0(1)i0 ,\nj = 0(1)i. The region of the discretized points is shown schematically in Fig. 4. As the initial time we take\nt\u2217 = ti\u2217 = i\u2217 h, where the number i\u2217 is defined below. We calculate the values of the unknown functions at this time\nusing their expansions (37) and (42). The coefficients in the expansions are found either using the recurrence relations\n(44)\u2013(45) or from their exact expressions (50)\u2013(54).\nWe denote the values of the unknown functions at the nodal points by Ji,j = J (ti , \u03c4j ) and Hi,j = H(ti , \u03c4j ) and\nthat of the source power, by Li\u2212j = L(h(i \u2212 j)). The corresponding values of the derivatives are indicated, as before,\nby a dot and a prime. A prime also indicates a derivative with respect to the argument of the function L(t). The\nnumerical values of the derivatives with respect to the coordinate are calculated using the formulas\n\u2032\nJi,j\n\u2248\n\nHi,j+1 \u2212Hi,j\u22121\nJi,j+1 \u22122Ji,j +Ji,j\u22121\nHi,j+1 \u22122Hi,j +Hi,j\u22121\nJi,j+1 \u2212Ji,j\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n, Hi,j\n\u2248\n.\n, Ji,j\n\u2248\n, Hi,j\n\u2248\n2\n2h\nh\n2h\nh2\n8\n\n(60)\n\n\f0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n12\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n14\nt\nFig.2.

The scheme for discretizing the equations.\nAs a result of discretization, we obtain a system of discrete recurrence relations of the type (for i > i\u2217 , with j =\n1, ..., i \u2212 1)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0003\nh \u2212jh \u0002\nJi,j+1 + Ji,j\u22121\nh Hi,j+1 \u2212 Hi,j\u22121\n\u2032\nJi+1,j = e\n2Li\u2212j + hLi\u2212j \u2212 1 \u2212\n+\n,\n(61)\n4\n2\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\nh2 \u2212jh\nJi,j+1 \u2212 Ji,j\u22121\nHi,j+1 + Hi,j\u22121\nh\nHi+1,j =\nHi,j \u2212\ne\nLi\u2212j + L\u2032i\u2212j \u2212 h 1 \u2212\n+\n.\n(62)\n4\n2\n2\n2\nThe boundary conditions (33) imply that\n\nJi,i = Hi,i = 0\n\n(63)\n\nfor all i. The values of the unknown functions below the boundary t = \u03c4 (at the points with j = i \u2212 1) indicated by\nasterisks in Fig. 4, were obtained by interpolation using Newton's formula with three points j = i + 1, i \u2212 1, i \u2212 2:\nJi+1,i = Ji+1,i\u22121 \u2212 Ji+1,i\u22122 /3,\n\nHi+1,i = Hi+1,i\u22121 \u2212 Hi+1,i\u22122 /3.\n\n(64)\n\nThe flux at the source is equal to zero, and the value of J at \u03c4 = 0 was found by extrapolation. Thus, for all i, we\nhave\nHi,0 = Hi+1,0 = 0, Ji,0 = 3(Ji,1 \u2212 Ji,2 ) + Ji,3 .\n(65)\nThe following order of calculations was employed: first, for the chosen step size h the values of the unknown\nfunctions were calculated from their expansions for i = i\u2217 . Then a transition to larger values of i was made in\nsuccession: for j = 1, ..., i \u2212 1 from i to i + 1, using Eqs. (61)\u2013(62), for j = i + 1 using Eqs. (63), and for j = 0 and\nj = i using the values already calculated according to Eqs. (64) and (65).\nDuring the calculations, with increasing i it was necessary to increase the step size, taking the calculated values\nfor the last i as the initial values. The former were taken to be h = 1/2m , t\u2217 = 1/8(i\u2217 = 2m\u22123 ), with m chosen to be\nm = 8 \u2212 10, depending on ts . At t = 5 and then at t = 12, the step size was doubled. The calculation was continued\nup to some number i = i0 when the estimated functions attained their asymptotes with the same accuracy as the\nexact functions.\nA comparison of the numerically determined values of J (ti , \u03c4j ) and H(ti , \u03c4j ) with those calculated with the exact\nformulas showed that for m = 8 and ts = 1, the maximum relative error was 10\u22123 , while for ts = 2 it was 10\u22124 .\nThe error increases as the parameter ts is reduced, since the function (55) becomes narrower and higher (closer to a\n\u03b4-function). When the allowed accuracy is reached, it is necessary to reduce the step size.\nA similar numerical scheme, based on a predictor-correction method, has been developed by MacCormac [14]. It\ncan also be used to solve these problems.\n12. Conclusion. The exact solution of the equations obtained here have made it possible to choose a method\nthat is suitable for solving them numerically and can be used to estimate the parameters required to achieve a given\naccuracy. It is proposed that this method be used for calculating the evolution of the luminosity and polarization of\nsources in the universe during epochs close to the recombination epoch.\n10\n\n\fThis work was partially supported by grant No. NSh-8542.2006.2 from the President of the Russian Federation for\nleading scientific schools.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.
