Introduction\nSelf-avoiding walks have been widely studied as models of polymers in dilute solution[1].\nA self-avoiding walk on a lattice is defined as a random walk which is forbidden from\nvisiting the same lattice-site more than once[1]. In the limit of very long walks it\nmodels a polymer in a good solvent. In order to model the relative affinity between the\nmonomers (compared with the solvent) an attractive energy is introduced between nonconsecutively visited nearest-neighbour sites[2, 3]. This is the standard \u03b8-point model.\nAt high temperatures the polymer is happy to be in solution. As the temperature\nis lowered the polymer tends to collapse in on itself, and at a given temperature will\nprecipitate from solution. For an idealised infinitely long polymer the high temperature\nand low temperature regimes are separated by a phase transition occurring at a\ntemperature known as the theta temperature, T\u03b8 [1, 4, 5]. In the grand-canonical\ndescription the average length of the walk is controlled by a fugacity K (or chemical\npotential \u03bc where K = exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bc)). At high temperatures the (average) length of the\nwalk diverges smoothly as a critical fugacity Kc (T ) is approached. At low temperatures\nthe length jumps discontinuously at a given value of the fugacity K \u2217 (T ) (corresponding\nto a first order transition). The two lines Kc (T ) and K \u2217 (T ) follow continuously one from\nthe other, and the two behaviours are separated by a tricritical point, at a temperature\ncorresponding to T\u03b8 . The transition line Kc (T ) then K \u2217 (T ) is identified with the\n\"thermodynamic limit\" of the polymer problem. Along this line, the proportion of\nvisited sites is zero for T < T\u03b8 and becomes non-zero continuously for T > T\u03b8 .\nWhile it is clear that the main experimental interest lies in three dimensions\n(although there are some experimental results also in two dimensions[6]), there has\nbeen a lot of theoretical interest in the two dimensional case[7, 8, 9]. This is in part\ndue to the fact that the upper critical dimension for a tricritical point is three[10]. In\ndimensions lower than three (but larger than one) there is a possibility for a greater\ndiversity of critical behaviours.\nIn this article we investigate a two-dimensional model with a restricted set of\ninteractions, compared to the theta model; an interaction is only present between\nnearest-neighbour non-consecutively visited sites belonging to straight portions of\npolymer, i.e. an interacting site cannot sit on a corner of the walk (see Figure 2). This\nchoice of interactions may be motivated by the r\u00f4le of hydrogen bonding in the formation\nof secondary structures in proteins[11]. These bonds are formed between the CO group\nof one peptide and the NH group of a nearby (non-consecutive) peptide. This bond\nimposes a constraint on the orientation of the relevent peptides. This type of bonding\nis thought to be responsible for the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets[12].\nIn our two-dimensional toy-model the formation of alpha helices is not possible. A\nrepresentation of the formation of a beta sheet through hydrogen bonding is shown in\nFigure 1.\nOur main interest in this paper is not to give a realistic model for protein folding,\nbut rather to understand the influence of these apparently small modifications to the\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\nCO\n\n3\n\nNH\n\nCO\n\nNH\n\nFigure 1. A schematic representation of hydrogen bonds in a beta sheet (following\nBascle et al [11])\n\nlocal attractive interactions on the critical behaviour of lattice interacting self-avoiding\nwalks. To this end we present the phase diagram and elucidate the critical behaviour\nin the full fugacity-temperature plane.\nIn the following section we present in detail the model as well as the transfer matrix\ncalculation of the quantities of interest. In section 3 we present the phase diagram and\ndiscuss the different transitions present. In section 4 we concentrate more specifically\non the Hamiltonian Walk limit of the model in which all sites are visited exactly once.\nIn section 5 we finish with some concluding remarks.\n2. The model and the transfer matrix calculation\nThe model studied here consists of a self-avoiding walk embedded on a square lattice.\nAn interaction energy \u2212\u01eb is assigned for each non-consecutively visited pair nearestneighbour sites for which the four bonds are parallel (see figure 2). A chemical potential,\n\u03bc, and related fugacity K = exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bc) are associated to each step.\nThe grand canonical partition function is then\nZ=\n\nX\n\nK N exp(\u03b2NI \u01eb),\n\n(1)\n\nwalks\n\nwhere N is the number of steps in the walk and NI is the number of interactions.\nQuantities of interest may be calculated as appropriate derivatives of the partition\nfunction, for example, the density is given by:\nK \u2202 log Z\nhNi\n=\n,\n(2)\n\u03a9\n\u03a9 \u2202K\nwhere \u03a9 is the number of lattice sites. The relative length fluctuations are related to\n\u03c1=\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n4\n\nFigure 2. Possible configurations of nearest-neighbour non-consecutively visited sites.\nConfigurations of type (a) include an attractive interaction energy \u2212\u01eb, configurations\nof types (b), (c) and (d) interact in the standard \u03b8-point model, but here do not\nparticipate in hydrogen type bonding.\n\nthe derivative of \u03c1 through:\nK \u2202\u03c1\nhN 2 i \u2212 hNi2\n=\n.\nhNi\n\u03c1 \u2202K\n\n(3)\n\n.\nIn the dilute polymer regime (small enough K) the correlation function may be\nidentified with the probability that two given points are joined by a walk. In this case\nthe correlation length must scale in the same way as any reasonable characteristic length\nscale associated to the walk. It is usual to take the radius of gyration, which corresponds\nto the average squared distance the walk steps from the common centre of gravity. It\nfollows that\nRG \u223c |K \u2212 Kc |\u2212\u03bd ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bd is defined as the standard correlation length exponent[13] . Using the relation\n(2), one finds\nRG \u223c hNi\u03bd ,\n\n(5)\n\nfrom which we may see that the walk is fractal; the mass of the walk scales linearly\n1/\u03bd\nwith N, and hence RG . The fractal (Haussdorf)[14] dimension of the walk is then\ndH = 1/\u03bd[1]. It is usual in such problems to take equation (5) as the definition of the\nexponent \u03bd[1]. In this case, note that it only relates to the usual critical exponent in the\ncase of a critical transition in the dilute regime. In the collapsed phase(s) the polymer\nd\nfills the lattice, the mass scales as RG\nand equation (5) gives \u03bd = 1/d.\nIn this article we propose to use a transfer matrix formalism to calculate Z as a\nfunction of K and \u03b2\u01eb[15, 16, 17]. For convenience we shall from now on set \u01eb = 1, which\nsimply corresponds to a choice of temperature scale.\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Example of a polymer configuration with the corresponding column states\n\nThe idea behind the transfer matrix formalism is to calculate the partition function\non a lattice which is infinite in one direction (the x direction, say) but finite in the other\n(y) direction. The thermodynamic limit is attained by increasing the lattice width.\nThe standard way of considering the problem is as follows: Define the restricted\npartition function Zx (C0 , Cx ) as the partition function for a portion of walk between the\norigin and x. The walk has a column state C0 at the origin and Cx in column x. One\nmay then write the following recursion relation:\nZx+1 (C0 , Cx+1 ) =\n\nX\n\nZx (C0 , Cx )T (Cx , Cx+1 ),\n\n(6)\n\nCx\n\nwhere T (Cx , Cx+1 ) is the additional Boltzmann weight to add column x + 1 in\nconfiguration Cx+1 next to column x in configuration Cx . This forms a (transfer) matrix.\nThat this recursion should be valid for a spin system is fairly straightforward, since\nthe interactions are all local. For a polymer model it is less clear that this should be\npossible, since one has to take into account non-local factors, most notably one has to\nensure that the partition function describes only one chain, without the formation of\n\"orphan\" loops. This is done by appropriately defining the column states Cx . For the\nself-avoiding walk problem with no added interactions (i.e. \u01eb = 0) it is sufficient[15] to\ndefine a column configuration by the arrangement of horizontal bonds in the column\nalong with information about the connectivities between the bonds, that is information\nabout which pairs of horizontal bonds are connected by polymer loops to the left (taking\nx as increasing towards the right). See figure 3 for an example. By successive application\nof (6), one finds\nZx (C0 , Cx ) = hC0 |T x |Cx i.\n\n(7)\n\nThe situation becomes a little more complicated if interactions are to be taken\ninto account. It is necessary to know the column states over three columns in order to\nincorporate the horizontal bonds. The appropriate modification to the above equations\nis[16, 18]:\nZx+1 (C0 , C1 ; Cx , Cx+1 ) =\n\nX\n\nC \u2032 x\u22121 ,C \u2032 x\n\nZx (C0 , C1 ; C \u2032 x\u22121 C \u2032 x )T (C \u2032 x\u22121 , C \u2032 x ; Cx , Cx+1 ),(8)\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n6\n\nand\nZx (C0 , C1 ; Cx\u22121 , Cx ) = hC0 , C1 |T x\u22121 |Cx\u22121 , Cx i.\n\n(9)\n\nThe primed configurations are introduced to retain the matrix notation, the elements\nof the matrix are now labelled by the two column states for the input and two for the\noutput (primed), with the restriction that only matrix elements with Cx = C \u2032 x may be\nnon-zero.\nIt is required that the partition function sum over walks of all possible lengths. To\ndo this we define a restricted partition function Zx for all the walks having a caliper\nextension x, i.e. walks which are entirely confined to a strip of length x, and extend\nover the entire length of the strip. This is simply Zx summed over all configurations\nC0 , C1 , Cx\u22121 and Cx compatible with the starting and ending configurations of the walk.\nThe full partition function is then given by\nZ=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nZx+1 ,\n\n(10)\n\nx=0\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX X\n\u2032\n\nb.c.\n\nTx\n\n(11)\n\nx=0\n\nwhere the primed sum is over the boundary configurations, as described above.\nLet us denote by {\u03bbi } the eigenvalues of T , numbered in order of their moduli. The\neigenvalue of largest modulus, \u03bb1 , is always positive.\nFor small enough K, \u03bb1 \u2264 1. In this case the partition function may be written\nX\n\u03b1i\n.\n(12)\nZ=\ni 1 \u2212 \u03bbi (K, \u03b2\u01eb)\nThe \u03b1i are essentially constants dependent on the boundary conditions, which gives for\nthe density:\nK X 1 \u2202\u03bbi\n\u03c1=\n.\n(13)\n\u03a9 i 1 \u2212 \u03bbi \u2202K\nIf the derivative of \u03bbi is finite, which is the case at least for small enough \u03b2, the density\nis zero as long as \u03bb1 < 1 and may only change from its zero value when the average\nlength of the walk diverges, i.e. \u03bb1 \u2265 1[17, 18]. The point \u03bb1 = 1 is identified with the\ncritical transition, and is often used in polymer science to define the \"thermodynamic\nlimit\" of \"very long\" polymers[1]. Another way of reaching to the same conclusion is\nto consider two points as being correlated if they are joined by a walk. One may then\nidentify Zx with a two point correlation function, and hence identify the correlation\nlength, \u03be[17]:\n1\n\u0010 \u0011.\n(14)\n\u03be=\nlog \u03bb11\nThe correlation length diverges as \u03bb1 \u2192 1, consistent with the identification of a critical\ntransition.\nThe above argument needs to be treated with caution. As long as the lattice width\nis finite, the system is equivalent to a one-dimensional system with a finite, if large,\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n7\n\nnumber of states per site (each site corresponding to a column in our model). It is well\nknown that a one dimensional system with a finite number of states per site cannot have\nan equilibrium phase transition[19].\nThe reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the definition of \u03be (14) is not valid\nin the large K phase (dense polymer phase). In a spin model the partition function\nwould have been given by Zx in the limit x \u2192 \u221e. The transfer matrix would contain\nall the possible configurations, and a standard analysis shows that[20]:\n1\n\u0011,\n\u0010\n(15)\n\u03be=\nlog |\u03bb\u03bb01 |\nwhere \u03bb0 is the largest eigenvalue, and \u03bb1 is the second largest (in modulus). To ensure\nthe correct construction of a single walk all configurations consisting of an empty column\nhave been excluded from the transfer matrix, but replaced by the sum over all possible\npolymer extensions x. The consequence of this choice is that the largest eigenvalue in\nthe zero-density phase has been eliminated. Its value, as can be seen by inspection of\nthe expression for \u03be, would be \u03bb0 = 1.\nThis prescription only holds as long as \u03bb1 < 1. If \u03bb1 > 1 then the partition function,\ndensity and \u03be are given by:\nZ \u223c lim \u03bbx1 ,\nx\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c1 =\n\u03be =\n\nK \u2202\u03bb1\nL\u03bb1 \u2202K\n1\nlog\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bb1\n|\u03bb2 |\n\n\u0011,\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n\nwhere L is the lattice width.\nFor convenience we impose the condition that the walk of extension x\u2032 in the x\ndirection originates at x = 0 and terminates either at x = 0 or x = x\u2032 . As is\nusual in equilibrium phase transitions, the precise choice of boundary condition does\nnot change the critical behaviour. Imposing this restriction it is easy to see that\ncolumn configurations with even numbers of horizontal bonds may only follow column\nconfigurations with even numbers of horizontal bonds, and likewise for configurations\nwith an odd number of horizontal bonds. This block diagonalisation is convenient since\nit transpires that for much of the phase diagram \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 arise in different blocks.\nIt is relatively easy to calculate the largest eigenvalues of a matrix using the power\nmethod[21].\n3. The K \u2212 \u03b2 phase diagram\nThe critical lines may be identified using phenomenological renormalisation[22]. At a\ncritical point the correlation lengths for two strip widths, measured as a fraction of the\nstrip width, must be the same. This reflects the scale invariance of a critical system. In\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n8\n\npractice a finite width system is always off-critical, however\n\u03beL\u2032 (K \u2217 )\n\u03beL (K \u2217 )\n=\n(19)\nL\nL\u2032\ngives a finite-size estimate of the critical fugacity, K \u2217 , which will tend to the true critical\nfugacity as the strip widths tend to infinity. Assuming that the system is sufficiently\nclose to the true critical point, the correlation length behaves (to leading order) as\n\u03beL = A|K \u2217 \u2212 Kc |\u2212\u03bd .\n\n(20)\n\nSince it is the finite width of the system which prevents the correlation length from\ndiverging, at K \u2217 we have L \u221d \u03beL . If these two scaling laws are admitted, then a finitesize estimate of the correlation length exponent may be calculated from the equation:\n1\n\u03bdL,L\u2032\n\n=\n\nlog\n\n\u0010\n\nd\u03beL d\u03beL\u2032\n/\ndK dK\n\u0010 \u0011\nlog LL\u2032\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212 1.\n\n(21)\n\nThere exists at least one phase transition. In the case \u03b2 = 0 this corresponds to\nthe standard Self-Avoiding Walk transition. As \u03b2 is increased, this point extends into a\nline of critical points. In analogy to the standard \u03b8-point model, we would expect this\ntransition to change to first order at some given value of \u03b2 = \u03b2H . As discussed in the\nprevious section, starting from the low-K phase, the correlation function is given by (14).\nIn the high-K phases the appropriate form of \u03be is given by (15). The phase diagram\nestimates found using phenomenological renormalisation, using the appropriate form of\n\u03be, are shown in figure 4. As is usual in this sort of problem, there are strong parity\neffects, notably for the odd lattice widths \u03bb1 is in the odd sector of the transfer matrix,\nwhile for the even lattice widths \u03bb1 is taken from the even sector. The next largest\neigenvalue, \u03bb2 , is in the other sector for the low-K phase and for the high temperature\nhigh-K phase, while it is in the same sector for the high-K low temperature phase.\nThis observation was not used to estimate the transition lines, which were however\nfound assuming that \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 came from different sectors of the transfer matrix. Not\nall the transition lines are found for even lattice widths.\nLet us now characterise the different phases and transitions. For low K the average\nlength of polymer is finite, the density of the polymer on the lattice must therefore be\nzero. The first transition as K is increased is to one of two dense phases, depending on\nwhether \u03b2 < \u03b2H or \u03b2 > \u03b2H . It is convenient to use the density as an order parameter.\nFor practical reasons we choose boundary conditions in which the polymer is made to\nextend the length of the lattice, between x = 0 and x \u2192 \u221e. This obliges the polymer\nto be infinite in length even in the zero-density phase. A choice of boundary conditions\nis not expected to affect the critical behaviour of an equilibrium system. The partition\nfunction becomes Z = limx\u2192\u221e \u03bbx1 for both the high and low density phases, and \u03c1 may\nbe calculated using (17) in all phases. The density will now be finite for K < Kc as long\nas the lattice width is finite, but must tend to zero as L \u2192 \u221e. This is indeed what is\nobserved from the density plots shown in figures 5 and 6.\nFor \u03b2 < \u03b2H the behaviour of \u03c1 and the length flucuations indicate the existence\nof a line of second order phase transitions, as expected. The line is in the self-avoiding\n\n\f9\n\nTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n2\nsizes 3 and 5\nsizes 5 and 7\nsizes 7 and 9\nK =exp(\u2212beta)\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c1 finite\n\nK\n\n\u03c1=1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c1=0\n0\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n2\nsizes 2 and 4\nsizes 4 and 6\nsizes 6 and 8\nK =exp(\u2212beta)\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c1 finite\n\u03c1=1\n\nK\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c1=0\n0\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\nFigure 4.

The transition is to a finite density phase.\nFor \u03b2 > \u03b2H the density plot, given in figure 6, indicates that the transition is first\norder to a dense phase. That this line corresponds to the compact polymer state is\nconfirmed by the observed exponent \u03bd = 0.5 = 1/d, see figure 7. A major difference\nwith the \u03b8-point model, seen using the phenomenological renormalisation scheme is the\nexistence of two different high density phases. The density plots in figure 6 for \u03b2 > \u03b2H\nsuggest that the walk changes discontinuously from \u03c1 = 0 to \u03c1 = 1, and that the\ndensity of interactions saturates instantly. In other words the lattice changes abruptly\nfrom being essentially empty to essentially full, with a maximum density of interactions.\nTrivially, a lattice which is empty (a finite walk length on an infinite lattice) has zero\n\n\f10\n\nTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1\n0.4\n\nL=3\nL=5\nL=7\nL=9\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nK\n\n3\n\nL=3\nL=5\nL=7\nL=9\n\n2\n\n<\u039d >\u2212<\u039d>\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n<\u039d>\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nK\n\nFigure 5.

If the lattice is\ncompletely full with the interactions density saturated, the walk may only be in one of\ntwo configurations; either all the bonds are vertical or all the bonds are horizontal.

The transition between\nthe two phases would then occur when the free energy per site, f = e \u2212 T s = e = 0, in\nother words when \u03bc = \u01eb. Remembering the choice \u01eb = 1, the transition line would be\nK = exp(\u2212\u03b2). This line has been plotted for comparison on the phase diagrams, shown\nin figure 4.

This order parameter, along with its\nfluctuations, is plotted as a function of \u03b2 for K = 1.5 in figure 8. The order parameter\ndifferentiates between the two phases since it is identically one in the high-\u03b2 phase,\nand less than one in the low-\u03b2 phase. The variation of the order parameter appears to\nbe fairly smooth for all lattice sizes, and leads one to conjecture that this high density\ntransition is critical. Also plotted in figure 8 is the specific heat, calculated as the second\nderivative of the free energy with respect to the temperature, keeping \u03bc and \u01eb constant.\nVarious estimates of the critical \u03b2 for K = 1.5, calculated using the\nphenomenological renormalisation group and by locating the peaks in the specific heat,\nare given in table 1. The various results are coherent with an estimate \u03b2c (K = 1.5) =\n.55\u00b10.01. At a critical transition, the specific heat diverges as T \u2192 Tc with an exponent\n\u03b1,\nC \u223c |T \u2212 Tc |\u03b1 .\n\n(22)\n\nWhen combined with relation (20) and \u03beL \u221d L, this leads to the finite-size scaling result\nCmax \u2248 A + BL\u03b1/\u03bd .\n\n(23)\n\nA three point fit for odd widths gives \u03b1/\u03bd = 0.67 for L = 3, 5, 7 and \u03b1/\u03bd = 0.55 for\nL = 5, 7, 9. A similar three point fit for the even sizes, L = 4, 6, 8 gives a value of\n\u03b1/\u03bd = 0.156. If sufficiently large lattice widths are considered then A can be dropped.\nWhen this is not the case, then the result is an effective value of the exponent, which\nshould converge to the correct value as the lattice width is increased. Unfortunately the\nnumber of two point approximations we could construct does not allow for meaningful\nextrapolation. All we could determine is that 0.156 \u2264 \u03b1/\u03bd \u2264 0.55 gives a reasonable\nlimit on the possible values of \u03b1/\u03bd. Using the scaling relation \u03b1 = 2 \u2212 d\u03bd, this gives \u03bd\nas 0.78 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 0.93. Note that this range is coherent with the values of \u03bd found from the\nphenomenological renormalisation group calculation, shown in table 1. Additionally,\nthe upper boundary, calculated from the even lattice sizes, is in good agreement with\nthe even lattice size estimates of \u03bd in table 1.\nIt now remains to determine the nature of the transition at (KH , \u03b2H ), where the\nthree transition lines join. For the standard \u03b8 point model, this point is tricritical, and\ncorresponds to the confluent of two transition lines, not three.\nThe problem we are faced with is that the phenomenological renormalisation group\napplied to even lattice widths does not give the first-order transition at all. When\napplied to the odd lattice widths, the method is not able to follow the self-avoiding walk\ntransition line all the way to \u03b2H , jumping to the upper transition line just short of \u03b2H .\nThis undershoot rapidly becomes smaller as the lattice width is increased. Remembering\nthat the length of the walk first diverges when \u03bb1 \u2192 1 and that this condition coincides\nwith the low-K phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit, we can use the condition\n\u03bb1 (K, \u03b2) = 1 as a criterion for defining finite width estimates to the transition lines.\nThe phase diagram estimates calculated using this criterion are shown in figure 9. This\nmethod is incapable of giving the high-K transitions, and converges more slowly than\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n14\n\nTable 1.

The density and its fluctuations, calculated\nalong this line, are presented in figure 10. As the width of the lattice is increased,\nthe jump in the density becomes sharper. The height of the fluctuations (shown with\na log-linear scalin in figure 11) increases extreemly rapidly with lattice width, stronly\nsuggesting a delta peak in the thermodynamic limit. Whilst the range of lattice widths\nprevent us from being categorical, the results suggest strongly that the transition is first\norder along the transition line. This seems to confirmed in the phase diagram. In both\nfigures 4 and 9 the transition line has a discontinuous slope at \u03b2H .\nThe positions of the peaks of density fluctuations are shown in figure 11 along with\nthe positions of the cusps where the upper and lower critical lines join for even lattice\nwidths. We estimate \u03b2H = 1.00 \u00b1 0.02, with KH = exp(\u2212\u03b2H ). It is curious that \u03b2H\nshould be so close to one, though we have as yet not been able to determine why this\nshould be the case.\n4. The Hamiltonian Walk limit (K \u2192 \u221e)\nIn the limit K \u2192 \u221e the walk will fill the lattice maximally. Each site will be visited\nonce and only once. In this limit the walk becomes what is known as an Hamiltonian\nWalk[24]. In this limit the effect of the interaction is to energetically penalise corners\nin the walk. This is similar to the Flory model[26] except that there are configurations\nwhich introduce one or two corners into the walk with no difference in energy, see\nfigure 2.\nThere is a low-temperature corner-free phase. As the temperature is raised there is\na transition in which the density of corners becomes non-zero. To distinguish between\nthe high and low temperature phases it is possible to use either the density of corners\nthe energy density. This latter is shown, as a function of \u03b2 in figure 12.\nWe estimate the critical temperature again using the phenomenological\n\n\f15\n\nTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n0.5\nL=3\nL=5\nL=7\nL=9\nK=exp(\u2212beta)\n\n0.4\n\nK\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03b2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n1\nL=4\nL=6\nL=8\nK=exp(\u2212beta)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nK\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03b2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 9.

The estimates of \u03bd are not at all clear. They\nseem close to \u03bd = 1, but in other respects the transition is similar to that seen in the\nmodel F and the Flory model, which have transitions of infinite order with \u03bd infinite.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this article we have presented a two-dimensional model for homopolymer collapse\nunder the influence of \"hydrogen-bonding\" like nearest-neighbour interactions. The\nphase diagram is quite different from the equivalent \u03b8 point phase diagram; the collapse\ntransition is now first order. This is also observed in the oriented interacting selfavoiding walk model, where, for appropriate values of the model parameters, a first\n\n\f19\n\nTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\nenergy fluctuations\n\n3\n\n2\n\nL=3\nL=5\nL=7\nL=9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nenergy fluctuations\n\n3\n\n2\n\nL=4\nL=6\nL=8\nL=10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 13. The energy fluctuations in the K \u2192 \u221e limit for odd lattice widths (top)\nand even lattice widths (bottom)\n\norder collapse occurs to a spiral configuration[28]. These two models have in common\nthat the collapsed phase is anisotropic, in our case one of the two lattice directions is\nselected, and in the oriented walk case, for strong enough parallel interaction strength,\none of two chiralities is selected. In the standard \u03b8 model the collapsed phase is isotropic.\nHere we also observe an additional transition in the dense walk regime. This\ntransition appears to be second order, though for the moment we have not been able\nto determine to any accuracy any of the critical exponents. Similar critical lines\nare observed in the loop models with corner interactions, with or without a collapse\ntransition[27, 29].\nThere also exists non-trivial critical behaviour in the K \u2192 \u221e limit, where there is\na finite temperature phase transition between a critical high temperature phase and a\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n20\n\nfrozen low temperature phase.\nAnother well studied model with a qualitatively similar phase diagram is the\npartially directed interacting polymer model[30, 31]. There are major differences\nhowever: The line K = exp(\u2212\u03b2) corresponds to a phase transition line for all values\nof K, deliminating a similar fully collapsed phase. The equivalent phase to the finite-\u03c1\nphase has a density \u03c1 = 0 due to the directed nature of the model. The equivelent to\nthe theta point transition is second order[30] (here it appears to be first order).\n\n\fTwo dimensional self-avoiding walk with hydrogen-like bonding\n\n21\n\nAcknowledgments\nDPF would like to thank the kind hospitality of the INFM and the Dipartimento di\nFisica, Universit\u00e0 di Padova during the early stages of this work.\nReferences\n[1] de Gennes P G 1979 Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics (Ithaca: Cornell University\nPress)\nVanderzande C 1998 Lattice Models of Polymers (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)\ndes Cloiseaux J and Jannink G 1990 Polymers in Solution: Their Modelling and Structure\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press)\n[2] Wall F T and Mazur J 1961 Ann.
