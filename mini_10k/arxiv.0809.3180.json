These singular configurations can be found using\nanalytical, numerical or geometrical methods (Merlet, 2005). The inverse\nJacobian matrix of a 6-DOF parallel manipulator has Pl\u00fccker coordinate\nvectors of finite lines as its rows. These lines are wrenches of actuation\ndescribing the instantaneous forces of actuation applied by the actuators\non the moving platform. For parallel manipulators of type GoughStewart, parallel singularities occur when lines within legs of the\nmanipulator are linearly dependent, which Merlet, 1989, analyzed using\nGrassmann line geometry. Hao and McCarthy, 1998, have used screw\ntheory to define conditions for line-based singularities. They focused on\n6-DOF parallel manipulators, each leg having at least one actuator and\ntheir last three joints equivalent to a passive spherical joint. These\nconditions ensure that each supporting leg of the system can apply only a\npure force to the platform so that it is possible to characterize all\nsingular configurations in terms of the geometry of linearly dependent\nsets of lines. Ben-Horin and Shoham, 2005 and 2006 analyzed parallel\nsingularities of two classes of 6-DOF parallel manipulators using\n\n\fGrassmann-Cayley algebra (GCA). They used the superbracket and the\nGrassmann-Cayley operators to obtain geometric conditions for\nsingularity, namely, when four planes defined by the direction of the\njoint axes and the location of the spherical joint are concurrent in a point.\nContrary to 6-DOF manipulators, each leg of a limited-DOF parallel\nmanipulator has connectivity less than 6 and, in turn, constraints partly\nthe motion of the moving platform. When a leg loses its ability to\nconstrain the moving platform, a so-called constraint singularity occurs.\nJoshi and Tsai, 2002 developed a methodology for the inverse Jacobian of\nlimited-DOF parallel manipulators with the theory of reciprocal screws.\nA 6x6-inverse Jacobian matrix was defined, the rows of which are\nwrenches that provide information about both architecture1 and\nconstraint singularities. These wrenches, also known as governing lines,\nare actuation and constraint wrenches applied to the moving platform.\nIn this paper, we focus on limited-dof parallel manipulators i.e. that\nhave less than 6-DOF and we are interested in identifying their parallel\nsingularities using GCA. The application of GCA is enlarged to include\nlimited-DOF parallel manipulators, in which the inverse Jacobian is a\n6x6 matrix having not only finite lines (zero pitch screws) as its rows but\nalso infinite lines (infinite pitch screws). In this work, manipulators\nunder consideration do not need to have a passive spherical joint\nsomewhere in each of their legs. The results are illustrated with three\nexample robots.\n\n2.\n\nGrassmann-Cayley Algebra\n\nOriginally developed by H. Grassmann as a calculus for linear\nvarieties, GCA has two operators, namely the join, denoted by \u2228 and the\nmeet, denoted by \u2227 . These two operators are associated with union and\nintersection between vector subspaces of extensors. These extensors\nrepresent geometric entities such as points, lines, planes, etc. in the\nprojective space. GCA makes it possible to work at the symbolic level,\nwhere points and lines are represented in a coordinate-free form by their\nhomogeneous and Pl\u00fccker coordinates, respectively.\nGCA is used in this study to transform the singular geometric\nconditions defined as the dependency between six lines in the 3dimensional projective space P3, into coordinate free algebraic expressions\n\n1\nFollowing Joshi and Tsai, 2002 terminology, an architecture singularity occurs when the\ninverse Jacobian matrix is rank-deficient and the Jacobian of constraints is full-rank.\n\n\finvolving 12 points selected on the axes of these lines. For further details\non GCA concept and its application to robotics see for example (White,\n1994 and 2005, Staffetti and Thomas, 2000, Ben-Horin and Shoham,\n2006) and references therein.\n\n2.1\n\nProjective Space\n\nThe three-dimensional projective space P3 can be considered as the\nunion of 3 with a set of ideal points that are the intersections of\nparallel lines and planes. The set of all such points forms a plane known\nas the plane at infinity, \u03a0\u221e . This plane may be thought of as the set of\nall directions, since all lines with the same particular direction intersect\n\u03a0\u221e in the same unique point and all parallel planes intersect \u03a0\u221e in the\nsame unique line. Hence every line at infinity meets every other line at\ninfinity, and they are therefore all in one plane.\n\n2.2\n\nBracket Ring\n\nConsider a finite set of points {e1, e2,..,ed} defined in the d-dimensional\nvector space, V, over the field . Each point ei is represented by a d-tuple\nby using homogeneous coordinates, where ei=e1,i,e2,i,...,ed,i (1\u2264i\u2264d). The\nbracket of these points is defined as the determinant of the matrix M\nwhose columns are the homogeneous coordinates of these points ei\n(1\u2264i\u2264d):\ne1,1\n[e1 ,e2 ,...,ed ] = det M = M\ned,1\n\ne1,2 K e1,d\nM K M\ned,2 K ed,d\n\n(1)\n\nThe brackets form a subalgebra of the GCA, called the bracket ring or\nbracket algebra. The brackets satisfy the following relations:\n1) [ e1 ,e2 ,...,ed ] = 0 if any ei =ej with i \u2260 j, or e1,e2,...,ed are dependent.\n2) [ e1 ,e2 ,...,ed ] =sign ( \u03c3 ) [ e\u03c31 ,e\u03c32 ,...,e\u03c3d ] for any permutation \u03c3 of\n{1,2,...,d}\nd\n\n3) [ e1 ,e2 ,...,ed ][ f1 ,f2 ,...,fd ] = \u2211 \u23a1\u23a3 f j ,e2 ,...,ed \u23a4\u23a6 \u23a1\u23a3 f1 ,f2 ,...,fj-1 ,e1 ,fj+1 ,...,fd \u23a4\u23a6\nj=1\n\nAll relations among the brackets are consequences of relations of the\nabove three types. The relations of the third type are called GrassmannPl\u00fccker relations or syzygies, and they correspond to generalized Laplace\nexpansions by minors (White, 1975).\n\n\f2.3\n\nThe Superbracket Decomposition\n\nThe inverse Jacobian matrix of a parallel manipulator has the Pl\u00fccker\ncoordinates of 6 lines in the projective space P3 as its rows. The superjoin\nof these six vectors in P5 corresponds to the determinant of their six\nPl\u00fccker coordinate vectors up to scalar multiple, which is the\nsuperbracket in GCA \u039b(V(2)) (White, 1983). Thus, a singularity occurs\nwhen these six Pl\u00fccker coordinate vectors are dependent, which is\nequivalent to a superbracket equal to zero.\nWhite, 1983 and McMillan, 1990, used the theory of projective\ninvariants to decompose the superbracket into expression having\nbrackets involving 12 points selected on the axes of these lines. Let\n[ab,cd,ef,gh,ij,kl] be the superbracket having six 2-extensors as its\ncolumn. These extensors represent lines ab, cd, ef, gh, ij, kl in the\nprojective space, respectively. The expression of this superbracket taken\nfrom Ben-Horin and Shoham, 2006 is as follows\n\n[ab,cd,ef,gh,ij,kl ] = \u23a1\u23a2abc d \u23a4\u23a5 \u23a1\u23a2ef g i \u23a4\u23a5 \u23a1\u23a2h j kl \u23a4\u23a5 \u2212 \u23a1\u23a2abc e \u23a4\u23a5 \u23a1\u23a2d f gh \u23a4\u23a5 \u23a1\u23a2i j kl \u23a4\u23a5\n1 2\n\n\u23a3\n\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\n1 2\n\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\n3 4\n\n\u23a6\n\n\u23a3\n\n3 4\n\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\u23a1\n\u23a4\u23a1\n\u23a4 \u23a1\n\u23a4\u23a1\n\u2212 \u23a2abc e \u23a5 \u23a2d gh i \u23a5 \u23a2 f j kl \u23a5 + \u23a2abc g \u23a5 \u23a2d ef\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\u23a6 \u23a3\n\u23a6\u23a3\n56\n\n5\n\n7\n\n6 7\n\n8 9\n\n8\n\n\u23a6\n\n\u23a4\u23a1\n\u23a4\ni \u23a5 \u23a2h j kl \u23a5\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\n10\n\n9 10\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u23a1\n\u23a4 \u23a1 1 2\u23a4 \u23a1 1 2 \u23a4\nabc\nd\n\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a5\u23a6 \u23a2\u23a3 ef g i \u23a5\u23a6 \u23a2\u23a3h j kl \u23a5\u23a6\ndenotes\n\u23a1\n\u23a4 \u23a1 1 2\u23a4 \u23a1 1 2 \u23a4\nsign (1, 2 ) \u23a2 abc d \u23a5 \u23a2 ef g i \u23a5 \u23a2h j kl \u23a5\n\u2211\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\u23a6\u23a3\n\u23a6\n1,2\n1,2 are permutations of the 2-element sets {g, h}, {i, j}, respectively.\nEquation 2 may be transformed into a linear combination (sum) of 24\nbracket monomials, where each bracket monomial is a product of 3\nbrackets. The monomials in Eq. 2 may be found in (McMillan, 1990 and\nBen-Horin and Shoham, 2006).\n\n3.\n\nSingularity Geometric Conditions\n\nThe aim of this study is to enlarge the application of line geometry to\ninclude limited-DOF manipulators whose legs apply actuation and\nconstraint wrenches to the moving platform. These manipulators do not\nneed to have a passive spherical joint anywhere along their legs and\ntheir 6x6-inverse Jacobian matrix may have Pl\u00fccker coordinate vectors\nof finite and infinite lines as its rows. In this section, we use GCA and\n\n\fthe superbracket decomposition to determine the singularity geometric\nconditions of two classes of parallel manipulators having inverse\nJacobian matrices equivalent to those obtained for 3-UPU translational\nand the parallel module of the Verne machine shown in Fig. 1 and 2.\n\n3.1\n\nSingularity analysis of the 3-UPU translational\nmanipulator\n\nThe 3-UPU manipulator was studied in (Di Gregorio and ParentiCastelli, 1998, Joshi and Tsai, 2002, Wolf and Shoham, 2003, Merlet,\n2005). The moving platform controlled by three linear actuators along\nthe three legs can perform a translational motion when the axes of the\nbase universal joints are parallel to those of the platform universal joints\nof the same leg. Thus each leg i having connectivity equal to 5 applies\n\u02c6 = \u23a1sT ( r \u00d7 s )T \u23a4 T , and one constraint moment,\none actuation force, F\ni\ni\ni\n\u23a3 i\n\u23a6\nT\nM\u0302i = \u23a1\u23a301\u00d73 nTi \u23a4\u23a6 , to the moving platform, where si is a unit vector in the\ndirection of the line of application of the force F\u0302i (leg i), ri is the position\nvector of a point on this line and ni is the cross product of the two vectors\nassociated with the axes of the base U joint of leg i represented by that\nthe direction of the torque associated with the constraint moment M\u0302i .\nEach actuation force, F\u0302i , is a zero pitch screw reciprocal to all joint\nscrews (a joint screw stands for a twist screw associated with the joint) of\nleg i except for the joint screw associated with the actuated prismatic\njoint of the same leg. Each constraint moment, M\u0302i , is an infinite pitch\nscrew reciprocal to all joint screws of leg i. These actuation forces and\nconstraint moments have Pl\u00fccker coordinate vectors of finite and infinite\nlines, respectively, in the 3-dimensional projective space. As a result, the\n6x6- inverse Jacobian matrix will have the Pl\u00fccker coordinate vectors of\n3-finite lines (actuation forces) and 3-infinite lines (constraint moments)\nas its rows. The dependency between these lines is related to the\ndegeneration of the inverse Jacobian matrix, which is equivalent to a\nsuperbracket equal to zero. The transpose of the inverse Jacobian of the\n3-UPU can be expressed as follows (Joshi and Tsai, 2002):\n\n(J )\n\u22121\n\nT\n\n\u23a1 s\n=\u23a2 1\n\u23a3r1 \u00d7 s1\n\u02c6\n= \u23a1F\n\u23a3 1\n\ns2\nr2 \u00d7 s2\n\u02c6\nF\n2\n\ns3\nr3 \u00d7 s3\n\u02c6\nF\n3\n\n\u02c6\nM\n1\n\n01\u00d73\nn1\n\n01\u00d73\nn2\n\n\u02c6\nM\n2\n\n\u02c6 \u23a4\nM\n3\u23a6\n\n01\u00d73 \u23a4\nn3 \u23a5\u23a6\n\n(3)\n\nLet ab, cd, ef, be the finite lines representing the 3-actuation forces Fi\n(i=1, 2, 3), where a, b, c are finite point and b, d, f are points at infinity.\n\n\fAll these points are expressed with their homogeneous coordinates,\nT\nT\nT\nwhere b = ( sT1 0 ) , d = ( sT2 0 ) , f = ( sT3 0 ) . On the other hand, since every\nline at infinity meets every other line at infinity, the three constraint\nmoments M i (i=1..3) can be represented by three infinite lines gh, gi and\nhi, respectively. According to Eq. 2 and due to the repetition of points in\nthe same bracket, we simplify the superbracket expression into a reduced\nnumber of non-zero monomial terms and the superbracket decomposition\nof our manipulator, in turn, reduces to:\n[ ab, cd, ef , gh, gi, hi ] = [ abdf ][cghi ][ eghi ]\n\n(4)\n\nwhere [ abdf ] = ( s1 \u00d7 s2 ) \u22c5 s3 and [ eghi ] = [cghi ] = ( n1 \u00d7 n2 ) \u22c5 n3\ng\n\nM1\n\ns1\n\nM2\n\nd\n\ns2\n\nh\n\ns3\n\nPlane at \u221e\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022f d\n\nb\n\nd\n\nF1\n\nn1\n\nn3\n\n\u2022\n\na\n\n(a)\nf\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nd\n\nb\n\nd\n\n(c)\n\nb\u2261d\n\nF3\n\nF2\n\nn2\n\nf\n\nd\n\n(d)\n\n\u2022\n\nb\u2261 d\u2261f\n\n\u2022\n\n(e)\n\n\u2022c\n(b)\n\nM3\nM2\nM1\n\n(e)\n\ni\n\nM3\n\ne\n\n\u2022\n\nM1\u2261M3\n\nM1\u2261M2\u2261M3\n\nM2\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 1: Geometric conditions for parallel singularities\n\n(h)\n\nThus, the manipulator under study is at a singularity whenever vectors\nsi or ni (i=1..3) verify Eq. 4, which occurs respectively when triangle ghi\nor bdf vanishes (its surface is equal to zero). These two conditions include\nthe cases (c-h) in Fig. 1. Each vertex of triangle bdf is a point at infinity\nrepresenting the direction of an actuation force. In case (c,d), the 3 points\nat infinity b, d and f are coincident, so three vectors si are coplanar. Case\n(d,e) occurs when at least two of the three points b, d, f coincide and so at\nleast two of the three forces are parallel. Each side of the triangle ghi is a\nline at infinity defined as the intersection of a family of parallel planes at\ninfinity, with ni as the normal to these planes. Case (f, g) occurs when\nthe three lines at infinity intersect at the same point, which means that\nthree vectors ni are coplanar. In case (g,h), at least two lines at infinity\nare collinear, which means that their corresponding planes are parallel\nand so at least two of the vectors ni are parallel.\n\n\fThese conditions stand for all manipulators with an inverse Jacobian\nmatrix consisting of three actuation forces and three constraint\nmoments, like for example the 3-UPU translational manipulator and the\nlinear Delta robot (Clavel, 1988). Notice that another condition may\nappear when at least one constraint moment degenerates, meaning that\nat least one line gh, gi or hi degenerates to a point. This condition is more\nrelated to the arrangement of the joint within each leg. For the 3-UPU\nmanipulator, this case can only happen if a universal joint is replaced by\ntwo revolute joints with parallel axes.\n\n3.2\n\nSingularity analysis of the Verne parallel\nmodule\n\nThe parallel module of the Verne machine consists of three legs, leg I,\nII and III (Fig. 2a). Each leg uses pairs of rods linking a prismatic joint to\nthe moving platform through two pairs of spherical joints. Legs \u0399\u0399 and \u0399\u0399\u0399\nare two identical parallelograms. Leg \u0399 differs from the other two legs in\nthat ac \u2260 bd. Leg I does not remain planar (rod directions define skew\nlines) as the machine moves, unlike what arises in the other two legs\nthat are articulated parallelograms. The movement of the moving\nplatform is generated by the slide of three actuators along three vertical\nguideways. We suppose that we are out of the serial singularities and we\nare interested only on studying the parallel singularities.We can thus\nconsider that the transpose of the inverse Jacobian of this manipulator\ncan be expressed as follow:\n\n(J )\n\u22121\n\nT\n\n\u02c6\n= \u23a1F\n\u23a3 11\n\n\u02c6\nF\n12\n\n\u02c6\nF\n21\n\n\u02c6\nF\n22\n\n\u02c6\nF\n31\n\n\u02c6 \u23a4\nF\n32 \u23a6\n\n(5)\n\nT\nThe rows of J \u22121 are zero pitch screws, F\u02c6 ij = \u23a1\u23a3sTij ( rij \u00d7 sij ) \u23a4\u23a6 (i=1..3,\nj=1, 2), represented by finite lines along the six rods, where sij is a unit\nvector in the direction of the rod j within the leg i and rij is the position\nvector of a point on this rod. Each of those screws is an actuation force,\nwhich is reciprocal to all the joint screws of the rod j within the leg i\nexcept for the joint screw associated with the actuated prismatic joint of\nthe same leg. Notice that the pair of actuation forces within legs II and\nIII are parallel, so s21 = s22 and s31 = s32 . The singularity geometrical\nconditions are associated with the dependency between these six\nactuation forces supported by the rods of the Verne parallel module.\nLet ab, cd, ef, gh, ij kl, be respectively the finite lines representing the\nsix actuation forces, where points a, b...,l are finite points located at the\ncenter of spherical joints (Fig. 2). We suppose that lines ef, gh are\nT\n\n\fparallel and intersect at infinity as well as for lines ij, kl. Thus, the\nsuperbracket decomposition of these lines reduces to:\n[ ab, cd, ef , gh, ij, kl ] = [ am, cn, eo, go, ip, kp]\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m = b \u2212 a, n = d \u2212 c, ef \u2227 gh = o = f \u2212 e = h \u2212 g and ij \u2227 kl\n= p = j \u2212i = l \u2212k\nThe shortest form of the superbracket decomposition using the\nalgorithm in (Ben-Horin et al., 2008) will result in the following none\nzero monomial terms:\n\n[oegm][oncp][aipk ] \u2212 [oega ][ oncp][mipk ] \u2212\n[oegn][ omap][cipk ] + [oegc][ omap][nipk]\n\n(7)\n\nAfter collecting equal brackets and applying the shuffles relation (see\nWhite, 2005) caused by the permutation of m, a and n, c, we obtain:\n[ oncp][ oeg m][ a ipk ] \u2212 [ omap][ oeg n][c ipk ] = 0\n\n(8)\n\nApplying the following relation, [(b \u2212 a ) cde ] = [bcde ] \u2212 [ acde ] , we are\nable to replace some points at infinity by finite points and obtain the\nfollowing expression:\n[ ab, cd, ef , gh, ij, kl ] = [ oncp][ feg b][ a ijk ] \u2212 [ omap][ feg d ][c ijk ]\n\n(9)\n\nUsing the meet operator relations (see White, 2005), we prove that:\n\n[ feg b][ a ijk ] = ( ijk \u2227 feg ) \u2227 ba = tu \u2227 ba = [tuba ] and\n[ feg d ][c ijk ] = ( ijk \u2227 feg ) \u2227 dc = tu \u2227 dc = [tudc ]\n\n(10)\n\nwhere tu is the line of intersection of leg II and III planes including\nsuch as: tu = ( ef \u00d7 eg ) \u00d7 ( ij \u00d7 ik )\nOn other hand, it is easy to prove that:\n[ oncp] = [ fepn ] = [ feqr ] and [ omap] = [ feqs ]\n\n(11)\n\nwhere q = e + p , r = q + n and s = q + m\nFinaly, the invariant algebraic expression related to the existence of\nparallel singularities of the parallel module of the Verne machine can be\nstated as:\n[ feqr ][tuba ] \u2212 [ feqs ][tudc ] = 0\n\n(12)\n\nwhere [tuba ] = tu \u22c5 ( ub \u00d7 ab ) , [tudc ] = tu \u22c5 ( ud \u00d7 cd ) , [ feqr ] = cd \u22c5 N and\n[ feqs ] = ab \u22c5 N with N = ef \u00d7 ij\nThe above expression is geometrically equivalent to the difference\nbetween the volume products of two pairs of tetrahedrons with vertices\n\n\fexpressed as function of points a,b,...l as shown in Fig. 2c. This geometric\ncondition includes the following cases: (i). planes of leg II and III are\ncoplanar or parallel ( tu = 0 ); (ii). ef and ij are parallel ( N = 0 ); (iii). ef,\ncd are parallel and ij, ab are parallel or ef, ab are parallel and ij, cd are\nparallel; (iv). ab and cd intersect with tu, in this case the six actuation\nforces form a singular linear complex; (v) ef, cd are parallel and tu, cd are\ncoplanar or ij, cd are parallel and tu, cd are coplanar or ij, ab are parallel\nand tu, ab are coplanar or ef, ab are parallel and tu, ab are coplanar; (vi).\nthe 6 actuation forces form a general linear complex expressed by Eq 13.\n\n[cd \u22c5 N ] \u23a1\u23a3tu \u22c5 ( ub \u00d7 ab )\u23a4\u23a6 \u2212 [ab \u22c5 N ] \u23a1\u23a3tu \u22c5 ( ud \u00d7 cd )\u23a4\u23a6\n\n(13)\n\nThe singularity conditions of the Delta robot are obtained for the\nparticular when cd = ab , thus Eq. 13 is reduced to:\n\n[ab \u22c5 N ] \u23a1\u23a3tu \u22c5 ( db \u00d7 ab )\u23a4\u23a6 = \u23a1\u23a3( s1 \u00d7 s2 ) \u22c5 s3 \u23a4\u23a6 \u23a1\u23a3( n1 \u00d7 n2 ) \u22c5 n3 \u23a4\u23a6\nm\n\n\u2022\n\nPlane at \u221e\ni\n\nk\n\na\n\n\u2022n\nd\n\n\u2022o\n\n\u2022p\nF31\n\nl\n\nj\n\nF11\n\n\u2022a\n\nd\n\n(a)\nr\ne\n\n// ij\n\nV1\n\nf\n\nF21\n\nF12\n\nb\nf\n\nh\n\nd\nq t\n\nV2\n\nu\n\ne\n\n// ij\n\nV3\n\n=\n\nb\n\nf\n\n\u2022 \u2022g\n\nc\nb\n// a\nt\nq\n\nX\n\nF 22\n\nF 32\n\n\u2022\u2022 k\n\ni\n\ne\n\n\u2022c\n\ns\n\na\n\nc\n//\n\nX\n\nd\nd\n\nd\nd\n\nc\n\ne\n\ng\n\n(14)\n\nV4\n\n(b)\nu\n\nd\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2: Singularity Geometrical conditions of the Verne parallel module\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis paper showed how GCA can be used to determine the geometric\nconditions associated with the singular configurations of limited-DOF\nparallel robots whose legs can transmit forces and moments to the\nmoving platform. Three example robots were analyzed as illustrative\nexamples. This method provides a physical meaning and a geometrical\ninterpretation of singular configurations for a familly of parallel\nmanipulators, which is of interest for the designer of new robots.\n\nReferences\n\n\fBen-Horin, P. and Shoham, M.
