The present paper deals with\nthe parametrically driven, damped NLS, for which\nR = he2i\u03a90 t q \u2217 \u2212 i\u03b3q;\n\nh, \u03a90 , \u03b3 > 0.\n\n(2)\n\nThis equation describes nonlinear Faraday resonance in a vertically oscillating water trough [1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; an easy-plane ferromagnet with a combination of a stationary\nand a high-frequency magnetic field in the easy plane [13]; and the effect of phase-sensitive\namplifiers on solitons propagating in optical fibres [14, 15, 16].\nThe equation (1)-(2) has two stationary soliton solutions, one of which is unstable for\nall h and \u03b3 and hence usually disregarded [13]. (The frequency \u03a90 can always be scaled\nto unity leaving h and \u03b3 as the only two control parameters.) The other stationary soliton\nis stable for small values of h but looses its stability to a periodically oscillating soliton as\nh is increased above a certain critical value h = hc (\u03b3), for the fixed \u03b3 [13]. The chart of\nattractors arising as h is increased further, was compiled in [17] and can be summarised\nas follows. If \u03b3 is small, the oscillating soliton undergoes a sequence of bifurcations which\nculminate in a soliton whose amplitude, width and phase are changing chaotically in time.\nFor an even greater h (and the same, fixed, \u03b3) the soliton breaks up and decays to zero\nwhereas increasing the driver's strength still further, a spatio-temporal chaotic state sets in.\nOn the other hand, if \u03b3 is large, the bifurcations of the soliton's period and its breakup are\nnot observed; instead, as h is increased for this \u03b3, the periodically oscillating soliton yields\ndirectly to the spatio-temporal chaos.\nSome insight into the mechanism controlling the soliton's transformations was gained in\nRef.[18] where a reduced amplitude equation was derived for the perturbation of the stationary soliton. Its analysis demonstrated that the emission of radiation waves plays a major\nrole in the soliton's dynamics. In particular, the soliton-radiation interaction accounts for\nthe stable periodic oscillations of the damped soliton (\u03b3 6= 0) and for the absence of the\nperiodicity in the undamped situation, \u03b3 = 0. However, the analysis of [18] was confined\nto a neighbourhood of the instability threshold h = hc (\u03b3) and hence the reduced amplitude equation could not reproduce the entire complexity in the soliton's dynamics which is\nobserved in numerical simulations with larger h [17].\nIn the present work we study the soliton-radiation interaction from a different perspective. Our decomposition of the phase space into soliton and radiation modes will be based\nnot on the linearisation about the stationary soliton in the \"q-space\" (which was the approach of Ref. [18]), but on the analysis of the spectral data of the Riemann-Hilbert problem\nassociated with the unperturbed NLS equation. This will allow us to examine the role of\nthe soliton-radiation coupling for arbitrary h and \u03b3, and not just in the neighbourhood of\nthe instability onset.\n\n\fThere is a number of perturbation schemes available in literature which exploit the\nproximity of the perturbed NLS (1) to the completely integrable case of the \"pure\" NLS,\neq.(1) with R = 0. (See [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] and a review [32]). Solutions\nof equation (1) have their images in the space of spectral data for any R, of course, but\nthis is of little use in the general case. The difficulty here is that the evolution equations\nfor the spectral data involve the associated eigenfunctions (or, equivalently, solutions of\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem). In order to obtain a closed system of equations for the\nspectral data, one assumes that R is small in some sense and expands the spectral data and\neigenfunctions in powers of the small parameter [24, 25]. In the adiabatic approximation,\nfor example, one first derives equations of the (slow) evolution of the soliton's parameters\n(ignoring the radiation completely) and then calculates the spectral density of the radiation\nemitted by this soliton [25, 26, 32]. The back-reaction of the radiation on the soliton is\nnot taken into account in this approach, therefore. The adiabatic approximation is capable\nof capturing some basic essentials of the soliton's dynamics, such as the phase-locking of\nthe soliton to the periodic driver (see e.g. [26]) or stability against perturbations of its\nparameters [25], and is usually sufficient for very small right-hand sides in (1). (See [32] for\ndetails.) However, it becomes inadequate for somewhat larger R, where the back-reaction\nof the emitted radiation on the soliton cannot be disregarded [28, 29, 33]. (For example, the\nadiabatic approximation does not capture the oscillatory instability of the parametrically\ndriven soliton which sets in for \u03b3 = 0 and h as small as 0.064 [13].)\nAn attempt to go beyond the adiabatic approximation and consider the radiation degrees of freedom on equal footing with those of the soliton was made by the authors of\nRef. [33] whose finite-dimensional reduction included the complex amplitude of the k = 0radiation. However, their derivation was not entirely self-consistent; in particular, their\napproach produced an equation for the radiation part of the spectral data which did not\ncontain a damping term. To reconcile conclusions of their finite-dimensional analysis with\ndirect numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation, the authors had to add\nthe damping in an ad hoc way. The amplitude of the radiation wave also remained undefined\nand had to be chosen so as to match the numerics [33].\nSimilarly to Ref. [33], the purpose of the present work is to study the effect of the\nsoliton-radiation coupling on the internal dynamics of the damped-driven soliton. However,\nunlike the analysis of Ref. [33] and perturbation schemes appeared elsewhere, our approach\nis not using the assumption of the smallness of R. Instead, we will exploit the fact that\nthe stationary soliton of equation (1)-(2) with R =\n6 0 coincides - up to a simple phase\ntransformation - with the soliton solution of equation (1) with R = 0. Consequently,\nthe stationary soliton of the parametrically driven damped NLS with arbitrarily large h\nand \u03b3 can be associated with a stationary zero of the Riemann-Hilbert problem underlying\nthe \"pure\", integrable, NLS equation. This observation allows to choose a different small\nparameter; instead of the smallness of h and \u03b3 we will be utilising the proximity of the\nsolution in question to the stationary soliton of the perturbed equation. (Another assumption\nthat we are going to make, following [33], is that the radiation is linear , i.e. it couples to the\nnonlinearly evolving soliton but does not interact with itself.) Using this small parameter we\nwill be able to obtain a closed system of equations describing, approximately, the evolution\nof the spectral data.\n\n\fSome analytical insights can be gained already from the linearisation of this system\n(about the zero of the Riemann-Hilbert problem corresponding to a single soliton). We will\nshow that the linearisation explains the origin of the oscillatory instability which serves as\na starting point of the sequence of secondary bifurcations and leads to the emergence of\nthe increasing complexity in the soliton's dynamics. (So far, the oscillatory instability and\nrelated Hopf bifurcation remained just facts of numerical analysis [13],[18].) It also indicates\nthat the soliton interacts most intensively with radiation waves near the lower boundary\nof their spectrum (where k = 0). This seems to be in agreement with earlier suggestions\n- made for a closely related externally driven NLS - that keeping just the k = 0 mode\nis sufficient to capture the basic features of the partial differential equation [33, 34, 35].\nAccordingly, we focus our subsequent efforts on the verification of this hypothesis. Namely,\nwe explore the effect of the coupling to the k = 0 radiation on the nonlinear dynamics of\nthe soliton. Keeping only infinitely long waves allows to obtain a four-dimensional system\nfor the soliton phase and the complex amplitude of the radiation. Results of the analysis of\nthis system are then compared to the phenomenology of the parametrically driven soliton\nreported in literature. We will show that taking the k = 0 radiation into account can explain\nsome dynamical effects, most notably the occurrence of the soliton's breakup and decay to\nzero. We will also identify aspects of the behaviour that cannot be attributed just to the\ncoupling of the soliton to the long-wavelength radiation and therefore require invoking other\ndegrees of freedom. These aspects will include, in particular, the shape of the instability\ndomain on the (h, \u03b3)-plane and the route to the (temporal) chaos.\nThe paper is organised as follows. The next section contains a brief summary of the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem and the perturbation theory based upon it. Section 3 discusses\nthe adiabatic approximation and its shortcomings. In section 4 we linearise the evolution\nequations for the spectral data, while the nonlinear four-dimensional system for the soliton's\nparameters and the complex amplitude of the k = 0 radiation is derived in section 5.\nNumerical simulations of this system are reported in section 6. The last section (section 7)\ncontains conclusions of our analysis.\n\n2\n\nInverse Spectral Transfrom for the \"pure\" and perturbed NLS equation\n\nIn this section we review the main points of the modern version of the Inverse Scattering\nTransform, known as the method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, for the NLS equation.\nAfter that we outline the basic principles of the Inverse Scattering-based perturbation theory,\nin its particular Riemann-Hilbert formulation.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Riemann-Hilbert problem\n\nThe applicability of the Inverse Scattering Transform to the unperturbed NLS equation (eq.\n(1) with R = 0) is due to the fact that the NLS serves as the compatibility condition for\nthe following system of two linear equations for the matrix-valued function \u03a8(x, t; \u03b6):\n\u2202x \u03a8 = i\u03b6[\u03c33 , \u03a8] + iQ\u03a8,\n\n(3)\n\n\f\u0001\n\u2202t \u03a8 = \u22122i\u03b6 2 [\u03c33 , \u03a8] \u2212 2i\u03b6Q + \u03c33 Qx \u2212 iQ2 \u03c33 \u03a8,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the potential matrix\n\nQ=\n\n\u0012\n\n0 q\nq\u2217 0\n\n\u0013\n\n;\n\nq = q(x, t) is a solution of the unperturbed NLS and \u03c33 is the Pauli matrix [19]. Knowing\n\u03a8, the potential Q can be recovered from the asymptotic expansion of \u03a8(\u03b6) as \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e:\n\u03a8(\u03b6) = I + \u03a8(1) \u03b6 \u22121 + . . . ,\n\nQ = [\u03a8(1) , \u03c33 ],\n\n(5)\n\nwhereas \u03a8 is found via the analytic factorisation in the complex \u03b6-plane. The factorisation\nproblem is known as the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem; the interested reader may consult\nRefs. [20, 21, 22, 23] for the full account of this technique while here we only give a brief\nsummary.\nFirst one defines the Jost solutions of equation (3) by their asymptotic behaviour as\nx \u2192 \u00b1\u221e: J\u00b1 \u2192 I. Then the matrix-valued function\n\u0001\n\u03a8+ (\u03b6) = (J+ )*1 (\u03b6) (J\u2212 )*2 (\u03b6)\n(6)\n\nis a solution to (3)-(4) holomorphic in the upper half of the complex \u03b6-plane (Im\u03b6 \u2265 0). In\n(6), (J\u00b1 )*l stands for the l-th column of J\u00b1 . Noting that the linear problem (3)-(4) admits\nan involution \u03a8\u2020 (\u03b6) = \u03a8\u22121 (\u03b6 \u2217), we introduce a matrix function holomorphic in the lower\nhalf-plane:\n\u0001T\n\u2020\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2217\n\u03a8\u22121\n,\n(7)\n\u2212 (\u03b6) = \u03a8+ (\u03b6 ) = (J+ )1* (\u03b6), (J\u2212 )2* (\u03b6)\nwhere (J\u00b1 \u22121 )l* denotes the l-th row of the matrix J\u00b1 \u22121 and T indicates transposition. The\nfunctions \u03a8+ (\u03b6) and \u03a8\u2212 (\u03b6), solutions to equation (3), can be expressed through the Jost\nsolutions and the elements of the scattering matrix, defined as\nS = e\u2212i\u03b6x\u03c33 J+\u22121 J\u2212 ei\u03b6x\u03c33 .\n\n(8)\n\nIntroducing the upper and lower-triangular matrices S\u00b1 , satisfying the equation S+ = SS\u2212 ,\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u22121\n\u0013\n1 S12\n(S )11 0\nS+ =\n, S\u2212 =\n,\n(9)\n0 S22\n(S \u22121 )21 1\nwe have\n\n\u03a8+ = J+ ei\u03b6x\u03c33 S+ e\u2212i\u03b6x\u03c33 ,\n\ni\u03b6x\u03c33 \u2020 \u2212i\u03b6x\u03c33 \u22121\n\u03a8\u22121\nS+ e\nJ+ .\n\u2212 = e\n\n(10)\n\nThis leads to the Riemann-Hilbert problem of finding the matrix-valued functions \u03a8+ (\u03b6)\nand \u03a8\u22121\n\u2212 (\u03b6), holomorphic in the upper and lower half-plane of \u03b6, respectively, and satisfying\ni\u03b6x\u03c33\n\u03a8\u22121\nGe\u2212i\u03b6x\u03c33 ,\n\u2212 \u03a8+ = e\n\non the real line [21].

We have\nGt = \u22122i\u03b6 2 [\u03c33 , G], hence gt = \u22124i\u03b6 2 g.\nIf the det \u03a8+ (\u03b6) has zeros in its analyticity domain, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is said\nto be singular (or with zeros). Owing to the involution, zeros of det \u03a8\u22121\n\u2212 (\u03b6) are complex\nconjugates of those of det \u03a8+ (\u03b6). The solution to the Riemann-Hilbert problem with zeros\ncan be written as\n(12)\n\u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b6) = \u03a80\u00b1 (\u03b6)\u0393(\u03b6),\nwhere det \u03a80\u00b1 (\u03b6) 6= 0 and the rational matrix function \u0393(\u03b6) (the \"dressing matrix\") has\nzeros of det \u03a8+ (\u03b6) and poles at the zeros of det \u03a8\u22121\n\u2212 (\u03b6). In the case of N simple zeros \u03b6j ,\nj = 1, . . . , N (i.e. det \u03a8+ (\u03b6) = O(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6j ) as \u03b6 \u2192 \u03b6j ), the dressing matrix has the following\nstructure (see also [21]):\nN\nX\n| pj i(D \u22121 )jl hpl |\n,\n(13)\n\u0393(\u03b6) = I \u2212\n\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6l\u2217\nj,l=1\n\n(\u03b6n \u2212 \u03b6l\u2217 )\u22121 hpl\n\nwhere Dln =\n| pn i and hpl | pn i = (p\u2217l )1 (pn )1 + (p\u2217l )2 (pn )2 .

The solution to the regular Riemann-Hilbert problem is unique\ndue to the normalisation condition at infinity.\nThe spectral data defining a unique solution to the Riemann-Hilbert problem consists of\ntwo parts: the discrete set of \u03b6j and |pj i (j = 1, ..., N) and the continuous data g(\u03b6) = G12 (\u03b6).\nThe pure soliton solutions arise from the Riemann-Hilbert problem with zeros provided\ng(\u03b6) = 0, i.e., \u03a80\u00b1 (\u03b6) = I.\nTo derive the coordinate dependence of the discrete data we note that det \u03a8\u00b1 (\u03b6) is\nt-independent, hence (\u03b6j )t = 0. The coordinate dependence of | pj i is obtained by the\ndifferentiation of the first relation in (14) and using equations (3), (4) and (14):\n| pj ix = i\u03b6j \u03c33 | pj i,\n\n| pj it = \u22122i\u03b6j2 \u03c33 | pj i.\n\nHence\n(0)\n\n| pj i = exp(fj \u03c33 ) | pj i =\n\nexp(aj + i\u03b8j + fj )\ne\u2212fj\n(0)\n\n(16)\n!\n\n,\n\n(17)\n(0)\n\nwhere fj = i\u03b6j x \u2212 2i\u03b6j2 t and we have defined exp(aj + i\u03b8j ) = (pj )1 /(pj )2 , with aj and \u03b8j\nreal constants.\nIn what follows we will need the one-soliton dressing matrix.

Here our analysis follows the lines of Refs. [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31].\nTo distinguish between the integrable and perturbation-induced t-dependence, we use the\n\"variational derivative\" notation.

The evolution functional \u03a0(x, \u03b6) is meromorphic in the upper half-plane of \u03b6 and\nhas simple poles at zeros of det \u03a8+ (\u03b6) (which are assumed to be simple). The r.h.s. of (24)\ndescribes the perturbation-induced evolution of \u03a8+ and should be added to the r.h.s. of (4).\nIn view of the involution \u03a8\u2020 (\u03b6) = \u03a8\u22121 (\u03b6 \u2217 ), the evolution of \u03a8\u22121\n\u2212 is given by the Hermitian\nconjugate of equation (24):\n\u03b4\u03a8\u22121\n\u2212 (x, \u03b6)\n= ei\u03b6x\u03c33 \u03a0\u2020 (x, \u03b6 \u2217 )e\u2212i\u03b6x\u03c33 \u03a8\u22121\n\u2212 (x, \u03b6).\n\u03b4t\n\n(25)\n\nRelations (24)-(25) yield equations for the perturbation-induced evolution of the complete set of the spectral data {g(\u03b6); \u03b6j , aj , \u03b8j (j = 1, . . . , N)}:\nd\u03b6j\n= \u2212res\u03a522 (\u03b6j ),\ndt\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZt\nd\n(reg)\n(reg)\n(aj + i\u03b8j ) = \u03a522 (\u03b6j ) \u2212 exp \uf8ed4i\ndt\u03b6j2 \u2212 aj \u2212 i\u03b8j \uf8f8 \u03a512 (\u03b6j ),\ndt\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\n0\n\ndg(\u03b6)\n= \u22124i\u03b6 2 g(\u03b6) + \u03a512 (\u03b6) + \u03a522 (\u03b6)g(\u03b6),\ndt\nwhere \u03a5(\u03b6) = \u03a5(\u2212\u221e, \u221e; \u03b6) and\n\b\n\u03a5(reg) (\u03b6j ) = lim \u03a5(\u03b6) \u2212 (\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6j )\u22121 res\u03a5(\u03b6j )\n\n(28)\n\n\u03b6\u2192\u03b6j\n\nis the regular part of \u03a5(\u03b6) at the pole \u03b6 = \u03b6j .

However, these\nequations can be simplified by expanding in powers of a suitably chosen small parameter.\nIn section 4 we will make a choice of the small parameter that will allow us to develop a\nrigorous approach to the soliton-radiation interaction. For completeness of the presentation,\nhowever, we consider the standard adiabatic approximation first.\n\n3\n\nAdiabatic approximation\n\nIn this section we summarise the main points of the adiabatic approach and establish their\nconnection to some facts about the parametrically driven, damped NLS equation, available\nin literature. Consider equation (1) with R as in (2), and assume that h and \u03b3 are small. In\n\n\fthe adiabatic approximation the soliton solution is assumed to be given simply by the unperturbed NLS soliton (21) with the parameters \u03be, \u03b7, a, and \u03b8 being slowly changing functions\nof time. We now derive and discuss the adiabatic equations for the soliton parameters.\nThe matrix \u03a5(\u03b6) \u2261 \u03a5(\u2212\u221e, \u221e; \u03b6), the key element of the perturbation theory defined in\n(23), can be easily computed for the NLS soliton with the t-dependent parameters.

This can\nbe presented in the following convenient form:\n\u03b7\u0307 = \u22122\u03b7(\u03b3 + h sin \u03a6),\n\u03a6\u0307 = 2\u03a90 \u2212 8\u03b7 2 \u2212 2h cos \u03a6,\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nwhere\n\u03a6/2 = \u03a90 t \u2212 \u03c60\nis the difference between the phase of the driver and the core phase of the soliton.\n\n(43)\n\n\fThese equations were first derived in [36] and [37] (within a different approach, though).\nThe two first-order equations (41)-(42) can be rewritten as a single second-order equation\nfor \u03a6:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03a6\u0308 + 2 2\u03b3 + h sin \u03a6 \u03a6\u0307 \u2212 8 \u03a90 \u2212 h cos \u03a6 \u03b3 + h sin \u03a6 = 0,\n(44)\n\nwhich in some situations is more amenable for analysis. Equations (41)-(42) have two fixed\npoints (\u03b7\u00b1 , \u03a6\u00b1 ) which correspond to stationary soliton solutions (21) with \u03b7 = \u03b7\u00b1 and\n\u03a6 = \u03a6\u00b1 . Here\n\u0010\u03b3 \u0011\n\u0010\u03b3 \u0011\np\n2\u03b7\u00b1 = \u03a90 \u00b1 H, \u03a6+ = \u2212\u03c0 + arcsin\n, \u03a6\u2212 = \u2212 arcsin\n(45)\nh\nh\n\nand\n\nH=\n\np\n\nh2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 .\n\nAlthough obtained in the adiabatic approximation, these two solitons turn out to be exact\nsolutions of the parametrically driven damped NLS [1, 13].\nLinearising equation (44) in the small perturbation \u03c6 = \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u00b1 , and making use of\nrelations\nh sin(\u03a6\u00b1 + \u03c6) = \u2212\u03b3 \u2213 H\u03c6 + O(\u03c62 ),\n\nh cos(\u03a6\u00b1 + \u03c6) = \u2213H + \u03b3\u03c6 + O(\u03c62 ),\n\nyields the equation of damped linear oscillator:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c6\u0308 + 2\u03b3 \u03c6\u0307 \u00b1 8H \u03a90 + H \u03c6 = 0.\n\n(46)\n\nFrom here one readily concludes [36, 37] that the q+ -soliton (i.e. the soliton (21) with \u03b7 = \u03b7+\nand \u03a6 = \u03a6+ ) is adiabatically\nstable and, when excited, exhibits decaying oscillations at the\np\nbare frequency \u03a9s = 8H(\u03a90 + H). The q\u2212 -soliton (for which \u03b7 = \u03b7\u2212 and \u03a6 = \u03a6\u2212 ) is\nadiabatically unstable, and this of course implies that it is unstable within the full partial\ndifferential equation. (This is corroborated by the stability analysis of the full equation, see\n[13].) For this reason we disregard the q\u2212 soliton in what follows and focus entirely on the\nq+ ; from now on the \"parametrically driven damped soliton\" will always mean the soliton\nq+ .\nIt is interesting to note that the adiabatic equations (41)-(42) have another solution that\nadmits a simple interpretation. It is given by \u03b7 = 0 and \u03a6\u0307 = 2(\u03a90 \u2212h cos \u03a6) and corresponds\nto the flat solution q = 0 of the full damped-driven NLS. It will reappear in our analysis of\nthe soliton-radiation interaction below.\nThe main shortcoming of the adiabatic approximation is in that it ignores the solitonradiation interaction. As a result, it is unable to reproduce many features of soliton's\ndynamics even for fairly small perturbations. In particular, the adiabatic approach does\nnot capture the oscillatory instability of the q+ soliton which sets in as the driving strength\nexceeds a certain - rather low - threshold [13]. (For example, for \u03b3 = 0 this threshold\nis at h = hc (0) = 0.064.) Neither is it capable of reproducing secondary bifurcations and\nchaotic dynamics of the soliton. In what follows we go beyond the adiabatic approximation\nand take the soliton-radiation coupling into account.\n\n\f4\n\nEvolution of the spectral data\n\n4.1\n\nThe essence of our approach\n\nAs we mentioned in section 2, the soliton of the unperturbed, \"pure\", NLS corresponds to\na single zero of the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with this equation. Our approach\nto the parametricaly driven, damped NLS (1)-(2) is based on the fact that it can be cast in\nthe form\niut + uxx + 2|u|2u = he2i\u03a9t u\u2217 \u2212 (H + i\u03b3)u,\n(47)\nwhere\nu(x, t) = eiHt q(x, t),\n\n(48)\n\nand \u03a9 = \u03a90 + H. The key property of the new formulation is that both the left and the\nright-hand side of equation (47) are equal to zero for u equal to\n\b 2\nexp 4i\u03b7+\nt \u2212 (i/2)\u03a6+\n,\n(49)\nu+ (x, t) = 2i\u03b7+\ncosh (2\u03b7+ x)\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a6+ and \u03b7+ are as in (45). (In particular, 2\u03b7+ = \u03a9.) Hence u+ coincides - exactly\n- with the soliton of the unperturbed NLS equation with a particular amplitude and phase\n(selected by the parameters of the perturbation). Therefore, this solution of the perturbed\nequation is also associated with a single zero of the Riemann-Hilbert problem underlying\nthe unperturbed, integrable, NLS. It is important to emphasise that this correspondence is\nvalid for arbitrarily large values of h and \u03b3 (where h only has to be greater than \u03b3 so that\nthe soliton (49), (45) exists).\nRescaling t, x, q, h and \u03b3 we can always arrange that \u03a90 = 1 in equation (2). Next, we\nhave already seen that the motionless soliton is a solution of the adiabatic equations. It is\nnot difficult to realise that, in our case, even when the radiations are taken into account,\nan initially quiescent soliton will remain nonpropagating at all times. This follows from\nthe evolution equations for the spectral data {\u03b7, \u03be, x0, \u03c60 ; g(\u03b6)} for the damped-driven NLS\n(1)-(2). These evolution equations, linearised in \u03c60 and g(\u03b6), can be easily shown to be\ncompatible with the constraint\nx0 = 0,\n\n\u03be = 0,\n\ng(\u2212\u03b6) = g(\u03b6).\n\n(50)\n\nConsequently, in this paper we confine ourselves to the internal dynamics of the nonpropagating soliton (placed at the origin for convenience) and its radiation. The corresponding\nsolution of equation (47) is given by an even function of x:\nu(x, t) = us (x, t) + ur (x, t),\n\n(51)\n\nwhere us (x, t) has the form of the motionless soliton of the \"pure\" NLS, located at the origin,\nwith the time-dependent amplitude and phase:\nus (x, t) = 2i\u03b7ei\u03c60 sechz.\n\n(52)\n\n\fHere \u03b7 = \u03b7(t), z = \u22122\u03b7(t)x, and \u03c60 is given by equation (34) where we only need to set\n\u03be = 0:\nZt\n\u03c60 (t) = \u03b8(t) + 4 \u03b7 2 dt.\n0\n\nEquivalently, the soliton can be written in the form\nexp {i\u03a9t \u2212 i\u03a6/2}\n,\nus (x, t) = 2i\u03b7\ncosh z\nwhere the variable \u03a6 is defined by\n\u03a6/2 = \u03a9t \u2212 \u03c60 .\n\n(53)\n\nThe definition (53) is equivalent to (43); in both cases \u03a6/2 is the difference between the\nphase of the driver and the core phase of the soliton. (Here we should alert the reader to\nthe fact that, since q and u are different by the factor (48), the core phases \u03c60 (t) in (53)\nand in (43) are different by Ht.)\nThe second term in (51) accounts for the radiation waves. As in Ref. [33], in our derivation of the evolution equations for the spectral data we will retain only terms linear in\nradiation. Hence it is sufficient to solve the linearised version of the regular RiemannHilbert problem (15) to obtain the radiation part of the solution (51). The linearisation of\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem produces the Plemelj jump problem:\n\u03a80+ \u2212 \u03a80\u2212 = \u0393ei\u03b6x\u03c33 Ge\u2212i\u03b6x\u03c33 \u0393\u22121 ,\n\nIm\u03b6 = 0.\n\n(54)\n\nTaking into account the normalisation condition \u03a80 \u2192 I as \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e, we obtain from (54):\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\u221e\ndl\n1\n0\ne2ilx g(l)\n\u0393\u22121 (l).\n(55)\n\u0393(l)\n\u03a80\u00b1 (\u03b6) = I +\ne\u22122ilx g \u2217 (l)\n0\n2\u03c0i\nl\u2212\u03b6\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(Here the sign + respectively \u2212 indicates that \u03b6 lies in the upper respectively lower halfplane.) The radiation part of the solution (51) is now given by equation (5):\nZ\u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nur = \u22122 lim \u03b6(\u03a80+ )12 =\nd\u03b6 \u039311 (\u0393\u22121 )22 e2i\u03b6x g + \u039312 (\u0393\u22121 )12 e\u22122i\u03b6x g \u2217 .\n(56)\n\u03b6\u2192\u221e\n\u03c0i\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFinally, substituting the one-soliton dressing matrix (18) into equation (56), introducing the\nnotation\n\u03b6\nk=\n(57)\n\u03b7\nand defining the radiation amplitude b(k) by\nb(k) = exp(\u2212i\u03c60 )g(\u03b7k),\nwe arrive at the formula for the linear radiation:\nZ\u221e\n\u0003\ndk \u0002\n\u03b7ei\u03c60\n2 \u2212ikz\n2 ikz \u2217\n(k\n\u2212\ni\ntanhz)\ne\nb(k)\n+\nsech\nze\nb\n(k)\nur (x, t) =\n\u03c0i\nk2 + 1\n\u2212\u221e\n\n- in exact agreement with the corresponding result in Ref. [25].\n\n(58)\n\n(59)\n\n\f4.2\n\nA closed system for the evolution of the spectral data\n\nSince the r.h.s. of the perturbed NLS (47) is linear in u, the decomposition of the solution\ninto the soliton and radiation parts, equation (51), induces the corresponding decomposition\nof the perturbation:\nR = R(us ) + R(ur ) \u2261 Rs + Rr .\nThe perturbation matrix (22) splits accordingly: R = Rs + Rr . Substituting for us and ur\nfrom (52) and (59), we get\n\u0001\nRs = (Rs )12 = he2i\u03a9t u\u2217s \u2212 (H + i\u03b3)us = \u2212iH + \u03b3 \u2212 ihei\u03a6 2\u03b7ei\u03c60 sechz\nand\n\nRr = (Rr )12 = he2i\u03a9t u\u2217r \u2212 (H + i\u03b3)ur ,\n\nrespectively.

(As we already\nmentioned, these conditions are compatible with the evolution equations for the spectral\ndata.) It is convenient to present the final result in terms of \u03a6; w = 8\u03b7 2 ; and the real and\nimaginary parts of the radiation amplitude b(k) = bR + ibI .

(On the contrary, writing \u1e03 would mean \u2202b/\u2202t + k\u0307\u2202b/\u2202k with k(t) as\nin (57), k = \u03b6/\u03b7(t).) We are using partials here for later computational convenience.\nIt is worth re-emphasising that equations (61)-(64) are valid for arbitrarily large h and\n\u03b3. The only approximation we made in their derivation, was to drop terms of order higher\nthan linear in b.\nLetting bR = bI = 0 reduces equations (61)-(62) to the adiabatic equations (41)-(42).\nLike the adiabatic equations, the system (61)-(64) has a fixed point w = 2\u03a9 = 2(1 + H),\n\u03a6 = \u03a6+ \u2261 \u2212\u03c0 + arcsin(\u03b3/h), bR = bI = 0, which corresponds to the soliton (49) of equation\n(47). Another meaningful solution arises by setting w = 0 and solving (61) for \u03a6(t); the bR\nand bI are then recovered from the nonhomogeneous linear system (63)-(64). We will return\nto (a descendant of) this solution in section 5.\n\n4.3\n\nLinearised evolution of the spectral data\n\nLinearising the system (61)-(64) about the above fixed point, one obtains four first-order\nlinear equations which are equivalent to a pair of second-order equations for \u03c6 \u2261 \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6+\nand \u03b2(k), where\n2 bI (k)\n\u03b2(k) \u2261 \u221a \u221a\n.\n(65)\n\u03c0 1 + k2\nThe second-order system has the form:\n\u221a\n\u03c6\u0308 + 2\u03b3 \u03c6\u0307 + 8H\u03a9\u03c6 = 2 \u03c0H\u03a9\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndk\n\n\u221a\n\n1+\n\nk2\n\nsech\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0k\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b2(k),\n(66)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b2\u0308 + 2\u03b3 \u03b2\u0307 + \u011c\u03b2 = \u22122 \u03c0H\u03a9 1 + k 2 sech\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0k\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c6.\n\nHere we have made use of relations (46) and introduced a real symmetric operator \u011c:\nwhere\nB\u0302f (k) \u2261\n\n\u011c = (1 + \u03a9k 2 )2 \u2212 H 2 + 2H\u03a9B\u0302,\n\n(67)\n\nZ\u221e\n\n(68)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndl\n\nf (l)\n(k \u2212 l)(lk \u2212 1)\np\n.\nsinh[\u03c0(k \u2212 l)/2] (1 + k 2 )(1 + l2 )\n\nIt is worth noting here that since the equation for \u03c6 is not uncoupled from the equation for\n\u03b2, the \u03c6 and \u03b2(k) do not represent the normal modes of the soliton-radiation system. This\n\n\fis of course a consequence of the nonintegrability of the perturbed nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation.\nThe system (66) is exactly equivalent to the NLS (47) linearised about the soliton (49).\nIn particular, one can readily check that for H \u2192 0, the oscillation frequencies of (66)\nreproduce the asymptotic expansions obtained in [13]. Indeed, letting \u03c6(t) = e(i\u03c9\u2212\u03b3)t \u03c7 and\n\u03b2(k; t) = e(i\u03c9\u2212\u03b3)t \u03b1(k) transforms (66) to an eigenvalue problem\n\u221a\n\n8H\u03a9\u03c7 \u2212 2 \u03c0H\u03a9\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndk\n\n\u221a\n\n1+\n\nk2\n\nsech\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0k\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1(k) = \u03bc\u03c7,\n(69)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 \u03c0H\u03a9 1 + k 2 sech\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0k\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c7 + \u011c\u03b1(k) = \u03bc\u03b1(k),\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u03c9 2 + \u03b3 2 . (Below, we normalise the eigenvector {\u03c7, \u03b1(k)} by setting \u03c7 = 1.)\nA simple perturbation analysis shows that for small H there is an eigenvalue \u03bc = 8H[1 +\n2\n(\u03c0 /6 \u2212 1)H] + O(H 3). Another discrete eigenvalue detaches from the boundary of the\ncontinuous spectrum (which extends from \u03bc = 1 \u2212 H 2 to infinity): \u03bc = 1 \u2212 9H 2 + O(H 3).\nBoth eigenvalues coincide, to within terms O(H 3 ), with the corresponding expressions for\nthe eigenfrequencies in the space of fields u(x, t) [13].\nIn fact the eigenvalue problem (69) is amenable to analytical study not only in the H \u2192 0\nlimit. (This is the principal advantage of the analysis in the space of scattering data over\nthe linearisation in the u(x, t)-space where one has to resort to the help of computer.)

This is a monotonically growing function for all \u03bc except points\n\u03bc = En where it drops from plus to minus infinity. For \u03bc < E1 the function g(\u03bc) is strictly\npositive and decays to zero as \u03bc \u2192 \u2212\u221e. (See Fig.1). Roots of equation (78) give discrete\nfrequencies of the system (66), while the spectrum of continuous frequencies extends from\n\u03bc = 1 \u2212 H 2 = 1 + \u03b3 2 \u2212 h2 , to infinity.\n\n\f\u03bc3\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nE1\n\n1\u2212H2\n\nFigure 1: The graphical solution of the characteristic equation (78). The solid straight line\ndepicts the function y(\u03bc) = \u03bc \u2212 8H\u03a9 and the two solid curves intersecting it are branches of\ny = g(\u03bc).\nBefore discussing the roots, we would like to note that the characteristic equation (78)\ndoes\np not contain \u03b3 explicitly. Having solved it for \u03bc we can recover \u03c9 for any \u03b3: \u03c9 =\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 2 . This invariance of the eigenvalue problem in the space of scattering data is\nan exact equivalent of the invariance of the linearised eigenvalue problem in the space of\nsolutions to the NLS equation [13].\nThe graph Fig.1 shows that the function y = g(\u03bc) and the straight line y = \u03bc\u22128H\u03a9 have\nat least three intersections, \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 and \u03bc3 such that \u03bc1 \u2264 \u03bc2 < E1 < \u03bc3 . As H grows, the\nstraight line is shifted down and the function g(\u03bc, H) also changes. In particular, for small\nH the coefficients \u03ba2 increase in proportion to H 2 while the eigenvalue E1 decreases and the\nedge of the continuous spectrum, 1 \u2212 H 2, also moves to the left. Hence for any fixed \u03bc < E1\nthe corresponding g(\u03bc) grows. As a result, the intersection points \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 approach each\nother, then merge for some critical value H = Hcr and emerge into the complex plane. As\nH is increased past Hcr , the imaginary parts of \u03bc2 = \u03bc\u22171 grow and eventually the positive\nimaginary part becomes equal to \u03b3. This is the point of the Hopf bifurcation; for H above\nthis point the soliton (49) is unstable.\nConclusions of the above graphical analysis are in exact agreement with the behaviour of\neigenvalues of the linearisation of equation (47) observed numerically [13]. A new feature is\nthe appearance of another discrete eigenvalue, \u03bc3 , which was not detected in the numerical\ncomputations of [13, 18]. One reason for this omission could be that the separation of \u03bc3\nfrom the continuum remains exponentially small for small H. Indeed,\nfor H \u2192 0 equation\n\u221a\n3/2\n5/2\n2\n(77) infers that \u03ba(E1 ) = 4\u03c0H + O(H ) and \u03ba(1 \u2212 H ) = 8\u03c0H + O(H 2). Assuming\n\u03bc3 = 1\u2212H 2 \u2212\u03b4\u03bc, where \u03b4\u03bc/H 2 \u2192 0 as H \u2192 0, equation (79) gives g(\u03bc, H) = \u22128\u03c0H 2 ln \u03b4\u03bc\u2212\n\n\f2\u03c0 2 H + O(H 2). Substituting into (78), we obtain for the separation \u03b4\u03bc:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n2\u03c0 2 \u2212 8 1\n1 1\n\u2212\n+C\nas H \u2192 0,\n\u03b4\u03bc = exp \u2212\n8\u03c0 H 2\n8\u03c0 H\n\n(80)\n\nwhere C = C(H) remains bounded as H \u2192 0. As H grows, the frequency \u03bc3 remains real\nand therefore does not give rise to any instabilities of the stationary solitons. However it\nmay play a role in the resonance phenomena involving oscillating solitons.\nWe conclude this section with two remarks. First, our linearisation in the space of\nscattering data allows to explain the origin of the oscillatory instability of the soliton. When\nH is very small, the soliton oscillations are virtually uncoupled from the radiation waves.\nThe former have their frequency close to \u03bc = 0 while the radiations have continuum of\nfrequencies occupying the semiaxis \u03bc \u2265 1. As H is increased, the coupling grows, and as\na result of that the soliton's frequency is dragged closer to the continuum while another\nlocal mode is pulled out of the radiation spectrum. Finally, the two modes merge and the\nresonance occurs.\nSecond, we observe that as k grows, the right-hand side of the bottom equation in (66)\ndecreases rapidly. We also notice that only \u03b2(k) with small k contribute significantly to\nthe right-hand side of the top equation. Consequently, only long radiation waves couple to\nthe soliton. In the next section we study the effect of the k = 0 radiation on the soliton's\nnonlinear dynamics.\n\n5\n\nThe long-wavelength limit\n\nIn order to study the soliton-radiation interaction at the long-wavelength limit, we write\nthe spectral density b(k) in the form b(k) = b\u01eb (k) = \u01eb\u22121 b\u0303(k/\u01eb), where b\u0303 is an even function\nof its argument; integrate equations (63) and (64) over a small range of k \u2208 [\u2212\u03b4k, \u03b4k] and\nthen send \u01eb \u2192 0 in (61)-(64). This allows to derive a finite-dimensional system without\nany ad-hoc cut-off parameters (cf. [33, 38, 34]). The resulting four-dimensional system\ncomprises equations for the amplitude and phase of the soliton, and the complex amplitude\nof the k = 0 radiation:\nZ\u03b4k\n\u03c1 + i\u03c3 = lim\ndk b\u01eb (k).\n\u01eb\u21920\n\u2212\u03b4k\n\nSkipping some lengthy but elementary calculations, we produce only the final result:\n\u03a6\u0307 = 2(1 \u2212 h cos \u03a6) \u2212 w,\n\n(81)\n\nn\no\n\u1e87 = \u2212 (\u03b3 + h sin \u03a6)(4 \u2212 \u03c1) \u2212 2\u03c3h cos \u03a6 w,\nnw\no\n\u03c1\u0307 =\n\u2212 cH + (c + 2)h cos \u03a6 \u03c3 \u2212 (\u03b3 + h sin \u03a6)(4 \u2212 \u03c1),\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nw H 1\n\u03c3\u0307 = \u2212 +\n+ h cos \u03a6 \u03c1 + (\u03b3 + 3h sin \u03a6)\u03c3.\n2\n3\n3\n\n(82)\n(83)\n(84)\n\n\fHere w = 8\u03b7 2 and c = 4 ln 2 \u2212 2 \u2248 0.77.\nBelow we will compare conclusions based on the analysis of the four-dimensional system\n(81)-(84) with solutions of the full nonreduced NLS equation. To facilitate the comparison\nwith results available in literature, we take the damped-driven NLS in autonomous form:\ni\u03c8t + \u03c8xx + 2|\u03c8|2 \u03c8 = (1 \u2212 i\u03b3)\u03c8 + h\u03c8 \u2217 .\n\n(85)\n\nHere \u03c8 is related to a solution of equation (47) by a simple phase transformation: \u03c8(x, t) =\n\u2212 exp(\u2212i\u03a9t)u(x, t). The value of the field (which is a sum of the soliton and radiation) at\nthe centre of the soliton, i.e., at x = 0, can be expressed through the variables of the reduced\nsystem. Using (51) and (59) we obtain in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\ni\ni\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c1\n= 2i\u03b7 exp i\u03a9t \u2212 \u03a6\nu(x, t)\n,\n1+\n2\n2\u03c0\nx=0\nand hence the value of the solution of the NLS (85) at the point x = 0 is given by\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\u001b r \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a6+\u03c0\ni\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c1\nw\n= exp \u2212i\n\u03c8(x, t)\n1+\n\u2261 \u03c80 (t).\n2\n2\n2\u03c0\nx=0\n\n(86)\n\nThe finite-dimensional system has two exact solutions.

The second solution arises by\nletting w = 0, with \u03a6 determined from the equation (81), and \u03c1 and \u03c3 defined by the linear\nsystem (83) - (84). Choosing the constant of integration so that \u03a6(0) = 0, we obtain\n(\u0012\n)\n\u00131\n\u221a\n1\u2212h 2\n\u03a6(t) = 2 arctan\n(88)\ntan( 1 \u2212 h2 t) mod (2\u03c0).\n1+h\nSubstituting this into equations (83) and (84), the system for \u03c1 and \u03c3 becomes\n\u03c1\u0307 = (\u03b3 + hd1 )(\u03c1 \u2212 4) + (4 ln 2 hd2 \u2212 c)\u03c3,\n(89)\n1\n\u03c3\u0307 = (\u03b3 + 3hd1 )\u03c3 + (H \u2212 hd2 )\u03c1,\n3\nwhere\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 h2 sin(2 1 \u2212 h2 t)\n\u221a\nd1 = sin \u03a6(t) =\n,\n1 + h cos(2 1 \u2212 h2 t)\n\n\u221a\nh + cos(2 1 \u2212 h2 t)\n\u221a\nd2 = cos \u03a6(t) =\n.\n1 + h cos(2 1 \u2212 h2 t)\n\nIn view of equations (52) and (59), w = 0 amounts to \u03c8(x, t) = u(x, t) = 0 and hence\nthe above w = 0 solution corresponds to the flat zero solution of the full nonreduced NLS\nequation (85). This fact is quite remarkable. Indeed, although the system (81)-(84) was\nderived under the assumption of the proximity to the (damped driven) soliton, it does\n\n\f12\n10\n\n(a)\n\n8\n6\n\nw\n\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n294\n\n250\n\n294\n\n22\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c1\n\n10\n\n\u03c3\n\n0\n\u221210\n\u221222\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nt\nFigure 2: A numerical evolution of w, \u03c1, and \u03c3: an attraction to the w = 0 solution and an\nexplosive instability of the latter due to the exponential growth of \u03c1 and \u03c3.\n\n\fpossess the flat solution which cannot be regarded as the soliton's small perturbation. As\nin the full partial differential equation (85), where the unstable soliton can decay to the flat\nattractor, finite-dimensional trajectories starting near the unstable fixed point (87) can be\nattracted to the w = 0 solution. An example of such evolution, obtained numerically, is\npresented in Fig. 2, for t \u2208 [0, 250].\nIt is important to note here that for \u03b3 > 0, solutions to the linear system (89) are\nexponentially growing functions (see Fig. 2(b)). This is not in disagreement with the fact\nthat the corresponding \u03c8(x, t) is zero for all x and t. Indeed, the total amplitude of the\nlong-wavelength radiation includes a factor \u03b7 (see e.g. (59) or (86).) Therefore, if w = \u03b7 = 0,\nthe total amplitude is zero no matter what \u03c1 and \u03c3 are equal to.\nThe fact that \u03c1 and \u03c3 are exponentially growing functions, gives rise to an instability of\nthe w = 0 solution of the system (81)-(84). Indeed, the multiplier\nr(t) = \u2212 {(\u03b3 + h sin \u03a6)(4 \u2212 \u03c1) \u2212 2\u03c3h cos \u03a6}\nin the right-hand side of (82), may assume large positive values. (For example, each time\nsin \u03a6 goes through 1, r(t) becomes equal to approximately (\u03b3 + h)\u03c1.) This means that for\nw <\u223c 1 we have two different time scales in the system: the variables \u03a6, \u03c1 and \u03c3 do not\nchange appreciably on intervals \u2206t <\u223c 1 and can be considered constant, while w grows with\nthe exponential growth rate r \u226b 1. Consequently, if w is assigned a small but nonzero\nvalue at the moment of time when r(t) is large, it will quickly (within \u2206t \u223c r\u22121 ) grow to\nvalues of order r. This is indeed observed in simulations, see Fig.2 for t > 250. However,\nthe instability of the w = 0 solution is spurious - in the sense that it does not mirror any\ngenuine instabilities of the zero solution in the full NLS equation.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nReduced finite-dimensional dynamics\nOnset of instability\n\nLinearising the system (81)-(84) about the fixed point (87) and using (46), we obtain\n\u03c6\u0308 + 2\u03b3 \u03c6\u0307 + 8H(1 + H)\u03c6 = 4H(1 + H)\u03c3,\n\n(90)\n\n\u03c3\u0308 + 2\u03b3 \u03c3\u0307 + (1 + H)[1 \u2212 (2c + 1)H]\u03c3 = \u22124H(1 + H)\u03c6.\n\n(91)\n\n\u03c9 4 \u2212 (\u03a92s + \u03a92r \u2212 2\u03b3 2 )\u03c9 2 + (\u03a92s \u2212 \u03b3 2 )(\u03a92r \u2212 \u03b3 2 ) + 16H 2 (1 + H)2 = 0.\n\n(92)\n\nHere \u03c6 is the perturbation of the soliton's phase, defined as \u03c6 = \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6+ . Letting \u03c6(t) = \u03c7e\u03bbt\nand \u03c3(t) = \u03c30 e\u03bbt , where \u03bb = \u2212\u03b3 + i\u03c9, we obtain the characteristic equation for complex \u03c9:\n\nHere\n\u03a92s = 8H(1 + H),\n\n\u03a92r = (1 + H)[1 \u2212 (2c + 1)H].\n\nLike the eigenvalue problem (74)-(76) for the full set of spectral data (and like the\neigenvalue problem for the underlying partial differential equation [13]), the characteristic\n\n\fequation (92) can be conveniently reformulated in terms of the self-similar variable \u03bc =\n\u03b3 2 + \u03c92:\n\u03bc2 \u2212 p\u03bc + q = 0,\n(93)\nwhere\np = p(H) = \u03a92s + \u03a92r ,\n\nq = q(H) = \u03a92s \u03a92r + 16H 2(1 + H)2 .\n\nThe fact that the reduced system (81)-(84) inherits the self-similarity of the parent PDE,\ndeserves to be specially emphasised. It implies that the reduction procedure based on\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem - unlike the variational reductions [42, 43] - preserves the\nstructure of the infinite-dimensional phase space.\nThe fixed point is unstable when Re\u03bb > 0. In terms of \u03bc, this condition translates into\n[Im\u03bc(H)]2\n\u2265 \u03b3 2.\n4Re\u03bc(H)\n\n(94)\n\nThe discriminant of (93) is\nD(H) = (H1 H2 )\u22121 (1 + H)2 (H \u2212 H1 )(H \u2212 H2 ),\nwhere H1 = (8 ln 2 + 13)\u22121 \u2248 0.054 and H2 = (8 ln 2 \u2212 3)\u22121 \u2248 0.39. Between H1 and H2\nthe quadratic (93) has a pair of complex-conjugate roots while outside this interval both\nroots are real and nonnegative (Fig. 3). Consequently, the inequality (94) can only hold for\nH1 \u2264 H \u2264 H2 . For H within this interval the inequality (94) amounts to\n8\u03b3 2 \u2264 \u2212D(H)/p(H).\n\n(95)\n\nFor small \u03b3 the cubic equation D(H)/p(H) = \u22128\u03b3 2 has one negative and two positive roots\nwhich we denote H1 (\u03b3) and H2 (\u03b3), 0 < H1 (\u03b3) < H2p\n(\u03b3). (Note that H1 (0) = H1 and\nH2 (0) = H2 ; hence the notation.) Recalling that H = h2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 , the instability inequality\n(95) can be rewritten as\nq\nq\n2\n2\nH1 (\u03b3) + \u03b3 \u2264 h \u2264 H22 (\u03b3) + \u03b3 2 .\n(96)\n\nAs \u03b3 is increased, the positive roots H1 (\u03b3) and H2 (\u03b3) merge and become complex. For\ngreater \u03b3 the inequality (94)-(95) cannot be satisfied by any h.\nEquation (96) gives an explicit form\n(Fig.4).\npof the instability region on the (h, \u03b3)-plane\np\n2\n2\n2\nAs h is increased past the value h = H1 + \u03b3 (or decreased below h = H2 + \u03b3 2 ), the\nfixed point becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation.\nThe instability setting in for H > H1 (\u03b3) corresponds to the Hopf instability of the\nsoliton in the full damped-driven\nNLS equation. Note however that the finite-dimensional\np\n2\ninstability threshold h = H1 (\u03b3) + \u03b3 2 is somewhat lower than the instability threshold in\nthe partial differential equation (which is alsopshown in Fig. 4).

Also shown is the straight line h = \u03b3, the boundary of the existence domain of both the\nsoliton and the fixed point (87).\nexpected to provide a good approximation to the infinite-dimensional dynamics for h greater\nthan approximately 0.4.\nIn order to find attractors in the region inside the parabola (96), where the fixed point\nis unstable, we performed a series of numerical simulations of equations (81)-(84). Here our\nstrategy was similar to that used in the simulations of the full nonreduced NLS equation [17];\nthat is, we varied h for a fixed value of \u03b3. We also adopted the same strategy with regard to\nthe choice of the initial conditions. Our simulations always started with the (unstable) fixed\npoint perturbed by values of order 10\u221214 which is several orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe local discretisation error of the Runge-Kutta approximation. (For some values of h and\n\u03b3 the final state of the system was extremely sensitive to tiny changes of this perturbation.)\n\n6.2\n\nFinite-dimensional attractors; \u03b3 6= 0\n\nAs h is increased for a fixed nonzero \u03b3 (with\np \u03b3 \u2264 0.31), a limit cycle is born supercritically\nat the point of the Hopf bifurcation, h = H12 (\u03b3) + \u03b3 2 . This is in exact agreement with the\nfull partial differential equation. The subsequent bifurcation diagram depends on the value\nof \u03b3.\nFor \u03b3 greater than\np approximately 0.2, the stable limit cycle persists as h is increased all\nthe way up to h = H22 (\u03b3) + \u03b3 2 where it shrinks back to the fixed point. On the contrary, if\nwe increase h for a smaller \u03b3,p0.12 < \u03b3 \u2264 0.20, the limit cycle looses its stability at a certain\nvalue h = hz (where hz < H22 + \u03b3 2 .) For h above hz , the finite-dimensional trajectory\n\n\femanating from any initial condition, quickly settles to the w = 0 solution corresponding\nto the zero attractor of the full nonreduced NLS. (This is illustrated by Fig.2 and, for a\ndifferent \u03b3, Fig.5(b).) Increasing h still further, the w = 0 solution persists as the only\nattractor over a sizeable range of h values - until a stable limit cycle reappears. This range\nbecomes wider for smaller values of \u03b3.\nThe range of driving strengths where the only attractor is w = 0, exists for all \u03b3 \u2208\n(0, 0.20] (although for some \u03b3 the limit cycle may undergo a number of intermediate bifurcations before disappearing from the attractor chart; see below.) This is in exact agreement\nwith the behaviour observed in the full partial differential equation [17] where the solitonic\nattractor undergoes a crisis and the flat zero solution remains the only attractor in the system. Thus we may conclude that taking into account the coupling of the soliton to the k = 0\nradiation, is sufficient to explain the occurrence of the \"desert region\" on the (h, \u03b3)-plane.\nIt is appropriate to mention here that a similar \"desert\" spanned just by a flat attractor,\narises in the externally driven NLS [33, 38]. It is natural to assume that the appearance of\nthe \"flat desert\" in the latter system can be still explained by the soliton-longwave radiation\ncoupling. (The failure of the four-dimensional reduced systems proposed in [33, 38, 34] to\ncapture the crisis of the localised attractor and reproduce the \"desert\", should be probably\nattributed to nonoptimal variational Ans\u00e4tze.)\nAlthough our finite-dimensional system with \u03b3 \u2264 0.2 correctly reproduces the sequence of\nattractors arising in the full PDE (stationary soliton \u2192 oscillating soliton \u2192 zero solution),\nit does not necessarily capture fine details of this sequence. Unlike the oscillating soliton in\nthe full NLS equation, for \u03b3 between 0.12 and 0.20 the finite-dimensional limit cycle does\nnot undergo any period-doubling bifurcations. The largest \u03b3 for which the period-doubling\noccurs in the reduced system (81)-(84), is \u03b3 = 0.12. In this case the period-2 cycle arises\nat h = 0.16 and then degenerates back to the period-1 as h is increased past h = 0.17.\nIncreasing h still further, the period-1 yields to the w = 0 solution for h \u2265 0.195, without\nany intermediate period-doublings. A similar pattern arises for \u03b3 = 0.11.\nIn the case \u03b3 = 0.10 the sequence of finite-dimensional attractors is richer. In this case\nwe observed the whole cascade of period-doubling bifurcations, culminating, for h = 0.146,\nin a chaotic attractor (centred on the fixed point). For h between 0.146 and 0.150 the only\nattractor was found to be w = 0; for h = 0.150 the chaotic attractor reappears, and for\neven greater h it degenerates to the period-2 (for h = 0.165) and then period-1 cycle (for\nh = 0.170). At h = 0.18 the cycle disappears and w = 0 was the only attractor we detected\nin a wide band of h values above h = 0.18. Next, increasing h for the fixed \u03b3 = 0.05 and\n0.07, the period-1 (P 1) limit cycle yields to the period-2 (P 2) and then to w = 0. For\n\u03b3 = 0.06 the sequence of attractors was P 1 \u2192 P 2 \u2192 (w = 0) \u2192 P 3 \u2192 P 4 \u2192 (a 4-band\nchaotic attractor) \u2192 (w = 0) \u2192 (a 2-band chaos coexisting with P 3) \u2192 (a 1-band chaos) \u2192\n(w = 0). (The last two regimes are illustrated in Fig.5.) The full NLS equation also exhibits\na rich host of attractors for \u03b3 > 0.05, including the chaotic soliton [17], [39]; however, details\nof the two bifurcation diagrams do not necessarily coincide.\nIt is only for very small \u03b3 that the finite- and infinite-dimensional dynamics are in exact\nagreement. Increasing h for the fixed \u03b3 = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04, the period-1 cycle yields\ndirectly to the w = 0 attractor. This is consistent with the absence of the period-doubling\nin the full PDE. The smallest \u03b3 for which the period-2 soliton was observed there, was\n\n\fh = 0.1050\n\nh = 0.1052\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0\n0.2\n\u22120.2\n\nIm(\u03c80)\n\nIm(\u03c80)\n\n0\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.6\nV\n\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.8\n\n(a)\n\u22121\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n(b)\n1.5\n\nRe(\u03c8 )\n0\n\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nRe(\u03c8 )\n0\n\nFigure 5: Trajectories in the four-dimensional system (81)-(84) with \u03b3 = 0.06.

Consistently with the PDE [18], no limit cycles were\ndetected for \u03b3 = 0. Instead, we observed two types of chaotic regimes. For h in a narrow\ninterval 0.0539 < h < 0.06 just above the Hopf bifurcation value h = H1 = 0.0539, the\ntrajectory was seen to wind chaotically in an annulus centred on the unstable fixed point\n(Fig.6a). The outer radius of the annulus is approximately one order of magnitude smaller\nthan w = 2(1+h), the w-coordinate of the fixed point. This proximity of the orbit to the fixed\npoint justifies one of the assumptions made in the derivation of the finite-dimensional system\n(81)-(84). The strange attractor shown in Fig.6a represents\u221asmall chaotic oscillations of the\namplitude of the soliton about its stationary value |\u03c8|x=0 = 1 + h. The chaotic oscillations\nof the undamped soliton were indeed observed in numerical simulations of the full nonreduced\nNLS equation [40]; however these would die out as transients and the evolution settle to\neither a slowly growing or decaying breather [18]. The fact that the chaotic attractor does\nnot arise in the full partial differential equation with \u03b3 = 0 and only persists as a transient\nchaos, can be explained by the interaction of the soliton with short and medium wavelength\n\n\fh = 0.055\n\nh = 0.060\n2.5\n\n(a)\n\n0.25\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n1.5\n\n0.15\n1\n\n0.05\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nIm(\u03c8 )\n\nIm(\u03c80)\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.15\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22120.25\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\nRe(\u03c8 )\n0\n\n1.2\n\n\u22122.5\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nRe(\u03c8 )\n0\n\nFigure 6: Trajectories in the finite-dimensional system (81)-(84) with \u03b3 = 0.

For h greater than 0.06 (but smaller than H2 = 0.39, the upper boundary of the\nfixed point's instability domain), the chaotic solution is no longer centred on the fixed point.\n(See Fig.6b). What is even more important, the amplitude of the aperiodic oscillations\ngrows rapidly. Therefore the finite-dimensional system is not applicable in this region and\nthe chaotic solution shown in Fig.6b does not have a counterpart in the full nonreduced\npartial differential equation.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIt was proposed by various authors [18, 33, 34, 35, 41] that the coupling to the radiation (more\nspecifically, to its long-wavelength component [33, 34, 35, 38]) is the key factor determining\nthe internal dynamics of the damped driven soliton, in particular its instability, bifurcations\nand transition to chaos. The main objective of the present work was to study the role of the\nsoliton-radiation interaction within an approach which allows a rigorous decomposition of the\nphase space into the soliton and radiation modes. Our treatment is based on the RiemannHilbert problem, a modern version of the Inverse Scattering transform. Although the Inverse\nScattering method had already been utilised in a related context (for the externally driven\nNLS [26, 33, 34, 41]), our approach is different in that we are not assuming the damping and\ndriving terms to be small in any sense. Instead, we are exploiting a remarkable coincidence\nbetween the mathematical formula for the parametrically driven damped soliton and that\n\n\fof the soliton of the unperturbed NLS. This coincidence allows to associate the stationary\ndamped-driven soliton with a stationary zero of the Riemann-Hilbert problem - for any h\nand \u03b3. The evolution of all nearby solutions \u03c8(x, t) can therefore be studied through the\nevolution of the corresponding scattering data.\nSome interesting insights are gained already from the linearised equations for the spectral\ndata. Conclusions of this analysis are consistent with results of the linearisation in the\nspace of fields \u03c8(x, t) [13]; however the linearisation in the spectral space has an important\nadvantage that it can be carried out analytically whereas linearised equations for \u03c8(x, t)\ncould only be studied by means of computer. The stationary soliton looses its stability as\na result of its coupling to radiation waves. This had already been proposed before [42] but\nnow we have put this claim on rigorous footing.\nWe attempted to advance beyond the linear approximation and track the effect of the\nlong-wavelength radiation on the nonlinear dynamics of the soliton. To find a closed system\nfor the evolution of the scattering data, we had to make two assumptions. First, we assumed\nthat the solution of our damped driven NLS remains close to the stationary soliton of the\nsame, perturbed, equation. Second, we assumed that the resulting system for the evolution\nof the spectral data is linear in radiation. (Note that we are not requiring the perturbation\nin the right-hand side of (1) to be small in any sense.)\nThe outcome of this analysis is a dynamical system (81)-(84) comprising equations for the\namplitude and phase of the soliton, and for the complex amplitude of the k = 0-radiation.\nFinite-dimensional reductions of both externally [33, 34, 35, 38] and parametrically [42, 43]\ndriven NLS are available in literature and hence we need to emphasise the differences. The\nprincipal difference between our reduction and those obtained variationally [34, 38, 42, 43]\nor by the Galerkin projections [35], lies in that our system of ODEs is not a product of\nany phenomenological Ansatz. It results from a rigorous expansion of the solution of the\nPDE over a set of \"nonlinear modes\" and then retaining only those modes whose effect\non the dynamics we are trying to track down. A failure of one or the other variational or\nGalerkin approximation to capture essentials of the supercritical dynamics of the soliton\ndoes not provide any information on why this particular Ansatz fails. One has to try a\nvariety of different Ans\u00e4tze, select the one that gives the best fit and then attempt to make\nsome semi-intuitive conclusions on the role of this or that ingredient of the trial function.\nOn the contrary, our approach allows to explore, systematically, each part of the phase\nspace and identify the nonlinear modes responsible for each particular dynamical effect.\nNext, our reduction technique is different from the approach of an influential paper [33]\nwhich is also partially based on the Inverse Scattering. Besides the fact that the analysis\nof Ref. [33] relies on the smallness of the perturbation, it only uses the Inverse Scattering\ntransform to obtain the functional form of the radiation wave whereas its interaction with\nthe soliton is introduced variationally. The damping term for the radiation was not part of\nthe variational algorithm and had to be added in an ad-hoc way. The method does not define\nthe amplitude of the radiation either; this is introduced empirically and then fitted to match\nthe numerical data. Unlike Ref. [33], our finite-dimensional reduction is uniquely defined by\nthe choice of the ingredients of the localised attractor and does not require introduction of\nany phenomenological terms or fitting parameters. This uniqueness is reflected by the fact\nthat (the linearisation of) our reduced system retains the self-similarity invariance of the\n\n\f(linearised) PDE.\nThe analysis of the reduced dynamical system shows that it is capable of explaining only\nsome parts and only some rough features of the attractor chart of the parametrically driven\ndamped NLS [17]. Most notably, the interaction with long radiation waves is sufficient to\nreproduce the approximate sequence of attractors arising when the driving strength is increased under the fixed dissipation coefficient. Consistently with computer simulations of\n[17, 39], the finite-dimensional system exhibits the sequence \"stationary soliton \u2192 periodically oscillating soliton\" for larger dampings and \"stationary soliton \u2192 oscillating soliton \u2192\nflat zero solution\" for smaller \u03b3. For \u03b3 = 0 the reduced system does not predict oscillating\nsolitons with bounded amplitudes (apart from a tiny window of h values). This is also in\nagreement with the behaviour observed in the full PDE [18]. However, the finite-dimensional\nsystem predicts - erroneously - the occurrence of the second, restabilising, Hopf bifurcation. As a result of that, the finite-dimensional fixed point turns out to be stable for all \u03b3\nas long as h \u2265 0.4, whereas the actual stability domain of the stationary soliton is much\nsmaller [13]. One could have expected that the reduced and infinite-dimensional dynamics\nwould be close in the region adjacent to the first, destabilising, Hopf bifurcation curve -\nwhich does provide a reasonably good approximation to the Hopf bifurcation curve in the\nfull PDE. In the actual fact, however, details of the attractors and bifurcation sequences in\nthe two systems are quite different even in that region. (An exception is the band of very\nsmall \u03b3, \u03b3 < 0.05.)\nThus, taking into account just the k = 0 component of radiation is insufficient for\nreproducing the entire complexity in the damped-driven soliton's dynamics. It is quite\npossible that the radiation waves with the frequency close to the double frequency of the\nsoliton's linear oscillations [18] play a more important (or equally important) role than those\nwith k = 0. On the other hand, numerical simulations on finite intervals reveal the excitation\nof radiations with several wavenumbers [41]. It is not unprobable that a similar wavenumber\nselection and competition occur on the infinite line. Finally, there are indications that the\noscillating soliton of the externally driven NLS, is in fact a bound state of two solitons of\nthe unperturbed, integrable, NLS equation [38]. A similar mechanism may operate in the\nparametrically driven case as well. Our approach allows to test all these possibilities; we are\nplanning to do so in future publications.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Nora Alexeeva for her help in the course of this work.
