Introduction\nRecently the structure of D-branes in a B field background has attracted much attention. The\ncase of flat branes in a constant B background has been studied extensively (see e.g. [1]), and\nleads to quantum spaces with a Moyal-Weyl star product. This was later generalized to nonconstant, closed B [2]. A rather different situation is given by D-branes on compact Lie groups\nG, which carry a (NSNS) B field which is not closed. It has been shown, using CFT [3] and\nDBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) [4] descriptions that stable branes can wrap certain conjugacy classes\nin the group manifold. On the other hand, the matrix model [5] and CFT calculations [6] led to\na beautiful picture where, in a special limit, the macroscopic branes are formed as a bound state\nof D0-branes. Attempting to unify these various approaches, we proposed in a recent paper [7]\na matrix description of D - branes on SU (2). This led to a quantum algebra based on quantum\ngroup symmetries, which reproduced all static properties of stable D-branes on SU (2).\nIn the present paper, we generalize the methods of [7] and propose a simple and compact\ndescription of all (untwisted) D-branes on group manifolds G, using quantum algebras related\nto Uq (g). More specifically, we show that a simple algebra known for more than 10 years as\nreflection equation (RE) leads to precisely the same branes as the DBI approach or the WZW\nmodel. It not only reproduces their configurations in G, i.e. the positions of the corresponding\nconjugacy classes, but also a (quantized) algebra of functions on the branes which turns out\nto be essentially the same as given by CFT. Moreover, both generic and degenerate branes\nare predicted, again in agreement with the CFT results. In particular, we identify branes on\nSU (N + 1) which are quantizations of CP N , and we show that they precisely correspond to the\nfuzzy CP N constructed in [8, 9].\nWe do not attempt here to recover all known branes on G, such as twisted branes or \"type\nB branes\" [12] but concentrate on the untwisted branes. Given the success and simplicity of\nour description, it seems quite possible, however, that these other branes are described by RE\nas well. Our results can be briefly summarized as follows: D-branes on G are described by the\nRE. A large class of irreps of RE corresponds to irreps of Uq (g), and describes untwisted branes.\nWe should point out that all mathematical constructions are basically well-known. In spite of\nthis, we tried to make the paper accessible to a wide audience, by giving the basic constructions\nand results in the main body of the paper while postponing many technical aspects to the\nAppendix. The paper can be read from a variety of viewpoints, starting from a string theorists\nperspective emphasizing the agreement with other approaches, but also from a more algebraic\npoint of view given the simple and compact description of quantized adjoint orbits on G.\nThe paper is summarized as follows. Some basic facts about (untwisted) D-branes on\ncompact Lie groups and their description in CFT are recalled in Section 2, with emphasis on\nthose aspects which are useful in later considerations. We argue that the finite set of primaries\nof BCFT of a D-branes can be interpreted in terms of NCG, i.e. they provide a picture of\n\n\fD-branes as quantum manifolds. Moreover, we claim that the appropriate symmetry algebra\nis a particular quantum group, replacing (in a sense) the chiral affine algebra b\ngL \u00d7 b\ngR . The\nquantum manifold is defined as an associative algebra, generated by some elements subject to\ncertain relations. In Section 3 we postulate these relations (the so-called reflection equations\n\nRE), and discuss their basic properties. In particular, we show that RE has all the required\nproperties under the quantum group. The D-branes are then obtained from representations of\nRE. These are are studied in Section 4, where we justify our claims. In particular, we calculate\nthe positions of the D-branes on the group manifold, their energies, and perform the harmonic\nanalysis on their quantized world-volumes. Our constructions are illustrated in some examples\nin Section 5, studying fuzzy CPqN in more detail, and reviewing the SU (2) case in order to\nmake clear the connection with our previous paper [7]. Finally, some technical discussions are\ncollected in the Appendices.\n\n2. CFT and classical description of untwisted D-branes\nThis section deals with the CFT description of branes in WZW models on G, and their classical\ninterpretation as certain sub-manifolds in the group manifold G. All the results presented here\nare well known and serve only as inspiration to the algebraic considerations in the rest of the\npaper. The reader who is not familiar with CFT and string theory may skip this part of the\npaper and go directly to the Subsection 2.3.\n2.1 Some Lie algebra notations\nWe collect some notations used throughout this paper. g denotes the (simple, finite-dimensional)\n\u03b1 *\u03b1\n\nLie algebra of G, with Cartan matrix Aij = 2 \u03b1ji *\u03b1jj . Here * is the Killing form which is defined for\narbitrary weights, and \u03b1i are the simple roots. The set of dominant integral weights is denoted\nby\n\nX\nni \u039bi ; ni \u2208 Z\u22650 },\nP+ = {\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the fundamental weights \u039bi satisfy \u03b1i * \u039bj = d\u03b1i \u03b4ij , and the length of a root \u03b1 is d\u03b1 = \u03b1*\u03b1\n2 .\n1P\nThe Weyl vector is the sum over all positive roots, \u03c1 = 2 \u03b1>0 \u03b1. For a positive integer k, one\ndefines the \"fundamental alcove\" in weight space as\n\nPk+ = {\u03bb \u2208 P + ; \u03bb * \u03b8 \u2264 k}\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the highest root. It is a finite set of dominant integral weights. For G = SU (N ), this\nP\nP\nis explicitly Pk+ = { ni \u039bi ;\ni ni \u2264 k}. We shall normalize the Killing form such that d\u03b8 = 1,\n\nso that the dual Coxeter number is given by g \u2228 = (\u03c1 + 12 \u03b8) * \u03b8, which is N for SU (N ).\n\nFor any weight \u03bb, we define H\u03bb \u2208 g to be the Cartan element which takes the value H\u03bb v\u03bc =\n(\u03bb * \u03bc) v\u03bc on vectors v\u03bc with weight \u03bc in some representation. We shall consider only finitedimensional representations (=modules) of g. V\u03bb denotes the irreducible highest-weight module\n\n\fof G with highest weight \u03bb \u2208 P + , and V\u03bb+ is the conjugate (=dual) module of V\u03bb . The defining\nrepresentation of the classical matrix groups SU (N ), SO(N ), and Sp(N ) will be denoted by\nVN , being N -dimensional.\n2.2 WZW D-branes\nThe WZW model is specified by a group G and a level k [10, 11]. We shall consider only simple,\ncompact groups (G will be SU (N ) mainly), so that the level k must be a positive integer. The\nWZW branes can be described by boundary states |Bii \u2208 Hclosed respecting a set of boundary\nconditions. A large class of boundary conditions is of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nJn + \u03b3\u0303(J \u0303\u2212n ) |Bii = 0\nn\u2208Z\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0303 is an auto-morphism of the affine Lie algebra b\ng1 . Here Jn are the modes of the leftmoving currents and J \u0303n are the modes of the right-moving currents. Boundary states with \u03b3\u0303 = 1\nare called \"symmetry-preserving branes\" or \"untwisted branes\": these are the object of interest\n\nin this paper. The untwisted (\u03b3\u0303 = 1) boundary condition (2.3) breaks half of the symmetries of\nthe WZW model b\ngL \u00d7 b\ngR down to the vector part b\ngV .\n\nThe condition (2.3) alone does not define a good boundary state: one must also impose open-\n\nclosed string duality of the amplitude describing interactions of branes. This leads to so called\nCardy (boundary) states. For the untwisted case they are labelled by \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ corresponding\nto integrable irreps of b\ng, which are precisely the weights in the \"fundamental alcove\" (2.2).\n\nTherefore the untwisted branes are in one-to-one correspondence with \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ . The CFT\ndescription yields also an important formula for the energy of the brane \u03bb,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1*(\u03bb+\u03c1)\nsin\n\u03c0\nk+g \u2228\nY\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE\u03bb =\n\u03b1>0 sin \u03c0 \u03b1*\u03c1\u2228\nk+g\n\n(2.4)\n\nFor k \u226b N , one can expand the denominator in (2.4) to obtain a formula which compared with\nDBI [12] shows that the leading k-dependence fits perfectly with the interpretation of a brane\nwrapping once a conjugacy class given by an element t\u03bb of the maximal torus of G (see the next\nsubsection).\nThe CFT provides hints towards the description of branes as quantum manifolds. It is\nknown that the dynamics of D-branes is given by open string excitations. The relevant operators,\nentering as building blocks of the string operators, are the primary fields of the BCFT with the\nsymmetry algebra of the unbroken part b\ngL \u00d7 b\ngR , i.e. b\ngV . The number of lowest conformal\n\nweight primaries is finite for any compact WZW model (in general for any RCFT). In the\nk \u2192 \u221e limit, the primaries can be interpreted as corresponding to a (finite dimensional) algebra\n1\n\ng is the horizontal algebra of b\ng, and the Lie algebra of G.\n\n\fof functions on the brane (see [14, 13] and Section 4.2). For finite k, the interpretation is\nnot that clear because the candidate algebra as given in [14] is not associative. However as\nexplained in [14, 7] for g = su(2), the algebra becomes associative after \"twisting\" (resulting in\na modification of the product of the primary fields), so that it can be considered as an algebra\nof functions of a quantum manifold. Then the primaries become modules of the quantum group\nUq (su(2)). We argued in [7] that the relations defining the algebra of functions on the quantum\nmanifold is invariant under the full chiral counterpart of the chiral current algebra, i.e. under\nUq (su(2)L \u00d7 su(2)R )R .\nHere we shall follow the line of reasoning of [7] replacing g = su(2) by any compact, simple\nLie algebra g, noting that the technical arguments for twisting and associativity generalize. We\nshall therefore assume that one can modify the product of primary fields such that they form an\nassociative algebra, and transform under a suitable quantum group Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R (or GL \u2297R GR )\nas given below.\n2.3 The classical description of D\u2013branes on group manifolds.\nThe D-branes whose quantum description has been given in the previous subsection have a\nnice geometrical interpretation: they correspond to the conjugacy classes of the group manifold\nunder the adjoint action. Here we describe some properties of those sub-manifolds. The results\npresented in the forthcoming sections can also be viewed as a quantization of those sub-manifolds.\nLet G be the classical group manifold (we will consider mainly SU (N ), but all constructions\ncan be used for other groups such as SO(N ), U Sp(N ) as well). At the classical level, the D\u2013\nbranes under consideration are described by (twisted) conjugacy classes of the form\nC(t) = {gt\u03b3(g)\u22121 ;\n\ng \u2208 G}.\n\n(2.5)\n\nHere \u03b3 is an auto-morphism of G, which is related to that of (2.3). In this paper we shall consider\nonly trivial \u03b3, leaving the \u03b3 6= id case to a future publication. One can take t belonging to a\nmaximal torus T of G, i.e. t is a diagonal matrix for G = SU (N ). Then C(t) can be viewed as\nhomogeneous spaces (see Appendix A.3):\nC(t) \u223c\n= G/Kt .\nHere Kt = {g \u2208 G :\n\n(2.6)\n\n[g, t] = 0} is the stabilizer of t \u2208 T . \"Regular\" conjugacy classes\n\nare those with Kt = T , and they are isomorphic to G/T . In particular, their dimension is\ndim(C(t)) = dim(G) \u2212 rank(G). \"Degenerate\" conjugacy classes have a larger stability group\nKt , hence their dimension is smaller; e.g. at the extremal case C(t = 1) is a point. These\nconjugacy classes are invariant under the adjoint action\nG\u22121\nV C(t)GV = C(t)\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fof the vector subgroup GV \u0592\u2192 GL \u00d7 GR , which is diagonally embedded in the group of (left\nand right) motions on G. This reflects the breaking b\ngL \u00d7 b\ngR \u2192 \u011dV . We want to preserve this\n\nsymmetry pattern in the quantum case, in a suitable sense.\nThe space of harmonics on C(t).\n\nA lot of information about the spaces C(t) can be obtained\n\nfrom the harmonic analysis, i.e. by decomposing scalar fields on C(t) into harmonics under the\naction of the (vector) symmetry GV . This is particularly useful here, because quantized spaces\nare described in terms of their algebra of functions. The decomposition of this space of functions\nF(C(t)) into harmonics can be calculated explicitly using (2.6), and it must be preserved after\nquantization, at least up to some cutoff. Otherwise, the quantization would not be admissible.\nOne finds (see Appendix A.3 and [13])\nF(C(t)) \u223c\n=\n\nM\n\n(K )\n\nmult\u03bb+t V\u03bb .\n\n(2.8)\n\n\u03bb\u2208P +\n\nHere \u03bb runs over all dominant integral weights P + , V\u03bb is the corresponding highest-weight\n(K )\n\nG-module, and mult\u03bb+t is the dimension of the subspace of V\u03bb+ which is invariant under Kt .\nCharacterization of the stable D\u2013branes.\n\nFrom the CFT [3, 13] and DBI considerations\n\n[4, 12], one finds that there is only a finite set of stable D\u2013branes on G (up to global motions),\none for each integral weight \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ . They are given by C(t\u03bb ) for\nt\u03bb = exp(2\u03c0i\n\nH\u03bb + H\u03c1\n).\nk + g\u2228\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe restriction to \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ follows from the fact that in general, different integral \u03bb may label\nthe same conjugacy class. Because the exponential in (2.9) is periodic, this happens precisely if\nthe weights are related by the affine Weyl group, which is generated by the ordinary Weyl group\ni\ntogether with translations of the form \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb + (k + g\u2228 ) \u03b12\u03b1\n. Hence one should restrict the\ni *\u03b1i\n\nweights to the fundamental domain of this affine Weyl group, which is the fundamental alcove\nPk+ (2.2) but with k \u2192 k + g \u2228 .\nInformation about the location of these (untwisted) branes in G is provided by the quantities\nsn = tr(g n ) = tr(tn ),\n\ng \u2208 C(t)\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhich are invariant under the adjoint action (2.7). The trace is over the defining representation\nVN (= V\u039b1 in the case of SU (N ), where \u039b1 is the fundamental weight) of the matrix group G,\nof dimension N . For the classes C(t\u03bb ), they can be easily calculated:\nsn = trVN (q 2n(H\u03c1 +H\u03bb ) ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bd\u2208VN\n\nwhere\ni\u03c0\n\nq = e k+g\u2228 .\n\n2\u03c0in (\u03c1+\u03bb)*\u03bd\nk+g \u2228\n\ne\n\n(2.11)\n\n\fThe sn are independent functions of the weight \u03bb for all n = 1, 2, ..., rank(G), which completely\ncharacterize the class C(t\u03bb ). These functions have the great advantage that their quantum\nanalogs (3.11) can be calculated exactly.\nAn equivalent characterization of these conjugacy classes is provided by a characteristic\nequation: for any g \u2208 C(t\u03bb ), the relation P\u03bb (g) = 0 holds in M at(VN , C), where P\u03bb is the\npolynomial\nP\u03bb (x) =\n\nY\n\n(x \u2212 q 2(\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd ).\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u03bd\u2208VN\n\nThis follows immediately from (2.9): t\u03bb has the eigenvalues q 2(\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd on the weights \u03bd of the\ndefining representation VN . Again, we will find analogous characteristic equations in the quantum case.\n\n3. Quantum algebras and symmetries for branes\nWe expect that the relevant quantum spaces are described by quantum algebras M which\ntransform appropriately under a quantum symmetry. To find M we shall make an \"educated\nguess\" based on the considerations in Section 2.2, and justify it by comparing its predictions with\nthe results listed above. Thus first we postulate the form of the relations between generators\nof the quantum algebra. We expect the relations to be at most quadratic in generators, and to\nhave appropriate covariance under the action of a quantum group which should correspond to\nthe chiral b\ngL \u00d7 b\ngR . This quantum group will be Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R . Moreover we require the central\n\nterms of the algebra to be invariant under the \"vector\" subalgebra of this quantum symmetry.\nThus our constructions mimic the symmetry pattern and its breaking by the D-branes in CFT.\nThis is discussed in Section 3.2.\n3.1 The module algebra\nThe discussion invoked in the end of Section 2.2 suggests that M should be a module algebra2\n\nunder some quantum group. Moreover, it suggests that this quantum group is a version of\nUq (g), the representations of which are parallel to those of b\ng of the WZW model. Since we are\nconsidering matrix groups G, we assume that the appropriate quantum (module) algebra M is\n\ngenerated by elements Mji with indices i, j in the defining representation VN of G, subject to\n\nsome commutation relations and constraints. With hindsight, we claim that these relations are\ngiven by the so-called reflection equation (RE) [16], which in a short notation reads\nR21 M1 R12 M2 = M2 R21 M1 R12 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere R is the R matrix of Uq (g) in the defining representation. Displaying the indices explicitly,\nthis means\n(RE)\n2\n\ni k\nj l\n\n:\n\nRk a i b Mcb Rc j a d Mld = Mak Ra b i c Mdc Rd j b l .\n\nsee Appendix A.2 for the mathematical definition\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fThe indices {i, j}, {k, l} correspond to the first (1) and the second (2) vectors space VN in (3.1).\nSome examples of algebras generated by RE relations are presented in Section 5. For q = 1,\nthis reduces to [Mji , Mlk ] = 0. Because M should describe the quantized group manifold G,\nwe need to impose constraints which ensure that the branes are indeed embedded in such a\nquantum group manifold. In the case G = SU (N ), these are detq (M ) = 1 where detq is the\nso-called quantum determinant (3.14), and suitable reality conditions imposed on the generators\nMji . Both will be discussed below.\nFollowing [7], the Mji 's can also be thought of as some matrices (as in Myers model [5]) out\nof which we can form an action invariant under the relevant quantum groups. The action has\nthe structure S = trq (1 + ...), where dots represent some expressions in the M 's (the quantum\ntrace is defined in (4.4)). The point of [7] was that for some equations of motion, the \"dots\"terms vanish on classical configurations. We postulate that the equations of motion for M are\ngiven by RE (3.1). If so, then their energy is equal to\nE = trq (1).\n\n(3.3)\n\nAs we shall see this energy is not just a constant (as might be suggested by the notation), but it\ndepends on the representations of the algebra, where it becomes the quantum dimension (4.4).\nWe should mention here that RE appeared more then 10 years ago in the context of the\nboundary integrable models, and is sometimes called boundary YBE [16]. Hence one might also\nthink of (3.1) as being analogs of the boundary condition (2.3). As we shall see, RE has indeed\nsimilar symmetry properties. This is the subject of the the following subsection.\n3.2 Quantum symmetries of RE\nSince M is supposed to be a module algebra, we have to specify under which quantum group\nit transforms. The construction of the quantum symmetry algebra is a straightforward generalization of the approach of [7], replacing su(2) by g. However we found it more convenient\nto work with a dual version of this symmetry, which leads directly to the desired results. We\nshall present here a simple practical version and postpone the precise mathematical definitions\nto Appendix A.2.\nThere are 2 equivalent ways to look at the symmetry of RE, involving the Hopf algebras\nGL \u2297R GR and Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R respectively, which are dual to each other. We first assume that\nthe matrix M transforms as\nMji \u2192 (s\u22121 M t)ij\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere sij and tij generate the algebras GL and GR respectively, which both coincide with the\nwell\u2013known quantum groups F unq (G) as defined in [17] so e.g. s2 s1 R = Rs1 s2 , t2 t1 R = Rt1 t2 .3\nIn (3.4) matrix multiplication is understood. This is a symmetry of RE if we impose that (the\n3\n\nR with suppressed indices means R12 .\n\n\fmatrix elements of) s and t commute with M , and additionally satisfy s2 t1 R = Rt1 s2 . Notice\nthat (3.4) is a quantum analog of the action of the classical isometry group GL \u00d7 GR on classical\ngroup element g as in Section (2.3).\nSymmetries become powerful only because they have a group-like structure, i.e. they can\nbe iterated. In the above language this means that we can define a Hopf algebra (called from\nnow on GL \u2297R GR ):\ns2 s1 R = R s1 s2 ,\n\nt2 t1 R = R t1 t2 ,\n\n\u2206s = s \u2297 s,\n\n\u2206t = t \u2297 t,\n\nS(s) = s\u22121 ,\n\n\u01eb(sij ) = \u03b4ji ,\n\ns 2 t1 R = R t1 s 2\n\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nS(t) = t\u22121 ,\n\n\u01eb(tij ) = \u03b4ji\n\n(3.7)\n\n(here S is the antipode, and \u01eb the counit). The inverse matrices s\u22121 and t\u22121 are defined after\nsuitable further (determinant-like) constraints on s and t are imposed, as in [17]. Formally, M\nis a right GL \u2297R GR - comodule algebra; see Appendix A.2 for further details.\nFurthermore, GL \u2297R GR can be mapped to a vector Hopf algebra GV with generators r, by\nsij \u2297 1 \u2192 rji and 1 \u2297 tij \u2192 rji (thus basically identifying s = t = r on the rhs). The (co)action of\nGV on the M 's is then\nMji \u2192 (r \u22121 M r)ij .\n\n(3.8)\n\nEquivalently, we can consider the Hopf algebra Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R which is dual to GL \u2297R GR .\nFor the details we refer to Appendix A.2; we only state here that it is generated by 2 copies\nUq (gL ), Uq (gL ) of Uq (g), which act on the the generators of M as\n(uL \u2297 uR ) \u22b2 Mji = \u03c0ki (SuL )Mlk \u03c0jl (uR )\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere \u03c0() is the defining representation VN of Uq (g). This is a symmetry of M in the usual\nsense, because the rhs is again an element in M. The \"vector\" part of this symmetry is obtained\nusing the Hopf algebra map u \u2208 Uq (gV ) \u2192 \u2206(u) \u2208 Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R . It acts on M as\nu \u22b2 Mji = \u03c0ki (Su1 )Mlk \u03c0jl (u2 )\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere u1 \u2297 u2 = \u2206(u) is the standard coproduct of Uq (g).\nWe would like to stress here two crucial points in our construction: the first is the existence\nof a vector sub-algebra Uq (gV ) of Uq (gL \u00d7gR )R (and the analogous notion for the dual GL \u2297R GR ).\nThis is important because the central terms of M which characterize its representations will be\ninvariant only with respect to that Uq (gV ) (and GV ). This will allow to interpret these subalgebras as isometries of the quantum D-branes. The second point is the fact that the RE\nimposes very similar conditions on the symmetries and their breaking as the original BCFT\nWZW model described in section 2.2 does.\n\n\f3.3 Central elements of RE\nBelow we discuss some general properties of the algebra defined by (3.1). We need to find the\ncentral elements, which are expected to characterize its irreps. This problem was solved in the\nsecond paper of [18]. The (generic) central elements of the algebra (3.1) are\ncn = trq (M n ) \u2261 trVN (M n v) \u2208 M,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere the trace is taken over the defining representation VN , and\nv = \u03c0(q \u22122H\u03c1 )\n\n(3.12)\n\nis a numerical matrix which satisfies S 2 (r) = v \u22121 rv for the generator r of GV . These elements\ncn are independent for n = 1, 2, ..., rank(G). A proof of centrality can be found e.g. in the book\n[19], Section 10.3; see also Appendix A.5. Here we check only invariance under GV (see (3.8)):\ncn \u2192\n\ntrq (r \u22121 M n r) = (r \u22121 )ij (M n )jk rlk vil\n= S(rji )(M n )jk vlk S 2 (ril ) = (M n )jk vlk S(S(ril )rji ) = (M n )jk vjk = cn\n\n(3.13)\n\nas required. As we shall see, the cn 's for n = 1, ...rank(G) \u2212 1 fix the position of the brane\nconfiguration on the group manifold i.e. they are quantum analogs of the sn 's (2.11).\nThere should be another central term which is the quantum analog of the ordinary determinant, which is necessary to define quantum SU (N ). It is known as the quantum determinant,\ndenoted by detq (M ). While it can be expressed as a polynomial in cn 's (n = 1, ..., rank(G)),\ndetq (M ) is invariant under the full chiral quantum algebra. Hence we impose the constraint\n1 = detq (M )\n\n(3.14)\n\nFor other groups such as SO(N ) and SP (N ), additional constraints (which are also invariant\nunder the full chiral quantum algebra) must be imposed. These are known and can be found\nin the literature [20], but their explicit form is not needed for the forthcoming considerations.\nAppendix A.4 contains details about how to calculate detq (M ) and provides some explicit expressions.\n3.4 Realizations of RE\nIn this section we find realizations (algebra homomorphisms) of the RE algebra (3.1) in terms\nof some other algebras. This can be viewed as an intermediate step towards finding representations. We use a technique generating new solutions out of constant solutions (i.e. trivial\nrepresentations). Thus first we consider\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nR21 M1 R12 M2\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n= M2 R21 M1 R12 ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere the entries of the matrices M (0) are c-numbers. Then one checks that\nM = L+ M (0) S(L\u2212 )\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fsatisfies (3.1), if the matrices L\u00b1 respect (see also [21], p.285)\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 \u00b1\nRL\u00b1\n2 L1 = L1 L2 R,\n\n\u2212\n\u2212 +\nRL+\n2 L1 = L1 L2 R.\n\n(3.17)\n\nNotice that detq (M ) = detq (M (0) ) due to chiral invariance of the q-determinant. Clearly the\nform of (3.16) is closely related to the GL \u2297R GR invariance of the RE. Thus we have trade\nour original problem to the problem of finding matrices L\u00b1 respecting (3.17). Luckily this is\nknown for a long time due to the famous work of Faddeev, Reshetikhin and Takhtajan [17], who\nnoted that (3.1) together with the determinant\u2013condition (and others for groups other than\nSU (N )) provides one possible definition of the quantized universal enveloping algebra Uq (g).\nMore precisely, they showed that L\u00b1 can be expressed in terms of generators of the Uq (g)\nalgebra as follows\nL+ = (id \u2297 \u03c0)(R),\n\nL\u2212 = (\u03c0 \u2297 id)(R\u22121 )\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere R = R1 \u2297 R2 is the universal R-matrix for Uq (g), and \u03c0 is the defining representation\nof Uq (g)4 . In order to be more transparent, we write the component form of (3.18): (L+ )ij =\n\u22121 i\n\u2212\nR1 \u03c0(R2 )ij , (L\u2212 )ij = R\u22121\n2 \u03c0(R1 )j . One can also show that SL (which we shall need later) is\n\nSL\u2212 = (\u03c0 \u2297 id)(R).\n\n(3.19)\n\nThe reason why (3.18) respect (3.17) is the YBE equation for R, written in several equivalent\nforms\nR12 R13 R23 = R23 R13 R12\n\n(3.20)\n\n\u22121\nR13 R23 R\u22121\n12 = R12 R23 R13\n\n(3.21)\n\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\nR\u22121\n13 R23 R12 = R12 R23 R13 .\n\n(3.22)\n\nThe action of 1 \u2297 \u03c0 \u2297 \u03c0 in the first line, \u03c0 \u2297 1 \u2297 \u03c0 in the second line, and \u03c0 \u2297 \u03c0 \u2297 1 in the third line\nimmediately produces (3.17). It is useful to realize that L+ are lower triangular matrices with\nX\u03b1+ 's below the diagonal, and L\u2212 are upper triangular matrices with X\u03b1\u2212 's above the diagonal.\nExplicitly, for sl2 one has\n+\n\nL =\n\nq H/2\n1\n\nq \u2212 2 \u03bbX+\n\n0\nq \u2212H/2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\u2212\n\nL =\n\nq \u2212H/2\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2212 q 2 \u03bbX\u2212\nq H/2\n\n!\n\n(3.23)\n\nThe form of the solution (3.18) shows that M generates a sub-algebra of Uq (g). The subalgebra depends on M (0) . We will not discuss the most general M (0) here (see e.g. [18]), but\nconsider only the most obvious solution, which is a diagonal matrix. The specific values of the\ndiagonal entries do not change the algebra generated by the elements of M , because they simply\nmultiply some entries of M . The other, non-diagonal M (0) 's presumably also correspond to some\n4\n\nThe R-matrix of (3.2) is Ri j k l = \u03c0 i j (R1 )\u03c0 k l (R2 ).\n\n\fbranes: we hope to come back to this issue in a future paper. Using [17], we conclude that the\nalgebra generated by the elements of M is essentially Uq (g). As we will see, choosing a definite\nrepresentation of Uq (g) then corresponds to choosing a brane configuration, and determines\nthe algebra of function on the brane. To be explicit, we give the solution for g = sl2 and\nM (0) = diag(1, 1):\n\uf8eb\n\nM = L+ M (0) S(L\u2212 ) = \uf8ed\n\nqH\nq\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u03bbX+\n\nq\nq H/2\n\n\u2212 21\n\nq \u2212H\n\n\u03bbq H/2 X\u2212\n\n+ q \u22121 \u03bb2 X+ X\u2212\n\nOne can verify that detq (M ) = 1, according to (A.17).\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.24)\n\n3.5 Covariance\nWe show in Appendix A.5 that for any solutions of the form M = L+ M (0) S(L\u2212 ) where M (0) is\na constant solution of the RE, the \"vector\" rotations (3.10) can be realized as quantum adjoint\naction:\nu \u22b2 Mji = \u03c0ki (Su1 )Mlk \u03c0jl (u2 ) = u1 Mji Su2 \u2208 M\n\n(3.25)\n\nfor u \u2208 M, where \u03c0() is the defining representation VN of Uq (g). Here we consider M \u2282 Uq (g)\nso that \u2206(u) = u1 \u2297 u2 is defined in Uq (g) \u2297 Uq (g), nevertheless the rhs is in M. This is as it\nshould be in a quantum theory: the action of a symmetry is implemented by a conjugation in\nthe algebra of operators. It will be essential later to do the harmonic analysis on the branes.\n3.6 Reality structure\nAn algebra M can be considered as a quantized (algebra of complex-valued functions on a) space\nonly if it is equipped with a \u2217-structure, i.e. an anti-linear (anti)-involution. For classical unitary\nmatrices, the condition would be M \u2020 = M \u22121 . To find the correct quantum version is a bit tricky;\nwe determine it by requiring that on finite-dimensional representations of M = L+ SL\u2212 (i.e. on\nthe branes, see below), the \u2217 will become the usual matrix adjoint. In term of the generators of\nUq (g), this means that (Xi\u00b1 )\u2217 = Xi\u2213 , Hi\u2217 = Hi . In the SU (2) case, this leads to\na\u2217 b\u2217\nc\u2217 d\u2217\n\n!\n\n=\n\na\u22121\n\n\u2212qca\u22121\n\n\u2212qa\u22121 b q 2 d + a \u2212 q 2 a\u22121\n\n!\n\n;\n\n(3.26)\n\na\u22121 indeed exists on the irreps of M considered here. A closed form for this star structure for\ngeneral g could also be given, but shall be omitted here.\n\n4. Representations of M and quantum D\u2013branes\nBy construction, the Mji can be considered as quantized coordinate functions on G, defining some\nkind of quantization of the manifold G. However, we are interested here in the quantization of\nthe orbits C(t\u03bb ), which are submanifolds of G. We claim that they are described by irreps (fixed\n\n\fby the set of Casimirs) \u03c0\u03bb : M \u2192 M at(V\u03bb , C) of M. Indeed, the map \u03c0\u03bb can be considered\nas the dual of the embedding map C(t\u03bb ) \u0592\u2192 G. This will allow us to make statements on the\nlocation of the branes in G.\nConsider an irreducible representation of M. The Casimirs cn (3.11) then take distinct\nvalues which can be calculated. Moreover, they are invariant under (vector) rotations as shown\nin (3.13). In view of their form (3.11), this suggests that an irrep of M should be considered as\nquantization of (the algebra of functions on) some conjugacy class C(t\u03bb ), the position of which\nis determined by the values of the Casimirs cn .\nWe will show that the irreps of M describe indeed precisely the stable D-branes. Since the\nalgebra M is5 the direct sum of the corresponding representations, the whole group manifold is\nrecovered in the limit k \u2192 \u221e where the branes become dense. To confirm this interpretation,\nwe will calculate the position of the branes on the group manifold, and study their geometry by\nperforming the harmonic analysis on the branes, i.e. by determining the set of harmonics.\nHere we shall consider only those representations of M which arise from M (0) = 1 i.e.\nM = L+ SL\u2212 (3.16). Then the representations of the algebra M coincide with those of Uq (g),\nwhich are largely understood, although quite complicated at roots of unity. The fact relevant\nfor us is that representations V\u03bb of Uq (g) with \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ have the following properties:\n\u2022 they are unitary, i.e. \u2217 reps of M with respect to the \u2217 structure of Section 3.6 (see [22])\n\u2022 their quantum-dimension dimq (V\u03bb ) = trV\u03bb (q 2H\u03c1 ) given in (4.4) is positive [15]\n\u2022 \u03bb corresponds precisely to the integrable modules of the affine Lie algebra b\ng which governs\nthe CFT.\n\nThe representations belonging to the boundary of Pk+ will correspond to the degenerate branes.\nHaving characterized the admissible representations V\u03bb , we propose that the representation of M on V\u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ is a quantized or \"fuzzy\" D\u2013brane, denoted by D\u03bb . It\nis an algebra of maps from V\u03bb to V\u03bb which transforms under the quantum adjoint action (3.25)\nof Uq (g). For \"small\" weights6 \u03bb, this algebra coincides with M at(V\u03bb ). There are some modifications for \"large\" weights \u03bb because q is a root of unity, which will be discussed in Section\n4.2. The reason is that M at(V\u03bb ) then contains unphysical degrees of freedom which should be\ntruncated.\nA first justification is that there is indeed a one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence between the (untwisted) branes in string theory and these quantum branes, since both are labeled by \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ . To\ngive a more detailed comparison, we calculate the traces (3.11), derive a characteristic equation,\nand then perform the harmonic analysis on D\u03bb . Furthermore, the energy (2.4) of the branes in\nstring theory will be recovered precisely in terms of the quantum dimension.\n5\n6\n\nmore precisely the semi-simple quotient of M, see Section 4.2\nsee Section 4.2\n\n\f4.1 Value of the central terms\nThe values of the Casimirs cn on D\u03bb are calculated in Appendix A.6:\nc0 = trVN (q \u22122H\u03c1 ) = dimq (VN ),\n\n(4.1)\n\nc1 (\u03bb) = trVN (q 2(H\u03c1 +H\u03bb ) ),\nX\ndimq (V\u03bb+\u03bd )\n,\ncn (\u03bb) =\nq 2n((\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd\u2212\u03bbN *\u03c1)\ndimq (V\u03bb )\n+\n\n(4.2)\nn \u2265 1.\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u03bd\u2208VN ; \u03bb+\u03bd\u2208Pk\n\nHere \u03bbN is the highest weight of the defining representation VN , and the sum in (4.3) goes over\nall \u03bd \u2208 VN such that \u03bb + \u03bd lies in Pk+ . c0 is \u03bb-independent uninteresting number.\nThe value of c1 (\u03bb) agrees with the corresponding value (2.11) of s1 on the classical conjugacy\nclasses C(t\u03bb ). For n \u2265 2, the values of cn (\u03bb) agree only approximately with sn on C(t\u03bb ),\nmore precisely they agree if\n\nq dim(V\u03bb+\u03bd )\nq dim(V\u03bb )\n\n\u2248 1, which holds provided \u03bb is large (hence k must be\n\nlarge too). In particular, this holds for branes which are not \"too close\" to the unit element.\nThis discrepancy for small \u03bb is perhaps not too surprising, since the higher\u2013order Casimirs are\ndefined in terms of non-commutative coordinates and are hence subject to operator\u2013ordering\nambiguities.\nWe should emphasize here that the agreement of the values of cn with their classical counterparts (2.11) shows that the M 's are indeed very reasonable variables to describe the branes.\nHence we see that the positions and the \"size\" of the branes essentially agree with the results\nfrom string theory. In particular, their size shrinks to zero if \u03bb approaches a corner of Pk+ , as\ncan be seen easily in the SU (2) case [7]: as \u03bb goes from 0 to k, the branes start at the identity\ne, grow up to the equator, and then shrink again around \u2212e. We will see that the algebra of\nfunctions on D\u03bb precisely reflects this behavior; however this is more subtle and will be discussed\nbelow. All of this is fundamentally tied to the fact that q is a root of unity.\nFurthermore, the quantum dimension of the representation space V\u03bb is\ndimq (V\u03bb ) = trq (1) = trV\u03bb (q\n\n2H\u03c1\n\n)=\n\nY sin(\u03c0 \u03b1*(\u03bb+\u03c1))\nk+g \u2228 )\n\n\u03b1>0\n\n\u03b1*\u03c1\nsin(\u03c0 k+g\n\u2228)\n\n.\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe last equality above follows from Weyl's character formula. According to the interpretation\n(3.3) it should be the energy of the D-brane, and this is indeed the case (see (2.4)).\nFinally, we show in Appendix A.7 that the generators of M satisfy the following characteristic equation on D\u03bb :\nP\u03bb (M ) =\n\nY\n\n( M \u2212 q 2(\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd\u22122\u03bbN *\u03c1 ) = 0.\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u03bd\u2208VN\n\nHere the usual matrix multiplication of the Mji is understood. Again, this (almost) matches\nwith the classical version (2.12).\n\n\f4.2 The space of harmonics on D\u03bb .\nAs discussed in Section 3, we must finally match the space of functions or harmonics on D\u03bb with\nthe ones on C(t\u03bb ), up to some cutoff. Using covariance (3.25), this amounts to calculating the\ndecomposition of M generated by (3.16) characterized by \u03bb \u2208 Pk+ under the quantum adjoint\naction of Uq (g) (3.10). i.e. decomposing V\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb\u2217 under Uq (g). To simplify the analysis, we\nassume first that \u03bb is not too large7 , so that this tensor product is completely reducible. Then\nD\u03bb coincides with the matrix algebra acting on V\u03bb ,\n\u03bc\nD\u03bb \u223c\n= M at(V\u03bb ) = V\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb\u2217 \u223c\n= \u2295\u03bc N\u03bb\u03bb+ V\u03bc ,\n\n(4.6)\n\n\u03bc\nwhere N\u03bb\u03bb\n+ are the usual fusion rules of g which can be calculated explicitly using formula\n(A.10). Here \u03bb+ is the conjugate weight to \u03bb, so that V \u2217 \u223c\n= V\u03bb+ . This has a simple geometrical\n\u03bb\n\nmeaning if \u03bc is small enough (smaller than all nonzero Dynkin labels of \u03bb, roughly speaking; see\nAppendix A.3 for details): then\n(K )\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\nN\u03bb\u03bb\n+ = mult\u03bc+ ,\n\n(4.7)\n\n(K )\n\nwhere K\u03bb \u2282 G is the stabilizer group8 of \u03bb, and mult\u03bc+\u03bb is the dimension of the subspace of\nV\u03bc\u2217 which is invariant under K\u03bb . This is proved in Appendix A.3. Note in particular that the\nmode structure (for small \u03bc) does not depend on the particular value of \u03bb, only on its stabilizer\nK\u03bb . Comparing this with the decomposition (2.8) of F(C(t\u03bb )), we see that indeed\nD\u03bb \u223c\n= F(C(t\u2032\u03bb ))\n\n(4.8)\n\nH\u03bb\nup to some cutoff in \u03bc, where t\u2032\u03bb = exp(2\u03c0i k+g\n\u2228 ). This differs slightly from (2.9), by a shift\n\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb + \u03c1. It implies that degenerate branes do occur in the our quantum algebraic description,\nbecause \u03bb may be invariant under a nontrivial subgroup K\u03bb 6= T . These degenerate branes have\nsmaller dimensions than the regular ones. An example for this is fuzzy CP N , which will be\ndiscussed in some detail below.\nHere we differ from [13] who identify only regular D\u2013branes in the CFT description, arguing\nthat \u03bb + \u03c1 is always regular. This is due to a particular limiting procedure for k \u2192 \u221e which was\nchosen in [13]. We assume k to be large but finite, and find that degenerate branes do occur.\nThis is in agreement with the CFT description of harmonics on D\u03bb , as will be discussed below.\nAlso, note that (4.8) reconciles the results (4.2), (2.11) on the position of the branes with their\nmode structure as found in CFT.\nNow we consider the general case where the tensor product M at(V\u03bb ) = V\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb\u2217 may\nnot be completely reducible. Then M at(V\u03bb ) = V\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb\u2217 contains non-classical representations\nwith vanishing quantum dimension, which have no obvious interpretation. However, there is a\nwell\u2013known remedy: one can replace the full tensor product by the so-called \"truncated tensor\nP\nP\nroughly speaking if \u03bb =\nni \u039bi , then i ni < 12 (k + g \u2228 ).\n8\nwhich acts by the (co)adjoint action on weights\n\n7\n\n\fproduct\" [10], which amounts to discarding\n\n9\n\nthe representations with dimq = 0. This gives a\n\ndecomposition into irreps\n\u03bc\nD\u03bb \u223c\n= V\u03bb \u2297V\u03bb\u2217 \u223c\n= \u2295\u03bc\u2208P + N \u03bb\u03bb+ V\u03bc\n\n(4.9)\n\nk\n\n\u03bc\n\ninvolving only modules V\u03bc of positive quantum dimension. These N \u03bb\u03bb+ are known to coincide\nwith the fusion rules for integrable modules of the affine Lie algebra b\ng at level k, and can be\ncalculated explicitly. These fusion rules in turn coincide (see e.g. [13]) with the multiplicities of\nharmonics on the D-branes in the CFT description, i.e. primary (boundary) fields.\n\nWe conclude that the structure of harmonics on D\u03bb , (4.9) is in complete agreement with\nthe CFT results. Moreover, it is known (see also [13]) that the structure constants of the\ncorresponding boundary operators are essentially given by the 6j symbols of Uq (g), which in\nturn are precisely the structure constants of the algebra of functions on D\u03bb , as explained in [23].\nTherefore our quantum algebraic description not only reproduces the correct set of boundary\nfields, but also essentially captures their algebra in (B)CFT.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that branes D\u03bb which are \"almost\" degenerate (i.e. for \u03bb\nnear some boundary of Pk+ ) have only few modes \u03bc in some directions10 and should therefore\nbe interpreted as degenerated branes with \"thin\", but finite walls. They interpolate between\nbranes of different dimensions.\n\n5. Examples\n5.1 Fuzzy CPqN \u22121\nParticularly interesting examples of degenerate conjugacy classes are the complex projective\nspaces CP N \u22121 . We shall demonstrate the scope of our general results by extracting some\nexplicit formulae for this special case. This gives a q-deformation of the fuzzy CP N \u22121 discussed\nin [8, 9].\nWe first give a more explicit description of branes on SU (N ). Let \u03bba = (\u03bba )\u03b1 \u03b2\u0307 for a =\n1, 2, .., N 2 \u2212 1 be the q-deformed Gell-Mann matrices, i.e. the intertwiners (N )\u2297 (N ) \u2192 (N 2 \u2212 1)\nfor Uq (su(N )). We can then parameterize the matrix M (= L+ SL\u2212 acting on V\u03bb ) as\nM=\n\nX\n\n\u03be a \u03bba + \u03be 0 \u03bb0\n\n(5.1)\n\na\n\nwhere we set \u03bb0 \u2261 1. The \u03bea will be generators of a non-commutative algebra. The matrices \u03bba\nsatisfy\n\u03bba \u03bbb =\n9\n10\n\n1\ng ab + (dab c + f ab c )\u03bb\ndimq (VN )\n\nnote that the calculation of the Casimirs in Section 4.1 is still valid, because V\u03bb is always an irrep\nthis is just the condition on \u03bc discussed before (4.7)\n\n(5.2)\n\n\fwhere g ab , dab c and f ab c are invariant tensors in a suitable normalization, and trq (\u03bba ) = 0 (for\na 6= 0). We can now express the Casimirs cn (4.3) in terms of the new generators:\nc1 = trq (M ) = \u03be0 dimq (VN ),\n\n(5.3)\n\nc2 = gab \u03bea \u03beb + \u03be02 dimq (VN ),\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n\netc, which are numbers on each D\u03bb . An immediate consequence of (5.3) is\n[\u03be0 , \u03bea ] = 0\n\n(5.6)\n\nfor all a. One can show furthermore that the reflection equation (3.1), which is equivalent to\nthe statement that the (q-)antisymmetric part of M M vanishes, implies that\nf ab c \u03bea \u03beb = \u03b1 \u03be0 \u03bec .\n\n(5.7)\n\nOn a given brane D\u03bb , \u03be0 is a number determined by (5.3), while \u03b1 is a (universal) constant\nwhich can be determined explicitly, as indicated below.\n(5.6) and (5.7) hold for all branes D\u03bb . Now consider CP N \u22121 \u223c\n= SU (N )/U (N \u2212 1), which is\nthe conjugacy class through \u03bb = n\u039b1 (or equivalently \u03bb = n\u039bN ) where \u039bi are the fundamental\nweights; indeed, the stabilizer group for n\u039b1 is U (N \u22121). The quantization of CP N \u22121 is therefore\nthe brane D\u03bb . It is characterized by a further relation among the generators \u03bea , which has the\nform\ndab c \u03bea \u03beb = \u03b2n \u03bec\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere the number \u03b2n can be determined explicitly as indicated below. For q = 1, these relations\nreduce to the ones given in [8]. (5.8) can be derived using the results in Section 4.2: It is easy\nto see using (A.10) that\nDn\u039b1 \u223c\n= \u2295n (n, 0, ..., 0, n)\n\n(5.9)\n\nup to some cutoff, where (k1 , ..., kN ) denotes the highest-weight representation with Dynkin\nlabels k1 , ..., kN . In particular, all multiplicities are one. This implies that the function dab c \u03bea \u03beb\non Dn\u039b1 must be proportional to \u03bec , because it transforms as (1, 0, ..., 0, 1) (which is the adjoint).\nHence (5.8) follows.\nThe constant \u03b1 in (5.7) can be calculated either by working out RE explicitly, or by specializing (5.7) for D\u039b1 . We shall only indicate this here: On D\u039b1 , \u03bea = c\u03bba for some c \u2208 C. Plugging\nthis into (5.7), one finds c f ab c \u03bba \u03bbb = \u03b1 \u03be0 \u03bbc , and c2 gab \u03bba \u03bbb + \u03be02 dimq (VN ) = c2 . Calculating\n\u03be0 and the Casimirs explicitly on D\u039b1 , one obtains \u03b1 which vanishes as q \u2192 1. Similarly using\nthe explicit value of c3 given in Section 4.1, one can also determine \u03b2n . Alternatively, they be\ncalculated using creation - and annihilation operator techniques of [24], [23].\nIn any case, we recover the relations of fuzzy CP N \u22121 as given in [8] in the limit q \u2192 1. As\nan algebra, it is in fact identical to it, as long as k is sufficiently large.\n\n\f5.2 G = SU (2) model\nIn this section we shall show how one can recover the results of [7] from the general formalism\nwe discussed so far. The representation of the RE given by L\u00b1 operators and M (0) = diag(1, 1)\nis\n\n\uf8eb\n\nM = L+ M (0) S(L\u2212 ) = \uf8ed\n\n1\n\nq \u2212 2 \u03bbq H/2 X\u2212\n\nqH\n1\n\nq \u2212 2 \u03bbX+ q H/2\n\nq \u2212H + q \u22121 \u03bb2 X+ X\u2212\n\nLet us parameterize the M matrix as\nM=\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n!\np\nM 4 \u2212 iM 0 \u2212iq \u22123/2 [2]M +\np\niq \u22121/2 [2]M \u2212 M 4 + iq \u22122 M 0\n\n(5.10)\n\n(5.11)\n\n(cp.

The explicit value of M 4 = c1 /[2] is obtained\nfrom\nM4 =\n\n1 \u22121\n1 H\u22121\n(q a + q d) =\n(q\n+ q \u2212(H\u22121) + \u03bb2 X+ X\u2212 )\n[2]\n[2]\n\n(5.17)\n\nwhich is proportional to the standard Casimir of Uq (su(2)). On the n-th brane Dn , H takes the\n\u03c0\nvalue \u2212n on the lowest weight vector, thus M 4 = cos( (n+1)\u03c0\nk+2 )/ cos( k+2 ). If the square of radius\n\nof the quantum S 3 is chosen to be detq (M ) = k (which is the value given by the supergravity\nsolution for the background), gij M i M j leads to the correct formulae for the square of the radius\nof the n-th branes.\n\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper we propose a simple and compact description of all (untwisted) D-branes on group\nmanifolds G based on the reflection equation RE. The model can be viewed as a finite matrix\nmodel in the spirit of the non-abelian DBI model of D0-branes [5], but contrary to the latter\nit yields results well beyond the 1/k approximation. In fact, the model properly describes all\nbranes on the group manifold regardless of their positions. This covers an astonishing wealth\n\n\fof data on the configurations and properties of branes such as their positions and spaces of\nfunctions, which are shown to be in very good agreement with the CFT data. It also shows that\nM is a very reasonable variable to describe the branes. Our construction also sheds light on the\nfact that the energies of these branes are given by so-called quantum dimensions.\nThe branes are uniquely given by certain \"canonical\" irreps of the RE algebra, and their\nworld-volume can be interpreted as quantum manifolds. The characteristic feature of our construction is the covariance of RE under a quantum analog of the group of isometries GL \u00d7 GR\nof G. A given brane configuration breaks it to the diagonal (quantum) GV , an analog of the\nclassical vector symmetry GV .\nLet us also mention that the methods worked out in this paper might also serve as tools\ndescribing branes in RR background. E.g. it is known [28] that for G = SU (2) = S 3 the\ndynamics of branes is very similar for both NSNS and RR backgrounds.\nIt should be clear to the reader that the present paper does not cover all aspects of branes\nphysics on group manifolds. For example, we did not study all representations of RE, only\nthe most obvious ones which are induced by the algebra map RE \u2192 Uq (g). There exist other\nrepresentations of RE, some of which can be investigated using the technique in Section 3.4, some\nof which may be entirely different. One may hope that all of the known D-branes on groups,\nincluding those not discussed here such as twisted branes or \"type B\"-branes, can be described\nin this way. We plan to investigate this further in a future publication. Moreover, we did not\ntouch here the dynamical aspects of D-branes, such as their excitations and interactions. For\nthis it may be necessary to extend the algebraic content presented here, and the well-developed\ntheory of quantum groups may become very useful.\nThe paper has also an interesting mathematical side. The general construction of quantized\nbranes presented here yields immediately a variety of specify examples of finite (\"fuzzy\") quantum spaces, including CPqN . They may serve as useful testing grounds for noncommutative field\ntheories, which can be defined in a very clean way on fuzzy spaces, being finite. This should lead\nto further insights into the problems encountered recently on other spaces with star-products.\nSome work in that direction can be found for example in [24, 25, 26].\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank H.Grosse, B.

Appendix: technical details\nA.1 Some properties of Uq (g)\nWe collect here some definitions, in order to establish the notations. We basically follow the\n\u03b1 *\u03b1\n\nconventions of [19]. g is a simple Lie algebra, with Cartan matrix Aij = 2 \u03b1ji *\u03b1jj . The generators\nXi\u00b1 , Hi of Uq (g) satisfy the relations\n[Hi , Hj ] = 0,\n\n[Hi , Xj\u00b1 ] = \u00b1Aji Xj\u00b1 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\n[Xi+ , Xj\u2212 ] = \u03b4i,j\n\nq di Hi \u2212 q \u2212di Hi\n= \u03b4i,j [Hi ]qi\nq di \u2212 q \u2212di\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere qi = q di . Comultiplication and antipode are defined by\n\u2206(Hi ) = Hi \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 Hi ,\nS(Hi ) = \u2212Hi ,\n\n\u2206(Xi\u00b1 ) = Xi\u00b1 \u2297 q di Hi /2 + q \u2212di Hi /2 \u2297 Xi\u00b1 ,\n\nS(Xi\u00b1 ) = \u2212q \u00b1di Xi\u00b1 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nThe coproduct is conveniently written in Sweedler-notation as \u2206(u) = u1 \u2297 u2 , for u \u2208 Uq (g),\nwhere a summation is implied. It is easy to verify that S 2 (u) = q 2H\u03c1 uq \u22122H\u03c1 for all u \u2208 Uq (g),\nP\nwhere \u03c1 = 12 \u03b1>0 \u03b1 is the Weyl vector. This is used in the definition of the quantum traces\n\n(3.11), (4.4).\n\nA.2 The dual symmetries of the reflection equation.\nLet G and U be Hopf algebras. An algebra M is a (left) U -module algebra if there is an action\n\u22b2 : U \u00d7 M \u2192 M such that u \u22b2 (mn) = (u1 \u22b2 m)(u2 \u22b2 n) and (uv) \u22b2 m = u \u22b2 (v \u22b2 m) for m, n \u2208 M\nand u, v \u2208 U , where \u2206(u) = u1 \u2297 u2 . M is a (right) G-comodule algebra if there is a coaction\n\u2207 : M \u2192 M \u2297 G which is an algebra map and satisfies (id \u2297 \u2206)\u2207(m) = (\u2207 \u2297 id)\u2207(m). These\nare dual concepts: if G and U are dually paired Hopf algebras (see e.g. [19]), then a (right) G comodule algebra M with coaction \u2207 is automatically a (left) U \u2013 module algebra by\nu \u22b2 M = h\u2207(M ), ui\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere hm \u2297 a, ui = mha, ui, and vice versa.\nThis is exactly our situation: The Hopf algebra GL \u2297R GR (3.5) is dual to Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R ,\nwhich as an algebra is the usual tensor product Uq (gL ) \u2297 Uq (gR ), but has the twisted Hopf\nstructure\n\u2206R : UqL \u2297 UqR \u2192 (UqL \u2297 UqR ) \u2297 (UqL \u2297 UqR ),\nR\nL\nR\n\u22121\nuL \u2297 uR 7\u2192 F(uL\n1 \u2297 u1 ) \u2297 (u2 \u2297 u2 )F\n\n(A.5)\n\nwith F = 1 \u2297 R\u22121 \u2297 1. This is a special case of a \"Drinfeld twist\", which provides also a\ncorresponding antipode and counit (and R - matrix; for the general theory of twisting we refer\n\n\fto [15], and [19], Section 2.3). The dual evaluation h, i between GL \u2297R GR and Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R is\ndefined componentwise, using the standard dualities of GL,R with Uq (gL,R ).\nThe action of Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R on M which is dual to (3.4) then comes out as\n(ul \u2297 uR ) \u22b2 Mji = Mlk hS(sik )tlj , ul \u2297 uR i = \u03c0(SuL )M \u03c0(uR ),\n\n(A.6)\n\nas in (3.9). Moreover, there is a Hopf-algebra map u \u2208 Uq (gV ) \u2192 \u2206(u) \u2208 Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R where \u2206\nis the usual coproduct. This defines the vector sub-algebra Uq (gV ). It induces on M the action\n(3.10), which is again dual to the coaction (3.8).\nAt roots of unity, these dualities are somewhat more subtle. We will not worry about this,\nbecause covariance of the reflection equation under Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R can also be verified directly.\nA.3 The harmonics on the branes\nThe modes on C(t) (2.8)\nConsider the map\nG/Kt \u2192 C(t),\ngKt 7\u2192 gtg \u22121\nwhich is clearly well\u2013defined and bijective. It is also compatible with the group actions, in the\nsense that the adjoint action of G on C(t) translates into the left action on G/Kt . Hence we\nwant to decompose functions on G/Kt under the left action of G.\nFunctions on G/Kt can be considered as functions on G which are invariant under the\nright action of Kt , and this correspondence is one-to-one (because this action is free). Now the\nPeter-Weyl theorem states that the space of functions on G is isomorphic as a bimodule to\nF(G) \u223c\n=\n\nM\n\nV\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb\u2217 .\n\n(A.7)\n\n\u03bb\u2208P +\n\nHere \u03bb runs over all dominant integral weights, and V\u03bb is the corresponding highest-weight\n(K )\n\nmodule. Let mult\u03bb+t be the dimension of the subspace of V\u03bb\u2217 \u2261 V\u03bb+ which is invariant under\nthe action of Kt . Then\nF(C(t)) \u223c\n=\n\nM\n\n(K )\n\nmult\u03bb+t V\u03bb\n\n(A.8)\n\n\u03bb\u2208P +\n\nfollows.\nThe modes on D\u03bb and proof of\n\n(4.7)\n\n\u03bc\nWe are looking for the Littlewood\u2013Richardson coefficients N\u03bb\u03bb\n+ in the decomposition\n\u03bc\nV\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb\u2217 \u223c\n= \u2295\u03bc N\u03bb\u03bb+ V\u03bc\n\n(A.9)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\nof g - modules. Now we use N\u03bb\u03bb\n+ = N\u03bb\u03bc+ (because N\u03bb\u03bb+ is given by the multiplicity of the\n\u03bb ). But N \u03bb\ntrivial component in V\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bb+ \u2297 V\u03bc+ , and so is N\u03bb\u03bc\n+\n\u03bb\u03bc+ can be calculated using the\n\n\fformula [10]\n\u03bb\nN\u03bb\u03bc\n+ =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 mult\u03bc+ (\u03c3 \u22c6 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb),\n\n(A.10)\n\n\u03c3\u2208W\n\nwhere W is the Weyl group of g. Here mult\u03bc+ (\u03bd) is the multiplicity of the weight space \u03bd in\nV\u03bc+ , and \u03c3 \u22c6 \u03bb = \u03c3(\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1 denotes the action of \u03c3 with reflection center \u2212\u03c1. Now one can\nsee already that for large, generic \u03bb (so that \u03c3 \u22c6 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb is not a weight of V\u03bc+ unless \u03c3 = 1), it\n(T )\n\n\u03bb\nfollows that N\u03bb\u03bc\n+ = mult\u03bc+ (0) = mult\u03bc+ , which proves (4.7) for the generic case. To cover all\n\npossible \u03bb, we proceed as follows:\nLet k be the Lie algebra of K\u03bb , and Wk its Weyl group; it is the subgroup of W which\nleaves \u03bb invariant, generated by those reflections which preserve \u03bb (the u(1) factors in k do not\ncontribute to Wk). If \u03bc is \"small enough\", then the sum in (A.10) can be restricted to \u03c3 \u2208 Wk,\nbecause otherwise \u03c3 \u22c6 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb is too large to be in V\u03bc+ ; this defines the cutoff in \u03bc. It holds for\nany given \u03bc if \u03bb has the form \u03bb = n\u03bb0 for large n \u2208 N and fixed \u03bb0 11 . We will show below that\n(K )\n\nmult\u03bc+\u03bb =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 mult\u03bc+ (\u03c3 \u22c6 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n(A.11)\n\n\u03c3\u2208Wk\n\nfor all \u03bc, which implies (4.7). Recall that the lhs is the dimension of the subspace of V\u03bc+ which\nis invariant under K\u03bb .\nTo prove (A.11), first observe the following fact: Let V\u03bb be the highest weight irrep of some\nsimple Lie algebra k with highest weight \u03bb. Then\nX\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 multV\u03bb (\u03c3 \u22c6 0) = \u03b4\u03bb,0\n\n(A.12)\n\n\u03c3\u2208Wk\n\ni.e. the sum vanishes unless V\u03bb is the trivial representation; here k = u(1) is allowed as well. This\nfollows again from (A.10), considering the decomposition of V\u03bb \u2297V0 . More generally, assume that\nQ\nk = \u2295i ki is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras ki , with corresponding Weyl group Wk = i Wi .\n\nIts irreps have the form V = \u2297i V\u03bbi , where V\u03bbi denotes the highest weight module of ki with\nhighest weight \u03bbi . We claim that the relation\nX\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 multV (\u03c3 \u22c6 0) =\n\nY\n\n\u03b4\u03bbi ,0\n\n(A.13)\n\ni\n\n\u03c3\u2208Wk\n\nstill holds. Indeed, assume that some \u03bbi 6= 0; then\nX\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3 multV (\u03c3 \u22c6 0) =\n\n\u03c3\u2208Wk\n\n\u0010\n\nX\n\n\u03c3\u2032 \u2208\n\nQ\u2032\n\n(\u22121)\u03c3\nWi\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0011\u0010 X\n\n\u03c3\u2208Wi\n\n\u0011\n(\u22121)\u03c3i multV (\u03c3i \u22c6 (\u03c3 \u2032 \u22c6 0)) = 0\n\nin self\u2013explanatory notation. The last bracket vanishes by (A.12), since (\u03c3 \u2032 \u22c6 0) has weight 0\nP\nwith respect to ki , while V contains no trivial component of ki (notice that \u03c1 =\n\u03c1i , and the\n11\n\nThis constitutes our definition of \"classical limit\". For weights \u03bb which do not satisfy this requirement, the\n\ncorresponding D\u2013brane D\u03bb cannot be interpreted as \"almost\u2013classical\". Here we differ from the approach in [13],\nwhich do not allow degenerate \u03bb0 .\n\n\foperation \u22c6 is defined component-wise). Therefore for any (finite, but not necessarily irreducible)\nP\nk\u2013module V , the number of trivial components in V is given by \u03c3\u2208Wk (\u22121)\u03c3 multV (\u03c3 \u22c6 0).\n\nWe now apply this to (A.11). Since the sum is over \u03c3 \u2208 Wk, we have \u03c3(\u03bb) = \u03bb by definition,\nP\nand \u03c3 \u22c6 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb = \u03c3 \u22c6 0. Hence the rhs can be replaced by \u03c3\u2208Wk (\u22121)\u03c3 mult\u03bc+ (\u03c3 \u22c6 0). But\nthis is precisely the number of vectors in V\u03bc+ which are invariant under K\u03bb , as we just proved.\n\nNotice that we use here the fact that k contains the Cartan sub-algebra of g, so that the space\nof weights of k is the same as the space of weights of g; therefore the multiplicities in (A.11) and\n(A.13) are defined consistently. This is why we had to include the case ki = u(1) in the above\ndiscussion.\nTo calculate the decomposition (4.9) for all allowed \u03bb (with dimq (V\u03bb ) > 0), the ordinary\n\u03bb\n\nmultiplicities in (4.6) should be replaced with with their truncated versions N \u03bb\u03bc+ (4.9) corresponding to Uq (g) at roots of unity. There exist generalizations of the formula (A.10) which\n\u03bb\n\nallow to calculate N \u03bb\u03bc+ efficiently; we refer here to the literature, e.g. [13].\nA.4 The quantum determinant\nHere we present a formula for the quantum determinant, following [20]. First we have to introduce q-deformed totally (q)\u2013antisymmetric tensors \u03b5qi1 ...iN of Uq (sl(N )).\n\u03b5q\u03c3(1)...\u03c3(N ) = (\u2212q)\u2212l(\u03c3) = \u03b5q\u03c3(1)...\u03c3(N )\n\n(A.14)\n\nwhere l(\u03c3) is the length of the permutation \u03c3. The important formula respected by \u03b5q is (in\nnotation of (3.1))\n1\n\u03b51...N\nRi\u2032 = \u2212 \u03b51...N\nq\nq q\n\n(A.15)\n\nwhere Ri\u2032 = R\u0302(i+1) i and R\u0302ji kl = Rjk il . With this notation we define\n\u2032\nN 1...N\n\u03b51...N\ndetq (M ) = N (M1 R1\u2032 R2\u2032 ...RN\nq\n\u22121 ) \u03b5q\n\n(A.16)\n\nwhere N is an arbitrary normalization constant. One can show that this is invariant under the\nchiral symmetries GL \u2297R GR as in (3.4), or equivalently under the action of Uq (gL \u00d7 gR )R .\n1\n12\n\u2032\nFor N = 2 we have (M1 R1\u2032 )(M1 R1\u2032 )\u03b512\nq = \u2212 q M1 R1 M1 \u03b5q . After using the RE relations,\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\u22121\n1\nthis becomes proportional to \u03b512\nq times q (M1 M2 \u2212 q M1 M2 ) thus we choose the quantum\n\ndeterminant\ndetq (M ) = (M11 M22 \u2212 q 2 M12 M21 )\n\n(A.17)\n\nFor other groups such as SO(N ) and SP (N ), the explicit form for \u03b5qi1 ...iN is different, and\nadditional constraints (which are also invariant under the chiral symmetries) must be imposed.\nThese are known and can be found in the literature [20].\n\n\fA.5 Covariance of M and central elements\nFor any numerical matrix M (0) (in the defining representation of Uq (g)), consider\nM = L+ M (0) SL\u2212 = (\u03c0 \u2297 1)(R21 ) M (0) (\u03c0 \u2297 1)R12 .\n\n(A.18)\n\nLet M \u2282 Uq (g) be the sub-algebra generated by the entries of this matrix. First, we note that\nM is a (left) coideal sub-algebra, which means that \u2206(M) \u2208 Uq (g) \u2297 M. This is verified simply\nby calculating the coproduct of M ,\ni\n\nt\n\n\u2206(Mli ) = L+ s SL\u2212 l \u2297 (M )st .\n\n(A.19)\n\nIn particular if M (0) is a constant solution of the reflection equation (3.1), it follows by taking\nthe defining representation of (A.18) that [\u03c0(Mji ), M (0) ] = 0, and therefore [\u03c0(M), M (0) ] = 0.\nThen for any u \u2208 M \u2282 Uq (g),\n((\u03c0 \u2297 1)\u2206(u))M = (\u03c0 \u2297 1)(\u2206(u)R21 ) M (0) SL\u2212\n= (\u03c0 \u2297 1)(R21 \u2206\u2032 (u)) M (0) SL\u2212\n= L+ M (0) (\u03c0 \u2297 1)(\u2206\u2032 (u)R12 )\n= L+ M (0) SL\u2212 (\u03c0 \u2297 1)\u2206(u) = M (\u03c0 \u2297 1)\u2206(u).\n\n(A.20)\n\nIn the second line we used \u2206\u2032 (u) \u2261 u2 \u2297 u1 = R\u2206(u)R\u22121 , in the third line, the coideal property\n(A.19). Using Hopf algebra identities (i.e. multiplying from left with (\u03c0(Su0 ) \u2297 1) and from the\nright with (1 \u2297 Su3 )), this is equivalent to (1 \u2297 u1 )M (1 \u2297 Su2 ) = (\u03c0(Su1 ) \u2297 1)M (\u03c0(u2 ) \u2297 1), or\nu1 M Su2 = \u03c0(Su1 )M \u03c0(u2 )\n\n(A.21)\n\nfor any u \u2208 M, as desired. This implies immediately that\nu1 trq (M n )Su2 = trq (\u03c0(Su1 )M n \u03c0(u2 )) = \u03b5(u) trq (M n ),\n\n(A.22)\n\n[u, trq (M n )] = 0\n\n(A.23)\n\nor equivalently\n\nfor any u \u2208 M. This proves in particular that the Casimirs cn (3.11) are indeed central.\nA.6 Evaluation of Casimirs\nEvaluation of c1\n\nConsider the fuzzy D\u2013brane D\u03bb . Then c1 acts on the highest\u2013weight module\n\nV\u03bb , and has the form\nc1 = trq (L+ SL\u2212 ) = (trq \u03c0 \u2297 1)(R21 R12 ).\n\n(A.24)\n\nBecause it is a Casimir, it is enough to evaluate it on the lowest\u2013weight state |\u03bb\u2212 i of V\u03bb , given\nby \u03bb\u2212 = \u03c3m (\u03bb) where \u03c3m denotes the longest element of the Weyl group. Now the universal R\nhas the form\nR = q Hi (B\n\n\u22121 ) \u2297H\nij\nj\n\n(1 \u2297 1 +\n\nX\n\nU + \u2297 U \u2212 ).\n\n(A.25)\n\n\fHere B is the (symmetric) matrix d\u22121\nj Aij where A is the Cartan Matrix, di are the lengths of\nthe simple roots (di = 1 for g = su(N )) and U + , U \u2212 stands for terms in the Borel sub-algebras\nof rising respectively lowering operators. Hence only the diagonal elements of (SL\u2212 )ij are non\u2013\nvanishing on a lowest\u2013weight state, and due to the trace only the diagonal elements of (L+ )ij\nenter. We can therefore write\nc1 |\u03bb\u2212 i = (trq \u03c0 \u2297 1)(q 2 Hi (B\n\n\u22121 ) \u2297H\nij\nj\n\n)|\u03bb\u2212 i = (tr \u03c0 \u2297 1)(q \u22122H\u03c1 \u2297 1)(q 2 Hi (B\n\n\u22121 ) \u2297H\nij\nj\n\n) |\u03bb\u2212 i (A.26)\n\nHere H\u03bb |\u03bci = (\u03bb * \u03bc) |\u03bci for any weight \u03bc. Therefore the eigenvalue of c1 is\nX\nX\nc1 =\nq \u22122\u03bc*\u03c1+2\u03bc*\u03bb\u2212 =\nq 2\u03bc*(\u2212\u03c1+\u03bb\u2212 ) .\n\u03bc\u2208VN\n\n(A.27)\n\n\u03bc\u2208VN\n\nUsing \u03c3m (\u03c1) = \u2212\u03c1, this becomes\nX\n\nc1 =\n\nq 2(\u03c3m (\u03bc))*(\u03c1+\u03bb) = trVN (q 2(\u03c1+\u03bb) )\n\n(A.28)\n\n\u03bc\u2208VN\n\nbecause the weights of VN are invariant under the Weyl group.\nEvaluation of cn in general\n\nSince cn is proportional to the identity matrix on irreps, it is\n\nenough to calculate trq (cn ) = trV\u03bb (cn q \u22122H\u03c1 ) on V\u03bb , noting that trq (1) = dimq (V\u03bb ) is known\nexplicitly:\ntrq (cn ) = (trq \u2297 trq )((R21 R12 )n )\n\n(A.29)\n\nwhere the traces are over M at(N ) and M at(V\u03bb ). Now we use the fact that R21 R12 commutes\nwith \u2206(Uq (g)), i.e. it is constant on the irreps of VN \u2297 V\u03bb , and observe that \u2206(q \u22122H\u03c1 ) =\nq \u22122H\u03c1 \u2297 q \u22122H\u03c1 , which means that the quantum trace factorizes. Hence we can decompose the\ntensor product VN \u2297 V\u03bb into irreps:\nVN \u2297 V\u03bb = \u2295\u03bc\u2208P + V\u03bc\nk\n\n(A.30)\n\nwhere the sum goes over all \u03bc which have the form \u03bc = \u03bb + \u03bd for \u03bd a weight of VN . The\nmultiplicities are equal one because VN is the defining representation. The eigenvalues of R21 R12\non V\u03bc are known [27] to be q c\u03bc \u2212c\u03bb \u2212c\u03bbN , where \u03bbN denotes the highest weight of VN and c\u03bb =\n\u03bb * (\u03bb + 2\u03c1). Now for \u03bc = \u03bb + \u03bd,\nc\u03bc \u2212 c\u03bb \u2212 c\u03bbN = 2(\u03bb + \u03c1) * \u03bd \u2212 2\u03bbN * \u03c1,\n\n(A.31)\n\nhence the set of eigenvalues of R21 R12 is\n{q 2(\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd\u22122\u03bbN *\u03c1 ; \u03bd \u2208 VN }.\n\n(A.32)\n\nPutting this together, we obtain\ntrq (cn ) = cn trV\u03bb (q \u22122H\u03c1 ) =\n\nX\n\nq 2n((\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd\u2212\u03bbN *\u03c1) trV\u03bc (q \u22122H\u03c1 )\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere the sum is as explained above. Then (4.3) follows, since trV\u03bc (q \u22122H\u03c1 ) = dimq (V\u03bc ).\n\n(A.33)\n\n\fA.7 Characteristic equation for M .\n(4.5) can be seen as follows: On D\u03bb , the quantum matrices Mji become the operators\n(\u03c0ji \u2297 \u03c0\u03bb )(R21 R12 )\n\n(A.34)\n\nacting on V\u03bb . As above, the representation of R21 R12 acting on VN \u2297 V\u03bb has eigenvalues\n{q c\u03bc \u2212c\u03bb \u2212c\u03bbN = q 2(\u03bb+\u03c1)*\u03bd\u22122\u03bbN *\u03c1 } on V\u03bc in the decomposition (A.30). Here \u03bc = \u03bb + \u03bd for \u03bd \u2208 VN ,\nand \u03bbN is the highest weight of VN . This proves (4.5). Note that if \u03bb is on the boundary of the\nfundamental Weyl chamber, not all of these \u03bd actually occur in the decomposition; nevertheless,\nthe characteristic equation holds.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
