An important characteristic of these materials\nis the existence of several competing states, as exemplified by the complicated phase diagrams that transition\nmetal oxides (TMOs) present (Fig.1). The understanding of these oxides has dramatically challenged our view\nof solids. In fact, after one of the largest research efforts\never in physics, involving hundreds of scientists, even basic properties of the HTSC cuprates, such as the pairing mechanism, linear resistivity, and pseudogap phase,\nare still only poorly understood. In the early days of\nHTSC, it was expected that suitably modified theories\nof ordinary metals would explain the unusual properties\nof the cuprate's normal state. However, important exper-\n\nimental results gathered in recent years have revealed an\nunexpected property of oxides: Many TMOs are inhomogeneous at the nanoscale (and sometimes at even longer\nlength scales). This explains why the early theories based\non homogeneous systems were not successful, and raises\nhopes that a novel avenue for progress has opened.\nWhat are the implications of these and other results reviewed below? It will be argued that the current status\nof correlated electrons investigations must be considered\nin the broader context of complexity. In his pioneering\narticle [1], Anderson wrote that \"the ability to reduce\neverything to simple fundamental laws does not imply\nthe ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the\nuniverse\". In complex systems [2], the properties of a\nfew particles are not sufficient to understand large aggregates when these particles strongly interact. Rather,\nin such systems, which are not merely complicated, one\nexpects emergence, namely the generation of properties\nthat do not preexist in a system's constituents. This concept is contrary to the philosophy of reductionism, the\ntraditional physics hallmark. Complex systems spontaneously tend to form structures (self-organization), and\nthese structures vary widely in size and scales. Exceptional events are important, as when the last metallic link\ncompletes a percolative network. The average behavior\nis of no relevance for this phenomenon, and often only\na few rare events dominate. Evidence is accumulating,\nthat TMOs and related materials have properties similar\nto standard complex systems, and several results must\nbe reexamined in this broader framework.\nNanostructures in Manganites and Cuprates\nManganites: The Mn oxides called manganites [3, 4, 5,\n6, 7, 8, 9], especially those displaying the CMR effect,\nare an important oxide family in which the presence of\ninhomogeneous states is widely accepted. A remarkable\ncross-fertilization between theory and experiments has\nled to considerable progress in unraveling the role of these\ninhomogeneities. Theoretical investigations [4] predicted\nthat, in a broad region of parameter space, the ground\nstate is actually a nanoscale mixture of phases, particularly in the presence of quenched disorder [10, 11, 12],\nnamely, when random \"frozen\" deviations from the perfectly uniform system are incorporated in the study.\nMany experimental results are indeed in agreement with\nthe basic notion that the relevant phases are not homogeneous; these results also provide information crucial\nto understanding the CMR effect [4, 5, 13, 14].

(b) Generic phase diagram for\nHTSC. SG stands for spin glass. (c) Phase diagram of single\nlayered ruthenates [75, 76], evolving from a superconducting\n(SC) state at x=2 to an AF insulator at x=0 (x controls the\nbandwidth rather than the carrier density). Ruthenates are\nbelieved to be clean metals at least at large x, thus providing a family of oxides where competition and complexity can\nbe studied with less quenched disorder than in Mn-oxides.\n(d) Phase diagram of Co oxides [77], with SC, charge-ordered\n(CO), and magnetic regimes. (e) Phase diagram of the organic \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Cl salt [57]. The hatched\nregion denotes the coexistence of metal and insulator phases.\n(f) Schematic phase diagram of the Ce-based heavy fermion\nmaterials [51].\n\nof the general theoretical ideas are summarized in the\nschematic phase diagram (Fig.2a) [10], which has been\nexperimentally confirmed [15, 16] (Fig.2b).\nIn the clean limit without quenched disorder, the two\nkey competing states in manganites, ferromagnetic (FM)\nmetallic and antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating (AFI),\nare known to be separated by a first-order transition\n[4, 5]. However, once the inevitable quenched disorder\nis included in the calculation, arising, for example, from\nthe lattice-distorting chemical doping procedure, nonstatistical fluctuations of dopant density, or strain fields,\nthe region in which the two states are nearly degenerate (that is, they can coexist) is dramatically modified.\n\nIn this regime, there is still a local tendency toward either FM or AFI short-distance correlations. However,\nglobally, neither of the two states dominates (Fig.2c). A\nmixed glassy region is generated between the true critical temperatures, the Curie or N\u00e9el temperatures in this\ncase, and a remnant of the clean-limit transition, T\u2217 . In\nthis regime, perturbations such as small magnetic fields\ncan have dramatic consequences, because they only need\nto align the randomly oriented magnetic moments of preformed nanosize FM clusters to render the system globally ferromagnetic. A concomitant percolation induces\nmetallicity in the compounds. The fragility of the state\nshow in Fig.2c implies that several perturbations besides\nmagnetic fields should induce dramatic changes, including pressure, strain, and electric fields [4, 5]. Moreover,\nthe discussion centered on Fig.2, a to c, is independent of\nthe details of the competing states, and should be valid\nfor the AFI versus superconducting (SC) state competition in cuprates [17] and many other cases [18].\nCalculations that incorporate the effects of phase competition and quenched disorder have been able to reproduce the huge magnetoresistance observed experimentally [10, 11]; this suggests that the CMR effect\nwould not occur without either competing states or the\nquenched disorder and interactions necessary to nucleate clusters. This is in agreement with experiments for\nRe0.5 Ba0.5 MnO3 (where Re is a rare earth element) [16],\nwhich can be prepared both in ordered and disordered\nforms for the Re-Ba distribution. Remarkably, only the\nlatter was found to exhibit CMR (Fig.2d). This suggests that when phases compete, the effect of (typically\nsmall amounts of) quenched disorder results in dramatic\nproperties that are very different from those of a slightly\nimpure material [10, 11, 19, 20]. Disorder in the regime\nof phase competition is not a mere perturbation; it alters\nqualitatively the properties of the material.\nHow strong should the disorder be to induce the inhomogeneous patterns discussed here? Are there other alternatives? Studies incorporating long-range effects, such\nas Coulombic forces [21, 22] or cooperative oxygen octahedra distortions [11], suggest that very weak disorder,\neven infinitesimal disorder [21, 22], may be sufficient to\ndo the job. Calculations without explicit disorder incorporating strain effects [9], or within a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, also lead to inhomogeneous\npatterns [23]. While the discussion on the details of the\norigin of the inhomogeneities is still fluid, their crucial\nrelevance to understanding the manganites, as originally\npredicted by theory [4, 5], is by now widely accepted.\nCuprates: In the HTSC context, the La2\u2212x Srx CuO4\n(LSCO) phase diagram is usually considered as the universal diagram for cuprates. However, some investigations suggest otherwise [17, 24]. For example, only after\nCa is added to YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 (where \u03b4 is the excess of\noxygen, and it ranges between 0 and 1) does its phase diagram resemble that of LSCO [25, 26]. Moreover, organic\nsuperconductors do not have a glassy phase between the\nAFI and superconducting states, and they are believed\n\n\f3\n\nT\n\nT*\nFM\nglass CO/AF\nmetal\ninsulator\ng\n\nFIG. 2:\n(a) Generic phase diagram of two competing\nstates (here FM metal vs. charge-ordered antiferromagnetic\n(CO/AF) insulator) in the presence of quenched disorder\n[4, 5]. g is a generic variable to move from one phase to\nthe other (e.g. electronic density or bandwidth). A glassy\nmixed-phase state is created and a T \u2217 scale appears. (b) Experimental phase diagram of manganites with large disorder\n[15, 16].

Only the\ndisordered crystal has the CMR effect [16].\n\nto be cleaner than the cuprates [27]. This suggests that\nquenched disorder (or strain, etc.) in cuprates may play\na role as important as that in the manganites, and the\nexotic underdoped regime and T \u2217 may emerge as a consequence of its influence [17]. If so, then it is not sufficient\nto consider phase diagrams involving only temperature\nand hole doping x. A disorder strength axis should be\nincorporated into the phase diagram of these materials\nas well.\nConsiderable discussion concerning the existence of inhomogeneous states in cuprates started several years ago\nwhen stripes were reported in studies carried out with\nneutron scattering techniques [28]. These states had been\npredicted theoretically [29, 30]. The nontrivial real-space\nstructure of stripes emerges from Hamiltonians that do\nnot break translational invariance, which is a remarkable\nresult. However, since approximations were made in the\ncalculations, it is still controversial whether stripes do exist in Hubbard Hamiltonians [31, 32, 33, 34]. Experimentally, the presence of stripes is also a matter of debate.\nRecent neutron studies of HTSC materials have been interpreted as caused by a phase that contains stripes sep-\n\nFIG. 3: Examples of inhomogeneous states in HTSC materials.

In addition, doped Ni oxides and Nd-doped LSCOs\nare widely believed to have stripes [29].\nWhile the stripe debate continues, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) investigations have recently provided additional important information on the cuprates,\nunveiling a variety of other inhomogeneous states. Figure 3b shows a real-space distribution of d-wave SC gaps\nin Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (Bi-2212). The many colors illustrate the inhomogeneous nature of the state [38], with\nrandomly distributed nanoscale patches. These patterns\ncould be caused by phase competition or by a random\noxygen distribution. Other recently synthesized cupratebased compounds also have inhomogeneous states [39],\nand additionally, a new charge-ordered \"checkerboard\"\nstate has been observed (Fig.3c) [40]. This state also\nexists in Bi-2212 [41] and appears to compete with superconductivity. Understanding these novel states remains a challenge, but for our purposes two issues are\ncrucial: (i) When scrutinized with powerful microscopic\ntechniques, doped HTSC systems reveal inhomogeneous\nstates. Supporting this statement, a novel scaling law for\nthe cuprates was interpreted as produced by a Bardeen,\nCooper, and Schrieffer system in the dirty limit [42, 43].\n(ii) The intermediate states between the AFI and SC\nstates do not seem universal (they could have stripes,\na charge checkerboard, or glassy patterns). All these\ncharacteristics are hallmarks of complex systems, showing sensitivity to details, as it occurs in nonlinear chaotic\nsystems.\nSome additional issues should be remarked upon: (i)\n\n\f4\nWhile the most complex behavior in cuprates appears in\nthe underdoped regime, dynamic electronic inhomogeneity and competition among the many degrees of freedom\ncould also underlie the superconductivity even at optimal doping. Are the inhomogeneities and complexity at\nthe root of the superconducting phase, or are they unrelated? The discussion continues. (ii) Interactions can\nalso generate inhomogeneous patterns [17, 29, 44], and\nthe combination of these interactions with quenched disorder may be at the heart of the complexity in cuprates.\nAnother unexpected property of the cuprates is the\ngiant proximity effect. This phenomenon has a long\nstory, but recently it has been very carefully studied using atomically smooth films made of HTSC compounds\nin S-N-S trilayer junctions (S is for superconductor and\nN equals normal metal) [45]. The big paradox here is\nthat the trilayer behaves as a Josephson junction for\nN barriers a hundred times thicker that the coherence\nlength, \u03be. Then, the normal state can not be featureless, it must already contain a tendency toward superconductivity, which could be in the form of nanoscale\nSC islands [17] or phase-fluctuating homogeneous states\n[46]. This proposal leads to an exciting prediction: Under the proper perturbation, the state with preformed\nSC clusters should present a gigantic susceptibility toward superconductivity [17]. This is the analog of CMR\nin Mn-oxides, but translated into Cu-oxide language. In\ngeneral, theory predicts that giant responses to external\nperturbations should be far more common than previously anticipated.\nThe Case for Complexity in Correlated Electron\nSystems\nAre TMOs examples of complex matter? Considering the\ngeneral properties of complexity briefly reviewed in the\nintroduction, as well as the oxide results discussed in the\nprevious section, it is natural to wonder whether these\nsystems can be considered as special cases of complex\nmatter. While complexity is natural when associated\nwith soft matter (literally soft, for example polymers and\nliquid crystals), it seems out of place in the context of\nhard materials. But the several simultaneously active\ndegrees of freedom may conspire to provide a soft electronic component to transition metal oxide compounds,\nsoft not in the physical hardness sense but denoting the\nexistence of a multiplicity of nearly degenerate conformations of the electronic component that can be easily\nmodified by external perturbations. Conventional soft\nmatter is classical (h\u0304=0), but in the electronic systems\ndescribed here quantum effects are important.\nTMOs are soft in the sense described above as already\nproposed in the HTSC context [44]. They are also complex, because several effects become simultaneously important and prevent a simple physical description. More\nspecifically, consider one of the popular definitions of\ncomplexity recently discussed in [47]: \"... randomness\nand determinism are both relevant to the system's overall behavior. Such [complex] systems exist on the edge\n\nof chaos \u2013 they may exhibit almost regular behavior,\nbut also can change dramatically and stochastically in\ntime and/or space as a result of small changes in conditions.\" This definition is satisfied by manganites, in\nwhich a small magnetic field produces a drastic change\nin transport properties, and it may apply to underdoped\ncuprates as well [17, 45]. When phases compete, general\narguments suggest that large responses to weak perturbations should be far more common than previously believed [4, 5, 17]. Although the basic rules for electrons\n(i.e., the Hamiltonians) are deceptively simple (nearestneighbor carrier hopping, Coulomb or phononic interactions, etc.), the outcomes are highly nontrivial when\nphases compete and percolative physics, as when only a\nnarrow channel exists for electrical conductivity through\na material, is at work.\nAnother argument can be found in the known properties of traditional soft condensed matter, which is a phase\nof matter between a simple fluid and a regular solid crystal. In soft matter, large groups of atoms form regular\npatterns as in a solid, but when several of these large\ngroups are considered together a complex fluid behavior\nemerges. Typical examples are polymers: in each large\nmolecule there is atomic regularity, but an ensemble of\nthem have a variety of fluid phases [48]. This variable behavior is also present in some TMOs: in manganites, several experimental investigations have found evidence for\nJahn-Teller ordered small regions (i.e. with a particular\nform of lattice distortions) in the state above the FM ordering temperature [4, 5]. As a system, these small JahnTeller clusters, along with the magnetic clusters present\nin the same phase region, generate a collective behavior that is different than the behavior of the system's\nindividual parts, and in this temperature range colossal magnetoresistance occurs [4, 5]. Also cuprates may\nbehave as electron liquid crystals, intermediate between\nelectron liquid and electron crystal [44]. Softness in the\nmanganite context has also been recently discussed [23].\nOnce these concepts are accepted, then the long history\nof soft-matter investigations suggests that it is natural to\nexpect new kinds of organized behavior. In complex systems, randomness and determinism are simultaneously\nrelevant, and these are ideas compatible with recent correlated electrons investigations [10, 11, 15, 19, 20].\nEach complex situation in correlated electrons may\nlead to a unique state. Some materials may have stripes,\nothers may have patches, some may have phase separation at nanoscales, others may have mesoscale phase separation; the number of states in competition and their\nnature can lead to enormous possibilities. This is exciting for applications, but frustrating for those with a\nreductionist soul. What is likely is that new general concepts and paradigms will emerge as guiding qualitative\nprinciples in the study of complex oxides. It will be difficult to predict the precise shape of the nanopatterns\nand the phases in competition unless detailed calculations are performed. But the existence of some patterns,\nas well as giant responses to selected external perturba-\n\n\f5\ntions, will be predictable. Certainly the highest degree\nof complexity is expected when many degrees of freedom\nare active simultaneously, and when many phases with\ndifferent properties are in competition.\nTheory, phenomenology, computer simulations: How\ncan we make further progress in this context? Investigations involving the fundamental Hubbard and t-J\nmodels are reaching the limits of our current many-body\ntechniques. It appears unlikely that the large length\nscales needed to fully capture the complex behavior of\noxides, where percolation is probably very relevant, will\nbe reached via this path, and we must focus on the right\nlevel of description. As Laughlin and Pines [49] wrote\n\"Deduction from microscopics has not explained, and\nprobably cannot explain as a matter of principle, the\nwealth of crossover behavior discovered in the normal\nstate of the underdoped cuprates\". It is still reasonable that key issues such as the pairing mechanism and\nshort distance nature of the dominant states can still be\nanalyzed in the context of Hubbard-based approaches,\nperhaps supplemented by long-range Coulomb and/or\nelectron-lattice interactions. However, the complexity of\nthe resulting states, with emerging self-organization and\ngiant responses, can only be addressed with simpler phenomenological models that assume competition between\na few selected states, and analyze its consequences. For\nexample, the famous linear resistivity and puzzling underdoped behavior of the cuprates, and the CMR effect\nin the manganites may only be explainable using this\ncoarse-grain approach.\nThe logical chain starts with ab initio calculations to\nevaluate the main parameters and couplings, followed by\nHubbard modeling to obtain the dominant short-distance\ncorrelations, and ends with the use of more phenomenological models [17] to handle the long length scales of\nrelevance in an electronic complex fluid. The inclusion\nof both symmetry and spontaneous symmetry breaking\nwill be important to achieving these objectives, as will be\nthe inclusion of the effects of disorder and lattice distortions. Essential for the success of the present flurry of research in complex systems is the ability to use high-speed\ncomputers to perform unbiased calculations. By simulating a system made of many small units, the behavior of\nthe whole ensemble can be understood and manipulated\nmuch better than with other techniques, providing new\nways of learning and visualizing in this context.\nOther systems with similar complex behavior: There\nare many other materials that behave similarly as the\nTMOs emphasized in this review. For example, in the\narea of heavy fermions (metals where the effective mass of\nelectrons is much larger than the bare mass) the presence\nof \"electronic Griffiths phases\", inhomogeneous states at\nzero temperature, has been described [50], and strong\nsimilarities with the cuprate's phase diagram were unveiled [51] (Fig. 1f). In general, glassy behavior is expected near a metal-insulator transition at low temperatures [50, 52, 53], establishing an interesting connection\nwith the area of investigations known as \"quantum crit-\n\nical phenomena\" [54]. Glassy dynamics is also observed\nin other two-dimensional electronic systems [55]. Cobalt\noxides [56], organic materials [57, 58] (Fig. 1e), and Cadoped ruthenates (Fig. 1d) are other examples. Materials\nwhere charge density waves and superconductivity compete provide other cases of complex behavior [59]. The\narea of complexity in correlated electrons is far wider\nthan the two TMOs chosen in this article to focus on.\nComplexity in pure states: The emphasis of this review has been on self-organization and the complexity in\nthe electronic sector associated with the existence of several competing states. This corresponds to the physics of\nthe HTSC cuprates in the underdoped regime, and the\nmanganites in the CMR regime. However, complexity\nin strongly correlated electrons also exists in the fascinating ground states observed in the clean limit, or far\nfrom the region of phase competition if quenched disorder is present. For example, superconducting ground\nstates with zero electrical resistance, a Meissner effect,\nand unconventional properties (d-wave in the cuprates or\nspin-triplet pairing in the ruthenates [60]) emerge from\nsimple interactions among electrons and lattice vibrations. In the manganites, a CE phase exists with simultaneous spin, lattice, orbital, and charge order [4].\nThe list of exotic phases observed in the clean limit is\nenormous, and they all represent emergent phenomena\nin the sense that their properties cannot be predicted\neasily from the Hamiltonian. The collective behavior of\nelectrons in these phases is relatively simple, and it can\nbe described with a handful of concepts and parameters.\nThe emergence of simplicity is part of the complex behavior of electrons [49]. While in the case of Mn-oxides the\ninhomogeneities are crucial to understanding the CMR\neffect, and in cuprates the analogous inhomogeneities are\nimportant to rationalize the curious underdoped regime,\nthey do not provide an obvious mean to comprehend the\norigin of all the many exotic ground states. Thus, with or\nwithout quenched disorder, in homogeneous or inhomogeneous forms, it is clear that systems of strongly correlated\nelectrons are surprising and the list of their many possible ground states is far from fully classified. Research\nproducing highly pure samples is as important as those\nfocusing on the region of inhomogeneities and pattern\nformations, leading to complementary insight. Clearly,\nthese compounds are complex in more than one sense.\nApplications? It is too early to decide if the complex\nproperties of correlated oxides could be important for applications, but several results already provide interesting\nclues. To name a few, the resistance of some oxide films\nwere unexpectedly found to switch between low and high\nvalues upon the application of voltage pulses [61, 62].\nAlso, gigantic magnetoelectric effects were reported [63],\ninterfaces of magnetic oxides have been engineered [64],\nmanganites with sharp magnetization steps exist [65],\nand manganite nanotubes were prepared [66, 67]. Creating ultra-smooth thin films and artificial superstructures\nis part of the avenue toward applications. Since complexity appears to be the reason behind the CMR effect,\n\n\f6\ncomplex behavior is conducive to functionality. Relaxor\nferroelectrics are also oxides with nanodomains, with potential applications [68]. Field-effect transistors made\nfrom TMOs are another exciting area of research [69]:\ncorrelated electron materials could present phase transitions in the presence of electric fields since these fields\ncan alter the carrier concentration. It is the diversity\nof behavior, namely the many possible metallic, insulating, magnetic, superconducting, and ferroelectric phases\nof strongly correlated systems, that makes these types of\ninvestigations so exciting.\nConclusions\nTMOs are certainly not as simple as standard metals.\nThe many active degrees of freedom \u2013 spin, charge, lattice, orbital \u2013 interact in a nonlinear, synergetic manner, leading to an intrinsic complexity. STM, neutron\nand X-ray scattering, and other microscopic techniques,\nare crucial to unveiling the subtle nanoscale phase separation tendencies that induce a variety of real-space\npatterns. Charge transport in oxides is quite different\nfrom the free flow in simple metals: an isolated charge\nstrongly perturbs its environment, inducing a polaron,\nwhich often attracts other polarons to form larger structures. To capture this physics, it is important to incorporate several ingredients, including powerful nonperturbative many-body techniques, phenomenological approaches, and the effects of lattice distortions, strain, and\nquenched disorder. All these ingredients appear equally\nimportant. Phase competition rules the behavior of these\ncompounds: while the energies characterizing each phase\n(such as gaps) can be fairly large, at particular carrier\ndensities or bandwidths the energetic proximity of two\nphases introduces a lower hidden energy scale, and small\n\n[1] P.

R.\n\nperturbations cause huge responses, not via the melting\nof the state analyzed but by its replacement by a very\ndifferent one.\nEstablishing electronic complexity in hard materials\nas a fundamental area of research will create scientific\nrelations with other popular fields of investigations. For\ninstance, the existence of complexity in biological systems is clear, and analogies between proteins and spin\nglasses, both of which have a distribution of barrier\nheights among competing nearly degenerate states, have\noften been remarked upon [70]. In fact, most correlated\nelectronic systems exhibit exotic glassy behavior with notoriously slow dynamics [71, 72], establishing one of the\nprime connections between traditional biological or soft\nsystems and the complex states described here. Biological physics is one of the major frontiers for physics in the\nnew millennium and complexity certainly arises in macromolecules and complex fluids. A common language can\nalso be established with other broad fields: for instance,\nin nuclear matter the self-generation of structures is under much discussion as well [73].\nA novel paradigm involving \"complexity in correlated\nelectron materials\" will help to focus on the right level\nof description, on the expected emergence of patterns,\nand on separating the physics of the individual phases\nfrom properties that arise from phase competition. Controlling the spontaneous tendencies toward complex pattern formation may open the way to achieving emergent\nfunctionalities in correlated electrons systems. The enormous diversity of phases in oxides provides a wide range\nof combinations to explore. Complexity and functionality are rapidly developing into the most exciting frontiers\nin the active area of strongly correlated electrons.\n\nBishop, Phys. Rev. B 56, R8475 (1997).\n[15] Y.
