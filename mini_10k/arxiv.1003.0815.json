The achievement of large thermopower is a prerequisite to realistic applications in\nheat to electric energy conversion. Thermopower, among\nother thermoelectric properties, also complements the\nconductivity in elucidating mechanisms dominating the\ntransport processes[1]. Recently, thermopower of monolayer graphene, a peculiar two dimensional electronic system characterized by a Dirac like relativistic dispersion,\nattracts much attention from both experimental[2\u20134] and\ntheoretical groups[1, 5\u20138]. Calculations taking the effect\nof charged impurity scattering into account could explain\nthe experimental results very well. The experimentally\nobserved deviation from the Mott relationship at low carrier density is interpreted in terms of electron-hole puddle formation[1] and also by mixing of valence band and\nconduction band states by impurity scattering[7].\nBilayer graphene is another interesting material system displaying many unusual properties. Upon applying\nan external voltage, a semiconducting gap is induced in\nthe otherwise zero gap band structure[9\u201314]. The gap being tunable by external potential difference between the\ntwo layers introduces a new degree of freedom to bilayer\ngraphene. Up to now, there is neither experimental nor\ntheoretical work on thermopower of bilayer graphene. It\nis the purpose of this work to partially fill this gap by\ntheoretically predicting the behavior of thermopower in\nbilayer graphene systems.\nIt is established that charged impurity scattering is primarily responsible for the transport behavior observed\nin monolayer graphene[15\u201317]. For bilayer graphene,\nthe prediction in terms of charged impurity scattering\nis shown to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental result of the conductivity, and the opening\nof a gap in biased bilayer graphene is proposed to further improve the agreement[18]. In the present work, we\ntheoretically study the thermopower of gapped bilayer\ngraphene. We treat charged impurity scattering in terms\nof the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA)[7, 19\u2013\n21]. To ensure the applicability of SCBA, we restrict our\ncalculations to relatively clean systems with low impu-\n\nrity concentrations, where the localization effect is not\nsevere[22\u201324]. Thermopower as a function of carrier concentration is mainly calculated at room temperature. We\nalso study the temperature dependence of thermopower.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nWe consider a bilayer graphene system composed\nof two graphene single layers arranged in the Bernal\nstacking[25]. We start from a tight binding model incorporating nearest neighboring intralayer and interlayer\nhopping terms. An on-site potential energy difference between the two layers is included to model the effect of an\nexternal voltage. In the presence of impurity, the Hamiltonian consists of two parts: \u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124imp . Without\nof magnetic field or magnetic impurities, the two spin\nflavors are degenerate. We ignore the spin degree of freedom here and multiply the results by two for spin dependent quantities. The free part of the Hamiltonian is then\nwritten as\nX \u2020\n\u01240 =\n\u03c8k H0 (k)\u03c8k ,\n(1)\nk\n\nin which the vector of fermion creation operators is defined as \u03c8k\u2020 = (a\u20201k , b\u20201k , b\u20202k , a\u20202k ). a\u2020\u03b1k and b\u2020\u03b1k create \u03b1\nlayer states with wave vector k on the A and B sublattice, respectively. Up to nearest neighbor hopping, H0 (k)\nis written as[9, 25\u201328]\n\uf8eb\n\nV\n2\n\u2217\n\n\uf8ec\u03c6 (k)\nH0 (k) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed t\u22a5\n0\n\u03c6(k) = \u2212t\n\n3\nP\n\n\u03c6(k)\nV\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\nt\u22a5\n0\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\nV\n\u2217\n\u2212 2 \u03c6 (k)\uf8f8\n\u03c6(k) \u2212 V2\n\n(2)\n\neik*\u03b4j describes the intralayer nearest\n\nj=1\n\nneighbor hopping with strength t.

In this work, we take\n\n\f2\nt=3 eV and t\u22a5 =0.3 eV. V is the potential energy difference between the first and second layers induced by\na bias voltage. Since for every attainable carrier density, it is possible to find a bias voltage to make the\npotential difference between the two layers as V (when\nthe gap induced by V is experimentally reachable), we\nwould not consider the Coulomb interaction between imbalanced electron densities of the two layers and also neglect the dependence of V on the carrier density n in this\nwork[9, 10, 29\u201331].\nFor charged impurities, the impurity scattering part of\nthe Hamiltonian is written as[7, 19, 20, 32]\n\u0124imp =\n\nX\n\nVi (ri )ni =\n\ni\n\n1 X\nVi (q)\u03c1(q).\nV0 q\n\nk\n\nimpurity scattering amplitude Vi (q) could be written as\nvi (q)\u03c1i (\u2212q), where \u03c1i (\u2212q) and vi (q) are the Fourier\ncomponents of the impurity density and the electronimpurity potential, respectively. For charged impurity,\nvi (q) is taken as of the Thomas-Fermi type[1, 7, 20]\n(4)\n\n\u01eb is the effective dielectric constant from lattice and substrate, \u01eb=3 is adopted in this work[7, 20, 33]. d is the\ndistance between the impurities and the graphene plane\nand would be set as zero in the present work[1, 7]. qT F\nis the Thomas-Fermi wave number and is obtained from\nthe long-wavelength-limit static polarizability of the corresponding noninteracting electron system[1, 20] as\nqT F = 2\u03c0e2 \u03c7/\u01eb,\n\n\u03c1\u0307(r) + \u2207 * jN (r) = 0.\n\n(5)\n\n(9)\n\nThe momentum space version of the continuity function\nis\ni\u03c1\u0307(q) = [\u03c1(q), \u0124] = q * jN (q).\n\n(3)\n\nV0 is the volume of the system. The charge density opP \u2020\n\u03c8k \u03c8k+q .

The value of \u03c7 and thus qT F depends on both the temperature and the chemical potential.\nIn order to calculate the thermopower, we should first\nobtain the particle current and heat current operators\njN and jQ . They are obtained in terms of the continuity\nequation, which for the particle current reads[34, 35]\n\n(10)\n\nA similar relationship holds for the energy density hE (q)\nand the energy current jE (q).

Similar to\nfocus on the valley around K = ( 3, 1) 3\u221a\n3a\nthe monolayer graphene case, this could be achieved by\nintroducing an energy cutoff EC , such that only when\nthe smaller positive eigenenergy is less than EC would\nthe states labeled by the corresponding wave vector k be\nretained in our calculations[7, 19]. For experimentally\nrelevant carrier densities, EC is no larger than 1 eV. In\nthis energy range, \u03c6(k\u2032 ) could be expanded as a polynomial series in terms of the relative wave vector k = k\u2032 \u2212K.\nHere, we retain the expansion to the second order of k as\n\u03c6(k) \u2261 \u03c6(k + K) = \u2212t\n\n3\nX\n\nei(k+K)*\u03b4j\n\nj=1\n\n3t \u03c0 i\n1\n\u2243\ne 3 [ky a \u2212 ikx a + (ky a + ikx a)2 ] (19)\n2\n4\nTest calculations show that the exact dispersion around\nK could be excellently approximated by the above approximation up to EC \u2248 1.2 eV, so it is accurate enough\nfor our problem.\nIn terms of the approximate \u03c6(k), the velocity vector\nsatisfies q * (vk + vk+q )/2 = \u03c6(k + q) \u2212 \u03c6(k). The impurity scattering part P\nof the heat current operator could\nthus be written as V10\nVi (q)jN (q).\nq\n\nSince the particle current operator is the same as that\nwithout of impurity scattering, the linear response coefficient L11 could easily be shown to be[7, 19, 20, 36]\nZ +\u221e\nd\u01eb \u2202nF (\u01eb)\n[\u2212\n]Re{P11 (\u01eb \u2212 i0+ , \u01eb + i0+ )\nL11 = T\n2\u03c0\n\u2202\u01eb\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212P11 (\u01eb + i0+ , \u01eb + i0+ )}.\n\n(20)\n\nThe kernel is defined as\n2 X\nP11 (z, z \u2032 ) =\nTr{Gk (z)\u03931 (k, z, z \u2032 )Gk (z \u2032 ) * jk1 },\ndV0\nk\n(21)\nwith \u03931 (k) as the vertex function corresponding to the\nwave vector k.\nTaking into account of the relationship jk,q\n= 12 jk1 +\n1\n1 k+q\n, and following the same route as for the single\n2 j1\norbital model[36], it could be proved that L12 could be\nwritten into the following form [5, 7, 36]\nZ +\u221e\nd\u01eb \u2202nF (\u01eb)\n[\u2212\n]Re{P12 (\u01eb \u2212 i0+ , \u01eb + i0+ )\nL12 = T\n\u2202\u01eb\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n\u2212P12 (\u01eb + i0+ , \u01eb + i0+ )}.\n\n(22)\n\nThe kernel P12 is simply P11 multiplied by the energy\nP12 (\u01eb \u2213 i0+ , \u01eb + i0+ ) = \u01ebP11 (\u01eb \u2213 i0+ , \u01eb + i0+ ).\n\n(23)\n\nIn our calculations, the positive infinitesimal 0+ would\nbe replaced by a small positive quantity \u03b7.

In this\nwork, we would neglect the shift in \u03bc by the impurity\npotential. This is known as not giving rise to qualitative changes when the impurity concentration is not very\nhigh[7].

However, since only intravalley scattering\nis relevant for charged impurities[7, 15\u201317], we could focus on the low energy states within a cutoff energy EC\naround a single valley.\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\nIII.\n\nRESULT AND DISCUSSION\n\n-90\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nx(10 )\n\nt\u22a5 +V\n\nas an inset of Fig. 1(b).

The\nroom temperature (300 K) thermopower of clean monolayer and gapless bilayer graphene are presented in Fig\n1(a). Here and later, the abscissa index x represents\nthe electron doping averaged to per site, which could\nbe controlled by an external gate voltage[2\u20134]. x=0.001\namounts to an electron density of 3.82\u00d71012 cm\u22122 per\nlayer. For the monolayer system[42], a tight binding\nmodel up to nearest-neighbor hopping t=3 eV is used.\nPeak values of the two curves are almost the same, with\nthat of the monolayer slightly larger. When a more\nrealistic parameter t=2.7 eV is used for the monolayer\ngraphene[21], the peak position shifts slightly away from\nx=0, while the peak value keeps almost unchanged as\nabout \u00b183 \u03bcV/K. Besides the low carrier density peak,\nthermopower of gapless bilayer graphene shows a second\nsmaller peak at a higher carrier concentration. The onset of the second peak, for which the peak position corresponds to a chemical potential of |\u03bc|\u2243316 meV, is associated with the crossing of the chemical potential with the\nlower valence band (band top at -t\u22a5 =-300 meV) or the\nupper conduction band (band bottom at t\u22a5 =300 meV).\nWe now explore the effect of opening a band gap in\nthe clean bilayer graphene. Figure 1(b) shows the thermopower of bilayer graphene for a series of potential differences V between the two layers. With the increase of\nV , peak value of the thermopower increases quickly. For\nV = 1 eV (corresponding to an energy gap of approximately 288 meV, which is experimentally achievable[13]),\npeak value of the thermopower is about 412 \u03bcV/K, which\nis more than four times that of the value in monolayer\ngraphene and zero gap bilayer graphene. The much\nsmaller second peak shifts continuously to larger x as\nV increases and becomes irrelevant as V increases to 1\neV. Hence, we would concentrate on the region of low\ncarrier density in the following. The smallest energy gap\nbetween the conduction band and the valence band increases with V as \u2206 = \u221a V2 t\u22a5 2 [22, 43], which is shown\n\n150\n100\n50\n\n-400\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nV (eV)\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nx(10 )\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Room temperature thermopower as a function\nof carrier density for clean monolayer graphene (MLG) and\ngapless bilayer graphene (BLG). (b) Room temperature thermopower of BLG for a series of potential energy differences\nV between the two layers. Inset of (b) shows the evolution of\nthe global energy gap \u2206 as a function of V .\n\nIn the following, we focus on the biased bilayer\ngraphene system with V =1 eV. In Fig. 2(a), thermopower of this system is shown as a function of chemical\npotential (\u03bc) for three different temperatures. When \u03bc is\nat the band edge (\u223c \u00b10.144 eV), thermopower of all three\ntemperatures are nearly identical to each other. When\n\u03bc is inside of the band gap, |S| increases as temperature\ndecreases. While when \u03bc lies in the bands, |S| increases\nas temperature increases. This is similar to the corresponding behavior in semiconducting armchair graphene\nnanoribbons[42, 44]. The corresponding dependence of\nx on \u03bc is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). When x is very close\nto zero, |\u03bc| decreases as temperature increases. As |x|\nincreases beyond a certain critical value, |\u03bc| increases as\ntemperature increases. The above complex temperature\ndependence is a direct result of the existence of the band\nedge Van Hove singularities. From Fig. 2(a) and Fig.\n2(b), it is clear that for 100 K, peak value of S is achieved\nat a doping very close to zero. As temperature increases,\nthe carrier density for the peak increases continuously to\nlarger values.\nNow, we begin to study the effect of impurity. In this\nwork, charged impurity is considered as the only source\nof scattering for impure bilayer graphene.

In order to ensure that the SCBA is valid, we\nconsider only cases with small impurity concentrations.\nUp to a concentration of ni =5\u00d71010 cm\u22122 per layer, peak\nvalue of the thermopower increases continuously with the\nimpurity concentration. The peak position remains unchanged. In these relatively clean systems, the influence\nof localization[22\u201324] can be safely neglected.\nHere and later when impurity scattering is considered,\nan energy cutoff of EC =0.5 eV is used. Test calculations by increasing EC show no perceivable change in\nthe results for both clean and impure systems in the considered low carrier density region. For most energies,\nthe self-consistency for the Green's functions and vertex\nfunctions converge within 100 iterations with an accuracy of 10\u22125 and 10\u22124 for the modulus of every element,\nrespectively. For a symmetric band structure, as is the\ncase for both clean monolayer and bilayer graphene, thermopower is an odd function of the carrier density[1, 7].\nIn the presence of charged impurities, the electron-hole\nsymmetry of the band is preserved which could be seen\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n-3\n\n0.2\n\nx(10 )\n\n0.0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0 -3\n\nx(10 )\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Room temperature thermopower of bilayer\ngraphene for a series of different impurity concentrations with\nV =1 eV.

Insets of (a) and (b) show an\nenlargement of the corresponding low carrier density parts.\n\nby explicitly calculating the density of states. So we expect the relationship S(\u2212x) = \u2212S(x) survives. The full\ncurve for ni =5\u00d71010 cm\u22122 and T = 300 K is calculated\nexplicitly, verifying the above statement. To save computing time, for all other parameter sets in the presence\nof impurity, thermopower is calculated explicitly for the\nhole doped cases with x \u2264 0. The results for x > 0 are\nobtained through S(x) = \u2212S(\u2212x).\nThe Thomas-Fermi screening wave vector is shown in\nFig. 3(b) as a function of carrier density at 300 K and\n50 K for V =1 eV. At 300 K, as a result of thermal excitations, we get a finite qT F a\u22430.017 for zero doping. As\ntemperature goes down, the zero doping Thomas-Fermi\nscreening wave vector decreases gradually. As could be\nseen in the inset of Fig. 3(b), qT F (x = 0) is very close\nto zero at 50 K. This result is similar to the monolayer\ngraphene system and is different from the gapless bilayer\ngraphene, for which the zero doping qT F is finite even at\nzero temperature for the nonvanishing density of states\nthere[45]. The two peaks in Fig. 3(b) arise from the Van\nHove singularities near the conduction band bottom and\nthe valence band top, and are shifted to larger carrier\ndensities at higher temperature by thermal excitations.\nPrevious works[1\u20134, 7, 42] on monolayer graphene show\nthat impurity scattering is essential to reproduce the tem-\n\n\f6\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\nL11\nL12\n\n0.8\n\nT\n300 K\n50 K\n\nS(\u03bc V/K)\n\n200\n\n-5\n\nx=-3X10\n\nL\u03b1\u03b2/L\u03b1\u03b2(ni=0)\n\n400\n\nV=1eV\n\n0.6\n\nT=300K\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nni(10 cm )\n\n-200\n0.10\n\n(b)\n-2\n\nni(cm )\n\nx=0\n\n-400\n0.08\n\n0\n9\n5X10\n10\n5X10\n\nV=1 eV\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-3\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nx(10 )\n\n0.06\n\nDOS\n\n-1.5\n\nT=300K\n\n0.04\n\nFIG. 4: Thermopower of gapped bilayer graphene at 300 K\nand 50 K as a function of carrier density, for V =1 eV and\nni =5\u00d71010 cm\u22122 .\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n-0.4\n\nperature dependence of the thermopower observed experimentally. Thermopower of gapped bilayer graphene\nwith the same impurity concentration ni =5\u00d71010 cm\u22122\nare shown as a function of carrier density for room temperature and 50 K in Fig. 4. Results for x \u226510\u22125 are\nreadily obtained for both temperatures. However, for\nx at and very close to zero, only results for T =300 K\nare obtained within our calculation time. This is understood from Fig. 3(b) as a result of reduced screening at\na temperature as low as 50 K[7]. As temperature decreases, thermopower is suppressed and peak position of\nthermopower shifts slightly towards zero doping. These\nresults are qualitatively very similar to the experimental\nresults for monolayer graphene[2\u20134].\nA peculiar feature of our results is that the maximum\nvalue of S at room temperature increases with impurity\nconcentration ni , as shown in Fig. 3(a). By increasing\nthe energy cutoff EC and the number of wave vectors in\nthe Brillouin zone, we have verified that the above result is robust. In order to have a better understanding,\nwe show the variation of L11 and L12 for x=-3\u00d710\u22125 in\nFig. 5(a). It is clear that, both L11 and L12 decrease\nsharply as ni increases. However, the reduction of L11 is\nsomewhat larger than that of L12 . The increase of room\ntemperature S thus comes as a result of the stronger\ndependence of L11 on ni as compared with L12 . The reason why L11 decreases faster than L12 as ni increases is\nencoded in the integration kernels of the two linear response coefficients, Eq. (21) and Eq. (23). Eq. (23)\nshows that states above and below of the chemical potential contribute to L12 in opposite sign but of the same\nsign for L11 . Hence L11 is more sensitive to the variation\nof density of states (DOS) in the conduction band and\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 5: (a) Variation of L11 and L12 as a function of impurity\nconcentration for x=-3\u00d710\u22125 , normalized by the ni =0 value,\nrespectively. (b) Low energy density of states (DOS) for three\ndifferent impurity concentrations.\n\nvalence band due to the presence of impurities which is\nshown in Fig. 5(b) for two impurity concentrations at\nV =1 eV and T =300 K. In a previous theoretical work\non graphene nanoribbon[42], a similar increase of S with\ndefect density is also observed.\nWe now try to understand the doping dependence of\nthe shape of thermopower in the small carrier density region. From the definitions in Eqs. (16), (20) and (22),\nthermopower could be understood as the average value\nof (E \u2212 \u03bc) weighted by the combination of electron group\nvelocity (encoded in vk in the current operator and the\nrenormalized current vertex) and DOS [42, 46]. States\nabove and below of the chemical potential contribute in\nthe opposite sign to S. At the same time, the factor\n\u2202nF /\u2202\u03c9=\u2212nF (1\u2212nF )/kB T is substantially nonzero only\nin an energy range of several kB T centered symmetrically\naround the chemical potential. It is thus easy to understand that S tends to be larger once the DOS and (or)\ngroup velocity between states above and below the chemical potential have a big contrast[47]. According to this\npicture, when \u03bc is deep inside of the band (but still in the\nlow carrier density region), where the DOS is nearly flat\naccording to Fig. 5(b), the thermopower would be small.\nAs the chemical potential moves close to the band edge,\ndifference between states above and below of the chemical potential increases, which results in the increase of\nS. At finite temperature, when the doping is at or very\n\n\f7\nclose to the band edge Van Hove singularities, \u03bc would\nbe inside of the gap. In these cases, all states are high\nenergy states measured from \u03bc. Since S would be larger\nonce the higher |E \u2212 \u03bc| states contribute more to the integration, S is expected to continue increase for very low\ncarrier densities. As shown in previous works[42, 46], for\n\u03bc inside of the semiconducting gap, the most significant\npart of S comes from a term of the form\nS\u223c(\n\n\u2206\n\u2212 |\u03bc|)/eT,\n2\n\n(27)\n\nwhich clearly shows the increase of S as \u03bc\u21920 (or equivalently, x\u21920).\nThe above picture explains the initial increase of thermopower as |x| decreases. However, when the carrier density is very close to zero, the chemical potential also lies\nclose to zero energy. Hence, both the valence band and\nthe conduction band states are present by thermal excitations. Since the contributions to thermopower from valence and conduction band states are opposite in sign, the\nthermopower is expected to decrease at a critical carrier\ndensity characterized by the temperature[2, 3, 42]. The\ncritical |x| below which the magnitude of thermopower\nstarts to decrease is thus expected to increase with temperature. This explains the shift of peak position as observed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. In Ref. 7 on thermopower\nof monolayer graphene, the deviation at low carrier density from the higher density Mott's behavior [1, 46] is\nascribed to impurity scattering mediated coherence between the conduction and valence bands. According to\nthis mechanism, as impurity concentration ni increases,\nthe above coherence effect should enhance. So a shift\nof peak position with ni is expected. At 50 K and for\nni =5\u00d71010 cm\u22122 , the peak position is shown to shift\nfrom xC \u22430 to xC \u22432\u00d710\u22125. However, for 300 K, the xC\nshow no perceivable variation with ni up to ni =5\u00d71010\ncm\u22122 . A calculation beyond the SCBA is needed to know\nwhether or not the peak position for 300 K would shift\nfor much larger ni .\nIt is also interesting to ask why introducing a gap significantly enhances the thermopower of bilayer graphene.\nFormerly, a 'pudding mold' mechanism[47] is introduced\nto account for the large thermopower observed in Cobaltates. In that model, a band with a somewhat flat portion connected to a highly dispersive portion is proposed\nto give high thermopower when the chemical potential\nlies close to the bending point. Band structure of biased\nbilayer graphene is exactly of 'pudding mold' like[9, 47].\nSo the increase of S with V for a carrier density typically\nof x=\u00b10.001, for which the chemical potential lies inside\nof the band, is understood as resulting from the onset\nof the 'pudding mold' mechanism. However, peak value\nof S occurs when \u03bc situates inside of the band gap. In\nthis case, as mentioned above, Smax could be estimated\nby Eq. (27)[42, 46]. For V =1 eV, \u2206\u2243288 meV. For\nx=-3\u00d710\u22125 and T =300 K, the chemical potential \u03bc\u2243-40\nmeV, Eq. (27) gives a value of approximately 347 \u03bcV/K\nwhich is about 80 percent of the values in Fig. 2(a). So in\n\nthe present case, Smax is set by the energy gap \u2206, which\nincreases with V and is bounded by a limit, t\u22a5 [22, 43].\nHence, the large maximum thermopower in biased bilayer\ngraphene is mainly a result of the energy gap.\nTaking into account of the band asymmetry arising\nfrom the on-site energy difference between the two kinds\nof carbon sublattices, the band gap becomes asymmetric and the conduction (or the valence, depending on the\nsign of V ) band would be more flat[48]. However, since\nthe on-site energy difference derived from experiment is\nonly about 0.018 eV[48], we expect the above effect is\nextremely small and would not change our present result much. The interlayer hopping is estimated to be\nin the range of t\u22a5 \u223c0.3 \u2212 0.4 eV [49]. Our test calculation in clean system with t\u22a5 =0.4 eV for V =1 eV (with\nother parameters unchanged) gives a peak thermopower\nvalue of approximately 544 \u03bcV/K at 300 K, which is 132\n\u03bcV/K larger than the result for t\u22a5 =0.3 eV. So, the thermopower of gapped bilayer graphene is large regardless\nof the choice of model parameters.\nApplying an electric field to trilayer or other multilayer\ngraphene system, a gap could also be induced[30, 31]. For\ncertain parameters, the band structure is also of 'pudding mold' like[30, 31]. It is thus interesting to ask how\nthe peak value of thermopower evolves as a function of\nthe layer number. In this work, we have only considered\nthe effect of charged impurity scatterings. Recently, it\nhas been proposed that scattering by short-range disorder may also play an important role in the transport of\ngapless bilayer graphene because the screening of charged\nimpurities in zero gap bilayer graphene is much stronger\nthan that in monolayer graphene[18, 45]. Though we\nbelieve that the degree of screening in gapped bilayer\ngraphene should be much smaller than that in the gapless\nsystem, it is an interesting question whether the inclusion of short-range scatterers would change our present\nresults much. On the other hand, the regime of large impurity concentration or strong impurity strength deserves\nan explicit study in terms of a less severe approximation\nas compared with SCBA used above. We defer the above\nquestions to later studies.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have theoretically studied the thermopower of bilayer graphene. If a band gap of approximately 288 meV\nis induced in the system by an external bias, the room\ntemperature thermopower is greatly enhanced by a factor\nof larger than 4 as compared with that of the monolayer\ngraphene and the gapless bilayer graphene. In the presence of dilute charged impurities, peak value of the room\ntemperature thermopower is shown to increase slightly.\nThis behavior is analyzed in terms of the different dependence of L11 and L12 on the modification of density of\nstates by impurity. As temperature decreases, peak position of thermopower shifts slightly towards zero carrier\ndensity in the presence of dilute charged impurities.\n\n\f8\nAcknowledgments\n\nin the National Center for High-Performance Computing\nin Taiwan.\n\nWe wish to acknowledge the support of NSC 98-2112M-001-017-MY3.
