INTRODUCTION\n\nSMC X-1 is a high-mass X-ray binary system consisting\nof an X-ray source, a 1.6 M\u2299 pulsar, accreting from a 17.2\nM\u2299 companion, Sk 160 (Clarkson et al. 2003). It is also the\nonly X-ray pulsar for which no spin-down episodes have been\nobserved (Kahabka & Li 1999). The X-ray pulsar has a spin\nperiod of 0.71 s and an eclipsing orbital period of 3.89 days,\nand in addition it shows a superorbital variation in flux with\nperiod between 45 and 60 days. This is likely due to precession of a warped accretion disk (Wojdowski et al. 1998).\nThe presence of the accretion disk is likely to have significant consequences for the observed pulse profile. In Her\nX-1, a low-mass X-ray pulsar with a regular 35 day superorbital period, reprocessing of hard X-rays by the disk gives\nrise to a pulsating, soft spectral component (Endo et al. 2000).\nZane et al. (2004) have shown that the phase difference between hard and soft pulses changes as the accretion disk precesses. If similar reprocessing is at work in SMC X-1, as argued by Hickox et al. (2004), the pulse profiles should show\na variation similar to that of Her X-1. To that end, we have\nanalyzed pulse profiles of SMC X-1 in different epochs from\nChandra, XMM, and ROSAT. In \u00a7 2 we discuss the observations and our methods of data analysis. In \u00a7 3 we present the\nresults of our analysis, and in \u00a7 4 we consider the implications\nof our results and future work.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe observations reported in this Letter are described in\nTable 1 and were made with Chandra's ACIS-S in continuous clocking (CC) mode (CXC Proposers' Observatory Guide\nv5.0, 2002), the EPIC-pn detectors on XMM-Newton in full\nwindow (X101) and small window (X201) modes (XMMNewton Users' Handbook v2.2, 2004), and the ROSAT PSPC\ndetectors in pointing mode (ROSAT Users' Handbook 1996).\nWe shall refer to the observations as C104, X201, Rn00, etc.\n(see Table 1). Fig. 1 locates the Chandra and XMM observations in the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) lightcurve from the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) mission. We estimate the su-\n\nF IG . 1.- RXTE ASM lightcurve for SMC X-1 with arrows designating several observations. Quick-look results as provided by the RXTE/ASM team.\n\nperorbital phase (\u03c6SO ) as 0.16 for the Chandra observations,\n0.37 for X101, and 0.42 for X201, where \u03c6SO = 0 at the beginning of the X-ray high state. Given the variation in \u03c6SO ,\nthe uncertainty for these estimates is plus or minus a few days\nor \u03c6SO \u223c 0.05. The \u03c6SO estimates for ROSAT are unavailable\nbecause those observations were taken before the launch of\nRXTE.\nSince the CC mode provides only one dimension of spatial information, ACIS source events were extracted from\na source-centered rectangle of size 0.\u2032\u2032 492 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 968. Background events were extracted from two regions 0.\u2032\u2032 492 \u00d7 9.\u2032\u203284\nequidistant from the source. For X101, which shows the\nsource entering an eclipse, events were located within a circular region of radius 45\u2032\u2032 and extracted from the 4.9 ks of\npre-eclipse data; for X201, we used a circular region of radius\n51.\u2032\u2032 2. We ignored the XMM background because its surface\nbrightness was less than 0.1% of that of the source region.\nROSAT source events were extracted from a circular region of\nradius 2.\u2032 5. For Ra02, which shows an eclipse, events were\ntaken from the 5.5 ks of post-eclipse data.\n3.

(1998). The following analysis was performed with CIAO version 3.1 for Chandra and ROSAT data\nand SAS version 5.3.3 for XMM.\n3.1. Phase-Averaged Spectroscopy\nFor Chandra and XMM, we extracted phase-averaged spectra, modeling the 0.6\u20139.8 keV emissions with neutral absorption, a blackbody with kTBB \u223c 0.18 keV, and a power law.\nFor the XMM spectra we also included a high-energy cutoff\n(Ecut \u223c 6 keV, Efold \u223c 8 keV Woo et al. 1995). For Chandra and X201, we excluded the energy range 1.7\u20132.8 keV to\navoid instrumental effects (near the Au and Si edges) for high\ncount data (Miller et al. 2002). Although the excellent time\nresolution of CC mode prevents some photon pileup, we used\nthe ISIS pileup kernel for the Chandra observations (Davis\n2001), which show a pileup fraction of \u223c17%. For XMM we\nminimized pileup in the spectra by excluding events from the\ncentral one-third radius of the extraction regions.\nSpectral fits from C104, X201, and X101 are shown in Fig.\n2 and results are listed in Table 2. All spectra are dominated\nby blackbody emission below \u223c1.0 keV, athough the similar\nwavy residuals in the Chandra and X201 spectra below 1.0\nkeV suggest that the soft emission is not exactly blackbody.\nFor X101, the data are taken as the source is entering eclipse,\nand the spectrum could not be fitted using the simple model\nabove. Fixing \u0393 to a typical value of 0.9, we found that a\ngood fit is achieved by including a partial covering absorption, with a covering fraction of 88%. This accounts for the\nextra absorption by the dense gas around the star as the eclipse\nbegins, but allows for some X-rays to be scattered around the\nabsorbing region. Residuals suggest that there may also be Fe\nabsorption at \u223c6.5 keV, but more detailed spectral analysis\nis beyond the scope of this Letter. Since blackbody emission\ndominates below 1.0 keV, and power-law emission above 2.0\nkeV, we can use energy-resolved profiles in these ranges to\nexamine the variation of the separate components. More detailed analysis, using pulse-phase spectroscopy, will be presented in a forthcoming paper.\n3.2. Timing Analysis\n\nSince SMC X-1 is a fast-period pulsar, pulse profile analysis requires a time resolution of better than 0.71 s. Fortunately,\nthe Chandra, X201, X101, and ROSAT observations have sufficient time resolutions of 2.85, 6, 73.4, and 130 ms, respectively. We used efsearch in the software package XRONOS to\nmeasure the pulse periods (see Table 1). These are consistent\nwith the spin-up rate calculated by Wojdowski et al. (1998)\nand the periods determined by Vrtilek et al. (2001) from the\nsame Chandra data. We extracted high- and low-energy pulse\nprofiles from each of the seven observations (see Fig. 3).

Fluxes are for 0.6\u20139.8 keV. A distance of 60 kpc is assumed for the\nSMC.\n\nwe do not correct for pileup effects, since these have minimal\nimpact on the shapes of the pulses.\nAll seven observations show the double-peaked hard\npulse profile that has been thoroughly documented\n(Wojdowski et al. 1998; Paul et al. 2002; Naik & Paul\n2004). The soft profile, however, varies markedly. While\nearlier studies of SMC X-1 have shown a roughly sinusoidal\nshape of soft pulses (Paul et al. 2002; Naik & Paul 2004), the\nROSAT, Chandra, and XMM observations show a complex\nvariation of profiles. Although the ROSAT pulse profiles\nshow a single main soft peak, four of the five Chandra and\nXMM observations show double-peaked soft pulses.\nThe first ROSAT observation, Rn00, shows a single asymmetric hump at lower energies, slightly out of phase with the\nhard pulses. For Ra02, the soft pulses are lightly doublepeaked, although the poor spectral resolution of the PSPC\nplaces the exact details of the profiles in doubt. The X101\npulse profile shows a single broad peak quite similar to Rn00.\nIn the Chandra data, we see a clear second peak in all three\nsoft pulse profiles, and we note a significant phase difference\nbetween hard and soft pulses. In X201 we also find doublepeaked soft pulses, but these are almost in phase with the hard\npulses.\nFor Chandra and XMM we cross-correlated the hard and\nsoft profiles, to quantify the phase shift between the pulses\n(see Fig. 4), as in Ramsay et al. (2002) and Zane et al. (2004).\nThe Chandra profiles show strong anticorrelations at a phase\nshift of 0\u25e6 and positive correlations at \u00b190\u25e6 . We see multiple peaks because the hard and soft profiles each have two\npulses. Observation X101 shows a broad correlation with a\npeak at \u223c20\u25e6 ; in X201 we detect possible phase shifts of \u223c0\u25e6 ,\n\u223c \u00b190\u25e6, and \u223c \u00b1170\u25e6.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nF IG . 3.- Hard and soft pulse profiles for (a) ROSAT, (b) Chandra, and (c)\nXMM. The hard range is 2.0\u20138.0 keV (1.5\u20132.4 keV for ROSAT); soft is 0.5\u2013\n1.0 keV. Two pulse periods are shown for clarity. Note that the pulse phases\nshown are not absolute, but are only relative to each observation.\n\nIn these observations both hard and soft X-rays show pulsations, but differences in the hard and soft pulse profiles indicate a different geometric or physical origin of emission\n(Paul et al. 2002). Soft pulses in the most luminous X-ray pulsars are likely to originate at the inner edge of the accretion\ndisk, where hard pulses from the neutron star are reradiated at\nlower energies by disk gases (Hickox et al. 2004). If this picture is valid for SMC X-1, the observed blackbody component\nshould be consistent with emission from the inner disk. For\nreprocessing by a partial spherical surface around the neutron\n\n\f4\n3. The pulse profiles exhibit large-scale variations in\nphase relationship. Closely-spaced observations have\nrevealed identical phase shifts.\n\nF IG . 4.- Cross-correlation between hard and soft pulse profiles for Chandra and XMM data.\n\nstar, the blackbody radius RBB is given by (Paul et al. 2002)\ns\nLX\nRBB =\n.\n4\n4\u03c0\u03c3TBB\nUsing kTBB \u223c 0.18 keV and LX \u223c 4 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 , we have\nRBB \u223c 1.7\u00d7108 cm.\nIn the standard model for X-ray pulsars, the inner disk radius R0 is close to the magnetospheric radius Rm , where the\nmagnetic pressure of the dipole field equals the ram pressure\nof the infalling gas. However, Rm is difficult to estimate for\nSMC X-1, because the surface B-field has not been directly\nmeasured. We note that RBB is close to the corotation radius Rcor = (GMP2 /4\u03c0 2 )1/3 \u2243 1.3 \u00d7 108 cm, which is another\nestimate for R0 . However, the lack of spin-down episodes\nfor SMC X-1 suggests that R0 < Rcor (Kahabka & Li 1999).\nThe situation is therefore unclear, but without additional constraints it is certainly possible that the soft pulses originate at\nthe inner accretion disk.\nIn light of this picture we consider the following pulse profile characteristics:\n1. The hard pulse profile is consistently double-peaked,\ntypically with one dominant peak.\n2. The soft pulse profile varies in shape, and has been\nobserved with either a single asymmetric peak or two\npeaks with varying degrees of symmetry.\n\nZane et al. (2004) suggest that the varying hard-soft phase\nshift in Her X-1 may be due to the precession of the accretion disk, so we consider the possibility that such a disk could\nreproduce the above characteristics in SMC X-1. If the observational line of sight is sufficiently close to the plane of the\nmagnetic axis, we might always see two hard pulses, one from\neach magnetic pole. However, the soft profile could change\ndramatically in shape and relative phase, as observed, if precession of the disk causes the visible part of the reprocessing\nregion to vary.\nWe note however that we cannot conclusively verify this\npicture and its analogy to Her X-1. First, we lack sufficient\nsampling of the full 60 day superorbital period. Second, the\nhard-soft phase shift appears to vary more rapidly for SMC\nX-1 (a change of \u224390\u25e6 between \u03c6SO \u2243 0.16 and 0.42) than\nfor Her X-1 (\u224320\u25e6 between \u03c6SO \u2243 0.03 and 0.17 Zane et al.\n2004). Third, it is not completely clear even in Her X-1 that\nthe phase variation is caused by the 35 day disk precession;\nsoon after the observations of Zane et al. (2004), the source\nentered an anomalous low state, an event that may be caused\nby changes in the inner disk structure (Boyd & Still 2004;\nOosterbroek et al. 2001). Such changes could alter the shape\nof the inner reprocessing region, and thus the soft profiles, in\na way that is not directly related to the superorbital period.\nWe conclude that in SMC X-1, we have observed variations\nin the soft pulse profile that likely reflect changes in the reprocessing of hard X-rays by the accreting gas. These variations\nmay be related to the superorbital precession of the accretion\ndisk, as has been proposed for Her X-1. If it can be shown\nwith more observations that the pulse profiles and superorbital period are correlated, then we will have the opportunity\nto apply significant constraints to the geometry of SMC X-1.\n\nWe thank Cara Rakowski, John Houck, Craig Heinke,\nJonathan McDowell, and Patrick Wojdowski for helpful discussions and the referee for useful comments.
