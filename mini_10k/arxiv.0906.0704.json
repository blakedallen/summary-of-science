A very interesting situation occurs when\none considers two qubits and their entangling properties:\nif the qubits are coupled to two different (uncorrelated)\nbaths, qualitatively new effects, known as sudden death\nof entanglement phenomena, have been found to occur [2,\n3,4]. These effects, already confirmed experimentally [5],\ninclude the non-exponential decay of concurrence [2] and\nthe nonadditivity of decay rates [3]. It has been shown\nthat these sudden death effects becomes more pronounced\nat finite temperature [6] and in the presence of external\ndriving [7]. Such systems have attracted considerable interest amongst various research communities, due to the\nfact that the entangling effects predicted are fundamental\nand generic - in the sense that they do not depend on a\nspecific experimental realization.\nMuch of the nonituitive character of the sudden death\nof entanglement comes from the fact that the system is bipartite and, although it is subject only to local interactions\n(acting separately on each of the two subsystems), one\nproperty (entanglement) which characterizes the whole\nsystem, has a dynamics which cannot be understood qualitatively as just the addition of local effects. There are\nalso practical consequences to the sudden death effect: for\nthe research effort into building a quantum computer, it\nimplies that it could be more difficult to maintain entanglement when the qubits interact with different reservoirs\nand are locally driven by single-qubit quantum gates. In\nthis context, also qubit-qubit interactions must be consid-\n\nered: in quantum networks such as those realized nowadays with superconducting quantum circuits these interactions can appear while performing two-qubit gates or simply by spurious cross-coupling. This qubit-qubit coupling\nis established either directly, through mutual inductances\nand capacitances [8], or as second-order effects, due to the\ncreation of virtual excitations in the common environment\nor in the quantum buses needed in a typical architecture of\na quantum processor [9]. Finally, in the presence of driving\nand of two different reservoirs, the qubit-qubit interaction\nleads to another entanglement effect called steady-state\ngeneration of entanglement, a phenomenon which has attracted considerable attention [10]. In contrast, transient\nentanglement effects that occur as shorter timescales in\nsuch systems have not yet been studied systematically.\nMuch like in the case of steady-state entanglement, we\nwill see that the interesting effects occur only when driving, coupling, and decoherence are present at the same\ntime. However, we should mention that the steady-state\ngeneration of entanglement appears in a completely different region of the parameter space, in which the secular\napproximation is not valid: for the parameter values considered here, the steady state is not entangled.\nIn this paper, we investigate a system consisting of two\nqubits, dissipating in two different reservoirs, driven at\nresonance, and coupled by a dipole-dipole interaction. We\nstudy the entanglement dynamics of initial states of \"X\"type, that is, 4 \u00d7 4 density matrices in which the nonzero\nelements have the shape of the letter \"X\". As we will see,\nunder unitary evolution and in the secular approximation\nthese states are mapped also into X-type states and finding analytical solutions is possible. For the states investigated, the dynamics occurs at timescales below the inverse\nof the longitudinal decoherence rate \u2013 the states become\nseparable after a time of sudden death tESD . Bipartite\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Li and G. S. Paraoanu: Decay of entanglement in coupled, driven systems with bipartite decoherence\n\ndecoherence is truly a requirement: for a single reservoir,\nthe decay would be exponential, which would make any\ndiagram of tESD featureless. As it turns out, the three\nprocesses present in the problem - driving, coupling, and\ndecoherence - combine into a non-trivial time evolution\nin the interval t \u2208 [0, tESD ] resulting in an unexpectedly\nrich dependence of tESD on the initial state and on the\ncoupling strength.\nWe consider two qubits of energy separation (Larmor\nfrequency) \u03c9jL , and driven by two classical radiation fields\nof frequencies \u03c9j which are coupled to the \u03c3 x -Pauli matrices of the qubits with dipole-field strengths (Rabi frequencies) \u03a9j . The qubits are also dipole-dipole coupled to each\nother, a generic interaction which appears as such in many\nexperimentally-relevant contexts [8,9]. In the Schr\u00f6dinger\npicture we write for this part of the Hamiltonian\nHcoup = \u03c9 xx \u03c31x \u03c32x + \u03c9 yy \u03c31y \u03c32y ,\nxx\n\n(1)\n\nyy\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03c9 denotes the X-X and Y-Y coupling\nstrengths, respectively. The total Hamiltonian of the system is therefore\nX\nX \u03c9jL\n\u03a9j cos(\u03c9j t)\u03c3jx + Hcoup (2)\n\u03c3jz +\nHsys =\n2\nj=1,2\nj=1,2\nFor the environment, we consider a longitudinal (amplitude damping) reservoir at zero temperature. Under the\nusual assumptions of Markovian evolution with respect to\nthe environment degrees of freedom [1], and at zero temperature, the dynamical evolution of the qubits' density\noperator (in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture) \u03c1S is governed by\nthe Born-Markov master equation\n\u03c1\u0307S = \u2212i[Hsys , \u03c1S ] + L[\u03c1S ],\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the resulting Liouvillean superoperator L is the sum\nof the longitudinal dampings of the two qubits with energy\nrelaxation rates \u0393j , respectively,\nX \u0393j\n\u0001\nL[\u03c1S ] =\n2\u03c3j\u2212 \u03c1S \u03c3j+ \u2212 \u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212 \u03c1S \u2212 \u03c1S \u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212 (4)\n2\nj=1,2\n\nWe note here that we have implicitly used the typical assumption (largely satisfied for many experimental\nsystems) that the energy relaxation rates \u0393j have a mild,\nnegligible variation with frequency over a bandwidth of\nthe order of \u03a9j around the Larmor frequencies of the\nqubits (or, leading to the same conclusion, one assumes\nthat driving is weak with respect to the Larmor frequencies). We then move to a rotating frame using the transformation R = exp[i(\u03c91 \u03c31z + \u03c92 \u03c32z )t/2] and the identities\nR\u2020 \u03c3j\u00b1 R = \u03c3j\u00b1 exp(\u2213i\u03c9j t) with j = 1, 2, and also employing the rotating-wave approximation to eliminate the relatively faster counter-rotating terms,\n\u03c1\u0307rf = \u2212i[Hrf , \u03c1rf ] + L[\u03c1rf ],\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03c1rf = R\u03c1S S \u2020 , and\n\n\u2202R \u2020\nHrf = RHsys R\u2020 + i\nR\n(6)\n\u2202t\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u03b4j\n\u03c9c x x\n\u03a9j x\n\u2248\n\u03c3jz +\n\u03c3j +\n(\u03c31 \u03c32 + \u03c31y \u03c32y ) . (7)\n2\n2\n2\nj=1,2\n\nHere \u03b4j = \u03c9jL \u2212 \u03c9j is the detuning of the qubit transition frequency from the driving frequency and \u03c9c is the\neffective coupling frequency (in the rotating wave approximation) \u03c9c = \u03c9 xx + \u03c9 yy .\nEq. (7) can be solved numerically and we will present\nsuch results below. As it turns out, the data from numerical simulations will display qualitative differences for\ndifferent initial states, and just the numerical result would\nbe unsatisfactory. It is in principle possible to solve analytically Eq. (7): unfortunately the structure of even relatively general forms of the density matrices (such as the\n\"X\"-form, see below) is not left invariant under evolution\nwith Eq. (7), and the results are very complicated. To\nmake progress, further simplifications are necessary. Below we will use the secular approximation, which is valid\nfor most of the interesting experimental situations when\ntypically the Rabi frequency is much larger than the energy relaxation rate, and we show that relatively easy to\nhandle analytical results can be derived.\n\n2 Secular approximation for driven, coupled\nqubits\nIn the rest of this paper we will analyze the case of onresonance driving (\u03b4j = 0) and identical Rabi frequencies\n\u03a9j = \u03a9.

Otherwise, for larger values of \u03a9,\nthe secular approximation gives results indistinguishable\nfrom numerical simulations.\nFrom now on, we introduce the standard (exponential)\ndecay amplitude \u03b7(t) = exp(\u2212\u0393 t/2), 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1, a notation which will be used throughout the remaining sections\nof the paper.\n\n3 Werner states\n\n\u2212\u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3j\u2212 \u03c3j+ \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212 \u2212 \u03c1\u03c3j\u2212 \u03c3j .

Werner states with fidelity f \u2264 1/2 are\nseparable; for f > 1/2 they have a concurence of 2f \u2212 1.\nAt zero driving and zero coupling, it is known that there is\nsudden death only in the region f \u2264 0.714 and exponential\ndecay for f > 0.714 [4]. In the case of finite driving, it has\nbeen shown that Werner states will all decay by sudden\ndeath, as a consequence of the fact that driving modifies\nthe structure of the decay Liouvillean [7]. As we will see\nbelow, also in the case in which both the coupling and the\ndriving are non-zero, this property remains valid, and all\nthe states decay by sudden death.\nFor the Werner state, Eq. (13) has the solution\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n3 + (1 \u2212 4f )\u03b7 3 (t) ,\na(t) = d(t) =\n12\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nb(t) = c(t) =\n3 + (4f \u2212 1)\u03b7 3 (t) ,\n12\n4f \u2212 1 2\n\u03b7 (t) [1 + \u03b7(t)] ,\nz(t) =\n12\n4f \u2212 1 3\n\u03b7 (t) [1 \u2212 \u03b7(t)] .\nw(t) = \u2212\n12\nThis solution is independent of the qubit-qubit coupling\n\u03c9c , which means that the enhancement of entanglement\nsudden death is also independent of \u03c9c . This is confirmed\nnumerically in Fig. 1, where we present also a typical time\nevolution with finite qubit-qubit coupling for these states.\nWe then obtain the following results for the expression\nappearing in the formula for the concurrence of X-states,\nEq.

Li and G. S. Paraoanu: Decay of entanglement in coupled, driven systems with bipartite decoherence\n\nEq. (16) is negative for all values of f , therefore the\nconcurrence is determined by Eq. (15): all the states with\nf \u2265 1/2 display sudden death due to the fact that the\nequation F (t) = 0 has one real root. For example, the\nmaximally entangled state f = 1 has a sudden death time\nts \u2248 0.84/\u0393 .\n\n0.1\n\ncoupling all the YE states decay by sudden death [7], and\nthis feature is preserved also in the case of both nonzero\ncoupling and driving, as we will see below.\nWith this initial state, the solution of Eq.

These\nstates start with nonzero entanglement, which decays to\nzero in an time tESD shown in the parameter space s \u2212 \u03c9c\nin Fig. 3. However, unlike the diagonal states that we will\nanalyze below, the YE state displays only very mild delayed birth of of entanglement phenomena at very large\n\u03c9c /\u0393 . For moderate values of \u03c9c /\u0393 , the transitions resulting in the lobs of Fig. 3 are smooth.\n\n5 Diagonal states\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03b1 takes values in the interval [0, 1].\nIn the case of zero coupling and zero driving it has\nbeen shown [2] that only the states with \u03b1 > 1/3 suffer sudden death on entanglement, while the states with\n\u03b1 < 1/3 decay exponentially. For finite driving and zero\n\nAn important class of states are the diagonal states, of\nwhich we consider two subclasses, namely states that are\ndiagonal on a subspace of single excitations (i.e. only one\nquanta is present initially in the system), and states which\nare diagonal in the subspace with zero and two excitations.\nSince g and e are typically used as indices for ground, respectively excited states, we will call \u03c1eg\u2212ge the first class\nof states and \u03c1ee\u2212gg the second class. Both these states\nhave zero initial entanglement: as we will see however, a\nfinite concurrence is acquired during the short-term evolution and decays in a finite time afterwards.\n\n\fJ. Li and G.

The physical picture that\nthese states correspond to is the following: suppose we\nhave two identical qubits, each with its own source of dissipation. We excite one of them by a fast \u03c0 pulse (fast\ncompared to \u0393 ) and then we allow them to interact with\na coupling strength \u03c9c . For example, with quantum superconducting circuits this type of initial state is realized\nin most experiments [8,9].\nIn the absence of dissipation we would expect the transferring back and forth of a single quanta of excitation between the two qubits, with periodic creation of entanglement due to coupling. The dynamics of the system would\nexplore only the subspace spanned by |01i and |10i, having\nat times components on the maximally\nentangled Bell sin\u221a\nglet states |\u03a8 \u00b1 i = (|01i \u00b1 |10i)/ 2. As we will see below,\nin the presence of dissipation and driving, this periodic\nprocess is still present, and if it is faster than the decay\nrate it leads to periodic creation and extinction of entanglement, as the concurrence competes with the effect of\nthe environmental noise.

We already\nknow what happens when coupling is not present, as most\nof the literature on the topic of sudden death of entanglement studies this situation. But then, if we have coupling, isn't it the case that this will produce anyway some\nform of entanglement \u2013 then, does the driving play in fact\nany role in the emergence of the structures for tESD presented above? The answer is yes. As pointed out already\nthroughout this paper, the existence of the type of effects\npresented in this paper depends on all three ingredients:\ndriving, coupling, and bipartite dissipation. Note that bipartite reservoirs are indeed needed: in the case of a single\nreservoir, the decay is exponential and tESD is infinite.\nIndeed, if one takes the master equation Eq. (5) and\nsimulates the evolution with \u03a9 = 0, the corresponding\ndiagrams have no interesting features: there is, somewhat\nsurprisingly, no dependence of tESD on \u03c9xx , so none of the\ndiagrams would be obtained (with the exception of that\nfor Werner states, which has the special property of \u03c9xx independence even at finite driving).\nIn the following we summarize the results obtained\nby numerical simulations for the no-driving situation. To\nmake the discussion more general, we will introduce also\ntemperature in the problem,\n(th)\n\nLj\n\n[\u03c1] =\n\n0.3\n\n(26)\n\nwhich describes again an oscillatory process overlapping\nwith decay. As in the analysis before, tESD will display\nrevivals of entanglement with period 2\u03c0/\u03c9c , a statement\nthat we have also checked numerically. In Fig. 6 we show\nthe corresponding diagram of tESD in the s\u2212\u03c9c parameter\nspace. As in the case of eg \u2212 ge states, the appearance of\nlobes in this diagram (sudden large tESD ) is due to the\nemergence of a new entanglement revival. For example,\nat \u03c9c = 13\u0393 and \u03a9 = 25\u0393 as in Fig. 6(b), we have two\nrevivals and, with these parameters, we are at the second\nlobe in Fig. 7.\n\nX \u03b3j\n\u0001\n(n\u0304j + 1) 2\u03c3j\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3j+ \u2212 \u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03c3j+ \u03c3j\u2212\n2\nj=1,2\n\u0001\n\u03b3j\n(27)\n+ n\u0304j 2\u03c3j+ \u03c1\u03c3j\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3j\u2212 \u03c3j+ \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03c3j\u2212 \u03c3j+ ,\n2\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nConcurrence\n\n\u0012\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0\n1\n\n0.1\n1\n0.5\n\ns\n\n0.05\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u0393t\n0.7\n\n(b)\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nConcurrence\n\n+ sinh\n\n7\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n1\n1\n0.5\n\ns\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u0393t\n\nFig. 6.

Also, for \u03a9 = 0 and at zero temperature, the problem can be solved analytically [15]. Here\nwe will show that finite temperature can have nontrivial\neffects, as demonstrated by the case of eg \u2212 ge states.\nFor Werner states, as expected, there is no dependence\non \u03c9c , either at zero temperature or at finite temperature. Also here, the only effect of temperature is that it\ndecreases the sudden death time and tends to transform\nalso the regions which were decaying exponentially (e.g.\nfor Werner states, for 0.714 < f < 1 [4]) into sudden\ndeath.\n\n\f8\n\nJ.

What happens is that the single quanta of energy start to oscillate between the two\nqubits. The dipole-dipole form of the interaction assures\nthat the dynamics occurs only in the subspace spanned\nby |01i and |10i, and, during its evolution, the state of\nthe system goes through\n\u221a Bell entangled states of the type\n|\u03a8 \u00b1 i = (|01i \u00b1 |10i)/ 2. Now, if there is no dissipation,\nthe concurrence will simply oscillate. If the temperature is\nzero, the concurrence decays exponentially. Once temperature is introduced, the system will display sudden death of\nentanglement and will acquire a finite tESD . Moreover, delayed sudden birth of entanglement is produced due to the\nfact that during oscillations the concurrence could go below zero but then revive after some time, winning against\nthe thermal noise.\n\n15\n\nFig. 7. (color online) (a) Time of sudden death of entanglement for ee \u2212 gg states as a function of parameter s of the\ninitial state and the coupling \u03c9c for \u03a9 = 25\u0393 , obtained numerically. (b) The corresponding analytical result of (a) in the\nsecular approximation.\n\nFor YE states, we find numerically that there is no\nchange of concurrence as a function of \u03c9c , either at zero\ntemperature or at finite temperature. The only effect of\nfinite temperature is that it makes the YE states that\nwould otherwise decay exponentially at zero temperature\n(the states with 1/4 < \u03b1 < 1/3) become sudden-death\nstates as well.\nFor ee \u2212 gg states tESD is zero, as the initial state has\nno entanglement: the coupling does not create entanglement by itself. Pumping is needed here. There is no interesting effect at finite temperature: tESD remains zero.\nFor eg\u2212ge states at zero temperature there is no structure in the tESD diagram, again due to the fact that the\nstates decay exponentially. Also at very large temperatures (n \u226b 1) there is no structure: this time because the\ndecay is too fast and tESD becomes essentially zero. However, for intermediate temperatures a structure somewhat\nsimilar with that obtained in the case of driving emerges,\nshown in Fig. 8 (b) for n\u03041 = n\u03042 = 0.25.\nThis is somehow unexpected: usually the situation is\nthat features appearing at a certain temperature would be\nenhanced at even lower temperatures (or in other words\nthe only effect of temperature is usually to wash out the\nfeatures seen at zero or very low temperatures). We note\nhere the similarity between Fig. 8 (b) and the case of zerotemperature driving Fig. 5 (although differences in the\n\n7 Conclusion\nWe have investigated the phenomenon of sudden death of\nentanglement for certain subclasses of so-called X states\nunder continuous driving and coupling. We show that each\nof these states present notable peculiarities when analyzing the time evolution: for Werner states, the evolution is\nindependent of coupling, for YE states the time of sudden death presents soft oscillations as a result of coupling,\nand for diagonal (eg \u2212 ge and ee \u2212 gg) states tESD shows\nabrupt oscillations, due to the sudden appearance of delayed birth of entanglement for certain value of the coupling. We present both analytical formulae and numerical\nevidence for these phenomena.\n\n8 Acknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Academy of Finland (Acad.\nRes.
