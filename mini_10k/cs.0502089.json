Introduction\nCosmic rays have been the subject of scientific research\nsince 1912 when Victor Hess confirmed their existence\nfrom a balloon several kilometers above Earth. Our upper\natmosphere is awash with these particles that are created\nin many astronomical objects. Most have low energies but\nstill penetrate to Earth's surface. More fascinating are\ncosmic rays with energies six times higher than current\ntheory allows. Two such events have prompted scientists\nto study more of these high-energy particles and to try to\ndiscover their source. [1] High school students have an\nopportunity to contribute to this research.\nWe are deploying a network of classroom cosmic ray\ndetectors in high schools across North America. [2] The\n\nPaul Nepywoda\nFermilab\nnepywoda@fnal.gov\n\ndetectors capture the time and location of the arrival of\ncosmic rays and save the data to a local computer (Figure\n1). They use GPS timing to ensure precise timestamps. [3]\nThese detectors are sensitive enough to capture cosmic\nrays that fill in the energy spectrum from low to high and\npossibly even to see one of the rare high-energy events.\n\nFigure 1. The school-based detector\nIn addition to conducting individual studies for muon\nflux or lifetime, students are able to set up detectors to\nfunction as an array that covers an area including several\nschools. When the local data are uploaded to a central\nserver, students in the collaboration can investigate data\nfrom one school or combine data from multiple sites. Students without detectors can also be active members of the\ncollaboration by accessing and analyzing data.\nThe science lends itself to project-based learning, a system for organizing portions of the curriculum around illstructured problems that help students acquire knowledge\nwhile building problem-solving skills. The science calls\nfor collaboration, requiring students to function in an experimental environment similar to high-energy physics\ncollaborations, in which the web plays a vital part in supporting research. They must participate in a network of\n\n\fusers that needs access to computer cycles, storage capacity, shared data and data products, community-defined\nanalysis tools, and communication tools to share and discuss results. The QuarkNet/Grid Collaborative Learning\ne-Lab provides this online, cross-platform and ubiquitous\nenvironment.\n\n2. Case study\nFor this case study we make an assumption that some\nresearch experiments using grids will have data interesting to and appropriate for secondary school classroom\ninvestigations, and that partnerships of computer scientists, research scientists and educators can create online\ncollaborative learning environments, e-Labs, for students.\nThe foundation of an e-Lab is the grid infrastructure and\nvirtual data tools and techniques; experiments provide\ndata, analysis software and background material; on top of\nthese resources educators create user-friendly, singlepurpose, application-specific web pages.\nOur case study is a partnership between QuarkNet [4]\nand the GriPhyN [5] Project. QuarkNet is an education\nprogram for US ATLAS and USCMS, United States collaborations working on experiments for the Large Hadron\nCollider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Participants also work on as many as nine other\nhigh-energy experiments, for example, BaBar, CDF, D\u00d8,\nFAST and MINOS. A long-term program, QuarkNet\nbrings high school teachers and their students into research groups nationwide. Students learn fundamental\nphysics as they analyze live online data and participate in\ninquiry-oriented investigations.\nThe GriPhyN Project is developing grid technologies for\nscientific and engineering projects that must collect and\nanalyze distributed, petabyte-scale datasets. GriPhyN research will enable the development of Petascale Virtual\nData Grids (PVDGs) through its Virtual Data Toolkit. [6]\nThe QuarkNet/Grid research project explores the potential of using virtual data grid tools and techniques to support student data-analysis projects for US ATLAS and\nUSCMS. We begin with a pilot cosmic ray study that provides a chance for:\n\u2022 Students to do authentic research-to access, process\nand publish data, report and share their results as online posters, and have online discussions with one\nanother about their work.\n\u2022 Student researchers to experience the environment of\nscientific collaborations.\n\u2022 Student researchers to make contributions to a burgeoning scientific field.\n\u2022 Educational researchers to evaluate the effectiveness\nof such an endeavor.\n\n3. Collaborative learning environment\nIn our vision for collaborative learning, student research\nteams conduct investigations of real-world problems or\nissues through online projects that are collaborative, student-driven and technology-dependent. When skillfully\napplied, technology can enhance learning in new and\npowerful ways such as allowing students to reach beyond\nclassroom walls to collaborate and publish original work\nto a worldwide audience. When skillfully designed, projects can require collaboration among student groups and\nbetween students and experts. With appropriate management tools, students can design and carry out an investigation even though they are novice researchers, and\nteachers can facilitate student learning, track their progress and assess their work.\nWe share a vision for technology-enhanced learning with\nsuch projects as EleGI and GRIDCOLE. Because we want\nour students to be \"apprentice scientists\" who use the grid\nas their professional partners do, we start with the\nemerging grid infrastructure being developed by GriPhyN\nand iVDgL [7]. We build our learning environment on top\nof an existing grid architecture used by scientists. We do\nnot attempt to build new grid-based services for the\nlearning environment such as the Learning Flow grid\nservices in the EleGI project.\nFrom a learning perspective, we base our work on twelve\nyears of experience with the LInC Program, which has\ndeveloped demonstrators that integrate best uses of nongrid technology with inquiry-based teaching and learning.\nThe research base comes from the U.S. Department of\nEducation's North Central Regional Educational Laboratory [8].\n\n3.1. Cosmic Ray Collaboration\nIn the Cosmic Ray Collaboration students experience the\nenvironment of scientific collaborations in a series of investigations into high-energy cosmic rays. The collaboration is a student-led, teacher-guided project. Schools with\ncosmic ray detectors can upload data to the server. A virtual data portal (Figure 2) enables students to share these\ndata and associated analysis code with students at other\nschools whether those schools have their own cosmic ray\ndetectors or not.\nStudents can pose a number of questions and then design\nan investigation and analyze the data for answers. Some\nanswers are new to students but well-answered by physicists. These include the muon lifetime, rate of cosmic ray\narrival and the source of low-energy air showers. However, the origin of the highest-energy cosmic rays is an\nopen question-several experiments are actually exploring it now. [9, 10] Students may be able to contribute data\nto these efforts.\n\n\ftion for all groups in the collaboration. The main navigation bar is consistent throughout the student pages. Most\nlinks on the navigation bar also have a submenu for major\nresources in that section. A pop-up glossary helps students\nincrease their vocabulary. Other tools help with various\ndata analysis and management functions and with poster\npreparation.\n\nFigure 2. Student interface for searching and\nselecting uploaded data files for later analysis\nStudents interpret their data (Figure 3) and post results in\nonline posters or papers. Associated with the posters are\ncomment areas. Students can explore data provenance,\ncomment on the work of others and respond to peer feedback. Because of this feedback they may modify their\ninvestigation, test the investigations of others, or design\nnew investigations. In other words, they are doing science\nfrom a website that uses grid tools and techniques just like\ntheir professional colleagues on US ATLAS and USCMS.\n\n3.2 Website support - student pages\nThe collaborative learning environment is supported by a\nwebsite divided into two major sections: stand-alone student pages and teacher pages. Because students are novice\nresearchers, the website must provide scaffolding to help\nthem navigate a scientific investigation. For example, the\nfirst time a student team uses the website after the introductory animation, they are directed through two pages\nthat welcome them to the collaboration, show an example\nof the end product and provide tips for using the website\nbefore going to the study guide, the primary research\nmanagement tool. The guide presents a list of milestones\nthat, if followed, will result in a complete investigation.\nThe study guide corresponds to what the learning community calls workflow. In this paper we use workflow in\nthe computer science sense, referring to the flow of data\nthrough a set of calculations.\nAssociated with each milestone is a resource with references and access to a team e-Logbook. A reference page\nprovides links to tutorials for each of the studies, animations, other URLs, access to experts and contact informa-\n\nFigure 3. The result of running the lifetime study.\nExponential signature provides evidence of\nmuons decaying in scintillator plastic.\nThe QuarkNet/Grid project is designed for student research teams which is, in itself, a collaborative process.\nThe website promotes asynchronous collaboration among\nstudent research groups and between students and experts.\nFeatures include a common searchable database, data\nvalidation, accessible data files, reproducible computer\nworkflow, comment sections on data files, graphs and\nposters, and access to experts.\n\n3.3 Website support - teacher pages\nCollaborative project-based learning requires a skilled\nteacher/facilitator who understands the importance of each\nstep of the project and allows time for students to move at\ntheir own pace through the investigation. With a website\nfor instructional delivery, a teacher needs online tools to\nmanage her classroom. Teacher pages [11] function\nsomewhat like the teacher's edition of a textbook with a\ngeneral introduction to the project. This includes a list of\nprior knowledge and skills, learner outcomes, information\naligning the student work to U.S. National Science Education Standards, teaching strategies, a site index and\n\n\fmore. Currently, the site is designed for QuarkNet teachers who have already participated in staff development\nprograms and need limited assistance with cosmic ray\ncontent and student research techniques.\nThe e-Logbook is a primary tool to track, assess and\nguide student work because the logbook is linked to the\nstudy guide. For example, a teacher can look at and grade\nall of her research team descriptions of cosmic rays. Or\nshe can look at the notes of a particular team to track progress or see if the students have missed resources that\nwould help them over a trouble spot. A teacher can write\ncomments to the logbooks. In addition, teachers have the\noption of using online pre- and post-tests of science content and data-handling skills, and a printable rubric to\nassess achievement of learner outcomes.\n\nRequests for data products and recipes can be mapped\ntransparently into computation and/or data access to grid\nresources worldwide.\n\n4.3 Chiron portal\nBuilt on top of this virtual data system is the Chiron\nportal [12] developed at the University of Chicago by\nMike Wilde, Yong Zhao, et al. It provides a web interface\nto the Java API and services provided by GriPhyN virtual\ndata toolkit. Using a web browser, users can define and\nexecute workflows, publish their data products, share\nthem with other users, and discover and build on the work\nof other users (Figure 4). Workflows are executed on the\nlocal server or in the grid environment.\n\n4. Implementation\nThe QuarkNet/Grid Collaborative Learning e-Lab is\nbased on the GriPhyN Virtual Data System and the Chiron portal. This section describes the system architecture,\nthe features of the virtual data system and the Chiron\nportal that are central to our e-Lab and then their specific\nuses in the QuarkNet/Grid e-Lab.\n\n4.1 System architecture\nThe web-based e-Lab consists of an Apache Tomcat web\nserver with JavaServer Pages (JSP), the GriPhyN Virtual\nData System API and libraries (jar files), backend databases for the virtual data system, customized application\nsoftware, GraphViz for graph visualization and workflow\nengines for local execution. We expect to add grid execution including Condor-G for grid job submission and execution. The e-Lab requires the Chiron portal as one website and an additional web portal for the e-Lab. Students\naccess the site with browsers that support SSL for security, DHTML and Javascript for interactivity and cookies\nfor session tracking. This provides a platform-independent\nenvironment to serve students worldwide.\n\n4.2 The Virtual Data System\nThe GriPhyN Virtual Data System is central to the implementation of the QuarkNet/Grid Collaborative Learning e-Lab. It addresses the need for scientists worldwide\nwith data-intensive applications to share data, data products, and resources needed to create their data products.\nThis system supports the definition of recipes to derive\ndata products with the Virtual Data Language (VDL) and\nthe storage of metadata describing data, data products and\nrecipes in a Virtual Data Catalog (VDC). The metadata\nand query functionality facilitate the discovery and reuse\nof resources so scientists can build on each other's work.\n\nFigure 4. Chiron/QuarkNet architecture. Light\ngray items exist in Chiron and are in the QuarkNet development pipeline.\nThe Chiron portal itself is general purpose and not tied to\nany particular scientific application. It provides an environment for a community of users to define the recipes\nneeded for specific scientific applications. The recipes\ninclude the definitions of specific data analysis procedures\nboth as transformations (TRs), the counterpart of a function definition, and derivations (DVs), the counterpart of\nfunction calls with specific arguments to be used in the\nexecution of the TR. These recipes are represented by text\nor XML and stored in a database.\n4.3.1 Metadata. The Chiron portal supports entering\nmetadata, information about the data and definitions, into\n\n\fthe VDC both manually and automatically. Metadata is\navailable for datasets, transformations, transformation\nparameters, derivations, and compound TRs (TRs that\nreference other TRs). Users can load and search metadata\nthat consists of multiple name, type and value tuples (attribute_name, type, attribute_values) associated with a\nmetadata object (e.g., a logical file name). The values can\nbe integer, float, string, date or boolean. A metadata query\nlanguage allows users to search for TRs, DVs and logical\nfiles with specific attributes. These queries are translated\ninto SQL or XQuery, submitted to the backend database\nsystem and returned to the user in an accessible format.\n4.3.2 Provenance. Provenance provides the audit trail for\nthe derivation of a data product, for example, the transformations and time of their execution, the specific\ndatasets and input parameters (Figure 5). Every time a\nderivation is executed, a workflow is recorded. Provenance supports the ability of users to re-execute derivations or to modify derivations and provide related data\nproducts.\n\ngrid planner which harnesses grid resources worldwide.\nThe local planner converts the workflow definition into a\nset of shell scripts to invoke the programs on the local\nmachine. Users use the Chiron portal to upload these applications.\n\n4.4 The QuarkNet/Grid portal\nDevelopers of the QuarkNet portal have provided an application-specific web portal that complements and builds\non the Chiron portal (Figure 6). It integrates virtual data\nmechanisms by calling APIs that encapsulate specific\nChiron portal functions. It is user-friendly and provides\ninterfaces (\"skins\") that reflect the needs of the QuarkNet/Grid e-Lab. It hides the details of workflows, transformations and derivations from the high school students\nand teachers. Developers use the Chiron portal to define\ntransformations and compound transformations in VDL\nand upload applications (analysis code written in Perl for\ncosmic ray data). They define specific derivations in the\nChiron portal to test that the transformations work in this\nenvironment. The Chiron portal displays the transformations and derivations, the data products, DAGs (graphs of\nthe workflow), and all metadata associated with these,\nincluding the annotation of the parameters used in the\ntransformations.\n\nFigure 6. QuarkNet portal architecture, including\ndata and control paths\n\nFigure 5. Workflow for lifetime study\n4.3.3 Job submission. Jobs can be submitted to either the\nlocal planner to run on the local machine or sent to the\n\n4.4.1 JavaServer Pages. JavaServer Pages provide dynamic pages for the students to: upload their data, search\nfor datasets, use forms to enter analysis parameters, analyze their data and publish their work as posters. Each\nanalysis displays a resultant plot generated by Perl code\nand gnuplot, a graphics package. Students have the option\nof saving these plots and their accompanying metadata,\nDAGs and workflows. The JavaServer Pages include calls\nto middleware to create derivations \"on the fly\" that are\n\n\ftransformed into shell scripts and executed on the local\nmachine to generate the data products. Students use the\ndata products in the online posters they publish.\n4.4.2 Use of metadata. Metadata is critical to the implementation of the portal. Students can search for, view, and\nannotate datasets, resultant plots, and posters.\n\nFigure 7. A poster describing the work done in a\nlifetime study. The figures cited in the poster are\nthe same as Figures 4 and 6 in this paper.\nAll searches involve underlying metadata queries, and\nstudents can look at the metadata associated with each.\nThe grid middleware includes APIs to allow setting metadata from JavaServer Pages. Students can annotate data,\nplots and posters of other students by adding comments to\neach. Comments are stored as metadata for the data, plot\nor poster. Comments as metadata provide a way for students to communicate and collaborate.\nStudents can look at figures associated with posters and\nfind the DAGs associated with data plots. They will soon\nbe able to recreate any plot made by other student re-\n\nsearch groups and then manipulate input parameters to\nmake related plots. This functionality for discovery allows\nthem to build on each others' work as scientists do.\nTable 1.

Metadata provides an excellent way to integrate this content into the site. To understand the analysis inputs students see on their web\npages, students access the annotations of input parameters\nentered by the developer using the Chiron portal. The\nmetadata implementation is hidden from the students; to\nthem it is just another link to a pop-up web page. Developers have defined two classes of documentation, glossary items and references. References are short web pages\nthat provide background information for students in their\ninvestigation. They can include links to other web pages\nwithin or outside the portal. All glossary items and references are associated with logical file names in the VDS\nstarting with Glossary_ and Reference_, respectively.\nBoth have metadata annotations including the name, type\n(glossary or reference) and the description of the item.\nMetadata can include HTML, so the definitions of glossary items are stored as text metadata that can be displayed to students in web pages. Web pages available\nonly to content providers for the Cosmic Ray Collaboration allow defining glossary items and references. Summary pages of all the glossary items and references are\navailable for the students.\n4.4.3 User database. We have developed a user database\nin PostgreSQL to store information about the research\ngroups, their teachers, their locations, their roles, questions for pretests, student responses to the pre- and posttests and the content of the e-Logbook for each research\ngroup and teacher. Web pages provide registration of stu-\n\n\fdent research groups and the administration of the preand post-tests used for program evaluation and student\nassessment.\n\nOur outside evaluator provides input based on her experience using the portal with students. This \"product testing\"\ncontinues to be an important development step.\n\n4.5 Lessons learned from the QuarkNet grid implementation\n\n5. Next steps\n\nThe implementation of the QuarkNet/Grid portal has\nprovided valuable insight into what other e-Labs will require, which components are e-Lab-independent, and\nwhich are e-Lab-specific. Independent components include basic website structure, registration, login, data interface, some transformation, e.g., the histogram transformation, application of transformations to data, documentation of variables used by science code, implementation of glossary and references, authoring posters, comments on posters and data\nIt has also provided information on what additional\nfunctionality is needed in the Chiron portal to make it\nmore useful to students and scientists. For example, currently the Chiron portal, as opposed to the QuarkNet/Grid\nportal, does not display or allow searches of datasets. The\ninterface to define transformations is difficult to use and\ncould be improved with a graphical interface. It is not as\nuser-friendly as average high-schoolers require for their\nwork. However, the Chiron portal and its accompanying\nAPIs empower the developers. It provides an authoring\nsystem and interface to the Virtual Data System required\nto build the QuarkNet/Grid e-Lab website.\nProfessional development is an important component of\nour program. Our experience is currently limited to teachers that understand the content embedded in the QuarkNet\nportal. We have three modes of instruction for these\nteachers. We focus on the web portal in all three modes.\nIn large workshops (one-week, 25 participants), we model\nthe practices and habits of scientists. Teachers join their\npeers in research groups, meet the problem at hand and\nwork out the solution using the portal. In addition to modeling behaviors of scientists, the teachers use the portal as\ntheir students do. In smaller, one-day workshops we provide more guidance to the teacher's exploration of the\nportal. These shorter sessions leave less room for exploration, and we highlight important features of the portal.\nWe also visit teachers and students for one-to-few coaching in the use of the portal. We learn as much about the\ninterface as users do about the science in these sessions.\nIt is too early to determine if the QuarkNet/Grid setting\nenhances learning or the role that technology plays in enhancing learning. However, we gain valuable information\nfrom formative evaluation as we iterate the portal.\nTeacher focus groups use the portal as if they were students to identify showstoppers or sticking points. They\nidentify areas for additional classroom management tools\nand point out information needed on the teacher pages.\n\nThe QuarkNet portal provides a solid foundation upon\nwhich students participate in real science collaboration.\nWe have thus far focused primarily on delivering a highly\nusable and appealing science collaboration for a specific\naudience of students. Looking ahead, we envision and\nhave begun developing numerous enhancements that will\ndeliver richer science collaborations to students.\n\n5.1 Student access to transformations\nAdvanced students (primarily in computer science\nclasses) will have access to the Chiron portal if they\nwould like to understand the underlying functionality, to\ncombine the available transforms in new ways and to\nwrite their own transforms. For example, students with\nappropriate permissions could write and upload new Perl\ncode through the Chiron portal. By combining the new\ncode with existing atomic transformations, the students\nmake new analysis tools. These new analysis tools could\nthen become public to the collaboration.\n\n5.2 Data simulations\nWeb experiments exist that enable students to interactively investigate the concept of background in data. For\nexample, Ultra Electronics interactive demos [13] give\nstudents the ability to hear the noise of a jet before and\nafter noise reduction. Students must make careful determinations of similar background in cosmic ray data. They\ncan use data from another detector to see how often their\nsignal is mimicked. They must then subtract this background from their measurements. We will develop tools to\nfacilitate this measurement and subtraction.\n\n5.3 Additional e-Lab topics\nCurrently, we are refactoring our original code design as\na first step to creating a developer toolkit for other science\nexperiments, like CMS. We will convert our JSP-only\ndesign into an Object-Oriented JAR file hierarchy. In this\nway we can provide documentation and an organized approach to creating e-Labs. The VDS code is open source,\nand the e-Lab toolkit will be open source.\n\n\f5.4 Farming out calculations and data to the grid\nWe have reached a critical point in the QuarkNet/Grid\nproject where a single computer is no longer enough to\nanalyze the datasets students have accumulated. Currently, a student makes a request to analyze a set of files\nand waits synchronously for the result to return. In the\nbeginning of our project, this paradigm made sense.\nHowever, if a student chooses to look for a shower at\nthree schools over a period of three days, she can expect\nto wait about an hour for the computation to complete; or\nlonger for very large datasets. We plan to build an asynchronous user interface for web-based grid job submission. As a result of this requirement, QuarkNet is pushing\nVDS feature development. We contribute our solutions\nback into the main VDS development line.\n\n5.5 Support for teachers without detectors or outside QuarkNet\nWhile the current project focuses on students in classrooms with QuarkNet teachers, we envision a much larger\ncollaboration including students whose teachers participate in other collaborations such as the Cosmic Ray Observatory Project (CROP) [14] and Washington Large\nArea Time Coincidence Array (WALTA) [15], and teachers not affiliated with such projects. Even within QuarkNet, some teachers will not have access to a classroom\ndetector. This will require us to develop more background\nmaterial for students and materials as well as professional\ndevelopment activities for teachers. As a first attempt towards including a greater number of teachers, we will\ninclude QuarkNet teachers without detectors. Students\nfrom these classrooms will participate by examining,\nanalyzing and commenting on other students' data. As a\nlong-term goal, we strive to include an increasing number\nof online resources that enable teachers to pursue the\nproject without training from the national QuarkNet staff.\nThis will increase the size of the collaboration. For example, we have doubled the number of resources we offer\nsince December 2004.\n\n5.6 Evaluation\nAn outside evaluator is designing an assessment to determine the effectiveness of using grid techniques and\ntools to support learning. The evaluation is divided into\ntwo phases. Currently, we are completing Phase\nI-testing and improving the student web interface and\ngrid tools. Activities involve iterative testing using a protocol to watch teachers and students use the site and improving the site. They also include an assessment of prior\nknowledge and skills needed to use the site. After the site\nis stable, we move to Phase II-an assessment of learning\n\nphysics content and using scientific data. Activities include building online pre- and post-tests, student observations, \"think aloud\" interviews, review of student posters\nand e-Logbooks, and a discourse analysis on student use\nof communication and collaboration tools.\n\n6.
