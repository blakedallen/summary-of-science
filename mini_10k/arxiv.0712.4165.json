Several comments on its content are made, which constitute, at the same time, a\nbrief state-of-the-art review of nonextensive statistical mechanics, a current generalization of the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs theory. Some inadvertences and misleading sentences are pointed out as well.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nTo appear in Astrophysics and Space Science (Springer, 2008), in press.\nElectronic address: tsallis@cbpf.br\n\n1\n\n\fT. Dauxois has recently commented [1] an interesting paper by Hilhorst and Schehr [2].\nIn the latter paper, two specific probabilistic models, namely a discrete one [3] (from now\non referred to as the MTG model) and a continuous one [4] (from now on referred to as\nthe TMNT model), are analytically discussed. Both models consist in N correlated random\nvariables (respectively discrete and continuous), and the point under study is what is the\nlimiting distribution when N \u2192 \u221e. Numerical indications1 have been found that quite\nstrongly suggest that these limiting distributions could be of the q-Gaussian class (Eq. (1)\nin [1]). Hilhorst and Schehr have shown [2] that they are not, even if they are numerically\nintriguingly close. The relations between the entropic indices q (of the possible q-Gaussian\nlimiting distributions) and the parameters of the models have been addressed as well. It\nwas analytically confirmed in [2] the correctness of the relations conjectured respectively in\n[3] and in [4], if these analytically exact non q-Gaussian distributions were to be approached\nby q-Gaussians!\nWhy may all this have some general interest? The reason lies on the fact that q-Gaussian\ndistributions play a special role in nonextensive statistical mechanics [5, 6, 7], a current\ngeneralization (based on the entropy (2) of [1]) of the celebrated BG theory. Recent reviews\nof q-statistics and a vast set of experimental, observational and computational applications\nand/or verifications can be seen in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Very specifically, it has been recently\nproved [13] a q-generalization of the Central Limit Theorem for q \u2265 1. More precisely,\nif we have N random variables that are strongly correlated in a special manner (called\nq-independence; see [13] for details), it can be rigorously proved that their sum approaches,\nwhen appropriately centered and scaled, a q-Gaussian distribution. The standard CLT\nis recovered as the q = 1 particular instance. The proof is under progress for q < 1\n(which are distributions with a compact support, even in the N \u2192 \u221e limit). Nevertheless,\npreliminary studies suggest that the q-CLT should remain applicable even for q < 1. Since\nthe MTG and TMNT models have a compact support (i.e., of the q < 1 type), one expects\nq-Gaussians whenever the correlation is of the q-independent type. Given the results in\n[1] See the title of the present Ref. [3].\n\n2\n\n\f[2], one is naturally led to argue that the strong correlations in those two models are not\nq-independent but only almost q-independent. An interesting question remains then open.\nWhat physical ingredient have the MTG and TMNT models failed to incorporate? In other\nwords, there is something which is still missing in those models in order for the correlation\nto be exactly q- independent. What is it? Progress is presently being achieved along this\nline (deeply related to asymptotic scale-invariance), but this remains outside the present\nscope, which primarily is the careful scrutiny of the paper [1]. Let us address now some of\nthe weaknesses of that paper.\n\n(i) In contrast with what one reads in [1], the T MNT model is not at all described\nnor presented in its Ref. [3]. In fact, it is not even mentioned there, and has never been\npublished!\n\n2\n\n. Dauxois visibly confuses with [14], whose content has absolutely nothing to\n\ndo with the model discussed by Hilhorst and Schehr. Had the Author of [1] paid more\nattention to his own Ref. [3], or at least to its title, the confusion would have been avoided.\n\n(ii) The statement \"could be the basis for a generalized central limit theorem\" (below Eq.\n(1) of [1]) reveals that the Author is possibly unaware of the proof existing since already\nsome time in [13] (further extensions are possible along the lines of [15, 16]).\n\n(iii) The statement \"The basis for this suggestion ...\" (above Eq. (2) of [1]) reveals\nthat the Author is unaware that the crucial point is not the isolated fact that q-Gaussians\noptimize Sq (something which, in contrast with what is referred in [1], is not even vaguely\nmentioned in Ref. [2] of [1]!), but rather the remarkable fact that q-Gaussians also happen\nto be [17, 18] exact stable solutions of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (since many\ndecades called Porous Medium Equation). The mere fact that q-Gaussians would optimize\n[2] The details of the T M N T model, as well as all our numerical and graphical results, were transmitted\nprivately by me to Hilhorst, who had heard, in Natal-Brazil in March 2007, an oral presentation of mine\nincluding that subject\n\n3\n\n\fsome specific entropic functional would certainly not be of any particular significance. The\nentire rationale of what was at the time a conjecture (and is now a proved theorem) can be\nseen in [19].\n\n(iv) The qualification \"in the absence of firm grounds...\" reveals that the Author\nof [1] is possibly unaware of the numerous rigorous results which precisely provide a\nfirm mathematical basis for the entropy Sq and the associated nonextensive statistical\nmechanics. Among many others, let us mention the q-generalization, respectively in [20]\nand in [21], of Shannon's and of Khinchine's uniqueness theorems, the already mentioned\nq-central limit theorems in [13], the Lesche-stability [22] and the Topsoe-factorizability\n[23] of the entropy Sq , the analytical results in [24] for Langevin-like stochastic equations\nin the presence of multiplicative noise, the analytical results of [25, 26, 27, 28] concerning\nunimodal dissipative one-dimensional maps, the analytical connection [29, 30, 31] to the\nBeck-Cohen superstatistics, etc.\n\n(v) The Author of [1] wonders whether the whole idea of q-statistics could be \"just a\nnice idea and a powerful fitting function\". Fitting functions typically have one or more\nfitting parameters. Let us focus on this point. Fitting parameters can be of quite different\nnatures. The first, and in some sense more fundamental, class is constituted by those\nnumbers for which no theory exists in contemporary physics that could produce them\nfrom more basic principles. In this class we have all the so-called universal constants of\ncontemporary physics (c, h, G, and kB ), which, as well known, might not even be constants!\nThey are obtained, nowadays with great precision, from fittings concerning basic physical\nlaws such as the Planck law for the black-body radiation. A second class is constituted by\nthose parameters that can ideally be deduced from first principles through some specific\nway involving some specific information. But, in many cases, the procedure turns out to be\nuntractable, either because of mathematical difficulties, or because some of the necessary\ninformation is missing. Such is the case of the orbit of say Mars. Newtonian mechanics\n\n4\n\n\fcan in principle predict this orbit given, at some time, the positions and velocities of all\nmasses of the planetary system. Since this information is unavailable (and even if it was\navailable, a colossal computer would be needed to perform the calculations!), astronomers\nuse, as a first approximation, the elliptic form of a Keplerian orbit and just fit this form\n(which can be easily obtained within Newtonian mechanics) in order to obtain the concrete\nvalues of the two axis of the ellipse. The entropic index q belongs to this class. It can be\nin principle deduced from the microscopic dynamics of the system. And this is indeed done\nsuccessfully in some few simple cases. But in most cases, this precise dynamics is unknown,\nor the calculations are untractable. Therefore q can be obtained by fitting results with the\nanalytic forms (q-exponentials, q-Gaussians) that emerge within nonextensive statistical\nmechanics. A third class of fitting parameters would be those which emerge from no specific\ntheory, but are present in some convenient heuristic expressions. Within the q-statistical\ntheory, we are not especially interested in those.\n\n(vi) Dauxois considers \"particularly pressing\" an undoubtedly relevant question, namely\n\"does the q-Gaussian law describe the details of some physical problems?\". Many systems\nexist that have been shown to exhibit, at the available precision, q-Gaussians. A particularly\ninstructive example concerns cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices. It was predicted in\n2003 by Lutz [32] that these atoms should have a q-Gaussian distribution of velocities with\nq =1+\n\n44ER\n,\nU0\n\n(1)\n\nER and U0 being respectively the microscopic recoil energy and potential depth. In 2006, an\nimpressive confirmation was provided [33], through both quantum Monte Carlo simulations,\nand real experiments with Cs atoms (the quality of the agreements are given by the\ncorrelation coefficients R2 = 0.995 and R2 = 0.9985 respectively). Other examples (some of\nthem briefly mentioned in [1]) that, within reasonably good approximation, have exhibited\nq-Gaussians are the motion of cells of Hydra viridissima [34], defect turbulence [35],\nfluctuations of the magnetic field in the solar wind [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], fluctuations of the\ntemperature of the universe [42], financial return distributions [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49],\n5\n\n\fmany-body Hamiltonian with long-range-interacting classical rotators approached through\nthe HMF [50, 51], logistic map at edge of chaos [52], granular matter [53], earthquakes [54],\netc.\n\n(vii) \"More importantly\", as a second, \"particularly pressing\" question, Dauxois asks \"is\nanyone able to provide analytical predictions of the value of the q-index in terms of the\nmicroscopic parameters of the physical system?\". This is of course an important point, that\nany quantitatively mature statistical mechanical theory (and physical theory in general) is\nexpected to satisfy. The Author might be unaware of the fact that many examples exist\nfor which analytical calculations of q have been possible from microscopic or mesoscopic\ndynamics. Let us mention some of them. Of course, Eq. (1) already constitutes one such\nexample. Another analytical result is the fact that the index q has been connected [55]\nwith the standard critical exponent \u03b4 (the exponent characterizing the order parameter as a\nfunction of its thermodynamically conjugate variable, at a second-order critical phenomenon)\nas follows:\nq=\n\n1+\u03b4\n.\n2\n\n(2)\n\nIn the area of quantum entanglement, the block entropy of fully entangled quantum magnetic\nchains involving only short-range interactions, has been recently proved to satisfy [56]\n\u221a\n9 + c2 \u2212 3\nq=\n,\n(3)\nc\nwhere c is the central charge emerging within conformal quantum field theory. This means\n\u221a\nthat, for the Ising ferromagnet (i.e., c = 1/2) we have q = 37 \u2212 6 = 0.08..., and for the\n\u221a\nisotropic XY ferromagnet (i.e., c = 1), we have q = 10 \u2212 3 = 0.16.... In the limit c \u2192 \u221e\nthe BG result q = 1 is recovered. As another analytical connection, we may mention the\nAlbert-Barabasi model in [57] for (asymptotically) scale-free networks, for which we have\n(see [58] for the connection of the Albert-Barabasi exponent and q)\nq=\n\n2m(2 \u2212 r) + 1 \u2212 p \u2212 r\n,\nm(3 \u2212 2r) + 1 \u2212 p \u2212 r\n6\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere (m, p, r) are microscopic parameters of the model. Let us also mention that, on the\ngrounds of [18], the following connection is since long predicted between q and the anomalous\ndiffusion space-time scaling exponent \u03b3:\n\u03b3=\n\n2\n.\n3\u2212q\n\n(5)\n\nThis prediction has been verified by now in various systems, such as the Hydra viridissima\ncells [34], defect turbulence [35], \u03b1-XY inertial ferromagnetic model [59] (see [60] for details\non the model), and granular matter flowing out from a silo [53].\nAs our last present illustration of analytical predictions involving q, we may mention one\nwhich is available since 1999 [61, 62, 63] and which has been successfully applied to plasma\nastrophysics (e.g., solar plasma). For weakly nonideal plasma, we have [61, 62, 63]\n| q \u2212 1| = 24 \u03b14 \u03b3 2 < 1 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 (typically 0.4 < \u03b1 < 0.9) is the ion-ion correlation-function parameter (see details\nin [64, 65]), and \u03b3 \u2261 (Ze)2 n1/3 /kB T is the plasma parameter (see Eq. (7) of [61]), n being\nthe average density.\n\n(viii) The Author of [1] makes, a few lines later, a short-cut which might mislead the\nquick reader. He states that \"Hilhorst and Schehr show that q-Gaussians do not pass\na careful inspection.\". Instead, what these Authors have (interestingly) shown is that\nthe MTG and TMNT models do not pass in the very specific sense that their limiting\ndistributions are not exactly but only approximatively q-Gaussians. This point was already\ndiscussed in the beginning of the present manuscript.\n\n(ix) The Author of [1] states that \"if there is one lesson that has to be learned here,\nit is that one should be extremely careful when interpreting non-Gaussian data in terms\nof q-Gaussians\". This is certainly true. But, of course, this also is true for Gaussians,\nLorentzians, circles, ellipses, straight lines (in fact, q-Gaussians are mere straight lines\nin lnq y \u2261 (y 1\u2212q \u2212 1)/(1 \u2212 q) versus x2 representation), parabolas, etc, all the analytical\n7\n\n\ftools with which physicists have attempted to interpret and quantitatively understand the\nplethora of experimental, observational and computational results they are dealing with\nsince centuries and millenia. But of course, - ce qui est clair sans le dire est encore\nplus clair en le disant! -, any experimental, observational or computational setup can\nonly provide a finite amount of numbers with finite precision. This will always allow for\nan infinite number of analytic curves or interpretations. The content of [2] provides an\ninteresting, and possibly fruitful, illustration of this obvious fact.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFinancial support by CNPq and Faperj (Brazilian Agencies) is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n[1] T.
