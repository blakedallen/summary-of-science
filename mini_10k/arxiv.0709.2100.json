Our approach is a direct generalization of the well-known canonical perturbation\ntheory for classical systems. Similar to canonical perturbation theory, secular terms are avoided in\na systematic expansion and one obtains stable long-time behavior. These general ideas are illustrated\nby applying them to the spin-boson model and studying its non-equilibrium spin dynamics.\n\nThe theoretical investigation of non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems has recently become a very active field of research due to seminal experiments in ultracold atomic gases (for example collapse and revival\nphenomena [1]), electronic nanostructures (for example\ntransport beyond the linear response regime [2]) and generally qubit dynamics in the presence of quantum dissipation. While non-equilibrium classical systems have been\nlong studied, quantum systems in non-equilibrium hold\nthe promise of many new phenomena yet to be discovered. On the theoretical side, progress is hindered by the\nnotorious difficulty of solving non-equilibrium quantum\nmany-body problems. Motivated by the recent experiments, significant progress has been made with powerful\nnumerical methods like the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) [3] or the timedependent numerical renormalization group (TD-NRG)\n[4, 5]. However, there are few reliable analytical methods available, especially for non-perturbative problems (a\nnoteable exeception is the real time RG method [6]).\nA key problem for analytical calculations is the appearance of secular terms in time t that grow with some power\nof t. Secular terms appear naturally if one attempts\na direct perturbative expansion, e.g. in the Heisenberg\nequations of motion for the observables. Even if secular\nterms are multiplied by a small coupling constant, they\ninevitably invalidate perturbation theory for large times\neven for small coupling constants and make it impossible\nto draw conclusions about the long-time behavior. This\nproblem is also very well-known from classical mechanics, dating back to studies of planetary motion in previous centuries. In the context of analytical mechanics,\nits solution using canonical perturbation theory is wellestablished and can be found in any textbook (see, for\nexample, [7]). The basic idea is to first transform the\nHamiltonian to normal form using a canonical transformation. One can then easily solve the equations of motion for the new position and conjugate momentum variables. Only after integrating these equations of motion\n\ndoes one reexpress the old variables in terms of the new\ntime-evolved variables. It is well-established that this\nyields a much improved long-time solution without any\nsecular terms even if the canonical transformation itself\nis only done perturbatively. Surprisingly, to the best of\nour knowledge to date no attempt has been made to implement an equivalent scheme based on unitary perturbation theory for quantum many-body systems. However,\none key difference to classical systems is that in quantum\nmany-body systems one is often dealing with a continuous energy spectrum, which makes naive unitary perturbation theory impossible due to vanishing energy denominators. A way to solve this specific problem has been established recently by means of the flow equation method\n[8, 9] (for related ideas see also the similarity renormalization scheme [10]). The central idea of the flow equation method is to diagonalize a many-particle Hamiltonian through a sequence of infinitesimal unitary transformations that eliminate interaction matrix elements with\nlarge energy difference first before dealing with smaller\nenergy differences. In this way one both reorganizes a\nperturbative expansion in an RG-like manner, which allows one to recover non-perturbative energy scales, and\none avoids the above small energy denominator problem\neven for a continuous energy spectrum.\nIn this Letter we develop the general framework for\napplying the flow equation method to analytically solve\nreal time evolution problems in quantum many-body systems in exact correspondence to canonical perturbation\ntheory in classical mechanics. We will see that likewise\nsecular terms are avoided and that one can obtain reliable\nresults about the long-time dynamics even in a perturbative framework. We will then illustrate our approach by\nstudying the real time evolution of the spin-boson model\nwith an initially polarized spin and a relaxed bath. The\nspin-boson model is the paradigm of dissipative quantum\nsystems and its non-equilibrium behavior has recently\nbeen investigated using the TD-NRG method [11, 12],\nwhich motivates our choice.\n\n\f2\nLet us briefly review the basic ideas of the flow equation approach (for more details see [9]). A manybody Hamiltonian H is diagonalized through a sequence\nof infinitesimal unitary transformations with an antihermitean generator \u03b7(B),\ndH(B)\n= [\u03b7(B), H(B)] ,\ndB\n\n(1)\n\nwith H(B = 0) the initial Hamiltonian. The \"canonical\" generator [8] is the commutator of the diagonal\npart H0 with the interaction part Hint of the Hamiltodef\nnian, \u03b7(B) = [H0 (B), Hint (B)]. Under rather general\nconditions the choice of the canonical generator leads\nto an increasingly energy-diagonal Hamiltonian H(B),\nwhere interaction matrix elements with energy transfer \u2206E decay like exp(\u2212B \u2206E 2 ). For B = \u221e the Hamiltonian will be energy-diagonal and we denote parameters\nand operators in this basis by  \u0303, e.g. H\u0303 = H(B = \u221e).\nThe key problem of the flow equation approach is\ngenerically the generation of higher and higher order interaction terms in (1), which makes it necessary to truncate the scheme in some order of a suitable systematic\nexpansion parameter (usually the running coupling constant). Still, the infinitesimal nature of the approach\nmakes it possible to deal with a continuum of energy\nscales and to describe non-perturbative effects. This had\nled to numerous applications of the flow equation method\nwhere one utilizes the fact that the Hilbert space is not\ntruncated as opposed to conventional scaling methods.\nExamples are the evaluation of correlation functions on\nall energy scales in equilibrium problems [9] and nonequilibrium problems, where one cannot focus on lowenergy degrees of freedom anyway (see, for example, the\ntime-dependent Kondo model [13] or the Kondo model\nwith voltage bias [14]).\nWe will now utilize these features to develop an analogue of canonical perturbation theory in classical mechanics for quantum many-body problems. The general\nsetup is described by the diagram in Fig. 1, where |\u03a8i i\nis some initial non-thermal state whose time evolution\none is interested in. However, instead of following its full\ntime evolution it is more convenient to study the real\ntime evolution of a given observable A. This is done by\ntransforming the observable into the diagonal basis in\nFig. 1 (forward transformation):\ndO(B)\n= [\u03b7(B), O(B)] ,\ndB\n\n(2)\n\nwith the initial condition O(B = 0) = A. The central observation is that one can now solve the real time\nevolution with respect to the energy-diagonal H\u0303 exactly,\nthereby avoiding any errors that grow proportional to\ntime (i.e., secular terms): this yields \u00c3(t). Now since\nthe initial quantum state is given in the B = 0 basis, one undoes the basis change by integrating (2) from\n\nFIG. 1: The forward-backward transformation scheme induces a non-perturbative solution of the Heisenberg equations\nof motion for an operator. U denotes the full unitary transformation that relates the B = 0 to the B = \u221e basis.[15]\n\nB = \u221e to B = 0 (backward transformation) with the\ninitial condition O(B = \u221e) = \u00c3(t). One therefore effectively generates a new non-perturbative scheme for solving the Heisenberg equations of motion for an operator,\nA(t) = eiHt A(0) e\u2212iHt , in exact analogy to canonical\nperturbation theory. Notice that it is the last step of the\nbackward transformation that distinguishes this scheme\nfrom the flow equation evaluation of equilibrium correlation functions [9]: The equilibrium ground state or thermal states are in fact more easily expressed in the B = \u221e\nbasis (since H\u0303 is energy-diagonal) than in the B = 0 (interacting) basis. It should be mentioned that the same\nforward-backward transformation scheme with respect to\nsome given initial quantum state has recently also been\nsuccessfully employed by Cazalilla [16] for studying the\nnonequilibrium Luttinger model. The main difference to\nour approach is that the bosonized Luttinger Hamiltonian becomes quadratic, which makes it possible to work\nout the unitary transformation exactly in [16] (the same\nholds in [13]): therefore stability questions regarding secular terms for a generic interacting system do not arise,\nwhich are the main focus of our work.\nWe now illustrate the general idea of our approach\nby studying the spin-boson model, which serves as a\nparadigm in dissipative quantum physics and for qubit\ndynamics (for a review see, for example, [17]):\nH=\u2212\n\nX\nX\n\u2206\n1\n\u03c3x + \u03c3z\n\u03bbk (b\u2020k + bk ) +\n\u03c9k b\u2020k bk .

The differential\n\nequations describing this flow take the following form:\n\u0011\nX \u0010 (y)\ndh\n(z)\n= \u2212\n\u03b7k (\u03c7k + \u03c7\u0304k ) + \u03b7k (\u03bck + \u03bc\u0304k )\ndB\nk\nX (y)\n\u22124\n\u03b7k Ckl (\u03c7l + \u03c7\u0304l )\nk,l\n\n\u0011\nX\u0010\nd\u03c7k\n(y)\n= 2 h \u03b7k +\n\u03b7kl (\u03c7l + \u03c7\u0304l ) + \u03b7lk (\u03c7\u0304l \u2212 \u03c7l )\ndB\nl\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nd\u03bck\n(z)\n= 2 h \u03b7k \u2212\n\u03b7lk (\u03bcl + \u03bc\u0304l ) + \u03b7kl (\u03bcl \u2212 \u03bc\u0304l )\ndB\nl\n\u0011\nX \u0010 (y)\nd\u03b1\n(z)\n=\n\u03b7k (\u03bck + \u03bc\u0304k ) + \u03b7k (\u03c7k + \u03c7\u0304k ) , (10)\ndB\nk\n\nwith the initial conditions h(B = 0) = 1, \u03c7k (B = 0) =\n\u03bck (B = 0) = \u03b1(B = 0) = 0. For \u2206 \u2208 supp J(\u03c9) the\ndef\n\nobservable decays completely, h\u0303 = h(B = \u221e) = 0, implying decoherence [9]. The ground state expectation\ndef\n\nvalue of \u03c3x is then given by \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1(B = \u221e).\nFor real time evolution problems we now solve the\nHeisenberg equations of motion in the diagonal basis,\n\u03c3\u0303z (t) = eiH\u0303t \u03c3\u0303z e\u2212iH\u0303t . The result is straightforward\n\u0001\n \u0303 + i \u03bc\u0303k (0) sin(\u2206t)\n \u0303 e\u2212i\u03c9k t (11)\n\u03c7\u0303k (t) = \u03c7\u0303k (0) cos(\u2206t)\n\u0001\n \u0303 + i \u03c7\u0303k (0) sin(\u2206t)\n \u0303 e\u2212i\u03c9k t ,\n\u03bc\u0303k (t) = \u03bc\u0303k (0) cos(\u2206t)\nwhile h\u0303 and \u03b1\u0303 remain unchanged. In complete analogy to\ncanonical perturbation theory, we next undo the unitary\ntransformation (2). The values of h\u0303, \u03b1\u0303, \u03c7\u0303k (t), \u03bc\u0303k (t) are\nused as initial values in the system of differential equa-\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: Ground state expectation value of \u03c3x : Comparison of\nflow equation results (curves) and NRG data (squares) from\n[19] for an Ohmic bath with damping \u03b1.

This yields h(t), \u03b1(t), \u03c7k (t), \u03bck (t), which\nparametrize the time-evolved operator \u03c3x ,\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u03c3x (t) = h(t) \u03c3x + \u03c3z\n\u03c7k (t) bk + \u03c7\u0304k (t) b\u2020k\nk\n\n+ \u03b1(t) + i\u03c3y\n\nX\u0010\nk\n\n\u03bck (t) bk \u2212 \u03bc\u0304k (t) b\u2020k\n\n\u0011\n\n(12)\n\nin the original basis of the problem. Thereby the\nforward-backward transformation scheme induces a nonperturbative solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion, compare Fig. 1.\nFor the purposes of this Letter, we focus on the numerical solution of the above differential equations by\ndiscretizing the bosonic bath with O(103 ) modes (notice\nthat an approximate analytical treatment is equally possible). The initial quantum state |\u03a8i i is taken as spin\nup, h\u03a8i |\u03c3z |\u03a8i i = +1, with a relaxed bath with respect\nto this fixed spin. This yields Ckk\u2032 = \u03bbk \u03bbk\u2032 /4\u03c9k \u03c9k\u2032 . We\nhave implemented the numerical solution for all components of the spin degree of freedom. In order to assess the\naccuracy of our approach, the time evolution of h\u03c3z (t) is\nshown in Fig. 2 and compared with TD-NRG data for two\nvalues of the discretization parameter \u039b. One finds excellent agreement except for very long time scales (shown\nin the insets of Fig. 2), where the TD-NRG discretization error becomes noticeable (since the curves depend\non \u039b). The flow equation solution for the observable\nh\u03c3x (t)i shows that it approaches its flow equation equilibrium expectation value h\u03c3x iGS with an absolute error\nbelow 10\u22122 for long times. A comparison of h\u03c3x iGS with\nexact numerical results using NRG [19] in Fig. 3 again\nshows very good agreement.\nSumming up, we have shown how to implement an\nanalogous scheme to canonical perturbation theory for\nquantum many-body systems. Using a simple but nontrivial example, we could demonstrate that the wellestablished advantages of canonical perturbation theory\n\nversus naive perturbation theory carry over to our unitary perturbation approach as well, in particular the absence of secular terms in real time evolution problems.\nOur results are stable in the long-time limit (see Figs. 2,3)\nand can be improved systematically in a uniform manner\n(as a function of time) by higher orders of the calculation.\nThe underlying scheme of infinitesimal unitary transformations permits to study non-perturbative effects [20].\nSimilar to the role of canonical perturbation theory in\nanalytical mechanics, our approach should be useful for\nother real time evolution problems from impurity systems\nto lattice models in quantum many-body physics [21].\nWe thank F.
