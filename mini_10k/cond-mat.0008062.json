For lower density the ground\nstate will be ferromagnetic.\n\nPACS Numbers: 73.20Dx, 75.10-b, 67.8Jd\nThe uniform system of electrons is one of the basic\nmodels of condensed matter physics. In this paper, we\nreport on the first exact calculations of the spin Hamiltonian in the low density 2 dimensional Wigner crystal\n(2dWC) near melting. This system is realized experimentally with electrons confined at an semiconductor MOSFET's and heterostructures [1], and for electrons on the\nsurface of liquid helium [2].\nA homogeneous charged system is characterized by two\nparameters: the density given in terms of rs = a/a0 =\n(m\u2217 /m\u01eb)(\u03c0a20 \u03c1)\u22121/2 and the energy in effective Rydbergs\nRy \u2217 = (m\u2217 /me \u01eb2 )Ry where m\u2217 is the effective mass and\n\u01eb the dielectric constant. Figure 1 summarizes the 2d\nphase diagram. At low density (large rs ) the potential\nenergy dominates over the kinetic energy and the system forms a perfect triangular lattice, the Wigner crystal\n[3]. Tanatar and Ceperley [4] determined that melting at\nzero temperature occurs at rs \u2243 37 \u00b1 5. Recent calculations [5] have shown that the low temperature phase is\nfree of point defects for densities with rs \u2265 50 but defects may be present very near melting. At densities for\nrs \u2265 100 the melting is classical, and occurs for temperatures Tmelt = 2Ry/(\u0393crs ) where \u0393c \u2248 137 [6].\nWe determine the spin-spin interaction in the Wigner\ncrystal, using Thouless' [8] theory of exchange. According to this theory, in the absence of point defects, at low\ntemperatures the spins will be governed by a Hamiltonian\nof the form:\nX\nHspin = \u2212\n(1)\n(\u22121)P JP P\u0302spin\n\nsurprisingly, it has been found [11] that in both 2d and 3d\nsolid 3 He, exchanges of 2, 3 and 4 particles have roughly\nthe same order of magnitude and must all be taken into\naccount. This is known as the multiple spin exchange\nmodel(MSE).\n\nFIG. 1. Phase diagram. The estimated melting line is\nbased on Lindemann's criteria [7]. The long-dashed line represents the Debye temperature. The dotted line is \u03b8, the short\ndashed line is Jc . The vertical line is the estimated zero temperature ferromagnetic (F) transition.\n\nP\n\nwhere the sum is over all cyclic (ring) exchanges described by a cyclic permutation P , JP is its exchange frequency and P\u0302spin is the corresponding spin exchange operator. Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) as suggested\nby Thouless [8] and Roger [9]has proved to be the only\nreliable way to calculate these parameters. The theory\nand computational method have been tested thoroughly\non the magnetic properties of bulk helium obtaining excellent agreement with measured properties [10]. Rather\n\nA WKB calculation of the exchange frequencies in the\n2dWC by Roger [9] predicted that the three electron J3\nnearest neighbor exchange would dominate, leading to\na ferromagnetic(F) ground state. It has been recently\npointed out [12] that if the 2dWC can be stabilized by\n1\n\n\fdisorder to higher densities, a transition to an antiferromagnetic(AF) phase will occur. Although the 1/r interaction is characterized as 'soft', in the 2dWC the two\nparticle pair correlation function for the electron system\nis quite similar to that of solid 3 He supporting the idea\nthat multiple exchanges could be important in the 2dWC\nnear melting.\nThe method of determining the exchange frequency in\nquantum crystals has been given earlier [10,13,14]. One\ncomputes the free energy necessary to make an exchange\nbeginning with one arrangement of particles to lattice\nsites Z and ending on a permuted arrangement P Z:\nFP (\u03b2) = Q(P, \u03b2)/Q(I, \u03b2) = tanh(JP (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b20 )).\n\ntion functions would be signaled by FP (\u03b2) not described\nby Eq. (2). Except for rs < 50 where our calculations are\ntoo unstable to make definite predictions, we observed no\nproblems of convergence.\nFigure 2 shows the ring exchanges considered here. Except near melting these exchanges give rise to most of the\nthermodynamic properties. Note that we consider the 6particle parallelogram (6p) exchange, which is not taken\ninto account in solid 3 He. We have also calculated several 2-5 particle exchanges having next-nearest neighbor\nexchanges and all possible 6 particle nearest-neighbor exchanges for 50 \u2264 rs \u2264 75, but because their magnitudes\nare much smaller, we do not report those results.\n\n(2)\n\nHere Q(P, \u03b2) is the partition function corresponding to\nan exchange P at a temperature 1/\u03b2. I is the identity\npermutation. Note that these paths are of \"distinguishable\" particles since Fermi statistics are implemented\nthrough the spin Hamilitonian in Eq. (1). We determine the function FP (\u03b2) using a method which directly\ncalculates free energy differences and thereby determines\nJP and \u03b20 . The only new feature with respect to the\n3\nHe calculations is the method of treating the long-range\npotential. We use the standard Ewald breakup [9] and\ntreat the short-range part using the exact pair action\n[10] and the long-range k-space term using the primitive approximation. We used a hexagonal unit cell with\nperiodic boundary conditions, most calculations containing 36 electrons. Checks with up to 144 electrons did\nnot change the results within the statistical errors. The\nnumber of particles is not as important in the 2dWC as\nin solid 3 He because the 1/r interaction suppresses the\nlong wavelength charge fluctuations.\n\n1/2\n\nFIG. 3. Exchange frequencies versus rs . The solid line\nis 10\u22123 of the kinetic energy.\n\nOur calculated exchange frequencies vary rapidly with\ndensity as shown in fig. (3). One can see that they are\nmuch less than the zero point energy of the electrons, thus\njustifying the use of Thouless' theory. The WKB method\n[11] where one approximates the Path Integral in Eq. (2)\nby the single most probable path, explains most of this\ndensity dependence. In the 2dWC, the WKB expression\nfor the exchange frequency [9,12] is:\n\nFIG. 2. Considered exchanges.\n\nWe performed calculations for the densities rs =\n{45, 50, 60, 75, 100, 140, 200}. We found accurate results\nusing a \"time-step\" for the descretized imaginary time\n3/2\npath integrals of \u03c4 \u2264 0.3rs and extrapolated to the\n\u03c4 = 0 limit using Jp (\u03c4 ) = Jp (0) + Jp\u2032 \u03c4 3 . The inverse\ntemperature \u03b2 in Eq. (2 )must be larger than the values\ndetermined by melting and twice the exchange \"time\"\n3/2\n\u03b20 \u223c 5rs . We have determined the exchange frequencies with an accuracy between 1.5% and 6% independent\nof their magnitude or the number of exchanging electrons\nthough the computer time increases with the number of\nexchanging electrons. Breakdown of Thouless' theory\ncaused by many states contributing to the ratio of parti-\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nJP = AP (rs )bP rs\u22125/4 e\u2212bP rs .\n1/2\n\n(3)\n\nHere bP rs is the minimum value of the action integral along the path connecting P Z with Z. The 3 particle exchange exponent is the smallest indicating that as\nrs \u2192 \u221e, J3 will dominate and the system will have a\n2\n\n\fferromagnetic ground state. However, note that in fig.\n(3) J2 > J3 for rs \u2264 90. We observe a more rapid increase in all the exchange frequencies than predicted by\nEq. (3) for rs < 100 caused by non-linear fluctuations\nabout the classical path. Near melting the spread in exchange frequencies is much less than in the low density\nlimit.\n\nbe counted separately. A recent calculation [15] directly\nevaluates J2 in the high density regime, 5 \u2264 rs \u2264 45, by\nnumerically solving for the difference between the even\nand odd parity 2-electron energies. In those calculations,\nthe spectator electrons were fixed at their lattice sites\nand the 2 exchanging electrons had vanishing wavefunctions outside a rectangle centered around the exchange.\nAt rs = 45 a direct comparison shows their result is 2.3\ntimes larger than that obtained with PIMC. This result\nis expected because of the additional localization caused\nby the spectator electrons fluctuating into the exchanging\nregion.\nHaving determined the exchange frequency, one is left\nwith the spin Hamiltonian of Eq. (1). This is a nontrivial many-body problem which we will not discuss\nin detail here. For spin 1/2 systems, J2 and J3 contribute only with a nearest neighbor Heisenberg term:\nJ2eff = J2 \u22122J3 . This term is negative (ferromagnetic) but\napproaches zero near melting. For convenience we use J4\nas a reference to fix the overall scale of the magnetic energy. Neglecting J6p , the Hamiltonian has 3 remaining\nparameters J2eff /J4 , J5 /J4 and J6h /J4 . The dependence\nof these ratios on density is shown in fig. (5).\n\nFIG. 4. The prefactor of the exchange frequencies, AP ,\nsee Eq. (3) versus density. All prefactors go to a constant\nfor rs > 100 indicating that exchange frequencies are dominated by a single path (WKB limit). The curves are fits as\ndescribed in the text.\n\nFigure (4) shows density dependence of the prefactor,\nAP . The prefactors are larger than unity as expected\n[12] (our\u221adefinition of Ap differs from ref. [12] by a factor\nof 1.63/ 2\u03c0). We observe that the prefactor is roughly\nconstant for rs > 100 but rises rapidly as the system\napproaches the melting density. We are unaware of any\nwork that definitively establishes the form of the correction to the WKB formula. A good fit was obtained with\nthe function AP (rs ) = AP (0)(1 + (rP /rs )3 ) to determine\nbP , AP (0) and rP . The exponents are close to the WKB\nvalues, only differing significantly for the 2-particle exchange.\n\nFIG. 5. Spin Phase diagram as a function of exchange ratios. The dotted line is the flow of spin hamiltonian space\nversus rs (lower numbers); also shown the are estimated\nvalues of J6h /J4 (upper numbers). The solid lines are the\nlimit of the ferromagnetic phase according to ED [17] at\nJ6h /J4 = {0.2, 0.4, 0.6}. The 2dWC crosses into the F region for rs \u2248 175. The (\u22c6) are empirical estimates of the spin\nHamiltonian of 2d 3 He at several densities [19].\n\nThe prefactor for J2 is twice as large as the other\nexchanges. One might think that since one cannot observe the difference in pair exchanges in the initial and\nfinal spins, the sense of the exchange would not matter. Our results show that the 2 orientations of 2 particle exchange, clockwise and counter-clockwise, should\n3\n\n\fsurements of the second layer of 3 He absorbed on grafoil\n[19] as shown in fig. (5). The existence of these two related spin systems should allow a fuller understanding of\nthis remarkable spin liquid. Such an equivalence could\narise from an underlying virtual vacancy-interstitial (VI)\nmechanism [11] giving rise to ring exchanges. In this\nmodel the prefactor of the exchange is controlled by the\nrate of VI formation (non-universal) but the ratios of the\nvarious ring exchanges arises from geometry of the triangular lattice and from the attraction of point defects\n(universal). We have recently determined [5] that the VI\nformation energy vanishes at melting in the 2dWC. This\nis consistent with the fact that the various JP increase\nrapidly near melting.\nIn summary, we find that the magnetic interactions are\ncharacterized by a frustrated spin order. Application of a\nmagnetic field [20] transforms the exchange frequencies to\nJp e2\u03c0ieB\u22a5 ap /h where ap is the area of the exchange (see\ntable I) and B\u22a5 the magnetic field. Experiments with\nmagnetic fields will allow exploration of this AharonovBohm effect and thereby provide direct information on\nring exchanges.\nThe semiconductor realizations of the 2dWC have significant disorder which can stabilize localized electronic\nstates at higher densities than in the clean system [21].\nOne can also stabilize the Wigner crystal at higher densities using bilayers [22]. Exchange frequencies in those\nsystems including effects of layer thickness and the exchange properties of point defects could be calculated\nwith the present method.\nThis research was funded by NSF DMR 98-02373, the\nCNRS-University of Illinois exchange agreement, support\nby Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o\nPaulo (FAPESP) and the Dept. of Physics at the University of Illinois. We used the computational facilities\nat the NCSA.\n\nHigh temperature series expansions [16] determine the\nthe specific heat CV and magnetic susceptibility \u03c70 /\u03c7 for\ntemperatures kB T \u226b JP . The susceptibility is given by:\n\u03c70 /\u03c7 = T \u2212 \u03b8 + B/T . . . and the specific heat CV /N kB =\n(3Jc /2T )2 + . . . where the Curie-Weiss constant is given\nby \u03b8 = \u22123(J2eff + 3J4 \u2212 5J5 + 5/8J6h + 15/4J6p ) with a\nquadratic expression of the J's for Jc . These two constants which set the scale of the temperature where exchange is important are shown as a dotted and dashed\nlines on fig. (1). Both \u03b8 and Jc decrease very rapidly at\nlow density showing that experiments must be done at\nrs \u2264 100 if spin effects are to be at a reasonable temperature, e.g. Tc > 0.1mK (assuming \u01eb = m\u2217 = 1). Note\nthat \u03b8 changes from positive to negative at rs \u2248 130.\nThe zero temperature state can be studied by exact\ndiagonalization (ED) of an N site system. (The present\nlimitation is N <\n\u223c 36.) Here we focus on the zero temperature transition from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic state. An estimate [17] of the critical transition\nparameters is shown on fig.(5). The ferromagnetic phase\nis obtained only at very low density: we estimate the the\nF-AF transition for the 2dWC will occur at rs = 175\u00b110.\n(Note that this estimate does not include the effect of J6p ;\nthis will increase the stability of the antiferromagnetic region to roughly rs = 200.)\nAt higher density, the frustration between large cycle\nexchanges (4-6 body loops) results in a disordered spin\nstate. For example, the point (J2eff /J4 = \u22122, J5 = 0,\nJ6h = 0), close to the parameters at rs = 100, is a spin\nliquid with a gap to all excitations [17]: The spin liquid\nproperties can be understood from a resonance valance\nbond model with ordering into spin-1 diamond plaquettes. The breakup of the plaquettes is responsible for\na low temperature peak on the specific heat. A second\nhigh temperature peak develops at a temperature T \u223c Jc ,\nshown as a dotted line on fig. (1).\nWe find that at higher densities (rs < 100), the trajectory of the MSE models parallels the F-AF phase line,\nwith the possibility of a re-entrant ferromagnetic phase\nfor rs < 40. Note that QMC calculations [18] of the normal fermi liquid at rs = 30 show that the ferromagnetic\nphase has a slightly lower energy that the unpolarized\nphase. Hence both the high density 2dWC and the low\ndensity electron fluid are characterized by a spin Hamiltonian which is nearly ferromagnetic.\nWe note a remarkable similarity between the exchange\nparameters of the 2dWC to those extrapolated from mea-\n\nP\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6h\n6p\n\nbP\n1.612\n1.525\n1.656\n1.912\n1.790\n2.136\n\nAP (0)\n2.11\n0.91\n1.42\n1.39\n1.12\n6.24\n\nrP\n44\n47\n45\n60\n59\n38\n\naP\n2.07(1)\n3.07(2)\n4.11(2)\n7.04(3)\n5.09(2)\n\nTABLE I.
