The particles move independently as long as their\nmovements do not violate some given rules describing the relative position of the particles; moves that\nviolate the rules are not realized. The goal of this paper is to study qualitative properties, as recurrence,\ntransience, ergodicity, and positive rate of escape of these Markov processes.\n\nKeywords: spider walk, recurrence, transience, rate of escape\nAMS 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 60J27, 60K99\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet us start with an informal description of a particular spider walk. Imagine there are two\nparticles performing simple random walks on a graph in continuous time. These particles are\ntied together with a rope of a certain length, say s. As long as the rope is not tight their\nmovements are independent. If the rope is tight (particles have a distance s of each other) the\nrope prevents the particles to jump away from each other.\nMore generally we can think of a spider walk as a system of k, k \u2208 N, interacting particles\nthat move independently according to some Markov process as long as their movement does not\nviolate some given rules concerning their relative positions. If a move of a particle violates a rule\nthe particle stays at its position and waits until the particle jumps to another location or the\nmovement of another particle change the relative position of the particles. In other words, for\neach particle in some position x and each neighbouring site y there is an exponential clock with\nrate q(x, y) independent of the rest of the process. Say the clock associated to a particle in x\nand to the edge xy rings then the particle moves to y if the new position accords with the rules\nand stays in x otherwise. A formal construction is given in Subsection 2.1.\n1\n\n\fThis note addresses questions about the qualitative characteristics of the original random\nwalk and the spider walk. In particular, we are interested if the rope may change properties like\nrecurrence vs. transience, ergodicity vs. non-ergodicity and positive speed vs. zero speed. The\nfirst observation that one may make is that a spider walk can be described as a random walk\nof one particle on some appropriate graph that we call the spider graph. Some of the above\nquestions may then be answered in comparing the two graphs. For example consider the simple\nrandom walk (SRW) as the underlying Markov process. Then, if the original graph and the spider\ngraph are roughly isometric, the SRW is recurrent if and only if the spider walk is recurrent. In\nthe more general setting of reversible Markov processes one can compare the two processes by\ndint of rough embeddings, see Definition 3.1 and Theorem 3.1. Let us denote QS for the Markov\nprocess on the spider graph GS , i.e., for the interpretation of the spider walk as a one particle\nwalk. If Q and QS are roughly equivalent the original process and the spider walk are either both\nrecurrent or both transient. This is the case if the underlying process and the rules are transitive,\nsee Theorem 3.2. The same holds true if we leave the setting of transitivity but assume that\nthe conductances are bounded, see Theorem 3.4. If we drop the hypotheses on transitivity and\nbounded conductances a transient Markov process can bear a recurrent spider, see Example 4.1,\nand a transient spider can originate from a recurrent Markov process, see Example 3.1.\nThere is no analogue to Theorem 3.2 treating positive- and null-recurrence since there exists no positive recurrent quasi-transitive Markov chain. (This follows from Theorem 1.18,\nLemma 3.25 and Theorem 3.26 in [8]). In other words, every transitive spider is null recurrent or transient. In the Examples 3.2, 3.3, and 4.1 we describe situations where the random\nwalk and the spider walk have different ergodic behaviours.\nA natural follow up question is whether the rate of escape is positive or zero. For this let us\nfirst consider SRW on graphs with a positive anchored isoperimetric constant. It is known that\npositivity of the anchored isoperimetric constant implies positivity of the speed. By observing\nthat the anchored isoperimetric constant of G is positive if and only if the one of the spider\ngraph is positive we obtain for this class of graphs that the speed of the spider is positive. We\nbelieve that on transitive graphs the speed of the SRW is positive if and only if the one of the\nspider is positive. This is not true for transitive random walks in general: see Example 4.1\nwhere the underlying random walk has positive speed but the spider walk has zero speed and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we study spiders with bounded span on the integers (with drift) and on\nhomogeneous trees and observe two different qualitative behaviours: while the speed V (s) of the\nspider on the line converges to the speed of the random walk as s goes to infinity, the speed of\nthe spider walk on the tree converges to 0 as the span increases. In both cases the speed of the\nspider walk is strictly smaller than the speed of the underlying process. While this is not true in\ngeneral, see Example 4.1, we conjecture it to hold for SRW on transitive graphs. We conclude\nwith some questions concerning structural properties of graphs and the behaviour of the spider\nwalk.\nOur model and results have also a motivation coming from evolutionary dynamics and molecular cybernetics of multi-pedal molecular spiders, compare with [1]. There, different mappings\n\n2\n\n\fbetween various models of spiders and simple excursion processes are established. We also want\nto mention [3] where the spider walk in random environment on Z is studied.\nLet us comment on some nomenclature. A Markov chain (process) is called a random walk\nif the process is somehow adapted to the structure of the graph. Furthermore, we switch freely\nbetween the continuous time and discrete time version (jump chain) of the process. Due to the\ndescription of our particle system as spider, the particles are frequently called legs. In most of\nthe basic definitions and results concerning random walks and reversible Markov chains we follow\nthe two monographs [7] and [8] where more details and references can be found.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSpider walk\nDefinition\n\nLet G = (V, E) be a rooted, undirected, connected graph with vertex set V, edge set E, and root\no. As usual d(*, *) denotes the graph distance and deg(x) the degree of the vertex x. We often\nidentify the graph with its vertex set and write x \u2208 G for a vertex x. A Markov process (Xt )t\u22650\nstarting in o is defined on G = (V, E) through a transition matrix Q = (q(x, y))x,y\u2208G . We always\nassume that the rates are bounded and that G and Q are adapted, i.e., q(x, y) = q(y, x) = 0 if\nand only if xy 6\u2208 E. This assumption in particular implies, since the graph is connected, that\nthe Markov process is irreducible.\nWe define the spider walk with k legs in a very general setting. We distinguish between the\ndifferent legs and describe the spider walk through St = (S1,t , . . . , Sk,t ) where Si,t stands for\nthe position of the ith leg at time t. For each x \u2208 V let us fix L(x) which is a finite subset of\n\u039b(x) := {(x1 , . . . , xk ) : x1 = x, xi \u2208 V }. We call L(x) the set of local configurations of the\nspider at position x and write x = (x1 , . . . , xk ) for its elements. We define the transition rates\nQS from x = (x1 , . . . , xk ) to y = (y1 , . . . , yk ) as follows:\n(\nq(xi , yi ) if there exists exactly one index i such that xi 6= yi\nq S (x, y) =\n0\notherwise.\nTogether with some initial position x\u0304 of the spider, the sets L(x), x \u2208 V , and the transition\nmatrix Q define the spider walk (St )t\u22650 through QS . Furthermore, we denote GS = (V S , E S ),\nwhere\n[\nVS =\nL(x) and E S := {(x, y) : q S (x, y) > 0}.\nx\n\nGS\n\nWe call\nthe spider graph of the spider walk (St )t\u22650 . Its root is x\u0304. Sometimes it will be\nconvenient to write the vertices of the spider graph also as {(`i (x)) : i \u2208 {1, . . . , |L(x)|}, x \u2208 G},\nwhere 1, . . . , |L(x)| corresponds to some enumeration of the set L(x).\nSince in this general definition the spider walk is not necessarily irreducible (even though the\nprocess Q is irreducible) we will concentrate on two types of spider walks: namely spider with\nbounded span and transitive spiders.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nSpider with bounded span\n\nWe consider a spider walk with k legs and span bounded by s, i.e., the maximal distance between\nthe k legs does not exceed s. For each x let\nL(x) = {(x1 , . . . , xk ) : x1 = x, max d(xi , xj ) \u2264 s, xi 6= xj }.\ni,j\n\nAs a starting position x\u0304 we may choose x\u03041 , . . . , x\u0304k as a non-intersecting path of length k starting\nfrom o. Observe hereby that we do not allow two legs to be at the same position.\nExample 2.1. Simple random walk on Z and 2-leg spider with s = 3. We assume the first leg to\nbe the leftmost leg. In this case L(x) = {(x, x + 1), (x, x + 2), (x, x + 3)}, compare with Figure\n1. A part of the corresponding spider graph is drawn in Figure 2.\n(x, x + 1)\n\nx\n\n(x, x + 2)\n\nx+1 x+2 x+3\n\nx\n\n(x, x + 3)\n\nx+1 x+2 x+3\n\nx\n\nx+1 x+2 x+3\n\nFigure 1: The three possible local configurations for a spider with bounded span (k = 2, s = 3)\nat position x.\n\n(x + 3, x + 5)\n\n(x, x + 1)\n\n(x, x + 2)\nx\n\nx+1\n\nx+2\n\nx+3\n\nFigure 2: Part of the spider graph of a spider with bounded span (k = 2, s = 3)\nNote that a spider walk with bounded span is a priori not irreducible; e.g. the spider on Z\nwith 2 legs and span bounded by 1. A natural assumption that ensures irreducibility is k \u2264 s.\n\n2.3\n\nTransitive spider\n\nLet us recall the definition of transitive graphs. A graph G = (V, E) is said to be transitive\nif the automorphism group AU T (G) acts transitively on G, i.e., for all x, y \u2208 G there exist a\n4\n\n\f\u03b3 \u2208 AU T (G) such that y = \u03b3x. Informally spoken: the graph G looks the same from every\nvertex. Let Q be a transition matrix describing a Markov process on G and AU T (G, Q) be\nthe group of all \u03b3 \u2208 AU T (G) which satisfy q(\u03b3x, \u03b3y) = q(x, y) for all vertices x, y in G. We\nsay the Markov process Q is transitive if the group AU T (G, Q) acts transitively on G. We can\nextend this idea to the set of local configurations L(x). Define AU T (G, Q, L) as the group of\nall \u03b3 \u2208 AU T (G, Q) which satisfy L(\u03b3x) = L(x) for all x \u2208 G. We say the spider (G, Q, L) is\ntransitive if AU T (G, Q, L) acts transitively on G.\nExample 2.2. Let us define a spider with 3 legs on the line Z with the following set of local\nconfigurations:\nL(x) = {(x, x + 1, x + 2), (x, x + 1, x + 3), (x, x + 2, x + 3), (x, x + 2, x + 4)}.\nThis defines a transitive spider since L(x) is just the translation of L(0). Observe, that this\nspider is not of bounded span since we excluded the local configurations (x, x + 1, x + 4) and\n(x, x + 3, x + 4).\nExample 2.3. Every spider with bounded span on a transitive graph is a transitive spider. For\nexample consider the 2-leg spider with bounded span s = 2 on the direct product G of Z3 and Z.\nElements of G are written as a tuple (u, x) with u \u2208 Z3 and x \u2208 Z. The set of local configurations\ncan then be written as\nL((u, x)) = {((u, x), (u \u00b1 1, x)), ((u, x), (u \u00b1 2, x)),\n((u, x), (u, x \u00b1 1)), ((u, x), (u \u2212 1, x \u00b1 1)), ((u, x), (u + 1, x \u00b1 1))}.\nIn Figure 3 the position of the first leg is labelled by the black ball and the possible positions of\nthe second leg are indicated by the grey balls.\n\nFigure 3: Set of local configurations of a spider with bounded span (k = s = 2) on the direct\nproduct Z3 \u00d7 Z.\nLet {`1 , . . . , `|L(o)| } be an arbitrary enumeration of L(o). This induces an enumeration on\nthe local configuration at position x as follows: choose some \u03b3 \u2208 AU T (G, Q, L) with \u03b3o = x and\nenumerate L(x) such that \u03b3`i (o) = `i (x).\nA graph is called quasi-transitive if the automorphism group acts with finitely many orbits.\nRecall when a group \u0393 acts on a set G, the group orbit of an element x \u2208 G is defined as\n5\n\n\f\u0393x := {\u03b3x : \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393}. Let Oi be the orbits of AU T (G, Q, L) on G. The vertex set of the factor\ngraph consists of the orbits and two orbits Oi and Oj are connected by an edge if there exists\nu \u2208 Oi and v \u2208 Oj such that uv \u2208 E. We can define the factor chain on the factor graph by\nP\np\u0303(Oi , Oj ) = w\u2208Oj p(x, \u03c9), where x \u2208 Oi is arbitrary.\nDue to the above definition, the spider graph GS of a transitive spider is a quasi-transitive\ngraph and hence its geometry can be compared with those of the underlying graph G. One\npossibility of comparing two different graphs is the concept of rough-isometry. Equip two graphs\nG = (V, E) and G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) with their natural metrics d and d0 . A mapping \u03c6 : V \u2192 V 0 is\ncalled rough isometry if there are positive constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that\n\u03b1\u22121 d(x, y) \u2212 \u03b2 \u2264 d0 (\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)) \u2264 \u03b1d(x, y) + \u03b2\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 V\n\nand such that every vertex in G0 is within distance \u03b2 from the image of G. In this case we say\nthat the two graphs (or metric spaces) (G, d) and (G0 , d0 ) are roughly isometric.\nLemma 2.1. Let (G, Q, L) be a transitive spider walk. Then G and the spider graph GS are\nroughly isometric.\nProof. Denote dS the usual graph distance in GS . Define \u03c6 : V \u2192 V S , x 7\u2192 `1 (x). Clearly,\nd(x, y) \u2264 dS (`1 (x), `1 (y)) for all x, y \u2208 V . Due to the transitiveness we have for all x, y \u2208 V\nthat dS (`1 (x), `1 (y)) \u2264 \u03b1d(x, y) with \u03b1 = dS (`1 (v), `1 (w)), where vw \u2208 E. Furthermore, there is\nsome constant \u03b2 such that dS (`1 (x), `i (x)) \u2264 \u03b2 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 u and all x \u2208 G.\nLemma 2.1 does not hold for general graphs, compare with the following Example 2.4.\nExample 2.4. Consider the 1-dimensional grid Z and attach to each vertex of the form 2k , k \u2208 N,\nan additional vertex. The spider graph of the 2-leg spider with span s = 2 is not quasi-isometric\nto the underlying graph since dS (`i (x), `j (x)) is not bounded for some `i , `j and x. To see this\nlet x = 2k + 2k\u22121 and `i be a configuration where the first leg is to the left of the second and `j\nwhere it is to the right of the second leg.\n\n3\n\nRecurrence and transience\n\nIn order to define recurrence and transience of a Markov process (Xt )t\u22650 (on a discrete state space\nX) it is convenient to pass to its jump chain (Yn )n\u22650 . The jump chain is the (discrete) sequence\nof states visited by the continuous-time Markov process (Xt )t\u22650 . Its transition probabilities\nP = (p(x, y))x,y\u2208X are p(x, y) := \u2212q(x, y)/q(x, x) for x 6= y and 0 if x = y. We also can\nwrite this relation as Q = R(P \u2212 I) where R is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are\n{q(x, x) : x \u2208 X} and I the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries equal to 1.\nAn irreducible Markov chain (Yn )n\u22650 is called recurrent if P(\u2203n \u2265 1 : Yn = y | Y0 = x) =\n1 for all x, y \u2208 X, otherwise it is called transient. We say the Markov process is recurrent\n(respectively, transient) if its jump chain is recurrent (respectively, transient). We say a Markov\nprocess is reversible if there exists a positive vector \u03bc such that the detailed balance condition,\n6\n\n\f\u03bc(x)q(x, y) = \u03bc(y)q(y, x), holds for all x, y \u2208 X. The reversibility of the Markov process carries\nover to its jump process: let \u03c0(x) = \u2212q(x, x)\u03bc(x), then \u03c0 is the reversible measure of (Yn )n\u22650 , i.e.,\n\u03c0(x)p(x, y) = \u03c0(y)p(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 X. In what follows we restrict us to the study of reversible\nMarkov processes. Notice that in general (if the underlying process is not reversible) the spider\nwalk may develop singular behaviour, e.g., the first leg may return infinitely many times to the\nstarting position while the spider walk itself is transient. Furthermore, the interpretation of a\nMarkov chain as an electrical network is restricted to reversible Markov chains: any reversible\nMarkov chain defines an electric network with conductances c(x, y) := \u03c0(x)p(x, y). Note that\ndue to the reversibility we have c(x, y) = c(y, x) and hence the conductances (c(x, y))xy\u2208E can\nbe seen as weights on the edges of the graph G according to which a random walker chooses its\nnext position. The resistance of an edge is defined as r(x, y) := 1/c(x, y).\nLet us first turn to transitive spiders. As an immediate consequence of Lemma 2.1 we have\nthat if the simple random walk (SRW), i.e., p(x, y) = 1/ deg(x) if xy \u2208 E or equivalently\nq(x, y) = 1 if xy \u2208 E, on a transitive graph G = (V, E) is transient then every transitive spider\non this graph is transient and if some spider is transient then the SRW is transient as well. This\nfact follows from the well-known result that rough isometries preserve recurrence and transience,\ncompare with Theorem 3.10 in [8]. In order to generalize this result to transitive spiders we use\nthe concept of rough embeddings.\nDefinition 3.1. Let G1 and G2 be electrical networks with resistances r(1) and r(2) . We say\nthat a map \u03c6 from the vertices of G1 to the vertices of G2 is a rough embedding if there are\nconstants a, b < \u221e and a map \u03a6 defined on the edges of G1 such that\na) for every edge xy in G1 , \u03a6(xy) is a non-empty simple oriented path of edges in G2 joining\n\u03c6(x) and \u03c6(y) with\nX\nr(2) (e) \u2264 ar(1) (x, y),\ne\u2208\u03a6(xy)\n\nwhere the sum is over all edges in the path \u03a6(xy).\nb) \u03a6(xy) is the reverse of \u03a6(yx)\nc) for every edge e in G2 there are no more than b edges in G1 whose image under \u03a6 contains e.\nWe call two networks roughly equivalent if there are rough embeddings in both directions.\nThere is the result of [4] stating that the type is preserved under rough embeddings.\nTheorem 3.1. If there is a rough embedding from G1 to G2 and G1 is transient, then G2 is\ntransient.\nWe are now able to prove the following\nTheorem 3.2. Let Q be a reversible and transitive Markov process on G and (G, Q, L) be an\nirreducible transitive spider. Then, Q is transient if and only if (G, Q, L) is transient.\n\n7\n\n\fProof. First we recall the following general fact. Let (X, P ) be a transitive reversible Markov\nchain with reversible measure \u03c0. For x, y \u2208 X let n such that p(n) (x, y) > 0. Then \u03c0(x)p(n) (x, y) =\n\u03c0(y)p(n) (y, x) and \u03c0(\u03b3x)p(n) (x, y) = \u03c0(\u03b3y)p(n) (y, x), with \u03b3 \u2208 AU T (X, P ). Dividing yields,\n\u03c0(\u03b3y)\n\u03c0(\u03b3x)\n\u03c0(\u03b3x)\n\u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y) and hence the function g(\u03b3) := \u03c0(x) does not depend on x. Consequently, g is an\nexponential on AU T (X, P ), i.e., g(\u03b2\u03b3) = g(\u03b2)g(\u03b3). Moreover, the function f (\u03b3) := r(\u03b3(x),\u03b3(y))\n=\nr(x,y)\n1\ng(\u03b3) is an exponential.\nLet us use the above observation for our setting. Notice that both the electrical network\nof the underlying Markov chain P and the one of the spider walk P S are restrictions of the\nelectrical network P I describing the movement of k independent particles. Denote by GI the\ngraph corresponding to P I . Since G is transitive, GI is transitive with corresponding automorphism group AU T (GI ) (take automorphisms coordinatewise translation). We can compare the\nresistances in G and GS as induced subgraphs of GI . Clearly, if some edge e is in G and GS then\nr(e) = rS (e) = rI (e). Let `l (x)`m (y) be an edge in GS . Then there exist some \u03b3 \u2208 AU T (GS ),\nv \u223c o and i, j such that `l (x) = \u03b3`i (o) and `m (y) = \u03b3`j (v). Hence,\nrS (\u03b3(`i (o)), \u03b3(`j (v)))\nf (\u03b3)rS (`i (o), `j (v))\nrS (`l (x), `m (y))\n=\n=\n:= k(i, j, v).\nr(x, y)\nr(\u03b3(o), \u03b3(v))\nf (\u03b3)r(o, v)\n\n(1)\n\nWe are now ready to apply Theorem 3.1. To do this we construct a rough embedding \u03a6 from\nG1 = G to G2 = GS . Let \u03c6 : V \u2192 V S be \u03c6(x) := `1 (x). In order to construct \u03a6 we fix some\nreference points v, w \u2208 V with vw \u2208 E and let \u03a6(vw) be some (arbitrary but fixed) shortest\npath from `1 (v) to `1 (w) in GS . For xy \u2208 E we define \u03a6(xy) as the shortest path from `1 (x) to\n`1 (y) such that \u03b3(\u03a6(xy)) = \u03a6(vw) for some \u03b3 \u2208 AU T (GS ). Due to this construction we have\nthat \u03a6(xy) is the reverse of \u03a6(yx) and due to the quasi-transitivity of GS we have that for every\nedge in the factor graph there are only finitely many edges in G whose image under \u03a6 contains e.\nWe have to check the first property:\nX\nr(S) (e) \u2264 ar(x, y),\ne\u2208\u03a6(xy)\n\nfor some a > 0. But this holds with a := |\u03a6(xy)| * max k(i, j, v) using (1).\nIt remains to construct a rough embedding from GS to G. Let \u03c6(li (x)) := x and \u03a6(li (x)lj (y)) :=\nxy, then one may verify the three properties of Definition 3.1 as in the first part.\nWe now turn to spider walks with bounded span where we use the following fact that is left\nas an exercise in [7], Proposition 2.17.\nProposition 3.3. Let G1 and G2 be two infinite roughly isometric networks with conductances\n\u22121\nc1 and c2 . If c1 , c2 , c\u22121\n1 , c2 are all bounded and the degrees in G1 and G2 are all bounded, then\nG1 is roughly equivalent to G2 .\nTheorem 3.4. Let Q be a reversible Markov process with bounded conductances and QS an\nirreducible k-leg spider walk with span s. Then, the Markov process is transient if and only if the\nspider is transient.\n8\n\n\fProof. Due to Example 2.4 we can not use the spider graph in order to show that there is a\nquasi-isometry between the two processes. We need a different encoding of the position of the\nspider walk. To do this we choose an enumeration of the vertices G in such a way that the root o\nof G corresponds to 0. The position of the spider is now defined as the closest (in graph distance)\nposition of a leg to the origin. If there are several closest positions we choose the one with the\nsmallest number in the enumeration. Analogously to Subsection 2.1 we can define another spider\ngraph with global positions x \u2208 G and the set of local configurations that we again denote by\nL(x) = {`i (x) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |L(x|)}. The fact that the conductances of the network of the spider walk\nare bounded follows from the fact that it is a subnetwork of the network describing the movement\nof k independent particles, compare with the proof of Theorem 3.2. Due to Proposition 3.3 it\nremains to show that G and the new spider graph are roughly isometric.\nFirst, we show that the distance between two local configurations `i (x) and `j (x) of the same\nglobal position is uniformly bounded. Recall that a local configuration in x can be described\nas the sequence x = x1 , . . . , xk . We call a configuration lined if d(xi , xi+1 ) = 1 for 1 \u2264 i < k.\nObserve that it takes at most k(s + k) steps to get from `i (x) to any lined configuration in x.\nConsequently, since this procedure is invertible we obtain that\ndS (`i (x), `j (x)) \u2264 2k(s + k),\nwhere dS is the graph distance in the new spider graph. Second, observe that for each x and y\nthere exists some i\u2217 and j \u2217 such that dS (`i\u2217 (x), `j \u2217 (y)) \u2264 kd(x, y) and hence\ndS (`i (x), `j (y)) \u2264 kd(x, y) + 4k(s + k), \u2200`i (x), `j (y).\nEventually, rough isometry follows as in the proof of Lemma 2.1 .\nIf we drop the hypotheses on transitivity in Theorem 3.2 or bounded conductances in Theorem 3.4 a transient Markov chain can bear a recurrent spider, compare with Example 4.1 in\nSection 4, and a transient spider can originate from a recurrent Markov chain, compare with\nExample 3.1.\nExample 3.1. Recurrent Markov chain and transient spider walk.\nWe consider an example of a Lamperti random walk, that is a nearest neighbour random walk\n(Yn )n\u22650 on N with asymptotic zero drift. The mean drift of (Yn )n\u22650 is defined as \u03bc(x) =\nE[Yn+1 \u2212 Yn | Yn = x] and is supposed to go to 0 as n goes to \u221e. There is the following\ncriterion, due to [6], for recurrence and transience in terms of the mean drift, see Theorem 3.6.1\n1\n(i)-(ii) in [2] : If there exists a number B such that \u03bc(x) \u2264 2x\nfor x \u2265 B then the Markov chain\n\u03b8\n(Yn )n\u22650 is recurrent. On the other hand if for some B and \u03b8 > 1 we have \u03bc(x) \u2265 2x\nfor x \u2265 B,\nthen the Markov chain is transient.\nSince (Yn )n\u22650 is a nearest neighbour walk we have q(x, x \u2212 1) = 1 \u2212 q(x, x + 1) \u2208 (0, 1) and\nhence that \u03bc(x) = 2q(x, x + 1) \u2212 1. Letting q(x, x + 1) = (2x + 1)/(4x) it follows that the Markov\nchain is recurrent since \u03bc(x) = 1/(2x).\nNow, consider the 2-leg spider with span s = 2. We assume the first leg to be the left leg of\nthe spider. In this case L(x) = {(x, x + 1), (x, x + 2)}, see Figure 4.\n9\n\n\f(x, x + 1)\n\n(x, x + 2)\n\n(x + 3, x + 5)\n(x, x + 1)\n\nx\n\nx+1 x+2\n\nx\n\nx+1 x+2\n\nx\n\nx+1 x+2 x+3\n\nFigure 4: The two possible local configurations for a spider walk with bounded span (k = 2, s =\n2) at position x and a part of the spider graph.\n\nLet us identify (x, x + i) with 2x + i \u2212 1. Hence the spider graph can be seen as a stretched\nline, compare with Figure 4, and consequently the spider walk is itself a nearest neighbor random\nwalk on the line. We calculate its mean drift as\n\u03bcs (2x) =\n\n2x + 1\nq(x + 1, x + 2) \u2212 q(x, x \u2212 1)\n=\nq(x + 1, x + 2) + q(x, x \u2212 1)\n4x(x + 1) \u2212 1\n\nand\n\u03bcs (2x + 1) =\n\nq(x, x + 1) \u2212 q(x + 2, x + 1)\nx+1\n=\n.\nq(x, x + 1) + q(x + 2, x + 1)\n2x(x + 2) + 1\n\nEventually, we obtain \u03bcs (x) \u223c 1/x which implies transience of the spider.\nThe two following examples demonstrate that for reversible Markov chains that are not quasitransitive both can happen: positive recurrent Markov chain and null recurrent spider, and null\nrecurrent Markov chain and positive recurrent spider.\nExample 3.2. Positive recurrent Markov chain and null recurrent spider walk.\nLet GN , N \u2208 N, be the line segment [0, 1, . . . , N ]. The graph G is constructed in identifying the\n0's of the graphs GN . In order to distinguish the vertices of the different GN we denote xN for\nthe vertices of GN . On G we define the following Markov chain (Yn )n\u22650 :\n\u0012 \u0013N\n1\np(0, 1N ) =\n,\n2\n\np(NN , NN ) = 1 \u2212 p(NN , (N \u2212 1)N ) = p,\n\np(xN , (x + 1)N ) = 1 \u2212 p(xN , (x \u2212 1)N ) = p \u22001 \u2264 x < N,\nwhere p \u2208 (1/2, 1). Let T0 := min{n > 0 : Yn = 0} be the first return time to 0. It is\nstraightforward to show that\n\u0012 \u0013N\np\n,\nE[T0 | Y0 = 1N ] \u223c\nq\nwith q = 1 \u2212 p. Observe that the 2-leg spider with span s = 2 on GN behaves like a random\nwalk with drift on the line segment G2N , compare with Example 3.1. Let T0S be the first time\nthe spider visits (0, 11 ). Hence we obtain for the spider walk, denoted by Sn , that\n\u0012 \u00132N\np\nE[T0S | S0 = (0, 1N )] \u223c\n.\nq\n\u221a\nNow choosing p/q = 2 we obtain a positive recurrent Markov chain and a null recurrent spider.\n10\n\n\fExample 3.3. Null recurrent Markov chain and positive recurrent spider walk.\nWe consider the nearest neighbor Lamperti random walk with asymptotic zero drift, compare\nwith Example 3.1. Recall the corresponding criterion for ergodicity, Theorem 3.6.1(iii)-(iv) in [2]:\n1\nIf there exists a number B such that 0 \u2265 \u03bc(x) \u2265 \u2212 2x\nfor x \u2265 B then the Markov chain Yn is\n\u03b8\nnull recurrent. On the other hand if for some B and \u03b8 > 1 we have \u03bc(x) < \u2212 2x\nfor x \u2265 B,\nthen the Markov chain is positive recurrent. Eventually, the Lamperti random walk with mean\n1\ndrift \u03bc(x) = \u2212 2x\nis null recurrent but the corresponding 2-leg spider with span s = 2 is positive\nrecurrent.\n\n4\n\nSpeed\n\nThere is no analogue to Theorem 3.2 treating positive and zero speed. Already for transitive\nspiders it might be that the random walk has zero speed but the spider has positive speed and the\nrandom walk has positive speed but the spider walk has zero speed, compare with Example 4.1.\nFor the latter phenomenon we also refer to [3] for an example in random environment.\nExample 4.1. We consider the homogeneous tree T = TM with degree M and root o. A ray\nhx0 , x1 , . . . , i is an infinite path from o to infinity that does not backtrack, i.e., xi 6= xj for all\ni 6= j. Two rays are said to be equivalent if their symmetric difference has finitely many vertices.\nWe call the set of all equivalence classes of rays the (end) boundary of T, denoted by \u2202T. If\nx \u2208 T and \u03be \u2208 \u2202T then \u03be has a unique representative which is a ray starting at x, denoted by\nhx, \u03bei. The confluent x f y of two vertices x and y with respect to a ray \u03c9 is the first common\nvertex on the rays hx, \u03c9i and hy, \u03c9i. For any x \u2208 T we define its height with respect to \u03c9 by\nh(x) = d(x, x f o) \u2212 d(o, x f o),\nwhere d(*, *) is the natural graph distance. The k-th horocycle of T (with respect to \u03c9 and o) is\nthe set Hk = {x \u2208 T : h(x) = k}. For more details on this model we refer to Chapter 9 in [9]\nand to Figure 5. One can think of \u03c9 as the mythical ancestor of the genealogical tree T. Each\nx \u2208 Hk has exactly one neighbour (father) x\u2212 in Hk\u22121 and M \u2212 1 neighbours (sons), y \u2212 = x, in\nHk+1 .\nWe define a nearest neighbour random walk (Xn )n\u22650 on T:\np(x\u2212 , x) = a/(M \u2212 1),\n\np(x, x\u2212 ) = 1 \u2212 a,\n\nwhere 0 < a < 1. It turns out that the random walk is transient for all a \u2208 (0, 1) and\nlimn\u2192\u221e |Xn |/n = |2a \u2212 1| a.s. The speed of the jump chain (Sn )n\u22650 of the spider walk is\ncalculated using\nn\u22121\n1\n1X\nlim h(Sn ) = lim\n(H(Sk+1 ) \u2212 H(Sk )) .\n(2)\nn\u2192\u221e n\nn\u2192\u221e n\nk=0\n\n11\n\n\f\u03c9 \u0012\n\nH\u22121 p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n\nH0 p p p p p p p p p p p pop p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p\n@\n@\n@\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np p@\np p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p\nH1\n@\n@\n@\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np p@\np p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p\nH2\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n\nFigure 5: A part of the tree rooted at \u03c9 and horocycles corresponding to o.\nThe averages in (2) are over an ergodic stationary sequence since the factor chain is ergodic\nand hence the speed of the jump chain is\nX\nD=\n\u03a0(Oi )E[H(S1 ) \u2212 H(S0 ) | S0 \u2208 Oi ],\ni\n\nwhere \u03a0(*) denotes the stationary measure of the factor chain.\nIn order to obtain the speed in continuous time we have to divide D by the mean time it\ntakes until a leg jumps, i.e., by\nX\nT =\n\u03a0(Oi )E[inf {St 6= S0 } | \u03c4 (S0 ) = i].\ni\n\nt>0\n\nCalculating the speed of the 2-leg spider with M = 3 and a = 1/2 one observes: while for\ns = 1, 2 the speed of the spider equals zero the spider converges to \u03c9 with positive speed for s = 3.\nNow, consider To as the subtree of T rooted in o that consists of all vertices in x \u2208 Hk , k \u2265 0\nsuch that x lies on the geodesic ho, \u03c9i. In other words To is the genealogical tree of o. We obtain\nfor s = 3, M = 4, and a = 1/2 that the random walk is null-recurrent on To while the spider is\npositive recurrent.\nFurthermore, it is possible to choose a < 1/2 such that the spider has zero and the random\nwalk positive speed. In the same way, we can find some a such that the random walk converges\nto \u2202T \\ {\u03c9} with positive speed and the spider with positive speed to \u03c9. With this latter a the\nrandom walk on To is transient and the spider on To is positive recurrent.\n\n12\n\n\f4.1\n\nSpider walk on the line\n\nWe consider the 2-leg spider with span s on Z with rates q(x, x + 1) = p, q(x, x \u2212 1) = q,\nand 0 otherwise. The speed of the underlying Markov chain clearly is V = p \u2212 q. In order to\ncompute the speed of the spider we first calculate the stationary distribution \u03a0 of the factor\nchain, compare with the calculation in Example 4.1:\n\u03a0(1) =\n\n1\n1\n1\n, \u03a0(i) =\n, 1 < i < s, and \u03a0(s) =\n.\n2s \u2212 2\ns\u22121\n2s \u2212 2\n\nThis yields to\nD(s) =\n\ns\n1\n1p\u2212q\nand T (s) =\n.\n2p+q\n2(s \u2212 1) p + q\n\nEventually, we obtain the speed of the spider\nV (s) =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD(s)\n1\n= (p \u2212 q) 1 \u2212\n.\nT (s)\ns\n\nThis reproduces and generalizes results in [1], where the speed was calculated for p \u2208 {1/2, 1}.\nFurthermore, notice that V (s) < V for all s \u2265 2 and V (s) \u2192 V as s \u2192 \u221e.\n\n4.2\n\nSpiders walk on homogeneous trees\n\nIn this subsection we consider SRW on homogeneous trees and transitive spiders. As mentioned\nin the introduction the speed of the spider will be positive if the anchored isoperimetric constant\nof the spider is positive. Furthermore, the speed of the spider is strictly smaller than the speed\nof the random walk:\nTheorem 4.1. Let Q be a SRW on the homogeneous tree TM of degree, M \u2265 3, and speed V .\nThen any irreducible transitive spider (TM , Q, L) has positive speed strictly less than V .\nProof. The idea of the proof is to compare the spider graph GS with a larger graph H on which\nthe SRW has the same speed as the SRW on G = TM . Observe that in GS each vertex `i (x)\nhas at most one neighbour in the set {`j (y)}j\u2208L for all y 6= x. We add edges to GS such that for\nall x \u2208 G, i \u2208 L and all y \u223c x there exists exactly one j \u2208 L such that `i (x) \u223c `j (y). In other\nwords, in H every vertex `i (x) has exactly one neighbour in {`j (y)}j\u2208L for all y 6= x. Clearly,\nthe SRW (in continuous time) on H has the same speed as the SRW on G. It remains to show\nthat the addition of edges strictly increases the speed of the random walk. Let \u2202Bn be the set\nof vertices (of G) with distance n to o. Each vertex x \u2208 \u2202Bn has one neighbour in \u2202Bn\u22121 and\nM \u2212 1 neighbours in \u2202Bn+1 . Let us consider the set of local configurations {`i (x)}i\u2208L of the\nglobal position x \u2208 \u2202Bn . For each edge that is added to a local position in x\u2212 \u2208 \u2202Bn\u22121 we add\none corresponding edge to y where x \u223c y and y \u2208 \u2202Bn+1 . Eventually, for each edge leading back\nto the origin M \u2212 1 > 1 edges are added that lead away from the origin. The claim follows now\nby the observation that the stationary distribution of the factor chains (in continuous time) of\nthe local positions of GS and H is the uniform distribution. The fact that the speed is positive\nfollows from the discussion in the introduction.\n13\n\n\fLet us now consider the 2-leg spider with bounded span on the homogeneous tree of degree\nd \u2265 3. The calculation of the speed becomes more complicated compared to those for the spider\nwalk on Z, see Subsection 4.1. Observe that the number of local configurations is of order\ns2 and exact calculations of the stationary distribution of the factor chain become involved.\nNevertheless, we are able to prove the following asymptotic result that we conjecture to hold\ntrue for transitive spiders on homogeneous trees in general.\nTheorem 4.2. Let V (s) be the speed of a 2-leg spider with span s on a homogeneous tree TM of\ndegree M \u2265 3. Then, V (s) \u2192 0, if s \u2192 \u221e.\nProof. For sake of simplicity we give the proof only for M = 3. We encode the local configuration\nof the spider as the tuple (l, k), (1 \u2264 l, k \u2264 s), where l = d(x1 , x2 ) is the distance and k =\n|d(x1 , o) \u2212 d(x2 , o)| is the height difference between the two legs x1 and x2 . This factor chain has\nthe following transition rates q, compare with Figure 6.\n\u2022 l, k = 1: q((1, 1), (2, 2)) = 3 and q((1, 1), (2, 0)) = 1\n\u2022 1 < l = k < s: q((l, l), (l+1, l+1)) = 3, q((l, l), (l+1, l\u22121)) = 1 and q((l, l), (l\u22121, l\u22121)) = 2\n\u2022 l, k = s: q((s, s), (s \u2212 1, s \u2212 1)) = 2\n\u2022 0 < l < s, k = 0: q((l, 0), (l \u2212 1, 1)) = 2 and q((l, 0), (l + 1, 1)) = 4\n\u2022 l = 0, k = s: q((0, s), (1, s \u2212 1)) = 2\n\u2022 0 < l < s, 0 < k < s: q((l, k), (l + 1, k \u2212 1)) = 1, q((l, k), (l + 1, k + 1)) = 1, q((l, k), (l +\n1, k \u2212 1)) = 2 and q((l, k), (l \u2212 1, k + 1)) = 2\n\u2022 l = s, 0 < k < s: q((l, k), (l \u2212 1, k \u2212 1)) = 1 and q((l, k), (l \u2212 1, k + 1)) = 1\n\u2022 and 0 otherwise.\nThe position of the spider will be defined as follows. Assume the two legs be in positions x1\nand x2 with d(x1 , x2 ) = l. Let hx1 = y1 , y2 , . . . , yl = x2 i be the geodesic between x1 and x2 . If\nl is even the position of the spider is defined as yl/2 and if l is odd as the middle of the edge\n(y(l\u22121)/2 , y(l+1)/2 ). Therefore, the distance to the root is d(yl/2 , o) resp. d(y(l\u22121)/2 , o) + 1/2. In\norder to estimate the speed observe that only local configurations of the type (l, 0), 1 \u2264 l \u2264 s have\na positive drift, i.e., E[H(S1 ) \u2212 H(S0 )|\u03c4 (S0 ) = Oi ] > 0 only if Oi corresponds to (l, 0), 1 \u2264 l \u2264 s,\ncompare with Example 4.1. Let \u03a0 the stationary distribution of the factor chain (Yn )n\u22650 . In\norder to prove that V (s) \u2192 0 as s \u2192 \u221e it remains to show that \u03a0({(l, 0), 1 \u2264 l \u2264 s}) \u2192 0 as\ns \u2192 \u221e. Let \u03c4B := min{n \u2265 1 : Yn \u2208 B} be the first hitting time of B and mx,B = Ex \u03c4B . There\nis the following relation\nX\n\u03a0(i)mi,B = 1,\ni\u2208B\n\nsee Proposition 6.24 of [5]. Let B = {(l, 0), 1 \u2264 l \u2264 s} and observe that the projection of (Yn )n\u22650\non the second coordinate k behaves like a reflected simple random walk and hence mx,B \u2265 cs for\nall s and some constant c > 0. Eventually, \u03a0(B) \u2192 0 as s \u2192 \u221e and the claim follows.\n\n14\n\n\fl\n6\nr\n\n2\nr\n\n3\u0012\n2\nr\nr\nr\n\n3\u0012\n\nr\n\nr\n@1\n@\nRr\n@\n\nr\nr\n\nr\nr\n\n1\nr\n\nr\nI2\n@\n@\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\nI1\n@\n@\n@r\n\nr\n\nr\n@1\n@\nRr\n@\nr\nI1\n@\n@\n\nr\n\nr\n\n2\u0012\n\nr\n\n@r\n@2\n@\nRr\n@\n\n4\u0012\n\nr\n\n@r\n\nr\n\n(1, 0)\n\n1\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\nI2\n@\n@\n@\n\n-\n\nk\n\nFigure 6: Local configurations and some transition rates for s = 10.\n\nSome open questions\nQuestion 4.1. Consider a transient SRW on a graph G with positive speed V and denote V (s)\nthe speed of a k-leg spider with span s. Is it true that V (s) \u2192 c < V as s \u2192 \u221e?

If the SRW on a Cayley graph G has positive speed V , then any transitive\nspider has positive speed smaller than V .\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe warmly thank the anonymous referee for his careful reading and numerous suggestions.
