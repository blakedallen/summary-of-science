We assume that the \u031f\u03c6-component of the Maxwell stress is proportional to the total\npressure, and prescribe the radial dependence of the magnetic flux advection rate in order to complete the\nset of basic equations.

The accretion flow is composed of the outer ADAF, a luminous hot\naccretion flow (LHAF) inside the transition layer from the outer ADAF to the low-\u03b2 disk, the low-\u03b2 disk,\nand the inner ADAF.

It is known that galactic BHCs show X-ray\nspectral state transitions in their transient outbursts. The\nsystem typically undergoes a transition from the low/hard\nstate to the high/soft state (so-called hard-to-soft transition). In the low/hard state, the X-ray spectrum is approximated by a hard power law (photon index \u223c 1.7) with\nan exponential cutoff (Ecut \u223c 200 keV), and the luminosity is low. In the high/soft state, the X-ray spectrum is\ndominated by a blackbody component emitted from the\nstandard accretion disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), and\nthe luminosity is high.\nX-ray observations of BHCs have identified two\ntypes of hard-to-soft transition (e.g., Belloni et al.\n2006; Gierli\u0144ski & Newton 2006). One is the bright\nhard-to-soft transition whose transition luminosity is\nhigh (\u223c 0.3LEdd), where LEdd = 4\u03c0cGM/\u03baes \u223c 1.47 \u00d7\n\u0001\u22121\n1039 (M/10M\u2299 ) \u03baes /0.34 cm2 g\u22121\nerg s\u22121 is the\nEddington luminosity, M is the black hole mass, and \u03baes\nis the electron scattering opacity. The other is the dark\nhard-to-soft transition whose transition luminosity is low\n\n(< 0.1LEdd).\nIn the bright hard-to-soft transition, several additional\nX-ray spectral states are identified during the transition from the initial low/hard state to the high/soft\nstate: bright/hard state (or simply, the brightening of\nthe hard state), intermediate state, and very high/steep\npower-law state (e.g., Homan & Belloni 2005; Miyakawa\net al. 2008). The X-ray spectrum in the bright/hard\nstate is approximated by a hard power law as in the\nlow/hard state. However, the energy cutoff decreases\nfrom \u223c 200 keV to \u223c 50 keV as the luminosity increases\n(in other word, strongly anti-correlates with the luminosity) in the bright/hard state while it is roughly constant (or very weakly anti-correlates with the luminosity)\naround 200 keV in the low/hard state (e.g. Joinet et al.\n2008; Miyakawa et al. 2008; Motta et al. 2009). In general, the energy cutoff is related to the temperature of\nthe thermal Comptonizing electrons in an optically thin\ndisk (or corona) close to the black hole. Spectral analyses with thermal Comptonization models (e.g. COMPST\nmodel in XSPEC introduced by Sunyaev & Titarchuk\n1980, COMPTT model by Titarchuk 1994, and COMPPS\nmodel by Poutanen & Svensson 1996) also show the anticorrelation between the electron temperature and the luminosity (e.g. Joinet et al. 2008; Miyakawa et al. 2008).\n\n\f2\n\nH. Oda et al.\n\nIn order to account for this anti-correlation, Miyakawa\net al. (2008) proposed a possible scenario that the heating\nbalances the radiative cooling due to the inverse Compton\nscattering; that is, the accretion flow is radiatively efficient\nin the bright/hard state.\nIn addition to the appearance of these additional states,\nrecent analyses on the X-ray and radio data of BHCs (e.g.,\nFender et al. 2009) suggest that episodic ejections of relativistic jets are associated with the bright hard-to-soft\ntransition. The episodic ejections are observed at near\nthe peak luminosity of each outburst during the transition from the bright/hard state to the very high/steep\npower-law state. (Note that they are not observed in the\nbright/hard state). Therefore, understanding the physical\nmechanism in the bright/hard state may play an important role in understanding the mechanism of the disk-jet\ncoupling in BHCs. In this paper, we focus on the physical\nstate of the accretion disk in the bright/hard state.\nThe standard disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) has\nbeen widely and successfully used to account for the blackbody component. However, optically thin, hot accretion\ndisks have been studied to account for hard X-rays from\nBHCs (Thorne & Price 1975; Shibazaki & H\u014dshi 1975).\nEardley et al. (1975) and Shapiro et al. (1976) constructed\na model for an optically thin, two-temperature accretion\ndisk in which ions are much hotter than electrons and\nthe viscous heating balances the radiative cooling. This\nmodel, however, is thermally unstable.\nAdvection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) or radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) were introduced by Ichimaru (1977) and have been studied extensively by Narayan and Yi (1994, 1995) and Abramowicz\net al. (1995). Esin et al. (1997, 1998) found that the maximum luminosity for the ADAF/RIAF is L \u223c 0.4\u03b12 LEdd,\nwhere \u03b1 is the viscous parameter (Shakura & Sunyaev\n1973), and showed that the electron temperature is Te >\n\u223c\n109.5 K. Therefore, the ADAF/RIAF model can account\nfor the high-energy cutoff and the low luminosity in the\nlow/hard state. However, this model cannot account for\nthe relatively low-energy cutoff (Ecut <\n\u223c 200 keV, hence\nthe relatively low electron temperature) and the high luminosity (L >\n\u223c 0.1LEdd) observed in the bright/hard state.\nLuminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) were proposed\nby Yuan (2001, 2003), in which heat advection works as an\neffective heating and balances the radiative cooling above\nthe maximum mass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF.\nAlthough this model is thermally unstable, Yuan et al.\n(2003) concluded that the thermal instability will have no\neffect on the dynamics of the LHAF because the accretion\ntimescale is shorter than the growth timescale of the local\nthermal perturbation at high mass accretion rates. The\nLHAF model can partly account for the bright/hard state\nobserved in the range of a relatively low luminosity and\na relatively high energy cutoff (e.g., Yuan & Zdziarski\n2004; Yuan et al. 2007). However, this model also cannot\naccount for the bright/hard state observed in the range of\na higher luminosity and the lower energy cutoff because\nthe electron temperature is a little too high (Te \u223c 109 K).\nIn addition, the anti-correlation between the luminosity\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nand the electron temperature is weak.\nIn these models, magnetic fields are not considered explicitly, and the plasma \u03b2 (\u2261 pgas /pmag ) is given as a constant parameter in general (typically, \u03b2 >\n\u223c 1). A robust\nmechanism of excitation of magnetic turbulence in accretion disks is thought to be the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), since Balbus and Hawley (1991) pointed out\nits importance. Many local and global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have investigated the growth\nand the saturation level of the MRI in accretion disks.\nThese simulations revealed that the MRI can excite and\nmaintain magnetic turbulence and that the Maxwell stress\ngenerated by the MRI can efficiently transport the angular momentum of the disk gas. In addition, several MHD\nsimulations and analytical studies suggest that magnetic\nturbulence driven by the MRI can survive even when the\nmagnetic pressure is dominant; therefore, highly magnetized accretion disks are astrophysically viable (e.g.,\nShibata et al. 1990; Pessah & Psaltis 2005; Machida et\nal. 2006; Johansen & Levin 2008).\nMachida et al. (2006) demonstrated transitions from\nan ADAF/RIAF-like disk (optically thin, geometrically\nthick, radiatively inefficient, hot, gas pressure dominant\ndisk; \u03b2 \u223c 5) to a low-\u03b2 disk (optically thin, geometrically moderately thick, radiatively efficient, cool, magnetic pressure dominant disk; \u03b2 \u223c 0.1) by global threedimensional MHD simulations incorporating the radiative\ncooling (see figure 1). When the mass-accretion rate exceeds the threshold for the onset of a cooling instability,\nthe initial ADAF/RIAF-like disk rapidly shrinks in the\nvertical direction due to the cooling instability. During\nthe transition, azimuthal magnetic fluxes inside the disk\nare almost conserved because the timescale of the cooling instability is shorter than that of the buoyant escape\nof magnetic fluxes from the disk surface. In this way,\nthe magnetic pressure becomes dominant and supports\nthe disk. Johansen and Levin (2008) performed vertically stratified shearing box simulations of a local patch of\nsuch highly magnetized disks. They showed that the MRI\nstill survives even in such magnetic pressure dominant\ndisks; thus, magnetic fields are still turbulent. Although\nthe strong magnetic field reduces the growth rate of the\nParker instability (Parker 1966) and the MRI, the generation of azimuthal magnetic fluxes around the equatorial\nplane still balances the buoyant escape of magnetic fluxes\nfrom the disk surface. Hence the system can stay in a\nquasi-steady state. We note that such low-\u03b2 disks are essentially different from magnetically-dominated accretion\nflows (MDAFs; Meier 2005) which appear in the innermost plunging region of optically thin disks (see also figure 1. We will discuss this issue in the discussion section).\nWe focus on the low-\u03b2 disk in this paper.\nMineshige et al. (1995) suggested that an optically\nthin, magnetic pressure dominated disk emits hard Xrays. Pariev et al. (2003) developed a local analytical\nmodel of an optically thick, geometrically thin, strongly\nmagnetized disk which produces spectra quite similar to\nthose of the standard disk model. The property of such\nmagnetically dominated disks was extensively examined\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nMagnetically Supported Accretion Disk\n\nby Begelman and Pringle (2007). Bu et al. (2009) presented self-similar solutions of magnetized ADAF/RIAF.\nOda et al. (2007) constructed an one-temperature\nplasma model of an optically thin accretion disk incorporating magnetic fields on the basis of the results of\nthree-dimensional MHD simulations. They assumed that\nthe \u031f\u03c6-component of the stress tensor is proportional\nto the total pressure, and prescribed the advection rate\nof azimuthal magnetic fluxes in order to complete the\nset of basic equations of the vertically integrated, onedimensional accretion flow in steady state. Oda et al.\n(2009) extended the model to an optically thick disk model\nand Oda et al. (2010) extended it to a two-temperature\nplasma model. They obtained local thermal equilibrium\nsolutions, and found a new, thermally stable, low-\u03b2 disk\nsolution in the optically thin and thick regime. The local\nthermal equilibrium solution of the optically thin low-\u03b2\ndisk exists above the maximum mass accretion rate for\nthe ADAF/RIAF, and the electron temperature is lower\nthan that in the ADAF/RIAF. They concluded that the\noptically thin, low-\u03b2 disk can account for the bright/hard\nstate during the bright hard-to-soft transition of BHCs.\nHowever, the results reported by Oda et al. (2009, 2010)\nwere based on the local models in the sense that the interactions between adjacent annuli of the disk were neglected\n(or, put mathematically, the derivative terms in the basic\nequations were parametrized). Therefore, they could not\ninvestigate global structures, in particular, composed of\ndifferent types of flows. In addition, accretion flows are\ngenerally thought to be transonic around the black hole.\nHowever, the local solution can deviate from the transonic\nsolution, in particular, in the inner region where most of\nthe X-ray is emitted.\nIn this paper, we consider global structures of optically\nthin, two-temperature, black hole accretion disks incorporating magnetic fields. The main purpose is to account\nfor the bright/hard state during the bright hard-to-soft\ntransition. In particular, we focus on the transition from\nthe low/hard state to the bright/hard state which can be\nexplained by the transition from the ADAF/RIAF to the\nlow-\u03b2 disk. The basic equations are described in section\n2. In section 3 and section 4, we present results of the\nglobal solutions. Section 5 is devoted to discussion. We\nsummarize the paper in section 6.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nModel and Assumptions\nBasic Equations\n\nIn this section, we derive the basic equations for vertically integrated, one-dimensional steady-state, optically\nthin, two-temperature black hole accretion flows (e.g.,\nKato et al. 2008) incorporating magnetic fields (see also\nOda et al. 2010) from the resistive MHD equations. We\nadopt cylindrical coordinates (\u031f, \u03c6, z). General relativistic effects are simulated using the pseudo-Newtonian potential \u03c8 = \u2212GM/(r \u2212 rs ) (Paczy\u0144sky & Wiita 1980),\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the black\nhole mass (we assume M = 10M\u2299 in this paper), r =\n(\u031f2 +z 2 )1/2 , and rs = 2GM/c2 \u223c 2.95\u00d7106 (M/10M\u2299) cm\n\n3\n\nis the Schwarzschild radius. For simplicity, the gas is assumed to consist of protons (ions) and electrons.

Azimuthally Averaged Equations\nThree-dimensional global and local MHD simulations\nof black hole accretion disks showed that magnetic fields\ninside the disk are turbulent and dominated by the azimuthal component both in the ADAF/RIAF-like state\nand in the low-\u03b2 disk state (e.g., Machida et al. 2006;\nJohansen & Levin 2008). On the basis of results of\nthe simulations, we decompose\u0001 the magnetic fields into\nthe mean fields, B\u0304 = 0, B \u0304\u03c6 , 0 , and fluctuating fields,\n\u03b4B = (\u03b4B\u031f , \u03b4B\u03c6 , \u03b4Bz ), and also decomposed the velocity\ninto the mean velocity, v\u0304 = (v\u031f ,v\u03c6 ,vz ), and the fluctuating\nvelocity, \u03b4v = (\u03b4v\u031f , \u03b4v\u03c6 , \u03b4vz ). We assume that the fluctuating components vanish when azimuthally averaged,\nh\u03b4vi = h\u03b4Bi = 0, and that the radial and vertical components of the magnetic fields are negligible compared with\nthe azimuthal component, |B \u0304\u03c6 + \u03b4B\u03c6 | \u226b |\u03b4B\u031f |, |\u03b4Bz | (see\nthe left panel in figure 2).

In this way, we prescribe the magnetic flux advection rate at a radius by setting \u03a6\u0307out and\n\u03b6. To avoid numerical difficulties concerning the choice of\nlin , we set lout \u2212lin = 0.5lK0 , Tout = 0.375Tvir, and \u03b2out = 3\nso that \u03a6\u0307out has the unique value for given \u03b1 and \u1e40 .\nEquation (31) is the second key assumption in this paper. Prescribing the magnetic flux advection rate enables\nthe magnetic pressure to increase when the disk temperature decreases. In contrast, if we prescribe the plasma\n\u03b2 at each radius instead of the magnetic flux advection\nrate, a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in\nmagnetic pressure. This is inconsistent with the results of\nthree-dimensional MHD simulations (e.g., Machida et al.\n2006).\n2.4.\n\nEnergy Equations\n\nIn the conventional theory, the viscous heating was ex+\npressed as qvis\n= t\u031f\u03c6 \u031f (d\u03a9/d\u031f), where t\u031f\u03c6 is the \u031f\u03c6component of the total stress. Three-dimensional MHD\nsimulations of accretion disks indicated that the dissipation of turbulent magnetic field energy dominates the total dissipative heating rate throughout the disk, and is\nexpressed as q + \u223c hB\u031f B\u03c6 /4\u03c0i\u031f (d\u03a9/d\u031f) (e.g., Hirose et\nal. 2006; Machida et al. 2006; Krolik et al. 2007: Hereafter,\nwe refer to it as the magnetic heating rate). We employ magnetic heating as the heating mechanism inside\nthe disk. Following these simulation results and using the\n\u03b1-prescription of the Maxwell stress tensor, equation (25),\nwe set the vertically integrated heating rate as follows:\nQ+ =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2202 ln \u03a9\nhB\u031f B\u03c6 i \u2202 ln \u03a9\ndz = \u2212\u03b1Wtot \u03a9\n\u03a9\n.\n4\u03c0\n\u2202 ln \u031f\n\u2202 ln \u031f\n(32)\n\nWe assume that the energy transfer from ions to electrons occurs via Coulomb collisions and use the energy\ntransfer rate Qie given by Stepney and Guilbert (1983)\nand Dermer et al. (1991). We consider bremsstrahlung\n(Svensson 1982; Stepney & Guilbert 1983; Narayan &\nYi 1995), synchrotron (Pacholczyk 1970; Mahadevan\net al. 1996; Esin et al. 1996), and Compton cooling by\nbremsstrahlung and synchrotron photons (Dermer et al.\n1991; Narayan & Yi 1995) as cooling processes [see Oda et\nal. (2010) for details]. The vertically integrated radiative\ncooling rate is expressed as\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nin the case of a non-relativistic electrons to 3 in the case of\na relativistic electrons (e.g., Chandrasekhar 1939; Esin et\nal. 1997). We assumed that ai = 3/2 in the case of a nonrelativistic ions because the thermal energy of ions never\nexceeds 10% of the ion rest mass energy in our solutions.\n2.5.\n\nOuter Boundary Condition\n\nWe imposed the outer boundary condition at \u031fout =\n1000rs ,\nlout \u2212 lin = 0.5lK0 (\u031f = \u031fout ) ,\n\n(36)\n\n\u2202fad,e\n\u2202\u031f\n\n=0 ,\n\n(37)\n\n\u031f=\u031fout\n\nand\n\u2202fad,i\n\u2202\u031f\n\n=0 ,\n\n(38)\n\n\u031f=\u031fout\n\nwhere fad,e and fad,i are the fraction of the heat advection\nto the heating for electrons and ions (so-called advection\nfactors) defined as\nfad,e \u2261\n\nQad,e\n,\n\u03b4heat Q+ + Qie\n\n(39)\n\nfad,i \u2261\n\nQad,i\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4heat )Q+\n\n(40)\n\nrespectively. Again, to avoid numerical difficulties concerning a choice of lin , we fixed lin = lK0 (\u031f = 3rs ) when we\ncompute the outer boundary condition so that the outer\nboundary condition is unique for given \u03b1 and \u1e40 .\nUnder the boundary condition, we obtain an\nADAF/RIAF-type solution near the outer boundary for\na low-mass accretion rate and a low-\u03b2 disk-type boundary solution for a high-mass accretion rate. In the middle range of the mass-accretion rates, we obtain several\ntypes of boundary solutions, specifically, an ADAF/RIAFtype, SLE-type, LHAF-type, low-\u03b2 disk-type, and/or\nintermediate-type solutions. In this case, we choose the\nboundary solution having the highest value of the advection factor for ions, that is, the boundary solution closest\nto the ADAF/RIAF-type one.\n3.\n\nGlobal Solutions\n\nWe obtained global solutions of optically thin, twotemperature\nblack hole accretion disks by numerically in=\n.\n(33)\ntegrating the basic equations from the outer boundary.\nOn the left-hand side of the energy equations,\nThe free parameters were \u1e40 , \u03b1, \u03b4heat , and \u03b6.\n\u0014\n\u0015\nWe chose \u03b1 = 0.05 as an example of a pressure-gradient1\n1 3K3 (1/\u03b8e ) + K1 (1/\u03b8e )\nae (Te ) =\n=\n\u2212 1 , driven flow and \u03b1 = 0.2 as an example of a viscosity-driven\n\u03b3e (Te ) \u2212 1 \u03b8e\nK4 (1/\u03b8e )\nflow around the radius of the critical point (Matsumoto\n(34)\net al. 1984; Narayan et al. 1997; Nakamura et al. 1997).\nAlso, the former corresponds to the case of a low transi1\n3\nai =\n= ,\n(35) tion luminosity from the ADAF/RIAF to the low-\u03b2 disk,\n(\u03b3i \u2212 1) 2\nand the latter corresponds to the case of a high transiwhere Kn are modified Bessel function of the second kind tion luminosity, because the maximum luminosity for the\nof the order n, \u03b8e \u2261 kTe /(me c2 ) is the dimensionless elec- ADAF/RIAF is L \u223c 0.4\u03b12 LEdd .\ntron temperature.

When \u03b6 has a small value\n(e.g., \u03b6 = 0), we cannot obtain low-\u03b2 disk solutions but\nusual ADAF/RIAF and LHAF solutions. In this case, the\nmagnetic pressure becomes negligible compared to the gas\npressure in the inner region. Hence, the equations reduce\nto that of the conventional model. On the other hand,\nwhen \u03b6 is too large (e.g., \u03b6 > 1), the magnetic pressure\nalways becomes dominant in the inner region, even at low\nmass-accretion rates.\nThe fraction of the magnetic heating \u03b4heat is a poorly\nconstrained parameter. Yuan et al. (2003) suggested that\n\u03b4heat \u223c 0.5 be required to fit the spectrum of Sgr A\u2217 with\nthe ADAF/RIAF model. Sharma et al. (2007) performed\nlocal sharing box simulations of the nonlinear evolution\nof the MRI in a collisionless plasma incorporating the\npressure anisotropy, and showed that \u03b4heat is a function\ni\u22121\nh\np\n).\nof Te and Ti (approximately, \u03b4heat = 1 + 3 Ti /Te\nHowever, we found no qualitative difference for any value\nof \u03b4heat in the low-\u03b2 disk solutions (see also Oda et al.\n2010). Even in the ADAF/RIAF solutions, we found\nsmall differences only in the electron temperature and advection factors in the inner region. Therefore, we choose\n\u03b4heat = 0.2 as the fiducial value in this paper.\n3.1.\n\nRadial Structure and Energy Balance of Global\nSolutions\n\nFirst, we show the results for the case \u03b1 = 0.05, \u03b6 = 0.9,\nand \u03b4heat = 0.2. Figure 3 shows the radial distribution of\nthe electron temperature, Te , the ion temperature, Ti , the\nplasma \u03b2, the magnetic field strength at the equatorial\nplane, B0 , the radial velocity, v\u031f , the surface density, \u03a3,\nthe ratio of specific angular momentum to Keplerian angular momentum, l/lK0 , and the ratio of half thickness\nof the disk to radius, H/\u031f. We denote the radius of the\ncritical point at which D = N1 = N2 = N3 = 0 by the plus\nsign (+). The energy balance is illustrated in figure 4.\nThe top and second panels show the radial distribution of\nthe advection factors for ions fad,i , and for electrons, fad,e ,\nrespectively. In addition, we introduce the total advection\nfactor,\nfad \u2261\n\nQad,e + Qad,i\n,\nQ+\n\n(41)\n\nin order to classify solutions; this is illustrated in the third\npanel. The bottom panel shows the radial distribution of\nthe fraction of the magnetic heating rate to the total heating rate for electrons, \u03b4heat Q+ /(\u03b4heat Q+ +Qie ), in order to\nillustrate which process mainly heats electrons, the magnetic heating or the energy transfer from ions. The disk\nparameters are summarized in table 1.\nWe describe five representative solutions with different\nmass-accretion rates. For an ADAF/RIAF solution (fad >\n\u223c\n0.5 in the entire region) when the mass accretion rate is\nlow, \u1e40 /\u1e40Edd = 1.089 \u00d7 10\u22123 (gray dashed). For a critical ADAF/RIAF solution (the minimum value of fad \u223c 0)\nwhen the mass accretion rate is close to the maximum\n\n7\n\nmass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF, \u1e40 /\u1e40Edd =\n8.043 \u00d7 10\u22123 (gray thin solid). For a LHAF solution (the\nsolution having the lowest negative value of fad , that is,\nthe heat advection works as an effective heating most efficiently) when the mass accretion rate slightly exceeding\nthe maximum mass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF,\n\u1e40 /\u1e40Edd = 1.224 \u00d7 10\u22122 (long dashed). For a low-\u03b2 disk\nsolution (the minimum value of \u03b2 \u223c 0.1) when the mass\naccretion rate is relatively high, \u1e40 /\u1e40Edd = 2.246 \u00d7 10\u22122\n(short dashed). For an extremely low-\u03b2 disk solution (the\nminimum value of \u03b2 \u223c 0.01) when the mass accretion rate\nis high, \u1e40 /\u1e40Edd = 5.984 \u00d7 10\u22122 (solid).\nIn the ADAF/RIAF solution, ions are heated by magnetic heating and a substantial fraction of the dissipated\nenergy is advected inward. In the outer region, electrons are mainly heated by energy transfer from ions,\nand heat advection for electrons works as effective cooing. Meanwhile, electrons in the inner region are mainly\nheated by magnetic heating, and heat advection for electrons works as effective heating. A substantial fraction\nof the dissipated energy that heats electrons is radiated\naway.\nIn the critical ADAF/RIAF solution, the heat advection\nbecomes inefficient around 60rs where the energy transfer\nfrom ions to electrons via Coulomb collisions becomes efficient because the surface density increases. As a result,\nthe ion temperature slightly decreases, and electrons receive almost all of the dissipated energy, which is radiated\naway around this radius.\nIn the LHAF solution, the radiative cooling becomes\n<\nefficient in the middle region (20rs <\n\u223c \u031f \u223c 100rs ) because\nthe surface density increases further. Therefore, the electron temperature decreases (but slightly). The ion temperature also decreases because ions are well coupled to\nelectrons due to the efficient energy transfer via Coulomb\ncollisions. Thus, the heat advection for both electrons and\nions works as an effective heating in this transition layer\nfrom the high entropy region to the low entropy region.\nSuch heat advection balances the radiative cooling.\nIn the low-\u03b2 disk solution, the radiative cooling and the\nenergy transfer from ions to electrons via Coulomb collisions become more efficient and overwhelm the heat advection except in the innermost plunging region (\u031f <\n\u223c 4rs ).\nThe gas pressure decreases due to radiative cooling, while\nthe magnetic pressure increases due to conservation of the\nmagnetic flux advection rate at each radius. As a result,\nthe total pressure still remains large. Therefore, the magnetic heating being proportional to the total pressure can\nbe large enough to balance the radiative cooling.\nIn the extremely low-\u03b2 disk solution, the structure of\nthe disk is qualitatively the same as the low-\u03b2 disk solution\nbut the temperature is lower and the magnetic pressure\nbecomes more dominant.\nWe also show the results for the case \u03b1 = 0.2, \u03b6 = 0.9,\nand \u03b4heat = 0.2 in figure 5 and figure 6. We obtained\nsolutions at mass accretion rates higher than the results\nfor the case \u03b1 = 0.05 basically because the heating rate\nbeing proportional to \u03b1 increases.\n\n\f8\n3.2.\n\nH. Oda et al.\nForce Balance in the Radial Direction\n\nWe describe force balance in the radial direction. The\nnon-dimensional pressure gradient force, the effective centrifugal force, and the magnetic tension force are given by\nWtot 1 \u2202 ln Wtot \u0010 rs \u0011\nfp = \u2212\n,\n(42)\n\u03a3 \u031f \u2202 ln \u031f\nc2\n\u0015\nl2 \u2212 lK0 2 Wtot 1 d ln \u03a9K0 \u0010 rs \u0011\n\u2212\nfc =\n\u031f3\n\u03a3 \u031f d ln \u031f\nc2\ni\nh\n\u0001\n2 d ln \u03a9K0\n\u0010r \u0011\nl2 \u2212 lK0 2 1 + H\n\u031f\nd ln \u031f\ns\n,\n=\n\u031f3\nc2\nand,\nWtot 1 2\u03b2 \u22121 \u0010 rs \u0011\nfm = \u2212\n,\n\u03a3 \u031f 1 + \u03b2 \u22121 c2\n\u0014\n\n(43)\n\n(44)\n\nwhich are derived from the second term on the left-hand\nside, the first and second terms, and the last term on the\nright-hand side of equation (19), respectively. We note\nthat even in the case that l = lK0 , the centrifugal force\nhas a non-zero (but trivial) value unless H/\u031f \u226a 1 due to\nthe presence of the correction factor for the gravitational\nforce.\nFigure 7 illustrates the radial distribution of the pressure gradient force (solid), the effective centrifugal force\n(dashed), and the magnetic tension force (dotted) in\nthe inner region of the disks (1.6rs < \u031f < 10rs ) for five\nrepresentative solutions (the ADAF/RIAF, the critical\nADAF/RIAF, the LHAF, the low-\u03b2 disk, the extremely\nlow-\u03b2 disk from top to bottom) for the case \u03b1 = 0.05,\n\u03b6 = 0.90, and \u03b4heat = 0.2. Just outside the radius of the\ncritical point, the primary inward force is the effective\ncentrifugal force when the mass accretion rate is low. As\nthe mass accretion rate increases, the pressure gradient\nforce becomes dominant, that is, the flow is pressuregradient-driven. The nature of flows very near the radius\nof the critical point is the same as the conventional model\n(Nakamura et al. 1997; Narayan et al. 1997). However,\nthis is not the case outside this region when the mass\naccretion rate is high; the magnetic tension force is the\nprimary inward force. In other word, the pressure gradient force pushes the gas inward very near the radius of\ncritical point, while the magnetic tension force pushes the\ndisk gas inward outside this region.\nFigure 8 illustrates the force balance for the case \u03b1 =\n0.20, \u03b6 = 0.90, and \u03b4heat = 0.2. In contrast to the results for the case \u03b1 = 0.05, the primary inward force is always the effective centrifugal force just outside the radius\nof the critical point; that is, the flow is viscosity-driven.\nHowever, as well as the results for the case \u03b1 = 0.05, the\nmagnetic tension force is the primary inward force outside\nthis region when the mass accretion rate is high.\n3.3.\n\nDependence on \u03b6\n\nWe investigated the dependence on the parameter \u03b6 prescribing the radial dependence of the magnetic flux advection rate. We illustrate the radial distribution of the\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nplasma \u03b2 and the magnetic field strength at the equatorial\nplane, B0 , in figure 9, and the electron temperature and\nthe ion temperature in figure 10. The disk parameters are\n\u03b1 = 0.05, \u03b4heat = 0.2, \u03b6 = 0.5 (dashed), 0.75 (long dashed),\n0.9 (solid), and 1 (dotted). The three representative solutions (ADAF/RIAF, LHAF, low-\u03b2 disk solutions) are\nillustrated from the top panel to the bottom panel.\nAt low mass-accretion rates (i.e., the ADAF/RIAF solutions), the plasma \u03b2 increases for \u03b6 < 0.9 and decreases\nfor \u03b6 > 0.9 with decreasing radius, while being roughly\nuniform at \u223c 5 for \u03b6 = 0.9. For this reason, we choose\n\u03b6 = 0.9 as the fiducial value in this paper.\nIn the ADAF/RIAF solution, the magnetic heating being proportional to the total pressure is insensitive to the\nmagnetic pressure because the gas pressure dominates the\ntotal pressure. In addition, the radiative cooling that is\ncontributed by the magnetic field via the synchrotron and\nsynchrotron-Compton cooling are inefficient. Therefore,\nthe electron and ion temperatures are roughly independent of \u03b6, while the plasma \u03b2 and B0 strongly depend on\n\u03b6.\nAs the mass accretion rate increases and exceeds the\nmaximum mass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF (i.e.,\nin the LHAF solutions), the radiative cooling becomes\n<\nefficient in the middle region (20rs <\n\u223c \u031f \u223c 100rs ). For a\nlower magnetic flux advection rate (i.e., a smaller value of\n\u03b6), a larger decrease in gas pressure is required in order for\nthe magnetic pressure to become high enough to support\nthe disk. Therefore, the electron temperature and the ion\ntemperature decrease more drastically in the transition\nlayer (\u031f \u223c 25rs ).\nAs the mass-accretion rate increases further, the transition layer retreats outward and the disk becomes cooler\nand more magnetic pressure dominant. We note that a\nlower magnetic flux advection rate (i.e., a smaller value\nof \u03b6) results in lower temperatures and lower plasma \u03b2 in\nthe inner region. In contrast, the magnetic field strength\nattains roughly the same level for different values of \u03b6.\n4.\n\nRelations between\nQuantities\n\n\u1e40 ,\n\nL\n\nversus\n\nLocal\n\nThe relations between the mass-accretion rate (or the\nluminosity) and the physical quantities, such as the surface density, electron temperature at a radius, are widely\nused to understand the X-ray spectral state transition observed in BHCs. In this section, we consider these relations obtained from the global solutions.\nFigure 11 shows the relations between \u03a3 versus \u1e40 , Te ,\nTi , and \u03b2 at \u031f = 5rs for the case \u03b1 = 0.05, \u03b4heat = 0.2,\n\u03b6 = 0.90 (black), 0.75 (gray), and 0.50 (open diamond).\nWe obtained ADAF/RIAF branches in the low massaccretion rate and high-temperature region, and low-\u03b2\ndisk branches in the high mass-accretion rate and lowtemperature region.\nNot the mass-accretion rate, but the luminosity is an\nobservable quantity. The electron temperature and the\nCompton y parameter are fundamental parameters of\nX-ray spectral fitting with the thermal Comptonization\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nMagnetically Supported Accretion Disk\n\nmodel. To make it easier to compare our results with\nobservations, we also show the relation between Te and\nthe Compton y parameter at \u031f = 5rs versus L in figure\n12. We calculated the luminosity L by integrating the\nradiative cooling rate over 1.6rs < \u031f < 500rs for a given\nmass-accretion rate. Note that the most luminous region\nis not the inner boundary, but the region around the radius of the critical point where the surface density is high.\nThe Compton y parameter is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4kTe\n4kTe\n1\n+\n\u03c4es (1 + \u03c4es ) .\n(45)\ny\u2261\nme c2\nme c2\n\u22125\nWhen the luminosity is very low (L <\n\u223c 10 LEdd ), both\nthe energy transfer from ions to electrons and the radiative cooling are extremely inefficient, because the surface\ndensity is very low. Thus heat advection is dominant for\nnot only ions, but also electrons, Qad,i \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03b4heat )Q+ and\nQad,e \u223c \u03b4heat Q+ . The electron and ion temperatures are\ndetermined mainly by these energy equations. Since the\nheat-advection terms and the magnetic-heating term have\nthe same dependence on the mass accretion rate, the electron and ion temperatures are independent of the mass\naccretion rate (hence the luminosity), and are roughly the\nvirial temperatures, respectively.\nWhen the luminosity is below and close to the maxi<\nmum luminosity for the ADAF/RIAF (10\u22125 LEdd <\n\u223cL\u223c\n0.4\u03b12 LEdd \u223c 0.001LEdd), the radiative cooling becomes\n+\nefficient for electrons, Qad,e + Q\u2212\nrad \u223c \u03b4heat Q , because\nthe surface density is relatively high. However, the heat\nadvection still remains dominant for ions, Qad,i \u223c (1 \u2212\n\u03b4heat )Q+ . As a result, the electron temperature weakly\nanti-correlates with the luminosity, while the ion temperature still remains constant.\nWhen the luminosity exceeds the maximum luminosity\nfor the ADAF/RIAF (L >\n\u223c 0.001LEdd), the radiative cooling and the energy transfer from ions to electrons become\n+\nie\nie\n+\ndominant, Q\u2212\nrad \u223c \u03b4heat Q + Q and Q \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03b4heat )Q .\nHence, electrons receive a substantial fraction of the magnetic heating, and the radiative cooling balances the mag+\nnetic heating, Q\u2212\nrad \u223c Q . In other words, electrons and\nions are strongly coupled via Coulomb collisions, and the\nflow is radiatively efficient. As a result, the electron temperature strongly anti-correlates with the luminosity.\nWhen the luminosity is high, the Compton y parameter\ncorrelates with the luminosity for \u03b6 = 0.9 and 0.75, and\nanti-correlates with the luminosity for \u03b6 = 0.5.\nWe show these relations for the case \u03b1 = 0.2 in figure\n13 and figure 14. In this case, the maximum mass accretion rate and the luminosity for the ADAF/RIAF increases (\u1e40c,A \u223c 0.05\u1e40Edd and Lc,A \u223c 0.016LEdd). The\nluminosity in the low-\u03b2 disk branch exceeds \u223c 0.1LEdd.\nThe Compton y parameter correlates with the luminosity\nfor all cases because the electron temperature is relatively\nhigh and gently decreases with the luminosity compared\nto the results for the case \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\n5.\n\n9\n\nDiscussion\n\nFirst, we briefly remark why we can obtain low-\u03b2 disk\nsolutions. In our model, a decrease in the gas pressure\nresults in an increase in the magnetic pressure because due\nto the conservation of the magnetic flux advection rate at\na certain radius. Therefore, even if an efficient radiative\ncooling decreases the gas pressure, the magnetic pressure\ncan increase and support the disk in the vertical direction.\nIn addition, the magnetic heating being proportional to\nthe total pressure can balance such an efficient radiative\ncooling. In this way, we can obtain low-\u03b2 disk solutions.\nWe also remark that such low-\u03b2 disks are essentially different from MDAFs in terms of the energy balance and the\nconfiguration of magnetic fields. The MDAFs appear in\nthe innermost plunging region of optically thin accretion\ndisks in global MHD and general relativistic MHD simulations (e.g., Fragile & Meier 2009). Outside the innermost\nplunging region, the magnetic fields become turbulent because the growth timescale of the MRI is shorter than the\ninflow timescale. The generation of magnetic turbulence\nowing to the MRI balances the dissipation, and the dissipated energy is converted into thermal energy efficiently.\nIn such flows, the magnetic heating rate is consistent with\nthe prediction of the \u03b1-prescription of the stress tensor,\nthat is, proportional to the total pressure. This heating\nbalances the heat advection in the ADAF/RIAF and the\nradiative cooling in the low-\u03b2 disk. In addition, the magnetic fields are dominated by the azimuthal component because the timescale of the stretching of the magnetic fields\nowing to the shear motion is also shorter than the inflow\ntimescale. On the other hand, in the innermost plunging\nregion, the ratio of the time scales is reversed, because\nthe inflow velocity increases with decreasing the radius\nand exceeds the Alfv\u00e9n velocity. Therefore, the magnetic\nfield lines are stretched out in the radial direction before\nthe MRI grows, and generates turbulence. Since there is\nno turbulence, no dissipation occurs. As a result, a substantial fraction of the gravitational energy is converted\ninto the radial infall kinetic energy without being converted into thermal energy. In such flows, the magnetic\nheating rate predicted by the \u03b1-prescription can no longer\nbe valid, and there is almost no heating. Hence, the gas\npressure and temperature become low, and the flow becomes magnetically-dominated. To sum up, in the low-\u03b2\ndisk, the magnetic fields are turbulent and dominated by\nthe azimuthal component, and the magnetic heating balances the radiative cooling. However, in the MDAF very\nclose to the black hole, the magnetic fields are coherent\nand dominated by the radial component, and there is no\nmagnetic heating. Although both the low-\u03b2 disk and the\nMDAF are cool and magnetically-dominated, they are essentially different.\n5.1.\n\nTransition from ADAF/RIAF to Low-\u03b2 Disk\nthrough LHAF\n\nIn this subsection, we describe how the ADAF/RIAF\nundergoes a transition to the low-\u03b2 disk as the mass accretion rate increases. The transition is illustrated schemat-\n\n\f10\n\nH. Oda et al.\n\nically in figure 15.\nWhen the mass-accretion rate is below the maximum\nmass-accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF, we obtained the\nADAF/RIAF solutions that are essentially the same as\nthe solutions of the conventional model (bottom panel in\nfigure 15).\nAt the mass-accretion rate slightly exceeding the maximum mass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF, the radiative cooling overwhelms the heat advection, working\nas effective cooling in the middle region (\u031f \u223c 50rs ). The\ngas pressure decreases due to the radiative cooling while\nthe magnetic pressure increases because of the conservation of magnetic flux advection rates given at a radius.\nIn this way, the magnetic pressure becomes dominant and\nsupports the disk in this region, and the flow undergoes a\ntransition from the outer ADAF/RIAF to the low-\u03b2 disk.\nThe LHAF appears in this narrow transition layer from\nthe outer ADAF/RIAF to the low-\u03b2 disk because such a\nflow configuration results in the negative entropy gradient. In the inner region (\u031f <\n\u223c 10rs ), the radiative cooling is still inefficient because the surface density decreases\nand the radial velocity steeply increases with decreasing\nthe radius (such a feature is more prominent for lower\n\u03b1; see also Nakamura et al. 1997; Narayan et al. 1997).\nTherefore, the flow returns to the ADAF/RIAF. As a result, the flow is composed of the outer ADAF/RIAF, the\nLHAF inside the narrow transition layer, the low-\u03b2 disk,\nand the inner ADAF/RIAF (third panel in figure 15).\nWe note that such an inner ADAF/RIAF cannot be obtained from self-similar solutions of optically thin disks.\nIn the self-similar solutions, the radiative cooling can be\nefficient, even in the inner region because the surface density increases and the radial velocity gently increases with\ndecreasing radius (\u03a3 \u221d \u031f\u22121/2 , v\u031f \u221d \u031f\u22121/2 ). However,\nthe self-similar solutions are no longer valid in the inner\nregion because of the transonic nature of the flow.\nAs the mass-accretion rate increases further, the radiative cooling becomes more efficient over the whole region.\nThus, the transition layer between the outer ADAF/RIAF\nand the low-\u03b2 disk retreats, and the inner ADAF/RIAF\nregion diminishes. In other words, the low-\u03b2 region becomes wider. Eventually, the whole region becomes the\nlow-\u03b2 disk, except in the innermost ADAF/RIAF region\naround the radius of the critical point (first panel in figure\n15).\n5.2.\n\nDynamical Property\n\nTransonic flows around black holes with the \u03b1prescription of the stress tensor are divided into two\nclasses according to the value of \u03b1, a pressure-gradientdriven flow for small \u03b1 and a viscous-driven flow for\nlarge \u03b1 (e.g., Matsumoto et al. 1984; Nakamura et al.\n1997; Narayan et al. 1997). We calculated the solution\nwith \u03b1 = 0.05 as an example of the pressure-gradientdriven flow and the solution with \u03b1 = 0.2 as an example\nof the viscous-driven flow.\nFirst, we discuss the case for \u03b1 = 0.05. When the massaccretion rate is around or above the maximum massaccretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF, the surface density\n\n[Vol. ,\n\ndecreases and the radial velocity increases sharply with\ndecreasing the radius in the inner region (\u031f <\n\u223c 10rs ). Just\noutside the radius of the critical point, the angular momentum of the flow approaches and exceeds the Keplerian\nangular momentum. In this region, the primary inward\nforce is the pressure gradient force.\nNext, we discuss the case for \u03b1 = 0.2. In this case, the\nradial distribution of the surface density is relatively flat\ncompared to the case for \u03b1 = 0.05 and the angular momentum is always below the Keplerian angular momentum.\nJust outside the radius of the critical point, the primal\ninward force is the effective centrifugal force; that is, the\ngas falls inward due to losses of its angular momentum.\nOur solutions have essentially the same nature of transonic flows just outside the radius of the critical point as\nthe conventional model. In addition to this nature, we\nfound that the primal inward force is the magnetic tension force at some distance from the radius of the critical\npoint; that is, the magnetic tension pushes the disk gas\nmore strongly than the other forces in this region. This is\na new finding of our results. The magnetic field can contribute to not only the vertical hydrostatic balance, but\nalso the radial force balance in some part of the disk.\n5.3.\n\nApplication to Bright/Hard State during Bright\nHard-to-Soft Transition\n\nThe relations between \u03a3 versus \u1e40 , Te , Ti , and \u03b2 are\nconsistent with the thermal equilibrium solutions presented by Oda et al. (2010). We note that the LHAF\nbranches do not appear at such an inner region, because\nthe transition layer from the outer ADAF/RIAF to the\nlow-\u03b2 disk appears in the middle region (\u031f \u223c 50rs ) first,\nand retreats as the mass accretion rate increases.\nWe calculated the luminosity by integrating the radiative cooing rate over 1.6rs < \u031f < 500rs . When the lu\u22125\nminosity is very low (L <\n\u223c 10 LEdd for \u03b1 = 0.05 and\n\u22124\n<\nL \u223c 10 LEdd for \u03b1 = 0.2), the electron temperature is\nroughly independent of the luminosity and \u223c 1010.3 K.\nThis indicates that the cutoff energy in the X-ray spectrum is independent of the luminosity (the clear cutoff at\nsuch a low luminosity, however, may not be detectable).\nWhen the luminosity is below the maximum luminosity for the ADAF/RIAF, (L <\n\u223c 0.001LEdd for \u03b1 = 0.05\n0.016L\nfor\n\u03b1\n=\n0.2),\nthe electron temperature\nand L <\nEdd\n\u223c\nweakly anti-correlates with the luminosity in the range\nfrom \u223c 109.5 K to \u223c 1010.3 K. Note that the minimum electron temperature for the ADAF/RIAF is roughly independent of the value of \u03b1. This feature agrees with the\nresult presented by Esin et al. (1998). This weak anticorrelation between the electron temperature and the luminosity in the high electron temperature region can be\nconsistent with the weak anti-correlation between the energy cutoff and the luminosity observed in the low/hard\nstate. However, the ADAF/RIAF cannot account for the\nelectron temperature lower than \u223c 109.5 K.\nWhen the luminosity is above the maximum luminosity\nfor the ADAF/RIAF, the electron temperature strongly\nanti-correlates with the luminosity in the range from \u223c\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nMagnetically Supported Accretion Disk\n\n108 K to \u223c 109.5 K. This strong anti-correlation in the relatively low electron temperature and high luminosity region\ncan be consistent with the anti-correlation between the energy cutoff and the luminosity observed in the bright/hard\nstate. Therefore, we conclude that the low-\u03b2 disk can account for the bright/hard state, and that the transition\nfrom the ADAF/RIAF to the low-\u03b2 disk corresponds to\nthe transition from the low/hard state to the bright/hard\nstate during the bright hard-to-soft transition.\nWe also touch on the possibility of the dark hard-to-soft\ntransition during which the system immediately undergoes a transition from the low/hard state to the high/soft\nstate at a low luminosity. When \u03b6 has a small value, and\nthus, the magnetic flux advection rate is very low in the\ninner region, we could not obtain an optically thin global\nsolution at a mass-accretion rate higher than the maximum mass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF. In this\ncase, we expect that the ADAF/RIAF undergoes a transition to an optically thick disk (e.g., the standard disk,\nthe slim disk, and an optically thick low-\u03b2 disk) with the\nLHAF transition layer. This might correspond to the dark\nhard-to-soft transition.\n5.4.\n\nWhat Mechanism Determines the Magnetic Flux\nAdvection Rate?\n\nWe propose a possible scenario that what mechanism\ndetermines whether the system undergoes the bright\nhard-to-soft transition or the dark hard-to-soft transition. Three-dimensional MHD/Radiation-MHD simulations showed that the polarity of the azimuthal magnetic\nfield inside the disk can change in time alternately in\nthe ADAF/RIAF and the standard disk, that is, the gas\npressure dominant disk (e.g., Nishikori et al. 2006; Shi\net al. 2010). Large filament-like structures of magnetic\nfields emerge from the mid plane of the disk and rise up,\nroughly, in the growth timescale of the Parker instability. Subsequently, reversals of azimuthal magnetic fields\ntake place in the mid plane, and the polarity of azimuthal\nmagnetic fields alternates successively. (Note that such\na change in polarity can be suppressed in the low-\u03b2 disk\nbecause the growth timescale of the Parker instability is\nquite long). The pattern of the polarity is symmetrical\nwith respect to the equatorial plane roughly, but not exactly. Hence, the magnetic flux advection rate inside the\ndisk can change in time.\nIf the mass-accretion rate exceeds the threshold for the\nonset of the cooling instability when the magnetic flux\nadvection rate is high on average, the ADAF/RIAF will\nevolve toward the low-\u03b2 disk with the LHAF transition\nlayer. In this case, we can expect that the system undergoes the bright hard-to-soft transition. On the other hand,\nif the mass accretion rate exceeds the threshold when the\nmagnetic flux advection rate is low, the ADAF/RIAF will\nevolve toward an optically thick disk with the LHAF transition layer. In this case, we can expect the dark hard-tosoft transition.\n\n5.5.\n\nBeyond the Low-\u03b2 Disk:\nRelativistic Jets\n\n11\nEpisodic Ejections of\n\nAccording to Pessah and Psaltis (2005), the MRI is stabilized for toroidal Alfv\u00e9n speeds exceeding the geometrical mean of the sound speed and the rotational speed of\n\u221a\nthe disk gas (vA >\n\u223c cs vK0 ). In mildly low-\u03b2 disk solutions\nat moderately high mass accretion rates, this condition is\nnot satisfied, that is, the MRI is not stabilized. On the\nother hand, in extremely low-\u03b2 disk solutions at very highmass accretion rates, this condition is satisfied in a certain\nregion, and thus, the MRI can be stabilized. Hence, we expect that no magnetic turbulence can be driven, and then\nno magnetic heating can occur in this region (although\nthe amplification of azimuthal magnetic fields due to the\nshear motion may still survive). Therefore, the cooling instability will occur and the disk will shrink further in the\nvertical direction. As a result, the magnetic field strength\nand energy inside the disk can be amplified further. Such\na drastic and further increase in the magnetic field energy\nmay lead to an explosive energy release (e.g, Shibata et\nal. 1990; Yuan et al. 2009). The timing analyses on the\nX-ray spectrum and the radio emission of BHCs suggest\nthat episodic ejections of relativistic jets take place during the transition from the bright/hard state to the soft\nstate (e.g., Fender et al. 2009). This explosive energy release from the low-\u03b2 disk may be an origin of the episodic\nejections of relativistic jets.\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have calculated vertically integrated, onedimensional, steady-state global solutions of optically\nthin, two-temperature, black hole accretion disks incorporating the mean azimuthal magnetic fields. We\nhave obtained the magnetic pressure dominant (low-\u03b2)\ndisk solutions at high mass-accretion rates. We have\nconcluded that the low-\u03b2 disk can account for the\nbright/hard state (or simply, the brightening of the hard\nstate) observed during the bright hard-to-soft transition\nin transient outbursts of BHCs.\nWe have assumed that the \u031f\u03c6-component of the azimuthally averaged Maxwell stress tensor is proportional\nto the sum of the gas and magnetic pressure. We have also\nprescribed the radial distribution of the magnetic flux advection rate by introducing the parameter \u03b6 in order to\ncomplete the set of basic equations. Accordingly, a decrease in temperature results in an increase in magnetic\npressure under conservation of the magnetic flux advection rate at each radius, and the magnetic heating being\nproportional to the total pressure can balance the radiative cooling.\nWhen the mass-accretion rate is below the maximum\nmass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF, we obtained the\nusual ADAF/RIAF solutions. When the mass accretion\nrate is just beyond the maximum mass accretion rate for\nthe ADAF/RIAF, we obtained the solutions of the flow\ncomposed of the outer ADAF/RIAF, the LHAF inside the\ntransition layer from the outer ADAF/RIAF to the low-\n\n\f12\n\nH.

This\nlow-\u03b2 disk region becomes wider as the mass-accretion\nrate increases further. Eventually, the whole region becomes the low-\u03b2 disk, except in the innermost plunging\nregion around the radius of the critical point. The electron temperature decreases from \u223c 109.5K to \u223c 108K with\nincreasing the luminosity above the maximum luminosity\n2\nfor the ADAF/RIAF (L >\n\u223c 0.4\u03b1 LEdd ). This is consistent\nwith the anti-correlation between the energy cutoff in the\nX-ray spectrum (hence the electron temperature) and the\nluminosity when L >\n\u223c 0.1LEdd, observed in the bright/hard\nstate during the bright hard-to-soft transition of BHCs.\nWhen we assumed very low magnetic flux advection\nrates, we could not obtain the low-\u03b2 disk solutions. In\nthis case, we expect that the flow will be composed of the\nouter ADAF/RIAF, the LHAF inside the transition layer\nfrom the outer ADAF/RIAF to an inner optically thick\ndisk, and the inner optically thick disk at the maximum\nmass accretion rate for the ADAF/RIAF. This might correspond to the dark hard-to-soft transition.\nAlthough we could obtain the extremely low-\u03b2 disk solution at a very high mass accretion rate, the MRI can be\nstabilized in such an extremely low-\u03b2 plasma. Hence, the\nmagnetic heating due to turbulent magnetic fields may\nnot occur under such an extremely low-\u03b2 regime. In this\ncase, the cooling instability will occur and the disk will\nshrink further in the vertical direction. As a result, the\nmagnetic field energy can be amplified further. Such a\ndrastic increase in magnetic field energy may lead to an\nexplosive energy release. This can be an origin of the\nepisodic ejections of relativistic jets observed during the\nbright hard-to-soft transition.\n\nwhere\n\nWe would like to thank Feng Yuan for helpful discussions and comments.
