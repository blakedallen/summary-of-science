For example inequivalence of the microcanonical\nand canonical ensembles, negative specific heat, violent relaxation (rapid relaxation towards\na non-gaussian quasi-stationary state), superdiffusion and aging [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The most\nobvious example of long-range interaction is the gravitational force, which is difficult to\nstudy due to its divergence at short distances. A quite simple model that retains most\nof the behavior found in realistic systems is the so-called Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF)\nmodel (see [6, 7, 8, 9] and references therein). Recently some authors proposed that the\nTsallis entropy could describe the statistical properties of such systems [10, 11, 12, 13],\nalthough some criticism has been raised in the literature [8, 14, 15]. Here we present a\ndifferent approach which can shed some light on the problem, and also discuss some relevant\naspects of the meaning of temperature for long-range interacting systems.\nLet us first consider a system of N identical particles described by the Hamiltonian\nN\nX\n\nN\nX\np2i\nH=\n+\n\u03c6(ri \u2212 rj ),\ni=1 2m\ni<j=1\n\n(1)\n\nwith pi and ri the momentum and position of the i-th particle respectively, andi \u03c6 is the\ninteraction potential. The force is long-ranged if the potential decays at long distances as\n|ri \u2212 rj |\u2212\u03b1 with \u03b1 < D, with D the spatial dimension. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e the inter-particle\ncorrelations are negligible, and the system is described in the mean-field approximation by\nthe Vlasov equation [16, 17]:\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n+v*\n+F*\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202v\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f is the one-particle mass distribution function in phase space and F(r) =\n\u2212\u2202U(r)/\u2202r is the mean-field force. The mean-field potential is given by U(r) =\n\nr\u2032 )f (p\u2032 , r\u2032 , t)dD p\u2032 dD r\u2032 . The Casimir functionals Cs [f ] =\n\nR\n\nR\n\n\u03c6(r \u2212\n\ns(f (p, r, t))dD p dD r are conserved\n\nby the Vlasov dynamics, where s(f ) is an arbitrary function of f . This implies that the\nVlasov equation (2) admits an infinity of stable stationary solutions. Any distribution which\nis an extremum (maximum or minimum) of a Casimir Cs for a given function s(f ) is a stable\nstationary solution of the Vlasov equation.\nHowever real systems have always a finite number of particles, and corrections of order\n1/N must be considered to take into account collisional processes, that are important in the\nvery long-time regime and for systems with a number of particles not sufficiently large. The\n2\n\n\fkinetic equation in either case can be obtained in different ways and we refer the reader to\nReference [17] for details. Nevertheless even for finite N the stationary state of the Vlasov\nequation describes, for a sufficiently long time, a quasi-stationary state of the real system\n(up to O(1/N) effects).\n\nThe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is given by S = \u2212 fN log fN dD r1 * * * dD rN dD p1 * * * dD pN ,\nR\n\nwhere fN is the complete N-particle distribution function. In the mean-field limit (N \u2192 \u221e)\nthe distribution fN factorizes as fN (r1 , . . . , rN , p1 , . . . , pN , t) = f (p1 , r1 , t) * * * f (pN , rN , t),\nand the entropy is thus written as\nS = \u2212N\n\nZ\n\nf (r, p, t) log f (r, p, t) dD r dD p.\n\n(3)\n\nThe maximization of the entropy S subject to the energy and normalization constraints:\nH=\n\nZ\n\np2\n1\nf (r, p, t) dD r dD p +\n2m\n2\n\nZ\n\nI=\n\n\u03c6(r \u2212 r\u2032 )f (r, p, t)f (r\u2032, p\u2032 , t) dD r dD r\u2032 dD p dD p\u2032 = E, (4)\nZ\n\nf (r, p, t) dD r dD p = 1,\n\n(5)\n\nleads to the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The stationary states of the Vlasov\ndynamics are obtained by maximizing a Casimir Cs with the constrains in eqs. (4) and (5).\nThis Casimir plays the role of a \"generalized entropy\", and the sign of its second variation\nyields the stability condition for the stationary state. This is the procedure adopted in\nReference [8] to study the stability of stationary states of the HMF model. This model\ndescribes a system of N interacting planar rotors with hamiltonian (1), ri = \u03b8i , m = 1 and\ninteracting potential \u03c6(ri \u2212 rj ) = v(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) \u2261 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ), and such that pi is the angular\nmomentum conjugate to the angle \u03b8i . We note that in this model the time evolution presents\nviolent relaxation into a quasi-stationary state with a life-time diverging with increasing N\nand ensemble inequivalence, and is therefore a prototypical model for the study of long-range\ninteracting systems [2, 7].\nIn order to undestrand the nature of the entropy in systems with long-range interactions,\nwe suppose that all microstates compatible with the given constraints are equally probable.\nThis amounts to maximize the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy in the mean-field limit (eq. 3)\nwith the constraints shown in eqs. (4) and (5) and all the Casimirs, and for all possible\nfunctions s. Of course this is not an easy task since we have an infinite non-enumerable set of\nconstraints. Nevertheless we can simplify this problem by restricting ourselves to analytical\ndistribution functions (i. e. functions of class C \u221e ), which is not a restriction for almost all\n3\n\n\fphysical situations. Following this reasoning, the only non-vanishing Lagrange multipliers\nare those associated to the energy and normalization constrains as well as those associated\nwith Casimirs defined by an analytic function s. It is therefore equivalent to consider only\nthe Casimirs of the form Cn [f ] =\n\nR\n\nf n dD rdD p, with n = 1, 2, 3, . . . The extremum of S under\n\nthese Casimir and eqs. (4), (5) constraints is equivalent to the extremum of the functional\nF =\n\n1\nS\nN\n\n\u2212 \u03bbH H \u2212 \u03bbI I \u2212\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=2\n\n\u03bbn Cn , where \u03bbH , \u03bbI and \u03bbn are Lagrange multipliers. The\n\n1/N factor is introduced for convenience and is equivalent to a rescaling of the Lagrange\nmultipliers. Computing the functional derivative of F with respect to f we have:\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b4F [f ]\nn\u03bbn f n\u22121 = 0,\n= \u2212 log f \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03bbI \u2212 \u03bbH e(r, p) \u2212\n\u03b4f\nn=2\n\n(6)\n\nwith e(r, p) = p2 /2m + U(r), and thus\nG(f ) \u2261 log f + \u03bbI + 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nn\u03bbn f n\u22121 = \u2212\u03bbH e(r, p).\n\n(7)\n\nSupposing the function G is invertible we obtain f (r, p) = G\u22121 (\u2212\u03bbH e(r, p)) \u2261 \u03a6(e(r, p)).\nDistributions of this form are precisely the stationary states of the Vlasov equation. Since\ne(r, p) depends on f (r, p) the latter is given self-consistently. For a homogeneous system,\nthe mean force vanishes and e(r, p) = p2 /2m. At this point we note that if f never vanishes,\nthen G is analytic as a function of f , and any analytic function G can be written in the form\nof eq. (7), i. e. it is obtained considering only the Casimirs with s(f ) = f n . We conclude\nthat we can take the Lagrange multipliers associated with Casimirs other than Cn [f ] equal\nto zero.\nThe stability of a stationary state is usually determined by requiring that it is an extremum (maximum or minimum) of a given Casimir under the energy and normalization\nconstraints [8]. In the present approach, stability is associated to the condition of maximal\nentropy, i. e. neither a minimum nor a saddle point. The equivalence of criteria should also\nbe proved. In this letter we will restrict ourselses to the case of homogeneous stationary\nstates of the HMF model for the sake of a more succinct presentation.\nSimilarly to Reference [8] we first define the x and y components of the total magnetization\nof the system of plane rotors by\nMx [f ] =\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03b8, p, t) cos \u03b8 d\u03b8 dp;\n\n4\n\nMy [f ] =\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03b8, p, t) sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 dp.\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe second variation of F [f ] computed at the extremum f0 (\u03b8, p) must be negative for a\nmaximum.

Thus the condition of maximal entropy\nsubject to all Casimir invariants leads to the same condition as obtained from the non-linear\nstability analysis of Yamaguchi et al. [8] by imposing that the state is the extremum of a\ngiven Casimir.\nOnce the form of the entropy is known, the temperature of the system may be defined by\n1/T = \u2202S/\u2202E. This is not necessarily identical to the Lagrange multiplier \u03bbH associated to\nthe energy constraint. The temperature T is not the only relevant parameter to characterize\nthe meta-equilibrium states of the system corresponding to the stationary states of the\nVlasov equation. Indeed for two similar systems, with all its constituents interacting with\n5\n\n\fthe same long-range force, the condition of statistical equilibrium (most probable state) is\nsuch that the temperature and the derivative of S with respect to to all Casimirs have the\nsame value for both systems. On the contrary if one tries to probe the temperature of the\nsystem using a smaller system (thermometer) in such a way that its interaction is different in\nnature, i. e. a short range interaction, then the equilibrium state will be attained only after\na very long time, of the order of the relaxation time of the whole system, when both systems\nreach a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. In fact this is an expected behavior since\neven a small system is sufficient to break the time invariance of the Casimirs. In order to\nillustrate this point, the HMF model is modified to include a term that describes a system\nwith a short-range interaction ans a coupling term [18]:\nH=\n\nN1X\n+N2\ni=1\n\nN1X\n+N2\nN1\nN2\nX\np2i\n1 X\nv(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) +\nv(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i+N1 ),\nv(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i+1 ) + \u03c3\n+\n2\nN1 i<j=1\ni=1\ni=N1 +1\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is a coupling constant, N1 and N2 the number of particles in system 1 (with longrange interaction) and system 2 (with short-range interaction), respectively. We integrate\nnumerically the hamiltonian equations using the fourth order simpletic integrator of Reference [19]. For system 1 we have chosen the well-studied \"water-bag\" initial condition with\nan uniform distribution for the angular moments in the interval [\u2212p0 , p0 ] and a completely\n\u221a\nuniform distribution for the angles, and p0 = 6U1 \u2212 3 where U1 is the energy per particle,\nand the total potential energy is N1 /2. This state is the limit of a family of analytic distributions of the form f (\u03b8, p) = C {1 + tanh [a (p20 + p2 ))]} , for a \u2192 \u221e (C is a normalization\nconstant). The water-bag state is stable for an energy per particle U > 7/12 [8]. We also\nconsider for system 2 a water-bag initial condition but with \u03b8i = 0. In order to have a small\nthermal coupling between the two systems we fix \u03c3 = 0.05. It can be easily shown that\nthe temperature for the water-bag state is also half the kinetic energy per particle. Figure 1 shows the time evolution for the kinetic and potential energies of both systems with\nN1 = 100, 000 and N2 = 100 in such a way that system 2 acts like a small thermometer. System 1 stays in the water-bag state, while system 2 do not thermalize. Eventually after a very\nlong time they will both reach the standard canonical equilibrium. The attempt to define a\nthermometer to measure the temperature of these systems as reported by Baldovin et al. [18]\nworks only for a very special type of initial condition, and cannot be reproduced for more\ngeneral states. In fact if the long-range interacting system is in contact with a thermal bath\nat a given temperature, the only possible equilibrium is the Maxwellian distribution.

The\ninteraction is turned on at t = 100.\n\nis essentially the reason why the microcanonical and canonical ensembles are not equivalent.\nFigure 2a shows the kinetic and potential energies for the case N1 = N2 = 100, 000. Now\nthe water-bag initial condition is rapidly perturbed when the interaction is turned on and\nthe system evolves to a gaussian velocity distribution, as shown in Figure 2b.\nWe have shown that the condition of maximal entropy subject to the normalization,\n7\n\n\fenergy and Casimir constraints is equivalent to the non-linear stability of the stationary\nstates of the Vlasov equation. Therefore, in the mean-field approximation (N \u2192 \u221e), the\nentropy for a system with long-range interaction with a well behaved distribution function\ndepends on an enumerable infinite set of parameters, i. e. the Lagrange multipliers \u03bbI , \u03bbH\nand \u03bbn for n = 2, . . . , \u221e. These parameters depend in a complicated way on the values of the\nconstraints defined by the initial condition, the latter being difficult to determine in realistic\nsystems. The proposal of the Tsallis statistics, which involves only two free parameters,\nthe temperature and the entropic index q, to describe the meta-equilibrium distribution in\nsystems with long-range interaction is therefore limited in scope. It can only describe a\nspecific type of stationary state among an infinity of different possibilities. Even for a finite\nN system it was shown in Reference [8] that for a water-bag initial condition the system\neventually reaches a stationary state with an exponential tail in the distribution, contrary\nto the power law behavior of the Tsallis statistics. The reasonable fitting of simulation\ndata obtained from the Tsallis functional form stems from the fact that it depends on two\nparameters, while the Maxwellian depends only on one. Therefore for an even distribution\nfunction one can obtain a correct fit up to its fourth moment, while only the dispersion can\nbe fitted correctly using a Maxwellian distribution. It is a well known fact that distribution\nfunctions that are well behaved and that have the same first four moments are usually very\nclose. This explains why the Tsallis statistics can give good fitting up to some accuracy.\nThe small differences between the fitted function and the real function can nevertheless be\nessential as for instance if one needs a correct form for the tails of the distribution. Also the\nequilibrium properties of such systems are complicated to study since the type of coupling\nis essential to determine which constraints are kept, while for usual systems only the energy\nconstraint is present and is always preserved.\nThe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is then the correct form to be used. As an importante consequence we note that for a homogeneous state the mean field force vanishes and the entropy\nis computed using eqs. (3) and f = \u03a6(e(r, p)) with U = 0, and therefore it is both additive\nand extensive, even despite the long range-nature of the interaction. For an inhomogeneous\nstate the situation is more complicated and both properties are usually lost. The use of a\nnon-extensive entropy by its own definition is meaningless and may lead to wrong conclusions. The non-extensivity or non-additivity of the entropy results uniquely from the usual\ndefinition of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy in the presence of correlations among the con8\n\n\fstituents of the system, as in inhomogeneous states of long-range interacting systems. The\nuse of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is equivalent to suppose that all microstates compatible\nwith the given constraints are equiprobable, which is a quite reasonable assumption. Using\nany other definition of entropy introduces a non-equiprobability of states, which can result\nfrom some \"hidden\" constraints not considered explicitly (e. g. the Casimir invariants). If\nthis is so, the type of non-equiprobability changes for different values of such constraints,\nas well as the definition of the entropy, to take account of the change of the probabilities\nof the microstates. Therefore a fixed form for a generalized entropy cannot take care of all\npossible types of non-equiprobability.\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. A.
