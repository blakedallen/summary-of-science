INTRODUCTION\n\nUnderstanding how stars form from gas is vital to our comprehension of galaxy formation and evolution. Although the\nphysics involved in this process is not fully understood, we\ndo know something about the principal sites where star formation occurs and where the gas resides. Most of the known\nstar formation at high redshift occurs in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), a population of star-forming galaxies selected for\ntheir opacity at the Lyman limit and the presence of upper\nmain sequence stars that emit FUV radiation. They also have\nvery high star formation rates (SFRs) of \u223c80 M\u2299 yr\u22121 after\ncorrecting for extinction (Shapley et al. 2003).\nWhile LBGs have a wide range of morphologies, the average half-light radius for z \u223c 3 LBGs is about \u223c 2 \u2212 3 kpc in the\noptical at \u223c 25 mag (e.g., Giavalisco et al. 1996; Law et al.\n2007). However, studies of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field\n(UDF) have shown that fainter LBGs have smaller half-light\nradii, around \u223c 1 kpc for LBGs with brightnesses similar to\nthose used in this study (V \u223c 26 \u2212 27 mag; Bouwens et al.\n2004). While we have no empirical knowledge about star formation in the outer regions of LBGs, simulations suggest that\nstars may be forming further out (e.g., Gnedin & Kravtsov\n2010). It still remains an unanswered question whether star\nformation occurs in the outer disks of high redshift galaxies.\nLocal galaxies at z \u223c 0 are forming stars in their outer disks,\nas observed in the ultraviolet (Thilker et al. 2005; Bigiel et al.\n2010b,a). At low redshift, this star formation occurs in\natomic-dominated hydrogen gas (Fumagalli & Gavazzi 2008;\nBigiel et al. 2010b,a), where the majority of the hydrogen gas\nis atomic but molecules are present. At high redshift such gas\nresides in damped Ly\u03b1 systems (DLAs).\nmarcar@ucsd.edu\n1 Department of Physics and Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, UCSD, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA\n2 Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, and Kavli Institute for\nCosmological Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA\n\nDLAs are a population of H I layers selected for their neutral hydrogen column densities of NHI \u2265 2 \u00d7 1020cm\u22122 , which\ndominate the neutral-gas content of the universe in the redshift\ninterval 0 < z < 5. In fact, DLAs at z \u223c 3 contain enough gas\nto account for 25%\u201350% of the mass content of visible matter\nin modern galaxies (see Wolfe et al. 2005, for a review) and\nare neutral-gas reservoirs for star formation.\nThe locally established Kennicutt\u2013Schmidt (KS) relation\n(Kennicutt 1998a; Schmidt 1959) relates the SFR per unit area\nand the total gas surface density (atomic and molecular), \u03a3SFR\n\u221d \u03a31.4\ngas . While it is reasonable to use this relationship at low\nredshift in normal star-forming galaxies, many cosmological\nsimulations use it at all redshifts without distinguishing between atomic and molecular gas (e.g., Nagamine et al. 2004,\n2007, 2010; Razoumov et al. 2006; Brooks et al. 2007, 2009;\nPontzen et al. 2008; Razoumov et al. 2008; Razoumov 2009;\nTescari et al. 2009; Dekel et al. 2009a,b; Kere\u0161 et al. 2009;\nBarnes & Haehnelt 2010)3 . Yet at z \u223c 3, excluding regions\nimmediately surrounding high surface brightness LBGs, the\nSFR per unit comoving volume, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , of DLAs was found to\nbe less than 5% of what is expected from the KS relation\n(Wolfe & Chen 2006). This means that a lower level of in\nsitu star formation occurs in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas\nat z \u223c 3 than in modern galaxies4 .\nThese results have multiple implications affecting such gas\nat high redshift. First, the lower SFR efficiencies in DLAs\nare inconsistent with the 158\u03bcm cooling rates of DLAs with\npurely in situ star formation. Specifically, Wolfe et al. (2008)\nadopt the model of Wolfe et al. (2003b), in which star forma3 We note that there are also a large number of papers that do not assume the KS relation in their simulations and models (e.g., Kravtsov 2003;\nKrumholz et al. 2008, 2009a,b; Tassis et al. 2008; Robertson & Kravtsov\n2008; Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010, 2011; Feldmann et al. 2011).\n4 We note that the SFR efficiency discussed in this paper relates to the normalization of the KS relation, and is not the same as the star formation efficiency (SFE), which is the inverse of the gas depletion time (e.g., Leroy et al.\n2008).\n\n\f2\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\ntion generates FUV radiation that heats the gas by the grain\nphotoelectric mechanism. Assuming thermal balance, they\nequate the heating rates to the [C II] 158 \u03bcm cooling rates of\nDLAs inferred from the measured C II\u2217 \u03bb1335.7 absorption of\nDLAs (Wolfe et al. 2003b). The DLA cooling rates exhibit\na bimodal distribution (Wolfe et al. 2008), and the population\nof DLAs with high cooling rates have inferred heating rates\nsignificantly higher than that implied by the upper limits of\nFUV emission of spatially extended sources (Wolfe & Chen\n2006; Wolfe et al. 2008). Therefore, another source of heat\ninput is required, such as compact star-forming regions embedded in the neutral gas; e.g., LBGs. Second, since \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 is\ndirectly proportional to the metal production rate, the limits\non \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 shift the problem of metal overproduction in DLAs by\na factor of 10 (Pettini 1999, 2004, 2006; Wolfe et al. 2003b,\n; known as the \"Missing Metals\" problem for DLAs), to one\nof underproduction by a factor of three (Wolfe & Chen 2006).\nLastly, the multi-component velocity structure of the DLA gas\n(e.g., Prochaska & Wolfe 1997) suggests that energy input by\nsupernova explosions is required to replenish the turbulent kinetic energy lost through cloud collisions; i.e., some in situ\nstar formation should be present in DLAs.\nOne possible way to reconcile the lack of detected in situ\nstar formation in DLAs at high redshift and the properties\nof DLAs that require heating of the gas, is that compact\nLBG cores embedded in spatially extended DLA gas may\ncause both the heat input, chemical enrichment, and turbulent kinetic energy observed in DLAs. There are several independent lines of evidence linking DLAs and LBGs; e.g.\n(1) there is a significant cross correlation between LBGs\nand DLAs (Cooke et al. 2006), (2) the identification of a\nnumber of high-z DLAs associated with LBGs (M\u00f8ller et al.\n2002a,b; Chen et al. 2009; Fynbo et al. 2010; Fumagalli et al.\n2010; Cooke et al. 2010), (3) the occurrence of Ly-\u03b1 emission observed in the center of DLA troughs (M\u00f8ller et al.\n2004; Cooke et al. 2010), and (4) the appearance of DLAs\nin the spectra of rare lensed LBGs at high redshift, where\nthe DLA and LBG have similar redshifts (Pettini et al. 2002b;\nCabanac et al. 2008; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2010).\nIn fact, recent results are consistent with the idea that gas in\nspatially extended DLAs encompasses compact LBGs. Erb\n(2008) demonstrated that LBGs are rapidly running out of\n\"fuel\" for star formation, and cold (T \u223c100 K) gas in DLAs\nis a natural fuel source. This finding is supported by the\nmeasurements of the SFR and gas densities of LBGs by\nTacconi et al. (2010). We note that if DLAs are the fuel\nsource for the LBGs, the DLAs in turn would have to be\nreplenished since the comoving density of DLAs at its peak\n(z \u223c 3.5) is about 1/3 the current cosmic mass density of\nstars (Prochaska & Wolfe 2009). Presumably, they are replenished through accretion of warm (T \u223c 104 K) ionized\nflows5 (Dekel & Birnboim 2006, 2008; Dekel et al. 2009a,b;\nBauermeister et al. 2010).\nWhile LBGs embedded in spatially extended DLA gas help\nresolve some properties of DLAs, it is problematic whether\nmetal-enriched outflows from LBGs can supply the required\nmetals seen in DLAs. Nor is it clear whether such outflows\ncan generate turbulent kinetic energy at rates sufficient to balance dissipative losses arising from cloud collisions implied\nby the multi-component velocity structure of DLAs6 . We note\n5 Often referred to as \"cold\" flows, but we call them warm flows since cold\nrefers to T \u223c100K gas in this paper.\n6 The cloud crossing time is t\ncross = H/v and the cloud collision time is\n\nthat Fumagalli et al. (2011) show that that the filamentary gas\nstructures in the cold mode accretion scenario that provide\ngalaxies with fresh fuel (e.g., Dekel et al. 2009a; Kere\u0161 et al.\n2009) are not sufficiently dense to produce DLA absorption,\nnor do these filaments have a large enough area covering fraction (Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kere\u0161 2011). The only location with\nsufficient covering fraction and high enough densities for the\ngas to become self shielded is in the vicinity around galaxies\n(2-10kpc).\nTo address these issues, we adopt the working hypothesis\nthat in situ star formation occurs in the presence of atomicdominated gas in the outskirts of LBGs, similar to the outer\ndisks of local galaxies. Since most of the atomic-dominated\ngas at high redshift is in DLAs, we assume that this is DLA\ngas. We emphasize that while the past results (Wolfe & Chen\n2006) set sensitive upper limits on in situ star formation in\nDLAs without compact star-forming regions like LBGs, no\nsuch limits exist for DLAs containing such objects.\nFor these reasons we search for spatially extended star formation associated with LBGs at z \u223c 3 by looking for regions\nof low surface brightness (LSB) emission surrounding the\nLBG cores. We are searching for in situ star formation on\nscales up to \u223c 10 kpc, where the detection of faint emission\nwould indicate the presence of spatially extended star formation. It would also uncover a mode of star formation hitherto unknown at high z, and could help solve the dilemmas\ncited above. We test the hypotheses that (1) the extended\nstar formation is fueled by atomic-dominated gas as probed\nby the DLAs, and (2) star formation occurs at the KS rate.\nThat is, we consider whether star formation occurs in the outskirts of LBGs, whether that star formation occurs in atomicdominated gas, and at what SFR efficiency the stars form.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observations used, and in Section 3 we we identify a\nsample of compact LBGs at z \u223c 3 to search for extended LSB\nemission around the compact cores of the LBGs. In Section 4,\nwe describe the image stacking technique, measure a median\nradial profile of the extended LSB emission, and discuss possible selection biases of the observations. In Section 5, based\non the observed radial profile, we calculate the corresponding\nSFR surface density distribution and the sky covering fraction\nof the extended LSB emission. We then calculate the in situ\nSFR density and metal production in these extended LSB regions. In Section 6, we develop a theoretical framework to\nconnect known DLA statistics to the observed surface density\ndistribution of SFR in the outskirts of LBGs, and to obtain an\nempirical estimate of the star formation efficiency in distant\ngalaxies. In Section 7, we discuss the impacts of our analysis in understanding the star formation relation in the distant\nuniverse, and in interpreting the observed low metal content\nof the DLA population.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the AB magnitude system\nand an (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b , h) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.7) cosmology.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\nWe implement our search for spatially extended star formation around z \u223c 3 LBGs in the most sensitive high-resolution\n1\n, where H is the DLA scale height, v is the cloud velocity, n is the\ntcoll \u2243 n\u03c3v\nnumber density of clouds, and \u03c3 is the geometric cross section of the clouds.\nTherefore, the ratio of the cloud crossing time to the cloud collision time is\ntcross\n\u2243 n\u03c3H \u223c \u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the optical depth. Consequently, if \u03c4 > 1 as\ntcol\nis observed, the clouds would dissipate on a timescale short compared to the\ncrossing time (e.g., McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1999).\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\n\n3\n\n10.0\n\nNLBG in 0.5 mag bin / arcmin2\n\nRafelski et al. 2009\nSawicki et al. 2006 corrected\nReddy et al. 2009 corrected\nReddy et al. 2009 best fit\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n24\n\n25\n\n26\nV\u2212band magnitude\n\n27\n\nFigure 1.

This image is ideal because\n(1) of its high angular resolution (PSF FWHM = 0.\u2032\u2032 09), (2) at\nz \u223c 3 the V band fluxes correspond to rest-frame FUV fluxes,\nwhich are sensitive measures of SFRs, since short-lived massive stars produce the observed UV photons, and (3) the 1\u03c3\npoint source limit of V =30.5 implies high sensitivity. Since\nmost of the LBGs in the UDF are too faint for spectroscopic\nidentification, the u band is needed to find z \u223c 3 LBGs via\ntheir flux decrement due to the Lyman limit through color selection and photometric redshifts. To this end, we acquired\none of the most sensitive u band images ever obtained and\nidentified 407 LBGs at z \u223c 3 (Rafelski et al. 2009, see also\nNonino et al. (2009)).\nThroughout the paper we utilize the B, V , i\u2032 , and z\u2032 band\n(F435W, F606W, F775W, and F850LP, respectively) observations of the UDF (Beckwith et al. 2006), obtained with the\nWide Field Camera on the HST Advanced Camera for surveys\n(ACS; Ford et al. 2002). These images cover 12.80 arcmin2,\nalthough we only use the central 11.56 arcmin2 which overlaps the u band image from (Rafelski et al. 2009). The u band\nimage was obtained with the Keck I telescope and the blue\nchannel of the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS;\nOke et al. 1995; McCarthy et al. 1998) and has a 1\u03c3 depth\nof 30.7 mag arcsec\u22122 and a limiting magnitude of 27.6 mag.\nThe sample described below also makes use of the observations taken with the NICMOS camera NIC3 in the J and H\nbands (F110W and F160W; Thompson et al. 2005) whenever\nthe field of view (FOV) overlaps.\n3. SAMPLE SELECTION\n\nIn order to search for spatially extended star formation associated with z \u223c 3 LBGs, we require a sample of such galaxies\nto form a super-stack of LBG images that we describe here. In\nSection 3.1, we compare the number counts of the z \u223c 3 LBGs\nin the UDF to those in the literature. Then in Section 3.2, we\nselect a subsample that is appropriate for stacking in order\nto improve the signal-to-noise (S/N) in the LBG outskirts as\n\ndescribed in Section 4. Lastly, in Section 3.3 we investigate\npossible selection biases of the observations.\nThe samples in this paper are based on the z \u223c 3 LBG sample of Rafelski et al. (2009), which contains 407 LBGs selected by using a combination of photometric redshifts and\nthe u band drop out technique (Steidel & Hamilton 1992;\nSteidel et al. 1995, 1996a,b). This selection of LBGs is enabled by the extremely deep u band image described in Section 2, needed to reduce the traditional degeneracy of colors between z \u223c 3 and z \u223c 0.2 galaxies that can yield incorrect redshifts at z \u223c 3 without the u band (Ellis 1997;\nFern\u00e1ndez-Soto et al. 1999; Ben\u00edtez 2000; Rafelski et al.\n2009). Rafelski et al. (2009) found that the resultant sample\nis likely to have a contamination fraction of only \u223c 3%. Any\nsuch contamination will have a minimal effect on our results\nand is included in the uncertainties (see Section 4.3). In addition, Rafelski et al. (2009) found that the LBG sample is\ncomplete to V \u223c 27 mag, limited by the depth of the u band\nimage.\n3.1. Number Counts\nIn order to (1) be confident in our sample selection, (2)\nverify that we are probing the correct comoving volume,\nand (3) make completeness corrections in Sections 5 and\n6 (as described in Appendix A), we compare the number counts of the z \u223c 3 LBG selection from Rafelski et al.\n(2009) to the completeness corrected number counts from\nSawicki & Thompson (2006) and Reddy & Steidel (2009)\nin Figure 1. The uncertainties shown from Rafelski et al.\n(2009) are only poisson and therefore have smaller error\nbars than those by Reddy & Steidel (2009). The points from\nReddy & Steidel (2009) are offset by 0.05 mag for clarity, and\ntheir uncertainties include both poisson and field to field variations. The number counts and the best-fit Schechter function\n(Schechter 1976) from Reddy & Steidel (2009) are converted\nto number of LBGs per half-magnitude bin using a similar\nconversion as in Reddy et al. (2008). Specifically, we use the\nR band as a tracer of rest-frame 1700 emission. The apparent\n\n\f4\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\nFigure 2. Thumbnail images in the V band of the 48 z \u223c 3 LBG subsample. The thumbnails are 2.4 arcsec on a side, the same size as the composite image in\nFigure 3, which corresponds to 18.5 kpc at z \u223c 3.\n\nmeasured R magnitude, RAB , is converted from the absolute\nmagnitude using the relation:\nRAB = MAB (1700) + 5log(dL /10pc) + 2.5log(1 + z) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere MAB (1700) is the absolute magnitude at the rest-frame\n1700, and dL is the luminosity distance. We apply the kcorrection from Rafelski et al. (2009) of RAB \u2212 VAB = \u22120.15\nmag to get the V band mag. We use a comoving volume\nof 26436 Mpc3 for the redshift interval 2.7< z <3.4 and\nan area of 11.56 arcmin2 for the number count conversion.\nWe adopt a Schechter function with parameters found by\n\u2217\nReddy & Steidel (2009) of \u03b1 = \u22121.73 \u00b1 0.13, MAB\n(1700) =\n\u2217\n\u22123\n\u22123\n\u221220.97 \u00b1 0.14, and \u03c6 = (1.71 \u00b1 0.53)\u00d710 Mpc .\nThe resultant number counts agree nicely, and show that the\ncompleteness of the Rafelski et al. (2009) z \u223c 3 LBG sample matches the previous completeness limit found of V \u223c 27\nmagnitude. The agreement also suggests that the comoving\nvolume for the redshift interval 2.7< z <3.4 is appropriate\nfor the sample, which is important for the argument given in\nSection 5. More importantly, the agreement of the number\ncounts allows us to use the best-fit Schechter function from\nReddy & Steidel (2009) to determine the expected number of\nLBGs at fainter magnitudes, providing the needed information to make completeness corrections in Appendix A. We\nnote that this luminosity function is valid to R \u223c 26.5, after\nwhich the extrapolation to fainter magnitudes could be a potential source of error, and we address this below.\n3.2. Catalogs of LBGs and Stars\nWe use two catalogs of z \u223c 3 LBGs in this paper. The\nfirst is the full sample of 407 z \u223c 3 LBGs as described in\nRafelski et al. (2009). The sample redshift distribution is\nshown in Figure 12 of Rafelski et al. (2009) and has a mean\nphotometric redshift of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3. The second (hereafter referred to as \"subset sample\") is a sample of z \u223c 3 LBGs selected to create a composite image to improve the signal-to-\n\nnoise of the surface brightness profile described below. These\nLBGs are selected to be compact, symmetric, and isolated,\nsimilar to the selection done at higher redshift by Hathi et al.\n(2008). The LBGs are selected to be compact and symmetric\nto aid in stacking LBGs of similar morphology and physical\ncharacteristics such that the bright central regions of the LBGs\noverlap. They were also selected to be isolated from nearby\nneighbors to avoid coincidental object overlap and dynamically disturbed objects.\nTo select objects that are compact, symmetric, and isolated, we measure morphological parameters in the V\nband image using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).\nWe experimented with different morphological parameters, such as asymmetry (Schade et al. 1995), concentration (Abraham et al. 1994, 1996), Gini coefficient (Lotz et al.\n2004), and clumpiness (Conselice 2003). However, we found\nthat the best sample was selected based on the FWHM for\ncompactness and ellipticity \u01eb = (1 \u2212 b/a) for symmetry, similar to the criteria in Hathi et al. (2008). Specifically, for the\nsubset sample, we require that FWHM \u2264 0.\u2032\u2032 25 and \u01eb \u2264 0.25,\na slightly more conservative selection than Hathi et al. (2008).\nLastly, to select isolated objects, we require that there are no\nother objects within 1.\u2032\u2032 4 brighter than 29th mag. These requirements yield a sample of 48 LBGs, representing \u223c 12%\nof the z \u223c 3 LBG sample, whose properties are compared in\nSection 3.3. We show this sample as thumbnails that are 2.4\narcsec on a side, which corresponds to 18.5 kpc at z \u223c 3, in\nFigure 2, and a table with relevant information about the 48\nLBGs in Table 1. Information on the full sample of 407 LBGs\nis available in Rafelski et al. (2009).\nIn addition to the two samples of LBGs, we also need\na sample of stars for an accurate measurement of the point\nspread function (PSF) of the UDF images. We obtain this star\nsample from Pirzkal et al. (2005), using only those stars with\nconfirmed grism spectra, which mostly consist of M dwarfs.\nWe exclude the stars that are saturated, leaving 15 stars in the\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\n\n5\n\nTable 1\nProperties of LBGs Included in Image Stack\nIDa\n\nzphot b\n\nV\n(mag)\n\nu \u2212V\n(mag)\n\nB \u2212V\n(mag)\n\nV \u2212 z\u2032\n(mag)\n\nFWHM\n(arcsec)\n\nEllipticity\n\n84\n862\n906\n1217\n1273\n1414\n1738\n1753\n2581\n2595\n\n3.11+0.40\n\u22120.40\n3.18+0.41\n\u22120.41\n2.68+0.36\n\u22120.36\n2.75+0.37\n\u22120.37\n3.03+0.39\n\u22120.39\n+0.38\n2.86\u22120.38\n2.67+0.36\n\u22120.36\n3.44+0.43\n\u22120.43\n3.40+0.43\n\u22120.43\n2.97+0.39\n\u22120.39\n\n26.56\u00b10.02\n27.16\u00b10.02\n27.52\u00b10.02\n26.53\u00b10.01\n26.24\u00b10.01\n27.19\u00b10.02\n26.27\u00b10.01\n27.47\u00b10.03\n26.92\u00b10.02\n27.37\u00b10.02\n\n2.40\u00b10.35\n1.87\u00b10.36\n1.50\u00b10.36\n2.28\u00b10.30\n2.79\u00b10.37\n1.82\u00b10.37\n1.05\u00b10.08\n1.02\u00b10.35\n2.05\u00b10.35\n1.60\u00b10.35\n\n0.70\u00b10.05\n0.74\u00b10.05\n-0.10\u00b10.04\n0.34\u00b10.02\n0.58\u00b10.03\n0.49\u00b10.06\n0.03\u00b10.02\n1.39\u00b10.14\n1.04\u00b10.07\n0.22\u00b10.04\n\n0.03\u00b10.04\n-0.44\u00b10.05\n-0.14\u00b10.05\n0.01\u00b10.02\n0.02\u00b10.02\n-0.03\u00b10.05\n-0.30\u00b10.03\n0.58\u00b10.04\n0.43\u00b10.03\n-0.17\u00b10.05\n\n0.24\n0.12\n0.10\n0.14\n0.12\n0.10\n0.16\n0.18\n0.18\n0.13\n\n0.18\n0.14\n0.04\n0.23\n0.12\n0.13\n0.15\n0.12\n0.24\n0.05\n\nNote. - V magnitudes are total AB magnitudes, and colors are isophotal colors. u band photometry is from\nRafelski et al.

We note that a comparison of\nthe star PSF with the LBGs shows that they are all resolved in\nthe high resolution ACS images.\n3.3. Comparison of the Subset and Full LBG Samples\nWe investigate whether the subset sample of 48 LBGs is\ndrawn from the same parent population of the full sample\nof 407 LBGs by comparing the magnitude, color, and redshifts of two the samples. First, we find little variation in the\nmagnitude distributions of the two samples, with a difference\nin the mean of \u223c 0.3 mag. The subset sample is somewhat\nfainter, with the full sample having an average AB magnitude\nof V = 26.4 \u00b1 0.9 and the subset sample with V = 26.7 \u00b1 0.6.\nThat is, there is a minor systematic selection of fainter LBGs\nin the subset sample, although this difference is not significant. The similar magnitude distribution of the rest-frame\nFUV flux suggests that the SFR of the two samples is similar.\nSecond, we compare the mean colors of the of the two samples and find the two samples have the same colors. We test\nthis both for the distribution and for stacks of the LBGs. First,\nthe mean of the distribution of the subset sample yields colors of B \u2212V = 0.5\u00b10.4, V \u2212 i\u2032 = 0.0\u00b10.2, and i\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032 =0.0\u00b10.1,\nwhile the full sample has colors of B \u2212 V = 0.6\u00b10.4, V \u2212 i\u2032 =\n0.1\u00b10.2, and i\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032 =0.0\u00b10.1. Second, the color of the stacked\nsubset sample based on aperture photometry has colors of\nB \u2212 V = 0.2\u00b10.2, V \u2212 i\u2032 = 0.1\u00b10.2, and i\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032 =0.1\u00b10.2, while\nthe full sample stack has colors of B \u2212 V = 0.3\u00b10.1, V \u2212 i\u2032 =\n0.1\u00b10.1, and i\u2032 \u2212 z\u2032 =0.2\u00b10.1. These colors are not significantly different based on both the distribution and the stacked\nphotometry uncertainties. The similar distribution of colors\nsuggests that the two samples are made of the same stellar\npopulations and that their star formation histories (SFHs) are\nsimilar.\nLastly, the two samples have very similar redshift distributions, with the same mean redshift of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3. We therefore\nconclude that the subset sample and full sample of LBGs are\nequivalent in magnitude, color, and redshift, and therefore are\nprobably drawn from the same parent population of LBGs that\nhave similar SFRs, stellar populations, and SFHs. Hence, we\nare relatively confident that the results determined below for\nthe subset sample of LBGs are applicable to the full sample.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we also consider stacking the\nfull stack of LBGs in Appendix B. We note that stacking the\nfull sample introduces contamination into the stack, such as\nnearby galaxies. In addition, bright parts of morphologically\ndifferent galaxies contribute to the faint parts of other galaxies. We therefore do not use this as our primary stack, and\ntake the full stack as an upper limit to the emission from the\nfull sample of LBGs.\n4. ANALYSIS OF UDF IMAGES\nThe V band image of the UDF is the most sensitive high\nresolution image covering the rest-frame FUV at z \u223c 3 available. However, even this image does not reach the desired\nsensitivity to search for spatially extended star formation on\nscales up to \u223c10 kpc (as shown below). We wish to increase the S/N high enough to probe down to low values of\nthe SFR surface density (\u03a3SFR ). Image stacking methods can\nbe used to study the average properties of well defined samples in which individual objects do not have the necessary S/N\n(e.g., Pascarelle et al. 1996; Zibetti et al. 2004, 2005, 2007;\nHathi et al. 2008).\nWe therefore create super-stacks of the LBG images in Section 4.1 and investigate how the sky-subtraction uncertainty\naffects those stacks in Section 4.2. Using the super-stack of\nthe subset sample of LBGs described in Section 3.2, we determine the radial surface brightness profile of z \u223c 3 LBGs\nin Section 4.3, which will be used for much of the analysis\nthroughout the paper. Lastly, in Section 4.4, we investigate\nthe effects of the Ly\u03b1 line on the stacked image.\n\n4.1. Image Stacks\nWe create stacked composite images for the LBG subset\nsample, full LBG sample, and stars sample using custom IDL\ncode. For each object, we fit a two-dimensional Gaussian using MPFIT (Markwardt 2009) to determine a robust center.\nWe then shift each object to be centered with sub-pixel resolution, interpolating with a damped sinc function. We then\ncreate thumbnail images for each object and combine all the\nobjects by taking the median of all the thumbnails, yielding a\nrobust stacked image which is not sensitive to outliers. While\nsome of the individual thumbnails may have faint emission\nregions below the level of the isolation criteria, they do not\n\n\f6\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\ncertainties, and this would therefore not alter our results.\n\nFigure 3. Composite image in the V band of the 48 z \u223c 3 LBG subsample.\nEach stamp is 2.4 arcsec on a side, which corresponds to 18.5 kpc at z \u223c 3.\n\ncontribute to the median because such emission would need\nto occur at the same pixels for a significant number objects\nto affect the median. Therefore, independent of the origin of\nany such faint regions, they do not affect their median, and\ntherefore do not affect the final stack. While we are most interested in the V band, we also carry out this procedure for the\nB, V , i\u2032 , and z\u2032 bands and the stars sample. Figure 3 shows the\nstacked V band image, as this corresponds to the rest-frame\nFUV luminosity at z \u223c 3 which is a sensitive measure of the\nSFR. The image is 2.4 arcsec on a side, which corresponds to\n18.5 kpc at z \u223c 3.\nWe showed in Section 3.3 that the subset sample is representative of the full LBG sample and here investigate any\npossible variations in the radial surface brightness profile with\nmagnitude and FWHM within the subsample itself. We check\nif these parameters affect the stack by creating three independent stacks of different brightnesses or FWHM. In the case of\nmagnitude, we create one stack of the brightest 16 LBGs, a\nsecond stack of the next 16 LBGs, and a third stack with the\nfaintest 16 LBGs, and repeat for FWHM. We find the profiles\nto be very similar and find that the magnitude and FWHM\nrange does not affect our stack. We also investigate the change\nin the surface brightness profile color. We find that the variations of the LBG composite images for the B, V , i\u2032 , and z\u2032\nbands across radius are small compared to their uncertainties,\nand no clear change in color is obvious at any radius.\nWe also test the difference between taking the median and\nthe mean of the images in our stack. The profiles of the mean\nstack are slightly higher at the bright end, but are very similar\nto the median stack starting at \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 3. We chose to go with the\nmedian as it is more robust to possible contamination in the\noutskirts. In this way, we are not sensitive to contamination if\nit only occurs in a small subset of our sample.\nIn creating a stack of the star data to measure the PSF, we\nscale each star to the peak of the fitted two-dimensional Gaussian before stacking. For the PSF, we only care about the\nshape of the PSF, and not the actual value of the flux. Given\nthe wide distribution of magnitudes of the stars, this scaling\nimproves the PSF determination. We do not scale the LBGs\nbefore stacking, as we care about the actual measured flux in\nthe outskirts of the LBGs. We find that scaling does not have\na significant effect on the LBG stack due to the small range\nin brightnesses of the selected LBGs, with the radial surface\nbrightness of the two stacks being consistent within the un-\n\n4.2. Sky-subtraction Uncertainty\nWe hope to accurately characterize the sky background\nand the uncertainties due to the subtraction of this sky background. The sky-subtraction uncertainty of the UDF was\ncarefully investigated by Hathi et al. (2008), and we follow\ntheir prescription for determining the 1\u03c3 sky-subtraction error. Hathi et al. (2008) found that it was more reliable to\ncharacterize the sky locally rather than globally for the entire image. For this reason, we redetermine the local sky\nbackground for the 407 z \u223c 3 LBGs in our sample. First,\nwe measure the sky background in each of the thumbnail\nimages of the full LBG sample using IDL and the procedure MMM.pro7, adapted from the DAOPHOT routine by the\nsame name (Stetson 1987). This procedure iteratively determines the background, removing low probability outliers\neach time, until the sky background is determined. We then\nfind the 1\u03c3 sky value by fitting a Gaussian to the distribution of sky values. For the V band, this gives us a value for\n\u03c3sky,ran of 3.52 \u00d7 10\u22125 electrons s\u22121 , very similar to that found\nby Hathi et al. (2008) of 3.55 \u00d7 10\u22125 electrons s\u22121 . Using this\nnumber and the formalism in Hathi et al. (2008), we find a 1\u03c3\nsky-subtraction error of 30.01 mag arcsec\u22122 .\nIf the error is random, the uncertainty of the sky-subtraction\nwill decrease as we stack more images together. In fact, for\na median\n\u221a stack in the Poisson limit, the 1\u03c3 uncertainty is\n1.25/ N, where N is the number of images. We test this\nrelation specifically for the UDF data as the error may not\nbe completely random. We stack 48 blank thumbnails and\ncompare the standard deviation of stacked pixels to the median of the standard deviations of each individual thumbnail\nand find the above relation holds to 99% accuracy. We are\ntherefore confident that the sky-subtraction noise decreases\nwith stacking as expected, yielding larger S/N values. For the\nstack of 48 LBGs from our subset sample, we find a 1\u03c3 skysubtraction error of 31.87 mag arcsec\u22122 . We use both of these\nsky-subtraction errors as our sky limits below in Section 4.3.\n4.3. Radial Surface Brightness Profile\nWe extract a radial surface brightness profile from the\nsuper-stack of LBG images in Figure 4 using custom IDL\ncode which yields identical results to the IRAF8 procedure\nELLIPSE. We use circular aperture rings with radial widths\nof 1.5 pixels in such a way that they do not overlap to avoid\ncorrelated data points while still finely probing the profile.\nWe use custom code in order to facilitate using the bootstrap\nerror analysis method to determine the uncertainties. Since\nwe are stacking different objects with different characteristics, the uncertainty for the brighter regions will be dominated\nby the sample variance, and can be determined with the bootstrap method. Specifically, we bootstrap to get the uncertainty\nof the median of the LBGs by replacing a random fraction\n(1/e \u2248 37%) of the 48 LBG thumbnails with randomly duplicated thumbnails from the subset sample. We repeat this\n1000 times to get a sample of composite images using the\nmethod described in Section 4.1, each with its own radial surface brightness profile. The resultant uncertainty is then the\n7\n\nPart of the IDL Astronomy User's Library\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory,\nwhich is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n8\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\nRadius [kpc]\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n\n8\n\nMedian LBGs\nPSF\nSersic Fit\n1 Image Sky Limit\n48 Image Sky Limit\n\n24\n\n0\n\nLog \u03a3SFR [M\u039f\u2022 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122]\n\nSurface Brightness (\u03bcV) [mag arcsec\u22122]\n\n0\n22\n\n\u22121\n\n26\n\n28\n\n\u22122\n\n30\n\n\u22123\n32\n34\n0.0\n\n\u22124\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.8\nRadius [arcsec]\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nFigure 4.

This method is conservative, but includes all\nthe uncertainties associated with the variance of the sample.\nMoreover, it helps takes into account possible errors introduced by possible contamination of our LBG sample by other\nobjects, although as mentioned in Section 3, we believe this\ncontamination fraction to be small.\nThe solid blue line in Figure 4 represents the measured ACS\nV band PSF determined from a stacked image of the 15 stars\ndescribed in Section 3.2. The central surface brightness of the\nstars is scaled to match the LBGs. We note that the S/N of the\nstar stack is higher than that of the LBG stack, even though it\nhas a smaller number of objects in the stack, because the stars\nare brighter than the LBGs. Therefore the PSF is well determined, and we expect the uncertainties are dominated by the\nlower S/N LBG stack. The PSF declines more rapidly than\nthe radial surface brightness profile at all radii, which shows\nthat the LBGs are clearly resolved and that the median surface brightness profile of the LBGs is extended. The dashed\nline is the 1\u03c3 sky-subtraction error for one thumbnail image,\nwhile the dash-dotted line is the 1\u03c3 sky-subtraction error for\nthe composite stack of 48 LBGs, as described in Section 4.2.\n4.3.1. S\u00e9rsic Profile Fit\nThe dotted red line in Figure 4 shows the best fit S\u00e9rsic profile convolved with the ACS V band PSF. We fit for\nthe best S\u00e9rsic model to the composite LBG image by using\nthe Levenberg\u2013Marquardt least-squares minimization, with\nthe \u03c72 calculated on a pixel by pixel basis for each possible model. The best fit values are n = 1.9 \u00b1 0.04 and\nRe = 0.074 \u00b1 0.001 arcsec, where n is the S\u00e9rsic index and\nRe is the effective radius, which includes half the light of\nthe LBGs. We use the dimensionless scale factor b(n) from\nCiotti & Bertin (1999) such that Re is the half-light radius.\nThe small Re value is likely due to our pre-selection of LBGs\nto be compact (see Section 3.2). While the fit has a good reduced chi-square \u03c72 /\u03bd of 1.27, it is not a very good fit to the\ndata in the outer regions. The fit is dominated by the inner\npart of the profile with radii less than \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 4, since the uncertainties are significantly smaller in that region. For radii larger\nthan \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 4, the profile deviates from the inner best-fit profile.\n\n7\n\nThis deviation is real, being above the PSF and the 1\u03c3 skysubtraction error. This is similar to what Hathi et al. (2008)\nfound when stacking LBGs at z \u223c 4 \u2212 \u22126. The main constraint\nwe have from this is that it suggests that the profile is similar\nto an exponential disk type profile. If we fit an exponential, it\nyields a worse fit with a \u03c72 /\u03bd of 1.4, and Re = 0.068 \u00b1 0.001\narcsec. A bulge-disk model yields a slightly better fit in the\nouter regions, but does not improve the overall \u03c72 /\u03bd. We note\nthat we do not use the fit in the analysis below.\n4.4. Effects of the Ly\u03b1 Line on the Image Stack\nWe investigate possible contamination from Ly\u03b1 emission\non the image stack to ensure that the radial surface brightness\nprofile is unaffected by Ly\u03b1 emission from the LBGs. First,\nwe note that Ly\u03b1 only enters our V band filter for about half\nour sample due to the redshift range sampled. Second, we find\nthat due to the large width of the V band filter, the Ly\u03b1 line\nwould have a very small effect. This is determined by taking the stacked LBG spectrum from Shapley et al. (2003), and\ncomparing the flux in the V band filter with and without the\nLy\u03b1 line. We find that the inclusion of the Ly\u03b1 line yields an\nincrease of 0.02 mag, a very small effect compared to our uncertainties. While our sample of LBGs is significantly fainter\nthan the LBGs in the stacked spectrum from Shapley et al.\n(2003), we expect the average strength of the Ly\u03b1 line to be\nsimilar due to the low escape fraction of ionizing radiation\nfrom LBGs (Shapley et al. 2006).\nMoreover, we compare the radial surface brightness profile\nof the V band stack and an equivalent stack in the i\u2032 band. The\nLy\u03b1 line does not enter the i\u2032 band filter throughout our redshift range, making the i\u2032 band an excellent test to check if the\nradial surface brightness profile is affected by the Ly\u03b1 line.\nWe find that the V and i\u2032 bands have the same radial surface\nbrightness profile within their uncertainties, with no systematic shifts. This suggests that the Ly\u03b1 line has little to no\neffect, even if the Ly\u03b1 line were more extended than the continuum.\n5. DIRECT INFERENCES FROM THE DATA\n\nThe surface brightness profile of the stacked image indicates the presence of spatially extended star formation around\nLBGs. In this section, we describe how to connect this emission, which corresponds to the rest-frame FUV radiation intensity, to the SFR surface density. We then compare the\ncovering fraction of this emission to that of the gas responsible for the star formation in Section 5.2. Specifically, in\norder to determine what types of gas can be responsible for\nthe observed emission, we compare its covering fraction to\nthat of atomic-dominated gas in Section 5.2.1 and to that of\nmolecular-dominated gas in Section 5.2.2. Then in Section\n5.3 and 5.4, we calculate the in situ SFR, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , and metal production based on the integrated flux measured in the outskirts\nof LBGs.\n5.1. Connecting the Observed Intensity to the SFR Surface\nDensity\nIn order to investigate how the measured star formation relates to the underlying gas, we require a relation between star\nformation and gas properties. Star formation occurs in the\npresence of cold atomic and/or molecular gas, according to\nthe KS relation given by\n\u0013\u03b2\n\u0012\n\u03a3gas\n.\n(2)\n\u03a3SFR = K \u00d7\n\u03a3c\n\n\f8\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\nThis relation holds for nearby disk galaxies in which \u03a3gas is\nthe mass surface density perpendicular to the plane of the disk,\n\u03a3c = 1M\u2299 pc\u22122 , K = KKenn =(2.5\u00b10.5)\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 ,\nand \u03b2=1.4\u00b10.15 (Kennicutt 1998a,b). There has been\nmuch recent work on improving both our understanding of\nthis relation, and measuring the values of K and \u03b2 (e.g.,\nLeroy et al. 2008; Bigiel et al. 2008; Krumholz et al. 2009b;\nGnedin & Kravtsov 2010; Genzel et al. 2010; Bigiel et al.\n2010b). When only considering molecular gas, the relationship has a flatter slope of \u03b2=0.96\u00b10.07 (Bigiel et al. 2008)\nor \u03b2 \u223c 1.1 (Wong & Blitz 2002). We use the original values\nfrom (Kennicutt 1998a) when considering the total gas density to simplify comparisons with other work, and \u03b2=1.0 and\nK=KBiegel =(8.7\u00b11.5)\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 when considering\nonly molecular gas. We note that the K value given here used\nfor molecular gas is modified from Bigiel et al. (2008) to use\nthe same \u03a3c = 1 M\u2299 pc\u22122 value as above.\nRewriting the KS relation in terms of the column density of\nthe gas, we get\n\u03a3SFR = K \u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\nN\nNc\n\n\u0013\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the scale factor Nc =1.25\u00d71020 cm\u22122 (Kennicutt\n1998a,b) and N is the hydrogen column density.9 We note\nthat this is only valid above the critical column density, which\nis usually associated with the threshold condition for Toomre\ninstability. For H I gas in local galaxies, it is observed to range\nbetween 5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 and 2\u00d71021 cm\u22122 (Kennicutt 1998b).\nIn order to connect \u03a3SFR to the observations, we require\na relation between observed intensity, corresponding to restframe FUV emission, and observed column density, N. Following Wolfe & Chen (2006, equation (3)), we find that for a\nfixed value of N, the intensity averaged over all disk inclination angles is given by\ni=\nhI\u03bdobs\n0\n\nC\u03a3SFR\n,\n4\u03c0(1 + z)3\u03b2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere z is the redshift, and C is the conversion factor from SFR to FUV (\u03bb \u223c 1500) radiation, with C =\n8.4 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 (M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 )\u22121 (Madau et al.\n1998; Kennicutt 1998b). We use the same value of C as\nWolfe & Chen (2006) corresponding to a Salpeter IMF. The\nresult in Equation (4) assumes that the star formation occurs\nin disks inclined on the plane of the sky by randomly selected\ninclination angles and averages over all possible angles (see\nWolfe & Chen 2006).\n5.2. Covering Fraction of LBGs Compared to the\nUnderlying Gas\nThe covering fraction of observed star formation should be\nconsistent with that of its underlying gas. We therefore investigate whether the covering fraction of the outer parts of LBGs\nis consistent with the covering fraction of atomic-dominated\ngas in Section 5.2.1 and molecular-dominated gas in Section\n5.2.2. This consistency check yields insights into the nature of\nthe observed star formation and validates the hypothesis that\n9 The reader should be aware that when referring to nearby galaxies, N corresponds to N\u22a5 , the H I column density perpendicular to the disk, but when\nwriting about our observations, we are referring to observed column densities\nN, where we implicitly include the inclination angles in our definitions.\n\nthe outskirts of LBGs consist of atomic-dominated gas, which\nis used in subsequent sections of the paper.\nWe calculate the cumulative covering fraction, CA , for gas\ncolumns greater than some column density, N, by integrating\nthe H column-density distribution function f (NH , X), where H\nis either H Ior H2 . Specifically,\nZ Xmax Z Nmax\ndNH f (NH , X) ,\n(5)\ndX\nCA (N) =\nXmin\n\nN\n\nwhere f (NH , X) is the observed column-density distribution\nfunction of the hydrogen gas, Nmax is the maximum columndensity considered, and X is the absorption distance with dX\nbeing defined as\ndX \u2261\n\nH0\n(1 + z)2dz ,\nH(z)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere H0 is the Hubble constant and H(z) is the Hubble parameter at redshift z. For Xmin and Xmax we use the same redshift interval as in Section 3.1, namely 2.7 < z < 3.4 corresponding to 6.6 < X < 9.2. The covering fraction depends\nstrongly on the column-density distribution function, which\nis different for atomic and molecular gas. Below we investigate the covering fraction for both cases.\n5.2.1. Covering Fraction of Atomic-dominated Gas\nThere is strong evidence to support the association of LBGs\nand neutral atomic-dominated H I gas, i.e., DLAs (see Section\n1), and we therefore investigate whether the covering fraction\nof the outer parts of LBGs is consistent with the covering fraction of DLAs. If the outer regions of LBGs truly consist of\nDLA gas, then the covering fractions as functions of the surface brightnesses should be consistent. In this subsection, we\nwork under the hypothesis that the observed FUV emission in\nthe outskirts of LBGs is from in situ star formation in atomicdominated gas and compare the observed covering fraction to\nthat of the gas distribution.\nIn order to calculate the covering fraction using Equation\n(5), we require f (NH , X) for atomic-dominated gas. The observed H I column-density distribution function, f (NHI , X), is\nobtained by a double power-law fit to the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey data:\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\nN\nf (NHI , X) = k3\n,\n(7)\nN0\n\nwhere k3 =(1.12\u00b10.05)\u00d710\u221224 cm2 , \u03b1=\u03b13 =\u22122.00\u00b10.05 for\nN \u2264 N0 10 and \u03b1=\u03b14 =\u22123.0 for N > N0 , where N0 = 3.54+0.34\n\u22120.24 \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 (Prochaska et al. 2005; Prochaska & Wolfe 2009).\nThe value of \u03b14 used is different than measured in\n(Prochaska & Wolfe 2009), to remain consistent with our formulation of randomly oriented disks in Section 6, and is predicted to be \u22123.0, and we use this value for the covering fraction to be consistent. Although this value of \u03b14 is different\nthan the value in Prochaska & Wolfe (2009), the uncertainties are quite large due to low numbers of very high column\ndensity DLAs, and it is quite similar to the value found by\nNoterdaeme et al. (2009) of \u03b14 =\u22123.48.\nWe note that Noterdaeme et al. (2009) find slightly different values for k3 and \u03b13 than Prochaska & Wolfe (2009),\n10 We follow Wolfe & Chen (2006) who equated N with N , the break in\n0\nd\nthe double power-law expression for f (NHI , X).\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\n22.5\n\nLog N [cm\u22122] with K=0.1\u00d7KKenn\n22.0\n21.5\n\n21.0\n\n\u22121.0\nLBG outskirts\nCorrected LBG outskirts\nDLAs with K=Kkenn\nDLAs with K=0.1\u00d7Kkenn\nDLAs with K=0.02\u00d7Kkenn\n\nLog Covering Fraction\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22122.0\n\n\u22122.5\n\n\u22123.0\n26\n\n27\n28\n29\n30\nSurface Brightness (\u03bcV) [mag arcsec\u22122]\n\n31\n\n32\n\nFigure 5.

The solid black line\nis the covering fraction for the LBG outskirts, while the gold long-dashed line\nis the same corrected for completeness.

We use the values from\nProchaska & Wolfe (2009) and describe how the differing values affect our results below. Also, although the normalization\nof f (NHI , X) varies with redshift, the variations for our redshift interval are not large and do not strongly affect CA . Using the Prochaska & Wolfe (2009) values for f (NHI , X), and\nNmax = 1022 cm\u22122 , we calculate the covering fraction using\nEquation (5) and the corresponding expected \u03bcV from Equai \u2212 Z, and Z is the\ntions (3) and (4), where \u03bcV = \u22122.5loghI\u03bdobs\n0\nAB magnitude zero point of 26.486.\nWe compare the cumulative covering fraction of DLAs to\nthe observed covering fraction of the outer regions of the\nLBGs in Figure 5. The blue dotted line is the DLA covering\nfraction for DLAs forming stars according to the KS relation,\nwith K = KKenn . The red lines are for less efficient star formation where the dash-dotted line represents K = 0.1 \u00d7 KKenn and\nthe triple-dott-dashed line represents K = 0.02 \u00d7 KKenn . The\nblack line is the covering fraction for the observed emission\nin the outskirts of LBGs in the UDF, which is just the area\ncovered by the outskirts of LBGs up to \u03bcV divided by the total area probed, 11.56 arcmin2 . The covered area is obtained\nfrom the radial surface brightness profile and the 407 observed\nLBGs in this area. The observed covering fraction depends on\nthe depth of the images and therefore requires a completeness\ncorrection for faint objects that are missed: we discuss this\ncompleteness correction in Appendix A. The completeness\ncorrected covering fraction for LBGs is the dashed gold longdashed line, and is the curve that we compare to the DLA lines\nbelow. We ignore the data at a radius > 0.8 arcsec (\u223c 6kpc) to\nonly include data with S/N>3, however, we expect a continuation of the observed trends. We note that we are only sampling the top end of the DLA distribution function, and therefore the covering fraction shown is a small fraction (about\na tenth) of the total covering fraction of DLAs. When considering all DLAs, we cover about one-third of the sky, i.e.,\nlog(CA ) \u223c \u22120.5. We note that if we use the Noterdaeme et al.\n\n9\n\n(2009) values for f (NHI , X), then the DLA lines move up and\nto the left (i.e., cover more of the sky).\nUnder the hypothesis that the outskirts of LBGs are comprised of atomic-dominated gas (i.e., DLAs) which is responsible for the observed emission, then we expect the covering\nfraction of the DLA gas to be equal to the covering fraction of\nthe outskirts of LBGs. The blue dotted line for DLAs following the KS relation would therefore only be consistent\nwith the covering fraction of the outskirts of LBGs if much of\nthe DLA gas is not surrounding LBGs. This possibility was\nconstrained by (Wolfe & Chen 2006), who found that DLAs\nwould need to be forming at significantly lower SFR efficiencies if this was the case. On the other hand, we find that the\ncovering fraction of the outskirts of LBGs is consistent with\nDLAs having SFR efficiencies of K & 0.1 \u00d7 KKenn, at which\npoint the covering fraction is roughly equal. This coveringfactor analysis provides evidence that if the outskirts of LBGs\nare comprised of DLA gas, then the SFR efficiency of this\natomic-dominated gas at z \u223c 3 is about 10% of the efficiency\nfor local galaxies.\nMoreover, the cumulative covering fraction shows that\nthere is sufficient DLA gas available to be responsible for the\nemission in the outskirts of LBGs for SFR efficiencies & 10%.\nWe investigate this lower SFR efficiency further in Section 6,\nwhere we find an efficiency closer to 5%, which is only a factor of \u223c2 different than the efficiency determined from the\ncovering fraction. We note that systematic uncertainties due\nto assumptions throughout both quantities could easily be off\nby a factor of two, and so the general agreement of the covering fraction at low SFR efficiencies is reassuring, and we are\nnot concerned about the minor disagreement.\n5.2.2. Covering Fraction of Molecular Gas\nIn the previous subsection, we worked under the hypothesis that the observed FUV emission in the outskirts of LBGs\nis from in situ star formation in atomic-dominated gas. However, it is possible that this star formation occurs in moleculardominated gas. We consider this scenario here, and compare\nthe covering fraction of molecular-dominated gas, where the\nmajority of the hydrogen gas is molecular, to our observations.\nIn order to calculate the covering fraction using Equation\n(5), we require f (NH , X) for molecular-dominated gas. We\nuse the observed molecular column-density distribution function, f (NH2 ), from Zwaan & Prochaska (2006), who obtained\na lognormal fit to the BIMA SONG data (Helfer et al. 2003),\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 #\nlogN\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n/2 ,\n(8)\nf (NH2 ) = f \u2217 exp\n\u03c3\nwhere \u03bc = 20.6, \u03c3 = 0.65, and the normalization f \u2217 is 1.1 \u00d7\n10\u221225 cm2 (Zwaan & Prochaska 2006)11 . We use the molecular version of the KS relation discussed in Section 5, where\n\u03b2=1.0 and K=KBiegel =8.7\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 , and we let\nNmax = 1024 cm\u22122 , the largest observed value for the f (NH2 )\nfunction used (Zwaan & Prochaska 2006). However, f (NH2 )\nis not observationally determined at z \u223c 3, and likely evolves\nover time, and we investigate such a possibility below.\nThe evolution of f (NH2 ) would either be due to a change\nin the normalization or a change in the shape.

Cumulative covering fraction of gas with columns greater than\nsome column density N (and therefore surface brightness). This figure is similar to Figure 5, but makes comparisons to the covering fractions of molecular gas rather than atomic-dominated gas. The solid black line is the covering\nfraction for LBGs starting from the center of the LBG core, and the gold longdashed line is the same corrected for completeness. The purple short-dashed\nline is the covering fraction of molecular hydrogen with no evolution at z \u223c 3,\nthe pink triple dot-dashed line is the same with an evolution of four times f \u2217\n(the normalization of the column-density distribution function of molecular\ngas) and the cyan dot-dashed line is the same with an evolution of 10 times\nf \u2217 . The gray lines continuing the purple, pink, and cyan lines are extrapolations of the data to lower column densities. The gray filled region represents\nthe transition region mentioned in Section 5.2.2. The top x-axis coordinates\nare the column densities corresponding to the surface brightnesses using an\nefficiency of K = KBiegel and \u03b2 = 1, valid for molecular gas.\n\nthe atomic gas column-density distribution function, f (NHI ),\nhas not evolved between z = 0 and z = 3 (Zwaan et al. 2005;\nProchaska et al. 2005; Prochaska & Wolfe 2009), but the normalization has increased by a factor of two.

While theoretical models predict that \u03a9H2 (z =\n3)/\u03a9H2 (z = 0) is \u223c 4, their similar prediction for atomic gas\ndoes not match observations (Obreschkow & Rawlings 2009).\nAlternatively, we can determine an upper limit of the evolution of f \u2217 using the evolution of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 for galaxies between\nz = 0 and z = 3, assuming that the evolution in f (NH2 ) is only\ndue to the normalization, and there is no evolution in the KS\nlaw for molecular gas between z = 0 and z = 3 (Bouch\u00e9 et al.\n2007; Daddi et al. 2010; Genzel et al. 2010, see Section 6.3).\nSpecifically, studies have found that \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (z = 3)/\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (z = 0) \u223c 10\n(Schiminovich et al. 2005; Reddy et al. 2008), and therefore\nf \u2217 changes at most by a factor of 10, if we assume that the\ncontribution from atomic gas is small. This is used as an upper limit to the evolution of f \u2217 , and we are not suggesting that\nthis is the correct evolution.\nWe plot the covering fractions of molecular gas at z =\n3 in Figure 6. We consider three cases for f (NH2 ): (1)\nno evolution as a purple short-dashed line, (2) evolution\nwith a factor of four increase in f \u2217 based on the model by\nObreschkow & Rawlings (2009) as a pink triple-dashed line,\nand (3) evolution with a factor of 10 increase in f \u2217 based on\nthe observed evolution in \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 as a cyan dot-dashed line. The\ngray lines continuing these three lines are extrapolations of\nthe data to lower column densities than observed. We note\nthat the column densities on the top x-axis of the plot now are\nfor K = KBiegel .\nThese covering fractions of molecular gas are compared to\nthe LBG profile including the inner cores in Figure 6. The\n\nLBG covering fraction is now modified to include the LBG\ncores which are composed of molecular-dominated gas, and\nthe new LBG covering fraction is plotted as a solid brown line.\nWe again ignore the data at a radius > 0.8 arcsec (\u223c 6kpc) to\nonly include data with S/N>3. This covering fraction is also\ncorrected for completeness similar to Section 5.2.1, except\nthis time we include the cores of the LBGs and make no distinction between the outskirts and the inner parts of the LBGs,\nand is described in Appendix A.1. We plot this corrected covering fraction as a gold long-dashed line. This correction is\nquite large, as even though the cores cover a smaller area than\nthe outskirts, the cores of fainter missed LBGs contribute at\nevery surface brightness as we go fainter. Since there are significantly more faint LBGs than bright LBGs, there are significantly more LBG cores contributing to each surface brightness than there are LBGs with outskirts at those same surface\nbrightnesses. This correction assumes that all the star formation comes from molecular-dominated gas, and therefore all\nthe cores of fainter LBGs are included.\nAs in Section 5.2.1, we expect the covering fraction of the\ngas to be equal to the covering fraction of the LBGs forming\nout of that gas. In the case of purely molecular gas, the upper\nlimit of the covering fraction (10 \u00d7 f \u2217) of the gas is only consistent to \u03bcV \u223c 28.5. At \u03bcV & 28.5, the covering fraction of\nLBGs is larger than that of the molecular gas. In order to have\na covering fraction larger than all the corrected LBG emission, we would require an evolution of f \u2217 by a factor of more\nthan 60, which is not very likely.\nWe have just shown that the predicted covering factor for\nmolecules is inconsistent with our results for \u03bcV & 28.5. At\nthe same time, our results for atomic-dominated hydrogen\ndo not apply for \u03bcV brighter than \u223c 29, due to the atomicdominated H I gas cutoff of NHI \u2264 1022 cm\u22122 . Therefore, the\nsurface brightness interval from 28.5 . \u03bcV . 29.2 is not simultaneously consistent with the neutral atomic-dominated\ngas nor the molecular gas' covering fractions. This lower\nbound on \u03bcV is based on comparing the LBG data compared\nto 10 times f \u2217 , and for lower evolutions of f \u2217 , this begins\nat even brighter \u03bcV . This result is reasonable if the LBG\noutskirts consist of atomic-dominated gas. In this scenario,\nthere would need to be a transition region between atomicdominated and molecular-dominated gas, where star formation occurs in both phases. We note that in this hybrid region, the corrected covering fraction of LBGs is not correct, as we would be adding the star formation in the cores\nof missed LBGs to the outskirts presumably composed of\natomic-dominated gas. The true correction would lie somewhere between the black solid line and the gold long-dashed\nline. We take the molecular gas covering fraction results\nas evidence that the outskirts of LBGs consist of atomicdominated gas, which is consistent with our underlying hypothesis for this paper.\n5.3. Measurements of the SFR and \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 in the Outskirts of\nLBGs\nIn addition to calculating the efficiency of the SFR, we can\nalso calculate the mean SFR, hSFRi, and \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 in the outskirts\nof LBGs by integrating the rest-frame FUV emission in the\nouter areas. These measurements allow us to calculate the\nmetals produced in the outskirts of LBGs in Section 5.4 and\nto put a limit on the total \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 contributed by DLA gas. Similar\nto Wolfe & Chen (2006), we assume that DLAs are disk like\nstructures, or any other type of gaseous configurations with\npreferred planes of symmetry.

Even if the outskirts of LBGs are not DLA gas, such an\nassumption is still valid given the rotation curves measured\nfor high redshift LBGs (e.g., Schreiber et al. 2009) and the\npredictions by simulations (Brooks et al. 2009; Ceverino et al.\n2010).\nFor these calculations, we need \u03a3\u22a5\n\u03bd , the luminosity per unit\nfrequency interval per unit area projected perpendicular to the\nplane of the disk. Specifically, we solve for \u03a3\u22a5\n\u03bd as a function\ni averaged over all inclination angles. We find that\nof hI\u03bdobs\n0\n\u03a3\u22a5\n\u03bd \u2261\n\ni\n4\u03c0(1 + z)3hI\u03bdobs\n0\n,\nln(R/H)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere R is the radius and H is the scale height of the model\ndisks, which holds in the limit R \u226b H.

We then calculate the mean SFR\nby integrating \u03a3\u22a5\n\u03bd across the outer region of the LBG stack,\nand find that\nhSFRi =\n\n8\u03c0(1 + z)3\nC\u2032 ln(R/H)\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8high\n\n\u03b8low\n\n(\u03b8)i\u03b8d\u03b8 ,\n2\u03c0dA 2 hI\u03bdobs\n0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere dA is the angular diameter distance, \u03b8 is the radius in\narcseconds, \u03b8low is the minimum radius for the outer region,\n(\u03b8) comes from the radial\nand \u03b8high is the maximum radius.

The hSFRi is independent of the theoretical framework developed later in Section 6\nand does not depend on the efficiency of the gas. It is purely a\nmeasurement of the star formation occurring in the gas. However, it requires a minimum radius to define the beginning of\nthe outer region of the LBGs. Specifically, we pick the smallest radius that corresponds to the first point in Figure 9 where\nwe demonstrate that the smallest radius of atomic-dominated\ngas corresponds to 0.\u2032\u2032 4.12 We note that when we refer to spa12\n\nThis corresponds to \u03bcV = 28.8 \u00b1 0.2 mag arcsec\u22122 , or \u03a3SFR = (6 \u00b1 1) \u00d7\n\ntially extended emission star formation throughout the paper,\nwe are referring to emission at radii larger than 0.\u2032\u2032 4. We also\nrequire a second point that we integrate out to, for which we\nuse two different values. First, we use the radius of 0.\u2032\u2032 813 ,\nwhich corresponds to the largest radius above 3\u03c3. Second,\nwe integrate to 1.\u2032\u2032 1 14 , corresponding to the furthest point for\nwhich we measured \u03bcV in Figure 4. Table 2 lists the SFRs for\ndifferent combinations of R/H and \u03b8high . Since we integrate\nover the radii where the LBG data intersect the theoretical\nmodels for the DLA gas, the FUV emission from this region\nmay be from the in situ star formation in DLA gas associated\nwith the LBGs (see Section 7).\nAfter we have the SFR we can calculate values for the SFR\nper unit comoving volume, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , via \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 =SFR\u00d7NLBG /VUDF , and\nthey are tabulated in Table 2. However, since \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 depends on\nNLBG , we perform a completeness correction as described in\nAppendix A.2. The resultant completeness corrected \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 are\nlisted in Table 2. While there is a range in the acceptable\nvalues for both the SFR and \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , we find that the extended\nemission has hSFRi \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 .\nWe take this measured \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 in conjunction with the upper\nlimit found in Wolfe & Chen (2006) to calculate the total\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 from neutral atomic-dominated gas at z \u223c 3. Specifically, Wolfe & Chen (2006) constrain \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 for regions in the\nUDF without LBGs, which complements the results from this\nstudy for regions containing such objects. Together, we constrain all possibilities for the star formation from such gas.\nWolfe & Chen (2006) place a conservative upper limit on\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 contributed by DLAs with column densities greater than\nNmin = 2 \u00d7 1020cm\u22122 , finding \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 < 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 .\nCombining this with our largest possible value of the completeness corrected \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 in Table 2 of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 =5.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nMpc\u22123 , we calculate an upper limit on the total \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 contributed\nby DLA gas. We find a conservative upper limit of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 <\n9.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 , corresponding to \u223c 10% of the \u03c1 \u0307\u2217\nmeasured in the inner regions of LBGs at z \u223c 3 (Reddy et al.\n2008).\n5.4. Metal Production in the Outskirts of LBGs\nUnder the hypothesis that the outskirts of LBGs are composed of atomic-dominated gas, we can calculate the metals\n10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 (Figure 4).\n13 This corresponds to \u03bc = 30.5 \u00b1 0.5 mag arcsec\u22122 , or \u03a3\nV\nSFR = (1.3 \u00b1\n0.6) \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 (Figure 4).\n14 This corresponds to \u03bc = 30.6 \u00b1 0.6 mag arcsec\u22122 , or \u03a3\nV\nSFR = (1.2 \u00b1\n0.7) \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 (Figure 4).\n\n\f12\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\nproduced due to in situ star formation from z = 10 to z = 3,\nand compare this to the metals observed in DLAs at z = 3.\nThe metal production can be measured from the outskirts of\nthe LBG composite since the FUV luminosity is a sensitive\nmeasure of star formation, since the massive stars produce the\nUV photons as well as the majority of the metals. The comoving density of metals produced is obtained by integrating\nthe comoving SFR density (\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 ) from the most recent galaxy\nsurveys (Bouwens et al. 2010a,b; Reddy & Steidel 2009). We\nnote that the resultant metallicities are only valid if the outskirts of LBGs are composed of atomic-dominated gas, as we\ndivide by the H I mass density, \u03c1HI , to obtain the metallicity.\nFirst, we integrate \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 for all LBGs from z \u223c 3 to z \u223c\n10 using the \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 values from Bouwens et al. (2010a,b) and\nReddy & Steidel (2009) to calculate the total mass of metals produced in LBGs by z \u223c 3 similar to Pettini (1999, 2004,\n2006) and Wolfe et al. (2003a). Specifically, we calculate the\ncomoving mass density of stars at z \u223c 3 by\n\u03c1\u2217,LBG =\n\nZ\n\nz=10\n\nz=3\n\n\u03c1\u0307\u2217,LBG\n\ndt\ndz = 1.1 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123\ndz\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n1\ndt\n=\n.\ndz (1 + z)H(z)\n\n(12)\n\nIn order to obtain the comoving mass density of stars in\nthe outskirts of LBGs, we multiply this result by the fraction of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 observed in the outer region of the composite LBG\nstack compared to the total \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 observed, f , which we list\nin Table 2. We can then calculate the total mass in metals produced by z \u223c 3 using the estimated conversion factor\n\u03c1\u0307metals = (1/64) \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 by Conti et al. (2003), which is a factor of\n1.5 lower than the metal production rate originally estimated\nby Madau et al. (1996). The metallicity of the presumed DLA\ngas is then calculated by dividing by \u03c1HI at z \u223c 3, where we\nuse average value of \u03c1HI over the redshift range 2.4 . z . 3.5\nof (9.0 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 107 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 (Prochaska & Wolfe 2009).\nThe final metallicities are tabulated in Table 2 in terms of\nthe solar metallicity, where Z\u2299 = 0.0134 (Asplund et al. 2009;\nGrevesse et al. 2010). The metallicities range from 0.12Z\u2299 to\n0.19Z\u2299 , similar to DLA metallicities (see Section 7.6). We\nnote that f is independent of the disk aspect ratio (R/H), and\ntherefore so is the metallicity.\n6. STAR FORMATION RATE EFFICIENCY IN\n\nNEUTRAL ATOMIC-DOMINATED GAS\nIn our search for spatially extended LSB emission around\nLBGs, we aim to further our understanding of the connection\nbetween the DLA gas studied in absorption and the star formation needed to explain the characteristics of the DLA gas.\nSpecifically, Wolfe & Chen (2006) searched for isolated LSB\nemission of DLAs, away from known LBGs, in the UDF and\nfound conservative upper limits on the SFR per unit comoving\nvolume, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 . These limits constrain the in situ SFR efficiency\nof DLAs to be less than 5% of that expected from the KS relation. In other words, star formation must occur at much lower\nefficiency in neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas at z \u223c 3\nthan in modern galaxies at z = 0.\nThe surface brightness profile of the super-stack of 48 resolved LBGs (Figure 4) reveals the presence of spatially extended star formation around LBGs. The latest evidence\n\nsuggests that this star formation is most likely occurring\nin atomic-dominated gas. The most convincing evidence\nis measurements probing the outer disks of local galaxies\nthat detect star formation in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas\n(Fumagalli & Gavazzi 2008; Bigiel et al. 2010b,a). In addition, we find that because the covering fraction of molecular\ngas is insufficient to explain the observed star formation in\nthe outskirts of LBGs, the observed emission is likely from\natomic-dominated gas (see Section 5.2). Throughout the rest\nof this investigation, we work under the hypothesis that the\nobserved FUV emission in the outskirts of LBGs is from in\nsitu star formation in atomic-dominated gas. In order to quantify the efficiency of star formation at high redshift in atomicdominated gas, we require a theoretical framework connecting the observed emission around LBGs to the expectations\nbased on known DLA statistics..\nWe develop such a framework in Section 6.1, where we\ncombine the column-density distribution function of DLAs\nwith the KS relation to construct a model that predicts the\ncomoving SFR density per intensity for different SFR efficiencies of the KS relation. We convert the measured radial surface brightness profile from Section 4.3 into this same\nquantity in Section 6.2 and compare it to the model. Through\nthis comparison, we obtain an SFR efficiency for each surface\nbrightness in the profile which corresponds to both a specific\nradius in the profile and a gas column density via the KS relation. As a tool to understand the SFR efficiencies and compare\nour results to those of Wolfe & Chen (2006) and Bigiel et al.\n(2010b), and simulations such as Gnedin & Kravtsov (2010),\nwe convert our results to fit onto a standard plot of \u03a3SFR versus \u03a3gas in Section 6.3. The \u03a3SFR is determined directly from\nthe measured rest-frame FUV flux, and the \u03a3gas is determined\nfrom the \u03a3gas , the KS relation, and the SFR efficiency determined through comparisons of the data with the columndensity distribution function.\n6.1. Theoretical Framework\nWe require a theoretical framework for the rest-frame FUV\nemission from DLAs and start with the one developed in\nWolfe & Chen (2006) for the expected emission from DLAs\nin the V band image of the UDF. After summarizing this\nframework, we expand it to explain the observed emission\naround LBGs as a function of radius (and therefore surface\nbrightness), taking into account the projection effects of randomly inclined disks. Our resultant model in \u00a76.1.2 yields\npredictions of the differential \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 per intensity interval expected from DLAs for different SFR efficiencies. We then\ncompare this model to the data in Section 6.2 to obtain the\nSFR efficiency of the DLA gas.\n6.1.1. Original Framework from Wolfe & Chen (2006)\nThe framework developed in Wolfe & Chen (2006) connects the measured column density distribution function,\nf (NHI , X), the KS relation, and randomly inclined disks to determine the expected cumulative \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 for DLAs as a function\nof column density and therefore surface brightness.

New Differential Approach for LBG Outskirts\nThe framework developed in Wolfe & Chen (2006) was appropriate for connecting the upper limit measurements of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217\nfrom DLAs above a limiting column density and therefore\nsurface brightness, to model predictions based on f (NHI , X)\nand the KS relation. It does not, however, work in the\npresent context of positive detections over a range of surface\nbrightnesses. For this we require a differential expression for\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , rather than a cumulative version used by Wolfe & Chen\n(2006). Specifically, assuming that LBGs are at the center of DLAs, we wish to predict the rest-frame FUV emission of DLAs for a range of efficiencies of star formation\nin such a way that we can distinguish between possible different efficiencies for each surface brightness interval. We\nfind that d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dN accomplishes this by yielding unique nonoverlapping predictions for each efficiency. Each differential\ninterval of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 represents a ring around the LBGs corresponding to a surface brightness and a solid angle interval subtended\nby each ring. This surface brightness corresponds to the column density of gas corresponding to some radius in the radial\nsurface brightness profile and is responsible for the emission\ncovering that area on the sky. If this gas is neutral atomicdominated H I gas, then we can predict the expected d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dN\nusing f (NHI , X) and the KS relation.\nSpecifically, to obtain d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dN, we differentiate Equation\n(13) with respect to N. To do so, we need g(N\u22a5 , X), since\nEquation (13) depends on Equation (14), which depends on\ng(N\u22a5 , X). We find g(N\u22a5 , X) from f (NHI , X) to obtain a general\nform of the equivalent double power-law fit for g(N\u22a5 , X) when\nN\u22a5 < N0 using Equation (15). We find that\ngHI (N\u22a5 , X) = k3 (\u03b1 + 3)\n\n\u0012\n\nN\u22a5\nN0\n\n\u0013\u03b1\n\nh(N) =\n\n(16)\n\nwhere k3 and \u03b1 are the same as in Equation (7), and\n\n\u03b2+2+\u03b1\nN \u03b2+2+\u03b1 \u2212 Nmin\n; N < N0 ,\n\u03b2+2+\u03b1\n\u03b2+2+\u03b1\nN0\n\u2212 Nmin ; N > N0 .\n\n\u001a\n\n(18)\n\nIn the case of \u03b1=\u03b13 =\u22122.00\u00b10.05 for N \u2264 N0\n(Prochaska & Wolfe\n2009),\nthis\nreduces\nto\ng(N\u22a5 , X)=k3 (N\u22a5 /N0 )\u22122 at N\u22a5 < N0 and g(N\u22a5 , X)=0 for\nN\u22a5 > N0 .

On the other hand, the KS relation\nis established on scales exceeding 0.3 kpc (Kennicutt et al.\n2007). This is not an issue, however, because f (NHI , X) typically depends on over 50 measurements per column-density\nbin and is therefore a statistical average over probed areas that\nexceed a few kpc2 (see Wolfe & Chen 2006).\n\n13\n\n1\ni\u03b2\nhI\u03bdobs\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0(1 + z)3\u03b2Nc \u03b2\nCK\n\n\u0013 \u03b21\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\ni, and\ni is a unique function of hI\u03bdobs\nand therefore d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\n0\nthus surface brightness.\n\n\f14\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\nple.

The range of surface\nbrightnesses corresponds to 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 < N < 1 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 .\n\nThe resulting predictions for the surface brightness, \u03bcV ,\nversus the differential comoving SFR density per intensity,\ni, is depicted by the blue curve in Figure 7. The red\nd \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\ni for different values of\ncurves in this figure depict d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\nthe normalization constant K, where KKenn =(2.5\u00b10.5)\u00d710\u22124\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 (Kennicutt 1998a,b).

We plot \u03bcV on the\ny-axis to conceptually facilitate the conversion of these results\ni is a function of N\nlater in the paper and note that d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\nand therefore \u03bcV .

We plot d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\nthe range in \u03bcV that corresponds to Nmin < N < Nmax , where\nNmin = 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , and Nmax = 1 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . The value\nof Nmin is lower than the range of threshold column densicrit\nobserved for nearby galaxies (Kennicutt 1998b),\nties of N\u22a5\nbut at a column density high enough such that we may start\nto see star formation occur. Also, recent results probing\nin the outer disks of nearby galaxies observe star formation\nat low column densities in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas\n(Fumagalli & Gavazzi 2008; Bigiel et al. 2010b,a). Regardless, our measurements do not probe column densities down\nto this level, so the exact value for Nmin does not affect the\nresults.\n6.2. Stacking Randomly Inclined Disks\ni,\nWe wish to compare these theoretical values of d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\npredicted for DLA gas forming stars according to the KS relation, to empirical measurements of \u03a3SFR for our LBG sam-\n\n\u2206L\u03bd NLBG\n,\nC\u2032VUDF\n\n(27)\n\nwhere C\u2032 is the conversion factor from FUV radiation to\nSFR15 , C\u2032 = 8 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 (M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121 , \u2206L\u03bd is the luminosity per unit frequency interval for a ring with area \u2206A,\nNLBG is the number of z \u223c 3 LBGs in the UDF, and VUDF is\nthe comoving volume of the UDF. As discussed in Section\n3.1, we use a comoving volume of 26436 Mpc3 . We recognize that NLBG is dependent on the depth of images available\nto make selections, and discuss this completeness issue in Appendix A.3. The value of \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 depends on \u2206L\u03bd , and therefore\non the inclination angle i for a given measured intensity, in the\ncase of planes of preferred symmetry.\nIn order to determine \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , we average over all inclination\nangles in our determination of \u2206L\u03bd , which depends on \u03a3\u22a5\n\u03bd\ndescribed in Section 5.2. Specifically, we use Equation (9) in\nconjunction with \u2206L\u03bd = \u2206A\u22a5 \u03a3\u22a5\n\u03bd to find \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , where \u2206A\u22a5\nis the area parallel to the plane of the disk. First, we rewrite\n\u2206A\u22a5 in terms of \u2206A, the projection of \u2206A\u22a5 perpendicular\nto the line of sight, and find that averaging over all inclination\nangles yields \u2206A\u22a5 = 2\u2206A. We can then rewrite \u2206A\u22a5 in terms\nof \u2206\u03a9, the solid angle subtended by one of the rings from the\nsurface brightness profile, and \u2206A, yielding \u2206A\u22a5 = 2\u2206\u03a9dA2 .\nUsing this relation, we find\n\u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 =\n\n(r)\n8\u03c0(1 + z)3dA 2 NLBG \u2206F\u03bdobs\n0\n,\nln(R/H)C\u2032VUDF\n\n(28)\n\n(r) is the observed integrated flux in a ring as a\nwhere \u2206F\u03bdobs\n0\nfunction of the radius r.

In the case that \u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\ncalculated above is negative, we take the change in intensity\nover a larger interval.\nFigure 8 shows a comparison of the theoretical model from\nSection 5.2.2 and the measured values from the radial surface brightness profile. The measurements are for a range in\naspect ratios, with R/H values from 10 to 100, similar to Section 5.2. We display the data in two complementary ways.\nFirst, the green diamonds depict results assuming the average\nvalue of the possible aspect ratios, with the error bars reflecting the measurement uncertainties (including the uncertainty\ndue to the variance in the image composite) in order to portray\nthe precision of our measurements.

Variations in the KS Relation Slope \u03b2\nThe SFR efficiencies can also be decreased by lowering the\nslope \u03b2 of the KS relation, while keeping K = KKenn . The value\nof \u03b2 in the literature ranges from \u03b2 \u223c 1.0 (Bigiel et al. 2008)\nto \u03b2 \u223c 1.7 (Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2007). Increasing the value of \u03b2\nwould increase the SFR efficiency, so we do not consider that\nhere. On the other hand, lower values of \u03b2 would decrease the\nSFR efficiency and there are physical motivations to consider\n\u03b2 values as low as 1.0 (e.g., Elmegreen 2002; Kravtsov 2003).\nHowever, even reducing \u03b2 to values as low as 0.6 does not\nreduce the SFR efficiency enough to match our observations,\nand there are no physical motivations nor data to justify values\nof \u03b2 lower than 0.6. Lastly, decreasing the value of \u03b2 not only\ndecreases the SFR efficiency, but it also decreases the value of\ni (see Equation (25)). While decreasing \u03b2 would\nd \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\nmove the blue curve in Figure 9 down, it also moves it to the\nright and does not help the models match our observations.\nTherefore, we focus on other mechanisms for reducing the\nSFR efficiencies by varying the value of the parameter K.\n6.3. The Kennicutt Schmidt Relation for Atomic-dominated\nGas at High Redshift\nAs a tool to understand the low SFR efficiencies, and in order to compare our results to those of Wolfe & Chen (2006)\nand Bigiel et al. (2010b), and simulations such as those by\nGnedin & Kravtsov (2010), we translate the result from Section 6.2 and Figure 9 to a common set of parameters to obtain\na plot of \u03a3SFR versus \u03a3gas . We derive this conversion for the\nemission in the outskirts of LBGs in Section 6.3.1, and for\nthe DLA upper limits from Wolfe & Chen (2006) in Section\n6.3.2.\n6.3.1. Converting the LBG Results to \u03a3SFR versus \u03a3gas\nWe calculate \u03a3SFR directly using Equation (4), where the\naverage intensity is obtained from the radial surface brightness profile of the composite LBG stack in rings as explained\nin Section 4.3 (Figure 4).

The data all fall at or below 10% of the KS relation, showing a lower SFR efficiency than predicted.\n\nincreasing radius, \u03a3SFR will generally decrease with increasing radius. We compute \u03a3gas by first inferring the value of K\nfor each data point that intersects the theoretical curves in the\ni plane, since each theoretical curve is\n\u03bcV versus \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\nparameterized by a fixed value of K. We precisely find the\ncorresponding efficiency by calculating a grid of models with\nK varying by 0.001. We then use this value of K and the KS\nrelation (Equation (2)) to calculate \u03a3gas for each value of \u03a3SFR\ninferred from the measured \u03bcV .\nIn short, we directly measure \u03a3SFR through the emitted\nFUV radiation, and then calculate \u03a3gas for the corresponding K that matches the DLA model. We note that \u03a3SFR is a\ndirect measurement, while \u03a3gas comes from the DLA model\nwhich is based on the column-density distribution function\nof DLA gas. The result is shown in Figure 10, which plots\n\u03a3SFR versus \u03a3gas . We truncate the plot to include only data\nthat overlaps with observed DLA gas densities, namely N \u2264\n1 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , where N is calculated from Equation (3) using\nthe K value determined for that \u03bcV . The dashed line black\nrepresents the KS relation with K = KKenn =(2.5\u00b10.5)\u00d710\u22124\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 , while the pink triple dot-dashed line represents K = 0.1 \u00d7 KKenn . The gray filled area with the 1\u03c3 uncertainty and the black points represent the same data as in\nFigure 9. The green upper limits will be described in Section\n6.3.2.\nThe LBG outskirts in Figure 10 clearly have lower SFR efficiencies than predicted by the KS relation. In addition, they\nappear to follow a power law that is steeper than the KS relation at low redshift. However, there is a large scatter caused by\nthe uncertainty introduced by the sky-subtraction uncertainty\n(see Section 4.2), and the sample variance due to stacking different objects (see Section 4.3). We are therefore cautious\nabout fitting a power law to this data by itself, and investigate\nthis trend further in Section 7.3.1.\n\nwe use upper limits. Also, rather than using the new framework developed above, we use the formalism developed for\nDLAs without central bulges of star formation (Wolfe & Chen\n2006). We start with Figure 7 of Wolfe & Chen (2006), which\nbasically plots the SFR density due to star formation in neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas (i.e., DLAs) with column\ndensities greater than N (\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (> N)) versus \u03bcV 17 . Similar to our\nFigure 9, Figure 7 of Wolfe & Chen (2006) has DLA models\nwith different Kennicutt parameters K. We follow the same\ntechnique of using the intersection of these models with the\ndata to find K values for each \u03bcV . However, in this case the\nvalues of \u03bcV do not correspond to detected surface brightnesses of LBGs, but rather correspond to threshold surface\ni that would be\nbrightnesses, i.e., the lowest values of hI\u03bdobs\n0\nmeasured for a DLA of a given angular diameter. Therefore,\nwe cannot calculate \u03a3SFR the same way as in Section 6.3.1.\nTo determine \u03a3SFR , we first calculate an effective minimum\ncolumn density, Neff , corresponding to the threshold surface\nbrightness of Wolfe & Chen (2006). We do this using the\nK values from the intersection points, the thresholds \u03bcV , and\nEquation 3. We then calculate \u03a3SFR , the average over all possible column densities above Neff , as\n\u03a3SFR = h\u03a3SFR (> Neff )i =\n\nc \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (> Neff )\n,\nR\nH0 Nmax J(N \u2032 )dN \u2032\n\n(29)\n\nNeff\n\n6.3.2. Converting DLA Data to \u03a3SFR versus \u03a3gas\n\nwhere J(N) is the integral in Equation (14). We then calculate\n\u03a3gas using these \u03a3SFR , the above K values, and Equation (2).\nThe resulting values are overlaid on the LBG results in Figure\n10. We emphasize that the two results are independent tests.\nThe DLA upper limits put constraints on the KS relation in\nthe case of no central bulge of star formation, while the LBG\noutskirts data put constraints on in situ star formation in DLAs\nassociated with LBGs. Together, these results show that the\nSFR efficiency in diffuse atomic-dominated gas at z \u223c 3 is less\nefficient than predicted by the KS relation for local galaxies.\n\nTo convert the DLA points from Wolfe & Chen (2006), we\nuse the same idea as that of the LBG data, except that in this\ncase we do not have detected star formation, and therefore\n\n17 The x-axis of the plot is actually \u03a3\nSFR , but \u03a3SFR corresponds to a value\nof \u03bcV , which is easier to understand and makes more sense in this context.\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\n10\n\n10\nKS relation\nKS relation, K=0.1 \u00d7 Kkenn\nLBG R/H range\nLBG Uncertainty (1\u03c3)\nLBG outskirts\nDLAs\nG&K 2010 total gas\nG&K 2010 atomic gas\nG&K 2010 molecular gas\n\n0.1\n\nKS relation\nKS relation, K=0.1 \u00d7 Kkenn\nLBG R/H range\nLBG Uncertainty (1\u03c3)\nLBG outskirts\nDLAs\nG&K 2010 total gas Z<0.1Z\u039f\u2022\nG&K 2010 atomic gas Z<0.1Z\u039f\u2022\nG&K 2010 molecular gas Z<0.1Z\u039f\u2022\n\n1\n\n\u03a3SFR [M\u039f\u2022 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122]\n\n1\n\n\u03a3SFR [M\u039f\u2022 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122]\n\n17\n\n10\u22122\n\n10\u22123\n\n0.1\n\n10\u22122\n\n10\u22123\nMetals with Z<0.1Z\u039f\u2022\n\nAll Metals\n10\u22124\n\n1\n\n10\n\u03a3gas [M\u039f\u2022 pc\u22122]\n\n102\n\n103\n\n10\u22124\n\n1\n\n10\n\u03a3gas [M\u039f\u2022 pc\u22122]\n\n102\n\n103\n\nFigure 11.

The\nsolid red and blue lines are the mean relation for the total neutral-gas surface density (atomic and molecular) and the hatched area shows the rms scatter around\nthe mean. The dotted purple line shows the mean KS relation only considering the atomic gas, while the dot-dashed cyan line shows it for the molecular gas. The\nlong-dashed line is the Kennicutt relation for local (z \u223c 0) galaxies (Kennicutt 1998a), while the triple-dot-dashed line is for K = 0.1 \u00d7 KKenn . The gray and gold\nlines and the black and green points are the data and are the same as in Figure 10.\n\n7. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\nWe present, for the first time, evidence for LSB emission\naround LBGs on spatial scales large compared to the LBG\ncores due to in situ star formation in gas associated with LBGs\n(see Figure 4). Using the theoretical framework developed in\nSection 6.1.2, we model this emission as the average in situ\nstar formation in atomic-dominated gas surrounding LBGs at\nz \u223c 3. Since most of the atomic-dominated gas at high redshift is in DLAs, we assume that this is DLA gas. We find\nthat under this hypothesis, the efficiency of star formation in\nthe atomic-dominated gas is significantly lower than what is\nexpected for predictions by the KS relation. This is clearly\nevident in Figure 10, which compares the local KS relation\ndirectly to the observations. The efficiency of in situ star formation in atomic-dominated gas appears to be a factor of 10\u2013\n50 lower than that of local galaxies that follow KS relation. In\naddition, the SFR efficiency of atomic-dominated gas around\ngalaxies without bright cores is constrained by the thresholds\nmeasured by Wolfe & Chen (2006), who impose similar efficiencies on the in situ star formation in DLAs, as shown by the\ngreen upper limits in Figure 10. Therefore, together with the\nresults from Wolfe & Chen (2006), we constrain the SFR efficiency of all neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas (DLAs)\nat z \u223c 3.\nThere are multiple possible effects contributing to the observed lower SFR efficiencies, including a higher background\nradiation field at high redshift, low-metallicity of DLAs, and\nthe role of molecular versus atomic hydrogen in star formation. We start the discussion by comparing our results\nto the models of low-metallicity high-redshift galaxies by\nGnedin & Kravtsov (2010) in Section 7.1. We then consider\nthe roles of molecular and atomic-dominated gas in the KS\nrelation in the context of the saturation of atomic dominated\nin Section 7.2. We investigate whether there is a variation of\nthe KS relation with redshift in Section 7.3, and compare our\nresults at high redshift with those in the outer disks of local\ngalaxies in Section 7.3.1. We then consider the effect that a\nbimodality of the DLA population would have on the results\nin Section 7.4, and a caveat on the results based on DLA sizes\nin Section 7.5. Lastly, we address the \"Missing Metals\" problem of DLAs in Section 7.6.\n\n7.1. Models of the Kennicutt Schmidt Relation in\nHigh-redshift Galaxies\nHere we discuss two effects contributing to the observed\nlower efficiencies: First, at higher redshifts the background\nradiation field (Haardt & Madau 1996) is stronger, yielding a higher UV-flux environment. This photodissociates\nthe molecular hydrogen (H2 ) content of the gas, raising the\nthreshold for the gas to become molecular, therefore requiring higher gas densities to form stars. Second, the metallicity of DLAs at high redshift is considerably lower than solar (Pettini et al. 1994, 1995, 1997, 2002a; Prochaska et al.\n2003), and therefore has a lower dust content, which is needed\nto form molecular hydrogen and to shield the gas from photodissociating radiation.\nRecent theoretical work (Krumholz et al. 2008;\nGnedin et al.\n2009;\nKrumholz et al.\n2009b,a;\nGnedin & Kravtsov 2010, 2011) suggests that the most\nimportant part in determining the amplitude and slope of\nthe KS relation is the dust abundance, and therefore the\nmetallicity. Gnedin & Kravtsov (2010) investigate the KS\nrelation at high redshift using their metallicity dependent\nmodel of molecular hydrogen (Gnedin et al. 2009). They find\nthat while the higher UV flux does lower the SFR, it also\nlowers the surface density of the neutral gas, leaving the KS\nrelation mostly unaffected. However, they find that the lower\nmetallicity, and therefore lower dust-to-gas ratio, causes a\nsteepening and lower amplitude in the KS relation. This\nyields lower molecular gas fractions, which in turn reduces\nSFR for a given gas surface density, \u03a3gas . This would yield\nlower observed SFR efficiencies similar to what is measured\nin this study.\nWe compare our results with the z = 3 model KS relation\n(Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010) in Figure 11, with a plot showing\nour data overlaid with the model results, and find that their\npredictions are consistent with our findings. This plot is similar to Figure 3 in Gnedin & Kravtsov (2010), as we provided\nthem with our preliminary results for comparison. However,\nthere was previously an error in our implementation of the\ntheoretical framework, yielding slightly different results than\npresented here. Also, here we split the figure into two panels,\nwith the left panel including gas of all metallicities for galax-\n\n\f18\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\nies at z = 3, and the right panel including only the gas with\nmetallicities below 0.1Z\u2299 . Each plot includes the same points\nas shown in Figure 10. In addition, the plots show the KS relation for the simulated galaxies at z = 3 for the total neutral gas\n(atomic and molecular), with the solid lines showing the mean\nvalue and the hatched area showing the rms scatter around the\nmean. The dotted purple line shows the mean KS relation only\nconsidering the atomic gas, while the dot-dashed cyan line\nshows it for the molecular gas. The dashed black line is the\nbest-fit relation of Kennicutt (1998a) for z \u223c 0 galaxies, while\nthe triple dot-dashed line is for K = 0.1 \u00d7 KKenn. The blue line\nin the right panel is closer to the range of observed metallicities observed in DLAs of \u223c 0.04Z\u2299 (Prochaska et al. 2003, ;\nM. Rafelski et al. 2011 in preparation). The use of a metallicity cut of 0.1Z\u2299 is reasonable, since the mass-weighted and\nvolume-weighted metallicity of the atomic gas is \u223c 0.02Z\u2299\nand \u223c 0.03Z\u2299 respectively (N. Gnedin 2010, private communication), matching the observed DLA metallicities nicely.\nIn addition, although the dispersion of DLA metallicities is\nlarge, the majority of DLAs have metallicities below 0.1 Z\u2299 ,\nmaking this a good choice for a cut to compare to DLA gas.\nThe spatially extended emission around LBGs is consistent\nwith both the total and low-metallicity gas models in Figure\n11. While the uncertainties in both the model and the data are\nlarge, taking the results at face value, we can gain insights into\nthe nature of the gas reservoirs around LBGs. The data are a\nbetter match to the model with the metallicity cut of 0.1Z\u2299 ,\ncoinciding with the mean relation for this model. On the other\nhand, the emission from gas around LBGs is also consistent\nwithin the 1\u03c3 uncertainties of the model including gas with\nall metallicities for the part of the rms scatter below the mean.\nThis lower part of the hatched area in the left panel of Figure\n11 represents the gas at the lower end of the metallicity distribution shown in Gnedin et al. (2009), having a mass-weighted\nand volume-weighted metallicity of the atomic gas of \u223c 0.26\nZ\u2299 (N. Gnedin 2010, private communication), which is consistent with that of z = 3 galaxies having an average metallicity of \u223c 0.25 Z\u2299 (Shapley et al. 2003; Mannucci et al. 2009).\nSince the observations fall below the mean model for the\nhigher metallicity model, and coincide with the model for the\nlower metallicity model, we conclude that the metallicity of\nthe gas is most likely around the mean metallicity of the lowmetallicity model, \u223c 0.04Z\u2299 , and is definitely below \u223c 0.26\nZ\u2299 , the metallicity of the model including gas of all metallicities The results therefore imply that the gas in the outskirts of\nLBGs has lower metallicities than the LBG cores. In fact, the\nobserved SFRs and the implied metallicities from the models\nare fully consistent with the outer regions of LBGs consisting\nof DLA gas.\n7.2. The Roles of Molecular and Atomic-dominated Gas in\nthe Kennicutt Schmidt Relation\nThe reduction in SFR efficiency will also be affected by\nthe competing roles played by atomic and molecular gas in\nthe KS relation. There has been some debate as to whether\nthe KS relation should include both atomic and molecular\ngas. All stars are believed to form from molecular gas, and\nsome workers argue that \u03a3SFR correlates better with molecular gas than atomic gas (Wong & Blitz 2002; Kennicutt et al.\n2007; Bigiel et al. 2008). On the other hand, other observations show a clear correlation of the total gas surface density,\n\u03a3gas , with \u03a3SFR (Kennicutt 1989, 1998a; Schuster et al. 2007;\nCrosthwaite & Turner 2007), and the atomic gas surface density, \u03a3HI , with \u03a3SFR (Bigiel et al. 2010b).\n\nThese differences can be understood in the context of the\nsaturation of atomic-dominated gas at high column densities.\nAbove a specified threshold of \u03a3HI , the atomic gas is converted into molecular gas and no longer correlates with \u03a3SFR .\nThis saturation of atomic hydrogen gas above a threshold surface density is clearly observed (see Figure 8 of Bigiel et al.\n2008) for local galaxies at z = 0, and occurs at surface densities of \u223c 10M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Wong & Blitz 2002; Bigiel et al. 2008).\nHowever, below this threshold surface density, there is a correlation of \u03a3HI and \u03a3SFR . This is most clearly seen in the results analyzing the outer disks of nearby galaxies (Bigiel et al.\n2010b), where a clear correlation of \u03a3HI with \u03a3SFR is observed. In fact, they find that the key regulating quantity\nfor star formation in outer disks is the column density of\natomic gas. Further evidence is seen in the outskirts of M83,\nwhere the distribution of FUV flux again follows the \u03a3HI\n(Bigiel et al. 2010a). In fact, Bigiel et al. (2010a) find that\nin the outskirts of M83, massive star formation proceeds almost everywhere H I is observed. While these outer disks\nmust contain some molecular gas in order for star formation\nto occur, they are nonetheless dominated by atomic gas with\nsurface densities lower than the saturation threshold seen in\nBigiel et al. (2008).\nThe saturation of atomic gas above a threshold surface\ndensity is investigated in theoretical models (Krumholz et al.\n2009a; Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010, 2011), which reproduce the\nsaturation threshold for atomic gas in local galaxies. Moreover, the authors find that the threshold surface density for\nsaturation varies with metallicity, where lower metallicity systems have higher thresholds (see Figure 4 of Krumholz et al.\n2009a). In addition, the simulations of z = 3 galaxies by\nGnedin & Kravtsov (2010) show an increased saturation surface density of atomic gas of \u223c 50M\u2299 pc\u22122 , as seen in\nthe purple dotted line in Figure 11. The line clearly saturates, with no clear relation between \u03a3HI and \u03a3SFR above\n\u223c 50M\u2299 pc\u22122 , but with a clear relation below this density.\nSince z = 3 galaxies are typically LBGs with metallicities of\n\u223c 0.25Z\u2299 (Shapley et al. 2003; Mannucci et al. 2009), this\nis consistent with predictions from Krumholz et al. (2009a).\nThe model with only lower metallicity gas (right panel of\nFigure 11) saturates at even higher atomic gas surface densities (Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010), continuing the relation of\nthe threshold saturation of \u03a3HI with metallicity. It appears\nthat \u03a3HI tracks \u03a3gas to large values of \u03a3SFR , and no saturation\noccurs in \u03a3HI until \u223c 200\u2013300 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\nComparison of the saturation thresholds found by\nGnedin & Kravtsov (2010) with our data in the right panel\nof Figure 11 reveals that the data are below this threshold for\nsaturation of atomic gas for all values of \u03a3HI for the model\nwith the 0.1Z\u2299 cut, which most closely matches our results.\nWe therefore conclude that the measured decrease in SFR efficiency is not due to the saturation of atomic-dominated gas.\nIn fact, our data confirm that the atomic-dominated gas does\nnot saturate for \u03a3HI of at least & 100M\u2299 pc\u22122 . This number is\nlarger than predicted for LBG metallicities, yet smaller than\npredicted for DLA metallicities. This suggests that the average metallicity of the gas in the outskirts of LBGs is between\n0.1Z\u2299 and 0.25Z\u2299 . This is consistent with the metallicity estimate made in Section 5.4 of 0.12Z\u2299 to 0.19Z\u2299 based on the\nmetal production rate of star formation.\nWhile molecular gas is very likely needed to form stars,\nit is also clear from results for local outer disks (Bigiel et al.\n2010b) and our results at high redshift that star formation can\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\nbe observed even when molecular gas does not dominate azimuthal averages in rings of galactic dimensions. We do not\nsuggest that stars are forming from purely atomic gas, but\nrather that in the presence of high density atomic gas, there\nare sufficient molecules to cool the gas such that star formation can be initiated by gravitational collapse. We predict that\nmore sensitive measurements of molecular gas in local outer\ndisks would result in the detection of molecular gas. On the\nother hand, recent models by Low & Glover (2010) suggest\nthat molecular hydrogen may not be the cause of star formation, but rather a consequence of the star formation. In this\nscenario, CO traces dense gas that is already gravitationally\nunstable and would probably form stars regardless. More investigations are needed to better understand what is fundamentally required for star formation, and our work provides\nsome observational constraints for such work.\nWe note that even though large amounts of molecular\ngas are not observed in DLAs (Curran et al. 2003, 2004),\nthe molecular gas has a very small covering fraction, and\ntherefore is unlikely to be seen along random sight lines\n(Zwaan & Prochaska 2006). We also note that Bigiel et al.\n(2010b) find that the FUV emission reflects the recently\nformed stars without large biases from external extinction.\nWe similarly do not expect much extinction in the outer parts\nof the LBGs, as DLAs have low dust-to-gas ratios (Pettini\n2004; Frank & P\u00e9roux 2010). Therefore, unless the gas in\nthe outskirts of LBGs is due to star formation in moleculardominated gas, we do not expect large extinction corrections\nto be necessary.\n7.3. Is There a Variation of the Kennicutt Schmidt Relation\nwith Redshift?\nRecent studies of star-forming galaxies at high redshift have\nsuggested that the KS relation does not vary with redshift\n(Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2007; Tacconi et al. 2010; Daddi et al. 2010;\nGenzel et al. 2010). These studies do a careful job of comparing \u03a3SFR and the molecular gas surface density, \u03a3H2 , of\nhigh- and low-redshift systems, and find that the galaxies fit\na single KS relation. This is starkly different than our finding\na lower SFR efficiency at high redshift. Furthermore, these\nstudies differ from simulations of high-redshift galaxies that\ndo find a reduced SFR efficiency (Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010).\nThese differences may be due to comparisons of different\ntypes of gas. In our results, we consider atomic-dominated\ngas as found in DLAs, while the other observational studies\nare focused on molecular-dominated gas with galaxies having high molecular fractions and higher metal abundances.\nSimilarly, Bigiel et al. (2010b) also found a lower SFR efficiency in the outskirts of otherwise normal local galaxies\nwhen probing atomic-dominated gas. There are two different possible scenarios that explain the results. First, the KS\nrelation for atomic-dominated gas follows a different KS relation than the KS relation for molecular-dominated gas. This\npossibility would explain the observed lower efficiencies of\nstar formation in (1) the outskirts of z \u223c 3 LBGs as measured\nhere, (2) the DLAs without star-forming bulges as measured\nby Wolfe & Chen (2006), and (3) the outskirts of local galaxies as measured by Bigiel et al. (2010b).\nOn the other hand, the simulations by Gnedin & Kravtsov\n(2010) focus on galaxies with low metallicities similar to\nthose observed of LBGs (\u223c 0.26 Z\u2299 ) and find reduced SFR efficiencies in both their molecular-dominated and their atomicdominated gas. They also find that the efficiency is directly\nrelated to the metallicity of the gas, suggesting that the de-\n\n19\n\ncreased star formation efficiency is most likely due to decreased metallicities. These models accurately predict the\nSFR efficiencies we measure in the outskirts of the LBGs\nif they are associated with DLAs. The outskirts of the local\ngalaxies measured by Bigiel et al. (2010b) are also generally\nof lower metallicities (e.g. de Paz et al. 2007; Cioni 2009;\nBresolin et al. 2009), so the decreased efficiencies could also\nbe due to the lower metallicity. The SFR efficiencies in\nBigiel et al. (2010b) are similar to this study, and we discuss\nthis below in Section 7.3.1.\nIn addition, Bigiel et al. (2010a) find a clear correlation of\nthe FUV light (representing star formation) with the location\nof the H I gas in M83. In the inner region they find a much\nsteeper radial decline in \u03a3SFR than in \u03a3HI , while in the outer\nregion of the disk, \u03a3SFR declines less steeply, if at all (see Figure 4 of Bigiel et al. 2010a). Similarly, the metallicity in the\ninner part of M83 drops pretty steeply and then flattens out at\nlarger radii (Bresolin et al. 2009). These results are consistent\nwith the scenario that the metallicity is driving the efficiency\nof the SFR.\nWhile it is not yet clear what causes the decrease in SFR\nefficiency in DLAs, the results suggest it is either due to\na different KS relation for atomic-dominated gas or due to\nthe metallicity of the gas rather than the redshift. Given the\nexcellent agreement of our results with the predictions by\nGnedin & Kravtsov (2010), and the suggestive results of the\nouter regions of M83, we give extra credence to the metallicities driving the SFR efficiencies. In fact, these two effects\nmay be the same, as the outskirts of galaxies generally probably have lower metallicities, and therefore lower SFR efficiencies. While all the gas at high redshift may not have a\nreduced efficiency, care must be taken when using the KS relation in cosmological models, as the properties of gas vary\nwith redshift, thereby affecting the SFR efficiencies.\n7.3.1. Comparison of the z \u223c 3 SFR Efficiency with Local z = 0\nOuter Disks\n\nThe environment for star formation at large galactic radii\nis significantly different than in the inner regions of starforming galaxies, having lower metallicities and dust abundances, consisting of more H I than H2 gas, and being spread\nout over large volumes. These environmental factors undoubtedly have effects on the conversion of gas into stars, and perhaps the SFR efficiency. Similar to our results at high redshift, the SFR efficiency in the local (z = 0) outer disks is also\nless efficient than the KS relation (Bigiel et al. 2010b). Figure 12 plots our results of H I dominated gas in the outskirts\nof LBGs at z \u223c 3 from Figure 10, in conjunction with the\nmeasurements of Bigiel et al. (2010b) of the outskirts of local\nspiral galaxies. These measurements combine data from the\nH I Nearby Galaxy Survey and the GALEX Nearby Galaxy\nSurvey to measure both the atomic hydrogen gas surface density and the FUV emission tracing the SFR in 17 spiral galaxies. The blue diamonds in Figure 12 represent the best estimate for the true relation of \u03a3SFR and \u03a3HI from Bigiel et al.\n(2010b) accounting for their sensitivity, and the error bars\nrepresent the scatter in the measurements. The SFRs determined in Bigiel et al. (2010b) from the FUV luminosity use a\nKroupa-type initial mass function (IMF) and the Salim et al.\n(2007) FUV\u2013SFR calibration, while we use a Salpeter IMF\nand the FUV\u2013SFR calibration from Madau et al. (1998) and\nKennicutt (1998b). For comparison with our LBG results,\nwe convert the SFRs from Bigiel et al. (2010b) to Salpeter by\nmultiplying by a factor of 1.59 and to the Kennicutt (1998b)\n\n\f20\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n1\n\n\u03a3SFR [M\u039f\u2022 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122]\n\n0.1\n\n10\u22122\n\nKS relation\nLBG R/H range\nLBG Uncertainty (1\u03c3)\nLBG outskirts\nBigiel et al. 2010a\nBest fit\nBest fit \u03b2=1.4\n\n10\u22123\n\n10\u22124\n\n10\u22125\n\n10\u22126\n1\n\n10\n\u03a3gas [M\u039f\u2022 pc\u22122]\n\n102\n\nFigure 12.

The blue diamonds represent the best estimate for the true relation of \u03a3SFR and \u03a3HI from Bigiel et al. (2010b) accounting for\ntheir sensitivity, and the error bars represent the scatter. These points have been converted to use the same IMF and FUV\u2013SFR conversion as used in this work.\nThe long dashed line is the Kennicutt relation for local (z \u223c 0) galaxies (Kennicutt 1998a). The gray and gold lines and the black points are the data as shown in\nFigure 10. The dotted red line represents a power-law fit to the data with both the normalization and the slope as free parameters, and the green dot-dashed line\nis a power-law fit with the slope set to \u03b2 = 1.4, as described in Section 7.3.1.\n\nFUV\u2013SFR calibration by multiplying by a factor of 1.30.\nWhile these populations probe very different redshifts and\ngas densities, they both probe diffuse atomic-dominated gas in\nthe outskirts of galaxies and have low metallicities. In fact, the\ndiffering redshifts enable a comparison of drastically different\ngas surface densities not possible at low redshift alone, due to\nthe saturation of H I gas above a threshold surface density as\ndescribed in Section 7.2. Specifically, Bigiel et al. (2010b)\ncannot probe significantly higher gas densities, as at z = 0 the\nH I gas saturates at threshold surface densities of \u223c 10M\u2299\npc\u22122 (see Figure 8 in Bigiel et al. 2008). On the other hand, as\ndescribed in Section 7.2, at z \u223c 3 the H I gas does not saturate\nuntil much higher gas surface densities. However, our measurements at z \u223c 3 are also limited in the other direction, as\nwe cannot probe lower gas surface densities due to insufficient\nsurface-brightness sensitivity, and therefore we are left with\nnon-overlapping results for 10M\u2299 pc2 . \u03a3gas . 30M\u2299 pc2 .\nIt is not likely a coincidence that the SFR is less efficient in\nthe outer regions of galaxies at both low and high redshifts.\nIt may be that the SFR is less efficient in the outer regions of\ngalaxies at all redshifts, and this possibility needs to be investigated. There is evidence that the metallicities in the inner\nregions of galaxies observed in emission are higher than that\nin the outer parts sampled by quasar absorption line systems\nat z \u223c 0.6 (Chen et al. 2005, 2007). If the SFR efficiency depends on the metallicity, then we would expect lower efficiencies in the outer parts of these z \u223c 0.6 galaxies as observed.\nComparing the data at low redshift with those at high redshift, we find that they appear to fall on a straight line in log\nspace. We therefore fit a power law to the outer disk measurements in Figure 12, using the KS relation in Equation\n(2) and setting \u03a3c = 1 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Leaving both the normalization and the slope as free parameters, our least-squares\nsolution results in a normalization of K = (1.4 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u22125\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 and a slope of \u03b2=1.3\u00b10.1, and is plotted as a\ndotted red line in Figure 12. In addition, we also fit a power\n\nlaw where we set the slope to the same value as in the KS\nrelation (Kennicutt 1998a,b), namely \u03b2=1.4. This fit has a\nnormalization of K = (8.5 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 and is\nplotted as a dot-dashed green line in Figure 12. The fit is consistent for both the low- and high-redshift galaxy outskirts,\nand the normalization is significantly lower than that of the\nKS relation, with a K value that is 0.03 times the local value.\nWe note that the slope of the LBG outskirts is larger than the\nslope for the outskirts of local galaxies. The metallicities of\nthe outskirts of local galaxies are probably somewhat higher\nthan those in the outskirts of LBGs, assuming they consist\nof DLA gas, and therefore this difference may be a result of\ndiffering metallicities.\nWe acknowledge that we may be comparing different environments when considering the high and low redshift outer\ndisks, but they may be similar enough to tell us about star formation in the outskirts of galaxies. Indeed, both populations\nexhibit similar SFR efficiencies. Measurements of the SFR\nefficiency across a range of redshifts are needed to further explore if variations of the slope are real and evolve over time.\n7.4. Bimodality of DLAs\nThere is evidence to suggest that there are two populations\nof DLAs (high cool and low cool), since the distribution of\ncooling rates of DLAs is bimodal (Wolfe et al. 2008). These\ntwo populations have significant differences in their cooling\nrates (and therefore SFRs), velocity widths, metallicity, dustto-gas ratio, and Si II equivalent widths. The gas in the high\ncool population cannot be heated by background and/or in\nsitu star formation alone, and so Wolfe et al. (2008) suggest\nthat the high cool population is associated with compact starforming bulges, or LBGs. These high cool DLAs typically\nhave metallicities (Z = 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 Z\u2299 ), higher than the average for DLAs (Wolfe et al. 2008). The low cool population may also be associated with LBGs, although it is possible that this population is heated solely by in situ star forma-\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\ntion. These low cool DLAs generally have lower than average\nmetallicities (Z = 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 Z\u2299 ; Wolfe et al. 2008).\nGiven that our measurements in the outskirts of LBGs are\nconsistent with both metallicities, it is possible that all DLAs\nare in the outskirts of LBGs. Alternatively, it would also be\nlogical to associate the high cool population of DLAs with\nthe gas responsible for the star formation in the outskirts of\nthe LBGs, and the low cool population would then naturally\nbe represented by the DLA upper limits from Wolfe & Chen\n(2006). While those DLAs are also likely associated with\ngalaxies, their lower surface brightness may result in this being included in the Wolfe & Chen (2006) sample.\nIf we are mainly probing the high cool DLAs with the extended LSB emission around LBGs, and are mainly probing the low cool DLAs in the upper limits from Wolfe et al.\n(2008), then the number count statistics would need to be\nmodified to account for the different percentages of high cool\nand low cool DLAs. However, these percentages are not yet\nvery well constrained. A reasonable first try to modify the\nDLA models is to use the current observational result that\nabout half the DLAs are high cool and half are low cool.\nIf only high cool DLAs are included, it would lower the expected \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , which would increase the efficiencies of the SFR,\nmoving the data to the left in Figure 11. Assuming that each\nof the two DLA populations represents half the DLAs, we\nfind the data move to the left by about \u223c 0.1 dex. This does\nslightly worsen the agreement of the outskirts of LBGs with\nthe blue low metallicity model, but not by much. Also, in this\nscenario, the gas would have higher metallicities (Z \u223c 0.09),\nand therefore we would expect the outskirts of the LBGs to\nfall to the left of the blue line. Regardless, the uncertainties\nin the models and the data are large enough that they could\nbe compatible with a wide range of interpretations. In short,\nour SFR efficiency results do not drastically change whether\nor not there is a bimodality in the DLA population.\n7.5. Effects of Different DLA Sizes\nOne caveat remains, which is the possibility that if DLAs\nare not associated with LBGs, and the FWHM linear diameters of DLAs at z \u223c 3 are less than 1.9 kpc, then\nwe have not put a limit on the in situ star formation in\nDLAs. However, as discussed in \u00a73.1 of Wolfe & Chen\n(2006), all models suggested so far predict that the bulk\nof DLAs will have diameters larger than 1.9 kpc (e.g.,\nProchaska & Wolfe 1997; Mo et al. 1998; Haehnelt et al.\n2000; Boissier et al. 2003; Nagamine et al. 2006, 2007;\nTescari et al. 2009; Hong et al. 2010), which is in agreement\nwith the observations (Wolfe et al. 2005; Cooke et al. 2010).\nRauch et al. (2008) find spatially extended Ly-\u03b1 emission\nfrom objects with radii up to 4\u2032\u2032 (\u223c30kpc) and mean radii of\n\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 (\u223c8 kpc) which they argue corresponds to the H I diameters of DLAs. While continuum emission has not been detected on these scales, it may have been observed from associated compact objects. In fact, almost all of the Ly-\u03b1 selected\nobjects have at least one plausible continuum counterpart (M.\nRauch, 2010, private communication).\nIf we assume that the sources of Ly-\u03b1 photons are distributed throughout the gas, then we can compare the \u03a3SFR\nvalues from Rauch et al. (2008) to ours. In this scenario, the\nin situ star formation in the DLA gas is the source of the\nLy-\u03b1 photons, which is possibly associated with LBGs detected in the continuum. We note that currently there is no\nevidence for this assumption, and it is counter to the interpretation by Rauch et al. (2008), who assume that Ly-\u03b1 ra-\n\n21\n\ndiation originates in a compact object embedded in the more\nextended DLA gas. On the other hand, we cannot rule out this\npossibility and it is intriguing, so we consider it here. Using\nthe median size of their measured extended Ly\u03b1 emission of\n\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 , we convert their SFRs to \u03a3SFR of 4\u00d710\u22124 \u2013 8\u00d710\u22123 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 kpc\u22122 . This range in \u03a3SFR overlaps our measured \u03a3SFR\nshown in Figures 4 and 10, suggesting that we may be measuring the same star formation in DLAs in two very different\nmethods. If this is the case, then the sizes of DLAs may be\neven larger than otherwise expected. Whether or not this interpretation is correct, we are definitely above the minimum\nsize probed by Wolfe & Chen (2006) of 1.9 kpc, implying that\nthe above mentioned caveat is unimportant. We are therefore\nconfident that we have shown in Section 5 and Section 6 that\nthe SFR efficiency in diffuse atomic-dominated gas at z \u223c 3 is\nless efficient than for local galaxies.\n7.6. The \"Missing Metals\" Problem\nThe metal production by LBGs can be compared to the metals observed in DLAs. Previously, the metal content produced\nin LBGs was found to be significantly larger than that observed in DLAs by a factor of 10 and was called the \"Missing Metals\" problem for DLAs (Pettini 1999, 2004, 2006;\nPagel 2002; Wolfe et al. 2003a; Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2005). However, Wolfe & Chen (2006) found that when taking into account a reduced efficiency of star formation as found in DLAs\nat z \u223c 3, then the metal over production by a factor of 10\nchanged to one of underproduction by a factor of three.\nIn this study, we calculated the metal production in the outskirts of LBGs and found that the metals produced there yield\nmetallicities in the range of 0.12 \u00b1 0.05Z\u2299 to 0.19 \u00b1 0.07Z\u2299,\ndepending on the outer radius for the integration of the SFR\n(see Section 5.3 and Table 2). The average metallicity of\nDLAs at z \u223c 3 is Z \u223c 0.04Z\u2299 (Prochaska et al. 2003, ; M.\nRafelski et al. 2011, in preparation), and the metallicity of\nthe high cool DLAs likely associated with LBGs (see Section 7.4) typically has metallicities of Z = 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 Z\u2299 . We\ntherefore find that if all the metallicity enrichment of DLAs\nwere mainly due to in situ star formation in the outskirts of\nLBGs, then there would be no \"Missing Metals\" problem.\nIn order for the metallicity enrichment of DLAs to arise\nprimarily from in situ star formation in the outskirts of LBGs,\nwe would require some mechanism for the LBG cores, where\nthe metallicity is high, to not enrich the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) significantly from z \u223c 10 to z \u223c 3 (\u223c 2 billion years).\nHowever, large scale outflows of several hundred km s\u22121 are\nobserved in LBGs (e.g., Franx et al. 1997; Steidel et al. 2001;\nPettini et al. 2002b; Adelberger et al. 2003; Shapley et al.\n2003; Steidel et al. 2010). Therefore, the lack of enrichment\nwould require that either these outflows do not mix significantly with the circumgalactic medium (CGM, as defined by\nSteidel et al. (2010) to be within 300 kpc of the galaxies) in\nthe given time frame or that the outflows do not move sufficient amounts of metal-enriched gas to the outer regions of\nthe LBGs to significantly affect the metallicity. We note that\nwe also expect some atomic gas to be in the inner regions\nof LBGs, and therefore a subsample of DLA gas may be enriched locally, although with a smaller covering fraction.\nWhile there are many theoretical models and numerical simulations to understand the nature of DLAs (e.g.,\nHaehnelt et al. 1998; Gardner et al. 2001; Maller et al. 2001;\nRazoumov et al. 2006; Nagamine et al. 2007; Pontzen et al.\n2008; Hong et al. 2010), none of them are able to match the\n\n\f22\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\ncolumn densities, metallicity range, kinematic properties, and\nDLA cross sections in a cosmological simulation. In addition,\nother than Pontzen et al. (2008), they do not reproduce the\ndistribution of metallicities in DLAs. Pontzen et al. (2008) do\nnot yet address the mixing of metals nor the effects of large\noutflows on these metals, and can therefore not address this\nquestion either. These are essential for understanding the production and mixing of the metals, and it is therefore unclear\nat this time if outflows from LBGs mix significantly with the\nCGM, or if they move enough metal content from the inner\ncore to the outskirts to significantly increase the metallicity. If\nthe outskirts are not significantly enriched by the cores, then\nthe observed metallicity of DLAs would be consistent with\nexpectations from the in situ star formation in the outskirts of\nLBGs.\n8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\nIn this work we aim to unify two pictures of the high redshift universe: absorption line systems such as DLAs that provide the fuel for star formation, and compact star-forming regions such as LBGs which form the majority of stars. Each\npopulation provides valuable but independent information\nabout the early universe (for reviews, see Giavalisco 2002;\nWolfe et al. 2005). Connecting these two populations helps\nus to better understand how stars form from gas, an important\npart in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. In doing so, we begin to bridge two separate but complementary\nfields in astrophysics.\nWolfe & Chen (2006) start to bridge these fields by setting\nsensitive upper limits on star formation in DLAs without\ncompact star-forming regions, finding that the in situ star\nformation in DLAs is less than 5% of what is expected\nfrom the KS relation. However, they do not constrain DLAs\nassociated with bright star-forming cores such as LBGs.\nIn the present paper we address this caveat by searching for spatially-extended star formation in the outskirts of\nLBGs at z \u223c 3 on scales up to \u223c10 kpc. We find the following.\n\n1. Using the sample of 407 z \u223c 3 LBGs in the UDF from\nRafelski et al. (2009), we create a composite image stack in\nthe V band, corresponding to the rest-frame FUV emission\nwhich is a sensitive measure of the SFR, for 48 resolved,\ncompact, symmetric, and isolated LBGs at z \u223c 3 (Figure 3).\nWe detect spatially extended LSB emission in the outskirts\nof LBGs, as shown in the radial surface brightness profile\nin Figure 4. This is evidence for the presence of in situ star\nformation in gas in the outskirts of LBGs.\n2. We find that the area covered by DLAs is larger than\nthe area of the outskirts of LBGs for SFR efficiencies\nof K = KKenn and is consistent with DLAs having SFR\nefficiencies of K \u223c 0.1 \u00d7 KKenn (Figure 5). On the other\nhand, the covering fraction of molecular gas is inadequate to\nexplain the star formation in the outskirts of LBGs (Figure\n6). This suggests that the outskirts of LBGs consist of\natomic-dominated gas, supporting the underlying hypothesis\nof this paper. In fact, the covering fraction provides evidence\nthat the SFR efficiency of atomic-dominated gas at z \u223c 3 is\non the order of 10 times lower than for local galaxies.\n3. We integrate the rest-frame FUV emission in the outskirts\nof LBGs and find that the average SFR is \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 is \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 (see Table 2). Combining\n\nour largest possible value of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 in the outskirts of LBGs with\nthe upper limit found in Wolfe & Chen (2006), we obtain\na conservative upper limit on the total \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 contributed by\natomic-dominated gas of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 < 9.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 .\nThis corresponds to \u223c 10% of the \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 measured in the inner\nregions of LBGs at z \u223c 3 (Reddy et al. 2008).\n4. We integrate \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 in the redshift range 3. z .10, and calculate the total metal production in DLAs and get a metallicity\nof \u223c 0.15Z\u2299 . This is comparable to the metallicity of the\nhigh cool DLAs believed to be associated with LBGs with\nmetallicities of \u223c 0.09Z\u2299 . If the large observed outflows\nof several hundred km s\u22121 of LBGs do not significantly\ncontaminate the CGM, then the metallicity of DLAs would\nbe consistent with expectations from the in situ star formation\nin the outskirts of LBGs. This is a potential solution to the\n\"Missing Metals\" problem.\n5. Under the hypothesis that the observed FUV emission\nin the outskirts of LBGs in from in situ star formation in\natomic-dominated gas, we develop a theoretical framework\nconnecting the emission observed around LBGs to the expected emission from DLAs. Such a framework is necessary\nto interpret the spatially extended star formation around\nLBGs. This framework develops a differential expression\nfor the comoving SFR density, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , corresponding to a given\ninterval of surface brightness using the KS relation and\nthe column-density distribution function (Equation (25)).\nWe also develop a method to convert the measured radial\nsurface brightness profile of the LBG composite into the\nsame differential expression for \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (Equation (28)).\n6. We compare the predictions for the surface brightnesses\ni to the measured values in Figure 9 and\nand d \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\nfind that the two overlap if the efficiency of star formation\nin neutral atomic-dominated gas is lower than the local KS\nrelation by factors of 10\u201350. Using these reduced efficiencies, we convert our results and those from Wolfe & Chen\n(2006) into the standard \u03a3SFR versus \u03a3gas plot generally\nused to study SFRs (Figure 10). We find that \u03a3SFR is lower\nthan the upper limits found by Wolfe & Chen (2006) for\na similar range in \u03a3gas , and both results have significantly\nlower SFR efficiencies than predicted by the local KS relation.\n7. The reduced SFR efficiencies in the outskirts of LBGs are\nconsistent with the predictions by Gnedin & Kravtsov (2010)\nfor star formation at z \u223c 3 in neutral atomic-dominated gas\nwith low (< 0.1Z\u2299 ) metallicities (right panel, Figure 11).\nThese models find that the primary cause for the lower SFRs\nis due to the decreased metallicities, suggesting that this is\nlikely the primary driver for the reduced SFR efficiencies.\n8. Our results correspond to gas surface densities below the\npredicted threshold for saturation of atomic gas at z = 3 for\nDLA metallicities, and therefore the low measured SFR efficiencies are not due to the saturation of the atomic-dominated\ngas. In fact, our data support the theoretical predictions\n(Krumholz et al. 2009a; Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010) that the\natomic-dominated gas does not saturate for \u03a3HI of at least\n& 100M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\n9. Our finding of star formation in atomic-dominated gas\nin the outskirts of LBGs is similar to the recent results by\n\n\fStar Formation in LBG outskirts\nBigiel et al. (2010b) who find that star formation in the outskirts of local (z = 0) galaxies also arises in atomic-dominated\ngas (Figure 12). In fact, the two results are consistent with the\nsame power law, and both results find that the SFR efficiency\nin this gas is lower than expected from the KS relation. It is\npossible that the SFR efficiencies in the outskirts of galaxies\nmay be lower at all redshifts, and this tantalizing possibility\nshould be investigated.\n10. We find that the reduced efficiencies of star formation are likely due to either a different KS relation for\natomic-dominated gas or due to the metallicity of the\ngas. It is possible that the lower efficiencies are due to\natomic-dominated gas following a different KS relation than\nmolecular-dominated gas, however, we favor the idea that the\nmetallicity of the gas drives the SFR (e.g., Krumholz et al.\n2009a; Gnedin & Kravtsov 2010, 2011). In fact, these\ntwo effects may be the same, as the outskirts of galaxies\ngenerally probably have lower metallicities, and therefore\nlower SFR efficiencies. While the reduced efficiency may not\nbe observed for all gas at high redshift, care must be taken\nwhen applying the KS relation, as the properties of gas vary\nwith redshift, thereby affecting the SFR efficiencies.\nMoreover, simulations of galaxy formation incorporating\nstar formation need to take these latest results into account,\nas the local KS relation may not be valid when dealing with\neither atomic-dominated gas or gas with lower metallicities.\nFurther observations of star formation in atomic-dominated\ngas are needed to differentiate between these two possibilities\nresponsible for reducing the SFR efficiencies. Future studies similar to this one at a range of redshifts will help give\na clearer picture, as will further studies of star formation in\nthe outskirts of local galaxies. In addition, progress will also\nhopefully be made by measurements of the C II 158\u03bcm line\nemission in DLAs using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array\n(e.g., Nagamine et al. 2006).\n\n23\n\nA.1. Covering Fraction Completeness Correction\nThe covering fraction of LBGs depends on NLBG , and we\nrecover the underlying covering fraction for all z \u223c 3 LBGs\nby applying a completeness correction which assumes that the\nundetected LBGs have a similar radial surface brightness profile as the brighter detected LBGs. We acknowledge that the\nsize of LBGs vary with brightness, but do not have measurements of its variation at these faint magnitudes, and therefore make this assumption. If the fainter LBGs were smaller,\nthen their \u03bcV would be larger at smaller radii, and it would\ndecrease the slope of the covering fraction completeness correction. This would not make much of a difference for the\ncorrection in Figure 5, but it could potentially have a small\neffect on the completeness correction in Figure 6.\nThe first step in calculating the completeness correction is\ndetermining the total number of LBGs expected in each halfmagnitude bin from the number counts derived from the bestfit Schechter function from Reddy & Steidel (2009) in Section\n3.1. Since the number counts in Figure 1 agree well with the\nnumber counts of the sample from Rafelski et al. (2009), we\nare confident that this is the appropriate number of expected\nLBGs. We then subtract the number of detected LBGs in each\nbin yielding the number of missed LBGs per half-magnitude\nbin, N j(mis) , where j is the index in the sum in Equation (30)\nrepresenting the half-magnitude bins. We repeat this for 20\nbins from V \u223c27 to V \u223c37 mag. The results are insensitive to\nthe faint limit, as described below.\nWe then determine the ratio of the flux that needs a correction for each half-magnitude bin, F(mag) j , to the total\nflux of the composite LBG, Fcomp , such that the flux ratio is\nR j = F(mag) j /Fcomp . For each half-magnitude bin, we scale\nthe profile by R j and then determine the area, A j , that the\nscaled profile covers for each \u03bcV . The missed covering fraction, (CA )mis , as a function of \u03bcV is just the sum over all halfmagnitude bins, namely,\n(CA )mis =\n\nThe authors thank Frank Bigiel, Jeff Cooke, Nickolay\nGnedin, Andrey Kravtsov, and J.

COMPLETENESS CORRECTIONS\nThroughout the paper, we use the number of z \u223c 3 LBGs in\nthe UDF, NLBG . However, the number of LBGs detected depends on the depth of our images, and there are large numbers\nof LBGs fainter than our detection limit that are not identified.\nThese LBGs are part of the underlying sample and contribute\ni. We describe our completeness\nto CA , \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , and \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\ncorrections for each of these in the following sections.\n\n20\nX\n\nA j N j(mis) .\n\n(30)\n\nj=1\n\nWe treat the completeness correction differently for atomicdominated and molecular dominated gas. For the atomicdominated gas, we only consider the light from the outskirts\nof these missed galaxies, and not the inner cores. On the\nother hand, for the molecular-dominated gas, we consider\nlight from the entire LBG, making no distinction between the\noutskirts and the inner parts of the LBGs. In this scenario,\nboth the cores and the outskirts are composed of molecular\ngas, so the cores also contribute to the surface brightness in\nthe outskirts for each \u03bcV . The gold long-dashed lines in Figures 5 and 6 correspond to the covering fraction for the LBGs\ncorrected for completeness.\nWe note that while N j(mis) increases steeply with increasing magnitude, R j(ratio) decreases more steeply, and therefore\nthe completeness correction is dominated by the bright end.\nTo give an idea of the magnitude range of the LBGs contributing the most to the correction, we discuss the correction for the entire LBG profile here. The missed LBGs fainter\nthan V \u223c 33 have basically no effect, since the surface brightnesses barely overlap the area of interest. We could have truncated the completeness correction at this magnitude with no\nchanges to our results. The amount of correction depends on\nthe \u03bcV being considered, and half the completeness correction\nfor the faintest \u03bcV values is due to LBGs brighter than V \u223c 31.\n\n\f24\n\nRafelski, Wolfe, & Chen\n\nAdditionally, those V . 31 LBGs only contribute to \u03bcV & 28.\nIn other words, for \u03bcV . 28, we could have truncated the completeness correction at V \u223c 31 without any change.\nHence, the luminosity function used at the fainter magnitudes is not crucial, as those points add negligible amounts to\nthe correction. However, if there was a significant deviation in\nthe faint end of the luminosity function between 27 . V . 31,\nit would affect our completeness corrections when considering both the cores and the outskirts. (see Figure 6). We note,\nhowever, that even if we only correct for completeness for\nmissed LBGs with V . 29, where a drastic change in the luminosity function is unlikely, an evolution of f \u2217 in f (NH2 )\nof \u223c40 would be needed to account for the LSB emission in\nthe outskirts of LBGs. Therefore, variations in the faint end\nluminosity function are not responsible for the disagreement\nobserved in Figure 6. In the case of the atomic-dominated gas\nwhere we only consider the outskirts, the completeness correction is even more dominated by the brightest missed LBGs,\nsince the fainter outskirts quickly do not overlap the \u03bcV of interest, making the total correction very small (see Figure 5).\nA.2. \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 Completeness Correction\nOur determination of \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 also depends on NLBG , and we\nuse a similar completeness correction to Appendix A.1 here.\nWe use the same formalism, using the flux ratio R j and the\nnumber of missed LBGs, N j(mis) as calculated there. We also\nonce again assume that the undetected LBGs have a similar radial surface brightness profile as the brighter detected\nLBGs. However, this time in addition to summing over all\nhalf-magnitude bins j, we also sum over all \u03bcV to get the total\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 missed due to completeness, \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 mis . Specifically, we find\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 mis =\n\n20\nXX\n\u03bcV\n\n\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 R j N j(mis) /NLBG .\n\n(31)\n\nj=1\n\nWe note that similar to Appendix A.1, this result is again not\nsensitive to the correction at the faint end, making the uncertainty of the luminosity function out there unimportant.\nA.3. \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 Completeness Corrections\nThe determination of \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 depends on NLBG , which again\ndepends on the depth of our images. These missed LBGs\nare part of the underlying sample and contribute to the true\nvalue of \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 , but are not included in Figure 8. We recover\nthe underlying true \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 for all z \u223c 3 LBGs by applying a\ncompleteness correction similar to Appendices A.1 and A.2.\nWe use the same formalism developed in A.1 and once again\nassume that the undetected LBGs have a similar radial surface brightness profile as the brighter detected LBGs. Just\nlike in Appendix A.1, we determine the flux ratio, R j , and the\nnumber of missed LBGs, N j(mis) , where the index j represents\nhalf-magnitude bins for different missed LBGs. For each bin,\ni as a function of \u03bcV and\nwe calculate the missed \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\nthen sum over the half-magnitude bins to get the final correci. Specifically, we find\ntion to be applied to \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217\ni\n\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\n\n\u0013\n\nmis\n\n=\n\n20\nX\n\u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217\nR j N j(mis) /NLBG .\ni\n\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\n\n(32)\n\nj=1\n\nWe note that similar to Appendix B, this result is not sensitive\nto the correction at the faint end, making the uncertainty of the\n\nluminosity function out there unimportant. The completeness\ni is shown in Figure 9.\ncorrected \u03bcV versus \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\nB. COMPARISON OF THE SUBSET AND FULL LBG\n\nSTACKS\nIn Section 3.3, we compared the subset and full LBG samples and found them to have similar magnitude, color, and\nredshift distributions. This implies that the two samples of\nLBGs have similar SFRs, stellar populations, and SFHs, and\njustifies using only the subset sample in the analysis to avoid\ncontamination. In addition, the KS relation works the same on\ngalaxies of different morphologies and environments, so we\ndo not expect an effect based on sample selection. Nonetheless, for completeness we investigate how the results would\ndiffer if we had stacked the full sample of LBGs rather than\nthe subsample. A stack of the full sample of LBGs would\ninclude contamination and different morphological areas as\ndescribed in Section 3.3, and therefore these stacks yield an\nupper limit to the star formation occurring in the outskirts of\nLBGs.\nWe repeat the analysis for the full sample stack, and find\nthat it yields SFR efficiencies slightly higher than discussed in\nSection 6.2 for the subsample stack. Specifically, the Kennicutt parameter K needs to be reduced by a factor of \u223c 9 below\nthe local value for the entire outskirt region. The slope of the\ni is similar to the model\nsurface brightness versus \u2206\u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /\u2206hI\u03bdobs\n0\ni,\nand\ntherefore\nyields\nan\nefficiency\nthat does vary\nd \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 /dhI\u03bdobs\n0\nwith radius. This effect is largely due to contamination from\nnearby galaxies, and if we repeat the analysis for half the sample including only isolated galaxies, we find a varying SFR\nefficiency with radius. We conclude that the correct sample\nto stack is the subsample stack, but a stack of the full sample\ndoes not drastically increase our SFR efficiencies. Therefore,\nthe result of lower SFR efficiencies is robust and not due to\nany sample selections.\nWe also repeat the covering fraction analysis of Section\n5.2 for the full sample stack and half sample stacks mentioned above. In both cases the SFR efficiencies of atomicdominated gas would need to be increased by a factor of\nabout two over the results from the subset sample stack to\nbe compatible with the covering fraction of DLAs. Since\nthese stacks include contamination and morphologically different galaxies, molecular-dominated gas from parts of some\nof these galaxies will be contributing throughout. Therefore,\nthese results are also upper limits to the covering fraction\nof the atomic-dominated gas. Regardless, even with significant contamination, this analysis also indicates that our results are robust and not due to sample selections. In addition,\nthe molecular-dominated covering fraction based on the full\nLBG stack is still insufficient to account for the emission in\nthe outskirts of the LBGs.\nREFERENCES\nAbraham, R.
