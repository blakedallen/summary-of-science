A\nmeter length of the designed solid-core chalcogenide based index-guided microstructured optical fiber (MOF) with\ncircular air holes has been exploited to translate wavelength via four wave mixing using a thulium-doped fiber laser as\nthe pump with a relatively low peak power of 5 W. A peak gain value of around 37 dB with full width at half maxima\n(FWHM) less than 3 nm is achieved.\n\nIn recent years a strong interest has emerged in\ndeveloping components and devices capable of operating\nat wavelengths in the mid-IR range (2 \u2013 25 \u03bcm) in view of\ntheir potential applications in astronomy, climatology,\ncivil, medical, military, spectroscopy and sensing areas [1].\nTo design fiber-based devices for these mid-IR\napplications, chalcogenide glasses are very promising\ncandidate because of their extraordinary linear and\nnonlinear properties [2-4]. In addition to their chemical\ndurability, such glasses show very good transparency in\nthe mid-IR regime, and their fabrication technology is also\nwell matured [5].\nSince chalcogenide glasses exhibit a relatively high\nnonlinear index co-efficient (n2 ~ 100 times larger than\nthat of conventional silica-fiber) they can enable\nwavelength conversion from the available near IR sources\nto the targeted mid- to long-IR range [6]. Additionally,\nstudies on MOFs have shown that the zero dispersion\nwavelength in such fibers can be tailored to fall within a\nvery broad wavelength range (typically 2 to 11 \u03bcm).\nMoreover, other attractive features like endlessly single\nmode behavior [7], wide tunability of mode effective area,\netc. make MOFs potentially a very suitable candidate to\ndesign light sources for mid-IR wavelengths.\nFor this application-specific fiber design, we choose\narsenic sulphide (As2S3) based solid core MOF; reported\ntransmission loss for As2S3-fibers is lowest (< 0.2 dB/m in\nfibers of lengths ~ 500 m) over the targeted wavelength\nrange among various chalcogenide glasses [5].\nIn optical fibers several nonlinear phenomena could\nlead to generation of new wavelengths (s) [2]. Under\ncertain conditions, however, four-wave mixing (FWM) is\nthe dominating candidate for generating new\nwavelengths, provided a phase-matching condition can be\nsatisfied. For our intended design purpose, we will be\ndealing with P0 below 5 W, which is considerably lower\nthan the threshold for the onset of stimulated Raman and\nBrillouin scattering. Therefore in this letter, our aim is to\ndesign an As2S3-based solid-core MOF by exploiting\ndegenerate FWM in order to develop a mid-IR source of\nwavelength in the range of 4 to 5 \u03bcm by using\ncommercially available pump sources.\nThe basic mechanism of FWM is schematically shown\nin Fig.1 and can be expressed as [8],\n(1)\n2\uf077P = \uf077S + \uf077i\n\nwhere subscripts s, i and p stand for signal, idler,\nand pump, respectively. Under this interaction two\npump photons at frequency \u03c9p get converted into a\nsignal photon (\u03c9s) and an idler photon (\u03c9i).\n\nFig. 1. (Color online) (a) Signal and idler generation using\ndegenerate FWM (single-pump configuration). (b) Energy\nlevel diagram of a FWM process.\n\nThe equation that governs the propagation of the\nenvelop of signal and idler waves in the fiber, considering\ndispersion up to second order, can be written as\n\uf0b6As,i\n\uf0b6A\n\uf0b6 2 As,i 1\nj\n\uf02b \uf0621s,i s,i \uf02b \uf062 2s,i\n\uf02b \uf061 s,i As,i\n\uf0b6z\n\uf0b6t\n2\n2\n\uf0b6t 2\n\n\uf028\n\n2\n\n\uf06b\uf03d\n\n\uf0e5\n\n2\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf03d j\uf067 As,i \uf02b 2 Ai,s \uf02b 2 P0 As,i \uf02b j\uf067 P0 Ai,s* e \uf02d j\uf071\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P0 and \u03b3 stands for the pump power and effective\nnonlinear coefficient, respectively, \u03b8 = \u03baz, and \u03ba is the\nphase mismatch term, which in highly nonlinear fibers is\ndefined as [2]\n\uf0a5\n\nm \uf03d 2,4,6...\n\n2 \uf062 m \uf028 \uf077P \uf029\n\n\uf057Sm\n\uf02b \uf044k W \uf02b 2\uf067 P0\nm!\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03a9S is the frequency shift due to FWM from pump\nfrequency, \u03b2m is the mth order dispersion coefficient of the\nfiber, and \u0394kW is the phase mismatch due to the waveguide contribution. We can neglect \u0394kW for single-mode\nfibers. To achieve the maximum frequency shift through\nthe FWM process, \u03ba should be zero. Thus considering up\nto fourth order dispersion terms in the expression of \u03ba, the\nbest route to achieve the phase matching criteria for\nFWM would be to tailor the dispersion curve through fiber\ndesign so as to bring the zero dispersion wavelength (\u03bbZD)\nvery close to \u03bbP. Our analytical estimates show that\nmaximization of \u03a9S necessitates simultaneous choice of a\nsmall positive value of \u03b22 and a large negative value of \u03b24.\nThis choice leads to the generation of one IR and one midIR side band (see Fig. 1). This maximum frequency shift\n(\u03a9S) can be expressed as\n\n\f\uf057S2 \uf03d\n\n\uf0f6\n2 \uf0624 \uf067 P0\n6 \uf0e6\n\uf0e7 \uf06222 \uf02b\n\uf02b \uf0622 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0624 \uf0e7\uf0e8\n3\n\uf0f8\n\n(4)\n\nTo maintain the value of \u03b24 negative, the dispersion\nprofile should be flat, which requires the hole-diameter to\npitch ratio (d/\u039b) of the MOF to be as large as possible. At\nthe same time, we need to maintain single-mode\noperation for the pump as well as for the generated signal.\nFor a solid core MOF, if the value of d/\u039b is less than 0.45,\nthe fiber shows \"endlessly single mode\" behavior [7].\nHowever, it is very difficult to achieve simultaneously a\nnegative \u03b24 value for this particular value of d/\u039b;\nadditionally, to enhance the \u03b3 value and to minimize the\nconfinement loss at the mid-IR \u03bbS, effective mode area\n(Aeff) should be as low as possible.\nIn our design we have balanced all the above\nmentioned criteria by choosing an optimized set of fiber\nparameters and by introducing a different size for airholes in the second cladding ring (radius of air holes is\ndenoted as r2) (see Fig. 2) embedded within the As2S3\nmatrix. Here r is the radius of air holes in the remaining\nrings in the holey cladding. All simulations were carried\nout by considering a MOF with five cladding rings of air\nholes as constituting the cladding.\n\nFig. 3. Calculated dispersion of the designed MOF as a\nfunction of wavelength.\n\nThe trend of the generated signal and idler\nwavelengths as a function of different pump wavelengths\nfor a peak pump power of 5 W is shown in Fig. 4. The\nFWM Gain as a function of \u03bbS is shown in Fig. 5. From\nFig. 4 and 5, it can be seen that, for the chosen pump\nwavelength at 2.04 \u03bcm, the signal is generated at 4.34 \u03bcm\nwith peak gain value of 37 dB. Moreover, despite the high\ngain, the gain spectrum is extremely narrow (FWHM ~\n2.6 nm).\n\nr2 = r \u00d7 1.15\nr = d/2\nPitch (\u039b)\nFig. 2. (Color online) Cross sectional view of the designed\nMOF with a cladding consisting of 5 rings of air holes (white\ncircles) embedded in the As2S3 matrix (black background).\n\nTo calculate dispersion characteristics of the MOF,\nwavelength dependence of the linear refractive index [n\n(\u03bb)] of the As2S3 glass has been incorporated through the\nSellmeier formula [9]\nAj \uf06c 2\nn2 \uf028 \uf06c \uf029 \uf03d \uf0e5 2\n(5)\n\uf06c \uf02d \uf06c2\nj\n\nFig. 4.

The nonlinear index coefficient\nof As2S3 is n2 = 4.2 \u00d7 10-18 m2/W. We have chosen the\ncommercially available thulium doped fiber laser at\nwavelength \u03bbP = 2.04 \u03bcm as the required pump.\nDuring optimization of the MOF, a strong interplay\nwas evident among \u03a9S, parametric gain (GS) and\nconfinement loss (\u03b1c) with variations of the parameter r2.\nAfter optimization, a high gain of about 37 dB with input\npump power of 5 W from one meter of our designed fiber\nhas been achieved for d/\u039b = 0.55, \u039b = 1.6 \u03bcm and r2 = r \u00d7\n1.15. The dispersion spectrum of the fiber is shown in Fig.\n3 from where it is clearly evident that the achieved \u03bbZD at\n2.105 \u03bcm is very close to \u03bbP. The values of \u03b22 and \u03b24,\nrespectively were 32.68 ps2/km and -1.6 \u00d7 10-3 ps4/km near\npump wavelength.\n\nFig. 5. Gain spectrum of generated signal for \uf06cP = 2.04\n\u03bcm. FWHM is less than 3 nm.\n\nThe transverse field pattern of the generated signal at\nthis \u03bbS is shown in Fig. 6. The estimated confinement loss\n(\u03b1c) of the fiber mode at this \uf06cS is around1.25 dB/m, which\nis quite favorable to use it as a mid-IR light source. We\nmay mention that by tuning the input pump power (P0)\nwe can further tune the \u03bbS as well as gain (GS) and \u03b1c, as\nshown in Table 1.\n\n\fparameter (r2/r = 1.15) the loss is significantly low (1.25\ndB/m) and it is almost independent of pump power.\n\nFig. 6.

Fig. 7\nclearly indicates that as the ratio r2/r decreases, the\nwavelength/frequency shift increases. However, this shift\nis almost independent of pump power. On the other hand,\nthe gain decreases with the decrease of r2/r (see, Fig. 8).\nSimilar to wavelength shift, \u03b1c also increases with the\ndecrease of r2/r (see, Fig. 9).\n\nFig. 9.

Additionally, narrow\nbandwidth (2.6 nm) and very low confinement loss (1.25\ndB/m) at generated signal (\u03bbS) will make it suitable as an\nall-fiber monochromatic mid-IR light source for the midIR spectroscopy, astronomy and defense applications\nmatching the second low loss transparency window of the\nterrestrial atmosphere.\nThis work relates to Department of the Navy Grant\nN62909-10-1-7141 issued by Office of Naval Research\nGlobal.
