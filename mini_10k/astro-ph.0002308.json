INTRODUCTION\n\n2. SIMULATING THE STRUCTURE OF SIDM HALOS\n\nThe nature of dark matter is still far from being resolved.\nPrimordial nucleosynthesis and observational data suggest\nthat the baryonic material accounts for just a fraction of\nthe matter density in the universe. Fundamental particles remain the most likely candidate for the dark matter\nand much effort has been devoted to researching a class of\nweakly interacting, collisionless dark matter (CDM) (e.g.,\nDavis et al. 1985). However, the hierarchical gravitational\ncollapse of cold collisionless particles leads to dense, singular dark matter halos \u2013 a result that is central to several fundamental problems with this model on small scales\n(e.g. Hogan & Dalcanton 2000 and references within).\nIt may be possible to solve the current problems with\nCDM by appealing to extreme astrophysical processes.\nAlternatively, we can explore other dark matter candidates that behave differently on non-linear scales. One\npossibility is strongly self interacting dark matter (hereafter SIDM). Originally proposed to suppress small scale\npower in the standard CDM model (Carlson et al. 1992,\nMachaceck et al. 1994, de Laix et al. 1995), SIDM was\nrecently revived by Spergel & Steinhardt (1999) to solve\nsome of the outstanding problems with CDM. The behaviour of this component depends on the particles' collisional cross-section. Large cross-sections imply short mean\nfree paths, so that the dark matter can be described as a\nfluid that does not cool but can shock heat. Particles with\na mean free path of order the scale length of a dark matter halo offers the possibility of conductive heat transfer to\nthe halo cores (Spergel & Steinhardt 1999). In this Letter\nwe contrast the dynamics and structure of \"halos within\nhalos\" between collisional and collisionless dark matter\nand compare predictions with current observational constraints.\n\nIn this section we present the first numerical calculations\nof the structure of dark matter halos in which the particles have a large interaction cross-section. Self interacting\ndark matter behaves like a collisional gas and its evolution\ncan be simulated using standard computational fluid dynamics techniques. We model the collisional dark matter\nfluid by approximating its behaviour as an ideal gas where\nthe ratio of specific heats is 5/3. We use the smoothedparticle hydro-dynamics (SPH) code Hydra (Couchman et\nal. 1995) to follow the hierarchical growth of a massive\ndark matter halo. For added confidence in the robustness\nof key results, we perform independent collapse tests using\nan evolution of the Benz-Navarro SPH code (cf. Gelato &\nSommer-Larsen 1999).\nOur cosmological initial conditions were adapted from\nthe \"cluster comparison\" simulation (Frenk et al. 1999),\nin which a massive dark matter halo forms within a 64\nMpc box of a critical density universe. (We adopt H0 =\n50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 throughout.) We carry out two simulations; the first is a CDM plus 10% non-radiative gas and\nthe second run is 100% non-radiative gas (\u2261 SIDM). The\nparticle mass is approximately 8.6 \u00d7 109M\u2299 and the effective force resolution is 0.3% of the virial radius of the final\ncluster rvir = 2.7 Mpc (see Figure 1).\nThe CDM run behaves as expected and as characterised\nby many previous authors (e.g., Barnes & Efstathiou 1987,\nFrenk et al. 1999). One interesting point to highlight from\nthis and similar simulations is that the gas ends up with\na shallower density profile than the dark matter (cf. Figure 2). This is due to energy transfer between the two\ncomponents and the fact that the entropy of the gas can increase through shocks that occur during the gravitational\n\n1 Physics\n\nDepartment, University of Durham, Durham City, UK\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCollisional dark matter\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 1.- Panel (a) is a view of the central 32 Mpc region of our SIDM simulation at a redshift z=0. Panel (b) shows the velocity vectors\nof particles within the central 500 kpc of one of the SIDM halos. The system is viewed face on to the most flattened plane demonstrating the\ncoherent rotation. Dense, but heavily stripped substructure halos can be found sinking deep into the central regions - frequently prograde\nwith the halo angular momentum. Panel (c) shows the high resolution halo in the CDM simulation to be compared with panel (d) that shows\nthe corresponding halo from the SIDM simulation. Both of these halos are plotted to their virial radius.\n\ncollapse. On large scales the SIDM run is similar to the\nCDM run although we note that the filaments appear narrower. On non-linear scales the two models behave very\ndifferently and we now discuss the salient features in more\ndetail.\n\ntions resemble the former collapse which results in singular isothermal structures - what is needed is a mechanism\nthat prevents low entropy material surviving, such as we\nfind in more violent collapses.\n2.2. Ram pressure truncation and viscous drag\n\n2.1. Density profiles\nThe final density profile of the most massive SIDM halo\nis shown next to its collisionless counterpart in Figure 2.\nThis halo has more than 105 particles within its virial radius. The profile is close to a singular isothermal sphere\nwith slope \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22122 , even in the very central region. The\nhierarchical collapse imparts thermal energy into the particles which leads to a small amount of pressure support,\nhowever this is not sufficient to flatten their inner profiles.\nTo check these results we performed 3D spherical collapses of power-law spheres with zero initial kinetic energy\nand density profiles \u03c1(r) \u221d rn with n = \u22121, 0, +1. We\nfound consistent results with 100 and 5000 particles, indicating that the singular profile in the cosmological SIDM\nsimulation is not purely an artifact of the high-redshift\nprogenitor collapses being inadequately resolved. The collapse with n = \u22121 leads to a singular spherical isothermal\nstructure. In this case the central particles are not strongly\nshocked and stay at a low entropy. The n = 0 and n = +1\ncollapes generate much higher entropies throughout the\nsystem. SIDM particles fall in from larger radii achieving\nhigher velocities and significant thermal energy is generated during the collapse resulting in a pressure supported\nconstant density core. A similar point has been made by\nBertschinger (1985). Our cosmological Gaussian flucua-\n\nHalos of SIDM suffer ram-pressure truncation and\nram-pressure/viscous drag, however dynamical friction is\nlargely suppressed in SIDM models since the bow shocks\nand the collisional nature of the fluid inhibit the formation of trailing density wakes. A good approximation is to adopt isothermal profiles for the substructure\nhalo (subscript s) and parent halo (subscript p) such that\n\u03c1(r) = v 2 /(4\u03c0Gr2 ). The ram pressure, \u03c1(rp )vp2 , can be\nequated to the force required to retain a shell of material at radius rs from the centre of the substructure halo\nF \u2248 ms vs2 /rs . Thus the stripping radius at position rp in\nthe parent halo is rstrip = krp (vs /vp )2 where k is a constant of order \u03c0. This can be contrasted with the tidal\nradius of embedded isothermal halos, rtidal = rp (vs /vp ).\nTherefore, substructure halos of SIDM will be stripped to\nsubstantially smaller sizes than their CDM counterparts.\nIt is also interesting to compare the timescale for a\nsubstructure halo to sink to the centre of a larger system due to hydro-dynamical drag, Fdrag = \u03c1(rp )vp2 4\u03c0rs2 .\nFor a circular orbit, L = rp vp , and the rate of specific angular momentum loss, dL/dt = rp F/ms , therefore\nrp\u22121 drp /dt = F/(ms vp ). As the substructure is dragged\ndeeper into the central potential, its radius decreases as\ncalculated above and we can substitute for vs . Thus we\nfind drp /dt = kvp such that the drag timescale is simply\n\n\fMoore et al.\nof order of the crossing time tdrag = krp /vp . All SIDM\nsubstructure halos sink at a similar rate independent of\ntheir mass and on a timescale that is typically faster than\nthat due to dynamical friction.\n\n3\n\nal. 1997). The angular momentum of SIDM halos is redistributed differently than in the CDM halos leading to a\nrotationally flattened central core. The baryons are most\nlikely to dissipate into this plane that aligns with the large\nscale filamentary structure. It is material that flows from\nthese cold filaments into the larger halos that spins up the\ndark matter: satellites infalling along this \"special\" plane\nwill rapidly sink once they make contact with the SIDM\ngalaxy halos. Furthermore, those satellites sinking in the\nretrograde direction to the parent halo's angular momentum will be preferentially destroyed due to the enhanced\ndrag which is \u221d v 2 (cf. Figure 1b).\n2.4. Halo shapes\nThe shapes of dark matter halos provide another clear\ndiscriminant between SIDM and CDM. The typical ratio\nof short to long axis for CDM halos is 0.5 with a lognormal distribution (Barnes & Efstathiou 1987). Figure 3\nshows the ratio of short to long axis, c/a, and intermediate to long axis, b/a, as a function of radius for a well\nresolved halo in the simulation. The virialised part of the\nhalo is rotationally flattened into an oblate shape such\nthat \u01ebmax \u2248 0.2. This is typical of the other SIDM halos which are generally flattened in the range 0.0<\n\u223c\u01eb<\n\u223c0.2.\nFor comparison we also show the shape of the same halo\nin the collisionless CDM simulation which has a prolate\nconfiguration with c/a \u2248 b/a = 0.6 within rvir .\n\nFig. 2.- The radial density profiles of CDM versus SIDM halos.\nThe spherical collapse halos are plotted using an arbitrary scale at\nthe upper right. In this case, the solid curve is the CDM density\nprofile, the dotted and dashed curves are the the spherical SIDM\ncollapses with n = 0 and n = \u22121 respectively. The density profiles\nof the hierarchical collapses are shown for SIDM (dotted curve) and\nfor CDM (solid curve) with 10% non-radiative gas (dashed curve).\n\n2.3. Orbital and velocity bias\nThese results have fascinating implications for biasing\nand the survival of substructure within dense environments. In dynamically old objects, such as galaxy halos,\nthere may have been time for most of their substructure to\nsink to the centre. Any surviving substructure that passes\nclose to the Galactic disk will be stripped to a negligible\nmass, therefore disk heating is not a problem in SIDM\nmodels. Hydro-dynamical destruction may be happening\nto the Sagittarius dwarf right now: its current SIDM halo\nradius would be approximately 100 pc. We may also expect that galaxies orbiting through the central regions of\nrich clusters will have lost most of their dark matter halos. Younger systems, such as galaxy clusters have only\nhad sufficient time to concentrate and bias their \"satellites\" towards the central regions. SIDM satellites suffer\nsignificant velocity bias due to drag: an analysis of the 20\nmost massive satellites within the largest dark matter halo\nyields \u03c3SIDM /\u03c3CDM = 0.85.\nThe orbits of the Milky Way's satellites with known\nproper motions are surprisingly circular (e.g., Grebel et al.\n1998, van den Bosch et al. 1999), whereas circular orbits\nare rare in CDM models (Ghigna et al. 1998). We find that\nthe anisotropy parameter for SIDM satellites, \u03b2SIDM = 0.5,\ncompared with \u03b2CDM = 0.32 (where \u03b2 = vt2 /(vt2 + vr2 )),\nwhich results from the efficient angular momentum loss of\nsatellites at pericentre. SIDM may also account for the\n\"Holmberg\u2013Zaritsky\" effect (Holmberg 1969, Zaritsky et\n\nFig. 3.- The axial ratios of a CDM and an SIDM halo are\nplotted as a function of radius from the centre. Within the virial\nradius, this CDM halo is prolate, whereas the SIDM halo is slightly\nflattened by rotation into an oblate configuration.\n\nAnalyses of polar ring galaxies and X-ray isophotes\ntend to give flattened dark matter potentials, whereas\ntechniques that use disk flaring and the precession of\nwarps yield spherical mass distributions (Olling & Merrifield 1998). Ultimately, gravitational lensing will resolve\nthis issue, but for now we note that a lensing study of\nCL0024+1645 constrains the assymetry of the projected\nmass distribution to be less than 3% (Tyson et al. 1998).\nWith the notion that collisional halos should be spherical,\nMiralda-Escude (2000) argued that the cluster MS213723 rules out SIDM since analysis of its gravitational arcs\ndemonstrates that its mass distribution must be flattened\nsuch that \u01eb>\n\u223c0.1 in the central region. At the moment,\nSIDM and CDM are both consistent with these data.\n2.5. The extent of halos within halos\nThe dwarf satellites of the Milky Way have internal velocities of order 10\u201330 km s\u22121 , that in isolation would extend to 10\u201330 kpc but are tidally limited according to\n\n\f4\n\nCollisional dark matter\n\ntheir orbits within the Milky Way's potential. Numerical simulations confirm this simple expectation (Ghigna\net al. 1998). For example, the dark matter halo surrounding the Carina satellite would be truncated to rtidal \u2248\n(rperi /50 kpc)(vCarina /vMW ) = 2.7 kpc at its current position. In an SIDM universe, the halo of Carina would be\nreduced to a size rstrip \u2248 400 pc.\nObservations of stars escaping from satellites constrain\nthe extent of their dark matter halos (Moore 1996, Burkert\n1997). Tidal streams have recently been spectroscopically\nconfirmed for Carina (Majewski et al. 1999) and are also\nclaimed for Draco and Ursa Minor (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou\n1993). These observations imply that the dark matter extends only as far as the optical radii, about 300 parsecs for\nall of these satellites and much smaller than their expected\nsizes if they had halos of CDM.\nSimilarly, the dark matter halos of cluster galaxies are\ntruncated by the global cluster potential and their sizes\ncan be constrained by quantifying their effects on strongly\nand weakly lensed images of background galaxies. Natarajan et al. (1999) have analysed several of the clusters imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope and claim that the\ndark matter halos of bright cluster galaxies are severely\ntruncated to between 15\u201330 kpc. These galaxies have typical internal velocity dispersions of 150 km s\u22121 and sample the projected central 500 kpc region of the clusters\n(else they wouldn't lie in the HST frames). Thus we expect rtidal \u2248 30\u201360 kpc from gravitational stripping, but\nrstrip \u2248 10\u201330 kpc from maximal collisional stripping.\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nThe properties of dark matter halos of strongly interacting particles are markedly different from their collisionless\ncounterparts. SIDM halos are close to spherical with a\nmodest degree of rotational flattening. Observations of\nhalo shapes cannot currently distinguish between the models examined here; however, future lensing observations\nwill determine if SIDM is a viable dark matter candidate.\nHalos within halos suffer ram-pressure truncation that decreases their sizes to less than the tidal radius. Current\nobservational data on galactic halos in clusters and satellite galaxies in the Galactic halo are naturally reproduced\n\nin SIDM models: the extent of Carina's halo is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than predicted by CDM. Ram-pressure\ndrag creates significant velocity and orbital bias in the substructure halos which sink on a short timescale-of order\nthe crossing time-independent of their mass. Another\npositive feature of SIDM is the ability to produce satellite systems on near circular orbits which are very rare in\nCDM models.\nBoth CDM and SIDM with a large cross-section fail\nto reproduce observed rotation curves of dwarf and LSB\ngalaxies. We have seen that the final density profiles are\nsensitive to the shape of the initial fluctuations: more violent collapses end up with constant density cores. Alternatively, SIDM with a mean free path between kiloparsec\nand megaparsec scales may solve this problem (Spergel &\nSteinhardt 1999). In this case, particles could transfer heat\nto the cold central regions that occur in standard CDM\ncollapses, creating an initial expanding phase with lower\ncentral density. It is not obvious that a cold core would be\ngenerated and maintained in a hierarchical scenario since\nthe dense mini-halos collapsing at high redshift may form\nsingular isothermal structures. The dense substructure halos would rapidly sink to the centres of the parent halos\nby hydro-dynamical drag, depositing high density low entropy material and conserving isothermal profiles.\nSimulating intermediate mean free paths is relatively\nstraightforward. One technique would be to use the neighbour lists to choose random particles to collide (Burkert\n2000). Simulations in progress will demonstrate whether\nSIDM can reproduce the observed rotation curves of dwarf\ngalaxies. A solution to this problem will naturally resolve\nthe abundance of dark matter substructure in the Galactic\nhalo since substructure with shallow potentials would be\neasily disrupted.\nBM would like to thank Marc Davis for many discussions\nof the astrophysical consequences of strongly interacting\ndark matter while a NATO fellow in Berkeley and the\nRoyal Society for support.
