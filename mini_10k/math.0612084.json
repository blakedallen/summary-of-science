qu'une application.\nAbstract: This note presents the first known class of termination orders for 3-polygraphs,\ntogether with an application.\nPolygraphs are cellular presentations of higher-dimensional categories introduced in [Burroni 1993].\nThey have been proved to generalize term rewriting systems but they lack some tools widely used in\nthe field. This note presents a result developped in [Guiraud 2004] which fills this gap for some 3dimensional polygraphs: it introduces a method to craft termination orders, one of the most useful ways\nto prove that computations specified by a formal system always end after a finite number of transformations.\n\n1 Notions about 3-polygraphs\nThe formal definition of polygraphs can be found in [Burroni 1993]. Here, we restrict ourselves to the\ncase of a 2-polygraph with one 0-cell and one 1-cell: this is a graph \u03a3 over the set of natural numbers.\nElements of \u03a3 are called 2-dimensional cells or circuits. Two 2-cells are parallel when thay have the\nsame source and the same target. A 2-dimensional cell \u03c6 : m \u2192 n is graphically pictured as a circuit\nwith m inputs and n outputs:\nm\n\u03c6\nn\n\nGiven such a 2-polygraph \u03a3, one builds another 2-polygraph h\u03a3i: its 2-cells are all the circuits one can\nbuild from the ones in \u03a3, by either (horizontal) juxtaposition or (vertical) plugging. These two operations\nare pictured this way:\n\u0010\n\nf\n\n, g\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22c60\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nf\n\n\u0010\n\ng\n\nf\n\n\u0011\n\n, g\n\n\u22c61\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nf\ng\n\nThese constructions are considered modulo isotopy (or homeomorphic deformation):\nf\n\ng\n\u2261\ng\n\n1\n\nf\n\ng\n\n\u2261\nf\n\nInstitut de math\u00e9matiques de Luminy, Marseille, France \u2013 guiraud@iml.univ-mrs.fr\n\n1\n\n\f2. Crafting termination orders for 3-polygraphs\n\nDefinition 1.1. A 3-polygraph with one 0-cell and one 1-cell is a pair (\u03a3, R) such that \u03a3 is a 2-polygraph\nwith one 0-cell and one 1-cell and R is a graph over h\u03a3i made of arrows between parallel circuits. An\nelement of R is called a 3-cell.\nThe reduction relation generated by R is the binary relation on circuits of h\u03a3i defined by f \u2192 R g\nwhenever there exists a 3-cell \u03b1 : f0 \u2192 g0, together with two circuits h and k, such that the following\nrelations have a meaning and hold:\nh\nf\n\n=\n\nf0\n\nh\ng\n\n=\n\nk\n\ng0\nk\n\nOne says that the 3-polygraph (\u03a3, R) terminates if there exist no family (fn)n\u2208N of circuits of h\u03a3i such\nthat fn \u2192R fn+1 for every natural number n.\nTherafter, we assume that every polygraph we consider has one 0-cell and one 1-cell. As for any kind\nof rewriting system, the easiest way to prove that a 3-polygraph terminates is to produce a well-chosen\ntermination order.\nDefinition 1.2. A termination order on a 2-polygraph \u03a3 is a strict order > on parallel circuits such that\nthere exist no family (fn)n\u2208N of circuits with fn > fn+1 for every n and such that, for any circuit f, the\nmaps f \u22170 (*), (*) \u22170 f, f \u22171 (*) and (*) \u22171 f are strictly monotone.\nProposition 1.3. Let (\u03a3, R) be a 3-polygraph and > be a termination order on \u03a3. If, for any 3-cell \u03b1\nfrom f to g, the inequality f > g holds, then (\u03a3, R) terminates.\n\n2 Crafting termination orders for 3-polygraphs\nProposition 1.3 would remain useless without a recipe to build termination orders, such as the ones\nthat exist for term rewriting. Moreover, even though circuits are deeply linked with terms, there exist\nobstructions to directly transpose techniques from term rewriting to polygraphs. However, it is possible\nto adapt them.\nLet us give the rough idea. Given a 2-polygraph \u03a3, circuits of h\u03a3i are compared according to the\n\"heat\" they produce when presented with some \"courant intensities\". The courants are plugged into\neach input and each output of a given circuit f. Then, they propagate through f to reach all the circuit\ncomponents (elements of \u03a3) used to build f. Each component produces some heat, depending on the\nintensities of the courants it receives. The heat produced by f is the sum of all the heats produced by\nthe components of f. Given another circuit g, parallel to f, f will be declared greater than g if it always\nproduces more heat than g when both receive the same courant intensities.\nIn order to formalize these ideas, we use two non-empty ordered sets X and Y, for the courants: X is\nfor descending courants, or courants going from the inputs to the outputs, and Y for ascending courants.\nWe need also a commutative monoid M, equipped with an order relation, such that the sum is strictly\nmonotone in both arguments: this is used to express heats. Finally, for each 2-cell \u03c6 in \u03a3, we require\nthree monotone maps \u03c6\u2217 : Xm \u2192 Xn, \u03c6\u2217 : Y n \u2192 Y m and [\u03c6] : Xm \u00d7 Y n \u2192 M, respectively\nexpressing how \u03c6 transmits descending courants, how \u03c6 transmits ascending courants and how much\nheat it produces.\n\n2\n\n\f3. Termination orders at work\n\nDefinition 2.1. The three interpretations (*)\u2217 , (*)\u2217 and [*] are extended from 2-cells to circuits this way:\nn\u2217 = IdYn\n(f \u22c60 g)\u2217 = (f\u2217 , g\u2217 )\n(f \u22c61 g)\u2217 = f\u2217 \u25e6 g\u2217\n\nn\u2217 = IdXn\n(f \u22c60 g)\u2217 = (f\u2217 , g\u2217 )\n(f \u22c61 g)\u2217 = g\u2217 \u25e6 f\u2217\n\n[n](~x, ~y) = 0\n[f \u22c60 g](~x,~x \u2032 , ~y, ~y \u2032 ) = [f](~x, ~y) + [g](~x \u2032 , ~y \u2032 )\n[f \u22c61 g](~x, ~y) = [f](~x, g\u2217 (~y)) + [g](f\u2217 (~x), ~y)\n\nOne has to prove that the three interpretations (*)\u2217 , (*)\u2217 and [*] are well-defined on every circuit and that,\nfor each circuit f, the three maps f\u2217 , f\u2217 and [f] are monotone [Guiraud 2004]. Now we define an order\non parallel circuits and prove the main result.\nDefinition 2.2. With the same notations, one defines a binary relation > on parallel circuits of h\u03a3i: let f\nand g be two circuits with m inputs and n outputs. Then f > g if, for any ~x \u2208 Xm, ~y \u2208 Y n, the\ninequalities f\u2217 (~x) \u2265 g\u2217 (~x), f\u2217 (~y) \u2265 g\u2217 (~y) and [f](~x, ~y) > [g](~x, ~y) hold.\nTheorem 2.3. Let us keep the aforegiven notations and let us assume that the order relation on the\ncommutative monoid M does not admit infinite strictly decreasing sequences. Then, the binary relation >\non parallel circuits of h\u03a3i is a termination order on \u03a3. In particular, if every 3-cell \u03b1 in R from f to g\nsatisfies f > g, then the 3-polygraph (\u03a3, R) terminates.\n\n3 Termination orders at work\nThe theorem 2.3 has been used in [Guiraud 2004] in order to prove two conjectures from [Lafont 2003].\nWe present one of them here: it states the termination of the 3-polygraph L(Z2), which is a presentation\nof the structure of Z/2Z-vector space. This is an important point for polygraphs since such a presentation\ncannot exist in the term rewriting formalism.\nThe polygraph L(Z2) has six 2-cells , , , , and , together with sixty-seven 3-cells, pictured\nin figure 1. In order to prove the termination of L(Z2), we consider X = Y = N, equipped with its natural\norder, while M is the free commutative monoid generated by N\u2217 , equipped with the multiset order: this\nis the smaller order strictly compatible with the sum such that p.n < n + 1, for every p and n and\nwhere n denotes the natural number n seen as a generator of M.\nAn application of theorem 2.3 shows that the following interpretations generate a termination order\nthat proves the conjecture. For each 2-cell \u03b1, the first two diagrams give \u03b1\u2217 and \u03b1\u2217 , while the third one\ngives [\u03b1]:\n\ni\n\u2193\n1\n\n\u2191\ni\n\n\u2191\ni\n\ni\n\u2193\n\n1\n\u2191\n\ni\n\u2193\n\ni j\n\u2193 \u2193\n\ni i\n\u2191 \u2191\n\ni j\n\u2193 \u2193\n\ni j\n\u2193 \u2193\n\ni+j i\n\u2191 \u2191\n\ni j\n\u2193 \u2193\n\ni+k\n\ni+k\n\n\u2193\ni+j\n\n\u2191\ni\n\n\u2191\nk\n\n\u2193 \u2193\ni+j i\n\n\u2191 \u2191\ni j\n\n\u2191 \u2191\nk l\n\ni\n\u2193\n\ni+j\n\u2191\n\ni\n\u2193\n\ni j\n\u2193 \u2193\n\ni+j i\n\u2191 \u2191\n\ni j\n\u2193 \u2193\n\ni+j\ni\n\n\u2193 \u2193\ni i\n\n\u2191 \u2191\ni j\n\n\u2191 \u2191\nj k\n\ni+k\n\u2193 \u2193\ni+j i\n\n\u2191 \u2191\ni j\n\n\u2191 \u2191\nk l\n\n3\n\n\fReferences\n\nFigure 1: The sixty-seven 3-cells of L(Z2)\n\nReferences\nA.
