The dynamical interactions between binary and single stars\nin a cluster are assumed to take place only with a continuously replenished\n\"background\" of single stars whose properties keep track of the variations in\nparameters of the cluster as a whole and the evolution of single stars. We\nuse the hypothesis that the neutron stars forming in binary systems from\ncomponents with initial masses of \u223c 8 \u2212 12M\u2299 during the collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores through electron captures do not acquire a high space\nvelocity. The remaining neutron stars (from single stars with masses > 8M\u2299\nor from binary components with masses > 12M\u2299 ) are assumed to be born\nwith high space velocities. According to this hypothesis, a sizeable fraction\nof the forming neutron stars remain in globular clusters (about 1000 stars in\na cluster with a mass of 5 * 105 M\u2299 ). The number of millisecond radio pulsars\nforming in such a cluster in the case of accretion-driven spinup in binary systems is found to be 10, in agreement with observations. Our modeling also\nreproduces the observed shape of the X-ray luminosity function for accreting\nneutron stars in binary systems with normal and degenerate components and\nthe distribution of spin periods for millisecond pulsars.\nKey words: binary X-ray sources, neutron stars, millisecond pulsars, globular\nclusters.\n\n1\n\n\f2 INTRODUCTION\nNeutron stars (NSs) in globular clusters (GCs) are observed by currently\navailable X-ray astronomical methods as accreting compact objects in lowmass X-ray binaries (including X-ray bursters) and by radio-astronomical\nmethods as millisecond radio pulsars that are generally members of binary\nsystems. There is an evolutionary connection between the two classes of\nobjects - millisecond radio pulsars are accretion-driven spin-up products of\nold NSs in close low-mass X-ray binaries (this idea was first put forward\nby Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Komberg (1974); see also the review article by\nBisnovatyi- Kogan (2006); for the most recent observational confirmations,\nsee, e.g., Bogdanov et al. (2005)). The standard scenario for the evolution\nof low-mass Xray binaries and millisecond pulsars (see, e.g., Bhattacharya\nand van den Heuvel 1991) in dense GCs is complemented by the effect of\ndynamical interactions between stars - new binaries formed through tidal interactions, captures, component exchanges, etc. are added to the originally\nexisting binary systems.\nObservational data clearly show an increased concentration of X-ray sources\nand binary millisecond pulsars in GCs (see, e.g., Heinke et al. 2005; Grindlay\n2004; Lorimer 2005), thereby confirming that dynamical effects are crucially\nimportant for describing their formation and evolution (Pooley et al.2003).\nNSs are formed through the collapse of the cores of stars with main-sequence\nmasses above a certain value 8-10 M\u2299 , determined by the chemical composition and, possibly, other parameters, that finished their thermonuclear\nevolution. Depending on the evolutionary status of the star at the time of\nits collapse, the NS birth through core collapse is accompanied by a type-II\nor type-Ibc supernova explosion and by the ejection of a significant presupernova mass in the form of a shell. Data on young NSs observed as radio\npulsars are also indicative of their high space velocities with amean value of\n\u223c 400 km s\u22121 (see, e.g., Lorimer (2005) and references therein; Hobbs et al.\n2005). The hypothesis about a kick velocity acquired by a NS during collapse\nis commonly invoked to account for such high space velocities. The physical\nmechanism underlying this velocity is unknown and there are many speculations and models on this score; many of them were listed and discussed in\nthe review by Lai (2001). Note that deducing the shape of the distribution\nof kicks from observations is coupled with difficult allowance for selection\neffects (Tutukov et al. 1984) and it is believed (see, e.g., Iben and Tutukov\n1996) that nature does without kicks and all of the high space velocities of\n2\n\n\fradio pulsars are attributable to their birth in close binary systems.\nThe hypothesis of high space velocities of young NSs immediately leads to\nthe well-known problem of NS retention in GCs, since the escape velocity\neven in the densest clusters does not exceed several tens of km/s. Most of\nthe NSs born through the core collapse of massive stars should have escaped\nfrom the cluster shortly after its formation.\nIn principle, the problem of NSs in GCs can be solved by assuming a nonstandard mechanism of their formation in GCs, for example, through the\ncollapse of white dwarfs in close binary systems induced by mass accretion\nfrom the secondary component (Helfand et al.1983; van den Heuvel 1984;\nGrindlay and Bailyn 1988; Bailyn and Grindlay 1990). In this scenario, the\nwhite dwarf must be composed of a mixture of O, Ne, and Mg (Miyaji et\nal.1980); mass accretion onto a carbon-oxygen white dwarf ends with its total destruction during the explosive thermonuclear burning that arises when\nits mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, producing a type-Ia supernova (for recent calculations, see, e.g., Dunina- Barkovskaya et al.(2001) and\nreferences therein).\nRecent evidence suggests that, possibly, not all of the young NSs are born\nwith anomalously high space velocities. In particular, this conclusion is\nreached when analyzing evolutionary scenarios that give rise to binary NSs\nlike the binary radio pulsar PSR J0737-3039 (Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Tutukov\n2004; Dewi et al.2005; Podsiadlowski et al.2005). In this binary, the mass\nof the young pulsar is 1.25 M\u2299 , the mass of the old (spun up by accretion)\nmillisecond pulsar is 1.34 M\u2299 , and the orbital eccentricity is low (e = 0.088).\nThis is indicative of a low mass ejected during the explosion of the second\nsupernova in this binary and a low kick velocity acquired by the NS during collapse. It was surmised that the NSs formed through the collapse of\nan O-Ne-Mg stellar core triggered by electron captures do not acquire kick\nvelocities if these stars are members of binary systems (Podsiadlowski et\nal.2004; van den Heuvel 2004). In all of the remaining cases (a single star\nwith M > 8M\u2299 or a star with a mass > 12 \u2212 14M\u2299 in a binary), the stellar\ncore collapses anisotropically and the forming NSs will acquire significant\nspace velocities. As follows from currently available detailed calculations of\nthe collapse of O-Ne-Mg stellar cores induced by electron captures (Kitaura\net al.2005), the mass of the forming NS is 1.25 M\u2299 .\nNote that the range of initial masses for mainsequence stars in which degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores are formed is not completely clear. In the first calculations\n3\n\n\f(Miyaji et al.1980), this range was 8-12 M\u2299 , but Iben with coauthors (Ritossa\net al.1999) subsequently narrowed it to 10-11 M\u2299 ; other evolutionary calculations (Pols et al.1998) yield the range 5-8 M\u2299 , depending on the chemical\ncomposition. Obviously, the particular features of evolutionary calculations\nand, possibly, the rotation of stars are important here. In our calculations,\nwe assumed this range to be 8-12 M\u2299 , since the exact width of this range\nhas no effect on the final results due to the presence of a much less certain\nparameter, the initial binary fraction in GCs.\nSimple estimation shows that for the assumed Salpeter initial mass function\nf (M) \u223c M \u22122.35 with a minimum mass of 0.1M\u2299 and 100% of binaries in a\nGC with a mass of 5 * 105 M\u2299 , the expected number of NSs in the cluster,\naccording to the hypothesis under consideration, is \u223c 1000. This number is\nby two orders of magnitude larger than the expected number of NSs under\nthe assumption of a universal kick velocity with a mean value of 400 km/s\nfor all NSs, which can be obtained from measurements of the space velocities\nfor single radio pulsars (Hobbs et al.2005).\nClearly, whether the hypothesis about two types of NSs is valid can be established only after elucidating the physical cause of the possible collapse\nanisotropy. However, it seems of interest check whether this hypothesis\nagrees with observational data on the number ofNSs of different types in\nGCs, since the absence of a kick velocity during collapse in some of the NSs\nautomatically helps solve the problem of their retention in GCs without invoking other assumptions. This was first pointed out by Pfahl et al.(2002)\nand Podsiadlowski et al.(2004).\nWe used an approach to calculating the evolution of compact stars in GCs\nbased on the population synthesis method in combination with allowance\nfor the dynamical interactions between stars in dense star clusters developed\nat the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of theMoscow State University (see\nKuranov and Postnov 2004). In this paper, we show that the hypothesis\nunder consideration in combination with the universally accepted assumption\nofNS magnetic field decay at the accretion phase (Bisnovatyi- Kogan and\nKomberg 1974) successfully explains the observed properties of NSs in GCs,\nincluding their number and distributions in X-ray luminosity (for accreting\nNSs in low-mass X-ray binaries) and spin period (for millisecond pulsars).\n\n4\n\n\f3 THE MODEL\nThe fundamental difficulty in describing the evolution of dense star clusters\nlies in the necessity of taking into account the mutual influence of the evolution of the stellar population on the evolution of the cluster as a whole,\non the one hand, and the reverse effect of the change in cluster parameters\non the rate of dynamical interactions between cluster-populating stars, on\nthe other hand. The currently available population synthesis codes allow the\nevolution of single and binary stars in the Galaxy to be modeled. There are\nalso codes that allow the evolution of self-gravitating systems consisting of a\nlarge number of star (\u223c 106 ) either of equal masses or in a limited mass range\nto be computed. At present, intensive work is being done to modify and combine the existing codes into a single code. The international working group\nMODEST (http://www.manybody.org/modest/) was created in recent years\nto solve this problem and substantial progress has been achieved in the above\nfield owing to its activity.\nThe code presented here implements one of the possible approaches to describing and modeling the evolution of binary stars in GCs without resorting\nto direct N-body calculations. The basic method of calculations consists\nin the following. A newly formed binary system (an initial binary or a binary formed during the GC evolution as a result of dynamical interactions)\nis placed in a GC where it evolves with allowance made for its interactions\nwith the surrounding stars. The evolution of the GC and \"background\" stars\nis assumed to be known, is identical for each computed binary, and does not\ndepend on the evolution of this binary in the GC model used. The evolutionary track of the binary consists of a finite number of phases. The phases\nchange either through the stellar evolution of one of the components (the\nevolution of an \"isolated\" binary) or through dynamical interactions with\nthe surrounding stars. Our code includes the following types of interactions:\n1. The interactions that lead to changes in the orbital parameters of binaries (semimajor axis and eccentricity) - flyby;\n2. The close passages that lead to star exchanges;\n3. The passages that lead to the disruption of binary systems;\n4. The interaction between single stars that lead to the formation of binary\nsystems (tidal captures).\n5\n\n\fThus, we assume that the evolution of the cluster and its stellar population\naffects the evolution of the computed binary, but we disregard the reverse\neffect of this binary on the evolution of the cluster and the surrounding stars.\nThis approach is somewhat limited (in particularly, it does not allow the\ninteractions between binary systems and the interactions with rare objects,\ne.g., black holes, to be taken into account), but it has a number of advantages.\nThese include the following:\n1. A fairly high computational speed;\n2. The \"clarity\" of calculations that allows the degree of influence of particular processes on the evolution of binaries to be estimated;\n3. The possibility of calculating an arbitrary (statistically significant)\nnumber of evolutionary tracks for binary stars within the framework of\na single GC model.\n\n3.1 Initial Distributions and the Evolution of a Binary System in a GC\n\nAn improved version of the scenario machine population synthesis code (Lipunov\net al.1996) adapted to calculate the evolution in dense stellar systems is used\nto model the detailed evolution of binary systems. We use the following\nstandard initial distributions:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n10R\u2299\nf (log a) = const,\nmax\n< a < 103 R\u2299 ,\n(1)\nRL (M1 )\nfor the semimajor axes of binary stars and\nf (M1 ) \u221d M1\u22122.35 , 0.1M\u2299 < M1 < 120M\u2299\n\n(2)\n\nfor the mass of the primary component. Here, RL (M1) is the Roche-lobe\nradius for the primary component. For the component mass ratio, we use a\npower-law distribution:\nf (q) \u221d q \u03b1q , q = M2 /M1 < 1.\n\n(3)\n\nHere, \u03b1q is the parameter of the distribution in component mass ratio. In\nour calculations presented below, we set \u03b1q = 0, i.e., we considered a \"flat\"\ndistribution in component mass ratio.\n6\n\n\fThe dipole surface magnetic field B of the forming neutron stars was assumed\nto have a uniform log distribution:\n1010 G < B < 1014 G\n\nf (B) dB \u221d d log B,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich spans the range of field strengths estimated from observable single\nradio pulsars (except millisecond pulsars) in the absence of magnetic field\ndecay. The magnetic field was assumed to decay only for NSs in binary\nsystems at the accretion phase.\nIn this case, we used an exponential law of magnetic field decay with time\nup to a certain lower limit (van den Heuvel et al.1986):\n\u001a\nB0 e\u2212t/\u03c4 ,\nB > Bmin\nB=\n(5)\nBmin\nt > \u03c4 ln(B0 /Bmin )\nWe took the field decay time scale to be \u03c4 = 107 yr and the minimum\nmagnetic field strength to be Bmin \u2243 108 G.\nAs we noted in the Introduction, NSs acquire a kick velocity during their\nbirth. This velocity was modeled as follows: we assumed the direction of the\nkick velocity to be random and isotropically distributed and determined its\nmagnitude as\n(\n= 0, \u0010\n8M\u2299 < M < 12M\u2299\n\u0011\n(6)\nf (v) dv\nv2\n2\nM > 12M\u2299\n\u221d exp \u2212 2w2 v dv,\n\nfor NSs from binaries and as\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv2\nf (v) dv \u221d exp \u2212 2 v 2 dv\n2w\nfor NSs from single stars. In both cases, the distribution parameter w was\nset equal to 250 km/s, in close agreement with the velocity measurements of\nsingle radio pulsars (Hobbs et al.2005).\nThe initial NS spin periods were assumed to be identical for all stars and\nequal to P0 = 10 ms.\n\n3.2 Background Stars in GCs\n\nTo properly describe the dynamical interactions of a binary system with other\nGC objects, the code also computes the evolution of single GC stars. The\n7\n\n\fproblem is simplified, because information about the distribution of stars only\nin mass (and radius, for tidal captures) at each time will suffice to determine\nthe rates of dynamical interaction. All of the remaining parameters of a\nsingle star at the current time will be required only if it becomes a binary\ncomponent as a result of the exchange interaction or the tidal formation of\na new binary. This allows us to describe the background of single GC stars\nby creating a discrete set N(mi , Rj , t), where m and R are, respectively, the\nmass and radius of the star at time t, so that\nNTt otal\n\n=\n\nnr\nnm X\nX\ni\n\nN(mi , Rj , t),\n\nj\n\nwhere NTt otal is the total number of single GC stars at time t. In our calculations, we assumed that nm = 45 and nr = 45. The following processes were\ntaken into account in the formation of the background of single stars:\n1. The evolution of single stars. We assumed that the evolution of a\nsingle star was entirely determined by its mass (for a given chemical\ncomposition): Mi (t) = f (Mi0 , t). Choosing a star from the mass interval (Mi (t), Mi (t) + \u03b4mi ) at time t and using the dependence Mi0 =\nf \u22121 (Mi (t)), we then randomly draw the initial mass of the star, according to Eq.(2), from the initial interval (Mi0 , Mi0 + \u03b4m0i ). In turn,\nknowledge of the initial mass allows us to calculate the evolution of the\nsingle star under consideration and to determine all of the remaining\nrequired parameters at time t. Thus, the set N(mi , Rj , t) allows the\nstellar population of single GC stars to be completely described.\n2. The space distribution of background stars.\nMass segregation results in the settling ofmassive stars to the GC center.W e used the Michie-King multimass model (Michie 1963) to describe the GC structure. The space density \u03c1i of a stellar subsystem\nformed by stars with masses in the mass range (Mi (t), Mi (t) + \u03b4mi (t))\n(corresponding to the breakdown of the set N(mi , Rj , t)) is described\nby a power law:\n\uf8f1\nr \u2264 rc i\n\uf8f2 \u03c1ci ,\n\u03c1ci (r/rci )\u22122 , rci < r \u2264 rhi\n\u03c1i (r) =\n(7)\n\uf8f3\n\u22124\n\u03c1hi (r/rhi ) , rhi < r \u2264 rt\n\nwhere rci and rhi are, respectively, the radii of the core and the sphere\nin which half of the mass of the stellar subsystem is contained, and\n8\n\n\frt is the tidal radius of the cluster. Thus, \u03c1hi = \u03c1ci (rhi /rci )\u22122 and\n\u03c1ci = Mtoti /[8\u03c0rc2i (rhi \u2212 32 rci )]. In the case of energy equipartition for\nGC stars, we may assume that\nr\nm\u0304c\nrc i =\nrc ,\nmi\nq\n2\nm (0)\nwhere m\u0304c is the mean mass of the stars in the GC core, rc = 3v4\u03c0G\u03c1\nc\nis the GC core radius, vm is the rms space velocity, and \u03c1c is the central\nstar number density:\nX\n\u03c1c =\n\u03c1ci\n(8)\ni\n\n3. The GC evolution.\nIn general, the distribution \u03c1i (r) is a function of time, reflecting the\nGC evolution. In this formulation of the problem, the GC evolution is\nimportant from the viewpoint of the change in the rate of interaction\nbetween stars. To take into account the GC evolution (the collapse\nof the cluster core followed by its expansion), we used a power law\nfor the changes in parameters rc and vm (t), as follows from numerical\ncalculations (see, e.g., Kim et al. 1998). The core collapse at late\nphases is described by the formulas:\n\u03c1c (t) \u223c \u03c1c (0) (1 \u2212 t/tcoll )\u22121.2 , vm (t) \u223c vm (0) (1 \u2212 t/tcoll )\u22120.12 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere t is the current time and tcoll is the cluster core collapse time.\nAs our numerous calculations show, the core collapse stops as a result\nof the formation of binary stars in the central part of the cluster. The\nsucceeding core expansion can also be described by a power law:\n\u03c1c (t) \u223c t\u22122 , vm (t) \u223c t\u22120.32 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe changes in parameters \u03c1c , rc and vm during the cluster evolution are\nschematically shown in Fig.1. We used two GC models with different\ncentral densities \u03c1c and core radii rc at the collapse time (see the table\nand Fig.1). In both models, the collapse time was taken to be tcoll =\n7 * 109 yr. At the GC formation time, the mass of all cluster stars\nwas set equal to 5 * 105 M\u2299 ; half of all cluster stars were assumed to\nbe binary. Roughly speaking, one third and two thirds of the initial\ncluster mass are concentrated in single and binary stars, respectively.\n\n9\n\n\f4. The evaporation of stars from the GC.\nThe set N t (mi , rj ) also changes through the evaporation of background\nstars from the GC and the formation/ disruption of binary systems:\nX\nt\n\u03b4t\nN(mi , rj , t) = N(mi , rj , t\u22121)\u2212\u2206Nevap\n(mi , rj )\u2212\n\u2206Nbs\n(mi , rj , mk , rl )),\nk,l\n\nwhere N(mi , rj , t) is the number of GC binaries in the correspondt\ning phase volume element (\u03b4mi , \u03b4rj ), \u2206Nevap\n(mi , rj ) is the change in\nN(mi , rj , t) through the evaporation of stars from the cluster core,\nand the last term describes the decrease in the number of single stars\nthrough the formation of tidal binaries. In this case, we assumed that\nt\u22121\n\u2206Nevap\n(mi , rj ) = N t\u22121 (mi , rj )cevap (mi ),\n\nwhere the coefficients cevap (mi ) \u223c m\u22121\ni . Lighter stars with lower masses\nmostly go into the halo and their cluster binding energy decreases. This\nbehavior is to be expected from the main properties of the slow relaxation via pair collisions. The time scale for this process was estimated\nby Spitzer (1969) (see also Mouri and Taniguchi 2002):\nts =\n\n(v12 + v22 )3/2\nm1\n= 1.2 tr0 (m1 ).\n1/2\n2\n8(6\u03c0) G m1 m2 n1 ln(\u039b)\nm2\n\n3.3\n\nInteractions between GC Stars\n\nThe orbital parameters of a binary system moving inside a GC are determined\nby its energy E and angular momentum J. The relative motions of GC\nstars produce continuous fluctuations in the gravitational field; in turn, these\nfluctuations cause the quantities E and J to change. The energy and angular\nmomentum can also change through close encounters and if a supernova\nexplosion occurred during the evolution of the massive binary component, as\na result of which the binary instantaneously loses its mass and can acquire an\nadditional kick due to collapse anisotropy. When each evolutionary track of\na binary system is calculated, the changes in E and J with time are tracked;\nfor a detailed description, see our previous paper (Kuranov and Postnov\n2004). The rate of interaction between a binary and a subsystem of stars\ni with a number density ni (r) = \u03c1i (r)/mi at time t is determined by the\norbit-averaged value\nZ ra\n2\nRij (t) = \u03c3ij \u00d7\nni (r, t)v(r, t)dr/vr ,\nP (E, J) rp\n10\n\n\fwhere rp and ra are, respectively, the orbital pericenter and apocenter of\nthe star in the cluster, v is the space velocity of the binary, vr is the radial\ncomponent, P is the orbital period,\nZ ra\ndr/vr .\nP (E, J) = 2\nrp\n\nThe subscript j(j = 1. . . 4) corresponds to the type of dynamical interaction between this binary and single stars and \u03c3ij is the cross section for the\ncorresponding process. The probability of a dynamical interaction between\nthe binary under consideration and single background stars during time .dyn\nis defined as\nZ ts+\u03c4dyn\np(\u03c4dyn ) = 1 \u2212 exp\nR(t)dt,\n(11)\nts\n\nwhere the total rate of possible interactions is\nX\nR(t) =\nRij (t) .\ni,j\n\nThe scenario machine population synthesis method uses a discrete description\nof the evolution of binary components. In a GC, the evolutionary phase\nof a binary changes in time dt = min{dtevol , \u03c4dyn }, i. e. , either through\nthe intrinsic evolution of one of the components (the evolution of a binary\n\"isolated\" from the background) or through its dynamical interactions with\nthe surrounding stars. The time dtevol depends only on the state of the\nbinary components at the beginning of each phase and \u03c4dyn can be determined\nfrom Eq.(11), in which the probability of a dynamical interaction p(\u03c4dyn ) is\nspecified by a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1].\nTo choose the type of interaction j and subsystem i of single background\nstars involved in the interaction, let us introduce quantities pij that have\nthe meaning of the probability of interaction j with subsystem i of single\nbackground stars for the binary system under consideration:\nX\npij = Rij /R,\npij = 1.\ni,j\n\nNext, we choose a random number p uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1]. We will sumthe elements of matrix pij (whether over its rows\nor columns) until the sum will exceed the number p. The element i, j in\nwhich this occurs will define the sought-for values of i and j. This procedure\nensures an appropriate choice of indices i, j. This procedure is illustrated\nparticularly clearly when one or more elements dominate in the matrix pij\nand when most of the matrix elements are of the same order of magnitude.\n11\n\n\f4 RESULTS OF CALCULATIONS\nThe results of our calculations for the evolution of binary systems in GCs for\nmodels A and B are shown in Figs.2 -8. To obtain statistically significant\nresults for each GC model, we computed the evolution of one million binary\nsystems by the Monte Carlo method. The background of single stars with\nwhich the binary system interacts was computed in advance for each GC\nmodel. The neutron stars that did not escape from the cluster, including\nthose formed in binary systems from stars in the mass range 8-12 M\u2299 without\nany initial kick velocity, were included in this background.\nIn Fig.2, the total number of binaries with neutron stars is plotted against\ntime with a breakdown into subtypes NSs in pairs with main-sequence stars,\nNSs in pairs with white dwarfs, binary NSs, and NS-black hole pairs. The\nbinaries retained in the GC are shown in the left panels. The binaries that\nescaped from the GC are shown in the right panels. The dynamical GC core\ncollapse time is marked by the vertical dotted line. As might be expected, the\nnumber of binaries increases after core collapse. The decrease in the number\nof binaries with time for some of the binary types results from component\nmergers (this is particularly clearly seen for the binaries that escaped from\nthe cluster) and dynamical disruptions. However, the latter effect causes no\nappreciable decrease in the total number of binary stars inside the cluster,\nbut more likely manifests itself as a slowdown in the increase in the number\nof stars with time. The difference in the models of the GC itself is more\npronounced for the binaries that escaped from the cluster: in the more centrally condensed cluster B (lower panels), the number of binaries escaping\nfrom the cluster increases due to more intense dynamical interactions in the\ncluster core. Note also that the number of produced binary NSs proved to\nbe very small; to obtain a statistically significant and proper estimate of the\nformation rate of these important astrophysical sources in GCs requires calculating a larger number of stars and taking into account the collisions with\nbackground binary stars (Grindlay et al.2005). We plan to perform such\ncalculations in the future.\nFigure 3 shows the formation rate of binary systems with neutron stars in\nthe case of dynamical interactions between stars inside the GC: exchange\ninteractions (an impinging single NS occupies the place of one of the binary\ncomponents) and the formation of binary systems through tidal captures.\nThe formation rate through exchange interactions is considerably higher that\nthe formation rate through tidal captures for both GC models. In the over12\n\n\fwhelming majority of cases, a main-sequence star is the NS companion for\nexchange interactions (the formation rate of binary systems with a white\ndwarf as the secondary component does not exceed 1Gyr\u22121 and is not shown\nin the figure). The formation rates of accreting NS observed as low-mass Xray binaries (LMXBs) and millisecond pulsars (MPSRs) formed through the\nsame dynamical interactions between stars in the GC (exchange interactions\nand tidal captures) are shown in Fig.4.\nFigure 5 shows the time evolution of the total number of low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. Different shading indicates the change\nin the number of close binary systems in which accretion onto the NS takes\nplace when a main-sequence dwarf and a degenerate low-mass white dwarf\nfill their Roche lobes due to the loss of orbital angular momentum through\ngravitational waves. We see that the number of objects of this type escaped\nfrom the cluster is comparable to the number of objects left inside the cluster\nand depends weakly on the chosen cluster model. The ratio of the number of\nmillisecond radio pulsars to the number of low-mass Xray binaries is shown\nseparately in Fig.6. Note that the number of millisecond pulsars spun up\nby accretion in the computed models is approximately half the number of\naccreting NSs. One would think that this situation is inconsistent with the\nobservations (recall that one or two strong X-ray sources, many weak X-ray\nsources, and 10-20 millisecond pulsars are observed in a typical GC). However , including the initially single NSs at the ejection phase (radio pulsars)\nchanges the situation: the ratio of the total number of NSs observed as radio\npulsars (spun-up pulsars + NSs with initially weak magnetic fields) to the\nnumber of accreting NS is larger than one (the right panel in Fig.6). It is\ntheoretically clear that the initial distributions of NSs in period and magnetic\nfield and the evolution of the NS magnetic field are crucially important in\nanalyzing these ratios. As regards the observed situation with X-ray sources,\nas we noted above, the situation with weak unidentified X-ray sources remains uncertain and the number of quiescent LMXBs among the weak X-ray\nsources in GCs can increase with time.\nFigure 7 shows the time evolution of the X-ray luminosity function for GC.\nWe see that the luminosity function cannot be described by a single power\nlaw. The smooth steepening of this function near 1037 erg s\u22121 may be due\nto the difference in the regimes of accretion onto the neutron star (Postnov and Kuranov 2005). The mean slope of the X-ray luminosity function,\nd log N/d log Lx \u223c \u22121.3, is close to the observed values of the luminosity\nfunction for low-mass X-ray binaries in galaxies (Fabbiano 2005) before the\nknee at \u223c 5 * 1038 erg s\u22121 . In our simplified calculations, we could not obtain\n13\n\n\fstationary X-ray sources with luminosities above the Eddington limit in the\ncase of accretion onto the neutron star.\nThe period distribution for millisecond pulsars is shown in Fig.8. Recall\nthat the initial spin period of all NSs in our calculations was P0 = 10 ms\n(the second peak in the figure corresponds to this value). The presence of\npulsars with periods shorter than P0 implies that these stars have passed\nthe phase of accretion-driven spin-up in binary systems. We clearly see that\nthe fraction of these NSs increases monotonically after the GC core collapse\nstops. The derived peak at millisecond periods is in qualitative agreement\nwith the observed period distribution of pulsars in GCs (for the GCs Terzan\n5 and 47 Tuc, see Fig.3 from Camillo and Rasio 2005).\n\n5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nHere, we presented the results of our calculations of the formation and evolution of neutron stars in dense globular clusters. Our simulations were performed by the population synthesis of the evolution of binary and single stars\nin the approximation of a persistent background of single stars with which\nthey interact dynamically. We considered two GC models with different star\nnumber densities and different core sizes after dynamical collapse with given\ntime evolution of parameters.\nWe assumed that the NSs born in binary systems through the collapse of\ndegenerate O-Ne-Mg stellar cores induced by electron captures (this was\nthought to be possible at the end of the evolution of stars with initial mainsequence masses in the range 8-12 M\u2299 do not acquire any kick velocity. In\nall of the remaining cases of NS formation (i.e., from single stars with masses\n> 8M\u2299 or from binary components with masses > 12M\u2299 ), the newly born\nNSs were assumed to acquire a kick velocity in accordance with a Maxwellian\ndistribution with a parameter of 250 km s\u22121 . In this scenario, a significant\nfraction of the forming NSs is retained in the cluster. About 1000 NSs remain in a cluster with a mass of 5 * 105 M\u2299 in which half of its stars were\ninitially binary members. In this case, the initial masses of such NSs must\nbe 1.25 M\u2299 . Observations of the GC 47 Tuc (Heinke et al.2005) show that\nthe space distribution of millisecond pulsars in this cluster corresponds to a\nmean NS mass of \u223c 1.39M\u2299 . Since \u223c 0.1M\u2299 is required to spin up NSs to\nmillisecond periods at the accretion phase (Lipunov and Postnov 1984), these\nmeasurements can serve as an indication of an initial NS mass of 1.3M\u2299 .\n14\n\n\fOur modeling of the number ofmillisecond pulsars spun up by accretion in\nbinary systems showed good agreement with the observational data: for the\ncluster models under consideration, we obtained \u223c 5 \u2212 10 millisecond pulsars\nand approximately the same number of such objects are dynamically ejected\nfrom the cluster. The period distribution of spun-up pulsars modeled under\nthe assumption of accretion-induced NS magnetic field decay to a minimum\nof 108 G is also in qualitative agreement with the observational data (Camillo\nand Rasio 2005).\nThe situation with accreting NSs is more complex. In our calculations, we\nfound their number to be twice that of spun-up millisecond pulsars. The observed situation is opposite: there are a few lowmass X-ray binaries among\nthe identified sources in the GC (Verbunt and Bassa 2004). Note, however,\nthat recently the so-called quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries have been increasingly identified among weak X-ray sources in GCs with luminosities\nLx \u223c 1031 \u2212 1032 erg s\u22121 (see, e.g., Caskett et al. (2005) in Terzan 5 and\nHeinke et al.(2005) in 47 Tuc). The number of modeled binaries of this type\nwill probably also decrease when we include the binary-binary interactions,\nwhich have not yet been included in our model. These types of interaction\ncan reduce the binary fraction in GCs with time (for recent calculations,\nsee Ivanova et al.2005). Indeed, when interacting with single stars, a binary\nsystem can be disrupted only if the energy E = mV\u221e2 /2 of the impinging\n1 m2\nstar exceeds the absolute value of the binding energy |Eb | = G m2a\nfor the\nbinary. Here, V\u221e is the relative velocity of the impinging star (infinitely far\nfrom the binary); m1 , m2 , and m are the masses of the binary components\nand the impinging star; and a is the semimajor axis of the binary. Clearly\n, for \"rigid\" binaries (|Eb | > mV\u0304 2 /2, V\u0304 is the stellar velocity dispersion in\nthe GC), the disruptions are more efficient when they interact with binary\nsystems. Since we did not consider the interactions between binary systems\nin our calculations, the disruption rate of rigid binaries was definitely underestimated.\nThe constructed X-ray luminosity function for accreting NSs in GCs has a\nmean slope, d log N/d log Lx \u223c \u22121.3, close to the observed value for lowmass\nX-ray binaries in galactic bulges and elliptical galaxies. This universality\nof the luminosity function for X-ray sources pointed out by Gilfanov (2004)\ncan be explained by common properties of the accretion in low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (Postnov and Kuranov 2005).\nNote that all of the numerical estimates in our calculations depend significantly on the assumed binary fraction in the GC. This parameter may be\n15\n\n\fimportant for the evolution of the cluster as a whole (Fregeau et al.2005).\nOur calculations do not allow this parameter to be separated from other parameters (such as the mass range for stars with degenerate ONe- Mg cores,\nthe total number of stars in the GC, etc.). Nevertheless, reasonable agreement between our calculations and the observational data suggests that our\nmain model assumptions about the evolution of stars in the GC are valid.\nOur description of the evolution of binary and single stars in GCs is not\nself-consistent, since it does not take into account some of the dynamical\nprocesses, such as binary-binary interactions; we also disregarded the reverse\neffect of binaries on the background of single stars by assuming the latter to\nbe replenished to the previous level after each interaction. These processes\nare important in calculating the formation of NS+NS pairs inGCs (Grindlay et al. 2005). We plan to take into account these effects in subsequent\npapers. Nevertheless, the main result of our work will not change greatly:\nthe hypothesis about the birth of some of the NSs in binary systems without\nany kick velocity allows us to obtain in a natural way a sufficient number\nof neutron stars in globular clusters without invoking an artificial retention\nfactor, which becomes unavoidable for explaining the observations if any NS\nduring its birth is assumed to acquire a high kick velocity.\n\n6 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe wish to thank L.R.
