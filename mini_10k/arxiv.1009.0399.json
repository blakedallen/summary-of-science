Even more\ntroublesome, the implication of decoherence for entangled states is far more severe than for a single quantum system. For example, even though a superposition state of one qubit cannot be completely decohered\nwithin any finite time, the entanglement between two\nsuch qubits may be totally destroyed by decoherence\nwithin a very short time [1\u20133]. Evidently then, developing useful schemes to protect quantum entanglement from environment-induced decoherence is crucial\nfor entanglement-based quantum technologies.\nOne promising approach towards decoherence suppression is dynamical decoupling (DD) [4], which advocates\nthe application of a sequence of instantaneous control\npulses to effectively average out the system-environment\ncoupling. Important extensions of the original DD approach have also been developed, e.g., \"concatenated dynamical decoupling\" pulses [5], soft but optimized pulses\nunder an energy cost constraint [6] or a minimal leakage requirement [7], and Uhrig's dynamical decoupling\n(UDD) [8\u201310] sequence that can achieve a very high efficiency of decoherence suppression, i.e., decoherence suppression to the N th order with a sequence of N instantaneous control pulses. Although UDD requires a sharp\nfrequency cut-off in the bath spectrum [11\u201313] and can-\n\n\u2217 phygj@nus.edu.sg\n\nnot operate well if we set limitations on the control pulse\nwidth [14], UDD has attracted substantial interests soon\nafter its discovery. In addition to its high-order suppression of decoherence (at least in theory), UDD for singlequbit decoherence suppression could be powerful because\nit works for most general system-bath coupling [10], for a\nbath that has unknown spectral density (but with a sharp\ncut-off), and for time-dependent system-bath Hamiltonians as well [15]. Experimental studies of UDD under two\nspecific situations have been reported [16\u201318]. For a recent concise review on UDD-related theoretical studies,\nsee Ref. [19].\nSo far the majority of DD studies have focused on\nsingle-qubit systems [20]. Hence it is urgent to investigate if quantum entanglement, e.g., two-qubit entangled\nstates, can be well protected by DD. Because preserving\ntwo-qubit entanglement is more subtle than preserving\nsingle-qubit coherence, we wish to find a general control\nscheme to achieve good entanglement preservation without assuming any particular form of system-environment\ncoupling. Indeed, given so many different ways of coupling a composite quantum system to an environment, in\ngeneral a specific assumption about system-environment\ncoupling may over-simplify the issue of entanglement protection. As such, a universal and efficient DD scheme\nfor entanglement protection should be of sufficient interest. Certainly, if under certain environments some\ncrucial information about system-environment coupling\nbecomes available, then a general DD scheme may be\nfurther reduced, a situation exploited in the first experimental study of entanglement protection by DD in a\nsolid-state environment [21].\n\n\f2\nIn our early study [22], it was shown that an extended\nUDD can also lock a known two-qubit entangled state to\nthe N th order with N control pulses. The present study\nis concerned with the protection of unknown entangled\nstates, a situation that is more relevant for quantum information processing. To that end we extend the recent\nwork by West et al. [23], where a scheme based on two\nlayers of UDD sequences is proposed to suppress both\nthe population relaxation and transverse dephasing of\none single qubit. In particular, we show that by nesting three layers of UDD sequences, it is possible to lock\na two-qubit entangled state as an unknown superposition of two basis states, to the N th order, using about\nN 3 control pulses in total. This entanglement protection scheme is independent of how the two-qubit system is coupled to its environment. The control operators\nused in our nested UDD are also explicitly constructed\nbased on two arbitrary, but known, basis states. We\nshall also show that there are different scenarios in constructing the control operators. Interestingly, it is found\nthat the ordering of the nested UDD layers can be a\ncrucial factor for achieving high-order entanglement protection. This intriguing ordering dependence is absent in\ntwo-layer UDD for single-qubit decoherence control, thus\noffering more insights into quantum decoherence control\nvia nested UDD.\nAs a further extension of our three-layer UDD, we show\nthat it is possible to construct a four-layer UDD scheme\nsuch that a totally unknown two-qubit state can be protected using about N 4 pulses of single-qubit control operators. Experimentally, this might be even more challenging than realizing N 3 pulses of two-qubit operators.\nHowever, such a theoretical possibility is hoped to motivate future studies.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, after introducing the most general system-environment coupling\nfor two-qubit systems, we briefly review our previous extension of UDD from one-qubit to two-qubit systems.\nEmphasis is placed on the key requirements to achieve\nsuch an extension. In Sec. III, we consider two schemes\nfor nesting UDD in three layers in order to protect unknown two-qubit entangled states. Supporting numerical\nresults are also presented. Section IV discusses a fourlayer UDD scheme, followed by Sec. V that concludes\nthis paper.\n\nII.\n\nA.\n\nPROTECTING A KNOWN TWO-QUBIT\nSTATE BY UDD\nGeneral total Hamiltonian of a two-qubit\nsystem interacting with a bath\n\nIn terms of system-environment coupling, two-qubit\nsystems are far more complex than one-qubit systems.\nA general total Hamiltonian describing a two-qubit sys-\n\ntem interacting with a bath can be written as\n\nH = c0 + \u03c3x1 cx,1 + \u03c3y1 cy,1 + \u03c3z1 cz,1 + \u03c3x2 cx,2\n+ \u03c3y2 cy,2 + \u03c3z2 cz,2 + \u03c3x1 \u03c3x2 cxx + \u03c3x1 \u03c3y2 cxy\n+ \u03c3x1 \u03c3z2 cxz + \u03c3y1 \u03c3x2 cyx + \u03c3y1 \u03c3y2 cyy + \u03c3y1 \u03c3z2 cyz\n+ \u03c3z1 \u03c3x2 czx + \u03c3z1 \u03c3y2 czy + \u03c3z1 \u03c3z2 czz .\n\n(1)\n\nFor convenience each term in the above total Hamiltonian\nis assumed to be time independent (this assumption can\nbe lifted). Here c0 represents the self-Hamiltonian of the\nbath, \u03c3xj , \u03c3yj , and \u03c3zj are the standard Pauli matrices for\nthe first (j = 1) or the second (j = 2) qubit, c\u03b3,j and\nc\u03b3\u03b4 (\u03b3, \u03b4 = x, y, z) represent arbitrary smooth bath operators. From Eq. (1), it is seen that in general, the bath\nmay interact with each individual qubit, or modulate the\nmutual interaction between the two qubits. The latter\nsituation naturally arises if, for example, the bath can\ninduce phonon excitations in a solid and hence perturb\nthe relative distance between the two qubits embeded in\nthe solid. The above total Hamiltonian is in the most\ngeneral form, because it can be regarded as a linear expansion over all possible 16 linearly independent basis\noperators operating on a four-dimensional Hilbert space,\nwith the expansion coefficients containing arbitrary bath\noperators. Note however, the frequency spectrum of the\nbath is assumed to have a hard cutoff so that the general\ntheory of UDD is applicable.\n\nThe basis operators used in the above-mentioned expansion can be taken as {Ri }i=1,2,*** ,16 = {\u03c3k \u2297 \u03c3l },\nwith \u03c3k , \u03c3l \u2208 {I, \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z } (I the unity operator for the\ntwo-qubit Hilbert space) and the orthogonality condition\nTr(Rj Rk ) = 4\u03b4jk . This choice of basis operators is rather\narbitrary. Purely for the sake of discussions below, we\nfind it convenient to define two new sets of basis operators. Let |0i, |1i, |2i, and |3i be the four orthogonal\nbasis states of the two-qubit Hilbert space, we define the\n\n\f3\nUDD was discovered. We can now split H into two parts,\n\nfollowing two new sets of basis operators,\n\nH = H0 + H1 ,\n10\nX\nWi Yi ,\nH0 =\n\nY1 = \u1ef81 = I,\nY2 = \u1ef82 = |0ih0| + |1ih1|,\n\nY3 = \u1ef83 = |2ih2| \u2212 |3ih3|,\n\nY4 = \u1ef84 = |2ih3|,\n\nH1 =\n\nY5 = \u1ef85 = |3ih2|,\n\nY7 = |1ih2|; \u1ef87 = [|0ih2| \u2212 |1ih2|],\n\nY8 = |2ih1|; \u1ef88 = [|2ih0| \u2212 |2ih1|],\n\nY9 = |1ih3|; \u1ef89 = [|0ih3| \u2212 |1ih3|],\n\n(2)\n\nHc =\n\nY11 = |0ih2|; \u1ef811 = [|0ih2| + |1ih2|],\n\nTj = T sin2 (\n\nY14 = |3ih0|; \u1ef814 = [|3ih0| + |3ih1|],\nY15 = \u1ef815 = |0ih1| + |1ih0|,\n\nY16 = \u1ef816 = \u2212i(|1ih0| \u2212 |0ih1|).\n\nThen our general total Hamiltonian H may be reexpressed as\n\ni=1\n\nW\u0303k \u1ef8k ,\n\n(6)\n\nLocking a known two-qubit state by an\nextended UDD scheme\n\nGiven a known but arbitrary two-qubit state, here assumed to be |0i without loss of generality, we first construct a control operator\n(4)\n\nwith X02 = I.

This is not an issue because their\nlinear superpositions still generate all possible Hermitian\noperators for a two-qubit system.\n\nB.\n\n\u03c0\u03b4(t \u2212 Tj )\n\nwith the UDD timing Tj given by\n\nY13 = |0ih3|; \u1ef813 = [|0ih3| + |1ih3|],\n\nWi Yi =\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nY12 = |2ih0|; \u1ef812 = [|2ih0| + |2ih1|],\n\nH=\n\n(5)\n\nwith the commuting relation [X0 , H0 ] = 0, and the anticommuting relation {X0 , H1 }+ = 0.

[22] the following control Hamiltonian describing a\nsequence of extended UDD \u03c0-pulses over a duration of\nT , i.e.,\n\nY10 = |3ih1|; \u1ef810 = [|3ih0| \u2212 |3ih1|],\n\n16\nX\n\nWi Yi ,\n\ni=11\n\nY6 = \u1ef86 = |0ih0| \u2212 |1ih1|,\n\n16\nX\n\ni=1\n16\nX\n\n\u00d7 e\u2212i[H0 +H1 ](T2 \u2212T1 ) (\u2212iX0 )\n\u00d7 e\u2212i[H0 +H1 ]T1 .\n\n(8)\n\nExploiting [H0 , X0 ] = 0 and {H1 , X0 }+ = 0, one can directly use the UDD universality proof developed by Yang\nand Liu [10, 19], yielding\neven\nUN (T ) = UN\n+ O(T N +1 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\neven\nUN\n= exp(\u2212iH0 T )\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n(\u2212i)2k \u22062k ,\n\n(10)\n\nk=0\n\nwith \u22062k only containing even powers of H1I (t), defined\nby H1I (t) \u2261 exp(iH0 t)H1 exp(\u2212iH0 t).\nBecause {H1 , X0 }+ = 0, one has {H1I (t), X0 }+ = 0.\nAs such, any even power of H1I (t) will commute with\nX0 , e.g, [H1I (t1 )H1I (t2 ), X0 ] = H1I (t1 ){H1I (t2 ), X0 }+ \u2212\n{H1I (t1 ), X0 }+ H1I (t2 ) = 0. This important observation\nindicates that \u22062k can be expanded as a linear superposition of all possible basis operators that commute with\nX0 . That is,\n\u22062k =\n\n10\nX\ni=1\n\nAi Yi ,\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nwhere Ai are the expansion coefficients containing bath\noperators. Clearly then, to the N th order, UN (T ) can\nbe expressed as a combination of Y1 , Y2 , * * * , Y10 only.\nUsing the closure of this set of operators, i.e.,\n!\n! 10\n10\n10\nX\nX\nX\nCl Yl ,\n(12)\nBk Yk =\nAi Yi\ni=1\n\nl=1\n\nk=1\n\nwe further obtain\nUDD-1\nUN (T ) = exp(\u2212iHeff\nT ) + O(T N +1 ),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\nUDD-1\nHeff\n=\n\n10\nX\n\nD1,i Yi ,\n\n(14)\n\ni=1\n\nwith D1,i being the expansion coefficients.\nThe outcome of applying a UDD sequence of X0 is now\nevident by comparing the original total Hamiltonian H\nin the absence of control with the effective Hamiltonian\nUDD-1\nrealized by UDD. In essence, the UDD sequence\nHeff\nbased on X0 efficiently removes the operators Y11 , Y12 ,\n* * * , Y16 from the initial generating algebra of H, thus\nsuppressing all possible coupling between the pre-chosen\nstate |0i and all other states. Therefore, given a known\nentangled state |0i, we can protect this state to the N th\norder with N [or (N + 1)] instantaneous control pulses,\na result analogous to single-qubit UDD.\nFor later use, we list below three key requirements in\nUDD-1\nachieving a UDD-reduced effective Hamiltonian Heff\nto the N th order, from a general Hamiltonian describing\ntwo qubits plus a bath:\n(i) Construction of a control operator (e.g., X0 ) whose\nsquare equals the unity operator. This control operator will be used to form a UDD sequence of N\ninstantaneous pulses [e.g., Eq. (6)].\n(ii) Separation of the bare system-bath Hamiltonian\ninto two terms, say H0 and H1 , with H0 commuting\nwith the control operator and H1 anti-commuting\nwith the control operator.\n(iii) Algebra closure of the operators forming H0 , which\nbecomes the generating algebra of a UDD-reduced\neffective Hamiltonian.\nIn our following considerations we will make a number of\nreferences to these three requirements.\nIII. PROTECTING UNKNOWN TWO-QUBIT\nENTANGLED STATES BY NESTED UDD\nA.\n\nFirst scheme for nesting three UDD layers\n\nThe X0 control operator in Sec. II is based on the\nknowledge that the state to be preserved is |0i. It is\n\neven more useful if we can develop a scheme to protect\nunknown two-qubit entangled states. To that end, let\nus assume that an unknown two-qubit state |\u03c8(0)i is a\nsuperposition of two orthogonal basis states, e.g., |0i and\n|1i. Though our considerations below are general, to be\nspecific we assume |0i \u2261 | \u2191\u2191i, and |1i \u2261 | \u2193\u2193i, where\n\u2191 and \u2193 represent spin-up and spin-down states of each\nqubit. The unknown two-qubit state to be protected can\nbe written as\n|\u03c8(0)i = \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i\n= \u03b1| \u2191\u2191i + \u03b2| \u2193\u2193i,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the two unknown coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 satisfy |\u03b1|2 +\n|\u03b2|2 = 1 at time zero. Can we efficiently protect such type\nof unknown entangled states by further extending UDD?\nNote that this problem is different from a single-qubit\ncase because the population can leak out from the initial\ntwo-dimensional subspace.\nWe use \u03c1(t) to represent the total density matrix of\nthe system and the bath at time t, evolving from a direct product state of |\u03c8(0)i and some initial state of the\nbath. The protection of the state |\u03c8(0)i requires to freeze\nmultiple coherence properties, i.e., diagonal populations\nTr[\u03c1(t)| \u2191\u2191ih\u2191\u2191 |] \u2248 |\u03b1|2 and Tr[\u03c1(t)| \u2193\u2193ih\u2193\u2193 |] \u2248 |\u03b2|2 ,\nas well as the off-diagonal phase property Tr[\u03c1(t)| \u2191\u2191ih\u2193\u2193\n|] \u2248 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 . This motivates us to extend the UDD nesting scheme in Ref. [23], where both single-qubit population relaxation and single-qubit transverse dephasing\nare suppressed in a near-optimal fashion. Certainly, our\nproblem here is more demanding: in single-qubit systems with a two-dimensional Hilbert space, the locking\nof one projection probability onto one basis state automatically freezes the projection probability onto a second basis state, whereas here the locking of the diagonal probabilities at |\u03b1|2 and |\u03b2|2 should be respectively\nachieved by control pulses. Given that two layers of UDD\nsequences are needed for complete single-qubit decoherence control in Ref. [23], it is a natural guess that we will\nat least need three layers of nested UDD sequences.\nWe can now directly make use of our results in the\nprevious section. In the first step, we lock the diagonal\nproperty Tr[\u03c1(t)| \u2191\u2191ih\u2191\u2191 |]. This can be achieved by considering an innermost layer of UDD sequence of X0 , such\nthat all possible coupling between |0i and all other orthogonal states can be efficiently removed. Doing so, we\nUDD-1\nreduce H to Heff\nto the N th order, as elaborated in\nSec. II. The population on state |0i is hence locked.\nIn the second step, we treat a decoherence control\nUDD-1\nproblem for the effective Hamiltonian Heff\n. We asUDD-1\nsume that Heff\nresulting from the innermost layer of\nUDD is a sufficiently smooth function of time, such that\nUDD-1\na second layer of UDD can be applied to Heff\n. Note\nhowever, though this is a natural assumption and Ref.\n[15] reasoned about the smoothness of analogous UDDreduced effective Hamiltonians, some counter examples\nmight exist [19]. With this smoothness assumption exercised with caution, we now introduce a second UDD layer\nto lock the second diagonal property Tr[\u03c1(t)| \u2193\u2193ih\u2193\u2193 |].\n\n\f5\nAs is clear from Sec. II, in order to remove all possible\ncouplings between |1i and all other states, one may apply the control operator X1 = 2|1ih1| \u2212 I with X12 = I.\nUDD-1\nTo examine if this is feasible, we decompose Heff\ninto\ntwo terms, i.e.,\nUDD-1\nHeff\n=\n\n=\n\n10\nX\n\nD1,i Yi\ni=1\nUDD-1\nHeff,0\n+\n\nUDD-1\nHeff,1\n,\n\nUDD-3\nHeff\n=\n\n(16)\n\nwith\nUDD-1\nHeff,0\n\u2261\nUDD-1\nHeff,1\n\u2261\n\n6\nX\n\ni=1\n10\nX\n\nD1,i Yi ;\nD1,i Yi .\n\n(17)\n\ni=7\n\nUDD-1\nUDD-1\nBecause [Heff,0\n, X1 ] = 0 and {Heff,1\n, X1 }+ = 0, it\nUDD-1\nis seen that Heff\nand X1 guarantee requirement (ii)\noutlined in Sec. II. Finally, it is straightforward to see\nthat the operators Yi , i = 1 \u2212 6 form a closed algebra [requirement (iii) above]. We hence expect that if a second\nlayer of UDD sequence of X1 is applied, to the N th order\nUDD-1\nthe dynamics of Heff\nunder the second control layer\nbecomes that of a simpler effective Hamiltonian (denoted\nUDD-2\nHeff\n) generated by a further reduced algebra. That\nis,\n\nUDD-2\nHeff\n=\n\n6\nX\n\nD2,i Yi ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere D2,i represent the expansion coefficients due to\ntwo UDD layers.\nExamining the self-closed set of operators that form\nUDD-2\n, one sees that only the component D2,6 Y6 =\nHeff\nD2,6 [|0ih0| \u2212 |1ih1|] can affect the intial superposition\nstate \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i. Further, this Y6 component does not\nchange the populations on states |0i and |1i, so it represents a pure dephasing mechanism. To efficiently suppress this pure dephasing, we now consider a third, outUDD-2\nermost UDD layer. Assuming again that Heff\nis sufficiently smooth for UDD to apply, we introduce the following \"phase\" control operator\nX\u03c6 \u2261 [|0i + |1i][h0| + h1|] \u2212 I,\n\n(19)\n\nUDD-2\ninto two terms, we\nwith X\u03c62 = I. Separating Heff\nobtain\nUDD-2\nUDD-2\nUDD-2\nHeff\n= Heff,0\n+ Heff,1\n,\n\n(20)\n\nwith\n5\nX\n\n5\nX\n\nD3,i Yi ,\n\n(22)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere D3,i represent the expansion coefficients due to\nthree UDD layers. Referring to the subspace spanned by\nUDD-3\n|0i and |1i, Heff\nonly contains an identity operator for\nthat subspace. Hence any unknown initial superposition\nstate \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i is well preserved to the N th order.\nIn terms of step-by-step reduction of the generating algebra associated with the effective Hamiltonians at each\nlevel, the following chart summarizes how our nesting\nscheme reduces a general total Hamiltonian to a much\nsimplified form:\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 16\n\u21d3X0 , UDD-1\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 10\n\u21d3X1 ,UDD-2\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 6\n\u21d3X\u03c6 ,UDD-3\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 5 .\n\ni=1\n\nUDD-2\nHeff,0\n=\n\nUDD-2\nUDD-2\nInterestingly, [Heff,0\n, X\u03c6 ] = 0 and {Heff,1\n, X\u03c6 } + =\n0. Further, the operators Yi , i = 1 \u2212 5 form a closed\nalgebra. All the three key requirements for UDD are\nagain met for this outermost layer. The final reduced\neffective Hamiltonian after three layers of UDD is hence\nformed by five operators, i.e.,\n\nD2,i Yi ;\n\ni=1\n\nUDD-2\nHeff,1\n= D2,6 Y6 .\n\n(21)\n\nThe operators inside each box represent the elements of\nthe generating algebra before or after a certain layer of\nUDD.\nFor completeness, we also explicitly present here the\ntiming of the control pulses within each UDD layer. In\nparticular, the control operator X0 in the innermost layer\nis applied at\n\u0012\n\u0013\nl\u03c0\nTj,k,l = Tj,k + (Tj,k+1 \u2212 Tj,k ) sin2\n, (23)\n2N + 2\nwhere Tj,k is the UDD timing for X1 in the middle layer.\nTj,k is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\u03c0\n2\nTj,k = Tj + (Tj+1 \u2212 Tj ) sin\n,\n(24)\n2N + 2\nwhere Tj represents the timing for X\u03c6 in the outermost\nlayer and it is already given by Eq. (7). Similar to singlequbit cases, for each layer, if N is odd then an additional\ncontrol operator is applied at the end of each sequence.\nOverall, N 3 [or (N + 1)3 ] control pulses are applied to\nachieve decoherence suppression to the N th order. Because states |0i and |1i play a similar role here, our analysis above equally applies if X1 and X0 are exchanged.\n\n\f6\nTABLE I: Explicit construction of control operators for\nnesting three layers of UDD sequences in order to protect\nunknown two-qubit entangled states \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i, with\n|0i = | \u2191\u2191i and |1i = | \u2193\u2193i.\n\nUDD-1\nH\u0303eff\n\nConstructed Operator\nExplicit Form\n\u0001\n1 2\nX0\n\u03c3z \u03c3z + \u03c3z1 + \u03c3z2 \u2212 I /2\n\u0001\nX1\n\u03c3z1 \u03c3z2 \u2212 \u03c3z1 \u2212 \u03c3z2 \u2212 I /2\n\u0001\nX\u03c6\n\u03c3x1 \u03c3x2 \u2212 \u03c3y1 \u03c3y2 + \u03c3z1 \u03c3z2 \u2212 I /2\nX0,1\n\u03c3z1 \u03c3z2\n\nAt this point an interesting question arises. That is,\ndoes the ordering of the three nested UDD sequences\nmatter or not? To answer this question let us first exchange the ordering of the two sequences of X0 and\nX\u03c6 , such that X\u03c6 is in the innermost layer and X0\nis in the outermost layer. We denote this ordering as\nX0 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 . In the following we shall stick to this\nconvention for ordering, i.e., an operator appearing at\nthe rightmost (leftmost) will be placed in the innermost\n(outermost) layer. Because the X\u03c6 layer is now operating directly on the bare Hamiltonian H, we re-partition\nH in Eq. (3) into the following two terms, i.e.,\n!\n5\n10\nX\nX\nH =\nW\u0303k \u1ef8k +\nW\u0303k \u1ef8k + W\u030315 \u1ef815\nk=7\n\n+ W\u03036 \u1ef86 + W\u030316 \u1ef816 +\n\n14\nX\n\nk=11\n\nW\u0303k \u1ef8k\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere operators \u1ef8k are defined in Eq. (2). The first term\nin the above equation commutes with X\u03c6 , whereas the\nsecond term anti-commutes with X\u03c6 . All the operators\ncontained in the first term form a closed algebra. The\ninnermost UDD sequence of X\u03c6 hences yields an effective\nHamiltonian\nUDD-1\nH\u0303eff\n=\n\n5\nX\ni=1\n\nD\u03031,i \u1ef8i +\n\n10\nX\n\n=\n\n\u2032\nD1,i\nYi\n\ni=1\n10\nX\n\n+\n\n14\nX\n\n\u2032\nD1,i\nYi\n\ni=11\n\u2032\nD1,i\nYi\n\n+\n\nD\u03031,i \u1ef8i + D\u03031,15 \u1ef815\n\n!\n\n\u2032\nD1,15\nY15\n\ni=7\n\nWrong ordering of three UDD layers\n\nk=1\n\n5\nX\n\n+\n\nTo realize such a UDD nesting scheme with this highorder decoherence suppression, the involved two-qubit\ncontrol operators are nonlocal control operators in general. Taking |0i = | \u2191\u2191i and |1i = | \u2193\u2193i as an example,\nTable I lists the three control operators (another operator\nto be explained later) in terms of the familiar Pauli matrices. The identity operator in the expressions for X0 ,\nX1 and X\u03c6 in Table I is not important. Experimentally,\nrealizing such two-qubit control operators is analogous\nto realizing quantum computation in a two-qubit system.\nThe true challenge might lie in realizing a sufficient speed\nof such two-qubit operations.\nB.\n\nwhere D\u03031,i are the expansion coefficients. To consider\nUDD-1\nthe second UDD layer, we rewrite H\u0303eff\nin terms of\nYk , i.e.,\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\n\u2032\nwhere D1,i\nis connected with D\u03031,k via a simple relation\nbetween Yi and \u1ef8i [see Eq. (2)].\nThe middle layer of UDD sequence would be based\non the control operator X1 . Among those basis operaUDD-1\n, X1 commutes with those in the\ntors that form H\u0303eff\nfirst line of Eq. (27) and anti-commutes with those in\nthe second line of Eq. (27). This indicates that the final\nevolution operator associated with this UDD layer can\nbe cast into a form similar to Eq. (10). We next investigate if the key requirement (iii) of UDD can be satisfied.\nInterestingly and somewhat unexpectedly, this is not the\ncase: operators Yi with i = 1, 2, * * * , 5 together with Yi\nwith i = 11 \u2212 14 cannot form a closed algebra. For example, 2Y11 Y12 \u2212 Y2 will yield Y6 , which is already outside\nthis collection of basis operators. As a result, the application of this second control layer will not yield a further\nreduced effective Hamiltonian. Such a nesting scheme\nthen breaks down due to its wrong ordering! Indeed, in\nthe correctly ordered case, the dephasing operator Y6 will\nbe suppressed by X\u03c6 , but here it resurfaces (from even\npowers of those operators that commute with X1 ) after\nthe X\u03c6 layer is already applied.\nNote however, due to this wrong ordering, the undesired operators (such as Y6 that cannot be suppressed by\nthe outermost X0 layer) reemerge from multiplications of\na set of basis operators. We hence intuitively expect its\nimpact on decoherence control to be at least a secondorder effect. We will come back to this when discussing\nour numerical results.\nOne may wonder what happens to other ordering? Because states |0i and |1i play the same role here, there is\nonly one non-equivalent ordering left, i.e., X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X0\n(or equivalently, X0 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 ). The effective Hamiltonian after the innermost layer\nP10of UDD sequence is hence\nUDD-1\nstill given by Heff\n=\ni=1 D1,i Yi . Since the next\nUDD-1\nlayer of control is X\u03c6 , one checks if Heff\ncan be decomposed into two terms in accord with the properties\nof X\u03c6 [to fulfill requirement (ii) outlined above]. Interestingly, though this procedure can be easily done in the\nentire two-qubit operator space, it cannot be done here\nUDD-1\nwithin the reduced generating algebra of Heff\n. That\nUDD-1\n,\nis, among the set of basis operators that form Heff\nsome operators or their arbitrary combinations are neither commuting nor anti-commuting with X\u03c6 . For example,\n\ni=7\n\n(26)\n\n[Y7 , X\u03c6 ] 6= 0; {Y7 , X\u03c6 }+ 6= 0.\n\n(28)\n\n\f7\nSo even without checking if there is a self-closed set of\noperators that commute with X\u03c6 , it is already seen that\nthe nesting scheme breaks down directly in this ordering. Thus, out of three non-equivalent ordering of the\nthree control operators considered here, only the ordering advocated in the previous subsection may achieve\nhigh-order protection of two-qubit states.\nFrom a more general perspective, the dependence of\nthe controlled dynamics on the ordering of the three UDD\nlayers can be explained as follows. Consider a particular\ntime interval \u2206T for a time-independent Hamiltonian H,\nduring which each of the two control operators A and B\n(A2 = 1 and B 2 = 1) are applied twice with a certain\nordering. If B is nested inside, the associated unitary\nevolution is given by\nUA\u2212B = ABe\u2212iH\u2206T BA = e\u2212i[(AB)H(BA)]\u2206T ;\n\n(29)\n\nwhereas for the other ordering, the unitary evolution is\ngiven by\nUB\u2212A = BAe\u2212iH\u2206T AB = e\u2212i[(BA)H(AB)]\u2206T .\n\n(30)\n\nAs seen from the right hand side of Eqs. (29) and (30),\nthe two ordering leads to two effective Hamiltonians\n(AB)H(BA) and (BA)H(AB). In general these two effective Hamiltonians are different, thus giving rise to the\nordering dependence. Note however, if for a concerned\nHilbert subspace AB = BA or AB = \u2212BA, i.e., if the\ntwo control operators commute or anti-commute, then\nthese two effective Hamiltonians are identical and hence\nthe ordering dependence no longer exists. This further\nexplains why we cannot exchange the ordering between\nX\u03c6 and X0 or the ordering between X\u03c6 and X1 , but can\nexchange the ordering between X0 and X1 .\nC.\n\nAlternative Nesting Scheme\n\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 16\n\u21d3X0,1 , UDD-1\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 6; Y15 , Y16\n\u21d3X1 ,UDD-2\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 6\n\u21d3X\u03c6 ,UDD-3\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 5 .\nFor the ordering of X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X0,1 , we have\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 16\n\nFor the two-dimensional subspace spanned by states\n|0i and |1i, any two orthogonal states |0\u2032 i and |1\u2032 i can\nbe adopted to construct analogous control operators X0\u2032 ,\nX1\u2032 , and X\u03c6\u2032 for three UDD layers. Therefore, when\nit comes to an actual implementation, there are infinite\npossibilities to realize three nested UDD layers in order\nto protect an unknown entangled state in that subspace.\nEven for fixed basis states |0i and |1i, the nesting\nscheme with the right ordering analyzed above is not the\nonly solution. Consider the following control operator\nX0,1 = 2[|0ih0| + |1ih1|] \u2212 I = X0 + X1 + I\n\nThe ordering of X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X0,1 is studied first. It\nis found that each of the three UDD layers satisfies the\nthree requirement outlined in Sec. II and hence yields a\nsimple effective Hamiltonian to the N th order. Qualitatively, it is also obvious why this scheme is expected to\nwork. The innermost layer effectively lock the population\nin a two-dimenional Hilbert subspace. Then, in essence,\nthe next two layers are similar to those in single-qubit\ntwo-layer UDD [23], insofar as a second layer locks one\npopulation and the outermost layer freezes the relative\nphase between the two projection amplitudes. Extending this analogy, it is expected that the ordering of the\nmiddle layer and the outermost layer can be exchanged\n(indeed, the associated control operators anti-commute\nin the two-dimensional subspace). This can be more formally analyzed by working out the detailed algebra layerby-layer. In particular, for the ordering of X\u03c6 \u2212X1 \u2212X0,1 ,\nthe generating algebra for the effective Hamiltonians after each control layer reduces in the following fashion:\n\n(31)\n\n2\nwith X0,1\n= I. The explicit form of X0,1 is also given in\nTable I. Following the analysis in Sec. II, it is straightforward to confirm that a UDD sequence of X0,1 can efficiently freeze the total population in the two-dimensional\nsubspace spanned by |0i and |1i. We can now construct\nan alternative nesting scheme using X0,1 , X\u03c6 and X1 (or\nX0 ).\n\n\u21d3X0,1 , UDD-1\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 6; Y15 , Y16\n\u21d3X\u03c6 ,UDD-2\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 5; Y15\n\u21d3X1 ,UDD-3\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 5 .\nAs seen above, both nesting strategies are successful and\nin the end the same generating algebra for the final effective Hamiltonian is reached.\nCan we place a sequence of X0,1 in the middle layer\ninstead? For the ordering of X\u03c6 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X1 , since the\npopulation on state |1i is already locked by the inner\nmost layer, the role of the second layer is equivalent to\nfurther locking the population on state |0i, thus playing a\nsimilar role as X0 . The outermost layer then freezes the\n\n\f8\n0\n\nrelative phase between the two projection amplitudes,\nanalogous to the case of X\u03c6 \u2212 X0 \u2212 X1 . In this sense, the\nordering of X\u03c6 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X1 does not provide anything\nnew. Indeed, based on the discussion at the end of the\nlast subsection, because [X0,1 , X1 ] = 0, their ordering is\nexpected to be exchangeable.\nConsider then the other ordering X1 \u2212X0,1 \u2212X\u03c6 (which\nis also equivalent to X0 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 ). In this case, the\neffective Hamiltonian reduced by the innermost layer is\nUDD-1\ngiven by H\u0303eff\nin Eq. (27). To analyze the effect of the\nUDD-1\nsecond layer, we re-split H\u0303eff\nin Eq.

As an interesting outcome, now the set of operators that commute with the\nsecond-layer control operator also form a closed algebra,\nthus paving the way for the third UDD layer. Indeed,\nthe outermost X0 layer further reduces the algebra by\nremoving the Y15 component and hence yields an effective Hamiltonian seen before. Summarizing, the explicit\nalgebra reduction route for X1 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 becomes\n\nX \u2212X \u2212X\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\nN\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Averaged trace distance D between initial and final two-qubit states in the presence of three-layer\nnested UDD.

For reasons analogous\nto our first nesting scheme using X0 , X1 and X\u03c6 , such\ntype of ordering cannot simplify the effective Hamiltonians layer-by-layer. This concludes this subsection.\n\nD.\n\nNumerical study\n\nSimilar to our previous work [22], we use a five-spin\nsystem to carry out simple numerical experiments. Two\nof the five spins are identified as our two-qubit system,\nand the other three spins are regarded as the bath. To\navoid assumptions about how the system is coupled to the\nbath, we work with the following general total Hamilto-\n\nnian\nH =\n\n5\nX\n\nX\n\nb\u03b3,m \u03c3\u03b3m\n\nm=1 \u03b3={x,y,z}\n\n+\n\n5\nX\n\nX\n\n5\nX\n\nX\n\nm n\ncmn\n\u03b3\u03b4 \u03c3\u03b3 \u03c3\u03b4 (33)\n\nm=1 \u03b3={x,y,z} n>m \u03b4={x,y,z}\n\nin dimensionless units, where all the coefficients b\u03b3,m and\ncmn\n\u03b3\u03b4 are randomly sampled from the range [\u22120.5, 0.5].\nWe average our results over ten random realizations of\nthis five-spin system-bath Hamiltonian. In addition, to\ndemonstrate that our approach does not depend on the\nactual form of an initial superposition state \u03b1| \u2191\u2191i+\u03b2| \u2193\u2193\ni, we further average our results over ten initial states\nwith randomly sampled coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 under the\nconstraint |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1.\nFigure 1 depicts the averaged trace distance (denoted\nD) between the system's reduced density matrix at time\nt = 0.1 and its initial state, for N = 1 \u2212 10. Different\nordering of three UDD sequences X0 , X1 , and X\u03c6 are\nplotted together for comparison. Consider first the two\ncases (bottom two curves) with the correct ordering, i.e.,\nX\u03c6 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X0 and X\u03c6 \u2212 X0 \u2212 X1 . For these two cases a\nremarkably high fidelity is achieved in locking the initial\n\n\f9\n\nAs a comparison with a conventional dynamical decoupling approach based on control pulses equally spaced\nin time, Fig. 2 presents the parallel results if, within\neach layer, the control operator is applied periodically.\nClearly, in this case, irrespective of the ordering of the\ncontrol operators, the performance of decoherence control for N = 10 in all cases is about nine orders of magnitude worse than the best two cases in Fig. 1. It is\nalso observed that the D values are very weakly dependent on N . Results here remind us that in addition to\nthe ordering of the three layers, the timing of the control\noperators is essential.\nFinally, results for an alternative UDD nesting scheme\nbased on X0,1 , X1 , and X\u03c6 are shown in Fig. 3. The top\ntwo curves are for two incorrect ordering X0,1 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X\u03c6\nand X0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 , with their D values saturating\nat about 10\u22124 as N increases. It is noted that the\nX0,1 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 curve is similar to the X0 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X\u03c6\ncase in Fig. 1. This is understandable because the underlying mechanism for unsuccessful nesting is the same.\nHowever, the X0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 case here has better performance than the X0 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 case in Fig. 1. This\nis interesting because in both cases, the effective Hamiltonian reduced from the innermost layer does not satisfy\nrequirement (ii) for the second layer. Clearly then, for\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nX0\u2212X\u03c6\u2212X1\n\nD\n\nunknown superposition state. For N = 10 (totally N 3\nUDD pulses), D already reaches the 10\u221210 level. The almost linear scaling of log(D) vs N is consistent with the\nexpectation that the extent of the decoherence suppression for a working nesting scheme is to the N th order.\nTurning to the top two flat curves associated with the\nwrong ordering X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X0 and X0 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 . Their\nD values do not decrease with N and stay at about 10\u22121 .\nTherefore, for these two cases the three-layer nested UDD\ndoes not work at all due to the wrong ordering. This directly confirms our early insights into the issue. In particular, from the algebra considerations we observe that\nfor the incorrect ordering here, the second layer of UDD\ndirectly breaks down because the effective Hamiltonian\nreduced from the inner most layer does not meet requirement (ii).\nStill referring to Fig. 1, let us now discuss the middle\ncurves associated with another type of wrong ordering,\ni.e., X1 \u2212 X0 \u2212 X\u03c6 and X0 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 . It is seen that\ntheir D values first decrease and then tend to saturate\nas N increases. The smallest D values for N = 10 is\nabout 10\u22124 , which is about six orders of magnitude larger\nthan in previous correctly ordered cases. However, this\nperformance is at the same time better than the top two\nflat curves. As such, the wrong ordering here represents a\nweak deviation from an ideal nesting. This is consistent\nwith our early intuition that for the current ordering,\nthe UDD nesting scheme breaks down due to a highorder effect, i.e., the non-closure of a set of operators\nthat commute with the control operator in the middle\nlayer.\n\nX1\u2212X\u03c6\u2212X0\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nX0\u2212X1\u2212X\u03c6\nX1\u2212X0\u2212X\u03c6\nX\u03c6\u2212X0\u2212X1\nX \u2212X \u2212X\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\nN\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Same as in Fig. 1, except that the control pulses are applied periodically within each control layer.\nNote that the scale of the plotted D values is many orders of\nmagnitude different from that in Fig. 1.\n\nthe outermost layer, a sequence of X0,1 turns out to be\nsuperior to a sequence of X0 . This is somewhat expected\nbecause X0,1 in the outermost layer can still freeze the total population in the two-dimensional subspace whereas\nX0 cannot.\nAll other four curves in Fig. 3 display a roughly linear\nscaling of log(D) vs N , indicating the success of threelayer nested UDD. Indeed, the layer ordering associated\nwith these curves is all predicted to be correct in our\ntheoretical analysis above. Interestingly, for fixed N ,\nthe performance for the ordering of X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X0,1 or\nX\u03c6 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X1 can differ from that for X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X0,1 or\nX1 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 by about two orders of magnitude. Comparing with the best performance here with that in Fig.\n1, a difference about two orders of magnitude is also observed. These numerical details indicate that even with\nthe same scaling with N , the actual performance of a\ncorrectly ordered three-layer UDD may depend on the\nspecific algebra reduction route. More insights into this\nintriguing finding might help to further understand the\nnature of decoherence dynamics under nested multi-layer\nUDD.\n\nIV.\n\nFROM THREE-LAYER UDD TO\nFOUR-LAYER UDD\n\nWe are optimistic that for N \u223c 10 a total of N 3 UDD\ncontrol pulses as proposed in this work might be achievable in some systems in the near future. If this is the\n\n\f10\n0\n\nSo what happens to the first subspace also applies to the\nsecond subspace. Their physical meaning is also clear: Z1\nlocks the total population within each subspace spanned\nby |0i and |1i or by |2i and |3i, Z2 locks the individual populations on each state, and Z3 finally suppresses\nthe pure dephasing within each of the two subspaces\nof dimensional two. Therefore, this symmetry-adapted\nthree-layer UDD scheme should have more efficiency in\nreducing the algebra layer-by-layer. For the ordering of\nZ3 \u2212 Z2 \u2212 Z1 , the associated algebra reduction route is\nfound to be:\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\nD\n\n10\n\nX0,1\u2212X1\u2212X\u03c6\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\nX \u2212X \u2212X\n\u03c6\n\n0,1\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n1\n\nX\u03c6\u2212X0,1\u2212X1\n\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 16\n\nX \u2212X \u2212X\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\n0,1\n\n\u21d3Z1 , UDD-1\n\nX \u2212X \u2212X\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\n\u221212\n\n10\n\n0,1\n\nX1\u2212X0,1\u2212X\u03c6\n\nYi , i = 1, 2, * * * , 6; Y15 , Y16\n\u21d3Z2 ,UDD-2\n\n\u221214\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\nN\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Same as in Fig. 1, except that the three\ncontrol operators used in the three UDD layers are now X0,1 ,\nX1 , and X\u03c6 . Top two curves are for X0,1 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 and\nX0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X1 ; bottom two curves are for X1 \u2212 X\u03c6 \u2212 X0,1\nand X1 \u2212 X0,1 \u2212 X\u03c6 .\n\ncase, then as the next step one wonders if there exist\neven better schemes, at least in theory. In particular, as\na result of three correctly ordered UDD layers, the generUDD-3\nating algebra for the final effective Hamiltonian Heff\ncontains only five operators. Can we construct better\ncontrol operators to reduce the algebra more rapidly?\nCan we even consider one more UDD layer to remove all\npossible system-environment coupling?\nAs a brief summary of our latest progress along these\ntwo questions, we first note that, the two nesting schemes\nproposed in Sec. III treat the subspace spanned by |0i\nand |1i differently than the subspace spanned by |2i and\n|3i. Indeed, we have assumed that the initial state is a\nsuperposition of states |0i and |1i. If the initial state\nis totally unknown, then it is best to construct control\noperators that are symmetric with respect to the two\nsubspaces. Upon completion of our studies of the two\nnesting schemes discussed in Sec. III, we find that the\nfollowing three symmetry-adapted control operators can\nform another nesting scheme for three-layer UDD, i.e.,\nZ1 \u2261 |0ih0| + |1ih1| \u2212 |2ih2| \u2212 |3ih3| = X0,1\nZ2 \u2261 |0ih0| \u2212 |1ih1| + |2ih2| \u2212 |3ih3|\nZ3 \u2261 |0ih1| + |1ih0| + |2ih3| + |3ih2|.\n(34)\nThat is, for each UDD layer, the three key requirements\nof UDD outlined in Sec. II are satisfied. Dramatically,\nthe form of the three control operators Z1 , Z2 , and Z3\nis explicitly symmetric with respect to an exchange between the (|0i, |1i) subspace and the (|2i, |3i) subspace.\n\nY1 , Y2 , Y3 , Y6\n\u21d3Z3 ,UDD-3\nY1 , Y2 .\nUDD-3\nThe final effective Hamiltonian Heff;Z\nafter such three\nUDD layers is hence a combination of only two operators: Y2 and the unity operator Y1 (or equivalently,\n|2ih2| + |3ih3| and Y1 ). Note that the dephasing between the (|0i, |1i) subspace and the (|2i, |3i) subspace\nis still not suppressed. Perhaps even more remarkable,\nfor these three symmetry-adapted control operators, they\neither commute or anti-commute, and consequently different orderings of Z1 , Z2 and Z3 can produce the same\nfinal generating algebra.\nUDD-3\nOne can further rewrite Heff;Z\nin a more enlightening\nand symmetric form, i.e.,\nUDD-3\nZ\nHeff;Z\n= D3,1\nI\nZ\n+ D3,2\n[|0ih0| + |1ih1| \u2212 |2ih2| \u2212 |3ih3|].(35)\n\nThis finally brings us to our last theoretical question:\nUDD-3\ncan we further reduce Heff;Z\nby adding one more UDD\nlayer? Our answer is yes in theory. This is somewhat\nobvious if one introduces the fourth control operator\nZ4 \u2261 |0ih2| + |2ih0| + |1ih3| + |3ih1|\nZ42\n\n(36)\n\nwith\n= 1. Clearly, because Z4 anti-commutes with\nthe second operator in Eq. (35) and commutes with the\nidentity operator, the fourth UDD layer based on Z4\nwill finally yield an effective Hamiltonian as a certain\nbath operator multiplied by a unity-operator in the fourdimensional Hilbert space for a two-qubit system! So\nit is theoretically possible to protect a totally unknown\ntwo-qubit state against most general system-environment\ncoupling, using about N 4 control pulses in total. Further,\nsince this four-layer scheme is intended to lock any twoqubit state, one may now arbitrarily choose the four orthogonal basis states in order to simplify the four control\n\n\f11\noperators (this is not allowed in three-layer UDD because\na two-dimensional subspace is chosen beforehand). In\nparticular, if we consider a new set of basis states different than above, e.g., |0i = | \u2191\u2191i, |1i = | \u2191\u2193i, |2i = | \u2193\u2191i,\nand |3i = | \u2193\u2193i, then one obtains Z1 = \u03c3z1 , Z2 = \u03c3z2 ,\nZ3 = \u03c3x2 , and Z4 = \u03c3x1 , which are only local control\noperators in this new representation. Such a four-layer\nsolution is also numerically checked.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWith both theoretical analysis and numerical study,\nwe have shown how nested three-layer UDD can protect\nunknown two-qubit entangled states as a superposition\nof two known basis states, to the N th order with about\nN 3 control pulses, without assuming a specific form of\nsystem-environment coupling. This is of much interest\nto current theoretical investigations of entanglement protection. As a remarkable side result, it is found that the\nordering of the three UDD layers can be a crucial factor.\nNumerical results support our theoretical considerations.\nGiven the theoretical feasibility of extending UDD beyond single-qubit systems, decoherence control via nested\nUDD should be of experimental interest as well. Though\na rigorous mathematical foundation for nested UDD is\nstill under development [19, 25], the success of threelayer UDD demonstrated here in two-qubit systems fur-\n\n[1] K. Zyczkowski, P.

Our approach can\nalso be extended to protect an unknown superposition of\ntwo known basis states in an arbitrary multi-level system.\nAs a final extension, in Sec. IV we also discussed how\na totally unknown two-qubit entangle state can be protected by applying four layers of UDD sequences that\ninvolve local operations only. Applying N 4 pulses can be\nhighly demanding in experiments, but the existence of\nsuch a theoretical solution should offer a useful reference\npoint for future studies of entanglement protection. On\nthe other hand, it becomes interesting to compare our\nmain topic of this work, i.e., three-layer UDD, with the\nultimate four-layer solution. The four-layer solution can\nbe realized by local control operators but the required\nnumber of pulses may present experimental difficulties.\nBy treating a particular class of two-qubit states, threelayer UDD can achieve entanglement protection of unknown states using much less control pulses, with the\nprice that rapid nonlocal operations are required.\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank the Faculty of Science, National University\nof Singapore, for the \"Special Program in Science\" that\nhelped to launch this research project.
