The associative\ndelusion means such a situation, when associative properties of human thinking\nactuate incorrectly, and the natural phenomenon is attributed by properties alien to\nit. Usually one physical phenomenon is attributed by properties of other physical\nphenomenon, or properties of the physical phenomenon description are attributed\nto the physical phenomenon in itself. Let us illustrate this in a simple example,\nwhich is perceived now as a grotesque.\nIt is known that ancient Egyptians believed that all rivers flow towards the\nNorth. This delusion seems now to be nonsense. But many years ago it had weighty\nfoundation. The ancient Egyptians lived on a vast flat plane and knew only one\nriver the Nile, which flowed exactly towards the North and had no tributaries on\nthe Egyptian territory. The North direction was a preferred direction for ancient\nEgyptians who observed motion of heavenly bodies regularly. It was direction toward\nthe fixed North star. They did not connect direction of the river flow with the plane\nslope, as we do now. They connected the direction of the river flow with the preferred\nspatial direction towards the North. We are interested now what kind of mistake\nmade ancient Egyptians, believing that all rivers flow towards the North, and how\ncould they to overcome their delusion.\nTheir delusion was not a logical mistake, because the logic has no relation to this\nmistake. The delusion was connected with associative property of human thinking,\nwhen the property P is attributed to the object O on the basis that in all known cases\nthe property P accompanies the object O. Such an association may be correct or\nnot. If it is erroneous, as in the given case, it is very difficult to discover the mistake.\nAt any rate it is difficult to discover the mistake by means of logic, because such\nassociations appear before the logical analysis, and the subsequent logical analysis\nis carried out on the basis of the existing associations. Let us imagine that in the\ncourse of a travel an ancient Egyptian scientist arrived the Tigris, which is the\nnearest to Egypt river. He discovers a water stream which flows, first, not directly\nand, second, not towards the North. Does he discover his delusion? Most likely not.\nAt any rate not at once. He starts to think that the water stream, flowing before\nhim, is not a river. A ground for such a conclusion is his primordial belief that\n\"real\" river is to flow, first, directly and, second, towards the North. Besides, the\nNile was very important in the life of ancient Egyptians, and they were often apt to\nidolize the Nile. The delusion about direction of the river flow could be overcame\nonly after that, when one has discovered sufficiently many different rivers, flowing\ntowards different directions, and the proper analysis of this circumstance has been\ncarried out.\nThus, to overcome the associating delusion, it is not sufficient to present another object O, which has not the property P , because one may doubt of whether\nthe presented object is to be classified really as the object O. Another attendant\ncircumstances are also possible.\n2\n\n\fIf the established association between the object and its property is erroneous,\none can speak on associative delusion or on associative prejudice. The usual method\nof the associative delusions overcoming is a consideration of a wider set of phenomena, where the established association between the property P and the object O\nmay appear to be violated, and the associative delusion is discovered.\nIn this paper the associative delusions in natural sciences, mainly in physics\nare discussed. The associative delusions (AD) are very stable. If they have been\nestablished, they are overcame very difficultly, because they cannot be disproved\nlogically. But there is an additional complication. The usual mistake is overcame\neasily by the scientific community, as soon as it has been overcame by one of its\nmembers. The corresponding article is published, and the scientific community\ntakes it into account, and the mistake is considered to be corrected.\nA different situation arises with the associative delusions (AD). Discovery of the\nassociative delusion (AD), and publication of corresponding article do not lead to\nacknowledgment of AD as a delusion or mistake. The scientific community continue\nto insist on the statement, that the considered in the article AD is not a mistake\nin reality, and that the author of this paper himself makes a mistake. A long\ncontroversy arises. Sometimes it leads to a conflict, as in the case of conflict between\nthe Ptolemaic doctrine and that of Copernicus. Finally, the truth celebrates victory,\nbut the way to this victory appears to be long and difficult.\nApparently, the reason of the AD stability lies in obviousness and habitualness\nof those statements, which appear to be associative delusions afterwards. On the\nground of these statements one constructs scientific conceptions, which agree with\nexperimental data and observations. Declaring these habitual statements to be a\ndelusions, one destroys existing scientific conceptions and tries to construct new\nconceptions. It is always very difficult for the scientific community.\nIn the science history a series of associative delusions is known. Let us list them\nin the chronological order.\nAD.1. The antipodes paradox, generated by that the gravitational field direction\nis connected with a preferred direction in the space, but not with the direction\ntowards the Earth centre.\nAD.2. The Ptolemaic doctrine in the celestial mechanics, where the property of\nbeing the \"universe\" centre was attributed to the Earth, whereas the Sun is such a\ncentre.\nAD.3. Prejudices against the Riemannian geometry in the second half of the XIX\ncentury are connected with that the Cartesian coordinate system was considered to\nbe an attribute of any geometry, whereas it was only a method of the Euclidean\ngeometry description.\nAD.4. Impossibility of employment of the pure metrical conception of geometry,\nconnected with the associative delusion, that the concept of the curve is considered\nto be a fundamental concept of any geometry, whereas the curve is only a geometrical\nobject, used in the Euclidean and Riemannian geometry.\nAD.5. Impossibility of construction of dynamical conception of statistical description (DCSD), connected with the associative delusion, that any statistical de3\n\n\fscription is considered to be produced in terms of the probability theory, and the\nprobability concept is a fundamental concept of any statistical description.\nAD.6. Identification of individual particle S with the statistically averaged particle hSi, used at the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics. Such an\nidentification is a kind of associative delusion, when the individual particle properties S are attributed to the statistically averaged particle hSi and vice versa. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger cat paradox and some other quantum mechanics paradoxes, connected\nwith the wave function reduction, are corollaries of this identification.\nAD.7. The forced identification of energy and Hamiltonian, used in relativistic\nquantum field theory (QFT), is also an associative delusion. As any associative\ndelusion this identification is connected with attributing properties of one object to\nanother one. In the given case the coincidence of energy and Hamiltonian for a free\nnonrelativistic particle is considered to be a fundamental property of any particle\nwithout sufficient foundations. We shall denote this delusion symbolically by means\nof E = H, where E is the energy, and H is the Hamiltonian.\nThe first three of the seven listed delusions (AD.1 \u2013 AD.3) had been overcame\nto the beginning of XX century, though a detailed analysis of these overcoming is,\nmaybe, absent in the literature. As to AD.4 \u2013 AD.7, the scientific community is yet\ndestined to overcome them. Besides these ADs exist simultaneously, and the order\nof their listing corresponds basically to their importance rather than to chronology.\nThe purely metric conception of geometry (CG), where all information on geometry is given by means a distance between to space points, is the most general\nconception of geometry (CG). It generates the most complete list of geometries, suitable for the space-time description. AD.4 discriminates the purely metric CG. As a\nresult instead of it one uses Riemannian CG, generating incomplete list of possible\ngeometries. The true space-time geometry is absent in this list, and we are doomed\nto use the Minkowski geometry for the space-time description. The Minkowski geometry is incorrect geometry for small space-time scales, i.e. in the micro world.\nIn the true space-time geometry the micro particle motion is primordially stochastic, and the properties of the geometry are an origin of this stochasticity. In the\nMinkowski geometry the motion of any particle is deterministic, and incorrectness\nof the Minkowski geometry lies in this fact.\nAD.5 leads to impossibility of a construction of a consecutive statistical description of the stochastically moving micro particles (electrons, positrons, etc.) ,\nalthough it is doubtless that quantum mechanics, describing the regular component\nof this motion, is a statistical theory. AD.4 and AD.5 establish such a situation,\nwhen one is forced to use a series of additional hypotheses (quantum mechanics principles) for a correct description of observed quantum phenomena. It is much as the\nPtolemeus used a series of additional construction (epicycles, differents) for explanation of observed motion of heavenly bodies. They were needed for compensation\nof AD.2.\nOvercoming of AD.4 and AD.5 admits one to eliminate the quantum mechanics\nprinciples and to construct the quantum phenomena theory as a consecutive statistical description of stochastic micro particle motion. At such a description the\n4\n\n\fmicro particle stochasticity has a geometric origin, i.e. it is generated by the spacetime geometry. The consecutive statistical description of the micro particles appears\nas a result of a construction of the dynamical conception of statistical description\n(DCSD), that becomes to be possible after overcoming of AD.5. The elimination of\nthe quantum mechanics principles after overcoming of AD.4 and AD.5 resembles the\neliminating of Ptolemaic epicycles, when they stopped to be necessary after overcoming AD.2 and the subsequent transition from the Ptolemaic doctrine to that of\nCopernicus.\nAD.6 has not such a global character as AD.4 and AD.5. It concerns mainly the\ninterpretation of the measurement concept in quantum mechanics.\nAD.7 has not the global character also. It acts only in the scope of the relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). QFT in itself is only a section of the Ptolemaic\nconception, i.e. a conception, which uses additional hypotheses (quantum mechanics\nprinciples), compensating incorrect choice of the space-time model. AD.7 (identification of energy and Hamiltonian E = H) generates a series of difficulties in QFT\n(non-stationary vacuum, necessity of the perturbation theory and some other). In\nfact, there is no necessity the energy \u2013 Hamiltonian identification E = H. The secondary quantization can be carried out without imposing this constraint [1, 2]. The\ncondition E = H appears to be inconsistent with dynamic equations. Imposition of\nthis constraint makes QFT to be inconsistent. On one hand, such an inconsistency\nleads to above mentioned difficulties, but on the other hand, such an inconsistency\nadmits one to explain the pair production effect, because any inconsistent theory\nadmits one to explain all what you want. One needs only to show sufficient ingenuity. On one hand, elimination of the constraint E = H leads to a theory which is\nconsequent in the scope of quantum theory and free from the above mentioned difficulties, but on the other hand, it leads to that the theory stops to describe the pair\nproduction effect. This deplorable fact means only, that the undertaken attempt\nof the FTP construction on the basis of unification of the relativity principles with\nthose of quantum mechanics failed, and one should search for alternative conception.\nLet us take into account that the quantum mechanics is a compensating (Ptolemaic) conception, i.e. just as the quantum mechanics principles have been invented\nfor compensation of AD.4 and AD.5, as the Ptolemaic epicycles have been invented\nfor compensation of AD.2. Then an attempt of unification of quantum mechanics\nprinciples with the relativity ones is as useless, as an attempt of introduction of\nPtolemaic epicycles in Newtonian mechanics.\nApparently, the conception, appeared after overcoming of AD.4 and AD.5, is\na reasonable alternative to QFT. Such a conception is consistently relativistic and\nquantum (in the sense that it contains the quantum constant ~, contained explicitly\nin the space-time metric). It does not contain the quantum mechanics principles,\nand one does not need to unite them with the relativity principles. We shall refer to\nthis conception as the model conception of quantum phenomena, distinguishing it\nfrom conventional quantum mechanics, which will be referred to as axiomatic conception of quantum phenomena. The difference between axiomatic conception and\nmodel one is much as the difference between the thermodynamics and the statisti5\n\n\fcal physics. The thermodynamics may be qualified as the axiomatic conception of\nthermal phenomena, whereas the statistical physics may be qualified as the model\nconception of thermal phenomena. The transition from the axiomatic conception\nto the model one was carried out after a construction of the \"calorific fluid\" model\n(chaotic motion of molecules), and the thermodynamics axioms, describing properties of the fundamental thermodynamical object \u2013 \"calorific fluid\", stopped to be\nnecessary. Concept of \"calorific fluid\" is not used usually in the statistical physics,\nbut if it is introduced, its properties are determined from its model (chaotic molecular motion).\nSimilar situation takes place in the interrelations between the axiomatic and\nmodel conceptions of quantum phenomena. In the axiomatic conception there is a\nfundamental object, called the wave function. Its properties are determined by the\nquantum mechanics principles. The wave function is that object, which differs the\nquantum mechanics from the classical one, where the wave function is absent. In the\nmodel conception one constructs a \"model of the wave function\" [3]. Thereafter the\nwave function properties are obtained from this model, and one does not need the\nquantum mechanics principles. Axiomatic and model conceptions lead to the same\nresult in the nonrelativistic case, but in the relativistic case the results are different,\nin general. For instance, application of the model conception to investigation of the\ndynamic system SD , described by the Dirac equation, leads to another result [4],\nthan investigation, produced by conventional methods in the scope of the axiomatic\nconception. In the first case the classical analog of the Dirac particle SD is a relativistic rotator, consisting of two charged particles, rotating around their common\ncenter of mass. In the second case the classical analog is a pointlike particle, having\nspin and magnetic moment.\nAn existence of the associative delusion does not permit one to construct a rigorous scientific conception. The constructed building appears to be a compensating\n(Ptolemaic) conception, where an incorrect statement is compensated by means of\nadditional suppositions. In general, the Ptolemaic conception is not true. But there\nare such fields of its application, where its employment leads to correct results,\nwhich agree with observations and experimental data. For instance, in the scope of\nthe Ptolemaic doctrine one can choose such epicycles and differents for any planet,\nthat one can calculate its motion in a sufficient long time so, that predictions agree\nwith observations. But there is a class of the celestial mechanics problems, which\ncould not be solved in the scope of the Ptolemaic doctrine. For instance, in the\nscope of this doctrine one cannot solve such a problem: when and with what velocity should one throw a stone from the Earth's surface, in order that it could\ndrop on the Moon. In the scope of the Ptolemaic doctrine one cannot discover the\ngravitation law and construct the Newtonian mechanics. The associative delusion,\nembedded in the ground of the Ptolemaic doctrine and disguised by means of compensating hypotheses, hindered the progress of celestial mechanics. As far as in that\ntime the celestial mechanics was the only exact natural science, AD hindered the\nnormal development of natural sciences at all. The development of natural sciences\nwent to blind alley. After overcoming of AD.2 the natural sciences development was\n6\n\n\faccelerated strongly.\nThe same situation takes place with the quantum mechanics. Although at the\nfirst acquaintance the quantum mechanics seems to be a disordered collection of\nrules for calculation of mathematical expectations, nevertheless, in the nonrelativistic case an employment of these rules leads to results which agree with experiments.\nAccepting the quantum mechanical principles, the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as a whole is a consistent conception, which describes excellently a wide class\nof physical phenomena. But at the transition to the field of relativistic phenomena\n(pair production, elementary particles theory) the quantum principles stop to be\nsufficient. One is forced to introduce new suppositions. The further the quantum\ntheory advances in the field of relativistic phenomena, the more new suppositions\nare to be introduced for descriptions of observed phenomena. This is an indirect\nindication, that the conventional way of the quantum theory development comes to\na blind alley.\nInvestigation of possible methods of the associative delusions overcoming is a\nsubject of this paper. On one hand, overcoming of any special associative delusion\nneeds a knowledge of the subject of investigation and a professional approach to the\ninvestigation of the phenomenon. On the other hand, the Ptolemaic conceptions\nhave some common properties, and a work with them has some specific character,\nwhich should be known, if we want to overcome corresponding ADs effectively.\nFirst, it is very difficult to discover the associative delusion. Indirect indications\nof AD are an increasing complexity of the theory and a necessity of new additional\nsuppositions. These indications show that the associative delusion does exist, but\nthey do not permit one to determine, what is this AD.\nSecond, the work with Ptolemaic conceptions, i.e. with conceptions, containing AD, generates a special pragmatic style (P-style) of investigations. the P-style\nlies in the fact that one searches all possible ways of explanation and calculation\nof the considered phenomenon. Of course, different versions, considered at such an\napproach, are restricted by the existing mathematical technique and by the possibilities of the researcher's imagination. But these restrictions are essentially slighter,\nthan the restrictions imposed by the classical style (C-style) of investigations. The\nclassical style (C-style) is the style of investigations, fully developed in the natural\nsciences to the end of the XIX century.\nUnprejudiced reader will agree that the delusions AD.1 \u2013 AD.3, having been\novercame, are delusions indeed, and that it was worth to overcame them. But it\nis rather doubtless that he agrees at once that AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 are also delusions\nand that they are to be overcame. If it were so, then AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 have been\novercame many years ago. Of course, ADs are undesirable as any other delusions.\nOne should eliminate them, if it is possible. But one should not consider them as\nmisunderstandings, or manifestations of researcher's stupidity. ADs are inevitable\nattributes of the cognitive processes, as far as they are conditioned by the restriction\nof the field of investigated phenomena at the initial stage of investigations. ADs were\nin the past, they exist now, and apparently, they will exist in the future. We should\nknow, how to live with them and to make investigation. The situation resembles\n7\n\n\fthe situation with a noise. We transmit information at presence of a noise, and\nwe know that the noise is undesirable, that the noise should be removed, and that,\nunfortunately, it cannot be removed completely.\nOne should study associative delusions, their properties and the influence on the\nstyle of thinking and investigations of researchers, which are forced to work under\nconditions of the associative delusions presence. Investigation of ADs properties\nand possibilities of their overcoming is a goal of this paper. We begin with detailed\ninvestigations of AD.4 \u2013 AD.7, to make sure that they are delusions indeed and\nto understand how to overcome them. It is very important, because experience of\novercoming of AD.2 (Ptolemaic doctrine) shows that the overcoming process is very\ndifficult for scientific community.\nUsually these difficulties are connected with a negative role of the Catholic\nchurch. B.V. Raushenbach [5] considers that the position of the Catholic church\nis not the case. It was incompetent in problems of celestial mechanics. It agreed\nsimply with opinion of the most of that time researchers. Most of scientists of that\ntime were priests, and B.V. Raushenbach considers that they used the Catholic\nchurch simply as a tool for a fight against proponents of the Copernicus doctrine.\nExperience of the author in attempts of overcoming of AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 shows, that\nthis is B.V. Raushenbach, who is right.\nIn sections 2 \u2013 5 one considers properties of AD.4 \u2013 AD.7. In the sixth section\ninfluence of associative delusions on the style of investigations is considered. In\nsections from seventh to twelfth the details of history of the AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 overcoming\nare presented in the form, as the author of this paper saw it.\n\n2\n\nConception of geometry and a correct choice of\nthe space-time geometry\n\nThe conception of geometry (CG) is considered to be the method (a set of rules),\nby means of which the geometry is constructed. The proper Euclidean1 geometry\ncan be constructed on the basis of different geometric conceptions.\nFor instance, one can use the Euclidean axiomatic conception (Euclidean axioms), or the Riemannian conception of geometry (dimension, manifold, metric tensor, curve). One can use the topology-metric conception of geometry (topological\nspace, metric, curve). In any case one obtains the same proper Euclidean geometry. From point of view of this geometry it is of no importance which of possible\ngeometric conceptions is used for the geometry construction.\nBut if we are going to choose a geometry for the real space-time, it is very important, that the list of all possible geometries, suitable for the space-time description,\nwould be complete. If the true space-time geometry is absent in this list, we are\ndoomed to a choice of a false geometry independently of the method which is used\n1\n\nWe use the term \"Euclidean geometry\" as a collective concept with respect to terms \"proper\nEuclidean geometry\" and \"pseudoeuclidean geometry\". In the first case the eigenvalues of the\nmetric tensor matrix have similar signs, in the second case they have different signs.\n\n8\n\n\ffor a choice of the space-time geometry. Thus, a determination of the complete list\nof all possible geometries is a necessary condition of a correct choice of the spacetime geometry. In turn the determination of the possible geometries list depends\non the conception of geometry (CG), which is used for determination of the list of\npossible geometries. Any of possible CG contains information of two sorts: (1) nonnumerical information in the form of concepts, axioms and propositions, formulated\nverbally, (2) numerical information in the form of numbers and numerical functions\nof space points. In different CG this information is presented differently.\n\ntitle of CG\nEuclidean CG\nRiemannian CG\n\nnon-numerical\ninformation\nEuclidean axioms\nManifold, curve\ncoordinate system\n\ntopologymetric CG\n\ntopological space,\ncurve\n\npurely\nmetric CG\n\n\u2205\n\nnumerical information\n\u2205\nn, gik (x)\n\u03c1 (P, Q) \u2265 0,\n\u03c1 (P, Q) = 0, iff P = Q\n\u03c1 (P, Q) + \u03c1 (Q, R) \u2265 \u03c1 (P, R)\n\u03c3 (P, Q) = 21 \u03c12 (P, Q) \u2208 R\n\nVarying the numerical information at fixed the non-numerical one, we obtain\ndifferent geometries in the scope of the same conception of geometry. Varying continuously numbers and functions, constituting numerical information of CG, one\nobtains a continuous set of geometries, each of them differs slightly from the narrow\none. Any admissible value of numerical information is attributed some geometry\nin the scope of the given CG. One can also change non-numerical information, replacing one axiom by another. But at such a replacement the geometry changes\nstep-wise, and one should monitor that replacements of one axiom by another does\nnot lead to inconsistencies. It is complicated and inconvenient. It is easier to obtain new geometries in the scope of the same conception, changing only numerical\ninformation.\nOne can see from this table, that different CG have different capacity of the\nnumerical information and generate the geometry classes of different power. The\nEuclidean CG does not contain the numerical information at all. Vice versa, the\npurely metric CG contains only numerical information and generates the most powerful class of geometries which will be referred to as tubular geometries (or briefly\nT-geometries).\nThe T-geometry has many attractive features. Firstly, it is very simple and\nrealizes the simple attractive idea, that for determination of a geometry on a set \u03a9\nof points P it is sufficient to give the distance \u03c1(P, Q) between all pairs {P, Q} of\npoints of the set \u03a9. In fact, the distance \u03c1(P, Q) is determined by means of the world\nfunction \u03c3 = 12 \u03c12 on the set \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9. In spite of simplicity and attractiveness of this\n9\n\n\fidea the existence possibility in itself of the purely metric CG was being problematic\nfor a long time. K. Menger [6] and J.L. Blumenthal [7] tried to construct so called\ndistance geometry, which was founded on the concept of distance in a larger degree,\nthan it is made in the topology-metric CG. But they failed to construct the purely\nmetric CG. The reason of the failure was AD.4. The statement of necessary and\nsufficient conditions of the geometry Euclideness in terms of the world function \u03c3,\ngiven on the set \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9, was a crucial step in construction of the purely metric CG.\nThe prove [8, 9, 10] of the fact, that the Euclidean geometry can be constructed in\nterms of only \u03c3 meant a possibility of construction of any T-geometry in terms of\n\u03c3. It meant existence of the purely metric CG.\nIn the scope of purely metric CG all information on geometry is derived from the\nworld function. In particular, if one can introduce a dimension of the space {\u03a9, \u03c3},\nthis information can be derived from the world function. From the world function\none can derive information on continuity, or discontinuity of the space {\u03a9, \u03c3}. In\nthe case of continuous geometry the information on the coordinate systems and\nmetric tensor can be also derived from the world function. In T-geometry there is\nan absolute parallelism (which is absent in Riemannian geometries). Besides the\nT-geometry has a new property \u2013 nondegeneracy.\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nThe geometry is called a nondegenerate, if there are many vectors P0 Q of fixed\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nlength |P0 Q|, parallel to the vector P0 P1 . In the degenerate geometry there is only\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\none such a vector P0 Q.\nNondegeneracy of T-geometry may be conceived as follows. Any T-geometry\ncan be obtained from the Euclidean geometry by means of its deformation (i.e.\na change of distance \u03c1(P, Q) between the space points). At such a deformation\nthe geometrical objects of Euclidean geometry change their shape. If the obtained\nT-geometry is degenerate, the Euclidean straights transform to lines, which are\ncurved lines, in general. But it is possible such a deformation, that the straight\nof n-dimensional Euclidean space converts into (n \u2212 1)-dimensional tube. For it\nwould be a possible, the straight is to be defined as a set of points, possessing some\nproperty of the Euclidean straight. Definition of the straight as a curve, possessing\nsome property of the Euclidean straight prohibits automatically deformation of the\nEuclidean straight into (n \u2212 1)-dimensional tube and discriminates nondegenerate\ngeometries.\nIf one considers nondegenerate T-geometry of the space-time, the motion of free\nparticles in such a space-time appears to be stochastic, although the geometry in\nitself (i.e. the world function \u03c3) is deterministic. In other words, nondegeneracy of\nthe space-time geometry generates an indeterminism.\nIn the Riemannian CG the deformation, converting a line into a tube, is forbidden. It is connected with AD.4, according to which the curve is a fundamental\nobject of geometry, and there are not to be such geometries, where the curve would\nbe replaced by a surface. It is in this point, where AD.4 discriminates purely metric CG and T-geometries, generated by this CG. As a corollary the list of possible\ngeometries reduces strongly. The true space-time geometry fall out of the list of\npossible geometries, and one chooses a false model for the space-time.\n10\n\n\fIn the present time one uses the Riemannian conception for obtaining the spacetime geometry. In the simplest case, when one can neglect gravitation, the spacetime is uniform, isotropic and flat. In the scope of the Riemannian geometry there\nis only one flat uniform isotropic geometry. It is the Minkowski geometry, for which\nthe world function has the form:\n\u0011\n1\u0010 2\n\u2032 2\n\u2032 2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(2.1)\nc (t \u2212 t ) \u2212 (x \u2212 x )\n\u03c3M (x, x ) = \u03c3M (t, x, t , x ) =\n2\nwhere c is the speed of the light, and x = {t, x}, x\u2032 = {t\u2032 , x\u2032 } are coordinates of two\narbitrary points in the space-time.\nThus, in the case of Riemannian CG the problem of choosing space-time geometry does not appear. It is determined uniquely.\nThe topology-metric CG cannot be applied to the space-time, because it supposes that \u03c3 (P, Q) = 21 \u03c12 (P, Q) \u2265 0, whereas in the space-time there are spacelike\nintervals, for which \u03c3 (P, Q) < 0.\nThe purely metric CG generates a whole class of flat uniform isotropic T-geometries,\nlabelled by a function of one argument. In this case the world function has the form\n\u03c3 (x, x\u2032 ) = \u03c3M (x, x\u2032 ) + D (\u03c3M (x, x\u2032 )) ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03c3M is the world function for the Minkowski space (2.1), and the function D\nis an arbitrary function, labelling possible flat uniform isotropic geometries. These\ngeometries differ one from another in the shape of tubes, obtained as a result of the\nEuclidean straight deformation. Hence, they differ in the stochasticity character of\nthe free particles motion. For the purely metric CG the problem of choice of the\nspace-time geometry is very important, because there are many uniform isotropic\ngeometries. To set D \u2261 0 in (2.2) and choose the Minkowski geometry would be incorrect, because in the Minkowski geometry the motion of particles is deterministic.\nBut it is well known that the motion of real micro particles (electrons, positrons, etc.)\nis stochastic. In other words, experiments with single particles are irreproducible.\nOnly distributions of results, i.e. results of mass experiments with many similarly\nprepared particles are reproducible. These distributions of results are described by\nquantum mechanics, constructed on the basis of some additional hypotheses, known\nas principles of quantum mechanics.\nWhen there are such space-time geometries, where the motion of particles is primordially stochastic, one cannot consider as reasonable such an approach, where at\nfirst one chooses the Minkowski geometry with deterministic motion of particles, and\nthereafter one introduces additional suppositions (quantum mechanics principles),\nproviding a description of the stochastic motion of micro particles. It would be more\ncorrect to choose the space-time geometry in such a way, that a statistical description of stochastic motion of micro particles would describe correctly experimental\ndata. As far as the quantum mechanics describes all nonrelativistic experiments\nvery well, it is sufficient to choose the space-time so, that the statistical description\nof stochastic motion of micro particles would agree with predictions of quantum\nmechanics.\n11\n\n\fAt first sight, it seems that the quantum effects cannot be explained by peculiarities of geometry, because intensity of quantum effects depends on the particle\nmass essentially, and the mass is such a characteristic of a particle, which is not\nconnected with a geometry. It seems that influence of a geometry on the particle\nmotion is to be similar for particles of any mass. In reality the influence of geometry\ndoes not depend on particle motion only in the nondegenerate geometry (Minkowski\ngeometry). In the space-time with the nondegenerate geometry the particle mass,\nas well as its momentum are geometrical characteristics.\nThe world tube of the particle with the mass m is described by the broken\nworld tube Tbr , which is determined by a sequence of the break points {Pi },\ni = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .. The adjacent points Pi , Pi+1 are connected between themselves\nby a segment T[Pi Pi+1 ] of the straight. This segment is determined by the relation\nT[Pi Pi+1 ] = {R|S (Pi , R) + S (R, Pi+1 ) = S (Pi , Pi+1 )}\n(2.3)\np\nwhere S (Pi , Pi+1 ) = 2\u03c3 (Pi , Pi+1 ) is the distance between the points Pi and Pi+1 .\nThe set of points {Pi }, i = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . will be referred to as the skeleton of the\ntube Tbr .\nIn the proper Euclidean geometry as well as in the Minkowski geometry (for\ntimelike interval S 2 (Pi , Pi+1 ) > 0) the set of points (2.3) forms a segment of the\nstraight line, connecting points Pi , Pi+1 . In the nondegenerate geometry the set\nT[Pi Pi+1 ] forms a three-dimensional cigar-shaped surface with the ends at the points\nPi , Pi+1 .\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nThe vector Pi Pi+1 = {Pi , Pi+1 } is interpreted as the particle 4-momentum on the\nsegment T[Pi Pi+1 ] of the particle world tube Tbr\nTbr =\n\n[\ni\n\nT[Pi Pi+1 ] .\n\n(2.4)\n\np\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n2\u03c3 (Pi , Pi+1 ) of the vector Pi Pi+1 is the\nThe length Pi Pi+1 = S (Pi , Pi+1) =\ngeometrical mass \u03bc of the particle, expressed in units of length. The universal\nconstant b connects the geometrical mass \u03bc with the usual mass m of the particle.\nm = b\u03bc = bS (Pi , Pi+1 ) ,\n\ni = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...\n\n[b] = g/cm\n\n(2.5)\n\nAll segments T[Pi Pi+1 ] , i = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ... has the same length \u03bc = m/b. Thus,\nin general, m is a geometrical characteristic of the particle, but in the case of the\nMinkowski geometry one cannot determine the particle mass, using the world line\nshape, because one cannot determine points Pi of the world line Tbr skeleton on the\nbasis of the world line shape. In the case of nondegenerate space-time geometry\nthe points Pi of the skeleton are end points of the cigar-shaped segments T[Pi Pi+1 ] .\nThey can be determined via intakes of the broken tube (2.4). Interval S (Pi , Pi+1 )\nbetween adjacent points Pi of the skeleton determines the geometrical mass \u03bc of the\nparticle.\n12\n\n\f\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nFor a free particle the 4-momenta Pi Pi+1 and Pi+1 Pi+2 of two adjacent segments\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nT[Pi Pi+1 ] and T[Pi+1 Pi+2 ] are parallel Pi Pi+1 \u2191\u2191 Pi+1 Pi+2 . In the Minkowski geometry\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nthere is only one vector Pi+1 Pi+2 of the length \u03bc, parallel to timelike vector Pi Pi+1 .\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nHence, if the vector P0 P1 is fixed, all other vectors Pi Pi+1 i = 1, 2, ... are determined\nuniquely. In other words, in the Minkowski geometry the total world line Tbr is\ndetermined uniquely, provided one of its segments is fixed. It means that the motion\nof a free particle in the space-time with Minkowski geometry is deterministic.\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nIn the space-time with nondegenerate geometry there are many vectors Pi+1 Pi+2\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nof the length \u03bc, parallel to the timelike vector Pi Pi+1 . It means that the end Pi+2\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nof the vector Pi+1 Pi+2 is not determined uniquely, even if the vector Pi Pi+1 is fixed.\nOther points Pi+3 , Pi+4 ,... are not determined uniquely also. It means that the\nbroken tube Tbr is stochastic. Thus, the motion of a free particle in the spacetime with nondegenerate geometry is stochastic. The character and intensity of the\nstochasticity depend on the form of the function D (\u03c3M ) in the relation (2.2).\nSupposing that the statistical description of stochastic world tubes gives the same\nresult, as the quantum-mechanical description in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\none can calculate the distortion function D (\u03c3M ). The calculation gives [11]\n\u001a\nd if \u03c3M > \u03c30\nD = D (\u03c3M ) =\n(2.6)\n0 if \u03c3M \u2264 0\n~\nd =\n= const \u2248 10\u221221 cm,\n\u03c30 = const \u2248 d\n2bc\nHere ~ is the quantum constant, and b \u2248 10\u221217 g/cm is a new universal constant.\nInside the interval (0, \u03c30 ) values of the function D (\u03c3M ) are not yet determined.\nFrom the three-dimensional viewpoint the micro particle is a pulsating sphere.\nPeriod T of pulsations depends on the particle mass m. It is determined by the\nrelation \u221a\nT = m/(bc), where b is the universal constant. The maximal sphere radius\nRmax \u2248 d does not depend on the particle mass. Approximately one can assume\nthat in the period T the sphere radius increases from zero up to maximal value\nRmax , and then it reduces to zero. In the period T the sphere centre moves along\nthe straight line uniformly. At the collapse moment a random jump-like change\nof velocity takes place. In the coordinate system, where the sphere is at rest the\nvelocity jump is equal approximately to Rmax /T \u2248 m\u22121 (~bc/2)1/2 . The lesser is the\nparticle mass the larger is the velocity jump. Besides, the period T depends on the\nparticle mass. As a result for the particle of small mass the random velocity jumps\nare happens more often and have the larger magnitude. Thus, choosing the spacetime geometry in the form (2.2), (2.6), one can explain all nonrelativistic quantum\neffects without referring to quantum principles. Such a space-time geometry is\nmore correct, than the Minkowski geometry, because in this case one does not need\nadditional hypotheses in the form of quantum principles. In such a geometry the\nquantum constant appears in the theory together with the distortion function (2.6).\nIt is an attribute of the space-time, that agrees with the universal character of the\nquantum constant ~.\n13\n\n\f3\n\nDynamical conception of statistical description\n\nAs we have mentioned, the choice of the space-time geometry is determined by the\ncondition that the statistical description of the stochastic motion of particles is to\ncoincide with the norelativistic quantum-mechanical description. It means that the\nquantum mechanics is to be represented as a statistical description of randomly\nmoving particles. In the end of XIX century the thermodynamics was presented as\na statistical description of chaotically moving molecules. After this representation\nmany researchers thought that something like that can be made with the quantum\nmechanics. It is a common practice to think that any statistical description is\nproduced in terms of the probability theory. In this point we meet AD.5, where it\nis supposed that there is no statistical description without the probability theory.\nAttempts [12, 13] of formulating the quantum mechanics in terms of the probability\ntheory failed. The fact is that, attempting to represent the quantum mechanics as a\nstatistical description of stochastic particle motion, one overlooks usually, that the\nrandom component of the particle motion can be relativistic, whereas the regular\ncomponent remains to be nonrelativistic.\nThe probability theory, applied successfully to the statistical physics for statistical description of the chaotic molecule motion, is not suitable for a description\nof the stochastic motion of relativistic particles. The fact is that, the employment\nof the probability density supposes splitting of all possible system states into sets\nof simultaneous independent events. In the relativistic theory it cannot be made\nfor a continuous dynamic system, as far as there is no absolute simultaneity in the\nspecial relativity. The simultaneity at some coordinate system cannot be used also,\nbecause the coordinate system is a method of description. Application of the probability theory and of the conditional simultaneity (simultaneity at some coordinate\nsystem) means an application of the statistics to the description methods instead of\nthe necessary calculation of the dynamic system states.\nOne can overcome the appeared obstacle, rejecting employment of the probability\ntheory at the statistical description. Indeed, the term \"statistical description\" means\nonly that one considers many identical, or almost identical objects. Application\nof the probability theory in the statistical description is not necessary, because it\nimposes some constraints on the method of the description, that is undesirable. For\ninstance, the probability density must be nonnegative, and sometimes this constraint\ncannot be satisfied.\nIn the nonrelativistic physics the physical object to be statistically described\nis a particle, i.e. a point in the usual space or in the phase one. The density of\npoints (particles) in the space is nonnegative, it is a ground for introduction of\nthe probability density concept. In the relativistic theory the physical object to be\nstatistically described is a world-line in the space-time. The density of world lines in\nthe vicinity of some point x is a 4-vector, which cannot be a ground for introduction\nof the probability density. The alternative version, when any world line is considered\nto be a point in some space V, admits one to introduce the concept of the probability\ndensity in the space V of world lines. But such a description is non-local, as far as two\n14\n\n\fworld lines, coinciding everywhere except for some remote regions, are represented\nby different points in V, and this points are not close, in general. In other words,\nsuch an introduction of the probability is very inconvenient.\nTo get out of this situation, one needs to reject from employment of the probability theory at the statistical description. Instead of the probabilistic conception\nthe dynamical conception of statistical description (DCSD) should be used. Instead\nof the stochastic system Sst , for which there are no dynamic equations, one should\nuse a set E[N, Sst ], consisting of large number N of identical independent systems\nSst and known as the statistical ensemble of systems Sst . The statistical ensemble\nE[N, Sst ] forms a deterministic dynamical system, for which there are dynamic equations, although they do not exist for elements Sst of the statistical ensemble. The\nstatistical description lies in the fact that one investigates properties of E[N, Sst ] as\na deterministic dynamic system, and on the basis of this investigation one makes\nsome conclusions on properties of its elements (stochastic systems Sst )). As far as\none investigates a dynamic system (statistical ensemble) and its properties, there is\nno necessity to use the concept of probability.\nAlong with the statistical ensemble E[N, S] of systems S, or even instead of it,\none can introduce the statistically averaged dynamic system hSi, which is defined\nformally as a statistical ensemble E [N, S], (N \u2192 \u221e), normalized to one system.\nMathematically it means that, if AE [N, dN {X}] is the action for E [N, S], then\n1\nAE [N, dN {X}] ,\nN \u2192\u221e N\n\nhSi : AhSi [d {X}] = lim\n\nd {X} = lim dN {X}\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nis the action for hSi, where X is a state of a single system S, and dN {X} is the\ndistribution, describing in the limit N \u2192 \u221e both the state of the statistical ensemble\nE [N, S] and the state of the statistically averaged system hSi.\nReplacement of the statistical ensemble E [N, S] by the statistically averaged\nsystem hSi is founded on the insensibility of the statistical ensemble to the number\nN of its elements, under condition that N is large enough. The statistically averaged\nsystem hSi is a kind of a statistical ensemble. Formally it is displayed in the fact\nthat the state of hSi, as well as the state of the statistical ensemble E [N, S] is\ndescribed by the distribution dN {X}, N \u2192 \u221e, whereas the state of a single system\nS is described by the quantities X, but not by their distribution. Using this formal\ncriterion, one can distinguish between the individual dynamic system S and the\nstatistically averaged system hSi.\nTo obtain the quantum mechanics as a statistical description of stochastic motion\nof micro particles, one needs to make one important step more. It is necessary to\nintroduce the wave function \u03c8, which is the main object of quantum mechanics.\nUsually the wave function is introduced axiomatically, i.e. as an object, satisfying a\nsystem of axioms (principles of quantum mechanics). For this reason the meaning\nof the wave function is obscure. To clarify it, one has to introduce the wave function\nas an attribute of some model.\nIf S is a particle (deterministic or random), then the statistical ensemble E [N, S]\nof particles S, or statistically averaged particle hSi are continuous dynamic systems\n15\n\n\fof the fluid type. It is well known [14], that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be represented as an equation, describing irrotational flow of some ideal fluid. In other\nwords, the wave function can be considered to be an attribute of irrotational fluid\nflow. One can show [3], that the reciprocal statement (any fluid flow can be described in terms of a wave function) is also valid. The rotational flow is described\nby a many-component wave function. In other words, at the rotational flow the spin\nappears.\nAs far as the statistically averaged particle hSi is a fluid, the wave function\nappears to be a description method of this fluid hSi. For the statistical description\nof the particle S coincides with the quantum mechanical description, it is necessary\nto find the state equation of the fluid hSi, which is determined in turn by the form\nof the distortion function D. Corresponding calculation was made in the paper [11].\nThis calculation determines the form (2.6) of the distortion function. Then one\nobtains the conception, which will be referred to as the model conception of quantum\nphenomena (MCQP). For the conventional presentation of quantum mechanics the\nterm \"the axiomatic conception of quantum phenomena\" (ACQP) will be used.\nDynamical conception of statistical description (DCSD) generates a less informative description, than the probabilistic statistical description in the sense that\nsome conclusions and estimations, which can be made at the probabilistic description, cannot be made in the scope of DCSD. One is forced to accept this, because\none cannot obtain a more informative description. The fact that the quantum mechanics is perceived as a dynamical (but not as a statistical, i.e. probabilistic) conception is connected with the employment of DCSD. In turn application of DCSD\nis conditioned by \"relativistic roots\" of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The\n\"dynamic perception\" of quantum mechanics takes place in the scope of both conceptions MCQP and ACQP. Let us note that DCSD is an universal conception in\nthe sense that it can by used in both relativistic and nonrelativistic cases.\n\n4\n\nIdentification of individual particle with the\nstatistically averaged one\n\n\"Dynamical perception\" of quantum mechanics leads to the fact that the statistically averaged particle hSi, described by the wave function, is considered to be\nsimply a real particle S. The question, why the real particle S is described by the\nwave function \u03c8, i.e. by the continuous set of variables (but not by position and\nmomentum as an usual particle), is answered usually, that it is conditioned by the\nquantum character of the particle. One refers usually to the quantum mechanics\nprinciples, according to which the quantum particle state is described by the wave\nfunction \u03c8, whereas the classical one is described by a position and a momentum. At\nthis point we meet AD.6, when one does not differ between the statistically averaged\nparticle hSi and the individual particle S.\nAs a corollary of such an identification the properties of hSi and S are confused,\nand an object with inconsistent properties appears. As long as we work with math16\n\n\fematical technique of quantum mechanics, dealing only with hSi, no contradictions\nand no paradoxes appear. But as soon as the measurement process is described,\nwhere both objects hSi and S appear, the ground for inconsistencies and paradoxes\ncome into existence. Combinations of contradictory properties may be very exotic.\nThere are at least two different measurement processes. The measurement (Smeasurement), produced under an individual system S, leads always to a definite\nresult and does not influence the wave function, which is an attribute of the statistically averaged system hSi. The measurement (M-measurement), produced under\nthe statistically averaged system hSi, is a set of many S-measurements, produced\nunder individual systems S, constituting the statistically averaged system hSi. The\nN-measurement changes the wave function of the system hSi and does not lead to\na definite result. It leads to a distribution of results.\nThe following situation takes place the most frequently. One considers that\nthe wave function describes the state of an individual system, and a measurement,\nproduced under individual system, changes the state (wave function) at this system.\nAs a result a paradox, connected with the wave function reduction and known as the\nSchr\u00f6dinger cat, appears. A corollary of such an approach is so called many-world\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics [15, 16].\n\n5\n\nIdentification of Hamiltonian and energy at the\nsecondary quantization of relativistic field\n\nThe energy of a closed dynamic system is defined as the integral from the time\ncomponent T 00 of the energy-momentum tensor\nZ\nE = T 00 dx\n(5.1)\nThe energy is a very important conservative quantity. The Hamilton function\n(Hamiltonian) of the system is a quantity canonically conjugate to the time, i.e.\nthe quantity, determining the time evolution of the system. By their definitions\nthe Hamiltonian H and the energy E are quite different quantities. But in the\nnonrelativistic physics (classical and quantum) these quantities coincide in many\ncases. For instance, the energy of a particle in a given potential field U (x) has the\nform E = p2 /2m + U (x). The Hamiltonian of the particle has the same form. On\nthe ground of this coincidence an illusion appears, that the energy E of dynamical system plays a role of the quantity, determining its evolution, i.e. the role of\nits Hamiltonian H. An illusion appears that the energy and the Hamiltonian are\nsynonyms, i.e. two different names of the same quantity.\nThis identification of energy and Hamiltonian is used in the relativistic quantum\ntheory, where such an identification cannot be used. For instance, it is common\npractice to consider [17], that in the dynamic system SKG , described by the KleinGordon equation, the particle energy may be both positive and negative. A ground\n\n17\n\n\ffor such an statement is the fact that the flat wave in SKG has the form\n\u03c8 = Aeik0 t\u2212ikx\n\n(5.2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the quantity k0 = m2 + k2 is interpreted as an energy. It may be both\npositive and negative. The statement that the energy may be negative is made in\nspite of the fact that the energy-momentum tensor component\nT 00 = m2 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8 + \u2207\u03c8 \u2217 \u2207\u03c8\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhich enters in the expression (5.1), takes only nonnegative values. In reality, the\nquantity k0 is a time component of the canonical momentum, which can have any\nsign. But the particle energy is always nonnegative.\nThus, in the given case one has the associative delusion (AD.7), which lies in\nthe fact that the properties of Hamiltonian are attributed to the energy. As long as\nsuch an identification is produced on the verbal level, it leads only to a confusion in\ninterpretation and nothing more. But in the quantum field theory (QFT) such an\nidentification has a mathematical form, and it has far-reaching consequences for the\nsecondary quantization of the scalar field \u03c8. In the relation\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n= H\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8H,\n\u2202t\n\n(5.4)\n\ndescribing evolution of the dynamic variable \u03c8 in the Heisenberg representation, the\nHamiltonian H is replaced by the energy (5.1), i.e. the relation (5.4) is written in\nthe form\n\u2202\u03c8\n= E\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8E\n(5.5)\ni~\n\u2202t\nThe relation (5.5) is an additional constraint which is not necessary for carrying out\nthe secondary quantization. (The secondary quantization may be produced without\nimposing the condition (5.5)). If the additional condition is imposed, one should test\nits compatibility with dynamic equations. Unfortunately, there is no understanding\nof such a test necessity. The condition (5.5) appears to be compatible with the\ndynamic equations only in the trivial case of the linear field \u03c8. For the nonlinear\nfield the condition (5.5) appears to be incompatible with dynamic equations that\nmanifests itself as the form of nonstationary vacuum state.\nTheory of the scalar field \u03c8, quantized in accord with the condition (5.5), is an\ninconsistent conception, which is convenient in the relation that it (as any inconsistent conception) admits one to explain some facts, which cannot be explained in\nthe scope of a consistent conception, which does not use the constraint (5.5).\nThe identification of the energy and Hamiltonian E = H (condition (5.5)) has\nbeen used in QFT during the second half of XX century, i.e. about 50 years. This\ncondition is not necessary for the secondary quantization, and its incompatibility\nwith dynamic equations is rather evident. Why was this condition not come under\na storm of criticism in this long time? In QFT there are many difficulties and\nproblems, and the QFT consistency was open to question many times. But the\n18\n\n\fcondition (5.5) had not to be in doubt. The author had discussed this question with\nexperts in QFT, but any time the their reaction was similar. The author opponents\ndid not adduce counter-arguments and agreed that the condition (5.5) is not too\nwell, but they rejected to make conclusions, concerning the second quantization\nprocedure. Put very simply, they searched for reasons of the QFT difficulties on its\nsurface, giving up to analyze the QFT foundations.\n\n6\n\nOn styles of investigation\n\nTheir considerations look approximately as follows. Let us introduce an additional\nsupposition and study its consequences for theory and experiment. If the consequences are positive, the additional supposition is accepted and introduced into\nthe theory. If the consequences are negative, the additional supposition is removed\nand a new additional supposition is considered. Such additional suppositions were:\nnormal ordering, renormalizations, increase of the space-time dimension with the\nsubsequent compactification, strings, etc. This style of investigation: additional\nsupposition with subsequent test of its consequences will be referred to as P-style\n(pragmatic style) of investigation. Such a style is characteristic not only for the QFT\ndevelopment. In the beginning of XX century the quantum mechanics development\nwas carried out also by means of P-style. The quantum mechanics developed, fighting against the classical style (C-style) of investigations, established to the end of\nXIX century. In this fight the P-style gained a victory over the C-style, which played\na role of representative of classical (nonquantum) physics. Successors of Ptolemeus\nused the P-style, whereas successors of Copernicus used the C-style. The competition of successors of Ptolemeus with the successors of Copernicus was at the same\ntime a competition between P-style and C-style. Then the C-style gained the victory.\nC-style reached its fullest flower to the end of XIX century. At the investigations of\nquantum phenomena in the XX century C-style gave the way to P-style.\nWhy do two different styles of investigation exist? Why does the investigation\nC-style or the investigation P-style gain alternatively the competition? The answer\nis as follows.\nC-style is a style of investigations in the scope of a consistent theory. It puts in\nthe forefront the consistency of a theory. C-style restricts suggestion of additional\nsuppositions (hypotheses), insisting, that additional suppositions be consistent with\nprimary principles of a theory. (Let us recall the Newton's words: \"I do not invent\nhypotheses\"). In virtue of its requirement rigidity the C-style has the more predictable force, than the P-style, where these requirements are not so rigid. Among\nthe C-style requirements there are ethic requirements to researchers. For instance, an\nresearcher, which publishes insufficiently founded paper, containing arbitrary (i.e.\nnot following from the primary principles) suppositions, risks losing his scientific\nface.\nAdherents of the C-style pay attention to fundamental problems of a theory, and\nin particular, to results and predictions of the theory, which are important for its\n19\n\n\ffurther development. Solutions of concrete practical problems are considered to be\nnot so important, because a solution of any special problem is a formal application\nof primary principles and mathematical technique to conditions of the new problem,\nand nothing beyond this. Such a relation of the researcher, using the C-style, to a\nsolution of special problems is founded on his confidence that the primary principles\nare valid and the theory is consistent.\nThe predictability of the C-style, rigidity of its requirements and its self-reliance\nare true, provided the primary principles of a theory are true. If the primary principles contain a mistake, some predictions of the theory appears to be false. It forces\nonto searching for a mistake, which may occurs in the primary principles or in the\nconclusion of corollaries from them. The most frequently a mistake is discovered in\nincorrect application of the primary principles.\nBut if the mistake in conclusions of a theory (discrepancy between predictions\nof the theory and experiment) has not been discovered for a long time, the necessity of the cognition progress and necessity of improvement of the terminology\nfor the experimental data description generate a more pragmatic style (P-style) of\ninvestigations.\nThe P-style puts in the forefront a possibility of the experimental data explanation, what is obtained usually by introduction of additional suppositions. The\ntheory consistency is considered to be not so important. although the representatives of the P-style declare, that they tend to elimination of inconsistencies, but it\ndoes not succeeded always, and is considered to be a less defect, than impossibility\nof the experiment explanation. The P-style admits an introduction of additional\nsuppositions, even if they appear to be inconsistent with primary principles. It is\nimportant only, that they were useful and led to explanation of experimental data.\nThe P-style imposes essentially more slight requirements to researchers. For instance, the scientific reputation of a researcher does not lack or lacks slightly, if\nhe, writing a very good paper, writes thereafter several mediocre or even incorrect\npapers. Predictability of the P-style is essentially less, than that of the C-style, as\nfar as P-style admits only a \"short logic\" (short logical chain of considerations). For\ninstance, it is widely believed among researchers dealing with quantum theory that\nessentially new result can be obtained, only suggesting some essentially new supposition in the scope of quantum theory. The idea that a novelty may be found in the\nprimary principles (i.e. outside the scope of quantum theory) and the new result is\na corollary of a long logical chain of considerations is perceived as something unreal.\nPragmatism of the P-style manifests itself in setting in the forefront a solution of\nconcrete practical problems. It is supposed that a young talent gifted researcher is\nto solve concrete problems, whereas solution of fundamental problems is supposed\nto be a work for elderly experienced researchers. According to such a viewpoint\nusually one ignores and does not discuss facts and results which are important for\nfurther development of a theory, but which do not deal directly with its practical\napplications. Behind such a relation one can see an uncertainty of the P-style\nrepresentatives in the primary principles of a theory and in its consistency. If a\npractical problem fails to be solved, the P-style representatives are ready to suggest\n20\n\n\fadditional suppositions and even to revise the primary principles.\nThe P-style appears to be more effective, only if the C-style appears to be ineffective. The last takes place, if the primary principles contain either mistake or\ndefect. In other words, the C-style is more effective, than the P-style only at absence of obstacles (systematic noise). The P-style is noise-resistant, under presence\nof the \"systematical noise\" it appears to be more effective, than the C-style. In\nthe period of a long P-style dominance a theory degenerates. Accumulating many\nadditional supposition, contradicting each other, the theory gives up step-by-step\nits predictable force and capacity of valid development. Situation was such in the\ntime of dominance of the Ptolemaic doctrine. The same situation takes place now\nin the quantum field theory.\nIn general, the C-style is more effective and predictable, provided the primary\nprinciples are valid. The P-style is useful in the relation, that it works even in the\ncase, when there is a mistake in the primary principles, and C-style cannot work. In\nthis case the P-style admits one to introduce new adequate concepts and terminology\nfor descriptions of experiments that cannot be explained by the theory, based on the\nprimary principles. Finally, investigations, realized by means of the P-style, help\none to discover mistake in the choice of primary principles and produce a necessary\nrevision.\nAny style of investigations is conservative. It is worked out by a researcher in\nthe course of all his research activity. If the researcher used the P-style, i.e. he uses\nessentially the trial and error method, he gets accustomed hardly to rigid restrictions of the C-style. Vice versa, a researcher, using the C-style in his work, gets\naccustomed to work with consistent conceptions. It is very difficult for him to pass\nto more free P-style and to invent new additional supposition which are necessary\nfor explanations of new experiments. Conservatism of the investigation style leads\nto a conflict, when the dominating investigation style changes. For instance, in the\ntime of Ptolemeus the P-style dominated. Discovery of AD.2 needed to construct a\nconsistent conception of the celestial mechanics which would be free of arbitrary suppositions. The conflict between the successors of Ptolemeus and those of Copernicus\nwas in the same time a conflict between the investigation styles.\nNow practically all researchers dealing with relativistic QFT use P-style. They\nperceive difficultly arguments of the C-style proponents, having found inconsistencies\nand mistakes in primary principles of the quantum theory.\n\n7\n\nHistory of the associative delusions overcoming\n\nAssociative delusions have rather unusual properties. Usually they are overcame\nunintentionally. As a rule, the associative delusions are discovered and realized\nonly after they have been overcame. Overcoming of AD.2 (conflict between the\nCopernicus doctrine and the Ptolemaic one) continues for several decades. Both\nsides of the conflict understood very well the reason of disagreement, but the fact,\nthat this reason was an associative delusion, was interesting for nobody.\n21\n\n\fThe following associative delusion AD.3 (the Cartesian coordinate system as a\nfundamental object of geometry) had been overcame in the course of the second half\nof XIX century. Its overcoming appeared to be not noticed in the sense that the\nreason of conflicts in the scientific community remained to be obscure. In the case\nof AD.2 it was clear, what was a subject of disagreement. In the case of AD.3 the\nreason of the conflict remained to be not clear. The mathematical community did not\naccept non-Euclidean geometry. There is the evidence of Felix Klein [18]. It is known\nalso that the Russian mathematical community related with a prejudice to works\nof N.I. Lobachevski on the geometry of negative curvature and to N.I. Lobachevski\nhimself as an author of these works [19]. Unfortunately, the reasons of this prejudice\nhad not been analyzed (at any case such an analysis is not known for us), and this\nepisode remained in the history of mathematics as an unclear flash of conservatism.\nAssociative delusions AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 are found at the stage of overcoming. On\none hand, an objective analysis of methods of AD overcomings is very difficult. On\nthe other hand, such an analysis is necessary, because it would make overcoming of\nAD.4 \u2013 AD.7 easier. Besides AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 are not the last associative delusions on\nthe way of the cognition process. Investigation of properties of associative delusions\ncould help one to overcome the next AD.\nAD.4 \u2013 AD.7 were discovered and overcame by one person \u2013 the author of this\npaper. Discovery and overcoming of ADs is rather rare processes. In this connection\nit is very difficult to answer the questions of the type. With what is a discovery of\nADs connected? What are the circumstances, at which the discovery of ADs takes\nplace? Why do some researchers succeed in overcoming of ADs, whereas other do\nfail?\nMotives and attendant circumstances are known usually only for those researchers,\nwho participated directly in overcoming of AD (in the given case this is the author of\nthe paper). The process of overcoming was rather long (about 40 years). The diary\nwas not kept, and one is forced to entrust to recollections. But the human memory is\nnot enough reliable. The human beings are apt to forget events and circumstances,\nespecially, if they are unpleasant for them. A subconscious mythologization of the\ninvestigation process takes place. But recollections of the only direct participant of\nthe process of the ADs discovery and overcoming are of a certain interest for further investigations of associative delusions, even if they are subjective and strongly\nmythologized. Such recollections are of interest for subsequent investigators even in\nthe case, if their author had not understood, or had understood incorrectly, what\nhe had done in reality. The recollections are unique and are of interest, even if their\nauthor had described instead of important circumstances some unessential details,\nwhich he remembers for some reasons.\nExperience of overcoming of AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 evidences that in some case the overcoming of associative delusion happens to be accidental, or it is an accessory result\nof investigations, carried out with other goal. In other cases ADs appear to be\nconnected with insufficient understanding of the existing theory (in particular, the\nrelativity theory), and overcoming of AD is carried out consciously. However, taking part in the process of the AD overcoming, it is very difficult one to analyze\n22\n\n\fobjectively this process. Apparently, the objective analysis will be possible only,\nwhen the process of the AD overcoming has been over. The author can make his\ncontribution to this analysis only by one way \u2013 he should tell, how from his viewpoint the process of this overcoming passed. Of course, one can produce this analyze\non the ground of published papers. But in this case one cannot take into account\nmotives of the paper writing and the important circumstance, that sometimes the\nobtained results differ from those ones that the author wanted to obtain. Motives\nand goals of the author are unessential for estimation of his contribution, but they\nare essential for investigation of the cognition process (analyses of the process of the\nAD overcoming).\nIn general, recollection should be printed in the memoirs, but not in the scientific\npaper. In the given case there is the excuse that the question is connected not only\nwith recollections, but with recollections accompanied by formulae. Besides the\nquestion is about evidences (maybe, very subjective), concerning very rare cognition\nprocess, which is the AD overcoming.\nThus, evidences of the participant will be presented. They are presented from\nthe first person singular, in order to underline subjective character of recollection\nand separate them from other part of presentation, which pretends to objectivity.\nThe evidences of participant do pretend by no means to a review of investigations,\nconnected with overcoming of AD.4 \u2013 AD.7, and all references to other researchers\nare cited so far as they influenced the participant investigations and remained in his\nmemory.\n\n8\n\nBeginning of AD.4 overcoming.\nparticipant.\n\nEvidence of\n\nThe idea that the space-time is described completely by interval (distance) between\npairs of events appeared at once after my acquaintance with the relativity theory. (It\ntook place in 1955, when I was a second-year student). I supposed that all experts\nthought the same and did not see nothing new and surprising in such a point of view.\n(Some physicists told me many years ago, that they hold the same viewpoint). I\nwas somewhat surprised that the infinitesimal interval was used (but not finite). I\nexplained this fact to myself that it was easier to work with infinitesimal interval,\nbecause it contained less information (functions of one space-time point), than the\nfinite interval (function of two space-time points). At first, I did not understand the\ncircumstance, that an introduction of an infinitesimal interval is impossible without\nintroduction of the dimension and manifold. I considered the dimension and the\nmanifold to be natural attributes of the space-time.\nSome years later I undertook a study of that, to what extent the space-time\ncould be described in terms of a finite interval. The finite interval was attractive\nby the fact, that it contains more information, than the infinitesimal one. For\ninstance, a geodesic, described usually by a system of four ordinary second order\ndifferential equations, is described in terms of the finite interval S (x, x\u2032 ) as a solution\n23\n\n\fx\u2032 = xi (\u03c4 ) , i = 0, 1, 2, 3 of a system of four algebraic equations\n\u2202G (x, x\u2032 )\n= bi\u2032 \u03c4,\n\u2202x\u2032i\u2032\n\nbi\u2032 = const,\n\n1\nG (x, x\u2032 ) = S 2 (x, x\u2032 )\n2\n\n(8.1)\n\nThe quantity, which is denoted now via \u03c3 and known as the world function, I\ndenoted by G. For me this designation associated with gravitation. The quantities,\ndepending on two space-time points, I denoted by capital letters.\nIt should note that I had worked out somewhat unusual and, as I am understanding now, unpleasant for my colleagues style of work. The style of my work was such\na kind, that before undertaking an investigation I had not studied or had studied\nvery slightly works of my predecessors. I connect appearance of such a style with\nthe fact, that in the course of my studying at the university I had practically no\nscientific advisor, who could give me a definite theme for investigations and press on\nso that I investigated it. Of course, I had an official scientific advisor. He suggested\nme a theme for a diploma work and for the Ph.D. thesis. But I was a self-willed\nstudent. I ignored recommendations of my scientific advisor and investigated those\nsubjects, which I considered to be interesting and necessary. My scientific advisor,\nqualifying me as a \"non-controlled student\" did not insist on his choice of the subject\nof investigation and does not hinder my self-will in the choice of the investigation\nsubject. Moreover, he supported me by all means in my work.\nUsually the scientific advisor suggests the subject for investigation and related\nliterature. Doing so he guarantees that this work will not be a rediscovery of known\nresults. I began my investigation of the finite interval properties (world function),\nas if such investigations had not been produced earlier. I knew nothing about them,\nand nobody of my colleagues could tell me anything about such investigations.\nInvestigation was made in spring and in summer of 1958, when I was five-year\nstudent of the physical faculty of the Moscow Lomonosov university.\nUnderstanding possibility of rediscovery of known results, I tended subconsciously to prevent such a rediscovery. To eliminate the rediscovery, I must bring\nmy investigation to obtaining of certainly new and interesting result. The possibility that my intermediate results appeared to overlap already known results, has\nnot agitated me2 . I ignored the evident way of investigation of the world function\nG (x, x\u2032 ) \u2013 expansion into a series over powers of x \u2212 x\u2032 and paid attention on the\n\u2032\ncircumstance that the quantity \u0393ikl (x, x\u2032 ) \u2261 Gis Gkl,s\u2032 is a scalar at the point x\u2032 and\nthe Christoffel symbol at the point x. Here the following designations are used\nGkl\u2032 \u2261\n\n\u22022G\n,\n\u2202xk \u2202x\u2032l\u2032\n\nGkl,s\u2032 \u2261\n\n\u22023G\n\u2202xk \u2202xl \u2202x\u2032s\u2032\n\n(8.2)\n\n\u2032\n\nand Gis is the matrix reciprocal to the matrix Gkl\u2032 .\nMoreover, it appeared that \u0393ikl (x, x\u2032 ) is the Christoffel symbol for a flat space, i.e.\nthe Riemann \u2013 Christoffel curvature tensor for \u0393ikl (x, x\u2032 ) is equal to zero identically.\n2\n\nI guessed that it is not very ethically not to refer to my predecessors and tried not to admit\nthis. But the fact that absence of references to predecessors disoriented the readers, which are\nacquainted at first with this subject, did not come to my mind. I shall know about this a bit later.\n\n24\n\n\fAs a result it appeared that one could introduce such a covariant derivative with\nrespect to xi , which was a covariant derivative in some flat space and which depended\non a parameter \u2013 the point x\u2032 .\nAll this meant, that the world function and the Riemannian space V , which was\ndescribed by it, were associated with a set of flat spaces Ex\u2032 , labelled by the point x\u2032\nof the Riemannian space V . Investigation of this question showed that the spaces Ex\u2032\nwere flat spaces tangent to the Riemannian space V at the point x\u2032 . It appeared that\nthe world function generated automatically some two-metric technique, realizing a\ngeodesic mapping of the Riemannian space V onto Ex\u2032 . Moreover, it was discovered\nlater on [20], that such a mapping was realized by any symmetric scalar function\n\u2032\nG (x, x\u2032 ) of two points, for which one could determine the tensor Gis . But in that\ntime I had not known this result and did not think about a possibility of coming\noutside the scope of Riemannian geometry.\nBy the way, results of the work admitted one to make this already then. The\nmost evident result of the work was a construction of the two-metric technique on\nthe basis of the world function. It was the result that impressed my colleagues\nmostly. I myself considered that the main result of the paper was an obtaining of\na system of differential equations for the world function of Riemannian space. The\nequation, which is satisfied by the world function \u03c3 of the Riemannian space is well\nknown [21].\n\u2202\u03c3 ik\n\u2202\u03c3\ng (x) k = 2\u03c3\n(8.3)\ni\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nIt contains the metric tensor of the Riemannian space in an explicit form, and it\ncannot serve as an equation, splitting all symmetric functions G (x, x\u2032 ) into two sets:\none set contains the functions, which can be a world function of a Riemannian space,\nanother set contains functions G (x, x\u2032 ), which cannot play this role.\nUsing the two-metric technique, one succeeded to eliminate the metric tensor\nfrom the equation (8.3) and obtain a system of differential equations for the world\nfunction, which did not contain metric tensor explicitly, but in return it contained\nderivatives of the world function with respect to both arguments x and x\u2032 [22]. The\nworld function of any Riemannian space satisfied this system of equations.\nThe system of equations put the question. What is described by the world\nfunction, which does not satisfy this system? Does it describe non-Riemannian\ngeometry, or no geometry at all? In that time (in the beginning of sixtieths) I did\nnot put this question, but I considered derivation of this system of equations as a\nmain result of my work. My attempts to call attention of my colleagues to this\nresult did not lead to a success. Agreeing that the development of the two-metric\ntechnique was a progress, they were indifferent to the system of equations for the\nworld function of a Riemannian space, that was considered by me as the main result.\nThe paper was published in slightly known journal [22] in 1962, almost three years\nafter it had been submitted. In the time between the submission and publication\nsome very important for me event happened. The book by J.L. Synge [21], where\nat first the general relativity was presented in terms of the world function, appeared\nin Moscow. I had learned from it that the world function was introduced at first by\n25\n\n\fH.S. Ruse [23] and J.L Synge [24] practically simultaneously, and that its properties\nhad been investigated.\nBut the book by J.L. Synge did not contain any information on two-metric\ntechnique and geodesic mapping on tangent spaces Ex\u2032 . My misgivings that results\nof my investigations would appear to be a rediscovery of known results were not\njustified. Moreover, my study of the book by J.L. Synge led to increase of my\nself-reliance. If being a student, I could without a help make an investigation and\nobtained the results, which had not been obtained by so experienced researcher as\nJ.L. Synge, it meant that I was able to compete with any researchers. Further this\nincrease of my self-reliance will help me in my investigations. This case validated\nmy style of working, when I did not troubled myself with study of the literature,\npostponing this to the time, when the first results deserving publication would be\nobtained. I used such a style of work, because I preferred to develop a new direction,\nbut not to continue investigations of my predecessors. At first, it was easier, and,\nsecond, an attentive study of literature influenced me very strongly. It pushed\nme to a beaten way and prevented from a choice of directions of investigations,\nnatural from my viewpoint. These directions appeared sometimes to be alternative\nto conventional directions of investigations.\nUntil 1964 I had written several papers about the two-metric technique applications to gravitation and several papers on the unified field theory. Dealing with\nthe unified field theory, I was led to conclusion that all universal phenomena and\nuniversal constants were a manifestation of the space-time properties. For instance,\nI was sure (and I am sure now) that multiplicity of any electric charge to elementary\none was conditioned by the space-time properties, as well as the quantum constant\n~ was the space-time attribute. Besides to the end of 1964 I was convinced that\none cannot succeed in the study of the space-time properties without understanding\nwhat was the quantization. This (and other circumstances) forced me to leave the\nMoscow Lomonosov university and to change a subject of my investigations.\n\n9\n\nRelativistic statistics and overcoming of AD.5,\nAD.6. Evidence of participant.\n\nSince 1964 I stopped to deal with geometry, gravitation, and unified field theory. In\nseveral years I was dealing with applied physics, and in the beginning of seventieths I\nstarted to develop the direction, which I called \"quantum mechanics as a relativistic\nstatistics\". It is this direction, whose development is connected with overcoming of\nAD.5. Then I assumed that the quantum mechanics was a result of statistical description of randomly moving particles. It seemed to me very reasonable in the light\nof the fact that in the end of XIX century the thermal phenomena were explained\nsuccessfully as a result of statistical description of chaotically moving molecules. I\nassumed that the quantum phenomena could be explained in the same way. This\nidea was not new, but numerous attempts to realize this program did not led to a\nsuccess. As far as know, most of researchers considered this program to be wrong.\n26\n\n\fThey assumed that the quantum properties reflected \"quantum nature\" of the world\nand that they could not be reduced to other \"classical\" properties.\nI did assume that failure of the statistical description was connected with the\nnonrelativistic character of the statistical description. I assumed that although the\nquantum mechanics was nonrelativistic, but nevertheless, the statistical description\nwas to be relativistic. In my opinion, the fact that the regular component of the\nparticle motion was relativistic did not mean that the stochastic component was\nnonrelativistic also. To be on the safe side, one was to use a relativistic statistical\ndescription, which should be valid independently of the case, whether the stochastic\ncomponent of motion be relativistic or not.\nBeing a student, I studied the relativity theory, reading the book by V.A. Fock\n[25], and shared his viewpoint that the relativistic theory differed from the nonrelativistic one not only in relativistic invariance of their dynamic equations. As it is\nwell known, the main difference between the special relativity theory (SRT) and the\nnonrelativistic physics lies in the fact that in the nonrelativistic physics there are the\nconcept of simultaneity in remote points, whereas in SRT there is no such a simultaneity. It means essentially that the nonrelativistic physics is incompatible with\nthe relativistic physics. But a compromise between the relativity and nonrelativistic\nphysics was strongly necessary, as far as the physics remained to be mainly nonrelativistic. Presentation of the whole nonrelativistic physics in the relativistic form,\nto take only into account small relativistic corrections, seemed to be unacceptable.\nOne found a compromise. A concept of the relative simultaneity (simultaneity on a\ngiven coordinate system) was introduced. Thus, on one hand, the simultaneity was\nconsidered as though it were, and nonrelativists were satisfied. On the other hand\nthe simultaneity was relative. It was considered as though it was not exist, and\nrelativists were satisfied also. On one hand, for nonrelativists this compromise facilitated a transition to relativistic physics, admitting them to conserve nonrelativistic\nstyle of thinking at description of relativistic processes. But on the other hand, it\nwas this style of thinking that hindered investigation of physical phenomena, whose\nrelativistic character was not evident.\nUnfortunately, this restricted character of the compromise, connected with application of the relative simultaneity, was understood only by a few physicists. Practically all textbooks on the relativity theory were written on the ground of this\ncompromise. Apparently, it is this compromise that is a reason why most of researches ignored application of space-time diagram in their investigations. Usually\ndescription was produced in terms of coordinate systems and relativistic invariance\nof dynamic equations. In other words, most of researchers thought in terms of Newtonian mechanics with corrections for relativistic invariance. Such an approach did\nnot help to investigate relativistic phenomena, and J.L. Synge wrote about this in\nthe preface to his book [21]. As for me, as well as J.L. Synge I thought in terms of\nspace-time diagrams, i.e. in terms of space-time geometry.\nI assumed that the probability theory could not be used for statistical description\nof relativistic stochastic particles, as far as concept of the particle state is different\nin SRT and in the nonrelativistic physics. In SRT the physical object, connected\n27\n\n\fwith the particle is WL (world line). The fundamental concept, connected with\nthe particle, is WL. The WL is primary, and a particle is an attribute of WL.\nThe particle is a section of WL by the hyperplane t =const. These sections are\ndifferent in different coordinate systems, especially if there are several WLs. In the\nnonrelativistic physics a particle is a physical object, and world line is its attribute\n(history).\nThe most difference between the two approches appears at description of the pair\nproduction and pair annihilation. If the physical object is WL, the turn of world\nlines in the time direction, when the time coordinate x0 is not a monotone function of\nthe parameter \u03c4 along WL, does not provoke objections. But if the physical object is\na particle, which is described in the terms of some dynamic system, an annihilation\nof the particle together with the dynamic system describing it is considered to be an\nabsurd from the viewpoint of classical mechnics principles. The classical mechanics\ndoes not consider production and annihilation of dynamic systems, and the pair\nproduction process can be understood only from viewpoint of quantum mechanics.\nDescription of a physical object is divided into two parts: (1) the object state\nand (2) dynamic equations, describing the state evolution. Dynamics is insensitive\nto the method of decomposition into state and dynamic equations. For dynamics it\nis of no importance what is a physical object: WL, or a particle. Vice versa, the\nstatistical description is a calculus of states, and it is very important for it, what\nis the physical object and what is a state of this object. Different choice of the\nphysical object and different decomposition into state and dynamic equations lead\nto different results.\nThe probability theory is suitable for calculus of the particle states, but not\nfor states of WLs. But, it is a long way from understanding, that the probability\ntheory is incompatible with the statistical description of relativistic particles, up to\na construction of statistical description without probability.\nUnderstanding that the density of states of world lines is described by the 4vector j i , I tried to formulate the quantum mechanics in terms of 4-vector j i , i.e. to\nobtain that which was called hydrodynamical interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nI tried to develop a mathematical technique, which could convert the state density j i\ninto a fundamental object of a theory, making the wave function to be an attribute of\nthis object. I succeeded to state the statistical principle, determining construction of\nthe statistical description [26]. Essentially, the statistical description was formulated\nas follows. At the statistical description one considers many independent stochastic\nparticles. They form something like a gas or a fluid, whose state is described by the\nmean 4-flux of particles j i , i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Thus, one overcame AD.5 (consisting in\nthe statement that a use of the probability theory is a necessary condition of the\nstatistical description). To derive the quantum mechanics it was necessary to pass\nfrom j i to the wave function \u03c8. At this point a purely mathematical problem arose.\nThe fact is that the transition from the wave function to a hydrodynamics with\nthe vector j i , is well known [14]. But it leads to a irrotational flow, i.e. to a very\nspecial case of the flow. It was known how to construct the wave function for the\nirrotational flow. But how to make this in the case of arbitrary flow? It was a\n28\n\n\fcomplicated mathematical problem, which had taken a long time and many efforts.\nBut finally it had been solved. It appeared that it was necessary to integrate the\ncomplete system of hydrodynamic equations, i.e. the system, consisting of the Euler\nequations and dynamic equations, describing displacement of the fluid particles in\nthe given velocity field (so called Lin constraints). As a result of this integration\nthe order of the system reduced, arbitrary integration functions appeared, and the\nsystem became to be described in terms of Clebsch potentials. Thereafter one could\nintroduce many-component wave function, which appeared as an attribute of the\nfluid description.\nThis result was obtained in the middle of eightieths, and was applied at first to\nhydrodynamics [27]. Thereafter the mathematical technique of dynamical conception of statistical description (DCSD) appeared. The wave functions turned to an\nattribute of the statistical description, and many unsolved problems became solvable.\nIt should note here, that there were numerous attempts to revise and to interpret\nthe quantum mechanics in other way (see. [14, 28, 30, 31, 32] and references therein).\nAll authors of these papers started from the wave function and Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\ntrying to give another more acceptable meaning to quantum quantities. As a result\nthey obtained different interpretations of the quantum mechanics and nothing more,\nbecause the wave function remained to be a fundamental object of a theory. Turning\nthe wave function to an attribute of statistical description, I deprived it the status\nof a fundamental object. As a result another conception, but not simply another\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics appeared.\nThe solved problem was a problem of the hydrodynamics (mechanics of continuous medium) The hydrodynamics was such a field of physics, where I was not an\nexpert. In that time I was working at the laboratory, where practically all researchers\nwere hydrodynamicists. I reported my work on hydrodynamics at the session of a\nseminar of our laboratory. Hearing my report, hydrodynamicists of our laboratory\nwere puzzled, because they did not see a result in my report. There, where I saw integration with appearance of three arbitrary functions, they saw only a complicated\nchange of variables. There was a reason for such a viewpoint. I present briefly an\nessence of the problem, because it seems to me very important for understanding,\nwhat is the delusion and how it have been overcame.\nMotion of ideal compressible fluid is described usually by five Euler equations\nfor five dependent variables velocity v, density \u03c1 and entropy S\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207(\u03c1v) = 0\n\u2202t\n1\n\u2202v\n+ (v\u2207)v = \u2212 \u2207p,\n\u2202t\n\u03c1\n\n(9.1)\np = \u03c12\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202\u03c1\n\n(9.2)\n\n\u2202S\n+ (v\u2207)S = 0\n(9.3)\n\u2202t\nHere p is the pressure, and E = E(\u03c1, S) is the internal energy per unit mass,\n29\n\n\fconsidered to be a function of density \u03c1 and entropy S. The internal energy E =\nE(\u03c1, S) is a unique characteristic of the ideal fluid.\nOn one hand, the Euler equations form a closed system of dynamic equations,\nbut on the other hand, they do not form a complete system of dynamic equations,\ndescribing dynamic system Sfl , called ideal fluid. To obtain a complete description,\none needs to add more three equations, describing displacement of the fluid particles\nin the given field of velocity v(t, x). It can be made, adding so called Lin constraints\n[33]\n\u2202\u03be\n+ (v\u2207)\u03be = 0,\n(9.4)\n\u2202t\nwhere Lagrangian variables \u03be = \u03be(t, x) = {\u03be\u03b1 (t, x)}, \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 are considered to\nbe functions of independent variables t, x. If one solves the equations (9.4) and\ndetermine \u03be as functions of (t, x), the finite relations\n\u03be(t, x) = \u03be in = const\n\n(9.5)\n\ndescribe implicitly the particle trajectories and motion of particles along them.\nThe Lagrangian coordinates \u03be label the fluid particles, as far as they represent\nthree independent integrals of the system of ordinary differential equations.\ndx\n= v(t, x),\ndt\n\nx = x(t, \u03be),\n\n(9.6)\n\ndescribing the particle displacement in the given velocity field. The Lin constraints\n(9.4) are equivalent to the system (9.6) of three ordinary differential equations, and\nhydrodynamicists do not consider them seriously, supposing that the main problem\nis a solution of the Euler equations. If they are solved, i.e. if the system of five\npartial differential equations has been solved, the subsequent solution of the system\nof three ordinary differential equations is essentially much easier problem. Essentially, there is no necessity to solve equations (9.6), as far as the system of Euler\nequations is closed, and one can find the fluid flow independently of equations (9.6).\nThe displacement of fluid particles in itself, described by the equations (9.6), is not\ninteresting for hydrodynamicists. All this led to that situation, when hydrodynamicists ignore the Lin constraints both in the form (9.4) and in the form (9.6). In\naction it led to the fact, that one tried to write the variational principle for the\nclosed system of equations (9.1) \u2013 (9.3), but not for the dynamic system Sfl . It is\nimpossible to write the variational principle for the closed system of equations (9.1)\n\u2013 (9.3). One succeeded to make this only after adding the Lin constraints (9.4) [34].\nThe complete system of dynamic equations (9.1) \u2013 (9.4) is invariant with respect\nto the relabelling of the fluid particles. It means, that the relabelling transformation\nof the fluid particles\n\u03be\u03b1 \u2192 \u03be \u0303\u03b1 = \u03be \u0303\u03b1 (\u03be),\n\nD \u2261 det k \u2202 \u03be \u0303\u03b1 /\u2202\u03be\u03b2 k6= 0,\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3\n\n(9.7)\n\ndoes not change the form of the system of equations (9.1) \u2013 (9.4), i.e. the relabelling\ngroup (9.7) is a symmetry group of the complete system of equations (9.1) \u2013 (9.4).\n30\n\n\fApplication of the curtailed system of equations (9.1) \u2013 (9.3) admits one to ignore\nlabelling \u03be of the fluid particles and carry out the description in terms of relabellinginvariant variables \u03c1, v, S.\nThere is a method of simplifying the complete system of dynamic equations (9.1)\n\u2013 (9.4), other, than ignoring the variables \u03be and description in terms of relabellinginvariant variables \u03c1, v, S. Using the fact that the relabelling group (9.7) is a symmetry group of dynamic equations, one can integrate the complete system of dynamic\nequations (9.1) \u2013 (9.4) in the form\nS(t, x) = S0 (\u03be)\n\u03c1(t, x) = \u03c10 (\u03be)\n\n\u2202(\u03be)\n\u2202(\u03be1 , \u03be2, \u03be3 )\n\u2261 \u03c10 (\u03be)\n1\n2\n3\n\u2202(x , x , x )\n\u2202(x)\n\n(9.8)\n(9.9)\n\nv(t, x) = u(\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, S) \u2261 \u2207\u03c6 + g \u03b1(\u03be)\u2207\u03be\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7\u2207S,\n\n(9.10)\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n1\n\u2202(\u03c1E)\n+ u(\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, S)\u2207\u03c6 \u2212 [u(\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, S)]2 +\n=0\n\u2202t\n2\n\u2202\u03c1\n\n(9.11)\n\nwhere S0 (\u03be), \u03c10 (\u03be) and g(\u03be) = {g \u03b1 (\u03be)}, \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 are arbitrary functions of the\nargument \u03be, and \u03c6, \u03b7 are new dependent variables, satisfying the dynamic equations\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202\u03b7\n+ u(\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, S)\u2207\u03b7 = \u2212\n.\n(9.12)\n\u2202t\n\u2202S\nIf five dependent variables \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7 satisfy the system of equations (9.4), (9.11),\n(9.12), the five dynamic variables S, \u03c1, v (9.8)\u2013(9.10) satisfy the dynamic equations\n(9.1)\u2013(9.3). The indefinite functions S0 (\u03be), \u03c10 (\u03be), and g \u03b1 (\u03be) can be determined\nfrom initial and boundary conditions in such a way, that the initial and boundary\nconditions for variables \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7 would be universal in the sense that they do not\ndepend on the fluid flow.\nThe last condition means that at the description in terms of hydrodynamic potentials the total information on the fluid flow is contained in dynamic equations,\nand there is no necessity in giving the initial and boundary conditions, because they\nmay be universal. At the description in terms of relabelling-invariant variables S, \u03c1,\nv one needs to add initial and boundary conditions to dynamic equations to obtain\nall information on the fluid flow. The circumstance that dynamic equations (9.11),\n(9.12) contain initial and boundary conditions, introduced by means of (9.10), is\nunique. In accord with (9.9), (9.10) the physical quantities \u03c1, v are obtained as\na result of differentiation of variables \u03c6, \u03be, S, and the variables \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7 may be\ninterpreted as hydrodynamic potentials. This way of description can be called as\ndescription in terms of hydrodynamic potentials. These potentials associate with\nthe name of Clebsch [35, 36], who has introduced them for a description of incompressible fluid.\nThus, ignoring the potentials \u03be, one came to a description in terms of relabellinginvariant variables \u03c1, v, S by means of five equations (9.1)\u2013(9.3). Description in\nterms of hydrodynamic potentials \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7 led to a description by means of five equations (9.4), (9.11), (9.12). It seems that the system of equations (9.1)\u2013(9.3) on one\n31\n\n\fhand, and equations (9.4), (9.11), (9.12) on the other hand, can be derived one\nfrom other by means of a change of variables. The circumstance, that the change\nof variables was differential in one direction, and it was integral in other direction,\nwas not taken into account.\nHowever, it is very important circumstance. Differentiation of potentials \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7\nat the change of variables leads to a loss of information on the fluid particle displacements, described by the equations (9.4). The wave function contains complete\ninformation on motion and displacement of the fluid particles, and it can be built\nonly of potentials \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, and it cannot be built of relabelling-invariant variables\n\u03c1, v, S. Understanding of this circumstance appeared to be difficult for me and for\nother researchers. The last manifested itself in the fact that, when (in 1998) my\npaper on integration of hydrodynamic equations was submitted to Journal of Fluid\nDynamics. It was declined on the ground that in the reviewer's opinion the transition from the curtailed system of dynamic equations (9.1)\u2013(9.3) to the complete\nsystem (9.4), (9.11), (9.12) does not contain an integration, but only a change of\nvariables.\nWhy did I succeeded to construct a fluid description in terms of the wave function\nand to solve the problem of hydrodynamics, where I was an undoubted amateur?\nI reflected on this question and came to the following conclusion. At first, I knew\nwhat I do search for and had made many unsuccessful attempts. In the course\nof these attempts I developed and improved the mathematical technique of work\nwith Jacobians (Jacobian technique). Looking some years ago through papers of\nClebsch [35, 36], I have discovered that he also used the Jacobian technique and had\ndiscovered hydrodynamic potentials. He wrote down Jacobians in the expanded\nform, as it was usual in that time. Due to this the formalism was rather bulky, but\nI think, that Clebsch was able to discover description in terms of wave functions, if\nthere were a necessity for this. Second, I investigated the fluid simply as a dynamic\nsystem, as far as I did not know hydrodynamics. In return, I was not burdened\nwith prejudices, connected with a knowledge of hydrodynamics. In particular, in\nhydrodynamics the variables \u03be are well known as Lagrangian coordinates, which\nare used only as independent variables. I had met the Lagrangian coordinates as\ndependent variables only once in the book by V.A. Fock [25], when I studied the\nrelativity theory, being a second-year student. I remember very well, that I was\nsurprised by capacities, included in such a description.\nReturning to the problem of overcoming of AD.5 and AD.6, I should like to\nnote, that both delusions were overcame practically in the beginning of seventieths.\nHaving perceived, that the statistical description can and must be constructed on\na dynamical basis (without a use of the probability theory) meant overcoming of\nAD.5. Overcoming of AD.6 was a corollary of the fact, that the quantum mechanics\nis a statistical conception (statistical description of randomly moving particles).\n\n32\n\n\f10\n\nForced identification E = H. Evidence of\nparticipant on overcoming of AD.7\n\nOvercoming of AD.7 (Forced identification E = H) was the first of my overcomings\nof AD. It took place in 1970. It was carried out consciously on basis of understanding\nthat in the relativistic theory a physical object is world line (WL)3 , but not a\npointlike particle in the three-dimensional space. I took this truth from the book\nof V. A. Fock. [25]. Later I found confirmation of this viewpoint in papers of\nStueckelberg [37] and Feynman [38]. In general such a viewpoint was in keeping\nwith my style of geometrical thinking. This brought up the question: \"Is it possible\nto describe pair production in terms of classical relativistic mechanics?\" The pair\nproduction process is described by a turn of a world line in the time direction. It\nwas well known. It was necessary to invent such an external field which could carry\nout this turn. It was clear, that adding an arbitrary field to the action of charged\nparticle in a given electromagnetic field Ai\nZ n\no\np\ne\ndq\u0307\nq\u0307 \u2261\n(10.1)\nA [q] =\n\u2212mc gik q\u0307 i q\u0307 k + Ai q\u0307 i d\u03c4,\nc\nd\u03c4\none could not carry out such a turn. The fact is that, at the turn in time the world\nline becomes to be spacelike near the turning point. On the other hand, under the\nsign of radical in (10.1) must be a nonnegative quantity. It means, that gik q\u0307 i q\u0307 k \u2265 0\nand, hence the world line is to be timelike (or null). In order the world line might\nbe spacelike, the external field is to be introduced under sign of radical in (10.1).\nThen the expression under sign of radical may be positive even in the case, when\ngik q\u0307 i q\u0307 k < 0. I introduced the external field under the sign of radical, writing the\naction in the form\nZ n\no\np\ne\n(10.2)\nA [q] =\n\u2212mc gik q\u0307 i q\u0307 k \u2212 \u03b1f (q) + Ai q\u0307 i d\u03c4,\nc\nwhere f is an external scalar field, and \u03b1 is a small parameter, which tends to zero\nat the end of calculations. At the properly chosen field f the expression under the\nradical can be positive even at gik q\u0307 i q\u0307 k < 0. It appeared that at the properly chosen\nfield f , the world line turned in time indeed. This turn is conserved at \u03b1 \u2192 0.\nThe direct calculations showed that at such a description the particle energy was\npositive always, but the time component p0 of the canonical momentum and the\nparticle charge Q = esgn(q\u0307 0 ) depended on sign of derivative q\u0307 0 , i.e. they were different for particle and antiparticle. It was rather sudden that theR WL charge Q,\ndefined as a source of the electromagnetic field by the relation Q = \u03b4A/\u03b4A0 (x)dx,\ndid not coincide with the constant e, incoming to the action, although at the correct description this was to be just so, because the particle and antiparticle had\nopposite sign of the charge. One can obtain coincidence of energy E and p0 , if one\ncuts the whole world line into segments, responsible for particles and antiparticles,\n3\n\ndesignations WL is used for the world line, considered as a fundamental object\n\n33\n\n\fand changes direction of the parameter \u03c4 increase on the segments, responsible for\nantiparticles, remaining \u03c4 without a change on segments, responsible for particles.\nAny change of the sign of q\u0307 0 is to be accompanied by a change of the sign of the\nconstant e. But the constant e is a parameter of the dynamic system, and a change\nof the sign of e on the segments, describing antiparticles means that particles and\nantiparticles are considered to be described in terms of different dynamic systems.\nThis simple example shows, that there are two possibilities of description\n(1) To consider the world line (WL) to be a physical object. Then particle and\nantiparticle are two different states of WL, distinguishing by signs of the charge Q\nand those of the canonical momentum component p0 . The energy is positive in both\ncases, so E 6= H, in general.\n(2) To consider the particle and the antiparticle to be different physical objects,\ndescribed by two different dynamic systems. The parameter e is the particle charge,\nwhich is simultaneously a parameter of the dynamic system. It is different for a\nparticle and for an antiparticle. At such a description the evolution parameter \u03c4\ncan be chosen in such a way, to provide fulfillment of the constraint E = H.\nImposition of the constraint E = H provided automatically fragmentation of\nthe world line into particles and antiparticles, describing them as different physical\nobjects, i.e. in terms of different dynamic systems. This was valid in classical\nphysics. This must be valid in the quantum theory.\nIt was unclear for me, what was a use of the identification of energy with Hamiltonian. Why does one cut WL to obtain indefinite nonconservative number of particles\nand antiparticles instead of fixed number of physical objects (WL)? From the formal\nviewpoint it is more convenient to work with constant number of object, than with\nalternating number of them. It was evident for me, that impossibility of working\nin QFT without the perturbation theory was connected directly with the fact that\nnumbers of particles and antiparticles were not conserved separately. What for does\none need to impose the condition E = H and to restrict one's capacity, if one could\nimpose no constraints? (Then I did not consider, that the condition E = H might\nappear to be incompatible with dynamic equations).\nIt was necessary to discuss the paper with colleagues dealing with QFT, and\nI submitted my report to seminar of the theoretical department of the Lebedev\nPhysical Institute, where there were many good theorists. At my report at the\nsession I was surprised by the following circumstance. Nobody believed that the\npair production effect could be described in terms of classical mechanics. Although\nmy calculations were very simple, they casted doubt on their validity. It was decided to transfer my report to next session. One of participants of the seminar\n(V.Ya. Fainberg) was asked to verify my calculations and to report on the next\nsession together with continuation of my report. Mistakes in my calculations were\nnot found, and I completed successfully my report on the next session. After the\nsession I seemed that the attention of participants of the seminar was attracted to\nthe problem of possibility of pair production description in terms of classical physics,\nwhereas the main problem, i.e. application the constraint E = H in QFT, remained\noutside the scope. Corresponding my paper was published [39], but, as far as know,\n34\n\n\fnobody payed any attention to it.\nIt was necessary to quantize nonlinear relativistic field without a use of the\ncondition E = H and to verify, if such a way of quantization had advantages over\nthe conventional way, using this condition. It happened that such a quantization\ncould be carried out without a use of normal ordering and perturbation theory [1].\nThe vacuum state appeared to be stationary. A possibility of quantization without\nthe perturbation theory impressed. But I shall not be cunning and say directly, that\nI had no illusions about results of my work. In that time (beginning of seventieths) I\nassumed that the problem of the quantum mechanics relativization (i.e. unification\nof quantum theory with the relativity theory) had no solution. I assumed that\nthe quantum mechanics was something like relativistic Brownian motion, and the\nrelativistic quantum theory should be developed in direction of statistical description\nof this relativistic motion [40].\nMy work on the secondary quantization of the nonlinear relativistic field was\nundertaken with the goal to manifest that the conventional way of the QFT development was a way to blind alley. The logic of my action was as follows. One\nquantizes the nonlinear field, using only principles of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and ignoring any additional suppositions. One advances as far as possible.\nThere were a hope that the quantization without the perturbation theory admitted\none to clarify real problems of QFT and, maybe, to solve some of them.\nThe fact was that the use of the perturbation theory did not permit one both\nto state exactly problems of QFT and to solve them. The problems of collisions\nwere the main problems of QFT. To state the collision problem, it was necessary\nto formulate exactly what was a particle and what was an antiparticle. According\nto quantum mechanics principles it is necessary for this to define the operator Npi\nof the 4-flux of particles and the operator Nai of the 4-flux of antiparticles. After\nsuch a definition one can state the problem of collisions. Surprisingly, it appeared\nthat nobody tried to introduce these operators. Instead of this there were cloudy\nconsideration about the interaction cut off at large time t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Thereafter these\nconsideration about cut off were substituted by manipulations with in- and outoperators, that did not clarify the statement of the collision problem.\nEven in the excellent mathematically rigorous book by F.A. Berezin [41] the\ncollision problem was stated in terms of perturbed H and nonperturbed H0 Hamiltonians of the system, that corresponds to interaction cut off at t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Of course,\nall this was only a reflection of the whole situation in QFT. I asked my colleagues\ndealing with QFT, how could one think in terms of the perturbation theory. They\nanswered obscurely. I understood, that some problems could not be solved exactly.\nI was ready to use any methods of approximation (including the perturbation theory) by the indispensable condition, that the problem be stated exactly, but not\nin approximate terms. To state a problem in approximate concepts and terms was\nbeyond my understanding.\nAs soon as the nonlinear field was quantized [1], results of my paper were reported on a session of the seminar of the theoretical department of Lebedev Physical\nInstitute. Although the secondary quantization was produced without the pertur35\n\n\fbation theory, most of participants considered my results to be unsatisfactory on\nthe ground that at the quantization one violated the condition\n[\u03c6 (x) , \u03c6\u2217 (x\u2032 )]\u2212 = 0,\n\n2\n\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) < 0\n\n(10.3)\n\nwhich was interpreted usually as the causality condition. Indeed, if at the quantization the condition E = H is not imposed, the commutator between the dynamic\nvariables at the points, separated by a spacelike interval x \u2212 x\u2032 cannot (and in some\ncases must not) vanish. Let me explain this in the example of pair production,\ndescribed in terms of classical physics, where the pair production is described by\ntime zigzag of the world line. In this case the commutator (10.3) associates with\nthe Poisson bracket. If the condition E = H is imposed and the quantization is\ncarried out in terms of particles and antiparticles, the dynamic variables X and X \u2032\nat the points, separated by a spacelike interval x \u2212 x\u2032 , relate to different dynamic\nsystems always. The corresponding Poisson bracket {X, X \u2032 } between any dynamic\nvariables X and X \u2032 at these points vanishes. In the case of quantization in terms of\nworld lines the dynamic variables X and X \u2032 at the points, separated by a spacelike\ninterval x \u2212 x\u2032 , can belong to the same world line, i.e. to the same dynamic system.\nThen the variables X and X \u2032 correspond to different values \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 of evolution\nparameter \u03c4 . In this case the dynamic variables X at the point x are expressed via\ndynamic variables X \u2032 at the point x\u2032 , and there exist such a dynamic variables X1\nat x and X2\u2032 at x\u2032 , that the Poison bracket {X1 , X2\u2032 } does not vanish. The condition\n(10.3) is violated with a necessity.\nThus, a fulfillment or a violation of the condition (10.3) is an attribute of a\ndescription. It coincides with the causality condition (i.e. with the objectively\nexisting relation) only at imposition of the condition E = H. Unfortunately, I\nfailed to convince my opponents of dependence the relation (10.3) on the way of\ndescription, although I tried to do this at the session and in discussions thereafter.\nLater on I had understood, that in this case one met associative delusion, when\nthe properties of description are attributed to the object in itself. Unfortunately,\nit happens that many researchers meet difficulties at overcoming of AD, and as\nI am understanding now, the P-style used by the most researchers of QFT is a\nreason of these difficulties. Besides, formulating the condition (10.3) in terms of\nquantum theory, it is very difficult to discover that this condition is an attribute of\na description, but not a causality condition.\nThus, I had overcame AD.7, but the scientific community as whole had not overcame it. I did not see a necessity in further convincing my colleagues to refuse from\nimposition of the condition E = H at quantization. At first, I was convinced that\nthe refusal itself from E = H did not solve main problems of QFT. My belief, that\nQFT did not enable to solve the unification problem of quantum theory with relativity and that the statement of this problem was false in itself, became stronger.\nSecondly, I myself did not know exactly what must replace this problem of unification. I had only a guess on this account. I might not to convince a person, dealing\nwith QFT and devoting essential part of his life to this, that he had chosen a wrong\nway. Without pointing a right way, such a convincing was useless and even cruel.\n36\n\n\fThere were once more an important circumstance which influenced strongly on\nmy interrelations with colleagues dealing with QFT. The fact is that, since I had\ndiscovered incorrectness of imposition the condition E = H, I met difficulties at\nreading papers on QFT. When I began to read any paper and discovered that the\ncondition E = H was used there (this was practically in all papers on QFT), my\nattention was cut off subconsciously, and I could not continue conscious reading.\nMy reading became absent-minded, and I needed to bend my every effort to turn\non my attention and continue a conscious reading. I do not know to what extent\nsuch a reaction is my individual property, but tearing off the papers using E = H\nled gradually to my allergy to reading of papers on QFT. I stopped to read them,\nalthough I was interesting QFT always, and questioned my colleagues about QFT\ndevelopment at any suitable case.\nWhy did I overcome associative delusions comparatively easy? Apparently, it\nwas connected with that I was an adherent of the C-style and ignored instinctively\napproaches, which were used by the P-style. It is difficult for me to say, whether\nthis adherence to the C-style was innate, or it was a result of my education. But\nsuch an adherence took place undoubtedly, and the following case justifies this.\nIn the beginning of seventieths I had a position of the scientific secretary of the\nSpace Research Institute. At this position I had a possibility to investigate all those\nproblems which I wanted, and I dealt with problems of quantum mechanics and\nQFT. Thereafter I left this position and passed to the position of a senior scientific\nresearcher in the department of G.I. Petrov, who was a director of the institute.\nThen I should deal with problems connected to some extent with space research.\nI had a possibility of choosing a field of investigations with one constraint. In the\ncourse of a half a year I was to study literature on the subject, chosen by me and read\na report on the seminar of G.I. Petrov to manifest my readiness for investigations\nin the new field.\nAny field of physics, connected with the space research, was new for me, and I\nhad chosen the problem of the pulsar magnetosphere model and investigation of the\npulsar mechanism. In seventieths it was a slightly developed and perspective field of\nastrophysics. The pulsar phenomenon was discovered recently (in 1967), and there\nwere the first considerations, concerning pulsar emanation formation. Studying the\nrecent literature on pulsars, I had read a report on the session of the seminar. Despite\nthe fact that I was a novice and amateur in this field, my report was very critical.\nIt was accompanied by a suggestion of my own investigation program.\nMy pretensions to the authors of reviewed papers were in that they invented\ndifferent hypotheses to avoid difficult calculations and attempted to guess a construction of the pulsar magnetosphere. In my opinion, they should to state the\nproblem of the pulsar magnetosphere and to solve it by means of well known methods of classical physics. I considered that hypotheses might be suggested either on\nthe first (heuristic) stage of investigations (but it was passed), or after all known\nmethods had been used already. The problem was in the scope of the classical\nphysics, and conceptual obstacles for its statement were absent. But most of authors did not want or was not able to state the problem correctly. Instead of this\n37\n\n\fthey advanced their hypotheses, attempting to explain the pulsar phenomenon at\nonce, and argued, whose hypothesis is better. In other words, they used the P-style\nat the condition, when it was not effective, and it was no necessity of using it.\nI did state simply the problem on the pulsar magnetosphere in such a way, as\nany researcher, using the C-style in his investigations, should do. I was working\naccording this program in the course of 1976 \u2013 1987. (see my concluding paper on\nthe pulsar model [42]). In that time I did not think on styles of investigations. I\nassumed simply, that one needed to investigate a physical phenomenon honestly,\nbut not to dodge, substituting calculations by conjectures. Maybe, my instinctive\nadherence to the C-style was so large, that penetrated to my subconsciousness and\ngenerated allergy to reading papers on QFT.\nMaybe, me successes in overcoming of different ADs was conditioned by consecutive application of C-style, essence of which could be expressed by the Newton's\nwords: \"I do not invent hypotheses\".\n\n11\n\nCan a curve be a fundamental object\nof geometry? Evidence of participant\non completion of the AD.4 overcoming\n\nMy work with technique, based on the world function, showed, that such a description of geometry was insensitive to topological properties of the space. For instance,\nthe metric tensor was the same for the Euclidean plane and for the cylinder, obtained from a band of this plane as a result of gluing its edges. But the world\nfunctions were different. This showed that the world function describes both local\nand global properties of geometry. Further I had discovered, that if all points of the\nspace except for points with integer value of coordinates removed, the remaining\npoints formed a discrete geometry, which could be described in terms of the world\nfunction.\nI understood also, that the world function contained complete information on\ngeometry. In particular, in the case of the Euclidean space I could obtain information\non the space dimension and construct the Cartesian coordinate system in the space,\neven in the case, when the space was an abstract set of points (but not a manifold).\nAt such a construction one used a concept of the straight segment between points\nP and P \u2032 , defined as set of points R, satisfying the equation\nS (P, R) + S (R, P \u2032 ) = S (P, P \u2032)\n\n(11.1)\n\nwhere S(P, P \u2032) denotes a distance between the points P and P \u2032 . I understood, that\nthe world function of the Euclidean space possessed special extremal properties. It is\nthese extremal properties that the equation (11.1) describes a one-dimensional line\neven in n-dimensional space, although at an arbitrary function S(P, P \u2032) the equation\n(11.1) describes, in general a (n \u2212 1)-dimensional surface. However, then I did not\n38\n\n\funderstood, how important was this definition, where segment of the straight was\ndefined without a reference to the concept of a curve.\nIn my representation of that time the world function was a result of integration\nof some expression, determined by the metric tensor. This integration provided a\nconnection between different points of the space. This connection was conserved,\neven if the most of space points were removed.\nThe property of the world function to provide a connection between points and\nits extremal properties seemed to me important. Realization of this fact took place\nin the middle of sixtieths. I wanted to write a paper about this properties, but it\nwas not clear, where I could to publish such a paper. The fact is that this result in\nitself without applications seemed to me insufficiently important for its publication.\nOpportunity for publication appeared only in the end of eightieths. I succeeded\nto publish two my articles, having no relation to geometry [43, 27], in Journal of\nMathematical Physics. At the publication of these articles I was pleasantly surprised\nby the kind relation of editors. Then I got an idea of publishing a paper on extremal\nproperties of world function which reflected my increasing understanding of the\nworld function role in geometry.\nThe paper was entitled \"Extremal properties of Synge's world function and discrete geometry.\" It was accepted to publication, but I was asked, first, to add\nreferences to contemporary papers and, second, to replace designation \"G\", which\nwas used for the world function, by conventional designation \u03c3. Addition of reference\nto more recent papers did not change the paper practically. The world function was\napplied in papers on quantization of gravitation, where \"long-range properties\" of\nthe world function were important. But nothing except for expansion over degrees\nof x \u2212 x\u2032 was used in these papers.\nBut the formal replacement of designation G by another designation \u03c3 led suddenly to essential revision of the paper. The fact is that there were practically no\npersonal computers in USSR, and my paper was written by means of typewriter.\nTo change designations I was forced to rewrite the whole paper. As far as the paper\nshould be retyped, I decided to include all corrections and additions which appeared\nin the time, when the paper was reviewed. In the course of revision I realized the\nimportance of the definition (11.1) of the straight segment and revised the character\nof presentation. Essentially a paper on a construction of a new geometry appeared,\nalthough the term T-geometry was not used in the paper. I began to think about\na change of the title, because the title of the paper did not reflect its content. The\ntitle should be changed.\nIn that time (1989) it was not simple. To submit a paper in a foreign journal one\nneeded a permission of \"Glavlit\", where the title of the paper was mentioned. To\nobtain a permission for forwarding a manuscript with other title, it was necessary\nto translate the new version to Russian and submit to \"Glavlit\". The procedure of\nobtaining a new permission would need one-two months. Besides the paper was to\nbe translated to Russian and typed. To avoid lack of time, I decided not to change\nthe title. The paper was printed with the previous title [8].\nAt the transition from the Riemannian geometry to T-geometry it was very\n39\n\n\fimportant to overcome inertia of thinking and realize, that a tube could play a role\nof the straight. Apparently, physical models of elementary particles helped me in\novercoming of the inertia of thinking. In some models the particle was substituted\nby a string or by a membrane, and their world tubes were respectively two- and\nthree-dimensional surfaces. It meant that in the real world a tube could play a\nrole of a straight. Psychologically it was a very important step in construction of\nT-geometry. Another important circumstance was the fact that the straight (i.e.\na natural geometrical object, determined by two different points) was defined as a\nset of points determined by the metrical property (11.1), i.e. without a reference\nto the concept of a curve. In Riemannian geometry the geodesic is defined as the\nshortest curve. At such a definition of geodesic, it cannot be a tube, and a use of\nthe concept of a curve at the geometry construction discriminates nondegenerate\ngeometries, i.e. geometries, where a tube plays a role of a straight. Note that the\npaper [8] had a transient character in the sense, that it described rather a transit\nfrom the Riemannian geometry to T-geometry, than the T-geometry as such.\nThe T-geometry appeared at first as a generalization of the Riemannian geometry\nand was applied as a possible space-time geometry [11]. Advantages of the spacetime model based on T-geometry were evident. First, it appeared that the geometry\ndepended only on interval between events and was insensitive to the space-time\ncontinuity, which cannot be tested. Second, in such a geometry the particle mass was\ngeometrized, that was impossible in the Minkowski geometry. Finally, the stochastic\nparticle motion, depending on the particle mass (i.e. on geometry), appeared in a\nnatural way. All this testified that T-geometry was suitable for the space-time\ndescription.\nThe two-metric technique, developed for the Riemannian space worked very well\nin T-geometry, admitting to investigate it in the small [20]. But from the practical\nviewpoint it was unessential, because the behavior of world lines of particles with\na finite mass depended on behavior of the world function at finite (but not at\ninfinitesimal) intervals.\nAlthough together with construction of T-geometry AD.4 was overcame in reality, realization of this fact was absent. At first, the T-geometry was derived as a generalization of Riemannian geometry, and the Riemannian geometry was considered\nto be a special case of T-geometry. In particular, in the paper [8] one investigated\nthe question, what world function must be, for degeneration of world tubes into\none-dimensional curves would take place and one could construct a manifold.\nAt first, I assumed that if the world function was given on a manifold and\nsatisfied differential equations, which should be satisfied by the world function of\na Riemannian space, then the T-geometry constructed on the base of this world\nfunction be a Riemannian geometry. In reality it was not so, because the role of\nthe concept of a curve at the construction of the Riemannian geometry was not\nexhausted by a construction of geodesics. In the Riemannian geometry the parallel\ntransport of a vector is founded also on the concept of a curve.\nMy interest to geometry was always of an applied character. I interested in\ngeometry as a method of description of the space-time properties. I did not thought\n40\n\n\fon a geometry as such, it was for me only a tool, and I troubled only with efficiency of\nthis tool. In accord with my style of investigations I did not read papers on geometry,\nand I troubled only one question whether I rediscovered any known results. Before\npublication of the paper [8] I had consulted by a well known mathematician, who\nsaid that nobody in USSR dealt with problems close to problems of T-geometry.\nAfter publication of the paper I took several attempts to discuss T-geometry with\nmathematicians. The mathematicians, interested in geometry in a large, discussed\nreadily problems of T-geometry, and I had read several successful reports on Tgeometry. As an \"inventor\" of T-geometry I was very glad, that the T-geometry\nwas not built before, and I became gradually to understand, what was a reason\nof this circumstance. AD.4, i.e. belief of mathematicians that the curve was a\nfundamental object of geometry, was a reason of impossibility of the T-geometry\nconstruction.\nMy reports on seminars of mathematicians were very valuable for me. Firstly,\nI had reduced my geometrical ignorance. Secondly, I became gradually to understand, that T-geometry was rather a generalization of metric geometry, than that of\nRiemannian. I discovered that in contemporary mathematics the geometries did not\nclassified practically, or such a classification was produced over accidental features.\nMoreover, there were a lack of coordination even in the definition, what is the geometry. For instance, well known mathematician Felix Klein [18] defined a geometry as\na conception, containing some symmetry group. The Riemannian geometry did not\nfall definitely under Klein's definition. According to Klein the Riemannian geometry\nshould be called the Riemannian topography (or geography). A.D. Alexandrov [44]\nused another definition of geometry.\nThe problem of classification is one of the most important problems in any science, and in mathematics especially. But I did not interested in this problem,\nbecause of my applied approach to geometry. I met this problem at the following\ncircumstances. On one hand, T-geometry was a very general geometrical construction, founded only on the world function. Topological properties appeared to be\nderivative ones with respect to metric properties of geometry. From viewpoint of\nT-geometry one cannot set topological properties of the space independently. On\nthe other hand, in the generalized Riemannian geometry [45, 46, 47] the topological\nproperties are introduced at first, and thereafter one introduces metrical properties,\nwhat one cannot make from the viewpoint of T-geometry. In general, as far as I\ncould understand, in present time the topology is considered to be the most promising direction of the geometry development. In support of this statement one can\nmention the following fact. In the faculty of mechanics and mathematics of Moscow\nLomonosov university there are three different chairs, whose titles contain words\n\"geometry\" and \"topology\" in different combinations.\nAs far as I saw a contradiction between the existence of T-geometry and the\ntopology as the most promising direction in geometry, the situation should be clarified in the process of discussions. My attempts to report T-geometry on seminars\nof the \"most geometrical\" chairs failed. Corresponding suggestions were declined\non the ground that such a report would not be interesting for researchers of these\n41\n\n\fchairs, who were interested in other problems. Then I prepared a report, entitled\n\"Geometry without topology\" and submitted it to Moscow Mathematical Society\n(MMS) with a request to hear it on one of sessions.\nMMS (a very respectable organization) heard on its sessions only very important\nreports (preliminary reviewed by experts). Review of my paper was negative. My\nwork on T-geometry was recognized by the reviewer as insufficiently fundamental\nand unworthy of hearing on a session of MMS. This was not quite that, what I\nneeded, because I needed a public discussion. Nevertheless, my goal was attained,\nalthough only by half. I obtained opinion of the expert, who was mostly competent\nin this problem. I had clarified from his review, that there are no classifications of\ngeometries in mathematics, and the problem of \"fundamental nature\" of geometry\nin question is determined entirely by opinion of a reviewer.\nMy argued appeal was not taken into account, but the other appeared to be\nimportant. It was important, that the negative review and reviewer's argumentation forced me to think about the problem of \"fundamental nature\" of a geometry.\nAs a result I came to a necessity of classification of geometries, and a key to the\nclassification was the concept of CG (conception of geometry) as a method of a construction of a standard (Euclidean) geometry. A criterion of generality of CG was\nthe amount of numerical information, which the given CG used for construction of\nthe standard geometry. Such a classification of CG is presented on p. 9. It follows\nfrom this classification that purely metric CG generates a class of the most general\ngeometries (T-geometries), whereas perspectives of topology-metric conception are\nunfavourable in this respect. The review was dated by the seventh November 2000.\nA result of my work over this review was a revision of my report, which turned\nto the article \"Geometry without topology as a new conception of geometry\" [48].\nThe paper was ready to the end of 2000th year. This paper was a corollary of my\ncomplete overcoming of AD.4.\nNow I am presenting chronology of my overcomings of AD.4 \u2013 AD.7 and trying\nto find the reasons, why I have succeeded to overcame these associative delusions.\nAD.5 \u2013 AD.7 were overcame practically in the same time in the beginning of seventieths of XX century. This overcoming was a corollary of my understanding of the\nsimple statement, that in the relativistic physics the physical object is WL (world\nline), but not a particle. Overcoming of AD.5 and AD.7 followed directly from this\ncircumstance. Overcoming of AD.6 was a simple corollary of the fact, that the quantum mechanics is a statistical description of stochastic relativistic particles motion.\nThus, finally, overcoming of AD.5 \u2013 AD.7 was a corollary of my understanding of\nthe relativity theory. Overcoming of AD.4 was happening in the course of a long\ntime. It was finished in the end of eightieths of XX century. Then it appeared in\nthe form of a guess. This overcoming in the form of a logical corollary happened\nin the end of 2000 year, when the conception of geometry was introduced and the\ntable, presented on p. 9 was obtained..\nWhat is a reason of these overcoming? What properties did I have and did not\nhave other researchers? I believe that these properties were as follows:\n(1) My understanding of the relativity theory. I thought in terms of space-time\n42\n\n\fdiagrams, i.e. geometrically, but not in terms of relativistic invariance as most of\nresearchers. I am connecting such a way of thinking with that, I had studied the\nrelativity theory on the book of V.A. Fock [25].\n(2) In my investigations I used the C-style and was consecutive in my research. The\nlogical consistence of a theory was more important for me, than its practical results.\n(3) In all time of my investigation activity I had not in reality any scientific divisor,\ni.e. there were no sufficiently authoritative for me person, who would say me, that\nI should use the more pragmatic P-style instead of C-style, that I used.\n(4) I was sufficiently self-reliant, to follow the way, that I was led by the logic. I did\nnot pay attention to other researchers, ignored all authorities and the circumstance,\nso that some researchers considered me as a scientific dissident.\nI present the peculiarities, which seems for me to be necessary for overcoming of\nassociative delusions. Each of this peculiarities appears rather rare. Collection of\nall these peculiarities at one person is the more rarity.\nTo describe my research activity briefly, one should say, that using C-style, I\nput consecutively into effect the idea of geometrization of physics, and this agreed\ncompletely with the general line of the physics development in XIX \u2013 XX centuries.\n\n12\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThus, the associative delusions (AD) accompanied the cognition process. Although\none should tend to eliminate ADs, but, apparently, the complete elimination of\nthem is impossible. In the case of impossibility of this elimination of ADs, AD\nleads to appearance of additional compensating hypotheses and to a construction\nof compensating (Ptolemaic) conceptions. Appearance of Ptolemaic conceptions\nleads to a generation of a special P-style of investigations, suitable for work with\nPtolemaic conceptions. The P-style is simultaneously a style of investigations and\na style of thinking. On one hand, the P-style is \"noise-resistant\" (suitable for work\nwith Ptolemaic constructions, containing false suppositions), but on the other hand,\nit is less predictable, than C-style. In the course of some time one can pursue\ninvestigations, using P-style. But, thereafter the Ptolemaic conceptions stops to be\neffective. It becomes necessary to find and to overcome corresponding AD, returning\nto C-style. If the P-style was existing for a long time and several generations of\nresearchers had educated on its application, the overcoming of AD and returning to\nthe C-style will be a difficult process. One needs to be ready to this.\nAfter discovering AD the subsequent revision of existing theory may appear to be\nvery essential. If it concerns the space-time geometry, the revision may lead even to\na change of a world outlook. Transition from the space-time with the primordially\ndeterministic particle motion to the space-time with the primordially stochastic\nmotion is already a ground for a change of the world outlook. If earlier it was\nnecessary to explain the stochasticity, starting from the determinism of the world,\nthen now one should explain deterministic phenomena on the basis of primordial\nstochasticity of the world.\n43\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Yu.
