The geometry of knotted solitons was studied to show\nthat the total linking numbers during the soliton interactions are preserved [1], and the anomaly structure of the\nfermions in a knotted soliton background was shown to be related to the inherent chiral properties of the soliton [4].\nMoreover, the curvature and torsion of a bosonic string in 3+1 dimensions were investigated [7] to be employed as\nHamiltonian variables in a two dimensional Ginzburg-Landau gauge field theory [8]. Interactions of vortices were\nalso investigated [9, 10] in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. In two and three dimensions, cross over from weak- to\nstrong-coupling superconductivities was studied to figure out their thermodynamics [11]. Quite recently, the SU(2)\nYang-Mills theory was studied to investigate a symmetry between electric and magnetic variables [12] and also to\ndiscuss the two-band superconductors with interband Josephson couplings [13, 14, 15, 16]. On the other hand, many\nexperiments and ab initio calculations show two-band superconductivity in MgB2 , for instance as in Refs. [17, 18].\nThe photoemission spectroscopy of superconductor NbSe2 indicates also the two-band superconductivity associated\nwith Fermi surface sheet-dependent superconductivity in this multi-band system [19]. Aslo theoretical studies indicate\na possibility of two-gap superconductivity without intrinsic Josephson effect in liquid metallic hydrogen, deuterium\nand hydrogen alloys under extreme pressures [20]-[23].\nIn this paper we will investigate the two-gap superconductors by exploiting the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory,\nwhere we study the magnetic flux quantization of two-gap superconductors. We will explicitly evaluate the London\npenetration depth and the Meissner and Josephson effects to obtain the nontrivial topological aspects of the two-gap\nsuperconductors. The knotted geometry will be also discussed in the framework of the bosonic strings.\nII.\n\nMODEL FOR TWO-GAP SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\nNow, in order to describe the two-band superconductors with the interband Josephson coupling [13, 14, 15, 16], we\nstart with the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory whose free energy density is given by\nF =\n\n1\n2m1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n2e ~\nh\u0304\n\u03a81\n\u2207+ A\ni\nc\n\n2\n\n+\n\n1\n2m2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n2e ~\nh\u0304\n\u03a82\n\u2207\u2212 A\ni\nc\n\n2\n\n+\n\n1 ~2\nB + V + \u03b7(\u03a8\u22171 \u03a82 + \u03a8\u22172 \u03a81 ),\n8\u03c0\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03a81 and \u03a82 are order parameters for Cooper pairs of two different flavors, V is the potential of the form\nV (|\u03a81,2 |2 ) = \u2212b\u03b1 |\u03a8\u03b1 |2 + 12 c\u03b1 |\u03a8\u03b1 |4 , (\u03b1 = 1, 2) [2, 14]. Here we introduce \u03b7 which is a characteristic of the interband\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: soonhong@ewha.ac.kr\naddress: niemi@teorfys.uu.se\n\n\f2\nJosephson coupling strength [13, 14, 15, 16]. In the case of \u03b7 = 0 vanishing Josephson coupling, we can describe the\nliquid metalic hydrogen which should allow coexistent superconductivity of protonic and electronic cooper pairs [20,\n21, 22, 23]. Moreover, the interband Josephson coupling merely changes the energy of the knot associated with the\ntwo-band superconductors. The two condensates are then characterized by different effective masses m\u03b1 , coherence\nlengths \u03be\u03b1 = h\u0304/(2m\u03b1 b\u03b1 )1/2 and densities h|\u03a8\u03b1 |2 i = b\u03b1 /c\u03b1 .\nWe then introduce fields \u03c1 and z\u03b1 defined as\n\u03a8\u03b1 = (2m\u03b1 )1/2 \u03c1z\u03b1\nwhere the modulus field \u03c1 is given by condensate densities and masses, \u03c12 =\ncomplex fields z\u03b1 are chosen to satisfy the geometrical constraint\n\n(2.2)\n1\n2\n2m1 |\u03a81 |\n\n+\n\n1\n2\n2m2 |\u03a82 | ,\n\nand the CP 1\n\nz\u03b1\u2217 z\u03b1 = |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 = 1.\nIn the two-gap superconductors, the gauge invariant supercurrent is given by [2]\n\u0012\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0015\ne\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\n2e ~\n2e ~\n\u2217\n~\nJ = \u2212\n\u03a81\n\u2207 + A \u03a81 \u2212 \u03a81\n\u2207 \u2212 A \u03a8\u22171\n2m1\ni\nc\ni\nc\n\u0012\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0015\nh\u0304\n2e ~\n2e ~\nh\u0304\ne\n\u2217\n\u03a82\n\u2207 \u2212 A \u03a82 \u2212 \u03a82\n\u2207 + A \u03a8\u22172 ,\n+\n2m2\ni\nc\ni\nc\nwhich can be rewritten in terms of the fields \u03c1 and z\u03b1 as follows,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~ + 4e A\n~ ,\nJ~ = \u2212h\u0304e\u03c12 C\nh\u0304c\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere\n~ = i(\u2207z \u2020 z \u2212 z \u2020 \u2207z) = i(z1 \u2207z1\u2217 \u2212 z1\u2217 \u2207z1 \u2212 z2 \u2207z2\u2217 + z2\u2217 \u2207z2 ),\nC\n\n(2.6)\n\nwith z = (z1 , z2\u2217 ).\nSince the CP 1 model is equivalent to the O(3) nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) [24] at the canonical level, one can\nintroduce the dynamical physical fields na (a = 1, 2, 3) which are mappings from the space-time manifold (or the\ndirect product of a compact two-dimensional Riemann surface M2 and the time dimension R1 ) to the two-sphere S 2 ,\nnamely na : M2 \u2297 R1 \u2192 S 2 . On the other hand, the dynamical physical fields of the CP 1 model are z\u03b1 which map\nthe spacetime manifold M2 \u2297 R1 into S 3 , namely z\u03b1 : M2 \u2297 R1 \u2192 S 3 . Since S 3 is homeomorphic to SU(2) group\nmanifold and the CP 1 model is invariant under a local U(1) gauge symmetry\nz \u2192 ei\u03be/2 z,\n\n(2.7)\n\nfor arbitrary space time dependent \u03be [25], the physical configuration space of the CP 1 model is that of the gauge\norbits which form the coset S 3 /S 1 = S 2 = CP 1 . In order to associate the physical fields of the CP 1 model with those\nof the O(3) NLSM, we exploit the projection from S 3 to S 2 , namely the Hopf bundle [25, 26]\nna = z \u2020 \u03c3a z,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwith the Pauli matrices \u03c3a and the na fields satisfying the geometrical constraint na na = 1, to yield the free energy\n1\n1 ~2\n1\nF = h\u03042 (\u2207\u03c1)2 + h\u03042 \u03c12 (\u2207na )2 + 2 2 J~2 +\nB + V + K\u03c12 n1 ,\n4\n4e \u03c1\n8\u03c0\n~ in terms of the supercurrent J~ in (2.4),\nwhere K = 2\u03b7(m1 m2 )1/2 .

Note that the two-gap surface supercurrents\nscreen out the applied field to yield the two-gap Meissner effect.

We consider a two-gap superconductor in the shape of a cylinder-like\nring where there exists a cavity inside the inner radius. In order to evaluate the magnetic flux inside the two-gap\nsuperconductor, we embed within the interior of the superconducting material a contour encircling the cavity. Since\nat low temperature T < Tc appreciable supercurrents can flow only near the surface of the superconductor and the\norder parameter magnitude \u03c1 vary only very slightly over the two-gapH superconductor, integration of the supercurrent\nJ~ in (2.5) over a contour vanishes to arrive at the magnetic flux \u03a6 = A carried by vortex of the superconductor. On\nthe other hand, to explicitly evaluate the phase effects of the two-gap superconductor, we parameterize the z\u03b1 fields\nas follows\n\u03b8\nz1 = |z1 |ei\u03c61 = ei\u03c61 cos ,\n2\n\nz2 = |z2 |ei\u03c62 = ei\u03c62 sin\n\n\u03b8\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nto satisfy the constraint (2.3). After some algebra, we obtain\n~ = 2(|z1 |2 \u2207\u03c61 \u2212 |z2 |2 \u2207\u03c62 ).\nC\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere note that even though there exists \u2207\u03b8 dependence of z\u03b1 \u2207z\u03b1\u2217 \u2212 z\u03b1\u2217 \u2207z\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2) in the each flavor channels, these\n~ cancel each other to yield vanishing overall effects. Since the order parameters \u03a8\u03b1 are single-valued\ncontributions to C\nin each\nflavor\nchannels,\ntheir corresponding phases should vary 2\u03c0 times integers p\u03b1 when the ring is encircled, to\nH\nyield \u2207\u03c6\u03b1 * d~l = 2\u03c0p\u03b1 so that we can obtain\nI\nC = 4\u03c0(|z1 |2 p1 \u2212 |z2 |2 p2 ).\n(4.3)\nExploiting (4.3), we arrive at\n|\u03a6| = (|z1 |2 p1 \u2212 |z2 |2 p2 )\u03a60 ,\nwhich is also written in terms of the na fields to yield the fractional magnetic flux quantized with vortex of the two-gap\nsuperconductors\n|\u03a6| =\n\n1\n(p1 \u2212 p2 + (p1 + p2 )n3 ) \u03a60 ,\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\n\f5\n\u22127\nwith the fluxoid \u03a60 = hc\ngauss-cm2 . Here note that the interband Josepson coupling does not change\n2e = 2.0679 \u00d7 10\nflux quantization since its role converts circularly symmetric vortex to a two-dimensional sin-Gordon vortex [14, 15].\nTo investigate a physical meaning of the magnetic flux (4.4) for the two-gap superconductor, we consider a particular\ncase of p1 = p2 = 1. In this case, we can find the magnetic flux carried by the vortex in terms of the angle \u03b8\n\n|\u03a6| = n3 \u03a60 = \u03a60 cos \u03b8,\nwhich shows that such a vortex can possess an arbitrary fraction of magnetic flux quantum since |\u03a6| depends on\nthe parameter cos \u03b8 measuring the relative densities of the two condensates in the superconductor as shown in (4.1).\nMoreover, in the case of p1 = \u2212p2 , the magnetic flux (4.4) is reduced to the well-known single-gap magnetic flux\nquantization, |\u03a6| = p1 \u03a60 , where we can readily find \u03b8 = 0 to yield |z1 | = 1 and |z2 | = 0. Note that, exploiting the\n2\nh\u0304e\n~\nabove identity (4.2), \u2207 \u00d7 J~ in (3.6) can be also rewritten in terms of the phase \u03c61 as: \u2207 \u00d7 J~ = \u2212 emn11s\nc B \u2212 2m1 \u2207n1s \u00d7\n2\n~ where we have the explicit phase dependent term.\n\u2207\u03c61 \u2212 e \u2207n1s \u00d7 A,\nm1 c\n\nV.\n\nKNOTTED STRING GEOMETRY\n\nNow, we consider bosonic string knot geometry associated with the two-gap superconductors. It is shown an\nequivalence between the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory and a version of the O(3) NLSM introduced in Ref. [31].\nMoreover, the model in Ref. [31] describes topological excitations in the form of stable, finite length knotted closed\nvortices [32] to lead to an effective string theory [33]. This equivalence can thus imply that the two-gap superconductors\nsimilarly support topologically nontrivial, knotted solitons.\nIn order to investigate the stringy features of the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory, we recall that in the Hopf\nbundle (2.8), na remains invariant under the U(1) gauge transformation (2.7). Exploiting the parameterization (4.1),\nna can be rewritten in terms of the angles \u03b8 and \u03b2 = \u03c61 + \u03c62 ,\n~n = (cos \u03b2 sin \u03b8, \u2212 sin \u03b2 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8).\n\n(5.1)\n\nNote that na is independent of the angle \u03b1 = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 so that \u03b1 can be considered as a coordinate generalization\nof parameter s of the string coordinates ~x(s) \u2208 R3 , which describe the knot structure involved in our two-gap\nsuperconductor. In fact, the knot theory in the two-gap superconductor can be constructed in terms of a bundle of\ntwo strings. Moreover, the U(1) gauge transformation (2.7) is related with the angle \u03b1 in such a way that\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03be,\n\n(5.2)\n\nto yield reparameterization invariance s \u2192 s\u0303(s).\nIn order to evaluate the Hopf invariant associated with the knot structure of the two-gap superconductor, we\nsubstitute (4.1) into (2.6) to obtain\nC = cos \u03b8d\u03b2 + d\u03b1,\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhich is also attainable from (4.2). Note that C in (5.3) transforms under (2.7) as\nC \u2192 cos \u03b8d\u03b2 + d(\u03b1 + \u03be),\n\n(5.4)\n\nso that C can be identified as the U(1) gauge field and its exterior derivative produces the pull-back of the area\ntwo-form on the two-sphere S 2 ,\n1\nH = dC = ~n * d~n \u2227 d~n = sin \u03b8d\u03b2 \u2227 d\u03b8,\n2\nand the corresponding dual one-form Gi = 12 \u01ebijk Hjk , which can be rewritten in terms of the angles \u03b8 and \u03b2:\nG=\n\n1\nsin \u03b8d\u03b2 \u2227 d\u03b8.\n2\n\nThe Hopf invariant QH is then given by\nQH =\n\n1\n8\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nH \u2227C =\n\n1\n8\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nsin \u03b8d\u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b2 \u2227 d\u03b8.\n\n\f6\nNote that if there exists a nonvanishing Hopf invariant, the bundle of two strings forms a knot so that the flat\nconnection d\u03b1 cannot be removed through the gauge transformation (5.4).\nNext, to figure out the knot structure more geometrically we employ a right-handed orthonormal basis defined by\na triplet (~n, ~e1 , ~e2 ) where ~n is given by (5.1) and\n~e1 = (cos \u03b2 cos \u03b8, \u2212 sin \u03b2 cos \u03b8, \u2212 sin \u03b8),\n\n~e2 = (sin \u03b2, cos \u03b2, 0).\n\nUsing this orthonormal basis, we define with ~e\u00b1 = ~e2 \u00b1 i~e1 a curvature and a torsion:\n1\n1 \u00b1\u03b1\ne ~e\u00b1 * \u2202i~n = e\u00b1\u03b1 (\u2212 sin \u03b8\u2202i \u03b2 \u00b1 i\u2202i \u03b8),\n2\n2\ni\n\u03c4i = ~e\u2212 * (\u2202i + i\u2202i \u03b1)~e+ = cos \u03b8\u2202i \u03b2 \u2212 \u2202i \u03b1.\n2\n\n\u03ba\u00b1\ni =\n\nHere one can readily check that the curvature \u03ba\u00b1\ni and the torsion \u03c4i are invariant under the U(1)\u00d7U(1) gauge\ntransformations defined by (2.7) and (5.2) and also they are not independent to yield flatness relations between them,\nd\u03c4 + 2i\u03ba+ \u2227 \u03ba\u2212 = 0,\n\nd\u03ba\u00b1 \u00b1 i\u03c4 \u2227 \u03ba\u00b1 = 0.\n\nHere we emphasize that the knotted stringy structures of the two-gap superconductors are constructed only in terms\nof the CP 1 complex fields z\u03b1 in the order parameters \u03a8\u03b1 in (2.2), since the modulus field \u03c1 associated with the\ncondensate densities does not play a central role in the geometrical arguments involved in the topological knots of the\nsystem.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied the current equations in two-gap superconductor to yield the nontrivial topological aspects and\ndiscussed its relationship to Meissner effects. We have also discussed the knotted string geometry in terms of the Hopf\ninvariant, curvature and torsion of the strings associated with U(1)\u00d7U(1) gauge group.\nThe work of AJN is supported by grant VR-2003-3466.
