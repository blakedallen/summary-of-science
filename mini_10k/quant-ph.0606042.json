A quantum analogy of the transfer function determines the\nspace where the reconstruction should be done without the need for any ad hoc truncations of the\nHilbert space. An illustration of this method is provided by a simple yet practically important\ntomography of an optical signal registered by realistic binary detectors.\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Wj, 42.50.Lc\n\nThe development of effective and robust methods of\nquantum state reconstruction is a task of crucial importance for quantum optics and information. Such methods are needed for quantum diagnostics: for the verification of quantum state preparation, for the analysis\nof quantum dynamics and decoherence, and for information retrieval. Since the original proposal for quantum\ntomography and its experimental verification [1, 2] this\ndiscipline has recorded significant progress and is considered as a routine experimental technique nowadays.\nReconstruction has been successfully applied to probing\nthe structure of entangled states of light and ions, operations (quantum gates) with entangled states of light\nand ions or internal angular momentum structure of correlated beams, just to mention a few examples [3].\nAll these applications exhibit common features. Any\nsuccessful quantum tomography scheme relies on three\nkey ingredients: on the availability of a particular tomographically complete measurement, on a suitable representation of quantum states, and on an adequate mathematical algorithm for inverting the measured data. In addition, the entire reconstruction scheme must be robust\nwith respect to noise. In real experiments the presence\nof noise is unavoidable due to losses and due to the fact\nthat detectors are not ideal. The presence of losses poses\na limit on the accuracy of a reconstruction. However,\nthe very presence of losses can be turned into advantage\nand used for the reconstruction purposes. As has been\npredicted in Ref. [4], imperfect detectors, which are able\nto distinguish only between the presence and absence of\nsignal (binary detectors) provide sufficient data for the\nreconstruction of the quantum state of a light mode provided their quantum efficiencies are less than 100%. The\npresence of losses is thus a necessary condition for a successful reconstruction: An ideal binary detector would\nmeasure only the probability of finding the signal in the\nvacuum state.\nThe required robustness of a tomography scheme with\nrespect to noise is often difficult to meet especially if it is\nbiased, that is, if some aspects of the quantum systems\nin question are observed more efficiently than the others.\nSince our ability to design and control measurements is\nseverely limited, this situation will typically arise when\n\none wants to characterize a system with a large number or infinitely many degrees of freedom, for instance in\nthe quantum tomography of light mode mentioned above.\nThe standard approach is to truncate the Hilbert space\nby a certain cut-off, reducing drastically the number of\nparameters involved [5]. Needless to say, such ad hoc\ntruncation lacks physical foundation. It may have bad\nimpact on the accuracy of reconstruction or conversely it\nmay lead to more regular results. The latter case may\neasily happen when an experimentalist seeks for the result in the neighborhood of the true state. Such a tacitly\naccepted assumption may appear as crucial as it allows\nelimination of the infinite number of unwanted free parameters. This drawback erodes the notion of tomography as an objective scheme.\nIn this Letter we will propose a reconstruction procedure that is optimized with respect to the experimental\nset-up, representation and inversion, designed for dealing\nwith biased tomography schemes. The recommended approach to the generic problem of quantum state tomography will be demonstrated on the scheme of a light mode\nadopting elements of linear optics (beam splitter) with\nrealistic binary detectors detecting the presence or absence of the signal only. In addition, we will, for the first\ntime present a statistically correct description of such a\ntomographic scheme.\nLet us develop a generic formalism for the maximumlikelihood (ML) inversion of the measured data. Let us\nassume detections of a signal enumerated by the generic\nindex j. Their probabilities are predicted by Quantum theory by means of positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) elements Aj ,\npj = Tr[Aj \u03c1],\n\n0 \u2264 Aj \u2264 1,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c1 being the quantum state. The observations Aj are assumed to be tomographically complete in the Hilbert subspace we are interested in. No other specific assumptions\nabout the operators Aj , their commutation relations or\ngroup properties will be made. In general, probabilities\npj are not normalized to one as the operator sum\nX\nAj = G \u2265 0\n(2)\nj\n\n\f2\nmay differ from the identity operator. Theoretical probabilities pj can be sampled experimentally by means of\nregistered data Nj . The aim is to find the quantum state\n\u03c1 from data Nj .\nThe ML scenario hinges upon a likelihood functional\nassociated with the statistics of the experiment. In the\nfollowing, we will adopt the generic form of likelihood for\nun-normalized probabilities [6]\n#\n\"\nX\npj\n,\n(3)\nNj log P\nlog L =\nj \u2032 pj \u2032\nj\n\nwhich should be maximized with respect to \u03c1. Here\nthe index j runs over all registered data. The extremal\nequation for the maximum-likely state can be derived\nin three steps: (i) The positivity of \u03c1 is made explicit\nby decomposing it as \u03c1 = \u03c3 \u2020 \u03c3. (ii) Likelihood (3)\nis varied with respect to independent matrix \u03c3 using\n\u03b4(log pj )/\u03b4\u03c3 = Aj \u03c3 \u2020 /pj ; (iii) Obtained variation is set\nequal to zero and multiplied from right side by \u03c3 with\nthe result\nP\nX j \u2032 pj \u2032 N j\nP\nR\u03c1 = G\u03c1,\nR=\nAj ,\n(4)\nj \u2032 Nj \u2032 pj (\u03c1)\nj\n\nwhere the operator G is defined by Eq. (2) and operator\nR depends on the particular choice of L. Notice that\nthis equation may be cast in the form of ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm [7]\nRG \u03c1G = \u03c1G ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere RG = G\u22121/2 RG\u22121/2 and \u03c1G = G1/2 \u03c1G1/2 . This\nextremal equation may be solved by iterations in a fixed\northogonal basis. Keeping the positive semi-definiteness\nof \u03c1G [by combining Eq. (4) with its Hermitian conjugate]\nthe (n + 1)th iteration reads\n(n+1)\n\n\u03c1G\n\n(n) (n)\n\n(n)\n\n= RG \u03c1G RG ,\n\n(n)\n\nRG = G\u22121/2 R(\u03c1(n) )G\u22121/2 .\n(0)\n\nStarting with some initial guess \u03c1G the iterations are\nrepeated until the fixed point is reached. In terms of \u03c1G ,\nthe desired solution is then given by\n\u03c1 = G\u22121/2 \u03c1G G\u22121/2 .\n\n(6)\n\nGoing back to likelihood in Eq. (3) we now see, that\nthe operator G coming\nfrom the mutual normalization\nP\np\n=\nTr[\u03c1G], provides a complete\nof probabilities,\nj\nj\n(normalized) POVM, which is\nto the origiPequivalent\n\u22121/2\n\u22121/2\nnal biased observations Aj :\nG\nA\nG\n= 1G .\nj\nj\nThis establishes the preferred basis for a reconstruction.\nDue to the division by the operator G in Eq. (6) and in\nthe sentence above the reconstruction can be done only\nin the subspace spanned by the non-zero eigenvalues of\nG. The spectrum of G plays therefore the role of tomographic transfer function analogously to the transfer\nfunction in optical imaging. It quantifies the resolution\n\nof the reconstruction in the Hilbert space. Large eigenvalue of G indicates that many observations overlapped\nin the corresponding Hilbert subspace and this part of\nthe Hilbert space is more visible. The Hilbert subspace\nwhere the reconstruction was done is clearly not a subject\nof a free choice in the proper statistical analysis. This is\nthe main result of this Letter. This also gives a clue how\nto approximate the solution in the infinite dimensional\ncase simply by taking the subspace corresponding to the\ndominant eigenvalues. The result of reconstruction can\nbe easily checked in the preferred basis afterwards. If the\nreconstructed state exhibits dominant contributions for\nthe components with relatively small eigenvalues of G,\nthe result cannot be trusted.\nThe essence of the correct reconstruction inhere in the\nfollowing recommended scenario: After collecting all data\nthe optimal basis for reconstruction is identified as eigenvectors of G operator. The truncation is achieved by taking into account only those with dominant eigenvalues,\nwhere the ML extremal equation should be solved keeping the semi-positive definiteness of the density matrix.\nThis establishes the quantum tomography as an objective\ntool for the analysis of infinite dimensional quantum systems. Indeed, previously reported results of tomographic\nschemes have always considered the space for reconstruction ad hoc: If one knows what the result should be it is\nnot really difficult to get it.\nLet us illustrate this procedure on the following simple\nrealistic detection set-up: the signal state (described by\nthe density matrix \u03c1) of the input mode a is mixed on\na beam-splitter with the probe coherent state |\u03b2i of the\nmode b and the mixed field is detected on a single on/off\ndetector. Then the probability p of having no counts on\nthe detector is measured.\nSuch non-ideal measurements have already been used\nfor tomography purposes. The inference of a photon\nnumber distribution was proposed in [8] and experimentally realized in [9]. A more advanced setup based on a\nmultichannel fiber loop detector was developed and experimentally verified earlier in [10]. As proposed in [11]\nand [12], the reconstruction of a full density matrix can\nbe done by measuring a coherently shifted signal. This\nreconstruction technique has also been implemented experimentally as a direct counting of Wigner function [13].\nHowever, the algorithms used for the quantum state reconstruction were not robust as indicated by the fact that\nthey could give non-physical results. This is due to the\na priori constraints put on a quantum object, namely\nthe semi-positive definiteness of a density matrix \u03c1 \u2265 0,\nwhich is not guaranteed in the above mentioned schemes.\nWhile it seems to be intractable to implement the condition of positive semi-definiteness in Wigner representation, it can be done in the general formalism adopting\nthe maximum-likelihood estimation.\nThe probability of registering no counts on the detector\nis given by Mandel's formula [14]:\np = h: exp {\u2212\u03bdc c\u2020 c} :i,\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n50\n\n200\n\n40\n\nNp=64\n\n(b)\n\n100\n80\n\nNp=16\n\nRe(\u03c1mn)\n\n250\n\n60\n\n30\n\n100\n\n20\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03bbG\n\n\u03bbG\n\n150\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n15\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nm+1\n\n(d)\n\n50\nNp=4\n\n0.2\n\n0.06\n\u03c3mn\n\np\n\n30\n20\n\nIm(\u03c1mn)\n\n40\n\nN =4\n\n30\n\n0.04\n0.02\n\n20\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n0\n\n5\n\nn+1\n\n5\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n40\n\n\u03bbG\n\n4\n1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFIG. 1:\nEigenvalues of the matrix G (2) truncated at\nNtr = 15.

(1).\nFigure 1 shows how a suitable choice of \u03b3-points for a\nfixed truncation number Ntr = 15 can be achieved. Obviously, the amount of data used in Fig. 1(a) as compared\nto Fig. 1(b) is excessive for the reconstruction. On the\nother hand, when the number of points is too small, or\nthey are chosen in an inappropriate way, eigenvalues of G\ndiffer strongly making reconstruction unfeasible. For example, in Figure (d) the last eigenvalue is only \u223c 10\u22125 .\nHowever, one needs to mention that the analysis of G\nprovides a necessary but not sufficient condition of the\nreconstruction feasibility. In particular, a single \u03b3 point\nmeasurement is not sufficient (just like a measurement\n\nn+1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nm+1\n\n5\n\n2\n3\n4\nn+1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nm+1\n\nFIG. 2: A reconstruction of the state (10) according to\nprocedure (5). The following measurements were used:\nRe(\u03b3) = \u22120.2, \u22120.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2; Im(\u03b3) = 0.1, \u22120.5, 0, 0.5, 0.1;\n20 equidistantly distributed detector efficiencies in the interval [0.1, 0.9] were used; the Hilbert space was truncated at\nNtr = 5. Panel (a) shows the eigenvalues of the matrix G.\nPanels (b) and (d) show the real and imaginary parts of the\nreconstructed matrix (in Fock basis). They were obtained\nusing 106 iteration of the EM algorithm. Panel (c) shows\nthe variances of the real part (n \u2264 m) and imaginary part\n(n > m) of the reconstructed elements given by Eq. (9).\n\nin \u03b3 = 0 is able to give only the diagonal elements).\nOne needs to measure in at least two different non-zero\n\u03b3 points. The confidence interval on the reconstructed\ndensity matrix elements can be provided with help of\nvariance \u03c3(\u03c1mn ) = (F (\u03c1mn )Nmes )\u22121/2 , where Nmes is\nthe total number of measurements, and the Fisher information F can be defined for real part of the density\nmatrix elements as [17]:\n#2\n\"\nP\nX j \u2032 pj \u2032\npj\n\u2202\nP\nF (Re[\u03c1mn ]) =\n, (9)\npj\n\u2202Re(\u03c1mn ) j \u2032 pj \u2032\nj\n\nand similarly with Re changed to Im for imaginary part\nof \u03c1.\nTo illustrate our discussion, let us consider a reconstruction of the following state (Figure 2):\n\u221a\n(10)\n|\u03c6i = (|0i + exp{0.5i}|2i) / 2.\n\nThe simulation was done using a total of 107 measurements collected in five different points on the phase plane\n\u03b3. In Fig. 2(a) one can see the eigenvalues of the matrix\nG (2). Obviously, the chosen set of points is suitable for\nthe reconstruction. Notice the correlation between decreasing eigenvalues and increasing errors in Figs. 2(a)\nand (c).\nThis objective approach may compared with alternative schemes based on the reconstruction of Wigner function.

These\nmatrix elements can be found by inverting the counted\nstatistics (8) measured with a set of different efficiencies\nsolving a linear positive inverse problem. This can be\naccomplished by means of the EM algorithm similarly\nto the approach used in [16]. An example of such a reconstruction is shown in Fig. 3. Though the reconstruction seems to be faithful, one should keep in mind that\neven very small deviations from the true Wigner function might make it non-physical. Such Wigner function\nwould not correspond to any physical, positive definite\ndensity matrix. This is due to the fact that the operators\nRn,\u03b3 do not commute for different \u03b3s, so noisy measurements may give inconsistent results. Going back from\nWigner function to Rthe density matrix using Glauber's\nformula [18], \u03c1 = 2 d2 \u03b3(\u22121)n W (\u03b3 \u2217 , \u03b3)D(2\u03b3), one can\nsee in Fig. 3(b), that some diagonal elements of the reconstructed matrix are negative.\nA generic biased tomography scheme addressing some\naspects of the quantum systems more efficiently than\nother aspects was introduced. Its performance is characterized by quantum analogy of transfer function, which\nmay be further optimized to achieve the desired resolution. This establishes tomography as an objective tool for\nquantum diagnostics. The recommended approach was\ndemonstrated on a simple, robust and effective quantum\ntomography scheme using detectors that are only capable to distinguish between the presence and absence of\nphotons.\nThe authors acknowledge the support from Research\nProject MSM6198959213 of the Czech Ministry of Education, Grant No. 202/06/0307 of Czech Grant Agency, EU\nproject COVAQIAL FP6- 511004 (J.R. and Z.
