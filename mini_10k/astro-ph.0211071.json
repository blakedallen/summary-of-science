In order for\nthe reionization to end by z = 6, and assuming that the clumping factor of ionized gas during the reionization epoch is close to unity, this ionizing comoving\nemissivity cannot decline from z = 4 up to z \u223c 9 by more than a factor 1.5.\nIf the clumping factor were much larger than unity, then the emissivity would\nneed to rapidly increase with redshift.

This\nsuggests that the reionization of hydrogen was probably completed near the epoch z = 6.\nThis conclusion is not yet completely certain because an ionized medium can produce a\ncomplete Gunn-Peterson trough if the neutral fraction is everywhere high enough (owing to\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\na low intensity of the ionizing background). However, the abrupt change with redshift near\nz = 6 of the fraction of transmitted flux in the Ly\u03b1 region of the spectrum (Becker et al.\n2001) implies a rapid increase of the mean free path of ionizing photons with time (Fan et al.\n2002), at least in the region of the line of sight to the z = 6.28 QSO, just as expected when\nthe last low-density regions of the intergalactic medium are ionized (e.g., Gnedin 2000).\nEnding reionization by z = 6 requires that at least one ionizing photon has been emitted\nto the intergalactic medium for each baryon in the universe, in addition to the amount\nneeded to compensate for any recombinations that have taken place. This implies that the\nemissivity of ionizing photons (defined as the mean number of photons emitted per unit time\nand volume) should be greater than the mean number density of baryons divided by the age\nof the universe at z \u2243 6, unless the emissivity had declined rapidly with time at z > 6.\nIt is possible to infer the emissivity at lower redshift, by using the intensity of the\nionizing background measured from the mean transmitted flux in the Ly\u03b1 forest, and the\nmean free path of ionizing photons determined from the observed abundance of Lyman limit\nsystems. The first of these two quantities, the intensity of the ionizing background, can\nbe measured in the context of the present theoretical understanding of the Ly\u03b1 forest as\narising from a photoionized intergalactic medium that follows the gravitational evolution of\nprimordial fluctuations (see the review by Rauch 1998 and references therein). The observed\nmean transmitted flux can then be used to infer the Ly\u03b1 scattering optical depth at the\nmean hydrogen density and in Hubble expansion, \u03c4u :\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00131\n\u00139\n\u0012\n0.7 0.3 2 \u22120.7 \u22121 1 + z 2\n\u03a9b h2\n5 \u03a9b h(1 \u2212 Y ) H0\n\u03c4u = 4.65 * 10\nT4 \u0393\u221212\n. (1)\nxHI = 2.12\nH(z)\n0.02\nh \u03a9m\n5\nHere, xHI is the hydrogen neutral fraction at mean density, T4 is the gas temperature in\nunits of 104 K, and \u0393\u221212 is the photoionization rate due to the cosmic background in units\nof 10\u221212 s\u22121 . When the value of \u03a9b h2 was still highly uncertain, the value of \u03c4u inferred from\nobservations of the mean transmitted flux, \u03c4u \u2243 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 at z = 3 (see Rauch et al. 1997,\nand Table 2 in McDonald et al. 2000) implied a lower limit to the value of \u03a9b h2 given by the\nlower limit on \u0393\u221212 that was inferred from the observed QSOs. Now, \u03a9b h2 has been more\naccurately measured from the primordial deuterium abundance (O'Meara et al. 2001) and\nthe CMB spectrum of fluctuations (de Bernardis et al. 2002; Pryke et al. 2002; Spergel et\nal. 2003), and we can use the value of \u03c4u (z) determined from the Ly\u03b1 forest to constrain the\nintensity of the ionizing background and its evolution with redshift.\nThe mean free path of ionizing photons is related to the abundance of Lyman limit\nsystems, which have column densities NHI > 1.6 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 . The reason is that the column\ndensity distribution of absorption systems is approximately of the form f (NHI ) dNHI \u221d\n\u22121.5\nNHI\ndNHI (e.g., Petitjean et al. 1993), so the average rate of absorption is dominated by\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nhigh column densities, up to the column density at which the absorption systems become\noptically thick. The abundance of Lyman limit systems has been reasonably well measured\nup to redshift z = 4. In this paper, we combine the measurements of the intensity and the\nmean free path of ionizing photons to infer their rate of emission at z = 4 (\u00a72). We then\ncompare this emissivity to the observations of known sources at this redshift (\u00a73). Then, in\n\u00a74, we find the consequences for the evolution of the emissivity at higher redshift to satisfy\nthe requirement of reionizing the IGM by z = 6. Finally, in \u00a75 the consequences for the\nThomson optical depth of the Cosmic Microwave Background photons are discussed. We\nwill use the flat cosmological model with \u03a9m = 0.3, h = 0.65, and \u03a9b h2 = 0.022.\n\n2.\n\nThe ionizing emissivity at z = 4\n\nIn this section we evaluate the emissivity of ionizing radiation at redshift z = 4. In\nterms of the photoionization rate, \u0393, and the mean free path of the ionizing photons, \u03bbi , the\nphoton emissivity is given by \u01ebi = \u0393/(\u03bbi \u03c3\u0304), where \u03c3\u0304 is a frequency-averaged cross section.\nThe result we will find in this paper is that the emissivity at z = 4 has a rather small\nvalue, implying that it must not have declined much with redshift, up to a substantially\nearlier epoch at z > 6, in order to satisfy the requirement that reionization was completed\nby z \u2243 6. With that in mind, we will evaluate the maximum allowed value of \u0393 and of \u01ebi at\nz = 4, which is the highest redshift at which the mean free path \u03bbi has been observationally\ndetermined.\n\n2.1.\n\nThe photoionization rate\n\nThe most recent measurements of the mean transmitted flux through the Ly\u03b1 forest, F\u0304 ,\nwere reported by Bernardi et al. (2002), from a large sample of QSOs of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. From their Fig. 4, the effective optical depth [defined as F\u0304 \u2261 exp(\u2212\u03c4ef f )] at z = 4 is\n\u03c4ef f = 1.02 \u00b1 0.02, where we have estimated the error from the errorbars and scatter of their\nmeasured points at various redshift bins. Hence, F\u0304 < 0.37 at z = 4. Note that previous\nvalues of F\u0304 from a small sample of high resolution spectra (Schaye et al. 2000, McDonald\net al. 2000) were higher, but this was probably because their method underestimated the\nQSO continuum flux, which becomes increasingly difficult to set by fitting regions between\nabsorption lines as the redshift increases.\nWe now use the results of McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (2001, hereafter MM01) to infer\nthe photoinization rate \u0393\u221212 . According to their Figure 2, the value F\u0304 < 0.37 implies a\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nphotoionization rate of \u0393\u221212 < 0.40 at z = 4.5. This value needs to be corrected from the\nmodel used in MM01 to the model we use here, and to z = 4, where we will choose all the\nparameters to maximize \u0393\u221212 , and therefore infer an upper limit. First of all, the relationship\nbetween F\u0304 and \u03c4u in equation (1) depends on the amplitude of the mass power spectrum at\nthe Jeans scale of the Ly\u03b1 forest: a lower amplitude of fluctuations implies that the gas is\nless concentrated in collapsed regions that correspond to saturated absorption lines, and a\ngreater fraction of the gas is left in low-density regions, where it contributes more efficiently\nto decrease the mean transmitted flux. The measured amplitude of the power spectrum\nof the Ly\u03b1 forest (see Croft et al. 2002 and references therein) is 0.86 times lower than\nthe amplitude in the model that was used by MM01 (as shown in McDonald et al. 2000),\nwhich had the parameters \u03c38 = 0.79 and n = 0.95 for the power spectrum. In other words,\nthe model used by MM01 would match the Ly\u03b1 forest power spectrum amplitude found by\nCroft et al. if its normalization had been changed to \u03c38 = 0.86 * 0.79 = 0.68, leaving all other\nparameters unchanged. Since the amplitude of mass fluctuations grows proportionally to the\nscale factor a (the effects of the vacuum energy and the radiation are negligible at z = 4), the\nmodel with normalization \u03c38 = 0.68 has the same relation of F\u0304 and \u03c4u at z = 4 as the model\nwith normalization \u03c38 = 0.79 at z = (1 + 4)/0.86 \u2212 1 = 4.8. It was also found in MM01 that\nthe value of \u03c4u inferred from a fixed F\u0304 depends on the amplitude approximately as \u03c38\u22122 (this\ncan in fact be checked by comparing the values of \u0393\u221212 at z = 4.5 and z = 5.2 for fixed F\u0304 in\nFig. 2 of MM01). Because the limit \u0393\u221212 < 0.4 was derived at z = 4.5, and \u0393\u221212 \u221d \u03c4u\u22121 , the\npower spectrum amplitude correction is a factor (5.8/5.5)2. We note that here we have taken\nthe central measured value of Croft et al. of the power spectrum normalization, instead of\na lower value within their errorbar (which would further raise the upper limit to \u0393\u221212 by\nabout 20%), because other measurements of the power spectrum amplitude favor a higher\nvalue instead (see Seljak 2001; van Waerbeke et al. 2001; Croft et al. 2002; Jarvis et al. 2002;\nSpergel et al. 2003).\nSecond, the inferred \u0393\u221212 depends on the gas temperature. MM01 assumed T4 = 2,\nbut measurements of the gas temperature from the Ly\u03b1 forest spectra have given values in\nthe range 1.2 < T4 < 2 (Theuns et al. 2002 and references therein). Although the optical\ndepth of a uniform medium is proportional to T \u22120.7 (eq. 1) because of the temperature\ndependence of the recombination coefficient, the relation between F\u0304 and \u03c4u is also affected by\nthe temperature because thermal broadening spreads some of the absorption from saturated\nspectral regions to other regions with less absorption. We use the result found in McDonald\net al. (2001, their \u00a77.4) that thermal broadening causes a change in \u03c4u of 27% of that\ndue to the recombination coefficient, in the opposite direction, therefore giving an effective\ndependence \u0393\u221212 \u221d T \u22120.5 . If we assume the lowest value of the temperature among the\nreported measurements, T4 = 1.2, then the temperature correction for the upper limit of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\u0393\u221212 is (2/1.2)0.5 .\nFinally, we correct for all other parameters used in MM01 (\u03a9b h2 = 0.02, h = 0.65,\n\u03a9m = 0.4, z = 4.5) to the ones used here (\u03a9b h2 = 0.022, h = 0.65, \u03a9m = 0.3, z = 4), which\nwe choose within the current uncertainties to maximize the inferred \u0393\u221212 . The result of all\nthese corrections (see eq. 1) for the upper limit to \u0393\u221212 at z = 4 is\n\u0393\u221212 (z = 4) < 0.40\n\n\u0012\n\n5.8\n5.5\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n2.2.\n\n2\n1.2\n\n\u00130\n\n.5\n\n\u0012\n\n0.022\n0.02\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\u0013 12 \u0012\n\n5\n5.5\n\n\u00134.5\n\n= 0.53 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe mean free path\n\nStorrie-Lombardi et al. (1994) found that the rate of Lyman limit systems (defined as\nabsorption systems with column density NHI > 1.6\u00d71017 cm\u22122 ) at z = 4 is dNLL /dz = 3.3\u00b1\n0.6. In other words, the mean spacing between Lyman limit systems is \u03bbLL = cH \u22121 (z)/(1 +\nz)/(3.3 \u00b1 0.6) = (0.06 \u00b1 0.01)cH \u22121 (z) at z = 4. To find the relationship of \u03bbLL to the\nmean free path of ionizing photons, we assume that the column density distribution of the\n\u22121.5\nabsorbers is f (NHI ) dNHI \u221d NHI\ndNHI (Petitjean et al. 1993). The absorption probability\n\u22121\nper unit length, \u03bb0 , for a photon at the hydrogen ionization edge frequency \u03bd = \u03bdHI , is\nR\u221e\n\u221a\nd\u03c4 \u03c4 \u22121.5 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )\n\u03c0\n1\n0 R\n=\n,\n(3)\n=\n\u221e\n\u22121.5\n\u03bb0\n\u03bbLL\nd\u03c4 \u03c4\n\u03bbLL\n1\n\nwhere \u03c4 = NHI /(1.6 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 ). At a higher frequency \u03bd, and approximating the photoionization cross section as proportional to \u03bd \u22123 , the mean free path is increased to \u03bb\u03bd \u2243\n\u03bb0 (\u03bd/\u03bdHI )1.5 .\nWe note here that our mean free path in (3) is 1.5 times longer than that adopted in\nMadau, Haardt, & Rees (1999), and in Schirber & Bullock (2002). For some reason, their\nopacity corresponds to a Lyman limit system abundance of 5 per unit redshift, larger than\nreported by Storrie-Lombardi et al. (1994).\n\n2.3.\n\nThe emissivity\n\nThe photoionization rate is related to the emissivity \u01eb\u03bd , the cross section \u03c3\u03bd , and the\nmean free path as a function of frequency by\nZ \u221e\n\u0393=\nd\u03bd \u01eb\u03bd \u03bb\u03bd \u03c3\u03bd .\n(4)\n\u03bdHI\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nHere, we use the approximation that the mean free path is much less than the horizon\ndistance (the exact relation between the emissivity and background intensity involves an\nintegration over time with redshift effects, a full knowledge of the spectrum, and reemission;\nsee Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Ostriker 1990; Haardt & Madau 1996; Fardal, Giroux, & Shull 1998.\nWe treat reemission approximately in \u00a72.4). Assuming that \u01eb\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b7\u22121 , \u03bb\u03bd \u221d \u03bd 1.5 , and\n\u03c3\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22123 , we have \u0393 = \u01eb0 \u03bb0 \u03c30 /(1.5 + \u03b7), where \u03c30 = 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221218 cm2 , and \u01eb0 is the emissivity\nper unit frequency at the ionization edge. The emissivity integrated over frequency is \u01ebi =\nR\nd\u03bd\u01eb\u03bd = \u01eb0 /\u03b7. The emissivity can be conveniently expressed as the number of ionizing\nphotons emitted per Hubble time and for each atom in the universe:\n\u221a\n\u03c0 (\u03b7 + 1.5) \u0393\n\u01ebi (z = 4)\n=\n,\n(5)\nH4 nat\n(0.06 \u00b1 0.01) \u03b7c\u03c30nat (1 + z)3\nwhere nat is the comoving number density of atoms (adding hydrogen and helium), nat =\n\u03a9b \u03c1crit /mH (1 \u2212 3Y /4) = 2.03 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22123 , and H4 is the Hubble constant at z = 4. Using\n\u0393\u221212 < 0.53, taking the lower limit for the mean free path (to obtain an upper limit for the\nemissivity), and assuming \u03b7 = 1.5, the final result is\n\u01ebi (z = 4)\n< 7.6 .\nH4 nat\n\n(6)\n\nIn other words, there are fewer than eight ionizing photons being emitted per Hubble time\nand for each atom at z = 4.\n\n2.4.\n\nEffect of reemission from the Ly\u03b1 absorbers\n\nSome of the photons that contribute to the photoionization rate in the intergalactic\nmedium arise from reemission by the Ly\u03b1 absorption systems (see Haardt & Madau 1996).\nFor every hydrogen atom that is photoionized by absorbing a photon, and assuming ionization\nequilibrium, a recombination will take place, and about 40% of the recombinations are direct\nto the ground state, producing another ionizing photon. However, the majority of the ionizing\nphotons that are not very close to the hydrogen ionization edge are absorbed deep within\nLyman limit systems, and the photons produced by recombinations in these regions are\nclose to the ionization edge [with a typical frequency separation from the Lyman limit of\n\u2206\u03bd/\u03bd \u2243 kT /(13.6 eV) \u2243 0.1] and not likely to escape from the Lyman limit system. Because\nof this, reemission by hydrogen recombination increases the background intensity by only\n\u223c 10% (as is found, for example, by using the approximation that the reemitted photons\nescape only when produced in an absorber of column density NHI < 2/\u03c30 , which is the\ncolumn density for which the typical optical depth for the photon to escape is unity).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSome photons are also emitted by helium recombinations. He I makes little difference to\nthe total budget of ionizing photons, because for each absorption by He I , one photon that\nionizes hydrogen is produced by the subsequent recombination. Because we did not include\nabsorption by He I in our previous estimate of the mean free path, we do not include the\nreemission either.\nFinally, photons with energy above 4 Rydbergs are mostly used to photoionize He II ,\nand each He II recombination can produce between one and three photons capable of ionizing\nhydrogen. About 25% of the recombinations that are not direct to the ground state go to\nn = 2, producing a Balmer continuum photon, which can ionize hydrogen. In addition, all\nthe recombinations produce either a Lyman series photon, or two continuum photons when\nthe last transition is from 2s to 1s; in \u223c 8% of the recombinations, two continuum photons\nthat can both ionize hydrogen are produced (see Osterbrock 1989, Tables 2.8, 4.11, and 4.12).\nHence, on average 1.33 ionizing photons are produced for each He II that is photoionized. For\na source spectrum \u01eb\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b7\u22121 , with \u03b7 = 1.5, the fraction of photons used to ionize He II is\n1/8, so He II reemission increases the emissivity by a factor 1 + 0.33/8 = 1.04. This factor\ncan be reduced during the He II reionization, when the rate of recombinations is less than\nthe rate of photoionizations.\nBased on this discussion of the effect of reemission from absorbers, we reduce our upper\nlimit in (6) for the total emissivity \u01ebi by a factor 1.14, to obtain the upper limit for the direct\nemissivity from sources \u01ebsi at z = 4 (rounded up to one digit given the various uncertainties\ndiscussed),\n\u01ebsi (z = 4)\n<7.\n(7)\nH4 nat\n\n3.\n\nComparison with the emissivity from Lyman break galaxies and QSOs\n3.1.\n\nQSOs\n\nFan et al. (2001) measured the following QSO luminosity function at high redshift\n(z & 3.5) from SDSS:\n\u0013\u2212\u03b3\n\u0012\ndL\nL\n\u22128\n\u22123\n,\n(8)\n10\u22120.47(z\u22123)\n\u03c8Q (L) dL = 7.8 \u00d7 10 Mpc\nL\u221226\nL\u221226\nwhere L\u221226 is the luminosity of a QSO with absolute AB magnitude M1450 = \u221226 at \u03bb =\n1450 \u00c5, and \u03b3 = 2.58. Using a power-law spectral index \u03b7Q = 1.5 for the QSO spectrum at\n\u03bb < 1450 \u00c5 (Telfer et al. 2002 find \u03b7Q = \u22121.57 at \u03bb < 1200 \u00c5for radio-quiet QSOs, and the\nspectral slope is shallower at longer wavelengths; e.g., Schmidt, Schneider, & Gunn 1995), the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntotal number of ionizing photons (with \u03bb < 912 \u00c5) emitted is L\u221226 = 5.48 \u00d7 1056 photons/s.\nThe luminosity function in equation (8) was observed down to L \u2243 0.5L\u221226 by Fan et\nal. (2001); the total emissivity from QSOs clearly depends on the luminosity at which the\nslope of \u03c8Q (L) becomes shallower than L\u22122 . If we assume the form \u03c8Q (L) \u221d [(L/LQ\u2217 )\u03b3\u22121 +\n(L/LQ\u2217 )\u03b3 ]\u22121 , which produces a similar slope of \u03c8(L) at low luminosities (L < L\u2217 ) as observed\nat lower redshift (e.g., Boyle et al. 1988, 2000), then the comoving emissivity is\n\u01ebQSO = 1.45 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221224\n\n\u0012\n\nL\u221226\nLQ\u2217\n\n\u0013\u03b3\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22120.47(z\u22123)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nx dx\nphotons s\u22121 cm\u22123 .\n+ x\u03b3\n\nx\u03b3\u22121\n\n(9)\n\nExpressing this as the number of photons emitted per Hubble time and per atom, at z = 4,\nwe find,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b3\u22122\nL\u221226\n\u01ebQSO\n= 0.61\n.\n(10)\nH(z = 4)nat\nL\u2217\nA lower limit to the emissivity from QSOs is obtained if L\u2217 \u2243 0.5L\u221226 , \u01ebQSO /(Hnat ) & 1.\nIn order not to exceed the upper limit obtained in the last section, \u01eb/[H(z = 4)nat ] < 7,\nwe must require LQ\u2217 > 0.015L\u221226 . We note, however, that low-luminosity QSOs may be\nintrinsically self-absorbed at the Lyman limit, reducing their contribution to the ionizing\nemissivity (see Alam & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2002).\nThe number of faint AGNs has been constrained by Steidel et al. (2002), who find\nthat their abundance at z = 3 and at an apparent AB magnitude R \u2243 23.9 (or luminosities\nL = 0.018L\u221226 ) is about 3% of the Lyman break galaxies abundance at a magnitude R = 24.6\nat z = 3. Using the Lyman break galaxy luminosity function given in the next subsection,\nwe find that this implies that the turnover of the QSO luminosity function should occur at\nLQ\u2217 = 0.046L\u221226 , assuming again the form \u03c8Q \u221d [(L/LQ\u2217 )\u03b3\u22121 + (L/LQ\u2217 )\u03b3 ]\u22121 . If the value\nof LQ\u2217 were the same at z = 4 as at z = 3 (but with the QSO abundance having declined\nas 10\u22120.47z at all luminosities, as in eq. [8]), QSOs would contribute about half of the total\nemissivity required at z = 4 from equation (7). There are also limits from the Hubble Deep\nField (Conti et al. 1999), but these probe QSOs at much lower luminosities and do not\nprovide a stronger constraint on LQ\u2217 . In summary, the available observations are consistent\nwith a contribution to the ionizing emissivity from QSOs that does not exceed the upper\nlimit in (7).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nLyman break galaxies\n\nThe galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function at high redshift has been measured by Steidel\net al. (1999). They fit the luminosity function to a Schechter function,\n\u03c6(L) dL = \u03c6\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\nL\nL\u2217\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\ne\u2212L/L\u2217\n\ndL\n.\nL\u2217\n\n(11)\n\nAfter converting to the flat cosmological model with \u03a9m = 0.3, h = 0.65, the parameters they\nfind are \u03c6\u2217 = 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123 , \u03b1 = 1.6, and L\u2217 = 1.4 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 at \u03bb = 1700 \u00c5. To\nconvert this to the ionizing luminosity, we use the models of Bruzual & Charlot (1993), for\nwhich the luminosity per unit frequency decreases by a factor 10 from \u03bb = 1700 \u00c5 to 912 \u00c5,\nfor an age of 109 years (these models assume a Salpeter mass function up to a maximum mass\nof 125M\u2299 and solar metallicity). Using also the approximation of L\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22122 at \u03bb < 912 \u00c5,\nwe find the ionizing luminosity is L\u2217 = 1.06 \u00d7 1054 photons/ s.\nThe form of the galaxy luminosity function (11) is highly uncertain at L . L\u2217 , because\nthe observations of Steidel et al. (1999) are not deep enough to reach lower luminosities, and\ngalaxies down to 10\u22120.8L\u2217 are only detected in the Hubble Deep Field (e.g., Madau et al.\n1996). The Hubble Deep Field counts at z = 4 are significantly below the prediction from the\nmodel in equation (11), but this may be due to galaxy clustering (Steidel et al. 1999; see their\nFig. 8). If we include only galaxies with luminosities larger than (L\u2217 , 10 \u2212 0.4L\u2217 , 10\u22120.8L\u2217 ),\nthe total emissivity inferred from (11) is\n\u01ebgal\n= (3.4, 8.5, 13.8)fesc\nH(z = 4)nat\n\n[L > (1, 10\u22120.4, 10\u22120.8 )L\u2217 ] .\n\n(12)\n\nSteidel, Pettini, & Adelberger (2001) found that Lyman break galaxies may have escape\nfractions of ionizing photons as large as 50%, from a possible detection of Lyman continuum flux after coadding spectra of several galaxies. If this result were true, the luminous\ngalaxies with L > 10\u22120.8 L\u2217 would already produce the maximum emissivity in equation (7).\nAlternatively, fesc may be much lower (see Giallongo et al. 2002; note also that the value\nfesc \u2243 0.5 measured by Steidel et al. 2001 was for the subset of bluest quartile of the Lyman\nbreak galaxies, which may not be representative), and lower luminosity objects may be responsible for the bulk of the emissivity. More accurate determinations of the escape fraction,\nthe abundance of Lyman limit systems, and the inferred photoionization rate from the Ly\u03b1\nforest transmitted flux will be needed to resolve this question.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n4.\n\nConstraints on the emissivity evolution to end reionization at z = 6\n\nThe highest redshift QSO known at the present time (Becker et al. 2001) shows a\ncomplete Gunn-Peterson trough at z \u2243 6, but the spectra of all the sources at lower redshift\nhave detectable transmitted flux blueward of Ly\u03b1 , indicating that most of the volume in the\nintergalactic medium had to be reionized by z = 6. We now address the contraint implied\nby this fact on the evolution of the ionizing emissivity, in view of its value at z = 4 (eq. 7).\n\n4.1.\n\nThe reionization equation\n\nReionization proceeds by the creation of ionized regions around individual sources\n(Arons & Wingert 1972). The mean free path of ionizing photons through the neutral\nmedium is typically very short compared to the distance between sources, so reionization\nproceeds by the growth of the ionized regions and can be modeled in terms of the fraction\nof the volume that is ionized at time t, y(t), assuming that the remaining fraction 1 \u2212 y is\ncompletely neutral. Moreover, because the emitted photons are used to ionize atoms almost\nimmediately after their emission, it follows that the change in the fraction of atoms that\nare ionized in the universe is equal to the ionizing photon emission rate per atom minus the\naverage recombination rate of atoms. If \u01eba (t) \u2261 \u01ebi (t)/nat is the comoving ionizing photon\nemissivity per atomic nucleus, R(t) is the average recombination rate per atom in ionized\nregions (which includes the effect of an effective clumping factor of the ionized gas), and Fi\nis the fraction of baryons that actually need to be ionized in the ionized fraction y of the\nuniverse (with the remaining 1 \u2212 Fi fraction being the baryons that are in dense systems,\nsuch as stars or dense gas in galaxies, that do not need to be ionized by external sources), the\nequation for the evolution of y is (Madau, Haardt, & Rees 1999; Miralda-Escud\u00e9, Haehnelt,\n& Rees 2000)\nd(yFi )\n= \u01eba \u2212 Ry .\n(13)\ndt\nThis equation (apart from the factor Fi ) is analogous to the one obtained for the problem\nof an expanding cosmological H II region around an ionizing source, which was discussed by\nShapiro & Giroux (1987) and Donahue & Shull (1987), where y behaves as the volume of\nthe H II region produced by a source of luminosity proportional to \u01eba (t). It is also identical\nto the equation of radiative transfer, where yFi plays the role of the intensity, and RFi\u22121\nand \u01eba play the role of the absorption and emission coefficients, respectively. The solution is\nfound through the substitutions d\u03c4 = RFi\u22121 dt, and w = yFi e\u03c4 :\nZ t\n\u2032\n\u22121\ny(t) = Fi\ndt\u2032 \u01eba (t\u2032 ) e\u03c4 (t )\u2212\u03c4 (t) ,\n(14)\nti\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nRt\nwhere \u03c4 (t) = 0 dt\u2032\u2032 Fi\u22121 R(t\u2032\u2032 ), and ti is the initial time when the first sources turn on.\nAssuming that any clumping factor is constant, and that \u03a9m (t) \u2243 1 [e.g., for the cosmological\nconstant model with a present matter density \u03a9m0 = 0.3, we have \u03a9m (z = 4) = 0.982], the\nrecombination rate varies as R(t) \u221d t\u22122 . Choosing t4 \u2261 t(z = 4) = (2/3)H4\u22121 as a fiducial\ntime, and R4 = R(t4 ), we have:\ny(t) =\n\nFi\u22121\n\nZ\n\nt\nt4\nti\nt4\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nt4 t4\n2\u01eba (t\u2032 )\n\u22121\n.\nexp R4 Fi t4\n\u2212 \u2032\nd(t /t4 )\n3H4\nt\nt\n\n4.2.\n\n\u2032\n\n(15)\n\nThe recombination rate\n\nBefore presenting solutions of the reionization equation, we discuss the value that we\nadopt for the recombination rate, R. The average recombination rate is affected by the\nclumping factor of the ionized gas, which we define as: Cl =< n2e >J / < ne >2J . The subscript\nJ is used here to denote that the average is to be taken only over those regions of space where\nmatter is predominantly photoionized by photons that have escaped to the intergalactic\nmedium. This restriction is necessary because if we did not impose it, the clumping factor\nwould be dominated by regions of dense gas that are locally ionized by sources that were not\nincluded in the emissivity in equation (6), precisely because the radiation from these sources\nis locally absorbed. In fact, in the absence of any restriction on the regions over which one\nmust average to obtain the clumping factor of ionized matter, then the clumping factor would\nobviously be very large and dominated by the densest stars. Once stars are eliminated from\nconsideration, there are still H II regions that form in dense clouds in the interstellar medium\nof galaxies around massive young stars, in which all the emitted photons are immediately\nabsorbed locally. This emission is irrelevant for the reionization of the intergalactic medium,\nand it is best not to include in equation (6), and at the same time not to include the dense\ngas ionized locally in the clumping factor. This definition of the clumping factor inevitably\ninvolves an arbitrary choice in defining when a photon is considered to be escaped, and\ntherefore when a region is predominantly ionized by escaped photons rather than local ones.\nIn practice, a photon can be defined to have escaped once it reaches an intergalactic region\nwith gas density below some critical value. The calculation of the clumping factor can only\nbe obtained from full radiative transfer simulations of reionization, but its value can differ\namong studies by large factors depending on the definition that is adopted (see Gnedin\n2000 and references therein). If the restriction that escaped photons dominate the radiation\nintensity is not imposed, then very large values of the clumping factor can be obtained, which\ncould only be used consistently by including the locally absorbed photons in the emissivity.\nHere, we use the simple model of Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. (2000) for the clumping factor,\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nwhich uses the approximation that the gas is ionized only up to an overdensity \u2206i = \u03c1i /\u03c1\u0304,\nand all the gas at higher densities is neutral, or otherwise is ionized locally and therefore\ndoes not contribute to the clumping factor. The overdensity \u2206i is related to the mean free\npath \u03bbi that a photon can traverse before being absorbed. During reionization, the mean\nfree path \u03bbi should be of order the size of the H II regions, or of order the typical separation\nbetween neighboring sources. For \u03bbi = 1000 km s\u22121 , or \u223c 10 Mpc at z = 6 in comoving units,\nthe critical overdensity is \u2206i \u2243 5, and the clumping factor is very close to unity (see Figs.\n2d and 6 in Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 2000).\nIt has been pointed out by Haiman, Abel, & Madau (2001) that before reionization\nis complete, a large number of low-mass halos should be present and should contain dense\ngas accreted before it was heated by reionization. The effect of these low-mass halos would\nbe to decrease the mean free path at a fixed overdensity \u2206i , and to widen the distribution\nof the overdensity. To estimate the plausible change in the clumping factor due to these\nlow-mass halos, we can assume that the structure of the atomic intergalactic medium before\nreionization is self-similar to that of the ionized intergalactic medium, but with the scales\nreduced in proportion to the Jeans scale \u03bbJ , so that the clumping factor should depend only\non the ratio \u03bbi /\u03bbJ , and the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations at the Jeans\nscale. If the temperature increases by a factor 100 during reionization (from \u223c 100 K to\n\u223c 104 K), the Jeans length increases by a factor 10. The amplitude of primordial density\nfluctuations in Cold Dark Matter with \u03a9m = 0.3 and h = 0.65 increases by a factor \u2243 2\nbetween the scales of 0.05 to 0.5 Mpc (roughly corresponding to the Jeans scales at these two\ntemperatures). Therefore, the clumping factor of a medium in which all the low-mass halos\nformed from scales intermediate between the Jeans scales of the atomic and ionized medium\nhave survived, at z = 7 and \u03bbi = 103 km s\u22121 , should be the same as the clumping factor\nof a medium with no such surviving halos, evaluated at z = 3 and \u03bbi = 104 km s\u22121 . From\nFigures 2b and 6 of Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. (2000), we find this clumping factor to be 7. We\nnote that this is an upper limit to the true clumping factor, because the gas in the low-mass\nhalos that might increase the clumping factor above the value of \u223c 1 found previously is\nlikely to evaporate on a time short compared to the Hubble time, once these halos have been\nreached by an ionization front (Shapiro & Raga 2001). The gas may also be expelled by a\nsmall amount of internal star formation even before the halo is reached by external ionizing\nradiation.\nFinally, a discussion is needed to decide if the case A or case B recombination coefficient\nshould be used. Ionizing photons of frequency \u03bd will typically be absorbed in regions of\ncolumn density NHI \u223c 1.6\u00d71017 cm\u22122 (\u03bd/\u03bdHI )3 , where \u03bdHI is the Lyman limit frequency. The\nsources typically have power-law spectra and most of the emitted photons have frequencies\nsubstantially above \u03bdHI , especially if the spectra are hardened by internal absorption. Most\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nof the photons emitted by direct recombinations to the ground state, which have frequencies\nvery close to the Lyman limit, will therefore be produced in high column density systems\nand will be reabsorbed within the same system (in addition, among the small fraction of\nphotons from direct recombinations to the ground state that escape the system in which\nthey have been produced, some will be redshifted below the Lyman limit and will not be\nabsorbed again). Hence, these photons do not contribute to increase the cosmic ionizing\nbackground intensity for the most part. An alternative way to understand this argument is\nthat, even though in principle we are in a case B situation because the recombination photons\nare reabsorbed, in practice the inclusion of the photons from recombinations increases the\nclumping factor by the ratio of the case A to case B recombination coefficients because these\nphotons increase the ionization in dense regions, therefore yielding a recombination rate\nequivalent to using case A. Therefore, we use the case A recombination coefficient.\n\n4.3.\n\nResults for the reionization history\n\nWe now compute y(t) assuming models where the emissivity varies as \u01eba \u221d (1 + z)\u2212\u03b2 \u221d\nt2\u03b2/3 for z > 4, and has the value \u01eba /H4 = 7 at z = 4, i.e., the maximum allowed value found\npreviously (eq. 7). We choose the recombination coefficient \u03b1 = 3.15 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 , valid\nfor case A and T = 1.5 \u00d7 104 K, and electron density ne = 6.95 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 at z = 6, valid\nfor \u03a9b h2 = 0.022 and if helium is only once ionized. This yields a recombination rate per\nHubble time R(z = 6)/H(z = 6) = 1.02. In some cases, we increase this recombination rate\nby a clumping factor Cl . We fix the fraction of baryons in the ionized regions that actually\nneed to be ionized to Fi = 0.9 (independent of redshift), in reasonable agreement with the\nfraction of baryons that seem to be present in damped Ly\u03b1 systems at z \u2243 4 (Lanzetta et al.\n1991; Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1996), and the fraction of baryons above the critical overdensity\n\u2206i \u2243 5 at z = 6 in the model discussed above for the clumping factor (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et\nal. 2000, Fig. 2d).\nWe solve equation (15), starting at y = 0 at some initial redshift zi when the emissivity\nis assumed to turn on suddenly. The parameters of the model that we vary are zi , \u03b2, and\nCl , and we require all models to reach y = 1 (i.e., the end of reionization) at z = 6.\nThe results of five representative models are shown in Figure 1. When Cl = 1, assuming\nthe emissivity to remain constant satisfies the requirement of completing reionization by\nz = 6 when the emissivity is turned on at zi = 8.7. With only a slight decline of the\nemissivity, the initial redshift needs to be pushed to much higher values. For \u03b2 = 0.63,\nwhich corresponds to a decline of the comoving emissivity by a factor of only \u223c 1.5 between\nz = 4 and z = 9, the sources need to start at very high redshift to reach y = 1 at z = 6.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Fraction of the volume of the universe filled by ionized regions as a function of\nredshift. The models assume the emissivity is equal to \u01eba /H(t) = 7[(1 + z)/5)]\u2212\u03b2 , at z < zi ,\nwhere zi is the initial redshift where the emission is turned on. The clumping factor of the\nionized gas is Cl . The models are constrained to reach a fraction of unity at z = 6. The\nelectron scattering optical depth to CMB photons is indicated for each model.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nNaturally, changes in the emissivity at redshifts higher than \u223c 15 are irrelevant for the\nrequirement that reionization ends at z = 6, because most of the atoms ionized at this high\nredshift will recombine again. We therefore conclude that, for the case of no clumping, the\nionizing emissivity at 6 < z . 9 cannot be much lower than its maximum value allowed at\nz = 4. In other words, the sources responsible for the emission of ionizing radiation cannot\ndecrease their overall comoving emissivity by more than a factor \u223c 1.5 between z = 4 and\nz = 9.\nAllowing now for a clumping factor, an increase to Cl = 2.1 already requires the model\nwith constant emissivity (\u03b2 = 0) to maintain the emissivity up to a very high initial redshift.\nA model where the same amount of radiative energy is emitted at every Hubble time [i.e.,\n\u03b2 = \u22121.5, since H(z) \u221d (1 + z)1.5 ], starting at very high zi , results in complete reionization\nat z = 6 when Cl = 5.8. Therefore, for a clumping factor as large as \u223c 7, as suggested\npreviously for a model where the ionized gas in all low-mass halos is retained, the emissivity\nwould need to substantially increase with redshift.\n\n4.4.\n\nComparison to the observed evolution at z < 4\n\nWe have shown that by combining the measurement of the ionizing emissivity \u01ebi at\nz = 4 with the requirement that the reionization must end by z = 6, we can infer that\nthe emissivity does not decrease with redshift by more than a factor \u223c 1.5 from z = 4 to\nz = 9. We can now ask how this evolutionary constraint compares to the evolution at z < 4\nthat is implied by observations of the Ly\u03b1 forest decrement and the mean free path between\nLyman limit systems. From McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (2001), the photoionization rate\n(or proper intensity of the background) declines roughly as (1 + z)\u22121.5 from z = 2.5 to\nz = 4. The abundance of Lyman limit systems per unit redshift is proportional to (1 + z)1.5\n(Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1994), implying that the proper mean free path varies as (1 + z)\u22124 .\nHence, the comoving emissivity evolves as (1 + z)\u22120.5 , essentially constant within the likely\nerrors of measurement for both the proper intensity and mean free path evolution. Therefore,\nthe results of \u00a74.3 show that if the clumping factor is low, this constant emissivity needs to\nroughly maintained at the same value up to z \u223c 9, while if the clumping factor is much larger\nthan one, the emissivity needs to modify its evolution and increase strongly with redshift at\nz > 4.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n4.5.\n\nThe Thomson optical depth of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n\nThe optical depth of Cosmic Microwave Background photons to electron scattering, \u03c4es ,\nis given by\nZ zi\nc dt\nne0 (1 + z)3 \u03c3es y(z) Fi ,\n(16)\n\u03c4es =\ndz\ndz\n0\nwhere \u03c3es is the Thomson cross section for electron scattering. The values of \u03c4es for the five\nmodels in Figure 1 are indicated in the figure. We have assumed Fi = 0.9 at all redshifts;\nthe 10% of the matter not included is supposed to be either gas that remains atomic or\nmolecular in self-shielded regions, or stars.\nThese results show that the minimum allowed value of \u03c4es , which occurs for models where\nthe emissivity turns on at a redshift not much larger than 6, is \u223c 0.045. The maximum values\nof the optical depth depend on the emissivity at high redshift. If the emissivity does not\nincrease with redshift, then the ionized fraction of the volume at high redshift needs to be\nsmall due to the fast rate of recombinations (i.e., for constant emissivity, y \u221d (1 + z)\u22123 , and\nthe integral in eq. [16] converges rapidly at high z). For a model with a constant emissivity\nup to zi = 20 and clumping factor equal to one, the optical depth can be increased only up\nto \u03c4es = 0.09 (in this model, reionization ends at z = 7.3, but the reionization end could\nalways be delayed by increasing the clumping factor as the fraction y reaches a value close\nto unity).\nAn emissivity increasing with redshift can obviously produce larger optical depths, and\nas mentioned before the value of the emissivity at z & 15 does not affect the epoch at which\nreionization ends, so in principle the optical depth could be arbitrarily high if enough ionizing\nsources were present at very high redshift. However, in the flat Cold Dark Matter model\nwith \u03a9m = 0.3, which is strongly supported by all observations of large-scale structure,\nthe first stars form only at z \u2243 20 from 3 \u2212 \u03c3 peaks collapsing into the first low-mass halos\n(e.g., Couchman & Rees 1986; Bromm, Coppi, & Larson 1999; Abel, Bryan, & Norman 2000;\nRicotti, Gnedin, & Shull 2002; Venkatessan, Tumlinson, & Shull 2003), and so the emissivity\ncannot continue to increase up to a very high redshift. At the same time, observations\nindicate a cosmic star formation rate in galaxies that starts to decline with redshift at z & 2\n(Madau, Pozzetti, & Dickinson 1998), although the ionizing emissivity might increase with\nredshift even when the star formation rate decreases because of an increasing escape fraction\nfor ionizing photons.\nAs this paper was being refereed, the results of the WMAP mission were announced.\nKogut et al. (2003) give a result \u03c4e = 0.16\u00b10.04 from a model-independent analysis, although\nthe result and the error can change when fitted to different CDM models (Spergel et al. 2003).\nThe value of \u223c 0.08 implied by a constant emissivity with clumping factor of one up to very\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nhigh redshift would represent a 2 \u2212 \u03c3 deviation from the value of Kogut et al. (2003). A\nvalue as high as \u03c4e = 0.16 would clearly imply a substantial increase of the emissivity up to\nz \u223c 20, when only a small fraction of the mass has collapsed into halos that can form stars\nin the CDM model.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe observed mean transmitted flux of the Ly\u03b1 forest, when combined with independently measured values of the mean baryon density, the amplitude of the power spectrum,\nand the gas temperature, yields a measurement of the intensity of the ionizing background.\nThe abundance of Lyman limit systems determines the mean free path of ionizing photons.\nThese two quantities together determine the ionizing emissivity. We have argued in this\npaper that the emissivity measured in this way at z = 4 is at most 7 ionizing photons per\natom per Hubble time. We have then shown that the emissivity over the redshift range\n6 < z . 9 cannot be much lower than the value at z = 4 in order that the universe can\nbe reionized by z = 6, if the clumping factor of ionized gas during the reionization epoch is\nclose to unity. If the clumping factor is larger than unity, then the ionizing emissivity must\nincrease with redshift between z = 4 and z \u223c 9.\nThe electron scattering optical depth must be at least 0.045, given the presence of ionized\nintergalactic gas at z < 6, and a reasonable minimum redshift range over which sources ionize\nthe universe at z > 6. If the emissivity of ionizing photons does not increase with redshift\nat z > 4, then the optical depth must be less than 0.09. Measurements of the optical depth\nfrom the CMB spectrum of temperature and polarization fluctuations therefore provide a\npowerful diagnostic to decide if the peak of the comoving ionizing emissivity occurred at\nz \u223c 4 (with a broad plateau extending up to z \u223c 9 so that the end of reionization can be\nreached by z = 6), or at a much earlier epoch. The recent WMAP result has an error that is\nstill too large to reach a definite conclusion, but if a value \u03c4e \u2243 0.16 is confirmed it implies\nthat the comoving emissivity continues to rise up to z \u2243 20.\nThis work was supported in part by grant NSF-0098515.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAbel, T., Bryan, G.
