Note that the second theorem is different\nfrom the first one.\n\u00a71. Introduction and Main results\nThe study of n-dimensional knots and links has a long history. The research\nwas connected with surgery theory. (See [9], [20] etc. for the history. ) There\nare many fruitful results. There are many outstanding problems. For example,\nn-links have not been classified. (This open problem is not discussed explicitly\nin this paper but it is one of motivations of this paper.)\nWhen we study n-knots and n-links (n \u2265 2), we sometimes see similarities\nand differences between the theory of 1-links and that of n-links. In this paper\nwe point out one difference between them, associated with the projections of\nknots. (Theorem 1.3.).\nWhen one studies classical knots (in R3 ), it is important to consider the\nprojections of knots into R2 . See [1], [3], [8], [12], [16], [23], [25], etc. For 2dimensional knots in R4 , one considers the projections of 2-knots into R3 . See\n[2], [4], [5], [7], [10], etc.\nIn order to state our problems (Problem 1.1 and 1.2) and our main theorem\n(Theorem 1.3.), we prepare some definitions on n-knots and on their projections.\nWe work in the smooth category.\nAn (oriented) n-(dimensional) knot K is a smooth oriented submanifold of\nRn+1 \u00d7 R which is PL homeomorphic to the standard n-sphere. We say that\nn-knots K1 and K2 are equivalent if there exists an orientation preserving\n\nMathematics Subject Classification (1991): 57M25, 57Q45\nThis research was partially supported by Research Fellowships of the Promotion of Science for\nYoung Scientists.\nKeywords. The projections of n-knots, Kummer surface, spun knots\n1\n\n\fdiffeomorphism f : Rn+1 \u00d7 R \u2192 Rn+1 \u00d7 R\nsuch that f (K1 )=K2 and f |K1 : K1 \u2192 K2 is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism. We say that n-knots K1 and K2 are identical if id(K1 )=K2 holds\nfor the identity map id : Rn+1 \u00d7 R \u2192 Rn+1 \u00d7 R and id|K1 : K1 \u2192 K2 is an\norientation preserving diffeomorphism.\nLet T be the unit n-sphere in Rn+1 \u00d7 {0} \u2282 Rn+1 \u00d7 R. An n-knot K is said\nto be unknotted if K is equivalent to T .\nLet \u03c0: Rn+1 \u00d7 R \u2192 Rn+1 be the natural projection map. We assume \u03c0|K\nis a self-transverse immersion. The projection P of an n-knot K is \u03c0|K (K) in\nRn+1 . We give P an orientation by using the orientation of K. The singular\npoint set of the projection of an n-knot K is the set { x \u2208 \u03c0|K (K) | \u266f{(\u03c0|K )\n\u22121\n(x)} \u2267 2.}.\nIt is well-known that the projection of any 1-dimensional knot is the projection\nof an unknotted 1-knot. This fact is used in the definition of the Jones polynomial. It is also used in some definitions of the Conway-Alexander polynomial.\nSee, e.g., [13], and [14].\nIt is natural to ask the following question.\nProblem 1.1. Let P be the projection of an n-knot K. Let K be diffeomorphic\nto the standard sphere. Is P necessarily the projection of an unknotted n-knot?\nIn this paper we give a negative answer to Problem 1.1 when n > 2.\nThe problem in the case n = 2 is still open. As mentioned above, the answer\nin the case n = 1 is affirmative.\nNote that, when n = 1, the singular point set always consists of double points.\nHere, we consider the following problem 1.2. Obviously, if the answer to\nProblem 1.2 is negative, the answer to Problem 1.1 is negative. Of course, as\nmentioned above, the answer to Problem 1.2 for n = 1 is affirmative.\nProblem 1.2. Let P be the projection of an n-knot K. Let K be diffeomorphic\nto the standard sphere. Suppose that the singular point set of P consists of\ndouble points. Then does it follow that P is the projection of an unknotted\nn-knot?\nIn this paper we prove that the answer to Problem 1.2 in the case n \u2267 3 is\nnegative and hence the answer to Problem 1.1 in the case n \u2267 3 is also negative.\nTheorem 1.3. Let n be any integer greater than two. Then there exists a\nprojection P having the following properties.\n(1) P is not the projection of any unknotted knot.\n(2) The singular point set of P consists of double points.\n(3) P is the projection of an n-knot which is diffeomorphic to the standard\nsphere.\nIn \u00a74 we prove there exists an immersed n-sphere ( \u2282 Rn+1 \u00d7 {0} ) which is\nnot the projection of any n-knot (n > 2) (Theorem 4.1). Note that this theorem\nis different from Theorem 1.3.\n\u00a72. Proof of Theorem 1.3 in the case n = 3\nLet V be the punctured Kummer surface. It is known that V has the following\n2\n\n\fproperties. See, e.g., p.9 of [15].\n(1) The intersection matrix is \u22953\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22952 E8 . The signature \u03c3(V ) is\n\nequal to \u221216.\n(2) There exists a handle decomposition with one 0-handle and twenty-two\n2-handles.\nWe prove:\nLemma 2.1. There exist an immersion \u03b1 : V # R4 and charts (Ui , \u03c6i ) of R4\nwith the following properties. (i = 1, ..., \u03bc, where \u03bc is a positive integer. )\n(i) U1 \u222a...\u222a U\u03bc covers the singular point set of \u03b1(V ).\n(ii) Ui \u2229 Uj = \u03c6 for i 6= j.\n(iii) \u03c6i :Ui \u223c\n= {(x, y, z, w)| x2 + y 2 + z 2 + w2 < 1}.\n\u03c6i \u25e6 \u03b1|V2i\n\n(iv) \u03b1\u22121 (Ui ) consists of two components V1i and V2i and \u03c6i \u25e6 \u03b1|V1i and\n\nare embeddings. Furthermore:\n\u03c6i \u25e6\u03b1(V1i )= {(x, y, z, w)| x2 +y 2 < 1, z 2 +w2 \u2266 41 }.\n\u03b1(V2i )= {(x, y, z, w)| x2 + y 2 \u2266 41 , z 2 + w2 < 1}.\n\n\u03c6i \u25e6\n\n2\nProof. Take the handle decomposition of V = h0 \u222a(\u222a22\ni=1 hi ) associated with the\nframed link given on p.9 of [15]. Let LV =(KV,1 , ..., KV,22 ) denote this framed\nlink. As described in [15], the framing of KV,1 is zero and the framing of KV,i\nis \u22122 for i 6= 1. The underlying link is also denoted by LV . The framing of\nattaching h2i is that of KV,1 .\n\nConsider R4 as R3 \u00d7 {t|t \u2208 R}. Take an embedded closed 4-ball B 4 in R3 \u00d7\n{t|t \u2208 R} so that B 4 \u2282 R3 \u00d7 {t|t \u2266 0} and B 4 \u2229 (R3 \u00d7 {t|t = 0}) is the 3-ball\nD3 . Take LV in Int D3 .\nRecall the following. Suppose R21 and R22 intersect transversely in R4 . Suppose\n2\nR1 , R22 , R4 are oriented. Suppose R21 \u2229 R22 is one point p. Then we can define\nthe signature \u03c3(p) for p by using the orientations of R21 , R22 , R4 .\n2\nSublemma. There exists a self-transverse immersion f : D12 \u2210 ... \u2210 D22\n#\n3\nR \u00d7 [0, \u221e) with the following properties.\n2\n(1) f is transverse to R3 \u00d7 {0}. f (D12 \u2210 ... \u2210 D22\n)\u2229 R3 \u00d7 {0} = f (\u2202D12 \u2210 ... \u2210\n2\n\u2202D22 ).\n2\n(2) f |\u2202D12 \u2210...\u2210\u2202D22\nis an embedding.\n2\n(3) f (\u2202D12 \u2210 ... \u2210 \u2202D22\n) in R3 \u00d7 {0} is LV .\n(4) Let pij be the singular points of f (Di2 ). We have\n\u001a\n0\nfor i = 1\n\u03a3j \u03c3(pij ) =\n\u22121 for i = 2, .., 22.\n2\nProof. Since \u03c01 (R3 \u00d7[0, 1)) = 1, there is a map g : D12 \u2210...\u2210D22\n# R3 \u00d7[0, \u221e)\n2\nsuch that g(\u2202Di ) = KV,i . Perturb g and make g self-transverse. Let qik be the\nsingular points of g(Di2 ).\n\n3\n\n\fWe prove: There is a self-transverse immersed 2-sphere S\u03b5 \u2282 R3 \u00d7 (0, \u221e)\n(\u03b5 = +1, \u22121) such that the singular point set is one point and its signature is \u03b5.\nBecause: Take X = {(a, b, c, d)|a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 \u2266 1} \u2282 R3 \u00d7 (0, \u221e).\nPut D12 = {(a, b, c, d)|a2 + b2 \u2266 1, c = d = 0}. Put D22 = {(a, b, c, d)|a = b =\n0, c2 + d2 \u2266 1}. Then H = (\u2202D12 , \u2202D22 ) in the 3-sphere \u2202X is the Hopf link.\nTake a Seifert surface A for H which is diffeomorphic to S 1 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]. Then\n2\nD1 \u222a A \u222a D2 is an example of S+1\n.\n2\n2\n2\nPut D1 = {(a, b, c, d)|a + c \u2266 1, b = d = 0} and D22 = {(a, b, c, d)|a = c =\n2\n0, b2 + d2 \u2266 1} instead. Then we obtain S\u22121\n. This completes the proof.\nWe continue the proof of Sublemma. Take a connected sum of S\u03b52 and g(D\u03bc2 ).\n2\nThen we obtain an immersed 2-disc D. Put g \u2032 : D12 \u2210 ... \u2210 D22\n# R3 \u00d7 [0, \u221e) so\n\u2032\n2\n2\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\nthat g (Di ) = g(Di ) for i 6= \u03bc and g (D\u03bc ) = D. Let qik\u2032 be the singular points\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof g \u2032 (Di2 ). Then \u03a3k\u2032 \u03c3(qik\n\u2032 ) = \u03a3k \u03c3(qik ) for i 6= \u03bc and \u03a3k\u2032 \u03c3(q\u03bck\u2032 ) = \u03a3k \u03c3(q\u03bck ) + \u03b5.\nWe make f in Sublemma from the above g. Suppose \u03a3k \u03c3(qik ) 6= \u03a3j \u03c3(pij ).\nBy using immersed spheres as S\u03b52 and using operations as above, we modify g\nto obtain f . This completes the proof of Sublemma.\nLet \u03bdi be the normal D2 -bundle of Di2 in R3 \u00d7 [0, \u221e). Let Ei be the total\nspace of \u03bdi . Note Ei \u223c\n= Di2 \u00d7D2 . Here, we have an immersion \u03b2i : Ei # R3 \u00d7{0}.\n4\nNote \u03b2i (Ei ) \u2229 B = (\u2202Di2 ) \u00d7 D2 \u2282 R3 \u00d7 {0}. Let W = B 4 \u222a (\u222a22\ni=1 Ei ). Here,\n4\n4\nE\n)\n#\nR\nsuch\nthat\n\u03b2(B\n) = B 4 and\nwe have an immersion \u03b2 : W = B 4 \u222a (\u222a22\ni\ni=1\n22\n\u03b2(Ei ) = \u03b2i (Ei ). Note we can regard \u222ai=1 Ei as 4-dimensional 2-handles attached\n2\nto B 4 along LV . Ei is called hi . We write W = h0 \u222a (\u222a22\ni=1 hi ).\nWe prove: The framing of attaching h2i is 2 * \u03a3j \u03c3(pij ).\nProof. We perturb Di2 = Di2 \u00d7 {0} in h2i = Ei = Di2 \u00d7 D2 so that we perturb\n\u2202Di2 in \u2202h2i . The result is called D\u0304i2 . Suppose Di2 and D\u0304i2 intersect transversely.\nSuppose (\u2202Di2 , \u2202 D\u0304i2 ) in R3 \u00d7 {0} is the trivial link. By the definition of the\nframing, the algebraic intersection number of Di2 \u2229 D\u0304i2 is the framing. Note\nthat the points Di2 \u2229 D\u0304i2 exist arround the points pij . The algebraic intersection\nnumber is 2 * \u03a3j \u03c3(pij ). This completes the proof.\n2\nHence W = h0 \u222a (\u222a22\ni=1 hi ) is V . This completes the proof of Lemma 2.1.\nWe use Lemma 2.1 and prove the following Proposition 2.2.\nBy the definition of 3-knots, all 3-knots are diffeomorphic to the standard\nsphere. Hence Proposition 2.2 induces Theorem 1.3 in the case n = 3.\n\nProposition 2.2. Let r be any integer. Then there exists a projection P having\nthe following properties.\n(1) If the projection of K is P , K is not unknotted.\n(2) If the projection of K is P , \u03c3(K) = 16r.\n(3) The singular point set of P consists of double points.\nNote. An integer \u03c3 is the signature of a 3-knot if and only if \u03c3 is a multiple\nof sixteen. See, e.g., \u00a710 of [19].\nProof of Proposition 2.2. We first prove Proposition 2.2 when r = \u22121.\nConsider \u03b1 : V # R4 in Lemma 2.1 as \u03b1 : V # R4 \u00d7 {0} (\u2282 R4 \u00d7 R). Let \u03b2\nbe the self-transverse immersion \u03b1|\u2202V =S 3 :S 3 # R4 \u00d7 {0}. We prove\n4\n\n\fLemma. \u03b2(S 3 ) is the projection of a 3-knot (\u2282 R4 \u00d7 R).\nProof. Let \u03c0 : R4 \u00d7 R \u2192 R4 \u00d7 {0} be the natural projection map. There is\na submanifold B which is diffeomorphic to V such that \u03c0(B) = \u03b1(V ). Because:\nThe immersion \u03b1 is an embedding in {R4 \u2212 (U1 \u222a ... \u222a U\u03bc )} \u00d7 R. In each Ui , push\n\u03b1(V1i ) into the direction of R4 \u00d7 {t|t > 0} (or R4 \u00d7 {t|t < 0} ) so that \u03b1(V2i ) is\nfixed. Thus we obtain a submanifold B which is diffeomorphic to V such that\n\u03c0(B) = \u03b1(V ).\nHence \u03b2(S 3 ) is the projection of the 3-knot \u2202B. This completes the proof of\nthe Lemma.\nLet P denote the projection \u03b2(S 3 ).\nClaim 2.3. P satisfies conditions (1)(2)(3) of Proposition 2.2 when r = \u22121.\nProof of Claim 2.3.\nLet Q be the singular point set of P . By the\nconstruction of \u03b1 and \u03b2, we have\n(1) Q \u2282 (U1 \u222a ... \u222a U\u03bc ) \u00d7 {t = 0}\n(2)Q \u2229 Ui is S 1 \u00d7 S 1 . (In particular, see Lemma 2.1(iv). ) Hence Q \u2229 Ui is\nconnected.\n(3)Q \u2229 Ui consists of double points.\nHence P satisfies condition (3) of Proposition 2.2.\nLet A be a 3-knot whose projection is P . Put W1i =(\u03c0|A)\u22121 (\u2202V1i )\nand W2i =(\u03c0|A)\u22121 (\u2202V2i ). Recall that P \u2283 \u2202V1i and P \u2283 \u2202V2i . Here, we write\nVji for \u03b1(Vji ).\nWe assign to the 3-knot A an element \u03c1(A) \u2208 Z\u03bc2 given as follows. Let\nZ2 = {+1, \u22121}. If W1i is over (resp. under ) W2i , then we define the i-th\ncoordinate of \u03c1(A) to be +1(resp. \u2212 1). We define 'over' and 'under' by using\nthe direction of Rt .\nNote the following. (1)Let A\u2032 be a 3-knot whose projection is P . If \u03c1(A\u2032 ) =\n\u03c1(A), then A\u2032 is equivalent to A. (2)For any element x \u2208 Z\u03bc2 , there is such a\n3-knot K with \u03c1(K) = x.\nLet B be a submanifold which is diffeomorphic to V such that \u03c0(B) = \u03b1(V ).\nPut X1i =(\u03c0|A)\u22121 (V1i ) and X2i =(\u03c0|A)\u22121 (V2i ). We give the submanifold B an\nelement \u03c1(B) \u2208 Z\u03bc2 as follows. If X1i is over (resp. under ) X2i , then we define\nthe i-th coordinate of \u03c1(B) to be +1(resp. \u2212 1).\nNote the following. (1)Let B \u2032 be a submanifold which is diffeomorphic to V\nsuch that \u03c0(B \u2032 ) = \u03b1(V ). If \u03c1(B \u2032 ) = \u03c1(B), then the submanifold B \u2032 is equivalent\nto the submanifold B. (2)For any element x \u2208 Z\u03bc2 , there is such a submanifold\nB with \u03c1(B) = x.\nTake a 3-knot A whose projection is P . Then there is a submanifold B which is\ndiffeomorphic to V such that \u03c1(B) = \u03c1(A). Since \u03c1(B) = \u03c1(\u2202B), \u03c1(\u2202B) = \u03c1(A).\nHence the 3-knot A is equivalent to the 3-knot \u2202B. Therefore A has a Seifert\nhypersurface which is diffeomorphic to V . Hence the signature of A is \u221216.\nTherefore A is knotted. Hence P satisfies conditions (1) (2) of Proposition 2.2.\nThis completes the proof of Claim 2.3 and thus the proof of Proposition 2.2\nin the case r = \u22121. We next prove Proposition 2.2 when r 6= \u22121. We divided\nthe proof into the three cases, r < \u22121, r = 0, r \u2267 1.\n5\n\n\fLet \u2212P denote what we obtain from P when we give the opposite orientation to P . Let P \u2217 denote what we obtain from P when we give the opposite\norientation to S 3 .\nWe prove Proposition 2.2 when r < \u22121. Let P\u0304 be an immersed 3-sphere in\nR4 \u00d7 {0} = R3 \u00d7 Rw \u00d7 {0}. Suppose P\u0304 \u2282 R3 \u00d7 {w|0 \u2266 w \u2266 |r|} \u00d7 {0}. For\neach s \u2208 \u039b = {0, 1..., |r|}, suppose that P\u0304 \u2229 (R3 \u00d7 {w = s} \u00d7 {0} ) is a 2-sphere\nwhich bounds a 3-disc Ds embedded in R3 \u00d7 {w = s} \u00d7{0}. If s, s + 1 \u2208 \u039b, put\n3\nPs+1 = P\u0304 \u2229 (R3 \u00d7 {s \u2266 w \u2266 s + 1} \u00d7 {0} ). Suppose Ps+1 \u222a Ds3 \u222a Ds+1\nis a\nparallel displacement of P . Then P\u0304 is the projection of a 3-knot. So P\u0304 satisfies\ncondition (3) of Proposition 2.2. It also follows that the 3-knots with projection\nP\u0304 are of the form K1 \u266f... \u266f K|r| , where the projection of K\u2217 is P . Note that\n|r|\n\n\u03c3 (K1 \u266f... \u266fK|r| ) = \u03a3\u2217=1 \u03c3(K\u2217 ) =\u221216|r| =16r. Hence P\u0304 satisfies condition (2)\nof Proposition 2.2. Also each K1 \u266f... \u266fK|r| is not unknotted. Hence P\u0304 satisfies\ncondition (1) of Proposition 2.2. This completes the proof of Proposition 2.2 in\nthe case of r < \u22121.\nWe now prove Proposition 2.2 when r \u2267 1. Let P\u0304 be as above. Take \u2212P\u0304 .\nThen \u2212P\u0304 satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.2 when r \u2267 1.\nFinally, we prove Proposition 2.2 when r = 0. Let P\u0302 be an immersed 3-sphere\nin R4 \u00d7 {0} = R3 \u00d7 Rw \u00d7 {0}. Suppose P\u0302 \u2229 (R3 \u00d7 {w = 0} \u00d7 {0} ) is a 2-sphere\nwhich bounds a 3-disc D embedded in R3 \u00d7 {w = 0} \u00d7{0}. Suppose [P\u0302 \u2229 (R3 \u00d7\n{w \u2267 0}\u00d7{0}] \u222aD is a parallel displacement of P and [P\u0302 \u2229 (R3 \u00d7 {w \u2266 0}\u00d7{0}]\n\u222aD is a parallel displacement of \u2212P \u2217 . Then P\u0302 is the projection of a 3-knot. So\nP\u0302 satisfies condition (3) of Proposition 2.2. It also follows that all 3-knots with\nprojection P\u0302 are of the form K1 \u266f(\u2212K2\u2217 ), where the projection of K\u2217 is P . Note\nthat \u03c3 (K1 \u266f(\u2212K2\u2217 )) = \u03c3(K1 ) + \u03c3(\u2212K2\u2217 ) =0. Hence P\u0302 satisfies condition (2) of\nProposition 2.2.\nIn order to prove that P\u0302 satisfies condition (1) of Proposition 2.2, we prove\nthat each K1 \u266f(\u2212K2\u2217 ) is not unknotted. We begin by recalling the following fact.\nSee, e.g., \u00a714 of [19] for the Alexander polynomials. See, e.g., \u00a76 of [19] for simple\nknots. The author gives a proof in the appendix.\nTheorem 2.4 (known). Let K be a simple (2k + 1)-knot (k \u2265 1). Then the\nAlexander polynomial of K is trivial if and only if K is unknotted.\nK1 and K2 are 3-knots whose projections are P . Then Ki bounds a Seifert\nhypersurface diffeomorphic to the punctured Kummer surface V . Hence Ki\nbounds a simply connected Seifert hypersurface. So Ki is a simple knot. Since\n\u03c3(V ) 6= 0, K1 is not unknotted and \u2212K2\u2217 is not unknotted. Therefore the\nAlexander polynomial \u2206K1 (t) of K2 is nontrivial and the Alexander polynomial\n\u2206\u2212K2\u2217 (t) of \u2212K2\u2217 is also nontrivial.\nRecall the following fact.\nTheorem (known). Let K1 and K2 be (2k + 1)-knots (k \u2265 1). Suppose the\nAlexander polynomial of each Ki is nontrivial. Then the Alexander polynomial\nof K1 \u266fK2 is also nontrivial.\nFrom this we conclude that each K1 \u266f(\u2212K2\u2217 ) is not unknotted.\n6\n\n\fThis proves condition (1) of Proposition 2.2 in the case r = 0 and thus completes the proof of Proposition 2.2. We conclude that Theorem 1.3 holds in the\ncase of n = 3.\n\u00a73. Proof of Theorem 1.3 in the case n > 3\nWe define the spun projection of a projection. Let P be the projection of\nan n-knot K. Suppose K \u2282 Rn \u00d7 Rt \u00d7 Ru and P \u2282 Rn \u00d7 {t = 0} \u00d7 Ru . Let\n\u03c0 : Rn \u00d7 Rt \u00d7 Ru \u2192 Rn \u00d7 {t = 0} \u00d7 Ru be the natural projection map. We\nsuppose P \u2282 Rn \u00d7 {t = 0} \u00d7 {u \u2267 0} and that P \u2229 (Rn \u00d7 {t = 0} \u00d7 {u = 0}) is\nan n-disc D embedded in Rn \u00d7 {t = 0} \u00d7 {u = 0}.

By Proposition 2.2, there is a 3-knot K (3) which is diffeomorphic to\nthe standard sphere and whose projection is P (3) . Suppose K (n+1) is the spun\nknot of K (n) (n \u2267 3). By induction on n, K (n) is diffeomorphic to the standard\nsphere(n \u2267 3). By Lemma 3.1, P (n) is the projection of K (n) . Hence P (n)\nsatisfies condition (3) of Theorem 1.3.\nLet Q(n) be the singular point set of P (n) . By Lemma 3.2, Q(n) consists of\ndouble points. Hence P (n) satisfies condition (2) of Theorem 1.3.\nIn order to prove P (n) satisfies condition (1) of Theorem 1.3, we prove:\nLemma 3.4. Let X be an (n + 1)-knot whose projection is P (n+1) .

By Lemma 3.2, The number of the connected components of Q(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n+1)\nis \u03bc. Let Q1 , ..., Q\u03bc be the connected components of Q(n) .

By Lemma 3.1, the projection of Ye\nis P (n+1) . Then \u03c1(Ye ) = \u03c1(Y ). Hence \u03c1(Ye ) = \u03c1(X), so the (n + 1)-knot X is\nequivalent to the (n + 1)-knot Ye .

Let \u03c0 : Rn+1 \u00d7 R \u2192 Rn+1 \u00d7 {0} be the natural projection map. We\nregard an immersed n-sphere A as in Rn+1 \u00d7 {0}. We say that A lifts (into\nRn+1 \u00d7 R ) if there is an n-knot K whose projection is A. Then K is called a\nlift.\nIt is natural to ask the following question.\nProblem. Do all immersed n-spheres (\u2282 Rn+1 \u00d7 {0}) lift into Rn+1 \u00d7 R?\nIt is well-known that, when n = 1, the answer is affirmative. [10] proved:\nwhen n = 2, the answer is negative. ( [6] gave an alternative proof.)\nIn this section, we give the negative answer to the above Problem in the case\nn > 2.\nTheorem 4.1. Let n be any integer greater than two. There exists an immersed\nn-sphere (\u2282 Rn+1 \u00d7 {0}) which does not lift into Rn+1 \u00d7 R.\nNote. Theorem 4.1 is different from Theorem 1.3.\n9\n\n\fProof of Theorem 4.1. We define the spun immersed (n + 1)-sphere of an\nimmersed n-sphere. Let A be an immersed n-sphere. Take Rn \u00d7 {x|x \u2208 R} \u00d7\n{y|y \u2208 R}. We suppose A \u2282 Rn \u00d7{x \u2267 0}\u00d7{y = 0}. We suppose A\u2229(Rn \u00d7{x =\n0}\u00d7{y = 0}) is an n-disc D embedded in Rn \u00d7{x = 0}\u00d7{y = 0}. We suppose D\ndoes not intersect the singular point set of A. We regard Rn \u00d7{x|x \u2208 R}\u00d7{y|y \u2208\nR} as the result of rotating\nRn \u00d7 {x \u2267 0} \u00d7 {y = 0} around the axis Rn \u00d7 Rt \u00d7 {x = 0} \u00d7 {y = 0}. When\nwe rotate\nRn \u00d7 {x \u2267 0} \u00d7 {y = 0} around the axis Rn \u00d7 Rt \u00d7 {x = 0} \u00d7 {y = 0}, we rotate\ne is called the spun immersed (n+1)-sphere\nA \u2212 D as well. The result, denoted A,\nof A.\nWe regard Rn \u00d7 {x|x \u2208 R} \u00d7 {y|y \u2208 R} as\nn\nR \u00d7{x|x \u2208 R}\u00d7{y|y \u2208 R}\u00d7{z|z = 0} \u2282 Rn \u00d7{x|x \u2208 R}\u00d7{y|y \u2208 R}\u00d7{z|z \u2208 R}.\ne (\u2282 Rn \u00d7 {x|x \u2208 R} \u00d7 {y|y \u2208 R} \u00d7 {z = 0} )\nWe consider whether A\nlifts into Rn \u00d7 {x|x \u2208 R} \u00d7 {y|y \u2208 R} \u00d7 {z|z \u2208 R}.\nWe consider whether A (\u2282 Rn \u00d7 {x \u2267 0} \u00d7 {y = 0} \u00d7 {z = 0})\nlifts into Rn \u00d7 {x \u2267 0} \u00d7 {y = 0} \u00d7 {z|z \u2208 R}.\nWe prove Claim 1. By the above result of [10] and Claim 1, Theorem 4.1\nholds.\ne be the spun immersed (n + 1)-sphere of an immersed n-sphere\nClaim 1. Let A\ne\nA. If A lifts, then A lifts.\n\nProof of Claim 1. Let E be an immersed m-sphere in Rm+1 \u00d7 {0}. Suppose\nE lifts into Rm+2 = Rm+1 \u00d7 R. Let K be a lift of E. Let Q be a compact\nn-submanifold \u2282 E. Suppose Q does not intersect with the singular point set of\nE. By using the partition of unity, we can suppose that E \u2229 K = Q.\ne \u2282 Rn \u00d7 {x|x \u2208 R} \u00d7 {y|y \u2208 R} \u00d7 {z|z \u2208 R}\nLet K\n\ne \u2282 Rn \u00d7 {x|x \u2208 R} \u00d7 {y|y \u2208 R} \u00d7 {z = 0}.

Then K0 \u2229 D is\nLet K0 = K\n\u2202D = \u2202K0 .\nThen K = K0 \u222a D is an n-submanifold \u2282 Rn \u00d7 {x \u2267 0} \u00d7 {y = 0} \u00d7 {z|z \u2208 R}.\nThen the projection of K is A. This completes the proof of Claim 1 and Theorem\n4.1.\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let n > 2. Let M be a closed manifold which can be immersed\ninto Rn+1 \u00d7 {0} and which can be embedded in Rn+1 \u00d7 R. Then there exists an\nimmersion f : M # Rn+1 \u00d7 {0} such that f (M ) does not lift into Rn+1 \u00d7 R.\nProof. Take an immersion g : M # Rn+1 \u00d7 {0}. Let A be an immersed nsphere which does not lift into Rn+1 \u00d7 R. Take a connected sum g(M )\u266fA in\nRn+1 \u00d7 {0}. If g(M )\u266fA lifts, then A lifts. Hence g(M )\u266fA does not lift. Take f\nso that f (M ) = g(M )\u266fA.\nAppendix. The proof of Theorem 2.4.\nWe review the definition of the Alexander polynomial \u2206K (t) for a (2k + 1)knot K. (See \u00a714 of [19]. ) Let A be a Seifert matrix for K. We define \u2206K (t) to\n10\n\n\fbe det(A \u2212 (\u22121)k A\u2032 ), where A\u2032 is the transposed matrix. Note that we identify\n\u2206K (t) with (\u22121)r ts \u2206K (t)(for any r, s \u2208 Z).\nTheorem 2.4 (known). Let K be a simple (2k + 1)-knot (k \u2265 1). Then the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent.\n(1) The Alexander polynomial of the simple (2k + 1)-knot K is trivial.\n(2) The simple (2k + 1)-knot K is trivial.\nNote. See the definition of simple knots for \u00a76 of [19].\nProof. (2) \u21d2 (1) is obvious. We prove (1) \u21d2 (2).\ne be the infinite cyclic covering of the complement X of the knot K. By\nLet X\ne \u223c\ne \u223c\n(1) we have: \u03c01 (X) \u223c\n= Z, \u03c01 (X)\n= 1, and Hi (X)\n= 0 (i > 0).\n\ne \u223c\nBy Hurewictz's theorem, we have: \u03c0i (X)\n= 0(i > 1).\nTherefore \u03c0i (X) \u223c\n= 0 (i > 1).\nThe following theorem is proved essentially in [17], [22], [24]. By this theorem,\nK is the trivial knot. This completes the proof.\nTheorem. ([17][22][24]) Let K1 be an n-knot (n \u2265 3) in S n+2 . Then K is\ntrivial if and only if the following conditions hold.\n(1)\u03c01 (S n+2 \u2212 K1 ) \u223c\n= Z.\nn+2\n\u223c\n(2)\u03c0i (S\n\u2212 K1 ) = 0 (i > 1).\nReferences\n[1]\n\nJ. W.
