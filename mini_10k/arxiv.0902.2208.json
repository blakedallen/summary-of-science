It is shown that the\nspin-transfer torque in asymmetric spin valves can vanish in non-collinear magnetic configurations,\nand such a non-standard behavior of the torque is generally associated with a non-monotonic angular dependence of the giant magnetoresistance, with a global minimum at a non-collinear magnetic\nconfiguration.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIntroduction: The macroscopic model of electronic\ntransport in magnetic metallic multilayers, developed by\nValet and Fert [1], is commonly used for interpretation of\nexperimental results on current-perpendicular-to-plane\n(CPP) giant magnetoresistance (GMR). The model includes several phenomenological parameters which can\nbe extracted from fitting experimental and theoretical results on resistance/magnetoresistance in collinear (parallel and antiparallel) magnetic configurations. The model\nis based on the assumption that the spin diffusion length\nis longer than mean free path, and the latter is smaller\nthan the layer thickness. Recently, Penn and Stiles [2]\nshowed that the Valet-Fert model is justified even for\nspin diffusion lengths comparable to the mean-free paths.\nMoreover, the model fits well to experimental results even\nwhen the mean free paths are comparable to the layer\nthicknesses.\nValidity of the model, however, can be justified only\nwhen it gives results which are in agreement with experiment not only in the collinear configurations (too many\nfitting parameters), but also in the full range of angles between magnetic moments of the layers' magnetizations.\nThis problem was not addressed yet. In a recent paper [3] the Valet-Fert model has been extended to noncollinear configurations, but only the angular variation of\nthe spin-transfer torque (STT) was analyzed there. The\nspin torque plays a crucial role in the phenomenon of\ncurrent-induced magnetic switching (CIMS). It turned\nout that both CPP-GMR and CIMS effects are correlated. Moreover, there are normal and inverse GMR and\nalso normal and inverse CIMS phenomena. Accordingly,\nfour different possibilities can be found in real systems\n[3]. Indeed, the normal and inverse CPP-GMR and/or\nCIMS have been demonstrated by manipulating the bulk\nand/or interface spin-asymmetry parameters [4].\nIt has been shown in Ref.[3] that the STT in asymmetric structures can vanish at a noncollinear configuration, which has a significant impact on the stability of\nmagnetic configuration. As a result, precessional states\nin zero magnetic field were predicted in the Co/Cu/Py\n\nnanopillars [5] and later experimentally confirmed [6].\nOne may naturally expect that the nonstandard behavior of STT may be associated with some anomalous angular behavior of the CPP-GMR. This problem is addressed here, and we show that a global minimum in\nresistance of asymmetric structures may occur in a noncollinear configuration. This non-monotonic behavior of\nthe resistance (and consequently also GMR) is generally\naccompanied by the non-standard angular dependence\nof STT. These two features seem to be characteristic of\nasymmetric systems in the diffuse transport regime, provided the system's parameters obey some conditions.\nModel of CPP-GMR: Within the diffusive approach\n[1, 3, 7], spatial dependence of the average electrochemical potential in a ferromagnetic (F) layer has the general form; \u03bc\u0304 = \u2212\u03b2 g + Cx + G, where the axis x is normal to the structure, and g is the spin accumulation,\ng = A exp(x/lsf ) + B exp(\u2212x/lsf ), with lsf being the spin\ndiffusion length. Similar formula also holds for normal\nmetal (N) layers, but with \u03b2 = 0. All the constants (A,\nB, C, and others) entering the general solution of the\ndiffusive equations in different layers can be determined\nfrom the corresponding boundary conditions [1, 3, 7].\nThe driving field can be then calculated as E(x) =\n(1/e)(\u2202 \u03bc\u0304/\u2202x) [1]. The presence of N/F interfaces gives\nrise to additional voltage drops due to spin accumulation\nin their vicinity.\nP The total voltage drop can be then written as \u2206V = i \u2206Vi , where \u2206Vi is the voltage drop in\nthe i-th layer of the spin valve (voltage drops at interface\nresistances will be included to the ferromagnetic layers).\nWhen the index i corresponds to a ferromagnetic layer,\n\u2206Vi = \u2206ViSI + \u2206Vispl . If, however, i corresponds to a\nnonmagnetic layer, \u2206Vi = \u2206ViSI + \u03c1i di I0 , where \u03c1i is\nthe bulk resistivity of the normal metal, di is the corresponding layer thickness, and I0 is the current density.\nThe voltage drops due to spin accumulation (in magnetic\nand nonmagnetic layers) read\n\u2206ViSI\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nx\u2208di\n\n[E(x) \u2212 E0 ] dx,\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nR(\u03b8) \u2212 RP\n.\nRAP \u2212 RP\n\n(2)\n\ne (E(x) \u2212 E0 ) [\u03bc eV/m]\n\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n(a)\n\nAP\nP\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx [nm]\n7\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nleft\nright\n\n6\n\nleft\nright\n\n20\n15\n\n5\n10\n4\n5\n\n3\n\ne \u2206VSI [meV]\n\nr(\u03b8) =\n\nhavior of the reduced GMR is more pronounced in spin\nvalves that are more asymmetric, see Fig.1(e).\n\ne \u2206VSI [meV]\n\nwhere the corresponding electric field E0 is taken far\nfrom the interface.

This has been attributed to the absorption of transverse spin accumulation in a non-collinear\nconfiguration, which reduces the resistance. Such absorption also gives rise to the STT acting on the F layer [12],\nwhich in asymmetric spin valves can exhibit an anomalous (non-standard) angular dependence [5, 6]. In systems with a non-standard STT, the transverse component of spin current (accumulation) at the active N/F\ninterface vanishes at a certain noncollinear configuration.\nThe presence of a GMR minimum in a noncollinear configuration can be thus related to the non-standard STT.\nThe STT appears due to absorption of the transverse\nspin current component j\u22a5 at the N/F interface [12], and\n\n\u03c4 =\n\n\u0001\n~ L\nR\n,\nj\u22a5 \u2212 j\u22a5\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the superscripts L and R denote the left and right\ninterface, respectively, associated with the F layer. Dependence of the STT can also be expressed explicitly in\nterms of the mixing conductances and spin accumulation\nat the normal-metal side of the N/F interface [3, 5]. The\nSTT consists generally of both in-plane and out-of-plane\ncomponents. Since the latter component is much smaller\nthan the former one (due to small imaginary part of the\nmixing conductances [13]), in the following discussion we\nwill consider only the in-plane component. In asymmetric spin valves, the proper choice of magnetic materials\nand/or layer thicknesses can result in vanishing STT at\na non-collinear magnetic configuration [5]. Such a nonstandard STT destabilizes both collinear configurations\nfor positive current and stabilizes both configurations for\nnegative current [3, 5]. The former case is of particular interest as the non-standard torque leads to currentinduced steady state oscillations in the absence of external magnetic field [5, 6]. In Fig.2(d) we show the angular\ndependence of STT in the Co(60)Cu(10)Co(8) spin valve\nexerted on the Co(60) (solid line) and Co(8) (dashed\nline). The STT acting on the Co(8) layer destabilizes\nP and stabilizes AP configuration, whereas the torque\nacting on the Co(60) vanishes at a non-collinear configuration and stabilizes both P and AP configurations. The\ntorques in Fig.2(d) correspond to the system indicated\nby the dot in Fig.2(a). This point is below the critical\nline, given by \u2202\u03c4 /\u2202\u03b8|\u03b8\u21920 = 0, which identifies the region\nwhere a non-standard STT acting on the Co(d1 ) layer appears. When the layer thicknesses are above the critical\nline, but still in the gray region, see the dot in Fig.2(b),\nthe torque acting on the particular F layer vanishes only\nfor the collinear configurations, as shown in Fig.2(e) for\nthe Py(1)Cu(10)Py(6) spin valve, but reduced GMR still\nexhibits a global minimum for a non-collinear configuration. Since the critical lines are close to the boundary of the non-monotonic angular GMR behavior (gray\nregions), the non-standard STT is correlated with the\nnon-monotonic angular variation of GMR.\nAt the critical angle \u03b8c , where the torque \u03c4 vanishes,\nthe transverse component of spin accumulation at the active interface disappears. In a general case, however, the\nangle \u03b8g between the spin moment of the F layer and spin\naccumulation vector at the normal-metal side of the N/F\ninterface is nonzero. Angular dependence of the STT\ncan be then expressed as a function of \u03b8g [3]. In Fig.3(a)\nand (b) the in-plane spin accumulation components at\nthe normal-metal side (in the spacer layer) at the left\nand right interfaces are shown for the spin valves considered in Figs 2(d)-(f). The components are expressed\nin local coordinate frames, where gz points along magnetization in the left F layer whereas gz\u2032 along magneti-\n\n\fSfrag replacements\n\n4\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n0.4 (a)\n\n1.2\n\n(b)\n\n0.8\n\n0\n-0.4\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n0.4\n\ngz\u2032 [meV]\n\ngz [meV]\n\nzation in the right F layer. The STT acting on Co(8) in\nthe Co(8)Cu(10)Py(8) spin valve exhibits regular behavior. Spin accumulation in the P configuration is positive\nand has comparable amplitudes in the vicinity of both\ninterfaces [see the dots on the dotted lines in Figs 3(a)\nand (b)] due to long spin-flip length in Cu (lsf \u2243 1 \u03bcm).\nWhen magnetization of the right layer rotates in the film\nplane, spin accumulation at the left interface roughly follows the net-spin of the Py(8) layer, and the angle \u03b8g\nis a monotonic function of \u03b8, see Fig.3(c). Figure 2(f)\nshows that STT exerted on the Py(8) layer vanishes in\na non-collinear configuration (\u03b8 = \u03b8c ), for which the gy\u2032\ncomponent also vanishes. At \u03b8 = \u03b8c one finds \u03b8g = 0.\nFor the Co(60)Cu(10)Co(8) system, STT acting on the\nCo(60) layer shows a non-standard behavior which is\nqualitatively similar to that for the Py(8) layer in the\nCo(8)Cu(10)Py(8) spin valve. Angular variation of STT\nfor the Py(1)Cu(10)Py(6) spin valve, shown in Fig.2(e),\nvanishes regularly in P and AP configurations, and \u03b8g is\na monotonic function of \u03b8.\n\n0\n\n-0.8\n-1.2\n-0.4 -0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n-0.4 -0.2\n\n0.2\n\n-0.4\n0.4\n\ngy\u2032 [meV]\n\ngy [meV]\n1\n\n\u2022\n0\n\n1\n\nIn conclusion, what stems from the above results is\na need for further experimental investigations, and that\nCo/Cu/Py system is a good candidate to test the theoretical predictions. This also could answer the question\nwhether the diffusive approach used to analyze CPPGMR in collinear configurations is well justified. To arrive at more convincing conclusions one also should correlate the results on GMR with those on STT.\nAcknowledgments: We thank A. Fert and V. Cros\nfor useful discussions.
