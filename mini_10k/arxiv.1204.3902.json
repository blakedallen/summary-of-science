Only a handful\nof experimental facts definitely involve particle physics\nbeyond the SM: neutrino oscillations (NOs), dark matter\n(DM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU),\nwhich is responsible for today's remnant baryon density\n\u03a9B . In Refs. [1, 2], it has been suggested that all of them\nmay be explained when the matter content of the SM\nis complemented by three right-handed neutrinos with\nmasses below the electroweak scale. Different authors\nhave investigated aspects of this idea [1\u201330]. However, to\ndate, it has not been verified that all requirements can\nbe fulfilled simultaneously. Claims made in Ref. [2] were\nbased on estimates and turn out to be premature from\ntoday's point of view due to constraints on the properties\nof DM sterile neutrinos from Ly\u03b1 and x-ray observations\nthat were not known at that time. These constraints\ncan be resolved if DM production is enhanced by a lepton asymmetry generated after sphaleron freeze-out. We\nperformed the first quantitative study of this process to\nidentify the range of sterile neutrino parameters that allow us to explain at once NO, DM, and the BAU. In this\nletter, we mainly present results; details are given in a\nmore detailed publication [31]. The centrepiece of our\nanalysis is the study of neutrino abundances in the early\nUniverse from hot big bang initial conditions to temperatures \u223c 50 MeV. We combine the results with bounds\nfrom direct searches for sterile neutrinos and constraints\nfrom big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which we reexamined in the face of recent data from neutrino experiments.\nWe verify for the first time that right-handed neutrinos\nwith experimentally accessible masses and mixings can\nsolve all these outstanding problems without any new\nphysics above the Fermi scale. We identify the experimentally interesting parameter region for future searches.\n\nThe Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (\u03bdMSM) - The\nscenario outlined above is realized within the \u03bdMSM, de-\n\nscribed by the Lagrangian\nL\u03bdMSM = LSM + i\u03bd\u0304R 6\u2202 \u03bdR \u2212 L\u0304L F \u03bdR \u03a6\u0303 \u2212 \u03bd\u0304R F \u2020 LL \u03a6\u0303\u2020\n1 c\n\u2020 c\n\u2212 (\u03bd \u0304R\nMM \u03bdR + \u03bd\u0304R MM\n\u03bdR ). (1)\n2\nWe have suppressed flavor and isospin indices. LSM is\nthe Lagrangian of the SM. F is a matrix of Yukawa couplings, and MM is a Majorana mass term for the righthanded neutrinos \u03bdR . LL = (\u03bdL , eL )T are the left-handed\nlepton doublets in the SM, and \u03a6 is the Higgs doublet.\nWe chose a basis where the charged lepton Yukawa couplings and MM are diagonal. The Lagrangian (1) is wellknown in the context of the seesaw mechanism [32\u201335].\nIn the \u03bdMSM, the eigenvalues of MM are below the electroweak scale [113]. This mass pattern is required to\nsimultaneously explain BAU and DM; at the same time,\nit avoids the \"hierarchy problem\" of the SM in the scaleinvariant version of the \u03bdMSM [36, 37]. The \u03bdMSM is\nmotivated by the principle of minimality; in comparison\nwith the SM, there is no modification of the gauge group,\nthe number of fermion families remains unchanged, and\nno new energy scale above the Fermi scale is introduced\n[6, 38].\nIn the \u03bdMSM, neutrino masses are generated from\nDirac masses mD = F v and Majorana masses MM by\nthe seesaw mechanism (v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value). In the limit MM \u226b mD , there are two\ndistinct sets of neutrino mass eigenstates. The block diagonalization of the full mass matrix yields mass matrices for active and sterile neutrinos m\u03bd = \u2212\u03b8MM \u03b8T and\nT T \u2217\nMN = MM + 21 (\u03b8\u2020 \u03b8MM + MM\n\u03b8 \u03b8 ), respectively. The\nactive mass eigenstates \u03bdi with masses mi are mainly\nmixings of the SM neutrinos \u03bdL,\u03b1 ; the remaining three\nsterile neutrinos NI with masses MI are mainly mixings\nof \u03bdR,I . Transitions between both are suppressed by the\n\u22121\nactive-sterile mixing matrix \u03b8 = mD MM\n.\nIn the following, we distinguish between three different\nscenarios. In scenario I, no physics beyond the \u03bdMSM is\nrequired to explain simultaneously NO, \u03a9DM and \u03a9B ,\nas outlined in the Introduction. One sterile neutrino\n(N1 ) constitutes all DM. This implies that (a) its mass\n\n\f2\n\n\u00c8\u039c\u0391 \u00c8 = 0\n\n10-10\n\n10-12\n\n10-14\n\nExcluded by X-ray observations\n\nExcluded by phase space analysis\n\n10-8\n\nS\u0391 sin2 H2\u0398\u03911 L\n\nand mixing are consistent with astrophysical constraints\nand (b) thermal production can account for the observed\n\u03a9DM . The other two (N2,3 ) produce the BAU and generate active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism.\nIn scenario II, the roles of the NI are the same, but we\ndrop requirement (b), i.e., we assume that DM is made\nof N1 , that was produced by some unspecified mechanism. In scenario III, we consider the \u03bdMSM as a theory\nof baryogenesis only and drop any constraints related to\nDM.\nTo explain the observed DM density \u03a9DM in scenarios I and II, the lifetime of N1 must be larger than the\nage of the Universe. Its decay leaves a distinct x-ray line\nof energy M1 /2 that can be searched for [39, 40] with xray satellites. Combining x-ray observations with simulations of structure formation and phase space arguments,\nit was found that N1 mass and mixing are constrained\nto 1 keV< M1 . 50 keV and 10\u221213 . sin2 (2\u03b8\u03b11 ) . 10\u22127\n[6]. The seesaw relation mi \u223c \u2212\u03b8MM \u03b8T implies that the\ncoupling of N1 is too small to contribute significantly to\nthe active neutrino mass matrix, and one active neutrino\nis effectively massless in the \u03bdMSM [1, 15].\nIn scenario I, N1 must be produced thermally in the\nearly Universe due to active-sterile mixing [41]. In the\nabsence of lepton asymmetries, \u03bc\u03b1 = 0, the resulting\nspectrum was found in [23]. For \u03bc\u03b1 6= 0, the N1 dispersion relation in the primordial plasma is modified,\nwhich results in a resonantly amplified N1 production\n[3, 4, 42, 43]. This adds a nonthermal, colder component to the N1 momentum distribution. x-ray observations, structure formation simulations, and Ly\u03b1 forest\ndata [6, 44\u201346] suggest that if \u03bc\u03b1 = 0, N1 cannot account\nfor the observed DM (see figure 1). Then the presence\nof considerable lepton asymmetries |\u03bc\u03b1 | & 8 * 10\u22126 [4]\nbecomes a necessary condition for sterile neutrino DM\nproduction.\nThe thermal history of the universe in the \u03bdMSM differs from that of the SM, as new interactions generate\nlepton asymmetries \u03bc\u03b1 6= 0 during production, oscillations, freeze-out, and decay of NI , when all Sakharov\nconditions [52] are fulfilled. No significant lepton asymmetries or NI abundances are created during reheating\nafter inflation due to the smallness of F [5]. Baryogenesis occurs via sterile neutrino oscillations during their\nthermal production [2, 53] in processes as tt\u0304 \u2192 \u03bdN at\nT & Tsph , where the temperature of sphaleron freeze-out\nis Tsph \u223c 140 GeV for a Higgs mass mH = 126 GeV. Although the total lepton number violation is suppressed by\nMI /T \u226a 1, opposite sign asymmetries are created in the\nsterile and active flavors. The latter are partly converted\ninto a BAU by sphaleron processes [54]. To explain the\nobserved BAU [55], a lepton asymmetry \u03bc\u03b1 \u223c 10\u221210\nis required at the sphaleron freeze-out (T \u223c Tsph ). In\nscenarios I and II, only N2,3 are produced in significant\namounts at T & Tsph , as the N1 coupling is constrained\nto be tiny. Soon after, they reach equilibrium and \u03bc\u03b1\nare washed out. They exit equilibrium when ll\u0304 \u2192 \u03bdN\nscatterings freeze out (T \u223c few GeV) and decay subse-\n\n1\n\n\u00c8\u039c\u0391 \u00c8 = 1.24 10-4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\nM1 @keVD\n\nFIG. 1: Different constraints on N1 mass and mixing in scenario I. The blue region is excluded by x-ray observations, the\ndark gray region M1 < 1 keV by the Tremaine-Gunn bound\n[47\u201349]. For points on the upper solid black line, the observed\n\u03a9DM is produced for \u03bc\u03b1 = 0 [4]; points on the lower solid black\nline give the correct \u03a9DM for |\u03bc\u03b1 | = 1.24 * 10\u22124 , the maximal\nasymmetry we found at T = 100 MeV. The region between\nthese lines is accessible for 0 \u2264 |\u03bc\u03b1 | \u2264 1.24 * 10\u22124 . Observations of the matter distribution in the Universe constrain\nthe DM free streaming length. Without resonant production\n(\u03bc\u03b1 = 0), this implies that M1 > 8 keV [44], which excludes\nthe upper black curve and makes resonant production necessary. Combining both production mechanisms (|\u03bc\u03b1 | & 10\u22125 ),\nthis bound relaxes to M1 > 2 keV [44]. However, we do not\ndisplay it here because it depends on \u03bc\u03b1 in a complicated way\nand the calculation currently includes considerable uncertainties [44], cf. also [50, 51].\n\nquently (T . 1 GeV). These nonequilibrium processes\ncreate new lepton asymmetries at a late time. The DM\nproduction in scenario I is amplified resonantly at temperatures around T \u223c 100 MeV due to the presence of\nthese asymmetries.\nWe first focus on scenario I. The two requirements (i)\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u223c 10\u221210 at T \u223c Tsph (for BAU) and (ii) |\u03bc\u03b1 | & 8*10\u22126\nat T \u223c 100 MeV (for DM) can be used to constrain the\nproperties of sterile neutrinos. Since N1 does not contribute to high and low temperature leptogenesis, this\ncan be done in an effective theory with two sterile neutrinos, N2,3 . This theory contains 11 new parameters in\naddition to the SM. They can be chosen as two active\nneutrino masses mi and three mixing angles, a Dirac and\na Majorana phase, two Majorana masses in MM and one\nextra complex parameter, associated with CP-violation\nin the sterile sector.\nCondition (ii) implies much stronger constraints than\n(i), so we only consider it in what follows. For the allowed Yukawa couplings, the asymmetry (ii) can only\nbe generated if the CP-violating terms are resonantly\namplified by a mass degeneracy between M2,3 \u2243 M\n[3]. The asymmetry generation is most efficient for\n\u0393N \u223c H \u223c \u03c9, where \u0393N is the thermal NI width, H\nis the Hubble rate, and \u03c9 is the frequency of N2,3 oscillations. It is related to the physical mass splitting \u03b4M\n\n\f3\nat the time of low-temperature lepton asymmetry generation via \u03c9 \u223c M \u03b4M/T if M . T or simply \u03c9 = \u03b4M\nif T . M . Due to the interplay of thermal, Dirac\nand Majorana masses, \u03b4M is a complicated function of\nMM = diag(M \u2212 \u2206M/2, M + \u2206M/2), F and T [31].\nThe required \u03b4M should be smaller than 10\u22126 eV for\nM = 2 GeV. Since this is much smaller than active neutrino masses, two unknown parameters of the \u03bdMSM are\nalmost fixed by this constraint. For M \u223c 2 GeV, the\nsplitting of the Majorana masses \u2206M must be equal\nwith one part in 104 \u2212 106 to the mass difference of\nthe active neutrinos [7]. In addition, the combination\n|Re(m\u2020D mD )23 |/M must be smaller than active neutrino\nmasses by \u223c 4 \u2212 6 orders of magnitude [31]. These tunings ensure that the Higgs induced contribution to \u03b4M\ncancels the Majorana term \u2206M . Scenario I can only be\nrealized within the constrained \u03bdMSM defined by these\ntunings. In the constrained \u03bdMSM, 7 out of 11 parameters are almost fixed either by experimental data or by\nthe requirement (ii). The remaining four parameters are\nthe common mass M of N2,3 , two CP-violating phases\nin the active neutrino mass matrix, and yet one extra\nCP-violating parameter in the sterile neutrino sector.\n\nThe high degree of tuning \u03b4M/M . 10\u221213 in scenario\nI is not understood theoretically. Some speculations can\nbe found in [3, 7, 11, 56]. However, the origin of this fine\ntuning plays no role for the present work. Scenario II only\nrequires the weaker condition (i) that can be achieved\nby a much weaker tuning in \u2206M/M \u223c 10\u22123 [21]. In\nscenario III, all three sterile neutrinos can participate\nin baryogenesis. Due to the additional sources of CP\nviolation, there is no need for a mass degeneracy [29].\nNote that this also implies that no degeneracy is needed\nin scenario II if more than three fields \u03bdR,I are added to\nthe SM.\n\nMethod and Results. - The rates of interaction of the\nSM fields exceed those of sterile neutrinos NI and the rate\nof the Universe expansion. Therefore, the SM sector can\nbe described by four numbers: the temperature T and\nthe asymmetries \u03bc\u03b1 . The effect of the NI on the time\nevolution of temperature and on the effective number of\ndegrees of freedom is negligible. The state of NI can be\ndescribed by matrices of density \u03c1N and \u03c1N\u0304 , commonly\nused in neutrino physics [57], which allow us to incorporate coherences and oscillations between the two flavors\nand are probably sufficient for our purpose, cf. [29, 57\u2013\n76]. The diagonal elements of the 2 \u00d7 2 matrices \u03c1N and\n\u03c1N\u0304 are the abundances of particles and antiparticles, respectively, defined as the helicity states of the Majorana\nfields NI . The time evolution of neutrino abundances is\n\ngoverned by the kinetic equations\nd\u03c1N\ni\ni\n= [H, \u03c1N ] \u2212 {\u0393N , \u03c1N \u2212 \u03c1eq } + \u03bc\u03b1 \u0393\u0303\u03b1\nN , (2)\ndT\n2\n2\ni\ni\nd\u03c1\ni N\u0304 = [H \u2217 , \u03c1N\u0304 ] \u2212 {\u0393\u2217N , \u03c1N\u0304 \u2212 \u03c1eq } \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 \u0393\u0303\u03b1\u2217\nN , (3)\ndT\n2\n2\nh\ni\nd\u03bc\u03b1\n\u03b1\neq\n= \u2212i\u0393\u03b1\ni\nL \u03bc\u03b1 + itr \u0393\u0303L (\u03c1N \u2212 \u03c1 )\ndT\ni\nh\neq\n(4)\n\u2212itr \u0393\u0303\u03b1\u2217\nL (\u03c1N\u0304 \u2212 \u03c1 ) .\ni\n\nHere, \u03c1eq is the equilibrium density matrix, H is the dispersive part of the finite temperature effective NI Hamil\u03b1\ntonian, and \u0393N , \u0393\u03b1\nL and \u0393\u0303 L are rates that are responsible for dissipative effects, which are calculated from\nthermal field theory [31]. They describe sterile neutrino\nproduction, oscillations, freeze-out and decay. Due to\nthe various involved time scales, the dependence of the\nasymmetries on model parameters can only be estimated\nunder certain assumptions [3, 29, 60, 62] that are too\nsimplifying for a quantitative study.\nWe focussed on scenarios I and II. The most important properties of N2,3 from an experimental viewpoint\nare their masses M2,3 \u2243 M and mixings with active neutrinos. The latter can be parameterized by the quantity U 2 \u2261 tr(\u03b8\u2020 \u03b8). In order to identify the range of M\nand U 2 consistent with conditions (i) and (ii), we calculated the lepton asymmetries from T \u226b Tsph down to\nT = 100 MeV as a function of unknown parameters identified above and varied the others within admitted 1\u03c3\nuncertainties.\nFixing all known neutrino parameters to the values\ngiven in [77][114], we first identified the Dirac and Majorana phases that maximize the produced asymmetries\nat T = Tsph and T = 100 MeV in different regions in\nthe parameter space. We then scanned for all possible\nvalues of the remaining parameters. We performed the\nanalysis several times with different grids. This allows us\nto identify the parameter regions where condition (i) or\n(ii) or both can be fulfilled. They correspond to sterile\nneutrino properties for which the \u03bdMSM can, along with\nNOs, explain the observed \u03a9B , \u03a9DM or both. We studied\nthe mass range 1 MeV \u2264 M \u2264 10 GeV; for bigger masses\nit is very unlikely that N2,3 can be found experimentally\nin the near future.\nThe \u03bdMSM parameter space is also constrained by direct searches for sterile neutrinos [17, 26, 78\u201390]. Here,\nwe focus on the most relevant bounds, coming from the\nNuTeV [84], CHARM [91] and CERN PS191 [82, 83] experiments. The experimental constraints on active-sterile\nmixing have recently been interpreted in the context of\nthe seesaw Lagrangian (1) [25, 26], cf. also [78, 79]. We\nused bounds on \u03b8 imposed by the negative results of\n[82, 84, 91\u201396], provided by the authors of [26], as input\nand numerically scanned the space of unknown model parameters to identify all combinations of M and U 2 compatible with experiment.\nFinally, it is a necessary requirement that N2,3 have decayed sufficiently long before BBN that their decay prod-\n\n\f4\n\nCHARM\n10-6\n\nNuTeV\nPS\n\n1\n\nBAU\n\nN\nBB\n\nU2\n\n19\n\n10-8\n\nBAU\nDM\n10-10\n\nSeesaw\n\n10-12\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\nM @GeVD\nNuTeV\n-6\n\nPS\n\nU2\n\n19\n\nBAU\n\n1\n\nBB\n\n10-8\n\nBAU\n\nN\nDM\n\nSeesaw\n\n10-10\n\n10-12\n\nSolving Eqs. (2)-(4) allows us to determine the maximal lepton asymmetry generated in the \u03bdMSM. Its value\nimposes a lower bound on the mixing of the DM candidate N1 in scenario I. Our result for M < 10 GeV, shown\nin Fig. 1 along with astrophysical bounds, is about 1 order of magnitude larger than previous estimates [3]. This\nconsiderably eases the ultimate goal of x-ray searches for\nN1 .\n\nCHARM\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n5.0\n\nMaki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix. The masses of N2,3 are\ncorrespondingly bounded from below by 1.3 and 2.0 GeV\nfor the inverted and normal hierarchies. For the lower\nmass range, sterile neutrinos can be created in decays of\nbeauty and charmed mesons, which is crucial for experimental searches [17]. The two larger eigenvalues of F \u2020 F\ncan vary between \u223c 10\u221212 and \u223c 10\u221217 to simultaneously explain \u03a9B and \u03a9DM . Typical values correspond\nto Yukawa couplings of N2,3 of the order 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22127 ,\nsmaller than the electron Yukawa by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The N1 Yukawa couplings are required to be of\nthe order 10\u221211 \u2212 10\u221212 , smaller than those of N2,3 by\n5 orders of magnitude, which is comparable to the ratio\nbetween down and top quark Yukawa couplings.\n\n10.0\n\nM @GeVD\n\nFIG. 2: Constraints on N2,3 masses M2,3 \u2243 M and mixing\nU 2 \u2261 tr(\u03b8\u2020 \u03b8) in scenarios I (red line) and II (blue line) for\nnormal (upper panel) and inverted (lower panel) hierarchy\nof neutrino masses. In the regions within the blue and red\nlines, no physics beyond the \u03bdMSM is needed to explain the\nobserved \u03a9B and \u03a9DM , respectively.\n\nucts do not affect the abundances of light elements. We\nestimate the inverse N2,3 lifetime \u03c4 by as \u03c4 \u22121 \u2243 12 tr\u0393N\nat T = 1 MeV. This is justified as N2,3 oscillate rapidly\naround the time of BBN. We varied all free parameters\nto identify the region in the M -U 2 plane consistent with\nthe condition \u03c4 < 0.1s.\nOur results are summarized in Figs. 1 and 2. Figure 2 shows constraints on N2,3 mass and mixing coming\nfrom experiments (green lines), BBN (dashed black line),\nneutrino oscillations experiments (black dashed line that\nis labeled seesaw), and cosmology. Scenario II can be\nrealized in the region between the blue lines that are labeled BAU. The difference to the result found in [21] is\nmainly due to \u03b813 6= 0. The region within the red line\nallows us to produce the observed \u03a9DM . It has been determined for the first time in this work. Although the\nvalues for the CP-violating phases and \u2206M that maximize the efficiency of baryogenesis and DM production\nare very different, the region in which \u03a9B and \u03a9DM can\nbe explained simultaneously (scenario I) almost coincides\nwith the area inside the red line. In most of the parameter\nspace, the relevant CP-violation comes mainly from the\nsterile sector and not from the phases in the Pontecorvo-\n\nConclusion - We performed the first complete systematic study of the \u03bdMSM parameter space, bringing together cosmological, astrophysical and experimental constraints. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1)\nRight-handed neutrinos alone can be the common origin\nof neutrino oscillations, DM and the BAU; (2) for a range\nof model parameters, these particles can be found using\npresent day experimental and observational techniques.\nThe DM candidate N1 can be searched for astrophysically, using high resolution x-ray spectrometers to look\nfor the emission line from its decay in DM dense regions.\nThe seesaw partners N2,3 can either be discovered as\nmissing energy in the decay of mesons or by creating\nthem in a beam-dump experiment and looking for their\ndecay in a nearby detector [17]. Depending on the\nmass M , different facilities could be used or upgraded\nfor this search, including the CERN SPS beam and\nNA62 experiment, LHCb, MINOS, J-PARC or LBNE at\nFNAL. The necessary experiments are challenging due\nto strong constraints on the mixing angle U 2 coming\nfrom cosmology.\nAcknowledgements - We are grateful to M.
