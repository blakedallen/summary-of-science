A quantitative investigation of the\neffect is made on the CP asymmetry in future neutrino factory experiments.\n\nLeptonic CP violation (CPV) is one of the main challenges in future long baseline (LBL) neutrino\noscillation experiments [1], where more accurate measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters are\nanticipated. However, since the neutrino beam travels a long path through the Earth, the MSW matter effect\n[2] can mimic a non-vanishing CP phase and makes it non-trivial to extract the intrinsic CP phase. Therefore,\na thorough quantitative understanding of the matter effect and its possible uncertainties is necessary before\nan accurate account of the CPV effect can be achieved.\nThe critical quantity in discerning the matter effect is the value of the Earth matter density as a function\nof the baseline. A number of approaches have been suggested on using different Earth density profiles of the\nEarth for the electron number density (DEN). In these works, DEN is taken either as a distance-averaging\neffective constant [3], an adiabatic approximation profile [4], mantle-core-mantle layers approximation [5],\nmulti-step functions [6], or the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM) [7]. We refer to Ref. [8] for a\nreview of some of the available Earth density models. It is clear from these works that the analysis of the\nleptonic CPV will depend on the Earth density model adopted to analyze the experimental data.\nFrom the geophysics point of view, a density model is understood to be an approximation of the Earth\nand has its inherent uncertainties. For a brief discussion on the uncertainty of DEN, we refer to Refs. [9] and\n[5]. Detailed discussions can be found in geophysics review[10, 11, 12]. As to PREM, significant deviations\nfrom PREM due to local variation have been documented[13] and averaged per spherical shell with thickness\nof 100 Km, its precision is roughly 5%.\nInstead of examining quantitatively all the schemes of the Earth density to find out the preferred density\nscheme to use, we would like to raise and attempt to provide at least a partial answer to the following basic\nquestions: What is the effect of uncertainties in the Earth matter density on the measurement of CPV? Can\nthe effect be so severe that it demands a more accurate knowledge of the Earth density before a reliable CP\nphase can be extracted in LBL experiments?\nWe propose in this paper to estimate the error due to the uncertainty in the Earth matter density as\nthe variance of a CP odd oscillation probability. As described below the procedure in making the estimate\nis a weighted average over the whole sample space of possible Earth density profiles. We first introduce\na local variance function \u03c3(x) to characterize the density uncertainties at each point of the Earth along a\ngiven baseline. With the variance function we sample the earth density profiles, then construct an averaging\nprocess to calculate the deviation of a physical quantity from its mean value. The probability of the various\nDEN examples is taken as a logarithmic distribution suitable for non-negative quantities, although other\nstatistics approach may be used.\n\u2217 shanly@ihep.ac.cn\n\n1\n\n\fWe begin the formulation with the flavor Hamiltonian that governs the neutrino propagation in matter.\nOmitting terms that leads to only a common phase to all flavor states, we have, in the scheme of three flavors\nof neutrinos,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u221a\nm\n0\n0\n2GF Ne (x) 0 0\nU \uf8ed 1\n0 m22 0 \uf8f8 U \u2020 + \uf8ed\n(1)\nH[\u03b4cp , Ne (x)] =\n0\n0 0 \uf8f8,\n2E\u03bd\n2\n0\n0 m3\n0\n0 0\n\nwhere E\u03bd is the energy of the neutrino, GF the Fermi constant, and mj , j=1, 2, 3 are the neutrino mass\neigenvalues. U is the three-neutrino mixing matrix in the basis where the charged leptons are diagonalized [14,\n15] and \u03b4cp is the CPV phase appearing in the mixing matrix. Ne (x) is the DEN function that determines\nthe matter effect. For the antineutrino Ne (x) is replaced by \u2212Ne (x) and U by its complex conjugated which\nis equivalent to replacing \u03b4 by \u2212\u03b4. The \u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 oscillation probability and that for their anti-particles can\nbe written succinctly to exhibit the DEN dependence as\nP\u03b1\u03b2\nP\u1fb1\u03b2\u0304\n\n\u2261 P\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L, E, \u03b4cp , Ne (x)) =\n\n\u0010\n\nT exp \u2212 i\n\nZ\n\n\u2261 P\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u0304\u03b2 (L, E, \u03b4cp , Ne (x)) =\n\n\u0010\n\nT exp \u2212 i\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n,\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u0001\u0011\nH[\u03b4cp , Ne (x)]dx\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\u0001\u0011\nH[\u2212\u03b4cp , \u2212Ne (x)]dx\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T denotes a propagation path-ordering product [16]. For numerical implementation we follow the\nusual approach of numerically integrating the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nAlthough EDN is a critical factor in the analysis of the long baseline oscillation data, what is usually\navailable is an averaged Earth density function N\u0302e (x) such as the widely used PREM model. In the following\nwe study the effect of variations from the average value. Let us define the average density N\u0302e (x) and its\nuncertainties given by the variance function \u03c3(x),\nZ\nq\nN\u0302e (x) =< Ne (x) >= [DNe ]Ne (x)F [Ne (x)], < \u03c3(x) >= < Ne2 (x) > \u2212< Ne (x) >2 ,\n(3)\nwhere F [Ne (x)][DNe ] is the probability of obtaining the DEN Ne (x) in the neighborhood x, which will be\ndefined in more detail later. The oscillation probability can be defined as an average over all the possible\nDEN profiles around N\u0302e (x). The appropriate framework for such a statistical expectation is the functional\nintegral in which the Earth density profiles span a functional space that contains all possible variations of\nthe earth densities allowed within the given variance. We write,\nZ\n< P\u03b1\u03b2 >= [DNe ]P\u03b1\u03b2 F [Ne (x)].\n(4)\nIn geophysics, a uniform random sampling in a broad space of the Earth matter density are used to\ngenerate the matter density models [17, 18]. The density function generated in this way is further constrained\nby testing against two important sets of observational data. One is the mass and moment of inertia of the\nEarth, and the other the normal modes of the free oscillation of the Earth. In general the samples remained\napproach a Gaussian-like statistics rather than a uniform one, which together with the fact that the Earth\nmatter density is always positive suggest to us to recast it into a logarithmic normal distribution for the\nprobability density[19],\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n1\n\u221a\nexp \u2212 ln2 Ne (x)/N0 (x) / 2s2 (x)\nF [Ne (x), x] =\nNe (x) 2\u03c0s(x)\nq\n\u0001\n\u0001\ns(x) = ln 1 + r2 (x) , N0 (x) = N\u0302e (x)exp \u2212 s2 (x)/2\n(5)\nwhere r(x) = \u03c3(x)/N\u0302e (x) parameterizes the uncertainty in DEN in terms of the ratio of local variance and\nthe local mean value of the Earth's density.\nThe logarithmic distribution is not a symmetric distribution for arbitrary \u03c3. However, it is close to the\nGaussian distribution for \u03c3 small in comparison with N\u0302e . In Fig. 1 we plot the logarithmic and Gaussian\ndistributions for r = 5%, 50% respectively with N\u0302e (x) given by PREM. We see that the logarithmic distributions Ne (x) is always positive and the difference between the Gaussian and the logarithmic distributions\nis very small in the case of r = 5% . In Fig.2, we plot the density profile, from which we see that the PREM\n2\n\n\fdenoted by the thick solid line is a average of the geophysical density samples shown by the oscillating thin\nlines.\nWith the inclusion of uncertainties in DEN, we can now estimate the uncertainty in the neutrino oscillation probability by computing the variance of the oscillation probability,\nsZ\nq\n2\n2\n\u03b4P\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 < (P\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 < P\u03b1\u03b2 >) > =\n(P\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 < P\u03b1\u03b2 >) F [Ne (x)][DNe ].\n(6)\nThe variance \u03b4P\u03b1\u03b2 leads to an uncertainty in the number of observed charged leptons. Since the charged\nlepton events are usually divided into energy bins, we define the variance of event number in a bin as,\n\u03b4N\u03b2 (E, L) = \u03c6\u03bd\u03b1 (E, L)\u03b4P\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3\u03b2 (E)\u2206E,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03bd\u03b1 (E, L) is the neutrino beam flux spectrum of flavor \u03b1, \u03c3\u03b2 (E) is the charged current cross section\nof neutrino of flavor \u03b2, and \u2206E is the bin size.\nTo measure the CPV effect, the difference between event rates of opposite charged leptons is usually\nconsidered,\nNcp (E, L, \u03b4cp )\n\n\u2261 N\u03b2 \u2212 N\u03b2\u0304 = [\u03c6\u03bd\u03b1 (E, L)P\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3\u03b2 (E) \u2212 \u03c6\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 (E, L)P\u1fb1\u03b2\u0304 \u03c3\u03b2\u0304 (E)]\u2206E\n\nCP\n(\u03b4cp )\u03c3\u03b2 (E)\u2206E,\n= \u03c6\u03bd\u03b1 (E, L)D\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the CP-odd difference [20, 3, 4] is given by,\nCP\nD\u03b1\u03b2\n(\u03b4cp ) \u2261 P\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L, E, \u03b4cp ) \u2212 P\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u0304\u03b2 (L, E, \u03b4cp ).\n\n(9)\n\nIn our numerical calculations, we have assumed that the neutrino and anti-neutrino beams have the same\nflux spectrum and the mass of the detector for the anti-neutrino is twice of that of the neutrino so as to\ncompensate the difference in the neutrino and anti-neutrino charged-current cross sections.\nNow the error from the uncertainty of DEN is estimated as the standard deviation,\nq\n2\nCP\n< [P\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 P\u1fb1\u03b2\u0304 \u2212 < P\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 P\u1fb1\u03b2\u0304 >] >\n\u03b4D\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2261\nq\n2\n2\n=\n(10)\n[\u03b4P\u03b1\u03b2 ] + [\u03b4P\u1fb1\u03b2\u0304 ] .\nUnless this uncertainty is under control it will be difficult to extract the CP phase. It may even be difficult\nto establish the CPV effect if the fluctuation caused by the uncertainty of the matter density is not much\nsmaller than the typical CP asymmetry given by,\nCP\n\u2261 D\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b4cp ) \u2212 D\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b4cp = 0).\n\u2206D\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(11)\n\nNote that we can also work with the normalized conventional CP asymmetry,\nsZ\nCP\nD\n\u03b1\u03b2\nAcp =\n, \u03b4Acp =\n(Acp \u2212 < Acp >)2 F [Ne (x)][DNe ],\nP\u03b1\u03b2 + P\u1fb1\u03b2\u0304\n\n(12)\n\nwhich should provide the same information.\nWe evaluate Eqs. (4) and (6) numerically using a method similar to that of the lattice gauge theory. The\nneutrino path is discretized into I one-dimensional cells where I is a sufficiently large integer. In each of the\ni-th cell, the DEN function Ne (xi ) has an independent logarithm normal distribution with its local variance\n\u03c3(xi ). Then the estimators of the mean and the deviation can be recasted respectively into the following\nforms,\nCP\n< D\u03b1\u03b2\n>\n\n=\n\n=\n\nCP\n\u03b4D\u03b1\u03b2\n\n=\n\nlim\n\nI\u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\nCP\nD\u03b1\u03b2\n[{\u2206m2 , \u03b8; \u03b4cp }; {Ne (x1 ), ...Ne (xi ), ...Ne (xI )}]\n\nlim K \u22121\n\nK\u2192\u221e\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\nD\u0303k [{\u2206m2 , \u03b8, \u03b4cp }; {Ne }k ]\n\u22121\n\n{ lim (K \u2212 1)\nK\u2192\u221e\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\nI\nY\n\ni=1\n\nF [Ne (xi ), xi ]\n\ndNe (xi )\n\u221a\nNe (xi ) 2\u03c0s(xi )\n(13)\n\n1/2\n\n[D\u0303k \u2212 <\n\nCP\nD\u03b1\u03b2\n\n2\n\n>] }\n3\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere we have replaced the functional integration over the DEN by a sum over K arrays, {Ne }k , k = 1, 2, ...K,\nCP\nand D\u0303k is the value of the difference D\u03b1\u03b2\nover the k-th density function {Ne }k . The array, {Ne }k which\nconsists of density function Ne (x1 ), ...Ne (xi )...Ne (xI ) is generated from PREM weighted with a Gausianlike logarithm deviation. Of course, other specific Earth density models can be used. We have checked\nnumerically that Eqs. (13) and (14) are convergent and stable.\nGeophysically, to obtain the density profile, the earth is discretized into hexahedrons ( elementary volume\nin spheroidal coordinates ), then Earth density is defined on the nodes and solved as an inverse problem.\nGenerally there exists a length scale of the hexahedrons, which typically is order of 100 Km[10, 19, 21]. So\nwe take I to be the order of L/100Km in our calculation. Furthermore since the series in Eqs. (13) and (14)\nconverges very rapidly due to the Gaussian-like distribution of Eq. (5), for the convenience of the calculation\nwe identify K with the number of beam neutrinos in the individual bins, i.e.,\nK = K(E, L) = \u03c6\u03bd\u03b1 (E, L)\u03c3\u03b1 (E)\u2206E.\n\n(15)\n\nHaving constructed all the needed ingredients, we can now investigate the error in CPV due the uncertainty of matter density. In the numerical calculation we take the baseline 2900 km for illustration. This\nbaseline has been widely used for the study of CP violation at neutrino factories. We take a 20 GeV high\nperformance neutrino factory, which delivers 1021 working muons per year to a 50 kiloton detector. Since\nthe path of the 2900 km baseline can go as deep as 160 km into the Earth and this will reach part of the low\nvelocity zone, the uncertainty of the PREM can be sizable. In the numerical calculation, we take r(x) = 5%\nand the lattice size to be 200 km.\nWe adopt the large mixing angle (LMA) scenario [22] for the solar neutrino puzzle and take the following\ntypical set of mixing parameters,\n\u2206m2sol = 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\n\u2206m2atm = 3.55 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b812 = 0.3,\n\nsin2 2\u03b823 = 0.99 .\n\n(16)\n\nWe also take the typical value sin2 \u03b813 = 0.08.\nNow we present the numerical results. First, we study the extend to which the matter effect will mimic\nthe CPV effect. In Fig.3, we plot Ncp as a function of the neutrino energy. The dashed line is given by\n\u03b4cp = 0 with the error bars for an 5% uncertainty in PREM. So at this baseline the uncertainty caused\nby that of the matter density seems to be partially controllable. To see this more clearly and to estimate\nthe range of the uncertainty, we show in Fig. 4 the following cases: dashed curve for \u03b4cp = 90\u25e6 with 5%\nuncertainty in PREM, dotted and solid curves respectively for \u03b4cp = 54\u25e6 and \u03b4cp = 0 without uncertainty in\nPREM. It is clear that \u03b4cp = 90\u25e6 can be easily distinguished from \u03b4cp = 0. However, there is an large error\nin extracting the CP phase that is about 36\u25e6 .\nThe uncertainty increases with the baseline because of the accumulation of the matter effect. In Fig. 5 we\nplot Ncp vs the neutrino energy for a 12000 Km baseline. We consider again a neutrino factory which delivers\n1021 working muons per year but at 50 GeV to increase the statistics. One can see that the uncertainty is\nlarge and it can no longer to distinguish \u03b4cp = 90\u25e6 from \u03b4cp = 0\u25e6 . So in order to have sensitivities for the\nCP measurement at this distance, the accuracy in DEN has to be much better than 5%.\nWe note that the effect of uncertainties in the Earth density have also been examined in Ref. [23, 24].\nHowever the uncertainty has been fixed at the maximum value, i.e., Ne (x) = (1 \u00b1 r\u2032 )N\u0302e (x) where N\u0302e (x)\nis also given by PREM. As a comparison, we show in Fig. 5, together with our results, the constant\nuncertainties with r\u2032 = 5% (dot-dashed and dashed lines). In our language this fixed-value distribution\nfunction is represented by a delta function. So we think it overestimates the effects of the uncertainty of the\nEarth density.\nTo conclude, we have considered in some details the issue of extract the information of the CPV effect\nin the presence of uncertainties in the Earth matter density in high precision measurements anticipated in\nfuture LBL neutrino experiments. We have developed a path integral formulation to estimate the fluctuation\naround the statistical mean. We have also presented a numerical implement of the formulation and applied\nit to assess the effectiveness in the determination of the CP phase.\nWe thank Yi-Fang Wang for discussions.
