The Montonen-Olive duality puts strong constraints on the OPE\nand in the case G = SU (2) completely determines it.

We verify some of these predictions.\nWe also make some general observations about higher categories and\ndefects in Topological Field Theories.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn important property of Yang-Mills theory is that it contains Wilson loop\noperators labeled by irreducible representations of the gauge group G [1].\nTheir product is controlled by the representation ring of G and therefore\ndetermines G uniquely. The work of Goddard, Nuyts, and Olive [2] on magnetic sources can be reinterpreted [3] as saying that Yang-Mills theory admits\nanother class of loop operators labeled by irreducible representations of the\nLanglands-dual group L G. Such operators are called 't Hooft loop operators.\nThe Montonen-Olive duality conjecture [4] states that N = 4 super-YangMills theory with gauge group G is isomorphic to N = 4 super-Yang-Mills\ntheory with gauge group L G, and this isomorphism exchanges Wilson and 't\nHooft loop operators. This conjecture therefore predicts that the product of\n't Hooft loop operators is controlled by the representation ring of L G.\nThis implication of the Montonen-Olive conjecture has been verified in\n[5] for suitably supersymmetrized versions of 't Hooft loops. The idea is to\ntwist N = 4 SYM theory into a 4d Topological Field Theory (TFT), so that\neither Wilson or 't Hooft loop operators become topological observables.\nOne can show then that the product of loop operators is independent of\nthe distance between them, and in fact loop operators form a commutative\nring. In the case of Wilson loop operators, it is straightforward to show\nthat this ring is the representation ring of G. In the case of 't Hooft loop\noperators, it has effectively been argued in [5] that the ring is the K 0 -group\nof the category of equivariant perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian\nGrG . It has been shown by Lusztig [6] that this ring is the representation\nring of L G; a categorification of this statement, known as the geometric\nSatake correspondence, has been proved in [7, 8, 9]. As explained in [5], the\ngeometric Satake correspondence can also be interpreted in physical terms,\nby replacing loop operators with line operators.\nYang-Mills theory also admits mixed Wilson-'t Hooft loop operators. As\nexplained in [3], they are labeled by elements of the set\nb\n\u039b(G)/W\n= (\u039bw (G) \u2295 \u039bw (L G))/W,\n\nwhere \u039bw (G) is the weight lattice of G and W is the Weyl group (which is\nthe same for G and L G). It is natural to ask what controls the product of\nsuch more general operators. The answer must somehow unify the representation theory of G and L G. In this paper we partially answer this question.\nA natural framework for it is the holomorphic-topological twisted version of\n1\n\n\fthe N = 4 SYM theory described in [10], since it admits Wilson-'t Hooft\n1\nb\nloop operators labeled by arbitrary elements of \u039b/W.\nAs explained in [10],\nWilson-'t Hooft loop operators in the twisted theory form a commutative\nring, and this ring is abstractly isomorphic to the Weyl-invariant part of the\nb\ngroup algebra \u039b(G).\nBut this does not completely determine the operator\nproduct, since we do not yet know which element of the group algebra correb\nsponds to a particular element of the set \u039b(G)/W\nlabeling Wilson-'t Hooft\nloop operators.\nIn this paper we determine the answer for G = P SU(2) and G = SU(2)\nassuming S-duality, and then verify the prediction in a special case by a direct\ngauge-theory computation at weak coupling. We also outline a procedure for\ncomputing the product of Wilson-t' Hooft loop operators for arbitrary G.\nThe procedure is very similar to that for 't Hooft operators in [5]. As in [5],\nan important role is played by the fact that loop operators can be promoted\nto line operators, i.e. \"open\" analogs of loop operators. While loop operators\nform a commutative ring, line operators form a monoidal category (i.e. an\nadditive category with a \"tensor product\"). We argue below that the ring\nof loop operators can be thought of as the K 0 -group of the category of line\noperators. The Montonen-Olive duality predicts that these categories for\ngauge groups G and L G are equivalent. In some sense, this can be viewed\nas the classical limit of the geometric Satake correspondence, but G and\nL\nG enter more symmetrically. As discussed in the concluding section, this\nconjecture, when interpreted in mathematical terms, has previously appeared\nin [15].\n\n2\n\nA brief review of the Hitchin moduli space\n\nIn this preliminary section we review some basic facts about the moduli space\nof Hitchin equations MH (G, C) and the sigma-model with target MH (G, C).\nThe reader familiar with this material may skip this section. A more detailed\ndiscussion may be found in [5].\nGiven a gauge group G, let us consider a principal G-bundle E over a\nRiemann surface C, a connection A on E, and a 1-form \u03c6 with values in\n1\n\nIn the topological field theory described in [5], depending on the choice of a BRST\noperator, either Wilson or 't Hooft loop operators may exist, but not both at the same\ntime. In what follows we will refer to this TFT as the GL-twisted theory, where GL stands\nfor \"geometric Langlands\".\n\n2\n\n\fad(E). The Hitchin equations are\nF \u2212 i \u03c6\u2227\u03c6 = 0,\n\nD\u03c6 = 0,\n\nD \u22c6 \u03c6 = 0,\n\nwhere D = d + iA is the covariant differential, F = \u2212iD 2 is the curvature\nof A, and \u22c6 is the Hodge star operator. The space of solutions of this equations modulo gauge transformations is known as the Hitchin moduli space\nand will be denoted MH (G, C) or simply MH (we suppress E from the notation, because we regard MH (G, C) as a disconnected sum of components\ncorresponding to all possible topological types of E).\nA crucial fact for us is that MH is a hyperk\u00e4hler manifold. In particular, it has three complex structures I, J, K satisfying IJ = K. One way to\ndescribe these complex structures explicitly is to specify holomorphic coordinates on MH . For a local complex coordinate z on C we write\nA = Az dz + Az\u0304 dz\u0304,\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6z dz + \u03c6z\u0304 dz\u0304.\n\nFor the complex structure I the holomorphic coordinates are Az\u0304 and \u03c6z .\nFor the complex structure J the holomorphic coordinates are Az\u0304 + i\u03c6z\u0304 and\nAz + i\u03c6z . Finally, the complex structure K is defined by the quaternion relation K = IJ. In the present paper we mostly work with complex structure\nI and use notation MHiggs (G, C) for MH (G, C) with this choice of complex structure. The reason for this notation is that MH equipped with the\ncomplex structure I is naturally identified with the moduli space of Higgs\nbundles, i.e. pairs (E, \u03c6), where E is a holomorphic GC bundle, and \u03c6 is\na holomorphic section of KC \u2297 ad(E). This identification maps the triple\n(E, A, \u03c6) to the holomorphic GC -bundle defined by the (0, 1) part of D and\nthe holomorphic Higgs field \u03c6 = \u03c61,0 . Note that the subset of MHiggs (G, C)\ngiven by \u03c6 = 0 is the moduli space of stable holomorphic GC bundles, which\nwe will denote M(G, C).\nIn the complex structure J the Hitchin moduli space can be identified\nwith the moduli space of flat GC connections on C; this moduli space was\ndenoted Mf lat (G, C) in [5]. But this identification will not play a role in this\npaper.\nConsider now the supersymmetric sigma-model with target MH . Since\nMH is hyperk\u00e4hler, such a sigma-model has N = (4, 4) supersymmetry. One\nmay twist this sigma-model into a topological field theory by picking a pair of\ncomplex structures (J+ , J\u2212 ) on MH (G, C). For J+ = J\u2212 one gets a B-model,\nwhile for J+ = \u2212J\u2212 one gets an A-model. In this paper we will be mostly\n3\n\n\finterested in the special case J+ = J\u2212 = I, i.e. the B-model in complex\nstructure I.\nGiven a topological twist of the sigma-model, one can consider the corresponding category of topological branes. This is a category of boundary\nconditions for the sigma-model on a worldsheet of the form R \u00d7 I where I\nis the unit interval. The boundary conditions are required to be invariant\nwith respect to the BRST operator of the twisted model. Equivalently, one\nmay say that the boundary conditions are required to preserve one complex\nsupercharge (in the untwisted theory). But since the untwisted model has\n(4, 4) supersymmetry, there also exist branes which preserve two complex\nsupercharges. Such branes are compatible with more than one topological\ntwist. In this paper we will encounter (B, B, B)-branes, which are B-branes\nin complex structures I, J, K, as well as (B, A, A)-branes which are of B-type\nin complex structure I and of A\u2212type in the other two complex structures.\n\n3\n\nHolomorphic-topological twist of N = 4 SYM\n\nLet us recall how one can twist N = 4 gauge theory on \u03a3 \u00d7 C into a\nholomorphic-topological theory [10] which upon reduction gives the B-model\non \u03a3 with target MHiggs (G, C). It is convenient to treat N = 4 SYM\nas N = 2 SYM with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation. The\ntheory has SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)N \u00d7 U(1)B symmetry. The holonomy group is\nU(1)C \u00d7 U(1)\u03a3 . One twists U(1)C action by a suitable linear combination of\nU(1)R \u2282 SU(2)R and U(1)B , and twists U(1)\u03a3 by U(1)N .\nThe resulting field theory has the following bosonic fields: the gauge field\nA, the adjoint Higgs field \u03c6 = \u03a6w dw \u2208 K\u03a3 \u2297 ad(E), the adjoint Higgs field\nq = qz\u0304 dz\u0304 \u2208 K\u0304C \u2297 ad(E), and the adjoint Higgs field q\u0303 \u2208 ad(E). Here K\u03a3 and\nKC are the pull-backs of the canonical line bundles of \u03a3 and C to \u03a3 \u00d7 C.\nWe also define \u03a6w\u0304 = \u03a6\u2020w and qz = qz\u0304\u2020 .\nThe fermionic fields are the \"gauginos\" \u03bbw , \u03bb\u0304w\u0304 , \u03bbz , \u03bb\u0304z , \u03bbz\u0304w , \u03bb\u0304z\u0304w\u0304 , \u03bbww\u0304 , \u03bb\u0304ww\u0304\nand the \"quarks\" \u03c8w\u0304 , \u03c7w , \u03c8z\u0304 , \u03c7z\u0304 , \u03c7z w\u0304 , \u03c8zw , \u03c7z z\u0304 , \u03c8z z\u0304 . The fermions are all in\nthe adjoint representation.\nThe field content depends on complex structures of C and \u03a3. The dependence on the complex structure on C is inescapable, but the dependence\non the complex structure on \u03a3 is merely an artifact of our way of presentation. It is possible to combine fields with holomorphic and anti-holomorphic\nindices into form-valued fields on \u03a3 so that the dependence on the complex\n4\n\n\fstructure on \u03a3 is eliminated [10].\nIn order to specify the theory completely, one has to pick a BRST operator. The twisted theory has two BRST operators Ql and Qr which square\nto zero and anticommute, so the most general BRST operator is\nQ = uQl + vQr ,\nwhere u, v are homogeneous coordinates on P1 . It is often convenient to work\nwith an affine coordinate t = v/u taking values in C \u222a {\u221e}. To get a theory\nwhich is topological on \u03a3 and holomorphic on C, one needs to assume that\nu and v are both nonzero, i.e. t 6= 0, \u221e [10].2 The precise choice of t then\ndoes not matter [10]; we let t = i from now on.\nThe action of the twisted theory can be written as a sum of a BRSTexact piece and a piece which is independent of the gauge coupling e2 and\nthe \u03b8-parameter (after a rescaling of fermions). Therefore semiclassical computations in the twisted theory are exact [10]. We will use this important\nfact throughout the rest of the paper.\nThe path-integral of the twisted theory localizes on Q-invariant field configurations. The conditions of Q-invariance imply, among other things, that\nthe complex connection A = A + i\u03c6 + i\u03c6\u2020 has a curvature F whose only\nnonzero components are along \u03a3. In the limit when the volume of C goes to\nzero, the equations simplify and imply the Hitchin equations for Az and qz\nFz z\u0304 \u2212 i[qz , qz\u0304 ] = 0,\n\nDz\u0304 qz = 0\n\nas well as\nDz\u0304 q\u0303 \u2020 = 0,\nwhich implies that q\u0303 is generically zero. Thus in this limit the field theory\nreduces to a sigma-model with target MHiggs (G, C). There are further equations which say that this sigma-model is a B-model in the natural complex\nstructure (the one which we denote I).\nThe Montonen-Olive duality, as usually defined, maps G to L G and maps\n[5, 10] the BRST operator at t = i to another BRST operator with\nL\n\nt=\n\n|\u03c4 |\nt.\n\u03c4\n\n2\n\nIf t = 0 or t = \u221e, the twisted theory is holomorphic on both C and \u03a3. Such a theory\ndoes not admit line operators which we are interested in.\n\n5\n\n\fBut since the phase of t can be changed by an automorphism of the theory (an\nR-symmetry transformation), one can redefine the Montonen-Olive duality\nso that it leaves t invariant. We adopt this definition of Montonen-Olive\nduality from now on.\nIn this paper we mostly focus on the case when \u03a3 has a flat metric. Then\nthe twist along \u03a3 is a trivial operation, and the theory can be regarded as\ntwisted only along C. In the limit vol(C) \u2192 0 it becomes equivalent to an\nuntwisted supersymmetric sigma-model with target MH (G, C). Since MH\nis hyperk\u00e4hler, this sigma-model has N = (4, 4) supersymmetry, i.e. it has\ntwo left-moving and two right-moving complex supercharges, as well as their\ncomplex conjugates. The BRST operator defined above is a particular linear\ncombination of these supercharges. The BRST operator of the GL twisted\ntheory considered in [5] is another such linear combination (depending on a\nsingle complex parameter t). Both kinds of BRST operators can be included\ninto a more general three-parameter family of BRST operators [5].\n\n4\n4.1\n\nWilson-'t Hooft operators in the twisted\ntheory\nDefinition\n\nIn any gauge theory one can define various loop operators: Wilson, 't Hooft,\nand Wilson-'t Hooft. The Wilson loop operator in representation R is usually\ndefined as\nZ\nWR (\u03b3) = TrR P exp i A\n\u03b3\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a closed curve. Instead of labeling the operator by an irreducible\nrepresentation, one can label it by the orbit of its highest weight under the\nWeyl group. The 't Hooft loop operator is a disorder operator defined by\nthe requirement that near a curve \u03b3 the gauge field has a singularity of a\nDirac-monopole kind. Such singularities are labeled by conjugacy classes of\nhomomorphisms from U(1) to G, which is equivalent to saying that they\nare labeled by orbits of the Weyl group in the coweight lattice \u039bcw of G.\nMore generally, Wilson-'t Hooft operators are labeled by Weyl orbits in the\nproduct \u039bw (G) \u00d7 \u039bcw (G) [3].\nIn the N = 4 SYM theory there are more possibilities for loop operators,\nsince one can construct them not only from gauge fields, but also from other\n6\n\n\ffields. By imposing natural symmetry requirements (namely, the geometric symmetries and supersymmetry), one can cut down on the number of\npossibilities.\nIn the twisted N = 4 theory we have to require that loop operators be\nBRST-invariant. For t = i, we see that none of the components of A are\nBRST-invariant. But we also see that Aw = Aw + i\u03a6w and Aw\u0304 = Aw\u0304 + i\u03a6w\u0304\nare BRST-invariant. Hence if \u03b3 is a closed curve on \u03a3 and p is a point on C,\nthe Wilson operator\nZ\nWR (\u03b3, p) = TrR P exp i\nA\n\u03b3\u00d7p\n\nis BRST-invariant.\nBy MO duality, there should also be BRST-invariant 't Hooft operators\nat t = i.3 Indeed, if \u03b3 is given by the equation x1 = Rew = 0 and we require\nthe gauge field to have a Dirac-like singularity in the x1 , x2 , x3 plane:\n\u0010\u03bc\u0011\nF \u223c \u22c63 d\n(1)\n2r\n\nfor some \u03bc \u2208 g, then the condition of Q-invariance requires \u03a6w to be singular\nas well:\n\u03bc\n\u03a6w \u223c .\n(2)\n2r\nIt is a plausible guess that such a disorder operator is mapped to the Wilson\noperator by the MO duality.\nFinally, we may consider more general Wilson-'t Hooft loop operators\nwhich source both electric and magnetic fields. Roughly speaking, they are\nproducts of Wilson and 't Hooft operators. To define a WH loop operator\nmore precisely, let it be localized at x1,2,3 = 0. Then we require the components of the curvature in the 123 plane to have a singularity as in (1), the real\npart of \u03a6w to have a singularity as in (2), and insert into the path-integral a\nfactor\nZ\nTrR P exp i\nA\n\u03b3\u00d7p\n\nwhere R is an irreducible representation of the stabilizer subgroup G\u03bc \u2282 G\nof \u03bc. This definition makes sense because in the infinitesimal neighborhood\n3\n\nThis is unlike the GL twisted theory, where for t = i only Wilson operators are\nBRST-invariant.\n\n7\n\n\fof \u03b3 the component of A tangent to \u03b3 must lie in the centralizer subalgebra\ng\u03bc \u2282 g of \u03bc [3]. One may describe R by specifying its highest weight \u03bd,\nwhich is defined up to an action of the subgroup of the Weyl group which\npreserves \u03bc. The net result is that the WH operator is labeled by a pair\n(\u03bc, \u03bd) \u2208 \u039bcw (G) \u00d7 \u039bw (G) defined up to the action of the Weyl group W.\nb\nb L G). The\nWe will denote the abelian group \u039bcw (G) \u00d7 \u039bw (G) by \u039b(G)\n= \u039b(\nWH operator labeled by the Weyl-equivalence class of (\u03bc, \u03bd) will be denoted\nW T\u03bc,\u03bd (\u03b3, p).\nb\nThere is a natural action of the S-duality group on \u039b(G).\nIt is a natural\nconjecture that this is how the S-duality group acts on the corresponding\nWH operators. One of the goals of this paper is to test this conjecture.\nNote that all our loop operators are localized at points on C. If we take\nthe volume of \u03a3 to be small compared to that of C, then the twisted theory\nreduces to an effective 2d field theory on C, and in this effective 2d field\ntheory our loop operators behave in all ways like local operators. There are\nno BRST-invariant operators which are localized on loops in C.\n\n4.2\n\nBasic properties\n\nAs explained in [10], in the twisted theory all correlators depend holomorphically on coordinates on C and are invariant under arbitrary diffeomorphisms\nof \u03a3. This puts strong constraints on the correlators of WH loop operators.\nWe will be mostly interested in the Operator Product Expansion of WH\nloop operators. That is, we will assume that \u03a3 is flat, pick a pair of points\np, p\u2032 \u2208 C and a pair of straight lines \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 on \u03a3 and consider a pair of\nWH operators localized on \u03b3 \u00d7 p and \u03b3 \u2032 \u00d7 p\u2032 . So far, we have assumed that\nthe curve on which the WH operator is localized is closed; if we want to\nmaintain this, we may assume that \u03a3 locally looks like a cylinder with a flat\nmetric; since the theory is diffeomorphism-invariant along \u03a3, the only thing\nthat matters is that both \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 are closed and isotopic to each other. One\nmay also consider WH operators localized on lines rather than closed curves;\nwe will return to this possibility later.\nConsider now a correlator involving these WH loop operators. If \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032\ndo not have common points, then there is no singularity as one takes the limit\nwhere p coincides with p\u2032 . If z is a local complex coordinate on C centered at\np, then the correlator is a holomorphic function of z(p\u2032 ) in the neighborhood\nof zero. By continuity, this implies that even when \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 coincide, the\n\n8\n\n\fcorrelator is a holomorphic function of z. Therefore the Operator Product of\nany two WH operators is nonsingular. More generally, this conclusion holds\nfor any two BRST-invariant loop operators in the twisted theory which are\nlocalized on C.\nGiven this result, we can define a commutative algebra of loop operators, simply by taking the coincidence limit. For Wilson and 't Hooft loop\noperators this result can be more easily obtained using the GL twisted theory of [5], but here we see that it holds for general loop operators in the\nholomorphic-topological twisted theory.\nAt this stage it is natural to ask whether the subspace spanned by WH\noperators is closed with respect to the operator product. More optimistically,\none could hope that WH operators form a basis in the space of loop operators\nin the twisted theory, and therefore the vector space spanned by them is\nautomatically closed with respect to the operator product. We will argue\nbelow that both statements are true, if only closed loops are considered.\n\n4.3\n\nLine versus loop operators\n\nAs emphasized in [5], one may also consider analogs of Wilson and 't Hooft\noperators localized on open curves instead of loops. The endpoints of a curve\nmust lie on the boundaries of the four-manifold. Such \"operators\" are called\nline operators in [5]. We put the word \"operators\" in quotes because they do\nnot act on the Hilbert space of the theory; rather, they alter the definition\nof the Hilbert space of the theory.\nTo be concrete, suppose \u03a3 = R \u00d7 X1 , where X1 is either S 1 or an interval\nI. We regard R as the time direction. Consider a Wilson line operator\nWR (\u03b3, p), where \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3 has the form R \u00d7 q for some q \u2208 X1 . Insertion of\nsuch a Wilson line operator means that the Hilbert space of the gauge theory\nhas to be modified: instead of gauge-invariant wave-functions on the space of\nfields on X1 \u00d7 C, one has to consider gauge-invariant elements of the tensor\nproduct of the space of all wave-functions and the representation space of R.\nSimilarly, when we insert an open 't Hooft operator, we have to change the\nclass of fields on which the wave-functions are defined.\nWhile loop operators form a commutative algebra, line operators form\na category. A morphism between line operators A and B is a local BRSTinvariant operator inserted at a junction of A and B. Composition of morphisms is defined in an obvious way. There is also an obvious structure of\na complex vector space on the space of morphisms and an obvious way to\n9\n\n\fdefine a sum of line operators. Thus line operators form an additive C-linear\ncategory.\nThe distinction between line and loop operators has played some role in [5]\nand it is even more important in the context of the holomorphic-topological\ntheory, as we will see below.\nIt is often convenient to relax the condition that local operators inserted\nat the junction of two line operators be BRST-invariant, and define the space\nof morphisms to be the space of all local operators. This space is graded by\nthe ghost number and is acted upon by the BRST-differential. Thus the set\nof morphisms between any two line operators has the structure of a complex of vector spaces, and composition of morphisms is compatible with the\ndifferentials. That is, line operators form a differential graded category (DGcategory). This viewpoint is convenient for keeping track of the dependence\nof various correlators on parameters, such as the insertion point on C (see\nbelow).\nThere is one more important operation for line operators in the twisted\ntheory: an associative tensor product. In other words, the category of line\noperators is a monoidal category. The product is defined by taking two\nline operators \"side-by-side\" on \u03a3 and \"fusing\" them together. The product\nof line operators need not be commutative, in general. But for Wilson't Hooft line operators it is commutative because of a discrete symmetry:\nparity reversal. Indeed, consider the twisted gauge theory on R \u00d7 R \u00d7 C,\nwhere we regard the first copy of R as time and the second one as space.\nIt is easy to check that spatial reflection x \u2192 \u2212x is a symmetry of the\ntheory.4 Furthermore, Wilson-'t Hooft line operators are invariant under\nthis symmetry. Therefore, we can change the order of WH line operators on\nthe spatial line by a symmetry transformation.\n\n4.4\n\nRemarks on TFT in arbitrary dimension\n\nA similar discussion applies to the GL twisted theory considered in [5], and\nin fact to any topological field theory in any number of dimensions. That is,\nin any TFT line operators form a monoidal C-linear additive category.\nIn the case of a TFT in dimension d > 3 the fusion product is necessarily symmetric, because there is no diffeomorphism-invariant way to order\nline operators. In dimension d = 3 there may be nontrivial braiding, so in\n4\n\nThis is particularly obvious from a 2d viewpoint, as any B-model is parity-invariant.\n\n10\n\n\fgeneral the category of line operators is braided rather than symmetric. A\nwell-known example is the Chern-Simons theory [11], where the category of\nWilson line operators is equivalent to the category of representations of a\nquantum group. In dimension d = 2 the monoidal structure need not be\neither symmetric or braided, in general.\nIn this paper we are dealing with a holomorphic-topological field theory rather than a TFT, and the \"topological\" part of the manifold is twodimensional. From the abstract viewpoint the situation is very much like in a\n2d TFT, because every line operator in the twisted gauge theory on \u03a3\u00d7C can\nbe regarded as a line operator in the B-model on \u03a3 with target MHiggs (G, C).\nBut the converse is not necessarily true, because line operators in gauge theory are local on C, while line operators in the B-model on \u03a3 are not subject\nto this constraint. (Below we will construct a large class of examples of line\noperators in the B-model which do not lift to ordinary line operators in the\ngauge theory.) To enforce locality, one has to keep track of the dependence\nof all correlators on the insertion point p \u2208 C of the line operator. To put\nit differently, if we denote by V(q, p) the Hilbert space of the twisted theory\non R \u00d7 X1 \u00d7 C with an insertion of a line operator at q \u00d7 p \u2208 X1 \u00d7 C, then\nfor fixed q this family of vector spaces can be thought of as a holomorphic\nvector bundle Vq over C. Similarly, spaces of morphisms between different\nline operators can be thought of as holomorphic vector bundles over C.\nTo make precise the idea of a \"holomorphically varying space of morphisms\", it is very convenient to take the viewpoint that the space of morphisms is a differential graded vector space, i.e. a complex. Let W(p) be\nthe vector space of all (not necessarily BRST-invariant) local operators inserted at the junction of two line operators A and B, both located at a point\np \u2208 C. The space W(p) is graded by the ghost number and carries the\nBRST-differential Q. The complexes W(p) fit into a complex of smooth vector bundles W on C. Let us tensor this complex of vector bundles with the\nDolbeault complex of C. The resulting space of sections is acted upon by\nboth Q and \u2202 \u0304 and carries all the information about the dependence of morphisms on p. \"Holomorphic dependence\" means simply that \u2202 \u0304 is Q-exact,\nand therefore acts trivially on the cohomology of Q.\nWe can put our discussion of line operators in a more general perspective\nby noting that n-dimensional TFTs form a n-category. 1-Morphisms in this\nn-category are codimension-1 walls separating a pair of TFTs. We will call\ncodimension-1 walls 1-walls, for short. 1-walls themselves form an n \u2212 1\ncategory: 2-morphisms are codimension-2 walls which separate different 111\n\n\fwalls between the same pair of TFTs. And so on.\nIf we consider all 1-walls between a pair of identical TFTs, they can\nbe \"fused\" together. This gives a kind of monoidal structure on an n \u2212 1\ncategory of 1-walls. In this n \u2212 1-category there is a unit object: the \"trivial\n1-wall\" which is equivalent to no wall at all. 2-walls living on the trivial\n1-wall form a monoidal n \u2212 2 category with a unit, and so on. Thus line\noperators considered above belong to a rather special variety: they live on\na trivial n \u2212 2 wall which lives on a trivial n \u2212 3-wall, etc. For example,\nin the GL twisted theory at t = i Wilson line operators form a category\nwhich is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional representations of\nG. Gukov and Witten also considered nontrivial 2-walls in this theory and\nline operators living on such 2-walls [12].\nBoundary conditions for an n-dimensional TFT also fit into this general\nscheme: they are 1-morphisms between a given TFT and an \"empty\" TFT.\nFor this reason they form an n \u2212 1 category (which is not monoidal, in\ngeneral). A special case of this is the well-known fact that D-branes in a 2d\nTFT form a category.\nIn connection with possible 2-dimensional generalizations of the Geometric Langlands Duality, it would be interesting to understand the 3-category of\nboundary conditions for the GL twisted N = 4 SYM, as well as the monoidal\n3-category of 1-walls in the same theory. The latter acts on the former. These\n3-categories appear to be suitable 2d generalizations of the derived category\nof Mf lat (G, C) and the representation category of G, respectively.\n\n4.5\n\nDeformations of line operators\n\nIn the case of the GL twisted theory at t = i the product of two parallel\nWilson loop operators WR1 and WR2 is a Wilson loop operator WR1 \u2297R2 . This\nmeans that Wilson loop operators form a closed algebra, which happens\nto be commutative and associative. Wilson loop operators corresponding\nto irreducible representations of G form a basis in this algebra. A similar\nstatement holds for Wilson line operators: the subcategory of Wilson line operators is closed with respect to the monoidal structure, i.e. it is a symmetric\nmonoidal category, and any Wilson line operator is isomorphic to a direct\nsum of Wilson line operators corresponding to irreducible representations of\nG. By S-duality, similar statements hold for 't Hooft operators in the GL\ntwisted theory (for t = 1).\nAt t = i any line operator in the GL-twisted theory is isomorphic to a\n12\n\n\fWilson line operator for some R (which can be reducible). One way to see\nit is to first classify line operators with the right bosonic symmetries in the\nuntwisted theory (this has been done in [3]) and then impose the condition of\nBRST-invariance. A similar statement holds for 't Hooft operators at t = 1.\nOne consequence of this is that there are no infinitesimal deformations of\nWilson line operators in the GL-twisted theory. This can also be checked directly. From the mathematical viewpoint, infinitesimal deformations of a line\noperator A are classified by degree-1 cohomology of the complex Hom(A, A).\nOne can check that this cohomology is trivial by considering BRST-invariant\nlocal operators which can be inserted at a point of the Wilson line A.\nFor line operators in the holomorphic-topological twisted theory the situation is more complicated. The difficulty is that twisting breaks SO(3)\nrotational symmetry used in [3] down to U(1). A generic Wilson-'t Hooft\noperators (i.e. not purely electric or purely magnetic) also preserves only\nrotation symmetry in the z-plane (which is present when C \u2243 C).\nThe simplest question one can ask in this regard is whether there are\ninfinitesimal deformations of a Wilson-'t Hooft line operator. One obvious\ndeformation arises from varying the insertion point on C. For a Wilson line\nWR (p), is easy to exhibit the degree-1 endomorphism corresponding to such\na deformation. It is a fermionic field\n\u0393z = \u03bbz + \u03bb\u0304z .\nIt is BRST-invariant and can be inserted into a Wilson line in any representation R. The corresponding infinitesimal deformation of WR (p) is obtained\nas follows. First, we apply the descent procedure to \u0393z , i.e. look for a boson\n\u2206z such that\nD\u03a3 \u0393z = \u03b4\u2206z .\n\nNote the covariant differential on the left-hand side. Usually, descent is applied to gauge-invariant operators, in which case one uses ordinary de Rham\ndifferential. In our case, the operator becomes gauge-invariant only after\ninsertion into a Wilson line, and this requires replacing ordinary differential\nwith the covariant one. The descent equation is solved by\n\u2206z = Fzw dw + Fz w\u0304 dw\u0304.\nThe deformed Wilson operator is\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\nz\nTrR P exp i A + \u2206z \u01eb\n13\n\n\fwhere \u01ebz is an infinitesimal parameter. It is easy to see that this is the same\nas a Wilson operator evaluated at a nearby point, shifted from p by a vector\n\u01ebz \u2202z .\nSimilarly, given any two line operators and a degree-1 morphism between\nthem, one can construct their \"bound state\", which is a deformation of the\ndirect sum of the two line operators. In homological algebra, this is known as\nthe mapping cone construction. In section 6.1 we will see some examples of\nthe mapping cone construction with less obvious deformations of Wilson-'t\nHooft line operators which do not correspond to changing the insertion point\non C.\n\n4.6\n\nLine operators and K-theory\n\nThe existence of nontrivial deformations suggests that the category of Wilson't Hooft line operators may not be closed with respect to the tensor product.\nBut we will argue below that the space of Wilson-'t Hooft loop operators is\nclosed with respect to the product. Therefore it is important to understand\nthe relationship between loop and line operators. We would like to argue\nhere that loop operators should be thought of as elements of the K 0 -group\nof the category of line operators. The closure of the space of Wilson-'t Hooft\nloop operators under operator product suggests that these operators form a\nbasis for the K 0 -group of the category of line operators, but we will not try\nto prove this here.\nFirst, let us recall the definition of the K 0 -group of a DG-algebra A. A\nfinitely-generated projective DG-module over A is any DG-module which can\nbe obtained from free DG-modules of finite rank using the following three\noperations: shift of grading, cone, and taking a direct summand. Consider a\nfree abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes of finitely-generated\nprojective DG-modules and quotient it by the relations\nM \u223c (\u22121)n M[n]\nfor any integer n, and\nM1 \u2295 M2 \u223c M\n\nfor any exact sequence of DG-modules\n\n0 \u2192 M1 \u2192 M \u2192 M2 \u2192 0.\nThis quotient group is K 0 (A).\n14\n\n\fThe definition of the K 0 -group of a small DG-category A is similar.5\nThe idea is to think about a category as an \"algebra with several objects\".\nA DG-module M over a small DG-category A is a DG-functor from A to\nthe DG-category of complexes of vector spaces. In more detail, it is a\ncollection of DG-modules M(A) over the DG-algebras HomA(A, A) for all\nA \u2208 Ob(A) and DG-morphisms from the complex HomA(A, B) to the complex Hom(M(A), M(B)) for any A, B \u2208 Ob(A). These data should satisfy\nsome fairly obvious compatibility conditions.\nThe analog of a free rank-1 DG-module is a presentable DG-module MB\ncorresponding to an object B of A. Given any B \u2208 Ob(A), we let MB (A) =\nHomA(B, A). It has an obvious DG-module structure over the DG-algebra\nHomA(A, A). A finitely-generated projective DG-module over A is a DGmodule which is obtained from presentable modules by the operations of\nshift, cone, and taking a direct summand. To get the K 0 -group of A, we\nconsider the free abelian group generated by isomorphism classes of finitelygenerated projective DG-modules and quotient it by the relations coming\nfrom shift of grading and short exact sequences of DG-modules.\nNow let A be the DG-category of line operators. A presentable DGmodule corresponding to a line operator B is a module MB such that MB(A)\nis the space of local operators which can be inserted at the joining point of\nline operators B and A. There is a special line operator: the Wilson line\ncorresponding to the trivial representation of G. It is a unit object with\nrespect to the monoidal structure on A. The space of local operators which\ncan be inserted at such a trivial line operator is the same as the space of\n\"bulk\" local operators.\nA loop operator is a line operator with no insertions of local operators\nand with the endpoints identified. A convenient geometry to study a loop\noperator A is to take \u03a3 = S\u03c41 \u00d7 S\u03c31 , where S\u03c41 is regarded as the compactified\nEuclidean time and S\u03c31 is the compactified spatial direction. We consider an\narbitrary number of insertions of line operators, one of which is our A. All\nline operators are taken to \"run\" along the \u03c4 direction and are located at\nfixed \u03c3. We also allow arbitrary local insertions at all line operators except\nA. This includes bulk local operator insertions, which may be regarded as\nlocal operators sitting on the trivial line operator. If all such correlators are\nunchanged when one replaces A with another loop operator A\u2032 , it is natural\n5\n\nA small category is a category whose objects are members of a set rather than a class.\nWe sincerely hope that line operators in a twisted gauge theory form a set.\n\n15\n\n\fto identify A and A\u2032 . We claim that this happens if A-modules MA and MA\u2032\nare in the same K 0 class.\nTo see this, let us reformulate the set-up slightly. First of all, we can\nlump all line operators except A and all bulk local operators into a single line\noperator B with a single insertion. It is easy to see that the Hilbert space\nof the twisted gauge theory on R \u00d7 S\u03c31 \u00d7 C is the homology of the complex\nHomA(A, B). Equivalently, we can say that it is the homology of MA (B). The\nlocal operator inserted into B can be thought of as an endomorphism T of\nthe complex MA(B), and the correlator is the supertrace of T . It is obvious\nthat shifting the grading of MA by n changes the supertrace by a factor\n(\u22121)n . The other equivalence relation has to do with short exact sequences\nof A-modules. If MA is the middle term of a short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 M1 \u2192 MA \u2192 M2 \u2192 0,\nthen we have a short exact sequence of complexes\n0 \u2192 M1 (B) \u2192 MA(B) \u2192 M2 (B) \u2192 0\nand the corresponding long exact sequence in homology. The endomorphism\nT of M induces an endomorphism T of this long exact sequence, regarded\nas a complex of vector spaces. We may assume that both T and T are of\ndegree zero, since otherwise all supertraces vanish for trivial reasons. Now\nthe statement that the supertrace of T depends only on the K 0 -class of A is\nequivalent to the statement that the supertrace of T vanishes. But this is\nan immediate consequence of exactness: if d denotes the differential in the\nlong exact sequence, and R denotes the sum of all terms in the long exact\nsequence regarded as a graded vector space, then by exactness one can write\nT = dP + Pd,\nfor some linear map P : R \u2192 R of degree \u22121. The supertrace of the anticommutator of two odd endomorphisms of a graded vector space obviously\nvanishes.\n\n4.7\n\nLine operators as functors on branes\n\nWe have seen that in the twisted theory line operators form a monoidal Clinear category, or, better, a monoidal DG-category. As in [5], it is useful to\n16\n\n\fthink of objects of this category as functors on the category of B-branes on\nMHiggs (G, C). This makes the monoidal structure more obvious: it is simply\ngiven by the composition of functors.6\nIt is particularly simple to describe the functor corresponding to a Wilson\nline operator WR (p). It tensors every B-brane on MHiggs (G, C) by a holomorphic vector bundle R(E(p)), where E(p) is a restriction to p \u2208 C of the\nuniversal G-bundle E on MHiggs (G, C) \u00d7 C [5].\nThe functor corresponding to an 't Hooft operator is a Hecke transformation, as explained in [5]. Let us remind what a Hecke transformation is in\nthe case G = U(N). Instead of a principal U(N)-bundle, it is convenient to\nwork with a holomorphic vector bundle E associated via the tautological Ndimensional representation of U(N). A Hecke transformation of E\u2212 = E at a\npoint p \u2208 C is another holomorphic vector bundle E+ of the same rank which\nis isomorphic to E\u2212 on C\\p. One can always choose a basis of holomorphic\nsections f1 , . . . , fN of E\u2212 near p so that E+ is locally generated by\ns1 = z \u2212\u03bc1 f1 , . . . , sN = z \u2212\u03bcN fN ,\nwhere \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcN are integers. The integers \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcN are well-defined modulo permutation and can be thought of as a coweight of U(N) modulo the\naction of the Weyl group. For fixed E\u2212 and \u03bc, the space of allowed E+ is\na finite-dimensional submanifold C\u03bc of the infinite-dimensional affine Grassmannian GL(N, C((z)))/GL(N, C[[z]]), where C((z)) is the field of formal\nLaurent series and C[[z]] is the ring of formal Taylor series. Specifically, C\u03bc\nis the orbit of the matrix\nZ\u03bc (z) = diag(z \u2212\u03bc1 , . . . , z \u2212\u03bcN )\nunder the left action of GL(N, C[[z]]). This\nformations act on structure sheaves of points\nOne can similarly define the transformation\na nontrivial Higgs field, see [5] for details.\nHooft/Hecke operators act on more general\nbranes, but we will not need this here.\n6\n\ndescribes how 't Hooft transon M(G, C) \u2282 MHiggs (G, C).\nof a more general point with\nOne can also define how 't\nobjects of the category of B-\n\nAlternatively, one can regard a B-brane as a 1-morphism between an empty theory\nand the B-model on MHiggs (G, C), regarded as objects of the 2-category of 2d TFTs,\nand one can regard a line operator as a 1-morphism from the B-model to itself. Then the\naction of the line operator on the brane is given by the composition of 1-morphisms.\n\n17\n\n\fFor a general gauge group G, the situation is similar. One defines the\naffine Grassmannian GrG as the quotient G((z))/G[[z]], where G((z)) is the\ngroup of GC -valued Laurent series and G[[z]] is the group of GC -valued Taylor series. GrG is a union of Schubert cells C\u03bc labeled by the elements of\n\u039bcw (G)/W. For a fixed coweight \u03bc the space of Hecke transformations of a\nholomorphic G-bundle E\u2212 is the corresponding Schubert cell C\u03bc .\nThe functor corresponding to a general Wilson-'t Hooft operator is a combination of a Hecke transformation and tensoring with a certain holomorphic\nvector bundle on C\u03bc . For simplicity, let us only consider the case when the\ninitial B-brane is a point E\u2212 of M(G, C) \u2282 MHiggs (G, C). Recall that the\n\"electric\" part of the Wilson-'t Hooft operator can be described by a representation R of the group H which is the stabilizer subgroup of the coweight\n\u03bc (under the adjoint representation). Clearly, the electric degree of freedom\nwill live in some vector bundle over C\u03bc . This bundle is associated via R to a\ncertain principal H-bundle over C\u03bc .\nTo determine this bundle, note that over C\u03bc there is a principal G-bundle\nwhose fiber can be identified with the fiber of E+ over z = 0. A formal\ndefinition, in the case G = U(N), is as follows. C\u03bc can be thought of as the\nset of equivalence classes of matrix functions of the form\nF (z)Z\u03bc (z)G(z),\n\nF (z), G(z) \u2208 GL(N, C[[z]]),\n\nZ\u03bc (z) = diag(z \u2212\u03bc1 , . . . , z \u2212\u03bcN )\n\nunder the right action of GL(N, C[[z]]). Let us now replace GL(N, C[[z]])\nwith its subgroup GL0 (N, C[[z]]) consisting of matrix functions which are\nidentity at z = 0. The set of equivalence classes of matrices F (z)Z\u03bc (z)G(z)\nunder the right GL0 (N, C[[z]]) action is clearly a principal G-bundle P\u03bc over\nC\u03bc . This G-bundle has a reduction to a principal P -bundle Q\u03bc , where P is\nthe parabolic subgroup whose quotient by the maximal unipotent subgroup\nis HC . (This reflects the fact that the gauge group is broken down to H\nnear z = 0). Explicitly, Q\u03bc consists of GL0 (N, C[[z]])-equivalence classes of\nmatrix functions F (z)Z\u03bc (z)G(z) such that G(0) \u2208 P . The group H acts by\nright multiplication. The HC -bundle we are after is the quotient of Q\u03bc .\nIn the next section, we will discuss in detail Wilson-'t Hooft line operators\nfor G = P SU(2); as a preparation, let us describe the relevant vector bundles\nover C\u03bc in the case when \u03bc is the smallest nontrivial coweight. The Schubert\ncell C\u03bc in this case is simply P1 = P SU(2)/U(1) = P SL(2, C)/B, where B is\nthe Borel subgroup of GC = P SL(2, C). The B-bundle in question is simply\nthe tautological bundle GC \u2192 GC /B, and the H = U(1) bundle is the Hopf\n18\n\n\fbundle. The coweight (resp. weight) lattice of P SL(2, C) is isomorphic to\nthe lattice of integers (resp. even integers). The electric degree of freedom\nof a Wilson-'t Hooft line operator with \u03bc = 1 and \u03bd \u2208 2Z by definition takes\nvalues in the fiber of the line bundle L associated with the Hopf bundle via\na U(1) representation of charge \u03bd. Since the Hopf bundle is the circle bundle\nof the line bundle O(\u22121) over P1 , we conclude that L = O(\u2212\u03bd).\nAs a rule, a functor from the derived category of X to itself is \"representable\" by an object of the derived category of X \u00d7 X. It is not known\nwhether this is the case for all reasonable functors, but it is certainly true\nfor functors corresponding to line operators. To show this, let \u03a3 \u2243 R2 , and\nsuppose for simplicity that the line operator has the shape of a straight line.\nUsing the \"folding trick\" we can regard the field theory on R2 with an insertion of a straight line operator as a product of two copies of the same field\ntheory on a half-plane, with a particular boundary condition. The product of\ntwo copies of a B-model with target X is a B-model with target X \u00d7 X, and\nthe boundary condition corresponds to a B-brane on X \u00d7 X. This B-brane\nrepresents the functor corresponding to the line operator. For example, in\nthe case of Wilson line operator WR (p), the corresponding object is the diagonal of MHiggs (G, C) \u00d7 MHiggs (G, C) equipped with the holomorphic vector\nbundle R(Ep ).\nThe \"folding trick\" reduces the study of line operators to the study of\nboundary conditions. There is a converse trick which reduces the study of\nboundary conditions to the study of line operators. Consider a B-model on\na strip I \u00d7 R with some boundary conditions \u03b1 and \u03b2. We can identify the \u03b1\nand \u03b2 boundaries and replace I with S 1 , with an insertion of a line operator.\nIf we think of \u03b2 as a 1-wall between our B-model and the empty theory,\nand about \u03b1 as the 1-wall between the empty theory and the B-model, then\nthe line operator is obtained by fusing together these 1-walls to get a 1-wall\nbetween the B-model and itself. We will call this the \"gluing trick\".\nOne application of the \"gluing trick\" is to produce new examples of line\noperators from known boundary conditions. Given any two B-branes on\nMHiggs (G, C) we may produce a line operator in the B-model with target\nMHiggs (G, C). However, this construction is not local on C and does not\nproduce new line operators in the twisted gauge theory. For example, if\nwe start with boundary conditions for the B-model which can be lifted to\nthe gauge theory, then \"gluing\" them produces a 3-wall in the gauge theory\nrather than a 1-wall. Only upon further compactification on C does one get\na line operator in the 2d TFT.\n19\n\n\fWe have argued above that any correlator involving a loop operator A\nand any other loop, line, or local operator depends only on the K 0 -class of\nA. It was assumed that \u03a3 = S 1 \u00d7 S 1 . One may ask if the statement remains\ntrue if \u03a3 = R \u00d7 I with suitable boundary conditions. Since the \"gluing\ntrick\" replaces any pair of boundary conditions with a line operator, the\nanswer appears to be \"yes\". But we have to keep in mind that line operators\nproduced by the \"gluing trick\" are not local on C. Therefore, to apply the\nabove reasoning we need to work with a different K 0 -group: the K 0 -group of\nthe category of all line operators in the B-model with target MHiggs (G, C).\n\n4.8\n\nThe algebra of loop operators and S-duality\n\nWe have argued above that loop operators form a commutative algebra. To\nidentify this algebra, one can use the fact that the gauge theory becomes\nabelian in the infrared, if the Higgs field has a generic expectation value\n(with all eigenvalues distinct). More precisely, the gauge group is broken\ndown to a semi-direct product of the maximal torus T of G and the Weyl\ngroup W. Loop operators in such a theory are labeled by Weyl-invariant\ncombinations of loop operators in the abelian gauge theory with gauge group\nT . The latter are labeled by electric and magnetic charges, i.e. by elements of\nHom(T, U(1)) = \u039bw (G) and Hom(U(1), T ) = \u039bcw (G). The algebra structure\nis also obvious: under Operator Product electric and magnetic charges simply\nadd up, so the algebra of loop operators is isomorphic to the Weyl-invariant\nb\npart of the group algebra of \u039bw (G) \u2295 \u039bcw (G) = \u039b(G).\nThis reasoning may seem suspect, because a vacuum with a particular\nexpectation value of a Higgs field is not BRST-invariant, and if we try to\nintegrate over all expectation values, we have to include vacua where nonabelian gauge symmetry is restored. One can give a more careful argument\nas follows. Let us consider again the case where M = \u03a3 \u00d7 C, and \u03a3 has\na nonempty boundary. From the viewpoint of the effective field theory on\n\u03a3, the theory \"abelianizes\" in the limit where the Higgs field qz is large and\nall of its eigenvalues are distinct. The problem is that one has to integrate\nover all values of qz , including those where some of the eigenvalues coincide.\nTo argue that we can perform the computation locally in the target space\nMHiggs (G, C), recall that in the B-model the path-integral localizes on constant maps. Therefore if we impose a boundary condition which keeps qz\naway from the dangerous region, we can be sure that the dangerous regions\nof the target space will not contribute. For example, one can take a boundary\n20\n\n\fcondition corresponding to a B-brane which is a generic fiber of the Hitchin\nfibration. If \u2202\u03a3 has several components, it is sufficient to impose such a\nboundary condition only on one component of the boundary.\nIt is known how the S-duality group acts on the algebra of loop operators\n[3]. The generator T, which shifts \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + 1, does not change the magnetic\ncharge \u03bc \u2208 \u039bcw (G) and acts on the electric charge \u03bd \u2208 \u039bw (G) by\n\u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + \u03bc.\nHere we regard \u03bc as an element of t\u2217 using the identification of t and t\u2217 ,\ndefined by the canonical metric\non t (the Killing metric is normalized so that\n\u221a\nshort coroots have length 2). The shift of the electric charge is due to the\nWitten effect [13]. The generator S which exchanges G and L G conjecturally\nacts by\n\u0012\n\u221a \u0013\n0 \u22121/ ng\n(\u03bc, \u03bd) \u2192 (R * \u03bc, R * \u03bd) \u221a\nng\n0\nHere R is a certain orthogonal transformation which squares to an element\nof the Weyl group [2, 14]. For simply-laced groups one can define MontonenOlive duality so that R = 1.\nThese results, however, do not yet allow us to compute the OPE of any\ntwo given Wilson-'t Hooft operator. To do that, one needs to know which\nb\nelement of the group algebra of \u039b(G)\ncorresponds to any particular Wilson-'t\nHooft operator. Recall that the space of WH operators has a natural basis\nlabeled by elements of\nb\n\u039b(G)/W\n\nSo what we are looking for is a basis for the Weyl-invariant part of the group\nb\nalgebra of \u039b(G)\nlabeled by this set.\nThe most obvious such basis is obtained simply by taking an element of\nb\n\u039b(G)\nin a particular Weyl-equivalence class and averaging it over the Weyl\ngroup. Such basis elements correspond to loop operators in the abelian gauge\ntheory with particular electric and magnetic charges.7 But this is not the\nbasis we are looking for. For example, consider a Wilson operator for an\nirreducible representation R\u03bd with highest weight \u03bd. From the viewpoint of\nthe effective abelian gauge theory, it is a sum of Wilson operators with electric\ncharges given by decomposing R\u03bd with respect to the maximal torus of G.\n7\n\nAveraging over the Weyl group reflects the fact that the gauge group is really a\nsemidirect product of the Weyl group and the maximal torus of G.\n\n21\n\n\fAll weights of R\u03bd appear in this decomposition, not just the weights which\nare in the Weyl-orbit of the highest weight. Similarly, in the phase with the\nbroken nonabelian gauge symmetry an 't Hooft operator corresponding to a\ncoweight \u03bc of G decomposes as a sum over weights of the representation L R\u03bc\nof the dual group. The explanation of this phenomenon is more subtle than\nfor Wilson operators and involves \"monopole bubbling\" [5].\nIn the case G = P SU(2) (or G = SU(2)), the desired basis is uniquely\ndetermined by imposing S-duality. To simplify notation, let us identify the\ngroup algebra of \u039bcw (P SU(2)) \u2243 Z with the space of polynomials of x, x\u22121 ,\nand the group algebra of \u039bw (P SU(2)) \u2243 2*Z with the space of polynomials of\ny 2, y \u22122 . The Weyl group acts by x \u2192 x\u22121 , y \u2192 y \u22121 . Then the algebra of WH\nloop operators can be identified with the space of Weyl-invariant polynomials\nof x, x\u22121 , y 2 , y \u22122 (for G = P SU(2)) or of x2 , x\u22122 , y, y \u22121 (for G = SU(2)). We\nknow already that the Wilson loop in the representation with highest weight\nn \u2208 Z corresponds to the polynomial\nW T0,n = y n + y n\u22122 + . . . + y \u2212n .\nHere n is an arbitrary integer if G = SU(2) and an even integer if G =\nP SU(2). Similarly, the 't Hooft loop labeled by the coweight m \u2208 Z corresponds to the polynomial\nW Tm,0 = xm + xm\u22122 + . . . + x\u2212m ,\nwhere m \u2208 Z if G = P SU(2) and m \u2208 2 * Z if G = SU(2). This is, of course,\ncompatible with the Montonen-Olive duality, which acts by\n(m, n) 7\u2192 (n, \u2212m).\nb\nMoreover, any pair (m, n) \u2208 \u039b(G)\ncan be brought to the form (m\u2032 , 0) by an\nS-duality transformation. This determines the polynomial corresponding to\nan arbitrary Wilson-'t Hooft operator for G = P SU(2) or G = SU(2):\nW Tm,n = xm y n + xm\u22122a y n\u22122b + xm\u22124a y n\u22124b + . . . + x\u2212m y \u2212n .\nHere the integers a, b are defined by the condition that m/n = a/b, a and b\nhave the same signs as m and n, respectively, and the fraction a/b is reduced.\nFor higher-rank groups, S-duality is not sufficient to fix the basis. This\nis because electric and magnetic charges need not be linearly dependent for\nhigher-rank gauge groups.\n22\n\n\fIn the next section, we will test some predictions of S-duality for the gauge\ngroup P SU(2) by a direct computation of the OPE of WH loop operators\nat weak coupling. The same method could be used to determine the OPE\nof WH loop operators for higher-rank groups, but the computations become\nvery complicated.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nOPE at weak coupling\nSemiclassical quantization of Wilson-'t Hooft operators\n\nTo compute the OPE of a pair of Wilson-'t Hooft line operators we will follow\nthe same method as in [5]. We will quantize the twisted gauge theory on a\nmanifold with boundaries C \u00d7 I \u00d7 R, with suitable boundary conditions and\nwith two insertions of Wilson-'t Hooft operators. From the 2d viewpoint, the\nboundary conditions correspond to B-branes on MHiggs (G, C). The problem reduces to the supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the space of zero\nmodes of the gauge theory. In principle, one has to study the limit where the\ntwo operators approach each other, but in the twisted theory this last step\nis not necessary, if the line operators are sitting at the same point on C.\nAs in [5], it is convenient to choose the branes so that in the absence of\nWilson-'t Hooft line operators the Hilbert space of the twisted gauge theory\nis one-dimensional. One possible choice is to take the brane \u03b1 at y = 0 to\nbe the 0-brane at a point r of MHiggs (G, C) with vanishing Higgs field. The\nbrane \u03b2 at y = 1 will be the trivial line bundle on MHiggs (G, C). Both\nof these branes are of type (B, B, B). The classical space of vacua in this\ncase consists of a single point r, with no zero modes, so the Hilbert space is\none-dimensional. Alternatively, as in [5], one could take two branes of type\n(B, A, A) intersecting at a single point. The former choice is somewhat easier,\nso we will stick to it, but in practice there is not much difference between\nthe two.\nHaving chosen the boundary conditions, we can assign to any collection\nA, B, . . . , of WH line operators the graded vector space H\u03b1\u03b2 (A, B, . . .), or\nbetter yet the corresponding BRST complex. Note that this assignment\nneed not be invariant with respect to S-duality. This is because the choice\nof branes necessarily breaks the S-duality group. Neither is this assignment\ncompatible with the monoidal structure on the category of line operators.\n23\n\n\fThat is, it is not true, in general, that H\u03b1\u03b2 (A, B) is isomorphic to\nH\u03b1\u03b2 (A) \u2297 H\u03b1\u03b2 (B).\nThis is in contrast with the situation in the GL-twisted theory [5].\nThe ultimate reason for this difference is that the twisted gauge theory\nwe are dealing with is not topological, but only holomorphic-topological.\nSuppose we fix the location of the line operator B, but vary the location of\nA on I \u00d7 C. The BRST-complex H\u03b1\u03b2 (A, B) is a differential graded vector\nbundle over I \u00d7 C with a connection along I and a \u2202 \u0304 operator along C. If\none fixes p \u2208 C and varies y \u2208 I (without colliding with B), then the BRST\ncomplexes are all naturally isomorphic. But there is no isomorphism between\ncomplexes corresponding to different p.\nIn the GL-twisted theory, one can choose all line operators to be at the\nsame point on X1 and different points on C. Because line operators are local\nalong C, the supersymmetric quantum mechanics describing this situation\ndecomposes as a product of supersymmetric quantum-mechanical systems\ncorresponding to each line operator. This implies that the quantum Hilbert\nspace also factorizes.\nIn the holomorphic-topological field theory, if we want to study the OPE,\nwe have to work with all line operators inserted at the same point on C (but\ndifferent points on X1 ), and the arguments like in the previous paragraph do\nnot apply.\nFor simplicity, let us begin with the case where all line operators are either Wilson or 't Hooft, with no \"mixed\" ones. When quantizing the theory\nat weak coupling, the roles of Wilson and 't Hooft operators are very different. 't Hooft operators directly affect the equations for the BRST-invariant\nconfigurations whose solutions determine the space of bosonic zero modes. A\nWilson operator corresponds to inserting an extra degree of freedom, which\ncouples weakly to the gauge fields, and can be treated perturbatively.\nThe first step is to ignore the Wilson operators completely. As explained\nin [5], 't Hooft operators are line operators of type (B, A, A), i.e. they can\nbe viewed either as line operators in the B-model on MHiggs (G, C), or in\nthe A-model on Mf lat (G, C). When \u03a3 is flat and has no boundary, we can\nregard the twisted gauge theory on \u03a3 \u00d7 C as a supersymmetric sigma-model\nwith (4, 4) supersymmetry. The introduction of boundaries (either of A or\nB types) breaks 3/4 of supercharges and effectively eliminates one of the\nspatial directions, so we end up with a supersymmetric quantum mechanics\n24\n\n\fwith N = 2 supersymmetry. The corresponding supersymmetry algebra has\na single complex supercharge Q satisfying\nQ2 = 0,\n\n{Q, Q\u2020 } = 2H,\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian. Q-cohomology can be identified with the space\nof supersymmetric ground states, i.e. states satisfying\nQa = Q\u2020 a = 0.\nStrictly speaking, this is guaranteed only when the target space of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics is compact. In the case of interest to us,\nthe target space is the Schubert cell C\u03bc (if there is a single 't Hooft operator), or a product of several Schubert cells, which are noncompact unless all\ncoweights are minuscule [5]. From the physical viewpoint, the correct version\nof Q-cohomology is the L2 -cohomology, and we will assume some version of\nHodge theory works for the L2 -cohomology.\nThere are two well-known kinds of N = 2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM). N = 2 SQMs of the first kind are classified by a choice of a\nRiemannian target and a flat vector bundle V over it; its space of states is the\nspace of differential forms with values in V , and the corresponding operator\nQ is the twisted de Rham differential. This is the kind of effective SQM which\nappears when considering 't Hooft operators as line operators in the A-model\n[5]. It is clear that this SQM is not suitable for the B-model, because once\nwe include the Wilson operators, the bundle over C\u03bc will not be flat. Also, in\nthe B-model the BRST operator Q is likely to be a Dolbeault-type operator.\nN = 2 SQMs of the second kind look more promising: they are classified\nby a choice of a K\u00e4hler target space and a holomorphic vector bundle over it.\nThe space of states is the space of differential forms of type (0, p) with values\nin a holomorphic vector bundle W , and Q acts as the Dolbeault operator.\nIn the next section we will perform the reduction to a SQM in some detail\nand show that in the absence of Wilson operators W is the bundle of forms\nof type (p, 0) (for any p). But we can deduce this result in a simpler way\nby making use of both A and B-models. Indeed, if we take as our boundary\nconditions branes of type (B, A, A), we can interpret the space of ground\nstates of the SQM in terms of either model. For the Dolbeault cohomology\nof W to be isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of C\u03bc , W has to be the\nbundle\n\u2295p \u03a9p,0 (C\u03bc ).\n25\n\n\fIn the presence of a Wilson line, this also has to be tensored with the holomorphic vector bundle corresponding to the Wilson line.\n\n5.2\n\nBosonic zero modes\n\nOur next task is to analyze bosonic zero modes in the presence of 't Hooft\noperators. The BPS equations are simply the Bogomolny equations, if the\nboundary conditions are suitably chosen [5]. In fact, it has been shown in [5]\nthat if in the absence of an 't Hooft operator the solution is unique, then in\nthe presence of 't Hooft operators the moduli space of solutions is C\u03bc (for a\nsingle 't Hooft operator), or a tower of several Schubert cells C\u03bci fibered over\neach other (for several 't Hooft operators). So the bosonic zero modes span\nthe tangent space to C\u03bc or its generalization. However, it is useful to have\nan explicit description of the tangent space in terms of solutions of linearized\nBogomolny equations in order to identify the fermionic zero modes.\nRecall that w = y + ix0 with y \u2208 [0, 1], x0 \u2208 R, is a complex coordinate\non \u03a3, while z is a complex coordinate on a closed Riemann surface C. For\nt = i the BRST-invariant \"holomorphic connection\" on \u03a3 is\nA = (Aw + i\u03a6w )dw + (Aw + i\u03a6w )dw\n\n(3)\n\nWe further define the \"anti-holomorphic connection\"\n\u01cd = (Aw \u2212 i\u03a6w )dw + (Aw \u2212 i\u03a6w )dw\n\n(4)\n\nand introduce corresponding covariant differentials in the adjoint representation:\nD = \u2202 + i[A, *] = D \u2212 [\u03a6, *],\n\n\u010e = \u2202 + i[\u01cd, *] = D + [\u03a6, *].\n\nNote that holomorphic and anti-holomorphic connections are related by Hermitean conjugation:\nA\u2020 = \u01cd.\nWe set background qz and q\u0303 to zero. Then it can be shown analogously\nto [5] that variations of these fields are also zero. Therefore, the complete\nset of BPS equations is obtained by setting to zero the BRST variations of\ngauginos. These are written down8 in [10].\n8\n\nIn comparing with [10] exchange z and w.\n\n26\n\n\fLet us first consider one of the \"real\" BPS equations:\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u2212 i Dw \u03a6w + Dw \u03a6w = gww g zz Fzz \u2212 i[qz , qz ] + 2gzz [q\u0303, q\u0303 \u2020 ]\n\n(5)\n\nwhere w = y + ix0 and z = x1 + ix2 . Variation of (5) gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212iDw (\u03b4\u03a6w )\u2212iDw (\u03b4\u03a6w )+[\u03b4Aw , \u03a6w ]+[\u03b4Aw , \u03a6w ] = gww g zz Dz \u03b4Az \u2212Dz \u03b4Az\n(6)\nwhere 2Dz = D1 \u2212 iD2 .

Since both \u2212\u2206C\nand \u2212\u2206\u03a3 are nonnegative operators, the kernel of the operator O must be\nannihilated by both Laplacians.

Eq. (34) has no nontrivial solutions. The proof is similar to that for\n30\n\n\foperator O above. Let us denote by O \u2032 the operator in (34).

This implies, in particular, that \u03c7z + \u03c8z\nis constant on the interval y \u2208 [0, 1]. However, such a mode is necessarily\nzero due to boundary conditions (37).\nThe result of this analysis is that fermionic zero modes span T M \u2295 T M.\nTherefore the Hilbert space of the effective SQM is the space of L2 sections\nof the vector bundle\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\u2295p \u039bp T \u2217 M \u2295 T M = \u2295p,q \u03a9p,q (M).\nFrom the formulas for BRST transformation we see that BRST variation of\nbosonic zero modes are precisely the fermionic zero modes spanning T M,\nwhile BRST variations of fermionic zero modes vanish. This means that the\nBRST operator acts as the Dolbeault operator.\n\n6\n\nOPE of Wilson-'t Hooft operators for G =\nP SU (2)\n\nIn this section we study in detail the OPE of WH loop operators in the\nspecial case G = P SU(2). The main goal is to test the predictions of Sduality explained in 4.8.\n\n6.1\n\nOPE of a Wilson and an 't Hooft operator\n\nLet us begin by considering the OPE of a Wilson and an 't Hooft operator.\nThe most naive approach is to regard an 't Hooft operator as creating a\n31\n\n\fclassical field configuration, and analyze the electric degree of freedom corresponding to the Wilson operator in this classical background. As explained\nabove, the field singularity at the insertion point of an 't Hooft operator T\u03bc\nbreaks the gauge group G = P SU(2) down its subgroup H = U(1), so it\nseems that all we have to do is to decompose the representation R associated to the Wilson operator into irreducibles with respect to H. If we label\nrepresentations of P SU(2) by an even integer n which is twice the isospin,\nand denote the magnetic charge of the 't Hooft operator by m \u2208 N, then the\nOPE at weak coupling appears to be\nTm * Wn = W Tm,n + W Tm,n\u22122 + . . . + W Tm,\u2212n .\nBut this contradicts S-duality, which requires that there be a symmetry under\nn \u2192 \u2212m, m \u2192 n. In fact, S-duality predicts that the OPE also contains contributions from WH operators with smaller magnetic charge. As explained in\n[5], this is due the \"monopole bubbling\": the magnetic charge of an 't Hooft\noperator can decrease by 2 when it absorbs a BPS monopole. Such process\nis possible because the moduli space of solutions of the Bogomolny equations\nis noncompact for m > 1; configurations with smaller magnetic charge can\nbe associated with points at infinity. The naive argument ignored monopole\nbubbling and therefore missed all such contributions.\nThis explanation also suggests that for m = 1, where the moduli space\nis simply P1 and therefore is compact, the naive argument is valid. To compare this with the S-duality predictions, we follow the procedure outlined\nin section 4.8. To the loop operators T1 and Wn one associates Laurent\npolynomials\nW T1,0 (x) = x + x\u22121 ,\n\nW T0,n (y) = y n + y n\u22122 + . . . + y \u2212n .\n\nTo the WH loop operator W T1,k one associates the Laurent polynomial\nW T1,k (x, y) = xy k + x\u22121 y \u2212k .\nWe see that\nW T1,0 (x)W T0,n (y) =\n\nn\nX\n\nW T1,n\u22122j (x, y),\n\n(40)\n\nj=0\n\nin agreement with the naive formula.\nThis example also provides a nice illustration of the difference between\nline and loop operators. Recall that the Hilbert space H(A) associated to the\n32\n\n\fline operator W T1,k is the space of sections of the differential graded vector\nbundle\nO(\u2212k) \u2297 \u2295p,q \u03a9p,q\n\nover the Schubert cell C\u03bc \u2243 P1 , with the differential being the Dolbeault\ndifferential. Here the first factor comes from the electric degree of freedom,\nand the rest comes from fermionic zero modes. Instead of this differential\ngraded vector bundle, we can think of the corresponding coherent sheaf\nO(\u2212k) \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 (P1 ) = O(\u2212k) + O(\u2212k \u2212 2).\nThe SQM Hilbert space is the Dolbeault resolution of this coherent sheaf,\nso instead of thinking about the BRST cohomology, we can think about the\ncohomology of this sheaf. Thus the sum of the WH line operators on the\nright-hand side of eq. (40) corresponds to the coherent sheaf\n(O(\u2212n) + O(\u2212n + 2) + . . . + O(n)) \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 (P1 ).\nOn the other hand, the product of a Wilson operator Wn and an 't Hooft\noperator T1 gives a trivial vector bundle of rank n + 1 over P1 , tensored with\n\u03a9\u2217 (P1 ). Clearly, the equality between left-hand side and right-hand side of\neq. (40) does not hold on the level of line operators, because\nO \u2297 Cn+1 6= O(\u2212n) + O(\u2212n + 2) + . . . + O(n).\n\n(41)\n\nBut the equality does hold on the level of K-theory.9 To see this, we will\nexhibit a filtration of O \u2297 Cn+1 whose cohomology is precisely the righthand-side of eq. (41). Recall that P1 = GC /B, where GC = SL(2, C) and B\nis the group of upper-triangular matrices with unit determinant. The fiber\nof the trivial vector bundle V of rank n + 1 carries the representation of\nGC of isospin n; for example, we can realize it by thinking of the fiber of\nV as the space of homogeneous degree-n polynomials in variables u and v,\nwhich we denote Dn (u, v). SL(2, C) acts on it by linear substitutions. To\ndefine a filtration on V , we can specify a B-invariant filtration on Dn (u, v).\nThe obvious filtration is to take Fk to be the subspace of Dn (u, v) consisting\nof polynomials of degree k or lower in u, with k ranging from 0 to n. It\nis easy to check that Fk is B-invariant for any k. Obviously, Fk /Fk\u22121 is\none-dimensional and the maximal torus of SL(2, C) acts on it with weight\n2k \u2212 n. Hence V acquires a filtration of length n + 1 whose k-th cohomology\nis O(2k \u2212 n).\n9\n\nWe are grateful to Roman Bezrukavnikov for providing the following argument.\n\n33\n\n\f6.2\n\nOPE of WH operators with minuscule coweights\n\nIn this subsection we compute the product of WH with the smallest nontrivial\ncoweights (for G = P SU(2)). The weights may be arbitrary. This case is\nvery special, because when the WH operators are not coincident, the moduli\nspace of Bogomolny equations is compact. This happens because the smallest\nnontrivial coweight of G = P SU(2) is minuscule.10 Therefore the monopole\nbubbling is absent, as discussed in [5]. The main difficulty is to determine\nthe behavior of the zeromode wavefunctions in the limit when the two WH\noperators coincide.\nLet us recall what the moduli space of Bogomolny equations looks like\nfor two noncoincident WH operators with \u03bc = 1 located at the same point\non C [5]. It is a Hirzebruch surface F2 which is a fibration of P1 over P1 .\nOne can think of it as a blow-up of the weighted projective plane WP112\nat the Z2 -orbifold point. This blow-up is associated with moving the WH\noperators apart in the y directions. Thus WP112 is the coincidence limit\nof the moduli space. The orbifold point corresponds to the trivial solution\nof the Bogomolny equations (without the monopole singularity), while the\ncomplement of the orbifold point is isomorphic to T P1 and corresponds to\nsolutions of the Bogomolny equations with one singularity of coweight \u03bc =\n\u00b12. This implies [5] that the product of two WH operators with coweight \u03bc =\n\u00b11 may contain WH operators with coweight \u03bc = \u00b12 and WH operators with\ncoweight \u03bc = 0. To understand which WH operators appear in the product,\none has to understand the zeromode wavefunctions in the coincidence limit.\nThose which remain spread-out on the complement of the orbifold point\ncorrespond to WH operators with \u03bc = \u00b12, while those which concentrate\nin the neighborhood of the exceptional divisor correspond to WH operators\nwith \u03bc = 0.\nAs explained above, the wavefunctions of the effective SQM in the presence of WH operators are square-integrable forms on the moduli space with\nvalues in a certain holomorphic line bundle which satisfy the equations\nD\u0304 \u2020 \u03c1 = 0.\n\nD\u0304\u03c1 = 0,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere D\u0304 is the covariant Dolbeault differential11 . In the coincidence limit,\nthe K\u00e4hler metric on the moduli space degenerates so that in the neighbor10\n\nThe corresponding representation of L G = SU (2) has the property that all its weights\nlie in a single Weyl orbit.\n11\nSee sections 6.3 and 6.4 for appropriate D\u0304.\n\n34\n\n\fhood of the orbifold point it becomes a flat metric on C2 /Z2 . More generally,\nwhen the WH operators are close to each other, the metric in the neighborhood of the exceptional divisor is well-approximated by a hyperk\u00e4hler metric\non the blow-up of C2 /Z2 [5]. This is because this region in the moduli space\ncorresponds to solutions of the Bogomolny equations which are trivial everywhere except in a small neighborhood of a point on C \u00d7 I (the point at\nwhich one of the WH operators is inserted). Such solutions are arbitrarily\nwell approximated by patching together solutions on R3 with the trivial solution on C \u00d7 I. Therefore the metric will be arbitrarily well approximated\nby the metric on the moduli space of Bogomolny equations on R3 , which is\nhyperk\u00e4hler.\nThe blow-up of C2 /Z2 is isomorphic to T \u2217 P1 and has a unique asymptotically flat hyperk\u00e4hler metric: the Eguchi-Hanson metric. Therefore, one\ncan produce approximate solutions of equations (42) on F2 by first solving\nthem on the Eguchi-Hanson space and on T P1 , assuming square-integrability\nin both cases, and patching them with the zero solution on the remainder of\nF2 . The solutions coming from the Eguchi-Hanson space will represent contributions to the zeromode Hilbert space from WH operators with \u03bc = 0, while\nthe solutions coming from T P1 will represent contributions from \u03bc = \u00b12.\nThe contribution to the product of WH operators coming from T P1 will be\ncalled the \"bulk\" contribution, while the one coming from T \u2217 P1 will be called\nthe \"bubbled\" contribution, because it is due to monopole bubbling. The\n\"bulk\" contribution is rather trivial and in fact can be determined without\nany computations: the magnetic charges of the singularities simply add up,\nthe same applies to the electric charges, and therefore the bulk contribution\nmust be simply\nW T2,2m+2k .\nThe \"bubbled\" contributions are much more subtle and will be determined\nbelow by solving the equations (42) on T \u2217 P1 . We will also solve the same\nequations on T P1 , not because it is required to determine the operator product, but because this computation will provide a consistency check on our\napproach, see section 6.5.\nAs a preliminary step, let us exhibit the predictions of SL(2, Z) duality\nfor the product of WH operators with coweight \u03bc = \u00b11:\nW T1,2m * W T1,2k = W T2,2m+2k + W T0,2m\u22122k \u2212 W T0,0 \u2212 W T0,2m\u22122k\u22122\n\nHere m and k are integers, and we assume m 6= k. We can simplify our\nproblem a bit by noting that by applying the T -transformation several times,\n35\n\n\fwe can reduce to the case k = 0, in which case the duality predicts that for\nm 6= 0 we have\nW T1,2m * W T1,0 = W T2,2m + W T0,2m \u2212 W T0,0 \u2212 W T0,2m\u22122\n\n(43)\n\nThe \"bulk\" contribution is as expected, while the \"bubbled\" contributions\nare far from obvious. Note that some of the coefficients are negative, unlike\nfor 't Hooft operators in [5]. This is because we are working in the K-theory\nof the category of line operators, where negative signs occur naturally.\nSimilar manipulations in the case m = 0 lead to\nT1 * T1 = T2 + T0 .\n\n(44)\n\nThis is S-dual to the fact that the tensor square of the defining representation of SU(2) is a sum of the adjoint representation (corresponding to the 't\nHooft operator T2 ) and the trivial representation (corresponding to T0 ). This\nprediction was checked in [5] for the GL-twisted theory. Briefly speaking, in\nthe GL-twisted theory we are looking for harmonic square-integrable forms\non F2 and study their behavior in the limit when F2 degenerates to WP112 .\nSince topologically F2 is the same as P1 \u00d7 P1 , and harmonic forms can be\ninterpreted in topological terms (as cohomology classes), we know a priori\nthat the dimension of the space of harmonic forms is the same as the dimension of H \u2217 (P1 \u00d7 P1 , C), which is four. It is also well-known that there is a\nunique square-integrable harmonic form on the Eguchi-Hanson space (in degree 2). Therefore the Eguchi-Hanson space contributes one state, and T P1\ncontributes three states. The latter states arise precisely from the quantization of the moduli space of the Bogomolny equations with a single singularity\nof coweight \u03bc = \u00b12. This leads to the formula (44), as predicted by S-duality.\nThe case m 6= 0 is different in two respects. First of all, we have to\nconsider forms with values in a holomorphic line bundle L. Second, the\nequations we have to solve (42) involve the Dolbeault operator rather than\nthe de Rham operator.\nTo fix L, let us use the same boundary conditions as before, i.e. assume\nthat the boundary condition on which W T1,2m acts corresponds to a particular P SU(2) bundle on C. Then the line bundle on F2 is the pull-back of\nO(\u22122m) from the base P1 . (This is because the electric degree of freedom is\nassociated, via weight 2m, with the U(1) bundle coming from the first Hecke\ntransformation and does not care about the second Hecke transformation.\nThe base P1 is the parameter space for the first Hecke transformation, while\n36\n\n\fthe fiber P1 is the parameter space for the second Hecke transformation.)\nTherefore, in the \"bulk\" part of the computation, L is simply the pull-back\nof O(\u22122m) from the base of T P1 to the total space.\nSimilarly, in the \"bubbled\" part of the computation the line bundle is a\npull-back of O(\u22122m) from the base of T \u2217 P1 to the total space. To see this,\nwe can make use of an explicit description of F2 as a K\u00e4hler quotient of C4\nby U(1)2 [5]. Let the coordinates on C4 be u, v, b, and b\u2032 . The first U(1)\naction has weights 1, 1, 2, 0, and the second U(1) action has weights 0, 0, 1, 1.\nThe moment map equations are\n|u|2 + |v|2 + 2|b|2 = 1,\n\n|b|2 + |b\u2032 |2 = d.\n\nwhere d is assumed to be positive and smaller than 1/2. These equations\nimply that u and v cannot vanish simultaneously and can be regarded as\nhomogeneous coordinates on P1 . Therefore the map (u, v, b, b\u2032 ) 7\u2192 (u, v)\ndefines a fibration over P1 . Its fiber is also a P1 with homogeneous coordinates\nb and b\u2032 . To degenerate F2 into WP112 one need to take the limit d \u2192\n1/2. The exceptional divisor is given by b\u2032 = 0. The neighborhood of the\nexceptional divisor is the subset given by b 6= 0. We can see that it is a copy\nof T \u2217 P1 by letting a = b\u2032 /b. Since u, v, a have zero weights with respect to\nthe second U(1) and since every orbit of the second U(1) action contains a\nunique representative with arg(b) = 0, we conclude that the subset b 6= 0\ncan be identified with the K\u00e4hler quotient of C3 parameterized by u, v, a by\nthe first U(1). Since the weights of these variables are 1, 1, \u22122, and u and\nv cannot vanish simultaneously, this quotient is the total space of the line\nbundle O(\u22122) over P1 , which is the same as T \u2217 P1 .\nNow, the line bundle L on F2 can be defined as the quotient of the space\nof quintuples u, v, b, b\u2032 , \u03c1 by the (C\u2217 )2 action with weights\n(1, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1), (\u22122m, 0).\nThe variable \u03c1 parameterizes the fiber of L. When we restrict to the subset\nb 6= 0, we may forget about the second C\u2217 , and replace b and b\u2032 with a =\nb\u2032 /b. Thus the restriction of L to this subset is the quotient of the space\nof quadruples u, v, a, \u03c1 by the C\u2217 action with weights 1, 1, \u22122, \u22122m. This is\nclearly the total space of the line bundle over T \u2217 P1 which is a pull-back of\nO(\u22122m) on the P1 base.\n\n37\n\n\f6.3\n\nWavefunctions on T P1.\n\nLet u, v, b be homogeneous coordinates on T P1 , with C\u2217 weights 1, 1, 2. Let\nus work in the patch u 6= 0 and define inhomogeneous \"coordinates\"\n\u221a\nv\nb\nz= , w=\n(45)\nu\nu\nWe put the word \"coordinates\" in quotation marks, because w is defined up\nto a sign and is not really a good coordinate. The good coordinate is w 2 .\nOur goal is to solve equations (42) on T P1 , i.e. to find harmonic representatives of the L2 Dolbeault cohomology groups\nH p (\u03a9q (\u22122m), T P1 ),\n\np, q, = 0, 1, 2.\n\nHere\n\u03a9q (\u22122m) = \u03a9q \u2297 O(\u22122m).\n\nThe sum of these cohomology groups is nothing but the vector space H(A),\nwhere A is the WH operator W T2,2m . In section 6.5 we will use the knowledge\nof H(A) for this and other WH operators on the r.h.s. of eq. (43) to make a\nconsistency check on our computations.\n6.3.1\n\nThe metrics\n\nWhile we do not know the precise form of the K\u00e4hler metric on T P1 coming\nfrom the Bogomolny equations, it is tightly constrained by symmetry considerations. Indeed, P SU(2) gauge transformations act on the moduli space\nby isometries which preserve the complex structure, and the orbits have real\ncodimension 1, therefore the most general ansatz will depend on functions\nof a single variable. The P SU(2) action in question acts on u, v as a twodimensional projective representation, and acts trivially on b. Using this, it\nis easy to show that the most general P SU(2)-invariant (1, 1)-form on T P 1\nis\nJ = f1 (\u03bb)e1 \u2227e1 + f2 (\u03bb)e2 \u2227e2\n\nwhere\n\ndw\ndz\n\u2212 ze2 , e2 =\nw\n1 + |z|2\nand f1 , f2 are functions of the P SU(2) invariant\ne1 =\n\n\u03bb=\n\n|w|2\n1 + |z|2\n38\n\n(46)\n\n(47)\n\n\fThe K\u00e4hler condition dJ = 0 implies f1 = \u2212\u03bbf2\u2032 so that geometry is specified in terms of a single function f2 (\u03bb) on [0, \u221e). Its behavior at zero is\nconstrained by the requirement that the metric be smooth at w = 0. Its\nbehavior at infinity is constrained by the requirement that after one-point\ncompactification of T P1 the neighborhood of infinity looks like C2 /Z2 with a\nflat metric. These two conditions are equivalent to\n1\nf or \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, f2 \u2192 const f or \u03bb \u2192 0.\n(48)\n2\u03bb\nThe standard Fubini-Study metric on WP112 corresponds to specific f1 , f2\nwith these asymptotics:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 + 8\u03bb2 \u2212 1\n( 1 + 8\u03bb2 \u2212 1)2\n\u221a\n, f2 =\nf1 =\n4\u03bb2\n4\u03bb2 1 + 8\u03bb2\nf2 \u2192\n\nLet us consider the line bundle O(n) over T P1 . The P SU(2) action on\nT P1 lifts to a P SU(2) action on O(n) if n is even, or to an SU(2) action if\nn is odd. We are mainly interested in even n. In a unitary trivialization, the\nmost general SU(2)-invariant connection on O(n) is:\n(n)\n\nA\n\n=\n\n\u2032\n\u03bbf(n)\n\nf(n)\n\nn\ne1 \u2212 ze2 ,\n2\n\nA\n\n(n)\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u2032\n\u03bbf(n)\n\nf(n)\n\ne1 +\n\nn\nze2\n2\n\n(49)\n\nand covariant differentials are defined as\nD = \u2202 + A(n) ,\n\n(n)\n\nD =\u2202+A\n\nFor n = \u22122m, m \u2208 Z the function f(\u22122m) has the following asymptotics:\nf(\u22122m) \u2192 \u03bbm\n\nf or\n\n\u03bb \u2192 \u221e,\n\nf(\u22122m) \u2192 1 f or \u03bb \u2192 0.\n\n(50)\n\nThe asymptotic at \u03bb \u2192 \u221e is chosen in such a way that the norm of the\nholomorphic section w \u22122m approaches a constant, i.e. we go to the unitary\ntrivialization\nsunit = shol (1 + |z|2 )m f(\u22122m) (\u03bb)\n(51)\n\nand require the pointwise norm |sunit |2 to approach a constant. The reason\nis that in the neighborhood of the orbifold point u = v = 0 w \u22122m represents\na section which transforms trivially between the two charts u 6= 0 and v 6= 0,\nand provides a local holomorphic trivialization of O(\u22122m). We would like\nits norm neither to diverge nor to become zero at the orbifold point. The\npostulated behavior at \u03bb \u2192 0 ensures that the connection is smooth at the\nzero section of T P1 .\n39\n\n\f6.3.2\n\nA heuristic argument\n\nSince solving partial differential equations is hard, it is useful to have some\nidea about the kind of solutions one expects to find. There is a heuristic\nargument, explained to us by Roman Bezrukavnikov, which gives the dimensions of the cohomology groups we are after. Let us start with the case m = 0\nwhere we already know the structure of solutions [5]: all of cohomology is of\ntype (p, p), and there is a single solution for p = 0, 1, 2:\nH p (T P1 , \u03a9q ) = \u03b4pq V1\nwhere V2j+1 stands for (2j + 1)\u2212dimensional irreducible representation of\nSL(2, C).\nNext we note that the line bundle O(2) corresponds to the divisor D,\nwhere D is the zero section of T P1 . Hence we have a short exact sequence of\ncoherent sheaves on T P1 :\n0 \u2192 O \u2192 O(D) \u2192 ND \u2192 0,\nwhere ND is the normal bundle of D. This gives a long exact sequence for\nsheaf cohomology groups. We are of course interested not in sheaf cohomology groups, but in L2 Dolbeault cohomology of the corresponding line\nbundles. But let us cheat and ignore this distinction. Then the long exact\nsequence implies\nH 0 (T P1 , O(2)) = V1 + V3 ,\n\nH i (T P1 , O(2)) = 0, i = 1, 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we tensor the short exact sequence with the sheaf \u03a9i , i = 1, 2,\nand then write down the corresponding long exact sequences, we infer:\nH 0 (T P1 , \u03a91 (2)) = V1 ,\n\nH 0 (T P1 , \u03a92 (2)) = 0,\n\nH i (T P1 , \u03a9j (2)) = 0, i, j = 1, 2.\n\nHaving determined all relevant cohomology groups for m = \u22121, we can\nmove on to m = \u22122 and write down a short exact sequence involving O(4) \u2243\nO(2D):\n0 \u2192 O(D) \u2192 O(2D) \u2192 ND (D),\nwhich implies\nH 0 (T P1 , O(4)) = V1 + V3 + V5 ,\n\nH 0 (T P1 , \u03a91 (4)) = V3 + V1 + V3 ,\n40\n\n(52)\n\n\fH 0 (T P1 , \u03a92 (4)) = V1 ,\nwith all higher cohomologies vanishing. Continuing in this fashion, we can\ndetermine cohomology groups for all negative m. We find that only degree-0\ncohomology is nonvanishing. If we let k = \u2212m > 0, then degree-0 cohomology groups are\nP\nH 0 (T P1 , O(2k)) = kj=0 V2j+1 ,\n(53)\nP\nP\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\n(54)\nH 0 (T P1 , \u03a91 (2k)) = V2k\u22121 + j=1 V2j\u22121 + j=1 V2j+1 ,\nP\nk\u22122\nH 0 (T P1 , \u03a92 (2k)) = j=0 V2j+1 .\n(55)\n\nIf m > 0, we can find cohomology groups by applying Kodaira-Serre\nduality to the results for m < 0:\nH p (T P1 , \u03a9q (2m)) = H 2\u2212p (T P1 , \u03a92\u2212q (\u22122m)).\n\nThus for positive m only degree-2 cohomology is nontrivial.\nBelow we write down an explicit basis for degree-0 cohomology groups\nand check that all elements of the basis are square-integrable. By KodairaSerre duality, this also verifies the predictions for degree-2 cohomology. We\nhave not been able to prove that degree-1 L2 cohomology groups vanish for\nall m. We only checked that degree-1 L2 cohomology, if it exists, does not\ncontain irreducible P SL(2, C) representations of dimensions 1 and 3. (For\nlarger P SL(2, C) representations, the analysis becomes very complicated,\nand we were not able to push it through.)\n6.3.3\n\nH 0 (T P1 , O(2k)).\n\nk > 0.\n\nFirst we find holomorphic sections of the line bundle O(2k) on T P1 . In\na holomorphic trivialization these sections are bk\u2212j P2j (u, v) for j = 0, . . . , k\nwhere P2j (u, v) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2j in variables u, v.\nFor each j these sections transform in a representation V2j+1.\nTo see that all these sections are in L2 we go to the unitary trivialization\n(51) and compute the norm. For shol = w 2(k\u2212j) z p with p \u2264 2j \u2264 2k we find\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\u03bb 2(k\u2212j)\n|z|2p dzdz\n\u03c0\n2\n2\n|sunit | f1 (\u03bb)f2 (\u03bb)e1 \u2227e1 \u2227e2 \u2227e2 =\n\u03bb\nf1 f2 f(2k)\n\u00012+2j\n2\n\u03bb\nT P1\n1 + |z|2\n(56)\n41\n\n\fwhere we used (46) and (51). The z-integral is convergent for p \u2264 2j, while\n1\nthe integral over \u03bb is finite since the integrand behaves 12 at infinity as \u03bb2j+3\nand at zero as \u03bb1+2(k\u2212j) for j = 0, . . . , k.\n6.3.4\n\nH 0 (T P1 , \u03a91 (2k)),\n\nk > 0.\n\nNext we find holomorphic sections of the vector bundle \u03a91 (2k) on T P1 .

The reason for this choice is that w \u20322m continues in the limit x \u2192 \u221e to a section\nwhich transforms trivially between the two charts u 6= 0 and v 6= 0. The behavior for x \u2192 0 ensures that we have a nonsingular metric when restricting\nto the zero section of T \u2217 P1 .\n6.4.2\n\nA heuristic argument\n\nAgain we begin with a heuristic argument. The sheaf O(2) on T \u2217 P1 can be\nidentified with O(\u2212D), where D is the zero section b\u2032 = 0. A short exact\nsequence of sheaves\n0 \u2192 O(\u2212D) \u2192 O \u2192 OD \u2192 0\n\n(64)\n\nimplies a long exact sequence for sheaf cohomology. Let us assume that it\nholds also for L2 Dolbeault cohomology. We also recall [5] that for m = 0 the\nonly square-integrable solution of equations (42) on T \u2217 P1 is of type (1, 1), so\nH 1 (T \u2217 P1 , \u03a91 ) = V1 ,\nand all other L2 Hodge numbers on T \u2217 P1 vanish. Then the long exact sequence coming from (64) and its relatives obtained by tensoring (64) with \u03a9i\nimply\nH 1 (T \u2217 P1 , O(2)) = V1 ,\n\nH 1 (T \u2217 P1 , \u03a92 (2)) = V1 ,\n\nH 1 (T \u2217 P1 , \u03a91 (2)) = V3 ,\n\nand all other cohomologies for m = \u22121 vanish. Now that we know cohomology for m = \u22121, we can tensor (64) with \u03a9i (2) and determine cohomology for\nm = \u22122, etc. In this way we obtain the following predictions for dimensions\nof L2 cohomology groups for k = \u2212m > 0:\n1\n\n\u2217 1\n\n1\n\n\u0001\n\nH T P , \u03a9 (2k) = V1 + V2k\u22121 + V2k+1 + 2\n\u0001\nH 1 T \u2217 P1 , \u03a91 (2) = V3 ,\n\nk\u22122\nX\nj=1\n\nV2j+1 ,\n\nk \u2265 3,\n\n\u0001\nH 1 T \u2217 P1 , \u03a91 (4) = V1 + V3 + V5 ,\n46\n\n\fk\u22121\n\u0001\n\u0001 X\nH 1 T \u2217 P1 , \u03a92 (2k) = H 1 T \u2217 P1 , O(2k) =\nV2j+1 .\nj=0\n\nThe results for k < 0 are obtained by Kodaira-Serre duality; in fact, from\nthe above formulas it is easy to see that cohomology groups depend only on\n|k|.\nBelow we will find exactly the right number of square-integrable solutions\nof (42) in cohomological degree 1, with the correct transformation properties\nunder P SU(2). We also checked that in degree zero (and by Kodaira-Serre\nduality, in degree 2) all L2 cohomology vanishes, just as the long exact sequence predicts. We have not been able to verify that we have found all\nsquare-integrable solutions of (42) in degree 1. We only checked that if other\nsolutions in degree 1 exist, they cannot transform in P SU(2) representations\nof dimensions 1 and 3.\n6.4.3\n\n\u0001\nH 1 \u03a91 (2k) ,\n\nk > 0.\n\nThe most general ansatz (in the unitary trivialization\n\u0001 and in the chart u 6= 0)\n1\n1\nfor the component of the (n+1)-plet in H \u03a9 (2k) with the P SU(2) isospin\nprojection J3 = \u2212(n/2) is:\n!\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf(2k)\nw\nw\n\u03c9=\nw \u2032\u22122k ae\u20321 \u2227e\u20321 + be2 \u2227e2 + c \u2032 e\u20321 \u2227e2 + d \u2032 e2 \u2227e\u20321 , (65)\n(1 + |z|2 )k\nw\nw\nwhere\na=\n\nn\nX\n\nan (x)w \u2032n\u2212p (w \u2032 z)p\n\np=0\n\n\u2032\n\ne\nand the functions b, c, d have a similar form.

Summing\nup all cohomology groups H p (T \u2217 P1 , \u03a9q (\u22122m)) with the sign (\u22121)p+q , we find\nthe \"bubbled\" contribution to the zeromode Hilbert space:\nV2m+1 \u2212 V1 \u2212 V2m\u22121 ,\nwhere V2j+1 is the 2j + 1-dimensional representation of P SL(2, C). This\ncorresponds to the sum of Wilson loops\nW2m \u2212 W0 \u2212 W2m\u22122 ,\nin precise agreement with the S-duality prediction (43).\nAs a consistency check on our computation, let us consider the Euler\ncharacteristics of the graded vector spaces H(A, B, . . .) associated to the the\nleft-hand side and right-hand side of eq. (42). According to our computations, the \"bulk\" contribution to the Euler characteristic of the right-hand\nside is\n1 + (2m + 1) \u2212 (2m \u2212 1) = 3.\nThe \"bubbled\" contribution is\n(2m + 1) \u2212 1 \u2212 (2m \u2212 1) = 1.\n52\n\n\fTherefore the Euler characteristic of the right-hand side is 4. We can compute\nthe Euler characteristic of the left-hand side by moving the WH operators\nso that they are inserted at the same point on the interval I but at different\npoints on C.14 If the WH operators are inserted at different points on C,\nthe space of zero modes factorizes, and so does the Euler characteristic. The\nHilbert space H(W T1,0 ) is purely even and two-dimensional. The Hilbert\nspace H(W T1,2m ) is\n\u22951p,q=0 H p (P1 , \u03a9q (\u22122m)),\nand its Euler characteristic is 2 for any m. Therefore the Euler characteristic\nof the left-hand side is also 4.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, 't Hooft line operators can be interpreted\nmathematically as objects of the category of equivariant perverse sheaves on\nthe affine Grassmannian GrG . Then the algebra of loop operators can be\nidentified with the K-theory of this category, and the S-duality prediction is\nequivalent to the geometric Satake correspondence. 't Hooft loop operators\nlabeled by coweights of G define a distinguished basis in the K 0 -group.\nIt was suggested by R. Bezrukavnikov that the algebra of Wilson-'t Hooft\nloop operators can be similarly interpreted as the K 0 -group of the equivariant derived category of coherent sheaves on a certain subset \u039bG of the\ncotangent bundle of GrG . \u039bG is defined as the union of the conormal bundles to the Schubert cells in GrG and is invariant under the left G[[z]] action\non GrG . Just like GrG parameterizes Hecke transformations of holomorphic\nG-bundles, \u039bG parameterizes Hecke transformations of Higgs bundles. Thus\nany object of the G[[z]]-equivariant derived category of \u039bG can be used to\ndefine a functor from the derived category of MHiggs (G, C) to itself and can\nbe thought of as a line operator. It was proved in [15] that the K 0 -group of\nb\nb\nDeq\n(\u039bG ) is the Weyl-invariant part of the group algebra of \u039b(G),\nin agreement with the physical arguments. Further, it was conjectured in [15] that\nb\nthe obvious invariance of \u039b(G)\nunder the exchange of G and L G comes from\n14\n\nUnlike in [5], there is no natural flat connection on the sheaf of the zeromode Hilbert\nspaces H(A, B, . . .), and in principle the stalk of this sheaf might depend on the locations of the insertion points. Nevertheless, while the dimensions of the individual graded\ncomponents might jump, the Euler characteristic must be constant.\n\n53\n\n\fb\nb\nan equivalence between categories Deq\n(\u039bG ) and Deq\n(\u039bL G ). From the physical\nviewpoint, this conjecture means that the categories of line operators for G\nand L G are equivalent and thus follows from the S-duality conjecture.\nNote also that the physical definition of the Wilson-'t Hooft loop operator\nb\nsuggests that there is a distinguished basis in the K-theory of Deq\n(\u039bG ) lab\nbeled by elements of \u039b(G)/W,\nand that the S-duality group acts on this basis\nin a natural way. The mathematical significance of this basis remains unclear. Moreover, Wilson-'t Hooft line operators should correspond to some\nb\ndistinguished objects in Deq\n(\u039bG ). It was conjectured by R. Bezrukavnikov\nthat these distinguished objects are certain perverse coherent sheaves on \u039bG .\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank R. Bezrukavnikov, A. Braverman, S. Gukov, M.
