At weak coupling a perturbative treatment is\namenable, however the strong coupling dynamics represents an incredible challenge. It is\nbelieved that this regime can be understood in terms of a string theory. This correspondence has been made more precise for a certain class of gauge theories over the past decade,\nthrough the use of gauge/gravity duality [1].\nIt is known that the dynamics of gauge theories differs significantly depending on\nwhether or not they contain fields in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.\nOne of the most obvious features of having such fields is that there is the possibility of\nforming bound states. At weak coupling these bound states appear as positronium, i.e. a\nsystem analogous to the hydrogen atom but composed of a quark and an antiquark. In\norder to probe the strong coupling dynamics of flavored gauge theories, it is interesting to\nstudy these objects at large \u03bb, where \u03bb is the 't Hooft coupling. A very natural tool to\nadopt is that of gauge/gravity duality. However including fundamental matter is a difficult\nproblem. A step forward was taken in [2, 3, 4, 5], were it was suggested to introduce flavor\n\n2\n\n\fas a new open string sector coming from an extra stack of branes (so-called 'flavor' branes)\nintersecting the color branes. In the limit in which the number of flavor branes is so small\nthat they can be considered a small perturbation, we can perform the geometric transition\nand replace the color branes by their near horizon geometry - where we should consider\nthe flavor branes as probes. This sort of quenched approximation has a number of consequences, one of which is that the running of quarks in loops is absent. This translates, in\nparticular, into a vanishing beta function for the gauge coupling. However, in the case of\nmassive flavors, the conformal symmetry is broken in the IR, leading to the existence of\n\"mesons\". These bound states were studied for the first time in [6] (for reviews see [7, 8]).\nIt is only very recently that fully backreacted solutions, corresponding to an unquenched\napproach, have been found in [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nIn this paper we will be interested in the strong coupling structure of these mesons.\nFollowing the approach in [15], we will probe them with photons. As anticipated, in\nthe approximation we will work on, the beta function for the gauge coupling vanishes.\nThen, it is to be expected the large momentum transfer regime of the scatterings we wil be\ncomputing, which is insensitive to the IR relevant mass term, to be controlled by conformal\ninvariance. Related processes have been considered in the literature using a gravity dual\nfor QCD, such as [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], and also [25, 26] where gravitational\nform factors have been computed. Note that in our case, the gravity dual captures the\nstrong coupling regime of the theory. Thus, as opposed to real QCD, in our case the large\nmomentum transfer regime will be dominated by a strongly coupled conformal theory.\nThe fact that conformal invariance is recovered in the UV is translated into an appropriate\ndictionary which allows to use the scaling coming from naive parton counting valid at weak\ncoupling, along the lines of [27, 28, 15].\nIn order to study the mesons, we will consider the simplest theory admitting a gravity\ndual and containing a mass gap, which can be engineered as a D3-D7 intersection in flat\nspace.3 In more adequate terminology, we will be computing electromagnetic transition\nform factors. This requires to couple the gauge theory to electromagnetism, however\nfrom the point of view of the SU (Nc ) dynamics, the U (1)EM is just a global symmetry.\nTechnically this allows us to consider the EM current as a U (1) subgroup in the SU (Nf ),\ncorresponding to the gauge field on the flavor brane.4 This will require us to find the\nadequate couplings in the meson effective theory, allowing us to compute the desired form\nfactors. Note that in [15] the vector field probing the mesons was the full SU (Nf ). After\nintroducing the field theory and its gravity dual in section 2, we derive the corresponding\ninteraction lagrangian allowing us to compute such form factors in section 3. In section\n4 we compute and analyze these transition form factors. In accordance with the results\nin [15], we are able to match the expectations from QCD at large momentum transfer.\nThis is to be expected since, in that regime, both QCD and our theory are dominated\nby conformal invariance. Interestingly we can make use of the interaction lagrangian to\n3\n\nThe massless limit of this theory was considered in [29], where quark scattering is computed along the\nlines of [30]. It would be interesting to apply these methods to the massive (non-conformal) case.\n4\nFor example, this approach is similar to that in [31].\n\n3\n\n\fcompute the process \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0. As opposed to the form factors, this case is more contrived\nand we do not have a fully satisfactory field theory picture. On the other hand, this process\nwill be related to the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0\u03c1 form factor due to vector meson dominance in much the same\nspirit as in QCD. In section 5 we examine the full amplitude, in which the analog of the\nhadronic tensor exhibits a Callan-Gross relation. This is deeply connected with the helicity\nstructure of our amplitudes. We finish in section 6 with some comments and suggestions\nfor future directions.\n\n2\n\nThe field theory and its gravity dual\n\nThe theory in question consists of N = 4 SYM coupled to Nf fundamental hypermultiplets\nin such a way that the final theory preserves N = 2 supersymmetry. Generically the\nhypermultiplets will be massive, and we will assume a diagonal mass matrix. It is important\nto note that our theory is non-chiral even in the massless limit. In particular this means\nthat the flavor symmetry is just SU (Nf ). The field content is\n\n\u03a6I\nQi\nQ\u0303i\n\nSU (Nc )\nAdj\n\u0003\n \u0304\n\u0003\n\nSU (Nf )\n1\n \u0304\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\nand the superpotential reads\nW = Q\u0303i (mq + \u03a63 )Qi + \u03a6I \u03a6J \u03a6K \u000fIJK ,\n\n(1)\n\nThe \u03a6I , I = 1, 2, 3 are the 3 chiral superfields of the N = 4 SYM sector, whilst the\n(Q, Q\u0303) flavor hypermultiplets break the supersymmetry down to N = 2. The mass term\nadditionally breaks the U (1)R symmetry. Let us set mq to zero for a moment. In that\ncase there is an R-symmetry under which RQ = R\u03a6I = 23 . 5 Assuming we are close\nto a conformal fixed point, we can compute the exact beta function of the theory by\napproximating \u03b3i \u223c 3Ri \u2212 2. It is then straightforward to see that\n\u03b2gY M =\n\nd 8\u03c0 2\n= \u2212Nf .\nd log \u03bc gY2 M\n\n(2)\n\nThus we see that the theory is not asymptotically free, but rather develops a Landau pole\nin the UV. However we will treat the theory in the large Nc limit. The beta function for\nthe 't Hooft coupling reads\n\u03b2\u03bb =\n\nd\n8\u03c0 2\nd 8\u03c0 2\nNf\n=\n=\u2212\n.\n2\nd log \u03bc gY M Nc\nd log \u03bc \u03bb\nNc\n\n(3)\n\n5\nThis R-charge assignation is the one coming from a-maximization, and is indeed the one adapted to\nmatch the beta function coming from the gravity description (see for example [32], or [33] for a discussion\nwith D7 branes).\n\n4\n\n\fTherefore in the limit in which we have a large number of colors and a finite number of\nflavors in such a way that Nf /Nc \u223c 0 we can still make sense of the theory since it becomes\nconformal. In the generic case in which there is a mass term, since it has a classical negative\nbeta function, the UV properties will not be changed from those of the massless case, and\nwe expect that our theory approaches a UV conformal point provided we are in the limit\nNf /Nc \u223c 0. Note that even though the gauge coupling has a vanishing beta function,\nconformal invariance will be broken in the IR by the scale set by mq .\nIt is important to note that in the Nf /Nc \u223c 0 limit, non-perturbative effects will be\nnegligible. For example, the ADS superpotential gives no contribution, since the exponent\nof the meson matrix is zero.\nLet us finally discuss the global symmetries. The theory has an SU (2)R \u00d7 SU (2) global\nsymmetry, of which the SU (2)R is an R-symmetry (and therefore does not commute with\nthe supercharges), whilst the other SU (2) is a global symmetry. As noted above in the\ncase of massless hypermultiplets the R-symmetry is enhanced back to SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)R .\n\n2.1\n\nThe gravity dual\n\nThe theory above can be engineered as a brane web. Consider the D3-D7 intersection\naccording to the following array:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nNc D3 : \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nNf D7 : \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nWorking at small 't Hooft coupling, upon taking the decoupling limit, the local dynamics\non the D7-branes decouples and appears as a global flavor symmetry in the effective 4dimensional field theory description. This field theory is precisely the one introduced above.\nThe 3-3 strings give rise to the N = 4 SYM fields, while the 3-7 strings generate the flavor\nhypermultiplets. 6\nWithout loss of generality let us localise the D3-branes at the origin of the (8, 9) plane.\nThen\nthe i-th such D7-brane will sit at a point ~zi = (xi8 , xi9 ), which is at a distance Li =\np\ni 2\n(x8 ) + (xi9 )2 . This distance, in units of 2\u03c0\u03b10 , defines the mass of the i-th hypermultiplet.\nHowever, for simplicity, we will assume that all the masses are equal, corresponding to a\nconfiguration where all the D7 are in a single stack located at ~z = (x8 , x9 ). In that case\nwe recover the full SU (Nf ) flavor symmetry with mq = L/(2\u03c0\u03b10 ).\nWe can provide a closed string description of the system which captures the strong\ncoupling regime of the theory by considering the gravity dual of the above system. In\nthe Nc /Nf \u223c 0 limit the backreaction of the D7-branes is negligible. Then, an accurate\ndescription of the system can be achieved by considering Nf probe D7 in the near horizon\nof the background sourced by the Nc D3-branes. The background is then simply AdS5 \u00d7S 5\nwhich has a constant dilaton, translating into a vanishing beta function for the gauge theory\n't Hooft coupling in agreement with our discussion above.\n6\n\nNote that the 7-7 strings are non dynamical in the gauge theory.\n\n5\n\n\fIn order to describe the flavor D7 embeddings, we can write the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 metric as\n~x2 + ~z2 2\nR2\ndx\n+\n(d~x2 + d~z2 ) ,\n(4)\n1,3\nR2\n~x2 + ~z2\nwhere ~x = (x4 , * * * , x7 ). Working in static gauge, the D7-branes will have as worldvolume\ncoordinates (x1,3 , ~x), whilst sitting at fixed ~z2 = L2 . It is now straightforward to write the\ninduced metric on them in polar coordinates as\nds2 =\n\nds2D7 =\n\n(r2 + L2 ) 2\nR2\n(dr2 + r2 d\u03a923 ) ,\ndx\n+\n1,3\nR2\n(r2 + L2 )\n\n(5)\n\nAs usual, the radial coordinate on the D7 will have the interpretation of holographic energy.\nWe can now see how at large r, corresponding to the UV of the field theory, the metric\napproaches AdS5 \u00d7S 3 . Additionally, since the 't Hooft coupling is constant, we see that the\ntheory approaches a conformal fixed point in the UV. However in the IR, the metric above\ndeviates from pure AdS because of the presence of the IR scale L. Since mq = L/(2\u03c0\u03b10 )\nwe see that conformal invariance is lost because of the scale mq , which introduces a mass\ngap in accordance with the field theory analysis above.\nFrom the supergravity we can also read off the resulting R-symmetry of the field theory.\nThe ~x coordinates on the D7 enjoy an SO(4) \u223c SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) symmetry. However the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background also has a 4-form RR potential which can couple to the D7. Indeed\nthe symmetry which interchanges the two SU (2) is broken by the Chern-Simons term on\nthe D7-branes. Therefore one of the SU (2) becomes the SU (2)R while the other remains\nas the global symmetry SU (2). In the case of massless quarks, the D7 sit on top of the D3branes and therefore we recover rotational invariance in the (8, 9) plane, which corresponds\nto the U (1)R .\n\n3\n\nEffective meson theory from SUGRA\n\nSince our theory is not conformal in the IR we expect it develops a mass gap, generating a\nmeson spectrum. At weak coupling these mesons are positronium-like systems, however we\nare interested in their strong coupling description. In order to investigate this we should\nanalyze the 3-7 strings corresponding to the quark fields, but in the dual gravity description which captures the strong coupling. As we have argued before, after the geometric\ntransition the strong coupling gravity dual is in terms of Nf probe D7 in the near-horizon\nof the D3 background. Quarks, therefore, correspond to strings hanging from the flavor\nbranes, and quark bound states, i.e. the mesons we want to study, will correspond to 7-7\nstrings. One can see that these 7-7 strings fall into two distinct sectors: large macroscopic\nspinning strings corresponding to mesons with large spin; and small strings captured by the\nflavor D7 fluctuations corresponding to spin 0,1 mesons. These mesons were first studied\nin [6].\nThe\n\u221a mass of the low spin mesons with arbitrary quantum numbers M is of order mM =\n1\nmq / \u03bb, as opposed to the mass of the high spin mesons which is at least of order mM \u03bb 4 .\n6\n\n\fTherefore in the strong coupling regime we see that higher spin mesons are much more\nmassive than low spin mesons. This hierarchy allows us to concentrate on DBI mesons\nwhilst forgetting about the more stringy large spin states. Therefore for the mesons of\ninterest, the spectrum can be computed by considering fluctuations, up to quadratic order,\nof the DBI+CS action of the probe flavor branes. Let us consider our D7 to be localised\nat ~z = (L, 0) where the scalar fluctuations will be ~z = (L + \u03a61 , \u03a62 ). In order to have\ncanonical mass dimensions we must re-scale the field to \u03a6i = 2\u03c0ls2 \u03c7i . Additionally, we have\nto take into account the fluctuations of the gauge field on the D7. After considering the\nquadratic expansion for the flavor branes action, one can see that the scalar wavefunction\ncorresponding to a field of mass mn,l is given by (see [6] for example)\n2m2q\n(n + l + 1)(n + l + 2) ,\n(6)\n\u03c7i = e \u03a6M (r)Y ;\n=\n=\n\u03bb\nwhere Y l is the S 3 spherical harmonic which specifies the SU (2)R \u00d7SU (2) quantum numbers\nof the meson ( 2l , 2l ). The function \u03a6M is a radial function with quantum numbers M =\n{n, l} given by\npf x\n\nl\n\nm2M\n\nm2n,l\n\nl\n\n\u03a6M = \u03a6n,l =\n\nw2\nl\n\n(1 \u2212 w) 2\n\n2 F1 (\u22121\n\n\u2212 l \u2212 n, 2 + l + n, l + 2, w) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we have introduced the coordinate w defined through\nr2\nw\n=\n;\nw \u2208 [0, 1] .\n(8)\n2\nL\n1\u2212w\nFrom the asymptotic behavior of this mode one can see that it is dual to a scalar\noperator of conformal dimension \u2206 = l + 3, which schematically reads\n(Q\u0303\u03a6l Q)\u03b8\u03b8\u0304 = \u03c8\u0303Q\u0303 \u03c6l \u03c8Q + * * * ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c8Q , \u03c8\u0303Q\u0303 are the fermions in the Q, Q\u0303 supermultiplets and \u03c6 is the scalar in \u03a6.\nFrom the eigenmodes of the vector field on the D7-brane we get a tower of massive\nspin-1 \u03c1 mesons whose wavefunctions are (again see [6] for more detail)\n2m2q\n(n + l + 1)(n + l + 2) ;\n(10)\n\u03bb\nwhere the polarization vector satisfies the gauge condition \u000f * p = 0. The Y l is the l-th\nspherical harmonic specifying the SU (2)R \u00d7 SU (2) ( 2l , 2l ) representation, whilst \u03a6II\nM is a\nradial function with quantum numbers M = {n, l} given by\nl\n\u03c1\u03bc = \u000f\u03bc epx \u03a6II\nM (r)Y ;\n\nm2M = m2n,l =\n\nl\n\n\u03a6II\nM\n\n=\n\n\u03a6II\nn,l\n\n=\n\nw2\nl\n\n(1 \u2212 w) 2\n\n2 F1 (2\n\n+ l + n, \u22121 \u2212 l \u2212 n, l + 2, w) .\n\n(11)\n\nThis wavefunction corresponds to a spin-1 operator of conformal dimension \u2206 = l + 3\nschematically given by [15]\n7\n\n\f(Q\u2020 \u03a6l Q \u2212 Q\u0303\u03a6l Q\u0303\u2020 )\u03b8\u03b8\u0304 = q \u2020 \u03c6l \u2202 \u03bc q \u2212 q\u0303\u03c6l \u2202 \u03bc q\u0303 \u2020 + * * * ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere q, q\u0303, \u03c6 stand for the lowest (scalar) components in the Q, Q\u0303, \u03a6 supermultiplets.\nBoth the scalar and vector meson modes correspond to normalizable fluctuations. However, we can construct the non-normalizable fluctuations starting from the same equation\nof motion. In particular we will be interested in the vector field non-normalizable mode\nsince, as clear from (12), the l = 0 case reduces to the flavor current. This current is a\nglobal symmetry, exactly as EM is to QCD. Therefore we will refer to the \"photon\" as\nthe non-normalizable mode arising from the vector field on the D7-branes. The flavor\nsymmetry is SU (Nf ), but we will choose some U (1) subgroup as our electromagnetic current. Therefore we will neglect the non-abelian dynamics on the D7-branes. From this\nperspective our theory essentially reduces to that of a single flavor D7 brane. The explicit\nform of the non-normalizable mode is given by [15]\nA\u03bc = \u03c7\u03bc eqx A(r)Y 0 ,\n\n\u03c7*q =0 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we keep explicit the (trivial) S 3 dependence through Y 0 . However since this spherical\nharmonic is a constant we will drop it in our computations. Also note that\ns\nq2\u03bb\n1\n\u03c0\u03b1(1 + \u03b1)\n\u03b1 = (\u22121 + 1 \u2212 2 ) .\n(14)\nA=\n2 F1 (\u2212\u03b1, 1 + \u03b1, 2, w) ,\nsin(\u03c0\u03b1)\n2\nmq\nBy expanding the effective DBI+CS action on the D7-branes to higher orders it is\npossible to obtain the interacting terms of the meson effective field theory. It is to be\nexpected that each such term in that effective field theory is suppressed by extra powers of\nNc . Therefore we will keep the lowest order terms at which we find the desired interaction\nvertices as the main contribution to the process in which we are interested. In our particular\ncase we want to probe the internal structure of mesons with photons. Since our photon\nactually comes from the non-normalizable mode of the vector field on the brane, the lowest\norder interactions will come from terms in the expansion of the DBI+CS which involve\ntwo (not necessarily identical) mesons plus a gauge field, which we will interpret as the\nEM current. Clearly at least one of the mesons should be a vector meson in order to\ncontract the indices of the EM current, so from this point of view, it is clear that we will\nfind interaction vertices allowing us to compute scalar-vector transition form factors. We\nwill confirm this by direct computation.\nDBI action:\nStarting with the DBI lagrangian for the D7-brane, it is convenient to parametrize the\nfluctuations in terms of the matrix \u000f in such a way that the DBI reads\nZ p p\n1\n~ J\u03a6\n~ + 2\u03c0\u03b10 FLJ ) ,\n(15)\nS = \u2212T7 r3 \u011d det(1 + \u000f) ; \u000fIJ = g IL (h 2 \u2202L \u03a6\u2202\n\n8\n\n\f\u221a\nHere capital latin indices run over the worldvolume coordinates of the D7, and \u011d is the\ndeterminant of the internal unit S 3 . Note that any overall factors of the warp factor cancel\nout because of having D7-branes. It is important to stress that the fluctuation metric g\n~ Therefore\ndepends on the warp factor h, which explicitly depends on the fluctuations \u03a6.\neven though we will expand in powers of \u000f, at each order a further expansion of g is implicit.\nTo lowest order we find that\np\n1\n1\n1\ndet(1 + \u000f) = 1 + T r(\u000f) \u2212 T r(\u000f2 ) + (T r(\u000f))2 + . . .\n(16)\n2\n4\n8\nClearly, the linear term will not contribute. From the quadratic terms, to lowest order\nin the implicit expansion of g, we will obtain the quadratic action leading to the above\nwavefunctions. However we will also get extra terms, which in particular contain the\ninteraction lagrangian\n\ni\nSDBI\n\n2L(r2 + L2 )\nLR4\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b2\n\u03a6\nF\nF\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n+\n\u03a61 Fri Frj \u011d ij\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\n2\n2\n3\n4\n(r + L )\nR\no\n2\n2\nL(r + L )\n+\n\u03a61 Fij Fkl \u011d ik \u011d jl .\n(17)\nR4\n\nZ p n\n\u011dr3\n= \u2212T7 (2\u03c0\u03b1 )\n0 2\n\nHere latin indices run over the S 3 , while greek ones are along Minkowski directions.\nOne can convince oneself that higher orders in the expansion of (16) will contribute to\nhigher point functions, so the expansion in (16) is indeed enough for our purposes.\nIn the interacting lagrangian we will assume that one of the field strengths corresponds\nto a non-normalizable gauge field. By inspecting the non-normalizable mode above, it is\nclear that the only contribution will come from the first term - which in turn requires the\nother field strength to be that of the massive vector field. 7 Therefore, the vertex on which\nwe will focus is\nZ p n\no\nLR4\ni\n0 3\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b2\n\u03c7\nF\nF\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u011dr3\n,\n(18)\nSDBI = \u2212T7 (2\u03c0\u03b1 )\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(r2 + L2 )3\nwhere we have extracted the 2\u03c0\u03b10 factor in \u03a61 to write the lagrangian explicitly as a\ncoupling to \u03c71 .\nAs advertised, our interaction involves a photon, a vector meson and a scalar meson.\nThis structure is deeply connected with the fact the flavors (and therefore the mesons)\ncome from fluctuations of a D7-brane. In the brane theory the scalars, being real, will not\nexhibit minimal coupling to the vector field. Instead the elements we have to play with\nare field strengths and derivatives of scalars. We may have wondered if we could get a\nform factor with the same meson for in and out states. However it is clear that we cannot\nachieve this, since that particular interaction could only come from F\u03bc\u03bd times some tensor\n7\n\nThe vector field on the D7 actually come in 3 modes, out of which we concentrated on the only one\nwhich has spin 1. The other modes correspond to scalar fields, and one can convince oneself that they do\nnot couple to the interacting lagrangian above.\n\n9\n\n\fmade out of the derivatives of the field, and this vanishes by antisymmetry. It is worth\nnoting that if we include a background antisymmetric field, such as a magnetic B field or\na worldvolume instanton (going to the Higgs phase of the theory [34, 35]), this restriction\ncan be avoided. It would certainly be interesting to compare this with our results, which\nare essentially probing the Coulomb branch of the theory.\nCS action:\nThe AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background has a non-zero 4-form potential whose electric component\nis given by\nC (4) =\n\n\u03c14\ndx0 \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 .\nR4\n\nwhere \u03c12 = r2 + ~z2 .\nThe relevant coupling in the CS of the flavor D7 is now\nZ\n2\u03c0T7 \u03b10\nC (4) \u2227 F \u2227 F .\n2\nwhich we can integrate by parts to write as a function of the G(5)\nZ\n2\u03c0T7 \u03b10\nA \u2227 G(5) \u2227 F .\n2\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nwhere we denote by G(5) the 5-form field strength derived from C (4) , and A is the worldvolume vector field whose corresponding field strength is F . After some algebra one can\nsee that\nr4\n\u03c93 \u2227 dx8 \u2227 dx9 + r3 x8 dr \u2227 \u03c93 \u2227 dx9 \u2212 r3 x9 dr \u2227 \u03c93 \u2227 dx8\nG\n4\n(22)\nSince (20) contains two factors of the gauge field, the lowest order which contributes to\nour interaction vertex will come from a term in G(5) containing just one factor of the scalar\nfluctuation. Clearly this can only arise from the last two terms, where the pull-back of G(5)\nforces us to select the fluctuation through its derivative along the Minkowski directions. It\nis not hard to convince oneself that finally the relevant CS contribution is\n\u221a\nZ\n2T7 (2\u03c0\u03b10 )2 R4 L\nr3 \u011d\ni\nSCS =\nA \u2227 d\u03a62 \u2227 F .\n(23)\n3\n(r2 + L2 )3\n(5)\n\n4R4\n=\n3(r2 + (L + \u03a61 )2 + \u03a622 )3\n\n\u0012\n\nRecalling that d\u03a62 actually stands for the derivative along the Minkowski direction, and\nextracting the 2\u03c0\u03b10 dependence from \u03a62 , we can integrate this by parts to get\n\u221a\nZ\no\nT7 (2\u03c0\u03b10 )3 R4 L\nr3 \u011d n\ni\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\nSCS =\n\u03c7\nF\nF\n\u000f\n.\n(24)\n2 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd\n3\n(r2 + L2 )3\n10\n\n\u0013\n\n\fThe lagrangian above demands us to interpret \u03c72 as a pseudoscalar, since otherwise the\neffective meson theory would violate parity. In the UV theory we can set the \u03b8 angle to\nzero, which is dual to taking the RR scalar C (0) to zero. 8 Since in the Nf /Nc \u223c 0 limit\nall non-perturbative corrections are switched off, we would not expect any source of parity\nviolation; which demands us to consider \u03c72 as a pseudoscalar.\nWe can provide an additional motivation for this assignment by assuming that the D7~ = (L1 , L2 ). It is then straightforward to repeat\nbranes are localised at a generic point L\nthe computation above and show that the full interacting lagrangian (DBI+CS) actually\nreads\ni\n\n0 3\n\nS = T7 (2\u03c0\u03b1 ) R\n\n4\n\n\u221a\no\nr3 \u011d n ~\n1~\n\u03b1\u03bc \u03b2\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n;\nL*\u03c7\n~ V F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b7 \u03b7 + L * \u03c7\n~ A F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03bc\u03bd \u000f\n~ 2 )3\n3\n(r2 + L\n\nZ\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c7\n~ V = (\u03c71 , \u03c72 ) and \u03c7\n~ A = \u000fij \u03c7i = (\u03c72 , \u2212\u03c71 ). Thus we see that the sign of the\nCS term actually depends on the choice of skewness of the (8, 9) directions. We can\nconsider the interacting lagrangian above just at the level of pure field theory, and suppose\nnow that under a parity transformation ~x \u2192 \u2212~x we should also consider the combined\ntransformation\n(L1 , L2 ) \u2192 (L2 , L1 )\n(\u03c71 , \u03c72 ) \u2192 (\u03c72 , \u03c71 )\n\n(26)\n\n~ *\u03c7\n~ *\u03c7\nUnder this transformation it is clear that L\n~ V behaves as a scalar, whilst L\n~ A picks an\nextra minus sign compensating the minus sign picked up by F F\u0303 . Therefore the transformation (26) allows for conserved parity.\nWe would like to heuristically motivate it yet another way. We could start with the\nSUGRA background and impose ~x \u2192 \u2212~x as a symmetry. Clearly the metric is left invariant, however the electric part of the 5-form field strength picks up a minus sign. Since\nG(5) must be self-dual we have to ensure that its magnetic part also picks a minus sign.\nBy inspection of (22) one can achieve this by reversing the skewness of the (8, 9) plane.\nWhen looking at the linearization of the 5-form one can check that it indeed reduces to\n(26). If we now choose the particular vacuum L1 = 0, L2 = L we see that effectively it is\nlike considering \u03c71 as a scalar and \u03c72 as a pseudoscalar.\n\nThe final interaction lagrangian which we will be using reduces to\ni\n\n0 3\n\nS = \u2212T7 (2\u03c0\u03b1 ) LR\n\n4\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\no\n1\nr3 \u011d n\nA\n\u03c1\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b2\nA\n\u03c1\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c7\n(F\n)\n(F\n)\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n+\n\u03c7\n(F\n)\n(F\n)\n\u000f\n,\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\n2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(r2 + L2 )3\n3\n(27)\n\n8\n\nEven if we took a pure gauge but non-vanishing C (0) , it would not couple to this order; suggesting\nthat indeed our effective lagrangian is insensitive to the parity-violating sector of the theory.\n\n11\n\n\fwhere we have added the superscripts A and \u03c1 to remind the reader that one of the field\nstrengths corresponds to the non-normalizable field dual to the photon, while the other\ncorresponds to the in/out \u03c1 meson state.\nIt is important to note the difference in the measure with respect to the form factors\ncomputed in [15]. The additional suppression by (r2 + L2 )\u22121 will be crucial in order to\nget the expected large q 2 behavior of our form factors. One can heuristically understand\nthis dependence in much the same spirit as how we motivated the scalar-vector-photon\nvertex. Because of the DBI+CS structure, as discussed, this is the lowest order term we\ncould have. Additionally since the scalar appears without derivatives, it could only come\nfrom the expansion of a term schematically of the form hF 2 . In order to get a single\npower of the scalar it should appear in the combination L\u03a6 in order to have dimensions\nof (length)2 , however on dimensional grounds, each time this combination appears it must\nbe suppressed by an extra power of the other dimensionful quantity in the theory, namely\nthe combination r2 + L2 . Therefore an extra suppression on (r2 + L2 )\u22121 with respect to\n[15] is to be expected.\n\n4\n\nEM transition form factors at strong coupling\n\nArmed with the interacting lagrangian (27) we can now turn to the actual problem of\ncomputing the electromagnetic form factors. As we discussed, we have to understand \u03c71\nas a scalar and \u03c72 as a pseudoscalar. Even though this pseudoscalar is not the pseudoGoldstone boson of any broken chiral symmetry, we will call it \u03c0 0 , since at least its effective\ncouplings are identical to those of the neutral pion. 9 In turn, the scalar behaves as a scalar\nneutral meson such as the f0 (or \u03c3).\nGenerically, the situation we will consider is that in figure (1), where the momenta are\nchosen so that p + q = p0 .\n\n\u03b3\u2217\nq\np!\n\np\n\nf0 , \u03c0 0\n\n\u03c1\n\nM = (m, l! )\n\n!\u03bc , N = (n, l)\n\nFigure 1: Transition form factors for \u03c0/f0 \u2212 \u03c1 mesons\nMaybe it would be more convenient to call it \u03b7 0 , since our theory does not have a chiral non-abelian\nsymmetry but has an approximate UV chiral U (1)R .

If we go to the rest frame of the vector meson the form factor\nreduces to\nh\ni\ni\nh\nhf0 |J \u03bc |\u03c1i \u223c m\u03c1 \u2212 q 0 \u000f\u03bc \u2212 (q * \u000f)\u03b4\u03bc0 = m\u03c1 \u2212 q 0 \u000f0 \u03b40\u03bc \u2212 q 0 \u000fi \u03b4i\u03bc + q 0 \u000f0 \u03b40\u03bc = \u2212m\u03c1 q 0 \u000fi \u03b4i\u03bc . (33)\nWe might now choose to align ~q with the z direction. Current conservation requires then\nthat q\u03bc hf0 |J \u03bc |\u03c1i = 0, which in turn implies that ~\u000f = (\u000fx , \u000fy , 0); explicitly showing that the\npolarization of the vector meson is transverse. Therefore, only the vector part of \u000f gives\na non-zero contribution to the transverse part of the off-shell current, reflecting the fact\nthat the transition is between a spin 0 and a spin 1 state, and thus should involve the spin\n1 part of the current.\nFor later purposes, let us note that, in the Breit frame where p~ + p~0 = 0, we will find\nthat all the momenta are of order q 2 . 10 In that case, we see that roughly speaking, the\nlarge q 2 behaviour of the matrix element will be given by In,m,l (q 2 )q 2 .\nIn that frame p~0 = \u2212~\np = 2q~ , and we may choose ~q = (0, 0, q). A boost along the z direction connects\nthis frame with the rest frame of the vector meson. Since in the rest frame \u000f = (0,~\u000f\u22a5 , 0), the vector meson\nwill be also transverse in the Breit frame. If we have ultra-relativistic hadrons, q0 \u223c 0, then p = ( |~2q| , \u2212 2q~ ),\np0 = ( |~2q| , 2q~ ), q = (0, ~q).\n10\n\n13\n\n\f4.2\n\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 transition form factor\n\nIt is also straightforward to evaluate the CS interaction term. It reads\n\u03c0\u03c1\nh\u03c0 0 , M |J \u03bc |\u03c1, \u000f, N i = Fn,m,l\n\u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u000f\u03bd q\u03b1 p0\u03b2 ;\n4\n\u03c0\u03c1\nT7 (2\u03c0\u03b10 )3 LR4 In,m,l (q 2 ) ;\nFn,m,l\n=\n3\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nwhere In,m (q 2 ) is the same integral (30) as above. One can check that also current conservation is satisfied and q\u03bc h\u03c0 0 , M |J \u03bc |\u03c1, \u000f, N i = 0.\nAgain we can go to the rest frame of the vector meson where\nh\u03c0 0 |J \u03bc |\u03c1i \u223c m\u03c1 \u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03b10 \u000f\u03bd q\u03b1 \u223c m\u03c1 \u000f\u03bcij0 \u000fi qj\n\n(36)\n\nand we again see that only the vector part of the polarization of the vector meson is\ninvolved - and therefore only the spin 1 part of the current is involved in the interaction.\nNote that again, in the Breit frame, the magnitude of the whole matrix element for\nlarge q 2 will be of the order In,m,l (q 2 )q 2 . We also point to the results obtained in [16, 17,\n18, 19, 20, 20] for the form factor, albeit in a slightly different set-up.\n\n4.3\n\nq/~x dependence of the form factors\n\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\u03c3\u03c1\nBy inspection of the two form factors, we have that Fn,m,l\n= 32 Fn,m,l\n. Since in addition\n\u03c3\u03c1\nFn,m,l \u223c In,m,l , we will loosely identify In,m,l with the form factors of interest. The fact\nthat both form factors are proportional one to the other should be due to SUSY, since\nboth the two scalars are in the same N = 2 massive supermultiplet.\nIn order to go further, we should study In,m,l . Following the method suggested in [15],\nwe can do the j-th integration of A with respect to w - which we will call aj . Recall that A\nis a function of the photon momentum, so for integration we must recall that aj = aj (w, q 2 ).\nDenoting by F the rest of the hypergeometric functions under the integral in (30), we can\niteratively integrate this by parts to obtain\n\nZ\nIn,m,l =\n\nZ\nAF =\n\n\u2202 \u03c9 a1 F =\n\n(a1 F )|w=1\nw=0\n\n=\n\n(a1 F )|w=1\nw=0\n\nZ\n\u2212\n\na1 \u2202 \u03c9 F =\n\n\u2212\n\n(a2 \u2202\u03c9 F )|w=1\nw=0\n\nZ\n+\n\na2 \u2202\u03c92 F = * * * . (37)\n\nIt can be easily checked that aj |w=0 = 0. The crucial observation then is that only a finite\nnumber of derivatives of F are non-vanishing when evaluated at w = 1. We find that the\nlast non-zero derivative is the jmax = 2l + n + m + 3. Analogously one can check that the\nfirst non-zero derivative is the jmin = l + 2. This way we see that indeed\njmax\n\nIn,m,l =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)j aj+1 (q 2 ) \u2202wj F ;\n\njmin\n\n14\n\n(38)\n\n\fwhere both aj+1 and \u2202wj F are evaluated at w = 1. By iteration one can, in principle,\ndetermine the value of the integral by obtaining all the higher order coefficients.\nWe could take a seemingly different approach and make direct use of VMD (see appendix\nA). It is possible then to rewrite (30) as\nIn,m,l\n\nmax\nm2q kX\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0\n=\n;\n\u03bb k=0 q 2 + m2k,0\n\nZ\nRn,l,m,l,k,0 =\n\nr3\nII\n\u03a6m,l \u03a6II\nn,l \u03a6k,0 ,\n(r2 + L2 )3\n\n(39)\n\nwhere Rn,l,m,l,k,0 is proportional to the coupling constant between hadrons with the specified quantum numbers, and fk,0 is the decay constant of the vector meson with quantum\nnumbers (n, l = 0). A priori k in (39) should take values in the range k \u2208 [0, \u221e). However\nit can be checked that Rn,l,m,l,k,0 = 0 for k > kmax , with kmax = 2l + n + m + 2, which\ntruncates the sum and ensures its finiteness. Additionally we should point out that the\nminimal k depends on the particular choice of (n, m). For example, for n = m the sum\nextends all the way down to k = 0.\nExpression (39) should coincide with (38). However, it has a compelling interpretation\nsince it explicitly allows us to see the dependence on the decay and coupling constants.\nIndeed expression (39) is the manifestation of VMD in gauge/gravity duality. It allows\nus to regard the photon-hadron interaction as a photon going into a vector meson which\nis indeed the one which interacts with the hadrons, in accordance with the vector meson\ndominance principle. The pictorial representation is in figure (2).\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n=\n\n!\n\nf\n\u03c1int\n\nR\n\n\u03c1int\n(f0 , \u03c0 0 )M\n\n(f0 , \u03c0 0 )M\n\n\u03c1N\n\n\u03c1N\n\nFigure 2: Vector meson dominance.\nIt should be pointed that even though VMD naturally falls out in the gravity construction, universality does not generically hold. See [36] for further details on this.\nThe necessary agreement between (39) and (38) requires some, a priori, non-obvious\nrelation between masses, decay constants and coupling constants. We will make explicit\nuse of some of these properties below.\nIt is expected that form factors in position space carry information about the charge\ndistribution of the hadrons. This interpretation is most straightforward for diagonal form\nfactors (i.e. form factors in which the in meson is identical to the out meson). However\nin the case of off-diagonal form factors (transition form factors) we could think of it as the\ndistribution of charge at the interaction point.\nThere are, however, subtleties in how one should extract this kind of information in\nposition space from a form factor computed in momentum space. For example, in a non15\n\n\frelativistic system the 3-dimensional Fourier transform of the form factor with respect\nto ~q would give the spatial charge distribution. However since our mesons have a very\nhigh binding energy, one should expect our system to be highly relativistic. It has been\nargued in [15] that, in order to have the right probabilistic interpretation (as well as a\nconnection to generalized PDF, see for example [37, 38, 39]), it is natural to switch to\nthe large momentum frame, and interpret the photon as probing the transverse structure\nof the hadron. As suggested in [15], we might then consider aligning the initial hadron\nmomentum along the z direction, and boosting the system to large momentum along it.\nThen choosing q = (0, ~q\u22a5 , 0) we can perform a 2-dimensional Fourier transform\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n2\ni~\nq\u22a5 ~\nx\u22a5\nf (q) ; F T2 2\n= K0 (mk,0 r) ,\n(40)\nd ~q\u22a5 e\nF T2 f (q) =\n2\u03c0\nq + m2k,0\nwhere K0 (x) is the corresponding Bessel function. The function obtained by means of this\n2d Fourier transform should be interpreted as a charge density in the transverse space\nparametrized by the transverse radius r. Restricting to the case at hand we have, from\n(39)\nIn,m,l\n\nmax\nm2q kX\n=\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 K0 (mk,0 r) .\n\u03bb k\n\n(41)\n\nIn the case of diagonal form factors, one possible definition of the size of the hadron is\nhr2 i = 4\n\n\u2202\nFdiag (q 2 )|q2 =0 ,\n\u2202q 2\n\n(42)\n\nwhere the factor of 4 accounts for the fact that this is a transverse (2-dimensional) charge\ndistribution. We will use this definition and interpret it as a measure of the size of the\nregion where the interaction takes place. Then using (39) we have, for the \u03c3\u03c1 transition\nform factor\n2\ni\nhr\u03c3\u03c1\n\n0 3\n\n= 8T7 (2\u03c0\u03b1 ) LR\n\n4\n\nm2q \u03bb\u22121\n\nkX\nmax\nk\n\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,k,0\n.\nm4k,0\n\n(43)\n\nUnfortunately we have been unable to explicitly perform the above sum.\n2\n2\nFinally let us note that, from the relation between F \u03c3\u03c1 and F \u03c0\u03c1 , we have hr\u03c3\u03c1\ni = 23 hr\u03c0\u03c1\ni,\nwhich follows trivially from the definitions of the two form factors.\nLarge q 2 behavior:\nLet us concentrate on the large q 2 behavior of (30). The j-th integration of A, aj ,\nbehaves like\n\u0010 m2 \u0011j+1\nq\naj \u2192 4j j!\n.\n\u03bbq 2\n\n16\n\n(44)\n\n\fIt is clear that the large q 2 behavior of (30) will be controlled by the first non-zero derivative\nof F at w = 1 (at w = 0 aj vanishes) since it will be the least suppressed term. As\nanticipated, the first non-zero derivative is the l + 2. Therefore we see that at large q 2 , the\nintegral (30) runs like\nIn,m \u2192 Cn,m,l\n\n\u0010 m2 \u00113+l\nq\n\u03bbq 2\n\n= Cn,m,l\n\n\u0010 m2 \u0011\u2206\nq\n\n\u03bbq 2\n\n,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere Cn,m,l is a numerical coefficient depending on n, m, l. Note that the q 2 dependence is\ncompletely independent of n, m, and just relies on the conformal dimension of the operators\ninvolved. This is connected to the fact that the theory flows to a UV conformal point and\nso we see that conformal invariance alone governs the structure of the form factors.\nWe could just as well use the alternate expression (39). Expanding (39) for large q 2 we\nhave\nIn,m,l \u2192 In,m,l\n\n\u0011\nm2q X (\u22121)j \u0010 X\n2j\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 (mk,0 )\n.\n=\n\u03bb j (q 2 )j+1 k\n\n(46)\n\nWe can re-write this as\n\nIn,m,l \u2192 In,m,l =\n\nX\nj\n\n\u221a\n\u0010 m2 \u0011j+1 \u0010 1 X\n\u03bb mk,0 2j \u0011\nq\n)\n(\u22121) 4 j!\nf\nR\n(\n,\nk,0\nn,l,m,l,k,0\n\u03bb q2\n4j j! k\nmq\nj j\n\n(47)\n\nso we conclude that the coefficients in (38) can be written as\n\u2202wj F |w=1\n\nkmax\n1 X\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0\n= j\n4 j! k\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb mk,0\nmq\n\n!2j\n.\n\n(48)\n\nThis allows us to write the leading term for large q 2 fixing the Cn,m,l above\nIn,m,l \u2192 (\u22121)\n\nl+2\n\nmax \u0010\n\u0010 kX\n\u0011\u0010 m2 \u0011\u2206\n\u03bb m2k,0 \u0011(l+2)\nq\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0\n.\n2\nmq\n\u03bbq 2\nk\n\n(49)\n\nSince from (38) we know that the first non-zero term is that with 1/(q 2 )l+3 , we conclude\nthat\nX\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 (mk,0 )2j = 0 \u2200j < l + 2 .\n(50)\nk\n\nThis is an important constraint on the algebraic structure. For later purposes, let us\nconsider the function (r 6= 0)\nX\nmk,0 r\nhj (r) =\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 (mk,0 )2j log(\n),\n(51)\n2\nk\n17\n\n\fTaking its r derivative we have\ndhj (r)\n1X\n\u223c\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 (mk,0 )2j ;\ndr\nr k\n\n(52)\n\nso that by using (50) we see that when j < l + 2, hj is actually a constant.\nLet us analyze the form factor in position space. As argued above in order to have\na sensible physical interpretation we must boost the system to the infinite momentum\nframe and assume q = (0, ~q\u22a5 , 0). Then we will Fourier transform to obtain a function of\nthe transverse size r. The large q 2 region corresponds to small r. Expanding (41) and\nre-writing it in a suitable form, we see that for r \u223c 0\nm2q X X fk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 \b\nmk,0 r \u0001\n\u03c8(j)\n\u2212\nlog\nIn,m,l \u2192 \u221a\n22j j!\n2\n\u03bb k j\n\nmk,0 r\n\n\u00012j\n\n,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03c8(j) are numerical coefficients depending on j. The term dominating the sum above\nwill be the one with the lowest exponent for r. Using (50) and the fact that hj is constant\nfor any j < l + 2, we conclude that, up to a constant (which on physical grounds must be\nzero), the small r dependence in transverse space is\n\u03c3\u03c1\n\u03c0\u03c1\nFn,m,l\n\u223c Fn,m,l\n\u223c In,m,l \u223c r2(l+2) log r \u223c (r2 )\u2206\u22121 log r ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere we have re-written the r power in terms of the conformal dimension of the operators\ninvolved. Note that the scale in position space at large q 2 is set by 1/ml+2,0 .\nGeneral behavior going towards the IR:\nLet us now analyse the IR behaviour, i.e. the small q 2 region. In position space this\ncorresponds to the asymptotically large r region. From the asymptotic behavior of the\nBessel function we see that\n\nIn,m,l\n\n\u221a 2\n\u221a 2\n\u03c0mq X\n\u03c0mq\ne\u2212mk,0 r\ne\u2212mk\u0302,0 r\nfk,0 Rn,l,m,l,k,0 \u221a\n\u223c \u221a\nfk\u0302,0 Rn,l,m,l,k\u0302,0 \u221a\n.\n\u2192 \u221a\nmk,0 r\nmk\u0302,0 r\n2\u03bb k\n2\u03bb\n\n(55)\n\nWhere k\u0302 is the lowest k for which Rn,l,m,l,k,0 does not vanish. As we pointed out, this\nminimal k\u0302 depends on the particular choice of (n, m), which in turn sets the scale 1/mk\u0302,0\nof the measured charge distribution in position space for small q 2 .\n\n4.4\n\nField theory expectations for the transition form factors\n\nAs we have discussed, the UV of our theory is described by a conformal point. Therefore\nwe expect the large q 2 behavior of our form factors to be controlled purely by conformal\ninvariance, in much the same way as in QCD - where asymptotic freedom is responsible for\nthe vanishing beta function at large q 2 . However in that case the theory is weakly coupled\n18\n\n\fand one can make use of perturbative tools to study the behavior of diverse processes at\nlarge q 2 [40, 41] (see [42] for an exhaustive review).\nRather than looking directly to form factors, it is useful to consider the full matrix\nelement, i.e. taking into account the scaling of the tensor structure.11 In the Breit frame,\nwhere all the momenta are of order q, we can identify the q-dependence of our matrix\nelement (recall equation (36)) as\nh\u03c0 0 , f0 |J \u03bc |\u03c1i \u223c\n\n1\n(q 2 )\u2206\u22121\n\n.\n\n(56)\n\nOn the other hand, for a conformal field theory at weak coupling, the expected scaling for\nthe transition form factor between a hadron h1 of helicity s1 and a hadron h2 of helicity s2\nis [42]\nhh1 , s1 |J \u03bc |h2 , s2 i \u223c\n\n1\nq 2n\u22123+|s1 \u2212s2 |\n\n;\n\n(57)\n\nwhere n is the number of partons. Additionally, (57) requires us to impose the selection\nrule that current helicity is given by \u03bb = s1 + s2 . We can can heuristically understand\nthis formula in a free parton model. Assume that h1 , h2 are composed of n partons, each\ncarrying a fraction of the total momentum q of the hadron. The off-shell photon would\nstrike one of them which, in the Breit frame, forces the struck parton to recoil. Since we\nare looking into elastic processes, for the hadron not to break we require the struck parton\nto emit a gluon to force the other partons to recoil. After power counting in this naive\nparton model it is easy to see that one recovers (57).\nFrom (57) it is also clear that form factors in which helicity change is involved are\nsuppressed by additional powers of q [43, 44]. It is easy to understand this in the naive\nparton model. The reason is that the vector boson vertex does not change helicity unless\nthe partons are massive. In that case helicity flipping processes are suppressed by an extra\npower of m/q.\nThe discussion above is not limited to weak coupling, since in the end the is tied to\nconformal invariance (i.e. naive dimension counting as if the beta function was zero).\nIndeed, it can be extended to strong coupling by replacing n by the twist of the lowest\ntwist operator capable of creating both hadrons [27, 28]. In the case at hand we have a\nspin 0 hadron (conformal dimension \u2206) whose twist is \u03c4S=0 = \u2206, and a spin 1 hadron\n(conformal dimension \u2206) whose twist is \u03c4S=1 = \u2206 \u2212 1. Even though \u03c4S=1 is smaller, the\nlowest twist operator capable of creating both hadrons has \u03c4 = \u2206. Thus we can extend\n(57) to strong coupling by replacing n \u2192 \u2206.\nIt remains to discuss the helicities of the in and out hadrons. We saw that in both the\n0\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 and f0 \u2212 \u03c1 cases the transition was purely transverse. This means that s1 = 0 for\nthe f0 /\u03c0 0 while s2 = \u00b11 for the \u03c1. According to the selection rule this implies that the\npart of the current involved in the transition is the \u03bb = \u00b11 part, which is indeed what\n11\n\nFor example, our matrix elements are schematically I(q 2 ) \u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 q\u03b1 q\u03b2 \u223c I(q 2 ) q 2 .\n\n19\n\n\fwe found (we will see additional consequences of this when we study the full amplitude).\nTherefore on general grounds, we expect the matrix element to scale like\nhh1 , s1 |J \u03bc |h2 , s2 i \u223c\n\n1\nq 2\u2206\u22123+1\n\n=\n\n1\n(q 2 )\u2206\u22121\n\n,\n\n(58)\n\nwhich is indeed the scaling we obtained.\nNote that in order to get this precise scaling the extra suppression by (r2 +L2 )\u22121 in (27)\nis crucial. At this point it is instructive to compare with the form factors computed in [15].\nFor simplicity let us consider the spin 0 case in that paper. 12 The corresponding integral\nleading to the form factor was very similar to (30), but without the extra suppression by\n(r2 + L2 )\u22121 . This has the non-trivial effect of making the matrix element scale with an\nextra power of 1/q \u22121 (technically it is due to the fact that the first non-zero derivative of\nthe equivalent F would appear one order beyond). On the other hand these form factors\nare between spin 0 states, and thus we expect that the extra suppression due to helicity\nflip in (58) to be absent. This justifies the extra power of 1/q \u22121 . We can now re-analyse\nthe appearance of this form factor in view of these results. The scalars of the theory are\nreal implying that there will be no minimal coupling to the vector field on the brane. Thus\nthe only possible trilinear combination is the one we obtained which, due to dimensional\nreasons, requires the extra suppression with (r2 + L2 )\u22121 .

Note\nthat, in fact, we could switch the scalar with the pseudoscalar here, and the calculation\nproceeds in exactly the same fashion albeit with an additional factor of 2/3.

We can cross-check this result by using the\n22\n\n\fiterative integration method of section 4. We would like to note that it is straightforward\nto reapeat a similar computation with the scalar meson getting the same result up to a\nnumerical factor.\nIt is instructive to consider the corresponding process with a vector meson as the final\nstate, i.e. the process \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c1. This can be obtained from (5.43) in [15] if we assume the\nphoton is valued in SU (N ).

Therefore when both photons and\n\u2217\nvector meson are polarised in the transverse direction, we find that F \u03b3 \u03c1 \u223c 1/(q 2 )2 .\nLet us return to the pseudoscalar (or scalar) case (\u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 0 or \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c3) assuming one photon with large virtuality and the other almost on-shell. We found that the form factor\nscales like 1/q 6 . This scaling is different to that obtained in QCD, where the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 form\nfactor goes like 1/q 2 . In principle one would expect these two results to match due to\nconformal invariance. Nevertheless, the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 is more subtle than the form factors discussed above. In pQCD (perturbative QCD) it is dominated by the one-quark propagator\n(see for example [42]), which in turn arises from the fact that the \u03c0 meson is a 2-quark\nbound state. By comparison with the case of the form factors, we see that in order to\ncompare weak coupling results with strong coupling results one needs, at least13 to replace\n\u03c4 \u2194 n. As opposed to the form factors, in the case at hand the fact that the selection rule\nsets l = 0 obscures the identification of \u03c4 . However we can perform the integrals above\nbefore taking l = 0. One can see that, considering (60), in order to have a well-behaved\nintegral we have to restrict ouselves to even values of l. Under that assumption, one can\ncheck that I\u02c6 \u223c 1/q l+6 , which upon taking l = 0 coincides with the result obtained using\nVMD. Since l has to be even, we can re-write it as l = 2l0 in such a way that the integral\n0\ngoes like 1/(q 2 )l +3 . Defining a new twist operator \u03c4 = l0 + 3, the actual behavior of the\nintegral in which we are interested is 1/(q 2 )\u03c4min , where \u03c4min is the minimal twist, i.e. the\none corresponding to l = l0 = 0. One could also consider the vector meson case for generic\n0\n(again even) l, which goes like 1/q l+4 . In terms of l0 this reads 1/(q 2 )l +3\u22121 . Define now\n\u03c4 = l0 + 3 \u2212 1, where the \u22121 stands for the fact that we have a spin 1 meson. Then the\nintegral goes again like 1/(q 2 )\u03c4min . Note how in this case the different suppression factor\n(r2 + L2 ) in the integrand, is crucial to obtain the extra factor of q which allows to interpret the exponent as a spin 1 hadron. Thus we see that the integral actually scales like\n1/(q 2 )\u03c4min for both the vector and scalar cases. The \"twist\" is defined in terms of half of the\nl corresponding to the actual meson state (the factor of 3 is related to the dimensionality\nof the \"basic\" l = 0 state, and it seems reasonable that it should be kept). This suggests\nThe \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 channel is more sensitive to details of the theory than the form factors. It might be that\nour theory, being non-perturbatively trivial, simply has a different structure than QCD.\n13\n\n23\n\n\fthe identification \u03c4min \u2194 nmin /2, where nmin is the minimal number of valence partons\nin a QCD hadron (i.e. 2 for a meson). Then upon using this dictionary, the form factor\nwould scale like 1/q 2 , which is precisely the QCD result. However we must warn the reader\nthat we do not have any compelling explanation for this identification.\nThis process has been recently considered [46] in the context of the hard wall model of\n[47], obtaining that the large q 2 behavior of the form factor matches that of QCD. However\nin that case the model is designed to capture the same symmetries as low energy QCD, so\nit is expected a good agreement.\n\n5\n\nThe complete unpolarized amplitude and inclusive\nprocesses\n\nIt is interesting to compute the complete amplitude for the processes above. The physical\nprocess which we are actually looking at is really either e\u03c0 0 \u2192 e\u03c1 or ef0 \u2192 e\u03c1 (or its\ncrossed channel).

Interestingly in both cases\nthe tensor structure leads, after summing over polarizations, to a Callan-Gross relation\nbetween the \"structure functions\" (see appendix B). This should come as no surprise. We\n24\n\n\fexplicitly saw how the transverse character of our transitions was responsible for the large\nq 2 behavior of the form factors. The fact that we recover Callan-Gross scaling here is\nanother consequence of having a transverse transition. 14\nSummarizing our results;\nf0 meson as in state:\nF1n,m,l =\n\nq4\n(F \u03c3\u03c1 )2 ;\n4x2 n,m,l\n\nF2n,m,l =\n\nq 4 \u03c3\u03c1 2\n) .\n(F\n2x n,m,l\n\n(73)\n\n\u03c0 0 meson as in state:\nF1n,m,l =\n\n4x2 m2\u03c1 \u0001 \u03c0\u03c1 2\nq4\n1\n+\n(Fn,m,l ) ;\n4x2\nq2\n\nF2n,m,l =\n\nq 4 \u03c0\u03c1 2\n(F\n) ;\n2x n,m,l\n\n(74)\n\nwhere we indicate the quantum numbers of the (pseudo)scalar n and vector meson m,\nwhich share the same l. Note that the x above is the Bjorken x, which in our quasielastic\ncase is fixed eventhough we will keep it as open.\nThe results above are quite reminiscent of DIS (Deep Inelastic Scattering) structure\nfunctions. Summing over possible final states we can construct an inelastic scattering\namplitude. However we have to remember that our computation does not allow for the\nproduction of high spin states. Therefore if we want to interpret our results in terms of\nDIS we have to restrict ourselves to a regime in which the production of such states is\nhighly suppressed. These high spin states are much more massive than the low spin states\nwe have been considering in this paper. Therefore if we consider the DIS experiment in\nwhich we have a final state with N particles (in our theory to leading order in \u03bb\u22121 N = 1)\nwhose 4-momenta add to W , whilst the initial hadron h and off-shell photon have momenta\nrespectively p and q - we have the trivial relation W = p + q. Squaring this we find\n1\n(75)\nW 2 \u2212 m2h = q 2 (1 \u2212 ) .\nx\nSince we don't want to allow for final state masses much larger than the initial state\nmass, we should only consider DIS in the region where we take q 2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and x \u2192 1 in\nsuch a way that W 2 \u2212 m2h remains finite and small. Thus we see that we could only access\nthe x \u223c 1 (i.e. quasi-elastic) regime of DIS. In principle it should be possible to connect\nthe threshold regime of the DIS with the form factors. At weak coupling this was studied\nin [48, 49], however at strong coupling one must be more careful since the calculation\nproceeds slightly differently [28]. Generically one would expect\nF2DIS \u223c F2F orm F actor G(q 2 (1 \u2212 x\u22121 )) .\n\n(76)\n\nHowever a detailed discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of the current work.\n14\n\nWe thank G. Gabadadze for pointing this out to us.\n\n25\n\n\f6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have been concerned with the structure of quark-antiquark bound states\n(mesons) at strong coupling. In order to study them we have probed these mesons with an\nexternal electromagnetic field. Together with the results [15, 27], the picture that emerges\nis that the large q 2 behaviour of the matrix elements is dominated entirely by conformal\ninvariance.\nThis provides some justification as to why the scaling at weak coupling, based on a naive\nparton model, extrapolates to the strong coupling regime upon the replacement n \u2194 \u03c4 . In\nthe particular cases we have studied the helicity dependence of the matrix elements appears\nin a very explicit manner. The U (1) form factors we computed are non-vanishing in the\nlarge N limit, only for different in and out hadrons (i.e. they are transition form factors).\nAs we pointed out earlier, this is determined by the precise structure of the SUGRA\nlagrangian. It also follows from the index structure and reality of the worldvolume fields\non the brane, that the transitional form factors involve fields of different spin. Therefore the\nhelicity dependence of the matrix elements appears in an explicit manner. The necessary\npowers of q 2 , required to account for the helicity change in the amplitude, have a precise\nSUGRA origin in that they arise from terms that are suppressed by additional powers of\nthe warp factor.\nWe can imagine a way in which a different structure could arise. Refs. [34] and [35]\nstudied the Higgs phase of the theory, in which the quarks have a non-trivial VEV and\ntherefore the theory has a different vacuum structure. In the gravity side this is achieved\nby means of a worldvolume instanton on the flavor branes (in order to go to the Higgs\nbranch of the N = 2 theory one needs at least two flavors - see for example [7]). In the\npresence of the instanton, we could imagine new interaction operators emerging such as\nir\nA \u03bc\n\u2202i \u03a6Finst\nFr\u03bc\n\u2202 \u03a6 . This term would capture a form factor for \u03a6. Therefore studying the\nmeson structure in the Higgs branch, and comparing it with what it was obtained in the\nCoulomb branch could be very interesting.\nBy using the same tools, we computed the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 form factor. However, in that case\nthe comparison with the QCD result is more obscure. A priori it looks like our scaling is\ncompletely different (1/q 6 as oposed to 1/q 2 ) from that in QCD. Alerted by the experience\nwith the form factors, where the strong/weak coupling matching in the light of conformal\ninvariance demands \u03c4 \u2194 n, we provided a first attempt of such a map by computing the\nform factor for generic l. Eventhough the matching requires some unjustifyied identification, we feel that it should be possible to have a deeper understanding of the particular\nscaling we obtained in the light of conformal invariance. We leave that issue open for future\nwork. A consequence of gauge/gravity duality is that it satisfies VMD due to the (rather)\ngeneric properties of Sturm-Lioville operators. Since both the gauge field and the vector\nmeson come from the same PDE, as described in appendix B, VMD follows directly. This\n\u2217\nallows us to relate F \u03b3 \u03c0 with F \u03c1\u03c0 in very much of the same spirit as in QCD - where VMD\nalso holds\nThere are a number of things which could be studied further. One is to understand the\nconnection with inclusive processes (in particular DIS). It should be possible to compute\n26\n\n\fDIS amplitudes directly in this model. One could consider computing the current-current\ncorrelator using a given hadron and non-normalizable mode wavefunctions, by employing\nthe usual AdS/CFT methods. Understanding the Bjorken x behavior of the DIS and\ncomputing the actual behavior of G in (76) to compare with [28] would be very interesting\nand would surely shed more light on the structure of the mesons.\nAnother extension of our work could be to study the structure of the hadrons at high\ntemperature. It has been suggested that these mesons could play an important role in the\ncontext of the QGP (see for instance [50] or [51] and references therein) In the Minkowski\nphase of [52] mesons still exist. It would be interesting to study the structure of the hadrons\nin that phase by probing them with photons. We expect the large q 2 behavior should not\ndiffer too much from the zero temperature result, since at q 2 \u001c T 2 one would expect to\nrecover conformal invariance. However the IR behaviour will differ substantially. It would\nbe interesting to check whether the relations between F \u03c1\u03c0 and F \u03c3\u03c1 continue to be valid,\nand if any new form factors appear. A naive analysis in the light of our computations\nseems to suggest that there will be no modifications along these lines.\nFinally we note that another way of getting vertices allowing for the same meson to\nappear as in and out state, could be obtained by considering a pure gauge B-field along\nthe Minkowski directions - in much the same spirit as in [53]. There are a number of things\nwhich could be studied this way, for example one could study the emission of photons\nby mesons in an external magnetic field. Interestingly in this case, even at zero mass\nthe theory develops a condensate which breaks the U (1)R symmetry. It would be very\ninteresting to check if one can reproduce more accurately the QCD \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c0 behavior in this\ninstance.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to G.

MOIF-CT-2006-38381.\n\nA\n\nA brief review of VMD in gauge/gravity\n\nThe hypothesis of vector meson dominance (VMD) [54] regards the photon-hadron interaction at low energies in terms of an intermediate vector meson (see [55] for a review).\nIn our D3-D7 model, the mode dual to the EM current corresponds to the nonnormalizable mode of the worldvolume U (1) gauge field on the flavour brane with l = 0.\nRestricting to the sector with l = 0, both normalizable (i.e. vector mesons with l = 0)\nand non-normalizable (i.e. EM current) modes come from solving the same PDE. This\nequation was first written down in [6]. Writing \u03a8 = eiqx \u03c8, where \u03a8 stands for either\n\n27\n\n\fnormalizable or non-normalizable mode, it can be recast in terms of w as follows\nw R4 q 2 2\n\u2202 \u03c8=0,\n(77)\n1 \u2212 w L2 \u03bc\nFor generic q 2 we would obtain the non-normalizable mode, whilst the normalizable mode\nappears when q 2 = m2n,0 . Let us now define\n\u0001\n\u2202w 4w2 \u2202w \u03c8 \u2212\n\n\u0001\nL\u03c8 = \u2202w 4w2 \u2202w \u03c8 ;\n\nR4 q 2\n;\nL2\n\n\u03bbq =\n\n\u03c1=\n\nw\n;\n1\u2212w\n\nL\u0303\u03c8 = L\u03c8 \u2212 \u03bbq \u03c1\u03c8 ;\n\n(78)\n\nin such a way that the equation for the non-normalizable modes is just L\u0303A = j upon taking\nj = 0. As usual we now write\nZ\nZ\n0\n0\n0\nj(w) = dw \u03b4(w \u2212 w )j(w ) , A = dw0 G(w, w0 )j(w0 ) ;\n(79)\nwhere G is the Green's function.\nClearly L\u0303 satisfies Green's theorem, so\nZ 1 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndw \u03c6L\u0303\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7L\u0303\u03c6 = 4 \u03c6\u2202w \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u2202w \u03c6)|w=1 ;\n\n(80)\n\n0\n\nwhere we have already eliminated the vanishing contribution from w = 0. We can use\n(80) with G and A, recalling that the non-normalizable mode satisfies Neumann boundary\nconditions at w = 1 - and taking j \u2192 0 we can write the non-normalizable mode as\nA(w, q 2 ) = N lim\n\u2202w0 G(w, w0 ) ;\n0\nw \u21921\n\n(81)\n\nwhere N is a constant. Thus we see that the non-normalizable mode is determined in\nterms of the Green's function of L\u0303. In order to find an expression for G we might consider\nthe equation\nII\nL\u03a6II\nn,0 + \u03bbn \u03c1\u03a6n,0 = 0 ;\n\n(82)\n\nwhere \u03bbn = \u03bbq |q2 =m2n,0 . This is nothing but the equation satisfied by the normalizable\nmodes \u03a6II\nn,0 . We keep the subscript 0 to remind the reader that these normalizable modes\ncorrespond to vector fields with l = 0. They satisfy the following completeness and orthonormality conditions\n\nX\n\nII\n\u03c1(w)\u03a6II\nn,0 (w)\u03a6m,0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n= \u03b4(w \u2212 w ) ,\n\n1\nII\ndw \u03c1(w)\u03a6II\nn,0 (w)\u03a6m,0 (w) = \u03b4nm .\n\n(83)\n\n0\n\nn\n\nThen if we consider\nG=\u2212\n\nII\n0\nX \u03a6II\nn,0 (w)\u03a6n,0 (w )\nn\n\n\u03bbn + \u03bbq\n28\n\n,\n\n(84)\n\n\fit is straightforward to check that this solves the Green's function equation for L\u0303. Therefore\nthe non-normalizable mode is given by\nA(w, q 2 ) =\n\nm2q X fn,0 \u03a6II\nn,0 (w)\n.\n2\n\u03bb n q + m2n,0\n\n(85)\n\nand the decay constant of the (n, 0) vector meson is given by\n0\nfn,0 = N lim\n\u2202w0 \u03a6II\nn,0 (w ) .\n0\nw \u21921\n\nB\n\n(86)\n\nOn the Callan-Gross relation\n\nWe now turn to the appearance of the Callan-Gross relation result in a deeper way. In the\ncontext of VMD it was argued that this type of relation should naturally appear [56]. Also\ndue to the structure of effective lagrangians we are considering, this could be thought of as\nthe low energy coupling of the Higgs to photons (see [57, 58]). From that perspective one\ncould argue that the effective vertex hF 2 involves, in particular, h going into \u03b3\u03b3 through\na top quark loop. Since the top quark is a spin 1/2 particle for which one expects CallanGross, it seems reasonable to expect that this effective vertex also re-sums Callan-Gross.\n\nB.1\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd contribution\n\nConsider\nX\n\n|(q\u03bc \u03be\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bd \u03be\u03bc )(p\u03bc \u000f\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bd \u000f\u03bc )|2 ,\n\n(87)\n\n\u000f\n\nwhere \u03be is the polarization vector of an external photon of momentum q and \u000f the polarization of a massive vector particle of momentum p and mass M .
