A macroscopic model of cuprate superconductors based\non the analogy with atomic nuclei has been proposed in Ref. [4], and by developing the OAI\nmethod [10], Iachello pointed out that the basic ingredients of the cuprate superconductor\nmodel are s- and d-wave pairs in a 2-dimensional Fermi system with a surface, which possesses\nthe properties advocated by M \u00fcller [3] on the basis of the analysis of recent experiments. The\nanalytic solutions of this model based on u(1)\n\nN\n\nu(2) and so(3) subalgebras structures of the\n\nsu(3) algebra have been discussed, which respectively correspond to the case of ignoring the\ninteraction strength v2 between s- and d-wave pairs and choosing v2 as some special value, but\nthe general solutions going beyond the actual subalgebra-confined framework have not been\ninvestigated. What about the eigenenergy of the Hamiltonian including the coherence between\ns- and d-wave pairs and the influence of the coherent term on the energy spectra in this system?\nThis is our task in this paper.\nFirstly, we study the cuprate superconductors model where there appears to be a competition between s- and d-wave pairing, and write its Hamiltonian as the bilinear function of\nthe generators of su(3) algebra. Then we use the mean-field approximate (MFA) method [11]\nso that the reduced Hamiltonian of this model can be presented as the linear function of the\ngenerators of su(3) algebra. Adopting the algebraic method [12], we get the eigenenergies of\nthe reduced Hamiltonian by introducing an operator of similar transformation. We also discuss\nthe case of considering the coherence between s- and d-wave pairs as perturbation, and analyze\nthe effects of coherent term upon energy spectrum subsequently.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND THE REDUCED HAMILTONIAN\n\nBy mapping from the fermion Hamiltonian, the boson Hamiltonian of cuprate superconductors based on the analogy with atomic nuclei was given by Iachello [4]:\n+\n+ +\nH = \u03b5s (s+ s) + \u03b5d (d+\n+ d+ + d\u2212 d\u2212 ) + u0 (s s ss)\n\n2\n\n\f+\n+ +\n\u2032\n+ +\n+u2(d+\n+ d+ d+ d+ + d\u2212 d\u2212 d\u2212 d\u2212 ) + u2 (d+ d\u2212 d+ d\u2212 )\n+\n+\n+ +\n+ +\n+v0 (d+\n+ d+ + d\u2212 d\u2212 )(s s) + v2 (d+ d\u2212 ss + s s d+ d\u2212 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5s and \u03b5d denote the single-boson energies; u0 , u2, u\u20322 , v0 and v2 are the strengths of the\nboson-boson interaction.

Following the standard Lie algebraic theory [18][19][20], if H0 is a linear function of the generators of a compact semisimple Lie group,\n\n4\n\n\fit can be transformed into a linear combination of the Cartan operators of the corresponding\nLie algebra by\nH1 = W H0 W \u2212 .\nHere W =\n\nQN\n\ni=1\n\n(12)\n\nexp(xi Ai ) is an element of the group and W \u2212 denotes the inverse of W , in\n\nwhich Ai (i = 1, ..., N) is a basis set in Cartan standard form of the semisimple Lie algebra,\nand xi can be set to zero if the corresponding Ai is a Cartan operator.\nIn order to give the complete eigenvalues, according to references [12][13], we choose the\nsimilar transition operator as\nW = exp(x21 I\u2212 )exp(x23 U+ )exp(x31 V+ )exp(x32 U\u2212 )exp(x13 V\u2212 )exp(x12 I+ ),\n\n(13)\n\nand let the coefficients of the non-Cartan operator vanish while substituting Eqs.(10)(13) into\nthe right-hand side of Eq.(12), then we get a set of algebraic equations of xij after lengthy\ncomputation:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u2212gx12 + (d \u2212 ex12 )x13 = 0\nf + cx12 \u2212 (h + 21 g)x13 \u2212 ex213 = 0\n\n(14)\n\nd \u2212 ex12 + (h \u2212 12 g + ex13 \u2212 cx32 )x32 = 0,\n\nand Hamiltonian after the transformation of W becomes diagonal:\n3\n3\nH1 = W H0W \u2212 = (g + ex13 + cx32 )I3 + (h + ex13 \u2212 cx32 )I8 .\n2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nOne can see that although operator W is not unitary, the similar transformation (12) guarantees that the eigenvalues of H0 equal those of H1 . This is acceptable for we are only concerned\nwith the eigenvalues. Supposing the common eigenstates of the Cartan generators I3 and I8 of\nLie algebra su(3) are the Fock states | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns >, i.e., for the commutative set {I3 , I8 , N}\nthere exist:\n1\nI3 | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns >= (nd\u2212 \u2212 nd+ ) | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns >,\n2\n1\nI8 | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns >= (nd+ + nd\u2212 \u2212 2ns ) | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns >,\n3\nN | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns >= (nd+ + nd\u2212 + ns ) | nd+ , nd\u2212 , ns > .\n\n(16)\n\nFrom Eqs.(15)(16) it follows the eigenvalue of the MFA Hamiltonian (9):\n1\n3\n3\n1\nEmf = (g + ex13 + cx32 )(nd\u2212 \u2212 nd+ ) + (h + ex13 \u2212 cx32 )(nd+ + nd\u2212 \u2212 2ns ) + E \u2032 . (17)\n2\n3\n2\n2\nIn the following, we will analyze the solutions of Eq.(17) in detail by comparing with Ref. [4].\n5\n\n\fA.\n\nA special case: v2 = 0\n\nConsidering the case of v2 = 0, we can easily find that the Hamiltonian (6) only consists\nof the su(3) Cartan operators {I3 , I8 } and the total particle number N. It is obvious that the\nEq.(14) only has the zero solution for xij and the eigenvalue reads for v2 = 0:\n1\n1\nE (A) (ns , nd , l) = \u03b5s ns + \u03b5d nd + u0 ns (ns \u2212 1) + u2 nd (nd \u2212 2) + u\u20322 n2d\n2\n4\n\u2032 2\n+(2u2 \u2212 u2 )l + v0 nd ns ,\nwhich is the same as \"phase (I)\" corresponding to u(1)\n\nN\n\n(18)\n\nu(2) algebraic structure in Ref.[4].\n\nWhen the system only has s-wave, the eigenvalue is E (Aa) (ns ) = \u03b5s ns + u0 ns (ns \u2212 1), while for\np-wave only, the eigenvalue becomes E (Ab) (nd , l) = \u03b5d nd + 21 u2 nd (nd \u2212 2) + 14 u\u20322 n2d + (2u2 \u2212 u\u20322 )l2 .\n(Note that here l = \u2212I3 = 21 (nd+ \u2212 nd\u2212 ), which is half of the l defined by Iachello [4].) It\ncan be naturally understood that Lie algebra su(3) could reduce to its subalgebra when some\nparameters are specified.\n\nB.\n\nThe case of v2 6= 0\n\nTo discuss the contribution of coherent term in Hamiltonian (1), i.e., the nonlinear term in\n(6), we will investigate the eigenvalues of the MFA Hamiltonian (9) by considering the coherent\nstrength v2 between s- and d-wave pairs as a perturbation.

On the contrary,\nh < 0, or \u03b1 < 0, is u2 < u0 and \u03b5d < \u03b5s , the energy of d-wave is lower than that of\ns-wave, and the self-interaction strength of s-wave is larger than that of d-wave. \u03b2\ndenotes the part of the contribution of coherence between s-wave and d-wave and is\npositive.\nFrom Eqs.(25)(26), one can draw the conclusion that when v2 = 0, the eigenenergy\nE1a reduces to E (I) , the eigenenergy of s-wave and d-wave mixed without the coherent interaction. Note that when nd+ = nd\u2212 and Eq.(19) holds, the eigenenergy E (A)\n(18) reduces to E (I) (27). Comparing with Ref.[4], E1b gives another eigenvalue of\nthe system, and when v2 = 0 E1b reduces to E (II) , which is another eigenenergy of\ns-wave and d-wave mixed without the coherent interaction. Based on Eqs.(27)(29),\nwe find that E (I) > E (II) when \u03b1 > 0 and 2ns < nd or \u03b1 < 0 and 2ns > nd ;\nE (I) < E (II) holds for \u03b1 > 0 and 2ns > nd or \u03b1 < 0 and 2ns < nd , i.e., there exists\nthe case that E (I) or E (II) is the ground state for different cases. The last two terms\nin Eq.(25) and Eq.(26) are the contributions of the coherent term indicated by v2 in\nHamiltonian (9) corresponding to eigenenergies E1a and E1b respectively, the first\nterm including v2 causes split between nd and ns energy levels, and the last term\nleads to the energy have a total shift, whose direction is determined by the sign of\nv2 . Split between nd and ns and the total shift make the energy spectrum different\n8\n\n\ffrom the case of v2 = 0, especially the change of the energy gap between s-wave and\nd-wave.\nFor h > 0 and v2 > 0, the energy eigenvalue E1a has the smaller value when the\nparticle number ns is more than the particle number nd , and the coherent strength\nbetween s-wave and d-wave is large as possible.

In order to investigate the solutions of this quantum system, we\nhave used the mean-field approximation and got the reduced Hamiltonian in a form with linear\nfunction of the su(3) algebra generators. By introducing the similar transformation operator W\nand eliminating the non-Cartan generators after the similar transformation through parameter\nxij , we have obtained the eigenenergies of the reduced Hamiltonian beyond the subalgebraconfined framework. It should be noted that the order of the operators in W can be chosen\narbitrarily, but the coefficients xij are strongly dependent on the order, that is, the operator\nW in this algebraic method is not exclusive. Although any specified order has a solution, a\nproperly chosen order can simplify the procedure to get the xij . The advantage of this algebraic\nmethod is that the transformation operator W ensures the eigenvalue of Hamiltonian H1 as\nthe same as that of Hamiltonian H. In particular, we have analyzed the effects of the coherent\nterm, when we consider it as a perturbative one. We get another new eigenvalue E (II) for\nthe case of s-wave and d-wave mixed without the coherent interaction. Furthermore, the split\nand the whole shift of the energy spectra induced by the coherent term could be understood\nclearly. Much work (such as the numerical calculations) remains to be done in the field of\nsearching and seeking more general solutions going beyond the present works, which can help\nus to understand more and deeper about the model of cuprate superconductors based on the\nanalogy with atomic nuclei.\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is in part supported by NSF of China under Grant No. 10447103, No. 10405006,\nand the Foundation of Beihang University.\n\n[1] Arima A and Iachello F 1975 Phys.
