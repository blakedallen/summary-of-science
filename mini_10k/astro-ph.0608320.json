The GPS and CSS\nsources have generally simple and convex radio spectra with peaks near 1 GHz and 100 MHz,\nrespectively.\nModels for the evolution of powerful radio galaxies (Fanti et al. 1995; Begelman 1996;\nReadhead et al. 1996b; O'Dea & Baum 1997; De Young 1997; Kaiser & Alexander 1997;\n1\n\nDept of Physics, RIT\n\n2\n\nCenter for Imaging Science, RIT\n\n3\n\nUniversity of Bristol\n\n4\n\nIGPP/LLNL\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nKaiser, Dennett-Thorpe, & Alexander 1997; O'Dea & Baum 1997; Blundell, Rawlings &\nWillott 1999; and cf Snellen et al. 2000) are generally consistent with a scenario in which\nthese sources propagate from the \u223c 10 pc to Mpc scales at roughly constant velocity through\nan ambient medium which declines in density while the sources decline in radio luminosity.\nThere is increasing evidence that the GPS and CSS sources interact with the host galaxy\nas they propagate through it. Broad- and narrow-band HST imaging of CSS radio sources\n(De Vries et al. 1997, 1999; Axon et al. 2000) have shown that CSS radio galaxies at all\nredshifts exhibit emission-line gas which is strongly aligned with the radio source. The\nalignment is much stronger than seen in low redshift large-scale radio galaxies and is similar\nto that seen in high redshift (z >\n\u223c 0.6) radio galaxies. The close association between the gas\nand the radio source suggests that the latter interacts strongly with the ambient medium as\nit propagates through the ISM.\nIn 3C 303.1 cooling time arguments (e.g., Pedlar, Dyson, & Unger 1985; Taylor, Dyson,\n& Axon 1992) applied to the gap between the radio hot spots and the onset of bright emission\u22121\nline gas are consistent with lobe expansion velocities >\n\u223c 6000 km s for ambient densities\nof n \u223c 1 cm\u22123 (De Vries et al. 1999). The broad and highly structured spatially integrated\n[OIII]\u03bb5007 line widths observed by Gelderman & Whittle (1994) strongly suggest that\nthe radio source is dominating the emission-line kinematics. HST/STIS long-slit mediumdispersion spectroscopy of the aligned emission-line gas has shown that the kinematics of\nthe gas are consistent with cloud motions driven by interaction with the expanding radio\nsource (O'Dea et al. 2002). Constraints on the bow shock velocity from lifetime and cooling\narguments are in the range few \u00d7103 km s\u22121 to few \u00d7104 km s\u22121 (O'Dea et al. 2002). Analysis\nof the low dispersion STIS spectra reveals that the ionization diagnostics are consistent with\nstrong contributions from shocked gas (Labiano et al. 2005). HST UV imaging shows a clear\ndetection of UV continuum light tightly aligned with the radio source (Labiano et al. 2006).\nThese observations are all consistent with the radio source in 3C 303.1 interacting with gas\nclouds in its environment, shocking them and triggering star formation.\nThe interaction of the radio source with its environment may also produce observable\nsignatures in the X-ray. Heinz, Reynolds & Begelman (1998) suggested that compact evolving radio galaxies might create shells of hot shocked gas as they expand into the ambient\nmedium. X-ray observations have found examples of both hotter (e.g., Kraft et al. 2003;\nWilson, Smith & Young 2006) and cooler (e.g., Nulsen et al. 2005; Soker, Blanton & Sarazin\n2002; Blanton et al. 2001) shells of ambient gas swept up by expanding radio galaxies.\nIn this paper we present XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the CSS radio galaxy\n3C 303.1. We discuss the results and their implications for our understanding of CSS radio\nsources.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nTHE XMM OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS\n\nThe properties of the source are given in Table 1. We observed 3C 303.1 with XMMNewton for about 40 ks on August, 18, 2003. Three EPIC cameras, MOS-1, MOS-2 and pn,\nwere operated with medium optical blocking filters in \"Prime Full Window\" mode, which\ncovers the full field-of-view (FOV) of 30' diameter. Because a fraction of the flux collected by\nthe telescopes hosting the MOS cameras is directed to dispersing grating arrays, the photons\ncollected by each MOS camera are fewer than those collected by the pn camera.\nThe data were reprocessed using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS)\nv6.1.0. EMCHAIN and EPCHAIN were employed to obtain the photon event lists. Then we\nused EVSELECT to select single, double, triple and quadruple (PATTERN <\n\u223c 12) for MOS,\nand single and double events (PATTERN <\n\u223c 4) for pn with the energy range from 0.2 keV\nto 12 keV. FLAG was set to zero to reject the events which are close to the CCD gap and\nbad pixels. Because of the high EPIC background due to contamination by solar protons we\nrestricted the data using Good Time Interval (GTI) filters. Details of the resultant exposure\ntimes and count rates in the three cameras are given in Table 2. The pn image, showing\nthe detection of a faint source at the location of 3C 303.1 is given in the left-hand panel of\nFigure 1.\n\n2.1.\n\nSource Size\n\nThe radial profiles of the source counts are consistent with the X-ray source being\nunresolved by the pn and MOS detectors. This is consistent with the emission being produced\nby the radio source (1.7 arcsec) and/or the host galaxy (20 kpc = 4.9 arcsec). Galaxy counts\nby Harvanek et al. (2001) show no evidence for a cluster of galaxies surrounding 3C 303.1.\n\n2.2.\n\nSpectral Fitting\n\nWe chose an on-source extraction circle of 40 arc-second radius, which at 1.5 keV corresponds to \u223c 87% encircled energy for the MOS and \u223c 83% encircled energy for the pn. The\nMOS local background region was an annulus surrounding 3C 303.1 with inner and outer\nradii of 40 and 80 arcsec, respectively, with two unrelated sources masked. For the pn the\nbackground region was a circle the same size as the on-source region but from a source-free\nregion of the same RAWY. For each camera the task ESPECGET was employed to generate\na background-subtracted spectrum, grouped with 25 counts minimum per spectral bin to\nimprove the statistics, a Redistribution Matrix File (RMF), and an Auxiliary Response File\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(ARF). Data above 8 keV and below 0.4 keV were excluded from the spectral model fitting\ndue to the poor statistics at these energies. The resulting count rates are given in Table 2.\nWe fitted the pn and MOS spectra simultaneously with several models consisting of different combinations of absorption with power law (PL) and Raymond-Smith (RS) thermal\nmodels using XSPEC 12.2.0cf. The results are given in Tables 3\u20135. We obtain an acceptable fit for a RS model with Galactic absorption (frozen), solar abundance (frozen), and a\ntemperature of kT\u223c 0.8 keV (Table 3). We do not obtain an acceptable fit with a single PL\nmodel with either Galactic absorption alone or excess intrinsic absorption. Our single RS\nfit improves if we add a PL component (Table 4), though the photon index is very poorly\nconstrained by our data. Assuming a plausible photon index, e.g., \u0393 = 1.5, there is no need\nfor absorption in excess of Galactic towards the PL component. In order to constrain a\npossible hot component due to gas shocked by the radio source (\u00a73.2) we considered a two\ntemperature model with T1 = 0.8 and T2 = 45 keV (Table 5). Such a model is also an\nimprovement over a single temperature thermal model. Figure 2 shows the spectral data\ntogether with the model components of Table 4 folded through the detector response files.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Thermal Component\n\nThe luminosity (Lx \u223c 2 \u00d7 1042 ergs s\u22121 ) and temperature (kT\u223c 0.8 keV) of the RS\ncomponent are consistent with the values found in elliptical galaxies hosting radio sources\n(e.g., Worrall & Birkinshaw 2000) and possibly small groups (e.g., Helsdon & Ponman 2000).\nHowever, the X-ray emission is both too faint and too cool to be consistent with a cluster\nof galaxies (e.g., Arnaud & Evrard 1999). This suggests that we have detected the ISM of\nthe host galaxy or possibly the intragroup medium (if there is a galaxy group).\n\n3.2.\n\nConstraints on shock heated gas\n\nThe expanding radio source will run over and shock the ambient gas possibly producing\ndetectable emission (e.g., Heinz et al. 1998). We calculate the expected properties of the\nshocked gas following Worrall et al. (2005). The sound speed in the 0.8 keV ISM is cs \u2243\n460 km s\u22121 . If the propagation velocity of the radio source is as high as 6000 km s\u22121 as\nsuggested by the cooling-time arguments for the emission line nebula (De Vries et al. 1999),\nthe Mach number is M \u2243 13. For such a strong shock the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions\ngive a temperature ratio between shocked and pre-shocked gas of T2 /T1 \u2243 54, which implies\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nT2 \u2243 43 keV. We note that a two-temperature model with T1 = 0.8 and T2 = 45 keV is\npermitted by the data (Table 5).\nTaking into account the uncertainties, Table 5 shows that the normalizations of the\nheated (shocked) to cool (unshocked) gas is a factor of roughly 0.9 to 6. The 1-keV\nnormalization is proportional to n2 V , where n is the number density of electrons or protons and V is the volume. Since the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for a strong shock give\nnshocked /nunshocked = 4, the X-ray spectral results are consistent with Vunshocked /Vshocked \u223c 3 to\n18. What is the volume of the shocked gas? We detect radio emission from the cocoon but\nnot from the hot shocked gas which lies between the cocoon and the bow shock. We use the\nnumerical simulations of Carvalho & O'Dea (2002) as a guide to estimate the ratio of the volumes of hot shocked gas and cocoon. The estimated ratio is model dependent and varies with\nthe jet density contrast and Mach number. For a light, supersonic jet the numerical simulations suggest a value of about 3 for the ratio of hot shocked gas to cocoon volume. Adopting\na value of 3 along with the estimates of cocoon volume from the MERLIN observations gives\na volume of shocked gas of about 14 kpc3 . We find the volume of unshocked gas is large\nenough to be consistent with a realistic galaxy atmosphere if Vunshocked /Vshocked is towards\nthe upper value permitted by the X-ray spectral fitting. For example, if Vunshocked /Vshocked\nis 18, a spherical galaxy of uniform density would be required to have a radius of about 4\nkpc. Such a galaxy has a similar n2 V to one of the same central density modeled with a \u03b2\nmodel of \u03b2 = 2/3 and core radius of \u223c 3 kpc. Chandra measurements of the atmospheres\naround relatively powerful nearby radio galaxies are fitted to \u03b2 models that typically bracket\nthese parameter values (e.g., Kraft et al. 2005, Worrall & Birkinshaw 2005). High-resolution\nX-ray imaging spectroscopy would probe the density and temperature structure and should\nconfirm whether such a high-temperature component exists.\n\n3.3.\n\nThe Power-Law Component\n\nHere we consider the possibility that there is a significant non-thermal power-law component, i.e., the second component in the fit to the spectrum is not due to a hot shocked\ngas. The lack of a high intrinsic absorbing column towards the PL component suggests\nthat it is not from accretion-disk emission that would be expected to be obscured in this\npowerful two-sided radio galaxy, and the fact that the nucleus is undetected both at 1.6\nGHz (Sanghera et al. 1995) and at 5.0 GHz (L\u00fcdke et al. 1998) disfavors the X-ray emission\noriginating from a small-scale jet. X-ray binaries produce emission that can mimic a hard\npower law, but the luminosity of > 1042 ergs s\u22121 is one or two orders of magnitude more\nthan is typically measured in elliptical galaxies (e.g., Kim & Fabbiano 2004).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThe most likely explanation for a power-law component would appear to be inverse\nCompton emission from the lobes of the radio galaxy. We estimate the expected flux (e.g.,\nHarris & Grindlay 1979; Harris & Krawczynski 2002; Hardcastle, Birkinshaw & Worrall\n1998) using the MERLIN radio measurements of Sanghera et al. (1995), where at 1.6 GHz\nthe Southern lobe contains about 90% of the total radio flux density. We find that, because\nof the small size of the lobes, Synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) dominates the X-ray yield\nfrom scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation.\nResults of the SSC calculations are presented in Table 6. In these calculations we adopt\na single-component power-law electron spectrum of slope consistent with the observed radio\nsynchrotron spectrum (Sanghera et al.). In order to maximize the SSC output under the\nequipartition assumptions, we set the minimum electron energy to no lower than is required to\nproduce the radio emission, and we assume no non-radiating particles (protons) are present.\nIf the magnetic field is at the equipartition strength, the predicted SSC X-ray flux is too\nlow by factors of \u223c 350 in the Northern lobe and \u223c 16 in the Southern lobe. However,\nif the field is below the equipartition level by factors of \u223c 16 and \u223c 3.5, in the N and S\nlobes, respectively, the predicted flux is comparable to that in the measured PL component.\nThere is some evidence that the magnetic fields in some radio lobes are indeed about 1/3 of\nthe equipartition strength (e.g., Carilli, Perley & Harris 1994; Wellman, Daly & Wan 1997;\nCroston et al. 2005), and thus there is additional justification for the PL component arising\nfrom SSC emission primarily in the S lobe of 3C 303.1, with a magnetic field about 1/3 of\nthe equipartition value. If this is the correct interpretation it suggests that the mechanism\nfor keeping the average B field below equipartition occurs in young radio galaxies and is not\njust a feature of large FRIIs.\n\n3.4.\n\nComparison with other Radio Galaxies\n\nThere are now X-ray observations of a dozen GPS radio galaxies (O'Dea et al. 1996, 2000;\nIwasawa et al. 1999; Guainazzi et al. 2004, 2006; Vink et al. 2006). 4C+55.16 appears to be\nin a cluster with a cooling flow (Iwasawa et al. 1999). The others are dominated by a powerlaw component with intrinsic absorption of N(H) \u223c 1022 to \u223c 1024 cm\u22122 (Guainazzi et al.\n2006; Vink et al. 2006). This intrinsic absorption is larger than the HI absorption along the\nline of sight to the radio emission in the small number of cases where the radio measurements\nhave been made (Vink et al.), thus suggesting that the absorbed X-ray emission arises from\nthe vicinity of an accretion disk.\nLarge narrow-emission-line FRII radio galaxies generally have two nuclear X-ray components (Belsole et al. 2006). One has intrinsic absorption similar to that measured for\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nmost GPS sources, and is interpreted as accretion related, and the other is unabsorbed and\nidentified as arising from jet emission within the radio core. Our X-ray measurements of the\nCSS radio galaxy 3C 303.1 find no evidence for absorbed emission \u2013 it is either absent or\nvery weak. If absent, it may suggest that the central engine of 3C 303.1 is more similar to\nthat of an FRI radio galaxy, where absorbed X-ray components are rarely seen (Evans et al.\n2006 \u2013 but note the cases of Cen A [Evans et al. 2004] and NGC 4261 [Zezas et al. 2005]).\nThe radio core of 3C 303.1 is undetected, and if the second X-ray spectral component is\nindeed non-thermal, then it is much more plausibly associated with the radio lobes than\nwith the radio core. The alternative hypothesis is that we are seeing shocked gas. In either\ncase this hard emission should be spatially resolved in Chandra observations. It appears\nthat the weak core of 3C 303.1 is an advantage in allowing other X-ray components to be\nseen more clearly.\n\n4.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nUsing XMM we detect faint unresolved X-ray emission from the CSS radio galaxy\n3C 303.1. We detect a thermal component at kT \u2243 0.8 keV which seems likely to be\nproduced in the ISM of the host galaxy. There is evidence for a second component in the\nspectrum whose nature is currently ambiguous. It does not appear to be related to the core,\ngiving 3C 303.1 the advantage over other GPS/CSS radio galaxies that extended components\nshow up more clearly. Plausible hypotheses include (1) hot gas shocked by the expansion of\nthe radio source, and (2) SSC emission from the southern radio lobe if the magnetic field\nis below the equipartition value by a factor of about 3.5. In the former case this would be\nthe first detection of strongly shocked gas around an FRII radio source. In the latter case\nit would be a rare instance of the detection of SSC emission from a radio lobe, as distinct\nfrom a small localized hot spot. Deep Chandra observations could confirm the presence of\nthis extended component and improve our understanding of its origin.\nWe would like to thank the referee for helpful comments and Joel Carvalho for helping to\ninterpret the numerical simulations.
