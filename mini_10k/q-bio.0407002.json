The pioneering field in this direction was physics,\nwhere nonlinear phenomena have been the subject of intense study since the seminal work of Fermi, Pasta and\nUlam almost fifty years ago [2]. The success of this approach in modelling of complex systems led scientists in\nother fields to apply it to their own research. That is the\ncase in biology, where nonlinear models were successfully\nintroduced more than 20 years ago [3] (see also [4] for\nreferences). One of the subjects where nonlinear models have been more productive is the modelling of DNA\nphysics [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which began in 1980 with the model\nproposed by Englander and coworkers [10]. Since then,\na lot of work has been devoted to nonlinear excitations\nin DNA, both from the dynamics and the statistical mechanics viewpoints. We refer the reader to [7, 9] for historical accounts and extensive summaries of the available\nresults, among which we want to highlight the PeyrardBishop model [11] (see also the generalizations and improvements proposed in [12, 13]). In spite of its simplicity, this nonlinear lattice system can accurately (some-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: scuenda@math.uc3m.es\nhttp://gisc.uc3m.es\n\u2021 Electronic address: anxo@math.uc3m.es\n\u2020 URL:\n\ntimes even quantitatively) reproduce the phenomenology\nexperimentally observed in DNA (see, e.g., [14]).\nMost of the research done in the framework of the\nabove mentioned models refers to homopolymers, i.e.,\nhomogeneous DNA molecules consisting entirely of A-T\nor C-G base pairs. One problem of special interest was\nthe thermal denaturation transition, that takes place at\ntemperatures around 90\u25e6 C when the two strands of the\nDNA molecule separate. Having understood this transition quite well [9, 15], the main focus of research has\nturned dynamical and transport features. Additional motivation for such a shift arises from the capability to carry\nout experiments on single molecules, achieved in the last\nfew years [16]. Another particularly important, related\nquestion is genomics, or gene identification, which is profiting enormously from the information obtained from\ndynamical models [17]. Of course, these applications\nrequire unavoidably the study of DNA heteropolymers,\nwhere the distribution of A-T and C-G base pairs follows\nnon-uniform, non-homogeneous sequences obtained from\ngenome analysis. In this context, physical models are also\nbeing used to idenfity dynamically relevant sites, such as\npromoters [18] in short genomes (e.g., viral). Further\nadvance along this line requires good models for DNA\ndynamics that can be computationally efficient, in order\nto treat much longer sequences. Such models will also\nbe of use to achieve a better understanding the relationship between sequence, physical properties, and biological function.\nIn this work, we address these issues in the framework\n\n\f2\n\nun\n\nas well. Introducing damping and an external force these\npendula are described by the discrete, dc driven, damped\nsine-Gordon model, given by\n\u00fcn \u2212\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch of the Englander model. The two sugarphosphate backbones of the DNA strands are depicted as\ntwo straight lines connected by the base pairs (bases are the\nsquares). The lower strand is assumed to be fixed and as\nshown on the right, the angle un is the deviation of the upper\nbase of the n-th pair with respect to the plane defined by the\nfixed base pairs in the lower strand.\n\nof a very simple model, namely the Englander model [10],\nwhich we generalize by incorporating actual genetic sequences. Our aim is to assess whether the so modified\nmodel, in spite of its simplicity, reproduces the important\nfeatures of DNA molecule dynamics accurately enough to\nbe useful for genomic and related applications. We will\nalso discuss an approximation in terms of an effective\npotential and its application to understanding the dynamics of nonlinear excitations in DNA. In addition, we\nwill test a conjecture, put forward by Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame\nand coworkers [19], that the dynamics of nonlinear excitations along DNA molecules should, at the level of the\nEnglander model, depend on the information content of\nthe chain. To this end, the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the Englander model and\nthe previous attempts to include inhomogeneity or genetic information in it. the genetic sequence in it. In\nso doing, we will discuss in some detail the results of\nDom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame et al., extending their work to consider the effects of changing the initial location of the\npropagating kinks. Subsequently, in Sec. III, we present\nour results on the Englander model with human genome\nsequences. We analyze the results by comparing them to\nthe phenomenology observed on aperiodic sequences and\nto the experimentally observed DNA dynamics. Finally,\nSection IV concludes the paper by summarizing our main\nresults and their possible implications.\n\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1\n(un+1 \u2212 2un + un\u22121 )+ qn sin un = \u2212\u03b1u\u0307n \u2212 F, (1)\na2\n\nwhere a is the lattice spacing, qn is a site dependent constant which arises from the specific parameters for the\npendulum at site n, \u03b1 is the damping coefficient, and\nF is a driving term possibly acting on the chain. We\nnote at this point that Eq. (1) reflects mainly the difference in interactions between A-T and C-G base pairs,\nbut not other differences such as in mass or moments of\ninertia. It should also be clear that many other relevant\nfactors (geometry, inhomogeneous stacking interactions\n[20]) have also been neglected, in the spirit of designing\na model as simple as possible that still behaves like DNA\nmolecules.\nWhen qn = q (i.e., we have a homopolymer) in Eq. (1)\nand the lattice spacing is very small, the system of ordinary differential equations (1) can be very well approximated by its continuum limit. Letting un (t)\u2212\u2192u(x, t)\nwhen a2 \u226a q, we find the driven, damped sine-Gordon\nequation:\n\u2202t2 u \u2212 \u2202x2 u + q sin u = \u2212\u03b1\u2202t u \u2212 F.\n\nIt is well known [1] that, in the absence of force, i.e.,\nF = 0, Eq. (2) possesses soliton solutions of the kink\ntype, whose expression is\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u001b\n\u221a x \u2212 x0 \u2212 vt\n\u221a\n\u03c6\u00b1 (x, t) = 4 arctan exp \u00b1 q\n(3)\n1 \u2212 v2\nwhere the plus or minus sign stands for kinks or antikinks\nrespectively, and 0 \u2264 v \u2264 1 represents their velocity. In\nthe case F = 0 and in the presence of damping, \u03b1 6= 0,\nthe only possible value for the velocity is v = 0. When\nboth damping and force are present, the balance between\nthe two effects leads to kinks propagating at a constant,\nnonzero velocity. An analytical expression for that velocity can be easily derived [again, for homogenous sequences, i.e., from Eq. (2)] from energy conservation arguments (see [21]):\n\"\n\nv = 1+q\nA.\n\nModel definition: the homogeneous case\n\nThe model proposed by Englander et al. [10] is\nsketched in Fig. 1, where the dynamics of one of the\nstrands of the DNA is represented as a chain of pendula;\nleaving the other strand fixed (the one at the bottom in\nthe picture), the base pairs of the (upper) strand behave\nlike pendula in an effective \"gravitational field\" caused\nby the tendency of the base pairs of the two strands to\nbe facing each other. It must be realized that this model\ndescribes only the dynamics of the base pairs around the\nsugar-phosphate backbone, which is assumed to be fixed\n\n(2)\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03b1\n\u03c0F\n\n\u00132 #\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nFigure 2 depictes the physical meaning of a kink solution\nin the context of DNA modelling: the bases of the upper\nchain perform a complete, smooth turn around the sugarphosphate backbone, from un = 0 to un = 2\u03c0.\nOne feature of the model that deserves some comment\nis its mesoscopic character. Experiments and a great part\nof the theoretical work done so far on mechanical denaturation or unzipping ([16]; for the first unzipping experiments see [22]) deals with forces acting on the last base\nof one of the strands pulling them apart. In the perspective of Englander's model, we are not trying to describe\n\n\f3\ndynamics in terms of an effective potential. We will not\nreview in detail the procedure to obtain this effective\npotential but, instead, we will simply outline the main\nsteps. The idea is to consider the undamped model, i.e.,\nEq. (1) with \u03b1 = 0, on a finite lattice of N sites, described\nby the Hamiltonian\nH sG [{u}] =\n\nFIG. 2: Kink soliton in the sine-Gordon model. The kink\njoins a sector of the chain where bases are closed, un = 0,\nto another one where bases have performed a complete turn,\nun = 2\u03c0. In this last part the chain is said to be open if the\nmodel is to represent mechanical denaturation.\n\naccurately the way the chain is pulled but rather we are\nlooking at how this pulling affects the \"propagation\" of\nthe opening. Of course, both approaches are different\nand need not yield the same results, although one expects in principle that the qualitative behavior should be\nthe same. As we will see below, the advantage of our\napproach is that it allows some analytic insight on the\nproblem, much less amenable from the microscopic viewpoint.\nB.\n\nN\nX\n1\n1\n{ u\u03072n + 2 [un+1 \u2212 un ]2\n2\n2a\nn=1\n\n+ qn (1 \u2212 cos un ) + F un }.\n\nWe now take the following Ansatz\n\b\n\u0002\u221a\n\u0003\n\u03c6n (X(t)) = 4 arctan exp qavg (na \u2212 X(t)) ,\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere qavg is the average value of qn over the chain, and\nX(t) is a collective coordinate variable which stands for\nthe center of the kink. Substituting this expresion into\nthe Hamiltonian (5), we arrive at\nEef f =\n\n1 2\n\u1e8a + Vef f (n, {qn }),\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is formally equivalent to the energy of a particle\nsubjected to the action of the effective potential Vef f .\nThe exact formula for this potential is quite cumbersome\nand we do not need to reproduce it here. We refer the\nreader interested in the details of the calculation and the\nfull result to [19, 26, 28].\n\nInclusion of inhomogeneities\nC.\n\nThe results we have summarized in the previous subsection refer mostly to the homopolymer case, which was\nthe one initially considered by Englander et al. [10], As\nstated in the introduction, our main is to understand the\neffects of inhomogeneity, and particularly of genetic sequences obtained from real data. We stress that including inhomoengeity, i.e., qn depending on n in Eq. (1),\nrenders the theoretical approach in the preceding subsection unapplicable. To our knowledge, DNA sequences\nfrom living organisms were first studied in the framework\nof the Englander model by Salerno, who considered the\neffects of the sequence by studying spontaneously travelling kinks along the T7A1 promoter (a region of the\ngenome preceding a gene where the transcription activity starts) of the bacteriophage T7. Salerno studied further other regions of the bacteriophage [24], finding that\nthe dynamical activity of kinks should be very special in\nthe promoters. Recently, the problem was revisited in\n[25] following the sequencing of the whole genome of the\nbacteriophage T7. The main conclusion of this work was\nthat there indeed is a significantly higher degree of activity in promoter regions, even in the presence of noise.\nThe results of the simulations reported in [23, 24] were\nanalyzed theoretically by Salerno and Kivshar [26], who,\nusing a collective coordinate approach (see, e.g., [27] for\na review on collective coordinate techniques for solitonbearing equations), developed a description of the kink\n\nAperiodic chains\n\nSince the sequences considered by Salerno [23, 24] are\nvery small, the question arises immediately as to the real\nrelevance of those results. On the other hand, in 1995\nthere were not many genomic data available, making the\nquestion difficult to answer. To overcome this difficulty,\nDom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame and coworkers [19] proposed to mimic\nthe behavior of DNA heteropolymers of biological relevance by replacing the sequence dependent values qn by\nan aperiodic, but fully deterministic sequence. The rationale behind this choice is to consider the DNA sequence\nas non-periodic but non-random either, in so far as it\ncarries information. As an example, they considered the\nFibonacci and Thue-Morse sequences. Most of the results\nwere related to the former, that is generated according\nto the rules qa \u2192 qa qb , qb \u2192 qa repeteadly applied to the\ninitial seed qa .\nBeing the immediate predecessor of the present work,\nit is worth summarizing here the results in [19]. As a first\nstep, Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame et al. constructed a periodic sequence {qn } whose unit cell was a Fibonacci sequence of\norder k, Fk (F1 = qa , F2 = qa qb , F3 = qa qb qa , . . .). This\namounts to saying that the resulting chain is given by\n{qn } = Fk Fk Fk .... The number of unit cells was chosen such that the length of the whole sequence {qn } was\nabout 4000 sites. Subsequently, they placed a kink of\nthe form (6) at rest in the middle of the sequence and\n\n\f4\n\n0.8\n\nv\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nF\nFIG. 3: Steady state velocity versus applied force for a periodic Fibonacci chain.

Further, they suggested\nthat the fact that there are long range correlations in\nDNA and, in any event, that it contains information and\nis not purely random, could lead to similar phenomenology in the propagation of nonlinear coherent excitations\nalong the molecule. At this point is where we revisit this\nquestion, benefiting from the huge body of genome data\navailable nowadays. As we will show in the next section,\non the grounds of the revision presented here, the conjecture about the information in [19] is likely to be incorrect, at least if we consider that the information content\nof coding DNA is different from non-coding DNA. We\nwill come back to this issue in the conclusions, after discussing the results for real DNA sequences, in the next\nSection. Before proceeding to those results, we find it\ninteresting to extend the results in [19] by discussing the\nrelevance of the choice of the initial location for the kink.\nThis we do in the subsection immediately below.\n\nD.\n\npulled it with a constant force F in order to find the\nasymptotic velocity of the kink (recall that \u03b1 6= 0 in Eq.\n(1), implying the existence of damping). This computation was performed for various orders (i.e., sizes) of the\nFibonacci unit cells, Fk , up to a non-periodic, full Fibonacci sequence of 4181 sites (k = 18). The results of\nDom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame et al., subsequently confirmed in [28],\npointed out the existence of an intriguing phenomenon,\nnamely the existence of a threshold force for a kink to\nstart moving along the chain. Once the force is above\nthe threshold, the kink moves asymptotically with a periodic velocity, as a consequence of the periodicity of the\nconstructed sequence (except in the case of the aperiodic\nF18 sequence, in which the asymptotic, aperiodic velocity\nfluctuates around a mean value), given by the balance of\ndamping and driving. Although the original derivation\nof Eq. (4) is valid for a homogeneous chain, reproducing\nit with a value qavg , obtained by averaging qn over all\nlattice sites, leads to a prediction which is very accurate,\nabove the threshold, for all the periodic chains, including\nthe final, full Fibonacci chain F1 8. Such prediction overestimates slightly the velocity when increasing the ratio\nbetween the two parameters qa and qb (see Fig. 3 for details). In addition, in [19], it was also found that the\nthreshold value depended on the length of the periodic\nchain considered: Increasing the size of the unit cell Fk\nled to an increasing of the threshold, reaching a limiting\nvalue for the full Fibonacci sequence.\nBased on the above summarized results and on the\nfact that, for the same parameters, random chains ex-\n\nEffect of the inital position of the kink\n\nAs we have said above, Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame et al. considered only the existence of a threshold force for propagation on aperiodic chains. Although this phenomenon\nwas addressed and interpreted correctly in [19], we have\nfound that depending on the shape of the effective potential around the starting position of the kink, it is more or\nless difficult to make it move until the end of the lattice.\nIf the initial position of a kink is a peak of the effective\npotential, it will cost less force to overcome the next barrier than if the starting point is a well, as shown in Fig. 4.\nGiven the above considerations, one can expect that\nfor sequences formed with unit cells of different sizes,\nbut with identical effective potential in the vicinities of\nthe starting points, the threshold force will be the same\nin both cases. This can be seen in Fig. 5: In Figs. 5\n(a) and (b), we see that for small unit cells, the main\nstructure of peaks and wells of the Fibonacci sequence\nhas not been formed yet. This can be seen, for instance,\nin the effective potentials of sequences with unit cell given\nby F7 (of size 21) and larger, which have the same values\nin the surroundings of the beginning of each unit cell.\nIf we choose the initial position of a kink to be near the\nbeginning of a unit cell, the force needed to overcome the\nfirst barrier will be the same as in another sequence with\ndifferent unit cell, if the initial positions, related to the\nbeginning of each unit cell, are the same. For unit cells\nof smaller size the effective pottential is different and,\ntherefore, so is the threshold force [see Fig. 5 (c)].\n\n\f5\n(a)\n0.02\n\n0.8\n0.015\n\nVeff\n\n0.6\nwell\npeak\ntheoretical\n\nv\n\n0.4\n\n0.01\n\nF5\nF6\n\n0.005\n\n0\n-30\n\n0.2\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n20\n\n30\n\nn - n_k\n(b)\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.02\n\n0.25\n\nF\nF7\nF8\nF11\n\nFIG. 4: Numerical results of steady state velocity versus\napplied force for a periodic Fibonacci chain with unit cell F9 ,\nqa = 1 and qb = 10, but starting from a peak (\u25e6) and from a\nwell (\u00d7).

To this end, we have\nsimulated numerically Eq. (1) with {qn } sequences obtained from the human genome. We want to stress that\nthis description of DNA, arising from the original model\nof Englander and coworkers [10], intends to be only qualitatively correct. Therefore, the parameters can be freely\nchosen, trying, of course, to mimic the real ones. Accordingly, we choose qa = 2 and qb = 3 depending on whether\nwe have at site n an A-T pair, linked by two hydrogen\nbonds, or a C-G pair, with three hydrogen bonds. The\nother parameters are chosen as in [19], namely lattice\nspacing a = 0.1 and damping \u03b1 = 0.1. With respect to\nthe lattice spacing, we want to point out that the chosen\nvalue leads to a width of the kink which is comparable to\nthat of spontaneous openings of real DNA chains (some\n20 to 40 base pairs). The numerical simulations have\nbeen carried out with a standard 4th order Runge-Kutta\nscheme, with free or periodic boundary conditions. Finally, for the sequences we use data obtained from the\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information for the\nhuman genome [29].\nTypical results from our simulations are plotted in Fig.\n6, that presents a phase space plot for the center of the\nkink on an actual DNA sequence when the kink is forced\nwith two different drivings. For reference, we plot in the\nsame graph the effective potential, that can be computed\nfor any sequence as described in the previous section.

Comparison of propagation along a\ncoding region (up, same contig as in Fig. 6, positions 114 000\nto 115 000) and a non-coding region (down, same contig as in\nFig. 6, positions 50 000 to 51 000).\n\nis important to note that the effective potential does not\ncontain the contribution of the force F , and therefore its\nmost relevant information is the position of the peaks\nand valleys. With this in mind, we see that the dynamics occurs basically as in the case of the Fibonacci chain.\nThere is a threshold for the kink to propagate along the\nwhole chain, shown by the fact that the kink ends up\ntrapped at a potential well in the upper plot of Fig. 6,\nalthough the effective potential structure is very different\nfrom the Fibonacci case. When the applied force exceeds\nthe threshold, the kink can propagate along the whole\nchain (lower plot), with a velocity which is again a (fluctuating) balance of damping and forcing.\n\nFigure 7 addresses one of the main issues we want to\ndiscuss: the relevance of the information content for the\nexistence and characteristics of the threshold force. To\nthis end, it collects our observations regarding the existence of thresholds in two examples: a coding region\nand a non-coding region. We again see the existence of\nthreshold forces, in agreement with a description in terms\nof an effective potential. However, we do not observe any\nqualitative or otherwise relevant difference between the\nkink dynamics (or the effective potential) in the two regions. This is the case with all the regions we have analyzed. Therefore, the conjecture by Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Adame\net al. based on their Fibonacci results that information\n\n\f7\nmay lead to different kink dynamical properties is, at\nleast at the level of our simple model, not in agreement\nwith the simulation results. Of course, this is one example; although similar results are obtained for different coding and non-coding sequences, we can not discard\nthat the threshold behavior is statistically different in the\ntwo types of regions. However, from our simulations we\nconsider this possibility quite unlikely.\n\n(a)\n1\n0.8\n\nv\n\n0.6\nT=21\nT=34\nT=55\nT=89\nSequence\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nF\n\n(b)\nT = 21\nT = 34\nT = 55\nT = 89\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\nVeff\n\nHaving discarded the relevance of the genetic informacion to the determination of the threshold force, it is\ninteresting to proceed with the comparison between the\nprevious work on the Fibonacci chain and the present\nresults, in order to understand what is the difference\nand what leads to different conclusions. To this end,\nwe have simulated periodic systems with unit cell built\nfrom pieces of a genetic sequence, repeated to complete\na longer chain, much as was done with the Fk building\nblocks in [19] (see above). The sizes for the unit cells\nwere chosen to mimic the sizes for the Fibonacci iterations, and again the starting points were chosen in the\nsame position related to the beginning of a unit cell. The\nresults are collected in Fig. 8 (a). From this plot, we see\nthat the most important difference between the two cases\nis that in the actual DNA chain, the threshold value does\nchange much more for sequences with different unit cells\nthan in the Fibonacci case, and there is not a maximum\nvalue for the threshold force when increasing the sizes of\nthe unit cells.\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\nOne important point we want to stress is that the analytical approach in terms of collective coordinates and an\neffective potential is a very good picture of the observed\nphenomenology even in this, more realistic setting. In\nfact, the results in Fig. 8 (a) can be correlated with the\neffective potentials depicted in Fig. 8 (b). On the basis of\nthis scenario, we suggest that the reason for the difference\nbetween the two models lies in the larger diversity available for possible DNA chains. The fact that, in Fibonacci\nchains, sites of type qb are always isolated and that more\nthan two sites of type qa cannot be found together is\nvery restrictive as to the shapes and sizes of the peaks of\nwells of the potential felt by the kinks, giving rise to the\nFibonacci structure mentioned in section II C, and therefore the Fibonacci model cannot capture the richness of\nthe DNA model. This is clearly seen when comparing\nthe effective potential for the Fibonacci chains in Figs. 5\n(a) and (b) with that for the DNA chain in Fig. 8 (b).\nOn the other hand, when joining two unit cells in the\nDNA model, the local A-T/C-G concentration can vary\nmore than in the Fibonacci case (where it is restricted\nto be close to a golden mean ratio), so a lower well or a\nhigher peak may arise at the joining places. Finally, it\nis clear that considering longer and longer sequences of\nDNA increases the probability of finding longer repeated\nGC sequences, and hence of finding larger thresholds, as\ndiscussed above.\n\n0.2\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nn - n_T\nFIG. 8: (a) Velocity vs applied force for different periodic\nsystems formed by repeating as a unit cell n sites of the same\ncontig as in Fig. 6 beginning at site 114 241, with n = 21, 34,\n55 and 89 (as in the Fibonacci case) and for the whole sequence going from 114 100 to 115 100.

The present stage of the research was\nmotivated by previous results on chains given by aperiodic sequences [19], which led to the hypothesis that\nthe information content of the inhomogeneities might be\nrelevant for the dynamical behavior. While this general\nstatement cannot be ruled out at this stage (at least from\na probabilistic approach as discussed above), we believe\nthat at the level of the Englander model [10] the sim-\n\n\f8\nulations presented here do not confirm that hypothesis.\nSpecifically, we have not observed qualitative difference\nin the dynamics of kinks propagating along coding or\nnon-coding regions, which in principle prevents the use\nof this simple model as a genome sequencing tool. In this\nrespect, it is important to realize that unzipping experiments can not distinguish between the breaking of single\nbase pairs, as discussed in [9]. Therefore, the fact that\nkink pulling experiments or simulations do not discriminate coding from non-coding region would have a physical\nbasis, because such discrimination would require a much\nbetter resolution. On the other hand, we are becoming\nincreasingly aware that the function and information content of non-coding regions are far from well know, and\nit may well be that the dynamics in the two types of\nsequences is the same because the quantity of information is similar. Indeed, we are now beginning to realize\nthat the non-coding regions do have crucial implications\nin the DNA-protein connections, either by inhibiting the\nfabrications of proteins from DNA or by switching on\nand off specific genes [30]. This is certainly an interesting issue that deserves further attention. In this regard,\nit would be interesting to come back to the model with\nartificially designed sequences, with different information\ncontent (in the Shannon-Kolmogorov sense), in order to\nsettle definitely this question.\nEven if the answer to the relation between behavior\nunder applied forces and information content is finally\nnegative, there is another conclusion arising from our\nresearch that can be relevant from the genomical viewpoint. We have verified that the effective potential approach [19, 26, 28] to the dynamics of nonlinear excitations in DNA gives a very good description of the important points of the sequence, namely valleys and peaks.\nAlthough the precise dynamics of kinks is difficult to predict, and specifically, the identification of the relevant\nvalleys among all present in the sequence is not yet understood, this analytical approximation allows to identify\nthe possible stop positions as well as the barriers that\n\ncontrol the total opening (mechanical denaturation) of\nthe chain. In fact, the complicated structure of the effective potential is consistent with the mechanical unzipping dynamics as observed in experiments [22], characterized by a stick-slip behavior with large fluctuations in\nthe velocity (also reproduced by our simple model). On\nthe other hand, the comparison with the Fibonacci system suggests that the features of the effective potential\nthat are most relevant for the dynamics are the highest\npeaks and the deepest valleys, the total potential landscape being responsible only for finer details. This is\nalso true in the presence of thermal noise: Results from\nLangevin simulations show that very (in the scale of the\napplied forces) large temperatures do not change much\nthe threshold values [31]. This suggests that the effective\npotential may be a way to identify promoter sequences\nmuch simpler than the full simulations reported in [25].\nIn addition, the effective potential can also be used as\na tool to include in the gene identification procedure of\nYeramian [17] that may lead to results of similar quality\nwith much less computational effort. Of course, a detailed comparison with more complex models, such as the\nPeyrard-Bishop one [11, 12, 13] is needed to ascertain the\nusefulness of the effective potential picture. Work along\nthese lines is in progress.\n\n[1] A. C. Scott, Nonlinear Science (Oxford University, Oxford, 1999).\n[2] E. Fermi, J. R. Pasta and S.
