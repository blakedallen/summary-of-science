X is\ncalled amorphous if it has as many fusion schemes as possible. If X is symmetric, then it is\namorphous if and only if every partition of R containing {R0 } gives rise to a fusion scheme.\nHowever, if X is non-symmetric, then in order for a partition of R containing {R0 } to give rise\nto a fusion scheme, this partition has to be closed under taking inverse, i.e., it is admissible [6].\nSo, if X is non-symmetric, then it is amorphous if and only if every admissible partition of R\ngives rise to a fusion scheme.\nA. V. Ivanov ([8], see also [4]) classified symmetric amorphous association schemes with\nat least three classes: all basic graphs in such a scheme are strongly regular graphs of Latin\nsquare types, or they are all negative Latin square type. Association schemes with two classes\nare amorphous by definition and there are many examples in which the basic graphs are not\neither Latin square types. Hence the assumption \"at least three classes\" is essential. T. Ito, A.\nMunemasa and M. Yamada [6] classified commutative amorphous association schemes under the\nassumption \u03b8 + \u03c6 \u2265 3, where \u03b8 is the number of pairs of non-symmetric relations, and \u03c6 is the\nnumber of non-diagonal symmetric relations (see Section 2). The assumption \u03b8+\u03c6 \u2265 3 garantees\nthat their symmetrizations have at least three classes. What about association schemes with\n\u03b8 + \u03c6 \u2264 2?\nThis paper addresses the case (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (2, 0). Included in this case are four-class association\nschemes which have no non-diagonal symmetric relations. Association schemes with this property will be referred to as skew-symmetric. The symmetrizations of skew-symmetric schemes\n\n1\n\n\fwith four classes, as we will see, indeed have basic graphs of Latin square type or negative Latin\nsquare type. However, such schemes can not exist, due to the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. There is no skew-symmetric amorphous association scheme with 4 classes.\nSurprisingly, this simple result eleminates the existence of many amorphous association\nschemes.\nTheorem 2 (Main Theorem). There is no skew-symmetric amorphous association scheme with\nat least 4 classes.\nTheorem 1 answers a question put forward by E. Bannai and S.Y. Song ([2, p.395]) regarding\nthe existence of certain amorphous association schemes with 4 classes. The proofs of both theorems rely on Theorem 6, in which we determine the eigenmatrices of skew-symmetric schemes\nwith 4 classes.\nWe note that all association schemes in other cases of \u03b8 + \u03c6 < 3 are trivially amorphous.\nLet X be an association scheme with \u03b8 + \u03c6 < 3. If (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (0, 1), X is a complete graph. If\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1, 0), X is a doubly regular tournament. If (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (0, 2), X is equivalent to a pair\nof complementary strong regular graphs. Many chapters of books have been devoted to strong\nregular graphs (e.g. [3]). If (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1, 1), X is a non-symmetric association scheme with 3\nclasses, and examples of primitive ones are not abundant except the Liebler-Mena family [9] and\nsome examples in [10] (see [7] and the references there).\nIt is natural to ask if there exist non-commutative amorphous schemes. We rule out this\npossibility with an algebraic argument.\nThe general references are [1, 3] for association schemes and strongly regular graphs, and\n[4, 6, 15] for amorphous association schemes. In the rest of this paper, all association schemes\nare assumed to be commutative unless otherwise stated.\nAcknowledgment: The author would like to thank Professors Robert A.

X = (X, R) is called an association scheme with d classes (a d-class association\nscheme, or simply, a scheme) if the following axioms are satisfied:\n(i) R is a partition of X \u00d7 X and R0 = {(x, x) | x \u2208 X} is the diagonal relation.\n\n(ii) For i = 0, 1, . . . , d, the inverse RiT = {(y, x)|(x, y) \u2208 Ri } of Ri is also among the relations:\nRiT = Ri\u2032 for some i\u2032 (0 \u2264 i\u2032 \u2264 d).\n\n(iii) For any triple of i, j, k = 0, 1, . . . , d, there exists an integer pkij such that for all (x, y) \u2208 Rk ,\n|{z \u2208 X | (x, z) \u2208 Ri , (z, y) \u2208 Rj }| = pkij .\nThe integers pkij are called the intersection numbers. The integer ki = p0ii\u2032 is called the valency\nof Ri . In fact, for any x \u2208 X, ki = |{y \u2208 X| (x, y) \u2208 Ri }|.\nFurthermore, X is called commutative if pkij = pkji for all i, j, k.\nRi and Ri\u2032 are called paired relations. If i = i\u2032 , then Ri is called symmetric or self-paired.\nLet\n\u03b8 = |{{i, i\u2032}|i 6= i\u2032 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d}|, \u03c6 = |{i|i = i\u2032 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d}|.\n\n2\n\n\fX is called symmetric if all relations Ri are symmetric: \u03b8 = 0. Otherwise, X is said to be\nnon-symmetric. We call X skew-symmetric if R0 is the only self-paired relation: \u03c6 = 0.\nA partition \u039b0 , \u039b1 , . . . , \u039be of index set {0, 1, . . . , d} of R is called admissible [6] if \u039b0 = {0},\n\u039bi 6= \u2205 and \u039bTi = \u039bj for some j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 e), where \u039bT = {\u03b1\u2032 |\u03b1 \u2208 \u039b} is called the inverse of \u039b.\nWe may also talk about these properties in terms of the relations when it is convenient, which\nwe did at the beginning of the Introduction.\nLet R\u039bi = \u222a\u03b1\u2208\u039bi R\u03b1 . If (X, {R\u039bi }ei=0 ) is an association scheme, it is called a fusion scheme of\nX. In particular, the fusion scheme Xsym = (X, {R0 , Ri \u222a RiT }di=0 ) is called the symmetrization\nof X. X is amorphous if every admissible partition gives a fusion scheme. Note that if X is\nsymmetric, then every partition containing {0} is admissible by definition. Amorphous schemes\nare extremal in the sense they have as many fusion schemes as possible.\nLet us recall the (first) eigenmatrix P = (Pij ) of a commutative association scheme X =\n(X, {Ri }di=0 ). Let Ai and Ei (0 \u2264 i \u2264 d) be the adjacency matrices and primitive idempotents\nof X. Then the eigenmatrix P is a square matrix of order d + 1 defined by\nAj =\n\nd\nX\n\nPij Ei for j = 0, 1, . . . , d.\n\ni=0\n\nP is characterized by Aj Ei = Pij Ei for all i, j = 0, 1, . . . d. We may index the rows and columns\nof P by Ei and Ai (i = 0, 1, 2), respectively. Moreover, P0i = ki and Pi0 = 1 (0 \u2264 i \u2264 d).\nLet mi = rank Ei . Then Aj has eigenvalues P0j = kj , P1j , . . . , Pdj with multiplicities m0 =\n1, m1 , . . . md , respectively. The rows and columns of P satisfy the orthogonality relations:\nd\nX\n\nd\nX\nn\n1\nPji P ki =\n\u03b4jk ,\nk\nm\ni\nj\ni=0\n\nmi Pij P ik = nkj \u03b4jk ,\n\n(2.1)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere x is the complex conjugate of x and \u03b4 is the Kronecker symbol.\nThe numbers mj and plij can be calculated from P :\nmj =\n\nplij =\n\nn\n,\nd 1\nP\nPji P ji\ni=0 ki\n\nd\n1 X\nmh Phi Phj P hl .\nnkl\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nh=0\n\nIn the rest of this paper, the following theorem, referred as the Bannai-Muzychuk criterion\nfor fusion schemes, will be used repeatedly (see [2], [6]).\nTheorem 3. Let X = (X, {Ri }di=0 ) be a commutative association scheme. Let {\u039bi }ei=0 be an\nadmissible partition of the index set {0, 1, . . . , d}. Then {\u039bi }ei=0 gives rise to a fusion scheme\n(X, {R\u039bi }ei=0 ) if and only if there exists a dual partition {\u039b\u2217i }ei=0 of {0, 1, . . . , d} with \u039b\u22170 = {0}\nsuch that each (\u039b\u2217i , \u039bj ) block of the eigenmatrix P has constant row sum. Moreover, the constant\nrow sum of the (\u039b\u2217i , \u039bj )-block is the (i, j) entry of the eigenmatrix of the fusion scheme.\nNow we consider two-class association schemes. Let X = (X, {R0 , R1 , R2 }) be an association\nscheme. If X is non-symmetric, then R2 = R1T . Its eigenmatrix is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1\nk\u221a\nk\u221a\n\uf8ef\n\u22121 + \u2212n \u22121 \u2212 \u2212n \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n(2.4)\nP =\uf8ef 1\n\uf8fa,\n2\u221a\n2\u221a\n\uf8f0\n\u22121 \u2212 \u2212n \u22121 + \u2212n \uf8fb\n1\n2\n2\n\n3\n\n\fwhere n = |X| = 2k + 1.\nTwo-class symmetric schemes are closely related to strongly regular graphs. A regular graph\n(X, F ) with vertex set X, edge set F and valency k, is called strongly regular if\n\u03bb = |{z|(x, z) \u2208 F, (z, y) \u2208 F }|\nis constant for all (x, y) \u2208 F and\n\u03bc = |{z|(x, z) \u2208 F, (z, y) \u2208 F }|\nis constant for all (x, y) \u2208\n/ F (x 6= y). The numbers n = |X|, k, \u03bb, \u03bc are the parameters of this\ngraph.\nA strongly regular graph with parameters (n, k, \u03bb, \u03bc) is of (positive) Latin square type or\nnegative Latin square type if n = v 2 (a square) and either (i)\nk = g(v \u2212 1),\n\n\u03bb = (g \u2212 1)(g \u2212 2) + v \u2212 2,\n\n\u03bc = g(g \u2212 1),\n\nk = g(v + 1),\n\n\u03bb = (g + 1)(g + 2) \u2212 v \u2212 2,\n\n\u03bc = g(g + 1).\n\nor (ii)\nThey are denoted by Lg (v) and N Lg (v), respectively. Graphs with Lg (v) parameters can be\nconstructed with g \u2212 2 mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order v. Graphs with N Lg (v)\nparameters do exist: for example, the Clebsch graph is N L1 (4).\nFor a symmetric amorphous scheme X = (X, {Ri }di=0 ), each graph (X, Ri )(i 6= 0) is strongly\nregular. It was shown in [8, 4] that if d \u2265 3, all graphs (X, Ri )(i 6= 0) are strongly regular\ngraphs of Latin square type, or they are all negative Latin square type. The converse is also\ntrue ([14, Theorem 3]): if (X, Ri ), i = 1, . . . , d are strongly regular graphs of all Latin square\ntype or all negative Latin square type such that \u222adi=1 Ri = X \u00d7 X \u2212 R0 and Ri \u2229 Rj = \u2205\n(i 6= j), then (X, {Ri }di=0 ) is an amorphous association scheme. In [6], T. Ito et al. classified\ncommutative amorphous association schemes with \u03b8+\u03c6 \u2265 3 and determined their eigenmatrices\nand intersection numbers. They also constructed some amorphous schemes on Galois rings of\ncharacteristic 4.\nIf (X, R1 ) is a strongly regular graph with parameters (n, k1 , \u03bb, \u03bc), the complement (X, R2 )\nof (X, R1 ) is also strongly regular, where R2 = X \u00d7X \u2212R0 \u2212R1 . Furthermore, (X, {R0 , R1 , R2 })\nis a symmetric scheme, which has the following eigenmatrix:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1\n1 k1 k2\nt \uf8fb m1\nP =\uf8f0 1 r\n(2.5)\n1 s u\nm2 ,\nwhere t = \u2212r \u2212 1, u = \u2212s \u2212 1. The numbers k1 , r, s are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix\nA1 of R1 and r, s may be expressed in terms of n, k1 , \u03bb and \u03bc. Here, we write the multiplicities to\nthe right of P . Conversely, a two-class symmetric scheme gives rise to a pair of complementary\nstrongly regular graphs.\nNow we conclude this section with two lemmas that we will need later. In the rest of this\npaper, we always choose r \u2265 0 > s.\nLemma 4. Let \u0393 be a strong regular graph with eigenvalues k, r, s and multiplicities 1, m1 , m2 .\n(i) If m1 = m2 (hence k = m1 ), \u0393 is a strong regular graph with parameters n = 4\u03bc + 1,\nk = 2\u03bc, \u03bb = \u03bc \u2212 1. Such a graph is called a conference graph, denoted by C(n).\n\n(ii) If k = m1 , \u0393 is Lg (v) with v = r \u2212 s, g = \u2212s.\n\n(iii) If k = m2 , \u0393 is N Lg (v) with v = r \u2212 s, g = r.\n\n4\n\n\fOne can prove this lemma directly using [3, exercise 5, p.244]) or see Theorem 2.1 of [11]. If\nv is odd, we note that L 21 (v+1) (v) and N L 21 (v\u22121) (v) have identical parameters and both agree\nwith C(n) with the argument \u03bc = (v 2 \u2212 1)/4.\nWe state the next lemma without a proof since it is straightforward.\nLemma 5. Let X be a d-class association scheme with adjacency matrices Ai and primitive\nidempotents Ei .\n(i) If ATi = Aj , then P\u03b1i = P \u03b1j (0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 d). So, if ATi 6= Ai , Ai has at least one pair of\nnonreal eigenvalues that are complex conjugates.\n(ii) If EiT = Ej , then Pi\u03b1 = P j\u03b1 (0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 d). So, if EiT = Ei , then Pik are real for all k\n(0 \u2264 k \u2264 d), and if EiT 6= Ei , there are distinct \u03b1, \u03b2 such that P\u03b1i and P\u03b2i are nonreal\ncomplex conjugates.\n\n3\n\nEigenmatrices\n\nLet X = (X, {Ri }4i=0 ) be a skew-symmetric association scheme: (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (2, 0). It is commutative since any association scheme with at most 4 classes is commutative [5]. Up to a\npermutation, we may assume R4 = R1T and R3 = R2T . Let Xsym = (X, {R0 , R1 \u222a R4 , R2 \u222a R3 }),\nthe symmetrization of X. We will determine the eigenmatrix of X from that of Xsym .\nei and E\nei (0 \u2264 i \u2264 2) be the adjacency matrices and the primitive idempotents of Xsym ,\nLet A\nrespectively. Suppose that the eigenmatrix Pe of Xsym has form (2.5):\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 k1 k2\n1\nt \uf8fb m1 .\nPe = \uf8f0 1 r\n1 s u\nm2\n\nIn the rest of this paper, we assume that r \u2265 0 > s.\nS. Y. Song [13] mentioned that up to permutation of rows and columns, a feasible eigenmatrix\nof X can be described as follows:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1\n1 k/2 (n \u2212 k \u2212 1)/2 (n \u2212 1 \u2212 k)/2 k/2\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 1\n\u03c4\n\u03c1\nm\n\u03c1\n\u03c4\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u03c9\n\u03c3 \uf8fa\n\u03c9\nP =\uf8ef\n(3.1)\n\uf8fa (n \u2212 m \u2212 1)/2 ,\n\uf8ef 1 \u03c3\n\uf8f0 1 \u03c3\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c3 \uf8fb (n \u2212 m \u2212 1)/2\n1\n\u03c1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c1\nm\n\nwhere the pair \u03c1 and \u03c9 or the pair \u03c4 and \u03c3 are nonreal. He also gave a one-sentence explanation.\nHere, we will prove Song's observation and determined the entries of P . Let P be the eigenmatrix\nof X:\nP = [Pij ]0\u2264i,j\u22644 .\nSince A4 = AT1 , by Lemma 5, A1 has at least one pair of nonreal eigenvalues. There are two\ncases to consider:\n(1) A1 has precisely one pair of nonreal eigenvalues \u03c1, \u03c1. By Theorem 3, \u03c1 + \u03c1 = r or s.\nSuppose \u03c1 + \u03c1 = r. We may arrange the primitive idempotents Ei of X such that A1 E1 =\n\u03c1E1 , A4 E4 = \u03c1E4 . Hence E4 = E1T . By Lemma 5, P21 , P24 , P31 and P34 are all real, and\nP21 = P24 , P31 = P34 . Consider the remaining two primitive idempotents E2 , E3 6= E0 . Then\nwe have either E3 = E2T or Ei = EiT (i = 2, 3), and the latter can not occur as we will see.\nSuppose Ei = EiT (i = 2, 3). By Lemma 5, the second and third rows of P have all real\ne1 = A1 + A4 , P21 + P24 , P31 + P34 \u2208 {r, s} again by Theorem 3. We must have\nentries. Since A\nP21 +P24 6= P31 +P34 . Otherwise, the second and third rows of P are identical, which contradicts\nthat P is nonsingular. We may assume without loss of generality that P21 = P24 = r/2,\n\n5\n\n\fP31 = P34 = s/2. Since A2 and A3\nfollowing form:\n\uf8ee\n1\n\uf8ef 1\n\uf8ef\nP =\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 1\n\uf8f0 1\n1\n\nhave a pair of nonreal eigenvalues \u03c4 and \u03c4 , P has the\n\uf8f9\n1\nn1\nn2\nn2\nn1\nf\n\u03c4\n\u03c1 \uf8fa\n\u03c1\n\u03c4\n\uf8fa 1\nr/2 t/2 t/2 r/2 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa f2 ,\ns/2 u/2 u/2 s/2 \uf8fb f3\nf1\n\u03c1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c1\n\nwhere ni are the valencies of X and 2ni = ki . Now we calculate the multiplicity f2 using (2.2):\nf2 =\n\nn\n4\nP\n\ni=0\n\n=\n\n1\nni P2i P 2i\n\nn\n\n1+\n\n2\nn1\n\n\u0001\nr 2\n2\n\n+\n\n2\nn2\n\n\u0001\nt 2\n2\n\n=\n\nn\n1+\n\nr2\nk1\n\n+\n\nt2\nk2\n\n,\n\nwhich is m1 by (2.2). Similarly, we can obtain f3 = m2 . So, f1 = 0, impossible.\nNow we have E3 = E2T . Since E2T 6= E2 and P21 , P41 are real, by Lemma 5, P22 , P23 are\nnonreal and P22 = P 23 . Since AT2 = A3 , P32 = P 22 = P 33 again by Lemma 5. Let \u03c9 = P22 . So\nP has the following form:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1 n1 n2 n2 n1\n\uf8ef 1 \u03c1\n\u03c4\n\u03c1 \uf8fa\n\u03c4\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n(3.2)\nP = \uf8ef 1 s/2 \u03c9 \u03c9 s/2 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8f0 1 s/2 \u03c9 \u03c9 s/2 \uf8fb\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c1\n1 \u03c1\n\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03c9 are both nonreal, \u03c1 + \u03c1 = r, \u03c9 + \u03c9 = u and \u03c4 + \u03c4 = t.\nSuppose \u03c1 + \u03c1 = s. Replacing s by r in (3.2), we obtain matrix P for this case, in which \u03c1\nand \u03c9 are both nonreal, \u03c1 + \u03c1 = s, \u03c4 + \u03c4 = u and \u03c9 + \u03c9 = t.\n(2) A1 has two pairs of nonreal eigenvalues: \u03c1, \u03c1, and \u03c3, \u03c3.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that \u03c1 + \u03c1 = r, \u03c3 + \u03c3 = s, and the first column\nof P is (n2 , \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c1)T . So P has form (3.1), where \u03c4 and \u03c9 can not be both real by Lemma 5.\nWe know from the above analysis that P has the form asserted in (3.1). Let\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 n1 n2 n2 n1\n1\n\uf8ef 1 \u03c1\n\uf8fa f1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nP =\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 1 \u03c3 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c3 \uf8fa f2 .\n\uf8f0 1 \u03c3 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c3 \uf8fb f2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c1\nf1\n1 \u03c1\n\nNow we are ready to determine \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c4 and \u03c3. Set\n\u03c1=\n\n\u221a\n1\n(r + \u2212y),\n2\n\n\u03c4=\n\n\u221a\n1\n(t + \u2212z),\n2\n\n\u03c3=\n\n\u221a\n1\n(s + \u2212b),\n2\n\nwhere y, z, b \u2265 0. So, the first row and column\u221aof P are fixed, and hence the fourth row and\ncolumn by Lemma 5. Therefore, \u03c9 = 12 (u \u00b1 \u2212c) for some c \u2265 0. There are two cases to\nconsider:\n\u221a\n\nCase (i) \u03c9 = 21 (u + \u2212c). Applying the first orthogonality relation to the first row of P , we\n\nobtain\n\n1+\n\nn\n2\u03c1\u03c1 2\u03c4 \u03c4\n+\n= .\nn1\nn2\nf1\n\nSubstituting \u03c1 and \u03c4 into the above equation, we obtain\n1+\n\n1 2\nn\n1 2\n(r + y) +\n(t + z) = .\n2n1\n2n2\nf1\n\n6\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fApplying the first orthogonality relation to the first row of Pe , we obtain\n1+\n\nt2\nn\nr2\n+\n=\n.\nk1\nk2\nm1\n\n(3.4)\n\nNote that 2ni = ki and 2fi = mi . By (3.3) and (3.4), we have\n\nSimilarly, we can obtain\n\nz\nn\ny\n+\n=\n.\nk1\nk2\nm1\n\n(3.5)\n\nb\nc\nn\n+\n=\n.\nk1\nk2\nm2\n\n(3.6)\n\nApplying the first orthogonality relation to the second and third rows of P and Pe, we obtain\n1+\n\n1\n1\n(\u03c1\u03c3 + \u03c1\u03c3) +\n(\u03c4 \u03c9 + \u03c4 \u03c9) = 0,\nn1\nn2\n\n1+\n\ntu\nrs\n+\n= 0.\nk1\nk2\n\nSubstituting \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c4 , \u03c9 and the second equation into the first equation, we obtain\n\u221a\n\u221a\nby\ncz\n+\n= 0.\nk1\nk2\nIt follows that by = 0 and cz = 0. Since P is nonsingular, we must have either (y, c) = (0, 0) or\n(z, b) = (0, 0), but not both.\nSuppose (z, b) = (0, 0). By equations (3.5) and (3.6),\ny=\n\nnk1\n,\nm1\n\nc=\n\nnk2\n.\nm2\n\n(3.7)\n\nSuppose (y, c) = (0, 0). By equations (3.5) and (3.6),\nz=\n\nnk2\n,\nm1\n\nb=\n\nnk1\n.\nm2\n\n(3.8)\n\nNote that in each case above, Pe determines P uniquely.\n\u221a\n\nCase (ii) \u03c9 = 21 (u \u2212 \u2212c). If c = 0, then y = 0. This case has been treated in Case (i).\n\nNow, assume c > 0. Since \u03c9 is nonreal, \u03c1 is also nonreal: y > 0. Note that equations (3.5) and\n(3.6) still hold.\nNow, applying the first orthogonality relation to the second and third rows of P and simplifying it in a similar way, we can obtain\n\u221a\n\u221a\nby\ncz\n\u2212\n= 0.\n(3.9)\nk1\nk2\nNote if z = 0, then b = 0. This has been handled previously. Now we assume z > 0. Hence,\nb > 0. Therefore, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c4 , and \u03c3 are all nonreal, and b, c, y, and z satisfy equations (3.5), (3.6),\nand (3.9).\nWe summarize the above discussion in the following theorem.\nTheorem 6. Let X = (X, {R0 , R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 }) be a skew-symmetric association scheme with\nR1 = R4T and R2 = R3T .

Let X = (X, {R0 , R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 }) be a skewsymmetric amorphous scheme, whose eigenmatrix P is given in Theorem 6.\nSuppose that P is given by Theorem 6(i). Since X is amorphous, R0 , R1 \u222a R2 , R3 \u222a R4 gives\nrise to a skew-symmetric association scheme, which has eigenmatrix (2.4). By Theorem 3,\n!\nr\n\u221a\n\u22121 + \u2212n\nnk1\n1\nr+t+ \u2212\n=\n.\n\u03c1+\u03c4 =\n2\nm1\n2\nSo m1 = k1 . By Lemma 4(ii), (X, R1 \u222a R4 ) is Lg (v) with v = r \u2212 s, g = \u2212s.\nThe i-th intersection matrix Bi is a square matrix of order d + 1 whose (j, l) entry is plij .\nUsing (2.3), we can obtain\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u03bb+r\nk1 (k1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 \u2212 t) k1 (k1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 \u2212 t)\n\u03bb \u2212 3r\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n4\n4k\n4k\n4\n2\n2\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nk1 \u2212 \u03bc + s\nk1 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 s\nk1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 \u2212 t \uf8fa\nk1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 + t\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8fa\nB1 = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa.\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nk1 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 s\nk1 \u2212 \u03bc + s\nk1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 \u2212 t \uf8fa\nk1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 + t\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0 k\n\uf8fb\n\u03bb+r\nk1 (k1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 + t) k1 (k1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1 + t)\n\u03bb+r\n1\n2\n4\n4k2\n4k2\n4\n\nFrom p112 \u2212 p412 = 2t/4 and p212 \u2212 p312 = 2s/4 we readily deduce that t and s are even integers.\ns(s+2)+2r\nSince r + t + 1 = 0, r is odd. On the other hand, p111 = \u03bb+r\n. So r is even because\n4 =\n4\ns(s + 2) is divisible by 4, a contradiction.\nSuppose that P is given by Theorem 6(ii). In a similarly way, we can deduce k1 = m2 and\nhence (X, R1 \u222a R4 ) is N Lg (v) with v = r \u2212 s, g = r. The first intersection matrix for this case\ncan be obtained from the above B1 by interchanging r and s, and t and u. We can readily deduce\nr(r+2)+2s\n, s is even, a contradiction.\nthat r and u are even and s is odd. Since p111 = \u03bb+s\n4 =\n4\n\n8\n\n\fSuppose that P is given by Theorem 6(iii). In this case, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c4, \u03c3 are all nonreal. since X\nis amorphous, R0 , R1 \u222a R2 , R3 \u222a R4 determines a non-symmetric association scheme, which has\neigenmatrix (2.4). So,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22121 + \u2212n\n1\n,\n\u03c1 + \u03c4 = (r + t + \u2212y + \u2212z) =\n2\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(X,\nand hence \u2212y + \u2212z = \u2212n. Similarly,\n\u221a\n\u221a {R0 , R1 \u222a R3 , R2 \u222a R4 }) is non-symmetric\n\u221a\nassociation scheme and thus \u2212y \u2212 \u2212z = \u00b1 \u2212n. These equations imply either y = 0 or\nz = 0, a contradiction. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.\n\u0003\nNow we prove the main theorem. Suppose that X is a skew-symmetric amorphous scheme\nwith more than 4 classes. X has a skew-symmetric fusion scheme with 4 classes, which can not\nexist by Theorem 1 because this fusion scheme is again amorphous. This completes the proof.\n\n5\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nAs we mentioned in the Introduction that there does not exist any non-commutative amorphous\nscheme. We now give a short proof of this result. By the main theorem, we may assume \u03c6 \u2265 1.\nSince association schemes with at most 4 classes are commutative, we may assume \u03b8 + \u03c6 \u2265 3.\nWe first treat the minimal cases (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1, 3) or (2, 1) and the general case will then follow.\nSuppose that X is a non-symmetric amorphous scheme with (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1, 3) or (2, 1). If X is\nnon-commutative, then the adjacency algebra generated by the adjacency matrices of X over the\ncomplex numbers C is non-commutative of dimension 6. It is semisimple and thus is isomorphic\nto direct sum of full matrix algebras of degree 1,1 and 2:\nC \u2295 C \u2295 M2 (C).\nX has a 4-class fusion scheme F, which is commutative. So the adjacency algebra of F is\ncommutative of dimension 5. On the other hand, M2 (C) can not have commutative subalgebras\nof dimension 3 and thus the adjacency algebra of X has no commutative subalgebras of dimension\n5, which is a contradiction. Therefore, X is commutative. (In fact, we have proved that a noncommutative scheme with 5 classes can not have a 4-class fusion scheme.)\nLet X be an amorphous non-symmetric scheme with \u03b8 + \u03c6 > 4, \u03b8 \u2265 1. Any two adjacency\nmatrices of X are among the adjacency matrices of some fusion scheme with (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1, 3) or\n(2, 1). So the adjacency matrices of X commute pairwisely and thus X is commutative.\nWe note that the minimal cases can also be handled by a careful analysis of their intersection\nnumbers, which shows that the intersection numbers in each case coincide with those of certain\ncommutative amorphous scheme. In fact, using the notation in [6], amorphous schemes with\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (1, 3) belong to Lg1 ;g2 ,g3 ,g4 (v) or N Lg1 ;g2 ,g3 ,g4 (v), and amorphous schemes with (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n(2, 1) belong to Lg1 ,g2 ;g3 (v) or N Lg1 ,g2 ;g3 (v).\nWe conclude with some remarks:\n\u2022 E. R. van Dam and M. Muzychuk [15] gave an excellent survey of symmetric amorphous\nassociation schemes. Among many results, they gave all known constructions and enumeration of such schemes with vertices up to 49 vertices. However, there has not been much\nwork done with the non-symmetric counterpart except [6].\n\u2022 In light of Theorem 6, it is interesting to study skew-symmetric schemes with 4 classes.\nWe are working on it in another paper.\n\u2022 In the literature (e.g. [4],[8],[15]), an association scheme is call amorphic if every partition\nof R containing {R0 } gives rise to a fusion scheme. The notion of admissible partition\nwas introduced and the term amorphous was used by T. Ito, et al. in [6]. For symmetric schemes, the two notions are equivalent. Any association scheme with two classes is\n\n9\n\n\ftrivially amorphic by definition. It is easy to see that any amorphic scheme with at least\nthree classes is symmetric.\n\u2022 I.N. Ponomarenko an A.R. Barghi [12] recently introduced amorphic C-algebras by axiomatizing the property that each partition of a standard basis leads to a fusion algebra.\nJust like association schemes, each amorphic C-algebra of dimension \u2265 4 is symmetric.\nThey showed that each amorphic C-algebra is determined up to isomorphism by the multiset of its degrees (valencies in the case of association scheme) and an additional integer\n\u01eb = \u00b11 (reflecting the positive or negative Latin square type). Since our focus here is\nnon-symmetric association schemes, our work has little overlap with that of [12] .\n\nReferences\n[1] E. Bannai and T.
