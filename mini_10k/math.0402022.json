November 2018\nAbstract\nUsing methods from [10], we study families of Hopf algebra structures\non coloured trees.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past years more and more examples of combinatorial Hopf algebras appeared in the mathematical literature (cf. Kreimer [7], ConnesKreimer [3], Loday-Ronco [8], Brouder-Frabetti [1]). In most cases these\nHopf algebras are constructed one at a time. One of the authors [10]\nconstructs such Hopf algebras in families stemming from Hopf operads,\nrather than as isolated examples. For example, the Connes-Kreimer Hopf\nalgebra of rooted trees and its planar analogon (cf. Foissy[4] for a detailed account) are examples related by a change of operad (see [10]).\nThe non-planar version corresponds to a particular coproduct based on\nthe commutative operad, whereas the planar version corresponds to its\nanalogue for the associative operad. For the construction of some other\npreviously studied Hopf algebras of trees in the framework of this paper\nwe refer to [11].\nThe paper starts (Section 2) with the definition of the initial pair of\na commutative algebra together with an n-ary map (Cn , \u03bbn ) and applies\nthe arguments of [10] to show that there exists a family of Hopf algebra\nstructures on Cn . Section 3 identifies Cn with the symmetric algebra on\nrooted trees with n-coloured edges. Consequently the Hopf algebras constructed in Section 2 are bialgebras of trees. Section 4 then derives an\nexplicit formula for the corresponding coproducts in terms of trees. Section 5 gives an explicit description of the Lie algebra of primitive elements\nof the dual Hopf algebra and gives a criterion when this is the associated\nLie algebra of a pre-Lie algebra. Section 6 interprets the family of coproducts in terms of deformation theory. Finally, Section 7 sketches the more\ngeneral framework of Hopf operads and lists the results obtained when\none starts from associative instead of commutative algebras.\nAcknowledgements: During the period in which this article was\nwritten, PvdL was supported by Marie Curie Training Site Fellowship\n\n1\n\n\fHPMT-2000-00075 (Centre de Recerca Matem\u00e0tica, Barcelona).\n\n2 Hopf algebras structures from initial\nobjects\nFor definiteness, we work in the category of vector spaces over a field k\nof characteristic zero. (However, with the exception of Sections 5 an 6,\nour arguments apply in a much more general context of modules over an\nalgebra in any symmetric monoidal additive category.) By algebra we will\nalways mean associative algebra with unit.\n2.1 Definition A commutative n-algebra is a pair (A, \u03b1), consisting of a\ncommutative algebra A and a linear map \u03b1 : A\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A. A morphism of\nn-algebras f : (A, \u03b1) \u2212\u2192 (B, \u03b2) is an algebra homomorphism f : A \u2212\u2192 B\nsuch that \u03b2 \u25e6 f \u2297n = f \u25e6 \u03b1. We will write Cn for the category of these\nn-algebras. For general reasons, this category Cn has an initial object, the\nfree n-algebra on the empty set of generators. This initial algebra will be\ndenoted by (Cn , \u03bbn ). It is completely characterised (up to isomorphism)\nby the property that any n-algebra (A, \u03b1) admits a unique morphism\n(Cn , \u03bbn ) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03b1). We will give an explicit description of this initial\nalgebra in Proposition 3.2 below.\nThis section introduces Hopf algebra structures on Cn of a specific\ntype. First we need a notation. If (A, \u03b1) \u2208 Cn is a commutative nalgebra and \u03c31 , \u03c32 : A\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A are two linear maps, define the linear\nmap (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) : (A \u2297 A)\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A \u2297 A as\n(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) = (\u03c31 \u2297 \u03b1 + \u03b1 \u2297 \u03c32 ) \u25e6 \u03c4.\n(Here \u03c4 : (A\u22972 )\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A\u2297n \u2297 A\u2297n is the isomorphism that separates the\nfirst and second tensor factors from A\u22972 .)\nWe are going to use this in the context where (A, \u03b1) is the initial\nn-algebra (Cn , \u03bbn ). First note that (Cn , \u03bbn ) is an augmented algebra.\nIndeed, the ground field k is naturally an n-algebra when equipped with\nthe zero map k\u2297n \u2212\u2192 k. So by initiality of (Cn , \u03bbn ), there is a unique\nmorphism of n-algebras \u03b5 : (Cn , \u03bb) \u2212\u2192 (k, 0).\nFor any pair of n-ary linear maps \u03c31 , \u03c32 : Cn\u2297n \u2212\u2192 Cn as above there\nis a unique morphism \u2206 : (Cn , \u03bbn ) \u2212\u2192 (Cn \u2297 Cn , (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )) in Cn . That is,\na unique algebra morphism \u2206 such that the diagram\n\u03bb\n\nCn\u2297n\n\n// Cn\n\n\u2206\u2297n\n\n\u000f\u000f\n(Cn \u2297 Cn )\n\n\u2206\n\n(\u03c3 ,\u03c3 )\n\u2297n 1 2\n\ncommutes.\n\n2\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n// Cn \u2297 Cn\n\n\f2.2 Theorem Let n \u2208 N, \u03bbn and Cn be defined as above.\nCn\u2297n \u2212\u2192 Cn for i = 1, 2 be linear maps. If both \u03c3i satisfy\n\u01eb \u25e6 \u03c3i = \u01eb\u2297n ,\n\nLet \u03c3i :\n\nand\n\n\u2206 \u25e6 \u03c3i = (\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3i ) \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u2206\u2297n ;\nthen there exists a unique bialgebra structure on Cn such that \u2206 \u25e6 \u03bb =\n(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) \u25e6 \u2206\u2297n and \u03b5 \u25e6 \u03bb = 0.\nProof The proof that this provides a bialgebra structure is completely analogous to the case where n = 1, treated in [10].\nQED\n\n2.3 Remark We will see in the next section that the initial algebra Cn\nhas a natural grading. The coalgebra structure given by a pair of maps\n\u03c31 and \u03c32 will respect this grading if these maps \u03c31 and \u03c32 do. In this\ncase there exists an antipode for the bialgebra structure. A special case\nof this occurs in Theorems 4.2 and 4.4 below.\n2.4 Remark The algebras Cn together form a simplicial algebra. The\nsimplicial operations di : Cn \u2212\u2192 Cn\u22121 and si : Cn \u2212\u2192 Cn+1 are the\nalgebra homomorphisms determined by\nd0 (\u03bbn )(x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03bc(x1 , \u03bbn\u22121 (x2 , . . . , xn ))\ndi (\u03bbn )(x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03bbn (x1 , . . . , \u03bc(xi , xi+1 ), . . . , xn )\n\n(i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1)\n\ndn (\u03bbn )(x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03bc(\u03bb(x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ), xn )\nsi (\u03bbn )(x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03bbn+1 (x1 , . . . , xi , 1, xi+1 , . . . , xn )\n\n(i = 0, . . . , n),\n\nsimilar to the formulas for the Hochschild complex.\n\n3\n\nInitial algebras and trees\n\n3.1 Definition A rooted tree is an isomorphism class t of finite partially\nordered sets which\n(i). have a minimal element r (\u2200x 6= r : r < x), called the root, and\n(ii). satisfy the tree condition that (y 6= z) \u2227 (y < x) \u2227 (z < x) implies\n(y < z) \u2228 (z < y).\nIn general, we will not be very precise in distinguishing between an\nisomorphism class t and any of the posets which represent it; in particular,\nwe will often use t to denote to a representing poset, and refer to it as a\ntree.\nThe elements of a tree are called vertices. A pair of vertices v < w is\ncalled an edge if there is no vertex x such that v < x < w. The number\nof vertices of a tree t is denoted by |t|. A path from x to y in a tree is\na sequence (xi )i of elements x = xn > xn\u22121 > . . . > x1 > x0 = y of\nmaximal length. We will say that x is above y in a tree if there is a path\nfrom x to y.\n\n3\n\n\fA forest is a finite (possibly empty) multiset (i.e. a set with multiplicities) of trees. A subforest of a tree or forest is a subset of vertices with\nthe induced partial order.\nIn the sequel we need trees with coloured edges. These are isomorphism\nclasses of posets as above, equipped with a function from the set of edges\nto a fixed set of colours. The isomorphisms are required to respect the\ncolours. In particular, an n-coloured tree is such a tree whose edges are\ncoloured by the set {1, .., n} of colours. We will write Tn for the vector\nspace spanned by the set of such n-coloured trees.\n3.2 Proposition There is a natural algebra isomorphism between the initial n-algebra Cn and the symmetric algebra S(Tn ) on the set of n-coloured\ntrees.\nProof The symmetric algebra S(Tn ) can be identifyed with the vector\nspace spanned by the set of n-coloured forests, with the unit represented\nby the empty forest and the product by the disjoint union of forests. There\nis an operation\n\u03bb : S(Tn )\u2297n \u2212\u2192 S(Tn )\nwhich takes an n-tuple of n-coloured forests f1 , . . . , fn , and combines them\ninto a single n-coloured tree by adding a new root, while connecting this\nnew root to each of the roots in the forest fi by an edge of colour i.\nThis operation makes S(Tn ) into an object of the category Cn . Since\ninitial objects are unique up to isomorphism in any category, it now suffices\nto prove that S(Tn ) is initial in Cn .\nTo this end, let (A, \u03b1) be any object of Cn , where \u03b1 : A\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A.\nDefine a morphism\n\u03c6 : (S(Tn ), \u03bb) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03b1)\nby induction on trees and forests. If f = t1 * . . . * tk is a forest consisting\nof k trees, then \u03c6(f ) = \u03c6(t1 ) * . . . * \u03c6(tk ), so it suffices to define \u03c6 on\ntrees. If t is a tree consisting of a root only, then \u03c6(t) = \u03b1(1, . . . , 1). If t\nconsists of a root r onto which an n-tuple of n-coloured forests f1 , . . . , fn\nis attached by joining the root of each tree in fi to r via an edge of colour\ni, then \u03c6(t) = \u03b1(\u03c6(f1 ), . . . , \u03c6(fn )). It is straightforward to check that\n\u03c6 : (S(Tn ), \u03bb) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03b1) thus defined is indeed a morphism in Cn , and is\nthe unique such.\nQED\n\n4\n\nHopf algebras of trees\n\nIn this section, we study a particular example of a family of Hopf algebras\nwhich can be obtained by the general method of Theorem 2.2.\n4.1 Example For any choice of qi j \u2208 k for all j \u2264 n, the maps\n|t |\n\n|t |\n\n\u03c3i (t1 , . . . , tn ) = qi 11 * . . . * qi nn t1 * . . . * tn\n\n4\n\nfor i = 1, 2\n\n\fdefine a bialgebra structure on S(Tn ). Here and in the sequel |f | denotes\nthe number of vertices in the forest corresponding to f \u2208 S(Tn ), while the\nassociative multiplication on S(Tn ) is denoted by *.\nBelow we write \u2206(fi ) =\na basis.\n\nP\n\nfi\u2032 \u2297 fi\u2032\u2032 reminiscent of the form \u2206 takes in\n\n4.2 Theorem The symmetric algebra S(Tn ) on n-coloured trees has a\nnatural family of graded connected Hopf algebra structures, indexed by\nsequences (q11 , . . . , q1n , q21 , . . . , q2n ) \u2208 k2n . The grading is with respect\nto the number of vertices of the trees. An inductive description of the\ncoproduct is given by\nX |f \u2032 |\n|f \u2032 |\n\u2206(\u03bb(f1 , . . . , fn )) =\nq111 * . . . * q1nn * f1\u2032 * . . . * fn\u2032 \u2297 \u03bb(f1\u2032\u2032 , . . . , fn\u2032\u2032 )\nX\n|f \u2032\u2032 |\n|f \u2032\u2032 |\n+\n\u03bb(f1\u2032 , . . . , fn\u2032 ) \u2297 q211 * . . . * q2nn * f1\u2032\u2032 * . . . * fn\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhere \u03bb(f1 , . . . , fn ) is the rooted tree obtained for n forests f1 , . . . , fn by\nadding a new root and connecting each of the roots of trees in fi to the\nnew root by an edge of colour i, and where |fi | is the number of vertices\nin the forest fi .\n\nProof The bialgebra structures are a direct translation of Example\n4.1 to the language of trees of Proposition 3.2. The bialgebra S(Tn ) is\ngraded connected with respect to the grading |.|. It is well known (cf.\nMilnor and Moore [9]) that any graded connected bialgebra admits an\nantipode.\nQED\n\nWe now turn to the question of finding a more direct decription of\nthese Hopf algebra structures. Fix n \u2208 N. For i = 1, 2 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, let\nqij \u2208 k, and define for ti \u2208 S(Tn )\nY |t |\n(4.1)\n\u03c3i (t1 , . . . tn ) = ( qijj ) * t1 * . . . * tn .\nj\n\nAny rooted tree has a natural partial ordering on its vertices in which the\nroot is the minimal element. A subforest s of a rooted tree t is a subset of\nthe partially ordered set (representing) t with the induced partial ordering.\nFor v \u2208 s we denote by pk (v, s, t) the number of edges of colour k in the\npath in t from v to the root of t that have their lower vertex in sc . For\nforests t we define pk (v, s, t) as pk (v, s \u2229 t\u2032 , t\u2032 ), where t\u2032 is the connected\ncomponent of t containing v. There is an easy but useful lemma on the\ncalculus of the pk .\n4.3 Lemma Let t and s be subforests of a forest u.

The formula is trivial for the empty tree.\nLet t = \u03bb(x1 , . . . , xn ) be a tree and suppose (as the induction hypothesis)\nthat the formula holds for all trees with less then |t| vertices. Since \u2206 is\nan algebra morphism, it is clear the formula also holds for the forests xi\nsince these consist of trees with less than |t| vertices. Subforests of t are\neither of the form s = \u222ai si , a (disjoint) union of subforests of the xi , or of\nthe form s = r \u222a (\u222ai si ), a (disjoint) union of subforests of the xi together\nwith the root.

Putting\nthese together proves the formula for the coproduct.\nLet A be a graded connected bialgebra. The augmentation ideal of A\nL\nis \u0100 = n\u22651 An . The antipode on A applied to x \u2208 \u0100 is given by\nS(x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n \u0304 (k) (x),\n(\u22121)k+1 \u03bc(k) \u25e6 \u2206\n\nk=0\n\n \u0304 = \u2206\u2212(id\u22971+1\u2297id), and \u03bc(0) = id = \u2206\n \u0304 (0) , and \u03bc(k) : A\u2297k+1 \u2212\u2192\nwhere \u2206\n(k)\n\u2297k+1\n \u0304\nA and \u2206\n: A \u2212\u2192 A\nare defined using (co)associativity for k > 0\n \u0304 (0) . (The sum in the formula for S(x) is of course finite,\nand \u03bc(0) = id = \u2206\nand stops at k for a homogeneous element x of degree k.) As a special\ncase, consider S(Tn ) with the coproduct just described. This proves the\nresult.\nQED\n\n4.5 Example The Hopf algebra C1 with the coproduct defined by q11 = 1\nand q21 = 0 is the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees [7, 3, 10].\n\n5\n\nPrimitives of the dual\n\nSince S(Tn ) is commutative, we know by the Milnor-Moore Theorem [9]\nthat the graded linear dual S(Tn )\u2217 is the universal enveloping algebra of\nthe Lie algebra of its primitive elements. The result below provides an\nexplicit formula for the Lie bracket on the these primitive elements.\n5.1 Corollary Let S(Tn ) be a the symmetric algebra on rooted trees with\nn-coloured edges, and let \u2206 be the coproduct defined by (q11 , . . . , q2n ) \u2208 k2n\n(cf. Theorem 4.4). The graded dual S(Tn )\u2217 is the universal enveloping\nalgebra of the Lie algebra which as a vector space is spanned by elements\nDt , where t is a rooted tree in S(Tn ). The bracket is given by [Ds , Dt ] =\nDt \u2022 Ds \u2212 Ds \u2022 Dt , where\nX X\nq(s, w)Dw .\nDt \u2022 Ds =\nw s\u2282w, sc =t\n\nIn this formula, the first sum ranges over all rooted trees w, and the second\nsum over subtrees of w which are isomorphic to s and whose complement\nsc is isomorphic to t.\nProof For any cocommutative Hopf algebra we can define an operation \u2022 on the primitive elements, such that its commutator is the Lie\nbracket on primitive elements: Simply define \u2022 as the truncation of the\n\n7\n\n\fproduct at degree > 1, with respect to the primitive filtration F . In this\ncase, Fm Cn\u2217 is spanned by the elements Du dual to forests u consisting of\nat most m trees. The product in S(Tn )\u2217 is determined by the coproduct\nin S(Tn ). For forest u, we can write the multiplication in Cn\u2217 as\n(Dt Ds )(u) = (Dt \u2297 Ds )\u2206(u),\nthus, for a fixed u we get a contribution q(u, s)Du for every subtree isomorphic to s in u with t as complementary forest. When we then restrict\nto the primitive part (i.e. the part where u is a tree as well), we conclude\nthat Dt \u2022 Ds is given by the desired formula.\nQED\n\nRecall (cf. Chapoton and Livernet [2]) that a pre-Lie algebra is vector\nspace L together with a bilinear operation \u2022 satisfying the identity\n(x \u2022 y) \u2022 z \u2212 x \u2022 (y \u2022 z) = (x \u2022 z) \u2022 y \u2212 x \u2022 (z \u2022 y).\nThe the free pre-Lie algebra Ln on n generators is given by the vector\nspace spanned by rooted trees with vertices labelled by elements of the\nset {1, 2, . . . , n}. The pre-Lie algebra product is given by grafting trees:\nFor t and s trees, and v a vertex in t, denote by t\u25e6v s the tree obtained from\nt and s by attaching the root of s to vertex v in t by a new edge. Grafting\npreserves the labeling of the vertices. The pre-Lie algebra structure on\nLn is given by,\nX\nt\u2022s=\nt \u25e6v s\nv\u2208t\n\nfor trees s and t.\nBelow we denote by \u03c7S the characteristic function of a subset S \u2282 X\nwhich has value 1 on S and value 0 on X \u2212 S, and denote the primitive\nelements of a coalgebra C by P (C).\n\n5.2 Theorem Let p \u2282 {1, . . . , n} and define q1j = \u03c7p (j) and q2j = 0\nfor j = 1, . . . , n. Consider the Hopf algebra structure on the symmetric\nalgebra S(Tn ) on rooted trees with n-coloured edges that corresponds to\nthis choice of qij .\nP P\n(i). The product Dt \u2022 Ds = w s\u2282w,sc =t q(s, w) Dw of Corollary 5.1\ndefines a pre-Lie algebra structure on the primitive elements P (Cn\u2217 )\nof S(Tn )\u2217 .\n(ii). If p = {1, . . . , n}, then there is a natural inclusion of this pre-Lie\nalgebra into the free pre-Lie algebra on n generators. The image in\nP\nthe free pre-Lie algebra is spanned by all sums i\u2208p ti , of trees with\nvertices coloured by p that only differ in that the colour of the root\nof ti is i.\nProof Consider the general formula for Dt \u2022Ds in Corollary 5.1. Note\nthat for qij \u2208 {0, 1} the coefficients q(s, w) are either 0 or 1. We can be\nmore precise. Let w and t be trees. A product of subtrees s = s1 *. . .*sm \u2282\nw is t-admissible if sc contains the root of w while s is grafted onto t = sc\n\n8\n\n\fby a edges of colours i1 , . . . , im \u2208 p to vertices v1 , . . . , vm respectively\neach of which is connected to the root by edges having colours in p. We\nonly use this terminology for n = 1, 2. Thus, in this case we consider\nq(s, w) = 0 unless the the corresponding subtree s is t-admissible.\nThe pre-Lie identity follows from\nX X\nDw ,\n(Dt \u2022 Ds ) \u2022 Du \u2212 Dt \u2022 (Ds \u2022 Du ) =\nw s*u\u2282w\n\nwhere the second sum is over t-admissible products s * u. This proves part\n(i) since the expression is symmetric in s and u.\nBefore we prove (ii) we study the pre-Lie algebra structure \u2022 is a bit\nmore detail. Let m(t, s, w) be the number of t-admissible subtrees s \u2282 w.\nThe operation \u2022 is then given by\nX\nm(t, s, w)Dw ,\nDt \u2022 Ds =\nw\n\nwhere the sum is over all rooted trees. For our aims it is better to use a\ndifferent description of this pre-Lie algebra. We closely follow the strategy\nof Hoffman [6] in this respect. If m(t, s, w) 6= 0, it is exactly the order of\nthe orbit of the root of the subtree s under the action of the group Aut(w)\nof automorphisms of w. If s and t are n-coloured trees and v is a vertex in\nt, denote by t \u25e6(v,i) s the tree obtained from t and s by connecting the root\nof s to the vertex v by an edge of colour i. Let n(t, s, w) be the number\nif vertices v \u2208 t such that t \u25e6(v,i) s = w for some i \u2208 p. Then for any\nsuch vertex v, the order of the orbit of v in t under the action of Aut(t)\nis exactly n(t, s, w).\nDefine an other pre-Lie algebra structure \u2022\u2032 on the same vector space\nP (Cn\u2217 ), by\nX\nDt \u2022\u2032 Ds =\nn(t, s, w) Dw ,\nw\n\nand denote this pre-Lie algebra by P (Cn\u2217 )\u2032 . For a subtree s \u2282 w, denote by Auts (w) the automorphisms of w that pointwise fix s. Then, if\nm(s, t, w) 6= 0 we can write, following Hoffman [6],\n|Aut(w)|\n|Auts (w)| * |Aut(t)|\n|Aut(s)|\nn(t, s, w) =\n,\n|Aut{v} (t)|\n\nm(t, s, w) =\n\nfor a vertex v such that t \u25e6(v,i) s = w for some i. Since |Auts (w)| =\n|Aut{v} (t)| it follows that Dt 7\u2212\u2192 |Aut(t)|Dt defines an isomorphism of\npre-Lie algebras P (Cn\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 P (Cn\u2217 )\u2032 (in characteristic 0).\nIn the remainder of the proof, let p = {1, 2, . . . , n}. We prove (ii) by\nconstructing an inclusion P (Cn\u2217 )\u2032 \u2212\u2192 Ln . Note that\nXX\nDt \u2022\u2032 Ds =\nDt\u25e6(v,i) s\nv\u2208t i\u2208p\n\nFor an n-coloured tree t, denote by \u2191i (t) the tree with coloured vertices\nobtined by moving the colour of ech edge up to the vertex directly above\n\n9\n\n\fit and colouring the root by i. Note that\n\u2191j (t \u25e6(v,i) s) = \u2191i (t) \u25e6v \u2191j (s).\nLet p = {1, . . . , n} and consider S(Tn ) with the corresponding Hopf algebra structure as defined above. Define \u03c6 : P (S(Tn )\u2217 )\u2032 \u2212\u2192 Ln from the\npre-Lie algebra of primitives to the free pre-Lie algebra on n generators\nby\nn\nX\n\u2191j (t).\n\u03c6(Dt ) =\nj=1\n\nThen \u03c6 is a linear enbedding. Moreover, \u03c6 preserves the pre-Lie algebra\nstructure since\nX\n\u03c6(Dt\u25e6(v,i) s )\n\u03c6(Dt \u2022\u2032 Ds ) =\n(v,i)\n\n=\n\nXX\n\n(v,i)\n\n=\n\nXX\nv\n\n\u2191(t \u25e6(v,i) s)\n\nj\n\n\u2191i (t) \u25e6v \u2191j (s)\n\ni,j\n\n= \u03c6(Dt ) \u2022 \u03c6(Ds ).\nQED\n\n5.3 Example In the case of the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra (Example 4.5), Theorem 5.2 states that the dual Hopf algebra is the universal\nenveloping algebra of the free pre-Lie algebra on one generator as first\nproved by Chapton-Livernet [2].\n\n6\n\nFormal coalgebra deformations\n\nIn this section we consider how the different Hopf algebra structures of\nTheorem 4.2 are related from the point of view of deformation theory. For\nsimplicity we restrict our attention to the case n = 1.\nLet A be a Hopf algebra. Recall (e.g. Gerstenhaber-Shack [5]) the\nbicomplex C p q (A) = Hom(A\u2297p , A\u2297q ) for p, q \u2265 1. For q fixed it is the\nHochschild complex of the algebra A with coefficients in A\u2297q , and for p\nfixed it is the Hochschild complex of the coalgebra A with coefficients in\nA\u2297p . Classes in H 3 (Tot(C \u2217\u2217 (A))) are in 1-1 correspondence with Hopf\nalgebra deformations of A modulo ~2 .\nA formal coalgebra deformation \u2206~ of a Hopf algebra A is a k[[~]]linear map \u2206~ : A[[~]] \u2212\u2192 A[[~]] \u2297k[[~]] A[[~] for which \u2206~ makes A[[~]]\nwith the same multiplication and counit a Hopf algebra over k[[~]], and\nsuch that evaluation at ~ = 0 gives the original Hopf algebra structure on\nA.\nThe vector spaces Der(A, A\u2297q ) of algebra derivations form the kernel\nof the horizontal differential at the edge of the complex C \u2217q (A), and thus a\n\n10\n\n\fsubcomplex of the coalgebra Hochschild complex. Coalgebra deformations\nmodulo ~2 of the Hopf P -algebra A are in 1-1 correspondence with classes\nin H 2 (Der(A, A\u2297\u2217 )).\nLet us now turn to the example of the Hopf algebra S(T1 ) with the\ncoproduct on trees given by \u2206(s) = s \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 s. This is the coproduct\ninduced by \u03c31 = \u03c32 = u \u25e6 ~.

Let us write Der0 (S(T1 ), S(T1 )\u2297\u2217 )\nfor the subcomplex of Der(S(T1 ), S(T1 )\u2297\u2217 ) consisting of those derivations\nthat preserve the degree. Classes in H 2 (Der0 (S(T1 ), S(T1 )\u2297\u2217 )) correspond\nto graded coalgebra deformations. The result below studies the deformations \u2206q1 ,q2 as graded coalgebra deformations.\n6.1 Proposition Consider S(T1 ) with the coproduct induced by \u03c31 =\n\u03c32 = u \u25e6 ~.\n(i).

Two coalgebra deformations \u2206q1 q2\nand \u2206q1\u2032 q2\u2032 are equivalent modulo ~2 iff we can find a derivation \u03c8 such\nthat the corresponding map \u03a8 satisfies for all s\n\u2206q1\u2032 q2\u2032 \u25e6 \u03a8(s) \u2261 \u03a8 \u2297 \u03a8 \u25e6 \u2206q1 ,q2 (s),\n\nor equivalently\n\n\u2206q1\u2032 q2\u2032 (s + \u03c8(s)~) \u2261 \u2206q1 ,q2 (s) + (\u03c8 \u2297 1)(\u2206q1 ,q2 (s))~ + (1 \u2297 \u03c8)(\u2206q1 ,q2 (s))~\n\n11\n\n\fmodulo ~2 . To compute this we only have to consider terms in \u2206q1\u2032 q2\u2032 (s)\nand \u2206q1 ,q2 (s) corresponding to u \u2282 s, such that\nX\nX\np(v, uc , s) \u2264 1,\np(v, u, s) +\nv\u2208u\n\nv\u2208uc\n\nwhich means that either u = s, or uc = s, or s = u\u25e6r \u03bb(1), or s = uc \u25e6r \u03bb(1).\nWe only need to consider terms in \u2206q1\u2032 q2\u2032 (\u03c8(x)) corresponding to u \u2282 s,\nsuch that\nX\nX\np(v, uc , s) = 0,\np(v, u, s) +\nv\u2208u\n\nv\u2208uc\n\nwhich means that either u = s, or uc = s.

Starting from an arbitrary Hopf operad P one can construct the\noperad P [\u03bbn ] which has as algebras P -algebras together with an n-ary\noperation. Under conditions similar to those in Theorem 4.2 one can find\na Hopf-P algebra structure on the initial P [\u03bbn ]-algebra (see [10], [11]).\nThe explicit calculations for P = Com\u2217 , the operad of unital commutative algebras is presented in the previous sections. These can also be\ndone for the operad Ass\u2217 of unital associative algebras. In this section we\nbriefly state some of the results.\n7.1 Definition Let the category An of unital associative algebras with\nan n-ary map be the category which has as as objects pairs (A, \u03b1) of an\nassociative unital algebra A and a linear map \u03b1 : A\u2297n \u2212\u2192 A, and which\nhas as maps An ((A, \u03b1), (B, \u03b2)) the algebra homomorphisms f : A \u2212\u2192 B\nsuch that \u03b2 \u25e6f \u2297n = f \u25e6\u03b1. Let (An , \u03bbn ) be the initial object in the category\nAn . Then An can be described as the free associative algebra on trees\nwith edges coloured by {1, . . . , n} and at each vertex the incoming edges\n\n12\n\n\fof each colour endowed with a separate linear ordering (planar n-trees, for\nshort).\n7.2 Theorem The tensor algebra An on planar rooted trees with n-coloured\nedges has a natural family of graded connected Hopf algebra structures,\nindexed by sequences (q11 , . . . , q1n , q21 , . . . , q2n ) \u2208 k2n . The inductive description of the coproduct is given by the formula of Theorem 4.2.\nThe An together again form a simplicial algebra (cf. Remark 2.4).\n7.3 Corollary Let An be the free associative algebra on the planar rooted\ntrees.\n(i). The coproducts on An of Corollary 4.2 are given by the closed formula\n!\nX Y Y pj (v,s,t) Y pj (v,sc ,t)\nc\nq2 j\ns\u2297s ,\nq1 j\n*\n\u2206(t) =\ns\u2282t\n\nj\n\nv\u2208sc\n\nv\u2208s\n\nwhere the product of trees is associative, non-commutative. The order of multiplication is given by the linear order on the roots of the\ntrees defined by the linear on the incoming edges at each vertex and\nthe partial order on vertices.\n(ii). The vector space of primitive elements of the dual is spanned by\nelements dual to planar n-trees. The Lie bracket is the commutator\nof the (non-associative) product \u2022 given by\n!\nX X Y Y p (v,s,w) Y p (v,t,w)\nj\nj\nq2 j\nDw ,\nDs \u2022 Dt =\nq1 j\n*\nw s\u2282w, sc =t j\n\nv\u2208s\n\nv\u2208t\n\nwhere w, s and t are trees with a linear ordering on the incoming\nedges of the same colour at each vertex and the inclusions of s and\nt in w have to respect these orderings.\nProof The only change is that we have to remember the ordering\nof up going edges at each vertex. Than one can copy the proof of the\ncommutative case verbatim.\nQED\n\n7.4 Remark Independently, Foissy [4] has found the formula for the Lie\nbracket in the case where n = 1, q11 = 1 and q12 = 0 (and Ass\u2217 is the\nunderlying operad). He uses this formula to give an explicit isomorphism\nbetween the Hopf algebras A1 and A\u22171 with this coproduct.\n\nReferences\n[1] C. Brouder and A. Frabetti.
