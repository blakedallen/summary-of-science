The MSSM not only addresses\nfundamental questions in particle physics, but also naturally provides a compelling dark\nmatter candidate, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In particular, the neutralino,\nwhich is a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the photon, the Z boson,\nand the neutral scalar Higgs particles, has the right cross section and mass to automatically\nprovide the observed density of cold dark matter in the universe. According to the analysis\nin [1], the latter has the value\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 = 0.1143 \u00b1 0.0034.\n\n(1)\n\nHere subscript \u03c7 refers to neutralinos, h is the Hubble constant H0 in units of 100 km/s/Mpc,\nand \u03a9\u03c7 = \u03c1\u03c7 /\u03c1c is the fraction of the neutralino density \u03c1\u03c7 in units of the critical density\n\u03c1c = 3H02 /(8\u03c0G) \u223c 10\u221229 h2 g/cm3 (alternatively, \u03a9\u03c7 h2 is the neutralino mass density in\nunits of 18.79 yg/m3 ).\nPerelstein and Spethmann [2] examined a particularly interesting region of MSSM parameter space which they dubbed the \"golden region.\" They argued that data and naturalness\n(i.e. a low degree of fine-tuning) point to a region within the Higgs and top sectors where\nthe experimental bounds from non-observation of superpartners and the Higgs boson are\nsatisfied and fine-tuning is close to the minimum possible value. They found that, in this\nregion, (i) the two stop eigenstates have masses below 1 TeV, (ii) there is a significant mass\nsplitting between the two stop mass eigenstates, typically \u03b4m \u2265 200GeV, and (iii) the stop\nmixing angle must be nonzero. They then suggested collider signatures of the golden region\nthat may be found at the LHC.\nIn this paper, we further examine this golden region, with a particular focus on discovering\nthe properties of the dark matter within it. We use the numerical package DarkSUSY [3]\nto find the same golden region as [2], and apply additional constraints due to experimental\nbounds on b \u2192 s\u03b3 as well. Then we look for the parameter regime inside the remaining\ngolden region that also gives the right relic density of neutralino dark matter.\nBelow we begin by reviewing the boundaries of the golden region, and then turn to the\nproperties of the dark matter within it.\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE MSSM GOLDEN REGION\n\nWe work in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). For\npractical reasons, and to match the choices in [2], we impose the following restrictions on the\nMSSM parameters: (1) we assume that all soft parameters are flavor-diagonal, (2) we assume\na common soft mass for the first and second generation squarks, mq\u0303 = mQ1,2 = mU 1,2 =\nmD1,2 , and for all sleptons, ml\u0303 = mL1,2,3 = mE 1,2,3 , (3) we set all tridiagonal terms A to zero\nexcept for At , (4) we further assume that the third generation soft mass mD3 = mq\u0303 , but\nlet mQ3 and mU 3 vary independently. We remain with 11 free parameters: the Higgs mass\nparameter \u03bc, the mass mA of the CP-odd Higgs boson, the ratio tan \u03b2 of the Higgs vacuum\nexpectation values, the gaugino mass parameters M1 , M2 , M3 , the soft parameters mq\u0303 and\nml\u0303 , and the third-generation soft parameters mQ3 , mU 3 and At . Furthermore, following [2],\nwe replace the last three parameters (mQ3 , mU 3 and At ) with the mass of the lightest stop\nm\u03031 , the mass difference between the stop masses \u03b4m = m\u03032 \u2212 m\u03031 , and the stop mixing angle\n\u03b8t . Finally, we use mt = 174.3 GeV for the top-quark mass, and define all parameters at the\nweak scale.\nWe scan the 11-dimensional parameter space by generating random values of the parameters. In most of our results, we use the parameters within the following ranges (all\ndimensionful parameters are in GeV):\n80 < \u03bc < 500,\n100 < M1 < 400,\n\n100 < mA < 2000,\n100 < M2 < 2000,\n\n100 < mq\u0303 < 2000,\n100 < m\u03031 < 1000,\n\ntan \u03b2 = 10,\n100 < M3 < 2000,\n\n100 < ml\u0303 < 2000,\n\n100 < \u03b4m < 600,\n\n\u03b8t = \u03c0/4.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nNotice that we fixed the value of \u03b8t and tan\u03b2 to reproduce one of the panels in Fig. 2 of\n[2]. We define our \"default scan\" to be the case where these values are fixed at tan\u03b2 = 10\nand \u03b8t = \u03c0/4. We also produced other special scans: we randomized tan \u03b2 in the range 0.5\nto 30; we implemented the GUT relation between M1 , M2 , and M3 ; we separately extended\nM1 up to 2000 GeV.\nThe points in Fig. 1 illustrate the golden region we obtain in our default scan. We have\nplotted the mass difference between the stop masses \u03b4m = m\u03032 \u2212 m\u03031 as a function of the\n3\n\n\fFIG. 1: The Improved Golden Region: Mass difference between the stop masses \u03b4m = m\u03032 \u2212 m\u03031\nas a function of the mass of the lightest stop m\u03031 . We have scanned SUSY parameter space\nwith constraints imposed from the bound on the Higgs mass, fine tuning, and other experimental\nconstraints including b \u2192 s\u03b3 to find an \"improved\" golden region; here we have fixed \u03b8t =\n\n\u03c0\n4\n\nand\n\ntan\u03b2 = 10 as our \"default scan\" in parameter space. For comparison, the area enclosed by the\nsolid line shows the corresponding golden region previously found in Fig. 2 of [2]. Note that our\nlowest value of \u03b4m = 150GeV is lower than that in the previous work as discussed in the text.\n\nmass of the lightest stop m\u03031 . This plot can be directly compared with Fig. 2 of [2], from\nwhich the solid triangular region is drawn. Using DarkSUSY, we have improved upon the\nprevious work by applying more accurate calculations of the Higgs boson mass and of the\nb \u2192 s\u03b3 branching ratio, as described below. A variety of other experimental constraints are\napplied as well, using their implementation in DarkSUSY. In particular, LEP2 searches for\ndirect production of charginos and stops constrain the chargino and stop masses, resulting\n> 80 GeV and m\u03031 > 90 GeV. The b \u2192 s\u03b3 decay rate [7] also constrains the golden\nin \u03bc \u223c\n\u223c\nregion. Whereas [2] noted that including this constraint was mostly beyond the scope of\ntheir paper, we have implemented this constraint throughout. Hence our results in Fig. 1\n\n4\n\n\fillustrate the \"improved\" golden region in the presence of this additional constraint (and of\na more accurate calculation of the Higgs boson masses).\nWe note that [2] defined a benchmark point in their Table 1, with particular choices of the\nother parameters, and did include b \u2192 s\u03b3 ratio when they checked this point using SuSpect.\nSuSpect gave them an acceptable b \u2192 s\u03b3 ratio for their benchmark model, but DarkSUSY\n(which includes better expressions for the branching ratio with NLO corrections) gives an\nunacceptable value.\nThe golden region in Fig. 1 contains 7000 points satisfying all relevant bounds. The\nregion is a triangle, with the lower boundary due to the constraint on the Higgs mass, the\nleftmost boundary due to the bounds on the \u03c1 parameter, and the upper boundary due to\nfine-tuning. We now discuss each of these bounds in turn.\n\nA.\n\nLower boundary of golden triangle: Higgs mass\n\nThe lower boundary of the golden region triangle is set by bounds on the Higgs mass.\nThe LEP2 lower bound on the standard model Higgs mass is [5]\nm(h0 ) \u2265 114GeV.\n\n(6)\n\nFor generic MSSM parameter choices, the limit on the lightest Higgs is very close to this value\nas well and we may use this bound. At tree level, the MSSM predicts m(h0 ) \u2264 mZ |cos2\u03b2|,\nso that large loop corrections are required to satisfy this bound. The dominant one-loop\ncorrections are from top and stop loops. The numerical package FeynHiggs [6] is incorporated\ninto DarkSUSY to properly compute the Higgs mass and to apply the experimental bound.\nWe note that the resulting boundary to the golden region that we find is slightly different\nfrom that of [2]: e.g. at m\u03031 = 440GeV, our lowest value of \u03b4m = 150GeV is quite a bit\nlower than their lowest value of \u03b4m \u223c 280. The reason for this discrepancy is that their\nanalytic approximations for the Higgs masses are less accurate than the values we find using\nthe numerical package.\n\n5\n\n\fB.\n\nUpper boundary of golden triangle: Fine-Tuning Constraint\n\nFine-tuning of the Z mass also constrains the Higgs sector. At tree level, the Z mass in\nthe MSSM is given by\nm2Z\n\n=\n\n\u2212m2u\n\n1\n1\u2212\ncos 2\u03b2\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\nm2d\n\n1\n1+\ncos 2\u03b2\n\n!\n\n\u2212 2|\u03bc|2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\nsin 2\u03b2 =\n\nm2u\n\n2b\n.\n+ m2d + 2|\u03bc|2\n\n(8)\n\nSince one of the two CP-even Higgs masses must satisfy m2u,d < 0 for electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, and since experimentally it is found that at least one of mu,d , |\u03bc| \u226b mZ , cancellation of the terms on the right hand side is required in order to get the right value of mZ .\nFollowing Barbieri and Giudice [4], one may quantify this fine-tuning by computing\n\u2202 log m2Z\n\u2202 log \u03be\n\nA(\u03be) =\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03be = m2u , m2d , b, \u03bc are the relevant Lagrangian parameters.

The overall fine-tuning \u2206 is defined by adding the\nfour A's in quadrature; values of \u2206 far above one indicate fine-tuning. Following [2], we\nrequire \u2206 \u2264 100, corresponding to fine tuning of 1% or better; this bound is implemented\n< 440 GeV for tan\u03b2 \u2265 0.5. This matches the\nin our work and produces an upper bound \u03bc \u223c\nupper bound on \u03bc found in [2]. We impose the constraints on the chargino mass from LEP2\n> 80 GeV.\nchargino searches, which select \u03bc \u223c\nThe upper boundary of the golden region triangle is determined by further restrictions on\nthe fine-tuning. Quantum corrections to naturalness also constrain the size of the quantum\ncorrections to the parameters in Eq. (7). Following [2], here we consider the largest correction\n6\n\n\fin the MSSM, namely the one-loop contribution to the m2u parameter from top and stop\nloops:\n\u03b4m2u\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3\n(m\u030322 \u2212 m\u030321 )2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2248\ny\nm\u0303\n+\nm\u0303\n\u2212\n2m\n+\nsin2 2\u03b8t\nt\n1\n2\nt\n2\n2\n16\u03c0\n4v\n\n!\n\nlog\n\n2\u039b2\n.\nm\u030321 + m\u030322\n\n(11)\n\nHere mt is the top mass, \u039b is the scale at which the logarithmic divergence is cut off, and\nfinite (matching) corrections have been ignored.

This\nconstraint is outlined by the upper edge in Fig. 1, which corresponds to \u2206t \u2264 33.3 (3% fine\ntuning). Note that the particular value of \u2206t depends on the scale \u039b; we choose \u039b = 100\nTeV in this figure. As pointed out in [2], the shape of the \u2206t contours and the obvious trend\nfor fine tuning to increase with the two stop masses is independent of \u039b.\n\nC.\n\nLeft Boundary of Golden Triangle: \u03c1 parameter\n\nThe left boundary of the golden region triangle is set by measurements of the \u03c1 parameter,\nwhich obtains corrections from stop and sbottom loops. We compute the \u03c1 parameter using\nDarkSUSY and require\n(2 \u2212 8) \u00d7 10\u22124 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2212 1 \u2264 (2 + 8) \u00d7 10\u22124,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich represents the 2\u03c3 range from [8].\n\nIII.\n\nDARK MATTER\n\nNow that we have found the improved golden region with the b \u2192 s\u03b3 bound implemented,\nwe can investigate the properties of the dark matter in this region. Using DarkSUSY, we\n\n7\n\n\ffind the neutralino relic density for each set of MSSM parameter values in the improved\ngolden region.\nFig. 2 shows the relic density as a function of neutralino mass for all our default points in\nthe golden region. As discussed previously, our default scan is defined by fixing tan\u03b2 = 10\nand \u03b8t = \u03c0/4 and scanning over other parameters. The lines illustrate the band that\nsatisfies the cosmological requirement of \u03a9\u03c7 h2 in Eq.(1). Notice that there are points with\nthe correct density for practically all neutralino masses in the golden region (with perhaps a\ntiny exception at the largest masses). Although most of the points in the figure have small\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 , we remind the reader that the density of points, in this and all the other plots is\narbitrary. The simulation uses a random number generator in the parameter domain. The\ndots are used for a plot as long as they satisfy the criteria for the golden region. Thus,\nthe dot density doesn't necessarily have a physical meaning. It simply represents how the\nrandom number generator creates the dots.\nIn our default scan, we allowed the gaugino mass parameters M1,2,3 to vary independently.\nIf we instead impose the GUT relations\n5\ntan2 \u03b8W M2 ,\n3\n\u03b1s (mZ ) 2\nM3 =\nsin \u03b8W M2 ,\n\u03b1\n\nM1 =\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwe still find points satisfying the cosmological constraint on \u03a9\u03c7 h2 . This is shown in Fig. 3,\nobtained by using the parameter ranges in Eqs. 2-5 but with the additional GUT conditions\non M1 , M2 , and M3 imposed.\nTo understand the properties of the points with the cosmologically interesting values of\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2 , we have analyzed the dependence of \u03a9\u03c7 h2 in our default sample on all of the 11\nindependent parameters in the Lagrangian. Most of the parameters showed no interesting\nconnection with \u03a9\u03c7 h2 , except for M1 , and the gaugino fraction Zg .\nFig. 4 shows the relic density as a function of Zg /(1 \u2212 Zg ) where Zg is the gaugino\nfraction of the neutralino. The denominator 1 \u2212 Zg is the higgsino fraction. Points in the\ncosmologically interesting band typically have Zg /(1 \u2212 Zg ) > 1. Thus, the dark matter in\nthe golden region that satisfies Eq.(1) is predominantly gaugino rather than higgsino.\nFigs. 5(a) and (b) plot the relic density as a function of M1 , the mass of the U(1)Y\ngaugino. Fig. 5(a) is for our default scan, while Fig. 5(b) is for an extended scan of 1,700\npoints in which tan\u03b2 varies in the range 0.5 to 30 and M1 is allowed to be as large as 2000\n8\n\n\fFIG. 2: Neutralino relic density \u03a9\u03c7 h2 as a function of neutralino mass m\u03c7 for our default scan in\nparameter space (tan\u03b2 = 10, \u03b8t = \u03c0/4). Each dot represents a point in supersymmetric parameter\nspace that lies within the golden region. The horizontal band shows the 2\u03c3 range in the measured\nvalue of the cosmological density of cold dark matter [1].

One can see that points with the right relic density to explain WMAP have M1 < 300\nGeV.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion we have imposed further experimental bounds (b \u2192 s\u03b3) on the golden\nregion found by [2] and have searched for subsets of this region which provide today's dark\nmatter density in the form of neutralinos. We found that M1 < 300GeV is required, and\nthat the neutralino that is the dark matter is predominantly gaugino. In the future, we\nplan to examine direct and indirect detection rates in concert with LHC tests of the golden\nregion.\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 3: Same as Fig. 2 except that M1 , M2 , and M3 are related through the GUT relations,\nEqs. 15-16.
