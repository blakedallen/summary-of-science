INTRODUCTION\n\nSupernova 1987A, the first naked-eye supernova (SN) in\nfour centuries, was first discovered on 1987 Feb. 24.23 at\nthe Las Campanas Observatory (Shelton 1987), and was\nlater identified with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) progenitor, Sk \u221269\u25e6 202 (Sanduleak 1969), a B3 I supergiant\n(Rousseau et al. 1978). From its spectral type and distance,\nwe infer a luminosity of (3 \u2212 6) \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 , a surface temperature 15000\u201318000 K, and a radius (2 \u2212 4) \u00d7 1012 cm,\nwhich imply that the star exploded as a blue supergiant (or\nBSG; Woosley et al. 1987). Spectra taken shortly after the\nexplosion was discovered revealed Balmer lines, indicating\na Type II SN, but expanding at nearly 0.1c. A number of\nanomalies, such as this high expansion velocity, a weak initial outburst, a very hot UV spectrum at early times, and subsequent rapid color evolution, indicated a compact progenitor\nenvelope, typical of a BSG, rather than the expected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Heavy mass loss could have driven\nSk \u221269\u25e6 202 to the BSG stage (mass loss being reasonable\ngiven the large number of Wolf-Rayet stars in the LMC), although evidence for a substantial envelope (the long slow rise\nof the optical light source, the late appearance of near-IR H\n1 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive, Baltimore,\nMD 21218; sugerman@stsci.edu\n2 Department of Astronomy, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;\narlin@astro.columbia.edu\n3 Guest Observer, Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory\n4 Las Campanas Observatory, Carnegie Observatories, Casilla 601, La Serena, Chile; kunkel@ociw.edu\n5 Southern Observatory for Astronomical Research, Casilla 603, La Serena, Chile; sheathcote@noao.edu\n6 Department of Physics, Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY 11549;\nStephen.Lawrence@hofstra.edu\n\nlines and a lack of early escape X and \u03b3-rays) also exists. For\na complete accounting, see the review by Arnett et al. (1989).\nPanagia et al. (1987) reported narrow UV emission lines\nin International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra taken on day\n80, which they interpreted as arising from pre-existing CS\nmaterial. An analysis of these spectra by Fransson et al.\n(1989) revealed a large overabundance of nitrogen, suggesting both significant CNO processing by the progenitor, and\nthat a reasonable fraction of the progenitor's hydrogen envelope had to have been ejected to reveal such material. This\nargues that the star first evolved into a RSG before returning to the blue in a so-called \"blue loop\" (Hofmeister et al.\n1964). Both RSG (Humphreys & Davidson 1978) and BSG\n(Humphreys & McElroy 1984) stars are known within the\nLMC, thus this evolutionary sequence is consistent with\nknown populations.\nThe first resolved images of this CS material were taken\non days 750 (Crotts, Kunkel & McCarthy 1989) and 1027\n(Wampler et al. 1990a), showing a central, elliptical structure, surrounded by two outer loops (Crotts et al. 1989;\nWampler et al. 1990b). The geometry of this material was\nthe subject of some debate, remaining poorly understood until Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (Burrows et al.\n1995, and references therein) clearly revealed a dense circumstellar equatorial ring (ER) flanked by two larger outer\nrings (ORs), as shown in Figure 1. To explain how a\nmass-losing supergiant produced this nebula, most authors\ninvoke the interacting stellar winds scenario (Kwok 1982;\nBalick, Preston & Icke 1987), in which colliding winds from\nthe BSG and RSG mass-loss stages conspire to create three\nring-like overdensities within the CS environment (CSE).\nThese were ionized by the SN light pulse and are observed\n\n\f2\n\nSugerman et al.\nEcho 2\n\nlipsoid\n\no El\n\nEch\n\n\u03c1\n\nD\n\nEcho 2\n\u03b8\n\nr\n\nSource\n\n\u03c1\n\nz\n\nEarth\n\nEcho 1\n\nView from space\n\nEcho 1\nImage on the sky\n\nF IG . 2.- Cartoon schematic of a scattered-light echo.

North is up, east is left. The ER\n(central ring) surrounds the ejecta from the SN (center), and is flanked by the\nnorth and south ORs (NOR and SOR, respectively). The companion stars 2\nand 3 (Walker & Suntzeff 1990) are positionally coincident along the line of\nsight. To increase the display range, the ER has a separate color stretch.\n\ntoday through recombination cooling.\nSince the SN lightcurve was strongly peaked for a finite duration, and the progenitor is surrounded by a structured CSE, we expect that the light pulse will scatter off of\nsurrounding reflective material (e.g., dust), producing \"light\nechoes\" that are observable long after the SN has faded\n(Couderc 1939). Bond et al. (1989), Couch & Malin (1989),\nand Crotts & Kunkel (1989) discovered a light echo at \u223c 9\u2032\u2032\nwhose position agrees well with the predicted location of a\ncontact discontinuity (CD) between the RSG outflows and\nthe interstellar bubble formed by the early-type blue MS\nprogenitor's winds (Chevalier & Emmering 1989). Crotts et\nal. (e.g., Crotts & Kunkel 1991; Crotts, Kunkel & Heathcote\n1995, hereafter CKH95) have continued to search for light\nechoes in a regular campaign using emission-suppressed continuum imaging. They have found echoes indicative of the\nstructure of the three-ring nebulosity, forming an equatorial\nwaist and sides of an hourglass, yet ending abruptly near the\nORs with no capping surface. Outside this inner nebula, they\nfound four additional features: (1) a reconfirmation of the\nCD light echo of Bond et al. (1989) at 9 \u2212 15\u2032\u2032 ; (2) a sheet\nalong the equatorial plane of the ER, bisecting the nebula;\n(3) diffuse flux from the hourglass nebula to the CD; and\n(4) a discontinuity in this nebula, called \"Napolean's Hat\"\n(Wampler et al. 1990a).\nObservation and modeling of this circumstellar environment provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the massloss history of the progenitor. The SN 1987A nebula is one example of a much larger class of bipolar outflows, which occur\nin nearly all evolved stars (e.g., luminous blue variables, B[e]\nstars, AGB mass loss, bipolar and asymmetric planetary nebulae). This \"stellar paleontology\" is of immense importance\nfor understanding bipolar-outflow and bipolar-nebula formation mechanisms, not just of this object or in intermediate-tohigh mass stars, but in stars of all masses.\nWe summarize in this paper an observational effort, at the\nhighest sensitivity and resolution to date, to understand more\nfully the entire circumstellar environment of SN 1987A, and\nto recreate a more complete history of the progenitor's massloss, as revealed by light echoes in 16 years of optical imaging. After introducing echoes in \u00a72, we summarize the data\n\nand reduction in \u00a73. These data are used to build a complete\nmodel of all material within \u223c30 ly of the SN, the 3-D analyses of which are summarized in \u00a74, followed by the dust\nproperties in \u00a75. Full details of these sections are presented in\nSugerman et al. (2005, hereafter Paper II ).\nWith a much greater volume of the progenitor's CSE revealed, we find that no extant model adequately explains\nhow that environment was formed. In \u00a76, we review and\ncritique formation scenarios for this system, including the\nprogenitor's MS wind, interacting supergiant winds, windcompressed disks, and the influence of a binary companion.\nWe use the light-echo data to constrain the parameter space of\nthese models, and we qualitatively sketch a hybrid formation\nsequence for the entire CSE in \u00a77. It is our hope that the results presented here will serve as a significantly-improved set\nof constraints for hydrodynamic models of the CSE formation, for stellar-evolution models of the progenitor, and for\naddressing the general question of asymmetric and bipolar\nstellar outflows.\n2. LIGHT ECHOES\n\nWhen a light pulse is scattered by dust into the line of sight,\nan observable echo is produced, provided the pulse is sufficiently luminous and the dust sufficiently dense. An echo\nobserved a given time after the pulse must lie on the locus\nof points equidistant in total light travel from the source and\nobserver, that is, an ellipsoid with known foci. This simple\ngeometry, shown in Figure 2, directly yields the line-of-sight\ndepth z (and hence the three-dimensional, or 3-D, position)\nof an echo, uncertain only by the assumed distance D to the\nsource. For D \u226b r, one finds (Couderc 1939)\n\u03c12 ct\n\u2212\n(1)\n2ct 2\nwhere \u03c1 = r sin \u03b8 is the distance of the echo from the source in\nthe plane of the sky, \u03b8 is the scattering angle, and t is the delay\nbetween observing the echo and unscattered light pulse.\nA complete discussion of light echoes, including singlescattering models and the observability of echoes around a\nwide variety of cataclysmic and other variable stars, can be\nfound in Sugerman (2003). The relevant light echo model,\ndust and outburst properties for SN 1987A are summarized\nin \u00a7?? of Paper II. In general, echo brightness scales directly\nwith dust density, inversely with distance, and decreases nonlinearly with increasing scattering angle.\nz=\n\n3. DATA AND REDUCTION\n\n3.1. Observations\nSN 1987A has been observed many times per year since\nday 375 (after core collapse) in a ground-based campaign\nto monitor the appearance and evolution of its light pulse\n\n\fA New View of SN 1987A\nas it illuminates circumstellar and interstellar material. To\nminimize confusion from sources of nebular-line emission,\nfour specially-selected continuum bands were used for the\nmonitoring campaign, centered at 4700, 6120, 6880, and\n8090\u00c5. Some data from this campaign have previously been\nreported by Crotts et al. (1989); Crotts & Heathcote (1991);\nCrotts & Kunkel (1991); and CKH95 in studying the circumstellar environment, and in Xu, Crotts & Kunkel (1994, 1995)\nand Xu & Crotts (1999) for interstellar echoes. Seventeen\nepochs of imaging with high signal-to-noise, good seeing\n(arcsec or better), and sufficient resolution to resolve most\ncrowded stars exist between 1998 Dec and 1996 Jan. These\ndata are supplemented with archival HST Wide Field and\nPlanetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) imaging taken between 1994\nand 2001. Full details of the observations are given in \u00a7?? of\nPaper II.\n3.2. Data Reduction\nThe complete data-reduction is presented in \u00a7?? of Paper II. To search for light echo signal, we employ a customized implementation of the PSF-matched difference imaging (Tomaney & Crotts 1996) IRAF package difimphot, fully\ndescribed in \u00a7?? and Appendix A of Paper II. A subset of the\nPSF-matched difference images are shown in Figure 3; see\n\u00a7?? of Paper II for additional data and discussion. The innermost echoes were particularly bright up to day 1469, and\nare washed out at the brightness-stretch needed to display the\nouter echoes. In such cases, a 12\u2032\u2032 inset centered on the SN\nis shown at the top right of each panel, scaled in brightness to\nbetter-resolve the innermost echo signal.\n3.3. Echo Measurement and Visualization\nEchoes were detected and measured in difference images\nby fitting a series of convolved moffats to radial surfacebrightness profiles of arclength 10\u25e6 centered on the SN. See\n\u00a7?? of Paper II for complete details. The centers of all moffats\nhave been marked in the difference images (Fig. 3), and color\ncoded to compare echoes believed to be physically associated.\nDuring their detection, echoes were categorized as belonging to one of the three expected structures: (1) a circumstellar\nhourglass-shaped nebula reported in CKH95, (2) Napoleon's\nHat (Wampler et al. 1990a), or (3) the discontinuity between\nthe progenitor's RSG and MS winds (Chevalier & Emmering\n1989). In Figure 3, these have been color coded red, green,\nand blue, respectively. However we also found additional\nechoes between the hourglass and Napoleon's Hat, arbitrarily\ncolored cyan for those looping to the north of the SN, or gold\nto the south. In later epochs, many of these southern echoes\nhave positions that are more consistent with a counterpart to\nNapoleon's Hat, and have been marked purple.\nThat diffuse structure exists between the inner hourglass and Napoleon's Hat has been previously reported by\nCrotts & Kunkel (1991) and CKH95. These are consistent\nwith the cyan and yellow echoes identified in the same region of the current data, which now map out a much more extensive volume of the innermost CSE. Contact-discontinuity\nechoes have been previously reported in observations only up\nto day 1028, while we are able to trace this structure through\nday 3270. Napoleon's Hat was imaged as early as day 850 and\nup to day 1650 by Wang & Wampler (1992), while we detect\nits signal from day 659 to 2095. We believe this is the first\ndiscussion of the southern-counterpart (purple) to Napoleon's\nHat, which was illuminated between days 1787\u20133270.\n\n3\n\n3.4. Echo Visualization\nTo study echo positions in 3-D, we have custom-written\ngraphics software to perform simple renderings, in which the\npositions of the echoes are transformed to allow viewing from\nany angle. The method is fully explained in \u00a7?? of Paper II,\nand briefly annotated in the caption of Figure 4, which shows\nan illustrative example.\nThe region of space probed by a light echo is an unusual geometric function, and we are generally unfamiliar with viewing structures by their intersection with parabloids. To facilitate the understanding of this mapping, we have rendered\nechoes from a bipolar nebula in Figure 4. These are intended\nto guide the reader in visualizing such intersections, and in\ntranslating from 2-D data on the sky (left column) to 3-D positions in real space (right columns). This also shows that the\ngeometry of a structure can only be deduced from multiple\nechoes. See \u00a7?? of Paper II for more detailed discussion, and\na map of the parabolae corresponding to all epochs of data.\nEcho positions in 3-D are computed from their epoch and\n2-D image positions using equation (1), assuming the echo\ncenter is produced by the light pulse maximum at day 87.\nWe adopt a distance to the SN of 50 kpc, a common average\nbetween many of the derived LMC distances (Gould & Uza\n1998; Feast 1999; Romaniello et al. 2000).\nThe 3-D positions of all echoes are rendered in Figure 5.\nThe top, middle, and bottom rows show the contact discontinuity (CD), Napoleon's Hat (NH), and the inner circumstellar\n(CS) material, respectively. Colors correspond to those indicated in Figure 3, except for the yellow points in the CD,\nwhich were identified in WFPC2 images very close to a bright\nstar cluster northwest of the SN (P.A. 300\u25e6 , \u03c1 = 15\u2032\u2032 ). We distinguish these data because large residuals from the closelyspaced, bright stars made it impossible to verify the echoes in\nground-based images.\n4. A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE CIRCUMSTELLAR\nENVIRONMENT\n\nA rigorous analysis of the 3-D structure of the light echo\ndata is presented in Paper II, \u00a7??\u2013??, however we describe the\nresults in the following subsections. We begin with the reasonable assumption that the echoes lie on continuous surfaces,\nonly subsets of which have been illuminated. Echo brightness\ndecreases with increasing scattering angle and distance from\nthe illuminating source, and increases with dust number and\ncolumn density. That echoes were not observed in some regions between the parabolae in Figure 5 need not imply lack\nof scattering dust, but may result from unfavorable geometry,\nor limitations in the data quality.\n4.1. Contact Discontinuity Echoes\nWhen examined in spherical-polar coordinates, the CD\nechoes (Fig. 5a\u2013c) appear to trace two different geometric\nshapes. Points east and west of the SN form a shell-like feature at roughly constant radius, while points south of the SN\n(P.A. 150\u25e6\u2013210\u25e6 ) form a radial feature at roughly constant inclination. In both cases, the points appear to lie on a surface\nwith some degree of symmetry, such as a spheroidal or conical structure. Since only a partial cross section of the CD nebula has been illuminated, finding its inclination through numeric minimization of a merit function (e.g. the best-fit cone\nor line; see Appendix B of Paper II) was not highly successful.\nWe supplemented those results by testing how the echo points\ncompared to geometric figures observed at different orienta-\n\n\f4\n\nSugerman et al.\n\nF IG . 3.- Selected 50\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 50\u2032\u2032 difference images.

Five echo\nparabolae are drawn, each occuring at the time (in years) indicated next to\neach curve. Below, renderings show the light echoes for the first two parabolae (first row), third parabola (second row), last two parabolae (third row),\nand all parabolae (last row). Axes are defined as z toward the observer and\nx \u2212 y in the plane of the sky, with x increasing west and y north. Axis labels indicate the positive direction. The origin is set at the SN, and is always\nmarked by a black dot. Major ticks mark 2 ly, and the origin is indicated by\nthe longest tick along each axis. The coordinates and axes have been given a\nslight perspective transformation (Appendix C of Paper II). Points are shaded\nusing simple ray tracing, and larger points are closer to the observer. Left\nColumn: Face-on view (the plane of the sky). Middle Column: Oblique view\nrotated 45\u25e6 . Right Column: Side view from far to the east. Note that the\ngeometry of the nebula, as revealed in light echoes, is only clear when many\nechoes well-separated in time are considered at once.\n\ntions, and conclude that the CD echoes lie roughly on a surface of rotation about a single axis inclined 40\u25e6 south and 8\u25e6\neast of the line of sight. This axis may also be offset east of\nthe SN by . 1 ly. The cross section gives some indication of\nan ellipticity of b/a = 0.95, with the major axis aligned toward\nnorth, however this is not a robust measurement.\nThe data are transformed into a \"primed\" cylindrical co-\n\n5\n\nordinate system about this axis, designated by z\u2032 along the\naxis and \u03c0 \u2032 the radius. Figure 6 shows the resulting radial\nprofile \u03c0 \u2032 (z\u2032 ). Assuming these data trace a structure that (1)\nhas rotational symmetry about z\u2032 , and (2) is symmetric about\nthe equator (z\u2032 = 0), an average radial profile of h\u03c0 \u2032 i versus z\u2032\ncan be constructed by binning the points along the axis. This\n(and standard deviations in each bin) is shown over the individual data. Some circles located at \u03c0 \u2032 \u223c 15 and z=4\u20138 ly\nappear disconnected from the rest of the shell-like material.\nThese points, which we call the \"spurs,\" were treated separately when making the average radial profile.\nThe probable CD structure is visualized by revolving this\nfunction about the symmetry axis, reflecting it about the equator, and reinclining it to the favored orientation, as shown\nin Figure 12a\u2013b. Colors are the same as Figure 5, only the\nsouthern echoes have been colored red and green to distinguish points marked with \"\u00d7\" and \"+\" in Fig. 6. Figure 12c\u2013d\nshows the complete structure in monotone grey, overlaid with\nthe actual echo points from Figure 5, to show exactly which\nparts of the complete structure were sampled.\nThe complete structure is fairly complicated, and can not be\ndescribed by a single geometric function. Figure 11a shows\na scaled cartoon of the salient features. A \"shell\" lies along\na prolate spheroid with a polar axis of 20 ly and equatorial\naxes of 11 ly. However, the ends of this spheroid have been\ndrawn out into tapering, \"radial\" cones with opening angles of\nabout 35\u25e6 , extending from 16 to 28 ly from the SN. Embedded\nwithin this prolate structure are narrower, tapering cones (the\n\"jet\") extending from 10\u201326 ly from the SN, with an opening angle of about 20\u25e6 , and a maximum radius of 3 ly. The\n\"spurs\" lie along a cylindrical annulus that smoothly encircles\nthe CD.\nIt is unclear whether the prolate shell is continuous in z\u2032\nalong its equator (dashed equatorial lines in Fig. 11a), since\nno echoes were observed from that region. Whether this is\ndue to shadowing from material closer to the SN is addressed\nin \u00a7?? of Paper II. The northwestern-WFPC2 echoes are positioned at z\u2032 \u223c 4 ly along the axis, and at roughly 8 ly in radius.\nThis could suggest the prolate shell is pinched at its waist to a\nsmaller radius of 8 ly. However given the very limited spatial\nsampling of these inner echoes, there is little evidence that\nthey lie on a uniform structure. Similarly, very little signal\nwas detected from the spurs which may suggest that they are\nisolated clumps, rather than a uniform feature.\n4.2. Napoleon's Hat\nFigures 5d\u2013f show the 3-D positions of the NH echoes.\nThe northern (green) points forming the familiar bow-shape\nfor which this structure was named (Wampler et al. 1990a)\nappear to lie on a thin, cylindrical shell that is completed\nby the newly-discovered southern points. To avoid confusion between this and previous work, we will keep the name\n\"Napoleon's Hat,\" by which we refer to the entire ensemble\nof echoes. Despite the temptation to call the southern points\n\"Napoleon's Collar,\" we will simply refer to these as NHnorth and NH-south, when needed.\nTwo nearly-horizontal features protrude from this shell toward the observer, appearing horn-like when viewed from\nabove (panel f). In the following discussion, we refer to these\nas the \"horns,\" to distinguish them from the rest of the NH material. These are the echoes seen in early imaging that bridged\nbetween NH-north and the larger-radii CD echoes (Fig. 3).\nViewed in spherical-polar coordinates, the NH echoes are\nconsistent with a cylinder or hourglass. We measured the\n\n\f6\n\nSugerman et al.\n\nF IG . 5.- Rendered views of all light echoes identified in Fig. 3. Points have been rendered using the method described in \u00a73.4; also see Fig. 4. The left column\nshows observed views in the plane of the sky, the middle column shows views from the side (far to the east) and the right column shows views from the top (far to\nthe north). Parabolae from the earliest and latest epochs at which echoes were observed are indicated in the side and top views. Point colors correspond to those\nin Fig. 3 except for the yellow points in the top row, which denote echoes found in WFPC2 images which could not be resolved from the residuals of nearby\nbright stars in ground-based images.

Bottom row: Inner circumstellar hourglass echoes.\n\nshape and inclination of such structures by fitting a biconical\nfrustum to all points, as explained in Appendix B.4 of Paper\nII. The best fit is an hourglass with elliptical cross section,\noriented 40\u25e6 south and 7\u25e6 east of the line of sight. The semimajor and minor axes are 4.6 and 3.8 ly, with opening angles\nat the axes of 28 and 40\u25e6 , respectively, and the major axis is\nrotated 92 \u2212 101\u25e6 east of north. That the cross-section is elliptical is unexpected, and we reverified this by directly examining the data looking down the axis of inclination. The best-fit\nellipse (Appendix B.2 of Paper II) to the resulting distribution\nhas negligible offset from the origin, and b/a = 0.82 \u00b1 0.02\nwith the major axis rotated 103\u25e6 \u00b1 3 east of north.\nRemoving this ellipticity from the radial values of \u03c0 \u2032 as a\nfunction of z\u2032 yields the distribution shown in Figure 7. Also\n\nshown is the average radial profile of the NH echoes, generated by binning the points along the inclination axis and computing the average radius about that value. As with the CD,\nwe visualize the probable structure containing these echoes by\nreflecting this average radial profile about the equator and revolving it around the axis. The result is an inclined hourglass,\nas rendered in Figure 12e\u2013h.\nAn examination of Figure 12h shows that very little of the\nhourglass was actually probed by the horns. We show in \u00a7??\nof Paper II that such limited illumination was a natural result\nof the scattering geometry of this complete structure. The\nhourglass therefore flares to a radius (or semi-minor axis if\nthe cross section remains elliptical) of \u223c 7 ly about 7 ly from\nthe SN along the axis of symmetry.\n\n\fA New View of SN 1987A\n\nF IG . 6.- CD echoes, transformed into cylindrical coordinates with z\u2032 along\nthe axis of symmetry (40\u25e6 south, 8\u25e6 east) and \u03c0 \u2032 measured radially from it.\nEastern and western points are marked by filled and open circles, respectively.\nSouthern points are marked as \"\u00d7\" except for a subset at smaller \u03c0 \u2032 marked\nwith \"+\".

Inner hourglass points (red in\nFig. 5g\u2013i) are marked with \"\u00d7\", extended-flux points (cyan and gold in Fig.\n5g\u2013i) with circles, and extended flux points belonging to the hourglass with\nsquares. The average radial profiles to each structure are overplotted. Note\nthat there are many binned averages in this plot, which are discussed in the\ntext.\nF IG . 7.- As Fig. 6, but for NH data, with the ellipticity removed. Overplotted is the average radial profile, measured in bins along |z\u2032 |. Single points\nhave fixed errors.\n\nThe complete cross section is shown in the cartoon sketch\nin Figure 11b. Of note are the radial features in, and about 1.5\nly above/below, the equatorial plane. CKH95 reported a small\nset of echoes within 3 ly of the SN that are coincident with the\nER plane, which they interpreted as evidence for an extended\ncircumstellar equatorial disk. These NH equatorial echoes appear to extend this disk to a radius of 5 ly, with a thickness of\n& 0.75 ly. We note that this structure is inconsistent with NH\nbeing a parabolic bow-shock north of the SN, as proposed by\nWang & Wampler (1992) and Wang, Dyson, & Kahn (1993).\nThis is discussed in greater detail in \u00a7?? of Paper II.\n4.3. Inner Circumstellar Material\nThe inner 3\u2032\u2032 surrounding SN 1987A have been previously\nstudied by CKH95 using a subset of the data presented here,\nin which the authors reported a double-lobed CS hourglass\nwith a distinct cylindrical symmetry axis. Although the red\necho points in Figure 5g\u2013i appear to lie along such a surface,\nwe cannot immediately explore this feature in our data since it\nis unclear which extended-flux echoes (cyan and gold points)\nare associated with an hourglass. We use the work of CKH95\nas a springboard to help disentangle our data.\nFitting a biconical hourglass to the CKH95 data, we find the\nstructure is inclined 45\u25e6 south and 8\u25e6 east of the line of sight.\nThis compares favorably to the orientation they reported us-\n\ning a minimization-of-scatter estimator. Adopting this as a\npreliminary orientation, we transformed our CS echo points\ninto cylindrical coordinates about this axis, which revealed an\nadditional subset consistent with those initially identified as\npart of the hourglass. The full set of probable hourglass points\nis rendered in Figure 8. As can be seen in panel (b), only a\nsmall arc along the southernmost limb of of the southern lobe\nwas probed by the earliest observed echoes.\nA combination of fitting biconical hourglasses to these data,\nand ensuring that the inner waist of this hourglass reproduces\nthe observed shape of the ER, yields the 3-D geometry of both\nstructures. We find the hourglass is inclined 41\u25e6 south and 8\u25e6\neast of the line of sight, with its axis shifted 0.1 ly west of\nthe SN. The waist has a semi-major axis of 1.04 ly rotated\n9\u25e6 north of east, with b/a = 0.94, and the frusta have halfopening angles of 12. Note that this is consistent with the\nfindings by Sugerman et al. (2002) that the nebula is offset\nslightly west of the SN.\nDeprojected by the above inclination, the ER is best-fit\nby an ellipse with major axis 0.\u2032\u2032 82 rotated 9\u25e6 north of east,\nb/a = 0.98, and the centroid is shifted 19 mas west of the SN.\nThis is the first direct measurement of the ER's orientation\nand deprojected geometry. Full details of these analyses are\npresented in \u00a7?? of Paper II.\nAs in the previous two subsections, we incline the data\nabout this axis, remove any ellipticity, and plot the cylindricalradial profile in Figure 9. Extended flux points that are now\nassociated with the hourglass are plotted as squares. A large\n\n\f8\n\nSugerman et al.\n\nsubset of the extended-flux echoes (circles) are concentrated\nwithin 1 ly of the equatorial plane (z\u2032 = 0), between 1.5\u20134 ly\nfrom the SN, and appear to form a thick equatorial waist or\nbelt circumscribing the hourglass. As in the previous two sections, we measure the average radial profile of these points in\nbins along |z\u2032 |. There is much structure to these data, which\nrequired the fitting of six profiles. We again visualize the nebula by reflecting each profile about the equator, and revolving\nit around the cylindrical axis, as rendered in Figure 12i\u2013p, and\nsketched in cross section in Figure 11c. We identify five features in this data, discussed below.\nThe innermost radial structure is the hourglass, colored red\nin Figure 12i\u2013p. This is fairly cylindrical (opening angle\n\u223c12\u25e6 ), with a semi-minor axis of 1.2 ly, tapering close to the\nequator and opening just slightly at large z\u2032 . A very small\nnumber of points suggest that it also tapers around z\u2032 = 1.5 \u2212 2\nly and flares at z\u2032 = 0.9 and 1.4 ly, but these features are\nmarginal. Consistent with CKH95, we do not see evidence\nfor a \"capping surface\" to this structure, as would be expected\nfrom a peanut-like nebula. To distinguish this hourglass from\nthe larger one containing the NH echoes, we refer to each by\ntheir association, i.e., the former is the \"CS hourglass.\"\nIn Figure 9, many of the extended-flux points (squares) lie\njust outside the average position of the hourglass. Since most\nof these points are part of the southern lobe, this could suggest it is wider than its northern counterpart. A more likely\ninterpretation is that many of the southern-lobe points represent dust just outside the densest part of the hourglass, which\nwas itself illuminated prior to our earliest epoch.\nImmediately surrounding the CS hourglass is the thick\nwaist of extended high-surface brightness, which we call the\n\"belt\" (colored green in Fig. 12i\u2013j). It extends \u00b11 ly along\nthe z\u2032 axis, and from 1.5 to 2.5 ly in radius. Beyond the outer\nradius of this belt, echoes lie fairly well constrained to the\nequator, tracing a thinner (0.5 ly thickness in z\u2032 ) but extended\nequatorial plane (blue in Fig. 12i\u2013j) to an outer radius of \u03c0 \u2032 = 4\nly. The belt does not appear to taper smoothly into the thinner\nequatorial plane, but rather has a fairly sharp transition at its\nouter boundary.\nThe rest of the CS material lies along one of two \"walls.\"\nThe inner wall is colored cyan in Figure 12i\u2013j, extending 1.5\nto 2.6 ly along the axis, and may be considered to join with\nthe hourglass around |z\u2032 | = 1.5 ly. The outer wall, colored\ngold, bridges the belt and the inner wall at radii between 2.6\nand 3.4\u20134.0 ly. We note the conspicuous lack of echo signal\nbetween the hourglass and outer wall around |z\u2032 | = 1.4 ly, and\nquestion whether this is real, perhaps indicative of episodic\nmass loss, or simply a gap in our data.\n4.4. The Geometry of the Outer Rings\nWhile great attention has been placed on the geometry of the ER (Jakobsen et al. 1991; Plait et al. 1995;\nBurrows et al. 1995), relatively little work exists on the ORs\n(see Burrows et al. 1995; Crotts & Heathcote 2000). Now that\na 3-D map of the nebula exists, we can investigate how it can\nconstrains the geometry of the ORs (full details are in in \u00a7??\nof Paper II).\nThe North OR (NOR) appears to lie along the outer edge\nof the north CS hourglass, while the South OR (SOR) seems\nto lie at the intersection between the southern hourglass and\nthe belt, perhaps indicating an interaction between wind that\ncreated the hourglass and the pre-existing belt material.\nThe 3-D positions of the ORs are rendered in Figure 10,\nand appear reasonably planar. We approximate both rings as\n\nF IG . 10.- Probable positions of the ORs (grey) and the planar, elliptical\nfits (black) to each ring, viewed (a) face-on, (b) 60\u25e6 east, (c) 60\u25e6 west, and\n(d) orthogonal to the inclination axis.\n\nTABLE 1\nB EST- FIT ELLIPSES TO THE CS RINGS\nRing\n\nx\u20320\n(ly west)\n\ny\u20320\n(ly north)\n\nz\u20320\n(ly)\n\na\n(ly)\n\nb\n(ly)\n\n\u03c6\n(\u25e6 )\n\nER\nNOR\nSOR\n\n0.015\n0.26\n0.19\n\n0.0\n0.04\n0.06\n\n0.0\n-1.36\n1.00\n\n0.647\n1.42\n1.59\n\n0.98\n0.94\n0.92\n\n81.1\n70.5\n-1.1\n\nplanar ellipses, fit to each distibution of points viewed along\nthe CS inclination axis. The fitted parameters are listed in\nTable 1, where (x\u20320 , y\u20320 ) are the centroid offsets from the axis,\nz\u20320 is the distance to the SN along the axis, (a, b) are the semimajor and minor axes, and \u03c6 is the P.A. of the major axis from\nnorth. For completeness, the parameters for the ER are also\nlisted. These fits are also indicated in black in Figure 10. The\napproximation to the NOR is quite good, but the SOR ellipse\nfails to intersect the points that pass just north and west of\nthe ER. This is not suprising, since no single ellipse can fully\nreproduce the observed shape of the SOR unless it is nonplanar. We have used these planar approximations in the echo\nrenderings throughout this work.\n4.5. Summary\nThe probable geometry and structure of the echoes within\n25\u2032\u2032 of SN 1987A are rendered in Figure 12, and summarized\nin Table 2. The final column gives the approximate total volume of the structure containing each echo, found by integrating the radial profiles in Figures 6, 7, and 9 along, and revolved 2\u03c0 about, the respective inclination axes.\nThe east/west and north/south inclinations are quite consistent, suggesting all circumstellar material shares a common\ninclination near ix = 40\u25e6 south and iy = 8\u25e6 west. Furthermore,\nthe structures appear to join to form a single nebula, as follows. The CS gas is nested neatly within the NH material,\nas shown in Figure 12r, with the CS belt, equatorial plane,\nouter wall, and the waist of NH consistent with a single, uniform thick waist, extending inward to the CS hourglass (Fig.\n12o). The outer edges of the NH hourglass almost reach the\ninner spur of the CD shell (Fig. 12q), and indeed the echoes\nas viewed on the sky do connect at early times (Fig. 5).

Figures are to scale, with the length of the two orientation arrows equal to (a) 10 ly, (b) 4 ly, and (c) 2 ly. Solid lines trace the radial profiles, and the widths of\nthe greyscale regions trace the scatter of points about the averages.\n\nshown in Figure 12m, no material was illuminated along the\nequatorial plane exterior to NH. We do not believe this region was shadowed from the SN by material at smaller radii\n(\u00a75 of this paper, or \u00a7?? of Paper II), thus it is unlikely there\nis any higher density gas outside the waist of NH. As such, we\nconclude the NH hourglass is the pinched waist of the CD.\nFigure 13 shows all circumstellar material, simplified according to the above arguments. The outer structure is peanutlike, extended along the poles to r . 28 ly, and narrowlypinched at the waist at r \u223c 5 ly. We will refer to this outer\nshell (traced by the CD and outer NH echoes) as the \"Peanut.\"\nRoughly 35\u25e6 from the equatorial plane are the spurs, extending 3 \u2212 4 ly out from each lobe, perpendicular to the Peanut's\naxis. Unlike the northwestern WFPC2 echoes, these spurs do\nappear at more than one location, but they are limited enough\nin extent that it is unclear whether they are uniform features\nthat encircle the entire structure, or isolated clumps.\nInside the equatorial region of the Peanut is a thick (\u223c 3.5 ly\nin radial thickness, 2 ly in axial length) annular ring (or belt),\nwhich extends inward until it terminates at the inner CS hourglass. The extent of this waist in z\u2032 is unclear. Echoes were\ndetected outside the CS hourglass at most equatorial (\u03c0 \u2032 ) radii\nbetween 1.6 and 4 ly, with a vertical (z\u2032 ) distribution extending at least as far as the CS hourglass itself. Still, the bulk of\nmaterial is within 1 ly of the equator.\n5. DENSITY AND MASS OF THE CSE\n\nTo constrain the gas density and dust composition of the\nCSE, we apply a dust-scattering model (\u00a7?? of Paper II) using\nthe surface brightnesses of all echoes discussed in the previous section. The reader is referred to \u00a7?? of Paper II for the\ncomplete analysis, as only a brief summary is presented here.\nThe CD echoes are best fit with large (a = 3.5\u00c5\u22122.0\u03bcm)\ngrains consistent with an LMC-abundance of silicate and carbonaceous dust. Outer NH data (r > 5 ly) are more consistent\nwith Si-dominated large grains, but perhaps with a slightlysmaller maximum grain size than for the CD. The inner NH\npoints, along with the CS echoes, are well fit by Si-only dust\nwith amax = 0.2\u03bcm. The general trend is that inner echoes are\nbetter reproduced by smaller, Si-dominated dust, and with increasing distance, the grain sizes and C-content increases.\nFischera, Tuffs, & V\u00f6lk (2002) have modeled mid-IR emission from collisionally-excited dust grains heated in the\nshocks between the CS gas and the forward blast of the\nSN. They find the emission is best explained by small (a .\n\n0.25\u03bcm) grains with a Si-Fe or Si-C composition. The dust\nabundance is quite low, which they attribute to evaporation\nfrom the UV flash and sputtering in the shocked gas. This\nfurther constrains grain sizes to a . 0.25\u03bcm and excludes a\npure-carbon composition. The dust in both this shocked region and the CS hourglass was formed from material expelled\nvery late in the progenitor's life, thus we expect the dust properties to be similar. Indeed, our pre-SN CS dust model also\nfavors silicate-dominated dust with grain sizes a < 0.2\u03bcm.\nThat dust which formed at later times has a smaller carbonaceous content can result from a change in surface CNO abundances over the star's late-stages of evolution, since carbonrich envelopes create carbon-rich dust, while oxygen-rich envelopes create silicate-rich dust. Such CNO processing is also\ninferred from early IUE spectra (Fransson et al. 1989) of the\nER, which show nitrogen and oxygen to be overabundant with\nrespect to carbon.\nThe average dust density is plotted in Figure 14. Figure 13\nhas been greyscale shaded to reflect the differences in density\namong the many echoing structures, with darker grey indicating higher-density material.\nThe innermost CS hourglass material has a relativelyconstant gas density of nH = 2 \u2212 3 cm\u22123 up to r \u223c 1.6 ly. Beyond this position, the material splits into two distributions,\nwhere the steeper profile (r\u22124.5 ) traces the denser waist of the\nhourglass. Beyond r = 2 ly, the shallower (r\u22123 ) profile traces\nthe belt and equatorial plane material, making a smooth transition to the inner NH points around r & 3 ly. That the CS\ndensity varies more steeply than the inverse-square expected\nfor a freely-expanding wind suggests the mass-loss mechanical luminosity (\u1e40v2exp ) increased with time toward the end of\nthe RSG.\nExcluding a density enhancement between r = 4 \u2212 5 ly,\nthere is no evidence of a structural distinction between the\nCS and NH gas, which justifies the simplified model in Figure 13. Returning to the aforementioned enhancement, this\nhigher-density material is located along the waist of the NH\nhourglass, marking an outer edge to the equatorial overdensity. The constituents of the Peanut, the CD and outer NH,\nhave constant density with radius, bounded by 0.02 \u2264 nH \u2264\n0.2 cm\u22123 , suggesting this structure marks a constant-density\nboundary.\nBurrows et al. (1995) argued that if a CS hourglass exists,\nthe fact that it is not observed in recombination (like the three\nrings) implies its density must be . 5 cm\u22123 . This density is\n\n\f10\n\nSugerman et al.\n\nF IG . 12.- Rendered views of the probable structures containing the observed echoes. Top Row: The CD nebula. Second Row: The NH nebula.

These reveal the region between the CS and\nCD structures to be filled with diffuse material (nH . 0.03),\nwhile little structure is seen outside the CD. According to\nFigure 13, the CD and NH form a peanut with a narrowly-\n\npinched waist. If the equatorial dust density is high enough to\ncause significant extinction, material beyond NH will be effectively shadowed from the SN light pulse, in which case no\nechoes would be seen. In \u00a7?? of Paper II, we show that only\na fraction of a magnitude of extinction can be expected from\nknown equatorial material. As this is insufficient to cause pronounced shadowing, the narrow waist appears to be a genuine\nboundary.\n\n\fA New View of SN 1987A\n\n11\n\nTABLE 2\nS UMMARY OF E CHO G EOMETRIES\nStructure\n\nInclinationa\nSouth East Roll\n(\u25e6 )\n(\u25e6 )\n(\u25e6 )\n\nb/a\n\nCross Sectionb\n\u2206x0\n\u2206y0\n(ly)\n(ly)\n\nCS\n\n41\u25e6\n\n-8\u25e6\n\n-9\u25e6\n\n0.94\n\n. 0.1\n\n0.\n\nNH\nCD\n\n40\u25e6\n40\u25e6\n\n-7\u25e6\n-8\u25e6\n\n12\u25e6\n***\n\n0.82\n& 0.95\n\n0.\n< \u22121\n\n0.\n. \u22120.1\n\nShape\n\nr\n(ly)\n\nz\u2032\n(ly)\n\nHourglass\nBelt\nWalls\nHourglass\nProlate\n\n1 \u2212 2.9\n1.5 \u2212 2.8\n1.8 \u2212 4.2\n3 \u2212 11\n10 \u2212 28\n\n0.3 \u2212 2.5\n0. \u2212 1.0\n0.8 \u2212 2.7\n0.7 \u2212 7.5\n4 \u2212 28\n\nGeometryc\n\u03c0\u2032\n(ly)\n0.8 \u2212 1.6\n1.5 \u2212 2.6\n1.8 \u2212 3.6\n2.8 \u2212 7.5\n0 \u2212 16\n\n\u2206\u03c0 \u2032\n(ly)\n0.5 \u2212 1\n1.5 \u2212 2.0\n2.0 \u2212 3.0\n2\u22124\n4\u22125\n\nVtot\n(ly3 )\n20\n40\n120\n1300\n1.2 \u00d7 104\n\na \"Roll\" is the counter-clockwise rotation about the z axis, also the P.A. of the minor axis after removing the southern inclination and eastern\nrotation.\nb \u2206x and \u2206y are the western and northern offsets of the symmetry axis from the SN, which is at x = 0, y = 0.\n0\n0\nc r is the spherical-polar distance from the SN. \u03c0 \u2032 is the cylindrical-polar radius measured from the inclined axis z\u2032 . \u2206\u03c0 \u2032 is the approximate\n\u2032\nwidth along \u03c0 .

Figure is to scale, and orientation arrows indicate\n10 ly.\n\nThe total mass of gas and dust within the CSE is estimated\nfrom the average density and volume of each structure, as\ngiven in Figure 14 and Table 2. The volume interior to the\nCD is estimated a few ways: as the volume of the ellipsoid\nenclosed by the CD, as the volume of two cones enclosed by\nthe quasi-linear profile, and as the integrated volume under\nthe same profile (Fig. 6). All three methods give a consistent\nresult of about 6500 ly3 . The calculated masses are listed in\nTable 3, yielding a total mass in all structures of \u223c 1.7M\u2299\n(assuming an LMC gas-to-dust mass ratio of 400\u2013600). It is\nvery difficult to quantify all the sources of error, but we believe the tendency will be to underpredict the masses of the\nstructures, given conservative measurements of their volume\nand the unknown extent to which dust was not observable,\ndue to unfavorable geometry, poor data quality, confusion, or\npossible shadowing.\n6. PREVIOUS FORMATION MODELS\n\nAs discussed briefly in \u00a71, the progenitor's pre-explosion\nspectral type, as well as the early SN evolution, argue Sk\n\u221269\u25e6 202 exploded as a BSG. Evidence of pre-existing CS\nmaterial, and nitrogen enrichment within that material, imply\nthe star first passed through a RSG phase, executing a \"blue\nloop\" to return to a BSG prior to core collapse.\nMass loss can explain this blue loop, however only\nif the star loses either a small fraction or nearly all\nof its hydrogen envelope (Woosley, Pinto & Ensman 1988;\n\nWoosley, Pinto & Weaver 1988; Nomoto et al. 1988). While\nthe latter option is ruled out by observations (Dopita 1988;\nWalborn et al. 1989), even low mass loss can qualitatively account for the observed CSE via interacting stellar winds (or\nISW, Kwok 1982; Balick, Preston & Icke 1987). Originally\nproposed to explain planetary nebulae, a slow, dense wind\nfrom the evolved star (or RSG) is overtaken by a fast, tenuous one, accelerated from the hot, blue core (or BSG). In\nparticular, inhomogeneities in the winds, such as equatorial\noverdensities, shock focus the winds into characteristic bipolar shapes.\nUnfortunately, the formation mechanisms of such overdensities are poorly understood. Morris (1981, 1987) proposed that a binary companion can create an overdensity\nin the primary wind within the pair's orbital plane, while\nSoker & Livio (1994) argue that this configuration can drive\nhigh-velocity jets out of that plane. Two models exist for\nthe creation of a disk by single stars. A rotation-induced bistability (Lamers & Pauldrach 1991) produces a larger massloss or lower wind-velocity at the equator than the poles, resulting from the high sensitivity of line-driven winds to optical depth. Bjorkman & Cassinelli (1993) have introduced the\nmodel of a wind-compressed disk (WCD), in which the orbital\nstreamlines of gas launched from the northern and southern\nhemispheres of a star collide, producing an equatorial overdensity.\nMany of these mechanisms have been invoked to explain\nthe formation of the three-ring nebula, which has been the\nmost prominent feature of the CSE. In the following subsections, we review these models, and compare their predictions\nto the complete nebula revealed by light echoes. In short, we\nfind that no extant model can adequately reproduce this system, however a number of features among them may offer\nsome insight into the progentor's probable mass-loss history.\n6.1. Interacting Stellar Winds Models\nLuo & McCray (1991b) first invoked the ISW model to\nexplain the emerging picture of an hourglass-shaped nebula\ncontaining the three rings. Using the thin-shell approximation (Mac Low & McCray 1988) in which all swept-up material lies in a thin shell with an isobaric interior (effectively\na momentum-conserving snowplow), they simulated the collision of a fast, tenuous BSG wind with an older, slow and\ndense RSG outflow. Since, this collision has been studied\nwith 2-D hydrodynamic simulations by Blondin & Lundqvist\n(1993) and Martin & Arnett (1995).\n\n\f12\n\nSugerman et al.\n\nF IG . 14.- Average gas densities that match observed echo fluxes to the dust-scattering model. Point colors correspond to those in the two right columns of\nFig. 12. CS material is marked by circles, NH by squares, CD by triangles, and smaller symbols denote measurements with S/N < 2. Dotted lines are the best-fits\nthrough the upper and lower CS loci, corresponding to n \u221d r \u22123.1 (upper) and n \u221d r \u22124.5 (lower). Horizontal dashed lines delineate the rough density boundaries of\nthe CD gas.\n\nA number of results are similar between all of these models. (1) A bipolar or hourglass nebula can be formed via this\nISW framework that roughly matches the size and expansion\nvelocities of the rings. (2) To match these constraints, an extraordinary asymmetry is required in the RSG mass loss, producing a significant equatorial density enhancement over that\nat the poles. We note that this conclusion is a result of the\nsimulations, not an input condition. (3) The wind parameters necessary to produce this nebula are consistent with average values of other stars, with the RSG characterized by\na mass loss \u1e40R = 6 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , wind velocity\nvR = 8 \u2212 10 km s\u22121 , and lifetime \u03c4R < 106 yr, and the BSG\nby \u1e40B = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , vB = 300 \u2212 550 km s\u22121 ,\nand \u03c4B = 104 yr.\nAs predicted above, we do find an extended equatorial overdensity in Figure 13. However, compared to this newlyrevealed CSE, the models all have significant shortcomings.\nForemost, nearly all the predicted CS nebulae are quite flattened and oblate (mushroom shaped), inconsistent with the\nprolate, hourglass shape we have mapped out. To generate\nroughly the right shape, the equatorial expansion velocities\nbecome far too large, while matching these velocities can lead\nto RSG mass-loss rates that are too high. Although these models can explain the formation of the ER, they fail to explain\nthe existence of the ORs. This may be linked to the fact that\nalmost all model hourglass nebulae have solid capping surfaces, which we do not observe. Finally, the adoption of a preexisting RSG asymmetry is entirely ad hoc, and these models\nmake no attempt to explain how such an asymmetry formed,\nnor to model what geometry its interface with the MS bubble\nshould be.\n6.2. A Wind-Compressed Disk Model\nCollins et al. (1999) have attempted to address one shortcoming in previous work by assuming that the RSG wind\nforms a WCD from which the density asymmetry is derived.\nIn contrast to the above work, they also allow for a velocity asymmetry in the RSG wind, as defined by the disk. A\nWCD is characterized by the rotation parameter \u03a9 = Vrot /Vcrit ,\nthe ratio of the stellar rotation rate to the break-up speed.\nFor rotations less than a threshold value \u03a9 < \u03a9th , the star\nforms a wind-compressed zone with an equator-to-pole density contrast of 3\u201310, while for \u03a9 > \u03a9th a WCD forms with\ndensity contrasts \u223c 100. By varying the WCD parameters,\nCollins et al. (1999) varied the RSG-wind environment surrounding the star, establishing the initial conditions for a BSG\n\nwind. This they addressed using self-similar solutions of\nwind-blown bubbles from Dwarkadas, Chevalier, & Blondin\n(1996).\nFor their fiducial model (a RSG with 20M\u2299 , which is too\nhigh from stellar-evolution arguments), they find \u03a9th \u223c 0.3,\nwhich produces a density contrast of 25. A variation of the\nrotation parameter between \u03a9 = 0.3 \u2212 0.36 produces peanutshaped nebulae with equatorial expansion velocities of 8\u201310\nkm s\u22121 and a maximum (cylindrical) lobe radius roughly twice\nthat in the equator (consistent with the diameters of the ORs\nand ER), for RSG wind parameters \u1e40R \u223c 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and\nvR = 20 km s\u22121 , and BSG parameters \u1e40B \u223c 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and\nvB = 400 km s\u22121 . A WCD is not required to produce a peanut,\nas a dense equatorial zone is sufficient. Again, the peanut\nshape does not fit the observed CS hourglass, however they\naddress this by noting that in simulations (Frank & Mellema\n1994), the BSG wind can be shock-focused into the polar\ndirection, resulting in a substantially-more prolate structure\nthan that predicted from a self-similar solution.\nA few results stand out from this work. (1) The WCD is a\nstraightforward explanation for the observed equatorial density enhancement. (2) The authors do not find the need to\ninvoke unusually low BSG wind momentum or RSG velocity,\nalthough the RSG mass-loss rate is much higher than we deduce in \u00a77.2. (3) A single RSG star cannot rotate at \u03a9 & 0.25\nwithout the influence of a binary companion. Collins et al.\n(1999) estimate that a lower limit of 0.6M\u2299 for the companion is sufficient to produce the necessary rotation speeds for\nthis model. If rotation is to be invoked as a formation mechanism, then the progenitor had to have been a binary system.\n6.3. Binary Models\nBinarity has been invoked by Posdiadlowski & Joss (1989)\nand Podsiadlowski, Joss, & Rappaport (1990) among others\nto explain the observed characteristics of the SN. A companion could have been engulfed by Sk \u221269\u25e6 202 during a\ncommon-envelope phase; however, for lower mass primaries,\nthe secondary can cause dynamical instabilities that eject the\nprimary envelope (Rasio & Livio 1996), a process that is not\nsuggested from the SN evolution.\nSoker (1999) invokes the influence of a binary companion to produce the observed three-ring nebula, but his results\nare inconsistent with the ensemble of data presented here.\nPodsiadlowski, Fabian, & Stevens (1991) suggest that the collision of winds between the primary and secondary spread out\nthe wind into a truncated double cone. This is a novel forma-\n\n\fA New View of SN 1987A\ntion mechanism for the hourglass feature we observe; however, their geometric model further predicts that Napoleon's\nHat lies on the northern-half of the cone, which we now know\nto be false.\nLloyd, O'Brien, & Kahn (1995) suggest a variant on the\ndouble-cone scenario, in which the BSG wind sweeps up the\nbase of the cones, leaving the end surfaces as the ORs. Furthermore, dynamical friction causes the secondary to coalesce\ninto the primary, ejecting the envelope, thereby forming the\nER. Again, this model is attractive as it suggests that a single mechanism formed all three rings. A testable prediction is\nthat extensive RSG double-cone material should exist at and\nbeyond the ring positions, however we see no evidence for\nsuch material in light echoes. If binarity is to explain the formation of the three rings, these models must be revisited to be\nconsistent with the new picture of the complete CSE.\n6.4. Ionization\nAll the above models have neglected the effects of ionization on the evolution of ISWs. The progenitor MS star is expected to emit an ionizing flux of S = 2 \u00d7 1048 \u03b3 s\u22121 , while the\nB3 I BSG star should emit S = 4 \u00d7 1045 \u03b3 s\u22121 (Panagia 1973),\nboth of which are sufficient to drive an ionization front ahead\nof the outer shock.\nChevalier & Dwarkadas (1995) have addressed the role of\nionization in the to explain the reappearance of radio emission three years after outburst (Manchester et al. 2002). Their\nmodel of a pre-SN H II region suggests that the BSG had\na mass loss of only \u1e40B = 8 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 with vB = 450\nkm s\u22121 . Furthermore, the ionization front that formed this\nH II region would move rapidly through the lower-density polar regions of the hourglass, and could have broken out of\nthe lobes, thereby eliminating any capping-surface to the CS\nhourglass. This is a particularly interesting scenario for explaining the observed geometry of the CS hourglass, as well\nas the evolution of the SN remnant across the spectrum.\nMeyer (1997) has proposed that an ionization front in the\nBSG phase induces hydrodynamic motions in the pre-existing\nasymmetric RSG wind. These motions create a latitudinallydependent density profile that peaks about 50\u25e6 above the\nequator, which he identifies as the outer rings, however Soker\n(1999) and Crotts & Heathcote (2000) have offered a few objections to this scenario. Fully-radiative hydrodynamic simulations including ionization are necessary to test these ideas.\n7. CONSTRAINTS ON THE EVOLUTION OF SK \u221269\u25e6 202\n\nWe now investigate what constraints the geometry and density of the CSE can place on the progenitor's evolution.\n7.1. The Main Sequence Bubble\nWe begin by discussing the possible mass-loss scenarios for\nthe MS progenitor, since the impact of these winds on the\nsurrounding ISM forms the initial conditions for subsequent\nmass-loss evolution. Chevalier & Emmering (1989) note that\nthe wind should have blown a bubble > 10 pc in radius,\nwhose interior homogenized as the star evolved onto the RSG\nbranch.\nLet us assume that Sk \u221269\u25e6 202 was a zero-age MS type O9\nV with 18\u201320M\u2299 (Chevalier & Emmering 1989), luminosity\n104.9 L\u2299 and radius 8R\u2299 (Panagia 1973), yielding a MS massloss rate of \u1e40MS \u223c 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Nieuwenhuijzen & de Jager\n1990). The interaction of a long-lived stellar wind with\nthe ISM was first investigated by Castor, McCray, & Weaver\n\n13\nTABLE 3\nM ASS OF THE CSM\nStructure\n\nM/M\u2299\n\nCS Hourglass\nCS Belt\nCS Walls\nNH Waist\nNH Walls\nIntra-CD\nCD\nTotal\n\n0.04\n0.04\n0.06\n0.06\n0.07\n0.2\n1.2\n1.7\n\n(1975) and Weaver et al.

Xu et al.\n(1995) find that SN 1987A is positioned roughly 1 kpc behind the edge of the LMC, and if one assumes Star 2 is near\nthe SN, these yield an average ISM density of n0 =0.4 cm\u22123 .\nFor L36 = 0.07 \u2212 0.2, the progenitor wind will maintain an\nadiabatic shock for 0.3\u20131.3 Myr. As this is much shorter than\ntMS , the bubble will become radiative at a radius of 27\u201381\nly. Assuming the sound speed of the undisturbed ISM is 10\nkm s\u22121 , the radiative shock front will reach this speed and stall\nin another \u223c0.8 Myr. Following the arguments in D'Ercole\n(1992), adiabatic shocks become radiative at radii larger than\nthose at which radiative shocks would have stalled. As such,\nthe shock must recede, stalling at a new radius of 26-42 ly.\nThere are subtle indications in our density measurements\nof an enhancement 80\u2013100 ly from the SN, which may be\nthe remnant of the MS-ISM snowplow. However, given the\nsmall expected mechanical luminosity of the progenitor, we\nquestion whether the Peanut is actually the remnant of that\ninteraction. Alternatively, the MS bubble may be traced by\nechoes seen roughly 100 pc from the SN by Xu et al. (1995).\n7.2. Red Supergiant Mass Loss\nFollowing the end of the MS, the gas density within its\nequilibrated bubble is expected to be quite low, and for a\nlarge RSG mass-loss rate, the swept-up mass within the driven\nshock will be much lower than the mass of shocked wind. The\nRSG mass-loss rate can be estimated from the mass contained\nwithin this structure (\u223c1.6 M\u2299 , Table 3) and an adopted\nRSG lifetime of 3 \u00d7 105 yr (Martin & Arnett 1995), yielding\n\u1e40R \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , consistent with ISW models. A wind\nvelocity of 10 km s\u22121 corresponds to a mechanical luminosity\nof L36 = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 which, expanding into a tenuous medium,\nis classified by Koo & McKee (1992a) as a \"slow wind\" that\nbecomes radiative almost immediately. Note that this rate is\nan upper limit if the MS bubble is small, as suggested above.\n\n\f14\n\nSugerman et al.\n\n7.3. Inhomogeneities\nIf the Peanut is the RSG-MS contact discontinuity, then its\nshape is a fossil record of the hydrodynamic interaction between these two media. Here, we investigate whether the observed Peanut can be explained by a simple asymmetry in the\nRSG wind, or whether external factors need to be invoked.\nConsider the CD shell (Fig. 11a, which has an elongated, prolate shape, closest to the SN just above the equatorial plane\n(r \u223c 11 ly), and farthest toward the poles (r . 28 ly). A slow,\nradiative shock propagates as R(t) \u221d L1/4 t 1/2 , thus for the RSG\nwind to have formed this pinched structure in the absence of\nany external inhomogeneities, the wind luminosity above the\nequator must have been roughly 3% that at the pole.\nD'Ercole (1992) find that radiative shocks stall at Rm =\n1/2 \u22121/2\n22.2L36 n0 . For the RSG wind from Sk \u221269\u25e6 202 to have\nstalled at the poles with L36 = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 , the ambient MSbubble density must be n0 = 10\u22124 cm\u22123 . Similar average values can be determined by considering the MS mass-loss rate\nand bubble size. With 3% of the polar wind luminosity, the\nequatorial wind would have stalled at 5 ly, which is less than\nhalf the observed position of the CD shell. It appears that the\nobserved geometry of the Peanut cannot be explained by only\nan asymmetry in the RSG wind.\nOne solution is that the CSM in the MS-bubble is not homogenous, but that the MS winds had an asymmetry similar to that of the RSG. Typically, one argues that the average temperature inside the MS bubble should have been sufficiently high for any inhomogeneities to smooth out, making this scenario unlikely. An asymmetric freely-expanding\nflow into a homogenous post-shock medium will create\nan asymmtric inner termination shock. The simulations\nof Garcia-Segura, Langer, & Mac Low (1996) show that this\nshock collapses into RSG wind before the system settles anew\ninto a steady flow. Thus it may be possible for a MS-wind\nasymmetry to be imprinted on subsequent outflows. An alternative is that the CD had a smaller size and asymmetry at\nthe end of the RSG, and a second wind blew it into the shape\ncurrently observed, which we consider in greater detail in the\nnext subsection.\n7.4. A Two-Loop Scenario\nMartin & Arnett (1995) have modelled the evolution of\nmetal poor stars between 19\u201321 M\u2299 using the stellar evolution code from Arnett (1991). All of these make one full blue\nloop and then return to the red, with only the models under\n20.5 M\u2299 finishing a second loop to end as a BSG. Such stars\nspend roughly 107 yr in the MS, 2.3 \u00d7 105 and 3.2 \u00d7 105 yr\nin the first RSG and BSG, and 4.7 \u00d7 104 and 2.4 \u00d7 104 yr in\nthe second RSG and BSG, respectively. We propose that the\nstructures revealed by light echoes may be explained by such\nan evolutionary scenario. In particular, a long-duration BSG\nwind expanding into an asymmetric RSG environment could\nbe the second wind hypothesized above.\nQualitatively, the hourglass-shaped bubbles resulting from\nISW simulations are poor matches to the CS hourglass, yet\nthey have many similarities to the Peanut (Fig. 15). The\nflattened, oblate (or mushroom-shaped) lobes with narrowlypinched waists from simulations are very similar to the inner\nwalls and conical-shell contributions to the Peanut. This is\nshown schematically in Figure 15, in which the inward-facing\nshock (thin grey curve), dense contact discontinuity (thick\ngrey curve) and vortex (grey arrowed curve) from Figure 2\nof Martin & Arnett (1995) are shown at left, and compared\n\nF IG . 15.- Schematic showing a qualitative formation scenario for the\nPeanut. At left, the grey curves trace the favored model of BSG/RSG interaction from Martin & Arnett (1995). Pressure or momentum directed toward\nthe poles (arrows) blow this mushroom into a peanut shape (black dotted\nlines). At right, one quadrant of the simplified Peanut from Fig. 13.\n\non the right to one quadrant of the CD structure from Figure\n13. Of note in Martin & Arnett (1995), a dense vortex appears at the outer edge of the prolate lobe, which is tempting\nto identify with the \"spurs\" located just outside the CD.\nWe envision the following evolutionary sequence. A BSG\naccelerates wind into previously-expelled RSG material, creating a mushroom-shaped discontinuity. This BSG wind is\nsteady and long-lived, and the interface expands self-similarly\n(Dwarkadas et al. 1996) to the size of the CD/NH Peanut.\nMany mechanisms exist to direct momentum and pressure toward the polar region (indicated by black arrows in Fig. 15),\nelongating the mushroom into the prolate peanut shape we observe. These include: (1) shock focusing of the BSG wind by\nequatorial material (see Collins et al. 1999), and preferential\nexpansion into the lower density polar regions of (2) an adiabatic shock or (3) an ionization front (Chevalier & Dwarkadas\n1995). The star then loops back to the red, and for a few\u00d7104\nyears fills in some fraction of the cavity blown out by the\nfirst BSG wind. These three mass-loss phases produce an\nextensive equatorial overdensity, which directs a substantial\namount of the final BSG wind in the polar direction, carving\nout an hourglass-shaped nebula with no end caps.\nOne major discrepancy between the ISW models and the\nCSE as revealed through echoes is that the models assume\nthere is a very extensive equatorial disk of RSG material.\nWhether the equatorial material we do see is sufficient to form\nthe rest of the bipolar structures must be tested in hydrodynamic simulations.\nIn addition to providing a natural mechanism for formation of the equatorial overdensity via a WCD, stellar rotation\nmay also explain the progenitor's evolutionary blue loop(s)\n(Meynet 2004), and should be revisited with hydrodynamic\nmodels. From Figure 14, we find a maximum equator-to-pole\ndensity contrast of 10 between the NH equator and the furthest CD material. This is small compared to values found\nby Collins et al. (1999), suggesting the evolved star may only\nhave produced a wind-compressed zone and therefore did not\nhave an extremely high rotation rate. However, since a rotating star spins down as it loses mass on the MS and as it swells\ninto a RSG, any significant RSG rotation requires some mech-\n\n\fA New View of SN 1987A\nanism for spinning up the star, such as a close binary companion.\n8. CONCLUSION\n\nOnce it was realized that Sk -69\u25e6 202 was surrounded by\nan extensive CS nebula, it became clear that the closest observed SN in 400 years would also provide the first opportinity\nto observe the destruction of that nebula (e.g. Luo & McCray\n1991a; Borkowski, Blondin & McCray 1997b), and the birth\nof a supernova remnant (SNR), both spatially resolved and in\nreal-time. This event thus serves as a vital test to models of\nSN evolution, radiative shock processes, and SNR formation.\nAs noted in the introduction, the ejecta-CSE interaction will\ndirectly illuminate the structures it impacts, and the highenergy emission from the resulting hot gas will illuminate\nmany other regions of the CSE via photoionization. The results from this work will be tested by this interaction, and be\ncritical in interpreting the panchromatic spectacle that will ensue.\nAlready, the \"hot spots\" detailing the impact of the ejecta\nwith the inner edge of the ER (Lawrence et al. 2000) confirm\nthe observed spatial offset between the SN and inner nebulae.\nSugerman et al. (2002) show that roughly 43 of the hot spots\nare located along the eastern half of the ER, while spots toward that half of the ring are also closer to the SN than those\nto the west. Both of these are suggestive of an ER that is offset\nto the west of the SN, consistent with our findings in \u00a74.3.\nAn alternative interpretation to the hot spot positions and\norder of appearance is that the circumstellar medium into\nwhich the ejecta propagate is asymmetrically denser to the\neast (Michael et al. 2002). Is such an imprint visible in lightecho data?\nStellar winds propagating into uniform media travel faster\nand farther with increasing mechanical luminosity \u03c1v2\n(Weaver et al. 1977). A higher wind density to the east would\nimply that the CD boundary separating the RSG wind from\nthe MS bubble should be more distant from the SN in that direction. In \u00a74.1, we find that the CD does appear marginally\noffset from the SN toward the east. Although by no means\nconclusive, this is suggestive that an eastern asymmetry was\npresent in the stellar winds as early as the RSG.\nIf the RSG outflows had been denser toward the east, then\nthe inner cavity which the BSG wind carved out would be\ncloser to the central star in that direction as well. This would\nhave resulted in an observed ER and CS hourglass that are\noffset west of the SN, and an overall density enhancement\nwithin the equatorial plane to the east. This qualitative argument is again consistent with the observed geometry of the\n\n15\n\ninner CS structures (\u00a74.3). Unfortunately, the inferred densities from \u00a75 are too uncertain to permit a meaningful study of\nazimuthal asymmetries.\nIn keeping with the binary-star hypotheses to explain the\nobserved CSE, one could also invoke binarity as the cause\nfor the east-west wind asymmetry. For example, a secondary\nin a resonant, eccentric orbit could tidally distort the primary when near pericenter, and from the von Zeipel theorem\n(1924), the radiative flux would temporarily drop at this distortion, with an associated local drop in wind momentum (for\na radiatively-driven wind), yielding a longitudinal wind asymmetry.\nAnother mechanism that could cause a longintudinally\nasymmetric wind is proper motion of the mass-losing star\nthrough the ISM. This was first treated by Weaver et al.\n(1977) and more recently by e.g. Wilkin (1996) and\nComeron & Kaper (1998). A slow, westward motion of the\nprogenitor through the ISM would pile up more material at\nthe western wind-ISM contact discontinuity than to the east.\nSimilarly, the star would be closer to this western discontinuity than to the west. Such an effect has been seen for PNe\n(Tweedy & Kwitter 1996) and for the LMC luminous blue\nvariable S119 (Danforth & Chu 2001). A proper motion of\nless than 0.1 km s\u22121 is required to produce the observed offets, however, this scenario is predicated on the progenitor not\nblowing an ISM bubble during its MS that is larger than any\nof the CS structures revealed in this paper. We look forward\nto a new generation of hydrodynamical models that will readdress the mechanisms of mass loss in Sk \u221269\u25e6 202, and subsequently the phenomena of bipolar mass loss in many more\nsystems.\n\nB.E.K.S. wishes to thank Alex Bergier, Eric Blackman,\nRoger Chevalier, Adam Frank, Peter Lundqvist, Geralt\nMellema, and Robert Uglesich.
