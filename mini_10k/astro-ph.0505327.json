Astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of information on the electron spin state, and these are normally averaged in obtaining the requisite\nrates. In magnetic fields, higher order quantum processes such as Compton scattering become resonant\nat the cyclotron frequency and its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent. Such divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of excited Landau states. This\npractice requires the use of spin-dependent cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations\nof process rates very near cyclotronic resonances, the phase space domain most relevant for certain applications to pulsar models. This paper develops previous results in the literature to obtain compact\nanalytic expressions for cyclotron decay rates/widths in terms of a series of Legendre functions of the\nsecond kind; these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models. The rates are derived\nusing two popular eigenstate formalisms, namely that due to Sokolov and Ternov, and that due to Johnson and Lippmann. These constitute two sets of eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation that diagonalize\ndifferent operators, and accordingly yield different spin-dependent cyclotron rates. This paper illustrates\nthe attractive Lorentz transformation characteristics of the Sokolov and Ternov formulation, which is\nanother reason why it is preferable when electron spin information must be explicitly retained.\nSubject headings: radiation mechanisms: non-thermal - magnetic fields - relativity - stars: neutron\n- pulsars: general - gamma rays: theory\nThe quantum electrodynamical (QED) cross section for\nCompton scattering at the cyclotron fundamental (Herold 1979)\nand higher harmonics (Daugherty & Harding 1986, Bussard,\nAlexander & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1986), accurate in arbitrarily high magnetic fields, has been known for some time. However, these\nderivations do not treat the natural line widths that render the\ncross section finite at the cyclotron resonances. In order to use\nsuch rates in spectral calculations in astrophysical models, the\nline widths that originate from the lifetimes of the excited Landau states must be included in the cross section (Wasserman &\nSalpeter 1980). The width of the nth resonance is equal to the\ncyclotron decay rate from that state (Pavlov et al. 1991), and\nthe prescription for incorporating the widths in the QED cross\nsection in the high-field regime has been discussed by Harding &\nDaugherty (1991) and Graziani (1993). Including resonant line\nwidths in the scattering cross section necessarily requires spindependent decay rates, which appear in an infinite sum over\nLandau state n and spin of the intermediate virtual states, even\nin the case of ground state-to-ground state scattering in the fundamental. Different spin states have different decay rates, and\nthus different resonant energy denominators. Since the electrons and positrons in intermediate states have non-zero momentum parallel to the magnetic field, it is important to use\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe number of astrophysical sources thought to possess surface magnetic fields above the quantum critical field strength\nof Bcr = m2e c3 /(e~) \u2248 4.413 \u00d7 1013 G has been steadily growing in recent years. The five presently known Soft Gamma-Ray\nRepeaters (SGRs) and six or seven Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars\n(AXPs) are believed to be magnetars, neutron stars having surface fields in the range 1014 \u2212 1015 G (Duncan & Thompson\n1992). In addition, the Parkes Multibeam survey (Manchester\net al. 2001) has discovered at least six new radio pulsars that\nhave surface fields near or above critical, and several with fields\ncomparable to those of some of the magnetars. The radiation\nprocesses that determine the observed X-ray and gamma-ray\nspectra in these sources are operating in the extreme relativistic\nand quantum regimes and thus require treatment that is accurate in such environments. One process that is particularly\nimportant in the source emission models is resonant Compton\nscattering, in which electrons scatter photons at the cyclotron\nresonance with a cross section much larger than at continuum\nenergies. Relativistic electrons can blue-shift low energy photons into the resonance, upscattering the photons into a highenergy continuum (Daugherty & Harding 1989, Dermer 1990).\n1\n\n\f2\nbasis states that yield a spin dependence that is Lorentz invariant, i.e. boosts along the magnetic field do not lead to a mixing\nbetween the spin states.\nAs is true for all quantum processes, the spin-dependent rates\nand cross sections depend on the choice of electron wavefunctions in a uniform magnetic field. Historically, several choices of\nwavefunctions have been used in calculations of the scattering\ncross section and cyclotron decay rates. The two most widely\nused wavefunctions are those of Johnson & Lippman (1949) and\nSokolov & Ternov (1968). The Johnson & Lippman (JL) wavefunctions are derived in Cartesian coordinates and are eigenstates of the kinetic momentum operator. The Sokolov & Ternov\n(ST) wavefunctions, specifically their \"transverse polarization\"\nstates, are derived in cylindrical coordinates and are eigenfunctons of the magnetic moment operator. Given the different spin\ndependence of the ST and JL eigenstates, one must use caution\nin making the appropriate choice when treating spin-dependent\nprocesses. Herold, Ruder & Wunner (1982) and Melrose and\nParle (1983) have noted that the ST eigenstates have desirable properties that the JL states do not possess, such as being\neigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian including radiation corrections, having symmetry between positron and electron states,\nand diagonalization of the self-energy shift operator. As found\nby Graziani (1993), the ST wavefunctions also diagonalize the\nLandau-Dirac operator, and are the physically correct choices\nfor spin-dependent treatments and for incorporating widths in\nthe scattering cross section. Although the spin-averaged ST\nand JL cyclotron decay rates are equal, the spin-dependent decay rates are not, except in the special case in which the initial\nmomentum of the electron parallel to the field vanishes.\nPerhaps the most fundamental argument against use of the\nJL wavefunctions is that radiative corrections cause excited JL\nLandau levels to become unstable to spin-flip transition within\nLandau states on timescales comparable to the timescale for decay to a lower Landau n state. These radiative corrections to\nthe magnetic moment break the spin degeneracy of both the ST\nand JL excited Landau states (Herold, Ruder & Wunner 1982),\ncausing spin-dependent energy level shifts, and implying a dependence of the rates for spin-flip transitions within a Landau\nstate on the choice of wavefunctions. The rates of such spin-flip\ntransitions within split ST Landau states have been evaluated\n(Gepr\u00e4gs et al. 1994; see also Parle 1987), and are found to\nbe of order of \u03b16f (B/Bcr )4 for B \u226a Bcr , which is negligible\ncompared to decay rates between Landau states. The existence\nof such relatively long-lived states is a premise of the S-matrix\nformalism and is also essential to any astrophysical calculations\ninvolving spin-dependent transitions between Landau states. In\ncontrast, it is anticipated that since the JL eigenstates do not\ndiagonalize the self-interaction Hamiltonian including radiation\ncorrections (i.e. the mass operator), the associated mixing incurred in S-matrix evaluations will render spin-flip transition\nrates with fixed n comparable to ordinary cyclotronic rates with\nchanges in n , a situation that is unphysical.\nIn this paper we discuss the Lorentz tranformation characteristics of cyclotron decay rates for both ST and JL formulations,\nand derive simplified expressions for the decay rates from an\narbritrary excited Landau state to the ground state. We show\nthat the ST eigenstates preserve separability of the spin dependence under Lorentz boosts along the local magnetic field,\na desirable property that does not extend to the JL formalism, for which such Lorentz boosts mix the corresponding spin\nstates. In the ST formulation, by taking advantage of its spinstate preserving characteristics, our analytic simplifications can\n\nbe elegantly applied to the spin-dependent decay rates; in the\nJL formalism the simplifications can be compactly applied only\nto the spin-averaged rates. The resulting expressions replace\nintegrals over emergent photon angle with series of Legendre\nfunctions of the second kind, which correspond to sums of elementary functions, easily yielding simple asymptotic forms.\nThe expressions derived here should have wide applicability\nto modeling cyclotron emission, Compton scattering and other\nQED processes in super-critical fields. For such magnetar-type\nfields, resonant scattering takes place primarily at the fundamental, since the cyclotron energy exceeds 1 MeV. Although\nthe resonant scattering line widths formally involve infinite sums\nover Landau states, in the case of the fundamental resonance the\nsum is dominated by the n = 1 state, whose width is equal to the\nn \u2192 0 cyclotron decay rate. For cyclotron scattering in higher\nharmonics l > 0, the intermediate sums in the vertex functions\nhave the largest contributions from the n = l + 1 state. However, for B \u226b Bcr , cyclotron transitions to the ground Landau\nstate dominate (Sokolov, Zhukovskii & Nikitina 1973, White\n1974, Harding & Preece 1987), so that cyclotron decay rates for\nn \u2192 0 transitions treated in this paper should be good approximations to the widths of excited states, a circumstance pertinent\nto astrophysical models of magnetars.\n2. CYCLOTRON RATES: SOKOLOV AND TERNOV FORMALISM\n\nThis presentation of spin-dependent cyclotron rates appropriately focuses first on the formulation generated using the transverse polarization eigenstates of the Dirac equation derived by\nSokolov & Ternov (1968) for electrons in a uniform magnetic\nfield B. Explicit forms for them can also be found in Herold,\nRuder & Wunner (1982) and Harding & Preece (1987), whose\nexposition on cyclotron emission essentially forms the basis of\nresults developed here. Herold et al. observed that these states\ndiagonalize the operator that describes the electronic self-energy\nshift in an external magnetic field. Another attractive feature\nof the Sokolov & Ternov eigenstates is that they possess charge\nconjugation symmetries, i.e. between electron (positive energy)\nand positron (negative energy): see Eq. (12) of Herold, Ruder\n& Wunner (1982). An additional asset of these wavefunctions\nthat is enunciated here is that they yield cyclotron rates whose\nspin dependence is effectively separable from Lorentz transformations along the field: i.e. such boosts do not mix spin states.\nThis is a very useful characteristic that is not present in the\nJohnson & Lippmann formalism addressed in Section 3 below.\nHerold, Ruder & Wunner (1982) obtained general expressions\nin their Eq. (17) for the spin-dependent cyclotron rate for transitions between arbitrary Landau levels, but for the case of zero\ninitial momentum p parallel to the field. Latal (1986) independently obtained similar results for cyclotron transitions to the\nground state, but retained arbitrary initial momenta p along B;\nhis Eq. (22) forms the starting point for the exposition here. Denoting \u03b6 = \u00b11 as the spin quantum number of the initial electron, ground state transitions are characterized by a single final\nspin \u03b6 \u2032 = \u22121 . The energy level quantum numbers are initially\nn , and n\u2032 = 0 after the transition.

No intecos \u03b8 = ~k.B/|\ngration by parts has been performed when obtaining Eq.

Only momentum parallel to the field is conserved, since the system is not\ntranslationally-invariant orthogonal to B.

Lorentz Transformation Properties\nThere is no need to compute Eq. (2) as it stands for arbitrary\np . Instead, one can appeal to a simple Lorentz transformation\nprotocol. Consider boosts along the field between the inertial\nframe where the initial electron possesses momentum p along\nthe field, and that frame where the initial parallel momentum\nis zero. In this latter \"rest\" frame let \u03bc0 be the photon angle cosine with respect to B, p0 = 0 be the initial parallel e\u2212\nmomentum, and the initial electron energy be denoted\n\u221a\n(10)\n\u03b5n = 1 + 2nB .\nThen, for a dimensionless\nboost velocity \u03b2 \u2261 v/c and Lorentz\np\nfactor \u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 along B, the initial electron quantities\nin Eq. (2) satisfy\nEn\n\n= \u03b3(\u03b5n \u2212 \u03b2p0 ) \u2261 \u03b3\u03b5n\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n= \u03b3(p0 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b5n ) \u2261 \u2212\u03b3\u03b2\u03b5n ,\np\nfrom which \u03b2 = \u2212p/En = \u2212p/ 1 + 2nB + p2 is established.\nThe photon angle cosine satisfies the aberration formula\np\n\n\u03bc \u2261 cos \u03b8 =\n\n\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc0\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nThis latter relation identifies a suitable change of variables\nfor the angle integration, for which d\u03bc = d\u03bc0 /[\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc0 )]2 .\nOther transformation identities include \u03c9 sin \u03b8 = \u03c90 sin \u03b80 and\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )/(En \u2212 p\u03bc)2 = (1 \u2212 \u03bc20 )/\u03b52n , from which the invariance\nin form of \u03be is established via the definition in Eq. (7). It then\nfollows, after a modicum of algebra, that this pure change of\nvariables leads to an alternative form for the rate in Eq. (2):\n\u0393n0 =\n\nbeing the n\u2032 \u2192 0 specialization of the definition in Eq. (11b) of\nLatal (1986). The angle integration in Eq. (2) for the cyclotron\nrate is non-trivial, due largely to the complicated dependence of\n\u03be on \u03bc , and the presence of the exponential.\nThis completes the definitions relevant to Eq. (2). However,\nwe also note that the identities in Eq. (6) combine to yield\n\u03ba \u2261\n\nWhen weighted by \u03c9 top and bottom, this is a ratio of invariant\nproducts of four-momenta associated with the interaction; i.e.\n\u03be is also a Lorentz invariant for boosts along the field, which\ncan be inferred directly from Eq. (8).\n\n(5)\n\nfor \u03bc = cos \u03b8 . Here \u03c9 is the dimensionless photon energy, having been scaled by me c2 . The elimination of q from the system\nin Eq. (5) leads to the identities\n\u03c9\n\nwhich is precisely the argument of the exponential in Eq. (2).\nThis exp(\u2212\u03ba) factor results from the n\u2032 = 0 specialization\nof associated Laguerre functions that are formed from the spatial integration (Fourier transform) of the eigenfunctions. Since\n\u03c9 sin \u03b8 is Lorentz invariant under boosts along B, so also is \u03ba .\nFurthermore, forming En \u2212 p\u03bc using Eq. (5), and then eliminating \u03c9 using the second identity in Eq. (6), quickly leads to\nthe equivalence\nE \u2212 q\u03bc\n\u03be = 0\n.\n(9)\nEn \u2212 p\u03bc\n\n\u03b1f c\nnn\nB\nI (B)\n\u03bb\n\u2013 (n \u2212 1)! \u03b3 \u03b5n n\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwith\nIn (B) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\u2212\u03be\nd\u03bc0 (1 \u2212 \u03be)n\u22121 2 1\nexp \u2212n\n, (14)\n\u03b5 \u2212\n1+\u03be\n\u03b52n (1 + \u03be)n+1 n \u03be\n\nwhere, now \u03be is obtained from Eq. (7) using the correspondences \u03bc \u2192 \u03bc0 , p \u2192 0 and En \u2192 \u03b5n .\nAccordingly, this identifies attractive Lorentz transformation\nbehavior, with the rate reduced (i.e. lifetime dilated) by just\nthe Lorentz factor \u03b3 of the boost. Moreover, such boosts along\nthe field keep the spin states \"separated,\" i.e. there is no implied mixing of states incurred by such transformations. This\n\n\f4\ninherent simplicity is an appealing characteristic of the Sokolov\n& Ternov states, and was identified by Graziani (1993); it is\nnot exhibited in the Johnson & Lippman formalism explored\nin Sec. 3. Clearly, this extraction of p > 0 cases via a simple modification factor outside the integral is expedient for the\nsubsequent analytic developments.\n\nThese special functions are finite sums of elementary logarithmic and polynomial functions of zn (e.g. see Abramowitz &\nStegun 1965). Note that the Q\u03bd (z) are generalizable to associated Legendre functions Q\u03bc\u03bd (z) , defined in 8.703 of Gradshteyn\n& Ryzhik (1980), from which Q\u03bd (z) \u2261 Q0\u03bd (z) .

The integration variable\n\u03bc0 for In (B) in Eq (14) is not the most convenient; a more\nexpedient choice for the purposes of analytic reduction is\ns\n1 + 2nB \u03bc20\n\u03ba\n1\u2212\u03be\n\u03c6 \u2261\n=\n, \u03be =\n.\n(15)\nn\n1+\u03be\n1 + 2nB\nThe integration is even in \u03bc0 , and since 1/\u03b5n \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1 , the\nintegration range maps over to\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c6n \u2261\n\n\u03b5n \u2212 1\n\u03b5n + 1\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nAfter a modest amount of algebra, the change of variables then\nleads to the form\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013#\nZ \u03c6n\n\u2212n\u03c6 n\u22121\n1\nd\u03c6\ne\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\np\n\u03c6 +\n.\nIn (B) =\n1\u2212\n2 n \u03c6n\n(\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6) (1/\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6)\n0\n(17)\nThis integral can be evaluated in terms of Appell functions,\nthe degenerate, two-dimensional hypergeometric functions, using Eq. 3.385 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980). Such a step does\nnot facilitate evaluation, since Appell function expositions usually develop double, infinite power series representations (e.g.\nsee Burchnall & Chaundy 1941; Exton 1976).\nAnalytic progress is quickly made via Taylor series expansion\nof the exponential e\u2212n\u03c6 around \u03c6 = 0 . The order of integration and the infinite summation can then be interchanged\nbecause the integration is uniformly convergent on the interval\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c6n , since \u03c6n is strictly less than unity. Another change\nof variables \u03c6 = e\u2212t , with the definition\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nzn = cosh tn =\n\u03c6 +\n\u2261 1+\n,\n(18)\n2 n \u03c6n\nnB\n\n(22)\n\nand relevant properties of the Q\u03bd and J\u03bd functions are listed in\nthe Appendix. Computational issues for the Jm are discussed\nthere also, and an expedient approach for integer m = n + k is\nto compute the Jm using the recurrence relation in Eq.

For low values\nof n , this series is rapidly convergent for all zn \u2265 1 , typically requiring 3\u20134 terms to achieve 0.01% accuracy. Such a\nrate of convergence renders the series evaluation computationally much more efficient than a numerical integration of Eq. (2)\nby Simpson's rule or a quadrature technique. The appearance of\nthe Legendre functions of the second kind, Q\u03bd (z) , in the series\nexpansion for the rate is a result of the cylindrical symmetry\nimposed by the presence of the external magnetic field.\n\nthen establishes\nIn (B) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212n)k\n\nk=0\n\nk!\n\nJn+k (zn )\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwith\n1\nJ\u03bd (zn ) = \u221a\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ntn\n\nh\ni\n\u2212(\u03bd\u22121/2)t\np dt e\n1 \u2212 e\u2212t cosh tn .

The rates are scaled by the typical lifetime \u03c40 = \u03b1f c/\u03bb\n\u2013 , and are\nplotted as functions of the magnetic field strength B , expressed in units of\nBcr = 4.413\u00d71013 Gauss. The dotted lines represent the power-law asymptotic dependences (i) in the limit nB \u226a 1 in Eq. (26), for n = 3 , and (ii)\nin the nB \u226b 1 limit in Eq. (28), specifically for n = 30 . The dashed\ncurve is the logarithm of the ratio of spin-dependent rates for n = 1 in the\nSokolov & Ternov formalism, i.e., Eq. (24). Results are presented for zero\nelectron momentum initially along B, i.e., p = 0 or \u03b3 = 1 .\n\n\f5\nEvaluations of Eq. (23) are presented in Fig. 1 for different\nvalues of n and for \u03b3 = 1 , demonstrating the well-known rapid\nincrease of the rate with B when B <\n\u223c 1 . The dependence\non B is relatively weak for supercritical fields. The Figure also\nclearly exhibits the property d\u0393n0 /dn < 0 , which can, with\nextensive effort, be deduced from the integral form for the spinaveraged rate in Eq. (13). This decline of \u0393n0 with increasing\nn is evident in the asymptotic approximations for nB \u226a 1 and\nnB \u226b 1 derived shortly.

This curve illustrates how the rate is approximately independent of initial spin when nB \u226b 1 , whereas\n\u03b6 = \u22121 initial states lead to much faster transition rates (by of\norder (nB)\u22121 ) when nB \u226a 1 , reflecting the well-known dominance of non-spin-flip cyclotron transitions by non-relativistic\nelectrons (e.g. see Melrose & Zheleznyakov 1981).\n2.2.1. Asymptotic Limits\nNow consider the two pertinent asymptotic limits for the spinaveraged rate in Eq. (23). When nB \u226a 1 , \u03c6n \u2248 nB/2 \u226a 1\nand zn \u226b 1 . Using the first identity in Eq. (A1), Eq. 8.771.2 of\nGradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980) can then be invoked to obtain the\nleading order dependence of Jn (zn ) , noting the specialization\n2 F1 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, 0) = 1 of the common hypergeometric function.\nThe result, for general arguments z , is\nJn (z) \u2248\n\n(n + 1) \u0393(n) \u0393(1/2)\n(2z)\u2212n\n2 \u0393(n + 3/2)\n\n,\n\nz \u226b 1\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nHere, \u0393(x) represents the Gamma function. This is the leading order ( k = 0 ) term in the series evaluation of In (B) , and\nhence this result is readily checked by taking the \u03c6n \u2192 0 limit\nof Eq. (17). The doubling formula for the Gamma function, in\nEq. 8.335.1 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980), can now be used to\nyield an asymptotic form\n\u0393n0 \u2248\n\n\u03b1f c\n(n + 1)! n+1\n(2n2 )n\nB\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n(2n + 1)!\n\n,\n\nnB \u226a 1\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhich is just Eq. (31d) of Latal (1986). This form illustrates\nthe strong dependence of the cyclotron rates on both n and B .\nA sample n = 3 case of the limit in Eq. (26) is displayed in\nFig. 1. This limit can only be compared with the well-studied\nclassical cyclotron limit in a restricted fashion, since it is still\nan essentially quantum result. Moreover, it incorporates the intrinsically relativistic effect of spin-orbit coupling. Observe that\nEq. (26), in conjunction with Eq. (1), reproduces both the nonspin-flip ( \u03b6 = \u22121 ) and spin-flip ( \u03b6 = 1 ) ST rates encapsulated\nin Eqs. (18) and (21), respectively, of Melrose & Russell (2002),\nor equivalently, the n\u2032 = 0 specialization of Eq. (18) of Herold,\nRuder & Wunner (1982).\nClassical formulations of cyclotron emissivities (e.g. see\nEq. (6.19) of Bekefi 1966) yield rates that depend on components \u03b2\u22a5 c of the electron velocity perpendicular to the field:\n2n\n\u0393n \u221d B\u03b2\u22a5\n. Here the classical rate\n\u0393n effectively represents the nB \u226a 1 limit of a sum over\nvarious n \u2192 n\u2032 transitions, with n\u2032 < n . By invoking the\n2\ncorrespondence 2nB \u2192 p2\u22a5 = \u03b2\u22a5\n, it is quickly established\nthat \u0393n \u221d B n+1 , the same dependence as in Eq. (26). Yet\nin general, the classical \u0393n does not equal the quantum \u0393n0 ,\n\nsince here n\u2032 > 0 contributions are omitted from consideration. However, in the particular case of n = 1 , there is only\na single n\u2032 < n final state, namely n\u2032 = 0 , and with the pre2\nscription \u03b2\u22a5\n\u2192 2B , Eq. (6.19) of Bekefi (1966) specializes to\nyield \u03931 = 4\u03b1f c B 2 /(3\u03bb\n\u2013) , which is precisely the value obtained\nin Eq. (26). Derivation of the nB \u226b 1 , ultra-quantum limit is\nslightly more involved. In this situation, \u03c6n \u2192 1 and zn \u2192 1\nso that the entire k series in Eq. (23) is retained. The key useful\nresult is derived in the Appendix, in Eq. (A5), which establishes\nJn+k (z) \u2192 1/(n + k) as z \u2192 1+ . Including the next order logarithmic contribution then leads to an approximate form for\nIn (B) in Eq. (A6), so that it then follows that\n\u0393n0\n\n\u03b1c\n\u2248 f\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n\nr\n\nB\n2n\n\n(\n\n\u03b3(n, n) nn e\u2212n loge 2nB\n\u2212\n\u0393(n)\n\u0393(n)\n2nB\n\n)\n\n, nB \u226b 1 .\n\n(27)\nHere, \u03b3(n, x) is the incomplete Gamma function in 8.350.1 of\nGradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980). Note that the same result can\nbe derived directly from the \u03c6n \u2192 1 limit of Eq. (17) using\nthe integral\ndefinition of the incomplete Gamma function. The\n\u221a\nweak B dependence of the rate on B in this limit is now\napparent, and is evinced in Fig. 1 by the crowding of curves for\nsupercritical fields. In the limit of n \u226b 1 , further specialization is possible using the limit \u03b3(n, n)/\u0393(n) \u2192 1/2 as n \u2192 \u221e ,\nderived in the Appendix, to yield the approximation\n\u0393n0\n\n\u03b1c\n\u2248 f\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n\nr\n\nB\n8n\n\n,\n\nn \u226b 1 , B \u226b 1 .\n\n(28)\n\nThis ultra-quantum result corresponds to the limit given in\nEq. (32a) of Latal (1986), though the numerical\ncoefficient of\n\u221a\nLatal's does not agree exactly with the 1/ 8 factor in Eq. (28),\nthe difference being around 10%. However, the expressions for\nn \u2192 0 quantum cyclotron transition rates derived in Eq. (9) of\nSokolov, Zhukovskii & Nikitina (1973) and Eq. (2.56) of White\n(1974) reduce exactly to Eq. (28) in the limit B \u226b 1 , confirming\nthe asymptotic analysis here. A sample n = 30 case of this limit\nis displayed in Fig. 1, the precision of which is around 2% relative\nto the exact result, and better than Eq. (32a) of Latal (1986).\nThe first order correction to this asymptotic limit that would\n\u221a\nfollow from the logarithmic term in Eq. (27) is O(loge n/ n)\nrelative to the leading order contribution in Eq. (28).\n2.2.2. Differential Photon Spectra\nIn the p = 0 frame, the spin-averaged differential cyclotron\nrates d\u0393n0 /d\u03bc0 can be immediately extracted from Eq. (13)\nusing the prescription implied by Eq. (4). However, given\nthat Eqs. (6) and (7) define a one-to-one correspondence between the angle cosine \u03bc0 and the energy \u03c9 of the emitted\ncyclotron photon, the differential rates can suitably be presented as differential photon spectra, d\u0393n0 /d\u03c9 . The photon\nenergy is \u03c9 = (\u03b5n \u2212 1/\u03b5n)/(1 + \u03be) , so that the kinematic bound\n1/\u03b5n \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1 translates to\n\u221a nB\n\u2261 \u03c9\u2212 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c9+ \u2261\n1 + 2nB\n\n\u221a\n1 + 2nB \u2212 1\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\nThe change of variables is then defined by two branches,\n\u03bc0 = \u00b1\n\n1p\n(\u03b5n \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c9)(\u03b5n + 1 \u2212 \u03c9) ,\n\u03c9\n\n(30)\n\n\f6\nwith the factors inside the square root reflecting the kinematics associated with both the cyclotron radiation and the\none-photon pair creation interactions. This has a Jacobian\nd\u03bc0 /d\u03c9 = \u2212\u03be(1 + \u03be)\u03b52n /[(\u03b52n \u2212 1)\u03bc0 \u03c9] , leading to the spinaveraged differential spectrum\nd\u0393n0\nd\u03c9\n\n=\n\u00d7\n\n\u03b1f c 1 nn\u22121 en\n\u03bb\n\u2013 B \u03b52n \u0393(n + 1)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c9\n\u22121\n\u03c9\u2212\n\n\u0011n\u22121\n\n\u0011 (31)\n\u0010\n\u03c9\np (\u03b5n \u2212 \u03c9)nB \u2212 \u03c9\n.\nexp \u2212n\n\u03c9\u2212\n(\u03b5n \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c9)(\u03b5n + 1 \u2212 \u03c9)\n\nThis spectral rate is summed over the polarizations of the radiated photons. Note that a factor of 2 has been included to\naccount for the two branches of the relation between \u03bc0 and\n\u03c9 . Observe also that this spectrum can be obtained directly\nfrom Eq. (13) and the form for In (B) in Eq. (17) by using the\ncorrespondence \u03c6 = \u03c9/\u03c9\u2212 \u2212 1 .\nKey characteristics of the differential spectrum include its\nbroadening and shifting to higher energies as nB increases,\nbehavior that is largely governed by the kinematic result in\nEq. (29). An exponential decline is present in n = 1 cases until\na sharp kinematic peaking at \u03c9 \u223c \u03c9+ = \u03b5n \u2212 1 overtakes it.\nIn n \u226b 1 cases, this exponential contribution is dominated by\nthe power-law factor (\u03c9/\u03c9\u2212 \u2212 1)n\u22121 , leading to a steeply-rising\nspectrum. When nB \u226b 1 , nearly all of the\n\u221a radiative power in\nthe spectrum is confined to energies \u03c9 \u2248 2nB . In the opposite domain, nB \u226a 1 , the spectra are extremely narrow, and\nlittle insight is gained by attempting an involved comparison\nwith the classical limit; most classical results are rendered for\nsums over a multitude of transitions n \u2192 n\u2032 .\n2.2.3. Cyclotron Power\nTo conclude the formalism based on Sokolov & Ternov states,\nexpressions for the cyclotron energy loss rate, or power, Pn0 =\ndEn0 /dt can be expeditiously presented. The development of\nsuch rates parallels that for \u0393n0 , with the inclusion of an extra\n(dimensionless) weighting factor \u03c9 to the differential decay rate\nd\u0393n0 /d\u03bc . Hence, one can quickly write down\nP n0\n\n\u2261 me c2\n\n1\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u0393n0\nd\u03bc\nd\u03bc\n\nZ 1\nnn\nB\n\u03c9 d\u03bc\n\u03b1f me c\n(32)\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n(n \u2212 1)!

(2). This can be conveniently transformed to the integration variable \u03bc0 , representing\nthe p = 0 frame, using an analysis similar to that presented\nin Sec. 2.1. The only change is the manipulation of the additional \u03c9 = 2nB/(1 + \u03be)/(En \u2212 p\u03bc) factor inside the integration, for which the Lorentz transformation relations in Eqs. (11)\nand (12) quickly yield 1/(En \u2212 p\u03bc) = \u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc0 )/\u03b5n . Since\nd\u0393n0 /d\u03bc0 is even in \u03bc0 , it follows that the term proportional\nto \u03bc0 d\u0393n0 /d\u03bc0 in the transformed integrand of Eq. (32) does\nnot contribute. Therefore, comparison with Eqs. (13) and (14)\nthen indicates that\nP n0 =\n\n\u03b1f me c3 nn+1 B 2\nK (B)\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n(n \u2212 1)! \u03b52n n\n\n,\n\n(33)\n\nis the form for the cyclotron power for general p \u2265 0 , with\n1\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\u03bc0 (1 \u2212 \u03be)n\u22121 2 1\n1\u2212\u03be\nKn (B) = 2\nexp \u2212n\n,\n2\nn+2 \u03b5n \u2212 \u03be\n1+\u03be\n\u22121 \u03b5n (1 + \u03be)\n(34)\nwhere \u03be is given by Eq. (15). This expression for the power\nis identical to that in Eq. (28) of Latal (1986), who illustrated\nthe magnetic field and n dependence in his Fig. 1. The spin\u03b6\ndependent powers Pn0\nare, of course, just given by additional\n\u03b6\nmultiplicative factors: Pn0\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b6/\u03b5n )P n0 for \u03b6 = \u00b11 .\nObserve that the \u03b3 dependence has now disappeared from the\nanalysis, highlighting the fact that P n0 is a Lorentz invariant\nfor boosts along B. This follows from the exact compensation\nof time dilation and photon redshifting effects when integrating\nover all angles; such an attractive invariance property for the total power clearly does not extend to its differential counterpart\ndP n0 /d\u03bc .\nThe integral for Kn (B) can be manipulated in similar fashion to that for In (B) . Since the only difference is an extra\n2/(1 + \u03be) factor, which translates to a (1 + \u03c6) factor in the\nlight of Eq. (15), it follows that Kn (B) can be worked into\nthe form of Eq. (17), but with the extra (1 + \u03c6) factor. The\nsubsequent developments in Sec. 2.2 rapidly lead to the identity\nZ\n\nKn (B)\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nn\no\nX\n(\u2212n)k\nJn+k (zn ) + Jn+k+1 (zn )\nk!\n\nk=0\n\n\u2261\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\nk\n(\u2212n)k\n1\u2212\nJ\n(z ) ,\nk!\nn n+k n\n\n(35)\n\nk=0\n\nfor insertion into Eq. (33). Given this form, asymptotic limits can be routinely obtained by replicating the approaches\nof Sec. 2.2.1. When nB \u226a 1 , it is evident that Kn (B) \u2248\nIn (B) , since then Jn+1 (zn ) \u226a Jn (zn ) , as can be inferred for\nzn \u226b 1 from Eq. (25). Furthermore, for nB \u226b 1 , the result in Eq. (A5) quickly yields a leading order contribution\nKn (B) \u2248 \u03b3(n, n)/nn + \u03b3(n + 1, n)/nn+1 . Then the identity\n\u03b3(n + 1, n) = n \u03b3(n, n) \u2212 nn e\u2212n and Eq. (A8) can be used to\nderive the limiting form as n \u2192 \u221e . The results are\n\uf8f1\n(n + 1)! n+2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 2n n2n+1\nB\n, nB \u226a 1 ,\n\u03b1f me c3\n(2n + 1)!\nP n0 \u2248\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3B ,\nn, B \u226b 1 .\n2\n(36)\nWhile the nB \u226a 1 case here replicates that inferred from\nEq. (31) of Latal (1986), the nB \u226b 1 result differs from the\nnumerical result in Eq. (32a) of Latal (1986) by around 10%.\nThe mean cyclotron photon energy h\u03c9i is just the ratio of\nP n0 to \u0393n0 , so that one quickly deduces from a comparison\nof Eq. (36) with Eqs. (26) and (28) that h\u03c9i \u2248 nB when\nnB \u226a \u221a\n1 , as expected from classical cyclotron theory, and that\nh\u03c9i\n\u2248\n2nB when nB \u226b 1 . Note that Latal (1986) misses the\n\u221a\n2 factor (see his Eq. (32b) for the nB \u226b 1 domain) due to the\nimprecise nature of his estimates of the pertinent numerical factors in P n0 and \u0393n0 . These behaviors of h\u03c9i are reflected by\nthe differential spectral form in Eq. (31), where for nB \u226a 1 the\nspectrum is essentially a delta function pinned at the cyclotron\nharmonic energy nB , and where for n \u226b 1 and B \u226b 1 the\nspectrum is somewhat broad\u221abut markedly asymmetric, skewed\nstrongly towards \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9+ \u2248 2nB .\n\n\f7\n3. THE JOHNSON AND LIPPMANN FORMULATION\n\nA complementary formulation of the cyclotron problem was\nprovided by Daugherty & Ventura (1978, hereafter DV78) using wavefunctions derived by Johnson & Lippmann (1949). This\nis essentially the foremost presentation in the literature of cyclotron radiation calculations that specifically uses the Johnson & Lippmann eigenstates, hereafter referred to as JL states.\nThese states are eigenvalues simultaneously of the Dirac Hamil~ , where\ntonian and the kinetic momentum operator ~\u03c0 = p~+eA/c\n~ is the vector potential, and therefore are not eigenstates of\nA\nany physically meaningful spin operator (see Melrose & Parle\n1983). The relative lack of symmetry in the JL states between\nthe electron and positron wavefunctions leads to more complicated Lorentz transformation characteristics for the cyclotron\nrates for boosts along the magnetic field, as shall become evident below. The spin-averaged rate should (and does), of course,\nreduce to the Sokolov & Ternov formalism result in Eq. (2).\n3.1. Reduction to a Latal-Type Form\nFor direct comparison with the Sokolov & Ternov formalism\nresults above, it is necessary to generalize the cyclotron emission\nresults in the Appendix of DV78 to treat arbitrary n \u2192 0 transitions, specifically their Eqs. (A2) and (A3). This is a routine\nS-matrix calculation in quantum electrodynamics, and essentially parallels the cyclotron absorption calculations presented\nin Sec. II of DV78. The reader is therefore referred to DV78 for\nrelevant background and some definitional material, and here\nonly a detailed outline of the derivation is provided. Wherever\npossible, the same notation as used in the ST formulation above\nis adopted. The starting point is Eq. (A1) of DV78, which can\nbe integrated over photon solid angles d\u03a9 = 2\u03c0 d(cos \u03b8) to yield\nthe spin-dependent cyclotron rate\nZ\n\u03b1f c X\ndn\n\u03b6\n\u0393n0 = 2\u03c0\n\u03a6\n,\n(37)\nd(cos \u03b8) d\u03c9\n\u03bb\n\u2013\nd\u03c9 \u03c3\n\u03c3=\u22a5, k\n\nwhere dn/d\u03c9 = 4\u03c0L3 \u03c9 2 /(2\u03c0\u03bb\n\u2013)3 is the density of photon states\nin a box of size L ; this size establishes the normalization of the\nwavefunctions. Note that dn/d\u03c9 is dimensionless because of\nthe adopted convention of dimensionless photon energies \u03c9 .\nA sum over the \u03c3 =\u22a5, k photon polarization states has been\neffected, with the standard convention for the labelling of the\nphoton polarizations being adopted: k refers to the state with\nthe photon's electric field vector parallel to the plane containing\nthe magnetic field and the photon's momentum vector, while \u22a5\ndenotes the photon's electric field vector being normal to this\nplane.

Expressions\nfor these spatial parts of the Johnson & Lippmann eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation are given Eq. (10) of DV78; these\ndo not exhibit the same charge conjugation symmetry that the\nSokolov & Ternov \"transverse polarization\" states do.\nIn Eq. (40), M\u03c3 is one of the two \"polarization matrices\" in\nEq. (15) of DV78, representing contracted products of polariza(\u03b6)\ntion vectors and the Dirac \u03b3 matrices. Since the un and u\u20200\nfunctions possess the dimensions of (length)\u22123/2 , it follows that\nVf i and consequently Sf i and \u03a6\u03c3 are dimensionless. Observe\nalso that the temporal integration over the wavefunction products has already been performed leading to the \u03b4 function in\nEq. (39) that expresses energy conservation. Finally, note that\na defines the mean location of the initial electron wavefunction\nperpendicular to B, i.e. is a counterpart to b .\nThe squaring of the matrix elements in Eq. (38) is performed\nusing the approach of, for example, Bjorken & Drell (1964) for\nhandling the \u03b4 function. The result is\n\u03a6\u03c3 \u2192\n\n\u03b1f 2\u03c0\u03bb\n\u20133 \u03b4(En \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c9)\nVf i\n2\u03c9 L3\nEn E0\n\n2\n\n(41)\n\nin parallel with the developments leading to Eq. (19) of DV78.\nIntegrations analogous to those in Eq. (40) have been performed\nanalytically in DV78 for the cyclotron absorption case, resulting in the appearance of associated Laguerre functions that are\ncharacteristic of magnetized QED calculations involving either\nfree electrons or electron propagators. Here, since specialization\nto the n\u2032 = 0 case is made, these functions reduce to simple\ncombinations of power-laws and exponentials, viz.,\n\u03a9n0\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\u03ban \u2212\u03ba\ne\nn!\n\n,\n\n\u03ba =\n\n\u03c9 2 sin2 \u03b8\n.\n2B\n\n(42)\n\nin the notation of Eq. (18) of DV78. As these spatial integrations embody translational invariance along the field, they yield\na \u03b4 function expressing conservation of momentum parallel to\nB, i.e. establishing p = q + \u03c9 cos \u03b8 , and completing the conservation laws in Eq. (5).\nA simple crossing symmetry manipulation of Eq. (16) of DV78\nfacilitates the evaluation of Eq. (40), and also Eq. (38), which\ncan be compared closely with Eq. (19) of DV78. Using the\nidentity in Eq. (42), and reverting to the \u03bc = cos \u03b8 notation,\na modest amount of algebra then yields relatively compact expressions for the spin-dependent cyclotron emission rate in the\nJohnson & Lippmann formalism:\nZ 1\n\u03b1f c\n(En \u2212 E0 ) e\u2212\u03ba \u03ban\u22121\n\u03b6\n\u0393n0 =\nd\u03bc\n4\u03bb\n\u2013 \u22121\nEn (E0 \u2212 q\u03bc) (n \u2212 1)!\n(43)\nn\no\n\u00d7 (En + 1) (E0 + 1) \u039b\u03b6k + \u039b\u03b6\u22a5\n.\n\n\f8\nThe different photon polarization and electron spin combinations yield the following contributions:\n\u0013\n\u001b2\n\u001a\u0012\n\u03c9(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\np\nq\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u039b+1\n=\nk\nE0 + 1 En + 1\nEn + 1\n(44)\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b2\nq\n\u03c9(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\np\n\u03bc\n\u22121\n\u039bk\n= 2nB\n+\n\u2212\nE0 + 1 En + 1\n2nB\nEn + 1\nfor the k polarization, and\n\u0012\n+1\n\u039b\u22a5 =\n\u039b\u22121\n\u22a5\n\n=\n\nq\np\n\u2212\nE0 + 1 En + 1\n\n\u00132\n\n(45)\n\n2nB\n(En + 1)2\n\nfor photons of \u22a5 polarization. It is now almost trivial to demonstrate that for the n = 1 case, Eq. (43) in concert with Eqs. (44)\nand (45) reduces to Eqs. (A2) and (A3) of Daugherty & Ventura\n(1978), when \u03b6 = +1 and \u03b6 = \u22121 , respectively. Accordingly,\nEqs. (43\u201345) serve as a generalization of the cyclotron emission\nrates presented in DV78 to arbitrary n \u2192 0 transitions.\nThe isolation of the photon polarization contributions in this\ndevelopment is an attribute that is absent from the exposition\nin the Appendix of Daugherty & Ventura (1978). Such an isolation expedites the algebraic developments that reduce this form\ninto expressions that much more closely resemble those in the\nSokolov & Ternov formulation, i.e. Eqs. (1) and (2). The analytic reduction is routine, but lengthy, involving the expedient\nuse of several identities. Among these are Eqs. (5\u20137), which can\nbe used to quickly derive\nEn \u03bc \u2212 p = E0 \u03bc \u2212 q\n\n,\n\n\u03be(En \u2212 p\u03bc) = E0 \u2212 q\u03bc\n\n,\n\nX \u2261\n\n(48)\n\nWith this assembly of tools, and various algebraic manipulations, one is lead to the following final forms for the spindependent cyclotron rates in the Johnson & Lippmann formulation:\nZ 1\n\u03b1f c\nnn\nB\ne\u2212\u03ba d\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03be)n\u22121\n\u03b6\n\u0393n0 =\nX ,\n\u03bb\n\u2013 (n \u2212 1)!

(1) and (2), as\nshould be the situation. Such degeneracy between formalisms\nalso prevails for the power P n0 radiated when averaged over\nthe initial electron spins.\nNote that while the spin-dependent rates are generally different for the two sets of wavefunctions, in the limit p \u2192 0 , it is\nclear from Eq. (50) that X\u03b6 \u2192 (1 \u2212 \u03b6/\u03b5n )X so that the two formalisms become degenerate in this limit. This is a consequence\nof the mathematical identity of the Sokolov & Ternov and Johnson & Lippmann eigenstates in the special case of p = 0 .\n3.2. Lorentz Boost Characteristics and Analytics\nAs with the analysis in Sec. 2, it is instructive to discern the\nLorentz transformation behavior of the Johnson & Lippmann\nrates. Such a development closely parallels that in Sec. 2.1,\nagain writing the relevant integrals in terms of variables in the\nframe in which p = 0 . With the identities En = \u03b3\u03b5n and\n1/(En \u2212 p\u03bc) = \u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc0 )/\u03b5n , it can be quickly established that\nX+1 =\n\n(46)\n\nthe latter of which is just a rearrangement of Eq.

As for the\ncyclotron power considerations of Sec. 2.2.3, since the spinaveraged integrand or d\u0393n0 /d\u03bc0 is even in \u03bc0 , the term proportional to \u03bc0 in Eq. (52) contributes exactly zero to the integral\nin Eq. (49). This simplification clearly also applies to X\u22121 . It\nthen follows that an alternative form for the rate in Eq. (49) is\n\u0393\u03b6n0\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b1f c\nnn\nB\n\u03b6(\u03b3 + \u03b5n )\n=\nIn (B) .\n1\u2212\n\u03bb\n\u2013 (n \u2212 1)! \u03b3\u03b5n\n\u03b5n (\u03b3\u03b5n + 1)\n\n(53)\n\nThis form conveniently avails itself of the analytic developments\nof Sec. 2.2, so that no further reduction of integrals is necessary:\nthe evaluation of In (B) as a series of Legendre functions of the\nsecond kind in Eq. (19) is immediately applicable. Such a simplification cannot be applied to the spin-dependent cyclotron\npowers, a point that is addressed below.\nThe Lorentz-transformed expression for the cyclotron rates in\nEq. (53) is attractively simple, but is not as elegant as its equivalent for the Sokolov & Ternov formulation, as embodied in\nEqs. (1) and (13). Here, boosts along the field do not introduce\nsimple time dilation factors of 1/\u03b3 , essentially amounting to a\nmixing of JL spin states induced by such transformations. This\nless than ideal characteristic is a consequence of the fact that\nthe JL wavefunctions are eigenstates of a somewhat convoluted\nspin operator that is not symmetric under charge conjugation\n(e.g., see Melrose & Parle 1983), nor is it manifestly covariant\nunder boosts along the field. In contrast, the ST \"transverse polarization\" wavefunctions are eigenstates of the component \u03bcz\n~\nalong B of the magnetic moment operator ~\u03bc = ~\u03c3 \u2212i~\u03b3 \u00d7{~\np +e A}\n\n\f9\n(here ~\u03c3 and ~\u03b3 are matrix vectors for the Dirac algebra), and\nsuch eigenstates exhibit both appropriate symmetry between\npositrons and electrons, and simple transformation properties\nfor boosts parallel to the field.\nThe sensitivity of the spin-dependent cyclotron rates, and in\nparticular their Lorentz transformation characteristics, to the\nchoice of spin eigenfunctions is naturally expected, since the\ninherently relativistic effect of spin-orbit coupling is explicitly\nincorporated in the Dirac equation in an external field, thereby\nemphasizing the interpretative importance of the choice of wavefunctions. The greater elegance of the results in Sec. 2 is yet\nanother argument in favor of usage of Sokolov & Ternov states\nfor the cyclotron problem, and therefore for other QED processes where spin-dependent cyclotron rates are required.\nNote that the differential spectrum for spin-dependent considerations can be routinely obtained in a manner similar to the\nderivation of Eq. (31), observing that X can be replaced by\nX+1 in Eq. (52), or X\u22121 = 2X \u2212 X+1 , as desired, and then\nusing the substitution \u03be = (\u03b5n \u2212 1/\u03b5n )/\u03c9 \u2212 1 .\n\n2\u03b3/(\u03b3 + 1) when \u03b6 = 1 , the maximum departure from unity in\nthis case. In the 2nB \u223c 1 domain,\nas \u03b3 \u221a\n\u2192 \u221e , for \u03b6 = \u22121 the\n\u221a\nminimum in the\nratio\nis\n(4\n+\n2\n2)/(4\n+\n3\n2) \u2248 0.83 and occurs\n\u221a\nfor nB = 1 + 2 .\nThe significant deviations from unity underline the importance of the choice of wavefunctions when retaining spin dependence. This becomes a profound issue for resonant Compton scattering problems (e.g. see Graziani 1993), where, as\ndiscussed above, the spin-dependent cyclotron lifetime is required to render the intermediate electron states metastable and\nthereby truncate the divergent resonance at the cyclotron frequency. It is also pertinent to handling resonances in magnetic\nCoulomb scattering (e.g. Langer 1981), two-photon pair creation in strong fields (e.g. Kozlenkov & Mitrofanov 1986), magnetic photon splitting above pair creation threshold (discussed\nbriefly in Baring 2000), and other general external field problems involving electrons either in free states or as propagators\n(Graziani, Harding & Sina, 1995).\nTo conclude this section, a brief exposition of the spindependent powers is offered. The spin-averaged power is, of\ncourse, that in Eq. (33). To retain spin dependence in the JL\nformalism, one proceeds by weighting the integrand of Eq. (49)\nwith a \u03c9 = 2nB/(1 + \u03be)/(En \u2212 p\u03bc) factor. Guided by the analysis in Sec. 2.2.3, terms that are odd in \u03bc0 contribute zero, and\nthe by now routine manipulations yield the form\n\u03b6\nPn0\n\n\u03b1f me c3 nn+1 B 2\n\u03bb\n\u2013\n(n \u2212 1)! \u03b52n\n(55)\n)\n(\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n3\n2\u03b3\u03b2 (nB)\n\u03b6(\u03b3 + \u03b5n )\nKn (B) + \u03b6 3\nLn (B) ,\n\u00d7\n1\u2212\n\u03b5n (\u03b3\u03b5n + 1)\n\u03b5n (\u03b3\u03b5n + 1)\n\n=\n\nwhere Kn (B) is the integral in Eq.

This ratio approaches unity for either \u03b3 \u2192 1\n(dotted line) or for 2nB \u226b 1 , and in the case of \u03b6 = \u22121 also\nfor 2nB \u226a 1 .

Furthermore,\naveraging Eq.

Note that\n\u03b6\nasymptotic limits of Pn0\nfor small and large nB can be readily\nobtained but are not particularly elucidating for the purposes\nof this exposition.\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper presents useful analytic developments of spindependent cyclotron decay rates/widths for general n \u2192 0 transitions between Landau states, expressing these in terms of various series of Legendre functions Qn (z) of the second kind. The\nrates and the radiated cyclotron powers are derived using two\npopular eigenstate formalisms appropriate for the Dirac equation in a uniform magnetic field, namely that due to Sokolov &\nTernov (1968), and that due to Johnson & Lippmann (1949).\nThe resulting expressions are Eq. (23) for the cyclotron rate and\nEq. (33) in conjunction with Eq. (35) for the Sokolov & Ternov\nformulation, and Eq. (53) for the rate and Eq. (55) for the power\n\n\f10\nfor the Johnson & Lippmann case. These compact forms can\nbe expediently used in astrophysical models, since they generally amount to rapidly convergent series of elementary functions.\nThese spin-dependent results are particularly important for addressing resonant cyclotronic divergences that appear in various\nhigher-order QED mechanisms in external magnetic fields. The\nJohnson & Lippmann developments extend the work of Daugherty & Ventura (1978) to arbitrary n \u2192 0 transitions, while\nthe series development permits a more accurate determination\nof nB \u226b 1 asymptotics of the Sokolov & Ternov rates than\nthat offered in Latal (1986).\nIn addition, the Lorentz transformation characteristics of the\nrates are derived for boosts along the magnetic field, yielding\na simple time dilation multiplicative factor in the ST case, but\na slightly more complicated and less ideal dependence on boost\nLorentz factor for the JL analysis, where spin-state mixing is\nimplied by such boosts. Such comparitive complexity of the\nJL formalism is more pronounced for the radiated power. This\n\ncomparison again underlines the superior attributes of Sokolov\n& Ternov eigenstates for use in evaluating rates and cross sections of magnetized processes in quantum electrodynamics.\n\nWe thank the referee, Carlo Graziani, for incisive comments\nthat were helpful to the polishing of the manuscript. We also\nthank Joe Daugherty for the provision of materials pertaining\nto the Johnson & Lippmann formalism, and PLG acknowledges\nthe assistance of Stefan Coltisor during the early stages of the\ndevelopment of the decay rates using the Johnson & Lippmann\nwavefunctions.

They can be defined in terms of\nhypergeometric functions (e.g. see Eq. 8.820.2 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik 1980), or alternatively the integral representation in Eq. (21).\nFor integer indices \u03bd = n , the specialization of interest here, they are simple combinations of logarithmic and polynomial functions\n(e.g. see Abramowitz & Stegun 1965), that lead to similar simplicity for the J\u03bd (z) using Eq. (22). Observe that Q\u03bd (z) \u2261 Q0\u03bd (z) ,\nwhere the associated Legendre functions Q\u03bc\u03bd (z) are defined in 8.703 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980). Note also the alternative\nidentities\nZ \u221e\np\n\u22121\n2\nJ\u03bd (z) = \u2212(\u03bd + 1) z \u2212 1 Q\u03bd (z) = (\u03bd + 1)\nQ\u03bd (t) dt , z > 1 ,\n(A1)\nz\n\nembodied in the results 8.734.3 and 8.752.5 in Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980). Explicit functional forms for some of the Qn (z) are\ngiven in Abramowitz & Stegun (1965) and Eq. 8.827 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980), from which the following identities for the\nfirst few Jn (z) can be formed:\nJ1 (z) = z \u2212\n\nz2 \u2212 1\nz+1\nlog\n2\nz\u22121\n\nJ2 (z) = \u22121 +\nJ3 (z) = \u2212\n\n,\n\nz+1\n3z 2 3z (z 2 \u2212 1)\n\u2212\nlog\n2\n4\nz\u22121\n\n,\n\n13z 5z 3 (5z 2 \u2212 1) (z 2 \u2212 1)\nz+1\n+\n\u2212\nlog\n6\n2\n4\nz\u22121\n\n(A2)\n.\n\nAn effective way to derive expressions for the Jn (z) in terms of elementary functions, at least for low n , is to use the Rodrigues\nformula in 8.836.1 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980), and then invoke Eq. (22). An alternative approach is to use identities 8.831.2\nand 8.831.3 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980), to arrive at a relation between Qn (z) and a sum of Legendre polynomials Ps (z) and\na logarithmic term. This quickly yields\nJn (z) =\n=\n\nQn\u22121 (z) \u2212 z Qn (z)\nn\nn\u22121\nh\ni\nX\nX1\nz+1\n1\n1\nPn\u22121 (z) \u2212 z Pn (z) log\nPk\u22121 (z) Pn\u22121\u2212k (z) + z\nP\n(z) Pn\u2212k (z) ,\n\u2212\n2\nz\u22121\nk\nk k\u22121\nk=1\n\n(A3)\n\nk=1\n\na form that clearly displays the combined logarithmic and polynomial character of these functions, and which is useful for asymptotic\nresults, explored just below.\nThere are various possible approaches to numerical calculations of the Jn functions for integer indices. Options include direct use\nof Eq. (A3), combined with an efficient algorithm for computing the Legendre polynomials for arguments z > 1 , such as invoking\nrecurrence relations (e.g. see Eq. 8.5.3 of Abramowitz & Stegun 1965), which are numerically accurate for upward recurrence in\nthe polynomial index n . Alternatively, direct recurrence of the Qn (z) functions, which satisfy the same relations as the Pn (z) ,\nis viable, though this is only stable for downward iterations in n when z > 1 . This approach therefore requires evaluation of\nthe Pn (z) for two particular initial values n , perhaps via the hypergeometric function series using the identity in Eq. 8.1.5 of\n\n\f11\nAbramowitz & Stegun (1965). However, probably the most expedient numerical technique is to use the recurrence relation for the\nJn (z) functions directly:\nn(n + 1) Jn+1 (z) \u2212 n(2n + 1) z Jn (z) + (n2 \u2212 1) Jn\u22121 (z) = 0 .\n(A4)\n\nThis identity can be deduced after a modicum of algebra from Eq. 8.5.3 of Abramowitz & Stegun (1965). Note that strong\ncancellation often arises between the last two terms of this equation, so that for large n and z > 1 , the values of Jn (z) decline\nexponentially with n according to Eq. (25). Starting with initial values prescribed by Eq. (A2), this technique is stable to upward\nrecurrence in n for any z > 1 , the range of arguments appropriate for the cyclotron problem. This quickly yields suitably precise\nvalues (numerically tested for n \u2264 100 ) for a range of indices required in the series summations that appear in the cyclotron rates\nand powers, for example in Eqs. (23) and (35). The use of this recurrence becomes superfluous typically for n > 30 , since such\nindices are generally required only in the classical cyclotron limit when zn \u226b 1 , and the asymptotic limit in Eq. (25) is then the\npreferred computational tool.\nNow focusing on asymptotics issues, two limiting values of Jn (z) are required for the analysis in Sec. 2.2. The z \u226b 1 limit is\nroutinely derived, and is listed in Eq. (25). Since z \u2265 1 , the other limiting domain is z \u2192 1 . This is a somewhat more involved\ncase. By inspection of Eq. (A3), as z \u2192 1 , the logarithmic terms approach zero since Pn (z) \u2192 1 + n(n + 1)(z \u2212 1)/2 + O(z \u2212 1)2 .\nThe Legendre polynomials thus simplify to approximately unity, to leading order, and it follows that in the neighborhood of z = 1 ,\nJn (z) =\n\n1\nn+1\n2\n\u2212\n(z \u2212 1) log\n+ O(z \u2212 1)\nn\n2\nz\u22121\n\n(A5)\n\ndefines the leading order terms to the Taylor series expansion. Insertion in Eq. (19) then yields\nIn (B) \u2248\n\n\u001a\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212n)k\n\nk=0\n\nk!\n\n1\nn+k+1\n2\n\u2212\n(zn \u2212 1) log\nn+k\n2\nzn \u2212 1\n\n\u001b\n\n=\n\n(z \u2212 1)\n2\n\u03b3(n, n)\n\u2212 e\u2212n n\nlog\nnn\n2\nzn \u2212 1\n\n,\n\n(A6)\n\ncorrect to order O([z \u2212 1] log |z \u2212 1| ) . Here, \u03b3(n, x) is the incomplete Gamma function, and can be introduced using the series\nidentity 8.354.1 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980).\nAnother identity required for the development of Eq. (28) pertains to the evaluation of \u03b3(n, n) for large n . For low values of\nn , say n <\n\u223c 20 , one can use 8.352.1 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980), namely\nn\n\nX nk\n\u03b3(n, n)\n\u0393(n, n)\n\u2261 1\u2212\n= 1 \u2212 e\u2212n\n\u0393(n)\n\u0393(n)\nk!\n\n,\n\n(A7)\n\nk=0\n\nas an efficient series evaluation for either the \u03b3(n, n) or \u0393(n, n) incomplete Gamma functions. For larger\nn , one can appeal to\n\u221a\n\u2212n n\u22121/2\n2\u03c0\nand\nidentity 6.5.25 of\nthe identity \u0393(n + 1, n) = n \u0393(n, n) + nn e\u2212n , together with\nStirling's\nexpansion\n\u0393(n)\n\u2248\ne\nn\np\nAbramowitz & Stegun (1965), namely \u0393(n + 1, n) \u2248 e\u2212n nn n\u03c0/2 , to establish the results\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03b3(n, n)\n1\n\u0393(n, n)\n=\n= lim\n\u0393(n)\n2\nn\u2192\u221e \u0393(n)\n\n.\n\n(A8)\n\n\u221a\nRetaining the next order contributions to \u03b3(n, n) and \u0393(n, n) then yields corrections of approximately \u00b11/(3 2n\u03c0 ) to the two\nratios in Eq. (A8).\nREFERENCES\nAbramowitz, M. & Stegun, I. A. 1965, Handbook of Mathematical\nFunctions, (Dover, New York).\nBaring, M. G. 2000, Phys. Rev.
