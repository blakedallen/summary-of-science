Initially proposed as an abstract physical model for the understanding of a micromolecular\nmachinery [2], ratchet systems have found diverse applications in many areas [3, 4, 5], from mechanical devices [6] up to the quantum systems [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nAmong the areas with growing interest is the study of\nratchet dynamics for cold atoms [12]. Hamiltonian ratchets [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] with the corresponding symmetry\npredictions [13] have recently been successfully realized\nwith cold Rubidium and Cesium atoms in optical lattices\nwith a two-harmonics driving and a tunable weak dissipation [18]. In these experiments, the mechanism of the\nSisyphus cooling [19] has been used in order to furnish\ninitial conditions in form of an optical lattice: an ensemble of atoms localized in the wells of a periodic potential\ncreated by laser beams. In the momentum space this\ncorresponds to a narrow distribution near the momentum p = 0. This is essential for the observation of the\nrectification effect, since the asymptotic current tends to\nzero for broad initial distributions in momentum space.\nTo describe the ratchet dynamics of the thermal cloud\nof cold atoms in optical lattices [18], a classical model has\nbeen used [13, 14, 15]. However, as the cloud of atoms\nin a far detuned optical potential [20] is cooled further\ndown, one can obtain a system where quantum effects\nbecome relevant. Many studies of quantum ratchets are\nbased on the kicked rotor model [7, 16, 21, 22], which\nis readily treated numerically. In reality kicks may heat\nthe system and degrade quantum effects. It is perhaps\nfor that reason, that other successful experiments [18] use\na time continuous drive, which is also the choice in the\npresent work.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we\nintroduce the model for the quantum tilting ratchet and\n\ndiscuss its properties. The dynamics of the system is\nstudied within the Floquet theory. We use the Husimi\nrepresentation in order to link eigenstates to manifolds in\nthe classical phase space. In section III we study the relevant symmetries, whose violation leads to the directed\ncurrent, and the desymmetrization mechanisms. Section\nIV is devoted to the dynamics of current rectification.\nWe begin by discussing the dependence of the current on\nthe initial condition. Then we investigate the appearance and controlling of quantum resonances that lead to\na significant enhancement of directed transport. In Section V we introduce the realization of a quantum flashing\nratchet system. Finally, in Section VI we summarize our\nresults. Some of our important technical details are deferred to the Appendices A, B and C.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL SET-UP\n\nLet us start with a cloud of atoms, placed into a periodic potential (formed by an optical standing wave) and\nexposed to an external ac field. Assuming a low density,\nwe neglect the interactions among the atoms. Hence, our\nproblem can be described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\ni~\n\n\u2202\n|\u03c8(t)i = H(t, t0 )|\u03c8(t)i,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian H is of the form [18]\nH(x, p, t) =\n\np2\n+ (1 + cos(x)) \u2212 xE(t \u2212 t0 ).\n2\n\n(2)\n\nHere E(t) is an external periodic field of zero mean, E(t\u2212\nRT\nt0 + T ) = E(t \u2212 t0 ), 0 E(t)dt = 0, and t0 is the initial\ntime.\nThe Hamiltonian (2) is periodic in time with period T . The solutions |\u03c8\u03b1 (t)i = U (t, t0 )|\u03c8\u03b1 (0)i of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (1) can be characterized by the\n\n\f2\neigenfunctions of U (t0 + T, t0 ) which satisfy the Floquet\nE\u03b1\ntheorem: |\u03c8\u03b1 (t)i = e\u2212i T t |\u03c6\u03b1 (t)i, |\u03c6\u03b1 (t + T )i = |\u03c6\u03b1 (t)i.\nThe quasienergies E\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c0 < E\u03b1 < \u03c0) and the Floquet\neigenstates can be obtained as solutions of the eigenvalue\nproblem of the Floquet operator\nU (T, t0 )|\u03c6\u03b1 (t0 )i = e\u2212iE\u03b1 |\u03c6\u03b1 (t0 )i.\n\n(3)\n\nThe Floquet eigenstates provide a complete orthonormal basis and the stroboscopic quantum state can be\nexpressed as [23]\nX\n|\u03c8(mT, t0 )i =\n(4)\nC\u03b1 (t0 )e\u2212imE\u03b1 |\u03c6\u03b1 (t0 )i,\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the coefficients {C\u03b1 } depend on t0 . For later\nconvenience the integer \u03b1 = 0, 1, 2.., sorts the states\n|\u03c6\u03b1 i such, that the mean kinetic energy hp2 i\u03b1 \u2261\nRT\n1/T 0 h\u03c6\u03b1 |p\u03022 |\u03c6\u03b1 idt0 monotonically increases.\nBy using the gauge transformation, |\u03c8i\n\u2192\nRt\nexp(\u2212 ~i x 0 E(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 )|\u03c8i [24], we transform the original\nHamiltonian (2) into a spatially periodic one (see\nAppendix A). Then the solution of the time-dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for the new Hamiltonian may be\nwritten as\ni\n\n|\u03c8(t)i = e\u2212 ~\n\nRt\n0\n\n{ 12 [p\u0302\u2212A(t\u2032 ,t0 )]2 +(1+cos x)}dt\u2032\n\n|\u03c8(0)i,\n\n(5)\n\nRt\nwith the vector potential A(t) = \u2212 0 E(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 . Due to\ndiscrete translational invariance and Bloch's theorem all\nFloquet states are characterized by a quasimomentum \u03ba\nwith |\u03c6\u03b1 (x + 2\u03c0)i = ei~\u03ba |\u03c6\u03b1 (x)i.\nHere we choose \u03ba = 0 which corresponds to initial\nstates where atoms equally populate all (or many) wells\nof the spatial potential. The wave function is expanded\nin the plane wave eigenbasis of the momentum operator\np\u0302, |ni = \u221a12\u03c0 einx , viz.\n|\u03c8(t)i =\n\nN\nX\n\ncn (t)|ni.\n\n(6)\n\nn=\u2212N\n\nA detailed discussion of the two numerical procedures\nused to integrate Eq.(1) is presented in the Appendix B.\nTo examine the morphology of the quasienergy states\nwe use the Husimi representation [25]\n\u03c1(hxi, hpi) =\n\n1\n|h\u03c8|\u03a6hxi,hpi i|2 ,\n2\u03c0\n\nIII.\n\nRELEVANT SYMMETRIES AND THEIR\nVIOLATIONS\nA.\n\nClassical limit\n\nLet us briefly outline the classical case. In this limit the\nsystem is generically characterized by a nonintegrable dynamics with a mixed phase space containing both chaotic\nand regular areas in the three-dimensional phase space\n(x, p, t) [27]. Due to time and space periodicity of the\nclassical equation of motion \u1e8d = \u2212 \u2202H\n\u2202x , we can map\nthe original three-dimensional phase space onto a twodimensional cylinder, T2 = (x mod1, p), by using the stroboscopic Poincar\u00e9 section after each period T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9,\ncf. Fig.1(a). This provides a helpful visualization of the\nmixed phase space structure. A stochastic layer, located\nnear the line p = 0, originates from the destroyed separatrix of the undriven system, E(t) = 0. The chaotic layer\nis confined by transporting KAM \u2212 tori, which originate\nfrom perturbed trajectories of particles with large kinetic\nenergies, hp2 i. The stochastic layer is not uniform and\ncontains different regular invariant manifolds - regular\nislands, unstable periodic orbits and cantori [27].\nThere are two symmetries which need to be broken\nto fulfill the necessary conditions for the appearance of\na dc-current J = limt\u2192\u221e xt = h\u1e8bi [13]. If E(t) is shift\nsymmetric, i. e. E(t) = \u2212E(t + T /2), the symmetry\nSa : (x, p, t) \u2192 (\u2212x, \u2212p, t + T /2),\n\n(9)\n\nis realized. Furthermore, if E(t) is symmetric, i. e.\nE(t + ts ) = E(\u2212t + ts ) at some appropriate point ts ,\nthe symmetry\nSb : (x, p, t) \u2192 (x, \u2212p, \u2212t + 2ts ),\n\n(10)\n\nis holds. Any trajectory, when transformed using one of\nthe abovementioned symmetry operations, yields again\na trajectory of the system but with opposite velocity.\nAssuming that ergodicity holds in the stochastic layer\n(which means that all its average characteristics are independent on the initial conditions, and that symmetryrelated trajectories have the same statistical weight, we\nconclude that the asymptotic velocity within the chaotic\nlayer is zero. So, whenever Sa and/or Sb are realized,\ndirected transport is forbidden inside the chaotic layer\n[13].\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\u001a\n\u001b\n(hxi \u2212 x)2\n1\nexp \u2212\n\u03a6hxi,hpi (x) =\n+ ihpix\n4\u03c3 2\n(2\u03c0\u03c3 2 )1/4\n(8)\nwith \u03c3 = (~/2)1/2 . Here hxi and hpi stand for the average\nof the position and momentum respectively. The Husimi\nrepresentation provides an insightful, coarse grained description in the phase-space [25].\n\nThe two frequency driving,\nE(t, t0 ) = E1 cos[\u03c9(t \u2212 t0 )] + E2 cos[2\u03c9(t \u2212 t0 ) + \u03b8], (11)\nensures that for E1 , E2 6= 0 Sa is always violated. In\naddition Sb is violated for \u03b8 6= 0, \u00b1\u03c0.

The parameters are E1 = E2 = 2, \u03c9 = 2, \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2 and t0 = 0.\n\nto ergodicity inside the layer, the asymptotic current is\nindependent of the initial time t0 , for initial conditions\nlocated inside the chaotic layer. With the specific choice\nof the driving (11) it follows Jch (\u03b8) = \u2212Jch (\u2212\u03b8) and\nJch (\u03b8) = \u2212Jch (\u03b8 + \u03c0) [13]. From perturbation theory\nit follows Jch \u223c E12 E2 sin \u03b8 [13, 14]. An efficient sum\nrule allows to compute the average current Jch by proper\nintegration over the chaotic layer [16].\nB.\n\nQuantum case\n\nIf the Hamiltonian is invariant under the shift symmetry Sa (9), then the Floquet operator possesses the\nproperty, see Eq.(179) in Ref.[23]:\nT\n\nU (T, t0 ) = U z (T /2, t0) U (T /2, t0 ) .\n\n(12)\n\nHere U z performs a transposition along the codiagonal\nof U . With (11) Sa is always violated.\nLikewise, one can show that, if the Hamiltonian is invariant under the time reversal symmetry Sb (10), then\nthe Floquet matrix has the property [29]\nU (T, t0 ) = U (T, t0 )z\n\n(13)\n\nThat symmetry will be recovered for \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0. More\ndetails about the derivation of the previous properties of\nthe operator evolution are explained in the Appendix C.\nWe introduce the quantum asymptotic current as the\nmean momentum expectation value\nZ t\ndt\u2032 h\u03c8(t\u2032 , t0 )|p\u0302|\u03c8(t\u2032 , t0 )i, (14)\nJ(t0 ) = hp\u0304it = lim 1/t\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nt0\n\nwhere p\u0304 = h\u03c8|p\u0302|\u03c8i is the mean instantaneous momentum.

The symbols indicate the corresponding\nFloquet states shown in Fig.1(b-d). The empty red circle\nindicates the existence of an avoided crossing between two\neigenstates. The empty square enclose the region of spectrum\nthat appears enlarged in Fig.3.\n\nwhere hpi\u03b1 is the mean momentum of the Floquet state\n|\u03c6\u03b1 i (see Appendix D for more details). Thus, we have\nto study the properties of Floquet states.\nIn general, the Floquet bands of the system (1-2) depend on the control parameters like amplitudes, frequencies and phase shifts of the components of the force E(t).\nWe vary the parameter \u03b8 while keeping the other fixed.\nIn Fig.2 we present the quasienergy bands as a function of \u03b8. There are two remarkable features. First, the\nspectrum exhibits two symmetries, E\u03b1 (\u03b8) = E\u03b1 (\u2212\u03b8) and\nE\u03b1 (\u03b8) = E\u03b1 (\u03b8 + \u03c0), which are consequences of the choice\n(11). Second, while some bands show strong dispersion\nupon the variation of \u03b8, reaching the maximal dispersion\nat \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2, others have a rather flat dependence. In\nFig.1(b-d) we present Husimi functions [25] for several\nFloquet states depicted by symbols in Fig.2. The Planck\nconstant ~ = 0.2 is in a range, where it is possible to establish a correspondence between different Floquet states\nand the invariant manifolds of the mixed phase space for\nthe classical limit. The states (b-d) are located in various\nregular phase space regions.\nOn the other hand, from Fig.2 we observe repulsion between some bands whereas other apparently cross each\nothers. These crossings are in fact avoided crossings\nwhich lead to interesting effects.\nFor the symmetric case \u03b8 = 0, \u00b1\u03c0 the Floquet matrix has an irreducible representation p\nusing even and odd\nbasis states |nis,a = (|ni \u00b1 | \u2212 ni)/ 2 \u2212 \u03b4n,0 . All the\nFloquet states appear as quasidegenerated doublets and\nhpi\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 (see Figs.2-3). We especially note that\nthis is true for states with arbitrarily large kinetic energy, for which the corresponding quasienergies become\n\n\f4\n\nwhere the nondiagonal term \u25b3 refers to the interaction between the states. In general, this quantity depends upon the momentum and driving field's characteristics, i.e. \u25b3 = \u25b3(p, E1 , E2 , \u03b8). On the other hand,\nthe parameter \u03b5 breaks the parity symmetry, and yields\n\u03b5 \u223c nE12 E2 sin \u03b8 at a first-order of a perturbation theory.\nIt is known that, in the absence of driving, E(t) = 0,\nthe asymptotic dependence of the splitting value on n is\n\u25b3 \u223c n\u2212n , i.e. a superexponential decay [31].\nThe eigenstates in a plane-wave basis are\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\np\n1 h\n1 * |ni + \u03b3 + 1 + \u03b3 2 * | \u2212 ni , (17)\n\u03a6s =\nL(\u03b3)\n\u0011\ni\np\n1 h\u0010\n\u03a6a =\n\u03b3 + 1 + \u03b3 2 * |ni \u2212 1 * | \u2212 ni , (18)\nL(\u03b3)\nr\n\u00112\n\u0010\np\nwhere \u03b3 = \u03b5/\u25b3 and L(\u03b3) = 1 + \u03b3 + 1 + \u03b3 2 . The\nsymmetric case, \u03b8 = 0, corresponds to the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0.\nThe eigenstate's momenta are\nps \u2248 \u2212\u03b3n,\n\npa \u2248 \u03b3n,\n\nAt the opposite limit, \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nps \u2248 \u2212n 1 + 2 ,\npa \u2248 n 1 + 2 .\n4\u03b3\n4\u03b3\n\n6\n\n0.05\n\n(a)\n\n0.04\n\n3\n\np\n\n0.03\n\n-0.73\n\n0\n0.02\n\u22123\n0.01\n\u22126\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0\n\nEn\n\nX\n6\n\n(b)\n\n0.025\n\n3\n\np\n\nalmost pairwise degenerated. Consequently, following\nthe Eq.(15), J = 0 in this case.\nFor \u03b8 6= 0, \u00b1\u03c0 the Floquet states become asymmetric and the quasidegeneracies are removed (Fig.3). Floquet states acquire a non-zero mean momentum, thus\nbecoming transporting. On the other hand, while in the\nsymmetric case it is possible to have coherent tunneling oscillations between disconnected regular islands, in\nthe non-symmetric case a possible dynamical tunneling\nis suppressed [30]. Thus, a wave packet initially located\non a Floquet state with an asymmetric distribution of\nmomentum (similar to the state shown in Fig.3b) will\nundergo a permanent directional transport.\nThis phenomenon of desymmetrization results in a non\ntrivial dependence of the momentum upon \u03b8. We can\ngain some understanding of this effect by modeling the\nevolution of two eigenstates, which form a parity-related\npair at the point \u03b8 = 0, by neglecting their coupling with\nthe rest of the states.\nTo this end, we take two eigenstates, \u03a6a and \u03a6b , which\ncan be expanded in the plane wave basis \u00b1|ni. The corresponding propagator for such a reduced system is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\u2212\u03b5 \u25b3\n,\n(16)\nUab =\n\u25b3 1+\u03b5\n\n-0.735\n\n0.02\n0.015\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.01\n\u22123\n0.005\n\u22126\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0\n\nX\n\nFIG. 3: Right panel: Quasienergy spectrum in the vicinity of\ntwo quasidenerated Floquet states.

This explains the momentum asymmetry in Fig.3\nfor values of \u03b8 slightly deviated from \u03b8 = 0.\nIV.\n\nAVERAGE CURRENT AND RESONANCES\nIN CURRENT RECTIFICATION\n\nThe asymptotic current (14) depends on the initial\nconditions, and, following Eq.(15), only those Floquet\nstates which overlap with the initial wave function, \u03c8(t0 ),\ncontribute to its subsequent time evolution. From now\non, we restrict our analysis to the initial condition in\nthe form of a plane wave with wavevector n = 0, i.e.\n\u03c8(t0 ) = |0i = \u221a12\u03c0 . This initial condition spreads over\nFloquet states with low kinetic energies, namely over\nthose eigenstates for which the Husimi representations\nlie in the chaotic layer's region (Fig.4 ).\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nFor large n, \u2206 is small, but for \u01eb = 0 (symmetric case)\nit follows \u03b3 = 0, and the eigenstates carry zero momentum. Deviating from \u03b8 = 0, the moments quickly reach\nvalues \u00b1n. That happens for E12 E2 sin \u03b8 \u226b n\u2212n\u22121 , which\nwill hold for any nonzero E1 , E2 , \u03b8, provided n is large\nenough.\n\nIn the previous section we have discussed the mechanism of the dessymetrization when we tuned the system away from the symmetry point \u03b8 = 0. In order to estimate a dc-current value we need a qualitative information about mean momentum values acquired by Floquet states. As a suitable quantity to\nstudy this issue,\nP we use the cumulative average momentum, P\u03b1 = s\u2264\u03b1 hpi\u03b1 . Fig.4 depicts the cumulative average momentum, obtained from the recursive relation\nP\u03b1+2 = P\u03b1 + hpi\u03b1+1 + hpi\u03b1+2 , with P0 = hpi0 [26].

The bars have been multiplied by a factor of 10. Bottom:\nThe plot of the average kinetic energy, complementary to the\nPoincar\u00e9 section on Fig.1(a). Starting from an initial point\n(x(t0 ), p(t0 ), we calculate the kinetic energy averaged over one\nR t +mT\nperiod, Ekin (mT ) = T1 t00+(m\u22121)T p2 (t)dt, and consequently\nplot points (x(mT ), Ekin (mT )). The parameters are the same\nas in Fig.1\n\nasymmetry stems mainly from Floquet states located\nin the chaotic layer region of the classical phase space.\nThe dependence has several peaks. The Floquet states\nwith higher values of the mean momentum, which yields\nstrong dc-currents, are located at kinetic energy's regions\nthat correspond to classical transporting resonance islands (see bottom part of the Fig.4). A more detailed\nanalysis by using the Husimi distribution confirms this\nfinding. There are infinitely many high-order resonance\nislands in the phase space of the Hamiltonian system (2)\n[27], whose sizes shrink quickly as the resonance's order\nincreases with hp2 i \u2192 \u221e. The desymmetrization effect is\nobservable only when a resonance island can host more\nthan one Floquet state. With increasing hp2 i\u03b1 , P\u03b1 approaches zero in full accordance with the fact that total\ncurrent over the whole momentum space should be zero\n[16].\nThe asymptotic current for a fixed initial condition\n|\u03c8(t0 )i depends in general on the initial time t0 . Note\nthat this is possible also in the classical case, since the\ninitial distribution may overlap with different regular\ntransporting manifolds [16]. However, if we start with\na cloud of particles located exactly inside the chaotic\nlayer, the classical asymptotic current will be independent of t0 for any choice of the distribution function over\nthe chaotic manifold. This is not true for the quantum case where the current may even change its sign\nwith the variation of t0 . It is a consequence of the\nlinear character of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation [32]. We\nwill first discuss the results obtained after averaging over\n\n0\n\u22123\n\n-2\n\n2\n\nX\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\n6\n\n2\n\nFIG. 5: The average current J (in units of the recoil momentum) vs \u03b8.

(bottom): Husimi\nfunction for the eigenstates in the avoided crossing indicated\nin Fig.2.\n\nthe initial time t0 . Then we can assign a unique curRT\nrent value, J = 1/T 0 J(t0 )dt0 , for fixed parameters\nof the ac-field, E1 , E2 , and \u03b8. Fig.5 shows the dependence of the average current on the asymmetry parameter \u03b8 for the initial condition |\u03c8i = |0i. The average current J shows the expected symmetry properties\nJ(\u03b8) = \u2212J(\u03b8 + \u03c0) = \u2212J(\u2212\u03b8). These symmetries for the\ncurrent imply that the results obtained for the interval\n(\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0/2) holds for other intervals as well.\n\nThe typical dependence of the average current J on\n\u03b8 is shown on Fig.5.The curve presents a smooth profile\nwith several peaks.\nBy comparing Fig.5 with the quasienergy spectrum\nFig.2, one can associate peaks with single sharp avoided\ncrossings (resonances) between two Floquet eigenstates.\nThe Husimi function gives us additional insights for\nthe appearance of these peaks (see insets in Fig.5). It\nshows two states that are located in the chaotic layer,\none of them near p = 0, while the other is off the line\np = 0 with a strong asymmetry in momentum, corresponding to a regular transporting manifold. Off resonance the initial zero-plane wave state mainly overlaps\nwith the first eigenstate, which yields some nonzero current due to desymmetrization. At resonance this eigenstate mixes with the \"transporting\" one, resulting in a\nstrong enhancement of the current which is reflected in\nthe presence of peaks.\nFrom an experimental point of view a too narrow resonance may become undetectable due to resolution limitations. We thus studied how to vary the width of the\nresonance without much affecting its amplitude. It turns\nout to be possible by tuning another control parameter,\n\n\f6\n0.06\n\n(a)\nE\u03b1\n\n0.03\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nJ 0\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\nE\u03b1\n\n-0.03\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n-0.06\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\n-2\n\n0\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n6\n0.025\n\n(b)\n\np\n\n3\n\n0.02\n0.015\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\u22123\n0.005\n\u22126\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 7: Current dependence on the initial time t0 and \u03b8.

(b) Husimi function for the upper eigenstate that\nappears in (a) (top right inset) with \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2.\n\ne.g. the amplitude E2 . We decrease this field amplitude\nin order to disentangle the two Floquet states and remove\nthe avoided crossing. That will happen for some value of\nE2 at \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2. The details of the quasienergy spectrum around that critical point are shown in the insets\nin Fig.6a. The two quasienergy spectra disentangle for\nE2 = 1 but stay close over a sufficient broader range of \u03b8\nvalues. Thus the resonances become broader, as seen in\nFig.6a. Further decrease of E2 to a value of 0.95 leads to\na strong separation of the two spectra, and consequently\nto a fast decay of the amplitude of the resonance.\nAs we already know, in resonance Floquet states mix.\nHere the new eigenstate contain contributions both from\nthe original chaotic state as well as from the regular\ntransporting island state (see Fig.6). The Husimi distribution of this mixed state shows strong asymmetry as\nexpected. The states from the chaotic sea and the regular\ntransporting island are connected by a narrow isthmus.\nTherefore, it is possible to leak from the nonstransporting to the transporting island, which, in principle, should\nreduce significantly the observation time for the detection of resonances. It was shown in [28], for the classical\nlimit, that for a maximum desymmetrization of the phase\nspace, particles may stick to a regular island leading to\na ballistic flight. Hence, based on the classical analog,\nwe can say that our hybrid state serves as a quantum\nballistic channel.\n\nOn the other hand, as already mentioned, the asymptotic current depends on the initial time t0 . The observed resonance structures, due to resonant interaction\nbetween Floquet states (avoided crossings of quasienergies), are independent of the initial time t0 . In Fig.7 we\nplot the nonaveraged current as a function of both \u03b8 and\nt0 . While the smooth background is barely resolvable\nwith the naked eye, the resonances are clearly seen, and\ntheir position is not depending on t0 , while their amplitude does. That implies that one can further maximize\nthe resonant current by choosing properly the initial values for t0 .\nSo far, we have considered only the frequencies, \u03c9 =\n2, 3 (Figs.1-7). To gain a better understanding of the resonances, we compute the dependence of the current as a\nfunction of the frequency of the driving force (see Fig.8).\nThis figure shows the appearance of peaks, whose amplitudes increase as the frequency decreases. However, for\nlarger frequencies, peaks show up for specific frequencies,\na result which depends on the drive amplitudes. Interestingly, one can notice the inversion of current.\nIn order to increase the current, we reduce the frequency of the ac-force E(t). The asymptotic current for\n\u03c9 = 1 is shown in the inset of Fig.8. We again observe\na clear broad resonance, but the maximum current value\nincreases by an order of magnitude up to 0.5 in units of\nrecoil momenta.\nReal experiments are always limited by a finite observation time. Therefore, the rate of convergence to the\nasymptotic current value, Eq.(12), becomes a crucial issue. To give a more realistic approach of our above results\nto experiments, we perform numerical computations using the running average momentum (current) definition,\nP =\n\n1\nt\n\nZ\n\nt\n\np\u0304dt.\n\n(21)\n\n0\n\nThe time evolution for the instantaneous momentum\nP (t) is shown in Fig.9.

Inset: Asymptotic\ncurrent as a function of the initial condition t0 at \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2.\nThe parameters are E1 = 2, E2 = 1.5, ~ = 1, \u03c9 = 1, K = 1.5,\ns = 0.25, \u03b8pot = \u03c0/2.\n\nIt is easy to see that a two-harmonic potential Eq.(23)\nis insufficient to break the time-reversal symmetry S2\n(25). Thus an asymmetric ac-modulated function E(t)\nis needed to desymmetrize the system. We use the\ntwo-harmonic function (11), which ensures that for\n\u03b8p 6= 0, \u00b1\u03c0 and \u03b8 6= 0, \u00b1\u03c0 all the relevant symmetries,\nEqs.(24,25,26,27), are violated. As stated before the\nquantum system inherits the same symmetries as the\nclassical limit. Therefore a current should appear as the\nsymmetries are broken.\nFig.10 shows the average current J versus \u03b8 for the\nasymmetric potential, \u03b8p = \u2212\u03c0/2, at strong quantum\nlimit ~ = 1. Since the current dependence possesses the\nsymmetry J(\u03b8) = \u2212J(\u03b8 + \u03c0) = \u2212J(\u2212\u03b8), it is sufficient to\nplot the current for the interval \u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, 0). As for the\ncase of rocking ratchets, we found evidence for quantum\nresonances and dependence of the asymptotic current on\nthe initial time t0 (see inset in Fig.10).\n\nWe introduce the transformation\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\n|\u03c8\u0303i = exp xA(t) |\u03c8i\n~\nRt\nwith A(t) = \u2212 0 E(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 .\nSubstituting into Eq.(1) we can\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation as\n\nrewrite\n\nthe\n\n\u2202\n|\u03c8\u0303(t)i = H\u0303(t)|\u03c8\u0303(t)i,\n(A1)\n\u2202t\nh\ni2\nwhere H\u0303(t) = 12 p\u0302 \u2212 A(t)\n+ [1 + cos(x)].\n~\nTo compute the momentum we start from the definition\ni~\n\n\u2202\np\u0303(t) = h\u03c8\u0303| \u2212 i~ |\u03c8\u0303i =\n\u2202x\nZ \u221e\n\u2202\n\u2212i~\n\u03c8\u0303 \u2217 \u03c8\u0303dx = p(t) + A(t)\n\u2202x\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere hp\u0303i = hpi.\nThe kinetic energy T is given by\n\u001d\n\u001c\n2\n2 \u2202\n\u03c8 =\nT (t) = \u03c8 \u2212~\n\u2202x2\n\u001c\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015 \u001d\n2\ni\ni\n2 \u2202\nexp xA(t) \u03c8\u0303 \u2212~\nexp \u2212 xA(t) \u03c8\u0303 .

The key mechanism of the current\nrectification is the desymmetrization of Floquet states.\nA peculiarity of the quantum ratchet is its strong\ndependence of the current on the chosen initial time t0\nof the applied field. We identified quantum resonances\ninduced by avoided crossings between Floquet states\nwhich enhance the current drastically. Optimizing the\ndrive frequency, amplitude and initial phase, resonant\ncurrents easily reach the recoil momentum value and\nshould be experimentally observable using driven cold\natoms in optical lattices [18, 33].\n\nhT i = hT\u0303 i \u2212 2hA(t)T \u0303 (t)i + hA(t)2 i.\n\n(A5)\n\nRecalling the Husimi distribution,\n\u03c1(hxi, hpi) =\n\n1\n|h\u03c8|\u03a6hxi,hpi i|2 ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(A6)\n\nwe can recast it in the new frame of variables as,\n\n\u03c1\u0303(hxi, hpi)\n\nZ \u221e\n2\n(hxi\u2212x)2\nx\n1\ne\u2212i ~ A(t) \u03c8 \u2217 (x, t)eihpix+ 4\u03c32 dx\n=\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n2\n(hxi\u2212x)2\nA(t)\n1\n\u03c8 \u2217 (x, t)ei[hpi\u2212 ~ ]x+ 4\u03c32 dx\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\u001b\n\u001a\nA(t)\n.\n(A7)\n= \u03c1 hxi, hpi \u2212\n~\n\n\f9\nFinally, after reversing the operations, we find\n\u001a\n\u001b\nA(t)\n\u03c1(hxi, hpi) = \u03c1\u0303 hxi, hpi +\n.\n~\n\n(A8)\n\nAPPENDIX B: NUMERICAL INTEGRATION\nSCHEMES\n\nIn order to find the numerical solution for the timedependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation we have used two different methods of integration. The first method has been\ndescribed in [34]. It starts by using the expansion Eq.(6)\nand approximating\n\u00c2(t) =\n\nX\n\u2206t\nA(t)\n\u03b4(t \u2212 k\u2206t),\n~\n\n(B1)\n\nk\n\nfor the time dependence of the vector potential A(t) =\nRt\n\u2212 t0 E(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 , with \u2206t = 2\u03c0/(\u03c9Nt ), where Nt is the number of integration steps per period.\nThe integration is carried out computing the coefficients cn (tk +\u2206t) (tk = k\u2206t) by successive multiplication\nof the vector cn (tk ) by a unitary matrix\nc(tk + \u2206t) = U QV Q\u22121 c(tk )\nwhere U and V are diagonal matrices with\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\nA(t) A(t)2\n\u2206t 2\nn \u2212 2n\n+\nUn,n = exp \u2212i~\n2\n~\n~2\n\n(B2)\n\n(B3)\n\nand Vn,n = exp(\u2212i\u2206t\u1e7dn ).\n\u1e7dn are the eigenvalues of the matrix representation\nM of the operator (1/~) cos(x\u0302). Q is an orthogonal\n(unitary) matrix that transforms M into diagonal form\n(M = Q\u1e7c Q\u22121 ). \u1e7c is a diagonal matrix with elements\n\u1e7dn .\nThe symmetric matrix M has the structure Mn,m =\n(\u03b4m,n+1 +\u03b4m,n\u22121 )/(2~). This method permits to decrease\nthe number of steps per period [35]. Nevertheless, it involves several matrix products and therefore its efficiency\nis degraded.\nTo check our results we use a second integration\nmethod which is more efficient [29]. We expand again\nover plane waves but this time we write down the expansion coefficients as a product of two time dependent\nfunctions, viz.\n|\u03c8(t)i =\n\nN\nX\n\nan (t)\u03c6n (t)|ni.\n\n(B4)\n\nn=\u2212N\n\nwe obtain for \u03c6n (t) the solution\n\u001a\n\u0014\nZ\n~ 2\n2n t\n\u03c6n (t) = exp \u2212i n t \u2212\nA(t\u2032 )dt\u2032\n2\n~ 0\n\u0015\u001b\nZ t\n1\n\u2032 2 \u2032\n+ 2\nA(t ) dt\n.\n~ 0\n\nThen inserting Eq.(B4) into Eq.(A1) we obtain the set of\nequations for the amplitudes an (t)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c6tn\u22121\n1 \u03c6tn+1\n(B7)\na\n+\na\n\u0227n = \u2212i\nn+1\nn\u22121 .\n2~ \u03c6tn\n\u03c6tn\nTo obtain the propagator U (T, 0), we start with the\ninitial states akn = \u03b4n,k , where \u2212N \u2264 n, k \u2264 N and\nintegrate over one time period T . Here the column of\nthe matrix for the propagator is given by an (T )\u03c6n (T ).\nFor the computation we have neglected the contribution\noriginating from A2 (t) and the constant term 1/~ in the\npotential since they only yield global phase factors.\nAPPENDIX C: SYMMETRIES OF THE\nFLOQUET OPERATOR\n\nLet us first analyze the time reversal symmetry:\nSb : t \u2192 \u2212t,\n\nx \u2192 \u2212x.\n\nIn the momentum representation basis, |ni, this transformation implies several operations including complex\nconjugation, and inversions n \u2192 \u2212n.\nIn that case the Floquet operator possesses the property\nU (T, t0 ) \u2261 U (T, t0 )z ,\nwhose matrix elements obey\nun,m = u\u2212n,\u2212m .\nThe latter relation holds whenever the transformation is\ndone around the symmetric points, namely t0 = ts .\nLet us analyze the symmetry\nSa : t \u2192 t + T /2,\n\nx \u2192 \u2212x.\n\nThis corresponds to the transformation\nt \u2192 t + T /2,\n\nn \u2192 \u2212n.\n\nFor the Floquet operator we get\nU (T, 0) \u2261 U (T, T /2)U (T /2, 0)\n\u2261 U (T /2, 0)zT U (T /2, 0).\nThis implies that\nU \u2192 U zT ,\n\nAssuming that \u03c6n is a solution of the problem\n\u0014\n\u00152\n~2\nA(t)\ni~\u2202t \u03c6n (t) =\nn\u2212\n\u03c6n ,\n2\n~\n\nor, equivalently,\n(B5)\n\n(B6)\n\nun,m = u\u2212n,\u2212m .\n\n(C1)\n\n\f10\nAPPENDIX D: ASYMPTOTIC CURRENT\n\nStarting from an initial plane wave |0i, the coefficients\nbecome C\u03b1 = b\u03b1,0 .
