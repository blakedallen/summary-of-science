While at low densities, we find good agreement with the universal results depending only\non the scattering length as , at moderate and high densities, the transition temperature is strongly\naffected by interactions and the elementary excitation spectrum. The results are expected to be of\nrelevance to dipolar atomic and molecular systems and indirect excitons in quantum wells.\n\nDipolar bosonic systems are of increasing interest for\nvarious recent experiments studying the onset of superfluidity in nonideal Bose systems and its connection\nwith correlation and quantum degeneracy effects. Examples include dipolar gases, as in recent studies of 52 Cr\natoms [1], bosonic molecules, e.g. SrO, RbCs, LiCs,\n40 87\nK Rb [2], as well as indirect excitons in semiconductor\nquantum wells [3, 4]. A number of theoretical and computational studies have addressed the properties of twodimensional (2D) repulsive dipolar bosons at zero and\nlow temperatures [5\u20137]. They include the ground-state\nenergy, the structural and coherence properties, such as\nthe one-body density matrix and the condensate fraction.\nQuantum Monte Carlo studies at T = 0 have covered the\nwhole range of coupling strengths up to the crystallization transition. However, the finite-temperature properties, in particular, the superfluid transition temperature\nTc , remain unexplored.\nPrevious numerical investigations for 2D homogeneous\nBose gases [8, 9] have shown that in the dilute (weak\ncoupling) regime, na2s . 10\u22122 , where n is the density\nand as the s-wave scattering length, the exact shape of\nthe interaction potential is irrelevant for Tc which is a\nfunction of na2s only [10]\nTc (n) =\n\n2\u03c0~2 n\n1\n,\nmkB ln(\u03bd/4\u03c0) + ln ln(1/na2s )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the numerical coefficient is \u03bd = 380(3) [11]. However, for moderate and high densities where correlation\neffects are important no analytical expression is available for Tc , calling for investigations by direct numerical\nsimulations which is the main goal of the present paper.\nBy performing first principle path integral Monte Carlo\n(PIMC) simulations we demonstrate that, with increasing interaction strength, the superfluid phase is first stabilized (Tc increases) and then destabilized and vanishes\nwhen the system forms a dipolar solid. We present an explanation of this non-monotonic behavior of Tc suggesting that it arises from a competition between two types\nof elementary excitations in the normal fluid component\n\u2013 phonons and rotons.\n\nModel and parameters. We focus on a pure\ndipole model relevant e.g. for various bosonic atoms or\nmolecules and indirect excitons at low densities where\nthe dipole moment is a free parameter which can be externally controlled, e.g. via an electric field [4, 12]. The\n2D dipole system is described by the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\nN\nX\n~2 \u2207 2\ni\n\ni=1\n\n2m\n\n+\n\n1X\np2\n,\n2\n\u000fb |r i \u2212 r j |3\n\n(2)\n\ni6=j\n\nwhich is\n\u221a brought to a dimensionless form using the units\na = 1/ n and E0 = ~2 /ma2 . The system properties are\ndefined by the dipole coupling D = p2 /\u000fb a3 E0 and the\ntemperature, T = kB T /E0 . The thermodynamic equilibrium states of system (2) were sampled by PIMC simulations with the worm algorithm [13]. We studied the\nsystem (2) from weak to strong coupling, D = 0.01 . . . 20.\nIn agreement with Refs. [5\u20137] we observe formation of a\ncrystalline phase at D ' 18.\nSuperfluid transition and phase diagram. In 2D\nthe superfluid-normal phase transition occurs at a finite\ntemperature Tc and follows the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless scenario (BKT) induced by interaction effects [14]. To obtain a reliable result for Tc in the thermodynamic limit,\n\u221a Tc (\u221e), from simulations of a finite system\nof size L = N , we apply a finite-size scaling analysis to\nTc (L). We assume the essential singularity [15] of the\n\u22121/2\ncorrelation length \u03be(T ) \u223c eat\n, t = (T /Tc \u2212 1)|T \u2192Tc ,\nwith a being a non-universal temperature-density dependent scaling factor.

Here, the superfluid density ns is obtained\nvia the winding number estimator [17], ns (L, T ) =\nmkB T hW2 i(T, L)/2~2 which is directly evaluated by\nPIMC simulations. Combining this with Eq.

Note that, while\nS(q, T ) shows some T -dependence for qa < 3, the Feynman spectrum, \u03c9F (q, T ), stays almost unchanged in a\nbroad temperature interval, T . 3.3, and is close to\nthe ground state result [7, 24]. Therefore, the spectra\nshown in Fig. 4 for T = 0.5 are representative for the\nlow-temperature behavior.\nIn the long wavelength limit, qa \u2192 0, \u03c9F becomes\nexact yielding a linear dispersion, \u03c9F (q) = cs q, cf. Fig. 4a\nwhich is in agreement with the result for classical 2D\ndipoles [22, 23]. Our results for the sound speed, cs (T ) =\n\u03c9F (q, T )/q|q\u21920 , extracted from the data for N = 324\nparticles are summarized in Tab.

We observe\nthat Tc (L) shifts systematically with L to lower values\n(Fig. 1a). The extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit,\nTc (\u221e), fitting the simulation data by Eq. (3), is reported\nin Fig. 1b. For strong coupling (D \u2265 10) the finite-size\ncorrections to Tc in Eq. (3) become important, therefore,\nwe excluded from the fit the smallest system (N = 36).\nUsing the extrapolated data, Tc (\u221e, D), we construct\nthe phase diagram, cf. Fig. 2 and Table I. At small coupling, D . 0.01, our results are well reproduced by the\nasymptotic expression (1), i.e. here, details of the interaction potential are not important. However, the validity range of Eq. (1) is limited to very low densities,\nna2s . 10\u22123 [computing the scattering length from the\nsolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for 2D dipoles gives\nthe relation na2s \u2248 10.05D2 ]. This density is an order\nof magnitude smaller than for a 2D gas of hard disks [9]\nindicating that the long-range character of the dipole interaction causes substantially earlier deviations from the\ndilute gas limit.\nNow we analyze, in more detail, the change of Tc with\ncoupling, Fig. 2. For small D, Tc monotonically increases\nand reaches a maximum around 1 < D < 2 whereas, for\nlarger couplings, Tc monotonically decreases again until\nthe system freezes into a non-superfluid dipole crystal.\n[This is preceded by a narrow hysteresis region (15 < D <\n18), shown by the vertical dashed lines, where a bubbletype structure is expected [19] which, however, is beyond\nthe scope of the present paper.] In the following, we\ndemonstrate that the non-monotonic behavior of Tc (D)\ncan be explained by the excitation spectrum.\nExcitation spectrum.

With the increase\nof D (Fig. 3b) the response function sharpens and shifts\ncontinuously towards q0 .\nIn Fig. 4 we show \u03c9\u03c7 , Eq. (5), together with the Feynman spectrum and the correlated basis functions (CBF)\nresult [27] at four dipole couplings. All three approximations show the same general trend which resembles superfluid helium: with increasing coupling the spectrum\ndevelops a roton minimum at finite q \u2248 q0 which becomes\ndeeper with increasing D. While for qa . 1.5 (sound\nrange) all approaches are in quantitative agreement, for\nqa > 2 the Feynman approximation becomes inaccurate.\nIts error increases with D and exceeds 100% at the crystallization point for \u03c9 at the minimum. The PIMC result\n\u03c9\u03c7 (q) agrees suprisingly well with \u03c9CBF (q). Our simulations predict a deeper minimum \u03c9(q0 ) and are expected\nto be more accurate here. Further, for q & 7.5, the upper\nbound \u03c9\u03c7 (q) approaches a free-particle spectrum (similar to \u03c9F ), except for D & 15, whereas CBF, at strong\ncoupling (D = 15), shows the onset of a plateau.

(3),\nis related to the normal density by ns (T ) = n \u2212 nn (T )\n\nwhich for non-interacting quasiparticles is determined by\nthe excitation spectrum \u03b5p = ~\u03c9\u03c7 (p; D, T ) via the Landau formula [28]\nZ \u221e\ndnB\n1 1\nQP\nd2 p p2\n,\n(6)\nnn (T ) = \u2212\n2 (2\u03c0~)2 0\nd\u03b5p\nwhere nB = [e\u03b2\u03b5p \u22121]\u22121 is the Bose distribution function,\nand we used m = 1. The superscript QP denotes the\ndilute quasiparticle approximation.\nAt low temperatures the main contribution to nQP\nn ,\nEq. (6), comes from the lowest energy quasiparticles \u2013\nr\nphonons \u2013 with the dispersion \u03b5ph\np = cp, and rotons, \u03b5p =\n2\n\u2206 + (p \u2212 p0 ) /2\u03bc, with the approximate result [28] in 2D\n3\u03b6(3) (kB T )3\n(kB T )3\n3\u03b5\u0304ph\n=\n=\n0.574\n,\n(7)\n2c2\n2\u03c0\n~2 c4\n~2 c4\n2\n\u03b2p0\np0 \u2212\u03b2\u2206\n\u2248\ne\n(2\u03c0\u03bckB T )1/2 .

We note that \u2206 in the liquid phase decreases exponentially with the dipole coupling: \u2206(D)/E0 = a1 exp(\u2212a2 D \u2212 a3 D2 ), with the\nbest fit parameters: a1 = 15.11(5), a2 = 0.088(2),\na3 = \u22120.00120(8), whereas at the crystallization point\nwe find \u2206(D = 18)/E0 = 4.57.\nr\nConsider now the D-dependence of nph\nn and nn , cf.\nlower part of Fig. 2. At weak coupling, D . 1, there is\nno roton minimum in the spectrum, cf. Fig. 4, D = 1,\nand nrn = 0. At the same time there is a strong phonon\ncontribution, nph\nn , which monotonically decreases with D\nsince, at a fixed temperature, the sound speed increases\nwith coupling, cs \u223c D1/2 , cf. Tab. I. As soon as the\nspectrum contains a roton minimum, i.e. for D & 1.5, cf.\nFig. 4, phonon excitations are practically negligible and\nthe rotons dominate which is due to the larger density\nof states (\u223c qdq). The roton density nrn monotonically\nincreases with D, cf. Fig. 2.b due to the reduction of\nthe roton gap, cf. Tab. I. These competing trends of\nphonon and roton excitations give rise to a minimum in\nr\nthe sum nph\nn (D) + nn (D) at a coupling around D = 1.5.\nNote that this sum of the approximate contributions (7),\n(8) rather well reproduces the full quasiparticle density\nnQP\nn (D), Eq. (6).\nMost interestingly, the position of the minimum is very\nclose to the maximum of the superfluid transition temperature Tc which is observed in the range D ' 1 \u2212 1.75,\nand the Tc (D) appears to follow just the opposite behavior of the curve nQP\nn (D). In fact, this opposite trend\ncould be expected from Eq. (3) stating that Tc \u223c n \u2212 nn\nwhere nn (Tc ) is the full normal density at the critical\npoint. However, there is no obvious reason why nn (D)\nshould follow nQP\nin the case of strongly interacting\nn\nbosons. Our simulations allow us to directly compare\n\n\f4\nthe exact value, nn to nQP\nn . As can be seen in Fig. 2.b\nthere is a dramatic difference between the two indicating\nthe existence of an additional contribution nvn to the norv\nmal density, i.e. nn = nQP\nn +nn , which is by far dominant\nin the region around the maximum of Tc exceeding nQP\nn\nby as much as a factor thirty.\nThe physical origin of nvn are interaction effects and\nvortices missing in the model (6). Large scale vortices are a key in the BKT theory and they are known\nto substantially reduce the true macroscopic superfluid\ndensity ns compared to its local value nloc\ns (T ). It has\nbeen shown that this suppression is similar to screening\n[14, 29] characterized by an effective dielectric function,\nns = nloc\ns /\u000f. For the present system, it is reasonable to\nQP\nidentify nloc\nwhich relates \u000f to nvn according\ns \u2192 n \u2212 nn\nv\nQP\nto nn = (n \u2212 nn )(1 \u2212 \u000f\u22121 ). Our simulations allow us\nto directly compute the vortex density and \u000f(D) for all\ncouplings, the results are included in table I. Notice that\nnvn and \u000f rapidly increase for strong coupling. However,\nfor D . 3, i.e. in the range where Tc (D) reaches its\nmaximum they are almost D-independent. This behavr\nior is constrast to the one of nph\nn (D) and nn (D). Thus\nwe may conclude that - despite the small absolute value\nr\nv\nof nph\nn (D) and nn (D) compared to nn , it is the phonon\nand roton excitations which are responsible for the shape\nof the phase boundary Tc (D) and for the stabilization of\nthe superfluid phase around D ' 1 \u2212 1.75.\nTABLE I: Coupling parameter dependence of the superfluid\ntransition temperature Tc , the superfluid fraction \u03b3s (Tc ) =\n2mTc /\u03c0~2 n, the sound speed cs [in units of the dipole fre2\n= 2\u03c0p2 n/(m\u01013 ), \u0101 = (\u03c0n)\u22121/2 ], the vortex\nquency, [\u03c9D \u0101], \u03c9D\nv\ndensity nn (Tc ) and the effective dielectric function, \u000f(Tc ).\nD\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n1.75\n3\n5\n7.5\n10\n12.5\n15\n\nTc [E0 ]\n1.174(2)\n1.304(7)\n1.400(4)\n1.391(5)\n1.353(5)\n1.294(4)\n1.216(6)\n1.123(7)\n1.006(4)\n0.906(3)\n\n\u03b3s (Tc )\n0.75\n0.83\n0.89\n0.88\n0.86\n0.82\n0.77\n0.71\n0.64\n0.58\n\ncs\n3.60\n2.23\n1.59\n1.48\n1.41\n1.36\n1.31\n1.30\n1.28\n1.28\n\n\u2206[E0 ] nvn (Tc )\n\u2013\n0.12\n\u2013\n0.13\n\u2013\n0.10\n13.02 0.11\n11.73 0.13\n10.00 0.17\n8.35 0.21\n7.12 0.26\n6.06 0.32\n5.27 0.38\n\n\u000f(Tc )\n1.16\n1.15\n1.12\n1.13\n1.15\n1.20\n1.27\n1.36\n1.51\n1.66\n\nIn conclusion, the finite-temperature phase diagram\nof a 2D dipole system has been investigated by firstprinciple PIMC simulations over the entire coupling\nregime. We found that the superfluid density at Tc does\nnot exceed 90% and drops to about 58% near the crystallization point. The normal density is dominated by vortices and contains a small fraction of phonons and rotons.\nYet the competition of the latter two is responsible for\nthe observed non-monotonic behavior of Tc (D). Furthermore, an upper bound for the single-particle spectrum\nhas been computed which significantly improves the re-\n\nsult of the Feynman approximation. We expect that our\npredictions are of direct relevance for experiments with\natomic and molecular dipole systems as well as for indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells.\nThis work is support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via grant FI 1252/1.\n\n[1] A.
