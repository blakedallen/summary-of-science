This paper reports the results obtained on the photometric redshifts measurement and accuracy, and cluster tomography in\nthe ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) fields.\nAims. We present the methods used to determine photometric redshifts to discriminate between member and non-member galaxies\nand reduce the contamination by faint stars in subsequent spectroscopic studies.\nMethods. Photometric redshifts were computed using two independent codes both based on standard spectral energy distribution\n(SED) fitting methods (Hyperz and G. Rudnick's code). Simulations were used to determine the redshift regions for which a reliable\ndetermination of photometric redshifts was expected. The accuracy of the photometric redshifts was assessed by comparing our\nestimates with the spectroscopic redshifts of \u223c 1400 galaxies in the 0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 1.0 domain. The accuracy expected for galaxies fainter\nthan the spectroscopic control sample was estimated using a degraded version of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample.\nResults. The accuracy of photometric redshifts is typically \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) \u223c 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, depending on the field, the filter set, and\nthe spectral type of the galaxies. The quality of the photometric redshifts degrades by a factor of two in \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) between the\nbrightest (I <\u223c 22) and the faintest (I \u223c24-24.5) galaxies in the EDisCS sample. The photometric determination of cluster redshifts in\nthe EDisCS fields using a simple algorithm based on z phot is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic values, such that \u03b4z \u223c0.030.04 in the high-z sample and \u03b4z \u223c0.05 in the low-z sample, i.e. the z phot cluster redshifts are at least a factor \u223c (1 + z) more accurate\nthan the measurements of z phot for individual galaxies. We also developed a method that uses both photometric redshift codes jointly\nto reject interlopers at magnitudes fainter than the spectroscopic limit. When applied to the spectroscopic sample, this method rejects\n\u223c 50 \u2212 90% of all spectroscopically confirmed non-members, while retaining & 90% of all confirmed members.\nConclusions. Photometric redshifts are found to be particularly useful for the identification and study of clusters of galaxies in large\nsurveys. They enable efficient and complete pre-selection of cluster members for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the\ncluster redshifts based on photometry alone, and provide a means of determining cluster membership, especially for bright sources.\nKey words.

Introduction\nPhotometric redshifts are becoming an important tool in cosmological studies based on large and/or deep photometric surveys.\n\n\f2\n\nR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\nDifferent studies have been devoted to the detailed analysis of\nphotometric redshift accuracy in different contexts (e.g. Ilbert et\nal. 2006, Feldmann et al. 2006, Mobasher et al. 2007, Banerji et\nal. 2008, Margoniner & Wittman 2008, Hildebrandt et al. 2008,\nIlbert et al. 2009). The robust evaluation of the accuracy reached\nby photometric redshifts requires homogeneous deep photometric data and a large dataset of spectroscopic redshifts for the\nsame field. Simulations can be used to achieve uniform coverage\nin parameter spaces beyond the limits of spectroscopic surveys,\nin particular when missing information about certain redshift domains and/or spectroscopic types of galaxies.\nSeveral papers used a recalibration between data and template models to improve the precision of photometric redshifs\n(e.g. Coe et al. 2006, Ilbert et al. 2006, Feldmann et al. 2006,\nMobasher et al. 2007, Capak et al. 2007, Ilbert et al. 2009), a\nmethod that requires a large and representative training set of\nspectroscopic redshifts. However, model templates, optimized to\nachieve the highest possible accuracy in a given catalog/field, are\nnot necesarily optimal in all cases because systematic problems\nin the catalog photometry could remain unrecognized during the\ntemplate calibration process. A more robust estimate of photometric redshifts accuracy can be achieved for large datasets acquired in different independent fields. This is the approach used\nin this paper.\nThe ESO Distant Cluster Survey (hereafter EDisCS) is an\nESO Large Programme designed to study the evolution of cluster\ngalaxies over a significant fraction of cosmic time (White et al.\n2005). The 20 clusters included in the EDisCS sample were selected from the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey (LCDCS;\nGonzalez et al. 2001) with redshifts ranging between \u223c0.4 and 1.\nMore details about the survey and the cluster selection procedure\ncan be found in the paper by White et al. (2005), and the EDisCS\nwebsite1 . The EDisCS programme includes homogeneous and\ndeep photometry with ESO VLT and NTT (optical and near-IR;\nWhite et al. 2005, Arag\u00f3n\u2013Salamanca et al. in preparation) and\nmulti-object spectroscopy with ESO VLT (Halliday et al. 2004,\nMilvang-Jensen et al. 2008), as well as other follow-up observations with HST/ACS (Desai et al. 2007), narrowband H\u03b1 imaging (Finn et al. 2005) and XMM data (Johnson et al. 2006).\nThis paper is also intended to be the reference for the photometric redshifts and the cluster membership criteria adopted\nby the EDisCS collaboration, and used in the different EDisCS\npapers dealing with cluster membership and related quantities\n(e.g. De Lucia et al. 2004, White et al. 2005, Clowe et al. 2006,\nPoggianti et al. 2006, De Lucia et al. 2007, Desai et al. 2007,\nRudnick et al. 2009). Photometric redshifts are particularly useful when used with cluster/structure finding algorithms, because\nthey help to ensure that time-consuming spectroscopic observations are optimized (e.g. Li & Yee 2008).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we summarize\nthe characteristics of the relevant photometric and spectroscopic\ndata. A technical description of the photometric redshift methods\nand related procedures is provided in Sect. 3. The photometric\nredshift accuracy in the EDisCS survey is addressed in Sect. 4\nusing three different approaches: 1) simulations are used to determine the redshift regions for which a reliable determination of\nphotometric redshifts is expected; 2) the actual quality achieved\nin this survey is estimated by direct comparison between the\nphotometric and spectroscopic redshifts, and 3) the accuracy expected for galaxies fainter than the spectroscopic control sample\nis estimated using a degraded version of the spectroscopic sample catalog. Section 5 presents the comparison between spec1\n\nhttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/ediscs\n\ntroscopic and photometric determinations of cluster redshifts, as\nwell as the results obtained on cluster tomography in the EDisCS\nfields. The photometric cluster membership criteria adopted by\nthe EDisCS collaboration is introduced and discussed in Sect. 6.\nDiscussion and conclusions are given in Sect. 7. The following cosmological parameters are adopted throughout this paper:\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.3, and H0 = 70 km s\u22121 M pc\u22121 . Magnitudes\nare given in the Vega system.\n\n2. Photometric and spectroscopic data\nWe use the ground-based photometric catalogs and spectroscopic redshifts obtained by the EDisCS collaboration for 20\nclusters of galaxies with redshifts ranging between 0.4 and 1.0\n(White et al. 2005). Although the final redshift distribution of\nthis sample is found to be fairly uniformly distributed within this\nredshift interval, the original filter set was designed to bracket\nthe relevant wavelength domain at z\u223c0.5 (low-z sample) and\nz\u223c0.8 (high-z sample). Photometric redshifts and related quantities depend strongly on the wavelength domain covered by the\nphotometric Spectral Energy Distributions (hereafter SED), i.e.\nthe filter set. Throughout the paper, we therefore retain the original division of the clusters into the \"low-z\" and the \"high-z\"\nsamples.\nDeep optical photometric data was acquired with FORS2 at\nthe VLT, in BVI and VRI bands for the low-z and the high-z cluster samples, respectively. The photometric depth (5\u03c3 in 1\u2032\u2032 radius\naperture) is typically 26.4(B), 26.2(V) and 24.8(I) in the low-z\nsample, and 26.5(V), 26.0(R) and 25.2(I) in the high-z sample\n(see also White et al. 2005, Table 1). The field of view covered\nby these data is 6.5' \u00d7 6.5'. Seeing conditions were excellent\nduring all imaging observations, ranging typically between 0.5\"\nand 0.8\" (see White et al. 2005 for details). Deep near-IR images were also obtained for almost all clusters with SOFI at\nthe NTT, in K s and JK s for the low-z and the high-z samples,\nrespectively (details are provided by Arag\u00f3n-Salamanca et al.\n2009, in preparation). The photometric depth (5\u03c3) is typically\n22.8 in J and 21.5 in K s . These data cover a field of 4.2'\u00d7 6.0'\nat low-z, and 4.2'\u00d7 5.4' at high-z. Photometry was performed\non seeing\u2013matched images using SExtractor v.2.2.2 (Bertin &\nArnouts 1996). Table 3 summarizes the filter set used to compute\nphotometric redshifts for each cluster in the EDisCS sample.\nSpectroscopic data in the EDisCS fields were obtained\nduring three observing runs with FORS2 at VLT, using the\n600RI+19 grism. The wavelength domain covered by our observations ranged between \u223c 5300 and 9000 \u00c5. More details can\nbe found in the reference papers by Halliday et al. (2004) and\nMilvang-Jensen et al. (2008). The total number of good quality spectra acquired per field ranged between \u223c60 and 100 for\nthe low-z sample, and was around \u223c100 for the high-z sample.\nThere are typically 30-50 confirmed members in every cluster.\nWe use objects with either secure spectroscopic redshifts (hereafter type 1) or medium quality, slightly tentative redshifts (hereafter type 2) to characterize the behavior of photometric redshifts\nand cluster-membership criteria. Objects with tentative redshifts\n(\u223c 50% secure, type 3) represent less than 2% of the total sample and are mostly used for illustration pusposes. The total number of spectroscopic redshifts available is 637(977) in the lowz(high-z) samples, from which the total number of secure (secure\n+ slightly tentative, i.e. type 1+2) redshifts in the 0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 1.0\ndomain are 544(564) and 854(885) respectively for the low-z\nand high-z samples (see also Table 4).\nAn important issue when deriving photometric redshifts for a\ngiven galaxy is to construct its SED using magnitudes and corre-\n\n\fR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\nsponding fluxes derived for identical aperture sizes in each of the\nbandpass images. Photometric SEDs were obtained from seeingmatched images according to the following scheme. For \"isolated\" objects (SExtractor flag =0), photometric redshifts were\nderived from isophotal magnitudes measured within the reference I-band isophotal region corresponding to 1.5 \u03c3 of the local\nbackground noise. In the case of \"crowded\" objects (SExtractor\nflag \u22650), we used magnitudes computed within 1\" radius apertures. This scheme enabled us to improve the SED determination\nin crowded regions, while increasing the S/N for isolated galaxies.\nWe did not use the standard SExtractor errors because these\nare known to underestimate the error for dithered data where adjacent pixels are correlated. We determined our errors instead\nby means of a set of empty aperture simulations as described in\nWhite et al.(2005). The accurate determination of the errors is\nimportant because photometric redshifts are sensitive to photometric errors.\nA correction for Galactic extinction was also included for\neach cluster field according to the E(B-V) derived from Schlegel\net al. (1998) for the center of the cluster. The E(B-V) corrections in the EDisCS fields typically ranged between 0.03 and\n0.08 magnitudes (see Table 3).\nBright unsaturated stars were used as secondary standards\nto check the consistency of our photometric system for deriving photometric redshifts and, when required, to introduce small\nzero-point corrections in the photometric catalogs. In practice,\nwe compared the color-color diagrams of observed stars in our\nfields with the expected positions derived using the Pickles library (Pickles 1998). Stars at this stage are objects selected with\nSExtractor stellarity index \u2265 0.95 that belong to the stellar sequence in the I-band isophotal-radius versus aperture-magnitude\ndiagrams. This procedure was particularly useful during the first\nphotometric runs to correct near-IR imaging data for the effects of non-photometric conditions. Due to the addition of highquality observations, the zero-point corrections improved successively during the lifetime of the project, in addition to the\nquality of the photometric catalogs and related quantities, such\nas photometric redshifts. The results presented here were obtained with the final version of the photometric catalogs, for\nwhich the zero-point corrections are negligible, apart from two\ncases: Cl1138-1133 (\u2206V =0.10 and \u2206J =-0.15), and Cl12321250 (\u2206J =-0.20).\nAll the results published by the EDisCS collaboration since\n2004 were obtained with the current and final version of the photometric catalogs used in this paper, publically available from\nthe EDisCS website2 . The last version of EDisCS photometric\nredshifts was obtained in April 2006. The quality of this final\nversion with respect to the previous ones (since 2004) is about\nthe same in terms of accuracy (i.e. systematic offsets, dispersion\nand catastrophic failures; see criteria in Sect. 4). The main differences come from the related quantities which are provided\nin addition to photometric redshifts (e.g. absolute magnitudes,\nphotometric classification of galaxies, ...).\n\n3. Photometric redshifts\nPhotometric redshifts (hereafter z phot ) were computed using two\ndifferent codes: a modified version of the public code Hyperz3\n(Bolzonella et al. 2000), and the code of Rudnick et al. (2001),\n2\n3\n\nhttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/ediscs\nhttp://webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/hyperz/\n\n3\n\nwith the modifications introduced by Rudnick et al. (2003) (hereafter GR code). The two codes use different approaches based on\nSED fitting procedures, as summarized below. The reader is referred to the reference papers for a more detailed description of\nthe codes themselves. Here we summarize only the main relevant settings and modifications.\nHyperz results were initially used by the EDisCS collaboration for three main purposes: to determine a first guess for\neach cluster redshift, to help in spectroscopic pre-selection, and\nto reduce the contamination by faint stars during spectroscopic\nobservations. Subsequently, the two codes were jointly used\nto establish cluster membership in magnitude-limited samples\nusing their respective normalized probability distributions (see\nSect. 6).\nWe used 14 galaxy templates with Hyperz:\n\u2013 Eight evolutionary synthetic SEDs computed with the 2003\nversion of the Bruzual & Charlot code (Bruzual & Charlot\n1993, 2003), spanning a grid of ages between 0.0001 and\n13.5 Gyrs, with Chabrier (2003) IMF and solar metallicity\n(a delta burst -SSP-, a constant star-forming system, and 6\n\u03c4-models with exponentially decaying SFR).\n\u2013 A set of 4 empirical SEDs compiled by Coleman, Wu and\nWeedman (1980) (hereafter CWW) to represent the local\npopulation of galaxies, with fixed age, extended to wavelengths \u03bb \u2264 1400 \u00c5 and \u03bb \u2265 10000 \u00c5 using the equivalent\nBruzual & Charlot spectra.\n\u2013 Two starburst galaxies (SB1 and SB2) from the Kinney et al.\n(1996) template library.\nThe internal reddening law is taken from Calzetti (2000), and\nconsidered as a free parameter with AV ranging between 0 and\n1.5 magnitudes (E(B-V) between 0 and \u223c 0.45 mags). When an\nobject is not detected in a given filter, the flux in this filter is set\nto zero with an error bar corresponding to the limiting magnitude\nthat corresponds to a S/N ratio \u223c 1 in this filter. Absolute magnitudes MB for galaxies were allowed between \u221224 \u2264 MB \u2264 \u221211,\nwhich imposed a relatively weak prior on z phot while preventing obvious catastrophic identifications in the case of degenerate\nsolutions. P(z) were normalized within the permitted redshift interval according to this restriction.\nThe GR code is based on the non-negative linear combination of redshifted galaxy templates, for which:\n\u2013 The set of 4 CWW empirical templates described above.\n\u2013 The starburst galaxies SB1 and SB2 from the Kinney et al.\n(1996).\n\u2013 A 10 Myr old, single stellar population burst obtained from\nthe 1999 version of the Bruzual & Charlot (1993) code with\nSalpeter (1955) IMF and solar metallicity.\nThe 4 CWW and starburst templates were extended from\ntheir published short-wavelength limits (1400 and 1232 \u00c5 respectively) by a power-law fit to the 1400-1800 and 1240-1740 \u00c5\nwavelength ranges, respectively, using Bruzual & Charlot (2003)\nspectra.\nThere are no limitations on absolute magnitude in the GR\ncode, and the direct flux measurements were used for all galaxies, even when an object was not formally detected.\nHyperz z phot were computed in the range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 6, whereas\nGR ones span the 0 \u2264 z \u2264 2 range. The upper limit had a\nnegligible impact on the z phot value itself and related quantities,\nexcept in the normalization of the z phot probability distribution\n(P(z)). When deriving the cluster membership criteria presented\n\n\f4\n\nR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\nin Sect. 6, P(z) computed with the two codes were normalized\nwithin the 0 \u2264 z \u2264 2 interval, and Hyperz z phot were also restricted to this interval.\n3.1. Photometric discrimination between galaxies, stars and\nquasars\n\nThe method used to discriminate photometrically between\ngalaxies, stars, and quasars, was based on Hyperz, and closely\nfollowed the developments presented in Hatziminaoglou et al.\n(2000). For stars, it was based on a standard SED fitting minimization about z \u223c 0 using the complete library of stellar templates by Pickles (1998). The galactic E(B-V) correction was\nconsidered as a free parameter, ranging between 0 and the corresponding value for the field given in Table 3. For quasars, we\nused a library of synthetic spectra similar to Hatziminaouglou et\nal. (2000), and the same prescriptions as for galaxies, apart from\nthe absolute magnitude limitation.\nIn practice, the usual Hyperz z phot for galaxies and quasars,\nand the best fit with the stellar library were computed for each\nobject, and three classification parameters were given to quantify the goodness of the best fit as a galaxy/star/quasar (respectively NG , N\u2217 and NQ ). The object was \"rejected\" as a\ngalaxy/star/quasar when its \u03c72 excluded it at higher than the\n95% confidence level (N=0). The object was \"fully compatible\"\nwhen the probability associated with the reduced \u03c72 exceeded\n90% (N=2). The object was \"undetermined\" (N= 1) in all the\nother intermediate cases. This classification allowed us to define different samples of objects in these fields, either galaxies\n(with NG \u2265 1, irrespective of the star type) or stars (with N\u2217 >\n1 and NG <1). These classification criteria were used during the\nspectroscopic runs to lower the contamination due to faint and\nred stars to values below \u223c 10% (Halliday et al. 2004; MilvangJensen et al. 2008), and they are also used below in \u00a7 5.3. The\nquasar classification was not considered for the spectroscopic\npreselection. Johnson et al. (2006) used this classification to\nidentify possible AGNs detected in X-rays in these fields.\n3.2. Photometric classification of galaxies\n\nGalaxies were classified into five different spectral types, corresponding to their rest-frame photometric SED: (1) E/S0, (2)\nSbc, (3) Scd, (4) Im, and (5) SB (starbursts). These types correspond to the simplest empirical templates given above, namely\nthe four SEDs compiled by CWW for the local galaxies, plus the\nKinney starbursts. This classification corresponds to the best fit\ntemplates for the GR code. In the case of Hyperz, it is the best fit\nof the rest-frame SED at z phot . The classification obtained with\nthe two codes is in perfect agreement, excepted for catastrophic\nidentifications. We use this classification in \u00a7 4 to address the\nz phot accuracy as a function of the spectral type.\n3.3. Photometric redshift catalogs\n\nPhotometric redshifts for EDisCS catalogs computed with the\ntwo different codes are publically available from the EDisCS\nwebsite4 .\nEDisCS online catalogs also include an optimized flag for\nthe discrimination between galaxies and stars, based on the combination between the above Hyperz criterion, a similar fit using\nthe GR code (flagGR =1 when the object is well fit as a star) (1),\n4\n\nhttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/ediscs\n\n175\n\n0\n\nFigure 1.

Determination of the photometric redshift\naccuracy\nThe expected accuracy of z phot as a function of redshift depends\nstrongly on the photometric accuracy and the filter set used to\nderive the photometric SEDs. As explained in \u00a7 2 and in White\net al. (2005), we introduced an accurate determination of photometric errors to address the former issue. The filter set used\nby EDisCS contains a relatively small number of filters because\nit was designed originally to cover the relevant wavelength domain in the rest frame of low z\u223c0.5 and high z\u223c0.8 clusters.\nIn particular, they bracketed the 4000 \u00c5 break for the relevant\nredshift intervals, but they were not designed to explore the full\nredshift domain. For this reason, we address the z phot accuracy in\nthree different ways described below. Using simulations, we first\ndetermine the redshift ranges for which we expect a reliable estimate of z phot for the low and high-z filter sets, and the ideal (maximum) accuracy expected from simple SED fitting. Secondly, the\nquality of EDisCS z phot achieved is estimated by direct comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts. In a third subsection, we\ndetermine the z phot accuracy expected for galaxies fainter than\nthe spectroscopic control sample.\n\n\fR.

Expected accuracy from simulations\n\nPhotometric redshift determinations are based on the detection\nof strong spectral features, such as the 4000 \u00c5 break, Lyman\nbreak or strong emission lines. In general, broad-band filters allow only detection of strong breaks and are insensitive to the\npresence of emission lines, apart from when the contribution of\na line to the total flux in a given filter is higher than or simi-\n\nFigure 3.

The botton panel displays a plot of \u03c3(\u2206z/(1+z))\nas a function of redshift for the same filter combinations.\n\nlar to the photometric errors, as happens in the case of AGNs\n(Hatziminaoglou et al. 2000).\nTo determine the redshift domains where a reliable measurement of z phot can be obtained given the filter sets used in the low\nand high-z samples, we completed a series of simulations assuming a homogeneous redshift distribution in the redshift interval\n0 \u2264 z \u2264 2. These simulations were performed using Hyperz related software, and z phot computed with both Hyperz and the GR\ncode, but the results should be representative of the general behavior of pure SED-fitting z phot codes. Synthetic catalogs contain\n105 galaxies within this redshift interval, for each filter set, spanning all the basic spectral types defined in \u00a7 3.2, with uniform\nredshift distribution. Photometric errors in the different filters\nwere assigned following a Gaussian distribution with \u03c3 scaled\nto magnitudes according to \u2206m \u2243 2.5 log[1 + 1/(S /N)], where\nS /N is the signal-to-noise ratio, which is a function of apparent\nmagnitude. Here we used the mean S /N achieved in the different\nfilters for the spectroscopic (bright) sample, i.e. for objects ranging between I=18.5(19.0) and 22.0 in the low-z (high-z) sample,\nand the same settings used for z phot computation on real catalogs.\nIn this way, the results obtained from simulations should be considered to be \"ideal\" but still consistent with those derived in\n\n\f6\n\nR.

Because of the limited scope of these simulations, we do\nnot intend to explore all possible domains of parameter space,\nbut focus instead on studying the main systematics introduced\nby the photometric system.\nFigures 1 and 2 display the photometric versus model redshifts retrieved from BVIK s (low-z sample) and VRIJK s (high-z\nsample), respectively. Figure 3 and Table 1 summarize the quality of z phot in the simulations using Hyperz, within the relevant\nredshift domain. The same results are presented in Table 9 for\nthe GR code.\nSome systematic trends are clearly visible in figures 1, 2 and\n3. The high-z filter combination provides a higher quality and\nsmaller systematic deviations than the low-z one. This trend was\nexpected because of the more complete and contiguous spectral\ncoverage of the high-z set. The lack of an R filter for the low-z\nsample introduces a systematic trend in \u2206z \u223c 0.05-0.08 at z >\u223c 0.3;\nthe highest z phot quality for this sample is expected to be around\n\u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) <\u223c 0.06 at 0.4 \u223c< z <\u223c 0.6, i.e. within the sensitive redshift domain. Because of the lack of B-band photometry for the\nhigh-z sample, the highest quality results are expected at z >\u223c 0.4.\nThis trend is indeed observed in the simulations. However, the\nquality achived for high-z simulated data at z <\u223c 0.4 with Hyperz\nis expected to be overestimated with respect to real data, because\ntemplates and models are drawn from the same parent set. This\nis a general criticism of simulations used in assessing the real-\n\nistic performance of z phot quality. Also z phot quality depends on\nthe spectral type of galaxies. With respect to the average quality presented in Fig. 3 for a uniform distribution of types, early\ntypes exhibit up to a \u223c50% improvement in \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) with\nHyperz in the redshift domains where the filter sets bracket the\n4000 \u00c5 break.\nThe results for the GR code in Table 9 are similar in average\nto Hyperz's ones. The quality tend to be slightly better for the\nbluest spectral types, whereas it is worse for early types. This\ntrend can be explained by the broad paramer space spanned by\nthe simulations, the same used by Hyperz for z phot determinations, as compared to the GR code. The noise for late-type galaxies in Hyperz tend to be dominated by degeneracies, whereas\nthe GR code cannot properly fit highly-reddened E-Sbc galaxies.\nNote that the uniform distribution in redshift and types in these\nsimulations does not represent a realistic population of galaxies.\n4.2. Comparison with spectroscopic redshifts\n\nThe z phot accuracy achieved for EDisCS was estimated by direct comparison with its 1449 spectroscopic redshifts in the\n0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 1 interval (type 1+2). Although spectroscopic targets in our sample were strongly biased in favor of cluster members with z phot within the interval zcluster \u00b1 0.2 (see Halliday et\nal. 2004; Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008, and \u00a7 5.1), the geometri-\n\n\fR.

Only type 1 objects, i.e. objects\nwith secure spectroscopic redshifts, were taken into account. In\nTable 3, systematic deviations and \u03c3z were computed over all\n\n\f8\n\nR.

In the low-z bin, the two clusters\nwith only BVI photometry were excluded from the sample when\ncomputing the average z phot quality over the cluster sample. In\nthe high-z bin, we excluded Cl1122-1136 from the cluster statistics, because of the small number of z spec available in this field.\nOur main result is that there is no significant systematic shift,\nneither in the h\u2206z i \u00b1 \u03c3z nor in the \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) results, with\n\nrespect to the values expected from simulations in \u00a7 4.1, with\nsome field-to-field differences discussed below. The accuracy of\nz phot ranges usually between \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) \u223c 0.05 for Hyperz\nand \u223c 0.06 for GR, both for the low-z and the high-z samples.\nThis result is in good agreement with the highest possible accuracy expected from ideal simulations in the low-z case, it is \u223c\n25% worse than ideal expectations in the high-z case for Hyperz,\n\n\fR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\nand compatible with GR results for late type galaxies (early-type\nerrors were overestimated, as mentioned in Sect. 4.1). The differential trend between low and high-z samples with respect to\nsimulations in both codes can be explained because of the different population of \"bright\" galaxies in these fields, low-z and\nhigh-z samples containing a smaller and larger fraction of latetype galaxies respectively, compared to the uniform average population in simulated data (e.g. De Lucia et al. 2007). This effect\nis clearly seen in Table 4. The fraction of objects lost from (or\nspuriously assigned to) the relevant redshift interval according\nto the definitions given above (l% and g%), is negligible in the\nlow-z sample and typically below 5% for the high-z one.\nTable 4 summarizes the results obtained for the entire low-z\nand high-z samples, for both type 1 (secure) and type 1 + type 2\n(both secure and slightly tentative redshifts) spectroscopic data.\nThe results are similar in both cases. In the high-z bin, z phot accuracy improves slightly when the sample is restricted to the\n0.45 \u2264 z spec \u2264 1 interval, where both Hyperz and GR codes yield\nthe same \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) \u223c 0.052. This effect is easily understood\nbecause at z <\u223c 0.45 the rest-frame 4000 \u00c5 break is found shortward of the V-band filter. Table 4 also summarizes the z phot accuracy achieved for the different spectral types of galaxies in\nthe entire sample, i.e. all type 1, 2 and 3 spectra. Tentative type\n3 galaxies represent less than 2% of the total sample, and the\nresults remain unchanged whith respect to type 1+2. The number of galaxies as a function of the spectral type given in this\ntable correspond to Hyperz. Excepted for catastrophic identifications, the classification obtained with the two codes is in perfect agreement. The lowest quality \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) values are measured as expected for the bluest galaxy types (SB), for both the\nHyperz and GR codes. Early types display the highest quality\nresults with Hyperz, whereas GR code has lower quality results\nfor early types in the high-z sample. This trend may indicate that\nthe CWW templates provide an inappropriate description of the\nSEDs of early types at intermediate redshifts.\nThe comparison between the Hyperz and GR codes, either on\na cluster-by-cluster basis or as a function of the filter combination, yields similar results, even though these codes are based on\ndifferent approaches and have different strengths/weaknesses. In\ngeneral, Hyperz results are found to be of slightly higher accuracy than GR's ones (by <\u223c 20% in \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z))), but both are in\nclose agreement with the expectations under \"ideal\" conditions.\nAn interesting trend is that the quality of both codes is highly\ncorrelated, in the sense that the highest and the lowest quality\nresults (in terms of \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) and systematics) are found for\nthe same clusters. Given the homogeneous photometry of the\nEDisCS project, this trend can hardly be explained by the use of\nan incomplete or imperfect template set (as suggested by Ilbert\net al. 2006), because in such a case we would expect the same\nsystematic behavior in all fields, given a certain filter set, as is\nobserved in \u00a7 4.1 with Hyperz. In contrast, different systematic\ntrends are observed for different clusters, which are then found\nto be almost identical for the two independent z phot codes. This\nbehavior suggests strongly that the origin of the systematics is\nmore likely to be the input photometric catalog rather than the\nz phot codes and templates. In particular, we cannot exclude small\nremaining zero-point shifts in our data, approximately equal to\nor less than \u223c 0.05 magnitudes, because we are limited by the\naccuracy of the stellar templates (see Sect. 2).\nA brief discussion of particular aspects of z phot accuracy in\nthe low-z and high-z samples is given below.\n\n9\n\n4.2.1. Low-z cluster fields\n\nFigure 4 displays a direct comparison between the spectroscopic and the photometric redshifts for the low-z clusters in the\nEDisCS sample. Hyperz was used to derive z phot in this figure,\nbut the results with the GR code are very similar, as discussed\nabove. Error bars in z phot correspond to a 1\u03c3 confidence level in\nthe photometric redshift probability distribution P(z), i.e. to the\n68% confidence level computed through the \u2206\u03c72 increment for a\nsingle parameter (Avni 1976). Figure 16 shows the comparison\nbetween spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the entire\nlow-z sample, obtained with Hyperz and GR codes, as well as\nthe zspec \u2212 zphot distribution.\nThe z phot quality in this sample ranges usually between\n0.04 \u223c< \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) \u223c< 0.07 with both Hyperz and GR codes, with\nsome exceptions. On the one hand, Cl1119-1129 and Cl12381144 were only observed in BVI, which produces lower quality\nz phot and a higher fraction of catastrophic identifications. These\ntwo clusters were not included when deriving the mean values\nin Table 3. On the other hand, Cl1232-1250 was observed in J\nin addition to BVIK, and this provides a more accurate z phot estimate with respect to average with Hyperz, although there is no\nclear improvement with the GR code. Compared to simulations,\nthe systematic trend \u2206z \u223c 0.05-0.08 at z >\u223c 0.3 is far smaller in real\ndata, whereas \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) is in agreement with ideal results.\n4.2.2. High-z cluster fields\n\nFigure 5 displays a direct comparison between the spectroscopic and the photometric redshifts for the high-z clusters in\nthe EDisCS sample. Error bars in z phot correspond to 1\u03c3 confidence level in the photometric redshift probability distribution\nP(z). Figure 17 shows the comparison between spectroscopic\nand photometric redshifts for the whole high-z sample, obtained\nwith Hyperz and GR codes, as well as the zspec \u2212zphot distribution.\nThe z phot quality in this sample usually ranges between\n0.05 \u223c< \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) \u223c< 0.08 with both Hyperz and GR codes, with\nsome exceptions. The statistics in Cl1122-1136 is based on a\nsmall number of spectroscopic redshifts, hence we exclude this\ncluster when deriving the mean values in Table 4. Two out of the\nten clusters in the high-z sample are actually in a redshift range\ntypical of the low-z sample. Indeed, in the case of Cl1037-1243a\nand Cl1138-1133, the low redshift of the cluster implies that Bband photometry is required to ensure that an accurate z phot measurement is achieved, although the quality of their z phot measurements is close to average. As seen in Fig. 5, individual error bars\nare larger in these two fields than in the other high-z clusters.\nCompared to simulations, there is no systematic trend in \u2206z as\nexpected, whereas \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) is in agreement with ideal results.\n\n\f10\n\nTable 3.

Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\n4.3. Expected accuracy for galaxies fainter than the\nspectroscopic sample\n\nWe determine the z phot accuracy expected for galaxies fainter\nthan the spectroscopic control sample used in \u00a7 4.2, i.e. galaxies with magnitudes typically ranging between I=18.5(19.0) and\n22.0 in the low-z (high-z) sample, in particular for the faintest\ngalaxies in the EDisCS sample. The concept is to derive z phot on\na degraded version of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample (in terms of S /N), using the same recipes and\nsettings as the main catalogs. This method was preferred instead\nof simulations because it uses the observed SEDs of the control\nsample instead of an arbitrary mixture of spectral types at a given\nredshift.\nDegradated catalogs were generated from the original (spectroscopic) ones, to reproduce the photometric properties of the\nfaintest galaxies in the EDisCS sample. The mean I magnitude\nwas set to be < I >=24.00(24.5) for the low-z(high-z) cluster fields, corresponding to a S /N \u223c 5. For all the other j filters, magnitudes were scaled according to the original SEDs, i.e.\nkeeping colors unchanged: mnew ( j) = m( j) + [24.0/24.5 \u2212 I]\nPhotometric errors as a function of apparent magnitudes were\nintroduced and assigned as in \u00a7 4.1. In this case, \u2206m2new ( j) =\n[2.5 log[1+1/(S /N)]]2 \u2212\u22062 m( j), where \u2206m( j) is the catalog error\ncorresponding to m( j), and S /N = S /N(m( j))10\u22120.4(mnew ( j)\u2212m( j)) .\nThis procedure conserves globally the colors of galaxies. The\nmain caveat is the fact that this noisy population does not necessarily match the true color distribution of the faintest galaxies\nin the sample. However, it is useful to estimate the degradation\nexpected in z phot accuracy between the brightest and the faintest\ngalaxies because of the lowered S /N. Because z phot quality is\nquite insensitive to spectroscopic quality, we added the type 1 +\ntype 2 spectroscopic catalogs.\nTable 2 and 10 summarize the results obtained for the\nfaintest galaxies using Hyperz and the GR code respectively.\nThese tables can be compared directly with Table 4. The quality of photometric redshifts degrades typically by a factor of two\nin \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) between the brightest (I <\u223c 22) and the faintest\n(I \u223c24-24.5) galaxies in the EDisCS sample. Most of the trends\nobserved in Table 4 for the spectroscopic sample are found in the\nTable 2 for the simulations of the faintest sample, in particular\nthe lack of systematics in \u2206z , and the higher quality results in the\nhigh-z bin. The fraction of catastrophic identifications increases,\nbut remains typically below \u223c 5%. The difference in z phot quality between early and late types is smaller for the faintest galaxy\nsample. In this case, the simulation results with the GR code are\nfound to be of slightly higher accuracy than Hyperz's ones (by\n< 20% in \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z))). In Sect. 6.3, we comment on the impli\u223c\ncations that this results will have for the calculation of membership using the photometric redshifts.\n\n5. Photometric determination of cluster redshifts\n5.1. Spectroscopic sample preselection\n\nBefore the first spectroscopic runs, cluster redshifts were estimated from the first z phot catalogs using Hyperz. Spectroscopic\ntargets were selected mainly to have z phot within the interval\nzcluster \u00b1 0.2, or absolute P(zcluster ) \u2265 0.5, and according to the\nmagnitude selection (see Halliday et al. 2004). Although the results discussed in this Sect. were obtained with Hyperz, they\nshould be representative of the general behavior of all SEDfitting z phot codes.\nThe photometic cluster redshifts were computed from the\nphotometric redshift distribution by comparing the N(z) ob-\n\ntained in the center of the field with the equivalent one over a\nwider region of the same area, obtained under the same conditions from the z phot point of view (same effective exposure time\nand number of filters), and used as a blank field. A real cluster\nor other structure should have appeared as an excess of galaxies in the central region in comparison to the outer parts. In this\nexercise, we considered only objects with NG \u2265 1 i.e. objects\nthat could not be excluded as galaxies without applying a cut\nin magnitude. Figure 6 displays the results found for the different fields.The histograms in this Figure display the difference\nbetween the redshift distribution within a \u223c 140\" radius region\ncentered on the center of the image (Nin (z), black solid line), and\nthe distribution within an outer ring, 140\" \u2264 r \u2264 200\", (Nout (z),\ndashed black lines). Red solid lines show the positive difference\nbetween the two histograms, Nin (z) - Nout (z). Histograms were\nobtained with a \u03b4z = 0.05 sampling step and smoothed with a\n\u03b4z = 0.15 sliding window. This window corresponded approximately to the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the z phot estimate for the faintest\ngalaxies in the catalog.\nWhere there was a distinct peak in Nin (z) - Nout (z) distribution, we used this value to represent the \"cluster redshift\". We\nalso computed 2D number density maps and cluster tomography\n(see \u00a7 5.3 below) to emphasize the reality of the clusters, in particular for the uncertain cases. A summary of these results was\nprovided in White et al. (2005). We note that the efficiency of the\ncluster-finding algorithm could be enhanced if the central region\nwas centered on the cluster centroid instead of the center of the\nimage. This ideal situation could be achieved in wider surveys.\n5.2. Spectroscopic versus photometric cluster redshifts\n\nFigure 6 summarizes the comparison between the z phot and spectroscopic redshifts for the different cluster fields. The photometric cluster redshift can be defined in different ways. Here\nwe have adopted two different definitions, which are reported\nin Table 5: (1) the mean weighted value, computed from the\nexcess peak, and (2) the redshift corresponding to the maximum value in the Nin (z) - Nout (z) histogram. Table 5 provides a\ncomparison between spectroscopic and photometric determinations of cluster redshifts for the low and high-z samples. Cluster\nredshifts in Table 5 and Fig. 6 correspond to the most prominent cluster identification when several clusters were present\nin the field (Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008). Five fields were excluded when computing the systematic deviation and dispersion:\nCl1119-1129 and Cl1238-1144 in the low-z sample, because of\nincomplete photometry; and Cl1122-1136, Cl1037-1243a and\nCl1138-1133 in the high-z sample, the first because of the lack\nof a clear cluster in the field, and the two others because their low\ncluster redshifts implied that B-band photometry was required to\nachieve an accurate z phot (see also Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008).\nWe note however the accurate photometric identification of the\nCl1037-1243a cluster, for which a poor determination was expected.\nIn general, the differences between photometric and spectroscopic values are small, ranging from \u03b4z \u223c0.03-0.04 at highz to \u03b4z \u223c0.05 at low-z. The dispersion is much lower than\nthe approximate cut introduced by the spectroscopic preselection (zcluster \u00b1 0.2). Therefore, there is no reason why a cluster\nshould have been \"missed\" within the relevant redshift interval\ndue to z phot preselection. The systematic trend of lower quality\nin z phot for the low-z sample was expected from the simulations\npresented in \u00a7 4.1, and also observed in the comparison with the\nspectroscopic sample in \u00a7 4.2.\n\n\fR.

Photometric redshift distributions in the EDisCS fields, with the cluster redshift increasing from top to bottom and from\nleft to right, for the low-z and high-z samples (first and second series respectively). The histograms display the following redshift\ndistributions: Nin (z) (black thick solid lines), Nout (z) (thin black lines), and the positive difference between Nin (z) - Nout (z) (lowest\nhistograms, thick red lines). A real cluster or other structure corresponds to a positive excess in the lower (red) histogram. Histograms\nwere obtained with a \u03b4z = 0.05 sampling step, smoothed by a \u03b4z = 0.15 sliding window. Vertical solid and dashed lines indicate the\nspectroscopic and photometric values, respectively, adopted for the cluster redshift. All vertical scales are identical in the number\nof galaxies / \u2206z = 0.05, from N(z)=0 to 100, apart from Cl1216-1201, for which the range is 0 to 115.\n5.3. Cluster tomography\n\nWe present results about cluster tomography along the line-ofsight in the different EDisCS fields. This highlights the capability of z phot in identifying and studying clusters of galaxies in\ndeep photometric surveys.\nA local density estimate was derived at each point in the field\nusing a grid with \u03b4x = \u03b4y =1\". The density estimator was defined, according to the formalism introduced by Dressler (1980),\n2\nto equal \u03a320 = 20/(\u03c0d20\n), where d20 was the projected linear distance to the 20-th closest neighbor. Photometric redshift slices\nof \u2206z = 0.1 were used to cover the redshift range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.4.\nClose neighbors were selected within z phot \u00b10.1, centered on the\nredshift bin. The arbitrary choices of \u03a3n and n=20 were justified\nby the typical richnesses of clusters and the z phot accuracy. We\ntested other values of n ranging between 5 and 20 and achieved\nsimilar results for the cluster detection. Edge effects were corrected by using external fields in the main eight directions (i.e.\nX+, Y+, X-, Y-, X+Y+, X+Y-, X-Y+, X-Y-), containing different realizations of the same z phot slice with xy coordinates ran-\n\ndomly sorted. The density maps were smoothed with a Gaussian\nkernel of \u03c3 =5\".\nFigures 7 and 8 display the projected number density maps\nobtained with this method, for the low and high-z samples, respectively. In these figures, clusters are presented with zcluster increasing from top to bottom. Projected number densities are displayed on a linear scale, for an arbitrary redshift step \u2206z = 0.1,\nwith isopleths corresponding to increasing number density bins,\nequally spaced with \u2206\u03a320 = < \u03a320 >, starting at the mean \u03a320\nwithin the redshift slice. The presence of a cluster along the lineof-sight is clearly seen in most cases, at least in all cases where a\ncluster was clearly detected in the field. We note that the < \u03a320 >\nvalue is affected by the presence of a cluster in the corresponding redshift bin. The most significant contrast in the density map\nis found usually for the zcluster \u00b1 0.1 redshift slice (rightmost column of Fig. 7 and 8). The position of the BCG (White et al.\n2005; Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008; Whiley et al. 2008; displayed\nby a blue cross in these Figures) coincides usually with the maximum contrast in the density map for the most prominent clus-\n\n\f14\n\nR.

Projected number density maps for the low-z sample, for different redshift slices with zcluster increasing from top to bottom.\nProjected number densities are displayed in a linear scale. Isopleths correspond to increasing number density bins with \u2206\u03a320 =\n< \u03a320 >, starting at the mean \u03a320 within the redshift slice. Thick frames highlight the redshift slices encompassing zcluster \u00b1 0.1.\nThe rightmost column displays the density map for the zcluster \u00b1 0.1 redshift slice, where the maximum contrast in the density\npeak is usually reached. The position of the BCG for the most prominent clusters in the field are displayed by a blue cross. For\nCl1059-1253, Cl1202-1224, and Cl1119-1129, only two isopleths are displayed corresponding to 1 and 1.5 < \u03a320 >. Additional\noverdensities along the line of sight with detection levels exceeding 4\u03c3 are displayed by circles. High resolution figure available\nat http://www.ast.obs-mip.fr/users/roser/photoz EDISCS/10644f8.pdf\nters in a given field. The comparison between this maximumcontrast slice and the tomography with fixed arbitrary step (e.g.\n\u2206z = 0.1, the step used in Fig. 7 and 8) suggests that the optimal redshift step for detection of clusters along the line-of-sight\nshould be close to the typical difference between photometric\nand spectroscopic zcluster , in this case \u2206z \u223c 0.05. Structures separated by less than \u2206z \u223c 0.05 in redshift space cannot be distinguished by z phot tomography (e.g. clusters Cl1138 (z=0.48) and\nCl1138a (z=0.45) in the 1138.2-1133 field, and Cl1227 (z=0.63)\nand Cl1227a (z=0.58) in the 1227.9-1138 field; Milvang-Jensen\net al. 2008).\nFor all clusters clearly identifiable in this sample (i.e. all\nclusters except Cl1059-1253, Cl1202-1224 and Cl1119-1129),\nthe maximum contrast is found to be at least \u223c 3 \u2212 4\u00d7 < \u03a320 >\nabout zcluster \u00b10.1. All clusters in our sample exhibit a significant\n& 3\u03c3 overdensity around zcluster \u00b10.1, defined to be \u03a320 \u2212 < \u03a320 >\n/\u03c3(z), where \u03c3(z) represents the standard deviation in the pro-\n\njected number density within the redshift bin. For all apart from\nthe three aforementioned clusters, the detection level exceeds\n4\u03c3, and ranges between 6 and 9\u03c3 for Cl1216-1201, Cl12271138, Cl1411-1148, Cl1420-1236, Cl1040-1155, Cl1054-1245,\nCl1138-1133, Cl1018-1211, and Cl1054-1146. No other significant overdensities are found along the line-of-sight of density\npeaks exceeding 3\u00d7 < \u03a320 >, which are typical values for rich\nclusters in this sample. However, several overdensities are found\nwith slightly smaller values, around \u223c 2 \u2212 3\u00d7 < \u03a320 >, and detection levels exceeding 4\u03c3. These structures are identified by\ncircles in Figures 7 and 8 (see below). Their reliability is difficult to assess with the presently available data.\nSeveral fields deserve further comment. More information\nconcerning the spectroscopic identification of clusters in these\nfields can be found in the reference papers by Halliday et al.\n(2004) and Milvang-Jensen et al. (2008):\n\n\fR.

The two components\nCl1103a (z =0.626) and Cl1103b (z =0.703) can hardly be\nseparated by tomography.\n\u2013 Other secondary peaks at z\u223c 0.9 \u2212 1.1 are seen in the\nN(z phot ) distribution of Cl1018-1211, Cl1301-1139, Cl14201236, Cl1054-1245, and Cl1040-1155 (Fig. 6). All can be\nassociated with spatial overdensities of 2 \u2212 3 < \u03a320 > at the\n\n4 \u2212 5\u03c3 level, apart from in the field of Cl1040-1155, where\nno significant overdensity is found.\n\u2013 Several additional overdensities/structures at z\u223c 0.8 \u2212 1.0\nare found in Cl1411-1148, Cl1119-1129, Cl1238-1144, and\nCl1216-1201, with 2\u22123 < \u03a320 > and detection levels ranging\nbetween 4 and 6 \u03c3. Given the limited photometric coverage\nof Cl1119-1129 and Cl1238-1144, the detected overdensities\nin these fields are rather dubious.\n\n6. Cluster membership criteria\nThe most unambiguous way to determine cluster membership is\nby means of accurate spectroscopic redshifts. Unfortunately, it is\nfar too time-consuming to obtain high spectroscopic completeness in cluster member observations, even to relatively bright\nlimits of I < 22 \u2212 23. For this reason, it is necessary to develop membership criteria that rely solely on photometric data.\nTo achieve many EDisCS science goals, such as study of luminosity functions and cluster substructure, any method should: 1)\nretain >90% of cluster members, 2) reject an optimal number of\nnon-members, and 3) measure a probability that a given galaxy is\na cluster member. The first two criteria should be implemented\n\n\f16\n\nR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\nTable 5.

Clusters labeled with 1 were excluded\nwhen computing the systematic deviation and dispersion (see text).\n\nso that there is little dependence on the galaxy color, e.g. for\nButcher-Oemler-type studies. While traditional methods of statistical subtraction using \"field\" surveys of comparable depth offer a viable method to satisfy the first two criteria, they do not\nsatisfy the third. For this reason, we developed an alternative\nmethod for membership determination based on our photometric redshifts estimates.\nWe present below how we use the photometric redshift probability distribution P(z) to reject non-members from each cluster\nfield. We describe the method that we developed and its calibration based on EDisCS spectroscopic redshifts. We discuss\nhow this method can be extended to the entire magnitude-limited\nsample for a given cluster and outline its limitations.\n6.1. The method\n\nTraditionally, z phot \u2013based methods for determining cluster membership were based on a simple cut in redshift, such that a galaxy\nwas considered to be a member if |z phot \u2212 zclust | < \u2206zthresh . One\ndisadvantage of this method is that \u2206zthresh can be as high as 0.3\n(e.g. Toft et al. 2004), causing considerable field contamination\nto enter into the cluster sample. An additional disadvantage of\n\nthe method is that it uses only the best-fit redshift in determining\nmembership and ignores the information contained in the full\nredshift probability distribution P(z).\nBrunner & Lubin (2000) suggested an improved technique\nthat used P(z) in determining galaxy membership. They assumed\na Gaussian P(z) of width calculated from the comparison with\nz spec , and defined the quantity\nPclust =\n\nZ\n\nzclust +\u2206z/2\n\nP(z)dz,\n\n(1)\n\nzclust \u2212\u2206z/2\n\nwhere \u2206z was an interval defined around zclust that reflected\nthe dispersion in the z phot versus z spec diagram, and zclust was the\nspectroscopic redshift of the cluster. In Section 6.2 we explain in\ndetail the method we used to calibrate a threshold value for Pclust ,\nPthresh , below which a galaxy would be considered to be a nonmember. However, in reality, P(z) can be highly non-Gaussian,\nwith multiple maxima and extended tails at large distances from\nthe most likely solution. For this reason, it may not be optimal to\nassume the Gaussian approximation. We therefore extended the\nBrunner & Lubin method to use the full P(z) dataset calculated\ndirectly from the two z phot codes. We tested the accuracy of our\nP(z) by comparing the confidence intervals derived from P(z)\nwith the disagreement between z spec and z phot (see Figures 4 to\n17 in \u00a7 4). The z spec fell within the 68% confidence limits on\nz phot for \u223c 68% of the galaxies and many of the galaxies with\nlarge |z phot \u2212z spec | also had correspondingly large 68% confidence\nintervals. This gave us assurance that P(z) was accurate enough\nfor our purposes.\n6.2. Calibrating from the spectroscopic sample\n\nWe adopt the large and uniform EDisCS spectroscopic sample\n(Halliday et al. 2004; Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008) to calibrate\nthe Pthresh that we use to reject non-members.\nWe show in Figures 9 and 10 the Pclust versus z phot -zclust\nfor all galaxies with secure z spec measurements in our clusters,\nfor the low and high redshift samples, respectively. Results presented here were obtained for the GR code, but they are similar\nfor Hyperz. As seen in Section 4, the z phot accuracy as well as\nthe fraction of catastrophic identifications in a given field depend\non the spectral type of galaxies, although the difference between\nearly and late types is smaller for the faintest galaxies in our sample. Therefore, we have studied the reliability of the membership\ncriteria for both early and late SED types using a cut in the restframe color which splits the sample into two equal halves of red\n(early) and blue (late) type galaxies. The color cuts are found to\nbe (B \u2212 V)rest =0.79 and 0.67 for the low-z and high-z samples\nrespectively. The left and right-hand panels in Figures 9 and 10\nprovide results for objects of different spectral types.\nWe note that the ratio of members to non-members increases\nas a function of Pclust . There are also few galaxies with z phot\n\u2248z spec and very low Pclust values. This implies that there are not\nmany members that would be rejected because their faint magnitudes correspond to broad P(z) and lead to their rejection even if\nz phot \u2248z spec . It is important to consider, however, that the spectroscopic sample consists of the brightest galaxies of probably the\ntightest P(z) values and that this behavior might not be similar at\nfainter magnitudes (see \u00a7 6.3).\nFor the GR code, Figures 11 and 12 demonstrate how the\nretained fraction of members and rejected fraction of nonmembers depends on the Pclust threshold Pthresh for the low-z and\nhigh-z samples, respectively. In both cases, it is possible to define a Pthresh value such that >90% of confirmed cluster members\n\n\fR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\nFigure 9.

In\nFigs. 18 and 19, we plot Pclust (GR) versus Pclust (Hyperz). While\nthere is a large scatter, there is a definite correlation between\nthe two probabilities, such that the majority of objects with\nlow Pclust for one code also have a low Pclust with the other\ncode. A Spearman's Rank Correlation test on the distribution\nof Pclust (GR) vs. Pclust (Hyperz) shows that there is higher than\n99.9% probability that these two variables are correlated. The\nsame result is found for the low and high-z samples, when using the full magnitude-limited samples or other subsamples restricted to the brightest galaxies. This implies that a joint rejection is feasible. After extensive tests, we decided to reject\ngalaxies if Pclust <Pthresh for either code; in these tests, the Pthresh\nvalues for each code were determined separately, such that the\nhighest rejection, independent of rest-frame color, was possible,\nwhile retaining >90% of the confirmed members. The adopted\nthresholds are summarized in Table 6 and the performance of\nthese thresholds is summarized in Table 7.\n\nFigure 11.

To calibrate Pthresh\nfor galaxies without NIR data, we re-derived z phot for the entire spectroscopic sample, excluding the NIR filters. We recalibrate Pthresh and summarize the performance and adopted cuts\nin Table 6 and 7. It is important to note that the performance of\nthe rejection is different in areas with and without NIR data and\nthe retained member population differs in the two regions. For\nthis reason, we limit all studies using the photometric redshifts\nto those areas with NIR data.\nWe checked how the effectiveness of the adopted Pthresh varied across the sample. Because of the limited numbers of spectroscopically observed objects per cluster, this was not possible\non a cluster-by-cluster basis. Instead we split each of the high-z\nand low-z samples into two subsamples each and examined how\nthe accepted and rejected fractions differed. The retained fractions of members ranges from 87\u201398% and the rejected fractions\nof non-members ranges from 50\u201360%.\n\nFigure 13. The apparent magnitude histograms for the spectroscopic sample (solid blue histogram) versus the total sample of\nthe same limiting magnitude (open black). For both samples at\nlow-z (a and b) and high-z (c and d), two of the clusters with the\nmost complete spectroscopic coverage are displayed. We note\nthat the spectroscopic sample, even for clusters with the most\nextensive spectroscopy, is not complete at any magnitude limit\nand is biased towards brighter magnitudes. The magnitudes correspond to the I-band AUTO magnitudes from SExtractor.\n\n6.3. Pclust Threshold Performance in Magnitude Limited\nSamples\n\nWe examine how applicable our adopted Pthresh , calibrated using the spectroscopic subsample, is to the full magnitude-limited\nsample. In Fig. 13, we show the apparent magnitude distribution\nof the spectroscopic sample and the total photometric sample\nwith the same magnitude limit, for two clusters in each redshift\nrange with the widest spectroscopic coverage. It is clear from\nthese plots that we are not spectroscopically complete at any\nmagnitude and that the spectroscopic sample, as expected, is biased towards brighter magnitudes.\nThe spectroscopic target lists were not only constructed with\na magnitude limit in mind, but also with an eye towards reducing\nthe number of galaxies that had low probabilities of being at the\ncluster redshift, in addition to including some galaxies that were\nnot formally present about zclust . We examine in general how this\npreselection causes the Pclust distributions of the spectroscopic\nsample to differ from those in a magnitude-limited photometric sample. In Fig. 20, we compare the histogram of the Pclust\nvalues for the spectroscopic samples with those for the entire\nsample down to the same magnitude limits. The spectroscopic\npreselection manifests itself as an excess of high Pclust values\nand a deficit of low Pclust for the spectroscopic sample with respect to the photometric sample. Within the precision of our numerical routine, a KS-test gives 0% probability that these two\ndistributions are drawn from the same parent distribution. This\ninherent bias implies that a certain Pthresh removes a higher frac-\n\n\fR. Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\ntion of galaxies in the photometric sample than was the case in\nthe spectroscopic subsample.\nWe examine how the spectroscopically calibrated Pclust rejection operates when applied to a magnitude-limited sample.\nWe illustrate these results using the GR code, but the conclusions\nwould be equivalent using Hyperz. In Figs. 14, 21, 15, and 22, we\nplot the Pclust versus z phot for two high-z and two low-z clusters.\nEach figure has panels that show how this distribution changes\nwith apparent magnitude. As we move to fainter magnitude limits, many galaxies appear at all Pclust values. Those at high Pclust\ndo indeed fall close to zclust , as predicted by the spectroscopic\nstudies. Encouragingly, the galaxies with low Pclust values fall\nsystematically away from zclust . In fact, even at the faintest magnitudes, there are very few galaxies within zclust \u00b10.1 that have\nPclust < 0.2. We recall that this must not be the case: galaxies\nwith z phot \u2248zclust but broad P(z) distributions will have low probabilities of being at the cluster redshift, even though their best\nvalue lies around zclust . This self-consistency implies that Pclust\nis, in fact, providing us with a real indication of whether these\nfaint objects are at the cluster redshift. This effect would be difficult to reproduce by systematic errors in the photometric redshifts because it appears for all clusters, regardless of their redshift range or presence of NIR data. Nonetheless, there are some\nfaint galaxies with z phot \u223c zclust that may be rejected because of\na broad P(z). Also, the tests presented in Sect. 4.3 demonstrate\nthat the photometric redshift accuracy is expected to be lower\nfor fainter galaxies, implying that there will be galaxies who are\ntruly at zcluster but are scattered away from the cluster redshift.\nIn Rudnick et al. 2009, we discuss how these effects may differ\nfor red and blue galaxies and we present the implications for the\nstudy of the cluster galaxy luminosity function.\nThe total fraction of galaxies rejected for each cluster as a\nfunction of I magnitude are presented in the columns 3-6 of\nTable 8. When our rejection criteria is applied, we reject 55-82%\nof the galaxies at I < 22 and 75-93% at I < 24.5.\n\nFigure 14.

Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS\n\n7. Discussion and Conclusions\nWe have used two independent codes to compute photometric redshifts: Hyperz and GR code. In general, the two codes\nyield rather similar results, either on a cluster-by-cluster basis\nor as a function of the filter set and spectral type, of typically\n\u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)) \u223c 0.05 to 0.06. Hyperz results are found to be\nslightly more accurate than GR's ones in general, by <\u223c 20% in\n\u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)). The quality achieved by both codes is consistent\nwith the expectations derived from \"ideal\" simulations. An interesting trend is that the quality of both codes is highly correlated, in the sense that the highest and lowest quality results, in\nterms of \u03c3(\u2206z/(1 + z)), and systematics are found for the same\nclusters. This trend cannot be due to the use of an incomplete\nor imperfect template set, as suggested by other authors (Ilbert\net al. 2006), because in such a case, we should expect the same\nsystematic behavior in all fields, given a filter set, as discussed\nin \u00a7 4.1. In contrast, different systematics are observed in the\ndifferent fields, which are found to be almost equal for the two\nindependent z phot codes. This behavior suggests that the origin of\nthe systematic errors is more likely to be associated with small\nresiduals in the input photometry rather than the z phot templates\nand codes. Indeed, small zero-point shifts of <\u223c 0.05 magnitudes\ncannot be excluded, in particular for the near-IR data.\nPhotometric redshifts are found to be particularly useful in\nthe identification and study of galaxy clusters in large surveys.\nThe determination of cluster redshifts in the EDisCS fields using a simple algorithm based on z phot is highly accurate. Indeed,\nthe differences between photometric and spectroscopic values\nare found to be small, typically ranging between \u03b4z \u223c0.03-0.04\nin the high-z sample and \u03b4z \u223c0.05 in the low-z sample. This\nis at least a factor \u223c (1 + z) more accurate than the determination of z phot for individual galaxies. The accuracy is more sensitive to the filter set used rather than the redshift of the cluster. The systematic lower quality results for the low-z sample\nwas somewhat expected from the simulations presented in \u00a7 4.1.\nTomography based on z phot could be used in searches for clusters along the line-of-sight, using redshift steps optimized to be\nclose in value to the typical difference between photometric and\nspectroscopic zcluster to maximize the contrast between members\nand non-member galaxies (in this case, \u2206z \u223c 0.05).\nThe cluster membership criterion presented in Sect. 6 has\nbeen used to extend the spectroscopic studies of cluster galaxies\nto fainter limits in magnitude (e.g. De Lucia et al. 2004, White\net al. 2005, Clowe et al. 2006, Poggianti et al. 2006, De Lucia et\nal. 2007, Desai et al. 2007, Rudnick et al. 2009).\nIn conclusion, photometric redshifts are useful tools for\nstudying galaxy clusters. They enable efficient and complete\npre-selection of cluster members for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the cluster redshifts based on photometry\nalone, provide a means of determining cluster membership, especially for bright sources, and can be used to search for galaxy\nclusters.\nAcknowledgements.

Pell\u00f3 et al.: Photometric Redshifts and cluster tomography in EDisCS, Online Material p 4\n\nFigure 18. A comparison of Pclust computed by the two different photometric redshift codes for the clusters with BVIK photometry.\nThe black open circles represent all galaxies with I < 24.5. The solid red squares are spectroscopically confirmed members and the\nsolid green triangles are spectroscopically confirmed non-members. There is a broad correlation of Pclust between the two codes,\nsuch that the overwhelming number of galaxies have low Pclust for both methods with a smooth distribution of higher Pclust galaxies\nextending to the upper right, coincident with the confirmed members. The blue lines indicate the Pthresh values for each code that\nwere determined to reject jointly the largest number of non-members, while retaining at least 90% of the confirmed members.\nObjects to the left of the vertical blue line or beneath the horizontal blue line are flagged as interlopers.\n\nFigure 19.
