One of the fundamental results in this field is\nthe Fluctuation-dissipation Theorem (FdT), which was\noriginally formulated by Callen and Welton in 1951 [1].\nSeveral different formulations of the FdT have been introduced since then, see [2] for a review. In this short\npaper we develop a formulation which is suitable for calculating the spectra S\u03b4T\n\u02c6 (\u03c9) of thermal fluctuations of\ntemperature-dependent quantities of the form\nZ\n\u02c6\n\u03b4T = d3~r\u03b4T (~r, t)q(~r).\n(1)\nHere \u03b4T (~r, t) is the local temperature at location ~r and\ntime t, and q(~r) is an arbitrary function.\nComputations of this kind may be relevant for the design of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like\nthe Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). Random thermal fluctuations are expected\nto be the dominant noise source for LIGO at frequencies\nbetween 10 and 100 Hz; see, e.g., [3]. This noise is mostly\ndue to the thermal motion of the LIGO mirror surfaces,\nand has been extensively studied both theoretically and\nexperimentally by several groups around the world; see,\ne.g., [4] and references therein. More recently Braginsky,\nGorodetsky, and Vyatchanin ([5], hereafter BGV) have\nidentified a different kind of thermal noise, which they\ncalled the thermo-refractive (TR) noise. The TR noise\ncan be understood as follows:\nConsider a laser beam which passes through (the part\nof) one of LIGO test masses. The index of refraction of the test-mass material is strongly temperaturedependent. Thus local thermodynamical fluctuation in\nthe temperature \u03b4T (~r) result in the fluctuation of the\noverall phase of the laser beam, as measured by an interferometric experiment. For small expected temperature\nfluctuations, the variation of the phase is of the same\nform as in Eq. (1). Thus a computation of the thermo\u02c6.\nrefractive noise amounts to that of the fluctuations in \u03b4T\nBGV have computed the TR noise for a plane-parallel\ngeometry of the thin mirror coating. Their computation\n\nwas based on the multi-dimensional Langevin equations\nand involved a calculation of the spacial temperature correlation functions. While BGV approach works fine for\nsimple geometries, it becomes numerically cumbersome\nin more general geometries, i.e. in a case when the light\ngoes through one of the test masses and the light-beam\nradius is comparable to that of the test mass.\nBy contrast, our computational approach will be based\non a direct application of the FdT, in the spirit of our\nearlier treatment of the mechanical thermal noise ([6],\nhereafter L98). We will show that in order to compute\nthe fluctuations in T\u0302 , one needs to perform the following\nmental experiment consisting of 3 steps:\n1. Periodically inject entropy into the medium, with\nthe volume density of the entropy injection given by\n\u03b4s(~r)\n= F0 cos(\u03c9t)q(~r),\ndV\n\n(2)\n\nwhere F0 is an arbitrarily small constant.\n2. Track all thermal relaxation processes in the system\n(e.g., the heat exchange between different parts of the\nsystem) which occur as a result of the periodic entropy\ninjection. Calculate the total entropy production rate\nand hence the total dissipated power Wdiss which occurs\nas a result of the thermal relaxation.\n\u02c6\n3. Evaluate the spectral density of fluctuations in \u03b4T\nvia the formula below:\nS\u03b4T\n\u02c6 (f ) =\n\n8kB T Wdiss\n;\n\u03c9 2 F02\n\n(3)\n\ncf. Eq. (1) of L98. Here \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f .\nIn the following section we give a proof of the above\nprescription. In section 3, as an illustration of the\nmethod, we compute the thermo-refractive coating noise\nin the BGV geometry. We conclude with some brief general discussion in section 4.\n\nII.\n\nPROOF\n\nIt may well be possible to verify Eq. (3) by appealing to one of the existing formulations of the FdT, which\n\n\f2\ntreat the fluctuations of generalized thermodynamic variable (see [2]). However, the gravitational-wave community (including this author) is much more familiar with\nthe FdT for a generalized mechanical coordinate of the\nsystem, as given by Callen and Welton in 1951 [1]. We\nthus think it is instructive to construct a proof of Eq. (3)\nusing a mechanical coordinate.\nFor this, we mentally introduce a set of non-intrusive\nmechanical thermometers into the system. Our thermometers are localized ensembles of identical harmonic\noscillators, which are assumed to\n(a) be sufficiently densely packed into the system (we will\nmake this more precise shortly),\n(b) have total mass and heat capacity which are vanishingly small compared with those of the original system\n(for the latter it is sufficient to assume that the number\nof thermometers is much smaller than the number of particles in the system),\n(c) have a proper angular frequency \u03c90 which is much\nhigher than the angular frequencies 2\u03c0f at which S\u03b4T\n\u02c6 (f )\nis computed, and\n(d) be thermally coupled to the system on a timescale\nmuch shorter than 1/f .\nConsider now an operator\nT\u03021 = \u03a3i x2i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere xi is the displacement of the i'th oscillator. For\ndensely packed oscillators, the equation above can be\nwritten as\nZ\nT\u03021 = d3 rn(~r) < x2 (~r) >,\n(5)\nwhere n(~r) is the spacial density of the oscillators, and\n< x2 (~r) > is the average x2 at a radius ~r. Note that as\nthe number of oscillators increases, the Eq. (5) becomes\nbetter defined and more precise. For sufficiently dense\npacking,\nkB\n< x (~r) >=\nT (~r),\nm\u03c902\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, and m is the oscillator mass. Here, when we say \"sufficiently dense\", we\nmean that in a minimum volume for which the notion\nof local temperature T (~r) is meaningful, there should\nbe a number of oscillators \u226b 1. If such volume has\nN1 \u226b 1 particles, then it should have N2 oscillators\nwhere N1 \u226b N2 \u226b 1.\nWe now choose the density of the oscillators be\nn(~r) =\n\nm\u03c902\nq(~r),\nkB\n\n(7)\n\nwhere q(~r) is the form factor from Eq. (1); we can always\nrescale q(~r) so that the oscillators are sufficiently densely\npacked. With this choice of n(~r), the dynamical variable\nT\u03021 closely tracks the thermodynamical variable T\u0302 .\nWe can now use the Callen-Welton formulation of\nthe FdT to find the fluctuation ST\u0302 (f ) in T\u03021 . We follow\n\nclosely the steps described in L98:\nStep 1. We introduce a periodic perturbation of the\nform of the interaction Hamiltonian\nHint = \u2212F0 cos(2\u03c0f t)T\u03021 ,\n\n(8)\n\nand consider response of the system to this perturbation.\nFrom Eq. (4) we see that physically such perturbation\namounts to a periodic change in the rigidity of each of\nthe oscillator, or, equivalently, in a periodic change \u03b4\u03c90\nin the oscillator proper frequency:\n\u03b4\u03c90\nF0 cos(2\u03c0f t)\n=\n.\n\u03c90\nm\u03c902\n\n(9)\n\nIf the oscillators were not thermally coupled to the system, their energy would track adiabatically the change in\nthe proper frequency, \u03b4E/E = \u03b4\u03c90 /\u03c90 . Once the thermal\ncoupling is included, their energy change is given by\n\u03b4\u03c90\n\u03b4Qi\n\u03b4Ei\n=\n\u2212\n,\nEi\n\u03c90\nEi\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b4Qi is the energy input from the i'th oscillator to\nthe local thermal bath. By construction the oscillators'\nthermal coupling to the system is much more rapid than\n1/f , and thus on average their energy does not change (it\nremains kB T ). Therefore, once averaged over the local\nvolume dV , Eq. (10) gives\n\u03b4Q =\n\nF0 cos(2\u03c0f t)\n\u00d7 kB T n(~r) \u00d7 dV.\nm\u03c902\n\n(11)\n\nWe now substitute Eq. (7) into the above equation, and\nget\n\u03b4s\n1 \u03b4Q\n=\n= F0 cos(2\u03c0f t)q(~r).\ndV\nT dV\n\n(12)\n\nThis is the density of the local entropy injection as a\nresult of the periodic perturbation driven by Hint .\nStep 2. We compute the total power Wdiss which\nis dissipated in the system as a result of the periodic\nforcing. This means that we compute the total entropy\nproduction in the system; from Eq. (12) we see that it is\nzero to first order in F0 . Not so to the second order: the\nentropy injection leads to temperature inhomogeneities\nwhich in turn lead to thermal relaxation processes, i.e.\nto the heat exchange between different parts of the\nsystem. The thermal relaxation leads to the net entropy\nproduction rate which is second order in F0 .\nStep 3. We compute S\u03b4T\n\u02c6 (f ) by using Eq. (3). This\ncompletes justification for and physical description of the\ncomputational procedure outlined in the introduction. In\nnext section we work out a practical example, as a useful\ncrosscheck of our approach.\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nTHERMO-REFRACTIVE NOISE IN LIGO\nMIRROR COATING\n\nBGV studied the thermo-refractive noise in the thin\noptical coating of LIGO mirrors. We re-derive their result\nusing the direct approach developed above.\nAs BGV have explained, the relevant variable for the\ncoating thermo-refractive fluctuation is\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n2\n2\n2\n\u02c6 = 1\n\u03b4T\ndxdy\ndz\u03b4T (~r, t)e\u2212(x +y )/r0 e\u2212z/l ,\n2\n\u03c0r0 l \u2212\u221e\n0\n(13)\nwhere r0 is the effective beam size, l is the effective coating thickness, x and y are the rectangular coordinates\nalong the mirror face, and z is the coordinate along the\nbeam, chosen so that z = 0 at the coating outside boundary. Within our approach, we need to, as a thought experiment, inject an oscillating entropy perturbation of\nthe form in Eq. (2), where\nq(~r) =\n\n1 \u2212(x2 +y2 )/r02 \u2212z/l\ne\ne\n.\n\u03c0r02 l\n\n(14)\n\nThe heat injection leads to periodic temperature perturbation \u03b4T (~r), which we compute below. We can then\nfind the dissipated power [see Eq. (35.1) of Landau and\nLifshitz [7] and Eq. (5) of [8]]:\nZ\nE\n\u03baD\n(15)\n(\u2207\u03b4T )2 ,\nWdiss = d3 r\nT\nwhere \u03ba is the thermal conductivity, and < ... > stands\nfor averaging over the oscillation period 2\u03c0/\u03c9.\nAs p\nBGV have noted, the thermal diffusion lengthscale\nlth = \u03ba/(C\u03c1\u03c9) satisfies the following inequality:\nr0 \u226b lth \u226b l.\n\n(16)\n\nTherefore, (1) the heat diffusion is almost exclusively in\nthe z direction, and (2) we can consider all of the entropy\nto be injected at the outer coating boundary, with the\nsurface density\n\u03b4s\nF0 cos(\u03c9t) \u2212(x2 +y2 )/r02\ne\n.\n=\ndA\n\u03c0r02\n\n(17)\n\nThe temperature perturbation satisfies the diffusion\nequation\n\u2202 2 \u03b4T\n\u2202\u03b4T\n,\n=D\n\u2202t\n\u2202z 2\nand the boundary condition\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 \u03b4s\n\u2202\u03b4T\n=T\n.\n\u2212\u03ba\n\u2202z z=0\n\u2202t dA\n\nThe latter simply states that all the heat injected at the\nboundary is transported inwards[9]. Here D = \u03ba/(\u03c1C),\nwhere \u03c1 is the density and C is the heat capacity.\nIt is now straightforward to find \u03b4T and its gradient:\n\u0012 r\n\u0013\n\u0012r\n\u0013\n2\n2\n2\nT F0 \u03c9\n\u2202T\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nexp \u2212\n=\nz sin\nz \u2212 \u03c9t e\u2212(x +y )/r0 .\n\u2202z\n\u03ba\u03c0r02\n2D\n2D\n(20)\nWe can now find the dissipated power:\nWdiss \u2243\n\nZ\n\n\u03ba\nd3 r\nT\n\n*\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03b4T\n\u2202z\n\n\u00132 +\n\nF 2 \u03c92T\n= 0 2\n4\u03c0r0 \u03ba\n\nr\n\nD\n.\n2\u03c9\n\n(21)\n\nFinally, from Eq. (3), we get\nS\u03b4T\n\u02c6 (f ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2kB T 2\n\u221a\n.\n\u03c0r02 \u03c9C\u03c1\u03ba\n\n(22)\n\nThis result is identical to Eq. (9) of BGV.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur direct approach to the thermo-refractive noise\nhas 2 advantages, as compared to the previously used\nmethods:\n1. It is computationally easier, especially when the\nform-factor q(~r) is significant over a large fraction of the\nsystem's volume. For example, a broad beam of light\npassing through a LIGO test mass will be sensitive to\nthe thermo-refractive fluctuations in a large fraction of\nthe test mass' volume.\n2. In elucidates geometries and material properties\nwhich may make the thermo-refractive noise high. The\nthermal relaxation which is induced in the process of our\nmental experiment depends on the spacial variation of\nthe form-factor q(~r) and (less obviously) on that of the\nheat capacity.\nFuture work may include unified simultaneous modelling\nof thermo-refractive and thermoelastic noises, since they\nboth originate from T -fluctuations and may be highly\ncorrelated.\n\n(18)\nV.\n\n(19)\n\n[1] H.

However,\none can easily show that diffusion is by far more efficient\nin transporting heat than radiation.\n\n\f"}
