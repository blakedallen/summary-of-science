Massive generalizations of three-dimensional gravity allow propagating degrees\nof freedom. Topologically massive gravity (TMG) is the well-known example obtained by\nincluding a gravitational Chern\u2013Simons term with coupling \u03bc [1, 2]. The model was extended\nby the addition of a cosmological constant term \u039b = \u22121/l2 to cosmological topologically\nmassive gravity (CTMG) [3]. The gravitational Chern\u2013Simons term is odd under parity\nand as a result, the theory shows a single massive propagating degree of freedom of a given\nhelicity, whereas the other helicity mode remains massless. The single massive field is realized\nas a massive scalar \u03c6 = z 3/2 hzz when using the Poincare coordinates x\u00b1 and z covering the\nAdS3 spacetimes [4]. However, it was claimed that the negative-energy massive graviton\ndisappears at the critical point of \u03bcl = 1 [5]. This cosmological topological massive gravity\nat the critical point (CCTMG) may be described by the logarithmic conformal field theory\n(LCFT) [6, 7] even for the zero central charge cL = 0.\nAnother massive generalization of Einstein gravity in three dimensions was proposed recently by adding a specific quadratic curvature term to the Einstein-Hilbert action [8, 9].\nThis term was designed to reproduce the ghost-free Fierz-Pauli action for a massive propagating graviton in the linearized approximation. This gravity theory proposed by Bergshoeff,\nHohm, and Townsend (BHT) became known as new massive gravity (NMG). Unlike the\nTMG, the NMG preserves parity. As a result, the gravitons acquire the same mass for both\nhelicity states, indicating two massive propagating degrees of freedom. It was shown that\nthere is no ghost in the linearized BHT gravity by performing a canonical analysis in flat\nspacetimes [10]. Furthermore, in flat and de Sitter spacetimes, the authors [11] have found\ntwo massive propagating scalars \u03c3 and \u03c6 derived from the metric perturbations, satisfying the\nKlein-Gordon equation [\u22072 \u2212 m2 ]{\u03c3, \u03c6} = 0. However, up to now, there is no explicit form\nof two massive scalars propagating on AdS3 spacetimes, even for the fourth order linearized\nequation for graviton was known under the transverse and traceless gauge [12].\nIt is well known that the BTZ black hole as solution to Einstein gravity with \u039b is also\na black hole solution to the CTMG. However, this does not necessarily imply that there is\nno difference in the dynamics of perturbations. It is obvious that perturbation discriminates\nbetween Einstein gravity and CTMG. Recently, it was shown that the (non-rotating) BTZ\nblack hole is stable for all values of \u03bc against the metric perturbations in the TMG by\nconsidering left-and right-moving normal modes [13]. They have confirmed the stability by\nsolving the massive scalar equation of (\u22072BTZ \u2212 m2 )\u03c6 = 0.\nIn this work, we wish to perform stability analysis on the BTZ black hole in the NMG,\n1\n\n\fwhich is a nontrivial task. The basic idea of performing the black hole stability is that\none decouples the second order linearized equations and then, manages to arrive at the\nSchr\u00f6dinger-type equation with an effective potential for physically propagating fields [14, 15].\nIf all potentials are positive for whole range outside a event horizon, the black hole under the\nconsideration is stable. If an effective potential is not positive definite everywhere outside\na horizon, a special trick called the S-deformation technique may be used to prove the\nstability [16]. It is well known that a practical tool for testing stability of all kinds of black\nholes is a numerical investigation of quasinormal frequencies \u03c9 = \u03c9R \u2212 i\u03c9I by imposing the\nboundary condition: ingoing waves near a event horizon and the Dirichlet boundary condition\nat infinity [17]. That is, the unstable mode is defined by the condition of\n\u03c9R = 0, \u03c9I < 0.\n\n(1)\n\nin quasinormal mode approach [18]. We wish to perform the stability analysis of the BTZ\nblack holes by computing quasinormal modes of the NMG. However, it seems that this\nanalysis is not a straightforward task in the NMG because the linearized equation is a fourth\norder differential equation. If the mass parameter m2 is off the critical value (m2 6= 1/2l2),\nthe fourth order equation split into two second order equations with transverse and traceless\ngauge conditions: one is for a massless graviton (gauge artefact) and the other is for a\nmassive graviton, which takes a similar form obtained from the Fierz-Pauli action. However,\nat the critical point of m2 = 1/2l2 (cL = 0, cR = 0), the fourth order equation leads to\n \u0304 2 \u2212 2\u039b]2 h\u03bc\u03bd = 0, which is difficult to be solved unless the LCFT is introduced. Hence,\n[\u2207\nthis case is surely beyond the standard stability analysis of a black hole prescribed above.\nRecently, Sachs and Solodukhin have determined quasinormal mode of black hole spectrum\nfor tensor perturbations in the TMG [19]. In their operator calculation, they have used\nthe chiral highest weight condition of L\u03041 h\u03bc\u03bd = 0 to derive quasinormal frequencies, which\nare similar to the scalar quasinormal modes. However, this method is inappropriate to\nderive quasinormal modes at the critical point \u03bc = 1/l of the TMG. To this end, Sachs has\ngeneralized the one-to one correspondence between quasinormal modes in the BTZ black hole\nand the poles of the retarded correlators in the boundary conformal field theory to include\nlogarithmic operators [20]. On the other hand, Liu and Wang have studied the stability of\nthe BTZ black string against gravitational perturbations in four dimensions, which is very\nsimilar to the Fierz-Pauli action in three dimensions [21].\nThe organization of our work is as follows. In section 2, we briefly review how the BTZ\nblack hole comes out from the NMG. We derive quasinormal modes of the NMG by solving the\nfirst order equations with \u039b = \u22121, which is based on Sachs and Solodukhin method used in\nthe TMG in section 3. However, the left- and right-moving modes are not orthogonal, which\n2\n\n\fhas a problem to be considered as two independent massive modes. Section 4 is focused on\nderiving quasinormal modes at the critical point of m2 = 1/2 with \u039b = \u22121. We identify two\nmassive modes \u03a6 and \u03a8 from the NMG (Fierz-Pauli action) using the conventional black\nhole stability analysis in section 5. Finally, we discuss similarity and difference in stability\nbetween the TMG and the NMG in section 6.\nWe would like to mention the choice of a cosmological constant \u039b. In general, we choose\n\u039b = \u22121/l2 except section 3 and 4, where it is chosen to be \u039b = \u22121 for the simplicity of\noperator computation.\n\n2\n\nNew massive gravity\n\nThe NMG action [8] composed of the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant \u03bb\nand higher order curvature terms is given by\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nSN M G = SEH + SHC ,\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(3)\nd3 x \u2212g (R \u2212 2\u03bb),\nSEH =\n16\u03c0G\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u221a\n3 2\n1\n(3)\n3\n\u03bc\u03bd\nd x \u2212g R\u03bc\u03bd R \u2212 R ,\nSHC = \u2212\n16\u03c0Gm2\n8\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere G is a three-dimensional Newton's constant and m2 a parameter with mass dimension\n2.

For m2 = 1/2 (the BTZ black\nhole background), the fourth order equation (22) could not be split into the two second order\nequations (23) and (24).\nFirst of all, we consider the AdS3 background [or M = \u22121 in (9)]\nds2AdS3 = \u2212 cosh2 (\u03c1)d\u03c4 2 + sinh2 (\u03c1)d\u03c62 + d\u03c12 ,\n\n(25)\n\none can easily find the solution [5] to (24) as\n\uf8eb\n\n2\n\n3\nhM,AdS\n= e\u2212ihu\u2212ih\u0304v\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\nwhere a and b are given by\na=\n\nsinh (\u03c1) \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n(cosh(\u03c1))h+h\u0304\n\n1\n\nh\u2212h\u0304\n2\n\nh\u2212h\u0304\n2\n\n1\nib\n\nia\n\n\uf8f6\nia\n\uf8f7\nib \uf8f8 ,\n\u2212a2\n\n2\nh \u2212 h\u0304\n, b=\n.\nsinh(2\u03c1)\nsinh(2\u03c1)\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nWe have two sets for h and h\u0304 as primary states\n\u221a\n2 + 2 + 4m2\nh + h\u0304 =\n, h \u2212 h\u0304 = \u00b12,\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u00b1 denote the solution to the first order equations (D M/M\u0303 h)\u03bc\u03bd = 0 with the operators\nin Eq.

In addition, the solution to (23) in the AdS3 background\n(25) has the same form as in (26) when substituting (h, h\u0304) = (2, 0) for left-moving mode and\n(0, 2) for right-moving mode: these are also the solutions to (D L/R hL/R )\u03bc\u03bd = 0, respectively.\nIn this sense, hereafter, we use mainly the first order equations instead of higher order\nequations to find quasinormal modes.

Thus, we have to treat it\nseparately in the next section.\n6\n\n\fOn the other hand, the second order massive equation (24) can be expressed as [24]\n(D M D M\u0303 h)\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(32)\n\nIn order to find quasinormal modes, we have to solve (32) together with the TT gauge (21).\nThis approach was used to derive quasinormal modes in the TMG [19], which shows the\nquasinormal modes of a minimally coupled scalar. We remind the reader that the solution\nto (32) may be a linear combination of two solutions to the first order equations\n \u0304 \u03b1 h\u03b2\u03bd + Mh\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\u2207\n \u0304 \u03b1 h\u03b2\u03bd \u2212 Mh\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n= 0 \u2192 \u01eb\u03bc \u03b1\u03b2 \u2207\n\n(D M h)\u03bc\u03bd = 0 \u2192 \u01eb\u03bc\n(D M\u0303 h)\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\ntogether with the TT gauge (21). Let us first find the right-moving solution to (33).

In order that \u03c9M be a quasinormal mode, hR (M) is required to be positive and\nthus, one has to have M < \u22121. However, it is impossible to make M < \u22121 because M \u2265 1, as\nis shown in (31). Hence it is clear that (40) is not considered as a right-moving quasinormal\nmode for the least damped case.\nThe next step is to find the right-moving solution to (34). This solution is obtained simply\nby replacing M by M\u0303 = \u2212M [equivalently, hR (M) by hR (M\u0303)] in (40) as\n\u2212ik(\u03c4 +\u03c6)\u22122hR (M\u0303 )\u03c4 M\u0303\n\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c1),\nhM\u0303\n\u03bc\u03bd = e\n\n(43)\n\nwhere\n\n1\nM\n\u2212 , M \u2265 1.\n(44)\n2\n2\nIt seems that (43) is regarded as a right-moving quasinormal mode of the least damped case\nwhose quasinormal frequency is given by\nhR (M\u0303 ) =\n\n\u03c9M\u0303 = k \u2212 2ihR (M\u0303 ).\n\n(45)\n\nHence, we could construct the overtone quasinormal modes for this solution. Introducing\nthe operator combination L\u22121 L\u0304\u22121 which replaces \u03c9I by \u03c9I \u2212 2, the nth -overtone quasinormal\nmode is constructed by\n\u0001n M\u0303\n,n\nh\u03bc\u03bd\n(46)\nhM\u0303\n\u03bc\u03bd = L\u22121 L\u0304\u22121\nwhose quasinormal frequency takes the form\nh\ni\nn\n\u03c9M\u0303\n= k \u2212 2i hR (M\u0303 ) + n , n \u2208 Z.\n\n(47)\n\nSimilarly, when imposing the anti-chiral highest weight condition of L1 hM\n\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and thus,\np+ = \u2212ihL (M), the left-moving quasinormal modes to (33) take the form\nn M\nik(\u03c4 \u2212\u03c6)\u22122hL (M )\u03c4\nM\nhM,n\n(L\u22121 L\u0304\u22121 )n \u03c8\u03bc\u03bd\n(\u03c1),\n\u03bc\u03bd = (L\u22121 L\u0304\u22121 ) h\u03bc\u03bd = e\n\n(48)\n\nwhere\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nM\n\u22122hL (M )\nik \uf8ec\n\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c1) = [sinh(\u03c1)]\n[tanh(\u03c1)] \uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\n1\n2\nsinh(2\u03c1)\n\n8\n\n0\n2\nsinh(2\u03c1)\n4\nsinh2 (2\u03c1)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\nM\n\uf8f7\n\u2212 ,\n\uf8f8 , hL (M) =\n2\n2\n\n(49)\n\n\fwhose quasinormal modes are given by\nh\ni\nn\n\u03c9M\n= \u2212k \u2212 2i hL (M) + n , n \u2208 Z.\n\n(50)\n\nM\nWe note that two quasinormal modes hM\u0303\n\u03bc\u03bd and h\u03bc\u03bd are ingoing (the right- and left-moving)\nmodes at the horizon \u03c1 = 0 and are normalizable modes at \u03c1 = \u221e satisfying the Dirichlet\nboundary condition.

In deriving the quasinormal modes, we have used the operator method. As\nfar as this method is concerned, there is no essential difference between TMG and NMG. The\ndifference is that the substitution of M \u2192 \u03bc in (33) is necessary for the TMG and (34) is\nrequired additionally for the NMG because the parity is preserved in the NMG. However, we\nnote that the L/R-moving modes (46) and (48) are not orthogonal to each other even s-mode\n(k = 0) in the NMG because they contain h\u03c1\u03c1 commonly. This gives rise to a significant\ndifference in obtaining the quasinormal modes of the same BTZ black hole between two\nmassive gravity theories.\nM\nFinally, at the chiral point of M = 1, two hM\u0303\n\u03bc\u03bd and h\u03bc\u03bd are no longer n = 0 quasinormal\nmodes because of \u03c9I = 0 (hL/R (1) = 0). Hence, we will treat it in the next section. In\naddition, we mention that requiring both of L\u0304\u22121 h\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and L\u22121 h\u03bc\u03bd = 0 lead to normal\nmodes with ingoing and outgoing fluxes at the event horizon as in Ref. [13], which is not the\ncondition for obtaining quasinormal modes.\n\n9\n\n\f4\n\nQuasinormal modes at the critical point\n\nIn order to see what happens in the perturbation at the critical point (the BTZ black\nhole background), we need to solve the fourth order linearized equation. In this section\nwe choose \u039b = \u22121 for simplicity of operator computation. In general, a mode annihilated\nby D M (D L )[D R ]{(D L )2 but not by D L } is called massive (left-moving) [right-moving] {leftL\nR\nL,new\nlogarithmic (L,new)} and is denoted by hM\n} [25]. Also, a mode annihilated\n\u03bc\u03bd (h\u03bc\u03bd )[h\u03bc\u03bd ]{h\u03bc\u03bd\nby (D R )2 but not by D R is called right-logarithmic mode and is denoted by hR,new\n. Away from\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nthe critical point (m 6= 1/2), the general solution to (29) is obtained by linearly combining\nleft, right, and two massive modes.\nAt the critical point, m2 = 1/2, D M degenerates into D L , while D M\u0303 degenerates into D R .\nThe L/R-moving modes are purely gauge degrees of freedom (unphysical modes), whereas\ntwo massive modes and their logarithmic partners constitute physically propagating bulk\nmodes.

In deriving the\nquasinormal modes at the critical point, we have used the operator method. There is no\nessential difference between TMG and NMG. The difference is that the L-logarithmic mode\napproach is necessary for the TMG, while both of L/R logarithmic approaches are required\nfor the NMG because the parity is preserved in the NMG. However, it is not clear that\ntwo L/R-logarithmic quasinormal modes are orthogonal to each other even for the s-mode\n(k = 0). This is an important issue because the orthogonality may guarantee two independent\nmassive quasinormal modes at the critical point.\n\n5\n\nTwo s-massive modes in NMG\n\nFirst of all, we point out a few problems on the previous tensor quasinormal modes. Their\nfrequencies were constructed as those of a minimally coupled scalar mode. The L/R modes\nof (46) and (48) are not orthogonal to each other even for s-mode (k = 1) because they\ncontain h\u03c1\u03c1 commonly. Hence, we did not confirm that the L/R-moving modes are two truly\npropagating modes in the new massive gravity. This asks directly what is the explicit form\n13\n\n\fof two physically massive modes propagating in the BTZ black hole. In this section, we wish\nto identify two massive graviton modes propagating in the BTZ black hole background.\nIn order to perform the stability analysis of massive graviton with 2 DOF, we first recall\nEq. (9) as the BTZ black hole background. In this background the perturbation equations\n(24) can be rewritten as\n#\n\"\n5\u039b\n \u0304 2BTZ h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 m2 +\nh\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n(71)\n\u2207\n2\nThis equation is similar to the Fierz-Pauli massive equation\n\"\n#\n \u0304 2 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 m2 + 2\u039b h\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\u2207\nBTZ\n\n(72)\n\nwhich is derived from Fierz-Pauli action together with the TT gauge. In order to solve (71)\nexplicitly with the TT gauge, we consider the following two distinct perturbing metric ansatz:\nthe type I has two off-diagonal components h0 and h1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\nh0 (r)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(73)\nhI\u03bc\u03bd = \uf8ed 0\n0\nh1 (r) \uf8f8 e\u03c9h t eik\u03c6 ,\nh0 (r) h1 (r)\n0\n\nwhile for the type II, the metric tensor takes the form with four components H0 , H1 , H2 ,\nand H3 as [21]\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nH0 (r) H1 (r)\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(74)\nhII\n0 \uf8f8 e\u03c9h t eik\u03c6 .\n\u03bc\u03bd = \uf8ed H1 (r) H2 (r)\n0\n0\nH3 (r)\n\nAt this stage, we note that the above two choices of (73) and (74) are working only for\ns-mode (k = 0) perturbation. Also, two are orthogonal to each other. In Appendix II, we\nhave shown that k = 0 case leads to two consistent decoupling processes for I and II metric\nperturbations, when solving (71).\nSubstituting Eq. (73) into Eq.

We have derived\nquasinormal modes of the NMG by solving the first order equations, which is based on Sachs\nand Solodukhin method used in the TMG. However, we have observed that the left- and\nright-modes are not orthogonal, which has a problem to be considered as two independent\nmassive modes. Hence, we have identified two massive modes from the NMG (Fierz-Pauli\naction) using the conventional black hole stability analysis. Furthermore, we have obtained\nleft- and right logarithmic quasinormal modes at the critical point of m2 l2 = 1/2 using the\nLCFT.\nWe discuss similarity and difference in stability between the TMG and the NMG. In\nthe case of the TMG, the BTZ black hole is stable for any Chern-Simons coupling constant\n\u03bc > 0 by computing (33) with replacing M by \u03bc, while the stability of the BTZ black hole\nis guaranteed for m2 l2 > 1/2 (M > l) by computing two first order equations (33) and (34).\nIn the TMG approach, the authors [13] have confirmed the stability by using that a single\nmassive scalar of \u03c6 = z 3 hzz satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation in the AdS3 background. On\nthe other hand, the two left- and right-modes of the NMG [(46) and (48)] are not orthogonal\n17\n\n\fto each other, implying that the two are not considered as two independent massive modes\npropagating on the BTZ black hole background. This requires a reanalysis of stability of the\nBTZ black hole in the conventional black hole approach. We have obtained two propagating\ns-massive modes \u03a6 and \u03a8 by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equations (79) and (85) directly, which\nare surely not the Schr\u00f6dinger equations for a massive minimally coupled scalar.\nHowever, the difference between the NMG and the Fierz-Pauli action is just the presence\nof the critical point of m2 l2 = 1/2 (cL = 0, cR = 0), whose equation is given by the fourth\norder linearized equation (52). This point exactly coincides with providing the BTZ black\nhole solution. Actually, there is no definite way to solve this equation. In the strict sense of\nstability of the BTZ black hole in the NMG, we have confined ourselves to solving (52) by\nusing the LCFT technique in section 5. However, this method is very restrictive and thus,\nthere is no definite way to confirm its results at present. Particularly, the s-mode (k = 0)\ncomputation could be easily done to derive the left- and right logarithmic quasinormal modes.\nAt this stage, we would like to comment on how we can apply the stability condition (87)\nof the BTZ black hole in the NMG to the dual CFT whose central charge is given by [8, 24, 27]\n1 i\n3l h\n1\u2212\n.\n(88)\ncL/R =\n2G\n2m2 l2\nIt is well known that the exact agreement is found between the quasinormal frequencies of\nthe BTZ black hole and the location of the poles of the retarded correlation function of the\ncorresponding perturbations in the CFT [28]. This has provided a confirmed test of the\nAdS3 /CFT2 correspondence. If this correspondence is still valid for the NMG, one observes\nfrom (88) that the zero central charge appears at the critical point, while the unitarity of the\nCFT2 would demand the bound of m2 > 1/2l2 due to cL/R > 0. For the non-critical case, we\nfind the stability condition of M > l from (87), which turns out to be the unitarity condition\nfor the CFT2 . In this case, we expect that the quasinormal modes obtained here could be\nderived from the location of the poles of the retarded correlation function of the corresponding\nperturbations in the CFT2 . On the other hand, it seems that the quasinomal modes obtained\nat the critical point of M = l could be found from the retarded correlation function of the\ncorresponding perturbations in the LCFT as was shown in the TMG [20]. Hence, it is clear\nthat the stability condition of BTZ black hole provides the unitarity condition of the dual\n(L)CFT2 .\nFinally, we would like to mention that the linearized higher dimensional critical gravities\nwere recently investigated in the AdS spacetimes [29] but their quasinormal modes are not\nstudied in the AdS-black hole background. The non-unitarity issue of log gravity is not still\nresolved, indicating that the log gravity suffers from the ghost problem.\nConsequently, we have performed the stability analysis of the BTZ black hole in the NMG.\n18\n\n\fIt seems that the BTZ black hole is stable against the metric perturbation by computing\nquasinormal modes and observing two potentials. However, the stability at the critical point\nis not still completely proved because two s-modes [(60) and (65)] and [(62) and (67)] are\nnot orthogonal to each other, respectively.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank I.

However, this corresponds to the null odd-solution\nbecause in this case, we obtain Hr\u03c6 = 0 from (t, \u03c6) equation. Therefore, the s-mode (k = 0)\nsolution is only admitted for type I metric ansatz (73).\nOn the other hand, when focusing on (t, \u03c6) equation and considering type II (even) metric\nansatz (74) with Ht\u03c6 = Hr\u03c6 = 0, equation (t, \u03c6) reduces to\n4ikr(M + \u039br 2)2 Htr = 0.\nUnless k = 0, we obtain Htr = 0. In this case, Htt = 0 is found from t component equation\n \u0304 \u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd = 0. Furthermore, we have Hrr = 0 and H\u03c6\u03c6 = 0 from (t, t) and (r, r) equations.\nof \u2207\nThis corresponds to the null even-solution. So we also have to restrict to the s-mode case. In\nother words, the s-mode case leads to type I and II metric splitting for obtaining two modes\nof a massive graviton.\n\n23\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S. Deser, R. Jackiw and S. Templeton, Phys. Rev.
