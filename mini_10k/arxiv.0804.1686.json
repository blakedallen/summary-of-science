It turns out that\nthe Hawking temperature is proportional to the product of the group d\u03c9/dk and phase \u03c9/k velocities evaluated at the frequency \u03c9 of the outgoing radiation far away, which suggests that Hawking\nradiation is basically a low-energy phenomenon. Nevertheless, a group velocity growing too fast at\nultra-short distances would generate Hawking radiation at ultra-high energies (\"ultra-violet catastrophe\") and hence should not be a realistic model for the microscopic structure of quantum gravity.\nPACS numbers: 04.62.+v, 04.70.Dy, 04.60.-m.\n\nIntroduction In the history of physics, unexplained\ncoincidences were often the precursor of striking discoveries. For example, the limiting propagation velocity derived from the properties of coils and capacitors in tabletop experiments turned out to be strikingly close to the\nspeed of light measured via planetary motion \u2013 which\nguided the unification of these phenomena by the laws\nof electrodynamics and ultimately lead to the theory of\nrelativity. Today, a similar riddle is the question of why\nblack holes seem to behave like thermal objects [1] and\nevaporate by emitting Hawking radiation [2, 3, 4].\nOne way of achieving a better understanding of these\nlinks is to study the origin of the particles in black hole\nevaporation, i.e., the question of where they are created.\nFor example, it has been suggested to resolve the black\nhole \"information paradox\" (i.e., the apparent contradiction between unitarity and the second law of thermodynamics in this system) by encoding information into the\noutgoing Hawking particles. Clearly, this (hidden) encoding mechanism should then occur at the origin of the\nparticles (or on their way to infinity).\nSince the event horizon marks the \"point of no return\", the modes containing the Hawking particles originate from the region very close to the horizon, i.e., from\nvery short wavelengths (gravitational red-shift). However, the origin of the modes is not necessarily the place\nwhere the particles are created.\nIn order to address this problem, we derive Hawking\nradiation in the presence of a very general dispersion relation \u03c9 = ck \u2192 \u03c9 = \u03c9(k) associated to the propagating degrees of freedom. Such a modified dispersion\nrelation is inspired by the analogy to condensed matter, i.e., the sonic black hole analogues (silent or \"dumb\"\nholes), which rely on the quantitative analogy between\nquantum fields in curved space-times and phonons (or\nother quasi-particles) propagating in fluids with a general flow velocity v(t, r), cf. [5, 6]. In this case, the phase\n\u03c9/k and group d\u03c9/dk velocities vary with wavelength\nand thus the dependence of Hawking radiation on the\n\ndispersion relation should show us which wavenumbers\nk are most important for particle creation: The emitted radiation at various frequencies \u03c9 will \"see\" different\nhorizons. The question this paper will try to answer is\nwhat determines the temperature of the radiation emitted at any particular frequency \u03c9. If the temperature\nis determined when the wavelengths are very small, and\nfrequencies large \u2013 i.e., when the horizon first splits the\nincoming wave packet (in its vacuum state) into positive pseudo-norm modes outside the horizon (which will\nturn into the Hawking particles) and negative pseudonorm modes (their infalling partner particles) inside \u2013\nthen one would expect a universal temperature for all\nof the low-frequency modes. On the other hand, if it is\nthe low frequency aspects of the modes which determine\nthe temperature, one might expect the properties of the\nhorizon defined via one of the velocities (phase, group, or\nother) associated with the wave at low frequencies to dictate the temperature (via dv/dr at that horizon location)\nof that mode.\nPrevious analytic calculations were restricted to low\nenergies \u03c9 and a small vicinity of horizon, see, e.g.,\n[7], while numerical studies necessarily involved a given\n(mostly sub-luminal) dispersion relation within a restricted parameter range. In the following, we present\nan analytic derivation of Hawking radiation valid for any\nfrequency \u03c9 and almost arbitrary (spatial) dispersion relations \u03c9(k); the only assumption we make is that the\nblack or \"dumb\" hole should be large, i.e., macroscopic,\nand that the velocity profile of the background flow have\na specific form.\nDispersion relation Since Hawking/\"dumb\"-hole radiation is basically a 1+1 dimensional effect, we consider\nthe Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand-Lema\u0131\u0302tre metric in 1+1 dimensions (~ = c = GN = kB = 1)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = 1 \u2212 v 2 (x) dt2 \u2212 2v(x) dt dx \u2212 dx2 ,\n(1)\nwith the local frame dragging velocity v(x), which corresponds to the flow velocity of the fluid analogue [5].\n\n\f2\nIt determines the position of the horizon via v(x) = \u00b1c\nwhere c is the velocity of the propagating modes, which\nis assumed to be constant and set to unity here. The\npropagation of a massless scalar field \u03a6 in this metric\n(or, equivalently, phonons in the fluid) is governed by\nthe d'Alembertian\n\u0001\n\u2737\u03a6 = (\u2202t + \u2202x v)(\u2202t + v\u2202x ) \u2212 \u2202x2 \u03a6\n= (\u2202t + \u2202x v + \u2202x )(\u2202t + v\u2202x \u2212 \u2202x )\u03a6 .\n\n(2)\n\nDue to the conformal invariance in 1+1 dimensions, the\nleft-moving modes (\u2202t + \u2202x v \u2212 \u2202x )\u03a6 = 0 propagating\nagainst the frame-dragging velocity are decoupled from\nthe right-moving solutions \u03c6 = (\u2202t + \u2202x v \u2212 \u2202x )\u03a6. However, an arbitrary modification of the dispersion relation\nwould not preserve this decoupling in general. The choice\n\u2737h = (\u2202t + \u2202x v)(\u2202t + v\u2202x ) \u2212 h(\u2202x2 ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nfor example, does not factorize for a general function h.\nOn the other hand, if we modify the left and right-moving\nbranch separately with an arbitrary function f via\n\u0001\n\u2737f = \u2202t + \u2202x [1 + v + f (\u2212\u2202x2 )] \u00d7\n\u0001\n(4)\n\u2202t \u2212 [1 \u2212 v + f (\u2212\u2202x2 )]\u2202x ,\n\nthe left-moving modes (\u2202t \u2212 [1 \u2212 v + f (\u2212\u2202x2)]\u2202x )\u03a6 = 0 are\nagain decoupled from the right-moving solutions given by\n\u03c6 = (\u2202t \u2212[1\u2212v+f (\u2212\u2202x2 )]\u2202x )\u03a6. The difference between the\ntwo options (3) and (4) scales with the derivative of v(x)\ncompared with the characteristic scale of the dispersion\nrelation [v(x), f (\u2212\u2202x2 )], which is negligibly small in the\nhydrodynamic limit (which corresponds to the black hole\nbeing large). The coupling occurs at high frequencies\nover long scales (the scale of variation of v) which means\nthe response will be adiabatic and left-moving waves will\nnot convert to right-moving. This is the reason why the\nnumerical simulations using the first option (3) never saw\na mixing between left and right-movers one might expect\nfrom the coupling between the two sets of modes.\nDerivation Even though\np the Schwarzschild metric\ncorresponds to v(x) = \u00b1 2M/x, we consider two different velocity profiles v(x) = \u2212\u03bb/x and v(x) = \u03bax in the\nfollowing, because they admit analytic solutions. The\nlatter of course has no asymptotically flat region, and\ncalling it a black, or \"dumb\", hole is metaphorical. Let\nus first study the case v(x) = \u2212\u03bb/x. After a FourierLaplace transformation with \u2202x \u2192 ik and x \u2192 i\u2202k as\nwell as \u2202t \u2192 \u2212i\u03c9, the left-moving\nsolutions satisfy the\nR\nintegral equation (since \u2202k\u22121 = dk)\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0001\n\u03c9 \u2212 k 1 + i\u03bb\u2202k\u22121 + f (k 2 ) \u03c6\u03c9 (k) = 0 ,\n(5)\n\nwhich can be solved via separation\nof variables and difR\nferentiation \u03c6\u03c9 (k) = exp{\u2212i\u03bb dk \u2032 /g(k \u2032 )}/g(k) with the\nspectral function g(k) = 1 + f (k 2 ) \u2212 \u03c9/k.

In\nthe following, we shall assume the length scale \u03bb on which\nv(x) changes to be very large compared with the typical\nwavenumber of the dispersion relation f (k 2 ) and the frequency \u03c9. In terms of the fluid analogue, this is precisely\nthe hydrodynamic limit \u2013 whereas, for real black holes, is\ncorresponds to demanding that the size of the black hole\nis much larger than the Planck scale. Note, however, that\nwe do not restrict \u03c9 relative to the Planck scale (i.e., \u03c9\ncould be Planckian). Since the exponent in the integral\nabove contains the large numbers x and \u03bb, it is very useful to deform the integration contour into the complex\nplane (assuming that f is an analytic function), where\nthe leading contributions will be determined by singularities and the associated branch cuts as well as saddle\npoints.

The singularities\nof the integrand at g(k) = 0 correspond to solutions of\ndispersion relation far away from the black hole x \u2192 \u221e.\nAssuming simple poles at k\u03b1 only, we may employ the\nresidual expansion\nI\nX c\u03b1\n1\n1\nk\u03b1\ndk\n\u2194 c\u03b1 =\n=\n=\n.

In this case, saddle points\nin Eq. (7) occur outside the horizon x > \u03bb and yield the\nfollowing contributions to the integral in Eq. (6)\ns\nY\n2i\u03c0\n\u2212i\u03bbc\u03b1\n\u00b1\neik\u00b1 x\n(k\u00b1 \u2212 k\u03b1 )\n. (10)\n\u03c6\u03c9 (x) \u2248\n\u2032\n\u03bbg (k\u00b1 )\n\u03b1\n\nIn view of their spatial behavior, these are the positive\n\u2212\n\u03c6+\n\u03c9 and negative \u03c6\u03c9 pseudo-norm in-modes with large\nwavenumbers |k\u00b1 | \u226b \u03c9 and therefore small group velocities, which are swept towards the horizon. After quantizing the field \u03a6, these positive/negative pseudo-norm\nsolutions yield the creation/annihilation operators of the\nin-modes at large k.\nIn order to close the integration contour, we have to\ncircumvent the branch cuts in the upper complex half\nplane I(k) > 0, cf. Fig. 1. In the limit x \u2192 \u221e, the\ncontributions of the branch cuts starting from the singularities k\u03b1 away from the real axis I(k\u03b1 ) > 0 are exponentially suppressed and only the branch cut starting at\nthe real axis I(k\u2217 ) = 0 contributes. This wavenumber\nk\u2217 represents a real solution of the dispersion relation far\naway from the horizon and just corresponds to the outgoing Hawking radiation with frequency \u03c9 > 0. Hence,\nat x \u2192 \u221e, the integral in Eq. (6) corresponding to the\ncontour C> in Fig. 1 yields a superposition of the outgoing Hawking modes with k\u2217 and the large-k in-modes in\n(10) with k\u00b1 . Continuing this solution beyond the horizon x < \u03bb, the saddle points vanish and the integrand in\n(10) decays exponentially in the lower complex half plane\nI(k) < 0. Thus, we deform the integration contour to\nC< , where the main contribution stems from the branch\ncut(s) starting at I(k\u03b1 ) < 0. Again, for large \u03bb, these\ncontributions are exponentially suppressed.\nTherefore, the outgoing Hawking mode with k\u2217 originates entirely from the in-modes in (10). Assuming that\nthe initial quantum state is the ground state of the largek modes in (10) with respect to the freely falling observer,\nthe amount of created particles is then determined by\nthe mixture between these positive and negative pseudonorm solutions with large k contained in the outgoing\nk\u2217 -modes after the immense gravitational red-shift near\nthe horizon. In view of |k\u03b1 | \u226a |k\u00b1 |, the only difference between positive and negative pseudo-norm modes\nis caused by branch cut(s)\n(\n)\nX\n\u03c6+\n\u03c9 (x)\ns\u03b1\n\u2248 exp \u03c0\u03bb\n(11)\n(\u22121) R(c\u03b1 ) ,\n\u03c6\u2212\n\u03c9 (x)\n\u03b1\nwhere (\u22121)s\u03b1 is the sign associated with the direction of\nthe branch cut. Since g(k) is a real function, the singu-\n\nlarities k\u03b1 occur symmetric w.r.t. the real axis k\u03b1 \u2192 k\u03b1\u2217\nand c\u03b1 \u2192 c\u2217\u03b1 . Choosing the branch cuts suitably (see\nFig. 1), the contributions from the symmetric pairs cancel each other and hence only the singularity at the real\naxis k\u2217 = k\u03b1 \u2208 R contributes. Together with the unitarity relation |\u03b1\u03c9 |2 \u2212 |\u03b2\u03c9 |2 = 1, the ratio (11) directly\ndetermines the size of the Bogoliubov coefficients via\n\u2212 2\n|\u03b1\u03c9 /\u03b2\u03c9 |2 = |\u03c6+\n\u03c9 /\u03c6\u03c9 | = exp{\u03c9/T }. Hence we may read\noff the effective Hawking temperature\nTHawking (\u03c9) =\n\nvgr (k\u2217 )vph (k\u2217 )\n.\n2\u03c0\u03bb\n\n(12)\n\nWe observe that the geometric mean of group and phase\nvelocity [8] evaluated at the frequency \u03c9 of the outgoing radiation far away x \u2192 \u221e determines the Hawking\ntemperature [9]. Therefore, the behavior of the dispersion relation at large k is not relevant \u2013 even though the\nHawking radiation originates from large-k modes \u2013 which\nindicates that the Hawking effect is basically a low-energy\nphenomenon. The \u03c9-dependence of the Hawking temperature can be explained by the fact that high-energy\nwave-packets have a different group velocity than those\nat low energy and hence the various modes \"see\" different horizons and thus other values for the surface gravity,\ni.e., velocity gradient dv/dx = \u03bb/x2 \u221d v 2 /\u03bb.\nThis explanation has been confirmed by numerical simulations [9] and can further be supported by considering\nthe second case v(x) = \u03bax, where the velocity gradient \u03ba\nis constant. In this case, Eq. (6) should be replaced by\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\u03c9 (x) = dk k \u2212i\u03c9/\u03ba exp ikx \u2212 i\u03ba dk \u2032 f (k \u20322 ) .(13)\nHence the weight of the branch cut starting at k = 0 is\njust determined by the ratio \u03c9/\u03ba and the Hawking temperature does not depend on \u03c9 at all because all modes\n\"see\" the same surface gravity \u03ba\n\u03ba\n= const .\n(14)\nTHawking =\n2\u03c0\nSuper-luminal case A super-luminal dispersion relation f (k 2 ) can be treated in a completely analogous way.\nAs the only difference, the large-k in-modes determined\nby the saddle points k\u00b1 originate from inside the horizon\nx < \u03bb and thus the contours in the complex plane (C> for\nx > \u03bb and C< for x < \u03bb, cf. Fig. 1) are slightly different.\nIn view of this observation, one might wonder p\nwhether\nthe ansatz v(x) = \u2212\u03bb/x instead of v(x) = \u00b1 2M/x\nis justified. To address this question, let us consider\nthe Schwarzschild geometry in 1+1 dimensions using the\nEddington-Finkelstein coordinates (V, r)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2M\nds2 = 1 \u2212\ndV 2 \u2212 2dV dr .\n(15)\nr\nFor a massless scalar field \u03a6, the wave equation reads\n\u0015 \u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n2M\n2\n+ f (\u2212\u2202r ) \u2202r \u03a6 = 0 , (16)\n2\u2202V \u2202r + \u2202r 1 \u2212\nr\n\n\f4\nwhere we have again included a modification f (k 2 ) of\nthe dispersion relation. Comparison with the previous\nderivation yields completely the same results for the outgoing solutions \u03c6 = \u2202r \u03a6 up to the replacement \u03c9 \u2192 2\u03c9\ndue to the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate t \u2192 V .\nHowever, in the super-luminal case, an additional complication may arise: According to Eqs. (8) and (11),\nthe thermal Boltzmann factor exp{\u03c9/(4T )} determining\nthe amount of created particles with frequency \u03c9 can\nbe recast into the alternative form exp{2\u03c0M k\u2217 /vgr (k\u2217 )}.\nHence, if the group velocity grows slower than linear in\nk, the number of produced particles decreases with energy. However, if vgr (k) rises too fast in some k-region,\nthe amount of created particles drops at low k (where\nvgr = 1) but later increases again! In such an extremal\ncase, the Hawking radiation could contain a large contribution of ultra-high energy particles (\"ultra-violet catastrophe\"). Going a step further and taking the dispersion\nrelation seriously as a model for ultra-high energy deviations from general relativity [10], one would exclude\nsuch a case in view of our observational evidence for the\nexistence of black holes with macroscopic life-times.\nLet us discuss some examples: The dispersion relation \u03c9 2 = k 2 + k 4 which is realized for the sonic blackhole analogues in Bose-Einstein condensates [11], does\nnot generate an \"ultra-violet catastrophe\" and reproduces Hawking's prediction. In\n\u221a contrast, the expressions\n\u03c9 2 = exp{k 2 } \u2212 1 or \u03c9 = k/ 1 \u2212 k 2 grow too fast and\nhence lead to the aforementioned problems [12].\nNote that the condition vgr (k\u2217 ) \u2265 O(M k\u2217 ) for particle creation obtained from the Boltzmann factor precisely marks the break-down of the saddle-point (i.e., geometric optics) approximation. Writing the integrand in\nEq. (6) as G(k) exp{F (k)}, the first-order corrections to\nthe saddle-point expansion scale as G\u2032 /G \u00d7 F (3) /(F \u2032\u2032 )2 ,\nF (4) /(F \u2032\u2032 )2 , and G\u2032\u2032 /(GF \u2032\u2032 ), evaluated at the saddle\npoint F \u2032 = 0. In our case (6), we have F \u2032\u2032 = \u22122iM G\u2032\nand hence inserting vgr (k\u2217 ) \u2265 O(M k\u2217 ) yields \"corrections\" of order one \u2013 i.e., the saddle-point approximation\nfails. Even if the modes started out in their ground state\n(at k\u00b1 ), they get excited (at k\u2217 ) due to the strong gravitational red-shift. Based on these general adiabaticity arguments, one would expect that the main result remains\nvalid even beyond a sole modification of the dispersion\nrelation: If the outgoing Hawking modes originate from\nthe vicinity of the singularity and the spectral properties of quantum gravity change too fast with energy, one\nwould expect a break-down of adiabaticity at short distances resulting in the emission of high-energy particles.\nThis mechanism is not necessarily restricted to a Plancklength vicinity of the singularity since the effective surface gravity \"seen\" by the high-energy modes scales with\n2M/r2 and hence may exceed the Planck temperature\nalready many Planck lengths away from the singularity.\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by the\nEmmy-Noether Programme of the German Research\nFoundation (DFG) under grant # SCHU 1557/1-2,3; as\nwell as the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research;\nand the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\n\u2217\nschuetz@theory.phy.tu-dresden.de\n+\nunruh@physics.ubc.ca\n\n[1] J.
