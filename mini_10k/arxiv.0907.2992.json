Introduction\nQuantum theory allows for correlations that are not possible in any classical stochastic process. The source of such correlations is entanglement\n[1]. Any system with two or more degrees of freedom has the possibility of\nbeing in an entangled state. Entangled states of atom and electromagnetic\nfield in a cavity can be generated in the interaction of a two-level system\nwith an external field. A well studied model of atom-field interaction is the\nJaynes-Cummings (JC) model [2, 3, 4, 5] , wherein the atom is treated as\nan electric-dipole interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. The\nHamiltonian is\n1\n\u0124JC = \u03c9 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u03bd \u03c3\u0302z + \u03bb(\u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 + \u00e2 \u03c3\u0302+ ),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the coupling constant, \u03c9 is the field frequency and \u03bd is the\natomic transition frequency. The operators \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are the annihilation\nand creation operators of the field; \u03c3z is the Pauli matrix, \u03c3\u0302+ and \u03c3\u0302\u2212 are\nthe raising and lowering operators of the atomic states. The ground and the\nexcited states of the atom are represented by |gi and |ei respectively. The\naction of the relevant operators on these states are\n\u03c3\u0302z |ei = |ei, \u03c3\u0302z |gi = \u2212|gi,\n\u03c3\u0302+ |gi = |ei, \u03c3\u0302+ |ei = 0,\n\u03c3\u0302\u2212 |ei = |gi, \u03c3\u0302\u2212 |gi = 0.\nThe first two terms in the Hamiltonian \u0124JC correspond to the energies of\nthe field and the atom respectively. The last term accounts for the atom-field\ninteraction. This model has been used extensively in studying various quantum optical systems. A generalization of this model is useful in analysing\nposition-dependent interaction strength [6, 7, 8]. To account for such a\ndependence, the interaction term is modified to\n\u0124int = \u03bb(f (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2)\u00e2\u03c3\u0302+ + adjoint).\n\n(2)\n\n\u02c6 the\nThe interaction term in the JC model is obtained when f (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2) = I,\n\u2020\nidentity operator. With any other form for f (\u00e2 \u00e2), the model is referred\nas Nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings(NJC) model. The operator-valued function\nf carries information about the position-dependent interaction strength. If\nthe field has nonlinear dependence on the field amplitude, as in the case of\nKerr interaction [9, 10, 11], the Hamiltonian is generalized further to\n1\n\u0124 = \u03c9 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u03bd \u03c3\u0302z + \u03c7\u00e2\u2020 2 \u00e22 + \u03bb(f (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2)\u00e2\u03c3\u0302+ + adjoint).\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u02c6 models the interaction between a field\nThis Hamiltonian, with f (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2) = I,\nin a Kerr medium and a two-level atom. The quadratic term \u00e2\u2020 2 \u00e22 accounts\n2\n\n\ffor the Kerr effect. We consider a special form of f (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2), so chosen that\nthe model\u221aHamiltonian in Eq. (3) is exactly solvable [12, 13]. Choosing\nf (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2) = 1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2, where 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1, the Hamiltonian \u0124 is written as\n1\n\u0124S = \u03c9 K\u0302 \u2020 K\u0302 + \u03bd \u03c3\u0302z + \u03bb(K\u0302 \u2020 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 + adjoint),\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c7 = k\u03c9. The suffix \"S\" indicates that the Hamiltonian describes the\ninteraction of a \u221asingle-mode of a cavity field\n\u221a with a two-level atom. The\noperators K\u0302 = 1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u00e2 and K\u0302 \u2020 = \u00e2\u2020 1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 are deformed annihilation and creation operators respectively. In this work, the parameter k is\ntaken to be nonnegative. Nevertheless, when k = \u22121, the operators K\u0302 and\nK\u0302 \u2020 are the well-known Holstein-Primakoff realization of spin operators. It is\ninteresting to note that when k = 0, the Hamiltonian is the JC Hamiltonian.\nNonzero values of k amount to including Kerr effect and intensity-dependent\ninteractions. In essence, nonlinearity and intensity-dependent interactions\nare included via deformation. The operators K\u0302, K\u0302 \u2020 and K\u03020 = k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + 12\nsatisfy the commutation relations,\n[K\u0302, K\u0302 \u2020 ] = 2K\u03020 , [K\u03020 , K\u0302 \u2020 ] = kK\u0302 \u2020 , [K\u03020 , K\u0302] = \u2212kK\u0302,\n\n(5)\n\nwith [ , ] denoting the commutator of the enclosed operators. Hence, the\nsymmetric set {K\u0302, K\u0302 \u2020 , K\u03020 } forms a closed algebra under commutation. Further, when k = 0 the algebra is the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra generated by\n\u02c6 Another interesting limit corresponds to k = 1. In this case, the\n{\u00e2, \u00e2\u2020 , I}.\nalgebra defined in Eq. (5) is SU(1,1) algebra. Thus, two important algebras,\nnamely, the Heisenberg-Weyl and the SU(1,1), are the special cases of the\ngeneralized algebra defined in Eq. (5). Mathematically, choosing nonzero k\nvalues amounts to deforming the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. Thus, the Hamiltonian \u0124S can be viewed as a deformed JC Hamiltonian. Though there is\na formal resemblance between \u0124JC and \u0124S , the deformation (k 6= 0) allows\nto include nonlinearity and intensity-dependent coupling. Under suitable\nlimits, the Hamiltonian \u0124S approximates many well-studied Hamiltonians.\nFor instance, when k = 0, \u0124S becomes the usual JC model;\n\u221a when the\u221amean\nphoton number of the field satisfies kh\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2i >> 1, then 1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u223c k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2\nand \u0124S approximates the Buck-Sukumar Hamiltonian [6].\nIn the single-mode field-atom bipartite system, the field is a continuous variable (infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) system while the atom is\ndescribed in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Recently, much work has\nbeen done on systems with two continuous variable subsystems; the entangled coherent states [14, 15] being the most widely studied. Such entangled\ncontinuous systems have desirable features which can be exploited in teleportation, quantum communication, etc [16, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 15, 21, 22].\nTwo-mode electromagnetic fields can be entangled by allowing them to interact with a two-level atom in a cavity. A basic scheme to perform this was\n3\n\n\fexplored in [23] by employing a two-mode JC model. Various versions of\nthe two-mode JC model [24] have been used in important contexts like the\nphase damping [25], entanglement distribution [26], entangling field modes\nwith a moving atom [27], entropy squeezing [28] etc. In this work, a natural\nextension of \u0124S is studied. One possibility is to consider\n1\n\u0124T = \u03c91 K\u03021\u2020 K\u03021 + \u03c92 K\u03022\u2020 K\u03022 + \u03c3\u0302z + \u03bb(K\u03021\u2020 K\u03022\u2020 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 + K\u03021 K\u03022 \u03c3\u0302+ ),\n2\np\n\n\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u00e2\n\n(6)\n\nq\n\nand K\u03022 = 1 + k2 b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 b\u0302. The creation operators\nwhere K\u03021 = 1 + k1\nof the two modes are \u00e2 and b\u0302 respectively; the corresponding annihilation\noperators are \u00e2\u2020 and \u00e2\u2020 . The suffix \"T\" indicates that the composite system\ninvolves a two-mode field. The operators K\u03021 and K\u03022 correspond to the two\nfield modes of the cavity. The deformation parameters k1 and k2 satisfy\n0 \u2264 k1 , k2 \u2264 1. The operators in each of the sets {K\u03021 , K\u03021\u2020 , K\u030210 = k1 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + 12 }\nand {K\u03022 , K\u03022\u2020 , K\u030220 = k2 b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302+ 12 }, satisfy the closed algebra; defined in Eq. (5).\nThe dynamics dictated by the two-mode Hamiltonian \u0124T is exactly solvable. This Hamiltonian, like its one-mode counterpart \u0124S , approximates,\nmany of the known two-mode JC models. For instance, if k1 = k2 = 0\nthen \u0124T corresponds to the Hamiltonian studied in the context of phase\ndamping [25]. When the mean photon number is large enough so that\n1 + kh\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2i \u2248 kh\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2ipand 1 + khb\u0302\u2020 b\u0302i \u2248 khb\u0302\u2020 b\u0302i, then the interaction term\n\u221a\nis approximated by b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u00e2b\u0302\u03c3\u0302+ + adjoint and the resulting Hamiltonian is the two-mode Buck-Sukumar Hamiltonian.\nIn the present work, dynamics dictated by the Hamiltonian \u0124S and \u0124T\nare studied; in particular, the dynamics of population inversion and of entanglement are analyzed. This paper is organized in the following way. Results\non the single-mode system are presented first and those on the two-mode system are presented subsequently. In section II, dynamics of entanglement in\nthe single mode case is discussed. The effects of nonlinearity and intensitydependent coupling on the dynamics are studied. In section III, analyses on\ntwo-mode case are presented. Dynamics of various tangles in the system are\nstudied, and wherever possible, the results are compared with those of the\nsingle mode case.\n\nII. Single-mode NJC model\nIn the single-mode NJC model, there are two degrees of freedom in the\nsystem, corresponding to the field and the two-level atom respectively. The\nHamiltonian of the system is taken to be \u0124S . The initial state of the atomfield system is taken to be a product state. Entanglement between the atom\nand the field is generated by the interaction.

The initial state of the system is ( n fn |e, ni),\nwhere the coefficients fn of the field state are chosen to be those of |\u03b1i or\n|zi. Thus, the initial conditions, Ce,n (0) and Cg,n (0), are\nCe,n (0) = fn ; Cg,n (0) = 0.\n\n(12)\n\nThese are the initial conditions when the atom evolves from its excited state.\nThe density operator for the system is the projection operator |\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)|,\nexpressed in the {|e, ni, |g, ni} basis as\n\u03c1\u0302 = |\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)| =\n\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na,b=e,g n,m=0\n\n5\n\n\u2217\nCa,n (t)Cb,m\n(t)|a, nihb, m|.\n\n(13)\n\n\fPopulation inversion WS (t) is defined as the difference in the probabilities of the atom to be in the states |ei and |gi. Hence,\nWS (t) = T r[\u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302z ] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n[|Ce,n (t)|2 \u2212 |Cg,n (t)|2 ],\n\n(14)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere Tr stands for tracing over both the atomic and field states. Evolution\nof WS (t) is shown in Fig. 1, when the field is initially the coherent state |\u03b1i.\nThe figures stacked in the first column correspond to k = 0; the second and\nthird columns correspond to k = 10\u22124 and k = 10\u22123 respectively. Different\nrows of figures give information on the effect of detuning. The figures in the\nfirst row correspond to \u2206 = 0. A special feature of the Hamiltonian \u0124S is\nthe existence of a minimum for the Rabi frequency \u03a9n , for some n = n\u0304. The\nnumerical value of n\u0304 is related to the other parameters through [13]\nn\u0304 =\n\nk\u2206 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03c9 2 (1 + k)\n.\n2k\u03c9(k + \u03bb2 )\n\n(15)\n\nIf the mean value of h\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2i is chosen to be n\u0304, the corresponding \u2206 satisfying the Eq. (15) is the critical detuning \u2206c . In the resonant JC model\n(k = 0, \u2206 = 0), the perfect collapses of the population inversion are Gaussian modulated cosines [29, 30]. The dynamics of WS (t) is known to have\ndistinct features, such as 'super structures' in the \"collapse - revival\" pattern, when \u2206 \u2248 \u2206c , i.e., the envelope of collapse or revival is not a Gaussian\nmodulated cosine [9]. This is shown in the figure located at the third row of\nthe second column in Fig. 1. It is to be noted that a minimum in the Rabi\nfrequency is possible only when k 6= 0.\nThe first column of figures in Fig. 1 shows the effect of higher detuning\non the dynamics of WS (t). Larger detuning inhibits the interaction between\nthe atom and the field. This is expected based on the Fermi's Golden rule\nwhich states that interaction probability becomes smaller as the field frequency deviates from the resonant condition. Hence, with large detuning\nthe atom evolves such that it has substantial overlap with its initial state.\nThe last figure corresponds to \u2206 = 0.016 and the WS (t) profile indicates\nthat the atom practically remains in the excited state.\nDynamics dictated by \u0124S differs from that of \u0124JC due to the Kerr\nterm and the intensity-dependent interaction in \u0124\n\u221aS . The strength of the\nnonlinearity(\u221d k\u00e2\u2020 2 \u00e22 ) and that of the coupling(\u221d 1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2) increase with\nk. It is found that if k = 0.01, even under resonant condition, the state of\nthe atom has substantial overlap with the excited state |ei. This implies\nthat the presence of cavity field has not resulted in any significant change of\natomic state. As noted earlier, the atom-field interaction becomes insignificant if the interaction is non-resonant due to large detuning in the usual JC\n6\n\n\fmodel, which is the undeformed \u0124S . Thus, the effect of large \"k\" mimics the\neffect of large detuning. The origin of this \"inhibition of emission\" from the\nexcited state is mostly due to the the nonlinear term k\u00e2\u2020 2 \u00e22 . In the case of\ncoherent states, k\u00e2\u2020 2 \u00e22 term contributes |\u03b1|4\u221a\n+ |\u03b1|2 to the totalpenergy while\nthe contribution from the interaction term 1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2\u00e2 is \u223c 1 + k|\u03b1|2 \u03b1.\nFor small value of mean photon number(h\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2i \u223c 1), the contributions of\nthe nonlinear term and the interaction term to the energy are nearly equal.\nHowever, for large amplitude coherent state, the nonlinear term dominates\nover the interaction. To bring out these features the variation of WS (t) is\nplotted in Fig. 3 for |\u03b1|2 = 1 and |\u03b1|2 = 30. The interaction is assumed\nto be resonant. From the figures it is seen that as k increases, the quantity\nWS (t) stays close to unity if |\u03b1|2 = 30 and oscillates if |\u03b1|2 = 1. In the\nlarge amplitude case, the population inversion remains close to unity while\nit swings between 1 and 0.2 when |\u03b1|2 \u223c 1. The former corresponds to dominant nonlinearity while the later corresponds to nearly equal magnitudes\nof the nonlinearity and the interaction. Thus, the \"inhibition of emission\",\ndespite the presence of a resonant field, is due to the nonlinear term.\nEven at smaller values of k the effect of nonlinearity can be dominant.\nThe last column of Fig. 1 corresponds to k = 10\u22123 , an order of magnitude\nsmaller than 10\u22122 . The initially excited atom is left almost undisturbed in\nthe resonant case as evident from the nearly time-independent WS (t). As\nthe detuning increases, the atom begins to interact with the field, and, consequently, the oscillations in WS (t) are larger. This is inferred by comparing\nthe figures in the first row (zero detuning) of Fig. 1 with those in the successive rows (higher detunings). These counter-intuitive features, that is,\nnoninteracting, resonant field and interacting, non-resonant field, are due to\nthe presence of nonlinearity.\nIn Fig. 2, the dynamics of WS (t) is shown when the field is initially\na squeezed vacuum. Some of the features present in the interaction of the\natom with coherent state are absent. Even though, the mean number of\nphotons in the squeezed vacuum is chosen to satisfy Eq. (15), there are no\n\"super\" structures in the population inversion. However, as in the coherent\nstate case, the field-atom interaction is strengthened at nonzero detuning\nwhen the value of the deforming parameter k is nonzero but small ( 10\u22123 ).\nThe mean number of photons in the CS and the SV are the same. Hence,\nthe differences in the dynamics are due to the different photon statistics of\nthe two states.\nInteraction\nbetween the atom and the field entangles them. The initial\nP\nstate\nfn |e, ni is a product state and hence the entanglement is zero. To\nstudy the effectiveness of the interaction in entangling the atom and field\nsystem, linear entropy is used as the measure of entanglement. If \u03c1\u0302 is the\ndensity operator of the composite system, its linear entropy (L) is defined\nas\nL = 2(1 \u2212 T r[\u03c1\u03022f ]) = 2(1 \u2212 T r[\u03c1\u03022a ]).\n(16)\n7\n\n\fHere \u03c1\u0302f [respectively, \u03c1\u0302a ] is the reduced density operator of the field [respectively, atom] obtained by partially tracing over the atomic [respectively,\nfield] states. For instance, the reduced density operator \u03c1\u0302a for the atom is\n\u03c1\u0302a =\n\n|Ce,n (t)|2\nP\n\u2217\nn Ce,n (t)Cg,n (t)\nP\n\nn\n\nP\n\nC \u2217 (t)Cg,n (t)\nn\nP e,n\n2\nn |Cg,n (t)|\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nEven though other measures such as von Neumann entropy exist, in the case\nof pure states all entanglement measures are equivalent. In this work, linear\nentropy is used as the entanglement measure as it is easier to compute. The\ntwo quantities, namely, WS and L, are related by\nL = 1 \u2212 WS2 \u2212 4|\n\nX\n\n\u2217\nCe,n\nCg,n |2 .\n\n(18)\n\n\u2217 C\nThe quantity | Ce,n\ng,n | is the atomic coherence since this particular term\nappears as off-diagonal element in the reduced density matrix of the atom.\nThe time-evolution of population inversion shows a striking resemblance to\nthe entanglement if the initial field state is a squeezed vacuum, see Figs. 2\nand 5. This feature is not to be seen in the case of coherent states, see Figs. 1\nand 4. This observation is explained by the relationship, Eqn. (18), between\nthe linear entropy and the population inversion. It turns out, as indicated\nby numerical calculations, that the atomic coherence vanishes during evolution if the initial state is a squeezed vacuum. Consequently, L = 1 \u2212 WS2\nand there is a good resemblance of the L(t) and WS (t) profiles. In the case\nof CS, the atomic coherence is not small. As a result, the L(t) and WS (t)\nprofiles do not match. Interestingly, in this case the atomic coherence spikes\nto larger values during the course of evolution. Whenever, the coherence is\nlarge, the reduced density matrix is less mixed. This, in turn, means that the\nentanglement of the composite system is less. This is the origin of low entanglement spikes in the case of atom-coherent state interaction, refer Fig. 4.\n\nP\n\nThe time-evolution of linear entropy (L) is shown in Fig. 4, when the\ncavity field is initially a coherent state. In Fig. 5, results on the dynamics\nof L are given for the squeezed vacuum case. The first row of the figures\ncorrespond to \u2206 = 0 (resonant case). The figures in the first column correspond to k = 0 while those in the second column correspond to k = 10\u22123 .\nIn the resonant case, the amplitude of variation of L smaller if the value of\nk is nonzero. The effect of deformation is to minimize the effectiveness of\nthe interaction in entangling the atom and the resonant field. This readily\ncorroborates with the fact that the population inversion is nearly unity for\nthis case, refer Fig. 1 and 2. Higher values of population inversion (\u2248 1)\nimply that the atomic state is \u2248 |ei; consequently, the composite system is\na product state and the linear entropy (equivalently, the entanglement) is\nnearly zero. Hence, with the increase of k, the entanglement in the atomfield system becomes zero, even in the resonant case. In the non-resonant\nNJC model, higher values of k make the time-evolved atomic state to have\nsubstantial overlap with the ground state. This is in contrast with the nonresonant JC model in which the interaction becomes less effective in causing\n8\n\n\fTable 1: Mean entanglement in single-mode NJC model\nMean entanglement\n\u2206\nk\nCoherent state Squeezed vacuum\n0\n0\n0.84\n0.97\n0\n1 \u00d7 10\u22124\n0.89\n0.94\n0\n1 \u00d7 10\u22123\n0.04\n0.34\n0.01\n0\n0.56\n0.64\n0.01\n1 \u00d7 10\u22124\n0.91\n0.77\n0.01\n1 \u00d7 10\u22123\n0.75\n0.26\n0.0161\n0\n0.3\n0.44\n0.0161 1 \u00d7 10\u22124\n0.74\n0.62\n\u22123\n0.0161 1 \u00d7 10\n0.81\n0.24\ntransitions as detuning increases. Thus, in the non-resonant case, the NJC\ninteraction is more effective in entangling the atom and the field than the\nJC interaction.\nA simpler way of assessing the effectiveness of the interaction in entangling the field and the atom is to study the mean entanglement L\u0304, defined\nas [31]\nZ\n1 T\nL(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 ,\n(19)\nL\u0304 =\nT 0\nis used. The value of T is chosen so that gT is 100. The values of the mean\nentanglement is shown in Table 1 for the single mode case. Small nonzero\nvalues of k, of the order of 10\u22124 leads to better entanglement than zero or\nlarge values for k. In the resonant case L\u0304 approaches zero as k increases\nfrom 10\u22124 to 10\u22123 . In the non-resonant case the entanglement does not\nbecome small even if k increases to 10\u22123 . It is interesting to note that in the\nsingle-mode case, entanglement is more effective in the non-resonant case if\nthe initial field is a CS in comparison to the case of initial field being in the\nSV.\n\nIII. Two mode NJC model\nIn this section, the interaction between a two-level atom and a two-mode\ncavity field is studied. Two types of fields are considered: pair coherent (PC)\nstate |\u03b6i [32] and two-mode squeezed vacuum |\u03bci (TSV) [33]. The respective\nFock state representations are:\n|\u03b6i = N0\n\nX \u03b6n\nn\n\np\n\nn!\n\n|n, ni,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere N0 = 1/ I0 (2|\u03b6|), I0 (2|\u03b6|) is the modified Bessel function of order\n\n9\n\n\fzero and \u03b6 \u2208 C is the amplitude of the state;\n|\u03bci =\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03bc|2\n\nX\nn\n\n\u03bcn |n, ni,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03bc \u2208 C is the amplitude of state and 0 \u2264 |\u03bc| < 1. Both these states\ninvolve superposition of paired states |n, ni, which have equal number of\nquanta in both modes. The unpaired states |n, mi(n 6= m) are not present.\nIn the quantum entanglement context, the TSV is an important example of\nentangled Gaussian state and the PC state is entangled but non-Gaussian.\nInterestingly, TSV arises also in the context of teleportation of uniformly\naccelerated objects[34].\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is taken to be \u0124T , the two-mode extenP\nsion of \u0124S . The state of the system at time \"t\" is |\u03a8(t)i = \u221e\nn=0 (Ce,n,n (t)|e, n, ni+\nCg,n,n (t)|g, n, ni). Unpaired states are absent in the evolved state |\u03a8(t)i as\nwell. This feature is due to the type of interaction being considered and\nthe absence of unpaired states in the initial state. In what follows, we set\nk1 = k2 = k. With this\nq choice for the two deformation parameters, the\n\ninteraction term \u0124I = \u03bb (1 + k\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2)(1 + kb\u0302\u2020 b\u0302)\u00e2b\u0302\u03c3\u0302+ + adjoint gives,\n\u0124I |e, n, ni = \u03bb(1 + kn + k)|g, n + 1, n + 1i,\n\n(22)\n\n\u0124I |g, n, ni = \u03bb(1 + kn \u2212 k)|e, n \u2212 1, n \u2212 1i.\n\n(23)\n\nThat is, a paired state is transformed to another paired state. More precisely,\nunder the action of \u0124T , the paired state |e, n, ni becomes the paired state\n|g, n + 1, n + 1i and vice-versa. Hence, the evolved state is a superposition of\npaired states if the initial state is a superposition of paired states. Another\nconsequence is that there are invariant subspaces in the Hilbert space of the\ntripartite system. It is easily recognized from the transformations indicated\nin Eqs. (21) and (22), that the span of {|e, n, ni, |g, n + 1, n + 1i}, for a fixed\nn, is invariant under the action of \u0124I . Moreover, the invariant subspaces are\ndisjoint. These features imply that the dynamics of the coefficients Ce,n,n (t)\nand Cg,n+1,n+1 (t) are coupled to each other and do not depend on the dynamics of other coefficients. The Schrodinger equation for the dynamics of\nthe coefficients Ce,n,n (t) and Cg,n+1,n+1 (t) is the matrix equation,\nd\ni\ndt\n\n\u0012\n\nCe,n,n (t)\nCg,n+1,n+1 (t)\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\nh11 h12\nh21 h22\n\n\u0015\u0012\n\nCe,n,n (t)\nCg,n+1,n+1 (t)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nHere h11 = \u03c91 (n + 12 + kn2 \u2212 kn) + \u03c92 (n + 12 + kn2 \u2212 kn) + \u2206\n2,\n1\n1\n\u2206\n2\n2\nh22 = \u03c91 (n + 2 + kn + kn) + \u03c92 (n + 2 + kn + kn) \u2212 2 ,\nand h12 = h21 = \u03bb(1 + n)(1 + kn) . Here, \u2206 = \u03bd \u2212 (\u03c91 + \u03c92 ) is the detuning.\nThis matrix equation is solved to give\ne\u2212i\u2206n,n t/2 Ce,n,n (t) = [cos(\n\ni\u2206n,n\n\u03a9n,n t\n\u03a9n,n t\n)\u2212\n)]Ce,n,n (0)\nsin(\n2\n\u03a9n,n\n2\n10\n\n\f\u2212\n\n\u03a9n,n t\n2i\u03bb\u03b7n,n\n) Cg,n+1,n+1 (0),\nsin(\n\u03a9n,n\n2\n\n(25)\n\n\u03a9n,n t\ni\u2206n,n\n\u03a9n,n t\n)+\nsin(\n)]Cg,n+1,n+1 (0)\n2\n\u03a9n,n\n2\n2i\u03bb\u03b7n,n\n\u03a9n,n t\n\u2212\nsin(\n) Ce,n,n (0),\n(26)\n\u03a9n,n\n2\n\nei\u2206n,n t/2 Cg,n+1,n+1 (t) = [cos(\n\nq\n\n2\nwhere \u2206n,n = \u2206 \u2212 2k\u03c91 n \u2212 2k\u03c92 n, \u03a9n,n = \u22062n,n + 4\u03bb2 \u03b7n,n\nand \u03b7n,n =\n(1 + n)(1 + kn). These analytical solutions are used in calculating population inversion and entanglement measures in the tripartite system.\n\nThe reduced density operator \u03c1\u0302A for the atomic system is\n\u03c1\u0302A =\n\n|C\n(t)|2\nP n e,n,n \u2217\nn Ce,n,n (t)Cg,n,n (t)\nP\n\n\u2217\nCe,n,n\n(t)Cg,n,n (t)\nnP\n2\n|C\ng,n,n (t)|\nn\n\nP\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\nFor the two-mode case, the population inversion, denoted by WT (t), is given\nby\nX\nWT (t) =\n[|Ce,n,n (t)|2 \u2212 |Cg,n,n (t)|2 ].\n(28)\nn\n\nThe evolution of population inversion is given in Fig. 6 for the PC state\nand in Fig. 7 for the TSV. In both the figures, the successive columns\ncorrespond to k = 0 and k = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 respectively. And the successive\nrows correspond to different detuning parameter values (\u2206) starting from\nzero detuning. In the resonant two-mode JC model, i.e., \u2206 = 0 and k =\n0, the Rabi frequencies satisfy \u03a9n,n t = gt(1 + n); these frequencies are\ncommensurate and so the dynamics is periodic. As a consequence, WT (t)\nshows periodic features in the resonant two-photon JC model. At the time\ninstances when gt = l\u03c0 (l, a positive integer) the atom returns to the initial\nstate, unlike in the single mode case. This periodicity is destroyed in the\nnon-resonant interaction as the Rabi frequencies are incommensurate. The\natomic evolution from the excited state is increasingly inhibited with larger\ndetuning which is evident from the column 1 of Figs. 6 and 7. It is to\nbe noted that the Rabi frequency \u03a9n,n depends only on a single quantum\nnumber \"n\", a consequence of the initial field being a superposition of paired\nstate. As a function of n, the two-mode Rabi frequency exhibits a minimum\n\u2202\u03a9\nat n = n\u0304, obtained by solving \u2202tn,n |n=n\u0304 = 0, provided k 6= 0. The detuning\ncorresponding to n = n\u0304 is called critical detuning, which is given as\n\u2206n\u0304,n\u0304 = \u2206\u2032c = k\u03c9 N\u0304 +\n\ng2\n3\n1\n[(1 + k)(2 + N\u0304 + kN\u0304 + N\u0304 2 k) + N\u0304 3 k2 ],\nk\u03c9\n2\n2\n\n(29)\n\nwhere N\u0304 = 2n\u0304 is the total mean photon number of the two-mode radiation\nfield. At critical detuning, the evolution of WT (t) has noticeable features.\n11\n\n\fThe envelope of WT (t) appears periodic and this is lost when detuning\nshifts away from \u2206\u2032c . This is seen by comparing the figures in the third\nrow(\u2206 = \u2206\u2032c ) with the those in the second row(\u2206 < \u2206\u2032c ) of Fig. 6. Further,\nnonzero k value (refer the second column of Fig. 6) significantly influences\nthe envelope pattern in the population inversion. As in the case of single\nmode NJC, the critical detuning alters the population inversion dynamics qualitatively. A difference in the evolution at critical detuning, in the\nsingle-mode and two-mode cases is to be pointed out. In the single-mode\ncase, super structures are seen if the initial field state is a CS while such\nstructures are not prominent if the initial state is a SV. But in the two-mode\ncase, similar structures in the envelope of WT (t) are observed whether the\ninitial field state is a PC state or a TSV.\nThe system described by \u0124T is a tripartite system: a two-level atom\nand two field modes. The Hilbert spaces associated with the field modes\nare of infinite dimension. There is no known measure of entanglement if\nany subsystem of a tripartite system is of infinite dimension. An assessment\nof entanglement in the system is obtained by studying bipartite entanglement in different partitions of the system. In the present case, the relevant\npartitions are: (i) two-level atom as a subsystem and the two field modes\ntogether form the other subsystem; (ii) two-level atom along with one of the\nfield modes as one subsystem and the other field mode as the other subsystem; and (iii) the third possibility is to exchange the roles of the fields\nin the previous case. The entanglement measures of the different bipartite\npartitions are called tangles (T ). The states considered in this work are\npure states and hence the various tangles are chosen to be the respective\nvon Neumann or linear entropies. Thus,\nTA,F1 \u2297F2 = 2[1 \u2212 T r(\u03c1\u03022A )] = 2[1 \u2212 T r(\u03c1\u03022F1 \u2297F2 )],\nTA\u2297F1 ,F2 = \u2212T r[\u03c1\u0302A\u2297F1 log2 (\u03c1\u0302A\u2297F1 )] = \u2212T r[\u03c1\u0302F2 log2 (\u03c1\u0302F2 )],\n\nTA\u2297F2 ,F1 = \u2212T r[\u03c1\u0302A\u2297F2 log2 (\u03c1\u0302A\u2297F2 )] = \u2212T r[\u03c1\u0302F1 log2 (\u03c1\u0302F1 )].\n\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\n\nThe suffix (A, F1 \u2297 F2 ) indicates that the atom is treated as a subsystem\nand the two field modes (F1 and F2 ) are treated as a single entity is another\nsubsystem of the relevant partition. Similar convention is adapted for the\nother suffixes. The initial field state, a superposition of paired states is\nsymmetric under the exchange of photon numbers of the two modes and\nthis symmetry is preserved during evolution. Consequently, TA\u2297F1 ,F2 and\nTA\u2297F2 ,F1 are identical. In Figs. 8 and 9, only TA\u2297F1 ,F2 is shown. The\ncalculation of TA\u2297F1 ,F2 requires the reduced density matrix of the atom and\nthe first mode, which is\n\u03c1\u0302A\u2297F1\n\n=\n\nX\nn\n\n\u2217\n|Ce,n,n |2 |enihen| + Ce,n,n Cg,n,n\n|enihgn|\n\n\u2217\n+Cg,n,n Ce,n,n\n|gnihen| + |Cg,n,n |2 |gnihgn|.\n\n(33)\n\nAnother quantity that is of interest is the entanglement between the two\nfield modes. Quantum relative entropy EF1 ,F2 is a measure of entanglement\n12\n\n\fin a bipartite field state involving only the paired states [35]. The field\ndensity matrix is\n\u03c1\u0302F1 ,F2 =\n\nX\n\nhr|\u03a8(t)ih\u03a8(t)|ri\n\n(34)\n\nan,m |n, nihm, m| ,\n\n(35)\n\nr=e,g\n\n=\n\nX\n\nn,m\n\nobtained by tracing over the atomic states in the complete density matrix\nof the tripartite system.

The von\n+ Cg,n,n Cg,m,m\nthe coefficients Ce,n,n and Cg,n,n , is Ce,n,nCe,m,m\nNeumann entropy is\nS(\u03c1\u0302F1 ,F2 ) = \u2212T r[\u03c1\u0302F1,F2 log2 (\u03c1\u0302F1 ,F2 )],\n\n(36)\n\nand the quantum relative entropy is\nEF1 ,F2 = \u2212\n\nX\nn\n\nan,n log2 (an,n ) \u2212 S(\u03c1\u0302F1 ,F2 ).\n\n(37)\n\nThe tangles TA,F1\u2297F2 , TA\u2297F1 ,F2 and the relative entropy E(\u03c1\u0302F1 ,F2 ) are\nshown in Figs. 8 and 9 for the system when the initial states are PC and TSV\nrespectively. As in the case of Figs. 6 and 7, the two columns correspond\nto k = 0 and 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 respectively. The three rows of figures correspond\nto \u2206 = 0, \u2206 = 0.01(< \u2206\u2032c ), and \u2206 = 0.0161(= \u2206\u2032c ) respectively. The\nmean photon number of the two modes is taken to be 3. This ensures\nthat the contribution from higher photon number states are negligible and\nnumerical computations are reliable. Firstly, the time evolution profile of\nthe tangle TA\u2297F1 ,F2 and the relative entropy EF1 ,F2 do not resemble that of\nthe population inversion WT (t). However, TA,F1 \u2297F2 which is linear entropy,\nis related to WT (t) through\nWT2 = 1 \u2212 TA,F1 \u2297F2 \u2212 4|\n\nX\n\n\u2217\nCe,n,n\nCg,n,n |2 .\n\n(38)\n\nIn spite of this relation, the profiles of WT and TA,F1 \u2297F2 are not similar. This\nis in contrast with the single-mode case wherein the profiles of the entanglement resemble with WS (t), at least for the smaller values of the parameter\nk. The reason\nthis dissimilarity is that in the two-mode case, the atomic\nP for\n\u2217\ncoherence | Ce,n,n\nCg,n,n |2 is comparable to TA,F1 \u2297F2 and does not become\nsmall either for the pair coherent state or the two-mode squeezed vacuum.\nThe profiles of the tangles and the relative entropy are periodic, when\nk = 0 and \u2206 = 0, corresponding to the resonant two-mode JC model. When\nthe deformation parameter k is nonzero but small (= 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 ), the periodicity in the evolution is destroyed. As noted earlier, this feature is present\n13\n\n\fin the evolution of WT too. Another interesting aspect is the negative correlation between the time-evolutions of the tangle TA,F1 \u2297F2 and the relative\nentropy E, i.e., increase (decrease) of TA,F1 \u2297F2 is associated with decrease\n(increase) of E. The negative correlation may be interpreted as redistribution of entanglement, from the field-field entanglement to that between\nthe atom and the two modes. This feature is retained even if k is nonzero\nimplying that the nonlinearity and the intensity-dependent interaction do\nnot hinder the redistribution of entanglement.\nIn the non-resonant case, the atom does not interact with the field effectively and hence the initial entanglement is not expected to vary much.\nIt is essential to study the cases corresponding to \u2206 = \u2206\u2032c and \u2206 6= \u2206\u2032c .\nThere is an increase of amplitude in the tangle oscillation as k increases\nto 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 from zero as if the atom-field interaction is effective as in the\nresonant case. Thus, small non-zero k leads to a \"resonance\" effect in the\nnon-resonant situation. At slightly larger values of k \u2248 10\u22122 , the quantity\nTA,F1 \u2297F2 becomes insignificant indicating very less entanglement between\nthe atom and the two modes. However, this fact is to be expected; for such\nvalues of k the population inversion WT (t) is nearly unity implying that the\natomic state is \u223c |ei and hence the atom is not entangled with the fields.\nThe need for larger k, in comparison to k = 10\u22123 in the single-mode case,\nto disentangle the atom and the two fields is because of the smaller photon\nnumber (\u2248 3) in the two-mode case.\nAs in the single mode case, it is useful to define the mean of the tangles\nand the relative entropy to characterize the effectiveness of the interaction\nin entangling the systems. Definitions similar to L\u0304 are adopted for the entanglement measures TA,F1 \u2297F2 and TA\u2297F1 ,F2 and the relative entropy EF1 ,F2 .\nThe mean is computed over a period T such that gT = 20. From the table\nit seen that there is not as much effect on the mean values with increase of\nk when compared with the single mode case.\n\nTable 2: Mean tangles and Mean relative entropy in two-mode NJC model\nMean TA,F1 \u2297F2 Mean TA\u2297F1 ,F2 Mean EF1 ,F2\n\u2206\nk\nPC\nTSV\nPC\nTSV\nPC\nTSV\n0\n0\n0.39\n0.50\n1.89\n2.41\n1.42\n1.86\n0\n2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n0.41\n0.7\n1.88\n2.4\n1.38\n1.65\n0.01\n0\n0.58\n0.58\n2.1\n2.52\n1.45\n1.86\n0.01\n2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n0.61\n0.7\n1.97\n2.51\n1.27\n1.74\n0.0161\n0\n0.40\n0.40\n2.08\n2.49\n1.60\n1.98\n0.0161 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n0.66\n0.59\n2.09\n2.51\n1.33\n1.84\n\nIV. Summary\nNonlinearity and intensity-dependent interactions affect entanglement between an atom and a cavity field. The time-evolution due to \u0124S , wherein\n14\n\n\f\u221a\nboth nonlinearity (Kerr type) and intensity-dependent interaction (\u221d 1 + intensity)\nare included, is exactly solvable. The dynamical symmetry of the Hamiltonian is a deformed Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. When the deformation vanishes, the algebra is the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. The deformation can be\ncontinuously varied so that the algebra is SU(1,1) when the deforming parameter is unity. The deforming parameter has the physical significance that\nthe nonlinearity and the interaction are proportional to it. The Hamiltonians considered in this work approximate many other Hamiltonians that are\nuseful in modeling various quantum optical systems.\nThe deformed Hamiltonian \u0124S makes the Rabi frequency to attain a\nminimum value which allows for critical detuning. When the cavity field is\nchosen so that the mean photon number is n\u0304 and there is critical detuning\nbetween the field and the atom, the dynamics exhibits \"super structures\"\nin the evolution of population inversion. In the case of single-mode interaction, with a small deformation (k \u2248 10\u22124 ) the evolution of population\ninversion and entanglement are very different from those in the usual JC\ninteraction(k = 0). One of the effects of nonzero k is that the collapses\nand revivals in the population inversion are less pronounced due to the Kerr\nnonlinearity. In reality, weak nonlinearities and intensity-dependent interactions are often unavoidable. This implies that in experiments it is really\nhard to see as many distinct \"revivals and collapses\" as indicated by the\nusual single-mode JC model. At resonance, the effect of higher k is to inhibit the evolution of the atom from its excited state. These features are\ncommon to both the single-mode and the two-mode NJC models. Some\naspects of population inversion dynamics are different for the single-mode\nand two-mode models. In the undeformed, resonant case the population\ninversion WS (t) exhibits 'collapse-revival' structure when the initial state is\na coherent state and these features are absent if the initial field is a squeezed\nvacuum. In the two-mode case, such structures are seen when the cavity is\neither a pair coherent state or a two-mode squeezed vacuum. In the nonresonant case, the deformed Hamiltonian generates more entanglement than the\nundeformed case. In the resonant case, small deformations tend to reduce\nthe effectiveness of the interaction and hence the entanglement is reduced.\nIn the two-mode case, the tangle TA,F1 \u2297F2 and the relative entropy EF1 ,F2\nof the two fields exhibit negative correlation in their dynamics. This is interpreted as the redistribution of entanglement from that between the fields\nto that between the atom and the fields and vice versa.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors acknowledge Dr. M. V.
