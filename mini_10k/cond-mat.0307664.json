Introduction\nEfforts to integrate sub-10 nm-scaled CMOS devices will face physical limitations in\nthe near future. To continue further increases in density with low power consumption, the\ntrend is now to develop new device concepts turning the size reduction and quantum effects to\nadvantage. In this field, one of the most promising idea is to use the Coulomb blockade\nmechanism in conducting island / tunnel junction systems to accurately control the current in\nsingle electron devices (SEDs). Self-assembled silicon nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in SiO2\nappear as a good basic structure for the realization of SEDs likely to operate at room\ntemperature [1]. The compatibility of such NCs with Si technology makes them good\ncandidates for actual applications in combination with conventional CMOS circuits. The\nconcept of multi-dot memory using Si NCs as a floating gate has been demonstrated [2-4]. It\ncould be developed to design nonvolatile multibit memory cells of very high scalability and\nreliability with low power consumption. The Coulomb blockade and quantization effects have\nbeen used in memory device with self-aligned doubly-stacked dots to improve the retention\ntime [5] and demonstrated in single electron transistors (SETs) at room temperature [6].\nThe realisation and optimisation of SEDs requires accurate computational simulation of\nsingle electron charging effects to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. One\nimportant preliminary task is to calculate exactly the energy band structure inside the\nsemiconductor NC where quantum effects become important. Several numerical techniques\nhave been developed using either a tight-binding description [7] or an effective mass\napproximation [8-10]. The self-consistent Poisson-Schr\u00f6dinger calculation based on the\nHartree approximation or the density functional theory is convenient to determine the ground\nstate of a many-electron system in the dot as in Ref. 10. Simple analytical models have been\nreported in the case of a single electron in a spherical quantum dot [11,12]. However, in these\nworks the authors assumed the electron effective mass to be the same in the dot as in the\nsurrounding barrier, which can make the results inappropriate to realistic applications. The\npresent work deals with the exact calculation of single-electron energy and wave-function for\nall bound states in a realistic Si NC embedded in SiO2 by including the change in effective\nmass from one material to the other. We give a detailed investigation of the energy structure\nfor a wide range of dot radius, barrier height, and barrier-to-dot electron mass ratio. Our\nresults are finally used to verify the accuracy of the results obtained using the numerical\nmethod developed in Ref. 10. It should be noted that the calculation is exact, fast and\napplicable for a spherical square-well quantum dot system of any size and potential barrier in\nany material system.\n2\n\n\f2. Model for exact calculation\nWe study the conduction band structure for a single-electron in a spherical QD within\nthe model of finite square-well potential of radius R and energy barrier V0 . Unless otherwise\nindicated, the effective atomic units are used in the whole article, i.e. the unit of mass is the\nfree electron mass m0 , the unit of length is the effective Bohr radius, a B * = a B mSi (with\na B = 0.529 \u00c5) and the unit of energy is the effective Hartree E Hart * = m Si E Hart (with\nE Hart = 27.212 eV). The electron effective mass in silicon m Si is approximated as the\nharmonic mean of the longitudinal and\n\ntransverse masses\n\nin \u2206 valleys,\n\ni.e.\n\nm Si = 3 (1 ml + 2 mt )\u22121 \u2248 0.27 . On the basis of Weinberg experimental work [13] the barrier\nheight V0 and the electron effective mass in SiO2 m SiO2 are chosen equal to 3.1 eV and 0.5,\nrespectively. These values are frequently used in tunnelling calculations in the Si/SiO2\nsystem (see [14] and references therein).\nIn the effective mass approximation, which proves to be justified for the determination\nof the first levels even for dot radius as small as 15 \u00c5 [15], the single electron Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation is given by\n\uf8ee 1 r\uf8eb 1 r \uf8f6\nr\uf8f9 r\nr\n\uf8ef\u2212 2 \u2207 r \uf8ec m* \u2207 r \uf8f7 + V (r )\uf8fa \u03a8 (r ) = E \u03a8 (r )\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nr \uf8f10\nV (r ) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3V0\n\n,r<R\n,r\u2265R\n\nand\n\n\uf8f1 m Si\nm* = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3mSiO2\n\n,r<R\n,r\u2265R\n\n(2)\n\nDue to spherical symmetry of the system, the wavefunction may be written in the form\nr\n\u03a8 (r ) = Yl ,m (\u03c6 ,\u03b8 ) F (r )\n(3)\nwhere Yl ,m (\u03c6 ,\u03b8 ) is a spherical harmonic with orbital quantum number l (l = 0,1,2,....)\nand azimuthal quantum number m ( \u2212 l \u2264 m \u2264 l ).\nIt can be easily shown from Eq. (1) and (2) that the differential equations for the radial\npart F (r ) inside and outside the dot are just the equations of spherical ordinary and modified\nBessel functions, jl (r ) and k l (r ) , respectively. The solutions, which are finite at the center of\nthe dot (r = 0) and tend to zero when r increases indefinitely are given by\n- inside the dot:\n\n3\n\n\fF (r ) = A jl (\u03b1 r ) = A\n\n\u03c0\nJ 1 (\u03b1 r ) ; with \u03b1 = E\n2\u03b1 r l + 2\n\n(4)\n\n- outside the dot:\nm SiO2\n\u03c0\nK l + 1 (\u03b2 r ) ; with \u03b2 = \u03b3 (V0 \u2212 E ) , \u03b3 =\n2\n2\u03b2r\nm Si\n\nF (r ) = B k l (\u03b2 r ) = B\n\n(5)\n\nwhere J l + 1 (\u03b1 r ) is the Bessel function of the first kind and K l + 1 (\u03b2 r ) is the modified\n2\n\n2\n\nBessel function of the second kind. The normalization coefficient B is defined from the\ncontinuity condition imposed on the wavefunction at the dot surface: B = A jl (\u03b1 R ) k l (\u03b2 R ) .\nFrom the normalization of the wavefunction, A is given by\nR\n\nA = (T1 + T2\n\n) \u22121 / 2 ,\n\nwhere T1 =\n\n\u222b [ jl (\u03b1 r )]\n\n2\n\n0\n\nr2\n\nj (\u03b1 R )\ndr , T2 = l\nk l (\u03b2 R )\n\n2\u221e\n\n[\nk l (\u03b2 r )]2 r 2 dr\n\u222b\n\n(6)\n\nR\n\nTo determine the energy levels in the dot, we use the transcendental equation resulting\nfrom the boundary condition imposed on the derivative of the wave-function at the dot\nsurface, i.e., by taking into account the change in effective mass between Si and SiO2,\njl ' (\u03b1 R ) =\n\n1 jl (\u03b1 R )\nk l ' (\u03b2 R )\n\u03b3 k l (\u03b2 R )\n\n(7)\n\nUsing the following formulas for derivatives\njl ' (r ) = jl \u22121 (r ) \u2212\n\nl +1\nl +1\njl (r ) ; and k l ' = \u2212k l \u22121 (r ) \u2212\nk l (r )\nr\nr\n\n(8)\n\nwe get the following equation from which the discrete values of electron energy\nE = \u03b1 2 = V0 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u03b3 can be obtained:\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u03b2 k l \u22121 \u03b3 (V0 \u2212 \u03b1 2 ) R (l + 1)\n\uf8ee\u03b1 j (\u03b1 R ) (l + 1) \uf8f9\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03b3 \uf8ef l \u22121\n\uf8fa\nR \uf8fb\nR\nk l \u03b3 (V0 \u2212 \u03b1 2 ) R\n\uf8f0 jl (\u03b1 R )\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(9)\n\nNote that, if we ignore the difference of electron effective mass between the different\nmaterials, the equation (9) simplifies to\n\n\u03b1 jl \u22121 (\u03b1 R )\n\u03b2 k l \u22121 (\u03b2 R )\n=\u2212\n, with \u03b1 2 + \u03b2 2 = V0\njl (\u03b1 R )\nk l (\u03b2 R )\n\n(10)\n\nwhich has been used by various authors [11-12].\nOnce the energies El ,n = \u03b1 l2,n which satisfy Eq.

Results and discussion\nWe are interested in spherical Si-SiO2 quantum dots with typical radius R in the range\n10 \u00c5-60 \u00c5. The barrier energy V0 is 3.1 eV, and the mass ratio is \u03b3 = 1.85. However, for\npurposes of comparison and to analyse the influence of these parameters, V0 and \u03b3 have been\nconsidered to vary in the range 1 eV-30 eV and 0.1-2.5, respectively.\nWe plot in Fig. 1 the R dependence of the 1s-level for \u03b3 = 1 and for V0 = 1 eV, 3.1 eV\nand 30 eV. In Fig. 2 the V0 dependence of the same level is shown for \u03b3 = 1 and R = 8 \u00c5, 1 \u00c5,\n15 \u00c5, 30 \u00c5. These figures verify that the energy increases when the radius decreases and when\nthe barrier potential increases, which is a common feature of quantum confinement. Note that\nthe dependence on this parameters is all the stronger that the radius and the barrier energy\nbecome smaller.\nTo see the effect of the mass difference between the dot and the surrounding barrier we\ndepict in Fig. 3 the radius dependence of 1s-level for V0 = 3.1 eV \u03b3 = 0.5, 1, 2.5. It shows that\nthe energy decreases when the mass ratio is larger. A similar feature is observed in Fig. 4 for\nthe barrier potential dependence of the 1s-level (R = 30\u00c5, and \u03b3 = 0.5, 1, 1.85). We still see\nthat at given R and V0 the energy is lower when \u03b3 increases; moreover, the change of energy\nas a function of \u03b3 is all the higher that V0 is smaller.\nTo estimate quantitatively the change of the electron energy depending on whether the\ndifference of effective mass between materials is taken into account or not, we plot in Figs. 5\nand 6 the quantity E\u03b3 =1 \u2212 E\u03b3 =1.85 as a function of dot radius and barrier potential,\nrespectively. The three first levels 1s, 2p and 3d are considered in these graphs. We can see\n5\n\n\fclearly that the magnitude of the energy change is larger for small dots and small barrier\nenergies. The typical energy change is about some tens meV for large dots and reaches more\nthan 100 meV for small dots, which cannot be neglected for most practical applications.\nDespite the effective mass approximation should fail at high energy in Si, we plot in\nFig. 7 the full picture of the energy structure of a single electron quantum dot Si-SiO2 as a\nfunction of the principal quantum number n (with \u03b3 = 1, V0 = 3.1 eV and R = 30 \u00c5). It is also\nplotted in Fig. 8 as a function of the orbital number l (with V0 = 3.1 eV and R = 30 \u00c5, and both\n\u03b3 = 1 and \u03b3 = 1.85). If we use the conventional spectroscopic notation for the electron energy\nlevels, we obtain an order of energy levels quite different from that of the hydrogen atom. The\nsequence is as follows\nE1s < E 2 p < E3d < E 2 s < E 4 f < E3 p < E5 g < E 4 d < E 6h < E3s < ...\nThe difference in the order of levels between the hydrogen atom and the semiconductor\nQD is explained by the fact that in hydrogen atom the Coulomb potential is deeply singular at\nr = 0, while there is no singularity in the dot. This sequence agrees with the results reported in\nRef. 11. We can also note that the separation of the successive energy levels increases when\nthe number n increases, i.e. when we go up to the top of the dot well. This feature is quite\ncontrary to the case of a normal atom, in which the separation between energy levels of highly\nexcited states becomes smaller and smaller when n increases.\nIn Fig. 8 we can compare the energy structure in two cases: by including the materialdependence of mass in the calculation (dashed lines) or not (solid line). In accordance with\nresults presented above, the energy levels resulting from a realistic model (\u03b3 = 1.85) are lower\nthan using the simplified model (\u03b3 = 1). This situation may result in the emergence of new\nbound states which have been omitted in the simplified calculation. For example, the highly\nexcited level 6d and 9k in Fig. 8 are only observed for \u03b3 = 1.85. Additionally, the energy shift\nbeing significantly dependent on l value, one may observe a change in the sequence of levels\n(see e.g. 11n and 7g). By choosing the appropriate radius, barrier energy and mass ratio, one\ncan expect this situation to happen for lower levels.\nFinally, we would like to compare our exact calculation with the results obtained from\nan approximate numerical method developed to treat many electron systems. Fig. 9 presents\nthe radius dependence of the first energy level calculated either by our exact treatment (solid\nline) or by self-consistently solving Poisson-Schr\u00f6dinger equations using the Hartree\napproximation [10] (dashed line). In Fig. 10 the corresponding wave functions resulting from\n6\n\n\fboth methods are shown. The excellent agreement obtained for the ground state is observed\nfor higher levels as well (not shown), confirming the validity of both methods.\n\nConclusion\nWe have presented the exact calculation of energy structure of a single electron in Si\nspherical nanocrystal surrounded by SiO2 forming a square well with finite barrier potential.\nContrary to the case of simplified models used so far, the present model takes into account the\nmaterial dependence of the electron effective mass. Fast and accurate calculations can be\ncarried out to generate the energy structure for any combination of three inputs: radius of the\ndot, barrier potential of the dot and the ratio of barrier to dot electron effective mass. It is\nshown that the energy resulting from the simplified approach (with \u03b3 = 1) is overestimated for\nall states. The effect of material-dependence of electron effective mass becomes all the more\nsignificant that the quantum dot size and the barrier energy are smaller: the difference\nbetween realistic and simplified calculations of energy levels may reach more than 100 meV\nin small dots. Additionally, our calculation may result in new energy levels omitted by the\nsimplified method and in a modified order of energy levels. As a future extension of this\nwork, the basis of Bessel-like wavefunctions determined for a single electron could be\ngeneralised to treat the effect of Coulomb interaction in many-electron quantum dots. Such an\napproach should be faster to compute than the usual self-consistent Poisson-Schr\u00f6dinger\nsolver.\n\nAcknowledgement\nOne of the authors (N. H.
