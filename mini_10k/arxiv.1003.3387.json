Recently,\nthere has been an increased interest in lattice calculations of these moments (see [5\u20137] for recent reviews).\nThe structure functions are measured in deep inelastic scattering of electrons off a nucleon [8\u201319], the cross\nsection of which is factorized in terms of leptonic and\n\nhadronic tensors, \u221d l\u03b1\u03b2 W \u03b1\u03b2 . Since the electron leptonic\ntensor, l\u03b1\u03b2 , is known, the cross section provides us with\nstructure information about the target nucleon through\nthe hadronic tensor,\nW \u03b1\u03b2 = i\n\nZ\n\nd4 xeiqx hN |T [J \u03b1 (x)J \u03b2 (0)]|N i.\n\n(1)\n\nHere q denotes the spacelike four-momentum transferred\nto the nucleon from the electron through a virtual photon. The hadronic tensor is decomposed into symmetric\nunpolarized and antisymmetric polarized parts, W \u03b1\u03b2 =\nW {\u03b1\u03b2} + W [\u03b1\u03b2] :\n\n\f2\nW {\u03b1\u03b2} (x, Q2 ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212g \u03b1\u03b2 +\n\nq\u03b1 q\u03b2\nq2\n\nW [\u03b1\u03b2] (x, Q2 ) = i\u000f\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 q\u03b3\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nF2 (x, Q2 )\nF1 (x, Q2 ) + P \u03b1 \u2212 2 q \u03b1\nP \u03b2 \u2212 2 q\u03b2\n,\nq\nq\n\u03bd\n\n\u001b\nS\u03b4\n(q * S)P\u03b4\n2\ng\n(x,\nQ\n[g1 (x, Q2 ) + g2 (x, Q2 )] \u2212\n)\n,\n2\n\u03bd\n\u03bd2\n\nwith kinematic variables defined as P\u03b1 the nucleon momentum, S\u03b1 the spin normalized with the nucleon mass\nM , S 2 = \u2212M 2 , \u03bd = q * P , x = Q2 /2\u03bd, and Q2 = |q 2 |.\nThe unpolarized structure functions are F1 (x, Q2 ) and\n\n1\n\nZ\n\ndx xn F1 (x, Q2 ) =\n\n2\n0\n\ndx xn\u22121 F2 (x, Q2 ) =\n\n0\n\nF2 (x, Q2 ), and the polarized, g1 (x, Q2 ) and g2 (x, Q2 ).\nTheir moments are described in terms of Wilson's operator product expansion:\n\n(q)\n\n(4)\n\n(q)\n\n(5)\n\n(q)\n\n(6)\n\nc1,n (\u03bc2 /Q2 , g(\u03bc)) hxn iq (\u03bc) + O(1/Q2 ),\n\nX\n\nc2,n (\u03bc2 /Q2 , g(\u03bc)) hxn iq (\u03bc) + O(1/Q2 ),\n\nf =u,d\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndx xn g1 (x, Q2 ) =\n\n2\n0\n\nZ\n2\n0\n\nX\n\ne1,n (\u03bc2 /Q2 , g(\u03bc)) hxn i\u2206q (\u03bc) + O(1/Q2 ),\n\nq=u,d\n1\n\ndx xn g2 (x, Q2 ) =\n\n\u0003\n1 n X \u0002 q\ne2,n (\u03bc2 /Q2 , g(\u03bc)) dqn (\u03bc) \u2212 2eq1,n hxn i\u2206q (\u03bc) + O(1/Q2 ),\n2n+1\n\n(7)\n\nq=u,d\n\nwhere the Wilson coefficients, c1 , c2 , e1 , and e2 , are perturbatively known. The moments, hxn iq (\u03bc), hxn i\u2206q (\u03bc)\nand dqn (\u03bc) are calculable on the lattice as forward nucleon\nmatrix elements of certain local and gauge-invariant operators.\nIn addition, the tensor charge,\nh1i\u03b4q (\u03bc) =\n\n(3)\n\nq=u,d\n\n1\n\nZ\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\nM\nhP, S|qi\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b35 q|P, Si, (8)\n2(S\u03b1 P\u03b2 \u2212 S\u03b2 P\u03b1 )\n\nwhich probes the transverse spin structure of the nucleon,\nwill soon be reported by experiments [20, 21]. This quantity is calculated on the lattice in much the same way as\nthe DIS structure function moments are calculated.\nIn this paper we report our lattice numerical calculations of the following four moments of the structure functions: the quark momentum fraction, hxiq (\u03bc), the helicity fraction, hxi\u2206q (\u03bc), the tensor charge, h1i\u03b4q (\u03bc), and\ntwist-3 coefficient dq1 of the g2 polarized structure function. These are the moments that can be calculated without finite momentum transfer. For the former three moments, the momentum and helicity fractions and tensor\ncharge, we restrict ourselves to the isovector flavor combination, q = u \u2212 d, as this simplifies non-perturbative\nrenormalization. All three are non-perturbatively renormalized and readily comparable with the corresponding\nexperiments.\nThe numerical calculations of these moments use the\nlattice gauge ensembles generated by the RBC and\n\nUKQCD Collaborations with \"2+1\" flavors of dynamical domain-wall fermions (DWF). The good chiral and\nflavor symmetries of DWF make our calculations and\nanalyses straightforward: in contrast to more conventional fermion formalisms such as staggered or Wilson,\nthere is no question in defining nucleon quantum numbers, nor complications arising from explicit breaking of\nchiral symmetry. This advantage is especially important\nin non-perturbatively renormalizing the results so they\ncan be compared with experiment and phenomenology.\nIn this paper we report results from the ensembles with\nlattice cutoff a\u22121 = 1.73(3) GeV [1]. We consider two\nspatial volumes, with linear size about 2.7 and 1.8 fm\neach. The strange quark mass is fixed at a value about\n12% heavier than its physical value, and the degenerate\nup and down quark mass is varied for four values from\nabout three quarter to one fifth of the strange quark\nmass. Since we only vary the light quark mass in our\nsimulation while the strange quark mass is held fixed, in\nthe following we call the light up and down quark mass\nmf , in lattice units, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: We explain our computational method in Sec. II. In Sec. III\nwe first summarize the numerical lattice QCD ensembles\nused for this work. Then we discuss in detail the known\nsystematic errors in the relevant form factors calculated\non these ensembles. The numerical results are presented\nin section IV. Finally, we give the conclusions in Sec. V.\n\n\f3\nWe note that some preliminary results from this study\nwere presented in Refs. [22\u201324].\n\nII.\n\nFORMULATION\n\nWe refer the reader to our recent publications [25\u201327]\nand references cited there in for details of our computational method. Here we give a brief summary for readers' convenience. We use the standard proton operator,\nB = \u000fabc (uTa C\u03b35 db )uc to create and annihilate proton\nstates. We Gaussian-smear this operator for better overlap with the ground state with both zero and finite momentum. A Gaussian radius of 7 lattice units was chosen after a series of pilot calculations. Since the up and\ndown quark mass are degenerate in these calculations,\nisospin symmetry is exact. This is of course a well-known\ngood approximation. We project onto the positive-parity\nground state, so our proton two-point correlation function takes the form\nX \u0012 1 + \u03b3t \u0013\nC2pt (t) =\nhB\u03b2 (tsink )B \u03b1 (tsource )i, (9)\n2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwith t = tsink \u2212tsource . We insert an appropriate operator\nO(~q, t0 ) at time t0 , tsource \u2264 t0 \u2264 tsink , and possibly finite\nmomentum transfer ~q, to obtain a form factor or structure function moment three-point correlation function,\n\u0393,O\nC3pt\n(t, t0 , ~q) =\n\nX\n\nTABLE I.

The chiral\nsymmetry of DWF is relied on to suppress mixing with\nlattice-artifact operators. The specific procedures for the\noperators studied in this paper have been described in\nprevious RBC publications [25, 26]. Here we summarize\nthem for the readers' convenience. First, we take the\nFourier transform of the Green's function for operator\nO\u0393 constructed from a point source propagator at the\n\nGO\u0393 (p, p0 ; a) =\n\nX\n\n=\n\nX\n\n0\n\ne\u2212ip*x+ip *y h\u03c8(x)O\u0393 (0)\u03c8(y)i, (12)\n\nx,y\n0\n\ne\u2212ip*x+ip *y hS(x, 0)\u0393S(0, y)i, (13)\n\nx,y\n5q\n5q\nq\n\u03c3q\n, O{34}\nor O[34]\n. The needed\nwhere O\u0393 is one of O44\n, O34\nFourier-transformed point-source and point-split\u2013source\npropagators are\nX\nS(p; a) =\ne\u2212ip*x S(x; 0)\n(14)\nx\n\nD\u03bc S(p; a) =\n\nX1\nx\n\n2\n\ne\u2212ip*x [S(x; \u2212\u03bc\u0302)U\u03bc (\u2212\u03bc\u0302)\n\n\u0003\n\u2212 S(x; \u03bc\u0302)U\u03bc\u2020 (0) .\n\n(15)\n\n\f4\nNext the Green's function is amputated, and evaluated\nfor the case of exceptional momenta (p = p0 ),\n\u039bO\u0393 (p; a) = hS(p; a)\u22121 iGO\u0393 (p; p; a)hS(p; a)\u22121 i. (16)\nZ RI is obtained by requiring the renormalized Green's\nfunction, after some suitable projection, be equal to its\ntree-level counterpart [28],\nZO\u0393 (\u03bc; a)\u22121 Zq (\u03bc; a) =\n\nmf\n0.005\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n\n1\nTr (\u039bO\u0393 (p; a)P\u0393 )|p2 =\u03bc2 .(17)\n12\n\nThe projectors for each O\u0393 are listed in Table I. Since we\nwish to match these renormalized operators to the perturbative MS scheme, the renormalization scale \u03bc must\nbe large enough for perturbation theory to be valid, but\nnot so large to introduce lattice artifacts. Thus \u03bc should\nsatisfy \u039bQCD \u001c \u03bc \u001c 1/a. In practice, we have found\nthat the upper bound is not so strict, and can be replaced by the milder condition that (pa)2 < 3.\nFinally, the following steps, similar to those from [26],\nallow us to convert the renormalization constants to the\ncontinuum MS scheme at 2 GeV.\n1. Obtain Z RI (\u03bc): The ratio of ZO\u0393 (\u03bc; a)/Zq (\u03bc; a) to\nZA /Zq (\u03bc; a) is computed and yields ZO\u0393 (\u03bc; a)/ZA .\nEach of the factors in the ratio is first extrapolated\nto the chiral limit, mf = \u2212mres , at fixed momentum. Using ZA = 0.7161 [1], we can determine\nZO\u0393 (\u03bc; a) in Eq. (17), the renormalization constant\nin the RI scheme, which we denote as Z RI .\n2. Convert to MS scheme: We are interested in continuum quantities, mostly calculated in the MS\nscheme. The conversion factors between RI and\nMS schemes for the operators discussed here have\nbeen calculated in Refs. [30, 31]. To get Z MS (\u03bc),\n(3)\nwe use \u03b1s (\u03bc) obtained by numerically solving\nthe renormalization group equation with the fourloop anomalous dimension [32] and initial condition\n(5)\n\u03b1s (mZ ) = 0.1176 [33], following the method in\nAppendix A of Ref. [34].\n3. Running to 2 GeV with two loop anomalous dimensions [31] [35]. This will take away the continuum\nrunning factor.\n4. Remove (ap)2 lattice artifacts: We fit the remaining\nmomentum dependence, which we will observe to\nbe very small, to the form f = A(ap)2 + B and\nfinally get Z MS (2GeV).\n\nIII.\n\nTABLE II. Nconf , Nsep and Nmeas denote number of gauge\nconfigurations, trajectory separation between measurements,\nand the number of measurements on each configuration, respectively, on the 243 ensembles. The table also lists the pion\nand nucleon mass for each ensemble [27].\n\nENSEMBLES\n\nWe follow the same sampling procedure as in our nucleon form factor calculations reported in Ref.

We carry out\nextra measurements on a subset of these (286 configurations) to\nimprove the statistics using different source positions.\nTwo measurements with the double-source method gives\neffectively four measurements.\n\nA.\n\nStatistics\n\nThe RBC-UKQCD joint (2+1)-flavor dynamical DWF\nensembles [1] are used for the calculations. These ensembles are generated with Iwasaki gauge action [36] at the\ncoupling \u03b2 = 2.13 which corresponds to the lattice cutoff\nof a\u22121 = 1.73(3) GeV, which is determined from the \u03a9\u2212\nbaryon mass [1].\nThe dynamical up, down and strange quarks are described by DWF actions with fifth-dimensional extent of\nLs = 16 and the domain-wall height of M5 = 1.8. The\nstrange quark mass is set at 0.04 in lattice units and\nturned out to be about 12% heavier than the physical\nstrange quark, after taking into account the additive correction of the residual mass, mres = 0.00315. The degenerate light quark masses in lattice units, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02\nand 0.03, correspond to pion masses of about 0.33, 0.42,\n0.56 and 0.67 GeV and nucleon masses, 1.15, 1.22, 1.38\nand 1.55 GeV.\nTwo lattice sizes are used for our study, 163 \u00d7 32 and\n3\n24 \u00d764, corresponding to linear spatial extent of approximately 1.8 and 2.7 fm, respectively. The smaller volume\nensembles, calculated only with the heavier three light\nquark masses, are used for a finite-volume study. On the\n163 ensembles we use 3500 trajectories separated by 5 trajectories at mf = 0.01 and 0.02, and by 10 at 0.03. The\nmain results are obtained from the larger volume ensembles with the number of the configurations summarized\nin Table II.\nOn the larger volume, at the heavier three quark\nmasses we make four measurements on each configuration with the conventional single source method using\ntsrc = 0, 16, 32, 48, or 8, 19, 40, 51. At the lightest mass\nthe double-source method [27] is used, and two measurements on each configuration are carried out using the\nsource pairs of (0, 32) and (16, 48), or (8, 40) and (19, 51).\nWe made an additional two measurements on roughly\nhalf of the configurations with one or the other source\n\n\f5\npair. This means that we make four, double-source measurements on almost half of the configurations, while two\ndouble-source measurements are carried out on the remaining configurations.\nOn the smaller volume, a single source is used, however\nthe location of this source is shifted for each successive\nmeasurement in the order (x,y,z,t)=(0,0,0,0), (4,4,4,8),\n(8,8,8,16), (12,12,12,24), reducing autocorrelations.\nIn order to reduce possible auto-correlations among\nmeasurements, they are averaged on each configuration\nand then blocked into bins of 40 trajectories for the 243\nensembles, and 20 trajectories for the 163 ensembles. The\nstatistical errors are estimated by the jackknife method\non the blocked measurements.\nFinally, the non-perturbative renormalization constants were computed on the four 243 ensembles, on\nroughly 50 configurations each, separated by 40 trajectories. The maximum momentum value in units of 2\u03c0/Li\nin each direction was 6 (spatial) and 17 (temporal), such\nthat (pa)2 < 3.\n\nB.\n\nCorrelation functions\n\nThe quark propagator is calculated with an antiperiodic boundary condition in the temporal direction,\nand periodic boundary conditions for the spatial directions. We employ gauge-invariant Gaussian smearing [37, 38] at the source with smearing parameters\n(N, \u03c9) = (100, 7) which were chosen after a series of pilot\ncalculations. For the calculation of the three-point functions, we use a time separation of 12 time slices between\nthe source and sink operators to reduce effects from excited state contributions as much as possible.\n\nC.\n\nSystematic errors\n\nThere are several important sources of systematic error\nthat need be considered: finite spatial size of the lattice,\nexcited state contamination, and non-zero lattice spacing. A chiral-perturbation-theory-inspired analysis of the\nformer for meson observables suggests the dimensionless\nproduct, m\u03c0 L, of the calculated pion mass m\u03c0 and lattice linear spatial extent L, should be set greater than 4\nto ensure that the finite-volume correction is negligible\n(below one percent), and the available lattice calculations\nseem to support this. While our present parameters satisfy this condition, we discovered that even our larger\nvolume of (2.7 fm)3 is insufficient for calculating such important nucleon properties as the axial charge [39] and\nform factors [27]: As we reduce the light quark mass,\neventually to m\u03c0 = 330 MeV and m\u03c0 L \u223c 4, finite-size\neffects become severe, exceeding 10 %, at least for these\nquantities that are measured in elastic processes. Similar\nfinite-size effects may influence the moments of structure\nfunctions we are discussing in this paper (studies of finite\nvolume effects in chiral perturbation theory can be found\n\nFIG. 1. A nucleon observable, isovector quark momentum\nfraction, hxiu\u2212d , from RBC 2-flavor dynamical DWF ensemble with mud = 0.02 [26], with source-sink separation of 10\nand 12: a clear systematic difference is seen. The shorter\nsource-sink separation is not manifestly free of excited-state\ncontamination.\n\nin [40, 41]). On the other hand since these moments\nare extracted from experimental observables measured\nin very different inelastic processes, the finite-size effect\nmay enter differently. It is an important goal of this work\nto investigate such finite-size effects on the moments of\nstructure functions.\nIn order to reduce contamination from excited states,\nit is important to adjust the time separation between the\nnucleon source and sink appropriately so the resultant\nnucleon observables are free of contamination from excited states. The separation has to be made longer as\nthe quark mass is decreased. In our previous study with\ntwo dynamical flavors of DWF quarks [26] with a similar\nlattice cutoff of about 1.7 GeV, we saw systematic differences between observables calculated with the shorter\ntime separation of 10, or about 1.16 fm, and longer 12,\nor 1.39 fm: the differences amount to about 20 %, or\ntwo standard deviations (see Fig. 1.) This would suggest\nthat at the shorter time separation of about 1.2 fm, the\nexcited-state contamination has not decayed sufficiently\nto guarantee correct calculations for the ground-state observables [23]. While it is desirable to use a longer separation, it cannot be made too long in practice without\nlosing control of statistical errors. In Fig. 2 we present\nthe nucleon effective mass at the lightest quark mass,\nmf = 0.005. The nucleon signal begins to decay at\nt = 12, or about 1.4 fm: this is about longest distance we\n\n\f6\n1\n\n0.9\n\nEff. mass of CG(t,0)\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nexperiment\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n\u3008x\u3009u-d\n\u3008x\u3009\u2206u-\u2206d\n\n0.5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nt\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nFIG. 2.

As will be shown in\ndetail in this paper, the bare three-point function signals\nfor this source-sink separation of t = 12 are acceptable.\nWe note that recently the LHP Collaboration has also\nlooked at this issue in some detail [42] and ends up using\na shorter separation of about 1.2 fm.\nFor low energy quantities like the pseudoscalar decay constants, the kaon B-parameter, and the \u03a9 baryon\nmass, the effect of non-zero lattice spacing was estimated\nto be less than 4% for the configuration ensemble used\nin this work [1], and subsequently confirmed on a later\nensemble with smaller lattice spacing [43, 44]. We expect that similar errors hold for the quantities discussed\nin this paper.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nQuark momentum and helicity fractions\n\nLet us first discuss the ratio, hxiu\u2212d /hxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d , of the\nisovector quark momentum fraction to the helicity fraction. The momentum fraction, hxiu\u2212d , which is the first\nmoment of the F1,2 unpolarized structure functions, and\nthe helicity fraction, hxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d , which is the first moment\nof the g1 polarized structure function, share a common\nrenormalization because they are related by a chiral rotation and the DWF action preserves chiral symmetry to\na high degree. Thus, this ratio calculated on the lattice is\nnaturally renormalized, much like the form factor ratio\n[27], gA /gV , and is directly comparable with the value\nobtained from experiment.\nThe results of our calculation are shown in Fig. 3.\nThey do not show any discernible dependence on the\nup/down quark mass, outside of the statistical error bars,\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n2.7 fm\n1.8 fm\n\n0.2\n0.3\n2\n2\nm\u03c0[GeV ]\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 3. Ratio of the bare, isovector, momentum and helicity\nfractions, hxiu\u2212d /hxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d , which is naturally renormalized\nfor DWF. Both volumes are shown, (2.7 fm)3 (circles) and\n(1.8 fm)3 (squares). The square symbols have been moved\nslightly in the plus x-direction. They are in good agreement\nwith experiment which is denoted by the star. No discernible\ndependence on volume nor pion mass can be detected.\n\nand are in good agreement with experiment. This is\nin contrast to the renormalized ratio of gA /gV of elastic form factors which at the lightest point deviates significantly from heavier mass results and the experiment\nas a result of a large finite-size effect [27]. This suggests the moments of inelastic structure functions such\nas the momentum fraction, hxiu\u2212d , and helicity fraction,\nhxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d , may not suffer so severely from the finite-size\neffect that plagues elastic form factor calculations. Indeed the results obtained from the smaller (1.8 fm)3 volume, also shown in Fig. 3, do not deviate significantly\nfrom the constant behavior of the larger volume results,\nalbeit with larger statistical errors.\nNext we discuss the absolute values of the isovector\nquark momentum fraction, hxiu\u2212d . This is the first moment of the unpolarized structure functions, F1 and F2 .\nIn Fig. 4, we show the bare lattice matrix elements as\nratios of three- and two-point functions for the two lightest quark mass values of mf = 0.005 (circles) and 0.01\n(squares). We extract bare values of the desired matrix\nelement by averaging over time slices 4 to 8 (values are\nsummarized in Tables IV and V).\nThese bare values need be renormalized in order to\nbe compared with experiment. In Fig. 5 we present\nthe non-perturbatively determined renormalization for\nq\nthe operator O44\n. The filled circles are the renormalization constants in the RI-MOM scheme at scale \u03bc2 = p2 ,\nwhich is not scale independent.

II, we obtain a renormalization factor of\nMS\nZhxi\n(2 GeV) = 1.15(4).\nq\nUsing this renormalization constant, the quark-mass\ndependence of the momentum fraction is shown in Fig.\n6. The results from the smaller (1.8-fm)3 volume for\nthe heavier three quark mass values are in agreement\nwith respective mass-value results from the larger volume.

This behavior is not so different from\nold RBC quenched results [25] and other recent ones [7]\nwith similar up/down quark mass.\nOn the other hand, the lightest point on the larger\n(2.7 fm)3 volume, shows a sign of deviation away from\nthis constant behavior. In contrast to the form factor\ndeviations that move away from experiment [27], this one\ntrends toward the experimental value. Since a lighter\nquark can more easily share its momentum with other\ndegrees of freedom, this trending toward the experiment\nmay well be a real physical effect: It is not necessarily a\nresult of the finite spatial size of the lattice.\nIndeed, it is noteworthy that the m\u03c0 L value of 3.8\nfor mf = 0.01 at L = 1.8 fm is smaller than that of\n4.5 for mf = 0.005 at L = 2.7 fm. In other words,\nif there would be such a finite-size effect for this quark\nmomentum fraction that scales with m\u03c0 L as seen in the\nform factors, the result from mf = 0.01 at L = 1.8 fm\nshould move away from that of mf = 0.005 at L = 2.7 fm.\nWe note that in [40] it was predicted that finite volume\neffects in hxiu\u2212d would only become noticeable for very\nlight quark masses.\nThe isovector quark helicity fraction, hxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d , appears as a leading twist moment of the polarized structure functions g1 and g2 . Figure 7 presents typical bare\nsignals of this quantity on the larger (2.7-fm)3 volume,\nfor the light-quark mass points mf = 0.005 and 0.01.\nAverage values are extracted as for the momentum fraction, described above. Results are summarized in Tables\nIV for the larger volume and Table V for the smaller\nvolume.\nThe non-perturbative renormalization of hxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d\n5q\n(for the operator O{34}\n), is presented in Fig. 8.

No finite volume effect\nis apparent in the data, similar to the quark momentum\nfraction. The three heavier-mass results from the smaller\nvolume again agree with the respective larger-mass re-\n\nFIG. 9. The renormalized quark helicity fraction, hxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d .\nBoth volumes are shown, (2.7 fm)3 (circles) and (1.8 fm)3\n(squares). The square symbols have been moved slightly in\nthe plus x-direction for clarity.\n\nsults, suggesting the huge finite-size effect, seen in the\nelastic form factors, that appears to scale with m\u03c0 L, is\nnot present in this moment of this deep-inelastic structure function, at least at the quark masses considered\nhere.\nMoreover, the observable exhibits very similar quarkmass dependence to the momentum fraction, as can be\nexpected from the near constant behavior of their ratio:\nthe three heavier points stay roughly the constant and\nabout 70 % higher than the experimental value, and the\nlightest point shows a sign of deviation away from this\nconstant behavior. This trend toward the experimental\nvalue may be a real physical effect.\nHere, we note that while our results of hxiu\u2212d are\nin agreement with nf = 2 Wilson results [45], they\ndiffer significantly from the LHP mixed-action calculations [46]. Their values are significantly lower, by about\n20 %. The main source of this discrepancy is likely\ndue to the use of perturbative renormalization by the\nLHP Collaboration. In the LHP mixed-action calculations [46], the renormalization constant is evaluated by\nnon\u2212pert.\nZO = (ZO /ZA )pert. \u00d7 ZA\nfor the operator O.\nIn the same manner, we use the value of (ZO /ZA )pert.\n5q\nnon\u2212pert.\nfor the operator O{34}\nfrom Ref. [47] and ZA\n=\n0.7161(1) from Ref. [1], and evolve it to a renormalization scale of 2 GeV using the two-loop anomalous dimension [26, 31], obtaining the renormalization factor\nZhxi\u2206q (2GeV) = 0.873(34) in the MS scheme.\nIf we use this renormalization factor instead of the nonperturbative one described earlier, as shown in Fig. 10,\nour results will be consistent with the LHPC results.\nThe difference between the non-perturbative and perturbative renormalization factors suggests a systematic\nerror of about 25% should be assigned to the latter. Fur-\n\n\f9\nthermore, those lightest points in both quark momentum\nand helicity fractions are quite close to the experiments,\nwhile the non-perturbatively renormalized ones are significantly away from the experiments. This indicates\nthat the perturbative calculation of the renormalization\nconstants significantly underestimates the renormalized\nvalue of these particular quantities, and then exhibits an\naccidental consistency with the experiments.\nAs mentioned before, it is observed that there is a\nnoticeable nonlinearity in the data of both hxiu\u2212d and\nhxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d . These trends toward the experimental values are easily seen in Fig. 11, where the (2+1)-flavor\nand previous RBC quenched [25] and 2-flavor [26] results\nare plotted together with the leading nonlinear behavior predicted in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory\n(HBChPT) [48\u201350].\n\u0014\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\n2\n3gA\n+1 2\nm\u03c0\nhxiu\u2212d = C 1 \u2212\nm\u03c0 ln\n2\n(4\u03c0F\u03c0 )\n\u03bc2\n2\nm\u03c0\n+e(\u03bc2 )\n(18)\n(4\u03c0F\u03c0 )2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n2g 2 + 1\nm2\u03c0\nhxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d = C\u0303 1 \u2212 A 2 m2\u03c0 ln\n(4\u03c0F\u03c0 )\n\u03bc2\n2\nm\u03c0\n(19)\n+\u1ebd(\u03bc2 )\n(4\u03c0F\u03c0 )2\nAlthough our lightest point may be beyond the applicability of HBChPT 1 , the downward trends are expected to\ndevelop at least in the vicinity of the physical pion mass\npoint. As a simple prediction, the curve is shown using\nexperimental values for the nucleon axial charge and pion\ndecay constant, gA = 1.269 and F\u03c0 = 92.8 MeV, a chiral\nscale \u03bc = mN = 940 MeV, and by setting the unknown\nlow energy constants to zero, e(\u03bc) = \u1ebd(\u03bc) = 0. The\nvalues in the chiral limit are obtained by requiring the\ncurves to agree with experiment at the physical point. It\nis interesting to note that the quenched results show no\nhint of this behavior, while the 2-flavor ones are inconclusive. We remind the reader that for the 2-flavor data,\na smaller time separation between sources, tsep \u2248 1.16\nfm, was used. When the separation was increased for the\nlightest mass, the momentum and helicity fractions drop,\nbut with a significant increase in the statistical error.\nThe physical point values hxiu\u2212d = 0.218(19) and\nhxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d = 0.256(23), determined by simple linear chiral extrapolation of the three lightest points, overshoot\nthe experimental values by more than 2-3 standard deviations as shown in Fig. 12. On the other hand, nonlinear\nfit forms motivated by HBChPT,\nhxiq,\u2206q (m2\u03c0 ) = c0 + c1 * m2\u03c0 + d1 m2\u03c0 log(m2\u03c0 ),\n\n(20)\n\ncan easily accommodate all four data points and produce\nextrapolations to the physical point, in agreement with\n\n1\n\nIt can be observed in some particular cases like the nucleon\naxial charge gA and the nucleon root-mean-squared (rms) charge\nradius [26, 27].\n\nthe respective experimental values, albeit with large statistical errors. Although this indicates a favorable trend,\ndefinitive results require simulations with several lighter\nquark masses than our lightest one. All fits are summarized in Table VII.\n\nB.\n\nTransversity (Tensor charge)\n\nResults for the bare isovector tensor charge, h1i\u03b4u\u2212\u03b4d ,\nare presented in Fig. 13, and in Fig. 14 we present its\nnon-perturbative renormalization constant. We obtain a\nrenormalization factor of Z MS (2GeV) = 0.783(3).\nCombining them we obtain the renormalized tensor\ncharge as presented in Fig. 15 and summarized in Table VI. These provide a rough physical prediction which\nis still worthwhile since the experiments are yet to report\na value. If we fit the heavy three points with a constant\nwe obtain a value of about 1.10(7). Alternatively if we\nlinearly extrapolate the two lightest points we would obtain about 0.7.\n\nC.\n\nTwist-3 moment\n\nFigure 16 presents the bare lattice signals for the twist3 moment, d1 , of the polarized structure function g2 .\nThey are summarized in Table VIII.\nWe have not yet computed the renormalization constant for this quantity. The quark-mass dependence of\nthe bare values are presented in Fig. 17. Our interest\nhere is in whether the perturbatively obtained WandzuraWilczek relation [51] holds. From the smallness of the\nvalues obtained, we conclude it does. We note that\nour results indicate that the lightest mass points deviate\nslightly from the linear trends set by the heavier points.\nIn Fig. 18 values on different volumes are compared.\nd1 appears to be insensitive to finite volume effects, at\nleast in this range of light quark masses.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented calculations of some of the lowest\nmoments of nucleon structure functions in (2+1)-flavor\nQCD, using domain wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge\naction. The calculations were carried out on two volumes\nat a single lattice spacing (a\u22121 = 1.73 GeV) with quark\nmasses that yield pion masses in the range 0.33 to 0.67\nGeV. The results are encouraging.\nThe ratio of the bare quark momentum and helicity\nfractions, which is automatically renormalized, is found\nto be independent of the light quark mass through the\nrange of our calculations, 15 mstrange \u2264 mud \u2264 43 mstrange ,\nand agrees with the value obtained from experiment\nwithin statistical error. This is in contrast to a similarly\nautomatically renormalized ratio, gA /gV , of the isovector\naxialvector and vector charges that is severely distorted\n\n\f10\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\n\u3008x\u3009u-d\n\n0.3\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.15\n0.1\n\nexperiment\n\nNf=2+1 DWF (with Non-Pert.

Comparison with previous RBC quenched [25] and 2-flavor [26] results. The left triangles denote 2-flavor points with\na time separation between source and sink of 12 sites instead of 10 (down triangles). Dashed curves show the leading order\nbehavior in HBChPT in the vicinity of the physical pion mass point.\n\nby the finite size of the lattice [27, 39] at the lightest\nquark mass.\nThis suggests the corresponding downward trend toward the experimental values, as the quark mass decreases, of both the momentum, hxiu\u2212d , and helicity,\nhxi\u2206u\u2212\u2206d , fractions is a real physical effect. Comparison of these results on two different volumes supports\nthis observation. In fact, all of the moments studied here\nagree well, within statistical errors, on two different volumes, (2.7 fm)3 and (1.8 fm)3 .\nIn addition to the momentum and helicity fractions, the non-perturbatively renormalized tensor charge,\nh1i\u03b4u\u2212\u03b4d , has been computed. The chiral extrapolation,\n\nin particular, needs to be understood before an accurate\nprediction can be made. Since upcoming experiments\nhave yet to report a value, we give a rough estimate,\nfrom two different chiral extrapolations, that its value\nlies in the range 0.7-1.1.\nThe twist-3 moment of the g2 structure function, d1 , is\nalso obtained. Though yet to be renormalized, its smallness suggests the Wandzura-Wilczek relation holds.\nThe possibility that the long sought curvature of the\nmoments in the chiral regime is becoming visible in our\nresults has encouraged us to start calculations at even\nsmaller quark masses (m\u03c0 \u2248 250 and 180 MeV), on an\neven larger lattice (L \u2248 4.5 fm).
