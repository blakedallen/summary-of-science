Later Sheth\n& Tormen (1999, hereafter ST) refined the PS mass function by taking into account the nonspherical collapse. The ST mass function has been tested against many N-body simulations,\nshowing good agreements (e.g., Reed et al. 2003). This success of the ST mass function\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nimplies the validity of the hierarchical merging scenario since it was originally derived under\nthe assumption that the CDM halos form through hierarchical merging.\nYet it is premature to assert that the formation of CDM halos is always hierarchical\nover the entire mass range given the fact that the validity of the ST mass function was\nrather limited to the relatively high- mass section (> 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 ). Results from N-body\nsimulations still suffer from the lack of information on the low-mass section (\u2264 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 )\ndue to the resolution limit.\nVery recently, Mo et al. (2005) came up with a new halo-formation scenario where\nthe formation of low-mass halos is somewhat anti-hierarchical, preceded by that of massive\npancakes. According to their model, the preheated medium caused by the gravitational\npancaking effect suppresses the star-formation sufficiently in the low-mass halos, which can\nexplain the observed low HI-mass as well as the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction.\nAlthough the work of Mo et al. (2005) was focused on explaining the suppression of\nstar-formation in the low-mass halos, we note that if the formation of low-mass halos was\nindeed preceded by the formation of massive pancakes, what is suppressed should not be\nonly the star-formation but also the formation of low-mass halos itself. To take into account\nthe break in the hierarchical process and to predict the abundance of low-mass halos more\naccurately, it is desirable to have an analytic model for it derived from first principles.\nOur goal here is to construct an analytic model for the low-mass halos that form through\nanti-hierarchical fragmentation of massive pancakes. To achieve this goal, we adopt the\nZel'dovich approximation as a simplest footstep which generically predicts the formation of\npancakes, and we follow the standard PS approach to count the abundance of dark halos\nas a function of mass. The hypotheses, the mathematical layout and the predictions of our\nmodel are presented in \u00a72, and the summary and discussion of the final results are provided\nin \u00a73.\n2.\n\nANALYTIC FORMALISM\n\nIn the Press-Schecther formalism (Press & Schechter 1974, hereafter, PS), an isolated\ndark halo (a halo just collapsed) of mass M forms from the regions in the density field whose\naverage density contrast \u03b4 \u2261 \u2206\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 (\u03c1\u0304: the mean mass density of the universe) smoothed\non the mass scale of M reaches some critical value, \u03b4c . The value of the critical density \u03b4c\nis approximately 1.68, which depends very weakly on the background cosmology and the\nredshift (Kitayama & Suto 1996).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe Gaussian probability distribution of the linear density contrast smoothed with the\nsharp k-space filter on the mass scale M is given as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ ln kc\n\u03b42\n1\n2\nexp \u2212 2 , \u03c3 (M) \u2261\np(\u03b4) = \u221a\n\u22062 (k) d ln k, M = 6\u03c0 2 \u03c1\u0304 kc\u22123 ,\n(1)\n2\u03c3\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere \u03c3(M) is the rms density fluctuation, and \u22062 (k) is the dimensionless power spectrum.\nThroughout this Letter, we use the power spectrum of the concordance \u039bCDM cosmology\nwith \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9b = 0.044, h = 0.7 (Bardeen et al. 1986).\nIn the Zel'dovich approximation (Zeldovich 1970, hereafter, ZEL), the mass density is\ngiven as\n\u03c1\u0304\n\u03c1=\n,\n(2)\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb1 )(1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )(1 \u2212 \u03bb1 )\n\nwhere \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 (with \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 \u03bb3 ) are the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor dij\ndefined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential \u03a6: dij \u2261 \u2202i \u2202j \u03a6. Doroshkevich\n(1970) derived the joint distribution of the three eigenvalues:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3375\n3I12 15I2\np(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ) = \u221a\n(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )(\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 )(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb3 ),\n(3)\nexp \u2212 2 +\n\u03c3\n2\u03c3 2\n8 5\u03c0\u03c3 6\nwith I1 \u2261 \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 and I2 \u2261 \u03bb1 \u03bb2 + \u03bb2 \u03bb3 + \u03bb2 \u03bb3 .\nEquation (2) implies that the mass-density diverges along the direction of the major\nprincipal axis of the deformation tensor if the largest eigenvalue reaches unity and the intermediate and the smallest eigenvalues are less than zero. In other words, an isolated pancake\n(a two-dimensional object just collapsed only along the first principal axis) of mass M forms\nif the following condition is satisfied: \u03bb1 = \u03bbc , \u03bb2 < 0, \u03bb3 < 0 with \u03bbc = 1 on the mass scale\nM.\nNow that the conditions for the formation of isolated halos and pancakes are specified,\nwe would like to find the probability that a halo at present epoch was embedded in a\npancake at some earlier epoch before it formed. For this, it is required to have the joint\ndistribution of the linear density and the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor on two\ndifferent scales on two different epochs. Let \u03b4 be defined at present epoch on the galactic\nmass scale Mg , and let \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 be defined at some earlier epoch of redshift z > 0 on the\nlarger mass scale Mp > Mg . The rms density fluctuation at redshift z on mass scale Mp is\ngiven as \u03c3(Mp , z) = b(z)\u03c3(Mp ) where b(z) is the growth factor of the linear density that is\nnormalized to satisfy b(0) = 1.

The halo mass Mg observed at present epoch is set at the dwarf galactic scale\nMg = 106 h\u22121 M\u2299 , and three different cases of the pancake's mass Mp are considered: Mp =\n108 h\u22121 M\u2299 (dashed); Mp = 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 (solid); Mp = 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (long dashed). As can be\nseen, the value of p(\u03bb\u20321 = \u03bbc , \u03bb\u20322 < 0, \u03bb\u20323 < 0|\u03b4 \u2265 \u03b4c ) is twice higher than that of p(\u03b4 \u2032 = \u03b4c |\u03b4 \u2265\n\u03b4c ) at z \u223c 2 for the case of 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 \u2264 Mp \u2264 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nFigure 2 also plots the two probabilities as solid and dashed lines. In this Fig. 2 the\npancake's mass is set at Mp = 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 , and the four different cases of the halo mass\nMg are considered in separate panels: Mg = 106 h\u22121 M\u2299 (upper left); Mg = 107 h\u22121 M\u2299\n(upper right); Mg = 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 (lower left); Mg = 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 (lower right). As shown, the\nprobability distribution p(\u03bb\u20321 = \u03bbc , \u03bb\u20322 < 0, \u03bb\u20323 < 0|\u03b4 \u2265 \u03b4c ) has a maximum value around\nz = 2, position of which shifts to the low-redshift section as the halo mass Mg increases. For\nall four cases of Mg at z \u223c 2, the value of p(\u03bb\u20321 = \u03bbc , \u03bb\u20322 < 0, \u03bb\u20323 < 0|\u03b4 \u2265 \u03b4c ) is consistently\nhigher than that of p(\u03b4 \u2032 = \u03b4c |\u03b4 \u2265 \u03b4c ). The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 imply that the halo\nof mass Mg \u2264 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 observed at present epoch are more likely to have been embedded\nin massive pancakes of mass Mp \u2248 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 around z = 2 rather than formed through\nhierarchical merging.\nSetting the typical mass scale and redshift for the formation of pancakes at 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299\nand z = 2, respectively, we follow the standard PS approach to evaluate the mass distribution\nfunction of the low-mass halos that formed anti-hierarchically. According to the theory the\ndifferential number density of the dark halos in the mass range [M, M + dM] is related to the\nvolume fraction F occupied by the proto-halo regions in the linear density field that satisfy\na specified collapse condition:\ndN\n\u03c1\u0304\n\u03c1\u0304 dF\nd\u03c3\n=A 2\n\u2261A\ndM\nM dM\nM d ln M\n\n\u2202F\n,\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n(9)\n\nwhere A is the normalization factor, which is exactly 2 in the original PS theory (Peacock\n& Heavens 1990; Bond et al. 1991; Jedamzik 1995).

The normalization factor A\nin equation (9) is determined from the constraint that our mass function on the mass scale\nM = 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 should give the same value as that of the ST formula which is known to\nagree very well with N-body simulation in the mass range M \u2265 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nFigure 3 plots our result (solid), and compares it with the original PS (dotted) and the\nST (dashed) mass functions. As can be seen, our model predicts less number of low-mass\nhalos when compared with the PS and the ST mass functions. That is, the formation of lowmass halos is suppressed by the earlier formation of massive pancakes. Our mass function\nis found to be well fitted by a power-law, dN/dM \u2248 M \u22121.86 , which is shallower than the PS\nand the ST ones, dN/dM \u2248 M \u22122.1 . This shallow shape of our mass function in the low-mass\ntail is consistent with the recent high-resolution simulation (Yahagi et al. 2004).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nBy taking into account the possibility that the low-mass CDM halos form through antihierarchical fragmentation of the massive pancakes, we have derived a new analytic mass\nfunction for the low-mass halos in the \u039bCDM cosmology with the help of the Zel'dovich\napproximation and the Press-Schechter mass function theory. It has been shown that our\nmass function has a shallower slope in the low-mass tail and predicts maximum five times\nless abundance of dwarf galactic halos of mass 106 h\u22121 M\u2299 than the currently popular ShethTormen formula.\nThe concept of broken-hierarchy should modify not only the mass function but also the\nother halo statistics from the previous models that were constructed under the assumption\nthat the halo formation is perfectly hierarchical. For instance, the two-point correlation\nof dwarf galactic halos would be different in the broken-hierarchy scenario, which in turn\nimplies the mass-to-light bias on the dwarf galactic scale would be altered in accordance.\nOur future work will be in the direction of investigating the effect of broken-hierarchy on the\nhalo n-point correlations and the mass-to-light bias as well.\nSince our mass function has been derived analytically from first principles without introducing any fitting parameters, one may not expect it to be very realistic. The formation\nof low-mass halos should be dominated by complicated non-linear processes which cannot\nbe described by using first principles alone. However, as it is the first attempt to model the\nbroken hierarchy which can accommodate future refinements, it is concluded that our model\nwill provide a useful guideline for the theoretical study of the effects of broken hierarchy on\nthe structure formation.\nThis work is supported by the research grant No. R01-2005-000-10610-0 from the Basic\nResearch Program of the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nREFERENCES\nBardeen, J.
