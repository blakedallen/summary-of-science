Introduction\nThe idea of the instanton-dominated QCD vacuum appeared shortly after the discovery of the instanton [1]. In particular, the instanton gas picture [2] populates the vacuum with well-separated instantons which, using\nsemiclassical methods, leads to the possible qualitative resolution of the\nU (1) problem [3], as well as to the conclusion that QCD physics depends\non the \u03b8-parameter [4]. However, it became clear very soon that QCD is\nnot semiclassical in this sense because the instanton gas picture does not\nlead to confinement. In fact, it has been argued by Witten [5] that large\nquantum fluctuations entirely destroy the semiclassical vacuum and that\nindividual instantons do not play a significant dynamical role in QCD.\nThe fundamental importance of instantons thus became clearly questionable, but the instanton solution served as a basis for a phenomenological Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) [6]. While there are correlations among\nILM instantons, the ILM vacuum is still a dilute medium where the instantons of size \u03c1 \u2248 1/3 fm and density n = 1 fm\u22124 preserve their identity. It is\nthus possible to associate a 't Hooft \"would-be\" zeromode with an individual instanton. The mixing of these modes and a formation of \"topological\nsubspace\" of low-lying modes is a basis for an elegant mixing scenario for\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (S\u03c7SB) [7]. Our goal will be to examine whether this effective picture can be recognized in the low-lying Dirac\nmodes and thus whether one should assign a fundamental significance to\nit. The main conclusion from this study is that this is not the case [8] and\nthat the ILM picture is not microscopically accurate.\nOur approach is entirely based on studying the local properties of the\nfermionic eigenmodes [8, 9]. This is entirely appropriate if one's goal is to\nstudy the effects of topological charge fluctuations on S\u03c7SB. The underlying rough gauge fields are not manipulated in any way, while the fermionic\ndynamics generates the appropriately smooth behavior automatically. Consequently, this represents an unbiased approach to study the possible dynamical relevance of ILM instantons, as well as the applicability of the\ntopological mixing scenario in general.\nThe nature of the questions we ask can be described by starting from the\nILM picture of the vacuum, or from any picture with vacuum populated by\nindividual instantons preserving their identity. In a typical configuration,\nthere is a collection of smooth (anti)self-dual potential wells for (right)lefthanded components of the fermion. In Fig. 1(A) we show schematically the\nsection of the instanton potential in a direction of another instanton. The\npotential is truly instanton-like around the core with modifications close to\nedges due to interactions. The corresponding left-handed 't Hooft modes\nare shown as well. In equilibrium QCD configuration there are certainly\n\n\f3\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\nFigure 1. Short-distance fluctuations (rough line) imposed on the instanton-like gauge\npotential (smooth solid line) and its possible effects on 't Hooft modes (dashed line). See\ndiscussion in the text.\n\nadditional short-distance fluctuations present. However, these do not necessarily affect the low-momentum propagation of light quarks significantly.\nIndeed, the infrared Dirac modes filter out the ultraviolet fluctuations that\nare not important for low-energy fermion dynamics [8]. It would thus be\ninteresting to determine which of the following physically distinct possibilities takes place: (I) The strength and nature of quantum fluctuations\nis such that the structure of t' Hooft \"would-be\" zeromodes can still be\nidentified in the true eigenmodes as represented in Fig. 1(B). In this case\nthe ILM scenario for S\u03c7SB could indeed be microscopically accurate. (II)\nQuantum fluctuations deform the 't Hooft modes to the extent that their\noriginal structure can not be recognized anymore (see Fig. 1(C)), but the\nunit quantization of topological charge still takes place in the QCD vacuum.\nIn this case the ILM scenario would not be accurate and it is questionable\nwhether the underlying gauge structures should be referred to as \"instantons\". However, as pointed out in Ref. [8], the subspace of topological modes\nwould nevertheless be created and thus the basic mechanism proposed in\nthe context of ILM would be operating. (III) Quantum fluctuations are so\nstrong that they destroy unit lumps. In this case a new microscopic origin\nof Dirac near-zeromodes needs to be sought.\nWe will present data which rules out option (I) and strongly suggests\n\n\f4\n\n\u03b2\n5.85\n6.00\n6.20\n6.55\n\na [fm]\n\nV\n\n0.123\n0.093\n0.068\n0.042\n\n3\n\n10 x20\n144\n204\n324\n\n# configs\n12\n12\n8\n5\n\nTABLE 1. Ensembles of Wilson gauge configurations.\n\nthat (II) is not applicable either. Since this talk has been given, the possibility (II) has been excluded directly [10], leaving us with option (III).\n2. Structures in the Eigenmodes of the Overlap Operator\nThe microscopic viability of the ILM picture for S\u03c7SB can in principle\nbe verified on the lattice by inspecting the local structure of low-lying\nDirac modes [9]. In the absence of exact chiral symmetry this should be\napproached with some care, but since chirally symmetric fermionic actions\nare now available [11], such strategy is very appropriate. We have calculated low-lying eigenmodes of the overlap Dirac operator [11] in Wilson\ngauge backgrounds over a large span of lattice spacings as summarized in\nTable 1. The physical volumes are chosen to contain on average 3\u20134 instantons and antiinstantons if the ILM scenario is relevant, ensuring that the\nmixing of 't Hooft modes would take place, and that \"topological subspace\"\nof low-lying modes would form. If that happened, then the local structure of\nthese modes would have very specific local properties related to the structure of underlying 't Hooft modes themselves. The logic of our approach is\nto assume that this is indeed the case, and to verify the consistency of such\nassumption against the true local behavior of low-lying modes. To do that,\nwe identify the \"structures\" in the low-lying modes in such a way that (a)\nthey would correspond to individual 't Hooft modes if ILM scenario was\naccurate and that (b) they can not arise accidentally as an artifact of the\nchosen procedure.\nAs a first step toward defining individual structures correspondingly, we\nstudy the X-distributions in lowest-lying near-zeromodes [9]. For a given\neigenmode \u03c8(n) the local chiral orientation parameter X(n) is defined as\ntan\n\n\u0011 |\u03c8 |\nL\n(1 + X) =\n,\n4\n|\u03c8R |\n\n\u0010\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8L , \u03c8R are the left and right spinorial components.

For modes\nin the topological subspace the probability distribution of X over the subvolumes occupied by (anti)instantons should be strongly peaked around\n\u00b11. On the other hand, if in the subvolume with strong fields the corresponding spinors were strictly unpolarized, a uniform distribution would\nresult.\nWe have calculated the lowest two pairs of near-zeromodes for the ensembles in Table 1. The corresponding X-distributions shown in Fig. 2 were\nobtained by considering the fraction f = 1/10 of the volume, where the density d(n) = \u03c8n+ \u03c8n is highest. This is plausible since the ILM estimates of\nthe instanton packing fraction range between f \u2248 1/20 to f \u2248 1/8. Also,\nthe results are quite insensitive to variations of f in the above range. The\n\n\f6\nX-distributions scale well, and a double-peaked behavior with maxima at\nX \u2248 \u00b10.65 emerges (see also Refs. [12]). As Fig. 2 shows, we do not obtain\nconvincing peaks at around \u00b11 as one would naively expect from ILM (The\ncalculated distributions for ILM ensembles are not available in the literature.). However, we use these X-distributions as a starting point to verify\nwhether the double-peak behavior is due to the existence of local structures\nresembling the ILM instantons.\nFollowing the above considerations we identify the local \"structure\" in\nthe eigenmode by specifying\n\u221a the position n of a local maximum of density\nd(m) over the distance 3, such that (i) |X(n)| \u2265 0.5, (ii) n belongs to\nthe subvolume used for calculating the X-distribution,\nand (iii) the den\u221a\nsity decays on average over the distance 3 in eight basic lattice directions [8]. This definition satisfies the criteria (a),(b) discussed above and\nthe resulting structures contribute to the maxima of the X-distribution by\nconstruction. To see whether a structure positioned at n resembles the 't\nHooft mode, we have attempted to fit the average profile of the density\ndn (r) \u2261 < d(m) >|n\u2212m|=r with the 't Hooft profile. The situation for a\ntypical structure is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the fits over different\nregions are very poor and inconsistent with one another. We were simply unable to identify space-time structures whose origin could be directly\ntraced to 't Hooft zeromodes.\n3. Sizes and Densities of the Structures\nAs a next step we wish to establish whether the density and the size of\nstructures in the eigenmodes are compatible with the ILM. In Fig. 4 we\nshow the lattice-spacing dependence of density indicating strikingly larger\nvalues than assumed in the ILM. There is a rapid growth at small lattice\nspacings and we can not exclude the potential divergence in the continuum\nlimit. This implies that the true local behavior of topological charge density\nfiltered through infrared eigenmodes is much richer than the one pictured\nin the ILM.\nFrom our discussion in the previous section it follows that the sizes\nof individual structures can not be determined from fits to the 't Hooft\nprofile (see Ref. [8] for details). We thus adopt a different procedure based\nonly on the assumption of topological mixing. In particular, the \"wouldbe\" zeromodes localized on the unit quantized gauge lumps would produce\nregions of coherent local chirality of some typical size. It is thus natural\nto assign the radius Rn to the structure at n as the radius of the largest\nhypersphere centered at n, containing the points with the same sign of\n+ \u03b3 \u03c8 . We have determined the average radius for our\nlocal chirality \u03c8m\n5 m\nensembles and the results are shown in Fig. 4.

The corresponding scale we obtain in the continuum limit\nis much smaller than the one considered in the ILM.\n4. The Consequences of the Numerical Results\nThe results from Sections 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate that the local structure of Dirac near-zeromodes for equilibrium QCD backgrounds differs significantly from the behavior associated with the ILM picture of the vacuum.\nThis conclusion does not relate only to the obvious quantitative disagreement with parameters of the ILM that we observe. Indeed, the fact that\nwe are not able to identify structures with 't Hooft profile indicates that\na generic picture where vacuum is populated by relatively independent instantons preserving their individual identity is not microscopically accurate.\nWe have thus excluded the possibility (I) of the Introduction.\nWe now consider the merit of the possibility (II), namely that quantum\nfluctuations, while deforming the ILM instantons severely, do not destroy\nthe integrity of unit topological charges. In such vacuum there would be\nidentifiable individual lumps of unit topological charge present and the\ntopological mixing scenario of S\u03c7SB would still be relevant [8].

NL would form\nif NL lumps were present in the volume. Even for general unit lumps this\nsituation implies very specific properties that can be tested.\nFirst, if a topological subspace is formed, then all eigenmodes in the\nsubspace should have very similar local properties since they are all the\ndescendants of the chiral \"would-be\" zeromodes localized on the lumps.\nAs a consequence, there should be no qualitative difference in this regard\nbetween the zeromodes and the near-zero modes belonging to the subspace [9]. The X-distribution is an ideal tool for testing whether this is the\ncase or not. In Fig. 5 we compare the X-distribution for two pairs of nearzeromodes from our ensemble at \u03b2 = 6.55 (our finest lattice spacing) to the\nX-distribution for the zeromodes [8]. Instead of qualitative agreement, we\nclearly observe a very abrupt change in the behavior of the near-zeromodes.\nAt the same time, the topological mixing scenario predicts that there\nshould be a sudden qualitative change in the local behavior at the point\nin the spectrum where the topological subspace ends. In particular, the\nX-distribution should be much less peaked (or not peaked at all) for eigenmodes outside the topological subspace. The number of unit topological\nlumps NL (i.e. the dimension of the topological subspace) can be estimated\n\n\f10\n\nmode 1,2\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n1500\n1000\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\n2000\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1500\n1000\n\n0\n-1\n\nmode 7,8\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nmode 9,10\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n500\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\n2500\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\n2500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nmode 15,16\n\n2000\nCount (at 10%)\n\n2000\nCount (at 10%)\n\n2000\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\nX\n\n0.5\n\nmode 17,18\n\n1500\n1000\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\n0.5\n\nmode 19,20\n\n2500\n2000\nCount (at 10%)\n\n1\n\n500\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n2500\n\n0\n\nmode 11,12\n\n1000\n\n2500\n\n500\n\n1\n\n0\n-1\n\nmode 13,14\n\n1000\n\n0.5\n\n1500\n\n2500\n\n1500\n\n0\nX\n\n500\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n\n2500\n\n1500\n\nmode 5,6\n\n500\n\n0\n-1\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n2500\n\n500\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\nmode 3,4\n\n2500\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\nCount (at 10%)\n\nbeta=6.2 config 8\n2500\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\nX\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFigure 6.

For several\nconfigurations we have calculated up to 20 near-zeromodes to make sure\nthat the dimension of the topological subspace could be identified. In Fig. 6\nwe illustrate the typical behavior by displaying results for configuration 8\nfrom our \u03b2 = 6.2 ensemble. This configuration has Q = 0 and we show the\nX-histograms for 10 pairs of near-zeromodes (the histogram is the same\nfor both modes in a pair). Inspecting these results reveals that there are at\nleast 14 modes with similar double-peaked structure instead of 3\u20134. Moreover, the decrease in double-peaking appears to be gradual and there is\nevery reason to expect that higher modes will be peaked as well.\nThe above considerations show quite clearly that the idea of the distinctive topological subspace being the source of the low-lying eigenmodes\ngenerating the finite average microscopic density around zero (and hence\nS\u03c7SB [13]) is not consistent with our data. This suggest that the logical\npossibility (II) described in the Introduction is probably not what happens\nin the true vacuum of pure gauge QCD.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this work we have demonstrated that the ILM scenario for S\u03c7SB is not\nmicroscopically accurate. In particular, the low-lying Dirac modes cannot\nbe described as mixtures of 't Hooft modes associated with ILM instantons.\nMore generally, our data suggests that the bulk of topological charge in\nQCD is not effectively concentrated in quantized unit lumps to which it\nwould be possible to assign the corresponding \"would-be\" zeromodes. Since\nthis talk has been given, this suggestion has been put on a firm ground and\ndemonstrated directly in Ref. [10]. Our findings imply that a qualitatively\ndifferent mechanism for the origin of the Dirac near-zeromodes should be\nsought.\nAcknowledgment\nIH thanks the organizers of the workshop for a very well-organized, informative, and exceptionally pleasant meeting.
