INTRODUCTION\n\nCharacteristically intense nuclear emission in radio galaxies, along with the highly collimated jets powered by accretion onto their central engines, can influence star formation, excitation and ionization of the ISM, as well as provide kinetic stresses on the hot X-ray emitting coronal gas\nthat pervades clusters of galaxies (Quillen & Bower 1999;\nMcNamara et al. 2000; Blanton et al. 2001; Reynolds et al.\n2002; Ruszkowski & Begelman 2002). Narrow-band imaging surveys of radio galaxies at redshifts z > 0.6 were among\nthe first studies to establish such a connection, having shown\nthe optical line-emitting gas (T \u223c 104 K) near the nuclei of\nthese objects to spatially align with the radio jet axes on kiloparsec scales (Fosbury 1986; Hansen et al. 1987; Baum et al.\n1988; McCarthy 1988; Baum et al. 1990). This so-called\n'alignment effect' has been attributed to shocks induced by\n1 Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated\nby the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under\nNASA contract 5-26555\n2 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive, Baltimore,\nMD 21218; grant@stsci.edu\n3 INAF-Istituto di Radioastronomia, Via P.

While these shocks can trigger star formation along the regions of the ISM excited into line emission (Chambers et al. 1987), more recent work has suggested\nthat feedback from the AGN may also play a role in ultimately quenching the star formation rate (SFR) in the late\nstages of the host galaxy's evolution, thereby ushering its\nrapid passage from the 'blue cloud' to the 'red sequence' (e.g.,\nCowie et al. 1996; Bell et al. 2004; Faber et al. 2007, and references therein). Work is ongoing in reconciling the seemingly competing roles of AGN feedback in both inducing,\nthen possibly truncating star formation at successive stages\nof galactic evolution (e.g., Silk & Rees 1998; Fabian 1999;\ndi Matteo et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2005; Silverman et al.\n2008). Regardless, it is clear that the AGN and its host galaxy\nshare codependent evolutionary paths (e.g., Magorrian et al.\n1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000), and\nthat studies of the ionized nuclear gas in radio galaxies, as\nunique probes of the early universe, will be key to understanding this relationship on size and time scales small and large.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has undertaken systematic surveys of the 3CR catalog of radio galaxies in the UV\n(Allen et al. 2002), optical (Martel et al. 1999; de Koff et al.\n2000; Privon et al. 2008), and near-infrared (Madrid et al.\n2006; Donzelli et al. 2007; Tremblay et al. 2007; Floyd et al.\n2008). These programs, in concert with a robust array of\nground-based observations of the 3CR in nearly all wavelength regimes, have established a uniform database of crossspectrum imaging and spectroscopy for a sample that is nearly\ncomplete with redshift and flux limit, unbiased with respect\nto optical/IR wavelengths, and containing galaxies exhibiting\na variety of intrinsic characteristics. The completeness and\ndiversity of the sample has enabled studies into radio-loud\nunification models and the dichotomy between relatively low\npower, edge-darkened Fanaroff and Riley class I radio galax-\n\n\f2\n\nTREMBLAY ET AL.\n\nies (hereafter FR I, Fanaroff & Riley 1974) and higher power,\nedge-brightened FR II radio galaxies (Chiaberge et al. 2000,\n2002). HST observations of the 3CR have also led to discoveries of new optical and IR jets (Floyd et al. 2006), a trend\nbetween nuclear dusty disk inclination and host galaxy isphotal shapes (Tremblay et al. 2007) and face on disks with optical jets (Sparks et al. 2000). Jet/disk orientations were studied\nat unprecedented spatial resolution (e.g., Schmitt et al. 2002;\nVerdoes Kleijn & de Zeeuw 2005; Tremblay et al. 2006, and\nreferences therein). Allen et al. (2002) also found complex\nUV morphologies unlike those seen in quiescent hosts, indicative of ongoing star formation.\nIn this paper we present narrow-band emission line observations of 19 nearby (z < 0.3) 3CR radio galaxies imaged at\nlow- and high- excitation with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard HST. These images of the warm optical\nline (H\u03b1 and [OIII]\u03bb5007) emitting gas present in the nuclei\nof the radio galaxies in our sample offer the highest sensitivity\nand spatial resolution yet available in the HST 3CR database.\nThis enables detailed studies of shocked and star-forming regions of the ISM in relation to radio jets, providing the already\nrich 3CR dataset with a larger framework from which to study\nthe various phenomena discussed above.\nWe organize this paper as follows. In \u00a72 we describe these\nHST observations in detail, and in \u00a73 we discuss the associated data reduction. In \u00a74 we present the H\u03b1+[NII] (lowexcitation) and [OIII] (high-excitation) emission line images,\nas well as qualitative descriptions of each. We also provide\nemission line luminosity results and an associated discussion.\nWe summarize this work and discuss future studies enabled by\nthis new dataset in \u00a75. Throughout this paper we use H0 = 71\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.27, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73.\n2. SAMPLE SELECTION & OBSERVATIONS\n\nIn this paper we present 19 radio galaxies from the lowredshift (z < 0.3) extragalactic subset of the Revised Third\nCambridge Catalog (3CR, Bennett 1962b,a; Spinrad et al.\n1985). 3CR sources are selected by radio flux density at 178\nMHz, at which extended, unbeamed lobes are detected irrespective of the radio jet's orientation with respect to the line of\nsight. The sample is therefore free from orientation bias and is\nnearly complete with redshift, providing a strong framework\nfor statistical analysis important for studies of (e.g.) radioloud unification models. Moreover, the sample consists of\nradio galaxies that exhibit a wide variety of characteristics\n(size, shape, jet morphology, radio luminosity, FR type, dust\ncontent, etc.), allowing for physical comparisons to be made\namong properties intrinsic to various species of radio-loud\nAGN. We select the low-redshift subset of the 3CR so as to\nachieve the highest possible spatial resolution, in addition to\nrequiring the H\u03b1 line to be within the redshift range of high\nsensitivity to provide uniform line ratio mapping.\nOf the 116 extragalactic 3CR sources with z < 0.3, 98 were\nawarded for observation in the Cycle 15 ACS snapshot program 10882 (PI: Sparks). The remaining 18 targets that were\nnot requested in our proposal were excluded for various reasons, mainly due to emission line data already being present\nin the archive for that object. Ultimately, 20 of our awarded\ntargets were observed prior to failure of ACS side two electronics in January 2007. Of these observations, 19 were successful. Our observation of 3C 371 was carried out but unsuccessful due to failure of guide star acquisition, resulting\nin unusable data. The sample consists of 4 FR I radio galaxies, 12 FR II radio galaxies, and 3 targets exhibiting compact\n\nF IG . 1.- Redshift distribution of the low redshift (z < 0.3) extragalactic\nsubset of the 3CR sample (116 galaxies), compared with the distribution of\ntargets successfully imaged (prior to ACS failure) as part of the ACS snapshot program presented in this paper (solid, 19 galaxies). While this dataset\nrepresents a small fraction of the underlying sample, it spans nearly the entire\nrange of redshift. Collectively, the vast majority of the underlying sample has\nbeen imaged as part of past HST programs in the UV, optical, and near IR.\nSee \u00a71 for a summary of these HST programs.\n\nsteep spectrum (CSS) or undiscernible radio morphology.\nWhile only a small subset of our initially proposed sample\nwas observed, the nature of HST's snapshot mode means that\nobservations were scheduled by convenience with respect to\nHST's other programs at the time, and not by any selection\neffect. Our group of galaxies is therefore as unbiased as the\n3CR itself. Moreover, the 19 galaxies successfully observed\nspan nearly the whole redshift range (0.0075 < z < 0.224, see\nFig. 1) of the underlying sample and, as we will discuss in\nmore detail in \u00a74, includes galaxies exhibiting a wide array of\nemission line characteristics.\nOur 19 successful observations consist of ACS Wide Field\nChannel (WFC) exposures of the H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII]\u03bb5007\nemission lines using narrow-band (2% bandpass) linear ramp\nfilters (LRFs) at wavelengths adjusted according to the redshift of the target (see Table 1). The LRFs aboard ACS feature effective central bandwidths that vary as the filter is rotated across the FOV. While the LRFs are useful in providing\nthe observer narrow-band imaging capabilities at a wide variety of central wavelengths, there is a drawback in that the\ntarget is imaged monochromatically only over a small region\n(\u223c 40\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 80\u2032\u2032 ) of the instrument's FOV. In planning the observations for this dataset, we ensured that the target galaxy\nnuclei always corresponded to the very center of this region.\nWith each target fully observed in one orbit, an exposure\ntime of 2 \u00d7 200 s and 2 \u00d7 250 s was used for the H\u03b1 and [OIII]\nlines, respectively, with a two point dither pattern (of line\nspacing 0\u2032\u2032 .145) to aide cosmic ray and hot pixel rejection.\nSo as to facilitate continuum subtraction from the emission\nline images, a 60 s, single pointing exposure was taken with\na medium (9%) bandpass ramp filter centered at rest-frame\n5500 \u00c5, covering a region of the optical spectrum absent of\nsignificant contamination from line emission. Subarrays were\nused to increase the efficiency of these observations, allowing\n4 images to be stored in the ACS buffer at once. The WFC\non ACS consists of two 2048 \u00d7 4096 pixel CCDs (WFC1 and\nWFC2), each with a plate scale of 0\u2032\u2032 .049 per pixel and a field\n\n\fHST EMISSION LINE IMAGING OF RADIO GALAXIES\n\n3\n\n3C 234\nTemplate spectra convolved with passbands\n(counts scale arbitrary)\n\nH\u2212alpha+[NII]\nFR782N\n\n[OIII]\nFR551N\n\nContinuum\nFR647M\n\nF IG . 2.- A representative example of our filter selection strategy. We have convolved template LINER (chosen only for example H\u03b1 and [N II ] lines) and QSO\n(for [O III ]) spectra through the filters chosen for our observations of 3C 234 (z = 0.18) as an example.

See Table 1 for an observation log related to this program.\nIt is important to note that, for all \"H\u03b1 imaging\" presented\nin this paper, the bandpass used was contaminated by [NII]\nemission at 6548 and 6583 \u00c5. References to H\u03b1 will therefore read \"H\u03b1+[NII] \" throughout this paper. Though it is\nbeyond the scope of this work to subtract this contamination,\n[NII] flux does not impact the results presented in this paper\nin any way as we present all corellations with respect to\nH\u03b1+[NII] and never H\u03b1 alone. In follow-up papers providing\nanalysis of these data, however, new ground-based optical\nspectroscopy of the 3CR by Buttiglione et al. (2009) may\nbe used to better quantify the contribution of [NII] through\neach H\u03b1 bandpass. The Buttiglione spectra, obtained using\nthe Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), may be convolved\nwith the spectral response of the HST ACS ramp filters,\nproviding a constraint on the relative strength of H\u03b1 and\n[NII] in the filter throughput. In doing this, one must take\ninto account the fact that the TNG spectra are extracted from\na 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 region, while many of our galaxies (e.g., 3C 33)\nare far more extended. In Fig. 3 we plot the de-reddened\nflux ratios from Buttiglione et al. (2009) of the diagnostic\nline [NII]\u03bb6584 to H\u03b1, vs. redshift, for each galaxy in our\nsample (with the exception of 3C 132). The results from\nButtiglione et al. (2009), some of which are apparent in\nFig. 3, show that the relative contributions of [NII] and H\u03b1\nvary widely from source-to-source, and that [NII] appears to\ndominate in most high-excitation galaxies (HEG, see Table 2).\n11\n\nBoffi, F.R., et al. 2007, \"ACS Instrument Handbook\", Version 8.0, (Baltimore: STScI).\n\n3. DATA REDUCTION\n\nHere we describe the steps taken to produce data that has\nbeen calibrated, cleaned of cosmic rays (CRs) and hot pixels,\nand finally subtracted of contamination from continuum emission. The HST On-the-Fly Recalibration (OTFR) pipeline utilizes pre-launch (ground) flats in the reduction of ACS LRF\nimages, the use of which can contribute upwards of 7% uncertainty to reduced data given the evolution of the instrument in\nthe years since launch. By reducing each image \"manually\",\nwe are able to avoid introducing this uncertainty, as well as\nimplement a more proactive approach to cleaning the images\nof CRs and hot pixels, particularly in the case of the singlepointing continuum images for which automated CR rejection\nvia combination of dithered images is not possible. For these\nreasons the images presented in this paper have been reduced\nindependently of the OTFR pipeline, in a process we describe\nbelow.\n3.1. Calibration\n\nThe calibration stage begins with the raw exposures and\ncorrects for flat-fielding, bias and dark levels, as well as absolute sensitivity. Each of these corrections is performed by the\nIRAF12 routine calacs (in stsdas.hst_calib.acs).\nSo as to avoid the uncertainty that would otherwise have been\nintroduced by the use of pre-launch flats in the OTFR pipeline,\nwe updated the PFLTFILE header keyword for each raw image\nto specify that the newest available flat be utilized for each\ncalacs run.\n12 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory,\nwhich is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f4\n\nTREMBLAY ET AL.\n\nTABLE 1\nO BSERVATION L OG\nSource\n(1)\n\nz\n(2)\n\nObs.

Here we\nplot de-reddened flux ratios of the diagnostic line [N II ]\u03bb6584 to H\u03b1 vs. redshift. The flux ratios are from the ground-based optical spectroscopy performed by\nButtiglione et al. (2009) using the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). The results from that work show that the relative contributions of [N II ] and H\u03b1 vary\nwidely from source-to-source, and that [N II ] appears to dominate in most high-excitation galaxies (HEG, see Table 2). Red squares represent the four FR Is in\nour sample, while blue circles are FR IIs and green triangles represent those objects exhibiting a CSS or unclassified radio morphology. 3C 132 is excluded from\nthis plot as no TNG spectroscopy was available for this object.\n\n\f6\n\nTREMBLAY ET AL.\n\nF IG . 4.- A representative example of our iterative masking process for cleaning each image of cosmic rays and hot pixels. (Top left) Calibrated (by calacs,\nsee \u00a73.1) single-pointing H\u03b1+[N II ] exposure of 3C 33, one of two exposures that are combined during the multidrizzle process to produce a single image (as\ndescribed in \u00a73.3). (Top right) One of the two CR and hot pixel masks created for the exposure presented at (Top left) by the cosmicrays routine, as discussed\nin \u00a73.2. This mask was used to specify locations on the exposure in (Top left) at which to linearly interpolate across bad pixel regions by neighboring good pixels,\nas described in \u00a73.2. In this representation, the bad pixels are displayed as black. (Bottom left) The same exposure as in (Top left) after two iterations of the\nCR/hot pixel cleaning process with the bad pixel masks. (Bottom right) The combined drizzled H\u03b1+[N II ] image of 3C 33, using the two dithered exposures (one\nof which is presented at Bottom left) that have been cleaned prior to the use of multidrizzle by our iterative masking process. These images are significantly\ncleaner than those provided by the OTFR pipeline, particularly in the case of the single-pointing continuum images. See \u00a73 for more information.\n\nIn selecting the appropriate new flat to use (in lieu of the\nold ground flats used by the OTFR pipeline) we employ the\nsame strategy that was used when the original ground flats\nfor the ramp filters were created. That is, LRF flats are interpolated from flats for ACS narrow, medium, and broad-band\n(i.e. non LRF) filters that correspond most closely with the\nredshift-adjusted wavelength of the emission line (or continuum) being imaged. The minor difference in central wavelength, throughput, and bandwidth of these (non LRF) filters\ncorresponds to negligible differences in their corresponding\nflat fields (less than the \u223c 7% uncertainty introduced in using\nthe old ground LRF flats).\nWith the replacement flats chosen on a case-by-case basis and the image headers updated to reflect these changes,\nthe calacs routine was run for each image, producing calibrated FITS files (one for the continuum exposure, and two\neach for the H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] exposures) that have been\nflat-fielded and corrected for bias, dark current, and absolute\nsensitivity. It is upon these calibrated images that cosmic ray\nand hot pixel rejection was performed, as we discuss in the\nfollowing section.\n3.2. Cosmic ray and hot pixel rejection\n\nThe\nNOAO\nIRAF\ntask\ncosmicrays\n(noao.imred.crutil) was run on copies of the science\nframes of each calibrated exposure (one for the continuum\nimage, two each for the H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] images) to\nidentify CRs and hot pixels. The routine identifies cosmic ray\nevents by a detection algorithm based on a mean flux comparison within a specified detection window. A pixel within this\n\nwindow whose value is higher than a user-specified threshold\ndependent upon the mean value of its neighbors is considered\n\"bad\", and flagged for cleaning by the routine. Once the\nlist of cosmic ray and hot pixel candidates is established\nover the whole image, cosmicrays replaces flagged pixels\nwith the mean value of its four neighbors. A \"cleaned\"\noutput file is then generated. We were careful to ensure that\ncosmicrays did not mis-identify real features (particularly\ngalaxy nuclei or other physical, bright features) as CRs or hot\npixels. The routine's parameters were adjusted if this was the\ncase.\nThe \"cleaned\" output from cosmicrays is insufficient\nfor our needs, as the routine will often simply \"dull\" the CR\nrather than truly replace it. This is because cosmicrays\nflags pixels within a detection window that often contains\nneighboring pixels that are also affected by the CR (and\nare therefore far brighter than the true background). In the\nworst instances, depending on the parameters that are chosen,\ncosmicrays can sometimes reconstruct the very CR it was\nattempting to mask.\nTherefore, we utilized the \"cleaned\" output from\ncosmicrays only as an intermediate step towards the\ncreation of a bad pixel mask for each exposure. To that end,\nwe divided the original, uncleaned copy of the calibrated\nscience frame with the \"cleaned\" output from cosmicrays.\nThe divided image was then examined by eye, and blinked\nwith the uncleaned frame so as to qualitatively assess the success of cosmicrays in identifying offending pixels. The\nbad pixel mask was then created from the divided image, in\nwhich pixels whose values were above a specified threshold\n\n\fHST EMISSION LINE IMAGING OF RADIO GALAXIES\n\n7\n\n3C 33\n\nH\u2212alpha+[NII] + Continuum\n\nContinuum subtracted\n\nF IG . 5.- A \"before and after\" example result from our continuum subtraction process. (a) Reduced FR716N H\u03b1+[N II ] image of 3C 33, contaiminated by\ngalaxy continuum. (b) The same image, with galaxy continuum subtracted via the method discussed in \u00a73.5\n\ndictated those that were to be masked in the uncleaned image.\nThis threshold was decided qualitatively for each image\nbased on our assessment of the success of cosmicrays\nin distinguishing truly bad pixels from real features. Often,\naccepting every flagged pixel from the divided image into\nthe final mask would result in masking healthy pixels on the\ngalaxy itself. If this appeared to be the case, the \"allowance\nthreshold\" was set above the values of the incorrectly flagged\npixels in the divided image, so that they were not made part\nof the final mask. We paid particular attention to flagged\npixels within the immediate vicinity of the target galaxy, and\nensured on a case-by-case basis that the pixels being masked\nwere indeed CR events or hot pixels and not real features\nin the galaxy. This was accomplished through blinking\nindividual exposures or by comparing the continuum image\nto archival HST data from e.g. WFPC2 in the few cases where\nthe correct choice was not obvious.\nThe mask was then used with the fixpix task to linearly\ninterpolate values for masked pixels based on those of their\nnearest unmasked neighbors. While this is in effect similar\nto the procedure employed by cosmicrays, it is more robust in that fixpix is better able to replace a CR event with\npixels generally consistent with that of the true background.\ncosmicrays, on the other hand, will often simply \"dull\"\nthe CR rather than truly replace it, as it flags pixels within a\ndetection window that often contains neighboring pixels affected by the CR (and are therefore far brighter than the true\nbackground). Moreover, the masking process allows the user\nto check at each step that no real feature on the galaxy is erroneously altered. This process was repeated several times\n(typically three times) for each calibrated science frame (one\ncontinuum exposure, two H\u03b1+[NII] frames, and two [OIII]\nframes). At each iteration in the process we varied the detection thresholds in cosmicrays, as well as the parameters\nassociated with creating the subsequent mask, in order to ensure that all CRs and hot pixels were ultimately identified and\ncleaned. In Fig. 4 we provide a representative example of the\nsteps in our cosmic ray and hot pixel rejection strategy. The\nupper-left and lower-right panels in the figure serve as a \"before and after\" comparison.\nIn two cases (3C 33 and 3C 78) a large CR event landed\ndirectly on or near to the target galaxy image in the single\n\npointing continuum exposure. In these cases we masked the\nCR while taking care to affect the galaxy light distribution as\nlittle as possible. Inevitably, some error due to pixel value\ninterpolation remains on the final reduced images (as the continuum exposure is used for both H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] in the\ncontinuum subtraction process, described in \u00a73.4). However,\nwhile this error is difficult to characterize it is unlikely that\nit has a significant effect on the ultimate science value of the\ndata, both for morphological studies of the emission-line region and for e.g. flux measurements.\n3.3. Multidrizzle\nThe calibrated, cleaned data were passed through the\nmultidrizzle routine with the default parameters. The\ntask calculates and subtracts a background sky value for\neach exposure, searches for additional bad pixels not already\nflagged in the data quality array, and drizzles the two exposures into outputs that are shifted and registered with respect to one another. From these drizzled exposures a median image is created, which is then compared with original\ninput images so as to reject the (very few) CRs not already\ncleaned in our previous CR rejection process, as we describe\nin the section above. More information on the specifics of\nmultidrizzle can be found in Koekemoer et al. (2002).\nFinal output images were left unrotated with respect to north\nto avoid pixel interpolation errors that might add uncertainty\nto our continuum subtraction and flux estimation strategies,\nwhich we describe in the sections below.\n3.4. Image Alignment\nTo facilitate continuum subtraction it was first necessary to\nalign the continuum exposures with their corresponding drizzled emission line images to ensure registration down to a\nfraction of a pixel. A first pass registration was made by\nthe world coordinate system (WCS) to achieve rough alignment of the continuum image with its companion line emission data. Subsequently, fractional shifts and rotations were\nmanually applied using foreground stars and features on the\ngalaxy as alignment aides (with the added help of the task\nimalign). Initial image registration was already well established for 8 of the 19 galaxies in our sample as their observations were carried out using the same guide stars in all (con-\n\n\f8\n\nTREMBLAY ET AL.\nTABLE 2\nO PTICAL P ROPERTIES\n\nSource\n(1)\n\nH\u03b1 Line Flux\n(\u00d710\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 )\n(2)\n\n[O III ] Line Flux\n(\u00d710\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 )\n(3)\n\nlog LH\u03b1\n(erg s\u22121 )\n(4)\n\nlog L[OIII]\n(erg s\u22121 )\n(5)\n\nIonization Class a,b\n(6)\n\nL.A.SH\u03b1\n(kpc)\n(7)\n\n3C 33.0\n3C 40.0\n3C 78.0\n3C 93.1\n3C 129.0\n3C 132.0\n3C 136.1\n3C 180.0\n3C 196.1\n3C 197.1\n3C 219.0\n3C 227.0\n3C 234.0\n3C 270.0\n3C 285.0\n3C 314.1\n3C 319.0\n3C 388.0\n3C 390.3\n\n0.428\n1.69\n2.18\n0.103\n0.12\n0.079\n0.205\n0.228\n0.149\n0.121\n0.148\n1.931\n0.941\n1.91\n0.433\n0.016\n0.027\n0.056\n11.5\n\n1.58\n1.66\n2.15\n0.070\n0.087\n0.081\n0.123\n0.488\n0.136\n0.091\n0.143\n0.569\n2.050\n2.10\n0.711\n0.070\n0.016\n0.366\n1.94\n\n39.5255\n39.0232\n39.5719\n40.2147\n38.0598\n39.9738\n39.2786\n40.4605\n40.1756\n39.6925\n40.0509\n40.5184\n40.9068\n38.3014\n39.7925\n38.7325\n39.4047\n39.0220\n40.9081\n\n40.0927\n39.0154\n39.5659\n40.0470\n37.9201\n39.9847\n39.0567\n40.7910\n40.1360\n39.5687\n40.0360\n39.9878\n41.2449\n38.3425\n40.0079\n39.6781\n39.4820\n40.1419\n40.4398\n\nHEG\nLEG\n***\n***\n***\nLEG\n***\nHEG\nLEG\nHEG\nBLRG\nHEG c\nBLRG\n***\nHEG\n***\nLEG\nLEG\nBLRG\n\n5.142\n1.259\n2.208\n3.806\n0.243\n9.77\n2.64\n16.78\n8.72\n3.04\n1.90\n21.76\n6.47\n0.63\n6.49\n3.13\n6.79\n1.98\n2.97\n\nR EFERENCES. - (a) Jackson & Rawlings (1997), (b) Buttiglione et al.

The remaining 11\nobservations included small slews of HST to allow for proper\nplacement of the galaxy image on the WFC chip (necessary\nto image at the desired LRF wavelength). In these cases guide\nstar acquisition was required between exposures. Registration\nfor these 11 targets was therefore not initially ideal, and great\ncare was taken to ensure proper alignment through manually\napplied shifts and rotations. After the appropriate shifts and\nrotations were applied, the WCS systems on the images were\nregistered with respect to one another so as to enable proper\nWCS alignment when viewing the images.\n3.5. Continuum subtraction\nHere we describe the steps taken to produce H\u03b1+[NII] and\n[OIII] line emission images that are effectively free from contamination by continuum light from the galaxy. The aligned\nimages were multiplied by their exposure times to set pixel\nvalues (in electrons per second for drizzled ACS images) to\ntotal electrons. The continuum image was then scaled by a\nfactor determined for each image on a case-by-case basis. Initially, this factor was roughly estimated using the synphot\nsynthetic photometry package (specifically calcphot) in\nIRAF. The calcphot models served as a qualitative guide\nin roughly establishing the scaling factor, which was later refined iteratively through a trial and error process that involved\nscaling and subtracting the continuum image from the line\nemission image, and examining residual pixel values on the\nresultant image in regions known to be dominated by continuum emission on the original unsubtracted data. The process was repeated until these regions possessed a mode pixel\nvalue very close to the background level (which was effectively zero, after the multidrizzle process). Ultimately, the\nabove strategies were employed in both qualitative and quantitative ways on a case-by-case basis for each image, ensuring\nthat the final subtracted image could be confidently consid-\n\nered as \"pure\" line emission within the error established by\nthe absolute photometry for this dataset. In Fig. 5 we provide\na representaive \"before and after\" comparison in the case of\ncontinuum subtraction for 3C 33.\n3.6. Emission line luminosity measurements\n\nFor each H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] image we have measured the\ntotal flux from all detected line emission in the galaxy's central regions. Emission-line fluxes were measured from the\ncontinuum-subtracted images using the apphot routines in\nIRAF. We adopted an \"all the flux you see\" approach when\nestablishing the size of the aperture with which the photometric measurement was performed. In this way, we measure\n\"total\" flux as opposed to flux through an aperture that is the\nsame across the the entire dataset.\nFor consistency, we defined a \"source region\" by heavily\nsmoothing a copy of each emission line image with a Gaussian kernel set to an arbitrarily large sigma. The aperture\nfor the measurement was then set to the radius corresponding to a reasonable contour in the smoothed image enclosing all detected line emission from the galaxy. We also defined an outer boundary beyond which the image may be nonmonochromatic (due to the ramp filters, see \u00a72 for an explanation). The region between the \"source region\" and the outer\nboundary defined the area in which the H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII]\nbackground level was measured.\nWith these regions defined using the smoothed image, the\ncorresponding regions on the original continuum-subtracted\nimages were identified. The image was then examined to establish the standard deviation of background, and the pixel\nvalues were thresholded to a value of order one sigma above\nthe background level, corresponding to \u223c 0.01 electrons per\nsecond. Counts above this threshold were considered signal\nand were counted in the photometric summation of flux values, while pixels below this threshold were read as zero and\n\n\fHST EMISSION LINE IMAGING OF RADIO GALAXIES\n\n3C 33\n\n7''\n\n3C 40\n\n7.9 kpc\n\n\u0397\u03b1\n\n4''\n\n1.4 kpc\n\n\u0397\u03b1\n\n[OIII]\n3C 78\n\n4''\n\n[OIII]\n3C 93.1\n\n2.2 kpc\n\n\u0397\u03b1\n\n4''\n\n15.2 kpc\n\n\u0397\u03b1\n\n[OIII]\n3C 129\n\n3.5''\n\n9\n\n3C 132\n\n1.5 kpc\n\n\u0397\u03b1\n\n[OIII]\n\n3''\n\n10.3 kpc\n\n\u0397\u03b1\n\n[OIII]\n\n[OIII]\n\nF IG . 6.- HST/ACS narrow-band images of the H\u03b1+[N II ] (left panel, in red) and [O III ] (right panel, in blue) line emitting regions in our sample of radio\ngalaxies from the 3CR catalog.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION\n\nIn Figs. 6 - 8 we present the continuum-free line emission\nimages listed by ascending 3C number. H\u03b1+[NII] images\nare shown to the left and are presented in orange and [OIII]\nimages are shown to the right in blue. Where possible we\nhave estimated the projected orientation of the radio jet axis\n\non the sky from high spatial resolution archival Very Large\nArray (VLA) radio maps retrieved from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED13 ), indicated by an arrow in the\ntop right corner of the galaxy's [OIII] image. This orientation\nwas qualitatively estimated from the apparent inner jet axis\nfor FR I radio galaxies, and along the hotspot-to-hotpsot axis\nfor FR II radio galaxies. See Table 3 for a summary of the\nradio properties for objects in the sample. In instances where\nthe figure does not display an estimate for the radio jet orientation, data was either not readily available, was of insufficient\nresolution to make a confident estimate, or was cospatial with\nthe source on galactic scales (i.e. morphologically similar to\nCSS sources).\n4.1. Description of individual sources\nIn the subsections below we discuss the observed morphology of the high surface brightness H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] line\nemission detected in each galaxy. Objects are listed in ascending order by the name of the source. For information\nrelating to the observations of each of the below galaxies, see\nTable 1. For quantitative data regarding the optical and radio\n13\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n\f10\n\nTREMBLAY ET AL.\n\nproperties of each object, see Tables 2 and 3, respectively. All\nimages discussed below are presented in Figs. 6, 7, and 8.\n4.1.1. 3C 33; z = 0.059\n\nExtended regions of high surface brightness line emission\nare seen in both the H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] images. The lowand high-excitation regions trace a general \"integral sign\"\nshape extending \u223c 5 kpc and oriented NE to SW. In both\nimages a fainter, detached shell of low- and high-excitation\nemission is observed NE of the main \"integral sign\" feature.\nThe [OIII] features more obviously clumpy, brighter hotspots\nalong the lane of emission and near the nucleus than does\nthe H\u03b1+[NII] image. Long slit spectroscopy of the extended\nline emission obtained by Simkin (1979) and Heckman et al.\n(1985) suggested that the line emitting gas is rotating along an\naxis oriented at a position angle (P.A.) of \u223c 19\u25e6 with respect\nto the FR II radio jet axis. (Fig. 6).\n4.1.2. 3C 40; z = 0.017\n\nA dusty disk on 100 pc scales is seen in both H\u03b1+[NII] and\n[OIII] images, marked by the absence of emission along a\ncircumnuclear rim that is more prominent in the [OIII] image than it is in H\u03b1+[NII] . Low- and high-excitation line\nemission is seen tracing the edges of the disk on the southern\nside, while [OIII] emission on the northern side of the disk\nappears less extensively distributed. The band marking the\ndisk is not continuous, rather in both images it is interrupted\nby low-surface brightness line-emission apparently connecting the southern and northern sides of the disk in the same\ngeneral location. Note that the apparent major axis of the\ndisk appears roughly orthogonally oriented with respect to the\nFR II radio jet axis. (Fig. 6).\n4.1.3. 3C 78; z = 0.028\n\nAn optical jet is seen in both H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] emission to extend from the core in a northeasterly direction (projected on the sky). The bright, unresolved nucleus in both images is surrounded by a generally isotropic region of narrowline emitting gas in both H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII]. Sparks et al.\n(2000) noted the presence of a face-on dusty nuclear disk in\nthis FR I radio galaxy. Both distributions appear slightly more\nextended in the plane perpendicular to the optical synchrotron\nradio jet axis described by Sparks et al. (1995). Perlman et al.\n(2006) notes the presence of an emission line knot cospatial\nwith the radio jet axis. That we apparently detect both highand low-excitation emission along the jet axis may be an important result, and is worthy of future study. (Fig. 6).\n4.1.4. 3C 93.1; z = 0.244\n\nA compact distribution of narrow-line emitting gas is seen\nsurrounding the nucleus and extended \u223c 3.8 kpc primarily towards the NE. The lopsided morphology observed in both the\nH\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] emitting gas is evidence of the presence\nof an anisotropic nuclear ionizing radiation field. 3C 93.1 is a\nCSS source. (Fig. 6).\n4.1.5. 3C 129; z = 0.021\n\nNarrow-line emission associated with 3C 129 is only\nmarginally detected in both filter configurations. Compact\nH\u03b1+[NII] emission with very low surface brightness is observed to be cospatial with the nucleus. Conversely, the nucleus is not detected in the [OIII] image, where instead only\nvery faint extended emission that appears to be associated\nwith the nucleus extends 1\u2032\u2032 to the north and south. 3C 129 is\none of the four FR I radio galaxies in our sample (Fig. 6).\n\n4.1.6. 3C 132; z = 0.214\n\nA bright nucleus surrounded by fainter, more diffuse emission is observed in both H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] images. The\nnucleus appears fainter in [OIII] and what appears to be a\nfaint \"hotspot\" is located directly to the north of the nucleus.\n(Fig. 6).\n4.1.7. 3C 136.1; z = 0.064\n\nIn H\u03b1+[NII] , an elongated nucleus is seen with major axis\noriented north-south on the sky. Faint, disjoint distributions\nof narrow-line gas surround the nucleus in two filamentary\nplumes extending from the core along a N-S axis roughly perpendicular to the FR II radio jet axis. Clumpy patches of disparate, low-surface brightness emission are observed at radii\nof \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 . In [OIII] there is an apparent double nucleus with\nhotspots more clearly separated than in the H\u03b1+[NII] image.\nThe north-south filaments seen in H\u03b1+[NII] are not detected\nin [OIII]. (Fig. 7).\n4.1.8. 3C 180; z = 0.220\n\nA bi-conical series of shells is observed in both\nH\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII], reminiscent of other bi-conical NLR\nmorphologies observed in some Seyfert II galaxies (e.g., Mrk\n3, Mrk 573, NGC 5252, Capetti et al. 1999). At both lowand high-excitation we observe a bright, lopsided emission\nregion cospatial with the nucleus. Fainter \"plume-like\" features extend from both the northern and southern extremities\nof the extended core of emission. The bi-conical series of\nshells of emission extends \u223c 8 kpc to both the NE and SW\nof the core. The abundance of optical line emitting gas along\na preferred axis suggests the presence of a highly anisotropic\nionizing radiation field. 3C 180 lacks a Fanaroff-Riley classification, and we are unable to characterize the morphology\nof its radio source in any meaningful way given the available\ndata. McCarthy et al. (1995) note that 3C 180 resides in a\ncluster. (Fig. 7).\n4.1.9. 3C 196.1; z = 0.198\n\nA high surface brightness lane of H\u03b1+[NII] emission\n\"snakes\" NE from the bright elongated core, reminiscent of a\n\"tadpole\" shape. H\u03b1+[NII] emission is also observed extending from the core along an axis perpendicular to the axis of\nelongation of the \"tadpole\"-shaped distribution of ionized gas.\nIn the [OIII], high excitation emission is observed in two localized hotspots cospatial with the elongated bright core seen\nin H\u03b1+[NII] , and the \"tadpole\" structure is not detected, nor\nis the emission along the perpendicular axis. (Fig. 7).\n4.1.10. 3C 197.1; z = 0.13\n\nBright, unresolved nuclei are seen in both images, surrounded on all sides by a fainter distribution of line-emitting\ngas. The nucleus appears larger in H\u03b1+[NII] than it does in\n[OIII]. (Fig. 7).\n4.1.11. 3C 219; z = 0.174\n\nCompact emission is seen in both bands, as is faint, diffuse emission surrounding the unresolved source at the center.\n(Fig. 7).\n4.1.12. 3C 227; z = 0.086\n\nCompact emission cospatial with the galaxy's nucleus is\nseen at both low- and high- excitation.

(1984)\nis seen in high surface brightness H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] emission. To the east is the bright quasar-like nucleus of the\ngalaxy, and in both images a bright feature is seen extending 0.5\u2032\u2032 from its northwestern edge. The overall elongation\nof the emission line region, including the tidal arm, is in a\nprojected orientation that is roughly parallel with that of the\nradio jet axis on large scales. (Fig. 8).\n\nA complex, filamentary system of dust lanes bisects the nuclear region of the galaxy in a northeasterly direction and perpendicular to the line of sight. The extinction associated with\nthe predominant lane in this system is seen in the H\u03b1+[NII] ,\nwhere we observe an extended region of high surface brightness emission with complex morphology. A bright, dense column of line-emission extends \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 northward from the nucleus at the center of the image. Slightly to the southeast a\nsmall, bright \"integral sign\" feature is seen in general alignment with the large dense column. Both of these features are\nsurrounded by fainter narrow-line emitting gas arranged in filamentary plumes as well as clumpy patches. In the [OIII] image we observe a dramatically different morphology than is\napparent from the H\u03b1+[NII] . A high surface brightness lane\nof emission \"snakes\" westward from the center of the galaxy\nto form a disjoint \"W\" shape. The nucleus of the galaxy, such\nas it is, is not discernible from the image. Bright patches of\nemission populate the prominent filament at regular intervals\nalong its length.

For a discussion on the implications of these emission line luminosity ratios, see \u00a74.2.\n\nBelow we discuss significant correlations, consistent with\nthe results of previous related studies, that are apparent in our\ndata. In \u00a74.3 we discuss the physical interpretation of these\nobserved trends, and compare our results to past literature.\n4.2.1. Emission line luminosities vs. redshift\n\nIn Fig. 9a and 9b (top left and top right, respectively) we\nplot the measured H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] luminosities (LH\u03b1 and\nL[OIII] ) vs. redshift for the galaxies in our sample. FR I radio\ngalaxies are plotted in red squares, while FR IIs are plotted in\nblue circles and the three galaxies whose radio morphologies\nare uncategorized are plotted in green triangles (this convention holds throughout this paper). As expected, the emission\nline luminosities follow a positive redshift-luminosity trend,\n\nalbeit with a greater degree of scatter than that found in the\ncanonical K \u2212 z relation for radio galaxies (where K is the\nNIR K-band magnitude of the elliptical radio galaxy host,\nsee Willott et al. 2003 for a detailed study of this correlation).\nThis higher degree of scatter is not necessarily surprising for\na number of reasons, some of which we summarize below:\n1. Warm optical line emitting gas in radio galaxies is naturally expected to inhabit a greater range in luminosity space than are the NIR starlight distributions of\ntheir elliptical hosts. As the stellar component of radio galaxies is believed to have formed at high redshift\nand evolved passively in the time since (barring other\neffects), a tight clustering of K-band magnitudes is expected.

(2008)\nin comparison with the data presented in this paper. (a) Continuum-subtracted WFPC2 FR533N 2 \u00d7 300 s exposure of the [O III ] emission in 3C 234; (b)\ncontinuum-subtracted ACS WFC FR601N exposure of the [O III ] emission in 3C 234, from the dataset presented in this paper. See Table 2 and \u00a72 for details.\n\nof gas in the nuclei of radio galaxies, however, is subject to a number of factors that greatly influence overall\nemission line luminosities.\n2. Our sample includes low-power FR I radio galaxies,\ncharacterized by narrow-line emission, and FR II radio\ngalaxies and QSO characterized by broad optical line\nemission. Broad line radio galaxies (BLRGs) generally\nhave an optical excess, resulting in a larger contribution to emission line flux. Not surprisingly, the BLRGs\nin our sample (3C 33, 197.1, 219, 285, 234, & 390.3)\ngenerally inhabit the upper regions of Fig. 9a and 9b,\ncontributing to the overall scatter.\n3. These galaxies range in redshift from 0.0075 < z <\n0.224 and were observed with a variety of LRF filter\nconfigurations (see Table 2). This results in varying\namounts of emission line flux loss beyond the edge of\nthe passband, as well as contamination from [NII].\nIn Fig. 9c we plot our H\u03b1+[NII] luminosities in blue\nsquares vs. redshift, overplotted with the measured and extrapolated H\u03b1+[NII] luminosities for the sample of 3CR radio galaxies from Privon et al. (2008). The slightly larger\nscatter observed in the Privon data reflects the fact that\nroughly 50% of their H\u03b1+[NII] luminosities have been estimated from measured [OIII] luminosities using ratios found\nin the literature. In general, however, our galaxies follow a\nredshift-luminosity trend roughly consistent with that found\nfor the (generally) higher redshift subset of the 3CR studied\nin Privon et al. (2008). See Fig. 10 for a representative and\nqualitative comparison of WFPC2 and ACS data quality from\nthe Privon observations and this paper, respectively.\n4.2.2. Emission line ratios\n\nIn Fig. 9d (bottom right) we plot the measured [OIII]\nluminosities vs. the measured H\u03b1+[NII] luminosities for\nthe objects in our sample. Those galaxies lying above the\nblack diagonal line (tracing L[OIII] = LH\u03b1 ) possess [OIII] luminosities greater than their H\u03b1+[NII] luminosities (and viceversa). Note that, in general, LH\u03b1 and L[OIII] are roughly sim-\n\nilar across the sample, with some notable exceptions whose\nnames we have indicated in the figure.\nIn future papers it will be necessary to investigate emission\nline ratio maps, which may carry important implications with\nregards to the orientation-based unification scheme of radioloud AGN (e.g., Padovani & Urry 1992; Chiaberge 2004, and\nreferences therein). It is expected that low-excitation lines\n(like H\u03b1+[NII] ) are emitted further from the AGN than are\nhigher excitation lines like [OIII], as the fraction of highly excited gas will depend on the proximity of that gas to the ionizing source, in this case the AGN (e.g., Jackson & Rawlings\n1997, and references therein). This spatial dependence of\nL[OIII] /LH\u03b1 also leads to a dependence upon the sources of\nobscuration present in the galaxy. In the unification model\nfor radio galaxies, wherein FR Is are unified with BL-Lacs\nand FR IIs are unified as the parent population of steep spectrum QSO, we expect low-excitation gas to lie further from\nthe obscuring torus, while the fraction of high-excitation gas\nobserved will follow a tighter dependence upon the angle at\nwhich the observer views the obscuring torus. We may therefore expect that intrinsically similar radio-loud AGN viewed\nat a variety of angles will have unequal [OIII] luminosities\nbut roughly equal H\u03b1+[NII] luminosities (Baum & Heckman\n1989b; Jackson & Browne 1990).\nIt will also be important to investigate whether [OIII]/H\u03b1\nratios of order unity are indicative of Seyfert-like nebular activity. We note that, in general, the majority of objects in our\nsample with L[OIII] /LH\u03b1 6= 1 in (i.e. those galaxies significantly\noffset from the diagonal line in Fig. 9d) are BLRGs, with the\nexception of one FR I. Though we are unable to make statistically significant inferences with respect to these issues (as\nour sample consists of only 19 galaxies), further investigation\ninto these line ratios and associated line ratio maps may yield\nimportant results.\n4.2.3. Emission line luminosities vs. total radio power\n\nIn Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) we plot emission line luminosity\nvs. total radio power at 178 MHz for H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII],\nrespectively. We note a clear upward trend in both figures,\nconsistent with the results of the comprehensive study by\nWillott et al. (1999), which also found a tight correlation be-\n\n\fHST EMISSION LINE IMAGING OF RADIO GALAXIES\ntween emission line and radio luminosity in flux limited samples of radio galaxies.\nWe discuss interpretations of this result in \u00a74.3, but it is first\nimportant to frame the results of the above emission line luminosity comparisons in the context of ionized gas distribution\nmorphologies.\n4.2.4. Morphology of the extended narrow line regions\n\nThe low- and high- excitation narrow-line regions we observe in our sample, overall, exhibit extended and complex\nmorphologies characterized by (e.g.) clumpy regions of emission (e.g. 3C 33), whispy tendrils (3C 136.1, 3C 319), extended filaments and lanes (3C 196.1, 3C 234), and bi-conical\nseries of shells (3C 180). In general the morphologies observed in [OIII] mirror those in H\u03b1+[NII] with some important exceptions (e.g. 3C 136.1, 3C 196.1, 3C 227, 3C 285).\nWe also note the presence of bright unresolved nuclear emission in the cores of every object with the exception of 3C 129\nin [OIII] and 3C 285 in H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] (no clearly \"point\nsource-like\" nucleus is apparent in our images for that object).\nIn Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) we compare the projected linear\nsizes of the line-emitting regions with both redshift and elliptical host galaxy effective radius (respectively). We have\nestimated the gas distribution sizes, in kpc, from the largest\nangular extent (L.A.S.) subtended by the high surface brightness emission (as projected on the sky). While this is a rough\nestimate, it provides important insights as evidenced by the\nweak upward trend of L.A.S. with redshift (Fig. 12a), implying that larger distributions of optical line emitting gas are\nfound at higher redshifts.\nValues for the effective radii Reff in Fig. 12(b) are from\nFloyd et al. (2008) and Donzelli et al. (2007), and were derived from surface brightness profile fitting to HST/NICMOS\nH-band images (and some NIR imaging from TNG, in the\ncase of Donzelli et al. 2007). While the methods employed\nby these two studies differ, their results are generally consistent, and any uncertainty introduced in plotting results from\nboth papers is reflected in the characteristic error bars we have\nindicated in the figure. In light of these added uncertainties,\nhowever, we are unable to make any significant inferences,\nthough L.A.S. and Reff do appear weakly correlated for galaxies with Reff < 4 kpc, while no such correlation is evident for\nthose objects with Reff > 4.\n4.3. Physical interpretation of the trends observed\n\nWe have discussed three trends apparent in our data:\n1. Emission line luminosity (both for H\u03b1+[NII] and\n[OIII]) appears positively correlated with the redshift\nof the host galaxy.\n2. The H\u03b1+[NII] and [OIII] luminosities are also tightly\ncorrelated with total radio power at 178 MHz.\n3. Projected sizes of the ionized gas distributions in our\nsample are positively correlated with host galaxy redshifts. That is, we observe larger line-emitting regions\nat greater distances.\nThe above results are consistent with those of (e.g.)\nWillott et al. (1999, 2003); Privon et al. (2008) (and references therein), as well as many other past studies of emission line gas in radio galaxies. The tight redshift-luminosity\ncorrelation in flux-limited samples results in the selection\n\n15\n\nTABLE 3\nR ADIO P ROPERTIES\n\nSource\n(1)\n\nType\n(2)\n\nS178 MHz\n(Jy)\n(3)\n\nlog P178 MHz\n(erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 )\n(4)\n\n3C 33.0\n3C 40.0\n3C 78.0\n3C 93.1\n3C 129.0\n3C 132.0\n3C 136.1\n3C 180.0\n3C 196.1\n3C 197.1\n3C 219.0\n3C 227.0\n3C 234.0\n3C 270.0\n3C 285.0\n3C 314.1\n3C 319.0\n3C 388.0\n3C 390.3\n\nFR II\nFR II\nFR I\nCSS\nFR I\nFR II\nFR II\n***\nCSS\nFR II\nFR II\nFR II\nFR II\nFR I\nFR II\nFR I\nFR II\nFR II\nFR II\n\n49.0\n24.0\n15.0\n10.0\n21.0\n12.5\n13.0\n14.0\n14.5\n9.5\n44.0\n28.0\n29.0\n44.0\n10.5\n9.0\n17.0\n22.0\n44.0\n\n33.65\n32.20\n32.71\n34.51\n32.67\n34.26\n33.39\n34.33\n34.32\n33.55\n34.54\n33.74\n34.47\n32.75\n33.23\n33.59\n34.20\n33.69\n33.55\n\nR EFERENCES. - Fanaroff & Riley 1974; Spinrad et al.\n1985\nN OTE. - (1) Source name; (2) Fanaroff-Riley classification; (3) 178 MHz flux density in Jy; (4) Log10 of radio\npower at 178 MHz, in erg s\u22121 .\n\nof intrinsically brighter objects at higher redshifts. In radio flux density selected samples such as the 3CR, this is\nmanifest in more powerful radio galaxies (FR IIs) inhabiting a higher redshift range than do their intrinsically lowerpower counterparts (FR Is). Moreover, the alignment effect discussed in \u00a71 suggests that propagation of the radio\njet plays a role in the excitation of the ISM into line emission (Baum & Heckman 1989a; McCarthy 1993; Best et al.\n2000). It is therefore unsurprising that more powerful radio galaxies appear associated with higher emission line luminosities, as they are able to collisionally excite and photoionize greater amounts of gas than are lower-power (and\ntherefore lower-redshift) AGN (Baum & Heckman 1989a,b;\nRawlings & Saunders 1991; Inskip et al. 2002a,b). As accretion disk radiative luminosity appears related to the jet kinetic\nenergy flux (Baum & Heckman 1989b; Rawlings & Saunders\n1991), this can be used to place constraints on the physics of\nthe AGN. The greater mechanical energy input and number\nof ionizing photons provided by more powerful radio sources\nalso explains the dependence of emission line region size on\nredshift: we expect the more powerful radio galaxies at higher\nredshifts to be capable of exciting gas at greater distances\nfrom the central engine, resulting in the observed trend.\nIt should also be noted that dense clouds of gas are observed on increasingly larger scales at higher redshifts, ultimately forming the vast Ly-\u03b1 halos that surround the most\npowerful radio galaxies (van Ojik et al. 1997; Reuland et al.\n2003). While this dependence of gas cloud density and extent\non redshift is important for objects with z > 0.6 (the point\nnear which the alignment effect precipitously tightens), it is\nnot likely to contribute in any meaningful way to our comparatively low redshift sample at z < 0.3.\n5.

Radio luminosities are from Spinrad et al. (1985). Red\nsquares represent the four FR Is in our sample, while blue circles are FR IIs and green triangles represent those objects exhibiting a CSS or unclassified radio\nmorphology. We note the clear upward trend in both figures, consistent with the results of the comprehensive study by Willott et al. (1999) which found a tight\ncorrelation between emission line and radio luminosity in flux limited samples of radio galaxies. See Table 3 for a summary of the radio properties in our sample.\n\nF IG . 12.- Comparison of the projected linear sizes of the extended high surface brightness H\u03b1+[N II ] emission line regions with both (a) redshift and (b)\neffective radii Reff of the host galaxies. The size estimates represent the largest angular size (L.A.S) of the narrow line regions detected in our H\u03b1+[N II ] imaging.\nWe do not plot the L.A.S. of the [O III ] regions as their sizes generally mirror those of the H\u03b1+[N II ] regions, with some important exceptions (see \u00a74.2).\nCharacteristic error bars appear in the upper right corner of each plot. The effective radii, in kpc, are from Floyd et al. (2008) and Donzelli et al. (2007) and\nwere derived from surface brightness profile fitting to HST/NICMOS H-band images (and some NIR imaging from Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in the case of\nDonzelli et al. 2007). While the methods employed by these two studies differ, their results are generally consistent, and any uncertainty introduced in plotting\nresults from both papers is reflected in the characteristic error bar we have indicated. We have omitted 3C 40, 3C 78, and 3C 136.1 from (b) as no estimate for\ntheir Reff was available. Note the general upward trend of the L.A.S. with redshift, as well as a weaker upward trend with Reff . The former result is consistent with\nthe emission line study of Privon et al. (2008), and is expected given the tight redshift-luminosity correlation resulting in the selection of higher power sources at\nhigher redshifts. The higher-power sources are likely able to ionize gas at greater distances from the central engine, contributing to the upward trend we observe.\n\ncatalog. We have chosen the 3CR as the basis for our sample\nas it is radio flux density selected at a frequency dominated by\nunbeamed radio lobes, and is therefore free from orientation\nbias with respect to all HST wavelengths. Moreover, the 3CR\nhas been extensively covered by past ground- and space-based\nimaging and spectroscopy programs, yielding a robust, crossspectrum database containing galaxies exhibiting a wide variety of intrinsic characteristics. We limit our sample to the\nlow-redshift subset (z < 0.3) of the 3CR to maximize spatial\nresolution, as well as to ensure that the emission lines fall\n\nwithin the redshift range of high sensitivity. The ACS observations were carried out during HST Cycle 15, and in total,\n19 galaxies were observed prior to failure of the instrument in\nJanuary 2007. Reduction of these data was performed independently of the automated OTFR pipeline so as to improve\non flat-fielding and to more proactively clean the images of\ncosmic rays and hot pixels. In addition, contribution from\ncontinuum was subtracted to yield effectively pure emission\nline images.\nWe have compared the resulting emission line luminosities\n\n\fHST EMISSION LINE IMAGING OF RADIO GALAXIES\nwith both redshift and total radio power, finding weak positive\ncorrelations for each. We have also noted an upward trend between the projected size of the emission line gas distributions\nand redshift. These results are consistent with those from past\nstudies, and we have interpreted the apparent trends to be a\nresult of higher power radio galaxies, preferentially found at\ngreater distances, which can shock and photoionize greater\namounts of the ISM further away from the nucleus, thus resulting in brighter and more extended emission-line regions.\nRegardless of the interpretation, recombination times\nfor warm gas (T \u223c 104 K) are of order 103 years\n(Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), while lifetimes of radio sources\nare of order 108 years. The process by which the gas is ionized should therefore be ongoing throughout the lifetime of\nthe source, implying a strong connection between AGN activity and observed emission line properties. The sensitive, high\nspatial resolution images presented in this paper may therefore enrich future works studying jets propagating through\nthe ISM, and their relationship with extended and compact\n\n17\n\nstar formation regions as well as X-ray coronal halos. Future\nemission line studies of larger samples of radio galaxies may\nalso deepen understanding of radio-loud unification schemes,\nas warm optical line emitting gas traces fundamental energy\ntransport processes coupled to feedback at the interface of the\nAGN and its surrounding medium.\n\nWe are indebted to the anonymous referee whose comments led to the improvement of this work.
