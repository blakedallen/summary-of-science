Introduction\nLet (M, J, \u03a9) be a 2n-dimensional compact K\u00e4hler manifold with associated complex\nstructure J and symplectic form \u03a9. Yau's theorem implies that any representative of the\nfirst Chern class of M can be written as the Ricci curvature of a unique K\u00e4hler metric\nwhose 2-form \u03a9\u0303 lies in the same cohomology class of \u03a9 [27]. This can be restated by\nsaying that for every volume form \u03c3 on M satisfying\nZ\nZ\n(1.1)\n\u03c3=\n\u03a9n ,\nM\n\nM\n\nthere exists a unique K\u00e4hler form \u03a9\u0303 such that [\u03a9\u0303] = [\u03a9] and\n(1.2)\n\n\u03a9\u0303n = \u03c3 .\n\nThe same problem can be posed in an 'almost-K\u00e4hler' context, when \u03a9 remains closed\nbut J is merely an almost-complex structure. The latter is still orthogonal relative to a\nRiemannian metric g for which \u03a9(X, Y ) = g(JX, Y ), and\n(1.3)\n\n\u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9 + d\u03b1\n\nis again assumed to be a positive-definite (1, 1)-form relative to J. In this set-up,\n(1.1), (1.2), (1.3) constitute the Calabi\u2013Yau problem. Donaldson proved in [5] that its\nsolution is unique in four dimensions (see Proposition 3.2), and we provide a dimensionally reduced version of this proof in Section 4. In the almost-K\u00e4hler and Hermitian\ncases, the Calabi-Yau problem has been further studied in extensive papers by Tosatti,\nWeinkove, Yau and others [22, 23].\nA sufficient condition for the existence of solutions to the Calabi\u2013Yau equation in terms\nof the Chern connection was given in [22], but this condition fails in the strictly almostK\u00e4hler case when a scalar curvature function is negative (Proposition 3.3). The simplest\nsuch case is that of a Kodaira surface. The latter is a discrete quotient of C2 and carries\na holomorphic symplectic form trivializing the canonical bundle [14]. It thereby becomes\na symplectic non-K\u00e4hler manifold that is realized as a principal T 2 -bundle over a 2-torus\nbase T 2 . (Throughout this paper, we use blackboard font for the base, to avoid confusion.)\nAs such, it is often called the Kodaira\u2013Thurston manifold [21], and is a valuable vehicle\nfor testing new phenomena in differential geometry [1, 8].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. FINO, Y.Y. LI, S. SALAMON, L. VEZZONI\n\nIn [24], Tosatti and Weinkove solved the Calabi\u2013Yau problem on the Kodaira\u2013Thurston\nmanifold M for every T 2 -invariant volume form \u03c3. The purpose of this paper is threefold:\n(i) To extend the analysis of [24] to emphasize invariance of the solution by the S 1 action\nthat rotates the symplectic forms \u03a92 , \u03a93 and associated almost-complex structures J2 , J3 .\n(ii) To generalize the theory so as to tackle other T 2 -bundles over T 2 and assigned volume\nforms from the base.\n(iii) To set up the problem with arbitrary invariant metrics, as a first step to tackling\nmore general initial data.\nWe accomplish (i) with the aid of Theorem 4.4, reducing the problem to a standard\nMonge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation on the base, which can then be solved by an established theorem\nof the second author [15]. This is based on the existence of a potential for the holomorphic\nsyplectic structure, which is not surprising given that the relevant fibration is analogous\nto a moment mapping. The approach makes the solutions (or at least, the method of\nsolution) more explicit, and this is our aim in the other cases.\nBy work of Ue [25], any orientable 2-torus bundle M over a 2-torus is a smooth quotient\n\u0393\\X covered by solvmanifold. In practice, there are just three candidates for X that we\nneed consider in (ii), namely Nil 3 \u00d7R, Nil 4 and Sol 3 \u00d7R, all diffeomorphic to R4 , in which\nNil 3 , Nil 4 are nilpotent Lie groups and Sol 3 is a particular solvable Lie group. It is well\nknown (and we shall demonstrate) that such quotients all admit symplectic structures.\nThe notion of invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure makes sense in this context, meaning\none induced from a left-invariant structure on X which is invariant by \u0393. As regards (iii),\nwe make most progress in the nilpotent case:\nTheorem 1.1. Let M = \u0393\\X with X = Nil 3 \u00d7 R or Nil 4 , and suppose that M admits an\ninvariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure (g, J, \u03a9), and a T 2 -fibration \u03c0 : M \u2192 T2 whose fibres\nare Lagrangian. Then for every normalized volume form \u03c3 = eF \u03a92 with F \u2208 C \u221e (T 2 ), the\ncorresponding Calabi\u2013Yau problem has a unique solution.\nThe Lagrangian condition may or may not apply in the 2-step case, but is automatic\nwhen M is modelled on Nil 4 . The latter case leads to a generalized Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re\nequation on the 2-torus base, for which we establish solutions in Section 6. The same\nequation is needed to establish Theorem 1.1 for a second fibration \u0393\\(Nil 3 \u00d7 R) \u2192 T 2 in\nwhich the Lagrangian condition is not automatic, and in Section 7, we exhibit this 2-step\nsituation as a limiting case of the 3-step one.\nCompact quotients of Sol3 \u00d7 R do not admit Lagrangian fibrations, and therefore Theorem 1.1 does not apply. On the other hand, if \u03a9 is a symplectic form on the total\nspace of any T 2 -fibration M 4 \u2192 T 2 for which the fibres are not Lagrangian, then we\ncan choose a compatible almost-complex structure J such that \u03c0 is J-holomorphic. An\nelementary argument (Proposition 3.1) shows that the Calabi\u2013Yau problem for (g, J, \u03a9)\nalso has a solution in this very special case. We extend this argument in Section 8 by\nconsidering a foliation of M = \u0393\\(Sol 3 \u00d7 R) by 2-dimensional leaves transverse to \u03c0 that\nare holomorphic relative to any invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure.\nAcknowledgments.

A brief classification of T 2 -bundles over T 2\nOrientable bundles with a 2-torus fibre T 2 over a 2-torus base T 2 were classified by\nSakamoto and Fukuhara in [18] and it was shown by Ue that all these manifolds are\ngeometric. By a geometric 4-manifold in the sense of Thurston one means a pair (X, G)\nwhere X is a complete, simply-connected Riemannian 4-manifold, G is a group of isometries acting transitively on X that contains a discrete subgroup \u0393 such that \u0393\\X has finite\nvolume. Since the stabilizer of G at a point in X is compact and so \u0393\\X is compact if\nand only if \u0393\\G is compact.\nTwo pairs (X, G) and (X \u2032 , G\u2032 ) define the same geometry if the actions of G and G\u2032 are\nrelated by a diffeomorphism f : X \u2192 X \u2032 . There are nineteen 4-dimensional geometries X\nwhich have been classified by Filipkiewicz [7]. In the paper we will only consider the ones\nwhich are orientable T 2 -bundles over T 2 and we will take G to be the identity component\nof the isometry group of X. The relevant pairs (X, G) are:\n(0) X = E 4 (Euclidean 4-space) and G = SO(4) \u22c9 R4 , the semidirect product of\ntranslations and rotations;\n(1) X = Nil 3 \u00d7 E 1 , where Nil 3 is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group of matrices\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 x z\n(2.1)\nHx,y,z = \uf8ed 0 1 y \uf8f8\n0 0 1\n\nunder multiplication. Here, G is spanned by Nil 3 acting on itself on the left, by\ntranslation in the E 1 -factor and by an additional isometric action of S 1 :\n\n(x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x cos \u03b8 + y sin \u03b8, \u2212x sin \u03b8 + y cos \u03b8, z + 21 sin \u03b8(y 2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 x2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 2xy sin \u03b8));\n(2) X = Nil 4 = R \u22c9 R3 is the group\n\uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n(2.2)\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n\nof real matrices\n\uf8f6\nt 21 t2 x\n1 t y \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 1 z \uf8f8\n0 0 1\n\nunder multiplication. Given that Nil 4 coincides with the identity component of\nits isometry group, G = X acts on itself on the left.\n\n3\n3\n1\n2\n(3) X\n\u0012 = Sol\u0013 \u00d7 E , where Sol = R \u22c9\u03c6 R is a solvable Lie group with \u03c6(t) =\n\net 0\n, and G = X acts by left multiplication:\n0 e\u2212t\n\n(x0 , y0 , z0 , t0 )(x, y, z, t) = (x0 + et0 x, y0 + e\u2212t0 y, z0 + z, t0 + t).\nBy a suitable choice of basis, we can specify the Lie algebras of the three non-abelian\ngoups as follows:\n(1)\n(2.3)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nNil 3 \u00d7 R \u2190\u2192\nNil 4\n\n(0, 0, 0, 12),\n\n\u2190\u2192 (0, 13, 0, 12),\n\nSol 3 \u00d7 R \u2190\u2192 (0, 0, 13, 41).\n\nThe digits on the right encode the exterior derivative relative to an invariant coframe\n(e1 , . . . , e4 ), and in any case we shall use the notation e12*** = e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 * * * for simple\n\n\f4\n\nA. FINO, Y.Y. LI, S. SALAMON, L. VEZZONI\n\ndifferential forms. For example, in case (2), we opt to define e1 = \u2212dt, e2 = dy \u2212 tdz,\ne3 = dz, and (see (5.2)) we obtain\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\ni = 1, 3,\n\uf8f2 0\ni\n13\ne ,\ni = 2,\n(2.4)\nde =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 e12 ,\ni = 4.\nIf one re-scales so that the middle line becomes de2 = \u03bbe13 , case (1) is the result of letting\n\u03bb tend to 0. This observation is important for the sequel.\nNote that Sol 3 refers to just one particular solvable Lie group, distinct for example\nfrom that with Lie group corresponding to (0, 13, 14) that has no cocompact lattice.\n\nThe diffeomorphism classes of (the total space of) T 2 -bundles over T 2 can be summarized in Geiges' eight families [9, Table 1]. By [9, Theorem 3], the total space is K\u00e4hler if\nand only the geometric type is E 4 ; this happens for two families, which are not interesting from our point of view. For each of the other six families we next describe X, \u0393, the\nmonodromy matrices A1 , A2 \u2208 SL(2, Z) along the curves \u03b31 , \u03b32 generating \u03c01 (T 2 ), as well\nas the Euler class (m, n) for the corresponding T 2 -bundle, which can be then described\nby the generators of \u0393. By [26] for some lifts \u03b3\u0303i to M we have\n\u03c01 (M) = \u03b3\u03031 , \u03b3\u03032 , l, h | [l, h] = 1, \u03b3\u0303i (l, h)\u03b3i\u22121 = (l, h)Ai , [\u03b3\u03031 , \u03b3\u03032] = lm hn .\nThe discrete group \u0393 arises as the image of a faithful representation \u03c1 from \u03c01 (M) to\nthe group of orientation-preserving isometries of X, so \u0393 is generated by \u03c1(\u03b3\u03031 ), \u03c1(\u03b3\u03032 ),\n\u03c1(l), \u03c1(h). To simplify the notation we identify a generating map with the image of\n(x, y, z, t) under this map. Unless otherwsie stated, there is no restriction on (m, n).\nFollowing [9] and [26], we have the six families:\n(1a ) X = Nil 3 \u00d7 E 1 , with \u0393 generated by\n(x + 1, y, z + \u03bby, t), (x, y + 1, z, t), (x, y, z + 1, t), (x, y, z, t + 1).\nHere A1 = A2 = I (the identity matrix), \u03bb 6= 0 and (m, n) 6= (0, 0).\n(1b ) X = Nil 3 \u00d7 E 1 , with \u0393 generated by\n(x, y, z + \u03b21 , t), (x + \u03b11 , y, z + \u03b11 y, t),\n(x + \u03b12 , y, z + \u03b12 y + \u03b22 , t + 1), (\u2212x, y + 1, \u2212z + \u03b33 , t).\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22121 \u03bb\nHere A1 =\n, A2 = I, with \u03b21 , \u03b11 , \u03bb all non-zero.\n0 \u22121\n(1c ) X = Nil 3 \u00d7 E 1 , with \u0393 generated by\n(x, y, z + \u03b21 , t), (x + \u03b11 , y, z + \u03b11 y, t),\n(x + \u03b13 , y + 1, z + \u03b13 y + \u03b24 , t), (\u2212x, y, \u2212z, t + 1).\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03bb\nHere A1 =\n, A2 = \u2212I, with \u03b21 , \u03b11 , \u03bb all non-zero.\n0 1\n(2) X = Nil 4 , with \u0393 generated by\n(x + \u03b11 , y, z, t), (x, y + \u03b21 , z, t),\n(x + y + 21 z + \u03b12 , y, z, t + 1), (x + \u03b13 y + \u03b23 , z + 1, t).\n\n\fTHE CALABI\u2013YAU EQUATION ON 4-MANIFOLDS OVER 2-TORI\n\nHere A1 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u03bb\n0 1\n\n\u0013\n\n, A2 = I, with \u03b21 = n1 , \u03bb =\n\n1\n,\nn\u03b11\n\n\u03b23 =\n\nm\n\u03b11\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n5\n\nand n 6= 0.\n\n(3a ) X = Sol 3 \u00d7 E 1 , with \u0393 generated by\n(x + \u03b11 , y + \u03b21 , z, t),\n(x + \u03b12 , y + \u03b22 , z, t),\n(x + \u03b13 , y + \u03b23 , z + 1, t), (\u01eb e\u03b4 x + \u03b14 , \u01eb e\u2212\u03b4 y + \u03b24 , z, t + \u03b4).\nHere A1 \u2208 SL(2, Z), A2 = I, and \u01eb = \u00b11.\n(3b ) X = Sol 3 \u00d7 E 1 , with \u0393 generated by\n(x + \u03b11 , y + \u03b21 , z, t),\n(x + \u03b12 , y + \u03b22 , z, t),\n(\u2212x + \u03b13 , \u2212y + \u03b23 , z + 1, t), (\u01eb e\u03b4 x + \u03b14 , \u01eb e\u2212\u03b4 y + \u03b24 , z, t + \u03b4), .\nHere A1 \u2208 SL(2, Z), A2 = \u2212I, and \u01eb = 1. As in (3a ), there are various relations\n(which we omit) between the other parameters.\nThe total space M of an orientable T 2 -bundle over T 2 is then a quotient \u0393\\X, where\nX\u223c\n= R4 is taken from the list above and \u0393 is a discrete subgroup which acts freely on X.\nAlthough \u0393 is not necessarily a subgroup of X, it always contains a subgroup \u03930 , which is\na lattice of X, such that \u03930 \\\u0393 is finite. As such, \u0393\\X is covered by the solvmanifold \u03930 \\X.\nWhen \u0393 = \u03930 the quotient \u0393\\X is a solvmanifold (resp. nilmanifold if X is nilpotent),\notherwise \u0393\\X is called an infra-solvmanifold (resp. infra-nilmanifold ). In the list above,\nin the cases (1a ) and (2), the group \u0393 is always a lattice, while in the case (3a ) \u0393 is a\nlattice if and only if its last generator has \u01eb = 1.

FINO, Y.Y. LI, S. SALAMON, L. VEZZONI\n\n3. almost-K\u00e4hler structures\nSince our main focus of attention is real symplectic geometry, we first discuss the\nexistence of invariant closed non-degenerate 2-forms compatible with each of the fibrations\nlisted in (2.3). Any such 2-form can always be expressed as f 13 +f 42 relative to some basis\ni\n(f i ) related by a constant linear transformation to a basis (e\nby (2.3). It follows\nP) defined\nthat we can choose a Riemannian metric g (for example\nf i \u2297 f i ) and an orthogonal\nalmost-complex structure J (for example,\nJ = f 1 \u2297 f3 \u2212 f 3 \u2297 f1 \u2212 f 2 \u2297 f4 + f 4 \u2297 f2 ),\nsuch that\n\u03a9(X, Y ) = g(JX, Y ).\nThe resulting triple (g, J, \u03a9) constitutes an invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure on M.\nReturning to (2.3), we first remark that M has a complex structure if and only if\nb1 (M) = 3, which is precisely case (1a ) of the previous section [9]. We shall denote the\ntwo inequivalent projections from the first row of (2.5) by\n(3.1)\n\n:\n\nM \u2192 T 2xy ,\n\n\u03c0yt :\n\nM \u2192 T 2yt .\n\n\u03c0xy\n\nThe usual projection \u03c0xy defining the Kodaira\u2013Thurston manifold M is holomorphic with\nrespect to an invariant complex structure J1 . There is also a holomorphic symplectic\n2-form \u0398 = \u03a92 + i\u03a93 for which \u03c0xy is bilagrangian, meaning that both \u03a92 and \u03a93 restrict\nto zero on the fibres. This is equivalent to the single complex equation \u0398 \u2227 e12 = 0. With\nthe labelling below, the canonical choice is \u03a92 = e13 + e42 and \u03a93 = e14 + e23 (see (4.1) and\n(4.2)), though one aspect of Section 4 is to explain that there are families of equivalent\nsuch structures.\nWith the above convention, \u03a92 \u2227 e13 6= 0, so \u03a92 is non-degenerate on the fibres of \u03c0yt .\nIndeed, \u03a92 is compatible with the almost-complex structure characterized by\nJe1 = e3 ,\n\nJe4 = e2 ,\n\nfor which \u03c0yt is holomorphic. By this we mean that J induces a complex structure J on\nT = T 2yt and the differential\n(3.2)\n\n\u03c0\u2217 : (Tm M, J) \u2192 (T, J)\n\nis complex linear (J is necessarily integrable for dimensional reasons). This situation, in\nwhich the projection respects the almost-K\u00e4hler structure, contrasts with that for \u03c0xy .\nOn the other hand, the fibres of \u03c0yt remain Lagrangian for \u03a93 . We shall study (M, \u03a93 )\nas a limiting case of the Nil 4 model, in which e13 is again the volume form on the base\nand \u03a93 is a symplectic form for which the fibres are necessarily Lagrangian.\nIn the cases different from (1a ), the fibration of M as a torus bundle is unique [9,\nTheorem 1]. In (3a ) and (3b ), the symplectic form e12 + e34 is non-zero (and so nondegenerate) on the fibres of \u03c0zt . Note that e34 is closed by (2.3)(3), in which the distinction\nbetween e41 and e14 is important. The following general result is relevant to this situation.\nProposition 3.1. Let \u03a9 be an invariant symplectic form on M = \u0393\\X, and suppose that\n\u03a9 is non-zero on the fibres of a T 2 -fibration \u03c0 : M \u2192 T 2 . Then there exists an invariant\nalmost-K\u00e4hler structure (g, J, \u03a9) on M for which \u03c0 is J-holomorphic. In this situation, if\n\u03c3 = eF \u03a92 is a volume form satisfying (1.1) with F \u2208 C \u221e (T 2 ), the associated Calabi\u2013Yau\nproblem has a solution.\n\n\fTHE CALABI\u2013YAU EQUATION ON 4-MANIFOLDS OVER 2-TORI\n\n7\n\nProof. Let f 12 be a volume form on the base T 2 , and fix a point m \u2208 M. By assumption,\nf 12 \u2227 \u03a9 6= 0 and we can choose \u03bc \u2208 R such that\n0 = (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03bcf 12 )2 = \u03a92 \u2212 2\u03bcf 12 \u2227 \u03a9\nat m. This means that \u03a9 \u2212 \u03bcf 12 is a simple 2-form, and so there exists a basis (f i ) of\n1-forms such that\n\u03a9 = \u03bcf 12 + f 34 .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe required almost-K\u00e4hler structure is obtained by defining J to be the almost-complex\nstructure J whose value at m is given by Jf1 = \u03bcf2 and Jf3 = f4 in the dual basis. As\nabove, J induces a complex structure J on T 2 , and (3.2) is complex linear.\nAs m varies along the fibre, the parameter \u03bc remains constant by invariance. To solve\nthe Calabi\u2013Yau problem, we merely set\n\u03a9\u0303 = eF \u03bcf 12 + f 34 ,\nwhich yields (1.2) immediately. Observe that \u03a9\u0303 \u2212 \u03a9 is the pullback of the (1, 1)-form\n(eF \u2212 1)\u03bcf 12 on T = T 2 .

We shall tag this uniqueness statement to\nall our own existence results without further comment (except for Remark 4.6).\nProposition 3.2. Any solution of the Calabi\u2013Yau problem (1.1), (1.2), (1.3) on a compact\n4-manifold is unique.\nb With\nProof. Given two solutions \u03a9\u0303, \u03a9\u0303\u2032 of the problem, set \u03a9\u0303 \u2212 \u03a9\u0303\u2032 = d\u03b1 and \u03a9\u0303 + \u03a9\u0303\u2032 = \u03a9.\nb are of type (1, 1) and the latter defines a (positive-definite)\nrespect to J, both d\u03b1 and \u03a9\nb\nRiemannian metric gb by the usual formula \u03a9(X,\nY ) = gb(JX, Y ).

A standard Stokes' argument then tells us that d\u03b1 = 0.\n\u0003\n3.1. The condition R > 0. Tosatti, Weinkove and Yau defined a certain tensor R using\nthe canonical connection and Nijenhuis tensor of J [22]. They proved that if R is positive,\nthen the Calabi\u2013Yau equation has a solution.\nOn any almost-K\u00e4hler manifold (M, J, \u03a9) there exists a unique connection \u2207 such\nthat \u2207J = 0, \u2207\u03a9 = 0 and whose has no (1, 1)-component. This is the so-called canonical\nconnection or Chern connection (though the latter is sometimes reserved for the Hermitian\ncase). We denote its curvature tensor by R, and set\nj\ni\n+ 4Nljr Nrk\n,\nRijkl (g, J) = Rikl\n\nwhere N is the Nijenhuis tensor of J. According to [22], the condition\n(3.5)\n\nR(g, J) > 0,\n\n\f8\n\nA. FINO, Y.Y. LI, S. SALAMON, L.

To see this, we first\nprove\nProposition 3.3. Let (M, J, \u03a9) be a 4-dimensional almost-K\u00e4hler manifold and let s =\ng rk g sl Rrksl be the scalar curvature of \u2207. Assume s 6 0.

On a 4-dimensional infra-solvmanifold M = \u0393\\G with an invariant\nalmost-K\u00e4hler structure condition (3.5) is satisfied only in the K\u00e4hler case.\nProof. We first prove the statement in the solvable case when \u0393 is a lattice of G. If J is\nan invariant almost-complex structure, then its first Chern class vanishes. This implies\nthat the Ricci form \u03c1 associated to any J-compatible metric g is exact. If g is invariant,\nthen also \u03c1 is left-invariant and the scalar curvature s = trg \u03c1 is constant. Therefore if g\nis an invariant J compatible almost-K\u00e4hler metric with associated symplectic form \u03c9 we\nhave\nZ\nZ\n0=\n\u03c1 \u2227\u03c9 = cs\n\u03c92\nM\n\nM\n\nc being a non-zero constant. Hence s vanishes and the claim follows.\nOn the other hand, if M is an infra-solvmanifold with an invariant almost-K\u00e4hler\nstructure, then it is covered by an almost-K\u00e4hler solvmanifold. Since the tensor R depends\nonly from the almost-K\u00e4hler structure, then condition (3.5) is invariant for covering which\npreserve the almost-K\u00e4hler structure and the claim follows.\n\u0003\n4. Manifolds modelled on Nil 3 \u00d7 R\nIn this section, we consider in more detail the Kodaira\u2013Thurston manifold M = \u03930 \\X,\na discrete quotient of X = Nil 3 \u00d7 R. The standard choice of \u03930 (case (1a ) of Section 2\nwith \u03bb = 1) allows us to consider the two principal T 2 -fibrations (3.1) with 2-torus base.\nThe manifold M has a global basis consisting of real 1-forms\n(4.1)\n\ne1 = dy,\n\ne2 = dx,\n\ne3 = dt,\n\ne4 = dz \u2212 xdy.\n\nThis basis conforms to the first structure equation in (2.3), although the 1-dimensional\nfactor in Nil 3 \u00d7 R is in third place. Any tensor that can be expressed in terms of it\n\n\fTHE CALABI\u2013YAU EQUATION ON 4-MANIFOLDS OVER 2-TORI\n\n9\n\nwith constant coefficients is called invariant to reflect the fact that it is induced from a\nleft-invariant tensor on the Lie group X. In particular, M inherits a complex structure\nand holomorphic symplectic form\n(4.2)\n\n(e1 + ie2 ) \u2227 (e3 + ie4 ) = d\u03b61 \u2227 d\u03b62 ,\n\nwhere\n\u03b61 = y + ix,\n\u03b62 = t \u2212 21 x2 + iz\nare local complex coordinates on the base and fibres. The latter become bilagrangian,\nand \u03c0xy is holomorphic. This observation is readily generalized.\nWe first describe the space of invariant symplectic forms on M. An element of this\nspace lies in\nker d = he12 , e13 , e14 , e23 , e24 i ,\nand so equals\n\u03a9\u03bb,A = \u03bbe12 + e1 \u2227 (ae3 + be4 ) \u2212 e2 \u2227 (ce3 + de4 ),\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 R and some real 2 \u00d7 2 matrix A =\n\n\u0012\n\na b\nc d\n\n\u0013\n\nwith det A 6= 0. With this\n\nconvention, (4.2) equals \u03a90,I + i \u03a90,J where I is the identity matrix and J =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0 1\n.\n\u22121 0\n\nLemma 4.1. The fibration \u03c0xy is Lagrangian with respect to any invariant symplectic\nform on M.\nProof. The simple 2-form e12 represents a non-zero volume form on the base of \u03c0xy . At\nthe level of differential forms, the restriction of \u03a9\u03bb,A to any fibre is therefore determined\nby the wedge product \u03a9\u03bb,A \u2227 e12 = 0. The result follows.\n\u0003\nMore generally, consider two such forms \u03a92 , \u03a93 with \u03a9i = \u03a9\u03bbi ,Ai . It is not difficult to\narrange for \u0398 = \u03a92 + i \u03a93 to satisfy \u0398 \u2227 \u0398 = 0; this is equivalent to asserting\n(4.3)\n\ndet(B) = 1,\n\ntr(B) = 0,\n\nB = A\u22121\n2 A3 .\n\nWhen conditions (4.3) hold, we can write \u0398 = \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 over C, whence \u039b1,0 = h\u03b11 , \u03b12 i is\nthe space of (1, 0)-forms relative to some invariant complex structure J1 on M. Observe\nthat\n0 = d\u0398 = d\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2227 d\u03b12 ,\nwhich proves that (d\u03b1i )0,2 = 0 for i = 1, 2. The integrability of J1 then follows from the\nNewlander\u2013Nirenberg theorem.\nSince \u0398 \u2227 e12 = 0, the real 2-form e12 has type (1, 0) relative to J1 . It follows that we\ncan choose p, q \u2208 C so that \u03b11 = pe1 + qe2 , defining a complex structure on the base T xy\nrelative to which \u03c0xy is holomorphic. The fibres of \u03c0xy themselves become holomorphic\ncurves in (M, J1 ). We complete these observations with\nProposition 4.2. Given an invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure (g, J2 , \u03a92 ) on M, we can\nchoose a holomorphic symplectic structure \u0398 = \u03a92 + i \u03a93 and associated complex structure\nJ1 for which \u03c0xy is holomorphic. Conversely, any invariant complex structure on M arises\nin this way.\nProof. By assumption, g is a scalar product for which\ng(J2X, J2 Y ) = g(X, Y ),\n\ng(J2X, Y ) = \u03a92 (X, Y ).\n\nOrient M by means of J2 , so that the 3-dimensional space \u039b+ of self-dual 2-forms relative\nto g contains the closed 2-form \u03a92 . Since ker d has dimension 5 on the space of 2-forms,\n\n\f10\n\nA. FINO, Y.Y. LI, S. SALAMON, L. VEZZONI\n\nwe can find a non-zero closed 2-form \u03a93 in the orthogonal complement of \u03a92 in \u039b+ . The\northogonality means that \u03a92 \u2227 \u03a93 = 0 and we can normalize \u03a93 so that \u03a92 \u2227 \u03a92 = \u03a93 \u2227 \u03a93 .\nIt follows that \u0398 = \u03a92 + i \u03a93 satisfies \u0398 \u2227 \u0398 = 0 as in (4.3), and \u03c0xy is holomorphic.\nConversely, suppose that J is an arbitrary invariant complex structure. Since J is\nintegrable, its space \u039b1,0 of (1, 0)-forms is generated by invariant 1-forms \u03b11 , \u03b12 for which\nd\u03b11 = 0 and d\u03b12 is divisible by \u03b11 , by [19, Theorem 1.3]. It follows that the invariant\n2-form \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 \u2208 \u039b2,0 is closed and, after fixing a compatible metric, we have recovered\nthe initial hypothesis.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3. The discussion above shows that M possesses a non-trivial moduli space\nof holomorphic symplectic structures \u0398. Specifying the invariant complex structure J1\nis equivalent to specifying the projective class h\u0398i, and J1 in turn determines a complex\nstructure on both the base T 2xy and a fibre T 2 that become elliptic curves. Taken together,\nthese two complex structures can be specified by a pair of invariants (j1 , j2 ) \u2208 C2 . A third\nparameter is required to 'scale' base and fibre, but can be eliminated by quotienting by\nthe action of right translation by Nil 3 commuting with \u0393, cf. [12, 17].\nGiven an invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure, extended as in the proposition, it is possible\nto set \u0398 = \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 , where\n\u03b11 = f 1 + if 2 \u2208 he1 , e2 iC ,\n\n\u03b12 = f 3 + if 4 ,\n\nthe f i have equal norms relative to g, and df i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. (To achieve the latter,\nmultiply \u03b12 by a unit complex number so that f 3 is a linear combination of e1 , e2 , e3 .)\nWe can now write df 4 = kf 12 with k 6= 0. Apart from this last factor, we have recovered\nthe structure equation (2.3)(1). In particular, any two invariant holomorphic symplectic\nstructures are equivalent by a Lie algebra automorphism.\nWith the assumptions of the last paragraph, the space \u039b+ of self-dual 2-forms (see\n(3.4)) is generated by\n(4.4)\n\n\u03a91 = f 12 + f 34 ,\n\n\u03a92 = f 13 + f 42 ,\n\n\u03a93 = f 14 + f 23 .\n\nThe space \u039b+Pdetermines the conformal (or rather, in an invariant context, the homothety)\nclass of g =\nf i \u2297 f i . Its annihilator \u039b\u2212 = h\u03a91 , \u03a92 , \u03a93 i\u25e6 (relative to wedge product) is\nthe space of anti-self-dual 2-forms.\nWe shall in fact fix the homothety class of g by requiring that\n(4.5)\n\n\u0398 = (f 1 + if 2 ) \u2227 (f 3 + if 4 ) = \u03a92 + i \u03a93\n\nhave the same norm as (4.2).

For simplicity, we first suppose that f 1 = e1 = dx and f 2 = e2 = dy, which is the\ncase when \u0398 has the standard form (4.2).

This equation can be re-written\ndPx \u2227 dPy = eF f 12 .\nR\nR\nOn the other hand, substituting (4.9), T dPx \u2227 dPy = T f 12 , since p and its derivatives\nintegrate to zero. Thus, (4.7) is a necessary condition for a solution to (4.10).\nWe define\n\n(4.10)\n\n(4.11)\n\ne = (dPx + i dPy ) \u2227 (f 3 + if 4 ),\n\u0398\n\nin analogy to (4.5).

We also have\nRecalling that \u03a91 = f 12 + f 34 , it is equally obvious that \u0398\ne \u2227 \u0398 = 0, and, with a bit more work,\n\u0398\ne \u2227 \u0398 = 2(Pxx + Pyy ).\n\u0398\n\nThe second bullet point follows by setting h = 12 (Pxx + Pyy ).\nFinally, we may write\n(4.12)\n\ne \u2212 \u0398 = (dpx + idpy ) \u2227 (f 3 + if 4 )\n\u0398\n\n= d [(px + ipy ) \u2227 (f 3 + if 4 )] \u2212 (px + ipy ) \u2227 ikf 12\n= d\u03b1,\n\nwhere\n\u03b1 = \u2212kp(f 1 + if 2 ) + (px + ipy )(f 3 + if 4 )\nis a well-defined 1-form on T.

The uniqueness statement for solutions of Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re on the 2-torus\nbase will translate into a uniqueness result for the 4-dimensional problem. The only\ngap in our presentation is the proof that the problem on M necessarily gives rise to a\nsolution of (4.8). However, uniqueness is already covered by Proposition 3.2, whose proof\ntranslates directly into the following neat argument for (4.8).\nTaking\n2h = Puu + Pvv = 4 + \u2206p,\nto be positive, the triple (Puu , Pvv , Puv ) defines (at each point of T) a vector inside the\nforward light cone in R1,2 with a Lorentzian norm equal to eF .

This is because any symplectic form \u03a9\nbelongs to\nker d = he12 , e13 , e14 , e23 i .\nThis time it is e13 = dz \u2227 dt that represents a volume form on the base, and\n\u03a9 \u2227 e13 = 0.\n\n(5.3)\n\nOf course, it remains true that \u03a9 \u2227 e12 = 0.\nThe canonical choice for a positively-oriented symplectic form is e14 + e23 , and the next\nresult shows that the general case is not so very different.

The inherent filtration would be more memorable had we interchanged e2 \u2194 e3 , but\nthis would have caused bigger notational difficulties elsewhere.\nProof. We can certainly find an orthonormal basis (f i ) of 1-forms for which (5.5) is valid,\nwhilst retaining the freedom to act by the stabilizer U(2). Using the latter, we firstly\nensure that f 1 = ke1 for some k 6= 0, leaving freedom to rotate in the f 23 plane. Any\n2-form in the image of d is divisible by e1 , so d(f 14 ) = \u2212f 1 \u2227 df 4 = 0.\nSince (5.3) holds in all cases, f 23 \u2227 e13 = 0. This means that we can choose f 2 to be a\nlinear combination of e1 , e3 . We now have\n0 = d(f 23 ) = \u2212f 2 \u2227 df 3 = e13 \u2227 \u03c3,\nfor some 1-form \u03c3 \u2208 he2 , \u03bbe3 i.

Let a, b, c, (lij ), (mij ) and F be as above. Then (6.3) and (6.4) have a\nsolution p \u2208 C 2 (T) if and only if\nZ\n(6.5)\n(eF \u2212 ab + c2 ) = 0.\nT\n\nMoreover, p is unique modulo addition of a constant, and any C 2 solution is in C \u221e .\nProof. We first prove that (6.5) is a necessary condition for (6.3) to have a solution. Using\nthe periodicity of p, we see that the following functions integrate to zero over the 2-torus:\npx ,\n\npy ,\n\npxx px = 12 \u2202x (p2x ),\n\npxx ,\n\npxy ,\n\npyy ,\n\npxy px = 21 \u2202y (p2x ),\n\npyy py ,\n\npxy py .\n\nIntegrating by parts to obtain the last function, we also have\nZ\nZ\nZ\npyy px = \u2212 py pxy = 0,\npxx py = 0.\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\n2\n\nIf (6.3) has a solution p \u2208 C (T) then, from above and assumptions on (lij ), (mij ),\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\nF\ne =\n(a + pxx )(b + pyy ) \u2212 (c + pxy )2\nT\nT\n\u0003\n+(l11 px + m11 py )(l22 px + m22 py ) \u2212 (l12 px + m12 py )2\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n= (ab \u2212 c )|T| +\npyy pxx \u2212 p2xy\nZ h\nT\ni\n2\n2\n+\npx (l11 l22 \u2212 l12\n) + p2y (m11 m22 \u2212 m212 ) + px py (l11 m22 + l22 m11 \u2212 2l12 m12 )\nT\n\n2\n\n= (ab \u2212 c )|T| +\n\nZ\n\nT\n\nSimilarly,\n(6.6)\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\npyy pxx \u2212 p2xy .\n\npyy pxx \u2212\n\np2xy\n\n\u0003\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u2212py pxxy \u2212 p2xy = 0.\n\nIt follows that (6.5) holds.\nNow we prove the uniqueness of solutions modulo addition of constants. Let p and pe\nbe two solutions of (6.3) and (6.4). Let h be a constant such that\n\u0002\n\u0003\nmin (p + h) \u2212 pe = 0.\nT\n\nClearly p + h is also a solution of (6.3) and (6.4).

Thus, by the strong maximum principle, (p+h)\u2212 pe \u2261 0.

Representation theory. The fibrations \u03c0xy , \u03c0zt of the Kodaira\u2013Thurston manifold\nare intimately related to its function theory and unitary representations of the Heisenberg\ngroup Nil 3 . We describe this briefly.\nFor simplicity, ignore the R factor and work on the nilmanifold M 3 = Z3 \\Nil 3 , where\nZ3 is the standard integer lattice (see (2.1)). Consider the action of Nil 3 on f \u2208 L2 (R)\ndefined by setting\n(Hx,y,z * f )(u) = e2\u03c0ik(z+yu) f (x + u),\nwhere Hx,y,z is the matrix (2.1) and (here) k is an integer. This makes L2 (R) into a\nunitary representation of Nil 3 that we denote by Vk .\nFollowing the discussion on [13, page 6], for any smooth function f \u2208 L2 (R), we set\nX\nX\n(7.1)\nF (x, y, z) =\n(Hx,y,z * f )(n) = e2\u03c0ikz\nf (x + n)e2\u03c0inky .\nn\u2208Z\n\nn\u2208Z\n\nBy its construction, F = Ff is a well-defined function M 3 \u2192 C. Indeed\nF (x + a, y + b, z + c + ay) = F (x, y, z),\n\na, b, c \u2208 Z,\n\nusing the coordinates of (2.1). In particular, one may regard x, y as defined on T 2xy and\ny as defined on T 2yt , but we are now considering functions outside the T 2 invariant class\n2\nthat we have previously considered. If we take f (x) = e\u2212\u03c0x then\nF (x, y, z) = e2\u03c0ikz \u03b8(ky + ix)f (x)\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a classical theta function.\nThe mapping f 7\u2192 F given by (7.1) realizes Vk as a summand of L2 (M 3 ). A more\nsubtle discussion leads to a Peter\u2013Weyl type decomposition\nM\n|k|Vk ,\n(7.3)\nL2 (M 3 ) \u223c\n= L2 (T 2 ) \u2295\nk\u2208Z\n\nin which Vk occurs as an isotypic component of multiplicity |k| (see [3] and references\ntherein). In our context, one might first hope to extend the class of assigned volume\nforms to functions on M 3 , and analyse their behaviour under the relevant differentuial\noperators with the aid of (7.3). Generalizations of the latter hold for L2 spaces of sections\nof holomorphic line bundles over the Kodaira\u2013Thurston manifold [6, 13].\n8. Almost-K\u00e4hler structures for Sol 3 \u00d7 R\nIn this final section, we make some observations regarding Calabi\u2013Yau problems for the\nmanifolds belonging to the families (3a ) and (3b ).\nAs in Section 7, we assume that M is a solvmaniolfd (i.e. that \u0393 is a lattice) and then\nwe use the observation of Subsection 7.1 to generalize to the case of infra-solvmanifolds.\nLet\n\u03c0 : M = \u0393\\R4 \u2212\u2192 T 2zt\nbe the relevant T 2 -bundle with \u03c0(x, y, z, t) = (z, t) and \u0393 a lattice of G. In the notation\nof Section 2, we begin with the coframe\n(8.1)\n\ne1 = dt,\n\ne2 = dz,\n\ne3 = et dx,\n\ne4 = e\u2212t dy.\n\u25e6\n\nEach tangent space to the fibres of \u03c0zt is represented by the annihilator he1 , e2 i , and e12\nis a volume form on the base T 2zt .\n\n\f22\n\nA. FINO, Y.Y. LI, S. SALAMON, L. VEZZONI\n\nA special feature of the geometry modelled on (8.1) is that the transversal subspace\n\u25e6\nhe , e4 i is tangent to a distribution D that is also integrable. This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the invariant forms e3 , e4 generate a differential ideal. Moreover,\n3\n\nLemma 8.1. Let (g, J, \u03a9) be any invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure on M. The distribution D is J-holomorphic, and there exists an orthonormal basis (f i ) such that\n\u03a9 = f 12 + f 34 ,\n\n(8.2)\nand\nf 1 \u2208 he1 i,\n\nf 3 \u2208 he3 i,\n\nf 4 \u2208 he3 , e4 i.\n\nProof. Let (f i ) be an orthonormal basis of 1-forms for which (8.2) is valid and f 1 \u2208 he1 i.\nSince any 2-form in the image of d is divisible by e1 , we get d(f 12 ) = \u2212f 1 \u2227 df 2 = 0. Thus,\n0 = d(f 34 ) = \u2212f 3 \u2227 df 4 + df 3 \u2227 f 4 = e1 \u2227 (f 3 \u2227 \u03c3 + f 4 \u2227 \u03c4 ),\nfor some 1-forms \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 he3 , e4 i \u2229 hf 3 , f 4 i. If \u03c3 \u2227 \u03c4 = 0, then hf 3 , f 4 i contains a closed\n1-form that cannot be proportional to e1 . Then then d(f 34 ) 6= 0. Therefore \u03c3, \u03c4 are\nlinearly independent and hf 3 , f 4i = he3 , e4 i. Finally, we may rotate in this plane so as to\nselect f 3 \u2208 he3 i.\nIt now follows that f 4 = Jf 3 and so D is J-invariant.\n\u0003\nIf f 2 \u2208 he1 , e2 i then \u03c0zt is also J-holomorphic, and we can apply Proposition 3.1 to\nobtain an elementary solution:\nCorollary 8.2. Let (g, J, \u03a9) be an invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure on M for which \u03c0zt\nis J-holomorphic, and let \u03c3 = eF \u03a9 be a normalized volume form with eF \u2208 C \u221e (T 2zt ).\nThen the Calabi\u2013Yau equation (\u03a9 + d\u03b1)2 = \u03c3 has a unique solution.\nOne can apply the same argument for a volume form that is constant along the leaves\nof the associated foliation:\nCorollary 8.3. Let (g, J, \u03a9) be an invariant almost-K\u00e4hler structure on M and let \u03c3 =\neF \u03a9 be a normalized volume form such that dF \u2227 e34 = 0. Then the Calabi\u2013Yau equation\n(\u03a9 + d\u03b1)2 = \u03c3 has a unique solution.\nProof. Let (f i ) a coframe of 1-forms as in Lemma 8.1. A solution of the Calabi\u2013Yau\nequation is simply given by \u03a9\u0303 = f 12 + eF f 34 . Indeed, \u03a9\u0303 is compatible with respect to J\nsince J preserves f 34 , and \u03a9\u0303 \u2212 \u03a9 = (eF \u2212 1)f 34 is exact since the normalization\nZ\n(eF \u2212 1)f 1234 = 0\nM\n\nimplies that it has zero cup product with H 2 (M, R) = h[f 12 ], [f 34 ]i = h[e12 ], [e34 ]i.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is interesting to compare the dual situations highlighted by the last two results. In\nCorollary 8.2, the choice of \u03a9 (or, alternatively, J) is restricted but F is a free function\non the base. On the other hand, Corollary 8.3 refers to an arbitrary invariant almostK\u00e4hler structure, though \u03a9 and J are in practice already constrained by the geometry.\nBecause of the anture of the foliation one is dealing with, the applicable class of functions\nis restricted, as our final example illustrates.\nExample 8.4. This is a sequel to Example 2.1 in which M = M 3 \u00d7 S 1 , with z a coordinate\non S 1 . The leaves of D have the form C \u00d7 S 1 , where C is an integral curve of the form\n(x, y, t) = (x0 /\u03c3 k , y0 \u03c3 k , t),\n\nk\u03b4 6 t < (k + 1)\u03b4.\n\n\fTHE CALABI\u2013YAU EQUATION ON 4-MANIFOLDS OVER 2-TORI\n\n23\n\nFor generic (x0 , y0 ) this curve is dense in M 3 and so any smooth function constant on C\nis constant on M 3 . Therefore\nthe hypothesis dF \u2227 e34 = 0 implies that F \u2208 C \u221e (S 1 ), and\nR\nthe normalization is S 1 F (z) dz = 0.\n\n8.1. Conclusion. Earlier in the paper, we successfully solved the Calabi\u2013Yau problem\nfor volume forms invariant by a 2-torus action, relative to various fixed almost-K\u00e4hler\nstructures and Lagrangian fibrations to a 2-torus base T 2 . The T 2 -invariance is a natural\nhypothesis, in view of the analogy with toric geometry in which moment mappings play\nthe role of the fibrations.\nOn the other hand, the examples in the present section show that, in a more general\ncontext, it is futile to restrict the class of volume forms. The manifold \u0393\\Sol 3 exhibits\ngeometry of a very different type, involving an action by the 2 \u00d7 2 diagonal matrix \u03c6(t)\n(see Section 2) also seen on the unit tangent bundle PSL(2, Z)\\PSL(2, R) of the modular\nsurface [10].\nThe theory described in Subsection 7.2, or rather its generalizations to four dimensions\ntailored to symplectic geometry [6, 13], is likely to be relevant in solving the problem in\na general non-Lagrangian setting.\nIn another direction, one can vary the ambient almost-K\u00e4hler structure. As a first\nstep, the result of Corollary 4.5 can be extended to 'separable' symplectic forms such as\n\u03a9(x, y) = f (x)e14 + g(y)e23. Such calculations lead one to postulate further Calabi\u2013Yau\nesistence results.\nReferences\n\n[1] E. Abbena, An example of an almost K\u00e4hler manifold which is not K\u00e4hlerian, Boll. Un.
