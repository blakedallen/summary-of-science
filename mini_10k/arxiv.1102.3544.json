CMB radiation \u2013 analysis of CMB spectrum \u2013 radial distribution function of objects \u2013 early universe cluster structure \u2013\n\ndensity of ordinary matter\n\n1. Introduction\nThe angular power spectrum (anisotropy spectrum) of the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation (Sievers 2003;\nHinshaw 2003) shows incredible similarity with X-ray or neutron scattering measured on non-crystalline materials (\u010cervinka\n1998, \u010cervinka et al. 2005), see Figs. 1 and 2. Astronomers ascribe to various peaks of the anisotropy spectrum of the CMB radiation different processes (Hu 1995): It is the Sachs-Wolf effect,\nDoppler effect, Silk damping, Rees-Sciama effect, SunyaevZeldovich effect, etc. In this connection it should be stated that\nall theoretical predictions of the standard cosmological model\nare in very good agreement with the course of the anisotropy\nspectrum of CMB radiation. However, the formal similarity in\nthe form of both figures initiates the tempting idea if an analysis\nof the anisotropy spectrum of relict radiation using an analogous\napproach as is common in solid state physics, i.e. in the structural\nanalysis of disordered materials, would bring more information\non the structure of the early universe.\nThe inspiration for this approach we found further in\nthe nowadays situation: Although the individual disciplines in\nphysics are highly specialized, nevertheless their methods and\nresults are shared in areas that at the first sight may seem to be\nfar apart. An example of this is the already established use of\nelementary particle physics in cosmology.\n\nSimilarly, we hope that it may be time now to apply the\nformalism of solid state physics to some special cosmological\nproblems and in this way to provide an additional tool for their\nresearch. First of all our new approach may be useful in the analysis of the CMB data. We will show how after a transformation\nof the anisotropy spectrum of relict radiation into a special twofold reciprocal space we will be able to process the transformed\nCMB anisotropy spectrum by a Fourier transform and thus calculate a radial distribution function (RDF) of Objects in a reciprocal space. Because the CMB radiation reflects the fluctuations\nin the density of the matter, we hope that in this way our study\nwill be able to contribute to the understanding of the structure of\nthese density fluctuations (Sect. 3).\nMoreover this work points quite unequivocally to clustering\nprocesses and to a cluster-like structure of the matter, hence it\nsheds more light on the structure of the universe in the moment\nwhen the universe became transparent for photons (Sect. 4).\nClustering may be at the same time a new physical effect\nwhich has not been taken fully into consideration in the past. On\nthe basis of our quantitative considerations it will be possible to\nderive the number of particles (protons, helium nuclei, electrons)\nin Objects and Clusters and of Clusters in an Object. This point\nwill be demonstrated in Sect. 4.2. and discussed in Sect. 5.1.\nAnother analysis based on a calculation of the CMB radiation spectrum after its transformation into a simple reciprocal\n1\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\n2.

The reciprocal space scattering vector s is defined in equation (A.5).\n\nspace, combined with appropriate modelling experiments, will\nconfirm the cluster structure and indicate the differences between\nObjects and Clusters, see Sects. 4.1. and 4.2.\nMoreover, we will propose on the basis of this new formalism a general description of the interaction of relict radiation with the matter. In contrast to the atomic (coherent) and\nCompton (incoherent) scattering factors calculated theoretically\nfor all kinds of atoms in solid state physics, in this special case\nwe have generated a relict radiation factor unifying all possible\nprocesses realized during the interaction of relict radiation with\nvarious kinds of particles, see Sects. 2.2.4. and 5.2.\n2\n\nIn solid state physics the principal mathematical method during\nthe structure analysis of the matter is the Fourier transform of the\nintensity e.g. of X-rays or neutrons scattered by atoms building\nthe material. The experimental data are collected in the reciprocal space and their Fourier transform brings the required information on the distribution of atoms in the real space. Now we\nwill try to apply this approach to the CMB spectrum (see Fig.\n1) and simultaneously point out the complications we have to\novercome in this direction.\nThe necessary basic mathematical apparatus is summarized\nin the Appendix, the most important basic equations for the analysis of scattered radiation and leading to the radial density distribution function (RDF) are equations (A.1) and (A.2). The essential difference in the use of terms \"scattering\" and \"interaction\"\nof photons will be elucidated in the next Sect. 2.1.1.\n2.1. Discussion of parameters necessary for the calculation\nof a radial electron density distribution\n2.1.1. The relict radiation factor\n\nDuring a conventional structure analysis with X-rays or neutrons, the X-ray or neutron atomic scattering factors are a precise picture of the interaction of radiation with the matter and\nare known precisely (Wilson & Price 1999). They enter into the\ncalculation of the RDF in correspondence with the composition\nof the studied material; see equations (A.6), (A.7) and (A.10).\nGenerally, for coherent scattering, the atomic scattering factor\nf is the ratio of the amplitude of X-rays scattered by a given\natom Ea and that scattered according to the classical theory by\none single electron Ee , i.e. f = Ea /Ee ( f \u2264 Z), where Z is the\nnumber of electrons in the atom.\nMoreover, there are scattering factors not only for the coherent but also for the incoherent (Compton) type of scattering, see\ne.g. later on Fig. 7.\nIn our study, however, the basic obstacle is that with CMB\nphotons we have not a classic scattering process of photons on\natoms; i.e. a process described in equations of the Appendix.\nThere are not atoms, there are particles only (e.g. baryons, electrons, etc.), which participate in the formation of the structure\nof density fluctuations. Therefore we will speak throughout this\narticle about an \"interaction\" instead of \"scattering\" in all cases\nwhen instead of the classic \"atomic scattering factor\" the new\n\"relict radiation factor\" will be used.\nIt is true that a part of the interaction of photons with electrons before the recombination may be realised as Thomson scattering (elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a free\ncharged particle, as described by classical electromagnetism) 1 ,\nbut the physical background as well as the complex picture of\nphysical processes describing the interaction of relict photons\nwith the non uniform matter composed of various particles (electrons, ions, etc.) is not known precisely.\nIt is therefore evident that it will not be possible to use the\nconventional atomic scattering factors and that a new special factor reflecting the complexity of interaction processes of photons\nwith the primordial matter has to be constructed. We only point\nout that the description of these interactions is possible only in a\n1\nIt is just the low-energy limit of Compton scattering: the particle\nkinetic energy and photon frequency are the same before and after the\nscattering, however this limit is valid as long as the photon energy is\nmuch less than the mass energy of the particle.\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\nspecial two-fold reciprocal space into which the CMB spectrum\nis transformed. This new factor will be called the relict radiation factor and substitutes all complicated processes which participate in the formation of the angular power spectrum of CMB\nradiation.\nIn this way this approach and-or formalism may also shed\nsome new light on the (well-known) physical processes taking\nplace in the primordial plasma.\nIn order to construct the relict radiation factor we will use a\nbasic mathematical criterion which serves well also in the classic\ncase (see also later on Sect. 2.2.4.): Only when the atomic coherent and incoherent scattering factors (for X-rays or neutrons) are\nincluded into the calculation correctly, then the Fourier transform of the quantity i(s) according equation (A.2) presents data\nwithout or with minimal parasitic fluctuations. Similarly also in\nthis case this criterion should help us during the construction of\nthe relict radiation factor: The relict radiation factor has to be\nconstructed in such a way that after its insertion into the calculation of the RDF (see equations (A.1) and (A.6), where the relict\nradiation factor is then labelled fm , possible parasitic fluctuations\non the RDF \u03c1(r) should be again minimized to the greatest possible extent.\nThe construction of the relict radiation factor is presented in\nSect. 2.2.4.\n2.1.2. The wavelength of radiation\n\nThe wavelength of radiation is a quantity of highest importance,\ntoo. It follows from equation (A.5), that the greater the wavelength the smaller is the maximal possible value smax of the reciprocal space vector. At the same time the upper limit of the\nintegral in equation (A.2) strongly influences the quality of the\nFourier transform.\nAlthough there is a broad distribution of wavelengths of photons (see later on the discussion in Sect. 5.3.) the calculation will\nbe undertaken for the wavelength corresponding to the maximum of the wavelength distribution, i.e. for the wavelength \u03bb\n= 1.9 [mm] corresponding to the temperature 2.725 [K] of the\nUniverse today.\nThat this wavelength is rational is based on three arguments.\nFirst of all photons with this wavelength bring us today the information on their last several interactions with particles, in the\nsecond place the CMB radiation spectrum is the same for all\nwavelengths and in the third place the wavelength corresponding to the maximum of the wavelength distribution secures the\nhighest probability of the interaction process of photons with the\nmatter.\n2.1.3. The macroscopic density\n\nThe macroscopic density is a parameter which contributes to the\ncalculation of the first expression on the right side of equation\n(A.2), i.e. it characterises \"the slope\" of the total disorder, see\ne.g. Fig.8. The calculation only of the second member of equation (A.2) may help in an estimate of this quantity, because it\nis highly improbable that oscillations on a properly calculated\nRDF should be negative. This fact has been used when estimating the density of the matter, see Sect. 3.2. It is important that the\nbasic features of a RDF (positions of coordination spheres) are\nalready determined by the calculation only of the second member in equation (A.2).\n\n2.2. Preparatory calculations\n2.2.1. The Classic reciprocal space\n\nDuring a classic scattering experiment we measure the intensity\nof the scattered radiation (e.g. X-rays) as a function of the scattering angle \u03b8Classic . This scattering angle describes in real space\nthe angle between the incident and scattered radiation. Its relation with the scattering vector in reciprocal space was described\nin equation (A.5).\nOn the other hand the angle \u03b1 in the anisotropy spectrum of\nrelict radiation (see already Fig. 1) is not a scattering angle. It is\nan angle characterizing a distance between an arbitrary point to\nanother - in those different points the temperature fluctuation is\nmeasured and compared with the overall medium one.\nIn order to overcome the incomparableness between the angles \u03b8 and \u03b1 we will construct an angle dependent reciprocal\nspace to the angle \u03b1. The basic quantity determining this reciprocal space will be the scattering angle \u03b8Classic .\nWe will suppose that the maximum possible value of the\nmax\nclassic scattering angle \u03b8Classic\n= 90\u25e6 corresponds to the maximum value of the multipole moment Lmax =3000.\nAs a consequence we receive a transformation coefficient Q\nmax\n\u03b8Classic\n= Q Lmax\n\n(1)\n\n(its value in this case is Q = 0.03).

It should be\nnoted that the quantities sClassic and \u03b1 are in an indirect relation.\nThe space of the vector sClassic will be further on called a \"classic reciprocal space\".\nIt should be pointed out that in this construction (see equation (6)) the scattering vector sClassic is defined in the reciprocal\nspace (1/\u03bb) and that this space is now dipped into the reciprocal space (1/\u03b1), see equations (2), (4) and (6). For this \"dipping\"\nwe will use further on the expression that the space sClassic is a\n2-fold reciprocal space to the space \u03b1.\nThe recalculation of the original data presented in Fig. 1 using equations (4) and (6) is shown in Fig. 3.

Relation between the Classic and Relict reciprocal\nspace\n\nNow it is possible to find an L-dependent transformation coefficient C(L) for which\n\nThe Classic reciprocal space was defined in equation (6), which\ncan be rewritten, using equation (2) into an L-dependent form\n\nsClassic = C(L)\n\nsin(LQ)\n(10)\n\u03bb\nSimilarly the Relict reciprocal space was defined in equation\n(9), which can be rewritten using equation (8) also into an Ldependent form\nsClassic = 4\u03c0\n\nsin(180\u25e6/L)\n(11)\n\u03bb\nIn Fig. 5 we show the dependencies sClassic (L) and S Relict (L)\nsimultaneously with the function 1/S Relict (L).\nS Relict = 4\u03c0\n\n4\n\n1\n,\nS Relict\n\n(12)\n\nwhere e.g. for the wavelength \u03bb = 0.071069 [nm] the coefficient\nC(L) (dimensionality [nm\u22122 ]) has the course visualised in Fig.\n5. In reality the coefficient C is not only a function of L but\nsimultaneously a function of \u03bb, i.e. precisely it should be written\nas C(L, \u03bb). 2\nEquation (12) is important, because it enables the mutual\ncomparison of the Classic reciprocal space (represented by vec2\n\nThat C is a function of \u03bb then indicates that for every wavelength\nthere has to be another calculation of equation (12) and simultaneously\nthere has to be another calculation of equations (6) and (9).\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\nf\n\n1,0\n\nincoh\n\n[e]\n\nIgas\n\nInorm\n\nfRelict\n\n0,8\nX\n\n1,0\n\n\u03bb = 0.071069 [nm]\n\nX\n\n\u03bb = 0.071069 [nm]\n\nAtomic factors fRelict and f\n\nIntensity [Arbitrary units]\n\n1,5\n\n0,5\n\nIdistr\n0,0\n\n-0,5\n\n-1,0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n0,6\n\n0,4\nX\n\nf\n\n0,0\n0\n\n180\n\ncoh\n\n0,2\n\n-1\n\n50\n\n100\n\nsClassic and s\n\nsClassic [nm ]\n\n150\n-1\n\nX\nclassic\n\n[nm ]\n\nFig. 6.

To summarize: the mutual relationship\nbetween the Classic reciprocal space and the Relict reciprocal\nspace is reciprocal.\n\nIn Fig. 6 we see that the function Inorm (s) is properly oscillating along the function Igas (s) and therefore the function Idistr (s)\nis properly oscillating along the zero line. The consequence is\nthat we will obtain a \"proper\" radial distribution function, i.e.\nwithout any parasitic maxima, see Sect. 3.1.\n\n2.2.4. Construction of the relict radiation factor\n\nGenerally, a correct scattering factor has to fulfil three criterions:\n(A) the Inorm (s) curve should oscillate along the Igas (s) curve\nand as a consequence according equation (A.9)\n(B) the curve Idistr (s) should oscillate along the zero value of\nthe intensity axis;\n(C) the resulting RDF must not be contaminated by parasitic\nfluctuations due to bad scaling (see Sect. A2.) as a consequence\nof a bad course of the scattering factor.\nThe mutual relation between quantities Inorm (s), Igas (s) and\nIdistr (s) is explained in the Appendix, see equations (A.9), (A.10)\nand (B.1) with (B.2).\nIn Fig. 6 the calculation of the crucial curve Igas is undertaken\nfor the relict radiation factor fRelict . The form of this factor was\ndetermined by the trial and error method and is shown in Fig.\n7. In this figure is the factor fRelict compared with the coherent\nX\nX\n) and incoherent ( fincoh\n) atomic scattering factors for X-rays\n( fcoh\ncorresponding to the Hydrogen atom (Wilson & Price 1999).\nSimilarly as for X-rays we have set the relict radiation factor\nfRelict\nfRelict = 1\n\nfor\n\ns = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nand further, we have set in equation (A.7) Z = 1 and m = 1,\nhence in equation (A.6) is Km = 1. From this point of view our\nconstruction of the relict radiation factor fRelict should formally\ncorrespond to a \"hydrogen-like\" particle.\nFurther we have to point out that in connection with the presentation of the quantity Igas (s) in equation (A.10) its course in\nFig. 6 is given now by the relation\nX\n2\nIgas (s) =\n.\n(14)\nam fRelict\nm\n\n2.2.5. Relation between the Classic and Relict distribution of\ndistances\n\nWe rewrite now the basic equation (A.2) using the scattering vector in the Classic reciprocal space sClassic , see equation (6)\n\u03c1(r[nm\u2217 ]) = \u03c1Medium\n(r) + \u03c1Fourier (r, I(sClassic )) ,\n0\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c1Medium\n(r) is the member which is not Fourier-dependent\n0\nand describes the structure-less total disorder depending on the\ndensity of the matter.\nThe parameter r is measured in [nm*] in order to emphasize\nthat the calculation of the RDF \u03c1(r) is realized on the basis of the\nparameter sClassic , which is dipped in a 2-fold reciprocal space\n(see Sect. 2.2.1.). In other words: the calculation of the RDF \u03c1(r)\nis realized in the reciprocal space of classic distances, which\nhave the dimension [nm*]. Here we again point out the fact, that\nclassic distances are distances between Objects calculated on the\nbasis of the function IClassic(sClassic ), see Fig. 3, which we analyze\nusing equation (15).\nIn order to receive now the information in the real space\nof classic distances (characterized by the parameter R) we must\ncalculate the reciprocal value of the parameter r , hence the relation between r and R is\n1\n= R [nm] .\nr[nm\u2217 ]\n\n(16)\n\nIt would be now possible to rewrite quite formally equation\n(A.2) using the scattering vector in the Relict reciprocal space\nS Relict , see equation (9). Similarly as for equation (15) we would\nreceive\n\u03c1(R) = \u03c1Medium\n(R) + \u03c1Fourier (R, I(S Relict )) .\n0\n\n(17)\n5\n\n\f-3\n\nD = 108.6 [kg.m ]\n\n30\n25\n2\n\n2\n\n2,5\n2,0\n\nmin\n\n1\n\n1\n\n15\n\nr\n\nr\n\n10\n\nr = 0.312\n\n0\n\nr = 0.172\n\n5\n0\n-5\nmin\n\nr = 0.348\n\n-10\n-15\n0,0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,7\n\n0,8\n\n0,9\n\n0.250\n\n1,5\n0,154\n\n1,0\n\n0.111\n0.071\n\n0,5\n0,0\n\n0,0\n\n1,0\n\n0,1\n\nQuite hypothetically the RDF \u03c1(r) would then bring us information on the real space of relict distances, which have the\ndimension [nm]. Actually, however, a RDF will not be calculated in this case, because the distribution I(S Relict ), see Fig. 4, is\nnot convenient for a Fourier transform. The calculation of relict\ndistances in the real space, i.e. of distances between complex\nObjects (big clusters) will be done on the basis of a theoretical calculation of the function I(S Relict ) using the Debye formula\n(18) calculated for appropriate models, see later on Sect. 4.\n\n3.1. Calculation of RDFs\n\nIn our first example we calculate in Fig. 8 the RDF of\nObjects corresponding to the Fourier transform of intensities\n\u03c1Fourier (r, I(sClassic )) for the wavelength \u03bb = 0.071069 [nm], see\nequation (15). The scaling of intensities has been already demonstrated in Fig. 6 on the basis of the relict radiation factor fRelict\nconstructed in Fig. 7.\nThe calculated RDF shows a form typical for RDFs obtained\nfor disordered materials. It turns out that in the region from 0.1 to\n0.4 [nm*] most essential are the maxima 1 r and 2 r separated by\na minimum min r , which are followed by a structure-less course.\nSuch behaviour indicates the existence of ordering in the matter.\nIn other words, there is a distinctive separation of the matter ending its ordering by the sphere at 0.312 [nm*] from the residual\nstructure-less ordering starting with a plain peak at 0.395 [nm*].\nThe small maximum 0 r located at 0.172 [nm*] we consider for\nthe present as irrelevant.\nIn the same way we calculated RDFs for four more wavelengths, i.e. 0.110674 [nm] (\u03bbSeK\u03b1 ), 0.154178 [nm] (\u03bbCuK\u03b1 ),\n0.250466 [nm] (\u03bbVK\u03b1 ) and 0.537334 [nm] (\u03bbSK\u03b1 ). From these\ncalculations it follows that, as expected, the dependence of the\nmagnitude of corresponding coordination spheres on the wavelength \u03bb is linear, see Fig. 9, moreover, all RDFs have the same\nappearance.\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n1E7\nExtrapolated values\n\n1000000\n100000\n10000\n1000\n\nCalculated\nvalues\n\u03bb = 1 900 000 [nm]\n\n100\n\n= 1.9 [mm]\n\n10\n1\n119 [m])\n\n0,1\n0,01\n\n3.

This recalculation is realized in Table 1, where we review the results from all wavelengths (Fig. 9) and simultaneously extrapolate the distances to\nthe wavelength of relict radiation photons \u03bb=1.9 [mm].\nReal space distances between Objects calculated in Table 1\nare visualized in Fig. 10. The extrapolation to the wavelength\nof relict photons 1.9 [mm] indicates that for this wavelength the\nshortest Object distances are in the range between 100 to 120\nmeters. In all further considerations, however, we will use as\nthe most distinctive number characterizing the distance between\nObjects the value 2 R describing the start of the structure-less region, i.e. the distance 2 R = 98\u00b12 [m].\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\nTable 1.

Calculation of the density\n\nThe results are summarized in Fig. 11 and Table 2. In the logscale is the dependence of density on the wavelength nearly linear and therefore enables again an extrapolation to higher wavelengths. This extrapolation is presented in Table 2 and visualized\nin Fig. 12.\nIt follows from Table 2 and Fig. 12 that the most probable medium density of density fluctuations of the matter with\nwhich CMB (relict) photons realized their last interaction is\nD=9\u00d710\u221223 [kg.m\u22123 ]. Taking in account the limits of our calculation then the density can be formally written as D \u223c 10\u221222 \u00b1\n10\u22123 [kg.m\u22123]. see also Fig. 12 and Table 2.\n\n4.

In order to find the best fit with the scattering curve according equation (18), the distance between Clusters\n(tetrahedrons) had to be d = 3 [nm], i.e. the tetrahedrons were located in positions of the basic skeleton characterized now by a\nside a = 6.93 [nm]. This model had 22\u00d75 particles, i.e. a total of\n110 particles. This calculation is shown in Fig. 14.\nFor all other wavelengths (\u03bb \u2265 0.110674 [nm]) we had to\nincrease the dimensions of the Cluster. The Cluster had then\nthe form of the skeleton shown in Fig. 13 with an edge 0.607\n[nm] and consisted of 22 particles (again with an inter-particle\ndistance 0.263 [nm]) embedded in 8 edge-bound tetrahedrons.\n\nOnly this Cluster occupied the \"positions\" of the cubic skeleton\nshown in Fig. 13 forming now an Object. (A more instructive\nschematic presentation of an Object is shown in Fig. 18 where\nClusters are presented as small darker circles filled with \"particles\".) When changing the dimension of this skeleton, we simultaneously changed again the distance d between Clusters. In\norder to reach for \u03bb = 0.110674 [nm] the correct position of the\nmassive peak at 1.6 [nm\u22121 ] an inter-Cluster distance d = 4.65\n[nm] had to be used, i.e. the dimension of the skeleton was characterized by the side a = 10.74 [nm].

This fact enabled an extrapolation\nof the Cluster distance d to the wavelength of relict photons\n\u03bb=1.9 [nm], see Table 3. This extrapolated distance is dRelict =\n(12\u00b11)[cm]. The extrapolation is visualized in Fig. 17.\nIt should be noted that the recalculated anisotropy spectrum\ndepends in this case directly on the angle \u03b8Relict which is equal to\nthe angle \u03b1 (see equation (8)) and therefore a recalculation of the\ninter-Cluster distance d into a real space distance is not necessary\nbecause the Debye formula analyzes the Relict reciprocal space\nrepresented by the vector S Relict directly in real space distances,\nsee the quantity di j in equation (18).\n\nFig. 17.

Consequences of previous calculations\n\nWe are now able to calculate easily the number of Clusters in one\nObject. Because an Object consists of NpartO \u2248 1011 particles in\none Object (equation (28)) and there are N partC \u2248 102 particles in\none Cluster, it follows that an Object should be composed from\nNC Clusters, where\nNC = (NpartO /N partC ) \u2248 1011 /102 \u2248 109\n\nClusters.\n\n(36)\n\nSupposing that densities in the Object and in the Cluster are\nequal then this value is independent on the value of the density\nand on the mass of the particle (e.g. m1:1:1\npart ) and depends only on\nthe relation of the volumes VO /VC , because\nNC = (NpartO /N partC ) = VO /VC\n= 1.449 \u00d7 106 [m3 ]/2.66 \u00d7 10\u22123 [m3 ]\n\u2248 109 Clusters.\n\n(37)\n\n5. Discussion\nIn the following discussion we will concentrate on several important ideas which may arise when reading this paper.\nFirst of all this contribution should demonstrate how the formalism imported from solid state physics could be useful in solving specific cosmological problems: It may shed some new light\non the physical processes taking place in the primordial plasma.\nFor example, this work points quite unequivocally to clustering processes and to a cluster-like structure of the matter in the\nmoment when the universe became transparent for photons (see\nSect. 5.1.).\nFurther, the new formalism enabled us a simple and general\ndescription of the interaction of relict radiation with the matter\nand may help in an improvement of the theoretical predictions\nof the CMB pattern (see Sect. 5.2.).\nFinally this new approach may be useful in the analysis of\nthe CMB data. We have shown that the transformation of the\nanisotropy spectrum of relict radiation into a special two-fold\nreciprocal space and into a simple reciprocal space was able to\nbring quantitative data in real space. Problems with the transformation into reciprocal spaces, mainly with the use of the proper\nwavelength of relict photons will be discussed in Sect. 5.3.\n5.1. The cluster-like structure of the primordial matter\n\nWe have already mentioned that the process of forming the primordial matter by particle clustering may be a new physical effect which has not been fully taken into consideration in the past.\nNow we present a model of the cluster-like structure\nConcerning our results on the distances between Objects and\nClusters, we have arrived to three numbers, which we interpret\nin a following way: The first one, which is 98 [m], (Table 1) indicates the distance between Objects (big clusters), the second\none, which is 12 [cm], (Table 3) indicates the distance between\nsmaller Clusters, while the internal structure of a single Cluster\nis formed by 22 particles and is characterized by a medium particle distance 0.26 [nm], see Sect. 4.1.\nIn Fig.18 we show a schematic picture of the cluster model.\nThe big circle represents an Object. An Object is a clump of\nClusters, where only a part of this clump was simulated in our\nmodel by 22 Clusters each having 22 particles, i.e. by a total of\n484 particles in an Object.\nAlthough this model gave a sufficiently well agreement with\nthe width of the massive peak, as demonstrated in Fig. 15, our\n\nFig. 18. A schematic arrangement of Clusters (darker regions)\nwith particles (small white points) in an Object (white region).\nDistance between Objects is \u223c98 [m], see Table 1. Detailed\nstructure of a Cluster and of an Object in our model is presented\nin Fig. 13. The most probable model distance between Clusters\nis 12 [cm], see Table 3. Distance between particles is 0.26 [nm].\nThere are \u223c1011 particles in one Object, \u223c102 particles in one\nCluster (see Sect. 4.2.) and \u223c109 Clusters in one Object, see Sect.\n4.2.\n\nestimates (Sect. 4.2.) show that the number of Clusters as well as\nthe number of particles in one Cluster is greater., i.e. that there\nmay be as far as 1011 particles in one Object and 102 particles\nin one Cluster. That the density plays an important role in these\ncalculations will be discussed in Sect. 5.4.\nIt is important to note that the distance between Objects\n(2 R=98[m], see Table 1) is not identical with the dimension of\nthe Object as defined in Sect. 4.1. There the dimension of an\nObject was determined by the inter-Cluster distance dCluster =\n0.12 [m] (see Table 3). This distance is a quarter of the body\ndiagonal in the cube-like skeleton (with an edge aObject = 0.28\n[m]) simulating the Object according Fig. 13. The dimension of\nan Object is then determined by the diameter of a sphere surrounding Clusters located in the skeleton \"positions\". The value\nof this diameter is 2RObject = 0.48 [m], i.e. much smaller than\n2\nR=98[m].\nWe have already mentioned (see Sect. 4.1.) that in principle it is not possible to solve on the basis of the massive peak\n(located e.g. at S Relict = 1.62 [nm\u22121 ] for \u03bb = 0.1107 [nm], see\nFig. 15) the internal structure of a Cluster. It is possible to reach\nonly information on the Cluster magnitude and on the distance\nbetween Clusters.\nJust this information we have derived from our model calculations: The magnitude of a Cluster was based on the particle\ndistance 0.263 [nm] and was defined by a cube with an edge\naCluster = 0.607 [nm] (see Fig. 13), which may be surrounded by\na sphere with a radius RCluster = 0.53 [nm], hence a diameter of a\nCluster has the value 2RCluster = 1.05 [nm]. It is important to note\nthat this diameter, similarly as for Objects, is not identical with\nthe distance between Clusters (12 [cm]), see Fig. 18. However, it\nis this distance, which influences the position of the peak, while\n11\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\nits intensity depends on the number of particles in the Cluster\nand their \"mass\" represented by their \"scattering\" power (i.e. by\ntheir relict radiation factor).\nInteresting may be the effect of changing the inter-Cluster\ndistance: A decrease of the inter-Cluster distance from 12 cm to\ne.g. 10 cm would bring for the 1:1:1 mixture of particles (see\nSect. 4.2.2.) a value of 25 particles in one Cluster and for the\n1:1:10 mixture of particles a value of 100 particles in a Cluster,\ni.e. numbers which roughly correspond to our model numbers\nin Sect. 4.1. Similarly a greater proportion of heavier particles\nshould decrease the number of particles, thus again corresponding to the model number.\nEven when the cluster model gave a good profile of the massive peak at e.g. 1.62 [nm], than such a model cannot be a unique\none, because the calculation of the profile is not sensitive to the\ninternal cluster structure, however, the cluster-like character of\nthe modelling process has to be maintained.\nHow it was possible to estimate on the basis of inter-Cluster\nand inter-Object distances the number of particles (protons, helium nuclei, electrons) in Objects and Clusters and of Clusters in\nan Object was demonstrated in Sects. 4.2. and 4.3., however how\nthese numbers are influenced by the density will be discussed in\nSect. 5.4.\n5.2. The relict radiation factor\n\nWe have already pointed out in Sect. 2.1.1. why during the analysis of the CMB spectrum it has not been possible to apply conventional atomic scattering factors used in solid state physics\nand why a new special factor reflecting the complexity of interaction processes of photons with the primordial matter has to be\nconstructed. It is important to have in mind that the description\nof these interactions is possible only in a special two-fold reciprocal space into which the CMB spectrum was transformed. We\nhave called this new factor the relict radiation factor and it had\nto substitute all complicated processes which participate in the\nformation of the angular power spectrum of CMB radiation, see\nSect. 2.2.\nBecause relict photons realize their interaction with various\nkinds of particles and we have generated only one radiation factor, this factor represents, as a matter of fact, a medium from all\npossible individual relict radiation factors. In this way this new\nformalism offers a general description of the interaction of relict\nradiation with the matter and simultaneously reflects the complexity of processes which influence the anisotropy spectrum of\nCMB radiation from the cosmological point of view (Hu et al.\n1995).\nDuring our study we have concentrated on three important\nfacts which may justify the attempt to interpret the anisotropy\nspectrum of CMB radiation as a consequence of the interaction\nof photons with density fluctuations characterizing the distribution of particles before the recombination process.\nThe first fact is that temperature fluctuations in the CMB\nspectrum are related to fluctuations in the density of matter in\nthe early universe and thus carry information about the initial\nconditions for the formation of cosmic structures such as galaxies, clusters or voids (Wright 1994).\nSecondly, it is the fact that the information on these density\nfluctuations in the distribution of particles (electrons, ions, etc.)\nhas been brought by photons. Photons which we observe from\nthe microwave background have traveled freely since the matter\nwas highly ionized and they realized their last Thomson scattering (see already Sect. 2.1.1.). If there has been no significant\nearly heat input from galaxy formation then this happened when\n12\n\nthe Universe became cool enough for the protons to capture electrons, i.e. when the recombination process started (White 1994).\nThe third fact is that the anisotropy spectrum is angular dependent, see Fig. 1.\nAlthough we know that the anisotropy spectrum of CMB radiation, as presented in Fig. 1, has no direct connection with a\nscattering process of photons, it was the transformation of the\nCMB spectrum into a two-fold reciprocal space, which enabled\nus to interpret the anisotropy spectrum of CMB radiation as a result of an interaction process of photons with density fluctuations\nof the matter represented by electrons, ions or other particles.\nThis approach enabled us to reach an advantageous approximation of this process.\nThe process consisted of two steps: First of all we have constructed in Sect. 2.2.1. an angular reciprocal space characterized\nby the \"scattering\" angle \u03b8Classic , see equations (2) and (4). This\nspace is reciprocal to the space characterized by the angle \u03b1 (\u03b1 is\nthe angle between two points in which temperature fluctuations\nof CMB radiation are compared to an overall medium temperature).\nThen, we have constructed an additional \"classic\" reciprocal space (1/\u03bb) into which the first one (the \u03b8Classic , space) was\ndipped, by defining in this new \"two-fold\" reciprocal space the\nclassic scattering vector sClassic , see equation (6). Only after these\ntransformations we treated in this new Classic reciprocal space\nthe transformed anisotropy CMB spectrum as a scattering picture of relict photons.\nIt was only this space in which we simulated (in Sect. 2.2.4.)\nthe interaction of CMB (relict) photons with density fluctuations\nby the relict radiation factor fRelict .\nThe criterion for the trial and error construction of the relict\nradiation factor fRelict has been that this factor had to fulfill the\nthree requirements set at the beginning of Sect. 2.2.4. Only then\nit was secured that after the Fourier transform, according equations (A.2) and-or (15), there will not be any (or at least small)\nparasitic fluctuations on the curve \u03c1(r) and-or \u03c1Fourier (r). That we\nhave achieved these demands is documented in Fig. 8 where we\ndo not see any parasitic fluctuations on the curve \u03c1Fourier (r) and\nas a consequence on the curve \u03c1(r).\nTo summarize: It is true that in our formal analogy between\nscattering of e.g. short-wave radiation on disordered matter (Fig.\n2) and \"scattering\" of CMB photons on electrons, ions and other\nparticles (Fig. 1) is an essential difference, because the physical\nprocesses are completely different, e.g. the scattering process itself, length scales involved, etc., however, the difference between\nphysical processes is reflected and simultaneously eliminated by\nthe special relict radiation factor fRelict (Sect. 2.2.4.), which we\nhave included into all calculations based on the classic two-fold\nreciprocal space (see Sect. 2.1.). Moreover, additional calculations in the Relict reciprocal space (see Sect. 4.) based on the\nrelict radiation factor were done directly for the transformed angular power spectrum of relict radiation (see IRelict (S Relict ) in Fig.\n4) and thus present an information on distance relations between\nClusters (formed by particles) in real space.\n5.3. The wavelength problem\n\nThe problem is to which wavelength of relict photons we have\nto relate our calculations. One possibility may be to refer this\nwavelength to that time when 379.000 years after the Big Bang\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\n5.4. The density of the mass and distances between\nObjects, Clusters and particles\n\nThe way how we arrived to numbers characterizing the density\nof the matter was described in Sect. 3.2. In a conventional X-ray\nanalysis the density is the macroscopic density of the material\nunder study. Therefore we suppose that also in this case the density which influences the parabolic shape of the curve of total\ndisorder (see the first member on the right side of equation (A.2)\nand-or (15) and Fig.8) should be understood as a real medium\ndensity of density fluctuations.\nThe dependence of the density on the wavelength as demonstrated in Figs. 11 and 12 is not perfectly linear; therefore we\nhave marked in Fig. 12 the extent of possible linear dependences.\nThis result can be formally written as\nD = 10\u221222 \u00b1 10\u22123 [kg.m\u22123].\n\n(39)\n5\n\nFig. 19. Dependence of the intensity of the CMB radiation on\nfrequency as measured by the COBE Far InfraRed Absolute\nSpectrophotometer (FIRAS) (Mather et al. 1994; Wright et al.\n1994). The thick curve is the experimental result; the points are\ntheoretically calculated for an absolute black body with a temperature of 2.725 [K]. The x axis variable is the frequency \u03bd in\n[cm\u22121 ]. The y-axis variable is the power per unit area per unit\nfrequency per unit solid angle in MegaJanskies per steradian (1\n[Jansky] is a unit of measurement of flux density used in radioastronomy, abbreviated \"Jy\" (1 [Jansky] is 10\u221226 [W.m\u22122 .Hz\u22121 ]).\nthe Universe cooled down to 3000 K and the ionization of atoms\ndecreased already only to 1%. Then according Wien's law\nb\n(38)\nT\nwhere \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength, T is the absolute temperature of the blackbody, and b is a constant of proportionality\ncalled Wien's displacement constant, b = 2.8978\u00d710\u22123 [mK],\nwe obtain for the temperature 3000 K a wavelength value \u03bbmax\n= 966 [nm] (\u0160m\u0131\u0301da 2010).\nHowever, simultaneously we must be aware of the fact that\nwe are analyzing CMB photons now when the temperature of the\nuniverse, due to its expansion, is 2.725 K. Then the wavelength\nof photons according the Wien's law should be \u223c1 [mm].\nOn the other hand the COsmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) measured with the Far Infrared Absolute\nSpectrophotometer (FIRAS) the frequency spectrum of the\nCMB, which is very close to a blackbody with a temperature\n2.725 K (Mather et al. 1994; Wright et al. 1994). The results are\nshown in Fig. 19 in units of intensity (see the text to Fig. 19). It\nfollows that the wavelength corresponding to the maximum is\n1.9 [mm].\nAfter all we have decided to relate our results to the wavelength of CMB photons 1.9 [mm] which corresponds to the maximum of the intensity distribution. Because the distribution of\nthe spectrum covers a relatively broad interval of wavelengths,\nsee Fig. 19, calculations based on the wavelength 1.9 [mm]\nshould then represent the most probable calculation and estimate\npresented in this study. Moreover, this consideration is supported\nby the fact that the angular distribution of CMB radiation is the\nsame for all wavelengths.\nHowever, on the basis of graphs in Figs. 10, 12 and 16 an\neasy recalculation of distances and-or of the density would be\npossible when another CMB photons wavelength would be considered as more appropriate.\n\n\u03bbmax =\n\nIt follows that this medium value is about 10 times higher\nthan the \"critical density\" Dcritical = (5 to 7)\u00d710\u221227 [kg.m\u22123]\n(Smoot & Davidson (1977), Silk (1977)), see Table 2.\nIn this connection a remark should be added on the influence of the density on the calculated numbers of particles in\nObjects and Clusters (see Sects. 4.2.1. and 4.2.2.). Having in\nmind the value of the density (expression (39)) and repeating\nthe calculations in these sections for the upper and lower density\nlimit, we will receive the number of particles in an Object in the\nrange from 108 to 1014 and the number of particles in a Cluster\nin the range from 0 to 105 particles. Because a Cluster cannot\nbe \"empty\", the latter numbers indicate that the lower density\nlimit should be higher and could reach a more probable value of\n\u223c 10\u221223 [kg.m\u22123 ]. Hence the value of the density may be then\nformally written as D=10\u221222 \u00b1 10\u22121 [kg.m\u22123].\nFurther, we should have in mind that the local density in a\nCluster or in an Object has to be greater. We are able to document this fact on the basis of our Cluster model. Based on particle distances d particles = 0.263 [nm], we have simulated a part\nof the Cluster structure by a cube with an edge aCluster = 0.607\n[nm]. There were 22 particles in this cube which can be closed in\na sphere with a radius RCluster = 2d particles = 0.53 [nm]. The volume of this sphere is VCluster = 0.62 [nm3 ] = 0.62\u00d710\u221227[m3 ].\nSupposing that particles are represented according expression\n\u221227\n(24) by their medium mass m1:1:1\n[kg], we obtain\npart = 2.77\u00d710\nfor the density of the Cluster the value\nDCluster = (22 \u00d7 m1:1:1\npart )/VCluster = 60.94/0.62\n= 98[kg.m\u22123],\n\n(40)\n\ni.e. a value approaching density values known from solid\nstate physics (i.e. values lying between the densities of gases\nand liquids).\nIn a similar way it is possible to calculate the density in an\nObject. In our model, according Table 3, the distance between\nClusters describing a part of the Object structure (corresponding\nthe wavelength \u03bb=1.9 [nm]) was dCluster =0.12 [m]. The skeleton\nsimulating the Object had an edge aObject =0.28 [m] and could be\nsurrounded by a sphere with a diameter R = 2dCluster = 0.24 [m]\nand a volume VObject = 0.058 [m3 ]. Using again the medium mass\n\u221227\n[kg]\nof particles according expression (24) m1:1:1\npart = 2.77\u00d710\nand taking in account that there are according expression (25)\n1:1:1\n= 2.35\u00d71010 particles in the Object, then the total mass in\nNpartO\nthe Object is 6.51\u00d710\u22127 [kg] and we obtain for the density of an\nObject the value\n1:1:1\nDObject = (NpartO\n\u00d7 m1:1:1\npart )/VObject\n\n13\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\n= (6.51 \u00d7 10\u22127 [kg])/0.058[m3],\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\n\nDObject = 2.24 \u00d7 10 [kg.m ],\n\ni.e.\n(41)\n\ni.e. a value of density by an order \u223c1018 greater than the\nvalue of the medium density of the matter D = 9\u00d710\u221223 [kg.m\u22123]\nas found from the RDF analysis (see Table 2). This is a reasonable result because there has to be a non zero value of density in\nthe inter-Object space.\nAt the same time we have to take in account that the estimates concerning the density of matter are really complicated. The microwave light seen by the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP), suggests that fully 72% of the matter density in the universe appears to be in the form of dark energy (Wheeler 2007) and 23% is dark matter. Only 4.6% is ordinary matter. So less than 1 part in 20 is made out of matter we\nhave observed experimentally or described in the standard model\nof particle physics. Of the other 96%, apart from the properties\njust mentioned, we know \"absolutely nothing\" (Smolin 2007)].\nIn this connection we consider the density value we have received (9\u00d710\u221223 [kg.m\u22123]) as the density of the ordinary matter.\nLast remark should be given to the probability of Object interactions in the case of their apparently large mutual distances\n(\u223c102 [m]). It follows from the Maxwell speed distribution that\nthe root mean square particle velocity \u03bd corresponding to the\ntemperature T = 3000 [K], is\nr\n3kT\n\u03bd=\n(42)\nm\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (k = 5.4\u00d710\u221223\n[Joule.K\u22121 ]) and m is the mass of the particle,\nwhich may be here the already mentioned mass of\nthe proton p (m = 1.67\u00d710\u221227 [kg]). Then we obtain\n\u03bdp\n=\n(3 \u00d7 1.38 \u00d7 10\u221223 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 103 )/(1.67 \u00d7 10\u221227 )\n=\n\u221220\n(12.42 \u00d7 10 /1.67 \u00d7 10\u221227 = 8.6\u00d7103 [m.s\u22121 ]. This is\nalready a velocity, which should make possible an intensive\ninteraction of Objects formed by Clusters consisting of particles.\n\n6. Conclusions\nA formalism of solid state physics has been applied to provide an\nadditional tool for the research of cosmological problems. It was\ndemonstrated how this new approach could be useful in the analysis of the CMB data. After a transformation of the anisotropy\nspectrum of relict radiation into a special two-fold reciprocal\nspace it was possible to propose a simple and general description of the interaction of relict photons with the matter 380.000\nyears after the Big-Bang by a \"relict radiation factor\". This factor, which may help in an improvement of the theoretical predictions of the CMB pattern, enabled us to process the transformed\nCMB anisotropy spectrum by a Fourier transform and thus arrive to a radial electron density distribution function (RDF) in a\nreciprocal space.\nAs a consequence it was possible to estimate distances between Objects of the order of \u223c100 [m] and the density of the\nordinary matter \u223c10\u221222 [kg.m\u22123 ]. Another analysis based on a\ndirect calculation of the CMB radiation spectrum after its transformation into a simple reciprocal space and combined with appropriate structure modelling confirmed the cluster structure. It\nindicated that the internal structure of Objects may be formed\nby Clusters distant \u223c10 [cm], whereas the internal structure of a\nCluster consisted of particles distant \u223c0.3 [nm].\nIn this way the work points quite unequivocally to clustering\nprocesses and to a cluster-like structure of the matter and thus\n14\n\ncontributes to the understanding of the structure of density fluctuations and simultaneously sheds more light on the structure\nof the universe in the moment when the universe became transparent for photons. Clustering may be at the same time a new\nphysical effect which has not been taken fully into consideration\nin the past. On the basis of our quantitative considerations it was\npossible to derive the number of particles (protons, helium nuclei, electrons and other particles) in Objects and Clusters and\nthe number of Clusters in an Object.\nAcknowledgements.

The factor 10\u221221 in\nequation (A.3) is a consequence of the fact that the parameter r\nis in [nm].\nThe parameter s is in equation (A.2) related with the wavelength of scattered radiation \u03bb by the formula\nsin \u03b8\n\u03bb\n\n(A.5)\n\nHere is s = s \u2212 s0 , where s0 is the vector of the incident and\ns the vector of the scattered radiation in the reciprocal space.\nFurther, \u03b8 is the angle between the incident and scattered radiation (X-rays or neutrons) and \u03bb is the wavelength of this radiation and Km is the effective number of electrons in an atom of\nkind m\nKm = fm / fe\n\nsmax\nClassic =\n\n4\u03c0\n= 176.819[nm\u22121 ]\n\u03bbMo\nClassic\n\n(A.8)\n\nHere we are starting to use the subscript \"Classic\", which\nshould point out that the scattering vector in the reciprocal space\nsClassic will be considered in the same way as in the \"classic\"\nconventional non-crystalline case.\nIn equation (A.2) is i(s) the experimentally obtained scattered intensity of radiation, Icorr is this intensity corrected for\nvarious factors 3 and properly scaled for the absolute value of\nscattering, hence\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni(s) = Idistr = Icorr (s) \u2212 Igas (s) / fe2 ,\n(A.9)\nthe parameter fe2 is acting here as a sharpening function.\nThe general formula for the scattering on gas Igas (s) is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ecX\n\uf8f7\n2\nincoh \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nIgas (s) = \uf8ec\uf8ed am fm +\nam fm \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\n(A.10)\nm\n\nm\n\nwhere fmincoh are the scattering factors for the incoherent\n(Compton) scattering, see Fig. 7.\nThe labelling Idistr for i(s) will be used in the Appendix B,\nwhere the scaling methods, important for a correct Fourier transform, are discussed.\n\nAppendix B: The scaling problem\n(A.3)\n\nwhere Zm is the atomic number of kind m, D is the macroscopic density in [g.cm\u22123] and M is the molecular weight\nX\nM=\nam Wm\n(A.4)\n\ns = 4\u03c0\n\nDuring a conventional experiment (e.g. see Fig. 2), i.e. using\nMoK\u03b1 radiation, we have \u03bbMo\nClassic = 0.071069 [nm] and the max\u25e6\nimum possible value of smax\nClassic , corresponding to \u03b8 = 90 is then\naccording equation (A.5)\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhere fm is the atomic scattering factor for X-rays for an\natom of the kind m (see already Sect. 2.1.1.) and and fe is the\natomic scattering power of an electron for X-rays\nP\nam fm\nfe = P m\n(A.7)\nm am Zm\n\nIn equation (A.9) we have already introduced the quantity Icorr (s), i.e. the corrected experimental scattered intensity.\nHowever, in order to arrive to a correct RDF, Icorr (s) must be\nscaled to the Igas (s) function in the absolute scale of atomic scattering, see equation (A.10).\nIn the simplest scaling method we suppose that for high svalues (HSV) there are not any scattering effects on the corrected experimental curve Icorr (s) and therefore the Icorr (s) and\nthe Igas (s) curves should be equal. Then the scaling parameter\naHSV is for s \u2192 smax easily calculated as\naHSV =\n\nIgas (s)\nIcorr (s)\n\n(B.1)\n\nAs a consequence we obtain in the whole interval of s-values\nHSV\na scaled scattered intensity Inorm\n(s) represented by the equation\nHSV\nInorm\n(s) = aHSV Icorr (s)\n\n(B.2)\n\nHSV\nThe function Inorm\n(s) oscillates around the Igas (s) curve.\nFollowing equation (A.9), we subtract the scattering on gas and\nobtain the most important function Idistr , see Fig. 6.\nThere are several other scaling methods. An integral method\naccording to Hultgren et al. (1935) is characterized by a scaling\nfactor aHGW and supposes that the areas under the experimental\nscattering curve Icorr (s) and the structureless Igas (s) curve should\n3\nIn a conventional experiment the scattered intensity is corrected for\nscattering on \"air\", absorption, divergency of the X-ray beam, Lorentz\nand polarization factor. During our calculations we have included only\nthe polarization factor.\n\n15\n\n\fL. \u010cervinka: Transformation of CMB radiation into reciprocal spaces\n\nbe equal. Similarly there is a quadratic integral method according to Krog Moe (1956) characterized by a scaling parameter\naKRM .\nOur long experience in the research of disordered materials documents that the better was the experiment and the better\nhas been the application of scattering factors, the smaller was the\ndifference (only several percent) between the scaling coefficients\naHSV , aHGW and aKRM and the smaller were the parasitic fluctuations on the RDF. In the present work we have used all three\nscaling methods and have kept the difference between scaling\nfactors in the limit of 4 percent.\n\n16\n\n\f"}
