This is analogous to a hydrodynamic description of a\nsystem of microscopic particles satisfying classical mechanics. Some progress has been made in this\nregard in recent years, including constructing a long wavelength, long time theory of the KuramotoSivashinsky (KS) equation [4]. In this reference, the authors obtained an effective stochastic equation\nwhich belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) university class in the hydrodynamic limit. This\nwas obtained by incorporating the chaotic dynamics of the small KS system in a coarse-graining\nprocedure. The basic premise of their approach is that the spatiotemporal chaos of a large system can\nbe understood in terms of the chaos observed in mutually coupled, small systems. Two other recent\nstudies [5, 6] of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation used a wavelet decomposition to characterize\nits spatiotemporal chaos. The first investigation led to results similar to those of reference [4],\nsuggesting a statistical description of a group of identical short length subsystems, slowly driven via\ninteractions with the larger scales. More precisely, in [5] it was shown that an effective equation\ncould be obtained and consistently approximated by a forced Burgers equation, for scales far from\nthe cutoff between small and large wavelengths. This work was extended in [6] where the authors\nfound that projecting onto a spline wavelet basis enabled a good separation of length scales, with\neach having its own characteristic dynamics. At large scales they found essentially slow Gaussian\ndynamics, which can be understood in terms of local events. The results are also consistent with\nthe picture of weakly interacting small subsystems and so-called \"extensive chaos\" (in which the\nLyapunov dimension is proportional to Ld , where L is the linear system size and d the dimension\nof space). The authors also discussed various correlation lengths and demonstrated the existence of\na spatial interaction length, which provides a limit on how much one may limit spatial interactions\nwithout changing the dynamics significantly (and hence limits how small a system one can use).\n\nMotivated by the success of the wavelet decomposition of the KS model, we have undertaken\nsuch a decomposition for another one dimensional model, the so-called Nikolaevskii equation [7, 8, 9].\nThis model was originally proposed to describe the propagation of longitudinal seismic waves. It\nwas subsequently shown to exhibit a direct transition from a spatially uniform, stationary state to\na spatiotemporally chaotic state as a control parameter was varied [9]. The spatiotemporal chaotic\nbehavior of this system (which has been named as soft mode turbulence or SMT) is different from\nthat of the KS equation as a result of the existence of an additional continuous symmetry in the\nmodel (beyond the conventional symmetries of space and time translation invariance). This model\nis particularly interesting in that there are two control parameters, \u01eb and the system size L, such\n2\n\n\fthat one can study the transition to chaos as a function of \u01eb in terms of power law behavior, scaling,\netc. In this sense it is a richer model than the KS equation and many results have been obtained for\nit, including a calculation of the Lyapunov exponents, Lyapunov dimension and Kolmogorov-Sinai\nentropy for several values of \u01eb in the limit of large L such that extensive chaos holds [10]. It has also\nbeen shown that the distribution function for the order parameter is Gaussian for large wavelengths\nand large times. In this paper we carry out a wavelet decomposition similar to that in reference\n[6], using a Daubechies basis. We find that the most energetic modes have a Gaussian distribution\nfor this choice of basis. We also calculate the Lyapunov spectrum and find that one can remove a\ncertain set of the modes without altering this spectrum, suggesting that in this sense one can obtain\na more minimal description of spatiotemporal chaos for this model.\n\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: in section II we define the model and the wavelet decomposition scheme. In section III we present the main results of our analysis. This includes a calculation\nof the energy distribution (power spectrum) and the probability density functions for the wavelet\ncoefficients. It also includes a calculation of the effects on the Lyapunov spectrum resulting from\nremoving various modes from the dynamics. In section IV we present briefly the conclusions of this\nwork.\n\n2\n\nModel and Wavelet Decomposition\n\nThe Nikolaevskii model is defined by the partial differential equation\n\u2202v\n\u22022\n\u2202v\n\u22022\n+ 2 [\u01eb \u2212 (1 + 2 )2 ]v + v\n=0\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(1)\n\nwith 0 \u2264 x \u2264 L and periodic boundary conditions, where \u01eb and L are two control parameters for\nthe model. In the present paper we study the model for \u01eb = 0.5 and L \u2248 158; these values are large\nenough to see well developed STC[10].\nThe general form of a discrete wavelet decomposition for a field v(x, t) can be written as\nXX\nv(x, t) =\najk (t)\u03a8jk (x)\nj\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nwhere the set \u03a8jk (x) = 2j/2 \u03a8(2j x \u2212 k) form an orthogonal basis in the sense that\nZ \u221e\nh\u03a8jk | \u03a8j \u2032 k\u2032 i \u2261\n\u03a8jk (x)\u03a8j \u2032 k\u2032 (x)dx = \u03b4j,j \u2032 \u03b4k,k\u2032\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe indices j, k are integers which we specify below. The function \u03a8(x) is called the wavelet function\n(or \"mother\" function) and the wavelet coefficients can be obtained as\nZ \u221e\najk (t) = hv | \u03a8jk i =\nv(x, t)\u03a8jk (x)dx.\n\u2212\u221e\n\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fOne obtains equations of motion for the wavelet coefficients by substituting Eq.(2) into Eq.(1).\nThose equations of motion can then be numerically solved in order to obtain the time evolution of the\nwavelet coefficients and, hence, information about the chaotic behavior of the model. Alternatively,\none can solve directly Eq.(1) and use Eq.(4) to obtain the wavelet coefficients. This latter approach\nis the one we follow in this paper: at the required times we decompose the resulting solution for\nv(x, t) in terms of the Daub4 orthogonal basis set. The Daub4 is the simplest of a wavelet family\nnamed DaubK constructed by Daubechies [11] where K ranges from 4 to 20. Based on this wavelet\nfamily a very effective algorithm has been developed [12]. Thus by this method we obtain the time\ndependence of the wavelet coefficients ajk (t).\n\nThe Nikolaevskii equation (1) is integrated numerically using a version of the pseudo-spectral\nmethod combined with a fourth-order predictor-corrector integrator. (The details of this method\nwill be given elsewhere). We use a mesh size \u03b4x = 0.31 and a time step \u03b4t = 0.01 in the numerical\nscheme. The length L of the system is L = N \u03b4x, where N is the total number of points of the\nsystem. It is convenient to choose N = 2J+1 (J is an integer which represents the largest level\nof the wavelet) in order to apply Daub4 in an efficient pyramidal scheme. In our case we usually\nchoose J = 8 so N = 512 and L = 158.72. The total integration time in our simulation goes from\nt = 600, 000 to t = 1, 100, 000 (in the dimensionless units of equation (1)), depending on which\nquantity we calculate. Usually, once we have reached the chaotic state, we perform time averages of\nthe quantities of interest.\n\nThe wavelet decomposition using Daub4 is carried out in a pyramidal scheme such that at level\nj there is a total of 2j coefficients: ajk (t) with k = 1, . . . , 2j and j = 0, . . . , J, except for the coarsest\nlevel j = 0 where there are 2 coefficients, namely a00 (t) and a01 (t), instead of just one. To be more\nprecise in the notation, we define the wavelet contribution at level j as\nvj (x, t) =\n\nX\n\najk (t)\u03a8jk (x),\n\n(5)\n\nk\n\nsuch that the field is a sum of all its wavelet contributions, v(x, t) =\n\nP\n\nj\n\nvj (x, t). Notice that as the\n\nwavelet level becomes coarser, i.e reducing j by one, the number of wavelet coefficients contributing\nto vj (x, t) is therefore reduced by a factor of two and that the total number of wavelet coefficients\najk (t) equals the number of points in the system, N = 2J+1 .\n\n3\n\nWavelet Analysis: Results\n\n4\n\n\f3.1\n\nEnergy Distribution\n\nIn the language of signal processing, the total energy of a signal field is a conserved quantity. For\nour case, the energy for the chaotic field v(x, t) can be defined as\nZ L\n\u22121\n\u22121\nE(t) = L hv | vi = L\nv 2 (x, t)dx\n0\n\nand it can be written as the sum of the energies at each wavelet level, E(t) =\nej (t) = L\n\n\u22121\n\n(6)\nP\n\nj\n\nej (t) with\n\nhvj | vj i. Fig. (1a) shows the energy distribution per wavelet level for the Nikolaevskii\n\nmodel, averaged over time. One sees that the energy of the field is mainly concentrated at wavelet\nlevel j = 5. As a comparison, we also show the structure factor S(q), which can be thought of\nas the energy distribution in Fourier space, in Fig. (1b). It is easy to show for this model [8]\nthat the unstable modes (within linear stability analysis) in Fourier space are located between\n\u221a\nq1,2 = (1 \u00b1 \u01eb)1/2 , with the most unstable mode at qm \u2243 1.0, consistent with the results shown in\nFig. 1(b). In our case with \u01eb = 0.5 it is q1 \u2243 0.54 and q2 \u2243 1.31, so with L = 158.72, the most\nenergetic mode should be at nm = qm L/2\u03c0 \u2243 25.26 and the smallest and largest unstable modes are\nat n1 = q1 L/2\u03c0 \u2243 13.67 and n2 = q2 /2\u03c0 \u2243 33.00 respectively. Therefore there should be about 20\ncomplex or 40 real unstable or marginal modes concentrated in the neighborhood of the 50th real\nmode. Notice that wavelet levels 0 \u2212 4 contain a total of 32 modes (corresponding to 32 wavelet\ncoefficients). It is easy to understand, therefore, that the energy peak is located at wavelet level\nj = 5. On the other hand, if one compares Figures (1a) and (1b), we can also see that for small\nq there is no similarity between the two energy distributions, implying that for small q the overlap\nbetween different wavelet levels is relatively strong.\n\n3.2\n\nTemporal Behavior and Probability Distribution of Wavelet Coefficients\n\nFigure 2 shows the temporal behavior of some wavelet coeffients ajk (t). At each level j we show the\nintermediate wavelet coefficient with k = 2j\u22121 . Notice that, from the very early times, there is a\nchaotic behavior in the temporal evolution. In Fig. 3 we show the probability density\n\nfunctions (PDFs) for the wavelet coefficients from level j = 1 to j = 7, averaged over time.\nNamely, for fixed j we sum over all k for the ajk coefficients to obtain a mean value; we repeat this\nover all times sampled and plot these mean values to obtain the PDF. The PDFs for j = 0 and j = 8\nare not shown here, since they are just Dirac-delta functions with spikes at zero. The delta functionlike behavior at the largest wavelet level j = 8 simply means that there is a strong dissipation at\n5\n\n\flarge wavenumbers in the Fourier spectrum (cf Wittenberg and Holmes [6]). (In Fig. 3 we can\nalready see a similar behavior developing at the level j = 7.) The spike at j = 0, however, only\nimplies that the coarsest part is not suitable for describing the field and its two components compete\nwith each other everywhere to yield a zero average value for the amplitude. We have tried to fit\nthese PDFs to a Gaussian distribution. In Fig. 3 we see that for j = 1, ..., 7 the PDFS are essentially\nGaussian. (We do not think the small deviations from Gaussian are statistically significant.)\n\nThe wavelet decomposition of the STC in this model allows us to examine the chaotic behavior\nof the system at different spatial scales. In general, as can be seen somewhat in Fig. 1a), the large\nj levels correspond to large wavenumbers or small spatial scales and the small j levels correspond\nto small wavenumbers or large spatial scales. In this section we try to confirm this in more detail\nby showing the structure factors which result from removing various wavelet levels.\n\nIn Fig.(4a-f) we show the structure factor for some of these \"reduced level\" systems, with the\nfull structure factor for the Nikolaevskii model shown for comparison. Fig. (4a) shows the result\nof removing wavelet level j = 8, for which the new structure factor is almost identical with the\nexact one. This shows that removing the smallest spatial scale in the wavelets (or, equivalently,\nthe shortest wavelengths) leaves the system invariant. Fig. (4b) shows the result of removing levels\nj = 7 and j = 8. In this case, there is a small difference between the two structure factors for\nlarge wavenumbers, indicating that the large j levels of the wavelets only contribute to the shortwavelength dynamics (i.e. the fast dissipation) of the model. Fig. (4c) shows the result of removing\nlevels j = 6, 7 and 8. In this case there is a significant difference between the two structure factors\nnear the peak. This is not surprising since j = 6 is the second most energetic level in the model. Fig.\n(4d) shows the results of removing levels j = 0, 1 and 2. The resulting structure factors shows that\nthese levels are responsible for the small peak in the structure factor near wavenumber q \u2248 0. Fig.\n(4e) shows the role of the most energetic levels in the model, i.e. j = 4, 5 and 6. We see that these\nlevels are responsible for the dominant part of the structure factor. Furthermore, we also see that\nwithout level j = 3, the small peak near q \u2248 0 becomes even smaller in comparison with Fig.(4d).\nFinally, Fig. (4f) shows the result of removing all levels with j > 2. As one would expect, one only\nhas the peak near small q. If one considers all of the above results, one obtains a clear picture of\nthe scale localization involved in the wavelet decomposition.\n\nWe end this section with a discussion of the relationship between wavelet decomposition and\nthe renormalization group transformation. It is clear that removing the large-j wavelet levels is a\nprocedure that essentially removes the short-wavelength part of the structure factor in Fourier space.\nIn this sense it is like a renormalization group transformation in which one integrates out the short\n\n6\n\n\fwavelength degrees of freedom to obtain a renormalized description of a system. The particular\nDaub4 algorithm we use here is a kind of decimation transformation in that at every step removing\na wavelet of the largest remaining level means that one has only half as many spatial points as before\nthe removal to describe the (chaotic) field. The other set of values of the field is \"filtered out\", with\nthe value of the field at a given new (remaining) space point being a kind of average of the field at\nfour of the neighboring points of the original set. Other types of wavelet decompositions correspond\nto different kinds of transformations.\n\n3.3\n\nLyapunov Spectrum\n\nWe conclude by examining the effect of removing wavelet levels on the Lyapunov spectrum of the\nsystem. This provides us with the most detailed understanding of the contribution of various levels\nto the chaotic dynamics of the system. Fig. (5a) shows the Lyapunov spectrum obtained after\nremoving the j = 8 level, while Fig. (5b) shows the Lyapunov spectrum obtained after removing\nj = 7 and j = 8. The Lyapunov spectrum for the Nikolaevskii model is also shown for comparison.\nIn Table 1 we show the Lyapunov dimension D and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy H for these\ndifferent cases. It seems that to a very good approximation the chaotic behavior of the system\ndoes not depend on the j = 8 level. Thus a simplified statistical description of the Nikolaevskii\nequation can be obtained by excluding the j = 8 level, without altering the chaotic dynamics for\nthe system. However, it is also clear from inspection of Table 1 that removing any additional levels\nsignificantly alters the behavior. Thus all these levels play an important role in the spatiotemporal\nchaotic dynamics of the system.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that the dynamics of the one dimensional Nikolaevskii equation in the spatiotemporally chaotic regime may be understood in terms of localized dynamics in both space and scale\n(wavenumber). Specifically, a projection onto a particular Daubechies basis (Daub4) yields a good\nseparation of scales, as shown by an examination of the contribution of different wavelet levels to\nthe power spectrum. At most scales, including the most energetic ones, we find essentially Gaussian\ndynamics. Perhaps most importantly, we also found that removal of certain wavelet modes can be\nmade without altering the chaotic dynamics of the system as described by the Lyapunov spectrum.\n\n7\n\n\fMany different length scales have been proposed for the description of spatiotemporal chaos [2].\nThese include the usual correlation length \u03be2 for the (two point) order parameter and the dimension\ncorrelation length \u03be\u03b4 , obtained from the Lyapunov dimension D(L) as \u03be\u03b4 = limL\u2192\u221e Ld /D(L). Here d\ndenotes the space dimensionality and L the linear dimension of the system. We have studied both of\nthese lengths as a function of the control parameter \u01eb for this model. The results of these calculations,\nas well as for other quantities characterizing the spatiotemporal chaos will be presented elsewhere\n[13]. Since it is difficult to calculate the Lyapunov dimension for high-dimensional systems, Zoldi\nand Greenside have proposed using a Karhunen-Loeve dimension DKLD , defined by the number\nof eigenmodes in a proper orthogonal decomposition necessary to capture a given fraction f of\nthe total energy. From this dimension one can define a Karhunen-Loeve correlation length \u03beKLD .\nHowever, for a translationally invariant system, such as the Nikolaevskii equation with periodic\nboundary conditions, the Karhunen-Loeve eigenmodes are Fourier modes. Thus the KarhunenLoeve dimension length for any f can be computed directly from the power spectrum S(q) and thus\ncontains no more dynamical information than \u03be2 . As Wittenberg and Holmes have pointed out [6] all\nthese lengths (with the possible exception of the dimension correlation length \u03be\u03b4 ) are measures only\nof spatial disorder and thus yield no information about the temporally chaotic dynamics responsible\nfor the disorder. As a consequence, Wittenberg and Holmes introduced another length scale, a socalled dynamical interaction length. This is a length scale lc such that if one deletes interactions for\nlength scales greater than lc in the wavelet Galerkin projection of the model equation of interest,\none alters the chaotic dynamics of the model (i.e. changes the Lyapunov spectrum). Although this\nis in principle a very interesting length scale to study, it involves a numerical calculation which for\nour model is computationally expensive and beyond our current resources. As a consequence, we\nleave this important issue for future investigation.\n\nFinally, as mentioned in the introduction, Wittenberg and Holmes [6] performed a wavelet decomposition of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model, using an orthogonal spline basis. They found that\nthe probability distribution functions for the most energetic modes were non-Gaussian. This differs\nfrom our results for the Nikolaevskii model, in which the distribution functions for the most energetic modes are Gaussian (to a very good approximation and excluding the peak near zero). To see\nwhether this difference is significant or simply results from a different choice of basis functions in\nthe two studies, we have calculated the PDFs for the KS model using the Daub4 basis. We found\nthat with this choice of basis the PDFs for the most energetic modes are in fact Gaussian. We\nfind non-Gaussian behavior only at the small-j levels. Thus it would seem that any non-Gaussian\nbehavior of the wavelet coefficients depends on the basis chosen for the wavelet decomposition.\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by NSF grant DRM9813409 and DGES (Spain)\n\n8\n\n\fprojects PB97-0141-C02-01 and BMF2000-1108.
