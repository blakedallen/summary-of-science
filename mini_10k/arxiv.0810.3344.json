In this theory the particles are seen as different oscillations modes of the strings\nand it was able to describe some spectral characteristics of hadrons. Although this success, the original string theory\nis not able to explain many physical phenomenon mediated by strong interactions and nowadays the most successful\ntheory to describe particle physics is the Quantum Cromodynamics (QCD). On the other hand, despite string theory\nhas reemerged in the last three decades as a promising candidate for a quantum theory of all known interactions, its\nvalidity to describe nature has generated heated discussions since the theory is untestable due to the experimental\nimpossibility to reach the tremendous energies found at the Plank scale. So, what is the actual relevance of string\ntheory for real world physics? Either string theory is the correct theory to describe the world or not, remarkable\nresulties showed that string theory can be seen as a different formalism to quantum field theory. In QCD, it is not\n\n\u2217\n\nlazo@smail.ufsm.br\n\n\f2\npossible to obtain a satisfactory quantitative description in the small energy regime, when the coupling constant is\nvery strong. In this regime, numerical calculation on the lattice is the best tool for study physical models. On the\nother hand, it was observed by 't Hooft [1] that the theory is simplified when the number N of colors is very high.\n't Hooft derived a relationship between the topological structure of a Feynman graph and its N dependence. When\n1/N is interpreted as a coupling constant, an expansion in 1/N is similar to an expansion in a generic interacting\nstring theory, resulting in a relation between strings and planar diagrams. If the N = 3 can be regarded as a large N ,\nit explain why the string models of 60's years was able to give the right relation for some spectral characteristics of\nhadrons. More recently a remarkable result arouses new interest in the duality between string theory and quantum\nfield theory. Maldacena conjectured that IIB string theory on the curved background AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 (anti-de Sitter and\nsphere spaces) should be equivalent to N = 4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) [3, 4, 5]. This conjecture, AdS/CFT, relates\noperators, states, correlation functions and dynamics of both theories. One of the most important results of this\nconjecture predicts that the spectrum of scaling dimension operator of gauge invariant operators, in the conformal\nfield theory, should coincide with the spectrum of energies E of string states. Furthermore, this correspondence relates\nthe weak coupling constant regime, in the gauge theory, with the strong coupling constant ones, in the string theory.\nThe Maldacena' s conjecture need yet to be fully proved and since the discovery of the relation between the\nplanar dilatation operator of the N = 4 SYM with an integrable so(6) quantum spin chains [2], integrability has\nplayed a prominent role in the exploration of the Maldacena's correspondence. The study of the planar dilatation\noperator's integrability is very important because it not only enable us to test the Maldacena's correspondence as\nit is an generator of nontrivial integrable models. Exactly solvable models are of interest in high energy physics,\ncondensed matter physics, statistical mechanics and mathematics since the pioneering work of Hans Bethe [6] (see,\ne.g., [7, 8, 9, 10] for reviews). According to this ansatz the amplitudes of the eigenfunction are expressed by a\nnonlinear combination of properly defined plane waves. On the other hand, in the last two decades several different\nansatz were introduced in the literature under the general name of matrix product ansatz (MPA). The first formulation\nwas done for the description of the ground-state eigenfunction of some special non-integrable quantum chains, the so\ncalled valence-bond solid models [11, 12, 13, 14]. The MPA becomes also a successful tool for the exact calculation\nof the stationary probability distribution of some stochastic one dimensional systems [15, 16, 17]. An extension of\nthis last MPA, called dynamical MPA was introduced in [18, 19] and extended in [20]. This last ansatz gives the\ntime-dependent probability distribution for some exact integrable systems. The MPA we are going to use in this\n\n\f3\npaper was introduced in [21, 22, 23, 24]. This ansatz was applied with success in the evaluation of the spectra of\nseveral integrable quantum Hamiltonians [21, 22, 23], transfer matrices [25, 26, 27] and the time-evolution operator of\nstochastic systems [24]. According to this ansatz, the amplitudes of the eigenfunctions are given in terms of a product\nof matrices where the matrices obey appropriated algebraic relations. In the case of the Bethe ansatz the spectral\nparameters and the amplitudes of the plane waves are fixed, apart from a normalization constant, by the eigenvalue\nequation of the Hamiltonian or transfer matrix. On the other hand, in the MPA the eigenvalue equation fixes the\ncommutation relations of the matrices defining the ansatz. In such case the spectrum of the Hamiltonian or transfer\nmatrix, and the corresponding eigenfunctions, can be computed in a purely algebraic way.\nIn the present paper we obtain through a MPA the exact solution of the most general inhomogeneous spin chain with\nnearest neighbor interaction and with U (1)2 and U (1)3 symmetries. This model is related to the one loop dilatation\noperator in deformed Lunin-Maldacena backgrounds [28] and conformal field theories with deformations [29]. The\nsolutions presented here generalizes the results obtained for homogeneous spins chains with U (1)N symmetries in the\nsectors of N = 2 and N = 3 [30, 31]. In this model the coupling interaction between neighbor sites are not a constant\nas it is in the homogeneous model studied in [30, 31].\n\nTHE INHOMOGENEOUS SPIN CHAINS\n\nWe consider here the most general inhomogeneous 3-state spin chain with nearest neighbor interaction, periodic\nboundary condition and U (1)3 symmetry. The U (1)3 symmetry imply that the Hamiltonian describing the time\nevolution of this spin chain conserves the number of states of each type. By denoting the basis of states at a given\nsite as |\u03b1i (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3), the Hamiltonian in a periodic lattice with L sites takes the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nL\n3\n3\nX\nX\nX\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\uf8ed\nH=\n\u0393\u03b2 \u03b1 (j, j + 1)Ej Ej+1 +\n\u0393\u03b1 \u03b2 (j, j + 1)Ej\u03b1 \u03b1 Ej+1 \uf8f8 ,\nj=1\n\n\u03b16=\u03b2=1\n\nwhere E \u03b1 \u03b2 are 3 \u00d7 3 Wyel matrices with elements E \u03b1 \u03b2\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=1\n\n\u0001\ni,j\n\n= \u03b4\u03b1,i \u03b4\u03b2,j (\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3). While the first term in\n\nthe right hand side of (1) acts over neighbor sites exchanging its configuration |\u03b1ij \u2297 |\u03b2ij+1 \u2192 |\u03b2ij \u2297 |\u03b1ij+1 with\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\nrate \u0393\u03b1\n\u03b2 \u03b1 (j, j + 1), the second one is a diagonal operator with weight \u0393\u03b1 \u03b2 (j, j + 1). The Hamiltonian (1) in a\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\nparticular case (\u0393\u03b1\n\u03b3 \u03b4 (j, j + 1) = \u0393\u03b3 \u03b4 constant) contain the homogeneous integrable spin-1 chain, related to the one\n\nloop dilatation operator in deformed Lunin-Maldacena backgrounds, studied by Freyhult, Kristjansen and Mansson\n\n\f4\n[31] and generalized in [30]. The eigenfunctions for (1) can be construct as\n\u2217\nX\n\n|\u03a8L i =\n\n\u03a8\u03b11 ...\u03b1L |\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1L i (\u03b1j = 1, 2, 3),\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1L\n\nwhere the symbol (\u2217) in the sum denotes the restriction to the sets {\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1L } with the same number n\u03b1 of spins in\nconfiguration \u03b1 and \u03a8\u03b11 ...\u03b1L is a constant.\n\nTHE MPA\n\nIn order to formulate a MPA for the Hamiltonian (1), we make a one-to-one correspondence between configurations\nof spins and products of abstract matrices. This matrix product is construct by making a correspondence between a\n(\u03b1)\n\nsite j in the chain with spin configuration \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 and a matrix Aj . Our MPA asserts that the components of the\n(\u03b1)\n\namplitude of the eigenfunction \u03a8\u03b11 ...\u03b1L in (2) are obtained by associating them to a products of these matrices Aj .\n(\u03b1)\n\nActually Aj\n\nare abstract operators with an associative product. A well defined eigenfunction is obtained, apart\n\nfrom a normalization factor, if all the amplitudes are related uniquely. Equivalently, in the subset of words (products\n(\u03b1)\n\nof matrices) in the algebra containing n\u03b1 (n1 + n2 + n3 = L) matrices Aj\n\nthere exists only a single independent\n\nword. The relation between any two words gives the ratio between the corresponding amplitudes of the components\nof the eigenfunction |\u03a8L i. To formulated the ansatz we can choose any uniform operation on the matrix products\nthat gives a non-zero scalar to make a map between the amplitudes \u03a8\u03b11 ...\u03b1L in (2) and a matrix product [38]:\n(\u03b11 )\n\n\u03a8\u03b11 ...\u03b1L \u21d0\u21d2 A1\n\n(\u03b12 )\n\nA2\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\n* * * AL L\n\n(\u03b1j = 1, 2, 3).\n\n(3)\n\nIt is obvious that the 3 states |\u03b1...\u03b1i (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3) are all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (1). In the following we\nshall choose |1...1i as our reference state. The Hamiltonian (1) when applied to the components of the eigenfunction\n(2) where we do not have spins configurations |\u03b1i (\u03b1 = 2, 3) at nearest neighbor sites and at boundary positions give\nus the constraints, for the amplitudes \u03a8\u03b11 ...\u03b1L (3),\nx2 \u2212x1 \u22121\nxj+1 \u2212xj \u22121 (\u03b1j+1 )\nL\u2212xn\n1)\nj\u22121 )\nj)\nn)\n\u03b5n Ax1 \u22121 A(\u03b1\n* * * Ax(\u03b1j\u22121\nAxj \u2212xj\u22121 \u22121 A(\u03b1\nAxj+1 * * * A(\u03b1\nx1 A\nxj A\nxn A\n\n=\n\nn h\nX\n\u03b1 1\nx2 \u2212x1 \u22121\nxj \u2212xj\u22121 \u22122 (\u03b1j )\n(\u03b1n ) L\u2212xn\n1)\nj\u22121 )\nj+1 )\n\u03931 j \u03b1j (j, j + 1)Ax1 \u22121 A(\u03b1\n* * * A(\u03b1\nAxj \u22121 Axj+1 \u2212xj A(\u03b1\nx1 A\nxj\u22121 A\nxj+1 * * * Axn A\nj=1\n1 \u03b1\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nj\nx1 \u22121 (\u03b11 ) x2 \u2212x1 \u22121\nxj \u2212xj\u22121\nL\u2212xn\nj\u22121 )\nj+1 )\nn)\n+ \u0393\u03b1j+1j+1\nAx 1 A\n* * * A(\u03b1\nAxj +1\nAxj+1 \u2212xj \u22122 Ax(\u03b1j+1\n* * * A(\u03b1\nxj\u22121 A\nxn A\n1 (j, j + 1)A\n\n+\n\nL h\ni\nX\n1 \u03b1l+1\nx1 \u22121 (\u03b11 ) x2 \u2212x1 \u22121\nL\u2212xn\nl 1\nn)\n\u0393\u03b1\nAx 1 A\n* * * A(\u03b1\nxn A\n\u03b1l 1 (l, l + 1) + \u03931 \u03b1l+1 (l, l + 1) A\nl=1\n\n(\u03b1j = 1, 2, 3),\n\ni\n\n(4)\n\n\f5\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5n is the energy of the eigenfunction (2), A \u2261 Ax , n = n2 + n3 , and x1 , ..., xn are the position in the spin chain\nwhere we have a state configuration |\u03b1 6= 1i. A convenient solution of this last equation is obtained by identifying\n(\u03b1)\n\nthe matrices Ax\n\n(\u03b1 = 2, 3) as composed by spectral-parameter-dependent matrices. The distinguibility of states\n(\u03b1)\n\nconfigurations allows two types of solutions. The standard solution is obtained if each of the matrices Ax\n\n(\u03b1 = 2, 3)\n\nis composed of n = n2 + n3 spectral parameter dependent matrices [22, 24, 30].

Since the several components of the wavefunction should be uniquely related, the above algebra should\nbe associative. This associativity implies that the above S-matrix should satisfy the Yang-Baxter relations [7, 32],\nwhich is indeed the case [30]. The components of the wavefunction corresponding to the configurations where we have\nthree or four particles in next-neigbouring sites would give in principle new relations involving three or four matrices\n(\u03b1)\n\nAx,kj . These new relations are however consequences of the above relations (6) and (12). It is important to mention\nthat in the sector n2 = 0 or n3 = 0 (symmetry U (1)2 ) the Hamiltonian (1) reduces to a inhomogeneous version of the\nwell known asymmetric XXZ model [33].\nIn order to complete our solutions through the MPA (3) we should fix the spectral parameters, or momenta,\nk1 , . . . , kn . Theses parameter are fixed from the configurations where we have a spin configuration \u03b1 = 2, 3 at\nboundary positions (x1 = 1 or xn = L).

The condition (17) leads to the problem of\nevaluation the eigenvalues of the inhomogeneous transfer matrix (15). This can be done through the algebraic Bethe\nansatz [34] or the coordinate Bethe ansatz (see [35] and [36] for example).\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe solve through a MPA the most general inhomogeneous 3-state spin chain with U (1)3 symmetry and nearest\nneighbor interaction. We found that the coupling constants in (1) should satisfy the constraints (8), (9) and (11) in\norder to make the Hamiltonian (1) integrable. It is important to mention that different from the homogeneous spin\nchain, where the eigenstates (2) are also eigenstates of the translation operator due to the periodic boundary condition,\nin the inhomogeneous model the eigenstates do not have a defined momentum. It happens due to the inhomogeneities\nthat broke the translational invariance of the system. The study of this new model can be of interest in the context\nof both AdS/CFT and condensed matter physics since it is related to the one loop dilatation operator in deformed\nLunin-Maldacena backgrounds [28], conformal field theories with deformations [29] and inhomogeneous spin chains.\nAnother quite interesting problem for the future concerns the formulation of the MPA for the case where we have\nopen boundary conditions, as well as for quantum chains with no global conservation law such as the XYZ model, the\n8-vertex model or the case where the quantum chains are defined on open lattices with non-diagonal boundary fields.\n\n\f8\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by CAPES (Brazilian agencies).\n\n[1] G.
