SERGEEV AND A.P. VESELOV\nAbstract. Various infinite-dimensional versions of Calogero\u2013Moser operator are discussed in relation with the theory of symmetric functions\nand representation theory of basic classical Lie superlagebras. This is a\nversion of invited talk given by the second author at XVI International\nCongress on Mathematical Physics in Prague, August 2009.\n\n1. Introduction\nCalogero\u2013Moser systems play truly exceptional role in the modern theory\nof integrable systems (see e.g. [1] for a variety of both mathematical and\ntheoretical physics problems they are related to). They have natural physical\ninterpretation, describing the interaction of N particles with equal masses\non the line with the inverse square potential or, in Sutherland's version, with\nthe inverse sin2 potential.\nThey admit natural generalizations related to root systems and simple Lie\nalgebras [2], and, at the quantum level only, also non-symmetric integrable\nversions called deformed Calogero-Moser systems [3], which turned out to be\nrelated to basic classical Lie superalgebras [4]. In particular, in the case of\nLie superalgebra sl(m, n) we have two groups of particles with two different\nmasses with the parameters of interaction inside the groups and between\nthem being \"tuned\" in a very special way (see [4]).\nIt turned out that these mysterious deformations can be clearly \"seen\nfrom infinity\". For this one should first explain what is the analogue of the\nCalogero\u2013Moser operators when N = \u221e. A proper framework is given by the\ntheory of symmetric functions and goes back to Stanley [5] and Macdonald\n[6], who were inspired by the work of H. Jack. It is interesting that Jack\ndid his work on what is now called Jack polynomials around 1970 - almost\nat the same time as the pioneering work by Calogero and Sutherland, but a\nclose relation between these two important developments was not recognized\nuntil much later.\nThe infinite-dimensional point of view also leads naturally to the notion of\nsuper Jacobi polynomials. Their specialized versions turned out to coincide\nwith suitable Euler supercharacters of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras\n[7, 8], which is one more evidence of the deep link between Calogero\u2013Moser\nsystems and representation theory.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA.N.

We have a natural homorphism \u03c6N : \u039b \u2192 \u039bN , sending pl to its N -dimensional analogue\nl . There is a problem with p = 1 + 1 + . . . , which in finitepl = z1l + * * * + zN\n0\ndimensional situation is just the dimension N , but in infinite dimension does\nnot make sense. The solution is to consider p0 as a formal additional parameter, which our operators may depend on. Under the homomorphism \u03c6N it\nmust be specialized to dimension N.\n(\u221e)\nAn infinite-dimensional analogue of CMS operator Lk,p0 : \u039b \u2192 \u039b is defined as the unique second order differential operator polynomially dependent on p0 , such that for all N = 1, 2, . . . and p0 = N the following diagram\nis commutative\n(\u221e)\n\nLk,p\n\n\u039b \u2212\u21920\n\u2193 \u03c6N\n\n\u039b\n\u2193 \u03c6N.\n\n(N)\n\n\u039bN\n\nLk\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u039bN\n\n(\u221e)\n\nThe operator Lk,p0 has the following explicit form in power sums (see [5, 9,\n10]):\nX\nX\nX\nX\n(\u221e)\nLk,p0 =\npa+b \u2202a \u2202b \u2212 k\npa \u2202a + (1 + k)\napa \u2202a ,\npa pb \u2202a+b \u2212 kp0\na,b>0\n\na,b>0\n\na>0\n\na>0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2202a =\n\na \u2202p\u2202 a .\n\n\fQUANTUM CALOGERO\u2013MOSER SYSTEMS: A VIEW FROM INFINITY\n\n3\n\nThis form reveals an important duality\n(\u221e)\n\n(\u221e)\n\n\u03b8 \u22121 \u25e6 Lk,p0 \u25e6 \u03b8 = kLk\u22121 ,k\u22121 p0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u03b8 : pa \u2192 kpa , k \u2192 k\u22121 .\nThere is also a remarkable symmetry between the first and the second terms,\nso that if following [9] we define \u2202 \u0303a = \u2212 ka \u2202p\u2202 a the operator is invariant under\nswapping pa and \u2202 \u0303a (Fourier duality).\nNote that \u03b8 changes the parameter p0 , which means that it does not\nwork in the finite dimensions. This fact was known already to Stanley and\nMacdonald, who probably were the first to discover this duality (see [5, 6]).\nThey have actually used a stable\nofPthe CMS operator by subtracting\nPversion\n\u2202\npa \u2202a with dimension dependent\nthe momentum operator P =\nzi \u2202zi =\ncoefficient (N \u2212 1). These stabilized CMS operators can be lifted to infinite\ndimension without introducing extra parameter p0 , which corresponds to the\nfact that p0 appears in (2) only as a coefficient at P , which is just another\nquantum integral of the system.\nHowever, already for the rational Calogero\u2013Moser operator\n(N )\n\nLk\n\n=\n\nN\nN\nX\nX\n2k(k + 1)\n\u22022\n\u2212\n2\n(xi \u2212 xj )2\n\u2202xi\ni<j\ni=1\n\nthe stabilization trick is not possible: its infinite-dimensional version has the\nform [10]\nX\nX\nX\n(\u221e)\npa+b\u22122 \u2202a \u2202b \u2212 k\npa pb \u2202a+b+2 + (1 + k)\n(a \u2212 1)pa\u22122 \u2202a .

For generic\nvalues of parameter k this algebra is generated by the deformed power sums\npa (u, v, k) =\n\nm\nX\n\nuai + k\u22121\n\nn\nX\n\nv\u03b1a , a = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n\u03b1=1\n\ni=1\n\nThe claim is that the BC(m, n) deformed CMS operators are the restrictions\nof BC\u221e CMS operator (6) onto the corresponding subvariety D(m, n, k) =\nSpec \u039bm,n,k . More precisely, let \u03c6m,n : \u039b \u2212\u2192 \u039bm,n,k be the restriction homomorphism defined by \u03c6m,n (pa ) = pa (u, v, k).\nTheorem 3.1 ([11]). The following diagram is commutative for h = \u2212km\u2212\nn \u2212 12 p \u2212 q and generic values of parameter k:\nL(k,p,q,h)\n\n\u039b\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2193 \u03c6m,n\n\u039bm,n,k\n\nL(m,n)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u039b\n\u2193 \u03c6m,n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n\u039bm,n,k\n\nwhere L(m,n) is a gauged version of the deformed CMS operator (8) rewritten\nin the coordinates ui = 2 sinh2 xi , vj = 2 sinh2 yj .\nA remarkable fact is that these are essentially all possible restrictions of\nBC\u221e CMS operator (see Theorem 4.6 in [11]), which shows the exceptional\nrole of the deformed CMS operators.\nThe eigenfunctions J\u03bb (x; k, p, q, h) of the BC\u221e operator (6) are labelled\nby partitions \u03bb and known as Jacobi symmetric functions. Their images\nSJ\u03bb (u, v; k, p, q) = \u03c6m,n (J\u03bb (x; k, p, q, h)),\nwhere h = \u2212km \u2212 n \u2212 12 p \u2212 q, are called super Jacobi polynomials. It\nturns out that their specialized versions have a natural interpretation in the\nrepresentation theory as the Euler supercharacters of the orthosymplectic\nLie superalgebras osp(m, 2n).\nThere is a classical construction due to Borel, Weil and Bott of the irreducible representations of the complex semisimple Lie groups G in terms of\nthe cohomology of the holomorphic line bundles over the corresponding flag\nvarieties G/P . In the Lie supergroup case this leads to a virtual representation given by the Euler characteristic\nX\nE\u03bb =\n(\u22121)i H i (G/P, O\u03bb )\nfor certain sheaf cohomology groups; the corresponding supercharacter E\u03bb\nis called Euler supercharacter (see [7]).\n\nTheorem 3.2 ([8]). For special choices of parabolic subgroup P the Euler\nsupercharacters of osp(2m + 1, 2n) coincide with specialized super Jacobi\npolynomials\nE\u03bb = SJ\u03bb (u, v; \u22121, \u22121, 0).\n\n\f6\n\nA.N. SERGEEV AND A.P. VESELOV\n\nA similar fact holds for Lie superalgebra osp(2m, 2n) and SJ\u03bb (u, v; \u22121, 0, 0),\nbut the analogue of this result for the Lie superalgebra sl(m, n) is still to be\nfound (see [10] for further discussion).\nReferences\n[1] J.
