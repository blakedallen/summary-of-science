The most famous example is arguably Shor's polynomial-time quantum\nalgorithm for factoring [2], a task which is believed to require exponential time in a classical\ncomputer. Other problems for which quantum algorithms appear to be give exponential speedups include simulating quantum systems [3], solving Pell's equation [4], approximating the Jones\npolynomial [5, 6], and estimating certain properties of sparse systems of linear equations [7].\nUnfortunately, the apparent computational superiority of quantum mechanics is presently only\nconjectural. In fact, one cannot hope to separate the class of problems solved in polynomial time\nby quantum and classical computation without settling major open questions in computational\ncomplexity theory1 .\nA setting for which quantum computation is provably superior to classical is the one of query\ncomplexity (also known as decision tree complexity or black-box complexity). There one is given\nthe ability to query a black-box function and the goal is to determine a certain property of the\nfunction. The complexity of the problem is measured by the minimum number of queries needed\nto determine such property. In the quantum case, one is able to query the black-box in superposition, a feature which potentially renders it more powerful than the classical one.\nThe first example of a black-box problem exhibiting a superpolynomial separation of quantum\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nElectronic address: fgslbrandao@gmail.com\nElectronic address: fizmh@ug.edu.pl\n\n1\n\n?\n\nsuch as P = PSPACE.\n\n\f2\nand randomized classical query complexities was the recursive fourier sampling (RFS) problem of\nBernstein and Vazirani [8]. Soon after it, Simon presented a black-box problem with an exponential\nquantum-classical separation [9]; Simon's problem is also a good example of the usefulness of the\nquery complexity model for the development of new algorithms: its quantum solution was both\na motivation for and an important element in Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring [2]. Many\nother oracle separations have since been found, see e.g. [10\u201315]. In terms of complexity classes,\nthese query complexity results show the existence of an oracle U for which BQPU 6= BPPU .2\n\nHaving collected evidence that quantum computation is superior to randomized classical computation, it is interesting to get insight about where exactly does BQP sit in the zoo of classical\ncomplexity classes. For example, are there problems that a quantum computer can solve efficiently, but which a classical computer cannot even check a potential solution in reasonable time?\nThis is the question whether BQP \u2286 NP and already in the seminal paper [8], the RFS problem\nwas used to build an oracle U such that BQPU * NPU . One can go even further and ask for an\noracle for which BQP is not contained in the entire polynomial hierarchy (PH). In [8] it was conjectured that the RFS problem also gives an oracle relative to which BQP * PH, but whether this\nis indeed the case remains an open question.\n\nRecently, Aaronson [1] proposed an interesting new oracle problem as a candidate to put BQP\noutside PH.3 Although the usefulness of this oracle for the BQP vs. PH question still has to be\nelucidated, the problem was shown to have a huge separation of quantum and classical query\ncomplexities: it can be solved by a constant number of quantum queries, while it requires exponentially many queries by a classical machine, even if we give the classical machine the \u2013 extremely powerful \u2013 ability to postselect on a given result of the computation. This is the strongest\nseparation of quantum and classical query complexities to date. It also implies oracles relative to\nwhich BQP * BPPpath 4 and BQP * SZK, which supersedes all previous oracle separations for\nBQP.\nAaronson's problem, named F OURIER C HECKING , is the following: We are given two boolean\nfunctions f, g : {0, 1}n \u2192 {\u22121, 1} with the promise that either\n\u2022 f and g are chosen uniformly at random, or\nn\n\n\u2022 for a vector v \u2208 R2 with entries vx drawn independently from a normal distribution of\nmean 0 and variance 1, the functions are chosen as f (x) = sgn(vx ) and g(x) = sgn(v\u0302x ) 5 .\nHere the vector v\u0302 is the Fourier transform over Zn2 of v and is given by\nX\nv\u0302x =\n(\u22121)x.y vy .\n(1)\ny\u2208{0,1}n\n\nThe task is to decide which is the case. In words, we should determine if the two functions are\nnot correlated at all or if one of them is well correlated with the Fourier transform of the other.\nThe quantum algorithm proposed in [1] to solve the problem is particularly simple. One prepares the uniform superposition over the computational basis, queries f , applies the quantum\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nsee the complexity zoo (http://qwiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Complexity Zoo) for definitions of the standard complexity classes.\nIn [1] it was shown that the separation would follow from a certain generalization of the Linial-Nisan conjecture [16]\nrecently settled by Braverman [17]. However this generalization was later falsified in [18].\nHere BPPpath is defined as the class of problems which can be solved in polynomial time, with high probability, by a\nrandomized classical computer which can postselect on given outcomes of the computation [19].\nThe sign function is defined as: sgn(x) = 1 for x \u2265 0, and sgn(x) = \u22121 otherwise.\n\n\f3\nFourier transform (QFT), queries g, and checks if the final state is again in a uniform superposition\nover the computational basis. If the functions are independent, then there is only an exponential\nsmall chance of getting the right outcome in the final measurement, while in the case where they\nare correlated, this happens with constant probability.\nConsidering how well this problem fleshes out the superiority of quantum computation to\nclassical, it is worthwhile to try to understand what exactly gives its strength. For instance, what\nis the role played by the Fourier transform, both the the definition of the problem and in the\nquantum algorithm solving it? Can we replace it by some other transformation? One of the goals\nof this paper is to shed light on these questions.\nFrom a broader perspective, we will be concerned with the following question, central to our\nunderstanding of the computational capabilities offered by quantum mechanics: What is the set of\nquantum circuits which provide large quantum speed-ups? More precisely, for which quantum\ncircuits can we construct black-box problems which are solved by the circuit with only a few\nqueries to the black-box, but which require a large number of queries for randomized classical\ncomputation? This question is in a sense a converse to the well-studied problem of characterizing\nthe class of black-box functions allowing for significant quantum speed-ups (see e.g. [20, 21]).\nWhile the latter deals with the determination of which computational problems are suited for\nquantum computing, the former contributes to the classification of which quantum algorithmic\ntechniques are useful for solving problems efficiently.\nFor instance, all the early examples of quantum algorithms offering superpolynomial speedups [8, 9, 22, 23] were based on the quantum Fourier transform and this led to the speculation\nthat it could be the defining aspect of quantum computation behind quantum speed-ups. Subsequently, other black-box problems showing a quantum advantage were found having no relation\nto the QFT [6, 15, 24], hence extending the scope of techniques for constructing quantum algorithms.\nOf particular note in this context, and for this paper, is the work of Hallgren and Harrow [24] on\ngeneralizations of Bernstein and Vazirani's RFS problem. The RFS classical\u2013quantum separation\nis built in two steps: first one construct a black-box problem requiring a constant number of\nquantum queries, but \u03a9(n) classical queries. Then one uses recursion to boost the separation to a\nnO(1) quantum versus nlog(n) classical queries. The oracle problem in the first part is based on the\nFourier transform and solved by the QFT. In [24] it was shown that this problem could be modified\nto have almost any quantum circuit (from a natural measure on circuits) in the place of the Fourier\ntransform and still achieve the constant versus linear separation, as in the original formulation.\nMoreover, any such problem could also be boosted by recursion to provide a black-box problem\nwith a superpolynomial quantum-to-classical gap in query complexity.\n\nA.\n\nOur results\n\nIn this paper we generalize Aaroson's F OURIER C HECKING problem [1] and show that the\nFourier transform, both in the definition of the problem and in the quantum algorithm solving\nit, can be replaced by a large class of quantum circuits. These include both the Fourier transform\nover any (possibly non-abelian) finite group and almost any sufficiently long quantum circuit from\na natural distribution on the set of quantum circuits, which we discuss later on. We obtain exponential separations of quantum and postselected classical query complexities for all such circuits.\nFlat circuits imply exponential separation: In more detail, we first introduce a simple measure of\nflatness, or dispersiveness, of a unitary U on n qubits, denoted C(U ) . It is defined as the minimal\n\n\f4\nmin-entropy6 (over j \u2208 {0, .., 2n \u2212 1}) of the outcome probability distribution of a computational\nbasis measurement applied to U |ji. For N := 2n ,\n\u0001\nC(U ) := min hmin {|h0|U |ji|2 , ..., |hN \u2212 1|U |ji|2 } ,\n(2)\nj\u2208[N ]\n\nwith [N ] := {0, ..., N \u2212 1}. It thus measures the worst-case dispersiveness of states obtained by\napplying U to computational basis states.\n\nIn section II A we define, for a unitary U , the black-box problem U-C IRCUIT C HECKING , a\nvariant of F OURIER C HECKING in which the Fourier transform in the definition of the vector v\u0302\n(given by Eq. (1)) is replaced by U . The problem is constructed so that a quantum computer can\neasily solve it with access to a few realizations of the unitary U , while it is classically hard for any\nU with large C(U ).\nIn detail, on one hand we prove a lower bound of 2\u03a9(C(U )) on the classical query complexity\nwith postselection of U-C IRCUIT C HECKING (see section IV). Following the ideas of [1], we do so\nby showing that the discretized version of the random vector (v, U v) \u2013 for a vector v composed\nof independent elements vx each drawn from a normal distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 \u2013\nis kO(1) 2\u03a9(C(U )) -almost k-wise independent (a fact which was shown to imply the previous exponential lower bound on the postselected classical query complexity [1]).\nOn the other hand, on a quantum computer we can solve U-C IRCUIT C HECKING by the\nfollowing simple\nmodification of Aaaroson's algorithm: we prepare each qubit in the |+i :=\n\u221a\n(|0i + |1i)/ 2 state, forming the uniform superposition over the computational basis. Then we\nquery the f function, apply the circuit U , query the g function, and measure each qubit in the\nHadamard basis, accepting if all of them are found in the |+i state. Therefore we obtain:\nTheorem I For any circuit U acting on n qubits with C(U ) = \u03a9(n), the problem UC IRCUIT C HECKING shows an exponential separation of quantum and postselected classical query complexities.\nWe then proceed by giving two classes of unitaries with C(U ) = \u03a9(n).\nTheorem II\n(i) Let UQFT (G) be the quantum Fourier transform over the finite group G. Then C(UQFT (G)) \u2265\n1\n2 log |G|.\n(ii) Given any 2\u22123tn -approximate unitary t-design on n qubits, all but a 2\u2212(t(1\u2212\u03b2)\u22122)n+1 fraction of\nits elements have C(U ) \u2265 \u03b2n.\nIn particular, we find that for 2\u22129n -approximate unitary 3-designs, all but a 2\u2212n/2+1 fraction of\nits element have C(U ) \u2265 n/6. We note that the result of the theorem does not appear to hold true\nfor unitary 2-designs and thus we seem to have the first application of unitary t-designs for t > 2.\nThe proofs of both statements of Theorem II are elementary and are given in section III.\nRandom circuits are unitary 3-designs: A unitary t-design is an ensemble of unitaries {\u03bc(dU ), U },\nfor a measure \u03bc on the set of unitaries, such that the average (over \u03bc) of any t-degree polynomial\non the entries of U and their complex conjugates is equal to the average over the Haar measure.\n6\n\nFor a probability distribution p(x) we define its min-entropy as hmin (p) := \u2212 log maxx p(x)\n\n\f5\nAn approximate unitary t-design is a relaxed version of the previous definition, in which we only\nrequire that the averages are close to each other (see section II C for a precise definition) [25, 26].\nIn a series of papers [27\u201331] it was established that polynomially long random quantum circuits constitute an approximate unitary 2-design. The random quantum circuit model used is the\nfollowing: in each step a random pair of qubits is chosen and a gate from a universal set of gates,\nalso chosen at random, is applied to them. Although there is evidence that random quantum\ncircuits of polynomial lenght are unitary t-design for every t = poly(n) [32, 33], this has not been\nrigorously proved so far, even for the 3-design case.\nHere we prove that random quantum circuits are indeed approximate unitary 3-designs. We\nshow it both for the random circuit model of the previous paragraph and for a different one,\nintroduced in [34] as a toy model for the evolution of black holes, which is more suited for the\nmethods we employ. In this model, which we call local random quantum circuit model, the qubits\nare arranged in a circle and in each step a random two-qubit gate is applied to two neighbouring\nqubits.\nTheorem III 5n log(1/\u03b5)-size local random quantum circuits form an \u03b5-approximate unitary 3-design.\nThe proof of Theorem III is based on a reduction, first put forward by Brown and Viola [33],\nconnecting the convergence rate of moments of the random quantum circuit to the spectral gap\n(the difference of the lowest and second lowest eigenvalues) of a quantum local Hamiltonian. Our\nmain contribution is to show in section VI that we can obtain a lower bound on this spectral gap\nemploying a technique from quantum many-body theory used e.g. in [35\u201338].\nIn particular, using this technique we are able to reduce the problem of bounding the spectral\ngap of the random walk on n qubits induced by the random circuit, to bounding the spectral gap\nof the same random walk, but now defined only on three neighbouring qubits. Then it suffices to\nbound the convergence time of the second and third moments of the latter random walk in order\nto prove that the random circuit constitute a 3-design. We believe our approach is promising\nalso for higher values of t and might pave the way to a proof that random quantum circuits are\napproximate unitary t-designs for all t = poly(n). We however leave such possibility as an open\nproblem for future work.\nCombining Theorems III and II we obtain our main result that almost any polynomial quantum\ncircuit is useful for exponential quantum speed-ups.\nTheorem IV For the distribution induced by the local random quantum circuit model, all but a 2\u2212\u03a9(n)\nfraction of quantum circuits U with more than O(n2 ) gates are such that U-C IRCUIT C HECKING shows\nan exponential gap in the quantum and the postselected classical query complexities.\nThe role of C(U ) and classical efficient solution for sparse unitaries: We have seen that dispersive unitaries U with large C(U ) give an exponential speed-up in U-C IRCUIT C HECKING . Is a\nlarge C(U ) always required for a speed-up? We present two results indicating that this is indeed\nthe case.\nFirst we show that with a modified notion of oracle access (we call it the independent query\nmodel), in which a different independent realization of the random parameters of the oracle is\nchosen in each query, a linear C(U ) is necessary for an exponential speed-up.\nTheorem V In the independent query model of oracle access, the randomized classical query complexity\nof U-C IRCUIT C HECKING is equal to 2\u0398(C(U )) .\n\n\f6\nSecond we consider the circuit checking problem for approximately-sparse U , defined as unitaries which can be approximated (in operator norm) by a sparse matrix with only polynomially\nmany non-zero entries in each row and column. Then we show the following.\nTheorem VI For approximately-sparse U\nC IRCUIT C HECKING is polynomial.\n\nthe randomized classical query complexity of U-\n\nWe prove Theorem VI by showing how a recent result of Van den Nest [39] on the classical\nsimulability of certain quantum states and operations implies that the quantum algorithm for\nU-C IRCUIT C HECKING with a sparse U can be efficiently simulated with only polynomial many\nclassical queries to f and g.\n\nB.\n\nRelated Work\n\nThis paper has a similar flavor to Hallgren and Harrow's work on the RFS problem [24]. The\nidea of considering the dispersiveness of quantum circuits as a resource for oracle speed-ups also\nfirst appeared in [24], where a different, but related, notion of dispersive circuits was proposed\nand a constant versus linear separation in query complexity was shown for all such dispersive\ncircuits; in section II B we discuss it in more detail and show that our definition of a dispersive\ncircuit is somewhat more demanding than theirs (although not completely comparable). In [24] it\nwas shown that both the Fourier transform over any finite group and almost any sufficiently long\nquantum circuit are dispersive. Implicit in their work is also the statement that most elements\nof an approximate unitary 2-design are dispersive. Although their definition of dispersiveness is\nweaker than ours and therefore broader, the separations we obtain are much stronger. While we\nget an exponential separation of quantum and postselected classical query complexities, they get\na superpolynomial versus polynomial separation of quantum and classical query complexities,\nand only by using recursion (which itself can be seen as the responsible for the superpolynomial\nspeed-up).\nThere has been a series of work [25, 26, 30, 40, 42] on unitary t-designs (and on the closely\nrelated quantum expanders [43\u201348]) and on their connection to random quantum circuits [25\u201333].\nAn important problem in this area is to derive efficient constructions on a quantum computer\nof approximate unitary t-designs. While there are several efficient constructions for 2-designs\n[25, 43, 46, 47], there is only a single one (based on the QFT) for unitary t-design on n qubits with\nt > 2 (going up to t = \u03a9(n/ log(n))) [41]. Our proof that random quantum circuits constitute a\n3-design gives an alternative efficient construction for the t = 3 case.\nRecently Brown and Viola [33] proposed an interesting approach to the problem of random\nquantum circuits as unitary t-designs, based on mapping the convergence time of moments of\nthe random circuit to the spectral gap of a mean-field quantum Hamiltonian. Conditioned on\nan unproven, but reasonable, conjecture about the low-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, they\nshowed that random quantum circuits of linear length are t-designs for every fixed t and sufficiently large n. Our approach also starts by a reduction of the problem to lower bounding the\nspectral gap of quantum Hamiltonians. However, in our case, we find a local quantum Hamiltonian, consisting of nearest-neighbor terms only. We are also able to rigorously lower bound such\nspectral gap for t \u2264 3, therefore obtaining a complete proof in this case.\n\nAfter the completion of our work, we learned about a recent paper by Fefferman and Umans\n[49], in which the problem U-C IRCUIT C HECKING is also considered. Their focus is to study\nthe usefulness of this problem in constructing an oracle separation of BQP and PH, by relating\n\n\f7\nsuch possibility to a conjecture [50] about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom\ngenerator [51] to fool AC0 . To this aim only unitaries of a very special structure are consired in\nU-C IRCUIT C HECKING . Our approach has the advantage that we can show an exponential gap of\nquantum and postselected-classical query complexities for a generic polynomial quantum circuit\n(a task not considered in [49]), but has the drawback that we fail to give evidence that there are\ncircuits providing a separation of BQP to PH.\n\nII.\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\nA. The oracle problem and its quantum solution\n\nGiven a unitary U \u2208 U(N ) (with U(N ) the group of N \u00d7 N unitary matrices) we consider the\nfollowing extension of the F OURIER C HECKING problem [1]:\nU-C IRCUIT C HECKING : We are given access to two black-box functions7 f, g : {0, 1}n \u2192\n{1, \u22121} with the promise that either\n\u2022 (independent and random) f and g are chosen independently and uniformly at random,\nwith each of their entries drawn from a random unbiased coin, or\n\u2022 (U -correlated) for a vector v \u2208 CN with entries vx drawn independently from a complex\nnormal distribution vx = vx,r + ivx,i , with vx,r and vx,i normal real variables of mean 0 and\nvariance 1, the functions are chosen as f (x) = sgn(Re(vx )) and g(x) = sgn(Re((U v)x )) 8 .\nThe vector U v is given explicitely by\nX\n(U v)x =\nUxy vy .\n(3)\ny\u2208[N ]\n\nThe problem is to decide which is the case.\nConsider the following quantum algorithm for solving U-C IRCUIT C HECKING , where U acts\non n qubits:\nQuantum Algorithm for U-C IRCUIT C HECKING :\n(i) Prepare each of the n qubits in the |+i state.\n(ii) Query the f oracle.\n(iii) Apply the unitary U .\n(iv) Query the g oracle.\n(v) Measure each qubit in the Hadamard basis {|+i, |\u2212i} and accept if all qubits are in the |+i state.\nLet\n|f i :=\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1\n2n/2\n\nX\n\nx\u2208{0,1}n\n\n(\u22121)f (x) |xi\n\n(4)\n\nIn this work we consider the phase-oracle model for quantum queries. Namely, let Uf be the oracle unitary of f and\n|xi a computational basis state. Then Uf |xi = (\u22121)f (x) |xi (and likewise for g).\nhere Re(z) is the real part of the complex number z.\n\n\f8\nand\n1\n\n|gi :=\n\n2n/2\n\nX\n\nx\u2208{0,1}n\n\n(\u22121)g(x) |xi\n\n(5)\n\nThen it follows that the acceptance probability of the algorithm is given by\npU (f, g) := |hg|U |f i|2 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe next proposition shows the quantum algorithm above can distinguish the cases of correlated\n(by the action of U) and independent f and g.\nProposition II.1 If f and g are drawn independently and uniformily at random,\n1\n2n\n\nE (pU (f, g)) =\n\n(7)\n\nwhile if f and g are U-correlated,\nE (pU (f, g)) \u2265 0.07\n\n(8)\n\nProof In [1] Aaronson proved the proposition for the case in which U is the quantum Fourier\ntransform over Zn2 , which appeared as Theorem 9 in [1]. A closer inspection at his proof shows\nthat the only property of the quantum Fourier used is the fact that it is a unitary. Therefore the\nreasoning of [1] can be applied here without any modification. We omit reproducing the full\nargument and instead refer the reader to [1].\n\u2294\n\u2293\nB.\n\nDispersing Circuits\n\nWe now define a notion of dispersive, or flat, circuits which will play a central role in this work.\nLet hmin be the min-entropy defined as\nhmin (p) = \u2212 log max p(x).\nx\n\n(9)\n\nDefinition II.2 For a unitary U we define:\n\u0001\nC(U ) := min hmin {|h0|U |ji|2 , ..., |hN \u2212 1|U |ji|2 }\nj\u2208[N ]\n\n= \u2212 log\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\nmax |Ui,j |\n\ni,j\u2208[N ]\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nIt is interesting to compare this definition of a dispersive circuit with Harrow and Hallgren's\n[24]:\nDefinition II.3 (HH-dispersiveness [24]) A unitary U \u2208 U(2n ) is (\u03b1, \u03b2)-dispersing if there exists a set\nA \u2286 {0, 1}n with |A| \u2265 2\u03b1n and\nX\nn\n(12)\n|ha|U |xi| \u2265 \u03b22 2\nx\u2208{0,1}n\n\nfor all a \u2208 A.\n\n\f9\nThus while Def. II.2 looks at the infinity norm of the outcome probability distribution of measurements in the computational basis, maximized over all initial computational basis states, HHdispersiveness (Def. II.3) is concerned with the 1-norm of such probability distribution, and the\nmaximum taken only over a constant-size fraction of all the computational basis states.\nIn [24] it was shown that (\u03b1, \u03b2)\u2212dispersing circuits, for \u03b1, \u03b2 = O(1), are useful for speed-ups\nin the variant of the RFS problem there defined. If we allow for lower values of \u03b2 than a constant\n(but still requiring the circuit to be fairly flat), then a dispersive unitary according to Def. II.2 is\nalso HH-dispersive. Indeed, a simple calculation (which we omit here) shows that if U is such\nthat C(U ) \u2265 \u03b3n, then U is also (1, 2(\u03b3\u22121)n/2 )-dispersive according to Def. II.3.\nC.\n\nApproximate Unitary Designs\n\nWe start defining a norm on quantum operations which we will use to compare two superoper1\nators. For X \u2208 B(Cd ) we define the p-Schatten norms kXkp := tr(|X|p ) p . Then for a superoperator\n\u2032\n\u039b : B(Cd ) \u2192 B(Cd ) we define the p \u2192 q induced Schatten norm as\nk\u039b(X)kp\n.\nX6=0 kXkq\n\nk\u039b(X)kp\u2192q := sup\n\n(13)\n\nFinally, the diamond norm is defined as the CB-completion of the 1 \u2192 1 norm,\nk\u039bk\u22c4 := sup kId \u2297 \u039bk1\u21921 .\n\n(14)\n\nd\n\nThere are several different definitions of \u03b5-approximate unitary t-designs.

Following [1], our strategy will be to\nshow that the distribution in the U-C IRCUIT C HECKING problem in the case of U-correlated strings\nis approximately k-wise independent. Then the result follows from the following proposition\nfrom [1], relating this property to bounds on the postselected query complexity of distinguishing\nsuch distribution from the uniform one:\nProposition IV.1 (Lemma 20 of [1]) Suppose a probability distribution D over oracle strings is \u03b4-almost\nk-wise independent. Then no bounded-error postselected classical machine running in less than k steps can\ndistinguish D from the uniform distribution with bias larger than 2\u03b4.\nProof (Theorem I) Propositions IV.3 and IV.1 give a lower bound of 2C(U )/7 on the classical query\ncomplexity with postselection of U-C IRCUIT C HECKING .

CLASSICAL UPPER BOUNDS\n\nIn this section we prove Theorems V and VI.\nProof (Theorem V)\nLet (i, j) be such that |Ui,j | = 2\u2212C(U )/2 . Assuming that Re(Ui,j ) \u2265 Im(Ui,j ) 9 , we get Re(Ui,j ) \u2265\n\n2\u2212C(U )/2+1 .\n\nThe algorithm for U-C IRCUIT C HECKING in the independent query model works as follows:\nOne queries fr (i) and gr (j) over N = \u2308Re(Ui,j )\u22122 log(1/\u01eb)\u2309 independent realizations of the oracle\n(labelled by r) and computes\nEN\n\nN\n1 X\n:=\nfr (i)gr (j),\nN r=1\n\ndeciding that the functions are U-correlated if EN \u2265 Re(Ui,j )/4.\n9\n\nOtherwise we consider instead the unitary\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22121U\n\n(43)\n\n\f14\nIn the case of independent f and g, we have E(f (i)g(j)) = 0. In the remainder of the proof we\nshow that for U-correlated f and g, E(f (i)g(j)) \u2265 Re(Ui,j )/2. Then Chernoff bound gives that the\nalgorithm fails with probability at most \u01eb.\nLet us turn to the lower bound on E(f (i)g(j)) in the case of U-correlated f and g. We have\nE(f (i)g(j)) = E(sgn(Re(vi ))sgn(Re(U v)j )).\n\n(44)\n\nNote that E(Re(vi )Re(U v)j )) = Re(Ui,j ) \u2265 2\u2212(C(U )/2+1) . So all we have to do is to check that the\ndiscretized version given by Eq. (44) has a similar expectation value.\nFirst we write\nE(sgn(Re(vi ))sgn(Re(U v)j )) = Pr (Re(vi )Re(U v)j \u2265 0) \u2212 Pr (Re(vi )Re(U v)j < 0)\n= 2 Pr (Re(vi )Re(U v)j \u2265 0) \u2212 1\n\n= 4 Pr (Re(vi ) \u2265 0 and Re(U v)j \u2265 0) \u2212 1.\n\n(45)\n\nNow define the bivariate normal variable w := (w1 , w2 ) with w1 = vi and w2 := (U v)j .

We will make use of the notion of computational tractable states, which are defined below in a\nslightly more general way than in [39], in order to accommodate for oracle queries.\nDefinition V.1 [39] A state on n qubits |\u03c8i is f -computational tractable given access to the oracle function f\u03c8 : {0, 1}m \u2192 {0, 1} (with m = poly(n)) if the following holds\n(a) it is possible to sample from the probability distribution Pr(x) := |hx|\u03c8i|2 on the set of n-bit\nstrings in poly(n) time in a classical computer with poly(n) many queries to f\u03c8 , and\n\n\f15\n(b) upon input of any bit of x, the coefficient hx|\u03c8i can be computed in poly(n) time on a classical\ncomputer with poly(n) queries to f\u03c8 .\nThen we have:\nProposition V.2 [39] Let |\u03c8i and |\u03c6i be f -computational tractable states (given access to oracle f ) of n\nqubits each and let A be an efficiently computable sparse n-qubit operation with kAk\u221e \u2264 1. Then there\nexists an efficient classical algorithm to approximate h\u03c6|A|\u03c8i with polynomial accuracy in n, given access\nto the oracle f .\nIn [39] Van den Nest proved Proposition V.2 in the non-oracular case. However, it is easy to check\nthat his proof carries through without any modification to cover the statement of Proposition V.2.\nProof (Theorem VI)\nLet \u0168 be the sparse approximation of U with only poly(n) many non-zero entries in each row\nand column and such that kU \u2212 \u0168 k\u221e \u2264 0.03. Let |f i and |gi be the states given by Eqs. (4)\nand (5). Note that |f i and |gi are f - and g-computational tractable, respectively. Indeed any of\ntheir coefficients can be read directly from the oracles f and g, while the probability distribution\nPr(x) := |hx|f i|2 (and analogously |hx|gi|2 ) is uniform and therefore easily samplable.\n\nFrom Proposition II.1 we see it suffices to calculate |hg|U |f i|2 to accuracy < 0.07 in order to\nsolve U-C IRCUIT C HECKING with high probability and, indeed,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n||hg|U |f i|2 \u2212 |hg|\u0168 |f i|2 | = |hf | U |gihg|U \u2020 \u2212 \u0168 |gihg|\u0168 \u2020 |f i|\n\u2264\n\nU |gihg|U \u2020 \u2212 \u0168 |gihg|\u0168 \u2020\n\n=\n\nU |gi \u2212 \u0168 |gi .

Given a superoperator G given by\nX\nG(X) :=\nAk XBk\u2020 ,\n(49)\nk\n\nwe define the operator\nG :=\n\nX\nk\n\nAk \u2297 B k ,\n\n(50)\n\nwith X the complex conjugate of X.\nLet X be such that tr(XX \u2020 ) = 1 and G(X) = \u03bbX, for a complex number \u03bb, i.e. X is an\neigenoperator of G with eigenvalue \u03bb. Then defining |Xi := X \u2297 I|\u03a6i, with\nX\n|\u03a6i :=\n|ki \u2297 |ki,\n(51)\nk\n\nit holds that G|Xi = \u03bb|Xi, i.e. |Xi is an eingenvector of G with eingenvalue \u03bb.\nA direct implication of this correspondence is that\n\nkGk2\u21922 = kGk\u221e .\n\n(52)\n\nProof (Theorem III)\nLet {\u03bc(dU ), U } be the distribution of unitaries after one step of the random walk according to\nthe local random circuit model. Following Eq. (49), define\nZ\n\u2297t\n\u03bc\u2217k (dU )U \u2297t \u2297 U .\nG\u03bc\u2217k ,t :=\n(53)\nU(d)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u2217k is the k-fold convolution of \u03bc with itself, i.e.\nZ\n\u2217k\n\u03bc := \u03b4U1 ...Uk \u03bc(dU1 )...\u03bc(dUk ).\n\n(54)\n\nIn the sequel we show that for t = 2, 3,\nkG\u03bc\u2217k ,t \u2212 G\u03bcH ,t k\u221e \u2264\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\n5n\n\n\u0013k\n\n,\n\n(55)\n\nwith \u03bcH is the Haar measure on U(2n ). Then by Def. II.4 and Eq. (52) we find that\n{\u03bc\u22175n log(1/\u01eb) (dU ), U } is an \u01eb-approximate unitary 3-design, which is the statement of the theorem.\nFollowing [33], we have G\u03bc\u2217k ,t = (Mt,n )k , with\n\nn\n\nMt,n :=\n\n1X\nPi,i+1\nn\n\n(56)\n\ni=1\n\nand\nPi,i+1 :=\n\nZ\n\nU(4)\n\n\u2297t\n\n\u2297t\n\u03bcH (dU )Ui,i+1\n\u2297 U i,i+1 .\n\n(57)\n\n\f17\nMoreover the projector onto the eigenvalue-one subspace of Mt is equal to G\u03bcH ,t , since [30, 33]\nlim kG\u03bc\u2217k ,t \u2212 G\u03bcH ,t k\u221e = 0.\n\n(58)\n\nkG\u03bc\u2217k ,t \u2212 G\u03bcH ,t k\u221e = (\u03bb2 (Mt,n ))k ,\n\n(59)\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nTherefore\n\nwith \u03bbk (X) the k-th largest eigenvalue of X.\nLemma VI.1 and Lemma VI.4 gives that \u03bb2 (Mt,n ) \u2264 1 \u2212\nthis bound and Eq.

It shows that in order to upper bound\n\u03bb2 (Mt,n ) it is enough to obtain a sufficiently strong upper bound on \u03bb2 (Mt,3 ). The latter is associated to the convergence time of a random walk on only three qubits and, therefore, can be more\neasily analysed.\nLemma VI.1\n3 \u2212 4\u03bb2 (Mt,3 )\n.\nn\n\n(60)\n\nHi,i+1 = n(I \u2212 Mt,n ).\n\n(61)\n\n\u03bb2 (Mt,n ) \u2264 1 \u2212\nProof Define Hi,i+1 := I \u2212 Pi,i+1 and\nH :=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nThe operator H is a quantum local Hamiltonian (i.e. a sum of terms which act non-trivially\nonly on neighbouring sites), composed of local projectors Hi,i+1 , with the following properties:\n\u2022 periodic boundary conditions: the (i + 1)-th site is identified with the first.\n\u2022 zero gound-state energy: \u03bbmin (H) = 0, with \u03bbmin (H) the minimum eigenvalue of H.\n\u2022 frustation-freeness: every state |\u03c8i in the grounstate manifold, composed of all eigenvectors\nwith eigenvalue zero, is such that Hi,i+1 |\u03c8i = 0, for all i.\nLet \u2206(X) be the spectral gap of X, i.e. the difference of the second lowest to the lowest eigenvalues.

Moreover, the subspace defined by Pi is spanned by the (overcomplete)\nbasis given by the non-normalized vectors |V\u03c0,i i := V\u03c0,i \u2297 I|\u03a6i.\nLikewise we define\n\nPi,i+1 (X) :=\n\nZ\n\nU(4)\n\n\u2020\n\u2297t\n\u03bcH (dU )Ui,i+1\nX(Ui,i+1\n)\u2297t ,\n\n(75)\n\nand again we find that any X invariant under Pi,i+1 can be written as a sum of permutartion\n\u2297t\noperators V\u03c0,(i,i+1) , now permuting the t copies of the Hilbert space Hi,i+1\n.\nSince V\u03c0,(i,i+1) = V\u03c0,i \u2297 V\u03c0,i+1 it follows that Pi,i+1 \u2282 Pi \u2297 Pi+1 and thus\n\nP12 \u2297 I3 + I1 \u2297 P23 = (P12 \u2297 P3 + P1 \u2297 P23 ) \u2295 (P12 \u2297 P3\u22a5 ) \u2295 (P1\u22a5 \u2297 P23 )\n\n(76)\n\nSince the last two terms in the direct sum above have eigenvalues 0 and 1, it follows that\n\u03bb2 (Mt,3 ) = \u03bb2 (X)/2, with X given by\nX = P12 \u2297 P3 + P1 \u2297 P23 .\nNote that the support of X is contained in P1 \u2297 P2 \u2297 P3 .\n\n(77)\n\nNow, for any Hilbert space H, in a subspace spanned by swaps acting on H\u2297t one can construct\na basis of operators which is orthonormal in Hilbert-Schmidt scalar product:\nX\nRk =\nbk\u03c0 V\u03c0\n(78)\n\u03c0\n\n\f20\nwhere the coefficients bk\u03c0 do not depend on the dimension of H, but only on t (we do not write\nthis dependence explicitly).

To this end we use (78), which in our case read\nX\n(1,2)\nRk\n=\nbk\u03c0 V\u03c0,1 \u2297 V\u03c0,2\n\u03c0\n\n(1)\nRk\n\n=\n\nX\n\nbk\u03c0 V\u03c0,1\n\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nRk =\n\nX\n\nbk\u03c0 V\u03c0,2 .\n\nX\n\n(k)\nrs,u\nRs \u2297 Ru\n\n(80)\n\n\u03c0\n\n(81)\n\nA simple calculation gives\nRk1,2 =\n\ns,u\n\n(82)\n\n(k)\n\nwhere the coefficients rs,u form a matrix given by\nr (k) = (B \u22121 )T A(k) B \u22121\n\n(83)\n\nwith B defined as the matrix with entries bkl and A(k) the diagonal matrices\n(k)\n\nAij = \u03b4ij bki .\n\n(84)\n\nIn this way, from the matrix B we can obtain the matrix elements of the projectors P1,2 and P2,3\n(3)\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)\nin the product bases Rk \u2297 Rl and Rk \u2297 Rl , respectively. These, in turn, allow us to obtain the\nmatrix elements of X and to compute its eigenvalues. In the following we perform the analysis\nfor t = 2 and t = 3.\n2-design. For t = 2, the basis is given by (suitably normalized) projectors onto the symmetric\nand the antisymmetric subspace. The matrix B is then given by\n#\n\"\nB=\n\n\u221a1\n3\n1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n3\n\u2212 21\n\nwhere the basis of swaps was ordered as {(), (12)} 10 , while the matrices r (k) are given by\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u221a\n0 0 0 0\n\u03b1 0 0 \u03b1\u03b2\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n1\uf8ef\n1\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0 1 1 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 0 0 0 \uf8fa\nr (1) = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa , r (2) = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa.\n2\uf8f00 1 1 0\uf8fb\n2\uf8f0 0 0 0 0 \uf8fb\n\u221a\n0 0 0 0\n\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 \u03b2\n10\n\nHere () labels the trivial permutation and (12) the swap of systems 1 and 2.\n\n(85)\n\n(86)\n\n\f21\nwith \u03b1 = 59 , \u03b2 = 15 . Diagonalizing X, we obtain that it has the second largest eigenvalue 7/5\nwhich gives \u03bb2 (M3,t ) = 7/10 for t = 2.\n\n11 ,\n\n3-design. Here we exploit the orthonormal basis constructed in [54]:\n1\n(I + V(12) + V(13) + V(23) + V(123) + V(132) ),\n12\n1\nR\u2212 = (I \u2212 V(12) \u2212 V(13) \u2212 V(23) + V(123) + V(132) ),\n12\n1\nR0 = (I \u2212 R+ \u2212 R\u2212 ),\n2\n1\nR1 = (2V(23) \u2212 V(13) \u2212 V(12) ),\n6\n1\nR2 = \u221a (V(12) \u2212 V(13) ),\n2 3\ni\nR3 = \u221a (V(123) \u2212 V(132) ).\n2 3\nR+ =\n\n(87)\n\nwhere permutations are written by means of cycles. The related matrix B is given by\n\uf8ee\n\n2\n3\n\n0 \u2212 13 \u2212 31\n2\n\u2212 31 0\n0\n3\n1\n\u221a\n0 \u2212 3 0\n0\n\n0\n0 \u2212 13\n0 \u221a13\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n1\uf8ef\nB= \uf8ef\n2\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8f0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n6\n\n1\n6\n\u2212 16 \u2212 61\n\n6\n1\n6\n\n0\n\n1\n6\n\u2212 61\n\n\u221ai\n3\n1\n6\n1\n6\n\n\u2212 \u221ai3\n1\n6\n1\n6\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n(88)\n\nwhere the basis of swaps is ordered as follows {(), (12), (23), (13), (123), (132)}. Since we work\nwith qubits, R3 = 0 and hence we have 5 basis elements and X is a 125 \u00d7 125 matrix. We have\ncomputed its matrix elements and then its eigenvalues11 , and found that again the second largest\neigenvalue is equal to 7/5.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nLastly, let us discuss the case of uniform random circuits. We have:\nProposition VI.5 5n2 log(1/\u01eb)-sized uniform random circuits form an \u01eb-approximate unitary 3-design.\nProof Following the proof of Theorem III is suffices to show that for t = 3,\n1\n5n2\n\n(89)\n\n1 X\nPi,j\nn2\n\n(90)\n\n\u03bb2 (Nt,n ) \u2264 1 \u2212\nwith\nNt,n :=\n\ni<j\n\nand\nPi,j :=\n\n11\n\nZ\n\nU(4)\n\n\u2297t\n\n\u2297t\n\u03bcH (dU )Ui,j\n\u2297 U i,j .\n\nWe have diagonalized the matrix X using the symbolic manipulation program Mathematica.\n\n(91)\n\n\f22\nDefining\nH\u0303 :=\n\nX\ni,j\n\nHi,j = n2 (I \u2212 Nt,n )\n\n(92)\n\nwith Hi,j = I \u2212 Pi,j , we find Eq. (89) to be equivalent to \u2206(H\u0303) \u2265 1/5.\n\nBoth H\u0303 and H (given by Eq. (61)) have the same groundspace S0 . Furtermore, H\u0303 \u2265 H. Then\n\u2206(H\u0303) \u2265 min h\u03c8|H\u0303|\u03c8i \u2265 min h\u03c8|H|\u03c8i = \u2206(H) \u2265\n|\u03c8i\u22a5S0\n\n|\u03c8i\u22a5S0\n\nwhere the last inequality follows from Lemmas VI.1 and VI.4.\n\nVII.\n\n1\n,\n5\n\n(93)\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Salman Beigi for useful correspondence.
