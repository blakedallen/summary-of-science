We shall first show that\nRegge theory can be used to constrain the initial condition for DGLAP\nevolution. We shall then spell out a method to extract Regge couplings\nat high Q2 using DGLAP evolution.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs it is well known, Regge theory and DGLAP evolution both provide very good\ndescriptions of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). One may therefore try to see\nif these two approaches are consistent[1, 2]. However, this question is far from\nevident due to the essential singularity generated by DGLAP evolution.\nMoreover, we have shown in [3] that, as required by Regge theory, it is\npossible to describe all processes using the same singularity structure in complex\nj-plane. We shall show that this universal behaviour can be extended to parton\ndistribution functions (PDF), i.e. that we can choose an initial condition for\nDGLAP evolution with a common singularity structure. In this picture, F2 is\ndescribes by Regge theory for Q2 < Q20 and by DGLAP equation for larger\nscales.\nFinally, one has seen that, using a triple-pole pomeron, one can extend\nRegge theory to high values of Q2 , where we expect perturbative QCD (pQCD)\nto apply. In other words, the high-Q2 behaviour of the Regge couplings must\nbe predicted by DGLAP evolution. We shall see in section 3 that it is the case\nfor the triple-pole pomeron model.\n2\n\nConstraints on initial condition\n\nIf we only want to reproduce F2p , we only need two quark distributions (q + =\nq + q\u0304): T = x(u+ + c+ + t+ ) \u2212 x(d+ + s+ + b+ ) evolving alone and \u03a3 =\nx(u+ + c+ + t+ ) \u2212 x(d+ + s+ + b+ ) coupled with the gluon distribution G = xg.\nUsing these definitions, the proton structure function becomes F2p = 5\u03a3+3T\n18 .\nIf we introduce a scale Q20 where DGLAP evolution breaks down, parton\ndistributions will be described by a triple pole term and an a0 /f -reggeon term\nfor Q2 \u2264 Q20 while an essential singularity arising from DGLAP evolution will\nbe present at larger scales. Since Regge theory does not extend up to x = 1,\nwe shall use GRV parton distribution functions for x > xGRV . Moreover, the\npomeron contribution to T must vanish because the pomeron is insentive to\nquark flavours and we shall assume that the reggeon, being mainly constituted\n\u2217 G.\n\nSoyez is supported by the FNRS, Belgium; e-mail: g.soyez@ulg.ac.be\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n2 CONSTRAINTS ON INITIAL CONDITION\n\n0.1\n\n5\n0.01\n8.5\n\n15\n25\n0.001\n\n45\n\nF2 /Q4\n\n70\n120\n\n1e-04\n200\n350\n1e-05\n\n650\n1200\n\n1e-06\n\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\nx\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 1: Fit to F2p structure function with Q20 = 5 GeV2 and xGRV = 0.1.

In\nthis case, the DGLAP evolution equation must be able to predict the residues at\nhigh Q2 . In such a case, due to the essential singularity generated by DGLAP\nevolution, we may only consider the DGLAP equation as a numerical approximation. In order to find the residues we may therefore adopt the following\nstrategy:\n1. choose an initial scale Q20 ,\n2. choose a value for the parameters in the initial distribution,\n3. compute the parton distributions for Q20 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 Q2max using forward\nDGLAP evolution and for Q2min \u2264 Q2 \u2264 Q20 using backward DGLAP\n\n\f4\n\n3 REGGE COUPLINGS FROM DGLAP EVOLUTION\n\nevolution,\n4. repeat 2 and 3 until the value of the parameters reproducing the F2 data\nfor Q2 > Q2min and x \u2264 xGRV is found.\n5. This gives the residues at the scale Q20 and steps 1 to 4 are repeated in\norder to obtain the residues at all Q2 values.\n8\n\n6\nQ2 = 10.000 GeV2\n\n15\nQ2 = 27.219 GeV2\n\nQ2 = 74.089 GeV2\n\n6\n4\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\n10\n\n\u03a3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n2\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\nx\n\n10-1\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n1\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\nx\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n20\n\n15\nQ2 = 201.665 GeV2\n\n15\n\n10-2\nx\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10.000\n\n10\n\u03a3\n\n10-3\n\nQ02 values\n\nQ2 = 548.919 GeV2\n\n\u03a3\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n27.219\n\n10\n\n74.089\n\n5\n5\n\n201.665\n548.919\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\nx\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\nx\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: Quark singlet distribution obtained from our model. Each curve\ncorresponds to a choice of Q20 . F2 is described by a triple pole if Q2 = Q20 and\nby an essential singularity otherwise.\nAs we can see in Fig. 2, the form factors found by this method reproduce\nF2 successfully (For 10 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 1000 GeV2 and xGRV = 0.15, \u03c72 = 576 for 560\npoints).\nFinally, we can look at the PDF obtained from this model. As shown in\nFig. 3, the singlet quark distribution nearly does not depend on Q20 , which\nproves that the DGLAP equation constitutes a good numerical approximation\nto the triple-pole pomeron. For the gluon distribution, we see from Fig. 4 that\nthings are different. However, all these gluon distributions give acceptable F2\npredictions and differences in the gluon distribution between different Q20 must\ntherefore be considered as uncertainties.\n\n\f5\n\n4 CONCLUSION\n\n20\n\n40\n\n30\nQ2 = 10.000 GeV2\n\nQ2 = 27.219 GeV2\n\nQ2 = 74.089 GeV2\n\n15\n\n30\ng\n\n10\n\ng\n\ng\n\n20\n20\n\n10\n5\n0 -4\n10\n\n10\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\nx\n\n10-1\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n1\n\n50\n40\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\nx\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n60\nQ2 = 201.665 GeV2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n27.219\n\ng\n\ng\n\n10-2\nx\n\n10.000\n\n40\n\n20\n\n10-3\n\nQ02 values\n\nQ2 = 548.919 GeV2\n\n30\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n74.089\n\n20\n\n201.665\n\n10\n\n548.919\n0 -4\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\nx\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0 -4\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\nx\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\nFigure 4: Gluon distribution obtained with our method.\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nFirstly, we have seen that the Regge fit in [3] can be successfully extended to\nhigh values of Q2 using DGLAP evolution. In this method, quarks and gluons\nhave a common singularity structure, as requested by Regge theory.\nWe have then shown that, assuming that Regge theory extends to high values\nof Q2 , one can consider DGLAP evolution as a numerical approximation and use\nit to extract the residues of the triple-pole pomeron at high Q2 . This method\ngives large uncertainties on the gluon distribution at low x and low Q2 , which\nshould be of prime importance for LHC physics.\nIn the future, we plan to see if we can extend this method to x = 1 and\nto other Regge models. One should also try to find some modifications of the\nDGLAP equation stabilizing a triple-pole in j = 1.\nReferences\n[1] G. Soyez, Phys. Rev. D 67 (2003) 076001 [arXiv:hep-ph/0211361].\n[2] G.
