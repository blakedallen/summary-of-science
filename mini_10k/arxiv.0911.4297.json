INTRODUCTION\n\nSubmillimeter galaxies (SMG) are dust-obscured\nstarburst galaxies at high-redshift (Smail et al. 1997;\nHughes et al. 1998; Barger et al. 1998). Their large dynamical (Greve et al. 2005; Tacconi et al. 2006, 2008)\nand stellar masses (Borys et al. 2005; Dye et al. 2008), as\nwell as their number densities and clustering properties\n(Scott et al. 2002; Blain et al. 2004; Viero et al. 2009),\nsuggest they could be the progenitors of present-day\nluminous ellipticals (Lilly et al. 1999; Swinbank et al.\n2006). Some SMGs are known to be associated with\ngalaxy clusters at high redshifts (e.g. Webb et al. 2005)\nand to be located in extended overdensities of LBGs and\nradio galaxy fields (Ivison et al. 2000; Smail et al. 2003;\nStevens et al. 2003; Chapman et al. 2008; Daddi et al.\n2009; Tamura et al. 2009).\nIf SMGs are progenitors of massive clustered spheroids,\n\u2217 Based on observations obtained, within the COSMOS Legacy\nSurvey, with the IRAM 30 m , NRAO-VLA, HST, CFHT, Subaru,\nKPNO, CTIO, and ESO Observatories.

Attempts to measure the clustering of SMGs indicate that they are associated with massive dark matter halos and possibly trace\nthe largest scale structures at high redshifts (Blain et al.\n2004; Viero et al. 2009; Weiss et al. 2009). However, current submillimeter blank-field surveys either cover small\nareas in the sky, yielding a few tens of sources within contiguous fields (Coppin et al. 2006; Bertoldi et al. 2007;\nScott et al. 2008; Perera et al. 2008; Austermann et al.\n2009), or are limited by poor angular resolution albeit\ncovering large regions (Devlin et al. 2009). Hence, good\nquantitative studies of the small to large scale clustering\nof the SMG population are not feasible until large surveys comprising a few square degrees on the sky under\ngood resolution (. 20\u2032\u2032 ) can be made.\nStudies of the environment of SMGs are possible when\nutilizing the rich complementary data available for current (sub)millimeter fields. Whether SMGs are embedded in regions with an enhanced number of optical/nearIR detected high-redshift galaxies has yet not been quantified. In this paper, we investigate to what extent SMGs\nare located in clustered fields. For this, we make use\nof deep optical and near-IR imaging data in the central\npart of the COSMOS field to measure the density of highredshift BzK galaxies in the surroundings of SMGs. This\nallows us to study the relation of blank-field detected\nSMGs with the most prominent galaxy density peaks at\nhigh-redshift. Hereafter, we assume a cosmology with\nH0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and \u03a9M = 0.3 and\nuse all magnitudes in the AB system.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n2.1. COSMOS photometric data\nThe COSMOS survey (Scoville et al. 2007) covers a\nsufficiently large area ,1.4\u25e6 \u00d7 1.4\u25e6 , at appropriate depth\nover nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum to provide a comprehensive view of galaxy formation and large\n\n\f2\n\nAravena et al.\n\nFig. 1.- BzK diagram for MAMBO sources in the COSMOS\nfield.

The BzK loci for galaxies are shown\nas small crosses. Their color coding (orange, blue and black) is\nbased on the photometric redshifts (z > 1.4, z < 1.4 and stars,\nrespectively). The solid line separates star-forming galaxies at z >\n1.4, while the dashed line separates old passive evolving galaxies\nat z > 1.4. The dotted line separates stars (black) from a mixed\npopulation of galaxies at z < 1.4.\n\nscale structure.\nThe COSMOS i+ -band selected photometric catalog\nincludes a total of 30 narrow, intermediate and broad\nband filters covering from UV to mid-IR wavelengths\nthat allowed the computation of accurate photometric\nredshifts down to i+\nAB = 26.5 (see Ilbert et al. 2009;\nSalvato et al. 2009).\nA new deep K-band survey covering the entire COSMOS field was recently carried out by McCracken et al.\n(2009). The K-band image reaches seeing values of\n\u223c 0.7\u2032\u2032 with variations of less that \u223c 20% across the\nentire COSMOS field. The K-band selected catalog includes the B + , z + and i+ bands, reaching a completeness limit KAB \u2248 23.0 and a 1\u03c3 limit in the 2\u2032\u2032 diameter\naperture of 25.4 (for details see McCracken et al. 2009).\nAbout 85% of the sources detected in this K-band image\ndown to K = 23.0 have a photometric redshift estimate\nbased on the i+ -band photometric redshift catalog.\nThe optical/IR imaging was supplemented with deep\nVery Large Array (VLA) 1.4 GHz radio imaging\n(Schinnerer et al. 2004, 2007; Bondi et al. 2008) for the\nfull COSMOS area to an average rms level of 10 \u03bcJy at\na resolution of 1.5\u2032\u2032 .\n2.2. MAMBO 1.2 mm observations\n\nAn effective area of \u223c 22\u2032 \u00d7 22\u2032 of the COSMOS\nfield was mapped at 1.2 mm by Bertoldi et al. (2007)\nusing the Max-Planck millimeter bolometer camera\n(MAMBO) at the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\u00e9trique (IRAM) 30 m telescope. The COSMOS\nMAMBO (COSBO) survey is centered at (R.A., Dec.)\n= (10h 00m 30s , 02\u25e6 12\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 ) and reaches a noise level of\n1.0 mJy per 11\u2032\u2032 beam.\nFifteen millimeter sources were detected with a significance > 4\u03c3. Eleven of them were found to have\n\nFig. 2.- Top: Projected number density of high-redshift BzK\ngalaxies in the COSBO field (K < 23).

Additional 12\nlower significance sources (3.5\u22124.0\u03c3) were selected based\non their association with radio sources within 5\u2032\u2032 from\nthe millimeter position (Bertoldi et al. 2007). Two more\nMAMBO sources with S/N= 3 \u2212 4\u03c3 were selected based\non their match with significant 1.1 mm Bolocam (Aguirre\net al., in prep.) and radio sources.\n3. ENVIRONMENT OF SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES\n3.1. BzK selection\n\nThe BzK color-color criterion (Daddi et al. 2004) provides an efficient way to select galaxies in the crucial\nepoch when star-formation and SMG activity peaked\n(z = 1 \u2212 3).\nFigure 1 shows the BzK color-color diagram for the Kband selected counterparts to the MAMBO sources and\nfor objects with K < 23 in the COSBO field. Small corrections account for the difference between the VLT Bband used in the original BzK criterion and our BJ band\n(McCracken et al. 2009). According to this, sources with\nBzK \u2261 (z \u2212 K) \u2212 (B \u2212 z) > \u22120.2 are star-forming\n\n\fEnvironment of MAMBO galaxies in the COSMOS field\n\n3\n\ngalaxies at redshift > 1.4 (sBzK), while objects with\nBzK < \u22120.2 but (z \u2212 K) > 2.5 are old passively evolving galaxies at redshift > 1.4 (pBzK). Objects with\nBzK < \u22120.2 and (z \u2212 K) < 2.5 correspond to a mixture of old and star-forming galaxies at redshift < 1.4\n(nBzK). The restriction (z \u2212 K) < 0.3(B \u2212 z) \u2212 0.5\nallows the separation of stars.\nTo study the environment of the MAMBO galaxies, we\nused the BzK criteria to create a K-band selected galaxy\nsample containing a mixture of passive and star-forming\ngalaxies at high-redshift. We constrained our sample to\ninclude objects in the magnitude range K = 17 \u2212 23 and\nused the BzK criterion to reject stars.\nWe note that while the BzK criterion is very efficient\nselecting galaxies at z > 1.4, with \u223c 90% completeness\ndown to K = 23 (based on spectroscopic measurements;\nBarger et al. 2008), it still suffers a great degree of contamination (\u223c 36%), mostly from sources at z = 1.0\u22121.4\n(\u223c 30%; Barger et al. 2008). Only a small percentage\n(\u223c 10%) appears to lie at z < 1 and z > 3.\n\nTo estimate the probability P that an overdensity is\nfound by chance within a distance d from a MAMBO\ngalaxy, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of significant density peaks drawn by the underlying distribution\nof overdensities in the COSBO field.\nTo identify all the peaks in our density map, we used\nthe IDL version of the DAOPHOT task FIND. This routine finds the positive perturbations in the density map,\nand uses marginal Gaussian fits to locate the centroid\nand amplitude of the density peak. This Gaussian approximation may not be valid for fragmented density\nstructure, however it is reliable to detect the most significant overdensities which are typically non-fragmented.\nBased on this procedure, we found 45 detections with\nS/N> 4, nine of them with S/N& 10. Using their observed spatial distribution, we generated 45 peaks in each\nof the 10000 samplings, and thereby computed P as the\nfraction of SMG-overdensity associations in our simulations (Table 1). In the cases of COSBO 3, 6 and 16, the\nprobabilities of chance association are negligible.\n\n3.2. Projected density distribution\nWe constructed number density maps of high-redshift\nBzK galaxies in the COSBO field. For this, we created a\ngrid of 200 \u00d7 200 positions equally spaced by 7\u2032\u2032 centered\nat the COSBO field position, and computed the density from the distance to the 7th nearest neighbour BzK\ngalaxy, d7 , to each grid point. The density is thereby\ncomputed as n7 = 7/\u03c0(d7 )2 .\nThis procedure is similar to the one introduced by\nDressler (1980). The choice of 7 is a compromise between accounting for structures on small scales (groups of\n& 4 galaxies around SMGs) and good statistics for each\ndensity value. Similar approaches have been applied to\nknown rich galaxy clusters (e.g. Guzzo et al. 2007), but\nusing photometric or spectroscopic information to compute the number density in redshift slices.\nFigure 2 shows the projected number density map of\nhigh-redshift BzK galaxies in the COSBO field. The\naverage and standard deviation values were computed\nby using all grid points from our density map (Fig. 2).\nThe average density thus computed is 7.0 \u00b1 4.6 arcmin\u22122\n(K < 23.0), where the quoted uncertainty corresponds to\nthe actual cosmic variance. Down to K = 21.8, we find\nan average density of 1.5\u00b11.0 arcmin\u22122 , which compares\nwell with the number counts of high-redshift BzK galaxies in other surveys at this depth (Kong et al. 2006).\nWe find that four MAMBO galaxies (COSBO 1, 3, 6\nand 16) are embedded in significant overdensities (> 4\u03c3)\nof high-redshift BzK galaxies. All the galaxies in these\noverdensities are star-forming rather than passive evolving galaxies. Three out of these four SMGs were detected\nwith S/N> 4 in the MAMBO map (Bertoldi et al. 2007).\nThe overdensities of galaxies around MAMBO sources\ncan also be seen directly on the optical and IR images\n(Fig. 3). Here, red galaxies are easily distinguished,\nshowing an excess toward the MAMBO source position\n(image center). The typical radial extent of these overdensities is \u223c 5\u221210\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 20\u2032\u2032 in diameter). At a redshift of\n\u223c 2, this implies structures on scales of \u223c 170 kpc, similar to what has been found for QSO and radio galaxy\nfields (Hall & Green 1998; Best 2000).\n\n3.4. Photometric redshifts and comments on individual\n\n3.3. Probability of chance association\n\nassociations\nTo measure the clustering of the star-forming highredshift galaxies associated with SMGs in redshift space,\nwe used the COSMOS i+ -band selected photometric redshift catalog (Ilbert et al. 2009). The accuracy of these\nphotometric redshifts for faint galaxies (i+ & 25.5) is\n\u03c3 \u223c 0.2.\nFigure 4 shows the redshift distribution of K-band selected galaxies that lie close to the high-redshift BzK\ndensity peaks associated with SMGs. Since the i+ -band\ncatalog is too shallow to include the obscured optical\nemission from the MAMBO galaxies, we used the previous photometric redshift estimates from Bertoldi et al.\n(2007).\nFor COSBO-1, a recent Submillimetre Array (SMA)\ndetection (which will be published elsewhere) indicates\nthat the millimeter emission is produced by a radio and optically undetected galaxy at z > 3.5 (as\nalso implied by its radio-to-millimeter spectral index;\nBertoldi et al. 2007). The counterpart to this MAMBO\nsource selected by Bertoldi et al. (2007), a relatively\nbright IRAC/optical source with a photometric redshift\nof \u2248 1.2, is related to the galaxy group at this redshift.\nHowever, it is very probably not responsible for the millimeter emission. The association between this source\nand the overdensity is unlikely, Pd \u223c 0.05. Hence, we\ndiscard this one as a real association between a SMG and\na galaxy group at z \u223c 1.5. In cases when the group is at\nlow-redshift, gravitational lensing of a far-away SMG is\na possibility.\nFor COSBO-3, the redshift distribution of the galaxies in its close neighbourhood is consistent with most of\nthem being at z \u223c 2.2 \u2212 2.4 (Fig. 4). Two radio sources\ncan be identified within 10\u2032\u2032 from the MAMBO source.\nThe most likely radio/IR/optical counterpart (COSBO3S) has a photometric redshift of 2.3 (Bertoldi et al.\n2007). Based on the i+ -band selected catalog, we find\na redshift of 2.4 for this source, consistent with the likely\nredshift of the galaxy group. Recent CARMA observations indicate the MAMBO emission is produced by at\nleast two sources (Sm\u01d2lci\u0107 et al., in prep.).\nMost galaxies in the group around COSBO-6 lie at\n\n\f4\n\nAravena et al.\nTABLE 1\nAssociations between high-redshift BzK galaxy overdensities with millimeter sources\nID\nCOSBO-1\nCOSBO-3\nCOSBO-6\nCOSBO-16\n\nR.A.a\n\nDec.a\n\n(J2000)\n150.0679 2.26209\n150.2379 2.33649\n150.0357 2.21871\n150.2360 2.14549\n\nNb\n\n30\u2032\u2032\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nS/N c\n4.6\n27.8\n22.9\n7.2\n\ndd\n\nPe\n\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\n30\u2032\u2032\n\u00d710\u22122\n\n13.8\n2.8\n4.6\n6.5\n\n18.5\n3.9\n12.3\n12.7\n\nPdf\n\ng\nzmedian\n\nh\nzSMG\n\n2.0\n2.3\n1.6\n1.5\n\n1.2\n2.3\n1.9\n0.5\n\n\u00d710\u22122\n4.7\n0.05\n0.2\n0.7\n\na\n\nPosition of the density peak. b Number of high-redshift BzK galaxies within 30\u2032\u2032 . c Peak signal-to-noise (S/N ) of the density peak. d\nDistance from the COSBO source to the density peak. e&f Probability that a significant overdensity lies by chance within a distance of\n30\u2032\u2032 and of d\u2032\u2032 from the MAMBO source.g Median photometric redshift for BzK galaxies within 30\u2032\u2032 . h Photometric redshift for the SMG\nfrom Bertoldi et al.

Although the\nredshift for the likely counterpart is slightly larger than\nthe one implied by the redshift distribution of the surrounding high-redshift BzK galaxies, it agrees within\n\u2206z = 0.2.\nThe galaxies surrounding COSBO-16 have a photometric redshift of \u223c 1.4. The photometric redshift derived\nfor the likely radio/optical counterpart from the i+ -band\nselected catalog is \u2248 0.5 (Bertoldi et al. 2007), however\nthe secondary solution (second minima in the \u03c72 distribution) implies z \u223c 1.4. The photometric redshift listed in\nthe COSMOS catalog is, however, 2.55 which agrees better with that implied by the radio to millimeter spectral\nindex (Bertoldi et al. 2007). Because of the somewhat\nambiguous redshift derivation for the millimeter source,\nit is difficult to relate it to the redshift peak in the surrounding galaxies, although we may slightly favor to use\nz = 1.4 as the most likely case for both.\n4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe find that significant overdensities of star-forming\nhigh-redshift galaxies are related to three MAMBO\ngalaxies detected in the COSMOS field. These groups\nare compact in size, and the peaks of their redshift distributions are compatible with the redshift estimated for\nthe associated MAMBO galaxies.\n4.1. SMGs in dense environments\nIf SMGs are related to the formation of structures at\nhigh-redshift, we would expect that most SMGs are located in regions with enhanced galaxy densities. However, only a few SMGs in our sample can be associated\n\nwith strong galaxy overdensities. This could be partly\nattributed to a selection effect, since we are comparing\nthe overall population of SMGs at various redshifts with\nK-band selected galaxies in the range z \u223c 1.4 \u2212 2.5. According to Chapman et al. (2005), \u223c 55% of the radioidentified, bright SMG population lies in this redshift\nrange. From our sample of fifteen MAMBO sources detected with a significance > 4\u03c3, eleven were identified to\nhave a radio counterpart. Following Chapman et al., we\nestimate that about six of these eleven MAMBO sources\nshould be at z = 1.4 \u2212 2.5, while using the photometric\nredshifts reported by Bertoldi et al. (2007), seven appear\nto lie in this redshift range. This implies that \u223c30%\nof the radio-identified, significant MAMBO sources at\nz = 1.4 \u2212 2.5 are associated with substancial overdensities of massive galaxies at these redshifts.\nNote that our study is biased in that we are selecting\nmassive galaxies at z = 1.4 \u2212 2.5. Our K < 23 limit\nroughly translates into stellar masses & (2\u22124)\u00d71010 M\u2299\n(Daddi et al. 2004), and therefore we miss less massive\ngalaxies that could be associated with SMGs at these\nredshifts. However, the fact remains that only a fraction\nof the SMGs are related to groups of massive galaxies in\nthe crucial epoch of galaxy assembly.\nWe compared the distribution of densities at the position of > 4\u03c3 MAMBO source detections with the distribution of densities of BzK galaxies in the field (Fig.\n2). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test does not reject the\nnull hypothesis that both samples follow the same distribution at a 46% significance level. Restricting the > 4\u03c3\nMAMBO source sample to sources at z = 1.4 \u2212 2.5, the\nKS test does not reject the null hypothesis at a 43% level.\nThis is somewhat inconsistent with the fact that two of\nthe brightest MAMBO galaxies are related to some of\n\n\fEnvironment of MAMBO galaxies in the COSMOS field\n\n5\n\nthe whole COSBO area. Denser groups of star-forming\nBzK galaxies are more likely to produce major mergers\nbetween galaxies and thus are prone to trigger violent\nstar-formation activity. The merger of two gas-rich BzK\ngalaxies close to the center of a galaxy group could induce\na starburst that would be seen as a bright SMG. Starforming BzK galaxies have large reservoirs of molecular\ngas (\u223c 1011 M\u2299 ; Daddi et al. 2008), and could easily sustain the typical star-formation rates observed in SMGs\n(\u223c 1000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) for . 100 Myr. The densest galaxy\ngroups are thus ideal for the formation of bright submillimeter activity.\nFig. 4.- Redshift distribution for galaxies located within 30\u2032\u2032\nfrom the density peak of high-redshift galaxies near MAMBO\nsources. The dotted histogram shows the photometric redshifts for\nour K-band selected galaxies, the dark-gray histogram shows the\nredshifts for the K-band selected high-redshift BzK galaxies and\nthe black single object shows the redshift of the most likely counterpart to the MAMBO source as given by Bertoldi et al. (2007).\nFor COSBO-16, the hashed entry represents the secondary solution\nfrom the photometric redshift computation.\n\nthe strongest overdensities in the field, however it may\nmerely reflect the low number of SMGs that we used to\ncompute the KS statistic. For the 3.5 \u2212 4.0\u03c3 MAMBO\nsource sample, the KS-test does not rule out the null hypothesis at a 23% level, whereas if we limit this sample\nto galaxies with z = 1.4 \u2212 2.5, the KS test gives a 3.4%\nsignificance level. This strongly suggests that the densities at the position of the fainter MAMBO sources follow\na different distribution from that of BzK galaxies in the\nfield. For both samples combined (all MAMBO sources),\nthe KS test gives only a 9.6% probability that they follow the same distribution of densities of BzK galaxies in\nthe field, which is similar to the value that we obtain\nif we restrict the sample to z = 1.4 \u2212 2.5, 12.6%, again\nsuggesting that the distributions are different.\nOverall, our results show that only a fraction (30%) of\nMAMBO sources at z = 1.4 \u2212 2.5 is located in strongly\noverdense regions. This suggests that only some SMGs\nare linked to the formation of structures at high-redshift.\nAlthough we find a hint that some SMGs could be located\nin environments denser than that of the general population of galaxies at z \u223c 2, it is not possible to discern\nwhether this is a real trend or is due to cosmic variance\nas our analysis is based only on a handful of SMGs.\nThe presence of bright SMGs in galaxy overdensities\nis possibly related to the fact that the density peaks\nof high-redshift BzK galaxies associated with MAMBO\ngalaxies (e.g. for COSBO-3 and 6) are the strongest in\n\n4.2. Comparison with other studies\n\nSimilar studies relating the distribution of SMGs with\nthe large scale structures traced by optically selected\ngalaxies at high-redshift have recently been done. In particular, Tamura et al. (2009) found a strong overdensity\nof SMGs toward a massive protocluster of Lyman-\u03b1 emitters at z = 3.1, reflecting a strong link between SMGs\nand the large scale structure. Nevertheless, this study is\nbased on a proto-cluster field where we know that strong\nclustering is taking place.\nStudies of the galaxy-galaxy angular correlation function in blank-fields indicate that SMGs and IR luminous\ngalaxies at z \u223c 2 are clustered on typical angular scales\nof 15 \u2212 25\u2032\u2032 , being related to massive dark matter halos (\u223c 1013 M\u2299 ; Blain et al. 2004; Greve et al. 2004;\nScott et al. 2006; Farrah et al. 2006; Viero et al. 2009;\nWeiss et al. 2009). Our results are consistent with these\nresults in that strong clustering between SMGs and BzK\ngalaxies occur on similar angular scales. We note, however, that studies purely based on the angular two-point\ncorrelation function are only able to measure the average\nclustering properties of SMGs. They miss the important\nfact that not all the SMGs are located in clustered environments, as we find in this paper, and therefore only a\nfew of them will significantly contribute to the clustering\nsignal of the angular correlation function in small scales.\nM.
