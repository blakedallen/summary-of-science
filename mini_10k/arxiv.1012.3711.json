The Ryle Telescope (RT), which carried out\nthe survey, has subsequently been reconfigured and re-equipped\nto form the Large Array (LA) of the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI; AMI Consortium: Zwart et al. 2008). As part of this\nmetamorphosis, three of the RT's eight antennas were moved to\nthe north of the (almost) east-west line on which they originally\nstood, providing the telescope with north-south baselines. In addition, new front-end receivers and back-end electronics, including a\nnew correlator, were installed. The result is a telescope with much\nlarger bandwidth and improved flux-density sensitivity, allowing\nus to extend our 15-GHz-band survey work to much deeper fluxdensity levels.\n\u22c6\n\nWe request that any reference to this paper cites 'AMI Consortium:\nFranzen et al. 2010'\n\u2020 Email: t.franzen@mrao.cam.ac.uk\n\u2021 Email: m.davies@mrao.cam.ac.uk\nc 2010 RAS\n\nThe 9C survey was conceived to provide information regarding the foreground radio sources that contaminated the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation observations of the Very Small Array (Watson et al. 2003). Similarly, the 10C source survey has been\ndesigned to complement the other AMI science programmes, which\nalso require knowledge of contaminating radio sources.\nThis paper is focussed on the techniques employed for observing, mapping and source extraction in the 10C survey. In an accompanying paper (AMI Consortium: Davies et al. 2010, hereafter\nPaper II) the first results from the 10C survey, including the deep\n15.7-GHz source count, are presented.\n\n2 THE ARCMINUTE MICROKELVIN IMAGER LARGE\nARRAY\nThe AMI consists of two separate telescopes \u2013 the LA and Small\nArray (SA). The 10C-survey data were collected using only the LA.\nBefore proceeding further, the LA's vital statistics are summarised.\nThe LA is an interferometer comprising eight 13-metrediameter, equatorially-mounted dishes, with a range of baselines of\n\n\f2\n\nAMI Consortium: Franzen et al.\n\n18\u2013110 m. It operates at frequencies between 13.9 and 18.2 GHz\nwith the passband divided into six channels of 0.72-GHz bandwidth. It has a primary beam at \u2248 15.7 GHz of \u2248 5.5 arcmin\nfull width at half-maximum (FWHM) and a typical resolution of\n\u2248 30 arcsec (this varies depending on the precise uv-coverage of\nany observation). The telescope measures a single, linear polarisation (Stokes I + Q) and has a flux-density sensitivity of \u2248 3 mJy for\nan integration time of one second.\nAccurate pointing is important for high-frequency observations because of the relatively small telescope primary beams for\nsuch observations. The LA pointing is calibrated using five-point\nobservations of bright point sources, which are carried out on a\nmonthly basis. The data from five-point observations are used to\nconstruct a pointing model which provides the HA and Dec. offset\nof each antenna at any point in the sky. After applying these empirical corrections to the data, there is a residual rms antenna pointing\nerror of \u2248 30 arcsec. In practice, this is small enough compared\nwith the primary beam size to have no significant effect on the accuracy of source flux densities measured from the raster maps.\n\nTable 1.

The\nmajority of these sources are found in the catalogue of the JodrellVLA Astrometic Survey (JVAS; Patnaik et al. 1992; Browne et al.\n1998; Wilkinson et al. 1998) and are used for phase and amplitude\ncalibration of the data.\nThe LA is not yet sufficiently stable to rely on daily LA measurements of the primary calibrator sources for flux-density calibration, and so the secondary calibrators are used for flux-density\ncalibration. The flux densities, in each channel, assumed for these\nsecondary calibrator sources are obtained from SA measurements.\nThe closest (in time) SA observation of the source is selected and\nthe flux densities measured in each channel are adopted as the assumed values for calibrating the LA observation. As many of the\nsecondary calibrator sources have varying flux densities, the SA\nobservations are made within 10 days of the relevant LA observation. In turn, the SA observations are calibrated by using SA observations of the AMI primary calibration sources \u2013 3C286 and 3C48\n\u2013 each of which are usually observed daily.\nThe flux densities assumed for 3C286 and 3C48, in each of\nthe AMI frequency channels, are shown in Table 1. The flux densities for 3C286 were converted from total-intensity measurements\nprovided by R. Perley (private communication) and made by the\nVery Large Array, and are consistent with the Rudy et al. (1987)\nmodel of Mars transferred on to absolute scale, using results from\nthe Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. Values for 3C48 were\nobtained by measuring the ratios of the flux densities of 3C48 to\n3C286 using SA observations carried out between 2008 January\nand 2010 May.\nFinally, in order to account for phase errors, a correction factor\nof 1.082 is applied to raster flux densities. This correction factor\nwas determined using self-calibrated maps of \u2248 50 of the brightest\nsources in the survey fields \u2013 the data were collected using pointed\nobservations, which were carried out to check the raster maps' fluxdensity scale and are described in Paper II.\n\nFigure 1. Noise map for one of the 10C fields. Lighter shades indicate lower\nnoise areas.\n\n4 OBSERVATIONS AND RASTERING TECHNIQUES\nThe 10C survey covers a total area of \u2248 27 deg2 divided into\n10 fields. The area within the FWHM of the LA primary beam\n(\u2248 0.005 deg2 ) is a small fraction of the total survey area. As a\nresult, a rastering technique, similar to that used for the 9C survey,\nhas been used.\nEach survey field is observed using a set of telescope pointings which lie on a 2-D hexagonally-gridded lattice, projected on\nto the plane of the sky. The fields are observed with the lattice rows\nrunning along lines of constant declination at date. Since the telescope is equatorially mounted, this is the natural way to observe in\norder to minimise time lost to slewing between pointings.\nMaps are created for each of the pointings and combined\nas described below. No attempt has been made to recover spatial\nscales larger than the primary beam by jointly deconvolving data\nfrom separate pointings and, in this respect, the mosaicing technique employed here is different from that of Cornwell (1988) and\nSault et al. (1996).\nThe spacing between pointing centres was chosen as 4 arcmin,\nas this was found (initially from simulations, but also in practice) to\nprovide an acceptable compromise between the desire to minimise\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\f10C Survey \u2013 Data Analysis\n\n5 MAPPING\nRaw data files from individual observing runs had various checks\nand calibrations applied using in-house, data-reduction software,\nreduce. A fuller explanation of the steps carried out in reduce, including the weighting of data depending on the weather conditions,\ncan be found in AMI Consortium: Davies et al. (2009). The data\nwere then output as multisource uv-fits files, which were, in turn,\ncombined into a single multisource uv-fits file per field, again using\nin-house software.\nDepending on the precise nature of the flagging applied, it is\npossible that data belonging to individual telescope pointings are\nconstituted from different frequency channels in slightly varying\nproportions. As a consequence, when the data were combined into\na single uv-fits file, the data weights were adjusted, on a pointing\nby pointing basis, so that the continuum maps would always have\nthe same centre frequency: 15.7 GHz. This causes a small loss of\nsensitivity.\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\nKilo Wavlngth\n\nvariations in sensitivity across the final map (achieved by increasing the number of pointing directions) and to minimise observing\ntime lost to telescope slewing.\nThe spacing between pointing centres chosen for the 10C survey (4.0 arcmin) is smaller than for the 9C survey (5.0 arcmin)\nin consequence of the LA's higher maximum observing frequency\ncompared to the RT. Had the same spacing been used the variation in sensitivity across the raster maps at the high-frequency-end\nof the AMI observing band would have been unacceptably greater\nthan that on the RT raster maps (owing to the scaling of the primary\nbeam with frequency).\nThe time spent observing each field has been apportioned so as\nto create two distinct levels: the 'central', with lower noise, and the\n'outer', with a noise level about twice that of the central level. This\nscheme dovetails well with the SA observing programme. Surveying the outer areas to higher flux-density levels is also advantageous\nfrom the point of view of improving the source-count statistics at\nthe brighter end of the survey. Fig. 1 shows the noise map for one\nof the 10C survey fields. The outer and central areas are readily\napparent.\nEach of the fields was divided into smaller 'sub-fields', which\ncome in two varieties: 'extended' which, taken together, cover the\nentirety of the field and 'core' which lie on the central area. Since\nthe fields have different sizes, the number of pointings within each\nsub-field and the number of sub-fields vary between fields \u2013 the\ncore sub-fields range between 54 and 72, and the extended between\n110 and 200, pointings.\nThe sub-fields were each observed several times, typically for\n\u2248 10 h at a time, until the desired noise levels were reached. The\ntelescope dwell time per pointing was 30 s for the extended and\n60 s for the core sub-fields. The dwell times were chosen so that\nin an observing run of typical length, each pointing was visited\nseveral times, serving to improve the uv-coverage. Fig. 2 shows the\nuv-coverage for a typical pointing in a final raster map. Owing to\nflagging of the data, for example due to poor weather conditions\nduring observing, the noise was sometimes found to be higher than\ndesired over small areas of the final map; these areas were targeted\nwith additional, small rasters or with individual pointings to ensure\nmore uniform coverage over the field.\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\nKilo Wavlngth\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\nFigure 2. The uv-coverage for a typical pointing in the core area of the\nfinal raster; data from all individual observations of this pointing have been\ncombined.\n\nThe uv-fits data were exported into the aips1 package and individual, continuum maps created for each telescope pointing using\nthe imagr task. Each component map is 512 by 512 pixels, where\nthe pixels are 5 \u00d7 5 arcsec2 in size. Natural weighting was used to\nmaximise signal-to-noise.\nEach component map was cleaned using an elliptical Gaussian fitted to the central region of the dirty beam as the restoring\nbeam. As a result, the restoring beam for each component map is\nslightly different \u2013 the implications of this for source extraction are\ndiscussed in Section 6.3. cleaning was stopped after the first negative clean component was reached, as real negative features are\nnot expected to be present in the 10C maps. Negative clean components are in some cases necessary to best recover the true sky\nbrightness distribution. However, we have chosen to adopt a conservative approach in order to avoid the so-called 'clean bias' (aips\ncookbook; www.aoc.nrao.edu/aips/cook.html), where real source\nflux is underestimated as a result of attributing clean components\nto noise fluctuations. The noise on each component map was then\nestimated using the imean task, which fits a Gaussian, centred on\nzero, to the distribution of pixel values.\nFollowing a method similar to that of Waldram et al. (2003),\nthe component maps were combined to form a single 'raster' map\nfor each field, using the flatn task. Only data above the 0.1 powerpoint of the primary beam from each component map were used.\nThe mapping was also attempted using a cut-off of 0.3, since the\nuncertainties in the primary beam increase with distance from its\ncentre. However, this was found to produce significant discontinuities in the map, which in turn caused spurious source detections\n(see Section 8). Using a cut-off of 0.1 is found to make negligible difference to the source flux-densities and to the map noise and\navoids the problem of sharp discontinuities in the map.

In particular, they are found to provide a better estimate\nof the true thermal noise close to sources, than would be found by\nconsidering the pixel values in the vicinity of sources on the real\nmaps. Noise estimates computed using the latter method tend to be\nbiased high.\nGiven the 4.0-arcmin spacing of the pointing centres and the\n0.1 cutoff of the primary beam, if the noise level, \u03c3c , was the same\non each component map then the noise in the main area of the raster\nmap would vary between \u2248 0.86\u03c3c and \u2248 0.90\u03c3c . Fig. 3 is a small\nsection of the noise map for one of the survey fields and shows the\nstructure of the noise. There is necessarily a sharp increase in the\nnoise at the edges of the map, as seen in Fig. 1.\n\n6 SOURCE EXTRACTION\nSources are detected in each survey field through analysis of the\nrelevant raster map. For the 9C survey, candidate sources were followed up with pointed observations to allow identification of genuine sources. Observational time constraints meant that it was not\npossible to follow up each 10C source with a dedicated pointed\nobservation. However, the 10C-survey noise maps provide much\nbetter estimates of the noise variation across the survey maps than\nwere available as part of the 9C survey. Therefore, the noise maps\nwere used to assess the reliability of each detection. Nevertheless,\nas described in Paper II, pointed observations were carried out towards \u2248 50 of the brightest sources detected as part of the survey,\nproviding a vital check of the raster maps' flux-density scale.\nIn this section the steps in building a source catalogue are described. The methods employed are able to deal with noise levels\n\nSource finding is carried out for each survey field making use of\nthe noise map, which allows sources to be identified on the basis\nof their signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). If one wishes to search for\nsources above \u03b3\u03c3n , where \u03c3n is the value of the noise map at the\npixel position and \u03b3 is a constant usually chosen to be 5.0, an initial search for pixels greater than 0.6\u03b3\u03c3n is conducted. The value\nof 0.6 was found to be sufficiently low so as to identify all peaks\nthat have values greater than \u03b3\u03c3n after pixel interpolation. Pixels\nselected must have values greater than or equal to the surrounding eight pixels. Pixels at the map boundary are not considered as\npotential sources.\nSince the synthesised beam is fully sampled (\u223c 6 pixels per\nFWHM of the beam), for each candidate source a peak value, corresponding to a position interpolated between the grid points, is\ncalculated. This is done by calculating the local map values on a\nsuccessively finer grid (up to 128 times finer), by repeated convolution with a Gaussian-graded sinc function of the form\n( sin(\u03c0x)\nexp(\u22120.275x2 ) if |x| 6 3\n\u03c0x\nf (x) =\n(1)\n0\notherwise,\nwhere x has units of pixels (Rees 1990). Interpolated peak values\nthat are greater than or equal to \u03b3\u03c3n are stored.\nAt this stage, the entries in the catalogue are S pk (the interpolated peak flux density), and \u03b1pk and \u03b4pk (the interpolated peak\nposition). The errors, \u03b4S pk , on the source peak-flux-densities are\nalso provided. They are assumed to consist of a 5 per cent calibration error added in quadrature with the thermal noise estimate,\nbecause these are uncorrelated. Thus, the total error is \u03b4S pk =\np\n\u03c32n + (0.05S pk )2 . The source names contained in the catalogue are\nconstructed from their respective coordinates.\n\n6.2 Identifying overlapping/complex sources\nFollowing a method similar to that of Waldram & Riley (1993), inhouse software is used to identify overlapping sources. The integration area of a source is taken to consist of contiguous pixels down\nto a lowest contour level of 2.5\u03c3n . We begin by measuring the integration area of the source with the lowest value of \u03c3n . The source is\nclassified as 'single' if its integration area contains no other peaks.\nWhere more than one peak lies within the integration area, they are\nall classified as 'overlapping' and the name of the brightest peak, as\nwell as the number of peaks, contained within the area are inserted\nin the 'group' column.\nThe above procedure is repeated for each of the sources that\nremain unclassified, in order of increasing \u03c3n . Considering the\nsources in this order avoids sources being classified as single when\nthey actually lie within the 2.5\u03c3n contour of another source.\nSources can be separated by several synthesised beam widths,\nyet still share the same integration area because of the presence\nof faint extended emission linking them. Overlapping sources are\ntherefore a good indicator of complex structure as well as point\nsources close together on the sky.\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\f10C Survey \u2013 Data Analysis\n6.3 Gaussian-fitting\nNext, the aips task, jmfit is used to fit a 2D elliptical Gaussian,\nby an iterative least-squares process, to each source. Angular sizes\nand integrated flux densities can be estimated from these Gaussian\nfits. For each source, the fitted Gaussian is compared to the pointsource response. This enables the morphology of resolved sources\nto be characterised. This also provides a check for 'over-narrow'\nsources, which appear significantly smaller than the point-source\nresponse and are likely to be spurious. Such 'sources' can be caused\nby discontinuities in the map, for instance at the boundary of a constituent map. According to Condon (1997) they can also occur at\nthe positions of noise bumps and between the peaks of overlapping\nor complex sources.\nThe comparison is complicated by the fact that the restoring\nbeam is slightly different for each component map, as explained in\nSection 5. As most points on the raster map result from a combination of several constituent maps, the point-source response varies\nacross the raster and cannot, in general, be characterised by a single\n2-D elliptical Gaussian. In principle, this problem could be avoided\nby regrading the constituent maps with a single beam, having dimensions that encompass all the individual restoring beams. However, since in practice the beam areas vary significantly \u2013 by up\nto a factor of 2.24 for the most extreme field \u2013 this approach has\nnot been adopted, as this would lead to a substantial loss of resolution. Rather, the point-source response belonging to the pointing\nwith the highest weight at the position of the source is used in the\ncomparison, as this proves to be a good approximation for the great\nmajority of sources.\nDue to the large number of sources detected in the 10C survey, the Gaussian-fitting has been automated. Six parameters are\nfitted for each single source: the peak value, peak RA and Dec.,\nmajor axis, minor axis and position angle of the major axis. The\nfitting area consists of pixels inside a square centred on the source\n(peak) with a half-width of six pixels. Given the pixel size, this is\nsufficiently large to encompass point sources (for point sources at\nlow SNR the 2.5-\u03c3n integration area is not sufficiently large). An\nexception is made if part of the integration area lies outside the\nbox, in which case the size of the box is increased such that it encompasses the integration area, allowing correct fitting of extended\nsources. The fitted parameters are initialised as S pk , \u03b1pk , \u03b4pk , bmaj ,\nbmin and b\u03b8 (bmaj , bmin and b\u03b8 are the parameters of the restoring\nbeam belonging to the pointing with the highest weight at the position of the source). A maximum number of 25 iterations is allowed\nto reach convergence. Even at low SNR, in real maps very few\nsources did not converge within this number of iterations. Those\nsources that failed to converge were found to lie on the sidelobes\nof bright sources and were often overlapping \u2013 they were excluded\nfrom the catalogue.\nFor overlapping sources of N components, N Gaussians are\nfitted simultaneously. The peak value, peak position, major axis,\nminor axis and position angle of the major axis of each component\nare allowed to vary. The fitting area consists of pixels within a box\nencompassing N squares with half-widths of six pixels, one centred\non each source (peak). Again, an exception is made if part of the\nintegration area lies outside the box, in which case the size of the\nbox is increased such that it encompasses the integration area. The\nvalues of S pk , \u03b1pk , \u03b4pk , bmaj , bmin and b\u03b8 for each source are used to\ninitialise the fit. A maximum number of 25N iterations is allowed\nto reach convergence.\nProviding that the Gaussian-fitting achieves convergence, an\nintegrated flux density, S in , is obtained. This is given by the peak\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

For complex sources that are many times the size of the synthesised beam,\na more accurate integrated flux density can be obtained simply\nby summing pixel values from the peak down to some SNR, normalising with respect to the beam. However, this method has not\nbeen implemented here, since there are no believable sources in the\n10C survey for which the Gaussian-fitting does not converge. The\nGaussian-fitting also provides useful additional information.\nIn addition, \u03b1in and \u03b4in , the fitted peak position is recorded.\nFollowing the method of Condon (1997), who has derived approximate and semi-empirical expressions for Gaussian-fitting errors in\nimages with correlated noise, jmfit also provides an estimate of the\nerror, \u03c3in , on S in , due to the thermal noise. The thermal noise, \u03c3n , is\nused by the task in estimating \u03c3\nqin . Following Section 6.1, the total\n\nerror on S in is taken as \u03b4S in = \u03c32in + (0.05S in )2 .\nAn estimate of the source size is obtained by deconvolving the\npoint-source response from the fitted Gaussian (both represented by\n2-D elliptical Gaussians). The sky brightness distribution is represented by the resulting 2-D elliptical Gaussian, the major and minor\naxes, emaj and emin , and position angle, e\u03b8 , of which are measured.\nFor a point source in the limit of an infinite SNR this Gaussian will\nconverge to a delta function. However, in the presence of noise the\nmajor axis will tend to be biased high (have a value greater than 0)\nand the minor axis low. In practice, axes for which the fitted value\nis negative are set to zero, as negative physical source sizes are not\nplausible. Table 2 summarises the interpretation of the major and\nminor axes, after deconvolution.\nThe results of the deconvolution can be used to classify each\nsource as point-like or extended. The classification criteria are justified fully in Section 7. Briefly, the source is classed as extended\nif emaj is greater than or equal to some critical value, ecrit , given by\nEquation 4.\nThe catalogue entries for the Gaussian-fitting are, therefore,\n\u03b1in , \u03b4in , S in , \u03b4S in , ecrit , emaj , emin and e\u03b8 . A flag, t, is also included\nto denote one of two source types: point-like (P) or extended (E).\nAs an additional check, for each source, the integrated flux density\nis normalised using the weighted sum of the areas of the pointsource responses which contribute at the position of the source. If\nthe resultant integrated flux density lies outside the range (S in \u2212\n\u03b4S in ) to (S in + \u03b4S in ) then a '*' is inserted in the 'flag' column. This\nindicates that the results obtained from the Gaussian-fitting must\nbe treated with caution, since the error from the approximation of\nthe point-source response is significant. In practice, this has been\nfound to be the case for less than 1 per cent of sources above 5\u03c3\ndetected in all survey fields.\n\n\f6\n\nAMI Consortium: Franzen et al.\n7 CLASSIFYING SOURCES AS POINT-LIKE OR\nEXTENDED\n31 32\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n30\n\n28\n\n26\n\n24\n\n22\n00 22 45\n\n30\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n15\n\nFigure 4.

Source positions (\u03b1pk ,\u03b4pk ) found with\n\u03b3 = 5.0 are represented as crosses.\n\nAs noted in Section 6.3, criteria for classifying sources as pointlike or extended have been developed. One approach would be to\nuse the residuals from 3-parameter fits, where only the peak brightness, and peak RA and Dec. are allowed to vary, to identify extended sources; for extended sources the fit is expected to be poor.\nHowever, even for point sources the quality of the fit will vary with\nSNR and quantifying this dependence is difficult. An empirical approach might be possible. However, a method, based on theory,\nwhich makes use of the angular size after deconvolution has been\nfound to provide a straightforward test applicable to a wide range\nof SNRs.\nMaps containing point sources and noise were simulated in\norder to investigate the distribution of emaj that would be expected\nfor point sources as a function of SNR. Simulated visibilities were\ngenerated for point sources using uv-coverage from real observations of a survey field. After simulating the sources and noise in\nthe uv-plane, the resultant multisource uv-fits file was mapped as\ndescribed in Section 5 and source extraction was carried out as in\nSection 6.\nPoint sources were simulated in the uv-plane using a real multisource uv-fits file as a template.

A subset of the catalogue entries for the sources detected\nin this region are provided in Table 3.

Beyond this distance its\ncontribution was negligible owing to the fall-off in the primary\nbeam. Gaussian noise was also simulated, such that the noise on\neach of the component maps was identical, by adding random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution to the real and imaginary\nparts of each visibility.\nWe note that point sources can alternatively be inserted into\nreal raster maps by adding Vi j to real multisource uv data. Such\nsimulations were carried out in order to assess the completeness of\nthe 10C survey (see Paper II).\nOur source extraction techniques were applied to a map of\n3.2 deg2 containing 780, 100-mJy, simulated point sources \u2013 one\nat each pointing centre.

Fig. 9 shows how\necrit varies with SNR for bmaj = 37.5 arcsec.\nThe method for distinguishing between point and extended\nsources can be used to establish how best to measure the total flux\ndensity of a source. Clearly, S in should be used to estimate the total\nflux density of an extended source. Both S pk and S in can be used to\ndescribe a point source. However, at low SNR, the results obtained\nusing S in will be significantly less accurate given the fact that the\nsource is not assumed to be point-like when measuring S in . In summary, S pk should be used to describe all sources except those that\nare classified as extended, for which S in should be used.\n\n8 APPLICATION OF SOURCE EXTRACTION\nTECHNIQUES TO REAL DATA\nTo illustrate the source extraction procedures outlined above they\nwere applied to one of the survey fields, covering an area of about\n2.5 deg2 ; the results are presented here. The noise levels in the\ncore and extended field areas are typically 50 and 100 \u03bcJy respectively. In total, 158 sources were detected above 5\u03c3, of which 10\nare classed as overlapping.\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 9.

Comparison of integrated flux densities with peak flux densities\nfor sources detected in one of our survey fields, with a line indicating equal\nflux-density values. The brightest sources have been omitted from the plot.\nSources classified as point-like and extended are represented as filled circles\nand open squares respectively.\n\nThe Gaussian-fitting converged successfully for all sources\nwithin 25 iterations. Fig. 10 shows how S in compares with S pk for\nall sources, 10 of which are classified as extended.\nNo over-narrow sources were detected. However, when using\na primary beam cut-off of 0.3 to map the data several sources were\nfound to have integrated flux-densities significantly smaller than\ntheir peak flux-densities. This is indicative of a spurious source.\nThese detections were found to be separated from other sources\n(spurious or real) by a distance much smaller than a synthesised\nbeam FWHM. This is implausible and resulted from the edge of a\ncomponent map passing through a genuine source \u2013 this resulted in\na sharp discontinuity in pixel values (Fig. 11).\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\f10C Survey \u2013 Data Analysis\n\n9\n\nREFERENCES\n26 21 00\n\n20 30\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n00\n\n19 30\n\n00\n\n18 30\n\n00\n\n03 01 46\n\n44\n\n42\n\n40\n38\n36\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n34\n\n32\n\nFigure 11.

In an accompanying\npaper, AMI Consortium: Davies et al. (2010), we present the first\nresults from the survey, including the deep 15.7-GHz source count.\nHere, we have concentrated on developing techniques for producing and analysing the survey raster maps. In particular, we have:\n(1) developed systematic, automated methods for identifying\nand characterising sources in maps with varying noise levels and\nsythesised beams.\n(2) proposed a straightforward and robust method for distinguishing between point and extended sources over a wide range\nof SNRs. Our method has been tested using maps including simulated sources and noise, and has been shown to be successful in\nidentifying extended emission.\n(3) applied our techniques to real sky maps and demonstrated\nthat our automated techniques are useful for identifying and chracterising complex structure (see, for example, Fig. 4).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the staff of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory for the maintenance and operation of the AMI.
