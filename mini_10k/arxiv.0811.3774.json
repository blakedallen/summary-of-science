In particular, for a fixed prime \u2118 of K, we determine the probability\nthat \u2118 splits into r primes in a random G-extension of K that is unramified at \u2118. We\nfind that these probabilities are nicely behaved and mostly independent. This is in\nanalogy to Chebotarev's density theorem, which gives the probability that in a fixed\nextension a random prime of K splits into r primes in the extension. We also give\nthe asymptotics for the number of G-extensions with bounded conductor. In fact, we\ngive a class of extension invariants, including conductor, for which we obtain the same\ncounting and probabilistic results. In contrast, we prove that that neither the analogy\nwith the Chebotarev probabilities nor the independence of probabilities holds when\nextensions are ordered by discriminant.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGiven a finite Galois extension L/Q with Galois group G, and a rational prime p, what is\nthe probability that p splits completely in L? If we fix L and vary p, the Chebotarev density\ntheorem tells us what proportion of primes have any given splitting behavior. However, we\ncan alternatively fix p (and G), and study the probability that p splits a certain way in a\nrandom L with Gal(L/Q) \u223c\n= G. We ask whether the probabilities of the unramified splitting\ntypes are in the proportions we expect from the Chebotarev density theorem. We also ask\nif the probabilities are independent at different primes p. In fact, we shall ask more refined\nquestions and study the probabilities of various local Qv -algebras Lv := L \u2297Q Qv at a place v\nof Q. These questions have recently been asked by Bhargava [5, Section 8.2] and have come\nup naturally in the work counting extensions of Q with a given Galois group (see [6], [8],\n[23], [28], and Section 1.2). In this paper, we answer these refined questions for abelian G.\nFor the rest of this paper, we fix a finite abelian group G.\nWe define a G-extension of a field K to be a Galois extension L/K with an isomorphism\n\u03c6 : G \u2192 Gal(L/K). An isomorphism of two G-extensions L and L\u2032 is given by an isomorphism L \u2192 L\u2032 of K-algebras that respects the G-action on L and L\u2032 . Let EG (K) be the\n1\n\n\fset of isomorphism classes of G-extensions of K. Given a finite set S of places of Q, and a\nQv -algebra Tv for each v \u2208 S, we use T to denote the collection of all the choices Tv . We\ndefine the probability of T as follows:\n#{ L \u2208 EG (Q) | Lv \u223c\n= Tv for all v \u2208 S and f(L) < X}\n(1)\nPr(T ) = lim\n,\nX\u2192\u221e\n#{L \u2208 EG (Q) | f(L) < X}\nwhere f(L) is the finite conductor of L over Q. We can analogously define the probability of\none local algebra Tv , or of a splitting type of a prime.\nGiven a G-extension L of Q, every Lv is of the form M \u2295r , where M is a field extension\nof Qv with Galois group H, and H is a subgroup of G of index r. The first twist in this\nstory is that some M \u2295r of this form never occur as Lv . For example, when G = Z/8Z,\nit is never the case that L2 /Q2 is unramified of degree 8. This means we cannot expect\nunramified splitting types to occur in the proportions suggested by the Chebotarev density\ntheorem. Wang [25], in a correction to work of Grunwald [16], completely determined which\nlocal algebras occur. The only obstruction is that for even |G|, some Q2 algebras do not\noccur as L2 for any G-extension L. Call these inviable Q2 -algebras (and all other M \u2295r of the\nabove form viable) and note the characterization implicitly depends on G. Once one knows\nwhich local algebras can occur, it is natural to ask how often they occur. We answer that\nquestion in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let v be a place of Q. Let M and M \u2032 be field extensions of Qv with Galois\ngroups H and H \u2032 that are subgroups of G of index r and r \u2032 , respectively. Then, unless v = 2\n\u2032\nand at least one of M \u2295r , M \u2032\u2295r is inviable,\nPr(M \u2295r )\n=\nPr(M \u2032\u2295r\u2032 )\n\n| Hom0 (H,G)|\nf(M )\n,\n| Hom0 (H \u2032 ,G)|\n\u2032\nf(M )\n\nwhere Hom0 (E, G) denotes the set of injective homomorphisms from E to G. The conductor\nf(M) is viewed as an element of Q.\nWe will refer to the density of primes with a given splitting type in a fixed G-extension as\nthe Chebotarev probability of that splitting type. We compare Theorem 1.1 to the Chebotarev\ndensity theorem in the following corollary.\nCorollary 1.2. The probability of a fixed rational prime p (not 2 if |G| is even) splitting into\nr primes in a random L \u2208 EG (Q), given that p is unramified, is the same as the Chebotarev\nprobability of a random rational prime p splitting into r primes in a fixed L \u2208 EG (Q).\nIn fact, it follows from Theorem 1.1 that when |G| is even and p = 2 the probabilities of\nviable splitting types in a random G-extension occur in the same proportions as they occur\nin the Chebotarev density theorem for a fixed extension and random prime. Of course, one\ncontrast to the Chebotarev probabilities is that for a fixed p and a random G-extension L,\nthe prime p will be ramified with positive probability. In this paper, we also determine the\nindependence of the local probabilities computed in Theorem 1.1, leading to the following\nresult.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.3. For any finite set S of places of Q and any choice of local Qv -algebras Tv\nfor v \u2208 S, the events Tv are independent.\nOne may ask whether we obtain the same result if we count the G-extensions in other\nways, for example by replacing the conductor by the discriminant, by an Artin conductor,\nor by the product of the ramified primes. In fact, in Section 2 we prove a stronger version\nof Theorem 1.1 which replaces the conductor with any function satisfying a certain fairness\nhypothesis (defined in Section 2), which is satisfied by the conductor, some Artin conductors,\nand the product of the ramified primes. In Section 5 we give examples of some Artin\nconductors that are fair. The discriminant is fair only when G has prime exponent. Much\nwork has been done to study the asymptotics of the number of extensions with bounded\ndiscriminant and having Galois closure with a specified Galois group (see [6] and [7] for\nsurveys). These asymptotics were determined completely for abelian Galois groups by M\u00e4ki\n[18]. M\u00e4ki [19] also has determined the asymptotics of the number of extensions with fixed\nabelian Galois group and bounded conductor. In Section 3, we give the asymptotics of the\nnumber of G-extensions with bounded conductor (or any fair counting function) for a finite\nabelian group G. Our result is a generalization of M\u00e4ki's work [19], in that we can replace the\nconductor by other fair counting functions and that we give the result over an arbitrary base\nnumber field (see Section 1.1). We also give the constant in the asymptotic more explicitly\nthan it appears in [19].\nFor degree n extensions having Galois closure with Galois group Sn , it is known that\nwhen counting by discriminant for n = 2, 3, 4, and 5, local completions Lv show up with\nprobability proportional to | AutQ1 Lv | | Disc1 Lv | (see [11], [3], and [4] for the computation of the\nv\nprobabilities, and [5] for this interpretation). We will see after Corollary 1.7 how to interpret\nour probabilities in closer analogy to the results in [11], [3], and [4]. However, it turns out that\ncounting abelian extensions by discriminant does not lead to such nice local probabilities.\nThis was observed by Wright [28], in his work on counting abelian extensions asymptotically\nby discriminant. Let the discriminant probability be defined as in Equation (1) but with the\nconductor replaced by the absolute value of the discriminant. We call two events discriminant\nindependent if they are independent with the discriminant probability. Wright showed that\nall viable Qv -algebras occur with positive discriminant probability, and noted that when\nG has prime exponent, the relative probabilities of local extensions are simple expressions.\n(Wright actually works over an arbitrary global field with characteristic not dividing |G|;\nin Section 1.1 of this paper we describe our work over an arbitrary number field.) When\nG = Z/4Z, Wright notes that the ratio of the discriminant probability of Q\u22954\np to the the\ndiscriminant probability of the unramified extension of Qp of degree 4 is an apparently very\ncomplicated expression. In Section 4, we prove the following propositions in order to show\nthat the discriminant probability analogs of Corollary 1.2 or Theorem 1.3 do not hold.\nProposition 1.4. Let p, q1 , and q2 be primes with qi \u2261 1 (mod p2 ) for i = 1, 2. Then q1\nramifying and q2 ramifying in a random Z/p2 Z-extension are not discriminant independent.\nThe Chebotarev probability that a random prime splits completely in a fixed Z/9Zextension is 91 . However, we have the following.\n3\n\n\fProposition 1.5. Let q = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13. Given that q is unramified, the discriminant\nprobability that q splits completely in a random Z/9Z-extension is strictly less than 91 .\nFor comparison, in the above two cases we have that the (conductor) probabilities are\nindependent, and the (conductor) probability is 19 , respectively.\n\n1.1\n\nOther base fields\n\nOf course, we can ask all of the same questions when Q is replaced by an arbitrary number\nfield K, and we now fix a number field K. However, for arbitrary number fields there is\na further twist in this story. Given G, it is possible that the Kv -algebra Tv and the Kv\u2032 algebra Tv\u2032\u2032 both occur from global G-extensions, but never occur simultaneously (see [27]).\nThis suggests that we should not expect Tv and Tv\u2032\u2032 to be independent events. However,\ngiven obstructions of this sort, which were completely determined in [25] (or see [1, Chapter\n10]), we have the best possible behavior of the local probabilities. We shall need more precise\nlanguage to clearly explain this behavior.\nThe local Kv -algebras coming from L have structure that we have so far ignored; namely,\nthey have a G-action coming from the global G-action. Given a field F , a G-structured\nF -algebra is an \u00e9tale F -algebra L of degree |G| with an inclusion G \u0592\u2192 AutF (L) of G into\nthe F -algebra automorphisms of L, such that G acts transitively on the idempotents of\nL. An isomorphism of two G-structured F -algebras L and L\u2032 is an F -algebra isomorphism\nL\u2192L\u2032 such that the induced map AutF (L) \u2192 AutF (L\u2032 ) restricts to the identity on G. If we\nhave a G-extension L of K, for each place v of K, then we have a G-structured Kv -algebra\nLv = L \u2297K Kv , where G acts on the left factor. Given a subgroup H of G, and an Hextension M of Kv , we can form the induced G-structured Kv -algebra IndG\nH M via the usual\nconstruction of an induced representation, which will have a natural structure of an \u00e9tale\nKv -algebra. All G-structured Kv -algebras coming from G-extensions L of K are of the form\nIndG\nH M. So we can ask an even more refined question, at all places, about the probability of\na certain G-structured Kv -algebra. We let f(L) be the norm from K to Q of the conductor\nof L/K (or of the conductor of L/Kv , viewed as an ideal of K). Let S be a finite set of\nplaces of K, and let \u03a3 denote a choice \u03a3v of G-structured Kv -algebra for each v \u2208 S, which\nwe refer to as a (local ) specification. We can then define probabilities as in Equation (1),\nreplacing EG (Q) with EG (K).\nIf there exists a G-extension L/K such that Lv \u223c\n= \u03a3v for all v \u2208 S, then we call \u03a3 viable\nand otherwise we call it inviable. The question of which specifications are viable has been\ncompletely answered (see [1, Chapter 10]). There is a set S0 of places of K (depending on G,\nall dividing 2, and empty if |G| is odd) and a finite list \u03a3(1), . . . , \u03a3(l) of local specifications\non S0 such that a local specification \u03a3 on S is viable if and only if either S0 6\u2282 S or \u03a3\nrestricts to some \u03a3(i) on S0 . (We give S0 explicitly in Section 2.) In other words, whether\na specification on S is viable depends only on its specifications at places in S0 , and if a\nspecification does not include specifications at all places in S0 then it is viable.\nNow\nQ we will build a model for the expected probabilities of local specifications. Let\n\u03a9 = v place of K {isom. classes of G-structured Kv -algebras}. For a local specification \u03a3, let\n4\n\n\fSl\n\u03a3\u0303 = {x \u2208 \u03a9 | xv \u223c\n= \u03a3v for all v \u2208 S}. Let A = i=1 \u03a3\u0303(i), where \u03a3(i) are as in the above\nparagraph in the condition for a local specification to be viable. So for a specification \u03a3 on\nS, we have that \u03a3\u0303 \u2229 A is non-empty if and only if \u03a3 is viable, and in fact\n\u03a3\u0303 \u2229 A = {\u03a3\u0303\u2032 local specification on S \u222a S0 | \u03a3\u2032 viable and restricts to \u03a3 on S}.\nThe \u03a3\u0303v generate an algebra of subsets of \u03a9. We can define a finitely additive probability\nmeasure P on this algebra by specifying that\nP (\u03a3\u0303v )\n1.\n=\nP (\u03a3\u0303\u2032 v )\n\n1\nf(\u03a3v )\n1\nf(\u03a3\u2032v )\n\nfor all G-structured Kv -algebras \u03a3v and \u03a3\u2032v\n\n2. \u03a3\u0303v1 , . . . , \u03a3\u0303vs at pairwise distinct places v1 , . . . , vs , respectively, are independent.\nWe might at first hope that P is a model for the probabilities of local specifications in\nthe space of G-extensions. However, once we know that some specifications never occur,\nincluding combinations of occurring specifications, the best we can hope for is the following,\nwhich we prove in Section 2.\nTheorem 1.6. For a local specification \u03a3 on a finite set of places S,\nPr(\u03a3) = P (\u03a3\u0303|A).\nCorollary 1.7. If S is a finite set of places of K either containing S0 or disjoint from S0 ,\nand \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 are viable local specifications on S then\nQ\n1\nPr(\u03a3)\nv\u2208S f(\u03a3v )\n=Q\n1 .\nPr(\u03a3\u2032 )\nv\u2208S f(\u03a3\u2032 )\nv\n\nAll G-structured algebras have |G| automorphisms (Proposition 2.6), and so for v not in\nS0 , we can also say that the probability of \u03a3v is proportional to | Aut(\u03a31v )|f(\u03a3v ) .\nCorollary 1.8. The probability of a fixed prime \u2118 of K (not in S0 ) splitting into r primes in\na random L \u2208 EG (K), given that \u2118 is unramified, is the same as the Chebotarev probability\nof a random prime \u2118 of K splitting into r primes in a fixed L \u2208 EG (K).\nCorollary 1.9. If S1 , . . . , St are pairwise disjoint finite sets of places of K, and each Si\neither contains S0 or is disjoint from S0 , then local specifications \u03a3(i) on Si are independent.\nTheorem 1.6 says that the probabilities of local specifications of random G-extensions\nare exactly as in a model with simple and independent local probabilities, but restricted to\na subspace corresponding to the viable specifications on S0 . As when K = Q, we prove\nTheorem 1.6 and its corollaries as a special case of analogous results (see Theorem 2.1) for\nmore general ways of counting extensions than by conductor.\n\n5\n\n\f1.2\n\nHistory of the problem and previous work\n\nThe results mentioned above of Davenport and Heilbronn ([11]) and Bhargava ([3] and [4])\nare a major motivation of this work. These results show that the local behaviors of random\ndegree n extensions of Q whose Galois closure has Galois group Sn have nice discriminant\nprobabilities and are discriminant independent, when n = 3, 4, or 5. The work of Datskovsky\nand Wright [10] generalizes that of Davenport and Heilbronn (the case n = 3) to an arbitrary\nbase field.\nTaylor [23] proves the result of our Corollary 1.8 in the special case that G = Z/nZ, and\nassuming that if 2g | n then K contains the 2g th roots of unity (in which case S0 is empty).\nTaylor attributes the question of the distribution of splitting types of a given prime in random\nG-extensions to Fr\u00f6hlich, who was motivated by the work of Davenport and Heilbronn [11].\nWright [28] proves an analog of Corollary 1.7 for discriminant probability in the case that\nG = (Z/pZ)b for p prime and |S| = 1, and for these G the discriminant is a fixed power\nof the conductor, and thus discriminant probability is the same as conductor probability.\nWright [28] suggests that his methods for counting abelian extensions by discriminant could\nbe combined with the methods of Taylor to count abelian extensions by conductor. In this\npaper, we follow this suggestion and incorporate methods of both Wright and Taylor along\nwith some new ideas. We implicitly count abelian extensions by conductor (and give this\nresult in Section 3), but are focused on the probabilities of local behaviors.\nIn the work of counting extensions whose Galois closure has some fixed Galois group,\nit has been often suggested that it is natural to also count such extensions with fixed local\nbehavior (for example, in the work of Cohen, Diaz y Diaz, and Olivier [7] for the group D4 ,\nthe heuristics of Malle [17, Remark 1.2] for general groups, and in the general surveys [6] and\n[8]). Some authors have also considered these questions when one replaces field extensions\nwith polynomials, and counts with a natural density on the polynomials (see [12], [13], [14],\nand [24]).\nTheorems 1.1, 1.3, and 1.6 and their corollaries are all new (except in the special cases\nmentioned above), but the proofs use many techniques that come from the work of Taylor\nand Wright. Some new techniques are required to compute the probabilities exactly in the\ncase of non-cyclic G and for more general ways of counting extensions. An important new\ningredient is the consideration of the probabilities of G-structured Kv -algebras (and not\njust Kv -algebras), which not only allows us to give more refined probabilities but allows\nus to state Theorem 1.6. One of the central contributions of this paper is the formulation\nof Theorem 1.6, which makes precise the idea that the probabilities are as well-behaved as\npossible in light of the non-occurrence of certain local extensions (see [25] and [1]). For\nabelian groups G, we study for the first time the probabilities when more than one local\nbehavior is specified and the independence of these local probabilities. Our results are for all\nbase number fields K, all finite abelian groups G, and for many ways of counting extensions\n(see the definition of fair in Section 2) including by conductor.\n\n6\n\n\f1.3\n\nOutline of the paper\n\nIn Section 2, we define counting functions and fairness, and prove our main theorems. The\nproof of our main theorems involves making a Dirichlet series generating function for the\nextensions we are counting, relating it to L-functions whose analytic behavior is known, using\nstandard Tauberian theorems to deduce asymptotic counting results, and using fairness to\nexpress the desired probabilities in a simple form. In Section 3, we give the asymptotic\nnumber of G-extensions with a given invariant (such as conductor) bounded. We give an\nexplicit Euler product for the constant in this asymptotic result. In Section 4, we prove that\nwhen counting by discriminant, the local probabilities do not have the same nice behavior\nas in the conductor case. In Section 5, we give some examples of fair Artin conductors. In\nSection 6, we discuss the further questions that this work motivates.\n\n2\n\nStatement and proof of the main theorem\n\nIn this section, we prove a generalization of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.6 for more general\nways of counting G-extensions than by conductor. First, in Subsection 2.1, we will define the\nacceptable ways of counting G-extensions. Then, in Subsection 2.2, we state Theorem 2.1\n(our generalization of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.6) and deduce several corollaries. In\nSubsection 2.3, we relate G-structured algebras to Galois representations. In Subsection 2.4,\nwe define a generating function counting G-extensions satisfying a local specification \u03a3 and\nexpress this generating function as a sum of Euler products. In Subsection 2.5, we state\nthree lemmas about the analytic behavior of these Euler products, and then use the standard Tauberian analysis to determine the asymptotic behavior of the coefficient sums of the\ngenerating function from the rightmost poles. From this asymptotic behavior we deduce\nTheorem 2.1. In Subsection 2.6, we prove the three lemmas stated in Subsection 2.5. The\nmethod in Subsection 2.4 is very similar to that of Wright [28] and some of the methods in\nSubsection 2.6 are motivated by those of Taylor [23].\n\n2.1\n\nCounting functions and fairness\n\nWe fix a finite abelian group G and a number field K. Let n = |G|. Let cG : G \u2192 Z\u22650\nbe a function such that 1) cG (g) = 0 if and only if g = 1 and 2) if e is relatively prime\nto the order of g \u2208 G, then cG (g e ) = cG (g). For all places v dividing n or infinite, let cv :\n{isom. classes of G-structured Kv -algebras} \u2192 Z\u22650 be an arbitrary function. From these\nfunctions cG and the cv , we define c : {isom. classes of G-structured Kv -algebras} \u2192 Z\u22650 by\n\uf8f1\nG\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2cG (yv ) if v \u2224 n\u221e, where \u03a3v = IndH M, and M/Kv a field extension,\nc(\u03a3v ) =\nand yv is any generator of tame inertia in Gal(M/Kv ) \u2282 G;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ncv (\u03a3v ) if v | n\u221e.\nQ\nWe then define an invariant C of G-extensions by the product C(L) = v Nv c(Lv ) over places\nof K, where Nv is NK/Q v at finite places and by convention 1 at infinite places. We call such a\n7\n\n\fC, determined by components cG and the cv , a counting function. Let m = ming\u2208G\\{1} cG (g)\nr\nand let M = c\u22121\nG (m). Let Gr = {x \u2208 G | x = 1}.\nA counting function is fair if for all r, we have that M\u2229Gr generates Gr . The norms to Q\nof the conductor and of the product of ramified primes of an extension are both fair counting\nfunctions with m = 1 and M = G \\ {1}. The discriminant is a counting function, but it is\nnot fair unless G has prime exponent. For example, when G = Z/p2 Z, for the discriminant\nwe have M = pZ/p2 Z. In Section 5, we give some examples of fair Artin conductors.\n\n2.2\n\nStatement of the main theorem and corollaries\n\nWe define the C-probability, PrC , by replacing f with C in Equation (1). (Note that C(L) <\nX implies that L is unramified at all primes larger than nX, and so there are only finitely\nmany such extensions.) As\nQ in the definition of P in the introduction, we define PC on the\nalgebra of subsets of \u03a9 = v place of K {isom. classes of G-structured Kv -algebras} generated\nby the \u03a3\u0303v by specifying\nPC (\u03a3\u0303v )\nNv \u2212c(\u03a3v )/m\n\u2032\n1.\n=\n\u2032 )/m for all G-structured algebras \u03a3v and \u03a3v and\n\u2212c(\u03a3\n\u2032\nv\nNv\nPC (\u03a3\u0303 v )\n2. \u03a3\u0303v1 , . . . , \u03a3\u0303vs at pairwise distinct places v1 , . . . , vs are C-independent.\ni\nLet \u03b7i = \u03b62i + \u03b62\u22121\ni , where \u03b62i is a primitive 2 th root of unity. Let s be maximal such\nthat \u03b7s \u2208 K. If 2s+1 does not divide the exponent of G, then let S0 = \u2205. Otherwise, let S0\nbe the set of primes \u2118 of K dividing 2 such that none of \u22121, 2 + \u03b7s and \u22122 \u2212 \u03b7s are squares\nin K\u2118 . Recall that there is a list \u03a3(1), . . . , \u03a3(l) of local specifications on S0 such that a\nlocal specification \u03a3 on S is viable if and only if either\nS S0 6\u2282 S or \u03a3 restricts to some \u03a3(i)\non S0 (see [1, Chapter 10]). We have defined A = li=1 \u03a3\u0303(i). If S0 is empty, then all local\nspecifications are viable and A is the total space \u03a9. In this section, we prove the following\ntheorem, of which Theorems 1.1 and 1.6 are special cases.\n\nTheorem 2.1. For a local specification \u03a3 on a finite set of places S and a fair counting\nfunction C,\nPrC (\u03a3) = PC (\u03a3\u0303|A).\nNow, we will prove several corollaries of Theorem 2.1. Corollaries 1.2, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9\nfrom the introduction are just the following corollaries when C is the norm to Q of the\nconductor. Theorem 1.3 follows from Corollary 1.9.\nCorollary 2.2. If S is a finite set of places of K either containing S0 or disjoint from S0 ,\nand \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 are viable local specifications on S then\nY Nv \u2212c(\u03a3v )/m\nPrC (\u03a3)\n=\n.\nPrC (\u03a3\u2032 ) v\u2208S Nv \u2212c(\u03a3\u2032v )/m\n8\n\n\fProof. If S is disjoint from S0 , then since A only includes specifications on S0 , we have that\n\u03a3\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303\u2032 are each PC -independent from A in \u03a9. Thus PrC (\u03a3) = PC (\u03a3\u0303|A) = PC (\u03a3\u0303), and\nsimilarly for \u03a3\u2032 . If S \u2283 S0 , then since \u03a3 is viable, \u03a3\u0303 \u2282 A. Thus, PrC (\u03a3) = PC (\u03a3\u0303|A) =\nPC (\u03a3\u0303)/PC (A), and similarly for \u03a3\u2032 .\nCorollary 2.3. The C-probability of a fixed prime \u2118 of K (not in S0 ) splitting into r primes\nin a random L \u2208 EG (K), given that \u2118 is unramified, is the same as the Chebotarev probability\nof a random prime \u2118 of K splitting into r primes in a fixed L \u2208 EG (K).\nProof. The number of \u03a3\u2118 that give \u2118 unramified and splitting into r primes is the number\nof order |G|/r elements of |G|. (This can be seen, for example, from Lemma 2.5.) Thus\nPrC (\u2118 splits unramified into r primes)\nnumber of order |G|/r elements of |G|\n=\n,\n\u2032\nPrC (\u2118 splits unramified into r primes)\nnumber of order |G|/r \u2032 elements of |G|\nwhich agrees with the Chebotarev probabilities.\nCorollary 2.4. Let S1 , . . . , St be pairwise disjoint finite sets of places of K, and suppose\neach Si either contains S0 or is disjoint from S0 . (For example, if |S0 | is 0 or 1, then this is\nalways the case.) Then local specifications \u03a3(i) on Si are C-independent.\nProof. If S0 is empty, then A = \u03a9, and this corollary is clear. Otherwise, first suppose\nsome Si , say S1 , contains S0 . If \u03a3(1) is inviable, then PrC (\u03a3(1) ) = 0 and otherwise we have\nPrC (\u03a3(1) ) = PC (\u03a3\u0303(1) )/PC (A). For i 6= 1 we have PrC (\u03a3(i) ) = PC (\u03a3\u0303(i) ), as in the proof of\nCorollary 2.2. Let \u03a3 be the local specification that is unionQof the \u03a3(i) . If \u03a3(1) is inviable\nQ\nP (\u03a3\u0303(i) )\nthen PrC (\u03a3) = 0, and otherwise PrC (\u03a3) = PC (\u03a3\u0303)/PC (A) = iPCC(A) = i PrC (\u03a3(i) ).\n\n(i)\nIf, on the other hand, no Si contains S0 , then we have\nPC (\u03a3\u0303(i) ) for all i and\nQ PrC (\u03a3(i) ) = Q\n\u03a3\u0303 is C-independent from A. Thus PrC (\u03a3) = PC (\u03a3\u0303) = i PrC (\u03a3\u0303 ) = i PrC (\u03a3(i) ).\n\nNotation. We let n = |G| and write G \u223c\n= Z/n1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Z/nk . For the rest of Section 2\nwe use additive notation for G. For all positive integers m, we choose compatible primitive\nm/m\u2032\nmth roots of unity \u03b6m such that if m\u2032 |m, then \u03b6m\u2032 = \u03b6m . Let J be the group of id\u00e8les of\nK. For a map \u03c7 from J, we denote by \u03c7v the restriction of \u03c7 to Kv\u00d7 . Let ov be the ring\nof integers of Kv . Let JS be the group of id\u00e8les which have components in o\u00d7\nv for all places\nv 6\u2208 S. In this paper, when we write a map from the id\u00e8les, id\u00e8le class group, or Kv\u00d7 to\na finite group (e.g. \u03c7 : J \u2192 G), it will always mean a continuous homomorphism (for the\ndiscrete topology on the range).\n\n2.3\n\nG-structured algebras and Galois representations\n\nRecall that G is a finite abelian group. The following two results are fairly standard, but we\ninclude them here for completeness.\n\n9\n\n\fLemma 2.5. For a field F , there is a one to one-correspondence\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\nisomorphism classes of Gcontinuous homomorphisms\n,\n\u2190\u2192\nstructured F-algebras\nGF \u2192 G\nwhere GF is the Galois group of a separable closure of F over F . In this correspondence,\nG-extensions correspond to surjective homomorphisms.\nProof. Given a G-structured K-algebra L with G \u2282 AutK (L), we consider the stabilizer\nStab \u2282 G of one of the fields L0 that is a direct summand of L. We have a morphism\nStab \u2192 Gal(L0 /K). Since G is transitive on the idempotents of L and abelian, this is\nan injection. Since G is transitive on the idempotents, we see that all the fields that are\ndirect summands of L are isomorphic, and thus | Stab | = [L0 : K]. Thus we have Stab \u2192\nGal(L0 /K) is an isomorphism. Its inverse gives GK \u2192 Gal(L0 /K) \u2192 Stab \u2282 G.\nGiven a continuous homomorphism \u03c7 : GK \u2192 G, we have an im(\u03c7)-extension L0 of K\ncorresponding to the kernel of \u03c7 via Galois theory. We let L = IndG\nim(\u03c7) L0 . It is straightforward to check that these two constructions are inverse to each other.\nProposition 2.6. A G-structured algebra has exactly |G|-automorphisms.\nProof. Consider a G-structured F -algebra L. Let F\u0304 be the separable closure of F . There\nare |G| non-zero morphisms \u03c6i : L \u2192 F\u0304 . Let S|G| be the permutations of these \u03c6i . We have\nG \u2282 AutF (L) \u2282 S|G| . An automorphism of L as a G-structured F -algebra is an element\n\u03c3 \u2208 AutF (L) such that \u03c3 centralizes G. Clearly all elements of G will satisfy this condition\nsince G is abelian. Since G acts transitively on the idempotents of L, G acts transitively in\nS|G| . Thus we can relabel the \u03c6i by elements of G, and G will act by multiplication on the\nlabels. So if \u03c3 \u2208 S|G| centralizes G, then \u03c3 is translation by an element of G, and these are\njust the automorphisms that come from G.\nBy class field theory, maps \u03c7 : GK \u2192 G are in one-to-one correspondence with maps\n\u03c7 : J/K \u00d7 \u2192 G. Given the correspondence of Lemma 2.5, we can also apply C to characters\n\u03c7 : J/K \u00d7 \u2192 G. We now view a generator of tame inertia yv as an element of Kv\u00d7 , and define\nc(\u03c7v ) to be cG (\u03c7v (yv )) for v finite and not dividing n. For v infinite or dividing n, let Lv be\nthe G-structured \u00e9tale Kv -algebra corresponding to the character \u03c7v , and define c(\u03c7v ) to be\ncv (Lv ). We say that\nY\nC(\u03c7) =\nNv c(\u03c7v )\nv place of K\n\nJust as \u03a3 denotes local specifications of G-structured Kv -algebras at the places v \u2208 S, we\nlet \u03c6 denote a collection of choices \u03c6v : Kv\u00d7 \u2192 G for all v \u2208 S. We say that \u03c6 corresponds to\n\u03a3 if each \u03c6v corresponds to \u03a3v via Lemma 2.5.\n\n2.4\n\nGenerating functions and Euler products\n\nFor now, we will assume C is an arbitrary counting function, and in Lemma 2.15, we will\nfirst see how fairness plays a role in our analysis. Also, for now we will consider one local\n10\n\n\fspecification \u03a3 (not necessarily viable) on a finite set S of places of K such that S contains\nall infinite places, places dividing n, and so that the finite places of S generate the class group\nof K. In particular, if oS is the ring of S-integers of K (elements of K with non-negative\nvaluation at all places not in S), then oS has class number 1.\nWe define the generating functions\nNC,G (s, \u03a3) =\n\nX\n\nG-extensions L/K\n\u2200v\u2208S Lv \u223c\n=\u03a3v\n\n1\nC(L)s\n\nand\n\nNC,G (s, \u03c6) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7:J/K \u00d7 \u2192G\n\u2200v\u2208S \u03c7v =\u03c6v\n\u03c7 surjective\n\n1\n.\nC(\u03c7)s\n\nBy Lemma 2.5, for \u03c6 corresponding to \u03a3 we have NC,G (s, \u03a3) = NC,G (s, \u03c6). It will be easier\nto work without the restriction that our characters are surjective, so we define the following\ngenerating function:\nX\n1\nFC,G (s, \u03c6) =\n.\nC(\u03c7)s\n\u00d7\n\u03c7:J/K \u2192G\n\u2200v\u2208S \u03c7v =\u03c6v\n\nFor a subgroup H of G, we define C|H , a counting function for H. For \u03c7v : J/K \u00d7 \u2192H,\n\u03c7v\nwe let c|H (\u03c7v ) = c(J/K \u00d7 \u2192 H \u2282 G). We have that\nX\nFC,G (s, \u03c6) =\nNC|H ,H (s, \u03c6).\nH subgroup of G\n\nWe can use M\u00f6bius inversion (as in Wright's work [28, Section 2]) to write\nX\n\u03bc(H, G)FC|H ,H (s, \u03c6),\nNC,G (s, \u03c6) =\nH subgroup of G\n\nwhere \u03bc(H, G) is a constant and \u03bc(G, G) = 1. (This is just solving an upper triangular\nsystem of linear equations.) Thus, by studying the FC,G we can recover information about\nthe NC,G .\nA character \u03c7 : J \u2192 G is determined by a collection of \u03c7v : Kv\u00d7 \u2192 G for all places v of\nK, but not all \u03c7 factor through J/K \u00d7 . However, we can use the following.\n\u00d7\nLemma 2.7. If oS has class number 1, then the natural map JS /o\u00d7\nS \u2192 J/K is an isomorphism.\n\nProof. Since JS \u2229K \u00d7 = o\u00d7\nS , the map is injective. Let x \u2208 J. Then, since oS has class number\n1, we can find an element of K with specified valuation at all places outside S. In particular,\nwe can find a y \u2208 K \u00d7 such that yx \u2208 JS .\nWe can then rewrite\nFC,G (s, \u03c6) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7:JS /o\u00d7\nS \u2192G\n\u2200v\u2208S \u03c7v =\u03c6v\n\n11\n\n1\n.\nC(\u03c7)s\n\n\fWe shall study characters on JS , and then check their Q\nbehavior on the finitely generated\nk\nni\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\ngroup o\u00d7\nto\nsee\nif\nthey\nfactor\nthrough\nJ\n/o\n.\nLet\nA\n=\nS\nS\nS\ni=1 oS /oS .

Recall that m = ming\u2208G\\{1} cG (g) and M = c\u22121\nG (m). We will prove the\nfollowing lemma by relating FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) to L-functions whose analytic behavior we already\nknow.\nLemma 2.9. For any counting function C, the product FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) absolutely converges in\nRe(s) > m1 and has a meromorphic continuation to Re(s) \u2265 m1 , analytic away from s = m1 .\nThe pole of FC,G (s, 1, \u03c6) at s = m1 is of order\n1\n,\n[K(\u03b6\nrg ) : K]\ng\u2208M\nX\n\nwhere rg is the order of g in G.\n12\n\n\fThus we also obtain a meromorphic continuation to Re(s) \u2265 m1 for FC,G (s, \u03c6) and\nNC,G (s, \u03c6). Lemma 2.9 will allow us to use a Tauberian theorem (see [20, Corollary, p. 121])\nto find the probabilities PrC . In the application of the Tauberian theorem, we will need to\nknow which terms of FC,G (s, \u03c6) contribute to the main pole, and the following lemma will\ntell us just that.\nLemma 2.10. For a counting function C, there is a subgroup E(C) of A such that if \u01eb \u2208 E(C)\nthen FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) has a pole of the same order at s = m1 as FC,G (s, 1, \u03c6), and if \u01eb 6\u2208 E(C) then\nFC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) has a pole of smaller order (possibly equal to zero) than that of FC,G (s, 1, \u03c6).\nThe following lemma will allow us to simplify the probabilities we obtain into a reasonable\nform for fair counting functions.\nLemma 2.11. If C is fair, v 6\u2208 S, and \u03c7v : o\u00d7\nv \u2192 G, then for all e \u2208 E(C), we have\n\u03c7v (e) = 0.\nUsing these lemmas, we can prove Theorem 2.1.\nProof of Theorem 2.1 Assume C is fair.

So, we will investigate the behavior at\n1\nby manipulating the Euler product for FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) until it resembles a product of Lm\nfunctions.

A division of G is a set of all the invertible multiples of some element x \u2208 G,\nin other words {y | y = ex and x = f y for some e, f \u2208 Z}. Let Div(G) be the set of nonidentity divisions of G. For an element g \u2208 G, let rg be its order and for d \u2208 Div(G), let\nrd be the order of any element of d. Recall that any map from o\u00d7\nv to a finite group of order\nrelatively prime to v factors through (ov /v)\u00d7 .\nWe now make a specific choice, for all places v \u2224 |G|, of a generator yv of the tame inertia\ngroup of Kv (which is isomorphic to (ov /v)\u00d7 ). Our choice is that yv \u2261 \u03b6N v\u22121 (mod v), where\n\u03b6N v\u22121 is the in the primitive (Nv \u2212 1)th root of unity we fixed just before Section 2.3.\nSince c(\u03c7v ) only depends on the division of \u03c7v (yv ), for a division d we can write c(d) to\ndenote c(\u03c7v ) for any \u03c7v that sends yv to an element of d.\nWe now rearrange FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) as follows\n\uf8eb\nX\nY\n\uf8ed\nFG (s, \u01eb, \u03a3) \u2248m\nv6\u2208S\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c7v :o\u00d7\nv \u2192G\n\nY\uf8ec\n\uf8ec1 +\n\uf8ed\n\nv6\u2208S\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03c7 \u0307v (\u01eb) \uf8f8\nNv c(\u03c7v )s\n\nX X\n\nX\n\nd\u2208Div(G) g\u2208d \u03c7v :o\u00d7\nv \u2192G\n\u03c7v (yv )=g\n\n16\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03c7 \u0307v (\u01eb) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\nNv c(d)s \uf8f8\n\n\fThe sum over \u03c7v : o\u00d7\nv \u2192 G such that \u03c7v (yv ) = g has at most one term, but we keep the\nsummation sign for notational convenience.

Clearly the maximal order pole among terms FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) is in FC,G (s, 1, \u03c6), and\nany other FC,G (s, \u01eb, \u03c6) has that same order pole if and only if M \u2282 G(\u01eb). Let E(C) be the\nelements \u01eb \u2208 A such that M \u2282 G(\u01eb). It is easy to see E(C) is a subgroup, and this proves\nLemma 2.10. Lemma 2.11 will follow from the next result.\nLemma 2.15. For a fair counting function C, and \u01eb \u2208 E(C), we have \u01ebj 1/r \u2208 K(\u03b6r ) for all\nr | nj .\nProof. Fix a j with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k and an r dividing nj . Let g be the element of G with\nn\njth projection rj and all other projections 0. Since g is of order r and C is fair, we can\nP\nwrite ls=1 gs = g, where gs are elements of M and all gs have order dividing r. Write\nnh\ngs = (gs,1, . . . , gs,k ) according to our chosen factorization of G. We can write gs,i = li s,is,i\nwith (hs,i , ls,i ) = 1. Since gs is of order dividing r, we must have ls,i |r. Thus by definition of\nE(C) we have\nk\nY\nh /l\ngs\n\u01eb =\n\u01ebi s,i s,i \u2208 K(\u03b6r ).\ni=1\n\nWe then see that\n\nl Y\nk\nY\n\nh\n\n\u01ebi s,i\n\n/ls,i\n\n\u2208 K(\u03b6r ).\n\ns=1 i=1\n\nP\nn\nnh\nBy the choice of the gs , we have that ls=1 li s,is,i (as a sum in Z/ni ) is rj if i = j and 0\nP\nhs,i\n(as a sum in Q/Z) is 1r if i = j and 0 otherwise. Thus, we\notherwise. Equivalently, ls=1 ls,i\nQ Q\nh /d\nconclude that ls=1 ki=1 \u01ebi s,i s,i is \u01ebj 1/r times an element of K \u00d7 , and thus \u01ebj 1/r \u2208 K(\u03b6r ).\n20\n\n\fSuppose C is fair, v 6\u2208 S, and we have a \u03c7 : o\u00d7\nv \u2192 G of order r, with projection to Z/ni Z\nof order li . Then Nv \u2261 1 (mod r), and thus for all i we have Kv = Kv (\u03b6li ). So, for all\n\u01eb \u2208 E(C), we have \u01ebj 1/lj \u2208 K(\u03b6lj ), which implies that \u01ebj 1/lj \u2208 Kv (\u03b6lj ) = Kv , and thus \u01ebj is a\nlj th power in o\u00d7\nv for all j. We conclude \u03c7 \u0307v (\u01eb) = 0, which proves Lemma 2.11.\nRemark 2.16. By definition, E(C) depends on our choice of C. However, given that C is\nfair, by Lemma 2.15, we see that for \u01eb \u2208 E(C) we have \u01ebg \u2208 K(\u03b6rg ) for all g \u2208 G. If \u01eb \u2208 A\nis such that \u01ebg \u2208 K(\u03b6rg ) for all g \u2208 G, then \u01eb \u2208 E(C). Thus if C is fair, we see that E(C) is\nthe subgroup of \u01eb such that \u01ebg \u2208 K(\u03b6rg ) for all g \u2208 G, and thus does not depend on C.\n\n3\n\nCounting by conductor\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 2.1 in Section 2.5, we have implicitly found the asymptotics of\nNC,G (X) := #{L \u2208 EG (K)|C(L) < X},\nfor any fair counting function C. We collect that result here. Recall the definition of S0\ni\nfrom Section 2 as follows. Let \u03b7i = \u03b62i + \u03b62\u22121\ni , where \u03b62i is a primitive 2 th root of unity. Let\nsK be maximal such that \u03b7sK \u2208 K. If 2sK +1 does not divide the exponent of G, then let\nS0 (K) = \u2205. Otherwise, let S0 (K) be the set of primes \u2118 of K dividing 2 such that none of\n\u22121, 2 + \u03b7sK and \u22122 \u2212 \u03b7sK are squares in K\u2118 .\nTheorem 3.1.

For fair C, we have |E(C)| = Sp(K, G).\n1\nl\n\nProof. We know from Lemma 2.15 that \u01eb \u2208 E(C) implies that for all li | ni we have \u01ebi i \u2208\nK(\u03b6li ). If v 6\u2208 S, and (Nv \u2212 1, ni ) = li , then \u01ebi is an ni th power in Kv if and only if it is\n1\nni\n\nan li th power in Kv . Since li | Nv \u2212 1, we have Kv (\u03b6li ) = Kv , and thus \u01ebi \u2208 Kv . By [1,\nn /2\nChapter 10, Theorem 1], it follows that either 1) \u01ebi is an ni th power in K or 2) \u01ebi \u2208 b0 i K ni ,\nwhere b0 = 2 + \u03b7sK = (1 + \u03b62sK )2 . Also, the second case only occurs when none of \u22121, 2 + \u03b7sK\nand \u22122 \u2212 \u03b7sK are squares in K and when 2sK +1 | ni .\nn /2\nNext, we will see that any \u01eb such that \u01ebi = b0 i and 2sK +1 | ni for some i \u2208 I and \u01ebj = 1\nfor all j 6\u2208 I is in E(C). First note that b0 is a unit at all places not dividing 2, and so it will\nbe in o\u00d7\nS as long as S contains 2 (which we have required when |G| is even). We can reduce\n22\n\n\fn /2\n\nto the case that I = {i}. Then we need to conclude that b0 i \u2208 K(\u03b6li )li for all li | ni . We\ncan easily reduce to the case that ni is a power of 2 (for example by choosing the ni to be\nn /2\nprime powers originally). We know that b0 i \u2208 K ni /2 . If li = ni , then K(\u03b6li ) contains \u03b62sK\nn /2\n(because 2sK | ni ) and thus b0 i is a li th power in K(\u03b6li ).\nWe see that E(C) is trivial when any of \u22121, 2 + \u03b7sK and \u22122 \u2212 \u03b7sK are squares in K.\nOtherwise, E(C) contains exactly the \u01eb that have \u01ebi = 1 where 2sK +1 \u2224 ni and that have\nn /2\nn /2\n\u01ebi = 1 or b0 i at all other i. From [1, Chapter 10, Theorem 1] we know that b0 i is not an\nni th power in K when none of \u22121, 2 + \u03b7sK and \u22122 \u2212 \u03b7sK are squares in K and 2sK +1 | ni .\nThis proves the lemma.\nThe next lemma follows from the fact that a local specification of G-structured algebras\non S containing S0 (K) is viable if and only if its restriction to S0 is viable (see [1, Chapter 10,\nTheorem 5]). Also recall Lemma 2.5, which gives the correspondence between G-structured\nalgebras and Galois representations.\nLemma 3.3.

We show that when one replaces the\nconductor by the discriminant when defining probabilities in Equation (1) (to define what\nwe call discriminant probabilities), we do not in general have analogs of the nice behavior\nof Corollary 1.2 and Theorem 1.3. When G has prime exponent, the discriminant is a\nfixed power of the conductor, and so we do have analogs of Corollary 1.2 and Theorem 1.3.\nHowever, in the simplest case when G does not have prime exponent, that is G = Z/p2 Z for\np prime, we find examples of dependence of behaviors at different places (Proposition 4.1),\nand examples where we do not have the Chebotarev probabilities for unramified splitting\nbehavior (Proposition 4.4). As discussed in the introduction, Wright [28] observed that for\nG = Z/4Z the ratios of probabilities of local behaviors are apparently very complicated.\nOur propositions give concrete evidence for the suggestion of Wright that the discriminant\nprobabilities are not well-behaved. We compute the probabilities for the propositions below\nin a similar fashion to our work in Section 2.\n\n23\n\n\fProposition 4.1. Let p, q1 , and q2 be primes with qi \u2261 1 (mod p2 ) for i = 1, 2. If G =\nZ/p2 Z, then q1 ramifying and q2 ramifying in a random G-extension are not discriminant\nindependent.\nQ\nProof. From Lemma 2.7 with S empty, we have J/Q\u00d7 \u223c\n= p Z\u00d7\np \u00d7R/{\u00b11}, where the product\nis over finite places of Q. We also have the following.\n\nLemma 4.2. The natural map\nY\nY\nHom( Z\u00d7\n\u00d7\nR/{\u00b11},\nG)\n\u2192\nHom(\nZ\u00d7\np\np , G),\np\n\np\n\nsending \u03c7 7\u2192 \u03c7(\u2212, 1), is an isomorphism.\nWe work as in Section 2, but now we let \u03a6 be a set of isomorphism classes of G-structured\nalgebras at each place of S instead of just considering a single G-structured algebra. For\nthe following computations, we let G be either Z/p2 Z or pZ/p2 Z, and let D on Z/p2 Z be\ngiven by D(L) = | DiscQ L|, and D on pZ/p2 Z be given by D|pZ/p2Z (L) = | DiscQ L|p . In both\ncases, m = p(p \u2212 1). Let S be a finite set of finite places and let \u03a6 specify that a character\nis unramified at all places in S. We consider\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nY\nX\n1 \uf8f8\n1\n\uf8ed\n=\nFD,G (s, \u03a6) :=\n,\ns\nD(\u03c7)\nD(\u03c7l )s\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nl6\u2208S\n\u03c7:J/Q \u2192G\n\u2200v\u2208S \u03c7v \u2208\u03a6v\n\n\u03c7l :Zl \u2192G\n\nwhere the product is over finite rational primes l. We can express FD,G (s, \u03a6) as this Euler\n\u00d7\nproduct by Lemma\nQ \u00d7 4.2, which allows us to count characters from J/Q by counting characters from l Zl . We know that D only depends on the restriction of local characters to\nZ\u00d7\nl . We see that FD,G (s, \u03a6) only differs by finitely many factors from the FD,G (s, 1, \u03c6) of\nSection 2 (for any choice of \u03c6), and that FD,G (s, \u03a6)/FD,G (s, 1, \u03c6) is entire.

Then the above tells us that q1 ramifying and q2 ramifying\nare D-independent events for random characters to Z/p2 Z. We see that q1 ramifying and q2\nramifying are D-independent events for random characters with image in pZ/p2 Z. Also, the\nprobability that a random character to Z/p2 Z has image in pZ/p2 Z is not 0 or 1. Since we\n2\n2\nhave qi \u2261 1 (mod p2 ), there are more maps from Z\u00d7\nqi to Z/p Z than to pZ/p Z. Thus the\nprobabilities of qi ramifying in a random character to Z/p2 Z and a in random character with\nimage in pZ/p2 Z are different. We have the following simple fact from probability theory.\nLemma 4.3. Let A be an event with positive probability not equal to 1. If E1 and E2 are\nindependent, independent given A, and for i = 1, 2 we have that the Pr(Ei |A) 6= Pr(Ei ), then\nE1 and E2 are not independent given not-A.\nSo we can conclude that the probabilities of q1 and q2 ramifying in a random surjective\ncharacter to Z/p2 Z, or equivalently in a Z/p2 Z-extension of Q, are not independent.\nProposition 4.4. Let q = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13. Given that q is unramified, the discriminant\nprobability that q splits completely in a Z/9Z-extension is less than 19 .\nProof. From Wright [28, Theorem I.4], we know that q is unramified with non-zero discriminant probability in a random Z/9Z-extension, and thus is makes sense to formulate the\nproposition. First, we let G = Z/p2 Z for an arbitrary odd prime p. We let S = {q} for\nsome prime q, and define \u03c6 on S with \u03c6q the\u0010\u0010\ntrivial character.\u0011We will\u0011use the isomorphisms\nQ\nQ\n\u00d7\nHom(J/Q\u00d7 , G) \u223c\nZ\u00d7 \u00d7 Q\u00d7 /hqi, G .

By the method in the proof of Proposition 4.1, we\ncan compute that the discriminant probability that a random character \u03c7 : J/Q\u00d7 \u2192 Z/p2 Z,\nunramified at q, has image in pZ/p2 Z is\nP\n1\nY \u03c7:Z\u00d7l \u2192pZ/p2Z D(\u03c7)1/(p\nY\n2 \u2212p)\n(1 + (p \u2212 1)l\u22121 )\nP\nr=\n=\n.\n1\n\u22121 + (p2 \u2212 p)l\u2212(p+1)/p )\n(1\n+\n(p\n\u2212\n1)l\n\u00d7\n2Z\n2 \u2212p)\n1/(p\n\u03c7:Z\n\u2192Z/p\n2\nl6=q\nD(\u03c7)\n\nl\n\nl\u22611 or p (mod p )\nl6=q\n\nThus if s1 is the probability that a random surjective character to Z/p2 Z is trivial at q, given\nthat it is unramified at q, we have\ns \u2212 pr\ns1 =\n1\u2212r\nand thus s1 >\nY\n\nl\u22611 or p (mod p2 )\nq6\u2208Qpl\nl6=q\n\n1\np2\n\nif and only if\n\np2 s\u22121\n(p\u22121)r\n\n> 1.

In\nconclusion, the probability that a random Z/9Z-extension of Q splits completely at q, given\nthat it is unramified at q, is less than 19 for q = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13.\n\n5\n\nFair Artin Conductors\n\nFor any faithful finite dimensional complex representation R of G and G-extension L, we\nhave the Artin conductor C R (L), which is a counting function (as defined in the beginning of\nSection 2). If R is not faithful, then the Artin conductor is not a counting function because\nit will have cR\nG (g) = 0 for non-trivial g. We have seen that for fair counting functions, the\n27\n\n\fprobabilities of local behaviors are nice, but in Section 4, we saw that for an example of an\nunfair counting function, the probabilities are not so well-behaved. In this section, we give\ntwo simple examples of Artin conductors which give fair counting functions.\nFor a general definition of Artin conductors, see [21, VII.11]. The discriminant is given\nby the Artin conductor of the regular representation. Since we are only concerned with G\nabelian, any representation R breaks up as a sum of one dimensional representations, each of\nwhich is determined by the kernel of the action of G on that one dimensional representation.\nSuppose R is given by kernels H1 ,. . . ,Hs . Then for g \u2208 G, we have cR\nG (g) = s \u2212 #{i|g \u2208\nHi }. This can serve as a definition of the Artin conductor at all tame places, which is all\nthat concerns fairness. In other words, for a character \u03c7 : Kv\u00d7 \u2192 G for v \u2224 |G|, we have\ncR (\u03c7) = cR\nG (\u03c7(yv )), where yv is a generator of tame inertia. Recall that mR is the minimum\nR \u22121\nvalue, other than 0, taken by cR\nG , and M = MR = (cG ) (m). The counting function is fair\nr\nif M \u2229 {g \u2208 G | g r =\nQ1} generates the subgroup {g \u2208 G | g =\u2217 1} for all r.\nWe write G = i Z/ni Z, and let fi : G \u2192 Z/ni Z \u0592\u2192 C be the projection of G to a\nfactor composed with an injection to C\u2217 . Then \u2295i fi gives a fair Artin conductor. Since\nthe representation is faithful, the Artin conductor of \u2295i fi is a counting function. Also, the\nelements of M are exactly the elements of G that are in all but one ker fi , and these are\nthe elements with non-zero coordinates in exactly one factor of G. These elements of M\ngenerate N\nG in every\nL exponent, and thus the Artin conductorTis fair.\nN\nAlso,\nf\n\u2295\nf\nhas\na\nfair\nArtin\nconductor.\nWe\nhave\nker\nf\n=\n{1}\nand\nker\n(\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni fi ) \u2229\nT\ni6=j ker fi = {1}, and so the\nN elements of M are exactly the elements of G that are in all but\ntwo of the ker fi and ker ( i fi ). The elements of G with non-zero coordinates in exactly\none factor are in M, and they generate G in every exponent, and thus in this case the\nArtin conductor is fair. We can apply these two examples of fair Artin conductors to other\nfactorizations of G into cyclic groups to obtain more examples of fair Artin conductors.\n\n6\n\nFurther Questions\n\nOne may ask whether counting abelian extensions by conductor or discriminant is more natural. In this paper, we have seen that the probabilities of local behaviors are very nice when\ncounting by conductor and not so well behaved when counting by discriminant. While in\nboth cases we can obtain asymptotic counting results for the total number of extensions (see\nSection 3 and [28]), in the case of conductor we can express the constant in the asymptotic\ncount as an Euler product (see Theorem 3.1). No Euler product is known for the constant\ncounting abelian extensions by discriminant for a general group G and base field K. So it\nseems for abelian groups G, counting by conductor gives more natural answers.\nThe other main examples where this global asymptotic counting and computation of local\nproabilities can be done are for degree n extensions with Galois closure with group Sn for\nn = 3, 4, 5 (see [11], [3], [4]). In these cases the counting is done by discriminant, and in fact\nit is not clear what we might mean by conductor in these cases. Perhaps one should define\nthe conductor to be the greatest common divisor of all Artin conductors. In [2] the present\nauthor and Bhargava count these S3 extensions another way; equivalently, we count Galois\n28\n\n\fdegree 6 extensions with Galois group S3 by their discriminant. In this case, we obtain an\nasymptotic for the overall count with an Euler product constant and nice local behaviors\n(simple ratios of probabilities at a given place, and independence at any finite set of places).\nIn [2] it is remarked that one can obtain all these nice behaviors for a range of counting\nfunctions.\nFor quartic extensions of Q having Galois closure with Galois group D4 the overall asymptotic counting by discriminant has been completed (see [9]), but the constant has not been\nfound to have a simple form, and no results for local probabilities analogous to those in this\npaper have been found. We wonder if counting these D4 extensions another way would yield\nnicer results. In particular, see [26, Section 5] for a specific counting function one might\ninvestigate.\nEllenberg and Venkatesh [15, Section 4.2] suggest that we can try to count extensions\nof global fields by general counting functions (our terminology). The larger question that\nis motivated by this paper is which of these counting functions are better than others. For\nwhich counting functions can we obtain an asymptotic total count? For which counting\nfunctions is the constant in the asymptotic total count an Euler product? And for which\ncounting functions are the local probabilities simple and independent at finite sets of places?\nThese questions are exactly in line with the questions of Bhargava in [5, Section 8.2], except\nhe asks these questions mainly for counting by discriminant and here we emphasize that the\nanswers will depend on the choice of counting function.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
