The E 8 model which follows from the affine E 8 Toda field theory\npredicts 8 bound states with the mass relations in the increasing order\n1\uf02b 5\nrepresents the\nm1 , m2 \uf03d \uf074m1 , m3 , m4 , m5 , m6 \uf03d \uf074m3 , m7 \uf03d \uf074m4 , m8 \uf03d \uf074m5 , where \uf074 \uf03d\n2\ngolden ratio. Above relations follow from the fact that the Coxeter group W (H 4 ) is a\nmaximal subgroup of the Coxeter-Weyl group W (E 8 ).

Using the S-matrix approach Zamolodchikov predicted that the masses of the\nbound states of the 1D Ising model can be determined, in the increasing order, as\nm1 , m 2 \uf03d \uf074 m1 , m 3 , m 4 , m 5 , m 6 \uf03d \uf074 m 3 , m 7 \uf03d \uf074 m 4 , m 8 \uf03d \uf074 m 5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m1 is a free parameter and m 3 , m 4 , m 5 and \uf074 are given by\nm 3 \uf03d 2m1 cos\n\n\uf070\n30\n\n, m 4 \uf03d 2m 2 cos\n\n7\uf070\n2\uf070\n\uf070 1\uf02b 5\n, m 5 =2m 2cos\nand \uf074 \uf03d 2cos \uf03d\n.\n30\n15\n5\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe team led by R. Coldea have indications for the first two mass excitations with the masses\nm1 \uf0bb 0.5 meV and m 2 \uf0bb \uf074 m1.\nThe integrable field theories and the 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories were very\nattractive research areas during the late 80's and early 90's. It was shown that, in the\ncontinuum limit, the 1D Ising model perturbed with an external magnetic field, can be\nrepresented by the affine Toda field theory of E 8 [3] which corresponds to the perturbed Toda\nfield theory of E 8 . The Lagrangian of the affine Toda field theory is given by\n\nL \uf03d\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf06d\n\n\uf0b6 \uf066 \uf0b6 \uf06d\uf066 \uf02d\na\n\na\n\nm\n\n\uf062\n\n2\n\nl\n\n\uf0e5n\n\ni\n\nexp{\uf062\uf061 i .\uf066 }\n\n(3)\n\ni \uf03d0\nl\n\nwhere the eigenvalues of the mass matrix M\n\nab\n\n\uf03d m 2 \uf0e5 n i \uf061 i a\uf061 i b can be related to the matrix\ni \uf03d0\n\n8\n\nNij \uf03d m2 \uf0e5 ni\uf061i a\uf061 j a [4]. Here \uf061 i (i \uf03d 1,2,...,8) are the simple roots and n i\n\ndenote the\n\na \uf03d1\n\ncoefficients of the highest root of the E8 Lie algebra [5]. One should also recall that the\ncoefficients ni , together with 1, correspond to dimensions of the irreducible representations of\nthe binary icosahedral group [6]. If the characteristic polynomial of the mass matrix is given\nby the function f (x) the characteristic polynomial of the singular matrix N is given by xf (x).\nSquare roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix N, besides zero eigenvalue, lead to the masses\ngiven in equations (1-2). P. Dorey [7] has shown that the radii of the circles obtained by\nprojecting the root systems of the simple laced Lie Algebras are proportional to the masses of\nthe scalar particles of the Affine Toda field theories. A similar work was carried out earlier by\nH.W. Braden [8] in the context of \"fusing rule\". B. Kostant [9] has shown that the mass\nmatrix can be associated with an operator defined in the dual bases and its eigenvalues\ncorrespond to the masses of the scalar particles obtained from the Affine Toda field theory. In\nparticular, he has shown that the radii of 8 Gosset circles obtained by projecting on the\nCoxeter plane 240 vertices of the Gosset polytope are proportional to the masses given in (1).\n\n2\n\n\fIn what follows we derive the same results with a simpler technique by projecting the E 8\nlattice to the Coxeter plane defined by the simple roots of its maximal dihedral subgroup D 30\ncorresponding to the Coxeter diagram I 2 (30). We also note that the four of the masses related\nto the other four masses by a factor of \uf074 happen to be that the Coxeter-Weyl group W (E 8 )\nadmits the non-crystallographic Coxeter group W (H 4 ) as a maximal subgroup.\nEvery Coxeter-Weyl group has a maximal dihedral group, up to conjugation, with an order 2h\nwhere h is the Coxeter number. The dihedral group of order 2h can be represented by the\nCoxeter graph I 2 (h ) .

Writing two sets of equations in the matrix form\n\n\uf062i \uf03d g ij \uf061 j (i , j \uf03d 1, 2,...,8) where \uf0625 \uf03d \uf0621\uf0a2, \uf0626 \uf03d \uf0622\uf0a2 , \uf0627 \uf03d \uf0623\uf0a2, \uf0628 \uf03d \uf0624\uf0a2\none can check that the Cartan matrix of E8 is block diagonalized where the upper and the lower\nblock matrices represent the Cartan matrices of the Coxeter diagram H 4 with the angles\nbetween the third and the fourth roots of the upper and lower blocks are respectively 1440 and\n720[11].\nLet us now define reflection generators and simple roots of the Coxeter diagram I2(30) by\nS 1 \uf03d R1R 3 , S 2 \uf03d R 2 R 4 , \uf067 i \uf03d z ia \uf062a , (i \uf03d 1, 2; a \uf03d 1, 2,3, 4),\n\nwith the relations (\uf067 1 , \uf067 1 ) \uf03d (\uf067 2 , \uf067 2 ) \uf03d 2, (\uf067 1 , \uf067 2 ) \uf03d \uf02dc, c \uf03d 2cos\n\n(7)\n\n\uf070\n\n.\n30\nUsing the fact that S1\uf067 1 \uf03d \uf02d\uf067 1 and S 2\uf067 2 \uf03d \uf02d\uf067 2 , the expression in (7) can further be reduced\nto the equations\n\n\uf067 1 \uf03d z 1\uf0621 \uf02b z 3 \uf062 3 , \uf067 2 \uf03d z 2 \uf062 2 \uf02b z 4 \uf062 4 .\n\n(8)\n\nNow using the relations S1\uf067 2 \uf03d \uf067 2 \uf02b c\uf067 1 , S 2\uf067 1 \uf03d \uf067 1 \uf02b c\uf067 2 one can determine the coefficients\nas\n\n4\n\n\fz2 \uf03d cz1; z3 \uf03d (c 2 \uf02d 1) z1 \uf03d (2\uf074 cos\n\n2\uf070\n\uf074 (c2 \uf02d 1)\n7\uf070\n) z1; z4 \uf03d\nz1 \uf03d (2\uf074 cos ) z1.\n15\nc\n30\n\n(9)\n\nTheir numerical values can be determined through the root normalizations as\nz 1 \uf0bb 0.3204, z 2 \uf03d 0.6373, z 3 \uf03d 0.9473, z 4 \uf03d 0.7706.\n\nNote the relations in (9) can be obtained from the eigenvalue equation\n\uf0e60\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e71\n\uf0e70\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e80\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n0 0 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 z1 \uf0f6\n\uf0e6 z1 \uf0f6\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\uf0e7 z \uf0f7\nz\n1 0\uf0f7\uf0e7 2 \uf0f7\n\uf03d c\uf0e7 2 \uf0f7,\n\uf0e7 z3 \uf0f7\n0 \uf074 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 z3 \uf0f7\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf074 0 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 z4 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 z4 \uf0f8\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the matrix in (10) is (2 I \uf02d C H 4 ) with the matrix C H 4 is the Cartan matrix of the H 4\ndiagram. Due to the Perron-Frobenius theorem the components of the eigenvector are positive\nsince c is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix in (10). Now the expression in (8) can be\nrewritten in terms of the simple roots of E8 as follows\n\n1\n1\n[z 1 (\uf0611 \uf02b \uf074\uf061 7 ) \uf02b z 3 (\uf0613 \uf02b \uf074\uf0615 )], \uf067 2 \uf03d\n[z 2 (\uf061 2 \uf02b \uf074\uf061 6 ) \uf02b z 4 (\uf074\uf061 4 \uf02b \uf0618 )].\n2 \uf02b\uf074\n2 \uf02b\uf074\n\n\uf0671 \uf03d\n\n(11)\n\nWe note that these 8 coefficients z1 , \u03c4z1 , z 2 , \u03c4z 2 , z 3 , \u03c4z 3 , z 4 , \u03c4z 4 can be directly obtained as the\ncomponents of the eigenvector of the matrix (2 I \uf02d C E 8 ) corresponding to the largest eigenvalue\n\n\uf070\n\nc \uf03d 2 cos( ). The plane defined by the simple roots \uf067 1 and \uf067 2 of the Coxeter graph is known\n30\nas the Coxeter plane of the E 8 lattice. Any vector of the E 8 lattice can be projected on to the\nplane using the simple roots in (11).\n\nWe will discuss two cases of projections: orthogonal projections and non-orthogonal\nprojections. For an orthogonal projection one can define the orthogonal unit vectors in the\nCoxeter plane as follows\n\uf067\n\uf067\n1\nc \uf0671\ni\u02c6 \uf03d 1 , j\u02c6 \uf03d\n( 2 \uf02b\n).\n(12)\n\uf070\n2\n2 2 2\nsin\n30\nThe 240 vertices of the E8 Gosset polytope are mapped on the Coxeter plane by using the\northogonal projection. One can prove that E8 root system can be decomposed under the\ndihedral subgroup D30 \uf03d \uf0e1 S1 , S 2 \uf0f1 into 8 orbits each containing 30 roots and each orbit is\n\n5\n\n\fcharacterized by one simple root \uf061 i (i \uf03d 1,2,..., 8). Under the orthogonal projection each \uf061 i orbit determines a circle of radius ri given in the increasing order by\n2\n2\n2\nr1 \uf03d \uf0611\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz1 , r2 = \uf061 7\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r1 , r3 \uf03d \uf061 2\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz2 , r4 \uf03d \uf0618\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz4 ,\n2 \uf02b\uf074\n2 \uf02b\uf074\n2 \uf02b\uf074\n(13)\n2\nr5 \uf03d \uf061 3\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz3 , r6 = \uf061 6\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r3 , r7 = \uf061 4\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r4 , r8 = \uf061 5\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r5\n2 \uf02b\uf074\nwhere the norm of the image of the simple root \uf061 i on the Coxeter plane is denoted by \uf061 i\uf0a2 .\nRatios of these radii satisfy the same ratio satisfied by the masses of the bound states. We also\nnote that the norms of images of the fundamental weight vectors satisfy the same ratios of the\nmasses. Therefore one can associate the radii of the Gosset circles up to a scale factor to the\nmasses of the quasiparticle states of the Ising model. The relations in (13) also imply that the\ncomponents of the eigenvector of the Cartan matrix of E8 corresponding to the highest\neigenvalue are proportional to the masses of the exited states.\nThe image of the E8 lattice can also be determined by a non-orthogonal projection. In this case\nvectors of a given \uf061 i -orbit generated by the maximal dihedral subgroup D30 \uf03d \uf0e1 S1 , S 2 \uf0f1 do not\nmap on the same circle. Nevertheless the images of the E 8 lattice vectors form concentric\ncircles on the Coxeter plane with increasing radii. A particular projection of the E 8 lattice on\nthe Coxeter plane can be made by computing the components of the lattice vectors on the root\nvectors \uf067 1 and \uf067 2 of the dihedral group D30 \uf03d \uf0e1 S1 , S 2 \uf0f1 . The image of an arbitrary E 8 lattice\nvector on the Coxeter plane can be written as\n\uf067\n\uf067\n2\n2\n\uf04c \uf0a2 \uf03d \uf04c1 1 \uf02b \uf04c 2 2 with the norm of the image \uf04c\uf0a2 \uf03d (\uf04c1 \uf02b \uf04c 2 \uf02d \uf04c1\uf04c 2 c)1 2 .\n2\n2\nWith this projection the images of the simple roots will lie on different circles with radii in\nthe increasing order\n\nr1 \uf03d \uf0611\uf0a2 \uf03d\n\n4 \uf02b 3c 2\n4 \uf02b 3c 2\n4 \uf02b 3c 2\nz 1 , r2 = \uf061 7\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r1 , r3 \uf03d \uf061 2\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz 2 , r4 \uf03d \uf061 8\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz 4,\n2(2 \uf02b \uf074 )\n2(2 \uf02b \uf074 )\n2(2 \uf02b \uf074 )\n\n4 \uf02b 3c 2\nr5 \uf03d \uf061 3\uf0a2 \uf03d\nz 3 , r6 = \uf061 6\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r3 , r7 = \uf061 4\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r4 , r8 = \uf061 5\uf0a2 \uf03d \uf074 r5 .\n2(2 \uf02b \uf074 )\n\n(14)\n\nNumerical values of these radii are 0.4745, 0.7678, 0.9438, 1.141, 1.403, 1.527, 1.846 and\n2.270. It seems that these radii directly determine the masses of the bound states!\nThe first and the second radii are in agreement with the first two masses of the bound states\ndetermined by the Coldea et.al. We have no idea whether this is just a numerical coincidence\nor there is a deeper relation between the masses of these states and the radii of the circles just\ndetermined by the above non-orthogonal projection of the simple roots. We hope that the\n\n6\n\n\fabove simple algebraic analysis will shed some light on the evidence of the E 8 symmetry in\nthe quantum phase transition of the 1D Ising model. One should also note that the Coxeter\nplane of an arbitrary Weyl-Coxeter group can be determined in a similar manner.\nWe thank Ramazan Ko\u00e7 for discussions.\nReferences\n[1] R. Coldea, D.A.
