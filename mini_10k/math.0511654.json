Introduction\nLet us recall the main definitions from Universal Algebraic Geometry [23, 24].\nLet \u0398 be a variety of algebras over a commutative-associative ring K and F = F (X)\nbe a free algebra from \u0398 generated by a finite set X. Here X is supposed to be\na subset of some infinite universum X 0 . The set Hom(F, G), G \u2208 \u0398, can be\ntreated as an affine space whose points are homomorphisms. The algebraic set in\nHom(F, G) and the category K\u0398 (G) of algebraic sets over G can be defined. The\ncategory K\u0398 (G) is a geometric invariant of algebra G. Algebras G1 and G2 from\n\u0398 are categorically equivalent if the categories K\u0398 (G1 ) and K\u0398 (G2 ) are correctly\nisomorphic. Algebras G1 and G2 are geometrically equivalent if\nTG\u2032\u20321 = TG\u2032\u20322\nDate: November 27, 2005.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 08A35, 08C05, 17B01.\nKey words and phrases.

LIPYANSKI\n\nholds for all finite sets X and for all binary relations T on F and \u2032 is Galois\ncorrespondence between sets in Hom(F, G) and the binary relations on F .\nIt has been shown in [24] that categorical and geometrical equivalences of algebras are related and their relation is determined by the structure of the group\nAut \u03980 , where \u03980 is the category of free finitely generated algebras of \u0398. Note\nthat the category \u03980 is small. The group Aut \u03980 is known for the following varieties: the variety of all groups, the variety of F -groups, where F is a free group\nof constants, the variety of all semigroups, the variety of commutative-associative\nalgebras with unit element over infinite fields, the variety of associative algebras\nover infinite fields, the variety of all Lie algebras over infinite fields, the variety of\nmodules over IBN -rings [2, 3, 15, 16, 20, 21, 27].\nThere is a natural connection between a structure of the groups Aut End F, F \u2208\n\u0398, and Aut \u03980 . However, a problem of description of the group Aut End F is\nmore complicated and was solved only for the following varieties: the variety of\ninverse semigroup, the variety of semigroups, the variety of groups, the variety of\nassociative-commutative algebras over infinite fields, and the variety of Lie algebras\nover infinite fields [4, 8, 19, 20, 27].\nWe define a class of R1 MF-domains, containing Bezout domains, unique factorization domains, and some other domains. Namely, a domain K is called R1 MFdomain if each n \u00d7 m matrix A over K of rank 1 can be represented as a product\nof an n \u00d7 1 matrix by an 1 \u00d7 m matrix over K. Here by the rank of matrix we\nunderstand its rank over the quotient field K\u0303 of K.\nOur aim here is to describe the group Aut End F and, as a consequence, to\nobtain a description of the group Aut \u03980 for the variety of Lie algebras and the\nvariety of nilpotent associative algebras over R1 MF-domains.\nThe main theorems are as follows:\nTheorem A. Let L be the variety of Lie algebras over an R1 MF-domain K and\nF = F (x1 , .., xn ) be a finitely generated free Lie algebra of L. Then any automorphism of the group Aut End F is semi-inner.\nThis Theorem solves\nLie algebras over fields.\nvariety of Lie algebras\nAut End F (x1 , .., xn ), n\nwas described in [27].\n\nProblem 5.1 in [21] formulated there for the variety of\nThe description of the group AutEnd F (x1 , x2 ) for the\nover infinite fields has been given in [21]. The group\n\u2265 2, for the variety of Lie algebras over infinite fields\n\nTheorem B. Let Nm be the variety of m-nilpotent (m \u2265 2) associative algebras\nover an R1 MF-domain K and Fm = Fm (X), |X| < \u221e, be a finitely generated free\nalgebra of the variety Nm . The following three statements hold:\n1. If either\n(a) |K| = pk , k \u2265 1, p 6= 2, and pk |m \u2212 1, and m = 2r, r > 1,\nor\n(b) |K| = 2k , k \u2265 1, (i.e. p = 2), and 2k | m \u2212 1,\nthen the group Aut End Fm is generated by semi-inner, p-semi-inner, mirror and\np-mirror automorphisms of End Fm .\n2. If |K| = \u221e or |K| = pk , k \u2265 1, and either\n(c) pk |m \u2212 1 and m = 2r + 1, r \u2265 0,\nor\n(d) pk \u2224 m \u2212 1 and m 6= 2,\n\n\fTHE SEMIGROUP OF ENDOMORPHISMS OF FREE ALGEBRAS OF VARIETIES\n\n3\n\nthen the group Aut End Fm is generated by semi-inner and mirror automorphisms\nof End Fm .\n3. If K is any R1 MF-domain and m = 2, i.e., the multiplication in Fm is trivial,\nthen any automorphism of the group Aut End Fm is semi-inner.\nFrom part (3) of this theorem follows easily\nCorollary 1.1. Let Mn (K) be the full matrix semigroup of n \u00d7 n matrices over a\nR1 MF-domain K. Then any automorphism of Mn (K) is a semi-inner.\nThis result generalizes [13] on automorphisms of the full matrix semigroups of\nn \u00d7 n matrices over principal ideal domains (see also [9], [10], where this result has\nbeen proved for the full matrix semigroup over fields).\nUsing Theorem A we further prove\nTheorem C. Every automorphism of the category L\u25e6 of Lie algebras over an\nR1 MF-domain is semi-inner.\nEarlier, this theorem has been proved for the case of Lie algebras over infinite\n\u25e6\nfields [21]. Using Theorem B, a description of automorphisms of the category Nm\ncan be derived.\nWe give also an example of variety \u0398 of linear algebras over a Dedekind domain\nfor which the group AutEnd F contains an automorphism which is not quasi-inner.\nNote that all automorphisms of End F are quasi-inner in all above-mentioned varieties of algebras over R1 MF-domains.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. We prove that all automorphisms of End F\nfor the varieties B2 and Nm are quasi-inner (see Theorem 5.3). Then we describe the\nbijections related to these quasi-inner automorphisms. To this end we investigate\nthe structure of derivative algebras associated with quasi-inner automorphisms (see\nPropositions 6.6 and 6.7). Such a relation between quasi-inner automorphisms and\nderivative algebras was noted first in [27]. We prove the main statements of our\npaper, Theorems A, B, C, and discuss the relation between the categorical and\ngeometrical equivalences of Lie algebras over R1 MF-domains (see Remark 7.1).\nFinally, we give the description of quasi-inner automorphisms of the semigroup\nEnd A(X) for the variety of associative algebras over domains.\n2. Automorphisms of the semigroup End F and of the category \u03980\nThroughout this paper \"ring\" will mean \"commutative-associative ring with 1\".\nLet F = F (x1 , ..., xn ) be a free algebra of a variety \u0398 of linear algebras over ring\nK generated by a set X = {x1 , ..., xn }.\nDefinition 2.1. [2] An automorphism \u03a6 of the semigroup End F of endomorphisms of F is called quasi-inner if there exists a bijection s : F \u2192 F such that\n\u03a6(\u03bd) = s\u03bds\u22121 , for any \u03bd \u2208 End F ; s is called adjoint to \u03a6.\nDefinition 2.2. [23] A quasi-inner automorphism \u03a6 of End F is called semi-inner\nif its adjoint bijection s : F \u2192 F satisfies the following conditions:\n1. s(a + b) = s(a) + s(b),\n2. s(a * b) = s(a) * s(b),\n3. s(\u03b1a) = \u03c6(\u03b1)s(a),\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 K and a, b \u2208 F and an automorphism \u03c6 : K \u2192 K. If \u03c6 is the identity\nautomorphism of K, we say that \u03a6 is an inner.\n\n\f4\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\nLet A = A(x1 , ..., xn ) be a finitely generated free associative algebra of the variety\nAss-K of associative algebras over K.\nDefinition 2.3. [19] A quasi-inner automorphism \u03a6 of End A is called mirror if\nits adjoint bijection s : A \u2192 A is anti-automorphism of A.\nNow we introduce a new class of quasi-inner automorphisms. Let A = A(X) be\na free finitely generated associative algebra over a ring K of characteristic p > 0.\nDefinition 2.4. A quasi-inner automorphism \u03a6 of End A is called p-semi-inner\n(p-mirror) if \u03a6p is a semi-inner (a mirror) automorphism of End A, whereas \u03a6p\u22121\nis not.\nRecall the notions of category isomorphism and equivalence [17]. An isomorphism \u03c6 : C \u2192 D of categories is a functor \u03c6 from C to D which is a bijection both\non objects and morphisms.

Quasi-inner automorphisms of End F for varieties of linear\nalgebras\nNow we introduce standard endomorphisms in free algebra F = F (x1 , ..., xn ) of\na variety \u0398.\nDefinition 3.1. Standard endomorphisms of F in the base X = {x1 , ..., xn } are\nthe endomorphisms eij of F which are determined on the free generators xk \u2208 X\nby the rule: eij (xk ) = \u03b4jk xi , xi \u2208 X, i, j, k \u2208 [1n], \u03b4jk is the Kronecker delta.\nDenote by S0 a subsemigroup of End F generated by eij , i, j \u2208 [1n].\n\nProposition 3.2. Let \u03a6 \u2208 Aut End F (X). Elements of the semigroup \u03a6(S0 ) are\nstandard endomorphisms in some base U = {u1 , ..., un } of F if and only if \u03a6 is a\nquasi-inner automorphism of End F .\nProof. Let \u03a6 be a quasi-inner automorphism of End F . Consider the endomorphisms \u03c3 and \u03c4 of F given on generators xi \u2208 X by the following rules: \u03c3(xi ) = s(xi )\nand \u03c4 (xi ) = s\u22121 (xi ), i \u2208 [1n]. Let \u03c1 = \u03a6(\u03c4 )\u03c3. Then for any xi \u2208 X we have:\n\u03c1(xi ) = s\u03c4 s\u22121 \u03c3(xi ) = s\u03c4 s\u22121 s(xi ) = s\u03c4 (xi ) = xi , i \u2208 [1n],\ni.e., \u03c1 = IdF = \u03a6(\u03c4 )\u03c3, where IdF is the identical mapping on F . Replacing \u03a6\nby \u03a6\u22121 we obtain: IdF = \u03a6\u22121 (\u03c4 )\u03c3. Consequently, IdF = \u03c4 \u03a6(\u03c3). Hence \u03c3 is an\nautomorphism of F .\nNow we prove that s(0) = 0. For every \u03b6 \u2208 End F we have \u03a6(\u03b6)(0) = s\u03b6s\u22121 (0) =\n0, i.e., \u03b6s\u22121 (0) = s\u22121 (0). Assume that \u03b6 is the zero endomorphism of F . Then\ns\u22121 (0) = \u03b6(s\u22121 (0)) = 0.\nConsider the following elements u1 , ..., un from F :\nu1 = \u03c3(x1 ) = s(x1 ), ..., un = \u03c3(xn ) = s(xn ).\nSince \u03c3 is an automorphism of F , u1 , ..., un is a base of F . Let us show that\nendomorphisms \u03a6(eij ), i, j \u2208 1, .., n are standard endomorphisms in the base U =\n{u1 , ..., un } :\n\n\u03a6(eij )(uk ) = seij s\u22121 \u03c3(xk ) = seij s\u22121 s(xk ) = seij (xk ) = s(\u03b4jk xi ) = \u03b4jk s(xi ) = \u03b4jk ui\n\nConversely, let \u03a6(eij ), i, j \u2208 [1n], be standard endomorphisms of F in a base\nU = {u1 , ..., un }. Denote by \u03bcka , a \u2208 F, k \u2208 [1n], endomorphisms of F given on\n\n\f6\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\ngenerators X by the rules: \u03bcka (um ) = \u03b4km a, um \u2208 U . Then \u03bcka ekk = \u03bcka . It is\nclear that if \u03c1ekk = \u03c1 for some k and \u03c1 \u2208 End F , then there exists a \u2208 F , such that\n\u03c1 = \u03bcka .\nLet, for k = 1, \u03bc1a e11 = \u03bc1a . Then \u03a6(\u03bc1a )\u03a6(e11 ) = \u03a6(\u03bc1a ). Since \u03a6(e11 ) is\na matrix identity of F in the base U , there exists an element s(a) \u2208 F such that\n\u03a6(\u03bc1a ) = \u03bc1s(a) . Note that \u03a6 is an automorphism of F , hence s is a bijection\nof F . Since \u03c1\u03bc1a = \u03bc1\u03c1(a) for any \u03c1 \u2208 End F , we have \u03a6(\u03c1)\u03a6(\u03bc1a ) = \u03a6(\u03bc1\u03c1(a) ).\nTherefore, \u03a6(\u03c1)\u03bc1s(a) (u1 ) = \u03bc1s(\u03c1(a)) (u1 ). Thus, \u03a6(\u03c1)s(a) = s\u03c1(a), a \u2208 F , i.e.\n\u03a6(\u03c1) = s\u03c1s\u22121 .\n\u0003\nRemark 3.3. It is easy to show that the construction of the bijection s : F \u2192 F in\nthe above proof does not depend on the choice of k.\nRemark 3.4. From the proof of this Proposition we see also that the bijection s\ntransforms every base X of F into a base of the same algebra.\nNow we define a notion of base X\u03c3 -matrix of an automorphism \u03a6 \u2208 AutEnd F .\nDefinition 3.5. Let \u03c3 be an element of the symmetric group Sn . The matrix\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\nTX = (tij ), where tij = \u03a6(eij )x\u03c3(j) , xi \u2208 X, i, j \u2208 [1n], is called X\u03c3 -matrix of\n\u03a6 in base X.\nThe following Lemma establishes a useful property of X\u03c3 -matrix of an automorphism \u03a6 we need below.\nLemma 3.6. Let \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n be endomorphisms of F = F (x1 , ..., xn ). Then there\nexists an endomorphism \u03b1 of F such that\n(\u03c3)\n\n(\u03c3)\n\n\u03b1(tij ) = \u03b1i (tij )\n\n(3.1)\n\nfor all i, j \u2208 [1n] and some \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . There exists a unique endomorphism \u03b1 of F\nsuch that (3.1) is fulfilled for all i, j \u2208 [1n] and all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn .\n\nProof. Let \u03b2i = \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b1i ) and \u03b2i (xi ) = yi , i \u2208 [1n]. Determine an endomorphism\n\u03b2 \u2208 End F on free generators X of F in the following way: \u03b2(xi ) = yi , i \u2208 [1n] and\nlet \u03b1 = \u03a6(\u03b2). Since \u03b2eij = \u03b2i eij , we have \u03a6(\u03b2)\u03a6(eij )x\u03c3(j) = \u03a6(\u03b2i )\u03a6(eij )x\u03c3(j) for\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\nsome \u03c3 \u2208 Sn and all i, j \u2208 [1n]. Therefore, \u03b1(tij ) = \u03b1i (tij ) for all i, j \u2208 [1n] and\nsome \u03c3 \u2208 Sn .\nLet (3.1) be fulfilled for all i, j \u2208 [1n] and all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . We wish to prove the\nuniqueness of \u03b1. Assume, on the contrary, that there exists \u03b3 \u2208 End F such that\n(\u03c3)\n\n(\u03c3)\n\n\u03b3(tij ) = \u03b1i (tij ), i.e., \u03b3\u03a6(eij )(x\u03c3(j) ) = \u03b1i \u03a6(eij )(x\u03c3(j) )\nfor all i, j \u2208 [1n] and all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . Then \u03b1\u03a6(eij ) = \u03b3\u03a6(eij ) for all i, j \u2208 [1n]. Thus,\n\u03a6\u22121 (\u03b1)eij = \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b3)eij and, as a consequence, \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b1)eij xj = \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b3)eij xj , i.e.,\n\u03a6\u22121 (\u03b1)xi = \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b3)xi for all i. We arrive at \u03b1 = \u03b3.\n\u0003\n4. R1 MF-domains\nLet K be an integral domain (domain, for short) and K\u0303 = F rac K be the\nquotient field of K.\nDefinition 4.1. Rank of a matrix A \u2208 Mn\u00d7m (K) is the rank of A over the field\nK\u0303, i.e., rankK A := rankK\u0303 A.\n\n\fTHE SEMIGROUP OF ENDOMORPHISMS OF FREE ALGEBRAS OF VARIETIES\n\n7\n\nDefinition 4.2. We say that a domain K satisfies the rank-1-matrix factorization\ncondition (R1 MF-condition) if each n \u00d7 m matrix A over K of rank 1 can be\npresented as a product of an n \u00d7 1 matrix ci by an 1 \u00d7 m matrix di over K, i.e.,\nA = ci * di . A domain K with R1 MF condition is called R1 MF-domain.\nNow we will give several examples of R1 MF-domains.\nExample 4.3. An n \u00d7 m matrix A is equivalent to an n \u00d7 m matrix B over a\ndomain K if there exist invertible matrices P and Q such that A = P BQ. Recall\n(see [14]) that an elementary divisor domain (EDD, for short) K is a domain with\nthe property that each matrix A over K is equivalent to a diagonal matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nd1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nd2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\ndiag (d1 , d2 , ...) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n..\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n0\n\nwhere di divides di+1 for all i.\nFor instance, any principal ideal domain is EDD. It is clear that each EDD is an\nR1 MF-domain.\nExample 4.4. A Bezout domain is a domain in which any finitely generated ideal\nis principal, (see [6, 11]). By [6], Proposition 4.4, every Bezout domain is an R1 MFdomain. Note that every EDD is a Bezout domain. However, inverse inclusion is\nstill an open question (see [11]).\nExample 4.5. Let K be a unique factorization domain (UFD, for short). Let us\nshow that K is an R1 MF-domain.\nLet A = (aij ) \u2208 Mn\u00d7m (K) and rank A = 1. Then there exists g \u2208 K such\nthat gA = c1 * d1 , where c1 = (ck1 ) and d1 = (d1k ), k \u2208 [1n], ck1 , d1k \u2208 K. Thus\ngaij = ci1 d1j . Assume that g = p is a prime element in K. Since K is UFD, we\nhave p|ci1 or p|d1j . If p|ci1 for all i then our statement is true. Let there exist s \u2264 n\nsuch that p|ck1 for all k < s but p \u2224 cs1 . Then p|d1j for all j and this yields the\nassertion.\nNow, let g be a non-prime element in K. We can represent g = p1 ...pr , r > 1,\nwhere all pi are prime elements in K. Using induction on r we obtain the proof of\nthis statement in the general case.\nNote that the group algebra over field P of the additive group of rational numbers\n(written multiplicatively) is a Bezout domain but not UFD (see [6], exercise 3.5 ).\nThis suggests that the classes of UFDs and of R1 MF-domains do not coincide.\nNow consider an example of domain which is not an R1 MF-domain.\nExample 4.6. A domain K with quotient field K\u0303 is called a Dedekind domain if\nit satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:\n(i) every ideal in K is projective;\n(ii) every nonzero ideal C of K is invertible (that is CC \u22121 = K, where C \u22121 =\n{x \u2208 K\u0303|xa \u2282 K}.\n\u221aAs follows from Corollary 5.6 (or Remark 5.7) the Dedekind domain K = {a +\nb \u22125 | a, b \u2208 Z} is not an R1 MF-domain.\nIt is proved in [14] that a domain K is EDD if and only if every 2 \u00d7 1 and\n2 \u00d7 2 matrices over K are equivalent to a diagonal matrix. Our hypothesis is: a\n\n\f8\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\ndomain K is R1 MF-domain if and only if each 2 \u00d7 2 matrix over K of rank 1 can\nbe represented as a column-by-row product.\nNote that there is a notion of rank of matrix over any ring (see, for example, [6],\n[11]). Thus the notion of R1 MF-domain can be generalized to non-commutative\nrings. In future we are going to study such a generalization.\nLet V be a free module of finite rank n over an R1 MF-domain K, P be a subsemigroup of End V generated by non-zero elements Pij \u2208 End V, i, j \u2208 [1n] such that\nPij Pmk = \u03b4jm Pik , Pij 6= 0, for every i, j, k, m \u2208 [1n]. Denote by E a subsemigroup\nof End V generated by the elementary matrices Eij in a basis B = hv1 , ..., vn i of\nthe free module V , i.e., Eij (vk ) = \u03b4jk vi , i, j, k \u2208 [1n].\nLemma 4.7. The semigroup P and E are conjugate via an automorphism \u03c1 of V .\nN\nProof. Denote by VK\u0303 = V\nK K\u0303 a vector space over the quotient field K\u0303 of the\ndomain K Let dim VK\u0303 = n. Since P11 6= 0, there exists u \u2208 V such that u1 =\nP11 u 6= 0. Let ui = Pi1 u1 , i \u2208 [1n]. It is easy to check that the ordered set B1 =\nhui \u2208 V |i \u2208 [1n]i forms a basis of the vector space VK\u0303 . Denote by f1 (Pij ), i, j \u2208 [1n]\nthe matrices of the elements Pij in the basis B1 . Then f1 (Pij ) = Eij , i, j \u2208 [1n].\nFrom this follows that the rank of every f1 (Pij ) over K is 1. Since K is an R1 MFdomain, we can represent f1 (Pii ) = ai bi , where ai = (asi ), asi \u2208 K, s \u2208 [1n], is an\nn \u00d7 1 matrix and bi = (bis ), bis \u2208 K, s \u2208 [1n], is an 1 \u00d7 n matrix. Denote A = (aij )\nand B = (bij ). Since\nf1 (Pii )f1 (Pjj ) = \u03b4ij f1 (Pii ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nbik akj ai bj ,\n\nk=1\n\u22121\n\nwe obtain BA = I. Hence, A f1 (Pii )A = Eii , i \u2208 [1n]. We may assume that\nf1 (Pii ) = Eii for any i in a basis B2 = hwi \u2208 V |i \u2208 [1n]i of the module V over\nK. Since Pij = Pii Pij Pjj , there exist dij \u2208 K such that f1 (Pij ) = dij Eij . It is\nclear that dij dmk = \u03b4jm dik , dii = 1 for all i, j, k, m \u2208 [1n] and dij are units in K.\n\u22121\nConsider B3 = hvi \u2208 V |vi = d1i\nwi , i \u2208 [1n]i, a basis of the module V over K. It is\neasy to check that the elements Pij can be represented by the elementary matrices\nin this basis. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\n5. Homogeneous varieties of algebras and quasi-inner automorphisms\nof End F\nLet \u0398 be a variety of linear algebras over a ring K and T (\u0398) be its T-ideal.\nDefinition 5.1. [26] The variety \u0398 is called homogeneous if its T-ideal T (\u0398) is a\nhomogeneous.\nIt is known that the varieties of associative algebras, of nilpotent associative\nalgebras, of Lie algebras, of alternative algebras, of Jordan algebras (if 1/2 \u2208 K)\nare homogeneous varieties ([26]).\nFurther, we consider only homogeneous varieties with free algebras without 1.\nA free algebra F (X) of such a variety can be naturally decomposed as\n\u221e\nM\n(i) F (X) =\nF (k) and (ii) F (k) F (m) \u2286 F (k+m) ,\nk=1\n\n(k)\n\nwhere F\nis a K-submodule\ngenerated by all monomial of F (X) of degree k.\nL\u221e\nDenote by F \u2032 = k=2 F (k) .

Thus, Akl Als = Aks . Since mij 6= 0,\n(\u03c3)\n\nwe have Aij 6= 0 for some i, j \u2208 [1n] and \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . From this it follows that the\n(\u03c3)\n\nmatrices Alm 6= 0 for all l, m \u2208 [1n]. Consequently, \u03c8 is a monomorphism.

Now we have to prove that the elements\nof Z form a base of F . Let e\u2032ij , i, j \u2208 [1n] be the standard endomorphisms of F in\nthe base Y , i.e., e\u2032ij (yk ) = \u03b4jk yi , i, j, k \u2208 [1n]. Applying e\u2032ii to (5.3), we obtain\ne\u2032ii (zi ) = yi + \u03b7(yi ), \u03b7(yi ) \u2208 F \u2032 , i \u2208 [1n].\n\nSince zi = \u03a6(ei1 )y1 , i \u2208 [1n], are elements of Y\u03b5 -matrix (\u03b5 is the identical substitution from Sn ) of automorphism \u03a6 in the base Y , by Lemma 3.6, there exists an\nendomorphism \u03b1 \u2208 End F such that\n\u03b1(zi ) = e\u2032ii (zi ) = yi + \u03b7(yi ).\n\n(5.4)\n\nSince x21 = 0 is the identity in \u0398, we have \u03b7(yi ) = 0. By Lemma 3.6, there exists\nan endomorphism \u03b1 \u2208 End F such that\n\u03b1(zi ) = e\u2032ii (zi ) = yi .\n\nSince F is a Hopfian algebra, the elements zi , i \u2208 [1n], form a base of F .\n(\u03c3)\n2. Let \u0398 be a subvariety of variety Nm . We shall show that there exists mij 6= 0\n(\u03c3)\n\nfor some i, j and \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . Assume that mij = 0 for all i, j and all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . We have\n(\u03c3)\n\n\u03a6(e11 )x\u03c3(1) = g11 (x1 , ..., xn ),\n(\u03c3)\n\n(\u03c3)\n\nwhere g11 \u2208 F \u2032 . Now we will prove, as an intermediate result, that g11 = 0 for all\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\n\u03c3 \u2208 Sn . Let g11 6= 0 for some \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . Thus, 1 < deg g11 \u2264 m \u2212 1. However, from\nthe equality\n\u03a6(e11 )x\u03c3(1) = \u03a6(em\n11 )x\u03c3(1)\n(\u03c3)\n\n(\u03c3)\n\nfollows deg g11 > m. This contradiction leads to g11 = 0.\n(\u03c3)\n(\u03c3)\nFinally, \u03a6(e11 )x\u03c3(1) = m11 + g11 = 0 for all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn and, as a consequence,\n\u03a6(e11 ) = 0, i.e., e11 = 0. Thus, we arrive at a contradiction again. Therefore, there\n(\u03c3)\nexists mij 6= 0 for some i, j and \u03c3 \u2208 Sn .\nAs in the case 1 we obtain the equality (5.4). From (5.4) follows\n\u03b1(zi ) = yi (mod F \u2032 ), for all i \u2208 [1n].\n\nIt is well known (see [7, 18]) that every endomorphism \u03c4 of a finitely generated\nnilpotent algebra G which induces an invertible linear transformation on the free\nK-module G/G\u2032 is an automorphism of G. Taking this into account we obtain\nthat \u03b1 is an automorphism of F . Thus, we have \u03b1\u22121 (yi ) = zi (mod F \u2032 ), i.e., the\nelements zi , i \u2208 [1n] form a basis of K-module F/F \u2032 . Since F is a finitely generated\nnilpotent algebra, the elements zi , i \u2208 [1n], form a base of F (see [18]).\nNow in the both cases, \u0398 \u2286 B2 or \u0398 \u2286 Nm , we have\n\u03a6(eij )zm = \u03a6(eij )\u03a6(em1 )y1 = \u03a6(eij em1 )y1 = \u03a6(\u03b4jm ei1 )y1 = \u03b4jm zi .\n\nBy Proposition 3.2, the automorphism \u03a6 is quasi-inner as claimed.\n\n\u0003\n\nNow we consider the variety \u03a5 of linear algebras with zero multiplication over a\nDedekind domain such that the group Aut End F , where F is a free two-generated\nalgebra over K, contains a non-quasi-inner automorphism. This example is a modification of an example by Isaacs [12].\n\n\fTHE SEMIGROUP OF ENDOMORPHISMS OF FREE ALGEBRAS OF VARIETIES\n\n11\n\n\u221a\nExample 5.4. Let K = {a + b \u22125 | a, b \u2208 Z} be a Dedekind domain and \u03a5 be\na variety of linear algebras over K with zero multiplication. Let V = K 2 be a free\nmodule over K. The module V can be considered as a free two-generated algebra\nover K of variety \u03a5. Note that a semigroup End V is the full matrix semigroup\nM2\u00d72 (K). We wish to construct an automorphism of the semigroup M2\u00d72 (K)\nwhich is not quasi-inner.\nLet\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1 + \u22125\n\u22122\n\u221a\n,\nm=\n\u22122\n1 \u2212 \u22125\nso that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\n2\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u22125\nm\u22121 =\n.\n2\n1 + \u22125\n2\n\nNote that m\u22121 \u2208\n/ M2\u00d72 (K) but m\u22121 xm \u2208 M2\u00d72 (K), i.e., \u03a6(x) = m\u22121 xm, x \u2208\nM2\u00d72 (K) is an automorphism of the semigroup M2\u00d72 (K). We will show that this\nautomorphism is not quasi-inner.\nAssume that \u03a6 is a quasi-inner automorphism of End F , i.e., there exists a\nbijection s : V \u2192 V on V such that \u03a6(x) = s\u22121 xs, x \u2208 M2\u00d72 (K). Consequently,\ns\u22121 xs = m\u22121 xm for all x \u2208 M2\u00d72 (K). Then \u03c3x = x\u03c3 for all x \u2208 M2\u00d72 (K), where\n\u03c3 = ms\u22121 is a mapping from V to V . Next we will prove that \u03c3 = \u03b1I, \u03b1 \u2208 K.\nConsider the linear transformation \u03b3a : V \u2192 V defined by \u03b3a (e1 ) = a, \u03b3a (e2 ) =\n0, where e1 = (1, 0), e2 = (0, 1) is a basis of the module V and a \u2208 V . Let \u03c3(e1 ) =\n\u03b1e1 + \u03b2e2 , \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 K. Since \u03c3\u03b3a (e1 ) = \u03b3a \u03c3(e1 ), we have \u03c3(a) = \u03b3a (\u03b1e1 + \u03b2e2 ) = \u03b1a,\ni.e., \u03c3 = \u03b1I, \u03b1 \u2208 K.\nNow we have ms\u22121 = \u03c3 = \u03b1I and thus s\u22121 = \u03b1m\u22121 . Since s\u22121 is the bijection\non V , we obtain that det \u03b1m\u22121 is a unit in K. However, only \u00b11\n\u221a are units in K.\nTherefore det \u03b1m\u22121 = \u00b11, and from this, 12 \u03b12 = \u00b11, i.e., \u03b1 = \u00b1 \u00b12. Since \u03b1 6\u2208 K\nwe arrived at a contradiction, i.e., \u03a6 is not quasi-inner.\nNote that we have also \u03a62 (x) = m\u22122 xm2 = a\u22121 xa, where\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u221a\n\u22125\n\u22122\n\u221a\n\u2208 M2\u00d72 (K)\na=\n\u22122 \u2212 \u22125\nSince det a = 1, the matrix a\u22121 belongs to M2\u00d72 (K) as well. Therefore, \u03a62 is a\nquasi-inner automorphism of End F , whereas \u03a6 is not.\nThis example counts in favour of the following problem:\nProblem 5.5. Let \u0398 be a variety of linear algebras over a domain K such that\n\u0398 \u2286 B2 or \u0398 \u2286 Nc for some c. Let \u03a6 be an automorphism of the semigroup\nEnd F , where F = F (x1 , ..., xn ) is a free n-generated algebra in \u0398. It is true that\nthere exists a natural number k(n) such that \u03a6k(n) is a quasi-inner automorphism\nof End F ?\nThe example 5.4 leads also to the following statement:\nCorollary 5.6. There exists a Dedekind domain which is not an R1 MF-domain.\nProof. Let the assumptions of \u221athe example 5.4 be fulfilled. Suppose that the\nDedekind domain K = {a + b \u22125 | a, b \u2208 Z} is an R1 MF-domain. Since the\nvariety \u03a5 belongs to B2 , by Proposition 5.3 all automorphisms of End F , where F\nis a finitely generated free algebra of \u03a5, are quasi-inner. This fact contradicts to\nthe example 5.4.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\nRemark 5.7. Note that Corollary 5.6\n\u221a can be also proved by direct calculations.\nIndeed, assume that K = {a + b \u22125 | a, b \u2208 Z} is an R1 MF-domain. Take the\nmatrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n2\u221a\n1 + \u22125\nc=\n\u2208 M2\u00d72 (K).\n3\n1 \u2212 \u22125\nSince rank c = 1, we can represent the matrix c as a column-by-row product:\n\u0012\n\n1+\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22125\n2\u221a\nx1 + y1 \u221a\u22125\n=\n*\n3\n1 \u2212 \u22125\nx2 + y2 \u22125\n\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\nx3 + y3 \u22125 x4 + y4 \u22125 ,\n\nwhere xi , yi \u2208 Z, i = [1, 4]. It can be shown that this system of polynomial\nequations of the second order has no solutions over Z. We omit the calculations.\nThis contradiction gives us a different proof of Corollary 5.6.\n6. Derivative algebras associated with a quasi-inner automorphisms\nLet \u03a6 \u2208 AutEnd F, F \u2208 \u0398, be a quasi-inner automorphism of the semigroup\nEnd F with the adjoint bijection s : F \u2192 F . Our goal is to describe these bijections\nof F . For this purpose we reformulate universal algebra notations and results from\n[27] for the category of linear algebras.\nBy Remark 3.4, the bijection s transforms every base X = {x1 , ..., xn } of F\ninto a base Y = {y1 , ..., yn } of this algebra: s(xi ) = yi , \u2200i \u2208 [1n]. Consider an\nautomorphism \u03c3 : F \u2192 F such that \u03c3(xi ) = yi , \u2200i \u2208 [1n]. Denote by s1 = \u03c3s\u22121\na bijection of F . We have s1 (xi ) = xi , \u2200i \u2208 [1n]. Define two automorphisms of\nEnd F :\n\u22121\n\u03a61 (\u03bd) = s1 \u03bds\u22121\n, \u2200\u03bd \u2208 End F.\n1 and \u03a62 (\u03bd) = \u03c3\u03bd\u03c3\n\nThen \u03a6 = \u03a6\u22121\n1 \u03a62 . Therefore, it is sufficient to investigate quasi-inner automorphisms of End F adjoint bijections of which preserve bases of F . It can be assumed that the adjoint bijection s of \u03a6 fixes the base elements xi \u2208 X, i.e.,\ns(xi ) = xi , \u2200i \u2208 [1n].\nDenote by \u03b8a1 ,...,an , ai \u2208 F , an endomorphism of F given on generators X by\nthe following rules:\n\u03b8a1 ,...,an (x1 ) = a1 , ..., \u03b8a1 ,...,an (xn ) = an .\nThen\n\u03a6(\u03b8a1 ,...,an ) = \u03b8s(a1 ),...,s(an) .\n\n(6.1)\nFrom (6.1) follows that\n(6.2)\n\u2217\n\nsF (xi1 , ..., xik ) = F (xi1 , ..., xik ), xis \u2208 X.\n\nDenote by F = hF ; \u25e6, \u22a5, \u2217, 0i a derivative algebra with the same support F as the\noriginal algebra and with one nullary operation 0 which coincides with 0 of F , one\nunary operation \u25e6 and two binary operations, \u22a5 and \u2217, determined in the following\nway:\n1. \u03b1 \u25e6 a1 = \u03b8a1 s(\u03b1 * x1 ), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 K, \u2200a1 \u2208 F and x1 \u2208 X,\n2. a1 \u22a5a2 = \u03b8a1 ,a2 s(x1 + x2 ), \u2200a1 , a2 \u2208 F and x1 , x2 \u2208 X,\n3. a1 \u2217 a2 = \u03b8a1 ,a2 s(x1 * x2 ), \u2200a1 , a2 \u2208 F and x1 , x2 \u2208 X,\nwhere the operations written on the right side of these formulas are the main\noperations in F . We shall say that the derivative algebra F \u2217 is associated with the\nautomorphism \u03a6.\n\n\fTHE SEMIGROUP OF ENDOMORPHISMS OF FREE ALGEBRAS OF VARIETIES\n\n13\n\nNow, for completeness of presentation, we give the proof of the following statement.\nProposition 6.1. [27] The following hold.\n1. Algebra F \u2217 \u2208 \u0398;\n2. The bijection s is an isomorphism of F into F \u2217 .\nProof. We will check the compatibility of the bijection s with operation \u2217. We have\n\u03a6(\u03b8a1 ,a2 )s(x1 * x2 ) = s\u03b8a1 ,a2 s\u22121 s(x1 * x2 ) = s\u03b8a1 ,a2 (x1 * x2 ) = s(a1 * a2 )\n\nOn the other hand by (6.1)\n\u03a6(\u03b8a1 ,a2 )s(x1 * x2 ) = \u03b8s(a1 ),s(a2 ) s(x1 * x2 ) = s(a1 ) \u2217 s(a2 ),\ni.e., s(a1 * a2 ) = s(a1 ) \u2217 s(a2 ). In a similar way it is easy to check the compatibility\nof s with operations \u22a5 and \u25e6. Finally, since s is a bijection on F , we have F \u2217 \u2208 \u0398\nand s : F \u2192 F \u2217 is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\nNow using these results we investigate the structure of bijections s adjoint to\nquasi-inner automorphisms \u03a6 of End F for some classes of homogeneous varieties\nof linear algebras.\nLet \u0398 be a homogeneous variety of linear algebras with or without 1 over a ring K\nsuch that for each its free algebra F (X) the following condition holds: there exists\na free associative algebra U (F ) (an enveloping algebra) containing the algebra F\nand freely generated by the same set X. We will denote by \" * \" an operation of\nmultiplication of elements from U (F ) (for brevity, we will omit this sign if it is clear\nfrom context). Note that the variety of Lie algebras, the variety generated by the\nfree special Jordan algebras and, of course, variety of associative algebras over a\nring K are such varieties [1, 7, 26]. We shall call these varieties A-varieties of linear\nalgebras.\nLet \u03a8 be a homogeneous variety of m-nilpotent linear algebras over a ring K\nsuch that for each its free algebra F freely generated by X there exists a nilpotent\nassociative algebra Um (F ) containing the algebra F and freely generated by the\nsame set X. We shall call these varieties Am -varieties of linear algebras. It is\nknown [5] that the variety Nm of m-nilpotent Lie algebras is an Am -variety.\nLet A(X) be a free associative algebra freely generated by X over a ring K. Take\nX\nf=\naI xI ,\nwhere xI = xi1 ...xim , xis \u2208 X, are monomials in A and aI \u2208 K are almost all 0.\nNote that the empty product of xi \u2208 X to represent 1. By the support of f we\nunderstand the set of all xI such that aI 6= 0.\nLet A = A(x1 , x2 , x3 ) be a 3-generated associative algebra over a ring K and\nf (x1 , x2 ) be a monomial in A. Denote by Mf the support of f (x1 + x3 , x2 ) in A.\nNow we need the following\nLemma 6.2. If f (x1 , x2 ) and g(x1 , x2 ) be two different monomials in A, then\n\\\nMf\nMg = \u2205.\n\nProof.

Let r be the minimal natural number\nsuch that k1r 6= k2r . We consider separately even and odd natural numbers r.\nIf r = 2k + 1, k \u2265 0, our statement follows from the fact that all monomials in\npolynomials (x1 + x3 )k1,2k+1 and (x1 + x3 )k2,2k+1 are different.

It is clear\nP that any distributive polynomial contains no constant term. Write\nP (x1 , x2 ) = i \u03b1i fi (x1 , x2 ), where \u03b1i \u2208 K and fi (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 Un are different monomials in Un .

Then the monomial\nk\n\nx1 x3 x3 . . . x3 xk2i2 . . . x1 x3 x3 . . . x3 x2i,2m . . . xk2is\n| {z }\n| {z }\nki1 \u22121\n\nki,2m\u22121 \u221216=0\n\nappears in (6.4 (a)) on the left but does not on the right. This gives a contradiction.\nIf there exists ki,2m > 1, m \u2265 1, in (6.5), then using the equality (6.4 (b)) we\nachieve a contradiction in a similar way. Therefore, every kir , r \u2208 [1s], is equal to\n0 or 1.\nAssume that ki1 = 1. Then arguing as above, we obtain ki,2k+1 = 0 for all k \u2265 1.\nIf all ki,2k = 0, k \u2265 1, then fi = x1 and we arrive at a contradiction with (6.4 (b)).\nThus, without loss of generality, it can be assumed that ki2 = 1.

Finally, we have our assertion.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to prove\nProposition 6.6. Let \u0398 be an A-variety of algebras over a ring K and \u03a6 \u2208\nAutEnd F be a quasi-inner automorphism of a semigroup End F . Let F \u2217 be the\nderivative algebras associated with \u03a6. Then there exist \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 K, \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 6= 0,\nsuch that the following statements hold\n(i) a \u2217 b = \u03b1a * b + \u03b2b * a;\n(ii) a\u22a5b = a + b;\n(iii) \u03be \u25e6 a = \u03c6(\u03be)a,\nfor any a, b \u2208 F \u2217 and \u03be \u2208 K and an automorphism \u03c6 : K \u2192 K.\nProof. We begin by showing (i). Let s be a bijection adjoint to \u03a6. Since sF (x1 , x2 ) =\nF (x1 , x2 ) (see the equality (6.2)), s(x1 x2 ) is a polynomial P (x1 , x2 ) which belongs\nto F (x1 , x2 ). By definition of the operation \u2217 in F \u2217 we have\na \u2217 b = \u03b8a,b s(x1 * x2 ) = \u03b8a,b P (x1 , x2 ) = P (a, b)\n\nSince \u2217 is a distributive operation in F \u2217 , the polynomial P (x1 , x2 ) is distributive.\nBy Lemma 6.5\nP (x1 , x2 ) = \u03b1x1 x2 + \u03b2x2 x1 , \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 K.\nIf \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0, the derivative algebra F \u2217 is an algebra where the multiplication is\ntrivial. Since F \u2217 \u2208 \u0398 and \u0398 is an A-variety, we achieve a contradiction and the\nresult follows.\n(ii) By definition of operation \u22a5, we have\n(6.6)\n\nx1 \u22a5x2 = s(x1 + x2 ) = G(x1 , x2 ),\n\nwhere G(x1 , x2 ) \u2208 F (x1 , x2 ). Thus, x1 = s(x1 ) = s(x1 + 0) = G(x1 , 0) and, similarly, x2 = G(0, x2 ). Now we write G(x1 , x2 ) as an element of U2 = U (F (x1 , x2 ))\n(6.7)\n\nG(x1 , x2 ) = x1 + x2 + \u03b3g(x1 , x2 ),\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 K, g(x1 , x2 ) \u2208 F (x1 , x2 ) \u2286 U2 and the degree of g(x1 , x2 ) in U2 is equal\nto k \u2265 2. We will show that, in fact, \u03b3 = 0.\nAssume, on the contrary, that \u03b3 6= 0. Consider the equality\n(6.8)\n\nx1 \u2217 (x2 \u22a5x3 ) = (x1 \u2217 x2 )\u22a5(x1 \u2217 x3 ).\n\nUsing (6.7) and the part (i) of our proposition, we obtain\n(6.9)\n\nx1 \u2217 (x2 \u22a5x3 ) = \u03b1x1 ((x2 \u22a5x3 )) + \u03b2((x2 \u22a5x3 ))x1 = \u03b1x1 x2 +\n\u03b1x1 x3 + \u03b2x2 x1 + \u03b2x3 x1 + \u03b1\u03b3x1 g(x2 , x3 ) + \u03b2\u03b3g(x2 , x3 )x1 .\n\nOn the other hand, we get\n(6.10)\n\n(x1 \u2217 x2 )\u22a5(x1 \u2217 x3 ) = (\u03b1x1 x2 + \u03b2x2 x1 )\u22a5(\u03b1x1 x3 + \u03b2x3 x1 ) = \u03b1x1 x2 +\n\u03b1x1 x3 + \u03b2x2 x1 + \u03b2x3 x1 + \u03b3g(\u03b1x1 x2 + \u03b2x2 x1 , \u03b1x1 x3 + \u03b2x3 x1 ).\n\nComparing the degrees in the expressions (6.9) and (6.10) we obtain\n(6.11)\n\ndeg (\u03b1\u03b3x1 g(x2 , x3 ) + \u03b2\u03b3g(x2 , x3 )x1 ) = k + 1\n\nand\n(6.12)\n\ndeg \u03b3 * g(\u03b1x1 x2 + \u03b2x2 x1 , \u03b1x1 x3 + \u03b2x3 x1 ) > k + 1.\n\n\f16\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\nThis contradiction shows that \u03b3 = 0 and (ii) follows.\n(iii) By definition of operation \u25e6 in F \u2217 , we have\n\u03b1 \u25e6 x1 = s(\u03b1x1 ), \u03b1 \u2208 K, x1 \u2208 X\n\n(6.13)\n\nSince, according to (6.2), sF (x1 ) = F (x1 ), and so\n\u03b1 \u25e6 x1 = P\u03b1 (x1 ),\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhere P\u03b1 (x1 ) \u2208 F (x1 ). Consider the equality\n\u03b1 \u25e6 (x1 + x2 ) = \u03b1 \u25e6 x1 + \u03b1 \u25e6 x2 .\n\n(6.15)\nBy (6.13) we get\n\n\u03b1 \u25e6 (x1 + x2 ) = \u03b8x1 +x2 s(\u03b1x1 ) = \u03b8x1 +x2 P\u03b1 (x1 ) = P\u03b1 (x1 + x2 ).\nFrom (6.15) follows\n(6.16)\n\nP\u03b1 (x1 + x2 ) = P\u03b1 (x1 ) + P\u03b1 (x2 ).\nP\nWrite P\u03b1 (x1 ) as an element of U1 = U (F (x1 )): P\u03b1 (x1 ) = i \u03b1i xk1i , \u03b1i \u2208 K, ki > 0.\nBy (6.16) we get\nX\nX\nX\n\u03b1i xk2i\n\u03b1i xk1i +\n\u03b1i (x1 + x2 )ki =\n(6.17)\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nSince U (F (x1 , x2 )) is a graded algebra, (x1 + x2 )ki = xk1i + xk2i for every ki . Hence\nall ki = 1. Thus, P\u03b1 (x1 ) = s(\u03b1x1 ) = \u03b11 x1 for some \u03b11 \u2208 K. Denote \u03c6(\u03b1) = \u03b11 ,\nwhere \u03c6 : K \u2192 K is a mapping of K into K. Since s : F (x1 ) \u2192 F (x1 ) is a\nbijection on F (x1 ), the mapping \u03c6 is a bijection on K. From \u03be \u25e6 (\u03bc \u25e6 x1 ) = (\u03be\u03bc) \u25e6 x1\nand (\u03be + \u03bc) \u25e6 x1 = \u03be \u25e6 x1 + \u03bc \u25e6 x1 , \u03be, \u03bc \u2208 K, follows P\u03be\u03bc (x1 ) = P\u03be P\u03bc (x1 ) and\nP\u03be+\u03bc (x1 ) = P\u03be (x1 ) + P\u03bc (x1 ). Thus \u03c6 is an automorphism of K as required. This\nends the proof.\n\u0003\nNow we consider a similar assertion for Am -varieties of algebras.\nProposition 6.7. Let \u03a8 be an Am -variety of algebras over a ring K, Fm be a\nfinitely generated free algebra of \u03a8, \u03a6 be a quasi-inner automorphism of a semi\u2217\ngroup End Fm and Fm\nbe the derivative algebra associated with \u03a6. The following\nstatements hold:\n(a) If |K| = \u221e or |K| = pk , k \u2265 1, where pk \u2224 m \u2212 1 and m 6= 2, then the\n\u2217\n.\nconclusions (i), (ii), (iii) of Proposition 6.6 are fulfilled for Fm\nk\nk\n(b) If |K| = p , k \u2265 1, where p |m\u22121, then the conclusions (i), (iii) of Proposition\n\u2217\n6.6 are fulfilled for Fm\nbut instead (ii) the following is true\n\u2032\n\u2217\n(ii) For any a, b \u2208 Fm\nwe have a\u22a5b = a + b + \u03b3g(a, b), \u03b3 \u2208 K, such that if \u03b3 6= 0\nthen g(x1 , x2 ) is a nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree m \u2212 1 in\nU (Fm ) satisfied the following system of functional equations:\n(6.18)\n\ng(x1 , x2 ) + g(x1 + x2 , x3 ) = g(x2 , x3 ) + g(x1 , x2 + x3 )\ng(x1 , \u2212x1 ) = 0,\n\nwhere xi \u2208 X, i \u2208 [13].\n(c) If K any domain and m = 2, then the conclusion (ii) and (iii) of Proposition\n6.6 are fulfilled for F2\u2217 but instead (i) holds: a \u2217 b = 0 for any a, b \u2208 F2 .\n\n\fTHE SEMIGROUP OF ENDOMORPHISMS OF FREE ALGEBRAS OF VARIETIES\n\n17\n\nProof. We consider the natural embedding Fm \u2286 U (Fm ), where U (Fm ) is the\nassociative free m-nilpotent algebra. Recall that U (Fm ) is isomorphic to A(X)/I,\nwhere A(X) is a free associative algebra generated by X = {x1 , ..., xn } and I is an\nideal generated as a verbal ideal by elements x1 * ... * xm . It is easy to check that\nLemmas 6.2 and 6.5 remain valid for the algebras F and U (Fm ). In the proofs of\nthese Lemmas, it is sufficient to restrict our consideration to m-reduced polynomials\nin the algebra U (Fm ).\nLet assumptions of the part (a) be fulfilled. In the same manner as in Proposition\n6.6 we derive the same conclusions (i), (iii) from this Proposition. Let us prove the\n\u2217\nequality (ii): a\u22a5b = a + b, a, b \u2208 Fm\n. We will use the notations from Proposition\n\u2217\n6.6 and the operation \u22a5 as defined in (6.6). We have in Fm\n(\u03b1 \u25e6 x1 )\u22a5(\u03b1 \u25e6 x2 ) = \u03b1 \u25e6 (x1 \u22a5x2 ), \u03b1 \u2208 K, x1 , x2 \u2208 X.\nSince the part (iii) from Proposition 6.6 is fulfilled in our case, we get\n(6.19)\n\n(\u03c6(\u03b1) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b1)m\u22121 )g(x1 , x2 ) = 0\n\nThus the conditions of part (a), |K| = \u221e or |K| = pk , k \u2265 1, where pk \u2224 m \u2212 1, give\nus g(x1 , x2 ) = 0. This proves (ii) and therefore, the part (a) of our Proposition.\nLet assumptions of the part (b) be fulfilled. Again the conclusions (i), (iii) hold\nin this case and it is remains to check the conclusion (ii)\u2032 . Since |K| = pk , k \u2265 1,\nwhere pk | m \u2212 1, it is possible that g(x1 , x2 ) 6= 0. Let us analyze the proof of the\npart (ii) of Proposition 6.6 in this case. There we have obtained a contradiction\ncomparing the degrees of polynomials in both parts of the equalities (6.10) and\n(6.9). As is easy to see there is no contradiction if and only if in these equalities\neither the polynomial g(x1 , x2 ) is homogeneous of degree m \u2212 1 or g(x1 , x2 ) = 0.\nLet g(x1 , x2 ) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree m \u2212 1. Since\n(6.20)\n\n(x1 \u22a5x2 )\u22a5x3 = x1 \u22a5(x2 \u22a5x3 )\n\nwe have\nG(G(x1 x2 ), x3 ) = G(x1 , G(x2 , x3 ));\nG(x1 + x2 + \u03b3g(x1 , x2 ), x3 ) = G(x1 , x2 + x3 + \u03b3g(x1 , x2 ));\n\u03b3g(x1 , x2 ) + \u03b3g(x1 + x2 + \u03b3g(x1 , x2 ), x3 ) = \u03b3g(x2 , x3 ) + \u03b3g(x1 , x2 + x3 + \u03b3g(x2 , x3 )).\nSince g(x1 , x2 ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree m \u2212 1, we get\n(6.21)\n\ng(x1 , x2 ) + g(x1 + x2 , x3 ) = g(x2 , x3 ) + g(x1 , x2 + x3 )\n\nSince x1 \u22a5x2 = x2 \u22a5x1 , we have g(x1 , x2 ) = g(x2 , x1 ), i.e., the polynomial g(x1 , x2 )\nis symmetric. Now, let s be the bijection adjoint to \u03a6. Since s(0) = 0, we have\nx1 \u22a5(\u2212x1 ) = 0, i.e., g(x1 , \u2212x1 ) = 0. This proves the part (b) of our assertion.\nFinally, let m = 2, i.e. F = F2 be an algebra with trivial multiplication. Since\nF2 \u2243 F2\u2217 , we have a \u2217 b = 0, a, b \u2208 F2\u2217 . From g(x1 , x2 ) = 0 follows a\u22a5b = a + b.\nAnalogously, we may check that \u03be \u25e6 a = \u03c6(\u03be)a for any a \u2208 F2\u2217 , \u03be \u2208 K and an\nautomorphism \u03c6 : K \u2192 K. This ends the proof.\n\u0003\nNow we will describe the case where the system of the functional equations (6.18)\nhas a non-trivial solution.\nLemma 6.8. The system (6.18) has a non-trivial solution in the class of homogeneous symmetric polynomials from U (Fm ) of degree m \u2212 1 over a ring K iff\n\n\f18\n\nR.

In these two cases the polynomial\ng(x1 , x2 ) = (x1 + x2 )m\u22121 \u2212 xm\u22121\n\u2212 xm\u22121\n1\n2\n\n(6.22)\n\nis a non-zero particular solution of the system (6.18).\nProof. Let g = g(x1 , x2 ) be a solution of the system (6.18). Setting x2 = \u2212x3 in\nthe first equation of (6.18) and taking into account the symmetry of polynomial\ng(x1 , x2 ), we obtain\ng(x1 , x2 ) = \u2212g(x1 + x2 , \u2212x1 )\n\n(6.23)\n\nConsider a linear operator S on the algebra U (Fm ):\nwhere \u039b =\n\n\u0012\n\nS(f )(x1 , x2 ) = \u2212f (\u039b(x1 , x2 )), \u2200f \u2208 U (Fm )),\n\u0013\n1 1\n. By (6.23), S(g) = g. Since \u039b3 = \u2212I, we have\n0 \u22121\ng(x1 , x2 ) = S 3 (g)(x1 , x2 ) = \u2212g(\u2212x1 , \u2212x2 ).\n\nThus, g(x1 , x2 ) = (\u22121)m g(x1 , x2 ). Therefore, if m = 2k + 1, k \u2265 0 and char K 6=\n2, we obtain g(x1 , x2 ) = 0. Otherwise, a straightforward check shows that the\npolynomial (6.22) is a non-trivial solution of the system (6.18).\n\u0003\n7. Proofs of the main theorems\nProof of Theorem A. Let \u03a6 \u2208 Aut End F (X) be an automorphism of End F .\nBy Proposition 5.3, \u03a6 is a quasi-inner automorphism of End F . Let s : F \u2192 F\nbe the bijection adjoint to an automorphism \u03a6 and F \u2217 be the derivative algebra\nassociated with \u03a6. Recall that under our assumptions s(xi ) = xi for all xi \u2208 X.\nDenote by [ , ]1 and [ , ]2 the Lie operations in the Lie algebras F and F \u2217 , respectively, i.e.,\nF = hF ; *, +, [ , ]1 , 0i and F \u2217 = hF ; \u25e6, \u22a5, [ , ]2 , 0i\n\nBy PBW Theorem the variety of Lie algebras is an A-variety [1, 7].

Since F \u2217 is a free Lie\nalgebra, \u03b1 6= 0. By virtue of Proposition 6.1,\n(7.1)\n\ns[a, b]1 = [s(a), s(b)]2 = \u03b1[s(a), s(b)]1 , \u2200a, b \u2208 F\n\nIn the same way we obtain\n(7.2)\n\n\u2200a, b \u2208 F, \u2200\u03be \u2208 K\ns(a + b) = s(a)\u22a5s(b) = s(a) + s(b), s(\u03bea) = \u03be \u25e6 s(a) = \u03c6(\u03be)s(a).\n\nLet \u03be\u03b1 : F \u2192 F be a bijection on F defined by \u03be\u03b1 (a) = \u03b1a for any a \u2208 F .

Using\nthe same arguments as in [24] and Theorem A one can prove that the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n1. The algebras H1 and H2 are categorically equivalent.\n2. The algebras H1\u03c3 and H2 are geometrically equivalent for some \u03c3 \u2208 Aut K.\nHere the algebras H1\u03c3 and H2 coincide as rings and multiplication by a scalar in\n\u03c3\nH1 is defined by the rule:\n\u03bb \u25e6 a = \u03bb\u03c3\n\n\u22121\n\n* a, \u2200\u03bb \u2208 K, \u2200a \u2208 H1\u03c3 .\n\nEarlier, for the variety of Lie algebras over infinite fields this result was obtained\nin [24].\nProof of Theorem B. 1. Let us prove the part 1 of Theorem B. Since \u03a6 is\nan automorphism of End Fm , by Proposition 5.3, \u03a6 is quasi-inner. As above, we\n\u2217\nmay consider a derivative algebra Fm\n= hFm ; \u2217, \u25e6, \u22a5, 0i associated with \u03a6. By\n\u2217\nProposition 6.7, we have in Fm\n\u2203\u03b1, \u2203\u03b2 \u2208 K, \u2200a, b \u2208 Fm , a \u2217 b = \u03b1a * b + \u03b2b * a,\n\n(7.3)\n\nSince m > 2, we have \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 6= 0. Taking into account the law of associativity in\nFm : (a \u2217 b) \u2217 c = a \u2217 (b \u2217 c), we arrive at \u03b1\u03b2 = 0. Since K is a domain, \u03b1 = 0 or\n\u03b2 = 0. Since \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 6= 0, we have a \u2217 b = \u03b1a * b, \u03b1 6= 0, or a \u2217 b = \u03b2b * a, \u03b2 6= 0.\nBy Proposition 6.1, the adjoint bijection s to \u03a6 is an isomorphism of Fm into\n\u2217\n. Since |K| = pk , k \u2265 1, p 6= 2, and pk |m \u2212 1, by Proposition 6.7, part (b), we\nFm\nhave for the bijection s : Fm \u2192 Fm the following equalities:\n(7.4)\n\n\u2203\u03b3 \u2208 K, \u2203\u03b1 6= 0 \u2208 K, \u2203\u03c6 \u2208 Aut K, \u2200\u03be \u2208 K, \u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm ,\ns(a + b) = s(a)\u22a5s(b) = s(a) + s(b) + \u03b3g(s(a), s(b)),\ns(\u03bea) = \u03be \u25e6 s(a) = \u03c6(\u03be)s(a), s(a * b) = s(a) \u2217 s(b) = \u03b1s(a) * s(b),\n(or \u2203\u03b2 6= 0 \u2208 K, \u2200a, b \u2208 Fm , s(a * b) = s(a) \u2217 s(b) = \u03b2s(b) * s(a)),\n\nsuch that if \u03b3 6= 0 then g(x1 , x2 ) is a nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial\nof degree m \u2212 1 in U (Fm ) which satisfies the system (6.18).\nLet m 6= 2k, k \u2265 1, and char K 6= 2. By Lemma 6.8, we get g(x1 , x2 ) = 0. If\n\u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b2 = 0 in (7.4), we obtain, as above in Theorem A, that the automorphism\n\u03a6 is semi-inner. If \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 6= 0, the automorphism \u03a6 is a composition of mirror\nand semi-inner automorphisms. Therefore, the group Aut End F is generated by\nsemi-inner and mirror automorphisms.\nLet m = 2k, k \u2265 1, or char K = 2. By Lemma 6.8, there exists a non-zero\nhomogeneous symmetric polynomial g = g(x1 , x2 ) of degree m \u2212 1 in U (Fm ) which\nis a solution of (6.18). Now we take g = g(x1 , x2 ) and set\n(7.5)\nin (7.4). Since\n\n\u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm , \u2203\u03b1 6= 0 \u2208 K, s(a * b) = \u03b1s(a) * s(b)\ns(a + b) = s(a) + s(b) + \u03b3g(s(a), s(b)),\n\nwe obtain\nsr (a + b) = sr (a) + sr (b) + r\u03b3g(sr (a), sr (b)), r \u2265 1.\nFrom the last equality follows\n(7.6)\n\nsp (a + b) = sp (a) + sp (b),\n\nwhereas\nsp\u22121 (a + b) 6= sp\u22121 (a) + sp\u22121 (b).\n\n\f20\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\nWe obtain, as in Theorem A, that \u03a6p is a semi-inner automorphism, whereas \u03a6p\u22121\nis not. Hence, the automorphism \u03a6 is p-semi-inner. Setting in (7.4)\n\u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm , \u2203\u03b2 6= 0 \u2208 K, s(a * b) = \u03b2s(b) * s(a),\nand choosing \u03c6 the identical automorphism of K, in the same way as above we\ncome to a p-mirror automorphism of End Fm .\nNow we have to prove the existence of p-semi-inner and p-mirror automorphisms\nof End Fm . To this end we define a mapping \u03c4 : Fm \u2192 Fm such that\n\u2203\u03c6 \u2208 Aut K, \u2200\u03be \u2208 K, \u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm , \u2200xi \u2208 X,\n\u03c4 (0) = 0, \u03c4 (xi ) = xi , \u03c4 (xki11 ...xkirr ) = xki11 ...xkirr ,\n\u03c4 (\u03bea) = \u03c6(\u03be)\u03c4 (a), \u03c4 (a + b) = \u03c4 (a) + \u03c4 (b) + g(\u03c4 (a), \u03c4 (b)),\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhere the polynomial g = g(x1 , x2 ) is a non-zero homogeneous symmetric polynomials of degree m \u2212 1 in U (Fm ) which is a solution of (6.18). Since\ng(a, b) + g(a + b, c) = g(b, c) + g(a, b + c), \u2200a\u2200b\u2200c \u2208 Fm ,\nwe obtain\n\u03c4 ((a + b) + c) = \u03c4 (a + (b + c)).\nHence, the mapping \u03c4 is defined correctly. As above (see (7.6)), we obtain\n(7.8)\n\n\u03c4 p (a + b) = \u03c4 p (a) + \u03c4 p (b),\n\nwhereas\n\u03c4 p\u22121 (a + b) 6= \u03c4 p\u22121 (a) + \u03c4 p\u22121 (b).\n\nFrom (7.8) and the condition \u03c4 (xi ) = xi , \u2208 [1n] follows \u03c4 p = IdFm , where IdFm is\nthe identical mapping on Fm . Therefore, \u03c4 is a bijection on Fm . Thus, there exists\na bijection \u03c4 \u22121 : Fm \u2192 Fm and, furthermore, it is easy to check that\n(7.9)\n\n\u03c4 \u22121 (a + b) = \u03c4 \u22121 (a) + \u03c4 \u22121 (b) + (p \u2212 1)g(\u03c4 \u22121 (a), \u03c4 \u22121 (b)), \u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm\n\nDefine a mapping \u03a8 of End Fm such that \u03a8(\u03bd) = \u03c4 \u22121 \u03bd\u03c4, \u2200\u03bd \u2208 End Fm . Using\n(7.9), we obtain that \u03a8 is an automorphism of End Fm . Now it is clear that \u03a8p is\na semi-inner automorphism, whereas \u03a8p\u22121 is not. Hence, the automorphism \u03a8 is\np-semi-inner.\nSetting\n\u03c4 (xki11 ...xkirr ) = xkirr ...xki11 , xik \u2208 X\n\nin the definition (7.7) and choosing \u03c6 the identical automorphism of K, we come\nto a p-mirror automorphism of End Fm .\nNow it is clear that the group Aut End Fm is generated by semi-inner, mirror,\np-semi-inner and p-mirror automorphisms. This proves the part 1 of Theorem B.\n2. Let us prove the part (2) of Theorem B. Since |K| = \u221e or |K| = pk , k \u2265 1,\nwhere pk \u2224 m \u2212 1, by Proposition 6.7, part (a), we have the following equalities for\nthe bijection s : Fm \u2192 Fm :\n\u2203\u03b1 6= 0 \u2208 K, \u2203\u03c6 \u2208 Aut K, \u2200\u03be \u2208 K, \u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm\ns(a + b) = s(a) + s(b), s(\u03bea) = \u03c6(\u03be)s(a), s(a \u2217 b) = \u03b1s(a) * s(b),\n(or \u2203\u03b2 6= 0 \u2208 K, \u2200a, b \u2208 Fm , s(a * b) = s(a) \u2217 s(b) = \u03b2s(b) * s(a)).\n\nIn the same manner as above we can prove that every automorphism \u03a6 of the semigroup End Fm is either a semi-inner or a mirror automorphism, or a composition\nof them. This proves the part 2 of Theorem B.\n\n\fTHE SEMIGROUP OF ENDOMORPHISMS OF FREE ALGEBRAS OF VARIETIES\n\n21\n\n3. In the case of the variety N2 , the multiplication in algebra F2 is trivial, i.e.,\na * b = 0. Thus, we have the following equalities for the bijection s : F2 \u2192 F2 :\n\u2203\u03c6 \u2208 Aut K, \u2200\u03be \u2208 K, \u2200a\u2200b \u2208 Fm\ns(a + b) = s(a) + s(b), s(\u03bea) = \u03c6(\u03be)s(a).\nAs above we obtain that all automorphisms of End F2 are semi-inner. The proof is\ncomplete.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem C. Let \u03c6 \u2208 Aut L\u25e6 . It is clear that \u03c6 is an equinumerous automorphism. By Proposition 2.8, \u03c6 can be represented as the composition of a stable\nautomorphism \u03c6S and an inner automorphism \u03c6I . Since a stable automorphism\ndoes not change free algebras from \u03980 , we obtain that \u03c6S \u2208 Aut End F (x1 , ..., xn ),\nwhere F = F (x1 , ..., xn ) is a finitely generated free Lie algebra of L. By Theorem\nA, \u03c6S is a semi-inner automorphism of End F (x1 , ..., xn ). Using this fact and Reduction Theorem [15, 21] we obtain that the composition \u03c6 = \u03c6S \u03c6I is a semi-inner\nautomorphism of \u03980 . This ends the proof.\n\u0003\nNow we provide an example of the variety N3 of 3-nilpotent associative algebras over the field F2 with a free algebra F3 = F3 (x1 , ..., xn ) such that the group\nAutEnd F3 contains 2-inner and 2-mirror automorphisms.\nExample 7.2. Consider the polynomial g(x1 , x2 ) = x1 x2 + x2 x1 in F3 . The polynomial g(x1 , x2 ) is a solution of the system (6.18) in the class of homogeneous\nsymmetric polynomials from F3 of degree 2 (see also Lemma 6.8). In a similar way\nas in proof of Theorem B we can construct a bijection s : F \u2192 F with the help of\nthe polynomial g(x1 , x2 ) so that\n(7.10)\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 K, \u2200a, b \u2208 Fm , \u2200xi \u2208 X,\ns(0) = 0, s(xi ) = xi , s(xki11 ...xkirr ) = xki11 ...xkirr ,\ns(a + b) = s(a) + s(b) + g(s(a), s(b)) = s(a) + s(b) + s(a)s(b) + s(b)s(a).\nAs in Theorem B, we can prove correctness of definition of the mapping s. It is\nclear that s2 is an automorphism of F3 , whereas s is not. Thus, the automorphism\n\u03a6 of the semigroup End F3 , such that \u03a6(\u03bd) = s\u03bds\u22121 for any \u03bd \u2208 End F3 , is 2-inner.\nSetting in (7.10)\ns(xki11 ...xkirr ) = xkirr ...xki11 , xik \u2208 X,\nwe arrive at a 2-mirror automorphism of End F3 .\n\n8. Quasi-inner automorphisms of the semigroup End A(X)\nLet A = A(x1 , ..., xn ) be a free associative algebra over a ring K. A description\nof Aut End A(x1 , x2 ), where A(x1 , x2 ) is a free two generated associative algebra\nover an infinite field, has been obtained in [4]. In this connection the following\nassertion presents interest\nProposition 8.1. Let \u03a6 \u2208 Aut End A be a quasi-inner automorphism of End A,\nwhere A = A(x1 , ..., xn ), n \u2265 2, be a free finitely associative algebra over a domain\nK. Then \u03a6 is either a semi-inner or a mirror automorphism, or a composition of\nthem.\n\n\f22\n\nR. LIPYANSKI\n\nProof. Let s : A \u2192 A be the adjoint bijection to \u03a6. By Proposition 6.6 we have for\ns the following equalities\n\u2203\u03b1 6= 0 \u2208 K, \u2203\u03c6 \u2208 Aut K, \u2200\u03be \u2208 K, \u2200a\u2200b \u2208 A\ns(a + b) = s(a) + s(b), s(\u03bea) = \u03c6(\u03be)s(a), s(a \u2217 b) = \u03b1s(a) * s(b),\n(or \u2203\u03b2 6= 0 \u2208 K, \u2200a, b \u2208 A, s(a * b) = s(a) \u2217 s(b) = \u03b2s(b) * s(a)).\n\nIn the same manner as in Theorem B, part 2, we can prove that \u03a6 is either a\nsemi-inner or a mirror automorphism, or a composition of them.\n\u0003\n9.
