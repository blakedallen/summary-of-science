They enable us to access several\ntypes of information more easily than in the past. Simultaneously, the density of mobile users is\nrapidly increasing. When hundreds of mobile phones emit radiation, their total power is found to\nbe comparable to that of a microwave oven or a satellite broadcasting station. Thus, the question\narises: what is the public exposure level in an area with many sources of electromagnetic wave\nemission? We show that this level can reach the reference level for general public exposure (ICNIRP\nGuideline) in daily life. This is caused by the fundamental properties of electromagnetic field,\nnamely, reflection and additivity. The level of exposure is found to be much higher than that\nestimated by the conventional framework of analysis that assumes that the level rapidly decreases\nwith the inverse square distance between the source and the affected person. A simple formula for\nthe exposure level is derived by applying energetics to the electromagnetic field. The formula reveals\na potential risk of intensive exposure.\n\nKEYWORDS: exposure, public health, mobile phones, electromagnetism, energetics\nJapan is a country where many people use mobile communicators frequently almost anywhere including in public\ntransport, where access is enabled even in underground trains by base stations placed in tunnels, although their use\nis prohibited in hospitals and airplanes to prevent possible fatal accidents. On one occasion the author experienced\ninterference from a mobile phone in the headset of a music player, and later found that serious interference also\noccurred in some hearing aids; such interference occurs even if there is a distance of more than five meters between\nthe source and an affected person. The incidents were not consistent with a well-known paradigm for interference\nby mobile phones that emphasizes that the interference occurs only if the affected person is sufficiently close to the\nsource. Based on this paradigm, several guidelines have been constructed, one of which recommends, \"people should\nnot use mobile phones within 22 centimeters of a person with a cardiac pacemaker.\" [1] This short-range interference\nparadigm has been widely accepted as a guidelines in several places and, to our knowledge, it is the only indication\nto citizens of the possibility of intensive exposure. Extensive studies are also in progress to clarify the effects on\nthe health of mobile users themselves, who are the nearest to the mobiles [2\u20134]. Here, we do not discuss this aspect\nbecause the users use the mobiles at their own risk. Rather, we focus on the issue of public exposure to emission from\nanonymous users, because an affected person cannot control or avoid exposure even when a health condition exists.\nIn this sense, the latter is a more serious problem than the former.\nThe lack of recognition of the possibility of high levels of exposure could be attributed to the lack of a simple\ntheory describing exposure caused by a distributed emission of electromagnetic waves in a reflective boundary; the\nconventional estimation of exposure is based only on the short-range interaction paradigm and is not sufficient to\nfind the level of exposure caused by distributed emissions. Conventional analysis is valid as long as there is only one\nmobile phone and also the boundary is not reflective. These conditions are not appropriate for considering current\nsituations. Thus, we will derive a simple and generic formula for electromagnetic field and demonstrate the possibility\nof high levels of exposure in certain situations. Although we initiated this analysis as a result of being motivated by\nan incident in a public train, the following formula is applicable to more general situations. The physical quantity\nthat we will estimate is the average equivalent poynting vector P (W/m2 ) which represents the energy flux, and it is\nused to describe the level of exposure. We work within the framework of classical electromagnetism [5]. Comparison\nof the result is made with international guidelines for exposure limits, for which extensive studies on possible problems\nhave been performed [6].\nConsider a closed box (system) with a reflective surface boundary, in which sources of electromagnetic waves are\nspatially distributed. Some parts of the boundary may be nonreflective or open. We assume for simplicity that waves\ncoming from different sources are incoherent. Conservation of energy in the electromagnetic field leads directly to the\nbalance equation for the electromagnetic energy, U , accumulated in the system,\nd\nU + JE = Wr ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere JE and Wr are an outward energy flux at the boundary and the sum of emission powers in the system,\nrespectively. Our concern is only the average energy density that corresponds to the equivalent poynting vector,\n1\n\n\fbecause the deviation from the average value should be small in the case of a high reflection probability at the\nboundary. Thus, according to the conventional method of statistical physics, we hereafter ignore the details of the\ngeometry of the system and introduce the characteristic length of the system L\u2217 that is a mean free path between\nsuccessive reflections at the boundary, where the electromagnetic wave is assumed to behave as a ray which propagates\nfreely. The characteristic time, t\u2217 , is also defined through L\u2217 and the velocity of the light, c, as t\u2217 = L\u2217 /c, that is,\nthe mean free time between reflections. If there were no reflection at the boundary, all of the energy in the system\nwould diffuse through the boundary in time t\u2217 . Hence, we have the relation,\nt \u2217 * JE = U .\n\n(2)\n\nThe effect of reflection is incorporated in the right-hand side of eq. (1) as an additional emission term. The power\nintroduced into the system by the reflection is a product of the flux JE and the average reflection probability [7], R.\nWith eqs. (1) and (2), we reach the balance equation including the effect of reflection:\ncU\ncU\nd\nU + \u2217 = Wr + \u2217 R .\ndt\nL\nL\n\n(3)\n\nAs a stationary solution, which is realized for a timescale longer than t\u2217 /kd , we have\nU=\n\nL\u2217 Wr\n,\nc kd\n\n(4)\n\nwhere kd is the average dissipation probability at the boundary defined as kd \u2261 1 \u2212 R; its value lies between 0 and 1.\nSumming up the possible multiple reflection terms gives the same stationary result. The average equivalent poynting\nvector, hP i, is therefore obtained through the relation hP i = uc = VU c, where u is the energy density and V is the\nvolume of the system, as\nhP i =\n\nL\u2217 Wr\n.\nV kd\n\n(5)\n\nThis is the main result of the study. This simple formula predicts the average strength of the electromagnetic field\nin the system. We note that the analytical expression of eq. (5) itself was derived in a generic situation. The reader\nmay apply it to several specific systems; for example, buses, elevators, prefabricated houses, concert halls and so on.\nThe differences between the situations may be accounted for by changes in the parameters. We also note that the\nformula may be directly derived by dimensional analysis for the system characterized by four parameters: the mean\nfree path L\u2217 , the total emission power Wr , the system volume V , and the average dissipation probability kd . If we\nintroduce the average emission power per mobile, wr , the total emission power, Wr , is written as Wr = N wr , where\nN is the number of sources (mobiles).\n\n\u2217\n\nFIG. 1. Average exposure level hP i is shown as a function of the average dissipation probability, kd : hP i = LV kWr , where L\u2217 ,\nd\nV , kd , and Wr are the characteristic length of the system, the volume, the average dissipation probability, and the total power\nof emissions in the system, respectively.\n\u221a The\u221acurves represent three different powers of total emission, Wr = 5, 20, and 100\nwatts, where V = 112 (m3 ), and L\u2217 = 3 V = 3 112 (m) is assumed. The horizontal dotted line indicates the reference level for\ngeneral public exposure (1 GHz) set by ICNIRP. The reader may observe that the exposure level has dependence on several\nparameters. By scaling, one can obtain the dependence on other parameters.\n\n2\n\n\fFrom this result, we learn that the exposure level rapidly rises as the dissipation probability, kd , decreases to zero,\nwhich would be the case if all boundaries were made of a metal with a reflection probability near unity; an example\nmay be an elevator without windows. This mechanism of small dissipation in metal is already utilized in waveguides\nfor transporting microwave with minimum loss. On the contrary, the conventional estimation corresponds to the case\nthat kd = 1 in eq. (5), where the exposure level is minimum. The level of exposure hP i increases in proportion to\nthe total emitted power Wr , which in turn increases in proportion to the number of mobiles N ; this mass (additive)\neffect has scarcely been discussed in the literature [2].\nAlthough the formula is applicable to various situations, an order estimation for a specific example is useful for\ndemonstrating how to apply the formula to a concrete system, and this result is never negligible in certain situations.\nWe emphasize that our aim is not to find an individual value of exposure in a specialized situation, but to point out\nthe significance of the phenomenon. Readers may perform individual calculations using the formula (eq. (5)) with a\nspecial set of parameters. In order to perform the order estimation, we require the characteristic values, L\u2217 , Wr , V\nand kd . Here we confine ourselves to the typical values for a commuter train car in Japan. We use the values for a\ncar in a series 3000 train of Tokyu Corporation, one\u221aof the\u221amost recently introduced commuter trains in metropolitan\nareas of Japan, for which V = 112 (m3 ), and L\u2217 \u223c 3 V = 3 112(m) [8]. Since the bodies of modern trains are made of\nmetals, the reflection probability inside the body may be approximated as unity because the dissipation at the point\nof reflection is negligible compared to other types of dissipation, for example, through windows [9]. Because waves\nare assumed to disappear irreversibly through the window, the dissipation probability, kd , may be estimated in the\nfirst approximation from the ratio of the area of the windows to the gross surface area of the car. In our case (Tokyu\nseries 3000) it is estimated as kd = 0.10 [11]. The total emission power also depends significantly on the situation.\nFor greater generality, we demonstrate exposure levels at three different values, Wr = 5, 20, 100 watts, with the\nreference level for general public exposure of 1 GHz given by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation\nProtection (ICNIRP) [6]. The exposure level increases as the dissipation probability decreases. If we decrease the\npower, Wr , the critical value of the dissipation probability decreases. In the case of a large power, Wr = 100, the\naverage exposure level is of the order of the reference level solely because of the mass (additive) effect of the waves\n(even without the effect of reflection). Since we have not yet introduced any special parameters except for the volume\nof the system, one can use this graph (Fig.1) to predict exposure levels of other systems (not only trains) of similar\nvolume.\nTo clarify how the emission power, Wr , corresponds to the situation on the train, we illustrate it with a specific\nexample. In a commuter train, passenger capacities are as follows: designed passenger capacity (100% jyosharitsu)\nis 151 persons, and the seating capacity is 54 or 51 persons [11]. Since the proportion of existing passengers to the\ndesigned passenger capacity (jyosharitsu) can exceed 200% under the most crowded condition, a car can hold more\nthan 300 persons. Thus, the case Wr = 100 watts corresponds, for example, to the situation in which each of 300\nmobiles emits a power of 0.33 watts; the case Wr = 20 watts corresponds to the situation in which 50 mobiles emit\na power of 0.4 watts each, and so on. As the average dissipation probability in the Tokyu series 3000 is kd = 0.10,\nthe critical total power according to the ICNIRP reference level is Wr = 12 watts. Note that a mobile communicator\nemits power to some degree as long as it is switched on [12]. For more detailed consideration, here we note two\nuncertainty factors: i) the presence of passengers which is assumed to increase the average dissipation probability; ii)\nthe shielding effect of windows, of which the characteristic length is comparable to or less than the wavelength (0.3\nm at 1 GHz). The former decreases the level of exposure, while the latter increases it.\nOn the basis of this observation, we conclude that in spite of several uncertainty factors there is the non-negligible\npossibility that the simultaneous use of a number of mobiles in an area with a reflective boundary creates a level\nof exposure which can exceed that stipulated in the ICNIRP guidelines. Let us consider a commuter train that\nunexpectedly stops between stations due to an incident (typical for morning trains in metropolitan areas of Japan).\nWhat will passengers with mobile phones, who find themselves to be late for work, do? Once a closed area is filled with\nelectromagnetic waves to a considerable level, the effect of their interference on people with electromedical instruments\ncould be serious, because they have no way to avoid the emissions [13].\nIn this paper, we have analyzed how the exposure level increases depending on the situation, by reflection and\nadditivity of electromagnetic waves. We analytically derived a generic formula with which one can predict the possible\nexposure level. For an example of a realistic situation, we applied the formula to a commuter train and performed\nan order estimation of the possible exposure level. It was shown that the simultaneous use of a number of mobile\ncommunicators in a closed area may result in a considerable level of exposure, as high as that determined by the\nICNIRP to be the limit for public safety [6]. These results are easy to understand: Consider a dark room with a single\nlight with low power, where all of the boundaries, walls, ceiling and floor, are black. If we cover the black boundaries\nwith mirrors, it significantly increases the brightness without incurring any additional cost for power for lighting. Also,\nif we increase the number of lights, the brightness will increase throughout the room. The mechanism of the increase\n3\n\n\fof intensity is completely the same for this light and the electromagnetic waves of the present case, because both\nare governed by the same fundamental properties of electromagnetism, namely, reflectivity and additivity. Therefore,\nthe emergence of the intensive field is not surprising. Increasing public exposure to electromagnetic wave emission\nis a form of environmental pollution; in both cases, naive personal consumption will lead to global pollution, which\neventually may hurt humans. Since the increase of electromagnetic field by reflective boundaries and the additivity of\nsources has not been recognized yet, further detailed studies on various situations and the development of appropriate\nregulations are required.\nWe acknowledge Mr. Tamaoki at Tokyu Corporation for providing us with detailed data on their commuter trains,\nEast Japan Railway Company for providing a plan of their commuter trains, C.

Assume that the surface is made of a material which is fully reflective,\nexcept for windows through which the wave dissipates. Assume that the ratio of the area of the windows to the total\nsurface is 10%. Then, the average reflection probability, R, is approximated as 0.9. Thus, the average dissipation probability\nkd = 1 \u2212 R = 0.1.\n[8] Tokyu Corporation (private communication).\n[9] The reflection probability, in principle, depends strongly on the conditions. However, in the microwave frequency region,\nit is known that the reflection probability may be treated as almost unity in comparison with other dissipation processes:\nLet us consider the reflection probability of the electromagnetic wave propagating perpendicular to the surface of the\nreflective boundary. The reflection probability,\np r, can be estimated using the formula applicable to the wave with length\nlonger than that of visible light, r = 1 \u2212 2 2\u01eb0 \u03c9/\u03c3, where \u01eb0 , \u03c9, and \u03c3 are the dielectric constant of vacuum, the angular\nfrequency of an electromagnetic wave and the electric conductivity, respectively [5]. By using an experimental value for\nthe electric conductivity [10], we obtain the reflection probability. For aluminum, it is 0.9999. Since it is known that the\nvalues of electric conductivity for most metals lie in the order of approximately 107 (\u03a9\u22121 m\u22121 ), the reflection probability\nis estimated as approximately 0.9998. This shows that the dissipation of the wave upon reflection is negligible compared\nto other dissipation processes in the present case.\n[10] National Astronomical Observatory (ed.): Rika Nenpyo (Chronological Scientific Tables) (Maruzen Co., Ltd., Tokyo, 1999)\n[in Japanese].\n[11] In a conventional car designed only for passengers, which has no room for a driver or a conductor, the sum of all window\nareas is 21. 1 (m2 ), and the total surface area is 201.1 (m2 ). The ratio of the two values gives the average dissipation\nprobability, kd = 0.10 (courtesy of Mr. Tamaoki of Tokyo Corporation). In the case of a car of series 201 of JR-East, which\nis used for rapid commuter trains on the Chuo Line (Chuo-Kaisoku) in Tokyo, the value is estimated to be approximately\nthe same, kd = 0.10, where the calculation was performed according to the plan of the car presented by the East Japan\nRailway Company. A regulation on the use of mobile phones in trains was introduced by Tokyu Corporation in October\n2000.\n[12] The output of a mobile communicator may depend on the intensity of the wave from a base station. As shown by the ratio\nof the window area to the total body surface of the car which corresponds to the average dissipation probability, the cabin\n\n4\n\n\fof a train is largely shielded electromagnetically. Thus, the wave from the base station is considerably weakened inside the\ncar. It is known that the weaker the intensity of the wave that reaches the mobile phone from the base station, the more\npower the mobile phone emits. We also note that the maximum output power of a mobile phone is 0.6 watts for analog\nphones, and 0.8 watts for digital phones (burst value) in Japan [1]. In the report by W.H.O., the maximum output power\nis stated to range from 0.2 watts to 0.6 watts [4].\n[13] Experiments on animals with cardiac disease who are helped by a pacemaker will directly prove the risk of a intensive\nexposure. One report [1] suggests that the interference can be fatal even below the reference level set in the ICNIRP\nguidelines for the general public.\n\n5\n\n\f"}
