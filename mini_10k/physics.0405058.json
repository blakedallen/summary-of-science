QED calculations enter into a number of\nfundamental values related to free particles and simple\natoms. In conventional atomic systems the accuracy of\nQED tests is restricted by insufficient knowledge of the\nnuclear structure which is the main obstacle on the way\nto improve theoretical predictions for the Lamb shift and\nthe hyperfine structure in hydrogen (see e.g. [1, 2]).\nThe leading corrections for different energy levels coming from nuclear size effects are proportional to the\nsquared value of non-relativistic wave function of the electron at the origin:\n\u2206Enucl = AN * |\u03c8(r = 0)|2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the value of the coefficient AN is determined\nby parameters of the nucleus and does not depend on\natomic quantum numbers. For s\u2013levels in hydrogenlike systems the non-relativistic wave function at the\norigin scales with the principal quantum number n as\n|\u03c8(r = 0)|2 \u223c 1/n3 . Thus, if one takes the following\ndifference of the energies E(nS) corresponding to two\ndifferent s\u2013levels n\u20323 E(n\u2032 S) \u2212 n3 E(nS), the leading contribution of nuclear effects cancels.\nRecently, a significant progress in calculations of the\n8EHFS (2S)\u2212 EHFS (1S) difference of 2S and 1S hyperfine\nsplitting (HFS) intervals in light hydrogen-like atoms has\nbeen achieved [3]. New state-dependent QED terms to\nthe HFS interval frequency fHFS (nS) up to the fractional\norder of \u03b14 and \u03b13 me /mp have been calculated as well\nas the next-to-leading nuclear structure effects.

The study of neutral atoms and ions requires different experimental techniques. While 1S HFS intervals in neutral atoms [4, 8]\nhave been measured with a higher relative accuracy as in\nthe helium-3 ion [10], the 2S HFS intervals in hydrogen\n[6, 7] and deuterium [9] are known less precisely as in the\nhelium-3 ion [11]. Since the traditional microwave methods have likely reached their limits we have been working\non an optical determination of the hyperfine interval in\nthe metastable 2S state of hydrogen and deuterium.\n\nRecently we have measured the hyperfine splitting of\nthe 2S state of the hydrogen atom applying an optical\ntechnique [7]. It is based on two-photon spectroscopy on\na cold beam shielded from magnetic fields. The 2S HFS\ninterval has been determined from the frequency difference of two stable light fields exciting 1S\u20132S transitions\nfor singlet (F = 0) and triplet (F = 1) components. The\ndifferential method cancels a number of systematic effects intrinsic to two-photon spectroscopy which provides\na significant increase of accuracy in comparison with absolute frequency measurements [12, 13, 14].\n\nWe have improved this technique [7] and applied it\nto the spectroscopy of atomic deuterium. The hyperfine\nstructure in deuterium is approximately 4 times smaller\nthan in hydrogen and its accurate optical measurement is\na harder problem, however, a smaller HFS value has also\nsome advantages due to a reduction of certain systematic effects for the comparison of the 1S\u20132S frequencies\nbetween different spin states. The experiment and its\nsystematic effects are presented in two following sections\nwhile a comparison of theory and experiment is summarized in the concluding part of the paper.\n\n\f2\nto the vacuum chamber\n\nL a - detector\nHP5071A\n\ncompensation\nfield\n\ncryostat\n\nHV\n\nx2\n\nD\n\nsynthesizer\n\nV\n\nAOM\n\n243 nm\n\nfiber\nintensity\nstabilization\n\nULE\ncavity\n\nlock\n\ndetector quench\nfield\n\ndye laser\n486 nm\n\nchopper\n\u03bc-metal\n\nFIG. 1: Laser system for 1S\u20132S deuterium spectroscopy.\n\nII.\n\nMEASUREMENT OF THE 2S HYPERFINE\nSPLITTING\n\nThe 2S HFS interval has been measured once by Reich,\nHeberle, and Kusch [9]. The value of\n(D)\n\nfHFS (2S) = 40 924 439(20) Hz\n\n(2)\n\nhas been obtained by a radio-frequency (rf) method applied earlier to a similar measurement in hydrogen [5]. In\ncomparison to the hydrogen measurement [5], the abso(D)\nlute accuracy of determination of fHFS (2S) [9] has been\nimproved by a factor of 3. In spite of the fact that\nthe HFS intervals in deuterium are strongly affected by\nmagnetic fields, as in hydrogen, the average of two rf\ntransitions frequencies in the metastable deuterium atom\n(F = 1/2, mF = \u22121/2) \u2194 (F = 3/2, mF = 1/2) and\n(F = 1/2, mF = 1/2) \u2194 (F = 3/2, mF = \u22121/2) contains no linear field-dependent terms and thus is rather\ninsensitive to the field. Still, the most important systematic effects contributing to the 20 Hz error were the\nuncertainty in the determination of the magnetic field\nand the rf Stark effect.\n(D)\nFor an independent measurement of fHFS (2S) we use\nthe hydrogen spectrometer setup described elsewhere\n[15]. A dye laser operating near 486 nm is locked to\na definite TEM00 mode of an ultra-stable cavity with\nUltra-Low Expansion (ULE) glass spacer and a drift less\nthan 0.5 Hz/s (Fig.1). To change the laser frequency with\nrespect to the cavity mode we use a broadband doublepass acousto-optic modulator (AOM) placed between the\nlaser and the cavity. The frequency of the dye laser is\ndoubled in a Barium \u03b2-borate crystal, and the resulting 243 nm radiation is coupled to a linear enhancement\ncavity inside the vacuum chamber where the two-photon\nexcitation takes place.\nAtomic deuterium produced in a 15 W, 2.5 GHz rf\ngas discharge flows through teflon tubes to a copper nozzle cooled by a flow-through cryostat (Fig.2). Atoms\nthermalize with the nozzle walls and leave the nozzle in\nboth directions coaxially with the enhancement cavity\nmode. A part of the atoms flying along the mode are excited to the 2S state and then reach the detection zone\nwhere a weak electrical quenching field is applied. The\n\n\u03bc-metal\n\nUHV\n\nFIG. 2: Vacuum part of the experiment. HV and UHV are\nthe high- and ultrahigh vacuum regions, while V is the bypass\nvalve reducing the atomic flow escaping from the nozzle.\n\nfield mixes the 2S and 2P states of the atoms causing\ntheir fast decay to the ground state with the emission of\nLyman\u2013\u03b1 photons. Photons are counted by a solar-blind\nphotomultiplier connected to a photon counter incorporated into time-of-flight measurement scheme. The excitation radiation is periodically blocked before the cavity by a chopper wheel, and 121 nm photons are detected only within a 3 ms dark time interval. Introducing a delay \u03c4 between closing the beam and starting the\ndetection, we can thus select different velocity groups\ncontributing to the signal. The delay \u03c4 sets an upper\nlimit for the atomic velocity to vmax = l/\u03c4 , where l is\nthe distance between the nozzle and detector. Using a\nmulti-channel scaler we sort the counts in adjacent time\nbins (\u03c4 = 10 \u03bcs, 210 \u03bcs, 410 \u03bcs, . . .,) and simultaneously\nrecord up to 12 spectra containing the information about\nvelocity-dependent effects, e.g. 2nd order Doppler effect.\nHere we will point out some important changes which\nhave been introduced in the spectrometer configuration\n(which has been used for the recent measurements in\natomic hydrogen [7, 14]) to optimize it for the current\ndeuterium measurement. To maximize the count rate for\nslow atoms (v \u223c 200 m/s) one has to find a compromise\nbetween thermalization and recombination processes at\nthe cold walls of the nozzle by adjusting the nozzle geometry and temperature. The best rates are observed with\na larger nozzle diameter (2\u20132.5 mm compared to 1.2 mm\nfor hydrogen) and at slightly higher temperatures (6\u20136.5\nK compared to 5 K). Typically, the count rate with the\ndeuterium beam has been higher than for hydrogen (by\na factor 2\u20135 depending on \u03c4 ).\nOn the way between the gas discharge and the nozzle\nwe have installed a bypass valve which can be opened to\na high-vacuum (HV) part of the vacuum chamber, where\nthe cavity mirrors, the nozzle and the detector have been\nplaced. By opening the valve we reduce the atomic flow\nthrough the nozzle by a factor of 4. Even at the lowest\npressure in the gas discharge (0.7 mbar) and with opened\nvalve, the count rate was sufficient to detect a solid 2S\nsignal for the atoms with v \u223c 200 m/s.

Without the atomic\nbeam, the background gas pressure in the UHV region\nequals 3 * 10\u22128 mbar. The background gas pressure increases with the deuterium flow escaping from the nozzle\nand can be thus varied up to 2 * 10\u22127 mbar.\nThe excitation region is shielded against external magnetic fields. As in [7], we use a two-stage \u03bc\u2013metal shielding. The outer shielding together with the compensation\nfield reduces residual fields over the entire interaction region to 10\u201320 mG. Configuration of the inner shielding\nhas been improved to increase the shielding factor as well\nas its throughput for pumping.\nIn the absence of magnetic fields, the 2S HFS interval\nfrequency is given by the following combination of optical\nfrequencies and the ground state HFS interval:\n(D)\n\n(D)\n\nfHFS (2S) = fHFS (1S) + fF =3/2 \u2212 fF =1/2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere fF =1/2 and fF =3/2 are the frequencies of the doublet and the quadruplet transitions at 121 nm (see Fig.3).\nIn our experiment, we measure the frequency difference\n(fF =3/2 \u2212 fF =1/2 ) using two-photon spectroscopy of the\ncorresponding transitions. The frequency of the groundstate splitting has been measured by Wineland and Ramsey [8] with an uncertainty of 5 * 10\u221212 :\n(D)\n\nfHFS (1S) = 327 384 352.5222(17) Hz.\n\n(4)\n\nThe contribution to the resulting error budget introduced\nby this uncertainty is negligible.\n\nFIG. 4: Simultaneous recording of the two transition lines\n(top). AOM frequencies fAOM corresponding to the centers\nof the doublet and quadruplet transition lines (bootom). The\nfrequency change is due to the drift of the reference ULE\ncavity (bottom).\n\nFor allowed two-photon transitions between the levels\nwith \u2206F = 0, the contribution of the linear Zeeman effect cancels and the HFS frequency shift in a magnetic\nfield B scales as B 2 /fHFS which is unfavorable for deuterium in comparison to hydrogen. But due to a low-field\nregime and the absence of linear terms, our measurement\nis rather insensitive to magnetic fields. In our case, the\n(D)\nmagnetic field B shifts the frequency fHFS (2S) approxi2\n2\nmately as 35 * B kHz/G .\nThe laser as well as the lock electronic are adjusted in\nsuch a way, that the two (1S, F = 1/2) \u2192 (2S, F = 1/2)\n(doublet) (1S, F = 3/2) \u2192 (2S, F = 3/2) (quadruplet)\ntransitions can be excited by changing the AOM frequency (see Fig.3).\nTo measure the frequency difference between the two\ntwo-photon transitions we have applied the following procedure. The frequency of the double-pass AOM placed\nbetween the reference ULE cavity and the laser is tuned\nto one of the transitions and one point of the spectrum is\nmeasured with a photon accumulation time of 0.5 s. After\nthe measurement, the AOM frequency fAOM is sweeped\nover a big fixed frequency interval (approximately equals\n(D)\n(D)\nto [fHFS (1S) \u2212 fHFS (2S)]/8 \u2248 36 MHz) to reach the\nother two-photon transition. During the sweep, the laser\nhas been continuously kept in lock. The factor 8 arises\nfrom the double-pass scheme for the AOM, the second\nharmonic generation stage and the two-photon process.\nThan we introduce 0.5 s pause as recovery time for mul-\n\n\f4\ntiple feedbacks, and repeat the measurement of one point\nof the other two-photon transition. After the measurement we add a small frequency step for scan and sweep\nthe synthesizer back to the first transition. The result of\nsuch a procedure is presented on Fig.4(top).\nThe rf synthesizer driving the AOM is continuously\nreferenced to the 10 MHz signal of a HP5071A cesium\nfrequency standard calibrated by GPS (Fig.1). The miscalibration of the primary standard introduces a negligible uncertainty to the measured difference. After the\ndouble-pass AOM, the laser light is spatially filtered by\nmeans of a single-mode fiber, while the intensity of the\nlight coupled into the cavity is actively stabilized. That\nguarantees that the coupling conditions which can change\nthe frequency of the reference cavity mode [16] are the\nsame for both transitions.\nBoth simultaneously recorded doublet and quadruplet\ntransition lines are fitted with a Lorentzian function in\nthe time and frequency domains. A typical time interval between the centers of such a line pair is less than\n5 s. This corresponds to some small correction on a\nlevel of a few hertz which should be introduced to correct for the reference cavity drift (fig.4(bottom)). Such\na procedure significantly reduces the influence of reference cavity frequency fluctuations on the 2S HFS data\nstatistics. The new method suppresses the influence coming from all drifts in the experimental setup with a time\nscale exceeding 200 s which is required to record one\nline. Even though such fluctuations do not introduce systematic shifts, a long time is required to average them.\nThe approach is much more forgiving to systematic effects: one independent point is obtained after 3 minutes\nof measurement, while for the previous method [7] the\ncorresponding time interval was about 20 minutes.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS\n(D)\n\nWe have measured fHFS (2S) during 7 days using the\nnew method and during 6 days applying the method described in [7]. To test for systematic effects we have\nvaried different parameters of the experiment within\neach day. We have recorded over 1000 deuterium timeresolved spectra. The averaged amplitude ratio between\nquadruplet and doublet transitions equals to 2.00(2)\nwhich is in a good agreement with theoretical expectation.\nThe systematic effects for our two-photon beam spectroscopy are well-known [13]. For the differential measurement, the most significant effects cancel out. As\nshown in [7], the differential dynamic Stark shift cancels to the level of 10\u22126 relative to the shift of the 1S\u20132S\ntransition (about 500 Hz). Because of some residual fluctuations of the 243 nm radiation intensity, the doublet\nand quadruplet lines acquire slightly different shifts. We\ncorrect for this difference for each line by monitoring the\npower leaking out of the cavity (Fig.2). The resulting\ncorrection for the new method equals 0.5 Hz which is a\n\nfactor 4 lower than for the measurement in hydrogen [7].\nFor the simultaneous recording technique, long-term intensity fluctuations in the enhancement cavity contribute\nless to the result than in the case of [7]. Besides the correction, we add a 0.5 Hz uncertainty to the error budget.\nA DC electrical field E mixes 2S and 2P levels causing a 2S level shift. According to [17], the energy shift of\nthe 2S level is reversely proportional to the Lamb shift.\nThus, the differential shift scales as EHFS /L2S\u22122P , where\nL2S\u22122P is the Lamb shift of the 2S level. The evaluated\nshift of the 2S HFS interval in deuterium equals \u2212300\nE 2 Hz cm2 /V2 and is about 4 times smaller as in hydrogen. The excitation region is shielded from stray fields\nby coating all surrounding parts of the interaction region\nwith graphite. Residual stray fields in the setup are estimated to be less than 30 mV/cm [18], which corresponds\nto a 2S HFS frequency shift on a level of \u22120.3 Hz. We\nadd an uncertainty of 0.5 Hz to the error budget considering the slightly worse geometrical properties of our\nshielding compared to the Faraday cage used in [18].\nResidual magnetic fields split the magnetic sublevels\nand shift the measured hyperfine splitting to higher\nvalues. The shift mostly originates from imperfectly\nshielded parts of the excitation region lying in the HV region (Fig.2). To check for this effect we have once made a\nset of measurements without compensation field and ob(D)\nserved a change of fHFS (2S) equal to 20(22) Hz. Without\ncompensation field, the measured value of magnetic fields\naround the nozzle and the detector is about 200 mG. The\ncompensation field reduces the magnetic fields for at least\na factor of 10, which means that the residual shift should\nbe on a sub-hertz level. We conservatively estimate the\nshift as 0.5(1.0) Hz.\nAnother source for level shifts is a pressure shift caused\nby collisions with the background gas and within the\nbeam itself. The ground-state hyperfine splitting in hydrogen and deuterium is rather insensitive to collisions.\nTypically, this shift is on a level of 1 Hz/mbar depending\non the buffer gas [19, 20] which corresponds to a vanishing shift for our pressure range. On the other side, there\nare no reliable experimental data for the pressure shift of\nthe 2S HFS frequency [6, 7]. The upper limit for the 2S\nHFS frequency shift can be taken as the frequency shift\nof the 1S (F = 1, mF = \u00b11) \u2194 2S (F \u2032 = 1, m\u2032F = \u00b11)\ntransition equal to \u22128(2) MHz/mbar [21, 22]. But considering the theoretical works [23, 24], there is no reason\nto expect the 2S HFS shift to be orders of magnitude\nhigher than for the ground state.\nWe have experimentally investigated the influence of\n(D)\ncollisions on the fHFS (2S) frequency. Most of the collisions take place within the atomic beam where the pressure can be much higher than the background gas pressure. Using the method of simultaneous detection, we\nhave varied the atomic flow over a wide range by changing the pressure in the gas discharge (between 0.8 mbar\nand 8 mbar) and by opening the bypass valve (Fig.2).\nThe background gas pressure scales linearly with the flow\nwith a small offset of 3 * 10\u22128 mbar.

One unit\ncorresponds to 3.6 * 1017 particles coming to the nozzle per\nsecond. The data is obtained using the simultaneous recording method and corresponds to the delay time of \u03c4 = 410 \u03bcs.\nTo extrapolate to the zero flow we fit the data with a linear\nfunction (solid line).\n\nare presented in Fig.5. Each point represents the result\nof statistical averaging of multiple data points detected\nat different days. About 1/4 of all the data have been\ntaken at the lowest pressure in the gas discharge with\nan opened valve (the left point). At high flows the slow\natoms are accelerated and pushed away from the beam\nby collisions (Zacharias effect) [18] which causes a loss\nin statistics and corresponding increase of uncertainty.\nMoreover, the measurement time becomes restricted by\na fast growth of a film of molecular deuterium on the\nnozzle. For the previous method [7] the flow range of {2 8} (Fig.5) is practically unreachable. Disregarding the\ndelay time \u03c4 we have not observed any indication for a\n2S HFS interval pressure shift on our level of accuracy.\nThe observed transition lines are shifted by the second order Doppler effect in a range between 0.1\u20131 kHz\ndepending on the velocity distribution of the atoms contributing to the signal [13]. The lines are not symmetric and significantly differ from Lorentzian profiles at\nshort (\u03c4 < 410\u03bcs) delays (Fig.6). If we excite twophoton transitions in the same thermal beam and detect the signal with some precisely defined delay time\n\nTABLE I: 2S HFS frequency and statistical uncertainty of\nextrapolation for different delays \u03c4 .

To estimate the possible uncertainty coming form\nthe \"wrong\" fitting procedure with a Lorentzian function\nand all other velocity-dependent effects, we have evalu(D)\nated the fHFS (2S) frequency for different delays. The\ndata for each delay has been corrected for the AC Stark\nshift, and then the extrapolation to zero flow has been\nmade (Fig.5). The results of this extrapolation are presented in the Table I. All velocity-dependent systematic\neffects, if they exist, should reveal themselves in such\nevaluation procedure.\nAll the results are consistent within the error bars. For\nhigher delays \u03c4 the corresponding uncertainty grows due\nto the lack of statistics. As a final value we have chosen\n(D)\nthe result fHFS (2S) = 40 924 453(5) Hz (\u03c4 = 410 \u03bcs) due\nto the following reasons: (i) the statistical uncertainty\nfor this result is small, (ii) the line-profile is practically\nundistinguishable from Lorentzian, and (iii) the fast nonthermalized atoms do not contribute to the signal. We\nadd an additional uncertainty of 0.3 Hz corresponding to\nthe conservatively estimated shift coming from the collisions with the residual background gas.\nThe data obtained during 6 days of measurement applying the older method presented in [7] give the result of\n(D)\nfHFS (2S) = 40 924 462(15) Hz. The data are measured\nonly at low deuterium flows {0.2\u20131.5} and are simply averaged over the entire ensemble. We have increased the\nuncertainty due to the possible pressure shift (1 Hz) and\nthe AC Stark shift (2 Hz).\nCombining both these statistically independent results\nand adding all known systematic uncertainties linearly,\nwe arrive at the final value for the 2S hyperfine interval\nin atomic deuterium\n(D)\n\nfHFS (2S) = 40 924 454(7) Hz.\n\n(5)\n\nThis result is in a good agreement with the one obtained\nby an rf method [9], but is more accurate by a factor 3.\n\n\f6\nTABLE II: Summary of systematic errors and the final result\nfor the 2S hyperfine interval.
