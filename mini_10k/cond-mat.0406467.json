It was originally introduced1 to study the\nthe superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition in liquid helium, and later argued to describe the physics of\nan array of coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs).2\nSuch proposal has been strikingly substantiated by a\nrecent breakthrough experiment,3 where the superfluidinsulator transition was observed in a 87 Rb BEC array.\nThis result greatly reinvigorated the studies on\nthe quantum phase transition characterizing the BH\nmodel.4,5,6,7,8 Indeed, the ongoing progress in condensate trapping techniques promises an unprecedented control on the parameters of the experimental realizations of\nsuch model. A simple example in this respect is supplied\nby the quite direct relation between the intensity of the\nlaser beam trapping the condensates at the sites of the\nso-called optical lattice and the tunneling interaction between neighbouring condensates, accounted by the hopping amplitude in the relevant BH Hamiltonian.2,3\nRecently, several proposals have been brought forward\nconcerning the realization of BEC arrays characterized\nby non-trivial layouts. Suitable laser setups, possibly\nwith different wavelengths, can be used to generate optical superlattices.9,10,11,12,13 Techniques borrowed from\nholography14 or from semiconductor technology15 have\nbeen proposed for the creation of optically or magnetically confined inhomogeneous BEC arrays.\nThe BH model is also commonly used to describe\nJosephson junction arrays16 (JJAs), which can be easily\narranged according to non-trivial layouts, including inhomogeneous ones.17,18 In this case the phase transition\ncan be observed measuring different samples or adjusting\nan external magnetic field applied to the same sample.16\nIn the light of this, the need arises for the study of a\n\nBH model characterized by a generic hopping term. A\nfurther point of interest in this respect is provided by\nthe unexpected features induced by topological inhomogeneities in the properties of discrete boson systems19\neven in the absence of boson interaction.20,21\nFor the study of the zero-temperature phase diagram of the BH model several techniques have been\nadopted. Qualitatively correct results are provided\nby numerical8,22 and analytical23,24,25 mean-field approaches. As it is well known, even for relatively small\nsystems the formidable size of the Hilbert space rules\nout the route of direct diagonalization in the study\nof the ground state properties of the BH Hamiltonian, determining the features of the zero-temperature\nphase diagram. In the case of homogeneous systems,\nclever numerical methods have been devised that provide quite satisfactory results. However, since they\nrely on features such as self-similarity26 or translational\ninvariance,27 their generalization to topologically inhomogeneous structures is at least problematic. Of course,\nthe superfluid-insulator transition on such structures\ncan be studied exploiting the flexibility of Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations, that provide the most general and reliable numerical approach. Indeed, this technique was successfully applied to the case of regular\nlattices28,29 , possibly in the presence of inhomogeneities\narising from random30,31,32,33 or harmonic4,5 local potentials. Recently, some results addressing inhomogeneous hopping have been reported.19 As to analytical\napproaches, the strong coupling perturbative results reported in Ref. 34 allow a quite satisfactory description of\nthe zero-temperature phase diagram of the BH model on\nregular bipartite lattices, possibly with disorder.\nHere, we extend the third-order perturbative results\nof Ref. 34 to a generic structure, possibly non-bipartite\nand/or topologically inhomogeneous. We remark that\ncommonly investigated regular lattices, such as the\n\n\f2\ntriangular12,35 or the Kagom\u00e813 lattice, are non-bipartite.\nWe show that in the general case two further significant\nthird-order contributions appear in the perturbative expansion of the ground state energy of the system, and of\nthe boundaries of the Mott lobes thereof. Furthermore\nwe show that terms arising from inhomogeneous hopping\namplitudes appear in the expansion of a physically interesting quantity such as the local density of bosons already\nat the first perturbative order. We also supply some examples where the new terms play a significant role.\nII.\n\nTHE BOSE-HUBBARD MODEL ON A\nGENERIC STRUCTURE\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the pure BH model on a generic\nstructure comprising M sites has the form\n\"\n#\nM\nM\nX\nX\nU\n+\nnj (nj \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03c4\naj tjh ah\n(1)\nH=\n2\nj=1\nh=1\n\nwhere aj (a+\nj ) is the boson annihilation (creation) operator at site j, nj = a+\nj aj is the relevant number operator, U > 0 is the boson repulsion strength and \u03c4 > 0\nis an overall scaling factor controlling the magnitude of\nthe possibly inhomogeneous hopping matrix, t. Since the\nlatter contains information about the connectivity of the\nunderlying structure, it is tjh = 0 \u21d4 Ajh = 0, where A is\nthe so-called adjacency matrix, whose generic entry Ajh\nequals one only if sites j and h are adjacent, and zero\notherwise. Hence topological inhomogeneity can come in\nthe form of a non-trivial connectivity,\ni.e. a site depenP\ndent coordination number zj = h Ajh , and/or in the\nform of uneven hopping amplitudes tij . We remark that\nthis applies also to periodic structures, such as the inhomogeneous Kagom\u00e8 lattice in Fig. 2 (C.) or the T3 lattice\nof Ref. 18. Note that Hamiltonian (1) commutes with the\nPM\ntotal number of bosons, N = j=1 nj . Hence the properties of its ground state |\u03c8i - i.e. the state minimizing\nh\u03c8|H \u2212 \u03bcN |\u03c8i, where \u03bc is the chemical potential controlling the boson population - can be conveniently studied\nconsidering one number eigenspace at a time.\nThe competition between the on-site repulsion and the\nkinetic energy - proportional to U and \u03c4 , respectively -\nproduces a well-known zero-temperature phase diagram\nin the \u03bc/U -\u03c4 /U plane, where a series of adjacent Mottinsulator lobes appears. Outside these lobes the cost of\nchanging the total number of particles in the system by a\nfinite amount vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Conversely, within the Mott lobes, adding or subtracting a\nsingle particle always costs a finite amount of energy, and\nthe total boson population is commensurate to the size\nof the structure, N = n0 M , where n0 \u2208 N. Hence, the\nleft and right boundary of the filling-n0 Mott lobe are\ncustomarily evaluated as the ground-state energy gaps\n\u03bcL (n0 , \u03c4 ) = EMott (n0 , \u03c4 ) \u2212 Ehole (n0 , \u03c4 )\n\u03bcR (n0 , \u03c4 ) = Epart (n0 , \u03c4 ) \u2212 EMott (n0 , \u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere EMott (n0 , \u03c4 ), Ehole (n0 , \u03c4 ) and Epart (n0 , \u03c4 ) are the\nground state energies of H when the total population is\nn0 M , n0 M \u2212 1 and n0 M + 1, respectively. Following\nRef. 34, in the sequel we term the latter two defect states\nand label \"def\" quantities relevant to either of them.\nIn Ref. 34 the quantities in Eqs. (2) are quite satisfactorily approximated by a third-order strong coupling\nperturbative expansion, the perturbative parameter being \u03c4 . Such results carry an explicit dependence on the\nhopping matrix t and, quite interestingly, on its maximal\neigenvalue and eigenvector. This means that the influence of topology, algebraically described by t, can be in\nprinciple singled out explicitly in the perturbative expansion of \u03bcL and \u03bcR . However, the perturbative results\nreported in Ref. 34 apply only to homogeneous bipartite\nP\nlattices, whose hopping matrix is such that M\nh=1 tjh = z\nand (t2p+1 )hh = 0. Actually, since such expansions are\nlimited to the third order, the latter constraint can be\nweakened, and only regular lattices featuring triangular\nloops have to be excluded, (t3 )hh = 0. In this respect we\nmention that third order results have been reported for\nthe particular case of the regular triangular lattice in the\npresence of a magnetic field.35\n\nIII.\n\nPERTURBATIVE RESULTS\n\nIn the following we provide the complete third-order\nstrong coupling perturbative expansions for the quantities in Eqs. (2), obtained including those terms arising\nfrom the presence of triangular loops and topological inhomogeneities in the discrete structure underlying the\nBH model. Such terms, pertaining to the third perturbative order, are denoted \"\u22b3\" and \"\u22ca\", respectively.

(3)-(9). As we mention\nabove, the ground state energies appearing in Eqs. (2)\nare obtained restricting the BH Hamiltonian to the relevant number\neigenspace and regarding the hopping term\nP\nV = \u2212 jh aj tjh a+\nh as a perturbation on the atomic unP\nperturbed Hamiltonian, H0 = U2 j nj (nj \u2212 1). According to standard perturbation theory, the ground\nstate of H = H0 + \u03c4 V and the relevant energy are\nexpanded\nthe perturbative parameter \u03c4 ,\nP in powers of P\n|\u03a8i = n \u03c4 n |\u03c8n i, E = n \u03c4 n \u01ebn . The perturbative corrections, obeying the hierarchy of equations\nH0 |\u03c8n i + V |\u03c8n\u22121 i =\n\nare then expanded on the eigenfunctions of H0 . Note\nthat the ground state of the latter is non-degenerate\nfor commensurate boson populations, N = n0 M , and\nM -fold degenerate in the number eigenspaces relevant\nto defect states, N = n0 M \u00b1 1. Hence we convePD\nP (\u03b1)\n(k)\nniently set |\u03c8n i =\n\u03b1 \u0393n |\u03b1i, where\nk=1 Gn |ki +\nthe quantities denoted by Latin letters refer to the Ddimensional lowest eigenspace of H0 , while those denoted\nby Greek letters refer to the remaining eigenstates. That\nis DMott = 1, Ddef = M and H0 |xi = ux |xi, with\nuk = \u016b < u\u03b1 \u2200\u03b1, k. Furthermore, for defect states,\nPM\n(1)\nwe set |ki = [Cdef ]\u22121/2 j=1 fkj bdef\nj |n0 ii, where fkj is\nhole\nthe j-th component of fk , bj\n= aj , bpart\n= a+\nj\nj , and\nNM\n|n0 ii =\nj=1 |n0 ij is the non-degenerate ground state\nof H0 in the commensurate-filling case, N = M n0 . This\nmakes the first perturbative corrections quite straightforward. Indeed, one gets |\u03c80 i = |1i, \u01eb0 = \u016b and\n(1)\n\u01ebdef\n= \u2212Cdef \u03bb1 , where \"1\" henceforth stands for k = 1.\n1\nThe subsequent corrections are obtained by projecting\nEq. (10) on suitably\neigenvectors of H0 , with the\nPchosen\nm\nassumption that k n=1 \u03c4 n |\u03c8n ik2 = 1 + o(\u03c4 m+1 ).\nHere we focus on the third order correction for defect states, containing the previously unreported terms\nin Eqs. (8) and (9). Projecting Eq. (10) with n = 2\nP\n(\u03b1)\nonto |\u03c80 i = |1i one gets \u01ebdef\n= \u03b1 h1|V |\u03b1i\u03932 , where\n3\n(\u03b1)\n\u03932 = h\u03b1|V \u2212 \u01ebdef\n1 |\u03c81 i/(\u016b \u2212 u\u03b1 ) is in turn obtained setting n = 1 and projecting onto |\u03b1i. Finally, projecting\nEq. (10) with n = 0 and n = 1 onto |\u03b1i and |ki, respectively, gives the coefficients for the first order correction,\n(\u03b1)\n\u03931 = h\u03b1|V |1i/(\u016b \u2212 u\u03b1 ) and\n\nn\nX\n\nk=0\n\n\u01ebk |\u03c8n\u2212k i,\n\n(10)\n\n(k)\n\nG1 =\n\n(\u03b1)\n\u03b1 hk|V |\u03b1i\u03931\n(1)\nCdef (\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb1 )\n\nP\n\n(2)\n\n=\n\n(1)\n\nCdef Cdef \u2032 f1 * \u03b6fk\n(1) \u03bb \u2212\u03bb\nk\n1\n2U C\n\n(11)\n\ndef\n\nPutting these results together gives\nX (\u03b1)\n(\u03b2)\n\u01ebdef\n=\n\u03931 h\u03b1|V \u2212 \u01ebdef\n3\n1 |\u03b2i \u03931\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\n+ Cdef\n\nM\nX\n\nk=2\n\ni2\nh\n(k)\n(\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb1 ) G1\n\n(12)\n\nwhose first term provides the third order correction in\nEq. (8), as well as those in Eq. (7). The second term\nin Eq. (12) is instead responsible for the \"topological\"\ncorrection in Eq. (9). Note that the latter is the lowest\norder term where the degeneracy of the ground state of\nH0 plays an explicit role. Indeed, the |ki's with k > 1 do\nnot contribute energy corrections at lower orders. In the\nnon-degenerate case, N = M n0 , the topological correction is absent also at the third order, the counterpart of\nEq. (12) featuring the first term only.\nIn the case of a physically significant quantity such as\n(k)\nthe local density of states, the \"topological terms\" G1\nin Eq.

A comparison with exact numerical diagonalization on small arrays (M \u2264 10)\nshows that Eq. (13) provides satisfactory results. A similar correction appears also in the two-point correlation,\nh\u03c8|aj a+\nh |\u03c8i, which we do not discuss here.\nThe first order correction to the local density arising from topological inhomogeneity is clearly shown in\nFig. 1, where we considered the case of a four-fold star\nnetwork38,39 (see figure caption for details).\nIn Figure 2 we compare the first Mott lobes for three\ndifferent 2D structures, namely the Euclidean lattice\n(A.), the homogeneous (B.) and an inhomogeneous (C.)\nKagom\u00e8 lattice13 . Note that the first two (homogeneous)\nstructures have the same coordination number, z = 4,\nso that the only difference between their Mott lobes,\nEqs. (2), comes from the presence of triangular loops in\nthe latter. The inhomogeneous Kagom\u00e8 lattice has the\nsame coordination as A. and B., but it features two kinds\nof hopping amplitudes and three kinds of sites (see figure\ncaption for details). Hence its Mott lobes get contributions from both Eq. (8) and Eq. (9).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we report the complete third order expansion for the ground state of the BH model on a completely arbitrary structure. We show that in the general case two kinds of previously unreported36 terms appear. The first kind arises from the presence of triangular\nloops, and contributes to the ground state energy of both\ncommensurate-filling and defect states. Due to exact cancelation only the latter influences the boundaries of the\nMott lobes. The second kind of contribution occurs in the\ndefect states of systems characterized by inhomogeneous\nhopping. As we mention above, these include superlattices with constant coordination or hopping amplitude,\nsuch as those considered in Fig. 2 (C.) or in Ref. 18, respectively. Quite interestingly, hopping inhomogeneity\nproduces perturbative terms that depend on the entire\nspectrum of the hopping matrix rather than on its maximal eigenpair. Furthermore, other than a third order\ncorrection to the ground state energy, it gives rise to a\nfirst order correction in the local density of bosons. We\nremark that, following the procedure sketched in Ref. 35,\nour results can be adapted to field-tuned transitions in\na superlattice of Josephson junctions.18 More in general\nthey supply a basis for a comprehensive study aimed at a\ndeeper understanding of the role of topology in quantum\nphase transitions19.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work of P.B. has been entirely supported by\nMURST project Quantum Information and Quantum\n\n\f5\nComputation on Discrete Inhomogeneous Bosonic Systems.
