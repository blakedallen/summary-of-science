Phys.\n\n\fLetter to the Editor\n\n2\n\nExperimentally, ultracold (T \u226a 1 K) neutral plasmas could be realized only recently\nby photoionizing a cloud of ultracold atoms [1, 2, 3]. From a plasma physics perspective,\nthey are very appealing since they might provide laboratory realizations of so-called\nstrongly coupled plasmas, where the Coulomb interaction (inversely proportional to the\nmean inter-particle spacing a) dominates the random thermal motion (proportional to\nthe temperature T ). As a consequence, interesting ordering phenomena such as Coulomb\ncrystallization can be observed. In order to be in this strong-coupling regime, a system\nhas to be either very dense (large Coulomb interaction) or very cold (little thermal\nenergy). The first scenario is realized in some astrophysical contexts, which are difficult\nto access experimentally. Hence, the possibility to realize a strongly coupled plasma\nin the laboratory by going to ultralow temperatures offered exciting prospects within\nthe plasma physics community. In [1], an ultracold neutral plasma has been created by\nphotoionizing a gas of laser-cooled Xe atoms. The extremely low temperatures of the\nXe gas suggested that the system was well within the strong-coupling regime, the socalled Coulomb coupling parameter \u0393 \u2261 e2 /(akB T ), i.e. the ratio of potential to thermal\nenergy, being of the order of 10 for the electrons and even up to 30000 for the ions\u2021.\nHowever, it was realized quickly [4, 5, 6] that despite the low temperature of the\nXe gas a strongly coupled plasma could not be created in this way. Due to the fact that\nthe neutral Xe atoms initially present interact only very weakly, the plasma is created\nin a completely uncorrelated non-equilibrium state. Hence, the subsequent conversion\nof potential into kinetic energy rapidly heats both the electron and ion subsystem,\nsuppressing the development of substantial correlations [4, 7]. This effect has been\ntermed \"disorder-induced heating\" [6] or \"correlation-induced heating\" [8], expressing\nthe fact that it is the development of spatial correlations during the relaxation of the\nplasma towards an equilibrium state which leads to an increase in temperature. Put\nanother way, in the initial non-equilibrium state the potential energy is higher than in the\ncorresponding equilibrium state of a plasma of the same average density. Consequently,\nrelaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium will reduce the potential energy in the\nsystem and increase the kinetic energy, i.e. the temperature\u00a7. Additionally, the electrons\nare heated by three-body recombination as well as continuum lowering. Suppression of\nelectron heating is thus much more difficult than simply reducing the correlation heating.\nAt present, there is a proposal of mixing the plasma with a gas of Rydberg atoms, so\nthat collisional ionization of these Rydberg atoms removes energy from the electron\ncomponent of the plasma [9].\nFor the creation of a strongly coupled ionic component, different procedures have\n\u2021 The large mass difference between electrons and ions implies a very long timescale for energy transfer\nbetween the two subsystems. Hence, for practical purposes it is justified to treat them as (almost)\nindependent and assign different temperatures to both subsystems.\n\u00a7 In view of the fact that the initial state of the plasma is far from equilibrium, it is not really justified to\nassociate a temperature with it, the properties of the system are not those of a state in thermodynamical\nequilibrium with the same kinetic energy. However, before the photoionization occurs the atomic gas\nhas a well-defined temperature, and it is the temperature of these atoms that can be compared to that\nof the ions after equilibration.\n\n\fLetter to the Editor\n\n3\n\nbeen suggested to avoid these heating effects, namely (i) using fermionic atoms cooled\nbelow the Fermi temperature in the initial state, so that the Fermi hole around each\natom prevents the occurence of small interatomic distances [7]; (ii) an intermediate\nstep of exciting atoms into high Rydberg states, so that the interatomic spacing is at\nleast twice the radius of the corresponding Rydberg state [6]; and (iii) the continuous\nlaser-cooling of the plasma ions after their initial creation, so that the correlation\nheating is counterbalanced by the external cooling [10, 11]. So far, none of these\nprocedures has been realized experimentally, however it has been shown theoretically\nthat continuous laser-cooling can indeed lead to a strongly coupled plasma, connected\nwith crystallization of the expanding system [11]. In this case, the correlation heating\neffect is still present and is offset by an additional external cooling mechanism. Proposals\n(i) and (ii), on the other hand, aim at suppressing the heating directly by avoiding\nthe small interparticle distances leading to a large potential energy, i.e. by introducing\n(spatial) correlation in the initial state. As has already been noted in [6], this could also\nbe achieved using optical lattices to arrange the atoms.\nAt this point, the question arises naturally whether the correlation heating could\nnot only be avoided, but whether it can actually be reversed and turned into cooling. As\nargued above, correlation heating describes the fact that the uncorrelated ions created in\nthe photoionization process have a higher potential energy than in the thermodynamical\nequilibrium state. Hence, equilibration will reduce the potential energy and increase the\nkinetic energy of the system, making the ions hotter than the atoms in the initial gas\nstate. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the atomic gas might be prepared in an\n\"overcorrelated\" state, where the potential energy is lower than its equilibrium value.\nIn this case, equilibration must increase the potential energy on the cost of the kinetic\nenergy, i.e. the temperature must decrease. This effect of \"correlation cooling\" has been\ndescribed before in [12] and, based on a kinetic approach, in more general terms in [13].\nIn [12], the overcorrelated initial state was achieved by suddenly decreasing the Debye\nscreening length, i.e. the temperature of the electrons, rather than by inducing spatial\norder. It was shown that in this way, a reduction in temperature of the order of a few\npercent does indeed occur for the temperatures and densities considered.\nIn the present letter, we explore an alternative scheme for achieving correlation\ncooling, namely the use of an optical lattice to induce spatial correlations in the initial\nstate as suggested in [6]. We describe, both analytically and by molecular dynamics\nsimulations, the situation of a fully ordered initial state where the atoms have been\narranged in a perfect bcc-type lattice structure using an optical lattice. In reality,\ntheir spatial distribution will be broadened, classically due to their non-vanishing\nkinetic energy corresponding to the initial-state temperature, quantum mechanically\ncorresponding to the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator potential generated by the\noptical lattice. This broadening is neglected in our numerical simulations, however,\nits influence will be discussed in the analytical considerations below. For the sake of\nnumerical simplicity, our initial state corresponds to a sphere cut out from a bcc lattice\nrather than a more realistic cylindrical shape, arguing that edge effects should be of\n\n\fLetter to the Editor\n\n4\n\nminor importance if the number of atoms in the system is large enough. The system is\npropagated using the hybrid molecular dynamics method described in [11]. Briefly, an\nadiabatic approximation is employed for the electrons, and their distribution is obtained\nfrom the steady-state King distribution [14], widely used in the study of globular clusters.\nThe ions are then propagated using the electronic mean-field obtained from the steadystate distribution and by fully taking into account the ion-ion interactions. In the\nexperiments under consideration, quasineutral plasmas with \u0393e as low as 4 * 10\u22123 [2]\nhave been realized, making Debye screening effects negligible, while ion numbers Ni\nup to 108 have been obtained [15]. For our simulations, such a large particle number\nwould lead to a prohibitively large numerical effort. However,\nq the typical timescale\n\u221a\n1/3 \u22121\nfor the plasma expansion is texp \u2248 \u0393e Ni \u03c90 , where \u03c90 = e2 /Ma3 is the Einstein\nfrequency in the Wigner-Seitz model of a Coulomb solid and M is the ion mass. On the\nother hand, the relaxation of the ions takes place on a timescale of trel \u2248 \u03c90\u22121 . Hence,\nthe same macroscopic behavior can be obtained by decreasing Ni and increasing \u0393e ,\nkeeping the ratio texp /trel fixed. Therefore, for our simulations we chose Ni = 105 and\nan initial electron energy corresponding to \u0393e = 0.5, while the bare Coulomb potential\nwas used for the ion-ion interaction.\nFigure 1(a) shows the time evolution of the average ion kinetic energy in units of the\ninitial-state temperature for a typical realization. Since the initial lattice configuration\nproduces an effective oscillator potential for each ion, the relaxation process is connected\nwith transient oscillations of the kinetic energy which are damped out due to ion-ion\ncollisions. Additionally, the average kinetic energy increases at later times due to a\nradial ion acceleration caused by the thermal electron pressure, which is proportional to\nthe density gradient. Therefore the slow expansion of the unconfined plasma leads to a\nsoftening of the initially sharp plasma edge and a modification of the velocity distribution\nin the outer region of the plasma only. Since this distribution is close to a Maxwellian\nin the central region of the plasma, the average kinetic energy is directly related to\nthe ionic temperature T , while it becomes more and more dominated by the expansion\nenergy towards the edge of the plasma. In order to highlight these edge effects, we have\ncalculated the average ion kinetic energy from the velocity distribution in the inner\nregion only, taken to be a sphere with half of the initial plasma radius. The resulting\ncurve is shown as the dashed line in figure 1(a). Clearly, the expansion hardly affects the\nkinetic energy in the inner region of the plasma, leaving only the oscillations which are\ndamped out as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. As discussed above,\nthe relaxation of the ions towards equilibrium takes place on a timescale of \u03c90\u22121 , while\n\u221a\n1/3\nthe typical timescale for the plasma expansion is \u0393e Ni \u03c90\u22121. Hence, a sufficiently\nlarge number of ions allows for an almost unperturbed relaxation in the inner plasma\nregion so that a temperature can be defined in a meaningful way. (For a strontium\nplasma with a typical density of 5 * 109 cm\u2212 3 used, e.g., in [15], \u03c90\u22121 \u2248 0.2 \u03bcs, while\ntexp is about 30 times larger for \u0393e = 4 * 10\u22123 and Ni = 108 .) Using the absorption\nimaging techniques described in [15] it should be possible experimentally to probe this\ninner region only. Therefore, we chose to define the final temperature as given by the\n\n\f5\n\nLetter to the Editor\n2\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n0.9\n\n(b)\n\n200\n\n1.5\n\nTf\nTi\n\n180\n160\n\nTf\nTi 0.7\n\n1\n\n140\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n\u0393f =174\n\n\u0393f\n\n0.8\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n\u0393i\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c90t\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n\n\u0393i\n\nFigure 1.

The resulting Tf was estimated from the center of the remaining\noscillations and is shown in figure 1(b) as a function of \u0393i by the full circles. It should\nbe noted that the value of \u0393i has no meaning as a measure of nonideality of the initial\nplasma state, since the system may be far from equilibrium. Therefore, in the present\ncase it should simply be viewed as a density-scaled inverse temperature rather than a\nCoulomb coupling parameter. As can be seen in the figure, the ratio of final to initial\ntemperature reaches a constant value of about 0.5 as the initial temperature goes to zero.\nHence, cooling can indeed be achieved on a moderate level of a temperature reduction\nof about 50 percent.\nFor large particle numbers and if \u0393e is small enough such that three-body\nrecombination and Debye screening can be neglected, quasineutrality leads to a\nhomogeneous electron background in the central plasma region. Thus, we can use the\none-component plasma model to gain more insight into the cooling process. This model\nhas been studied extensively over the last decades [16, 17], which led to a detailed\nunderstanding of the equation of state over a wide parameter range. In the classical\nregime, the energy per particle of the final equilibrium state is given by\n3\n3\n(1)\nUf = kB Tf + Wf \u2261 ( + wf )kB Tf ,\n2\n2\nwhere the excess energy W accounts for nonideal effects due to the inter-particle\nCoulomb interaction. For this quantity, several fit formulae can be found in the\nliterature, which have been obtained by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods\n[16, 17, 18]. In the fluid phase we use the interpolation formula from [19]\n!\n\nA3\nA\n\u221a 1\n+\n,\n(2)\nw (\u0393f ) =\n1 + \u0393f\nA2 + \u0393f\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere A1 = \u22120.9052, A2 = 0.6322 and A3 = \u2212 3/2 \u2212 A1 / A2 .

In the solid phase (\u0393 > 174), the excess energy can be described by\nan expansion in powers of 1/\u0393 [17]\nc\n1\na\nb\n3\n+ 2 + 3 +O\nw (\u0393f ) = \u2212Am \u0393f + +\n2 \u0393f\n\u0393f\n\u0393f\n\u03934f\ns\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a = 10.84, b = 352.8 and c = 1.794 * 105 . Here, the first term corresponds to the\nMadelung energy of the lattice, with Am = 0.895929 for a bcc-type lattice. The second\nterm describes thermal contributions corresponding to an ideal gas of phonons while the\nhigher-order terms account for anharmonic corrections. Assuming an unchanged ionic\nphase-space distribution function directly after the photoionization, where the spatial\ndistribution due to the finite temperature is represented by Gaussian profiles centered\non the sites of the bcc lattice, the internal energy of the initial nonequilibrium state is\ngiven by\n\uf8ee\n\n3\n\u0393i hr 2 i 7\nhr 2 i\n3\nUi = kB Ti +Wi = kB Ti \u2212kB Ti Am \u0393i +kB Ti \uf8f0 2 \u2212 B\n2\n2\n2 a\n8\na2\n5\n\n!2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n, (4)\n\nwhere B = 21 i,j ra5 , with B = 0.876719 for a bcc lattice.

Figure 1(b) shows the ratio\nTf /Ti as a function of \u0393i for hr 2 i /a2 = 0, i.e. for a point-like ionic density at the lattice\nsites. A comparison with our numerical data shows that equation (6) reproduces the\nnumerical values for a finite-size plasma quite well. The remaining discrepancies should\nbe attributable to finite-size effects [21, 22]. At small values of \u0393i the temperature ratio\nstarts out from unity and decreases with increasing \u0393i , since the excess potential energy\nof the final fluid state is naturally larger than that of the initial lattice configuration.\nAs \u0393i exceeds a value of \u0393i \u2248 70 the temperature ratio rises linearly, connected with a\nsolidification of the plasma, where \u0393f = 174 stays constant (see inset). In this regime,\nregions of fluid and solid phases coexist in the plasma. At \u0393i \u2248 84 the system has\ncrossed the melting point and the temperature ratio approaches a value of 1/2. This\nfactor of 1/2 originates from the additional thermal energy of 3kB Tf /2 arising from\nthermal lattice excitations. However, the situation changes if a finite extension of the\ninitial charge distribution at the lattice sites is considered.

(b) Phase diagram for the final plasma state in the f -\u0393i plane.\n2\n\n(hr 2 i /a2 ) in equation (4), one finds that for finite \u03c9L the temperature approaches a\nvalue of (1 + \u03c902 /\u03c9L2 )/2 if hr 2 i \u226a a2 .\nLet us now turn to the question of the influence of possible lattice defects, i.e. how\nperfect must the initial-state lattice be in order to observe correlation cooling? Such\ndefects are easily accounted for in the previous consideration. Introducing a filling factor\nf , defined as the probability that a given lattice site is occupied, simply reduces the\naverage charge at each lattice site. Therefore, the potential energy of the initial state\ncan be written as f 2 wi (\u0393\u22c6i )kB Ti , where \u0393\u22c6i corresponds to the temperature scaled by\nthe density of the perfectly filled lattice, which is related to the actual value of \u0393i by\n\u0393\u22c6i = f \u22121/3 \u0393i . Substituting this in equation (4) yields\n3/2 + f 2 wi (f \u22121/3 \u0393i )\nTf\n=\nTi\n3/2 + wf (\u0393f )\n\n(7)\n\nas the generalization of equation (6) to non-perfect filling. In figure 2(a), we show the\nresulting final temperature as a function of the filling factor for two different \u0393i . A\ndecreasing filling enhances the initial potential energy (compared to that of a full lattice\nwith the same average density, not the same lattice constant), leading to a rapid increase\nof the final temperature. As a consequence, cooling can be achieved for a nearly perfect\nlattice only. Furthermore, for a fixed f < 1, increasing \u0393i leads to larger values for\nthe temperature ratio. This heating also influences the possibility of the creation of a\ncrystallized plasma phase, since the melting point of \u0393f = 174 is shifted to larger values\nof \u0393i , as shown in the phase diagram figure 2(b). For values of f < 0.9855, the system\nalways ends up in the fluid phase independent of \u0393i .\nThe above picture suggests that, for a perfect initial state, cooling is always\npossible independent of the initial temperature. At low enough temperatures, however,\nthe classical treatment will break down, and quantum mechanical effects will become\nimportant. As in the classical case the quantum statistical internal energy of a\nCoulomb solidk can be written as a sum of the Madelung energy, harmonic contributions\nk As mentioned previously, for typical experimental setups as in [1], \u0393i is of the order of 10000, i.e.\n\n\f8\n\nLetter to the Editor\n\narising from linear lattice excitations and anharmonic corrections. For the harmonic\ncontributions to the excess energy we use an analytic approximation formula obtained\nrecently [23], which reproduces the numerical results for harmonic Coulomb crystals very\naccurately. The anharmonic corrections are taken from [24], where they were obtained\nby fitting the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting expression is\ntoo lengthy to be reproduced here, but incorporates both the known semiclassical hightemperature limit as well as the quantum mechanical groundstate energy of a Coulomb\ncrystal,\n!\n\n\u03b8\n0.365\n(8)\nwgs = \u2212Am \u0393f + 1.329\u03b8 \u2212 \u221a \u03b8 + O 3/2 .\nrs\nrs\nHere, \u03b8 = (h\u0304\u03c90 )/(kB T ) measures the importance of quantum effects, i.e. zero-point ion\noscillations, and rs = aMe2 /h\u03042 is the Wigner-Seitz radius in units of the ionic Bohr\nradius. As in the previous classical considerations, we apply a sudden approximation\nassuming an unchanged density matrix directly after the photoionization pulse. The\ninitial energy of the plasma is thus found from the expectation value of the new\nHamiltonian using a density matrix representing independent harmonic oscillators\narranged on a bcc lattice.

The final temperature is again\nobtained by equating the initial and final energies of the plasma. Figure 3 shows \u0393f\nas a function of \u0393i for rs = 2 * 109 . In contrast to the classical case, here the final\ntemperature cannot be decreased to arbitrarily low values, rather it approaches a finite\nconstant value as Ti \u2192 0, since the initial charge distributions at the lattice sites have\na finite extension at Ti = 0 due to zero-point oscillations.

We may rewrite equation (12) as \u03bbT /a = 2\u03c0/[ rs (1 \u2212 \u03a9)] \u2212\u2192\n\u221a\n7.424rs\u22121/4 , where \u03bbT = h/ 2\u03c0MkB Tf is the thermal deBroglie wavelength. This would\nsuggest that it is possible to reach the degenerate regime of \u03bbT /a \u2248 1 if rs can be\ndecreased sufficiently, i.e. to a value rs \u2248 3*103. Even for hydrogen this would correspond\nto an unrealistically large density of 4 * 1023 cm\u22123 . Note, however, that the value of rs\nenters the ratio \u03bbT /a with a power of 1/4 only, so that values of \u03bbT /a = 1/10 can\nalready be reached if rs \u2248 3 * 107 , corresponding to a density of 4 * 1011 cm\u22123 , which\nhas already been surpassed with cold Bose-condensed hydrogen atoms [25]. In this\nregime, the present considerations will not hold, since effects of particle statistics will\nbe important which have not been included in the above expressions for the energies.\nHowever, equation (12) might serve as an estimate for the parameter values necessary\nto reach the degenerate regime.\nIn summary, we have discussed the possibility of correlation cooling and of the\ncreation of a strongly coupled ultracold neutral plasma by photoionization of a highly\nordered state of cold atoms, achievable with optical lattices. Classical considerations\nhave shown that the initial temperature can be reduced by a factor of two if the atomic\nsample is noninteracting initially, offering the possibility to reach ion temperatures which\nhave not been achieved so far. The quantum regime has been investigated using existing\nexpressions for the equilibrium internal energy of the system. Here it was found that the\nfinal temperature approaches a constant value which arises from zero-point oscillations\n\n\fLetter to the Editor\n\n10\n\nin the lattice potentials and depends on the density as well as the geometry of the optical\nlattice. An almost perfect lattice is necessary to observe the discussed cooling effects,\nsince even a small amount of lattice defects largely increases the final temperature.\nHowever, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to create regular structures with\na well-defined number of atoms localized in the potential wells of an optical lattice [26].\nFinancial support from the DFG through grant RO1157/4 is gratefully\nacknowledged.\nReferences\n[1] Killian TC, Kulin S, Bergeson SD, Orozco LA, Orzel C and Rolston SL 1999 Phys.
