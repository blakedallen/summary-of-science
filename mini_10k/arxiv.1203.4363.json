In this note we provide a counterexample to a conjecture due to F. Gouv\u00eaa, which says that the Krull dimension of\nthe universal deformation ring - as defined by B. Mazur - associated to an absolutely irreducible residual representation could be\nexpressed by the dimension of the group cohomology of the adjoint\nrepresentation.\n\n1. Introduction\nMotivated by H. Hida's work [Hid86] on certain one-parameter families of p-adic Galois representations attached to ordinary p-adic cusps\nforms, B. Mazur lay in his seminal paper [Maz89] the cornerstone for\na systematic study of such families by founding the deformation theory of residual representations of pro-finite groups. In many cases all\nsuch deformations of a residual representation to complete Noetherian\nlocal rings can be parametrized by a universal deformation ring. So\nif we want to understand \"how many\" lifts exist to a given residual\nrepresentation, it is very natural to ask about the size of the universal\ndeformation ring. This question is as old as the deformation theory of\nresidual representations itself. Already B. Mazur observed in his fundamental paper [Maz89] that we can give a lower bound for the Krull\ndimension of the universal deformation ring in terms of the group cohomology of the adjoint representation. The question about equality is\nthe subject of the \"Dimension conjecture\" due to F. Gouv\u00eaa as stated\nin [Gou95, Conjecture 1] and [Gou01, S. 287]:\nConjecture (Dimension conjecture). Let \u03c1\u0304 : G \u2192 GLn (k) be an absolutely irreducible residual representation of a pro-finite group G such\nthat the universal deformation ring Runiv (\u03c1\u0304) exists. Then we have\nKrulldim(Runiv (\u03c1\u0304)/p * Runiv (\u03c1\u0304)) = h1 \u2212 h2\nwith\nh1 := dimk H 1 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) and h2 := dimk H 2(G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)).\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11F80.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJOHANNES SPRANG\n\nHere Ad(\u03c1\u0304) denotes the associated adjoint representation given by the\naction of \u03c1\u0304 on Mn (k) by conjugation.\nIn this note we will give a counterexample to this conjecture. The\nidea is the following: In [Zub87] A.N. Zubkov shows that for p 6= 2\nevery closed pro-p subgroup of GL2 (R) for an arbitrary pro-finite ring\nR satisfies some pro-p identity. If we take an appropriate representation\nof a pro-finite group G satisfying this relation, there should be hope\nthat this relation is not seen in the universal deformation ring but\nshould be seen by cohomology.\nBy far the most interesting examples in the deformation theory of\nresidual representations are given by representations of Galois groups\nof number fields with restricted ramification. As already pointed out\nby B. Mazur in [Maz89], the Dimension conjecture for Galois representations should be seen as a vast generalization of Leopoldt's conjecture.\nSince our counterexample is constructed from an abstract group it does\nnot directly touch the question about the Krull dimension of the deformation ring in the case of Galois representations, but in a certain\nsense it shows which problems have to be taken care of when dealing\nwith the case of Galois representations.\nThe idea for this counterexample arose out of my Diploma thesis\nunder the mentoring of Prof. N. Naumann. I would like to use this\nopportunity to thank Prof. N. Naumann for introducing me to the deformation theory of Galois representations and for all mentoring advice\nduring the development of my thesis.\n2. The Deformation functor\nIn this section we recall some basic results from the deformation theory of residual representations. Let p be a prime and k be a finite field\nof characteristic p. Fix a continuous representation \u03c1\u0304 : G \u2192 GLn (k) of\na pro-finite group G satisfying the following finiteness condition:\n(\u03a6p ) The pro-p-completion of every open subgroup G0 of G is topological finitely generated.\nSuch a representation \u03c1\u0304 will be called residual representation. We consider the category C of complete Noetherian local rings with residue\nfield k. The morphisms of C are homomorphisms of local rings which\ninduce the identity on the residue field k. A lift of \u03c1\u0304 to R \u2208 C is a\ncontinuous homomorphism \u03c1 : G \u2192 GLn (R) whose reduction modulo\nthe maximal ideal mR of R coincides with \u03c1\u0304. Two lifts of \u03c1\u0304 are called\nstrict equivalent if they are conjugate by an element \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(R) :=\nker(GLn (R) \u2192 GLn (k)). A strict equivalence class of lifts is called\ndeformation. The deformation functor D\u03c1\u0304 (R) on C assigns to every\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE TO GOUV\u00caA'S DIMENSION CONJECTURE\n\n3\n\ncomplete Noetherian local ring R the set of all deformations of a given\nresidual representation \u03c1\u0304. The following result is due to B. Mazur:\nTheorem 1 (B. Mazur, [Maz89]). If \u03c1\u0304 : G \u2192 GLn (k) is absolutely\nirreducible and G satisfies the finiteness condition (\u03a6p ), then D\u03c1\u0304 is\nrepresentable.\nFor such absolutely irreducible \u03c1\u0304 the representing object Runiv (\u03c1\u0304) \u2208 C\nwill be called universal deformation ring.\n2.1. Deformation of tame representations. If the order of the image of \u03c1\u0304 is prime to p the residual representation is called tame. In the\ntame case N. Boston developed in [Bos91] group theoretical techniques,\nwhich allow in many cases an explicit calculation of the universal deformation ring. We will recall some of these techniques: In the following\nwe will fix a non-trivial tame residual representation \u03c1\u0304 : G \u2192 GLn (k)\nof a pro-finite group G satisfying the finiteness condition (\u03a6p ). Since\n\u0393(R) is a pro-p group for every R \u2208 C, every lift \u03c1 of \u03c1\u0304 to R will factor\nthrough G/N with N defined via the maximal pro-p quotient ker \u03c1\u0304/N\nof ker \u03c1\u0304. For studying all deformations of \u03c1\u0304 we may thus assume in the\nfollowing without loss of generality that P := ker \u03c1\u0304 is a pro-p group. Set\nA := im\u03c1\u0304, then the pro-finite version of Schur-Zassenhaus allows us to\nchoose a lift \u03c3W (k) : A \u0592\u2192 GLn (W (k)) of the inclusion A \u0592\u2192 GLn (k) of\nthe image of \u03c1\u0304 to the ring of Witt vectors W (k) of k. Because W (k) is\ninitial in C, the choice of \u03c3W (k) yields compatible lifts \u03c3R : A \u0592\u2192 GLn (R)\nfor every R \u2208 C. Using these lifts we let act A on \u0393(R) and P by conjugation. The set of all continuous A-invariant homomorphisms from P\nto \u0393(R) will be denoted by HomA (P, \u0393(R)). Now we have the following\nresult due to N. Boston:\nTheorem 2 (N. Boston, [Bos91, (6.1) Proposition]). If \u03c1\u0304 : G \u2192\nGLn (k) is absolutely irreducible, then there is a natural equivalence\nof functors:\nHomA (P, \u0393(*)) \u2192 D\u03c1\u0304 (*)\n3. Auxiliary results: Representations and group theory\nFor the construction of our counterexample the choice of the image of\nthe residual representation will be essential. A faithful representation\nof the symmetric group S3 will be a good choice:\nLemma 3. Let k be a field of characteristic different form 2, 3. Up\nto equivalence there are exactly three (absolutely) irreducible representations of S3 over k: The trivial 1-dimensional representation 1, the\n1-dimensional sign representation \u03c1sign and the faithful two dimensional\n\n\f4\n\nJOHANNES SPRANG\n\nstandard representation \u03c1std : S3 \u0592\u2192 GL2 (k). The adjoint representation Ad(\u03c1std ) of \u03c1std is isomorphic to 1 \u2295 \u03c1sign \u2295 \u03c1std .\nProof. By assumption the order of S3 is prime to the characteristic of\nthe field k, thus all representations are semi-simple. Further, the prime\nfield of k is already a splitting field for S3 . Now, all assertions follow\nby looking at characters of S3 .\n\u0003\nOne of the main ingredients of the counterexample is the following\nresult of A. N. Zubkov:\nTheorem 4 (A. N. Zubkov). Let p 6= 2 be a prime and R be a commutative pro-finite ring. There is no continuous injective ring homomorphism from a non-abelian free pro-p group onto a closed subgroup\nof GL2 (R).\nProof. [Zub87, Theorem 4.1] and [Zub87, Theorem 2.1].\n\n\u0003\n\n4. The counterexample\nIn this section we will give a counterexample to the following conjecture of F. Gouv\u00eaa:\nConjecture (Dimension conjecture). Let \u03c1\u0304 : G \u2192 GLn (k) be an absolutely irreducible residual representation of a pro-finite group G satisfying the finiteness condition (\u03a6p ) with universal deformation ring\nRuniv (\u03c1\u0304). Then the Krull dimension of Runiv (\u03c1\u0304)/p * Runiv (\u03c1\u0304) is given by\nKrulldim(Runiv (\u03c1\u0304)/p * Runiv (\u03c1\u0304)) = h1 \u2212 h2\nwith\nh1 := dimk H 1 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) and h2 := dimk H 2(G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)).\nLet p 6= 2, 3 be a prime and fix a faithful representation i : S3 \u0592\u2192\nGL2 (Fp ). Choose compatible lifts \u03c3R : S3 \u2192 GL2 (R) as in 2.1 by\nusing Schur-Zassenhaus and let S3 act on \u0393(R) by conjugation. Let\nus consider the ring R := Zp JX1 , X2 , X3 , X4 , Y1 , Y2, Y3 , Y4 K and the\nelements\n!\n\n!\n\nX1 X2\nY Y\nX := 1 +\nand Y := 1 + 1 2\nX3 X4\nY3 Y4\nin \u0393(R). Let P be the subgroup of \u0393(R) topologically generated by all\nS3 -conjugates of X and Y:\nn\n\no\n\nn\n\no\n\ni(a)Xi(a)\u22121 : a \u2208 S3 \u222a i(a)Yi(a)\u22121 : a \u2208 S3 .\n\nThus S3 acts continuously on P . We define G as the associated semidirect product P \u22ca S3 . Since P is a topologically finitely generated\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE TO GOUV\u00caA'S DIMENSION CONJECTURE\n\n5\n\npro-p group, it is obvious that G satisfies the finiteness condition (\u03a6p ).\nThe absolutely irreducible residual representation\nG\n\n//\n\nS3 \u001f\n\u007f\n\ni\n\n/\n\nGL2 (Fp )\n\nwill be called \u03c1\u0304. Now we can state our counterexample:\nExample 5. Let p 6= 2, 3 be a prime and \u03c1\u0304 : G = P \u22ca S3 \u2192 GL2 (Fp )\nas constructed above. The universal deformation ring of the absolutely\nirreducible representation \u03c1\u0304 is given by:\nR = Zp JX1 , X2 , X3 , X4 , Y1 , Y2 , Y3, Y4 K\nThe universal deformation is induced by the inclusion:\nG \u0592\u2192 GL2 (R)\nIn particular KrulldimRuniv (\u03c1\u0304)/pRuniv (\u03c1\u0304) = 8. On the other hand we\nhave:\nh1 := dimFp H 1 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) = 8 and h2 := dimFp H 2 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) \u2265 1\nand thus:\nKrulldimRuniv (\u03c1\u0304)/pRuniv (\u03c1\u0304) > h1 \u2212 h2\nProof. We use N. Boston's description of the deformation functor as\nHomS3 (P, \u0393(*)) for tame representations as given in Theorem 2. Let\nF be the free pro-p group on two generators x and y and consider the\nhomomorphism \u03a6 : F \u2192 P given by x 7\u2192 X and y 7\u2192 Y. We first\nshow:\nStep 1: We have the following bijection, functorial in R \u2208 C:\nHomS3 (P, \u0393(R))\n\u03c6\u2724\n\n/\n\nHompro-p (F, \u0393(R))\n/\n\n\u03c6\u25e6\u03a6\n\nInjectivity is obvious since every S3 -invariant homomorphism out of\nP is determined by the images of X and Y . Conversely let \u03c8 \u2208\nHompro-p (F, \u0393(R)) be given with\na a\n\u03c8(x) = 1 + 1 2\na3 a4\n\n!\n\nb b\nand \u03c8(y) = 1 + 1 2\nb3 b4\n\n!\n\nfor ai and bi in the maximal ideal mR of R. The ring homomorphism\nR \u2192 R given by Xi 7\u2192 ai , Yi 7\u2192 bi induces an S3 -invariant homomorphism \u03c6 : GL2 (R) \u2192 GL2 (R) with (\u03c6|P ) \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03c8.\nThe functor Hompro-p (F, \u0393(*)) is clearly represented by R. The fact\nthat the universal deformation is given as indicated above follows immediately by making the natural equivalences between Hompro-p (F, \u0393(*))\nand D\u03c1\u0304 (*) explicit. In particular, we get dimFp H 1 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) = 8, since\n\n\f6\n\nJOHANNES SPRANG\n\nH 1 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) is isomorphic to the Zariski tangent space of the functor\nD\u03c1\u0304 (*). It remains to show:\nStep 2: H 2 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) 6= 0\nSince the order of S3 is prime to p, the Hochschild-Serre spectral\nsequence yields:\n(1)\nH 2 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) \u223c\n= H 2 (P, Ad(\u03c1\u0304))S3\nSince P acts trivial on Ad(\u03c1\u0304), we get an isomorphism of Fp [S3 ]-modules:\n(2)\nH 2(P, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) \u223c\n= H 2 (P, Fp ) \u2297 Ad(\u03c1\u0304)\nCombining (2) and (1) we obtain:\nH 2 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)) \u223c\n= HomF\n\np [S3 ]\n\n(H 2 (P, Fp )\u2217 , Ad(\u03c1\u0304))\n\nAs every irreducible Fp [S3 ]-module occurs in Ad(\u03c1\u0304), and since Zubkov's\ntheorem implies that H 2 (P, Fp)\u2217 is non-trivial, we can conclude the\nnon-triviality of H 2 (G, Ad(\u03c1\u0304)).\n\u0003\nThis gives also an example of an irreducible residual representation\nwith non-free pro-p kernel having a universal deformation ring without\nrelations, i.e. a power series ring.\nReferences\n[Bos91] Nigel Boston, Explicit deformation of Galois representations, Invent.\nMath. 103 (1991), no. 1, 181\u2013196.
