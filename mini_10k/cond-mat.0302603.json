INTRODUCTION\n\nLocalized opening of double-stranded DNA is essential\nin a number of cellular processes such as the initiations\nof gene transcription and DNA replication [1]. While\nthermal denaturation is highly unlikely under physiological conditions, in vitro experiments show that local denaturation can be readily induced by under-winding the\nDNA double helix by an amount that is physiologically\nreasonable [2, 3, 4]. The basic physical effect is simple:\nAn under-wound double helix suffers a reduction in the\nbinding free energy [5, 6, 7]. Local openings of the double helix (referred to as \"denaturation bubbles\") relieve\nthe twist experienced by the remainder of the double helix and is thus energetically favorable. The denaturation\nbubbles may be recruited to a specific location of the\ngenome by a designed (e.g., AT-rich) sequence, since AT\npairs bind more weakly than GC pairs [8]. On the other\nhand, entropic effect which favors bubble delocalization\nis non-negligible for long sequences. Also significant is\nthe kinetic trapping of the bubbles due to statistical agglomeration of AT-rich segments in long heterogenous sequences.\nTo gain some quantitative understanding on the competing effects of entropy and sequence heterogeneity,\nwe characterize in this study the thermodynamic and\ndynamic properties of denaturation bubbles in a long,\nstretched random DNA sequence with no special sequence design. Previously, there have been a number\nof experimental and theoretical studies [9, 10, 11, 12] on\nthe effect of sequence heterogeneity on DNA melting and\nunzipping transitions. Our study is along this general\ndirection. The specific behaviors exhibited by the denaturation bubbles are rather complex and are typical of\nthose observed in systems dominated by quenched disorders [13]: The bubbles are localized upon increase of the\napplied torque beyond a certain threshold. In the localized regime, their dynamics exhibits \"aging\" [14, 15] and\nis sub-diffusive with continuously varying exponents.\nInterestingly, twist-induced denaturation presents a\nrare physical example of the celebrated random-energy\n\nmodel of disordered system [16]. Consequently, detailed\nanalysis of both the thermodynamis and dynamic properties can be made by applying the well-developed theory of disordered systems [13], together with exact results from large-deviation theory familiar in the related\nsequence alignment problem [17, 18]. We will draw upon\ndetailed experimental knowledge of thermal denaturation [19, 20, 21] throughout the analysis, and make our\nresults quantitative whenever possible.\n\nII. THERMODYNAMICS\n\nLet us consider the application of a torque which\nunder-winds a long, stretched1 piece of double-stranded\nDNA. We are interested in the regime where the applied\ntorque T is below the threshold Td for bulk denaturation,\nbut sufficiently strong so that denaturation bubbles do\nappear in the system. Due to the highly cooperative nature of the denaturation process, the typical distance N\u00d7\nbetween the large bubbles is large, in which case treating\nthe bubbles as a dilute gas of particles is appropriate.\nOur strategy will be to first characterize analytically the\nthermodynamic behavior of a single bubble, and then\nuse this knowledge to determine the length scale N\u00d7 and\nthe many-bubble states for N \u226b N\u00d7 . We will find that\nN\u00d7 > O(103 ) bp as long as we are not very close to the\nthreshold Td , so that the dilute gas approximation is reasonable for a large range of parameters.\n\nA. The Single-bubble Model\n\nConsider a denaturation bubble confined in a DNA\ndouble helix between two complementary DNA strands\nof N bases each. The double-strand is denoted by the\n\n1\n\nA modest stretching force is needed to prevent the applied torque\nfrom being absorbed by super-coiling; see e.g., Ref. [6].\n\n\f2\nbase sequence b1 b2 . . . bN [with bk \u2208 {A, C, G, T}] of one of\nthe strands, ordered from the 5'- to 3'- end. To simplify\nthe notation, we assume that the two ends of the helix\nis sealed, so that the bubble is always contained in the\nsegment b1 . . . bN . Let the index of the first and last open\npairs of the open bubble be m and n, with 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264\nN . We denote the total free energy of the bubble (defined\nwith respect to the helical state) by \u2206GL (m), where L \u2261\nn \u2212 m + 1 is the number of open bases and referred to\nas the bubble length. Then the partition function of the\nsingle-bubble system is given by\nZ(N ) =\n\nN N \u2212L+1\nX\nX\n\nL=1\n\ne\n\n\u2212\u03b2\u2206GL (m)\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nm=1\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u22121 \u2261 kB T \u2243 0.62 kcal/mole at 37\u25e6 C.\nIn the absence of the external torque, the bubble energy \u2206GL (m) has two components. First, there is the\nloss of stacking energy \u03b4Gb,b\u2032 between two successive\nbases b and b\u2032 . These stacking energies are in the range\n0.5 \u223c 2.5 kB T 's at 37\u25e6 C, with the AT stacks weaker than\nthe GC stacks. Their values have been measured carefully [19, 20, 21]. Second, assuming that there is no secondary pairing between bases in the bubble so that the\nopen configuration can be regarded as a polymer loop,\nthere is a well-known polymeric loop entropy cost\n\u03b3L = \u03b31 + \u03b1 * kB T ln L\n\n(2)\n\nfor a bubble of length L, with \u03b1 \u2248 1.8 [22] for a linearly\nextended 2 DNA chain. The bubble initiation cost \u03b31\ndepends on the base composition at opening and closing\nends, ionic strength etc., and generally lies3 in the range\n3 \u223c 5 kB T . For relevant bubble sizes of few tens of bases\nin length (see below), the total entropic cost is \u03b3L =\n8 \u223c 12 kB T . This large cost justifies the single bubble\napproximation (at least to the length scale N\u00d7 \u223c e\u03b2\u03b3L >\n\u223c\n5 \u00d7 103 bp), and contributes significantly to the sharpness\nof the observed thermal denaturation transition [21].\nAn applied negative torque T reduces the thermodynamic stability of the helical state relative to the denatured one by an amount equal to the work done to unwind the helix. This effect is simply modeled here by\na linear decrease in the stacking energy in the relevant\nparameter range [6], i.e., \u03b4Gb,b\u2032 \u2192 \u03b4Gb,b\u2032 \u2212 \u03b80 T , where\n\u03b80 = 2\u03c0/10.35 is the twist angle per base of the double\nhelix. Putting the above together, we have\n\u2206GL (m) = \u03b3L +\n\nm+L\nX\nk=m\n\n2\n\n3\n\nas the single bubble energy, which can be computed once\nthe DNA sequence b1 ...bN is given. Note that while\nEq. (3) is formulated specifically for twist-induced denaturation, the general form can be used to describe a\nnumber of destabilizing effects, e.g., due to changes in\ntemperature, ionic concentration, etc.\n\nB. Sequence Heterogeneity\n\nAs the torque T increases from zero towards the denaturation point Td , denaturation bubbles appear in the\ndouble strand and grow in size. We wish to know whether\nthe bubbles are free to diffuse along the double strand,\nor are they localized in the high AT regions of the DNA\nwhere binding is the weakest. For simplicity, we will\ncharacterize the typical behavior of an ensemble of random (i.e., independent and identically distributed) sequences described by the single-nucleotide frequencies pb ,\nalthough our approach and qualitative findings are also\napplicable to sequences with short-range correlations.\nFor a given sequence of bases, the partition function\nZ can of course be efficiently evaluated numerically (including all the multiple-bubble states) by using available\nprograms such as MELTSIM [21]. All thermodynamic\nquantities can subsequently be evaluated from the free\nenergy F = \u2212kB T ln Z. To obtain the typical behavior\nof the ensemble, we ideally want to compute the ensemble average of the free energy, F \u2261 \u2212kB T ln Z. [We use\nthe over-line to denote average over the ensemble of ranQN\nP\ndom sequences, i.e., X \u2261\nk=1 pbk ;\nb1 ,...,bN Xb1 ,...,bN\nthis is also known as the \"disorder average\".] Computing F numerically however will require explicit generation of a large number of random sequences and can be\nvery time consuming for large N 's. Fortunately we can\napply a large body of knowledge accumulated from the\nstatistical mechanics of random systems [13] and provide\na detailed characterization of the typical behavior of our\nsystem without the need of exhaustive simulation. To\nintroduce notation and concepts in this approach, we examine first the simplified problem of a single bubble with\na fixed length.\n\nC. Bubble with Fixed Length\n\n\u03b4Gbk\u22121 ,bk \u2212 \u03b80 T * L\n\n(3)\n\nThe value of \u03b1 may well be different for unstretched DNA chain\nand hence relevant for the thermal denaturation of DNA [23, 24].\nHowever, as we show below, essential features of denaturation do\nnot hinge on the precise value of \u03b1.\nThe initiation cost for DNA bubbles are extracted from the\nwebserver: http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/ (M.\nZuker, private communication). See also Ref. [25] for an alternative source.\n\nLet us consider a bubble with a fixed length L (with\n1 \u226a L \u226a N ) embedded in a long, random sequence\nb1 ...bN . The partition function reads\nZL =\n\nN \u2212L+1\nX\n\nexp[\u2212\u03b2\u2206GL (m)],\n\n(4)\n\nm=1\n\nwhere the scripted variables refer to properties of the\nfixed length bubble. For a random sequence, the energies\nof the different states labeled by m are uncorrelated with\n\n\f3\neach other beyond the distance L. Such systems belong 4\nto the class of \"Random Energy Model\" (REM) and was\nsolved exactly in the 80's by Derrida [16] for a Gaussian\ndistribution of \u2206G's. Discrete distribution of \u2206G's was\nstudied in the closely-related system involving proteinDNA interaction [26]. Below, we will briefly review the\nsalient properties of REM using the present example.\nThe REM has a \"high-temperature\" phase where many\n(of order N ) bubble configurations contribute significantly to the partition sum, and a \"low-temperature\"\nphase dominated by only one or a few lowest energy\nstates. It follows that, in the former case, the bubble\nis delocalized and can freely diffuse along the sequence,\nwhile in the latter case, the bubble is localized to the lowest energy position. Transition between the two phases is\ndriven by competition between the energetic (variation in\n\u2206G) and entropic (ln N ) effects. In the present problem,\nthe magnitude of terms in the partition sum (4) can be\ntuned not only by varying the temperature, but also by\nvarying the bubble size L. Hence, at a fixed \u03b2, whether\na bubble is free or localized depends both on the bubble\nsize L and the sequence length N .\nAn interesting property of the REM is that, in the\n\"high-temperature\" phase, ZL /N tends to a finite limit\ngiven by the annealed average Z L /N as N \u2192 \u221e, independent of the particular realization of the random\nsequence. This allows us to replace the average free\nenergy F \u2261 \u2212kB T ln Z by its annealed approximation\nFe \u2261 \u2212kB T ln Z, which is much easier to calculate.

Using Eqs. (8) and (9),\nwe can write the condition for phase transition as\n\nwhich gives the minimal bubble size for localization at a\ngiven N . With the values of \u03b4G's obtained from Ref. [19]\nat [Na+ ] = 1 M and 37\u25e6 C, and assuming an equal nucleotide distribution (i.e., pb = 1/4 for all bases), we\nfind f \u2248 1.83 kB T , \u03b5 \u2248 1.50 kB T , so that H \u2248 0.33 and\nLloc \u2248 20 bp for N \u223c 103 bp. From Eq. (10), it is clear\nthat as N \u2192 \u221e any fixed-length bubble remains delocalized.\nD. Bubble without Length Constraint\n\nThe full partition function Z is obtained simply\nby summing ZL for different L's.\nWe will again\napproach the problem by first applying the annealed approximation and then determining where it breaks down.\n1. Annealed approximation: The annealed partition func-\n\nPN\ntion Z(N ) \u2261 L=1 Z L has a transition at Ta = f (\u03b2)/\u03b80 ,\nwhere the exponential factor in (7) reaches one: The sum\nover L is finite and Z \u221d N only if T < Ta . In this regime,\nthe annealed free energy is simply Fe \u2248 \u2212kB T ln N + \u03b31 .\ne \u2261 \u2212 \u2202 ln Z(\u03b2) is also readily\nThe annealed energy E\n\u2202\u03b2\ne = \u03b31 +[\u03b5(\u03b2)\u2212\u03b80 T ]* L\ne\ncomputed; it can be expressed as E\nPN \u2192\u221e\ne\nwhere L(T ) \u2261\nL=1 L Z L /Z is the average bubble\nlength in the annealed approximation. As T approaches\ne ) diverges, and the annealed entropy\nTa , L(T\ne\nSe = ln N \u2212 \u03b2[\u03b80 T \u2212 \u03b5(\u03b2)] * L\n\n(11)\n\nF \u2261 \u2212kB T ln Z \u2243 \u2212kB T ln N\n\n(12)\n\nbecomes negative.\nIn the limit N \u2192 \u221e, the anealed free energy Fe is\nactually identical to F for all T \u2264 Ta . This can be seen\nfrom the inequalities ln ZL=1 \u2264 ln Z \u2264 ln Z, and ZL=1 >\nN min{exp[\u2212\u03b2\u2206G1 ]}. Since both the lower and upper\nbounds grow as ln N ,\n\nfor all T \u2264 Ta .\n\n\f4\n2. Ground-state properties: To find the ground-state of\n\nthe unconstrained bubble in a long random sequence, we\nneed to study the statistics of stretches of exceptionally\nhigh AT-content. If we neglect the polymeric contribution\n\u03b3L to the bubble energy [to be justified shortly], then\nthe ground-state energy E \u2217 expected in a sequence of\nlength N can be computed exactly from large-deviation\ntheory [17, 27], with\nE \u2217 (N ) \u2248 \u2212\u03bb\u22121 ln N.\n\n(13)\n\nThe constant \u03bb in Eq. (13) can be expressed as the unique\npositive root of the equation\nf (\u03bb) = \u03b80 T ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere f is defined by the \u03b4G's through Eqs. (5) and (6).\nNote that, at T = Ta , Eq. (14) is satisfied with \u03bb = \u03b2.\nIn this case, (13) coincides with (12).\nThe length of the minimal energy bubble is also known\nfrom large-deviation theory [18, 27], with\nL\u2217 (T ) = ln N/H \u2217 (T ),\n\n(16)\n\nFrom the logarithmic dependence of the bubble length\nL\u2217 on N , it is clear that the corresponding polymeric\ncontribution \u03b3L\u2217 \u223c ln(ln N ) can indeed be treated as a\nconstant shift of bubble energy.\n3. Phase transitions: Based on the above discussion, a\n\nphase transition can be formally established in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e. This is seen by comparing the expressions\n(12) and (13). For T > Ta , solution to (14) satisfies\n\u03bb < \u03b2. Consequently, (12) must break down there, yielding a phase transition at T = Ta . Since F \u2264 E \u2217 in\ngeneral (e.g., for all T > Ta ), and at the phase transition point T = Ta the equality F = E \u2217 already holds,\ni.e., the ground-state already dominates, then we must\nhave the ground-state dominating throughout the localized phase. This is exactly the behavior of the random\nenergy model [16].\nA physical understanding of the transition can be obtained by examining the importance of the ground-state\ncontribution exp(\u2212\u03b2E \u2217 ) \u223c N \u03b2/\u03bb to the partition sum Z\nas the applied twist T is varied. For T < Ta , the ratio\n\u03b2/\u03bb(T ) is less than one. In this case, the energy gain\nE \u2217 (N ) of placing the bubble at the site of the lowest energy is insufficient to overcome the entropy ln N of placing the bubble in different positions, hence the bubble is\ntypically small and delocalized. When T exceeds Ta , the\nground-state contribution grows faster than N , signalling\ndominance of one or a few low energy states where the\nbubble typically resides. The transition is thus identified\nas the localization transition of the bubble at Tloc = Ta .\nThe onset of the zero entropy point can be obtained\nfrom Eq. (11) and written as\ne T ),\nln N = H(\u03b2, T ) * L(\u03b2,\n\nH(\u03b2, T ) = \u03b2 * [\u03b80 T \u2212 \u03b5(\u03b2)]\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nis the relative entropy of the unconstrained bubble.\nThese equations are analogous to the expressions (15)\nand (16) for the ground-state bubble. In fact, both\nL\u2217 (T ) and H \u2217 (T ) are reproduced through the substie\ntution \u03b2 \u2192 \u03bb(T ), e.g., L\u2217 (T ) = L(\u03bb(T\n), T ). This turns\nout to be true also for other thermodynamic variables.\nThus the localized phase at different T 's can be viewed\nas the phase transition points of systems with different\neffective temperatures \u03bb\u22121 (T ); this will be clearly manifested in the bubble dynamics discussed below.\nNext we observe that since H \u2217 \u221d \u03bb [see Eq. (16)], the\nbubble length diverges (or approaches N ) as \u03bb \u2192 0. This\ndefines the point of bulk denaturation6 Td , i.e.,\n\u03b80 Td \u2261 lim f (\u03bb) = \u03b4G,\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the relative entropy H \u2217 is given exactly by\nH \u2217 (T ) = \u03bb(T ) * [\u03b80 T \u2212 \u03b5(\u03bb)].\n\nwhere\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the second equality is obtained from manipulating\nEqs. (5) and (6). Using \u03b4G \u2248 1.40 kB T [derived from\nthe \u03b4G's in Ref. [19]], we find Td \u2248 10 pN * nm. The\ndependence of \u03bb on T close to Td can be obtained from\nthe expansion\nf (\u03bb) = \u03b4G \u2212\n\n\u03bb\nvar(\u03b4G) + O(\u03bb2 ).\n2\n\n(20)\n\nInverting the above for \u03bb using (14) and (19), we find\n\u03bb(T ) =\n\n\u0001\n\u00012\n2\u03b80\nTd \u2212 T + O Td \u2212 T .\n\u03b2var(\u03b4G)\n\n(21)\n\nIt turns out that the term linear in Td \u2212 T in (21) already gives a very good approximation (to within 1%)\nof \u03bb throughout the localized phase where \u03bb/\u03b2 < 1.\nThe localization transition point Tloc can be thus obtained by solving Eq. (21) with \u03bb(Tloc ) = \u03b2. Using\n\u03b2 2 var(\u03b4G) \u2248 0.565 [derived from Ref. [19]], we find\nTd \u2212 Tloc \u2248 2 pN * nm. Unlike the value of Td which is\nderived from the average stacking energy \u03b4G and hence\nsensitive to temperature, ionic strength, etc., the difference Td \u2212 Tloc is set by the variance of \u03b4Gb,b\u2032 and should\nbe much less sensitive to experimental conditions. The\nsame is expected for the relative entropy, which has the\nform\nH \u2217 (T ) \u2248 2\u03b802 (Td \u2212 T )2 /var(\u03b4G)\n\n(22)\n\nthroughout the localized phase.\n\n6\n\nNote however that the helical segments separating adjacent bubbles can be stable even beyond Td , so that complete separation\nof the two strands takes place at T > Td .\n\n\f5\nE. Multiple bubbles\n\nA. Model\n\nThe localization transition discussed above occurs only\nas N \u2192 \u221e. However for large N , the single-bubble approximation will break down regardless of the large (but\nfinite) bubble cost \u03b3L . When multiple bubbles are localized, each bubble is effectively in a finite-length system,\nthereby blurring the localization transition.\nWe first analyze the delocalized phase for which the annealed approximation is valid. Once multiple bubbles are\nallowed in the system, we expect a broad range of bubble lengths, as described by the distribution (7). Qualitae ) to\ntively, we expect only the largest bubbles, of size L(T\nbe localized as T \u2192 Tloc , while the smaller ones remain\ndelocalized. We shall thus focus on these large bubbles:\nIt is the average separation distance N\u00d7 between these\nlarge bubbles that sets the effective system size of the\nsingle-bubble localization problem.\nThe Boltzmann weight of one such large bubble in a\ne \u03b1 in the\ne is W\nf (N ) = e\u2212\u03b2\u03b31 N/L\nsequence of length N \u226b L\nf (N ) = 1\nvicinity of the localization transition. Setting W\nyields the typical spacing between the large bubbles on\nthe delocalized side,\n\nFor simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the description of the movement of a single-bubble over its lifetime,\nwhich can be rather long in the localized phase. For reasons discussed above, interaction with other bubbles can\nbe neglected when the bubble displacement is within a\ndistance of order N\u00d7 \u223c 103 bp. We will also neglect the\npolymeric loop entropy \u03b3L which provides essentially a\nconstant shift to the bubble energy as shown in the single bubble section.\nIn addition to the drift and breathing motion, a bubble\nmay also shrink to zero size and disappear from the system. To our knowledge, the time scale involved for the\nspontaneous collapse of a bubble, particularly under an\napplied twist, has not been documented so far. Zipping\nthe bubble requires not only pairing of the bases in the\nopen segment, but also rewinding of the helix against the\napplied undertwist, both of which contribute to the energy barrier to the no-bubble state. This suggests a long\nlifetime for a bubble, which can be enforced by setting\na lower bound (e.g., 10 bp) in the allowed bubble length.\nHowever, as we will see, the long-time behavior of bubble dynamics is determined crucially by the occurrence\nof the large bubble states, and insensitive to the value\nof the lower bound on L, as long as the L = 0 state is\nexcluded. Once accurate estimates of bubble lifetime become available, one may supplement the discussion below\nwith such a cutoff.\n\ne \u03b1 (T ).\ne\u00d7 \u2248 e\u03b2\u03b31 L\nN\n\n(23)\n\nNote that for bubbles of size 10 bp's, the crossover length\nis already of the order of 103 bp's. A similar estimate can\nbe made on the localized phase using the exact expression [28] for the lowest energy for multiple bubbles. We\nfind\n\u0015\u03bb(T )/\u03b2\n\u0014\n\u2217 \u03b1\n\u2217\n\u03b2\u03b31\n(L )\n.\n(24)\nN\u00d7 \u2248 e\nas the average distance between large bubbles of size L\u2217 .\nFor N \u226b N\u00d7 , the system consists of N/N\u00d7 effective number of single-bubble subsystems, each of length\nN\u00d7 . At the localization \"transition\" of an infinite\ne\u00d7 = H(\u03b2, Tloc )L(T\ne loc ) [see\nsystem then, we have ln N\nEq. (17)]. Together with Eq. (23) [or (24) with \u03bb = \u03b2],\ne loc ) \u2248 25 bp at the onset of localization (uswe find L(T\ning \u03b31 \u2248 3 kB T and H \u2248 0.33), with the crossover length\ne\u00d7 \u2248 6500 bp. Thus we expect there to be typically one\nN\nbubble of \u223c 25bp in a random DNA double-strand of\nlength \u223c 6500 bp's at the localization transtion.\nIII. BUBBLE DYNAMICS\n\nThe localization of bubbles is reflected ultimately in\ntheir slow dynamics. We expect bubbles to diffuse freely\nalong the DNA double-helix in the delocalized phase, but\nbecome trapped in low energy positions in the localized\nphase. Details of the bubble movement in the latter case,\nhowever, can be rather complicated with nontrivial memory (or \"aging\") effects typical of glassy states [14, 15] as\nwill be described below.\n\nB. Scaling Theory\n\nEquation (13) gives the lowest energy of an unconstrained bubble in a sequence of length N , while a bubble with its position (but not size) fixed typically has\nan energy of the order \u03bb\u22121 for T < Tloc . For small \u03bb,\nthe energy variation \u2206E(N ) \u2243 \u03bb\u22121 ln N is large, hence\nthe bubble dynamics is dominated by the thermal escape from the deepest trap. The escape time is thus\nte (N ) \u2243 e\u03b2\u2206E(N ) \u223c N \u03b2/\u03bb , i.e., the dynamics is subdiffusive deep in the localized phase (where \u03b2 \u226b \u03bb).\nTo investigate the dynamical behavior in more detail, especially close to the localization transition where\n\u03bb \u2248 \u03b2, we need to include also the random motion of\nthe bubble along the double strand. Towards this end,\nit is useful to describe the bubble dynamics as a single point moving in the two-dimensional space spanned\nby the bubble's only two degrees of freedom, its instantaneous length L and the position of one of its ends, say m.\nThe statistics of the two-dimensional energy landscape\n\u2206GL (m) is well-characterized by the large-deviation theory [18]. It consists of a number of valleys, whose depths\nb are given by the Poisson distribution\n(denoted by \u2206G's)\nD\n\n\u0010\n\nb\n\u2206G\n\n\u0011\n\n\u221de\n\nb\n\u2212\u03bb \u2206G\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the constant defined through (14).

(26) can be written as\nte (N ) \u221d N z , with the dynamic exponent z given by\n\u001a\n2\nfor \u03bb > \u03b2 (or T < Tloc )\nz=\n1 + \u03b2/\u03bb for \u03bb < \u03b2 (or Tloc < T < Td )\n(27)\nThe anomalous exponent z > 2 in the glass phase shows\nexplicitly that the dynamics is slow, i.e., sub-diffusive.\n\n4\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1.

We note that the\nobserved exponents follow the general trend predicted,\nchanging continuously from 1/z = 0.5 close to the expected location of the glass transition (Tloc \u2248 0.8Td ), towards zero as T \u2192 Td . For T close to Td , the dynamics\nbecomes exceedingly slow, making it difficult to access\nthe asymptotic region. For T \u2248 Tloc , we also observed\nsome finite-size effect. The overall agreement between the\nscaling theory and numerical results is within 5 \u223c 10%\nover the range tested.\nIn Fig. 2(a), we show the dependence of the average\nbubble length on time for different T 's. The data depict the slow, logarithmic growth of the bubble length.\nLogarithmic growth is one of the signatures of glassy dynamics. Its occurrence in this particular system can be\nunderstood quantitatively as follows: The optimal bubble size L\u2217 (N ) in a segment of length N depends logarithmically on N ; see Eq. (15). On the other hand, for a\nbubble placed at an arbitrary position in a long sequence,\nthe effective sequence length is the distance the bubble\ncan explore within a time t, i.e., N \u223c t1/z for the subdiffusive dynamics expected in the glassy regime.

We impose local dynamics in which the bubble can only change its length L or shift its end position\nm by a single base, as long as L \u2265 1.

We note that the difference\nbetween the data (circles) and the upper bound is nearly\nconstant (\u2248 1) for the range studied.\nPerhaps the most characteristic feature of\nglassy dynamics is that the system \"ages\", e.g., the temporal fluctuation of the system depends on how long the\nsystem has evolved from some (arbitrary) initial condition [14, 15]: The longer it has evolved, the slower it\nfluctuates. This is easy to understand in the context of a\nrough energy landscape with deep valleys and high barriers, since the longer the system evolves, the deeper the\nenergy valley it finds, and hence the higher the barrier it\nwill have to overcome to travel farther. This feature is in\nmarked contrast to sub-diffusive hydrodynamic systems\nwhich are time-translationally invariant.\nQuantitatively, we can define the aging phenomenon\nvia the time-dependent correlation function C(tw , \u2206t),\nwhich measures how much the system changes in time \u2206t,\nafter first evolving for a waiting period tw from the initial\ncondition. Let us define a binary variable \u03b7i (t) \u2208 {0, 1},\nfor each base i of the nucleotide sequence. \u03b7i (t) takes on\nthe value 1 if base i is open and belongs to the bubble at\ntime t, and the value 0 if base i is paired.\nThe correlation\nP\n\u03b7\n(t\nfunction, defined as C(tw , \u2206t) \u2261\ni\nw )\u03b7i (tw + \u2206t)\ni\nafter averaging over 10000 random sequences, is a measure of the average self-overlap of the bubble at time tw\nand tw + \u2206t. A more convenient quantity to characterize isPthe fraction of overlap, C(tw , \u2206t)/L(tw ), where\nL(t) = i \u03b7i (t) is the instantaneous bubble length.\nIn Fig. 3(a), we show the overlap fraction, parameterized by the different waiting time tw 's for the system\nbiased deep in the glass phase with T = 0.9 Td . The\noverlap fraction clearly depends on the waiting time, illustrating the glassy nature of the dynamics. In contrast, the same quantity computed for T < Td (data not\nshown) gives no statistically significant dependence on\ntw . To characterize more quantitatively the behavior, we\n2.

We find these curves to collapse reasonably\nonto a single master curve which exhibits a weak kink at\n\u2206t/tw \u223c 1. A naive explanation of this behavior is that\nfor \u2206t \u226a tw , the bubble stays approximately within the\nenergy valley found at time tw , while for \u2206t \u226b tw , the\nbubble makes excursion far away from the valley. For\nthe one-dimensional \"trap\" model, it was shown rigorously [33] that C(tw , \u2206t) indeed scales as a function of\n\u2206t/tw , even though the largest trap time actually scales\nsub-linearly with tw . This behavior can be understood\nin terms of the particle making multiple returns to the\noriginal valley after escaping it [32], as manifested by the\nslow decay shown in Fig. 3(b) for \u2206t \u226b tw .\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this study we investigated the thermodynamic and\ndynamic behaviors of twist-induced denaturation bubbles in a long, random sequence of DNA. The small bubbles associated with weak twist are delocalized, e.g., they\nflicker in and out of existence according to the Boltzmann\ndistribution and are independent of the DNA sequence.\nThe bubbles increase in lengths upon increase in the applied torque. When the largest bubbles reach a critical\nsize Lloc which is of the order of a few tens of bases, the\nbubbles become localized to AT-rich segments which occur statistically in a long random sequence. According\nto the parameters [19] taken at 37\u25e6 C with [Na+ ] = 1 M,\nthe localization \"transition\" occurs at Tloc \u2248 8 pN * nm,\nwhich is \u223c 80% of the torque needed for bulk denaturation Td . In the localized regime, the bubbles exhibit\n\"aging\" and move along the double helix sub-diffusively,\nwith continuously varying dynamic exponents.\nAll of the results are obtained under the single-bubble\napproximation. Thermodynamically, we expect this approximation to be valid for DNA sequences of several\nthousand bases or less. This is due to the strongly cooperative nature of bubble formation, as manifested in\nthe large initiation energy \u03b31 . The single bubble description of dynamics is further restricted by the finite\nlife time of the bubble: Even at length scales where\nthe single-bubble approximation is appropriate thermodynamically, the bubble may annihilate and reappear\nelsewhere in the sequence, effectively performing longdistance hops. Experimental knowledge of the bubble\nlife time in the presence of an applied twist is needed to\nestimate the crossover time to the long-distance hopping\nregime. Qualitatively, we expect these bubbles to have\nmuch longer life times than the thermally denatured bubbles, since the applied twist plays the role of an energy\nbarrier preventing bubble annihilation.\nFinally, we note that bubble localization characterized\nin this study is a reflection of the statistical background\npresent in long random nucleotide sequences. This background traps the bubble kinetically if the bubble size becomes sufficiently large. Thus, to localize denaturation\n\n\f8\nbubbles at appropriate locations specified by designed\nsequences (e.g., promoters or replication origins) for biological functions, it is necessary to operate away from\nthe localized regime, i.e., below the onset of localization.\nThis collaboration was made possible by the program\non \"Statistical Physics and Biological Information\"\nhosted by the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa\nBarbara.
