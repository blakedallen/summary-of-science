The schematic of baseline configuration of the\nlinac is shown in Fig. 2. It includes an ion source which\nprovides 5 mA pulsed beam of H- ions. The beam is\naccelerated through the RFQ which is operated at room\ntemperature at 325 MHz frequency. The RFQ is followed\nby Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) section\nwhich is used to chop the beam in order to get the time\nstructure which is necessary to operate the different\nexperiments simultaneously. The MEBT is followed by\nSC linac, which is segmented into two sections: low\nenergy part and high energy part. The low energy section\n(2.5-160 MeV) uses three families of SC single spoke\nresonators i.e. SSR0, SSR1 & SSR2 which are operated at\n325 MHz. The high energy section of the SC linac (160\n___________________________________________\n\n*Work supported by IUSSTF and US DOE\n#\nasaini@fnal.gov\n\nMeV-3.0 GeV) uses two families of 5 cell SC elliptical\nshape cavities i.e. =0.61 and =0.9 which are operated at\n650 MHz. Numbers of beam line elements(RF cavities,\nsolenoids and quadrupoles) in each section along with\ntheir transition points are summarized in Table 1.\n\nFigure. 2: Acceleration scheme for CW linac.\nTable 1: No. of elements along with transition energy.\nSSR0 SSR1 SSR2\n=0.6\n=0.9\nCavities\n18\n20\n40\n36\n152\nSolenoids\n18\n20\n20\n0\n0\nQuads\n0\n0\n0\n24\n38\nCM\n1\n2\n4\n6\n19\nPeriod\n0.61\n0.80\n1.60\n5.00\n15.40\nlength (m)\nSection\n10.98 16.40 33.20 60.00\n292.60\nlength (m)\nTransition\n10.18 42.58 160.5 515.4\n3028.3\nenergy, MeV\nOperation of the SC linac at CW mode puts high\ntolerances on beam transport elements, particularly on RF\ncavities. Failure of the beam transport elements like\ncavity, solenoid and quadrupole alters the focusing period\nof the beam, resulting in a mismatch of the beam with the\nsubsequent sections. This, in turn, causes beam losses. In\nsome cases, failure of the beam transport element results\nin complete beam losses and it becomes necessary to\nreplace this element for nominal operation of the\nmachine. These beam interruptions reduce the beam\navailability for the different experiments. To achieve high\nperformance and hence reliability of the machine, it is\nnecessary to include this scenario during the design of the\nSC linac lattice. It should have a capability that RF cavity\nor magnet failure could be compensated locally by using\nthe neighbouring elements. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthe compensation of failure of RF cavity and solenoid for\nthe most critical case of failure of first cavity and first\nsolenoid in SSR0 section. We would also like to\nemphasize that even though the latest design of SC CW\nlinac [2] differs marginally, however studies presented in\nthis paper can be taken as guideline.\n\nFAILURE OF RF CAVITY\nFailure of a cavity components (tuner, power coupler,\netc.), degradation of RF cavity surface during operation\n\nOperated by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC02-07CH11359 with the United States Department of Energy.\n\n\fare such scenarios which could be results in degradation\nof performance of RF cavity. Calculations have been\nperformed to study the effects of failure of RF cavity,\nespecially in the low energy section of the SC linac where\nbeam is non-relativistic and space charge effect\ndominates. Due to cavity failure, significant deformation\nin the longitudinal phase space takes place, which in turn\ninduces strong envelope oscillations and halo formation.\nThrough the coupling, a significant enhancement of halo\nformation in the transverse phase space is also introduced.\n\nremains unaffected from failure effects of rf cavity. Thus,\nin this situation to operate the SC linac without beam\nlosses it is necessary to compensate this effect.\n\nFailure of first RF cavity in SSR0 section\nAnalysis is done to compensate the effects of failure of\nfirst RF cavity in SSR0 section with minimal user\ndisruption. Neighbouring elements are retuned in order to\nachieve designed beam energy and smooth beam\npropagation through the linac. It is considered most\ncritical case as beam energy is very low and only few\nelements are available to retune the lattice. It is ensured\nthat maximum surface magnetic field in SSR0 cavity\nshould be below 60 mT which is a limitation for spoke\nresonators in 325 MHz section. Another constraint is the\nmagnetic field in solenoid that should be less than 6 T/m.\nSimulation is performed using multi-particle tracking\ncode TRACEWIN (PARTRAN) [3]. Beam r.m.s.\nenvelopes and normalized emittances are shown in Fig. 3\ncalculated from tracking of 10k macro-particles through\nnominal SC linac lattice (no misalignment errors and no\nfailure of beam line elements).\n\nFigure 4: Transverse (x, y) and Longitudinal (a) r.m.s.\nbeam envelope and (b) Emittance after tracking through\nthe SC linac with failure of first cavity in SSR0 section.\nIn the compensation scheme a few elements in the\nvicinity of failed elements are re-adjusted (RF phase and\nfield amplitude of RF cavity and field gradient of the\nsolenoid and quad) to achieve designed energy and\nsmooth beam propagation through the SC linac. All the\ncavities in the SC linac are operated with independent RF\nsources, which provide the freedom of varying the RF\nphase and field amplitude of each cavity separately. Fig. 5\nshows the beam profile (zoomed region around the failed\ncavity) after compensation of the failed cavity.\nNeighbouring beam transport elements used for readjustment are highlighted in green colour: two cavities\n(referred as Gaps), two solenoids and a quad triplet in the\nupstream MEBT section, one solenoid in the same period\nof the failed cavity, and one solenoid and one cavity in\neach of the two downstream periods (after the failed\ncavity). The final emiitance dilution after compensation is\nshown in Figure 6. It can be easily seen that emittance is\nimproved significantly and no beam losses happen after\napplying compensation scheme.\n\nFigure 3: Transverse (x, y) and Longitudinal (a) r.m.s.\nbeam envelope (xrms,yrms & zrms) and (b) normalized\nEmittance after tracking through the SC linac without\nany failure of beam transport elements.\nFigure 4 shows the beam profile and normalized\nemittance through the SC linac in case of the failure of\nfirst cavity in SSR0 section. It can be seen that\nlongitudinal profile of the beam blows up which results in\nemittance dilution and increase in beam losses.\nSignificant beam losses mostly happened in transition\nbetween sections causes reduction of longitudinal\nemittance and beam size. Transverse profile of the beam\n\nFigure 5: Beam profile in transverse plane (top) &\nlongitudinal plane (bottom) in presence of a failed cavity\nafter its compensation.\n\n\fFigure. 6: Longitudinal (blue) and transverse (magenta)\nemittance dilution through SC linac in presence of failed\ncavity with compensation scheme.\n\nFAILURE OF TRANSVERSE FOCUSING\nELEMENTS\nStudy of failure of transverse focusing elements\n(Solenoids & Quads) is also performed. It is found that\nfailure of first focusing element (solenoid) in SC CW\nlinac is as critical as failure of first RF cavity in SSR0\nsection. It results mismatch in transverse plane and leads\nemittance dilution and hence beam losses. Fig. 7 beam\nprofile and normalized emittances along the linac after\nfailure of first solenoid in SSR0 section. Compensation\nscheme is applied to mitigate failure's effect and\nachieving smooth beam propagation through the linac.\nTwo cavities (referred as Gaps), two solenoids and a quad\ntriplet in the upstream MEBT section, one cavity in the\nsame period of the failed solenoid, and one solenoid and\none cavity in each of the two downstream periods (after\nthe failed solenoid) are used to retune the beam optics. It\ncan be observed from Fig. 8 that performance of the linac\nis restored to the nominal after applying compensation\nscheme.\n\nFigure 8: a) Transverse (x,y) and longitudinal(z) r.m.s.\nbeam envelopes and (b) emittances along the SC linac in\npresence of failed solenoid after compensation.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe method of compensation of failure of elements in\nbeam line is demonstrated for most critical cases i.e.\nfailure of first solenoid and rf cavity in SSR0 section.\nResults are summarized in Table2. It can be concluded\nthat it is possible to operate linac with failed elements\nafter applying compensation scheme.\nTable 2: Beam Energy and Emittances at End of Linac\nfor different cases.\nParameters\n\nNo Failure\n\nAfter Failure\nBefore\nCompensation\n\nAfter\nCompensation\n\nFailure of first cavity in SSR0 section\nz (pi.mm.mrad)\n\n0.18\n\n0.74\n\n0.21\n\nt(pi.mm.mrad)\n\n0.258\n\n0.27\n\n0.255\n\nEenergy (MeV)\n\n3028\n\n3027\n\n3028\n\nFailure of first solenoid in SSR0 section\nz (pi.mm.mrad)\n\n0.18\n\n0.34\n\n0.208\n\nt(pi.mm.mrad)\n\n0.258\n\n1.7\n\n0.262\n\nEenergy (MeV)\n\n3028\n\n3028\n\n3028\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 7: a) Transverse (x,y) and longitudinal r.m.s.\nbeam envelopes and (b) emittances along SC linac in the\npresence of failure of the first solenoid in SSR0 section.\n\n[1] S.D.
