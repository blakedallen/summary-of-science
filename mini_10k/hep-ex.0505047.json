Both collider experiments, CDF and D0, expect to\ncollect up to 8 fb\u22121 of data in this new run period. The increase in instantaneous luminosity, center-of-mass energy (from 1.8 TeV to 2 TeV) and the\nimproved acceptance of the detectors will allow stringent tests of the Standard\nModel (SM) predictions in extended regions of jet transverse momentum, PTjet ,\nand jet rapidity, Y jet . The hadronic final states in hadron-hadron collisions\nare characterized by the presence of soft contributions (the so-called underlying event) from initial-state gluon radiation and mutiple parton interactions\nbetween remnants, in addition to the jets of hadrons originated by the hard\ninteraction. A proper comparison with pQCD predictions at the parton level\nrequires an adequate modeling of these soft contributions which become important at low Pjet\nT . In this letter, a review of some of the most important QCD\nresults from Run II is presented.\n2\n\nInclusive Jet Production at the Tevatron\n\nThe measurement of the inclusive jet production cross section for central jets\nconstitutes one of the pillars of the jet physics program at the Tevatron. It provides a stringent test of perturbative QCD predictions over almost nine orders\nof magnitude and probes distances up to \u223c 10\u221219 m. Thanks to the increase in\nthe center-of-mass energy in Run II the jet production rate has been multiplied\n(by a factor of five for jets with PTjet > 600 GeV) and the first measurements\nhave already extended the PTjet coverage by 150 GeV compared to Run I. In\naddition, both CDF and D0 experiments explore new jet algorithms following\nthe theoretical work that indicates that the cone-based jet algorithm employed\nin Run I is not infrared safe and compromises a future meanful comparison\nwith pQCD calculations at NNLO. Figure 1 shows the measured inclusive jet\ncross section by CDF using the longitudinally invariant KT algorithm 1) and\nbased on the first 145 pb\u22121 of Run II data. Measurements have been performed\nusing values for the D parameter in the KT expression,\nKij = min(p2T,i , p2T,j ) *\n\n(yi \u2212 yj )2 + (\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j )2\n,\nD\n\n(1)\n\nequal to 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0. The measurements are compared to pQCD NLO calculations 2) using CTEQ6 3) parton density functions in the proton and\nantiproton and the renormalization and factorization scales set to pmax\nT /2.\nThe measured cross section is reasonably well described by the predictions\nfor PTjet > 150 GeV within the present uncertainties. The systematic errors on\n\n\fFigure 1: The measured inclusive jet cross section compared to pQCD NLO predictions. Jets are seached for using the longitudinally invariant KT algorithm.\n\nthe data are dominated by the uncertainty on the jet energy scale determination while the theoretical predictions suffer from our limited knowledge of the\ngluon distribution at high x. At lower PTjet , the data is systematically above\nthe predictions and the effect increases as D increases (see Figure 2). This indicates the presence of soft-gluon contributions and fragmentation effects that\nhave not been taken into account yet.\n\nFigure 2: Ratio between the measured inclusive jet cross section and the pQCD\nNLO predictions using the KT algorithm with D=0.5 and D=0.7, respectively.\nFigure 3 shows the measured inclusive jet cross section by D0 based on\nthe first 143pb\u22121 of Run II data. The new midpoint 4) jet algorithm has been\nused with a cone size R=0.7. This algorithm constitutes an improved version of\nthe cone-based algorithm used in Run I and it is shown to be infrared safe when\nused in fixed-order parton-level calculations. The data is in good agreement\n\n\fwith the pQCD NLO predictions using CTEQ6 parton density functions and\nRsep = 1.3. However, the measurement is dominated by a relatively large\nuncertainty on the absolute jet energy scale. Figure 4 shows the measured\n\nFigure 3: The measured inclusive jet cross section by D0 compared to pQCD\nNLO predictions.

This measurement is particularly sensitive to the presence of\nnarrow resonances decaying into jets of hadrons up to masses of 1.3 TeV. The\ndata is well described by pQCD NLO predictions.\n\nFigure 4: The measured inclusive dijet cross section by D0 as a function of the\ndijet mass compared to pQCD NLO predictions.\nNowadays, the Tevatron high-PTjet jet data is used, together with promptphoton data from fixed target experiments, to constrain the gluon distribution\nat high-x. Jet measurements at large rapidities are important because they\n\n\fconstrain the gluon density in a region in PTjet where no effect from new physics\nis expected. The D0 experiment has already extended the jet cross section\nmeasurements to the forward region for jets with |y| < 2.4 (see Figure 5). At\n\nFigure 5: (Left) measured inclusive jet cross section by D0 in different regions\nof rapitidy compared to pQCD NLO predictions.(Right) ratio between the measurements and the pQCD NLO predictions for jets with 2.0 < |y| < 2.4.\nthe moment, the results are affected by large systematic errors. In the near\nfuture the experiments will highly reduce their uncertainties and precise cross\nsection measurements will allow to further constrain the gluon distribution and\nthus enhance their sensitivity to new physics at very high PTjet .\n3\n\nStudy of the Underlying Event\n\nAs mentioned in previous section, the hadronic final states at the Tevatron\nare characterized by the presence of soft underlying emissions, usually denoted as underlying event, in addition to highly energetic jets coming from\nthe hard interaction. The underlying event contains contributions from initialand final-state soft gluon radiation, secondary semi-hard partonic interactions\nand interactions between the proton and anti-proton remnants that cannot\nbe described by perturbation theory. These processes must be approximately\nmodeled using Monte Carlo programs tuned to describe the data. The jet energies measured in the detector contain an underlying event contribution that\nhas to be subtracted in order to compare the measurements to pQCD predictions. Hence, a proper understanding of this underlying event contribution is\ncrucial to reach the desired precision in the measured jet cross sections. In\nthe analysis presented here, the underlying event in dijet production has been\nstudied by looking at regions well separated from the leading jets, where the\nunderlying event contribution is expected to dominate the observed hadronic\n\n\factivity. Jets have been reconstructed using tracks with ptrack\n> 0.5 GeV and\nT\n|\u03b7 track | < 1 and a cone algorithm with R=0.7. The \u03c6 space around the leading\njet is divided in three regions: towards, away and transverse (see Figure 6-left),\nand the transverse region is assumed to reflect the underlying event contribution. Figure 6-right shows the average track density in the transverse region\n\nFigure 6: (Left) Scheme of the different \u03c6 regions defined around the leading jet.\n(Right) Measured average track density in the transverse region as a function of\nthe ETjet of the leading jet. The measurements are compared to different Monte\nCarlo models.\nas a function of ETjet of the leading jet for the dijet inclusive sample and for\nevents where the leading jets are forced to be back-to-back in \u03c6, in order to\nfurther reduce extra hard-gluon radiation. The observed plateau indicates that\nthe underlying event activity is, to a large extend, independent from the hard\ninteraction. The measurements have been compared to the predictions from\nPYTHIA 5) and HERWIG 6) Monte Carlo programs including leading-order\nQCD matrix elements plus initial and final parton showers. The PYTHIA\nsamples have been created using a special tuned set of parameters, denoted as\nPYTHIA-Tune A, which includes an enhanced contribution from initial-state\nsoft gluon radiation and a tuned set of parameter to control secondary parton\ninteractions. It was determined as a result of similar studies of the underlying\nevent performed using CDF Run I data 7) . PYTHIA-Tune A describes the\nhadronic activity in transverse region while HERWIG underestimates the radiation at low ETjet . Similar measurements in Z+jet(s) events would allow to\nexplore the univesality of the underlying event contribution in events with a\nvery different colour configuration in the final state.\n\n\f4\n\nJet Shapes\n\nThe internal structure of jets is dominated by multi-gluon emissions from the\nprimary final-state parton. It is sensitive to the relative quark- and gluon-jet\nfraction and receives contributions from soft-gluon initial-state radiation and\nbeam remnant-remnant interactions. The study of jet shapes at the Tevatron\nprovides a stringent test of QCD predictions and tests the validity of the models for parton cascades and soft-gluon emissions in hadron-hadron collisions.\nThe CDF experiment has presented results on jet shapes for central jets with\ntransverse momentum in the region 37 GeV < PTjet < 380 GeV, where jets are\nsearched for using the midpoint1 algorithm and a cone size R = 0.7. The integrated jet shape, \u03a8(r), is defined as the average fraction of the jet transverse\nmomentum that lies inside a cone of radius r concentric to the jet cone:\n\u03a8(r) =\n\n1 X PT (0, r)\n,\nNjet\nPT (0, R)\n\n0\u2264r\u2264R\n\n(2)\n\njets\n\nwhere Njet denotes the number of jets. The measured jet shapes have been\ncompared to the predictions from PYTHIA-Tune A and HERWIG Monte Carlo\nprograms.\n\nFigure 7: The measured integrated jet shape compared to different Monte Carlo\npredictions.\nIn addition, two different PYTHIA samples have been used with default parameters and with and without the contribution from multiple parton interactions (MPI) between proton and antiproton remnants, the latter denoted as\nPYTHIA-(no MPI), to illustrate the importance of a proper modeling of softgluon radiation in describing the measured jet shapes. Figure 7(left) presents\n1\n\nA 75% merging fraction has been used instead of the default 50%.\n\n\fthe measured integrated jet shapes, \u03a8(r/R), for jets with 37 < PTjet < 45 GeV,\ncompared to HERWIG, PYTHIA-Tune A, PYTHIA and PYTHIA-(no MPI)\npredictions. In addition, Figure 7(right) shows, for a fixed radius r0 = 0.3, the\naverage fraction of the jet transverse momentum outside r = r0 , 1 \u2212 \u03a8(r0 /R),\nas a function of PTjet where the points are located at the weighted mean in\neach PTjet range. The measurements show that the fraction of jet transverse\nmomentum at a given fixed r0 /R increases (1 \u2212 \u03a8(r0 /R) decreases) with PTjet ,\nindicating that the jets become narrower as PTjet increases. PYTHIA with default parameters produces jets systematically narrower than the data in the\nwhole region in PTjet . The contribution from secondary parton interactions between remnants to the predicted jet shapes (shown by the difference between\nPYTHIA and PYTHIA-(no MPI) predictions) is relatively small and decreases\nas PTjet increases. PYTHIA-Tune A predictions describe all of the data well.\nHERWIG predictions describe the measured jet shapes well for PTjet > 55 GeV\nbut produces jets that are too narrow at lower PTjet . Figure 8(left) shows the\n\nFigure 8: The measured integrated jet shape compared to the predictions of\nPYTHIA-Tune A and the separated contributions from quark- and gluon-jets.\nmeasured integrated jet shapes, \u03a8(r/R), for jets with 37 < PTjet < 45 GeV,\ncompared to PYTHIA-Tune A and the predictions for quark- and gluon-jets2\nseparately. Figure 8(right) shows the measured 1 \u2212 \u03a8(r0 /R), r0 = 0.3, as a\nfunction of PTjet . The Monte Carlo predictions indicate that the measured jet\nshapes are dominated by contributions from gluon-initiated jets at low PTjet\nwhile contributions from quark-initiated jets become important at high PTjet .\n2\n\nEach hadron-level jet from PYTHIA is classified as a quark- or gluon-jet by\nmatching (y \u2212 \u03c6 plane) its directions with that of one of the outgoing partons\nfrom the hard interaction.\n\n\fThis can be explained in terms of the different partonic contents in the proton\nand antiproton in the low- and high-PTjet regions, since the mixture of gluonand quark-jet in the final state partially reflects the nature of the incoming\npartons that participate in the hard interaction. For a given type of parton-jet\nin the Monte Carlo (quark- or gluon-jet), the observed trend with PTjet shows\nthe running of the strong coupling constant, \u03b1s (PTjet ). Jet shape measurements thus introduce strong constrains on phenomenological models describing\nsoft-gluon radiation and the underlying event in hadron-hadron interactions.\nSimilar studies with b-tagged jets will be necessary to test our knowledge of\nb-quark jet fragmentation processes in hadronic interactions, which is essential\nfor future precise Top and Higgs measurements.\n5\n\n\u2206\u03c6dijet Decorrelations\n\nThe D0 experiment has employed the dijet sample to study azimuthal decorrelations, \u2206\u03c6dijet , between the two leading jets. The normalized cross section:\n1\n\nd\u03c3\n\u03c3dijet d\u2206\u03c6dijet\n\n(3)\n\nis sensitive to the spectrum of the gluon radiation in the event. The measurements has been performed in different regions of the leading jet PTjet starting\nat PTjet > 75 GeV and the second jet is requied to have at least PTjet > 40 GeV.\n\nFigure 9: Measured azimuthal decorrelations in dijet production for central jets\ncompared to pQCD predictions in different regions of PTjet of the leading jet.\nFigure 9 shows the measured cross section compared to LO and NLO\npredictions from NLOJET++ program 8) . The LO predictions, with at most\n\n\fthree partons in the final state, is limited to \u2206\u03c6dijet > 2\u03c0/3, for which the\nthree partons define a Mercedes-star topology. It presents a prominent peak\nat \u2206\u03c6dijet = \u03c6 corresponding to the soft limit for which the third parton is\ncollinear to the direction of the two leading partons. The NLO predictions,\nwith four partons in the final state, describes the measured \u2206\u03c6dijet distribution except at very high and very low values of \u2206\u03c6dijet where additional soft\nconstributions, corresponding to a resummed calculation, are necessary. A reasonable approximation to such calculations is provided by parton shower Monte\nCarlo programs.\n\nFigure 10: Measured azimuthal decorrelations in dijet production for central jets\ncompared to PYTHIA and HERWIG predictions in different regions of leading\nPTjet .\nFigure 10 presents the measured cross section compared to PYTHIA-Tune\nA, PYTHIA and HERWIG predictions in different regions of PTjet . PYTHIA\nwith default parameters underestimates the gluon radiation at large angles.\nPYTHIA-Tune A predictions, which include an enhanced contribution from\ninitial-state soft gluon radiation and secondary parton interactions, describe\nthe azimuthal distribution. HERWIG also describes the data although tends\nto produce less radiation than PYTHIA-Tune A close to the direction of the\nleading jets.\n6\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBoth CDF and D0/ experiments have carried out measurements of the inclusive jet production cross section in Run II at the Tevatron using different jet\nalgorithms. The measurements are in agreement with pQCD NLO predictions.\nDedicated studies of the underlying event, jet shapes and azimuthal decorrela-\n\n\ftions in dijet final states allowed to establish the validity of the Monte Carlo\nmodels used to describe the soft-gluon contributions in the final state.\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI thank the organizers for their kind invitation to the conference and for the\nexciting program of talks and discussions they made possible.\nReferences\n1.
