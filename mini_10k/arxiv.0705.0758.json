This\nhypothesis gives rise to the equivalence problem, namely\nthe problem of deciding whether two spacetime metrics\nare different or are transformable one to another by a\ncoordinate transformation. In other words, given two\nsolutions of the field's equations, how to know whether\nthey describe the same gravitational field? Furthermore,\nit can be difficult from a given metric to distinguish between real physical effects and those which depend only\non the choice of coordinates. That is, the related question\nof how to decide whether certain effects have a physical\norigin or are due to the coordinate system used? A solution of the equivalence problem provides a complete and\ninvariant characterization of the spacetime local geometry from which the answers to these questions can be\nobtained.\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the solution to\nthe equivalence problem of n-dimensional Riemannian\nmanifolds goes back to Christoffel [1] and the best approach was developed by Cartan [2], which requires a\ncomparison of curvature tensor components and their\nfirst n(n+1)/2 covariant derivatives. The development of\ncomputer algebra opened the way to the formulation of\na procedure for testing equivalence of four-dimensional\nspacetimes in practice, that is, the Karlhede classification [3, 4]. Finally, algorithms using both the NewmanPenrose spinor formalism and the algebraic classification\nof the irreducible parts of the curvature spinor were developed, enabling the implementation of the practical procedure in a computer algebra suite called classi [5, 6],\nbased on the computer algebra system for General Rela-\n\n\u2217 fcsousa@fisica.ufpb.br\n\u2020 jfonseca@fisica.ufpb.br\n\u2021 cromero@fisca.ufpb.br\n\ntivity sheep [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. For a review on the equivalence problem see [11, 12, 13] and the references therein.\nIt should be mentioned that, in order to deal with torsion, the equivalence problem techniques were generalized to Riemann-Cartan spacetimes [14, 15] and implemented in a suite of computer algebra programs called\ntclassi [15, 16, 17], which is also based on sheep.\nIn this paper we present a solution to the equivalence\nproblem of three-dimensional spacetimes and give a practical method to obtain a coordinate invariant description\nof local geometry, which is presented by using spinor formalism. The method requires a nontrivial adaptation of\nKarlhede's invariant classification of spacetimes of general relativity.\nIn the next section, we present a review Cartan's solution to the equivalence problem. In section 3, Kalhede's\ninvariant classification of spacetimes is presented. In section 4,we present a brief review of the formalism of twocomponent real spinors in three-dimensional spacetimes\nincluding the curvature and the Cotton-York spinors, as\nwell as the Ricci and Bianchi identities. In section 5,\nwe show the algebraic classifications of the Ricci and\nCotton-York spinors, including their canonical forms and\nisotropy groups, by using the spinor formalism. In section 6, we obtain a minimal set of components of the n-th\nderivatives of the Riemannian curvature spinor such that\nall derivatives of a given order m can be expressed algebraically (using sums, products and contractions) in\nterms of these sets for n \u2264 m. This new result given\nhere for three-dimensional spacetimes is analogous to the\nresult obtained by MacCallum and \u00c5man [18] for fourdimensional spacetimes. In section 7, three-dimensional\nG\u00f6del-type spacetimes are examined by using the equivalence problem techniques. The conditions for local space\nand time homogeneity are derived and the equivalence\nof three-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetimes is studied.\nAn invariant classification is obtained and the results\nare compared with previous works on four-dimensional\nG\u00f6del-type spacetimes. Finally, in section 8 we present\nsome conclusions.\n\n\f2\n2.\n\nlating the exterior derivatives\n\nCARTAN'S SOLUTION\n\nIn this section we review Cartan's solution to the\nequivalence problem, applied to pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifolds. The result is presented for n-dimensional\nmanifolds. This is a very general result, since it is obtained for an arbitrary manifold without the use of any\ngravitational field's equations.\nThe (local) gravitational field in general relativity is\ncompletely determined by the components g\u03bc\u03bd of the\nmetric tensor in a given coordinate system, which are\na solution of Einstein's equations. Therefore, within\nthe context of general relativity, (local) equivalence of\nspacetimes means (local) isometry of pseudo-Riemannian\nspacetimes.\nIn a more formal way, we say that two n-dimensional\nf, are (locally) equivalent when there\nspacetimes M e M\ne between two coexists a diffeomorphism f : U 7\u2192 U\ne , x\u0303), where U \u2282 M and\nordinate systems (U, x) and (U\nf, respectively,\ne \u2282 M\u0303 are open sets defined on M and M\nU\nsuch that x\u0303 = f (x) and\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (x\u0303) =\n\n\u2202x\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2\ng\u03b1\u03b2 (x),\n\u2202 x\u0303\u03bc \u2202 x\u0303\u03bd\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere g\u03b1\u03b2 (x) and g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (x\u0303) are the components of the metf with respect to the coordinate systems\nrics on M and M\ne\n(U, x) and (U , x\u0303), respectively.\nDespite the intuitive meaning of the equivalence definition given by eq. (2.1), its reformulation in terms of\ndifferential 1-forms is mostly desirable, taking into account Cartan's method to determine the equivalence of\nsets of 1-forms. Let \u03c9 a = \u03c9 a\u03bc dx\u03bc and \u03c9\u0303 a = \u03c9\u0303 a\u03bc dx\u0303\u03bc be\nnon-holonomic coframes uniquely defined in coordinates\ne , x\u0303) on n-dimensional manifolds M\nsystems (U, x) and (U\nf\nand M , respectively. We say that these sets of linearly independent 1-forms are equivalent when there exists a coordinate transformation x\u03bc = x\u03bc (x\u0303) such that \u03c9\u0303 a = \u03c9 a .\nCartan [2] showed that these non-holonomic coframes are\nequivalent if, and only if, the system of algebraic equations obtained by the comparison of the non-holonomic\nobjects C apq and C\u0303 apq and their covariant derivatives according to\ne a (x\u0303) = C a (x),\nC\npq\npq\n\na\nea\nC\npq;m1 (x\u0303) = C pq;m1 (x),\n..\n.\na\nea\nC\npq;m1 ...m(p+1) (x\u0303) = C pq;m1 ...m(p+1) (x),\n\n(2.2)\n\nis compatible, that is, there exists a solution x\u03bc = x\u03bc (x\u0303).\nHere, and in what follows, the covariant derivative is denoted by a semi-colon.\nThe non-holonomic objects and their covariant derivatives at each member of eqs. (2.2) are obtained by calcu-\n\n1 a\nC \u03c9p \u2227 \u03c9q ,\n2 pq\n= C apq;m \u03c9 m ,\n= C apq;mn \u03c9 n\n\nd\u03c9 a =\ndC apq\ndC apq;m\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\nand successively.\nThe covariant derivative of order p + 1 is the lowest order derivative which is\nfunctionally dependent on the elements of the set\n{C apq , C apq;m1 , * * * , C apq;m1 ...mp }, given by all lower\nderivatives up to order p. That is, the p + 1 derivative\nis expressible in terms of its predecessors. Since each\nderivative either gives (at least) one new functionally independent function or is the last we need to consider, we\nobtain the limit (p + 1) \u2264 n, taking into account that\nthere exist at most n functionally independent functions\non an n-dimensional manifold.\nThe most appropriate context to deal with the equivalence problem according to Cartan's method is the bundle F (M ) of generalized orthogonal frames defined over\na pseudo-Riemannian manifold M . The frame bundle\nF (M ) is a differentiable manifold whose points are given\nby a pair: a point p of M and a generalized orthogonal frameSdefined on p. That is, a manifold given by\nF (M ) = p\u2208M Fp , where Fp is the set of all generalized\northogonal frames defined at p \u2208 M , called the fiber over\np. These frames are given by the linearly independent\nvector fields ha = ha\u03bc (x)\u2202\u03bc (a = 1, . . . , n), where the\ncomponents of the metric \u03b7ab = g(ha , hb ) = g\u03bc\u03bd ha\u03bc hb\u03bd\nare constant and given by a symmetric matrix \u03b7 = (\u03b7ab ),\nwith the appropriate signature [6].\nThe generalized orthogonal frames cannot be used\nto define equivalence, since they are not uniquely defined. There exist linear transformations ha 7\u2192 \u039bab hb\nwhich leave invariant the components of the metric \u03b7ab =\n\u039bac \u03b7cd \u039bbd . These transformations are called generalized\nrotations and form the group O(n) with 12 n(n \u2212 1) parameters [6, 19, 20].\nUnderlying Cartans approach to solve the equivalence\nproblem there is the fact that equivalent n-dimensional\npseudo-Riemannian spacetimes M and M\u0303 have equivalent bundles of generalized orthogonal frames F (M )\nand F (M\u0303 ), respectively. Locally, F (M ) is the product\nU \u00d7 O(n) of the subset U \u2208 M and the generalized orthogonal group O(n). The fiber Fp over a point p of U\nis isomorphic to the generalized orthogonal group O(n),\nsince it is the set of all generalized orthogonal frames\ndefined at p, which are related by generalized orthogonal transformations. Thus, the coordinates of F (M ) are\ngiven by the n coordinates x = (xa ) of the point p and\nthe n(n + 1)/2 coordinates (parameters) \u03be = (\u03be A ) of the\ngeneralized orthogonal group O(n).\nThe crucial point for Cartans approach is the requirement of a set of uniquely defined linearly independent 1forms. Since the freedom in the choice of generalized orthogonal frames in M is lost in F (M ), there is a uniquelydefined basis of the cotangent space T P\u2217 (F (M )), given by\nboth the canonical 1-form \u0398A = H A\u03bc (x, \u03be)dx\u03bc and the\n\n\f3\nconnection 1-form \u03a3AB = \u0393AB\u03bc (x, \u03be)dx\u03bc + \u0393AB\u03be (x, \u03be)d\u03be A\nof F (M ). Therefore, we can reformulate the definition\nof (local) equivalence given by eq. (2.1) in the following\nf be two nway [1, 4, 6, 21, 22, 23]. Let M and M\ndimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and F (M ) e\nf) the fiber bundles of generalized orthogonal frames\nFe (M\nf, respectively. We say that M and M\nf are\nover M and M\n(locally) equivalent when there exists a local diffeomorf) such that\nphism J : F (M ) 7\u2192 Fe(M\ne A = \u0398A and J \u2217 \u03a3\ne AB = \u03a3AB\nJ \u2217\u0398\n\n(2.6)\n\nhold. Here J \u2217 is the pull-back map defined from J.\nA solution to the equivalence problem for pseudoRiemannian manifolds can then be obtained by using\nCartans result on the equivalence of sets of 1-forms together with Cartan's equations of structure for a pseudoRiemannian manifold. The solution can be summarized\nas follows [1, 4, 6, 21, 22, 23]. Two n-dimensional pseudoRiemann manifolds M and M\u0303 are locally equivalent if\nand only if there exists a local diffeomorphism J between\ntheir corresponding generalized orthogonal frame bundles\nF (M ) and F (M\u0303 ), such that the following system of algebraic equations relating the components of the curvature\ntensor and its covariant derivatives\neA\nRABCD = R\nBCD ,\nA\nA\ne\n= R\nR\n\nBCD;M1\n\nBCD;M1\n\n,\n\n..\n.\n\nRABCD;M1 ...Mp+1\n\n=\n\neABCD;M ...M\nR\n1\np+1\n\n(2.7)\n,\n\nare compatible as equations in \u0001generalized orthogonal\nframe bundle coordinates xa , \u03be A . The (p+1)-th derivative of curvature is the lowest derivatives which is functionally dependent on all the previous derivatives. The\nnumber of functionally independent functions is at most\nthe dimension of F (M ). Since there is at least one new\nfunctionally independent function at each order of derivative, it follows that p + 1 \u2264 n(n + 1)/2.\nIn association with the necessary and sufficient conditions for (local) equivalence given by eqs. (2.7), Cartan's\nsolution also shows that all (local) metric properties of\nan arbitrary n-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold\nare described in a comprehensive and unique way by the\nset\nIp =\n\n{RABCD\n\n, RABCD;M1\n\n, . . . , RABCD;M1 ...Mp },\n\nin a given coordinate system. There are several results\nwhere the Cartan's invariants are used to investigate (local) properties of spacetimes. In the context of General\nRelativity we have, for instance, the determination of the\nspacetime isometry group [24, 25], the investigation of\nlimits of families of spacetimes [26] and the local degrees\nof freedom on a spacetime [27].\nConcluding this section we review the results where\nthe dimensions of the isometry group and its isotropy\nsubgroup are obtained from Cartan's invariants.\nWe say that a vector field with components v \u03b1 in a\ngiven coordinate system, defines a local isometry on a\npseudo-Riemannian manifold M if, and only if, the following conditions are satisfied:\n\u00a3v g\u03bc\u03bd = v\u03bc;\u03bd + v\u03bd;\u03bc = 0 .\n\nThe eq. (2.9) above are called Killing's equations and\ntheir solutions are Killing vector fields. They are the\ngenerators of the isometry group and the maximal number of linearly independent Killing vectors is the dimension of the isometry group. There is an isotropy subgroup\nwhen there exist Killing vector fields which generate oneparameter groups of transformations which leave invariant the points of the spacetime manifold. They are the\ngenerators of the isotropy subgroup.\nAccording to Cartan's solution to the equivalence\nproblem, we can say that for each (local) isometry of\na manifold M there exits, in bijective correspondence,\na diffeomorphism on the bundle of generalized orthogonal frames F (M ) which preserve the set Ip of Cartan's\ninvariants. Therefore, when Ip has kp functionally independent Cartan's invariants, then the system of algebraic\nequations eqs. (2.7) has kp linearly independent equations\nand its solution is a diffeomorphism on the frame bundle\nF (M ) which depends on 12 n(n + 1) \u2212 kp arbitrary constants. Dealing separately with the tp functions of the\nspacetime coordinates (x\u03bc ) and the mp = kp \u2212 tp functions of the parameters (\u03be A ) of the generalized orthogonal group O(n), it can be shown that [2, 3] there exists\nan isometry group of dimension r, with an isotropy subgroup of dimension s and acting on a orbit of dimension\nd, where\n1\nn(n \u2212 1) \u2212 mp ,\n2\n1\nr = n(n + 1) \u2212 kp = s + n \u2212 tp ,\n2\nd = r \u2212 s = n \u2212 tp .\ns =\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhose elements are called Cartan's invariants, since they\nare invariant under coordinate transformations on the\nbase manifold. But they depend on the orientation of the\nframe and change under generalized orthogonal rotations.\nThe theoretical upper bound for the number of covariant\nderivatives to be calculated is n(n + 1)/2.\nIn principle, we can use the set Ip of Cartan's invariants to obtain all (local) properties of a spacetime that\ncan be obtained from the components g\u03bc\u03bd of the metric\n\n(2.9)\n\n3.\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n(2.12)\n\nKARLHEDE CLASSIFICATION\n\nIn this section we show how the difficulties to deal with\nCartan's solution of the equivalence problem in practice\nare considerably reduced by a procedure to test equivalence, based on an algorithm developed by Karlhede,\nwhere all calculations are performed on the spacetime\n\n\f4\nbase manifold and the maximal order of the derivatives\nis reduced [3].\nCartan's solution of the equivalence problem has an\nimportant aspect to be considered in practice. At each\norder q = 0, 1, . . . , (p + 1) of derivative of the curvature\ntensor, there are several properties which can be determined. Their comparison constitute necessary conditions\nto test the equivalence and can be used at each order q to\nestablish a practical procedure. The test finishes whenever one of these conditions is not satisfied. Only when\nall necessary conditions for all orders q = 0, 1, . . . , (p + 1)\nof derivatives are satisfied it is necessary to verify the\nconsistency of the system of algebraic equations given by\neqs. (2.7), that is, the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor equivalence. The relevance of this approach is evident from the practical point of view when considering\nthat there is no procure which makes formally decidable\nthe problem of verifying whether or not a system of algebraic equations has a solution [10].\nFollowing this approach, we will describe the steps\nneeded in order to present Karlhede's algorithm to test\nthe equivalence. Initially it is necessary to handle separately the spacetime manifold coordinates x\u03bc and the\nparameters \u03be A of the generalized orthogonal group. This\nis done by calculating the Cartan's invariants in a section of the bundle of generalized orthogonal frames, that\nis, with respect to a given generalized orthogonal frame.\nTherefore, all Cartan's invariants are calculated on the\nbase spacetime manifold and no more depend on the parameters of the group of generalized rotations. Thus, now\nthe set\nIp = {Rabcd , . . . , Rabcd;m1 ...m(p+1) }\n\n(3.13)\n\nis given by the components Rabcd of the curvature on M\nand their covariant derivatives, with respect to the generalized orthogonal frame which define the local section\nof the frame bundle. Nevertheless, the dependence of\nCartan's invariants on the parameters \u03be A of the generalized orthogonal group still can be verified through their\nbehavior under generalized rotations.\nThe next step deals with the reduction, at each order\nof differentiation q = 0, 1, . . . , (p + 1), of the dimension of\nthe fiber bundle effectively used to test the equivalence.\nThis is achieved by choosing a generalized orthogonal\nframe which is aligned with invariant directions determined by Cartan's invariants. With this choice the freedom of generalized rotations is reduced and the frame is\nfixed as much as possible. These invariant directions are\ndetermined by the algebraic classifications of the Cartan's invariants, which define canonical forms for each\none of them. These generalized orthogonal frames are\ncalled standard or canonical frames [3]. This step has\ntwo important aspects from a practical point of view.\nFirst, along with the reduction of the dimension of the\neffective frame bundle the maximal order of derivatives\nis also reduced. Second, the algebraic classifications define a set of necessary conditions given by the algebraic\ntypes, their canonical forms and groups of isotropy.\n\nThe reduction of the dimension of the effective frame\nbundle at each order q = 0, 1, . . . , (p + 1) of derivatives,\ncan be determined from the isotropy group Hq of the set\nIq . This is the group of generalized rotations which leave\ninvariant the canonical forms of the elements of Iq . Thus,\nwhen two spacetimes have the same isotropy group Hq ,\nthe number of functionally independent functions of the\nparameters \u03be A are the same as well [6]. Therefore, the\nfreedom of generalized rotations of the canonical frame\nis reduced each time the dimension of Hq is less than the\ndimension of H(q\u22121) . Since Hq is a subgroup of H(q\u22121) ,\nthe parameters of the generalized rotations which do not\nbelong to Hq can be used to fix furthermore the canonical\nframe.\nThe next step take into account the fact that local equivalence also requires that the Cartan's invariants have the same dependence on the coordinates x\u03bc\nof the spacetime manifold. Thus, at each order q =\n0, 1, . . . , (p + 1) of derivative it is necessary that equivalent spacetime manifolds have the same numbers tq of\nfunctionally independent functions of the coordinates x\u03bc\nin the elements of Iq .\nFinally, according to Cartan's solution of the problem\nof equivalence, the Cartan's invariants must be calculated\nuntil a order q = (p+1) of derivatives where the elements\nof I(p+1) are functionally dependent on the elements of\nIp . Therefore, the steps of the practical procedure finish\nat an order q of derivative where not only the groups\nH(q+1) and Hq are the same, but also the numbers t(p+1)\nand tp . The last step is to check the occurrence of these\nequalities.\nAll the steps of the practical procedure discussed above\ncan be joined in an algorithm which starts by setting\nq = 0 and has the following steps [3]:\n1. Calculate the set Iq , i.e., the derivatives of the curvature up to the q-th order.\n2. Fix the frame, as much as possible, by putting the\nelements of Iq into canonical forms.\n3. Find the frame freedom given by the isotropy group\nHq of transformations which leave invariant the\ncanonical forms of Iq .\n4. Find the number tq of functionally independent\nfunctions of spacetime coordinates in the elements\nof Iq , brought into the canonical forms.\n5. If the isotropy group Hq is the same as H(q\u22121) and\nthe number of functionally independent functions\ntq is equal to t(q\u22121) , then let q = p + 1 and stop.\nOtherwise, increment q by 1 and go to step 1.\nThis procedure provides a discrete characterization of ndimensional pseudo-Riemannian spacetimes, called Karlhede classification, in terms of the following properties:\nthe set of canonical forms in Ip , the isotropy groups\n{H0 , . . . , Hp } and the number of independent functions\n{t0 , . . . , tp }.\n\n\f5\nTo check the equivalence of two pseudo-Riemannian\nspacetimes the above discrete properties of their Karlhede's classifications are compared and only when they\nmatch is it necessary to determine the compatibility of\neqs.(2.7).\nAn important result obtained with the application of\nKarlhede algorithm is the reduction of the maximal order\nof derivatives, given by n(n + 1)/2 according to Cartan's\ntheorem.\nIn the context of General Relativity, we have fourdimensional pseudo-Riemannian spacetimes. The canonical frame is fixed through the principal directions of\nthe Weyl tensor, obtained by the Petrov's classification. Since the isotropy groups os the Petrov types\n(except type 0) have dimension s \u2264 2, we obtain the\nlimit (p + 1) \u2264 7. For conformally flat spacetimes, the\nWeyl tensor vanish (Petrov type 0) and the principal directions of the Ricci tensor are used instead. As the\nisotropy groups of the Segre types (except Segre 0) of\nthe Ricci tensor have dimensions s \u2264 3, we obtain the\nlimit p + 1 \u2264 8 [10].\nFor three-dimensional spacetimes, the Weyl tensor\nvanishes identically and the canonical frame is aligned\nwith the principal directions of the Ricci tensor. Now\nthe Segre types (except type 0) have isotropy groups of\ndimensions s \u2264 1, and we find the limit p + 1 \u2264 5.\nThe Karlhede algorithm was implemented by using\nspinor formalism to deal with equivalence in General\nRelativity, since it enables symmetries which are complicated in tensorial form to be expressed in a simple\nway. Since the same simplifications occurs with respect\nto spinors in three-dimensional spacetimes, in the next\nsection we briefly present the two-component real spinors\nin three-dimensional spacetimes and obtain some results\nrequired to implement the Karlhede algorithm.\n4.\n\nTWO-COMPONENT REAL SPINORS\n\nthe spin frame {oA , \u03b9A } is normalized by oA \u03b9A = 1, where\noA = (1, 0) and \u03b9A = (0, 1).\nThe 2-order symmetric real spinors \u03c6AB corresponds\nto vectors in three-dimensional spacetime M . There is\na correspondence between a null frame of real vectors\n{k a , ma , na } ( or a Lorentz frame {ta , xa , z a } ) in M and a\nspin frame {oA , \u03b9A } given through the real and symmetric\nconnecting quantities \u03c3 aAB according to\n\u221a\nk a = (ta + z a )/ 2 = \u03c3 aAB oA oB = \u03c3 a00 ,\n\u221a\nna = (ta \u2212 z a )/ 2 = \u03c3 aAB \u03b9A \u03b9B = \u03c3 a11 ,\n(4.15)\n\u221a a\n\u221a\na\na\na\nA B\nB A\nm = x = \u03c3 AB (o \u03b9 + o \u03b9 )/ 2 = 2 \u03c301 ,\nwhere ma = xa and z a are space-like, ta is time-like,\nk a and na are light-like. The correspondence between\nthe spaces also requires the correspondence between their\ninner products\n\u03c3aAB \u03c3bCD gABCD\n\u2212ka nb \u2212 kb na + ma mb\n\u2212ta tb + za zb + xa xb ,\n\u03c3 aAB \u03c3 bCD gab\n1\n= \u2212 (\u01ebAC \u01ebBD + \u01ebAD \u01ebBC ).\n2\n\ngab =\n=\n=\ngABCD =\n\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\nNow we can show that, corresponding to the normalization oA \u03b9A = 1 of the spin frame, we have\nka na = ta ta = \u22121, ma ma = xa xa = za z a = 1, (4.18)\nwith all other contractions vanishing identically. In general, an arbitrary vector v a in the null frame eqs. (4.15)\nabove corresponds to a symmetric real spinor \u03c6AB according to\nv a = \u03c3 aAB \u03c6AB , \u03c6AB = \u2212\u03c3aAB v a .\n\n(4.19)\n\nNow, taking into account eqs. (4.16)-(4.17), we obtain\nWe shall consider three-dimensional spacetimes described by a metric with signature (\u2212++). In this section\nwe present some results obtained by using the formalism of two-component real spinors [28, 29, 30], which is\nanalogous to the Newman-Penrose [19, 31, 32] formalism\nof two-component complex spinors in four-dimensional\nspacetimes. It should be mention that only one type\nof spinor index is required for three-dimensional space.\nThe spin transformation are the elements of the group\nSU (1, 1) for two-component complex spinors and the\ngroup SL(2, R) for two-component real spinors [28, 30].\nAn one-index spinor will be denoted by \u03c8 A or \u03c8A and\nhas two real components, where capital latin indices take\nthe values 0, 1. These indices will be raised and lowered\nby the Levi-Civita symbol \u01ebAB = \u2212\u01ebBA ( \u01eb01 = 1), according to\n\u03c8A = \u03c8 B \u01ebBA , \u03c8 A = \u01ebAB \u03c8B .\n\n(4.14)\n\nThe inner product is given by \u03c8 A \u03c6A = \u01ebAB \u03c8B \u03c6A and\n\nva v a = gab v b v a = gABCD \u03c6CD \u03c6AB = \u2212\u03c6AB \u03c6AB . (4.20)\nThe spinor \u01ebAB fulfills the identity\n\u01ebA[B \u01ebCD] = 0,\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere square parentheses denote skew symmetrization.\nOne consequence of the identity eq. (4.21) above is the\nidentity\n\u03c6A \u03c8B \u2212 \u03c6B \u03c8A = \u01ebAB \u03c6N \u03c8 N ,\n\n(4.22)\n\nfor any spinors \u03c6A and \u03c8A , which will be used repeatedly\nto obtain the decomposition into irreducible parts of the\ncurvature spinor.\nFor three-dimensional spacetimes the Weyl tensor vanishes identically and the Riemannian curvature tensor\ncan be decomposed in terms of the Ricci tensor Rab =\nRcacb and the scalar of curvature R. Using the traceless\n\n\f6\nRicci tensor Sab = Rab \u2212 31 gab R, the Riemann tensor is\ngiven by [33]\nRabcd = gac Sbd \u2212 gad Sbc + gbd Sac \u2212 gbc Sad\n1\n\u2212 (gad gbc \u2212 gac gbd )R.\n(4.23)\n6\nand we can calculate the curvature spinor which, by using the identity eq. (4.22), is decomposed into irreducible\nparts in accordance with\nRAXBY CZDW = \u01ebXY RABCZDW\n+\u01ebAB RXY CZDW ,\nRABCZDW = \u01ebZW QABCD\n+\u01ebCD QABZW ,\n1\nQABCD = \u03a6ABCD \u2212 gABCD \u039b.\n3\n\n(4.24)\n(4.25)\n(4.26)\n\nTherefore, the irreducible parts of the three-dimensional\ncurvature spinor are the totally symmetric spinor\nSABCD = 2\u03a6ABCD , which corresponds to the traceless\nRicci tensor Sab , and the curvature scalar \u039b = R. For\nthe Ricci tensor Rab we obtain the spinor\n1\nRABCD = 2 \u03a6ABCD + gABCD \u039b.\n3\n\n(4.27)\n\nSimilar results have been obtained in [29], but with a\ndifferent signature of the metric (+ \u2212 \u2212) and a different choice of \u039b in order to resemble the results for fourdimensional spacetimes.\nNow we can express the Ricci spinor \u03a6ABCD using the\nfollowing abbreviations for the null frame components of\nthe traceless Ricci tensor Sab . We define a real symmetric\n\u03a6AB (A, B = 0, 1, 2) by\n1\n1\nSab k a k b = Rab k a k b , (4.28)\n2\n2\n1\n1\na b\n= Sab n n = Rab na nb , (4.29)\n2\n2\n1 1\na b\n= \u221a ( Sab m k )\n2 2\n\n\u03a600 := \u03a60000 =\n\u03a622 := \u03a61111\n\u03a610 := \u03a61000\n\n\u03a612\n\n\u03a611\n\n1 1\n= \u221a ( Rab ma k b ),\n2 2\n1 1\n:= \u03a61011 = \u221a ( Sab ma nb )\n2 2\n1 1\n= \u221a ( Rab ma nb ),\n2 2\n1\n:= \u03a60011 = Sab k a nb\n2\n1\n= (Rab ma mb + Rab na k b ).\n6\n\n(4.30)\n\n(4.31)\n\n(4.32)\n\nNote that \u03a6AB has only five independent components,\nsince we have the identity \u03a611 \u2261 \u03a602 due to S = S aa =\n\u22122Sab na k b + Sab ma mb = 0 (this point is missing in [29]).\nWhen na and k a are swapped, the index 1 in \u03a6AB remains unchanged, while the rest flip 0 \u2194 2. It should be\n\nmentioned that we follow Penrose-Rindler [31] and use\nthe analogous identification between \u03a6AB and \u03a6ABCD ,\nwhich is different from the choice used in [29].\nConcluding, we present the Lorentz transformations\nperformed in the null frame {k a , ma , na } are given by\n[34, 35] boosts\n\u00f1a =\n\n\u221a\n1\nA na , k\u0303 a = \u221a k a , m\u0303a = ma ,\nA\n\n(4.33)\n\nwhere A > 0, null rotations which leave na invariant\n1\nk\u0303 a = k a + B ma + B 2 na , m\u0303a = ma + B na ,\n2\n\n(4.34)\n\nand null rotations which leave k a invariant, given by\neqs. (4.34) with na in place of k a and conversely and a\nnew parameter C replacing B, where B, C \u2208 R. These\ntransformations leave the components eqs. (4.16) of the\nmetric invariant. The Lorentz group SO(2, 1) has three\nparameters.\nIn the next section, as required by the Kalhede classification, we review the algebraic classification of the Ricci\nand Cotton-York tensors in terms of Segre types, and obtain their canonical forms and the correspondent isotropy\ngroups using the two-component real spinor formalism.\n5.\n\nALGEBRAIC CLASSIFICATION\n\nThe algebraic classification of the Ricci tensor in threedimensional manifolds can be obtained by using a null\ntriad and the freedom of Lorentz transformations in order to simplifying as much as possible their non-vanishing\ncomponents [34, 35]. Thus, through Lorentz transformations it is possible to choose a null frame {k a , ma , na },\nwhere k a na = \u22121 and ma ma = 1, such that the Ricci\ntensor takes one of the following canonical forms:\nSegre type\nCanonical form\n[11, 1] Rab = \u22122 \u03b1 k(a nb) \u2212 \u03b2(ka kb + na nb )\n+ \u03b3 ma mb\n(5.35)\n[(11), 1] Rab = \u03b3 gab\n+(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1) (ka + na )(kb + nb ) (5.36)\n[1(1, 1)] Rab = \u03b1 gab + (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1) ma mb\n(5.37)\n[(11, 1)] Rab = \u03b1 gab\n(5.38)\n[1z z\u0304] Rab = \u22122\u03b1 k(a nb) \u2212 \u03b2(ka kb \u2212 na nb )\n+ \u03b3 ma mb\n(5.39)\n[12] Rab = \u22122\u03b1 k(a nb) + \u03bbka kb\n+ \u03b3 ma mb\n(5.40)\n[(12)] Rab = \u03b1 gab + \u03bbka kb\n(5.41)\n[3] Rab = \u03b1 gab + \u03bc(ka mb + ma kb ) (5.42)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 R and \u03b2 6= 0 in eq. (5.39). It is possible\nto choose \u03bb = \u00b11 and \u03bc = \u00b11. Note that the curvature\nscalar is given by R = 2 \u03b1 + \u03b3, except for Segre types\n[(11,1)], [(12)] and [3] where R = 3 \u03b1.\n\n\f7\nThe above canonical forms correspond to the algebraic\nclassification of Rab in terms of Segre types [1z z\u0304], [12],\n[3] and [11,1], obtained through the solution of the eigenvalue problem\n(Rab \u2212 \u03bbg ab )v b = 0,\n\n(5.43)\n\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 C.\nTherefore, the canonical forms of the Ricci tensor\ndetermine null frames {ma , na , k a }, whose vectors are\naligned with the principal directions of the Ricci tensor. These are the canonical frames of Karlhede procedure. They are not uniquely determined, since the Segre\ntypes and their degeneracies have isotropy groups whose\nelements are the Lorentz transformations which leave invariant the canonical forms.\nBy using the quantities defined by eqs.(4.28)\u2013(4.32)\nand the canonical forms given by eqs.(5.35)\u2013(5.42), we\ncan obtain the following canonical forms and isotropy\ngroups of the Segre types of the Ricci spinor, given in\nterms of the non vanishing \u03a6AB :\nSegre type Canonical form\n[11, 1] \u03a600 = \u03a622 , \u03a611\n[(11), 1] \u03a600 = \u03a622 = 3 \u03a611\n[1(1, 1)]\n\u03a611\n[(11, 1)]\n\u03a6AB = 0\n[1z z\u0304] \u03a600 = \u2212\u03a622 , \u03a611\n[12]\n\u03a622 = 1, \u03a611\n[(12)]\n\u03a622 = 1\n[3]\n\u03a612 = 1\n\nIsotropy group\nnone\n(5.44)\nSO(2)\n(5.45)\nSO(1, 1)\n(5.46)\nSO(2, 1)\n(5.47)\nnone\n(5.48)\nnone\n(5.49)\nn.rot.(ka inv) (5.50)\nnone\n(5.51)\n\nFor Segre types [11,1] and [1z z\u0304] the quantity \u03a611 can be\nzero.\nThe Segre type [1z z\u0304], which is the only case to admit\nnon-real eigenvalues, has three eigenvectors, two complex\nconjugate k a \u00b1 ina and one space-like ma , with eigenvalues \u03b1 \u00b1 i\u03b2 (\u03b2 6= 0) and \u03b3, respectively. The Segre type\n[12] has two eigenvectors, a null k a and a space-like ma ,\nwith eigenvalues \u03b1 and \u03b3, respectively. The Segre type\n[3] has one null eigenvector k a with eigenvalue \u03b1 [34, 35].\nFor Segre type [11, 1]\u221athe eigenvectors forms\n\u221a a Lorentz\nframe ta = (k a + na )/ 2, z a = (k a \u2212 na )/ 2 and xa =\nma , whose eigenvalues are \u03b4 = \u03b1 + \u03b2, \u03c1 = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 and \u03b3,\nrespectively. This is the only Segre type with time-like\neigenvector. Therefore, it is possible to choose a Lorentz\nframe {ta , xa , z a } where the Segre type [11, 1] is given by\nthe alternate form [34, 35]\nRab = \u2212\u03b4ta tb + \u03c1za zb + \u03b3xa xb .\n\n(5.52)\n\nThe conformal properties of three-dimensional spacetime are described by the Cotton-York tensor [36]\nCab =\n\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212g \u03b5bcd \u2207c (Rda \u2212 g da R),\n4\n\n(5.53)\n\nwhere g = det(gab ) and \u03b5abc is the Levi-Civita symbol\nwith \u03b5012 = 1.

It also satisfies the following conditions\nCab = Cba , C aa = 0, \u2207b Cab = 0\n\n(5.54)\n\nof a symmetric, traceless, covariantly conserved tensor.\nSince the Cotton-York tensor Cab is symmetric and\ntraceless, we find that the Cotton-York spinor \u03a8ABCD\nhas the same symmetries as the Ricci spinor \u03a6ABCD .\nThus, it is classified through the same Segre types, with\nthe same canonical forms given in terms of the quantities\n\u03a8AB , which are defined exactly as \u03a6AB , i.e.,\n\u03a800 := \u03a80000 = Cab k a k b ,\n\u03a822 := \u03a81111 = Cab na nb ,\n1\n\u03a810 := \u03a81000 = \u221a Cab ma k b ,\n2\n1\n\u03a812 := \u03a81011 = \u221a Cab ma nb ,\n2\n\u03a811 := \u03a80011 = Cab k a nb .\n\n(5.55)\n(5.56)\n(5.57)\n(5.58)\n(5.59)\n(5.60)\n\nNote that not only the Segre type, but also the principal spinors of \u03a8ABCD , may be different from those of\n\u03a6ABCD .\nAt last we obtain a final result required in order to\nimplement the Karlhede procedure using the most efficient way. It is not necessary to calculate all Cartan's\ninvariants, since they are interrelated by both Bianchi\nand Ricci identities and their differential concomitants.\nIn the next section, we use the spinor formalism to tackle\nthe problem of specifying a minimal set of quantities to\nbe computed at each step of differentiation of the Karlhede algorithm.\n6.\n\nA COMPLETE MINIMAL SET OF N-TH\nCURVATURE DERIVATIVES\n\nThe first step of the Karlhede algorithm involve the\ncomputation of the covariant derivatives of the Riemann\ncurvature. For economy in the computations, it is useful\nto specify a minimal set of quantities to be computed\nat each step of differentiation and we will discuss this\nproblem here.\nThus, in this section Thus we wish to specify a minimal set of components of the spinor n-th derivatives of\nthe Riemannian curvature such that all derivatives of\na given order m can be expressed algebraically (using\nsums, products and contractions) in terms of these sets\nfor n \u2264 m.\nA relevant point to be taken into account when one\nneeds to compute covariant derivatives of the curvature\ntensor is that they are interrelated by both Bianchi and\nRicci identities and their differential concomitants.\nThe new result given here for three-dimensional spacetimes is the analogous to the result obtained by MacCallum and \u00c5man [18] for four-dimensional spacetimes.\nTheir result is given in terms of two-component complex\n\n\f8\nspinors and includes the Weyl spinor and its covariant\nderivatives. Here we use two-component real spinors but\nfollows the same approach.\nAlthough other minimal sets exist (and are related to\nour choice by the application of the Ricci and Bianchi\nidentities) the chosen set has two nice properties: it is\nrecursively defined (which avoids any need to compute\nadditional n-th derivative quantities in order to find the\nhigher derivatives) and contains only totally symmetric spinors (which simplifies storage and retrieval algorithms).\nBefore stating and proving the new result we review\nthe derivation of the number of algebraically independent\nquantities that must be given to specify the invariants\nformed from n-th derivatives of the Riemannian curvature of a general three-dimensional spacetime (which is\nwhat the spinor components in a canonical frame are).\nThis number is given by\n3\n(n + 4)(n + 1).\n2\n\n(6.61)\n\nThe above result is most easily seen by considering invariants formed from the coordinate components of the\n(n + 2)-th derivatives of the metric. Since partial derivatives commute, all such derivatives are expressible in\nterms of g(ab),(c1 ,c2 ,...,c(n+2) ) , where round brackets denote\nsymmetrisation. The number of these quantities can easily be computed by considering the partition of the indices in each symmetrisation between the three different\npossible values, giving\n6(n + 4)!\n= 3(n + 4)(n + 3).\n2!(n + 2)!\n\n(6.62)\n\nHowever, there are still the possible coordinate transformations to consider, specified by three functions whose\n(n + 3)-th derivatives contribute to the (n + 2)-th derivative of the metric. By a similar argument, there are\n3\n3(n + 5)!\n= (n + 5)(n + 4)\n2!(n + 3)!\n2\n\n(6.63)\n\ndistinct contributions arising in this way. The number of\nindependent quantities stated above is the difference of\neq. (6.63) and eq. (6.62).\nThe number of independent quantities is considerably\nless than the total number of components of the n-th\nderivative which is 6 \u00d7 3n . One can easily compute the\ncumulative total number of these independent quantities\nup to the n-th derivative, which is\n1\n(n + 6)(n + 2)(n + 1).\n2\n\n(6.64)\n\nFor n = 6 (the bound on p given by Cartan for d = 3) the\ncumulative total number of all components of the derivatives is 4374, whereas the number just derived is 336.\nSimilarly, for n = 5 (the upper bound on p for metrics\nof Segre types [(11),1], [1(1,1)] and [(12)]) the numbers\n\nare 1458 and 231. Therefore, it is necessary a computer\nalgebra implementation to carry out the calculations.\nTo end this part, we quote the spinor forms of the\nBianchi identities\n\u2207AB \u03a6ABCD +\n\n1\n\u2207CD \u039b = 0\n12\n\n(6.65)\n\nand the Ricci identities\n\u039b\n(\u01ebCA \u03c8B + \u01ebCB \u03c8A ).\n6\n(6.66)\nLet us define the set of n-th derivatives \u2207n R to contain\nthe following.\n\u2207N(A \u2207B)N \u03c8C = \u03a6ABCD \u03c8 D +\n\n(i) The totally symmetrised n-th covariant derivatives\nof the Ricci spinor:\n\u2207(AX \u2207BW . . . \u2207GZ \u03a6HKLM) .\n(ii) The totally symmetrised n-th covariant derivatives\nof the curvature scalar:\n\u2207(AX \u2207BW . . . \u2207GZ) \u039b.\n(iii) For n \u2265 1 the totally symmetrised (n \u2212 1)-th covariant derivative of the Cotton-York spinor:\n\u2207(AX \u2207BW . . . \u2207GZ \u03a8HKLM) .\n(iv) For n \u2265 2, the dAlembertian of all quantities in\n\u2207(n\u22122) R, i.e.,\n\u0003 Q \u2261 \u2207N N \u2207N N Q,\nwhere Q is a member of \u2207(n\u22122) R.\nThe new result for three-dimensional spacetimes is obtained by following the same reasoning used by MacCallum and \u00c5man [18], since we have similar relations between the quantities. Thus we have the following:\nTheorem. All n-th derivatives of the Riemann tensor\ncan be expressed algebraically in terms of the elements\nof \u2207r R for 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n and this is a minimal such set of\nderivatives.\nProof. For n = 0 the statement is merely the decomposition of the Riemannian curvature spinor and, for n \u2265 1\nthe n-th derivatives of the curvature spinor are given by\nthe n-th derivatives of the spinors \u03a6 and \u039b.\nFollowing MacCallum and \u00c5man, we use the notation\n\u223c for the equivalence relation that n-th derivatives are\nequal modulo algebraic expressions in the derivatives up\nto order (n \u2212 1). The Ricci identity shows (see previous\nsection) that for any spinor Q, the skew derivative\n(X\nY )C\nQ\nC\u2207\nXY\nZ\n+\u01eb \u2207Z(A \u2207 B) Q\n\n(\u2207XA \u2207YB \u2212 \u2207YB \u2207XA )Q = \u01ebAB \u2207\n\u223c 0\n\n(6.67)\n\nConsequently all n-th derivatives with the same indices\non their differentiation operators, regardless of the order\nof these operators, are equivalent (under \u223c). Moreover,\na useful consequence of eq. (6.67) is\n\u2207XC \u2207Y C Q \u223c \u01ebXY \u2207ZC \u2207ZC Q = \u01ebXY \u0003Q\n\n(6.68)\n\n\f9\nThe n-th derivatives can be decomposed into their totally symmetrised parts and products of the \u01eb spinor with\nn-th derivatives having fewer but still symmetrised free\nindices. The totally symmetrised parts are covered by\n(i)-(ii) above, so we need consider only the parts involving contractions. We will use induction to prove that\nall such components are algebraically expressible using\nquantities of the forms (i)-(iv) above; the induction hypothesis is in effect used whenever we quote eq. (6.67)\nor eq. (6.68), since the equivalence uses terms from lower\nderivatives and we are assuming that these can be expressed in terms of quantities of the forms (i)-(iv) above.\nThe parts involving contractions are symmetric sums\nof terms, each of which involves a contraction. If the\ncontraction indices belong to a pair of differentiation operators whose other indices are not contracted together,\nthe term can be ignored as a result of eq. (6.67) or is converted by eq. (6.68) into a term involving contractions of\nboth pairs of indices on a certain pair of differentiation\noperators (which will thus form a d'Alembertian). For\nthis second type of contraction term, we can bring the\nd'Alembertian to the left (by eq. (6.67)); such terms will\nthen be included in (iv) above. To complete the proof\nthat (i)-(iv) are sufficient to represent all components of\nthe n-th derivative of the Riemann curvature, we still\nhave to prove that terms in which the only contractions\nare between differentiation operators and Riemann spinor\nindices are covered by (i)-(iii). We now consider this case.\nUsing eq. (6.67) we bring all those differentiation operators which are contracted with the Riemann spinor\ncomponents to the right. We can ignore the Ricci scalar\n(since it has no indices on which to contract). By definition of \u03a8, contraction of a differentiation operator\nwith the Ricci spinor leads only to (derivatives of) \u03a8\nand the contraction between the Ricci spinor and a differentiation operator has a symmetric part which is \u03a8\nand a skew part which reduces, by the Bianchi identity eq. (6.65), to terms of the form (ii). The totally\nsymmetrised derivatives of \u03a8 are (iii) above, so we have\nonly to consider terms in which there is a contraction\nof a differentiation operator with \u03a8ABCD , that is, with\n\u2207N(A \u03a6BCD)N . We have now reduced the sufficiency proof\nto the consideration of (derivatives of) \u2207AF \u2207NA \u03a6BCDN\nand \u2207FB \u2207NA \u03a6B\nCDN . The first derivative, through the\nprevious remarks about terms with contractions on differentiation operators, lead to quantities which are already\nincluded. The second derivative is equivalent, modulo\nd'Alembertian type terms, to a sum of terms of the form\n\u2207FB \u2207NA \u03a6BCDN = \u2207FA \u2207NB \u03a6BCDN\n+\u01ebAB \u2207F G \u2207NG \u03a6BCDN (6.69)\nthe last expression following by the usual decomposition\nmethod. The first term on the right of eq. (6.69) reduces, by the Bianchi identity eq. (6.65), to a quantity\nof the form (ii) and the second reduces by eq. (6.67) and\neq. (6.68) to a quantity of the form (iv).\nHaving proved that the set given by (i)-(iv) enables all\nn-th derivatives to be expressed, we have to show it is\n\nminimal. This is done simply by a counting argument.\nIt is fairly easy to see, by a similar but simpler argument\nto that given above for counting invariants, that the constituent parts of \u2207n R as defined above contain respectively 2(n+1)+4, 2(n+1), [2(n\u22121)+1]+4 and, assuming\nthe induction hypothesis, 3(n + 2)(n \u2212 1)/2 real quantities. The total number of quantities in \u2207n R is therefore\n3(n + 4)(n + 1)/2 as required. This completes the proof\nof the theorem.\nIt should be mention that the theorem and the numbers of components to which we refer to above are for the\ngeneral case.\nIn the next section, all these results are applied to\nstudy the properties of a three-dimensional spacetime.\nAll the procedures were implemented using the GrTensorII package of Maple computer algebra system.\n7.\n\nTHREE-DIMENSIONAL HOMOGENEOUS\nG\u00d6DEL-TYPE SPACETIMES\n\nG\u00f6dels [37] solution of Einsteins field equations is the\nfirst cosmological model with rotating matter and closed\ntime-like curves. It has shown that General Relativity\ndoes not forbid spacetimes with global causal pathologies. Nevertheless, it can represent rotating objects with\nphysical meaning when surrounded by more standard\nspacetimes [38]. It should be mentioned that both timelike and null geodesics are not closed causal curves. The\nmodel is geodesically complete and has neither singularities nor horizons [20]. Due to its peculiarities, G\u00f6del-type\nsolutions have been studied with interest until nowadays\nwith a fairly large literature.\nRecently it has been shown that the three-dimensional\nEinstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant\nand a Chern-Simons term have G\u00f6del-type black holes\nand particle solutions [39]. Furthermore, it was shown\nthat a one-parameter family of the three-dimensional\nG\u00f6del-type metrics can be seen as arising from a deformation of anti-de Sitter metric, involving tilting and\nsquashing of the lightcones. The anti-de Sitter metric appears as the boundary between the causal and non-causal\nmodels [40].\nActually, the four-dimensional G\u00f6del spacetime metric\nhas a direct product structure ds2(4) = ds2(3) + dz 2 , where\nthe three-dimensional metric ds2(3) is a particular case of\nthe G\u00f6del-type line element, defined by\nds2(3) = \u2212[dt + H(r)d\u03c6]2 + D2 (r)d\u03c62 + dr2 .\n\n(7.70)\n\nAll four-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetimes that are\nhomogeneous in space and time (hereafter ST homogeneous), are characterized by two parameter m2 and \u03c9,\nwhere\n(i) H = \u03c9 r2 , D = r, when m = 0;\n(ii) H = (2 \u03c9/\u03bc2 )[1 \u2212 cos(\u03bcr)], D = (1/\u03bc)sin(\u03bcr),\nwhen m2 = \u2212\u03bc2 < 0;\n\n\f10\n(iii) H = (4 \u03c9/m2 )sinh2 (mr/2), D = (1/m)sinh(mr),\nwhen m2 \u2265 0.\nThe constant \u03c9 is the vorticity of these rotating spacetimes. The G\u00f6del spacetime is a particular case of the\nlast class, for which m2 = 2 \u03c9 2 , whose energy-momentum\ntensor T\u03bc\u03bd is given by\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1v\u03bc v\u03bd ,\nv \u03b1 = \u03b4 \u03b10 ,\n\u03ba\u03c1 = \u22122\u039b = m2 = 2 \u03c9 2 ,\n\n(7.71)\n(7.72)\n\nwhere \u03ba and \u039b are, respectively, the Einstein gravitational and the cosmological constants, \u03c1 is the fluid density and v \u03b1 its four-velocity. The four-dimensional G\u00f6del\nmodel has a 5-parameter group of isometries with an 1parameter isotropy subgroup.\nIt should be mentioned that the three-dimensional\nG\u00f6del-type line element eq. (7.70), besides being a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Symon theory, also\nsatisfies the three-dimensional Einsteins equations for all\nvalues of (m2 , \u03c9) and has 4-parameter group of isometries [39].\nThe (global) causality breakdown in ST homogeneous\nfour-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetimes depends on the\nbehavior of g\u03c6\u03c6 = D2 (r) \u2212 H 2 (r), since the circles defined by t, r, z = const are closed time-like curves when\ng\u03c6\u03c6 < 0 for a certain range of values of r. The causality\nfeatures are the following [41]: (i) for m2 < 0, there is an\ninfinite sequence of alternating causal and non causal regions; (ii) for 0 \u2264 m2 < 4 \u03c9 2 , there is only one non causal\nregion; (iii) for m2 \u2265 4 \u03c9 2 , there is no causality problem.\nAmong these solutions there is the Rebou\u00e7as-Tiomno solution [42], where m2 = 4 \u03c9 2 , which is conformally flat,\nhas a 7-parameter group of isometries and is not stably\ncausal. All models where m2 > 4 \u03c9 2 are stably causal.\nThus, the Rebo\u00e7as-Tiomno model is the boundary between the causal and non-causal models.\nThe problem of ST homogeneity of a four-dimensional\nspacetime endowed with a G\u00f6del-type metric eq. (7.70)\nwas investigated under restrictive assumptions on the\nform of the Killing vector fields [42, 43, 44]. The result\nwas a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, which\nwas rederived without assuming any simplifying hypothesis [45], by using a complete and invariant description\nof spacetimes obtained through the equivalence problem\ntechniques.\nAlthough the investigation of the causality features of\nthree-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetimes with parameters m2 and \u03c9 can be investigated following the approach\nused for the four-dimensional case, the situation concerning the problem of ST homogeneity in its all generality is\ncompletely different. The necessary and sufficient conditions for ST homogeneity in 4-dimensions [45] were obtained by using a minimal set of independent covariant\nderivatives of the curvature spinor [18], calculated in a\nfixed canonical frame. Unfortunately this approach can\nnot be used for three-dimensional manifolds, where the\nWeyl tensor vanishes identically [33], for the following\n\nreasons. First, it requires a different spinor formalism related to the Lorentz group SO(2, 1) of three-dimensional\nspacetimes. Second, since the minimal set [18] used depends on the Weyl spinor and its covariant derivatives,\na new minimal set of independent covariant derivatives\nof the curvature spinor must be find. Finally, since the\nstandard frame was fixed by aligning the frame vectors\nwith the principal directions of the Weyl spinor, a different canonical frame fixed by the principal directions of\nthe Ricci spinor is required.\nWe show that the ST homogeneous three-dimensional\nG\u00f6del-type manifolds have a 4-parameter group of isometries and an 1-parameter subgroup of isotropy. The\nequivalence of these spacetimes is discussed and they are\nfound to be characterized by two essential parameters\nm2 and \u03c9: identical pairs (m2 , \u03c9) correspond to equivalent (isometric) manifolds. The algebraic classifications\nand canonical forms of both the Ricci spinor \u03a6AB and\nthe conformal Cotton-York spinor \u03a8AB are presented,\nby using the formalism of two-component real spinors\n[28, 29, 30]. For a general pair (m2 , \u03c9), the CottonYork spinor \u03a8AB and the Ricci spinor \u03a6AB are both\nSegre type [(11),1]. The only exceptions are the conformally flat spacetimes given by the anti-de Sitter spacetime (m2 = 4 \u03c9 2 ), where \u03a6AB = 0 and \u03a8AB = 0, and\nthe spacetime without rotation (m2 6= 0, \u03c9 = 0), where\n\u03a8AB = 0. The group of isometries is also discussed. Finally, the results obtained are compared with those for\nthe four-dimensional G\u00f6del-type ST homogeneous metrics [45].\nIn this section we shall consider a three-dimensional\npseudo-Riemannian manifold M, endowed with a G\u00f6deltype metric eq. (7.70).\nFor arbitrary functions H(r) and D(r), the G\u00f6del-type\nthree-dimensional metrics are Segre type [11,1] and the\ncanonical frame is completely fixed. The canonical frame\nis found in the following way. First, we calculate the Ricci\nspinor \u03a6AB in the null triad\n\u03b81 = \u03c9 1 ,\n\n\u221a\n\u03b82 = (\u03c9 3 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )/ 2,\n\u221a\n\u03b83 = (\u03c9 3 + \u03c9 2 )/ 2,\n\n(7.73)\n\nwhere \u03c9 A is a Lorentz triad (\u03b7AB = diag(+1, +1, \u22121))\ngiven by\n\u03c9 1 = dr, \u03c9 2 = D(r)d\u03c6, \u03c9 3 = dt + H(r)d\u03c6.\n\n(7.74)\n\nWe find the non vanishing components \u03a600 , \u03a622 and \u03a611 .\nIn order to obtain the canonical form for the Segre type\n[11,1], where \u03a600 = \u03a622 , we perform a boost with parameter A(r) whose effect on the null frame above can be\nstated as\n\u03b8\u03031 = \u03b81 , \u03b8\u03032 =\n\np\n\u03b83\nA(r) \u03b82 , \u03b8\u03033 = p\nA(r)\n\n(7.75)\n\nThe canonical frame for the Segre type [11,1] is obtained\n\n\f11\nby choosing\nA(r)2 =\n\nD\u2032\u2032\nD\nD\u2032\u2032\nD\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212 ( HD )2 \u2212 ( HD )\u2032\n\u2212 ( HD )2 + ( HD )\u2032\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(7.76)\n\nwhere the prime denotes derivative with respect to r.\nUsing the canonical frame above one finds the following\nnon vanishing components of the Cartan's scalars, which\ncorrespond to the first step for q = 0 of our algorithm:\n\u03a600 = \u03a622\n\n\u0012 \u2032 \u00132 \u0012 \u2032 \u0013\u2032 #\nD\u2032\u2032\nH\nH\n, (7.77)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nD\nD\nD\n\"\n\u0012 \u2032 \u00132 #\n1 D\u2032\u2032\nH\n\u03a611 = \u2212\n,\n(7.78)\n\u2212\n12 D\nD\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\n1 H\u2032\nD\u2032\u2032\n.\n(7.79)\n\u2212\n\u039b = \u22122\nD\n4 D\nA(r)\n=\n4\n\n\"\n\nFor ST homogeneity one finds, from equation eq. (2.12),\nthat we must have tp = 0, that is, the number of functionally independent functions of the spacetime coordinates\nin the set Ip must be zero. Accordingly, all the above\nquantities of the minimal set must be constant. Thus,\nfrom eqs. (7.77)\u2013(7.79) one easily concludes that for a\nthree-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetime metric eq. (7.70)\nto be ST homogeneous it is necessary that\nH\u2032\nD\u2032\u2032\n= const \u2261 2 \u03c9,\n= const \u2261 m2 .\nD\nD\n\n(7.80)\n\nWe shall now show that the above necessary conditions\nare also sufficient for ST homogeneity. Indeed, under the\nconditions eqs. (7.80) we obtain that A(r) = 1 and the\nnon-vanishing Cartan's scalars corresponding to the first\nstep for q = 0 of our algorithm reduce to\n1\n\u03a600 = \u03a622 = 3 \u03a611 = \u2212 (m2 \u2212 4 \u03c9 2 )\n4\n2\n2\n\u039b = \u22122 (m \u2212 \u03c9 )\n\n(7.81)\n(7.82)\n\nwhere obtain the canonical form \u03a600 = \u03a622 = 3 \u03a611 for\nSegre type [(11),1]. Therefore, we group the G\u00f6del-type\nthree-dimensional spacetimes, according to the relevant\nparameters m2 and \u03c9, into three classes:\n(i) m2 6= 4 \u03c9 2 , where m2 , \u03c9 6= 0;\n(ii) m2 = 4 \u03c9 2 , where \u03c9 6= 0;\n(iii) m2 6= 0, \u03c9 = 0.\nNow we proceed by carrying out the next steps of the\nprocedure for testing equivalence in practice, for each\nclass of G\u00f6del-type three-dimensional spacetimes.\nFor the first class, we have that all metrics are Segre\ntype [(11),1]. Following the algorithm of the previous section, one needs to find the isotropy group which leaves the\nabove Cartan's scalars (canonical forms) invariant. The\n\ncurvature scalar \u039b is invariant under the whole Lorentz\ngroup SO(2, 1). Thus, the isotropy subgroup H0 is determined by the Ricci spinor, which is Segre type [(11),1]\nand is invariant under the group SO(2) of spatial rotations. So, we obtain that t0 = 0 and that the residual\ngroup H0 , which leaves the above Cartan's scalars invariant, is one-dimensional.\nWe proceed by carrying out the next step of our practical procedure, i.e., by calculating the Cotton-York spinor\nand the totally symmetrised covariant derivatives of the\nCartan's scalars eqs. (7.81)\u2013(7.82), that is, the first step\nfor q = 1. One finds the following non-vanishing quantities:\n3\n\u03a800 = \u03a822 = 3 \u03a811 = \u2212 \u03c9(m2 \u2212 4 \u03c9 2 ), (7.83)\n4\nwhere the Cotton-York spinor is in the canonical form of\nSegre type [(11),1].\nAs no new functionally independent function arose,\nt0 = t1 . Besides, the Cartan's scalars eq. (7.83) are\ninvariant under the same isotropy group (spatial rotations), i.e. H0 = H1 , and the algorithm stops. Thus\nwe obtain tp = 0 and 1-dimensional isotropy subgroup\nHp = SO(2). From eqs. (2.11)-(2.12) one finds that\nthe three-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetime have a fourdimensional group of isometries with a three-dimensional\norbit \u2013 the necessary conditions eqs. (7.80) are also sufficient for ST homogeneity.\nFor the next class (m2 = 4 \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 6= 0), following the\nalgorithm, we obtain that\n\u03a6AB = 0,\n3\n\u039b = \u2212 m2 .\n2\n\n(7.84)\n(7.85)\n\nThus t0 = 0 and dim(H0 ) = 3, since the group of invariance of \u03a6AB is now the Lorentz group SO(2, 1). Considering that the Cotton-York spinor \u03a8AB = 0 and that\nall derivatives of the Cartan's scalars vanishes identically,\nthe process terminate. This is the anti-de Sitter threedimensional spacetime. It is conformally flat and has a\n6-dimensional isometry group with a three-dimensional\nisotropy subgroup and acts on a three-dimensional orbit.\nTherefore, according to eq. (2.12), it is ST homogeneous.\nNote that the four-dimensional spacetime with the same\nvalues of m2 , \u03c9 is the conformally flat Rebou\u00e7as-Tiomno\nspacetime with a 7-parameter isometry group.\nFinally, for the last class (m2 6= 0, \u03c9 = 0), that is, the\nG\u00f6del-type spacetimes without rotation, we obtain for\nthe first step of the algorithm for q = 0 that\n1\n\u03a600 = \u03a622 = 3 \u03a611 = \u2212 m2\n4\n\u039b = \u22122m2\n\n(7.86)\n(7.87)\n\nwhere \u03a6AB is in canonical form for Segre type [(11),1].\nTherefore, we find again that t0 = 0 and that H0 is the\ngroup SO(2) of spatial rotations.\n\n\f12\nFollowing the algorithm, we obtain once more that the\nCotton-York spinor \u03a8AB = 0 and that all derivatives\nvanishes identically, and the process terminate. Since\ntp = 0 and Hp = SO(2), we obtain again a 4-parameter\nisometry group with a 1-dimensional isotropy subgroup.\nTherefore, it is a ST homogeneous conformally flat spacetime. Notice that the four-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetime without rotation is not conformally flat and has a\n6-dimensional isometry group.\nThe above results can be summarized in the following\ntheorems:\nTheorem 1 The necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor a three-dimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetime to be ST\n(locally) homogeneous are those given by equations\neqs. (7.80).\nTheorem 2 All ST locally homogeneous threedimensional G\u00f6del-type spacetimes admit a fourdimensional group of isometries with an 1-parameter\nisotropy subgroup and are characterized by two independent parameters m2 and \u03c9: identical pairs (m2 , \u03c9)\nspecify equivalent (isometric) spacetimes.\nIt is worth emphasizing that eqs. (7.81)-(7.87) are related to the corresponding equations for four-dimensional\nG\u00f6del-type spacetimes (eqs. (3.12)-(3.15) and eqs. (3.18)(3.25) in [45]). Therefore, our study here can be considered as the lower dimensional analogous of results in [45].\nThus, for example, the above theorems 1 and 2 relates to\nthe corresponding theorems in [45] (theorems 1 and 2 on\npage 891).\nFor all three-dimensional ST homogeneous G\u00f6del-type\nspacetimes the Segre type of the Ricci spinor is [(11),1].\nThe only exception is the anti-de Sitter spacetime, obtained when m2 = 4 \u03c9 2 , whose isometry group is 6dimensional. This is the only condition where the isom-\n\n[1] Ehlers J 1981 Christoffels Work on the Equivalence Problem for Riemannian Spaces and its Importance for Modern Field Theory of Physics, in E. B.

The CottonYork spinor has also the same Segre type [(11),1] for all\nG\u00f6del-type, except when the spacetime is anti-de Sitter (m2 = 4 \u03c9 2 ) and when the spacetime has no rotation (\u03c9 = 0, m2 6= 0), since both are conformally flat\n(\u03a8AB = 0).\nFor the sake of completeness, we should mention that\nthe equivalence problem techniques were used to investigate the five-dimensional G\u00f6del-type and generalized\nG\u00f6del-type pseudo-Riemannian spacetimes [46, 47]. Furthermore, G\u00f6del-type solutions with torsion were also\ninvestigated [48] through the equivalence problem techniques for Riemann-Cartan spacetimes [14, 15, 17].\nTo conclude, we should like to emphasize that as no\nfield equations were used to show the above results, they\nare valid for every three-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian\nG\u00f6del-type solution regardless of the theory of gravitation considered.\n8.\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nIt should be noted that the equivalence problem techniques, which we have used in this work, can certainly\nbe used in more general contexts. Among possible\napplications we mention, especially, that the equivalence\nproblem techniques for both general relativity and\nthree-dimensional gravitation can be used to investigate\ntheir interconnections in a coordinate invariant way.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nF.
