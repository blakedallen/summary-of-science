They were later generalised using the following definition\ndue to Fox [FoN]. Let M be a compact, connected surface, and let n \u2208 N. We\ndenote the set of all ordered n-tuples of distinct points of M , known as the nth\nconfiguration space of M , by:\nFn (M ) = {(p1 , . . . , pn ) | pi \u2208 M and pi 6= pj if i 6= j }.\nThe configuration spaces Fn (M ) play an important r\u00f4le in several branches of\nmathematics and have been extensively studied, see [CG] for example.\nThe symmetric group Sn on n letters acts freely on Fn (M ) by permuting\ncoordinates. The corresponding quotient will be denoted by Dn (M ). Notice\nthat Fn (M ) is a regular covering of Dn (M ). The nth pure braid group Pn (M )\n(respectively the nth braid group Bn (M )) is defined to be the fundamental\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\f758\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\ngroup of Fn (M ) (respectively of Dn (M )). If m > n are positive integers,\nthen we may define a homomorphism p\u2217 : Pm (M ) \u2212\u2192 Pn (M ) induced by the\nprojection p : Fm (M ) \u2212\u2192 Fn (M ) defined by p((x1 , . . . , xm )) = (x1 , . . . , xn ).\nRepresenting Pm (M ) geometrically as a collection of m strings, p\u2217 corresponds\nto forgetting the last (m \u2212 n) strings.\nWe adopt the convention that, unless explicitly stated, all homomorphisms\nPm (M ) \u2212\u2192 Pn (M ) in the text will be this one.\nIf M is without boundary, Fadell and Neuwirth study the map p, and show\n[FaN, Theorem 3] that it is a locally trivial fibration. The fibre over a point\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) of the base space is Fm\u2212n (M \\ {x1 , . . . , xn }) which we consider to\nbe a subspace of the total space via the map i : Fm\u2212n (M \\ {x1 , . . . , xn }) \u2212\u2192\nFm (M ) defined by i((y1 , . . . , ym\u2212n )) = (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , ym\u2212n ). Applying the\nassociated long exact homotopy sequence, we obtain the generalised pure braid\ngroup short exact sequence of Fadell and Neuwirth:\ni\n\np\u2217\n\n\u2217\n1 \u2212\u2192 Pm\u2212n (M \\ {x1 , . . . , xn }) \u2212\u2192\nPm (M ) \u2212\u2192 Pn (M ) \u2212\u2192 1,\n\n(PBS)\n\nwhere n \u2265 3 if M = S2 [Fa, FVB], n \u2265 2 if M = RP 2 [VB], and n \u2265 1\notherwise [FaN], and where i\u2217 and p\u2217 are the homomorphisms induced by the\nmaps i and p respectively. The sequence also exists in the case where M is the\n2-disc D 2 .\nThis short exact sequence has been widely studied, notably in recent work in\nrelation to the structure of the mapping class groups [PR]. An interesting question is that of whether the sequence (PBS) splits. If M is a K(\u03c0, 1) then the\nexistence of a section for p\u2217 is equivalent to that of a cross-section for the fibration. In [A2], Artin showed that if M = D 2 then the sequence (PBS) splits for\nall n \u2208 N. He used this result to solve the word problem in Bn (D 2 ) by showing\nthat Pn (D 2 ) may be expressed as a repeated semi-direct product of free groups.\nSince then, the splitting problem has been studied for other surfaces besides\nthe plane. In the case M = S2 , it was known that there exists a section on\nthe geometric level for all n \u2265 3 [Fa]. If M is the 2-torus then for all n \u2265 1,\nBirman exhibits an explicit algebraic section for the sequence (PBS) [Bi]. However, for compact orientable surfaces without boundary of genus g \u2265 2, she\nposes the question of whether the short exact sequence (PBS) splits. The\nauthors of this paper have recently resolved this question, the answer being\npositive if and only if n = 1 [GG1]. We will treat the case of non-orientable\nsurfaces of genus at least two in a forthcoming paper [GG3].\nIn this paper we shall study the braid groups of RP 2 , in particular the splitting\nof the sequence (PBS), and the existence of a section for the fibration p.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f759\n\nThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\nThese groups were first studied by Van Buskirk [VB], and more recently by\nWang [Wa]. Van Buskirk showed that P1 (RP 2 ) = B1 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Z2 , P2 (RP 2 )\nis isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8 , B2 (RP 2 ) is a dicyclic group of\norder 16, and for n > 2, Pn (RP 2 ) and Bn (RP 2 ) are infinite. He also proved\nthat these groups have elements of finite order (including one of order 2n),\nsuch elements later being characterised by Murasugi [M]. With respect to the\nsplitting problem, Van Buskirk showed that for n \u2265 2, neither the fibration\np : Fn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F1 (RP 2 ) nor the homomorphism p\u2217 : Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 )\nadmit a cross-section, but that the fibration p : F3 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F2 (RP 2 ) admits\na cross-section (and hence so does the corresponding homomorphism). In order\nto understand better the configuration space Fn (RP 2 ), n \u2208 N, in Proposition 6\nwe determine the homotopy type of its universal covering space. From this, we\nmay deduce its ith homotopy groups, i \u2265 2 (see Section 2):\nProposition 1 Let n \u2208 N, and let i \u2265 2.\n(1) If n = 1 then \u03c0i (F1 (RP 2 )) \u223c\n= \u03c0i (S2 ).\n(2) If n \u2265 2 then \u03c0i (Fn (RP 2 )) \u223c\n= \u03c0i (S3 ).\nWe then show that for m \u2265 4 and n = 2, 3, neither the fibration nor the short\nexact sequence (PBS) admit a section. More precisely:\nTheorem 2 Let m \u2265 4. Then:\n(1) the fibration p : Fm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F2 (RP 2 ) does not admit a cross-section;\n(2) the fibration p : Fm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F3 (RP 2 ) does not admit a cross-section.\nTheorem 3 For n = 2, 3 and for all m \u2265 4, the Fadell-Neuwirth pure braid\ngroup short exact sequence :\ni\n\np\u2217\n\n\u2217\n1 \u2212\u2192 Pm\u2212n (RP 2 \\ {x1 , . . . , xn }) \u2212\u2192\nPm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 1\n\ndoes not split.\nAlso in Section 2, we give an explicit algebraic section in the case m = 3 and\nn = 2, which we use in Section 3 to study further the structure of P3 (RP 2 ),\nnotably its subgroups abstractly isomorphic to P2 (RP 2 ).\nLet D 2 \u2286 RP 2 be a topological disc. This inclusion induces a (non-injective)\nhomomorphism \u03b9 : Bn (D 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Bn (RP 2 ). Let \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 be a standard set\nof generators of Bn (D 2 ), and let:\n\u2206n = (\u03c31 * * * \u03c3n\u22121 )n ,\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n(1)\n\n\f760\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\nbe the full twist braid of Bn (D 2 ). By convention, we set \u22061 = 1. The braid\n\u03b9(\u2206n ) which for n \u2265 2 is of order 2 and generates the centre Z(Bn (RP 2 )) of\nBn (RP 2 ) [VB], shall also be denoted by \u2206n , and will be called the full twist\nof Bn (RP 2 ). If k \u2208 N, then we shall say that \u03b1 \u2208 Bn (M ) is a kth root of\n\u2206n if \u03b1k = \u2206n and \u03b1j 6= \u2206n for all 1 \u2264 j < k . As we previously mentioned,\nthe torsion elements of Bn (RP 2 ), as well as the roots of the full twist were\ncharacterised by Murasugi. However, in both cases, the orders of the elements\nare not completely clear, even for Pn (RP 2 ). In Section 3, we study the torsion\nas well as the roots of \u2206n in Pn (RP 2 ) using methods different to those of\nMurasugi, and prove that for all n \u2265 2 the torsion of Pn (RP 2 ) is precisely 2\nand 4 (see Corollary 19). In Section 4, we do the same for Bn (RP 2 ):\nTheorem 4 Let n \u2265 2. Then Bn (RP 2 ) has an element of order l if and only\nif l divides either 4n or 4(n \u2212 1).\nFrom Proposition 23 (see also Section 4), \u2206n is the unique element of Bn (RP 2 )\nof order 2. It thus follows that:\nTheorem 5 Let n \u2265 2. Then the full twist \u2206n has a kth root in Bn (RP 2 ) if\nand only if k divides either 2n or 2(n \u2212 1).\nAcknowledgements This work began during the visit of the second author to\nthe Departmento de Matem\u00e1tica do IME-Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo during the\nperiod 7th July \u2013 3rd August 2002.

For m \u2265 1,\nFm (RP 2 ) is a 2m-dimensional smooth manifold [CJ], and so there exists a CWcomplex Km (of dimension less than or equal to 2m) whose homotopy type is\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f762\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\n^2\ng\nthat of Fm (RP 2 ) [Hi]. Let K\nm (respectively Fm (RP )) denote the universal\n2\ng\ncovering of Km (respectively Fm (RP )). Then K\nm is also a CW-complex\nwhose homotopy type is that of Fm^\n(RP 2 ) [Hi].\n(\nS2 \u2212\u2192RP 2\nTo prove part (5), we first prove the statement for n = 2. Let\nv 7\u2212\u2192[v]\ndenote\n( the usual covering map which identifies antipodal points. Consider the\n\u03c6 : V3,2 \u2212\u2192F2 (RP 2 )\nmap\nwhere V3,2 is the Stiefel manifold of orthogonal\n(e1 , e2 )7\u2212\u2192([e1 ], [e2 ])\n2-frames in Euclidean 3-space. Then \u03c6 : V3,2 \u2212\u2192 \u03c6(V3,2 ) is a covering map\nwith discrete fibre consisting of 4 points, and so V3,2 and \u03c6(V3,2 ) have the\nsame homotopy type. Further, \u03c6(V3,2 ) is a deformation retract of F2 (RP 2 );\nindeed, if ([v1 ], [v2 ]) \u2208 F2 (RP 2 ) then one may obtain an element of \u03c6(V3,2 )\nby deforming the second vector v2 within the plane containing v1 and v2 to\na vector v2\u2032 orthogonal to v1 . Although v2\u2032 is not unique in V3,2 , its image in\nRP 2 is, and this gives rise to a (well-defined) deformation retract of F2 (RP 2 )\nonto \u03c6(V3,2 ). It follows that V3,2 and F2 (RP 2 ) have the same homotopy type.\nSo their universal covers do too, and the result follows from the fact that V3,2\nis homeomorphic to RP 3 whose universal covering is S3 .\nNow suppose that n \u2265 3. Consider the fibration p : Fn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F2 (RP 2 ). By\npart (1), p induces an isomorphism of the ith homotopy groups of Fn (RP 2 ) and\nF2 (RP 2 ) for i \u2265 2. Composing p appropriately with homotopy equivalences\nbetween Kn and Fn (RP 2 ), and K2 and F2 (RP 2 ), it follows that there exists a\nmap Kn \u2212\u2192 K2 which induces an isomorphism of their ith homotopy groups\nfn \u2212\u2192 K\nf2 which induces an isomorphism of their\nfor i \u2265 2, and thus a map K\nth\nfn\ni homotopy groups for i \u2265 2. From Whitehead's theorem, we see that K\nf2 are homotopy equivalent [Wh2]. Since K\nfn and Fn^\nand K\n(RP 2 ) (respectively\nf2 and F2^\nK\n(RP 2 )) have the same homotopy type, then so do Fn^\n(RP 2 ) and\n\nF2^\n(RP 2 ), and this completes the proof of part (5).\n\nFinally, for part (6), consider the proof of part (5) in the case n = 2. The\ncovering map \u03c6 : V3,2 \u2212\u2192 \u03c6(V3,2 ) is induced by the natural free action of Z2 \u2295Z2\non V3,2 given as follows: if \u03b5i \u2208 {\u00b11} for i = 1, 2 then (\u03b51 , \u03b52 ) * (e1 , e2 ) =\n(\u03b51 e1 , \u03b52 e2 ). Recall that S3 may be considered as the topological group of\nquaternions of unit modulus. One may consider the quotient of S3 arising from\nthe standard action of Q8 in two stages: first quotient S3 by the centre Z2\nof Q8 to obtain RP 3 which is homeomorphic to V3,2 , then quotient V3,2 by\nQ8 /Z2 \u223c\n= Z2 \u2295 Z2 . We saw above that this quotient has the same homotopy\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f763\n\nThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\ntype as F2 (RP 2 ), and this completes the proof of part (6) and thus that of the\nproposition.\n\n2.2\n\nGeneralities on the splitting problem\n\nWe now consider the problem of determining a cross-section to the fibration\np\nFm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Fn (RP 2 ) defined in Section 1. If n \u2265 2 then this problem\nis equivalent to showing that the corresponding pure braid group short exact\nsequence splits:\nProposition 7 Let m > n \u2265 2. Then the fibration p : Fm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Fn (RP 2 )\nadmits a cross-section if and only if the corresponding pure braid group short\nexact sequence\np\u2217\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 Pm\u2212n (RP 2 \\ {x1 , . . . , xn }) \u2212\u2192 Pm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 1\nsplits.\nProof The 'only if' part is clear. For the 'if part', the existence of the given\nshort exact sequence and its splitting imply that we can find a section over\nthe 1-skeleton, and then over the 2-skeleton of Fn (RP 2 ) [Ba, Theorem 4.3.1].\nFrom [Wh1], the obstructions to extending the map over the q -skeleta, q \u2265 3,\nlie in cohomology classes whose coefficients belong to the (q \u2212 1)th homotopy\ngroup of the fibre Fm\u2212n (RP 2 \\ {x1 , . . . , xn }). But this fibre is an EilenbergMacLane space. Hence we can extend to a section over the entire space, and\nthe result follows.\nThe cases not covered by Proposition 7 may be resolved as follows:\nProposition 8\n(1) Let m \u2265 2. Then the surjective group homomorphism p\u2217 : Pm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192\nP1 (RP 2 ) does not admit a section.\n(2) Let m \u2265 2. Then the fibration p : Fm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F1 (RP 2 ) does not admit\na cross-section.\nProof\n\n(1) We first note that by the commutativity of the following diagram,\nPm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nP2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 )\n\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f764\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\nthe existence of a section for Pm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 ) implies that there\nexists a section for P2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 ) (cf [GG1, Proposition 3]),\nand hence it suffices to suppose that m = 2. To see that P2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192\nP1 (RP 2 ) does not admit a section, notice that P2 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Q8 has only\none element of order 2, the full twist \u22062 . But this element is sent to the\ntrivial element of P1 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Z2 under the projection onto P1 (RP 2 ), and\nso there is no section.\n(2) If there were to exist a cross-section for Fm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F1 (RP 2 ) then\nthere would exist a section for Pm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 ), which contradicts\npart (1).\nRemark 9 The fact that the fibration given in part (2) of Proposition 8 does\nnot admit a cross-section also follows from the fact that RP 2 has the fixed\npoint property (see also [VB]).\n\n2.3\n\nThe splitting problem for n \u2208 {2, 3}, and the structure of\nP3 (RP 2 )\n\nThis problem of the existence of a cross-section for the fibrations Fm (M ) \u2212\u2192\nFn (M ) was considered by Fadell and Neuwirth during the 1960's [Fa, FaN]. The\ncase M = RP 2 was later studied by Van Buskirk who constructed an explicit\ncross-section when m = 3 and n = 2 [VB]. He posed the question of the\ncharacterisation of the values of m and n for which there exists a cross-section.\nAs far as we know, if m \u2265 4 and n \u2265 2, the question is still completely open.\nWe first consider the case m = 3 and n = 2 of Van Buskirk, and construct an\nexplicit splitting of the corresponding pure braid group short exact sequence.\nThis will be useful later on when we study P3 (RP 2 ) in more detail. We show\nthat for m > 3 and n = 2, 3, the pure braid group short exact sequence does\nnot split. We obtain this result by showing that for m > 3, the fibration\nFm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F2 (RP 2 ) does not admit a cross-section.\nThe cross-section \u03c3 : F2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F3 (RP 2 ) defined by Van Buskirk V\nto the\n2 ) \u2212\u2192 F (RP 2 ) is given by \u03c3([v ], [v ]) = ([v ], [v ], [v\nfibration\nF\n(RP\nv2 ]),\n3\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\nV\nwhere\nis the vector product (cf the proof of part (5) of Proposition 6).

Since the kernel is isomorphic to F2 , the free group on two\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f765\n\nThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\ngenerators, it follows that P3 (RP 2 ) is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of\nF2 with Q8 .\nIf n \u2208 N, a generating set for Pn (RP 2 ) = \u03c01 (Fn (RP 2 ), (x1 , . . . , xn )) may be\nobtained as follows. By removing a disc from RP 2 , one obtains a disc with\na twisted band attached. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, let \u03c1i be a braid represented by\nthe loop based at the point xi which goes round the band, while the other\npoints xj , j 6= i, stay fixed. Let D 2 \u2286 RP 2 be a topological disc which\ncontains {x1 , . . . , xn }. This inclusion induces a (non-injective) homomorphism\nBn (D 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Bn (RP 2 ). Let \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 \u2208 Bn (RP 2 ) be the images of the usual\nArtin generators of Bn (D 2 ) under this homomorphism. For 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 n, set\n\u22121\n\u22121\nBj,k = \u03c3k\u22121 * * * \u03c3j+1 \u03c3j2 \u03c3j+1\n* * * \u03c3k\u22121\n\u2208 Pn (RP 2 ). Then the union of the \u03c1i and\nBj,k generates Pn (RP 2 ) (cf [VB, S]).\nFrom equation (2), we may obtain a presentation of P3 (RP 2 ), using the fact\nthat it is an extension [J]. It has generators {\u03c11 , \u03c12 , \u03c13 , B2,3 } where {\u03c11 , \u03c12 } are\n(coset representatives of) generators of the quotient P2 (RP 2 ), and {\u03c13 , B2,3 }\ngenerates the kernel.

Suppose on the contrary that such a section exists. Then there exists a map \u03be : F2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192\nF4 (RP 2 ) of the form \u03be(x1 , x2 ) = (x1 , x2 , f1 (x1 , x2 ), f2 (x1 , x2 )). For i = 1, 2, let\npi : F2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 RP 2 denote the map pi (x1 , x2 ) = xi . Then the four maps\nf1 , f2 , p1 , p2 : F2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 RP 2 are pairwise coincidence free, and so by Proposition 12, the induced homomorphisms are all surjective and pairwise distinct.\nBut, since P2 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Q8 and P1 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Z2 , it follows that there are only\nthree surjective homomorphisms P2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 ). We thus obtain a\ncontradiction, and the result follows.\nProof of Theorem 3 First let n = 2. By Proposition 7, if this sequence were\nto split then there would exist a cross-section to the given fibration. But this\nwould contradict Theorem 2(1).\nNow let n = 3. Consider the following commutative diagram:\nPm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P3 (RP 2 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nPm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ).\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f768\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\nSince the right-hand vertical arrow admits a section, if there were to exist a\nsection for Pm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P3 (RP 2 ) then there would also exist a section for\nPm (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ) which contradicts the previous paragraph.\nProof of Theorem 2(2) The result follows from Proposition 7 and Theorem 3. This also completes the proof of Theorem 2.\n\n3\n\nTorsion elements and roots of the full twist in\nPn (RP 2 )\n\nLet \u2206n denote the full twist braid of Bn (RP 2 ) as defined in equation (1).\nIn [M], Murasugi gave a characterisation of the torsion elements of Bn (RP 2 )\nand the quotient of Bn (RP 2 ) by its centre h\u2206n i. However, the orders of the\nelements are not clear, even in the case of Pn (RP 2 ). In this section, we study\nthe torsion and the roots of \u2206n in Pn (RP 2 ) with methods different to those of\nMurasugi. Using the pure braid group short exact sequence, we first show that\nthe possible torsion of Pn (RP 2 ) is 2 or 4. We then go on to prove that \u2206n is\nthe unique element of Pn (RP 2 ) of order 2, and that for all n \u2265 2, Pn (RP 2 )\npossesses elements of order 4. It will follow that the full twist possesses kth\nroots in Pn (RP 2 ), k \u2265 2, if and only if k = 2. Finally, using the semi-direct\nproduct decomposition given in Proposition 10, we study in more detail the\ntorsion elements of P3 (RP 2 ).\nWe first observe that the possible torsion of Pn (RP 2 ) is either 2 or 4.\nf\n\nLemma 13 Let 1 \u2212\u2192 K \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 H \u2212\u2192 1 be a short exact sequence of\ngroups such that K is torsion free. If x \u2208 G is a torsion element of order l,\nthen the element f (x) of H has also order l.\nProof Let x \u2208 G be a torsion element of order l. Therefore f (x)l = 1, and\nthe order k of f (x) divides l. Consider xk . It belongs to Ker(f ) = K , and\nl\n(xk ) k = 1. Since K is torsion free, it follows that xk = 1, and we conclude\nthat k = l.\nCorollary 14 Let n \u2208 N. Then the possible (non-trivial) torsion of Pn (RP 2 )\nis 2 or 4.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f769\n\nThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\nProof Since P1 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Z2 and P2 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Q8 , the result follows if n \u2208\n{1, 2}. If n \u2265 3, consider the following pure braid group short exact sequence:\np\u2217\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 Pn\u22122 (RP 2 \\ {x1 , x2 }) \u2212\u2192 Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 1.\nNow Fn\u22122 (RP 2 \\{x1 , x2 }) is a finite-dimensional Eilenberg-MacLane space, and\nso by a theorem of P. Smith, Pn\u22122 (RP 2 \\ {x1 , x2 }) is torsion free [FaN]. The\nresult follows from Lemma 13.\nProposition 15 Let n \u2265 2. Then the full twist \u2206n is the unique element of\nPn (RP 2 ) of order 2 in Pn (RP 2 ). In particular, the square of any element of\nPn (RP 2 ) of order 4 is the full twist.\nProof The proof of the first part is by induction. The result is true for n = 2,\nsince P2 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Q8 , and the unique element of order 2 of this group is the full\ntwist. Suppose that the result is true for some n \u2265 2. Consider the following\nshort exact sequence:\np\u2217\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 Pn+1 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 1,\nwhere F = \u03c01 (RP 2 \\{x1 , . . . , xn }) is torsion free. If \u03b1 \u2208 Pn+1 (RP 2 ) is of order 2\nthen p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 Pn (RP 2 ) is also of order 2 by Lemma 13, and so p\u2217 (\u03b1) = \u2206n by\nthe induction hypothesis. Since p\u2217 (\u2206n+1 ) = \u2206n , it follows that \u03b1 = \u2206n+1 *\nw, where w \u2208 F . Then 1 = \u03b12 = \u22062n+1 * w2 = w2 since \u2206n+1 generates\nZ(Pn+1 (RP 2 )) and is of order 2 [VB, M]. But F is torsion free, thus w = 1,\nand so \u2206n+1 is the unique element of Pn+1 (RP 2 ) of order 2. The fact that\nthe square of any element of Pn (RP 2 ) of order 4 is the full twist then follows\neasily.\nSince P2 (RP 2 ) has an element of order 4, it follows from Proposition 10 that\np\u2217\nP3 (RP 2 ) does too. In spite of the fact that Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ) does not\nadmit a section, we will show that Pn (RP 2 ) contains elements of order 4 for\nall n \u2265 2. We first recall a presentation of Bn (RP 2 ).\nProposition 16 (Van Buskirk [VB]) The following constitutes a presentation\nof the group Bn (RP 2 ):\nGenerators\n\n\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 , \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1n .\n\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f770\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\nRelations\n\n\u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03c3j \u03c3i\n\nif |i \u2212 j| \u2265 2,\n\n\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i \u03c3i+1\n\u03c3i \u03c1j = \u03c1j \u03c3i\n\nfor j 6= i, i + 1,\n\n\u03c1i+1 = \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c1i \u03c3i\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03c1\u22121\ni+1 \u03c1i \u03c1i+1 \u03c1i\n\u03c121\n\n=\n\n\u03c3i2\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 2,\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1,\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1,\n\n2\n= \u03c31 \u03c32 * * * \u03c3n\u22122 \u03c3n\u22121\n\u03c3n\u22122 * * * \u03c32 \u03c31 .\n\nWe warn the reader that the \u03c1i of Proposition 16 are slightly different from the\n\u03c1i defined in Section 2.3.

Then \u03c1j \u03c1i = \u03c1i \u03c1j Bi,j .\nProof Let 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121. The proof is by induction on j \u2212i. Suppose first that\nj \u2212 i = 1. Then \u03c1i+1 \u03c1i = \u03c1i \u03c1i+1 \u03c3i2 = \u03c1i \u03c1i+1 Bi,i+1 by Proposition 16. Suppose\nnow that the given equation holds for i and j satisfying 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n \u2212 1 and\n1 \u2264 j \u2212 i \u2264 n \u2212 2. Applying Proposition 16, we have:\n\u03c1j+1 \u03c1i = \u03c3j\u22121 \u03c1j \u03c3j\u22121 \u03c1i = \u03c3j\u22121 \u03c1j \u03c1i \u03c3j\u22121 = \u03c3j\u22121 \u03c1i \u03c1j Bi,j \u03c3j\u22121\n= \u03c1i \u03c3j\u22121 \u03c1j \u03c3j\u22121 \u03c3j Bi,j \u03c3j\u22121 = \u03c1i \u03c1j+1 Bi,j+1 ,\nwhich proves the lemma.\nProposition 18 Let n \u2208 N. In Bn (RP 2 ), (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 = \u2206n .\nProof If n = 1 then both sides are trivial, and the result is true. So let\nn \u2265 2. Let us first show that (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 is central in Bn (RP 2 ). From\nProposition 16, it suffices to prove that it commutes with each member of the\ngenerating set {\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 , \u03c1n }. By Lemma 17 we have that \u03c3i \u03c1i+1 \u03c1i \u03c3i\u22121 =\n\u03c3i \u03c1i \u03c1i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i2 * \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c1i \u03c3i\u22121 * \u03c3i \u03c1i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i2 \u03c1i+1 \u03c1i . Applying Proposition 16, we\nobtain:\n\u03c3i (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )\u03c3i\u22121 = \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c1i+2 \u03c3i \u03c1i+1 \u03c1i \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c1i\u22121 * * * \u03c11 = \u03c3i2 (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 ).\nHence:\n\u03c3i (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 ) = (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )\u03c3i\u22121 .\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n(5)\n\n\f771\n\nThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\nand so \u03c3i commutes with (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 . Now let us show that \u03c1n commutes\nwith (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 . Set w = B1,n * * * Bn\u22122,n Bn\u22121,n . Using Lemma 17 and\nProposition 16, we see that\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(\u03c11\u22121 * * * \u03c1\u22121\nn\u22121 )\u03c1n (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 ) = (\u03c11 * * * \u03c1n\u22122 )\u03c1n (\u03c1n\u22122 * * * \u03c11 )Bn\u22121,n\n\u22121\n= (\u03c1\u22121\n1 * * * \u03c1n\u22123 )\u03c1n (\u03c1n\u22123 * * * \u03c11 )Bn\u22122,n Bn\u22121,n\n\n= \u03c1n w.\n\n(6)\n\nThe relation w = \u03c3n\u22121 * * * \u03c32 \u03c312 \u03c32 * * * \u03c3n\u22121 holds in Bn (RP 2 ) since it holds in\n\u22121\n\u22121 using equation (5), and so\nBn (D 2 ). Thus (\u03c1\u22121\n1 * * * \u03c1n\u22121 )w(\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 ) = w\nfrom equation (6), we obtain\n\u22121 2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2\n(\u03c1\u22121\n1 * * * \u03c1n\u22121 ) \u03c1n (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 ) = (\u03c11 * * * \u03c1n\u22121 )\u03c1n w(\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )\n\n= \u03c1n ww\u22121 = \u03c1n ,\nwhich shows that \u03c1n commutes with (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 .\nHence (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 belongs to Z(Bn (RP 2 )), which is the cyclic subgroup of order 2 generated by \u2206n . Suppose that (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 = 1. Clearly, \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 6=\n1 (since under the projection Pn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P1 (RP 2 ), \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 is sent to\n\u03c11 ). So \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 is an element of Pn (RP 2 ) of order 2. By Proposition 15,\nit follows that \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 = \u2206n . But this cannot be so, because \u2206n is central in Bn (RP 2 ), while by equation (5), \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 is not. We conclude that\n(\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 = \u2206n .\nSince by Proposition 18 the element \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 is of order 4, the characterisation of the torsion of Pn (RP 2 ) thus follows from Corollary 14:\nCorollary 19 Let n \u2265 2. Then the (non-trivial) torsion of Pn (RP 2 ) is precisely 2 and 4.\nWe have a result analogous to that of Proposition 18 for \u03c1n * * * \u03c11 :\nProposition 20 Let n \u2208 N. In Bn (RP 2 ), (\u03c1n * * * \u03c11 )2 = \u2206n .\nProof If n = 1 then \u03c121 = \u22061 = 1. So suppose that n \u2265 2. First, using\nProposition 16 and the definition of w given in the proof of Proposition 18, we\nsee that\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03c12n = \u03c3n\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 \u03c11 \u03c31\u22121 * * * \u03c3n\u22121\n* \u03c3n\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 \u03c11 \u03c31\u22121 * * * \u03c3n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n= \u03c3n\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22122 * * * \u03c3n\u22121\n= w\u22121 .\n\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n(7)\n\n\f772\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\nBy Proposition 16 and Lemma 17, we observe that:\n(\u03c1n * * * \u03c11 )2 = \u03c1n \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 \u03c1n\u22121 \u03c1n \u03c1n\u22122 * * * \u03c11 Bn\u22121,n\n= \u03c1n (\u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 )2 \u03c1n w = \u03c1n \u2206n \u03c1n w = \u2206n \u03c12n w = \u2206n ,\nusing equation (7) and the fact that \u2206n is central. The result follows.\nNow we go on to study P3 (RP 2 ) in more detail, using the fact that it is a\nsemi-direct product. Since P2 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Q8 , P2 (RP 2 ) has 6 elements of order 4\nwhich make up three distinct conjugacy classes. We will show that the same\nhappens in P3 (RP 2 ).\nProposition 21 Let p\u2217 : P3 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ) be the homomorphism induced by the projection onto the first two coordinates. Then:\n(1) p\u2217 sends the set of elements of P3 (RP 2 ) of order 4 surjectively onto the\nset of elements of P2 (RP 2 ) of order 4;\n(2) any two elements of P3 (RP 2 ) of order 4 which project onto the same\nelement of P2 (RP 2 ) are conjugate;\n(3) the set of elements of P3 (RP 2 ) of order 4 form three distinct conjugacy\nclasses;\n(4) if H is a subgroup of P3 (RP 2 ) abstractly isomorphic to Q8 , then p\u2217 (H) \u223c\n=\nP2 (RP 2 ). Further, any two such subgroups are conjugate.\n\nProof The proof of this proposition will rely on the results of Section 2, notably the semi-direct product P3 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= F2 \u22caP2 (RP 2 ) given by Proposition 10,\nand the corresponding representation \u03c6 : P2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Aut(F2 ) of Corollary 11.\nIf z \u2208 P2 (RP 2 ), let us write \u03c6(z) = \u03c6z . In what follows we shall identify\nP3 (RP 2 ) with F2 \u22ca P2 (RP 2 ), in particular, if (w, t) \u2208 F2 \u22ca P2 (RP 2 ) then\np\u2217 ((w, t)) = t \u2208 P2 (RP 2 ).\npart (1) follows directly from the existence of the splitting. For part (2), suppose\nthat the element (w, t) \u2208 F2 \u22caP2 (RP 2 ) is of order 4. By part (1), t \u2208 P2 (RP 2 ) is\nof order 4, and hence so is (1, t) \u2208 F2 \u22ca P2 (RP 2 ). To prove the result, it suffices\nto show that (w, t) and (1, t) are conjugate. From the explicit description of \u03c6\ngiven in Corollary 11, one sees that \u03c6t2 = IdF2 , and so:\n(1, 1) = (w, t)4 = (w\u03c6t (w), t2 )2 = (w\u03c6t (w)\u03c6t2 (w\u03c6t (w)), t4 ) = ((w\u03c6t (w))2 , 1).\nSince F2 is torsion free and (w\u03c6t (w))2 = 1, it follows that w\u03c6t (w) = 1, and\nso \u03c6t (w) = w\u22121 . Let us characterise such w \u2208 F2 . Since \u03c6t2 = IdF2 for\nall t \u2208 P2 (RP 2 ), we see that \u03c6t3 = \u03c6t , and so it suffices to suppose that\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f773\n\nThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\nt \u2208 {\u03c11 , \u03c12 , \u03c11 \u03c12 }. Using the description of the associated automorphisms \u03c6t\ngiven in Corollary 11, we see in each of the three possible cases that w is of the\n(reduced) form w = w1 w2 , where w2 = \u03c6t (w1\u22121 ). This implies that:\n(w1 , 1) * (1, t) * (w1 , 1)\u22121 = (w1 , 1) * (1, t) * (w1\u22121 , 1) = (w1 , 1) * (\u03c6t (w1\u22121 ), t) = (w, t),\nand part (2) follows. One may then check easily that if (1, t) and (1, t\u2032 ) are\nconjugate in F2 \u22ca P2 (RP 2 ) then t and t\u2032 are conjugate in P2 (RP 2 ). Since\nthe set of elements of P2 (RP 2 ) of order 4 splits into three conjugacy classes,\npart (3) follows from parts (1) and (2).\nFor the first part of (4), since H is a torsion subgroup and the kernel of p\u2217\nis torsion free, it follows that p\u2217 |H : H \u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ) is injective, and thus\nan isomorphism. For the second part, let K be the subgroup of P3 (RP 2 )\ngenerated by s(\u03c11 ) and s(\u03c12 ), where s : P2 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P3 (RP 2 ) is the section\nof Proposition 10, and let H be a subgroup of P3 (RP 2 ) which is isomorphic to\nQ8 . To prove the statement, it suffices to prove that H is conjugate to K . From\nabove, p\u2217 (H) = P2 (RP 2 ), so let b \u2208 H be such that p\u2217 (b) = \u03c11 . By part (2),\nthere exists \u03b3 \u2208 P3 (RP 2 ) such that \u03b3b\u03b3 \u22121 = s(\u03c11 ). Let H \u2032 = \u03b3H\u03b3 \u22121 . Then it\nsuffices to prove that H \u2032 = K . To do so, first notice that s(\u03c11 ) \u2208 H \u2032 \u2229 K . Let\nc \u2208 H \u2032 be such that p\u2217 (c) = \u03c12 . Again by part (2), since p\u2217 (s(\u03c12 )) = \u03c12 , there\nexists (w, t) \u2208 F2 \u22ca P2 (RP 2 ) such that:\nc = (w, t) * (1, \u03c12 ) * (w, t)\u22121 = (w\u03c6t\u03c12 t\u22121 (w\u22121 ), t\u03c12 t\u22121 ).\n\n(8)\n\nWe have once more identified P3 (RP 2 ) with F2 \u22caP2 (RP 2 ), in particular, s(\u03c1i ) =\n(1, \u03c1i ) for i = 1, 2. By Corollary 11, we obtain \u03c6\u03c12 = \u03c6\u03c1\u22121 , and since t\u03c12 t\u22121 is\n2\n\nof the form \u03c1\u00b11\n2 , it follows that \u03c6t\u03c12 t\u22121 = \u03c6\u03c12 . From equation (8), we obtain:\nc\u22121 = (w\u03c6\u03c12 (w\u22121 ), \u03c1\u22131\n2 ).\n\n(9)\n\nOn the other hand, s(\u03c11 ) * c * (s(\u03c11 ))\u22121 = c\u22121 in H \u2032 , so:\n\u22121\nc\u22121 = (1, \u03c11 ) * (w\u03c6\u03c12 (w\u22121 ), \u03c1\u00b11\n= (\u03c6\u03c11 (w\u03c6\u03c12 (w\u22121 )), \u03c1\u22131\n2 ) * (1, \u03c11 )\n2 ).\n\n(10)\n\nCombining equations (9) and (10), we see that w\u03c6\u03c12 (w\u22121 ) is a fixed element of\n\u03c6\u03c11 , but by Corollary 11, the only such element is the identity. So \u03c6\u03c12 (w\u22121 ) =\nw\u22121 , and similarly we conclude that w = 1. By equation (8), we see that\n\u00b11\n\u2032\nc = (1, \u03c1\u00b11\n2 ) = s(\u03c12 ), and since H is generated by {c, s(\u03c11 )}, it follows that\nH \u2032 = K as required.\nRemark 22 For the case P3 (RP 2 ), our results are compatible with those of\nMurasugi [M]. His classification shows that the torsion elements of B3 (RP 2 )\nare, up to powers and conjugacy, \u03c31 \u03c32 (order 6), \u03c31 \u03c32 \u03c31 and \u03c11 \u03c32 (both of\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f774\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\norder 4), \u03c12 \u03c31 (order 8), and \u03c13 \u03c32 \u03c31 (order 12). The torsion elements of\nP3 (RP 2 ) are, up to powers and conjugacy, \u22063 (order 2), \u03c12 \u03c11 and \u03c13 \u03c12 \u03c11 (both\n\u22121\n\u00b11 projects onto \u03c1\u00b11 ,\nof order 4). Then \u03c32 (\u03c12 \u03c11 )\u00b11 \u03c32\u22121 = (\u03c1\u22121\n3 \u03c12 \u03c13 \u03c12 \u03c13 \u03c11 )\n1\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n(\u03c13 \u03c12 \u03c11 )\nprojects onto (\u03c12 \u03c11 ) , and the element \u03c31 \u03c32 (\u03c12 \u03c11 )\u00b11 \u03c32\u22121 \u03c31\u22121 =\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u00b11 projects onto \u03c1\u22131 .\n(\u03c121 \u03c11\u22121 \u03c1\u22121\n2 \u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c13 \u03c12 \u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c11 \u03c12 )\n2\n\n4\n\nRoots of the full twist and torsion elements in\nBn(RP 2 )\n\nIn this section, we study the torsion of the group Bn (RP 2 ) for n \u2265 2. In [M],\nMurasugi introduces elements A1 (n, r, s, q) and A2 (n, r, s, q) of Bn (RP 2 ), and\nshows that if r > 0 then there are the relations mp = 2rk and mq = sk for\nintegers m 6= 0, and for these integers, we have A1 (n, r, s, q)2rm = \u2206n and\nA2 (n, r, s, q)4rm = 1. But the order of such elements is not given. We show\nthat the full twist \u2206n is the unique element of order two in Bn (RP 2 ), and\nthen prove Theorem 4 which says that Bn (RP 2 ) has an element of order k\nif and only if k divides either 4n or 4(n \u2212 1). As a consequence, we obtain\nTheorem 5, so that the full twist \u2206n has a kth root if and only if k either\ndivides 2n or 2(n \u2212 1). Our techniques are different to those of Murasugi, in\nparticular, we use the notion of intermediate coverings between Fn (RP 2 ) and\nDn (RP 2 ) introduced in [GG2].\nProposition 23 If n \u2265 2 then the full twist \u2206n is the unique element of\nBn (RP 2 ) of order 2.\nProof Let \u03c0 : Bn (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Sn denote the natural epimorphism, and suppose\nthat \u03b1 is an element of Bn (RP 2 ) of order 2 different from \u2206n . So \u03b1 \u2208\n/ Pn (RP 2 )\nby Proposition 15. It follows that the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1) is a product\nof a non-zero number of transpositions and a certain number (perhaps zero)\nof cycles of length one. Let D2,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) = Fn (RP 2 )/S2 \u00d7 Sn\u22122 be the intermediate covering between Fn (RP 2 ) and Dn (RP 2 ) [GG2], and let B2,n\u22122 (RP 2 )\ndenote the corresponding subgroup of Bn (RP 2 ). Consider the homomorphism\n\u03be : B2,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 B2 (RP 2 ) induced by the projection D2,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192\nD2 (RP 2 ) onto the first two coordinates. By conjugating \u03b1 if necessary, we\nmay suppose without loss of generality that \u03b1 \u2208 B2,n\u22122 (RP 2 ), and that the\npermutation of \u03be(\u03b1) is a transposition. Since \u03b1 is of order 2 then so is \u03be(\u03b1).\nBut from [VB], the group B2 (RP 2 ) is known to be the dicyclic group of order 16 comprised of the identity, 10 elements of order 4, 4 elements of order 8\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\n775\n\nand a single element of order 2 which is the full twist \u22062 . But this cannot be\nthe case because \u22062 \u2208 P2 (RP 2 ), so its permutation is trivial. We thus obtain\na contradiction, and this proves the result.\nWe now derive a necessary condition on the permutation associated with a\ntorsion element.\nLemma 24 (Fundamental Lemma) Let n \u2208 N. Let \u03b1 \u2208 Bn (RP 2 ) \\ Pn (RP 2 )\nbe a torsion element. If the permutation \u03c0(\u03b1) contains at least two cycles of\nlength one then \u03b1 6= \u2206n but \u03b12 = \u2206n .\nProof Let \u03b1 \u2208 Bn (RP 2 ) \\ Pn (RP 2 ) (so n \u2265 2) be a torsion element of order k\nsuch that the permutation \u03c0(\u03b1) contains at least two cycles of length one.\nSince \u03b1 \u2208\n/ Pn (RP 2 ), Proposition 15 implies that \u03b1 6= \u2206n . Now \u2206n belongs\nto Z(Bn (RP 2 )), so \u03b1 would satisfy the equation \u03b12 = \u2206n if and only if its\nconjugates did too. Conjugating \u03b1 if necessary, we may thus assume without\nloss of generality that \u03b1 belongs to the subgroup B1,1,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) of Bn (RP 2 )\ncorresponding to the intermediate covering D1,1,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) = Fn (RP 2 )/S1 \u00d7S1 \u00d7\nSn\u22122 . Consider the homomorphism \u03be : B1,1,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 P2 (RP 2 ) induced\nby the projection D1,1,n\u22122 (RP 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F2 (RP 2 ) onto the first two coordinates.\nNow P2 (RP 2 ) \u223c\n= Q8 , thus (\u03be(\u03b1))2 = \u2206\u03b52 , where \u03b5 \u2208 {0, 1}. Since \u2206n \u2208\n2\n2\nB1,1,n\u22122 (RP ) and \u03be(\u2206n ) = \u22062 , we have that \u03b12 * \u2206\u2212\u03b5\nn \u2208 Ker(\u03be) = Bn\u22122 (RP \\\n2k = 1 because \u2206 is\n{x1 , x2 }) which we know to be torsion free. But (\u03b12 * \u2206\u2212\u03b5\nn\nn )\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b5\ncentral in Bn (RP ). Hence \u03b1 = \u2206n . If \u03b5 = 0 then \u03b1 = 1 which since \u03b1 6= 1\nimplies that \u03b1 = \u2206n by Proposition 23. But we have already established that\nthis cannot be the case. Hence \u03b5 = 1, and thus \u03b12 = \u2206n as required.\nCorollary 25 Let n \u2208 N. If \u03b1 is a torsion element of Bn (RP 2 ) then its order\ndivides 4n or 4(n \u2212 1).\nProof Let l denote the order of \u03b1. If \u03b1 \u2208 Pn (RP 2 ) then the result follows\nfrom Proposition 15. So suppose that the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1) contains\nat least one cycle of length greater than or equal to two. Then there are three\npossibilities:\n(1) the non-trivial cycles in the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1) are all of the\nsame length l1 . Set l0 = 1, and for i = 0, 1, let ki be the number of\ncycles of length li in the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1). If k0 \u2265 2 then\nit follows from the Fundamental Lemma that \u03b12 = \u2206n , and hence \u03b1 is\nof order 4 which divides 4n as required. So suppose that k0 \u2208 {0, 1}.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\f776\n\nDaciberg Lima Gon\u00e7alves and John Guaschi\n\nThen \u03b1l1 \u2208 Pn (RP 2 ), and so by Corollary 14, either \u03b1l1 is the identity\nelement, and so \u03b1 is of order l, or \u03b1l1 is of order 2, and so \u03b1 is of order\n2l, or else \u03b1l1 is of order 4, and so \u03b1 is of order 4l (we have used the\nfact that \u03b1j \u2208\n/ Pn (RP 2 ) for all 1 \u2264 j < l). Since n = k0 + l1 k1 , we see\nthat l1 divides n or n \u2212 1, and so the order of \u03b1 divides 4n or 4(n \u2212 1)\nas required.\n(2) the non-trivial cycles in the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1) are of two different lengths l1 , l2 with 1 < l1 < l2 . Set l0 = 1, and for i = 0, 1, 2,\nlet ki be the number of cycles of length li in the cycle decomposition of\n\u03c0(\u03b1). Applying the Fundamental Lemma to \u03b1, we see that k0 \u2208 {0, 1}.\nConsider the element \u03b1l1 ; it belongs to Bn (RP 2 )\\Pn (RP 2 ), and contains\nat least two cycles of length one. Applying the Fundamental Lemma, it\nfollows that l2 = 2l1 , and \u03b12l1 = \u2206n . Hence \u03b1 is of order 4l1 . Now\nn = k0 + k1 l1 + k2 l2 = k0 + k1 l1 + 2k2 l1 , hence l1 divides n or n \u2212 1,\nand thus the order 4l1 of \u03b1 divides 4n or 4(n \u2212 1) as required.\n(3) the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1) contains cycles of at least three different\nlengths l1 , l2 , l3 with 1 < l1 < l2 < l3 . Then \u03b1l1 is a torsion element\nbelonging to Bn (RP 2 ) \\ Pn (RP 2 ) containing at least two cycles of length\none. By the Fundamental Lemma, \u03b12l1 = \u2206n , so the cycle decomposition of \u03c0(\u03b1) contains only transpositions and trivial cycles, but this is\nimpossible since l1 < l2 < l3 .\nLet n \u2265 2. We will show that there are elements in Bn (RP 2 ) of order 4n and\nof order 4(n \u2212 1). In Bn (RP 2 ), consider the following elements:\n)\n\u22121\na = \u03c3n\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 * \u03c11\n(11)\n\u22121\nb = \u03c3n\u22122\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 * \u03c11 .\nProposition 26 Let n \u2265 2.

Indeed if the\nwe see that for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1, bj = aj \u03c3j\u22121\nresult is true for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 2 then using the conclusion of the first paragraph\nof this proof, we see that\n\u22121\nbj+1 = aj \u03c3j\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 * a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121 a * \u03c3n\u22121 a\n\u22121\n= aj+1 a\u22121 \u03c3j\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 * aa\u22122 \u03c3n\u22121 a2 * a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121 a\n\n= aj+1 \u03c3j\u22121 * * * \u03c31\u22121 a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121 a.\nHence\n\u22121\nb2(n\u22121) = (an\u22121 \u03c3n\u22122\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121 a)2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n= a2n\u2212(n+1) (\u03c3n\u22122\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121 a)an+1\u22122 (\u03c3n\u22122\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121 a)aa\u22121\n\u22121\n= \u2206n \u03c3n\u22121 * * * \u03c31 a\u22121 \u03c3n\u22121\n* * * \u03c31\u22121 a\u22121\n\n= \u2206n \u03c3n\u22121 * * * \u03c31 \u03c1\u22122\n1 \u03c31 * * * \u03c3n\u22121 = \u2206n ,\nby Proposition 16. As for the case of a, to see that b is of order 4(n \u2212 1), it\nsuffices to prove that bn\u22121 is not central. An easy induction argument shows\nthat b\u2212i \u03c31 bi = \u03c3i+1 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 3. Further, a calculation analogous to that\nabove of a\u22122 \u03c3n\u22121 a2 shows that b\u22122 \u03c3n\u22121 b2 = \u03c31\u22121 . So b\u2212(n\u22121) \u03c31 b(n\u22121) = \u03c31\u22121 ,\nthus bn\u22121 is not central, and the proof of the proposition is complete.\nThis enables us to prove Theorem 4:\nProof of Theorem 4 To prove the 'only if' part, it suffices to consider an\nappropriate power of one of the elements a and b, and to apply Proposition 26.\nThe 'if' part follows directly from Corollary 25.\nRemark 27 It is possible (by an induction argument for example) to prove\nthat bn\u22121 = \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c11 and an = \u03c1n * * * \u03c11 . Then the 'only if' part of Theorem 4\nalso follows from Propositions 18 and 20.\nFinally, we are able to prove Theorem 5.\nProof of Theorem 5 To prove the 'only if' part, let \u03b1 be a kth root of the full\ntwist. Then \u03b1 is a torsion element of Bn (RP 2 ) of order 2k . By Theorem 4,\nit follows that 2k divides either 4n or 4(n \u2212 1), and the result follows. To\nprove the 'if part', the element a (respectively, b) given in equation (11) has\nthe property that its 2nth (respectively, 2(n \u2212 1)th ) power is of order 2, and\nso is the full twist \u2206n by Proposition 23. The result then follows by taking an\nappropriate power of a or b.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 4 (2004)\n\n\fThe braid groups of the projective plane\n\n779\n\nRemark 28 In the case n = 3, it follows from Remark 22 that our results in\nthis section are compatible with those of Murasugi.\n\nReferences\n[A1]\n\nE Artin, Theorie der Z\u00f6pfe, Abh.
