In general a k-dimensional (kD) paraunitary matrix over C is a matrix U (z) where z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zk ) is a vector\nof (commuting) variables {z1 , z2 , . . . , zk } such that U (z)U \u2217 (z\u22121 ) = 1 and z\u22121 = (z1\u22121 , z2\u22121 , . . . , zk\u22121 ).\nOver fields other than C a paraunitary matrix is a matrix U (z) satisfying U (z)U (z\u22121 )T = 1.\nParaunitary matrices are important in signal processing and in particular the concept of a paraunitary\nmatrix plays a fundamental role in the research area of multirate filterbanks and wavelets. In the\npolyphase domain, the synthesis matrix of an orthogonal filter bank is a paraunitary matrix; see for\nexample [5].\nOrthogonal filter banks may also be used to construct orthonormal wavelet bases [15, 17]; see also\nreferences in [14]. Paraunitary matrices over finite fields have been studied for their own interest and for\napplications; see for example [16].\nHere general methods for constructing and designing such matrices from complete orthogonal sets of\nidempotents together with related matrix schemes are presented. This includes methods for designing\nnon-separable multidimensional paraunitary matrices. Construction methods for complete orthogonal\nsets of idempotents are included. Group ring construction methods were the original motivation and\nfrom these more general methods evolved. A structure called the tangle of matrices is introduced; this\nmay have independent interest.\nIn certain cases specialising the variables of the paraunitary matrices allows the construction of\nseries of regular real or complex Hadamard matrices. Walsh-Hadamard matrices, used extensively in the\ncommunications' areas, are examples of such regular Hadamard matrices. Complex Hadamard matrices\narise in the study of operator algebras and in the theory of quantum computation.\nIt is noted that the renowned building blocks for 1D paraunitary matrices over C due to Belevitch and\nVaidyanathan as described in [7] are constructed from W = {F1 , F2 } where W is a complete orthogonal\nset of two idempotents in which F1 has rank 1 and F2 has rank (n \u2212 1) with n the size of the matrices\nunder consideration. See section 4.9 below for details on this.\nConnections between group rings, matrices and design of codes have been established in [9], [10] and\n[11]; these are related but independent.\nDesigning non-separable multidimensional paraunitary matrices is deemed difficult as there is no\nmultidimensional factorisation theorem corresponding to the 1D factorisation theorem of Belevitch and\nVaidyanathan ([7]). For the finite impulse response (FIR) case there seems to be only a few examples\n\u2217 Keywords:\n\nParaunitary matrix, Signal Processing, MSC 2010 Classification: 15B99, 94A12\nUniversity of Ireland Galway, email: Barryj 2001@yahoo.co.uk\n\u2021 National Universiy of Ireland Galway, email: Ted.Hurley@Nuigalway.ie\n\n\u2020 National\n\n1\n\n\fsuch as [18]. See also [14] for background and further discussion. In [13] a factorization of a subclass of\n2D paraunitary matrices is obtained; these though involve IIR (infinite impulse response) systems.\nIn Section 9 results are obtained on the ranks of the idempotents and on the determinants of the\nparaunitary matrices formed.\nThe concept of a pseudo-paraunitary matrix is introduced in Section 8 and construction methods for\nthese are given. These may also be considered as FIR (finite impulse response) systems.\n\n2\n\nFurther Notation\n\nThe book [4] is an excellent reference for background material on the algebraic structures used.\nNow F denotes a general field, R denotes a general ring, C denotes the complex numbers, R denotes\nthe real numbers and Q denotes the rational numbers. Also Fq denotes the finite field of q elements,\nRn\u00d7m denotes the set of n \u00d7 m matrices with coefficients from R and R[z] denote the polynomial ring\nwith coefficients from R in commuting variables z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ). Note that R[z]n\u00d7m = Rn\u00d7m [z].\nLet R be a ring with identity 1R = 1. (In general 1 will denote the identity of the system under\nconsideration.) A complete family of orthogonal idempotents is a set {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek } in R such that\n(i) ei 6= 0 and e2i = ei , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k;\n(ii) If i 6= j then ei ej = 0;\n(iii) 1 = e1 + e2 + . . . + ek .\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nThe idempotent ei is said to be primitive if it cannot be written as ei = ei + ei where ei , ei are\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\nidempotents such that ei 6= 0, ei 6= 0 and ei ei = 0. A set of idempotents is said to be primitive if each\nidempotent in the set is primitive.\nVarious methods for constructing complete orthogonal sets of idempotents are derived below. Such\nsets always exist in F G, the group ring over a field F , when charF 6 | |G|. See [4] for properties of group\nrings and related definitions. These idempotent sets are related to the representation theory of F G.\nA mapping \u2217 : R \u2192 R in which r 7\u2192 r\u2217 , (r \u2208 R) is said to be an involution on R if and only if (i)\n\u2217\u2217\nr = r, \u2200r \u2208 R, (ii) (a + b)\u2217 = a\u2217 + b\u2217 , \u2200a, b \u2208 R, and (iii) (ab)\u2217 = b\u2217 a\u2217 , \u2200a, b \u2208 R.\nWe shall be particularly interested in the case where \u2217 denotes complex conjugate transpose in the\ncase of matrices over C and denotes transpose for matrices over other fields. Such a mapping \u2217 on group\nrings is also defined below.\nAn element r \u2208 R is said to be symmetric (relative to \u2217 ) if r\u2217 = r and a set of elements is said to be\nsymmetric if each element in the set is symmetric.\nQ \u2297 R denotes the tensor product of the matrices Q, R.\nAs already noted A\u2217 is used to denote the complex conjugate transpose of a matrix A. Suppose R\nis a ring with involution \u2217 . Then \u2217 may be extended to matrices over R as follows. Let M \u2208 Rn\u00d7m\nand define M \u2217 to be the matrix with each entry u of M replaced by u\u2217 . Then define M \u2217 = M \u2217T .\nThis matrix M \u2217 has size m \u00d7 n. Let A(z) be a matrix with polynomial in variables z over some ring\nwith involution \u2217 . Define A(z)\u2217 to be A\u2217 (z\u22121 ). When A is used for A(z) write A\u2217 to mean A(z)\u2217 . (In\nother words consider 'complex conjugate transposed' of a variable z to be z \u22121 ; this is consistent with\ngroup/group ring considerations.)\nLet R be a ring with involution \u2217 . For w(z) \u2208 R[z] define w(z)\u2217 = w\u2217 (z\u22121 ). Say w(z) is a paraunitary\nelement in R[z] (relative to \u2217 ) if and only if w(z)w\u2217 (z\u22121 ) = w(z)w(z)\u2217 = 1.\nSuppose K = (B1 , B2 , . . . , Bk ) and L = (C1 , C2 , . . . , Ck ) are rows of blocks of a matrix P where\neach block is of the same size. Then define the block inner product of K and L, written K * L, to be\nK * L = B1 C1\u2217 + B2 C2\u2217 + . . . + Bk Ck\u2217 . This is to include the case when Bi , Cj are polynomial matrices\nand the Cj\u2217 are defined as above.\n\n3\n\nParaunitary elements\n\nThe building methods using complete sets of orthogonal idempotents for the 1D paraunitary matrices in\nthis section are generalised later in section 5 below and following. The next section 4 considers methods\nfor designing such complete sets of orthogonal idempotents.\n2\n\n\fProposition 3.1 Let I = {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek } be a complete orthogonal set of idempotents in a ring R.\nk\nX\nDefine u(z) =\n\u00b1ei z ti . Then u(z)u(z \u22121) = 1.\ni=1\n\nProof: Since {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek } is a complete set of orthogonal idempotents, u(z)u(z \u22121 ) = e21 +e22 +. . .+e2k =\ne1 + e2 + . . . + ek = 1.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.1 If I is symmetric then u(z)u\u2217 (z \u22121 ) = 1.\nThus u(z) is a paraunitary element when I is a symmetric orthogonal complete set of idempotents.\nIt is not necessary to use primitive idempotents. Note also that if S = {e1 , . . . , ek } is a complete set\nof orthogonal idempotents then {ei , ej }, i 6= j, may be replaced by {ei + ej } in S and the result is (still)\na complete set of orthogonal idempotents. This idea may be used to obtain real paraunitary matrices\nfrom (complex) complete orthogonal sets of idempotents in group rings.\nWe single out the case R = Fn\u00d7n for special mention.\nProposition 3.2 Let {I1 , I2 , . . . , Ik } be a complete symmetric set of orthogonal idempotents in the ring\nPk\nFn\u00d7n of (n \u00d7 n) matrices over F . Then W (z) = i=1 \u00b1Ii z ti is a paraunitary 1D n \u00d7 n matrix over F\nwhere the ti are non-negative integers.\nIn the group ring case a paraunitary element in F G with |G| = n gives a paraunitary matrix in Fn\u00d7n\nvia the embedding of F G into Fn\u00d7n as given for example in [11].\nSuppose {I1 , I2 , . . . , Ik } is an orthogonal symmetric complete set of idempotents in Fn\u00d7n and that P\nis a unitary matrix. Then also {P \u2217 I1 P, P \u2217 I2 P, . . . , P \u2217 Ik P } is a symmetric complete orthogonal set of\nidempotents in Fn\u00d7n .\nFor our purposes say a paraunitary matrix P is separable if it can be written in the form P = QR or\nP = Q \u2297 R where Q, R are paraunitary with Q 6= 1, R 6= 1; otherwise say P is non-separable.\nThe following standard lemma is included for completeness and is not needed subsequently; the proof\nis omitted.\nLemma 3.1 Suppose A(z) is a paraunitary matrix. Then A\u2217 (z) and AT (z) are paraunitary matrices.\n\n3.1\n\nModulus 1\n\nIn Proposition 3.1 the coefficients of the idempotents are \u00b11 times monomials. This can be extended in\nC to coefficients with modulus 1 times monomials. In R and fields of finite characteristic define a\u2217 = a\nand then \u00b11 are the only elements which satisfy aa\u2217 = a2 = 1.\nSuppose {E1 , E2 . . . . , Ek } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents in Fn\u00d7n . Define\nW (z) = \u03b11 E1 z t1 +\u03b12 E2 z t2 +. . .+\u03b1k Ek z tk and then W \u2217 (z \u22121 ) = \u03b11 \u2217 E1 z \u2212t1 +\u03b12 \u2217 E2 z \u2212t2 +. . .+\u03b1k \u2217 Ek z \u2212tk .\nHere if a \u2208 C, then a\u2217 = a, the complex conjugate of a, and for other fields a\u2217 = a. Use |a|2 to mean\naa\u2217 for any field.\nTherefore W (z)W \u2217 (z \u22121 ) = W (z)W (z)\u2217 = |\u03b11 |2 E1 + |\u03b12 |2 E2 + . . . + |\u03b1k |2 Ek\n(**).\nProposition 3.3 W (z) is a paraunitary matrix if and only if |\u03b1i |2 = 1 for each i.\nProof: If each |\u03b1i |2 = 1 then from (**) W (z)W \u2217 (z \u22121 ) = 1. If on the other hand W (z)W \u2217 (z \u22121 ) = 1\nthen multiplying (**) through (on right) by Ei gives |\u03b1i |2 Ei = Ei from which it follows that |\u03b1i |2 = 1.\n\u0003\nThus Proposition 3.1 may be generalised as follows:\nProposition 3.4 Let {E1 , E2 , . . . , Ek } be a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents and W (z) =\n\u03b11 E1 z t1 + \u03b12 E2 z t2 + . . . + \u03b1k Ek z tk , with tj \u2265 0 and |\u03b1j |2 = 1 for each j. Then W (z) is a paraunitary\nmatrix.\n\u221a\nNow in C, |\u03b1|2 = 1 if and only if \u03b1 = ei\u03b8 for real \u03b8 with i = \u22121 and in R, |\u03b1|2 = 1 if and only if\n\u03b1 = \u00b11. In a field of characteristic p, |\u03b1|2 = \u03b12 = 1 if and only if \u03b1 = 1 or \u03b1 = \u22121 = p \u2212 1.\n3\n\n\fAs expected unitary matrices are built from complete symmetric orthogonal sets of matrices as per\nProposition 3.4:\nProposition 3.5 U is a unitary n \u00d7 n matrix over C if and only if U = \u03b11 v1\u2217 v1 + \u03b12 v2\u2217 v1 + . . . + \u03b1n vn\u2217 vn\nwhere {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } is an orthonormal basis for Cn and \u03b1i \u2208 C, |\u03b1i | = 1, \u2200i. Further the \u03b1i are the\neigenvalues of U .\nProof: Suppose U = \u03b11 v1\u2217 v1 + \u03b12 v2\u2217 v1 + . . . + \u03b1n vn\u2217 vn with {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } an orthonormal basis and\n|\u03b1i | = 1. Then U vi\u2217 = \u03b1i vi\u2217 and so the \u03b1i are the eigenvalues of U . It follows from Proposition 3.4 that\nU is unitary since {v1\u2217 v1 , v2\u2217 v2 , . . . , vn\u2217 vn } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents.\nSuppose then U is a unitary matrix. It is known that there exists\uf8eba unitary\nmatrix P such that\n\uf8f6\nv1\nv2\n\n\u2217\n\nU = P DP where D is diagonal with entries of modulus 1.

Thus further paraunitary matrices may be designed using these products from those already\nconstructed .\n\n4\n\nComplete orthogonal sets of idempotents\n\nParaunitary matrices are designed from complete symmetric sets of orthogonal idempotents in section 3\nand also in later sections. Here we concentrate on how such sets may be constructed.\n\n4.1\n\nSystems from orthonormal bases\n\nLet V = F n . Assume F n has an inner product so that the notion of orthonormal basis exists in V\nand its subspaces. In Rn and Cn the inner product is vu\u2217 for row vectors v, u where \u2217 denotes complex\nconjugate transpose; in Rn , w\u2217 = wT , the transpose of w.\n\n4\n\n\fSuppose now V = V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Vk is any direct decomposition of V . Let Pi denote the projection\nof V to Vi . Then Pi is a linear transformation on V and (i) 1 = P1 + P2 + . . . + Pk ; (ii) Pi2 = Pi ; (iii)\nPi Pj = 0, i 6= j.\nThus {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pk } is complete orthogonal set of idempotents. If each Pi is an orthogonal projection\nthen this set is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents.\nThe matrix of Pi may be obtained as follows when Pi is an orthogonal projection. Let {w1 , w2 , . . . , ws }\nbe an orthonormal basis for Vi and consider w \u2208 V . Then w = vi + \u0175 where \u0175 \u2208 V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 . . . V\u0302i . . . \u2295 Vk\nand vi \u2208 Vi . Here V\u0302i means omitting that term. Then Pi : V \u2192 Vi is given by w 7\u2192 vi . Now\nvi = \u03b11 w1 + \u03b12 w2 + . . . + \u03b1k wk . Take the inner product with wj to get \u03b1j = vi wj\u2217 = wwj\u2217 . Hence\nPi : w 7\u2192 w(w1\u2217 w1 + w2\u2217 w2 + . . . + ws\u2217 ws ). Thus the matrix of Pi is w1\u2217 w1 + w2\u2217 w2 + . . . + ws\u2217 ws .\nOn the other hand suppose {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pk } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents\nin Fn\u00d7n . Then Pi defines a linear map V \u2192 V by Pi : v 7\u2192 vPi . Let Vi denote the image of Pi . Then it\nis easy to check that V = V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Vk .\nThe case when each Vi has dimension 1 is worth looking at separately. Suppose {o1 , o2 , . . . , on } is\nan orthonormal basis for F n . Such bases come up naturally in unitary matrices. Let Pi denote the\nprojection of F n to the space generated by oi . Then P = {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn } is an orthogonal symmetric\ncomplete set of idempotents in the space of linear transformations of F n . It is easy to obtain the matrices\nof Pi . The matrices Pi may be combined and the resulting set is (still) a complete symmetric orthogonal\nsets of idempotents. For example (Pi + Pj ) (i 6= j) is still idempotent and is the projection of F n to the\nspace generated by {oi , oj }; replace {Pi , Pj } by (Pi + Pj ) in P and the new set is (still) an orthogonal\nsymmetric complete set of idempotents. Then rank(Pi + Pj ) = rank(Pi ) + rank(Pj ) also \u2013 see Lemma\n9.1 below.\nFor example {v1 = 13 (2, 1, 2), v2 = 31 (1, 2, \u22122), v3 = 13 (2, \u22122, \u22121)} is an orthonormal basis for R3 .\n\u00104 2 4\u0011\n\u0010 1 2 \u22122 \u0011\nThe projection matrices are respectively P1 = v1 T v1 = 91 2 1 2 , P2 = v2 T v2 = 19 2 4 \u22124 , P3 =\n424\n\u22122 \u22124 4\n\u0010 4 \u22124 \u22122 \u0011\nv3 T v3 = 19 \u22124 4 2 .\n\u22122 2\n\n1\n\nThus {P1 , P2 , P3 } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents and each Pi has rank 1.\nSet P\u03022 = P2 + P3 and then {P1 , P\u03022 } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents also and\nrank(P\u03022 ) = 2.\nNote that the inner product in Cn is vu\u2217 for row vectors v, u where \u2217 denotes complex conjugate\ntransposed. For example { \u221a12 (\u2212i, 1), \u221a12 (i, 1)} is an orthonormal basis for C2 . Projecting then gives the\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1 i\ncomplete orthogonal symmetric set of idempotents {P1 = 12 1i \u2212i\n1 , P2 = 2 \u2212i 1 }.\n\n4.2\n\nOrthogonal idempotents systems from unitary/paraunitary\n\nLet U be a unitary or paraunitary n \u00d7 n matrix in variables z say over R. Then the rows {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }\nof U satisfy vi vi\u2217 = 1, vi vj\u2217 = 0, i 6= j.\nDefine Pi = vi\u2217 vi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then Pi is an n \u00d7 n matrix of rank 1.\nProposition 4.1 {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents in Rn\u00d7n [z, z\u22121 ].\nProof: It is easy to check that Pi\u2217 = Pi , Pi Pi = Pi , Pi Pj = 0, i 6= j. It is necessary to show that the set\nis complete.\nLet A = P1 + P2 + . . . + Pn . Note that Pi vi\u2217 = vi\u2217 , Pi vj\u2217 = 0, i 6= j. Then Avi\u2217 = vi\u2217 . Thus A has n\nlinearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. Hence A = In .\n\u0003\n4.2.1\n\nDiagonals\n\nIn Rn\u00d7n let Eii denote the matrix with 1 = 1R on the (diagonal) (i, i) position and 0 elsewhere. Then\nW = {E11 , E22 , . . . , Enn } is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotent matrices. This is a\nspecial case of section 4.1 but is worth mentioning separately; paraunitary matrices have been designed\nfrom W which, although not generally useful in themselves directly, may be combined with other designed\nparaunitary matrices with which they do not commute in general.\n\n5\n\n\f4.3\n\nGroup rings\n\nGroup rings are a neat way with which to obtain complete orthogonal symmetric sets of idempotents.\nThese systems haveP\nnice structures from which properties of the paraunitary matrices designed may be\ndeduced. Let w = g\u2208G \u03b1g g be an element in the group ring F G and W denotes the matrix of w as\ndefined in [11] and [9]. This matrix W depends on the listing of the elements of G and relative to this\nlisting \u03c6 : w 7\u2192 W is an embedding\nPof F G into the ring of n \u00d7 n matrices, Fn\u00d7n , over F where n = |G|.\nThe transpose, wT , of w is wT = g\u2208G \u03b1g g \u22121 . Note that the matrix of wT is then W T .\nP\nOver C define w\u2217 = g\u2208G \u03b1g g \u22121 where bar denotes complex conjugate. Note then that for a group\nring element w with corresponding matrix W the matrix of w\u2217 is indeed W \u2217 .\nSay an element w(z) \u2208 F G[z] is a paraunitary group ring element if and only if w(z)w\u2217 (z\u22121 ) = 1 and\nthis happens if and only if the corresponding W (z) \u2208 Fn\u00d7n [z] is a paraunitary matrix (where n = |G|).\nThe W (z) obtained from w(z) in this case is termed a group ring paraunitary matrix.\nGroup rings are a rich source of complete sets of orthogonal idempotents and group rings have a rich\nstructure within which properties of the paraunitary matrices so designed may be obtained.\nThe theory brings representation theory and character theory in group rings into play. The orthogonal\nidempotents are obtained from the conjugacy classes and character tables, see e.g. [4]. The orthogonal\nsets of idempotents depend on the field under consideration and classes of paraunitary matrices over\ndifferent fields such as Q, R or finite fields are also obtainable.\nP\n\u22121\n)g\nThe primitive central idempotents of the complex group algebra CG are given by e(\u03c7) = \u03c7(1)\ng\u2208G \u03c7(g\n|G|\nwhere \u03c7 runs through the irreducible (complex) characters \u03c7 of G, see [4], Theorem 5.1.11 page 185,\nP\ni (1)\n\u22121\nwhere the ei are expressed as ei = \u03c7|G|\n)g.\ng\u2208G \u03c7i (g\nThe idempotents from group rings are automatically symmetric.\n\nTheorem 4.1 For the group idempotents ei , e\u2217i = ei .\nProof: This is a matter of showing that the coefficients g and g \u22121 in each ei are complex conjugates of\none another. But this is immediate as it is well-known that \u03c7(g \u22121 ) = \u03c7(g), and thus the result follows\nfrom the expression for ei given above.\n\u0003\nLet Ei denote the matrix of ei as per an embedding of the group ring into the ring of matrices as for\nexample in [11].\nCorollary 4.1 Let {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek } be a complete set of orthogonal idempotents in a group ring and define\nk\nX\nU (z) =\n\u00b1Ei z ti where the ti are non-negative integers. Then U (z) is a paraunitary matrix.\ni=1\n\nCorollary 4.2 Let {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek } be a complete set of orthogonal idempotents in a group ring over C\nk\nX\n\u03b1i Ei z ti where the ti are non-negative integers and |\u03b1i | = 1. Then U (z) is a\nand define U (z) =\nparaunitary matrix.\n\ni=1\n\nThe formula for the {ei } as given above (taken from [4]) may be used to construct complete orthogonal sets of idempotents. The Computer Algebra packages GAP and Magma can construct character\ntables and conjugacy classes from which complete sets of orthogonal idempotents in group rings may be\nobtained. The literature contains other numerous methods for finding complete (symmetric) orthogonal\nsets of idempotents in group rings.\nIn general the paraunitary matrices designed using orthogonal sets of idempotents in the group ring\nover C have complex coefficients but specialising and combining idempotents allows the design so that\nthe coefficients may be in R, the real numbers, or in Q, the rational numbers. When the group ring of\nthe symmetric group Sn is used the paraunitary matrices derived by these methods all have coefficients\nautomatically in Q and when the group ring of dihedral group D2n is used the coefficients are in R. In\ngeneral idempotents occur in complex conjugate pairs and these may be combined to give real coefficients\nresulting in paraunitary matrices with real coefficients.\nMost of the results hold in the case when the characteristic of F does not divide the order of G; in\nthis case this means that the characteristic of F does not divide the size n of the (n \u00d7 n) matrices under\n6\n\n\fconsideration. In these cases also it may be necessary to extend the field to include roots of certain\npolynomials.\n\n4.4\n\nTensor products\n\nIt is easy to check that the tensor product of paraunitary matrices is also a paraunitary matrix. If\nP = QR, S = T V then P \u2297 S = (QT ) \u2297 (RS) when the products QT, RS can be formed.\nComplete orthogonal sets of idempotents may be designed using products of these sets. Suppose\n{e0 , e2 , . . . , ek } is a complete orthogonal set of idempotents in Fn\u00d7n and {f0 , f1 , . . . , fs } is a complete\northogonal set of idempotents in Fk\u00d7k . Then {ei \u2297 fj | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s} is a complete orthogonal set\nof idempotents in Fnk\u00d7nk . Here \u2297 denotes tensor product. If both {e0 , e2 , . . . , ek } and {f0 , f1 , . . . , fs }\nare symmetric then so is the resulting tensor product set. The details are omitted.\nIf {ei | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k} and {fj | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s} are complete orthogonal sets of idempotents within group\nrings F G, F H respectively then {ei fj | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s} is a complete orthogonal set of matrices in\nF (G \u00d7 H). Suppose ei 7\u2192 Ei , fj 7\u2192 Fj gives an embedding into matrices, then ei fj 7\u2192 Ei \u2297 Fj gives an\nembedding into F (G \u00d7 H); this may be deduced from [11] and details are omitted.\n\n4.5\n\nExamples of paraunitary matrix from orthonormal bases\n\n\u00104 2 4\u0011\n\u0010 1 2 \u22122 \u0011\n1.

These rows may then be used to form a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents\nfrom which paraunitary matrices may be constructed. This process could be continued.\n\n3.

Give values of modulus 1 to z in Q(z) above and get a unitary matrix R. Use the rows of R to\nform a further complete symmetric set of idempotents from which paraunitary matrices may be\nformed.\n5. Combine Q(z) in 3. with W (z) in 1. to give for example the paraunitary matrix Q(z)W (z)Q(z).\nWe give some examples from orthogonal sets of idempotents derived from group rings. The group ring idea\nis used later as a prototype in which to extend the method for the design of non-separable paraunitary\nmatrices. The complete orthogonal sets of idempotents obtained from group rings are automatically\nsymmetric as noted in Theorem 4.1.\nRecall that circ(a0 , a1 , . . . , an\u22121 ) denotes the circulant n \u00d7 n matrix with first row (a0 , a1 , . . . , an\u22121 ).\nConsider CCn where Cn is a cyclic group of order n.\n1. When n = 2 the (primitive) orthogonal set of idempotents consists of {e0 = 1/2(1+g),\n\u0012 e1 = 1/2(1\u2212\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\nand\ng)}, where g generates C2 . Thus paraunitary matrices may be formed from E0 = 2\n1 1\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1 \u22121\n1+z 1\u2212z\ngiving for example 21\n.

These may be combined with paraunitary matrices formed from E11 =\n, E22 =\n.\n0 0\n0 1\nNote that E11 , E22 do not commute with E0 , E1 . For example the following is a paraunitary matrix:\n\n7\n\n\f\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 z\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\nz + z2\nz \u2212 z2\n\nz \u2212 z2\nz + z2\n\n\u0013\u0012 2\nz\n0\n\n0\nz3\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012 2\nz + z3\nz2 \u2212 z3\n\nz2 \u2212 z3\nz2 + z3\n\n\u0013\n\nThey may also be combined\n\u0001 matrices formed from orthonormal bases as in section\n\u0001 with paraunitary\n1\n1 i\n}.\n,\nP\n=\n4.1 such as {P1 = 21 1i \u2212i\n2\n\u2212i\n1\n1\n2\n\nThe determinant of these matrices which are powers of z may be obtained from Theorem 9.2 below.\n3. The primitive orthogonal idempotents for a cyclic group are related to the Fourier Matrix.\n\n4. In CC4 , for example, the orthogonal primitive idempotents are e1 = 14 (1 + a + a2 + a3 ), e2 =\n1\n1\n1\n2 2\n3 3\n2\n3\n3\n2 2\n3\n4 (1 + \u03c9a + \u03c9 a + \u03c9 a ), e3 = 4 (1 \u2212 a + a \u2212 a ), e4 = 4 (1 + \u03c9 a + \u03c9 a + \u03c9a ) from which 4 \u00d7 4\nth\nparaunitary matrices may be constructed. Here \u03c9 is a primitive 4 root of unity and in this case\n\u03c9 2 = \u22121.\nNotice that ei = ei T as could be deduced from Theorem 4.1.\n\n5. Combine the ei to get real sets of orthogonal idempotents. Note that it is simply enough to combine\nthe conjugacy classes of g and g \u22121 . In this case then we get\n\u00ea1 = e1 = 14 (1 + a + a2 + a3 ), \u00ea2 = e2 + e4 = 21 (1 \u2212 a2 ), \u00ea3 = e3 = 14 (1 \u2212 a + a2 \u2212 a3 ), which can\nthen be used to construct real paraunitary 4 \u00d7 4 matrices.\n6. Using C2 \u00d7C2 gives different paraunitary matrices. Here the set of primitive orthogonal idempotents\nconsists of f1 = 41 (1 + a + b + ab), f2 = 41 (1 \u2212 a + b \u2212 ab), f3 = 14 (1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab), f4 = 41 (1 + a \u2212 b \u2212 ab)\nand the paraunitary matrices derived are all real.\n7. The paraunitary matrices produced from C4 from C2 \u00d7 C2 and from E11 , E22 , E33 , E44 may then\nbe combined to produce further (4 \u00d7 4) paraunitary matrices. So for example the following 4 \u00d7 4\nis a paraunitary matrix:\n(E1 + E2 z + E3 z 3 + E4 z 2 )(E11 + E22 z + E33 z 3 + E44 z 2 )(F1 z + F2 z 2 + F3 z 3 + F4 z 2 )\nAgain the determinant of the matrix may be obtained from Theorem 9.2.\nThe Ei , Fj are derived from the ei , fj (as per [11]) so for example E2 =\n\u0012 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 \u0013\n\u22121 1 1 \u22121\n1\n\u22121 1 1 \u22121 .\n4\n\n1\n4\n\ncirc(1, \u03c9, \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 3 ), F3 =\n\n1 \u22121 \u22121 1\n\n4.6\n\nGet real\n\nBy combining complex conjugate idempotents in a complete orthogonal sets of complex idempotents,\nreal paraunitary matrices may be obtained. We illustrate this with an example.\nSuppose {e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 , e5 } is the complete set of primitive idempotents in CC6 . Here then ei =\n1\n(1\n+ \u03c9 i g + \u03c9 2i g 2 + \u03c9 3i g 3 + \u03c9 4i g 4 + \u03c9 5i g 5 ) where \u03c9 = e2i\u03c0/6 is a primitive 6th root of unity and C6 is\n6\ngenerated by g.\nThen e0 = e0 , e1 = e5 , e2 = e4 , e3 = e3 .\nLet \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/6. Note that cos(\u03b8) = cos(5\u03b8), cos(2\u03b8) = cos(4\u03b8). Now combine e1 with e5 and e2 with\ne4 to get e\u02c61 = 26 (1 + cos(\u03b8)g + cos(2\u03b8)g 2 + cos(3\u03b8)g 3 + cos(4\u03b8)g 4 + cos(5\u03b8)g 5 ) and e\u02c62 = 62 (1 + cos(2\u03b8)g +\ncos(2\u03b8)g 2 )+cos(2\u03b8)g 3 +cos(2\u03b8)g 4 +cos(2\u03b8)g 5 . This gives the real orthogonal complete set of idempotents\n{e0 , e\u02c61 , e\u02c62 , e3 } from which real paraunitary matrices may be constructed. The ranks of the idempotents\nand determinants of the paraunitary matrices formed may be deduced from Lemma 9.1 and Theorem\n9.2.\n\n4.7\n\nSymmetric, dihedral groups\n\nLet D2n denote the dihedral group of order 2n. As every element in D2n is conjugate to its inverse, the\ncomplex characters of D2n are real. Thus the paraunitary matrices obtained directly from the complete\n\n8\n\n\forthogonal set of idempotents in CD2n have real coefficients. The characters D2n are contained in an\nextension of Q of degree \u03c6(n)/2 and this is Q only for 2n \u2264 6.\nLet Sn denote the symmetric group of order n. Representations and orthogonal idempotents of\nthe symmetric group are known; see for example [8]. The characters of Sn are rational and thus the\nparaunitary matrices produced directly from the complete orthogonal set of idempotents in CSn have\nrational coefficients.\nThe paraunitary matrices formed from different group rings (with same size group) may be combined\nto form further paraunitary matrices; these in general will not commute.\nWe present an example here from S3 , the symmetric group on 3 letters. (Note that S3 = D6 .)\nNow S3 = {1, (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2)} where these are cycles. We also use this listing of\nS3 when constructing matrices.\nThere are three conjugacy classes: K1 = {1}; K2 = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}, (2, 3); K3 = {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2)}.\nDefine\n\u00ea1 = 1 + (1, 2) + (1, 3) + (2, 3) + (1, 2, 3) + (1, 3, 2),\n\u00ea2 = 1 \u2212 {(1, 2) + (1, 3) + (2, 3)} + (1, 2, 3) + (1, 3, 2),\n\u00ea3 = 2 \u2212 {(1, 2, 3) + (1, 3, 2)},\nand e1 = 16 \u00ea1 ; e2 = 61 \u00ea2 ; e3 = 13 \u00ea3 . Then {e1 , e2 , e3 } form a complete orthogonal set of idempotents\nand may be used to construct paraunitary matrices.\n\uf8eb 1 (12) (13) (23) (123) (132) \uf8f6\n\uf8ec\nThe G-matrix of S3 (see [11]) is \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(23)\n(132)\n(123)\n\n1\n(123)\n(132)\n(23)\n(13)\n\n(132)\n1\n(123)\n(12)\n(23)\n\n(123)\n(132)\n1\n(13)\n(21)\n\n(23)\n(12)\n(13)\n1\n(132)\n\nThus the matrices of e1 , e2 , e3 are respectively\n\n(13)\n(23) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(12) \uf8f8 .\n(123)\n1\n\n\uf8eb1 1 1 1 1 1\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1 1 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2 0 0 0 \u22121 \u22121 \uf8f6\n\u22121 1 1 1 \u22121 \u22121\n0 2 \u22121 \u22121 0 0\n1\n1 \uf8ed \u22121\n1 \uf8ed 11 11 11 11 11 11 \uf8f8\n1 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 \uf8f8\n2 \u22121 0 0 \uf8f8\n, E3 = \uf8ed 00 \u22121\n.\n, E2 =\nE1 =\n11111 1\n\u22121 1 1 1 \u22121 \u22121\n\u22121 2 0 0\n6 111111\n6\n3 \u22121 \u22121\n1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1 1\n0 0 0 2 \u22121\n11111 1\n\n1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 1\n\n1\n\n\u22121 0\n\n0\n\n0 \u22121 2\n\nNote that E1 , E2 have rank 1 and that E3 has rank 4; the proof for the ranks of these Ei in general\nis contained in Lemma 9.1.\nThus for example the following are paraunitary matrices:\nE2 + E1 z + E3 z 2 , E3 + (E1 + E2 )z, E1 + E2 + E3 z 2 .\nThe paraunitary matrices formed from these idempotent matrices may then be combined with paraunitary matrices formed using complete orthogonal idempotents obtained from CC6 and ones using\n{E11 , E22 , E33 , E44 , E55 , E66 }.\nP6\nP3\nLet {f1 , . . . , f6 } be the orthogonal idempotents from CC6 . Let w1 = i=1 Ei z ti , w2 = i=1 Eii z ki , w3 =\nP6\nli\ni=1 Fi z . (Fi is the matrix of fi .) Then products of w1 , w2 , w3 are paraunitary matrices.

Then QA = Q and hence A = 1.\nNote that in the above we do not need to take the square root of elements.\nAnother way could be to construct such sets over Q and when the denominators do not involve a\nprime dividing the order of the field it is then possible to derive complete symmetric orthogonal sets of\nidempotents over the finite field.\n\u00104 2 4\u0011\nFor example the complete orthogonal symmetric systems of idempotents P1 = 19 2 1 2 , P2 =\n4 24\n\u0010 1 2 \u22122 \u0011\n\u0010 4 \u22124 \u22122 \u0011\n1\n1\n2 4 \u22124 , P3 =\n\u22124 4 2\nwere obtained in section 4.1.\n9 \u22122 \u22124 4\n9 \u22122 2 1\n\u00100 0 0\u0011 \u00101 0 0\u0011 \u00100 0 0\u0011\nOver a field of characteristic 2 these come to the trivial set { 0 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 } of symmetric\n000\n000\n001\ncomplete orthogonal set of idempotents.\n\u00101 3 1\u0011 \u00104 3 2\u0011 \u00101 4 2\u0011\nOver the field F5 of 5 elements they become (note that here 9\u22121 = 4): { 3 4 3 , 3 1 4 , 4 1 3 }.\n131\n\n2 41\n\n2 34\n\nThis is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents in F5 which may be checked independently.\nThe following are complete symmetric orthogonal sets of idempotents over F7 :\n\u00102 1 2\u0011 \u00104 1 6\u0011 \u00102 5 6\u0011\n\u00106 5 6\u0011 \u00105 2 5\u0011 \u00104 0 3\u0011\n{ 1 4 1 , 1 2 5 , 5 2 1 }, { 5 3 5 , 2 5 2 , 0 0 0 }.\n2 12\n\n6 52\n\n6 14\n\n6 56\n\n52 5\n\n30 4\n\nThese different sets may be used to construct paraunitary matrices over F7 and in a later section are\nused to show how to construct as an example a non-separable paraunitary matrix over a finite field.\n\n4.9\n\n1D building blocks\n\nThe great factorisation theorem of Belevitch and Vaidyanathan, see [7] (pp. 302-322), is that matrices\nof the form H(z) = 1 \u2212 vv \u2217 + zvv \u2217 , where v is any unit column vector (v \u2217 v = 1), are the building blocks\nfor 1D paraunitary matrices over C.\nConsider F1 = vv \u2217 where v is a unit column vector and so v \u2217 v = 1. Thus F1 F1 = vv \u2217 vv \u2217 = vv \u2217 = F1\nand so F1 is an idempotent. Hence {F1 = vv \u2217 , F2 = 1\u2212F1 = 1\u2212vv \u2217 } is a complete symmetric orthogonal\nset of these (two) idempotents with rank F1 = 1 and rank F2 = (n \u2212 1) where the matrices have size\nn \u00d7 n; see Theorem 9.1 below for rank result. Then H(z) = F2 + zF1 and hence the paraunitary 1D\nmatrices are built from complete symmetric orthogonal sets of two idempotents, one of which has rank 1\nand the other has rank(n \u2212 1).\nProposition 4.2 Let F be a field in which every element has a square root. Suppose also an involution\nis defined on the set of matrices over F . Then P is a symmetric (with respect to \u2217 ) idempotent of\nrank 1 in Fn\u00d7n if and only if P = vv \u2217 where v is a column vector such that v \u2217 v = 1.\n\u2217\n\n(Note that 'symmetric with respect to \u2217 ' in the case of C in which \u2217 denotes complex conjugate\ntransposed is normally termed 'Hermitian'.)\nProof: If P = vv \u2217 with v \u2217 v = 1 then P is a symmetric idempotent of rank 1.\nSuppose P is a symmetric idempotent of rank 1 in Fn\u00d7n . Since P has rank 1 each row is a multiple\nof any non-zero row. Suppose the first row is non-zero and that the first entry of this row is non-zero.\nProofs for other cases are similar. Since P is symmetric it has the form\n\uf8eb b1 b2 ... bn \uf8f6\n\u2217\nb\u2217 b2 b\u2217\n2 /b1 ... bn b2 /b1\n\u2217\nb2 b\u2217\n/b\n...\nb\nb\n1\nn\n3\n3 /b1\n\n\uf8ec b2\u2217\n3\nP =\uf8ec\n\uf8ed .\n..\n\u2217\n\n..\n.\n\n..\n.\n\n..\n.\n\n\u2217\nbn b2 b\u2217\nn /b1 ... bn bn /b1\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nwith b\u22171 = b1 .\nSince P is idempotent it follows that b21 + |b2 |2 + . . . + |bn |2 = b1 .\nLet v = \u221a1b (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn )\u2217 .

For example P = ( 21 12 ) over F3 is a symmetric\nidempotent matrix of rank 1 but cannot be written in the form vv T ; however 2 does not have a square\nroot in F3 . Note that P1 = 1 \u2212 P = ( 22 22 ) and that {P, P1 } is a complete orthogonal set of idempotents\nin (F3 )2\u00d72 .\nOver F3 the following complete symmetric sets of idempotents are the building blocks for 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrices: {( 21 12 ) , ( 22 22 )}, {( 10 00 ) , ( 00 01 )}. Thus the paraunitary matrices 2 \u00d7 2 matrices over F3 are built\nfrom these sets using Proposition 3.4 and products. These sets are not of Belevitch and Vaidyanathan\nform and their result does not apply here.\nThe 1D building block result of Belevitch and Vaidyanathan cannot be extended to multidimensions.\nGroup ring 1D paraunitary matrices and other 1D paraunitary matrices over C constructed here can\nin theory then be obtained from this characterisation. Group rings have special features and paraunitary\nmatrices from these have nice structures.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nMultidimensional\nkD with idempotents\n\nProposition 5.1 Let {E1 , E2 , . . . , Et } be a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents and deQk\nt\nfine products of non-negative powers of variables by wi (z) = \u00b1 j=1 zji,j for i = 1, 2, . . . , t where\nPt\nz = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zk ) and ti,j are non-negative integers.

Define W (z) = ti=1 wi (z)Ei and then\nW (z) is a paraunitary matrix.\nThe W (z) so formed can be combined using products of matrices, or tensor products of matrices\nwhen appropriate, to form further paraunitary matrices.\nSuch paraunitary matrices formed from Propositions 5.1 and 5.2 can however be shown to be separable\nbut have uses of their own and will be used later to form (constituents of) non-separable paraunitary\nmatrices.\n\n5.2\n\nExamples of 2D paraunitary\n\nRecall that if u is a group ring element of F G with |G| = n then U (capital letter equivalent) denotes\nthe matrix of u under the embedding of F G into the ring Fn\u00d7n of n \u00d7 n matrices over F , see [11].\nLet {e0 , e1 , e2 } be a (primitive) orthogonal complete set of idempotents in CC3 , and thus {E0 , E1 , E2 }\nis an orthogonal complete symmetric set of idempotents in C3\u00d73 .

However here u(z, y) = (e0 + e1 z + e2 z 2 )(f0 + f1 y + f2y 2 + f3 y 3 )\nand so U (z, y) is separable.\nLet u(z, y) = (e0 +e1 z +e2 z 2 )f0 +(e0 +e1 z 2 +e2 z)f1 y +(e0 z +e1 +e2 z 2 )f2 y 2 +(e0 z +e1 z 3 +e2 z 2 )f3 y 3 .\nThen U (z, y) is a paraunitary matrix.\n\n11\n\n\f6\n\nMatrices of idempotents\n\nParaunitary matrices may also be constructed from matrices with blocks of complete orthogonal sets of\nidempotents.\n\u0001\n1 \u22121\nConsider the following example.

Arrange these\ninto a k \u00d7 k block matrix of with each row of blocks containing one of the blocks {E0 , E1 , . . . , Ek } exactly\nonce. Now attach monomials to each Ei ; the same monomial need not be used with each Ei that appears.\nLet W be the resulting matrix.\nTheorem 6.1 W is a paraunitary matrix.\nProof: Take the block inner product of two different rows of blocks. The Ei are orthogonal to one\nanother so the result is 0. Take the block inner product of any row of blocks with itself. This gives\nE12 + E22 + . . . + Ek2 = E1 + E2 + . . . + Ek = 1(= In ). Hence W W \u2217 = 1(= Ink ).\n\u0003\nThe W is a paraunitary matrix in the union of the variables of the monomials.\nThe condition that each row and column block contains each Ei once and once only can be obtained\nby using the group ring matrix of any group of order k; see for example [11]. So for example the Ei could\nbe arranged as a circulant block of matrices. Different arrangements will in general give inequivalent\n12\n\n\fparaunitary matrices.\n(Modifications in the construction of W by attaching elements of modulus 1 as coefficients will give\nparaunitary matrices but further conditions are necessary on these elements.These modifications are not\nincluded here.)\nThese are nice constructions for paraunitary matrices but can be shown to be separable. However they\nhave uses in themselves and will prove useful later as parts of constructions of non-separable paraunitary\nmatrices. They may also be used to construct special and regular types of Hadamard real and complex\nmatrices. These are illustrated in the following sections 6.2 and 6.3.\n\n6.2\n\nMonomials and Hadamard regular matrices\n\nAlthough the matrices of idempotents as constructed in sections 6 and 6.1 produce separable paraunitary\nmatrices these can be useful structures in themselves; they may also be used in certain cases to produce\n'regular' Hadamard matrices. (Walsh-Hadamard matrices are regular Hadamard matrices which have\nbeen used extensively in communications' theory.) If in a paraunitary matrix the entries are \u00b11 times\nmonomials in the variables then substituting \u00b11 for the variable gives a Hadamard matrix. If in a\nparaunitary matrix the entries are \u03c9 times monomials where \u03c9 is a complex number of modulus 1 then\nsubstituting each variable by a complex number of modulus 1 gives a complex Hadamard matrix.\n2\n2\nFor example use P0 = circ(1, 1, 1), P1 =\n\uf8eb circ(1, \u03c9, \u03c9 ), P2\uf8f6= circ(1, \u03c9 , \u03c9) where \u03c9 is a primitive third\nxP0 yP1 zP2\nroot of unity gives the following matrix: \uf8ed zP2 xP0 yP1 \uf8f8.\nyP1 zP2 xP0\nSubstituting a complex number of modulus 1 for each of x, y, z gives a complex Hadamard matrix.\nButson-type Hadamard matrices H(q, n) are complex Hadamard n \u00d7 n matrices with entries which\nare q th roots of unity.\nWith the above example substituting a third root of unity for the variables gives a Hadamard H(3, 9)\nmatrix, that is a a matrix H with entries which are third roots of unity so that HH \u2217 = 9. These matrices\ncould then be used to produce Hadamard H(3, 36) matrices.\nThis can be extended to q \u00d7 q matrices using the complete orthogonal set of idempotents for the cyclic\ngroup of order q; this will involve q th roots of unity and is related to the representation theory of the\nfinite cyclic group. From this Hadamard H(q, q 2 ) matrices can be produced and from these Hadamard\nH(q, (2q)2 ) matrices can be produced and so on.\n\n6.3\n\nMixing\n\nIt is noted that interchanging rows and/or columns in a paraunitary matrix results in a paraunitary\nmatrix and thus interchanging blocks of rows and/or columns results in a paraunitary matrix. When\nusing complete orthogonal sets of idempotents the blocks of row and/or columns of idempotents can be\ninterchanged in the construction stage. The resulting paraunitary matrices can take a regular form. In\ncertain cases the variables can be specialised to form regular Hadamard matrices. Here examples are\ngiven but details of the constructions are omitted.\nLet {E0 , E1 } be a complete symmetric orthogonal\nset of idempotents in Cn\u00d7n .

By varying the signs other constructions of paraunitary matrices are obtained and\nthese are not generally equivalent to one another.\n\n13\n\n\fThey may seem to be non-separable but by interchanging blocks of rows and blocks of columns it can\nbe shown that they are separable.

Values of modulus 1 may be given to to the variables in W and with the fraction\nomitted a regular complex Hadamard matrix is obtained. Other group ring structures can also arise in\nthis manner.\nWalsh-Hadamard matrices have the structure of the group ring of C2n . These examples may also be\nextended in a similar way. So for example constructions with the structure of the group ring C8 \u00d7 C2 \u00d7 G\nmay be made if paraunitary matrices with the structure of G can be formed such as when G = C4n or\nwhen G = (C2 \u00d7 C2 )n and others.\n\n7\n\nNon-separable constructions\n\nSeveral methods have now been developed for constructing multidimensional paraunitary methods from\ncomplete orthogonal sets of matrices. The matrices produced are useful in many ways but are found to\nbe separable although not appearing so initially. The methods use just one complete orthogonal set of\nidempotents in the various constructions.\nThus we are led to consider different complete orthogonal sets of variables and to 'tangle' them up\nin order to construct non-separable paraunitary matrices.\n\n7.1\n\nA general construction\n\nProposition 7.1 Let A, B be paraunitary matrices of the same size\n\u0012 but not\u0013necessarily with\n\u0012 the same\n\u0013\nA\nB\nA A\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nvariables over a field in which 2 has a square root.

The result holds in general over any field which contains the square root\nof 2.\n\u0001\n1\nIf A = B then W in Proposition 7.1 is the tensor product A \u2297 J where J = 11 \u22121\n.

These may\nthen be input to algorithm of section 7.4.\n\n8\n\nPseudo-paraunitary\n\nLet P be a paraunitary n \u00d7 n matrix with variables z over a field F . Then the rows {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } of P\nsatisfy vi vi\u2217 = 1 and vi vj\u2217 = 0 for i 6= j. Note that v \u2217 means transpose conjugate over C, and transpose\nover other fields, with the understanding that z \u2217 = z \u22121 , {z \u22121 }\u2217 = z for a variable z.\nLet Pi = vi\u2217 vi which are n \u00d7 n matrices of rank 1 and involve the variables {z, z\u22121 }. Then\n{P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn } is a complete orthogonal symmetric set of idempotents in the polynomial ring Fn\u00d7n [z, z\u22121 ].\nHence by the methods of Sections 4, 6, 5 and 7 paraunitary-type matrices may be formed; for the method\nof Section 7 two such sets must be constructed. For example W = w1 P1 + w2 P2 + . . . + wn Pn in variables\nw = (w1 , w2 , . . . , wn ) satisfies W W \u2217 = 1. Now W is a matrix in the variables (z, z\u22121 , w) but cannot be\ntermed paraunitary. Call such a matrix a pseudo-paraunitary matrix. Having constructed W its rows\nmay then be used to construct further pseudo-paraunitary matrices and so on.\nThus say W (z, z\u22121 ) \u2208 Fn\u00d7n [z, z\u22121 ] is a pseudo-paraunitary matrix if W W \u2217 = 1. Pseudo-paraunitary\nmatrices may be constructed from paraunitary matrices and from pseudo-paraunitary matrices.\nHere's an example.\n\u0001\n1 \u22121\n1. Form E0 = 12 ( 11 11 ) , E1 = 21 \u22121\n1 .\nx+y x\u2212y \u0001\n2. Form P = xE0 + yE1 = 12 x\u2212y\nx+y\n3. Let v1 = 21 (x + y, x \u2212 y), v2 = 12 (x \u2212 y, x + y).\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\ny+y \u22121 x y \u22121 x\u2212x\u22121 y\n, P2 = v2\u2217 v2 =\n4. Form P1 = v1\u2217 v1 = 41 2+x\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nx y\u2212y x 2\u2212x y\u2212y x\n5. Pi Pi = Pi , P1 P2 = 0 and P1 + P2 = 1. Form W = zP1 + tP2 .\n\n1\n4\n\n\u0010\n\n2\u2212x\u22121 y\u2212y \u22121 x y \u22121 x\u2212x\u22121 y\nx\u22121 y\u2212y \u22121 x 2+x\u22121 y+y \u22121 x\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n6. W = W (x, y, x\u22121 , y \u22121 , z, t), and W W \u2217 = 1.\n7. The rows of W can be used to form further pseudo-paraunitary matrices.\nConsider P1 , P2 as in this example above. Define Q1 = xyP1 , Q2 = xyP2 . Define Q = zQ1 + tQ2 .\nThen Q \u2208 F2\u00d72 [x, y, x, t], and is a polynomial with QQ\u2217 = x2 y 2 I2 .\nSay W \u2208 Fn\u00d7n [z] is a pseudo-paraunitary matrix over Fn\u00d7n [z] if W W \u2217 = pIn where p is a monomial\nin z. A pseudo-paraunitary matrix over Fn\u00d7n [z, z\u22121 ] may be used to construct a pseudo-paraunitary\nmatrix over Fn\u00d7n [z] and vice versa.\nPseudo-paraunitary matrices in general may be constructed from paraunitary matrices and from\npseudo-paraunitary matrices.\n\n9\n\nDeterminants and rank\n\nHere we consider properties of complete sets of idempotent matrices and ranks of the idempotents.\nLemma 9.1 Suppose {E1 , E2 , . . . , Es } is a set of orthogonal idempotent matrices. Then rank(E1 + E2 +\n. . . + Es ) = tr(E1 + E2 + . . . + Es ) = trE1 + trE2 + . . . + trEs = rank E1 + rank E2 + . . . + rank Es .\nProof: It is known that rank A = trA for an idempotent matrix, see for example [2], and so rank Ei =\ntrEi for each i. If {E, F, G} is a set an orthogonal idempotent matrices so is {E + F, G}. From\nthis it follows that rank(E1 + E2 + . . . + Es ) = tr(E1 + E2 + . . . Es ) = trE1 + trE2 + . . . + trEs =\nrank E1 + rank E2 + . . . rank Es .\n\u0003\n19\n\n\fCorollary 9.1 rank(Ei1 + Ei2 + . . . + Eik ) = rank Ei1 + rank Ei2 + . . . + rank Eik for ij \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , s},\nand ij 6= il for j 6= l.\nLet {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek } be a complete orthogonal set of idempotents in a vector space over F .\nTheorem 9.1 Let w = \u03b11 e1 + \u03b12 e2 + . . . + \u03b1k ek with \u03b1i \u2208 F . Then w is invertible if and only if each\n\u03b1i 6= 0 and in this case w\u22121 = \u03b111 e1 + \u03b112 e2 + . . . + \u03b11k ek .\nProof: Suppose each \u03b1i 6= 0. Then w( \u03b110 e0 + \u03b111 e1 +. . .+ \u03b11k ek ) = e20 +e21 +. . .+e2k = e0 +e1 +. . .+ek = 1.\n\nSuppose w is invertible and that some \u03b1i = 0. Then wei = 0 and so w is a (non-zero) zero-divisor\nand is not invertible.\n\u0003\nWe now specialise the ei to be n \u00d7 n matrices and in this case use capital letters and let ei = Ei .\nLet A = a1 E1 + a2 E2 + . . . + ak Ek . Then A is invertible if and only if each ai 6= 0 and in this case\nA\u22121 = a11 E1 + a12 E2 + . . . + a1k Ek .\nTheorem 9.2 Suppose E1 , E2 , . . . , Ek is a complete symmetric orthogonal set of idempotents in Fn\u00d7n .\nLet A = a1 E1 +a2 E2 +. . .+ak Ek with ai \u2208 F . Then the determinant of A is |A| = a1rank E1 a2rank E2 . . . akrank Ek .\nProof: Now AEi = ai Ei2 = ai Ei . Thus each column of Ei is an eigenvector of A corresponding to\nthe eigenvalue ai . Thus there are at exist rank Ei linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to\nthe eigenvalue ai . Since rank E1 + rank E2 + . . . + rank Ek = n, there are exactly rank Ei linearly\nindependent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue ai . Let ri = rank Ei . Let these ri linearly\nindependent eigenvectors corresponding to ai be denoted by vi,1 , vi,2 , . . . vi,ri . Do this for each i.\nAny column of Ei is perpendicular to any column of Ej for i 6= j as Ei Ej\u2217 = 0.\nP r1\nP r2\nP rk\nSuppose now j=1\n\u03b11,j v1,rj + j=1\n\u03b12,j v2,rj + . . . + j=1\n\u03b1k,j = 0.\nP rk\nMultiply through by Es for 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k. This gives j=1 \u03b1k,j vk,j = 0 from which it follows that\n\u03b1k,j = 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . rk .\nThus the set of vectors S = {v1,1 , v1,2 , . . . v1,r1 , v2,1 , v2,2 , . . . , v2,r2 . . . , . . . , vk,1 , vk,2 , . . . , vk,rk } is linearly independent and form a basis for F n \u2013 remember that rank(E1 + E2 + . . . + Ek ) = n. Hence A\ncan be diagonalised by the matrix of these vectors and thus there is a non-singular matrix P such that\nP \u22121 AP = D where D is a diagonal matrix consisting of the ai repeated ri times for each i = 1, 2, . . . k.\nHence |A| = |D| = ar11 ar22 . . . arkk .\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
