An approach to the calculation of local canonical morphic heights is described, motivated by the analogy between the\nclassical height in Diophantine geometry and entropy in algebraic\ndynamics. We consider cases where the local morphic height is\nexpressed as an integral average of the logarithmic distance to the\nclosure of the periodic points of the underlying morphism. The\nresults may be thought of as a kind of morphic Jensen formula.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet \u03c6 : P1 (Q) \u2192 P1 (Q) be a morphism of degree d, defined over the\nrationals. Call, Goldstine and Silverman (see [3],[4]) have associated to\n\u03c6 a canonical global morphic height \u03bb\u0302\u03c6 on Q, with the properties that\n1. \u03bb\u0302\u03c6 (\u03c6(q)) = d\u03bb\u0302\u03c6 (q) for any q \u2208 P1 (Q);\n2. q is pre-periodic if and only if \u03bb\u0302\u03c6 (q) = 0.\nA point q is called pre-periodic under \u03c6 if the orbit {\u03c6(n) (q)} is finite\n(write f (n) for the nth iterate of a map f ). The global height decomposes into a sum of local canonical morphic heights \u03bb\u03c6,v :\n\u03bb\u0302\u03c6 (q) =\n\nX\n\nnv \u03bb\u03c6,v (q).\n\nv\n\nHere v runs over all the valuations (both finite and infinite) of the number field generated by q and the nv denote the usual normalising constants. In the special case that \u03c6 takes the form \u03c6[x, y] = [y d f (x/y), y d]\nfor a polynomial f of degree d, Call and Goldstine [3] prove that\n1\n\u03bb\u03c6,v (q) = lim n \u03bbv (\u03c6(n) (q)),\n(1)\nn\u2192\u221e d\nwhere \u03bbv is the local projective height \u03bbv (q) = log+ |q|v , and that the\nlocal height \u03bb\u03c6,v (q) vanishes if and only if |\u03c6(n) (q)|v is bounded for all\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11S05, 37F10.\nThe first author acknowledges the support of EPSRC postdoctoral award\nGR/M49588, the second thanks Jonathan Lubin and Joe Silverman for the AMS\nSectional meeting on Arithmetic Dynamics at Providence, RI, 1999.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM.

Here the canonical\nmorphic heights and the projective heights agree. Jensen's formula ([13, Theorem 15.18]) gives\nZ\n\nS1\n\nlog |y \u2212 q|dm(y) = log+ |q|,\n\nwhere m is the Haar measure on the circle S1 . The circle is also\nthe Julia set for this morphism on C, and it is the closure of the\nset of non-zero periodic points, which are all roots of unity. In\nthe p-adic case, the Julia set is empty but it is still true that the\nlocal height is the Shnirel'man integral of the logarithmic distance\nfrom the closure of the set of periodic points. For all v, finite and\ninfinite, the following holds:\nX\n1\nlog+ |q|v = lim n\nlog |\u03b6 \u2212 q|v\nn\u2192\u221e d\nn \u22121\nd\n\u03b66=q:\u03b6\n=1\nFor finite v this may be seen, for instance, using Section 3. Alternatively, it follows from the Diophantine estimate\nn\n\n|q d \u2212 q|v > C(q)|n|v\nprovided the left hand side is non-zero (cf. Remark 3.6). For v|\u221e\na result from transcendence theory (in this case, Baker's theorem)\nis needed.\n2. Suppose a, b \u2208 Q with 4a3 + 27b2 6= 0 and let\nz 4 \u2212 2az 2 \u2212 8bz + a2\n.\nz 3 + az + b\nThen f gives rise to a morphism of degree 4 which describes the\nduplication map on an elliptic curve. The global and local morphic\nheights coincide with the usual notions of height on the curve.\nFor the infinite valuations, the local height is again the integral\naverage of the logarithmic distance to points on the Julia set,\nwhich is the closure of the set of periodic points. At the singular\nreduction primes it is still true that the local height is the integral\naverage of the logarithmic distance to the periodic points. Both\nof these assertions are proved in [6] where this morphism was used\nto construct a dynamical system which interprets these heights in\ndynamical terms. The proofs require elliptic transcendence theory\nto show that a rational point cannot approximate a periodic point\ntoo closely (cf. Proposition 3.8). This is part of a much broader\nf (z) =\n\n\fMORPHIC HEIGHTS AND PERIODIC POINTS\n\n3\n\nanalogy between heights in Diophantine geometry and entropy in\nalgebraic dynamics (see [5], [6], [7], [10]).\nIn this paper, our purpose is to describe a family of examples where\nthe local canonical morphic height can be expressed as a limiting integral over periodic points of the underlying morphism. The finite and\ninfinite cases require different approaches. In both, we consider the special class of morphisms corresponding to affine polynomial maps and\nin the former case, we assume good reduction in the sense of Morton\nand Silverman [12].\nThere are two directions in which this work can be made more sophisticated that are not pursued here. The first is to give a more formal\ninterpretation of the limiting process using Shnirel'man integrals (see\n[14], or [8] for a modern treatment); the second is to extend the arguments to other morphisms.\n2. Complex case\nAssume that \u03c6 : P1 (C) \u2192 P1 (C) is a morphism of degree d, with\n\u03c6[x, y] = [y d f (x/y), y d] for a polynomial f of degree d. For basic definitions of complex dynamics, consult [1]. The following theorem expresses the local morphic height as an integral over the Julia set J(f )\nof the polynomial f , and standard results from complex dynamics show\nthat this is in turn a limiting integral over periodic points.\nTheorem 2.1. If f (z) = az d + * * * + a0 is a polynomial, then for any\nq \u2208 C,\nZ\n1\n\u03bb\u03c6,\u221e (q) =\nlog |a| +\nlog |x \u2212 q|dm(x),\n(3)\nd\u22121\nJ(f )\nwhere m is the maximal invariant measure for f on J(f ).\nProof. Assume first that q is in the domain of attraction of \u221e for\nf . The zeros of the polynomial fn (x) = f (n) (x) \u2212 x are precisely the\nsolutions of the equation f (n) (x) = x. Note that dn = deg(fn ) = dn ,\nwhere d = deg(f ). Since |f (n) (q)| \u2192 \u221e, d1n log |fn (q)| is approximately\n1\nlog |f (n) (q)|, which converges to \u03bb\u03c6,\u221e (q). Since q lies in the open\ndn\nFatou set, log |x \u2212 q| is continuous on J(f ). Now\n1\n1\nlog |fn (q)| =\ndn\ndn\n\nX\n\nlog |x \u2212 q| +\n\nf (n) (x)=x\n\n1\nlog |Bn |,\ndn\n\nwhere the sum is over the nth 'division points' and\n2 +***+d(n\u22121)\n\nBn = a1+d+d\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\n\nM. EINSIEDLER, G. EVEREST, AND T. WARD\n\nis the leading coefficient of f (n) (x). Thus\n1\n1\nlog |Bn | = n\ndn\nd\n\n1\ndn \u2212 1\nlog |a| \u2192\nlog |a|.\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\n!\n\n(5)\n\nNow it is known that\nZ\nX\n1\nlog |x \u2212 q|dm(x),\nlog |x \u2212 q| \u2192\ndn f (n) (x)=x\nJ(f )\nwhere m is the maximal invariant measure for f restricted to the Julia\nset (see [11]; [9]).\nIn the following it is convenient to assume that a=1, we can ensure\nQ\nthis by conjugating by a linear map. Now |x \u2212 f (q)| = f (t)=x |t \u2212 q|,\nso\nZ\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |x \u2212 f (q)|dm(x) =\n\nZ\n\nJ(f )\n\n= d\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nlog |t \u2212 q|dm(x)\n\nf (t)=x\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |x \u2212 q|dm(x)\n\n(6)\n\n(the last equality follows from [11] or [9, Theorem (d)]).\nLet now q \u2208\n/ J(f ) have bounded orbit. Since J(f ) is closed, we can\nfind \u01eb > 0 such that B\u01eb (q) \u2229 J(f ) = \u2205. If |f n (q) \u2212 q| > \u01eb/2 for almost\nall n, then\n1\nlog |f n (q) \u2212 q| \u2192 0.\ndn\nWe can argue as in the first case to get\nZ\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |x \u2212 q| = 0 = \u03bb\u03c6,\u221e (q).\n\nAssume now |f nj (q) \u2212 q| \u2264 \u01eb/2 for some sequence nj \u2192 \u221e. Then\n|f nj (q) \u2212 x| > \u01eb/2 for x \u2208 J(f ). However, since J(f ) and f nj (q) are\nbounded, we have also an upper bound\nZ\n\u01eb\nlog \u2264\nlog |x \u2212 f nj (q)| \u2264 M.\n2\nJ(f )\nTogether with Equation (6) we get\n\u01eb Z\nnj\nlog |x \u2212 q| \u2264 1/dnj M\n1/d log \u2264\n2\nJ(f )\nwhich concludes the proof in this case.\nIt remains to show that the formula holds for q \u2208 J(f ). Since J(f )\nhas no interior, there is a sequence qn \u2192 q with qn \u2208\n/ J(f ). Then\nlog |x \u2212 qn | \u2192 log |x \u2212 q| for all x \u2208 J(f )\\{q}. Since J(f ) is bounded,\n\n\fMORPHIC HEIGHTS AND PERIODIC POINTS\n\n5\n\nlog |x \u2212 qn | and log |x \u2212 q| are uniformly bounded above by M say for\nx \u2208 J(f )\\{q}. So by Fatou's lemma\n0 = lim\n\nZ\n\nn\u2192\u221e J(f )\n\nlog |x \u2212 qn |dm(x) \u2264\n\nZ\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |x \u2212 q|dm(x) \u2264 M.\n(7)\n\nThis shows that x 7\u2192 log |x \u2212 q| is in L1 (m). If\nZ\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |x \u2212 q|dm(x) > 0,\n\nthen Equation (6) contradicts (7).\n3. The p-adic case\nLet Cp denote the usual completion of the algebraic closure of the\np-adic numbers Qp , and use | * | to denote the extension of the padic norm to Cp . Write Op for the ring of integral elements in Cp ,\nand P for the maximal ideal of Op . In this section we assume that\n\u03c6 : P1 (Cp ) \u2192 P1 (Cp ) is a morphism of degree d corresponding to an\naffine polynomial f of degree d with coefficients in Op and leading\ncoefficient in Op\u2217 . Notice that these assumptions are, for polynomials,\nequivalent to the assumption that the map \u03c6 has good reduction in the\nsense of [12]: \u03c6 induces a morphism of schemes over Spec(Op ). The\nJulia set is empty in this setting (see [2], [12]), so a direct analogue of\n(3) is not possible.\nThe main result expresses the local canonical morphic height as a\nlimiting integral over periodic points for the polynomial f .\nTheorem 3.1. If \u03c6 has good reduction and is defined by a polynomial\nf of degree d, then\nX\n1\n\u03bb\u03c6,p (q) = log+ |q| = lim n\nlog |\u03be \u2212 q|\nn\u2192\u221e d\n(n)\n\u03be6=q:f (\u03be)=\u03be\nwhere the sum is taken with multiplicities.\nNotice first that for q \u2208 Cp \\Op this is clear, so from now on we\nassume that q \u2208 Op . Despite the simple resulting value of the height,\nthe convergence involved requires an argument. The main issue is to\nproduce lower bounds on the size of |\u03be \u2212 \u03b6| for distinct periodic points\n\u03be and \u03b6.\nThe least period of a periodic point \u03be is the cardinality of the orbit of\n\u03be. The points of period n are the solutions to the polynomial equation\nf (n) (x) \u2212 x = 0,\n\n(8)\n\nand are therefore all elements of Op . Following [12], for a periodic\npoint \u03be define an (\u03be) to be the multiplicity of \u03be in (8), with the obvious\n\n\f6\n\nM. EINSIEDLER, G. EVEREST, AND T. WARD\n\nconvention that \u03be has multiplicity zero in an equation that it does not\nsatisfy. Notice that an (\u03be) 6= 0 if and only if n is a multiple of the least\nperiod of \u03be. Define a\u2217n (\u03be) by\nX \u0012n\u0013\na\u2217n (\u03be) =\n\u03bc\nan (\u03be),\nd\nd|n\nwhere \u03bc is the M\u00f6bius function. Increases in the multiplicity of the\nperiodic point \u03be along the sequence of multiples of its least period are\nrecorded by a\u2217n (\u03be). The periodic point \u03be is an essential n-periodic point\nif a\u2217n (\u03be) > 0.\nThe following proposition is a special case of [12, Prop. 3.2].\nProposition 3.2. Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p \u2265 0, and f a polynomial over K with degree d \u2265 2. Fix a periodic\npoint \u03b6 \u2208 K with least period m, and let r denote the multiplicative\norder of (f (m) )\u2032 (\u03b6) in K \u2217 or \u221e if (f (m) )\u2032 is not a root of unity. Then\nfor n \u2265 1, a\u2217n (\u03b6) \u2265 1 if and only if one of the following conditions hold.\n1. n = m;\n2. n = mr;\n3. p > 0 and n = pe mr for some e \u2265 1.\nWhen K = Cp , this proposition will also be applied to the polynomial f \u0304 induced by reduction mod P. Notice that the sum of the\nmultiplicities of the points of period n under f lying in one residue\nclass gives the multiplicity of the image point as a point of period n\nunder f \u0304.\nFor the proof of Theorem 3.1 the following proposition is needed;\nthis will be proved later.\nProposition 3.3. Suppose \u03be is a periodic point with least period n for\na polynomial f of good reduction. Then for any fixed q \u2208 Op , |q\u2212\u03be| \u2192 1\nas n \u2192 \u221e, provided q 6= \u03be.\nProof. (of Theorem 3.1) By Proposition 3.2 applied to the field Cp with\ncharacteristic zero, if \u03be is a periodic point with least period m, then the\nmultiplicity of \u03be viewed as a periodic point of period m, 2m, 3m, . . . is\nuniformly bounded. Fix q \u2208 Op and s \u2208 (0, 1). Proposition 3.3 says\nthat the number of periodic points in the metric ball Ds (q) is finite. It\nfollows that\nX\n1\nlim\ninf\nlog |\u03be \u2212 q| \u2265 log s.\nn\u2192\u221e dn\n\u03be6=q:f (n) (\u03be)=\u03be\nOn the other hand, each term in the sum is non-positive, so letting\ns \u2192 1 proves the theorem.\n\n\fMORPHIC HEIGHTS AND PERIODIC POINTS\n\n7\n\nAll that remains is to prove Proposition 3.3, for which we need some\nlemmas.\nLemma 3.4. Assume that f (0) = 0, and let \u03b6 be a periodic point of\nf . Then |\u03b6| = |f (n) (\u03b6)| for all n \u2265 1.\nProof. The spherical metric used in [12] coincides with the usual metric\nin Op , and f has good reduction. So by [12, Prop. 5.2],\n|f (x) \u2212 f (y)| \u2264 |x \u2212 y|\nfor x, y \u2208 Op . The lemma follows at once.\nLemma 3.5. Assume that f (0) = 0 and n > 1 is fixed.\nQ\n\u2217\n1. If |f \u2032 (0)| < 1 then \u03be6=0 |\u03be|an (\u03be) = 1. (\nQ\n\u2217\n1/p if n is a power of p,\n2. If |f \u2032 (0)\u22121| < p\u22121 then \u03be6=0 |\u03be|an (\u03be) =\n1 if not.\nProof. In case 1., f \u0304\u2032 (0) = 0 in the algebraically closed field Op /P, so\nProposition 3.2 may be applied with \u03b6 = 0 + P, m = 1 and r = \u221e. It\nfollows that for n > 1 a\u2217n (0 + P) = 0, so there cannot be an essential\nn-periodic point \u03be for f with |\u03be| < 1.\nIn case 2., m = 1 and r = 1 for the point \u03b6 = 0 + P in Proposition\n3.2. It follows that only values of n of the form pk are relevant. Notice\nthat\nk\n\nY\n\n\u03be6=0\n\n|\u03be|\n\na\u2217k (\u03be)\np\n\n=\n\nf (p ) (x) \u2212 x\nf (pk\u22121 ) (x) \u2212 x\n\n!\n\n(9)\nx=0\n\nIf f \u2032 (0) 6= 1, then the right-hand side of (9) is given by\nk\n\n1\n(f \u2032(0))p \u2212 1\n=\nk\u22121\n\u2032\np\np\n(f (0))\n\u22121\nby the binomial theorem. If f \u2032 (0) = 1, write f (x) = x + xe g(x) with\ne > 1 and g(0) 6= 0, then a simple induction argument shows that\nf (k) (x) = x + kxe g(x) + O(x2e\u22121 ).\nIt follows that (9) is equal to p again.\nProof. (of Proposition 3.3) Let \u03b6 be any periodic point, with least period l. The first step is to prove the proposition for q = \u03b6. Let \u03be\nhave least period n under f . The multiplicity of \u03b6 + P, which has\nleast period m for some m|l must increase at l (because a\u2217l (\u03b6) > 1). It\nfollows by Proposition 3.2 that l is equal to m, mr, or mrpe for some\n\n\f8\n\nM. EINSIEDLER, G. EVEREST, AND T. WARD\n\ne \u2265 1. Assume first that n is not of one of those forms; then |\u03be \u2212 \u03b6| = 1\nbecause the multiplicity of \u03b6 + P cannot increase at n in Op /P.\nIn the remaining cases, we may assume for large n that l|n. Then\n\u03be is a periodic point with least period n/l under f (l) . Applying the\nconjugation x 7\u2192 x \u2212 \u03b6 means that 0 is a fixed point of g, where\ng(x) = f (l) (x + \u03b6) \u2212 \u03b6.\nIf |g \u2032(0)| < 1, then by Lemma 3.5 applied to g, |\u03be \u2212 \u03b6| = 1.\nIf |g \u2032(0)| = 1, let t be the order of g \u2032 (0) + P in Op /P. Then\n|(g \u2032(0))t \u2212 1| < 1.\nThere exists a c \u2265 1 such that\nc\n\n|(g \u2032(0))tp \u2212 1| < 1/p.\nAs before, we may assume that tpc |n, so Lemma 3.5 may be applied to\nc\nthe map h = g (tp ) to give\nY\n\n|h(j) (\u03be \u2212 \u03b6)| \u2265 1/p.\n\nj=1,...,n/tpc l\nc\n\nIt follows by Lemma 3.4 that |\u03be \u2212 \u03b6| \u2265 p\u2212tp l/n . Since t, c, l depend\nonly on \u03b6, |\u03be \u2212 \u03b6| \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e. The ultrametric inequality in Cp\nnow gives the result for any q \u2208 Op .\nRemark 3.6. Notice that the discussion above also gives a quantitative version of Proposition 3.3. This Diophantine result may be of\nindependent interest. If f is a polynomial of good reduction, then\n|f (n) (q) \u2212 q| > C(f, q)|n|\nfor all n \u2265 1, provided the left hand side is non-zero.\nExample 3.7. To see the different cases that are possible in Proposition 3.3, consider the following examples.\n1. Let f (x) = g(xp ) + ph(x) be a monic polynomial with coefficients\nin Op . Then |f \u2032(q)| < 1 for any q \u2208 Op , so in Lemma 3.5 only the\nfirst case is ever used. It follows that in Proposition 3.3, |\u03b6 \u2212\u03be| = 1\nfor any distinct periodic points \u03b6, \u03be.\n2. Let f (x) = x2 \u2212 (1 + a)x for some small a. Then 0 is a fixed point,\nand |f \u2032 (0)| = 1. Now\nf (2) (x) \u2212 x = x4 \u2212 (2a + 2)x3 + (a2 + a)x2 + (a2 + 2a)x,\nso (f (2) (x) \u2212x)/(f (x) \u2212x) has constant term (a2 + 2a)/(\u2212a\u22122) =\n\u2212a. Therefore there must be two non-zero points of period 2 that\nare close to the fixed point 0.\n\n\fMORPHIC HEIGHTS AND PERIODIC POINTS\n\n9\n\nIf the polynomial f has coefficients outside Op , then in contrast to\nProposition 3.3, there may be sequences of periodic points converging to a periodic point. For example, f (x) = x2 + 12 x on C2 has this\nproperty. Therefore, to recover Theorem 3.1 in greater generality (for\npolynomials of bad reduction or rational functions) some kind of Diophantine approximation results are needed. In Example 1.1.2 these\ntools are provided by elliptic transcendence theory.\nProposition 3.8. Let \u03b6 be a periodic point with least period l under\nf . Assume that |(f (l) )\u2032 (\u03b6)| > 1. Then there are periodic points \u03be 6= \u03b6\narbitrarily close to \u03b6.\nProof. Define g = f (l) and a = (f (l) )\u2032 (\u03b6). Without loss of generality\nwe can assume that \u03b6 = 0. Then\ng(x) = ax + bxe + O(xe+1 ) with b 6= 0\nand\ng (2) (x) = a2 x + (ab + ae b)xe + O(xe+1).\nDefine b2 = (ab + ae b), then |b2 | = |b||a|e . By induction one can see\nthat\ng (k) (x) = ak x + bk xe + O(xe+1 )\nwith |bk | = |b||a|ke.\nTherefore the Newton polygon of g (k) (x) \u2212 x starts with a line with\nslope s \u2264 \u2212k + c for a fixed c (depending on b and e). So there exists\na periodic point \u03be with |\u03be| = ps \u2264 p\u2212k+c .\n4. Tchebycheff polynomials\nExample 4.1. Consider the Tchebycheff polynomial of degree d, f (z) =\nTd (z) = cos(d arccos(z)). The Julia set is the interval J(f ) = [\u22121, 1].\nThe map \u03c6 : C \u2192 C given by \u03c6(z) = 21 (z + z \u22121 ) is a semi-conjugacy\nfrom g : z 7\u2192 z d onto z 7\u2192 f (z), in other words, f (\u03c6(z)) = \u03c6(z d ). Write\n\u03c8 for the branch of the inverse of \u03c6 defined on {z \u2208 C | |z| > 1}. The\ncanonical morphic height at the infinite place is (for q \u2208\n/ J(f ))\n1\n\u03bb\u03c6,\u221e (q) = lim n log+ |f (n) (q)|\nn\u2192\u221e d\n1\n= lim n log+ |\u03c6g (n)\u03c8(q)|\nn\u2192\u221e d\n!\n1\n1\n+ 1\n(n)\ng \u03c8(q) + (n)\n|\n= lim n log |\nn\u2192\u221e d\n2\ng \u03c8(q)\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n(n)\n= lim max 0, n log |g \u03c8(q)|\nn\u2192\u221e\nd\n+\n= log |\u03c8(q)|.\n\n\f10\n\nM. EINSIEDLER, G. EVEREST, AND T. WARD\n\nFor q \u2208 J(f ), the same formula holds since \u03bb\u03c6,\u221e (q) = 0 there by [3]\nand log+ |\u03c8(q)| = 0 there by a direct calculation.\nNow by Jensen's formula, for any q \u2208 C,\nlog+ |\u03c8(q)| = log 2 +\n= log 2 +\n\nZ\n\nZS\n\n1\n\n|\u03c6(y) \u2212 q|dy\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |t \u2212 q|dm(t)\n\nsince m is the image under \u03c6 of the maximal measure (Lebesgue) on\nthe circle. That is,\n\u03bb\u03c6,\u221e (q) = log 2 +\n\nZ\n\nJ(f )\n\nlog |t \u2212 q|dm(t).\n\n(10)\n\nThe constant log 2 in \u03bb\u221e (q) may be explained in accordance with\n1\nlog |a| in this\nTheorem 2.1. The leading coefficient of Td is 2d\u22121 , so d\u22121\ncase is exactly log 2.\nA similar approach can be adopted in the case of polynomials with\nconnected Julia sets. There the local conjugacy near \u221e extends to the\nwhole domain of attraction of \u221e, which is the complement of the filled\nJulia set.\nExample 4.2. As before, let f (x) = Td (x) = cos(d arccos(x)) be the\nTchebycheff polynomial of degree d and let \u03c6 be the corresponding\nmorphism. We would like to use Theorem 3.1, but f does not satisfy\nthe assumptions since it is not monic.\nLet g(x) = 2f ( x2 ). Notice that f is defined uniquely by the property\nf ( 21 (z + z \u22121 )) = 21 (z d + z \u2212d ). It follows that g is characterized by the\nproperty g(z + z \u22121 ) = (z d + z \u2212d ), which shows that g \u2208 Z[x] is a monic\npolynomial. Let \u03c8 be the morphism defined by g, then by Theorem\n3.1 we have for q \u2208 Cp\nX\n1\n\u03bb\u03c8,p (q) = log+ |q| = lim n\nlog |\u03be \u2212 q|.\n(11)\nn\u2192\u221e d\n(n)\n\u03be6=q:g (\u03be)=\u03be\nSince g(x) = 2f ( x2 ), we have that \u03bb\u03c6,p (q) = \u03bb\u03c8,p (2q) and on the right\nhand side of (11) that f (n) (\u03be) = \u03be if and only if g (n) (2\u03be) = 2\u03be. Therefore\nX\n1\n\u03bb\u03c6,p (q) = log+ |2q| = log |2| + lim n\nlog |\u03be \u2212 q|,\nn\u2192\u221e d\n\u03be6=q:f (n) (\u03be)=\u03be\nwhich is again analogous to Equation (10) in Example 4.1.\nExample 4.2 works because the Tchebycheff polynomial can be conjugated to a polynomial of good reduction; a similar approach can be\nadopted for any polynomial that is conjugate to one of good reduction.\n\n\fMORPHIC HEIGHTS AND PERIODIC POINTS\n\n11\n\nReferences\n1.
