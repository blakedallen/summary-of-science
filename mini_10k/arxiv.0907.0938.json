In the present work, we focus on\nbootstrap percolation on hyperbolic lattices obtained by regular tilings of the hyperbolic\n(negatively curved) plane. Bootstrap percolation (BP) with blocking parameter m is defined\nby the following deterministic evolution: starting from a configuration in which each lattice\nsite is independently occupied with a given probability \u03c1, occupied sites are emptied if\nF.

A site is said blocked for the initial\nconfiguration if it is occupied in the corresponding final configuration. We investigate the\noccurrence and the properties of infinite clusters of blocked sites when varying the initial\ndensity \u03c1.\nThis study has both mathematical and physical motivations. Concerning the former, it\nconnects to the series of studies on phase transitions on \"nonamenable graphs\" [25, 41, 7],\nnonamenability being a notion that informally speaking refers to graphs with a nonvanishing\nsurface (boundary) to volume (bulk) ratio. On the more physical side, it is driven by a line of\nresearch on phenomena such as glass and jamming transitions in liquids and related systems.\nThere is an admittedly long route from BP on hyperbolic lattices to glassforming liquids,\nand the (heuristic) connection that goes through notions such as \"geometric frustration\"\nin condensed matter and schematic descriptions of slow dynamics in terms of \"kinetically\nconstrained models\" will be discussed in more detail below.\nWe show that, for a large choice of tilings and blocking parameters, there is a nontrivial\ncritical density 0 < \u03c1c < 1 such that infinite clusters of blocked sites only occur when the\ndensity \u03c1 of the occupied sites of the initial configuration satisfies \u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1c . Although we\nresort to rather casual physicists' language in the present article, the proof is rigorous and\nwill be presented with due formalism and rigor in a subsequent publication [51]. Furthermore we present strong evidence that this transition has a discontinuous order parameter: the\nprobability that a given site is blocked displays a jump at \u03c1c . Similarly to its counterpart on\ntree-like structures such as Bethe lattices and random graphs of constant connectivity [21,\n42], this transition has features of both first-order and second-order phase transitions, namely\na discontinuity in the order parameter and a diverging correlation length.\nNote that there could be another percolation threshold at a higher density \u03c1u > \u03c1c such\nthat for \u03c1c < \u03c1 < \u03c1u there is an infinite number of disconnected (infinite) clusters of blocked\nsites with a unique cluster occurring only above \u03c1u . This second transition indeed occurs\nfor site percolation on hyperbolic lattices and nonamenable graphs [9, 23, 24]. It also takes\nplace for BP on Cayley trees and in this case it can be thought of as a boundary-induced\nphenomenon. We do not investigate this aspect for BP on hyperbolic lattices since it is of\nless interest in the context of glassforming systems.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we outline the arguments that support\nthe possible relevance of BP on hyperbolic lattices to the study of glass and jamming transitions and we establish the connection between BP and kinetically constrained models for\nglassy dynamics. In section 3, we give basic information concerning the hyperbolic plane\nand hyperbolic lattices and we recall how one can construct appropriate trees embedded in\nthe hyperbolic lattices. Section 4 contains the main analytical result, i.e. the existence of\na BP transition on hyperbolic lattices, and a sketch of the proof while section 5 contains\nour results concerning the order of the transition. The latter are obtained by combining analytical results on Cayley trees, conjectures on the effect of boundary conditions for BP on\nnonamenable graphs and a numerical study. Finally, we give some concluding remarks, and\na more technical point is discussed in the appendix.\n\n\f3\n\n2 Glass transition, kinetically constrained models and hyperbolic plane\n2.1 Glass formation and geometric frustration\nAs already mentioned, one motivation for the present study comes from phenomena associated with glass and jamming transitions. The glass transition of liquids, colloids and polymers refers to the formation under cooling or compressing of an amorphous phase which\ncan no longer flow on the observation time scale and then appears as a solid. A related phenomenon exists in dense granular assemblies and in foams as these systems get clogged or\njammed when the external drive that made them move and flow becomes too small.\nAmong the numerous theoretical approaches proposed to explain glass formation and\njamming, one relates the observed slowing down of dynamics to the presence of \"geometric\nfrustration\" [37,30,46]. The latter describes a competition between global and local constraints whose manifestation is an impossibility to tile the whole space by extending the local structure characteristic of the liquid (or of any other glassforming system). Along these\nlines, a minimal model is provided by a two-dimensional atomic fluid of disks embedded in\nthe hyperbolic plane [36,39,29]. The negative curvature of space prevents the extension of\nthe local hexagonal order and generates frustration. It was found in a computer simulation\nstudy [39] that as the liquid is cooled, crystallization in hexagonal or related structures is\navoided whereas the relaxation time increases rapidly and leads at low temperature to glass\nformation when the system no longer equilibrates on simulation time scales. At low enough\ntemperature, it was observed that the dynamics is dominated by rare curvature-induced defect structures that are separated on average by a distance of the order of the \"radius of\ncurvature\" \u03ba \u22121 of the embedding space (the gaussian curvature of the hyperbolic plane is\nK = \u2212\u03ba 2 ).\nStudying the dynamics of the glassforming liquid on the hyperbolic plane at lower temperature and following the possibly collective kinetics of the defects is in practice out of\nreach for computer simulation. To get some insight, one possible strategy is to resort to\nan even cruder model description: this brings us to the so-called \"kinetically constrained\nmodels\". Such models form the core of another line of thought on glassy systems, one that\nenvisages glass formation as a purely kinetic phenomenon with little or no thermodynamic\nand structural input [18]. Slowing down of the relaxation to equilibrium as temperature is\ndecreased is attributed to the emergence of kinetic constraints that restrain the dynamics\nof the system. Those constraints are introduced in an explicit but ad hoc way in a series\nof lattice models. Before introducing the more specific model we have in mind, it is worth\nstressing that the collective nature of the dynamics captured in the above simulations and the\none which is describable by kinetically constrained models on the hyperbolic lattice involve\ndifferent scales: roughly below the radius of curvature \u03ba \u22121 for the former (due to limited\ncomputer resources) and above for the latter (as a consequence of the hyperbolic metric, the\nbasic step of the tiling is always at least of order \u03ba \u22121 , see Section 3).\n\n2.2 Kinetically constrained models and bootstrap percolation\nThe kinetically constrained model we focus on is the one introduced by Fredrickson and\nAndersen (FA) in [17]. Given a graph G with vertex set V and edge set E, one has on each\nvertex i \u2208 V an Ising spin variable, \u03c3i = \u00b11.\nThe Hamiltonian is trivial, H = \u2212 21 \u2211i \u03c3i , i.e. the spins do not interact and, hence, the\nequilibrium distribution is a product measure. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo spin\n\n\f4\n\ndynamics is subjected to a kinetic constraint: at each time step\n\b a randomly chosen spin,\nsay i, is flipped with the standard rate w(\u03c3i \u2192 \u2212\u03c3i ) = min 1, e\u2212\u03b2 \u03c3i , if and only if the\nnumber of nearest neighbors (i.e. vertices connected by an edge to i) which are in the state\n\u22121 is larger than or equal to a fixed value f , which is called the facilitation parameter\n(\u03b2 = 1/T is the inverse temperature, with the Boltzmann constant set to 1). Physically, plus\nand minus spins can be thought of as describing small regions of low and high mobility in a\nglassforming system.\nThe FA model is one of the most studied kinetically constrained models. On Cayley\ntrees and on Bethe lattices of constant connectivity q, the FA model displays a dynamical\ntransition for 1 < f < q \u2212 1 [43,34,31] which is very similar to the ideal discontinuous\ntransition described by the Mode Coupling Theory of glassforming liquids [19, 10] while\nfor f = q \u2212 1 a transition takes place with an ergodicity breaking parameter equal to zero.\nOn the other hand, on any finite-dimensional hypercubic (Euclidean) lattice, this dynamical transition is wiped out by the diffusion of very rare cooperative defects [33, 49, 50], thus\nsupporting the \"mean-field\" character of the transition. Despite the absence of a true dynamical transition, the FA model on Euclidean lattices displays an interesting glassy behavior\nincluding a faster than Arrhenius growth of the relaxation times as the temperature goes to\nzero when f > 1 [35]. The mechanism which is responsible for this strong slowing down\nis that, as the temperature is lowered, \u22121 spins become rarer while the typical size of the\nregions which should be cooperatively rearranged in order to satisfy the constraint at a given\nsite becomes larger. Here, we analyze the behavior of the FA model on hyperbolic lattices.\nRemarkably, the study of the dynamical glass transition of the FA model can be reduced\nto the analysis of a static phase transition called bootstrap percolation (BP) [12]. In BP\none starts from an initial configuration in which each vertex of the graph G is occupied\nby a particle with probability \u03c1 and empty with probability 1 \u2212 \u03c1. Then, one randomly\nremoves particles that have fewer than m neighboring occupied sites; thus m is called the\nblocking parameter. Iterating this procedure leads to two possible asymptotic results: either\nthe lattice is completely empty, or the remaining occupied sites are all mutually blocked. We\nlet \u03c1c (G, m) denote the critical threshold above which blocked clusters occur. We recall that\nwhen G is a Euclidean lattice, \u03c1c = 1 for d < m \u2264 2d, and \u03c1c = 0 otherwise [16, 40]. On\nthe other hand, on infinite Cayley trees, Bethe lattices and random graphs of connectivity q,\n\u03c1c = 1 if m = q, \u03c1c = 0 if m = 1, and 0 < \u03c1c < 1 if 1 < m < q [12].\nThe connection with the FA model emerges by noticing that if the graph has constant\nconnectivity q, as the lattices we focus on, the BP procedure can equivalently be formulated\nby saying that one removes a particle if it has at least f = q + 1 \u2212 m empty neighbours1 .\nIn addition, one has to identify plus (minus) spins with filled (empty) sites, \u03c1 with the\nprobability for a spin to be equal to +1, i.e. \u03c1 = 1/(1 + exp(\u2212\u03b2 )), and m with m( f ) =\nq \u2212 f + 1. Then, it is easy to verify that if for a given initial configuration, the BP procedure\nends up with the whole lattice emptied, there exists for the corresponding spin configuration\na sequence of spin flips, each satisfying the kinetic constraint, that brings the configuration\nto that with all spins in the \u22121 state. As a result, all spins can eventually flip if 1/(1 +\nexp(\u2212\u03b2 )) < \u03c1c . Although this is not a guarantee of ergodicity in general, it is so for KCM's,\nas proved in [11]. (The underlying reason is that because of their trivial thermodynamic\nmeasure, the only ergodicity breaking that can take place is a \"reducibility transition\" at\nwhich the configuration space becomes disconnected in several pieces, each piece containing\nroughly the same number of configurations: see [47, 48] for a more detailed discussion.)\n1 If the graph does not have constant connectivity and one fixes the facilitation parameter, the procedure\ndoes not correspond to one with fixed blocking parameter.\n\n\f5\n\nConversely, if the BP ends up with a nonempty cluster of blocked sites, the latter is by\nconstruction formed by all the plus spins that will never move under FA dynamics. Thus,\nthe occurrence of a BP transition is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence\nof an ergodicity breaking transition in the corresponding FA model. Furthermore, if the BP\ntransition is discontinuous, i.e. if the fraction of blocked sites is strictly positive at \u03c1c , the\ndynamical transition for FA is also discontinuous. One can indeed show [47, 48] that, due to\nthe occurrence of a finite fraction of blocked spins, the local time-dependent spin correlation\nfunction relaxes to a finite plateau at \u03c1c (while below \u03c1c it relaxes to zero).\nIn conclusion, the existence of a dynamical transition for the FA model and some properties of this transition can be studied by focusing on the much simpler static problem of\nthe BP. This is what we have done for hyperbolic lattices. We postpone a direct investigation of the detailed dynamic behavior of kinetically constrained models on such lattices\nfor future work, but it is worth pointing out that the nature of the transition (continuous or\nfirst-order) has strong implications for the dynamics in both the ergodic and the nonergodic\nphases. For instance, a first-order transition comes with a characteristic two-step relaxation\nto equilibrium which emerges as one approaches the transition from the ergodic phase.\n\n3 Hyperbolic lattices\n3.1 General description\nThe hyperbolic plane H 2 , also called pseudosphere or Bolyai-Lobatchevski plane, is a Riemannian surface of constant negative curvature [20, 13]. Contrary to a sphere, which is a\nsurface of constant positive curvature, H 2 is infinite and cannot be embedded as a whole in\nthe three-dimensional Euclidean space. \"Models\", i.e. projections, must thus be used for its\nvisualization. The hyperbolic metric in polar coordinates (r, \u03c6 ) is given by\nds2 = dr2 +\n\n\u0012\n\nsinh(\u03bar)\n\u03ba\n\n\u00132\n\nd\u03c6 2\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u2212\u03ba 2 < 0 the Gaussian curvature. In the following, to represent hyperbolic lattices, we\nuse the Poincar\u00e9 disk model that maps the whole infinite space H 2 onto the open disk of\nradius unity. This projection (r0 = tanh(\u03bar/2), \u03c6 0 = \u03c6 ) is conformal, i.e. it preserves the\nangles, but is not isometric: the Euclidean distance between two points of the disk separated\nby a given distance in H 2 shrinks to zero when the points approach the disk perimeter (see\nFigure 1).\nIn this work, we consider hyperbolic lattices resulting from regular tilings or \"tessellations\" of the hyperbolic plane. Such tilings are generated by elements of discrete subgroups\nof the isometry group of H 2 , also called Fuchsian groups [32]. Each regular tessellation is\ncharacterized by the number p of faces (i.e. edges in two dimensions) of the primitive cell\nand the number q of adjacent cells meeting at any vertex of the tiling; they will be denoted\nby the Schl\u00e4fli symbol {p, q}. In the hyperbolic plane, regular tessellations exist provided\n(p \u2212 2)(q \u2212 2) > 4,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich allows an infinite number of possibilities [13, 20, 14]. The integers p and q can thus\nvary between 3 and \u221e. Note that the cases in which either p or q is infinite (but not both) are\nwell defined: for instance, the lattice {\u221e, q} is a tree of connectivity q (see Figure 1).\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 1: {\u221e, 3} hyperbolic tiling in the Poincar\u00e9 disk representation of the hyperbolic plane.\nThe graph formed by the vertices and the edges of the tiling has a tree structure. Note the\npresence of infinite loops which are the discrete analogs of horocircles (see Appendix A). If\nperiodic boundary conditions are employed, this lattice can then be considered as a Bethe\nlattice.\n\nThe negative curvature of the space in which these lattices are embedded imposes strong\ngeometrical constraints that give rise to quite different properties than those encountered in\nthe more familiar Euclidean lattices. First, once {p, q} have been fixed, the length of the\npolygon sides is also fixed and it is at least of the order \u03ba \u22121 [8]: this is why kinetically constrained models on hyperbolic lattices can only explore length scales above \u03ba \u22121 . Furthermore, the metric of the hyperbolic plane given in Equation (1) induces that for a hyperbolic\n2\u03c0\u03ba \u22121 sinh(\u03bar)\ndisk of radius r in H 2 , the ratio of its perimeter to its area is given by 4\u03c0\u03ba\n\u22122 sinh2 ( \u03bar ) and\n2\ngoes to a nonzero value, \u03ba, when \u03bar \u2192 \u221e. Thus, surface (boundary) effects can never be\nneglected in the hyperbolic plane. The same reasoning carries over to hyperbolic lattices\nwhich therefore belong to the class of nonamenable graphs [25]: graphs with a nonzero\n\"edge-isoperimetric constant\", i.e. such that the number of edges between vertices of the\ngraph and the exterior scales like the number of interior edges. Cayley trees are examples of\nnonamenable graphs (but random graphs are amenable). Nonamenable graphs share common properties [25]: they are in some sense infinite-dimensional and lead in many cases to\nphase transitions having mean-field character [41].\n\n\f7\n\n3.2 Relation with trees\nIn this section we describe tree-like structures which can be embedded into hyperbolic lattices and will be useful in the analysis of the BP transition. For all hyperbolic lattices with\np > 4, by cutting appropriate links one can construct spanning trees with vertices of connectivity q and q \u2212 1. The general procedure to build such spanning trees will be detailed in\n[51]. It relies on a modification of the procedure devised in [26] to build trees that cover the\nhyperbolic lattices but contain additional edges which are not present in the original lattice2 .\nFinally, note that for p = 4 a similar procedure exists but the connectivity of vertices is q \u2212 1\nand q \u2212 2 [27].\nThe existence of these spanning trees with mixed connectivity also implies that a Cayley\ntree of constant connectivity q \u2212 1 (respectively, q \u2212 2) obtained by cutting some additional\nedges in the above spanning trees can be embedded in a hyperbolic lattice {p, q} for p > 4\n(respectively, p = 4). This regular tree is not spanning but one can easily build a collection\nof such regular trees which are overlapping and whose union covers the whole lattice. An\nexample of spanning tree for the {6, 5} lattice (which will be studied in detail in the following) is shown in Figure 2b. Note that vertices are not all equivalent: there are two types of\nvertices with connectivity 5 (depending on whether one or two of their direct descendants\nhave connectivity 4) and one type with connectivity 4, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n4 Existence of a bootstrap percolation transition on hyperbolic lattices\n4.1 Sketch of the proof\nCompared to standard bond and site percolation that has been quite thoroughly studied on\nhyperbolic lattices and nonamenable graphs [23,24, 9, 41, 3], BP has received less attention.\nIt has been solved on Bethe lattices and Cayley trees [12] and the result \u03c1c < 1 has also\nbeen proved on other nonamenable graphs under appropriate conditions on the graph topology [7]. Here, we adopt a strategy that is specifically devised for hyperbolic lattices and we\nconsider generic values of m and of the lattice parameters p and q. Let us start by stressing\nthat even if the hyperbolic lattices {p, q} are nonamenable, they have loops (cycles) on all\nlength scales for finite p and q. Thus they share at the same time properties of trees (nonamenability) and of Euclidean lattices (loops on all length scales). It is therefore a priori\nunclear if a BP transition at a nontrivial density should be expected as on trees or if the\npresence of finite loops wipes out the BP transition as in Euclidean lattices.\nFor some choices of the parameters m, p and q (m = 2 whatever p, q and m = 3, p = 3\nwhatever q, see Appendix A), there exist finite blocked clusters for any \u03c1 > 0. These cases\nare not very interesting from the physical point of view since the corresponding FA model\nis nonergodic at any nonzero density (i.e., trivially, \u03c1c = 0), whereas an ergodicity-breaking\ntransition only makes physical sense if it is due to an infinite cluster of jammed particles. We\ndisregard these cases and focus on lattices characterized by p > 3, m > 2 and p = 3, m > 3.\nAs explained in Appendix A, it is only in these cases that blocked clusters are necessarily\ninfinite. In addition, we do not consider the case m = q ( f = 1) which leads to an all empty\n2 Our modification guarantees that vertices which are neighbors on the tree are necessarily neighbors on\nthe lattice, unlike the tree resulting from the procedure in [26]. This is done as follows: whenever there are\nj links that connect a polygon of generation i to polygons of generation i + 1, . . . , i + j in the spanning trees\nof [26], we substitute the l-th link with a link between the polygon of generation i + (l \u2212 1) and the one of\ngeneration i + l.\n\n\f8\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2: Part of the {6, 5} hyperbolic tiling in the Poincar\u00e9 disk representation of the hyperbolic plane: 2a full lattice with loops; 2b spanning tree with discarded edges shown as red\ndotted lines. Note the small number of edges that one needs to cut to avoid loops.\n\nconfiguration as soon as there exists at least one empty site in the initial configuration (thus,\ntrivially, \u03c1c = 1).\nWe now state some basic results that will be useful for the analysis of BP with blocking\nparameter m on a graph G. Consider a subgraph G\u0303 \u2282 G, then the following inequality holds\nbetween the BP thresholds:\n\u03c1c (G, m) \u2264 \u03c1c (G\u0303, m).\n(3)\nThe reason is that a blocked configuration on G\u0303 is also blocked on G because adding links\ncannot help unblocking a structure: the number of blocked neighbors in G can only increase\nor remain equal to the value in G\u0303. The other important inequality that will be needed in\n\n\f9\n\nthe following concerns \u03c1 c (G, f ), the critical density on the graph G with the facilitation\nparameter f .\nIf instead G\u0303 contains all the vertices and a subset of the edges of G and we perform BP\nwith constant facilitation parameter f we obtain\n\u03c1 c (G, f ) \u2265 \u03c1 c (G\u0303, f ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe reason is that an unblocked configuration on G\u0303 is also unblocked on G because adding\nlinks can only increase or leave constant the number of empty neighbors of a given site. A\ndirect consequence of this result is that if we have a collection of (possibly overlapping)\ngraphs G\u0303i \u2282 G such that their union \u222ai G\u0303i covers G, then it analogously follows that\n\u03c1 c (G, f ) \u2265 inf \u03c1 c (G\u0303i , f ).\ni\n\n(5)\n\nFinally, we note that on lattices with a fixed connectivity q, as for the hyperbolic lattices,\n\u03c1 c (G, f ) = \u03c1c (G, m( f )) = \u03c1c (G, q + 1 \u2212 f ). As a consequence, the two inequalities (5) and\n(3) allow us to obtain lower and upper bounds on the critical BP density on hyperbolic\nlattices.\nAs explained in section 3.2, there exists for the hyperbolic lattice {p, q} with p > 4 a\nsequence of Cayley trees G\u0303 of constant connectivity q\u0303 = q \u2212 1 that covers the lattice. Thus,\nwe can apply (3) and (5) to BP with blocking parameter m on the lattice {p, q}, noticing\nthat \u03c1 c (G\u0303, f ) = \u03c1c (G\u0303, q\u0303 \u2212 f + 1) = \u03c1c (G\u0303, m \u2212 1) (recall that the facilitation parameter for a\nhyperbolic lattice {p, q} is q + 1 \u2212 m). Hence, we obtain:\n\u03c1c (T q\u22121 , m \u2212 1) \u2264 \u03c1c ({p, q}, m) \u2264 \u03c1c (T q\u22121 , m),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere we have used the notation T q to indicate an infinite tree of constant connectivity q.\nAs we have already recalled in Section 2.2, if 2 \u2264 m < q \u2212 1, then 0 < \u03c1c (T q\u22121 , m) < 1\n(see e.g. [12]). Therefore, we conclude that a BP transition also occurs on {p, q} hyperbolic lattices with p > 4, q > 4 for 3 \u2264 m < q \u2212 1 since we obtain 0 < \u03c1c (T q\u22121 , m \u2212 1) \u2264\n\u03c1c ({p, q}, m) \u2264 \u03c1c (T q\u22121 , m) < 1. The case m = q \u2212 1 requires special care in order to prove\nthat the critical density is bounded away from one. We will give a specific example (m=4,\nq=5, p=6) of how to prove this result in the next section. Analogously, by using the embedded trees of connectivity q \u2212 2 for the case p = 4 one immediately obtains that 0 < \u03c1c < 1\nwhen 4 \u2264 m \u2264 q \u2212 2. The other cases will be treated in a forthcoming publication [51].\nBy similar arguments and using the spanning trees with mixed connectivities q and\nq \u2212 1, one can establish tighter bounds on the critical density as will be illustrated in the\nnext section for the {6, 5} lattice.\n\n4.2 Illustration: the {6, 5} lattice with m = 3\nFor the {6, 5} lattice, a possible spanning tree with mixed connectivity 4 and 5, which will be\ndenoted by T 4,5 , is shown in Figures 2b and 3. The construction rules follow the procedure\nof [26] with the modification explained in section 3.2 (see caption of Fig. 3).\nWe now derive \u03c1c (T 4,5 , 3) and \u03c1 c (T 4,5 , 3) which, thanks to inequalities (3) and (4),\nrespectively provide an upper and a lower bound to the critical density \u03c1c ({6, 5}, 3) =\n\u03c1 c ({6, 5}, 3) of the hyperbolic lattice under consideration.\nAs explained in the caption of the Figure 3, the vertices of the tree are of three different\ntypes, corresponding to two different connectivities. Thanks to the tree structure and following the same method as in [43,50], one can write for each type of vertex a recurrence relation\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 3: Part of a tree with mixed connectivity (5, 4) that spans the {6, 5} hyperbolic lattice.\nEdges indicated by the dotted lines correspond to branches of the original lattice pruned\nto avoid loops. The blue edges correspond to an hexagon of the original {6, 5} lattice. In\nthis spanning tree, vertices are not equivalent and three different types are present, which\ndepend on their descendants: \u25e6 possesses three descendants (\u2217 \u2022, \u2022, \u2022), \u2022 has four descendants\n(\u2217 \u2022, \u2022, \u2022, \u25e6) and \u2217 \u2022 has four descendants (\u25e6, \u2217 \u2022, \u2022, \u25e6). Note that the top vertex has also one\nparent, not shown in the figure.\n\non the probability P that a site is blocked assuming that its \"parent\" vertex is itself blocked.\nFor instance, by considering a vertex of type \u25e6 (see Figure 3), one can derive its probability\nP\u25e6 as a function of the probabilities of its descendants which are of types \u2217 \u2022 and \u2022, i.e. P\u2217 \u2022\nand P\u2022 . The procedure can be repeated for vertices of the two other types and this provides\nequations relating the probabilities P\u25e6 , P\u2217 \u2022 and P\u2022 at two successive generations of the tree.\nThen, we perform the standard \"Bethe lattice\" trick which consists of considering only the\ndeep interior of the tree and assuming that all vertices of the same type are equivalent 3 . As\ncan be shown on the Cayley tree, this procedure that amounts to avoiding boundary effects\ndoes not affect the location of the threshold at \u03c1c (see below for a more detailed discussion).\nThis leads to the following set of coupled equations for BP with blocking parameter m = 3:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2P\u25e6 = \u03c1 P\u2022 (P\u2022 + 2P\u2217 \u2022 (1 \u2212 P\u2022 ))\n\u0001\nP\u2217 \u2022 = \u03c1 P\u25e62 + 2P\u25e6 (1 \u2212 P\u25e6 )(P\u2217 \u2022 + P\u2022 ) + P\u2217 \u2022 P\u2022 (1 \u2212 4P\u25e6 + 3P\u25e62 )\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\nP\u2022 = \u03c1 P\u20222 + 2P\u2022 (1 \u2212 P\u2022 )(P\u2217 \u2022 + P\u25e6 ) + P\u2217 \u2022 P\u25e6 (1 \u2212 4P\u2022 + 3P\u20222 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\n3 When we refer to the Bethe lattice, we think of an infinite tree-like structure as is the case for an infinite\nCayley tree. However, while the latter is constructed via the infinite volume limit of a finite tree and therefore\nhas a boundary at infinity (i.e. leaves), the Bethe lattice has no boundary.\n\n\f11\n\nand for BP with facilitation parameter f = 3:\n\uf8f1\n\u0001\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2P\u25e6 = \u03c1 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 P\u2217 \u2022 )(1 \u2212 P\u2022 )\n\u0001\nP\u2217 \u2022 = \u03c1 P\u25e62 + 2P\u25e6 (1 \u2212 P\u25e6 )(P\u2217 \u2022 + P\u2022 ) + P\u2217 \u2022 P\u2022 (1 \u2212 4P\u25e6 + 3P\u25e62 )\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\nP\u2022 = \u03c1 P\u20222 + 2P\u2022 (1 \u2212 P\u2022 )(P\u2217 \u2022 + P\u25e6 ) + P\u2217 \u2022 P\u25e6 (1 \u2212 4P\u2022 + 3P\u20222 ) .\n\n(8)\n\nA numerical solution of the above two systems of equations yields in both cases the coexistence of two solutions above a critical density smaller than one, thus for our hyperbolic\nlattice via inequalities (3) and (4) we get\n\u03c1c (T 4,5 , 3) ' 0.711 \u2264 \u03c1c ({6, 5}, 3) \u2264 \u03c1 c (T 4,5 , 3) ' 0.734,\n\n(9)\n\nwhich provides a rather good estimate of the critical density for the hyperbolic lattice under\nconsideration. (The simpler bounds of Equation (6) on the other hand provide \u03c1c (T 4 , 2) =\n1/3 \u2264 \u03c1c ({6, 5}, 3) \u2264 \u03c1 c (T 4 , 3) = 8/9.)\nFor m = 4, the same method can be applied and the numerical solution of the corresponding equations yields 0.940 \u2264 \u03c1c ({6, 5}, 4) \u2264 0.985. Thus, a transition also takes place\nfor m = 4 in the {6, 5} lattice. Note that this gives one specific example of how to deal with\nthe case m = q \u2212 1 for which the existence of a transition at a finite critical density cannot\nbe proved by simply using the spanning collection of regular trees of connectivity q \u2212 1.\n\n5 Order of the transition\nIn the previous section, we have established the existence of a BP transition on appropriate\nhyperbolic lattices at 0 < \u03c1c < 1. Here we provide evidence supporting that this transition\nhas a first-order (i.e. discontinuous) character: the order parameter which corresponds to\nthe probability that a given site is blocked is discontinuous at \u03c1c . We also obtain numerical\nindication of a diverging correlation length. Thus, the behavior resembles that of the BP\ntransition on tree-like structures such as Bethe lattices and random graphs.\nUnfortunately, the analysis of the first-order character of the BP transition is much more\ninvolved for hyperbolic lattices than for either Bethe or Euclidean lattices. In the latter cases,\none can simply measure the distribution of blocked sites. For a discontinuous transition,\nthis would show a characteristic double-peaked structure, with the peak centered on zero\ncorresponding to the absence of any blocked cluster and the other peak centered at a finite\ndistance from zero corresponding to the appearance of a finite fraction of blocked sites at\nthe transition. This strategy does not work for hyperbolic lattices because of the effect of\nboundary sites. Due to the nonamenability of the lattices, one has to be very careful with\nboundary effects, as we explain in the following.\n\n5.1 Taking into account boundary condition effects: discussion and some conjectures\nWe consider a hyperbolic lattice and a disk of large radius R centered on a given vertex of\nthe lattice which we refer to as the origin. We call boundary sites those that are outside the\ndisk but are connected to at least one vertex inside the disk. The vertices inside the disk\nevolve according to the BP dynamics, starting from an initial configuration with a density\n\u03c1 and with the boundary vertices frozen to a configuration in which sites are independently\noccupied with probability \u03c1b . The influence of \u03c1b on the final state inside the disk after the\nbootstrap dynamics is a question that has not yet been addressed, even on trees. We make\n\n\f12\n\ntwo conjectures on this influence for nonamenable systems which display in infinite volume\na BP transition at 0 < \u03c1c < 1. As will be shown in the following section, the validity of\nthese conjectures can be checked on the exactly solvable case of the Cayley tree (which is\na nonamenable graph and a special case of a hyperbolic lattice). Call P0 (\u03c1, \u03c1b ) the limit as\nR \u2192 \u221e of the probability that the vertex at the origin is blocked and \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1) the minimal\nboundary density which gives a non zero P0 (i.e. P0 (\u03c1, \u03c1b ) = 0 only if \u03c1b < \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1)). We\nconjecture that\n\u2013 if the BP transition is discontinuous and \u03c1 is infinitesimally above \u03c1c then \u03c1b\u2217 > 0 (i.e.\nlim\u03b5\u21920+ \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1c + \u03b5) > 0).\n\u2013 if the BP transition is continuous and \u03c1 is infinitesimally above \u03c1c , then \u03c1b\u2217 = 0 (i.e.\nlim\u03b5\u21920+ \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1c + \u03b5) = 0).\nFigure 4 summarizes how to distinguish between continuous and discontinuous BP transitions by using the above conjectures. Note that \u03c1b\u2217 is a monotonously decreasing function of\n\u03c1 since a larger initial bulk density requires the same or a lower boundary density to support\nthe bulk blocked particles. (In Figure 4 we show a discontinuous case with lim\u03c1\u21921 \u03c1b\u2217 > 0,\nas it happens on Cayley trees, see below. However in other cases this limit might be zero.)\nAnother important remark is that for BP with periodic boundary conditions one can take\nas an order parameter either the fraction of blocked sites or the probability that the origin\nis blocked. Here, by contrast, boundary conditions are fixed and the former definition is\nnot meaningful since the boundary may support a very large number of blocked particles\nin its vicinity even though the clusters of blocked particles do not percolate. In general,\nwhen dealing with nonamenable systems one should be careful because boundary effects\ncan propagate into the entire system. Several recent studies seem to overlook this point [44,\n45,2,5,3]. To properly control these effects, one should either study them explicitly as we\ndo here (see also [52,1,15,4]) or use periodic boundary conditions [6, 38, 29, 39].\n\n5.2 Cayley tree\nWe now verify the conjectures of the previous section for a specific nonamenable graph,\nthe Cayley tree of connectivity q when 0 < \u03c1c < 1, i.e. for 2 \u2264 m \u2264 q \u2212 1. Thanks to the\ntree structure, the following recurrence relation holds for the probability Pi that a vertex of\ngeneration i is blocked assuming that its parent vertex of generation i \u2212 1 is blocked:\nq+1\u2212m \u0012\n\nPi = \u03c1\n\n\u2211\nk=1\n\n\u0013\nq \u2212 1 q\u2212k\nP (1 \u2212 Pi+1 )k\u22121 .\nk \u2212 1 i+1\n\n(10)\n\nIf the Cayley tree is infinite, translation invariance guarantees that Pi+1 = Pi = P and we\nobtain from Equation (10) a fixed point equation for P (the same property applies in the\nBethe lattice procedure). Furthermore, the probability P for a vertex to be blocked (without\nassuming its parent to be blocked) satisfies\nq\u2212m \u0012\n\nP=\u03c1\n\n\u2211\nk=0\n\n\u0013\nq q\u2212k\nP (1 \u2212 P)k .\nk\n\n(11)\n\nIf P is nonzero, then P is nonzero too and from Equation (10) one can compute the critical\ndensity \u03c1c at which the BP transition takes place [7]. The transition is continuous (P(\u03c1c ) =\nP(\u03c1c ) = 0) for m = 2 and discontinuous for 3 < m < q \u2212 1.\n\n\f13\n\n \u0304\n\nP\n\n\u03c1b\n1\n\n \u0304\n\nPc\n1\n\n\u03c1*(1)\n\n0\n\nb\n\n1\n\n\u03c1c\n\n0\n\n\u03c1\n\nFig. 4: Probability P for a vertex to be blocked depending on the initial density \u03c1 and the\ndensity at the boundary \u03c1b for a continuous (in red) and a discontinuous (in blue) BP transition. \u03c1c is the density at the transition, Pc the nonzero probability for a vertex to be blocked\nat the transition when the latter is discontinuous, \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1) (the blue line in the P = 0 plane)\nthe boundary density below which the system is completely emptied for all values of the\ninitial bulk density \u03c1, and \u03c1b\u2217 (1) = \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1 = 1). The\u221adiscontinuous data are for a Cayley tree\n10\nof connectivity q = 5 with m = 3: then, \u03c1c = 68\u22125\n' 0.7248 and Pc ' 0.4132. Note that\n72\nthe direction of the \u03c1 axis is reversed to improve the readability of the figure.\n\nIf instead we perform the finite volume procedure with frozen boundary conditions of\ndensity \u03c1b (say on generation n) detailed above, vertices are no longer equivalent and Equation (10) can be directly used to compute how Pi evolves when starting from the n-th frozen\ngeneration. The probability P0 can be explicitly computed for any couple of values of \u03c1 and\n\u03c1b . The outcome is plotted in Figure 6. We can now check that the conjectures of section 5.1\nare verified.\nCall f (P) the function such that the right-hand side of Equation (10) corresponds to\nf (Pi ). If 3 \u2264 m < q \u2212 1, f (P) has only one stable fixed point at P = 0 for \u03c1 < \u03c1c , two fixed\npoints at \u03c1 = \u03c1c , P = 0 which is stable and P = Pc which is unstable, and three fixed points\nfor \u03c1 > \u03c1c , two stable ones and an unstable one, Pu (\u03c1). In Figure 5a, the evolution of Pi\nis represented as a function of the initial condition Pn = \u03c1b for a tree with n generations. If\n\u03c1 > \u03c1c and \u03c1b < Pu then P0 goes to zero, whereas if \u03c1b > Pu then P0 goes to the second\nattractive fixed point which has a nonzero value. Thus, by using the notation of previous\nsection, we obtain \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1) = Pu (\u03c1) > 0 when \u03c1 > \u03c1c and our conjecture on discontinuous\nBP transitions is verified for the Cayley tree. Note that since Pu < Pc the bulk behavior on\nthe tree is identical to the behavior in the Bethe lattice procedure considered above when\n\u03c1b \u2265 Pc , while for \u03c1b < Pc , boundary effects have to be taken into account (see Figure 6).\nFor the opposite case m = 2, the function f (P) (see Figure 5b) has always a fixed point at\nP = 0, stable when \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1c and unstable otherwise, and a second stable fixed point appears\nfor \u03c1 > \u03c1c . Since the stable fixed point is always unique, the bulk behavior is not affected\n\n\f14\n\nf(P)\n\n\u03c1*(1)\nb\n\n(a) Discontinuous transition (m > 2): \u03c1b\u2217 (1) represents the threshold of\n\u03c1b below which the system is totally emptied when the density \u03c1 = 1; it\ncorresponds to an unstable fixed point.

This result for the continuous transition\non the Cayley tree with m = 2 is compatible with our conjecture in section 5.1.\n\n5.3 Generic hyperbolic lattices\nDue to the presence of loops in generic hyperbolic lattices, the iterative method used for the\nCayley tree cannot be applied and we are not able to prove the conjectures of section 5.1.\nHowever, accepting the validity of the conjectures, we obtain evidence that the transition\n(when it exists) is discontinuous. Indeed, we can show that there is a nonzero boundary\ndensity \u03c1b\u2217 below which the system is totally emptied at the end of the BP process.\nConsider the hyperbolic lattice {p, q} with p > 4 and call T q,q\u22121 its spanning trees of\nmixed connectivity q, q \u2212 1 (see Section 3.2). As we did for Cayley trees in the previous\nsection, one can verify that the BP transition on T q,q\u22121 with facilitation parameter m + q \u2212 1\nis discontinuous for m > 3 and that \u03c1b\u2217 (T q,q\u22121 , \u03c1) > 0 for \u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1 c (T q,q\u22121 , q \u2212 m + 1). As\nstressed in section 4.1, if one performs BP with facilitation parameter q \u2212 m + 1, each\nunblocked site on the spanning tree is also unblocked for BP on the {p, q} lattice with\nthe same facilitation parameter, i.e. with a blocking parameter m. Thus, \u03c1c ({p, q}, m) \u2265\n\u03c1 c (T q,q\u22121 , q\u2212m+1) and \u03c1b\u2217 ({p, q}, \u03c1) \u2265 \u03c1b\u2217 (T q,q\u22121 , \u03c1). As a consequence, we get \u03c1b\u2217 ({p, q}, \u03c1) \u2265\n\u03c1b\u2217 (T q,q\u22121 , \u03c1) > 0 for \u03c1 > \u03c1c ({p, q}, m): the transition on the hyperbolic lattice {p, q} with\np > 4 and blocking parameter m > 3 is discontinuous provided one assumes the validity of\nour first conjecture in section 5.1. In the next section we numerically analyze a case with\nm = 3 which is not covered by the above argument.\n\n5.4 Simulation on the {6, 5} lattice: role of boundary conditions and diverging lengthscale\nWe have carried out a numerical simulation on the {6, 5} hyperbolic lattice with blocking\nparameter m = 3. The objective of this study is, on the one hand, to provide additional\nevidence that the BP transition in hyperbolic lattices is discontinuous and, on the other hand,\nto unveil the existence of a diverging lengthscale when approaching the BP transition from\nlow density.\nFollowing the procedure of section 5.1, we consider only the region inside a finite circle of given radius R and the boundary sites are frozen with a density \u03c1b . The system is\ninitialized by filling vertices inside the circle with a density \u03c1 and the BP dynamics with\nm = 3 is recursively applied until no more vertices can be emptied. Our numerical results\nare obtained with lattices of 27 to 3227991 sites, which corresponds to values of R from 2 to\n14, and are averaged over 103 realizations with identical conditions {\u03c1, \u03c1b }. Figure 6 shows\na three-dimensional plot of the computed probability P0 that the central site is occupied and\nblocked, when \u03c1 and \u03c1b vary between 0 and 1.\nBy looking at the case \u03c1 = 1, one can see that the system is completely emptied for\nboundary densities smaller than \u03c1b (1) ' 0.24: thus, lim\u03b5\u21920 \u03c1b\u2217 (\u03c1c + \u03b5) > 0 and, through the\nfirst conjecture of section 5.1, we conclude that the transition is discontinuous.\nIn order to support the above conclusion one should proceed to a finite-size study of the\ncase \u03c1b = 1. The \u03c1-dependence of the probability P0 for the central site to be blocked is\ndisplayed in Figure 7 for sizes ranging from R = 2 to R = 14. The data clearly point toward\nthe existence of a transition at nontrivial \u03c1c \u223c 0.7, but they display strong finite-size effects\nwhich of course always make P0 a continuous function of \u03c1. A better description would\nrequire a finite-size scaling analysis. However the sizes we can numerically investigate are\n\n\f16\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\nFig. 6: Probability P0 that the central vertex is occupied and blocked plotted as a function of\nthe initial bulk and densities, \u03c1 and \u03c1b . Comparison of the numerical results for the {6, 5}\nhyperbolic tiling (in blue) and the analytical results for the Cayley tree of connectivity 5 (in\nred). The results are for a lattice of 59561 vertices and are averaged over 103 different initial\nconditions for each value of {\u03c1, \u03c1b }.\n\nnot large enough to allow a proper analysis (which is rather delicate as one knows from the\ncorresponding study in the Cayley tree). By analogy with the behavior on the latter graph we\nexpect that P0 (\u03c1) converges at large sizes to a function of the scaling variable R(\u03c1c \u2212 \u03c1)0.5 .\nWe stress that the finite-size effects also reveal the existence of a growing (and expectedly diverging) lengthscale when approaching the BP transition from low density, which is\nquite distinct from what is encountered in usual first order phase transitions. Actually, the\nfinite-size effects indicate that for densities lower than some critical value \u03c1c typical initial\nconfigurations contain a finite fraction of blocked sites. It is only for system of large enough\nsize that the boundary does not support blocked structures any more. This means that approaching the BP transition from low density in an infinite system, sub-regions of radius\nless than a characteristic size are typically blocked and can be unblocked only by starting\nfrom the boundary. Therefore, one expects that the dynamics of the corresponding FA model\nwill show diverging dynamical correlations at the ergodicity breaking transition. In order to\nobtain the precise scaling of the dynamical correlations, additional work is however needed.\nFinally, we note that, quite strikingly, the numerical results obtained for the {6, 5} hyperbolic lattice are very similar (up to our numerical precision and to finite size effects) to the\nexact ones for the Cayley tree of the same connectivity q = 5 (such a tree is not a subgraph\nof the lattice). This is illustrated in Figure 6. Qualitatively, the two systems appear to share\nthe same behavior: existence of a discontinuous transition with same critical density within\nnumerical uncertainty, same dependence with the boundary density, and same variation of\n\n\f17\n\n \u0304\n\n0\n\nP0 when \u03c1 > \u03c1c . The loops present (on all length scales) in the hyperbolic lattice do not\nseem to affect much the phenomenology of BP on hyperbolic lattices 4 .\n\nFig. 7: Evolution of the probability P0 (\u03c1) for the central site to be blocked for \u03c1b = 1 when\nvarying the system size R between 2 and 14. The corresponding number of vertices goes\nfrom 27 to 3227991. One can note that for \u03c1 & 0.75, P is independent of R.\n\n6 Conclusion\nIn this article, we have proved that BP displays a transition at a nontrivial threshold for appropriate choices of the blocking parameter on hyperbolic lattices formed by regular tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. This in turn implies that the kinetically constrained models\nof the FA type have a dynamical transition at the same nontrivial threshold 5 . Remarkably,\nthis transition occurs despite the presence of loops on all length scales in hyperbolic lattices.\nWe have moreover provided theoretical and numerical evidence (but admittedly, not a\nrigorous proof) that the transition is first-order with a discontinuous jump of the order parameter. The characteristics of the transition are very similar to those on related tree structures.\n4 This conclusion certainly does not apply to the case m = 2, for which \u03c1 = 0 on the hyperbolic lattice\nc\ndue to the presence of blocked structures, whereas a continuous transition takes place on Cayley trees. (To\ncorroborate the validity of our simulations we have also verified that indeed \u03c1c ' 0 for m = 2 on the {6, 5}\nlattice and that in this case the bulk behavior is not influenced by the boundary density.)\n5 By similar arguments one can also prove that a transition at a nontrivial threshold occurs on hyperbolic\nlattices for Kob Andersen models [22], the conservative dynamics counterpart of FA models. We defer to\nfuture work a detailed analysis of these conservative dynamics\n\n\f18\n\nIn particular, we have numerically shown the existence of a diverging lengthscale when\napproaching the BP transition from low density. This phenomenon is expected to induce\ndiverging dynamical correlations in the dynamics of the FA model close to the ergodicto-nonergodic transition. In fact, the dynamics of the associated FA kinetically constrained\nmodels should also bear a strong resemblance with their counterparts on Bethe lattices and\nrandom graphs, with a two-step relaxation in the ergodic phase and a jump of the nonergodicity parameter at the transition. In relation to glassforming liquids, this raises the intriguing\npossibility that an ideal ergodicity-breaking transition as predicted by the Mode Coupling\nTheory of glasses could exist for atomic liquids on the hyperbolic plane at low temperature,\nin a regime which is dominated by scarce topological defects.\nA question that remains open for BP on hyperbolic lattices, certainly deserving further\nstudies, is whether there exists a diverging correlation length when approaching the transition from the high-density phase. Such a correlation length has been shown [21, 42] to exist\nfor random graphs (or Bethe lattices) and, in this context, it is related to a square root singularity of the fraction of blocked sites. Are these two phenomena also present for hyperbolic\nlattices?\nFinally, we conclude this work by stressing that hyperbolic lattices appear to be intermediate between random graphs and Euclidean lattices since they contain loops on all\nlengthscales and at the same time, because of the hyperbolic metric, are characterized by an\nexponential increase with the distance of the number of neighbors of a given site. It would\ntherefore be interesting to study glassy systems and optimization problems, which have recently received much attention on random graphs [28], on hyperbolic lattices. Would new\nphenomena take place or would the physical behavior remain the same despite the presence\nof loops on all lengthscales? Would the cavity techniques [28] developed for random graphs\nbe useful to study glassy systems on hyperbolic lattices? We leave these questions for further\ninvestigations.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge partial support from the ANR Dynhet and ANRBLAN07-2184264.\n\nA Existence of finite blocked clusters\nFirst of all, it is easily realized that, whatever the values of p and q, finite blocked clusters exist when m = 2.\nIndeed, the vertices of each elementary polygon of the lattice with p edges can all be blocked irrespective of\nthe state of the vertices not belonging to this polygon. This occurs with a nonzero probability. When p = 3,\nanother simple case arises: for m = 3, clusters made of q + 1 vertices (1 at the center and q around) are also\nblocked with a nonzero probability.\nA simple way to find values of m for which finite blocked clusters can never exist is to use a kind of\n\"convexity\" argument. Assume that there exists a finite blocked cluster for BP with blocking parameter m\non a {p, q} lattice and consider its boundary, i.e. vertices that are part of the cluster but connected to at least\none unblocked vertex (this definition differs from that used in section 5.1). Each boundary vertex must have\nat least m neighbors in the cluster. The tiling being regular, the angle between two edges joining a boundary\nvertex to its nearest neighbors on the boundary is larger than 2\u03c0(m \u2212 1)/q. If 2\u03c0(m \u2212 1)/q > \u03c0, then the angle\nat each boundary vertex is strictly larger than \u03c0 and by convexity argument, the cluster must be infinite. Thus,\nfor m > q/2 + 1, no finite blocked cluster can exist. One can easily check that the above arguments also hold\nin the case of Euclidean lattices.\nWe now show that the hyperbolic metric is such that finite blocked clusters exist only for m = 2 for\ngeneral p and m = 3 for p = 3. Indeed, the bounds on m can be refined. A property of the hyperbolic metric is\nthat there exist disks of infinite radius and area, but with a boundary that does not follow a geodesic 6 . Such\ndisks are called \"horodisks\" and their boundary a \"horocircle\". One of the specificities of a horodisk is that\n6 In the case of Euclidean geometry, a disk of infinite radius corresponds to a half space with a boundary\ncontaining geodesics. In two dimensions, the disk boundary is a line.\n\n\f19\nits area is smaller than that of the half-plane whose boundary is a geodesic, contrary to the Euclidean case in\nwhich an infinite disk is equivalent to the half-plane. Obviously, clusters not contained in any horodisk are\ninfinite.\nA geometric criterion sketched in Figure 8 gives a condition on m for minimal clusters to be infinite, i.e.\nnot contained in any horodisk. For a given m, the smallest possible blocked cluster has a regular boundary\nmade of blocked vertices connected to 2 blocked neighbors on the boundary, m \u2212 2 blocked vertices inside\nthe cluster and q \u2212 m vertices outside the cluster. We do not consider the feasibility of such a cluster, but only\nwhether it could be finite or not. Take any boundary vertex of the cluster. For the cluster to be finite, it must at\nleast be contained in one horocircle passing through this boundary vertex. However, this is only possible if the\nchord length `\u2217 along the geodesic joining the chosen vertex to one of its neighbors on the cluster boundary\nis larger than the edge length ` in the {p, q} lattice (see Figure 8). By using the fact that the cluster boundary\nis regular and by means of elementary hyperbolic trigonometry (setting the curvature to \u22121), one finds\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+1\ncos2 (m\u22121)\u03c0\nq\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(12)\ncosh(`\u2217 ) =\nsin2 (m\u22121)\u03c0\nq\nand\ncos2\ncosh(`) =\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03c0\nq\n\n+ cos\n\u0010 \u0011\n\nsin2\n\n\u0010\n\n2\u03c0\np\n\n\u0011\n.\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c0\nq\n\nSummarizing the above discussion, we conclude that if `\u2217 < `, or equivalently cosh(`\u2217 ) < cosh(`), no finite\nblocked clusters can exist. Through Equations (12) and (13), one obtains that for p > 3, this inequality is\nverified for all values of m such that 2 < m \u2264 (q \u2212 1)/2 + 1 and for p = 3 it is verified as soon as 3 < m \u2264\n(q \u2212 1)/2 + 1. No finite blocked clusters can therefore exist for these values of m. One can note that values of\nm for which this inequality does not hold correspond to those for which finite blocked clusters (with nonzero\nprobability) can easily be found (see above).\nTo sum up: on a {p, q} hyperbolic lattice, finite blocked clusters exist only when m = 2, for all values of\n(p, q), and when m = 3, for p = 3 irrespective of the value of q.\n\nReferences\n1.
