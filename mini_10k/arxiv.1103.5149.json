Introduction\nHistorically, there have been several papers from the beginning of the\ntwentieth century trying to find some structures for the well-known notion\nthe covering group and its varietal generalization, the V-covering group of\nsome famous groups and products of groups, such as the direct product, the\nnilpotent and the regular product [4, 5, 8, 11, 15, 21, 24].\nIt is known that any group has at least a covering group [21, 25]. Also\nthe number of covering groups for an arbitrary group has been studied by I.\nSchur [22]. Moreover, it is proved that any group has a V-covering group,\nwhere V is a Schreier variety [8, 10, 15].\nIn 1971, J. Wiegold [24] found a structure of a covering group for the\ndirect product G = A \u00d7 B so that the second nilpotent product of the\ncovering groups A\u2217 and B \u2217 is a covering group for G. In 1972, W. Haebich\n[4] constructed a covering group for a finite regular product. Moreover the\nstructure of a covering group for the verbal wreath product of two groups\nhas been studied by W. Haebich [5], in 1977.\nNaturally, it is of interest to know which class of groups does not have\na V-covering group. The first author [9, 10] gave some examples of groups\nwhich do not have any generalized covering group with respect to the variety\nof nilpotent groups of class at most c \u2265 2, Nc . More precisely, he [10]\nproved that every nilpotent group of class n with nontrivial c-nilpotent Schur\nmultiplier does not have any Nc -covering group for c > n. Thus the results of\nWiegold and Haebich mentioned above cannot be generalized to an arbitrary\nvariety. Moreover the first author [10] has given a complete answer to the\nexistence of Nc -covering group for finite abelian groups. Also in 2003, he in\na joint paper [11] found a structure for the Nc -covering group of a nilpotent\nproduct of a family of cyclic groups.\nNow in this paper, we intend to prove that the structure of V-covering\n2\n\n\fgroup, commutes with the direct limit of a directed system of groups in some\nsenses (see Theorem 3.5). Furthermore, we give an example showing that\nthe hypothesis of being directed for the system of groups, is an essential\ncondition (see Example 3.6). Finally, as an application, we extend some of\nthe previous formulas for the structure of V-covering groups for finite direct\nand regular products of groups to infinite ones.\n2. Notation and Preliminaries\nWe shall assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of the verbal\nsubgroup V (G), and the marginal subgroup V \u2217 (G) of a group G, associated\nwith a variety V. Whenever varieties of groups are discussed, we refer to H.\nNeumann [17] for notation and basic results.\nDefinition 2.1. Let V be a variety of groups defined by the set of laws V ,\nand let G be a group with a free presentation\n1 \u2192 R \u2192 F \u2192 G \u2192 1,\nwhere F is a free group. Then the Baer invariant of G, denoted by VM(G),\nis defined to be\nR \u2229 V (F )/[RV \u2217 F ],\nwhere V (F ) is the verbal subgroup of F and [RV \u2217 F ] is the least normal\nsubgroup N of F contained in R such that R/N \u2286 V \u2217 (F/N). Thus it is the\nsubgroup generated by the following set:\n[RV \u2217 F ] =< v(f1 , . . . , fi\u22121 , fi r, fi+1 , . . . , fn )v(f1 , . . . , fi , . . . , fn )\u22121 |\nr \u2208 R , fi \u2208 F, v \u2208 V , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n , n \u2208 N > .\nNote that the Baer invariant of a group G is always abelian and independent of the choice of the presentation of G and it might be possible to regard\nVM(\u2212) as the first left derived functor of the functor from all groups to V\n3\n\n\ftaking G to G/V (G) [8]. In particular, if V is the variety of abelian groups,\nthen the Baer invariant of the group G will be R \u2229 F \u2032 /[R, F ], which is the\nwell-known notion, the Schur multiplier of G, M(G). Also, if V = N c is the\nvariety of nilpotent groups of class at most c, then the Baer invariant of the\ngroup G will be R \u2229 \u03b3c+1 (F )/[R, c F ], where \u03b3c+1 (F ) is the (c + 1)-st term of\nthe lower central series of F and [R, 1 F ] = [R, F ], [R, c F ] = [[R,\n\nc\u22121 F ], F ]\n\ninductively. It is also called the c-nilpotent multiplier of G.\nDefinition 2.2. A variety V is called a Schur-Baer variety if for any group\nG for which the marginal factor group G/V \u2217 (G) is finite, then the verbal\nsubgroup V (G) is also finite and |V (G)| divides a power of |G/V \u2217 (G)|.\nI. Schur [21] proved that the variety of abelian group is a Schur-Baer variety and R. Baer [2] proved that a variety defined by some outer commutator\nwords, for instance the variety Nc , has the above property. The following\ntheorem gives a useful property of Schur-Baer varieties.\nTheorem 2.3 ([8]). A variety V is a Schur-Baer variety if and only if for\nevery finite group G, its Baer invariant VM(G) is of order dividing a power\nof |G|.\nDefinition 2.4. Let V be a variety of groups and let G be a group. Then, by\ndefinition, a V-covering group of G (a generalized covering group of G with\nrespect to V) is a group G\u2217 with a normal subgroup A such that G\u2217 /A \u223c\n= G,\nA \u2286 V (G\u2217 ) \u2229 V \u2217 (G\u2217 ), and A \u223c\n= VM(G) (see [8]).\nNote that if V is the variety of abelian groups, then a V-covering group of\nG will be an ordinary covering group (sometimes it is called a representing\ngroup) of G. Also if V = Nc , then an Nc -covering group of G is a group G\u2217\nwith a normal subgroup A such that\nG\u2217 \u223c\n= Nc M(G) .\n= G, A \u2286 Zc (G) \u2229 \u03b3c+1(G), and A \u223c\nA\nIt is well-known that every group G has a covering group (see [7, 21, 25]).\nIn general, for the existence of V-covering groups, we have the following\n4\n\n\fconcepts and results. Let V be a variety of groups, then a group G is called\nV-free if it is a free object in the category of all groups in the variety V. It\nis known that if F is a free group, then F/V (F ) is a V-free group. By a\nwell-known theorem of Schreier, every subgroup of a free group is also free.\nThus it is natural to define the following notion.\nDefinition 2.5. Let V be a variety of groups. Then V is called a Schreier\nvariety if and only if every subgroup of a V-free group is also V-free. It has\nbeen proved by P. M. Neumann and J. Wiegold [8, 18] that the only Schreier\nvarieties are the variety of all groups G, the variety of abelian groups, A, and\nthe variety of all abelian group of exponent p, Ap , where p is a prime.\nNote that the notion of Schreier varieties can be generalized to varieties in\nwhich every subgroup of a V-free group is a V-splitting group i.e. a group G\nin the variety V which splits every short exact sequence in V of the following\nform\n1\u2192A\u2192B\u2192G\u21921.\nClearly every Schreier variety has the above property. In fact the only varieties with the above property are G, A, Am where m is square free (see [8,\n18]).\nC. R. Leedham-Green and S. McKay [8], by a homological method, proved\nthat a sufficient condition for the existence of a V-covering group of G is that\nG/V (G) should be a V-splitting group. Also in the following theorem we\ngive a similar sufficient condition for the existence of a V-covering group of\na group.\nTheorem 2.6 ([8, 10, 15]). Let V be a variety in which every subgroup of\na V-free group is V-splitting. Then every group has a V-covering group. In\nparticular, if V is a Schreier variety, then every group has a V-covering group.\nAlso the first author [10] showed that if G is a nilpotent group of class\nn such that Nc M(G) 6= 1, and c > n, then G has no Nc -covering group.\n5\n\n\fMoreover, this fact has been extended to the variety of polynilpotent groups\nin some senses [12].\nWe next attend to some concepts as well-known categorical objects, the\ndirect system and the direct limit which are defined [19,20] for any arbitrary\ncategory, if any. Note that in some famous categories, specially the category\nof all groups, every direct system has a direct limit (see [19,20]). In particular,\nin the category of all groups, the free product\n\nQ\u2217\n\ni\u2208I\n\nGi as a coproduct of\n\n{Gi }i\u2208I is a direct limit of this family which is the trivial direct system and\nso is not directed (see [20]).\nIn our main results we deal with the particular case of direct systems\nwhich are indexed with a directed set, called directed system. In fact, we\nuse one of the equivalent form of the definition of direct limit of a directed\nsystem in the category of all groups, which is more simple and useful for\nour goal, as we mention in following preliminaries. Note that in all following\npoints, we refer the reader to [14, 19, 20] for further details.\nDefinition 2.7. Let {Gi } be a direct system of groups indexed by a partially\nordered set I, which is also directed, that is, for every i, j \u2208 I there exists\nk \u2208 I such that i, j \u2264 k. For i \u2264 j, let there exists a homomorphism\n\u03bbji : Gi \u2192 Gj such that:\n(i) \u03bbii : Gi \u2192 Gi is the identity map of Gi , for all i \u2208 I;\n(ii) If i \u2264 j \u2264 k, then \u03bbji \u03bbkj = \u03bbki , as the following commutative diagram:\n\u03bbj\n\ni\nGj\nGi \u2212\u2192\nk\n\n\u03bbki \u0581\n\n\u2193\u03bbj\nGk .\n\nIn this case, we call the system {Gi ; \u03bbji , I} a directed system. Now we define\nan equivalence relation on the disjoint union\ny \u2208 Gj , then\n6\n\nS\n\ni\u2208I\n\nGi , by: if x \u2208 Gi and\n\n\fx \u223c y if and only if x\u03bbki = y\u03bbkj for k \u2265 i, j.\nLet G denote the quotient set\n\nS\n\ni\u2208I\n\nGi / \u223c and use {x} for the equivalence\n\nclass of x. Also we define a multiplication on G as follows: if {x}, {y} are\nelements of G, we choose i, j \u2208 I such that x \u2208 Gi and y \u2208 Gj then\n{x}{y} = {(x\u03bbki )(y\u03bbkj )}, f or k \u2265 i, j.\nClearly this is a well-defined multiplication, which makes G into a group\nand it is called the direct limit of the directed system {Gi ; \u03bbji , I}. It will be\ndenoted by\nlim Gi =\n\u2212\u2192\n\n[\n\nGi / \u223c= G.\n\ni\u2208I\n\nWe need only the following well-known results of direct limits.\nLemma 2.8. Suppose that {Gi ; \u03bbji , I} is a directed system of groups and\nG = lim Gi . Then we have the following statements:\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(i) The group G has the universal property so that for a given group H and\nhomomorphisms \u03c4i : Gi \u2192 H, such that \u03bbji \u03c4j = \u03c4i for all i \u2264 j, there exists a\nunique homomorphism \u03c4 : G \u2192 H such that all the diagrams\nGi\n\u03bbi \u2193\n\n\u0581\u03c4i\n\u03c4\n\nG \u2212\u2192 H\ncommute, that is \u03bbi \u03c4 = \u03c4i , for all i \u2208 I.\n(ii) Direct limit of exact sequences, indexed by a directed set, is exact, and\nso in this case, the direct limit preserves injections.\n(iii) Let G be an arbitrary group, then G is the direct limit of its finitely\ngenerated subgroups, under the obvious directed system arising from the\ninclusion maps.\nDefinition 2.9. Let C and D be two categories and let T1 : C \u2192 D, T2 :\n7\n\n\fD \u2192 C be two functors such that for any X \u2208 C, Y \u2208 D there is a natural\nequivalence\nHomD (T1 X, Y ) \u2243 HomC (X, T2 Y ).\nIn this case, T2 is called a right adjoint functor to T1 and the pair (T1 , T2 ) is\ncalled an adjoint pair. It is well-known fact that every functor which has a\nright-adjoint, commutes with direct limits. So we have the following lemma\n(see [20]).\nLemma 2.10. Let {Xi ; \u03bbji , I} be a direct system of sets indexed by a partially\nordered set I, and let C and G denote the categories of sets and groups,\nrespectively. If F : C \u2192 G is the free functor which associates with every set\nthe free group on that set as basis, then F commutes with direct limit, that\nis,\nF (lim Xi ) = lim F (Xi ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nNote 2.11. As a corollary, suppose that {Gi ; \u03bbji , I} is a directed system of\ngroups, and the sequence\n1 \u2192 Ri \u2192 Fi \u2192 Gi \u2192 1\nis a free presentation for Gi , where Fi (= F (Gi )) is the free group on the\nunderlying set of Gi , for all i \u2208 I. Now using lemma 2.8.(ii), the direct\nlimit of a directed set is an exact functor, and hence kernel-preserving, so by\nLemma 2.10, the sequence\n1 \u2192 lim Ri \u2192 lim Fi \u2192 lim Gi \u2192 1\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nis a free presentation for lim Gi .\n\u2212\u2192\n\nLemma 2.12.

The Main Result\nIn order to deal with V-covering groups of a group G, it is useful to know\nmore relationship between the Baer invariant VM(G) and the V-covering\ngroups of G. In this aspect, to prove our main theorem, first of all we need\nto point the following notes which are the generalization of some parts of an\nimportant theorem of Schur [7, Theorem 2.4.6].\nLemma 3.1. Let V be a variety of groups and G be a group with a free\npresentation 1 \u2192 R \u2192 F \u2192 G \u2192 1. If S is a normal subgroup of F such\nthat\n\nR\nS\nR \u2229 V (F )\n\u223c\n\u00d7\n,\n=\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n\n(\u2217)\n\nthen G\u2217 = F/S is a V-covering group of G.\nProof. Setting A = R/S, so G\u2217 /A \u223c\n= F/R \u223c\n= G and using (*), we have\nA=\n\nR \u223c R/[RV \u2217 F ] \u223c R \u2229 V (F ) \u223c\n=\n=\n= VM(G).\nS\nS/[RV \u2217 F ]\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n\nSince [RV \u2217 F ] \u2286 S, therefore A = R/S \u2286 V \u2217 (F/S) = V \u2217 (G\u2217 ). Also we have\nA=\n\nR\nRS\n=\nS\nS\n\nby(\u2217)\n\n\u2286\n\nF\nV (F )S\n= V ( ) = V (G\u2217 ) .\nS\nS\n\nHence G\u2217 is a V-covering group of G. \u2737\nLemma 3.2. Let V be a variety of groups, let G be a group with a free\n9\n\n\fpresentation 1 \u2192 R \u2192 F \u2192 G \u2192 1, and let G\u2217 be a V-covering group of G.\nThen G\u2217 is a homomorphic image of F/[RV \u2217 F ].\nProof. Let F be free on X and \u03c0 : F \u2192 G be an epimorphism such that\nR = ker(\u03c0). Since G\u2217 is a V-covering group of G, we have the following\nexact sequence\n\u03a6\n\n1 \u2192 A \u2212\u2192 G\u2217 \u2212\u2192 G \u2192 1 ,\nwhere A \u2286 V \u2217 (G\u2217 ) \u2229 V (G\u2217 ) and A \u223c\n= VM(G). Since \u03a6 is surjective, there\nexists lx in G\u2217 such that \u03a6(lx ) = \u03c0(x), for all x \u2208 X. Therefore we have\nG\u2217 =< A, lx |x \u2208 X >= AN,\nwhere N =< lx |x \u2208 X >. Now, by a result of N. S. Hekster [6],\nA \u2286 V (G\u2217 ) = V (AN) = V (N)[AV \u2217 G\u2217 ] \u2286 V (N) \u2286 N .\n(Note that since A \u2286 V \u2217 (G\u2217 ), we have [AV \u2217 G\u2217 ] = 1.) Hence we have\nG\u2217 = N =< lx |x \u2208 X > .\nNow consider the homomorphism \u03a8 : F \u2192 G\u2217 defined by \u03a8(x) = lx , x \u2208 X.\nThen \u03a8 is surjective and \u03c0 = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03a8. Since 1 = \u03c0(R) = \u03a6(\u03a8(R)), we have\n\u03a8(R) \u2286 A, so that\n\u03a8([RV \u2217 F ]) \u2286 [\u03a8(R)V \u2217 G\u2217 ] \u2286 [AV \u2217 G\u2217 ] = 1 .\nIt follows that \u03a8 induces an epimorphism \u03a8 : F/[RV \u2217 F ] \u2212\u2192 G\u2217 . \u2737\nTheorem 3.3. Let V be a Schur-Baer variety and G be a finite group with\na free presentation 1 \u2192 R \u2192 F \u2192 G \u2192 1. If G\u2217 is V-covering group of G,\nthen there exists a normal subgroup S of F such that\nS\nR\nR \u2229 V (F )\n\u223c\n\u00d7\n,\n=\n\u2217\n\u2217\n[RV F ]\n[RV F ]\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n10\n\n\fand so G\u2217 \u223c\n= F/S.\nProof. By the proof of Lemma 3.2 and its notation, for every a \u2208 A, there\nexists x \u2208 F such that a = \u03a8(x). Hence \u03c0(x) = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03a8(x) = \u03a6(\u03a8(x)) =\n\u03a6(a) = 1, so x \u2208 R and thus A \u2286 \u03a8(R). Also in the proof of Lemma 3.2 we\nshowed that \u03a8(R) \u2286 A, so A = \u03a8(R). Next we observe that\n\u03a8(R \u2229 V (F )) \u2286 \u03a8(R) \u2229 \u03a8(V (F )) = A \u2229 V (G\u2217 ) = A .\nTo prove the other inclusion, assume that z = \u03a8(x) = \u03a8(y) for some x \u2208\nV (F ) and y \u2208 R. Then x\u22121 y \u2208 Ker\u03a8, so \u03c0(x\u22121 y) = 1 and therefore x\u22121 y \u2208\nR. It follows that x \u2208 R and z \u2208 \u03a8(R \u2229 V (F )). Thus\nA = \u03a8(R \u2229 V (F )) .\nNow \u03a8 defines an epimorphism\n\u03a81 :\n\nR \u2229 V (F )\n\u2212\u2192 A .\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n\nSince V is a Schur-Baer variety, A \u223c\n= VM(G) = R \u2229 V (F )/[RV \u2217 F ], and G\nis finite, so by Theorem 1.3 A is also finite. Thus the above epimorphism is\nisomorphism. Now, put S = Ker(\u03a8) \u2229 R. Then clearly S \u2702 F and S/[RV \u2217 F ]\nis the kernel of the restriction of \u03a8 to R/[RV \u2217 F ], i.e.\n\u03a82 :\n\nR\n\u2212\u2192 A .\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n\nNow we can consider the following short exact sequence\n1\u2192\n\nS\nR\n\u03a82\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nA \u2192 1. (\u2217\u2217)\n\u2217\n\u2217\n[RV F ]\n[RV F ]\n\nSince \u03a81 is an isomorphism, so we have \u03a82 \u25e6 \u03a81\n\n\u22121\n\n= 1A , and hence the above\n\nshort exact sequence splits. Therefore we have\nR\nS\nS\nR \u2229 V (F )\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u2704<\n.\n= A\u2704<\n=\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n[RV F ]\n[RV F ]\n[RV F ]\n[RV \u2217 F ]\n11\n\n\fBut clearly R \u2229 V (F )/[RV \u2217 F ] \u2702 R/[RV \u2217 F ], so the above semidirect product\nis actually a direct product. Now, by Lemma 3.1, F/S is a V-covering group\nof G.\nLet \u03b8 : F/S \u2212\u2192 G\u2217 be the homomorphism induced by \u03a8. Since \u03a8\nis surjective and \u03a8(R) = A, \u03b8 is surjective and \u03b8(R/S) = A. However\n|F/S| = |G\u2217 |, so \u03b8 becomes an isomorphism i.e. G\u2217 \u223c\n= F/S. \u2737\nNote that this generalization of the Schur Theorem, has been posed and\nproved by M. R. R. Moghaddam and A. R. Salemkar [16], but it seems that\nthere are some missing points in their proof, specially the splitting of the\nexact sequence (**), and so the condition of being Schur-Baer for the variety\nV.\nLemma 3.4. The direct limit with a directed index set, as we mentioned in\nDefinition 2.5, preserves the finite direct product, that is, for any two directed\nsystems of groups {Ai ; \u03bbji , I} and {Bi ; \u03bcji , I}, we have\nlim(Ai \u00d7 Bi ) = lim Ai \u00d7 lim Bi .\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nProof. Firstly, for any i \u2208 I, we have the following split exact sequence with\nnatural homomorphisms\n1 \u2192 Ai \u2192 Ai \u00d7 Bi \u2192 Bi \u2192 1.\nNow using Lemma 2.8(ii), the direct limit preserves exactness and so we have\nthe following exact sequence which is also split\n1 \u2192 lim Ai \u2192 lim(Ai \u00d7 Bi ) \u2192 lim Bi \u2192 1.\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nOn the other hand, we know that the direct limit is kernel-preserving and so\npreserves normal subgroups. Hence lim Bi is a normal subgroup of lim(Ai \u00d7 Bi )\n\u2212\u2192\n\nand so the result holds. \u2737\n\n12\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\fNow, in order to state and prove the main result of the paper, we need\nto explain the concept of an induced directed system of V-covering groups\nwhich we use in the main theorem. Let V be a Schur-Baer variety, and let\n{Gi ; \u03bbji , I} be a directed system of finite groups. suppose that G\u2217i is a Vcovering group for Gi , for all i \u2208 I. Now if we consider the sequence\n1 \u2192 Ri \u2192 Fi \u2192 Gi \u2192 1\nas a free presentation, then using Theorem 3.3 there exists a normal subgroup\nSi of Fi in such a way that G\u2217i = Fi /Si and specially satisfies the following\nrelation:\n\nRi\nSi\nRi \u2229 V (Fi )\n\u223c\n\u00d7\n.\n=\n\u2217\n\u2217\n[Ri V Fi ]\n[Ri V Fi ]\n[Ri V \u2217 Fi ]\n\n(\u2217)\n\nBy these notations, for any i \u2264 j in I, there exists an induced homomorphism\nb j commutes the following diagram\n\u03bb\ni\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 Ri \u2212\u2192 Fi \u2212\u2192 Gi \u2212\u2192 1\n\u2193b\u03bbi\n\nj\n\nj\n\n\u2193\u03bbi\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 Rj \u2212\u2192 Fj \u2212\u2192 Gj \u2212\u2192 1.\nb j maps\nThe commutativity of this diagram, implies that the homomorphism \u03bb\ni\n\nb j (R \u2229 V (F )) \u2286 R \u2229 V (F ). Hence if \u03bb\nb j maps S into S ,\nRi into Rj and so \u03bb\ni\ni\nj\nj\ni\nj\ni\ni\n\nwe will have the following induced homomorphism, for any i \u2264 j:\ne j : G\u2217 =\n\u03bb\ni\ni\n\nFj\nFi\n\u2212\u2192 G\u2217j = ,\nSi\nSj\n\ne j , I}, called an induced directed system\nwhich forms the directed system {G\u2217i ; \u03bb\ni\n\nof covering groups.\nNote that in general, any family of covering groups of a directed system\nof groups is not necessarily an induce one. For example we consider the\ngroup Z2 \u00d7 Z2 with two non-isomorphic covering groups D8 and Q8 . So it\n13\n\n\ftakes the trivial directed system {Gi ; \u03bbji , N} which Gi = Z2 \u00d7 Z2 and \u03bbji to\nbe identity, for any i, j \u2208 N. Now if we take the family of covering groups\n{G\u2217i ; i \u2208 N} such that G\u22172i = D8 and G\u22172i+1 = Q8 . Then {G\u2217i ; i \u2208 I} does\nnot form induced directed system.\nTheorem 3.5. Suppose that V is a Schur-Baer variety. If {Gi ; \u03bbji , I} is a\ndirected system of finite groups with an induced system of V-covering groups\ne j , I}, as we mentioned above, then the group G\u2217 = lim G\u2217 is a V{G\u2217i ; \u03bb\ni\ni\n\u2212\u2192\n\ncovering group for G = lim Gi .\n\u2212\u2192\n\nProof. Using the isomorphism (\u2217) and Lemma 3.4, we have\nlim\n\u2212\u2192\n\nRi\nSi\nRi \u2229 V (Fi )\n\u223c\n\u00d7 lim\n.\n= lim\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2212\u2192 [Ri V \u2217 Fi ]\n\u2212\u2192 [Ri V Fi ]\n[Ri V Fi ]\n\n(1)\n\nAlso by Lemma 2.8(ii), we have\nlim\n\u2212\u2192\n\nlim Ri\nRi\n\u2212\u2192\n=\n,\n[Ri V \u2217 Fi ]\nlim[Ri V \u2217 Fi ]\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nlim\n\u2212\u2192\n\nlim\n(Ri \u2229 V (Fi ))\nlim\nSi\nSi\nRi \u2229 V (Fi )\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n=\nand\nlim\n=\n.

If we omit the condition of being directed, then the free\nproduct of any two groups A, B as a particular direct limit of groups which\nits index set is not directed (see [20]), should have a covering group with\nthe structure A\u2217 \u2217 B \u2217 , where A\u2217 and B \u2217 are covering groups of A and B,\nrespectively. But this is a contradiction, when we choose A with nontrivial\nSchur multiplier. Since in this case, if A\u2217 \u2217 B \u2217 is a covering group of A \u2217 B,\nthen by Definition 2.4, we will have\nM(A \u2217 B) \u223c\n= N with N \u2286 Z(A\u2217 \u2217 B \u2217 ) \u2229 (A\u2217 \u2217 B \u2217 )\u2032 = 1.\nBut using a result of Miller [13], we have M(A \u2217 B) \u223c\n= M(A) \u00d7 M(B) 6= 1,\nwhich is a contradiction.\n\n4. Applications\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, we have the structure of covering\nor generalized covering groups for some famous products of finitely many\ngroups, such as finite direct and finite regular products of finite groups [4,24].\nIn this section, as an important application of the main result, we present a\ngeneralized covering group for the above products when their index sets are\narbitrary. Also the main result of this note may have an application in the\nsense that if one wants to find a generalized covering group for an arbitrary\ngroup, one only needs to find a generalized covering group for every finitely\ngenerated subgroups of it.\nFirstly, by a result of Schur [22], for a finite nilpotent group G and it's\nall Sylow subgroups S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn , we have\nM(G) \u223c\n= M(S1 ) \u00d7 M(S2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 M(Sn ).\nUsing this property and also the definition of covering group, we deduce the\nfollowing straightforward point.\n15\n\n\fCorollary 4.1. Let G be a finite nilpotent group with it's all Sylow subgroups\nS1 , S2 , . . . , Sn , and let Si\u2217 be a covering group for Si . Then the group G\u2217 =\nS1\u2217 \u00d7 S2\u2217 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sn\u2217 is a covering group of G.\nNow using the main result of this paper, we conclude the generalization\nof the above note, as follows.\nCorollary 4.2. Let G be a torsion nilpotent group with it's all Sylow subgroups Si , for i \u2208 I. Suppose Si\u2217 is a covering group of Si , for all i \u2208 I, then\nthe group G\u2217 =\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nSi\u2217 is a covering group for G.\n\nProof. First, note that every torsion nilpotent group, is the direct product\nof it's Sylow subgroups and so G =\n{\n\nQ\u00d7\n\nK\nj\u2208J Sj ; \u03bbJ },\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nSi . Now if we consider the system\n\nwhere J \u2286 K are finite subsets of I and \u03bbK\nJ is the inclusion\n\nmap, then the group G =\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nSi is the direct limit of this system which is\n\nobviously a directed system.\nClearly we have the induced directed system on covering groups of\n\nQ\u00d7\n\nj\u2208J\n\nSj 's\n\ne K , as follows:\nwith the morphisms \u03bb\nJ\n\n{\n\n\u00d7\nY\nj\u2208J\n\neK }\nSj\u2217 ; \u03bb\nJ\n\nf inite\n\nJ \u2286 I\n\n.\n\ne K are clearly inclusion maps and so the direct\nNote that the morphisms \u03bb\nJ\n\nproduct G\u2217 =\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nSi\u2217 will be considered as the direct limit of this system\n\nand hence, using Theorem 3.5, the proof is completed. \u2737\nAlso by a result of G. Ellis [3], for a finite nilpotent group G and it's all\nSylow subgroups P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn , we have\nNc M(G) \u223c\n= Nc M(S1 ) \u00d7 Nc M(S2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Nc M(Sn ).\nUsing this property and similar arguments, we deduce the similar corollary\nfor an Nc -covering group of a torsion nilpotent group as follows:\nCorollary 4.3. Let G be a torsion nilpotent group with it's all Sylow sub16\n\n\fgroups Pi , for i \u2208 I. Suppose Pi\u2217 is an Nc -covering group of Pi , for all i \u2208 I.\nThen the group G\u2217 =\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nPi\u2217 is an Nc -covering group for G.\n\nWe next establish the structure of a covering group for the direct and\nregular products of arbitrary many of groups which are generalizations of\nresults of J. Wiegold [24] and W. Haebich [4].\nCorollary 4.4. Let {Ai }i\u2208I be an arbitrary family of finite groups and suppose that A\u2217i is a covering group of Ai , for any i \u2208 I. Then the second\nnilpotent product of Ai 's, is a covering group of\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nAi .\n\nProof. First, we recall that the second nilpotent product of a family of groups\nas {A\u2217i }i\u2208I , is defined to be\nQ\u2217\n\n2\n\n\u2217\nY\n\nA\u2217i\n\ni\u2208I\n\n=\n\n\u03b33 (\n\n\u2217\ni\u2208I Ai\n\u2217\ni\u2208I Ai ) \u2229\n\nQ\u2217\n\n[A\u2217i ]\u2217\n\n,\n\nwhere the subgroup [A\u2217i ]\u2217 is the kernel of the natural epimorphism\n\u03c0:\n\nQ\u2217\n\ni\u2208I\n\nA\u2217i \u2192\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nA\u2217i , which has also the following structure:\n[A\u2217i ]\u2217 = h [Ai , Aj ] ; i 6= j i\n\nQ\u2217\n\ni\u2208I\n\nA\u2217i\n\n.\n\nNow similar to the proof of Corollary 4.2, we consider the directed system\n{\n\nQ\u00d7\n\nAj ; \u03bbK\nJ } of finite direct products and the inclusion maps, with the\n\nj\u2208J\n\ngroup A =\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nAi as the direct limit of this system.\n\nBy a result of J. Wiegold [24], the group\nof\n\nQ\u00d7\n\nj\u2208J\n\nAj , where J is finite. Consider {\n\nQ\u2217\n2\n\ni\u2208J\n\nQ\u22172\n\ni\u2208J\n\nA\u2217i is a covering group\n\ne K } as a directed sysA\u2217i ; \u03bb\nJ\n\n2\ne K is clearly the inclusion map, \u03bb\ne K : Q\u2217 A\u2217 \u0592\u2192\ntem, where the morphism \u03bb\nJ\nJ\nj\u2208J j\n\nQ\u22172\n\nk\u2208K\n\nA\u2217k . Clearly A\u2217 =\n\nQ\u22172\n\ni\u2208I\n\nA\u2217i is the direct limit of the last induced directed\n\nsystem and so using Theorem 3.5 is a covering group for\n\nQ\u00d7\n\ni\u2208I\n\nAi . \u2737\n\nNotation and Corollary 4.5. Let G be a regular product of it's finite\nsubgroups Ai , i \u2208 I, where I considered as an ordered set. For each i \u2208 I,\nLi denotes a fixed covering group for Ai and consider the exact sequence\n17\n\n\f\u03bd\n\n1 \u2192 Mi \u2192 Li \u2192i Ai \u2192 1 such that\nMi \u2286 Z(Li ) \u2229 L\u2032i and Mi \u223c\n= M(Ai ),\nwhere Mi is a normal subgroup of Li , and M(Ai ) is the Schur multiplier of\nAi . Assume that A =\n\nQ\u2217\n\ni\u2208I\n\nAi and L =\n\nQ\u2217\n\ni\u2208I\n\nLi are free products of Ai 's and\n\nLi 's, respectively. We denote by \u03bd the natural homomorphism from L onto\nA induced by the \u03bdi 's. Also, if \u03c8 is the natural homomorphism from A onto\nG induced by the identity map on each Ai ,\nL=\n\n\u2217\nY\n\n\u03bd\n\nLi \u2212\u2192 A =\n\ni\u2208I\n\n\u2217\nY\n\n\u03c8\n\nAi \u2212\u2192 G \u2192 1 ,\n\ni\u2208I\n\nthen we denote by H the kernel of \u03c8 and set\nJ = \u03bd \u22121 (H) \u2229 [LLi ],\n\nn\nY\n\nN=\n\n[Mi , Lj ]L ,\n\nM =(\n\nn\nY\n\nMi )J.\n\ni=1\n\ni,j=1\n\ni6=j\n\nFinally, L\u0304 and M\u0304 denote the images of L and M under the natural homomorphism L \u2192 L/N[J, L], respectively. Then there is an exact sequence\n1 \u2192 M\u0304 \u2192 L\u0304 \u2192 G \u2192 1,\nsuch that M\u0304 \u2286 Z(L\u0304) \u2229 [L\u0304, L\u0304] and M\u0304 \u223c\n= M(G). In particular, L\u0304 is a covering\ngroup of G.\nProof. First of all, we note that the group G is called the regular product\nof it's subgroups Ai 's, with the ordered set I, if the following two conditions\nhold:\nG = hAi ; i \u2208 Ii\n\nAi \u2229 Abi = 1 (\u2200i \u2208 I),\n\n,\n\nwhere Abi is defined to be the group\nAbi =\n\nY\nj\u2208J,j6=i\n\n18\n\nAG\nj .\n\n\fNow similar to the previous notes and using the definition, we clearly\nconsider the directed system on finite regular products of Ai 's, with inclusion\nmaps. As we saw before, it induces a directed system on their covering\ngroups, with induced homomorphisms which are also inclusion.\nBy a result of W. Haebich [4], the corollary holds for any finite index set\nI. Now, using Theorem 3.5, it is easy to check that the group L\u0304 as a direct\nlimit of the induced system is a covering group of the regular products of\nAi 's which is considered as a direct limit of the first system. \u2737\nNote that the above theorem is in fact a generalization of the Haebich's\nformula for a covering group of any finite regular product of finite groups [4].\nHowever the main proof of Haebich could be easily generalized to the regular\nproduct of infinitely many of finite groups, but our proof as an application\nof the main result is another proof to this generalization.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to thank the referee for giving attention to the\npaper and spending a good amount of time.\nThis research was in part supported by a grant from Center of Excellence\nin Analysis on Algebraic Structures, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
