One possibility is that MSP coherent pulsations are smeared out by rapidly changing orbital Doppler shifts in short period binaries. Modern accelerated signal search techniques have not\nbeen applied systematically to many LMXBs so it\nis possible that there are millisecond pulsations in\nthem that have gone unnoticed.\nThere are many things that we can learn from\nsearching for more examples of direct pulsations\nfrom LMXBs. Coherent pulsations give the precise rotation rate of the neutron star and test the\nconnection between recycled MSPs and LMXBs.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the great scientific expectations when\nthe Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) was\nlaunched in 1995 was the discovery of coherent pulsations from low-mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs). At present, only five accreting millisecond pulsars in LMXBs are known. All five\nare faint transient sources for which the pulsations at the spin period of the pulsar were discovered during outbursts (Wijnands & van der Klis\n1 Department of Physics, McGill University, Montreal,\nQC H3A 2T8\n2 E. O. Hulburt Center for Space Research, Code 7655,\nNaval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375\n3 Department of Mathematics and Statistics , McGill\nUniversity, Montreal, QC H3A 2K6\n\n1\n\n\fThey help constrain the models of kHz QPOs and\nburst oscillations. Timing of the coherent pulses\nwould also allow measurements of the accretion\ntorques, the orbital parameters, and potentially\nthe companion masses. In addition, in combination with X-ray and optical spectra, pulse timing can give information about the compactness\nand the equation of state of the neutron star. Finally, setting stringent upper limits on coherent\npulsations in several sources in a variety of spectral states will impose constraints on the possible\nmechanism for suppression of the predicted coherent pulsations mentioned above. For these reasons, we have started a large-scale archival RXTE\nsearch for coherent pulsations from LMXBs, the\nfirst target of which is the ultracompact globular\ncluster LMXB 4U 1820\u221230.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, we describe the general properties of\n4U 1820\u221230. In Section 2, we describe the observations as well as the procedure we used to search\nfor coherent pulsations. In Section 3, we describe\nour search techniques and the methods used to\ninvestigate the obtained candidate pulsation frequencies. In Section 4, we describe our results\nand derive our upper limits on possible coherent\npulsations. Finally, in Sections 5 and 6, we discuss\nthe implications of our findings and summarize.\n1.1.\n\nlarge range of accretion rates in case the pulsations become visible only in some. In the low\nluminosity state, regular Type I bursts are seen\n\u00b123 days around the minimum luminosity (Chou\n& Grindlay 2001). It is notable that burst oscillations have not been observed from this source.\nIn the low state, 4U 1820\u221230 has also shown\nan extremely energetic superburst (Strohmayer &\nBrown 2002). This bursting behaviour confirms\nthat the observed luminosity variations actually\ncorrespond to changes in the local accretion rate\nat the surface, and not just a geometrical effect,\nsince they affect the bursting properties of the\nsource. 4U 1820\u221230 also exhibits a variety of\nspectral states as can be seen from Figure 1. Several low frequency QPOs (Stella, Priedhorsky, &\nWhite 1987; Dotani et al. 1989; Wijnands, van der\nKlis, & Rijkhorst 1999). as well as two peaks of\nkHz QPOs (Smale, Zhang, & White 1997; Zhang\net al. 1998; Kaaret et al. 1999) have been observed\nfrom this source. The separation between the two\npeaks is 275\u00b18 Hz (van der Klis 1999). If the secondary star in the system is a white dwarf, its mass\nis estimated to be 0.058 to 0.078 M\u2299 (Rappaport\net al. 1987). If the secondary is a main sequence\nstar, the upper limit on its mass is 0.3 M\u2299 (Arons\n& King 1993).\nOf all known LMXBs, we searched 4U 1820\u221230\nfirst for several reasons. First, many high-timeresolution, long data sets are available in the\narchives. Second, the presence of kHz QPOs\nin this source may indicate favorable conditions\nfor detecting pulsations. Third, its extremely\nshort orbital period allows the use of the phase\nmodulation search technique. This technique is\nmost sensitive and provides the biggest increase\nin sensitivity over previous methods when the\nobservations are longer than two complete binary orbits (Ransom, Cordes, & Eikenberry 2003).\nThe precisely known and short orbital period also\nmakes 4U 1820\u221230 one of only two LMXBs that\ncan be searched using our fully coherent orbitalparameter-fitting search technique on a reasonable\ntime scale.\nThe source 4U 1820\u221230 has previously been\nsearched for coherent pulsations at frequencies under 50 Hz by Wood et al. (1991) and by Vaughan\net al. (1994). Their upper limit on the pulsed\nfraction for sinusoidal pulses was 0.6% (95% confidence level), and 1.1% (99% confidence level) re-\n\nCharacteristics of 4U 1820\u221230\n\nThe source 4U 1820\u221230 is an atoll LMXB in\nglobular cluster NGC 6624 (Stella, Priedhorsky,\n& White 1987). It has an orbital binary period of\n685 s (11.4 min). The orbital period was identified to be the period of a nearly sinusoidal X-ray\nluminosity modulation with an amplitude of 2%\nto 3% and no strong energy dependence (Stella\net al. 1987; Smale et al. 1987; Sansom et al. 1989;\nTan et al. 1991; van der Klis et al. 1993; van\nder Klis et al. 1993; Chou & Grindlay 2001). A\n16% modulation at a period of 687\u00b12.4 s was\nalso seen in the UV band (Anderson et al. 1997).\nThis is the shortest known binary orbital period\nin an LMXB. 4U 1820\u221230 undergoes a regular\n\u223c176 day accretion cycle (Priedhorsky & Terrell\n1984) switching between high and low luminosity\nstates, which differ by a factor of \u223c3 in their luminosity (Stella et al. 1987). This luminosity variation makes 4U 1820\u221230 an attractive target for\nour search because it allows us to sample a fairly\n2\n\n\fspectively. Our searches cover a much wider frequency range, including, for the first time, the kHz\nrange. This is particularly important since likely\nspin frequencies are near 275 Hz or 550 Hz, based\non the kHz QPOs (van der Klis 1999; Chakrabarty\net al. 2003).\n2.\n\nshorter lists of events. We then binned the events\ninto time series of different time resolutions (see\nTable 2) and searched them for pulsations using\nthree types of searches which we summarize in Sections 3.1.1, 3.2.1, and 3.3.1. In Sections 3.1.2,\n3.2.2, and 3.3.2, we explain how we used the three\nsearches to obtain candidate pulsation frequencies.\nFinally, in Sections 3.1.3, 3.2.3, and 3.3.3, we explain the methods we used to investigate the obtained lists of candidate pulsation frequencies. All\nthe data sets were processed on the 52-node dual\n1.4 GHz Athlon-based Beowulf cluster operated by\nthe McGill University Pulsar Group.\n\nObservations and Preliminary Data\nPreparation\n\nWe searched 34 archival RXTE PCA observations collected between 1996 and 2002 (see Table 1). All the observations were available in event\nmodes with time resolutions of \u223c125 \u03bcs. 32 of the\nobservations had a total time on source > 10 ks.\nThe longest of these was 29 ks with a total time\non source of 16 ks. Some of the observations were\nsegments of longer ones which allowed us to concatenate and analyse them together. The longest\nof the concatenated observations was 77.5 ks with\na total time on source of 46.5 ks.\nFor each observation, we downloaded the files\nof raw events (one file for each RXTE orbit). The\nduration of an RXTE orbit (including Earth occultation time) is \u223c5.7 ks. We filtered the files by selecting only events where the source elevation was\n> 10\u25e6 , the pointing offset was < 0.02\u25e6 , and where\na minimum number of operational PCUs were on\n(see Table 1). We then transformed the arrival\ntimes of the events to the solar system barycenter\nusing the 'FTOOL'1 FAXBARY. The barycentering\nwas necessary to remove the effects of the spacecraft and Earth motions. We then split the data\ninto four energy bands: Soft (2-5 keV), Medium\n(5-10 keV), Hard (10-20 keV), and Wide (2-20\nkeV), in order to attempt to maximize the signalto-noise ratio of the unknown pulsations. This\nprocessing used custom Python scripts to call the\nstandard 'FTOOLs'. At the end of the preliminary\ndata preparation we obtained four lists of events\n(photon arrival times) for every RXTE orbit in every observation, each list corresponding to one of\nthe four energy bands.\n3.\n\n3.1.\n3.1.1.\n\nAcceleration Searches\nThe Search Technique\n\nThis is the method traditionally used to compensate for the effects of orbital motion (e.g.,\nJohnston & Kulkarni 1991): a time series is\nstretched or compressed appropriately to account for a trial constant frequency derivative\n(i.e. constant acceleration), Fourier transformed,\nand then searched for pulsations. We used a\nFourier-domain variant of this technique based\non matched filtering techniques which includes\nFourier interpolation and harmonic summing of 1,\n2, 4, and 8 harmonics to improve the sensitivity to\nnon-sinusoidal pulsations (Ransom, Eikenberry, &\nMiddleditch 2002).\nAcceleration searches work best for systems\nwhere the orbital period \u2243 10\u00d7the observation\nlength. Acceleration searches are not optimal for\nsystems like 4U 1820\u221230 where the orbital period\nis shorter than the observation duration: the acceleration is not constant over the length of our\ntime series. However, we chose not to run searches\non time series shorter than 600 s (see Table 2) because we required a large number of photons. So\nwhile we did not expect acceleration searches to\nfind pulsations, we still used them because they\nare included in our standard search pipeline. Also,\nthe segmented acceleration searches that we ran,\neven though they were not short enough for the\nacceleration to be constant, can still be useful if a\nstrong pulsed signal appears for a short period of\ntime perhaps because the 'weather' on the surface\nbriefly cleared and the pulsations appeared.\n\nData Analysis\n\nAfter we prepared the RXTE-orbit-long lists of\nevents, we concatenated them into observationlong lists of events, and also broke them into much\n1 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/\n\n3\n\n\f3.1.2.\n\nquency of the signal f , the frequency derivative f \u0307,\nand the significance of the detection \u03c3. Using the\nreturned values for f and f \u0307, we folded all acceleration candidates with \u03c3 > 3. Our folding software\nhad the ability to fine tune the search in the f\nand f \u0307 directions. We also folded all the candidates\nwith \u03c3 > 2 that appeared in 15 or more observations to within 0.1% of their frequency. 0.1% was\nchosen because the frequency modulation caused\nby the the orbit of 4U 1820\u221230 will not cause f to\ndeviate by more than 0.1% (see Section 3.2.1). All\nthe folded candidates showed noise-like profiles.\n\nObtaining Candidate Pulsation Frequencies\n\nTo run acceleration searches, we first binned the\nlists of events which we obtained in the data preparation into time series of different lengths and time\nresolutions (see Table 2). We performed an FFT\non each of the time series and fed the result into\na local red noise reduction algorithm which divides the FFT into continuous intervals the size\nof which increases logarithmically with frequency.\nThe power in every bin of every interval is divided\nby the mean power in that interval. This produces\nFFTs that have a reduced signature of red noise.\nWe then ran the acceleration searches on the obtained FFTs, searching for a maximum constant\nacceleration of amax < 5.1 \u00d7 1010 /(f T 2 obs ) m/s2 ,\nwhere f is the frequency of the detected pulsations\nin Hz, and Tobs is the integration time in seconds.\nFor a signal of period 3 ms and an integration\ntime of 600 s, this acceleration is 425 m/s2 . This\nnumber was chosen because it corresponds to the\nmaximum length of a trial Fourier response template used in the search that would fit in the cache\nmemory of the available machines. The maximum\npossible line of sight acceleration of 4U 1820\u221230\nis amax (x) = 25240.6 \u00d7 x m/s2 where x is the\nprojected semi-major axis of the binary in lightseconds. For a companion mass of 0.05 M\u2299 and\nan inclination angle of 60\u25e6 , x = 13.4 lt-ms, and\namax = 339 m/s2 .\nUsing acceleration searches, we searched for\nsignals with an equivalent Gaussian significance\n\u03c3 > 2 (Groth 1975) and with frequencies between\n0.0375 Hz and 2048 Hz. We estimated \u03c3 based on\nthe probability distribution of sums of powers in\na normalized power spectrum (Groth 1975; Ransom et al. 2002). In order to correctly determine\nthe significance of a candidate, we also took into\naccount the number of independent trials in the\nsearches (Ransom et al. 2002). Sometimes we increased the lower limit on the searched frequency\nto 1/8 Hz in order to eliminate the large number of\nlow-frequency candidate oscillations that the red\nnoise reduction routine did not successfully eliminate.\n3.1.3.\n\n3.2.\n3.2.1.\n\nPhase Modulation Searches\nThe Search Technique\n\nIn order to analyze longer observations we used\nthe new 'phase-modulation' or 'sideband' search\ntechnique described by Ransom et al. (2003)(see\nalso Jouteux et al. 2002). This technique relies\non the fact that if the observation time is longer\nthan the orbital period (Tobs >> Porb ), the orbit\nphase-modulates the pulsar's spin frequency, resulting in a family of evenly spaced sidebands in\nthe frequency domain, centered around the intrinsic pulsar signal for circular orbits (see for example Figure 2). The width of the region occupied\nby the sidebands is 4\u03c0f x(Tobs /Porb ) Fourier bins,\nwhere f is the frequency of the signal and x is the\nprojected semi-major axis. The constant spacing\nbetween the sidebands is Tobs /Porb Fourier bins.\nA phase modulation search is conducted by taking short FFTs of portions of the full power spectrum of an observation. The short FFTs cover\noverlapping portions of various lengths (to account\nfor the unknown semi-major axis of the LMXB)\nover all the Fourier frequency range of the original power spectrum (to account for the unknown\npulsation period). The secondary power spectra\nare then searched for harmonically related peaks\nindicating regularly spaced sidebands (to detect\nthe orbital period of the LMXB). Our phase modulation search included Fourier interpolation and\nharmonic summing of up to 4 harmonics of the orbital periods. This particular harmonic summing\naccounts for non-circular orbits, but not for nonsinusoidal pulsations. A detection provides initial\nestimates of the LMXB spin period, the orbital\nperiod, and the projected radius of the orbit. For\ninteresting candidate oscillations, these estimates\n\nCandidate Follow-up\n\nWhen our acceleration searches detect a candidate oscillation, they return values for the fre-\n\n4\n\n\fare then refined by generating a series of complexvalued template responses (i.e. matched filters for\nthe Fourier domain response of an orbitally modulated signal) to correlate with the original Fourier\namplitudes (Ransom et al. 2003).\n3.2.2.\n\ninformation, a pulsation period, an orbital period, and \u03c3. We know from simulation that when\na phase modulation search detects a signal with\npulsed fraction equal to or greater than our upper\nlimit calculated in Section 4.1, the pulsation period of the signal appears many times in the list of\ncandidates obtained for that data set due to overlapping numerous short FFTs. Depending on the\nstrength of the signal, there can also be a jump in\nthe significance (measured in \u03c3) between the candidate oscillation corresponding to the real signal\nand the candidate with the next smaller significance. When this happens, if the list of candidates\nis arranged in order of decreasing \u03c3, the real signal\nappears at the beginning of the list as an outlier\nwith a singularly large \u03c3.\nWhen examining the phase modulation search\ncandidates, we first extracted the candidates\nwhose orbital period was 685 s within uncertainties. Among the extracted candidates, we searched\nfor oscillation periods that appeared several times\nin any given observation. There were none. Also\namong the extracted candidates, we searched for\ncandidates whose pulsation period appeared in\nthe candidate lists of more than 10 observations\nto within a fractional period of 0.1%. There were\nalso none. The 0.1% was a generous percentage\nconsidering that the uncertainties in the candidate\npulsation periods were much smaller. Finally, we\nsearched for outliers within the candidate lists.\nWe did not find any.\n\nObtaining Candidate Pulsation Frequencies\n\nTo run the phase modulation searches, we first\nconcatenated the orbit-long lists of events which\nwe had obtained at the end of the preliminary data\npreparation into observation-long lists of events.\nWe then binned both the the observation-long and\nthe orbit-long lists into time series (see Table 2).\nWe performed an FFT on each, and fed the results into the local red noise reduction routine. We\nran the phase modulation searches on the original\nFFTs as well as on the red noise-reduced FFTs.\nThe obtained lists of candidate oscillations were\nalmost identical: most of the candidates were millisecond pulsations so the red noise reduction did\nnot affect them.\nIn order for the phase modulation search to detect a phase modulated signal, the short FFTs described in Section 3.2.1 must overlap at least a part\nof the phase modulated signal. When running the\nphase modulation searches on the observation-long\ndata sets, we used the range of short FFT lengths\nderived in Ransom et al. (2003) that was appropriate for a wide range of orbital parameters: from 64\nto 131072 bins. As we explained in Section 3.2.1,\nthe spread of the phase modulated signal in the\nFourier domain is proportional to xf where x is\nthe projected semi-major axis in light-seconds and\nf is the intrinsic frequency of the signal. Because\nthe maximum x for 4U 1820\u221230 is small (for the\nupper-limit companion mass of 0.3 M\u2299 and an\ninclination angle of 90\u25e6 , x = 1.02 lt-s), the sizes of\nthe short FFTs that we used would allow us to detect signals up to our Nyquist frequency (2048 Hz).\nWe used a smaller range of short FFT sizes when\nwe ran the phase-modulation search on the orbitlong data sets (64 to 32768 bins), and therefore\nwere most sensitive to signal frequencies . 1 kHz\nfor all possible values of the companion mass.\n3.2.3.\n\n3.3.\n3.3.1.\n\nOrbital-Parameter-Fitting Coherent\nSearches\nThe Search Technique\n\nIn this search, the source's motion is modelled\nas a circular orbit. This is because LMXB accreting systems are known to have nearly circular orbits (Zahn 1977). Hence, we ignored the small errors due to a non-zero eccentricity. Three parameters are required to specify a particular circular\norbit model: the orbital period Porb , the projected\nsemi\u2013major axis in light-seconds x \u2261 a sin(i)/c\n(where a is the real semi-major axis, i is the inclination of the orbit, and c is the speed of light),\nand the orbital phase at the start of an observation \u03c6 = 2\u03c0(Tstart \u2212 To )/Porb (where Tstart is the\nstart time of the observation, and To is the time\nof the last ascending node before Tstart ). Once\n\nCandidate Follow-up\n\nFor every candidate oscillation it finds, our\nphase modulation search returns, along with other\n\n5\n\n\ftional radiation, estimated to be \u223c 0.00018 s yr\u22121\n(Wagoner 1975), fell within the above uncertainties. We used Porb = 685.014 s when we ran our\norbital-parameter-fitting search on 4U 1820\u221230.\nThe maximum plausible x, assuming the companion is a degenerate star is 0.024 lt-s (this\ncorresponds to a companion mass of 0.078M\u2299\nfor an edge-on inclination). With our orbitalparameter-fitting search, we searched up to an\nxmax of 0.032 lt-s (corresponding to a companion mass of 0.106M\u2299 for an edge-on inclination.\nLarger companion masses are allowed for smaller\ninclinations). We also set an upper bound on\nsearched pulsation frequency of fmax = 1250 Hz\nto save computer time. If a set of trial orbital\nparameters corresponds exactly to the real orbital\nparameters of 4U 1820\u221230, our orbital-parameterfitting search collects successfully all the power\ndue to the signal. If our trial orbital parameters are slightly off, there will be a sensitivity loss.\nWhen we ran the search, we tuned the parameter\nsteps to accept up to 50% loss in signal power at\nthe maximum frequency. (As frequency decreases\nor the error in the size of the orbit decreases, this\nloss decreases to very near zero; see Section 4.2).\nBased on calculations by in Middleditch (2004),\nand using the above known properties of 4U 1820\u221230\nand the above mentioned maximum loss in signal\npower, we calculated that the error in a trial x\nshould be no more than 0.000143 lt-s (see Section\n4.2 for details). With that in mind, we generated\nan optimal grid of trial orbital parameter sets.\nThe grid contained several thousands of points\n(see Section 4.2)\nFor each set of trial orbital parameters, we ran a\nseparate search. We time-shifted the event data,\nto reflect the trial orbital parameters. We then\nbinned it at a resolution of 0.244 ms and computed its Fourier transform. We applied our local red-noise reduction code and fed the result to\nour standard acceleration search code with a maximum acceleration of zero and an increased significance threshold (i.e. \u03c3 > 3); keeping in mind\nthat the \u03c3 returned by the acceleration search after subtracting the time-shifts is an overestimate\nof the real \u03c3 of the signal. This is because the\norbital-parameter-fitting coherent search fails to\ntake into account the number of times accelerations searches were run. The resulting list of candidate oscillations was then stored and the process\n\na set of trial orbital parameters is specified, it is\nstraightforward to remove the shifts that the orbit\nwould introduce in the arrival time of every photon. If the set of trial orbital parameters matches\nthe real orbital parameters of the source, the resulting time series will contain the signature of an\nisolated pulsar that can be found using a standard\npulsation search with no acceleration.\nFor 4U 1820\u221230, the orbital period is accurately known, but the other two parameters, x and\n\u03c6, must be searched. In Arons & King (1993), a\nmaximum likely value xmax for x is estimated, but\nthe orbital phase is completely unknown. The sensitivity of detection to errors in the orbital parameters increases with pulsation frequency (see Section 4.2), so one must also estimate the highest\nlikely pulsation frequency fmax . From the sensitivity calculations in Section 4.2 we know that the\nnumber of sets of trial orbital parameters increases\nas (xmax fmax )2 . For 4U 1820\u221230, reasonable estimates of these numbers can be provided (see next\nSection), and the effort required to search the data\nis feasible.\n3.3.2.\n\nObtaining Candidate Pulsation Frequencies\n\nThe method used to run searches by orbitalparameter-fitting is essentially the same as the\nstandard method for running acceleration searches:\nthe arrival times of the photons were time-shifted\n(this time to account for a variable orbital acceleration), and the resulting data sets were searched\nfor isolated pulsar signatures.\nIn particular,\nno matched filtering in the Fourier domain was\ndone. The current implementation requires about\n2000 hr to search a typical 4U 1820\u221230 observation on our computers. This is why it was necessary to limit the number of observations on which\nto run the search.\nChou & Grindlay (2001) did a folded period\nsearching of the combined 1996-1997 RXTE standard2 observations of 4U 1820\u221230. They obtained\nan orbital period of Porb = 685.0144 \u00b1 0.0054 s.\nThey then did a phase analysis combining the\nRXTE 1996-1997 observations of 4U 1820\u221230\nwith pre-XTE data and found an orbital period\nof Porb =685.0119 \u00b1 0.0001 s. The uncertainties\nin both figures are small enough (see Section 4.2)\nthat we did not need to search over this parameter. The decay in Porb due to emission of gravita6\n\n\fwas repeated for the next set of trial orbital parameters.\n3.3.3.\n\nwith our phase modulation search technique and\nour orbital-parameter-fitting coherent search technique.\n\nCandidate Follow-up\n4.1.\n\nEach candidate returned by the orbital-parameterfitting code included a pulsation frequency f , an\norbital amplitude x, an orbital phase \u03c6, and a\nsignificance \u03c3. Using the returned values for f , x,\nand \u03c6, we folded all the candidates with \u03c3 > 5,\nallowing the folding program to search a small distance in the frequency space. Most of the folded\ncandidates showed noise-like profiles. None of the\ncandidates corresponding to the more promisinglooking folds appeared in more that one observation except for one candidate. This candidate\nappeared in two observations. However, the fold\nof the second detection of this candidate showed\na noise-like profile.\nSince folding the statistically significant candidates did not return any interesting results, we\nlooked for candidates that repeated in more than\none observation (to within a fractional range of\nfpercent = 0.001% and to within a difference in x of\nxdifference = (Porb \u2217 fpercent)/(400\u03c0 + 2\u03c0fpercent) lts). fpercent and xdifference were derived taking into\naccount the spacing between the trial values of x\nand the drop in the amplitude of the detected signal when the trial orbital parameters were slightly\noff. There were about 300 candidates that repeated in 2 observations, and 0 candidates that repeated in more than 2 observations. We grouped\nthe 300 candidates into pairs. Assuming the orbital period of 685.0119 \u00b1 0.0001 s reported in\nChou & Grindlay (2001), we checked if the orbits\nof the members of each pair were in phase with\neach other. In 18 of the pairs the two orbits were\nin phase. In all 18 cases the single trial significances of the members of the pairs were around\n3 \u03c3. Again, the folds of all 36 candidates showed\nnoise-like profiles.\n4.\n\nPhase Modulation Searches\n\nThe phase modulation searches that we ran\non observation-long data sets were more sensitive\nthan the searches that we ran on the orbit-long\ndata sets (Ransom et al. 2003). In this section we\npresent the procedure used to set an upper limit on\nthe pulsed fraction using the more sensitive search.\nFirst, to save computer time, we wrote a modified version of our search script that searched only\na particular region of the FFT. We then ran this\nversion of the search on several data sets containing simulated pulsations from 4U 1820\u221230 of\nvarious pulsed fractions, for a range of companion masses (0.02 M\u2299 \u2264 Mc \u2264 0.3 M\u2299 ), and for\nseveral spin frequencies. For the purpose of the\nsimulations, we assumed the known orbital period of 685 s, a typical RXTE observation duration\n(20.5 ks), a count rate of 2050 counts per second,\nan inclination angle of 60\u25e6 , and a circular orbit.\nFigure 3 shows the results of the simulations for\nthis type of search run on data sets containing fake\n3 ms sinusoidal pulsations. Every point in the figure corresponds to 100 searched data sets. The\nshading of every point corresponds to the detected\npower of the signal. The power was then converted\nto probability and multiplied by the number of independent trials (roughly the original number of\ntime bins) to convert it to \u03c3. In Figure 3, the line\nof \u03c3 = 5 indicates the value of our 95% confidence\nupper limit on the pulsed fraction for a signal period of 3 ms. This value varied between 0.55% and\n1.0% (background unsubtracted) over the range\nof companion masses that we used. The value\nwas unaffected by the background correction since\nthe background was small compared to the source\ncount rate: using the 'FTOOL' PCABACKEST, we\nestimated the background count to be 10 counts\nper second per PCU. This is only 2% of the typical count rate of the source. This means that\nif there were a 3-ms coherent pulsation coming\nfrom 4U 1820\u221230 with a pulsed fraction equal to\nor higher than the upper limit stated above, our\nsearches would have detected it at \u03c3 \u2265 5 95% of\nthe time. The upper limit on the pulsed fraction\ndecreased slightly when the period of the signal\nwas larger by a few milliseconds. This is because,\n\nResults and Upper Limits\n\nOur searches did not detect pulsations.\nSince we ran the acceleration searches in a region where they are not optimized, they were\nmuch less sensitive than the other two searches\nthat we used. Below we explain the procedure\nwe used to set an upper limit on the pulsed fraction of pulsations from 4U 1820\u221230 detectable\n7\n\n\f\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\nRe Xorb e2\u03c0it/Porb \u2212 Re Xtrial e2\u03c0it/Porb ))\n\nat longer spin periods, the width of the sidebands\nfeature is smaller (see Section 3.2.1); and hence\nthe power accumulated in each of the sidebands is\ngreater. For example, for a 10-ms coherent pulsation, this value varied between 0.3% and 0.5%\nover the range of companion masses that we used.\nSimilarly, the upper limit on the pulsed fraction\nincreases for smaller spin frequencies.\nOur upper limit on the pulsed fraction of possible signals from 4U 1820\u221230 is \u223c0.8% for spin\nperiods close to 3 ms. The pulsed fractions of the\nsignals detected from the 5 LMXBs with known\nsignal period ranged between 3% and 7%, for signal frequencies between 2 and 6 ms (Wijnands &\nvan der Klis 1998; Markwardt et al. 2002; Galloway et al. 2002; Markwardt et al. 2003a; Campana et al. 2003).\n4.2.\n\n=\n\nIn other words, the effect will be exactly that of a\nresidual phase modulation of complex amplitude\nXorb \u2212 Xtrial .\nSuch a phase modulation produces a comblike pattern in the Fourier domain (see Figure 2).\nFor narrow combs, the tallest peak is the central peak: the one at the true pulsation frequency. The amplitude of the central peak falls\noff as J0 (|Xorb \u2212 Xtrial | 2\u03c0f ) where J0 is a 0th\norder Bessel function (Ransom et al. 2003; Middleditch 2004). Therefore, the sensitivity loss (in\npower) due to a residual phase modulation of size\n|Xorb \u2212 Xtrial | = \u03b5 will be J0 (\u03b52\u03c0f )2 . This means\nthat if we search the Xorb space with a sufficient\ndensity to fall within \u03b5 of every plausible Xorb ,\nwe will detect the source with a sensitivity only a\nfactor of J0 (\u03b52\u03c0f )2 less than that we would have\nfor an isolated pulsar. In other words, the residual time shifts need to be small compared to the\npulsation period.\nFor this particular situation, we fixed the maximum |X| as 0.032 lt-ms, fmax as 1250 Hz, and the\nsensitivity factor as 0.5 at fmax . The maximum\nallowable residual X (which we called \u03b5) is then\n0.000143 ms. With that in mind, we generated\nan optimal grid of trials for complex-valued X. It\nturns out that the optimal grid (the one where the\nparameter space is searched most efficiently) is a\na circle-packing array: a grid where the values of\nXtrial are distributed on the corners of equilateral\ntriangles (e.g., Middleditch 2004). The point in\nthe middle of every triangle is the point that is furthest away from the closest Xtrial and therefore the\ndistance between it and the closest Xtrial should\nbe \u03b5 = 0.000143 lt-s. The spacing between any\ntwo guesses is then 0.000264 lt-s. The total number of trials of X is then the area of the complex\nX-plane containing the trials (roughly \u03c0xmax 2 ) divided by the area covered by every Xtrial (roughly\n\u03c0\u03b52 ). This amounts to an approximate number\nof 50000 trials per observation. With the trials\nof X distributed as we described, our worst case\nsensitivity to a given signal of frequency f is then\nJ0 (0.000143 \u00d7 2\u03c0f )2 \u00d7 (the sensitivity to an isolated pulsar signal of frequency f ). At f = fmax\n\nOrbital-Parameter-Fitting Coherent\nSearches\n\nThe goal of orbital-parameter-fitting is to\nachieve a sensitivity close to the sensitivity one\nwould have if the pulsar were isolated. To achieve\nthis, one must compute how densely to sample\nthe three-dimensional space of orbital parameters. Such calculations have already been done by\nMiddleditch (2004), but in this section we work\nthrough them with more details to better understand the effects of small errors in the trial orbital\nperiod.\nFirst, assume that Porb is known exactly. Then\ncombine x and \u03c6 into a single complex number X\nX = xei\u03c6 .\nIf the pulsar emits sinusoidal pulsations at a frequency f , then the received signal will be\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\ns(t) = sin(2\u03c0f t + Re Xorb e2\u03c0it/Porb ),\nup to a phase shift (which we will ignore). If the\npulse profile is not sinusoidal, this transformation\nwill happen equally to all harmonics; we will ignore this too.\nSuppose that we remove the effects of the orbital motion by time-shifting the incoming events\naccording to a model using the known Porb but\nX = Xtrial . The observed signal will then be\ns(t) =\n\nsin(2\u03c0f (t +\n\u0011\n\u0010\nRe (Xorb \u2212 Xtrial )e2\u03c0it/Porb )).\n\nsin(2\u03c0f (t +\n8\n\n\fthe value of this factor is 0.5. Its value increases\nfor signals of lower frequency. For f = fmax /2, it\nis 0.85.\nIn the above calculation, we assumed no loss of\npower due to errors in the assumed orbital period.\nBut how accurately does Porb need to be known?\nWe can do an approximate calculation: suppose\nthat Ptrial = (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Porb . The resulting signal is\nthen\ns(t) =\n\n\u2243\n\nsin(2\u03c0f (t +\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nRe Xorb e2\u03c0it/Porb \u2212 Re Xtrial e2\u03c0it/Ptrial ))\nsin(2\u03c0f (t +\n\u0011\n\u0010\nRe (Xorb \u2212 Xtrial e2\u03c0it\u01eb/Porb )e2\u03c0it/Porb )).\n\nThis amounts to an additional slowly-varying error in the estimation of the orbital phase \u03c6. Errors\nin \u03c6 that are independent of (Porb \u2212Ptrial ) have already been taken into account by the earlier sensitivity calculations. Therefore, when we calculated\nthe effects of the additional slowly-varying error in\n\u03c6 in a given observation of length Tobs , we could\nassume, to start with, that \u03c6 is correct in the middle of that observation. At the end of that observation, we would have accumulated an error of size\n\u01eb\u03c0Tobs /Porb in the estimation of \u03c6. This adds an\nadditional residual X of about \u01eb |X| \u03c0Tobs /Porb .\nIn the worst case, this is about 4.3\u01eb lt-s. From the\ndifference between the value we used for the orbital\nperiod (685.014 s) and the lower bound on the\nmore accurate orbital period measured in Chou &\nGrindlay (2001) of 685.0119\u00b10.0001 s, we estimate\n\u01eb \u223c 0.000003. Hence the size of the maximum additional residual X is \u223c 0.000013 lt-s, which is a\nfactor of \u223c11 smaller than the maximum residual\nX that the spacing in our grid of trials is allowing. In the worst case scenario (at f = fmax and\nx = xmax ), if we combine the maximum error in X\ndue to the spacing of our trials with the additional\nerror in X due to the error in the orbital period,\nwe find a worst case sensitivity of 0.43 \u00d7 that for\nan isolated pulsar (instead of 0.5 when the Porb is\nexactly right). If the error caused by the uncertainty in Porb were slightly larger, it would have\ncaused an even larger decrease in the detectable\npower, and we would have been forced to search\nin Porb also.\nAbove, we have extracted formulae for the sensitivity of the orbital-parameter-fitting search in\n\nterms of the sensitivity of searches for an isolated\npulsar. These, as well as a small number of simulations, show the following: if there are no errors in\nthe search parameters, we can detect at 3 \u03c3 a signal of pulsed fraction 0.17%, and at 5.3 \u03c3 a signal\nof pulsed fraction 0.2%. If our trials for the orbital\nparameters (including the orbital period) are off\nby the worst-case amounts, we can detect at 3 \u03c3 a\nsignal of pulsed fraction 0.26%, and at 5.3 \u03c3 a signal of pulsed fraction 0.3%. The above numbers\nare summarized in Table 3. Because of the way\nwe are doing the candidate follow-up (i.e. folding\ncandidates that appear several times in the list of\ncandidates), the occurrence of the signal in more\nthan one observation increases greatly the chance\nof detecting it: if a signal appeared only in one\nobservation at 3 \u03c3, we would have discarded it as\na false candidate. If a signal appeared in several\nobservations at 3 \u03c3 we would certainly not have\nmissed it. Finally, any individual signal that appeared at \u03c3 \u2265 5.3 would have been detected with\nconfidence.\nTo summarize, our sensitivity formulae and our\nsimulations show reliable detection at a pulse fraction of 0.3% for the parameters we have chosen.\nThis is of course dependent on a number of assumptions: the companion must be a degenerate\nstar, the pulsation frequency must be less than\nabout 1250 Hz, and Porb must be within 0.0022 ms\nof 685.014 ms. It should be noted, however, that\nthese assumptions are covariant: if the pulsation\nfrequency is lower, the sensitivity improves. If x\nis smaller than the assumed upper bound, we become less sensitive to an error in Ptrial .\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe search described in this paper represents\nthe first source in a larger program to search for coherent pulsations in the persistent LMXBs. There\nare currently five known accreting MSPs, all of\nwhich have pulse frequencies in the range of 185\nto 435 Hz and low luminosities. The pulsed fractions observed are in the 3 \u2013 7 % range. Recently,\nobservations of burst oscillations, kHz QPOs, and\ncoherent pulsations in two of these accreting MSPs\nhave confirmed that the burst oscillations are indeed at the spin frequency (Chakrabarty et al.\n2003; Markwardt, Strohmayer, & Swank 2003b)\nand that the kHz QPO separation can be ei-\n\n9\n\n\fther near the spin frequency or half the spin frequency. Thus, there is now a total sample of\n14 LMXBs with well-determined spin frequencies. In 5 LMXBs, coherent pulsations are observed (Wijnands & van der Klis 1998; Markwardt\net al. 2002; Galloway et al. 2002; Markwardt et al.\n2003a; Markwardt & Swank 2003). In 11 LMXBs\nburst oscillations are observed (Strohmayer 2001;\nStrohmayer et al. 2003). In 2 of these LMXBs,\nboth coherent pulsations and burst oscillations are\nobserved (Chakrabarty et al. 2003; Strohmayer\net al. 2003).\nWe can see pulsations during X-ray bursts and\nin the non-burst emission in a handful of transient\nsources. Why then can we not see pulsations in\nthe persistent emission of the many bright LMXBs\nincluding 4U 1820\u221230?\nFor any individual pulsar, an unfavorable viewing geometry or rotational geometry can prevent\nthe pulsations from being seen. However, a systematic absence of pulsations from all persistent\nLMXBs would require a stronger explanation.\nThere are three main categories of explanations\nthat have been considered. These are: relativistic\neffects that decrease the observed pulsed fraction,\nsmearing of pulses from the surface due to electron scattering, and surface magnetic fields that\nare too weak to significantly channel the accretion\nflow (possibly as a result of magnetic screening).\nWe briefly consider each of the possibilities below.\nIn Wood, Ftaclas, & Kearney (1988), the\nauthors demonstrate that gravitational lightbending effects on emission from hot polar caps\ncan greatly reduce the pulsed fraction: the pulses\nare distorted and the pulsed fraction decreases as\na star becomes more relativistic because its radius\nis decreasing. The decrease in the pulsed fraction results from the fact that the gravitational\ndeflection of photons displaces the horizon away\nfrom the observer. In other words, more of the\nstar than a hemisphere is visible to the observer.\nThus, one of the caps is always in nearly full view\nas the other is disappearing. It is possible for the\npulsed fraction of a given source to be reduced\ndown to \u223c1%, provided the radius of the emitting star is small enough and the opening angle\nof the polar caps is large enough (Meszaros, Riffert, & Berthiaume 1988). This fraction is larger\nthan our upper limit on the pulsed fraction, suggesting that gravitational lensing effects may not\n\nbe the only factor preventing us from seeing the\npulsations. Also, the five known accreting MSPs\nexhibit pulsed fractions of more than 5%. There\nis no reason to believe that those systems have a\nsignificantly different value of M/R than the persistent LMXBs. Consequently, it seems that the\nrelativistic effects are not the primary explanation\nfor the small pulsed fraction in the latter sources.\nAnother explanation for low modulation fractions, electron scattering, has been revisited by\nTitarchuk, Cui, & Wood (2002). The existence\nof a corona (a spherical cloud) of hot electrons\nsurrounding the accreting star has been inferred\nfrom the analysis of the X-ray spectra of several\nLMXBs (e.g., Kylafis & Klimis 1987; Titarchuk\net al. 2002). This hot corona is presumably upscattering softer seed photons and smearing out\nthe pulsations. Titarchuk et al. (2002) argue that\nit is because of the large optical depth of this\ncorona that pulsations have not been detected\nfrom most LMXBs. They claim that the optical depth below which millisecond pulsations become detectable is \u03c4 \u223c 4. They also do spectral\nfits for several LMXBs and extract the parameter \u03c4 . For the majority of the analysed LMXBs\nthey find that the optical depth of the Compton\ncloud is at least twice as high as \u03c4 = 4. For these\nLMXBs, they claim that any high frequency pulsations (higher than \u223c300 Hz) would be below detectability. Titarchuk et al. also make the observation that there is a possibility of finding pulsations in the sources that are much less luminous,\nbecause in these sources, the spherical Compton\ncloud is more transparent (\u03c4 < 4). Unfortunately,\nthe smallest reported \u03c4 for the spherical Compton\ncloud that is presumably surrounding 4U 1820\u221230\nwas \u03c4 = 6 (Bloser et al. 2000). In all the other\npapers that discuss spectra from 4U 1820\u221230, the\nauthors used a Comptonization model with a black\nbody component to fit the spectra and found that\n\u03c4 falls between 11 and 13 (e.g., White, Stella, &\nParmar 1988). If what Titarchuk et al. (2002)\nhave claimed is true, the large optical depth of the\nComptonizing cloud could very well be the reason\nwe are not seeing pulsations from 4U 1820\u221230.\nThe possibility of magnetic screening by accreted material at high accretion rates has been\nexamined by Cumming, Zweibel, & Bildsten\n(2001). Their reasoning goes as follows: to get\npreferential heating of the stellar surface, the mag10\n\n\fnetic field must be large enough to disrupt the\naccretion flow and channel it onto the polar caps.\nPreferential heating of the surface causes the observed emission to be pulsed. If the accretion flow\nis not disrupted by a magnetosphere, the accretion disk is believed to extend almost to the stellar\nsurface and pulsations are no longer seen. This\ncould happen because the external dipole magnetic field of the star is 'buried' or 'screened' by\nthe accreted matter. Cumming et al. (2001) study\nthe 'burial' scenario. In particular, they study\nthe competition between downward compression\nof the magnetic flux by accretion at a given \u1e40 ,\nand its upward transport by diffusion. They find\nthat the diffusion and accretion time scales are\nequal for \u1e40 \u223c 0.1\u1e40Edd, where \u1e40Edd is the accretion rate given by the Eddington limit. This\nmeans that for larger \u1e40 there is little chance that\nmagnetic flux makes it to the surface and therefore little chance of observing pulsations. They\nalso find that magnetic screening is completely\nineffective for \u1e40 < 0.02\u1e40Edd, so that, no matter how the accreted material joins onto the star,\nthe underlying stellar field would always be evident. The typical range of mass accretion rates in\nLMXBs is \u1e40 \u2265 0.01\u1e40Edd (\u1e40 \u2265 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\n(Chakrabarty et al. 2003). Cumming et al. (2001)\npropose that the absence of persistent millisecond\npulsations from most neutron stars in LMXBs\nis due to their high accretion rates. Discoveries\nmade since then are consistent with their hypothesis: all five persistent millisecond X-ray pulsars\nare low-luminosity transients in very close binaries\nthat lie at the low end of the mean \u1e40 distribution\nfor LMXBs with \u1e40 \u223c 10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Galloway\net al. 2002; Campana et al. 2003; Chakrabarty\net al. 2003). It is tempting to adopt magnetic\nscreening as the main explanation for the lack of\nobserved pulsations from 4U 1820\u221230 because the\nluminosity of this source (\u223c 4 \u00d7 1037 ergs/s) is on\nthe high end of luminosities of atoll sources, implying a normal (rather than a low) accretion rate of\nthe in-falling matter. Stella et al. (1987) estimated\nthis accretion rate to be \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n6.\n\nThese limits were between 0.3% and 0.8% over this\nwhole range. We also searched a broad range of\nluminosity and spectral states (see Figure 1). The\nluminosities covered the range from 0.08 to 0.25\nof the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star and a distance of 6.4 kpc. 4U1820\u221230 is\ninteresting in this regard because the luminosity\nvaries by a factor of three.\nFor 4U 1820\u221230, our upper limits are about an\norder of magnitude lower in pulsed fraction than\nthe known accreting MSPs. However, this is only\none source and any number of specific features,\nsuch as unfavorable viewing or rotational geometries, in addition to electron scattering and magnetic screening, could prevent the pulsations from\nbeing seen. The most interesting conclusions will\nbe drawn once we have a sample of many more\nsources that have been searched to similarly deep\nlevels.\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)\nJulie Payette research scholarship.
