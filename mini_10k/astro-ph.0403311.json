The\nstudy is based on a sample of 30 sources distributed along the IRAS colour-colour diagram. The sources were\nchosen to trace the Miras with thick shells and the whole range of OH/IR stars. The Miras exhibit a 1665 MHz\nemission strength comparable to that at 1667 MHz. Even though the Miras of the study have quite thick shells,\ntheir spectral characteristics in both main lines attest to a strong heterogeneity in their OH shell with, in particular,\nthe presence of significant turbulence and acceleration. The expansion velocity has been found to be about the\nsame at 1665 and 1667 MHz, taking into account a possible velocity turbulence of 1-2 km s\u22121 at the location of\nthe main-line maser emission. An increase in the intensity ratio 1667/1665 with shell thickness has been found. A\nplausible explanation for such a phenomenon is that competitive gain in favour of the 1667 MHz line increases when\nthe shell is getting thicker. There is an evolution in the spectral profile shape with the appearance of a substantial\ninter-peak signal when the shell is getting thicker. Also, inter-peak components are found and can be as strong as\nthe external standard peaks when the shell is very thick. This trend for an increase of the signal in between the\ntwo main peaks is thought to be the result of an increase of the saturation with shell thickness. All sources but\ntwo - a Mira and an OH/IR star from the lower part of the colour\u2212colour diagram - are weakly polarized. The\nstrong polarization observed for those two particular objects is thought to be the result of perturbations in their\nshells.\nKey words. Stars: AGB and post-AGB \u2212 circumstellar matter \u2212 Masers \u2212 Line: profiles \u2212 Stars: mass-loss \u2212\nStars: evolution\n\n1. Introduction\nThe standard model proposed by Reid et al. (1977)\nexplains convincingly the double-peaked profile usually\nobserved for Miras and OH/IR objects, particularly at\n1612 MHz. It also explains the general features of the\ncircumstellar envelopes. Nevertheless, many stars do not\nhave such a simple OH maser profile. In particular, in the\nmain lines, the peaks are often broad and consist of many\ncomponents. To explain these more complex profiles new\nmodels have been suggested.\nAlcock & Ross (1986) have shown that it is possible\nto change the profile shape for a partially or fully saturated maser when the masering region becomes sufficiently\nthick. When that happens, the profiles consist of broader\npeaks and a signal is seen at the velocity of the star. This is\nin agreement with the spectral profiles observed for Miras\nand OH/IR objects, but the inferred internal and external\nradii disagree with the MERLIN and VLA interferometric\nobservations. To overcome this discrepancy, Alcock & Ross\nSend offprint requests to: S. Etoka\nCorrespondence to: setoka@jb.man.ac.uk\n\nsuggest that the mass loss is not a continuous and uniform\nprocess but rather consists of ejection of blobs of material\nin random directions such that the symmetrical geometry\nis preserved. The model calculation results of Collison &\nNedoluha (1995) agree with the conclusions by Alcock &\nRoss that the observed OH profile cannot be produced by\nthe standard model description of a smooth, spherically\nsymmetric, steady windlike mass loss. The assumption of\na non-smooth shell is justified by the interferometric maps\nthemself. Indeed, with the increase in interferometer resolution the more detailed maps revealed that the OH maser\nemission is located in clumps (Welty, Fix & Mutel, 1987;\nChapman, Cohen & Saikia, 1991) and/or the shell shows\nevidence for deviation from spherical symmetry (Diamond\net al. 1985; Bowers, Johnston & de Vegt 1989).\nEvidence for acceleration in the OH shell has been\nfound for many stars (Chapman et al. 1994; Etoka &\nLe Squeren 1996, 1997; Szymczak et al. 1998; Richards\net al. 1999). The importance of acceleration in the shape of\nthe spectral profile is underlined by the work of Chapman\n& Cohen (1985). According to the value of the logarithmic\nvelocity gradient \u01eb, the shape of the observed line profile\n\n\f2\n\nS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\nlargely varies as follows : (1) for \u01eb \u2192 0 the classical doublepeaked profile is observed; (2) for 0 < \u01eb < 1 an inter-peak\nsignal can be seen; (3) for \u01eb \u2243 1 a plateau-shaped profile is\nobtained and finally (4) for \u01eb > 1 the profile is reduced to\na single peak centred on the stellar velocity. Thus, many\nspectral profiles resembling those observed can be modelled by introducing acceleration in the OH shell.\nBased on the IRAS measurements at 12, 25 and 60 \u03bcm,\nOlnon et al. (1984) discovered the existence of a continuous sequence from Miras to OH/IR objects in the socalled colour-colour diagram which plots the colour indices\n[60 \u2212 25] vs. [12 \u2212 25]. This sequence has been analysed in\nterms of shell thickness by van der Veen & Habing (1988)\nand van der Veen & Rugers (1989). These studies lead to a\ncommonly accepted interpretation that it is an evolutionary track followed by intermediate-mass stars. In this scenario, Miras are the progenitors of OH/IR stars involving\namong other characteristics an increase of their mass-loss\nrate and expansion velocity with time. Nonetheless, the\ninitial mass of the star could play a role in the setting up\nof that sequence. Based on an alternative model for the\nevolution of AGB stars proposed by Epchtein et al. (1990),\nL\u00e9pine et al. (1995) proposed that the IRAS colour-colour\nsequence could be a sequence of mass.\nThe study presented here deals with the spectral profiles in both main lines of Miras and OH/IR stars distributed along the colour-colour diagram. The main aim\nis to determine whether there is a relation between the\nspectral profile and the thickness of the circumstellar shell.\nThe next section presents the observations and selection\ncriteria. Section 3 and Appendices A, B and C present the\nresults concerning the individual stars and a comparison\nwith previous observations. The discussion is presented in\nSect. 4 and the final conclusions in Sect. 5.\n\nof circumstellar shell evolution. Figure 1 shows the colourcolour diagram of the selected sources. The colour indices\n[25\u221212] and [60\u221225] used here were calculated according\nto the following relation :\n[\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 ] = log(\n\n\u03bd1 S\u03bd (\u03bb1 )\n)\n\u03bd2 S\u03bd (\u03bb2 )\n\n(1)\n\nsimilar to that used by Sivagnanam et al. (1990).\n\nFig. 1. [60-25] vs. [25-12] colour-colour diagram of the sources\nof the study\n\nThe selected objects were intended to cover the far\nright-hand side of the region labelled \"Mira-like\" by\nSivagnanam et al. (1990) and the areas labelled LSDD\nand R2 by David et al. (1993a) for the OH/IR sources.\nThese areas are respectively delimited as follows :\n\n2. Observations\nThe OH observations were carried out between March\nand December 1994 with the Nan\u00e7ay transit radiotelescope. The half-power beamwidth of the radiotelescope\nat 1.6 GHz is 3.5\u2032 in \u03b1 by 19\u2032 in \u03b4. The system temperature was about 50 K. A frequency switching mode was\nused. The autocorrelator was divided into 4 banks of 256\nchannels each, allowing simultaneous observations of the\ntwo OH main lines (i.e., 1665 and 1667 MHz) in both leftand right-handed circular polarizations (LHC, RHC). A\nbandwidth of 1.56 MHz was used, leading to a velocity\nresolution of 0.56 km s\u22121 . The ratio of flux to antenna\ntemperature was 1.1 Jy K\u22121 at 0o declination. Each observation lasted about one hour providing a mean rms of\n0.035 K. All the radial velocities given hereafter are relative to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR).\n\n2.1. Selection criteria\nAll the sources presented here had already been positively\ndetected at 1667 MHz and a few of them at 1665 MHz too.\nWe looked for 1665 MHz emission for a possible signature\n\n\u2212 0.50 < [25 \u2212 12] < \u22120.40\n\u22121.30 < [60 \u2212 25] < \u22120.80\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212 0.40 < [25 \u2212 12] < +0.00\n\u22121.20 < [60 \u2212 25] < \u22120.80\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\u2212 0.10 < [25 \u2212 12] < +0.40\n\u22120.80 < [60 \u2212 25] < \u22120.20\n\n(4)\n\nThese areas are covered by the regions labelled IIIa\n(i.e., variable stars with more evolved O-rich circumstellar\nshells), IIIb (i.e.,variable stars with thick O-rich circumstellar shells) and IV (i.e., variable stars with very thick\nO-rich circumstellar shells) by van der Veen & Habing\n(1988) and van der Veen & Rugers (1989).\nThe observations by David et al. (1993a) were done\nat 1612 and 1667 MHz, and those of Sivagnanam et al.\n(1990) at 1667 MHz only. Both sets of observations were\n\n\fS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\ncarried out with the Nan\u00e7ay radiotelescope with the same\nresolution as the present work, allowing a direct comparison of the profile shapes. Observations made by David\net al. (1993a) for the stars of interest were taken over a\nperiod of 5.5 years from mid-1986 to the early 1992. Those\nof Sivagnanam et al. (1990) were all obtained in July 1986\nexcept that of IRAS 20547+0247 which was obtained in\nMay 1987.\n\n3. Results: General comments\nTable 1 presents the main characteristics of the sources of\nthe study. Columns 1 to 10 give the name of the source,\nits galactic coordinates, its LRS class, its IRAS flux at 12,\n25 and 60 \u03bcm, its [25 \u2212 12] and [60 \u2212 25] colour indices\nand finally the name under which it is also known. The\ntable was divided such that the three parts correspond to\nthe three regions \"Mira-like\", LSDD and R2 defined by\nthe colour indices given in (2), (3) and (4) respectively.\nThe results concerning the spectral profile changes of\nthe individual sources in the three regions of concern are\npresented in Appendix A.\nFigure B.1 presents the spectral profiles of each\nsource at 1665 and 1667 MHz in both circular polarizations. As IRAS 18198\u22121249, IRAS 18257\u22121000,\nIRAS 18488\u22120107, IRAS 19065+0832, IRAS 22177+5936\nand IRAS 19075+0921 had already been detected before\nthe work of David et al. (1993a), their spectra were not\ndisplayed by the previously cited authors. The spectral\nprofiles of the 5 first cited sources are given in Dickinson\n& Turner (1991) and that of IRAS 19075+0921 is given\nin Le Squeren et al. (1992). Therefore, for these 6 sources,\nthe spectral shape changes were determined from the\ncomparison of our observations with those of the two\npapers mentioned, while for the other sources, comparison\nhas been made with those of David et al. for the OH/IR\nstars and Sivagnanam et al. (1990) for the Miras. All the\nsources of the R2 region were also observed at 1612 MHz\nby David et al. (1993b) and quite a few by te Lintel et al.\n(1991). Three, out of the six sources of the LSDD region\nwere observed at 1612 MHz by te Lintel et al. (1991).\nFinally, all the sources of the \"Mira-like\" region were observed at 1667 and 1612 MHz by Sivagnanam et al. (1990).\nTables C.1 and C.2 present the results of the spectral\nmeasurements done at 1665 and 1667 MHz respectively.\nAs for Table 1, these tables were divided into three parts\ncorresponding to the three regions of concern. Columns\n1 to 16 give the name of the source, a comment about\nits profile shape in the case of a non \"standard\" doublepeaked profile, the velocity of the blue- and red-shifted\npeaks and the velocity of any inter-peak component in\nboth circular polarizations, the stellar and expansion\nvelocities inferred, the flux intensity of the blue- and\nred-shifted peak and that of any inter-peak component\nin both circular polarizations (i.e., measured respectively\n\n3\n\nat the velocity given in column 3 to 8) respectively.\nFor the profile shape we distinguish between 4 different\ncategories : \"standard\" type spectrum but exhibiting\ninter-peak signal (\"s\"), plateau profile spectrum (\"p\"),\nspectrum with more than two well detached peaks (i.e.,\n\"standard\" profile plus an internal feature, \"ci\" where\n\"internal\" means in between the two standard peaks)\nand finally spectrum showing only a single peak centred\nat or about the stellar velocity (\"c\"). For the two last\ncategories, the characteristics of the signal are given in\ncolumns 7, 8 and 15, 16.\nDavid et al. (1993a) used the 1985 IRAS fluxes while\nwe used the corrected 1987 fluxes. Thus, IRAS 18460-0254\nwhich was initially in the R2 region of David et al. is now\noutside this box due to a notable difference in its [60 \u2212 25]\ncolour index when calculated with or without correction\n(cf. Fig. 1). Nevertheless, its [25\u221212] colour index is hardly\naffected by the application of the IRAS correction. Since\nthis index is the most relevant in terms of mass loss and\nshell thickness dependence, we decided to incorporate this\nsource in the statistics of the R2 region.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. The \"Mira-like\" sample\nThe area corresponding to the OH-emitter Miras contains five objects which, according to their location in the\ncolour-colour diagram, have the thickest shells of their category. None of the five sources exhibits a standard spectral\nprofile either at 1665 or 1667 MHz and only one source\nshows a double-peaked profile characterized by two unevenly broad and spiky peaks. This source has the smallest\n[25\u221212] colour index value of the sample. All the sources\nshow quite irregular spectral profile shapes. This tendency\nis also clearly observable in the spectral profiles obtained\nby Sivagnanam et al. (1990, their Fig. 2). Such a strong departure from the double-peaked spectral profile indicates\na strong heterogeneity in the physical and dynamical conditions ruling over the whole OH shell even though those\nMiras have quite thick shells.\nAll the sources show OH variability. Among the five\nsources selected, four of them were primarily successfully\ndetected in the satellite line at 1612 MHz and we detected 1665 MHz emission from all of them. For most\nof the sources of the \"Mira-like\" sample positively detected by Sivagnanam et al. (1990) as OH-emitters, when\n1612 MHz emission was detected its intensity was comparable to or greater than that at 1667 MHz. Such a trend\nin the strengthening of the 1612 MHz emission over that\nof the main lines is expected when the shell is getting\nthick enough (cf. Lewis 1989; David et al. 1993b; Habing\n1996). The sample selected here (i.e., \u22120.50 <[25\u221212]<\n\u22120.40) is such that it fulfils the physical conditions for\nthe 1612 MHz and the main-line emissions to be of similar strength. IRAS 15226\u22123603 was one of the rare sources\nnot detected positively at 1667 MHz, nor did we detect any\n\n\f4\n\nS. Etoka and A.M.

Since this source was detected\npositively by Sivagnanam et al. earlier, our non-detection\nis most likely due to the fact that the source was at its\nOH minimum at the time of our observations. Finally, one\nsource (IRAS 22525+6033) appeared to be strongly polarized in both main lines. This source exhibits the strongest\n1665 MHz emission and the greatest expansion velocity of\nits group: about 10 km s\u22121 . Thus, this source is located in\nthe narrow zone where both Miras and OH/IR stars can\nbe found in the \"period\u2212OH expansion velocity\" diagram\nas given by Sivagnanam et al. (1989).\n\n4.2. The OH/IR sample of the LSDD region\nThis sample of six sources presents the highest rate of\ndouble-peaked spectral profiles at 1667 MHz (>50%)\nwith very faint or non-existent inter-peak emission.\nFour of the six sources (i.e., 67%) were detected at\n1665 MHz at the time of the observations. Nevertheless,\nnone of the sources shows a \"classical\" double-peaked\nprofile at that frequency. In addition, the 1665 MHz\nemission for the sources of this sample is very faint.\nOnly IRAS 19075+0921 shows a significant flux density\nat 1665 MHz (i.e., comparable to that observed at\n1667 MHz). This particular source also shows strong\npolarization in both main lines and has the smallest\nexpansion velocity of the whole sample, with a value\nof 7.7 km s\u22121 . Consequently, like IRAS 22525+6033,\nIRAS 19075+0921 is located in the zone where Miras\nand OH/IR stars coexist in the \"period\u2212OH expansion\nvelocity\" diagram of Sivagnanam et al.

The OH/IR sample of the R2 region\nThe R2 sample is composed of nineteen OH/IR stars. 84%\nof the stars of this group show at least two peaks in their\n1667 MHz spectral profile with only 31.5% showing a standard double-peaked profile (i.e., with no inter-peak signal). The percentage of stars having at least two peaks\nat 1665 MHz is only 48%. Five sources (i.e., 26%) exhibit\na single-peaked spectral profile and five other sources did\nnot show any 1665 MHz emission at all. 26% of the sources\nthat were positively detected at 1665 MHz show an internal group of components with an intensity comparable or\nsuperior to that of the red- or blue-shifted peaks.\nAmong the whole set of the double-peaked profiles of\nthis group of thicker OH/IR stars, nine sources (i.e., 48%)\nshow an inter-peak signal at 1667 MHz. Sun (1991) has\nmodelled the evolution of the 1612 MHz double-peaked\nprofile when the mass-loss rate varies with time. The author shows that the inter-peak signal at 1612 MHz increases with the mass-loss rate. Our results show that this\nproperty also applies to the 1667 MHz emission. Also, the\nexistence of an inter-peak signal is related to the degree of\nsaturation (Fix 1978). Therefore, the increased number of\ninter-peak signals observed in the profiles of these thicker\nOH/IR stars is quite probably a signature of greater maser\nsaturation at 1667 MHz.\n\n4.4. Spectral profile shape as a function of the shell\nthickness\nConsidering the three groups together, it stands out that\nthe spectral profiles with inter-peak signal as strong as\nthat of the red- or blue-shifted peaks are only observed\n\n\fS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\nfor OH/IR sources at 1665 MHz. OH/IR stars with\ninter-peak signal at 1667 MHz are found in both the\nLSDD and the R2 regions. Except IRAS 19352+2030\nwhich shows very faint blue- and red-shifted peaks and a\nvery strong inter-peak component in both main lines, the\nsources show a faint 1667 MHz inter-peak signal which\ncan be slightly polarized. Spectral profiles showing a welldetached inter-peak component at 1665 MHz arise from\nOH/IR stars belonging to the upper part of the R2 region,\nthat is, from the stars which have a very thick shell. The\n\"plateau\" profiles are only observed at 1665 MHz, but\nin all three groups. It can be particularly pronounced\nfor some objects (cf. IRAS 17411\u22123154). Such a profile\nshape generally attests to significant acceleration (i.e.,\nChapman & Cohen, 1985 for a velocity gradient \u01eb \u2243 1).\nThis confirms that the 1665 MHz emissive zone indeed\noriginates deeper inside the OH shell than the 1667 MHz\nzone.\n\nFigure 2 shows the correlation between the expansion\nvelocity inferred at 1665 MHz and that at 1667 MHz.\nThis diagram uses the measurements from all the sources\nthat showed at least two peaks in both main lines except\nIRAS 19244+1115 for which the expansion velocities\ninferred have to be taken with caution (cf. Appendix A.2).\nThe total number of such sources is 12, that is about\n41% of the whole sample of 29 objects for this statistic.\nThis corresponds respectively to 40, 40 and 42% of the\n\"Mira-like\", LSDD and R2 samples. The dotted line in\nthe figure is the locus for V1665 MHz =V1667 MHz . Most of\nthe sources have a similar expansion velocity in both main\nlines. At the location of the OH shell, some 1016 cm away\nfrom the central star, turbulence of 1-2 km s\u22121 is expected\n(Deguchi, 1982). This could result in the broadening of\nthe line wings and therefore explain most of the cases\nwhere 1665 MHz profiles overshoot those of the 1667 MHz\nline by such a value. One source, IRAS 17392\u22123319 from\nthe R2 region, shows an expansion velocity at 1665 MHz\ngreater by 4 km s\u22121 than that inferred at 1667 MHz. This\nmay be due to the faintness of the signal at 1665 MHz\nleading to a bigger uncertainty in the exact location of\nthe peak maxima.\n\nOnly four sources show an intensity at 1665 MHz\ngreater than that at 1667 MHz. These sources belong to\nthe \"Mira-like\" and LSDD regions. None of the sources of\nthe R2 region show this peculiarity. We have investigated\nwhether there was any correlation between the intensity\nobserved in the main lines and the thickness of the shell.\nTaking all the sources showing both 1665 and 1667 MHz\nemission, we have found that there is a relation between\nthe ratio of the intensity observed in the two main lines\nand the [25\u221212] colour index. This relation is shown Fig. 3,\nwhere the dotted line shows the linear regression over all\nthe sources except the three for which Intensity1667 >>\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Expansion velocity at 1667 MHz versus that at\n1665 MHz\nIntensity1665 (plotted with filled symbols). The linear regression is given by :\nInt(1667/1665)i = 6.54 \u00d7 [25 \u2212 12]i + 4.40\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Int(1667/1665)i is the ratio of the maximum intensity measured at 1667 and 1665 MHz for the source \"i\"\nand [25\u221212]i is its colour index.\nThree sources do not lie on the relation given by\nEq. (5). We do not think that this could be due to variability. Indeed, for one of the sources (IRAS 18432\u22120149)\nthe 1665 MHz emission faintness (\u223c 2\u03c3) could be responsible for the high Int(1667/1665) found but such an explanation is not plausible for the two other sources which\nshowed reasonably strong 1665 MHz emission at the time\nof the observations. On the other hand, it is noteworthy\nthat the three sources not following the general trend have\nsimilar [25\u221212] indices : [0;0.1].\nEquation (5) shows that when the shell becomes\nthicker, the 1667 MHz emission is favoured in comparison with that at 1665 MHz. Since the expansion velocity\nis about the same at 1665 and 1667 MHz it is expected\nthat the maser emission from both main lines should be\nfound at similar distances from the star and possibly share\nthe same regions of the OH shell. This hypothesis is supported by the maps of late-type stars obtained in VLBI\n(cf. Chapman et al. 1991, 1994; Szymczak et al. 1999).\nTherefore, a plausible explanation for such a trend is an\nincrease of competitive gain in favour of the 1667 MHz\nline when the shell becomes thicker.\nThis increase of the ratio of the 1667 MHz emission\nover that at 1665 MHz is in agreement with the fact that\n1667 MHZ emission becomes relatively stronger and eventually dominant in the post-AGB stage (Zijlstra et al.\n1989, 2001). The dominance of the 1667 MHz emission\nat this stage of the stellar evolution is supported by theoretical studies (Field 1985, Field & Gray 1988).\n\n\f6\n\nS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\nThis latter observational result is in agreement with\nearlier work by Baud (1981) who showed the existence of\na relation between the expansion velocity and the initial\nmass of the central star.\n\nFig. 3. (1667 MHz)/(1665 MHz) intensity ratio versus the\ncolour index [25-12]\n\n4.5. The Mira-OH/IR sequence\nThe Miras-OH/IR sequence seen in the IRAS colourcolour diagram results from the combination of various\nrelations existing amongst the physical parameters of the\ncentral star and the circumstellar envelopes : (1) between\nthe mass-loss rate and the period (Vassiliadis & Wood\n1993), (2) between the period and the expansion velocity (Dickinson & Chaison 1973, Le Squeren et al. 1979),\n(3) between the OH luminosity and the flux at 25 \u03bcm\n(Sivagnanam et al. 1989), (4) between the OH radius and\nthe OH luminosity (Baud & Habing 1983), (5) between\nthe size of the maser regions and the mass-loss rate (predicted for the H2 O masers by Cooke & Elitzur 1985 and\nobserved by Cohen 1987, Lane et al. 1987 and Yates &\nCohen 1994) and (6) between the mass-loss rate and the\noptical depth at 10 \u03bcm (Bedijn 1988). This can by summarized as follows : the increase of the pulsation period,\nthe expansion velocity, the radius of the circumstellar shell\nand the luminosity are all function of the mass-loss rate\nand the opacity of the shell.\nThe sequence observed in the colour-colour diagram\nmay be either evolutionary or related to the stellar\nmass. If it is an evolutionary sequence the star should\nexperience an increase of its mass-loss rate with time. If\nit is a mass sequence the mass loss should be connected\nsomehow to the initial mass. Volk & Kwok (1988) studied\nthe IR spectral evolution of AGB stars. Their study\nshows that AGB stars that have a silicate signature at\n10 \u03bcm in absorption are mainly stars with an initial mass\non the main sequence greater than 3 M\u2299 . This implies\nthat the shell thickness depends on the initial mass, since\nonly the stars massive enough will have a thick shell i.e.\nwill become OH/IR stars. Also, through a study of the\ngalactic distribution of OH/IR stars according to their\nexpansion velocity, Likkel (1989) found that the reddest\nOH/IR objects tend to have the highest initial masses.\n\nWe\nfound\nthat\nIRAS\n22525+6033\nand\nIRAS 19075\u22120921 belonging to the \"Mira-like\" group\nand to the LSDD group respectively show very similar\ncharacteristics : 1665 MHz flux comparable to that at\n1667 MHz, strong polarization over the whole velocity\nrange of the spectrum in both main lines, similar OH\nexpansion velocity values and [25\u221212] indices. This puts\nthese two objects in the location where Miras and OH/IR\nstars coexist both in the \"period-OH expansion velocity\"\ndiagram and the colour-colour diagram, but they have\na completely unusual set of spectral characteristics in\ncomparison with the rest of the stars with similar expansion velocities and IRAS [12-25] fluxes. In particular,\nthe very strong polarization observed over the whole\nspectral profile is clearly a sign of perturbation undergone\nthroughout the whole OH circumstellar shell, which we\ninterpret to be a signature that these objects are in the\ntransition phase Mira \u2192 OH/IR star. Indeed, similar\npolarization characteristics in the OH shell have been\nobserved (Bains et al. 2003, Etoka & Diamond 2004)\nattesting to the importance of the role played by the\nmagnetic field (in particular in the envelope shaping) in\nthe transitional stages of evolved stars. Bearing in mind\nthe existing relations between the initial mass and some\nof the actual physical properties of AGB stars such as\ntheir shell thickness or their expansion velocity, it is very\nlikely that the IRAS colour-colour sequence is related to\nboth the initial mass of the object and its evolutionary\nstage. A likely hypothesis is that the object arrives more\nor less high on the sequence and evolves through a part\nof it before expelling its shell entirely via an increasing\nmass loss.\n\n5. Conclusion\nAcceleration and turbulence can strongly alter the spectral profile shapes of circumstellar OH masers. This is well\nillustrated by the variety of spectral profiles observed for\nthe \"Mira-like\" sample. When the shell gets thicker and\nless turbulent, the standard double-peaked profile settles.\nAt that stage, saturation is the main cause of spectral profile alteration at 1667 MHz, causing an inter-peak signal\nto appear while plateau-shape or strong inter-peak components observed in the spectral profiles at 1665 MHz still\nattest to the presence of acceleration. Even though the\nspectral profile characteristics show that the 1665 MHz\nemission can be found deeper in the OH shell than the\n1667 MHz emission, the expansion velocity is found to be\nabout the same in both main lines, taking into account\na possible velocity turbulence of 1-2 km s\u22121 at the location of the main-line maser emission. It is then expected\nthat the maser emission from both main lines should be\nfound at similar distances from the star and possibly share\n\n\fS. Etoka and A.M.

This can be explained as an increase of competitive gain in favour of the 1667 MHz when the shell\nis becoming thicker. Finally, a Mira and an OH/IR star\nfrom the lower part of the colour\u2212colour diagram show\nquite strong polarization while the rest of the sources are\nweakly polarized. Strong polarization can be the sign of\ndramatic changes in the shell itself. We suspect that the\nstrong polarization observed in those two particular objects may be linked with their being in the phase of transition Mira \u2192 OH/IR star.\nReferences\nAlcock, C., & Ross, R.R., 1986, ApJ, 305, 837\nBains, I., Gledhill, T.M., Yates, J.A.; Richards, A.M.S., 2003,\nMNRAS, 338, 287\nBaud, B., Habing, H.J., Matthews, H.E., & Winnberg A., 1981,\nA&A, 95, 156\nBaud, B., & Habing, H.J., 1983, A&A, 127, 73\nBedijn, P.J., 1988, A&A, 205, 105\nBowers, P.F., Johnston, K.J., & de Vegt, C., 1989, ApJ 340,\n479\nChapman, J.M., & Cohen, R.J., 1985, MNRAS, 212, 375\nChapman, J.M., Cohen, R.J., Saikia, D.J., 1991, MNRAS, 249,\n227\nChapman, J.M., Sivagnanam, P., Cohen, R.J., & Le Squeren\nA.M., 1994, MNRAS, 268, 475\nCohen, R.J., 1987, Appenzeller, I., & Jordan, C., Eds Proc.\nIAU Symp. 122, Circumstellar Matter, Reidel, Dordrecht,\np. 229\nCollison, A.J., & Nedoluha, G.E., 1995, ApJ, 442, 311\nCook, A.H., 1966, Nature, 211, 503\nCook, A.H., 1977, Celestial masers, Cambridge University\nPress\nCooke, B., & Elitzur, M., 1985, ApJ, 295, 175\nDavid, P., Le Squeren, A.M., Sivagnanam, P., & Braz M.A,\n1993a, A&A Suppl.

Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\nAppendix A: Remarks on individual sources\nA.1. \"Mira-like\"\nIRAS 15226\u22123603 : We did not detect any emission\nfrom this source either at 1665 or at 1667 MHz in March\n1994 although Sivagnanam et al. (1990) clearly detected\na signal at 1667 MHz in July 1986 with an intensity of\n0.46 Jy for the strongest spectral profile component. At\nthe time of the observations by Sivagnanam et al. this\nsource was not detected at 1612 MHz, thus this Mira is\ncertainly a type I.\nIRAS 15262+0400 : At the time of our observations\nthis source showed an intensity at 1667 MHz seven times\ngreater than that observed by Sivagnanam et al. (1990)\nin July 1986. Nevertheless, the intensity ratio Ired peak /\nIblue peak (where \"red peak\" and \"blue peak\"stand for the\nred-shifted and blue-shifted emission respectively) stayed\nthe same. We detected faint non-polarized emission\n(\u2243 0.2 K) at 1665 MHz internal in velocity to that\nobserved at 1667 MHz (where \"internal (in velocity)\"\nshould be understood as defined in Sect. 3, meaning in\nthis case that the signal is located between the blue and\nred peaks observed at 1667 MHz).\nIRAS 20396\u22120826 : This identified Mira, also known\nas XX Aqr, has an optical period of 334 days (Kholopov\net al. 1985, GCVS). It was classified by Sivagnanam\net al. (1990) as a \"peculiar object\" due to the difference\nbetween the spectral profile shape observed at 1612 and\nthat observed at 1667 MHz. The 1612 MHz emission\nshows a double-peaked profile covering a velocity range\nof 6 km s\u22121 . The 1667 MHz emission observed by\nSivagnanam et al. is internal in velocity to that observed\nat 1612 MHz and has a plateau-shaped profile. Our\nobservations show that the 1665 MHz emission is internal\nin velocity to that observed at 1667 MHz with a single\npeak centred on the stellar velocity. A strong acceleration\n(\u01eb > 1) at the location of the 1665 MHz emission could\nproduce such a spectral profile shape (cf. Chapman &\nCohen 1985), strengthening the hypothesis of a velocity\ngradient in the OH shell of this source as proposed by\nSivagnanam et al..\nIRAS 20547+0247 : This source, also known as U Equ,\nwas indexed by Sivagnanam et al. as the Mira having the\nsmallest expansion velocity with a value of 2.4 km s\u22121\n(cf. their Table 1). The 1667 MHz intensity of this source\nhas substantially dropped. The blue-shifted peak which\nwas already very faint at the time of the observations\nby Sivagnanam et al. in May 1987 is no longer detected\nin our observations. We detected a very faint 1665 MHz\nsignal only in the red-shifted peak centred at the same\nvelocity as the emission we observed at 1667 MHz.\nIRAS 22525+6033 : Sivagnanam et al. classified\nthis source as a \"peculiar object\" due to its spectral\n\nFig. A.1. Stokes V spectra of IRAS 22525+6033: a) at\n1665 MHz, b) at 1667 MHz. V* is the stellar velocity\ninferred from the present work\n\nprofile at 1667 MHz. Our observations indeed confirm\nthe non-standard profile shape in both main lines, with\nmultiple components quite well detached most of which\nare strongly right-hand polarized (cf. Fig A.1 showing\nthe Stokes V spectra for both main lines). The resulting\nspectral profiles in the two circular polarizations are\ntherefore very different (cf. Fig B.1). Sivagnanam et al.\ninferred an expansion velocity of 4.4 km s\u22121 . From our\nobservations we infer an expansion velocity more than\ntwice that value : 9\u221210 km s\u22121 .\n\nA.2. OH/IR stars from the LDSS region\nIRAS 17482\u22122824 : Emission at 1667 and 1665 MHz is\npresent. The velocity location for the red- and blue-shifted\npeaks is about the same in both lines but the 1667-MHz\nred-shifted peak emission overshoots that at 1665 MHz\nby about 1 km s\u22121 . Even though there is a separation\nof two years between the 1667-MHz observations made\nby David et al. (1993a) and ours, there is no significant\nchange in the spectral profile and intensity ratio Ired peak /\n\n\fS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\n9\n\nIblue peak .\nIRAS 17505\u22123143 : The comparison between the\n1667-MHz observations made by David et al. (1993a)\nand ours showed a noticeable change in both the flux\nand the intensity ratio Ired peak / Iblue peak between the\ntwo epochs of observations. We did not detect any\n1665 MHz emission. This source was observed repeatedly\nat 1612 MHz. In particular, te Lintel et al. (1991)\nobserved it in November 1985. They found an expansion\nvelocity of 15 km s\u22121 with the blue- and red-shifted peaks\nlocated at \u221212.2 and +19.2 km s\u22121 respectively (cf. their\nTable 2). From our 1667 MHz observation we found the\nblue- and red-shifted peaks to be centred at \u221212.9 and\n+20.3 km s\u22121 respectively and an expansion velocity of\n16.6 km s\u22121 in agreement with David et al. (1993a). This\nimplies that the 1667 MHz red-shifted peak overshoots\nthat at 1612 MHz by about 1 km s\u22121 .\nIRAS 19075+0921 : The spectral profile of this source\nshows detached multi-components in both main lines\nleading to a non-standard shape, particularly noticeable\nat 1665 MHz. Like IRAS 22525+6033, this source shows\na strong degree of polarization. Nevertheless, in this\nobject the left-handed polarization prevails as can be\nseen in Fig. A.2 which displays the Stokes V spectra\nin both main lines. As a result of the strong degree of\ncircular polarization of some of the spectral components,\nthe profile is quite different in both circular polarizations\nfor both main lines. The 1667 MHz spectrum profile\nobtained by Le Squeren et al. (1992) in January 1986 is\nsimilar to ours. The intensity ratio Ired peak / Iblue peak\ndid not show any significant change bewteen the two sets\nof observations. We also found the same characteristic\nvelocities as those given by Le Squeren et al. (1992, their\nTable 1).\nIRAS 19161+2343 : We detected only a very faint and\nnarrow emission in the red-shifted peak at 1665 MHz. The\n1667 MHz red-shifted peak overshoots that at 1665 MHz\nby \u223c1 km s\u22121 . No significant change in the profile shape\ncan be seen between the observations made by David\net al. (1993a) in May 1990 and ours.\nIRAS 19190+1128 : This source shows very faint and\nasymmetric emission at 1667 MHz. In particular, the\nblue-shifted peak hardly reached a 2\u03c3 detection. We do\nnot notice any significant change in the profile shape\nbetween the observations made by David et al. (1993a) in\nAugust 1986 and ours, performed 8 years later. We did\nnot detect any emission at 1665 MHz.\nIRAS 19244+1115 : This source, also known as\nIRC 10420, has quite a broad spectral profile. Because\nof the protocol of our observations the red-shifted part of\nthe spectra has been cut. Indeed, if we refer to the observations made by David et al. (1993a) at 1667 MHz, we\ncan clearly see the existence of a strong red-shifted com-\n\nFig. A.2. Stokes V spectra of IRAS 19075+0921: a) at\n1665 MHz, b) at 1667 MHz\n\nponent centred at +110 km s\u22121 , outside our bandwidth\ncoverage. Although it was covered by our bandwidth, we\ndid not detect the most blue-shifted component centred\nat +41 km s\u22121 seen in the profile published by David\net al.. That is most probably due to the \"band edge effects\" concerning the first and last 5 to 10 channels of the\nband. Due to the inadequate protocol of observation for\nthis particular source, the stellar and expansion velocities\ngiven in Tables C.1 and C.2 should be treated with caution. This source was not used in the statistical study on\nthe expansion velocity presented in Sect. 4.4.\n\nA.3. OH/IR stars from the R2 region\nIRAS 17220\u22122448 : We did not detect any emission\nat 1667 MHz, but a faint, narrow left-hand polarized\ncomponent centred at V=+45.3 km s\u22121 was detected\nat 1665 MHz. Considering the velocity characteristics\ngiven by David et al. (1993a, V\u2217 =+39.4 km s\u22121 and\nVexp =15.4 km s\u22121 ) this component should be an OH\nmaser signature of an inner region belonging to the back\npart of the shell.\n\n\f10\n\nS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\nIRAS 17317\u22123331 : The 1667 MHz emission of this\nsource exhibits an inter-peak signal. At 1665 MHz we\nobserved an internal group of components between the\ntwo asymmetrical red- and blue-shifted peaks. This\ninternal peak is centred about the stellar velocity and\nits intensity is of the same order as that observed for\nthe blue-shifted peak. This source was also observed at\n1612 MHz by te Lintel et al. (1991) and by David et al.\n(1993a). From our observations in the main lines, we\nfound the same stellar velocity as David et al. which is in\nagreement with that given by te Lintel et al. considering\ntheir spectral resolution. At 1612 MHz the spectral profile\ndoes not have any noticeable particularity. Both te Lintel\net al. and David et al. classified it in the \"standard\ndouble-peaked profile\" category.\nIRAS 17385\u22123332 : Both main lines exhibit faint emission. The blue-shifted peak is not detected at 1667 MHz\nand only just detected at 1665 MHz. At 1665 MHz, we\nclearly observe an internal peak centred on the stellar\nvelocity, and the bluest narrow component we detected is\ncentred at the same velocity as the 1612 MHz blue-shifted\npeak as given by te Lintel et al. (1991) and David et al.\n(1993b).\nIRAS 17392\u22123319 : We did not detect any emission\nat 1665 MHz. The 1667 MHz emission shows a standard\ndouble-peaked profile. The profile and intensity have not\nshown any noticeable change between our observations\ncarried out in 1994 and those performed by David et al.\n8 years earlier.\nIRAS 17411\u22123154 : The 1665 MHz emission exhibits\na non-standard profile shape where at least 8 well-defined\ncomponents are observed, of which 4 are coming from\nstrong internal emission. Interestingly, the back part of\nthe shell (i.e., V>V\u2217 ) shows quite strong right-handed\npolarization while the front part (i.e., V<V\u2217 ) is left-hand\npolarized (Fig. A.3). A similar phenomenon has already\nbeen observed in other sources (i.e., Ukita & Le Squeren\n1984; Szymczak et al. 2001), and can be explained by\nthe Cook mechanism when the magnetic field is aligned\non the line of sight (Cook 1966, 1977). The 1667 MHz\nspectral profile is more typical although showing interpeak emission. This source also exhibits strong 1612 MHz\nemission with intensity reaching a value as high as\n200-300 Jy (cf. Table 2 of te Lintel et al. 1991 and Table 1\nof David et al. 1993b). The expansion velocity inferred\nat 1612 MHz is of the same order as that inferred at\n1667 MHz (i.e., 18.5 km s\u22121 , Table C.2). On the other\nhand, the most red-shifted part of the 1665 MHz emission\nwas not detected, leading to a much smaller expansion\nvelocity in that line.\nIRAS 17418\u22122713 : This source shows a single component at 1665 MHz centred about V=\u221221 km s\u22121 , that\nis about the mid-point between the stellar velocity and\nthe 1667 MHz blue peak velocity. The expansion velocity\n\nFig. A.3. Stokes V spectrum of IRAS 17411\u22123154 at\n1665 MHz.\ninferred at 1667 MHz is more than 1 km s\u22121 greater\nthan that inferred by David et al. (1993b) and te Lintel\net al. (1991) from the 1612 MHz emission. This is due\nto an overshoot of the 1667 MHz blue peak over that at\n1612 MHz.\nIRAS 17550\u22122120 : Emission is observed in both\nmain lines but with an inverse intensity ratio Ired peak /\nIblue peak . The 1667 MHz profile underwent a strong\nchange of shape since 1987 when a triple-peaked profile\nshape was observed (cf. Fig. 2 of David et al. 1993a)\nwhile we detected only the two standard peaks. The\nextra internal component centred about V=\u221217 km s\u22121\ndetected by David et al. vanished between the two epochs\nof observation. The nature of this event is unclear since\nthe source has not been monitored.\nIRAS 18033\u22122111 : It seems that the OH emission\nreported by David et al. (1993a, their Fig. 2 and Table 1)\ncorresponds to two distinct sources : one emitting in\nthe velocity range [-130;-100] km s\u22121 (the one we observed) and the second emitting in the velocity range\n[-70;-30] km s\u22121 . The 1612 MHz observations reported\nby te Lintel et al. (1991) and David et al. (1993b)\ndeal with the velocity range [-70;-30] km s\u22121 . To our\nknowledge no observation has been done at 1612 MHz in\nthe velocity range [-130;-100] km s\u22121 . At the date of our\nobservation neither 1667 MHz nor 1665 MHz emissions\nwere detected while David et al. (1993a) clearly reported\nemission at 1667 MHz. Thus, the source corresponding\nto the velocity range [-130;-100] km s\u22121 is clearly variable.\nIRAS 18135\u22121456 : The 1667 MHz spectrum of this\nsource shows an asymmetric double-peaked profile. The\n1665 MHz spectrum is internal to that at 1667 MHz\nand emission is observed over the whole velocity range\n(leading to its classification as a plateau-shaped profile).\n\n\fS. Etoka and A.M. Le Squeren: OH spectral evolution of oxygen-rich late-type stars\n\nActually, the two external components (i.e., the bluest\nand reddest Doppler shifted) are those with the faintest\nemission. In particular, if one excepts the strong component centred at V=\u22129.4 km s\u22121 , the general shape of\nthe profile resembles a gaussian. This could be the signature of an acceleration zone (cf. Chapman & Cohen 1985).\nIRAS 18198\u22121249, IRAS 18257\u22121000,\nIRAS 18488\u22120107 and IRAS 19065+0832 : These\nfour sources were observed by Dickinson & Turner (1991)\nin both main lines. All four sources show a standard\ndouble-peaked profile at 1667 MHz. We did not notice\nany significant change in their spectral profiles. We did\nnot detect any 1665 MHz either for IRAS 18198\u22121249\nor for IRAS 18488\u22120107. We positively detected\nIRAS 18257\u22121000 and IRAS 19065+0832 at 1665 MHz.\nDickinson & Turner classified IRAS 18198\u22121249,\nIRAS 18257\u22121000 and IRAS 18488\u22120107 as sources\nfor which the 1667 MHz emission overshoots that at\n1612 MHz.\nIRAS 18348\u22120526 : This source shows a strong interpeak emission at 1667 MHz. At 1665 MHz we also noted\na non-zero inter-peak emission whose shape resembles a\nvery flat-topped gaussian centred on the stellar velocity.\nThis kind of shape is similar to that presented by Bowers\n(1991) for an isotropic outflow in a spherical circumstellar\nshell with significant rotation. This hypothesis would\nimply a non-negligible rotation component in the external\nregions of the circumstellar shell considering the radius\nexpected for the OH formation (Goldreich & Scoville\n1976, Huggins & Glassgold 1982). This is very unlikely.\nAnother more credible hypothesis regards the emission\nas the sum of two components. The first component,\ncoming from an external OH region expanding radially\nwith an acceleration such as 1 > \u01eb > 0, would give the\nstandard red- and blue-shifted peaks with possibly a\nfaint inter-peak signal. The second component would\ncome from an inner OH strongly accelerating zone with\n\u01eb > 1, given the internal gaussian-like emission observed\n(cf. Chapman & Cohen 1985, their Fig. 3). This scenario\nis sustained by the 1667 MHz profile shape which also\nshows an inter-peak signal, strengthening the hypothesis\nthat some acceleration is still present at the location of\nthe main-line maser emission.\nIRAS 18432\u22120149, IRAS 18460\u22120254 and\nIRAS 19254+1631 : The first two sources show faint\nemission at 1665 MHz barely above the noise threshold.\nThe 1667 MHz spectra for all three sources did not show\nany significant change between the observations carried\nout by David et al. (1993a) and ours.\nIRAS 19352+2030 : At 1667 MHz we detected emission from three peaks centred at V=\u22128.70, \u22121.4 and\n+7.0 km s\u22121 . The two most red- and blue-shifted peaks\nare very faint. Only the central peak at V=\u22121.40 km s\u22121\nwas detected by David et al. (1993a). We also detected\n\n11\n\nemission at 1665 MHz centred at V=\u22121.40 km s\u22121 . This\npeak is significantly left-hand polarized (i.e., 15-20%)\nin both main lines. This source was also observed at\n1612 MHz by David et al. (1993b). They only detected a\nsingle peak centred at V=\u22123.22 km s\u22121 .\nIRAS 22177+5936 : At 1667 MHz this source shows\na double-peaked profile with strong emission between the\nthe red- and blue-shifted peaks. At 1665 MHz only the\nblue-shifted peak is clearly detected. The red-shifted peak\nis barely above the noise threshold in right-handed polarization. The spectral profiles obtained by Dickinson &\nTurner (1991) are similar to ours for both main lines.\nThis source was also observed at 1612 MHz by te Lintel\net al. (1991). The characteristic velocities they found are\nin agreement with ours.\n\nAppendix B: Spectral line atlas\nAppendix C: Spectral measurement results\n\n\f12\n\nS. Etoka and A.M.
