The\nphoton spectrum above 200 GeV is fit by a power law dN/dE = F0 (E/E0 )\u2212\u0393\nwith a photon index \u0393 of 4.4 \u00b1 0.8stat \u00b1 0.3syst and a flux normalization F0 of\n(2.3 \u00b1 0.5stat \u00b1 1.2sys ) \u00d7 10\u221211 TeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 with E0 = 300 GeV. No VHE variability is detected during VERITAS observations of RX J0648.7+1516 between\n2010 March 4 and April 15. Following the VHE discovery, the optical identification and spectroscopic redshift were obtained using the Shane 3\u2013m Telescope at\nthe Lick Observatory, showing the unidentified object to be a BL Lac type with a\nredshift of z = 0.179. Broadband multiwavelength observations contemporaneous\nwith the VERITAS exposure period can be used to sub-classify the blazar as a\nhigh-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) object, including data from the MDM observatory, Swift-UVOT and XRT, and continuous monitoring at photon energies\nabove 1 GeV from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We find that in the\nabsence of undetected, high-energy rapid variability, the one-zone synchrotron\nself-Compton model (SSC) overproduces the high-energy gamma-ray emission\nmeasured by the Fermi -LAT over 2.3 years. The SED can be parameterized satisfactorily with an external-Compton or lepto-hadronic model, which have two\n\n19\n\n25\n\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.\n\n26\n\nInstituto de Astronomia y Fisica del Espacio, Casilla de Correo 67 - Sucursal 28, (C1428ZAA) Ciudad\nAutnoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n27\n\nInstitut f\u00fcr Physik und Astronomie, Universit\u00e4t Potsdam, 14476 Potsdam-Golm,Germany\n\n28\n\nDepartment of Applied Physics and Instrumentation, Cork Institute of Technology, Bishopstown, Cork,\nIreland\n29\n\nArgonne National Laboratory, 9700 S.

This source was flagged as a\nvery-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) emitting candidate by the Fermi -LAT collaboration\nby searching for \u226530 GeV photons. This information triggered the VERITAS observations\nreported here. 1FGL J0648.8+1516 is found to be associated with RX J0648.7+1516, which\nwas first discovered by ROSAT (Brinkmann et al. 1997). A radio counterpart was identified\nin the NRAO Green Bank survey (Becker et al. 1991). Two subsequent attempts to identify\nan optical counterpart were unsuccessful (Motch et al. 1998; Haakonsen et al. 2009).\nAt 6\u25e6 off the Galactic plane and without optical spectroscopy, the nature of this object\nremained unknown until optical spectroscopy was obtained in response to the VERITAS\ndetection. These observations allow the active galactic nucleus (AGN) to be classified as a\nBL Lac, a type of AGN that has a jet co-aligned closely with the Earth's line of sight and\ndisplays weak emission lines. These AGN are characterized by non-thermal, double-peaked\nbroadband spectral energy distributions (SED). Based on the radio and X-ray flux, the BL\nLac can further be classified as a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) (Padovani & Giommi\n1995), or if classified by the location of its low-energy peak, a high-synchrotron-peaked BL\nLac (HSP) (Abdo et al. 2010b).\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Analysis\n2.1.\n\nVERITAS\n\nVERITAS comprises four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes and is sensitive\nto gamma-rays between \u223c100 GeV and \u223c30 TeV (Weekes et al. 2002; Holder et al. 2006).\nThe VERITAS observations of RX J0648.7+1516 were completed between 2010 March 4 and\nApril 15 (MJD 55259-55301), resulting in 19.3 hours of quality-selected live time. These\nobservations were taken at 0.5\u25e6 offset in each of four directions to enable simultaneous background estimation using the reflected-region method (Fomin et al. 1994).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n\n72\n\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n\nThe VERITAS events are parameterized by the principal moments of the elliptical\nshower images, allowing cosmic-ray background rejection through a set of selection criteria\n(cuts) which have been optimized a priori on a simulated, soft-spectrum (photon index 4.0)\nsource with a VHE flux 6.6% of that observed from the Crab Nebula. The cuts discard\nimages with fewer than \u223c50 photoelectrons. Events with at least two telescope images\nremaining are then cosmic-ray discriminated based on the mean-scaled-width (MSW) and\nthe mean-scaled-length (MSL) parameters. Events with MSW < 1.1, MSL < 1.4, a height of\nmaximum Cherenkov emission > 8 km and an angular distance to the reconstructed source\nposition in the camera (\u03b8) of less than 0.14 degrees are kept as gamma-ray candidate events.\nThe results are reproduced in two independent analysis packages (Cogan 2008; Daniel 2008).\nAfter background rejection, 2711 events remain in the source region, with 16722 events\nremaining in the background regions (larger by a factor of 6.89). The 283 excess events\nresult in a significance of 5.2\u03c3, calculated using Equation 17 from Li & Ma (1983).\nA differential power law dN/dE = Fo (E/300 GeV)\u2212\u0393 is fit to the VERITAS data\nfrom 200 to 650 GeV, shown in the top panel of Figure 1. The fit (\u03c72 = 0.90 with 3\ndegrees of freedom (DOF), probability of 0.83) results in a flux normalization of Fo = (2.3 \u00b1\n0.5stat \u00b1 1.2syst ) \u00d7 10\u221211 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 and an index of \u0393 = 4.4 \u00b1 0.8stat \u00b1 0.3syst ,\ncorresponding to 3.3% of the Crab Nebula flux above 200 GeV.\nThe angular distribution of the excess events is consistent with a point source now\ndesignated VER J0648+152, located at 102.19\u25e6 \u00b1 0.11\u25e6stat RA and 15.27\u25e6 \u00b1 0.12\u25e6stat Dec\n(J2000). The systematic pointing uncertainty of VERITAS is less than 25\u2032\u2032 (7\u00d710\u22123 degrees).\nThis position is consistent with the radio position of RX J0648.7+1516 (Becker et al. 1991).\nA nightly-binned VHE light curve is fit with a constant and shows a \u03c72 null hypothesis\nprobability of 0.39, showing no significant variability during the observation.\n\n2.2.\n\nFermi -LAT\n\nThe Fermi -LAT is a pair-conversion telescope sensitive to photons between 20 MeV\nand several hundred GeV (Atwood et al. 2009; Abdo et al. 2009). The data used in this\npaper encompass the time interval 2008 Aug 5 through 2010 Nov 17 (MJD 54683-55517),\nand were analyzed with the LAT ScienceTools software package version v9r15p6, which\nis available from the Fermi Science Support Center (FSSC). Only events from the \"diffuse\"\nclass with energy above 1 GeV within a 5\u25e6 radius of RX J0648.7+1516 and with a zenith\nangle < 105\u25e6 were used. The background was parameterized with the files gll iem v02.fit and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n80\n81\n82\n\n83\n84\n85\n86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n\nisotropic iem v02.txt 1 . The normalizations of the components were allowed to vary freely\nduring the spectral point fitting, which was performed with the unbinned likelihood method\nand using the instrument response function P6 V3 DIFFUSE.\nThe spectral fits using energies above 1 GeV are less sensitive to possible contamination\nfrom unaccounted (transient) neighboring sources, and hence have smaller systematic errors,\nat the expense of slightly reducing the number of source photons. Additionally, there is no\nsignificant signal from RX J0648.7+1516 below 1 GeV. The analysis of 2.3 years between\n2008 Aug 5 and 2010 Nov 17 (MJD 54683\u201355517) of Fermi -LAT events with energy between\n0.3\u20131 GeV (fixing the spectral index to 1.89) yields a test statistic (TS) of 9, corresponding\nto \u223c 3\u03c3 2 . In addition to the background, the emission model includes two nearby sources\nfrom the 1FGL catalog: the pulsars PSR J0659+1414 and PSR J0633+1746. The spectra\nfrom the pulsars are parameterized with power-law functions with exponential cutoffs, and\nthe values are fixed to the values found from 18 months of data. The spectral fluxes are\ndetermined using an unbinned maximum likelihood method. The flux systematic uncertainty\nis estimated as 5% at 560 MeV and 20% at 10 GeV and above.3\nThe results from the Fermi -LAT spectral analysis are shown in the bottom panel of\nFigure 1. There is no variability detected in four time bins evenly spread over the 2.3\nyears of data. The dataset corresponding in time to the VERITAS observations between\nbetween 2010 March 4 and April 15 (i.e. MJD 55259\u221255301) does not show any significant\nsignal and thus we report 2\u03c3 upper limits that were computed using the Bayesian method\n(Helene 1983), where the likelihood is integrated from zero up to the flux that encompasses\n95% of the posterior probability. When using the data accumulated over the expanded full\n2.3 years of data, we find that 1FGL J0648.8+1516 is significantly detected above 1 GeV\nwith a TS of 307. The spectrum is fit using a single power-law function with photon flux\nF>1 GeV = (1.8 \u00b1 0.2stat ) \u00d7 10\u22129 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 and hard differential photon spectral index\n\u0393LAT = 1.89 \u00b1 0.10stat . The analysis is also performed on five energy ranges equally spaced\non a log scale with the photon index fixed to 1.89 and only fitting the normalization. The\nsource is detected significantly (TS>25) in each energy bin except for the highest energy\n(100-300 GeV), for which a 95% confidence level upper limit is calculated.\n1\n\nThe files are available at http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html\n\n2\n\nSee Mattox et al.

Observations were taken in photon counting mode\nwith an average count rate of \u223c 0.3 counts per second and did not suffer from pile-up. Six\ntarget-of-opportunity observations summing to 10.5 ks were collected on six different days\nbetween 2010 March 18 and April 18 (MJD 55273 and 55304), inclusive. These observations\nwere combined with a response file created from summing each observation's exposure file\nusing ximage. The photons are grouped by energy to require a minimum of 30 counts per\nbin, and fit with an absorbed power law between 0.3 and 10 keV, allowing the neutral hydrogen (HI) column density to vary. A HI column density of 1.94 \u00b1 0.14 \u00d7 1021cm\u22122 is found,\nonly slightly higher than the 1.56 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 quoted in Kalberla et al. (2005). The combined X-ray energy spectrum is extracted with a fit (\u03c72 = 114 for 88 DOF, null hypothesis\nprobability of 3.2\u00d710\u22122 ) with a photon index of 2.51 \u00b1 0.06 and an integral flux between 0.3\nand 10 keV of (1.24 \u00b1 0.03stat ) \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 . This corresponds to a 0.3 to 10 keV\nrest frame luminosity of 1.1 \u00d7 1045 ergs s\u22121 . The deabsorbed spectrum is used to constrain\nmodeling.\n\n2.4.\n\nSwift-UVOT\n\nThe Swift-XRT observations were supplemented with UVOT exposures taken in the U,\nUVM2, and UVW2 bands (centered at 8.56 \u00d7 1014 Hz, 1.34 \u00d7 1015 Hz, and 1.48 \u00d7 1015 Hz,\nrespectively; Poole et al. (2008)). The UVOT photometry is performed using the HEASOFT\nprogram uvotsource. The circular source region has a 5\u2032\u2032 radius and the background regions\nconsist of several circles with radii between 10 \u2212 15\u2032\u2032 of nearby empty sky. The results are\nreddening corrected using R(V)=3.32 and E(B-V)=0.14 (Schlegel et al. 1998). The Galactic\nextinction coefficients were applied according to Fitzpatrick (1999), with the largest source\nof error resulting from deredenning. A summary of the UVOT analysis results is given in\nTable 1.\n\n2.5.\n\nOptical MDM\n\nThe region around RX J0648.7+1516 was observed in the optical B, V, and R bands\nwith the 1.3-m McGraw-Hill Telescope of the MDM Observatory on four nights during 2010\nApril 1\u20135 (MJD 55287-55291). Exposure times ranged from 90 sec (R-band) to 120 sec\n(B-band). Each night, five sequences of exposures in B, V, and R were taken. The raw data\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n\nwere bias subtracted and flat-field corrected using standard routines in IRAF4 . Aperture\nphotometry is performed using the IRAF package DAOPHOT on the object as well as five\ncomparison stars in the same field of view. Calibrated magnitudes of the comparison stars\nare taken from the NOMAD catalog5 , and the magnitudes of the object are determined using\ncomparative photometry methods. For the construction of the SED points, the magnitudes\nare extinction corrected based on the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust map with values taken\nfrom NASA Extragalactic Database (NED)6 : AB = 0.618, AV = 0.475, and AR = 0.383.\nThese data (summarized in Table 1) are used to constrain the modeling shown in this work,\nalthough the same conclusions result with the UVOT points as model constraint.\n\n3.\n\n149\n\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n\nSpectroscopic Redshift Measurements\n\nTwo spectra were obtained during the nights of UT 2010 March 18 and 2010 November 6\n(MJD 55245 and 55506, respectively) with the KAST double spectrograph on the Shane 3-m\nTelescope at UCO/Lick Observatory. During the first night, the instrument was configured\nwith a 600/5000 grating and 1.5\u2032\u2032 long slit, covering 4300 \u2212 7100 \u00c5. A single 1800 second\nexposure was acquired. During the night of November 6, another 1800 second exposure was\nacquired with a 600/4310 grism, D55 dichroic, a 600/7500 grating and 2\u2032\u2032 long slit, covering\nthe interval 3500 \u2212 8200 \u00c5. The data were reduced with the LowRedux pipeline7 and flux\ncalibrated using a spectro-photometric star. The flux calibration is uncertain due to nonphotometric conditions. Inspection of the March spectrum reveals Ca H+K absorption lines\nat redshift z = 0.179. This redshift is confirmed in the second spectrum at higher signal-tonoise (S/N) (S/N \u223c 20 in the blue and S/N \u223c 50 in the red) where Ca H+K, G band, Mg I\n\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb 5168, 5174, 5184 and Na I \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb 5891, 5894, 5897 absorption lines with equivalent width\n< 5 \u00c5 are detected (see Figure 2 and Table 2 for details). No Ca H+K break is observed.\nThese spectral features provide evidence for an early-type nature of the blazar host galaxy\nand allow for BL Lac classification, following Marcha et al. (1996) and Healey et al. (2007).\n4\n\nhttp://www.noao.edu/credit.html\n\n5\n\nhttp://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad.html\n\n6\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n7\n\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cxavier/LowRedux/index.html\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n4.\n\n165\n\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n\n188\n\nThe contemporaneous multiwavelength data are matched with archival radio data from\nNED and are shown in Figure 3. Since the radio data are not contemporaneous they are\nshown only for reference. The synchrotron peak appears at a frequency greater than 1016 Hz,\nrepresenting the first subclassification of RX J0648.7+1516, specifically as an HBL. These\ndata are used to test steady-state leptonic and lepto-hadronic jet models for the broadband\nblazar emission. The absorption of VHE gamma rays by the extragalactic background light\n(EBL) is accounted for through application of the Gilmore et al. (2009) EBL model; the\nmodel of Finke et al. (2010) provides comparable results.\nLeptonic models for blazar emission attribute the higher-energy peak in the SED to\nthe inverse-Compton scattering of lower-energy photons off a population of non-thermal,\nrelativistic electrons. These same electrons are responsible for the lower-energy synchrotron\nemission making up the first peak. The target photon field involved in the Compton upscattering can either be the synchrotron photons themselves, as in synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) models, or a photon field external to the jet in the case of external Compton (EC)\nmodels.\nWe use the equilibrium SSC model of B\u00f6ttcher & Chiang (2002), as described in Acciari et al.\n(2009). In this model, the emission originates from a spherical blob of relativistic electrons\nwith radius R. This blob is moving down the jet with a Lorentz factor \u0393, corresponding to\na jet speed of \u03b2\u0393 c. The jet is oriented such that the angle with respect to the line of sight is\n\u03b8obs , which results in a Doppler boosting with Doppler factor D = (\u0393[1 \u2212 \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8obs ])\u22121 . In\norder to minimize the number of free parameters, the modeling is completed with \u03b8obs = 1/\u0393,\nfor which \u0393 = D.\nWithin the model, electrons are injected with a power-law distribution at a rate Q(\u03b3) =\nQ0 \u03b3\nbetween the low- and high-energy cut-offs, \u03b31,2 . The electron spectral index of\nq = 4.8 required for the models applied in this work might be the result of acceleration\nin an oblique shock. While standard shock acceleration in relativistic, parallel shocks is\nknown to produce a canonical spectral index of \u223c2.2, oblique magnetic-field configurations\nreduce the acceleration efficiency and lead to much steeper spectral indices (Meli & Quenby\n2003; Sironi & Spitkovsky 2011). The radiation mechanisms considered lead to equilibrium\nbetween the particle injection, radiative cooling and particle escape. The particle escape is\ncharacterized with an efficiency factor \u03b7, such that the escape timescale tesc = \u03b7 R/c, with\n\u03b7 = 100 for this work. This results in a particle distribution streaming along the jet with\na power Le . Synchrotron emission results from the presence of a tangled magnetic field B,\nwith a Poynting flux luminosity of LB . The parameters Le and LB allow the calculation of\nthe equipartition parameter \u01ebBe \u2261 LB /Le .\n\u2212q\n\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\n200\n\nBroadband SED Modeling\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n201\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n209\n210\n211\n\n212\n213\n214\n215\n216\n217\n\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n236\n\nThe top panel in Figure 3 shows the SSC model for RX J0648.7+1516, with parameters\nsummarized in Table 3. The model is marginally in agreement with the data only through use\nof parameters well below equipartition. The Fermi -LAT contemporaneous 95% confidence\nlevel upper limits in the energy ranges 1-3 GeV and 3-10 GeV are just above and below the\none-zone SSC model predictions. Additionally, these SSC model predictions are above the\n2.3 year Fermi -LAT spectrum by more than a factor of 2, although this spectrum is not\ncontemporaneous with the other data. Variation of the model parameters within physically\nreasonable values does not provide better agreement between model and data. Generally,\nHBLs are well characterized by one-zone SSC models and hence these observations might\nsuggest the existence of one or more additional emission mechanisms that contribute to the\nhigher-energy peak.\nAn external-Compton model is also used to describe the data. The EC model is a\nleptonic one-zone jet model with two additional parameters beyond the SSC parameters,\nthe thermal blackbody temperature TEC and radiation energy density uEC of the external\nphoton field, which is assumed to be isotropic and stationary in the blazar rest frame. The\nEC model provides a better representation of the SED, as can be seen in the middle panel\nof Figure 3, with the parameters listed in Table 3.\nA lepto-hadronic model is also applied to the data. Within this model, ultrarelativistic\nprotons are the main source of the high-energy emission through proton synchrotron radiation and pion production. The resulting spectra of the pion decay products are evaluated\nwith the templates of Kelner & Aharonian (2008). Additionally, a semi-analytical description is used to account for electromagnetic cascades initiated by the internal \u03b3\u03b3 absorption\nof multi-TeV photons by both the \u03c0 0 decay photons and the synchrotron emission of ultrarelativistic leptons, as explained in B\u00f6ttcher (2010). Similar to the particle populations in\nthe leptonic models described above, this lepto-hadronic model assumes a power-law distribution of relativistic protons, n(\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212q between a low- and high-energy cut-off, Epmin,max .\nThis population of relativistic protons is propagating along the blazar jet and has a total\nkinetic luminosity of Lp . The lepto-hadronic modeling results are above \u01ebBp equipartition\nand are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 3 with parameters (including energy partition\nfractions \u01ebBp \u2261 LB /Lp and \u01ebep \u2261 Le /Lp ) summarized in Table 3.\nIn conclusion, multiwavelength followup of the VERITAS detection of 1FGL J0648.7+1516\nhas solidified its association with RX J0648.7+1516, which is identified as a BL Lac object\nof the HBL subclass. Other contemporaneous SEDs of VHE-detected HBLs can be well\ndescribed by one-zone SSC models close to equipartition, while for RX J0648.7+1516 this\nmodel provides a poor representation with parameters below equipartition. The addition\nof an external photon field for Compton up-scattering in the leptonic paradigm provides\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n237\n238\n239\n240\n\n241\n242\n\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n\n249\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\n\n259\n260\n261\n\na better representation of the gamma-ray (Fermi and VERITAS) data. Alternatively, a\nlepto-hadronic model is successful in characterizing the higher-energy peak of the SED with\nsynchrotron emission from protons. Both of these latter models require super-equipartition\nconditions.\nThe authors of the paper thank the ApJ referee for the well organized and constructive\ncomments that helped to improve the quality and clarity of this publication.\nVERITAS is supported by the US Department of Energy, US National Science Foundation and Smithsonian Institution, by NSERC in Canada, by Science Foundation Ireland\n(SFI 10/RFP/AST2748), and STFC in the UK.

The\nsolid line shows a power-law fit to the measured flux derived with four equally log-spaced\nbins and a final bin boundary at 650 GeV, above which there are few on-source photons.\nA 99% confidence upper limit evaluated between 650 GeV and 5 TeV assuming a photon\nindex of 4.4 is also shown. The shaded region shows the systematic uncertainty of the fit,\nwhich is dominated by 20% uncertainty on the energy scale. Bottom: The differential photon\nspectrum of RX J0648.7+1516 as measured by Fermi -LAT over 2.3 years between 2008 Aug\n5 and 2010 Nov 17 (MJD 54683\u201355517, grey circles) with the highest energy bin containing a\n95% confidence upper limit.

Fermi -LAT data points are shown for 2.3 years of data along with upper limits extracted from data limited to the VERITAS observation period. The models\nshown here are constrained by the MDM points; modeling constrained by the UVOT data\nproduces similar results. The top panel shows the synchrotron emission (dotted line), the\nself-Compton emission (dashed) and the EBL-corrected (Gilmore et al. 2009) total onezone SSC model (solid). The middle panel shows the synchrotron emission (dotted line),\nthe self-Compton emission (dashed line), the external-Compton (dash-dotted line) and the\nEBL-corrected total EC model (solid). The bottom panel shows the electron (and positron)\nsynchrotron emission (dotted line), the proton synchrotron emission (dash-dotted) and the\nEBL-corrected total lepto-hadronic model (solid).\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
