The main contribution to the quantum noise comes from the output port itself [5]. The\noutput port vacuum field is reflected by the interferometer back towards the photodetector. Its noise spectral density was studied\nin great detail [6, 7]. One can manipulate the dark port field, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the gravitational-wave detection\nin the frequency band of interest. It was proposed by Caves to squeeze the vacuum field [8]. Combined with an appropriate\nfiltering scheme, the increase in sensitivity is limited by the squeezing factor. This was shown for different interferometer\ntopologies [6, 9, 10]. In all these investigations radiation-pressure noise at the beamsplitter was not included.\nIn this paper we analyze the effect of radiation-pressure fluctuations acting on the beamsplitter. We show that it gives rise\nto a coupling of the bright input port to the dark output port. Consequently this paper focusses on the field which enters the\ninterferometer at the bright port, i. e. the input light which comes from the laser. We quantitatively investigate the contributions\nof quantum noise and technical laser noise of the bright input port to the interferometer's noise spectral density of the output\nfield. We show that the coupling strongly depends on the interferometers topology and that technical laser noise might limit the\ndetectors sensitivity at low frequencies.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II, we discuss some general properties of beamsplitters and introduce the\ncoupling equations of the fields. The solution of the coupling equations is presented in section III for a specific configuration,\nthe power-recycled interferometer operating at dark fringe. In section IV, we present the noise spectral density for the current\nset-up of the dual-recycled GEO 600 interferometer and also for its envisioned design parameters. We conclude that in the design\nconfiguration of GEO 600 the dark port noise spectral density might be dominated by technical noise from the bright port at low\nfrequencies. In section V, the same calculations are performed for the advanced LIGO configuration. A quantitative comparison\nshows that the relative contribution of the bright port noise to the output spectral density for advanced LIGO is smaller by five\norders of magnitude than for GEO 600.\nII.\n\nTHE COUPLING EQUATIONS\n\nQuantum fields are usually described by means of their annihilation and creation operators. The two-photon formalism developed by Caves and Schumaker [11] turns out to be a more suitable formalism for measurements with heterodyne or homodyne\ndetectors. These two classes of detectors measure the quadrature fields of the light whose amplitudes annihilate quanta of modulations. Correlations between the two sidebands built up by two-photon processes find a natural representation in that formalism\nand the spectral densities of the two quadratures' quantum noise is given by orthogonal sections through the so called noise\nellipse. Modern publications discussing high-power interferometry show that one can derive simple and easy-to-interpret expressions for the quadrature transfer functions of various configurations [6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14]. Therefore, we present all equations\nin the two-photon formalism benefitting from algebraic properties of the quadrature fields concerning radiation-pressure effects.\nThe two quadrature amplitudes \u00e21 , \u00e22 merge into one single object which we call the quadrature vector:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u00e21\n\u0101 =\n(1)\n\u00e22\n\n\f2\n+\n\u2212\u2745\n\n\u039bn , c\u0304n , d\u0304n\n\u039bw c\u0304w , d\u0304w\n\nP\nP\n\u2747\u2747\n\n\u039be , c\u0304e , d\u0304e\n\n\u012b, \u014d\n\n\u2745\n\nFIG. 1: The noise density of the output field \u014d determines the noise of the gravitational-wave detection. All c\u0304i and the input field \u012b are\npropagating towards the beamsplitter. The fields d\u0304i , \u014d propagate away from it. The asymmetric beamsplitter reflects with a minus sign on the\nside where it is indicated in the picture. The \u039bi denote the classical amplitudes of the carrier in each direction. The south port does not contain\nany carrier field at dark fringe.\n\nMany important physical transformations acting on \u0101 can be interpreted geometrically as rotations and scalings of vectors in the\nspace spanned by the two quadrature fields (i.e. the quadrature space). A more detailed treatment is given in [15]. Our notational\nconventions are introduced in Fig. 1. The classical carrier amplitudes are treated seperately from the modulation amplitudes.\nTherefore, we assume that the expectation values of both components of all quadrature vectors are much smaller than their\ncarrier amplitudes \u039bi . In the literature, one finds different conventions for the phase relations of the various fields which couple\nat the beamsplitter. However, for a lossless beamsplitter one can derive Stokes-like reciprocity relations involving the reflection\nand transmission of light which require that the amplitudes couple at the beamsplitter according to\n\u014d\nd\u0304e\nd\u0304n\nd\u0304w\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03c4c\u0304n \u2212 \u03c1Px c\u0304e\n\u03c4c\u0304w \u2212 \u03c1Px \u012b\n\u03c4 \u012b + \u03c1P\u2212x c\u0304w\n\u03c4c\u0304e + \u03c1P\u2212x c\u0304n\n\n(2)\n\nAn explicit expression for Px is developed in the next section, when the power-recycled Michelson interferometer is discussed.\nAt this point, we state some of its general features. The operator Px counts for the change of phase relations due to displacements\nx\u0302 of the beamsplitter. Therefore, Px can be thought of as a propagator of the field along x\u0302 corresponding to a rotation of the field's\nquadrature vector in quadrature space. Since the coupling equations relate modulation amplitudes, x\u0302 denotes the amplitude for\ndisplacements of the beamsplitter at some frequency \u03a9 which is the modulation frequency of the field. Gravitational waves do not\naffect the motion of the beamsplitter in its own proper reference system and consequently x\u0302 is independent of the gravitationalwave amplitude h. In that case, the equation of motion for x\u0302 is completely determined by the radiation-pressure fluctuations of\nthe light, i.e. by the fluctuations of the amplitude quadratures \u00e21 of all the fields. We derive the equation of motion in terms\nof momentum conservation. The beamsplitter has to compensate for the momentum flow of the ingoing and outgoing fields.\nTherefore, we make the following linearized ansatz in terms of the modulation amplitudes\ne e\nn n\n\u02c6w\n\u02c6e\n\u02c6n\nx\u0302 \u221d \u039bw (\u0109w\n1 + d1 ) \u2212 \u039b (\u01091 + d1 ) + \u039b (\u01091 + d1 ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe minus sign in front of the second bracket means that the momentum assigned to the east fields is carried in the opposite\ndirection with respect to the momentum carried by the west fields, whereas the plus sign in front of the last bracket means that\na motion of the beamsplitter downwards is equivalent to a motion\np towards the east concerning phase shifts of the reflected light.\nThe square root of the spectral density of position fluctuations S(x\u0302) is supposed to be much smaller than the wavelength \u03bb0\nof the carrier light. If that condition were not fulfilled, then the backaction of our measurement device on the test masses would\nbe much larger than typical displacements induced by a gravitational wave (x \u2248 10\u221210 * \u03bb0 , depending on the amplitude of\nthe gravitational wave). If the field which the propagator Px acts on is not accompanied by a high-power carrier amplitude \u039b,\nthen the propagation becomes the unity matrix. In other words, the position fluctuations of the beamsplitter do not generate any\nsidebands, because there is no carrier on which sidebands with significant amplitude could be modulated. Then we obtain the\nfollowing expression for the propagation along small displacements if the interferometer operates at dark fringe\nPx \u012b = \u012b\nPx c\u0304j = c\u0304j \u2212 \u039bj * \u03ba\u0304(c\u0304i , d\u0304i )\n\n(4)\n\nThe vector \u03ba\u0304 is a linear function of x\u0302 and consequently, it depends on all the fields which enter into the equation of motion of\nthe beamsplitter. It should be clear that we just need one variable to determine the position of the beamsplitter since, concerning\nthe phase shift of the reflected fields, a motion of the beamsplitter downwards is completely analogous to a motion to the right.\n\n\f3\nWe are going to add three more equations to our system of coupling relations Eq. (2). The idea is to assign roundtrip\ntransfer functions E, N, W and independent fields \u0113, n\u0304, w\u0304 to three of the four ports. The new fields comprise a sum of all fields\noriginating in the corresponding port , e.g. vacuum fields due to losses or classical signal fields due to a gravitational wave. One\nmay understand this step as some sort of closure of the ports by means of mirrors which reflect the outgoing light back to the\nbeamsplitter.\nc\u0304e = E d\u0304e + \u0113\nc\u0304n = N d\u0304n + n\u0304\nc\u0304w = W d\u0304w + w\u0304\n\n(5)\n\nThe latter equations are the most general, linear equations which govern the roundtrip of the light. In the two-photon formalism,\nthe transfer functions E, N, W are transfer matrices acting on quadrature vectors.\nIII. THE INPUT-OUTPUT RELATION\n\nThe input-output relations of an optical system comprise all contributions to the output field, i. e. the field which is detected\nby the photodiode. It is obtained by solving the coupling equations Eq. (2) and Eq. (5):\n\u014d = IO(\u012b, w\u0304, n\u0304, \u0113)\n\n(6)\n\nWe present the solution of the coupling relations for a power-recycled interferometer with a 50/50 beamsplitter operating at dark\n\nA\n\u03c1pr\n\nW\n\nA\n\nFIG. 2: Power-recycled interferometer. Both arms are described by the same transfer matrix A. The west port contains a power-recycling\nmirror with amplitude reflectivity \u03c1pr . It forms the power-recycling cavity with the endmirrors of the Michelson interferometer. The mirror's\ndistance to the beamsplitter is set to be an integer multiple of the carrier wavelength. The same holds for the pathlength of the light inside the\ntwo interferometer arms.\n\nfringe as shown in Fig. (2):\n\u03c1 = \u03c4 = \u221a12\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u039b := \u039bw = 2\u039be = 2\u039bn\nA := E = N\nW := \u03c1pr (1 + RPE)\n\n50/50 beamsplitter\ndark fringe condition\npower recycling\n\n(7)\n\nThe power-recycling condition means that the transfer function W is a multiple of the identity map except for radiation-pressure\neffects. Without loss of generality, our condition requires that the distance of the beamsplitter to the power-recycling mirror is\na multiple of the carrier wavelength, which also implies that the pathlength of the light inside the Michelson arms is a multiple\nof the carrier wavelength. In fact, the proper power-recycling condition is weaker than the one imposed here for simplicity. The\nproper condition merely requires that the combined pathlength through the Michelson arm and the power-recycling cavity is a\nmultiple of the carrier wavelength. The radiation-pressure induced noise sidebands generated at the beamsplitter are derived\nfrom the matrix for small propagations and from the equation of motion of the beamsplitter. Small propagations Px lead to the\nfollowing transformation of the quadrature vectors [15]:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u03c90 \u039bj\n0\n1 \u2212 \u03c9c0 x\u0302 j\nj\n(8)\nc\u0304\n\u2248\nc\u0304\n+\n\u03c90\n1\nx\u0302(c\u0304i , d\u0304i )\nc\nc x\u0302\nImplicitly, we made use of the fact that c\u0304j is a modulation amplitude of a carrier field whose amplitude \u039bj points in the direction\nof the amplitude quadrature of c\u0304j . The second term on the right-hand side corresponds to the noise sidebands which are excited\n\n\f4\nby fluctuations of the phase \u03c90 x\u0302/c. In the two-photon formalism, phase fluctuations yield fluctuations of the phase quadrature\nwhose noise amplitude is the phase shift multiplied by the amplitude of the carrier field. We assumed that the carrier frequency\n\u03c90 is much higher than the modulation frequency which, henceforth, is denoted by \u03a9. The equation of motion for x\u0302 is governed\nby Newton's law\nx\u0302 = \u2212\n\n\u03b4P (c\u0304i , d\u0304i )\nmc\u03a92\n\n(9)\n\nHere, Newton's equation is written in the domain of modulation frequencies and m is the mass of the beamsplitter. The fluctuating part \u03b4P of the radiation pressure is proportional to the right-hand side of Eq. (3). The constant of proportionality can be\ndetermined by comparing our expression for \u03b4P with expressions evaluated for simpler geometrical situations (e. g. see [6]):\nh\ni\ne e\nn n\n\u02c6w\n\u02c6e\n\u02c6n\n\u03b4P = ~\u03c90 * \u039bw (\u0109w\n(10)\n1 + d1 ) \u2212 \u039b (\u01091 + d1 ) + \u039b (\u01091 + d1 )\nBringing everything together, we cast Eq. (8) into the form\nPx c\u0304j \u2248 c\u0304j \u2212\n\n~\u03c902 \u039b\u039bj\nmc2 \u03a92\n\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n1 e\n1 n\n0 0\nw\nw\ne\nn\n\u221a\n\u221a\n* (c\u0304 + d\u0304 ) \u2212\n(c\u0304 + d\u0304 ) +\n(c\u0304 + d\u0304 )\n1 0\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u039b denotes the amplitude of the light in the west port. Before we write down the input-ouput relation, we introduce the\nabbreviation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~\u03c902 \u039b2\n0 0\n(12)\n, KB =\nK=\n\u2212KB 0\nmc2 \u03a92\nThe coupling constant KB is proportional to the power of the light at the beamsplitter by virtue of P = ~\u03c90 \u039b2 . Inserting\nEq. (11) into the coupling equations and subsequently solving the system of linear equations for the output field, one obtains\nh\n1\n\u014d =\n2(1 \u2212 A\u03c1pr ) \u2212 (2 + (1 \u2212 A)\u03c1pr )(1 + A)K\n(2A(1 \u2212 A\u03c1pr ) + (1 \u2212 (1 + 2\u03c1pr )A)(1 + A)K) \u012b\n\u221a\n+ 2(1 \u2212 A\u03c1pr )n\u0304\n\u221a\n\u2212 2((1 \u2212 A\u03c1pr ) \u2212 (1 + \u03c1pr )(1 + A)K)\u0113\ni\n+(1 + A)2 K w\u0304\n\n(13)\n\nIf the radiation-pressure fluctuations are negligible, then the matrix K becomes zero and the input-output relations reduce to a\nwell-known form. The most interesting aspect of this result is probably contained in the last term within the square brackets.\nIt says that whenever there are radiation-pressure fluctuations acting on the beamsplitter, then fluctuations from the west port\n(also known as the bright port) couple to the output port. This contribution is proportional to the non-zero component of the\nmatrix K. This might turn out to be a problem for all high-power interferometers, since the laser field suffers from high technical\nnoise at low sideband frequencies, which couples into the field w\u0304. The technical noise at low frequencies can be several orders\nhigher compared to pure vacuum fluctuations. The fact that the bright-port dark-port coupling is proportional to K also explains\nwhy the input-output relations are independent of radiation-pressure fluctuations acting on the power-recycling mirror. Those\nfluctuations are described by a matrix K \u2032 which has the same form than K and the transfer is governed by multiplying that\nmatrix with K and K * K \u2032 is always zero.\nIV.\n\nTHE NOISE SPECTRAL DENSITY OF THE GEO 600 TOPOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we calculate the input-output relations of the dual-recycled configuration of GEO 600 and evaluate them in\nterms of the noise spectral density which is obtained under the following assumptions. The state of the input field \u012b at the south\nport is a coherent vacuum field and w\u0304 is the fraction of the laser field which transmits into the power-recycling cavity. Expressed\nin terms of single-sided spectral density matrices these properties assume the form\nS(\u012b) = 1,\n\n2\nS(w\u0304) = \u03c4pr\n* Stech (\u03a9)\n\n(14)\n\nThe matrix Stech is diagonal which means that our calculations do not account for correlations between the two quadratures built\nup inside the laser. The amount of technical noise which is brought into the interferometer by w\u0304 is estimated from measurements\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3: GEO 600 is a dual-recycled Michelson interferometer with a power-recycling mirror in the bright port that enhances the light power\nwithin the Michelson arms and a signal-recycling mirror in the dark port that can be tuned to a specific signal frequency. Since the arms are\nfolded once, the effective armlength is doubled to 1200 m. The distance between the beampslitter and the so called far mirrors of the Michelson\narms is 600 m, whereas the so called near mirrors which form the end of the arms are placed very close to the beamsplitter.\n\nperformed on the GEO 600 laser. Optical losses occuring in real interferometers at the endmirrors or at the beamsplitter are not\nincluded in the sense that we do not mix the fields inside the interferometer with loss related vacuum fields. The value of the\nclassical amplitude of the carrier light at different points of the interferometer is taken from real measurements. The equations\nof motion of all optical components are determined by the light pressure and the action of a gravitational wave. The latter one\ncouples to the fields n\u0304 and \u0113. No significant signal is found in the field w\u0304 since the distance of the power-recycling mirror to\nthe origin of our reference frame (i. e the beamsplitter) is small compared to the lengths of the two Michelson arms. A transfer\nmatrix A for the arms was first presented in [6] and was derived in [15] for the GEO 600 configuration applying the same\nformalism:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\n2i \u03a9L\nc\n(15)\nA=e\n\u2212KA 1\nThe optomechanical coupling constant KA of the Michelson arms is defined similarly to the beamsplitter coupling constant KB\nin Eq. (12) with the amplitude \u039b substituted by the amplitude of the light inside the arms and the beamsplitter mass m substituted\nby the reduced mass for the two endmirrors (each having mass mM ) which form the folded arms of GEO 600 (see Fig. 3):\nKA = 4 *\n\n~\u03c902 (\u039b2 /2)\n(mM /5)c2 \u03a92\n\n(16)\n\nBy folding the arms, the effective armlength L becomes twice the distance between the far mirror and the beamsplitter. A\ngravitational wave h creates signal sidebands in both arms which possess equal amplitudes but different signs\n\u221a\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03a9L\n4~\nKA 0\n, h2SQL =\n(17)\nn\u0304 = \u2212\u0113 = ei c\nhSQL h\n(mM /5)\u03a92 L2\nThe quantity hSQL is the standard quantum limit of GEO 600 with an infinite mass beamsplitter. The \"true\" quantum limit for\nGEO 600 also depends on the dynamics of the beamsplitter. We refrain from redefining hSQL in that manner, since here we want\nto discuss the beamsplitter dynamics explicitely and we do not want to find the reduced mass motion of the system. The problem\nto calculate the phase and coupling constant of a folded arm transfer function is related to the calculation of the same quantities\nfor a delay line. A nice treatment of delay lines in our formalism can be found in the appendix of [13]. For this particular set of\nmatrices [Eqs. (15),(17)], the input-output relation Eq. (13) is given by\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u03a9L\n\u03a9L\n1 0\n0 0\n\u012b + e2i c\nb\u0304 + 2 n\u0304\n(18)\n\u014d = e2i c\n\u2212K1 1\n\u2212K2 0\nWe substituted the field w\u0304 by the transmitted bright port input field w\u0304 = \u03c4pr b\u0304. The two constants K1 and K2 depend on the arm\nand beamsplitter coupling constants\nK1 = KA + 2 cos2 ( \u03a9L\nc ) * KB ,\n\u03c4pr\nK2 = 2 cos2 ( \u03a9L\n\u03a9L * KB\nc )\n1 \u2212 \u03c1pr e2i c\n\n(19)\n\n\f6\nThe coupling constant K2 is a product of 2 cos2 ( \u03a9L\nc ) \u2248 2 and the amplification factor for modulation fields inside the powerrecycling cavity. We should emphasize that K2 is independent of the arm coupling constant KA and thus independent of the arm\ntopology (i. e. whether it is a Michelson interferometer without arm cavities or with arm cavities). However, the modulus of the\nquantity K2 decreases if the arm length L is increased. From Eq. (18) one derives the input-output relation of the signal-recycled\ninterferometer in the usual manner. Propagating fields from the beamsplitter to the signal-recycling mirror is accomplished by\na rotation matrix D(\u03c6) acting in quadrature space which lacks the additional phase shift of the modulation fields since the\nwavelength \u03bb = (2\u03c0c)/\u03a9 of the sidebands within the detection band (i. e. 10 Hz-1000 Hz) is much longer than the length of the\nsignal-recycling cavity [7]\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos(\u03c6) \u2212 sin(\u03c6)\n(20)\nD(\u03c6) =\nsin(\u03c6) cos(\u03c6)\nThe angle \u03c6 is the detuning parameter of the signal-recycling cavity which is formed by the signal-recycling mirror and the\nMichelson interferometer. In Eq. (18), giving names Ti and Tb to the transfer matrices of the fields \u012b and b\u0304 respectively, the\ninput-output relation for the signal-recycled interferometer reads\nh\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u014dsr =\nD(\u03c6)Ti D(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03c1sr * 1 \u012bsr\n1 \u2212 \u03c1sr * D(\u03c6)Ti D(\u03c6)\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011i\n(21)\n+\u03c4sr D(\u03c6) * Tb b\u0304 + 2 n\u0304\nThe input-output relation determines the noise spectral density of the output field. The overall noise density is a sum of the\ntwo densities for the input field \u012bsr and b\u0304. The latter one is the technical noise transferred from the bright port, the former\none is the vacuum noise reflected at the dark port. It is convenient to normalize the spectral densities of the amplitude and\nphase quadratures of \u014dsr such that the spectral density refers to the amplitude h of the gravitational wave which is contain in\nn\u0304. The way how to do this normalization in matrix notation is shown in [9]. The evaluation of the spectral density is based\non the parameter values according to Table I.

The detuning \u03c6 of the signal-recycling cavity can be varied. The\ninput light power at the power-recycling mirror was about 1.5W.\n\ncarrier is resonantly amplified within the signal-recycling cavity. Adjusting the phase of the local oscillator in a homodyne\ndetection scheme (corresponding to the electronic demodulation phase in heterodyne detection schemes), one can choose the\ndirection in quadrature space along which the measurement is carried out. In that manner, the phase quadrature, the amplitude\nquadrature or some intermediate linear combination of these two can be measured. We refer to [16] for a deeper discussion\nof the quantum noise in heterodyne measurement schemes. Here, we restrict to measurements of the phase quadrature. The\nsingle-sided noise spectral density of the phase quadrature of the output field is shown in Fig. 4. The bright port noise at low\nfrequencies causes the optomechanical resonance to disappear from the noise spectral density. On the one hand, this effect is\nmerely of theoretical interest as the currently measured noise density at low frequencies is dominated by seismic noise which\ncouples to the optical fields through the mirror suspension. On the other hand, the result suggests that one has to investigate\nthe role of bright port fluctuations for future interferometers. The beamsplitter coupling constant KB is proportional to the light\npower at the beamsplitter. Therefore, one might expect that the transferred bright port noise becomes even more significant for\nhigh power interferometers of the next generation. The corresponding noise spectral density for GEO 600 with design power\n2\nP = 10 kW and adjusted detuning \u03c6 = 0.003 and transmissivity \u03c4sr\n= 0.16% is shown in Fig. 5 assuming the same relative\ntechnical noise than before. Since the power of the carrier light is higher than in the previous case, all coupling constants are\nincreased and the low frequencies noise experiences a shift upwards. Furthermore, the absolute technical bright-port noise was\nscaled by a factor 10 W/1.5 W derived from the two respective input powers.\nWe conclude this section by suggesting a quantity which best characterizes the impact of the bright-port dark-port coupling\non the output spectral density. That quantity should describe the balance of contributions coming from the bright port and the\n\n\f7\n\u221218\n\nLinear Noise Spectral Density [1/\u221aHz]\n\n10\n\ndark port vacuum noise\ntechnical bright port noise\nbright port vacuum noise\ncombined\n\n\u221219\n\n10\n\n\u221220\n\n10\n\n\u221221\n\n10\n\n\u221222\n\n10\n\n\u221223\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: Single-sided noise spectral density of GEO 600 with P = 300 W at the beamsplitter.

However, the absolute technical noise\nof the input field is increased due to the higher input power of the light Pin = 10 W.\n\ndark port to the output noise. We are looking for a characteristic function of the interferometer topology which is independent of\nthe input power. We derive such a quantity from the input-output relation Eq. (18) by comparing the components of the transfer\nmatrix of the bright port field with the components of the matrix for the dark port field. At low frequencies (i. e. less than 10 Hz)\nit suffices to compare the values of the coupling constants K1 and K2 defined in Eq. (19). Their ratio |K1 |/|K2 | tells us which\nfield mainly determines the fluctuations in the output field \u014d. If the ratio is bigger than one, then the dark port field \u012b dominates.\nIf the ratio is less than one, then the bright port field b\u0304 dominates. We call this ratio the low frequency balance and denote it by\n\u03c3. For GEO 600 without signal-recycling mirror one obtains the following expression:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c4pr KA\n\u03c4pr m + mM /5\n\u03c3conv \u2248\n+1 =\n*\n\u2248 0.5\n(22)\n2\n2KB\n2\nmM /5\nThis equation states that the bright-port fluctuations at low frequencies contribute twice as much as the dark-port fluctuations.\nComparing the result with the noise spectral density of the vacuum fields in Fig. 4, we see that due to the signal-recycling mirror\nthe bright port fluctuations become less important. The reason is that we approximate at frequencies which are less than the\n(half-)bandwidth of the signal-recycling cavity \u03b3sr = 200 Hz. For \u03a9 \u226a 2\u03c0 * \u03b3sr , the signal is weaker with signal-recycling\ncavity compared to a configuration without signal-recycling mirror. The bright port field behaves in the same way as the signal\n\n\f8\nfield whereas the fluctuations from the dark port are nearly unaffected by the signal-recycling mirror. Therefore the noise-tosignal ratio of the dark-port fluctuations is increased with respect to the noise-to-signal ratio of the bright-port field which is not\nchanged by the signal-recycling mirror. Since the detuning of the signal-recycling cavity is very small, we find the following\nbalance for the dual-recycled configuration GEO 600\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c4pr m + mM /5\n\u03c4pr KA\n+1 =\n*\n\u2248 7.7\n(23)\n\u03c3GEO \u2248\n\u03c4sr 2KB\n\u03c4sr\nmM /5\nThat value is in good agreement with the low frequency dark port and bright port vacuum noise in Fig. 4. Inserting the respective\nvalues for the final set-up of GEO 600, the balance is \u03c3fGEO \u2248 15 which also agrees with the spectral densities in Fig. 5.\nV. THE NOISE SPECTRAL DENSITY FOR THE ADVANCED LIGO TOPOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we apply the methods of the last section to the advanced LIGO configuration.

Each arm cavity is formed by an input test mass and an end test mass. The signal-extraction cavity is formed by a mirror in the dark\nport and the interferometer which has the conventional LIGO topology.\n\nformulas which have to be applied for LIGO are identical to the formulas which were derived in the last section. The only\ndifference lies in the definition of the arm coupling constant KA and the signal field in terms of the standard quantum limit\nwhich counts for the arm topology of LIGO (compare with Eq.

The noise spectral density of the output field shown in Fig. 7 lies well\nabove the spectral density of the bright port vacuum and also above the technical noise from the bright port. Again the latter one\nis characterized by the same relative technical noise than in the two cases discussed for GEO 600. The fact that the bright-port\ndark-port coupling is insignificant for LIGO was anticipated and can be further quantified by performing a comparison of the\nbeamsplitter and arm coupling constants. Due to the increased power in the arm cavities, LIGO's arm coupling constant KA is\nmuch bigger than the beamsplitter coupling KB .

The bright-port fluctuations are negligible.\n\nEvaluating the ratio of the two matrix components K1 , K2 of Eq. (18) for a modulation frequency \u03a9 = 2\u03c0 * 10 Hz which is far\nbelow the half-bandwidth of the arm cavities, we obtain\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\nKA\n8\u03a9 m\n4\n2\u03a9\n\u2248 8 * 104 .\n(28)\n+1 \u2248\n\u03c3LIGO \u2248\n2\n\u03c4pr \u03b3 2KB\n\u03c4pr \u03b3 mM \u03c4itm\nComparing with Eq. (23), the result shows that the low frequency balance is five orders of magnitude bigger for LIGO than for\nGEO 600 corresponding to a weaker bright-port contribution to the output field. Even if the technical fluctuations of the input\nlight are two or three orders of magnitude stronger than pure vacuum fluctuations, there will be no noticable contribution to the\nspectral density of the output field.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nWe showed that the bright-port dark-port coupling gives rise to a significant contribution of technical fluctuations to the noise\nspectral density at low frequencies for a Michelson topology without arm cavities. In terms of the low frequency balance, we\nconcluded that the LIGO topology exhibits a comparatively weak bright-port dark-port coupling relative to the contribution of\nthe dark port noise. That is true even for a high level of technical laser noise. There are a couple of strategies to reduce these\nfluctuations at the dark port of the GEO 600 topology. One option is to decrease the transmissivity of the power-recycling mirror.\nThe proposition seems to be in contradiction to Eq. (23) which states that the relative bright-port fluctuations increase with\ndecreasing \u03c4pr . The reason why it works is, that the factor \u03c4pr /2 in front of the brackets has to be replaced by \u03a9L/(\u03c4pr c) if\n2\nthe following condition holds: \u03c4pr\n\u226a \u03a9L/c. The required amplitude transmissivity had to be around 10ppm which lies beyond\n\n\f10\nany practical feasibility and which is not desired for other reasons. The most obvious option is to increase the mass of the\nbeamsplitter without increasing the masses of the endmirrors. One can see from Eq. (23) that the beamsplitter mass has to be\nincreased by two to three orders of magnitude depending on the technical noise which seems to be unfeasible again. The results\nof this paper do not have any practical relevance for currently operated interferometers whose sensitivity at low frequencies is\nlimited not by the technical noise from the bright port, but either by seismic noise or thermal noise. The lasers which furnish\nthe light for interferometers of the next generation are supposed to have a considerably lower amount of relative technical noise.\nTherefore, increasing the mass of the beamsplitter by a modest factor might already be sufficient in order to make the bright port\nfluctuations negligible for the GEO 600 topology. Also strategies which yield an increase of the sensitivity at high frequencies\n[10] are not influenced by our results.\nThere is another generic mechanism existing by which a bright-port dark-port coupling is built up. If the transfer function of\nthe two arms are not equal, then the input-output relation contains the following contribution from the bright port\n\u014d = IO(\u012b, n\u0304, \u0113) +\n\n\u03c1\u03c4 (N \u2212 E)\n* w\u0304\n1 \u2212 (\u03c12 N + \u03c4 2 E) * W\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03c4 denote the amplitude reflectivity and transmissivity of the beamsplitter. There are different reasons why the two\narms are not described by the same transfer function. One reason could be that one arm is detuned intentionally in order to\ntransmit some carrier light towards the detector where it serves as local oscillator for a homodyne measurement of the signal.\nFor a small detuning of just one arm, the carrier light is transmitted into the phase quadrature of \u014d governed by a transfer function\nwhich is proportional to the detuning. If the carrier light is to be transmitted into the amplitude quadrature of \u014d, then one can\nchoose the detuning of one arm to be \u03c0/2 and the detuning of the other arm to be slightly less than \u03c0/2. In that case, the west\nport has to be detuned accordingly to maintain the power-recycling condition (which cannot hold exactly here, since the two\narms are detuned relative to each other). An unintentional reason for different transfer functions of the two arms could be that\nthe transmissivity and the reflectivity of the beamsplitter are not the same. Then, radiation-pressure fluctuations in the two arms\nwould be different by virtue of the different powers of the two respective carrier fields. Carrier light is then transmitted into\nthe phase quadrature of \u014d and the corresponding transfer function is proportional to the difference of the power reflectivity and\ntransmissivity of the beamsplitter. There would also be a small loss of the optical signal due to a partial transmission into the\nbright port which is proportional to the same difference of power reflectivity and transmissivity.\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Y.

The main ontribution to the quantum noise omes from the output port itself [5\u2104.\nThe output port va uum \u0002eld is re\u0003e ted by the interferometer\nba k towards the photodete tor. Its noise spe tral density was\nstudied in great detail [6, 7\u2104. One an manipulate the dark port\n\u0002eld, thereby in reasing the sensitivity of the gravitationalwave dete tion in the frequen y band of interest. It was proposed by Caves to squeeze the va uum \u0002eld [8\u2104. Combined\nwith an appropriate \u0002ltering s heme, the in rease in sensitivity is limited by the squeezing fa tor. This was shown for\ndifferent interferometer topologies [6, 9, 10\u2104. In all these investigations radiation-pressure noise at the beamsplitter was\nnot in luded.\nIn this paper we analyze the effe t of radiation-pressure\n\u0003u tuations a ting on the beamsplitter. We show that it gives\nrise to a oupling of the bright input port to the dark output\nport. Consequently this paper fo usses on the \u0002eld whi h enters the interferometer at the bright port, i. e. the input light\nwhi h omes from the laser. We quantitatively investigate the\nontributions of quantum noise and te hni al laser noise of the\nbright input port to the interferometer's noise spe tral density\nof the output \u0002eld. We show that the oupling strongly depends on the interferometers topology and that te hni al laser\nnoise might limit the dete tors sensitivity at low frequen ies.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In se tion II, we disuss some general properties of beamsplitters and introdu e\nthe oupling equations of the \u0002elds. The solution of the oupling equations is presented in se tion III for a spe i\u0002 on\u0002guration, the power-re y led interferometer operating at dark\nfringe. In se tion IV, we present the noise spe tral density for\nthe urrent set-up of the dual-re y led GEO 600 interferometer and also for its envisioned design parameters. We onlude that in the design on\u0002guration of GEO 600 the dark\nport noise spe tral density might be dominated by te hni al\n\nnoise from the bright port at low frequen ies. In se tion V, the\nsame al ulations are performed for the advan ed LIGO on\u0002guration. A quantitative omparison shows that the relative\nontribution of the bright port noise to the output spe tral density for advan ed LIGO is smaller by \u0002ve orders of magnitude\nthan for GEO 600.\nII.\n\nTHE COUPLING EQUATIONS\n\nQuantum \u0002elds are usually des ribed by means of their annihilation and reation operators. The two-photon formalism\ndeveloped by Caves and S humaker [11\u2104 turns out to be a\nmore suitable formalism for measurements with heterodyne\nor homodyne dete tors. These two lasses of dete tors measure the quadrature \u0002elds of the light whose amplitudes annihilate quanta of modulations. Correlations between the two\nsidebands built up by two-photon pro esses \u0002nd a natural representation in that formalism and the spe tral densities of the\ntwo quadratures' quantum noise is given by orthogonal se tions through the so alled noise ellipse. Modern publi ations\ndis ussing high-power interferometry show that one an derive simple and easy-to-interpret expressions for the quadrature transfer fun tions of various on\u0002gurations [6, 7, 9, 12\u0096\n14\u2104. Therefore, we present all equations in the two-photon formalism bene\u0002tting from algebrai properties of the quadrature\n\u0002elds on erning radiation-pressure effe ts. The two quadrature amplitudes \u00e21 , \u00e22 merge into one single obje t whi h we\nall the quadrature ve tor:\n\u0101 =\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u00e21\n\u00e22\n\n(1)\n\nMany important physi al transformations a ting on \u0101 an be\ninterpreted geometri ally as rotations and s alings of ve tors\nin the spa e spanned by the two quadrature \u0002elds (i.e. the\nquadrature spa e). A more detailed treatment is given in [15\u2104.\nOur notational onventions are introdu ed in Fig. 1.

All c\u0304i and the input \u0002eld \u012b are\npropagating towards the beamsplitter. The \u0002elds d\u0304i , \u014d propagate\naway from it.

Therefore, we assume that the expe tation\nvalues of both omponents of all quadrature ve tors are mu h\nsmaller than their arrier amplitudes \u039bi . In the literature, one\n\u0002nds different onventions for the phase relations of the various \u0002elds whi h ouple at the beamsplitter. However, for a\nlossless beamsplitter one an derive Stokes-like re ipro ity relations involving the re\u0003e tion and transmission of light whi h\nrequire that the amplitudes ouple at the beamsplitter a ording to\n\u014d\nd\u0304e\nd\u0304n\nd\u0304w\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03c4c\u0304n \u2212 \u03c1Px c\u0304e\n\u03c4c\u0304w \u2212 \u03c1Px \u012b\n\u03c4 \u012b + \u03c1P\u2212x c\u0304w\n\u03c4c\u0304e + \u03c1P\u2212x c\u0304n\n\n(2)\n\nAn expli it expression for Px is developed in the next se tion, when the power-re y led Mi helson interferometer is\ndis ussed. At this point, we state some of its general features.\nThe operator Px ounts for the hange of phase relations due\nto displa ements x\u0302 of the beamsplitter. Therefore, Px an be\nthought of as a propagator of the \u0002eld along x\u0302 orresponding to a rotation of the \u0002eld's quadrature ve tor in quadrature spa e. Sin e the oupling equations relate modulation\namplitudes, x\u0302 denotes the amplitude for displa ements of the\nbeamsplitter at some frequen y \u03a9 whi h is the modulation frequen y of the \u0002eld. Gravitational waves do not affe t the motion of the beamsplitter in its own proper referen e system\nand onsequently x\u0302 is independent of the gravitational-wave\namplitude h. In that ase, the equation of motion for x\u0302 is\nompletely determined by the radiation-pressure \u0003u tuations\nof the light, i.e. by the \u0003u tuations of the amplitude quadratures \u00e21 of all the \u0002elds. We derive the equation of motion\nin terms of momentum onservation. The beamsplitter has to\nompensate for the momentum \u0003ow of the ingoing and outgoing \u0002elds. Therefore, we make the following linearized ansatz\nin terms of the modulation amplitudes\ne e\nn n\n\u02c6w\n\u02c6e\n\u02c6n\nx\u0302 \u221d \u039bw (\u0109w\n1 + d1 ) \u2212 \u039b (\u01091 + d1 ) + \u039b (\u01091 + d1 ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe minus sign in front of the se ond bra ket means that the\nmomentum assigned to the east \u0002elds is arried in the oppo-\n\nsite dire tion with respe t to the momentum arried by the\nwest \u0002elds, whereas the plus sign in front of the last bra ket\nmeans that a motion of the beamsplitter downwards is equivalent to a motion towards the east on erning phase shifts of\nthe re\u0003e ted light. The\np square root of the spe tral density of\nposition \u0003u tuations S(x\u0302) is supposed to be mu h smaller\nthan the wavelength \u03bb0 of the arrier light. If that ondition\nwere not ful\u0002lled, then the ba ka tion of our measurement devi e on the test masses would be mu h larger than typi al displa ements indu ed by a gravitational wave (x \u2248 10\u221210 * \u03bb0 ,\ndepending on the amplitude of the gravitational wave). If the\n\u0002eld whi h the propagator Px a ts on is not a ompanied by\na high-power arrier amplitude \u039b, then the propagation beomes the unity matrix. In other words, the position \u0003u tuations of the beamsplitter do not generate any sidebands, beause there is no arrier on whi h sidebands with signi\u0002 ant\namplitude ould be modulated. Then we obtain the following\nexpression for the propagation along small displa ements if\nthe interferometer operates at dark fringe\nPx \u012b = \u012b\nPx c\u0304j = c\u0304j \u2212 \u039bj * \u03ba\u0304(c\u0304i , d\u0304i )\n\n(4)\n\nThe ve tor \u03ba\u0304 is a linear fun tion of x\u0302 and onsequently, it depends on all the \u0002elds whi h enter into the equation of motion\nof the beamsplitter. It should be lear that we just need one\nvariable to determine the position of the beamsplitter sin e,\non erning the phase shift of the re\u0003e ted \u0002elds, a motion of\nthe beamsplitter downwards is ompletely analogous to a motion to the right.\nWe are going to add three more equations to our system\nof oupling relations Eq. (2). The idea is to assign roundtrip\ntransfer fun tions E, N, W and independent \u0002elds \u0113, n\u0304, w\u0304 to\nthree of the four ports. The new \u0002elds omprise a sum of\nall \u0002elds originating in the orresponding port , e.g. va uum\n\u0002elds due to losses or lassi al signal \u0002elds due to a gravitational wave. One may understand this step as some sort of\nlosure of the ports by means of mirrors whi h re\u0003e t the outgoing light ba k to the beamsplitter.\nc\u0304e = E d\u0304e + \u0113\nc\u0304n = N d\u0304n + n\u0304\nc\u0304w = W d\u0304w + w\u0304\n\n(5)\n\nThe latter equations are the most general, linear equations\nwhi h govern the roundtrip of the light. In the two-photon\nformalism, the transfer fun tions E, N, W are transfer matries a ting on quadrature ve tors.\nIII.\n\nTHE INPUT-OUTPUT RELATION\n\nThe input-output relations of an opti al system omprise\nall ontributions to the output \u0002eld, i. e. the \u0002eld whi h is\ndete ted by the photodiode. It is obtained by solving the oupling equations Eq. (2) and Eq.

The radiation-pressure indu ed noise sidebands generated at the beamsplitter are derived from the matrix for small propagations and from the equation of motion of\nthe beamsplitter. Small propagations Px lead to the following\ntransformation of the quadrature ve tors [15\u2104:\n\nA\n\u03c1pr\n\nW\n\nA\n\n\u0012\n\nFIG. 2: Power-re y led interferometer. Both arms are des ribed by\nthe same transfer matrix A. The west port ontains a power-re y ling\nmirror with amplitude re\u0003e tivity \u03c1pr . It forms the power-re y ling\navity with the endmirrors of the Mi helson interferometer. The mirror's distan e to the beamsplitter is set to be an integer multiple of\nthe arrier wavelength. The same holds for the pathlength of the\nlight inside the two interferometer arms.\n\nWe present the solution of the oupling relations for a powerre y led interferometer with a 50/50 beamsplitter operating at\ndark fringe as shown in Fig. (2):\n50/50 beamsplitter\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c4 = \u221a12\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u039b := \u039bw = 2\u039be = 2\u039bn\nA := E = N\nW := \u03c1pr (1 + RPE)\n\ndark fringe ondition\npower re y ling\n(7)\n\nThe power-re y ling ondition means that the transfer fun tion W is a multiple of the identity map ex ept for radiationpressure effe ts.

In fa t, the\nproper power-re y ling ondition is weaker than the one imposed here for simpli ity. The proper ondition merely requires that the ombined pathlength through the Mi helson\n\nPx c\u0304j \u2248 c\u0304j \u2212\n\n~\u03c902 \u039b\u039bj\nmc2 \u03a92\n\nK=\n\n\u0013\n\n0 0\n,\n\u2212KB 0\n\nKB =\n\n~\u03c902 \u039b2\nmc2 \u03a92\n\n(12)\n\nThe oupling onstant KB is proportional to the power of the\nlight at the beamsplitter by virtue of P = ~\u03c90 \u039b2 .

The se ond term on\nthe right-hand side orresponds to the noise sidebands whi h\nare ex ited by \u0003u tuations of the phase \u03c90 x\u0302/c. In the twophoton formalism, phase \u0003u tuations yield \u0003u tuations of the\nphase quadrature whose noise amplitude is the phase shift\nmultiplied by the amplitude of the arrier \u0002eld. We assumed\nthat the arrier frequen y \u03c90 is mu h higher than the modulation frequen y whi h, hen eforth, is denoted by \u03a9.

The most interesting aspe t of this result is probably ontained in the last term within the square\nbra kets. It says that whenever there are radiation-pressure\n\u0003u tuations a ting on the beamsplitter, then \u0003u tuations from\nthe west port (also known as the bright port) ouple to the\noutput port. This ontribution is proportional to the non-zero\nomponent of the matrix K . This might turn out to be a problem for all high-power interferometers, sin e the laser \u0002eld\nsuffers from high te hni al noise at low sideband frequen ies,\nwhi h ouples into the \u0002eld w\u0304. The te hni al noise at low\nfrequen ies an be several orders higher ompared to pure\nva uum \u0003u tuations. The fa t that the bright-port dark-port\noupling is proportional to K also explains why the inputoutput relations are independent of radiation-pressure \u0003u tuations a ting on the power-re y ling mirror. Those \u0003u tuations\nare des ribed by a matrix K \u2032 whi h has the same form than K\nand the transfer is governed by multiplying that matrix with\nK and K * K \u2032 is always zero.\nIV.\n\nTHE NOISE SPECTRAL DENSITY OF THE GEO 600\n\nFIG. 3: GEO 600 is a dual-re y led Mi helson interferometer with\na power-re y ling mirror in the bright port that enhan es the light\npower within the Mi helson arms and a signal-re y ling mirror in the\ndark port that an be tuned to a spe i\u0002 signal frequen y. Sin e the\narms are folded on e, the effe tive armlength is doubled to 1200 m.\nThe distan e between the beampslitter and the so alled far mirrors\nof the Mi helson arms is 600 m, whereas the so alled near mirrors\nwhi h form the end of the arms are pla ed very lose to the beamsplitter.\n\nTOPOLOGY\n\nIn this se tion, we al ulate the input-output relations of the\ndual-re y led on\u0002guration of GEO 600 and evaluate them in\nterms of the noise spe tral density whi h is obtained under\nthe following assumptions. The state of the input \u0002eld \u012b at the\nsouth port is a oherent va uum \u0002eld and w\u0304 is the fra tion of\nthe laser \u0002eld whi h transmits into the power-re y ling avity.\nExpressed in terms of single-sided spe tral density matri es\nthese properties assume the form\nS(\u012b) = 1,\n\n2\nS(w\u0304) = \u03c4pr\n* Stech (\u03a9)\n\n(14)\n\nThe matrix Stech is diagonal whi h means that our al ulations do not a ount for orrelations between the two quadratures built up inside the laser. The amount of te hni al noise\nwhi h is brought into the interferometer by w\u0304 is estimated\nfrom measurements performed on the GEO 600 laser. Opti al\nlosses o uring in real interferometers at the endmirrors or at\nthe beamsplitter are not in luded in the sense that we do not\nmix the \u0002elds inside the interferometer with loss related va uum \u0002elds. The value of the lassi al amplitude of the arrier\nlight at different points of the interferometer is taken from real\nmeasurements. The equations of motion of all opti al omponents are determined by the light pressure and the a tion of\na gravitational wave. The latter one ouples to the \u0002elds n\u0304\nand \u0113. No signi\u0002 ant signal is found in the \u0002eld w\u0304 sin e the\ndistan e of the power-re y ling mirror to the origin of our referen e frame (i. e the beamsplitter) is small ompared to the\nlengths of the two Mi helson arms. A transfer matrix A for\nthe arms was \u0002rst presented in [6\u2104 and was derived in [15\u2104 for\nthe GEO 600 on\u0002guration applying the same formalism:\nA=e\n\n2i \u03a9L\nc\n\n\u0013\n1 0\n\u2212KA 1\n\n\u0012\n\n(15)\n\nThe optome hani al oupling onstant KA of the Mi helson\narms is de\u0002ned similarly to the beamsplitter oupling onstant\nKB in Eq. (12) with the amplitude \u039b substituted by the amplitude of the light inside the arms and the beamsplitter mass m\nsubstituted by the redu ed mass for the two endmirrors (ea h\nhaving mass mM ) whi h form the folded arms of GEO 600\n(see Fig. 3):\nKA = 4 *\n\n~\u03c902 (\u039b2 /2)\n(mM /5)c2 \u03a92\n\n(16)\n\nBy folding the arms, the effe tive armlength L be omes twi e\nthe distan e between the far mirror and the beamsplitter.

The \u0094true\u0094 quantum limit\nfor GEO 600 also depends on the dynami s of the beamsplitter. We refrain from rede\u0002ning hSQL in that manner, sin e\nhere we want to dis uss the beamsplitter dynami s expli itely\nand we do not want to \u0002nd the redu ed mass motion of the\nsystem. The problem to al ulate the phase and oupling onstant of a folded arm transfer fun tion is related to the al ulation of the same quantities for a delay line. A ni e treatment\nof delay lines in our formalism an be found in the appendix\nof [13\u2104. For this parti ular set of matri es [Eqs. (15),(17)\u2104, the\ninput-output relation Eq.

We should emphasize that K2 is independent of the arm oupling onstant KA and thus independent of the arm topology (i. e. whether it is a Mi helson interferometer without arm avities or with arm avities).\nHowever, the modulus of the quantity K2 de reases if the\narm length L is in reased. From Eq. (18) one derives the\ninput-output relation of the signal-re y led interferometer in\nthe usual manner. Propagating \u0002elds from the beamsplitter\nto the signal-re y ling mirror is a omplished by a rotation\nmatrix D(\u03c6) a ting in quadrature spa e whi h la ks the additional phase shift of the modulation \u0002elds sin e the wavelength \u03bb = (2\u03c0c)/\u03a9 of the sidebands within the dete tion\nband (i. e. 10 Hz-1000 Hz) is mu h longer than the length of\nthe signal-re y ling avity [7\u2104\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos(\u03c6) \u2212 sin(\u03c6)\nD(\u03c6) =\nsin(\u03c6) cos(\u03c6)\n\n(20)\n\nThe angle \u03c6 is the detuning parameter of the signal-re y ling\navity whi h is formed by the signal-re y ling mirror and the\nMi helson interferometer. In Eq. (18), giving names Ti and\nTb to the transfer matri es of the \u0002elds \u012b and b\u0304 respe tively,\nthe input-output relation for the signal-re y led interferometer\nreads\n\u014dsr\n\nh\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n=\nD(\u03c6)Ti D(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03c1sr * 1 \u012bsr\n1 \u2212 \u03c1sr * D(\u03c6)Ti D(\u03c6)\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011i\n+\u03c4sr D(\u03c6) * Tb b\u0304 + 2 n\u0304\n(21)\n\nThe input-output relation determines the noise spe tral density of the output \u0002eld. The overall noise density is a sum of\nthe two densities for the input \u0002eld \u012bsr and b\u0304. The latter one is\nthe te hni al noise transferred from the bright port, the former\none is the va uum noise re\u0003e ted at the dark port. It is onvenient to normalize the spe tral densities of the amplitude\nand phase quadratures of \u014dsr su h that the spe tral density\nrefers to the amplitude h of the gravitational wave whi h is\nontain in n\u0304. The way how to do this normalization in matrix notation is shown in [9\u2104. The evaluation of the spe tral\ndensity is based on the parameter values a ording to Table\nI. A detuning \u03c6 = 0.015 means that the sideband whi h\nlies 600 Hz above the arrier is resonantly ampli\u0002ed within\nthe signal-re y ling avity.

The spe tral density of the bright port va uum \u0002eld is lying below the dark port noise spe tral density throughout the entire dete tion band. However, the te hni al noise from the\nbright port is dominating the spe tral density up to 10 Hz where it\nis more than one order of magnitude higher than the va uum noise\ndensity. The te hni al noise orresponds to an input laser \u0002eld with\npower Pin = 1.5 W .\n\nauses the optome hani al resonan e to disappear from the\nnoise spe tral density. On the one hand, this effe t is merely\nof theoreti al interest as the urrently measured noise density\nat low frequen ies is dominated by seismi noise whi h ouples to the opti al \u0002elds through the mirror suspension. On\nthe other hand, the result suggests that one has to investigate\nthe role of bright port \u0003u tuations for future interferometers.\nThe beamsplitter oupling onstant KB is proportional to the\nlight power at the beamsplitter. Therefore, one might expe t\nthat the transferred bright port noise be omes even more signi\u0002 ant for high power interferometers of the next generation.\n\n\f6\nThe orresponding noise spe tral density for GEO 600 with\ndesign power P = 10 kW and adjusted detuning \u03c6 = 0.003\nand transmissivity \u03c4sr2 = 0.16% is shown in Fig. 5 assuming the same relative te hni al noise than before.

Comparing the result with the noise spe tral density of the va uum \u0002elds in Fig. 4, we see that due to the\nsignal-re y ling mirror the bright port \u0003u tuations be ome\nless important. The reason is that we approximate at frequenies whi h are less than the (half-)bandwidth of the signalre y ling avity \u03b3sr = 200 Hz. For \u03a9 \u226a 2\u03c0 * \u03b3sr , the signal\nis weaker with signal-re y ling avity ompared to a on\u0002guration without signal-re y ling mirror. The bright port \u0002eld\nbehaves in the same way as the signal \u0002eld whereas the \u0003u tuations from the dark port are nearly unaffe ted by the signalre y ling mirror. Therefore the noise-to-signal ratio of the\ndark-port \u0003u tuations is in reased with respe t to the noiseto-signal ratio of the bright-port \u0002eld whi h is not hanged by\nthe signal-re y ling mirror. Sin e the detuning of the signalre y ling avity is very small, we \u0002nd the following balan e\nfor the dual-re y led on\u0002guration GEO 600\n\n10\n\n\u03c3GEO\n\u221224\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\nFrequency [Hz]\n\n3\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5: Single-sided spe tral density of the dark-port \u0002eld for the\nGEO 600 topology with design power P = 10 kW at the beamsplitter assuming the same relative te hni al noise here than for the\nlow power interferometer underlying Fig. 4. However, the absolute\nte hni al noise of the input \u0002eld is in reased due to the higher input\npower of the light Pin = 10 W.\n\npower of the arrier light is higher than in the previous ase,\nall oupling onstants are in reased and the low frequen ies\nnoise experien es a shift upwards. Furthermore, the absolute\nte hni al bright-port noise was s aled by a fa tor 10 W/1.5 W\nderived from the two respe tive input powers.\nWe on lude this se tion by suggesting a quantity whi h\nbest hara terizes the impa t of the bright-port dark-port oupling on the output spe tral density. That quantity should\ndes ribe the balan e of ontributions oming from the bright\nport and the dark port to the output noise. We are looking for\na hara teristi fun tion of the interferometer topology whi h\nis independent of the input power. We derive su h a quantity\nfrom the input-output relation Eq. (18) by omparing the omponents of the transfer matrix of the bright port \u0002eld with the\nomponents of the matrix for the dark port \u0002eld. At low frequen ies (i. e. less than 10 Hz) it suf\u0002 es to ompare the values of the oupling onstants K1 and K2 de\u0002ned in Eq. (19).\nTheir ratio |K1 |/|K2 | tells us whi h \u0002eld mainly determines\nthe \u0003u tuations in the output \u0002eld \u014d. If the ratio is bigger\nthan one, then the dark port \u0002eld \u012b dominates. If the ratio is\nless than one, then the bright port \u0002eld b\u0304 dominates. We all\nthis ratio the low frequen y balan e and denote it by \u03c3.

In terms of the low frequen y balan e, we on luded that the LIGO topology exhibits a omparatively weak bright-port dark-port oupling\nrelative to the ontribution of the dark port noise. That is\ntrue even for a high level of te hni al laser noise. There are\na ouple of strategies to redu e these \u0003u tuations at the dark\nport of the GEO 600 topology. One option is to de rease the\ntransmissivity of the power-re y ling mirror. The proposition\nseems to be in ontradi tion to Eq. (23) whi h states that the\nrelative bright-port \u0003u tuations in rease with de reasing \u03c4pr .\nThe reason why it works is, that the fa tor \u03c4pr /2 in front of\nthe bra kets has to be repla ed by \u03a9L/(\u03c4pr c) if the follow2\n\u226a \u03a9L/c. The required amplitude\ning ondition holds: \u03c4pr\ntransmissivity had to be around 10ppm whi h lies beyond any\npra ti al feasibility and whi h is not desired for other reasons.\nThe most obvious option is to in rease the mass of the beamsplitter without in reasing the masses of the endmirrors. One\nan see from Eq. (23) that the beamsplitter mass has to be inreased by two to three orders of magnitude depending on the\nte hni al noise whi h seems to be unfeasible again. The results of this paper do not have any pra ti al relevan e for urrently operated interferometers whose sensitivity at low fre-\n\n\f8\nquen ies is limited not by the te hni al noise from the bright\nport, but either by seismi noise or thermal noise. The lasers\nwhi h furnish the light for interferometers of the next generation are supposed to have a onsiderably lower amount of\nrelative te hni al noise. Therefore, in reasing the mass of the\nbeamsplitter by a modest fa tor might already be suf\u0002 ient in\norder to make the bright port \u0003u tuations negligible for the\nGEO 600 topology. Also strategies whi h yield an in rease of\nthe sensitivity at high frequen ies [10\u2104 are not in\u0003uen ed by\nour results.\nThere is another generi me hanism existing by whi h a\nbright-port dark-port oupling is built up. If the transfer fun tion of the two arms are not equal, then the input-output relation ontains the following ontribution from the bright port\n\u014d = IO(\u012b, n\u0304, \u0113) +\n\n\u03c1\u03c4 (N \u2212 E)\n* w\u0304\n1 \u2212 (\u03c12 N + \u03c4 2 E) * W\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03c4 denote the amplitude re\u0003e tivity and transmissivity of the beamsplitter. There are different reasons why the\ntwo arms are not des ribed by the same transfer fun tion. One\nreason ould be that one arm is detuned intentionally in order\nto transmit some arrier light towards the dete tor where it\nserves as lo al os illator for a homodyne measurement of the\nsignal. For a small detuning of just one arm, the arrier light is\ntransmitted into the phase quadrature of \u014d governed by a transfer fun tion whi h is proportional to the detuning. If the arrier light is to be transmitted into the amplitude quadrature of\n\n[1\u2104\n[2\u2104\n[3\u2104\n[4\u2104\n[5\u2104\n[6\u2104\n[7\u2104\n[8\u2104\n[9\u2104\n[10\u2104\n[11\u2104\n\nB.

In\n\nthat ase, the west port has to be detuned a ordingly to maintain the power-re y ling ondition (whi h annot hold exa tly\nhere, sin e the two arms are detuned relative to ea h other).\nAn unintentional reason for different transfer fun tions of the\ntwo arms ould be that the transmissivity and the re\u0003e tivity\nof the beamsplitter are not the same. Then, radiation-pressure\n\u0003u tuations in the two arms would be different by virtue of\nthe different powers of the two respe tive arrier \u0002elds. Carrier light is then transmitted into the phase quadrature of \u014d\nand the orresponding transfer fun tion is proportional to the\ndifferen e of the power re\u0003e tivity and transmissivity of the\nbeamsplitter. There would also be a small loss of the opti al\nsignal due to a partial transmission into the bright port whi h\nis proportional to the same differen e of power re\u0003e tivity and\ntransmissivity.\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Y.
