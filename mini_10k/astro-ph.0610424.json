Most of these baryons are observed at redshifts greater than two, but have remained elusive at\nlower redshifts. Hydrodynamic simulations predict that the low redshift baryons are predominately in\na warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which should exhibit absorption and emission lines in the\nsoft X-ray region. The WHIM is predicted to be most dense around clusters of galaxies. We present\nour XMM-Newton RGS observations of X Comae, an AGN behind the Coma cluster. We detect\nabsorption by Ne IX and O VIII at the redshift of Coma with an equivalent width of 3.3 \u00b1 1.8 eV and\n1.7 \u00b1 1.3 eV respectively (90% confidence errors or 2.3 \u03c3 and 1.9 \u03c3 confidence detections determined\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations). The combined significance of both lines is 3.0 \u03c3, again determined\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations. The same observation yields a high statistics EPIC spectrum of\nthe Coma cluster gas at the position of X Comae. We detect emission by Ne IX with a flux of\n2.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 (90% confidence errors or 3.4 \u03c3 confidence detection).\nThese data permit a number of diagnostics to determine the properties of the material causing the\nabsorption and producing the emission. Although a wide range of properties is permitted, values near\nthe midpoint of the range are temperature \u223c 4 \u00d7 106 K, density \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm\u22123 corresponding to an\noverdensity with respect to the mean of \u223c 32, line of sight path length through it \u223c 41 (Z/Z\u2299 )\u22121 Mpc\nwhere (Z/Z\u2299 ) is the neon metallicity relative to solar. All of these properties are what has been\npredicted of the WHIM, so we conclude that we have detected the WHIM associated with the Coma\ncluster.\nSubject headings: galaxies: clusters: individual: Coma - intergalactic medium - quasars: absorption\nlines - large-scale structure of universe\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOur current understanding of the state of cluster gas\n(e.g. Voit 2004; Borgani et al. 2005) requires some combination of preheating and radiative cooling of the ambient gas, which is then further heated by the accretion shock as the gas falls into the cluster along with\nadditional cooling and nongravitational heating afterwards. However our direct observational knowledge of\nthe state of the gas before it is accreted onto the cluster is limited. Star formation, AGN activity and accretion shocks onto large-scale structures are all possible\nfor the energy source of the preheating (see reviews in\ne.g. Borgani et al. 2002; Dos Santos & Dor\u00e9 2002). Further, the material that will later become the cluster gas is\nthought to be related to the low redshift missing baryons,\nmost of which is suggested from recent numerical simulations (e.g., Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001) to\nreside in a warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) with\ntemperatures of 105 \u2013107 K. Therefore, detecting warmhot gas around clusters of galaxies is crucial to understand their formation as well as to settle the missing\nbaryon problem.\nThe soft X-ray excess above the harder intracluster medium (ICM) emission reported for some clusters\n1 Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), Japan\nAerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), 3-1-1 Yoshinodai, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, 229-8510, Japan; takei@astro.isas.jaxa.jp\n2 Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, 2680 Woodlawn\nDrive, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA\n3 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr extraterrestrische Physik, Giessenbachsrasse, 85748 Garching, Germany\n\n(Lieu et al. 1996; Bowyer et al. 1999; Bonamente et al.\n2002; Finoguenov et al. 2003; Kaastra et al. 2003) may\nbe signaling a fortunate orientation of a filament\ncontaining WHIM at those clusters. In particular,\nFinoguenov et al. (2003) determined the WHIM density,\ntemperature and abundance of heavy elements, assuming\nthe soft excess in the EPIC spectra of the Coma cluster\noutskirts is due to a filament extending \u223c20 Mpc along\nthe line of sight, corresponding to the excess galaxies in\nfront of Coma. The conclusions are, however, strongly\ndependent on that assumption.\nAn additional uncertainty common to all studies of low\nredshift cluster soft excess is the presence of emission\nlines in the Milky Way and even interplanetary foreground (McCammon et al. 2002; Wargelin et al. 2004;\nSnowden et al. 2004) that are not easily separable from\ncluster emission given the spectral resolution of a CCD.\nSo a confirmation of cosmological origin of the soft components in clusters is required.\nA direct way to confirm the existence of the warm-hot\ngas in cluster outskirts is to detect absorption lines in Xray spectra of background quasars with a high resolution\ngrating spectrometer. The spectral resolution of these\ninstruments is sufficient to separate absorption by cluster WHIM from that of foreground contamination due\nto the interstellar medium in our Galaxy or the interplanetary medium of our Solar System (Futamoto et al.\n2004; Yao & Wang 2005). Given the expected temperatures of this gas and the cosmic abundances of the elements, the strongest lines should be the resonance lines\nof hydrogen-like and helium-like oxygen and neon.

(2003). The coordinate grid is RA, Dec\n(J2000.0).\n\ntional information is available by combining absorption\nand emission measurements, particularly from the same\nion. We can measure the density of the gas, as well as\nconstraining the geometry of the emitting zone directly\n(Krolik & Raymond 1988; Sarazin 1989).\nHowever desirable these measurements are, they are\nat the limit of current instrumentation (Kravtsov et al.\n2002; Viel et al. 2003) and detecting the WHIM will only\nbe possible in special circumstances. The simulations\nmentioned previously indicate that the WHIM near clusters of galaxies should be denser than average. Therefore,\nwe expect a higher absorption signal from it compared to\nthat along random sight lines. One example is a marginal\ndetection of O VIII absorption line by Fujimoto et al.\n(2004) toward the Virgo cluster. It is possible to detect\nthe average density WHIM in the X-ray spectra of extraordinarily bright background sources such as blazars,\nparticularly when they are in outburst, (Nicastro et al.\n2002; Fang et al. 2002; Mathur et al. 2003; Fang et al.\n2003; Rasmussen et al. 2003; McKernan et al. 2004;\nNicastro et al. 2005). However, even the most convincing detection (Nicastro et al. 2005) is controversial\n(Rasmussen et al. 2006; Kaastra et al. 2006). The best\ncase of a bright blazar behind a cluster is so far unknown.\nConsequently, there is still no firm X-ray detection of absorption due to the WHIM.\nIn this paper we present our XMM-Newton RGS observations of the Seyfert 1 AGN X Comae, which is located\nbehind the Coma cluster to the north but well inside the\ncluster virial radius. We also describe the EPIC spectra\nof the Coma cluster gas at the position of X Comae that\nwere obtained simultaneously. We assume a Hubble constant of 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 or h70 = 1 and \u03a9m0 = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7. Unless otherwise stated, errors in the figures are at the 68 % confidence level and at the 90 %\nconfidence level in the text and tables.\n2.

At a redshift of 0.091\u00b10.001 (Branduardi-Raymont et al. 1985),\nX Comae is the brightest X-ray object behind the Coma\ncluster. Its position is (13h 00m 22s .17, +28\u25e6 24\u2032 2\u2032\u2032 .6)\n\u22121\n(J2000.0). As shown in Figure 1, it is 28.4\u2032 or 0.79h70\nMpc or 0.33r200 north of the cluster center, defined to be\nat NGC 4874.\nWe made five observations with XMM-Newton\n(Jansen et al. 2001) in 2004 and 2005 for a total of 451.8\nks. The instrument mode and the filter used are shown\nin Table 1, and the gross and net exposure times and flux\nof X Comae are summarized in Table 2. X Comae had\na flux at or below its hitherto historical low during our\nobservations.\n3. ABSORPTION LINES IN THE RGS SPECTRA\n\nWe reduced the RGS (den Herder et al. 2001) data using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS)\nversion 6.1.0, with standard parameters. We checked the\ndata from a source-free region of CCD 9 for background\nflares. The regions were CHIPX = 2 to 341, CHIPY =\n2 to 38 and 87 to 127 for RGS1 and CHIPX = 2 to 284,\nCHIPY = 2 to 37 and 87 to 127 for RGS2. We accumulated the signal photons only when the count rates\nin these regions were less than 0.1 s\u22121 (in PI range 80 3000) for both RGS1 and 2. This rather severe threshold\nwas determined empirically to yield the highest signal to\nnoise background subtracted source spectrum. The net\nexposure time was about 60 % of the total exposure and\nis summarized in Table 2.\nThe spectra were extracted after merging the five data\nsets and then binned by a factor of four, resulting in a\nfinal bin width of 0.035 \u00c5 at 11.5 \u00c5 and 0.046 \u00c5 at 23 \u00c5.\nThese bin width are about half of the average FWHM\nwavelength resolution of the RGS (0.067 \u00c5). The redshift widths corresponding to the resolution are 0.0058\n\n\fWHIM associated with the Coma Cluster\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.- (upper panel) RGS spectra around the Ne and O K\u03b1 lines.

The background spectra were similarly produced from the same\ndata sets using the pixels outside the region where source\nphotons were dispersed. The background spectra were\nthen scaled to account for the different areas used to extract source and background photons. Since the number\nof photons is small, we used the C-statistic (maximumlikelihood) method for model fitting. Rasmussen et al.\n(2006) pointed out that merging different observations\nmay introduce artificial absorption features in RGS spectra. However, their suggested features have about one\norder of magnitude smaller equivalent widths than those\nwe discuss below. They are smaller than our statistical\nerrors. We tried the procedure to search for bad columns\nthat may cause artificial absorptions according to their\nAppendix C. It showed no apparent artificial features\nwithin our statistics.\n\nTABLE 3\nResults of fitting the RGS spectra of X comae with\nbroken power law models\nComponent\n\nUnit\n\nValue\n\nNH\nSource \u0393a (E < 0.75 keV)\nSource \u0393a (E > 0.75 keV)\nSource Normalizationb\nBackground \u0393a (E < 0.75 keV)\nBackground \u0393a (E > 0.75 keV)\nBackground Normalizationb\nC-statistic\nfree parameters\nd.o.f.\n\ncm\u22122\n\n9.3 \u00d7 1019 (fixed)\n1.74+0.15\n\u22120.29\n2.41 \u00b1 0.25\n\u22124\n(6.88+0.72\n\u22120.66 ) \u00d7 10\n3.73+0.18\n\u22120.12\n1.96 \u00b1 0.23\n(0.79 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10\u22124\n708.63\n6\n628\n\na\nb\n\nphoton index\nin units of photons keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 1 keV\n\n3.1.

The background model is a\ndifferent broken power law without Galactic absorption.\n\nIn order to determine the continuum model, we fitted\nthe source plus background and background spectra of\nRGS1 and 2 simultaneously using XSPEC version 11.3\nin the wavelength region 11.5 \u00c5\u201322.7 \u00c5. Regions around\nthe Ne IX, Ne X, O VII and O VIII K\u03b1 lines, which are\ndefined as zcoma \u2212 3 \u03c3gal < z < zcoma + 3 \u03c3gal , were\nexcluded from the fit.\nThe best fit model and parameters are shown in Figure 2 and in Table 3 respectively. The Ratios around\nNe IX, Ne X, O VII and O VIII lines vs. z are shown in\nFigure 3. The FWHM wavelength resolution of RGS is\nalso shown as a horizontal line. We summed the RGS1\nand 2 data where both were available. Since the mapping\nfrom wavelength to redshift is a function of wavelength,\nwe interpolated the counts to a common redshift bin size\nfor all four lines.\nThe three vertical dashed lines in Figure 3 indicate\nzcoma and zcoma \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 \u03c3gal.

When the absorption\nredshift region was defined, we fixed its center to the\napriori known zcoma and chose its width to maximize the\nNe IX plus O VIII signal from among 2, 4, 6 or 8 binned-\n\nby-four pixels; i.e., the region was determined after a\nfour-trial optimization.\nNe IX is the ion with the deepest absorption, and\nO VIII is the second deepest. The absorption ratio is\nbelow 1 for the Ne X and O VII lines as well, though\nthey are not very significant. The continuum is always\nconsistent with 1. This situation of strong Ne IX absorption and weak absorption by the other three lines is\noften observed at much higher signal to noise in interstellar medium features in the spectra of galactic X-ray\nsources (e.g. Yao & Wang 2005).\nTo improve the signal-to-noise, we made a grand errorweighted average of the ratios for Ne IX and O VIII lines\nand calculated the combined significance. The result is\nshown in Figure 4 where the band around unity is +0.7%,\n\u22121.0%, the 1\u03c3 error of the model normalization with\npower law indices fixed at their best fit values.

We used fos = 0.724 for the Ne IX, fos = 0.696\nfor O VII, and fos = 0.416 for Ne X and O VIII\n(Verner et al. 1996). The column densities of the four\nlines are then NNeIX = 4.3 \u00b1 2.3 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 , NNeX =\n1.9 (< 8.8)\u00d71016 cm\u22122 , NOVII = 0.9 (< 3.5)\u00d71016 cm\u22122\nand NOVIII = 3.7 \u00b1 2.8 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 .\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\nF\n\nhigh (20\u201330 counts/bin), we investigated the significance\nof the absorption using Monte Carlo simulations. We\nmade 1000 simulated spectra with no absorption which\nhave the same statistics and the same response function\nas the actual data, and then calculated the ratios with\nthe same procedure as above. That is, we calculted the\nratio for Ne IX, Ne X, O VII and O VIII lines and grand\nerror-weighted average of the ratios of Ne IX and O VIII.\nThis calculation was done for 2, 4, 6 and 8 binned-byfour pixels around zcoma , and then we chose the most\nsignificant grand average among the four trials. The significance of the absorption in our observed RGS data can\nbe estimated as the probability that the simultated spectra without absorption yield a smaller discrepancy from\nunity. The significance for the grand error-weighted average was 99.7%. We conclude that we have detected\nabsorption by material associated with the Coma cluster\nwith a significance of 99.7%. This significance is equivalent to 3.0\u03c3 of a Gaussian distribution. The significance\nof Ne IX and O VIII was 98.0% (2.3\u03c3) and 94.1% (1.9\u03c3),\nrespectively.\nThe equivalent width EW of the absorption lines can\nbe calculated from the ratios as (1 \u2212 Ratio) \u00d7 \u2206E, where\n\u2206E is the energy corresponding to the width of 6 bins\nwe used to calculate the ratios. The EW s for the four\nlines are also shown in Table 4.

These also correspond to 1\u03c3, 1.6\u03c3,\n2\u03c3 and 2.6\u03c3, respectively if the data were Gaussian distributed.\n\nFig. 6.- Ratios of the data to the continuum model vsesus z\nfor Ne IX (the same data as the top panel of Figure 3), overlaid\nwith boxcar absorption models. Red line shows the best-fit model,\nwhile green line displays (F , Wnotch ) = (1.0, 3.1\u00d710\u22123 ). Since the\nwavelength resolution of the RGS is comparable to the width of the\nabsorptiion, the fit is not sensitive to F or Wnotch individually, but\nto the EW , which is proportional to F \u00d7 Wnotch . Vertical dashed\nlines indicate zcoma and zcoma \u00b1 2.5 \u00d7 \u03c3gal .\n\n3.2. Fitting the absorption features and their equivalent\n\nwidths\nNext we derived the equivalent widths of the four lines\nby another way: using model-fitting of the spectra. We\nadopted the same contimuum model as that in \u00a7 3.1,\nand a boxcar profile to describe the absorption (NOTCH\nmodel in XSPEC). This absorption model multiplies the\ncontinuum by a factor of\n\u001a\n(1 \u2212 F )\n1\n\nfor (\u03bbnotch \u2212\nfor all other,\n\nWnotch\n)\n2\n\n< \u03bb < (\u03bbnotch +\n\nWnotch\n)\n2\n\n(4)\nwhere \u03bbnotch , Wnotch and F are the central wavelength,\nwidth and absorption factor, respectively. The equivalent width is given by EW = Wnotch \u00d7F . We fixed \u03bbnotch\nto be the value corresponding the redshift of the Coma\ncluster. Since the significances of the absorption features\nwere low, except for Ne IX, we fitted the Ne IX absorption first and then fitted the other lines with Wnotch fixed\nto the best fit Ne IX value (in z, not wavelength). All together the free parameters were: power law indices and\n\nnormalizations of the source and background continua,\nWnotch and F for Ne IX absorption, and F for the other\nspecies. Data between 11.5\u201322.7 \u00c5 were used in the fit.\nThe best fit parameters are shown in Table 5, where\n\u03bbnotch and Wnotch are converted to redshift. The equivalent widths and their errors were determined taking\ninto account the covariance between Wnotch and F , as\nis shown in Figure 5 for Ne IX. Figure 5 indicates that\nthis analysis is not sensitive to F or Wnotch because the\nwavelength resolution of RGS is comparable to the width\nof the absorption. Figure 6 compares the best-fit (red)\nboxcar absorption model and the model with F = 1.0\nand Wnotch = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 (green). There is little difference between them. Note that we can estimate the EW ,\nthe product of F and Wnotch , more precisely than either\nF or Wnotch . From this figure, the equivalent width of\nNe IX is estimated to be 3.7+2.0\n\u22122.2 eV (90% confidence errors). Best fit values and 2\u03c3 upper limits are also given\nin Table 5 for the Ne X, O VII and O VIII absorption\n\n\f6\n\nY.

The column density Nion of each ion, estimated\nfrom the EW are tabulated in Table 5 as well. The derived equivalent widths are consistent within the errors\nwith those obtained from the ratio of the data to the\ncontinuum model described in \u00a7 3.1.\nThe significance of the line was again calculated using\nMonte Carlo simulations. The C-statistic was improved\nby 7.57 when we added the Ne IX absorption line. The\nprobability that the simulated data shows less improvement of the C-statistic was 99.2%, equivalent to 2.7\u03c3 if\nthe data were Gaussian distributed (compared to 98.0%\nfrom the ratio method). We took this value as the significance of Ne IX line with boxcar-fitting. In the case\nof boxcar-fitting, the O VIII line is less significant than\nthat found with the ratio method (82.4% compared to\n\n94.1%) and hence combining Ne IX and O VIII absorption did not improve the significance (98.5%) compared\nto that of Ne IX alone. The significances obtained with\nboxcar-fitting were slightly different from those by the\nratio method, particularly for O VIII. This is probably\nbecause the two methods are not exactly identical: with\nboxcar-fitting the detector response is convolved with\nan assumed absorption shape (boxcar) that is same for\nthe four lines, while no shape was assumed for the ratio\nmethod.\n4.

We considered the entire\nX Comae field, as well as dividing it into five concentric\nsectors of annuli, approximately centered on the center\nof the cluster.\nDetermining a reliable background is crucial for this\nwork because the temperatures of the WHIM and the\nMilky Way interstellar medium are similar and the soft\nemission in the X Comae field is not very bright. Many\nprevious attempts to measure the soft emission from the\nComa cluster (e.g. Finoguenov et al. 2003; Kaastra et al.\n2003) used ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) data to obtain the values of the components of a galactic background model. The resulting background subtraction\nis only as good as the model. Since then there have\nbeen several XMM-Newton observations serendipitously\nlocated around the Coma cluster, as we show in Figure 7.\nThose observations provide a true background measured\n\nwith the same instrument as our data and are therefore\npreferable for our analysis. We have examined the RASS\ndata at the location of these fields to determine whether\nthey are representative of the general background around\nthe Coma cluster. One of them, HD111812 (ObsID\n0008220201), was located on an unusually bright spot of\nthe RASS maps and has been omitted from the analysis.\nSome properties of the four remaining fields are shown\nin Table 6.\nWe performed the following analysis on these ten fields.\nWe excised point sources including X Comae. We also\nexcised diffuse sources using a wavelet-based detection\nalgorithm, which were on a spatial scale of 4\u2032\u2032 to 4\u2032 and\nhad a surface brightness comparable to that of the cluster\nemission. We extracted a spectrum from each of the ten\nfields and subtracted a filter wheel closed accumulation\nfrom each. We determined the vignetting correction as-\n\n\f8\n\nY.

The centers of the lower-energy Gaussians are fixed to O VII and O VIII at zero redshift and that of\nthe higher-energy Gaussian is fixed to Ne IX at the Coma redshift.\n\nFig. 9.- Surface brightness of O VII and O VIII (crosses (+)\nand triangles (\u25b3), divided by ten) and Ne IX (circles (\u25e6)) versus\ndistance from NGC 4874, which we take as the center of the Coma\ncluster.\n\nsuming a uniform source surface brightness in each field.\nWe fitted the net vignetting corrected spectrum with a\ncollisionally ionized thermal plasma model component\n(APEC in XSPEC) for the Coma hot gas, (except for\nthe two background fields most distant from the Coma\ncenter), plus an APEC component for the Milky Way\nbackground, plus a power law component for the cosmic X-ray background. The free and fixed parameters of\nthe models are given in Table 7. The energy range for\nthe spectral fit was 0.4-7.0 keV, excluding the energies\nof strong detector lines (1.4\u20131.6 keV). We used the improved response matrix from the SAS v6.5 calibration release. Our key finding is a clear detection of O VII, O VIII\nand Ne IX lines in excess of the continuum for the entire\nX Comae field, as shown in Figure 8. Although there\nstill remain small residuals at 0.97 keV, which might be\nidentified as Fe XX L line complex, the statistical significance of this feature is not high and hence we will not\n\ndiscuss it further.\nWe then fitted narrow Gaussians at the energies of the\nO VII, O VIII and Ne IX lines. The results are in Figure\n8 and Table 7 for the entire X Comae field and Figure 9 and Table 6 for the other fields. The intensity of\nthe Ne IX component increases towards the Coma cluster center (see Figure 9) and its intensity in the sector\nnearest the position of X Comae is above that of the\nbackground fields. The Coma intracluster medium is too\nhot to produce this line. We can also rule out a solar\nwind origin, as no variation with respect to the center of\nthe Coma cluster in a single pointing is expected for that\nscenario. We thus conclude that we have detected Ne IX\nline emission from Coma cluster material that is cooler\nthan most of the Coma intracluster medium.\nThe intensity of the O VII and O VIII Gaussian components did not vary in an obvious way as a function of\nposition (see Figure 9). The two oxygen lines show no enhancement at the position of the cluster: their intensity\nin the five X Comae sectors is the same or even lower than\nthat in the background fields. We thus conclude that all\nof the oxygen emission comes from the Milky Way soft\nbackground and not from material in the Coma cluster.\nThe intensity of O VII and O VIII lines has a large\nscatter from one background field to another. The intensity in one of them (the 1253+275 field) is consistent with the soft X-ray background measured by\nMcCammon et al. (2002) (they obtained 40.6 \u00b1 10.9 and\n13.5 \u00b1 5.4 \u00d710\u22128 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 , for O VII and\nO VIII, respectively), while the intensity in the other\nfields are larger than their values. On the other hand,\nthe scatter of the Ne IX intensity among the background fields is not as large and the average is consistent with the upper limit of McCammon et al. (2002).\n(< 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 , from their Figure 13).\nDo we expect not to be able to detect Coma cluster\noxygen emission given the strength of the cluster neon\nline? The O VII surface brightness is 1.67 times that of\nNe IX, for a temperature of 4 \u00d7 106 K and a Ne/O number density ratio of 0.14 (see \u00a7 5.1.1 for a justification of\nthese values). This expected O VII line intensity in the\nentire X Comae field is approximately the dispersion of\nthe other nine measurements (10.0 versus 8.0 \u00d710\u22128 ph\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 , respectively). Thus the different behavior of the neon and oxygen emission lines is probably\ndue to the much lower galactic neon background intensity that allows the Coma neon emission to be detected.\nThe higher galactic oxygen background intensity masks\nthe Coma oxygen emission in the X Comae fields.\nIn the next section we will need the net Ne IX intensity\nat the position of X Comae. Of course this measurement\nrequires an extrapolation to that position since the glare\nfrom the AGN prevents measurement of emission from\nthe Coma cluster gas. We give in Table 6 the numerical\nand error-weighted average of all four background fields\nand the three fields excluding Coma 0. The numerical\naverage is more appropriate if there are real variations\nfrom field to field. Excluding Coma 0 is appropriate if\nit has a higher intensity. Since none of the four averages\nare statistically distinguishable, we take for the Ne IX\nbackground the weighted average of all background fields\nsince it has the lowest error. Similarly we take for the\ngross intensity the value from the entire X Comae field,\n\n\fWHIM associated with the Coma Cluster\n\n9\n\nTABLE 7\nResults of fitting the EPIC pn spectrum of\ndiffuse gas at the position of X Comaea\nComponent\n\nUnit\n\nValue\n\nGalactic absorption\nNH\ncm\u22122 8.0 \u00d7 1019 (fixed)\nComa hot ICM\nkT\nkeV\n3.75+0.32\n\u22120.50\nAbundance\nsolar\n0.47 \u00b1 0.09\nz\n0.0231 (fixed)\n\u22126\nNormalizationb\n7.77+0.70\n\u22120.85 \u00d7 10\nMilky Way warm ISM\nkT\nkeV\n0.174+0.002\n\u22120.001\nAbundance\nsolar\n0, 1 (fixed)c\nz\n0 (fixed)\nNormalizationb\n5.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22126\nCosmic X-ray Background\n\u0393\n1.40 (fixed)\n\u22124\nNormalizationd\n4.05+0.23\n\u22120.18 \u00d7 10\nO VII emission line\nE\nkeV\n0.574 (fixed)\n\u22128\nIe\n55.6+2.1\n\u22121.8 \u00d7 10\nO VIII emission line\nE\nkeV\n0.654 (fixed)\n\u22128\nIe\n15.4+1.3\n\u22121.4 \u00d7 10\nNe IX emission line\nE\n0.901 (fixed)\nIe\n6.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 10\u22128\nChi-squared\n1305.15\nFree parameters\n9\nDegrees of freedom\n1272\na\n\nEntire\nX Comae field (456.9 arcmin2 )\nR\nne nH dV /4\u03c0(DA (1 + z))2 per solid angle in\nunits of 1014 cm\u22125 arcmin\u22122 , where DA is the\nangular size distance to the source, ne is the electron density, nH is the hydrogen density and V is\nthe volume.\nc Abundance of He, C, Fe, and Ni is fixed to 1.0,\nwhile that of all other elements, including O and\nNe, is fixed to 0.0\nd\nIn units of photons keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121\narcmin\u22122 at 1 keV\ne In units of photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcmin\u22122\nb\n\nsince it is statistically indistinguishable from the sector\nclosest to X Comae but has a lower error.

Such a low intensity may\nmean that its measurement is subject to systematic errors in the continuum. We therefore repeated the entire\npreceding analysis with six additional continuum models\nthat froze or thawed different components and/or added\na soft proton component that was not folded through the\nmirror area. The dispersion in the seven measurement of\nthe net Ne IX intensity was less than the above statistical\nerror. We conclude that the statistical error accurately\nreflects the uncertainties of the measurement.\n5. DISCUSSION\n5.1. Properties of the warm-hot gas\n\nWe have detected absorption features in the RGS spectra of X Comae at the redshift of the Coma cluster with\na combined confidence of 99.7% (equivalent to 3.0\u03c3 of a\nGaussian distribution) and line emission features in the\n\nFig. 10.- The ratio of the theoretically expected EW s of Ne X,\nO VII or O VIII to Ne IX divided by the observed upper limits to\nthat ratio. The dotted line shows NeX, while the dashed lines show\nthe larger value for OVII or OVIII. Since the theoretical OVII or\nOVIII to NeIX EW ratios depend on the number density ratio of\nNe/O, we indicate three cases: 0.14 as the canonical value, 0.41 as\nthe highest one found from literature, and 0.82 as the extremely\nhigh Ne/O case. The allowed temperature is the range in which\nboth NeIX and O curves are below 1. There is no allowed temperature range for Ne/O = 0.14, while it is 2.0\u00d7106 K < T < 5.8\u00d7106 K\nfor the extremely high Ne/O case. The ionization fraction given in\nTable 2 and 3 of Chen et al. (2003) for collisional ionization case\nwas assumed.\n\nEPIC pn spectra of diffuse gas at the position of X Comae\nat the 3.4\u03c3 confidence level. Although the significance of\neither one is not very high, the fact that we observed\nboth absorption and emission from Ne IX at the Coma\ncluster redshift or position is additional support for the\ndetection of this ion. In this section we give the properties of the warm-hot gas that can be deduced from our\nobservations under the assumption that the absorbing\nand emitting materials are the same and that material is\nuniformly distributed in a single phase in collisional ionization equilibrium. Although these assumptions have\nthe virtue that they are simple and are consistent with\nthe observations, it is entirely possible, even likely, that\nthe actual situation is more complicated. In this case\nthe properties we derive will be typical of the dominant\nphase of the material.\n5.1.1. Temperature and Ne/O number density ratio\n\nWe can constrain the temperature of a plasma in ionization equilibrium from the ratios of absorption EW s\nbetween different ionization states of the same species.\nOn the other hand, we can constrain the number density\n(or abundance) ratio of different elements from the ratio\nof absorption EW s between lines of different species.\nFirst, we investigate the allowed temperature and\nabundance for the boxcar-fitting case. Figure 10 plots\nthe ratio of the theoretically expected EW s of Ne X,\nO VII or O VIII to Ne IX divided by the observed upper\nlimits to that ratio. That is, it plots a ratio of ratios. The\nexpected values were calculated using the ionization fractions of a plasma under collisional ionization equilibrium\ngiven in Figures 2 and 3 of Chen et al. (2003). In this calculation we assumed EW \u221d Nion fos , i.e. no saturation.\nThe dotted line shows Ne X, while the dashed lines show\nthe larger value for O VII or O VIII. The allowed temperature is the range for which both the Ne IX and O curves\n\n\f10\n\nY.

(2003) in the collisional\nionization equilibrium case. Solid and dashed curves correspond to OVII/OVIII and NeX/NeIX, respectively. The horizontal lines represent\nthe upper limits determined by this work. The allowed temperature is that for which the curved lines are below the horizontal upper limit\nlines of the same style, i.e., T > 2.2 \u00d7 106 K for OVII/OVIII and T < 5.7 \u00d7 106 K for NeX/NeIX. (right) Ne/O number density ratio as\na function of temperature T . The three curves correspond to the best-fit values and \u00b11\u03c3 errors, respectively, obtained from the observed\nNe IX/O VIII ratio.\n\nare below 1. The upper limit of Ne X/Ne IX ratio gives a\nrobust upper limit of the temperature, T < 5.8 \u00d7 106 K.\nThe theoretical O VII or O VIII to Ne IX EW ratios\ndepend on the number density ratio of Ne/O, while Ne/O\nratio is not well known even for solar or interstellar values. The widely-used solar Ne/O number density ratio\nis 0.14 (Anders & Grevesse 1989). However it is difficult\nto measure the abundance of Ne due to its absence in\nthe solar photospheric spectrum or in meteorites. Further, the O abundance also contains uncertainties; improved modeling of solar photosphere lines has yielded\nlower abundances for some elements including O and\nNe (Asplund et al. 2005). Recent measurements using coronal X-ray or quiet Sun EUV lines find Ne/O\n< 0.30 (95% confidence) or 0.17\u00b10.05 (estimated systematic errors) respectively (Schmelz et al. 2005; Young\n2005). A higher Ne/O ratio, 0.41, was suggested by\nX-ray spectroscopy of mostly giant stars and multiple\nsystems (Drake & Testa 2005). Recent measurements of\nsightlines to 4U1820-303 and LMC X-3 through the interstellar medium yield 0.20+0.10\n\u22120.07 (90% confidence) and\n>0.14 (95% confidence) respectively (Yao & Wang 2006;\nWang et al. 2005). Thus the situation is not yet clear\nwith reported values ranging from 0.14 to 0.41.\nSince our boxcar-fitting cannot determine the Ne/O\nratio, we indicate three cases in Figure 10: 0.14 as the\ncanonical value, 0.41 as the highest one found in the\nliterature, and 0.82 as an extremely high Ne/O case.\nWe found that Ne/O > 0.25 (2\u03c3) is necessary in order to reproduce the boxcar-fit results with an assumption of single temperature plasma; for example, there\nis no intersection of O curve and 1 for Ne/O = 0.14.\nThus, the canonical Ne/O ratio (Ne/O = 0.14) is rejected in this analysis. On the other hand, if Ne/O was\nlarger than 0.25, there was allowed temperature range.\n\nEven if adopting an extremely high Ne/O ratio, Ne/O\n= 0.82, the temperature range can be constrained to be\nT > 2.0 \u00d7 106 K. Combining this constraint with that\nfrom Ne X/Ne IX ratio, we obtained a conservative temperature range, 2.0 \u00d7 106 K < T < 5.8 \u00d7 106 K.\nWe next used the EW s determined with the ratio\nmethod (\u00a7 3.1). This method is independent of the intrinsic shape of the absorption. The left panel of Figure 11 shows the theoretical equivalent width ratios of\nO VII/O VIII and Ne X/Ne IX as a function of temperature T again based on Figures 2 and 3 of Chen et al.\n(2003) in the case of collisional ionization equilibrium.\nNote that here we use the O VII/O VIII ratio because\nO VIII was also detected at more than 90% confidence\nwith the ratio method. We show the observed 2\u03c3 upper\nlimits obtained in \u00a7 3.1 with horizontal lines in the left\npanel of Figure 11. The allowed temperature range is\nthat for which the curved lines are below the horizontal upper limits of that ratio, i.e., T > 2.2 \u00d7 106 K for\nO VII/O VIII and T < 5.7 \u00d7 106 K for Ne IX/Ne X. Combining these two constraints, we restricted the temperature of the plasma to be 2.2 \u00d7 106 K < T < 5.7 \u00d7 106 K\nat the 2\u03c3 confidence level.\nFrom the Ne IX/O VIII ratio, we can investigate the\nallowed Ne/O number density ratio as a function of temperature T . This is shown in the right panel of Figure 11.\nThe \u00b11\u03c3 error range is also shown. The allowed Ne/O\nratio is not very sensitive to temperature; it is roughly\n0.3 \u00b1 0.15 to 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 within the allowed temperature\nrange found above. Although our best-fit Ne/O ratio\nsuggests a Ne overabundance, all of the above including\nthe canonical value of 0.14 is within our \u223c 1\u03c3 confidence\nlimit. Note that both temperature range and Ne/O ratio are consistent in the two estimates (boxcar fitting and\nratio values).\n\n\fWHIM associated with the Coma Cluster\n\n11\n\nNe IX emission C comes from six lines: Ne IX resonance line (13.44 \u00c5), three satellite lines of Ne VIII\n(13.44 \u00c5, 13.46 \u00c5 and 13.55 \u00c5), Ne IX intercombination\nline (13.55 \u00c5) and Ne IX forbidden line (13.70 \u00c5).\nWe derive the parameters of the material producing\nthe Ne IX absorption and emission as a function of temperature from its column density and intensity at the\nposition of X Comae found at the ends of Sections 3.2\nand 4, respectively. For example, a temperature of\n4.0 \u00d7 106 K gives C = 5.37 \u00d7 10\u221213 photons cm3 s\u22121 sr\u22121\nand fion = 0.50.

Vertical dotted lines indicate allowed\ntemperature range, 2.0 \u00d7 106 K < T < 5.8 \u00d7 106 K (see Figure 11).\n\n5.1.2. Density, line of sight length and metallicity\n\nWe can constrain the average hydrogen density nH of\nthe warm-hot gas and its path length L along the line of\nsight by combining absorption and emission observations\nof the same ion, Ne IX in our case. The column density\nof an ion is\nNion = fion ZnH L\n(5)\nwhere Z is the abundance of the element relative to hydrogen. Equation (2) gives Nion as a function of the observed EW . The surface brightness of an emission line I\nis\nC\nZn2H L\n(6)\nI=\n(1 + z)3\nwhere the exponent of (1 + z) is three instead of four\nbecause we measure surface brightness in photons, not\nergs, and C is a coefficient depending on temperature\nbut not on the elemental abundance. Solving these two\nequations simultaneously gives\nnH =\n\nfion (1 + z)3 I\nC\nNion\n\n(7)\n\nZL =\n\n2\nNion\nC\n2 (1 + z)3 I\nfion\n\n(8)\n\nand\n.\n\nThe coefficient C is\n\u0012 \u00132\nne\n1 X Pj\u2032\n1\n.\nC=\n4\u03c0 nH\nZ(M ) j Ej\n\n(9)\n\nHere ne /nH = 1.17, Z(M ) is the abundance of the element assumed by Mewe et al. (1985) (8.32 \u00d7 10\u22125 for\nneon), P \u2032 is tabulated in Table IV of Mewe et al. (1985),\nE is the energy of the line and the sum is over all\nlines not resolved with CCD energy resolution. For the\n\n\u0012\n\nwhere Z\u2299 = 1.23 \u00d7 10\u22124 is the solar abundance of Ne\nrelative to H (Anders & Grevesse 1989). The derived values of nH and ZL depend strongly on the temperature.\nWe show in Figure 12 the values as a function of temperature, where solid and dashed curves represent bestfit values and 1\u03c3 confidence regions, respectively. Vertical dotted lines indicate the allowed temperature range,\n2.0 \u00d7 106 K < T < 5.8 \u00d7 106 K (see Figure 10). We constrained nH to be 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm\u22123 < nH < 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123\nand ZL to be 1 Z\u2299 Mpc < ZL < 300 Z\u2299 Mpc. These\nlimits are at approximately the 3\u03c3 confidence level since\nthey sum the 2\u03c3 limit on temperature and the 1\u03c3 limit\non nH and ZL (i.e., do not sum the errors in quadrature). The derived hydrogen density corresponds to\n10 < \u03b4 < 400. Here \u03b4 is the overdensity with respect\nto the mean density of the universe: \u03b4 \u2261 nH /n \u0304H with\nn \u0304H = X\u03a9b \u03c1c (1 + z)3 /mH . X = 0.71 is the hydrogento-baryon mass ratio and \u03a9b = 0.0224h\u22122 is the baryon\ndensity relative to the critical density \u03c1c .\nAlthough the constraint we obtained on ZL is\nnot tight, we note that the lower limit on L is >\n1 Mpc (Z/Z\u2299 )\u22121 . The measured value of Z/Z\u2299 at the\nposition of X Comae is 0.16\u00b10.05 (68% confidence error)\nfor iron (De Grandi & Molendi 2001), where Z\u2299 = 4.68\u00d7\n10\u22125 is the solar abundance of iron (Anders & Grevesse\n1989). Thus, the scale of the plasma that contains\nNe IX is at least 2.6 times the size of the Coma cluster\n(r200 = 2.4h\u22121\n70 Mpc) if the Ne and Fe abundances are\napproximately the same. For at least two clusters (2A\n0335+096 and S\u00e9rsic 159\u201303) RGS observations show\nthat the Ne/Fe is approximately unity or slightly less\n(Werner et al. 2006; de Plaa et al. 2006). We conclude\nthat the material containing Ne IX is likely not in the\nComa cluster.\n5.2. Can the Ne IX emission come from material within\n\nthe cluster virial radius?\nWe investigate the suggestion by Cheng et al. (2005)\nthat gas associated with merging sub-groups inside the\ncluster virial region, which preserves its identity for a\nwhile before being destroyed by the hot intracluster\nmedium, is responsible for the cluster soft excess. In particular, we determine whether this material can produce\nthe Ne IX emission we observe. We disregard the constraints from the absorption measurements here. Rather\nwe assume that the temperature of this material is 2\u00d7106\nK, the peak of the Ne IX ion fraction, and that the material is in pressure equilibrium with the ICM. Neither\n\n\f12\n\nY. Takei et al.\n\nof these assumptions is very constraining. Changing the\ntemperature to 4 \u00d7 106 K, the midpoint of the allowed\nrange found previously, changes the results calculated below by less than a factor of two. The second assumption\nyields a density of warm-hot material similar to the densest regions of groups, which we could have assumed at the\noutset since that is the suggestion we are investigating.\nFirst we need the properties of the hot ICM. The\nemission-weighted temperature at the position of X Comae is 7.4 keV from the temperature map of Honda et al.\n(1996). The emission measure-weighted hydrogen den1/2\nsity at the position of X Comae is 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 h70 cm\u22123\n(Briel et al. 1992). Next we need the properties of the\nwarm-hot material. A temperature of 0.172 keV and\npressure equilibrium with the ICM yields a hydrogen\n1/2\ndensity of 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 h70 cm\u22123 , or \u03b4 \u223c 3.4 \u00d7 104 , and\n\u22121/3\nentropy \u223c 4 keV h70\ncm2 . The latter two values\nplace the warm-hot material on the extreme high density tail of the phase plot in Figure 4 of Cheng et al.\n(2005). Equation (8) with C(2 \u00d7 106 K) = 1.19 \u00d7\n10\u221213 photons cm3 s\u22121 sr\u22121 , the above hydrogen density\nand the observed Ne IX surface brightness imply the path\nlength through the material L is \u223c 100 pc. The sound\ncrossing time across L is \u223c 5 \u00d7 105 years, during which\nthe material travels \u223c 600 pc moving at \u03c3gal c. Thus\npressure equilibrium is a good assumption because the\nICM pressure hardly changes over such a small distance.\nHow long can this warm-hot material survive? We assume its size across the line of sight is also L, that is\nthe warm-hot material is tiny blobs of diameter \u223c 100\npc. Following Cowie & McKee (1977), the classical heat\nconduction across the blob-cluster interface is saturated.\nThe saturated evaporation time is \u223c 1 \u00d7 104 years, from\ntheir equation (64). Any blobs that might exist are very\nquickly destroyed. Further they are not replenished since\nthe time for group gas at a temperature of 2 keV and the\nabove density to cool to a temperature at which there is\na significant population of Ne IX is \u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 years.\nEven after the blobs evaporate it takes some additional\ntime for the Ne ion distribution to equilibrate to that appropriate to the new temperature in which the Ne finds\nitself. The longest lived ion capable of emitting the Ne IX\nresonace line we detect is Ne X, which it does by electron\ncapture to an excited level followed by radiative deexcitation. The ionization time \u03c4ion to convert Ne X to Ne XI is\nmostly determined by the collisional ionization efficiency\nSNeX ; i.e., \u03c4ion \u223c 1/ne SNeX . The recombination rate is\nnegligibly small and the ionization time to convert Ne IX\nto Ne X is smaller than that for Ne X to Ne XI in our\ncase. The empirical formula for SNeX for coronal plasma\nis given in McWhirter (1965, equation 40 of Chapter 5)\nas\nSNeX = 1.10 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(kTe /\u03c7)1/2\n\u03c7\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 ,\nexp\n\u2212\nkTe\n\u03c73/2 (6 + kTe /\u03c7)\n(12)\n\nwhere Te and \u03c7 are the electron temperature and the ionization energy in eV, respectively. Substituting the properties of the hot gas, Te = 7400 eV, \u03c7 = 1360 eV, and\n1/2\nne = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 h70 cm\u22123 , we find \u03c4ion = 3.7 \u00d7 106 years.\nThe evaporation and the equilibration times are much\nsmaller than the cluster crossing time, the characteristic\nscale of the situation. Thus we conclude that, under reasonable assumptions, material within the cluster virial\nradius is not capable of producing the observed Ne IX\nemission unless we are viewing the Coma cluster at a\nvery special epoch.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nOur main result is the detection of absorption and\nemission lines from Ne IX associated with the Coma cluster of galaxies. The absorption is centered on the previously known Coma redshift, although it is of marginal\nstatistical significance (98.0% to 99.2% confidence depending on the analysis method). The emission is statistically significant (3.4\u03c3) and is positionally coincident\nwith Coma. While the absorption line is resolved, its\nwidth is much smaller than the spectral resolution of\nthe emission line data. We do not know if the emission\nand absorption lines have the same profile. The properties of material causing these lines, assuming it is in\na single phase in collisioinal ionization equilibrium, are\nconstrained as follows: temperature T is 2.0 \u00d7 106 K <\nT < 5.8 \u00d7 106 K, density nH is 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm\u22123 < nH <\n8\u00d710\u22125 cm\u22123 , overdensity \u03b4 is 10 < \u03b4 < 400, line of sight\npath length through it is L > 6 Mpc (Z/0.16 Z\u2299 )\u22121 .\nThese properties are similar to those expected of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium and we conclude that we\nhave detected it. The warm-hot intergalactic medium\nis also expected to be distributed in filaments connecting clusters of galaxies. Since X Comae lies behind the\napparent continuation of the Coma-A1367 chain of galaxies to the northeast of the Coma cluster (Gavazzi et al.\n1999), the material we detect may reside in this previously identified filament.\nWe thank the referee for a number of probing questions\nthat improved the paper.
