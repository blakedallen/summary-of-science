The device transparency can be tuned by changing the potential on a\ngate electrode, and for increasing transparencies the effects dominating the transport changes from\nCoulomb Blockade to Universal Conductance Fluctuations with Kondo physics appearing in the\nintermediate region.\n\nAs building blocks for quantum devices, semiconducting nanowires offer an appealing combination of properties not found in other systems. These properties include\na wide range of material parameters of the nanowire itself (e.g. the vanishing nuclear spin of Si-nanowires or the\nhigh g-factor and strong spin-orbit coupling in InAs) and\nthe the wire geometry offering a wide choice of contact\nmaterials (e.g. superconductors or magnetic materials).\nFurthermore, nanowires offer the possibility of changing\nthe crystal composition along the wire to facilitate e.g.\ntailored optical properties. In order to exploit these properties it is important to investigate basic quantum dot\n(QD) phenomena in nanowire devices and already, single electron transport has been demonstrated in weakly\ncoupled nanowire quantum dots in the Coulomb Blockade\n(CB) regime[1, 2, 3] and Universal Conductance Fluctuations (UCF), Weak Localization and Anti-Localization[4]\nhave been observed in low resistance nanowire devices.\nAs a key example of a many-body effect in solid state\nphysics, the Kondo effect in quantum dots has received\nconsiderable theoretical and experimental attention, but\nhas sofar remained elusive in nanowires partly because of\nthe lack of barrier tunability. We here report on semiconducting nanowire devices with electrostatically tunable\ntunnel barriers, and the observation of the Kondo effect\nin the regime where the device acts as a strongly coupled\nquantum dot. We find that the Lande g-factor is significantly different from the bulk value for InAs due to the\nstrong confinement of the wire. Moreover, indications of\nnon-equilibrium Kondo effects are observed.\nOur devices are based on semiconducting InAs-nanowires\ngrown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) from in-situ\ndeposited Au-catalyst particles. The wire diameters are\n\u223c 70 nm and the lengths 2 \u2212 5 \u03bcm. These are the first\nmeasurements on MBE-grown InAs-nanowires and we expect that this well-established technique for growing ultra\nhigh quality III-V materials will produce wires of higher\ncrystal quality and lower impurity concentrations than\nwires grown by other methods, thus resulting in cleaner\nsystems for low temperature transport. Details on the\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Side-view schematic of a nanowire\nquantum dot and the electrical setup. (b) A scanning electron\nmicrograph showing a nanowire device with 300 nm electrode\nseparation. (c) Linear conductance measurements G(Vg ) at\nT = 0.3 K and for temperatures T = 270 K, 130 K, 15 K (inset, top, middle, bottom curve). At 0.3 K and Vg > 2 V the\ncontacts are open and UCF are observed. For \u22126 V < Vg <\n\u22121 V Kondo correlations are observed and for Vg < \u22127V the\ndevice is dominated by CB. (d) QD-backgate capacitance Cg\nas a function of contact separation L.\n\ngrowth and characterization of the wires will be published elsewhere [5]. The wires are transferred from the\ngrowth substrate to a highly doped Si-substrate with a\n500 nm insulating SiO2 cap-layer by gently pressing the\ntwo wafers together. By optical microscopy the wires are\nlocated with respect to predefined alignment marks and\ncontacts are defined by E-beam lithography and subsequent evaporation of Ti/Au (10 nm/60 nm). To obtain\nclean metal-nanowire interfaces the devices are treated\nby a 10 sec. oxygen plasma etch followed by a 5 sec. wet\netch in buffered hydrofluoric acid prior to metal evaporation. Omitting these last steps results in high resistance devices. Figure 1(a) shows a device schematic and\n\n\f2\nFig. 1(b) a scanning electron micrograph of a typical device. The substrate acts as a back-gate electrode and\nfor a given temperature T and external perpendicular\nmagnetic field B the differential conductance dI/dVsd is\nmeasured as a function of the applied source-drain voltage Vsd and back-gate potential Vg using standard lock-in\nmethods.\nFig. 1(c) shows measurements of the linear response conductance G as a function of Vg at different temperatures\nfor a device with L = 200 nm electrode separation. At\nroom temperature (inset) the conductance varies monotonically from 0.9 e2 /h at Vg = \u221210 V to 2.8 e2 /h at\nVg = 10 V thereby identifying the carriers as n-type (here\ne is the electron charge and h Plancks constant). At lower\ntemperatures the slope of the G(Vg )-trace increases but\nthe conductance at Vg = 10 V remains effectively unchanged. This indicates a low barrier at the contacts at\nVg = 10 V increasing with smaller gate-voltages. At 0.3 K\n(main panel), the behavior is as follows: For Vg . \u22127.5 V\nthe device behaves as a quantum dot in the CB regime\nwith large tunnel barriers between the leads and the dot\nwith transport exhibiting sharp peaks separated by regions of zero conductance[6]. For Vg & 2 V reproducible\noscillations due to UCF are observed indicating low barriers between the leads and the QD. In the intermediate\nregion the CB peaks are broadened due to a stronger coupling of the QD to the leads and Kondo physics emerges\nas discussed below. The periodic pattern of CB-peaks\nshows that the device behaves as a single dot rather than\nmultiple dots in series[1]. The average peak separations\n\u2206Vg \u2248 80 mV determine the capacitance from the dot to\nthe back gate Cg = e/\u2206Vg \u223c 2 aF and the linear dependence of Cg on the contact separation (Fig. 1.d) shows\nthat the QD is defined by barriers at the contacts rather\nthan defects along the wire which would result in random\ndot size fluctuations. The curve extrapolates to zero at\nL0 \u2248 100 nm suggesting a significant depleted region at\nthe contacts. For metal contacts to bulk InAs it has been\nshown that the Fermi level pins in the conduction band\n(resulting in good electrical contact[7]), and assuming a\nsimilar behavior for InAs nanowires we believe that the\nQD is formed in the middle of the wire segment between\nthe contacts due to the nonuniform electrical potential\nproduced by the backgate and the grounded contacts.\nWe now focus on the intermediate gate-region of Fig.\n1(c). Black and red traces of Fig. 2(a) show G(Vg ) for\nT = 300mK and T \u2248 800 mK, respectively and a series\nof broadened CB peaks are observed with each valley\ncorresponding to a fixed number of electrons (N ) on the\ndot. The non-zero valley conductance Gv indicate a significant contribution to the conductance from elastic cotunneling processes exhibits an alternating pattern where\nhigh-Gv valleys are followed by valleys of lower Gv and\nvice versa. The even-odd pattern repeats in the addition\nenergies (peak separations \u2206Vg , see inset) suggesting a\ntwofold degeneracy of the dot levels. The electron spin is\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) (a) G vs. Vg for temperatures T =\n300 mK (black) and T \u2248 800 mK (red) showing overlapping\nCB-peaks. Alternating high/low valley conductance with corresponding decreasing/increasing behavior for increasing sample temperature (arrows) is observed. The peak spacings \u2206Vg\n(inset) and their magnetic field dependence [panel (b)] follow a similar even-odd pattern. (d) Corresponding stability\ndiagram (white[black] corresponds to 0e2 /h [1.5e2 /h]) showing faintly visible CB-diamonds indicated by black lines and\nmarked E/O according to even/odd electron occupation number N . A zero-bias Kondo resonance is observed through each\nodd-N CB diamond. The truncation of diamonds (horizontal\nfeatures) indicate the onset of inelastic co-tunneling.\n\nidentified as the origin of this degeneracy by measuring\nthe evolution of the peaks in a magnetic field as shown in\nFig. 2(b). Valleys corresponding to odd(even) N are expected to widen(shrink) by the Zeeman splitting g\u03bcB B[8]\n(\u03bcB is the Bohr magneton) and this pairing behavior is\nreadily observed. Figure 2(c) shows dI/dVsd as a function of Vsd and Vg (stability diagram). A pattern of low\nconductance CB-diamonds (dashed lines), is visible, and\nthe diamonds are numbered E/O according to even/odd\nN as determined from the magnetic field dependency.\nPronounced conductance ridges at zero source-drain bias\nappear in every odd-N diamond. These observations are\nconsistent with the Kondo effect: Whenever the dot holds\nan unpaired electron (odd N ), its spin is screened by\nthe conduction electrons in the contacts through multiple spin-flip tunnel events giving rise to a transport resonance at zero bias[9, 10]. When an even number of\nelectrons reside on the dot the net spin is zero and no\nKondo screening takes place.\nIn addition to the zero-bias resonances in the odd N diamonds the Kondo effect is distinguishable by unique\nmagnetic field and temperature dependencies. The arrows in Fig. 2(a) indicate the temperature dependence of\nthe valley conductance: In the absence of Kondo correlations (even N ) Gv increases upon heating of the sample as\nfor usual CB [6], but in odd-N valleys Gv decreases. The\ntemperature dependence of a Kondo peak is described \u0001by\n\u20322\n\u20322 s\n/(T 2 + TK\n) .\nthe interpolation-function G(T ) = G0 TK\n\u2032\nHere TK\n= TK /(21/s \u2212 1)1/2 and s = 0.22 expected for a\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Top curve: temperature dependence of the peak conductance for a particularly strong Kondo ridge. The solid line\nis a fit to the formula given in the text. The inset shows the\nstability diagram (T = 300 mK) and the lower curve shows\ndI/dVsd vs. Vsd through the middle of the ridge (scaled by a\nfactor of 1/2).\n\nspin-half system[11] and TK is the so-called Kondo temperature. The inset to Fig. 3 shows a stability diagram\nmeasured in a different cool-down of the same device.\nA particularly strong Kondo resonance is observed and\nFig. 3 shows dI/dVsd vs. Vsd through the middle of the\nridge at 300 mK (lower curve) and the valley conductance\nfor different temperatures (upper curve). The solid line\nshows a fit to the formula above and the agreement is excellent yielding TK = 2.1K and s = 0.22 supporting the\nKondo nature of the ridge. The Kondo temperature can\nalso be estimated from the full width at half maximum\n\u0393 \u2248 2kB Tk /e of the Kondo peak and for the data in Fig.\n3 we find \u0393 = 0.34 mV and thus TK = \u0393e/2kB = 2.2 K\nin good agreement with the estimate above.\nIn a magnetic field the spin-degenerate states of the quantum dot are split by the Zeeman splitting g\u03bcB B, which\nfor Kondo resonances leads to peaks at Vsd = \u00b1g\u03bcB B/e,\nindependent of gate voltage[9]. The insets to Fig. 4(a)\nshow stability diagrams of a Kondo ridge measured at\nzero field (left inset) and at B = 0.5 T (right). A gate\nindependent splitting of the ridge is observed and the vertical traces through the middle of the diamond for magnetic fields of 0\u22120.9 T (Fig. 4(a)) shows the evolution of\nthe splitting. Different methods for determining g from\nthe splitting of the Kondo peak have been suggested in\nthe literature. Refs. [12, 13, 14] suggest using the distance \u2206K between the peaks in dI/dV , however, for the\nweak coupling regime theoretical work has suggested the\nuse of the distance \u03b4K between peaks in d2 I/dV 2 (steepest points in dI/dVsd )[15]. Figure 4(b) shows \u03b4K (open\nsquares) and \u2206K (solid squares) extracted from the data\nof Fig. 4(a) and measurements at higher fields. Both \u2206K\nand \u03b4K show a clear linear dependence, and the param-\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) (a) Stability diagrams at B = 0 T\n(left) and B = 0.5 T of a odd-N diamond with a Kondo resonance.

Both methods gives g \u2248 8. The considerable downshift of the g-factor with respect to that of of\nbulk InAs (|gbulk | = 15) reflects the confinement of the\nnanowire geometry and agrees with measurements of g\nin InAs nanowire QD's in the CB-regime[16].\nAt a critical bias voltage Vsd = Vc given by the excitation\nenergy for the dot, inelastic cotunneling processes which\nleave the dot in an excited state set in, giving rise to horizontal ridges at finite bias within the Coulomb diamonds\n(Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 4). Figure 4(a) shows a sharp peak at\nzero field appearing at this onset (Vc \u2248 1.25 mV), in addition to the zero bias Kondo peak (odd N ). In a magnetic\nfield the doublet excited state splits by \u2206c = g\u03bcB B, i.e.\nhalf that of the Kondo peak, allowing for an independent\n\n\f4\nestimate of g. The splitting is readily observed in Fig.\n4(a) and the linear dependence of \u2206c vs. B (Fig. 4(b))\ngives a g-factor of 8.5\u00b10.7 consistent with that measured\nfrom the Kondo peak.\nWe note that non-equilibrium population of the excited\nstates at finite bias[15] may result in a broad cusp at the\ncotunneling on-set rather than a simple finite bias cotunneling step. This mechanism, however, cannot alone\naccount for the peak in Fig. 4(a), being considerably narrower than the threshold bias and we propose that this\npeak is a signature of a Kondo resonance existing out of\nequilibrium. For carbon nanotubes, a detailed quantitative analysis recently showed that for an even N quantum dot inelastic cotunneling processes can result in a\nnon-equilibrium singlet-triplet Kondo effect, accompanying transitions between the singlet ground state (S = 0)\nand an excited triplet state (S = 1)[17]. The Kondo\ncorrelations are in this case indicated by peaks at the cotunneling onset being narrower than the threshold bias.\nWe see similar, sharp peaks in our devices in even N diamonds, however, for the odd N example in Fig. 4a, the\neffect coexists with the zero-bias Kondo effect and the\ncotunneling peak is intensified by (spin-flipping) transitions promoting the dot into excited states with the same\ntotal spin S = 1/2 as the ground state[20]. No theoretical models have been solved to allow for a quantitative\ndescription of this scenario, but presumably, the situation is readily achieved in other Kondo dot systems and\nit deserves theoretical attention.\nThe data illustrates that MBE grown InAs nanowires\ncan constitute highly tunable quantum dots with a rich\nbehavior, including strongly correlated electronic states\nand Kondo physics. Data from two devices is presented,\nhowever, the results are not unique to these: of the 9 devices investigated so far, the Kondo effect was observed\nin 4; the remaining 5 exhibiting only CB. Thus, given\nthe recent advances in making superconducting contacts\nto nanowires[18] the present results show the promise of\nusing nanowires for studying in a semiconductor system\nthe interplay between two of the most pronounced many\nbody effects in solid state physics: superconductivity and\nthe Kondo effect. This subject has been experimentally\naddressable only in carbon nanotube based systems[19].\nFor helpful discussions we acknowledge K. GroveRasmussen, J. Paaske, C. Marcus, K. Flensberg, C.
