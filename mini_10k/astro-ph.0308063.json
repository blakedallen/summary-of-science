Both SIDs are taken to be infinitely thin\nand are in a self-consistent steady background rotational equilibrium with power-law\nsurface mass densities (\u221d r\u22121 ) and flat rotation curves. Recently, Lou & Shen (2003)\nderived exact solutions for both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric stationary perturbations in such a composite SID system and proposed the Ds \u2212criterion of stability\nfor axisymmetric perturbations. Here for axisymmetric perturbations, we derive and\nanalyze the time-dependent WKBJ dispersion relation to study stability properties.\nBy introducing a dimensionless stellar SID rotation parameter Ds , defined as the ratio of the constant stellar rotation speed Vs to the constant stellar velocity dispersion\nas , one can readily determine the axisymmetric stability Ds \u2212criterion numerically\nby identifying a stable range of Ds . Those systems which rotate too slow (collapse)\nor too fast (ring fragmentation) are unstable. We found that the stable range of Ds2\ndepends on the mass ratio \u03b4 of the gaseous SID to the stellar SID and on the square\nof the ratio \u03b2 of the stellar velocity dispersion (which mimics the sound speed) to the\ngaseous isothermal sound speed. Increment of either \u03b4 or \u03b2 or both will diminish the\nstable range of Ds2 . The WKBJ results of instabilities provide physical explanations\nfor the stationary configurations derived by Lou & Shen. It is feasible to introduce\nan effective Q parameter for a composite SID system. The closely relevant theoretical\nstudies of Elmegreen (1995), Jog (1996) and Shu et al. (2000) are discussed. A study\nof composite partial SID system reveals that an axisymmetric dark matter halo will\npromote stability of composite SID system against axisymmetric disturbances. Potential applications to disc galaxies, circumnucleus discs around nuclei of galaxies, and\nprotostellar discs are briefly discussed.\nKey words: stars: formation-ISM: general-galaxies: kinematics and dynamics-\ngalaxies: spiral-galaxies: structure.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the context of galactic disc dynamics, there have been numerous investigations on criteria of axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric disc instabilities (e.g., Binney & Tremaine\n1987). For a single disc of either gaseous or stellar content,\nSafronov (1960) and Toomre (1964) originally derived a dimensionless Q parameter to determine the local stability\n(i.e., Q > 1) against axisymmetric ring-like disturbances.\nBesides a massive dark matter halo, a more realistic disc\ngalaxy involves both gas and stars. It is thus sensible to\nconsider a composite system of one gas disc and one stelc 0000 RAS\n\nlar disc under the gravitational control of the dark matter\nhalo. Theoretical studies on this type of two-component disc\nsystems were extensive in the past (Lin & Shu 1966, 1968;\nKato 1972; Jog & Solomon 1984a, b; Bertin & Romeo 1988;\nRomeo 1992; Elmegreen 1995; Jog 1996; Lou & Fan 1998b,\n2000a, b). In particular, it has been attempted to introduce\nproper definitions of an effective Q parameter relevant to a\ncomposite disc system for the criterion of local axisymmetric\ninstabilities (Elmegreen 1995; Jog 1996; Lou & Fan 1998b).\nThe results of such a stability analysis may provide a basis\nfor understanding composite disc dynamics (e.g. Lou & Fan\n2000a, b; Lou & Shen 2003) and for estimating global star\n\n\f2\n\nY. Shen and Y.-Q. Lou\n\nformation rate in a disc galaxy (e.g., Kennicutt 1989; Silk\n1997).\nThere are several reasons that lead us to once again\nlook into this axisymmetric stability problem. A few years\nago, Shu, Laughlin, Lizano & Galli (2000; see also Galli\net al. 2001) studied stationary coplanar perturbation structures in an isopedically magnetized singular isothermal disc\n(SID) without using the usual WKBJ approximation. They\nfound exact analytical solutions for stationary (i.e., zero\npattern speed) configurations of axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric logarithmic spiral perturbations. According\nto their analysis, for axisymmetric perturbations with radial propagation, a SID with sufficiently slow rotation speed\nwill collapse for sufficiently large radial perturbation scales,\nwhile a SID with sufficiently fast rotation speed will be\nunstable to ring fragmentations for relatively small radial\nperturbation scales (see Fig. 2 of Shu et al. 2000). For axisymmetric perturbations, the stable regime of SID rotation\nspeed may be characterized by a dimensionless rotation parameter D, which is the ratio of the constant SID rotation\nspeed V to the isothermal sound speed a. The critical values\nof the lowest and the highest D for axisymmetric stability\ncan be derived from their marginal stability curves. Shu et\nal. (2000) supported their interpretations by invoking the\nfamiliar Toomre Q parameter, implying that a local WKBJ\nanalysis may still have some relevance or validity to global\nSID perturbation solutions. In their proposed scheme, Shu\net al. noted that the two critical values of D are fairly close\nto Q = 1 for neutral stability. As they did not invoke the\nWKBJ approximation in deriving the analytic perturbation\nsolutions, the Q\u2212criterion and the D\u2212criterion correspond\nto each other well with large wavenumber (ring fragmentation), while the rough correspondence of the Q\u2212criterion\nand the D\u2212criterion for small wavenumbers (collapse) is unexpected where the WKBJ requirement is poorly met.\nRegarding astrophysical applications, these basic properties of D\u2212criterion should be properly applied in contexts\neven at qualitative or conceptual levels. For example, for\nmajority of currently observed disc galaxies, the typical rotation parameter D may be sufficiently large to avoid the\ncollapse regime, that is, these disc galaxies are rotationally\nsupported. Besides other instabilities, the ring fragmentation instability is conceptually pertinent to disc galaxies\nsuch as estimates of global star formation rates (e.g., Jog\n& Solomon 1984a; Kennicutt 1989; Silk 1997; Lou & Fan\n1998b, 2002a, b). Having said these, we should add that the\ncollapse regime of D\u2212criterion might be relevant in early\nstages of galactic disc evolution. That is, slow and fast disc\nrotations of proto-galaxies may be responsible for eventual\nbifurcations into different morphologies of galactic systems.\nFurthermore, for central discs (with radii less than a few\nkiloparsecs) surrounding galactic nuclei with supermassive\nblack holes (e.g., Lynden-Bell 1969) or for protostellar discs\naround central collapsed cores (e.g., Shu 1977), this D parameter may be sufficiently small to induce disc collapses.\nTherefore, both the collapse and ring-fragmentation regimes\n\ncan be of considerable interest in various astrophysical applications.\nRecently, we investigated coplanar perturbation configurations in a composite system of two gravitationally coupled stellar and gaseous SIDs, both taken to be razor thin\n(Lou & Shen 2003). In the ideal two-fluid formalism, we derived analytical solutions for stationary axisymmetric and\nlogarithmic spiral configurations in a composite SID system\nin terms of a dimensionless rotation parameter Ds for the\nstellar SID\u22c6 . By the analogy of a single SID (Shu et al. 2000),\nthese stationary configurations should form marginal stability curves (see Fig. 2 and more extensive results of Lou &\nShen 2003) that separate the stable region from unstable '\nregions for axisymmetric disturbances. Compared with the\nsingle SID case, the stable range of Ds is reduced owing to\nthe presence of an additional gaseous SID and can vary for\ndifferent parameters.\nIn order to make convincing arguments for the above\nanalogy and our physical interpretations, we perform here\na time-dependent local stability analysis using the WKBJ\napproximation for the composite SID system (Lou & Shen\n2003). In a proper parameter regime, we demonstrate the\ncorrectness of interpretations by Shu et al. (2000), and in\ngeneral, we clearly show the validity of using Ds parameter\nto demark stable and unstable regimes. To place our analysis in relevant contexts, we also discuss how the two effective\nQ parameters of Elmegreen (1995) and of Jog (1996) are related to our Ds parameter when other pertinent parameters\nare specified.\nIn Section 2, we derive the time-dependent WKBJ dispersion relation for the composite SID system and define\nseveral useful dimensionless parameters. In Section 3, we\npresent the criterion for the SID system being stable against\nall axisymmetric disturbances. Finally, our results are discussed and summarized in Section 4.\n\n2\n\nTWO-FLUID COMPOSITE SID SYSTEM\n\nHere, we go through the basic fluid equations and derive the\nlocal dispersion relation in the WKBJ approximation (Lin &\nShu 1964). For physical variables, we use either superscript\nor subscript s for the stellar SID and g for the gaseous SID.\nAs both SIDs are assumed to have flat rotation curves with\ndifferent speeds Vs and Vg , we express the mean angular\nrotation speeds of the two SIDs in the forms of\n\u03a9s = Vs /r = as Ds /r,\n\n\u03a9g = Vg /r = ag Dg /r ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere as and ag are the velocity dispersion of the stellar\nSID and the isothermal sound speed in the gaseous SID,\nrespectively. Dimensionless rotation parameters Ds and Dg\nare defined as the ratios of stellar SID rotation speed to\nvelocity dispersion and gaseous SID rotation speed to sound\n\n\u22c6 Subscript\n\ns\n\nindicates the relevance to the stellar SID.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fAxisymmetric Stability Analysis\nspeed, respectively. The two epicyclic frequencies are\n\u221a\n\u03bas \u2261 {(2\u03a9s /r)[d(r 2 \u03a9s )/dr]}1/2 = 2\u03a9s ,\n\u221a\n\u03bag \u2261 {(2\u03a9g /r)[d(r 2 \u03a9g )/dr]}1/2 = 2\u03a9g .\n\n(2)\n\nNote that \u03bas and \u03bag are different in general.\nBy the polytropic assumption for the surface mass\ndensity and the two-dimensional pressure (e.g., Binney &\nTremaine 1987), the fluid equations for the stellar disc, in\nthe cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6, z) at the z = 0 plane, are\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\u03a3s\n+\n(r\u03a3s us ) + 2\n(\u03a3s j s ) = 0 ,\n\u2202t\nr \u2202r\nr \u2202\u03c6\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202us\n\u2202us\nj s \u2202us j s2\n1 \u2202 2 s\n\u2202\u03c6\n+ us\n+ 2\n\u2212 3 =\u2212 s\n(a \u03a3 ) \u2212\n, (4)\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\nr \u2202\u03c6\nr\n\u03a3 \u2202r s\n\u2202r\nj s \u2202j s\n1 \u2202 2 s\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202j s\n\u2202j s\n+ us\n+ 2\n=\u2212 s\n(a \u03a3 ) \u2212\n,\n(5)\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\nr \u2202\u03c6\n\u03a3 \u2202\u03c6 s\n\u2202\u03c6\ns\ns\nwhere \u03a3 is the stellar surface mass density, u is the radial\ncomponent of the bulk fluid velocity, j s is the z\u2212component\nof the specific angular momentum, as is the stellar velocity\ndispersion (or an effective \"isothermal sound speed\"), a2s \u03a3s\nstands for an effective two-dimensional pressure in the polytropic approximation, and \u03c6 is the total gravitational potential perturbation. For the corresponding fluid equations in\nthe gaseous disc, we simply replace the relevant superscript\nor subscript s with g.

In this aspect, it is different from the usual local prescription of a composite\ndisc system (e.g., Jog & Solomon 1984a, b; Bertin & Romeo 1988;\nElmegreen 1995; Jog 1996; Lou & Fan 1998b). Once the ratio of\na2s to a2g is known, the rotation speeds of the composite SID system can be determined through that of the stellar disc, i.e. Ds2 , as\nthe two rotation speeds are coupled dynamically. In the limiting\nregime of a \u226a V and \u03b2 \u226b 1, Vs and Vg are comparable with Vg\nslightly larger by an amount of \u223c (a2s \u2212 a2g )/(2Vs ).

In our analysis,\nwe specify values \u03b4 and \u03b2 to characterize different composite\nSID systems. For late-type spiral galaxies, gas materials are\nless than the stellar mass with \u03b4 < 1. For young proto disc\ngalaxies, gas materials may exceed stellar mass in general\nwith \u03b4 > 1. Thus, in our analysis and computations, both\ncases of \u03b4 < 1 and \u03b4 \u2265 1 are considered. As the stellar\nvelocity dispersion is usually larger than the gas sound speed\n(a2s > a2g ), we then have \u03b2 > 1.

The\nstability analyses of Elmegreen (1995) and Jog (1996) start\nwith the same dispersion relation of Jog & Solomon (1984a).\nThe WKBJ approach of Jog & Solomon (1984a) is generally\napplicable to any locally prescribed properties of a two-fluid\ndisc system. In earlier theoretical studies including that of\nJog & Solomon (1984a), it is usually taken that the rotation speeds of the two fluid discs are equal. Our model of\ntwo coupled SIDs here is self consistent globally with a central singularity and with different SID rotation speeds in\ngeneral. When one applies the local WKBJ analysis to our\ncomposite SID system, the procedure is identical to that of\nJog & Solomon (1984a) but with different local SID speeds\nVs and Vg and hence different epicyclic frequencies \u03bas and\n\u03bag . Therefore, our dispersion (13) appears strikingly similar\nto that of Jog & Solomon (1984a) yet with different \u03bas and\n\u03bag . In short, if one prescribes two different disc speeds and\nthus two different epicyclic frequencies in the analysis of Jog\n\n\f4\n\nY. Shen and Y.-Q. Lou\n\n& Solomon (1984a), the resulting dispersion relation should\nbe our equation (13).\nIn our analysis, the rotation speeds of the stellar and\nthe gaseous SIDs differ in general. In particular, since a2s\nis usually higher than a2g , it follows from equations (1) and\n(8) that \u03a9s < \u03a9g . That is, the stellar disc rotates somewhat slower than the gaseous disc does. Such phenomena\nhave been observed in the solar neighborhood as well as\nin external galaxies (K. C. Freeman, 2003, private communications). This is related to the so-called asymmetric drift\nphenomena (e.g., Mihalas & Binney 1981) and can be understood in terms of the Jeans equations (Jeans 1919) originally\nderived by Maxwell from the collisionless Boltzmann equation. In essence, random stellar velocity dispersions produce\na pressure-like effect such that mean circular motions become slower (Binney & Tremaine 1987). In our treatment,\nthis effect of stellar velocity dispersions is modelled in the\npolytropic approximation (see eqns (2) and (8)). Biermann\n& Davis (1960) discussed the possibility that the mean rotation speeds of the stars and gas in the Galaxy may be different and reached the opposite conclusion that a gas disc\nshould rotate slower than a stellar disc does. However, their\nanalysis based on a virial theorem that excludes the effect of\nstellar velocity dispersions. In other words, the stress tensor\ndue to stellar velocity dispersions in the Jeans equation has\nbeen ignored in their considerations.\n\n2\nWe naturally focus on the \u03c9\u2212\nroot, namely\n2\n\u03c9\u2212\n(k) =\n\n1\n{(H1 + H2 )\n2\n\u2212 [(H1 + H2 )2 \u2212 4(H1 H2 \u2212 G1 G2 )]1/2 } ,\n\nto search for stable conditions that make the minimum of\n2\n\u03c9\u2212\n(k) \u2265 0 for all k.\n2\nBy expanding the \u03c9\u2212\n(k) root in terms of definition (14),\nwe obtain an expression involving parameters \u03ba2s , \u03ba2g , a2s , a2g ,\n\u03a3s0 , \u03a3g0 , and k.

We therefore confirm our previous interpretations for the marginal stability curves for a composite SID\nsystem (Lou & Shen 2003). For a comparison, Fig. 2 shows\nthe corresponding marginal stability curves with \u03b4 = 0.2\nand \u03b2 = 10 that we derived previously (Lou & Shen 2003)\nas the stationary axisymmetric perturbation configuration\nwhere \u03b1 is a dimensionless effective radial wavenumber (see\nalso Shu et al. 2000). The apparent difference in Figs. 1 and\n2, mainly in the collapse regions, arises because the results\nof Fig. 2 are exact perturbation solutions without using the\nWKBJ approximation.\nNow in the WKBJ approximation, the stable range of\nDs2 can be read off from Fig. 1. For the case of \u03b4 = 0.2\nand \u03b2 = 10, the composite SID system is stable from\nDs2 = 0.1193 at K = 0.5121 to Ds2 = 4.1500 at K = 3.9237.\nIn comparison with the single SID case (see Fig. 2 of Shu\net al. 2000), this stable range of Ds2 diminishes. With other\nsets of \u03b4 and \u03b2 parameters, we can derive similar diagrams\nof Fig. 2 as have been done in our recent work, for examples,\nFigs. 7 \u2212 10 of Lou & Shen (2003). In the WKBJ approximation, we show variations with \u03b4 and \u03b2 in Figs. 3 and 4.\nWhen \u03b4 is larger, the system tends more likely to be unstable for small \u03b2. In reference to Fig. 10 of Lou & Shen (2003)\n2\nwith \u03b4 = 1 and \u03b2 = 30, we plot contours of \u03c9\u2212\nin Fig. 5\nin the WKBJ approximation. In this case, the stable range\nof Ds2 disappears, that is, the composite SID system cannot be stable against axisymmetric disturbances. We note\nagain that the collapse region with small wavenumber deviates from the exact result of Fig. 10 of Lou & Shen (2003),\ndue to the obvious limitation of the WKBJ approximation.\nFor the unstable region of large wavenumber, which we labelled as ring fragmentation previously (Lou & Shen 2003),\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\ncollapse\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b1\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nFigure 2. The marginal stability curves of Ds2 versus the dimensionless effective radial wavenumber \u03b1 for m = 0, \u03b4 = 0.2, and\n\u03b2 = 10. While \u03b4 remains small, a larger \u03b2 lowers the ring fragmentation boundary. It is then easier for the SID system to become\nunstable in the form of ring fragmentation but with a larger \u03b1.\n\nFig. 5 here and Fig. 10 of Lou & Shen (2003) show good\ncorrespondence as expected. For the purpose of comparison,\nTable 1 lists several sets of \u03b4 and \u03b2 and the corresponding\nstable range of Ds2 , selected from our stationary perturbation configurations studied earlier (see Figs. 5-10 of Lou &\nShen 2003), using both the WKBJ approximation here and\nthe marginal stability curves of Lou & Shen (2003).\nIt is not surprising that there exist one lower limit and\none upper limit to bracket the stable range of Ds2 . We now\nprovide interpretations for the single SID case. In the usual\nWKBJ analyses, the surface density \u03a3 is prescribed and\nhence independent of the epicyclic frequency \u03ba. In our global\nSID formalism, the surface mass density and the epicyclic\nfrequency are coupled through the rotation parameter D.\nBoth \u03a3 and \u03ba decrease with decreasing D but with different\nrates. Specifically, the surface mass density \u03a3 is proportional\nto 1 + D2 (see eq. (7)) while \u03ba is proportional to D (see eq.\n(2)). For either large or small enough D, the ratio of \u03ba to\n\u03a3 may become less than the critical value (sound speed is\nconstant by the isothermal assumption), that is, the Q parameter becomes less than unity for instabilities.\nWe stress that ring fragmentation instabilities occurring\nat large wavenumbers are familiar in the usual local WKBJ\nanalysis (Safronov 1960; Toomre 1964). While collapse instabilities at small wavenumbers are known recently for the\nSID system (Shu et al. 2000; Lou 2002; Lou & Shen 2003).\nThe physical nature of the new \"collapse\" regime is fundamentally due to the Jeans instability when the radial perturbation scale becomes sufficiently large.\u00b6 By the conservation\n\u00b6 One might wonder how a large-scale disc Jeans instability can\nbe revealed in a local WKBJ analysis although somewhat crudely.\nPerhaps, the best analogy is the WKBJ dispersion relation for\nspiral density waves in a thin rotating disc (Lin & Shu 1966,\n1968). This WKBJ dispersion relation is quadratic in the radial\nwavenumber |k| and can be solved for a larger |k| and a smaller\n\n\f6\n\nY. Shen and Y.-Q.

Hence, there appears a critical Ds2 below which exists\nthe collapse regime. Of course, too large a Ds2 causes the\nother type of ring fragmentation instabilities to set in. For\nmost disc galaxies currently observed, the rotation parameter Ds2 is typically large enough to avoid such collapses.\nElsewhere, the collapse regime studied here may have\n\n|k| corresponding to short- and long-wave branches respectively\n(e.g., Binney & Tremaine 1987). The former is naturally consistent with the WKBJ approximation, while the latter, inconsistent\nwith the WKBJ approximation, turns out to be a necessary key\ningredient in the swing process (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965;\nToomre 1981; Fan & Lou 1997) as revealed by analytical and numerical analyses. In the end, one needs to perform global analyses\nto justify the WKBJ hint for instabilities of relatively large scales.\n\n2 as a function of K and D 2 with\nFigure 5.

In fact, for a low rotation speed Vs , we note from\nthe perspective of evolution, that those proto disc galaxies of\nlow rotation speeds in earlier epochs, will Jeans collapse and\nlead to other morphologies, while those proto disc galaxies\nof sufficiently fast rotation speeds in earlier epochs will gradually evolve into disc galaxies we observe today. Meanwhile,\nring fragmentation instabilities are thought to be relevant to\nglobal star formation in a disc galaxy \u2013 another important\naspect of galactic evolution.\nThe addition of a gaseous SID to a stellar SID will\ndecrease the overall stability against axisymmetric disturbances at any wavelengths in general, that is, the stable\nrange of Ds2 shrinks. However, for the two types of instabilities, namely, the collapse instability at small wavenumbers\nand the ring-fragmentation instability at relatively large\nwavenumbers, the gravitational coupling of the two SIDs\nplay different roles. For instance, a composite SID system\ntends more likely to fall into ring fragmentations but less\nlikely to collapse. For either larger \u03b4 or larger \u03b2, this tendency becomes more apparent.\nThis trend can be understood physically. For the ringfragmentation regime, suppose the stellar SID by itself alone\nis initially stable and a gaseous SID component is added to\nthe stellar SID system in a dynamically consistent manner.\nThe gaseous SID may be either stable or unstable by itself\nalone. By itself, the gaseous SID tends to be more unstable\nif the sound speed ag becomes smaller or \u03a3g0 becomes larger\naccording to the definition of the Q parameter (valid for\nthe ring fragmentation instability), which means larger \u03b2 or\nlarger \u03b4, respectively. Thus, with either \u03b2 or \u03b4 or both being\nlarger, a composite SID system tends to be more vulnerable\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fAxisymmetric Stability Analysis\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b2\n\nlower limit\nof Ds2\n\nhigher limit\nof Ds2\n\n-\n\n1\n\n0.1716(0.9261)\n\n5.8284(5.6259)\n\n0.2\n\n1.5\n5\n10\n30\n\n0.1350(0.8406)\n0.1207(0.7705)\n0.1193(0.7602)\n0.1185(0.7539)\n\n5.3974(5.2117)\n4.4782(4.3558)\n4.1500(4.0611)\n3.8062(3.7670)\n\n1\n\n1.5\n5\n10\n30\n\n0.0596(0.6556)\n0.0411(0.4478)\n0.0401(0.4221)\n-(-)\n\n4.5945(4.4352)\n2.1275(2.0853)\n1.0947(1.0834)\n-(-)\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0.0039(0.1418)\n\n1.7397(1.6718)\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0.0011(-)\n\n0.5696(0.5317)\n\nTable 1.

The interpretation for the collapse\nregime is associated with the dynamical coupling of surface\nmass density \u03a3 and epicyclic frequency \u03ba that leads to the\nfollowing conclusion, namely, a lower velocity dispersion of\nthe gas component seems to prevent collapse. This should\nbe understood from condition (8): for larger \u03b2, the rotation\nspeed Vg will exceeds Vs by a larger margin and helps to\nprevent an overall SID collapse.\nAs already noted, the WKBJ approximation becomes\nworse in the quantitative sense when dealing with small\nwavenumbers where the collapse regime exists. But the stability properties of a SID can be qualitatively understood\nthrough the WKBJ analysis. The exact perturbation analysis of our recent work (Lou & Shen 2003) has shown that the\ncollapse regime diminishes with increasing values of \u03b4 and \u03b2.\nTherefore, once the interpretations are justified physically,\nthe exact procedure of Lou & Shen (2003) should be adopted\nto identify the relevant stable range of Ds2 of a composite\nSID. As much as Shu et al. (2000) have done for a single SID\nanalytically, Lou & Shen (2003) did the same for a composite\nSID system with exact solutions to the Poisson integral. The\nstationary axisymmetric perturbation configurations were\nderived to determine the marginal stability curves. These\nmarginal stability curves have been proven to have the same\nphysical interpretation as the WKBJ marginal curves obtained here.\n\n3.2\n\nEffective Q parameters\n\nIt is natural to extend the concept of the Q parameter for\na single disc to an effective Q parameter for a composite\ndisc system for the purpose of understanding axisymmetric\nstability properties. In the following, we discuss effective Q\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n7\n\nparameters for a composite SID system in reference to the\nworks of Elmegreen (1995) and Jog (1996). There are several points worth noting in our formulation. First, \u03bas and\n\u03bag are related to each other but are allowed to be different\nin general. Secondly, the background surface mass densities\nare related to SID rotation speeds through the polytropic\napproximation and the steady background rotational equilibrium. For the convenience of notations, the effective Q parameters introduced by Elmegreen (1995) and by Jog (1996)\nare denoted by QE and QJ , respectively.\n3.2.1\n\nThe QE parameter of Elmegreen\n\nStarting from equation (18) or (22), we define an effective\nQE parameter in a composite SID system following the procedure of Elmegreen (1995) but with two different epicyclic\n2\nfrequencies \u03bas and \u03bag . The minimum of \u03c9\u2212\nis given by\na2s\n2\n[A2 Kmin\n+ A1 Kmin + A0 \u2212 \u21181/2 ]\n2r 2\n(23)\na2\n2\n= s2 (\u21181/2 \u2212 A2 Kmin\n\u2212 A1 Kmin )(Q2E \u2212 1) ,\n2r\n\n2\n\u03c9\u2212min\n=\n\nwhere\nQ2E \u2261\n\nA0\n2\n\u21181/2 \u2212 A2 Kmin\n\u2212 A1 Kmin\n\n(24)\n\nand \u2118 takes on the value at K = Kmin . As Kmin depends\non Ds2 , \u03b4 and \u03b2, so does Q2E . For specified parameters \u03b4\nand \u03b2 of a composite SID system, the parameter Q2E , giving the criterion of axisymmetric stability (i.e. stable when\nQ2E > 1), corresponds to the rotation parameter Ds2 of the\nstellar disc. One purpose of the present analysis is to establish the correspondence between the axisymmetric stability\ncondition and the marginal stability curves of axisymmetric stationary perturbation configuration derived recently by\nLou & Shen (2003) for a composite SID system. The pertinent results for a single SID can be found in Shu et al.\n(2000).\nOur task now is to find the solution Kmin . As \u03bas 6=\n\u03bag in general, our computation turns out to be somewhat\nmore complicated or involved than that of Elmegreen (1995)\nwho took \u03bas = \u03bag . It becomes more difficult to solve this\nalgebraic problem of order higher than the third analytically.\nHowever, if one multiplies both sides of equation (17) by the\n2\npositive root \u03c9+\n, a simple expression appears\n2 2\nW \u2261 \u03c9+\n\u03c9\u2212 = H1 H2 \u2212 G1 G2 .\n\n(25)\n\nK 3 + aK 2 + bK + c = 0 ,\n\n(27)\n\n2\n\u03c9\u2212\n,\n\nInstead of minimizing\nwe solve for Kc in terms of Ds2\n2 2\nat which W \u2261 \u03c9+ \u03c9\u2212 attains the minimum value. This Kc\nmust satisfy the following equation\nd(H1 H2 \u2212 G1 G2 )\ndW\n(26)\n=\n=0.\ndK\ndK\nBy substituting H1 , H2 , G1 and G2 into equation (26) and\nregarding \u03b4 and \u03b2 as specified parameters, equation (26) can\nbe reduced to a cubic equation of K involving Ds2 , namely,\n\nwhere\na = \u22123(Ds2 + 1)(1 + \u03b2\u03b4)/[4(1 + \u03b4)] ,\n\n\f8\n\nY.

Lou\nb = Ds2 (\u03b2 + 1) + \u03b2 \u2212 1 ,\nc = \u2212(Ds2 + 1)[\u03b2Ds2 (1 + \u03b4) + \u03b2 \u2212 1]/[2(1 + \u03b4)] .\n\nIn most cases k , equation (27) has only one real solution in\nthe form of\nKc = (x \u2212 q/2)1/3 + (\u2212x \u2212 q/2)1/3 \u2212 a/3 ,\n2\n\n3\n\n1/2\n\n2\n\n(28)\n3\n\nwhere x = (q /4 + p /27) , p = b \u2212 a /3 and q = 2a /27 \u2212\nab/3 + c. For a single real root, it is required that q 2 /4 +\np3 /27 > 0 . Through numerical computations, we find that\nthis condition is met for most pairs of \u03b4 and \u03b2.\nWe then regard this Kc as an estimator\u22c6\u22c6 for Kmin to\ndetermine Q2E . As already known in our analysis (Lou &\nShen 2003), when the ratio \u03b2 is equal to 1, the properties\nof a composite SID system have something in common with\nthose of a single SID. Moreover, the stationary axisymmetric\nconfiguration becomes the same as a single SID. We expect\nthat the present problem should reduce to a single SID case\nwhen \u03b2 = 1. We consider below the special case of \u03b2 = 1.\nWith \u03b2 = 1 in equation (27), Kc can be determined in\nterms of Ds2 without involving \u03b4 at all. We then use Kc as\nKmin in the definition of Q2E , namely, condition (24). One\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncan readily verify that Q2E > 1 for 3 \u2212 2 2 < Ds2 < 3 + 2 2;\n\u221a\n\u221a\nQ2E < 1 for Ds2 > 3 + 2 2 or Ds2 < 3 \u2212 2 2; and Q2E = 1\n\u221a\nfor Ds2 = 3 \u00b1 2 2. The range of Ds2 that makes Q2E > 1\nis 0.1716 < Ds2 < 5.8284, which is exactly the same as the\nQ estimator for the single SID of Shu et al. (2000). Based\non estimates of Q parameter alone, Shu et al. (2000) made\nphysical interpretations for their axisymmetric stationary\nperturbation solution curves for a single SID. According to\ntheir interpretation, the maximum D2 = 0.9320 of the collapse branch and the minimum D2 = 5.410 of the ringfragmentation branch (see Fig. 2 of Shu et al. 2000) encompass the required range of D2 for stability against axisymmetric disturbances. As the formulation of Shu et al. (2000)\nis exact in contrast to the WKBJ approximation, the stable range of D2 slightly deviates from that determined by\nthe effective QE parameter. And for the upper bound of D2 ,\nwith a larger wavenumber (or a smaller wavelength), the two\napproaches lead to consistent results as expected.\nIn our recent analysis (Lou & Shen 2003), we obtained\ncurves for stationary axisymmetric perturbations given various combinations of \u03b4 and \u03b2 for a composite SID system.\nThese curves differ from those for a single SID and the stable range of Ds2 varies for different combinations of \u03b4 and\n\u03b2. It is found that this stable range of Ds2 may be significantly reduced for certain values of \u03b4 and \u03b2, as shown in\nFig. 7 \u2212 9 of Lou & Shen (2003) and in the analysis of Section 3.1. Moreover, when \u03b4 and \u03b2 are sufficiently large, the\nk When \u03bas = \u03bag , Bertin & Romeo (1988) give the proof that\nas long as 1/\u03b2 > 0.0294 and \u03b4 > 0.172, there exists only one\n2 . When there are more than one local minima for\nminimum of \u03c9\u2212\n2\n2.\n\u03c9\u2212 , one should choose Kc for the smallest minimum of \u03c9\u2212\n\u22c6\u22c6 While Kc is obtained as the value at which \u03c9 2 multiplying \u03c9 2\n\u2212\n+\nreaches the minimum. It is valid to use Kc to determine whether\n2\n2\n2\nQE > 1 or QE < 1 by realizing that \u03c9+ remains positive and the\n2 \u03c9 2 = 0.\ncritical condition Q2E = 1 is equivalent to \u03c9+\n\u2212\n\nFigure 6. Curves of Q2E versus Ds2 which intersect the horizontal\nline Q2E = 1. For each curve, the two points of intersection at\nQ2E = 1 give the stable range of Ds2 for a composite SID against\naxisymmetric disturbances. The \u03b2 = 1 case gives the same result\nof a single SID.\n\nstable range of Ds2 may no longer exist, as shown in Fig. 10\nof Lou & Shen (2003) and Fig. 5 here. For these cases, a\ncomposite SID system becomes vulnerable to axisymmetric\ninstabilities.\nFor \u03b4 = 0.2 and \u03b2 = 10, as shown in Fig. 6 of Lou &\nShen (2003) and also Fig. 2 of this paper, we search for the\napproximate stable range of Ds2 with the WKBJ dispersion\nrelation (18) for a composite SID system. By using the Q2E\ndefined by equation (24), one can directly plot the curve of\nQ2E versus Ds2 as shown in Fig. 6, from which one can identify\nthe approximate stable range of Ds2 from \u223c 0.1193 to \u223c\n4.1500 where Q2E = 1. Several other curves with different \u03b4\nand \u03b2 are also shown in Fig. 6.\nOne thing that should be emphasized is that the Q2E\nparameter as defined by equation (24) must be positive,\notherwise it may occasionally lead to incorrect conclusions\n2\nregarding the sign of \u03c9\u2212\nas defined by equation (23). More\ndetailed investigations indicate that it is only applicable to\ncases where a composite SID system can be stabilized in a\nproper range of Ds2 . For special cases that cannot be stabilized at all, the Q2E thus defined may not be relevant.\n3.2.2\n\nThe QJ parameter of Jog\n\nThe QE parameter can be derived by solving cubic equation\n(27) for K. It may happen that equation (27) gives three real\nsolutions. In order to obtain an analytical form of Kmin ,\n2\none must identify the absolute minimum of \u03c9\u2212\n. This procedure can be cumbersome. Alternatively, Jog (1996) used a\nseminumerical way to define another effective Q parameter,\nreferred to as QJ here, that is different from QE defined by\nequation (24).\n2\nAccording to solution (17), \u03c9\u2212\nwill be positive or negative if H1 H2 \u2212 G1 G2 > 0 or < 0.

(5) and (6) of Jog 1996). It follows that Q2J < 1\nor > 1 correspond to instability or stability, respectively.\nTherefore, for a given set of \u03b4, \u03b2 and Ds2 , one can numerically determine the value of Kmin . By inserting this Kmin\ninto equation (30), one obtains the value of Q2J for any given\nset of {\u03b4, \u03b2, Ds2 }. It is then possible to explore relevant parameter regimes of interest. Jog (1996) introduced three parameters, namely, the two Toomre Q parameters for each\ndisc and the surface mass density ratio of the two discs, to\ndetermine Q2J . Equivalently, we use three dimensionless parameters \u03b4, \u03b2 and Ds2 instead. Figs. 7 and 8 show variations\nof Q2J with Ds2 . Similar to Q2E , the value of Q2J > 1 when Ds2\nfalls in the same ranges. When \u03b4 is fixed and \u03b2 increases, the\nleft and right bounds of the stable Ds2 range move towards\nleft together, while the width of the stable range appears to\ndecrease. We have revealed the same trend of variations in\nour recent work (Lou & Shen 2003). It is possible for the\nleft bound to disappear when \u03b2 is sufficiently large, and it\nis easier to achieve this when \u03b4 becomes larger. For a sufficiently large \u03b4, the increase of \u03b2 may completely suppress\nthe stable range of Ds2 as shown in Fig. 5 for \u03b4 = 1 and\n\u03b2 = 30.\nIn comparison to QE , the QJ definition (30) is valid\nfor all parameter regimes and avoids improper situations for\nunusual \u03b4 and \u03b2 values. However, to find the value of Q2J\none must perform numerical exploration for each given Ds2 ,\nwhile for Q2E , the procedure is analytical as long as there\nexists a stable range of Ds2 . Regardless, the critical values of\nDs2 found by Q2E and Q2J are equivalent.\n3.3\n\nComposite partial SID system\n\nIn disc galaxies, there are overwhelming evidence for the existence of massive dark matter halos as inferred from more\nor less flat rotation curves. To mimic the gravitational effect\nof a dark matter halo, we include gravity terms \u2202\u03a6/\u2202r and\n\u2202\u03a6/\u2202\u03c6 in the radial and azimuthal momentum equations (4)\nand (5), respectively, where \u03a6 is an axisymmetric gravitational potential due to the dark matter halo. It is convenient\nto introduce a dimensionless parameter F \u2261 \u03c6/(\u03c6 + \u03a6) for\nthe fraction of the disc potential relative to the total potential (e.g., Syer & Tremaine 1996; Shu et al. 2000; Lou\n2002). The background rotational equilibrium is thus modified by this additional \u03a6 accordingly. As\n\u221a before, we\u221awrite\n\u03a9s = as Ds /r, \u03a9g = ag Dg /r, and \u03bas = 2\u03a9s , \u03bag = 2\u03a9g .\nThe equilibrium surface mass densities now become\n\u03a3s0 =\n\na2s (1 + Ds2 )F\n,\n2\u03c0Gr(1 + \u03b4)\n\n\u03a3g0 =\n\na2g (1 + Dg2 )F \u03b4\n,\n2\u03c0Gr(1 + \u03b4)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 F \u2264 1. In our perturbation analysis, the dynamic response of this axisymmetric massive dark matter\nhalo to coplanar perturbations in a composite SID system is\n\n\f10\n\nY. Shen and Y.-Q. Lou\n\nignored\u2020\u2020 (Syer & Tremaine 1996; Shu et al. 2000; Lou 2002).\nWe thus derive similar perturbation equations as those of a\nfull SID case (F = 1) and consequently the similar dispersion relation as equation (13) yet with modified equilibrium\nproperties. Now following the same procedure of WKBJ perturbation analysis described in Section 3.1, we can plot con2\ntours of \u03c9\u2212\nas a function of rotation parameter Ds2 and\nwavenumber K for a composite partial SID system. The\ncase of F = 1 corresponds to a composite full SID system\nthat has been studied in Section 3. When F becomes less\nthan 1 (i.e., a composite partial SID system), which means\nthe fraction of the dark matter halo increases, the stable\nrange of Ds2 becomes enlarged, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10\nfor \u03b4 = 0.2 and \u03b2 = 10. From these contour plots, it is clear\nthat the introduction of a dark matter halo tends to stabilize\na composite partial SID system. For late-type disc galaxies,\none may take F = 0.1 or smaller. Such composite partial\nSID systems are stable against axisymmetric disturbances\nin a wide range of Ds2 . Moreover, those composite full SID\nsystems that are unstable may be stabilized by the presence\nof a dark matter halo, as shown by the example of Fig. 11\nfor \u03b4 = 1, \u03b2 = 30 and F = 0.5 (this case is unstable for a\ncomposite full SID system).\n\n4\n\n2 as function of stellar rotation paramFigure 9. Contours of \u03c9\u2212\n2\neter Ds and wavenumber K for a composite partial SID system\nwith \u03b4 = 0.2, \u03b2 = 10 and F = 0.8.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND SUMMARY\n\nOur model of a composite (full or partial) SID system is an\nidealization of any actual disc systems, such as disc galaxies,\ncircumnuclear discs surrounding nuclei of galaxies, or protostellar discs. One key feature of the SID model is the flat\nrotation curve. One major deficiency in galactic application\nis the central singularity that sometimes even gives rise to\nconflicting theoretical interpretations (see Shu et al. 2000).\nThe isothermality is yet another simplifying approximation.\nIn galactic applications, the common wisdom is to introduce\na bulge around the center to avoid the central singularity.\nBy a local WKBJ stability analysis of axisymmetric perturbations, this model can be utilized as usual with qualifications. We now discuss the WKBJ results in the context of\n\n\u2020\u2020 Strictly speaking, gravitational perturbation coupling between\na thin, less massive, rotating disc and a more massive dark matter halo together with proper matching and boundary conditions\nshould lead to an increasing number of modes that may or may\nnot be stable. We simplify by noting numerical simulations have\nindicated that a typical galactic dark matter halo has a relatively\nhigh velocity dispersion of the order of several hundred kilometers\nper second. The rationale of the simplification is that perturbation coupling between those in the SID system and those in the\ndark matter halo becomes weak for a high velocity dispersion in\nthe dark matter halo. For example, for a non-rotating spherical\ndark matter halo, effective \"acoustic\" and \"gravity\" modes (i.e.,\np\u2212modes and g\u2212modes in the parlance of stellar oscillations; Lou\n1995) can exist within; these p\u2212 and g\u2212modes are expected to\nbe Landau damped in a collisionless system. However, the stability of \"interface modes\" between a thin rotating disc and a dark\nmatter halo remains to be investigated.\n\n2 as function of stellar rotation paramFigure 10.

First, the\nisothermal assumption implying constant as and ag throughout the disc system is a gross simplification; the velocity dispersion as in the Milky Way decreases with increasing radius\n(e.g., Lewis & Freeman 1989). Secondly, by the polytropic\napproximation, the surface mass densities are characterized\nby power-law \u221d r \u22121 profiles, which appear not to be the case\nof the Milky Way (e.g., Caldwell & Ostriker 1981). Nevertheless, to estimate local stability properties of a disc portion,\nwe may take as = 50 km s\u22121 , Vs = 220 km s\u22121 , \u03b4 = 0.1\nand flat rotation speed Vs = 220 km s\u22121 around 4 kpc from\nthe center of our Galaxy.

Following the\ndefinition of Jog (1996), the value of QJ \u226b 1. While for full\nSIDs with F = 1, we get QJ = 0.17 which means local instability. Obviously, the dark matter halo plays the key role\nin stabilizing the system.\nThe composite partial SID model with power-law \u221d r \u22121\nsurface mass densities may not describe the Milky Way well.\nBut for those disc galaxies with flat rotation curves and\napproximate power-law \u221d r \u22121 surface mass densities, our\nmodel should offer a sensible local criterion for axisymmetric\ninstability. For example, given radial variations of velocity\ndispersions and gas mass fraction, we may deduce locally\nunstable zones.\nFor circumnuclear discs around nuclei of galaxies, the\nstellar velocity dispersion as can be as high as several hundred kilometers per second along the line of sight (e.g., Whitmore et al. 1985; McElroy 1994); this may then lead to small\nDs2 . Within such a parameter regime, the collapse instability\nmay set in during a certain phase of system evolution. For\ninstance, in the case of Fig. 2 with \u03b4 = 0.2 and \u03b2 = 10, we\nchoose Vs = 200 km s\u22121 and as = 300 km s\u22121 in a circumnuclear disc region of a disc galaxy. The resulting Ds2 = 0.44\nwould give rise to collapse and the composite SID system\nmight eventually evolve into a bulge of high velocity dispersion.\nAnother possible collapse situation of interest corresponds to small Ds2 for sufficiently low disc rotation speed V .\nPotential applications include but not limited to protostellar\ndiscs in the context of star formation. We here briefly discuss several qualitative aspects. For a protostellar disc system, the two disc components here may be identified with\nthe relatively \"hot\" gas disc and the relatively \"cool\" dust\ndisc. Interactions of radiation fields from the central protostar with cool dusts in the disc lead to infrared emissions.

This simple model\ntreatment may need to be complemented by other processes\nof coupling such as collisions between gas and dust particles.\nWhen such a composite disc system rotates at a low speed\n(e.g., Shu et al. 1987), the rotation parameter D could be\nlow enough to initiate large-scale collapse. The subsequent\ndynamical processes will drive the composite SID system to\nmore violent star formation activities.\nSo far we have investigated the axisymmetric stability\nproblem for a composite system of gravitationally coupled\nstellar and gaseous SIDs using the WKBJ approximation\nand we now summarize the results of our analysis.\nFirst, because the single SID case studied by Shu et al.\n(2000) may be regarded as the special case of a composite SID system, the results of our WKBJ analysis clearly\nsupport the physical interpretations of Shu et al. (2000) for\nthe marginal stability curves of axisymmetric perturbations.\nThe \"ring fragmentation regime\" is related to the familiar Q\nparameter (Safronov 1960; Toomre 1964). The presence of\nthe Jeans \"collapse regime\" can be traced to the SID model\nwhere self-gravity, effective pressure, and SID rotation compete with each other.\nSecondly, the recent study of Lou & Shen (2003) generalizes that of Shu et al. (2000) and describes exact perturbation solutions in a composite SID system. We obtained\nmarginal stability curves for axisymmetric perturbations\nthat are qualitatively similar to those of Shu et al. (2000)\nand that depend on additional dimensionless parameters. It\nis natural to extend the interpretations of Shu et al. (2000).\nThrough the WKBJ analysis here, we now firmly establish\nthe presence of two regimes of \"ring fragmentation\" and\n\"collapse\" in a composite SID system. It is fairly straightforward to apply our exact D\u2212criterion for a composite SID\nsystem, not only for disc galaxies, but also for other disc\nsystems including circumnuclear discs and protostellar discs\netc.\nThirdly, in the WKBJ approximation, it is also possible to relate our D\u2212criterion to the QE criterion similar to\nthat of Elmegreen (1995). Because \u03bas and \u03bag are different\nin general, our WKBJ treatment is not the same as that of\nElmegreen (1995).\nFourthly, also in the WKBJ approximation, we relate\nour D\u2212criterion to the QJ criterion as defined by Jog (1996)\nbut with \u03bas 6= \u03bag in general. We find that the QJ criterion\nis fairly robust in the WKBJ regime.\nFinally, we further consider the axisymmetric stability\nof a composite partial SID system to include the gravitational effect from an axisymmetric dark matter halo. The\nstabilizing effect of the dark matter halo is apparent.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the referee C. J. Jog for comments and suggestions.
