Introduction\nPSR\nB 1509-58\n(Seward & Harnden 1982,\nManchester et al. 1982) is situated not far from the\ngeometrical centre of the SNR MSH 15-52 (or G 320.401.2), and their association is beyond any doubt. However,\nthis association causes a number of difficulties for the\nunderstanding and interpretation of the observational\ndata. The problem is that the size and the general\nappearance of the SNR suggest that it should be much\nolder than it follows from the pulsar age estimates.\nIt is usually assumed that the rotational frequency\n\u03a9 of a pulsar decreases according to the relation \u03a9\u0307 =\n\u2212 K\u03a9n , where K depends upon the physics of the slowdown mechanism, and n = \u03a9\u03a9\u0308/\u03a9\u03072 is the braking index. Assuming constant K and n, and provided that the\ninitial spin period Pi of the pulsar was much smaller\nthan the current period P = 2\u03c0/\u03a9, one can estimate\nthe characteristic spin-down age \u03c4 = P/(n \u2212 1)\u1e56 . For\nP \u2243 0.15 s, \u1e56 \u2243 1.49 * 10\u221212 s s\u22121 and n = 2.84\n(Weisskopf et al. 1983, Manchester et al. 1985, Kaspi et\nal. 1994), one derives an age of PSR B 1509-58 of \u2243\n1700 years, i.e. it is nearly as young as the Crab pulsar. The spin-down age could be even less by a factor\nof [1 \u2212 (Pi /P )n\u22121 ]\u22121 , if the pulsar was born with Pi\nof \u2243 0.1 s (see e.g. Spruit & Phinney 1998). These estimates are at odds with the age estimates for MSH 1552 (Seward et al. 1983, van den Berg & Kamper 1984,\nKamper et al. 1995), which show that the SNR is a much\nolder object.\nTo reconcile the ages of the pulsar and the SNR, Seward et al. (1983) considered two possibilities: 1) MSH 1552 is a young SNR, and 2) PSR B 1509-58 is an old\npulsar. The first one implies (in the framework of the\nSedov-Taylor model) that the SN explosion was very\nenergetic and occured in a tenuous medium (see also\nBhattacharya 1990). This point of view is generally accepted (e.g. Kaspi et al. 1994, Greiveldinger et al. 1995,\nTrussoni et al. 1996, Gaenzler et al. 1999). The second\npossibility implies that \u03c4 is at least few times shorter than\n\u22c6\n\nAddress for correspondence: Krasin str. 19, ap. 81, Moscow,\n123056, Russia (vgvaram@mx.iki.rssi.ru)\n\nthe \"true\" age (Seward et al. 1983). This possibility was\nre-examinated by Blandford & Romani (1988). Assuming\nthat the pulsar spin-down is mostly due to the electromagnetic torque, they suggested that the torque grew within\nthe last \u2243 103 years due to the growth of the pulsar's magnetic field (see also Muslimov & Page 1996). In this case,\nthe coefficient K is an increasing function of time and\ntherefore the \"true\" age of the pulsar could be as large as\nfollows from the age estimates for the SNR. In this paper\nwe offer an alternative explanation for the increase of the\nbraking torque (Sect. 2), viz. we suggest that it could be\nepisodically enhanced due to the interaction of the pulsar's magnetosphere with dense clumps of circumstellar\nmatter (Sect. 3). Sect. 4 deals with some issues related to\nour suggestion.\n\n2. The spin-down of PSR B 1509-58\nIt is known that the electromagnetic torque acting on\na rotating, magnetized body (e.g. a neutron star) immersed in a plasma is enhanced as compared with the\ntorque in vacuum (Ginzburg 1971, see also Istomin 1994).\nIt was mentioned by Istomin (1994) that for the increase of the slow-down torque of a pulsar it is suffient\nto have a dense plasma in the vicinity of the light cylinder, since just in this region the pulsar loses its rotational\nenergy due to the acceleration of particles. The particles of the ambient medium penetrating into the region\nof the light cylinder are accelerated there to velocities\ncomparable with the speed of light and then leave this\nregion (Istomin 1994). This presumably equatorial outflow (cf. Brinkmann et al. 1985, King & Cominsky 1994)\ncarries away the pulsar's angular momentum and is responsible for the enhanced braking of the pulsar. We suggest (see also Gvaramadze 1999a; cf. Yusifov et al. 1995,\nIstomin & Komberg 2000) that just this effect is responsible for the present high spin-down rate of PSR B 1509-58,\ni.e. that the pulsar loses its rotational energy mainly due\nto the acceleration of protons of the ambient medium arriving at the light surface at the rate \u1e40 :\n(1)\n|\u0116| = |I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307| = \u03b3p \u1e40 c2 ,\n\n\fV.V.Gvaramadze: On the age of PSR B 1509-58\n\nwhere I \u2243 1045 g cm2 is the moment of inertia of the\npulsar, c is the speed of light, and \u03b3p is the Lorentz\nfactor of accelerated protons. For \u03a9 = 41.89 s\u22121 and\n\u03a9\u0307 = \u22124.25 * 10\u221210 s\u22122 (e.g. Kaspi et al. 1994), and \u03b3p \u2243 1\n(Istomin 1994), one has \u1e40 \u2243 2.2 * 1016 g s\u22121 . We also suggest that the pulsar moves through the inhomogeneous\nambient medium and episodically plunges into clumps of\ndense matter. If the density of clumps is sufficiently high\n(see Sect. 3), one can expect a temporary increase of \u03a9\u0307\nevery time the pulsar travels through a clump (we believe\nthat just this situation takes place now). The corresponding spin-down age will be less than estimated when the\npulsar moves through the low-density interclump medium.\nIt is clear that the presence of radio emission of the\npulsar means that the ambient medium does not penetrate far beyond the light surface. Assuming that the ram\npressure of the accreting medium is equal to the magnetic\npressure at the light surface (cf. King & Cominsky 1994),\none has an estimate of the surface magnetic field of the\npulsar1 :\ni1/2\nh\n7/2\n\u2243 2.9 * 1012 G ,\nB\u2217 = 2(2GM\u2217 )1/2 \u1e40 rL /r\u22176\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M\u2217 = 1.4 M\u2299 and\nr\u2217 = 106 cm are the mass and the radius of the pulsar, and\nrL = c/\u03a9 \u2243 7.1 * 108 cm is the radius of the light cylinder;\nfor simplicity we assumed that the pulsar magnetic field\nis dipolar. Given this value of B\u2217 , one can estimate the\n\"vacuum\" values of \u03a9\u0307 and \u03c4 : \u03a9\u03070 = \u22122\u03bc2 \u03a93 /3c3 I \u2243 \u22121.36*\n10\u221211 s\u22122 , where \u03bc = B\u2217 r\u22173 is the magnetic momentum of\nthe pulsar, and \u03c40 \u2264 \u2212\u03a9/2\u03a9\u03070 \u2243 4.9 * 104 yr \u2243 30\u03c4 (here\nwe assumed that the \"vacuum\" braking index is equal to\n3). This means that the \"true\" age of the pulsar could be\nas large as \u03c40 (provided that Pi \u226a P ) and that the SNR\nMSH 15-52 could be a middle-aged remnant similar to the\nVela SNR (G 263.9-3.3).\n3. Dense clumps in the central part of SNR\nMSH 15-52\nWe suggest that PSR B 1509-58 and SNR MSH 15-52\nare the remnants of the SN explosion of a massive\nstar (Gvaramadze 1999b). In this case, the structure of MSH 15-52 could be determined by the\ninteraction of the SN blast wave with the ambient medium reprocessed by the joint action of the\nionizing emission and stellar wind of the SN progenitor star (McKee et al. 1984, Shull et al. 1985,\nCiotti & D'Ercole 1989,\nChevalier & Liang 1989,\nFranco et al. 1991, D'Ercole 1992, Gvaramadze 1999b,c,\n2000a). The outer shell of the SNR could arise due to\nthe abrupt deceleration of the SN blast wave after it\nencounters the density jump at the edge of the bubble\ncreated by the fast stellar wind during the main-sequence\n1\n\nNote that this estimate is about ten times smaller\nthan what follows from the usual dipole formula\n(Weisskopf et al. 1983).\n\n3\n\nor the Wolf-Rayet (WR) stages. On the other hand,\nsome structures in the central part of the SNR2 could\nbe attributed to the interaction of the SN blast wave\nwith the circumstellar material lost during the late\nevolutionary stages of the SN progenitor star (this is\nthe material that determines the appearance of young\ntype II SNRs, e.g. SN 1987A (e.g. McCray 1993) or Cas A\n(e.g. Garcia-Segura et al. 1996, Borkowski et al. 1996)).\nDuring the red supergiant (RSG) stage a massive star\nloses a significant part (about two thirds) of its mass in\nthe form of a slow, dense wind. This matter occupies\na compact region with a characteristic radius of few\nparsecs (the high-pressure gas in the main-sequence\nbubble significantly affects the spreading of this region (Chevalier & Emmering 1989, D'Ercole 1992)).\nBefore the SN exploded, the progenitor star (of mass\n> 15 \u2212 20 M\u2299 ) becomes for a short time a WR star\n(e.g. Vanbeveren et al. 1998). At this stage, the fast\nstellar wind sweeps up the slow RSG wind and creates\na low-density cavity surrounded by a shell of swept-up\ncircumstellar matter. The shell expands with a nearly\n2\nconstant velocity vsh \u2243 (\u1e40WR vWR\nvRSG /3\u1e40RSG )1/3 ,\nwhere \u1e40WR , \u1e40RSG and vWR , vRSG are, correspondingly,\nthe mass-loss rates and wind velocities during the WR\nand RSG stages (e.g. Dyson 1981), until it catches up the\nshell separating the RSG wind from the main-sequence\nbubble. For parameters typical for RSG and WR winds,\none has vsh \u2243 100 \u2212 200 km s\u22121 . The interaction of two\ncircumstellar shells results in Rayleigh-Taylor and other\ndynamical instabilities, whose development is accompanied by the formation of dense clumps moving with\nradial velocities of \u2243 vsh (Garcia-Segura et al. 1996).\nThe dense clumps could originate much closer to the\nSN progenitor star due to the stellar wind acceleration\nduring the transition from the RSG to the WR stage\n(Brighenti & D'Ercole 1997). The number density of\nclumps is \u2265 105 cm\u22123 provided they are not fully ionized\nand were able to cool to a temperature of \u2264 102 K\n(Brighenti & D'Ercole 1997). Direct evidence of the\nexistence of high-density clumps close to the SN explosion\nsites follows from observations of young SNRs. For example, the optically emitting gas of quasi-stationary flocculi\nin Cas A is characterized by a density of \u2243 104 cm\u22123\nand a temperature of \u2265 104 K (e.g. Lozinskaya 1992).\nAssuming that the optical emission of a floccule comes\nfrom an ionized \"atmosphere\" around the neutral core,\none can estimate the density of the core to be \u2265 106 cm\u22123 ,\nprovided that the temperature of the core is \u2264 102 K.\nSimilar estimates could also be derived from observations\nof the optical ring around SN 1987A, the inner ionized\n\"skin\" of which has nearly the same parameters (e.g.\n2\nNote that these structures could be significantly offset\nfrom the geometrical centre of a middle-aged SNR due to the\nproper motion of the SN progenitor star (Gvaramadze 1999b,\n2000a,b).\n\n\f4\n\nV.V.Gvaramadze: On the age of PSR B 1509-58\n\nPlait et al. 1995) as the optically emitting gas of flocculi\nin Cas A, or from observations of some other young\nSNRs (e.g. Chugai 1993, Chugai & Danziger 1994). The\nradial velocity of flocculi in Cas A ranges from \u2243 80 to\n\u2243 400 km s\u22121 (e.g. Lozinskaya 1992).\nInitially, the new-born pulsar moves through the lowdensity cavity created by the fast wind of the presupernova star until it plunges into the first dense clump on\nits way. This happens at the moment t \u223c rcav /v\u2217 , where\nrcav \u2243 1 \u2212 2 pc is the radius of the cavity, v\u2217 = vp \u2212 vcl ,\nvp and vcl are respectively the velocities of the pulsar and\nthe clump. For vp \u2243 150 km s\u22121 and vcl \u2243 100 km s\u22121 , one\nhas t \u2243 (2 \u2212 4) * 104 years3 . Let us assume that all matter captured inside the accretion radius racc = 2GM\u2217 /v\u22172\n(v\u2217 \u226b cs , where cs is the sound speed in the cold, dense circumstellar clump) of the pulsar moving through the clump\npenetrates into the region of the light cylinder, where it is\naccelerated to relativistic velocities and then leaves this region in the form of equatorial outflow (cf. Istomin 1994 and\nKing & Cominsky 1994). The rate at which the ambient\nmedium arrives at the light cylinder could be estimated\nas\n2\n\u1e40 = \u03c0racc\nncl mp v\u2217 ,\n(2)\nwhere ncl is the number density of the clump, and mp is\nthe mass of a proton. If the pulsar braking is indeed mainly\ndue to the acceleration of circumstellar protons arriving at\nthe light surface, then one obtains from (1) and (2) that\n2\ncm\u22123 , where v\u2217,50 = v\u2217 /50 km s\u22121 .\nncl \u2243 3.8 * 106 v\u2217,50\nThe time it takes for PSR B 1509-58 to cross the clump,\n\u2032\nt \u2243 lcl /v\u2217 , where lcl is the characteristic size of clumps,\nshould be larger than the time since the pulsar discovery,\n\u2032\ni.e. t > 30 years. This requirement results in lcl \u2265 5 *\n15\n3\n10 v\u2217,50 cm and Mcl > 0.0002v\u2217,50\nM\u2299 , where Mcl is the\ncharacteristic mass of clumps. For the SN progenitor star\nof mass \u2265 15M\u2299 , the mass of the circumstellar gas (i.e.\nthe matter lost during the RSG stage) is about 10M\u2299, and\nthe number of clumps is < 5 * 104 . For the current radius\nof the region occupied by circumstellar matter of about\n10 pc (Gvaramadze 1999b), one finds a covering factor of\nthe clumpy circumstellar material (i.e. the fraction of the\nsphere occupied by clumps) \u2243 10\u22124 .\nFor accretion to occur, the standoff radius rs of the\nbow shock (formed by the outflow of relativistic particles)\nshould be less than racc . For the spherically symmetric\noutflow, one has rs = (\u03b1|\u0116|/4\u03c0ncl mp cv\u22172 )1/2 < racc =\n2GM\u2217 /v\u22172 , where we assume that only a fraction \u03b1 < 1 of\n3\n\nNo proper motion for PSR B 1509-58 has yet been detected\n(Kaspi et al. 1994, Gaensler et al. 1999), though the recent finding of the candidate optical counterpart of this pulsar (Caraveo\net al. 1994, see also Mignami et al. 1998 and Sect.4) allows one\nto hope that it will be detected in due course. For the distance\nto the pulsar of 5d5 kpc (e.g. Gaensler et al. 1999), a velocity\nof 150 km s\u22121 corresponds to a proper motion of \u2243 6 mas yr\u22121 ;\nthis is much smaller than the upper limits on the pulsar's\nproper motion given by Kaspi et al. (1994) and Gaensler et\nal. (1999).\n\nthe spin-down luminosity |\u0116| is transferred to the ambient medium (cf. Kochanek 1993). This condition can\nbe re-written as \u03b1 < (\u03b3p /4)\u22121 v\u2217 /c \u2243 10\u22123 \u03b3p\u22121 v\u2217,50 (cf.\nKochanek 1993, Manchester et al. 1995), i.e. \u03b1 should be\nmuch smaller than the usually adopted value of \u2243 1 (e.g.\nKulkarni & Hester 1988, Cordes et al. 1993). Weak coupling (\u03b1 \u226a 1) of the pulsar wind with the ambient medium\nis consistent with an outflow composed of highly relativistic particles (e.g. Kochanek 1993 and references therein).\nAlternatively, if the outflow of relativistic particles is confined to the vicinity of the rotational equatorial plane, one\ncan expect that the ambient matter accretes onto the pulsar's magnetosphere along the polar directions. Another\npossibility is that the ambient matter penetrates in the\npulsar wind bubble through instabilities in the bow shock\nfront. In the latter both cases rs could be larger than racc ,\nand one can adopt \u03b1 \u2243 1 (see next section).\n4. Discussion\nWe now discuss some consequences of our proposal that\nthe braking of PSR B 1509-58 is mostly due to the interaction of the pulsar's magnetosphere with the dense matter\nof a circumstellar clump.\nFirst, we consider the contribution of the circumstellar matter to the neutral hydrogen absorption toward the\npulsar. The low covering factor of clumps (see Sect. 3)\nimplies that this contribution is\nracc\nZ\nNcl =\nnff (r)dr + ncl (rcl \u2212 racc ) ,\n(3)\nrL\n\nwhere nff (r) = \u1e40 /4\u03c0mp r2 vff is the number density of the\ninfalling gas captured inside the accretion radius, vff =\n(2GM\u2217 /r)1/2 is the free-fall velocity, rcl is the line of sight\nthickness of the dense neutral gas located between the\npulsar and the observer (rcl \u2264 lcl ).\nIt was pointed out by Strom (1994) that a ROSAT\nobservation of the SNR MSH 15-52 indicates a larger\nabsorption towards PSR B 1509 - 58 than seen from\nthe bright northwest part of the SNR's shell (known as\nRCW 89). The comparison of neutral hydrogen absorption\ndata (see Greiveldinger et al. 1995, Trussoni et al. 1996,\nTamura et al. 1996,\nMarsden et al. 1997,\nRots et al. 1998) shows that the excess of absorption towards the pulsar could be as large as \u2243 (1 \u2212 5) * 1022 cm\u22122 .\nThis discrepancy could be interpreted as a sign that the\npulsar is more distant than the SNR, and therefore that\nthese two objects are not physically associated with each\nother (Strom 1994). It is also possible that \"the spectral\nanalysis is not detailed enough to provide the correct\nparameters\" (Trussoni et al. 1996). Another possibility\nis that the H I column density distribution is really\ninhomogeneous across the SNR (cf. Trussoni et al. 1996).\nWe favour the last possibility and suggest that the excess\nof absorption towards PSR B 1509-58 is due to the dense\nneutral gas around the pulsar. One can use Eq. (3) to set\n\n\fV.V.Gvaramadze: On the age of PSR B 1509-58\n\nan upper limit on rcl . For the parameters adopted above,\nand assuming that Ncl \u2264 (1 \u2212 5) * 1022 cm\u22122 , one has\n\u22123\nrcl \u2264 (0.2 \u2212 1.2) * 1016 v\u2217,50\ncm. This estimate shows that\nif our explanation of the age discrepancy is correct, then\none might expect that in the near future (i.e. after a lapse\nof \u2243 rcl /v\u2217,k , where v\u2217,k is the line of sight component\nof v\u2217 ) the first derivative of the pulsar's spin period will\nsuffer a significant decrease.\nSecond, let us discuss the candidate optical counterpart for PSR B 1509-58 proposed by Caraveo et al. (1994).\nCaraveo et al. pointed out that the luminosity of the optical counterpart (LV \u223c 6.5 * 1032 d25 ergs s\u22121 ) exceeds by\na few orders of magnitude the value derived for magnetospheric optical emission of young pulsars (Pacini 1971).\nThis fact together with the negative result of searching\nof optical pulsations at the radio period led to the conclusion that the proposed identification could be erroneous (Mignami et al. 1998; see also Shearer et al. 1998,\nChakrabarti & Kaspi 1998). We suggest, however, that\nthe observed optical emission should rather be attributed\nto the bow shock around the pulsar than to the pulsar\nitself. This suggestion is supported by the estimate of the\ntotal luminosity of the bow shock, LT \u2243 Sncl v\u2217 (mp v\u22172 /2),\nwhere S \u2243 \u03c0rb2 and rb \u2243 31/2 rs are the area and the characteristic radius of the bow shock, respectively. For the\nadopted parameters4 this gives LT \u2243 \u03b1 * 1033 ergs s\u22121 , i.e.\nLV \u2243 LT for \u03b1 \u2243 1. It is obvious that if our suggestion is\ncorrect, there can be no correspondence between the observed luminosity and the luminosity expected from the\nresults of Pacini (1971). The optical pulsations should be\nabsent as well.\nTo conclude, we point out a curious coincidence\nof the accretion rate derived in Sect. 2 with accretion rates required in accretion-based models to explain\nhigh spin-down rates of anomalous X-ray pulsars and\nsoft gamma-ray repeaters (e.g. Mereghetti & Stella 1995,\nGhosh et al. 1997, Chatterjee et al. 2000, Alpar 2000).\nThis coincidence allows us to believe (Gvaramadze 1999a,\n2000b) that these objects could lose a significant part of\ntheir rotational energy due to the process discussed in this\npaper, and that their \"true\" ages could be much larger\nthan the respective characteristic spin-down ones.\nAcknowledgements.
