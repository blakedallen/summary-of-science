It is conjectured that in the classical limit, terms in the Hamiltonian which add\na new vertex will be suppressed, compared to terms which modify\nthe existing spin network without changing the number of vertices.\nPACS categories: 04.60, 04.30\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: dneville@temple.edu\n1\n\n\fI\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn two previous papers, which I will refer to as papers 1 and 2, I\nconstructed a set of coherent states for planar gravity waves [1, 2].\nThe earlier papers do not propose any Hamiltonian.\nHowever, there are two (at least) questions about coherent states\nwhich cannot be answered without knowing the Hamiltonian, or at\nleast knowing a little bit about the Hamiltonian. The two questions\nfocus on the rate of spreading of the coherent state wave packet\n(section II), and the possible addition of non-classical, low spin vertices in the classical limit (section III). The little bit of knowledge\ncomes from dimensional analysis. The answers given are necessarily\ntentative, and these questions should be asked again when more is\nknown about the Hamiltonian.\nAt several points I use the following results, derived in appendices\nC through E of paper 2. The angles and angular momentum for the\ncoherent state are Gaussian\u221a distributed, and the standard deviations of angles are order 1/ < \u221a\nL >, while the standard deviations\nof angular momenta are order < L >. < L > is the average, or\npeak value of the magnitude of angular momentum for the coherent\nstate.\n(Coherent states also contain\n\u221a a parameter t, and appendix C of\npaper 2 quotes a value of 1/ t for the standard deviation of L.\nHowever, appendix D shows t must be order 1/ < L > in order to\nminimize the size\n\u221a of small correction terms. Therefore the standard\ndeviation\n\u221a of 1/ t is\u221anot an exception. All standard deviations are\norder < L > or 1/ < L >.\n\nII\n\nWave Packet Spreading\n\nIn paper 2 I computed explicitly the matrix elements.\nhu, ~p | (\u1ebc or h) | u, ~pi,\nwhere \u1ebc and h are densitized inverse triad and holonomy, and the\ncoherent states are labeled by a unitary matrix u and a vector p~.\nHowever, there are many other matrix elements of the form\nhu\u2032 , ~p\u2032 | \u1ebc | u, ~pi\n2\n\n\fwhich I did not consider. For u\u2032 \u2248 u and ~p\u2032 \u2248 ~p, the overlap could\nbe large. Do these matrix elements play a role? This is an apparent\nproblem with dealing with an overcomplete set.\nThis problem is perhaps more apparent than real. In the coherent\nstate approach to the classical limit, one works only with diagonal\nmatrix elements, the expectation values\nhu, ~p | (\u1ebc or h) | u, ~pi.\nOne does not worry about matrix elements to other coherent states,\nbut only about how rapidly the wave packet | u, ~pi will spread. Provided the time scale governing the spreading is large, the expectation\nvalues can be used to make predictions.\nA\n\nSpreading in the weak field limit\n\nIn the weak field limit the gravitational Hamiltonian decouples into\na sum of oscillators. These are especially easy to treat using coherent\nstate methods. We can expect something like\n< \u03b4 \u1ebc (z, T = 0) >= A cos (kz + \u03b3)\n\n(1)\n\nfor time T = 0; and oscillator packets are known to follow the classical path exactly for T>0 [3]:\n< \u03b4 \u1ebc (z, T) >= A cos (kz \u2212 \u03c9T + \u03b3).\n\u03b4 \u1ebc is the fluctuation of \u1ebc away from flat space.\nAlthough the average value of oscillator displacement follows the\nclassical path, this is not enough to guarantee classical behavior.\nThe fluctuations around the average must also be small. For the\nusual oscillator these fluctuations are determined by \u03b4\u03b3, the uncertainty in the phase \u03b3 introduced at eq. (1). This uncertainty is\nconnected to the uncertainty\nin the number of quanta by\u221a\u03b4N\u03b4\u03b3 \u223c 1,\n\u221a\nwhich gives \u03b4\u03b3 \u223c 1/ N , since N has standard deviation N. In the\nLQG case presumably \u03b3 will be a function of the dimensionless angles (\u03b1, \u03b2) used to define the unitary matrix u, as well as the angles\ndefining the unit vector p\u0302. (\u03b3 could also be a function of a dimensionless ratio of angular momenta, (average Z component) over < L >;\nbut this ratio depends on the angles already listed.)\n\u221a The standard\ndeviations for fluctuations in the angles are order 1/ < L >. < L >\ntherefore replaces N; and for L of order 100 or so, the fluctuations\naround the classical path should be small.\n3\n\n\fB\n\nSpreading in the strong field limit\n\nOnce the self-interaction of the gravitational packet is included, it\nbecomes much harder to estimate the rate of spreading. Consider\ntwo familiar quantum mechanical examples, the free particle and\nthe simple harmonic oscillator. The spreading of the free particle\nwave packet is governed by the time scale\nTx = m(\u03c3x )2 /h\u0304,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m is the mass and \u03c3x is the standard deviation of the T = 0\nGaussian packet in configuration space. At the other extreme, the\nGaussian packet for the simple harmonic oscillator does not spread\nat all [3]. Evidently the rate of spreading is highly sensitive to the\ndetails of the energy spectrum [4].\nThe planar case, as well as the general SU(2) case, can be given\nan asymptotic region, so can have a Hamiltonian [5, 6]; and it makes\nsense to talk about energies E. If the energy eigenvalues are evenly\nspaced, resembling those of the oscillator, then the likelihood of\nspreading should be small.\nThe Hamiltonian is a surface term. I will not try to construct\nthis surface term in spin network theory, but rather will estimate it\nusing dimensional analysis. The surface term can be rewritten as a\ndensity. For example for the planar case,\nE=\n\nJ|+\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2202z J dz,\n\nand the \u2202z J can in turn be expressed in terms of other fields using\nthe classical equations of motion. One ends up with a function of\nthe \u1ebc and h. I assume this function resembles the typical terms in\nthe Euclidean Hamiltonian.\n2\nE \u223c \u01ebijk Tr(hij hk [h\u22121\nk , V] )/\u03ba .\n\n(3)\n\n(I could also use the terms in the Hamiltonian which are proportional\nto the square of the extrinsic curvature; the order of magnitude\nestimates would be the same.) I need to estimate the dependence\nof this expression on angular momentum L. The volume V contains\nthree \u1ebc operators, integrated over area, with area eigenvalues of\norder L\u03ba. Therefore volume V should be order (L\u03ba)3/2 . However,\nthe commutator of the volume with holonomy takes the derivative of\n4\n\n\fV with respect to L; see the discussion\nof the commutator in paper 2.\n\u221a\n\u22121\n3/2\nTherefore hk [hk , V ] is order L(\u03ba) . The remaining holonomies\nin the Hamiltonian give a result of order unity when acting on a\nstate. Therefore the energy grows as the square root of L.\nE\u223c\n\nq\n\n(L\u03ba)/\u03ba.\n\n(4)\n\nThis resembles the classical expression for the gravitational Hamiltonian, integral of (curvature) d3 x/\u03ba \u2243 (large length)/\u03ba, except that\nthe large length has been replaced by the square root of an area\neigenvalue. Also, the mass and event horizon area of a black hole\nare connected by a relation of similar form, mass \u221d square root of\narea.\nFor minimal spreading, the spacing between energy levels should\nbe as constant as possible, resembling the spacing between levels of\nthe usual oscillator [4]. From eq. (4) the spacing is order\n\u221a\n\u03b4E \u223c h\u0304c \u03b4L/ L\u03ba\n(5)\nI have restored factors of h\u0304 and c, and given \u03ba the dimensions of\na length. For \u03b4L = 1, define a frequency \u03c9 by\n\u221a\n(6)\nh\u0304\u03c9 := \u03b4E(\u03b4L = 1) \u223c h\u0304c/ L\u03ba.\n\nAt first glance this result is not what we want: the quantity \u03c9 is\nnot a constant, independent of L. However, \u03c9 does not need to be\na constant everywhere; it must be an approximate constant for the\nrange of L values contained in a coherent state. Over this range, the\nfractional change in \u03c9 is of order\n\u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9 = \u2212\u03b4L/(2L),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere now \u03b4L is the range of L values in the coherent state. Those\nq\nL values are Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation 1/t.\nUsing this standard deviation to estimate \u03b4L, I get\n\u221a\n(8)\n\u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9 = \u22121/(2 tL).\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the parameter t must be of order\nt \u223c 1/ < L > in order to minimize small correction terms. Inserting\nthis value into eq. (8), and replacing L by < L >, I get\n\u221a\n\u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9 \u223c \u22121/( < L >).\n(9)\n5\n\n\fEven in the strong field case, a value < L > \u2265 100 should be enough\nto drive \u03b4\u03c9 to zero and prevent spreading.\nEq. (8) is yet another reason why we cannot make t arbitrarily\nsmall: the spacing between levels would no longer be uniform over\nthe packet, leading to unacceptable spreading. It is perhaps relevant\nthat t plays the role of a standard deviation in spin network theory,\nand the time scale Tx for spreading of the free particle packet is also\nsensitive to a standard deviation, \u03c3x ; see eq. (2).\n\nIII\n\nNew Vertices in the Classical Limit\n\nIt is not immediately clear that the action of the Hamiltonian, in the\nclassical limit, involves only grasps at vertices with very high spin.\nThe Hamiltonian probably contains terms which add a new vertex\nto the spin network, a vertex which therefore involves the minimum\nspin, spin 1/2. Consider the Euclidean term in the Hamiltonian for\nconcreteness. (Since the remaining terms follow from commutators\ninvolving the Euclidean term, those terms will inherit the properties of the Euclidean term.) The spin network version of this term\ncontains the operators shown in eq. (3). Consider, for example,\nthe term hij = haz in this equation. This is a line integral of the\nholonomy along a contour with sides parallel to directions a (= x\nor y) and z. To visualize the contour, fold a rectangular sheet of\npaper into a cylinder, until the two opposite edges almost touch.\nThe contour is given by the boundary of the sheet, the two almost\ntouching edges plus the two circular ends. Align the two almost\ntouching edges with the z direction of the spin network; align the\ncircular ends with the transverse a direction. (The contours in the\ntransverse directions are always closed loops.) The contour is not\ncompletely closed. It must be opened, at one corner of the original\nsheet of paper, in order to insert the [V,h] commutator.\nThe above description is not enough to define the Hamiltonian. If\nthe spin network contains vertices v1 , v2 , . . . , vn arranged along the\nz axis, one must specify how the holonomic contour is positioned\nwith respect to these vertices. Evidently one of the circular ends,\nthe one containing the [V,h] commutator, must coincide with one of\nthe vertices, say v1 ; otherwise the volume operator in [V.h] will give\nzero. As for the other circular end, the two simplest possibilities\nare: that end coincides with the nearest neighbor, vertex v2 ; or,\n6\n\n\fthat end creates a new vertex with an associated spin 1/2 loop, at a\npoint v12 between v1 and v2 . The v12 possibility prompted our earlier\nspeculation that we might have to deal with non-classical vertices.\nThe Hamiltonian probably has to allow for both possibilities,\nboth the loop ending at v2 , and the loop ending at v12 . If the\nloop only ends at points v12 , short of v2 , then no disturbance can\npropagate along the lattice from v1 to v2 and beyond [7]. If the loop\nends only at the next, already existing vertex, v2 , then the number of\nvertices, n, is a good quantum number. This seems a bit too simple.\nFor a given fixed total length, the Hamiltonian should be able to\ncreate more vertices, with less spin per vertex, if the gravitational\nself-interaction produces excitations of shorter wavelength.\nIf the Hamiltonian can create a new, spin 1/2 vertex, then we may\nhave to deal with a highly non-classical action of the Hamiltonian,\neven in the classical limit. To investigate this possibility, I switch\nto a path integral point of view, and estimate the change in action\ncorresponding to addition of a spin 1/2 loop at v12 .\nI have to be careful which path integral I choose. In the introduction to paper 1, I discussed spin foams briefly. The spin foam\napproach is covariant, uses a path integral, and produces a satisfactory evolution operator; but it is not clear how to extract a canonical\nHamiltonian from the operator [8, 9]. If I wish to do a \"thought calculation\" involving a path integral, I must stay on the canonical side\nof the canonical/covariant divide.\nAs pointed out in the previous section, the planar case has an\nasymptotic region, therefore a genuine Hamiltonian. I use this\nHamiltonian (rather than the spin foam evolution operator) to construct a path integral.\n\u221a\nThis choice of Hamiltonian leads to an action which is order L,\nlike the Hamiltonian. Proof: the action\u221aand Hamiltonian differ by\na term (\u1ebc /\u03ba)\u0226 d3 x. This term is order L:\n(\u1ebc /\u03ba)\u0226 d3 x \u223c (\u1ebc /\u03ba)dxa dxb hc [H, h\u22121\nc ]\u01ebabc\nq\n\n\u223c L d( L/\u03ba)/dL\n\u221a\n\u223c L (1/ L\u03ba).\n\nOn the second line I have assumed that the commutator of h with\nthe Hamiltonian is a derivative with respect to L. \u2737\nThis action must be exponentiated to give a path integral, and\n7\n\n\fthe integration measure contains delta functions which enforce the\nconstraints. I assume the integration is confined to the constraint\nsurface; therefore I can ignore the ghost fields needed to exponentiate the constraints. (This is clearly a thought calculation, rather\nthan an actual calculation!) \u221a\nSince the action goes as L, the change in the action, due to a\nchange \u03b4L in spin, is\n\u03b4S/S \u223c \u03b4L/L.\n\nThe classical limit is attained by minimizing fluctuations of the action. The L in the denominator suggests that vertices involving\nsmall spins will not contribute significantly in the classical limit.\nIn the classical limit, it is plausible that results should approach\nthose obtained from field theory. Presumably this requires that\nparameters u, ~p vary slowly from vertex to vertex. (If one requires\nonly that each individual vertex is coherent, this may not be enough\nto obtain a classical limit.) A requirement of slow variation would\nagain rule out vertices with spin near 1/2.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. E. Neville, Planar Spin Network Coherent States I. General\nProperties.\n[2] D. E.
