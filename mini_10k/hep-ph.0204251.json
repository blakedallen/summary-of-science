In this talk we\ndiscuss the constraints on supersymmetry arising from these experiments. If 'recent experiments' is interpreted to include the experimental results over the past\ndecade then there is an impressive body of data which taken together can put\nimportant limits on the parameter space of supersymmetric models. Perhaps at\nthe top of the list here is the precision data on the gauge coupling constants[1]\nwhich looks very favorable for supersymmetry in that the minimal supersymmetric standard model with a low lying sparticle spectrum is in excellent accord\nwith the data within 1\u03c3-2\u03c3 (for a review see[2]). A small discrepancy that might\nexist can be easily taken account of with the help of Planck scale corrections[3].\nHowever, the gauge coupling unification does not put very stringent limits on\nthe sparticle masses or on the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter \u03bc. Constraints\non the sparticle masses and on the \u03bc parameter arise from the experiment on\nthe flavor changing neutral current process b \u2192 s + \u03b3[4,5,6]. Here one finds that\nthe sparticle spectrum is constrained and one sign of \u03bc is preferred (the positive\nsign in the standard convention[7]) and for the other \u03bc sign most of the parameter space of a class of supersymmetric models is eliminated[8,9]. Interestingly\nthe central value of the b \u2192 s + \u03b3 experiment[4,5,6] is somewhat lower than\nthe central value of its standard model prediction[10] providing a slight hint of\na supersymmetric contribution. This is so because a supersymmetric loop correction from the chargino exchange can provide a contribution with a negative\n\n\f2\n\nChattopadhyay, Corsetti, Nath\n\nsign. Another important constraint comes from the recent lower limit from the\nLEP experiment on the Higgs mass[11]. Thus before the LEP experiment closed\ndown, it was able to place a lower limit on the Higgs mass of 115 GeV for the\nStandard Model. For the supersymmetric case the lower limit is a function of\ntan \u03b2 and can be as low as about 90 GeV for large tan \u03b2. Again these lower\nlimits impose important constraints on the parameter space of supersymmetric models. Additional constraints on supersymmetric models emerge from the\ng \u2212 2 Brookhaven experiment[12]. We will discuss the g \u2212 2 experiment and its\nimplications in detail in Sec.2. One of the main results that emerges from the\nBNL data is the positivity of the \u03bc parameter which is in accord with the sign\npreferred by the b \u2192 s + \u03b3 constraint. Further, the positivity of \u03bc has important\nimplications for Yukawa coupling unification. This topic will be discussed in detail in Sec.3. One of the important features of supersymmetry is that it provides\na candidate for cold dark matter under the assumption of R parity conservation.\nThus using renormalization group a class of supergravity models lead naturally\nto the lightest neutralino to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and\nhence a candidate for dark matter[13]. Further, this class of models can produce\njust the right amount of dark matter that is indicated by the current astrophysical observations. The price one pays for generating the right amount of dark\nmatter is to further constrain the parameter space of supersymmetric models.\nThis topic will be discussed in Sec.4. Finally, we note that the SuperKamiokande\nexperiment has now reached its maximum sensitivity[14] for the detection of the\nmode p \u2192 \u03bd\u0304K + preferred by supersymmetric models and has placed a new limit\nof \u03c4 (p \u2192 \u03bd\u0304K + ) > 1.9 \u00d7 1033 yr. This result puts the minimal supersymmetric\ngrand unified models under considerable stress. We will briefly discuss this topic\nin the conclusion.\n\n2\n\ng \u2212 2 Experiment\n\nThe anomalous magnetic moment a = (g \u2212 2)/2 is an important probe of new\nphysics beyond the standard model. Typically new physics contributions to the\nanomalous moment obey al (new physics)\u223c m2l /\u039b2 where \u039b is the scale of the\nnew physics. Because of this a\u03bc is a much more sensitive probe of new physics\nthan ae . Last February the BNL experiment gave a new determination of a\u03bc\nwith a substantially lower error[12] than previous measurements. The current\nevaluation is aexp\n= 11659203(15) \u00d7 10\u221210. As of a few months ago the Standard\n\u03bc\nModel prediction consisting of the qed, electro-weak and hadronic corrections\namounted to aSM\n= 11659159.7(6.7) \u00d7 10\u221210 [15]. This gives aexp\n\u2212 aSM\n=\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u221210\n43(16) \u00d7 10\nwhich is a 2.6\u03c3 difference between theory and experiment. However, over the past few months there has been a reevaluation of the Standard\nModel prediction. This revision arises from a change in sign of the light by light\nhadronic correction. Thus previous analyses gave for ahad\n\u03bc (LbL) the value[16,17]\nhad\n\u221210\na\u03bc (LbL) = \u22128.5(2.5)\u00d7 10 . More recent evaluations[18,19] however, find the\nsign of ahad\n\u03bc (LbL) to be opposite to that of the previous determinations. Thus the\n\u221210\nanalysis of Knetch et. al gives [18] ahad\nand a follow up\n\u03bc (LbL) = 8.3(1.2) \u00d7 10\n\n\fStatus of Supersymmetry\n\n3\n\n\u221210\nanalysis by Hayakawa and Kinoshita gives[19] ahad\n. Sup\u03bc (LbL) = 8.9(1.5)\u00d710\nport for the change in sign also comes from partial analysis by Bijnens et.al[20]\n\u221210\nwhich gives ahad\nand by Blockland et.al.[21] which gives\n\u03bc (LbL) = 8.3(3.2)\u00d710\nhad\n\u221210\na\u03bc (LbL) = 5.6 \u00d7 10 . Taking the average of the first two and correcting the\nstandard model prediction one gets aSM\n= 11659176.8(6.7) \u00d7 10\u221210 . This leads\n\u03bc\nto the 1.6\u03c3 deviation between experiment and the standard model result, i.e.,\nSM\naexp\n= 26(16) \u00d7 10\u221210\n\u03bc \u2212 a\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nWe note in passing that there is no unanimity yet on the size of the light by\nlight hadronic correction. Indeed, very recently another evaluation of ahad\n\u03bc (LbL)\nbased on chiral perturbation theory was given in Ref.[22]. This analysis finds\n+5\n\u221210\nahad\nwhere \u0108 stands for corrections arising\n\u03bc (LbL) = (5.5\u22126 + 3.1\u0108) \u00d7 10\nfrom the subleading contributions. The result of Eq.(1) corresponds to a value\nof \u0108 \u223c 1. However, the authors of Ref.[22] indicate that a \u0108 range of \u22123 to 3\nor even larger is not unreasonable. In addition, to the uncertainties associated\nwith the light by light contribution, one also has the errors associated with the\nevaluation of the \u03b12 correction to the vacuum polarization. In the evaluation\nof Eq.(1) we used the \u03b12 correction to the vacuum polarization as given by\n2\n\u221210\nthe analysis of Ref.[23] which gives ahad\n.\n\u03bc (\u03b1 vac.pol.) = (692.4 \u00b1 6.2) \u00d7 10\nHowever, there are several other evaluations of this quantity[24] and this subject\nis still a topic of further investigation.\nWe discuss next the SUSY contribution to a\u03bc . The first analysis of the supersymmetric correction to a\u03bc was given soon after the development of SUGRA\n\u00b1\n\n\u03c7\u03030\n\nunified models[25]. At the one loop level one has aSUSY\n= a\u03c7\u0303\u03bc +a\u03bci . For the\n\u03bc\nCP conserving case one has that the chargino contribution is the larger one. It\nis given by[26]\n2\n\n\u00b1\na\u03c7\u0303\u03bc\n\nm2\u03bc A(a)\nm\u03bd\u0303\nR\nF1 (\n=\n2\n2\n48\u03c0 m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\na\na\n\n!2\n\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\nm\u03bd\u0303\nm\u03bc A A\n) + 2 R L F2 (\n8\u03c0\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\na\na\n\n!2\n\n)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere AL (AR ) are the left(right) chiral amplitudes. Now the chiral interference term proportional to AL AR , particularly the contribution from the lighter\nchargino term typically dominates the chargino exchange contribution. The above\namplitude contains some very interesting properties[27,28]. One finds that typically AL \u223c 1/ cos \u03b2 and because of this aSUSY\n\u223c tan \u03b2. Further, it is easy to\n\u03bc\nshow that AL depends on the sign of \u03bcm\u03032 and thus effectively the sign of aSUSY\n\u03bc\nis controlled by the sign of \u03bcm\u03032 (where we use the sign covention of Ref.[7]).\nThus one finds that typically[27,28]\naSUSY\n> 0, m\u03032 \u03bc > 0; aSUSY\n< 0, m\u03032 \u03bc < 0\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nMore recently the absolute signs of the supersymmetric contribution was\nchecked by taking the supersymmetric limit and it was shown that, as expected,\nin this limit a\u03bc (SM ) + a\u03bc (SU SY ) = 0[29].

The\nbottom patterned region near the higher m1/2 side and on the border of the white\nallowed regions are discarded because of CP-odd Higgs boson turning tachyonic at the\ntree level.\n\nSM\nwere carried out[30,31] using the result aexp\n= (43 \u00b1 16) \u00d7 10\u221210 which\n\u03bc \u2212 a\u03bc\nfound upper limits on sparticle masses well within reach of the LHC.

In view of the revised difference of Eq.(1) a new\nanalysis of the allowed parameter space in mSUGRA was carried out in Ref.[32].\nResults are displayed in Fig.1 with 1\u03c3 and 1.5\u03c3 error corridors. One finds that\nthe 1\u03c3 upper limits with the revised result are exactly the same as the 2\u03c3 upper limits of the previous analysis[30]. Specifically, in this case the squarks and\ngluinos upper limits lie below 2 TeV. Now the LHC can explore squarks/gluinos\nup to 2 TeV[33]. Thus the revised 1\u03c3 upper limits gotten from the g \u2212 2 result\nimply that sparticles should become visible at the LHC. The upper limits for the\n1.5\u03c3 case, however, are significantly larger as may be seen from Fig.1 and one\nfinds that part of the allowed parameter space lies outside the reach of the LHC.\nAn interesting aspect of the BNL data is that it determines the sign of \u03bc given\nthe sign of m\u03032 . Thus assuming CP conservation one finds that the BNL data\ndetermines the sign(\u03bcm\u03032 ) to be positive. Thus \u03bc is determined to be positive\nfor a wide class of supersymmetric models where m\u03032 is positive. Now \u03bc positive\nis favored by the b \u2192 s + \u03b3 constraint[8] and a positive \u03bc is also favorable for\nthe satisfaction of the relic density constraints. However, a positive \u03bc is typically\nnot favored by Yukawa coupling unification.

Allowed regions corresponding to 1.5\u03c3 and 1\u03c3 constraints aSU\nfor nonuniver\u03bc\nsal gaugino mass scenario of the SU(5) 24 plet case from Ref.[32]. The top gray regions\ncorrespond to disallowed areas via radiative electroweak symmetry breaking constraint.\nThe bottom patterned regions for tan \u03b2 = 5,10 and 30 are typically eliminated via the\nstability requirement of the Higgs potential at the GUT scale. Part of the region with\nlarge |c24 m1/2 | and large m0 bordering the allowed (white) region for tan\u03b2 = 30 is\neliminated via the limitation of the CP-odd Higgs boson mass turning tachyonic at the\ntree level. For tan\u03b2 = 40 most of the region (patterned and shaded) to the right of the\nallowed white small region is eliminated because of \u03bbb going to the non-perturbative\ndomain due to a large supersymmetric correction to the b quark mass.\n\nAn interesting question is the possible effect of extra dimensions on the analysis of g \u2212 2 and whether such contributions can be large enough to produce a\nsignificant background for the supersymmetric effects. This question has been\nexamined in a variety of extra dimension models[34,35]. The simplest possibility considered is a model with one extra dimension with the fifth dimension\ncompactified[34]. Specifically we consider a five dimensional model with the large\nextra dimension compactified on S 1 /Z2 with radius R (MR = 1/R = O(T eV )).\nThe spectrum of this theory contains massless modes with N=1 SUSY in 4D,\nwhich precisely form the spectrum of MSSM in 4D. In addition one has massive Kaluza-Klein modes which fall in N=2 multiplets. One of the interesting\nthings that happen in the above scenario is that the mechanism that generates\ncorrections to g \u2212 2 also generates corrections to the Fermi constant[34]. Now\nthe Standard Model prediction on GSM\nis in fairly good accord with the exF\nperimental value. Thus the contribution arising from extra dimensions must be\naccommodated within the error corridor between the experimental value of GF\nand its standard model prediction. This constrains the size of the extra dimension so that MR \u2265 3 TeV. Now large extra dimensions affect the value of a\u03bc from\ncontributions via the excitations of the W, Z, \u03b3. However, because of the fact that\nMR \u2265 3 TeV one finds that the effect of the extra dimension is numerically small,\ni.e., one finds that the corrections of the extra dimensions to a\u03bc is up to two or\n\n\f6\n\nChattopadhyay, Corsetti, Nath\n\nm0 (GeV)\n\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n3000\n0\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n\n\u03bc>0,\u03910=0\n\n(54)\ntan\u03b2=10\nMh=115 GeV\n\ntan\u03b2=5\n\n\u22121.5\u03c3\n\u22121.5\u03c3\n\u22121\u03c3\n\n\u22121\u03c3\n1\u03c3\n\ntan\u03b2=30\n\u22121.5\u03c3\nMh=115 GeV\n1\u03c3\n200\n\n\u22121.5\u03c3\nMh=115 GeV\n\u22121\u03c3\n\n\u22121\u03c3\n1.5\u03c3\n\n1\u03c3\n\n600\n\n200\n\ntan\u03b2=45\n1.5\u03c3\n\n\u2212C54*m1/2 (GeV)\n\n600\n\nSY\nFig. 3. Allowed regions corresponding to 1.5\u03c3 and 1\u03c3 constraints on aSU\nfor nonuni\u03bc\nversal gaugino mass scenario of SU(10) 54 plet case from Ref.[32]. Here the nonuniversal\nHiggs scalar parameters are given by m2H1 = 1.5m20 and m2H2 = 0.5m20 . The regions\nwith patterns are discarded for reasons similar to as in Fig.2.\n\nmore orders of magnitude smaller than the supersymmetric correction. Similar\nresults hold for the case of strong gravity extra dimension models[35] when one\nincludes the constraints on extra dimensions from the current experiment[36].\nThus for practical purposes one finds that the contribution from extra dimensions does not produce a strong background to the supersymmetric contribution.\nThe above analysis also shows that g \u2212 2 is not a sensitive probe of extra dimensions. Perhaps the most effective way to probe extra dimensions is via direct\nproduction of the Kaluza-Klein states at colliders[37,38], where Kaluza-Klein\nmasses up to 6 TeV can be probed. Another important phenomenon is the effect\nof CP violation of g \u2212 2. This was investigated in Refs[29,39]. and it was found\nthat g \u2212 2 is a sensitive function of the phases. Indeed the constraints on g \u2212 2\ncan be utilized to constrain the phases themselves. Further, if the new physics\neffect in the BNL experiment turns out to be of size \u223c 10\u22129 then this would also\nbe encouraging for the possible observation of the muon electric dipole moment\n(EDM) d\u03bc [40]. This is so because the muon anomaly is related to the real part\nand the EDM to the imaginary part of the same diagrams exchanging charginos\nand neutralinos. These results are very interesting in view of a recent proposal\nto probe d\u03bc with a sensitivity which is six orders of magnitude better than the\ncurrent sensitivity[41].\n\n3\n\nb \u2212 \u03c4 Unification and \u03bc Sign\n\nb \u2212 \u03c4 unification prefers \u03bc < 0[42,43].

A useful criterion for b \u2212 \u03c4 unification and\nmore generally for Yukawa unification are the parameters \u03b4ij = |\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj |/\u03bbij\nwhere \u03bbij = (\u03bbi + \u03bbj )/2. It is well known that b \u2212 \u03c4 unification requires a negative contribution to the b quark mass. However, from Eq.(5) one finds that the\ndominant gluino exchange contribution to \u2206b is positive for a positive \u03bc which\nis not what is preferred by the b \u2212 \u03c4 unification constraint. How to reconcile\nthe positivity of \u03bc with the Yukawa unification has been discussed in several\nrecent works[45,46,47,48]. We discuss here in some detail the scenarios where\nsuch a phenomenon arises naturally from gaugino mass nonuniversality. The basic mechanism here is rather simple. With nonuniversalities one can arrange the\ngaugino masses m\u03032 and mg\u0303 to have opposite signs which allows for consistency\nwith g \u2212 2 and b \u2212 \u03c4 unification with a positive \u03bc sign. Further such opposite\nsign correlations between m\u03032 and mg\u0303 arise naturally for certain group structures.\nWe discuss below SU(5) and SO(10) examples where the above phenomenon\nmanifests[48]. For the case of SU(5) unification the gaugino mass matrix in general transforms like the symmetric product of two adjoint representations of\nSU(5) and this product can be expanded as the sum of the representations 1,24,\n75 and 200. Of these one finds that the 24 plet component yields opposite signs\nfor the SU(2) and SU(3) gauginos. Thus one has[49]\n(24 \u00d7 24)sym = 1 + 24 + 75 + 200\nM3 : M2 : M1 = 2 : \u22123 : \u22121, 24 \u2212 plet\n\n(6)\n\nA similar situation arises for the SO(10) case. Here the gaugino mass matrix\ntransforms like the symmetric product of two adjoint representations of SO(10)\nand this product can be expanded as the sum of the representations 1,54, 210\nand 770. Of these one finds that the 54 plet component yields opposite signs\nfor the SU(2) and SU(3) gauginos. In fact in this case there are more than one\npossible ways to achieve the opposite signs for the SU(2) and SU(3) gauginos\ndepending on the pattern of symmetry breaking. Thus one has[50]\n(45 \u00d7 45)sym = 1 + 54 + 210 + 770\nM3 : M2 : M1 = 1 : \u22123/2 : \u22121 54 \u2212 plet\nM3 : M2 : M1 = 1 : \u22127/3 : 1 54\u2032 \u2212 plet\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the 54-plet and the 54\u2032 -plet correspond to two different patterns of symmetry breaking. In general the gaugino masses could be aPlinear combination of\nthe different representations such that m\u0303i (MG ) = m1/2 r Cr nri where nri are\ncharacteristic of the representation r and Cr are the relative weights. In the analysis below we will consider only one representation in the sum. Thus for SU(5)\nwe will consider the gaugino masses arising from the 24 plet representation and\n\n\f8\n\nChattopadhyay, Corsetti, Nath\n\nfor the SO(10) case we will consider the cases where the gaugino masses arise\neither from the 54 plet representation or from a 54\u2032 representation. More generally, of course, one may have linear combinations of different representations\nand the analysis given here can be extended easily to these more general cases.\nWe consider first the 24 plet case of SU(5). Here an analysis similar to that of\nFig.1 is given in Fig.2 where the regions of the parameter space allowed by the 1\u03c3\nand by the 1.5\u03c3 a\u03bc constraint is exhibited[32]. We note that the allowed regions\nare significantly modified by the presence of nonuniversalities. An interesting\nphenomenon here is that tan \u03b2 in this case does not get much beyond the value\ntan \u03b2 = 40 as the b quark Yukawa coupling gets into a nonperturbative domain\nbecause of large supersymmetric corrections to the b quark mass. A similar\nanalysis for the 54 case of SO(10) is given in Fig.3 where we give an analysis of\nthe allowed parameter space for 1\u03c3 and for the 1.5\u03c3 a\u03bc constrains. As is well\nknown for the large tan \u03b2 case of SO(10) one needs nonuniversalities of the Higgs\nscalar mass parameters at the GUT scale to accomplish radiative breaking of\nthe electroweak symmetry. In the analysis of Fig.3 we used m2H1 = 1.5m20 and\nm2H2 = 0.5m20 . The GUT boundary conditions for the above soft parameters were\nvaried (up to 50%) to test the stability of the results. It was found that there\nwas no significant change in the results as a consequence of these modifications.\nThe above scenarios produce a negative contribution to the b quark mass for \u03bc\npositive and thus lead to Yukawa unification for a positive \u03bc consistent with the\ng \u2212 2 and the b \u2192 s + \u03b3 constraints.\n\n4\n\nImplications for Dark Matter\n\nSupersymmetric dark matter and its detection has been a topic of considerable\ntheoretical investigation over the years (see Ref.[51] for an overview of dark matter and Ref.[52] for a sample of recent works on the analysis of supersymmetric\ndark matter). However, there are very few works on the study of supersymmetric\ndark matter coupled with Yukawa unification[53]. Here we investigate the implications of the positivity of the \u03bc sign and Yukawa unification for the detection\nrates in the direct detection of neutralino dark matter[32]. We focus on the scalar\ncross section\n\u03c3\u03c7p (scalar) =\n\nX p X\n2\n4\u03bc2r X p\n(\nfi Ci + (1 \u2212\nfi )\nCa )2\n\u03c0\n27\ni=u,d,s\n\ni=u,d,s\n\n(8)\n\na=c,b,t\n\nwhere fip (i=u,d,s quarks) are the quark densities defined by mp fip =< p|mqi q\u0304i qi |p >.\nThere are significant uncertainties associated with the determination of fip,n . An\nanalytical solution for fip,n can be gotten by using[54] \u03c3\u03c0N , x, and \u03be as inputs\nwhere < p|2\u22121 (mu +md )(\u016bu+ d\u0304d|p >= \u03c3\u03c0N , x = \u03c30 /\u03c3\u03c0N =< p|\u016bu+ d\u0304d\u22122s\u0304s|p >\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\n/ < p|\u016bu + dd|p\n>, and \u03be =< p|\u016bu \u2212 dd|p\n> / < p|\u016bu + dd|p\n>. In terms\nof the above variables fip are given by fup = (1 + \u03be)mu \u03c3\u03c0N /mp (mu + md ),\nfdp = (1 \u2212 \u03be)md \u03c3\u03c0N /mp (mu + md ), and similar relations hold for fin . One also\nfinds that fi p and fin satisfy the relation fup fdp = fun fdn . We use the above to give\n\n\fStatus of Supersymmetry\n\n9\n\na numerical evaluation of fip,n and its uncertainties. Using the most recent evaluation of \u03c3\u03c0N of \u03c3\u03c0N = (64\u00b19)GeV given by the SAID pion-nucleon database[55],\nx = 0.55 \u00b1 0.12, the value of \u03be given by the baryon mass splittings, i.e., by the\nformula \u03be = (\u039e \u2212 + \u039e 0 \u2212 \u03a3 + \u2212 \u03a3 \u2212 )x/(\u039e \u2212 + \u039e 0 + \u03a3 + + \u03a3 \u2212 \u2212 2mp \u2212 2mn )\nand using \u03be = 0.196x one finds \u03be = 0.108 \u00b1 0.024. Additionally using the\nquark mass ratios mu /md = 0.553 \u00b1 0.043, ms /md = 18.9 \u00b1 0.8 one finds[32]\nfup = 0.027 \u00b1 0.005, fdp = 0.038 \u00b1 0.006, fun = 0.022 \u00b1 0.004, fdn = 0.049 \u00b1 0.007,\nand fsn = fsp = 0.37 \u00b1 0.11. We use these quark densities to discuss the implications of the scenarios discussed in Sec.3 for dark matter.\n\n10\n\n24\u2212plet\n\n\u221240\n\nDAMA\n2\n\n\u03c3\u03c7p (scalar) (cm )\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n\u221241\n\n\u221242\n\nCDMS\n\u221243\n\n\u221244\n\nCDMS (future)\n\nGENIUS\n\n10\n\n\u221245\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nm\u03c7 (GeV)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFig. 4.

The sparticle spectrum including\nthe relic density constraints is discussed in Table 1. The spectrum exhibited\nin Table 1 is consistent with the criterion of naturalness (see, e.g., Ref.[57])\nand it would be interesting to discuss the possible signal such as the trileptonic\nsignal[58] that emerge from this spectrum. One may also discuss the detection\nrates for the direct detection of dark matter in these scenarios. In Fig.4 an analysis is given of the maximum and the minimum scalar cross section \u03c3\u03c7\u2212p for\nthe 24 plet case of SU(5) as a function of the the neutralino mass. The region\nof the parameter space where is signal is claimed by DAMA[59] is exhibited in\nFig.4. Also exhibited in Fig.4 are the experimental upper limits from the CDMS\nexperiment[60] and the limits that the CDMS experiment and the proposed GENIUS experiment[61] will be able to achieve in the future. The analysis of Fig.4\nshows that the future CDMS experimental limits will probe a major part of the\nparameter space of the 24 plet model, while the GENIUS detector will probe the\nentire parameter space of the 24 model. A similar analysis for the 54 plet case\nof SO(10) is given in Fig.5 with the same conclusions as for the case of Fig.4. A\nanalysis for the 54\u2032 case is given in Ref.[32].\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nSM\ndifference persists at\nWe summarize now our conclusions. First if the aexp\n\u03bc \u2212 a\u03bc\na perceptible level, i.e., at the level \u223c 10\u22129 or larger, then direct observation of\nnew physics is implied. Assuming new physics is SUSY, we expect that most of\nthe sparticles such as g\u0303, q\u0303, \u03c7\u0303\u00b1 , \u03c70 etc should become visible at the LHC. In this\npaper we also discussed the implications of a positive \u03bc implied by the BNL data.\nNow it is well known that a positive \u03bc is preferred by the b \u2192 s + \u03b3 constraint in\nthat a large part of the parameter space is allowed by this constraint for a positive\n\u03bc. Further, a positive \u03bc is beneficial for the direct search for dark matter since\na large part of the parameter space is available for the satisfaction of the relic\ndensity constraints. One downside to a positive \u03bc is that Yukawa unification\nis more difficult. However, it appears possible to overcome this problem. One\nway to accomplish this is to use nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses and\nthe analysis here shows that a simultaneous satisfaction of all the constraints,\ni.e., the g \u2212 2, b \u2192 s + \u03b3 and b \u2212 \u03c4 unification constraints is possible. Models\nof the type discussed here which satisfy these constraints typically produce a\nlow lying Higgs boson mass which can be probed at RUNII of the Tevatron.\nFurther, the sparticle spectrum of these models is typically also low lying and\ncan be fully probed at the LHC. Thus these models can also be fully tested\nvia direct detection of dark matter since a detector such as GENIUS can probe\nthe entire parameter space of these models. Finally, we wish to draw attention\nto proton decay in supersymmetric GUT models[62]. The current data from\nSuperKamiokande indicates that the minimal SUSY GUT models including the\nminimal SU(5) and SO(10) models are under stress[63,64]. The above situation\n\n\f12\n\nChattopadhyay, Corsetti, Nath\n\narises in part due to an improved value of \u03b2p [65] (the coefficient of the three quark\noperator between p and the vacuum state) and due to an increase in the lower\nlimits on the proton decay lifetime[14]. The current experimental constraint on\nthe muon anomaly further tends to destabilize the proton. Several approaches to\ncorrect the situation have been proposed recently which mostly involve dealing\nwith non-minimal models[66,67].\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grant PHY-9901057.\n\nReferences\n1.
