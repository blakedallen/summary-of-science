We study J/\u03c8 production in pp collisions at s = 1.96 and 7 TeV using\nthe Colour-Singlet Model (CSM), including next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections and\ndominant \u03b15S contributions (NNLO? ). We find that the CSM reproduces the existing data if\nthe upper range of the NNLO? is near the actual \u2013but presently unknown \u2013 NNLO. The direct\nyield polarisation for the NLO and NNLO? is increasingly longitudinal in the helicity frame\nwhen PT gets larger. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed in the literature, the prompt\nJ/\u03c8 yield polarisation in the CSM is compatible with the experimental data from the CDF\ncollaboration, when one combines the direct yield with a data-driven range for the polarisation\nof J/\u03c8 from \u03c7c .\n\n1. Introduction\nThe numerous quarkonium-production puzzles at hadron colliders were attributed not too\nlong ago to non-perturbative effects associated with channels in which the heavy quarkpair is produced in a colour-octet state [1]. \u03b14S and \u03b15S corrections to the CSM [2] are now\nwidely recognised as essential to understand the PT spectrum of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 produced in highenergy hadron collisions [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This calls for a factorised description of high-PT J/\u03c8\nbeyond leading power [8]. The effect of QCD corrections is also manifest in the polarisation\npredictions. While the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 produced inclusively or in association with a photon are\npredicted to be transversely polarised at LO, it has been found that their polarisation at NLO\nis increasingly longitudinal when PT gets larger [5, 6, 9]. In recent works [10, 11], we have\nalso shown that the CSM alone is sufficient to account for the magnitude of d\u03c3/dy at RHIC,\nTevatron and LHC energies.\nWe evaluate here the PT dependence of the J/\u03c8 yield and its polarisation at Tevatron and\nLHC energies. We describe the procedure used to obtain a first evaluation of some dominant\ncontributions at \u03b15S (NNLO? ) in addition to the yield at NLO (up to \u03b14S ). We then compare\navailable data from the Tevatron and the LHC with our results: the direct yields differential\nin PT along with the polarisation vs PT for the prompt yield using an essentially data-driven\nestimation of the polarisation for J/\u03c8 from \u03c7c .\n\n\fJ/\u03c8 production at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 1.96 and 7 TeV\n\n2\n\n2.

In order to investigate\nthe expected impact of NNLO QCD corrections for increasing PT , we also present the NLO\nresults plus the real-emission contributions at \u03b15S evaluated along the lines of [6], referred\nto as NNLO? . At \u03b15S , the last\u2021 kinematically-enhanced topologies open up, with a P\u22124\nT fall\noff of d\u03c3/dP2T . The procedure used here for the NNLO? is exactly that of [6]: the realemission contributions at \u03b15S are evaluated using MADONIA [12] by imposing a lower bound\non the invariant-mass squared of any light partons (si j ). The dependence on this cut should\ndecrease for larger PT since no collinear or soft divergences can appear there for the new\nchannels opening up at \u03b15S with a leading-PT behaviour, i.e. the ones which interest us. For\nother channels, whose Born contribution is at \u03b13S or \u03b14S , the cut would produce logarithms\nof si j /smin\ni j . These are not necessarily small, but they are expected to be factorised over their\n\u22126\ncorresponding Born contribution, which scales as P\u22128\nT or PT . They are thus suppressed by at\nleast two powers of PT with respect of the leading-PT contributions (P\u22124\nT ). The sensitivity on\nmin\nsi j is expected to be small at large PT .\n\n0\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\nPT (GeV)\n\ndirect\nFJ/\u03c8\n= 64 +/- 6 %\n\n0.01\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nPT (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: d\u03c3/dPT \u00d7 Br for direct J/\u03c8 production from NLO and NNLO? CS contributions at\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns = 1.96 TeV (left) and at s = 7 TeV for central (middle) and forward (right) rapidities.\nThese are compared to the CDF [14], ATLAS, CMS and LHCb data [15, 16, 17] multiplied\nby a constant direct fraction from CDF [18]. See text for details on theoretical-error bands.\nOur results are shown on Fig. 1. The CSM is very close to the existing data, if\nthe upper range of the NNLO? is a relevant evaluation of the NNLO. The uncertainty\nbands at NLO are obtained from the combined variations of the charm-quark mass (mc =\n1.5 \u00b1 0.1 GeV), the factorisation \u03bcF and the renormalisation \u03bcR scales chosen in the couples\n((0.75, 0.75); (1, 1); (1, 2); (2, 1); (2, 2)) \u00d7 mT with m2T = 4m2Q + P2T . The band for the NNLO?\nis obtained using a combined variation of mc , 0.5mT < \u03bcR = \u03bcF < 2mT and 2.25 < smin\ni j < 9.00\n2\n2\nGeV . We have used the NLO set CTEQ6 M [13] and have taken |R J/\u03c8 (0)| = 1.01 GeV3 and\nBr(J/\u03c8 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 ) = 0.0594.\n\u2021 We do not expect any further kinematical enhancement as regards the PT dependence when going further\n5\nin the \u03b1S expansion: P\u22124\nT is the slowest possible fall-off. Above \u03b1S , usual expectations for the impact of QCD\ncorrections would then hold. One would expect a K factor multiplying the yield at NNLO accuracy, which would\nbe independent of PT and of a similar size as those of other QCD processes. A further enhancement by an order\nof magnitude between the NNLO and N3 LO results would be quite worrisome.\n\n\fJ/\u03c8 production at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 1.96 and 7 TeV\n\n3\n\n3. Polarisation\n\n\u03b1 =(\u03c3T-2\u03c3L)/(\u03c3T+2\u03c3L)\n\nThe polarisation parameter \u03b1 is extracted bin by bin in y or PT from the normalised distribution\nof the polar angle \u03b8 between the `+ direction in the J/\u03c8 rest frame and its direction in the\n3\n(1 + \u03b1 cos2 \u03b8). We thus work in the helicity frame. \u03b1 is also\nlaboratory frame, I(cos \u03b8) = 2(\u03b1+3)\n\u22122\u03c3L\nrelated to a ratio of the polarised cross sections: \u03b1 = \u03c3\u03c3TT +2\u03c3\n.\nL\nFor the time being, there does not exist any measurement of direct J/\u03c8 polarisation,\ni.e. after the extraction of the \u03c7c feed-downs (up to 30-40 %) which may strongly impact on\nthe observed values of \u03b1. It is however possible to constrain its effects by using existing data\non \u03c3\u03c7c1 /\u03c3\u03c7c2 and by relying on E1 dominance for the transition \u03c7c \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03b3.\nIndeed, using E1 dominance [19], one can obtain [21] a range of the yield of\nlongitudinally (transversely) polarised J/\u03c8 in terms of simple relations involving the polarised\n\u03c7c yields. Allowing for extreme cases, these relations allow the yield from \u03c7c to be fully\ntransversely polarised, while there is a minimal value of \u03b1. Following the discussion of [21]\n\u03c3\u03c7 Br(\u03c7c1 \u2192J/\u03c8\u03b3)\nand taking R12 = \u03c3\u03c7c1 Br(\u03c7c2 \u2192J/\u03c8\u03b3) = 2.5 \u00b1 0.1[20], one obtains \u03b1min\nfrom \u03c7c ' \u22120.42, rather different\nc2\nthan -1.\n1\n\nPrompt J/\u03c8 CDF data at s1/2=1.96 TeV\nNLO direct\n\u2605\nNNLO prompt\n\u2605\nNNLO direct\n\n0.5\n0\n\n-0.5\n-1\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nPT (GeV)\n\n\u221a\nFigure 2: Comparison between the extrapolation of \u03b1 for prompt J/\u03c8 in pp at s = 1.96 TeV\n(red band), the direct NLO \u03b1 (gray line), the direct NNLO? \u03b1 (thinner dark-red band) and the\nCDF data [22] for prompt J/\u03c8.\nSince 30% of the J/\u03c8 come from \u03c7c nearly independent of PT in the range considered\nhere [18], we expect a partial contribution to the polarisation ranging from 0.3 \u00d7 (+1) to\n0.3 \u00d7 (\u22120.42). Regarding the other 70%, one multiplies the result for the direct yields by\n0.7, since the polarisation of J/\u03c8 from \u03c8(2S ) is expected to be identical to the direct one.\nDoing so, one obtains the extrapolation shown on Fig. 2. If the J/\u03c8 from \u03c7c yield is strongly\ntransversely polarised (the upper limit), the polarisation of the prompt yield is in rather good\nagreement with the data.\n4. Conclusion\nWe have evaluated the NLO and NNLO? J/\u03c8 yield at Tevatron and LHC energies. As found\nfor \u03a5 at the Tevatron [6] and for J/\u03c8 at RHIC [21], the upper bound of the CSM predictions\nis very close to the experimental data from CDF, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. However, the\n\n\fJ/\u03c8 production at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 1.96 and 7 TeV\n\n4\n\nNNLO? evaluation is not a complete NNLO calculation. It is affected by logs of an IR cutoff whose effect might not vanish as quickly as one has anticipated. It may very well be\nthat the upper limit of the prediction \u2013close to the data\u2013 accurately reproduces the complete\nNNLO yield, or that the lower limit \u2013close to the NLO yield\u2013 reproduces the NNLO yield. If\nthe upper limit of the NNLO? does indeed overestimate the NNLO, the CSM alone is likely\ninsufficient to account for the data. Conversely, the CSM alone is enough and the colour-octet\ncontributions are not required.\nAs regards polarisation, we have derived a range for the prompt yield polarisation.\nThis range is affected by admittedly large theoretical uncertainties, but the upper edge \u2013\ncorresponding to a transversely polarised feed-down\u2013 is in rather good agreement with the\ndata from the Tevatron. We recall that the trend for a longitudinally (direct) \u03c8(2S ) yield [22]\nwas also met by the NNLO? [7].\nIn conclusion, the CSM may very well provide a good description of J/\u03c8 production in\nhigh-energy pp collisions, both in terms of the cross section and the yield polarisation.\nAcknowledgments We thank P.
