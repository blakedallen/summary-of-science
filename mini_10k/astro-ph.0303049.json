These masks provide the required\n10\u221210 level of contrast to within 4\u03bb/D, and in some cases 3\u03bb/D, of the central\npoint, which is deemed necessary for exo-solar planet finding/imaging.

To this end,\nNASA is planning to launch a space-based telescope, called the Terrestrial Planet Finder\n(TPF), sometime in the middle of the next decade. This telescope, which will ultimately\nbe either an interferometer or a coronagraph, will be specifically designed for high-contrast\nimaging. Earlier studies (Brown et al. (2002)) indicate that a 4m class coronagraph ought\nto be able to discover about 50 extrasolar Earth-like planets if the telescope can provide\ncontrast of 10\u221210 at a separation of 3\u03bb/D and that a 4 \u00d7 10m class telescope ought to be\nable to discover about 150 such planets if it can provide the same contrast at a separation\nof 4\u03bb/D.\nOne of the most promising design concepts for high-contrast imaging is to use pupil\nmasks for diffraction control. So far, work in this direction (see Kasdin et al. (2002a); Brown\net al. (2002); Spergel (2000); Kasdin et al. (2002b, 2003)) has focused on optimizing masks\nthat are not rotationally symmetric and thus provide the desired contrast only in a narrow\nannular sector around a star, but at fairly high throughput. A full investigation of a given\nstar then requires multiple images where the mask is rotated between the images so as to\nultimately image all around the star. In this paper, we propose a new class of rotationally\nsymmetric pupil masks, which are attractive because they do not require rotation to image\naround a star. Such masks consist of concentric rings. As we show, they can provide the\ndesired contrast with a reasonable amount of light throughput. However, it is not clear a\npriori how to support a concentric-ring mask. While the simplest mechanism would be to\nlay the rings on a glass plate, even a tiny amount of scatter from the glass could destroy the\nhigh contrast. It is better to use an opaque structure for support, maintaining the purely\nbinary nature of the mask. We show here that a certain type of spider support can be used\nwithout adversely affecting the contrast in the desired working range.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we show how to design highcontrast concentric-ring masks as a two-step optimization process. The first step is to solve a\nlinear programming problem for an optimal apodization. The second step exploits the \"bang\u2013\nbang\" nature of the optimal apodization to create a starting point for a local nonlinear search\nfor an optimal mask. With masks in hand, Section 3 is devoted to considering the impact of\nsupport spiders on the point spread function and in particular on finding spiders that preserve\nthe high-contrast region. Finally, we discuss how to design masks with central obstructions.\nSuch masks, with their spiders, could be useful for telescopes with on-axis designs such as\nNGST and a variety of ground-based telescopes. For these, the mask's spiders could be used\nto block the spiders supporting the secondary.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nConcentric-Ring Masks\n\nThe image-plane electric field produced by an on-axis point source\nand an apodized\np\n2\naperture defined by a circularly-symmetric apodization function A( x + y 2 ) is given by\nZZ\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u22122\u03c0i(x\u03be+y\u03b6)\n2\n2\nx + y dxdy,\nE(\u03be, \u03b6) =\ne\nA\n(1)\nS\n\nwhere\nS = {(x, y) : 0 \u2264 r(x, y) \u2264 1/2, \u03b8(x, y) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]} ,\n\n(2)\n\nand r(x, y) and \u03b8(x, y) denote the polar coordinates associated with point (x, y). Here, and\nthroughout the paper, x and y denote coordinates in the pupil plane measured in units of the\naperature D and \u03be and \u03b6 denote angular (radian) deviation from on-axis measured in units\nof wavelength over aperture (\u03bb/D) or, equivalently, physical distance in the image plane\nmeasured in units of focal-length times wavelength over aperture (f \u03bb/D). If the apodization\nfunction A() takes only the values 0 and 1, then the apodization can be realized as an\naperture mask.\nFor circularly-symmetric apodizations and masks, it is convenient to work in polar\ncoordinates. To this end, let r and \u03b8 denote polar coordinates in the pupil plane and let \u03c1\nand \u03c6 denote the image plane coordinates:\nx = r cos \u03b8\ny = r sin \u03b8\n\n\u03be = \u03c1 cos \u03c6\n\u03b6 = \u03c1 sin \u03c6.\n\n(3)\n\nHence,\nx\u03be + y\u03b6 = r\u03c1(cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 + sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)\n= r\u03c1 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6).\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nThe electric field in polar coordinates depends only on \u03c1 and is given by\nE(\u03c1) =\n\nZ1/2Z2\u03c0\n0\n\ne\u22122\u03c0ir\u03c1 cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03c6) A(r)rd\u03b8dr,\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nZ1/2\n= 2\u03c0 J0 (2\u03c0r\u03c1)A(r)rdr,\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nwhere J0 denotes the 0-th order Bessel function of the first kind. Note that the mapping\nfrom apodization function A to electric field E is linear. Furthermore, the electric field in\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe image plane is real-valued (because of symmetry) and its value at \u03c1 = 0 is the throughput\nof the apodization:\nZ1/2\n(8)\nE(0) = 2\u03c0 A(r)rdr.\n0\n\nThe point spread function (psf) is the square of the electric field. The contrast requirement is that the psf in the dark region be 10\u221210 of what it is at its center. Because the\nelectric field is real-valued, it is convenient to express the contrast requirement in terms of\nit rather than the psf, resulting in a field requirement of \u00b110\u22125 .\nThe apodized pupil that maximizes throughput subject to contrast constraints can be\nformulated as an infinite dimensional linear programming problem:\nmaximize\nsubject to\n\nE(0)\n\u221210\u22125 E(0) \u2264 E(\u03c1) \u2264 10\u22125 E(0),\n0 \u2264 A(r) \u2264 1,\n\n\u03c1iwd \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1owd ,\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 1/2,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c1iwd denotes a fixed inner working distance and \u03c1owd a fixed outer working distance.\nDiscretizing the sets of r's and \u03c1's and replacing the integrals with their Riemann sums, the\nproblem is approximated by a finite dimensional linear programming problem that can be\nsolved to a high level of precision (see, e.g., Vanderbei (2001)).\nThe solution obtained for \u03c1iwd = 4 and \u03c1owd = 60 is shown in Figure 1. Note that the\nsolution is of a bang-bang type. That is, the apodization function is mostly 0 or 1 valued.\nThis suggests looking for a mask that is about as good as this apodization. Such a mask can\nbe found by solving the following nonlinear optimization problem. A mask consists of a set\nof concentric opaque rings, formulated in terms of the inner and outer radii of the openings\nbetween the rings:\n[r0 , r1 ]\n\nfirst opening\n\n(10)\n\n[r2 , r3 ]\n\nsecond opening\n\n(11)\n\nthird opening\n\n(12)\n\n[r4 , r5 ]\n..\n.\n[r2m\u22122 , r2m\u22121 ]\n\n(13)\nm-th opening\n\n(14)\n\nWith this notation, the formula for E(\u03c1) given in (7) can be rewritten as a sum of integrals\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nover these openings:\nE(\u03c1) = 2\u03c0\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nrZ\n2k+1\n\nJ0 (2\u03c0r\u03c1)rdr,\n\n(15)\n\nk=0 r\n2k\n\n=\n\nm\u22121\n1X\n(r2k+1 J1 (2\u03c0r2k+1 \u03c1) \u2212 r2k J1 (2\u03c0r2k \u03c1))\n\u03c1 k=0\n\n(16)\n\nTreating the rk 's as variables and using this new expression for the electric field, the mask\ndesign problem becomes:\nm\u22121\nX\n\n2\n2\nr2k+1\n\u2212 r2k\n\n\u0001\n\nmaximize\n\n\u03c0\n\nsubject to\n\n\u221210\u22125 E(0) \u2264 E(\u03c1) \u2264 10\u22125 E(0),\n0 \u2264 r0 \u2264 r1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 r2m\u22121 \u2264 1/2.\n\nk=0\n\n\u03c1iwd \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1owd ,\n\n(17)\n\nThis problem is a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem and hence the best hope for\nsolving it in a reasonable amount of cpu time is to use a \"local-search\" method starting\nthe search from a solution that is close to optimal. The bang-bang solution from the linear\nprogramming problem can be used to generate a starting solution. Indeed, the discrete\nsolution to the linear programming problem can be used to find the inflection points of A\nwhich can be used as initial guesses for the rk 's. The particular local-search method we used\nis the first-author's loqo optimizer, which is described in Vanderbei (1999). Figures 2 and\n4 show optimal concentric-ring masks computed using an inner working distance of 4 and\ntwo different choices of outer working distances (40 and 60).\nThere is great interest in decreasing the inner working distance as this rapidly increases\nthe number of possible planets one could discover via TPF. Or, put another way, it allows one\nto study the same set of targets but with a smaller aperture instrument. Using \u03c1iwd = 3.5,\nwe first tried to solve the linear programming problem with \u03c1owd = 10. There is no solution.\nWe next tried \u03c1owd = 7 and found a solution to both the linear and nonlinear optimization\nproblems. The resulting mask is shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 7 shows a mask with \u03c1iwd = 3 and \u03c1owd = 4.8. The linear program with \u03c1owd = 5.0\nis infeasible. We have even created a mask with \u03c1iwd = 2.5 and \u03c1owd = 3.1. In the interest\nof space, we don't show this last mask.\nOf course, the obvious issue is ring support. How can the rings be supported without\ncompromising the high-contrast area of the psf, without significantly reducing throughput,\nand without using glass which would introduce unacceptable scatter? The simplest answer is\nto use a \"spider\" similar to those used, for example, to support a secondary mirror. However,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nspiders create diffraction spikes which can destroy the high-contrast. In the next section, we\ninvestigate the effect of spiders and show how to make them in such a way as to preserve\nhigh-contrast.\n\n3.\n\nUsing Spiders for Support\n\nIn this section, we study the impact that ring-connecting spiders have on the masks\ncomputed in the previous section. Normally, one thinks of a spider as a uniform-width\nsupport piece used to hang things. However, there is no specific need that these supports\nbe of uniform width. In fact, since the masks will be made by electroforming technology,\nsuch a restriction to uniform width is completely unnecessary. Instead of constant-width\nspiders, we study constant-angular-width spiders. That is, each spider vane is a narrow\nsector, starting from a point at the center and flaring out with radius. Incorporating N such\nspiders uniformly spaced, the electric field, expressed in polar coordinates, is given by\nZZ\nE(\u03c1, \u03c6) =\ne\u22122\u03c0ir\u03c1 cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03c6) A(r)rdrd\u03b8\n(18)\nS\n\nwhere\nA(r) =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\n1[r2k ,r2k+1 ] (r),\n\n(19)\n\nk=0\n\nS = {(x, y) : 0 \u2264 r(x, y) \u2264 1/2, \u03b8(x, y) \u2208 \u0398} ,\n\u0015\nN\n\u22121 \u0014\n[\n2\u03c0n \u03b1 2\u03c0(n + 1) \u03b1\n\u0398=\n,\n+ ,\n\u2212\nN\n2\nN\n2\nn=0\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\n\u03b1 denotes the width of a vane in radians, the notation [a, b] denotes the interval on the real\nline from a to b, and the notation 1[a,b] denotes the function that is one on the interval [a, b]\nand zero elsewhere.\nThe integral in equation (18) can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions using the\nJacobi-Anger expansion (see, e.g., Arfken and Weber (2000) p. 681):\nix cos \u03b8\n\ne\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nim Jm (x)eim\u03b8 .\n\n(22)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSubstituting into (18), we get:\nZZ X\nE(\u03c1, \u03c6) =\nim Jm (\u22122\u03c0r\u03c1)eim(\u03b8\u2212\u03c6) A(r)rdrd\u03b8\nm\n\nS\n\nZ1/2X\n\n=\n\n(23)\n\nm\n\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ\nim Jm (\u22122\u03c0r\u03c1)e\u2212im\u03c6 \uf8ed eim\u03b8 d\u03b8\uf8f8 A(r)rdr\n\n(24)\n\n\u0398\n\nThe integral over \u0398 is easy to compute:\nZ\n\nim\u03b8\n\ne\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nd\u03b8 =\n\n2\u03c0(n+1)\n\u2212\u03b1\nN\n2\n\nn=0\n\n\u0398\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0n\n\neim\u03b8 d\u03b8\n\n(25)\n\n+\u03b1\n\nN\n2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 2\u03c0 \u2212 N\u03b1\n\u2212 2j sin(jN \u03b12 )\n=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 0\n\nm=0\nm = jN, j 6= 0\notherwise.\n\n(26)\n\nSubstituting this result into (18), yields\n\nZ1/2\nJ0 (\u22122\u03c0r\u03c1)(2\u03c0 \u2212 N\u03b1)A(r)rdr\nE(\u03c1, \u03c6) =\n\n(27)\n\n0\n\n1/2\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n\u03b1\nijN JjN (\u22122\u03c0r\u03c1)e\u2212ijN \u03c6 sin(jN )A(r)rdr.\nj\n2\n\nXZ\nj6=0 0\n\n(28)\n\nLastly, suppose that N is even and use the fact that J\u2212m (x) = Jm (\u2212x) = (\u22121)m Jm (x) to\nget the following expansion for the electric field:\nZ1/2\nE(\u03c1, \u03c6) = (2\u03c0 \u2212 N\u03b1) J0 (2\u03c0r\u03c1)A(r)rdr\n\n(29)\n\nZ1/2\n\n(30)\n\n0\n\n\u22124\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj=1 0\n\n\u03b1\n1\nJjN (2\u03c0r\u03c1) cos(jN(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0/2)) sin(jN )A(r)rdr.\nj\n2\n\nThe first term, involving the integral of J0 , is identical, up to a constant factor, to the\nformula for the electric field in the absence of spiders. Hence, the impact of the spiders is\ntwo-fold: (a) the original electric field is reduced by 1 \u2212 N\u03b1/(2\u03c0) which is just the fraction\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof the open area that remains uncovered by the spiders, and (b) there are additional terms\ncontaining higher order Bessel functions.\nFor large N,pthe effect of the higher-order Bessel terms becomes negligible for small \u03c1.\nIndeed, for x \u2264 4(m + 1),\n(x/2)m+1\n0 \u2264 Jm (x) \u2264\n,\n(31)\n(m + 1)!\n(which itself follows easily from the alternating Taylor series expansion of the m-th Bessel\nP\nl\n2l+m\nfunction: Jm (x) = \u221e\n/(l!(m+l)!)). From this we use the Schwarz inequality\nl=0 (\u22121) (x/2)\nto estimate the magnitude of the effect of the spiders:\n1/2\n\n4\n\n\u221e Z\nX\nj=1 0\n\n1\n\u03b1\nJjN (2\u03c0r\u03c1) cos(jN(\u03c6 \u2212\u03c0/2)) sin(jN )A(r)rdr\nj\n2\n\u221e\n\n1X\nJjN (\u03c0\u03c1owd )\n\u2264\n2 j=1\n\u221e\n\u0010 \u03c0\u03c1 \u0011jN +1\n1X\n1\nowd\n\u2264\n,\n2 j=1 (jN + 1)!\n2\n\n(32)\n\np\nfor \u03c1owd \u2264 4(N + 1)/\u03c0. Since the last bound is dominated by e\u03c0\u03c1owd /2 /2, it follows from\nthe dominated convergence theorem that this last bound tends to zero as N tends to infinity.\nThe convergence to zero of the terms in the sum on j is very fast. In fact, if N is set\nlarge enough that max0\u2264x\u2264\u03c0\u03c1owd JN (x) \u2264 10\u22125 , then the j = 1 term dominates the sum of\nall the higher-order terms and is itself dominated by the J0 term. Figure 9 shows a plot of\nJ50 , J100 , and J150 . These three Bessel functions first reach 10\u22125 at 35.2, 81.0, and 128.1,\nrespectively.\nFigure 3 shows the psf for the mask designed with \u03c1iwd = 4 and \u03c1owd = 60 and three\ndifferent spider configurations. The configuration consisting of 180 spiders each spanning\n0.0025 radians completely preserves the full high-contrast region. Note that this spider fills,\nin total, 180 \u00d7 0.0025 = 0.45 radians, which is 7.2% of the open area.\nFigure 5 shows the psf for the mask designed with \u03c1iwd = 4 and \u03c1owd = 40 and three\ndifferent spider configurations. The configuration consisting of 120 spiders each spanning\n0.003 radians completely preserves the full high-contrast region. Note that this spider fills,\nin total, 120 \u00d7 0.003 = 0.36 radians, which is 5.7% of the open area.\nFor the mask designed with \u03c1iwd = 3.5 and \u03c1owd = 7 (shown in Figure 6), 50 spider vanes\nsuffice to preserve the high-contrast of the dark zone. The resulting psf is indistinguishable\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nfrom the one shown in Figure 6. If each spider spans 0.01 radians then they fill, in total,\n50 \u00d7 0.01 = 0.5 radians, which is 8.0% of the open area.\nFor the mask designed with \u03c1iwd = 3.0 and \u03c1owd = 4.8 (shown in Figure 7), again 50\nspider vanes suffice to preserve the high-contrast of the dark zone and the resulting psf is\nindistinguishable from the one shown in the earlier figure.\nNone of the masks presented have a central obstruction. Hence, there are many spiders\nall coming to a point at the center. This central area is probably the hardest part of the mask\nto manufacture. One probably needs to add a small bead at the center as an attachment\npoint for the spiders. Using the same inner and outer working distances (3.0 and 4.8) as for\nthe mask in Figure 7, we experimented with adding a constraint to the optimization problem\nthat forces there to be a small central obstruction. In the nonlinear optimization model, the\nconstraint simply amounts to fixing r0 to a specified small value. We tried several values and\nfound that we could fix r0 to 0.01 (i.e., a 2% obstruction) and still find an optimal solution\nwith essentially an unchanged throughput.\nIt is a trivial matter to make designs with larger central obstructions to accomodate,\nsay, a secondary mirror in an on-axis design. However, once the central obstruction becomes\nlarge, one loses the ability to get tight inner working distances. Figure 8 shows a design\nfor a 31% central obstruction, an inner working distance of \u03c1iwd = 10 and an outer working\ndistance of \u03c1owd = 40. With \u03c1iwd = 9, the linear optimization problem has a solution but not\nthe nonlinear one. With \u03c1iwd = 8, not even the linear optimization problem has a solution.\nSome TPF concepts involve an elliptical pupil geometry since this might provide a means\nto achieve improved angular resolution in realizable rocket fairings. The designs presented\nin this paper are given in unitless variables. When re-unitizing, a different scale can be used\nfor the x and y directions. In this way, these designs can be applied directly to elliptical\npupils. Of course, the high-contrast region of the psf will also be elliptical with the short\naxis of the psf corresponding to the long axis of the pupil.\n\n4.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nThere are two parts to TPF: discovery and characterization. Discovery refers to the\nsimple act of looking for exosolar planets. Characterization refers to the process of learning\nas much as possible about specific planets after they have been discovered. The masks\npresented here are intended primarily for discovery since a single exposure with these masks\ncan discover a planet in any orientation relative to its star. However, once a planet is found\nand its orientation is known, some of the asymmetric masks presented in previous papers will\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbe used for photometry and spectroscopy as they have higher single-exposure throughput.\nAn alternative to pupil masks is to use a traditional coronagraph, which consists of an\nimage plane mask followed by a Lyot stop in a reimaged pupil plane. Recently, Kuchner and\nTraub (2002) have developed band-limited image-plane masks that achieve the desired contrast to within 3\u03bb/D. However, this approach suffers from sensitivity to pointing accuracy.\nNonetheless, the approach is promising. In the future, we plan to consider combining pupil\nmasks with image masks and Lyot stops to make a hybrid design that hopefully will provide\na design achieving the desired contrast with an even smaller inner working distance.\nIn this paper we have only considered scalar electric fields. We leave the important and\nmore complex issue of how to treat vector electric fields, i.e. polarized light, to future work.\nAcknowledgements.
