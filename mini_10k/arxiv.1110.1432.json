Due to the harmful environment\ncaused by the release of the explosive chemicals, non-destructive spectroscopic techniques are typically used to record the optical spectrum without interfering with the\nsamples. Ideally, a standoff detection is performed to acquire the spectral information. Then a search and matching procedure through a prepared spectral database\nwill be carried out for identification. However such an approach would be unsuccessful if the explosives contained chemical compounds outside of the database, which is\nhighly likely as hidden explosives are often unknown a-priori. In general, the samples\nmay involve multiple unknown substances besides impurities. Conventional analysis\nroutines are mostly based on least squares fitting whose residuals could remain mysterious. Further analysis calls for the development of blind identification methods to\nextract major components from the residuals.\nVarious recent experimental techniques (see [3, 6, 7] and the references therein)\ncan identify pure chemicals with notable success. These methods are mainly based on\nRaman spectroscopy, a spectroscopic technique to study the chemical composition of\nthe samples [12, 21]. Combined with other spectroscopic techniques such as Ultraviolet and Infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy has been widely used in materials\nscience, biosciences, geosciences (gemology), forensic sciences, nano-technology, and\npharmaceutical chemistry [3, 4, 5, 7, 13, 15, 17, 23]. For example, the Swept Wavelength Optical Resonant Raman Detector (SWOrRD) at the Naval Research Laboratory developed in 2009 can generate two dimensional spectral maps of biological\nagents and chemical substances. The resultant two dimensional signatures contain\nmuch more information than the single illumination wavelengths, which may result in\na greater likelihood of successful identification even in complex mixtures [3, 7]. Raman spectroscopy is based on Raman scattering, an inelastic scattering process that\nshifts the frequencis of the incident photons. During the interaction of the incident\nlight with a molecule, a scattered light of lower (Stokes Raman) or higher (anti-Stokes\nRaman) energy is emitted, allowing the measurements of the molecule's vibrational\nmodes. The appeals of this technique are non-destructiveness and fast sensing capability. It has become a promising tool for standoff distance detection for explosives at\nairports among other transportation centers.\nIn general, Raman spectra of a sample are composed of many substances, and\nthey must be identified by an analysis software. If one has the complete knowledge of\nthe kinds of substances in the sample, the least squares fitting can be used to retrieve\ntheir concentrations (or volumes) by a linear combination of the known spectra on a\ntemplate. In most practical situations, one may have to identify the substances and\nquantify their concentrations at the same time. This becomes a blind source separation (BSS) problem, or recovering pure signal sources from their mixtures without a\ndetailed knowledge of the mixing process. There have been several studies on the BSS\nof Raman spectra [11, 16] based on independent component analysis (ICA, [9]) and\nnonnegative matrix factorization (NMF, [10]). However these methods are non-convex\nand too general to be robust and reliable in real-world applications. The independence\nhypothesis of ICA does not hold if chemicals share some common structures and have\n1\n\n\fcorrelated Raman spectral line shapes. Moreover, these existing approaches do not\naddress how to identify unknown substances from the fitting residuals when partial\nknowledge of the source signals is available. Such a semi-blind problem is more often\nencountered in applications and of great importance to practitioners.\nIn this paper, we shall develop a convex semi-blind source separation method\nbased on sparsity of the source spectra. We are concerned with the regime where\nthe sample contains some known and some unknown components. In other words, we\nhave knowledge of some of the components and their concentrations, which is the case\nof the SWOrRD data.. We further assume that the upper bound of the concentrations\nof the known substances is available, say from experiments or prior knowledge, as is\nthe case of SWOrRD data. Though our method here is designed for Raman spectra,\nit is applicable to spectra with similar line shapes, such as nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) data, see [18, 19] where more general sparseness source conditions and postprocessing methods have been studied. A similar semi-blind source identification\napproach has been developed for mysterious species of the atmospheric gas mixtures\n[20].\nOur method in the paper may provide an assistive tool for practitioners to analyze\nthe hidden structures from residuals of fitting complicated mixtures. The method\ncontains two major steps. The first step decomposes Raman data X into a linear\ncombination of the reference spectra (known components) plus a remainder, or X =\nA S + R, where the columns of matrix A are known reference spectra, the matrix S\ncontains the non-negative concentrations and has known upper bound. The first step\nis carried out by solving a constrained least squares problem. The constraints on S\nhelp to maintain the nonnegativity of remainder matrix R. The second step performs a\nnonnegative blind source separation of the remainder matrix R to extract the unknown\ncomponents. We show that proper sparsity of source signals reduces the general nonconvex problem to constrained convex programming permitting solutions with better\nmathematical properties. Sparse solutions to convex objectives are achieved through\nl1 norm minimization and a fast iterative method (the linearized Bregman). The two\nsteps may be iterated. If some of the components from step two are confirmed as\nchemically meaningful, they are fed back to step one to refine the residual for further\nextraction of hidden components in step 2.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the source sparseness\ncondition and our method. In section 3, we illustrate the proposed method in processing a set of SWorRD experimental data, and show satisfactory numerical results.\nConclusion and future works are discussed in section 4.\nThis work was partially supported by NSF-ADT grant DMS-0911277. The authors\nthank Naval Research Laboratory for the experimental Raman data and Dr. J. Grun\nfor helpful discussions.\n\n2\n\nThe method\n\nIn this section, we shall present our method for chemicals detection in Raman spectroscopy. Based on the assumption that part of the substances in the chemical mixture\n2\n\n\fand the upper bounds of their concentrations are known, the first step of the method\nfits these known chemicals to the mixtures. This step solves a constrained least squares\noptimization.\n\n2.1\n\nConstrained least squares\n\nThe following linear model is used for Raman spectra of mixtures\nX = A S + R,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the columns of matrix X are the measured Raman data, the columns of A\ncontain reference spectra of the known chemicals, and those of S matrix contains\ntheir concentrations. Matrix R is the fitting residual which might contain hidden\nspectral structures, the instrument noise, etc. Matrix S is nonnegative on physical\nground that its entries represent concentrations. Furthermore, the upper bound of S\nis known a priori. Then for the estimation of S, we minimize the following constrained\nobjective function:\nmin kX \u2212 A Sk22 , s.t. 0 \u2264 S \u2264 c,\n(2.2)\nS\n\nwhere the vector c contains the upper bounds of the concentrations of the known\nsubstances in the sample. For the Raman data in our numerical experiments, we found\nthat the linear constraint in (2.2) helps to maintain a nonnegative remainder R = X \u2212\nA S. In the residual R, there might be spectral structures (one or many) of chemicals\nburied in noise, or just random noise. In either case, we factorize the residuals in a\nblind fashion due to the lack of knowledge of the hidden components. Conventional\nblind source separation methods such as NMF and ICA are non-convex optimization\nmethods. These methods are for general purpose, yet often unreliable in real-world\napplications due to non-convexity or sensitivity of their working assumptions. For\nour problem, we show that proper sparsity of source signals reduces the general nonconvex problem to constrained convex programming permitting solutions with better\nmathematical properties. Sparse solutions to convex objectives are achieved through\nl1 minimization.\n\n2.2\n\nConvex blind source separation\n\nThe remainder matrix R is factorized as:\nR = W M,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the columns of the matrix W are the identified substances, M is their concentrations in the sample. All the matrices are nonnegative. For the purpose of\nillustration, we shall call W \u2208 Rp\u00d7n the source matrix, M \u2208 Rn\u00d7m the mixing matrix. The dimensions of the matrices are expressed in terms of three numbers: (1)\np the number of available samples, (2) m the number of mixture signals, and (3) n\nthe number of source signals. For the Raman data we considered in the paper, there\nare more mixtures than sources, i.e., m \u2265 n. The goal is to recover W and M for\na given R. This is also known as an NMF problem. Various methods have been\ndeveloped to solve BSS problems by exploiting the natures of source signals. For\n3\n\n\fexample, independent component analysis (ICA) recovers statistically independent\nsignals. However, the independence should not be assumed on the Raman spectra of\nthe chemical substances when they share common structural features (the line shapes\nof their Raman spectra are similar). A better working assumption for the data is a\nso-called partial sparseness condition. Namely, the source signals are only required to\nbe non-overlapping at some locations of acquisition variable. This sparseness condition was first known in the 1990s [1, 22] in the study of blind hyper-spectral unmixing\nof remote sensing, where the source condition is called pixel purity assumption (PPA)\n[2]. In 2005, Naanaa and Nuzillard [14] used this assumption to separate the signals\nin nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In fact, this condition is well suited to\nmany chemical substances including those studied in this paper. Such a sparseness\ncondition leads to a dramatic mathematical simplification of a general non-negative\nmatrix factorization problem (2.3) which is non-convex. Geometrically speaking, the\nproblem of finding the mixing matrix M reduces to the identification of a minimal cone\ncontaining the rows of matrix R. The latter can be achieved by linear programming.\nIn the context of hyper-spectral unmixing, the resulting geometric (cone) method is\nthe so called N-findr [22], and is now a benchmark in hyper-spectral unmixing. Next\nwe shall review the essentials of the partial spareness condition and the geometric\ncone method.\nSimply speaking, the key sparseness assumption on the source signals is that each\nsource has a stand alone peak at some location of acquisition variable where the other\nsources are zero. More precisely, the source matrix W \u2265 0 is assumed to satisfy the\nfollowing condition:\nAssumption. For each j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} there exists an ij \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p} such that\nwij ,j > 0 and wij ,k = 0, (k = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1, i + 1, . . . , n).\nEq. (2.3) can be rewritten in terms of rows as\nRi =\n\nn\nX\n\nwi,k M k i = 1, . . . , p ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere Ri denote the ith row of R, and M k the kth row of M. The source assumption\nimplies that Rij = wij ,j M j j = 1, . . . , n or M j = wi1 ,j Rij . Hence Eq. (2.4) is\nj\nrewritten as\nn\nX\nwi,k ik\ni\nR =\nM ,\n(2.5)\nw\nik ,k\nk=1\nwhich says that every row of R is a nonnegative linear combination of the rows of\nM. The identification of M's rows is equivalent to identifying a convex cone of a\nfinite collection of vectors. The cone encloses the data rows in matrix R, and is\nthe smallest of such cones. Such a minimal enclosing convex cone can be found by\nlinear programming methods. Mathematically, the following optimization problems\nare suggested to estimate the mixing matrix\nmin score = k\n\np\nX\n\nRi \u03bbi \u2212 Rl k2 , s.t. \u03bbi \u2265 0 , l = 1, . . . , p .\n\ni=1,i6=l\n\n4\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fA score is associated with each row of R. A row with a low score is unlikely to be a\nrow of M because this row is roughly a nonnegative linear combination of the other\nrows of R. On the other hand, a high score means that the corresponding row is far\nfrom being a nonnegative linear combination of other rows. The n rows from R with\nhighest scores are selected to form M, the mixing matrix.\n\n2.3\n\nSparse source recovery\n\nWith the recovery of M, we solve for W next. An existing method [14] is to directly\ncompute W = R M + , where M + is the pseudo-inverse of M. It is however sensitive\nto noise, and tends to introduce errors and artifacts of negative values. Although\na nonnegative least squares can produce a nonnegative W , spurious peaks might be\nintroduced in the results. To benefit from the sparseness source condition in the first\nstep, a more reliable method is to solve a nonnegative l1 optimization. Although the\nsource signals (columns of W ) are not sparse, the rows of W possess sparsity. Hence,\nwe seek the sparsest solution for each row W i of W .\nmin kW i k0\n\nsubject to W i M = Ri , W i \u2265 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere k*k0 ( 0-norm ) represents the number of nonzeros. Because of the non-convexity\nof the 0-norm, we minimize the l1 -norm as a convex relaxation:\nmin kW i k1\n\nsubject to W i M = Ri , W i \u2265 0,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhich is in the form of linear programming. The fact that the data may in general\ncontain noise suggests us to solve the following unconstrained optimization problem,\n1\nmin \u03bckW i k1 + kRi \u2212 W i Mk22 ,\n2\nW i \u22650\n\n(2.9)\n\nfor which Bregman iterative method [8, 24] with a proper projection onto non-negative\nconvex subset is used to obtain a solution. In this paper, we shall use the linearized\nBregman iteration to solve (2.9) due to its efficiency.

A signature of a mixture of these pure substances is shown on the left.\n\n3\n\nNumerical experiments\n\nIn this section, we shall apply our method to the so-called SWOrRD Raman data\nprovided by the Naval Research Laboratory, and present the computational results.\n\n3.1\n\nSWOrRD Data\n\nThe Swept Wavelength Optical Resonant Raman Detector (SWOrRD) at the Naval\nResearch Laboratory is a spectroscopy system which is able to produce two dimensional spectral data of biological agents and chemical substances. A target substance\nis illuminated with a specific laser wavelength and this generates a resonance Raman\nspectrum. When the laser wavelength is varied and the process is repeated, the resonance Raman spectra (one at each laser wavelength), forms a two-dimensional plot\n(signature) where one axis is the input laser wavelength and the other axis is the\nwavenumber of the Raman spectrum. Fig. 1 is an example of 2D SWorRD Raman\nspectra of a mixture of ethanol, ethylene glycol, acetonitrile, and water. The data\nmatrix X corresponds to this 2D spectra. Each column X is a Raman spectrum of\nthe mixture at a specific laser wavelength. For SWorRD data, there are much more\nmixtures than the number of sources. The spectral features may be slightly altered\nfrom one wavelength to another. To reduce this effect, we do not necessarily use all\nthe data, and so we sample the spectra at a subset of input laser wavelengths.\n\n3.2\n\nResults\n\nWe report here the computational results from our proposed method. We tested\nour method on two sets of SWorRD data. The samples consist of several liquid\nsubstances, some of them are commonly used for synthesizing explosives.

This\nsample is known to contain methanol and its concentration is below 1/3. There are\nalso two a-priori unknown liquid chemicals. The method first fits the known reference\nspectrum of methanol to the Raman data. Then it identifies two unknown chemicals\nfrom the fitting residuals. The results are shown in a series of plots, Fig. 2-Fig.\n5. From all the data available, we found that the 5 spectra at consecutive laser\nwavelengths of (248, 250, 252, 254, 256) nm produce the best results. The theoretical\nunderpinning of optimal selection of the data is under further study. Fig. 2 shows the\nline shape of the spectrum of the mixture, and the spectral reference of methanol. The\nresidual after fitting methanol to the data is plotted in Fig. 3, where some structure\ncan be seen. Then further identification of the two hidden chemicals was made by\nthe convex BSS method, and the results are presented in Fig. 4. Compared to the\nground truth, the results are satisfactory in that the recovered spectral structures are\nrecognizable as ethanol and acetonitrile. Conventional method such as NMF tends\nto lose reliability in dealing with the data, the NMF results are also presented as a\ncomparison. In the second example, we try to identify two hidden chemicals from a\nmixture of four chemicals. The known chemicals are methanol and ethanol. The total\nconcentration of the two is below 1/2, which is known from the sensing hardware. The\ncomputational results are presented in Fig. 6-Fig. 9. Although no apparent Raman\nspectral structure can be identified from the first plot in Fig. 8 , the second structure is\neasily recognizable as acetonitrile upon comparison with reference spectrum. Next we\nsubtract the confirmed acetonitrile from the residual by solving the constrained least\nsquares in step 1, then feed the new residual back to step 2 for extracting more hidden\nchemicals. The extracted structure in Fig. 9 can be easily identified as ethylene glycol\ncomparing to the ground truth. Computations are performed on a Dell laptop with\n6G RAM and 1.6 GHz i7 CPU. The cpu time for example 1 is 7.613 seconds, and it\nis 10.327 seconds for example 2. The method proves to be efficient and can be of use\nin rapid detection of chemical substances.\n\n7\n\n\f8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\nWavenumber (cm\u22121)\n\nFigure 3: One fitting residual from the constrained least squares data fitting.\n\n2\n\n10\n\nEthanol\n\n8\n\n1.5\n\n6\n1\n\n4\n2\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n\u22122\n500\n\n4500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nWavenumber (cm\u22121)\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\nWavenumber (cm\u22121)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\nAcetonitrile\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n\u22122\n500\n\n4500\n\nWavenumber (cm\u22121)\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nWavenumber (cm\u22121)\n\nFigure 4: Left column is the two identified spectral structures, right column shows\nthe Raman spectral references for ethanol and acetonitrile.

The\nmethod is designed to identify potentially hidden chemicals after fitting the known\nspectral references to the data. Our method can be useful for extracting unknown\nsource signals from the residuals after known reference spectra have been first deployed\nto fit the data. The major strength of the technique is its ability to be used either\nwith known reference spectra for quantification or without reference spectra for identification of unknown/hidden chemical substances. Numerical results on SWOrRD\ndata showed the promising potential of our method on explosives detection.\nThe model considered in the paper is a linear and stationary model which assumes\nno shift/squeeze in the spectral lines. A future line of work will study how to build this\nnonlinear effect into the identification model. Given that the shift/squeeze amount is\nsmall, one may explore the idea of image registration. We also plan to study more\nreliable and efficient methods for the residuals decomposition, as their success highly\ndepends on a viable working assumption on the pure signals.\nThe semi-blind source identification problem we addressed here also has analogues\nin detecting atmospheric trace gases with the so called differential optical absorption\nspectroscopy. Analysis of the fitting residuals for mysterious species arises there as\nwell, and is non-convex in general. Recently the authors achieved some success in this\ndirection based on a similar semi-blind framework, although the details of fitting and\nblind source identification process are quite different [20].\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.
