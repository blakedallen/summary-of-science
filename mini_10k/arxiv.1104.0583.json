Here we establish a basic and general framework for quantum system identification, that\nallows us to classify how much knowledge about the quantum system is attainable, in principle, from\na given experimental setup. Prior knowledge on some elements of the black box helps the system\nidentification. We present an example in which a Bell measurement is more efficient to identify the\nsystem. When the topology of the system is known, the framework enables us to establish a general\ncriterion for the estimability of the coupling constants in its Hamiltonian.\n\nSome of the most exciting and puzzling concepts in\nquantum theory can already be observed in simple systems. These are, for example, superpositions and decoherence, tunneling, entanglement and non-locality, quantum cryptography, teleportation and dense coding. Many\nof such theoretical ideas have been confirmed experimentally with a tremendous accuracy. On the other hand,\nperhaps the most important theoretical concept-a full\nquantum computer or simulator-is still well out of reach,\nbecause it requires a fully controllable system of Hilbert\nspace dimension at the very least of the order of 2100 . Its\nrealization poses one of the greatest challenges in science\ntoday.\nOn our path towards quantum computation we are\nbuilding systems composed of more and more qubits,\nthe quantum information theoretic equivalent of the bit.\nBut while an information theoretic approach is very successful, we should not forget that any implementation\ncomes with a baggage of physical effects. In particular, real qubits interact. Often, these interactions are\nimportant: they are actively used to create logical gates.\nSometimes, they are unwanted, and either suppressed actively, or simply neglected. However if we are to meet the\nstringent bounds that fault-tolerance computation puts\non the required precision of our technology, we will have\nto estimate our quantum system with very high precision. Current estimates of the fault-tolerance threshold\nindicate that in many systems the relative precision will\nhave to be of the order of 10\u22123 \u201310\u22124 .\nIf we could perfectly control our system, achieving such\nprecisions is a mere engineering difficulty. But if our control relies on the system couplings, or is heavily perturbed\nby them, we are in a Catch-22 situation, and it is unclear\nhow well the system can be estimated even in principle.\nIn this paper, we solve this question by providing a precise mathematical description of the equivalent set [1\u20133]\nof closed systems. This set describes the possible implementations of a system that cannot be distinguished\nwith a given experimental setup. It should be compared\nto the well-known reachable set in quantum control [4],\nwhich describes the set of unitary operations that can be\nimplemented, in principle, by a given experimental setup.\n\nIt has been shown in quantum control that even when\nonly parts of the system are accessed, the reachable set\ntypically remains maximal: the system is capable of\nquantum computation [5]. We show that this is not true\nfor full estimability: in general, infinitely many different\nsystem Hamiltonians give rise to the same input-output\nbehavior. However, we show how a priori knowledge\nabout the system helps to restrict the set of possible systems. Indeed we prove that in a generic limited-access\nsituation, relatively little a priori knowledge can imply\nfull estimability. This generalizes several recently developed schemes for indirect estimation [6\u20139]. We also show\nhow estimability can strongly depend on the structure of\nquantum measurements, by providing an example where\nentangled observables are more efficient for the estimation than product observables.\nOur analysis first follows closely the known results from\nbilinear theory [1]. Then, we use a result from Lie algebras [10] to translate the bilinear theory to the quantum\ncase. This sets our result apart from previous work which\nrequired additional mathematical assumptions [2, 3].\nSetup.- We consider a black box with Ni inputs\nand No outputs. Inside the black box, some quantummechanical unitary dynamics takes place. Our goal is to\nfind a model for the black box that perfectly describes its\ninput-output behavior under all possible circumstances\n(system identification [1]).\n\nf1 (t)\nf2 (t)\nfNi (t)\n\nM1\nH1\nH2 H 0 M 2\n\u03c10\nMNo\nHN i\n\ntr{M1 \u03c1(t)}\ntr{M2 \u03c1(t)}\ntr{MNo \u03c1(t)}\n\nFigure 1: A set of time dependent functions fk (t) is the\ninput, which determines the unitary dynamics inside the\nblack box, and a set of the expectation values of observables\nMl is the output. Our objective is to estimate the system\n\u03c3 = {H0 , Hk , Ml , \u03c10 } by looking at the input-output behavior of the black box. In the most extreme case, even the\ncontrol operations Hk and the observables Ml are unknown.\n\n\f2\nMore specifically, we are modeling a system with a\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space H, a time dependent\nHamiltonian\nH(t) = H0 +\n\nNi\nX\n\nfk (t)Hk ,\n\nk=1\n\nan initial quantum state \u03c10 , and a set of observables Ml\n(l = 1, . . . , No ). Without loss of generality we chose H0\nand Hk traceless. The inputs are the functions fk (t) (k =\n1, . . . , Ni ), which are assumed to be piecewise constant.\nThe outputs are the expectation values of the observables\nMl ,\n\u0012\u02c6 t\n\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\ntr{Ml \u03c1(t)} with \u03c1(t) = T\u2192 exp\ndt L(t ) \u03c10 ,\n0\n\nwhere\nL(t) = L0 +\n\nNi\nX\n\nk=1\n\nfk (t)Lk , Lk = \u2212i[Hk , \u2022 ] (k = 0, . . . , Ni )\n\nare the Liouvillians corresponding to the Hamiltonians.\nSee Fig. 1. Because we are interested in whether systems\ncan be distinguished in principle, we assume that it is\npossible to collect statistics at arbitrary precision, and\nthat infinitely many copies of the system are available\n(this allows us to ignore any back-action of the measurements [2, 3]). Our main assumption is that the system\nis controllable, implying that any unitary transformation\ncan be realized by the Hamiltonian dynamics with H(t),\nby properly arranging the inputs fk (t). Mathematically\nthis amounts to the smallest Lie algebra over the reals that contains the matrices iH0 , iH1 , . . . , iHNi being\nequal to the full Lie algebra su(dim H) of traceless skewhermitian matrices of size dim H\u00d7dim H. Controllability\nis a generic property of systems, and is in principle an\nobservable property, if the dimension of the underlying\nHilbert space is known. Furthermore we exclude the trivial cases where Ml or \u03c10 is proportional to the identity\noperator.\nWe put all parameters together in the system \u03c3 =\n{H0 , Hk , Ml , \u03c10 }. Two systems \u03c3 and \u03c3\u0302 are called equivalent [1], if they are indistinguishable by all input-output\nexperiments. Therefore by definition, we can estimate\nthe real system \u03c3 up to equivalence. Let us call the estimated system \u03c3\u0302, which consists of estimated components \u03c3\u0302 = {\u01240 , \u0124k , M\u0302l , \u03c1\u03020 }. We assume that the estimated system has been chosen to be of minimal dimension, which implies that this system is also controllable.\nThe goal is now to find a mathematical description of\nhow different \u03c3\u0302 can be from the real system \u03c3.\nEquivalence and similarity:- We first have to find a\nmathematical description of the equivalence. For some\nfixed input, equivalence means that the real system and\nthe estimated system have to agree on all observable outputs for all times, i.e.,\ntr{Ml \u03c1(t)} = tr{M\u0302l \u03c1\u0302(t)},\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302(t) is the state evolving from the initial state \u03c1\u03020\nwith the Hamiltonians \u01240 and \u0124k . This is not very\nuseful mathematically, because it still involves solving\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation. There is an algebraic description of this property that is much easier. Let us denote\nL\u03b1 \u2261 L\u03b1L * * * L\u03b11 , where \u03b1 is a multi-index of length L\nwith entries \u03b1j \u2208 0, . . . , Ni . Further, we include the case\nL = 0 as the identity superoperator and introduce similar notation L\u0302\u03b1 for the estimated system. Equivalence\ncan then be formulated as\ntr{Ml L\u03b1 \u03c10 } = tr{M\u0302l L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 }\n\n(2)\n\nfor any sequence of the indices \u03b1. This can be thought\nof as an \"infinitesimal version\" of (1), and a simple proof\nof this statement is found in [2].\nWe call systems similar if and only if there is a similarity transformation between them\nLk = T L\u0302k T \u22121 ,\n\nMl = M\u0302l T \u22121 ,\n\n\u03c10 = T \u03c1\u03020 ,\n\n(3)\n\n(k = 0, . . . , Ni ) where Ml and M\u0302l represent the actions\nof Ml and M\u0302l in the Liouville space. It is obvious that\nsimilarity implies equivalence. Similarity is much easier\nto handle than equivalence, because of its simple mathematical structure.\nTranslation to quantum case:- In bilinear system\ntheory [1] it was shown that if \u03c3 is controllable, then\nequivalence implies similarity. This is proven by explicit\nconstruction of the similarity transformation between \u03c3\nand \u03c3\u0302. Because there are some subtle differences in the\nquantum case, we briefly repeat these arguments.\nAssume \u03c3 and \u03c3\u0302 are equivalent and pick an arbitrary\nstate \u03c1\u0302. We show that due to the controllability of system\n\u03c3\u0302, the state \u03c1\u0302 can be expressed as\nX\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n(4)\n\u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 .\n\u03b1\n\nFirstly, because i\u03c1\u03020 \u2208 u(dim H) (the algebra\nP of skewhermitian matrices) the set R \u2261 {iA | A = \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 }\nis a subset of u(dim H).\nBecause i[L\u0302k , L\u0302j ] =\n\u2212i[[\u0124k , \u0124j ], \u2022 ] and we have controllability, the linear\ncombinations of L\u0302\u03b1 include L\u0124 \u2261 \u2212i[\u0124, \u2022 ] for any hermitian \u0124. This means that [i\u0124, iA] \u2208 R, so R is an ideal.\nBecause it is not equal to the identity and not su(dim H),\nwe must have R = u(dim H).\nP Therefore, we can express\nany hermitian operator as \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 , and in particular\nany state \u03c1\u0302, as in (4).\nWe then define T by\nX\nT \u03c1\u0302 =\n\u03bb\u03b1 L\u03b1 \u03c10 .\n\u03b1\n\nThere are many possible representations of \u03c1\u0302. In order\nto see that T is well-defined as a mapping,\nP we need to\nverify that any two equal representations \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 =\n\n\f3\nP\nP\n\u03bb\u2032\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 imply \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 L\u03b1 \u03c10 = \u03b1 \u03bb\u2032\u03b1 L\u03b1 \u03c10 . By linearity, it is enough to show that\nX\nX\n\u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 = 0 =\u21d2\n\u03bb\u03b1 L\u03b1 \u03c10 = 0.\n(5)\n\nP\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nP\n\nSuppose that \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 = 0. Then, we have for any \u03b2\n\u001b X\n\u001a\nX\ntr M\u0302l L\u0302\u03b2\n\u03bb\u03b1 tr{M\u0302l L\u0302\u03b2\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 } = 0,\n\u03bb\u03b1 L\u0302\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 =\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere L\u0302\u03b2\u03b1 = L\u0302\u03b2 L\u0302\u03b1 . Now, due to the input-output\nequivalence (2) between the two systems \u03c3 and \u03c3\u0302, i.e.,\ntr{M\u0302l L\u0302\u03b2\u03b1 \u03c1\u03020 } = tr{Ml L\u03b2\u03b1 \u03c10 } for any \u03b2\u03b1, we get\n\u001b X\n\u001a\nX\ntr Ml L\u03b2\n\u03bb\u03b1 tr{Ml L\u03b2\u03b1 \u03c10 } = 0.\n\u03bb\u03b1 L\u03b1 \u03c10 =\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nSince this holds\nP for any \u03b2 and the system is controllable,\nwe conclude \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 L\u03b1 \u03c10 = 0, which completes the proof\nof (5). The mapping is onto due to the controllability of\nthe system, and is shown to be one-to-one by reversing\nthe argument which proved that it is well defined. Finally\nusing controllability and the property T \u03c1\u03020 = \u03c10 it is easy\nto see that T has to fulfill (3).\nUnitarity:- Since we restrict ourselves to unitary\ndynamics, it is possible to prove that the above similarity\nS( \u2022 ) \u2261 T \u2022 T \u22121 is actually inducing a unitary transformation on Hamiltonians. First, we note that both the\nreal and the estimated Liouvillians have the commutator structure Lk = \u2212i[Hk , \u2022 ] and L\u0302k = \u2212i[\u0124k , \u2022 ], because we restrict ourselves to unitary dynamics. These\nLiouvillians form a subspace U of all possible Liouvillians. We first show that controllability implies that this\nsubspace is mapped into itself by the similarity transformation S. Indeed, a simple expansion of commutators\ncombined with S being a similarity transformation shows\nthat\nS(\u2212i[[\u0124k , \u0124j ], \u2022 ]) = S(i[L\u0302k , L\u0302j ]) = i[Lk , Lj ]\n\n= \u2212i[[Hk , Hj ], \u2022 ] \u2208 U.\n\n(6)\n\nBy linearity, any element \u0124 of the generated algebra has\nthe property that S(\u2212i[\u0124, \u2022 ]) \u2208 U. Because the system\nis controllable, this algebra is just the set of all traceless hermitian matrices, and therefore S(U) = U. Since\nthere is an isomorphism between L\u0124 = \u2212i[\u0124, \u2022 ] and \u0124,\nwe can represent the action of S on U by a corresponding action on su(dim H). By linearity, this must be a\nlinear and invertible map S. Indeed, from (6) it follows\nthat S([\u0124, \u0124 \u2032 ]) = [S(\u0124), S(\u0124 \u2032 )]: S is a Lie automorphism. A theorem in [10] states that all automorphisms\non gl(n) (the general matrix algebra) are of the form\nS(X) = AXA\u22121 or S(X) = \u2212AX T A\u22121 . Our automorphism is instead on the sub-algebra su(dim H). By choosing a hermitian basis of gl(n) we can extend it uniquely to\n\none of gl(n) and apply the theorem. The additional hermitian structure demands furthermore that A\u22121 = A\u2020 .\nThus S(\u0124) = U \u0124U \u2020 or S(\u0124) = \u2212U \u0124 T U \u2020 . The latter is\nexcluded because it would not preserve the trace of quantum states. Hence, under the premise of controllability,\ntwo systems are indistinguishable if and only if they are\nrelated through a unitary transformation\nHk = U \u0124k U \u2020 ,\n\nMl = U M\u0302l U \u2020 ,\n\n\u03c10 = U \u03c1\u03020 U \u2020 .\n\nUsage of a priori knowledge:- In practice, it is reasonable to assume that some elements of the black box\nare known. Each known element shrinks the set of\npossible unitary transformations, because, for example,\nHk = U \u0124k U \u2020 = \u0124k implies [U, \u0124k ] = 0.\nAs an example, we consider two qubits coupled by an\nunknown Hamiltonian. We estimate them by performing\narbitrary operations \u01241 = X1 \u2297 112 and \u01242 = Y1 \u2297 112 on\nthe first qubit and by measuring a) Z1 \u2297 112 , b) Z1 \u2297Z2 , or\nc) |\u03a8\u2212 i12 h\u03a8\u2212 |, where Xi , Yi , and Zi are the Pauli opera\u221a\ntors of qubit i = 1, 2, and |\u03a8\u2212 i12 = (|01i12 \u2212 |10i12 )/ 2\nis the singlet state. Assuming that the system is controllable, we can apply the above results.\nFirst, the conditions [U, \u0124k ] = 0 reduce the unitary\ntransformation U to 111 \u2297 U2 , where U2 is a unitary operator acting on the second qubit, which may be parami\neterized as U2 = e\u2212 2 \u03b8n*\u03c32 with a unit vector n. We then\nimpose another condition [U, M\u0302 ] = 0:\na) In the first case with M\u0302 = Z1 \u2297 112 , this condition is\nalready satisfied and the unitary transformation U is not\ni\nreduced any further, U = 111 \u2297 e\u2212 2 \u03b8n*\u03c32 , where remain\nthree parameters.\nb) In the second case with M\u0302 = Z1 \u2297 Z2 , the condition\ni\nreduces U to 111 \u2297 e\u2212 2 \u03b8Z2 with a single parameter.\nc) Finally, in the third case with M\u0302 = |\u03a8\u2212 ih\u03a8\u2212 |, we\nhave\n\u03b8\u0010\nnz |\u03a8+ ih\u03a8\u2212 | \u2212 nx |\u03a6\u2212 ih\u03a8\u2212 |\n[U, M\u0302 ] = i sin\n2\n\u0011\n+ iny |\u03a6+ ih\u03a8\u2212 | + h.c.,\nwhich is vanishing only when sin(\u03b8/2) = 0, i.e., U =\n11 up to an irrelevant phase. This shows that the Bell\n\nmeasurement is more efficient to estimate the system.\nInfection criterion for arbitrary systems:- Let us\nconsider another more general example, a generic Hamiltonian of a d-dimensional Hilbert space in the form\nX\ncnm |nihm|,\n(7)\nH0 =\n(n,m)\u2208E\n\nwhere the orthonormal basis |ni may be thought of as\n\"local,\" and E are the edges of the graph G = (|ni, E),\nthat describes the non-zero off-diagonal (n 6= m) couplings cnm . We assume that a set of nodes C can be\ncontrolled (Hk = |kihk|, k \u2208 C), and that (at least)\none particular node of C can be measured (M1 = |1ih1|,\n\n\f4\n1 \u2208 C). The crucial assumption about the set C is that\nit is \"infecting\" G [7]. This property is defined by the following propagation rules: 1) C is \"infected\"; 2) infected\nnodes remain infected; and 3) the infection propagates\nfrom an infected node to a \"healthy\" neighbor iff it is its\nonly healthy neighbor. For an arbitrary Hamiltonian we\ncan always find an infecting set; how many nodes it contains depends on how sparse the Hamiltonian is in the\nparticular basis of consideration. In practice there are\nphysical choices of the basis corresponding to local operations, and many Hamiltonians are infected by acting on\na vanishing fraction of nodes only.\nBased on the assumption that C is infecting one finds\nthat the system is controllable, so our theorem can be\napplied. Firstly, there is a k \u2208 C that has a unique\nneighbor\nl outside C. For that k we have [iHk , iH0 ] =\nP\n\u2212 m\u2208n(k) (ckm |kihm| \u2212 cmk |mihk|), where n(k) is the\nneighborhood of k. Commuting it with iHk again yields\nX\n(ckm |kihm| + cmk |mihk|).\n[[iHk , iH0 ], iHk ] = i\nm\u2208n(k)\n\n(8)\nFor m \u2208 n(k) \u2229 C, on the other hand, we can single out\nterms by\n[[iHm , iH0 ], iHk ] = \u2212i(ckm |kihm| + cmk |mihk|).\nBy adding these to (8) for all m \u2208 n(k) \u2229 C, only a single\nterm i(ckl |kihl| + clk |lihk|) is left. Commuting this with\niHk again gives ckl |kihl| \u2212 clk |lihk|. Finally, commuting\nthe latter two and subtracting the term proportional to\niHk we are left with i|lihl|. By induction, we can obtain\n|nihn|, \u2200n. This implies full controllability [11].\nIf we assume that Hk and M1 are known, we need to\nlook at the unitaries that commute with these operators.\nThere will be many. However, we will assume here the\nknowledge that the Hamiltonian H0 has the form given\nin (7). Hence, we are talking about an indirect coupling\nstrength estimation [6\u20139], where the topology E is known\nwhile the parameters are unknown. Let us see what this\nknowledge implies. Firstly, we have to have [Hk , U ] =\n0 = \u2212[Hk , U \u2020 ] (k \u2208 C). Since Hk are projectors that\nimplies that |ki must be an eigenstate of U and U \u2020 for\nall k \u2208 C. The estimated P\nHamiltonian \u01240 = U H0 U \u2020\nhas to be of the form \u01240 = (n,m)\u2208E \u0109nm |nihm|, where\n\u0109nm are unequal to zero and could in principle differ from\ncnm . The edges E must be the same for both H0 and \u01240\nbecause we assume knowledge of the topology. Because\nC is an infecting set, there is one k \u2208 C that has a\nunique neighbor l outside of C. The corresponding term\nin the Hamiltonian H0 is ckl |kihl| + clk |lihk|. Because\n|ki is an eigenstate of U this transforms under U \u2022 U \u2020\ninto ckl ei\u03c6k |kihl|U \u2020 + clk e\u2212i\u03c6k U |lihk|. Because the edges\nE are the same for H0 and \u01240 there is a corresponding\nterm \u0109kl |kihl| + \u0109lk |lihk| in \u01240 . Furthermore, since |ki\n\nis an eigenstate of U \u2020 no other node |ni can be brought\nto |ki, i.e., hk|U |ni = 0. Given that l is the only node\noutside C coupled to k we conclude\nckl ei\u03c6k |kihl|U \u2020 + clk e\u2212i\u03c6k U |lihk| = \u0109kl |kihl| + \u0109lk |lihk|,\nwhich implies that |li is an eigenstate of U . Finally, by\ninduction we get that U must be a diagonal matrix in the\n\"local\" basis |ni. Thus, up to the local phases of the basis\nvectors the Hamiltonian H0 is uniquely estimated. What\nis remarkable here is that we do not have to assume the\nknowledge of the phases of cnm and it suffices to measure\na single node. This generalizes the previous results [6\u20139]\nsubstantially.\nConclusion:- We have shown that controlable closed\nquantum systems can be estimated, in principle, up to\nunitary conjugation. This provides an easy-to-check criterion for experimental setups, telling us which extra controls, measurements or a priori knowledge are needed to\nachieve highly accurate quantum system identification required for quantum computation. We have applied this\ncriterion to a simple setup to show how the structure of\nthe measurement observables can be important for estimation efficieny, and we have constructed a method to\nobtain a fully controllable and estimable system from an\narbitray Hamiltonian.\nWe acknowledge fruitful discussions with Madalin\nGuta, Koenraad Audenaert, Vittorio Giovannetti, Koji\nMaruyama, and Martin B.
