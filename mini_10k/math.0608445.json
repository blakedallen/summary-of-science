KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\nIn memory of Marvin Rosenblum\nAbstract. Let \u03b6 and \u03b7 be distinct points on the unit circle and suppose that\n\u03c6 is a linear-fractional self-map of the unit disk D, not an automorphism, with\n\u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7. We describe the C \u2217 -algebra generated by the associated composition\noperator C\u03c6 and the shift operator, acting on the Hardy space on D.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nAny analytic self-map \u03c6 of the unit disk D induces a bounded composition operator C\u03c6 : f \u2192 f \u25e6 \u03c6 on the Hardy space H 2 . The linear-fractional self-maps\nof D form a rich class of examples, and many properties of composition operators\nare profitably studied in the context of these maps (e.g. cyclicity, spectral properties, subnormality; see [7], [9], [22]). The space H 2 also supports the Toeplitz\noperators Tw . Here, w is a bounded measurable function on the unit circle \u2202D, and\nTw acts on H 2 by Tw f = P (wf ), where P is the orthogonal projection of L2 (the\nLebesgue space associated with normalized arc-length measure on \u2202D) onto H 2 .\nTaking w to be the independent variable z, one obtains the shift operator Tz on\nH 2 . A theorem of I. Gohberg and I. Fel'dman ([12], [13]) and L. Coburn ([4], [5])\nasserts that C \u2217 (Tz ), the unital C \u2217 - algebra generated by Tz , contains the ideal K\nof compact operators, as well as all Toeplitz operators Tw with continuous symbol\nw. Moreover, the map sending w to the coset of Tw is a \u2217-isomorphism of C(\u2202D),\nthe algebra of continuous functions on \u2202D, onto the quotient algebra C \u2217 (Tz )/K.\nIn this article our goal is to replace C \u2217 (Tz ) by C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ), the unital C \u2217 -algebra\ngenerated by Tz and C\u03c6 , for certain linear-fractional \u03c6.\nSection 2 presents a characterization of those analytic self-maps \u03c6 of D with\n|\u03c6(ei\u03b8 )| < 1 a.e. on \u2202D for which C\u03c6 commutes with Tz or Tz\u2217 modulo K. In\nSection 3 we show that for any linear-fractional self-map \u03c6 of the disk which is not an\nautomorphism, there is an associated linear-fractional map \u03c3 (the \"Krein adjoint\"\nof \u03c6) and a scalar s so that C\u03c6\u2217 = sC\u03c3 +K for some compact operator K. Our setting\nhere is primarily that of H 2 , although this result is easily extended to the Bergman\nspace. This theorem plays a key role in the work in Section 4, where we study\nC \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ). Recent work of M. Jury [17] treats the case where \u03c6 is an automorphism\n(and indeed ranges over a discrete group \u0393 of automorphisms), showing that the\nC \u2217 -algebra generated by {C\u03c6 : \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393} contains Tz , and exhibiting the quotient of\nthis algebra by K as the discrete crossed product C(\u2202D) \u00d7 \u0393. In the present article\nwe suppose \u03c6 is not an automorphism but does satisfy k\u03c6k\u221e = 1. In the case that \u03c6\nis a parabolic non-automorphism (see Section 2 for a discussion of this terminology;\nDate: July 14, 2005.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 47B33.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTHOMAS L. KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\nsuch maps have a fixed point on \u2202D), the work of P. Bourdon, D. Levi, S. Narayan\nand J. Shapiro in [3] shows that C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 \u2212C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 is compact. Such a C\u03c6 also commutes\nwith Tz and Tz\u2217 modulo K, so that C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 )/K is commutative, hence describable\nby Gelfand theory. Here we suppose that \u03c6 is neither an automorphism nor a\nparabolic non-automorphism, but that there exist distinct points \u03b6, \u03b7 in \u2202D with\n\u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7. In this case C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 )/K is not commutative, but we will see that it is\ntractable. As an application, in Section 4.6 we concretely determine the essential\nspectrum of any element of C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ). Our main tool is the localization theorem\nof R. G. Douglas [11].\nWe thank Paul Bourdon for several helpful comments.\n2. COMPOSITION OPERATORS ESSENTIALLY COMMUTING WITH\nTz OR Tz\u2217\nThe commutator AB \u2212 BA of two bounded operators A and B on a Hilbert\nspace H is denoted [A, B]. An operator is said to be essentially normal if its selfcommutator [A\u2217 , A] is compact. In the course of their work on essentially normal\nlinear-fractional composition operators, Bourdon, Levi, Narayan and Shapiro [3]\nshow that if \u03c6 is a linear fractional non-automorphism mapping D into D and\nfixing a point of \u2202D, then [Tz\u2217 , C\u03c6 ] is compact, where Tz is the shift on H 2 . Here\nwe will give a generalization which is perhaps of independent interest.\nFor \u03b1 a complex number of modulus 1, and \u03c6 an analytic self-map of D, the\nreal part of (\u03b1 + \u03c6)/(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6) is a positive harmonic function on D. Necessarily then\nthis function is the Poisson integral of a finite positive Borel measure \u03bc\u03b1 on \u2202D;\n\u03bc\u03b1 , |\u03b1| = 1 are the Clark measures for \u03c6. We write E(\u03c6) for the closure in \u2202D of\nthe union of the closed supports of the singular parts \u03bcs\u03b1 of the Clark measures as\n\u03b1 ranges over the unit circle. For a linear-fractional non-automorphism \u03c6 which\nsends \u03b6 \u2208 \u2202D to \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D, one has \u03bcs\u03b1 = 0 when \u03b1 6= \u03b7 and \u03bcs\u03b7 = |\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)|\u22121 \u03b4\u03b6 , where\n\u03b4\u03b6 is the unit point mass at \u03b6. We will use the following result, proved in [18].\nHere Mw denotes the operator on L2 = L2 (\u2202D) of multiplication by the bounded\nmeasurable function w.\nTheorem 1. [18] Let \u03c6 be an analytic self-map of D such that |\u03c6(ei\u03b8 )| < 1 a.e.\nwith respect to Lebesgue measure on \u2202D, and suppose that w is a bounded measurable function on \u2202D which is continuous at each point of E(\u03c6). The weighted\ncomposition operator Mw C\u03c6 : H 2 \u2192 L2 is compact if and only if w \u2261 0 on E(\u03c6).\nIt will be convenient to recast Theorem 1 in terms of Toeplitz operators.\n\nCorollary 1. Suppose that \u03c6 and w satisfy the hypotheses in the first sentence of\nTheorem 1. Then Tw C\u03c6 : H 2 \u2192 H 2 is compact if and only if w \u2261 0 on E(\u03c6).\n\nProof. It is enough to show that Mw C\u03c6 is compact when Tw C\u03c6 is compact. Note\nthat\nMw C\u03c6 = Tw C\u03c6 + Hw C\u03c6\n2\n2 \u22a5\nwhere Hw : H \u2192 (H ) is the Hankel operator defined by Hw = (I \u2212 P )Mw |H 2 .\nWe need only check that Hw C\u03c6 is compact. Let w\u0303 be a continuous function on \u2202D\nagreeing with w on E(\u03c6). We have\nHw C\u03c6 = (I \u2212 P )M(w\u2212w\u0303) C\u03c6 + Hw\u0303 C\u03c6 .\n\nSince w\u0303 is continuous, Hw\u0303 is compact by Hartman's theorem [14]. On the other\nhand, M(w\u2212w\u0303) C\u03c6 is compact by Theorem 1, and we are done.\n\u0003\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nThe next result gives the above-mentioned generalization.\nTheorem 2. Let \u03c6 be an analytic self-map of D such that |\u03c6(ei\u03b8 )| < 1 a.e. with\nrespect to Lebesgue measure. Suppose that \u03c6 agrees almost everywhere on \u2202D with\na bounded measurable function \u03c6\nb which is continuous at each point of E(\u03c6). Then\nthe following are equivalent:\n(i) [Tz , C\u03c6 ] \u2208 K.\n(ii) [Tz\u2217 , C\u03c6 ] \u2208 K.\n(iii) For each \u03b6 in E(\u03c6), \u03c6(\u03b6)\nb\n= \u03b6.\n\nWhen these conditions hold, [Tw , C\u03c6 ] \u2208 K for every w in C(\u2202D).\nProof. We use the following identity from [3]:\n(1)\n\n[Tz\u2217 , C\u03c6 ] = T(z\u03c6\u22121) C\u03c6 Tz\u2217 .\n\nSince Tz\u2217 , the backward shift, is a partial isometry with range H 2 , the operator on\nthe right-hand side of Equation (1) is compact exactly when T(z\u03c6\u22121) C\u03c6 is compact.\nC\u03c6 . Corollary 1 gives the equivalence\nThis operator clearly coincides with T(z\u03c6\u22121)\nb\nof (ii) and (iii). For the equivalence of (i) and (iii) we easily check that\n[Tz , C\u03c6 ] = T(z\u2212\u03c6) C\u03c6 = T(z\u2212\u03c6)\nb C\u03c6\n\nand again apply Corollary 1, with w = z \u2212 \u03c6.\nb The statement about [Tw , C\u03c6 ] is\nimmediate.\n\u0003\n3. THE ADJOINT OF C\u03c6\nIn this section we develop some properties of linear-fractional composition operators and their adjoints. To any linear-fractional map\n(2)\n\n\u03c6(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d)\n\nwe associate another linear-fractional map \u03c3\u03c6 defined as\n(3)\n\n\u03c3\u03c6 (z) = (az \u2212 c)/(\u2212bz + d).\n\nThe map \u03c3\u03c6 is sometimes referred to as the \"Krein adjoint\" of \u03c6; for an explanation\nof this terminology, see [10]. When no confusion can result, we write \u03c3 for \u03c3\u03c6 .\nWhen \u03c6 is a self-map of the disk, \u03c3 will be also, and if \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7 for \u03b6, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D, then\n\u03c3(\u03b7) = \u03b6; see [7]. Carl Cowen [7] has shown that the adjoint of any linear-fractional\nC\u03c6 , acting on H 2 , is given by\n(4)\n\nC\u03c6\u2217 = Tg C\u03c3 Th\u2217\n\nwhere g(z) = (\u2212bz + d)\u22121 , h(z) = cz + d, and Tg , Th are the analytic Toeplitz\noperators of multiplication by the H \u221e functions g and h.\nOur first result uses Equation (4) to show that when k\u03c6k\u221e = 1 but \u03c6 is not an\nautomorphism, the adjoint of C\u03c6 , modulo the ideal K of compact operators, is a\nscalar multiple of C\u03c3 .\nTheorem 3. Suppose that \u03c6 given by Equation (2) is a linear-fractional self-map\nof D, not an automorphism, which satisfies \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7 for some \u03b6, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D. Let\ns = (c\u03b6 + d)/(\u2212b\u03b7 + d). Then there exists a compact operator K on H 2 so that\nC\u03c6\u2217 = sC\u03c3 + K, where \u03c3 is as given by Equation (3).\n\n\f4\n\nTHOMAS L. KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\nProof. We first consider the case where \u03b6 = \u03b7, so that \u03b6 is a fixed point of \u03c6. Let\n\u03c3, h and g be associated to \u03c6 as in Equations (3) and (4), and note that \u03c3 fixes \u03b6\nalso. It is immediate that [C\u03c3 , Th\u2217 ] = c[C\u03c3 , Tz\u2217 ]. Invoking Theorem 2, it follows that\nC\u03c3 Th\u2217 = Th\u2217 C\u03c3 + K1 for some compact operator K1 . From Equation (4) we then\nhave\nC\u03c6\u2217\n\n= Tg C\u03c3 Th\u2217\n\u2261 Tg Th\u2217 C\u03c3 (mod K)\n\n\u2261 Thg C\u03c3 (mod K)\n\nwhere the last line is justified by Proposition 7.22 in [11]. Since E(\u03c3) = {\u03b7} = {\u03b6},\nwe may now apply Corollary 1 with w = hg \u2212 h(\u03b6)g(\u03b6) to see that\nThg C\u03c3 \u2212 h(\u03b6)g(\u03b6)C\u03c3 = T(hg\u2212h(\u03b6)g(\u03b6)) C\u03c3 \u2208 K,\nwhich gives the desired conclusion.\nIn the case that \u03b6 6= \u03b7 we consider the map \u03c8(z) = \u03b6\u03b7\u03c6(z) which fixes \u03b6.\nSince C\u03c6\u2217 = CU C\u03c8\u2217 where U (z) = \u03b6\u03b7z, the first part of the argument shows that\nC\u03c6\u2217 = CU C\u03c8\u2217 \u2261 CU (h\u03c8 (\u03b6)g\u03c8 (\u03b6)C\u03c3\u03c8 ) (mod K). Since \u03c3\u03c8 \u25e6 U = \u03c3\u03c6 and h\u03c8 (\u03b6)g\u03c8 (\u03b6) =\n\u0003\n(c\u03b6 + d)/(\u2212b\u03b7 + d), the conclusion follows.\nRemark 1. An analogue of Theorem 3 holds in the Bergman space A2 of analytic\nfunctions in L2 (D, dA), where dA is normalized area measure on D. If \u03c6 given by\nEquation (2) is a self-map of D, then on A2 we have C\u03c6\u2217 = Tg C\u03c3 Th\u2217 , where \u03c3 is\nas in Equation (3), g(z) = (\u2212bz + d)\u22122 , and h(z) = (cz + d)2 [15]. We follow the\noutline of the proof of Theorem 3 to see that C\u03c6\u2217 = sC\u03c3 + K for some compact\nK on A2 , where now s = [(c\u03b6 + d)/(\u2212b\u03b7 + d)]2 . Now the compactness of [C\u03c3 , Tz\u2217 ]\nfollows from Theorem 3 in [19], and the compactness of Thg\u2212h(\u03b6)g(\u03b6) C\u03c3 is obtained\nas an application of Lemma 1 in [20] on compact Carleson measures of the form\nW (z)d(A\u03c3 \u22121 ), with the choice W (z) = |h(z)g(z) \u2212 h(\u03b6)g(\u03b6)|2 . We leave the details\nto the interested reader.\nThe scalar s = (c\u03b6 + d)/(\u2212b\u03b7 + d) can equivalently be described as |\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7)| or\n|\u03c6 (\u03b6)|\u22121 . This will be verified below, in Proposition 3. In particular, the scalar s\nin the statement of Theorem 3 is strictly positive.\n\u2032\n\nCorollary 2. For \u03c6 a linear-fractional self-map of the disk, not an automorphism,\nwith k\u03c6k\u221e = 1, the self-commutator [C\u03c6\u2217 , C\u03c6 ] is compact if and only if \u03c6\u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6.\nProof. We have [C\u03c6\u2217 , C\u03c6 ] = s(C\u03c6\u25e6\u03c3 \u2212 C\u03c3\u25e6\u03c6 ) + K where s is as in the statement of\nTheorem 3 and K is compact. Since a difference of non-compact linear-fractional\ncomposition operators is compact only if it is zero ([2], [18]), the result follows. \u0003\nA linear-fractional self-map whose fixed point set, relative to the Riemann sphere,\nconsists of a single point \u03b6 in \u2202D is termed parabolic. It is conjugate, via the map\n(\u03b6 + z)/(\u03b6 \u2212 z), to a translation by some complex number t, Re t \u2265 0, in the right\nhalf-plane. When Re t = 0 we have a (parabolic) automorphism; otherwise the map\nis not an automorphism. When the translation number t is strictly positive, we call\nthe associated linear-fractional self-map of D a positive parabolic non-automorphism.\nAmong the linear-fractional non-automorphisms fixing \u03b6 \u2208 \u2202D, the parabolic ones\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nare characterized by \u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6) = 1. For further details on the classification of linearfractional self-maps of D, see [3] or Chapter 0 of [22].\nA linear-fractional non-automorphism \u03c6 with a fixed point \u03b6 on \u2202D, which commutes with its Krein adjoint, must be parabolic. This follows by a consideration of\nfixed points: if \u03c6 has another fixed point z0 in the Riemann sphere, and it commutes\nwith \u03c3, then \u03c3(z0 ) would also be fixed by \u03c6. Neither \u03c3(z0 ) = \u03b6 nor \u03c3(z0 ) = z0 are\npossible, since \u03c3 fixes the boundary point \u03b6 if \u03c6 does, and \u03c6 fixes 1/z0 if \u03c3 fixes z0 .\nThus Corollary 2 gives another view of the main result in [3]: a non-automorphism\nlinear-fractional composition operator C\u03c6 is non-trivially essentially normal if and\nonly if \u03c6 is parabolic.\nProposition 1. Suppose \u03c6, not an automorphism, is a linear-fractional self-map\nof D with \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7 for some \u03b6, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D. If \u03c3 is the Krein adjoint of \u03c6, then\n\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7) = 1 and \u03c4 \u2261 \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3 is a positive parabolic non-automorphism.\n\nProof. Using  \u0303 for the Krein adjoint, we have \u03c6]\n\u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03c3\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3. Thus the map\n\u03c4 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3, a non-automorphism fixing \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D, is its own Krein adjoint. By the\nremark preceeding the statement of Proposition 1, this means that \u03c4 is parabolic\nand \u03c4 (z) = \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a6(z) + t) for \u03a6(z) = (\u03b7 + z)/(\u03b7 \u2212 z) and some t with Re t > 0.\nDirect calculation, using \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 , shows that t must be positive.\nSince parabolic non-automorphisms have derivative one at their (boundary) fixed\npoint ([22], p. 3), we have \u03c6\u2032 (\u03c3(\u03b7))\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7) = 1 or \u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7) = 1, as desired.\n\u0003\nThe spectrum of a composition operator whose symbol is a parabolic nonautomorphism has been described in [8]. In particular, we have the following result.\nProposition 2. [8] Let \u03c4 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3, where \u03c6 is a non-automorphism with \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7\nfor \u03b6, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D. The spectrum, \u03c3(C\u03c4 ), and essential spectrum \u03c3e (C\u03c4 ), are both equal\nto [0, 1].\nProof. The map \u03c4 fixes \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D, and by conjugating by a rotation, C\u03c4 is unitarily\nequivalent to a composition operator with positive parabolic symbol fixing 1. Such\na map can be written as\n(2 \u2212 t)z + t\n\u2212tz + 2 + t\nfor some positive t. Applying Corollary 6.2 in [8], we have \u03c3(C\u03c4 ) = [0, 1]. Since\nevery point of \u03c3(C\u03c4 ) is a boundary point of the spectrum, and none is isolated, we\nalso have \u03c3e (C\u03c4 ) = \u03c3(C\u03c4 ) = [0, 1] ([6], Theorem 37.8).\n\u0003\nAs promised, we can describe the scalar s appearing in Theorem 3 in a more\nuseful way:\nProposition 3. Let \u03c6, \u03c3 and s be as in the statement of Theorem 3. We have\ns = |\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7)| = |\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)|\u22121 .\nProof. Direct calculation shows that\n\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7)\n\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nc\u03b6 + d\n\u2212b\u03b7 + d\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\nBy Proposition 1, \u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6) = (\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7))\u22121 , so that s2 = |\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7)|2 . By Theorem 3, C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 \u2261\nsC\u03c6 C\u03c3 (mod K) = sC\u03c3\u25e6\u03c6 , and by Proposition 2, the essential spectrum of C\u03c3\u25e6\u03c6\nis [0, 1]. Since C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 is positive, the scalar s must be positive, and we have s =\n|\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b7)|.\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nTHOMAS L. KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\nCorollary 3. If \u03c6 is a non-automorphism, linear-fractional map with \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7 for\nsome \u03b6, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D, then \u03c3e (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) = \u03c3e (C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) = [0, s].\nProof. We have C\u03c6\u2217 \u2261 sC\u03c3 (mod K) for s = 1/|\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)| by Theorem 3 and Proposition 3. Thus C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 \u2261 sC\u03c3\u25e6\u03c6 (mod K) and C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 \u2261 sC\u03c6\u25e6\u03c3 (mod K), and the\nconclusion follows from Proposition 2 and Proposition 3.\n\u0003\nNote that since the non-zero points in \u03c3(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) and \u03c3(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) are the same, we\nalso have \u03c3(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) = \u03c3(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ). Moreover, this common spectrum consists of [0, s]\nplus at most finitely many eigenvalues greater than s, and of finite multiplicity.\n4. THE UNITAL C \u2217 -ALGEBRA GENERATED BY C\u03c6 AND Tz\nThroughout this section, \u03c6 will be a fixed but arbitrary linear-fractional self-map\nof D satisfying the following:\n(i) \u03c6 is not an automorphism.\n(ii) \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u03b7 for some \u03b6 6= \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202D.\nConditions (i) and (ii) imply that C\u03c62 is compact on H 2 , since k\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c6k\u221e < 1.\nThe algebra C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ) is the closed linear span of all words in Tz , Tz\u2217 , C\u03c6 , C\u03c6\u2217\nand I, and contains all Toeplitz operators Tw with w continuous. We set A =\nC \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 )/K, and denote the cosets of C\u03c6 , C\u03c6\u2217 , and Tw by x, x\u2217 , and tw , respectively. Let e denote the coset of the identity. A main goal of this section is\na description of A. This description will allow us, for example, to determine the\nessential norm and essential spectrum of any element of C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ). For \u03c6 as described above, E(\u03c6) = {\u03b6}, and Corollary 1 implies that Tw\u2212w(\u03b6)C\u03c6 is compact,\nthat is,\nTw C\u03c6 \u2261 w(\u03b6)C\u03c6 (mod K).\nSince E(\u03c3) = {\u03b7}, we also see from Corollary 1, Theorem 3, and Proposition 3\nthat\nC\u03c6 Tw\n\n=\n\n(Tw C\u03c6\u2217 )\u2217\n\n\u2261\n\ns(Tw C\u03c3 )\u2217 (mod K)\n\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\ns(w(\u03b7)C\u03c3 )\u2217 (mod K),\nw(\u03b7)C\u03c6 (mod K)\n\nwhere s = |\u03c6(\u03b6)|\u22121 . In addition, Tv Tw \u2212 Tvw is compact whenever v and w are in\nC(\u2202D). Phrasing these relations in terms of the cosets yields\n\u2022 tw x = w(\u03b6)x\n\u2022 xtw = w(\u03b7)x\n\u2022 tw x\u2217 = w(\u03b7)x\u2217\n\u2022 x\u2217 tw = w(\u03b6)x\u2217\n\u2022 tv tw = tvw\nfor all w and v in C(\u2202D). Since x2 = (x\u2217 )2 = 0, we generate A as a Banach space\nfrom linear combinations of\ntw , (x\u2217 x)m , (xx\u2217 )n , x(x\u2217 x)j , x\u2217 (xx\u2217 )k ,\nwhere w \u2208 C(\u2202D), the integers m, n are positive, and the integers j and k are\nnon-negative.\nLet K be a compact subset of the non-negative real numbers which contains\n[0, s]. We write C0 (K) for the space of functions in C(K) which vanish at zero. We\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nwill need the next result, which follows easily from the Hahn-Banach theorem and\nthe Riesz Representation Theorem; here t denotes the independent variable.\nLemma 1.\n(i) Let R and S be dense linear manifolds in C0 (K) and C(K),\nrespectively.

Then\nt\u03b1 T = {f \u2208 C0 (K) : f (\u03bb) = 0}.\nWe next introduce the various objects which are central to our analysis and\nrecord some observations about them.\n4.1. THE C \u2217 -ALGEBRA C. It follows from the relations described above that\nfor every continuous function w on \u2202D, tw commutes with x\u2217 x and xx\u2217 . Further,\nif we let C\u03b6,\u03b7 denote the algebra of all w in C(\u2202D) satisfying w(\u03b7) = w(\u03b6), then\ntw commutes with x and x\u2217 whenever w lies in C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D). Finally note that the\nself-adjoint element a \u2261 xx\u2217 + x\u2217 x commutes with both x and x\u2217 . The spectrum\nof a is easily identified:\nProposition 4. Let x be the coset of C\u03c6 in A, where \u03c6 = (az + b)/(cz + d)\nsatisfies conditions (i)-(ii) stated at the beginning of Section 4. If a = xx\u2217 + x\u2217 x,\nthen \u03c3(a) = \u03c3(xx\u2217 ) \u222a \u03c3(x\u2217 x) = [0, s] where s = 1/|\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)|.\nProof. The elements x\u2217 x and xx\u2217 generate a commutative C \u2217 -algebra. It follows\nfrom Gelfand theory, the facts that (xx\u2217 )(x\u2217 x) = (x\u2217 x)(xx\u2217 ) = 0, and (by Corollary 3) \u03c3(xx\u2217 ) = \u03c3(x\u2217 x) = [0, s], that \u03c3(a) = \u03c3(xx\u2217 ) \u222a \u03c3(x\u2217 x).\n\u0003\nLet C denote the (necessarily commutative) C \u2217 -algebra generated by a and the\nToeplitz cosets {tw : w \u2208 C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D)}. Clearly, C lies in the center of A. We next\ndescribe the Gelfand theory of C. First we look at the algebra C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D).\nIt is easy to see that the multiplicative linear functionals on C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D) are all\npoint evaluations\nl\u03bb : f \u2192 f (\u03bb)\n\nwith the proviso that l\u03b7 = l\u03b6 . Accordingly, the maximal ideal space of C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D)\nis a \"figure eight\", namely, the circle \u2202D with \u03b6 and \u03b7 identified. We denote by \u039b\nthe disjoint union of \u2202D and [0, s], with \u03b6, \u03b7 and 0 identified to a point p (a figure\neight with an interval attached). Given w in C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D), let us agree to extend w\ncontinuously to \u039b by setting w(\u03bb) = w(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7) when \u03bb = p or 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s.\nSimilarly, if f \u2208 C0 ([0, s]), extend f continuously to \u039b by putting f (p) = f (0) = 0\nand f (\u03bb) = 0 for \u03bb \u2208 \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}. With these understandings, which remain in force\nthroughout, we have the following result.\nProposition 5. The algebra C consists of all elements of the form b = tw + f (a)\nwhere w is in C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D) and f is in C0 ([0, s]). Moreover, b uniquely determines w\nand f . The maximal ideal space of C coincides with \u039b, and the Gelfand transform\nfrom C to C(\u039b) has the form\ntw + f (a) \u2192 w + f.\n\n\f8\n\nTHOMAS L. KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\nProof. We temporarily write C0 for {tw + f (a) : w \u2208 C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D) and f \u2208 C0 ([0, s])}.\nIf w(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7) and f is in C0 ([0, s]), then, since f is a uniform limit of polynomials\nvanishing at zero (and (x\u2217 x)(xx\u2217 ) = 0), we have\ntw f (a) =\n=\n=\n\ntw (f (x\u2217 x) + f (xx\u2217 ))\nw(\u03b7)f (x\u2217 x) + w(\u03b6)f (xx\u2217 )\nw(\u03b6)f (a).\n\nSince tw tv = twv for continuous w and v, we see that C0 is an algebra.\nSuppose l is a multiplicative linear functional on C. Restricting l to\n{tw : w \u2208 C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D)} \u223c\n= C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D)\n\nwe see that there is a unique \u03b1 \u2208 \u2202D with l(tw ) = w(\u03b1) for all continuous w with\nw(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7). Restricting l to\n{f (a) : f \u2208 C([0, s])} \u223c\n= C([0, s])\nshows that there is a unique point \u03b2 in [0, s] with l(f (a)) = f (\u03b2). Thus\nl(tw f (a)) = l(tw )l(f (a)) = w(\u03b1)f (\u03b2).\n\nAlso, if f (0) = 0, then tw f (a) = w(\u03b6)f (a) as seen above, so l(tw f (a)) = w(\u03b6)f (\u03b2).\nSince any function in C0 ([0, s]) vanishes at 0, we can have \u03b1 \u2208 \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7} if \u03b2 = 0,\nbut if 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 s, \u03b1 \u2208 {\u03b6, \u03b7}. Thus with the understandings stated prior to the\nstatement of the proposition, l(tw + f (a)) = w(\u03bb) + f (\u03bb) for a unique \u03bb in \u039b and\nany tw + f (a) in C0 .\nThe above arguments show that C(\u039b) is the Gelfand representation for C. Moreover, the map\ntw + f (a) \u2192 w + f\nfrom C0 to C(\u039b) is an isometric \u2217- homomorphism from C0 to C(\u039b). But C(\u039b)\nconsists of exactly such sums w + f , so this \u2217-homomorphism is onto C(\u039b). Since\nC(\u039b) is complete, so is C0 . Since C0 is dense in C, we conclude C0 = C.\n\u0003\n4.2. THE POLAR DECOMPOSITION OF C\u03c6 AND THE ALGEBRA\nA0 . We begin with some observations on the \u221a\npolar decomposition of any operator\nT on a Hilbert space H. Suppose that T = U T \u2217 T , where U is a partial isometry\nwith initial space (ker T )\u22a5 = T \u2217 H and final space T H = (ker T \u2217 )\u22a5 . The operators\nU \u2217 U and U U \u2217 are, respectively, the projections onto (ker T )\u22a5 and T H. Moreover,\nU T \u2217 T = T T \u2217 U and so\n(5)\n\nU f (T \u2217 T ) = f (T T \u2217)U\n\nfor all functions continuous on the spectra of both T \u2217 T and T T \u2217. Taking f to\u221abe the\nsquare root function shows that the polar decomposition for T \u2217 is T \u2217 = U \u2217 T T \u2217.\nThe partial isometry U is unitary if T and T \u2217 are one-to-one. Observe that every\nnon-trivial composition operator is one-to-one, and the adjoint formula of Equation (4) guarantees that, for linear-fractional composition operators, the adjoint is\nalso one-to-one. Thus the linear-fractional composition\noperators under considerap\ntion here have the polar decomposition C\u03c6 = U C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 where U is unitary. If we\n\u221a\n\u221a\np\napply these remarks to T = C\u03c6 = U C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 , we have x = u x\u2217 x and x\u2217 = u\u2217 xx\u2217\nwhere u = [U ], the coset of U modulo K, and x = [C\u03c6 ]. Moreover, as observed\nabove, U , and hence u, are unitary. By Corollary 3, the sets \u03c3(x\u2217 x) = \u03c3e (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 )\nand \u03c3(xx\u2217 ) = \u03c3e (C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) both coincide with [0, s], where s = |\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)|\u22121 .\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nNow C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ) is the closed linear span of elements of the form\nTw , f (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ), g(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ), C\u03c6 p(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ), C\u03c6\u2217 q(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ), K,\nwhere f, g, p and q are polynomials with f (0) = g(0) = 0, w is in C(\u2202D), and K\nis a compact operator. The map f \u2192 f (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) extends to a \u2217- isomorphism of\nC0 (\u03c3(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 )) onto the closed subspace {f (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) : f \u2208 C0 (\u03c3(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ))} in B(H 2 );\nthe analogous statement holds for the map g \u2192 g(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ).

We will\nsee later that A0 = A; for now we show that A0 is an algebra, and each element\nof A0 has a unique representation in the above form. To this end, we record some\nconsequences of the next pair of equations, which follow from Equation (5) by\ntaking cosets and adjoints:\n(7)\n\nuf (x\u2217 x) = f (xx\u2217 )u and u\u2217 f (xx\u2217 ) = f (x\u2217 x)u\u2217\n\nfor all f \u2208 C([0, s]).\nProposition 6. If A0 is defined as above, then A0 is an algebra.\nProof. We must show that given elements b1 \u2208 A0 and b2 \u2208 A0 having the form\nbj = twj + fj (x\u2217 x) + gj (xx\u2217 ) + uhj (x\u2217 x) + u\u2217 kj (xx\u2217 ), j = 1, 2\n\nwith wj \u2208 C(\u2202D) and fj , gj , hj , kj in C0 ([0, s]), then b1 b2 has the same form. To do\nthis, it suffices to show that that the product of any of the five terms of b1 with any\nof the five terms of b2 is again in A0 . Some of these verifications are immediate, for\nexample f1 (x\u2217 x)f2 (x\u2217 x) = f1 f2 (x\u2217 x), where f1 f2 is in C0 ([0, s]) if f1 and f2 are.\nFor the others, we make use of the basic equations of (7) together with:\n(8)\n\nf (x\u2217 x)g(xx\u2217 ) = 0 = g(xx\u2217 )f (x\u2217 x)\n\nfor f and g in C0 ([0, s]). Equation (8) follows by uniformly approximating f and g\nby polynomials vanishing at 0. From these equations we see that\n\u2022 g1 (xx\u2217 )uh2 (x\u2217 x) = ug1 (x\u2217 x)h2 (x\u2217 x),\n\u2022 uh1 (x\u2217 x)g2 (xx\u2217 ) = 0,\n\u2022 uh1 (x\u2217 x)uh2 (x\u2217 x) = uh1 (x\u2217 x)h2 (xx\u2217 )u\u2217 = 0,\n\u2022 uh1 (x\u2217 x)u\u2217 k2 (xx\u2217 ) = h1 (xx\u2217 )uu\u2217 k2 (xx\u2217 ) = h1 (xx\u2217 )k2 (xx\u2217 ),\n\u2022 u\u2217 k1 (xx\u2217 )uh2 (x\u2217 x) = u\u2217 uk1 (x\u2217 x)h2 (x\u2217 x) = k1 (x\u2217 x)h2 (x\u2217 x), and\n\u2022 u\u2217 k1 (xx\u2217 )u\u2217 k2 (xx\u2217 ) = u\u2217 k1 (xx\u2217 )k2 (x\u2217 x)u\u2217 = 0.\nSimilarly we see (using the coset identities preceeding Lemma 1) that for f, g, h,\nand k in C0 ([0, s]) and w \u2208 C(\u2202D),\n\n\f10\n\nTHOMAS L.

For an element b in A0 , there is a unique w \u2208 C(\u2202D) and unique\nfunctions f, g, h and k in C0 ([0, s]) so that Equation (6) holds.\nProof. It suffices to show that if\n0 = tw + f (x\u2217 x) + g(xx\u2217 ) + uh(x\u2217 x) + u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 ),\n\n(9)\n\nthen each term on the right-hand side is zero.

Thus h \u2261 0 and f + w(\u03b7) \u2261 0 on [0, s]; since f (0) = 0, we must have\nw(\u03b7) = 0 and f \u2261 0. Thus Equation (9) is now\n0 = tw + g(xx\u2217 ) + u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 ).\nMultiplying on the left by xx\u2217 gives\n0 =\n=\n\nxx\u2217 tw + xx\u2217 g(xx\u2217 ) + xx\u2217 u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 )\nw(\u03b6)xx\u2217 + xx\u2217 g(xx\u2217 ) + xx\u2217 u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 )\n\nso that\n\u2212[w(\u03b6)xx\u2217 + xx\u2217 g(xx\u2217 )] = xx\u2217 u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 ) = 0.\nIt follows that g + w(\u03b6) \u2261 0 on [0, s]; since g(0) = 0, we see that w(\u03b6) = 0 and\ng \u2261 0 on [0, s]. Returning again to Equation (9) we have\n0 = tw + u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 ).\nMultiplying on the left by x\u2217 x yields\n0 =\n=\n\nx\u2217 xtw + x\u2217 xu\u2217 k(xx\u2217 )\nw(\u03b7)x\u2217 x + x\u2217 xk(x\u2217 x)u\u2217 .\n\nSince w(\u03b7) = 0, this forces k \u2261 0, and from this it follows finally that tw = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\n4.3.

For \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, ker \u03a6\u03bb = I\u03bb .\n\nProof. For \u03bb in \u039b, denote by I\u03bbalg the two-sided algebraic ideal in A0 generated by\nJ\u03bb . Since ker \u03a6\u03bb is an ideal containing J\u03bb , we know\nJ\u03bb \u2282 I\u03bbalg \u2282 ker \u03a6\u03bb .\nBy definition, I\u03bb = I\u03bbalg . It suffices to show that ker \u03a6\u03bb \u2282 I\u03bbalg , for then we will\nhave\nI\u03bb = I\u03bbalg \u2282 ker \u03a6\u03bb \u2282 I\u03bbalg = I\u03bb ,\n\nwhich gives the desired conclusion.\nConsider first the case 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s. An element b in A0 , given by Equation (6),\nlies in ker \u03a6\u03bb exactly when w(\u03b6) + g(\u03bb), w(\u03b7) + f (\u03bb), h(\u03bb) and k(\u03bb) are all zero.\nWe claim that the sum of the first three terms on the right side of Equation (6) lie\nin I\u03bbalg . To see this, pick m and n in C(\u2202D) with m + n \u2261 1, m(\u03b6) = 0, m(\u03b7) = 1,\nand n(\u03b6) = 1, n(\u03b7) = 0. Then w = mw + nw so that tw = tmw + tnw . To prove the\nclaim, it is enough to show that both tmw + f (x\u2217 x) and tnw + g(xx\u2217 ) lie in I\u03bbalg .\nConsider tmw + f (x\u2217 x)\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nCase 1: w(\u03b7) 6= 0. Putting m1 = mw/w(\u03b7), we see that\ntmw + f (x\u2217 x) =\n=\n\n=\n\ntmw + m1 (\u03b7)f (x\u2217 x) + m1 (\u03b6)f (xx\u2217 )\ntm1 w(\u03b7) + tm1 (f (x\u2217 x) + f (xx\u2217 ))\ntm1 (tw(\u03b7) + f (a)).\n\nSince w(\u03b7) is constant (and hence lying in C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D)) and w(\u03b7) + f (\u03bb) = 0, tw(\u03b7) +\nf (a) lies in J\u03bb , so tmw + f (x\u2217 x) \u2208 I\u03bbalg .\nCase 2: w(\u03b7) = 0. If m and n are as above, mw vanishes at both \u03b6 and \u03b7. Fix a\nclosed arc I in \u2202D whose interior contains \u03b6, but with \u03b7 not in I. This time, define\nm1 = |mw|1/2 on I, m1 > 0 on \u2202D\\I, and m1 (\u03b7) = 1. Let w1 be mw/|mw|1/2\nwhen mw 6= 0 and 0 otherwise. Note that w1 is continuous and mw = m1 w1 on\n\u2202D. Thus\ntmw + f (x\u2217 x) =\n\ntmw + m1 (\u03b7)f (x\u2217 x) + m1 (\u03b6)f (xx\u2217 )\n\n=\n\ntm1 w1 + tm1 (f (x\u2217 x) + f (xx\u2217 ))\n\n=\n\ntm1 (tw1 + f (a)).\n\nSince w1 (\u03b6) = w1 (\u03b7) = 0 and f (\u03bb) = 0, tw1 + f (a) lies in J\u03bb . We conclude that\ntmw + f (x\u2217 x) is in I\u03bbalg in Case 2, as well as Case 1. A similar argument shows that\ntnw + g(xx\u2217 ) lies in I\u03bbalg in both cases, thus proving the claim.\n\nNext we show that the fourth term in b, uh(x\u2217 x), is in I\u03bbalg . If p is continuous\non [0, s], with p(0) = p(\u03bb) = 0, then p(a) lies in J\u03bb . Thus xp(x\u2217 x) = xp(a) is in\n\u221a\n\u221a\nI\u03bbalg . Writing x = u x\u2217 x, we see that xp(a) = u x\u2217 xp(x\u2217 x). According to (ii)\nof Lemma 1, the closure of such objects includes our fourth term uh(x\u2217 x), so that\nuh(x\u2217 x) is in I\u03bbalg . Similarly, I\u03bbalg contains u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 ), the fifth term of b, so that b\n\nis in I\u03bbalg as desired. This completes the proof for 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s.\nNext we consider the case \u03bb = p = {0, \u03b6, \u03b7}, the triple point in \u039b. Recall\nthat if f is in C0 ([0, s]), then f (p) = f (0) = 0, while any w in C\u03b6,\u03b7 (\u2202D) satisfies\nw(p) = w(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7). An element b of A0 , specified by Equation (6), lies in the\nkernel of \u03a6p exactly when w(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7) = 0. We want to show that ker \u03a6p \u2282 Ipalg .\nLet m and n be as described above. For f in C0 ([0, s]),\ntm f (a)\n\n= tm (f (x\u2217 x) + f (xx\u2217 ))\n= m(\u03b7)f (x\u2217 x) + m(\u03b6)f (xx\u2217 )\n= f (x\u2217 x),\n\nand similarly, for g \u2208 C0 ([0, s]), tn g(a) = g(xx\u2217 ). Thus f (x\u2217 x) and g(xx\u2217 ) lie in\nIpalg . If w(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7) = 0, then tw lies in Jp \u2282 Ipalg . As noted above for the case\n\n0 < \u03bb \u2264 s, uh(x\u2217 x) and u\u2217 k(xx\u2217 ) both lie in I\u03bbalg and thus so does b, establishing\nthe conclusion for \u03bb = p.\nFinally, if \u03bb is in \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}, note that J\u03bb consists of those elements tw + f (a)\nwith w(\u03bb) = 0, while the elements of ker \u03a6\u03bb have the form given by Equation (6),\n\nwith w(\u03bb) = 0. It follows easily (and similarly), that I\u03bbalg contains ker \u03a6\u03bb in this\ncase as well.\n\u0003\nProposition 10. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u039b.\n(i) If 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s, A/I\u03bb is \u2217-isomorphic to M2 .\n(ii) A/Ip is \u2217-isomorphic to Mdiag\n.\n2\n\n\f14\n\nTHOMAS L. KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\n(iii) If \u03bb is in \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}, A/I\u03bb is \u2217-isomorphic to {cI2\u00d72 : c \u2208 C}.\nProof. For an ideal I in an algebra B, we write [b]I throughout for the coset in B/I\nof an element b in B. First suppose 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s. Since ker \u03a6\u03bb \u2282 A0 \u2229 I\u03bb , we may\ndefine a \u2217-homomorphism\n\u0393\u03bb : A0 /ker \u03a6\u03bb \u2192 A0 /(A0 \u2229 I\u03bb )\n\nby\n\n\u0393\u03bb ([b]ker\n\n\u03a6\u03bb )\n\n= [b](A0 \u2229I\u03bb ) .\n\nBy Proposition 8 we know that A0 /ker \u03a6\u03bb is \u2217 -isomorphic to M2 ; write this isomorphism as T\u03bb : M2 \u2192 A0 /ker \u03a6\u03bb . Thus we have a sequence of onto \u2217- homomorphisms\n(14)\n\nM2 \u2192 A0 /ker \u03a6\u03bb \u2192 A0 /(A0 \u2229 I\u03bb ) \u2192 (A0 + I\u03bb )/I\u03bb ,\n\nwhere the first map is T\u03bb , the second is \u0393\u03bb and the last, call it R\u03bb , is provided by\nthe first isomorphism theorem for rings (see, for example, p. 105 in [16]) and has\nthe form\nR\u03bb : [b]A0 \u2229I\u03bb \u2192 [b]I\u03bb .\nSince A0 is dense in A, so is A0 + I\u03bb , and we have (A0 + I\u03bb )/I\u03bb both dense in\nA/I\u03bb and finite-dimensional. Therefore\n(A0 + I\u03bb )/I\u03bb = A/I\u03bb .\n\nThus we have a homomorphism S\u03bb = R\u03bb \u25e6 \u0393\u03bb \u25e6 T\u03bb from M2 onto A/I\u03bb . Since\nM2 has no non-trivial ideals, the kernel of S\u03bb is either M2 or {0}. Since A is a\nC \u2217 -algebra, I\u03bb 6= A (see [1], p. 33), and thus our homomorphism is injective; that\nis M2 \u223c\n= A/I\u03bb .\nNext consider (ii), with \u03bb = p. We repeat the above argument, but this time,\nby Proposition 8, we may replace M2 on the left side of (14) by Mdiag\n. Again,\n2\nonto\nA/I\n.\nHowever,\nthe above argument yields a homomorphism Sp from Mdiag\np\n2\nunlike M2 , Mdiag\ncontains two non-trivial ideals, namely\n2\n(15)\n\n\u001a\u0014\n\na\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u0015\n\n:a\u2208C\n\n\u001b\n\nand\n\n\u001a\u0014\n\n0 0\n0 b\n\n\u0015\n\n\u001b\n:b\u2208C .\n\nAgain, Ip 6= A and so ker Sp is either {0} or one of these two ideals. If it is the\nfirst ideal in (15), then Sp induces an isomorphism of C and A/Ip whose inverse\nhas the form\n[b]Ip \u2192 w(\u03b7)\nwhen b is given by Equation (6). In particular, for b = tw , we see that\nk[tw ]Ip k = |w(\u03b7)|.\n\nHowever, for 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s, we know that\n\u0014\n\u0015\nw(\u03b6)\n0\nk[tw ]I\u03bb k =\n0\nw(\u03b7)\n\nM2\n\n= max{|w(\u03b6)|, |w(\u03b7)|}.\n\nThe map \u03bb \u2192 k[b]I\u03bb k is known to be upper semi-continuous on \u039b (see [1], Theorem\n1.34), which implies that for each w in C(\u2202D),\nmax{|w(\u03b6)|, |w(\u03b7)|} = lim sup k[tw ]I\u03bb k \u2264 k[tw ]Ip k = |w(\u03b7)|.\n\u03bb\u21930\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n15\n\nThis is clearly impossible. Thus ker Sp cannot be the first ideal in (15), or similarly,\nthe second. Therefore, Sp has kernel {0} and provides an isomorphism of Mdiag\n2\nand A/Ip , proving (ii).\nFinally, for (iii), one can repeat the general argument from (i), with \u03bb \u2208 \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7},\nreplacing M2 in (14) by {cI2\u00d72 : d \u2208 C} \u223c\n= C, an algebra with no non-trivial ideals.\nOne easily checks that the isomorphism S\u03bb\u22121 from A/I\u03bb into M2 is given for b\nin A0 by\nS\u03bb\u22121 : [b]I\u03bb \u2192 \u03a6\u03bb (b).\n\nBy Equation (10), S\u03bb\u22121 , and thus S\u03bb , are manifestly \u2217\u2212maps.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2. For future reference, we note that by the above proof, the composition\nS\u03bb of the three homomorphisms in (14) is an isomorphism, and thus the map \u0393\u03bb is\nan isomorphism of A0 /ker \u03a6\u03bb and A0 /(A0 \u2229 I\u03bb ). In other words, ker \u03a6\u03bb = A0 \u2229 I\u03bb .\nBy Proposition 8 and Proposition 10, we have \u2217-isomorphisms\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 M2 when 0 < \u03bb \u2264 s,\n(16)\nA/I\u03bb \u223c\nMdiag when \u03bb = p,\n=\n= A0 /ker \u03a6\u03bb \u223c\n\uf8f3 2\n{cI2\u00d72 : c \u2208 C} when \u03bb \u2208 \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7},\nthe composition being S\u03bb\u22121 . The objects on the right are C \u2217 \u2212algebras, so that S\u03bb\u22121\nis isometric.

We write D for the range of \u03a6. According\nto the above results and Douglas' theorem, kbkA = sup\u03bb\u2208\u039b k\u03a6\u03bb (b)k, so that \u03a6 is\nan isometric \u2217-isomorphism of A0 onto the \u2217-algebra D. It is easy to verify that D\nconsists of all\n\u0015\n\u0014\nf11 f12\nF =\nf21 f22\nin B(\u039b, M2 ) such that each fij is continuous on {p} \u222a (0, s) and \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}, f12\nand f21 vanish at p and on \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}, f11 = f22 on \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}, while f11 (p) =\nlim\u03bb\u2192\u03b6 f11 (\u03bb) and f22 (p) = lim\u03bb\u2192\u03b7 f22 (\u03bb), the limits being taken as \u03bb \u2192 \u03b6 or\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03b7 through points in \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7}. One easily checks that D is closed in B(\u039b, M2 ).\nSince \u03a6 is isometric, A0 is complete. Since A0 is dense in A, we can close the circle\nto obtain the following result.\nProposition 11. The algebra A0 coincides with A, and ker \u03a6 = I\u03bb .\n\n\f16\n\nTHOMAS L. KRIETE, BARBARA D. MACCLUER, AND JENNIFER L. MOORHOUSE\n\nLet us define two closed subspaces M and N in A:\n\nM \u2261 {f (x\u2217 x) : f \u2208 C0 ([0, s])}, N \u2261 {g(xx\u2217 ) : g \u2208 C0 ([0, s])}.\n\nWe have already seen that A0 is an algebraic direct sum of the closed subspaces\n{tw : w \u2208 C(\u2202D)}, M, N , uM and u\u2217 N . Since A0 = A, a Banach space, we have\nthe following corollary.\nCorollary 4. As a Banach space, A = C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 )/K has the direct sum decomposition\nA = {tw : w \u2208 C(\u2202D)} \u2295 M \u2295 N \u2295 uM \u2295 u\u2217 N .\nIn summary we have the following:\n\nTheorem 4. The map \u03a6 is a \u2217-isomorphism of A onto D.\n\nRemark 3. Given the form of the algebra D, it is not hard to show that every\nirreducible representation of C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 )/K is unitarily equivalent either to one of\nthe two-dimensional representations \u03a6\u03bb , \u03bb in (0, s], or to one of the scalar representations l\u03bb : b \u2192 w(\u03bb), \u03bb in \u2202D, where b is given by Equation (6).\n\n4.4. C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ) REVISITED AND THE MAP \u03a8. Let E and F be the spectral\nprojections of C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 and C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 respectively, which are associated to their common\nessential spectrum [0, s]. We have\nand\n\nC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 = EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E + (I \u2212 E)C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 (I \u2212 E)\n\nC\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 = F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F + (I \u2212 F )C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 (I \u2212 F ).\nNotice that the second term on the right-hand side of each of these expressions is a\nfinite rank operator. Thus if f and g are continuous on \u03c3(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) = \u03c3(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ), then\n(18)\n\nf (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) = f (EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E) + K1 , g(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) = g(F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F ) + K2\n\nfor finite rank operators K1 and K2 . Also note that the maps f \u2192 f (EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E)\nand g \u2192 f (F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F ) are isometries from C0 ([0, s]) onto closed subspaces M and\nN in C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ).\nTheorem 5. As a Banach space, C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ) is the direct sum of closed subspaces:\n(19)\n\nC \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ) = {Tw : w \u2208 C(\u2202D} \u2295 M \u2295 N \u2295 U M \u2295 U \u2217 N \u2295 K.\n\nProof. Given B \u2208 C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ), the coset b = [B] satisfies Equation (6) for unique\nw \u2208 C(\u2202D) and f, g, h and k in C0 ([0, s]). Since the coset map B \u2192 [B] is\none-to-one when restricted to each of the first five direct summands (for example, [U h(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 )] = uh(x\u2217 x)), we see that\n(20) B = Tw + f (EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E)+ g(F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F )+ U h(EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E)+ U \u2217 k(F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F )+ K\nfor a unique compact operator K.\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2217\n\nNow consider the map \u03a8 : C (Tz , C\u03c6 ) \u2192 D defined by \u03a8(B) = \u03a6([B]).

THE DENSE SEMI-POLYNOMIAL SUBALGEBRA P. We write P\nfor the dense non-commutative semi-polynomial \u2217\u2212 algebra consisting of finite linear combinations of all Tw , w in C(\u2202D), all words in C\u03c6 and C\u03c6\u2217 , and all compact\noperators. Every element of P has the form\n(21)\n\nB = Tw + f (C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) + g(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) + C\u03c6 p(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 ) + C\u03c6\u2217 q(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 ) + K,\n\nwhere w is in C(\u2202D), f, g, p and q are polynomials with f (0) = 0 = g(0), and K\nis compact. Cutting C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 and C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 down by the spectral projections E and F\nrespectively, we find\nq\nB = Tw + f (EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E) + g(F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F ) + U E C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 p(C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 )E\nq\n+ U \u2217 F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 q(C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 )F + K \u2032 ,\n\nwhere we have absorbed each of the finite ranks arising from Equations (18) into the\nnew compact operator K \u2032 . By Theorem 5, B determines each of the six summands\nhere. Since f, g, p and q are polynomials, and so are determined by their restrictions\nto [0, s], the decomposition of B in Equation (21) is unique. Since C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 \u2212 sC\u03c6\u25e6\u03c3\nand C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 \u2212 sC\u03c3\u25e6\u03c6 , are compact, we see that Equation (21) becomes\nB = Tw + A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + K \u2032\u2032\n\nwhere K \u2032\u2032 is compact, and A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 are finite linear combinations of composition operators whose associated self-maps of D are taken from the respective\nlists (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3)n1 , (\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6)n2 , (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3)n3 \u25e6 \u03c6, and (\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6)n4 \u25e6 \u03c3, for integers n1 , n2 \u2265 1\nand n3 , n4 \u2265 0, where \u03c4n denotes the nth iterate of the map \u03c4 . Since all of these\nself-maps are distinct, Corollary 5.17 in [18] says the corresponding composition\noperators are linearly independent modulo K. Thus the operator B determines\nthe coefficients in each of the sums A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , and w and K \u2032\u2032 as well. We\nsummarize these observations in the following theorem.\nTheorem 7. Every operator in P is a sum of a unique Toeplitz operator with continuous symbol, a unique compact operator and a unique finite linear combination\nof composition operators with associated disk maps taken from the set\n{(\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3)n1 , (\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6)n2 , (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3)n3 \u25e6 \u03c6, (\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6)n4 \u25e6 \u03c3}\n\nwhere nk \u2265 1 for k = 1, 2 and nk \u2265 0 for k = 3, 4.\n\nFor an operator B given by Equation (21), the matrix function \u03a8(B) can properly\nbe called\n\u221a the \"symbol of B\".

The essential spectrum of the real part of C\u03c6 is the interval [\u2212 s/2, \u221a s/2],\nwhere s = |\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6)|\u22121 . This follows from using f (t) = g(t) = 0 and h(t) = k(t) = t\nin Theorem 8 to see that\n\u221a \u221a\n\u03c3e (C\u03c6 + C\u03c6\u2217 ) = [\u2212 s, s].\nExample 2. The essential spectrum of the self-commutator [C\u03c6\u2217 , C\u03c6 ] is [\u2212s, s].\nThis is obtained from Theorem 8, using f (t) = t, g(t) = \u2212t, and k(t) = h(t) = 0.\nSimilarly, the anti-commutator C\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 + C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 has essential spectrum [0, s].\nExample 3.

Then \u03c3e (B1 ) is the\nparabolic curve y 2 + iy, \u22121 \u2264 y \u2264 1.\nExample 4. Let\n1\nB2 = C\u03c6\u25e6\u03c3 \u2212 C\u03c3\u25e6\u03c6 + C\u03c6 \u2212 C\u03c3 ,\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nso that f (t) = t/s, g(t) = \u2212t/s, h(t) = t/2 and k(t) = \u2212 t/s. Then \u03c3e (B2 ) is\nthe union of two complex line segments, [\u2212 \u221a12 , \u221a12 ] and [\u2212 4i , 4i ].\nExample 5. Let\nB3 = 2C\u03c6\u25e6\u03c3 + C\u03c6 \u2212 C\u03c3 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nso that f (t) = 2t/s, g(t) = 0, h(t) = t and k(t) = \u2212 t/s. Here \u03c3e (B3 ) is the\ncircle of radius 12 centered at z = 21 .\nNext we look at the effect of adding a Toeplitz operator. Consider an operator\nB = Tw + Y given by Equation (20), with\nY = f (EC\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 E) + g(F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F ) + U h(EC\u03c6\u2217 C\u03c6 E) + U \u2217 k(F C\u03c6 C\u03c6\u2217 F ) + K.\nAccording to Theorem 8, adding Y to Tw does not affect the part of the essential\nspectrum coming from \u03c3e (Tw ) = w(\u2202D). If w takes a common value c at the points\n\u03b6 and \u03b7, Theorem 8 also implies that\n\u03c3e (B) = \u03c3e (Tw ) \u222a \u03c3e (cI + Y ).\nIn this case, the effect of adding Tw , on the part of the essential spectrum coming\nfrom Y , is to merely translate it by c. However if w(\u03b6) 6= w(\u03b7), adding Tw can\nnon-trivially deform Y \u2032 s contribution to \u03c3e (B).\n\n\fTOEPLITZ-COMPOSITION C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n19\n\nExample 6. For r \u2265 0, suppose w in C(\u2202D) satisfies\n\n1+i\n1+i\nw(\u03b7) = r \u221a , w(\u03b6) = \u2212r \u221a .\n2\n2\n\u2217\nLet B = Tw + Y where Y = C\u03c6 + C\u03c6 . Taking f, g, h, and k as in Example 1, we\nsee from Theorem 8 that\np\n\u03c3e (B) = w(\u2202D) \u222a {\u00b1 t + r2 i : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 s}.\nThus when r = 0 (so that w(\u03b6) = w(\u03b7) = 0),\n\u221a \u221a\n\u03c3e (B) = w(\u2202D) \u222a [\u2212 s, s] = \u03c3e (Tw ) \u222a \u03c3e (Y ).\n\nHowever, when r > 0, adding Tw to Y disconnects the\u221aessential spectrum\nof the\n\u221a\nlatter operator,\ndeforming\nthe\ntwo\nhalves\nof\n\u03c3\n(Y\n),\n[0,\ns]\nand\n[\u2212\ns,\n0],\ninto\nthe\ne\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncurves { t + r2 i : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 s} and {\u2212 t + r2 i : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 s}, respectively. The first\nof these curves lies in the open first quadrant, is convex, and falls downhill to the\nright. The second, of course, is its reflection through the origin.\nFinally, we consider essential norms. If B in C \u2217 (Tz , C\u03c6 ) is given by Equation (20), we know that the essential norm kBke is given by\nkBke = sup k\u03a6\u03bb ([B])kM2 .\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nExample 7. Let B = Tz + C\u03c6 + C\u03c6\u2217 . Here we have w(ei\u03b8 ) = ei\u03b8 , f (t) = g(t) = 0\n\u221a\nand h(t) = k(t) = t. If \u03bb is in \u2202D\\{\u03b6, \u03b7} or \u03bb = p, then \u03a6\u03bb ([B]) is a diagonal\nunitary matrix.
