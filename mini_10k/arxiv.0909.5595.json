Studies have shown that warm dust in the inner regions of massive, optically\nthick disks survives for a period of order \u223c3-5 Myr (e.g. Strom et al. 1989; Beckwith et al.\n1990). Very few objects in transition between this primordial state and the optically thin\ndebris disk systems first discovered by IRAS (Aumann et al. 1984; Rieke et al. 2005) are\nknown, making difficult the identification of a sample of this important, short-lived phase.\nOne indicator of intermediate systems is the presence of an inner hole or gap indicating that\nthe inner disk has evolved while the outer disk has not. The presence of gaps may indicate\nthat planets have already formed in the disks and cleared the material around their orbits.\nSuch systems can therefore strongly constrain models of planet formation, especially the role\nof gap formation and disk-planet interactions in various planet migration scenarios that lead\nto the creation of \"hot Jupiters\" found to orbit much older systems (Marcy et al. 2005). It\nis therefore essential to search for other types of evidence that either support or reject the\ngap hypothesis.\nIn theory, an inner gap in a proto-planetary disk can be identified from a depressed\nSED at wavelengths of 1-15 \u03bcm, as the absence of hot dust close to the star results in flux\ncoming solely from the stellar photosphere, rather than disk surface emission. To date, such\nemission \"deficits\" are the tool most widely used to infer the presence of gaps (Brown et al.\n2007, Calvet et al. 2002, Forrest et al. 2004), but spectrophotometric signatures are indirect\nand notoriously difficult to interpret as multiple physical scenarios can result in the same\nSED (Boss & Yorke 1996). Additional constraints and detailed models are therefore required\nto distinguish between the possible physical scenarios that are consistent with the observed\nfluxes.\nThe relatively new field of submillimeter interferometry provides access to the small\nscales necessary for examining inner disk structure. Submillimeter imaging is optimal for\ntransitional disk studies as the sources are intrinsically stronger than at longer centimeter\nand near-millimeter wavelengths. The spatial filtering possible with arrays can also suppress\nthe contamination produced by the weak extended emission from nearby molecular cloud\nmaterial that is routinely picked up by single dish measurements of the submillimeter flux.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nLong baselines and good (u, v) coverage are vital to provide the high resolution/high dynamic\nrange imaging needed to resolve the gaps. Because submillimeter observations trace optically\nthin emission in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, the data are exquisitely sensitive to the mass\nsurface density profile in the disk. However, only the brightest disks are suitable for resolving\ndisk structure and few transitional disks have been studied on the scales necessary to resolve\nthe central hole (LkCa 15 - Pi\u00e9tu et al. 2006; TW Hya - Hughes et al. 2007; LkH\u03b1 330 Brown et al. 2008; GM Aur - Dutrey et al. 2008, Hughes et al. 2009; SR 21N - Andrews et al.\n2009).\nHere we present further examples supporting the gap hypothesis in the form of 340\nGHz (880 \u03bcm) continuum maps resolving the inner disk holes in the disks around LkH\u03b1\n330, SR21 and HD 135344B. Details about the sources and relevant observational details are\npresented in Section 2. We then turn to a discussion of the results and their implications for\nSED-driven searches for gaps in circumstellar disks.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nMid-IR spectrophotometry of LkH\u03b1 330, SR 21N and HD 135344B was acquired as\npart of the Spitzer \"From Cores to Disks\" (c2d) Legacy Science project. Out of a sample\nof over 100 spectra in the c2d first look program, chosen from known T Tauri stars, only 5\ndisks (LkH\u03b1 330, SR 21 N, HD 135344 B, T Cha, and CoKu Tau 4) showed SED features\ncharacteristic of an inner hole (Brown et al. 2007). Those disks visible from the northern\nhemisphere and with suitably large disk masses \u2013 LkH\u03b1 330, SR 21N and HD 135344B \u2013 have\nbeen targeted for high spatial resolution follow-up imaging at submillimeter wavelengths.\nLkH\u03b1 330 is a little studied G3 star near the IC 348 region of Perseus, which is a sparse\ncluster with stars between a few to ten million years old (Strom et al. 1974). The distance\nto Perseus is an unresolved problem with values ranging from 200 to 350 pc. A distance of\n250 pc is assumed here following the c2d convention.\nSR 21N (a.k.a. Elias 2-30) is a 3 Myr old pre-main sequence binary, with a separation of 6.\u2032\u2032 4, in the core of the \u03c1 Ophiucus cloud at a distance of 160 pc (Prato et al. 2003).\nThe primary has a spectral type of G2.5, while the companion has spectral type M4. A\nrecent VLT/NACO AO survey found no other companions (Correia et al. 2006). Interestingly, Prato et al. (2003) found that the two companions were not coeval within their limits,\nalthough large uncertainties remain. The disks of the two components are closely aligned\nindicating that the stars are likely gravitationally bound but the distance between the two\nis large enough that we do not expect significant gravitational perturbations to the SR 21N\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndisk, particularly in the inner regions. (Jensen et al. 2004).\nHD 135344B is an 8 Myr old F4 star in Lupus that lies \u223c20 arcseconds from its A-type\ncompanion HD 135344A. The two stars are likely not physically associated. The dust disk\naround HD 135344B has been spatially resolved in UV scattered light (Grady et al. 2005;\nGrady & all 2009) and the mid-IR (Doucet et al. 2006). However, the two observations\nprovide different disk inclinations of <20\u25e6 (Grady & all 2009) and 46\u25e6 (Doucet et al. 2006).\nA close (0.\u2032\u2032 32 separation) binary system lies 5.\u2032\u2032 8 to the southwest (Augereau et al. 2001). A\ndistance of 84 pc in agreement with Dunkin et al. (1997) was used in Brown et al. (2007).\nA further distance of 140 pc has been suggested by van Boekel et al. (2005) and provides a\nbetter simultaneous fit of the SMA image and SED.\nDust emission measurements were acquired with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) using\nthe very extended configuration with the eight 6 meter diameter antennae, which provided\nbaselines ranging in length from 30 to 590 m. The observations of LkH\u03b1 330 in 2006 November were taken with only seven antennae and the minimum length baseline was 80 m. Double\nsideband (DSB) receivers tuned to 341.165 GHz provided 2 GHz of bandwith/sideband, centered at an Intermediate Frequency (IF) of 5 GHz. Calibration of the visibility phases was\nachieved with observations of a quasar within 10 degrees of the source (listed in Table 1),\ntypically at intervals of 25 minutes. 3C273 was used as the passband callibrator in all observations. Measurements of one of Uranus, Titan and Callisto provided the absolute scale\nfor the flux density calibration. Uncertainties in the flux scale are estimated to be 15%.\nTable 1 lists the observed source position, the synthesized beam size with natural weighting,\nsingle DSB system temperatures, the phase and flux callibrators and the observation dates.\nComparison of the millimeter source positions with the optical stellar positions (marked with\ncrosses in Figure 1) show that within the position errors the millimeter emission is centered\non the star. SR 21 N has the least accurate optical position and has the largest difference\nbetween the two positions. HD 135344B and SR 21N have higher system temperatures and\nmore elongated beams than LkH\u03b1 330. The data were calibrated using the MIR software\npackage (http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/\u223ccqi/mircook.html), and processed with Miriad\n(Sault et al. 1995).\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nData\n\nImage plane\n\nThe SMA images clearly resolve the size, orientation and radial structure in all three\ndisks (see Figure 1). The parameters found directly from the data are summerized in Table\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2. The total fluxes, Ftotal , were found by integrating all disk flux above a 3-sigma noise cutoff\nand the peak S/N ranged from 25-75 for the three disks (Table 2, columns 2 and 3). The\nhole radii, Rhole , (column 4) are in good agreement with the SED-determined values. The\nouter disk edge, Rdisk , is also resolved. Due to the lower optical depths in the outer disk,\nthis high resolution imaging is likely not sensitive to the outermost reaches of the disk, so\nthe radii in column 6 are lower limits. For all three disks, upper limits on the integrated flux\nwithin the hole, Fhole , were derived (column 7). The SR 21N hole is smaller than those in\nthe other disks and barely resolved, so the flux decrement is not as well constrained. In the\nLkH\u03b1 330 image, the flux within the hole is below the 1 sigma noise level of 2.3 mJy/beam.\nUsing the flux to disk mass conversion of Beckwith et al. (1990), which implicitly assumes\na gas to dust ratio of 100, limits on the amount of mass in the hole on the order of 10\u22124\nM\u2299 were calculated (column 8). In the case of LkH\u03b1 330, the significant intensity contrast\nbetween the inner and outer disk indicates a large mass surface density contrast \u2013 even for\nmm-sized grains.\nThe millimeter inclinations were found by assuming a circular disk and deprojecting\nthe minor axis after correcting for the beam. The unusual geometries and asymmetries\nintroduce fairly large systematic errors into these results. In the case of HD 135344B, the\ninclination agrees better with HST scatter light images of the outer disk (Grady & all 2009)\nthan resolved 20\u03bcmimages (Doucet et al. 2006). The large asymmetry, seen also in the\nHST images, is a potential cause of the inclination discrepancy, particularly for inclinations\nderived from lower spatial resolution data.\n\n3.2.\n\n(u,v) plane\n\nWith a sufficiently sharp transition, aperture synthesis observations should detect a\nnull in the flux versus (u, v)-distance for disks with gaps, as opposed to the smooth drop\noff in flux associated with power-law mass surface density profiles that characterizes most\nclassical T Tauri star disks (Andrews & Williams 2007). A visibility domain analysis also\nprovides a more straightforward means of assessing the uncertainties in any fits, as the\ndata have not been affected by the Fourier transforms and non-linear deconvolution inherent to CLEAN/MEM routines. The visibility data were averaged in concentric ellipses of\ndeprojected (u,v) distance to account for disk inclination, i, and\np position angle, PA (e.g.\nHughes et al. 2007). Thus, the deprojected (u,v) distance is R = d2a + d2b with da = R sin\u03c6\nand and db = R cos\u03c6 cos i where \u03c6 = arctan(v/u \u2212 PA). The disks are all close to face-on\nand deprojecting the (u,v) distance does not make a large difference compared to a simpler\nannular average. All three disks do indeed show nulls (see Figure 2), the values of which are\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nlisted in Table 2.\n\n3.3.\n\nSpectral energy distributions\n\nThe dust grains that emit at 10 \u03bcm versus 1 mm are very different in size, and may\ntherefore arise from very different populations. Thus, it is of interest to examine in detail\nwhether the SED-derived disk structure is in agreement with that dictated by the SMA\nimages. The total 880 \u03bcm flux from the SMA observations was included in the photometry\nto check the overall flux in relation to other measurements (see the star-labeled points in\nFigure 3). The integrated fluxes do fit well with the other submillimeter measuements\nin the log-log plots. On average, however, the fluxes are slightly lower than other data,\nand the (u,v)-plane data indicate a flux deficit on the shortest spacings as compared with\nthe model. This is likely due to the lack of short baselines in the very extended SMA\nconfiguration. Fits to the optical through millimeter-wave SED yield estimated gap outer\nradii for all three disks between 20 and 50 AU (see Brown et al. 2007), which are roughly\nin agreement with the images. The largest discrepancy is in SR 21 where the millimeter\nhole is significantly bigger than that found from fitting the SED. Such differences could arise\neither from incorrect parameterization of the central star in the model or from an intrinsic\ndifference in the distribution of different sized grains.\n\n4.\n\nModeling\n\nThe 2-D radiative transfer model RADMC (Dullemond & Dominik 2004), as modified to\ninclude a density reduction simulating a gap, was used to simultaneously model the resolved\nimages (see Figure 4), the data in the (u,v)-plane (see Figure 2), and the SEDs (see Figure\n3). This model assumes a passive disk, which merely reprocesses the stellar radiation field.\nIn order to fit the missing dust emission, the model was adapted to reduce the dust density\nin a specific region to create a gap in the disk. The resulting image was resampled in Miriad\nusing the same (u,v)-plane distribution as the SMA data so the two are directly comparable\n(see Figure 4).\nIn the model, the disk is assumed to be flared such that the surface height, H, varies\nwith radius, R, as H/R \u221d R2/7 , as in Chiang & Goldreich (1997). As in Brown et al. (2007),\nthe models do not calculate the hydrostatic equilibrium self-consistently, and the pressure\nscale height is anchored at the outer disk edge, in this case 300 AU, in agreement with values\npredicted from hydrostatic equilibrium. Density is a power law of radius with an index of\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n-1. The dust composition is set to a silicate:carbon ratio of 4:1 with only amorphous, rather\nthan crystalline, silicate included. The grain sizes range from 0.01 \u03bcm to 10 cm with a\npower-law index of -3.5 and a total disk mass, including both gas and dust, of \u223c0.02 M\u2299\n(Osterloh & Beckwith 1995). The inner edge of the disk, RDisk,in, was set at approximately\nthe radius where the dust sublimation temperature, 1500 K, is reached.\nThe gap is represented in the model by three parameters: both an inner and an outer\ngap radius and a density reduction factor. The models were determined based primarily on\nthe SED models found using \u03c72 minimization on the inner and outer gap radii in Brown et al.\n(2007). However, in the case of HD 135344B the SED model at 84 pc resulted in a hole of 1.\u2032\u2032 1,\nsignificantly larger than that seen in the SMA image. In order to resolve this discrepancy, a\nrevised distance of 140 pc and increased stellar luminosity was used (as in van Boekel et al.\n2005), providing good agreement between the SED and image. The SED best fit models\nmatched the images remarkably well, lending confidence to current SED interpretation and\nmodeling. Both the image and the SED indicate that the gap in the LkH\u03b1 330 disk has\nan outer radius of 47 AU. HD 135344B has a hole radius of 39 AU, while SR 21N has the\nsmallest hole with a radius of 33 AU. The null in the (u,v) plane provides the strongest\nconstraint on the model, limiting good fits to within \u00b14 AU or a tenth of a beam. Large\ndifferences in the initial model parameters or distances could result in larger errors. The\nSMA images places no constraint on the inner gap radius, but the SEDs require hot dust\nwith temperatures normally only found at <1 AU. The models thus have a narrow ring of hot\ngas extending to 0.45 AU for SR 21N and HD 135344B and 0.8 AU for LkH\u03b1 330. Within\nour solar system, this gap corresponds to the area between Earth's orbit and distances just\nbeyond Pluto's orbit.\n\n4.1.\n\nDensity contrast\n\nThe LkH\u03b1 330 hole is largely empty of dust, and the intensity contrast between the hole\nand the outer disk is large, indicating a similarly large mass surface density contrast. The\nbest fit models for all three disks have density reductions of 1000 within the hole. In the\nLkH\u03b1 330 disk, this corresponds to 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 of material, compared to less than 1.3\n\u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 derived from the image. For comparison, the model without the hole contains\nsome 0.01 M\u2299 of material within the same region. SR 21N and HD 135344B, with their\nmore gradual gap edges, have less well defined density contrasts and more material within\nthe holes. Limits on the amount of material in the hole are 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 and 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\nM\u2299 , respectively.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.2.\n\nGap edge\n\nFor all of the disks, the inner hole exhibits a relatively steep rise in dust emission to the\nouter disk and can be modelled satisfactorily with a step function density reduction. In order\nto investigate the abruptness of the transition between the inner and outer disk, a gap edge\nwas introduced so that the density reduction rises logarithmically over a range of radii, REdge ,\naround the outer gap radius. This effect is similar to moving the hole radius inwards but\nover large scales the two disk structures can be distinguished. Figure 2 shows models with\ndifferent values of REdge /RHole compared to the data. LkH\u03b1 330 is best fit by the steepest\nprofile as might be expected from the large intensity contrast between the hole and outer\ndisk. However, both HD 135344B and SR 21N can be fit well with much shallower slopes\nin density reduction, REdge /RHole up to 0.5. A steep transition is more likely to originate\nfrom the gravitational influence of a companion body than from a process expected to show\na more shallow gradient like grain growth.\n\n4.3.\n\nAsymmetries\n\nThe most prominent asymmetry in the images is due to the inclination of the disks.\nThe edges where more dust lies along the line-of-sight are brighter, creating two bright\nregions along the major axis. However, other significant asymmetries remain which cannot\nbe explained by an axisymmetric disk model (see Figure 4). Such asymmetries could arise\nfrom gravitational perturbation caused by a large planet or binary companion.\nThe disk around HD 135344B is the most asymmetric with an almost horseshoe shape,\nso much so that modeling with an axisymmetric disk can never provide a good fit. The vast\nmajority of the disk material lies to the south/southeast, with a cleared region in the ring to\nthe north (see Figure 4). In order to quantitatively measure the amount of asymmetry, the\nratios of integrated flux on the two sides of both the major and minor axes were measured.\nIn all cases the asymmetries are larger around the minor axes. For HD 135344B, the flux\nratio around the major axis is 1.3 but the large visible asymmetry around the minor axis is\n2.2 \u2013 although the difference from the brightest point to its counterpart on the other side\nis a factor of 10. Both SR 21N and LkH\u03b1 330 are more symmetric. SR 21N has a flux\nasymmetry of 1.1 around the major axis and 1.4 around the minor. LkH\u03b1 330 has only a\nslight asymmetry around the major axis and 1.3 around the minor.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have directly imaged large inner gaps in three young protoplanetary disks. The\nobserved sizes are in excellent agreement with those found through SED-based fits. Synthetic\nimages, produced by the 2D radiative transfer code used to model the SEDs, fit the data\nwell, although the asymmetry of the HD 135344B disk poses problems with the axisymmetric\nmodel used. The limits from the SMA images on the amount of material within the holes\nare also in agreement with the models and reveal a significant reduction in dust in the inner\nregions. For all of the disks, the inner hole exhibits a relatively steep rise in dust emission\nto the outer disk.\nWhile the SMA images provide a large amount of information about the outer regions of\nthe disk, information regarding the structure close to the star must come from other sources.\nThe presence of material close to the star, making the density reduction a gap rather than a\nhole, places constraints on many gap producing processes. At present, the only indications of\ndust close to the star are the 1-10 \u03bcm excesses. All the models require a hot dust component\nto fit the near-IR excess in the SEDs, modeled in this paper as a ring of matter close to\nthe star. However, the SEDs place no spatial constraints on the source of this emission.\n? find inner dust between 0.05 AU and 1.8 AU in HD 135344B which is consistent with\na ring model as presented here. On the other hand, Eisner et al. (2009) find that mid-IR\naperture masking visibilities of SR 21N are incompatible with a compact ring of emission.\nThey preferentially model this near-IR excess as a low mass companion. However, there is\nlittle positive evidence of such a companion, with the expected degree of asymmetry not\nseen in either their own data or in 5 \u03bcm CO data (Pontoppidan et al. 2008; Pontoppidan,\npriv. comm.). In either case, the amount of mass in these scenarios is negligible compared\nto the outer disk and cannot be distinguished from the millimeter data presented here.\nThere are several indications that gas must reside close to the stars. First, LkH\u03b1 330\nand HD 135344B display H \u03b1 emission, with equivalent width measurements ranging from\n11 to 20 \u00c5 (Fernandez et al. 1995, Cohen & Kuhi 1979), and so are still accreting gas.\nAdditionally, van der Plas et al. (2008) found [O I] emission from within the dust gap in\nHD 135344B. SR 21N, on the other hand, does not appear to still be accreting or only very\nweakly (Natta et al. 2006). Second, emission from warm (800 - 1000 K) gas is seen in the\n4.7 \u03bcm v=1\u21920 rovibrational emission lines of CO from all three sources (Pontoppidan et al.\n2008, Salyk et al. 2009). Pontoppidan et al. (2008) spatially resolved the warm CO emission\nin SR 21N and HD 135344B using spectro-astrometery, and placed the inner edge of the gas\nemission regions at 7 AU and 0.5 AU, respectively.\nFormation of these dust holes by planetary companions would be the most exciting explanation for their presence, and extensive theoretical work has been done to fit transitional\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ndisk observations with models of disks with planets (Varni\u00e8re et al. 2006). Theories reconciling the presence of gas within the planet-induced holes include dust filtration (Rice et al.\n2006) and gas transport by magneto-rotational instability (Chiang & Murray-Clay 2007).\nHowever, other processes which might form a hole may be effective and must be considered.\nStellar mass companions in close binary orbits remain one of the most likely causes of inner\ndisk holes and the SEDs show the defining characteristics of a transitional SEDs (e.g. CoKu\nTau 4, Forrest et al. 2004, Ireland & Kraus 2008; CS Cha, Espaillat et al. 2007). Although\nno companions are currently known in these disks, low mass binary companions are difficult\nto detect without dedicated searches. Interferometric aperture-masking observations with\nNIRC2 on Keck reveal that LkHa330 and SR 21 have no companions with masses of > \u223c50\nMJupiter , at separations larger than \u223c10 and \u223c5 AU, respectively (M. Ireland and A. Kraus,\nprivate communication).\nOne proposed process for quickly clearing the inner disk region is photoevaporation\n(Clarke et al. 2001, Alexander et al. 2006). An inner hole occurs when the photoevaporation\nrate driven by the ionizing flux from the central star matches the viscous accretion rate.\nHowever, this condition is only effectively fulfilled when accretion rates are low and would\nresult in no gas or dust close to the star for gap radii of several tens of AU. Photoevaporation\nis thus extremely unlikely to be responsible for the 27-40 AU radii gaps observed in the LkH\u03b1\n330, HD 135344B and SR 21N disks (Salyk et al. 2009).\nAn alternative explanation to physical removal of the dust is that it has grown beyond\nthe size at which it efficiently radiates as a blackbody so that it no longer emits strongly in\nthe mid-IR and submillimeter (Tanaka et al. 2005). Within any realistic distribution of dust\ngrain sizes, even a minimum grain diameter of 50 \u03bcm significantly overproduces the flux in\nthe 10 \u03bcm region with no density reduction. Thus, grain growth to very large sizes with little\nfragmentation in collisions is needed for this scenario to be relevant for these transitional\ndisks and seems unlikely from a theoretical point of view (Brauer et al. 2008). The sharp\ncutoffs in dust mass surface density between the inner and outer disk in LkH\u03b1 330 and Hd\n135344B are also difficult to reconcile with dust coagulation models alone.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nTo summarize, LkH\u03b1 330, HD 135344B and SR 21N present dramatic cases of disks\nevolving from the inside out rather than smoothly throughout all radii as would be expected\nin (constant) alpha-viscosity models of disk evolution. The gaps are largely empty of dust\nbut gas does remain, and the outer edge of the gaps rise steeply. Importantly, the good\nagreement of both data and model lends confidence to current interpretations of SEDs with\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nsignificant dust emission deficits being due to inner holes in disks. Further SED-based\nsearches can therefore be expected to yield numerous additional candidates that can be\nexamined at high spatial resolution. Ultimately, in such studies it will be critical not only\nto image the dust but to provide estimates of the gas:dust ratios in the outer and inner\ndisk if the different possible gap creation scenarios are to be disentangled. A combination\nof spatially resolved submillimeter imaging, ultimately with the Atacama Large Millimeter\nArray (ALMA), and high resolution infrared and millimeter-wave spectroscopy to trace the\ngas content will provide the key observations to drive our future understanding of these\nfascinating objects.\n\nREFERENCES\nAlexander, R.
