Depending on the time when such action\nis taken, the end can be speeded up or slowed down, or even averted all together. This phenomenon\noffers practical applications for the stabilization of entangled quantum states. Details concerning\nhastening or delaying the finite time end of entanglement are presented for two qubits which decay\nspontaneously into statistically independent reservoirs.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 03.65.Yz, 03.65.Ud, 03.65.Ta\n\nEntanglement is a key feature of the quantum physics\nof more than one particle. From its historical beginnings\n[1] to the current practical interest in it as a core resource\nfor the field of quantum information sciences [2], this\nproperty of quantum systems continues to fascinate and\nto shed new light onto the nature of our quantum world.\nThe fields of quantum computing, quantum cryptography\nand key distribution [3], and quantum teleportation[4] all\nrely on having entangled states of two qubits. Since each\nqubit is inevitably subject to decoherence and decay processes, no matter how much they may be screened from\nthe external environment, it is important to consider possible degradation of any initially established entanglement. In particular, there has been increasing discussion\nof what has been called \"sudden death\", a finite time\nwhen the entanglement disappears even under decoherence mechanisms which may be only asymptotic in time\n[5, 6, 7]. Clearly, such finite time disappearance of entanglement can seriously affect its application in any of\nthe above fields.\nIt is well known in the context of spontaneous emission\nprocesses [9] or delayed choice experiments [10], for example, that characteristic quantum phenomena and effects\nof decoherence can be influenced significantly by suitable\nactions, such as measurements. Therefore, it would be\nof interest if A(lice) and B(ob), the two members of the\nentangled pair, can take suitable individual actions when\nfaced with the prospect of loss of entanglement to postpone that end. Some studies on changing the initial state\ninto an equivalently entangled but more robust state have\nbeen carried out [8]. In this Letter, we deal with the more\ndirect question that, even given an initial state and a set\nup which will end in disentanglement at finite time, can\nthey themselves take suitable actions later to change the\nfate of their entanglement. We answer in the affirmative. In particular, it is shown that simple local unitary\noperations can alter the time of disentanglement. This\nis even possible if these local operations are separated\nspacelikely so that they are not connected by any causal\nrelation. The operations we consider can either hasten or\ndelay that time depending on its time of application. A\nsuitable window for this application can even avert com-\n\npletely the finite or sudden death. In that case, entanglement will persist and decay only asymptotically just as\ndo the decoherences for both qubits. While our discussion will be for two qubits, it is clear that similar results\nwill apply also to other systems such as qubit-qutrit [11]\nand qutrit-qutrit [12, 13] where also questions of the finite end of entanglement have been considered. We will\npresent such results elsewhere.\nWe consider the model of two two-level atoms and \"amplitude damping\" in the form of spontaneous (pure exponential) decay into statistically independent reservoirs\nfrom the excited to the ground state being the only postulated dynamics [6]. Whatever the initial state, whether\npure or mixed, and whether entangled (non-separable) or\nnot, the final state reached in asymptotic time is clearly\none of both atoms in the ground state, that is, a product\nstate of the two ground-state atoms/qubits with no entanglement. It is also a pure state with zero entropy. The\nmuch discussed model [6] considers mixed states with a\ndensity matrix of the form\n\n\uf8f6\na(t) 0\n0\n0\n1 \uf8ec 0 b(t) z(t) 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\u03c1(t) = \uf8ec\n3 \uf8ed 0 z(t) c(t) 0 \uf8f8\n0\n0\n0 d(t)\n\uf8eb\n\n(1)\n\nThe coefficients (a, b, c, d, z) may be considered real, and\nTr \u03c1 = (a + b + c + d)/3 = 1. The four states are\ndescribed as usual by (| + +i, | + \u2212i, | \u2212 +i, | \u2212 \u2212i)\nwith Alice and Bob's states shown as the first and second entries, respectively, in the ket, and +/\u2212 denoting\nexcited/ground state. The initial condition chosen, of\nb(0) = c(0) = z(0) = 1, along with the only evolution,\nthat + decays to \u2212 at a steady rate exp(\u2212\u0393t/2) in amplitude, keeps b(t) = c(t) throughout.\nThe form of \u03c1(t) in Eq. (1) is preserved by time evolution. The off-diagonal density matrix element is given by\n\u017c(t) = \u2212\u0393z(t) (an overhead dot indicates differentiation\n\n\f2\nwith respect to time) and\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\u22122\u0393\n\u03c1++\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec \u0393\nd \uf8ec\n\u03c1\n+\u2212\n\uf8f7=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\ndt \uf8ed \u03c1\u2212+ \uf8f8 \uf8ed \u0393\n0\n\u03c1\u2212\u2212\n\nthe diagonal ones by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\u03c1++\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212\u0393 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03c1+\u2212 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u03c1\u2212+ \uf8f8\n0 \u2212\u0393 0\n\u03c1\u2212\u2212\n\u0393 \u0393 0\n\n\u221a\n\u0393t0 = ln(1/\u03b302 ) = ln(1 + 1/ 2).\n(2)\n\nNo elaborate derivation is necessary, these equations having an obvious structure dictated by the \"decay\" from +\nto \"feed\" into \u2212. Their solutions are also immediate.\nIn terms of a logarithmic, dimensionless time parameter,\n\u03b3 = exp(\u2212\u0393t/2), we have\n\u03c1++ (t) = a(t) = a(0)\u03b3 4\n\u03c1+\u2212 (t) = \u03c1\u2212+ (t) = b(t) = [b(0) + a(0)]\u03b3 2 \u2212 a(0)\u03b3 4\n\u03c1\u2212\u2212 (t) = d(t) = 3 + a(0)(\u03b3 4 \u2212\u03b3 2 )\u2212[3\u2212d(0)]\u03b3 2\nz(t) = z(0)\u03b3 2 .\n\n(3)\n\nWere (b, c, z) to be the only non-zero elements in\nEq. (1), we would have an entangled pure state (| + \u2212i +\n| \u2212 +i). The coefficients would all decay with a factor\n\u03b3 2 , and so would the entanglement only asymptotically.\nThe additional choice of either (a(0) = 1, d(0) = 0) or\n(a(0) = 0, d(0) = 1) gives a mixed state which is nonseparable.\nBoth choices give the same entropy, defined\nP\nas \u2212 \u03c1i ln \u03c1i in terms of the eigenvalues of \u03c1. This value\nis ln(3/41/3 ) at t = 0 and decreases to 0 asymptotically\nwhen the system is in the pure state | \u2212 \u2212i. But their\nevolution of entanglement or separability is very different\n[6, 14].\nVarious measures of entanglement all coincide in their\nconclusion that the second choice of d(0) = 1 leads\nto non-separability only asymptotically at infinite time\nwhereas the first choice with a(0) = 1 leads to a finite\ntime for the end of entanglement, the \"sudden death\"\n[6]. Concurrence [15] having been discussed in previous\npapers, we choose negativity as a more easily measurable\nquantity in terms of the partially transposed density matrix [16] as an indicator of non-separability.\nThe negativity is defined as the sum of the absolute\nvalues of all the negative eigenvalues of the partially\ntransposed density matrix [17] for a quantum state. For\nthe 2 \u2297 2 system, there can be at most one such possible negative eigenvalue [18]. Viewing Eq. (1) in terms\nof 2 \u00d7 2 blocks and transposing the off-diagonal blocks\nto define such a partial transpose, its eigenvalues contain one that can possibly be negative. This eigenvalue, or alternatively,\nsix times that value, is given by\np\na(t)+d(t)\u2212 [a(t) \u2212 d(t)]2 + 4z 2 (t), and it can take negative values so long as ad < z 2 . When a(0) = 0, since a(t)\nfrom Eq. (3) remains zero at all times, the system retains\nnon-separability for all finite t. However, for the choice\n(d(0) = 0, a(0) = 1), the system starts as non-separable\nor entangled but when a(t)d(t) crosses z 2 (t) during the\nsubsequent evolution, the entanglement is lost. It can be\nseen that the time t0 at which this happens is\n\n(4)\n\nThis is the time\u221aof \"sudden\npoint, we\n\u221a death\" [6]. At this\u221a\nhave a = 6 \u2212 4 2, b = 2 2 \u2212 2, d = 1, z = 2 \u2212 2.\nPrevious papers have examined the evolution of entanglement for different initial choices of the above parameters [6, 14]. The evolution of Werner states [19], with a\nform slightly different from the one in Eq. (1) with nonzero entries in the other two corners as well, has also been\nstudied [14]. It has also been noted that different \"initializations\", wherein an initial given state such as in Eq. (1)\nis switched to another with equivalent entanglement, can\nlead to a change in the time of non-separability [8]. A\nrecent paper has collected compactly necessary and sufficient conditions for this under both amplitude and phase\ndamping [20].\nAnother observation, with multimode radiation fields,\nis that spontaneous emission can also lead to a revival\nof entanglement from a separable configuration [21]. In\nthree-level atoms or qutrits, finite end of entanglement\nfor pairs and abrupt changes in lower bounds on entanglement have been noted [12], as also quantum interference between different decay channels creating an asymptotic entanglement [13]. The finite end phenomenon has\nalso been noted for mixed qubit-qutrit states [11] and it\nseems to be a generic phenomenon for all entangled-pair\nsystems.\nWe turn, however, to a different question, whether,\ngiven the qubit-qubit system above and initial conditions\nthat lead to separability in finite time, a suitable intervention may alter that time. Such a question is clearly\neven of practical interest because, as noted in [22], \"finite\nend may affect the feasibility of solid-state based quantum computing\". Therefore, a simple intervention that\nprolongs the entanglement resource can be of broad interest. Indeed, the above discussion and, especially, the\nasymmetry noted between the two choices of whether it\nis a or d that is initially zero, suggests a way for such\nan intervention. When a(t) = 0, the non-separability in\nthe mixed state because of the presence of d simply continues as the states that are entangled \"decay down\" to\nenhance d. The other situation of a(0) = 1 and, therefore, a non-zero a(t) is quite different, because it feeds\ninto the entangled sector \"from above\". At a crucial\npoint/time when ad > z 2 , which, as is especially clear\nfrom the partial transposed density matrix (see Eq. (1)),\nhas to do with the (| + +i, | \u2212 \u2212i) sector, it is this feed\nwhich swamps the entangled sector and makes the mixed\nstate separable.\nThe above diagnosis of which aspect of the asymmetry between a and d is responsible for the separability\nsuggests a \"switch\" between them. Such a switch, which\nleaves the other coefficients (b, c, z) unchanged, amounts\nto interchanging + and \u2212 for both qubits. This is a\nlocal unitary transformation that both Alice and Bob\n\n\f3\n\n0.25\n0.2\nN\n\n0.15\n\nGtend\n\n0.1\n0.05\nGtB\n0.2\n\nGtA\nGt0\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\nGt\n\n0.7\n\nFIG. 1: Evolution of negativity N with time for an initial\nmixed state in Eq. (1) with a(0) = b(0) = c(0) = z(0) =\n1, d(0) = 0. The solid line shows the undisturbed evolution,\nwith sudden death at \u0393t0 \u2248 0.5348. Other dotted and dashed\nlines show the effect of switching the values of a and d at\ndifferent times. Those after \u0393tA \u2248 0.2877 hasten, and those\nbefore delay, the sudden death. Switches earlier than \u0393tB \u2248\n0.1293 avoid sudden death altogether, negativity vanishing\nonly asymptotically in time.\n\ncan easily implement, by individual \u03c3x operations for\nspins or laser coupling of the excited and ground states\nfor two-level atoms. Consider the same initial condition as before, with (a(0) = 1, d(0) = 0), which leads\nto sudden death. Before the time t0 corresponding to\nthe end of entanglement, consider such local unitary operations that merely interchange a and d. If this is\ndone at the time tA when a = d, which happens when\n2\nexp(\u2212\u0393tA ) \u2261 \u03b3A\n= 3/4, clearly there will be no effect\nupon the subsequent evolution, the end still coming at\ntime t0 . See Figs. 1 and 2. If the switch is made at any\ntime intermediate between tA and t0 (see FIG. 2), separability occurs earlier, a minimum being at the switch\ntime \u0393t1 \u2248 0.357.\nMore interestingly, a switch earlier than tA prolongs\nthe entanglement as shown in the figures. Moreover,\nswitch times before tB with \u0393tB \u2248 0.1293 avoid the finite time end all together, leading to separability only\nasymptotically. As a practical matter, therefore, when\nAlice and Bob separate at t = 0 and know that they\nface an end to their entanglement at t0 , they can agree\nbeforehand to make the local unitary switch between +\nand \u2212 at a certain time as desired to alter that end.\nIn FIG 1, negativity is plotted against the parameter \u0393t. The solid line corresponds to a situation when\nno switch is made and the sudden death happens at\n\u0393t0 \u2248 0.5348. If the switch is made at \u0393t1 \u2248 0.357\n(dotted-dashed line), the sudden death reaches a minimum value of \u0393t< \u2248 0.48. Any switch made earlier than\ntA leads to a delay in sudden death in comparison with\nt0 . Two instances are shown in the upper curves.

Any switch made earlier\nthan \u0393tB \u2248 0.1293 avoids a finite end, leading only to\nasymptotic decay of entanglement.\nFIG 2 displays the time of sudden death tend against\nthe time of switching tsw . The earlier the switch is made\nthan \u0393tA \u2248 0.2877, the more the end of entanglement is\ndelayed. Sudden death is avoided completely when the\nswitch takes place earlier than \u0393tB \u2248 0.1293.\nInterestingly, switching + and \u2212 at only one end, that\nis, either Alice or Bob makes the local unitary \u03c3x transformation, also alters the end of entanglement. Now, a\nand c in the density matrix in Eq. (1) are interchanged,\nas also b and d, while z moves to the corners of the antidiagonal. The roles of (a, d) and (b, c) in Eq. (3) are\ninterchanged and we find that sudden death is hastened\nor delayed depending on the time of switching but it is\nnow no longer averted indefinitely. FIG. 3 shows the results to be contrasted with those in FIG. 2. A maximum,\nbut still finite, delay is obtained for the\u221a earliest switch\nat \u0393tsw = 0, its value \u0393tend = ln(3 + 5)/2 \u2248 0.9624\nbeing a little less than double that of \u0393t0 . A simple, analytical expression describes the curve in FIG. 3. With\nx = exp(\u2212\u0393tsw ), y = exp(\u2212\u0393tend ), we have\n\ny(x) =\n\n3\u2212\n\n\u221a\n9 \u2212 24x + 20x2\n.\n2(2 \u2212 x)\n\n(5)\n\nThe value\n\u221a of \u0393t0 in Eq. (4) corresponds to the root y =\nx = 2 \u2212 2.\nIn summary, we have shown that a simple local unitary\noperation that can be carried out on both qubits of an\nentangled pair changes the subsequent evolution of their\nentanglement. For mixed states under conditions which\nlead to a loss of that entanglement at finite time, termed\nsudden death, such an operation can either hasten or\ndelay that death, depending on the time at which it is\n\n\f4\n\n1\n[6]\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n[7]\n\nGtend 0.7\n0.6\n\n[8]\n\n0.5\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nGtmin\n0.3 0.4\nGtsw\n\nGt0\n0.5\n\nFIG. 3: As in FIG. 2 when the switch is done at only one\nend. Note that the maximum delay, which occurs at tsw = 0,\nis now finite.\n\ncarried out. There is a critical time before which the\noperation can even completely avert the sudden death\nof entanglement. When the local transformation is done\nat only one of the qubits, sudden death is hastened or\ndelayed but not averted completely.\nOne of us (ARPR) thanks the Theoretische Quantenphysik group at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt,\nfor its hospitality during the course of this work.
