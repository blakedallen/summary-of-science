A systematic study is made of crystals with a range\nof pore radii to tune the band gap relative to the emission frequency. The decay rates averaged\nover all dipole orientations are inhibited by up to a factor of 12\u00d7 in the photonic band gap, and\nenhanced up to 2\u00d7 outside the gap, in quantitative agreement with theory. We discuss the effects\nof spatial inhomogeneity, non-zero non-radiative decay, and transition dipole orientations on the\nobserved inhibition in the band gap.\n\nIn the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED)\nit has been recognized that the nano-environment of a\ntwo-level quantum system may serve to tailor the fundamental light-matter interactions [1, 2]. Of particular\ninterest is the broadband and radical suppression of vacuum fluctuations in a three-dimensional (3D) photonic\nband gap, i.e., a frequency range for which light is forbidden for all wave vectors and all polarizations [3]. Such\nband gaps are expected in 3D photonic crystals, i.e., dielectric nanostructures with periodicities less than half\nthe optical wavelength [4]. Anticipated cavity QED effects of band gaps include complete inhibition of spontaneous emission, photon-atom bound states, collective\nlaser-like emission, and intriguing fractional decay [5\u20139].\nTo date, the cavity QED effects of 3D photonic band\ngaps on two-level light sources have only been studied\nin theory [5\u20139]. In these studies, one usually considers\na single two-level source (or N identical ones) with ideal\n100% quantum efficiency that is excited once at t=0, and\nthat is placed in a perfect and infinitely extended photonic crystal. Clearly, this idealized situation differs from\nreal situations. Real sources are inhomogeneously broadened, have non-zero non-radiative decay, are repeatedly\nexcited in time, and are embedded in photonic crystals\nof finite extent. In this paper, we perform a first experimental study of cavity QED effects of real 3D photonic\nband gap crystals on embedded two-level light sources.\nTo this end, we have developed Si photonic crystals with\na diamond-like structure that have broad gaps [10]. We\nperform time-correlated single photon counting experiments on embedded semiconductor quantum dots and\nobserve broadband inhibition inside and enhancement\noutside the band gap. We notably find that the effects of\nspatial inhomogeneity, non-zero non-radiative decay, and\ntransition dipole orientations are relevant in the band\ngap. Our results allow for the first time to test predictions from several different theoretical models.\nSilicon 3D inverse woodpile photonic band gap crystals were fabricated by a CMOS-compatible method described in Ref. [11]. In brief, two orthogonal sets of pores\nare etched consecutively in a silicon wafer by reactive ion\netching after careful alignment. Fig. 1(a) shows a scan-\n\nning electron micrograph of a typical crystal. The cubic\ncrystals \u221a\nhave lattice parameters a = 693 and c = 488 nm\n(a/c = 2) and a range of pore radii (136 < r < 186\nnm) to tune the band gap relative to the emission spectrum. The 3D crystal extends over L3 = 12 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 12 ac2 ,\nwhich exceeds the Bragg length in every direction [12].\nThe good optical quality and high photonic strength of\nour crystals have been confirmed by optical reflectivity\nwhere intense and broad peaks are seen. The stopbands\noverlap for all probed directions and polarizations, which\nis an experimental signature of a photonic band gap [12].\nFig. 1(b) shows the calculated band structure [13] for\none of our inverse woodpile crystals. A broad band gap\nappears in the frequency range where modes are forbidden for all wavevectors. Fig. 1(c) shows the corresponding density of states (DOS). At low frequency the DOS increases quadratically as is typical of an effective medium.\nBeyond 0.35 the photonic regime is entered as the DOS\ndeviates from the parabola. The DOS completely vanishes in the photonic band gap between 0.478 and 0.504.\nTo study emission from two-level sources, we immersed\nthe crystals in suspensions of PbS colloidal quantum dots\nin toluene (Evident). The concentration was as low as\n2 * 10\u22126 M to avoid dot-dot interactions such as energy\ntransfer. The dots emit at photon energies between 0.8\nand 0.9 eV including the telecom range (Fig. 4), and\ntheir transition dipole orientations sample all directions.\nWe measured room temperature decay rates at three energies in the quantum dot spectrum: 0.828, 0.850, and\n0.893 eV (\u03bb = 1500, 1460, 1390 nm respectively). Outside the crystals the dots reveal single exponential decay\nwith an energy-independent rate. By keeping the dots\nin suspension the photophysical properties remain stable\nfor months, much longer than the short stability of dried\ndots in previous studies [14].\nThe quantum dots were excited with short (11 ps) light\npulses from a frequency-doubled Nd3+ :YAG laser (Time\nBandwidth Cougar) at \u03bb = 532 nm at a repetition rate\nof 409 kHz. The laser power was kept sufficiently low\nto avoid saturation and ensure that the dots remain in\nthe linear regime. Light collected from the quantum dots\nwas resolved by a monochromator (Acton 2500i) set to\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n0.2\n\n0.0\nR\n\nY S\n\nR T\n\nY\n\nX U\n\nWavevector\n\n0.0\nZ U R\n\n1.0\n\n/\n\n2\n\n3\n\nc )\n\n(c)\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\nDOS (\n\n(\n\na/2 c)\n\n(b)\n\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\nNormalised frequency\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nNormalised frequency (\n\n0.6\n\na/2 c)\n\nFigure 1: (color) (a) Scanning electron micrograph of a 3D\ninverse woodpile photonic crystal made from silicon.

The excitation light was focused with\nan NA=0.12; 4\u00d7 objective on the crystal, see Fig. 2(a).\nTo minimize background from the suspension, light from\nthe quantum dots was collected at 90\u25e6 from the excitation beam by a detection objective with NA=0.7; 100\u00d7.\nTo precisely align the crystal the excitation focus was\nscanned along the edge of the structure. Fig. 2(b) shows\na scan of intensity versus y-position of the excitation focus. We see a sharp transition from high (in suspension)\nto lower intensity in the crystal. In a scan performed on\nbulk silicon next to the crystal a sharp edge is also seen.\nHere the intensity is about half of the intensity collected\nfrom the photonic crystal. Hence about half of the intensity is emitted by quantum dots in the photonic crystal\n\nFigure 2: (a) Drawing of the crystal position relative to excitation and and detection foci. The coordinate system of the\nposition scans is shown. (b) Peak intensity of quantum dots\nat 0.842 eV (1475 nm) vs. y-position in an inverse woodpile\ncrystal (red squares) and near a silicon wafer (black circles),\ncurves are guides to the eye. The photonic crystal reveals\ntwice as much signal as bulk silicon. The measured intensities (P C, S) are input for the time-resolved emission model.\n\nwhile the other half stems from quantum dots in suspension. Therefore, we conclude that a significant spontaneous emission signal originates from quantum dots in\nour photonic band gap crystals.\nTo precisely measure the arrival time of the emitted\nphotons, time-correlated single photon counting was employed with a cooled photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu\nNIR) and a timing card (Picoquant PicoHarp 300). Since\nwe perform experiments at relatively low photon energy\nin the near infrared to avoid Si absorption, the detector darkcount is substantial (3 * 105 counts/s) and the\nquantum dot signal is relatively low (< 1% of the repetition frequency, or < 4 * 103 counts/s). Therefore, we have\ncollected for long times (hours) to obtain sufficient statistics, and carefully subtracted the background [15]. Fig. 3\nshows time-resolved spontaneous emission for quantum\ndots in two different photonic crystals with pore radii 170\nand 136 nm. The emission inside the bandgap (r = 170\nnm) decays slower than outside the bandgap (r = 136\n\n\f3\nNormalised frequency (a/ )\n0.46\n\nCounts\n\n10000\n\n2\n\n1000\n\n0\n\nr=170 nm\n\n0.50\n\n0.52\n\nspectrum\n\n(a)\n\nr=145 nm\n\n2\n\nr=136 nm\n\n3\n\n)\n\n5000\nPC\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n10\n\nr=170 nm\n\n1\n\nr=176 nm\n\n1\n\n1\n0.85\n\nnm), which confirms that the excited state lifetime of\nquantum dots is controlled by the photonic crystals.\nInterestingly, Fig. 3 reveals that the photon arrival\ntimes decay monotonously in time to a vanishing intensity, in agreement with Ref. [6]; we do not detect signatures of fractional decay or oscillations predicted in\nRefs. [7\u20139]. A possible reason for this discrepancy may\nbe that those predicted features are not robust to ensemble averaging. Other reasons could be the finite dynamic\nrange (1.5 decades) in our experiments, the assumption\nof very large oscillator strengths in some models, or that\ntheories predict excited-state population dynamics instead of photon arrival times while these two phenomena\ndo not necessarily have the same dynamics, see Ref. [16].\nSince the emission originates both from quantum dots\nin the crystal and in suspension, we model the timeresolved emission with a double-exponential:\nf (t) = I(S exp(\u2212\u03b3S t) + P C exp(\u2212\u03b3P C t)).\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03b3P C is the rate of quantum dots in the photonic\ncrystal that we wish to obtain, and \u03b3S is the rate of\ndots outside the crystal that is separately found to be\n\u03b3s = 1.9 \u03bcs\u22121 . S and P C are determined by scans of\nthe detection focus (see Fig. 2(b)). The high quality of\nour model is confirmed by residuals randomly distributed\nabout 0 (Fig. 3 bottom), and by the goodness of fit \u03c72red\nof 1.01 and 0.93 near unity. From Fig. 3 we obtain decay rates \u03b3P C = 3.1 \u03bcs\u22121 and 0.88 \u03bcs\u22121 for two different crystals. Therefore these data reveal respectively\nenhanced and inhibited emission compared to quantum\ndots in suspension.\nFig. 4 (a) to (c) collects the decay rates measured on\nseveral crystals with a range of pore radii and hence gap\nfrequencies.

Circles represent extremal\ndata since a lower inhibition is likely biased by dots outside\nthe crystal. The calculated inverse density of states (DOS)\nare shown as curves. The top panel shows the quantum dot\nemission spectrum.\n\nband gap range we plot the ratio \u03b3S /\u03b3P C . For all crystals a good agreement between the measured inhibition\nand the inverse DOS is observed. The agreement is much\nbetter than previously found in inverse opals [14], likely\nsince our quantum dots occupy a much larger fraction of\nthe unit cell thus providing a better average of the local\ndensity of states (LDOS) [17]. For the 145 nm crystal\n(Fig. 4(a)) the photon energy is higher than the band\ngap frequency. An enhanced decay rate up to 2\u00d7 is observed with increasing photon energy, in agreement with\nthe DOS. The 170 nm crystal (Fig. 4(b)) reveals up to a\n2-fold inhibition at frequencies just below the gap. Strikingly, a strong up to 12\u00d7 inhibition is found at photon\nenergies deep in the band gap where a minimum decay\nrate of 0.16 \u03bcs\u22121 is observed. The corresponding lifetimes up to T1 = 6.25 \u03bcs are extremely long for quantum\ndots, and confirm strongly shielded vacuum fluctuations,\nwhich is favorable for applications in quantum information processing [18]. The occurrence of a lower inhibition\nin the band gap may be caused by slight misalignments\nthat bias results to \u03b3S ; since the measurements take long\nit is conceivable that the alignment slowly drifts during\ndata collection.

In the band gap the LDOS decreases exponentially\naway from the crystal surface to a minimum < 10\u22122 , as estimated from Ref. [20]. Outside the gap the LDOS remains\nfinite, as shown for a pseudogap as in Ref. [14].\n\na clear inhibition of the decay rate inside the band gap\nin good agreement with the calculated density of states.\nUp to 12\u00d7 inhibition is observed, which agrees with the\nresults on the 170 nm crystal.\nAll theoretical studies predict strongly inhibited\nexcited-state lifetimes in the range of the band gap [5\u2013\n9]. Indeed we observe drastically inhibited emission in\nour photonic band gap crystals. Interestingly, the situation studied here leads to new physics since emission\nrates in real 3D photonic band gaps will reveal spatial\ninhomogeneity. Based on theory for 2D crystals [19] we\nexpect the LDOS averaged over the unit cell to decrease\nexponentially with depth z in the crystal at frequencies\nin the band gap, see Fig. 5. In contrast, outside the gap\nthe LDOS varies only slightly with z from vacuum to the\nfinite bulk value (cf. Fig. 1(c)). In the gap, the LDOS\nis minimal at the crystal center with a minimum determined by the crystal size L [20]. Hence we estimate the\nmaximum inhibition at the center of our crystals to be\nmore than 100\u00d7, see Fig. 5.\nSpatial inhomogeneity has intriguing consequences:\nexperimentally we measure time-resolved emission that is\nproportional to the radiative rate \u03b3rad times the LDOSdistribution [16]. Thus such an experiment is biased to\nquantum dots with a high emission rate and against dots\nwith a strong inhibition. This qualitatively explains why\nwe observe a finite inhibition. To take advantage of the\nstrong inhibition deep inside 3D crystals calls for completely different experimental approaches, viz., the probing of excited-state populations to directly verify the theoretical predictions [5\u20139]. We propose to use transient\nabsorption as a probe of excited states that become more\nand more stable due to the shielding of the vacuum fluctuations in a 3D photonic band gap.\nIn addition to spatial inhomogeneity, non-zero non-\n\nradiative decay occurs for any real light source. Hence, a\ntime-resolved emission experiment yields a total rate that\nequals the sum of the radiative and non-radiative rates:\n\u03b3tot = \u03b3rad + \u03b3nrad . When \u03b3rad is strongly inhibited in a\n3D photonic band gap, as is the case here, the rate \u03b3tot is\nminimal with a lower bound given by \u03b3nrad . While \u03b3nrad\nis not well known for our quantum dots, we can estimate\nan upper bound from the maximum observed inhibition\nto be 1/12 \u00d7 1.9 = 0.16\u03bcs\u22121 , which is reasonable in view\nof data on other colloidal dots [21].\nFinally, it is well-known that the emission rate strongly\ndepends on orientation [22]. Since our quantum dots are\nin suspension they sample all orientations of the transition dipole moment. Thus the inhibition observed here\nis robust to orientation averaging. This is in contrast\nto recently observed inhibited emission in 2D photonic\ncrystals [23], and nanowires [24] that concern dots with\na particular orientation of the transition dipole moment.\nWe thank L\u00e9on Woldering, Hannie van den Broek, and\nWillem Tjerkstra for expert sample preparation.
