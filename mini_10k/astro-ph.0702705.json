Such magnifications can attain typical values\nof 1 to 3 magnitudes in concentrated cluster cores, enabling the detection of intrinsically fainter sources than\nin unlensed field surveys. The detailed study of low luminosity galaxies at z > 2, where the major fraction\nof star-formation activity is thought to occur, is an interesting but poorly-understood topic. Such galaxies\ncan either be found through their Lyman-\u03b1 emission (e.g., Franx et al. 1997; Santos et al. 2004), or through\ntheir ultraviolet continuum fluxes via the Lyman break techniques (Kneib et al. 2004; Richard et al. 2006).\nA prerequisite for strong lensing studies of intrinsically faint galaxies at high redshift is an accurate\nmeasurement of the projected mass distribution in the lens (Kneib et al. 2003; Gavazzi et al. 2003; Sand et al.\n2005). Such mass models are primarily limited by the number of available multiply-imaged sources of\nknown redshift. Only a few well-studied clusters like Abell 1689 (Broadhurst et al. 2005; Halkola et al.\n2006; Limousin et al. 2007), with more than 30 multiply-imaged systems, or Abell 2218 (Ebbels et al. 1996;\nKneib et al. 1996) have sufficient constraints to permit precise modelling of each individual dark matter\nclump.\nSpectroscopic searches for Lyman-\u03b1 emitters (LAEs) at high redshift usually have a better line flux\nsensitivity and span a larger redshift range (\u2206z \u223c 4) than those of wide-field narrow-band surveys. This\ngain in sensitivity is even larger in strong lensing applications. Lensed spectroscopic surveys may also be\nsensitive to sources with emission lines with an equivalent width W < 20 \u00c5 , smaller than those in narrowband surveys (e.g., Fynbo et al. 2003; Shimasaku et al. 2006). An additional complication in narrow-band\nsurveys is how interlopers are treated; confirmatory spectroscopy is usually necessary. By contrast, in lensed\nsurveys, the geometrical configuration of multiply-imaged systems can reliably distinguish between high\nredshift objects and low redshift interlopers (see e.g., Ellis et al. 2001).\nAs our surveys expand, a variety of types of emission line galaxies are being discovered. Of particular\ninterest are the extended Lyman-\u03b1 emission sources which have been mainly discovered in regions of significant overdensity through deep narrow-band imaging (Steidel et al. 2000; Francis et al. 2001). Matsuda et al.\n(2004) have identified a large number of such giant Lyman-\u03b1 blobs (with a typical size > 50 kpc) in a 34'\u00d7 27'\nfield of view, demonstrating the existence of a continuous distribution. The origin of the extended Lyman-\u03b1\nemission in such radio-quiet sources may be explained by gas inflow during the early stages of galaxy formation: large amounts of hydrogen collapsing into the dark matter potential well will cool through Lyman-\u03b1\nradiation. Giant Lyman-\u03b1 blobs may thus be the progenitors of very massive galaxies in the local Universe.\nA key issue is whether the same process is seen to occur in lower-mass objects. A route to addressing\nthis question is to examine the nature of smaller extended Lyman-\u03b1 sources, either by long-slit or Integral\nField Spectroscopy (IFS). This identification is more easily accomplished in strongly-lensed sources where\nmagnification will stretch the observed physical scales.\nThe spatial magnification associated with lensing can also be used to yield physical sizes for the most\ndistant sources. Using strong lensing in the cluster Abell 2218, Ellis et al. (2001) located a remarkably small\nsource at z=5.6 where the combination of the Ly\u03b1 emission line flux density and the weak stellar continuum\nwere used to deduce a young age and modest stellar mass (\u2243 106\u22127 M\u2299 ) consistent, perhaps, with a forming\nglobular cluster. Further surveys are required to evaluate whether such systems are common at z \u22436.\nThe major drawback arising from the study of lensed sources located through studies of individual\nclusters is, of course, the significant cosmic variance that is associated with the small volumes being probed.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nCompared to field surveys, any statistical inferences on the abundances of various classes of populations\nmay be much more uncertain, even granting fainter sources are probed. To overcome this limitation, an\neffective survey would have to be conducted through a large sample (\u224320-40) of lensing clusters, each with\nreliable mass models based on the spectroscopic study of many multiply-imaged systems (Kneib et al. 1996).\nFortunately, the construction of such a sample of well-mapped clusters is now a realistic proposition. Several\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) snapshot imaging surveys of X-ray luminous clusters are now underway with\nassociated ground-based spectroscopy, such as the MAssive Clusters Survey (MACS, GO#10491, P.I.: H.\nEbeling) and the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS, GO#10881, P.I.: G. Smith).\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate the promise of such surveys by examining spectroscopically the\nrich population of lensed sources located in the lensing cluster Abell 68 (\u03b1=00:37:06.81 \u03b4=+09:09:24.0 J2000,\nz = 0.255), one of the most X-ray luminous clusters (LX \u223c 8.4 \u00b1 2.3 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 , 0.1\u20132.4 keV) in the X-ray\nBrightest Abell-type Clusters sample (XBACS, Ebeling et al. (1996)). Strong lensing in this cluster has been\npreviously studied by Smith et al. (2005), hereafter S05, as part of a survey of 10 X-ray luminous galaxy\nclusters at z \u223c 0.2. Smith et al identified a list of potential multiple-image systems, a few of which were\nconfirmed spectroscopically. Here we significantly extend this work by securing the redshifts of new multipleimage systems, many of which are strongly-lensed Lyman-\u03b1 emitters at z & 2. The combination of a large\nmagnification factor, high-resolution HST imaging and broad-band photometry enables us to demonstrate\nthe value of studying the physical properties of these faint emitters, such as their star formation rates,\nintrinsic scales and stellar masses. The paper is intended to illustrate the significant promise of continuing\nsuch spectroscopic work with the larger samples of clusters now being surveyed with HST.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the various observations and the reduction\nof the spectroscopic data. We present in Section 3 the strong-lensing constraints, in the light of the redshifts\nand identification of new multiply-imaged systems. Section 4 presents a mass model of the cluster from\nwhich the source magnifications are deduced. The physical properties of the various categories of high\nredshift LAEs are presented in Section 5 and the implications are discussed in the context of the limitations\nof blank field surveys in Section 6. We summarize our conclusions in Section 7.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the following cosmology: a flat \u039b-dominated Universe with the values\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9b = 0.045 and H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . All magnitudes given in the paper are quoted\nin the AB system (Oke 1974). The correction values CAB between AB and Vega photometric systems,\ndefined as mAB = mVega + CAB , are reported in Table 1 for each filter. At the redshift z = 0.255 of the\ncluster, the angular diameter distance is 3.9 kpc arcsec\u22121.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nWe present in this section the photometric and spectroscopic datasets used to assemble our catalog.\nHigh resolution images are crucial for the morphological identification of multiple image systems and the\nprecise astrometric position of the sources studied here, whereas multicolor images are used to estimate their\nspectral energy distributions. Redshift and emission lines measurements for individual objects were obtained\nduring subsequent spectroscopic observations. These included multi-object spectroscopy of multiply-imaged\ncandidates, as well as systematic long-slit searches in the central regions of the cluster. Figure 1 shows the\nlocation of the main spectroscopic settings in the cluster field.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\n2.1.\n\nImaging data\n\nA considerable body of multi-wavelength data exists in the field around Abell 68, including high resolution HST imaging. The main characteristics of the dataset used in this study are summarized in Table 1.\n3 \u00d7 2.5 ks of integration time with the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC2) was obtained during Cycle\n8 in the R-F702W band, as part of HST program #8249 (PI : J.P. Kneib). Observations were carried out\nin low sky mode, and a 1.0\u2032\u2032 dithering pattern was used between each exposure. Details on the reduction of\nthese data are given in S05.\nRecognition of faint multiply-imaged systems in the vicinity of the cluster core is hindered by the dominant stellar halo of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). To overcome this, we fitted and subtracted from\nthe HST image a model representation of the surface brightness distribution using the IRAF task ellipse.\nBoth the position angle and ellipticity were allowed to vary as a function of the semimajor axis in the fitted\nelliptical isophotes, as well as the isophote centroid in the central part. This procedure was found to give\nsatisfactory residuals at the center (Figure 3).\nAssociated optical images in B, R, I have been obtained on UT 1999 November 19 using the CFH12k\ncamera at CFHT. These sample a field of 42'\u00d728' at a 0.205\u2032\u2032 pixel scale. The total exposure times are 8.1,\n7.2 and 3.6 ks in the B, R and I band, respectively. The data was reduced using procedures similar to those\ndescribed by Czoske (2002) and Bardeau et al. (2005).\nAt longer wavelengths, Abell 68 has been observed at the Very Large Telescope using the FOcal Reducer\n/ low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2/UT4) in the z-band on UT 2002 October 06, and the Infrared\nSpectrometer And Array Camera (ISAAC/UT1) in the J and H bands on UT 2002 September 29 . The\nfield of view of the FORS2 image is 7.2 \u00d7 7.2 arcmins after dithering, with a pixel size of 0.252\u2032\u2032, and we\nused 80 dithered exposures of 120 s. The field of view of the ISAAC images is about 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 arcmins after\ndithering, with a pixel size of 0.148\u2032\u2032, the subintegration \u00d7 integration times of the dithered exposures were 6\n\u00d7 35 s and 10 \u00d7 12 s in the J and H bands, respectively. All these data have been reduced using procedures\nsimilar to those described by Richard et al. (2006).\nInstrument\nCFH12k\nCFH12k\nWFPC2\nCFH12k\nFORS2\nISAAC\nISAAC\n\nFilter\nB\nR\nR702W\nI\nz\nJ\nH\n\nExposure Time\n(ks)\n8.1\n7.2\n7.5\n3.6\n9.6\n6.48\n7.12\n\nPixel Size\n\u2032\u2032\n\n0.206\n0.206\n0.1\n0.206\n0.252\n0.148\n0.148\n\nDepth\nAB mag.\n27.4\n27.2\n28.0\n26.5\n26.5\n26.2\n26.3\n\nCAB\nmag.\n-0.066\n0.246\n0.299\n0.462\n0.554\n0.945\n1.412\n\nSeeing\n\u2032\u2032\n\n1.11\n0.67\n0.17\n0.58\n0.71\n0.48\n0.48\n\nTable 1: Properties of the photometric dataset: from left to right: instrument and filter names, total integration time, pixel size, photometric depth (defined as 4 pixels above 3 \u03c3, where \u03c3 stands for the typical local\nbackground noise), photometric correction CAB between AB and Vega systems, seeing measured on bright\nunsaturated stars.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Composite CFH12k-BRI color image of the field of view around the center of Abell 68.

We delineate the imprints of\nthe HST/WFPC2 (black polygon) and the VIMOS/IFU (blue square) fields, as well as the spatial coverage\nof the different LRIS long-slit configurations (red rectangles).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\n2.2.\n\nKeck Multi-Object Spectroscopy\n\nThe Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS; Oke et al. (1995)) on Keck I has been used in multiobject (MOS) mode during two observing runs, in order to target background galaxies and multiply-imaged\ncandidates selected on the basis of morphology and colors.\nOn UT 2001 August 4, 4 exposures of 1.8 ks were acquired with a 31 slits-mask, using a 300 l mm\u22121\ngrism blazed at 5000 \u00c5 in the single red channel of the camera, which covers the approximate range 55009900 \u00c5 at the dispersion of 2.5 \u00c5 per pixel. The average seeing was \u223c 1.0\u2032\u2032 . The night was photometric and\nspectrophotometric standard stars were used for flux calibration.\nOn UT 2002 November 30, a 32 slits-mask was used during 3 \u00d7 2.4 ks of integration time. A 6800 \u00c5\ndichroic separated the red channel of the instrument, equipped with a 600 l mm\u22121 grating blazed at 7500\n\u00c5, from the blue channel equipped with a 400 l mm\u22121 blazed at 3400 \u00c5. The whole setting covers the\nwavelength range 3500-9500 \u00c5 with dispersions of 1.28 and 1.09 \u00c5 per pixel in the red and blue channels,\nrespectively. Despite good seeing conditions (\u223c 0.8\u2032\u2032 ), the night was not photometric and no standard stars\nwere observed.\nThese datasets were reduced using standard IRAF procedures for bias removal, flat-fielding, wavelength\nand flux calibration, sky subtraction and extraction of the one-dimensional spectra.\n\n2.3.\n\nKeck long-slit spectroscopy\n2.3.1.\n\nOptical spectroscopy\n\nAbell 68 was observed on UT 2002 September 11 with LRIS, in the course of a survey targeting lowluminosity Lyman-\u03b1 sources at high redshift (Santos et al. 2004). A 175\u2032\u2032 -long and 1\u2032\u2032 -wide slit was used to\nmap the high magnification regions of a sample of z \u223c 0.2 lensing clusters. In the case of Abell 68, 6 adjacent\nslit settings scanned the theoretical location of the critical lines at z \u223c 5, with 2\u00d71000 s of integration time\nat each position. The reduction of these data is detailed in (Santos et al. 2004).\nIn addition to the detection of high redshift sources through their Lyman-\u03b1 emission, this blind spectroscopic survey provided secure redshifts for a number of lensed background galaxies serendipitously falling\ninto the long slit.\nOn UT 2003 August 26, a single long-slit LRIS position was aligned on two components of a triplyimaged system, discovered as R-dropouts by a RIz color-color selection technique (see Sect. 3). A 300 l\nmm\u22121 grism blazed at 5000 \u00c5 and a 600 l mm\u22121 grating blazed at 1\u03bcm were used in the blue and red\nchannels of the instrument, both lightpaths being separated by a dichroic at 6800 \u00c5. Two exposures of 1.2\nks were acquired at this position, with a 5\u2032\u2032 dithering offset along the slit.\nFinally, an additional LRIS long-slit integration of 3 \u00d7 1.2 ks was acquired on UT 2005 November 29\nwith a 600 l mm\u22121 grism blazed at 4000 \u00c5, a 400 l mm\u22121 grating blazed at 8500 \u00c5, a 5600 \u00c5 dichroic, and\n5\u2032\u2032 dithering offsets.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\n2.3.2.\n\nNear Infrared Spectroscopy\n\nAbell 68 was observed on UT 2005 October 13 using the Near InfraRed SPECtrograph (NIRSPEC,\nMcLean et al. (1998)) on Keck II, during a spectroscopic survey of the critical lines of lensing clusters\nsimilar to the LRIS survey described before, but at longer wavelengths (Stark & Ellis 2006). A 42\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.76\u2032\u2032\nlong slit was used at 2 adjacent slit positions, with 9 \u00d7 600 s of integration time on each of them. The\nspectra were reduced using IDL routines, following optimal spectroscopic reductions techniques presented in\nKelson (2003). More details are presented in a forthcoming paper (Stark et al. 2006b, in press).\n\n2.4.\n\nVLT - Integral Field Spectroscopy\n\nAbell 68 was observed on UT 2004 August 12 using the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS,\nLe F\u00e8vre et al. (2003)) on VLT/UT3 in low-resolution (LR-Blue grism) Intregral Field Spectroscopy mode, as\npart of a survey targeting the central regions of an intermediate-redshift galaxy cluster sample (073.A-0774,\nPI: Soucail). The 54\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 54\u2032\u2032 field of view of the Integral Field Unit (IFU, composed of 6400 fibers, splitted\nin 4 quadrants feeding the 4 VIMOS CCDs) was centered on the cD galaxy. In the given configuration,\nthe spectral resolution is about 200 and the diameter of the fibers is 0.66\u2032\u2032 , covering the wavelength range\n3900-6800 \u00c5 with a dispersion of 5.355 \u00c5 per pixel. 2 \u00d7 2.4 ks of integration time have been acquired without\ndithering.\nThese 3D spectroscopic data have been reduced using the Vimos Interactive Pipeline Graphical Interface\n(VIPGI, Scodeggio et al. 2005)1 . Before building the data cube for each exposure, every step in the data\nreduction was performed on a single quadrant basis. After bias subtraction and cosmic ray removal (see\nZanichelli et al. (2005) for a description of the algorithm), the spectra were traced on the CCDs with the\nhelp of the high S/N spectra of a continuum lamp. Following wavelength calibration, inhomogeneities in\nfiber efficiencies were corrected by measuring the counts in the 5577 \u00c5 sky emission line after subtracting the\ncontribution from a galaxy spectrum where fibers cover a galaxy position. The flux-calibration is applied by\nusing observations of a standard star in each quadrant. See Covone et al. (2006), who present similar data\non Abell 2667, for a detailed description of the procedures.\n\n2.5.\n\nRedshift measurements\n\nWe attempted to measure the redshift of all individual objects falling in the slits that revealed a discernable continuum or possible emission lines. To obtain an accurate redshift measurement for foreground\ngalaxies, cluster members and other bright objects, we applied the IRAF task xcsao from the Radial Velocity\npackage RVSAO (Kurtz et al. 1992) on all extracted spectra. This procedure uses a cross-correlation method\nbased on spectral templates (Coleman et al. 1980; Kinney et al. 1996) to estimate the redshift and the corresponding redshift error. For the remaining objects in the spectroscopic catalog, the redshift measurement is\nbased on the wavelength at the peak of the brightest emission line detected. In the latter case, we estimated\nthe redshift error from the spectral dispersion. Additional uncertainties generated by the accuracy of the\nrelative and absolute wavelength calibrations, of about 0.8 and 1.5 \u00c5 respectively for the LRIS data, were\n1 VIPGI\nhas\nbeen\ndeveloped\nwithin\nhttp://cosmos.mi.iasf.cnr.it/pandora/vipgi.html\n\nthe\n\nVIRMOS\n\nConsortium.\n\nFor\n\nmore\n\ninformation,\n\nsee\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nID\n\nRA\n00:\n\nDec\n09:\n\nR\n[mag]\n\nz\n\nC\n\nFeatures\n\n\u03bc\n[mag]\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n(C15a)\n(C15b)\n(C26)\n(C23a)\n(C25)\n(C20c)\n(C4)\n(C27)\n\n37:04.297\n37:04.861\n37:08.960\n37:07.902\n37:06.506\n37:05.405\n37:07.657\n37:04.906\n\n09:43.40\n09:51.78\n09:06.90\n09:29.80\n10:16.70\n09:59.14\n09:05.90\n10:30.20\n\n26.00 \u00b1 0.18\n26.52 \u00b1 0.22\n27.24 \u00b1 0.25\n26.44 \u00b1 0.18\n24.40 \u00b1 0.07\n25.15 \u00b1 0.09\n23.31 \u00b1 0.04\n22.81 \u00b1 0.03\n\n5.421 \u00b1 0.0021\n5.421 \u00b1 0.0021\n3.677 \u00b1 0.0022\n3.135 \u00b1 0.0021\n2.6930 \u00b1 0.0021\n2.6890 \u00b1 0.0020\n2.6280 \u00b1 0.0021\n1.7546 \u00b1 0.0021\n\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n4\n\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\nLy\u03b1\n\n2.74\u00b10.08\n2.89\u00b10.07\n2.06\u00b10.03\n2.47\u00b10.07\n1.12\u00b10.07\n3.61\u00b10.09\n4.15\u00b10.16\n1.72\u00b10.10\n\n9 (C1a)\n10 (C12)\n11 (C7)\n12 (C8)\n13 (C24)\n14\n15\n16\n17 (C14)\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\n37:06.207\n37:04.930\n37:05.073\n37:03.700\n37:05.900\n37:04.352\n37:08.541\n37:07.100\n37:08.534\n37:02.707\n37:05.505\n37:01.890\n37:05.000\n37:01.400\n37:08.620\n37:06.410\n37:05.670\n36:57.170\n\n09:17.49\n10:21.40\n10:04.90\n09:54.10\n09:59.70\n07:39.60\n08:01.30\n08:23.10\n09:14.10\n08:19.18\n09:24.24\n07:27.70\n07:50.60\n05:55.20\n08:51.40\n09:50.65\n10:04.90\n07:00.80\n\n24.02 \u00b1 0.04\n21.67 \u00b1 0.02\n22.78 \u00b1 0.03\n23.08 \u00b1 0.02\n23.64 \u00b1 0.02\n21 .91 \u00b1 0 .03\n22 .49 \u00b1 0 .03\n21 .44 \u00b1 0 .02\n22.02 \u00b1 0.02\n20 .52 \u00b1 0 .02\n22.71 \u00b1 0.02\n21 .40 \u00b1 0 .03\n20 .33 \u00b1 0 .02\n22 .10 \u00b1 0 .02\n23.29 \u00b1 0.04\n24.66 \u00b1 0.05\n24.00 \u00b1 0.04\n21 .03 \u00b1 0 .01\n\n1.5836 \u00b1 0.0011\n1.0171 \u00b1 0.0011\n0.8610 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.8609 \u00b1 0.0008\n0.8152 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.6386 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.6281 \u00b1 0.0006\n0.6275 \u00b1 0.0006\n0.6234 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.6225 \u00b1 0.0006\n0.6224 \u00b1 0.0006\n0.6195 \u00b1 0.0005\n0.6177 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.5944 \u00b1 0.0005\n0.5817 \u00b1 0.0006\n0.4941 \u00b1 0.0006\n0.3958 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.3693 \u00b1 0.0005\n\n4\n3\n3\n4\n1\n3\n3\n3\n2\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n[OIII ], H\u03b2\n[OII ], H\u03b1\n[OII ]\n[OII ]\nK, H, H\u03b3\n[OII ]\nK, H\nK, H\nK, H\nK, H\n[OII ], [OIII ]\nM gII , [OIII ]\n[OII ]\nH\u03b2, [OIII ]\nH\u03b2, [OIII ]\nH\u03b2, [OIII ]\nH\u03b1, [OIII ], [OII ]\n[OII ], [OIII ]\n\n2.52\u00b10.06\n1.63\u00b10.06\n1.59\u00b10.02\n1.37\u00b10.03\n1.33\u00b10.01\n0.10\n0.20\n0.28\n0.93\u00b10.01\n0.20\n1.83\n0.10\n0.10\n0.0\n0.51\n0.75\n0.51\n0.0\n\nW0\n[\u00c5]\n(Ly\u03b1)\n53 \u00b1 16a\n107 \u00b1 8.2\n25.9 \u00b1 5.2\n10.4 \u00b1 5.1\n30.4 \u00b1 6.3\n42.4 \u00b1 2.3\n2.4 \u00b1 0.5\n([OII ])\n< 50\n10.5 \u00b1 1.4\n21.3 \u00b1 5.9\n112.8 \u00b1 5.1\nN/A\n14.1 \u00b1 4.5\n< 10\n14.6 \u00b1 2.2\n16.5 \u00b1 7.4\n6.7 \u00b1 1.3\n25.3 \u00b1 6.5\nN/A\n10.7 \u00b1 1.7\nN/A\n< 10\n< 10\n24.5 \u00b1 2.2\n10.2 \u00b1 2.1\n\nTable 2: Spectroscopic catalog of lensed background galaxies.

(1995): this corresponds to a probability level for a correct identification\nof 50, 75, 95 and 100%, respectively. A specific value of 9 is used when only a single secure spectral feature\nis seen in emission. The identification of most z > 2 objects in the catalog is based on only a single emission\nline interpreted as Lyman-\u03b1 and a confidence class of 9. However, the constraints provided by the lensing\nconfiguration in case of multiple images (see Sect. 3) enable us to strengthen most of these interpretations.\nMulticolor photometry was performed for all sources identified in the WFPC/F702W band and CFH12kR band images, using the SExtractor software (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). Total magnitudes and errors were\nmeasured on the original images without any resampling or convolution.\nThe final spectroscopic catalog of lensed galaxies is presented in Table 2.\nFigure 1 displays the location of all sources in the catalog and the spectroscopic configuration of each\ndataset. A red circle marks the location of 44 cluster members from our sample, for which we measured a\nspectroscopic redshift. Long-slit and IFU pointings were mainly focused on the central region of the cluster\n(within \u223c80\u2032\u2032 ), in the vicinity of the critical curves, whereas MOS surveys with LRIS probed a wider field\nof view of \u223c 6 \u00d7 8 arcmin.\nThe redshift distribution of lensed background galaxies appears to be highly correlated. Three sources\nare located in the 2.63 < z < 2.69 range, two sources have z \u223c 0.86, and C1 system has a z \u223c 1.6 redshift\nsimilar to C0 Smith et al. (2002b). Even more prominent is a group of 8 sources having 0.62 < z < 0.64,\nwhich lie predominantly at the south of the cluster center, and exhibit similar colors in the composite CFH12k\nimage (Figure 1).\n\n3.\n\nCatalog of Multiply-Imaged Systems\n\nIn this section we update the catalog of multiply-imaged systems in the field of Abell 68, taking into\naccount both our new spectroscopic measures and systems without spectroscopy located on the basis of\ntheir geometrical location and similar colors. For each system, we present a close-up view from the HST-R\nimage in the bottom panels of Figure 3, and summarize the position, photometry, shape parameters and\nmagnification in Table 3.\n\n3.1.\n\nMorphological Identification\n\nMultiply-imaged systems can be identified via a visual inspection of morphologies in the central region\nof the HST-R702W image (Fig. 3) , examined in combination with the broad-band photometric catalogs.\nOur starting point is a detailed study of candidates identified to \u03bc702 \u223c 25 mag arcsec\u22122 presented by S05.\nThis work revealed 3 main systems (C0a,b,c; C1a,b,c; C2a,b) as well as 20 other possible multiply-imaged\ncandidates (C3 to C22). We adopt the same nomenclature, extending to include the new systems presented\nhere.\nThe three images identified as C15, C16 and C17 have been selected as R-band dropouts on the basis\nof color-color diagrams combining R, I and z-band filters. Indeed, they are very faint in the HST image\n(R702 \u223c 25.7), undetected at shorter wavelengths in the B or R band with CFH12k with a combination\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nSystem\n\nRA\nDEC\na\n\u2032\u2032\n00:\n09:\nC0 a 37:07.426\n09:28.42\n0.66\nb 37:07.324\n09:24.03\n0.63\nc 37:06.161\n09:08.84\n0.42\nradial 37:06.870\n09:25.51\n0.61\nC1 a 37:06.190\n09:17.42\n1.38\nb 37:06.466\n09:24.80\n1.14\nc 37:07.515\n09:39.42\n0.84\nC2 a 37:07.024\n09:33.73\n0.75\nb 37:06.724\n09:31.05\n0.60\n[c] [37:05.822] [09:12.94]\nC15 a 37:04.294\n09:43.41\n0.42\nb 37:04.861\n09:51.79\n0.27\nc 37:05.691\n10:00.41\n0.39\nC20 a 37:04.560\n09:49.94\n0.81\nb 37:04.707\n09:51.85\n0.96\nc 37:05.231\n09:57.58\n0.59\nC23 a 37:07.894\n09:29.88\n0.36\nb 37:07.618\n09:19.99\n0.42\n[c] [37:06.634] [09:05.43]\nPossible multiple-image system\nC10 a 37:03.672\n10:16.75\n1.0\nb 37:03.458\n10:15.85\n1.4\n[c] [37:04.290] [10:23.14]\nMaximum redshift of single images\nC3 37:08.203\n09:22.70\n1.9\nC5 37:06.404\n09:48.42\n1.1\nC9 37:04.235\n10:01.67\n1.7\nC11 37:04.789\n10:03.60\n1.2\nC13 37:04.498\n10:28.08\n2.6\nC18 37:07.945\n09:31.83\n1.2\n\nb\n0.33\n0.36\n0.30\n0.19\n0.48\n0.63\n0.48\n0.39\n0.24\n\n\u03b8\n[deg.]\n24.1\n8.1\n82.3\n350.0\n42.7\n10.1\n41.1\n67.1\n38.6\n\n0.21\n0.21\n0.24\n0.30\n0.30\n0.28\n0.27\n0.21\n\n37.3\n39.6\n41.6\n44.6\n49.2\n59.2\n39.0\n33.7\n\n0.25\n0.18\n\n55.0\n107.0\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.6\n0.4\n0.4\n\n108\n154\n146\n152\n115\n114\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nR\n[mag]\n25.72\u00b10.10\n25.20\u00b10.08\n25.84\u00b10.10\n26.51\u00b10.30\n24.02\u00b10.04\n24.19\u00b10.05\n24.94\u00b10.07\n25.59\u00b10.15\n25.57\u00b10.16\n[26.4]\n26.00\u00b10.18\n26.52\u00b10.22\n26.07\u00b10.17\n25.46\u00b10.11\n24.83\u00b10.06\n26.32\u00b10.16\n26.44\u00b10.18\n26.80\u00b10.23\n[27.4]\n24.56\u00b10.08\n25.27\u00b10.13\n\nz\n1.6a\n\n1.583\n\n[1.39 \u00b1 0.08]\n\n5.421\n5.421\n\n2.689\n3.135\n\n[1.11\u00b10.12]\n\n\u03bc\n[mag]\n3.14\u00b10.06\n2.72\u00b10.06\n2.15\u00b10.11\n1.75\u00b10.12\n2.52\u00b10.06\n2.29\u00b10.06\n1.62\u00b10.04\n3.09\u00b10.06\n2.80\u00b10.05\n1.83\u00b10.08\n2.74\u00b10.08\n2.89\u00b10.07\n2.69\u00b10.10\n4.9\u00b10.3\n5.5\u00b10.7\n3.61\u00b10.09\n2.37\u00b10.07\n2.57\u00b10.06\n1.73\u00b10.05\n3.5\u00b10.6\n3.7\u00b12.0\n\n[< 2.7]\n[< 2.7]\n[< 2.3]\n[< 1.9]\n[< 1.5]\nNo Constraints\n\nTable 3: Properties of the multiple-image systems.

(2002b)\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- (Top) Enlarged region of the R-F702W image showing the location and morphology of the multipleimage systems identified in the field of Abell 68. We subtracted the contribution from the brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) to assist in the identification of underlying objects, such as the radial arc associated with C0.\nThe thin/thick black curves show the location of the critical lines at z = 1.6 and z = 5.42 respectively, as\ninferred from the mass model (\u00a74). We overplot in red new spectroscopic redshifts of background sources.\n(Bottom) Close-up on each component of the multiple systems discussed in the text.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nof red (R \u2212 I)AB \u223c 1.7 and blue (I \u2212 z)AB \u223c \u22120.5 colors, as measured with aperture photometry on\nthe seeing-matched images. Such a spectral energy distribution (SED) is characteristic of galaxies in the\nredshift range 5 . z . 6, where the Lyman-\u03b1 break in the spectral continuum occurs between the R and I\nbands. The preliminary mass model (\u00a74) shows that the location of these three images is compatible with a\nmultiply-imaged source, thereby strengthening the high redshift interpretation. We designate this system by\nC15 (with three images C15a,b,c that correspond to C15/16/17) and confirmed the components C15a and\nC15b lie at the same redshift using LRIS spectroscopy (see Section 3.2).\nThe arclet identified as C20 was serendipitously covered during the same LRIS long-slit observation.\nWe interpret the extended emission seen in the spectrum (Sect. 3.2) as Lyman-\u03b1 at z = 2.689. This is also\nsupported by the mass model, which predicts 2 detected counter-images with similar optical colors. We refer\nto this system as C20a,b,c.\nNext to C20a and C20b images, a fainter extended arc C6 was identified by S05 as a possible multiplyimaged system at a similar redshift. This arc can be split into 3 components C6a,b,c.\nFinally, we uncovered a new lensed image, C23a, close to the cluster center during the critical line\nsurvey using LRIS (Santos et al. 2004). Its spectrum is consistent with a high redshift source dominated by\nits Lyman-\u03b1 emission. Again, the cluster mass model predicts the position of a second faint component for\nthis system (C23b), detected on the HST image.\n\n3.2.\n\nRedshift Constraints\n\nWe now present the new spectroscopic redshifts obtained for 6 multiply-imaged candidates, as well as\nconstraints implied for the remaining multiply-imaged systems C2 and C10, from the updated mass model\n(Sect. 4).\n\u2022 C0 source\nThis source is a strongly-lensed (\u03bc \u223c 3.2 mag.) multiply-imaged system with three components,\ndiscovered during a survey for Extremely Red Objects (EROs) in the fields of 10 massive galaxy\ncluster lenses at z \u223c 0.2 (Smith et al. 2002a). A redshift measurement on the brightest image, C0a,\nwas presented in Smith et al. (2002b). Based on the 4000 \u00c5-break identification at \u03bb = 1.04 \u00b1 0.01\u03bcm,\nthe redshift is z = 1.60 \u00b1 0.03. This image was also included in two LRIS masks, but we failed to\ndetect strong spectral features in the wavelength range 5500-9200 \u00c5 .\nBecause of the clear symmetry of images C0a and C0b with respect to the critical line, it is possible to\nisolate 4 bright knots in each image a, b and c and use the corresponding 12 images to constrain the\nmass model. Furthermore, part of the south-west knot of C0a is located within the radial caustic line\nin the source plane. We are able to detect a very faint radial arc predicted by the mass model (labeled\nC0-radial on Fig. 3) after removing the light from the BCG.\n\u2022 C1 source\nThe brightest component C1a of this system was observed during our NIRSPEC critical lines survey\n(see Stark & Ellis (2006) and Stark et al. (2006b), in press). Three strong emission lines were identified\nas [OIII]5007, [OIII]4959 and H\u03b2 (Figure 4, left), which unambiguously give a redshift z = 1.583.\nOptical spectroscopy of component C1c, included in one of our LRIS masks, could not identify any\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nstrong [OII ] emission for this source, with a 3 \u03c3 upper limit of 50 \u00c5 for the equivalent width in restframe.\n\u2022 C4 source\nAlthough not multiply-imaged, this blue arc has very strong Lyman-\u03b1 emission corresponding to z \u223c\n2.63. An extended Lyman-\u03b1 blob has also been detected in the IFU data (see Sect. 5.4 and Figure\n3). The mass model gives a very high magnification factor of \u03bc \u223c 4.0 mag., because the source is very\nclose to a cusp.\n\u2022 C6 and C20 sources\nWe identify a spatially-extended emission line in the LRIS spectrum at \u03bb = 4485 \u00c5 , surrounding\nthe C20c image (Fig. 4, middle). The lack of other strong emission lines in the optical range and\nthe predicted position for two other components for C20 from the mass model confirms this to be\nLyman-\u03b1 at z = 2.689. In addition, this redshift is close to the Lyman-\u03b1 blob associated with C4, and\nwe identify a similar strong emission line at a similar redshift, z = 2.693, for the nearby source C25\n(\u223c 8\u2032\u2032 away in the source plane).\nThe location and color of the lower surface brightness arc, C6, close to images C20a and C20b, is\ncompatible with three merging images forming a single giant arc at a similar redshift (Fig. 4, middle).\nThis is further evidence of a possible group of galaxies at z \u223c 2.6 including sources C6, C20 and C25.\n\u2022 C15 source\nA strong asymmetric emission line is clearly seen on the LRIS spectrum at the position of C15a and\nC15b (Figure 4, top-right), with a central peak at 7808 \u00c5. In both cases, a faint continuum is detected\non the red side of the emission line, with a flux \u223c 4.4 \u00b1 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221219 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 . We interpret\nthe emission line as Lyman-\u03b1 at z = 5.421. This redshift could be slightly overestimated due to an\nunknown amount of self-absorption in the Lyman-\u03b1 emission line and the absence of other spectral\nfeatures. By averaging the extracted spectra of both images (Figure 4, top-right), the integrated flux\nmeasured within the emission line, of 9.7 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10\u221217 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 , corresponds to a rest-frame\nequivalent width of \u223c 35 \u00c5. We measure a Full-Width Half-Maximum of \u223c 7 \u00c5 when fitting the\naverage emission line with a gaussian profile. The strong Lyman-\u03b1 emission line of this source seems\nto dominate the overall I-band flux.\n\u2022 C23 source\nThe identification of the pair of images C23a and C23b, predicted by the lensing model at z = 3.1,\nstrengthens the Lyman-\u03b1 interpretation for the single emission line seen in the spectrum of C23a at\n\u03bb = 5028 \u00c5. A fainter counterimage, C23c, predicted by the mass model, lies beyond the detection\nlimit of the HST image.\n\u2022 C2 source\nThis system is composed of two bright symmetrical images, identified close to the cluster center. Using\nthe mass model, we predict a redshift of z \u223c 1.4 for this source, with a magnification factor of \u03bc \u223c 2.9\nmag. for C2a and C2b. A less magnified (\u03bc \u223c 1.8 mag.) counter-image C2c is also predicted by the\nmodel, but is not detected in the less-sensitive region of the HST image, at the junction between 2 WF\nchips.\n\u2022 C10 source\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- (Left) NIRSPEC bidimensional spectrum of component C1a, showing the detection of 3 strong\nfeatures identified as [OIII ] and H\u03b2 emission lines at z = 1.583, both in positive (black) or negative (white),\ndue to dithering offsets used. (Middle) Location of the LRIS slit and extended Lyman-\u03b1 emission identified\naround image C20c (thick ellipse). Two brighter components C20a and C20b are predicted by the mass\nmodel, in agreement with the location of the critical line at z = 2.68 (solid curve). The shape and colors of\nthe adjacent giant arc C6 are compatible with a similar redshift, suggesting a physical connection between\nthese two sources. (Right) Upper panel: close-up of the 2-D sky-subtracted LRIS spectrum, showing both\nstrong emission lines seen at the position of C15a and C15b. Lower panel: average extracted spectrum\nof C15, with the same wavelength range, revealing the clear asymmetrical shape of the spectral line. The\nrelative sky background level is presented as a dotted curve.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nA faint curved arc near a bright cluster member was identified by S05 as a multiple imaged candidate\nC10. The optical colors of this blue arc are indeed compatible with a source at z < 2.5. It is probably\nformed by two images merging on the critical line; its shape is in agreement with predictions from the\nmass model. However, the low surface brightness of this arc and the lack of spectroscopic information\nstrongly limit this interpretation, making it more uncertain than the systems previously mentioned.\nTherefore, we only include this source in Table 3 as a possible additional multiple imaged system. The\nmass model predicts a redshift of \u223c 1.1 which is in very good agreement with the photometric redshift\nestimate of zphot = 1.15 \u00b1 0.05 derived from the broad band colors using the Hyperz photometric\nredshift code (Bolzonella et al. 2000). A fainter counter-image (C10c) is predicted by the mass model,\nbut remains undetected in the HST image.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nMass model\nModeling method\n\nUsing the new redshift measurements and the identification of further multiply-imaged systems, we are\nnow in a position to considerably improve the precision of the mass model presented by S05. In doing so,\nwe will maintain the Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical Mass Distribution model (PIEMD, Kassiola & Kovner\n1993) adopted by S05 to infer the dark matter mass distribution. This parametric method has been used\nfor modeling galaxy clusters as well as individual galaxies (Covone et al. 2006; Natarajan et al. 1998). It\nassumes each dark matter clump can be parameterized by a central position, ellipticity a/b, position angle\n\u03b8, central velocity dispersion \u03c30 and two characteristic radii rcore and rcut . The total mass of this profile is\nproportional to rcut \u03c302 . A more detailed discussion of the validity of this approach, in contrast to alternatives,\nis given by Limousin et al. (2007).\nThe cluster galaxy population is incorporated into the lens model as galaxy-scale perturbations to the\ncluster potential, assuming a scaling relation M/L = Const (Brainerd et al. 1996, S05) for all the rcore ,\nrcut and \u03c30 . This is motivated by the similar Faber & Jackson (1976) scaling relation observed in elliptical\n\u2217\nand \u03c30\u2217 values corregalaxies. Following the same procedure as Limousin et al. (2007), we keep the rcut\n\u2217\n\u2217\nsponding to a L elliptical galaxy as free parameters, while keeping rcore at 0.15 kpc. We select cluster\ngalaxies in the field of Abell 68 by plotting the characteristic cluster red sequences (B-R702 ) and (R702 -K)\nin two color-magnitude diagrams, keeping the objects pertaining to both red sequences. This reduces the\nphotometric catalog used by S05, containing 69 galaxies with K band photometry, to 47 cluster members.\nThis method is more efficient than a single red sequence selection as we did not select any of the spectroscopically confirmed background or foreground galaxies. As described in S05, the K-band photometry\nwas obtained by Balogh et al. (2002) using GIM2D (Simard 1998) to fit the surface brightness profiles of\nthe cluster galaxies. This method gives more accurate results than one could obtain with SExtractor, because SExtractor usually overestimate the local background around the brightest and most extended galaxies.\nIn a first attempt at modeling the lens, we adopted the parameters given by S05, who included two dark\nmatter halos. We found any attempt to reconstruct the mass distribution using a single clump was unable\nto reproduce the multiply-imaged systems accurately, confirming the strong bimodality of this cluster. By\nincorporating our spectroscopically-confirmed multiply-imaged systems, a reoptimization is necessary. To do\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthis, we use the new bayesian optimization method provided by the Lenstool software2(Kneib 1993, Jullo et\nal. in prep.) so that we can derive error estimates for each optimized parameter. The software optimizes the\nlocations of each system in the source plane, based on the following \u03c72 estimator, which defines the goodness\nof the fit:\nX\n\u03c72i\n(1)\n\u03c72 =\ni\n\n\u03c72i\n\nwhere\nis the same estimator for a given multiply-imaged system i, constructed by comparing the predicted\nB\npositions of the N observed images in the source plane (xi,j , yi,j ) to their barycenter (xB\ni , yi ):\n\u03c72i =\n\n2\nB 2\n1 X (xi,j \u2212 xB\ni ) + (yi,j \u2212 yi )\n2\nN\n\u03c3pos\n\n(2)\n\nj=1..N\n\n\u03c3pos is the uncertainty in measuring the position of each image in the source plane. We use a typical value\nof \u03c3I = 0.2\u2032\u2032 for the same uncertainty in the image plane, and relate it to \u03c3pos with the amplification A:\n2\n\u03c3I2 = A \u03c3pos\n.\nFor its important influence on the position of systems C15 and C20, we choose to optimize the velocity\ndispersion and the cut radius of the third brightest cluster galaxy. We also optimize the same parameters\nfor the BCG and the galaxy #106 (adjacent to image C0c), in order to match the location of all images from\nthe C0 system.\nThe associated reduced \u03c72 is \u223c 1.7, with 21 degrees of freedom, and the astrometric error on the position\nof the predicted multiple images is 0.37\u2032\u2032 in the image plane. The new parameters of the mass model are\npresented in Table 4. The optimized values are slightly higher than the ones we obtain by using only their\nluminosity as a parameter for the gravitational potential. However, those values are not sufficiently high to\npropose a third dark matter clump. As additional confirmation for the quality of the mass model, we also\nchecked that all spectroscopically-confirmed background sources for which we did not identify multiple-image\nsystems were predicted to be singly-imaged.\nIn comparison with the results from S05, we have refined the mass model by increasing the number of\nconstrained parameters from 11 to 21, while keeping a similar reduced \u03c72 value. In particular, we optimized\nthe location of the second dark matter clump, where we have the main differences in the confirmed multiply\nimaged systems, and constrained individual parameters for two particular galaxies, in complement to the\nBCG.\n\n4.2.\n\nResults from the Mass Model\n\nOur improved mass model of Abell 68 enables us to compute a lensing mass of the cluster by integrating\nthe derived surface mass density within a given projected distance R. Within a physical radius R < 500\nkpc, we obtain a value Mlensing = 5.31 \u00b1 0.17 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 . This is somewhat higher than the value of\n4.4\u00b10.1 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 derived by S05. By comparing both models using the individual parameters given in\ntable 4, this difference arises mainly because of the higher mass of the second dark matter clump, for which we\nderive higher \u03c30 and rcut values compared to S05. The remaining model parameters (the location, ellipticity\nand orientation) lie within 3\u03c3. We argue that the parameters of the secondary clump are better constrained\nin our model, given the identification of new multiple images to the NW of the cluster. The difference\n2 For\n\nmore information and to download the latest version of the code, see http://www.oamp.fr/cosmology/lenstool\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nwith S05 is further revealed by computing the ratio Mcen /Mtot between the mass of the central component\n(with sole contributions from the main clump and the BCG) and the total mass within 500 kpc. We find\nMcen /Mtot = 0.56 \u00b1 0.05, lower than the value of 0.68 derived by S05. This strengthens the bimodal nature\nof Abell 68. Our parameters for the individual contributing galaxies are quite similar to S05, except for the\n\u2217\nlow rcut\nvalue, indicating that the haloes have a smaller spatial extent.\nWithin the uncertainties, we are now able to predict the location and expected fluxes of the counterimages for the observed multiple systems C2, C10 and C23. Furthermore, the model gives us an estimate of\nthe redshift for the multiple systems C2 and C10 which do not yet have spectroscopic measurements. These\npredictions are summarized in Table 3 as bracketed values.\nIn the process of the bayesian optimization, the software computes the magnification factors and the\nrelated error estimates, for each source included in the spectroscopic catalog or the multiple images catalog.\nThese values are reported in Table 2 and 3, respectively.\nApart from the multiple-image systems described before, all other background sources in our spectroscopic catalog (C4, C7, C8, C12, C14, C24, C25, C26, C27) are predicted to be singly-imaged. This is\ncompatible with our morphological data. For other sources that do not show multiple images (C3, C5, C9,\nC11, C13, C18), we use the mass model to predict their maximum redshift zmax . As the radius of the\ncritical line increases with source redshift zs , a multiple image is expected if zs > zmax . These zmax values\nare summarized in Table 3 and are consistent with the observed optical colors. Image C18 is predicted to\nbe a single image at any redshift.\n\n5.\n\nPhysical Properties of Faint Lyman-\u03b1 Emitters\n\nVia our spectroscopic campaign and improved mass model, we are now in a position to explore the\nphysical properties and luminosity distribution of a large sample of intrinsically faint 2 < z < 6 sources. We\nrecognize that the volumes sampled may be unrepresentative but that our survey illustrates, by example,\nthe promise of more extensive surveys that may soon be possible with larger cluster samples.\nFirst we selected from our spectroscopic catalog a subsample of seven high redshift sources (z > 1.5),\nwhich all have clearly detected Lyman-\u03b1 emission lines. The measured rest-frame equivalent widths W\nexceed 2 \u00c5, and the majority have W & 10 \u00c5 . By contrast, typical LAEs selected within narrow-band\nsurveys have W & 30 \u00c5 .

These physical values are derived and summarized in Table 5.\n\n5.1.\n\nStar Formation Rates\n\nWe explore two ways of determining the instantaneous star formation rate (SFR) for a high redshift\nLAE, both using the calibration from Kennicutt (1998) who assumed a Salpeter (1955) initial mass function\nwith mass limits 0.1 and 100 M\u2299 . The first calibration is based on the UV continuum luminosity L1500 , at\n1500 \u00c5 in rest-frame, with the following relationship:\n\u22121\n\nSFR UV (M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 1.05 \u00d7 10\u221240 L1500 (ergs s\u22121 \u00c5\n\n)\n\n(3)\n\nWe estimated the individual L1500 values in this sample through the broad-band photometric measurements.\nThe second calibration adopted from Kennicutt (1998) is based on the intrinsic luminosity within the\nLyman-\u03b1 emission line, assuming no extinction and case B recombination (Brocklehurst 1971) :\nSFR Ly \u03b1 (M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 9.1 \u00d7 10\u221243 LLy \u03b1 (ergs s\u22121 )\n\n(4)\n\nThe corresponding SFR estimates are given in Table 5.\nIn most cases, we find good agreement between these two estimates, with a trend for SFR Ly,\u03b1 to be\nlower than SFRUV , with a mean ratio SFR UV /SFRLy \u03b1 \u223c 1 \u2212 4. We interpret this difference as due to the\nspecific properties of Lyman-\u03b1 emission, which usually show some self-absorption or dust extinction. The\nratio above is quite similar to that, \u223c 3, typically found in high-redshift Lyman-\u03b1 samples (Santos et al.\n2004; Ajiki et al. 2003), as well as for the most distant galaxies at z \u223c 6.5 (Hu et al. 2002; Kodaira et al.\n2003). We notice two exceptions for C27 and C25; these show much higher SFR ratios (\u223c 50). Since C27\nshows a double-nucleus, its UV emission may be coming from an AGN. For C25, we estimate a 0.6\u2032\u2032 -offset\nbetween the center of the star-forming region and the center of the LRIS slit (originally aligned on C15a\nand C15b). Conceivably we missed the majority of the light coming from this object, which may explain the\ndiscrepancy.\n\n5.2.\n\nStellar Masses\n\nNext we combine the constraints from multiband photometry and spectroscopic redshifts to derive\nestimates of the stellar mass associated with each source. A key question is whether LAEs are being seen at\na special stage in their evolution, for example with a high star formation rate but low stellar mass. In this\ncalculation, prior to SED fitting, it is important to remove the contribution of the Lyman-\u03b1 flux from the\nphotometric measurements.\nWe derive the stellar mass using the Bayesian stellar mass code developed by Bundy et al. (2005), which\ncompares the SED of each object with a grid of synthetic SEDs from Bruzual & Charlot (2003), assuming\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\na Chabrier (2003) Initial Mass Function. The star-formation history is parametrized as an exponential\ndecaying burst SFR \u221d exp \u2212t/\u03c4 . In addition, the code gives an error estimate for each stellar mass, combining\nphotometric errors and degeneracies in the model parameter space (age, reddening, metallicity, star-formation\nhistory). At 2 . z . 5.5, photometric measurements or upper limits in the 7 filters from Table 2.1 cover\nthe restframe UV and optical wavelengths, which is the main limiting factor in deriving stellar masses.\nDepending on the number of photometric bands (2 to 7) where a LAE is detected, the typical errors arising\nfrom the degeneracies in model parameters cover the range 0.1 to 0.5 in log10 (M\u2217 ). It was not possible to\nderive a stellar mass for C26, because it is only detected in the RF 702W filter.\nStellar masses, corrected for magnification, are reported in Table 5. We also compute the inverse of the\nspecific star formation rate (star formation rate per unit stellar mass, Brinchmann et al. (e.g. 2004)) based\non the SFR UV estimate. This gives an indication on which timescale the star formation is taking place in\neach object. We find typical values of 500 Myr to 1 Gyr, suggesting that higher star formation may have\noccured in these LAEs during the past, unless they were formed very early.\n\n5.3.\n\nPhysical scales\n\nIn addition to brightening the observed flux of background sources, the magnification also stretches the\nangular sizes of the lensed images. This affects all the object shape parameters (a, b, \u03b8), increasing the\nobserved solid angle by the same factor \u03bc. We are thus able to probe a physical scale R in the source plane,\nwith:\n\nR=\n\ns\n\nab\nDA (z)\n\u03bc\n\n(5)\n\nwhere DA (z) is the angular distance for a source at z.\nFor most of the high redshift sources which are not resolved (along one direction) in the HST image, this\nvalue of R is an upper limit (Table 5). In most cases, we find that we are able to probe high redshift sources\nat sub-kiloparsec scales. Another interesting physical property we derive is the intrinsic surface density of\nstar formation (\u03a3 = SFR UV /(\u03c0 R2 )), which is a lower limit when sources are unresolved.\n\n5.4.\n\nLyman-\u03b1 emission surrounding C4\n\nWe now turn to a specific issue relating to the origin of the so-called Lyman-\u03b1 blobs, of which C4 at\nz = 2.63 is the first lensed example. We have used the updated mass model to reconstruct the source-plane\nmorphology of C4 . The high magnification (\u223c 4 mags.) enables us to resolve the source morphology at \u223c 30\npc scales. The galaxy displays a bright component with an intrinsic elongated shape and several knots, at\na scale length of \u223c3 kpc along the major axis. A fainter component having a similar shape and one bright\nknot is located \u223c 4.6 kpc away (Fig. 5, fourth panel). Such an elongated shape and small physical scale\nis not uncommon among high redshift galaxies: Ravindranath et al. (2006) have measured that \u223c 50% of\ngalaxies in their sample of z > 2.5 LBGs taken from GOODS show a bar-like morphology, and scale lengths\nof about 1.7 \u2212 2. kpc.\nThe strong Lyman-\u03b1 emission of C4 detected with LRIS was also identified in the VIMOS/IFU data\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nz\n\u03bc (mags)\nL1500 a\nfLy \u03b1 b\nLLy \u03b1 c\nSFR UV d\nSFR Ly \u03b1 d\nlog10 (M\u2217 /M\u2299 )\nR(kpc)\n\u03a3e\nM\u2217 /SFR f\n\nC27\n1.75\n1.72\n6.1\n4.6\u00b10.6\n2.1\u00b10.3\n6.4\n0.19\u00b10.03\n9.6 \u00b1 0.1\n2.8\n0.25\n6.2\n\nC4\n2.63\n4.15\n5.5\n9.3\u00b10.6\n1.6\u00b10.1\n5.8\n0.15\u00b10.01\n8.7 \u00b1 0.2\n2.2\n0.38\n0.9\n\nC20c\n2.69\n3.61\n0.41\n4.8\u00b10.4\n1.4\u00b10.1\n0.44\n0.13\u00b10.01\n8.4 \u00b1 0.3\n< 0.36\n> 1.08\n5.7\n\nC25\n2.69\n1.12\n4.6\n1.3\u00b10.5\n2.9\u00b11.1\n4.8\n0.26\u00b10.09\n9.7 \u00b1 0.1\n< 0.72\n> 2.94\n10.4\n\nC23a\n3.13\n2.37\n0.39\n1.5\u00b10.3\n1.4\u00b10.28\n0.41\n0.13\u00b10.03\n8.6 \u00b1 0.5\n< 0.37\n> 0.95\n9.7\n\nC26\n3.68\n2.06\n0.24\n2.6\u00b10.2\n3.4\u00b10.3\n0.25\n0.31\u00b10.03\nN/A\n< 0.34\n> 0.68\nN/A\n\nC15ab\n5.42\n2.79\n3.68\n9.7\u00b10.8\n29\u00b12.4\n3.9\n2.62\u00b10.22\n9.4 \u00b1 0.3\n< 0.28\n> 15.8\n6.4\n\nEllis et al.\n5.58\n3.80\n0.21\n6.8\u00b10.7\n6.9\u00b10.7\n0.22\n0.35\u00b10.04\n8.2 \u00b1 0.2\n< 0.19\n> 1.93\n7.2\n\nTable 5: Summary of physical properties derived for all LAEs at z > 1.5 in our sample, and comparison\nwith the mean values of the source at z \u223c 5.6 found by Ellis et al.

From left to right: rest-frame\nequivalent-width mapping of the Lyman-\u03b1 emission (with corresponding color-scale), contours of Lyman-\u03b1\nemission overplotted on the HST image, R-band reconstruction of C4 in the source plane.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n(Fig. 5, first panel). Compared with the observed size of the arc in the continuum image R702 (4\u00d71.2\u2032\u2032 )\nthis emission is significantly more extended (\u223c15\u00d73\u2032\u2032, third panel of Fig. 5). After correction for an average\nmagnification, this corresponds to an intrinsic scale of \u223c 10 kpc.\nWe use the R702W image to estimate the continuum flux of C4 at the wavelength of the Lyman\u03b1 emission, after applying a k-correction factor assuming a UV spectral slope of 2.0 typical of starburst\ngalaxies. By comparing the spatial coverage of the Lyman-\u03b1 emission and the continuum, we construct\na map of rest-frame Lyman-\u03b1 equivalent width W0 (Fig. 5, second and third panel). The W0 values are\ntypically in the range 5 < W0 < 10 \u00c5 in the region detected on the HST image. However, the map shows\na significant increase of Lyman-\u03b1 equivalent width, with values W0 > 10 \u00c5, in the northern part of the\narc, where the continuum is hardly visible in R band. Because of the size of the blob and the presence\nof this stronger stellar continuum at the center of C4, the most probable mechanism producing such an\nextended Lyman-\u03b1 emission is the presence of a superwind outflow originating from the central starburst\nTaniguchi et al. (2001); Wilman et al. (2005).\nWe also observed C4 with 2 different LRIS configurations, located across or along the longer dimension\nof the arc (Fig. 6). In both cases, we observed two different components to the Lyman-\u03b1 line on the 2D\nspectrum : a stronger emission centered around 4411 \u00c5 and a fainter emission region at a slightly bluer\nwavelength (4408 \u00c5 ). The LRIS data also shows a tilt in the emission region, due to an offset in the\ncentral peak of the Lyman-\u03b1 line (top panel of Fig. 6). These components may be related to the different\nstar-forming regions identified morphologically in the HST image. Unfortunately, because of the poorer\nresolution, no similar offset in the central wavelength or variations in the line profile were detected in the\nIFU data.\nThe main difference between C4 and the very luminous Lyman-\u03b1 blobs is its very small physical size\n: 2.2 kpc, compared with the R > 30 kpc selection criteria for Lyman-\u03b1 blobs adopted by Matsuda et al.\n(2004), along with the rest-frame equivalent width criterion Wo > 20 \u00c5 . For this reason, it is more likely\nthat the associated physical processes may be different, the size of C4 being more similar to extended Lyman\u03b1 emssions observed around star-forming galaxies. In this strongly lensed case, the effects of outflows on\nthe Lyman-\u03b1 emission can be studied in higher details by way of the lensing magnification, stretching the\nobserved scales.\n\n5.5.\n\nIntrinsic properties of the z = 5.4 source\n\nWe finally turn to the most distant lensed source, C15, at z = 5.4, and whether it is a further example\nof the intriguing lensed source detected at z=5.6 by Ellis et al. (2001) in Abell 2218.\nC15 has an intrinsic Lyman-\u03b1 luminosity of \u223c 3 \u00d7 1042 ergs s\u22121 . This is about 5 times fainter than\ntypical values found for z \u223c 5.7 LAEs targetted by narrow-band searches (Hu et al. 2004; Shimasaku et al.\n2006), but not too dissimilar to those in the much fainter z \u223c 6.5 sample from Kashikawa et al. (2006) who\nused very deep (\u223c 10 ks) spectroscopy with Keck and Subaru to confirm 17 faint LAEs.\nAll three images of this source are unresolved along the shear direction, and therefore suggest a very\nsmall physical scale R . 300 pc in the source plane. More interestingly, we infer a minimum star formation\nsurface density of \u223c 16 M\u2299 kpc\u22122 , which is much higher than for any other object in our sample, making\nthis source similar to the most active star forming regions at any redshift.\nThe strong Lyman-\u03b1 emission dominates the optical flux and in this respect it is very similar to the z \u223c\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n5.6 object found by Ellis et al. (2001) in the cluster Abell 2218. To compare these sources, we have performed\na re-analysis of the photometric data for that object, taking into account HST data that arrived for Abell\n2218 subsequent to the Ellis et al. (2001) analysis. This includes HST/ACS, NICMOS and Spitzer/IRAC\nobservations presented by Kneib et al. (2004) and Egami et al. (2005). We find that the Ellis et al source is\nnow detected in the IF 814W , zF 850LP , JF 110W and H160W filters (Fig. 7 and Table 6). The source is faint\n(AB\u223c 26.6) and remains undetected with IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. However, the IRAC upper limits\nare quite high (around AB\u223c24), due to the proximity of the BCG (\u223c 15\u2032\u2032 ) and coarse point spread function.\nIn order to compare the revised data with that for C15, we compute and incorporate in the last column of\nTable 5 various physical properties for the Ellis et al. object alongside those for the other Lyman-\u03b1 emitters.\nWhen deriving the stellar mass, we note the significant change implied by the new data (M\u2217 \u223c 108 M\u2299 c.f.\n106\u22127 M\u2299 given by Ellis et al). The major change arises from different assumptions : in order to reproduce\nthe observed Lyman-\u03b1 emission and the non-detection of the UV spectral continuum in LRIS, Ellis et al\nused the STARBURST99 spectrophotometric code Leitherer et al. (1999) to derive an upper limit of 2 Myrs\non the age of the source, assuming a constant SFR and no extinction.\nAlthough the new HST photometry of this object is restricted to the rest-frame wavelength \u03bb < 2500\n\u00c5, the SED fitting method used in our reanalysis should be more reliable because it is based on fewer\nassumptions, especially on the star-formation history. Our best SED fitting model also predicts Spitzer/IRAC\ncontinuum fluxes consistent with the non-detection of this pair in the 3.6 \u03bcm and 4.5 \u03bcm bands.\nCompared with the z \u223c 5.6 galaxy from Ellis et al. (2001), C15 is less magnified and is intrinsically\nmore luminous and more massive, although with a similar physical size. The mass model predicts the source\nto be located \u223c 2.4 kpc from the caustic line in the source plane. This suggests we are actually seeing a\ntrue small isolated object, since any similarly bright region close to C15 would also be highly magnified and\nmultiply imaged.\nAnother difference between the two sources arises from the rest-frame UV stellar continuum, which\nis detected in the LRIS spectrum of the z \u223c 5.4 source redward of the Lyman-\u03b1 emission. Running the\nSTARBURST99 code on this object in a similar way as done by Ellis et al. (2001), the upper limit on the\nage is much larger, typically 50 \u2212 100 Myrs, with a constant SFR of 2.6 M\u2299 .yr\u22121 . This gives a total mass of\n\u223c 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , which is closer to the SED fitting estimate, in comparison with the source in Abell 2218.\nAt the time of its discovery, the Ellis et al. (2001) object revealed a very small and low-mass (106\u22127 )\nsource at z \u223c 5.6, which was also reported to be very young. With the new photometric reanalysis, and\nby finding another example of a LAE with similar size and Lyman-\u03b1 flux, it is more probable that we are\nobserving two 108 to 109 M\u2299 objects with very different star-formation histories. The Ellis et al. source\npreviously formed the majority of its stellar mass and is having a very young burst, whereas C15 has been\nforming stars for a larger time scale.\nVF 606W\n> 28.14\n\nIF 814W\n26.94 \u00b1 0.18\n\nzF 850LP\n26.67 \u00b1 0.15\n\nJF 110W\n26.60 \u00b1 0.28\n\nHF 160W\n26.62 \u00b1 0.33\n\nIRAC3.6\u03bcm\n> 24.1\n\nIRAC4.5\u03bcm\n> 24.3\n\nTable 6: Broad-band photometry of the z = 5.6 galaxy discovered by Ellis et al.

(2003), of RAB < 25.5 at z \u223c 3 and the faintest LAEs found with narrow-band searches\n(e.g., Fynbo et al. 2003; Gawiser et al. 2006; Shimasaku et al. 2006). Moreover, the lensed Lyman-\u03b1 sources\nhave much lower equivalent widths, similar to those seen in LBGs (Shapley et al. 2003).\nThe derived properties of the Lyman-\u03b1 emitters are dependent on the individual magnification factors\n\u03bc used to correct each image for the lensing effects. The error estimates on \u03bc, computed by the bayesian\noptimization method, range from 1 to 16 % and were quadratically added to the measurement errors in\nTable 5, in the case of LLy \u03b1 , SFRLy \u03b1 and M\u2217 . In each case, the photometry is the dominant source of\nerror. We acknowledge these values of \u03bc are still dependent on the approach used to parametrize the mass\nmodel, for instance the use of the PIEMD profile for the dark matter haloes. Nevertheless, the Lyman-\u03b1\nemitters presented here are strongly lensed and have been identified in the central regions of the cluster,\nwhere the magnification factors are associated with the location of the critical lines. These critical lines are\nconstrained by the same set of multiple images, quite independently of the parametrization used for the mass\nmodel (PIEMD or Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile). Therefore, we are confident that the computed\nmagnification factors are reliable.\nAlthough such a lensing survey is not strictly flux-limited, we can use this unique probe to gauge the\nproperties of the faintest LAEs yet located at z > 2. We find the typical stellar masses are log10 (M\u2217 /M\u2299 ) \u223c\n8.5 to 9.5. These values are similar to the typical stellar masses of the bright LAEs from Gawiser et al.\n(2006), found by selecting very high equivalent width (W0 > 150) LAEs at z=3.1. Our LAEs have fainter\nUV and Lyman-\u03b1 luminosities, and therefore a lower SFR, by typically 1 to 2 magnitudes. Even if the\nwavelength range covered by the broad-band photometry dominates the errors in the stellar masses derived\nin both surveys, this is indicative that, at comparable stellar masses, our LAEs are more quiescent than the\nobjects found in narrow-band searches.\nRecognizing the limitations of our sample, as a point of illustration, we compare on Fig. 8 the luminosity\nrange of our lensed emitters with current constraints on the cumulative Lyman-\u03b1 luminosity function at\nz \u223c 3, mostly based on narrow-band searches. The number of dedicated searches for LAEs at z \u223c 3 from the\nliterature is quite limited. We report in this diagram the compilation of 5 samples, either in blank fields or\noverdense environments, presented by Fynbo et al. (2001), as well as an estimate of the number density from\na Ly\u03b1 survey in the GOODS-south field (Nilsson et al. (2006) and Nilsson et al. 2007, to be submitted).\nBased on our subsample of 6 emitters at 2 . z . 3.7 and the surface area probed in the high magnification\n\u22123\nregion (\u03bc > 0.75 mag.) of the source plane, we estimate a number density of 4.3+2.6\nMpc\u22123 down to\n\u22121.7 \u00d7 10\n41\n\u22121\nL = 1.4 \u00d7 10 ergs s . Because our spectroscopy only sparsely covered this region, we report this value as\na lower limit in Fig. 8. Although we acknowledge the limits due to very small statistics and the small areas\nprobed in these lensed surveys, our sample of z \u223c 3 emitters gives constraints at fainter luminosities that\nany of the narrow-band searches at this redshift. More observations are however needed in order to better\nconstrain the faint-end slope of this luminosity function.\nAn interesting question is the likelihood of finding highly magnified sources at z \u223c 5.5 like C15 and the\nsource reported by Ellis et al. (2001) : we can estimate this through the space density of R-dropouts in our\nmagnified field of view. Based on our photometric RIz color-color selection technique (see Sect. 3.1), we\nidentified one source in the field of view covered by the HST image. Since it is detected at \u223c 8 \u03c3 level in the\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Cumulative luminosity function of Lyman-\u03b1 emitters. Red datapoints are z \u223c 3 estimates from\nFynbo et al. (2001), either in overdense regions (open circles) or blank fields (crosses). We also give recent\nresults at z \u223c 3.1 from a Ly\u03b1 survey in GOODS-South (Nilsson et al. 2007, to be submitted). Black points\ncorrespond to the compilation of z \u223c 5 surveys from Santos et al. (2004) and black curves are more recent\nfits to the z \u223c 5.7 Luminosity Function by Shimasaku et al. (2006). We overplot in blue number density\nestimates based on the sample of 6 Ly\u03b1 emitters at 1.7 < z < 3.7.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nI-band filter, where R-dropouts are brighter, and has a magnification factor of \u03bc \u223c 2.5, we computed the\neffective covolume in the source plane having \u03bc > 0.75, taking into account the reduction of the surface area\ndue to lensing effects. We derive an effective covolume of 420 Mpc3 , in the redshift range 5 < z < 6 probed\n\u22123\nby our set of filters. Assuming Poisson noise statistics, we obtain a rough estimate of 2.4+5.4\nMpc\u22123\n\u22122.0 \u00d710\nfor the number counts of R-dropouts. Although cosmic variance effects can be quite large when probing such\na small volume, this result is in good agreement with the space density of low-luminosity Lyman-\u03b1 sources\nat z \u223c 5, on the above-mentioned diagram (Fig. 8).\nFrom these simple calculations, C15 does not seem to be a serendipitous case of low-luminosity z \u223c 5\nLAE, since we would expect to find one such source in the magnified region of the cluster. By observing\na larger number of lensed fields, such as the new HST clusters imaged by ACS, we could build a more\nsignificant sample of similar objects and compare their physical properties.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have performed a spectroscopic analysis of background sources in the field of the massive cluster\nAbell 68 and identified 26 lensed images in the range 0.3 < z < 5.5, including 7 Lyman-\u03b1 emitters at z > 1.7.\nUsing the new redshift measurements and identification of new multiple-image systems, we perform a precise\nmodeling of the cluster mass distribution with 5 spectroscopic systems, and also predict the redshift and\ncounter-images for two remaining systems. This makes Abell 68 one of the best-modelled lensing clusters,\nalong with Abell 1689 and Abell 2218, allowing for the precise measurement of its dark-matter distribution.\nWe derived the star formation rates, stellar masses and physical scales for our sample of high-redshift\nLyman-\u03b1 emitters. The broad-band luminosities of these objects is comparable to the faint LAEs found in\ndeep narrow-band searches, but their equivalent widths are much lower, making them 1 to 2 magnitudes\nfainter in Lyman-\u03b1 luminosity. Two of these sources show a more extended Lyman-\u03b1 emission region, when\ncompared to the stellar continuum in the HST image. For one of them, we demonstrated how we use IFU\ndata to probe regions with distinct Lyman-\u03b1 equivalent widths. The stretch provided by lensing enables us\nto characterize small regions of Lyman-\u03b1 emission which would otherwise be beyond reach of ground based\nIntegral Field Instruments. Although the large equivalent widths are comparable to giant Lyman-\u03b1 blobs\nobserved around massive forming galaxies, we interpret the small physical scales of these lensed emissions\nas outflows originating from a central starburst.\nThe highest redshift z \u223c 5.4 multiple-image source of this sample is very similar to the pair of stronglylensed images identified by Ellis et al. (2001) in Abell 2218, in terms of magnification and physical size, albeit\nbeing intrinsically more massive and more luminous. We therefore expect to detect it in IRAC images of\nsimilar depth as the data presented in Egami et al. (2005), in the first two channels of this instrument. Such\nmeasurements would tighten the constraints on the stellar mass of this source, by reducing the degeneracies\nin the other model parameters, and also provide additional information on its age and star-formation history,\nwhen combined with the properties of the Lyman-\u03b1 emission.\nOur survey provides the first tentative indications of the density of faint Lyman-\u03b1 emitters at z \u223c 3,\ndown to unlensed fluxes of \u223c 2 \u00d7 1041 . Although our survey is not flux-limited nor complete in any formal\nsense, the cumulative Lyman-\u03b1 luminosity function we derive indicates the promise of a dedicated search\nfor lensed Lyman-\u03b1 emitters through larger samples of well-mapped clusters now being surveyed with HST,\nand the ability of this approach to complement narrow-band searches carried out in blank fields.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for his helpful comments, and acknowledge helpful discussions with\nJohan Fynbo, Kim Nilsson, Fabrice Lamareille, Mark Swinbank and Tommaso Treu.
