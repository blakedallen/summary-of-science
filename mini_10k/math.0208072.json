We\nalso present and compare various definitions of a box complex of a graph (developing\nideas of Alon, Frankl, and Lov\u00e1sz and of K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e). A suitable box complex is equivalent\nto Lov\u00e1sz' complex, but the construction is simpler and functorial, mapping graphs with\nhomomorphisms to Z2 -spaces with Z2 -maps.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGraph coloring is a classical combinatorial topic: For a given (finite) graph G, determine how\nto distribute a minimal number of colors to the vertices in such a way that adjacent vertices\nget different colors. The minimum number of colors is \u03c7(G), the chromatic number of the\ngraph. The graph coloring problem has numerous important practical motivations; among\nthe more recent ones, we mention that it appears as a (simplified) model for the frequency\nassignment problem in mobile communication (cf. Bornd\u00f6rfer et. al. [6] and Eisenbl\u00e4tter et\nal. [13]).\nThe most famous graph coloring problem is, of course, the Four Color Problem, asking\nwhether every planar graph can be colored by four colors, which was answered positively\nby Haken and Appell 1977 and re-solved by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour & Thomas [30].\nEven for planar graphs, though, determining 3-colorability is already algorithmically difficult\n(NP-hard), and beyond the range of planar graphs, the gaps between the upper and the lower\n1\n\n\fbounds that one can reasonably obtain for \u03c7(G) may be huge. This claim is supported both\nby theoretical results on the complexity of graph coloring algorithms (see the discussion in\nKhanna, Linial & Safra [17]) and from the perspective of combinatorial optimization (see\nMehrotra & Trick [26]).\nFor any given graph G, we obtain an upper bound on the chromatic number \u03c7(G) by\n\"guessing\" a coloring, for example, by running a coloring heuristic. (See [9] for implementations, and Reed & Molloy [28] for a theoretical study of randomized algorithms.) How can\nwe check that such an upper bound is good, that is, close to the actual chromatic number?\nWe need a lower bound on the chromatic number.\nTwo other basic graph parameters lead to straightforward \"combinatorial\" lower bounds\nfor \u03c7(G): The clique number \u03c9(G), the largest number of mutually adjacent vertices in G,\nobviously satisfies \u03c9(G) \u2264 \u03c7(G), and we also have \u03c7(G) \u2265 n/\u03b1(G) for every graph G on\nn vertices, where \u03b1(G) is the independence number of G, that is, the maximum number of\nmutually nonadjacent vertices in G. Both \u03c9(G) and \u03b1(G) are hard to compute, or even\napproximate, for general graphs. But even leaving this aside, both of these bounds may be\nvery weak, since one can construct graphs where both \u03c9(G) and n/\u03b1(G) are arbitrarily small\ncompared to \u03c7(G).\nA considerably more sophisticated lower bound for \u03c7(G) (still hard to compute in general)\nis the fractional chromatic number \u03c7f (G), which can be briefly defined as the minimum ratio\na/b such that G has a b-fold covering by a independent sets. (The name is motivated by a\nslightly different but equivalent definition, in which each color can still be used only on an\nindependent set of vertices, but one is allowed to use fractional amounts of colors, say to\ncolor a vertex by 15 of red and by 45 of blue.) The gap between \u03c7f (G) and \u03c7(G) can still be\narbitrarily large, but it is much harder to come up with examples of this. (See [28, Part VIII]\nfor further discussion.)\nActually, only very few types of such examples are known, and the arguably most im-\u0001\nportant ones are provided by Kneser graphs. The Kneser graph KGn,k has all the N = nk\nk-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} as vertices and all pairs of disjoint sets as edges. It arose\nin an innocent little problem that Martin Kneser posed in 1955 here, in the Jahresbericht\nder DMV [18]. (Apparently the problem arose from Kneser's study of a number-theoretic\npaper [16] by Kaplansky.) Kneser asked for a proof that \u03c7(KGn,k ) \u2265 n \u2212 2k + const., and\nconjectured that \u03c7(KGn,k ) = n \u2212 2k + 2, where \u03c7(KGn,k ) \u2264 n \u2212 2k + 2 is easy to verify using\na simple greedy coloring.\nKneser's question posed a substantial challenge since all the classical lower bounds listed\nabove fail for Kneser graphs. For suitable parameters, say for n = 3k \u2212 1, we have:\n\u2022 The chromatic number is large, \u03c7(KG3k\u22121,k ) = k + 1, and an optimal coloring is easy to\nfind (by a greedy approach).\n\u2022 At the same time, the clique number is small, \u03c9(KG3k\u22121,k ) = 2 (the graph is triangle-free\nfor n < 3k).\n\u0001\n\u2022 The independence number is huge, \u03b1(KG3k\u22121,k ) = n\u22121\nk\u22121 , and thus the corresponding lower\nbound for the chromatic number, which also happens to agree with the fractional chromatic\nnumber, are small: N/\u03b1(KG3k\u22121,k ) = \u03c7f (KG3k\u22121,k ) = 3k\u22121\nk < 3.\nOther, more \"algebraic\" types of lower bounds on the chromatic numbers of graphs, in terms\nof the Lov\u00e1sz theta function (see Lov\u00e1sz [23] and Knuth [19]) or on the eigenvalues of the\nadjacency matrix (see van Lint & Wilson [33, Chap. 31] and Godsil & Royle [14, Chap. 9])\ndo not help to close the gap in the case of Kneser graphs.\nIn 1978 Lov\u00e1sz [22] settled Kneser's conjecture by an original application of a tool from\n2\n\n\fAlgebraic Topology, the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem. He thus provided a completely new type of\nlower bound which in the case of the Kneser conjecture was tight.\nIn subsequent years a number of new proofs of the Kneser conjecture and of various\nextensions of it became available. All of them are of topological nature, and all of them\ndepend on the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem or some variant of it. (This remains essentially true\ndespite recent demonstrations that some proofs can be combinatorialized [24], [37], since the\nunderlying ideas are still topological.) The proof methods are diverse, though, and at first\nsight they look almost unrelated.\nThe Kneser graphs KGn,k are quite special, but the methods known for proving Kneser's\nconjecture, starting with Lov\u00e1sz's [22] break-through, extend beyond the original examples:\nEach of them yields, explicitly or implicitly, a lower bound for the chromatic number of any\ngraph (as we will see, every graph is a \"generalized Kneser graph\"), although they are rather\nweak for some classes of graphs. These bounds are, of course, all tight in the case of the\nKneser graphs KGn,k , but otherwise their strengths are apparently different: For example,\nonly some of them yield tight bounds for the chromatic number of certain subgraphs of the\nKneser graphs investigated by Schrijver [32].\nIn the following, we will compare the various \"topological lower bounds on the chromatic\nnumber.\" In the course of our arguments, we also sketch proofs for them; some of these\nproofs are quite elementary and simple, and sometimes considerably simpler than the original\nderivations.\nWe show that, surprisingly, the topological lower bounds for the chromatic number resulting from known proofs fall neatly into a hierarchy, which is essentially linearly ordered.\nSo, we show that \"(the index version of) the Lov\u00e1sz' bound is stronger than the (generalized)\nSarkaria bound, which is stronger than the (generalized) B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound, and also stronger\nthan the Dol'nikov\u2013K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e bound.\" (This, of course, should not indicate any comparison of\nthe usefulness of the methods or of the interest of the papers. The hierarchy concerns only\nthe bounds that, in principle, can be obtained by straightforward generalizations of these\napproaches, and it does not say anything about the feasibility of actually obtaining these\nbounds.)\nLov\u00e1sz' proof and box complexes. A slightly modernized version of Lov\u00e1sz' original\nproof works along the following lines. To every graph G, one assigns a topological space\nT (G). The construction goes via a simplicial complex. This, on the one hand, is a purely\ncombinatorial object (a hereditary set system), and on the other hand, it is canonically\nassociated with a topological space (the geometric realization). Then, for every coloring of\nG by m colors, one constructs a continuous map from the space T (G) to the space T (Km )\nassigned to the complete graph Km . To show that G has no m-coloring, it suffices to exclude\nthe existence of a continuous map T (G) \u2192 T (Km ).\nOf course, things cannot be as simple as this, since every topological space has a continuous\nmap to any nonempty topological space, namely, a constant map. One has to consider extra\nstructure on the space T (G), called a Z2 -action. A Z2 -action on a topological space T is a\nhomeomorphism \u03bd : T \u2192 T such that \u03bd(\u03bd(x)) = x for every x \u2208 T . A primary example of\na topological space with a Z2 -action, or a Z2 -space, is the n-dimensional unit sphere S n in\nRn+1 with the Z2 -action given by x 7\u2192 \u2212x, i. e., the antipodality.\nThe cleverly constructed space T (G) comes equipped with a Z2 -action \u03bd = \u03bdG , and for\nG = Km , the space T (Km ) even miraculously happens to be (equivalent to) a sphere with the\nantipodality as the Z2 -action! (The dimension of this sphere depends on m, and as we will see,\n3\n\n\fit may differ slightly in various possible constructions of T (G).) Moreover, the continuous\nmap f : T (G) \u2192 T (Km ) obtained from an m-coloring of G is a Z2 -map, meaning that it\ncommutes with the Z2 -actions: f (\u03bdG (x)) = \u03bdKm (f (x)).\nHere the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem enters. The most popular version of it states that for\nevery continuous map f : S n \u2192 Rn , there is a point x \u2208 S n with f (x) = f (\u2212x). However,\nan equivalent version asserts that there is no Z2 -map S n \u2192 S m for m < n. A suitable\ngeneralization of this result can sometimes be used to show that, for a particular graph G,\nthere is no Z2 -map of T (G) into T (Km ), and consequently, that G is not m-colorable.\nThis high-level outline of Lov\u00e1sz' does not tell one how to construct suitable spaces T (G).\nWe should also remark that Lov\u00e1sz' original proof proceeded in a slightly different way,\nwithout explicitly introducing the Z2 -map. A class of constructions which allows to phrase\nthe proof in the simple and conceptual way sketched above are various box complexes assigned\nto a graph, which can successfully play the role of T (G) in the above discussion. A box\ncomplex first appears in Alon, Frankl, and Lov\u00e1sz [1] (where it was defined for hypergraphs),\nand another version was used by K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20].\nFormal definitions of box complexes will be given later, but roughly we can say that a box\ncomplex of a graph G is made of all complete bipartite subgraphs of G. A complete bipartite\nsubgraph of G is specified by two disjoint subsets A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 of the vertex set, such that every\nvertex a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 is connected by an edge to every vertex a\u2032\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032\u2032 . The exchange of the subsets\nA\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 yields an involution on the box complex, and makes it into a Z2 -space.\nOn an intuitive level, the construction of the continuous Z2 -map from the box complex\nof G into the box complex of Km can be described as follows (we are indebted by Lov\u00e1sz\nfor a beautiful summary of the proof, which inspired much of the present discussion): If c\nis a proper m-coloring of G, then whenever two disjoint sets A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 determine a complete\nbipartite subgraph in G, they are assigned two disjoint color sets c(A\u2032 ) and c(A\u2032\u2032 ), which\nthus determine a complete bipartite subgraph of Km . Furthermore, if B \u2032 \u2287 A\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 \u2287 A\u2032\u2032\ngive a larger complete bipartite subgraph, they receive larger color sets c(B \u2032 ) \u2287 c(A\u2032 ) and\nc(B \u2032\u2032 ) \u2287 c(A\u2032\u2032 ). This allows one to define the continuous map of the box complexes. Finally,\nif we interchange A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 , the color sets are interchanged as well, and this makes the map\nof the box complexes a Z2 -map.\nSummarizing, an m-coloring of G yields a Z2 -map of the box complex of G into the box\ncomplex of Km . If we use the convenient notion of the index of a Z2 -space, which is the\nsmallest m such that the Z2 -space can be Z2 -mapped into the sphere S m with the antipodal\nZ2 -action, we get that the index of the box complex of any m-colorable graph has to be at\nleast as large as the index of the box complex of Km . The latter can be computed once and\nfor all (as we remarked above, the box complex of Km happens to be equivalent to a sphere\nwith the antipodal action). Thus, the application of this method boils down to bounding\nbelow the index of the box complex of G.\nInterestingly, these ideas have several different implementations: there are several distinct\npossibilities to define \"box complexes.\" The different box complexes have different ground\nsets, they are of different sizes (the numbers of vertices/faces differ on an exponential scale!),\nand some of them may be considerably easier to use than others.\nOur current favorite is the box complex B(G), defined in Section 3 below. It has a small\nvertex set (the disjoint union of two copies of V (G)), and it yields the strongest bounds\navailable. However, we invite the reader to survey the panorama and to make his/her own\nchoices-several more versions of box complexes are discussed in Section 5. We will show\nthat many of them are equivalent for the purposes of estimating the chromatic number.\n4\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nHere we recall some general notions, facts, and notation needed for a precise statement of the\nresults. We repeat some of the definitions mentioned in the introduction more formally.\nUnfortunately, for space reasons, we cannot afford to introduce all the required topological\nnotions at a leisurely pace, and so the rest of the paper may not be easily accessible without\nsome knowledge of Topological Combinatorics. We refer to [5] or [38] for surveys of the\nterminology and tools employed in this paper and to [25] for a detailed textbook treatment.\nOn the other hand, readers with basic knowledge of the area may perhaps want to skip this\nsection and refer to it as needed during further reading.\nGraphs. The vertex set of a graph G is written as V (G), and the edge set as E(G). We\nsuppose that all graphs are finite, simple, and undirected. In order to avoid some trivial\nspecial cases, we also assume that the considered graphs have no isolated vertices.\nA homomorphism of a graph G into a graph H is a mapping f : V (G) \u2192 V (H) that\npreserves edges; that is, {f (u), f (v)} \u2208 E(H) whenever {u, v} \u2208 E(G). For our purposes, it\nis convenient to regard a (proper) coloring of G by m colors as a homomorphism of G into\nthe complete graph Km . The chromatic number of G is denoted by \u03c7(G).\nWe regard a bipartite graph as a triple (V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2032 , E), where V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2032 \u2286 V are disjoint and\nE \u2286 {{v \u2032 , v \u2032\u2032 } : v \u2032 \u2208 V \u2032 , v \u2032\u2032 \u2208 V \u2032\u2032 }. For a bipartite graph we assume that the bipartition is\nfixed, and we also distinguish (V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2032 , E) from (V \u2032\u2032 , V \u2032 , E). Since we will be concerned with\nvarious colorings of graphs, we call the parts V \u2032 and V \u2032\u2032 of the bipartition the shores, rather\nthan the more common \"color classes.\" If A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 are disjoint subsets of the vertex set of some\ngraph G, we write G[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] for the bipartite subgraph with shores A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 induced by G.\n(Note that this is not necessarily an induced subgraph of G, since only edges between distinct\nshores are included.)\nKneser graphs.\nLet X be a finite set and F \u2286 2X a system of subsets of X. The\nKneser graph KG(F) has vertex set F, and the edges are all pairs of disjoint sets in F.\nFor notational convenience, we assume that X = [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n}, unless stated otherwise.\n\u0001\nKneser's conjecture can be succinctly stated as \u03c7(KG( [n]\n)) = n\u22122k+2 for n \u2265 2k > 0, where\nk\n[n]\u0001\n[n]\u0001\nk denotes the family of all k-element subsets of [n]. In particular, KGn,k = KG( k )).\nIt is easy to see that every (finite) graph G = (V, E) can be represented as\u0001a Kneser graph\nof some set system. A simple and natural representation is this: Let E := V2 \\ E denote the\nset of non-edges of G, and for every v \u2208 V , let us set Fv := {e \u2208 E : v \u2208 e}. The Kneser\ngraph of {Fv : v \u2208 V } is isomorphic to G; the only problem is that the sets Fv need not be\nall distinct (for example, for G = Kn , we have Fv = \u2205 for all v). To remedy this, one can\ndefine Fv\u2032 := Fv \u222a {v}, obtaining distinct sets. For a more economical representation, we can\nlet C be a covering of E by cliques (each C \u2208 C is a complete subgraph of (V, E) and each\nedge of E is contained in some C \u2208 C). For v \u2208 V , we then define Fv\u2032\u2032 := {C \u2208 C : v \u2208 C};\nthis is a potentially much smaller Kneser representation. The problem of finding a Kneser\nrepresentation with the smallest ground set, i. e., the smallest C, is the minimum clique cover\nfor the complement of G, and hence NP-complete and hard to approximate; see, e. g., Ausiello\net al. [2].\nSimplicial complexes. We use letters like K, L, . . . to denote simplicial complexes. (See,\ne. g., [29], [5], [25] for more background). We consider only finite simplicial complexes, so a\nsimplicial complex K is a nonempty hereditary set system (i. e., S \u2208 K and S \u2032 \u2282 S implies\n\n5\n\n\fS \u2032 \u2208 K); in particular, \u2205 \u2208 K. For example, 2[n] is the (n\u22121)-dimensional simplex considered as\na simplicial complex. We let V (K) denote the vertex set of K, and kKk denotes the polyhedron\nof K (but sometimes we write just K for the polyhedron too, when it is clear that we mean\na topological space). The dimension of the complex K is dim K := max{|S|\u22121 : S \u2208 K}. A\nsimplicial map of a simplicial complex K to a simplicial complex L is a map f : V (K) \u2192 V (L)\nsuch that f (S) \u2208 L for all S \u2208 K.\nFor a partially ordered set (X, \u0016), the order complex \u2206(X, \u0016) has X as the vertex set\nand all chains as simplices; that is, a simplex has the form {x1 , x2 , . . . , xk } \u2286 X with x1 \u227a\nx2 \u227a * * * \u227a xk . In particular, if F is a set system, we write \u2206F for \u2206(F \\ {\u2205}, \u2286). If K is\na simplicial complex, then \u2206K is the first barycentric subdivision of K, also denoted by sd K\n(the empty simplex \u2205 is not a vertex of the barycentric subdivision, and this is the reason for\nremoving \u2205 in the definition of \u2206F).\nThe (twofold) deleted join of K, denoted by K\u22172\n\u2206 , has vertex set V (K)\u00d7[2] (two copies of\nV (K)) and the simplices are {S1 \u228e S2 : S1 , S2 \u2208 K, S1 \u2229 S2 = \u2205}, where we use the shorthand\nS1 \u228e S2 := (S1 \u00d7{1}) \u222a (S2 \u00d7{2}).\nZ2 -spaces and Z2 -index.\nA Z2 -space (also called antipodality space in the literature)\nis a pair (T, \u03bd), where T is a topological space and \u03bd : T \u2192 T , called the Z2 -action, is a\nhomeomorphism such that \u03bd 2 = \u03bd \u25e6 \u03bd = idT . If (T1 , \u03bd1 ) and (T2 , \u03bd2 ) are Z2 -spaces, a Z2 -map\nbetween them is a continuous mapping f : T1 \u2192 T2 such that f \u25e6 \u03bd1 = \u03bd2 \u25e6 f . The sphere S n\nis considered as a Z2 -space with the antipodal homeomorphism x 7\u2192 \u2212x. Following \u017divaljevi\u0107\n[38], we define the Z2 -index of a Z2 -space (T, \u03bd) by\nind (T, \u03bd) := min {n \u2265 0 : there is a Z2 -map (T, \u03bd) \u2192 S n } \u2208 {0, 1, 2, . . .} \u222a {\u221e}\n(the Z2 -action \u03bd is omitted from the notation if it is clear from context). If ind (T1 , \u03bd1 ) >\nind (T2 , \u03bd2 ), then there is no Z2 -map T1 \u2192 T2 . The Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem can be re-stated\nas ind (S n ) = n.\nA simplicial Z2 -complex is a simplicial complex K with a simplicial map \u03bd of K into itself\nsuch that (the canonical affine extension of) \u03bd is a Z2 -action on kKk. For the deleted join\nK\u22172\n\u2206 , we have the canonical Z2 -action given by \"swapping the two copies of V (K),\" formally\n(v, 1) 7\u2192 (v, 2) and (v, 2) 7\u2192 (v, 1).\nFor any simplicial Z2 -complex K whose Z2 -action is free (that is, has no fixed point), we\nhave\ndim K \u2265 ind K \u2265 1 + Z2 -acyclicity(K) \u2265 1 + connectivity(K).\nHere the first inequality needs freeness (in fact, ind K = \u221e if the Z2 -action has a fixed point).\nThe second inequality is a homological version of the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem; see Walker [35].\nThe parameter connectivity(K) denotes the smallest k such that there exists a continuous\nmap S k+1 \u2192 kKk that is not nullhomotopic, while the acyclicity parameter is defined by\ne i (K, Z2 ) = 0 for all i \u2264 k}.\nZ2 -acyclicity(K) := max{k : H\n\nThe Z2 -acyclicity is of interest in this context, since it is effectively computable, both theoretically [29, \u00a711] and practically (for not too large complexes; see [12]), while the Z2 -index\nand the connectivity are in general harder to determine.\nWe recall that two topological spaces X and Y are homotopy equivalent if there are\ncontinuous maps f : X \u2192 Y and g : Y \u2192 X such that f \u25e6 g is homotopic to idY and g \u25e6 f\nis homotopic to idX . For Z2 -spaces, Z2 -homotopy equivalence is defined analogously, but we\nrequire that f , g, as well as all maps in the two homotopies be Z2 -maps.\n6\n\n\f3\n\nProof methods for Kneser's conjecture\n\nThe box complex B(G). For a graph G and any subset A \u2286 V (G), let\nCN(A) := {v \u2208 V (G) : {a, v} \u2208 E(G) for all a \u2208 A} \u2286 V \\ A\nbe the set of all common neighbors of A.\nWe define the box complex B(G) of a graph G as the simplicial complex with vertex set\nX = V (G)\u00d7[2] (i. e., two disjoint copies of V (G)), with simplices given by\n\b\nB(G) := A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 : A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 \u2286 V (G), A\u2032 \u2229 A\u2032\u2032 = \u2205,\nG[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] is complete, CN(A\u2032 ), CN(A\u2032\u2032 ) 6= \u2205 .\n\n(We recall the notation A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 = (A\u2032 \u00d7{1})\u222a (A\u2032\u2032 \u00d7{2}).) So the simplices of B(G) correspond\nto complete bipartite subgraphs in G. We admit A\u2032 or A\u2032\u2032 empty, but then it is required that\nall vertices of the other shore have a common neighbor (if both A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 are nonempty, the\ncondition CN(A\u2032 ), CN(A\u2032\u2032 ) 6= \u2205 is superfluous).\nHowever, if the extra condition on \"having a common neighbor\" is deleted, then we get a\ndifferent box complex\n\b\nB0 (G) := A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 : A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 \u2286 V (G), A\u2032 \u2229 A\u2032\u2032 = \u2205, G[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] is complete\n\nthat contains B(G), and which will also play a role in the following.\nA canonical simplicial Z2 -action on B(G) is given by interchanging the two copies of V (G);\nthat is, (v, 1) 7\u2192 (v, 2) and (v, 2) 7\u2192 (v, 1), for v \u2208 V (G). This makes B(G) into a Z2 -space.\nIf f : V (G) \u2192 V (G) is a graph homomorphism, we associate to it a map B(f ) : V (B(G)) \u2192\nV (B(H)) in the obvious way: B(f )(v, j) := (f (v), j) for v \u2208 V (G), j \u2208 [2]. It is easily verified\nthat B(f ) is a simplicial Z2 -map of B(G) into B(H). Moreover, the construction respects the\ncomposition of maps, and so B(.) can be regarded as a functor from the category of graphs\nwith homomorphisms into the category of Z2 -spaces with Z2 -maps.\nIt is not hard to show that B(Km ) is Z2 -homotopy equivalent to S m\u22122 , and ind B(Km ) =\nm \u2212 2 (see Section 5). Since an m-coloring of G can be regarded as a homomorphism of G\ninto Km , it induces a Z2 -map of B(G) into S m\u22122 , and we obtain\n\u03c7(G) \u2265 ind B(G) + 2.\n\n(1)\n\nThe box complex B(G) is a variation of ideas from Alon, Frankl, and Lov\u00e1sz [1] and\nK\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20].\nNeighborhood complexes and the Lov\u00e1sz bound. Lov\u00e1sz [22] defined the neighborhood\ncomplex as N(G) := {S \u2286 V (G) : CN(S) 6= \u2205}, and he proved that one always has \u03c7(G) \u2265\n3 + connectivity(N(G)). His proof uses another simplicial complex L(G), which can be defined\nas the order complex of the system of all \"closed sets\" in N(G):\nL(G) := \u2206{A \u2282 V (G) : CN(CN(A)) = A}.\nThus, the vertices of L(G) are shores of inclusion-maximal complete bipartite subgraphs of G.\nUnlike N(G), this L(G) is a simplicial Z2 -complex, with the Z2 -action given by A 7\u2192 CN(A),\nand a slight modification of Lov\u00e1sz' proof actually yields the lower bound\n\u03c7(G) \u2265 ind L(G) + 2.\n7\n\n\fAs shown in [22], L(G) is a strong deformation retract of N(G). A version of Lov\u00e1sz' bound,\nformulated in terms of the classifying map of the Z2 -bundle associated with L(G), was published by Milgram and Zvengrowski [27]. Their formulation can be used as a tool for bounding\nind L(G) from below.\nIn Section 5 we will show that ind L(G) = ind B(G). So while B(G) and L(G) provide\nthe same lower bound, the functoriality of B(.) (which was probably known to experts, but\nas far as we know, hasn't appeared in print) is a significant advantage. Walker [34] shows\nhow a homomorphism induces a Z2 -map for the L(.) complexes, but the construction is more\ncomplicated and not canonical.\nThe subsequent lower bounds are formulated for Kneser graphs, in terms of the defining\nset system F. The next definition is crucial in their formulation. With a set system F, we\nassociate the following simplicial complex K = K(F): The vertex set of K is X, the ground\nset of F, and\nK(F) := {S \u2286 X : F 6\u2286 S for all F \u2208 F}.\nThus F is the family of \"minimal nonfaces\" of K (plus possibly additional nonfaces), while K\nis the complex of \"F-free sets.\"\nThe Sarkaria bound.\nFrom Sarkaria's proof of Kneser's conjecture [31], the following\ngeneral bound can be deduced (F is assumed to have the ground set [n]):\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22172\n\u03c7(KG(F)) \u2265 ind \u2206 (2[n] )\u22172\n\u2206 \\ K\u2206 + 1.\n\nAs it turns out, the complex on the right-hand side is just another version of a box complex\nof KG(F). Sarkaria, in the concrete cases he deals with, then proceeds to estimate the index\nof that complex using an elegant trick with joins (\"Sarkaria's inequality\"; see [38] or [25]),\nwhich in general leads to\n\u03c7(KG(F)) \u2265 n \u2212 1 \u2212 ind K\u22172\n(2)\n\u2206.\nWe call the right-hand side of this inequality the Sarkaria bound. It is not explicitly stated\nin this way in Sarkaria's papers, and so perhaps \"generalized Sarkaria bound\" would be more\nprecise, but repeating the adjective \"generalized\" at every occasion seems annoying.\nB\u00e1r\u00e1ny's proof from [4] yields a lower bound that can generally be phrased as follows.\nSuppose that for some d \u2265 1, the ground set X of F can be placed into the sphere S d in such\na way that for every open hemisphere H there exists a set F \u2208 F with F \u2286 X \u2229 H. Then\n\u03c7(KG(F)) \u2265 d+2. (Kneser's conjecture is obtained from this using Gale's lemma, stating\nthat, for every d, k \u2265 1, one can place 2k+d points on S d so that every open hemisphere\ncontains at least k points.) For the purposes of comparing the bound with the other bounds,\nwe will rephrase it using the Gale transform; see Section 6. The result can be expressed as\nfollows: Suppose that K is a subcomplex of the boundary complex of an (n\u2212d)-dimensional\nconvex polytope P (under a suitable identification of the vertices of K with the vertices of P ).\nThen \u03c7(KG(F)) \u2265 d. We will refer to a number d as in this statement as the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound;\na comment similar to the one for the Sarkaria bound applies here as well.\nFrom this form it is not hard to show that the Sarkaria bound is always at least as strong\nas the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound (but, of course, the index in (2) might be difficult to evaluate).\nThe Dol'nikov\u2013K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e bound is a purely combinatorial lower estimate for \u03c7(KG(F)). For\na set system F, let the 2-colorability defect cd2 (F) (called the width in [20]) be the minimum\n8\n\n\fsize of a subset Y \u2286 X such that the system of the sets of F that contain no points of Y is\n2-colorable. In other words, we want to color each point of X red, blue, or white in such a\nway that no set of F is completely red or completely blue (it may be completely white), and\ncd2 (F) is the minimum number of white points required for such a coloring. The following\nbound was derived by Dol'nikov [10, 11] by a geometric argument from the Borsuk\u2013Ulam\ntheorem, and independently (and as a part of a more general result) by K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20, 21], via\ncertain box complexes:\n\u03c7(KG(F)) \u2265 cd2 (F).\n(3)\n\u0001\n(Since it is easily seen that cd2 ( [n]\nk ) = n \u2212 2k + 2, Kneser's conjecture follows.) A very short\nand elegant geometric reduction to a suitable version of the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem follows\nimmediately from the recent work of Greene [15], which currently provides the shortest selfcontained proof of the Kneser conjecture.\nThe inequality (3) is also an immediate consequence of (2). Indeed, estimating the Z2 index by the dimension, (2) leads to \u03c7(G) \u2265 n \u2212 1 \u2212 dim K\u22172\n\u2206 , and some unwrapping of\ndefinitions reveals that, surprisingly, the latter quantity is exactly cd2 (F).\n\n4\n\nThe hierarchy\n\nIn the following theorem, we summarize and compare all the considered lower bounds for \u03c7(G).\nTheorem 1 (The Hierarchy Theorem). Let G = (V, E) = KG(F) be a finite (Kneser)\ngraph with no isolated vertices, where F \u2286 2[n] , and let K = K(F) = {S \u2286 [n] : F 6\u2286 S\nfor all F \u2208 F}.

Indeed, for every G without a 4-cycle, there is a\ncanonical Z2 -equivariant Z2 -map of sd B(G) to a 1-dimensional subcomplex of B(G),\ngiven by A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 7\u2192 \u2205 \u228e CN(A\u2032 ) for |A\u2032 | \u2265 2, A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 7\u2192 CN(A\u2032\u2032 ) \u228e \u2205 for |A\u2032\u2032 | \u2265 2, and\nA\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 7\u2192 A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 otherwise, and we get ind B(G) \u2264 1.\n(H3) The gap in the inequality (H3) can be at most 1; this can be derived from the inequality\n(M1) of Proposition 4 below, which yields ind B0 (G) \u2265 ind B(G).\n(H6) The B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound can be strictly larger than the Dol'nikov\u2013K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e bound, without any\nbound on the gap, as will be discussed at the end of Section 6 for the example of the\nSchrijver graphs. Thus, in particular, the gap in (H3) can be arbitrarily large.\nThe B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound depends on the choice of the polytope P . At present we do not know\nwhether P can always be chosen of dimension at most dim K\u22172\n\u2206 + 1, that is, whether\nthe B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound can always be made at least as strong as the Dol'nikov\u2013K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e bound.\nOn the other hand, we do not have an example where the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound is necessarily\nsmaller than the Sarkaria bound.\nRemarks on size/computability.\nAlthough the Dol'nikov-K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e \"colorability defect\"\nbound is attractive since it is combinatorial, in general the Lov\u00e1sz bound may be much\ntighter. However, the number of vertices of L(G) may be exponential in n = |V (G)|, and\nsimilarly for some of the other box complexes. On the other hand, B(G) has only 2n vertices.\nThe number of simplices can still be exponential, but if, for example, the maximum degree\nof G is bounded by a constant, then there are at most polynomially many simplices. Perhaps\na computation of the Z2 -acyclicity of B(G), which provides a lower bound for ind B(G) (and\nthus for \u03c7(G)), might be feasible in some cases.\n\n5\n\nBox complexes and neighborhood complexes\n\nIn the following definition, we collect six (natural) variants of box complexes, four defined for\na graph and two for a Kneser representation of it. For completeness, we also include the box\ncomplexes B(G) and B0 (G) that were already defined above.\nDefinition 2 (Box complexes). Let G = (V, E) = KG(F) be a finite (Kneser) graph with\nno isolated vertices, and suppose that the ground set of F is [n]. The first two complexes are\non the vertex set V \u00d7[2]; they were already defined in Section 3.\n1. The box complex B(G) is\n\b\nB(G) := A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 : A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 \u2286 V, A\u2032 \u2229 A\u2032\u2032 = \u2205,\n\nG[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] is complete, CN(A\u2032 ), CN(A\u2032\u2032 ) 6= \u2205 .\n\b\nEquivalently, but more concisely, we can also write B(G) = A\u2032 \u228eA\u2032\u2032 : A\u2032 \u2286 CN(A\u2032\u2032 ) 6= \u2205,\nA\u2032\u2032 \u2286 CN(A\u2032 ) 6= \u2205 .\n\n2. A simpler definition, but a larger complex, is obtained as\n\b\nB0 (G) := A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 : A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 \u2286 V, A\u2032 \u2229 A\u2032\u2032 = \u2205, G[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] is complete .\n\nThis is almost as for B(G), but here if one shore is empty, the other can be anything.\n10\n\n\f3. The following definition of a box complex, from K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20, p. 568], takes into account\nonly the complete bipartite graphs with both shores A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 nonempty:\n\b\nBchain (G) := \u2206 A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 : \u2205 =\n6 A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 \u2282 V,\nA\u2032 \u2229 A\u2032\u2032 = \u2205, G[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] is complete .\n\nHere the vertices are the vertex sets of complete bipartite subgraphs of G, and the\nsimplices are chains of such sets under inclusion.\n4. The vertices of the next box complex, from Alon, Frankl & Lov\u00e1sz [1, p. 361], are\ndirected edges of G; that is, ordered pairs (u, v) with {u, v} \u2208 E. We let\n\b\n~ \u2286 A\u2032 \u00d7A\u2032\u2032 : \u2205 =\nBedge (G) := F\n6 A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 \u2282 V, A\u2032 \u2229 A\u2032\u2032 = \u2205, G[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ] is complete .\nThat is, simplices are subsets of edge sets of complete bipartite subgraphs of G, where\nthe edges are oriented from the first shore to the second shore.\n\u0001\n\u22172\n5. The simplicial complex \u2206 (2[n] )\u22172\n\u2206 \\K\u2206 appearing in Theorem 1, used as an intermediate\nstep by Sarkaria in the derivation of his lower bounds, can be more explicitly written as\n\b \u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nBKG\nSark (F) := \u2206 B \u228e B : B , B \u2286 [n], B \u2229 B = \u2205,\nat least one of B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 contains a set of F .\n\nThe vertex set are pairs of disjoint subsets of the ground set of F that support a complete\nbipartite subgraph of the Kneser graph, with at least one shore nonempty.\n6. Finally, another Kneser box complex, as in K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20, p. 574], is\n\b \u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nBKG\nchain (F) := \u2206 B \u228e B : B , B \u2286 [n], B \u2229 B = \u2205,\n\nboth B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 contain a set of F .\n\nOn each of these types of box complexes, we have the natural Z2 -action that interchanges\nthe shores of the bipartite subgraph.\nAs we will show, all these box complexes fall into two groups, and those in each group\nhave the same Z2 -index. Moreover, the Lov\u00e1sz complex L(G) can also be included in one of\nthe groups.\nTheorem 3. The following holds for the Z2 -indices of the various box complexes:\nind Bchain (G) = ind BKG\nchain (F) = ind Bedge (G) = ind B(G) = ind L(G)\n\u2264 ind B0 (G) = ind BKG\nSark (F) \u2264 ind Bchain (G) + 1.\nFor a proof of this theorem, the following proposition provides explicit simplicial Z2 -maps\namong the various box complexes. Here susp K denotes the suspension of a simplicial complex\nK (a \"double cone\" over K): susp K := K \u222a {S \u222a {s} : S \u2208 K} \u222a {S \u222a {n} : S \u2208 K}, where s\nand n are two new vertices not belonging to V (K). The last inequality of the theorem follows\nfrom the map (M4) in the proposition, together with ind susp K \u2264 ind K + 1 and the fact that\nsusp S n is an S n+1 .\n\n11\n\n\fProposition 4 (Z2 -maps). For every finite graph G = KG(F) without isolated vertices,\nthere are canonical simplicial Z2 -maps\nB(G)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nB0 (G),\n\n(M1)\n\nsd Bedge (G) \u2190\u2192 Bchain (G),\n\n(M2)\n\nBchain (G)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nsd B(G),\n\n(M3)\n\nsd B0 (G)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nsusp Bchain (G),\n\n(M4)\n(M5)\n\nsd B0 (G) \u2190\u2192\n\nBKG\nchain (F),\nBKG\nSark (F),\n\nsd sd B(G)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nBchain (G),\n\n(M7)\n\nsd L(G)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nBchain (G),\n\n(M8)\n\nsd Bchain (G)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nsd L(G).\n\n(M9)\n\nBchain (G) \u2190\u2192\n\n(M6)\n\nAnswering a question by the first author, Lov\u00e1sz (personal communication, February\n2000) proved that L(G) is homotopy equivalent to Bchain (G) (using the nerve theorem); our\nconstruction of the Z2 -map in (M9) is inspired by his proof.\nAfter a preliminary version of this paper was written, Csorba [8] proved that B0 (G) is\nZ2 -homotopy equivalent to susp (B(G)) for every G, thereby considerably strengthening our\nstatements above concerning these box complexes.\nThe following figure sketches the three main box complexes for G = C5 and suggests the\nmaps between them. Here B(C5 ) is homeomorphic to S 1 \u00d7 I; it is a subcomplex of B0 (C5 ),\nwhich additionally contains two simplices on 5 vertices. The complex Bchain (C5 ), an S 1 on 10\nvertices, embeds into the barycentric subdivision of B(C5 ):\n\n1\u2032\n\n5\u2032\u2032\n4\u2032\n\n3\n\n\u2032\n\n3\u2032\u2032\n2\u2032\n1\u2032\u2032\n\n5\u2032\nBchain (C5 )\n\n\u0592\u2192\n\nB(C5 )\n\n\u0592\u2192\n\nB0 (C5 )\n\nProof.\n(M1) This map is simply the identity on the vertex set: an inclusion map.\n(M2) The map sd Bedge (G) \u2192 Bchain (G) is defined on the vertices of sd Bedge (G) by setting\n~ ) collects the tails, and t(F~ ) collects the heads, of the\nF~ 7\u2192 h(F~ ) \u228e t(F~ ), where h(F\n~\ndirected edges in F .\nThe map Bchain (G) \u2192 sd Bedge (G) in the other direction is obtained by sending A\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032\nto the (directed) edge set of the complete bipartite graph with shores A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 .\n(M3) The map Bchain (G) \u2192 sd B(G) is simply an inclusion, as each vertex of Bchain (G) is also\na simplex of B(G).\n12\n\n\f(M4) The map sd B0 (G) \u2192 susp Bchain (G) is obtained by mapping the \"improper\" complete\nbipartite subgraphs (with one shore empty) to the suspension points.\n(M5) A canonical Z2 -map BKG\nchain (F) \u2192 Bchain (G) is defined on the vertices by\nB \u2032 \u228e B \u2032\u2032 7\u2212\u2192 {F \u2032 \u2208 F : F \u2032 \u2286 B \u2032 } \u228e {F \u2032\u2032 \u2208 F : F \u2032\u2032 \u2286 B \u2032\u2032 }.\nA canonical Z2 -map Bchain (G) \u2192 BKG\nchain (F) is obtained by mapping the vertices:\nS \u2032\u0001\nS \u2032\u2032 \u0001\nA\u2032 \u228e A\u2032\u2032 7\u2212\u2192\nA \u228e\nA .\n\n(M6) The same formulas define Z2 -maps BKG\nSark (F) \u2190\u2192 sd B0 (KG(F)).\n\n(M7) The map sd sd B(G) \u2192 Bchain (G) is defined on the second barycentric subdivision of\nB(G), and so its vertices are chains of the form\n\u0001\nA = A\u20320 \u228e A\u2032\u20320 \u2282 * * * \u2282 * * * \u2282 A\u2032k \u228e A\u2032\u2032k .\n\nWe let \u03bc\u2032 (A) be the smallest nonempty set in the chain of sets A\u2032 := (A\u20320 \u2282 * * * \u2282\nA\u2032k \u2286 CN(A\u2032\u2032k ) \u2286 * * * \u2286 CN(A\u2032\u20320 )), and similarly for \u03bc\u2032\u2032 (A) (here we use the condition\nCN(A\u2032 ), CN(A\u2032\u2032 ) 6= \u2205 from the definition of B(G)). We let the image of A be \u03bc\u2032 (A) \u228e\n\u03bc\u2032\u2032 (A). This is a vertex of Bchain (G): Since the first barycentric subdivision does not\ncontain \u2205 as a vertex, at least one of A\u20320 , A\u2032\u20320 , say A\u20320 , is nonempty. Then we have\n\u03bc\u2032 (A) = A\u20320 , while \u03bc\u2032\u2032 (A) is contained in CN(A\u2032\u20320 ). If we extend the chain A, then this\nalso leads to an extension of the chains A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 , so the sets \u03bc\u2032 (A) and \u03bc\u2032\u2032 (A) can\nonly get smaller. Therefore, our map is simplicial, and it is clearly a Z2 -map.\n\n(M8) We recall that the vertices of L(G) are the nonempty subsets A \u2282 V that are closed in\nthe sense that A = CN(CN(A)), or equivalently, A = CN(B) for some nonempty subset\nB \u2282V.\nFirst we define a Z2 -map f : sd L(G) \u2192 Bchain (G). A vertex of sd L(G) is a chain\nA = (A0 \u2282 A1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Ak ) of nonempty closed sets. We set f (A) := A0 \u228e CN(Ak ).\nSince CN(Ak ) \u2286 CN(A0 ), the image is indeed a vertex of Bchain (G). If a chain A\u2032\nextends A, its first set can only be smaller than the first set of A, and the last set can\nonly be larger than the last set of A. Therefore, f (A\u2032 ) \u2286 f (A), and it follows that\nf is simplicial. Finally, the image of A under the Z2 -action on sd L(G) is the chain\nB = (CN(Ak ) \u2282 CN(Ak\u22121 ) \u2282 * * * \u2282 CN(A0 )). We have f (A) = A0 \u228e CN(Ak ) and\nf (B) = CN(Ak ) \u228e CN2 (A0 ) = CN(Ak ) \u228e A0 (as A0 is closed), and so f is a Z2 -map.\n(M9) Finally, we provide a Z2 -map sd Bchain (G) \u0001\u2192 sd L(G). A vertex in sd Bchain (G) is\na chain A = A\u20320 \u228e A\u2032\u20320 \u2282 * * * \u2282 A\u2032k \u228e A\u2032\u2032k . All the sets CN2 (A\u20320 ),. . . , CN2 (A\u2032k ),\nCN(A\u2032\u20320 ),. . . , CN(A\u2032\u2032k ) are closed and nonempty, and the following inclusion are easily verified: CN2 (A\u20320 ) \u2286 * * * \u2286 CN2 (A\u2032k ) \u2286 CN(A\u2032\u2032k ) \u2286 * * * \u2286 CN(A\u2032\u20320 ). So by omitting\nrepeated sets from this chain, we obtain a vertex of sd L(G). The chain A is mapped\nto this vertex. If we extend A, the image stays the same or is extended as well, so the\nmap is simplicial. Finally, it is a Z2 -map; here we use that CN3 = CN.\n2\n\n13\n\n\fThe above definitions by far do not exhaust the list of possible (and possibly interesting)\nbox complex variants. For example,\nalso define the \"Kneser counterparts\" of B(G)\n\b we could\n\u2032 \u228e B \u2032\u2032 : B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 \u2286 [n], B \u2032 \u2229 B \u2032\u2032 = \u2205, both B \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032\nand B0 (G), namely BKG (F) := S \u2286\nB\n\b\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\ncontain a set of F and BKG\n0 (F) := S \u2286 B \u228e B : B , B \u2286 [n], B \u2229 B = \u2205, at least one of\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nB , B contains a set of F . By similar arguments as in the proof of Proposition 4, it can be\nKG (F), but we prefer to\nshown that ind B0 (KG(F)) = ind BKG\n0 (F) and ind B(KG(F)) = ind B\nomit this part.\nIn some of the cases in Proposition 4, the maps even provide Z2 -homotopy equivalences\nbetween the respective complexes. Since the proofs are not very interesting and, at present,\nthe Z2 -homotopy types do not seem to bring anything new concerning the lower bounds for\nthe chromatic number, we have decided not to discuss this in the present paper.\nThe box complexes of complete graphs. In order to use a box complex for bounding\nthe chromatic number of a graph, we need to know the Z2 -index of the box complex of Km . In\nview of the equalities of indices established above for the various box complexes, we mention\nonly two of the box complexes here (but the others can also be analyzed directly without\ndifficulty).\nProposition 5. The polyhedron of the simplicial complex B0 (Km ) is (homeomorphic to) an\nS m\u22121 , and thus ind B0 (Km ) = m\u22121.\nThe polyhedron of the simplicial complex B(Km ) is homeomorphic to S m\u22122 \u00d7[0, 1], and\nthus ind B(Km ) = m \u2212 2.\nProof. B0 (Km ) is isomorphic to the boundary complex of an m-dimensional cross polytope\n(\"generalized octahedron,\" or unit ball of the l1 -norm), with its canonical antipodal Z2 -action.\nThe complex B(Km ) is isomorphic to the boundary complex of an m-dimensional cross\npolytope with two opposite facets removed, and with its canonical antipodal Z2 -action.\n2\nBy now, all parts of Theorem 1 have been proved, except for the claims involving the\nB\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound.\n\n6\n\nThe B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound\n\nProof of the inequality (H6). We need to prove that if the simplicial complex K is a part of\nthe boundary of an k-dimensional convex polytope P , then ind K\u22172\n\u2206 \u2264 k\u22121. Briefly speaking,\nthe reason is that the deleted join of S k\u22121 contains kK\u22172\nk\nand\nis\nZ2 -homotopy equivalent to\n\u2206\nk\u22121\nS\n. A more detailed argument follows.\nLet us recall that if X and Y are topological spaces, the join X \u2217 Y is the quotient of the\nproduct space X\u00d7Y \u00d7[0, 1] by the equivalence \u2248, where (x, y, 0) \u2248 (x\u2032 , y, 0) and (x, y, 1) \u2248\n(x, y \u2032 , 1) for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 X and y, y \u2032 \u2208 Y . If K is a simplicial complex and K\u22172 := {S \u228e S \u2032 :\nS, S \u2032 \u2208 K}, then there is a (canonical) homeomorphism kKk\u22172 \u223c\n= kK\u22172 k.\nHere we need the space\n\u0001\nZ := S k\u22121 \u2217 S k\u22121 \\ {(x, x, 21 ) : x \u2208 S k\u22121 };\n\nthis is a kind of deleted join of S k\u22121 (considered as a topological space, not a simplicial\ncomplex). The space Z is equipped with the Z2 action given by (x, y, t) 7\u2192 (y, x, 1\u2212t).\nUsing the canonical homeomorphism kK\u22172 k \u2192 kKk\u22172 and a homeomorphism of the boundary of P with S k\u22121 , we obtain a Z2 -map h : kK\u22172 k \u2192 S k\u22121 \u2217 S k\u22121 . Moreover, if we restrict\n14\n\n\f1\nthe left-hand side to kK\u22172\n\u2206 k, then the image contains no point of the form (x, x, 2 ), and so h\nk\u22121 be represented as\nis a Z2 -map kK\u22172\n\u2206 k \u2192 Z. So it suffices to show that ind Z \u2264 k\u22121. Let S\nk\nk\u22121\nthe unit sphere in R . We define a Z2 -map Z \u2192 S\nby\n\n(x, y, t) 7\u2192\n\ntx \u2212 (1\u2212t)y\n.\nktx \u2212 (1\u2212t)yk\n\nIf tx \u2212 (1\u2212t)y = 0 for unit vectors x, y, then t = 12 and x = y. Thus, the map is well defined,\nand one can also check that it is continuous. Clearly, it commutes with the respective Z2 actions. This concludes the proof.\n2\nAn extension of B\u00e1r\u00e1ny's proof. Here we directly prove the inequality \u03c7(KG(F)) \u2265 d\nwhenever K(F) is a part of the boundary of an (n\u2212d)-dimensional simplicial convex polytope.\nThis explains the relation of this bound to B\u00e1r\u00e1ny's [4] original proof of the Kneser conjecture.\nLet V = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vn ) \u2282 Rn\u2212d be the vertex set of P , and let V \u2217 = (v1\u2217 , v2\u2217 , . . . , vn\u2217 ) \u2282\nd\u22121\nR\nbe a Gale diagram of V (see, e. g., [36, Lect. 6] for an introduction to Gale diagrams).\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that all points in V \u2217 different from 0 lie in S d\u22122 . We\nrecall that the points of V , and thus also the points of V \u2217 , are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the elements of the ground set of F.\nWe want to show that every open hemisphere in this S d\u22122 contains a set corresponding to\na set of F. Once this is done, we can proceed exactly as in B\u00e1r\u00e1ny's proof. Namely, supposing\nthat the sets of F have been colored by at most d\u22121 colors, we define the set Ai \u2286 S d\u22122 as the\nset of all x \u2208 S d\u22122 such that the open hemisphere centered at x contains at least one set of F\ncolored by i, i \u2208 [d\u22121]. Each Ai is open, and by the above claim, the Ai together cover all of\nS d\u22122 . By a suitable version of the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem (called the Lyusternik\u2013Shnirel'man\ntheorem), there exist x \u2208 S d\u22122 and i \u2208 [d\u22121] such that x, \u2212x \u2208 Ai . This means that two\nopposite open hemispheres both contain a set of color i, and so the coloring is not a proper\ncoloring of the Kneser graph.\nTo prove the claim, consider an open hemisphere H, and let S \u2217 := H \u2229 V \u2217 . Since H is\ndefined by an open halfspace, there is a linear functional on Rd\u22121 that is positive on S \u2217 and\nnonpositive on V \u2217 \\ S \u2217 . Let S \u2282 V be the set corresponding to S \u2217 . Properties of the Gale\ndiagram imply that there is an affine dependence of the points of V in which the points of S\nhave positive coefficients and the other points have nonpositive coefficients. This means that\nconv(S) \u2229 conv(V \\ S) 6= \u2205. So S is not the vertex set of a face of P , and thus S 6\u2208 K(F).\nThis means that S contains a set of F. The proof is finished.\n2\n\u0001\nOn Schrijver graphs and the Dol'nikov\u2013K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e bound. Let 0 < 2k < n, and let [n]\nk stab\ndenote the system of all sets F \u2286 [n] such that if i \u2208 F then i+1 6\u2208 F , and if n \u2208 F then 1 6\u2208 F .\n\u0001\n(So the sets of [n]\nk stab can be identified with the independent sets in the cycle of length n,\nwith the numbering of vertices from 1 to n along the cycle.) Schrijver [32] proved that the\n\u0001 \u0001\n[n]\u0001\u0001\ngraph SGn,k := KG [n]\n.\nk stab is a vertex-critical subgraph of the Kneser graph KG\nk\nThat is, \u03c7(SGn,k ) = n \u2212 2k + 2, and every proper induced subgraph of SGn,k has a smaller\nchromatic number. The criticality follows by a clever coloring construction and we will not\nconsider it here; we look at a proof of the lower bound.\nIt turns out that the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound applies very neatly here. Let P := C2k\u22122 (n) be a\ncyclic polytope of dimension 2k \u2212 2 on n vertices. With the usual numbering of the vertices,\nGale's evenness criterion (see [36, Thm. 0.7]) shows that the S \u2286 [n] that contain no set of\n\n15\n\n\f[n]\u0001\nk stab\n\n\u0001 \u0001\nare exactly the proper faces of P . Therefore, K [n]\nk stab = \u2202P , and the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny\nbound immediately yields \u03c7(SGn,k ) \u2265 n \u2212 2k + 2.\nThe Schrijver graphs also provide examples where the Dol'nikov\u2013K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e bound\n\u0001 is consider[n]\u0001\nably weaker than the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny bound. Indeed, it is easy to check that cd2 k stab = n\u22124k+4.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\n1. Many of the above considerations can easily be extended to Kneser hypergraphs (where\nvertices are again the sets of F, and edges are r-tuples of pairwise disjoint sets, for some\ngiven r), and even to the s-disjoint Kneser hypergraph version of Sarkaria, as in Ziegler\n[37]. A detailed exploration of this is a subject for further research.\nIndeed, the p-partite versions of some of our box complexes as presented in Section 5\nappear in the published literature that concerns Kneser hypergraphs: The p-partite version of Bedge (G) is used in Alon, Frankl & Lov\u00e1sz [1, p. 361]. The p-partite version of\nBchain (G) appears in K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20, p. 568], while in K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [20, p. 574] we find the p-partite\nversion of BKG\nchain (G). The box complexes appear in K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e' work as \"resolution complexes\"\nfor equivariant cohomology.\n2. In a discussion with Jarik Ne\u0161et\u0159il, we noted the following interpretation of B0 (G) (and\nB(G)): the simplices of B0 (G) are vertex sets of complete bipartite subgraphs in G \u00d7\nK2 , where the \"categorical product\" of graphs G \u00d7 H has vertex set V (G) \u00d7 V (H) and\nedges {(u, v), (u\u2032 , v \u2032 )} such that {u, u\u2032 } \u2208 E(G) and {v, v \u2032 } \u2208 E(H). The Z2 -action is\nthen induced by the exchange of vertices of K2 . A homomorphism G \u2192 G\u2032 induces a\nhomomorphism G \u00d7 K2 \u2192 G\u2032 \u00d7 K2 (so the B(*) functor \"factors\" in this way). This can\nbe generalized, for example, to a product G \u00d7 Cp , where Cp is the p-cycle with the natural\nZp -action (cyclic shift).\n3. In a similar spirit but earlier, Lov\u00e1sz and others have considered a setting of \"Homcomplexes\": For this let H and G be finite graphs, and let \u2206G be a simplex with vertex\nset V (G). The Cartesian power (\u2206G )|V (H)| is a polyhedral complex, whose vertices can\nbe identified with mappings V (H) \u2192 V (G). Then Hom(H, G) is the subcomplex induced\nby the vertices that are homomorphisms (thus, the faces are all polyhedra F \u2208 (\u2206G )|V (H)|\nsuch that each vertex of F is a homomorphism). This rather general setting covers Lov\u00e1sz'\nconnectivity lower bound, as well as some of the recent work of Brightwell and Winkler [7].\nLov\u00e1sz conjectured that if Hom(C2r+1 , G) is k-connected then \u03c7(G) \u2265 k + 4. Here r \u2265\n1 is an arbitrary integer and C2r+1 denotes the odd cycle of length 2r + 1. This was\nrecently proved by Babson and Kozlov [3] by advanced topological methods. Let us remark\nthat while \u03c7(G) \u2265 k + 3 is easy to establish by methods discussed in the present paper,\nthe improvement by 1 currently seems hard, and it represents new kind of topological\nobstruction to (k + 4)-colorability, which apparently is not captured by any of the lower\nbounds discussed above.\n4. The inequality ind susp K \u2264 ind K may be strict for finite simplicial complexes K: For\nexample, one may obtain a cell complex model by taking h : S 3 \u2192 S 2 to be the Hopf\nmap, and attaching two 4-cells to S 2 via 2h resp. \u22122h, where multiples of maps are taken\naccording to addition in \u03c03 (S 2 ) \u223c\n= Z. (This particular example was suggested by P\u00e9ter\n\n16\n\n\fCsorba, based on an earlier construction by Csorba, \u017divaljevi\u0107, and the first author for a\ndifferent purpose; another approach was proposed by Wojchiech Chach\u00f3lski.)\nHowever, it is not clear whether ind susp K = ind K occurs in the rather special setting\nof (H3), where K is a box complex. An interesting step in this direction was recently taken\nby Csorba (private communication), who proved that given any simplicial Z2 -complex K,\nthere is a graph G such that N(G) is homotopy equivalent to K. At present it is not clear\nwhether this result can be extended to a Z2 -homotopy equivalence of the box complex of a\nsuitable graph with a given K; if yes, this would provide many pathological examples and,\nin particular, it would answer the above question.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Imre B\u00e1r\u00e1ny, Anders Bj\u00f6rner, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz, and Jaroslav Ne\u0161et\u0159il\nfor most valuable conversations and comments.
