PASS is a continuous photometric survey of the entire celestial sphere with a high temporal resolution. Its major objectives\nare the detection of all giant-planet tran sits (with periods up to some weeks) across stars up to mag 10.5,\nand to deliver continuously photometry that is useful for the study of any variable stars. The prototype\nis based on CCD cameras with short focal length optics on a fixed mount. A s mall dome to house it\nat Teide Observatory, Tenerife, is currently being constructed. A placement at the antarctic Dome C is\nalso being considered. The prototype will be used for a feasibility study of PASS, to define the best observing strategies, and to perform a detailed characterization of the capabilities and scope of the survey.\nAfterwards, a first partial sky surveying will be started with it. That first survey may be able to detect\ntran siting planets during its first few hundred hours of operation. It will also deliver a data set around\nwhich software modules dealing with the various scientific objectives of PASS will be developed. The\nPASS project is still in its early phase and teams interested in specific scientific objectives, in providing\ntechnical expertise, or in participating with own observations are invited to collaborate.\nSubject headings: instrumentation: photometers - planetary systems - stars: variables: general - surveys -\ntechniques: photometric\n\n1. PASS - The Permanent All Sky Survey\n\nnity. The basic instrument design consists of several\narrays of fixed CCD cameras with short (about 50mm)\nfocal length, which will simultaneously survey the entire sky that is visible from their observing location.\nThese cameras will continuously take short exposures\nin which the stars will appear as short trac es. A more\ndetailed presentation of the objectives and design of\nPASS is forthcoming (Deeg et al. (2004)).\n\nThe Permanent All Sky Survey is intended to perform a continuous photometric survey of the entire celestial sphere with a high temporal resolution. Its major objectives are the detection of all giant-planet transits (with periods up to some weeks) across stars up\nto mag 10.5, and the acquisition of photometry that\nis useful for the study of any variable stars, reaching\nsomewhat fainter magnitudes (depending on the precision required). About 250 000 stars are expected to\nbe surveyed by PASS , with the goal to obtain their\nlight-curves with the upmost continuity on time-scales\nof minutes, and to link these curves into the databases\nthat are commonly used by the astronomical commu-\n\n2. PASS0 - A prototype for a feasibility study\nWhile the basic design of PASS is very simple, it\nis nevertheless a project that requires a complex and\npotent data reduction pipeline, and the installation of a\nconsiderable number of CCD cameras in several loca-\n\n1\n\n\fFig. 1.- The prototype of PASS at 'first light', 17\nJanuary 2004.\n\nFig. 2.- Trace-shaped apertures on which photometry\nis performed. They are shown over an image from the\nprototype with 60 sec exposure time. Shorter exposure\ntimes, about 15-20 seconds, are expected to constitute\nthe 'baseline' in future observations.\n\ntions. Also, there is little experience in the photometric analysis of unguided images, and in the analysis\nof stellar images taken with optics of very short focal\nlengths. A study to demonstrate the feasibility of this\ninstrument design is therefore being undertaken. This\nstudy started with theor etical signal-to-noise calculations and the creation of artificial images. A photometric reduction of these images showed that aperturephotometry on trace-shaped stellar images is able to\nextract light-curves close to the calculated S/N (Deeg\net al. (2004)). It was also shown, that confusion due\nto stellar density affects only a small fraction of stars\nat galactic latitudes of \u2248 10\u25e6 . As a next step, a prototype with one CCD camera has been set up on several occasions since January 2004 at Teide Observatory in Tenerife (Fig. 1). Funding has been obtained\ntowards the purchase of a further CCD camera, and the\nconstruction of a small dome is in progress. The current prototype consists of two Apogee AP10 cameras\nwith a 2k \u00d7 2k front-illuminated Th7899 CCD detector, and Nikon Nikkor F-series lenses with f =50mm\nand maximum apertures of f/1,2, giving each a field\nof view of 30\u25e6 \u00d7 30\u25e6 . The cameras are mounted on\na heavy-duty tripod-heads (Manfrotto 229) with scales\nfor altitude, azimuth and rotation. A small GPS receiver with USB port (Laipac G10U) will synchronize\nthe control computer in time. Observations with the\nprototype are aimed at these objectives, in rough temporal order:\n\nmid airmasses, no moon, average stellar crowding, mid-latitude declination).\n\u2022 Define a set of optimum instrumental and operational parameters (exposure time, best lensapertures or 'f-stop', possibly evaluating different optics and CCD cameras).\n\u2022 Characterize capabilities and scope of PASS\n('detection space') in baseline situation.\n\u2022 Characterize capabilities in different situations,\nfrom observations under different conditions.\n\u2022 Starting a first survey in a limited field (see Section 4.).\nWhile first sequences of images have been taken\nwith the prototype in temporary set-ups, a fixed setup is required for any observations that will indicate\nthe precision that may be achieved with PASS. In the\nobservations foreseen, the camera will be set up in a\nsemi-permanent fashion, and be pointed into the same\ndirection for weeks without disturbance. Such stability is a fundamental requirement for the success of\nPASS, as unguided images will be taken every night\nat the same set of sidereal times (ST). Thus, in images taken at different nights, but at the same ST, the\nstars will be moving over exactly the same CCD pixels.\n\n\u2022 Evaluate if main objectives can be achieved in a\n'baseline' situation (good observing site, low to\n2\n\n\fThis feature will allow the cancellation of any flatfielding errors, be they from the optics or from the CCD.\nLight-curves will then be derived from a comparison\nof a star against its neighbors, and across sequences\nof images from many nights taken at identical ST's. A\nphotometric reduction based partially on modules used\nin the SuperWASP (Street et al. (2003)) experiment\nis currently under development. This pipeline performs aperture photometry within trace-shaped apertures such as shown in Fig. ??. Any valid evaluation\nof the precision that can be obtained by the prototype\nrequires however images that were taken in several\nnights at the same sidereal time, which is pending on\nthe completion of a dome for PASS.\n3. Dome C as a potential placement\nFor a southern station of PASS, a placement at the\nantarctic Dome C may be an appealing alternative over\na site at mid-southern latitudes (e.g. Chile, Australia).\nThe major virtues of that site result from the extremely\nlow seeing values that have been re ported. One may\nexpect that scintillation noise will be at least 3-4 times\nlower than from a very good normal observing site. A\nfurther advantage comes from the long observing coverage that can be obtained in a single season. Assuming that useful data can be obtained for stars with altitudes as low as 15\u25e6 above the horizon, all stars south\nof -30\u25e6 will be circumpolar at Dome C (-75\u25e6S) and can\nbe observed permanently. For them, observations in a\nsingle winter-season at Dome C will corresp ond to 34 s of observations at a mid-latitude site (where they\naren't circumpolar). The major technical difficulties\nare of course caused by the extreme cold, as temperatures below -80C in winter have been reported. The\nsmall size and simple structure o f PASS may however\nallow a relatively easy and economic adaptation. The\nonly moving part \u2013 the shutter of the CCD cameras\n\u2013 would become unnecessary with the employment of\nCCD detectors that use interline technology. These are\nsimilar to those used in video-cameras, and large format grey-scale chips up to 24 x 36mm size are being\noffered with the 'KAI' series by Kodak. Their disadvantage is a lower quantum efficiency. Astronomical\ncameras with such detectors are currently arriving on\nthe market, and th e purchase of one is being evaluated.\nAn alternative would be the enclosure of the prototype\nin an isolated box with an optical window, which is\nheated to more moderate temperatures around -20C.\n\nFig. 3.- The field of view of the two-camera prototype system for a partial sky-surveying. It is drawn\ninto an orthographical projection of the sky with celestial coordinates for declination and hour angle, for\na location at 28.5\u25e6 N (Tenerife). T he two overlapping\nsquares indicate the 28\u25e6 \u00d7 28\u25e6 views of the cameras,\nwhich range from declinations of 45\u25e6 to over 70\u25e6 . The\ntwo dashed concentric rings indicate airmasses of 1.2\n(inner one) and 1.5 (outer one).\n4. PASS1 - A first stage of the PASS survey\nAfter the termination of prototype observations,\nmainly aimed at evaluating the instrument under varying conditions, the start of the PASS survey in a limited\nfield is planned. This should lead to the first scientifically useful data, and allows to gain o bservational\nexperience. Also, some parameters affecting performance may only be evaluated from data that are obtained over a longer term, such as dependencies on seeing, temperature, and the effects caused by precession\nor nutation. That data set will al so be important in\ndeveloping and testing the reduction pipeline and calibration procedures. Furthermore, it will be the starting\npoint in the development of procedures for the scientific interpretation of the data, where the development\nof modules for ea ch scientific objective is foreseen.\nThe pointing that is foreseen for a 2-camera system is\ntowards the celestial meridian at mid-northern declina-\n\n3\n\n\f5. Participating in PASS\nIt should be noted that the PASS project is still in its\nearly phase and we expect that it provides the opportunity to cover a wide range of topics and objectives. Its\ninitiators welcome any expression of interest that may\nlead to participation in this pr oject. We also want to\nstress, that the modular and extensible nature of PASS,\nwith several camera arrays in various locations, will allow a relatively simple adding of observational equipment by collaborating teams.\nThis project is partially being funded by grant AyA\n2002-04566 of the spanish national science plan. We\nalso thank the SuperWASP team for the loan of an\nAP10 CCD camera, which allowed an early start of\nthis project.\n\nFig. 4.- Yearly and nightly coverage that is obtained\nby the 2-camera prototype, in dependence of declination. Nightly coverage is length of time a star need to\npass across the field of view. Yearly coverage gives the\nhours that star at a given declina tion can be observed\nduring one year. Variations tied to right ascension,\nwhich arise from varying lengths of nights in summer\nand winter, are ignored here.\n\nREFERENCES\nDeeg, H., Alonso, R., Belmonte, J., Alsubai, K.,Horne,\nK. & Doyle, L. 2004, PASP, in print\nStreet, R.

This pointing is a compromise between\nmoderate airmasses (best at zenith) and a go od nightly\ncoverage of stars (best near celestial pole), adapted to\na mid-latitude site like Tenerife (28.5\u25e6N). The yearly\ncoverage of a star at a given declination may be derived\nfrom the equation:\nTcov = (HAmax \u2212 HAmin )/24 * Tnight ,\nwere Tcov is the yearly observational coverage,\nHAmax and HAmin delimit the hour-angle that is coverered (by a fixed instrument), and Tnight is the total\nyearly night time. Assuming a conservative t otal of\n1500 hrs of useful night-hours per year, Tcov may be\nexpected to be in the range of 300-500 hours (Fig. 4),\nwhereas 300 - 400 hours of observations may be considered a minimum to detect short-periodic planetary transit c andidates with some reliability (Deeg et\nal. (2004)). The prototype may therefore be expected\nto find first transits after 1-2 seasons of observations.\nWhen a reduction pipeline has been put in place, further cameras may be added at this or other si tes at\nany later date, allowing thereby a gradual start of the\nPermanent All Sky Survey.\n\nThis 2-column preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX macros\nv5.2.\n\n4\n\n\f"}
