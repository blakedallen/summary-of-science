Introduction\nRecent discoveries of non-oxide superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4] with respectably\nhigh transition temperatures, Tc , and pairing mechanisms more complex than an\nisotropic, single-band, phonon-mediated one, have revitalised interest in intermetallic\nsuperconductors and promoted detailed studies of relatively simple binary and ternary\nmaterials, in particularly those containing alkaline earths or light elements, that did not\nget enough attention in the past due to complex synthesis, air sensitivity, or were just\noverlooked.\nThe existence of binary SrSn4 phase was suggested about 30 years ago [5] but only\nrecently [6] the crystal structure was solved and superconductivity (Tc = 4.8 K) was\ndiscovered. Thus SrSn4 is the most recent addition to the alkaline earth - stannides\ngroup of superconductors (for SrSn3 , BaSn3 and BaSn5 the superconducting transition\ntemperatures are \u2248 5.4 K [7], \u2248 2.4 K [8], and \u2248 4.4 K [9], respectively). SrSn4\ncrystallizes in the orthorhombic structure (Cmcm space group) with a unique Sr site\nand three different Sn sites. Of the physical properties, only low temperature and low\nfield magnetization measured on a polycrystalline sample were reported so far [6].\nIn this work we report growth of single crystals of SrSn4 and measurements of\ntheir thermodynamic and transport properties. Both the superconducting and normal\nstates were characterized. The relevant results are compared with the band structure\ncalculations.\n2. Methods\nSingle crystals of SrSn4 were produced by traditional solution-growth methods.[10, 11]\nElemental Sr and Sn were placed in a 2 ml alumina crucible (with the ratio of 3.5:\n96.5). A second, catch crucible, containing silica wool was placed on the top of the\ngrowth crucible and sealed in a silica ampoule under approximately 1/3 atmosphere of\nargon gas. It should be noted that the packing and assembly of the growth ampoule was\nperformed in a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere. The sealed ampoule was heated up\nto 800\u25e6 C over several hours, then cooled to 370\u25e6 C , and slowly cooled to 260\u25e6 C over 36\nh. At this temperature, the crucible was removed from the furnace and the remaining\nliquid was decanted. The crystals grow as elongated blades or rods of a few mm length\nand sub-mm the two other dimensions. The crystals are air-sensitive, and have to be\nkept in the nitrogen glovebox. An effort was made to minimize the exposure to air in\nthe process of handling and shaping the samples for the thermodynamic and transport\nmeasurements.\nPowder x-ray diffraction data on both non-oxidized and oxidized sample were\ncollected by a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at room\ntemperature. The diffraction pattern of the non-oxidized SrSn4 was taken from the\npowder of SrSn4 single crystals that were ground in a glovebox. The sample powder\nwas sealed by Kapton film during the measurement to protect it from oxidization. The\n\n\fPhysical properties of SrSn4\n\n3\n\nsame powder was used for the oxidized x-ray diffraction after a seven-hour exposure to\nthe air.\nTemperature- and magnetic field - dependent dc magnetization was measured using\na Quantum Design MPMS-5 SQUID magnetometer. Electrical resistance was measured\nin a Quantum Design PPMS instrument using a conventional four-probe geometry.\nPlatinum wires were attached to the sample using EpoTek H20E silver epoxy with the\ncurrent flowing approximately along the longest dimension of the crystal (a-axis). The\nepoxy was cured in air at 120\u25e6 C for \u223c 20 min. This procedure resulted in some surface\noxidation, but seems to preserve the structural integrity and electrical current continuity\nfor the resistance samples. Heat capacity was measured in a PPMS instrument using\na relaxation technique. Low field dc magnetization under pressure up to \u223c 10 kbar\nwas measured in MPMS-5 using a commercial, HMD, Be-Cu piston-cylinder pressure\ncell [12] with Daphne oil 7373 as a pressure medium and superconducting Pb as a low\ntemperature pressure gauge [13].\n3. Results and Discussion\nPowder x-ray diffraction (Fig. 1) on the non-oxidized sample confirms that the\nsynthesized crystals are SrSn4 with Cmcm structure. The obtained lattice parameters\nare a = 4.625(2) \u00c5, b = 17.384(6) \u00c5 and c = 7.077(3) \u00c5, consistent with the literature\ndata [6]. A few lines from residual Sn flux are also visible. In contrast, the diffraction\npeaks of SrSn4 all disappear in the oxidized sample's diffraction pattern, leaving only\nSn peaks, with their intensities remaining basically unchanged (Fig. 1). These results\nimply that the oxidation of the powdered SrSn4 results in the phase that is too small\nor disordered to diffract.\nTemperature dependent resistivity data for SrSn4 are presented in Fig. 2. Since\nthe sample was of somewhat irregular shape, the data are presented normalized to\nthe room temperature value. The room temperature resistivity, to within factor of\ntwo, is approximately 200 \u03bc\u03a9 cm. The resistivity data show metallic (d\u03c1/dT > 0)\nbehavior with rather high residual resistivity ratio, RRR = \u03c1(300 K)/\u03c1(5 K) \u223c 70. The\nsuperconducting transition, with an onset at \u223c 4.9 K, is clearly seen in the data.\nAnisotropic temperature-dependent dc susceptibility, M/H, is shown in Fig. 3.\nNormal state, high field susceptibility, is paramagnetic and anisotropic, with (M/H)ac >\n(M/H)b in the whole temperature range. Anisotropic M(H) measured at 5 K is close\nto linear, possibly with small para- or ferromagnetic contribution that saturates by \u223c 5\nkOe at \u223c 2 10\u22124 \u03bcB /f.u. value. The temperature dependence of the susceptibility is\nsomewhat surprising. The high temperature part of the anisotropic M/H(T ) in principle\ncan be fitted with a modified Curie - Weiss law, \u03c7 = \u03c70 + C/(T \u2212\u0398), (resulting in rather\nlarge, 0.7 \u2212 0.9\u03bcB , effective moment and large, negative, order of -200 K, values of \u0398).\nAt this point we have doubts that such local-moment-like picture has any merit. More\nwork is required to determine if this temperature dependence is intrinsic and what is\nthe mechanism behind it.\n\n\fPhysical properties of SrSn4\n\n4\n\nSuperconductivity with the onset of \u223c 4.8 K is clearly seen in the low field zerofield-cooled (ZFC) susceptibility data, Figs. 4 and 5, (no corrections for demagnetization\nfactor were employed). To infer an anisotropic upper superconducting critical field for\nSrSn4 , a set of low field ZFC susceptibility measurements were performed (see Figs. 4,5).\nA criterion of M = 0 was chosen for the upper critical field. Alternatively, anisotropic\nHc2 (T ) can be evaluated from the shifts of resistively measured superconducting\ntransitions in different applied magnetic fields (Fig. 6). Onset and offset criteria are\nused for the resistivity data (Fig. 6(a)). The resulting anisotropic Hc2 (T ) curves are\nshown in Fig. 7. As it often the case, Tof f set criterion agrees quite well with Tonset\ncriterion for magnetization. Albeit different measurements and criteria give somewhat\ndifferent Hc2 (T ) curves, several features are observed in all of them. A distinct upward\ncurvature is clearly seen for both orientations (this upturn is particularly sharp in onset\nresistivity data). This feature might be a signature of multiband superconductivity\n[14]. The upper critical field of SrSn4 is rather small, clearly below 10 kOe at T = 0.\nThe anisotropy of Hc2 is rather small, it does not exceed \u223c 1.5. Hc2 (T ) curves from\nmagnetization and offset resistive data are similar. Taken together these data suggest\nthat this material might have complex superconductivity and/or superconducting H \u2212T\nphase diagram. It has to be noticed that Tc and the superconducting critical fields found\nfor SrSn4 in this work are significantly different from that for elemental Sn used as flux\n(Tc (Sn) \u2248 3.7 K, and Hc (Sn, T = 0) = 305 Oe), which rules out traces of Sn flux in the\ncrystals as the source of the superconducting behavior [15].\nThe low temperature heat capacity of SrSn4 is shown in Fig. 8. A 10 kOe applied\nfield is enough to completely suppress superconductivity (Fig. 7) without changing the\nnormal state properties. From the low temperature, in-field, heat capacity data, the\nSommerfeld coefficient for SrSn4 is estimated to be \u03b3 \u2248 9.7 mJ/mol K2 , and the Debye\ntemperature \u0398 \u2248 170 K. The superconducting transition is clearly seen in zero-field heat\ncapacity data. The jump at Tc is \u2206Cp /Tc \u2248 20.8 mJ/mol K2 that gives corresponds to\n\u2206Cp /\u03b3Tc \u2248 2.1 This value is higher than the canonical 1.43 value expected for isotropic\nweakly coupled BCS superconductor and suggests that SrSn4 is a strongly coupled\nsuperconductor [16]. Finally, the Cp (T ) behavior in the superconducting state (Fig.\n8, lower right inset) appears to be non-exponential and reasonably well described by\nCp \u221d T 3 function. If intrinsic, such dependence might point to deviations from isotropic\nsingle band superconductivity for this material.\nThe superconducting transition temperature of SrSn4 linearly decreases under pressure up to \u223c 8 kbar (Fig. 9). The pressure derivative dTc /dP = \u22120.068 \u00b1 0.007 K/kbar,\nis rather small, similar in sign and order of magnitude to those measured for a number\nof elemental and binary superconductors [17]. Such pressure dependence is possibly the\nresult of rather weak dependence of the density of states on energy near the Fermi level\nas well as possibly opposing changes to Tc caused by shift in the phonon spectrum by\nhydrostatic pressure.\nThe electronic structure calculation has been done within generalized gradient\n\n\fPhysical properties of SrSn4\n\n5\n\napproximations of density functional theory using the quantum espresso package\n[18].We have employed plane-wave basis set and ultrasoft pseudo-potential [19] and\nthe Perdew, Wang [20] exchange-correlation functional. The Brillouin zone (BZ)\nsummations were carried out over a 16x16x8 BZ grid with Gaussian boarding 0.02\nRy in self-consistent calculation and summation over tetrahedrons for electronic density\nof states calculation. The plane wave energy cut off at 30 Ry allows an accuracy of 0.2\nmRy/atom. The calculated density of states (DOS) is presented in Fig. 10. Similar to\nthe results published in [6, 21], the Fermi level (EF ) is located near the edge of a local\nmaximum and close to local minimum. However the local minimum is less pronounced\ncompared to LMTO results [6, 21]. The value of DOS at EF (\u2248 5 St/eV cell) is pretty\nhigh and the corresponding \u03b3band \u2248 5.8 mJ/mol K2 . Comparison with the experimental\nvalue, \u03b3exp = (1 + \u03bb)\u03b3band , yields the value of the enhancement factor (due to electron\n- electron and electron - phonon interactions) \u03bb \u2248 0.7, that appears to be comparable\nto the enhancement observed in alkali metals due to electron - phonon interactions [22]\nThe almost equal distribution of total DOS between all atoms in the compound points\nto strong hybridization of valence electrons (that might contribute to the value of \u03bb).\nThe detailed analysis of character of electrons bonds have been provided in [6].\nAccording to the calculations, a Fermi surface (FS) of SrSn4 is formed by multiple\nsheets formed by four bands (Fig. 11). The FS topology is complex: bands 4 and 7 give\ncontribution in form of a number of rather small, distorted, ellipsoids, whereas bands 5\nand 6 contribute to the FS in the form of multiply-connected \"monsters\". There appears\nto be no dominating low-dimensional, cylindrical, FS parts. The small Hc2 anisotropy\nis consistent with this three-dimensional FS. Similarly, no profound anisotropy in the\nelectrical transport is expected.\n4. Summary\nDetailed thermodynamic and transport measurements were performed on single crystals\nof SrSn4 with RRR \u223c 70. The normal state magnetic susceptibility is paramagnetic and\nslightly anisotropic. SrSn4 can be characterized as strongly-coupled three dimensional\nsuperconductor with Tc \u2248 4.8 K, and the upper critical field of the order of 2 kOe.\nThe anisotropy of Hc2 does not exceed 1.5 and is slightly temperature-dependent. Tc\ndecreases slowly under hydrostatic pressure up to \u223c 10 kbar. The heat capacity and\nHc2 (T ) data suggest that superconductivity in this material may be more complex\nthan isotropic BCS. Band structure calculations of the DOS at EF are consistent\nwith experimental observations, suggesting the strong hybridization of valence electrons\nand yielding three-dimensional Fermi surface with multiple sheets originating from four\nbands.\nSince SrSn4 crystals have high RRR and easily accessible Tc , detailed studies of the\nsymmetry of the superconducting state by low temperature thermal transport and/or\npenetration depth measurements could be of interest.\n\n\fPhysical properties of SrSn4\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was carried out at the Iowa State University and supported by the AFOSRMURI grant #FA9550-09-1-0603 (X.
