Under the natural action of the\nstabilizer group G(L4 ) < GL(8, 2) the 255 points of PG(7, 2) fall into four\norbits \u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 , \u03c94 , of respective lengths 12, 54, 108, 81. We show that the\n135 points \u2208 \u03c92 \u222a \u03c94 are the internal points of a hyperbolic quadric H77\ndetermined by L4 , and that the 81-set \u03c94 (which is shown to have a sextic\nequation) is an orbit of a normal subgroup G81 \u223c\n= (Z3 )4 of G(L4 ). There\n3\n\u223c\nare 40 subgroups = (Z3 ) of G81 , and each such subgroup H < G81 gives\nrise to a decomposition of \u03c94 into a triplet {RH , R\u2032H , R\u2032\u2032H } of 27-sets. We\nshow in particular that the constituents of precisely 8 of these 40 triplets\nare Segre varieties S3 (2) in PG(7, 2). This ties in with the recent finding\nthat each S = S3 (2) in PG(7, 2) determines a distinguished Z3 subgroup\nof GL(8, 2) which generates two sibling copies S \u2032 , S \u2032\u2032 of S.\n\nMSC2010: 51E20, 05B25, 15A69\nKey words: Segre variety S3 (2); line-spread; invariant polynomials\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe work for most of the time over F2 = GF(2), and so we can then identify\na projective point hxi \u2208 PG(n \u2212 1, 2) with the nonzero vector x \u2208 V (n, 2). In\nfact we will be dealing with vector space dimension n = 8, and we will start out\nfrom a(ny) direct sum decomposition\nV8 = Va \u2295 Vb \u2295 Vc \u2295 Vd\n\n(1)\n\nof V8 := V (8, 2) into 2-dimensional spaces Va , Vb , Vc , Vd . For h \u2208 {a, b, c, d} we\nwill write\nVh = {uh (\u2205), uh (0), uh (1), uh (2)},\n\nwith uh (\u2205) = 0.\n\n(The reason for this labelling of the four element of Vh is that in a later section\nwe wish to use 0, 1, 2 as the elements of the Galois field F3 .) So PV8 = PG(7, 2)\nis the span of the four projective lines\nLh := PVh = {uh (0), uh (1), uh (2)}, h \u2208 {a, b, c, d}.\n\n(2)\n\nIt is surprising, but gratifying, that from such a simple starting point so many\ninteresting and intricate geometrical aspects quickly emerge, as we now describe.\n1\n\n\f1.1\n\nH7 -tetrads of lines in PG(7, 2)\n\nFor vh \u2208 Vh let (va , vb , vc , vd ) := va \u2295 vb \u2295 vc \u2295 vd denote a general element of\nV8 . Setting Uijkl := (ua (i), ub (j), uc (k), ud (l)) then the 255 points of PG(7, 2)\nare\n{Uijkl | i, j, k, l \u2208 {\u2205, 0, 1, 2}, ijkl 6= \u2205\u2205\u2205\u2205}.\n(3)\nFirst observe that the subgroup G(L4 ) of GL(8, 2) which preserves the direct\nsum decomposition (1), and hence the foregoing tetrad\nL4 := {La , Lb , Lc , Ld }\n\n(4)\n\nof lines, has the semi-direct product structure\nG(L4 ) = N \u22ca Sym(4),\n\nwhere N := GL(Va ) \u00d7 GL(Vb ) \u00d7 GL(Vc ) \u00d7 GL(Vd ),\n\nand where Sym(4) = Sym({a, b, c, d}). Hence |G(L4 )| = 64 \u00d7 24 = 31, 104.\nThe G(L4 )-orbits of points are easily determined. In addition to the weight\nwt(p) = wtB (p) of a point p \u2208 PG(7, 2) with respect to a basis B for V8 , let us\nalso define its line-weight lw(p) as follows:\nlw(Uijkl ) = r\n\nwhenever precisely r of i, j, k, l are in {0, 1, 2}.\n\nThen the 255 points of PG(7, 2) clearly fall into just four G(L4 )-orbits \u03c91 , \u03c92 ,\n\u03c93 , \u03c94 , where\n\u03c9r = {p \u2208 PG(7, 2)| lw(p) = r}.\n(5)\nThe lengths of these orbits are accordingly\n\u0001\n|\u03c91 | = 12, |\u03c92 | = 42 \u00d7 32 = 54, |\u03c93 | =\n\n4\n3\n\n\u0001\n\n\u00d7 33 = 108,\n\n|\u03c94 | = 34 = 81.\n\nNext take note that there is a unique Sp(8, 2)-geometry on V8 := V (8, 2),\ngiven by a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form B, such that the subspaces\nVa , Vb , Vc , Vd are hyperbolic 2-dimensional spaces which are pairwise orthogonal.\nIf B = {ei }i\u2208{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} is any basis such that\nV8 = Va \u22a5 Vb \u22a5 Vc \u22a5 Vd = \u227ae1 , e8 \u227b \u22a5 \u227ae2 , e7 \u227b \u22a5 \u227ae3 , e6 \u227b \u22a5 \u227ae4 , e5 \u227b\n\n(6)\n\nthen the symplectic product x * y := B(x, y) is determined by its values on basis\nvectors:\ne1 * e8 = e2 * e7 = e3 * e6 = e4 * e5 = 1,\nei * ej = 0 for other values of i, j,\n\n(7)\n\nand so has the coordinate expression\nx * y = (x1 y8 + x8 y1 ) + (x2 y7 + x7 y2 ) + (x3 y6 + x6 y3 ) + (x4 y5 + x5 y4 ).\nPerhaps less obvious is the fact that the tetrad (4) also determines a particular non-degenerate quadric Q in PG(7, 2). For, as we now show, such a quadric\nQ is uniquely determined by the two conditions\n2\n\n\f(i) it has equation Q(x) = 0 such that the quadratic form Q polarizes to give\nthe foregoing symplectic form B : Q(x + y) + Q(x) + Q(y) = x * y;\n(ii) the 12-set of points\nP(L4 ) := \u03c91 = La \u222a Lb \u222a Lc \u222a Ld \u2282 PG(7, 2)\nsupporting the tetrad L4 is external to Q.\nFor it follows from (i) that the terms of degree 2 in Q must be P2 (x) =\nx1 x8 + x2 x7 + x3 x6 + x4 x5 , and then the eight conditions Q(ei ) = 1 entail that\nP8\nthe linear terms in Q must be P1 (x) = i=1 xi , so that\nQ(x) = P2 (x) + P1 (x) = x1 x8 + x2 x7 + x3 x6 + x4 x5 + u * x,\n(8)\nP8\nwhere u := i=1 ei . Further Q in (8) is seen to satisfy also the four conditions\nQ(ei + ej ) = 1, ij \u2208 {18, 27, 36, 45}, so indeed Q(p) = 1 for all p \u2208 \u03c91 .\nTheorem 1. The quadric Q is a hyperbolic quadric H7 ; moreover H7 = \u03c92 \u222a\u03c94 .\nProof. There exist just two kinds, E7 and H7 , of non-degenerate quadrics in\nPG(7, 2). An elliptic quadric E7 has 119 points and a hyperbolic quadric H7\nhas 135 points; see [7, Theorem 5.21], [9, Section 2.2]. Since Q is uniquely\ndetermined, its internal points must be a union of the G(L4 )-orbits \u03c92 , \u03c93 , \u03c94 ,\nof respective lengths 54, 108, 81. So the only possibility is that Q is a hyperbolic\nquadric H7 = \u03c92 \u222a \u03c94 , having 54 + 81 = 135 points. (So we will term such a\ntetrad L4 of lines in PG(7, 2) a H7 -tetrad.)\nCorollary 2. G(L4 ) is a subgroup of the isometry group G(Q) \u223c\n= O+ (8, 2) <\nSp(8, 2) of the hyperbolic quadric H7 .\nRemark 3. In fact G(L4 ) is a maximal subgroup of O+ (8, 2) = O+\n8 (2) * 2; see\n[3, p. 85], where it is recorded as S3 wr S4 .\n\n1.2\n\nG(L4 )-invariant polynomials\n\nThe tetrad L4 = {La , Lb , Lc , Ld } determines the following G(L4 )-invariant sets\nof flats in PG(7, 2) :\n(i) four 5-flats: hLa , Lb , Lc i, hLa , Lb , Ld i, hLa , Lc , Ld i, hLb , Lc , Ld i;\n(ii) six 3-flats: hLa , Lb i, hLa , Lc i, hLa , Ld i, hLb , Lc i, hLb , Ld i, hLc , Ld i;\n(iii) four 1-flats: La , Lb , Lc , Ld .\nLet (i) Fhkl = 0 be the quadratic equation of the 5-flat hLh , Lk , Ll i, (ii) Fhk = 0\nbe the quartic equation of the 3-flat hLh , Lk i and (iii) Fh = 0 be the sextic\nequation of the line Lh . (See [11, Lemma 2].) Consequently the tetrad L4\ndetermines the G(L4 )-invariant polynomials Q2 , Q4 , Q6 , of respective degrees\n2, 4, 6, defined as follows:\n(i) Q2 = Fabc + Fabd + Facd + Fbcd ,\n(ii) Q4 = Fab + Fac + Fad + Fbc + Fbd + Fcd ,\n(iii) Q6 = Fa + Fb + Fc + Fd .\n3\n\n\fTheorem 4. The 81-set \u03c94 has the sextic equation Q\u03c94 (x) = 0, where Q\u03c94 :=\nQ6 + Q4 + Q2 .\nProof. Setting \u03c8Q := {p \u2208 PG(7, 2)| Q(p) = 0}, the last entry in the following\ntable follows from the three preceding entries.\nQ\nQ2\nQ4\nQ6\nQ2 + Q4 + Q6\n\ndeg Q\n2\n4\n6\n6\n\n\u03c91\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nQ(p)\n\u03c92\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nif p \u2208\n\u03c93 \u03c94\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\u03c8Q\n\u03c92 \u222a \u03c94\n\u03c93 \u222a \u03c94\n\u03c92 \u222a \u03c93 \u222a \u03c94\n\u03c94\n\n|\u03c8Q |\n135\n189\n243\n81\n\nRemark 5. Of course Q2 = 0 is, see Eq. (8), the H7 quadric Q of Theorem 1.\nAlso Q4 was denoted Q\u20324 in [11, Theorem 17] and Q6 was denoted Q\u20326 in [11,\nExample 20]. The sextic terms in Q6 are readily found, since\nQ6 = \u03a0i6=1,8 (1 + xi ) + \u03a0i6=2,7 (1 + xi ) + \u03a0i6=3,6 (1 + xi ) + \u03a0i6=4,5 (1 + xi ).\nConsequently, in terms of the sextic monomials x[\nxi , we see that\nj xk := \u03a0i\u2208{j,k}\n/\nQ6 = x[\n[\n[\n[\n1 x8 + x\n2 x7 + x\n3 x6 + x\n4 x5 + (terms of degree < 6).\n\n(9)\n\nRemark 6. A sextic polynomial Q determines, via complete polarization, an\nalternating multilinear form \u00d76 V8 \u2192 F2 , and hence an element b \u2208 \u22276 V8\u2217 \u223c\n=\n\u22272 V8 . (See [10, Section 1.1].) Since Q6 is G(L4 )-invariant, and since there is\na unique nonzero G(L4 )-invariant element of \u22272 V8\u2217 \u223c\n= Alt(\u00d72 V8 , F2 ), namely B\nin Eq. (7), it follows, in the case Q = Q6 , that b must be the \u22272 V8 image of\nB \u2208 \u22272 V8\u2217 , namely\nb = e1 \u2227 e8 + e2 \u2227 e7 + e3 \u2227 e6 + e4 \u2227 e5 .\n\n(10)\n\nIt follows from (10) that the sextic terms in Q6 must be the four monomials\nin (9). So the result (9) could in fact have been deduced in this alternative\nmanner.\nFrom the foregoing it is not too difficult to find by hand the explicit coordinate form of the sextic polynomial Q\u03c94 . In fact we used Magma, see [2], to\nobtain the result below. At times writing 1\u2032 = 8, 2\u2032 = 7, 3\u2032 = 6, 4\u2032 = 5, let us\n\n4\n\n\fdefine the following polynomials:\nP\nP\nP\nP1 = 1\u2264i\u22648 xi , P2 = 1\u2264i<j\u22648 xi xj , P3 = 1\u2264i<j<k\u22648 xi xj xk ,\nP\nP4 = 1\u2264k<l\u22644 xk xk\u2032 xl xl\u2032 ,\nX\nX\nP4\u2032 =\nxk xl ,\nxm xm\u2032 Pmm\u2032 , where Pmm\u2032 =\n1\u2264m\u22644\n\nk<l, l6=k\u2032\n\u2032\nk,l\u2208{m,m\n/\n}\n\nX\n\nP5 =\n\nxk xk\u2032 xl xl\u2032 xm ,\n\n1\u2264k<l\u22644\n\u2032\nm\u2208{k,k\n/\n,l,l\u2032 }\n\nP6 =\n\nP\n\n1\u2264k<l<m\u22644 xk xk\n\n\u2032\n\nxl xl\u2032 xm xm\u2032 = x[\n[\n[\n[\n1 x8 + x\n2 x7 + x\n3 x6 + x\n4 x5 .\n\nThen, assisted by Magma, we found that\nQ\u03c94 = P6 + P5 + P4 + P4\u2032 + P3 + P2 + P1 .\n\n2\n\nThe eight distinguished spreads {Lijk\n85 }i,j,k\u2208{1,2}\n\nNext we show that the partial spread L4 of four lines determines a privileged\nset of eight extensions to a complete spread L85 of 85 lines in PG(7, 2). To this\nend, for each h \u2208 {a, b, c, d} let us choose that element \u03b6h \u2208 GL(Vh ) of order\n3 which effects the cyclic permutation (uh (0)uh (1)uh (2)) of the points of Lh .\nConsider the eight Z3 -subgroups {Zijk }i,j,k\u2208{1,2} of G(L4 ) defined by\nZijk = hAijk i,\n\nwhere Aijk := (\u03b6a )i \u2295 (\u03b6b )j \u2295 (\u03b6c )k \u2295 \u03b6d .\n\n(11)\n\nWhen working using the basis B we will make the following choices for the four\n\u03b6h in (11):\n\u03b6a : e1 7\u2192 e8 7\u2192 e1 + e8 ,\n\n\u03b6b : e7 7\u2192 e2 7\u2192 e2 + e7 ,\n\n\u03b6c : e3 7\u2192 e6 7\u2192 e3 + e6 ,\n\n\u03b6d : e5 7\u2192 e4 7\u2192 e4 + e5 .\n\n(12)\n\nWe will also choose the uh (0) so that U0000 is the unit point u of the basis B.\nSince (Aijk )2 + Aijk + I = 0, each Zijk acts fixed-point-free on PG(7, 2) and\ngives rise to a spread Lijk\n85 of lines in PG(7, 2), with a point p \u2208 PG(7, 2) lying\non the line\nLijk (p) := {p, Aijk p, (Aijk )2 p} \u2208 Lijk\n(13)\n85 .\nNote that if in (11) one or more of the \u03b6h is replaced by the identity element\nIh \u2208 GL(Vh ) then, although a Z3 -subgroup of G(L4 ) which preserves the lines\nis generated, it is not fixed-point-free on PG(7, 2). So there exist precisely eight\nextensions of L4 to a Desarguesian spread of 85 lines in PG(7, 2). Observe that\nP8\nin the case where p is the unit vector u := i=1 ei of the basis B then the eight\nlines (13) are distinct: for, using ijkl as shorthand for ei + ej + ek + el , they are\n\n5\n\n\fexplicitly\nL111 (u) = {u, 1357, 2468}, L122 (u) = {u, 1256, 3478},\nL212 (u) = {u, 5678, 1234}, L221 (u) = {u, 2358, 1467},\nL222 (u) = {u, 2568, 1347}, L211 (u) = {u, 3578, 1246},\nL121 (u) = {u, 1235, 4678}, L112 (u) = {u, 1567, 2348}.\n\n(14)\n\nLemma 7. For p \u2208 PG(7, 2) the eight lines Lijk (p) are distinct if and only if\np \u2208 \u03c94 .\nProof. We have in (14) just seen that the eight lines are distinct for the point\nu \u2208 \u03c94 , and hence for all p \u2208 \u03c94 . Consider a point p = (0, vb , vc , vd ) of line-weight\n3. Since A1jk p = A2jk p, and so L1jk (p) = L2jk (p), the lines Lijk (p) coincide in\npairs. Similarly for other points p \u2208 \u03c93 . For a point p \u2208 \u03c92 of line-weight 2 the\nanalogous reasoning shows that only two of the lines Lijk (p) are distinct. And\nof course if p \u2208 \u03c91 , that is if p \u2208 Lh for some h \u2208 {a, b, c, d}, then Lijk (p) = Lh\nfor all eight values of ijk.\nRecall that on a H7 quadric there exist two systems of generators, see [8,\nSection 22.4], elements of either system being solids (3-flats). Consequently it\nfollows from the next theorem that the foregoing eight Z3 -subgroups of G(L4 )\ndivide naturally into two sets of size four, namely Z and Z \u2217 where\nZ \u2217 = {Z222 , Z211 , Z121 , Z112 }.\n\nZ = {Z111 , Z122 , Z212 , Z221 },\n\n(15)\n\nTheorem 8. For p \u2208 \u03c94 let \u03a0(p) denote the flat spanned by the four lines\nLijk (p), ijk \u2208 {111, 122, 212, 221}, and let \u03a0\u2217 (p) denote the flat spanned by\nthe four lines Lijk (p), ijk \u2208 {222, 211, 121, 112}. Then \u03a0(p) and \u03a0\u2217 (p) are\ngenerators of H7 which moreover belong to different systems.\nProof. The flat \u03a0(p) = hL111 (p), L122 (p), L212 (p), L221 (p)i for the point p =\n(va , vb , vc , vd ) \u2208 \u03c94 is seen, upon using (\u03b6h )2 + \u03b6h = Ih , to consist of the nine\npoints L111 (p) \u222a L122 (p) \u222a L212 (p) \u222a L221 (p) of line-weight 4 together with the\nfollowing six points of line-weight 2:\n(va , vb , 0, 0), (va , 0, vc , 0), (va , 0, 0, vd ),\n(0, 0, vc , vd ), (0, vb , 0, vd ), (0, vb , vc , 0).\n\n(16)\n\nBy Theorem 1, for each p \u2208 \u03c94 , the flat \u03a0(p) is in fact a solid on the quadric\nH7 . Similarly the same applies to the flat \u03a0\u2217 (p), whose six points of line-weight\n2 moreover coincide with those of \u03a0(p). So \u03a0(p) \u2229 \u03a0\u2217 (p) is the isotropic plane\nconsisting of p = (va , vb , vc , vd ) together with the six points (16). Consequently,\nsee [8, Theorem 22.4.12, Corollary], for each p \u2208 \u03c94 the generators \u03a0(p) and\n\u03a0\u2217 (p) belong to different systems.\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nThe normal subgroup G81 of G(L4 )\n\nLet Zh denote that Z3 subgroup of G(L4 ) which fixes pointwise each of the three\nlines L4 \\ Lh , h \u2208 {a, b, c, d}. Then clearly the elementary abelian group\nG81 := Za \u00d7 Zb \u00d7 Zc \u00d7 Zd \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3\nis a normal subgroup of N = GL(Va ) \u00d7 GL(Vb ) \u00d7 GL(Vc ) \u00d7 GL(Vd ) and also\nof G(L4 ) = N \u22ca Sym(4). Observe that \u03c94 is a single G81 -orbit. One easily sees\nthat G81 is equally well the direct product Z111 \u00d7 Z122 \u00d7 Z212 \u00d7 Z221 of the four\nmembers of Z, and also the direct product Z222 \u00d7 Z211 \u00d7 Z121 \u00d7 Z112 of the four\nmembers of Z \u2217 .\nConsider now any Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 subgroup H < G81 . If G81 = H \u222a H \u2032 \u222a H \u2032\u2032\ndenotes the decomposition of G81 into the cosets of H then we define subsets\nR := RH , R\u2032 := R\u2032H , R\u2032\u2032 := R\u2032\u2032H of \u03c94 by\nR = {hu, h \u2208 H}, R\u2032 = {h\u2032 u, h\u2032 \u2208 H \u2032 }, R\u2032\u2032 = {h\u2032\u2032 u, h\u2032\u2032 \u2208 H \u2032\u2032 }.\n\n(17)\n\nIn particular R = RH is the orbit of u under the action of the group H. Each\nsuch subgroup H < G81 gives rise to a decomposition \u03c94 = R \u222a R\u2032 \u222aR\u2032\u2032 of \u03c94\ninto a triplet of 27-sets.\nAs we will now demonstrate, the study of such triplets is greatly simplified\nby viewing G81 in a GF(3) light.\n\n3.1\n\nA GF(3) view of G81\n\nFor i, j, k, l \u2208 F3 = GF(3) = {0, 1, 2} define\nAijkl := (\u03b6a )i \u2295 (\u03b6b )j \u2295 (\u03b6c )k \u2295 (\u03b6d )l .\nNote that if i, j, k \u2208 {1, 2} then Aijk1 = Aijk , as previously defined in (11). In\nthe following we will view ijkl as shorthand for the element (i, j, k, l) \u2208 (F3 )4 .\nSince\nA\u03c3 A\u03c4 = A\u03c3+\u03c4 , \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 (F3 )4 ,\n(18)\nobserve that A : \u03c3 7\u2192 A\u03c3 , \u03c3 \u2208 (F3 )4 , is an isomorphism mapping the additive\ngroup (F3 )4 onto the multiplicative group G81 . Now the orbit of any point p \u2208 \u03c94\nunder the action of the\nP8group G81 is the whole of \u03c94 . In particular this is so for\nthe unit point u := i=1 ei of the basis B. Consequently the 81-set \u03c94 is in\nbijective correspondence with (F3 )4 as given by the map \u03b8u : (F3 )4 \u2192 \u03c94 defined\nby\n\u03b8u (\u03c3) = p\u03c3 := A\u03c3 u, \u03c3 \u2208 (F3 )4 .\n(19)\nObserve that the choices made in (2) and (12) imply that \u03b8u (ijkl) = Uijkl for\nall ijkl \u2208 (F3 )4 .\nIn the GF(3) space V (4, 3) = (F3 )4 we will chiefly employ the basis B\u03b5 :=\n{\u03b51 , \u03b52 , \u03b53 , \u03b54 }, where\n\u03b51 = 1000, \u03b52 = 0100, \u03b53 = 0010, \u03b54 = 0001,\n7\n\n(20)\n\n\fP4\nand then write a general element \u03be = r=1 \u03ber \u03b5r \u2208 V (4, 3) as \u03be = \u03be1 \u03be2 \u03be3 \u03be4 . We\ndenote the weight of \u03be \u2208 (F3 )4 in the basis B\u03b5 by wt\u03b5 (\u03be).\nLet us now study subgroups of G81 by viewing them in the light of their\ncorresponding subspaces in the vector space V (4, 3) = (F3 )4 .\nA Z3 subgroup of G81 is of the form {I, A\u03c3 , A2\u03c3 } for some non-zero \u03c3 \u2208\nV (4, 3). So G81 contains 40 subgroups \u223c\n= Z3 which are in bijective correspondence\nwith the 40 points of the projective space PG(3, 3) = PV (4, 3). If we denote by\n\u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 the following eight elements of (F3 )4 :\n\u039e:\n\n\u03b1 = 1111, \u03b2 = 1221, \u03b3 = 2121, \u03b4 = 2211,\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b1\u2217 = 2221, \u03b2 \u2217 = 2111, \u03b3 \u2217 = 1211, \u03b4 \u2217 = 1121,\n\n\u039e :\n\n(21)\n\nthen observe that A\u03b1 , A\u03b2 , . . . , A\u03b4\u2217 are the respective generators of the eight\nZ3 -subgroups Z111 , Z122 , . . . , Z112 \u2208 Z \u222a Z \u2217 considered in (15). Now under\nthe action by conjugacy of G(L4 ) on G81 the particular 4-set {Za , Zb , Zc , Zd } =\n{hA\u03b51 i, hA\u03b52 i, hA\u03b53 i, hA\u03b54 i} of Z3 subgroups is fixed, whence\nT\u03b5 := {h\u03b51 i, h\u03b52 i, h\u03b53 i, h\u03b54 i}\nis a G(L4 )-distinguished tetrahedron of reference in PG(3, 3). Consequently take\nnote that the eight Z3 subgroups {hA\u03c1 i}\u03c1\u2208\u039e\u222a\u039e\u2217 considered in (15) are picked out\nas the only Z3 subgroups hA\u03c1 i of G81 for which wt\u03b5 (\u03c1) = 4.\nNext let us consider subgroups H \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 of G81 .\nTheorem 9. The normal subgroup G81 < G(L4 ) contains precisely 40 subgroups\nH\u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 . These fall into four conjugacy classes C0 , C1 , C2 , C3 of G(L4 ),\nof respective sizes 8, 16, 12, 4.\nProof. Each subgroup hA\u03c1 , A\u03c3 , A\u03c4 i \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 arises as\n{A\u03bb | \u03bb \u2208 V3 := \u227a\u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c4 \u227b}\nfrom a corresponding projective plane PV3 = hh\u03c1i, h\u03c3i, h\u03c4 ii in PG(3, 3). Now\nthere exist precisely 40 planes in PG(3, 3), and these fall into four kinds P0 , P1 ,\nP2 , P3 , where Pr denotes those planes in PG(3, 3) which contain precisely r of\nthe vertices h\u03b5i i of the tetrahedron of reference T\u03b5 . There are 8 planes of kind\nP0 , namely those with one of the 8 equations\n\u03be4 = c1 \u03be1 + c2 \u03be2 + c3 \u03be3 ,\n\nc1 , c2 , c3 \u2208 {1, 2}.\n\n(22)\n\nSimilarly we see that there are, respectively, 16, 12, 4 planes of kinds P1 , P2 , P3 .\nThe theorem now follows, since planes of the same kind are seen to correspond\nto conjugate Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 subgroups.\nFinally let us consider subgroups H \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 of G81 . Such a subgroup\nhA\u03c1 , A\u03c3 i arises from a corresponding line hh\u03c1i, h\u03c3ii \u2282 PG(3, 3), and so we need\nto classify lines with respect to the G(L4 )-distinguished basis B\u03b5 . If nw points\nof a line L \u2282 PG(3, 3) have weight w, w \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}, with respect to the basis\nB\u03b5 then we will say that L has weight pattern \u03c0\u03b5 (L) = (n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 ).\n8\n\n\fTheorem 10. The normal subgroup G81 < G(L4 ) contains precisely 130 subgroups \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 . These fall into seven conjugacy classes K1 , . . . , K7 of G(L4 ),\nof respective sizes 6, 24, 16, 12, 16, 48, 8.\nProof. Each subgroup hA\u03c1 , A\u03c3 i \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 arises from a corresponding line\nhh\u03c1i, h\u03c3ii \u2282 PG(3, 3), and there exist precisely 130 lines in PG(3, 3). With respect to the G(L4 )-distinguished tetrahedron of reference T\u03b5 the 130 lines L are\nof seven kinds \u039b1 , . . . , \u039b7 as described in the following table.\nL \u2208 \u039b1\nL \u2208 \u039b2\nL \u2208 \u039b3\nL \u2208 \u039b4\nL \u2208 \u039b5\nL \u2208 \u039b6\nL \u2208 \u039b7\n\n\u03c0e (L)\n(2, 2, 0, 0)\n(1, 1, 2, 0)\n(0, 3, 1, 0)\n(0, 2, 0, 2)\n(1, 0, 1, 2)\n(0, 1, 2, 1)\n(0, 0, 4, 0)\n\n|\u039bi |\n6\n24\n16\n12\n16\n48\n8\n\n(23)\n\nThe theorem now follows since lines of the same kind correspond to conjugate\nZ3 \u00d7 Z3 subgroups.\n\n3.2\n\nThe 27-set 'denizens' of \u03c94\n\nIt follows from Theorem 9 that the 81-set \u03c94 is populated by 40 triplets\n{R, R\u2032 , R\u2032\u2032 } of 27-set 'denizens', as in (17), and that these triplets, and the\n120 denizens of \u03c94 , can be classified into four kinds C0 , C1 , C2 , C3 . One of our\naims is to show that precisely eight of these triplets are triplets of Segre varieties S3 (2). So it helps to remind ourselves at this point about certain aspects\nof a Segre variety S = S3 (2) in PG(7, 2), and to relate our present concerns to\nthose in [4], [5] and [11].\nFirst of all, S defines a (273 , 273 ) configuration, each of the 27 points of\nS lying on precisely 3 lines \u2282 S, namely three of the 27 generators of S.\nMoreover the stabilizer group GS of S contains as a normal subgroup a group\nhA1 , A2 , A3 i \u223c\n= Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z3 which acts transitively on the 27 points of S, the\nthree generators of S through a point p \u2208 S being the lines\nLr (p) := {p, Ar p, (Ar )2 p}, r = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(24)\n\nHere Ar satisfies (Ar )2 + Ar + I = 0, each Z3 group hAr i acting fixed-point-free\non PG(7, 2). Further, as noted in [11, Theorem 5], S determines a distinguished\nZ3 -subgroup hW i which also acts fixed-point-free on PG(7, 2), the distinguished\ntangent, see [11, Section 2.1], at p \u2208 S being the line {p, W p, W 2 p}. Moreover,\nsee [11, Section 4.2], under the action of the distinguished Z3 -subgroup hW i the\nSegre variety S gave rise to a triplet {S, S \u2032 = W (S), S \u2032\u2032 = W 2 (S)} of Segre\nvarieties. In [4, p. 82] (although without proof and using a different notation),\n[5, Proposition 5] and [11, Section 4.1] the five GS -orbits O1 , O2 , O3 , O4 , O5 of\n\n9\n\n\fpoints were described, with O5 = S and O4 = S \u2032 \u222a S \u2032\u2032 . These are related to the\nfour G(L4 )-orbits (5) in the following simple manner:\n\u03c91 = O1 ,\n\n\u03c92 = O2 ,\n\n\u03c93 = O3 ,\n\n\u03c94 = O4 \u222a O5 = S \u222a S \u2032 \u222a S \u2032\u2032 .\n\n(25)\n\nSo \u03c94 is a single orbit under the action of the group hA1 , A2 , A3 , W i \u223c\n= (Z3 )4 ,\nthis last thus being the group G81 in our present context.\nLemma 11. If p \u2208 \u03c94 and \u03bb \u2208 (F3 )4 , \u03bb 6= 0000, then L\u03bbp := {p, A\u03bb p, A2\u03bb p} is a\nline in \u03c94 if and only if \u00b1\u03bb \u2208 \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 .\nProof. We already know, see (13), that L\u03bbp is a line if \u03bb \u2208 \u039e\u222a\u039e\u2217 or if \u2212\u03bb \u2208 \u039e\u222a\u039e\u2217 .\nAlso, as noted after equation (21), if \u00b1\u03bb \u2208\n/ \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 then wt\u03b5 (\u03bb) < 4, and so\n\u03bb = mnrs where at least one of m, n, r, s is 0. For example, suppose \u03bb = mnr0,\nwhere m, n, r \u2208 F3 . Then (I + A\u03bb + A2\u03bb )Uijkl = U\u2205\u2205\u2205l 6= 0.\nRemark 12. A partial affine space, see [1, p. 35] or [6, p. 794], is an affine\nspace from which some parallel classes have been removed. For example, the\naffine space on (F3 )4 turns into a partial affine space if we consider only affine\nlines with a direction vector \u00b1\u03bb \u2208 \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 and restrict the parallelism of (F3 )4\nto the set of those lines. Lemma 11 shows that \u03c94 arises as the point set of an\nisomorphic partial affine space in the following way: The lines in \u03c94 are of the\nform L\u03bbp with \u00b1\u03bb \u2208 \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 . Two lines are parallel if they belong to the same\ndistinguished spread Lijk\n85 .\nTheorem 13. A triplet of 27-sets {RH , R\u2032H , R\u2032\u2032H } in (17) which arises from a\n(Z3 )3 subgroup H = {A\u03bb | \u03bb \u2208 V3 } will consist of Segre varieties S3 (2) if and\nonly if the projective plane P = PV3 \u2282 PG(3, 3) is of kind P0 . So the 81-set \u03c94\ncontains precisely 24 copies of a Segre variety S3 (2).\nProof. Since each point of a Segre S = S3 (2) lies on precisely three generators\nof S, see (24), it follows from the preceding lemma that in order for RH to be\na S3 (2) the subgroup H must be of the form hA\u03bb , A\u03bc , A\u03bd i for precisely three\nelement \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 . But a straightforward check shows that planes of\nthe kinds P0 , P1 , P2 , P3 contain, respectively, precisely 3, 2, 4, 0 points h\u03bbi with\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 . So only in the eight cases where the Z3 subgroup H < G81 is of\nkind C0 can RH be Segre variety S3 (2). By (25) for one such subgroup a Segre\nvariety arises and, by Theorem 9, the same holds for the remaining subgroups\nof kind C0 .\nRemark 14. It is easy to check that if all three of \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd are in \u039e, or if all three\nare in \u039e\u2217 , then P(\u227a\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd\u227b) is a plane in PG(3, 3) of kind P0 , thus accounting\nfor all eight planes of kind P0 . But if \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd are split 2, 1 or 1, 2 between \u039e, \u039e\u2217 ,\nthen we see that H = hA\u03bb , A\u03bc , A\u03bd i contains a fourth Z3 subgroup hA\u03c1 i with\n\u03c1 \u2208 \u039e \u222a \u039e\u2217 : for example, observe results such as\n\u227a\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1\u2217 \u227b = \u227a\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1\u2217 , \u03b2 \u2217 \u227b,\n\nand \u227a\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2217 \u227b = \u227a\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2217 , \u03b4 \u2217 \u227b.\n\n(26)\n\nSo such a (Z3 )3 subgroup H is of kind C2 , not C0 , and RH gives rise to a\n(274 , 363 ) configuration in contrast to the (273 , 273 ) configuration arising from\na S3 (2).\n10\n\n\fIt was proved in [11, Theorem 18] that a Segre variety S3 (2) in PG(7, 2) has\na sextic equation. In fact, from our results in Section 1.2 we can deduce that\nif S is any of the 24 copies of a Segre variety S3 (2) in \u03c94 then S has a sextic\nequation of the form QS (x) = 0 where, for some polynomial FS of degree < 6,\nQS = x[\n[\n[\n[\n1 x8 + x\n2 x7 + x\n3 x6 + x\n4 x5 + FS .\n\n(27)\n\nFor recall from (25) that \u03c94 = O4 \u222a O5 where O5 = S. Now, see [11, Theorem\n17], the 201-set (O4 )c := \u03c91 \u222a \u03c92 \u222a \u03c93 \u222a S has a quartic equation, say FS\u2032 = 0,\nand, see Theorem 4, O4 \u222a S has sextic equation Q6 + Q4 + Q2 = 0. It follows\nthat S has equation Q6 + Q4 + Q2 + FS\u2032 = 0 which, see (9), is of the form (27).\n\n3.3\n\nNon-Segre triplets in \u03c94\n\nWhen the authors first considered 27-sets such as R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2217 = {A\u03c1 u}\u03c1\u2208\u227a\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 \u2217\u227b\nthey were briefly misled into thinking that R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2217 was a Segre S3 (2). Upon\ndiscovering their error, see (26), they decided that all the 'deceitful' non-Segre\n27-sets in \u03c94 should be termed 'rogues'. In this terminology we can summarize\nour foregoing results as follows.\nThe 81-set \u03c94 is populated by 120 denizen 27-sets which occur as\n40 triplets {R, R\u2032 , R\u2032\u2032 } such that R \u222a R\u2032 \u222a R\u2032\u2032 = \u03c94 . Of these triplets\neight are of Segre varieties S3 (2), sixteen are of rogues of kind C1 ,\ntwelve are of rogues of kind C2 and four are of rogues of kind C3 .\nSince a Segre variety S3 (2) spans PG(7, 2), the next two theorems confirm\nin a more vivid manner that rogues of kinds C2 and C3 are not Segre varieties.\nTheorem 15. Suppose that a 27-set R \u2282 \u03c94 is a rogue of kind C2 . Then hRi\nis a 5-flat in PG(7, 2).\nProof. Six of the twelve planes of kind P2 are those having equations of the\nkind \u03ber = \u03bes and the other six are those having equations of the kind \u03ber = 2\u03bes .\nConsider a plane P = PV3 in the first six, say with equation \u03be3 = \u03be4 . Then, see\n(3), the subset \u03b8u (V3 ) consists of the 27 points\nR := {Uijkk | i, j, k \u2208 F3 = {0, 1, 2}}.\n\n(28)\n\nNow any two elements a, b of a line Lh \u2208 L4 satisfy a * b = 1 if a 6= b and a * b = 0\nif a = b. So the three points of the line\nLR := {U\u2205\u220500 , U\u2205\u220511 , U\u2205\u220522 } \u2282 hLc , Ld i\nare perpendicular to every point of R. However this is not the case for any other\npoint of PG(7, 2), and so hRi is the 5-flat (LR )\u22a5 . A plane P = PV3 in the second\nsix, say with equation \u03be3 = 2\u03be4 = \u2212\u03be4 , can be treated similarly, with the subset\n\u03b8u (V3 ) consisting of the 27 points\nR\u2217 := {Uijkk | i, j, k \u2208 F3 = {0, 1, 2}},\n11\n\n(29)\n\n\fwhere, for k \u2208 F3 , k denotes \u2212k(= 2k). If R\u2217 is as in (29) then we see that hR\u2217 i\nis the 5-flat (LR\u2217 )\u22a5 where\nLR\u2217 := {U\u2205\u220500 , U\u2205\u220512 , U\u2205\u220521 } \u2282 hLc , Ld i.\nRemark 16. Consider the triplet {R, R\u2032 , R\u2032\u2032 } of kind C2 which contains R as in\n(28). Then R\u2032 = A\u03bc (R) and R\u2032\u2032 = A2\u03bc (R) for suitable \u03bc \u2208 (F3 )4 , for example\n\u03bc = 0001. Consequently\nLR\u2032 := {U\u2205\u220501 , U\u2205\u220512 , U\u2205\u220520 },\n\nLR\u2032\u2032 := {U\u2205\u220502 , U\u2205\u220510 , U\u2205\u220521 }.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of the triplet {R\u2217 , R\u2032\u2217 , R\u2032\u2032\u2217 } of kind C2 which contains R\u2217\nas in (29) we see that\nLR\u2032\u2217 := {U\u2205\u220501 , U\u2205\u220510 , U\u2205\u220522 },\n\nLR\u2032\u2032\u2217 := {U\u2205\u220502 , U\u2205\u220511 , U\u2205\u220520 }.\n\nSo the three lines {LR , LR\u2032 , LR\u2032\u2032 } are a regulus in the 3-flat hLc , Ld i, and the\nthree lines {LR\u2217 , LR\u2032\u2217 , LR\u2032\u2032\u2217 } are the opposite regulus, the 9-set supporting the\ntwo reguli being that hyperbolic quadric H3 in the 3-flat hLc , Ld i which has Lc\nand Ld as its two external lines. Of course similar considerations apply to all\ntwelve of the planes in PG(3, 3) of kind P2 . Thus each of the six pairs of lines in\nL4 gives rise to a pair of opposite reguli and hence to a set of 6 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 36 lines\nL \u2282 \u03c92 . Each such L gives rise to a rogue R of kind C2 , namely to R = L\u22a5 \u2229 \u03c94 .\nTheorem 17. Suppose that a 27-set R \u2282 \u03c94 is a rogue of kind C3 . Then hRi\nis a 6-flat in PG(7, 2).\nProof. By Theorem 9 there are four triplets in \u03c94 of kind C3 , which arise from the\nfour planes \u03ber = 0, r \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}. Consider the plane P = PV3 with equation\n\u03be4 = 0. Then, see (3), it gives rise to the following triplet of 27-sets\nR := {Uijk0 }, R\u2032 := {Uijk1 }, R\u2032\u2032 := {Uijk2 },\n\ni, j, k \u2208 F3 = {0, 1, 2}.\n\nIt quickly follows that hRi, hR\u2032 i and hR\u2032\u2032 i are 6-flats, namely\nhRi = hU\u2205\u2205\u22050 i\u22a5 , hR\u2032 i = hU\u2205\u2205\u22051 i\u22a5 , hR\u2032\u2032 i = hU\u2205\u2205\u22052 i\u22a5 ,\nwhere {U\u2205\u2205\u22050 , U\u2205\u2205\u22051 , U\u2205\u2205\u22052 } = Ld . Of course the other three triplets in \u03c94 of kind\nC3 are associated in a similar way with the other three lines La , Lb , Lc \u2208 L4 .\n\n4\n4.1\n\nIntersection properties\nIntroduction\n\nIf \u22061 and \u22062 are any two distinct triplets of 27-set denizens of \u03c94 note that\nN (\u22061 , \u22062 ) := {R1 \u2229 R2 : R1 \u2208 \u22061 , R2 \u2208 \u22062 }\n\n(30)\n\nis an ennead of 9-sets which provides a partition of \u03c94 . For suppose that H1\nand H2 are two (Z3 )3 subgroups of G81 whose orbits in \u03c94 yield the triplets \u22061\n12\n\n\fand \u22062 . Then the (Z3 )2 subgroup H = H1 \u2229 H2 yields one member {hu, h \u2208 H}\nof the ennead of 9-sets (30), the other members of the ennead being the other\norbits of H in \u03c94 .\nSince the origin of the present research arose from our interest in Segre varieties S3 (2) in PG(7, 2), let us at least look at the different kinds of intersection\nS \u2229 R of a Segre variety S \u2282 \u03c94 with another 27-set denizen R of \u03c94 . Such\nan intersection we will term a section of the Segre S. Recall from Theorem\n13 that a Segre variety S \u2282 \u03c94 arises as SH := {hu, h \u2208 H} from a (Z3 )3\nsubgroup H < G81 which is of class C0 , being the image, under the isomorphism A in (18), of a 3-dimensional subspace V3 such that the projective plane\nP = PV3 \u2282 PG(3, 3) is of kind P0 .\nLemma 18. Suppose that P = PV3 \u2282 PV (4, 3) is a projective plane of kind P0 .\nThen the 13 lines L \u2282 P fall into three G(L4 )-orbits:\n(i) 3 lines of kind \u039b4 ;\n(ii) 6 lines of kind \u039b6 ;\n(iii) 4 lines of kind \u039b3 .\nProof. Without loss of generality we may, see Remark 14, consider the particular\nplane\nP = PV\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ,\nwhere V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u227a\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4\u227b \u2282 V (4, 3) = (F3 )4 .\nObserve that the 13 lines in the plane P are as follows:\n(i) the 3 lines P\u227a\u03b2, \u03b3\u227b, P\u227a\u03b2, \u03b4\u227b, P\u227a\u03b3, \u03b4\u227b of weight pattern (0, 2, 0, 2);\n(ii) the 6 lines P\u227a\u03b2, \u03b3 \u00b1 \u03b4\u227b, P\u227a\u03b3, \u03b2 \u00b1 \u03b4\u227b, P\u227a\u03b4, \u03b2 \u00b1 \u03b3\u227b of weight pattern\n(0, 1, 2, 1);\n(iii) the 4 lines P\u227a\u03b2 \u00b1 \u03b3, \u03b2 \u00b1 \u03b4\u227b of weight pattern (0, 3, 1, 0).\nHence, see (23), the stated result holds.\nEquivalently expressed, the thirteen Z3 \u00d7 Z3 subgroups of hA\u03b2 , A\u03b3 , A\u03b4 i < G81\ncomprise: (i) three of class K4 (ii) six of class K6 (iii) four of class K3 .\n\n4.2\n\nSections of a Segre variety S \u2282 \u03c94\n\nWithout loss of generality we may consider the particular Segre variety S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 :=\nSH where H = hA\u03b2 , A\u03b3 , A\u03b4 i:\nS\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u03b8u (V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ),\n\nwhere V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u227a\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4\u227b \u2282 (F3 )4 .\n\nIn detail the 27 elements of V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 are:\n0000 1221 2112\n2121 0012 1200\n1212 2100 0021\n\nT\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n2211 0102 1020\n1002 2220 0111\n0120 1011 2202\n\nT\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n1122 2010 0201\n0210 1101 2022\n2001 0222 1110\n\n. (31)\n\nIn the display (31) the rows of each 9-set are orbits of hT\u03b2 i and the columns\nof each 9-set are orbits of hT\u03b3 i, where T\u03bb denotes the translation which maps\n13\n\n\f\u03bc \u2208 (F3 )4 to \u03bb + \u03bc \u2208 (F3 )4 ; of course (T\u03bb )2 = T2\u03bb . Incidentally observe from\n(31) that, in conformity with (22), V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is that 3-dimensional subspace of V (4, 3)\nhaving the equation\n\u03be1 + \u03be2 + \u03be3 + \u03be4 = 0.\nUsing the basis B, with \u03b6h as in (12), we see, in the shorthand notation of\nEq. (14), that S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 thus consists of the following 27 points:\nu 1256 3478\n5678 56u 78u\n1234 12u 34u\n\nA\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n2358 25u 38u\n58u 137u 246u\n23u 468u 157u\n\nA\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n1467 16u 47u\n67u 248u 135u\n14u 357u 268u\n\n. (32)\n\nObserve that each 9-set in (32) is a Segre variety S2 (2), whose generators are\nthe rows and columns in the display, these being orbits of, respectively, hA\u03b2 i\nand hA\u03b3 i.\nActing upon S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 with a Z3 subgroup of G81 which is not in hA\u03b2 , A\u03b3 , A\u03b4 i, for\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nexample with hA\u03b1 i, will produce the siblings S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n, S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nof S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 , these siblings\nbeing the images under \u03b8u of the two affine subspaces in V (4, 3) = (F3 )4 which\nare translates of V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 .\nRecalling the proof of Lemma 18, let us make the following choices of representatives for the three kinds of 2-dimensional subspaces V2 \u2282 V\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 :\n(i) \u227a\u03b2, \u03b3\u227b,\n\n(ii) \u227a\u03b4, \u03b2 + \u03b3\u227b,\n\n(iii) \u227a\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3, \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u227b.\n\nFor the choice (i) the nine elements of V2 = \u227a\u03b2, \u03b3\u227b are those in the first 9-set\nin (31). The corresponding section \u03b8u (V2 ) of S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is the first of the three S2 (2)\nvarieties in (32).\nFor the choice (ii) the nine elements of V2 = \u227a\u03b4, \u03b2 + \u03b3\u227b satisfy \u03be1 = \u03be2 and\nare those underlined in:\n0000 1221 2112\n2121 0012 1200\n1212 2100 0021\n\nT\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n2211 0102 1020\n1002 2220 0111\n0120 1011 2202\n\nT\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n1122 2010 0201\n0210 1101 2022\n2001 0222 1110\n\n.\n\nWe will term the resulting section \u03b8u (V2 ) of the S3 (2) a 3-generator set: it\nconsists of three parallel generators of S3 (2) which meet a 'perpendicular' S2 (2)\nin three points no two of which lie on the same generator of the S2 (2).\nFinally the nine elements of V2 = \u227a\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3, \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u227b satisfy \u03be4 = 0 and are those\nunderlined in:\n0000 1221 2112\n2121 0012 1200\n1212 2100 0021\n\nT\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n2211 0102 1020\n1002 2220 0111\n0120 1011 2202\n\nT\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n1122 2010 0201\n0210 1101 2022\n2001 0222 1110\n\n.\n\nWe will term the resulting section \u03b8u (V2 ) of the S3 (2) a fan:\nDefinition 19. A subset F of nine points of a S3 (2) is a fan (= f ar-apart nine)\nif no two points of F lie on the same generator. (So if F is a fan for a S3 (2) then\nthe 3 generators through each of the 9 points of F account for all 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\ngenerators of S3 (2).)\n14\n\n\fWe may summarize the foregoing as follows.\nTheorem 20. A section of a Segre variety S3 (2) in \u03c94 is either (i) a S2 (2), or\n(ii) a 3-generator set, or (iii) a fan.\n\n4.3\n\nHamming distances and troikas\n\nIn the GF(3) space V (4, 3) = (F3 )4 we have been employing the basis B\u03b5 :=\n{\u03b51 , \u03b52 , \u03b53 , \u03b54 }, see (20). Using this basis it helps at times to make use of the\nassociated Hamming distance hd\u03b5 (\u03c1, \u03c3) between two elements \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 (F3 )4 , as\ndefined by\nhd\u03b5 (\u03c1, \u03c3) = wt\u03b5 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3).\nRemark 21. If \u03c1, \u03c3 are belong to the same row in (21) observe that hd\u03b5 (\u03c1, \u03c3) =\n2, while if \u03c1, \u03c3 belong to different rows then hd\u03b5 (\u03c1, \u03c3) is odd.\nThe next lemma demonstrates that some aspects of orthogonality in the\nGF(2) space PG(7, 2) can be neatly dealt with in GF(3) terms.\nLemma 22. Two points p\u03c1 , p\u03c3 \u2208 \u03c94 are orthogonal or non-orthogonal according\nas hd\u03b5 (\u03c1, \u03c3) is even or odd.\nProof. For two points uh (i), uh (j) \u2208 Lh we have uh (i) * uh (j) = 1 + \u03b4ij . Hence if\n\u03c1 = ijkl and \u03c3 = i\u2032 j \u2032 k \u2032 l\u2032 it follows that p\u03c1 * p\u03c3 = \u03b4ii\u2032 + \u03b4jj \u2032 + \u03b4kk\u2032 + \u03b4ll\u2032 , whence\nthe stated result.\nA description of the different sections of a Segre variety S \u2282 \u03c94 can sometimes be helped by the use of the alternative basis B\u039e := {\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b1} for\nV (4, 3) = (F3 )4 . Here, as in (21), \u03b2 = 1221, \u03b3 = 2121, \u03b4 = 2211, \u03b1 = 1111.\nThe change of basis equations are therefore:\n\u03b2 = \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 + \u03b54 ,\n\u03b4 = \u2212 \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52 + \u03b53 + \u03b54 ,\n\n\u03b3 = \u2212 \u03b51 + \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 + \u03b54 ,\n\u03b1 = \u03b51 + \u03b52 + \u03b53 + \u03b54 ,\n\n\u03b51 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4 + \u03b1,\n\u03b53 = \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 + \u03b4 + \u03b1,\n\n\u03b52 = \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4 + \u03b1,\n\u03b54 = \u03b2 + \u03b3 + \u03b4 + \u03b1.\n\n(33)\n\nObserve that the chosen ordering of the elements of the basis B\u039e results in the\nchange of basis matrix M having the simple properties Mt = M = M\u22121 .\nSo in V (4, 3) we now have available the Hamming distance in the basis B\u039e ,\nnamely\nhd\u039e (\u03c1, \u03c3) := wt\u039e (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3), \u03c1, \u03c3 \u2208 (F3 )4 ,\nwhere wt\u039e (\u03bb) denotes the weight of an element \u03bb \u2208 V (4, 3) in the basis B\u039e .\nLemma 23.\nwt\u039e (\u03bb) = 2 \u21d0\u21d2 wt\u03b5 (\u03bb) = 2,\nwt\u039e (\u03bb) = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 wt\u03b5 (\u03bb) = 4,\n\nwt\u039e (\u03bb) = 3 \u21d0\u21d2 wt\u03b5 (\u03bb) = 3,\nwt\u039e (\u03bb) = 4 \u21d0\u21d2 wt\u03b5 (\u03bb) = 1.\n15\n\n(34)\n\n\fProof. The results (34) follow immediately from (33).\nLet us also define the Hamming distance hd(p\u03c1 , p\u03c3 ) between two points\np\u03c1 , p\u03c3 \u2208 \u03c94 to be\nhd(p\u03c1 , p\u03c3 ) := hd\u039e (\u03c1, \u03c3).\nObserve that this definition does not depend upon the choice of the point u\nused in the bijective correspondence \u03b8u in (19), due to the invariance of hd\u039e\nunder translations: hd\u039e (\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03bb + \u03c3) = hd\u039e (\u03c1, \u03c3). Suppose that we confine our\nattention to points p, p\u2032 , . . . on a particular Segre variety in \u03c94 , say S = S \u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nin (32). Then observe that hd(p, p\u2032 ) = d, d \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, provided that p\u2032 can\nbe obtained from p only by the use of at least d of the generating subgroups\nhA\u03b2 i, hA\u03b3 i, hA\u03b4 i of S. In particular distinct points p and p\u2032 lie on the same\ngenerator of S if and only if hd(p, p\u2032 ) = 1. This Hamming distance on S appears\nalso in [5].\nDefinition 24. (i) A troika on a given S3 (2) variety S in \u03c94 is a set of three\npoints of S which are hd\u039e = 3 apart.\n(ii) The centre of a troika t = {p1 , p2 , p3 } is the point c(t) = p1 + p2 + p3 .\nFor example, the three points u, 246u, 357u \u2208 S\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 in (32) are hd\u039e = 3 apart\nand so form a troika. Alternatively this follows from (34) since 0000, 0111, 0222\nin (31) are hd\u03b5 = 3 apart.\nTheorem 25. (i) A fan F for a Segre variety S in \u03c94 can be uniquely expressed\nas the union F = t \u222a t\u2032 \u222a t\u2032\u2032 of a triplet of troikas.\n(ii) The three troikas t, t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 in F share the same centre, say cF .\n(iii) Moreover a fan F for S determines uniquely a triplet T = {F , F \u2032 , F \u2032\u2032 }\nof fans such that F \u222a F \u2032 \u222a F \u2032\u2032 = S. Further, L(T ) := {cF , cF \u2032 , cF \u2032\u2032 } is one of\nthe lines of the H7 -tetrad L4 .\nProof. Suppose that S = \u03b8u (V3 ) and that F \u2282 S is a fan which contains u.\n(i) So F = \u03b8u (V2 ), V2 \u2282 V3 , where the projective line L = PV2 is of kind \u039b3 ,\nwith line pattern (0, 3, 1, 0). Consequently L has a unique point h\u03bbi with wt(\u03bb) =\n3. Hence the element 0000 \u2208 (F3 )4 has the unique extension V1 := {0000, \u03bb, 2\u03bb}\nto a 3-set of elements of V2 which are Hamming distance 3 apart. So the point\nu belongs to a unique troika t \u2282 F , namely t := \u03b8u (V1 ) = {u, A\u03bb u, A2\u03bb u}. If\nV2 = \u227a\u03bb, \u03bc\u227b, the two translates T\u03bc (V1 ), T2\u03bc (V1 ) of V1 in V2 yield two other\ntroikas t\u2032 = A\u03bc t, t\u2032\u2032 = A2\u03bc t, giving rise to the claimed unique decomposition\nF = t \u222a t\u2032 \u222a t\u2032\u2032 .\n(ii) Since wt(\u03bb) = 3, precisely one of the coordinates of \u03bb in the basis B\u03b5 is\nzero. First suppose \u03bb satisfies \u03be4 = 0. Then for PV2 = P(\u227a\u03bb, \u03bc\u227b) to be of kind\n\u039b3 the element \u03bc must also satisfy \u03be4 = 0. So a point p \u2208 F must be of the\nform Uijk0 . Hence that troika {p, A\u03bb p, A2\u03bb p} \u2282 F which contains p has centre\nc = (I + A\u03bb + (A\u03bb )2 )Uijk0 = U\u2205\u2205\u22050 .\n\n(35)\n\nSo the same point c = U\u2205\u2205\u22050 , which lies on the line Ld \u2208 L4 , is the centre of each\nof the three troikas in F . Of course, if instead \u03bb satisfies \u03bei = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3\n16\n\n\fthen the analogous reasoning shows that the common centre of the three troikas\nin F is U0\u2205\u2205\u2205 \u2208 La , U\u22050\u2205\u2205 \u2208 Lb or U\u2205\u22050\u2205 \u2208 Lc , according as i = 1, 2 or 3.\n(iii) We are dealing with S = \u03b8u (V3 ) where V3 is of the form V3 = V2 \u2295\n\u227a\u03bd\u227b, V2 = \u227a\u03bb, \u03bc\u227b, and where may choose \u03bd to have wt\u03b5 = 4. The fan F =\n\u03b8u (V2 ) determines a triplet T = {F , F \u2032 , F \u2032\u2032 } of fans, where F \u2032 = A\u03bd (F ) and\nF \u2032\u2032 = A2\u03bd (F ), such that F \u222a F \u2032 \u222a F \u2032\u2032 = S. Moreover if cF = U\u2205\u2205\u22050 as in (35)\nthen cF \u2032 = A\u03bd cF , cF \u2032\u2032 = A2\u03bd cF will be the other two points U\u2205\u2205\u22051 , U\u2205\u2205\u22052 of\nthe line Ld . Similarly for the other three cases considered in (ii) above, where\n{cF , cF \u2032 , cF \u2032\u2032 } is one of the other lines of the tetrad L4 .\nIn the paper [11] the fact that a Segre variety S = S3 (2) in PG(7, 2) determines a distinguished tetrad L4 of lines which span PG(7, 2) only emerged\nrather late, see [11, Section 4.1]. One of the motivations for the present paper\nwas to come to a clearer understanding of the relationship between S and L4 .\nThis can now be achieved: see the next theorem, where it is shown how to\nobtain the same tetrad L4 from any of the 24 copies of a Segre variety S3 (2) in\nthe 81-set \u03c94 .\nTheorem 26. A Segre variety S in \u03c94 determines precisely four triplets Ti , i \u2208\n(1, 2, 3, 4) of fans; further the resulting four lines Li := L(Ti ) are the four lines\nof the H7 -tetrad L4 .\nProof. A Segre variety in \u03c94 is of the form S = \u03b8u (V3 ) where the projective\nplane P = PV3 \u2282 PG(3, 3) is of kind P0 . Now, see (31), there are precisely 8\nelements of V3 of weight 3, and these form 4 pairs, say {\u00b1\u03bb1 }, {\u00b1\u03bb2 }, {\u00b1\u03bb3 },\n{\u00b1\u03bb3 }. Consequently the element 0000 \u2208 V3 has precisely 4 extensions, namely\n{0000, \u03bbi, \u2212\u03bbi }, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, to a 3-set of elements of V3 which are Hamming\ndistance 3 apart. Hence the point u = \u03b8u (0000) lies in precisely 4 troikas and,\nby Theorem 25(i), in precisely 4 fans Fi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4. By Theorem 25(iii) each\nof the resulting 4 triplets Ti = {Fi , Fi\u2032 , Fi\u2032\u2032 } of fans determines a line L(Ti ) of\nthe tetrad L4 . Further, from the proof of Theorem 25(iii), we see that these\nlines are distinct.\n\n4.4\n\nFuture research\n\nWe are of the opinion that some further investigation of the denizens of \u03c94 , and\nof their interactions, should prove worthwhile. Moreover such an investigation\nshould not be confined to the 27-set denizens arising from Theorem 9, since at\nleast some of the 9-set denizens of \u03c94 arising from Theorem 10 deserve attention.\nIn particular the 9-sets in \u03c94 which arise from those lines in the table (23)\nwhich have weight pattern (0, 0, 4, 0) are certainly noteworthy. For suppose that\nV (2, 3) \u2282 V (4, 3) is such that L = PV (2, 3) is of kind \u039b7 , and so wt\u03b5 (\u03c1) = 3 for\nevery nonzero element \u03c1 \u2208 V (2, 3). It follows that any pair of distinct elements\n\u03c1, \u03c3 of V (2, 3) are Hamming distance 3 apart, and hence, by Lemma 22, the\npoints p\u03c1 , p\u03c3 are non-perpendicular: p\u03c1 * p\u03c3 = 1. In this easy manner we have\nconstructed a 9-cap N = {p\u03c1 }\u03c1\u2208V (2,3) on the quadric H7 . Moreover under the\n\n17\n\n\faction on N of G81 we will obtain a partition of the 81-set \u03c94 into an ennead of\nquadric 9-caps.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Blunck and A.
