The demodulator was tested in the frequency range from 100 MHz to 25\nGHz using amplitude modulated input signals. An input power of 0 dBm (1 mW) was used\nwhich is the typical power emitted for short range wireless communication systems, such as\nBluetooth. The graphene demodulator exhibits good signal response in the frequency range\nassociated to industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio band (2.4 GHz).\n______________________________________________________________\n*Corresponding author: danieladragoman@yahoo.com\n\n\f2\nThe radio is moving ahead towards nanoscale devices and is termed as nanoradio. Its\nextremely miniature dimensions pave the way for new applications of nanoradio are opened not\nonly in free-space (Bluetooth devices or RFID tags) but in blood stream for controlled drug\ndelivery , implant monitoring1,2 and energy harvesting 3.\nUp to now, the nanoradio was based on NEMS (nano-electromechanical systems) based\non carbon nanotubes which are 4-5 orders of magnitude smaller than the actual radios\nimplemented with advanced Si technologies. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cantilevers\nwhich were electrostically actuated and had resonance frequencies in the range 100 MHz-5 GHz.\nThe first nanoradio4 was based on such a NEMS resonator which has performed all the functions\nof a radio i.e. the carrier signal generation and modulation and detection. The CNT emitter and\nthe cathode were sealed in a high vacuum enclosure. This nanoradio had serious drawbacks: the\nbias was around 200 V and the tunning was only 4 MHz. On the contrary, the tunneling\nnanoradio 5 had a larger tunability covering the FM or AM radio bands and could be biased with\nbatteries, but its fabrication is very difficult. The nonlinear current\u2212voltage dependence of CNT\nwas used to demodulate the RF signal, but the demodulated current was very low (few nA) while\nparasitic capacitances hindered operation beyond 2 GHz6. A double\u2013clamped CNT in FET\nconfiguration was recently proposed for the demodulation of RF signals7. AM and FM\ndemodulation were demonstrated, but the detected current was very weak 0.1-0.2 nA.In fact, a\nlock-in IF amplifier was used to prove the concept.\nAlthough the CNT-based NEMS have mechanical resonant frequencies within the RF\nspectrum (0.05-5 GHz) and high quality factors (103) the\n\nresulting NEMS based radios\n\ndemonstrated lack of robustness, narrow bandwidths and weak output currents, all of which\ncombined lead to serious noise issues. Therefore, it is uncertain if these devices will be ever used\nin real-life RF systems in which external mechanical vibration and external RF noise are always\npresent. Moreover, there are numerous Si based electronic devices and integrated circuits that\ncan be readily fabricated while exhibiting higher performances. So, the challenge is to find other\n\n\f3\nnanomaterials able to maintain the small size of NEMS radios, but capable of working in larger\nbandwidths, and providing higher amplitudes of the detected signals.\nThus, along this line, this paper reports on the investigation of the capability of a\ngraphene monolayer flake to detect radio waves in the RF spectrum and beyond. The graphene\nradio wave detector was fabricated on a high-resistivity Si substrate with resistivity greater than\n8 k\u03a9, on which 300 nm of SiO2 were grown by thermal oxidation. The graphene monolayer\ndeposition on Si/SiO2 substrate and the structural characterization (optical images, Raman\nspectroscopy) were performed by Graphene Industries. Over the graphene monolayer three\nparallel metallic electrodes forming a coplanar waveguide (CPW) were patterned. RF pads were\nconnected to both ends of the CPW to facilitate easy connection with probe station. In the CPW\nconfiguration, the central conductor is the signal electrode and the outer conductors are ground\nelectrodes. The first port of the device was used to inject the microwave signal in the graphene\nbased detector and the second port was used to collect the detected signal. This structure may in\nfact be directly integrated with pre-existing Si devices and circuits. The detection of the\nmodulated microwave signal is based on the nonlinear current-voltage dependence of the\ngraphene when connected with gold contacts. This nonlinear I-V dependence has the shape of\ntwo leaky back-to-back Schottky diodes as is described in Ref. 8 and the references herein.\nFabrication details are fond in Ref.8.\nThe graphene radio wave detector is presented in Fig. 1 and its DC current-voltage (I-V)\ncharacteristic are shown in Fig. 2. The observed nonlinear I-V dependence is modeled as two\nleaky back-to-back Schottky diodes (see Ref.8 and the references herein).This inherent\nnonlinearity will be further exploited in this paper for radio wave detection. The set-up for\ndetecting radio-waves using a graphene loaded CPW presented in Fig. 1 follows the\nconfiguration of a radio receiver. The graphene radio wave detector was excited by an Agilent\nE8257D with an AM modulated carrier signal. The carrier frequency signal was varied in the\nfrequency range 100 MHz-50 GHz and AM modulation signal was within audio signals\n\n\f4\nfrequency. The graphene radio wave detector was biased by a current source via a bias tee. The\ngraphene radio wave is placed on the on-wafer probe station and its input and output are\nconnected to the AM signal generator and the low noise amplifier (LNA) , respectively by probe\ntips. The detection signal was monitored by the LNA(Stanford Research SR560) and a digital\noscilloscope (Tektronix , SR560) able to record the data.\nWe have used in the experiment carrier radio waves frequencies in the frequency range of\n100 MHz to 25 GHz at a constant power of 0dBm (1mW) which corresponds to the emitted\npower of Bluetooth standard (Class 3) radio, 1-5 m range. The above frequency range\nencompasses a huge frequency range i.e. RF spectrum (starting with VHF) and the microwave\nspectrum (L-K bands). The modulation is 1KHz which characterizes the human voice and is also\nthe central frequency of many audio hearing aids devices. The radio-wave detected voltage\ndependence on the frequency and current bias is displayed in Fig. 3 at various bias currents. We\ncan see that the maximum values of detected voltages are located in the range 1-5 GHz where the\nmajority of wireless applications are working today.Even without current bias, the graphene\nradio wave detectors exhibits a detected voltage in the range 0.005-0.2 V in the range 3-10 GHz\nspectrum (see Fig. 4). In Fig. 5, we have displayed the detected signal in time of AM radio wave\nsignal. Due to the limitations of the measurement setup higher modulation frequency was not\nmeasured but indications exists that it could be detected as well with similar results. In\nconclusion, AM modulated radio waves were demodulated at room temperature in the frequency\nrange 0.1-25 GHz by a simple detector device based on a monolayer graphene embedded in a\ncoplanar line. This concept paves the way towards simplified nanodetctors for both digital as\nwell as analog electronics while retaining CMOS compatibility.\nAcknowledgements M.Dragoman states that this work was supported by a grant of Romanian\nNational Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS-UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-ID-PCE2011-3-0071.
