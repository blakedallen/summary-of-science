Introduction\nSystems in which successful strategies spread by imitation or genetic reproduction\ncan be described by evolutionary game theory. Such models are routinely analyzed\nin evolutionary biology, sociology, anthropology and economics. Recently, the\napplication of methods from statistical physics to these systems has lead to many\nimportant insights [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nTraditionally, the dynamics is described by the replicator equations, where the\ngrowth rate of a strategy is associated with its relative success compared with the\npopulation average [6, 7].\nIn the past years, research has focused on stochastic evolutionary game dynamics\nin \u001cnite populations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In this\ncontext, a connection to the weak selection limit of population genetics has been\nestablished [8]. Weak selection means that the payo\u001b di\u001berences based on di\u001berent\nstrategic behavior in interactions represent only a small correction to otherwise\nrandom dynamics, similar to high temperature expansions in physics. Weak selection\nis considered as a relevant limit in biology, as most evolutionary changes are driven\nby small \u001ctness di\u001berences [23]. Moreover, it allows analytical approximations that\nare often impossible when selective di\u001berences in payo\u001bs are large [8, 24, 25].\nMost of the recent work that uses the weak selection approximation has been\nfocusing on the probability that a certain strategy takes over. The time associated\nwith this process has been calculated [26], but it received considerably less attention\nso far. Here, we present the weak selection corrections to the conditional and\nunconditional mean exit or \u001cxation times in evolutionary 2\u00d72 games with N players.\nThe conditional average time to \u001cxation tA1 is the expected time a single mutant\nneeds to take over the population, given that such a takeover occurs at all. The\nunconditional average time of \u001cxation t1 is the expectation value for the time until\nthe population is homogenous again after the arrival of a single mutant. This is\nregardless of wether the mutant type takes over the population or becomes extinct.\nEquivalently, the average \u001cxation times for such one dimensional random walks can\nalso be interpreted as mean \u001crst passage times or mean exit times [27, 28, 29].\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n3\n\nThroughout this paper, we use the payo\u001b matrix\nA\nB\n\nA B!\na b\n.\nc d\n\n(1)\n\nAn A player interacting with another A receives a. If it interacts with B , it obtains\nb. Similarly, B receives c from A and d from other B 's. Thus, the average payo\u001bs\nare\nN \u2212i\ni\u22121\na+\nb\nN \u22121\nN \u22121\ni\nN \u2212i\u22121\n\u03c0B (i) =\nc+\nd.\nN \u22121\nN \u22121\n\n\u03c0A (i) =\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nA quantity that is of particular interest is the di\u001berence between the average payo\u001bs,\n\u2206\u03c0(i) = \u03c0A (i) \u2212 \u03c0B (i) = u i + v,\n\n(4)\n\na + d \u2212 (b + c)\n,\nN \u22121\nN (b \u2212 d) \u2212 (a \u2212 d)\nv=\n.\nN \u22121\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nu=\n\n(6)\n\nWe show that under weak selection, the conditional time (tA1 ) during which a single\nmutant takes over the whole population depends only on u (and, of course, on the\npopulation size). The unconditional time (t1 ) during which the mutant either takes\nover the population or reaches extinction depends only on v (and the population\nsize). See Figure 1 for an illustration of the relevant quantities.\nOur manuscript is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce a particular\nevolutionary process for our analysis. Although our results are valid for a broader\nclass of processes, we only present the full calculation for this evolutionary process.\nIn Section 3, we recall the general form of \u001cxation probabilities and times. We discuss\nneutral selection in Section 4 as a prerequisite to the weak selection expansion, which\nwe explore in Section 5. In Section 6 we address the frequency dependent Moran\nprocess to underline the generality of our \u001cndings. The consequences of our analytical\nresults are discussed in Section 7.\n\n\flayers 1\n\n4\n\nFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\u03c61 (\u03b2, N, u, v)\ntA\n1 (\u03b2, N, u)\n\n\u03c61 (\u03b2, N, u, v)\ntA\n1 (\u03b2, N, u)\n\n(3)\n\nt1 (\u03b2, N, v)\nTi\u2212 (\u03b2, N, u, v) Ti+ (\u03b2, N, u, v)\n\nB\n\nof A players\n1\nNumber Number\nof A players\n0\n\nA\n\nNumber\nNumber of A players\ni of A players N\n\nNumber of A players\nFigure 1: Illustration of the most relevant quantities. We are interested in the evolutionary fate of\n\na single A player. All quantities depend on the intensity of selection \u03b2 and the population size N .\nThe payo\u001b di\u001berence between A and B players is given by \u2206\u03c0 = u i + v , with i as the number of\nA players. Both the transition probabilities Ti+ and Ti\u2212 and the probability that a single A player\ntakes over the population \u03c61 depend on u and v . But for weak selection, \u03b2 \u001c 1, the conditional\ntime tA\n1 during which a single A player takes over a population of B players only depends on u,\nwhereas the unconditional time t1 until either A or B has taken over the population only depends\non v .\n\n2. Fermi process\nIn a \u001cnite population of size N with two possible strategies A and B , the state of\nthe system is characterized by the number of type A individuals i. In general, the\ndynamics is stochastic. In each time step, a randomly chosen individual evaluates\nits sucess. It compares this payo\u001b with a second, randomly chosen individual. If\nthis second individual has a higher payo\u001b, the \u001crst one switches strategies with\nprobability p > 21 . Otherwise, it switches with p < 12 . We assume that the switching\nprobability is given by the Fermi distribution. Its shape is controlled by the intensity\nof selection \u03b2 , which can be interpreted as an inverse temperature,\np\u00b1\ni =\n\n1\n1 + e\u2213\u03b2(\u03c0A (i)\u2212\u03c0B (i))\n\n=\n\n1\n1 + e\u2213\u03b2\u2206\u03c0(i)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nIn previous work [30, 31, 32], there is a di\u001berent strategy update procedure. The\n\u001crst individual switches to the second's strategy with probability p\u00b1i . The second\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n5\n\nindividual can also switch to the \u001crst individual's strategy with probability 1 \u2212 p\u00b1i .\nThis yields a factor 2 in the transition probabilities (and, as we will become clear\nlater, a factor 12 in the \u001cxation times). This process also has a proper strong\nselection limit, i. e. it is possible to examine \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. In this latter case we have\np\u00b1\ni \u2192 \u0398(\u2206\u03c0(i)), where \u0398(x) is the step function.\nThe population size is constant in time, in each time step the state of the system\ncan at most change by one, i. e. from i to i\u22121 or to i+1. The transition probabilities\nTi\u00b1 to move from i to i \u00b1 1 are\nTi\u00b1 =\n\ni N \u2212i \u00b1\npi .\nN N\n\n(8)\n\nThe probability to stay in the current state is 1 \u2212 Ti+ \u2212 Ti\u2212 . An important measure\nof where the system is more likely to move is their ratio,\nTi\u2212\n\u03b3i = + = e\u2212\u03b2 \u2206\u03c0(i) .\nTi\n\n(9)\n\nThis is a quantity that describes the tendency to move from the state i to i \u2213 1,\ndepending on whether \u03b3i \u2277 1. Of course, Ti+ > 0 is required, which follows from\n\u03b2 < \u221e. The Ti\u00b1 and thus the \u03b3i are invariant under adding a value to each of the\npayo\u001bs given in (1), whereas multiplying the payo\u001b matrix with a factor \u03bb results in\na change in the intensity of selection \u03b2\u0303 = \u03b2 \u03bb.\nLet us now focus on weak selection, \u03b2 \u001c 1. In this case we have\np\u00b1\ni \u2248\n\n1 \u03b2\n\u00b1 \u2206\u03c0(i).\n2 4\n\n(10)\n\nWeak selection corresponds to high temperature in Fermi statistics. A Taylor\nexpansion of the \u03b3i up to \u001crst order in \u03b2 yields \u03b3i \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2206\u03c0(i). In this case,\nthe probability to move from i to i + 1 is very similar to the probability to move\nfrom i to i \u2212 1. Weak selection links the Fermi process to a variety of birth death\nprocesses, cf. [8, 33].\n\n3. Fixation probabilities and \u001cxation times\nFrom equation (8) it follows that the two pure states all A or all B are absorbing,\nT0\u00b1 = TN\u00b1 = 0. In a \u001cnite population, we can calculate the probability \u03c6i that the\nsystem will \u001cxate to the pure state all A, starting with the mixed state i. Obviously,\nwe have \u03c60 = 0 and \u03c6N = 1. For 0 < i < N , there is a balance equation for the\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n6\n\n\u001cxation probabilities, \u03c6i = Ti\u2212 \u03c6i\u22121 + (1 \u2212 Ti+ \u2212 Ti\u2212 )\u03c6i + Ti+ \u03c6i+1 . This recursion leads\nto an expression for the \u001cxation probabilities in terms of the \u03b3i [34, 35, 36],\n\u03c6i =\n\n1+\n1+\n\nPi\u22121 Qk\n\nl=1\nPNk=1\n\u22121 Qk\nk=1\n\nl=1\n\n\u03b3l\n\u03b3l\n\n(11)\n\n,\n\nwhich is valid for any birth death process.\nFor the Fermi process, the exact equation (9) simpli\u001ces matters in an elegant\nway because the products in equation (11) can be solved,\nk\nY\n\n(\n\n\u03b3l = exp \u2212\u03b2\n\nl=1\n\nk\nX\n\n)\n\n\u2206\u03c0(l)\n\nl=1\n\nHence, equation (11) simpli\u001ces to\n\n\u0010u\n\u0011io\nn\nh u\n2\n+v\n. (12)\n= exp \u2212\u03b2 k + k\n2\n2\n\n\b\n\u0002 2u\n\u0003\nu\nexp\n\u2212\u03b2\nk\n+\nk(\n+\nv)\nk=1\n2\n\u03c6i =\n\b\n\u0002 2u\n\u0003 .\nP \u22121\n2 + k( u + v)\nexp\n\u2212\u03b2\nk\n1+ N\nk=1\n2\n2\n1+\n\nPi\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nFor large N , the sums in equation (13) can be approximated by integrals, which\nyields a closed expression for the probabilities \u03c6i [33, 37].\nGeneral expressions for the unconditional and conditional mean exit times\nor average times of \u001cxation, t1 and tA1 , are well known, especially for simple,\ntranslational invariant random walks [26, 27, 38]. A complete derivation for the\naverage times of \u001cxation in \u001cnite systems without translational invariance can be\nfound in [26, 35, 39].\nIn the following, we will focus on the \u001cxation of a single A mutant in a population\nof B . Accordingly, the unconditional and conditional \u001cxation times read\nt1 = \u03c61\n\nk\nN\n\u22121 X\nX\nk=1 l=1\n\nand\ntA\n1\n\n=\n\nN\n\u22121 X\nk\nX\nk=1 l=1\n\nk\n1 Y\n\u03b3m ,\nTl+ m=l+1\n\nk\n\u03c6l Y\n\u03b3m ,\nTl+ m=l+1\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nrespectively. Time is measured in elementary time steps here. Thus, in each time\nstep one reproductive event occurs. In biological contexts, it is often more convenient\nto measure time in generations, such that each individual reproduces once per\ngeneration on average. Time in generations is obtained by dividing the number\nof time steps by the population size N . It is well known that the variance of the\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n7\n\nexit times under weak selection can be large [39], which has important biomedical\nimplications [40]. Nonetheless, here we concentrate on the expectation values and\ndo not address the distribution of the exit times.\n\n4. Neutral selection\nAn important reference case is neutral selection, which results from vanishing\nselection intensity \u03b2 = 0 [41]. Neutral selection is a very general limit, which is\ntypically not a\u001bected by the details of the evolutionary process. For neutral selection\nwe have \u03b3i = 1, that is Ti+ = Ti\u2212 in any state i. However, we still have Ti\u00b1 6= Tj\u00b1\nfor i 6= j , although the system is symmetric, Ti\u00b1 = TN\u00b1\u2212i . This is a di\u001berence to the\nsimple random walk in one dimension, which is invariant with respect to translation\n[29].\nFor the Fermi process, the neutral transition probabilities are\nTi\u00b1\n\n=\n\u03b2=0\n\n1 i N \u2212i\n.\n2N N\n\n(16)\n\nWe have Ti+ = Ti\u2212 , which leads to \u03b3i = 1. From equation (11), it is thus clear that\nthe probability of \u001cxation to A is given by the initial abundance of A,\n\u03c6i\n\n=\n\u03b2=0\n\ni\n.\nN\n\n(17)\n\nFor the neutral unconditional time of \u001cxation t1 we get\nt1\n\n=\n\u03b2=0\n\nN \u22121 k\n1 X X 2 N2\n= 2 N HN \u22121 .\nN k=1 l=1 l(N \u2212 l)\n\n(18)\n\nDetails for this calculation can be found in Appendix A. We introduced the shorthand\nP\nnotation for the harmonic numbers HN \u22121 = Nl=1\u22121 1l , which diverge logarithmically\nwith N . In the same way we can solve\ntA\n1 |\u03b2=0\n\n=\n\nN\n\u22121 X\nk\nX\nk=1 l=1\n\nl 2 N2\n= 2 N (N \u2212 1).\nN l(N \u2212 l)\n\n(19)\n\nFor neutral selection, the conditional average time of \u001cxation of a single mutant\ndiverges quadratically with the system size.\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n8\n\n5. Weak Selection\nIn this section we will calculate the linear corrections of the mean exit times or\n\u001cxation times t1 , and tA1 under weak selection, \u03b2 \u001c 1. Of course, all weak selection\napproximations are valid only if the term linear in \u03b2 is small compared to the constant\nterm.\nThe \u001cxation probabilities for small \u03b2 are\n\u03c6i \u2248\n\ni\n(N + i)u + 3v\ni\n+ (N \u2212 i)\n\u03b2,\nN\nN\n6\n\n(20)\n\nwhich has been derived for a variety of evolutionary processes before [8, 10, 12, 35,\n36, 42].\nNext, we address the weak selection approximation of the \u001cxation times. The\nexpectation value of the unconditional \u001cxation time of a single A mutant in a\npopulation of B is in general given by the exact equation (14). With the the transition\nand \u001cxation probabilities of the Fermi process, the unconditional \u001cxation time of\nabsorption at any boundary simpli\u001ces to\nt1 = \u03c61\n\nk\nN\n\u22121 X\nX\nk=1 l=1\n\n\u0001\nN2\n1 + e\u2212\u03b2(u l+v)\nl(N \u2212 l)\n)\n(\nk\nX\n\u2206\u03c0(m) .\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\u03b2\n\n(21)\n\nm=l+1\n\nThe weak selection approximation takes the remarkably simple form (see Appendix\nB for details)\nt1 \u2248 2 N HN \u22121 + v N (N \u2212 1 \u2212 HN \u22121 ) \u03b2,\n\n(22)\n\nwith v given in (6). Thus, t1 depends only on the constant term of the payo\u001b\ndi\u001berence. For large N , this yields v \u2248 b \u2212 d. That is, for large populations under\nweak selection the linear correction of the average \u001cxation time only depends on\nthe advantage (or disadvantage) of the A mutants in the resident population. For\nb > d, invasion of A mutants is likely and slows down the time until the population\nis homogeneous again. For d > b, it is di\u001ecult for A to invade a B population and\nextinction of the mutants is faster than in the neutral case. Note that the payo\u001b\nentries a and c have no in\u001duence on the unconditional \u001cxation time under weak\nselection corrections. Since \u001cxation is unlikely for weak selection (the probability of\n\u001cxation of a single A mutant is approximately N \u22121 ), the unconditional \u001cxation time\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n9\n\nis dominated by the \u001cxation to B . In this case, it is enough to discuss the invasion\nof A mutants.\nNext, we address the average time to \u001cxation given that the A mutant takes\nover the population. With the general result (15) the Fermi processes conditional\n\u001cxation time to all A reads\ntA\n1 =\n\nN\n\u22121 X\nk\nX\nk=1 l=1\n\n\u03c6l\n\n\u0001\nN2\n1 + e\u2212\u03b2(u l+v)\nl(N \u2212 l)\n(\n)\nk\nX\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\u03b2\n\u2206\u03c0(m) .\n\n(23)\n\nm=1+l\n\nIts linear approximation turns out to be dependent on the payo\u001bs in a very simple\nway as well,\ntA\n1 \u2248 2 N (N \u2212 1) \u2212 u N (N \u2212 1)\n\nN2 + N \u2212 6\n\u03b2,\n18\n\n(24)\n\nwith u(N \u2212 1) = a \u2212 b \u2212 c + d. The detailed calculation can be found in Appendix\nB. Since during the \u001cxation process all payo\u001bs are of importance, it is obvious that\nthey all enter here. For example, when it is easy to invade because few mutants\nhave an advantage (b > d), but di\u001ecult to reach \u001cxation because mutants are\ndisadvantageous once they are frequent (c > a), we have u < 0 and the conditional\ntime to \u001cxation is larger than neutral. In the last section, we discuss special classes of\ngames to show that, under weak selection, the conditional mean exit times of \u001cxation\n(or absorption) do not always follow the intuition based on the payo\u001b matrix (1).\n\n6. Frequency dependent Moran process\nIn this section we address the generality of the previous \u001cndings discussing an\nalternative evolutionary process. The \u001crst model that connects payo\u001bs from a 2 \u00d7 2\ngame to reproductive \u001ctness using a weak selection approach in \u001cnite populations\nis the frequency dependent Moran process [8, 9]. In this process, an individual is\nchosen for reproduction with probability proportional to its \u001ctness f (i). The o\u001bspring\nreplaces a randomly chosen individual. The average payo\u001bs (2) and (3) are mapped\nto the \u001ctness such that fA (i) = 1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b2 \u03c0A (i) and fB (i) = 1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b2 \u03c0B (i), where\nthe selcetion intensity \u03b2 > 0 is so small that fA (i) > 0 and fB (i) > 0. The transition\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n10\n\nprobabilities of the standard Moran process read\nifA (i)\nN \u2212i\n,\nifA (i) + (N \u2212 i)fB (i) N\ni\n(N \u2212 i)fB (i)\n.\n=\nifA (i) + (N \u2212 i)fB (i) N\n\nTi+ =\n\n(25)\n\nTi\u2212\n\n(26)\n\nAlthough these transition probabilities are di\u001berent from those of the Fermi process,\nQ\nP\nthey also yield \u03b3i \u2248 1 \u2212 \u2206\u03c0(i) and km=l+1 \u03b3m \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03b2 km=l+1 \u2206\u03c0(m) for\nweak selection, \u03b2 \u001c 1. Thus, the weak selection approximations of the \u001cxation\nprobabilities \u03c6l of the Moran process and the Fermi process are identical, see equation\n(20). But the weak selection approximation of the transition probabilities are not\nidentical, which leads consequently to di\u001berent mean exit times. Nevertheless, the\nresults have the same, remarkably simple connection to the payo\u001b matrix (1). The\nmean exit times or \u001cxation times of the frequency dependent Moran process are\nN\n(N + 1 \u2212 2HN ) \u03b2,\n2\nN 2 (N 2 \u2212 3N + 2)\ntA\n\u2248\nN\n(N\n\u2212\n1)\n\u2212\nu\n\u03b2.\n1\n36\nt1 \u2248 N HN \u22121 + v\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nQualitatively, the dependence on the payo\u001b matrix via u and v is the same as for the\nFermi process. Their calculation is analogous to the \u001cndings of the previous section,\ndetails can be found in Appendix B. Note that, comparing with the Fermi process,\nthere is a factor of 2 missing in the neutral terms. However, this can be avoided by\nrescaling the transition probabilities, without changing the properties of the di\u001berent\nprocesses.\n\n7. Discussion\nFinally, let us discuss the implications of our results for general 2 \u00d7 2 games. While\nwe concentrate on the Fermi process here, the discussion is equally valid for the\nfrequency dependent Moran process. An important question is whether the linear\ncorrection for weak selection is compatible with the general features of the game and\nthe known asymptotic behavior for large N of the mean exit or \u001cxation times derived\nby Antal and Scheuring [26]. Clearly, this depends on the payo\u001b matrix of the 2 \u00d7 2\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n11\n\ngame,\nA\nB\n\nA B!\na b\n,\nc d\n\n(29)\n\nas the payo\u001bs enter the \u001crst exit times of absorption linearly. To analyze the\ndi\u001berence to the neutral case we consider the rescaled average times of \u001cxation,\nA\n\u03c41 (\u03b2) = t1 (\u03b2)/t1 (0) and \u03c41A (\u03b2) = tA\n1 (\u03b2)/t1 (0). The rescaled unconditional \u001cxation\ntime reads\n1 N (b \u2212 d) \u2212 a + d\n\u03c41 \u2248 1 +\n2\nN \u22121\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nN \u22121\n\u2212 1 \u03b2.\nHN \u22121\n\n(30)\n\nAccordingly, the rescaled conditional \u001cxation time for absorption at all A is\na \u2212 b \u2212 c + d N2 + N \u2212 6\n\u03b2.\n(31)\nN \u22121\n36\nNote that for population sizes N > 2 and su\u001eciently small \u03b2 , we always have t1 (0) <\ntA\n1 (0). In other words, the average time until the A individual has reached \u001cxation\nor gone extinct is smaller than the conditional average time until the A individual\nhas reached \u001cxation. For \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, the process follows deterministically the intensity\nof selection and thus both \u001cxation times may coincide, t1 (\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e) \u2248 tA1 (\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e).\n\u03c41A \u2248 1 \u2212\n\nThis ordering of the \u001cxation times is blurred by our rescaling, as we focus only on\nthe change relative to the neutral case.\nIn the following, we discuss these two expressions for the three generic types of\n2 \u00d7 2 games, namely dominance of A (a > c and b > d), coexistence of A and B\n(a < b and c > d) and a coordination game (a > c and b < d).\n7.1. Dominance of\n\nA.\n\nConsider a game where strategy A is always dominant, i. e. it obtains a larger payo\u001b\nthan B , regardless of the fraction of A in the population. This is the case for a > c\nand b > d. One special case is the Prisoner's Dilemma with b > d > a > c.\nThe interesting feature of this game is that the social optimum d is not the Nash\nequilibrium, which is a. For neutral selection, a single A individual goes extinct with\nprobability 1 \u2212 N \u22121 . Thus, the unconditional \u001cxation time \u03c41 is dominated by the\nextinction of A. Since strategy A is favored by selection, increasing the intensity\nof selection decreases the probability of the extinction of A. Since \u001cxation takes\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n12\n\nat least N \u2212 1 time steps, \u03c41 increases with increasing intensity of selection \u03b2 . For\nlarge N , this is obvious from our equation (30), because in this case the quantity\nN (b\u2212d)\u2212a+d is positive. However, once extinction of A becomes unlikely, increasing\n\u03b2 further will lead to a decrease of \u03c41 .\nThe discussion of the conditional \u001cxation time \u03c41A is not as straightforward,\nbecause the sign of a \u2212 b \u2212 c + d can be positive or negative. The sign of this\nquantity is also decisive for the evolutionary dynamics in other contexts, see e.g.\n[43]. When the advantage of an A individual is initially large and decreases with\nthe abundance of A (a \u2212 c > b \u2212 d > 0), then the sign of a \u2212 b \u2212 c + d is positive\nand \u03c41A decreases with increasing intensity of selection. But when the advantage\nof strategy A decreases with the number of A individuals (b \u2212 d > a \u2212 c > 0),\nthen \u03c41A increases with increasing intensity of selection. However, this apparently\ncounterintuitive phenomenon (after all, A dominates B ) can only be observed for\nweak selection. For strong selection, \u03c41A decreases again. These results are compatible\nwith the observation that the conditional \u001cxation time scales as N ln N for large N\n[26]. In Figure 2 (a) we show a numerical example for the rescaled average times. We\ninclude averages from numerical simulations of the evolutionary process, our linear\napproximation as well as the exact result that can be obtained from dividing equation\n(14) by (18) and equation (15) by (19), respectively. The payo\u001b matrix is chosen\nsuch that a + d > b + c, which means that with increasing intensity of selection \u03c41A\ndecreases and \u03c41 increases.\n7.2. Coexistence of\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB.\n\nAs a second class, we consider games in which B is the best reply to A (c > a), but\nA is the best reply to B (b > d). Important examples for such games are the HawkDove game [44] or the Snowdrift game [45]. For in\u001cnite populations, the replicator\ndynamics predicts a stable coexistence of A and B . In \u001cnite populations, the system\ntypically \u001ductuates around that point until eventually, \u001ductuations lead to absorption\nin one the boundaries [46, 47]. Consequently, the conditional \u001cxation times increase\nexponentially with the population size [26]. Since a \u2212 b \u2212 c + d is negative, we\nalso have an increase of \u03c41A with the selection intensity for weak selection. Further,\nN (b \u2212 d) \u2212 a + d is positive in large populations, such that also \u03c41 increases with\nthe selection intensity. Figure 2 (b) shows that the divergence of the exact results is\nfaster than the linear approximation even for weak selection.\n\n\fFixation times in evolutionary games under weak selection\n\n13\n\n7.3. Coordination games.\n\nFinally, let us discuss coordination games in which a > c and b < d. In these games,\nA is the best reply to A and B is the best reply to B . The replicator equation of\nsuch systems exhibits a bistability: If the fraction of A individuals is su\u001eciently high\nin the beginning, the A individuals will reach \u001cxation. Otherwise, B individuals\nwill take over the system. The stronger the intensity of selection, the less likely it\nis that a single A individual can take over a B population. Consequently, \u03c41 should\ndecrease with \u03b2 . This also follows from our weak selection approximation: In large\npopulations, N (b \u2212 d) \u2212 a + d is negative and thus \u03c41 decreases with the intensity of\nselection, see equation (30). Perhaps less intuitive, also \u03c41A decreases with \u03b2 , which\nresults from a \u2212 b \u2212 c + d > 0, cf. (30). However, this is again consistent with the\nobservation that \u03c41A scales as N ln N in large populations. Although the \u001cxation\nprobability of a single A decreases with \u03b2 , if such an event occurs, it is faster than\nin the neutral case. A numerical example for this behavior is shown in Figure 2 (c).\nThe numerical examples indicate that the convergence radius of our weak\nselection expansion is of the order of N \u22121 , which is also known for many systems in\npopulation genetics. Although N \u22121 might appear small, this kind of weak selection\nis the most relevant limit in evolutionary biology, as evolutionary change is typically\nonly connected with small selective di\u001berences. We stress that we have made no\nassumptions on the population size, such that our results are valid for arbitrary N .\nOur approach shows under which circumstances the general features of the game\nare re\u001dected in the \u001cxation times under weak selection.
