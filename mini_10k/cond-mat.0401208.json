We find that this phase transition, in two space dimensions,\nis always discontinuous, including for the minimal model of Vicsek et al. [Phys. Rev.

Whereas biologists\ntend to build detailed representations of a particular case,\nthe ubiquity of the phenomenon suggests underlying universal features and thus gives weight to the bottom-up\nmodeling approach usually favored by physicists [7].\nIn this respect, the simple model introduced by Vicsek\nand collaborators [8] stands out because of its minimal\ncharacter and the a priori least-favorable conditions in\nwhich it is defined. In the Vicsek model (VM), identical\npointwise particles move at constant velocity and interact locally by trying to align their direction with that of\nneighbors. Remarkably, even in the presence of noise and\nin the absence of leaders and global forces, orientational\nlong-range order arises, i.e. collective motion emerges, if\nthe density of particles is high enough or, equivalently, if\nthe noise is weak enough. The existence of the ordered\nphase was later \"proved\" by a renormalisation-group approach based on a phenomenological mesoscopic equation [9]. More recently, this work was extended to the\ncase where the ambient fluid is taken into full account,\nyielding novel mesoscopic equations for suspensions of\nself-propelled particles [10].\nThe nature of the non-equilibrium phase transition\nto collective motion, however, is not well established.\nVicsek et al. concluded from numerical simulations in\ntwo and three dimensions that it is continuous (\"secondorder\") and characterized by a set of critical indices, but\nthese results remain somewhat crude [11], even though\nthe undeniably minimal character of the VM makes it a\ngood candidate for representing a universality class.\nMoreover, from a modeling point of view, an often desirable ingredient missing in the VM is cohesion: when\nput together in an infinite space, particles do not stay together and fly apart. In other words, no collective motion\nis possible in the zero-density limit of the VM. Recently,\nwe have shown how one can ensure cohesion in simple\nmodels derived from the VM without resorting to leader\n\nparticles or long-range or global forces [12].\nIn this Letter, we study the onset of collective motion\nwith and without cohesion in this very general setting,\ntrying to assess the universality of the results of Vicsek\net al. In both cases, we find that the onset of collective motion in the VM and related models is actually\ndiscontinuous (\"first-order\") and that its apparent continuous character is due to strong finite-size effects. We\nalso show that without cohesion, the transition point is\nnevertheless accompanied by a non-trivial superdiffusive\nbehavior of particles which, we argue, could be measured\nexperimentally. In the presence of cohesion, our study\nreveals that the onset of collective motion is the theater\nof a complex interplay between density, velocity, sound\nand shape modes, giving rise to fascinating dynamics.\nThe original VM is defined as follows: identical pointwise particles move synchronously at discrete timesteps\n\u2206t = 1 by a fixed distance v0 . In two space dimensions -to which we restrict ourselves in the following-\nthe direction of motion of particle j is just an angle \u03b8j ,\ncalculated from the previous directions of all particles k\nwithin an interaction range r0 = 1 > v0 \u2206t:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX t\n\u03b8jt+1 = arg \uf8f0\n(1)\nei\u03b8k \uf8fb + \u03b7 \u03bejt ,\nk\u223cj\n\nwhere \u03bejt is a delta-correlated white noise (\u03be \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]).\nThis introduces a tendency to align with neighboring particles, with two simple limits: in the absence of noise,\ninteracting particles align perfectly, quickly leading to\ncomplete orientational order. For maximal noise (\u03b7 = 1),\nparticles follow random walks. The transition that necessarily lies in between these two regimes can be characterized by the following instantaneous order parameter:\n\n\u03c6t \u2261\n\nN\n1 X i\u03b8jt\ne\nN j=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N is the total number of particles.\nVarying either the noise strength \u03b7 or the particle density \u03c1 = N/L2 in periodic domains of linear size L, Vicsek et al. found that h\u03c6i varies continuously across the\n\n\f2\n(a)\n1\n\n(b)\n0.8\n\n<\u03c6>\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n1\n\n1 G\n\nG\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c6\u22a5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b7\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0\n0.8 0.2\n\n\u03b7\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n-3\n0.12\n\ntransition, suggesting the existence of a critical point [8].\nStudying finite-size effects, they estimated a set of scaling exponents. Interested in assessing the universality\nof these results and possibly improving these estimates,\nwe first introduced simple modifications of the original\nVM such as changing v0 or adding a repulsive force between particles to give them a finite extent. Using the\nfinite-size scaling Ansatz appropriate for XY-model like\nsystems, domain sizes, and particle numbers similar to\nthose used in [8], but with much better, well-controlled\nstatistics, we were only able to estimate a roughly coherent set of critical exponents after allowing for rather\nstrong corrections to scaling [13].\nFor modeling reasons, we also changed the way noise\nis incorporated in the system. In (1), particles make an\nerror when trying to take the new direction they have\nperfectly calculated (\"angular noise\"). One could argue\nthat, rather, errors are made when estimating the interactions, for example because of a noisy environment.\nThis leads to change Eq.(1) into, e.g.:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX t\nt\n\u03b8jt+1 = arg \uf8f0\nei\u03b8k + \u03b7 ntj ei\u03bej \uf8fb\n(3)\nk\u223cj\n\nwhere ntj is the current number of neighbors of particle\nj. In this case of \"vectorial noise\", the onset of collective\nmotion is discontinuous: for large-enough system sizes,\nh\u03c6i jumps abruptly to zero as \u03b7 is decreased, whereas\nit varies smoothly in the original VM (Fig. 1a). This\nis perhaps best seen from the behavior of the so-called\nBinder cumulant G = 1 \u2212 h\u03c64 i/3h\u03c62 i2 (Fig. 1b). In the\ncase of vectorial noise, G falls to negative values near \u03b7c ,\nthe sign of a discontinuous transition, together with the\nphase coexistence expected then.\nGoing from angular to vectorial noise is indeed a\nless innocent modification than those mentioned earlier:\nin model (3), locally-ordered regions are subjected to\nweaker noise than disordered ones.

(d) snapshot of coarse-grained\ndensity field in disordered phase at threshold, \u03c1 = 2, L = 256.\nThe arrows indicate the direction of motion of dense, ordered\nregions.\n\nchange the order of the transition upon introducing this\nnonlinear term. Considering in addition the strong corrections to scaling found with angular noise, we strived\nto reach larger system sizes in some of these cases, albeit\nat the cost of statistical accuracy [13]. The conclusion of\nthese numerical efforts is that the transition is discontinuous in all cases, with finite-size effects being somewhat\nweaker at low densities. As an example, the behavior of\nG with increasing system size shown in Fig. 2a for the\noriginal VM at \u03c1 = 18 reveals the characteristic fall to\nnegative values. The distribution function of \u03c6t is bimodal around threshold, without any intermediate unimodal regime (Fig. 2c). Thus, the continuous transition\nreported by Vicsek et al. is only apparent.\nIn the ordered phase, the particles are organized in\ndensity waves moving steadily in a disordered \"vapour\npressure\" background of well-defined asymptotic density\n(Fig. 2b). These solitary waves become metastable to a\nlong-wavelength longitudinal instability below the density threshold \u03b7c (defined to be located at the minimum\nof G), leading to an hysteresis loop. At threshold and below, the disordered phase consists of nucleated ordered\npatches competing in space and time (Fig. 2d).\nAt threshold, in the disordered phase, a universal nontrivial algebraic scaling law is nevertheless found: the\n\n\f3\nsuperdiffusive behavior of particles already reported by\nus in [14] is valid in all cases. Trajectories then consist of \"flights\", occuring when a particle is caught in a\nmoving ordered patch, separated by normal diffusion in\nthe disordered regions. The mean square displacement\nof particles h\u03b4r2 i varies like t\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1.65(5).\nWe now turn to the onset of collective motion in the\npresence of cohesion. As shown in [12], the cohesion of\na population of particles can be maintained without resolving to long-range or global interactions. In the spirit\nof the VM, and following [15], a two-body short-range\ninteraction force competing with the alignment tendency\nis introduced, leading to the following model:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX t\nX\nt\nt\nt i\u03b8jk\n\u03b8jt+1 = arg \uf8f0\u03b1\nei\u03b8k + \u03b2\nfjk\ne\n+ \u03b7 ntj ei\u03bej \uf8fb (4)\nk\u223cj\n\nk\u223cj\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 control the strength of alignment and\nt\ncohesion, \u03b8jk\nis the direction of the vector linking particle\nj to particle k. The interaction force between these two\nt\nparticles, of amplitude fjk\n, is actually repulsive up to an\nintermediate equilibrium distance re , with a short-range\nhard-core at rc and attractive up to the interaction range\nr0 . In the following, as in [12], we used:\n\uf8f1\nif rjk < rc ,\n\uf8f2 \u2212\u221e\n1 rjk \u2212re\nif rc < rjk < ra ,\n(5)\nfjk =\n\uf8f3 4 ra \u2212re\n1\nif ra < rjk < r0 .\nwhere rjk is the distance between j and k, with rc =\n0.2, re = 0.5, and ra = 0.8. Note that vectorial noise\nwas chosen in (4), in the hope of reaching asymptotic\nproperties more easily.\nThe above model has three main parameters, \u03b1, \u03b2,\nand \u03b7, only two of which are independent. The phase\ndiagram in the (\u03b1, \u03b2) plane (with \u03b7 = 1 fixed arbitrarily)\nwas presented in [12], where, moreover, only neighbors in\nthe Voronoi sense are considered in the sums of (4)). For\nlarge-enough \u03b2, cohesion is maintained, even in the zerodensity limit. This \"gas/liquid\" transition is followed, at\nlarger \u03b2 values, by the onset of positional (quasi-) order,\ni.e. a \"liquid/solid\" transition. For large \u03b1, these liquid\nor solid cohesive groups move, whereas they remain static\n(up to finite-size fluctuations) for small \u03b1.\nIn the \"liquid case\" (intermediate \u03b2 values), the onset of motion is accompanied by a loss of cohesion: while\nsmall groups set in motion smoothly without breaking up\n(Fig. 3a, dashed lines), larger groups gradually subdivide\ninto several parts of roughly equivalent size linked by filamentary structures, in contrast with their more compact\nshapes before and after onset (Fig. 4). The filaments\nthemselves are quite static (Fig. 4d) but are displaced by\nthe subgroups which move coherently so that they eventually break up, as indicated by the dip in the normalized\nlargest connected cluster size n/N in Fig. 3a. Increasing\n\u03b1, large groups follow the same precursor of the transition as smaller groups, but when their fragmentation\n\n(a)\n1\n\n(b)\n\n<\u03c6>,<n/N>\n\n3\n\n\u03c9,<\u03c6>\u00d74\nln(PDF)\n\n1 <\u03c6>,< \u2206 >\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nln trot\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2.4\n\n\u03b1\n\n2.5\n\n0\n1.6\n\n9\n\n\u03b1\n1.8\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: Onset of motion of cohesive groups in model (4)\nwith \u03b7 = 1, v0 = 0.05.

Inset: distribution of rotation times at\nthe transition with decay exponent \u223c 1.3.\n\noccurs the order parameter falls back, leaving an intermediate peak (around \u03b1 = 1.7 in Fig. 3a). Increasing \u03b1\nfurther, h\u03c6i rises again and finally jumps to h\u03c6i = 1 when\nfull cohesion is recovered (for \u03b1 = 1.88 in Fig. 3a). This\ndiscontinuous jump is the true location of the transition:\nFor an infinite group, the onset of motion must occur\nabruptly near this value, as the precursory features described above disappear because the population divides\ninto infinitely-many subgroups whose influences average\nthemselves out. Meanwhile, cohesion is only lost at the\ntransition point in this asymptotic picture.\nThe breakup of large cohesive groups around threshold\nis probably closely related to what happens in the case\nwithout cohesion: the subgroups connected by filaments\nmay correspond to the ordered patches seen in the disordered phase near threshold in Fig. 2d. The breakup\nitself can be seen as resulting from the maximal effect\nof acoustic modes on the shape of the group [13]. Also\naffecting the shape dynamics are rotational modes: the\nsubgroups seen in Fig. 4a not only move but they also\nrotate slowly [16]. Rotation is not steady, but intermittent. We recorded the rotation times and their corresponding angles. Extremal statistics analysis reveal that\nthe tendency to rotate is maximal at the onset of motion\n(Fig. 3b). Moreover, at threshold, the distribution of rotation times is algebraic with a decay exponent such that\nit has no finite mean (inset of Fig. 3b).\nThe onset of motion of the \"solid\" groups (large \u03b2 values) is accompanied by a loss of positional order: these\ncrystals melt near the transition (inset of Fig. 3a). Given\nthe above results in the liquid case, one can expect very\n\n\f4\nassays\" consisting of grafted molecular motors such as\nkinesin (resp. myosin) moving filaments made of tubulin\n(resp. actin) might provide the simplest setting in which\nto investigate superdiffusion at onset, given the available\nobservation techniques [5, 6].\n\nFIG. 4: Typical shape of a liquid cohesive group of 16384\n1\nparticles (model (4), \u03c1 = 16\n, \u03b2 = 20 arrows indicate direction\nof motion).

(d): close-up of a\nfilament: no local order is apparent.\n\nlarge solid groups to melt and then subdivide and lose\ncohesion in the transition region, making the onset of\nmotion asymptotically discontinuous.\nTo summarize, the onset of collective motion in the VM\nas well as in related models with and without cohesion is\nalways discontinuous, and the critical behavior reported\nin [8] is only apparent and due to (strong) finite-size effects. Without cohesion, the ordered phase consists in\ndensity waves propagating steadily in a disordered background. With a short-range repulsion/attraction interaction, the cohesion ensured both in the disordered and\nordered phases is broken at the onset of motion under the\ncompeting influence of sound, density, and shape modes.\nThe resulting mesoscopic subgroups are linked by filaments which, however, we believe to be probably nonuniversal, model-dependent structures.\nAt the theoretical level, ongoing work is directed towards the understanding of the complex interplay between shape (surface tension) and acoustic modes, and\nof the stability properties of the density waves. At the\nexperimental level, it remains difficult to study quantitatively bird flocks and fish schools, and moreover we\nhave no specific prediction as to the onset of motion of\nthese cohesive groups [17]. Without cohesion, however,\nthe universal superdiffusive behavior observed in the disordered phase near threshold could be observed experimentally. As already suggested in [14], bacteria such as\nE. Coli might be good self-propelled particles. Human\nmelanocytes also look promising in this respect as shown\nremarkably by the group of Gruler [4]. Finally, \"motility\n\n[1] See, e.g.: D.
