Specifically,\nself-assembled quantum dots (QDs) grown by StranskiKrastanov method1 have attracted great attention from\nthe scientific community2,3 . A lot of works have been\ndevoted to the study of the electronic and optical properties of QDs where their shape are modeled as quantum\npyramids4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 . It has been also considered QDs\nhaving lens shape12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 . In this case,\nthere is a rather extended opinion which states that the\nwork done considering QDs with pyramids shapes can\nbe straightforward applied to characterize the QDs with\nlens shape and therefore, the calculation made in pyramids QDs does not need to be re-calculated in quantum\nlenses. Nevertheless, different authors have shown the\nimportance to consider the full lens geometry for a better\ndescription of the optical properties of the QDs21,22,23,24 .\nPhotoluminescence (PL) measurement under high hydrostatic pressure has been proveed to be an effective\ntool for exploring the electronic structure and optical\ntransitions in QDs25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 . It is reported a\nsignificant decreasing in the hydrostatic pressure coefficient (PC) for InAs/GaAs QDs in comparison with bulk\nmaterial. Different experimental works have proposed\nsome explanations: non-uniform Indium distribution in\nthe QDs33 , pressure dependence of the effective masses\nand confined potential32 , and the necessity to include\na nonlinear strain distribution26 and band-gap pressure\ndependence and finite barriers34 . From the theoretical\npoint of view some works have been devoted to explain\nthe obtained low value of hydrostatic PC. For example,\nelasticity theory in Ref. 25, atomistic empirical pseudopotential method in Ref. 28 and atomistic valence-force\nfield method in Ref. 27 were implemented. In all of the\nformer works, the QDs have been modeled as quantum\npyramids.\nThe motivation of the presente work is focused on the\n\nexperimental observations of Ref. 26,29,30,31. They\nhave performed studies of low-temperature PL in InAs\nand InGaAs self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) embedded in GaAs matrix under hydrostatic pressure.\nFrom the pressure dependence of the main electron-hole\ntransition energy, a pressure coefficient 20% smaller that\nthe InAs case was reported. In Refs. 25 and 29 some arguments could explain this difference in the pressure coefficients: (i) the change of the band offset between InAs\nand GaAs, (ii) the strong tension in the InAs SAQD material and, (iii) the lowering of the electron and light-hole\nquantization energies due to the change of the effective\nmasses with pressure.\nIn Ref. 31 was argued that the dots can be characterized by a lens symmetry with a base between 7.5 and\n10.6 nm of radius and ratio height/radius between 0.28\nand 0.4. We need to appoint that, in general, the shape\nand dimensions of the InAs/GaAs SAQDs are not always\nwell determined and a degree of freedom remains.\nAn attempt to describe the PL peak energies can be\nfound in Ref. 35 where the spatial confined geometry was\nmodelled as a parabolic cylinder potential avoiding the\nspecific geometry of the SAQDs. It is well known that different geometries yield different results, as shown in Ref.\n24 when comparing the electronic properties between a\ncylindrical and a lens shape SAQD. In this paper, the QD\nwill be modeled by a full lens symmetry with maximum\nheight b and circular cross section of radius a with b < a.\nIt is implemented a model which allows the inclusion of\nthe finite barrier effect in SAQD with lens shape. The\nmodel allows to validate the importance of the change\nof the band offset and electron-hole effective masses as a\nfunction of pressure on the PL spectra. In our simulation the strain effect within the QD has been taking into\naccount through an effective linear pressure coefficient at\nzero temperature which consider the built-in strain of the\ndot by assuming a simple two-dimensional strained layers\nmodel (see Table I and Refs. 32,35,36). The QDs considered here are within the strong confinement regime and\nas first approximation the excitonic effects are ignored.\n\n\f2\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection II deals with the general trends of the simulation\nfor including the hydrostatic pressure in QDs characterized by a lens geometry with a short discussion of the\nmodel used to obtain the electronic spectrum. Section\nIII presents theoretical calculations for the system comparing the effect of the hydrostatic pressure over different\nquantum lenses. A comparison with available PL data of\nthe main transition energy as a function of P is presented\nin Sec. IV. Finally, section V is devoted to the conclusions.\nII.\n\nThe fractional change in volume in the InAs domain is\ngiven by\n(1)\n\nwhere S11 = 1.946 \u00d7 10\u22123 kbar\u22121 and S12 = \u22126.855 \u00d7\n10\u22124 kbar\u22121 are the compliance constants35 . The energy\ngap Eg at low temperature at the \u0393 point is proportional\nto the pressure according to\nEg (P, T ) = Eg(o) + \u03b1 P \u2212\n\n\u03baT2\n,\nT +c\n\nC1\n\na\n\u2206\n\n2\u2206\nR\n\n-R\n\nare function of the pressure. The energy levels at a given\nband are characterized by the radial label N with axial projection of the angular momentum with quantum\nnumber m. Then, in the framework of the parabolic band\nmodel, the transition energy ENe ,me ;Nh ,mh means the energy difference between the states (Nh , mh ) and (Ne , me )\nin the valence and conduction bands, respectively. The\nOscillator Strength (OS) is given by38 :\nd(Ne , me ; Nh , mh ) =\n\nfor electrons,\n(4)\n\nfor light holes and\n(5)\n\nfor the heavy holes. Here Eg is the gap energy given by\nEq. (2), \u03b31 and \u03b32 are the Luttinger parameters, \u03b4 is\nthe spin-orbit splitting and mo is the free electron mass.\nThe parameter Po is the interband momentum matrix\nelement between the conduction and valence bands.\nThe PL lines in such QDs structures are proportional\nto the optical transition energies ENe ,me ;Nh ,mh (P ) which\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u03a8Ne ,me ;Nh ,mh (r, r)dr .

For the case of InAs/GaAs SAQD, the\nparameters used for both materials are shown in Table\nI. With the inclusion of the finite stress it can be seen\nthat the \u03b1 coefficient is greater for the GaAs material\nthan the InAs. Hence, the confined potential for the\nconduction and valence bands will increase with pressure.\nThe variation of the effective masses was evaluated in\nterms of the fundamental gaps according to the Kane\nmodel and it was obtained37\n\u0012 2\u0013\nEg + 32 \u03b4\nPo\nmo\n=\n1\n+\n2\n,\n(3)\nm\u2217e\nmo Eg (Eg + \u03b4)\n\n\u0014\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\n4\nmo\nPo\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\u2212\n,\n\u2217\nmlh\n3 Eg mo\n\nC2\n\nDout\n\nFIG. 1: Transversal section of a 3D lens Din in a semispherical\nmedium Dout with contours C2 and C1 respectively.

The\nintegration is over the whole domain D of the QD.\nA.\n\nElectronic structure\n\nAlthough previous theoretical studies in QDs with lens\nshape38,39,40 considered infinite potential wall, the finite\nvalue of the band offset is a fundamental parameter when\nconsidering the hydrostatic pressure, as can be seen from\nEq. (2). Then, in our case, the problem for a finite barrier will be modelled including a lens-shape well potential\nwith height Vo in a hard-walls semi-spherical region, as\nshown in Fig. 1. The semi-spherical region is divided in\ntwo regions, Din and Dout with confined potential zero\nand Vo , respectively, and the mismatch boundary conditions are considered at the interface. Assuming parabolic\nband dispersion for electron and holes, the solution of the\neffective mass equation for a lens geometry, with finite\nbarrier, in an infinite surrounding medium can be obtained by minimizing the effect of the external boundary\nC1 over the wavefunction of the corresponding energy\nlevel under study. This can be achieved taken larger\nenough value of the distance \u2206. The equation for the\nwhole region D is:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\u03042\n1\n\u2212 \u2207\n\u2207\u03a8 + V (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u03a8 = E \u03a8, (7)\n2\nm\u2217 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n\f3\n(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2208 D = Din + Dout ,\n\n0 ; (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2208 Din\nVo ; (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2208 Dout\n\nand\nm\u2217 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u001a\n\nThe analytical solution of Eq. (7) is sought in the\nclosed form\nX\n(o)\n(8)\nCi \u03a8i ,\n\u03a8=\ni\n\n(o)\n{\u03a8i }\n\nis a complete set of\nwhere the set of functions\nfunctions in the 3D domain D determined by the semisphere and its explicit representation can be found in\nRef. 39. With the former expansion the functions \u03a8\nsatisfy the boundary condition of infinite barrier in the\ncontour C1 because the set of functions {\u03a8(o) } does. On\nthe other hand, Eq. (7) and the corresponding solution\ngiven by Eq. (8) are written for the whole domain D. It\nguarantees that the matching conditions at the contour\nC2 are also satisfied, but only at those points where it\nis well-defined the derivative of the wavefunction. This\ndoes not occur at the corners of the contour C2 where\nthe differentiation with respect to the normal to the surface presents a discontinuity and, generally speaking, the\nproblem is then not well-defined41 . The obtained eigenvalues constitute only an estimation of the solution for\nthe real problem but we accept this solution as a better one than the values reported by the infinite barrier\ncase. The present formalism has been applied in previous\nworks42 , but not explicit analysis has been done about\nthe method used and the fulfillment of the matching conditions between the internal and the external domain.\nIn order to visualize the results of the above described model, two different quantum lens geometries of\nInAs/GaAs have been considered. In Fig. 2 are shown\nthe first five electronic levels as a function of the lens\nradius. Panel a) is for b/a = 0.91 while panel b) is for\nb/a = 0.51. The levels calculated within the hard wall\nmodel39 are shown by dotted lines while the results obtained using the finite barrier model are described by\nsolid lines. For the finite barrier case, it has been used a\n500 \u00d7 500 matrix and a value of \u2206/R = 0.3 to guarantees that the absolute and relative errors introduced by\nthe contour C1 and the cut-off of Eq. (8) in the values\nobtained for the energy levels are less than 10\u22123 . According to the results of the Fig. 2, it can be seen that\nthe infinite barrier is a good approximation for radius of\nthe order of 20 nm or higher when b/a = 0.91. As b/a\ndecreases, the values of the energy levels increase and the\neffects of the finite barrier become important.

In both panels the confined potential energy it is shown by dashed lines.\n\nheight of the potential barrier Vo = Vc as a function\nof the pressure by dashed lines. The band offset of the\nstrained InAs/GaAs quantum lens was taken, for the conduction (valence) band, as 54% (46%) of the total band\ndifference35 .\nIt is interesting to note the decreasing of the values of\nthe conduction energies levels with the increasing of P ,\nin spite of the increasing of the barrier height according\nto Eq. (2) and the decreasing of the dot radius following\nEq. (1). This effect is very robust for both configurations\nshown in Fig. 3. This fact is a direct consequence of the\nstrong influence of the variation of the electron mass with\nP according to Eq. (3). The same will happen for the\nlight hole (see Eq. (4)). In the case of Fig. 3 b), due to\nthe strong lens deformation, only two electron states are\npresent at P = 0 [(1,0) and (1,1)] and two more appear\nat P \u2248 20 kbar.\nIn Fig. 4 it is shown the OS as a function of the pressure, for the first electron-hole states with m = 0. Each\nline is labelled according to the corresponding transition\n(Ne , Nh ; m), which means a transition between the valence band states Nh to the conduction band states Ne .\nOnly those states with Ne = Nh are shown, because they\npresent the stronger values of the OS. The values of the\nOS corresponding to the transitions with Nh 6= Ne are\nvery small and decrease with the pressure. There are\n\nshown by solid lines the transitions from heavy hole valence band and by dashed lines from light hole valence\nband, for comparison. The configuration used was a = 9\nnm and b/a = 0.91 while in the inset the same radius\nit is used, but a more confined region with b/a = 0.51.\nIt can be seen that as the number N increases, the OS\nvalue decreases for a given pressure. Nevertheless, the\nOS for the light hole states have larger value than those\ncorresponding to the heavy hole contributions. From the\nfigure follows that as the ratio b/a decreases (b/a = 0.51\nin the inset) and keeping constant the lens radius, the\nvalue of the OS is reduced. This result is a direct consequence of the spatial confinement. Since the energy\nlevels rise with the confinement (see Fig. 3) the wave\nfunctions are less localized and the overlapping of the\nstates with different effective masses decreases. Finally,\nit can be seen the increasing of the OS as P increases.\nHence, we can conclude that at high pressure the main\ncontribution to the observed PL lines comes from these\nstates with Ne = Nh .\nTaking in consideration the selection rules above obtained, in Fig. 5 is shown, in solid lines, the variation with the pressure of the first allowed optical transition energies for Ne = Nh and two InAs/GaAs quantum lens configuration. In Fig. 5 a) it is considered\nb/a = 0.91 while in Fig. 5 b) we have a stronger deformed lens with b/a = 0.51. In both cases we used\na = 9 nm, \u2206/R = 0.3 and a 500 \u00d7 500 matrix in the\ndiagonalization procedure. The dashed line is the variation of the energy gap of the GaAs surrounding medium\nas a function of the pressure.

Solid lines are obtained considering finite barrier while dotted lines represent\nthe result with infinite barrier using an effective radius aef f\nas a fitting parameter at P = 0.\n\nelectron-light hole state. As can be seen, the values of the\ntransition energy for these states always increases with\npressure. This behavior is due to the InAs energy gap dependence on P according to Eq. (2)35,48 . In the case of\nFig. 5 b), the stronger confinement provokes an increases\nof the corresponding energy levels and at P = 0 we are in\npresence of only two transitions, while transitions (1,2;2)\nand (2,2:0) appear for P > 20 kbar.\nOn the other hand, each panel shows, in dotted line,\nthe calculation using the infinite potential barrier model.\nHere, we introduced an effective radius aef f as a fitting\nparameter at P = 0 for the ground transition energy\n(1, 1; 0). In Fig. 5 a) the fitting procedure is reasonable\ngood for the electron-hole ground state (1,1;0) for all values of P but it becomes worse for the excited ones. In the\ncase of Fig. 5 b), the implementation an aef f at P = 0\ndoes not work properly even for the (1,1;0) transition\nand it does not have sense for the (2,2;0) electron-hole\nstate transition. This result can be understood taking in\n\nconsideration that Fig. 5 b) corresponds to the strong\nconfinement regime and the infinite barrier model break\ndown. It the case of a quantum lens with higher values\nof b/a and radius (soft confinement regime), the energy\nlevels are deep enough in the well. Then, the finite value\nof the band offset, and its dependence with the pressure,\nwill have no appreciable influence on the transitions energies and the model of infinite barrier will be suitable\nfor characterize the system.\n\nIV.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL\nRESULTS.\n\nIn spite of the limitation of the present simulation we\nexplored its viability comparing with available experimental data. Figure 6 shows, in solid circles, the experimental transition energy for the electron-hole ground sate\nas a function of the pressure for an InAs/GaAs SAQD\nreported in Refs. 29 and 30. We have calculated the\nground state transition energy (Ne = 1, Nhh = 1; m = 0)\nin terms of the applied hydrostatic pressure. To fit the\ndata in our calculation we fixed the ratio b/a = 0.34 independent of P and used the value of a = 6.4 nm at P = 0.\nThe theoretical result is shown in solid line. Note that\nthe value of b/a, but not the radius a, here employed\nmatch very well with the estimation given in Ref. 31.\nNotice from the Fig. 6 that the value of the linear pressure coefficient is dE/dP = 8.3 meV/kbar. In connection\nwith this, the variation of the band offset and the change\nof the effective masses with P are the responsible of the\nobtained value. Also, it is important to remark that the\ninput used value of the linear pressure coefficient in Table I for the InAs is linked to the good match between\n\n\f6\nthe simulation and the experimental data. If the typical\nbulk value of 100 meV/kbar for InAs is used the agreement goes down drastically. The consideration of the\nbuilt-in strain of InAs/GaAs in the framework of twodimensional layer model is one of key factor that allows\nthe correct characterization of the fundamental optical\nemission as function of the hydrostatic pressure.\nV.\n\ntwo-dimensional layer approximation guarantying a reliable description of the fundamental PL line as a function\nof the applied pressure.\nThe present model is a qualitative one which needs to\nbe improved in order to include the more complex effects\npresent in such structures such as the real strain field in\ndots with lens symmetry, the peculiarity of the valence\nbands in III-V semiconductors and excitonic effects.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAcknowledgement\n\nIt was developed a model which allows us to include\nthe pressure dependence of the volume, the band offset\nand the effective masses in the calculation of the energy\nlevels at the \u0393 point of the Brillouin zone in SAQDs with\nlens shape geometry. It was outlined the importance of\nthe involved parameters on the electronic states and on\noptical emission for SAQDs under hydrostatic pressure\nranging between 0 and 40 kbar. Also, we have delimited the validity of the infinite potential barrier model\nfor the evaluation of the energy levels as a function of\nthe hydrostatic pressure in quantum lens.\nThe strong strain effect of InAs/GaAs on the gap energy and pressure coefficient can be considered under\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\nI.
