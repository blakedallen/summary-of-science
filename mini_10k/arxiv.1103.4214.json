Massive galaxies at high z become more and more important to\nstudy. In fact, the availability of multi-wavelength data from new generations of deep surveys,\nincluding wide field panoramic surveys, allowed for searches for such massive galaxy candidates up to z \u2243 4 \u2212 6.5 (Giavalisco et al. 2004; Mobasher et al. 2005; McLure et al. 2006;\nYan et al. 2006; Rodighiero et al. 2007; Bouwens et al. 2007; Wiklind et al. 2008; Mancini et al.\n2009; Stark et al. 2009; Mobasher & Wiklind 2010; Dahlen et al. 2010; Capak et al. 2011)\nor even z \u2248 10 (Bouwens et al. 2011). However, still very few is known about the physical\nprocesses underlying the (putative) presence of such massive systems at these high redshifts.\nIn fact, the mere existence of them could seem paradoxical within a direct interpretation of\nthe hierarchical structure formation scenario (e.g. Toomre 1977; White & Rees 1978). Further, such possible contradictions are not necessarily alleviated by the competing monolithic\ncollapse scenario (Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandage 1962; Larson 1974) and hence the question\nabout the existence (and the properties) of massive galaxies at high-redshift remains open.\nRecently, a scenario has emerged to explain massive galaxy formation that shares characterisctics of both the aforementioned classical scenarios, but is nevertheless different. Indeed,\nanalytical models (Salvador-Sol\u00e9 et al. 2005), as well as N-body simulations (Wechsler et al.\n2002; Zhao et al. 2003), have shown that two different phases can be distinguished along halo\nmass assembly: i) first, a violent, fast phase, with high mass aggregation (i.e., merger) rates,\nii) later on, a slow phase, where the mass aggregation rates are much lower. Hydrodynamical\nsimulations have confirmed this scenario and its implications for properties of massive galactic objects at low z, see Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Tenreiro et al. (2006), see also Oser et al. (2010) and\nCook, Lapi & Granato (2009). Concerning high zs, it has been shown that the fast phase\nhas the characteristics of a multiclump collapse, where mergers involve very low relative angular momentum, and, in fact, they are induced by the collapse of flow convergence regions\ndisplaying a web-like morphology (Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Tenreiro et al. 2010).\nIn this Letter we investigate the high mass end of galactic stellar objects at high-redshift\n(z = 4, 5 and 6) obtained by means of self-consistent cosmological simulations within a\nvolume large enough to account for the proper treatment of the large-scale structure yet\nsimultaneously capturing all the relevant small-scale (baryonic) physics. Not only do we\ninvestigate their mere presence, we also study whether they had enough time to dynamically\nrelax at such high redshifts. To this end, we have focused on the intrinsic mass (as opposed\nto luminosity) as well as structural and kinematical properties of these objects at their halo\n(i.e. virial radius) and stellar/galactic scale (to be defined below) as fingerprints of the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nphysical processes involved in their assembly.1 Specifically, we investigate the appearence of\nsamples of high-z massive galactic objects with dynamical planes tilted relative to the virial\nplane, and link their underlying formation physics to the Adhesion Model (Gurbatov et al.\n1989; Vergassola et al. 1994).\nOur results here are an extension to higher zs of previous studies on the fundamental\nplane (FP) at z = 0 (O\u00f1orbe et al. 2005, 2006). In these two papers the different possibilities\ncausing the tilt of the FP relative to the virial plane are analyzed in detail. It is shown that\nthat if both the virial mass to luminosity ratio, Mvir /L, and the mass structure coefficient cvir\nM\n(see Eqs. 2 and 4 in O\u00f1orbe et al. (2005)) are independent of mass, then no FP tilt would be\nmeasured. Here, because mass is considered instead of luminosity and no projection effects\nstar\nare taken into account, we have instead analyzed the mass dependence of the ratio Mbo\n/Mvir\nvir\nstar 2 star\nstar\nstar\nand the mass structure coefficient cM = (GMvir )/([\u03c3bo ] re,bo ), where Mbo and \u03c3bo are the\nstellar mass and the 3D stellar velocity dispersion at the galactic scale, respectively, and\nstar\nre,bo\nis the 3D stellar mass effective radius also defined at the galactic scale2 . We need to\nstress that a mass dependence of either of these quantities automatically implies a tilt of the\ndynamical plane relative to the virial plane.\n\n2.\n\nStructural and kinematical Properties of massive Objects at high-z\n\nThe simulations used here are part of the GALFOBS project. They are N-body + SPH\nsimulations that have been performed using an OpenMP parallel version of the DEVA code\n(Serna, Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Tenreiro, & S\u00e1iz 2003) and the methods for star formation and cooling\ndescribed in Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Serrano et al. (2008). The DEVA code pays particular attention to\nensure that conservation laws (e.g. momentum, energy, angular momentum, and entropy)\nhold as accurately as possible3 . Star formation is implemented through a Kennicutt-Schmidtlike law with a density threshold \u03c1thres and a star formation efficiency of c. The values of\nthese parameters implicitly account for star formation regulation by discrete energy injection\nprocesses.\n1\n\nWe stick to 3D properties as well as mass (instead of luminosity) for two reasons: i) projection effects\nadd noise in the statistical analysis (O\u00f1orbe et al. 2006) and ii) we are not aiming at providing observables\nbut rather at understanding the physical processes involved in the formation of these objects.\n2\n\nPlease refer to Table 1 of O\u00f1orbe et al. (2006) where our nomenclature and definitions are more thoroughly introduced.\n3\n\nThis in particular implies that a double loop in the neighbour searching algorithm must be used, which\nconsiderably increases the CPU time.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe main simulation was carried out in a periodic cube of 80 Mpc side length using 5123\nbaryonic and 5123 dark matter particles with a gravitational softening of \u01ebg = 2.3 kpc and\na minimum hydrodynamical smoothing length half this value. The cosmology applied was a\n\u039bCDM model whose parameters as well as those of the field of primordial density fluctuations\n(i.e., initial spectrum) have been taken from CMB anisotropy data4 (Dunkley et al. 2009),\nwith \u03a9m = 0.295, \u03a9b = 0.0476, \u03a9\u039b = 0.705, h = 0.694, an initial power-law index n = 1,\nand \u03c38 = 0.852. The mass resolution is mbar = 2.42 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 and mdm = 1.26 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and\nthe star formation parameters used were \u03c1thres = 4.79 \u00d7 10\u221225 g \u010bm\u22123 and c = 0.3.\nWhen analyzing galaxy formation in numerical simulations it is desirable to verify that\nthe objects in the simulation are consistent with observations at low z's. Due to the extreme\nCPU consumption by hydrodynamical forces, this is not yet possible for the main GALFOBS\nsimulation. As a way out, we ran three sub-volumes of the main cube using a \"zoom\napproach\". In this approach the gravitational forces have been calculated for the full box\nwhereas the hydrodynamical forces (which are exclusively local) were only computed in a\nsub-box of side length 26 Mpc. These three sub-volumes have been analysed at redshift\nz = 0 showing that we indeed obtain galaxy populations in agreement with low-redshift\nobservations, as we had also previously shown in S\u00e1iz et al. (2004) using the same approach\nyet smaller simulation boxes.\nHalos in our simulations are identified by the OpenMP+MPI halo finder AHF5 (Knollmann & Knebe\n2009) as well as SKID (Weinberg et al. 1997), and their respective results have been crosscompared to check for completeness. The halo scale of these objects is defined by the virial\nradius (rvir ) based upon the Bryan & Norman (1998) fitting function to determine the overdensity threshold. The so-called galactic scale has been based upon material (stars) inside\na sphere of radius r = 0.15 \u00d7 rvir , a scale separating the baryon from the dark matter\ndomination (Bailin et al. 2005). This automated procedure has been tested by comparing\nwith individually determined limiting stellar sizes of several hundred of objects based upon\ntheir 3D visualization as well as their 3D stellar density profiles. We further asked that our\nobjects are not involved in violent events, either at the halo or at the galactic scale. To\nexclude this kind of objects at the halo scale, we have used the form factor, cF , defined via\ntot\ntot\nthe virial relation cF = (GMvir )/([\u03c3htot ]2 re,h\n), where \u03c3htot is the velocity dispersion and re,h\nthe half-mass radius at the halo scale, and we asked it to be within the expected interval\n(1.9, 2.5) for virialized objects (Binney & Tremaine 2008) and of the order of unity if we\n4\n\nhttp://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/params/lcdm sz lens run wmap\n\n5 bao snall lyapost.cfm\n5\n\nAHF can be freely downloaded from http://popia.ft.uam.es/AMIGA\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ntot\nuse rvir instead of re,h\n. The same procedure has been employed on the galactic object scale\nstar\nstar 2 star\nusing \u2013 in analogy \u2013 the parameter cstar\n= (GMbo\n)/([\u03c3bo\n] re,bo ). Again, objects outside\nF\na certain range (based upon a manually gauged subsample of 200 objects for each z) have\nstar\nbeen discarded. Putting a mass threshold of Mbo\n> 1010 M\u2299 , our final samples consists of\n137, 521 and 1315 galaxies at z = 6, z = 5 and z = 4, respectively, not involved in violent\nevents at any scale.\n\nOur first result is in fact the mere existence of these samples of high-redshift relaxed\nmassive galaxies. To understand their origin, we first quantify the correlation and interstar\ntot\nrelation, respectively, between their mass (Mvir and Mbo\n), size (half-mass radii re,h\nand\nstar\n6\ntot\nstar\nre,bo ) and velocity dispersion (\u03c3h and \u03c3bo ) both at the halo and at the stellar scale\ntot\nusing the following variables: Ehalo \u2261 log10 Mvir , rhalo \u2261 log10 re,h\n, vhalo \u2261 log10 \u03c3htot , and\nstar\nstar\nstar\nEstar \u2261 log10 Mbo\n, rstar \u2261 log10 re,bo\n, vstar \u2261 log10 \u03c3bo\n. We list the average values \u1ebc, r\u0303, and\n\u1e7d in Table 1 where we can observe a mild increase of rhalo alongside a decrease of vhalo while\nEhalo remains constant: as the Universe expands, the objects become on average less and\nless compact due to the decrease of the global density (Padmanabhan 1993). We basically\nobserve the same phenomenon on the stellar scale, however, accompanied by a moderate\ntot\nstar\nstar\nincrease in Estar . In fact, the ratios re,h\n/re,bo\nand \u03c3htot /\u03c3bo\nshow an scaling behaviour as a\nstar\nfunction of either Mvir or Mbo (see Table 2 and below).\nGoing one step further, we search for planes in the (E, r, v) space by performing a\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) of all samples. It is made in 3D to circumvent projection\neffects (O\u00f1orbe et al. 2006). We have found that at all redshifts one of the eigenvalues of the\nPCA is considerably smaller than the others, so that (massive) objects populate a flattened\nellipsoid close to two-dimensional, both at the halo scale and at the stellar object scale:\nEs \u2212 \u1ebcs = \u03b1s3D (rs \u2212 r\u0303s ) + \u03b3s3D (vs \u2212 \u1e7ds ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s refers to the scale of the object, i.e. halo or star. Table 1 also lists the values of the\nparameters \u03b1s3D and \u03b3s3D of these planes as well as their bootstrapping errors. We find that\ntot\nat the halo scale the planes are close to the virial plane (VP, defined by (\u03c3htot )2 = GMvir /re,h\n3D\n3D\n= 2), as expected for well-defined haloes. At the stellar scale we also\n= 1, \u03b3halo\nor \u03b1halo\nfind planes to which we refer as the intrinsic dynamical planes (IDPs) and whose observed\nmanifestation is the Fundamental Plane.\nTo better view the IDP's, their relation to the VP and any possible evolution we plot\nthem in Figure 1 for z = 6 (green), z = 5 (red), and z = 4 (blue). Points are the actual\ndata for all the massive objects, shown in a projection where the z = 4 data are edge-on.\n6\n\nWe stress that all our objects here are velocity dispersion supported\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nEllipses stand for the corresponding projections of the 1-sigma 3D ellipsoids (full lines) or\n3-sigma (blue dashed line). The centers of the ellipses are the corresponding projections of\nthe ellipsoid centers. Straight lines have the same directions as the major axes of the ellipses\nresulting from projections of the VPs ellipsoids. Two important results arise from this plot\nand Table 1. First, high-z massive galaxies are on IDP's which are clearly tilted relative to\nthe VP. Second, we observe a mild evolution of the IDP between z = 6 and z = 4, primarily\n3D\ndriven by changes in the average values \u1ebcstar , r\u0303star , \u1e7dstar and not the plane parameters \u03b1star\n3D\nand \u03b3star\n.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion & Conclusions\n\nTo shed more light onto the tilt of the IDP with respect to the VP, and following\nthe discussion in \u00a71, we have first checked if there is a mass homology breaking, that is,\nstar\nif the parameter cvir\nM depends on Mbo . We have calculated its trend with stellar mass\nstar\nM\nM\n(log Mbo\n\u221d \u03b2vir\nlog cvir\nM ) and listed the best fit \u03b2vir in Table 2. Within the error bars the\ncorrelation is consistent with zero. This means that stars accomodate the product of their\nstar star\n\u03c3bo ) according to Mvir . Second, we\nspatial and velocity dispersion distributions (i.e., re,bo\nstar\nstar\nhave checked whether the mass ratio Mbo /Mvir correlates with Mbo\n. And in fact, we find\nthat this ratio decreases for increasing stellar mass at any given z (cf. Table 2). Therefore, we\nexpect the IDP to be tilted against the VP (as discussed in the Introduction and explained\nin O\u00f1orbe et al. 2005, 2006). We further compared our results against a simulation with\ndifferent star formation parameters and found no difference concerning the IDP tilt.\nBut how can we understand these trends with respect to scenarios of galaxy formation?\nIn order to answer this question we need to additionally consider the ratio of hot and cold\nbaryon mass inside rvir (i.e. Mhhb /Mhcb ) as a function of the mass scale. First we note that\nmass assembly of the objects we analyze is dominated by cold accretion mode, in consistency\nwith Kere\u0161 et al. (2009) results with the entropy-conserving GADGET-2 code. Now, the\nstar\n\u221d \u03b2 log Mhhb /Mhcb are given in Table 2\nbest-fit parameters to the scaling relation log Mbo\nagain. There we find that the fraction of hot over cold baryons increases very significantly\nas we go to higher masses. We can further acknowledge from Table 2 that the overall baryon\nstar\nfraction fB \u2261 Mhbar /Mvir does not depend on Mbo\n. Both these results taken together imply\nthat massive haloes have proportionally less cold gas available to be accreted from the halo\nstar\nand transformed into stars than less massive ones. This explains the trend of Mbo\n/Mvir\nwith the mass scale found above. Further, it is worth noting that all the \u03b2 slopes in Table 2\nchange from one z to another only within their errors.\nNow, why is more hot gas relative to cold gas enclosed within the virial radius as Mvir\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nincreases? To answer to this question we have to recall how massive galaxies assemble their\nmass. Very briefly, our simulations show that massive galaxies form from gaseous mass\nelements enclosed by overdense subvolumes within the simulation box. As predicted by the\nAdhesion Model (Gurbatov et al. 1989; Vergassola et al. 1994) we have found that gas is\nbi-phasic. Indeed, at a given time a distinction can be made between singular gaseous mass\nelements (as those that have already been involved in caustic, i.e., singularity, formation\nat this time) and regular ones (those that have not yet been trapped into a caustic and\ntend to be of low density). We have also found that, from a global point of view, mass\nelements are dynamically organized as a hierarchy of flow convergence regions (FCRs), that\nis, attraction basins for mass flows. At high z FCRs undergo fast contractive deformations,\nthat violently shrink them, transforming most of the cold, densest gaseous mass elements\nthey contain into stars and heating the diffuse component there. Due to its low density,\nthis component, once heated tends to keep hot along evolution, and forms shock fronts\nthat expand, in consistency with Birnboim & Dekel (2003) results. We refer the reader to\nDom\u0131\u0301nguez-Tenreiro et al. (2010) for a more elaborate discussion.\nIn the simulations analyzed in this Letter, we have witnessed events occurring along\nthe fast phase of massive galaxy formation, see \u00a71: very fast mass assembly, dissipation\nand star formation rates ensuing FCR contractive deformations. These contractions act\non dynamical timescales that are short because we have high overdensities where massive\ngalaxies are about to form, therefore explaining the presence of massive objects in a young\nUniverse. Additionally, such violent FCR contractions tend to swallow the mass close to\nthem, severely limiting the amount of mass available to be further assembled after they\noccur. This would explain why a fraction of the objects we have identified are not dynamically\ndisturbed. We have also seen in the simulations the gravitational gas heating due to these\nviolent dynamical events, that partially transform the ordered mechanical energy involved\nin contractions into thermal energy and pressure. This is a crucial point for understanding\nthe tilt of the IDP's at high z's. To be quantitative, recall for example that a system must\nget rid of an amount of energy equal to its binding energy as it collapses from infinity and\nvirializes (Binney & Tremaine 2008). This binding energy per unit virial mass increases with\n2/3\nhalo mass as Mvir , so that at assembling a galaxy, the more massive it is the more energy per\nunit mass is available to heat and pressurize the gas at the corresponding FCR contraction.\nOtherwise, as explained above, after these violent events most of the heated low density gas\nelements remain hot. This implies that more hot gas relative to cold gas is enclosed within\nrvir as Mvir increases, as we have found. Therefore, we can conclude that the origin of the\nIDPs tilt relative to VPs lies in that gravitational gas heating processes are more effective\nas the mass of the halo increases and that there is not mass homology breaking. Finally, let\nus stress that the same physical processes act along the fast phase, as the slopes in Table 2\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndo not change with zs.\nSumming up, the processes involved in high-z massive galaxy formation are: FCR contractions (approximatively equivalent to collapse) acting on a bi-phasic gas, induced by\nsingularity formation in terms of the Adhesion Model approximation; the ensuing transformation of the ordered mechanical energy of contraction into velocity dispersion, and then\npartially into thermal energy and gas pressure, on the same timescales; and dense gas elements shrinkage, cooling and their transformation into stars. Energy injection is unlikely to\nsubstantially change the processes responsible for this high z FP tilt, because, as explained,\nthey have to do with caustic (i.e. singularity) formation. We conclude that the violent\nprocesses described above are responsible for having: 1) massive objects at high redhisft, 2)\nhot gas coronae, 3) less cold gas to form stars as the mass scale increases, because we have\nmore gas heated, implying IDP's tilted relative to VP's, among other results. We see that\nthe same processes are responsible for obtaining massive stellar objects shortly after the Big\nBang as well as having them lying on IDPs: fast FCR contractions at different scales are the\nengine driving them.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for useful suggestions that improved the manuscript.\nWe thankfully acknowledge to D.
