Nonlinear\nmetamaterials, however, as Zheludev points out in [7],\nare sill \"green apples\" on the knowledge tree for metamaterials.\nIn the discussions of nonlinear metamaterials, particularly those composed of nonlinear split-ring resonators\n(SRR), it will be of great convenience to treat the metamaterials as continuous materials with controllable optical constants [e.g. \u03bc(I) and n(I)], which allows us\nto employ existing concepts and methods in nonlinear\noptics. Several works since [8], including [9\u201314], focus\non this approach. They either directly assume intensitydependent-index continuous media or assume uniform responses of the discrete system before calculating optical\nconstants. These approaches share a common implicit\nassumption, i.e., on a scale much smaller than the wavelength, a cluster of discrete inclusions in a metamaterial\nshould uniformly (at least slowly-varyingly) respond to\nexternal radiation. This assumption justifies the continuous descriptions which investigate the materials by\npartial differential equations. Particularly, some of them\n([8] and [15]) propose applications for global-geometryindependent optical switching based on the bistable properties of these local controllable optical constants. Note\nthat these bistabilities8,15 are obtained after assuming\nthat all the meta-atoms respond uniformly in the materials, at least in the equal phase planes, just as in the\nlinear cases.\nHowever, we should note, that nonlinear metamaterials (usually composed of nonlinear SRR) are intrinsically\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ndyi@pku.edu.cn\nrpwang@pku.edu.cn\n\ndiscrete, and that they can even present strong local feedback at the \"single-atom\" level, unlike the conventional\nnonlinear optical materials to which the feed-back is usually introduced globally (e.g. by two mirrors in a FabryPerot cavity). Therefore, we expect to gain more knowledge if we treat the nonlinear metamaterials as discrete,\ninteracting nonlinear lattices as they are.\nSome results have been obtained by treating the nonlinear metamaterials as discrete nonlinear lattices, including [16\u201322]. What we should pay particular attentions is the series of works16,17,19,22 , in which the authors\nshow that the steady responses of dissipative SRR arrays\nmay violate the translational symmetry and can be in the\nmultibreather states23 even when the arrays are driven by\nuniform radiation. The breather states in these works are\ntheoretically constructed in the week-interaction regime\nand in the anti-continuous limit24 in which the states are\na priori nonuniform and may in practice be excited by\nintroducing chirping radiation25,26 .\nIn this paper, by investigating nonlinear effective circuit models, we show that even when we start from\nthe nearly-zero states under uniform external radiations,\nmodulational instabilities will step in the bistable ranges\nproposed in [8], i.e., the responses of the SRR array will\nspontaneously break the translational symmetry , and\nfinally arrive at nonuniform states or even be chaotic,\nwhich will make the definition of optical constants in [8]\ninvalid at least in the bistable range of interest. These\nresults reveal that the switching of field-dependent optical constants may not exist due to modulational instabilities. Despite the negative results, we propose the\npossibility of constructing all-optical comparators based\non the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking phenomenon of\ntwo strongly coupled SRR. We also propose to utilize\nthe valuable enhanced nonlinearity in SRR arrays, by introducing global feed-back mechanism as in usual cases.\nFinally, we comment on the relations of the results here\nbased on our discrete models for metamaterials and those\nin the literatures.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE THEORETICAL MODEL\n\nWhen a plane wave is normally incident into a threedimensional nonlinear metamaterial composed of SRR, if\nwe adopt the uniform assumption as in8 , the SRR located\non an equal-phase plane of the wave will experience uniform external driving force (induced by other SRR and\nthe external radiation) and respond with uniform amplitude and phase. We can thus simplify our considerations\nby focusing on a two-dimension (or even one-dimension)\narray of SRR radiated by uniform external fields. If we\nfind that in some cases the uniform assumption is not\nvalid even in the equal phase plane, we can undoubtedly\nconclude that such assumption is not valid in the threedimension bulk materials.\nWe model a rectangle lattice of SRR by LCR circuits\ncoupled by mutual inductance (just as in 8) with nearestneighbor approximations and periodic boundary conditions. In terms of dimensionless quantities, the dynamic\nequation of the lattice under slowly-varying approximation is\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndqi,j\ndqi\u22121,j\ndqi+1,j\n(2i\u03a9 + \u03b3)\n+ 2i\u03a9\u03bax\n+\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndqi,j+1\ndqi,j\u22121\n= ui,j +\n+\n+2i\u03a9\u03bay\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\u03bax \u03a92 (qi\u22121,j + qi+1,j ) + \u03bay \u03a92 (qi,j\u22121 + qi,j+1 )\n\u2212(\u2212\u03a92 + i\u03b3\u03a9 + 1 \u2212 |qi,j |2 )qi,j\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ui,j , qi,j are the (dimensionless) local electromotive force acting on the SRR at site (i, j) and the\nelectric charge hold by its capacitor, respectively. The \u03a9\nis the dimensionless frequency; \u03c4 , the time; \u03b3, the resistance; \u03bax,y , mutual inductances between nearest neighbors in the 'x, y' directions, respectively. Then the steady\nstates should satisfy the equation\n\nemploy the formalism in [21] but focus on the model (1)\nintroduced in the previous section.\nUnder uniform-response assumption as in [8], i.e.,\nui,j = u and qi,j = q, the Eqs.(2) for steady states are\nsimplified\nu + (2\u03bax \u03a92 + 2\u03bay \u03a92 + \u03a92 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03a9 \u2212 1 + |q|2 )q = 0. (3)\nWe can solve this equation and obtain the bistabilities\nof uniform responses as illustrated in Fig.(1). However,\nsince mutual interactions in densely stacked metamaterials are inevitably present, it is a nature question that\nwhether possible excitations of magneto-inductive waves\n(spatial Fourier components of fluctuations) could induce\nmodulational instabilities of these uniform states. By\nlinear stability analysis (e.g.,[21 and 23]), we can obtain\nthe growth rate for each Fourier component of magnetoinductive waves Eq.(B3). If for all Fourier components,\n\u03bb(k) has a negative real part, the corresponding state is\nstable. Otherwise, unstable.\nAfter the linear stability analysis, the stable and instable uniform responses are denoted by solid and dashed\nsegments in Fig.(1), respectively. Since we have chosen\nan equal phase plane to investigate, the mutual inductances between nearest neighbors should be positive in\none direction and negative in the other direction. In all\ncases in Fig.(1), we can clearly identify critical points as\nthe boundaries between the stable and instable ranges.\nAs the system is tuned from the stable ranges (across\nthe critical points) to the instable ranges, we expect that\nit will spontaneously break the translational symmetry\nand actually be in nonuniform states. We can also observe from Fig.(1) and Eq.(B3) that in the low intensity\nlimit, the modulational instability is absent for all cases\nimplying that nonlinear metamaterials always allow uniform description in perturbative regimes.\n\n8\n\nx 10\n\nui,j + \u03bax \u03a92 (qi\u22121,j + qi+1,j ) + \u03bay \u03a92 (qi,j\u22121 + qi,j+1 )\n(2)\n\nMore detailed definitions of the quantities are presented in Appendix A.\nIII. MODULATIONAL INSTABILITIES OF\nUNIFORM RESPONSES OF AN SRR ARRAY\n\nThe modulational instabilities of continuous nonlinear materials with negative refraction index have\nbeen studied in [11], in which temporal, spatial, and\ntemporal-spatial modulational instabilities are all studied. The spatial modulational instabilities of threedimension discrete nonlinear SRR arrays induced by\nmagneto-inductive waves have been studied in [21], in\nwhich it is shown that the unstable range may completely\ncover the decreasing range of the bistability, especially\nthe two switching points.

In order to show an explicit picture of typical\nnonuniform responses when a system has evolved into\nthe unstable range, we directly integrate Eqs.(1) using\nthe Runge-Kutta method. In the recent papers16,17,19 ,\nsingle breather states (localized states which break the\ntranslational symmetry) are constructed from the anticontinuous limit in the weak-coupling regime. But these\nmethods possibly can not be used in our problems since\nthe coupling may be too strong for a single breather's\nexistence. Here, we start from nearly-zero states with\ntiny random fluctuations and turn on the uniform radiation at the beginning. We then monitor the time-domain\nresponses of two-dimension model (containing 10 \u00d7 10\nSRR) under different intensities of radiation. The results\nare shown in Fig.(2). The parameters are chosen as the\ncase with uniform bistable response in Fig.(1). In that\ncase, the critical radiation intensity u is about 0.0016\nwhich is the boundary between the stable range and unstable range. In Fig.(2), we test four radiation intensities\n|u| = 0.0014, 0.0016, 0.0018 and 0.020, of which the former three are near the critical value while the fourth is\ndeep in the unstable range. The initial response is nearly\nzero with each individual response randomly distributing within [0, 10\u22126]. For each test intensity, we evolve\nthe system for 104 periods and plot the time-domain responses of the the SRR at two different sites, (1,1) and\n(5,5). The final states for each case are also plotted in\n3D figures. We observe that for the intensity below the\ncritical value |u| = 0.0014, the response of the system\nquickly converge to a steady state which is uniform for\nall SRR, which means that the uniform assumption in [8]\nis justified. However, when the intensity enters the unstable range, e.g., |u| = 0.0018, the system spontaneously\nevolve into nonuniform states and cannot even reach a\nsteady state (it seems like a limit circle state with periodic oscillation). For the case very near to the boundary\n|u| = 0.0016, the situation is similar to |u| = 0.0018\nwith the translational symmetry also drastically broken.\nWhen we come to the case in the deep unstable range\n|u| = 0.020, it is even worse is that the time-domain\nresponses quickly become chaotic. A common characteristic for the cases with nonuniform responses is that\nthe actual states are highly disordered with individual\nresponses being randomly positive and negative, which\ncan hardly support regular wave propagation.\n\n|\n\n0.08\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n-1\n10\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n5000\n\u03c4\n\n10000\n\nSite: n\n\nFIG. 2. The time-domain dynamics for different radiation\nintensities. For each intensity the final states after \u03c4 = 104\ntime of evolving are plotted in 3D figures.\n\ndetails of the complexity (e.g., [17 and 18]) in these\nranges, we may also focus on few-body systems to avoid\nthese complexities.\nThe spontaneous symmetry breaking (bifurcation) and\nits sensitivity on small deviations indicate that this phenomenon can be utilized to construct comparators. In\nFig.3, we illustrate this possible application by plotting\nthe evolution of the steady states (obtained from Eq.(2))\nof two coupled SRR under the continuous tuning of the\noverall intensities of the two electromotive forces which\ndeviate from each other by a small amount (10\u22123 ). Although in the initial state the responses of the two SRR\nonly have a tiny difference, the resulting states in the\nsymmetry-breaking range can have a large contrast ratio. This property can be used to compare which signal\n(in our case the electromotive force) has a larger initial\namplitude. Due to the small size of SRR compared to the\n\n\f4\nworking wavelength, the two SRR should be excited and\ndetected via near-field ways (e.g. [27]). Such a device,\nif the two SRR can be fabricated as identical as possible, can be used to realize ultra-sensitive and possibly\nutlra-compact all-optical comparators in applied areas.\nWe should stress that such applications do not have to\nrely on SRR, and they may be even realized in any other\ndevices if two identical nonlinear resonators are strongly\ncoupled with each other, resulting possible spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking (e.g., [28\u201330]). These devices do not\ninvolve any assistance from electronic devices and thus\nmay be of interest in the fields such as all-optical logic\ngates, all-optical signal processing and photonic computers (e.g., [31\u201333]). One remarkable feature of our proposal is that we do not need high quality factor as other\napplications for optical signal processing31,34\u201337 , since we\nonly assume Qf = 10 in our calculations. We also do not\nneed uniform bistability.\n\n0.6\n\n0\n|q |-|q |\n\n(b) 0.1\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n|q |\n\n(a) 0.7\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.4 0.5\n|q |\n1\n\n0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n0.5\n\n1\n|u|\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 3. a): The principle of the proposed comparator made of\ntwo strongly coupled identical SRR.

If SRR are simply stacked\ntogether, however, problems will arise as we have studied. One way out to utilize the enhanced nonlinearity\nis to focus on few-body devices as we studied in the\nprevious section, i.e, directly making use of the multistabilities and modulational instabilities. Another is to\noperate the stacked devices under the low-intensity radiation and introduce global feed-back mechanism, e.g.,\nsetting them (e.g., the structure in [15]) in Fabry-Perot\ncavities with optical lengths much larger than the wavelength. This approach can not only effectively employ\nthe enhanced nonlinearity originating from the sing-atom\n\nlevel, but also avoid the modulational instabilities suffered by the devices at higher intensities. That is because the FP-bistability requires a jump of the refraction\nindex only of order \u03bb/LF P (compared to the negativepositive jump proposed in [8 and 15]), where \u03bb is the\nwavelength and LF P is the length of the cavity. Detailed\nestimations reveal that due to the field enhancement in\nthe narrow gap, the required radiation intensity inside\nthe FP cavity would be smaller by a factor of about\n10\u22125 than that required if the FP is filled with the same\nkind of pure Kerr materials (see Appendix C). This SRRenhanced nonlinearity may be even more powerful and\nuseful when combined with other nonlinearity-enhancing\nmechanisms, e.g., [38 and 39].\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nWe want to comment on the relations between nonlinear metamaterials composed of SRR and natural nonlinear materials composed of natural atoms. The usually mentioned bistabilities in natural materials are induced by a global feed-back mechanism and work at a\nperturbative regime, i.e., the nonlinearity is restricted\nto the third-order. In other words, usual optical bistabilities are actually the nonlinear properties of certain\nglobal optical modes. No direct applications related to\nbistabilities in natural materials have been focusing on\nthe non-perturbative regime in which the nonlinearity is\nvery large at single-atom level or equivalently the radiation field intensity is comparable to the intrinsical field\nintensities in the atom level, since the responses may be\nvery complex and very hard to control. Similarly, the\nproposals on controlling the bistabilities of the uniform\noptical constants8,15 are just examples of working in the\nnon-perturbative regime of the effective index of the bulk\nmetamaterials, so it is not at all surprising to see the\nunpleasant instability problems. Actually, the uniform\nbistabilities in [8 and 15] are properties of local resonance responses rather global modes in usual case. Our\nproposal to introduce global feed-back by setting an SRR\narray in an FP cavity is just an attempt to avoid these\nnon-perturbative regimes and try to seek a perturbative\nregime (using optical modes) to utilize the SRR-enhanced\nnonlinearity. We illustrate the difference between bistabilities of local responses and global modes in Fig.1.\nWe also want to stress on the relations between the\nspatial modulational instabilities discussed in this paper and those for continuous nonlinear media. Continuous descriptions assume homogenization of a material\nand employ partial differential equations. The modulational instabilities and related solitons in continuous\ndescriptions (e.g., [11]), if indeed valid, are actually triggered by certain exploding long-wavelength (compared\nwith the lattice constant) magneto-inductive waves40\n(or equivalents in other discrete systems) and at the\nsame time preserved by the decaying short-wavelength\nmagneto-inductive waves in the discrete descriptions.\nHowever, our results in Fig.1 and Fig.2 show no indica-\n\n\f5\ntion of such long-wavelength-only modulational instabilities even in the low intensity range. All the modulationalinstability-induced nonuniform states in Fig.2 have shortwavelength components. This seems like a paradox. Remember that the self-focusing-induced spatial modulational instabilities originate from the propagations of\nwaves. As we state in the theoretical model section, we\nhave only analyzed the modulational instabilities of an\nequiphase surface and have not involved the stabilities\nof propagations of waves, and therefore our results do\nnot imply the paradox. These arguments implies that at\ncomparatively low intensities, the spatial modulational\ninstabilities can still happen due to propagation effects.\nAs an added note, the modulational instability discussed\nin this paper should be termed as subwavelength modulational instability as in a recent publication [41].\nWe should also note that in the perturbative range\n(or low intensity range) in Fig.1, the stable uniform responses enable the materials to be perturbatively characterized as nonlinear media with Kerr nonlinearity (also\nindicated in the Appendix C). Therefore, the works (mentioned in the Introduction section) which directly assume\nKerr nonlinearities together with negative refraction indexes could be regarded as theories describing the perturbative properties of real discrete nonlinear metamaterials\n(e.g., as in42 ).\nOne may question our negative results by referring to\nthe experimental works43,44 . Although frequency shift\nis demonstrated (certainly not sufficient for the index\nswitching), no strong evidences (e.g., hysteresis curve) for\nbistability-related index switching are discovered, however. Moreover, the nonlinear metamaterials in [43 and\n44] are excited by monopole antennas, a nonuniform experiment condition way too far from explicitly demonstrating the uniform bistability of optical constants. In\nfact, the two papers only claim that their metamaterials are tunable and do not claim that the bistability is\nconfirmed. Another question would arise from the LCR\nmodel we employ. Although this model is more or less\nsimplified and is not general, it can capture the main\nfeatures of many metamaterials, e.g., resonances, loss,\nmutual interactions, Kerr nonlinearity. Therefore, our\nresults can give strong caveat for considering the applications of the nonperturbative behaviors of effective optical constants (e.g., bistability of refraction index) when\ninteraction-induced modulational instability in the lattice level is possibly present, since the effective optical\nconstants in those cases may be ill defined. We also\nwant to point out that the recent publication41 mentioned above investigate another kind of nonlinear arrays.\nAfter making dipolar and slowly-varying approximation\nnear a resonance, they derive almost the same formulism\nas in this paper and also obtain modulational instability\nin the uniform bistable range.\nWe also feel it is necessary to clarify the difference between the bistability of optical constants in the\nproposals8,15 and the bistability induced by periodic\nstructures45,46 in the literatures. The origin of the former is the local feed-back at the single-atom level while\n\nthat of the latter is just the periodicity, (termed as distributed feed-back in the seminal paper47 ). The periodicity of the former has been homogenized, being replaced\nby a homogenized optical constant. What is more, the\nformer is derived by local consistent equations of local\noptical constants and do not rely on the shape of the\nbulk material (explicitly shown in [8]; in [15] different\nshapes are used with the same interpretation), while the\nlatter is derived from the global consistent equations explicitly determined by the boundary or periodicity. One\ncan also introduce such distributed or global feedbacks\non a length scale larger than the wavelength to achieve\nbistability in metamaterials as we propose in the previous section. These differences all arise from the working\nwavelengths of these phenomena, one is larger than the\nlattice constant while the other is comparable or smaller\nthan that. Therefore, the historical success45,46 cannot\nbe evidences for the theoretical proposals in8,15 .\nFinally, we should be reminded that if the whole array\nof SRR are rather sparsely arranged, i.e., the coupling between neighbors can be neglected (gas phase), the localbistability-based optical switching should also approximately be valid although the two switching points are\ninevitably affected according to Eq.(B3). But in those\ncase the array is so sparse that it can hardly be treated\nas effective materials. The coupling parameters chosen\nin this paper is more typical in realistic cases (condensed\nphase).\n\nVIII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBy investigating the modulational instabilities and\nmultistabilities, we find that some recently proposed optical switching based on the bistability arising from uniform assumptions may not be valid. In order to get\nrid of this dilemma, we propose two approaches to utilize the valuable enhanced nonlinearity of metamaterials\nat single-atom level, one is to focus on the multistabilities of few-body problems (e.g., all-optical comparator)\nand the other is to operate them at low radiation intensities by introducing global feed-back mechanism to\nachieve global bistability effects (e.g., Fabry-Perot cavity) in perturbative regimes of optical constants. Finally,\nwe briefly discuss the relations between our results and\nexisting ones in the literatures. Particularly, we distinguish the questioned bistability supported by local resonance and the usual bistability of global optical modes\n(global resonances, or global feed-backs) and stress that\nthe former may easily be destroyed by modulational instability induced by discreteness and mutual interaction\nin dense materials.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe especially thank Cuicui Lu and Junhui Li for their\ncareful reviews of this paper and constructive suggestions.

The Qi,j is the\ncharge hold by the capacitor at the site (i, j). The Mx,y\nare mutual inductances between nearest neighbors in the\nx (y) directions, respectively. Note that the nearestneighbor approximation is employed.\nIn our case where the split of the ring is filled by Kerr\nmaterials, the effective capacitance depends on the electric field intensity, Eg , in the gap, i.e., C = C0 (1 +\n|Eg |2 /|Ec |2 ). Here, the C0 is the zero-field capacitance\nand the |Ec | is the characteristic field intensity.\nWe also have the relation between Q and Eg in the\nquasi-steady states,\nQ = CEg dg .\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere dg is the gap width of the capacitor.

First of all, for the bistability to\noccur the required radiation intensity should reach a certain scale to induce nonlinear deviation of the refraction\nindex \u2206n \u223c \u03bb/LF P , where \u03bb is the radiation wavelength\nin the metamaterial and LF P is the length of the FP cavity. This is usually a small factor provided that LF P \u226b \u03bb,\n\n\f7\nwhich will effectively reduced the required radiation intensity and thus help to avoid the modulational instabilities at higher radiation intensities. In this regime, the\nnonlinearity of the metamaterial can be treated perturbatively.\nThus we need that the radiation propagate at least\nLF P distance before it significantly attenuate. To this\nend, we should work at the frequencies where the metamaterial is transparent, i.e., far from the absorption\n(|\u03b4| = 10/Qf , where the detuning \u03b4 = (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )/\u03c90 ),\nand therefore the lossless approximation R = 0 can be\njustified. According to the results in the Theoretical\nModel section, the effective magnetization coefficient of\nthe metamaterials can be approximately written in this\ncase as \u03c7(|e|) = \u03c7l [1 \u2212 |e|2 /(2\u03b4)]. To express \u03c7 in term\nof the radiation intensity |E|2 , we should relate the dimensionless field intensity |e| in the gap to the radiation\nintensity |E|.\nThe total electromotive force accumulated along the\nring is\nZ\n2\u03c0 2 r2\n|U | = | (ik \u00d7 E) * dS| \u223c\n|E|,\n(C1)\n\u03bb\nwith r being the radius of the SRR.
