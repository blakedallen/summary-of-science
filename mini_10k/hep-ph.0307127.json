In particular, it states that a particle and its anti-particle must\nhave the same mass and lifetime. It is based on three\nreasonable assumptions:\n\u2022 Lorentz invariance,\n\u2022 Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian,\n\u2022 Locality.\nIf CPT is found violated, the implication to the fundamental physics is enormous, as at least one of the three\nassumptions above must be violated. One way to prove\nthe CPT theorem is by defining S-matrix elements by\nanalytic continuation of the Euclidean correlation functions. The CPT transformation is then achieved by the\nEuclidean rotation that changes the sign of the (imaginary) time and all spatial coordinates, and hence is a\nsymmetry of the S-matrix elements. String theory is\nnormally argued to be CPT-conserving, as its S-matrix\nelements are defined precisely in this fashion. However,\nit does not exclude the possibility of a spontaneous violation of the CPT symmetry depending on the details of\nthe low-energy limit. Kostelecky and collaborators have\na series of papers on possible CPT violation based on\nthis point of view [2]. It was also argued that it may\nbe possible to break CPT in a field theory by giving up\nlocality but not the other two [3] (see, however, Ref. [4]\nfor criticisms).\nRecently, a possible CPT violation which allows different masses for particles and anti-particles has attracted attention in neutrino oscillation phenomenology.\nIf three indications for the neutrino oscillation, solar\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], atmospheric [11], and LSND [12], are\nall correct, we have to accommodate three mass-squared\ndifferences of quite different orders of magnitudes, which\nis not possible within the three generations of neutrinos.\nA fourth kind of neutrino is usually invoked to explain\nthe data. It has to be \"sterile\" so that it does not violate the data from Z 0 decay at Large Electron Positron\ncollider (LEP): N\u03bd = 2.994 \u00b1 0.012 [13]. However, recent data from SNO requires \u03bde oscillation into an active\n(non-sterile) neutrino [9], while the SuperKamiokande\n\nprefers \u03bd\u03bc oscillation into \u03bd\u03c4 [14], leaving little room for a\nsterile neutrino. Further combined with older data from\nCDHSW [15], Bugey [16], even the extension with a sterile neutrino does not help explain the data very much\n[17]. Yanagida and the author [18] have pointed out\nthat we can explain all data consistently allowing different mass spectra for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, because the solar neutrino oscillation is purely in neutrinos\nwhile statistically significant evidence for oscillation at\nLSND is in anti-neutrinos. This observation was partially motivated by the consistency between the LSND\nand SN1987A data. This possibility of CPT-violating\nneutrino mass spectra was elaborated further by a series\nof works by Barenboim et al [19]. (Indirect constraints\nare important only for the Majorana case [20].)\nPhenomenologically, a stringent limit exists on the\nCPT violation in the neutral kaon system. Thanks to\n0\nthe mixing between K 0 and K , the limit on the possible mass difference between them is exceptionally strong\n[13]:\n0\n\n|m(K 0 ) \u2212 m(K )| < 10\u221218 mK = 0.50 \u00d7 10\u22129 eV. (1)\nGiven such a stringent limit, there does not appear much\nwindow for CPT violation or improved tests [21].\nWe point out that the strength of the CPT limit from\nthe neutral kaon system may be misleading. In lack of\na concrete theory of CPT violation, the limit Eq. (1)\nmay be looked at as a limit on the difference in mass\nsquared rather than the masses. In fact, a local Lagrangian field theory always has mass squared as a natural parameter for bosons. Also in relativistic kinematics,\nmass squared is the natural parameter in Einstein's relation E 2 = ~p2 c2 + m2 c4 rather than the mass itself. If\nreinterpreted as a limit on the possible difference in mass\nsquared, it reads\n0\n\n|m2 (K 0 ) \u2212 m2 (K )| < 0.25 eV2 .\n\n(2)\n\nIt is intriguing that the possible violation of CPT in quantum gravity suppressed by the Planck scale may lead to\nan order of magnitude hvi2 /MP l \u223c 10\u22125 eV, which is well\nwithin the above bound.\nOn the other hand, the neutrino oscillation experiments always measure \u2206m2 , and cannot measure the\n\n\f2\nmasses themselves. Yet, limits on the difference \u03b4 \u2261\n\u2206m2\u03bd \u2212 \u2206m2\u03bd\u0304 can be obtained. The SuperKamiokande\ncollaboration has studied the possible difference in neutrino and anti-neutrino \u2206m2 in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Their current limit is [23]\n\u2212 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 < \u03b4 < 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .\n\n(3)\n\nThis limit is much better than that from the kaon system. We have to note, however, that this limit assumes\nthe same maximal mixing for both neutrinos and antineutrinos. The limit may be considerably worse if this\nassumption is relaxed [22].\nWe find that the best limit comes from the comparison of the solar neutrino data and the recent KamLAND\nresult [24]. We analyze the data within the two-flavor\noscillation framework. However, we emphasize that we\ncannot naively use the result of the global fit to compare\nthe preferred values of \u2206m2 between solar and reactor\ndata. It is because global fits are based on the \u2206\u03c72 relative to the minimum and hence defines only the relative\nprobability, while throwing away information on which\nregion of the parameter space is excluded on the basis of\nthe absolute probability. We have to find a way to obtain\nan absolute limit on the parameter.\nKamLAND has recently reported its initial result of a\nsignificant deficit in the reactor anti-neutrino flux [24]. It\ndemonstrated a deficit in the reactor anti-neutrino flux,\nwhich we interpret as neutrino oscillation. Then we can\nspeak of \u2206m\u03bd\u03042 . Combined with the previous reactor experiments CHOOZ [25] and Palo Verde [26], we have a\nrange of \u2206m\u03bd\u03042 not excluded by the data:\n1.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 < \u2206m2\u03bd\u0304 < 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\n\n(4)\n\nat 90% CL independent of the mixing angle [27]. We\nemphasize that both ends of the inequality are the exclusion limits, rather than the \"preferred range\" from the\n\u2206\u03c72 analysis. Therefore, this statement has an absolute\nmeaning: the probability that a value of \u2206m2\u03bd\u0304 outside\nthis range would fluctuate and produce the observed data\nis less than 10%.\nAs for the solar neutrino data, currently the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution is the most preferred, while the\nLOW solution or Vacuum oscillation (VAC) solution may\nexist at a higher confidence level. From the analysis in\n[28], the goodness-of-fit is not necessarily bad even for\nthese solutions or Small Mixing Angle (SMA) solution.\nIt is not clear we can set a lower limit on \u2206m2\u03bd . Fortunately for our purpose, it will suffice to have only an\nupper bound on the \u2206m2\u03bd .\nSNO [9] convincingly established that the survival\nprobability of 8 B neutrinos is about a third.\nBy\nnaively combining the reported numbers on solar neutrino fluxes with the charged-current reaction \u03c6CC =\n+0.09\n1.76+0.06\n\u22120.05 \u22120.09 and with the neutral-current reaction\n+0.46\n\u03c6N C = 5.09+0.44\n\u22120.43 \u22120.43 , we find Psurv = \u03c6CC /\u03c6N C =\n0.346 \u00b1 0.048. The upper bound at 90% CL is Psurv <\n0.425. It is important that it is less than a half. If\n\nthe neutrinos oscillate purely in the vacuum, the deficit\nwould be at most a half in the case of the maximal mixing [29]. The deficit of two thirds is explained only by\nthe presence of the matter effect. In order for the matter effect to be important relative to the mass difference,\n\u2206m2\u03bd is bounded from above. We would like to obtain\na quantitative upper limit on \u2206m2\u03bd using this piece of\ninformation.\nThe Hamiltonian of the two-flavor neutrinos is\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\u221a\n\u0012\n\u2206m2\u03bd \u2212 cos 2\u03b8 sin 2\u03b8\n2GF ne 0\nH=\n. (5)\n+\nsin 2\u03b8 cos 2\u03b8\n0\n0\n4p\nIn this expression we dropped terms that are proportional to the identity matrix as they are not important\nfor the consideration of the survival probabilities. This\nHamiltonian is time-dependent as the electron number\ndensity ne changes in the course of neutrino propagation.

Naively, the consistency\nbetween solar neutrino data and KamLAND seems to\nexclude the possibility of explaining LSND together with\nother data using CPT violation within three generations.\nHowever, the authors of Ref. [22] argued that the antineutrinos are subdominant in atmospheric neutrino data\nand hence \u2206m2 as large as that of LSND is allowed for\nanti-neutrinos. This point had been criticized in [32]. If\nLSND data stands, we may either need more than one\nsterile neutrino [33] or lepton number violating muon decay [34]. In the latter case, Mini-BooNE data will not\nneither confirm or verify LSND data and the situation\nmay remain ambiguous.\nIn summary, we argued that the limit on CPT violation from the neutral kaon system is not as strong\nas it appears once viewed as a constraint on the masssquared difference between kaon and anti-kaon. Compared to the kaon constraint, neutrino oscillation data\nprovide much stronger limits. We derived a limit on\n\u03b4 = \u2206m2\u03bd \u2212 \u2206m\u03bd\u03042 quantitatively from SNO and KamLAND data, with an emphasis on using the absolute\nprobability rather than relying on the \u2206\u03c72 analysis. The\nobtained bound |\u03b4| \u2261 |\u2206m2\u03bd \u2212 \u2206m\u03bd\u03042 | < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\n(90% CL) is currently the best limit on the possible CPT\nviolation in mass-squared of particles and anti-particles.\n\n[*] This work was supported in part by the Director, Office of\nScience, Office of High Energy and Nuclear Physics, Division of High Energy Physics of the U.S. Department of\nEnergy under Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 and in part\nby the National Science Foundation under grant PHY-9514797.\n[1] See, e.g., R.F.
