INTRODUCTION\n\nAbsorption-line systems in the spectra of high-redshift\nsources such as QSOs and GRB afterglows provide opportunities to examine the interstellar gas in galaxies at\nearly cosmic times with samples that are less biased than\nemission-selected samples. These techniques have been\nused to probe the properties of gas clouds at high redshift, where conditions can differ significantly from those\nin the local Universe. Detections of cold molecular gas at\nhigh redshift are less common than might be expected;\nonly about one quarter of DLAs show detectable molecular hydrogen (Noterdaeme et al. 2008a). Even in GRBDLAs, where the sightline pierces deep inside the ISM\nof the host galaxy, molecular gas does not appear often\n(Tumlinson et al. 2007), though it has been detected in\none system via H2 and CO absorption (Prochaska et al.\n2009). The opportunity to detect deuterated hydrogen\nmolecules (HD) exists in many of these systems where\nH2 is seen, and would in principle provide another useful constraint on physical conditions. HD is fragile, easily photo-dissociated, and is present in the Milky Way\ninterstellar medium (ISM) only along reddened sight1 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive,\nBaltimore, MD, 21218, USA\n2 Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne\nUniversity of Technology, Melbourne, Victoria 3122, Australia\n3 Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, Madingley\nRoad, Cambridge CB3 0HA, UK\n4 Laser Center, VU University, De Boelaan 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n5 Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Victoria,\nVictoria, BC V8P 1A1, Canada\n6 University of California Observatories-Lick Observatory, UC\nSanta Cruz, CA 95064, USA\n7 Department of Physics and Center for Astrophysics and\nSpace Sciences, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman\nDr., La Jolla, CA 92093-0424, USA\n\nlines where the absorbing cloud is dense, dusty, and selfshielded. HD may also be an important gas coolant at\nlow density in low-metallicity galaxies, and so it is important to understand the conditions in which it becomes\nabundant. In this Letter we report two new detections\nof HD in high-redshift QSO absorption line systems: the\nsub-DLA at z = 2.09534 toward J2123-0500 and the\nDLA at z = 2.626 toward FJ0812+32. These systems\nshow H2 and HD absorption but are otherwise quite different and revealing.\n2. DATA ON J2123-0500\n\nData on J2123\u20130500 were obtained with Keck/HIRES\nin a series of exposures spanning the nights of 17-20 Aug\n2006. A complete analysis of the spectrum is presented\nby Milutinovic et al. (submitted). The effective spectral\nresolution is R \u223c 100, 000 in the reduced spectrum, with\nS/N \u223c 15 \u2212 20 pix\u22121 across the band where we search\nfor molecular absorption. The sub-DLA at z = 2.0594\nexhibits log N (H I) = 19.18 \u00b1 0.15. These data have\nalso been used to constrain the temporal evolution of\nthe proton-to-electron mass ratio by Malec et al. (2010,\nhereafter M10).\nWe identified the HD lines shown in Figure 1 using the\nlaboratory wavelengths of Ivanov et al. (2008) and the\ntransition strengths of Abgrall & Roueff (2006). Equivalent widths W\u03bb (Table 1) were measured by integration\nover the line profile with respect to an iteratively fitted polynomial continuum. The detected lines were then\nfitted to a single-component curve of growth (COG) parameterized by HD column density N (HD) and the effective doppler width bHD ; the best fit was determined\nto be log N (HD) = 13.84 and b = 1.2 km s\u22121 . Because\nthe detected HD lines lie on the linear and knee portions of the COG, bHD is poorly constrained at the high\nend; conversely, the column density is well constrained\n\n\f2\n1.0\n\nTABLE 1\nSummary of two HD systems\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nLine\nL0-0R(0)\nL1-0R(0)\nL2-0R(0)\nL3-0R(0)\nL4-0R(0)\nL5-0R(0)\nL6-0R(0)\nL7-0R(0)\nL8-0R(0)\nW0-0R(0)\n\n\u03bb0\n\n[\u00c5]1\n\n1105.84\n1092.00\n1078.83\n1066.28\n1054.29\n1042.85\n1031.91\n1021.46\n1011.46\n1007.29\n\nf2\n\n[m\u00c5]3\n\n[m\u00c5]3\n\nW\u03bb\nJ2123-0050\n\nW\u03bb\nFJ0812+32B\n\n0.000743\n0.00297\n0.00675\n0.0115\n0.0164\n0.0206\n0.0236\n0.0254\n0.0262\n0.0325\n\n***\n***\n4.4 \u00b1 2.8\n5.6 \u00b1 0.6\n***\n8.0 \u00b1 0.6\n***\n8.0 \u00b1 1.2\n8.4 \u00b1 1.3\n9.7 \u00b1 2.6\n\n7.8 \u00b1 2.0\n***\n***\n13.1 \u00b1 2.2\n13.4 \u00b1 1.0\n12.7 \u00b1 2.2\n***\n***\n13.8 \u00b1 2.5\n18.4 \u00b1 2.9\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1076\n\n1077\n\n1078\nRest Wavelength [A]\n\n1079\n\n1080\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nL2-0 R(0)\n\nL3-0 R(0)\n\nL5-0 R(0)\n\nL7-0 R(0)\n\n1.0\n\nlog N (HI)\nlog N (H2 )\nlog N (HD)\nbHD [km s\u22121 ]\n1\n2\n3\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n19.18\u00b10.15\n17.64\u00b10.15\n13.84\u00b10.20\n1.9+1.3\n\u22120.5\n\nNormalized Flux\n\nSummary\n21.35\u00b10.10\n19.88\u00b10.10\n15.38\u00b10.20\n0.85\u00b10.20\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nIvanov et al.

As part of their global line-profile\nfitting, M10 obtained log N (HD) = 13.77 and b = 1.9\nkm s\u22121 , a consistent result (Figure 1).\nBy contrast with the HD, there is considerable uncertainty in the H2 column density. M10 assigned two velocity components to the HD-bearing absorber (1 and 2\nin their Table 3); one of which is narrow and saturated\nin H2 . Their evidence for two components was based\non careful treatments of the profile fits; ultimately two\noverlapping components are preferred by the data once\ncontinuum and zeropoint adjustments were taken into\naccount (see their Section 3 and Figure 5). The column\ndensities that minimize \u03c72 for this component are N(0)\n= 15.80, N(1) = 17.52, for a total log N (H2 ) = 17.55 and\nbH2 = 1.9 km s\u22121 . These values yield an unphysical rotational temperature T01 = 171K/ ln(9N (0)/N (1)) = \u221296\nK. Since these lines are highly saturated, much larger\nN(0) is possible with minimal change to the quality of\nthe fit. Milutinovic et al. (2010) used only a single component for these profiles in their analysis of the metal\nlines in this system.\nTo explore how much higher N(0) could be in this saturated component, we searched a column-density space\nparameterized by N(0) and N(1). These results appear in\nFigure 2, where we plot contours of \u03c72 for the global fit.\nFor this test all other parameters in the global fit were allowed to settle at their optimal values. The point marked\n\"1\" is the fiducial fit adopted by M10, with N(0) = 15.56\nand N(1) = 17.55. We find that the \u03c72 contours extend\nup to N(0) \u2243 17 at 99% confidence, well into the range\nwhere T01 reaches reasonable physical values of 100 - 200\nK. We therefore adopt a fiducial model that has N(1) =\n17.55 from the M10 profile fit, and N(0) = 16.86 \u00b1 0.24,\nas shown with the range bar in Figure 2. This latter\nvalue splits the difference between the 99% confidence\ninterval on N(0) and the line of unphysical T01 , and assigns an error that ranges to these extremes (point \"2\").\nThis point is within the 99% confidence interval for the\nprofile fit and also gives a physically sensible T01 = 281\nK (with a lower bound of 147 K).

This\nmodel is consistent with the available line strengths and\nwidths for both H2 and HD and becomes our fiducial\nmodel. The total log N (H2 ) = 17.64 \u00b1 0.15 and we find\nlog N (HD) / 2N(H2 ) = \u22124.1 \u00b1 0.2.\nWe attempted a model of this absorber with a single\nvelocity component in the H2 using a COG; for this case\nN(0) = 15.70, N(1) = 16.20, and log N (H2 ) = 16.41.\nThis fit has the advantage of not requiring any assumption about the J = 0 column density, but has the disadvantage of being an inferior fit to the data, which\nstrongly prefer a two-component fit (M10). This COG\nhas doppler bH2 = 4.6 km s\u22121 , which does not agree as\nwell with the bHD = 1.9 km s\u22121 as the profile fit above.\nMost significantly, this much lower N(H2 ) yields a highly\nanomalous ratio of HD / 2H2 \u223c 10\u22123 . We report this\n\"low H2 \" model here and include this value in later analysis for completeness.\n\n\f3\n1.0\n\n17.8\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n17.6\nlog N(1)\n\n1\n\n0.0\n\n2\n\n1076\n\n1078\n\n1080\n\n1082\n\nRest Wavelength [A]\n1.0\n0.8\n\n17.4\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nK\n\nK\n\n0.0\n\n100\n\nK\n\n200\n\nL0-0 R(0)\n\nL3-0 R(0)\n\nL4-0 R(0)\n\nL4-0 P(1)\n\n1.0\n\n15.5\n\n16.0\n16.5\nlog N(0)\n\n17.0\n\n17.5\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n17.2\n15.0\n\n450\n\n0.2\n\nFig. 2.- Contours of \u03c72 for the saturated component of H2\ntoward J2123-0500.

DATA ON FJ0812+32B\n\nThe data on FJ0812+32 were obtained with\nKeck/HIRES in a series of exposures totaling 14,000 s\nover 16-17 Mar 2005. Another exposure was obtained\non 12 Jan 2008 with the same setup but bluer wavelength coverage. The data were reduced using standard\nXIDL reduction packages. The effective spectral resolution is R \u223c 50, 000 in the reduced spectrum, with\nS/N \u223c 40 pix\u22121 across the band where we search for\nH2 and HD, declining to \u223c 20 pix\u22121 in the blue. These\nhigh-quality data have previously revealed a metal-strong\nDLA (Prochaska, Howk, & Wolfe 2003) with an extremely cold gas cloud Jorgenson et al. (2009, hereafter\nJ09).\nThis system shows six detected HD R(0) lines; the\nother lines missing from Table 1 are blended with other\nfeatures. These lines fall onto the flat portion of a single-\n\n0.2\n0.0\n-100\n\nL8-0 R(0)\n-50\n\nW0-0 R(0)\n0\nVelocity [km s-1]\n\n50\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\nVelocity [km s-1]\n\n50\n\n100\n\n16.0\nlog N(HD)\n\nWe do not detect J = 1 HD in this system, but\nwe can set a limit. The 5-0R(1) line at 1043.295 \u00c5\nfalls into a region of clean continuum with good S/N.\nWe obtain W\u03bb \u2264 2 m\u00c5 (3\u03c3), which translates to N(1)\n\u2264 1.5 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 . From this and the measured N(0),\nwe infer T01 \u2264 46 K for this absorber. This temperature\nis lower than the (problematic) T01 = 292 K for the H2 .\nIn interstellar H2 , T01 is regarded as a reliable measure\nof the gas temperature only above a density nH \u223c 100\ncm\u22123 at which collisions effectively populate J = 1 from\nJ = 0 via proton interchange reactions (Dalgarno, Black,\n& Weisheit 1973). Since HD has a dipole moment, radiative transitions between J = 1 and J = 0 are permitted\n(as they are not for symmetric H2 ) and HD can take on a\nlower excitation temperature than H2 even at high density. Thus this measurement is probably not a reliable\nindicator of temperature in the HD absorbing cloud.\nOf the Lyman series, only Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 are covered by\nour data at \u2265 989 \u00c5 in the rest frame for z = 2.09534.\nThe Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 profiles are damped, and the expected\nD I profile at \u221282 km s\u22121 cannot be measured.\n\n15.5\n15.0\n14.5\n14.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\nbHD [km s-1]\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nFig. 3.- H2 and HD lines in the DLA at z = 2.626 toward\nFJ0812+32. The top panel shows H2 lines from the Lyman 2-0\nband with the best profile fit overlaid. The middle panels show five\nR(0) transitions and one P(1) transition in the HD Lyman-Werner\nbands. The lower panel shows the HD parameter space and the\nbest fit from the COG (filled star). The profile-fitted values are\nmarked with the cross.\n\ncomponent COG (Figure 3), where their column density\nis only moderately constrained. However, the effective\ndopper bHD parameter is well-constrained; the best fit\nis log N (HD) = 15.38 \u00b1 0.25 and bHD = 0.85 \u00b1 0.20\nkm s\u22121 from the COG. A profile fit using VPFIT8 obtained log N (HD) = 15.50 and bHD = 1.0, as shown in\nFigure 3. The column densities of H2 in this system were\nalso obtained as part of this global profile fit, yielding\nN(J) = 19.81, 19.13, 16.20, 14.86, and 13.97 for J = 0,\n1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, for log N(H2 ) = 19.88 \u00b1 0.1. The\nbest-fit doppler b was held at 1.0 km s\u22121 for J = 0 and 1\nunder the assumption that the bulk of the column density in H2 coincides with the cold component of carbon\nand so is thermally broadened at 115 K. These linewidths\nare consistent with the COG and profile-fitted values for\nHD at this temperature. We therefore conclude that the\nHD in this cloud plausibly arises in the same cold gas\ncomponent as the cold C and H2 (J09).\n8\n\nhttp://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/\u223crfc/vpfit.html\n\n\f4\n-4\n-5\n-6\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nfH2\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-6\n\nD/H\n\nN(HD)/2N(H2)\n\n-3\n\n-2\nGalactic Disk (Zsun)\nQ1232+082 (0.04Zsun)\nJ1439+1117 (Zsun)\nJ2123-0500 (0.5Zsun)\nFJ0812+32B (Zsun)\nD/H (Pettini et al. 2008)\n\n-7\n19\n\n20\n21\nlog [2N(H2) + N(HI)]\n\n-7\n22\n\nFig. 4.- Comparison of the our two new HD abundances (filled\ncircle for J2123-0500 and filled star for FJ0812+32B) relative to H2\nin the Galactic disk from Lacour et al.

The cross-hatched\narea refers to the axis at right and marks the CMB-derived D/H\nratio from Dunkley et al. (2009).\n\nThere is also tentative evidence for HD J = 1 in this\nsystem. Three J = 1 lines appear as excess absorption in blended profiles of unrelated absorption; these\nare Werner 0-0R(1) and Lyman 5-0R(1) and 4-0P(1).\nOnly the Lyman 4-0P(1) line at 1055.56 \u00c5 is isolated\nand is marginally detected (see Figure 3). Including all\nfour lines in the global fit yields N(1) = 13.50 \u00b1 0.12 for\nbHD = 1.0 km s\u22121 fixed at the same value as for HD\nJ = 0. If we use this tentative value for N(1) we obtain\nT01 = 26 K, colder than the corresponding C I and H2 ,\nfor which J09 inferred T < 74 K. As for J2123-0500, we\nattribute this low excitation temperature to efficient radiative decay between J = 1 and J = 0 rather than the\ngas kinetic temperature.\n4. COMPARISONS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n\nWe are now ready to compare these detections to other\nknown HD-bearing gas. HD is known to be a component\nof some dense Galactic clouds from detections in sightlines to bright stars in the disk. This population is represented in Figure 4 by the sample of Lacour et al. (2005),\nwho reported HD toward 17 Galactic OB stars (10 from\nCopernicus, 7 from FUSE). These stars have E(B-V) =\n0.1 \u2212 0.7, with molecular fractions fH2 = 0.06 \u2212 0.7.\nHD has been reported previously in two DLA systems. Varshalovich et al. (2001) and, later, Ivanchik\n\net al. (2010) reported a detection of HD with N(HD)\n15\n= 3.4+1.6\ncm\u22122 and N(H2 ) = 4.8\u00b11.0\u00d71019 cm\u22122\n\u22120.8 \u00d710\nin the DLA at z = 2.3377 toward Q1232+082, which has\nN (HI) = 20.90 \u00b1 0.08. Also, Noterdaeme et al. (2008b)\nhave detected HD in a z = 2.418 DLA toward SDSS\nJ1439+1117 with log N(H2 ) = 19.38 \u00b1 0.10, log N (HD)\n= 14.87 \u00b1 0.025, and N (HI) = 20.1 \u00b1 0.1. This HD to\nH2 ratio is also well above the Galactic disk ratio.\nWe have plotted two symbols in Figure 4 for the DLA\ntoward J2123-0500: the open symbol uses the lower\nCOG-fitted measurement for N(H2 ), while the filled circle uses the higher profile fitted value (\u00a7 2). The error\nbars on the points express the estimated statistical noise\non each measurement; the line connecting them shows\nthe larger systematic uncertainty arising from saturation\nof the H2 lines. With the higher H2 column density, the\nHD to H2 ratio in this system more closely resembles the\nother systems and the cosmological ratio of D/H.\nOur findings in the J2123-0500 and FJ0812+32B systems agree in their HD/H2 ratio with the other detections, with the striking result that all four high-redshift\nsystems lie both well above the Galactic disk value and\napparently consistent with the cosmological D/H ratio.\nThis finding is somewhat puzzling, in light of the diversity in the other properties of these systems. In their\nanalysis of Q1232+082, Ivanchik et al. (2010) explain\nthis effect by low astration at early times. However, these\nsystems show metallicities proxied from S or Zn that are\nbetween 0.04 Z\u2299 and Z\u2299 (as shown in the legend of Figure 4). It is puzzling why the infall of gas undepleted in\nD would be arranged just so that the primordial D/H ratio is maintained in four such diverse systems. It is not\nclear why low astration would be the dominant factor\nin environments that have already achieved a metallicity comparable to the Milky Way disk, as it is for three\nof the systems. Indeed, the consistency of the HD/H2\nratio across the factor of 20 in metallicity spanned by\nthese systems indicates that metallicity is perhaps only\na minor factor in determining the abundance of HD.\nEven with four systems that lie along a narrow band\nof HD/H2 ratio well above the Galactic ratio, we cannot be sure that this is the general pattern of HD/H2 in\nhigh-redshift galaxies. HD may have gone undetected in\nother DLAs where the Galactic ratio would place the HD\nbelow detection limits. Our column density sensitivity\nlimits here are N(HD) \u2243 1013 cm\u22122 , which gives a limit\nHD/2H2 = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 for J2123-0500 and 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 for\nFJ0812+32B, well below the Galactic points in the latter\ncase but above them in the former. Though in most published cases the data quality is adequate to detect HD in\nthe ratios seen here, a systematic survey of H2 -bearing\nDLAs might reveal that in some cases a Galactic ratio is\npermitted given the individual detection limits. In light\nof this \"detection bias\" we cannot yet conclude that the\nanomalous ratios of the four systems known so far are\nrepresentative of the general pattern at high redshift.\nAnother striking feature of these systems is that their\ntypical molecular fraction is fH2 \u223c 0.06 \u2212 0.3. The typical value for the Galactic disk clouds is up to ten times\nhigher, with most scattering in between fH2 = 0.2 and\n0.6 (Figure 4). In the Galactic disk, the HD is believed to\noccupy only the dense, self-shielded inner regions of the\ncloud and to be dissociated easily in the low-extinction\n\n\f5\nphotodissocation regions surrounding the cloud (Lacour\net al. 2005). By this line of reasoning, clouds with lower\nmolecular fractions should have more of their HD dissociated and should lie below the Galactic disk points\nrather than above. This effect is particularly notable for\nthe J2123-0500 system, which does not qualify as a DLA\nand has the lowest fH2 = 0.028. The mystery is then\ndeepened, in the sense that we must explain a higher HD\nto H2 ratio than in the Milky Way in clouds of similar\nmetallicity but lower total molecular abundance.\nDust is another factor that may help promote the formation of HD in these systems. All four of these HDbearing systems show evidence of dust depletion based\non dust-sensitive abundance ratios. The system toward\nJ2123-0500 shows ionization-corrected abundance ratios\nSi and Fe depleted by approximately 0.5 dex with respect to S and N (see table 4 of Milutinovic et al.). The\nF0812+32B system shows solar [S/Si] but [Zn/Fe] and\n[Cr/Zn] that indicates a high depletion of Fe (J09). The\n2175 \u00c5 dust feature is not detected in either spectrum.\nUnfortunately, beyond these abunance ratios no more\nquantitative information has been obtained on the exact\ndust-to-gas ratios or dust properties of these two systems,\nso it is not known whether the composition and size distribution of the dust is similar to that of the Galactic\ndisks. We therefore cannot correlate the HD properties\nof these systems against dust in any more detail.\nUsing a master-equation approach, Lipshtat, Biham,\n& Herbst (2004) studied the relative formation rates of\nH2 and HD under the assumption that D atoms stick to\ndust grain surfaces for slightly longer than H. They have\nfound that for a certain range of conditions, the total\nformation rate of HD can rise from \u223c 10\u22125 to & 10\u22123\ntimes that of H2 as the dust temperature rises from < 15\nK to 20 K. The effect is strongest for small grains with\na small count of binding sites to which H and D attach.\nSince this model describes the formation rates but not\nthe relative photo-dissociation rates (which are greatly\ninfluenced by self-shielding for H2 and much less so for\nHD), and since it possesses at least three free parameters for density, grain size, and grain temperature, we\n\ncannot directly use our data to constrain these models.\nWe can speculate that small grains, the right range of\ndust temperatures, or both, may together establish the\nobserved molecular abundance ratios seen in these four\nz > 2 systems. However, with the relative rates of H2\nand HD production ranging over a factor of 100 between\nTdust \u2264 15 K and 20 K for a range of grain sizes, it is\nnot clear why the four systems found so far have scatter\nso closely around the cosmological D/H.\nWe also compare our HD results against the D/H ratios seen in high-redshift DLAs as compiled by Pettini\net al. (2008), represented by open diamonds in Figure 4.\nWe note that the D/H measurements are quite precise\nand show a low scatter consistent with the CMB-derived\nvalue. In light of the precision and consistency of these\nmeasurements, it seems unnecessary to rely on HD/H2\nas a measure of cosmological D/H when the chemical\ninfluences on HD are so uncertain.\nIn light of the diversity of these systems in metallicity\nand molecular fraction, and with the discussion above\nin mind, we conclude that the balance of chemical reactions, dust properties, and local conditions are highly\nuncertain in these systems. Following this, it seems that\nthese systems pose a puzzle about interstellar chemistry\nmore effectively than they solve one about D/H. If properly understood these systems are likely to be far more\nrevealing of these uncertain chemical and environmental\neffects than they are of the primordial abundances, which\nin any case appear well constrained from direct measurements of D/H. We can hope the discovery of more such\nsystems and additional theoretical work will be able to\ndisentangle these effects and resolve these doubts.\nA portion of this work was completed while J.
