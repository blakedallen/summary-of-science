In the present work, we\nk\nshall examine various features pertinent to Bc2 and the\nassociated order parameter of a typically-layered superconductor.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nMost high Tc superconductors (HTSs) have layered\nstructures and the layered superconductivity is closely\nrelated to the behavior of the order parameter. Spatial\nvariation of the order parameter would aid us to intuitively understand various properties such as the coherence lengths of layered superconductors. On the other\nhand, the investigation of the upper critical field Bc2\nmay provide information on the coherence lengths, and\nin principle, allow the testing of existing theories (for\nexample, see Refs. 1\u20137). Hence, a study involving the\norder parameter and the upper critical field should prove\nvaluable.\nThe phenomenological continuous Ginzburg-Landau\n(CGL) model4 is convenient for a description of the order parameter and the upper critical field of layered superconductors. The coefficients in the CGL free energy\nare assumed to be spatially dependent. As a result, the\namplitude of the order parameter varies, reflecting the\nlayered nature. The amplitude of the order parameter at weakly superconducting layers may be extremely\nsmall, corresponding to a weakly linked layer system\nsimilar to the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model. On the\nother hand, when the spatial dependence is neglected,\nthe CGL model is reduced to the anisotropic GinzburgLandau (GL) model. Hence, the CGL model approaches\nthe limiting cases of the LD model and the anisotropic\nGL model.\nIn a previous work8, a set of spatial coefficients for\nthe CGL model was proposed for a layered superconducting system in which the unit cell was assumed to\ncompose of equivalently thick superconducting and insulating layers and no applied magnetic field was present.\nRecently9 , a magnetic field parallel to the layers with\n\nF =\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\nII. MODEL\n\nIn the CGL model of Koyama et al.4 , layered superconductors have been classified into three categories10,\none of which the layered HTS Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 (Bi2212)\nmay fall into. Following Ref. 8, Bi2212 shall be chosen\nas our modeling prototype for layered superconductors\nas it possesses a large anisotropy11 , and thus is suitable\nfor a detailed study that examines the relationship between the amplitude of the order parameter and the layered structure. Note, however, that a study involving\nthe phase effect of the order parameter (Josephson coupling) in Bi221212 may require a LD description1 for an\nappropriate investigation.\nThe unit cell of Bi2212 composes of two CuO2 bilayers,\nseparated by the BiO-SrO interlayer, which is referred to\nas insulating (I) layer for convenience. The two adjacent\nCuO2 planes of the bilayer (interplane distance \u223c 3 \u00c5)\nare strongly coupled so that they can be treated as a\nsingle superconducting (S) layer; therefore the distance\nbetween two superconducting layers is half the c-axis lattice constant \u223c 15 \u00c513 . Denoting the thickness of the I\nand S layers as dI and dS , respectively, we may write the\nsize of the unit cell D as D = dI + dS . The CGL free\nenergy for the system is8 ,\n\nh\u03042\n1\ndV \u03b1(T, z)|\u03a8(~r, z)| + \u03b2|\u03a8(~r, z)|4 +\n2\n2M (z)\n2\n\n1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n2ie\n\u2202\n\u2212\nAz (~r, z) \u03a8(~r, z)\n\u2202z\nh\u0304\n\n2\n\n\fh\u03042\n+\n2m(z)\n\n#\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n1 2\n2ie ~ (2)\n(2)\nA (~r, z) \u03a8(~r, z) +\nB (~r, z) ,\n\u2207 \u2212\nh\u0304\n2\u03bc0\n\nwhere \u03b10 , \u03b11 , G0 , G1 , g0 and g1 are the model parameters. These parameters are found to be related to experimental data, to each other, and to the intrinsic parameters, dI and dS (see discussions in section IV).\nLet an external magnetic field B be applied parallel to\nthe a- or b-axis which is in the y-direction. Thus, the\n~ = (Bz, 0, 0). Assumvector potential can be taken as A\nik~k *~\nr\ning \u03a8(~r, z) = e\n\u03a8(z), it follows from Eq. 1 that, by\nminimizing the free energy,\n\nwith planar vector ~r = (x, y) and vector potential\n~ r , z) = (A\n~ (2) (~r, z), Az (~r, z)).

The GL coefficient\n\u03b1(T, z) and the effective masses are taken as before (\u03b2 is\nassumed as a constant)8 :\n\u03b1(T, z) = [\u03b10 + \u03b11 cos(2\u03c0z/D)] (1 \u2212 T /Tc),\n1\n= G0 + G1 cos(2\u03c0z/D),\nM (z)\n1\n= g0 + g1 cos(2\u03c0z/D),\nm(z)\n\n(1)\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n(2c)\n\n#\n\"\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 2\nh\u0304\nk\n\u2202\nh\u03042 \u2202 1\n1\nh\u03042 \u2202 2\ny\n\u03a8(z)\n\u03a8(z) \u2212\n\u03a8(z) +\n(2eB)2 (z \u2212 z0 )2 +\n\u2212\n2M (z) \u2202z 2\n2 \u2202z M (z) \u2202z\n2m(z)\n2m(z)\n+ \u03b1(T, z)\u03a8(z) + \u03b2|\u03a8(z)|2 \u03a8(z) = 0,\n\nwith z0 = h\u0304kx /(2eB). At B = Bc2 , the superconducting\norder develops in the S layer first so that one may choose\nz0 = D/2. The high order term in Eq. 3, \u03b2|\u03a8(z)|2 \u03a8(z),\nmay be omitted since the order parameter at Bc2 is phys-\n\n(3)\n\nically small. To explore the features of the order parameter along the z direction, we assume ky = 0.

Thus, there\nis the possibility of a true 3-D superconductivity with a\nnearly uniformly distributed order parameter even in a\nhighly anisotropic superconductor. This situation can be\nobtained by just varying the temperature (see Fig. 1(a)).\n\nFor a given temperature T , the maximum magnetic field\nB which satisfies the above equation, together with the\n\u2202\nboundary conditions \u03a8(0) = \u03a8(D) and \u2202z\n\u03a8(z) z=D = 0,\ngives a point on the Bc2 -T curve. The largest B can be\nreadily achieved by treating B 2 in Eq. 4 as eigenvalue\nproblems9 .\n\nAgain, it is found that the peaks of the order parameter can be fitted by a Gaussian function. The exponential factor is the most significant part of the Gaussian fit,\nshowing that the ground state of the CGL linear equation\nis similar to that of the usual linear GL equation14,15 . We\nemphasize that this similarity, together with many reasonable results to be presented, reveals the plausibility\nof our methods of calculating Bc2 . The fitted \u03be\u22a5 (0) is\n0.96 \u00c5, which compares favorably with some experimental values of \u223c 1 \u00c516 .\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe order parameter distribution in a unit cell at different temperatures is plotted in Fig. 1(a). At low temperatures, the order parameter is mainly confined within\nthe S layer, signifying a two-dimensional (2-D) state. At\nhigh temperatures, it effectively penetrates into the I layers. Near Tc , it varies smoothly and is nearly a constant\nthroughout the unit cell, indicating a three-dimensional\n(3-D) state behavior. The present model thus correctly\naccounts for the behavior of a 2-D state at lower temperatures and a 3-D state near Tc . Note that the weak\nmodulation of the order parameter near Tc may generate\na genuine 3-D superconductor. This is different from the\nso-called 3-D region of the LD model1 , where the interlayer coherence length is much larger than the interlayer\n\nThe calculated parallel Bc2 as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 2. Near Tc , the\nfeature of Bc2 -T is square-root like while far away from\nTc , it is linear. The linear behavior in Fig. 1(b) can\nbe understood by identifying Bc2 \u221d 1/\u03be 2 while the latter is proportional to 1 \u2212 T /Tc 9 . Note that the relationship between Bc2 and T is also linear within the\n2\n\n\fk\n\n0\n,\nanisotropy GL theory, in which Bc2 (T ) = 2\u03c0\u03bek (T\u03a6)\u03be\n\u22a5 (T )\nwhere both the interlayer and in-plane coherence lengths\n\u03be\u22a5 (T ) and \u03bek (T ) are proportional to (1 \u2212 T /Tc )\u22121/2 so\n\npounds of Tl2 Ba2 Can\u22121 Cun O2n+4 (n=1,2,4), Mukaida\net al.30 reported that the upper critical field generally\ndecreases as the number of CuO2 layer increases. They\nattributed their results to the effects caused by the different thickness of the effective superconducting layers in\nTl2 Ba2 CuO6 , Tl2 Ba2 CaCu2 O8 and Tl2 Ba2 Ca3 Cu4 O12 ,\nwhose respective c-axis lattice constants are 23.2, 29.3\nand 41.9 \u00c5. Clearly, the theoretical trend presented in\nFig. 3(b) is consistent with their experimental observations.\nThe mass dependences of the parallel upper critical\nfield at zero temperature are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b).\nIn these calculations, the value of G1 (g1 ) was fixed while\nthat of G0 (g0 ) was varied to obtain the varying M\u22a5\n(mk ). It is clear that large values of both M\u22a5 and mk\nresult in a large critical field, which is consistent with the\nanisotropic GL theory, the LD model1 and the g3 theory5 .\nIt is worth mentioning that as M\u22a5 increases, we find that\nthe order parameter \u03a8(D/2) at the S layer grows while\nthat at the I layer, \u03a8(0), decreases, leading to a larger\ndifference of \u03a8(D/2) \u2212 \u03a8(0). Since 1/[\u03a8(D/2) \u2212 \u03a8(0)] is\napproximately proportional to the strength of interlayer\ncoupling between adjacent S and I layers8, thus M\u22a5 suppresses interlayer coupling. In contrast, mk is found to\nenhance interlayer coupling. We attribute this to the effect that M\u22a5 enhances the order parameter in the superconducting layer while mk suppresses it. Hence, HTS are\nintrinsically favorable for a large M\u22a5 , which corresponds\nto a weakly linked layered system.\nThe spatial variation of the order parameter at several condensation energies is plotted in Fig. 5(a). The\ntemperature is set to zero. It is obvious that the largest\nenergy corresponds to the largest order parameter in the\nS layer and that the smaller the condensed energy, the\nbroader the order parameter. Fig. 5(b) further shows\nthat the critical field increases with the condensation energy.\nUp till now, we have set the parameters \u03b10 , \u03b11 , G0 ,\nG1 , g0 and g1 (see Eq. 2) in the S layer the same as those\nin the I layer (for example, \u03b1S0 = \u03b1I0 ). We shall now consider the case where \u03b1S0 6= \u03b1I0 . The ratios of \u03b1S0 /\u03b1I0 in\nFig. 6 (a) and (b) are 20 and 2000000, respectively. The\ntemperature is zero. The non-monotonic trend (first ascending and then descending) in Fig. 6(a) is qualitatively\nconsistent with the data extracted from the numerical\nwork of Refs. 3,4.\nWhen the energy condensed in the S layer is extremely\nlarge, the system would be in an extreme 2-D state, as\nillustrated in Fig. 6(b) for different unit cell sizes. The\norder parameter totally resides in the S layer. The S layer\nfully decouples with the adjacent I layers and therefore\nthe system is in an extreme 2-D state. This interesting\n2-D behavior can be confirmed by the thickness dependence of the upper critical field. The theoretical data can\nbe fitted by an inverse relation typical of a 2-D system\n(for example, see Refs. 5,15). It is interesting to find that\nthe \u03a8(D/2)-D profile is qualitatively consistent with the\nBc2 -D trend. Such qualitative consistency can also be\n\nk\n\nthat Bc2 (T ) \u221d (1 \u2212 T /Tc ).\nSince the parallel Bc2 in Bi2212 rapidly exceeds accessible laboratory magnetic fields when the temperature is\nreduced from Tc , only the calculated data near Tc can be\ncompared with experiments17,18 (see Fig. 2). By considering a constant solution of the order parameter to Eq. 4,\none can immediately obtain a square-root Bc2 -T relation\nnear Tc . Note, however, that with open boundary conditions (OBC, \u03a8(z)|z\u2192\u00b1\u221e = 0) imposed on Eq. 4, we have\nfound that there is a linear Bc2 -T relation near Tc (see\nsolid circles in Fig. 2). The deviation from the linear behavior can be understood as a dimensional crossover (see\nRef. 19 and references therein). Moreover, when using\nspatial-independent coefficients (AGL) in the OBC simulation, we obtain a linear Bc2 -T relation in the whole\ntemperature range (as expected). Note that these calculation results are in reasonably and qualitatively agreement with experiments (which are diverse due to factors\nsuch as crystal quality, measurement methods, etc).\nThe square-root behavior near Tc indicates that the\nupward curvature of the Bc2 -T curve is absent in the\npresent simulated system. Recent studies6,20 show that\nthe upward curvature is perhaps not intrinsic. Indeed,\nsuch curvature is neither found nor obvious in the WHH\napproximation21, the d-wave theory22 and the mixed dand s-wave theory23 . Note, however, that the feature of\nthe Bc2 -T curvature is controversial7 and remains to be\ntested24 . According to Fig. 2, the curvature of Bc2 -T is\nboundary-condition dependent and thus indeed difficult\nto arrive at an absolutely conclusive conclusion. The\ncurvature may also be affected by physical phenomena25\nsuch as the spin orbit scattering (for example, see the\nmicroscopic theory in Ref. 2).\nThe calculated Bc2 at zero temperature is about 700\nTesla and is comparable with those extrapolated from experiments on Bi221217,18 and other HTS such as YBCO26\nand Bi2 Sr2 Ca2 Cu3 O10 27 . However, the experimentally\nextrapolated data might not be too reliable28 and a possible new way to detect Bc2 with Josephson plasma has\nbeen suggested29 .\nFig. 3(a) shows the spatial distribution of the order\nparameter for different D of the unit cell at zero temperature. For small D, the order parameter covers the\nentire I layer but as D increases, its penetrations into\nthe neighboring I layers become restricted and quickly\nfall to zero. The 3-D (2-D) behavior for small (large)\nunit cell is in accordance with the features reflected\nin the calculated Bc2 -T curves of Refs. 3,4. Fig. 3(b)\npresents the variation of the upper critical field with the\nsize of the unit cell at T = 0 K. The obtained critical field decreases with D, which is qualitatively consistent with the g3 model5 . Here a power law (dash line)\ncould not fit the trend well but an exponential fit (solid\nline) is acceptable. Experimentally, for the similar com3\n\n\f9\n\nfound in Figs. 6(a) and 3.\nThe extreme 2-D behavior can be further confirmed\nby the spatial distribution of the order parameter and\nthe temperature dependence of the upper critical field,\nwhich are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7 (a), the order parameter drops down sharply and is confined in the S layer\nin a large temperature range till 84.9 K. In Fig. 7 (b), a\nsquare-root relation between Bc2 and T holds over the\nwhole temperature range and this again is a typical 2-D\nbehavior, which has been reported in the literature (for\nexample, see Refs. 19,10,32,33).\n\nL.

CONCLUSION\n\nWithin a continuous Ginzburg-Landau model for layered superconductors, we have calculated the parallel upper critical field and the associated order parameter with\nrespect to the variation of the temperature, the unit cell\ndimension, the average effective masses and the GL condensation energy. Near the vicinity of Tc where the order\nparameter is nearly homogeneous, the parallel upper critical field is found to be square-root like. With a highly\nlocalized superconductivity, the same field temperature\ndependence holds over the whole temperature range. The\norder parameter at Bc2 of the linear CGL equation may\ndemonstrate a Gaussian profile, which is consistent with\nthat of the usual linear GL equation. The profile of the\nmaximum order parameter in the superconducting layer\nagainst the unit cell size may be correlated with the trend\nof the upper critical filed versus the unit cell dimension.\n\n1\n\nW.
