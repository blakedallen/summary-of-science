Conventionally, neuron oscillators\nare represented by phase-reduced models, which form a\nstandard nonlinear system [4, 5]. Intensive studies using phase models have been carried out, for example, on\nthe investigation of the patterns of synchrony that result from the type and architecture of coupling [6, 7] and\non the response of large groups of oscillators to external\nstimuli [8, 9], where the inputs to the neuron systems\nwere initially defined and the dynamics of neural populations were analyzed in detail.\nRecently, control theoretic approaches have been employed to design external stimuli that drive neurons to\nbehave in a desired way. For example, a multilinear feedback control technique has been used to control the individual phase relation between coupled oscillators [10];\na nonlinear feedback approach has been employed to engineer complex dynamic structures and synthesize delicate synchronization features of nonlinear systems [11];\nand our recent work has illustrated controllability of a\nnetwork of neurons with different natural oscillation frequencies adopting tools from geometric control theory\n[12].\nThere has been an increase in the demand for controlling not only the collective behavior of a network of\noscillators but also the behavior of each individual oscillator. It is feasible to change the spiking periods of oscillators or tune the individual phase relationship between\ncoupled oscillators by the use of electric stimuli [10, 13].\nMinimum-power stimuli that elicit spikes of a neuron at\nspecified times close to the natural spiking time were analyzed [8]. Optimal waveforms for the entrainment of\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ndasanayakei@seas.wustl.edu\njsli@seas.wustl.edu\n\nweakly forced oscillators that maximize the locking range\nhave been calculated, where first and second harmonics\nwere used to approximate the phase response curve [14].\nThese optimal controls were found mainly based on the\ncalculus of variations, which restricts the optimal solutions to the class of smooth controls and the bound of\nthe control amplitude was not taken into account.\nIn this paper, we apply the Pontryagin's maximum\nprinciple [15, 16] to derive minimum-power controls that\nspike a neuron at desired time instants. We consider both\ncases when the available control amplitude is unbounded\nand bounded. The latter is of practical importance due\nto physical limitations of experimental equipment and\nthe safety margin for neurons, e.g., the requirement of\na mild brain stimulations in neurological treatments for\nParkinson's disease and epilepsy.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we\nintroduce the phase model for spiking neurons and formulate the related optimal control problem. In Section III,\nwe derive minimum-power controls associated with specified spiking times in the absence and presence of control amplitude constraints, in which various phase models including sinusoidal PRC, SNIPER PRC, and theta\nneuron models are considered. In addition, we present\nexamples and simulations to demonstrate the resulting\noptimal control strategies.\nII.\n\nOPTIMAL CONTROL OF SPIKING\nNEURONS\n\nA periodically spiking or firing neuron can be considered as a periodic oscillator governed by the nonlinear\ndynamical equation of the form\nd\u03b8\n= f (\u03b8) + Z(\u03b8)I(t),\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the phase of the oscillation, f (\u03b8) and Z(\u03b8)\nare real-valued functions giving the neuron's baseline dynamics and its phase response, respectively, and I(t) is an\nexternal current stimulus [4]. The nonlinear dynamical\n\n\f2\nsystem described in (1) is referred to as the phase model\nfor the neuron. The assumption that Z(\u03b8) vanishes only\non isolated points and that f (\u03b8) > 0 are made so that\na full revolution of the phase is possible. By convention,\nneuron spikes occur when \u03b8 = 2n\u03c0, where n \u2208 N. In\nthe absence of any input I(t), the neuron spikes periodically at its natural frequency, while the periodicity can\nbe altered in a desired manner by an appropriate choice\nof I(t).\nIn this article, we study optimal design of neural inputs\nthat lead to the spiking of neurons at a specified time T\nafter spiking at time t = 0. In particular, we find the\nstimulus that fires a neuron with minimum power, which\nis formulated as the following optimal control problem,\nZ T\nmin\nI(t)2 dt\n(2)\nI(t)\n\n0\n\ns.t. \u03b8\u0307 = f (\u03b8) + Z(\u03b8)I(t),\n\u03b8(0) = 0, \u03b8(T ) = 2\u03c0\n|I(t)| \u2264 M, \u2200 t,\n\nWe consider the minimum-power optimal control problem of spiking neurons as formulated in (2) for various\nphase models including sinusoidal PRC, SNIPER PRC,\nand theta neuron.\n\n(5)\n\n1\nI = \u2212 \u03bbzd sin \u03b8.\n2\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting (6) into (3) and (5), the optimal control\nproblem is then transformed to a boundary value problem, which characterizes the optimal trajectories of \u03b8(t)\nand \u03bb(t),\nzd2 \u03bb\nsin2 \u03b8,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nzd2 \u03bb2\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8,\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u03c9 \u2212\n\nwith boundary conditions \u03b8(0) = 0 and \u03b8(T ) = 2\u03c0 while\n\u03bb(0) and \u03bb(T ) are unspecified.\nAdditionally, since the Hamiltonian is not explicitly\ndependent on time, the optimal triple (\u03bb, \u03b8, I) satisfies\nH(\u03bb, \u03b8, I) = c, \u2200 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T , where c is a constant. Together with (6), this yields\nzd2\nsin2 \u03b8\u03bb2 + \u03c9\u03bb = c,\n4\n\n(9)\n\nand the constant c = \u03c9\u03bb0 is obtained by the initial conditions \u03b8(0) = 0 and \u03bb(0) = \u03bb0 , which is undetermined.\nThen, the optimal multiplier can be found by solving the\nabove quadratic equation (9), which gives\nq\n2\u03c9 \u00b1 2 \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bb0 zd2 sin2 \u03b8\n,\n(10)\n\u03bb=\nzd2 sin2 \u03b8\n\nSinusoidal PRC Phase Model\n\nConsider the sinusoidal PRC model,\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u03c9 + zd sin \u03b8 * I(t),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the natural oscillation frequency of the neuron\nand zd is a model-dependent constant. The neuron described by this phase model spikes periodically with the\nperiod T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9 in the absence of any external input,\ni.e., I(t) = 0.\n1.\n\n\u2202H\n= \u2212\u03bbzd I cos \u03b8,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nand \u2202H\n\u2202I = 2I + \u03bbzd sin \u03b8 = 0. Hence, the optimal current\nI satisfies\n\n\u2212\n\nMINIMUM-POWER STIMULUS FOR\nSPECIFIED FIRING TIME\n\nA.\n\n\u03bb\u0307 = \u2212\n\n\u03bb\u0307 =\n\nwhere M > 0 is the amplitude bound of the current stimulus I(t). Note that instantaneous or arbitrarily delayed\nspiking of a neuron is possible if I(t) is unbounded, i.e.,\nM = \u221e; however, the range of feasible spiking periods\nof a neuron described as in (1) is restricted with a finite\nM . We consider both unbounded and bounded cases.\nIII.\n\nwhere \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier. The necessary optimality conditions according to the Maximum Principle\ngive\n\nSpiking Neurons with Unbounded Control\n\nThe optimal current profile can be derived by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle [15]. Given the optimal control\nproblem as in (2), we form the control Hamiltonian\nH = I 2 + \u03bb(\u03c9 + zd sin \u03b8 * I),\n\n(4)\n\nand the optimal trajectory of \u03b8 follows\nq\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2213 \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bb0 zd2 sin2 \u03b8,\n\n(11)\n\nby plugging \u03bb in (10) into (7). Integrating (11) by separation of variables, we find the spiking time T with respect\nto the initial condition \u03bb0 ,\n\u0011 Z 2\u03c0\n1 \u0010 q\n1\nd\u03b8, (12)\nT = F 2\u03c0, \u03bb\u03c90 zd =\n\u221a 2\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u2212\u03c9\u03bb0 zd2 sin2 \u03b8\n0\nwhere F denotes the elliptic integral. Note that we\nchoose the positive sign in (11) since the negative velocity\nindicates the backward phase evolution. Therefore, given\na desired spiking time T of the neuron, the initial value,\n\u03bb0 , corresponding to the optimal trajectory of the multiplier can be found via the one-to-one relation in (12).\nConsequently, the optimal trajectories of \u03b8 and \u03bb can be\neasily computed by evolving (7) and (8) forward in time.\n\n\f3\nT < 2\u03c0/\u03c9 (T > 2\u03c0/\u03c9), we see that the required minimum power increases if we move away from the natural\nspiking time.\nThe minimum-power stimulus I \u2217 as in (13) plotted\nwith respect to time and phase for various spiking times\nT = 3, 5, 10, 12 with \u03c9 = 1 and zd = 1 are shown in\nFIG. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The respective optimal\ntrajectories of \u03bb(\u03b8) and \u03b8(t) for these spiking times are\npresented in FIG. 3(c) and 3(d).\n\n3\n2\n\nMultiplier (\u03bb)\n\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\nPhase (\u03b8)\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n2\u03c0\n\nFIG. 1. Extremals of sinusoidal PRC system with zd = 1 and\n\u03c9=1\n\nPlugging (10) into (6), we obtain the optimal feedback\nlaw\nq\n\u2212\u03c9 + \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bb0 zd2 sin2 \u03b8\nI\u2217 =\n,\n(13)\nzd sin \u03b8\nwhich drives the neuron from \u03b8(0) = 0 to \u03b8(T ) = 2\u03c0 with\nminimum power.\nThe feasibility of spiking the neuron at a desired time\nT largely depends on the initial value of the multiplier,\n\u03bb0 . It is clear from (12) and (11) that a complete 2\u03c0 revolution is impossible when \u03bb0 > \u03c9/zd2. This fact also can\nbe seen from FIG. 1, where the system evolution defined\nby (7) and (8) for zd = 1 and \u03c9 = 1 with respect to different \u03bb0 values (\u03b8 = 0 axis) is illustrated. When \u03bb0 = 0,\naccording to equation (12), the spiking period is equal to\nthe natural spiking period, 2\u03c0/\u03c9, and no external stimulus needs to be applied, i.e., I \u2217 (t) = 0, \u2200t \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0/\u03c9].\nSince, from (12), T is a monotonically increasing function of \u03bb0 for fixed \u03c9 and zd and, from (11), the average\nphase velocity decreases when \u03bb0 increases, the spiking\ntime T > 2\u03c0/\u03c9 for \u03bb0 > 0 and T < 2\u03c0/\u03c9 for \u03bb0 < 0.\nFIG. 2 shows variation of the spiking time T with the \u03bb0\ncorresponding to the optimal trajectories for different \u03c9\nvalues with zd = 1.\nThe relation between the spiking time T and required\nRT\nminimum power E = min 0 I 2 (t)dt is evident via a simple sensitivity analysis [17]. Since a small change in the\ninitial condition, d\u03b8, and a small change in the initial\ntime, dt, result in a small change in power according to\ndE = \u03bb(t)d\u03b8 \u2212 H(t)d\u03b8, it follows that [17]\n\u2212\n\n\u2202E\n= H = c = \u03c9\u03bb0 .\n\u2202t\n\n(14)\n\nThis implies that E increases with initial time t for \u03bb0 < 0\nand decreases for \u03bb0 > 0. Since the increment of the initial time is equivalent to the decrement of spiking time\nT , \u2202E/\u2202T = \u03c9\u03bb0 . Since \u03bb0 < 0 (\u03bb0 > 0) corresponds to\n\nSpiking Neurons with Bounded Control\n\nIn practice, the amplitude of stimuli in physical systems are limited, so we consider spiking the sinusoidal\nneuron with bounded control amplitude, namely, in the\noptimal control problem (2), |I(t)| \u2264 M < \u221e for all\nt \u2208 [0, T ], where T is the desired spiking period. In this\ncase, there exists a range of feasible spiking periods depending on the value of M , in contrast to the previous\ncase where any desired spiking time is feasible.

Therefore, the \u03bb0 for the shortest spiking time with control I \u2217\nsatisfying |I \u2217 (t)| \u2264 M can be calculated by substituting\nI \u2217 = M and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 to the equation (13), and then from\n(12) we obtain this shortest spiking period\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nI\u2217\nq\nTmin =\n.\n(17)\n0\n\u03c9 2 + zd M (zd M + 2\u03c9) sin2 (\u03b8)\n\u2217\n\nM\nI\nNote that Tmin\n< Tmin\n. According to (3) when M \u2265\n\u03c9/zd, arbitrarily large spiking times can be achieved by\nmaking \u03b8\u0307 arbitrary close to zero. Therefore we consider\ntwo cases for M \u2265 \u03c9/zd and M < \u03c9/zd.\nCase I: M \u2265 \u03c9/zd . Since I \u2217 takes the maximum\nvalue at \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2 for \u03bb0 > 0, we have |I \u2217 | \u2264 (\u03c9 \u2212\np\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bb0 zd2 )/zd , which leads to |I \u2217 | < \u03c9/zd \u2264 M for\n\u03bb0 > 0. This implies that I \u2217 is the minimum-power\ncontrol for any desired spiking time T > 2\u03c0/\u03c9 when\nI\u2217\nM \u2265 \u03c9/zd, and hence for any spiking time T \u2265 Tmin\n.\nVariation of the maximum value of the control I \u2217 with\nspiking time T for \u03c9 = 1 and zd = 1 is\u2217 depicted in FIG. 4.\nM\nI\nShorter spiking times T \u2208 [Tmin\n, Tmin\n) are feasible but,\ndue to the bound M , can not be achieved by I \u2217 since\nit requires a control with amplitude greater than M for\nsome t \u2208 [0, T ]. However, these spiking times can be optimally achieved by applying controls switching between\nI \u2217 and IT\u2217 min .\nM\nI\u2217\nLet the desired spiking time T \u2208 [Tmin\n, Tmin\n). Then,\n\nthere exist two angles \u03b81 = sin\u22121 [\u22122M \u03c9/(zdM 2 +\nzd \u03c9\u03bb0 )] and \u03b82 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b81 where I \u2217 meets the bound M .\nWhen \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), I \u2217 > M and we take I(\u03b8) = M for \u03b8 \u2208\n[\u03b81 , \u03b82 ]. The Hamiltonian of the system when \u03b8 \u2208 [\u03b81 , \u03b82 ]\nis then, from (4), H = M 2 +\u03bb(\u03c9+zd sin \u03b8 M ). If the triple\n(\u03bb, \u03b8, M ) is optimal, then H is a constant, which gives\n\u03bb = (H \u2212 M 2 )/(\u03c9 + zd M sin \u03b8). This multiplier satisfies\nthe adjoint equation (5), and therefore I(\u03b8) = M is optimal for \u03b8 \u2208 [\u03b81 , \u03b82 ]. Similarly, by symmetry, I \u2217 < \u2212M\nwhen \u03b8 \u2208 [\u03b83 , \u03b84 ], where \u03b83 = \u03c0 + \u03b81 and\n\u03b84 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b81 , if\nM\nI\u2217\nthe desired spiking time T \u2208 [Tmin\n, Tmin\n).

In fact, by a coordinate transformation, \u03b8(\u03c6) =\n\nIn this paper, we studied various phase-reduced models\nthat describe the dynamics of a neuron system. We considered the design of minimum-power stimuli for spiking a\nneuron at a specified time instant and formulated this as\nan optimal control problem. We investigated both cases\nwhen the control amplitude is unbounded and bounded,\nfor which we found analytic expressions of optimal feedback control laws. In particular for the bounded control\ncase, we characterized the ranges of possible spiking periods in terms of the control bound. Moreover, minimumpower stimuli for steering any nonlinear oscillators of the\nform as in (1) between desired states can be derived following the steps presented in this article. In addition,\nthe charge-balanced constraint [18] can be readily incorporated into this framework as well.\nThe optimal control of a single neuron system investigated in this work illustrates the fundamental limit of\nspiking a neuron with external stimuli and provides a\nbenchmark structure that enables us to study optimal\ncontrol of a spiking neural network with different individual oscillation frequencies. Our recent work [12] proved\nthat simultaneous spiking of a network of neurons is possible; however, optimal control of such a spiking neural network has not been studied. We finally note that\nalthough one-dimensional phase models are reasonably\naccurate to describe the dynamics of neurons, studying higher dimensional models such as that of HodgkinHuxley is essential for more accurate computation of optimal neural inputs.\n\n[1] P.
