Introduction\nThe banded structures at the surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn\nare associated with prograde and retrograde zonal flows. In both\nplanets, a large amplitude eastward equatorial jet (150 m.s\u22121\nfor Jupiter and 300 m.s\u22121 for Saturn) is flanked by multiple alternating zonal winds of weaker amplitudes (typically tens of\nm.s\u22121 ). This alternating pattern is observed up to the polar region (Porco et al., 2003).\nTwo competing types of models have tried to address the\nquestion of what drives the zonal winds and how deep they\nreach into the planet (see the review of Vasavada and Showman, 2005). In the \"weather layer\" hypothesis, zonal winds are\nconfined to a very thin layer near the cloud level. Such shallow models, that rely on global circulation codes, successfully\nrecover the observed alternating banded structures of zonal\nflows (e.g. Williams, 1978; Cho and Polvani, 1996). While\nearlier shallow models mostly produce rather retro- than prograde equatorial jet, this has been hampered in most recent\napproaches by adding additional forcing mechanisms, such as\nmoist radiative relaxation at the equator (Scott and Polvani,\n2008) or condensation of water vapor (Lian and Showman,\n2010). In the \"deep models\", the zonal winds are supposed to\nextend over the whole molecular envelope (\u223c 104 km). The direction, the amplitude and the number of jets are reproduced,\nprovided thin shells are assumed and convection is strongly\ndriven (Heimpel et al., 2005).\n\u2217 Principal\n\ncorresponding author\nEmail address: gastine@mps.mpg.de (T. Gastine)\n\nPreprint submitted to Icarus\n\nThe in-situ measurement by the Galileo probe further stimulated the discussion. They showed that the velocity increases\nup to 170 m.s\u22121 over the sampling depth between 0.4 and 22\nbars (Atkinson et al., 1997). Though this result indicates that\nthe amplitude of zonal winds increases well below the cloud\nlevel, it hardly proves the \"deep models\" since the probe has\nmerely scratched the outermost 150 kms of Jupiter's atmosphere (Vasavada and Showman, 2005).\nInterior models of the giants planets suggest that Hydrogen\nbecomes metallic at about 1.5 Mbar, corresponding roughly to\n0.85 Jupiter's radius and 0.6 Saturn's radius (Guillot, 1999;\nGuillot et al., 2004; Nettelmann et al., 2008). This has traditionally been used to independently model the dynamics\nof the molecular layer without regarding the conducting region. Lorentz forces and increasing density would prevent these\nstrong zonal winds to penetrate significantly into the molecular\nlayer, where timescales thus tend to be slower. However, shock\nwaves experiments suggest that the increase of electrical conductivity is more gradual rather than abrupt (Nellis et al., 1996;\nNellis, 2000). Liu et al. (2008) therefore argue that zonal jets\nmust be confined to a thin upper layer (0.96 Jupiter's radius\nand 0.86 Saturn's radius), since deep zonal winds would already generate important Ohmic dissipation incompatible with\nthe observed surface flux. However, Glatzmaier (2008) claimed\nthat the kinetic model of Liu et al. (2008) is too simplistic as\nthis does not allow the magnetic field to adjust the differential\nrotation, which would severely reduce Ohmic dissipation.\nNotwithstanding this open discussion, the fact that deep\nmodels successfully reproduce the primary properties of the\nOctober 29, 2018\n\n\fzonal jets speaks in their favour. These models rely on 3-D numerical simulations of rapidly rotating shells (e.g. Christensen,\n2001, 2002; Heimpel et al., 2005). When convection is strongly\ndriven, the nonlinear inertial term u*\u2207u becomes influential and\ngives rises to Reynolds stresses, a statistical correlation between\nthe convective flow components that allows to feed energy into\nzonal winds (e.g. Plaut et al., 2008).\nMost of these simulations use the Boussinesq approximation,\nwhich assumes homogeneous reference state. This seems acceptable for terrestrial planets, but becomes rather dubious for\ngas planets, where for example the density increases by four\norders of magnitude (Guillot, 1999; Anufriev et al., 2005).\nThe anelastic approximation we adopt here, provides a more\nrealistic framework, which allows to incorporate the background density stratification, while filtering out fast acoustic\nwaves (Lantz and Fan, 1999). Jones and Kuzanyan (2009) presented 3-D anelastic simulations that showed many interesting\ndifferences with the Boussinesq results. The zonal flows still remain large-scale and deep-seated but the local small-scale convection is severely affected by compressibility and strongly depends on radius. While the main equatorial band remains a robust common feature, it seems more difficult to get stable multiple high latitude jets, even in the most extreme parameters.\nKaspi et al. (2009) used a modified anelastic approach neglecting viscous heating but including a more realistic equation of\nstate. In their model, the zonal flows show a more pronounced\nvariation in the direction of the rotation axis than in the work\nof Jones and Kuzanyan (2009). Evonuk (2008) and Glatzmaier\net al. (2009) pointed out that compressibility adds a new vorticity source that could potentially help to generate Reynolds\nstresses that, in fine, maintain zonal flows.\nFollowing theses recent studies, we focus here on the effects\nof compressibility on rapidly rotating convection. The main\naim of this paper is to determine the exact influence of the density background on the driving of zonal flows. To this end, we\nhave conducted a systematic parametric study for various density stratifications and solutions that span weakly supercritical\nto strongly nonlinear convection.\nIn section 2, we introduce the anelastic model and the numerical methods. Section 3 presents the results, starting with\nconvection close to the onset and then progressing into the nonlinear regime. In section 4, we concentrate on the zonal winds\nmechanism and related scaling laws, before concluding in section 5.\n\nas density, temperature and pressure are decomposed into the\nsum of an adiabatic reference state (quantities with overbars)\nand a perturbation (primed quantities):\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u0304 + \u03c10\n\n;\n\nT = T\u0304 + T 0\n\n;\n\np = p\u0304 + p0 .\n\n(1)\n\nWhen assuming g \u221d 1/r2 , the polytropic and adiabatic reference state is given by (see Jones et al., 2011, for further details)\nT\u0304 (r) =\n\nc0\n+ 1 \u2212 c0\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7)r\n\nand \u03c1\u0304(r) = T\u0304 m ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith\nc0 =\n\n!\nN\u03c1\n\u03b7\nexp\n\u22121\n1\u2212\u03b7\nm\n\nwith\n\nN\u03c1 = ln\n\n\u03c1\u0304(ri )\n.\n\u03c1\u0304(ro )\n\n(3)\n\nHere T\u0304 and \u03c1\u0304 are the background temperature and density, m is\nthe polytropic index, \u03b7 = ri /ro is the aspect ratio and N\u03c1 corresponds to the number of density scale heights covered over\nthe layer.

As stated\nby Jones and Kuzanyan (2009), in anelastic simulations with\nlarge density stratification, viscous heating plays a significant\nrole in the global energy balance.

The anelastic equations\nWe consider thermal convection of an ideal gas in a spherical shell of outer radius ro and inner radius ri , rotating at a\nconstant frequency \u03a9 about the z axis. Being interested in the\ndynamics of the molecular region of gas giants, we assume that\nthe mass is concentrated in the inner part, resulting in a gravity\ng \u221d 1/r2 . We employ the anelastic approximation following\nBraginsky and Roberts (1995), Gilman and Glatzmaier (1981)\nand Lantz and Fan (1999). Thermodynamical quantities, such\n2\n\n\fmainly on entropy diffusion rather than on temperature diffusion (Braginsky and Roberts, 1995; Lantz and Fan, 1999; Jones\nand Kuzanyan, 2009; Jones et al., 2011). That is why, the turbulent heat flux has been assumed to be proportional to the entropy gradient as in the mixing-length theory (Vitense, 1953;\nB\u00f6hm-Vitense, 1958).\nIn addition to the two anelastic parameters (the polytropic\nindex m and the density stratification N\u03c1 ) and the aspect ratio\n\u03b7, the three non-dimensional parameters that control the system\nof equations (4), (5) and (7) are the Ekman number\nE=\n\n\u03bd\n,\n\u03a9d2\n\n(9)\n\nthe Prandtl number\n\u03bd\nPr = ,\n\u03ba\n\n(10)\n\nFigure 1: Radial profile of g|dsc /dr| for different background density stratifications N\u03c1 = [10\u22122 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nand the Rayleigh number\nRa =\n\ng0 d3 \u2206s\n,\nc p \u03bd\u03ba\n\n(11)\n\n+\n*\n3N\u03c1\ndsc\n=\ng\n\u0001\n\u0001.\n\u2212N\n\u03c1\ndr \u03c1\n1\u2212e\n1 + \u03b7eN\u03c1 /2 + \u03b72 eN\u03c1\n\ng0 being the gravity at the outer radius, c p the specific heat, and\n\u03ba the thermal diffusivity. This definition of the Rayleigh number is based on the entropy jump over the layer and on values\nof the physical quantities at the outer boundary. However, for\nanalysing where convection sets in first, the radial dependence\nof the diffusive entropy gradient has to be considered. This can\nbe cast into a depth-dependent Rayleigh number:\nR=\n\ngd4 dsc\n,\nc p \u03bd\u03ba dr\n\nwhere sc is the solution of (see Jones et al., 2011)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2207 * \u03c1\u0304T\u0304 \u2207sc = 0.\n\n(15)\n\nMoreover, in the limit of small viscosity and thermal diffusivity, the force balance is expected to become independent on viscosity (low Ekman number). Therefore, following Christensen\n(2002) and Christensen and Aubert (2006), it is more relevant\nto consider a modified Rayleigh number that does not depend\nanymore on diffusivities, defined as\n*\n+\n1\ndsc\ng\n= hRi\u03c1 E2 Pr\u22121 .\n(16)\nhRa\u2217 i\u03c1 =\ndr \u03c1\nc p \u03a92\n\n(12)\n\nTo get a non-dimensional measure of the radial heat transport\nthat is also independent of the thermal diffusivity, we use a modified Nusselt number\n\n(13)\n\nIn our simulations, thermal and viscous diffusivities are assumed to be constant, but gravity and entropy vary with radius.\nGravity is decreasing outward (as g \u221d 1/r2 ), but the entropy\ngradient is inversely proportional to \u03c1\u0304 T\u0304 (Eq. 13) and therefore\nincreases rapidly toward the surface for large density stratifications. As a consequence, we can see on Fig. 1 that this local Rayleigh number increases outward for density stratification\nlarger than 3, while it increases downward for weaker density\nstratifications.\nSeveral authors argued that Rayleigh numbers at mid-depth\nmay offer a more meaningful reference value (e.g. Unno et al.,\n1960; Gough et al., 1976; Glatzmaier and Gilman, 1981). Here\nwe follow Kaspi et al. (2009), who suggest to use a massweighted average defined as\n+\n*\ndsc\nd4\ng\n,\n(14)\nhRi\u03c1 =\nc p \u03bd\u03ba\ndr \u03c1\n\nNu\u2217 =\n\nq\n\u03c1T \u03a9d2 (ds\n\nc /dr)\n\n= Nu E Pr\u22121 .\n\n(17)\n\nwhere q is the heat flux. Once the simulation has reached the\nnonlinear saturation, the time-average of this modified Nusselt\nnumber should become constant with radius as there is no internal heat source in the system. Therefore, there is no need to\nconsider mass-weighted average of this parameter.\nFinally, it is also useful to analyse our simulations in terms\nof an alternate Rayleigh number based on the heat flux rather\nthan on the entropy contrast \u2206s\nRa\u2217q =\n\nqg\n.\nc p \u03c1T \u03a93 d2\n\n(18)\n\nThis flux-based Rayleigh number can be related to the modified\nNusselt number as follows\n\nthe R average is defined as h* * * i\u03c1\n=\nRwhere\nro\nro\n2\n2\n(* * * )\u03c1\u0304r dr/ r \u03c1\u0304r dr (Kaspi et al., 2009).\nThis new\nri\ni\ndefinition of the Rayleigh number can be related to the usual\none (Eq. 11), by the coefficient hg|ds/dr|c i\u03c1 , that has an\nanalytical solution for a polytropic index of 2\n\nRa\u2217q =\n\ng dsc\nNu\u2217 = Ra\u2217 Nu\u2217 .\nc p \u03a92 dr\n\n(19)\n\nOnce again, this number varies with radius, and therefore it\nis useful to consider the mass-weighted average counterpart of\nthis quantity\n3\n\n\fhRa\u2217q i\u03c1 = hRa\u2217 i\u03c1 Nu\u2217 .\n\nTable 1: Values of the critical Rayleigh numbers (and flux-based counterparts)\nand azimuthal wavenumbers for different background density stratifications\n(with E = 10\u22124 and Pr = 1).\n\n(20)\n\n2.2. The numerical method\nThe numerical simulations of this study have been carried out\nwith a modified version of the code MagIC (Wicht, 2002). The\nnew anelastic version has been tested and validated against different compressible convection and dynamo benchmarks (Jones\net al., 2011). To solve the system of equations (4), (5) and (7) in\nspherical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), the mass flux \u03c1\u0304u is decomposed\ninto a poloidal and a toroidal contribution\n\u03c1\u0304u = \u2207 \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 We r ) + \u2207 \u00d7 Ze r ,\n\nN\u03c1\n\u22122\n\n10\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n(21)\n\n2.3. Boundary conditions\nIn all the simulations presented in this study, we have assumed constant entropy and stress-free boundary conditions for\nthe velocity at both limits. Under the anelastic approximation,\nthe non-penetrating stress-free boundary conditions is modified\ncompared to the usual Boussinesq one as it now involves the\nbackground density\n\nfor\n\nr = [ri , ro ].\n\n5\n\n1.739 \u00d7 10\n5.175 \u00d7 105\n1.141 \u00d7 106\n1.529 \u00d7 106\n1.852 \u00d7 106\n2.341 \u00d7 106\n\nhRa\u2217q i\u03c1\n\u22127\n\n1.739 \u00d7 10\n5.175 \u00d7 10\u22127\n1.141 \u00d7 10\u22126\n1.529 \u00d7 10\u22126\n1.852 \u00d7 10\u22126\n2.341 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\nmcrit\n\u22127\n\n2.666 \u00d7 10\n8.275 \u00d7 10\u22127\n1.496 \u00d7 10\u22126\n1.326 \u00d7 10\u22126\n9.023 \u00d7 10\u22127\n5.727 \u00d7 10\u22127\n\n21\n34\n53\n72\n83\n93\n\njump between the 1 bar level and the bottom of the molecular region corresponds to N\u03c1 ' 8.5 (e.g Guillot, 1999; Nettelmann et al., 2008). For numerical reasons, we cannot afford\nto increase N\u03c1 beyond 5. However, since the density gradient\ndecreases rapidly with depth, N\u03c1 = 5 covers already 99% of\nthe molecular envelope when starting at the metallic transition.\nThe remaining rather thin upper atmosphere (roughly 500 kms)\nmay involve additional physical effects such as radiative transfer, weather effects or insolation, that we do not include in our\nmodel. For each of the stratifications used in this study, the\nRayleigh number has been varied, starting from close to onset up to 140 times the critical value. Altogether more than\n140 simulations have been computed, each running for at least\n0.2 viscous time ensuring that the nonlinear saturation has been\nreached (see Table 2).\nThe numerical resolution increases from (Nr = 73, `max =\n85) for Boussinesq runs close to onset to (Nr = 161, `max =\n341) for the more demanding highly supercritical simulations\nwith strong stratification. In the latter cases, we have resolved\nto imposing a two-fold or a four-fold azimuthal symmetry, effectively solving for only half or a quarter of the spherical shell,\nrespectively. A comparison of testruns with or without symmetries showed no significant statistical differences.\n\nwhere W and Z are the poloidal and toroidal potentials. W, Z, p\nand s are then expanded in spherical harmonic functions up to\ndegree `max in the angular variables \u03b8 and \u03c6 and in Chebyshev\npolynomials up to degree Nr in the radial direction. The equations for W and Z are obtained by taking the horizontal part of\nthe divergence and the radial component of the curl of Eq. (5),\nrespectively. A more exhaustive description of the numerical\nmethod and spectral transforms involved in the computation can\nbe found in (Gilman and Glatzmaier, 1981) and in (Christensen\nand Wicht, 2007).\n\n!\n!\n\u2202 1\n\u2202 1 \u2202W\n=\nZ\n=0\n\u2202r r2 \u03c1\u0304 \u2202r\n\u2202r r2 \u03c1\u0304\n\nRa\u2217q\n\nRacrit\n\n(22)\n\nThe non-penetrating condition of the radial motion is not affected by the anelastic approximation and remains ur = 0 (or\nW = 0) at both limits.\n\n3.1. Onset of convection\nThe linear stability analysis by Jones et al. (2009) shows that\ndensity stratification can have a significant influence both on\nthe value of the critical Rayleigh number and on the location of\nthe first unstable mode. To facilitate the comparison between\ndifferent density contrasts, we have therefore computed the corresponding critical Rayleigh numbers (Tab. 1). The values have\nbeen obtained by trial and error, monitoring the growth or decay\nof initial disturbances at various Rayleigh numbers.\nFigure 2 emphasises how the location of the convective instability changes when N\u03c1 is increased. In the nearly Boussinesq\ncase (N\u03c1 = 10\u22122 ), convection sets in near the tangent cylinder.\nThe convective columns show a strong prograde spiralling, typical for rapidly rotating convection at a moderate Prandtl number (e.g. Zhang, 1992). For N\u03c1 = 1, the wavenumber increases\nbut the instability stays attached to the inner boundary. However, when increasing N\u03c1 further, it moves outward and is progressively confined to the very thin outermost region.\nThis behaviour can be explained by the depth-dependent\nof buoyancy expressed via the modified Rayleigh number\n\n3. Physical properties of compressible convection\nWe have fixed the aspect ratio \u03b7 = 0.6 to the lower value\nsuggested for the molecular to metallic hydrogen transition in\nJupiter (0.85 R J ) and Saturn (0.6 RS ) (e.g. Liu et al., 2008). This\nlimits the numerical difficulties associated with thinner shells\nand therefore allows to reach higher density stratification. The\nEkman number is kept fixed at E = 10\u22124 , which is larger than\nthe most extreme values chosen by Jones and Kuzanyan (2009)\nbut allows us to conduct a large number of simulations. Following previous Boussinesq studies (e.g. Christensen, 2002),\nthe Prandtl number is set to 1, while the polytropic index is\nm = 2 following Jones and Kuzanyan (2009). Being mostly interested in the effects of density stratification on zonal flow generation, we have performed simulations at five different values\nof N\u03c1 (10\u22122 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that span the range from nearly Boussinesq to a density contrast of 150. In the gas giants, the density\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: Radial component of the velocity ur in the equatorial plane for different density stratifications very close to onset of convection (less than 5% over the\ncritical Rayleigh number). Outward flows are rendered in red, inward flows in blue, dimensionless radial velocities are expressed in terms of Reynolds numbers.\n\n(Eq. 12). Figure 2 demonstrates how larger buoyancy values\nare more and more confined close to the outer boundary as N\u03c1\ngrows. This implies a decrease in radial lengthscale, which\ngoes along with a rapid increase in wavenumber. This allows\nthe instability to maintain a more or less spherical cross section\n(Glatzmaier and Gilman, 1981; Jones et al., 2009).\n3.2. Convection regimes\nThe properties of rotating thermal convection have been explored extensively under the Boussinesq approximation (e.g.\nZhang, 1992; Grote and Busse, 2001; Christensen, 2001). The\nrespective studies show that when the Rayleigh number is increased beyond onset distinct regimes with different temporal behavior are encountered. Here we explore whether these\nregimes are retained in the presence of density stratification.\nFigure 3 illustrates the time dependence in the temporal variation characteristic for the different regimes at N\u03c1 = 2 and in\nFig. 4 we attempt to show how the regimes boundaries change\non increasing N\u03c1 . At N\u03c1 = 2, we still find the same regimes\nidentified in the Boussinesq simulations. Very close to onset,\nthe solutions simply drift in azimuth due to its Rossby wave\ncharacter (Busse, 1994) and the kinetic energy becomes stationary (Fig. 3a). The drift is a consequence of both the height\nchange of the container and the background density stratification encountered by the convective instability. Its amplitude and\ndirection depends on the chosen stratification (Evonuk, 2008;\nGlatzmaier et al., 2009). At a still rather small supercriticality,\nthe solution starts to vacillate in amplitude, while retaining its\ncolumnar form. Figure 3b demonstrates that the poloidal and\ntoroidal kinetic energies oscillate in phase and have a comparable magnitude.\n\nFigure 4: Regime diagram (Ra, N\u03c1 ) displaying how the different nonlinear\nregimes of rotating compressible convection depend on supercriticality and\ndensity stratification. Each symbol corresponds to one simulation computed\nin this study. The five black triangles denote the localisations of the five simulations emphasised in Fig. 3.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Time series of the kinetic energy for different simulations with a moderate density contrast (N\u03c1 = 2). In each panel, the dotted black line corresponds\nto the total kinetic energy, while solid black line and solid gray line correspond respectively to toroidal an poloidal parts of the kinetic energy. The simulation\ndisplayed in (a) corresponds to Ra = 1.145 \u00d7 106 (1.004\u00d7 supercritical), (b) to Ra = 1.2 \u00d7 106 (1.05\u00d7 supercritical), (c) to Ra = 2.2 \u00d7 106 (1.93\u00d7 supercritical), (d)\nto Ra = 8 \u00d7 106 (7\u00d7 supercritical) and (e) to Ra = 2 \u00d7 107 (17.5\u00d7 supercritical). These five simulations can be localized in the regime diagram displayed in Fig. 4.\n\nA further increase of the Rayleigh number leads to a third\nregime with a more chaotic time-dependence (Fig. 3c). The\nzonal flow production is already so efficient that the toroidal\nenergy dominates the kinetic energy budget. Since the poloidal\nflow is directly driven by convective up- and downwellings, its\namplitude can serve as a proxy for the convective flow vigor.\nZonal flows are the axisymmetric contribution of toroidal flow\nand already dominate the toroidal energy here. Both the convective and the zonal flows display large amplitude modulations. A fourth regime with intermittent nearly oscillatory convection is encountered once Ra & 4 \u00d7 Rac (panel (d) in Fig. 3).\nHere, the zonal flow periodically becomes so large that the associated shear disrupts the convective structures (see for further details Christensen, 2001; Grote and Busse, 2001; Simitev\nand Busse, 2003; Heimpel and Aurnou, 2012). The Reynolds\nstresses then decrease and the zonal flow cannot be maintained\nany more against viscous forces. The convection recovers once\nthe zonal flows amplitude has decreased sufficiently. A similar but less regular competition may also cause the large variation in the chaotic regime. Typical for this intermittent regime,\nwhich has mainly been observed in Boussinesq simulations but\nhas also been reported in some anelastic simulations of turbulent convection in solar-like stars (Ballot et al., 2007), is that the\nconvective features typically occupy only an azimuthal fraction\nof the volume. Finally, in the strongly supercritical regime, convection becomes once more chaotic but the variations are much\nsmaller than in the first chaotic regime (Fig. 3e). Convective\n\nfeatures now fill the whole spherical shell and efficiently drive\nstrong zonal winds.\nFor N\u03c1 = 2 we thus find the following regime succession also\ntypical for Boussinesq convection at Pr . 1 (Grote and Busse,\n2001):\nDrifting \u2192 Vacillating \u2192 Chaotic \u2192 Intermittent \u2192 Chaotic .\nThe regime diagram displayed in Fig. 4 shows that the first\nchaotic and the intermittent regime tend to vanish for larger values of N\u03c1 . For N\u03c1 = [4 \u2212 5], we found neither the first chaotic\nnor the intermittent regime, which could mean that both have\nretreated to a rather small region of the parameter space or are\nmissing altogether. Due to the lack of an intermittent regime,\nhowever, the separation of the first and second chaotic regime is\nless clear cut, being based only on the variation amplitude. The\nnarrowing of the regime diagram for increasing density stratification was also found in 3-D simulations of convection in\nrapidly rotating isothermal spherical shells (Tortorella, 2005).\nThe large amplitude oscillations in the first chaotic and the\nintermittent regime require a more global interaction between\nconvection and zonal flow. When the density stratification is\nincreased, however, the solution becomes more small scale and\nchaotic and the convective columns progressively loose their\nintegrity in the direction of the rotation axis (Glatzmaier et al.,\n2009; Jones and Kuzanyan, 2009). This likely prevents the required more global interaction and the related regimes at larger\ndensity stratification.\n6\n\n\f3.3. Flow properties\nThe background density stratification causes significant\nchanges in the convective flow that we discuss first before describing the zonal flows in section 3.3.2.\n3.3.1. Convective flows\nFigure 5 illustrates how the radial velocity varies with depth\nin a strongly-stratified anelastic simulation at N\u03c1 = 5. The\nRayleigh number of Ra = 8 \u00d7 106 guarantees that the solution\nis safely located in the second chaotic regime. Deeper within\nthe interior, the convection is characterized by larger azimuthal\nlength scales and lower amplitudes. With increasing radius,\nthe azimuthal length scale decreases, while the amplitude increases. The convective features remain roughly aligned with\nthe rotation axis at any radius. The changes in length scale are\ncoupled to the background density profile as the density scale\nheight defined by H\u03c1 = \u2212(d ln \u03c1\u0304/dr)\u22121 is a good proxy for the\ntypical size of the convective eddies. At N\u03c1 = 5, this scale\nheight decreases by a factor of five when going from the inner\nto the outer boundary, which about explains the variation shown\nin Fig. 5.\nThe increase in amplitude can be explained by the variation of the background density: since \u03c1\u0304 decreases by a factor\nof about 150 from ri to ro , a rising (falling) convective plume\ncompensates this with increasing (decreasing) flow amplitude.\nFigure 5 shows an increase of about 60 which seems somewhat\non the low side. However, the radial increase in the number of\nconvective columns and the scale change show that the convective features hardly reach through the whole shell without being\nmodified.\n\n0.65 Ro\n3.2\n2.4\n1.6\n0.8\n0.0\n0.8\n1.6\n2.4\n3.2\n\n0.80 Ro\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0.95 Ro\n200\n\n3.3.2. Zonal flows\nEvonuk (2008) and Glatzmaier et al. (2009) argue that the\ndensity stratification can significantly influence the generation\nof zonal winds. Exploring the possible related effects is the\nmain focus of our study. Figure 6 shows how the zonal flows\nevolve on increasing the Rayleigh number in moderately stratified simulations (N\u03c1 = 3). Close to the onset of convection,\na thin prograde equatorial jet develops in the very outer part\nof the shell. The latitudinal extent of this jet is smaller than\nin Boussinesq convection because the convective columns are\nconfined closer to the outer boundary (see the simulation with\nN\u03c1 = 3 in Fig. 2). It is flanked by weak amplitude retrograde\njets that strongly vary along z. As Ra is increased, convection starts to fill the whole shell, the equatorial jet broadens\nand the zonal winds become more and more geostrophic with\na second retrograde jet that reaches throughout the shell. For\nRa = 5 \u00d7 106 (3.3\u00d7 critical) the equatorial jet has reached a\nmaximum width that it retains at even higher Rayleigh numbers. The retrograde jet broadens toward higher latitudes until\nadditional flanking prograde jets develop below and above the\ninner boundary at large Rayleigh numbers and confine it to mid\nlatitudes. The amplitude of these high-latitude jets becomes\ncomparable to that of the equatorial jet for strongly nonlinear\nsimulations (Ra = 4 \u00d7 107 , 26 \u00d7 Rac ), while the retrograde jet\n\n100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nFigure 5: Radial velocity ur on spherical surfaces at three different radii close\nto the inner boundary (r = 0.65ro ), at the layer middle, and close to the outer\nboundary (r = 0.95ro ).

In this multiple jets regime, retrograde zonal winds are anchored to the tangent cylinder in a similar way to what was already observed in\nBoussinesq simulations (e.g. Christensen, 2001; Heimpel et al.,\n2005).\nThe strong z-dependence at low Rayleigh numbers is a typical thermal wind feature, which can be understood by considering the \u03c6-component of the curl of the momentum equation\n(5):\n\u0012 u \u0013\nD\u03c9\u03c6\n2 \u2202u\u03c6\n\u03c6\n= r sin \u03b8 (\u03c9 * \u2207)\n\u2212 \u03c9\u03c6 \u2207 * u +\nDt\nr sin \u03b8\nE \u2202z\n(23)\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nRa ro2 \u2202s h\n\u22121\n\u2212\n+\n\u2207\n\u00d7\n\u03c1\u0304\n\u2207\n*\nS\n.\n\u03c6\nPr r3 \u2202\u03b8\n\nscale features start to appear for larger stratifications as it has\nalready been reported by Jones and Kuzanyan (2009). They\nare strongly time-dependent and therefore disappear when time\naveraged quantities are considered.\nExcept for these secondary features and the requirement for\nlarger supercriticalities at stronger stratifications, the zonal flow\nstructure is surprisingly independent of the background density\nprofile. We now turn to discussing their amplitude.\n4. Scaling laws\nTo evaluate how the different flow properties depend on the\nbackground density stratification, we consider time averaged\nquantities in the following. Each simulation has been run for\nat least 0.2 viscous diffusions times to get rid of any transients\nand to allow for an averaging period long enough to suppress\nshort term variations. The Reynolds numbers Re and Rossby\nnumbers Ro = E Re, used to quantify the amplitude of different flow contributions are based on the non-dimensional time\naveraged root-mean square velocity:\n\u0010\n\u00111/2\nRe = hu2 i\n,\n(26)\n\nHere D/Dt corresponds to the substantial time derivative and\n\u03c9\u03c6 is the azimuthal vorticity component. For low Rayleigh\nnumbers, inertial contributions can be neglected, and the zdependence of the zonal flows is ruled by the thermal wind balance:\n2 \u2202u\u03c6 Ra ro2 \u2202s\n'\n,\n(24)\nE \u2202z\nPr r3 \u2202\u03b8\nwhere overlines denote an azimuthal average. This allows us to\ndefine the typical lengthscale\n!\n!\u22121\n\u2202 ln u\u03c6 \u22121\nRa E ro2 \u2202s\n.\n(25)\nLz =\n= u\u03c6\n\u2202z\n2Pr r3 \u2202\u03b8\n\nwith\n1 1\nhu i =\n\u03c4 Vs\n\nt0 +\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nZ\nu2 dt dV,\n\nt0\n\n(27)\n\nV\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the averaging interval, V s is the volume of the spherical shell and dV is a volume element. As pointed out by Kaspi\net al. (2009), a comparison of simulations with different density backgrounds may be more relevant if one considers massweighted average quantities. Therefore, the mass-weighted\ncounterparts of Reynolds and Rossby numbers are defined using the time averaged kinetic energy, that is\n\nFor vanishing Ekman numbers, Lz approaches infinity and zonal\nflows become independent of z, recovering Taylor-Proudman\ntheorem and therefore a geostrophic structure. For the lowest Rayleigh number solution shown in Fig. 6a, the thermal\nwinds caused z-variation is still clearly apparent where u\u03c6 is\nweak and Lz therefore small. At larger Rayleigh numbers, the\nthermal wind balance still holds in a statistical sense. According to Eq. (24), \u2202u\u03c6 /\u2202z increases linearly with Ra, while, at\nleast closer to onset, the zonal flow amplitude rises faster. Lz\ntherefore grows with the Rayleigh number and the z-variation\nis gradually lost. In the simulations of Kaspi et al. (2009) however, the zonal winds still vary strongly close to the surface.\nThese are likely promoted by the depth-dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient, which is neglected in our ideal gas\nmodel.\nFigure 7 compares the zonal flows at different density stratifications for simulations with similar hRa\u2217q i\u03c1 and demonstrates\nthat the structure changes very little for N\u03c1 \u2264 3. In the two cases\nat N\u03c1 = 4 and N\u03c1 = 5 the high-latitude jets are still little pronounced and the retrograde jet is also rather weak. According\nto the development shown in Fig. 6 they seem to correspond\nto a lower supercriticality. The fact that N\u03c1 = 4 and 5 simulations have a supercriticality that is about three times higher\nthan that of the N\u03c1 = 2 case, however, implies that significantly\nlarger supercriticalities are required to reach a comparable multiple jet structure when the density stratification is strong. Since\nboth large Rayleigh numbers and strong density stratifications\npromote smaller scales, we could not afford to further increase\nRa for N\u03c1 > 3.

The slope flattens once\nconvection fills the whole shell and seems to reach an asymptotic value for large Rayleigh numbers. The asymptotic slopes\nare larger for the poloidal than for the total flow amplitude.\nIn both Figs. 8 and 9, the curves collapse at larger Rayleigh\nnumbers, and the asymptotic slopes become independent of\nthe density stratification. This is even more convincing when\nmass-weighted average quantities are considered, which basically confirms Kaspi et al. (2009). The remaining differences\n9\n\n\fFigure 8: Time-averaged properties plotted against flux-based Rayleigh number defined in Eq.

Compared to the gas giants, the Rossby\nnumbers where our simulations reach the asymptotic regime are\nroughly one order of magnitude larger. However this is likely a\nconsequence of the moderate Ekman number used in our models as Christensen (2002) showed that this transitional Rossby\nnumber decreases with Ekman number.\nFigure 9c displays the ratio of the total to the non-zonal kinetic energy, while Fig. 8c corresponds to the ratio of square\nvelocities only. For all density stratifications, this ratio initially\nincreases in the weakly supercritical regime but decays once the\nconvection becomes strongly nonlinear. Similarly to what has\nbeen reported for Boussinesq simulations (Christensen, 2002),\nthe maximum is reached close to the transition to the intermittent regime (see Fig. 4 for N\u03c1 \u2264 3).\nIn the nearly Boussinesq simulations, the maximum ratio is\nEkin /Enz ' 20, which means that 95% of the energy are carried\nby zonal flows. For N\u03c1 = 5 this decreases to about 90% at a\nmaximum ratio of Ekin /Enz ' 10. These values are on the low\nside of the expected ratio for Jupiter: around 50 \u2212 100 from\nthe work of Salyk et al. (2006). However, this moderate maximum ratio is once more a consequence of the too large Ekman\nnumber used in our simulations (Christensen, 2002). The slope\nof the decrease for larger Rayleigh numbers also seems to vary\nwith N\u03c1 , but a clear dependence is difficult to extract from our\ndataset. Considering mass-weighted quantities slightly helps to\nmerge the different simulations, but they are far from collapsing\nas nicely as for the Rossby numbers.\nPanels (d) in Figs. 8 and 9 show the dependence of the modified Nusselt number on the Rayleigh numbers. Close to onset of\nconvection, the heat transport is dominated by conduction. The\nclassically defined Nusselt number remains close to unity and\nthe Nusselt number increases only weakly with the Rayleigh\nnumber. When the convective motions become more vigorous, convective heat transport starts to dominate and the Nusselt\nnumber rises steeply. Using the mass-weighted Rayleigh number hRa\u2217q i\u03c1 allows to collapse the curves for different density\nstratifications and a similar asymptotic slope is reached. This\nonce more emphasises that mass-weighted quantities are probably more meaningful parameters, when considering strongly\nnonlinear convection.\nBased on the results displayed in Fig. 9 we have estimated the\nasymptotic dependence of hRoi\u03c1 , hRopol i\u03c1 and Nu\u2217 on hRa\u2217q i\u03c1\nto:\n\u0010\n\u00111/3\nhRoi\u03c1 = 2.45 hRa\u2217q i\u03c1\n,\n(30)\n\nFigure 10: Time average of Reynolds stresses (solid grey line) and viscous force\n(dashed black line) integrated over cylinders (Eq. 34) for a model with N\u03c1 = 3\nand Ra = 2 \u00d7 107 .

This\nis compatible with both laboratory experiments of turbulent\nrotating convection (e.g. Fernando et al., 1991) and previous\nanelastic numerical simulations (Showman et al., 2011) but\nslightly differs from the exponent 2/5 suggested by Christensen\n(2002). Investigating the reason for this difference would probably require more simulations at lower Ekman numbers and lies\nbeyond the scope of this study.\nThe Nusselt number scaling Eq. (32) is in a very good agreement with previous laws derived by Christensen (2002) and\nChristensen and Aubert (2006) for Boussinesq simulations. In\nthe highly supercritical regime, the convective transport dominates diffusion. Then Nu \u223c uconv \u03b4s, or Nu\u2217 \u223c Ropol \u03b4s where\n\u03b4s is a measure for the typical entropy fluctuations. Since Nu\u2217\nand Ropol depend with a very similar exponent on hRa\u2217q i\u03c1 , the\ntypical entropy fluctuations \u03b4s may vary very little with hRa\u2217q i\u03c1\nin the asymptotic regime, in agreement with previous Boussinesq results (Christensen, 2002).\nIn the highly supercritical regime, the majority of the kinetic\nenergy is carried by zonal flows. The asymptotic law for the\ntotal Rossby number (Eq. 30) therefore applies to the amplitude\nof zonal winds. Based on energy considerations for the highly\nsupercritical regime, Showman et al. (2011) derived a scaling\nlaw for strong zonal jets that suggest an exponent of 1/2 rather\nthan the 1/3 promoted here. We further discuss this difference\nin the following section.\n\n\u0010\n\u00110.53\nNu\u2217 = 0.086 hRa\u2217q i\u03c1\n.\n\n(32)\n\n4.1. Force balance and correlation of the convective flow\n\nBlack lines in Fig. 9 show the respective asymptotes. The same\nslopes have been obtained for the usual Rossby and poloidal\nRossby numbers in Fig. 8, as the nearly Boussinesq simulations hardly depend on the density background (therefore massweighted counterparts of Rossby and poloidal Rossby numbers\nare equivalent to their usual definitions).\n\nTo explore how the strong zonal flows are generated and\nmaintained, we analyze the azimuthal component of the NavierStokes equation (5) integrated over cylindrical surfaces of radius s. The Coriolis term is proportional to the net mass flux\nacross these surfaces and therefore vanishes.

In Fig. 11 we show hRezon i\u03c1 versus hRepol i\u03c1 for\nall the simulations of this study, while Fig. 12 shows the dependence of C s\u03c6 on the mass-weighted flux-based Rayleigh number\nfor some snapshots.\nFor lower Rayleigh numbers and thus smaller poloidal\nReynolds numbers hRezon i\u03c1 scales roughly like hRepol i2\u03c1 and C s\u03c6\nis largely independent of the Rayleigh number. Convection assumes the form of regular large scale columns that are tilted in\nprograde direction due to the height change in the container and\nthe background density stratification (e.g. Busse, 1983, 2002).\nThe integrity of the rolls in z-direction and the consistent tilt\nguarantees a good correlation of u s and u\u03c6 and C s\u03c6 is of order\none.\nFor larger Rayleigh numbers the results approach the asymptotic scaling\n\nOn time average the two terms on the right hand side, Reynolds\nstress and viscous stress, should balance. This leads to the following condition\n!\nZ\nZ\n\u2202 u\u03c6\ndz = \u03c1\u0304u s u\u03c6 dz,\n\u03c1\u0304s\n(34)\n\u2202s s\nz\nz\nwhere the overlines indicate an azimuthal average. Figure 10\ncompares the left and right hand side of Eq. (34) for a case with\nN\u03c1 = 3 and Ra = 2\u00d7107 (corresponding to hRa\u2217q i\u03c1 = 1.7\u00d710\u22124 )\nthat lies very close to the asymptotic regimes found in Fig. 9.\nThese two terms balance to a good degree, which proves that\nzonal flows are indeed maintained by Reynolds stresses against\nviscous dissipation.\nAccording to Eq. (10), we can also directly relate the viscous\ncontribution in Fig. 9 to zonal flow gradients. Zonal flows are\nthus expected to increase outside the tangent cylinder, located\nat s = 1.5, and to mainly decrease inside the tangent cylinder.\nA conversion to Reynolds stresses suggests that the strongest\nstresses can be found around the tangent cylinder and close to\nthe outer boundary. The stresses are negative around the tangent\ncylinder and predominantly positive elsewhere. All this corresponds nicely to the multiple jet cases described above with\na prograde equatorial jet, a retrograde jet around the tangent\ncylinder, and a prograde, high latitude jet in each hemisphere.\nSince the typical length scale of the zonal jets remains of order unity, Eq. (10) suggests the scaling (e.g. Christensen, 2002)\nhRezon i\u03c1 \u223c C s\u03c6 hRepol i2\u03c1 ,\n\ni\n\u03c1\u0304u s u\u03c6\n= \"\u0012\n\u00131/2 # .\n2\n2\n\u03c1\u0304u s \u03c1\u0304u\u03c6\n\nhRezon i\u03c1 \u223c hRepol i2/3\n\u03c1 .\n\n(37)\n\nWhen using Eq.

The small scale turbulent motions that develop for\nhighly supercritical convection tend to destroy the correlation\n(Christensen, 2002; Showman et al., 2011). Once more, neither\nthe ratio of hRezon i\u03c1 to hRepol i\u03c1 , nor the dependence of the correlation C s\u03c6 on hRa\u2217q i\u03c1 is significantly affected by the different\ndensity stratifications employed.\nThe loss of correlation explains why the ratio of total to\nnon-zonal kinetic energy shown in Fig. 9c decreases for larger\nRayleigh numbers. Our scaling of C s\u03c6 differs from Showman\n\n(35)\n\nwhere hRezon i\u03c1 is the Reynolds number of axisymmetric zonal\nflows and C s\u03c6 quantifies the correlation of u s and u\u03c6 throughout\nthe shell:\n12\n\n\fet al. (2011), who suggest an exponent of \u22121/2. This also explains the difference in the scaling of the Rossby number mentioned above. This difference may come from specific assumptions used in the model by (Kaspi et al., 2009). While these\nauthors employ a more realistic equation of state, they also\nconsider a simplified expression of the viscosity and neglect\nviscous heating. As Jones and Kuzanyan (2009) have demonstrated, viscous heating can contribute up to 50% to the heat\nbudget, and is therefore likely to influence the average flow\nproperties in the strongly nonlinear regime.\n4.2. Density stratification and vorticity production\nThe z-component of the vorticity equation allows to analyze\nhow the correlation between u s and u\u03c6 comes about. Taking the\nz-component of the curl of the momentum equation (5) leads to\n!\n2 \u2202uz\n2\nD\u03c9z\n\u2212 (\u03c9 * \u2207) uz =\n\u2212\n+ \u03c9z \u2207 * u\nDt\nE \u2202z\nE\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nRa ro2 \u2202s h\n+ \u2207 \u00d7 \u03c1\u0304\u22121 \u2207 * S ,\n\u2212\n3\nz\nPr r \u2202\u03c6\n\n(39)\n\nFigure 13: Time-average of the correlation C s\u03c6 integrated over cylindrical surfaces for simulations with N\u03c1 = 10\u22122 (upper panel): Ra = 3 \u00d7 106 (solid lightgrey line), Ra = 5 \u00d7 106 (dashed grey line), Ra = 8 \u00d7 106 (dotted dark-grey line)\nand Ra = 1.5 \u00d7 107 (dot-dashed black line); and for simulations with N\u03c1 = 5\n(lower panel): Ra = 1 \u00d7 107 (solid light-grey line), Ra = 1.8 \u00d7 107 (dashed grey\nline), Ra = 4 \u00d7 107 (dotted dark-grey line) and Ra = 6 \u00d7 107 (dot-dashed black\nline). The vertical line corresponds to the tangent cylinder.\n\nwhere D/Dt denotes the substantial time derivative and \u03c9z is\nthe vorticity component along the axis of rotation. For small\nEkman numbers, the first two terms on the right hand side dominate. In the Boussinesq approximation, the divergence of u\nvanishes and thus only the first term can contribute. This is\ncalled the vortex stretching term because it describes the vorticity changes in a fluid column experiencing the height gradient\nof the container (e.g. Schaeffer and Cardin, 2005; Glatzmaier\net al., 2009). Because of the curved boundary, the absolute\nvalue of the gradient and thus the stretching effect increases\nwith s, leading to the prograde tilt of the convective columns\n(e.g. Busse, 1983, 2002). At larger Rayleigh numbers, these\ncolumns loose their integrity along z and turbulent effects rather\nthan the boundary curvature start to influence the flow. As reported above, this leads to the decrease in the correlation C s\u03c6 .\nBesides this classical mechanism, compressibility brings a\nnew vorticity source. As explained by Evonuk (2008) and\nGlatzmaier et al. (2009), rising (sinking) plumes generate negative (positive) vorticity due to the compressional source (2E\u22121 +\n\u03c9z )\u2207 * u in Eq. (39). In the 2-D anelastic simulations performed\nby Glatzmaier et al. (2009), the classical vortex stretching term\nis neglected and the new compressional term is the only source\nof vorticity. They report that the direction of the equatorial jet\ndepends on the variations of the density background. According\nto Eq. (4), this new compressional source \u2207*u = \u2212(d ln \u03c1\u0304/dr) ur\nis directly proportional to the density gradient. It is therefore\nexpected to prevail closer to the outer boundary, where this gradient is strong. Moreover, since this mechanism is a local process, it may be less sensitive to the loss of correlation along\na convective column with increasing Rayleigh number (Glatzmaier et al., 2009).\nAt first sight, however, this is hard to reconcile with the fact\nthat the zonal wind structure depends little on the density stratification in our simulations. Figures 11 and 12 have actually\n\ndemonstrated that the decorrelation affects all our cases to a\nsimilar degree, independently of the density background.\nIn order to better understand the decorrelation, Fig. 13 compares the radial correlation profiles for nearly Boussinesq and\nN\u03c1 = 5 cases at various Rayleigh numbers. In the nearly\nBoussinesq cases, the correlation is predominantly lost in the\ninterior but changes very little close to the outer surface, in\nagreement with the results of Christensen (2002). For the\nstrongly stratified cases, the correlation indeed peaks close to\nthe outer boundary as expected from the new compressional\nvorticity source, as long as the Rayleigh number remains moderate. However, on increasing the supercriticality, this particularly strong correlation is lost first and the maximum of C s\u03c6 is\nnow located deeper in the interior.\nThis is also illustrated by Fig. 14a, which shows a meridional cut of azimuthally averaged C s\u03c6 . Figure 14b shows that\nthe decorrelation goes along with a change in the vorticity pattern. In the inner part, the flow still shows a pronounced tilt that\nleads to Reynolds stresses and is clearly dominated by positive\nz-vorticity. Close to the outer boundary, convective motions\nare more radially oriented, without a preferred tilt or a clearly\npreferred sign. We attribute this to an increased mixing efficiency in the very outer part of the flow (Aurnou et al., 2007).\nThe local turnover timescale of convection is a good proxy to\nquantify the mixing efficiency. We estimate this timescale to\nbe \u03c4to \u223c H\u03c1 /uconv . This can be compared with a timescale associated to zonal shear, defined by \u03c4zf \u223c \u03b4/uzonal (where \u03b4 is\nthe typical width of the jets). To yield a significant correlation\nbetween u s and u\u03c6 , the shear timescale needs to be lower than\n13\n\n\fFigure 14: a) Correlation C s\u03c6 in the meridian plane. b) Vorticity along the axis of rotation \u03c9z displayed in the equatorial plane.

The dashed lines in both panels correspond to the radius where the turnover timescale of\nconvection becomes equal to the timescale associated with zonal shear (see Eq. 40).\n\nthe turnover timescale, so that a fluid parcel could be diverted\nin azimuthal direction before loosing its identity, leading to\n\u03c4to > \u03c4zf =\u21d2\n\nH\u03c1\n\u03b4\n>\n.\nuconv uzonal\n\n(40)\n\nFigure 15 shows that this condition is fulfilled in the inner part\nof the layer but fails in a very thin layer close to the surface\n(approximately the outermost 5%). We have marked the radius where both timescales become equal by a dashed circle in\nFig. 14.\nAs demonstrated above for stronger stratifications (see\nFig. 5), H\u03c1 decreases outward while uconv increases. This leads\nto a shorter turnover timescale close to the surface. Therefore,\nsurface plumes that could potentially help to generate vorticity\nvia the compressional source have a too short lifetime to significantly foster Reynolds stresses. In the deeper part, the extra\nefficiency gained by compressible effects is limited, explaining\nwhy zonal jets of compressible and Boussinesq simulations are\nfound to be similar.\nFigure 15: Radial profiles of the two timescales defined in Eq. (40): turnover\ntimescale of convection (dashed black line) and timescale associated with shear\n(solid grey line). These profiles have been derived from an azimuthal average\nof the values in the equatorial plane for a model with N\u03c1 = 5 and Ra = 4 \u00d7 107\n(same model as in Fig. 14).\n\n5. Conclusion\nWe have investigated the effects of compressibility in 3-D\nrapidly rotating convection. Following Gilman and Glatzmaier\n(1981), Jones and Kuzanyan (2009) and Kaspi et al. (2009),\nall the simulations have been computed under the anelastic approximation. As we focus on the effects of the density stratification, we have deliberately chosen a moderate Ekman number\nof 10\u22124 , which allowed us to reach more supercritical Rayleigh\n14\n\n\fnumbers. From the simulations computed in this parametric\nstudy, we highlight the following results:\n\nstudy, for example Ekman number, Prandtl number or aspect ratio, and further simulations would be required to\nclarify this.\n\n\u2022 Concerning the onset of convection, an increase of the\ndensity stratification is accompanied with a strong confinement of the convective columns close to the outer\nboundary as well as an increase of the critical azimuthal\nwavenumber, in agreement with the results of the linear\nstability of Jones et al. (2009). This gradual outward shift\nof the onset of convection is explained by the radial increase of buoyancy.\n\n\u2022 The zonal jets are maintained by Reynolds stresses, which\nrely on the correlation between zonal (u\u03c6 ) and cylindrically radial (u s ) flow components. The gradual loss of\nthis correlation with increasing supercriticality hampers all\nour simulations, independently of the background density\nstratification. However in the strongly stratified simulations, the correlation is first lost in the outer part of the\nflow, where compressibility effects are most significant.\nBecause of the short lengthscales and the large flow amplitudes found there, the fluid parcels loose their identity before interacting efficiently with the zonal flows. This may\nexplain why the additional compressional source of vorticity has not the important effect expected by Evonuk (2008)\nand Glatzmaier et al. (2009) in our simulations. However, the influence of the different vorticity contributions\nare hard to disentangle in 3-D compressible convection,\nstressing the need of future theoretical work to address this\nquestion.\n\n\u2022 When increasing supercriticality, the solutions which simply drift close to onset, start to vacillate, then become\nintermittent and finally chaotic (Grote and Busse, 2001).\nWhile these different regimes are clearly separated in the\nBoussinesq cases, the transitions occupy a shorter fraction\nof the parameter space with increase of density stratification.\n\u2022 For stronger background density stratifications, the convective flow amplitude increases outward, while the\nlengthscale decreases. Concerning zonal winds, Boussinesq and anelastic simulations show very similar properties, provided the convection is strongly driven: both the\nextent and the number of jets become fairly independent\nof the density background. This suggests that zonal flows\nfollow a universal behaviour, independent of the density\nstratification, and may also explain why Boussinesq models were already very successful in reproducing the morphology of the jets observed in gas giants (e.g. Heimpel\net al., 2005).\n\nAll the results obtained in this study have been derived in\na non-conducting layer, where magnetic effects have been neglected. Nevertheless, as suggested by Liu et al. (2008), the\nOhmic dissipation associated with the outer semi-conducting\nregion could strongly limit the extent of the surface jets. Addressing this problem would require 3-D dynamo simulations\nof compressible convection with variable conductivity (Stanley\nand Glatzmaier, 2010; Heimpel and G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez, 2011).\nAcknowledgements\n\n\u2022 In the strongly nonlinear regime, the solutions seem to\nfollow the same asymptotic scaling laws, independently\nof the density stratification. Convective Rossby number\nand Nusselt number follow previously studied laws (Christensen, 2002). The scaling of the total Rossby number\ndiffers slightly from that suggested by Showman et al.\n(2011), which may be attributed to the different model\nused by these authors. The obtained scaling laws allow us to extrapolate our simulations to Jupiter. Taking\nan internal heat flux of 5.44 W.m\u22122 (Hanel et al., 1981),\n\u03a9 = 1.75 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121 , c p = 1.3 \u00d7 104 J.kg\u22121 .K\u22121 and d =\n1.2\u00d7104 kms, the evolution models of Guillot et al. (2004)\nsuggest that the flux-based Rayleigh number decreases\nfrom Ra\u2217q \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 at the surface to Ra\u2217q \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221212\nat the bottom of the molecular envelope (i.e. \u03b7 = 0.85).\nThis leads to a mass-weighted flux based Rayleigh number of hRa\u2217q i\u03c1 \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 . Our scaling law (Eq. 30) then\npredicts a Rossby number of 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 , which corresponds\nto an average zonal velocity around 1 m.s\u22121 . In agreement\nwith the previous extrapolations of Showman et al. (2011),\nthis value is much weaker (about one order of magnitude)\nthan the surface zonal winds of gas giants. This rescaling\nis however tentative as the scaling laws may still depend\non other parameters that have been kept constant in this\n\nAll the computations have been carried out on the GWDG\ncomputer facilities in G\u00f6ttingen.
