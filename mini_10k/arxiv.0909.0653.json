Ressayre\nAbstract. Let G be a complex connected reductive algebraic group and G/B denote the\nflag variety of G. A G-homogeneous space G/H is said to be spherical if H has a finite\nnumber of orbits in G/B. A class of spherical homogeneous spaces containing the tori, the\ncomplete homogeneous spaces and the group G (viewed as a G \u00d7 G-homogeneous space) has\nparticularly nice proterties. Namely, the pair (G, H) is called a spherical pair of minimal\nrank if there exists x in G/B such that the orbit H.x of x by H is open in G/B and the\nstabilizer Hx of x in H contains a maximal torus of H. In this article, we study and classify\nthe spherical pairs of minimal rank.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet G be a complex connected reductive algebraic group. Let B denote the flag variety\nof G. Let H be an algebraic subgroup of G which has a finite number of orbits in B ; the\nsubgroup H and the homogeneous space G/H are said to be spherical.\nIn this article, we study and classify a class of spherical homogeneous spaces containing\nthe tori, the complete homogeneous spaces and the group G viewed as a G \u00d7 G-homogeneous\nspace. Namely, the pair (G, H) is called a spherical pair of minimal rank if there exists x in\nB such that the orbit H.x of x by H is open in B and the stabilizer Hx of x in H contains\na maximal torus of H. In [Kno95] the rank rk(G/H) of the homogeneous space G/H is\ndefined. Moreover, we have rk(G/H) \u2265 rk(G) \u2212 rk(H) (where rk(G) and rk(H) denotes the\nranks of the groups G and H) with equality if and only if (G, H) is of minimal rank. This\nexplains the name. The spherical pairs (G, H) of minimal rank such that H is a symmetric\nsubgroup of G firstly appear in [Bri04]. During the redaction of this article the compactifications of the spherical homogeneous spaces of minimal rank was studied in [Tch05] and [BJ06].\nLet us state our main result. Propositions 3.1, 3.2 and 4.2 reduce the classification to\nthe special case when G is semi-simple adjoint and H is simple. Indeed, any spherical pair\nof minimal rank is obtained from special ones and toric ones by products, finite covers and\nparabolic inductions. Next, we prove\nTheorem A The spherical pairs (G, H) of minimal rank with G semi-simple adjoint and\nH simple are:\n(i) G = H.\n(ii) H is simple and diagonally embedded in G = H \u00d7 H.\n(iii) (PSL2n , PSp2n ) with n \u2265 2.\n(iv) (PSO2n , SO2n\u22121 ) with n \u2265 4.\n1\n\n\f(v) (SO7 , G2 ).\n(vi) (E6 , F4 ).\nWe denote by H(B) the set of the H-orbit closures in B. If H = P is a Borel subgroup of\nG, the elements of H(B) are the famous Schubert varieties. Most of combinatorial and geometric properties of the Schubert varieties cannot be generalized to the elements of H(G/B)\nif H is only spherical. However, if H is of minimal rank the elements of H(G/B) have nice\nproperties. Let us give details.\nThe Weyl group W of G acts transitively on the set of Schubert varieties; this action\nparametrizes these varieties by W/WP . In general, F. Knop has defined in [Kno95] an action\nof W in H(B); but, it seems to be difficult to deduce a parametrization of H(B) from this\naction. We show in Proposition 2.1 that G/H is of minimal rank if and only if the action of\nW is transitive on H(B). In this case, the isotropy groups are isomorphic to the Weyl group\nWH of H; and, W/WH parametrizes H(B).\nThe Schubert varieties are normal; but, in general elements of H(B) are not normal\n(see [Bri01] or [Pin01] for examples). By a result of Brion, if G/H is of minimal rank, the\nelements of H(B) are normal.\nIn [Kno95], F. Knop also defined an action of a monoid W\u0303 (constructed from the generators of W ) on H(B). Moreover, the inclusion defines an order on H(B) which generalizes\nthe Bruhat order for the Schubert varieties. The description of the Bruhat order from the\naction of W\u0303 is well known as the cancellation lemma. In general, no such description of this\norder is known. Corollary 2.1 is a cancellation lemma in the minimal rank case.\nThe number of Schubert varieties of dimension d equal those of the codimension d. In\nProposition 2.3 we show such a symmetry property of H(B) for any spherical pair (G, H) of\nminimal rank.\nLet us explain another important motivation for this work. Let T be a maximal torus of\nG and X be a G-equivariant embedding of a spherical homogeneous space G/H of minimal\nrank. In Proposition 2.4, we show that for all fixed point x of T in X, G.x is complete. This\nproperty seems to play a key role in several works about the embeddings of G \u00d7 G/G (see\nfor example, [Tch02]).\nIn Section 2, we study the properties of H(B) and of the toroidal embeddings of G/H for\nthe spherical pairs (G, H) of minimal rank. This allows us to give several characterizations\nof the minimal rank property. In Section 3, we reduce the classification to the case when\nG and H are semisimple. In Section 4, we classify such pairs by associating to (G, H) an\ninvolution on the vertices of the Dynkin diagram of G.\n\n2\n\nEquivalent definitions and first properties\n\n2.1\n\nMinimal rank and orbits of H in B\n\n2.1.1 - Let us fix some general notation. If X is a variety, dim(X) denotes the dimension\n2\n\n\fof X. It x belongs to X, Tx X denotes the Zariski-tangent space of X at x. If \u0393 is an algebraic\ngroup a \u0393-variety X is a variety endowed with an algebraic action of \u0393. Let \u0393 be an affine\nalgebraic group and X be a \u0393-variety. For x a point in X, we denote by \u0393x the isotropy\ngroup of x and by \u0393.x its orbit. We denote by X \u0393 the set of fixed point of \u0393 in X. We\ndenote by \u0393u the unipotent radical of \u0393.\n2.1.2 - Let us recall that G is a connected complex reductive group, B its flag variety,\nH a spherical subgroup of G and H(B) the set of the H-orbit closures in B. If V belongs to\nH(B), we denote by V \u25e6 the unique open H-orbit in V .\nWe recall the definition of [Res04] of a graph \u0393(G/H) whose vertices are the elements of\nH(B). The original construction of \u0393(G/H) due to M. Brion is equivalent but very slightly\ndifferent (see [Bri01]).\nConsider the set \u2206 of conjugacy classes of minimal non solvable parabolic subgroups of\nG. If \u03b1 belongs to \u2206, we denote by P\u03b1 the G-homogeneous space with isotropy \u03b1. Then,\nthere exists a unique G-equivariant map \u03c6\u03b1 : B \u2212\u2192 P\u03b1 which is a P1 -bundle.\nLet V \u2208 H(B) and \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206. We assume that the restriction of \u03c6\u03b1 to V \u25e6 is finite and we\n\u2032\ndenote its degree by d(V, \u03b1). Then, \u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 (\u03c6\u03b1 (V )) is an element denoted V of H(B); in this\ncase, we say that \u03b1 raises V to V \u2032 . One of the three following cases occurs.\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u2032\u25e6\n\u2022 Type U: H has two orbits in \u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 (\u03c6\u03b1 (V )) (V and V ) and d(V, \u03b1) = 1.\n\u25e6\n\u2022 Type T : H has three orbits in \u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 (\u03c6\u03b1 (V )) and d(V, \u03b1) = 1.\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u2032\u25e6\n\u2022 Type N: H has two orbits in \u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 (\u03c6\u03b1 (V )) (V and V ) and d(V, \u03b1) = 2.\n\nDefinition. Let \u0393(G/H) be the oriented graph with vertices the elements of H(B) and\nedges labeled by \u2206, where V is joined to V \u2032 by an edge labeled by \u03b1 if \u03b1 raises V to V \u2032 .\nThis edge is simple (resp. double) if d(V, \u03b1) = 1 (resp. 2). Following the above cases, we\nsay that an edge has type U, T or N.\n2.1.3 - Let us fix a Borel subgroup B of G. Let Y be a B-variety. The character group\nX (Y ) of Y is the set of all characters of B that arise as weights of eigenvectors of B in the\nfunction field K(Y ). Then X (Y ) is a free abelian group of finite rank rk(Y ), the rank of Y\n(see [Kno95]). It is well known that a B-orbit O is isomorphic as a variety to Kl \u00d7 (K\u2217 )r\nwhere r = rk(O) and l = dim(O) \u2212 rk(O).\nIf V belongs to H(B), we set:\nVH = {gH/H : g \u22121 B/B \u2208 V }.\nThen, VH is a B-orbit closure in G/H. Moreover, the map V 7\u2212\u2192 VH is a bijection from\nH(B) onto the set of the B-orbit closures in G/H. The rank of VH is also denoted by rk(V )\nand called the rank of V.\n2.1.4 - Let T be a maximal torus of B. Let W denote the Weyl group of T . Every\n\u03b1 in \u2206 has a unique representative P\u03b1 which contains B. Moreover, there exists a unique\ns\u03b1 in W such that Bs\u03b1 B is dense in P\u03b1 ; and this s\u03b1 is a simple reflexion of W . The map,\n\u2206 \u2212\u2192 W, \u03b1 7\u2212\u2192 s\u03b1 is a bijection from \u2206 onto the set of simple reflexions of W .\n3\n\n\fF. Knop defined in [Kno95] an action of W on the set H(B) by describing the action of\nthe s\u03b1 , for any \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206:\n\u2022 Type U: s\u03b1 exchanges the two vertices of an edge of type U labeled by \u03b1.\n\u2022 Type T : If \u03b1 raises V1 and V2 to V , then s\u03b1 V1 = V2 and s\u03b1 V = V .\n\u2022 Type N: s\u03b1 fixes the two vertices of a double edge labeled by \u03b1.\n\u2022 s\u03b1 fixes all others vertices of \u0393(G/H).\n2.1.5 - We can now characterize the spherical pairs of minimal rank in terms of H(B):\nProposition 2.1 With above notation, the following are equivalent:\n(i) There exists x \u2208 B such that H.x is open in B and Hx contains a maximal torus of H.\n(ii) rk(G) \u2212 rk(H) = rk(G/H).\n(iii) All the elements of H(B) have same rank.\n(iv) All the edges in \u0393(G/H) have type U.\n(v) W acts transitively on \u0393(G/H).\nIf (G, H) satisfies these properties, we say that (G, H) is of minimal rank.\nProof. The equivalence between the two first assertions follows from [Res05, Corollary 3.1].\nLet us recall some properties of the graph \u0393(G/H) from [Bri01]. If \u03b1 raises V to V \u2032 by\nan edge of type U (resp. T or N) then rk(V \u2032 ) = rk(V ) (resp. rk(V \u2032 ) = rk(V ) + 1). Moreover,\nall V in H(B) is joined to B by an increasing path in \u0393(G/H) (property of connectedness).\nFinally, the rank of a closed H-orbit in B equals rk(G) \u2212 rk(H).\nNow, one easily checks the equivalence between Assertions (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).\n\u0003\n2.1.6 - Let (G, H) be a spherical pair of minimal rank. Then, the elements of H(B) can\nbe parametrized. Indeed, let W0 be the stabilizer of B for the action of W . In [Res05], it is\nshown that W0 is isomorphic to the Weyl group WH of H. Moreover, Proposition 2.1 shows\nthat the Knop's action gives a bijection between W/W0 and H(B). In particular, we have:\n|W |\n|H(B)| = |W\n, where |E| denotes the cardinality of the finite set E.\nH|\nEach orbit closure V of H in B is multiplicity-free in the sense of [Bri01]. In particular,\nby [Bri01, Theorem 5] V is normal.\n2.1.7 - In this paragraph, we are interested in reading the generalized Bruhat order off\nthe graph \u0393(G/H). Let us start by showing the following nice property of this graph:\nProposition 2.2 There exists a unique closed orbit of H in B and it is the only minimal\nelement of \u0393(G/H).\n4\n\n\fProof. Let V0 be a closed orbit of H in B. Let H0 be the set of the H-orbit closures in B\nlinked with V0 by an oriented path in \u0393(G/H). It is sufficient to prove that H0 = H(B).\nWe assume that H(B) \u2212 H0 is not empty. Since B belongs to H0 and all the orbits are\njoined to B by an oriented path, there exists Z \u2208 H(B) \u2212 H0 and \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 such that \u03b1 raises\nZ to an element Z \u2032 of H0 (it is sufficient to take Z of maximal dimension in H(B) \u2212 H0 ).\nLet us fix such a pair (Z, \u03b1) such that Z is of minimal dimension.\nSince Z \u2032 6= V0 , there exists \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 and Y \u2208 H0 such that \u03b2 raises Y to Z \u2032 . Since the\nedges of \u0393(G/H) are of type U and Y 6= Z, we have \u03b2 6= \u03b1.\nUsing [Bri01, Lemma 3], one easily checks that one of the two following graphs is a\nsubgraph of \u0393(G/H):\n\nZ\u2032\nZ\n\u03b2\n\nY\n\n\u03b1\n\nV\u2032\n\n\u03b2\n\nV\n\n\u03b1\n\nV\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nY\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nZ\u2032\n\nV \u2032\u2032\nIn the first case, Z, V \u2032 and V \u2032\u2032 does not belong to H0 . By minimality of the dimension of\nZ and by considering (V \u2032\u2032 , \u03b2) we deduce that V does not belong to H0 . Now, the pair (V, \u03b1)\ncontradicts the minimality of the dimension of Z. A similar argue works in the second case. \u0003\nLet V in H(B) and V0 denote the unique closed H-orbit B. By Proposition 2.2, there\nexists an increasing path in \u0393(G/H) from V0 to V . Let (\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1s ) be the sequence of the\nlabels of the edges of such a path. Notice that s = dim(V ) \u2212 dim(V0 ). The inclusion relation\nH(B) can be read off the graph \u0393(G/H) by the following cancellation corollary:\nCorollary 2.1 We use above notation and fix V \u2032 in H(B). Set k = dim(V \u2032 ) \u2212 dim(V0 ).\nThen, V \u2032 \u2282 V if and only if there exists i1 < * * * < ik such that the increasing path starting\nfrom V0 and with labels (\u03b1i1 , * * * , \u03b1ik ) ends at V \u2032 .\nProof. Using Proposition 2.2, the proof of [RS90] works here.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.1.8 - Let dG (resp. dH ) denote the dimension of the complete flag variety of G (resp.\nH). Then, we have the following \"symmetry\" on the set H(B):\nProposition 2.3 Here we assume that H is connected. For all 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 dG \u2212dH , the number\nof elements in H(B) of dimension dG \u2212 \u03b4 equal those of dimension dH + \u03b4.\nProof. Consider PG (t) and PH (t) the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of the complete flag varieties\nof G and H. By Poincar\u00e9 duality, they are symmetric polynomials of degrees dG and dH ;\nthat is, tdG PG (1/t) = PG (t) and tdH PH (1/t) = PH (t).\n5\n\n\fConsider the following polynomial:\nQ(t) =\n\nX\n\ntdim(V )\u2212dH .\n\nV \u2208H(B)\n\nWe claim that Q(t).PH (t) = PG (t). The claim implies that Q(t) is symmetric and so the\nproposition.\nLet BH denote the flag variety of H. For any x \u2208 B, Hx is a solvable subgroup of H\ncontaining a maximal torus of H. It follows that Hx is contained in a Borel subgroup of H:\nconsider \u03c6x : H.x \u2212\u2192 BH the map induced by this inclusion. Moreover, the fiber \u03c6\u22121\nx (\u03c6x (x))\nis isomorphic to an affine space of dimension dim(H.x) \u2212 dH .\nWe choose one point in each orbit of H in B and consider the associated morphisms \u03c6x .\nThere exists a finitely generated extension K of Q such that G, H, the inclusion of H in\nG, the chosen points in B, the morphisms \u03c6x , the isomorphisms between the fibers the \u03c6x\nand affine spaces are all defined. By taking an extension if necessary, we may (and shall)\nalso assume that the Schubert cells (for fixed Borel subgroups of G and H) of B and BH are\ndefined and isomorphic to affine spaces over K.\nNow, we consider a finite quotient Fq of K and the points B(Fqn ) of B over Fqn for all\npositive integer n. By using the decompositions of B and BH in Schubert cells, one obtain:\n|B(Fqn )| = PG (q n ) and |BH (Fqn )| = PH (q n ).\nNow, we count the points in B(Fqn ) by using the decomposition in H-orbits:\nX\nX\n|BH (Fqn )|.(q n )dim(V )\u2212dH = PH (q n ).Q(q n ).\n|V \u25e6 (Fqn )| =\n|B(Fqn )| =\nV \u2208H(B)\n\nV \u2208H(B)\n\nThe claim follows.\n\n2.2\n\n\u0003\n\nMinimal rank and toroidal embeddings\n\n2.2.1 - In this subsection, (G, H) is a spherical pair not necessarily of minimal rank.\nAn embedding of G/H is a pair (X, x) where X is a normal and irreducible G-variety and x\nis a point of X such that G.x is open in X and Gx = H. Such an embedding is said to be\ntoroidal if any irreducible B-stable divisor of X which contains a G-orbit is G-stable.\nLemma 2.1 Let G/H be a spherical homogeneous space (not necessarily of minimal rank).\nLet (X, x) be a toroidal embedding of G/H and y be a point in X.\nThen, we have the inequality:\nrk(G/H) + rk(H) \u2265 rk(G.y) + rk(Gy ).\nIn particular, if G/H is of minimal rank, G.y is.\n\n6\n\n\fProof. Firstly, we prove that it is sufficient to show the lemma when dim(G.y) = dim(X)\u2212\n1. By [BL87, Lemma 2.1.1], since X is toroidal, there exists G-orbits O0 , * * * , Os such\nthat G.y = O0 \u2282 O1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Os = X (where Oi denotes the closure of Oi in X) and\ndim(Oi+1 ) = dim(Oi ) + 1 for all i = 0, * * * , s \u2212 1. For all i we fix a point yi in Oi . Since Oi\nis normal, we can apply the case when dim(G.y) = dim(X) \u2212 1 to each Oi \u2282 Oi+1 showing\nthat:\nrk(G.yi+1 ) + rk(Gyi+1 ) \u2265 rk(G.yi ) + rk(Gyi ).\nThe inequality of the lemma follows.\nWe now assume that dim(G.y) = dim(X) \u2212 1. Set O = G.y. Consider the linear action\nof the group Gy acts on quotient Ty X/Ty O of Ty X by Ty O. Since X is normal, it is smooth\nat y and Ty X/Ty O is a line. So, the action of Gy defines a character \u03c7 : Gy \u2212\u2192 K\u2217 .\nLet Ty be a maximal torus of Gy . Let S denote the neutral component of the kernel of\nthe restriction of \u03c7 to Ty . We claim that S has fixed points in G.x. Set \u03a9 = G.x \u222a O; it\nis open in X and hence it is a smooth variety. By a result of Bialynicki-Birula, we have\nTx (\u03a9S ) = (Tx \u03a9)S . In particular, \u03a9S is not contained in O. This proves the claim.\nBy the claim, a subgroup conjugated to S fixes x and:\nrk(H) \u2265 dim(S) = dim(Ty ) \u2212 1 = rk(Gy ) \u2212 1.\nMoreover, since X is toroidal rk(G/H) = rk(O) + 1. The lemma follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.2.2 - The fixed points of a maximal torus of G in the toroidal embeddings of spherical\nhomogeneous spaces of minimal rank are easy to localize. Indeed, we have:\nProposition 2.4 Let (G, H) be a spherical pair and T be a maximal torus of G. The\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) (G, H) is of minimal rank.\n(ii) There exists a complete toroidal embedding (X, x) of G/H such that for all x \u2208 X T\nG.x is complete.\n(iii) For all complete toroidal embedding (X, x) of G/H and for all x \u2208 X T , G.x is complete.\nProof. We assume that (G, H) is of minimal rank and fix a complete toroidal embedding\n(X, x) of G/H. Let y \u2208 X T . Lemma 2.1 shows that rk(G.y) = 0; that is G.y is complete.\nThis proves that Assertion (i) implies Assertion (iii).\nConversely, let (X, x) satisfying Assertion (ii). It remains to prove that (G, H) is of\nminimal rank.\nLet \u03bb be a one-parameter subgroup of T such that T is the centralizer of the image of\n\u03bb (that is, \u03bb is regular) and X \u03bb = X T (where X \u03bb denote the set of fix points of the image\nof \u03bb). Since \u03bb is regular, the set g \u2208 G such that limt\u21920 \u03bb(t)g\u03bb(t\u22121 ) exists in G is a Borel\nsubgroup of G denoted by B(\u03bb). By Proposition 2.1, it is sufficient to prove that for all\n7\n\n\fy \u2208 G.x we have rk(B(\u03bb).y) = rk(G/H). This holds by Lemma 2.2 below since the rank of\na complete G-orbit equals zero.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.2 Let (X, x) be a complete toroidal embedding of the spherical homogeneous space\nG/H. Let y be a point in the open G-orbit in X Let \u03bb be a regular one-parameter subgroup\nof T such that X \u03bb = X T . Set z = limt\u21920 \u03bb(t)y.\nThen, we have:\nrk(G/H) \u2212 rk(B(\u03bb).y) = rk(G.z).\nProof. Let us introduce some material and notation from [BL87]. There exists a parabolic\nsubgroup P of G containing T such that Pz is reductive. Let Q denote the parabolic subgroup\nof G containing T and opposite to P . We have Guz \u2282 Qu and there exists a closed subvariety\nA \u2282 Qu Pz -stable such that the product in G induces an isomorphism A \u00d7 Quz \u2212\u2192 Qu . By\n[BL87, Lemma 1.1], there exists a locally closed affine normal and irreducible subvariety S\nof X such that S \u2229 G.z = {z}, S is Pz -stable and the morphism G \u00d7 S \u2212\u2192 X induced by\nthe action is smooth at (1, z). In particular, we have:\ndim(S) = dim(G/H) \u2212 dim(G.z) = rk(G/H) \u2212 rk(G.z).\n\n(1)\n\nLet P \u00d7Pz (A\u00d7S) denote the quotient of P \u00d7A\u00d7S by the action of Pz defined by p.(q, a, s) =\n(qp\u22121 , pap\u22121 , ps), where p \u2208 Pz , (q, a, s) \u2208 P \u00d7 A \u00d7 S. The group P acts naturally on this\nvariety. By [BL87, Theorem 5], the morphism\n\u0398 : P \u00d7Pz (A \u00d7 S) \u2212\u2192 X\n(p : (a, s))\n7\u2212\u2192 (pa).s\nis an open immersion.\nConsider the Bialynicki-Birula cell\nX(\u03bb, z) = {p \u2208 X : lim \u03bb(t)p = z}.\nt\u21920\n\nNotice that y \u2208 X(\u03bb, z). By [BL87, Propositions 2.1 and 2.3], X(\u03bb, z) \u2229 G.x = B(\u03bb).y and\nG.x \u2229 S = T.y \u2032 for some y \u2032 \u2208 B(\u03bb).y. Then, the proof of [BL87, Proposition 2.3] shows that\n\u0398 induces by restriction an isomorphism:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP \u2229 B(\u03bb) \u00d7B(\u03bb)z (A \u2229 B(\u03bb)) \u00d7 T.y \u2032 \u2212\u2192 B(\u03bb).y.\nSince T is contained in B(\u03bb)z , this isomorphism implies that\nrk(B(\u03bb).y) = dim(T.y \u2032) = dimS.\nThe lemma follows from Equalities 1 and 2.\n\n(2)\n\u0003\n\n8\n\n\f3\n\nReduction to the case when G and H are semi-simple\n\nThe goal of this section is to reduce the classification of the spherical pairs (G, H) to\nthose with G semi-simple adjoint and H semi-simple.\nProposition 3.1 Let (G, H) be a spherical pair of minimal rank.\nThen, there exists a parabolic subgroup P of G with a Levi decomposition P = P u L and\na reductive subgroup K of L such that:\n(i) H = P u K\n(ii) (L, K) is a spherical pair of minimal rank.\nProof. We can write H = H u K, where K is a reductive subgroup of H. But, by\n[Humphreys, 30.3], there exists a parabolic subgroup P = P u L of G such that H u \u2286 P u and\nK \u2286 L. We claim that P and L satisfy the proposition.\nLet firstly prove that P u = H u .\nLet T (H) be a maximal torus of K (and hence of H). The variety B contains on open\nsubset stable by P (and hence by H) isomorphic to P u \u00d7 B(L) (with obvious notation). By\nassumption, there exists a point x in B fixed by T (H) such that H.x is open in B. But,\nx = (u, y) belongs to P u \u00d7 B(L). Since the H-orbit of x is open in P u \u00d7 B(L), so is its\nintersection with P u \u00d7 {y}. Hence, the set of the hkuk \u22121 \u2208 P u such that h \u2208 H u and k \u2208 Ky\nis open and dense in P u . In particular, the Ky -orbit Ky .(uH u ) is open and dense in P u /H u .\nSince x \u2208 BT (H) , uH u \u2208 (P u /H u )T (H) . But, Ky is a solvable group with T (H) as maximal\ntorus. So, Ky\u25e6 .uH u is one orbit of the unipotent radical Kyu of Ky\u25e6 . In particular, it is closed\nin the affine variety P u /H u . But it is also open. We deduce that Ky acts transitively on\nP u /H u .\nBut Kyu is contained is K and normalizes H u . So, H u is a fix point of Ky in P u /H u . We\ndeduce that P u /H u has only one point ; that is, that P u = H u .\nOn the other hand, K.y is open in B(L) and y is fixed by the maximal torus T (H) of K.\nWe deduce that (L, K) is a spherical pair of minimal rank.\n\u0003\nSince the parabolic subgroups of a given reductive group are very well known, Proposition 3.1 reduces the problem of classification of the spherical pairs (G, H) of minimal rank\nto the case when H is reductive.\nProposition 3.2 Let G be a connected reductive group. Set Gad = G/Z(G) and consider\nthe projection p : G \u2212\u2192 Gad . Let H be a reductive subgroup of G. Then,\n(i) The pair (G, H) is spherical of minimal rank if and only if the pair (Gad , p(H)) is.\n(ii) The pair (G, H) is spherical of minimal rank if and only if the pair (G, H \u25e6 ) is.\n9\n\n\f(iii) If G/H is of minimal rank, the neutral component p(H)\u25e6 of p(H) is semi-simple.\nProof. Assertions (i) and (ii) are obvious from Assertion (i) of Proposition 2.1.\nTo prove the last assertion, it is sufficient to prove that the connected center S of H is\ncontained in the center of G. There exists x \u2208 B fixed by S such that H.x is open in B.\nSince, H \u2282 GS , GS .x is open in B. But, GS .x is an irreducible component of BS . Therefore,\nBS = B and S is central in G.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.2 reduces the problem of classification of the spherical pairs (G, H) of\nminimal rank to the case when G is semi-simple adjoint and H is semi-simple. From now\non, we only consider such pairs.\n\n4\n\nClassification of Lie algebras\n\nLet (G, H) be a spherical pair of minimal rank with G semi-simple adjoint and H semisimple. Let g (resp. h) denote the Lie algebra of G (resp. H).\n\n4.1\n\nRoot systems of g and h\n\nLet T (H) be a maximal torus of H. Let T \u2283 T (H) be a maximal torus of G. Let\nX (T ) = Hom(T, K\u2217 ) (resp. X (T (H)) = Hom(T (H), K\u2217 )) denote the character group of T\n(resp. T (H)). Let \u03c6g \u2282 X (T ) (resp. \u03c6h \u2282 X (T (H))) be the set of roots of g (resp. h). Let\n\u03c1 : X (T ) \u2212\u2192 X (T (H)) be the restriction map.\nIn this subsection, we will prove some very constraining relations between \u03c6g, \u03c6h and \u03c1.\n4.1.1\nThe following stability of the set spherical pairs of minimal rank will be used to localize\nthe study over some fixed roots of h:\nLemma 4.1 Let S be a subtorus of H.\nThen, (GS , H S ) is a spherical pair of minimal rank.\nProof. Let T (H) be a maximal torus of H which contains S. Let x be a fixed point of\nT (H) in B such that H.x is open in B. Since V \u2229 GS .x is open in GS .x, it is irreducible.\nSo, it is an irreducible component of V S . Now, [Ric82] implies that V \u2229 GS .x = H S .x. In\nparticular, H S .x is open in GS .x \u2243 B(GS ) and x is fixed by the maximal torus T (H) of H S .\nThe lemma follows.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.2 With the above notation, we have \u03c1(\u03c6g) = \u03c6h.\n\n10\n\n\fProof. Let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6g. Set S = Ker(\u03c1(\u03b1))\u25e6 \u2282 T (H). By Lemma 4.1, H S is a spherical\nsubgroup of GS and rk(GS /H S ) = rk(GS ) \u2212 rk(H S ). Since the semi-simple rank of GS is\n\u25e6\none, this implies that H S is not a torus. So, \u03c1(\u03b1) is a root of h.\nMoreover, since h \u2282 g, \u03c6h \u2282 \u03c1(\u03c6g).\n\u0003\nBy Lemma 4.2, we can define the map \u03c1\u03c6 : \u03c6g \u2212\u2192 \u03c6h, \u03b1 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c1(\u03b1).\nLemma 4.3 The spherical pairs (G, H) of minimal rank with G semi-simple adjoint, H\nconnected and h = sl2 are:\n(i) (PSL2 , PSL2 ).\n(ii) PSL2 diagonally embedded in PSL2 \u00d7 PSL2 .\nProof. By Assertion (i) of Proposition 2.1, the dimension of B is at most 2. We deduce\nthat G = PSL2 or PSL2 \u00d7 PSL2 . The lemma follows easily.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.4 Let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6h.\nThen, \u03c1\u03c6\u22121 (\u03b1) contains either one root of g or two orthogonal roots of g. Moreover, if\n\u22121\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u25e6\n\u03c1\u22121\n\u03c6 (\u03b1) = {\u03b1 } then h\u03b1 = g\u03b1\u25e6 ; and if \u03c1\u03c6 (\u03b1) = {\u03b1 , \u03b1 } with \u03b1 6= \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6g then h\u03b1 6= g\u03b1\u00b1 .\nProof. Set S = ker(\u03b1)\u25e6 . Since hS \u2243 sl2 and by Lemma 4.1, we can apply Lemma 4.3 to\n(GS /S, H S /S). The lemma follows immediately.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.4 divides the set of roots of h in two kinds:\n\u03c61h := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6h : |\u03c1\u22121\n\u03c6 (\u03b1)| = 1}\n\nand\n\n\u03c62h := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6h : |\u03c1\u22121\n\u03c6 (\u03b1)| = 2}.\n\nWe denote by WH the Weyl group NH (T (H))/T (H) of H.\nLemma 4.5 The sets \u03c61h and \u03c62h are stable by the action of WH .\nProof. By Lemma 4.1, (GT (H) , T (H)) is a spherical pair of minimal rank. So, GT (H) is a\ntorus and GT (H) = T . In particular, NH (T (H)) is contained in NG (T ); this inclusion induces\nan injection of WH = NH (T (H))/T (H) into W = NG (T )/T . By this injection, we obtain an\naction of WH on X (T ) such that \u03c1 is WH -equivariant. The lemma follows.\n\u0003\n4.1.2\n\nSimple roots\n\nIn Section 4.1.1, we just proved that \u03c1 induces a map from \u03c6h onto \u03c6h. In this section,\nwe will prove that \u03c1 induces a map from the Dynkin diagram of g onto those of h.\n\u22121\n+\n+\nLet us fix a choice \u03c6+\nh of positive roots for h. Set \u03c6g = \u03c1\u03c6 (\u03c6h ). Let \u2206g (resp. \u2206h) be\nthe set of simple roots of \u03c6g (resp. \u03c6h).\n11\n\n\fLemma 4.6 Let \u03b1 be a root of g. Then, \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206g if and only if \u03c1\u03c6 (\u03b1) \u2208 \u2206h.\n+\n+\nProof. Since \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6+\ng if and only if \u03c1(\u03b1) \u2208 \u03c6h , we may assume that \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c6g .\n\nLet us assume that \u03b1 6\u2208 \u2206g. Then, there exists \u03b2 and \u03b3 in \u03c6+\ng such that \u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b3. By\napplying \u03c1, we see that \u03c1(\u03b1) does not lie in \u2206h.\nLet us assume that \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206g. By absurd, we assume that there exists \u03b2 and \u03b3 in \u03c6+\nh such\nthat \u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03b2 + \u03b3. Three cases occurs:\nCase 1: \u03b2 and \u03b3 belong to \u03c61h.\nLet \u03b2 \u25e6 and \u03b3 \u25e6 be in \u03c6g such that \u03c1(\u03b2 \u25e6 ) = \u03b2 and \u03c1(\u03b3 \u25e6 ) = \u03b3. By Lemma 4.3, g\u03b2 \u25e6 = h\u03b2 and\ng\u03b3 \u25e6 = h\u03b3 . So, we have:\n[g\u03b2 \u25e6 , g\u03b3 \u25e6 ] = [h\u03b2 , h\u03b3 ] = h\u03c1(\u03b1) .\nIn particular this bracket is non zero and \u03b2 \u25e6 + \u03b3 \u25e6 is a root of g. Moreover, g\u03b2 \u25e6 +\u03b3 \u25e6 = h\u03c1(\u03b1) . So,\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nLemma 4.3 shows that \u03c1(\u03b1) \u2208 \u03c61h. But \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u25e6 + \u03b3 \u25e6 belong to \u03c1\u22121\n\u03c6 (\u03c1(\u03b1)). So, \u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b3 ;\nand this root is not simple.\nCase 2: \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c61h and \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c62h.\n+\n\u2212\nLet \u03b2 \u25e6 as above. We can write \u03c1\u22121\n\u03c6 (\u03b3) = {\u03b3 , \u03b3 }. We have:\ng\u03b2 \u25e6 +\u03b3 + + g\u03b2 \u25e6 +\u03b3 \u2212 \u2283 [g\u03b2 \u25e6 , g\u03b3 + + g\u03b3 \u2212 ] \u2283 [g\u03b2 \u25e6 , h\u03b3 ] = [h\u03b2 , h\u03b3 ] = h\u03b2+\u03b3 = h\u03c1(\u03b1) .\nMoreover, since h\u03b3 is different from g\u03b3 + and g\u03b3 \u2212 , h\u03c1(\u03b1) is different from g\u03b2 \u25e6 +\u03b3 + and g\u03b2 \u25e6 +\u03b3 \u2212 .\n\u25e6\n+\n\u25e6\n\u2212\nIn particular, \u03b2 \u25e6 + \u03b3 + and \u03b2 \u25e6 + \u03b3 \u2212 are roots of g; and \u03c1\u22121\n\u03c6 (\u03c1(\u03b1)) = {\u03b2 + \u03b3 , \u03b2 + \u03b3 }. So,\n\u25e6\n+\n\u25e6\n\u2212\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b3 or \u03b2 + \u03b3 ; and this root is not simple.\nCase 3: \u03b2 and \u03b3 belong to \u03c62h.\nWith obvious notation, we have:\ng\u03b2 + +\u03b3 + + g\u03b2 + +\u03b3 \u2212 + g\u03b2 \u2212 +\u03b3 + + g\u03b2 \u2212 +\u03b3 \u2212 \u2283 [h\u03b2 , h\u03b3 ] = h\u03b2+\u03b3 .\nIf h\u03b2+\u03b3 equals one of the four spaces g\u03b2 \u00b1 +\u03b3 \u00b1 , Lemma 4.4 shows that \u03b1 equals \u03b2 \u00b1 + \u03b3 \u00b1\nand is not a simple root. Else, two of the four spaces g\u03b2 \u00b1 +\u03b3 \u00b1 are not zero and \u03b1 equals one\nof the two corresponding roots; in particular \u03b1 is not simple.\n\u0003\nConsider the map\n\u03c1\u2206 : \u2206g \u2212\u2192\n\u2206h\n\u03b1 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c1\u03c6 (\u03b1).\nSet \u22062h = \u2206h \u2229 \u03c62h and \u22061h = \u2206h \u2229 \u03c61h.\nOn the Dynkin diagram of h, we color in black the simple roots in \u22062 h. The so obtained\ndiagram is called the colored Dynkin diagram of h and is denoted by Dh. From now on,\nwhen we draw the Dynkin diagram Dg of g, two simple roots \u03b1 and \u03b2 are placed on the\nsame vertical line if and only if \u03c1\u2206 (\u03b1) = \u03c1\u2206 (\u03b2); in such a way, \u03c1\u2206 identifies with the vertical\nprojection. Note that by Lemma 4.4, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are orthogonal. For (PSL4 , PSp4 ), we obtain\nthe following picture:\n12\n\n\fDg\n\nDh\nBy exchanging the simple roots in a fiber of \u03c1\u2206 , we define an involution \u03c3h on the set of\nvertices of the Dynkin diagram of g.\n\n4.2\n\nA result of unicity\n\nProposition 4.1 For a fixed pair (Dg, \u03c3h) there exists at most one (up to conjugacy by an\nelement of G) spherical pair (G, H) where G is adjoint and H connected.\nProof. Obviously, G is determined by Dg. Let us fix a Borel subgroup B of G and a\nmaximal torus T of B. Let \u2206g denote the set of simple roots of G. For any \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206g, we fix\na sl2 -triple (X\u03b1 , Y\u03b1, H\u03b1 ). Consider\n2\n\n\u0398 : T \u2212\u2192 (K\u2217 )\u2206h\nt 7\u2212\u2192 (\u03b2(t)\u03b1(t\u22121 ))\n\n\u03b1 6= \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206g\n\u03c1\u2206 (\u03b1) = \u03c1\u2206 (\u03b2)\n\n.\n\nThe neutral component S of the kernel of \u0398 is a subtorus of T of dimension |\u2206g|\u2212|\u22062h| = |\u2206h|.\nMoreover, \u0398 is surjective.\nLet H be a semi-simple subgroup of G such that (G, H) is a spherical pair of minimal\nrank with (Dg, Dh, \u03c1\u2206 ) as associated triple. Let T (H) be a maximal torus of G. Up to\nconjugacy, we may assume that T (H) is contained in T . But, T (H) is contained in S; by an\nargument of dimension, we conclude that T (H) = S.\nFor all \u03b1 \u2208 \u22061g, we have g\u03b1 = h\u03c1(\u03b1) . Moreover, we claim that up to conjugacy, we may\nassume that for all \u03b1 6= \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206g such that \u03c1\u2206 (\u03b1) = \u03c1\u2206 (\u03b2) we have h\u03c1(\u03b1) = K.(X\u03b1 + X\u03b2 ).\nWe write \u22062h = {\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1k } and \u22062g = {\u03b11\u2212 , * * * , \u03b1k\u2212 } \u222a {\u03b11+ , * * * , \u03b1k+ } such that for all\ni = 1, * * * , k, \u03c1(\u03b1i\u00b1 ) = \u03b1i . By Lemma 4.4, there exist (x1 , * * * , xk ) \u2208 K\u2217 such that for all\ni = 1, * * * , k, h\u03b1i = K.(X\u03b1\u2212i + xi X\u03b1+i ). Since \u0398 is surjective, there exists t \u2208 T such that\n\u0398(t) = (x1 , * * * , xk ). By conjugating H by t, we obtain the claim.\nLet i \u2208 {1, * * * , k}. There exists y \u2208 K\u2217 such that h\u2212\u03b1i = K.(Y\u03b1\u2212i + yY\u03b1+i ). Since \u03b1i\u2212 and\n\u03b1i+ are orthogonal, \u03be := [X\u03b1\u2212i + X\u03b1+i , Y\u03b1\u2212i + yY\u03b1+i ] = H\u03b1\u2212i + yH\u03b1+i . But, \u03be belongs to the Lie\nalgebra of T (H), that is to S, so (\u03b1i\u2212 \u2212 \u03b1i+ )(\u03be) = 0. We conclude that y = 1.\nFinally, since h is generated as Lie algebra by the h\u00b1\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206h; h is generated by:\n{X\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u22061g \u222a {Y\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u22061g \u222a {X\u03b1\u2212 + X\u03b1+ }\u03b1\u2208\u22062h \u222a {Y\u03b1\u2212 + Y\u03b1+ }\u03b1\u2208\u22062h .\ni\n\ni\n\nIn particular, h only depends on the triple (Dg, \u03c3h).\n13\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u0003\n\n\f4.2.1\n\nThe case when rk(H) = 2\n\nLemma 4.3 considers the case when rk(H) = 1. We now consider the case when rk(H) =\n2:\nLemma 4.7 We assume that rk(H) = 2. Then, the possibilities for (Dg, \u03c3h) are:\n(i) (Dh, Identity) obtained with G = H.\n(ii) (Dh \u222a Dh, Exchange) obtained with H embedded diagonally in H \u00d7 H.\n(iii) Dg = A3 and \u03c3h fixes the central vertex and exchanges the two others; obtained with\nH = PSp4 \u2282 G = PSL4 :\nDg\n\nDh\n\n(iv) Dg = B3 and \u03c3h fixes the central vertex and exchanges the two others; obtained with\nG2 \u2282 SO7 :\nDg\n\nDh\n\nProof. If \u03c62h is empty, the dimensions of g and h are equal and hence g = h. From now on,\nwe assume that \u03c62h is not empty. Since \u03c62h is stable by the action of the Weyl group WH of\nH, \u22062h is non empty.\nBy invariance by WH the possibilities for colored Dynkin diagrams of h are:\n\nIn each case, using the action of WH , one can determine \u03c61h and \u03c62h and thus, compute\nthe cardinality |\u03c6g| of \u03c6g which equals |\u03c61h| + 2|\u03c62h|. Moreover, by Lemma 4.3 the two simple\nroots of g which map on a simple root of \u03c62h are orthogonal. These constraints imply a small\nnumber of possibilities for (Dg, Dh, \u03c1\u2206 ). In the following tabular, we list these possibilities\nomitting those corresponding to h \u2282 h \u00d7 h and sl2 \u00d7 sl2 \u2192 sl2 \u00d7 sl2 \u00d7 sl2 , (\u03be, \u03b7) 7\u2192 (\u03be, \u03be, \u03b7).\n\n14\n\n\fColored\nDynkin diagram\nof h\n\n(|\u03c61h|, |\u03c62h|) |\u03c6g|\n\nDynkin diagram\nof g\n\nCase\n\nh\n\n1\n\nsl3\n\n(0, 6)\n\n12\n\nsp4 \u00d7 sl2 \u00d7 sl2\n\n2\n\nsp4\n\n(0, 8)\n\n16\n\nsp4 \u00d7 sp4\n\n3\n\nsp4\n\n(4, 4)\n\n12\n\nsl4\n\n4\n\nsp4\n\n(4, 4)\n\n12\n\nsl4\n\n5\n\nG2\n\n(0, 12)\n\n24\n\nsp8\n\n6\n\nG2\n\n(6, 6)\n\n18\n\nso7\n\n7\n\nG2\n\n(6, 6)\n\n18\n\nso7\n\ng\n\nThere is no nontrivial action of the group PSL3 on P1 . But in Case 1, P1 is a factor of\nB; and H cannot have a dense orbit in B. In Case 2, the projections of h on each factor of\ng are isomorphisms: Case 2 also cannot occur.\nConsider Case 3. Let \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2) denote the short (resp. long) simple root of h. Set\n\u22121\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n1\n\u03b1 = \u03c1\u22121\n\u2206 (\u03b1) and (\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03c1\u2206 (\u03b1). By Lemma 4.5, \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c6h. So,\nh2\u03b1+\u03b2 = [h\u03b1 , h\u03b1+\u03b2 ] = [g\u03b1\u25e6 , g(\u03b1+\u03b2)\u25e6 ] = g\u03b1\u25e6 +(\u03b1+\u03b2)\u25e6 .\n15\n\n\fNow, Lemma 4.4 shows that 2\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c61\u03b1 . With Lemma 4.5, this contradicts \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c62h.\nBy elimination, the inclusion of PSp4 in PSL4 corresponds to Case 4.\nConsider Case 5. We label the simple roots of g and h as follows:\n\u03b13\n\n\u03b14\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nDg\n\nDh\n\nWe have \u03c1(\u03b13 + \u03b14 ) = \u03c1(\u03b12 + \u03b11 ) = \u03c1(\u03b12 + \u03b13 ) = \u03b1 + \u03b2; but \u03b13 + \u03b14 , \u03b12 + \u03b11 and \u03b12 + \u03b13\nare three distinct roots of g. This contradicts Lemma 4.4.\nConsider Case 6. Let \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2) denote the short (resp. long) simple root of h. By\nLemma 4.5, \u03b2 + 2\u03b1 belongs to \u03c61h. By the argument used in Case 3 before, one easily checks\nthat \u03b2 + 3\u03b1 = (\u03b2 + 2\u03b1) + \u03b1 belongs to \u03c61h. This contradicts Lemma 4.5, since \u03b2 + 3\u03b1 is a\nlong root.\nCase 7 corresponds to the inclusion of G2 in SO7 .\n\u0003\nWe may now assume that H is simple. Indeed, we have:\nProposition 4.2 Let (G, H) be a spherical pair of minimal rank with G semi-simple adjoint\nand H connected. If H is not simple then there exists two spherical pairs (G1 , H1 ) and\n(G2 , H2 ) of minimal rank such that G = G1 \u00d7 G2 and H = H1 \u00d7 H2 .\nProof. By assumption, Dh is the disjoint union of two Dynkin diagrams D1 and D2 . By\nLemmas 4.7 and 4.1, for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206g such that \u03c1(\u03b1) and \u03c1(\u03b2) are orthogonal, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\n\u22121\northogonal. We deduce that Dg is the disjoint union of \u03c1\u22121\n\u2206 (D1 ) and \u03c1\u2206 (D2 ). The proposition follows.\n\u0003\nBy Proposition 4.2, to classify all the spherical pairs (G, H) of minimal rank with G\nsimple-simple adjoint and H semi-simple, we may assume that H is simple. The Theorem A\nstated in the introduction lists all such spherical pairs. We can now prove this classification.\nProof.[of Theorem A] By Proposition 4.1, it is sufficient to classify the possible triples\n(Dg, Dh, \u03c1\u2206 ). By Lemma 4.7, we may assume that rk(H) \u2265 3. Moreover, we may assume\nthat \u22062h is non empty and different from \u2206h. Let \u03b1 \u2208 \u22062h and \u03b2 \u2208 \u22061h. By Lemma 4.7, either\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are orthogonal or \u03b1 is the short root joined to the long root \u03b2 by a double edge.\nOne easily deduces that the colored Dynkin diagram of h is one of the following:\n\n16\n\n\fOne easily deduces from Lemmas 4.1 and 4.7 than in the three preceding case the Dynkin\ndiagram Dg is respectively:\n\nThe theorem follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[BJ06]\n\nM.
