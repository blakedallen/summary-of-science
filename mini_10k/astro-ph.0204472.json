Do they form like ordinary stars from the collapse of\nmolecular cores (Shu et al. 1987)? If so, the very existence of very low-mass objects and\ntheir mass function put strong constraints on star formation theories. Alternatively, BDs\nand isolated planetary mass objects may be stellar \"embryos\" ejected from multiple forming\nsystems before reaching a stellar mass (Reipurth & Clarke 2001), or they may form like\nplanets by coagulation of dust particles and subsequent gas accretion within circumstellar\nprotoplanetary disks (Lin et al. 1998). Young (proto)-planets could then be extracted or\nejected by dynamical interactions from the forming planetary systems. In this scenario,\nisolated BDs and planetary mass objects are intrinsically different from stars; their study\nsheds no light on star formation theories, but provides instead a chance of studying the early\nevolution of giant planets where they can be observed in isolation, rather than very close to\na much brighter star.\nOne way to shed light on the origin of very low mass objects is to ascertain their\nassociation with circumstellar disks, which are characteritics of stellar formation from the\ncontraction of a molecular core. Deep images in the L band Muench et al. (2001) and\nin the mid-infrared (Persi et al. 2000; Bontemps et al. 2001) have shown that many very\nlow luminosity objects have excess emission at these wavelengths, and detailed studies of\nsome of them have proven that the central objects are bona-fide BDs. Their infrared excess\nis consistent with the presence of a surrounding disk similar to those found around more\nmassive pre-main sequence stars (Comer\u00f3n et al. 1998, 2000; Natta & Testi 2001). These\ninitial findings, albeit limited, seem to suggest that indeed BDs form like ordinary stars.\nWe report here the first results of a project aimed on one hand to improve our understanding of disks around BD, following the approach of in Natta & Testi (2001), and on\nthe other hand to find evidence of a circumstellar disk around bona fide isolated planetary\nmass objects. We have used the Near-Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (NICS) on the\n3.56m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo to acquire low-resolution (NIR) spectra of a sample of\nmid-infrared sources located within the \u03c1-Ophiuchi cloud Bontemps et al. (2001). Our target list included objects detected at 6.7 and 14.3 \u03bcm with the ISOCAM camera on board\nof ISO (Kessler et al. 1996; Cesarsky et al. 1996), having low effective temperature (Tef f ),\nluminosity (L\u2217 ) and extinction (AV ) based on photometric or limited 2.2 \u03bcm spectroscopic\nestimates. The goal of our new observations was to obtain improved determinations of these\nparameters and to derive accurate values of masses and ages of the targets by comparison\nwith theoretical evolutionary tracks. The results for the complete sample will be discussed\nelsewhere (Natta et al. 2002). In this Letter, we report on one of the sources, number 33 of\nthe ISOCAM list of Bontemps et al. (2001), which is associated with the NIR source GY11\n(Greene & Young 1992). The substellar nature of this object was already proposed by Rieke\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n& Rieke (1990) and confirmed by Comer\u00f3n et al. (1998); Wilking et al. (1999). We derive a\nnew, accurate spectral classification of GY11, and of its effective temperature and luminosity.\nOur data suggest that GY11 is a planetary mass object, with an infrared excess that can be\nroughly modeled as due to a circumstellar disk similar to those associated to T Tauri stars.\nThese observations provide the first evidence that objects of such small mass actually form\nin a star-like manner, and thus that they are genetically different from \"planets\".\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nA near-infrared low-resolution spectrum of GY11 was obtained with the Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo on La Palma on July 9, 2001, using a 0.\u2032\u2032 5 slit and the high-throughput\nlow-resolution prism-based disperser unique to NICS (Baffa et al. 2001), the Amici device\n(Oliva 2000); this setup offers a complete NIR spectrum, 0.85 to 2.35 \u03bcm, at R\u223c100 accross\nthe entire range, and it allows an accurate classification of faint and cool dwarfs (Testi et al.\n2001). Instrumental and telluric correction was ensured by observations of A0 stars. The\nshape of the final spectrum was checked using near infrared photometric measurements from\nthe 2MASS second incremental data release; synthetic magnitudes were computed using the\nappropriate transmission curves and compared with the source photometry, colors were found\nto be consistent with those of 2MASS to within 10%, as expected from typical uncertainties.\nTo better constrain the values of the extinction, we also obtained optical i-band (0.77 \u03bcm)\nphotometry at the ESO-La Silla 1.54m Danish Telescope using the DFOSC instrument.\nPhotometric calibration was ensured by observations of a set of Landolt (1992) standard\nstars, converted into the Gunn system using the transformations given by Fukugita et al.\n(1996).\n\n3.\n\nCentral source parameters\n\nBontemps et al. (2001) associated the ISOCAM source 33 with a Class II object member\nof the \u03c1-Ophiuchi young stellar cluster known as GY11 (Greene & Young 1992). The brown\ndwarf nature of GY11 has been suspected for some time (Rieke & Rieke 1990). However,\nthere is a large uncertainty in the literature as to the exact value of its photospheric parameters and mass. Bontemps et al. (2001) estimate bolometric luminosity and extinction\nto be L\u2217 \u223c 0.001 L\u2299 , AV =2.7 mag from NIR photometry. Based on multiband infrared\nphotometry and a 2.2\u03bcm low resolution spectrum, Wilking et al. (1999) estimate a spectral\ntype M6.5, AV \u223c5 mag, L\u2217 \u223c0.002 L\u2299 , and Tef f \u223c2650 K. These authors noted that due to\nveiling caused by dust emission, the spectral type could easily be some 2\u20133 subclasses later,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nand the extinction significantly underestimated. In fact, Comer\u00f3n et al. (1998) derive a\nhigher value of AV =10 mag from broadband photometric measurements that include optical\nand infrared bands.\nOur complete near infrared spectrum offers the possibility of a better estimate of the\nsource parameters, as it allow us to use the global spectrum shape below 2 \u03bcm, a region\nwhich is less affected by the continuum veiling due to the dust emission. Given the expectation that the surface gravity of very young BDs shouls be similar to sub-giants, we derive the\nphotospheric parameters by comparison with field dwarfs spectra and model atmospheres\nwith appropriate surface gravity, as suggested by the evolutionary models (Comer\u00f3n et al.\n2000). We first derive extinction and spectral type by matching the observed GY11 spectrum with that of field dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (Testi et al. 2002), obtained with\nthe same instrumental set-up and reddened using the Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law\nmost appropriate for Ophiucus (RV =4.2; Fig. 1a). We try to provide the best fit to the\nglobal shape of the spectrum, with particular attention to the shape of the H-band, the\nJ-band features and the drop due to water vapor absorption at the red edge of the J-band.\nOverall, the best spectral match is found with the field dwarf with spectral type M8.5 and\nextinction AV \u223c7.0 mag. Lower values of AV (by \u223c 1 mag) offer a better match of the\nspectrum with later dwarf spectra (M9\u2013L0), but are not consistent with the broad band\noptical measurements (see inset in Fig. 4). A higher value of the extinction causes a too\nsteep rise of the spectrum below 1.2 \u03bcm. Field dwarfs with spectral types earlier than M7.5\nshow large deviations from the observed shape of the H-band and the drop at 1.3 \u03bcm. Given\nthe uncertainties of a classification based on objects with very different surface gravity, we\nexpect our classification to be accurate within one spectral class and the visual extinction\nestimate within one magnitude.\nAs a second step, in order to derive an estimate of the photospheric effective temperature\n(Fig. 1a), we compare the observed GY11 spectrum, with reddened, appropriate surface\ngravity, log10 (g)=3.5, model atmospheres (Allard et al. 2000; Chabrier et al. 2000). The\nbest estimate of the effective temperature is \u223c2400\u00b1100 K. Higher temperature models offer\na better match of the H-band shape, but underestimate the drop near 1.3 \u03bcm and the global\nshape of the spectrum at J-band. The derivation of the effective temperature of young dwarfs\nbased on theoretical synthesis of the near infrared spectrum is very uncertain (Lodieu et al.\n2002); however, our value of Tef f for an object of spectral type M8.5 is consistent with\nthe spectral type vs. effective temperature scale discussed by Wilking et al. (1999), and\nonly marginally higher than the latest effective temperature scales derived for field dwarfs\n(Leggett et al. 2001).\nTo estimate the luminosity (L\u2217 ) of the object, we used the 2MASS J-band magnitude,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndereddened by AV \u223c 7.0 mag, and the bolometric correction derived from the best fitting\n(2400 K) atmospheric model. The value of this \"theoretical\" bolometric correction is nearly\nidentical to the empirical value adopted by Wilking et al. (1999). We derive a value of\nL\u2217 \u223c0.008 L\u2299 \u00b130%.\nUsing the L\u2217 and Tef f values derived above, we can compare the position of GY11 in the\nHertzprung-Russell diagram with the predictions of theoretical pre-main sequence evolutionary models. In Figure 2 we show this comparison for the latest release of evolutionary tracks\nfrom three leading groups in the theory of pre-main sequence evolution of substellar objects.\nIn spite of the relatively large uncertainties on L\u2217 and Tef f , and on the limited accuracy of\npre-main sequence evolutionary tracks at these ages and masses, we confirm that GY11 is\na young (\u03c4 < 1 Myr), very low mass object, probably below or very close to the deuterium\nburning limit, with a best mass estimate in the range 7 to 12 MJupiter .\n\n4.\n\nInfrared Excess and Disk Models\n\nGY11 is the lowest mass object with a clearly detected infrared excess. It is detected by\nISOCAM in the two broad-band filters LW2 and LW3 (\u03bbef f 6.7 and 14.3 \u03bcm, respectively)\nused by (Bontemps et al. 2001) in their \u03c1 Oph survey, as well as in the three intermediateband filters, SW1, LW1, LW4 (\u03bbef f =3.6, 4.5 and 6.0 \u03bcm, respectively), used by Comer\u00f3n et\nal. (1998) in their pointed observations of optically identified candidate brown dwarfs. The\nISOCAM measurements in the broad- and narrow-bands are in good agreement, within the\nflux calibration uncertainties, which we assume to be \u223c 20%.\nAs usually with ISOCAM, the \u223c6\u2032\u2032 beam includes multiple sources seen in higher resolution near-infrared images, which may contribute to the observed fluxes. Figure 3 compares\na Ks image of the region around GY11 extracted from the VLT/ESO archive (originally\nobserved as part of ESO proposal 63.I-0691) and the ISOCAM LW1 (\u03bbef f =4.5 \u03bcm) image\nfrom the ISO archive (Comer\u00f3n et al. 1998). The mid-infrared emission peaks very close to\nthe position of GY11. Although a small contamination from the NIR source \u223c8\u2032\u2032 to the east\nis possible, we think that most of the mid-infrared observed flux comes from GY11; a similar\nconclusion was also reached by Comer\u00f3n et al. (1998).\nIn Figure 4, we show the spectral energy distribution (SED) of GY 11 at all wavelengths\nand compare it to that of an irradiated, flared disk similar to those that reproduce the\nobserved characteristics of TTauri systems (Chiang & Goldreich 1997). The disk has a dust\nmass of 1 Earth mass (\u223c3% of the mass of the central object, for an assumed gas-to-dust\nmass ratio of 100) and is heated by a a central source with the GY11 temperature, luminosity\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nand mass. We show the predicted SED when the disk extends inward to the stellar surface\n(solid line) and when it has an inner hole of 3 stellar radii (dotted line). More details on the\ndisk models can be found in Natta & Testi (2001) and Natta et al. (2002). The agreement\nbetween observed and predicted fluxes is rather good, especially for the disk with the large\ninner hole. In particular, both models predict total (star+disk) fluxes that in the J, H, K\nbands are smaller than the calibrated TNG fluxes by 15% at most.\nAs an independent check, we computed optical and NIR broad-band magnitudes from\nthe model-predicted SED. They are compared in the inset of Figure 4 with the observed\ndereddened magnitudes in i (this paper), R,I,L\u2032 (Comer\u00f3n et al. 1998), J,H,K (2MASS). The\nagreement is again quite good.\nThe ISOCAM measurements, especially that at 14.3 \u03bcm, have large error bars, and one\nshould not overinterpret them. However, is of some interest to point out that, if indeed the\nmid-infrared excess is due to disk emission, the disk must be flared. Therefore, dust and gas\nmust be well mixed, as in the majority of pre-main\u2013sequence stars, and no major settling\nof the dust onto the disk midplane has occurred during the lifetime of GY11. The disk\nmust be optically thick to mid-infrared radiation; this however sets only a lower limit to the\ndisk mass of roughly 10\u22125 -10\u22126 M\u2299 depending on the exact value of the dust mid-infrared\nopacity and surface density profile. Note that the disk mass has to be very small; if we\nassume the ratio of the disk mass to the mass of the central object typical of TTS ( 0.03),\nthen the disk mass is about 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 , and the disk contains only 1 Earth mass of dust.\nAs a consequence, the accretion rate (if any) is also likely to be low, with an average value\nover the lifetime of the object that cannot exceed 3\u00d710\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (for an age of 1 Myr).\nThe accretion luminosity is also small, about 40 times lower than the luminosity of the\nphotosphere. A direct determination of the disk mass can be derived from (sub)millimeter\nwavelength observations. We predict for GY11 a 1.3mm flux of about 0.6 mJy, which is\nwell below the upper limit set by the survey of Motte et al. (1998), but within the expected\ncapabilities of the ALMA millimeter array.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results presented in this letter show evidence that a young isolated planetary mass\nobjects in \u03c1-Oph, with mass of about 10 MJ , is surrounded by warm dust, possibly distributed\non a disk similar in properties to those around young brown dwarfs and T Tauri stars.\nThe implications of this finding, that should be confirmed by higher spatial resolution midinfrared observations, and should be extended to a large sample of similar objects, are\nprofound, since it gives a clear indication that isolated BDs and even planetary mass objects\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nform like stars and are not produced in a planet-like fashion within protoplanetary disks\naround more massive objects, and later ejected by dynamical interactions. Isolated BDs and\nplanetary mass objects are thus an extension of the stellar and substellar sequence to very\nlow masses and have different origins from \"planets\".\nThis work is partly based on observations collected at the Italian Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo, Canary Islands, Spain, at the European Southern Observatory telescopes on La\nSilla and Paranal observatories, Chile, and on data obtained by the European Space Agency\nInfrared Space Observatory.

The green jagged line is the photospheric model\nfor Tef f =2400 K and Log(g)=3.5 (Allard et al. 2000). The blue lines show the combined\nphotosphere plus disk emission computed as in the text. In one case (solid line) the disk\ninner radius is equal to R\u22c6 , in the other (dotted line) to 3R\u22c6 .
