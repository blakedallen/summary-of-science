Introduction\nThe filled skutterudite compound PrOs4 Sb12 has been reported to exhibit superconductivity below a critical temperature Tc = 1.85 K that develops out of a heavy Fermi liquid with an effective mass m\u2217 \u2248 50 me , where me\nis the free electron mass [1, 2, 3, 4] . To our knowledge, PrOs4 Sb12 is the first\nheavy fermion superconductor based on Pr; all of the other known heavy\nfermion superconductors (about 20) are compounds of Ce or U. The superconducting state appears to be unconventional in nature and may consist\nof two distinct superconducting phases [3, 5]. An ordered phase, presumably of magnetic or quadrupolar origin, occurs at high fields > 4.5 T and\n\u2217\n\nPresented at the Strongly Correlated Electron Systems Conference, Krak\u00f3w 2002\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\nlow temperatures < 1.5 K [3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], suggesting that the superconductivity may occur in the vicinity of a magnetic or quadrupolar quantum\ncritical point (QCP). Analysis of magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ), specific heat\nC(T ), electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) and inelastic neutron scattering measurements within the context of a cubic crystalline electric field (CEF) yields a\nPr3+ energy level scheme that consists of a \u03933 nonmagnetic doublet ground\nstate that carries an electric quadrupole moment, a low lying \u03935 triplet excited state at \u223c 10 K, and \u03934 triplet and \u03931 singlet excited states at much\nhigher temperatures (\u223c 130 K and \u223c 313 K, respectively) [1, 2, 3, 4]. This\nscenario suggests that the underlying mechanism of the heavy fermion behavior in PrOs4 Sb12 may involve the interaction of Pr3+ electric quadrupole\nmoments with the charges of the conduction electrons, rather than the interaction of Pr3+ magnetic dipole moments with the spins of the conduction\nelectrons, the interaction that is widely believed to be responsible for the\nheavy fermion state in most Ce- and U-based compounds. It also raises\nthe possibility that electric quadrupole fluctuations play a role in the superconductivity of PrOs4 Sb12 . In this paper, we briefly review the current\nexperimental situation regarding the heavy fermion state, the superconducting state, and a high field, low temperature phase that is apparently\nassociated with magnetic or electric quadrupolar order in PrOs4 Sb12 .\n2. Heavy fermion state in PrOs4 Sb12\nThe first evidence for a heavy fermion state in the filled skutterudite\ncompound PrOs4 Sb12 emerged from specific heat C(T ) measurements on\na PrOs4 Sb12 pressed pellet (formed by pressing a collection of small single\ncrystals in a cylindrical die) at low temperatures. Specific heat data in the\nform of a plot of C/T vs T between 0.5 K and 10 K for the PrOs4 Sb12\npressed pellet from Refs. [1] and [2] are shown in Fig. 1. The C(T ) data\nhave been corrected for excess Sb derived from the molten Sb flux in which\nthe crystals were grown. The line in the figure represents the expression\nC(T ) = \u03b3T + \u03b2T 3 + CSch (T ), where \u03b3T and \u03b2T 3 are electronic and phonon\ncontributions, respectively, and CSch (T ) is a Schottky anomaly for a two\nlevel system consisting of a doublet ground state and a triplet excited state\nat an energy \u2206 above the ground state. The best fit of this expression\nto the data yields the values \u03b3 = 607 mJ/mol K2 , \u03b2 = 3.95 mJ/mol K4\n(corresponding to a Debye temperature \u03b8D = 203 K), and \u2206 = 7.15 K.\nSuperimposed on the Schottky anomaly is a feature in the specific heat due\nto the onset of superconductivity at Tc = 1.85 K which is also observed as\nan abrupt drop in \u03c1(T ) to zero and as a sharp onset of diamagnetism in\n\u03c7(T ). The feature in C(T )/T due to the superconductivity is also shown in\nthe top inset of Fig. 1 along with an entropy conserving construction from\n\n\fSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\n3\n\nwhich the ratio of the jump in specific heat \u2206C at Tc , \u2206C/Tc = 632 mJ/mol\nK2 , has been estimated. Using the BCS relation \u2206C/\u03b3Tc = 1.43, this yields\na value for \u03b3 of 440 mJ/mol K2 . The value of \u2206C/Tc is larger than that\nreported in Ref. [2] due to the correction of the C(T ) data for the excess\nSb (about 30 percent of the total mass). This value is comparable to that\ninferred from the fit to the C/T vs T data in the normal state above Tc , and\nindicative of heavy fermion behavior. A similar analysis of the C(T ) data\ntaken at the University of Karlsruhe on several single crystals of PrOs4 Sb12\nprepared in our laboratory yielded \u03b3 = 313 mJ/mol K2 , \u03b8D = 165 K,\n\u2206 = 7 K, and \u2206C/\u03b3Tc \u2248 3, much higher than the BCS value of 1.43 and\nindicative of strong coupling effects [6]. It is interesting that we also find\na large value of \u2206C/\u03b3Tc \u2248 3 in recent C(T ) measurements on one single\ncrystal of PrOs4 Sb12 at UCSD. Although the values of \u03b3 determined from\nthese experiments vary somewhat, they are all indicative of a heavy electron\nground state and an effective mass m\u2217 \u2248 50 me .\n\nFurther evidence of heavy fermion superconductivity is provided by the\nupper critical field Hc2 vs T curve which is shown in Fig. 2 [2, 3]. The orbital\n\u2217 (0) can be derived from the slope of the H\ncritical field Hc2\nc2 curve near Tc\nand used to estimate the superconducting coherence length \u03be0 \u2248 116 \u00c5\n\u2217 (0) = \u03a6 /2\u03c0\u03be 2 , where \u03a6 is the flux quantum. The\nvia the relation Hc2\n0\n0\n0\nFermi velocity vF can be obtained from the BCS relation \u03be0 = 0.18h\u0304vF /kB Tc\nand used to determine the effective mass m\u2217 by means of the expression\nm\u2217 = h\u0304kF /vF . Using a simple free electron model to estimate the Fermi\nwave vector kF , an effective mass m\u2217 \u2248 50 me is obtained [2, 3]. Calculating\n\u03b3 from m\u2217 yields \u03b3 \u223c 350 mJ/mol K2 , providing further evidence for a heavy\nfermion state in PrOs4 Sb12 .\n\nRecently, Sugawara et al. [10] performed de Haas-van Alphen effect measurements on PrOs4 Sb12 . They found that the topology of the Fermi surface is close to that of the reference compound LaOs4 Sb12 and is explained\nwell by band structure calculations. In contrast to the similarity in the\nFermi surface topologies of PrOs4 Sb12 and LaOs4 Sb12 , the cyclotron effective masses m\u2217c of PrOs4 Sb12 are up to \u223c 6 times enhanced compared to\nthose of LaOs4 Sb12 . The Sommerfeld coefficient \u03b3 estimated from the Fermi\nsurface volume and the value of m\u2217c , assuming a spherical Fermi surface, is\n\u223c 150 mJ/mol K2 , which is two to three times smaller than the value of\n\u03b3 inferred from the normal and superconducting properties of PrOs4 Sb12 .\nOur studies of LaOs4 Sb12 single crystals reveal superconductivity with a Tc\nof 1 K.\n\n\f4\n\nSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\n3. The Pr3+ energy level scheme in the crystalline electric field\nMagnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) data between \u223c 1 K and room temperature\nfor PrOs4 Sb12 from Ref. [2] are shown in Fig. 3. These \u03c7(T ) data have been\ncorrected for excess Sb by assuming the effective moment \u03bceff was equal\nto the full Hund's rule value of 3.6 \u03bcB . This led to an estimation of the\nmass of the excess Sb to be \u223c 25% of the total mass. The \u03c7(T ) data\nexhibit a peak at \u223c 3 K and saturate to a value of \u223c 0.11 cm3 /mol as\nT \u2192 0, indicative of a nonmagnetic ground state. At temperatures above\n\u223c 5 K, \u03c7(T ) is strongly T-dependent, as expected for well defined Pr3+\nmagnetic moments. In the analysis of the \u03c7(T ) data, interactions between\nPr3+ ions and hybridization of the Pr 4f and conduction electron states were\nneglected, while the degeneracy of the Hund's rule multiplet of the Pr3+\nions was assumed to be lifted by a cubic crystalline electric field (CEF) and\nto have a nonmagnetic ground state. According to Lea, Leask, and Wolf\n[11], in a cubic CEF, the Pr3+ J = 4 Hund's rule multiplet splits into a\n\u03931 singlet, a \u03933 nonmagnetic doublet that carries an electric quadrupole\nmoment, and \u03934 and \u03935 triplets. It was assumed that the nonmagnetic\nground state of the Pr3+ ions corresponds to either a \u03931 singlet or a \u03933\nnonmagnetic doublet [2]. Although reasonable fits to the \u03c7(T ) data could\nbe obtained for both \u03931 and \u03933 ground states, as shown in Fig. 3, the most\nsatisfactory fit was obtained for a \u03933 nonmagnetic doublet ground state\nwith a \u03935 first excited triplet state at 11 K and \u03934 and \u03931 excited states at\n130 K and 313 K, respectively (see the inset to Fig. 3). Inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements on PrOs4 Sb12 [3] reveal peaks in the INS spectrum\nat 0.71 meV (8.2 K) and 11.5 meV (133 K) that appear to be associated\nwith transitions between the \u03933 ground state and the \u03935 first and \u03934 second\nexcited states, respectively, that are in good agreement with the Pr3+ CEF\nenergy level scheme determined from the analysis of the \u03c7(T ) data. As\nnoted above, the Schottky anomaly in the C(T ) data on PrOs4 Sb12 taken\nat UCSD and at the University of Karlsruhe [6] can be described well by a\ntwo level system consisting of a doublet ground state and a low lying triplet\nexcited state with a splitting of \u223c 7 K, a value that is comparable to the\nvalues deduced from the \u03c7(T ) and INS data. However, a \u03931 ground state\ncannot, at this point, be completely excluded.\nWhile a magnetic \u03934 or \u03935 Pr3+ ground state could also produce a nonmagnetic heavy fermion ground state via an antiferromagnetic exchange\ninteraction (Kondo effect), the behavior of \u03c1(T ) of PrOs4 Sb12 in the normal state does not resemble the behavior of \u03c1(T ) expected for this scenario.\nFor a typical magnetically-induced heavy fermion compound, \u03c1(T ) often\nincreases with decreasing temperature due to Kondo scattering, reaches a\nmaximum, and then decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature as the\n\n\fSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\n5\n\nhighly correlated heavy fermion state forms below the coherence temperature. At low temperatures, \u03c1(T ) typically varies as AT 2 with a prefactor\nA \u2248 10\u22125 [\u03bc\u03a9 cm K2 (mJ/mol)\u22122 ] \u03b3 2 that is consistent with the KadowakiWoods relation [12]. In contrast, \u03c1(T ) of PrOs4 Sb12 , shown in Fig. 4 [1, 2],\nexhibits typical metallic behavior with negative curvature at higher temperatures and a pronounced 'roll off' below \u223c 8 K before it vanishes abruptly\nwhen the compound becomes superconducting (upper inset of Fig. 4). The\ntemperature of the 'roll off' in \u03c1(T ) is close to that of the decrease in charge\nor spin dependent scattering due to the decrease in population of the proposed first excited state (\u03935 ) as the temperature is lowered. The \u03c1(T ) data\nare shown in the lower inset of Fig. 4 and can be described by a temperature\ndependence of the form AT 2 between \u223c 8 K and 45 K, but with a prefactor\nA \u2248 0.009 \u03bc\u03a9 cm/K2 that is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthat expected from the Kadowaki-Woods relation (A \u2248 1.2 \u03bc\u03a9 cm/K2 for\n\u03b3 \u2248 350 mJ/mol K2 ) [12]. Interestingly, \u03c1(T ) is consistent with T 2 behavior\nwith a value A \u2248 1 \u03bc\u03a9 cm/K2 in fields of \u223c 5 T [4] in the high field ordered phase discussed in section 5. The zero-field temperature dependence\nof \u03c1(T ) is similar to that observed for the compound PrInAg2 , which also\nhas a low value of the coefficient A, an enormous \u03b3 of \u223c 6.5 J/mol K2 , and\na \u03933 nonmagnetic doublet ground state [13]. The compounds PrOs4 Sb12 ,\nPrInAg2 , and another Pr-based skutterudite, PrFe4 P12 [14], may belong to\na new class of heavy fermion compounds in which the heavy fermion state is\nproduced by electric quadrupole fluctuations. In contrast, magnetic dipole\nfluctuations are widely believed to be responsible for the heavy fermion state\nin most Ce and U heavy fermion compounds (with the possible exception\nof certain U compounds such as UBe13 ). Another possible source of the enhanced effective mass in PrOs4 Sb12 may involve excitations from the ground\nstate to the the low lying first excited state in the Pr3+ CEF energy level\nscheme [15].\nTwo studies of the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility have been performed in an attempt to determine the CEF ground state of the Pr3+ ion in\nPrOs4 Sb12 [8, 16]. The nonlinear susceptibility \u03c73 is the coefficient of an H 3\nterm in the expansion of the magnetization M in a series of odd powers of\nH; i.e., M \u2248 \u03c71 H + (\u03c73 /6)H 3 , where \u03c71 is the ordinary linear susceptibility. For an ionic situation, \u03c73 is isotropic and varies as T \u22123 for a magnetic\nground state, whereas for a non-Kramers \u03933 doublet it is anisotropic and\ndiverges at low temperatures for H || [100] and approaches a constant for\nH || [111] [17]. This type of study was previously employed in an attempt\nto determine the ground state of U in the compound UBe13 [18]. In the\nstudy by Bauer et al. [16], \u03c73 was found to be anisotropic and exhibit a\nminimum followed by a maximum and a negative divergence as the temperature was decreased for H || [100], while \u03c73 exhibited a minimum and then\n\n\f6\n\nSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\nincreased down to the lowest temperature of the measurement (T = 1.8 K),\nfor H || [111]. Comparison with calculations based on the quadrupolar\nAnderson-Hamiltonian provided a qualitative description of the \u03c73 (T ) data\nfor H || [100], but did not describe the \u03c73 (T ) data well for H || [111]. It\nwas concluded that the data were qualitatively consistent with a \u03933 ground\nstate, given the limits of the experiment and the complexity of the theory.\nOn the other hand, a study by Tenya et al. [8] found \u03c73 (T ) to be nearly\nisotropic. It was concluded that the a \u03931 ground state could not be ruled\nout on the basis of this experiment. However, it should be noted that these\n\u03c73 (T ) studies are difficult to interpret because of the curvature of M (H)\nand the complications that arise at lower temperatures T \u2264 Tc and lower\nfields H \u2264 Hc2 due to the superconductivity and at temperatures T \u2264 2 K\nand higher fields H \u2265 4.5 K by the onset of the high field ordered phase,\ndiscussed in section 5.\n4. Superconducting state\nSeveral features in the superconducting properties of PrOs4 Sb12 indicate\nthat the superconductivity of this compound is unconventional in nature.\nFirst, Cs (T ) follows a power law T-dependence, Cs (T ) \u223c T 2.5 , after the\nSchottky anomaly and \u03b2T 3 lattice contributions have been subtracted from\nthe C(T ) data. As reported in Ref. [3], Cs (T ) follows a power law with\nCs (T ) \u223c T 3.9 when the Schottky anomaly is not subtracted. Second, there\nis a 'double-step' structure in the jump in C(T ) near Tc in single crystals\n(lower inset of Fig. 1) that suggests two distinct superconducting phases\nwith different Tc 's: Tc1 \u2248 1.70 K and Tc2 \u2248 1.85 K [3, 6]. This structure is\nnot evident in the C(T ) data taken on the pressed pellet of PrOs4 Sb12 shown\nin the upper inset of Fig. 1, possibly due to strains in the single crystals\nout of which the pressed pellet is comprised that broaden the transitions at\nTc1 and Tc2 so that they overlap and become indistinguishable. However,\nat this point, it is not clear whether these two apparent jumps in C(T ) are\nassociated with two distinct superconducting phases or are due to sample\ninhomogeneity. It is noteworthy that all of the single crystal specimens prepared in our laboratory and investigated by our group and our collaborators\nexhibit this 'double-step' structure. Multiple superconducting transitions,\napparently associated with distinct superconducting phases, have previously\nbeen observed in two other heavy fermion superconductors, UPt3 [19] and\nU1\u2212x Thx Be13 (0.1 \u2264 x \u2264 0.35) [20]. Measurements of the specific heat\nin magnetic fields reveal that the two superconducting features shift downward in temperature at nearly the same rate with increasing field, consistent\nwith the smooth temperature dependence of the Hc2 (T ) curve [6]. These\ntwo transitions have also been observed in thermal expansion measurements\n\n\fSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\n7\n\n[7], which, from the Ehrenfest relation, reveal that Tc1 and Tc2 have different\npressure dependencies, suggesting that they are associated with two distinct\nsuperconducting phases.\nRecent transverse field \u03bcSR [21] and Sb-NQR measurements [22] on\nPrOs4 Sb12 are consistent with an isotropic energy gap. Along with the specific heat, these measurements indicate strong coupling superconductivity.\nThese findings suggest an s-wave, or, perhaps, a Balian-Werthamer p-wave\norder parameter. On the other hand, the superconducting gap structure\nof PrOs4 Sb12 was investigated by means of thermal conductivity measurements in magnetic fields rotated relative to the crystallographic axes by\nIzawa et al. [5]. These measurements reveal two regions in the H \u2212 T plane,\na low field region in which \u2206(k) has two point nodes, and a high field region\nwhere \u2206(k) has six point nodes. The line lying between the low and high\nfield superconducting phases may be associated with the transition at Tc2 ,\nwhereas the line between the high field phase and the normal phase, Hc2 (T ),\nconverges with Tc1 as H \u2192 0. Clearly, more research will be required to\nfurther elucidate the nature of the superconducting state in PrOs4 Sb12 .\n5. High field ordered phase\nEvidence for a high field ordered phase was first derived from magnetoresistance measurements in the temperature range 80 mK \u2264 T \u2264 2 K and\nmagnetic fields up to 9 tesla [3, 23]. The H \u2212 T phase diagram, depicting\nthe superconducting region and the high field ordered phase is shown in\nFig. 2. The line that intersects the high field ordered state represents the\ninflection point of the 'roll-off' in \u03c1(T ) at low temperatures and is a measure\nof the splitting between the Pr3+ ground state and the first excited state,\nwhich decreases with field (see Fig. 4). The high field ordered phase has\nalso been observed by means of large peaks in the specific heat [6, 9] and\nthermal expansion [7] and kinks in magnetization vs magnetic field curves\n[8, 23] in magnetic fields > 4.5 T and temperatures < 1.5 K.\nShown in Fig. 5 are \u03c1(T ) data for various magnetic fields up to 9 T\nfor PrOs4 Sb12 , which reveal drops in \u03c1(T ) due to the superconductivity for\nH \u2264 2.3 T and features in \u03c1(T ) associated with the onset of the high field\nordered phase for H \u2265 4.5 T. Isotherms of electrical resistance R vs H and\nmagnetization M vs H are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. The\nfields denoting the boundaries of the high field ordered phase, H1\u2217 and H2\u2217 ,\nare indicated in the figure.\n6. Summary\nExperiments on the filled skutterudite compound PrOs4 Sb12 have revealed a number of extraordinary phenomena: a heavy fermion state char-\n\n\f8\n\nSCESPrOs4Sb12final\n\nprinted on October 8, 2018\n\nacterized by an effective mass m\u2217 \u2248 50 me , unconventional superconductivity below Tc = 1.85 K with two distinct superconducting phases, and a high\nfield ordered phase, presumably associated with magnetic or electric quadrupolar order. Analysis of \u03c7(T ), C(T ), \u03c1(T ), and INS data indicate that\nPr3+ has a nonmagnetic \u03933 doublet ground state that carries an electric\nquadrupole moment, a low lying \u03935 triplet excited state at \u223c 10 K, and \u03934\ntriplet and \u03931 singlet excited states at much higher energies. This suggests\nthat the interaction between the quadrupole moments of the Pr3+ ions and\nthe charges of the conduction electrons, as well as the excitations between\nthe \u03933 ground state and \u03935 low lying excited state may play an important\nrole in generating the heavy fermion state and superconductivity in this\ncompound. The heavy fermion state and unconventional superconductivity\nwill constitute a significant challenge for theoretical description [24].\n7.
