Further more, essentially\nall of the biological functions of DNA are performed by\nproteins that interact with specific DNA sequences [3, 4],\nand these reactions are diffusion-controlled.\nHowever, it has been realized that some proteins are\nable to find their specific binding sites on DNA much\nmore rapidly than is 'allowed' by the diffusion limit [1, 5].\nIt is therefore generally accepted that some kind of facilitated diffusion must take place in these cases. Several\nmechanisms, differing in details, have been proposed. All\nof them essentially involve two steps: the binding to a\nrandom non-specific DNA site and the diffusion (sliding)\nalong the DNA chain. These two steps may be reiterated many times before proteins actually find their target, since the sliding is occasionally interrupted by dissociation. Berg [5] and Zhou [6] have provided thorough\n(but somewhat sophisticated) theories that allow estimates for the resulting reaction rates. Recently, Halford\nhas presented a comprehensive review on this subject and\nproposed a remarkably simple and semiquantitative approach that explicitly contains the mean sliding length\nas a parameter of the theory [7]. This approach has been\nrefined and put onto a rigorous base in a recent work by\nthe authors [8].\nAlthough analytical models provide a good general understanding of the problem, they fail to give quantitative\npredictions for systems of realistic complexity. Therefore, numerical simulations are required to calibrate the\nset of parameters that form the backbone of these mod-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: merlitz@gmx.de\n\nels. However, a straight forward simulation of a protein\nsearching through mega-bases of non-target DNA to find\nits specific binding site would be prohibitive for all except for the most simple numerical models. Fortunately,\nthere are better ways. Two of the authors (KK and JL)\nhave recently introduced the method of excess collisions\n(MEC) for an efficient simulation of intramolecular reactions in polymers [9]. In the present work, this method\nis modified to apply to second order diffusion controlled\nchemical reactions (Section 2.1). We thereby construct a\nsimple random walk approach to facilitated diffusion of\nDNA-binding proteins (Section 2.2) and apply the MEC\nand our analytical estimate for reaction times to this\nmodel (Section 2.3 and 2.4). Section 3 provides details\nabout the generation of DNA-chains, followed by a set of\nsimulations covering a large range of system dimensions\n(Section 5) to verify the performance of the MEC.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nTHEORY\n\nMethod of excess collisions (MEC)\n\nWe consider a (time-homogeneous) stochastic process.\nThe problem is to find the average time \u03c4BA of the first\narrival at a certain state A, provided that, at time t = 0,\nthe system occupied another state B.\nSuppose we observe the system for a long time interval T and monitor the events of entering state A. These\nevents will be referred to as collisions. Each collision\nthat occurs for the first time after visiting state B will\nbe called prime collision. We obtain the (asymptotically\ncorrect for T \u2192 \u221e) relation\nT = n(T ) \u03c4R = n\u2032 (T ) \u03c4R\u2032 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n(T ) and n\u2032 (T ) are the average numbers of all\nand of prime collisions during the time interval T , respectively, and \u03c4R and \u03c4R\u2032 are the corresponding mean\n\n\f2\nrecurrence times. Hence,\n\u03c4R\u2032 =\n\nn(T )\n\u03c4R \u2261 N \u03c4R .\nn\u2032 (T )\n\n(2)\n\nThe ratio N \u2261 n(T )/n\u2032 (T ) defines the average number of\ncollisions between two visits to state B and does actually\nnot depend on T , once T is chosen sufficiently large. The\nmean recurrence time \u03c4R\u2032 of prime collisions is simply the\naverage time the system requires to move from state A\nto B and back from state B to A:\n\u03c4R\u2032 = \u03c4AB + \u03c4BA ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c4AB is the mean time of first arrival at state B\nstarting from A. With eq. (2) we then obtain\n\u03c4BA = N \u03c4R \u2212 \u03c4AB .\n\n\u03c4BA \u2261 (NE + 1) \u03c4R ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c4AB\n\u03c4R\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\nis the mean number of excess collisions per simulation\ncycle [9], since the ratio \u03c4AB /\u03c4R is just the mean number\nof collisions that would be observed in a simulation run\nof length \u03c4AB with a starting point at an arbitrary state\nof the system (not necessary state A).\n2.2.\n\np = exp(\u2212Eo /kB T ) ,\n\nSimple model for facilitated diffusion of\nDNA-binding proteins\n\nWe consider a spherical volume (cell) of radius R and\ninside it a worm-like chain (DNA) of length L and radius\nrc . The protein is represented as a random walker moving inside the cell with a certain time step dt. A collision\ntakes place once the walker enters the active binding site,\na spherical volume of radius ra positioned in the middle\nof the chain that, in its turn, coincides with the center\n\n(9)\n\nwhere kB T is the Boltzmann factor, otherwise it is reflected back inside the chain. We may therefore denote p\nas exit probability. It is important to note that p defines\nthe equilibrium constant K of the two phases, the free\nand the non-specifically bound protein, according to\nK\u2261\n\n(5)\n\nwhere hNcoll i is the average number of collisions in a simulation cycle and the second term accounts for the prime\ncollision (which is not observed in the simulations, since\nthe cycle starts at the time instant that immediately follows the prime collision). As will be shown later in Section 2.3, the recurrence time \u03c4R can be renormalized and\ncomputed efficiently inside a small test system. Note that\neq. (4) can be written as\n\nNE \u2261 hNcoll i \u2212\n\nwhere d is the shortest distance between walker and\nchain. This defines a pipe with radius rc around the\nchain contour that the walker is allowed to enter freely\nfrom outside, but to exit only with the probability\n\n(4)\n\nThis relation is useful for the numerical estimation of\n\u03c4BA if \u03c4BA \u226b \u03c4AB . A simulation cycle then starts in state\nA and ends as soon as state B is reached, i.e. the reversed\nreaction A \u2192 B is simulated in order to obtain the (much\nlower) reaction rate of the original reaction B \u2192 A. In\nthis case we can write\nN = hNcoll i + 1 ,\n\nof the cell. We want to point out that the parameter ra\ndoes not necessary correspond to any geometrical length\nin the real system. It defines a probability for the reaction to take place, and may cover additional variables\nwhich are not included explicitly in the model, like protein orientation and conformation. An attractive step\npotential is implemented as\n\u001a\n\u2212Eo d \u2264 rc\nU (d) =\n(8)\n0\nd > rc ,\n\n\u03c3\n\u03c0 rc2\n=\n,\nc\np\n\n(10)\n\nwhere c is the concentration of free proteins and \u03c3 =\nc Vc /(p L) is the linear density of proteins that are nonspecifically bound to the DNA, with Vc = \u03c0 rc2 L being\nthe geometric volume of the chain.\n2.3.\n\nMethod of computation of the recurrence time\n\nThe two states of interest are the protein entering the\ncell, B, and the same protein reaching the active site in\nthe center of the cell, A. More specifically, we are interested in finding the time \u03c4BA the walker requires to reach\na distance r = ra when starting at distance r(t = 0) = R.\nWe shall first define the excluded volume of the chain\nas\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\nZ \u0014\n\u2212U [d(r)]\n1\nVex \u2261\n1 \u2212 exp\ndr = Vc 1 \u2212\n,\nkB T\np\nV\n(11)\nwhere U (d) is the energy of the walker as defined by eq.\n(8) and the integration is performed over the geometric\nvolume of the cell, V = (4/3)\u03c0R3 . The effective volume\nVeff of the cell is then\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u22121 .\n(12)\nVeff \u2261 V \u2212 Vex = V + Vc\np\nNext we assume that simulations were carried out within\na small test system of radius R\u2217 < R and that the recurrence time \u03c4R\u2217 of the walker was found. Its recurrence\ntime in the larger system is then found as\n\u03c4R (V ) = \u03c4\u0303R Veff ,\n\n(13)\n\n\f3\nwhere we have defined\n\u03c4\u0303R \u2261\n\n\u03c4R\u2217\n\u2217 .\nVeff\n\n(14)\n\nThis ratio does not depend on system size and may therefore be called specific recurrence time. It only depends on\nthe potential-depth Eo and the step-size chosen for the\nrandom walk. The idea is to compute \u03c4\u0303R (as described\nin Section 4) for a small test system with dimensions\nof the order of ra (which is the radius of the specific\nbinding site) to obtain \u03c4R for the system of interest using eq. (13). Once \u03c4R is known, \u03c4AB is computed via\nrandom walk simulations in the large system, starting at\nr(t = 0) = ra and terminating as soon as the periphery of\nthe cell r(\u03c4AB ) = R is reached. Following the trajectory\nof the walker, the number of collisions hNcoll i = N \u2212 1 is\nmonitored as well, so that eq. (4) can be used to determine the much longer reaction time \u03c4BA .\n2.4.\n\nAnalytical estimate for the collision time\n\nAs has been discussed in detail elsewhere [8], it is possible to estimate the reaction time for the protein using an\nanalytical approach, once certain conditions are satisfied.\nThe resulting expression is\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nV\n2\n\u03c0L\u03be\nra\n\u03c4BA (\u03be) =\n1 \u2212 arctan\n+\n8D3d \u03be\n4D1d\n\u03c0\n\u03be\n(15)\nwith the 'sliding' variable\nr\nD1d K\n\u03be=\n(16)\n2\u03c0 D3d\nand D1d and D3d being the diffusion coefficients in\nsliding-mode and free diffusion, respectively. Generally,\nthe equilibrium constant K has to be determined in simulations of a (small) test system, containing a piece of\nchain without specific binding site [8]. In the present\nmodel, K is known analytically via eq. (10). If the stepsize dr of the random walker is equal both inside and\noutside the chain (the direction of the step being arbitrary), we further have D1d = D3d = dr2 /6, and hence\nobtain\ns\nrc2\n\u03be=\n.\n(17)\n2p\nThis variable has got the dimension of length; as we have\npointed out in [8], it corresponds to the average sliding\nlength of the protein along the DNA contour in Halford's\nmodel [7]. In this light, a (non rigorous) interpretation of\neq. (15) is as follows: The first term in the round brackets\nrepresents the time of free diffusion of the walker, whereas\nthe second term stands for the time of one-dimensional\nsliding. With increasing affinity of the walker to the chain\n(expressed as a reduced value for the exit probability p),\n\nthe sliding variable \u03be increases and the contribution of\nfree diffusion to the reaction time (first term in 15) becomes less significant. At the same time, the second term\nof eq. (15) is growing. Depending on the choice of system\nparameters, there may be a turning point where the latter contribution over-compensates the former, so that the\ntotal reaction time increases once \u03be is growing further.\nFor a random walk model as simple as used here,\nthis analytical formula describes the reaction times well\nwithin 10% tolerance, as long as the following conditions\nare satisfied: (1) \u03be \u226a R, i.e. the sliding parameter should\nbe small compared to the system size. This restriction\nassures the correct normalization of the protein's probability distributions and the diffusion efficiencies as discussed in [8]. (2) During the diffusion process, the system\nreaches its equilibrium, so that the constant K represents the average times the protein spends in free and\nin non-specifically bound mode. This requires either a\ncrowded environment (the chain-density inside the cell is\nhigh enough) or a reasonably small value for \u03be, since the\ninitial position of the walker is always at the periphery\nand outside the chain, i.e. not in equilibrium. (3) \u03be < lp ,\nwhere lp is the persistence length of the chain. This\nrestriction accounts for the assumption that the walker\nmoves along an approximately straight line during one\nsliding period. However, numerical tests have shown that\ndeviations from a straight geometry actually have little\nimpact to the accuracy of the model. (4) The step-size\nof the random walk has to be small compared to the size\nof the binding site.\nIt should be pointed out that an analytical approach\nas simple as that is by no means supposed to simulate\nthe actual situation in a living cell. Instead, it serves as\na platform for a much wider class of semi-empirical models. The sliding-parameter \u03be contains the affinity of nonspecific protein-DNA binding and is flexible to vary with\nthe potential chosen for the simulation. The diffusion coefficients D1d and D3d can be adapted to experimental\nmeasurements, and the target size ra contains proteinspecific reaction probabilities. These parameters can be\nfitted to either describe system-specific experimental results or the output of more sophisticated numerical codes\nwhich would otherwise not permit any analytical treatment.\n3.\n\nNUMERICAL MODEL\n\nIn order to approximate the real biological situation,\nthe DNA was modeled by a chain of straight segments of\nequal length l0 . Its mechanical stiffness was defined by\nthe bending energy associated with each chain joint:\nEb = kB T \u03b1 \u03b82 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b1 represents the dimensionless stiffness parameter, and \u03b8 the bending angle. The numerical value of \u03b1\ndefines the persistence length (lp ), i.e. the \"stiffness\" of\nthe chain. The excluded volume effect was taken into\n\n\f4\naccount by introducing the effective chain radius rc . The\nconformations of the chain, with distances between nonadjacent segments smaller than rc , were forbidden. The\ntarget of specific binding was assumed to lie exactly in\nthe middle of the DNA. The whole chain was packed in\na spherical volume (cell) of radius R in such a way that\nthe target occupied the central position.\nTo achieve a close packing of the chain inside the cell,\nwe used the following algorithm. First, a relaxed conformation of the free chain was produced by the standard\nMetropolis Monte-Carlo (MC) method. For the further\ncompression, we defined the center-norm (c-norm) as the\nmaximum distance from the target (the middle point) to\nthe other parts of the chain. Then, the MC procedure\nwas continued with one modification. Namely, a MC step\nwas rejected if the c-norm was exceeding 105% of the lowest value registered so far. The procedure was stopped\nwhen the desired degree of compaction was obtained.\nThe protein was modeled as a random walker within\nthe cell with reflecting boundaries. During one time-step\nit was displaced by the distance dr in a random direction. Once approaching the chain closer than its radius\nrc defining the \"non-specific binding pipe\", it was allowed to enter it freely and continue its random walk\ninside. Upon crossing the pipe boundary from inside, it\nwas either allowed to pass with the exit probability p or\notherwise reflected back inside, as described in Section\n2.2.\nBelow in this paper, one step dt was chosen as the unit\nof time and one persistence length lp = 50 nm of the\nDNA chain as the unit of distance. The following values\nof parameters were used. The length of one segment was\nchosen as l0 = 0.2, so that one persistence length was\npartitioned into 5 segments. The corresponding value of\nthe stiffness parameter was \u03b1 = 2.403 [10]. The chain\nradius was rc = 0.06, and the active site was modeled as\na sphere of identical radius ra = 0.06 embedded into the\nchain. The step-size of the random walker both inside\nand outside the chain was dr = 0.02, corresponding to\na diffusion coefficient D3d = D1d = dr2 /6 = 2 * 10\u22124 /3.\nThis choice was a compromise between accuracy and simulation time. Tests have confirmed that a smaller stepsize could somewhat reduce the gap between theoretical\n(eq. 15) and simulated reaction time at small values of \u03be.\n\n4.\n\nCOMPUTATION OF THE SPECIFIC\nRECURRENCE TIME\n\nTo compute the specific recurrence time \u03c4\u0303R of eq. (14),\na very small test system is sufficient. Moreover, the computations can be carried out for the collisions from within\nthe specific binding site of radius ra [9]. The entire system, i.e. the sphere and a short piece of chain, was embedded into a cube of 4ra side-length with reflective walls.\nIn principle, the size of the cube should be of no relevance, but it was found that, if chosen too small, effects\nof the finite step-size were emerging. The walker started\n\ninside the sphere. Each time upon leaving the spherical\nvolume a collision was noted. If the walker was about to\nexit the cylindrical volume of the chain, it was reflected\nback inside with the probability 1 \u2212 p. The clock was\nhalted as long as the walker moved outside the sphere\nand only counted time-steps inside the sphere. Since the\nbinding site was embedded into the chain, its effective\nvolume (eq. 12) was simply Veff = Va /p, with Va being\nthe volume of the specific binding site.\nTable I contains the results for 12 different values of the\nexit probability p. The recurrence time \u03c4R\u2217 does in fact\ndepend on p, although the spherical volume Va is fully\nembedded into the chain. The reason is that within one\ntime-step, the walker may leave the sphere, but, depending on p, subsequently reflected back from the chain's\nperiphery into the binding site. Such a move is not accounted as a collision (there are no fractional time-steps).\nThe computational cost of these simulations is negligible\n- Millions of cycles are carried out within minutes on a\nPC, and the statistical error of \u03c4\u0303R can be made negligibly\nsmall.\n\n5.\n\nMODEL SYSTEMS OF VARIOUS SIZES\n\nNext, simulations were carried out for cells of different\nvolumes Vi = 4\u03c0 Ri3 /3 (see table II for a summary of the\nsystem parameters). The chain lengths Li were chosen so\nthat the density Li /Vi remained of the same order around\n3/4. First, the chain conformation was generated using\nthe procedure of Section 3. Then, each simulation cycle\nstarted at the periphery of the active binding site (state\nA) and ended as soon as the periphery of the cell (state\n\nTABLE I: Recurrence time (3rd column) inside the spherical\nbinding site (R = ra ), specific recurrence time eq.

The chain was made of 1729 segments.\nThe protein's specific binding site is located at the center (dot,\nnot to scale).\n\nB) was reached. Whenever the walker returned back to\nthe binding site (r < ra ), one collision was noted. As\nlong as the walker remained inside the binding site, the\nclock was halted. For each value of the exit parameter p,\nwhich is related to the walker-chain affinity via eq. (9),\n2000 cycles were carried out and the measurements were\naveraged, so that statistical fluctuations were reduced to\nabout 2%. The simulations provided measurements of\n\u03c4AB , the average time to reach B when starting from\nA, and hNcoll i, the number of returns to A on the way\ntowards B. Equations (13) and (4), which form the core\nof the MEC approach, were then applied to evaluate \u03c4BA .\nAdditionally, \u03c4BA was simulated explicitly, starting from\nB, as a verification of the speed-up and accuracy of the\nMEC approach. The results are summarized in table II.\nIn order to clarify the procedure, we shall first discuss\nthe simulation of the largest cell R = 4.8 in more detail.\nFigure 1 displays the chain conformation inside the\nspherical cell in a 2-dimensional projection. The specific\nbinding site is located at the center of the cell. Note that,\nwherever possible, the chain contour, constructed of 1729\ncylindrical segments, tries to avoid large bond angles, a\nresult of the bending potential as discussed in Section 3.\nTable I contains details of the simulation results for 12\ndifferent values of the exit parameter p, varied as p = 2\u2212l ,\nl = 0, . . . , 11.

The next column is the\nnumber of collisions N (eq. 5). The more time it spends\ninside the chain contour, i.e. with increasing influence of\nfacilitated diffusion, the more often the walker returns\nback to state A to cause a collision, before being able to\nreach state B for the first time to finish the cycle. From\np = 1 (free diffusion) to p = 2\u221211 , the value of N gains\nalmost two orders of magnitude. The next column is the\naverage reaction time \u03c4AB of the direction A \u2192 B. This\nquantity initially remains almost constant, but at higher\nvalues of protein-chain affinity it begins to grow rapidly.\nThe reason is because the walker becomes more and more\ntrapped inside the chain volume and is unable to access\nthe cell periphery as effectively as it does during free\ndiffusion. The next column is the reaction time \u03c4BA of\nthe reaction B \u2192 A as delivered by the MEC approach\nusing eq. (4). The recurrence time \u03c4R was determined\nusing eq. (13), with the effective volume of eq. (12) and\nthe specific recurrence time \u03c4\u0303R (column 4). The next\ncolumn contains \u03c4BA as obtained by direct simulations.\nWhen averaged over all data points, both results for \u03c4BA\ndiffered by 2.4%. As shown in the last column, the ratio\n\u03c4BA /\u03c4AB was of the order 10-100. This defines the speedup of the MEC approach over the explicit simulation of\n\u03c4BA . Integrated over all data points, the total speed-up\nwas equal to 33.4.\n\n\f6\nFigure 2 displays the first reaction times \u03c4BA as a function of the sliding parameter \u03be. Both methods (explicit\nsimulation and MEC approach) deliver identical results\nwithin the statistical errors. The solid curve is a plot\nof the analytical estimate eq. (15), which consistently\nunder-estimates the first reaction time by 5-10% but otherwise describes the trends accurately, including the location of the minimum. The results prove that facilitated diffusion is able to accelerate the reaction considerably. It is also obvious that a very high affinity of the\nprotein to the chain becomes counter-productive: The\nwalker spends long periods of time trapped within a particular loop of the chain without being able to explore\nthe remaining parts of the cell exhaustively. Ideally, the\naffinity has to be chosen so that the walker is occasionally\nable to dissociate from the chain and associate again after having passed some time in free diffusion. The actual\nvalue of the ideal affinity depends on the system parameters and is easily estimated using eq. (15) prior to any\nsimulations.\nTable II contains a summary of the simulation results\nfor various system sizes. It appears that the speed-up\ndelivered by the MEC approach increased proportional\nto the square of the cell radius, and gained a significant\ndimension in the largest of our test systems. Whereas a\ncell as small as R = 1.2 was treated within 30 minutes on\na PC, including 2000 runs of explicit simulation B \u2192 A\nfor 12 different values of the exit probability p, the large\ncell of R = 4.8 required more than 5 days for the same set\nof computations. The MEC method reduced that time\nto less than four hours.\n\nTABLE II: Simulation parameters (cell radius R, chain length\nL) and total speed-up.

We have demonstrated how MEC led to a speed-up of up to two orders of\nmagnitude, depending on protein-DNA affinity (Table I),\nand gaining significance with increasing cell size (Table\nII).\n\nIn this work, the method of excess-collisions (MEC),\nrecently introduced as a technique to speed up the simulation of intramolecular reactions in polymers, is generalized to second order diffusion controlled reactions,\nand applied to the problem of facilitated diffusion of sitespecific DNA-binding proteins. This method is based on\neq. (4) and (13) to simulate the much faster back-reaction\n\nThe cell model employed in this work was perhaps the\nmost simple ansatz that was possible without being trivial, and intentionally so. The simulations had to cover\na large range of system sizes in order to verify the efficiency of the MEC approach. The chain-lengths span\na factor of 64 from the smallest to the largest system.\nNevertheless, the validity of our results does not depend\non the complexity of the model, such as protein-DNA\npotential, which modifies the equilibrium constant K in\neq. (10) and thereby the sliding parameter \u03be (eq. 16),\nhydrodynamic interactions, which would lead to effective\ndiffusion coefficients, also modifying \u03be, or the introduction of protein orientation and conformation, acting on\nthe effective target size ra . The speed-up is consistently\nevaluated in terms of simulation steps, not CPU-time,\nto ensure invariance on the complexity of the underlying protein/DNA model. Based on the results presented\nhere, the MEC approach can be expected to reduce the\nnumerical effort by orders of magnitude, once more sophisticated (and time consuming) simulation techniques\nare employed to study biochemical reaction times in systems of realistic dimensions.\n\n[1] A.D.
