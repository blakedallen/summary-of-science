Introduction\nThe emission processes responsible for the spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of large-scale quasar\njets, constructed using Spitzer, HST and Chandra\ndata, are the subject of active debate.1 The X-ray\nintensity relative to the radio synchrotron flux is\ngenerally too high to be explained by synchrotronself-Compton.2 The SED at radio, optical, and X-ray\ntraces an inflected shape, which disfavors the interpretation of X-rays as due to synchrotron radiation\nfrom a single population of electrons.\nInverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons by high-energy electrons (with electron Lorentz\nfactor of \u03b3e \u223c 30) in a highly relativistic jet with bulk\nLorentz factor \u0393 \u223c 10 initially seemed an attractive\nway to explain the observed X-ray emission,3,4 but\nthis process is also not free of problems.5 Finally, the\nX-rays may arise from synchrotron radiation from\nextremely energetic protons.6 Determining which of\nthese emission mechanisms produces the observed Xray jets in powerful quasars is a strong motivation for\nmore observations of radio-loud quasars, and has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of known\nX-ray jets.\nIn this work, we highlight new results based on\nthe multiwavelength data from the VLA, Hubble,\nSpitzer and Chandra, aiming at identifying the radiation mechanisms operating in powerful quasar jets.\nThe jets in the nearest quasar 3C 273 (z = 0.158)\nand in the lobe-dominated quasar PKS 1136\u2212135\n\n(z = 0.554) are selected for our detailed analysis.\n\n2. Quasar Jets in 3C 273 and\nPKS 1136\u2212135\n2.1. Image\nFigure 1 (from Ref. 7) presents a three-color image of\nthe large-scale jet in 3C 273 made with Spitzer, HST,\nand Chandra (with the VLA contours overlaid). The\nSpitzer photometry at 3.6 \u03bcm is illustrated as a series of best-fitted PSFs of every knot to restore a\nresolution similar to the X-rays. The HST image represents an \"UV excess\" map emphasizing the nearultraviolet light. The inner knots (A\u2013B3) closer to\nthe quasar core are bright in both the UV excess and\nX-rays, while the outer knots (C2\u2013H3) are bright in\nthe mid-infrared. Recent far UV imaging at 150 nm\nwith HST indeed confirmed that the inner knots are\nbright in UV.9\nIn Fig. 1 we also present a three-color multifrequency image of the jet in quasar PKS 1136\u2212135\n(from Ref. 8). At the positions of optically bright\nknots A and B we depict a dot to indicate secure detections with HST .10 The brightness patterns along\nthe jet in various bands appear to be broadly similar\nto the 3C 273 jet. Like 3C 273, the jet knots can be\ndivided up into two parts: the inner knots (A and B)\nand the outer knots (C, D, and E). The inner knots\nare bright in both the optical and X-rays, and as such\nthey are high-energy dominated.\n\n\fDecember 5, 2018\n\n13:23\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 11in x 8.5in\n\nmain\n\n2\n\n2.2. SED\n\nFig. 1. (Top) Spitzer -HST -Chandra composite image of the\njet in 3C 273 (Ref. 7): Spitzer \"reconstructed\" 3.6 \u03bcm (red),\nHST \"UV excess\" (green), and Chandra 0.4\u20136 keV (blue).\nThe VLA 2 cm radio contours are superposed on the image,\nwith the strongest radio source H2 being truncated. (Bottom) Composite image of the jet in PKS 1136\u2212135 (Ref. 8):\nSpitzer (red), HST (green dots on knots A and B), and Chandra (blue). The superposed contours are from the VLA 8.5\nGHz. Knot A is closest to the quasar core in both cases.\n\nIn Fig. 2, the SEDs of both the quasar core and the\njet in 3C 273 are shown. The fluxes of the quasar\ncore, originated in a small-scale jet and an accretion disk of the central supermassive black hole, are\ndescribed in Ref. 11. The jet SED is a \"summed\"\nspectrum for all the knots in Fig. 1 (Refs. 7,9,12).\nHere, we added new (unpublished) data points at\n4.8, 8.0 and 24 \u03bcm in the infrared using the Spitzer\nIRAC and MIPS. A very wide band from mid IR (24\n\u03bcm) to far UV (0.15 \u03bcm) is covered with HST and\nSpitzer, revealing a spectral character of quasar jets\nwith unprecedented details.\nWe compare SEDs of the large-scale jets in\n3C 273 and PKS 1136\u2212135 in Fig. 3. The two SEDs\nshare common features. The optical and UV fluxes\nof the jet have a clear excess over the extrapolation from the infrared wavelengths, indicating that\ntwo spectral components cross over at optical wavelengths. We identify two spectral components as follows: (1) the low-energy (LE) synchrotron spectrum\nextending from radio to infrared with a spectral cutoff at \u223c 5 \u00d7 1013 Hz, and (2) the high-energy (HE)\ncomponent arising in the optical and smoothly connecting to the X-ray flux. The two-component nature of the jet SED becomes more apparent if we\nconstruct knot-by-knot SEDs (see Refs. 7,9). Each\nSED shows the two components with varying relative strengths such that the low-energy part becomes more dominant with increasing distance from\nthe quasar core. The position of the spectral cutoff\nof the LE component seems similar from one knot to\nanother. Interestingly, in 3C 273, the spectral slopes\nof the HE component change from \u03b1HE \u2243 0.7 (inner\nknots) to \u03b1HE \u2243 1.0 (outer knots).\n3. Discussion\n3.1. LE component\n\nFig. 2. Broadband SEDs of the core and large-scale jet in\n3C 273. The quasar core (open circles) shows synchrotron and\nIC components of the small-scale jet as well as an accretion\ndisk component in the optical.11 The large-scale jet (accumulated over the entire length from knot A to H1) shows two\ncomponents. The curves represent synchrotron radiation in\nthe radio\u2013infrared and its IC counterpart in gamma-rays: for\na jet Doppler factor of \u03b4 = 4 (solid curves) and \u03b4 = 8 (dashed\ncurves).\n\nLet us deduce some physical parameters of the LE\nspectral component, which is synchrotron radiation\nby relativistic electrons in the jet. The observed jet\nradiation is enhanced by Doppler beaming. (The\nDoppler factor is defined as \u03b4 \u2261 [\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)]\u22121\nwith \u03b2c the velocity of the jet, \u0393 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22121/2 the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the jet, and \u03b8 the observing\nangle with respect to the jet direction.)\nThe LE synchrotron emission has a high-energy\ncutoff at \u03bdc \u2243 5 \u00d7 1013 Hz, presumably associated\n\n\fDecember 5, 2018\n\n13:23\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 11in x 8.5in\n\nmain\n\n3\n\nwith the maximum energy of the electron population.\nThe maximum energy can be deduced as Emax \u223c\n0.2 (B\u22124 \u03b4)\u22120.5 TeV, where B\u22124 = B/(0.1 mG) is\nthe comoving magnetic field strength. The equipartition magnetic field is B\u03b4 \u223c 0.1 mG for 3C 273 and\nB\u03b4 \u223c 0.7 mG for PKS 1136\u2212135.\n\nFig. 3. SEDs of the large-scale jets in 3C 273 (taken from\nFig. 2) and PKS 1136\u2212135 (black filled circles: Ref. 8). The\njet in PKS 1136\u2212135 (fluxes extracted from knots A to E) has\na two-component SED similar to 3C 273. The curves represent\nsynchrotron radiation models.\n\nBy extrapolating VLA radio flux of knot H1/H2\nin 3C 273 to lower frequencies (10\u2013100 MHz), we\nfound that a low energy \"cutoff\" or \"break\" should\nbe present as well. Otherwise, the jet radio flux\naround \u223c 100 MHz exceeds even the total radio flux\nof 3C 273. It would be reasonable to assume that such\na cutoff/break is common to all the knots. We adopt\nEmin \u223c 1000mec2 in Fig. 2 to introduce the low energy cutoff. Also, the observed synchrotron spectra\nfrom the radio to optical frequencies are likely to be\nformed in a \"cooling regime\", and therefore a cooling\nbreak may appear in low-frequency radio bands.\nUsing the relation sLE = 2\u03b1LE , where sLE is acceleration index, the observed index of \u03b1LE \u2243 0.7\nis translated into the electron acceleration index of\nsLE \u2243 1.4, close to the hardest possible index (s =\n1.5) in the nonlinear shock acceleration theory. Here\nwe assumed particle acceleration taking place in each\nknot, where relativistic electrons are accumulated\nover a certain timescale of 105 to 107 yr. Assuming\nthat the number of radio-emitting electrons is balanced by the number of cold protons in the jet, we estimated a jet kinetic power of Lkin \u223c 5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121\n\nwith \u03b4 = \u0393 = 4 and the equipartition magnetic field.\n3.2. HE component: IC/CMB or\nsynchrotron?\nThe beamed IC scenario3,4 was initially considered to\nbe an attractive explanation of the X-ray-dominated\ncomponent of the SED for jet knots in radio-loud\nquasars, like 3C 273 (Ref. 13) and PKS 1136\u2212135\n(Refs. 10,14). We argued for a direct connection between the optical and X-ray fluxes.7 The same mechanism should be responsible for the optical and X-ray\nemissions. If one adopts the beamed IC model for the\nX-rays, the energy distribution of electrons has to\ncontinue down to very low energies of Emin \u223c me c2\nto account for the optical emission.\nIn the framework of the beamed IC radiation, it\nis interesting to note that the jet exhibits the evolution of multiwavelength emission along the jet as\nshown in Fig. 1. The increase of radio brightness\nis accompanied by the decrease of X-ray brightness\ntowards downstream, which can be understood in\nterms of deceleration of the jet.10,14,15 If the beamed\nIC scenario is correct, we are able to study the flow\nstructure of the large-scale jets.\nNew results indicate, however, that the beamed\nIC scenario faces several difficulties. First, in the\nouter knots of the 3C 273 jet, the radio spectral index of \u03b1LE \u2243 0.7 disagrees with the HE spectral\nindex of \u03b1HE \u2243 1.0 (see Refs. 7,12). Second, the parameters required in the beamed IC/CMB model are\noften too extreme. In the case of 3C 273, we obtained\na Doppler factor of \u03b4 = 30 for knot A and a jet kinetic power of Lkin \u2243 1 \u00d7 1048 erg s\u22121 . The obtained\nDoppler factor seems too large for 3C 273, since relatively large contributions from the un-beamed components are observed in the core emission (see Fig. 2)\nand accretion-disk emission appears to be comparable to the jet emission in the X-ray regime.16 In the\ncase of PKS 1136\u2212135, we obtained a Doppler factor\nof \u03b4 = 19, which is also difficult to reconcile with the\nlobe-dominated nature of the quasar.\nInstead of the beamed IC, synchrotron radiation\nby a second population of high-energy electrons may\naccount for the HE component. Then the spectral index of the HE component, \u03b1HE \u2243 0.5\u20131.0 in 3C 273\nand PKS 1136\u2212135, corresponds to sHE \u2243 1.0\u20132.0.\nHowever, sHE \u2243 1.0 would be incompatible with\ndiffusive shock acceleration theory. This brings into\nquestion the idea that the second electron population\n\n\fDecember 5, 2018\n\n13:23\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 11in x 8.5in\n\nmain\n\n4\n\nis accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration.\nThe second synchrotron component may instead be\ndue to turbulent acceleration operating in the shear\nlayers.17 Unlike the shock acceleration, a hard spectrum, s < 1.5, can be expected to form in the case of\nturbulent acceleration (i.e., second-order Fermi acceleration). This scenario should be tested by future\nTeV observations (see below).\n\nof the jet was done but with the pre-COSTAR FOC\nand low significances.19 Recently, HST polarimetry\nof PKS 1136\u2212135 has been approved (PI: Eric Perlman). New polarimetry of quasar jets on large-scales\nwill provide important clues as to the origin of the\nHE component.\n\n3.3. GLAST (Fermi-LAT) observations\nAs detailed in Ref. 18, GLAST measurements of the\nquasar jets will provide us with new information (or\nconstraints) about the jet emission. The infraredemitting electrons in a relativistic jet inevitably emit\nGeV \u03b3-rays through an IC/CMB process (see Fig. 2).\nThe total radiative output is dominated by the multiGeV \u03b3-rays and their predicted flux with \u03b4 \u223c 7\nexceeds the 1-yr sensitivity offered by the GLAST\nLAT in the case of 3C 273. Also, the observations\nof PKS 1136\u2212135 with GLAST may be able to test\nthe IC/CMB hypothesis, since the beamed IC model\nwith \u03b4 \u223c 20 predicts the observable GeV flux.8 Note\nthat steadiness and hard spectrum can distinguish\nthe large-scale emission from the core emission.\nMoreover, if the HE fluxes are due to synchrotron\nradiation by electrons, the UV/X-ray-emitting electrons in a relativistic jet produce IC-upscattered TeV\n\u03b3-rays. This offers a potential diagnostic tool to distinguish the origin of the HE component.\n3.4. HST polarimetry\nFinally we emphasize that optical polarimetry can\nbe an effective way of discriminating the radiation\nmodels responsible for the optical-to-X-ray emission\nof the jets. In the beamed IC interpretation, the optical and X-ray emission are due to Compton upscattering off the amplified CMB by high-energy electrons of \u03b3e \u223c 3 (optical) and \u03b3e \u223c 100 (X-ray). Unlike in the case of synchrotron models, the X-rays\nare expected to be unpolarized and the optical light is\nnearly unpolarized at most a few percent of polarization (see Fig. 4). Precise polarization measurements\nin the optical can in principle verify (or discard) the\nbeamed IC model. Unfortunately, there have been no\nuseful polarization observations of quasar jets with\nHST so far. Only for 3C 273, early HST polarimetry\n\nFig. 4. The polarization degree in the synchrotron+IC model\nof knot A in the 3C 273 jet. The Doppler and Lorentz factor of a jet are \u03b4 = \u0393 = 15.
