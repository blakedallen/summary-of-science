Introduction\nThe evolution of the dust in a protoplanetary disk is one of the\nkey subjects in the overall research on mechanisms of planet\nformation. As we now know, dust in young circumstellar disks\ndiffers significantly from the dust in the interstellar medium\n(ISM). There is evidence for grain growth from the typical ISM\nand sedimentation in the vertical direction (or dust settling) of\na disk (see various references such as Rodmann et al. 2006,\nSicilia-Aguilar et al. 2007, Furlan et al. 2006). While the dust\ngrains in the ISM and in molecular clouds are amorphous, protoplanetary disks contain an increased content of crystalline silicates (Bouwman et al. 2008). This transition of the dust grain\nstructure during the star-forming process is poorly understood\nand could be important in the later scenario of planet formation.\nHowever, as many authors have pointed out (e.g.\nWatson et al. 2009, Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2007, van Boekel et al.\n2005, Schegerer et al. 2006), no definitive connection have\nbeen found so far between the properties of the disk or of the\ncentral object and the crystalline mass fraction of the dust disk.\nFrom the point of view of standard dust processing scenarios\nfor protoplanetary disks, this conclusion is surprising. We\nexpect the crystallization of the dust grains to occur due to\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nglauser@astro.phys.ethz.ch\n\nA.\n\nM.\n\nGlauser,\n\ne-mail:\n\nthermal annealing or evaporation and recondensation processes\neither close to the star or within accretion shocks (Henning\n2008). Radial mixing may transport the crystalline grains to\nmore distant regions (e.g., Gail 2004). Therefore, we expect\nan evolutionary trend for the crystalline mass fraction and/or\ncorrelations with stellar parameters such as the bolometric\nluminosity, the photospheric temperature, the accretion rate or\nthe disk/star mass ratio. The fact that no such relation has been\nfound raises the question on alternative mechanisms, controlling\nthe process of crystallization. Kessler-Silacci et al. (2006) and\nWatson et al. (2009) suggested that the crystallizing process\nmight be dominated by the impact of X-ray irradiation which\ndestroys the crystalline structure of the dust grains.\nYoung stars are very strong sources of X-rays. A typical\nT Tauri star emits between 1029 and 1031 erg s\u22121 in the soft\n(0.1 \u2212 10 keV) X-ray band, i.e., 2 \u2212 4 orders of magnitude more\nthan the Sun (see G\u00fcdel 2004 for a review of stellar X-ray radiation). The radiation is thought to be mostly coronal, originating\nfrom hot (1 \u2212 20 million K), magnetically trapped plasma above\nthe stellar photosphere, in analogy to the solar coronal X-ray radiation.\nThere is little doubt that X-rays have some impact on the\ngas and dust in circumstellar disks, at least relatively close to\nthe star and at the disk surface. For example, Igea & Glassgold\n(1999), Glassgold et al. (2004) or Ercolano et al. (2008) com-\n\n\f2\n\nA. M. Glauser et al.: Dust amorphization in protoplanetary disks\n\nputed detailed models for radial distances between 0.5-10 AU\nthat indicate efficient ionization of circumstellar disks by Xrays and also heating of the gaseous surface layers to several\nthousands of Kelvin. Complicated chemical networks are a consequence (e.g., Semenov et al. 2004 or Ilgner & Nelson 2006).\nA direct evidence for these processes is suggested from the\npresence of strong line radiation of [Ne ii] at 12.8 \u03bcm detected\nby Spitzer in many T Tauri stars (e.g., Pascucci et al. 2007,\nHerczeg et al. 2007 or Lahuis et al. 2007) which in some cases\nmay be triggered by shocks (van Boekel et al. 2009). This transition requires ionization and heating of the ambient gas to several\n1000 K (Glassgold et al. 2007).\nMagnetic energy release events, so-called flares, occurring\nin the same stellar coronae can increase the X-ray output up to\nhundreds of times, but as we know from solar observations, such\nevents are also accompanied by high-energy electrons, protons\nand ions ejected from the Sun. Feigelson et al. (2002) speculated\nthat the expected elevated proton flux around T Tauri stars leads\nto isotopic anomalies in solids in the accretion disk, as suggested\nfrom measurements of meteoritic composition for our early solar\nsystem (Caffe et al. 1987).\nThe destructive impact of high-energy irradiation on crystalline structures by ions has been demonstrated in laboratory\nmeasurements by, e.g., J\u00e4ger et al. (2003), Bringa et al. (2007),\nDemyk et al. (2001), Carrez et al. (2002), mainly for low energetic cosmic rays (E >\n\u223c50 keV) but rarely also for lower energies\ntypical of stellar winds.\nIn this study we look in particular for correlations between\nthe crystalline mass fraction and stellar properties related to Xray emission by deriving these parameters for T Tauri stars in the\nTaurus-Auriga star formation region. We present in Sect. 2 the\ntarget sample and some aspects of the data reduction, describe\nin Sect. 3 the methodology of measuring the crystalline mass\nfraction based on decomposition fits to the 10 \u03bcm silicate feature,\npresent the derived values in Sect. 4 and bring them into context\nwith X-ray parameters in Sect. 5. Our conclusions are presented\nin Sect. 6.\n\nTable 1.

Data sample and data reduction\nWe use the sample of objects in common to two recent surveys of\nthe Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. The first survey was obtained by the Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) and was published previously by Furlan et al. (2006) and further analyzed by\nWatson et al. (2009). The second survey was performed in the\nX-ray range with XMM-Newton as described by G\u00fcdel et al.\n(2007). While the former survey provides information on the\ndust properties of the circumstellar disks, the latter allows the\ninvestigation of stellar X-rays. We focus only on the disk surrounded (Class II, as listed in G\u00fcdel et al. 2007) T Tauri stars\nwhich appear in both surveys and show significant emission in\nthe 10 \u03bcm silicate feature.

This allows to measure the relative contribution\nof different energy bands to the X-ray radiation; the hard and\nsoft bands comprise the 1 \u2212 10 keV and the 0.3 \u2212 1 keV ranges,\nrespectively:\nH=\n\nLX (1 keV < E < 10 keV)\nLX (0.3 keV < E < 1 keV)\n\n.\n\n3\n\n3. The decomposition of the 10 \u03bcm silicate feature\n3.1. Modeling of the Emission Profile\n\nOur model describes the total observable flux with three components based on the two-layer temperature distribution (TLTD)\nmethod introduced by Juhasz et al. (2009): The emission from\nthe stellar photosphere, a continuum emission from the opaque\ndisk midplane and emission from the optically thin disk atmosphere consisting of thermal emission from dust grains of different mineralogy and temperature. The atmosphere is transparent\nwith respect to the continuum emission of the disk midplane.\nFigure 1 shows a sketch of the disk model.\n\n(3)\n\nAs a few objects such as DH Tau showed excessive emission\nduring the observation (as described by Telleschi et al. 2007),\ntheir value for LX does not correspond to the actual averaged luminosity which is the parameter of interest for the present study.\nTherefore, these objects have been discarded from our sample.\nThe last column of Table 1 lists the stellar age (from\nG\u00fcdel et al. 2007). These values were derived from T eff and L\u2217 as\ngiven in the literature and provide best-estimate values for which\nsystematic uncertainties are difficult to provide. Although G\u00fcdel\net al. indicated conservative age uncertainties (based on a variety\nof literature values for T eff and L\u2217 ) of factors of 2\u20133, these are\nextreme values, and most ages are - within the framework of one\nset of evolutionary tracks (Siess et al. 2000 in G\u00fcdel et al. 2007)\n- much more narrowly confined. As for the original parameters\nused for age determination, T eff and L\u2217 , White & Ghez (2001)\n(used in the XEST study) estimate uncertainties in L\u2217 of 0.1\u2013\n0.3 dex for their sample. Hartigan & Kenyon (2003) (also used\nin the XEST study) estimate errors in L\u2217 from the disagreement\nof ages between components of binaries, amounting to typically\n0.1\u20130.2 dex. A similar uncertainty (0.11 dex) for L\u2217 has also\nbeen given by Kenyon & Hartmann (1995). A scatter of 0.2-0.3\ndex is furthermore found when comparing values from various\nauthors. We thus conclude that most of our ages (primarily determined by L\u2217 and much less by T eff ) are accurate to within a\nfactor of 1.5\u20132.\nThe range of the stellar ages spreads from 0.5 to 10 Myr.\nAlthough our sample consists of Class II T Tauri stars only, this\nwide range indicates that the selected objects can be categorized\ninto three evolutionary groups: Very young objects (.1 Myr)\nwhich are likely to be in a transitional phase from embedded\nto disk-only geometries; typical Class II objects with a pure\ndisk geometry; and older objects (&5 Myr) which are more mature Class II sources and are likely to have changed characteristics compared to their younger counterparts. These groups are\nnot separated sharply given the age uncertainties. Also, we note\nthat age is not the only parameter determining the evolutionary\nstate of the disk. Therefore we continue to study the full sample\nand will investigate the object selection later in this paper (see\nSect. 5.2).\n\nFig. 1. Circumstellar disk model describing the observable total\nflux which is a superposition of the stellar light, F\u22c6 , the continuum emission from the disk midplane, Fmid , and the emission\nfrom the optically thin disk atmosphere, Fatm .\n\nThe total observable flux is given by\nF\u03bd,tot = F\u03bd,\u22c6 + F\u03bd,mid + F\u03bd,atm\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nWe describe the flux of the stellar photosphere approximately\nwith the emission of a blackbody with a temperature T \u22c6 :\n2h\u03bd3\n1\n\u2261 C\u22c6 * B\u03bd(T \u22c6 ) .\n(5)\nc2 eh\u03bd/kT \u22c6 \u2212 1\nC\u22c6 is the normalization factor used for the later fit and B\u03bd (T )\ndefines the Planck function at temperature T . To model the flux\nfrom the midplane and the atmosphere of the disk, we set up two\nsimple continuum emission profiles, one of which we use directly for the midplane while the other is multiplied by dust grain\nabsorption coefficients \u03ba\u03bd,i for modeling the flux from the atmosphere. These two continuum emission profiles are constructed\nas a superposition of blackbody spectra taking a radial temperature distribution T (r) and geometrical aspects of the disk into\naccount, assuming axisymmetry. Hence, the fluxes can be written as\nZ Rmid,out\n \u0303\nB\u03bd(T mid (r)) * r * r.\n(6)\nF\u03bd,mid = C0 *\nF\u03bd,\u22c6 = C\u22c6\n\nRmid,in\n\nF\u03bd,atm =\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nC\u0303i * \u03ba\u03bd,i *\n\nZ\n\nRatm,out\n\nRatm,in\n\nB\u03bd (T atm (r)) * r * r.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere r is the radial distance to the central object, Ratm/mid,in/out\nthe inner and outer radii of the disk midplane and atmosphere,\n\n\f4\n\nA. M. Glauser et al.: Dust amorphization in protoplanetary disks\n\nrespectively (see Fig. 1), C\u0303i are the normalization factors of the\nN dust species i (in our case we use N = 10, see Sect. 3.2) and\nC \u03030 of the disk midplane emission, respectively. We assume the\ntemperature distributions to follow a simple power law with\n!qmid\nT mid (r)\nr\n=\n(8)\nT mid,max\nRmid,in\n!qatm\nT atm (r)\nr\n=\n(9)\nT atm,max\nRatm,in\nwhich implies that all grains in the atmosphere or in the disk\nmid-plane follow the same temperature profile, regardless their\nsize and chemical composition. This allows a substitution of r\nwith T and Eqs. (6) and (7) can be rewritten as\nZ T mid,min\nC0\nF\u03bd,mid =\nB\u03bd (T ) * T (2\u2212qmid )/qmid T.\n(10)\n*\nqmid\nT mid,max\nZ T atm,min\nN\nX\nCi * \u03ba\u03bd,i\n*\nB\u03bd (T ) * T (2\u2212qatm )/qatm T.\n(11)\nF\u03bd,atm =\nq\natm\nT\natm,max\ni=1\nwhere Ci are the new normalization factors used for the later fit.\nIn this fitting approach, C\u22c6 ,C0 , . . ., C N , qmid , qatm , T \u22c6 , T mid,max ,\nT mid,min , T atm,max and T atm,min are fitting parameters. As we are\nonly interested in a wavelength range between \u223c7 \u03bcm and 14 \u03bcm\n(see Sect. 5.1 for a discussion), we can eliminate several of these\nparameters:\n\u2013 T \u22c6 can be derived from the literature. We used the values\nsummarized in Table 1.\n\u2013 We chose to set T mid,min and T atm,min to 10 K to account for\nthe contribution of the cooler region of the disk which is irrelevant for the mid-infrared regime.\n\u2013 Figure 2 shows the impact of T mid,max on the shape of the flux\nfunction given by Eq. (10) by keeping qmid constant. It is ob-\n\nof generality T mid,max = 1800 K. With the same argumentation we set T atm,max = 1800 K.\n\u2013 First trials of fitting simulated spectra showed that the fit\nis not sensitive to qatm for any physically meaningful value\n(e.g., 0 \u2265 qatm \u2265 \u22122) as the influence on the shape of the flux\nfunction in Eq. (11) is fully dominated by the dust emission\nprofile. We therefore set qatm = qmid \u2261 q.\nConsequently, the remaining fit parameters are C\u22c6 , C0 , . . ., C N\nand q. For a given q and more than N + 2 data points, C\u22c6 , C0 ,\n. . ., C N can be derived analytically according to a non-negative\nleast-square fit (see e.g. Lawson & Hanson 1974) and further, a\nunique solution exists. Therefore, we can search efficiently for a\nglobal minimum of \u03c72 (q).\nTo derive the components Ci and q of the fit function and\ntheir errors for a given observation, we compute 100 spectra\nadding Monte-Carlo simulated, normally distributed noise to the\noriginal data; the noise distribution is based on the spectral errors of the original data. Each of these spectra is then fitted with a\nleast-square method approach as we take the median values (the\ndistributions tend to be very asymmetric) of the resulting parameters to obtain the final parameters and their errors (1\u03c3 range of\nthe frequency distribution).\n3.2. Emission profiles\n\nWe use emission profiles analogous to Schegerer et al. (2006)\nand Bouwman et al. (2008): For the amorphous silicates we\nuse profiles calculated for homogeneous, compact, and spherical grains applying Mie theory. For the crystalline silicates we\nuse emission profiles calculated for inhomogeneous spheres according to the distribution of hollow spheres (DHS, Min et al.\n2005). We start from the complex refractive indices ni for silicate material i. The result is the dimensionless absorption efficiency Qi , which is used for calculating the mass absorption\ncoefficient \u03bam,i = Qi \u03c0a2 /(4/3\u03c0a3\u03c1) where a is the particle radius and \u03c1 the material density. We fit the 10 \u03bcm silicate feature with amorphous silicates with the stoichiometries of olivine\n(MgFeSiO4 ) and pyroxene (MgFe[SiO3 ]2 ) and the crystalline\nsilicates forsterite (Mg2 SiO4 ), enstatite (MgSiO3 ) and quartz\n(SiO2 ). Table 2 summarizes the dust species considered here.\n\nTable 2.

Further, D'Alessio et al.\n(1998) showed that the inner disks of classical T Tauri stars\n(CTTS) reach temperatures around T sub = 1800 \u2212 2000 K\ndue to the dust sublimation.

Further, the\nfit with only two grain sizes has been confirmed to be valid by\nBouwman et al. (2001) and Schegerer et al. (2006).

Disk model validity\n\nthan about 5 \u03bcm in general. Therefore, discussing the crystallinity implies that we understand it as a fraction of sub- or\nmicron sized grains. We do not fit features from PAH molecules.\nThe latter produce emission lines at 7.7 \u03bcm, 8.6 \u03bcm, 11.2 \u03bcm\nand 12.8 \u03bcm within the spectral range of our interest (see, e.g.,\nGeers et al. 2006). Rather, we concentrate only on the silicates\ndescribed above and perform the fit with 5 different silicates of\n2 different grain sizes each (consequently, N = 10 different fit\ncomponents). Therefore, we exclude wavelength regions in the\nspectra that clearly show PAH emission features .\n\n4. Results\nWe list the fit results, i.e. the relative mass fractions of the minerals as well as the derived values for qdisk , in Appendix A. Table 3\nlists values of the crystallinity \u0393 which is the sum of all relative\nmass fractions of the crystalline components regardless of their\nsize. The reduced \u03c72red values are listed in the third column, calculated from the averaged fit parameters. In Fig. 4 we present the\nspectrum and resulting fit functions for the example of AA Tau;\nthe complete sample is shown in Appendix B.\nMost of the spectra are fitted reasonably well with a reduced \u03c72red in the range of 1-3. The fit of a few spectra such as\nIRAS 04303+2240, FV Tau, Haro 6-13, MHO-3, and RY Tau\nshow systematic discrepancies between the data and the fit, resulting in a large \u03c72red . In most of these cases, the data show a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio and consequently, the error bars of the\ndata are small. Our fit model is too incomplete to describe these\nobject accurately. In the particular case of IRAS 04303+2240,\nthe spectrum shows a large variety of emission features which\nwe are not able to describe with the selected minerals. We did\nnot intend to increase the complexity of the model to avoid including too many degree of freedom for the bulk of the sample\nwith lower signal-to-noise ratios. We do not use these poorly fitted objects for our further studies.\n\nThe fit method presented here for decomposing the 10 \u03bcm silicate feature takes advantage of a continuous temperature distribution. Therefore, this model is more realistic than previous\nmethods using polynomials (Bouwman et al. 2001), single temperature blackbody functions (Meeus et al. 2003) or two temperature fits (e.g. van Boekel et al. 2005 or Sargent et al. 2009). For\na systematic comparison between the methods, see Juhasz et al.\n(2009).\nWe conclude from the spectral fits that the continuous temperature distribution of the disk is a robust model for approximating the continuum emission. We are able to adjust the background by just one geometrical parameter, i.e. the slope q of the\nradial temperature distribution, which shows the strength and the\nsimplicity of this method. Although previous studies pointed out\nthat the exact shape of the background function has little effect\non the relative composition of the dust mineralogy, the application of a more physical model is appropriate and avoids wrong\nconclusions about dust temperatures from a single blackbody approach. Further, using the TLTD method to describe the silicate\nemission features of the disk atmosphere allows to model the\ncontribution to the 10 \u03bcm flux by grains of varying temperatures.\nAs Juhasz et al. (2009) pointed out, this is crucial to reduce the\nsystematic uncertainty of the decomposition.\nOn the other hand, it has to be mentioned that the temperature profile is assumed to be independent of the dust grain size\nand composition, which is an evident simplification, especially\nat the disk surface. Further, the TLTD method in its presented\nform does not account for radially dependent distributions of\nthe individual dust species. As suggested by Juhasz et al. (2009),\nto optimize the validity of the applied method, we confined the\nwavelength range to the 10 \u03bcm feature only and did not include\nlonger wavelengths. It would be very interesting to extend the\nwavelength range to the full Spitzer IRS spectral coverage; a\nradially dependent distribution of the dust composition will be\nimplemented in the TLTD method in a future study.\n\n\f6\n\nA.

(2009)\n\nMost objects of our sample have been studied likewise by\nSargent et al. (2009) (SA09), using a two temperature decomposition fit (2T fit). Although this method appears to be less realistic, it probes different regions of the disk and is worth to compare\nwith our results. The last two columns of Table 3 list the accumulated values for all crystalline mass fractions for the warm\nand the cold fit components, respectively. The errors have been\ncalculated using standard error propagation of the uncertainties\ngiven in Table 6 of SA09. The method used by SA09 to derive\nthe uncertainties of the fitting parameters is dissimilar from our\nwork and the values for the uncertainties as presented by SA09\nare very conservative. The consequence is that large errors appear in the propagated values for the crystallinity as shown in\nTable 3. Therefore, we expect many objects to have overlaps be-\n\ntween the 1 sigma range of our \u0393-values and the values derived\nby SA09. Indeed, out of 34 common objects, 23 show an overlap with either the warm or the cold component. This number\nincreases to 28 objects when considering our results with a 2\nsigma uncertainty. However, such an ad hoc comparison is not\nvery valuable as a real comparison of the derived crystallinity is\nnot possible: Basically, we should compare our results with the\nwarm dust component of SA09 only as this corresponds more\nlikely to the 10 \u03bcm feature. However, the largest fraction of the\nmass contribution for the two temperature fit is contained in the\ncold component (\u223c100 - 200 K) which does not contribute to the\n10 \u03bcm flux significantly.\n5.2. Correlations between crystallinity and X-ray emission\n\nWe compare stellar high-energy properties with structural characteristics of the dust disk. For this purpose, we correlate the\nX-ray luminosity LX and the product of LX and Hardness H\nwith the total crystalline mass fraction \u0393. Using the full sample of the remaining 37 objects shows that these quantities do\nnot correlate. As discussed in Sect. 2, our sample consists of\nobjects of a wide spread in age and therefore it is likely that\ndifferent evolutionary stages are present even if we are studying class II objects only. As mentioned in Sect. 2, to increase\nthe uniformity of the evolutionary epoch, we selected the objects according their age and divided them into three groups;\nvery young, intermediate and older objects. Unfortunately, our\nsample size decreases to 34 as we lose another three objects\n(IRAS 04187+1927, IRAS 04385+2550 and V410 Anon 13) for\nwhich no age determination could be found in the literature.\nWe found a significant correlation between LX and \u0393 when\nselecting the objects in the intermediate range (\u223c1 Myr to\n\u223c5 Myr). Figure 5 shows the correlation plots for the three\ngroups while the age limits of 1.1 Myr and 4.5 Myr have been\nset to optimize the correlation performance with the number of\nobjects used for the intermediate group (see below). We measure\na correlation coefficient of -0.62 and a significance of 99.7% for\na correlation.\nWe calculate the regression lines LX (\u0393) according the\nordinary least square (OLS) bisector method described by\nIsobe et al. (1990) to treat the two variables symmetrically while\nwe use the logarithmic value of LX . The dashed lines in Fig. 5\ncorrespond to lines with slopes adding and subtracting the regression slope uncertainty as calculated according to Table 1 of\nIsobe et al. (1990).\nWe note here that measurement errors (or errors derived from\nmeasurements) will not be used in the derivation of regression\nlines. If measurement errors are a minor contribution to the scatter around a regression line, then the deviation of a point from\nthe best-fit line is dominated by systematic processes not considered here; using measurement errors as weights for such points\nwill introduce arbitrary bias that is unrelated to the actual scatter\nof the points. This problem has been discussed in detail by Isobe\net al. (1990) and Feigelson & Babu (1992). Is the scatter dominated by unknown, additional processes in our case? The uncertainties in LX of our sample were discussed in G\u00fcdel et al. (2007)\nwith the result that the errors resulting from the X-ray measurement process and the spectral fit procedures are usually smaller\nthan variations due to intrinsic X-ray variability on time scales\nof hours to days. The uncertainty introduced by X-ray variability usually corresponds to a factor of \u223c2 between maximum and\nminimum values. As can be seen in our correlation plots discussed here, such variations are smaller than the scatter around\nthe regression lines. We conclude that other factors not consid-\n\n\fA. M. Glauser et al.: Dust amorphization in protoplanetary disks\n\nFig. 5. X-ray luminosity LX vs. total crystalline mass fraction\n\u0393 for objects of an age within 1.1 \u2212 4.5 Myr (top panel), for\nobjects younger than 1.1 Myr (bottom left panel), and older than\n4.5 Myr (bottom right panel). The lines in the top panel represent\nthe OLS bisector regression (solid) with the uncertainties for the\nslope (dashed).\n\nered here dominate the scatter, and errors from the measurement\nor spectral fit procedures are inappropriate to use here. We therefore use unweighted regression (Isobe et al. 1990).\nTo define the limits of the stellar age for which the correlation works best, we varied the lower and upper limit and\ncalculated the correlation coefficient of the intermediate group.\nFigure 6 shows a map of the correlation coefficient and the correlation significance as a function of the minimum and maximum stellar age used for selecting the sample. We see that the\nminimum and maximum stellar ages for which the correlation is\nstill present, is not sharply defined: It varies between 1-2 Myr\nfor the minimum and 2-4.5 Myr for the maximum age, respectively. This is in agreement with the age uncertainties discussed\nin Sect. 2. Beside the goodness of the fit, we also considered\nthe statistics in terms of the number of selected objects which is\nshown in the upper right panel of Fig. 6. Since we tried to optimize the selection in terms of correlation and statistical sample,\nwe show in the lower right panel of the same figure the product\nof the correlation coefficient and the number of objects. We decided to use objects of age older than 1.1 Myr and younger than\n4.5 Myr and 20 objects satisfied this condition while 14 objects\nfall outside the borders. We emphasize that these age limits are\nsomewhat arbitrary within the typical age uncertainties adopted\nfor our stellar ages (see Sect. 2) and correspond to an optimum\nchoice based on the limited number of objects in our sample. The\nselected age interval should be interpreted as essentially containing CTTS of typical ages in Taurus (\u2248 1 \u2212 5 Myr). We marked\nthe final selection with a circle in Fig. 6.\n\n7\n\nSince we selected the sample according the goodness of decompositional fit of the 10 \u03bcm feature using \u03c72red \u2264 3 as a criterium, we investigated how this cut effects the correlation. For\nthis purpose we added all objects to the sample within the optimum age limits but higher \u03c72red , in particular we added MHO-3\nand RY Tau. The correlation coefficient of this enlarged sample\nwas found to be -0.63 with a probability of 99.6%. This is very\ncomparable to the original result and we conclude that the applied threshold for \u03c72red has no influence on the systematics of\nour study.\nFinally, we plot in Fig. 7 the product of LX and H against\n\u0393, using the same object selection as before. We measure a correlation coefficient of -0.66 with a significance of 99.9%. The\nproduct of LX and H may represent the deposited energy of the\nX-rays in the disk. It is remarkable that the correlation for the\nproduct of LX and the hardness correlate better with the crystalline mass fraction than the X-ray luminosity alone. We investigated the optimum age selection limits as before, and got for\nboth the minimum and maximum age identical values as derived\nfor the LX vs. \u0393 correlation.\nWe repeated this study with the values of the crystalline mass\nfraction derived by SA09 to discuss the dependencies of the\ncorrelation on the applied method. Therefore, we correlated the\ncrystalline mass fractions \u0393c and \u0393w (see Sect. 5.1 and Table 3)\nwith LX . Since the reduced \u03c72red in SA09 are systematically high,\nwe had to increase the limit to \u03c72red \u2264 5 to calculate the correlation with a sufficient sample. With this approach we use a sam-\n\nFig. 6.

The circles indicate our\nselection of the stellar age for which the correlation coefficient\nand the statistics has been optimized. The straight lines indicate\nwhere the minimum and maximum age limitations are identical.\n\n\f8\n\nA. M. Glauser et al.: Dust amorphization in protoplanetary disks\n\nlittle momentum to damage the crystalline structure of the dust.\nTheir energy will rather be absorbed by the electrons, which temporarily leads to ionization of lattice atoms and finally to the production of phonons and a resulting increase of the temperature\nwithin the grain.\nAlthough the processes of X-ray emission are still controversial for T Tauri objects, it seems clear that they mostly originate in magnetic coronae analogous to the solar corona, although stellar coronae are much more X-ray luminous and hotter. Therefore, we assume that the X-ray emission of our sample\nof T Tauri stars is related to the high energy processes in the stellar corona that also lead to a solar-like wind composed of ions,\nelectrons and neutrons. We show in the following that the flux\nof the solar wind and the particle energies would be sufficient\nto amorphize dust grains efficiently in a protoplanetary disk at a\nradius of 1 AU and that this process induces significant changes\nin the emission profile of the dust grains. Although we may observe the silicates at larger distances from their central object,\nthe choice of 1 AU is based on the availability of data from the\nsolar wind and allows for an extrapolation to larger distances. We\nuse a simple disk model where homogeneous dust grains at the\ndisk surface are directly exposed to the stellar wind and where\nrecrystallization effects are neglected.\n5.3.1. Stellar wind properties\n\nFig. 7. Product of the X-ray luminosity LX and the X-ray hardness H vs. total crystalline mass fraction \u0393 for objects of an\nage within 1.1 \u2212 4.5 Myr (top panel), for objects younger than\n1.1 Myr (bottom left panel), and older than 4.5 Myr (bottom right\npanel).\n\nple of 20 common objects of which 14 fall into the age range\nof 1.1-4.5 Myr. We found that \u0393w correlates weakly with LX\n(corr=-0.54, P=95.6 %) and strongly with H * LX (corr=-0.65,\nP=98.9 %). \u0393c does not correlate with any of these parameters\nat all. Further, repeating the investigation of the age range selection showed a comparable picture to the valid range (1.1-1.5 Myr\nfor the lower limit and 1.5-6 Myr for the upper limit).\nThis result confirms three aspects of our study: First, the correlation seems to be independent of the applied fitting method\nand is therefore not biased by the systematics of the decomposition approach. Second, our TLTD fit refers to the 10 \u03bcm feature,\nfor which we found a correlation between crystallinity and LX\n. In the 2T fit (as used by SA09), the 10 \u03bcm feature is emitted\nby the warm component, and a corresponding correlation is indeed found. Our focus on the 10 \u03bcm silicate feature is therefore\njustified a posteriori as the cold component from the 2T fit does\nnot show a correlation. And third, we see in both data sets that\nthe correlation for the combined product of hardness and X-ray\nluminosity is better than for the X-ray luminosity alone.\n5.3. Is the dust amorphized by the stellar wind?\n\nIt is a remarkable result that an anticorrelation between the Xray emission and the crystalline mass fraction is found; so far,\nno correlation between properties of the central object and the\ncrystalline structure of the dust disk has been reported from observations (e.g., Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2007).\nHowever, the observed anticorrelation demands an indirect\nexplanation because X-rays of the observed energies carry too\n\nWe first derive the particle fluxes and energies from data from\nthe solar wind as this is the only object for which direct and reliable measurements of these parameters are available. We know\nfrom the enrichment of spallation products in meteorites that the\nyoung Sun had a proton flux several orders of magnitude higher\nthan at present (Caffe et al. 1987). Unfortunately, the energies\nwhich lead to nuclear spallation are in the order of E > 10 MeV\nwhile the energies of interest for amorphization are E < 1 MeV\n(see below and, e.g., J\u00e4ger et al. 2003). The processes producing\nthese energies might be different and consequently it may not be\ncorrect to scale particle fluxes with the well measured soft X-ray\nflux for younger stars. Therefore, we proceed with present solar\nparticle fluxes and energies and use its amorphization potential\nas a lower limit.\nWe used the database from OMNIWeb (King & Papitashvili\n2005) to determine the present proton density of the solar wind\nplasma, its velocities and proton to He-ion ratio near the Earth.\nWe averaged the full dataset over the years 1963 until 2008\nand obtained a density of \u223c7.2 protons/cm3, a wind speed of\n\u223c450 km/s and a He-ion to proton ratio of \u223c4.4 %. Uncertainties\nof these quantities are up to 30 %. This leads to a mean proton\nflux of 3.2*108 protons/(cm2*s) at energies around 1 keV and to\na He-ion flux of 1.4*107 ions/(cm2 *s) at energies around 4 keV.\n5.3.2. Calculation of dust amorphization\n\nWe use these values to compare them with the ion dose required\nto amorphize a dust grain. For this purpose we calculate the number of displacements of lattice atoms per incident ion using the\nSRIM-2008 software (Ziegler et al. 2008). SRIM is a collection\nof software packages which calculate many features of the transport of ions in matter such as ion stopping, range and straggling\ndistributions in multilayer targets of any material. Further, it allows the calculation of ion implantation including damages to\nsolid targets by atom displacement, sputtering and transmission\nin mixed gas/solid targets. Table 4 summarizes the calculation\nperformed for two minerals, pyroxene and enstatite, respectively,\n\n\fA. M. Glauser et al.: Dust amorphization in protoplanetary disks\n\nirradiated by protons and He-ions at various energies. With the\nSRIM software we determined the penetration depth (range) of\nthe ion and the number of displaced lattice atoms (due to elastic\nscattering on the atom's nuclei) per incident ion.\nThe mineral densities have been taken from the webmineral database1 . We determine the required ion dose for complete\namorphization of the dust grain material down to the penetration\ndepth of the incident ion by deriving the column density of the\nlattice atoms. Further, we require a quantity for how many displacements per lattice atom (dpa) are required to observe amorphization. We set this number to be 2.5 based on the mineral irradiation experiments for enstatite (J\u00e4ger et al. 2003), forsterite\n(Bringa et al. 2007) and olivine (Demyk et al. 2001; Carrez et al.\n2002). However, this quantity remains inaccurate as most of the\nabove cited studies determined doses for He-irradiation to fully\namorphize the minerals varying within an order of magnitude.\nJ\u00e4ger et al. (2003) presented a dpa-value of 2.5 but the lowest\nHe-ion energy used was 50 keV. For protons, we assume the\nsame dpa ratio although this is hypothetical.\nTable 4 further shows that NDisp /ion increases with increasing energy but the required dose for amorphization increases as\nwell. This can be explained from the definition of the required\ndose. With higher energies, the ions penetrate deeper into the\ndust grain and consequently a thicker layer will be amorphized.\nThis requires a larger total number of displacements as more lattice atoms are impacted.\nWe can therefore conclude from this calculation that the\nHe-ions of the present solar wind would amorphize the top\n\u223c30 nm of the irradiated face of a pyroxene dust grain and the required dose of \u223c2.3*1016 ions/cm2 would be accumulated within\n\u223c50 years. To allow the full surface to be amorphized, the dust\ngrain has to rotate with respect to the ion beam to allow for an\nisotropic irradiation, and the timescale has to be increased by a\nfactor of a few. Obviously this indicates a very efficient mechanism for amorphization and might be even more efficient as we\nhave ignored the irradiation by other ions.\nOn the other hand, this calculation assumes that all dust\ngrains are fully exposed to the radiation of the central object.\nThis is obviously not true for the majority of the observable\ngrains in the disk atmosphere. The ion flux gets extinct analogue\nto optical light due to absorption by dust grains (self-shielding)\nand therefore, the amorphization timescale depends strongly on\nthe location of the grain within the disk and the presence of vertical mixing of the disk material. Therefore, the 50 years of irradiation time represent the timescale for amorphization, based on\nthe full flux. This number will increase exponentially (or faster)\nthe deeper the grains are located in the disk. Consequently, our\nobservations probe various timescales for dust amorphization;\nconclusions depending on whether the presented mechanisms\nare too efficient or too inefficient cannot be made at the present\ntime. Knowing the mean free path length along the particle trajectories would enable more quantitative conclusions about the\namorphization timescale and potential with respect to other dust\nprocessing mechanisms. Particles of higher energies could also\nbe considered by studying multiple scattering of ions with dust\ngrains. This would allow an amorphization of dust deeper in the\ndisk. For this purpose, dedicated modeling of the disk geometry\nand grain size distribution is required. This will be addressed in\nfuture studies.\nFor now, we can conclude that the dust amorphization by\nstellar wind ions at the disk surface is sufficiently efficient so\n1\n\nwww.webmineral.com\n\n9\n\nthat this mechanism might dominate the dust processing at the\ndisk surface layer.\n5.3.3. Optical properties and grain size dependency\n\nSince the dust grains are amorphized only at the surface layer,\nthe impact on the optical emissivity has to be investigated to\ndemonstrate the observability of the amorphization of circumstellar dust by the low energetic stellar wind.\nAs an example, we calculate the optical mass absorption coefficients of crystalline pyroxene, coated with a 30 nm thick\nlayer of amorphous pyroxene using Mie theory according to\nBohren & Huffman (1983) for coated spheres. The calculation\ncode in the appendix B of Bohren & Huffman (1983) has been\ntranslated by M\u00e4tzler (2002) into a Matlab script which we\nhave used for this study. The optical constants from J\u00e4ger et al.\n(1994) were used for crystalline pyroxene while parameters for\nthe amorphous pyroxene are taken from Dorschner et al. (1995).\nFigure 8 shows the resulting mass absorption coefficient\nwithin the wavelength range of interest for a dust grain of 0.1 \u03bcm\nand 1.26\u03bcm in radius, respectively. Further, this plot indicates\n\nFig. 8. The thick, solid line corresponds to the mass absorption\ncoefficient of a 2-layer spherical dust grain with pyroxene stoichiometry and a radius of 0.1 \u03bcm (left) and 1.26 \u03bcm (right).\nThe outer layer is amorphous with a thickness of 30 nm in both\ncases and the core is crystalline. The dotted line corresponds to a\npure crystalline and the dashed line to a pure amorphous grain of\nthe same size and chemical composition. The red, thin solid line\nshows a decomposition fit of the 2-layer absorption coefficient\nwith a purely amorphous and purely crystalline component and\na crystalline mass fraction of \u0393=28.1% and \u0393=93.5% is measured, respectively. Due to the high crystalline mass fraction for\nthe larger grain, the dotted, red and thick lines overlap in the\nright panel.\n\nthe two extremes of a purely crystalline grain and a purely amorphous pyroxene grain. Finally, we calculate a linear combination\nof the two extremes to fit the 2-layer case and get a contribution\nratio for the crystalline dust of \u0393=28.1% for the 0.1 \u03bcm grain\nand \u0393=93.5% for the 1.26 \u03bcm grain, where \u0393 corresponds to\nthe same definition as used for the decomposition fits. This result reflects the mass ratio used for the coated sphere calculation (29.1% crystalline for the 0.1 \u03bcm grain and 93.0% for the\n1.26 \u03bcm grain) with relatively high accuracy. Consequently, even\nif the dust grains are amorphized in the surface layer only, the\nspectrally derived value for amorphization corresponds to the\nmass ratio of crystalline and amorphous silicates and conclusions about dust amorphization are valid even for low-energy\nions.\n\n\f10\n\nA.

For the calculation of the dose, a minimal displacement per lattice atom (dpa) of\n2.5 have been assumed to observe amorphization.\n\nStellar Wind\nSpeed\n[km/s]\n300\n400\n450\n500\n600\n700\n800\n1384\n3094\n300\n400\n450\n500\n600\n700\n800\n1553\n\nParticle\nEnergy\n[keV]\n0.5\n0.8\n1.1\n1.3\n1.9\n2.6\n3.3\n10.0\n50.0\n1.9\n3.3\n4.2\n5.2\n7.5\n10.2\n13.3\n50.0\n\nPyroxene, \u03c1 = 1.2 * 1023 atoms\ncm3\nRange\nNDisp.\nDose\nions\nion\n[nm]\n*1016 cm\n2\n8.3\n0.8\n30.7\n12\n1.5\n23.7\n15.8\n2.1\n22.3\n17.7\n2.4\n21.8\n24.4\n3.3\n21.9\n31.7\n4\n23.5\n38.8\n4.7\n24.4\n97.2\n8.2\n35.1\n332.7\n12.6\n78.2\n14.4\n20.1\n2.1\n23.4\n31.1\n2.2\n29.1\n36.9\n2.3\n35.7\n42.6\n2.5\n50.5\n53.3\n2.8\n67.5\n63.8\n3.1\n84.9\n72.7\n3.5\n263.4 116.2\n6.7\n\nHowever, the provided calculation assumes a purely crystalline dust grain. We expect to see a mixture of amorphous and\ncrystalline dust regardless of the stellar wind and its impact on\nthe dust structure. Consequently, the model described here delivers only an additional component for the amorphous dust content\nand values for \u0393 are expected to be lower than these limits.\nFurther, the results of the decompositional fits of our sample (see Table A) suggest that a significant amount of the dust\nis present in larger grains and hence, the discussed mechanism\nmight not be applicable. However, we repeated this study considering only small grains and no correlation between LX and \u0393\nwas found. It is very likely that higher energetic ions are important and more abundant than in the present solar system.\nThese ions penetrate deeper into the dust grain and consequently,\nlarger grains are amorphized. Therefore, the approach of using a\nmonochromatic ion beam with solar wind properties is too elementary and has to be extended for more quantitative studies.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe previous calculations show that the amorphization of the\nsurface layer of the protoplanetary dust by the stellar wind is a\nviable scenario. We have seen that a stellar wind with solar characteristics allows a very fast amorphization of the upper layer of\ndust grains compared to the longer timescales of dust processing\nduring the star and disk formation. For sub-micron grains, this\nprocess leads to an observable structural change of the grain.\nHowever, these processes are inefficient for micron-sized\ngrains or larger bodies as the penetration depth of the lowenergetic ions are too small to degrade the dust sufficiently.\nOn the other hand, as young stars are generally more active,\nwe can assume that particle fluxes and energies are generally\nhigher than in the present solar wind and consequently, the described processes may be even more efficient. Further, the solar\nirradiation is not only composed of the solar wind but a great va-\n\nEnstatite, \u03c1 = 9.6 * 1022 atoms\ncm3\nRange\nNDisp.\nDose\nions\nion\n[nm]\n*1016 cm\n2\n9.4\n0.8\n28.2\n10.7\n1.5\n17.1\n17.3\n2.1\n19.8\n19.6\n2.5\n18.8\n26.6\n3.3\n19.3\n35.5\n4.1\n20.8\n43\n4.8\n21.5\n107.1\n8.1\n31.7\n364.5\n12.4\n70.6\n15.5\n19.4\n1.9\n26.3\n31.1\n2.0\n33.6\n36.6\n2.2\n40.1\n42.3\n2.3\n56.5\n52.8\n2.6\n74.3\n62.7\n2.8\n95.5\n71\n3.2\n292\n113\n6.2\n\nriety of additional particles at various energies and fluxes. Since\nour knowledge of these particle fluxes (E <\n\u223c10 MeV) in the early\ntime of the solar history is very poor, and since particle irradiation in other systems are unmeasurable, the assessment of the\namorphization efficiency remains very inaccurate and difficult.\nOther irradiation sources than the star, such as shocks from stellar winds in the protoplanetary gas disk or from accretion or jets\nconfuse the overall picture further. Recrystallization due to thermal annealing of warmer dust grains (see, e.g., Djouadi et al.\n2005) may inhibit the amorphization process and needs to be\ntaken into account for quantitative models.\nNonetheless, we observe a correlation for 20 objects between\nthe X-ray luminosity as well as the X-ray luminosity multiplied\nwith the X-ray hardness and the crystalline mass fraction of the\natmospheric dust of the inner protoplanetary disk for objects\nwithin an age range of approx. 1 to 4.5 Myr. We interpret this\nas an indicator of high-energy processes in the central object.\nWe therefore postulate degenerative processes for the crystalline\nstructure of the dust by ionic irradiation. Although we cannot\nobserve the stellar wind directly, its flux and/or speed might be\nrelated to the X-ray luminosity, as shown for low X-ray fluxes\nby Wood et al. (2005) by comparing stellar mass loss rates with\nX-ray surface fluxes.\nSelf-shielding effects of the dust disk play an important role\nfor the time scale and the overall potential of amorphization.\nConsequently, the disk geometry and the dust density distribution have to be taken into account for studying evolutionary effects. Further, self-shielding could explain why the correlation\ndiminishes if we include objects younger than \u223c1 Myr. These\nobjects might have well mixed disks even in the upper disk atmosphere where dust settling has poorly progressed; consequently,\nthe self-shielding is more relevant.\nIt is less clear why the correlation worsens if we include\nobjects older than \u223c4.5 Myr. It could be related to a statistical\nproblem as our sample does not include many objects at such\n\n\fA. M. Glauser et al.: Dust amorphization in protoplanetary disks\n\nages. Further physical effects may also play a role on longer time\nscales. Possibilities include radial dust mixing or the reproduction of crystalline dust material in the inner disk region.\nIt would be interesting to verify if this correlation is present\nin other star forming regions and for a larger sample of objects.\nThe extension of this study to Herbig Ae/Be systems could provide different aspects of this process due to the shorter evolutionary time scales of the central object.\nAcknowledgements.
