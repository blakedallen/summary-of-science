INTRODUCTION\nAutomatic license plate localisation from vehicle\nimages and subsequent recognition of alphanumeric\ncharacters from the localized license plates has long\nbeen an active area of research because of its\npotential use in various applications in our daily life.\nThe main objective of such systems is to localize the\nlicense plate region(s) from the vehicle images\ncaptured through a road-side camera and interpret\nthem using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\nsystem. The localization of license plate is itself a\nchallenging task due to its wide variations in size,\nshape, colour, texture, spatial orientation and noise.\nUsually such system consists of three main parts:\nlicense plate localisation, character segmentation and\ncharacter recognition. Out of these license plate\nlocalisation is the most important and also most\ndifficult task compared to the other two. The main\nway through which a license plate can be localised\ndepends on its distinguished colour, contrast and the\ncharacter pattern of it. To extract proper information\nof the license plate, the binarization of the image is\nan utmost requirement. In a controlled environment\nand with accurate acquisition of image, the\nbinarization remains more or less easier. But in a\npractical outdoor scenario the image is heavily\ncorrupted by variation of different uncontrolled\nimpairments, such as lighting conditions, colour/\ngrey scale content, wind turbulence, vibration of\ncamera etc. Finding a generalised way of\nbinarization becomes a trivial task in these\nconditions.\nBinarization is the method of converting a gray\nscale image (popularly known as multi-tone image)\ninto a black-and-white image (popularly known as\ntwo-tone image). This conversion is based on finding\na threshold gray value and deciding whether a pixel\nhaving a particular gray value is to be converted to\n\nblack or white. Usually within an image the pixels\nhaving gray value greater than the threshold is\ntransformed to white and the pixels having gray\nvalue lesser than the threshold is transformed to\nblack. Binarization has been the area of research for\nlast fifteen years or so, mainly to find a single\nthreshold value or a set of threshold values for\nconverting a gray scale image into a binary image.\nMost of the algorithms till developed are of generic\ntype using statistical parameters computed over the\nimage with or without using local information or\nspecial content within the image.\nThe most convenient and primitive method is to\nfind a global threshold for the whole image and\nbinarize the image using the single threshold. In this\ntechnique, the local variations are actually\nsuppressed or lost, though they may have important\ncontribution towards the information content within\nit. On the other hand, in case of determining the\nthreshold locally, a window is used around a pixel\nand threshold value is calculated for the window.\nNow depending on whether the threshold is to be\nused for the center pixel of the window or for all the\npixels in the window, the binarization is done on\npixel-by-pixel basis, where each pixel may have a\ncalculated threshold value, or on region-by-region\nbasis where all pixels in a region or window have\nsame threshold value.\nThe major contribution of research for binarization\nis to recover or extract information from a degraded\ndocument image. Otsu [1] developed a method based\non gray level histogram and maximizes the intraclass variance to total variance. Sauvola [2]\ndeveloped an algorithm for text and picture\nsegmentation within an image and binarized the\nimage using local threshold. Gatos [3] used Wiener\nfilter and Sauvola's adaptive binarization method. In\nthe work presented in [4] also Sauvola's adaptive\n\n\f271\nInternational Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information\nTechnology (C3IT 2009)\nthresholding is used for binarization. Valverde [5]\nbinariesd the image using Niblack's technique. A\nslight modification of Niblack's method is done in\n[6] by Zhang.\nThe main objective of the present work is to\nlocalize the license plate which is nothing but the\ntext region within the image. We have applied\nhistogram equalization method over the whole image\nglobally and also over different hierarchy of image\npartitions. A novel scheme is formulated for giving\nthe membership value to each pixel for each level of\nhistogram equalization. Then the image is binarized\ndepending on the net membership value of each\npixel.\n2. COLLECTION OF DATASET\nThe dataset for the current work has been\nconstructed as a part of a demonstration project on\nAutomated Red Light Violation Detection system for\na Government traffic monitoring authority of a major\nmetro city in India. An important road crossing in\nKolkata is selected for collection of dataset. Three\nsurveillance cameras were installed at the crossing at\na height of around ten meters from the road surface.\nThe major objective was to capture the images of red\nsignal violating vehicles only. To serve the purpose,\nall the surveillance cameras were synchronized with\nthe traffic signaling system such that the cameras\ncapture the snapshots only when the traffic signal for\na particular lane is turned RED. All the cameras were\nfocused on the Stop-Line to capture frontal images of\nvehicles violating the Stop-Line on a RED traffic\nsignal.\nThe complete image dataset comprises of more\nthan 15,000 surveillance video snapshots, captured\nover several days/nights in an unconstrained\nenvironment accommodating varying outdoor\nlighting conditions, pollution levels, wind\nturbulences and vibrations of the camera. 24-bit\ncolor bitmaps were captured through CCD cameras\nwith a frame rate of 25 fps and resolution of 704 x\n576 pixels. It is seen that in many images there is no\nlicense plate, or partial license plate. For the current\nexperiment, we have identified 2428 images with\ncomplete license plate regions appearing in different\norientations in the image frame.\n3. THE PRESENT WORK\nIt is already described in the previous section that\ntrue color video snapshots of resolution 704 \u00d7 576\npixels were captured through multiple surveillance\ncameras over day and night with embedded noise\nand huge variations in image quality.\n3.1. Gray scale conversion\nFrom the 24-bit color value of each pixel the R, G\nand B components are separated and the 8-bit gray\nvalue is calculated using the formula:\ngray(i, j) = 0.59 * R(i, j) + 0. 30 * G(i, j) + 0. 11 * B(i, j)\n\n(1)\nwhere, (i,j) indicates the location of a pixel.\n\n3.2. Median filtering\nMedian filter is a non-linear filter, which replaces\nthe gray value of a pixel by the median of the gray\nvalues of its neighbors. In this work, median filter\nhaving 3 \uf0b4 3 mask is applied over the gray scale\nimage to get eight neighbors of a pixel and their\ncorresponding gray values. This operation removes\nsalt-and-peeper noise from the image.\n3.3. Histogram equalization\nContrast of each image is enhanced through\nhistogram equalization technique, as discussed in [7].\nTotal 256 numbers of gray levels (from 0 to 255) are\nused for stretching the contrast. Let total number of\npixels in the image is N and the number of pixels\nhaving gray level k be nk. Then the probability of\noccurrence of gray level k is, Pk = nk / N. The\nstretched gray level Sk is calculated using the\ncumulative frequency of occurrence of the gray level\nk in the original image using the formula:\nk n\nj\n(2)\nS k \uf03d \uf0e5 \uf0b4 255\nj \uf03d0 N\nwhere, 255 indicates the maximum gray level in the\nenhanced image. This Sk divided by 255 results an\nenhanced fractional gray value (fg=Sk/255) of a pixel\nin the range 0 to 1 and gives the likeliness of a pixel\nto be white. A fraction close to 1 indicates that the\nmethod suggests the pixel to be white. On the other\nhand a fraction close to 0 indicates that the method\nsuggests the pixel to be black. Application of\nhistogram equalization method over the whole image\ngives 0th level membership value (fmem(i,j,0)= fg) of\npixel (i,j).\n3.4. Hierarchical partitioning of image and\napplication of histogram equalization in each\nimage partitions\nFour equal segments of the image are generated by\npartitioning the image midway both width wise and\nheight wise and histogram equalization method is\napplied in each segment separately over the original\ndata. This provides 1st level membership value\n(fmem(i,j,1)) of pixel (i,j). Likewise each of the 1st\nlevel segments is divided into four equal segments\nand histogram equalization method is applied over\neach sub-segment to get the 2nd level membership\nvalue (fmem(i,j,2)) of pixel (i,j). This process goes\non upto nth sub-segment and nth level membership\nvalue (fmem(i,j,n)) is obtained for pixel (i,j).\n3.5. Combining membership values of each pixel\nAs discussed in the last subsection, for each level\nof contrast enhancement through histogram\nequalization, each pixel gets an enhanced fractional\ngray value leading to a membership value\n(fmem(i,j,level)) indicating that whether the said\npixel is closer to white or black. These membership\nvalues for each pixel are combined to get a net\nmembership value for each pixel. Now as the global\nscenario has a little effect over the local variations\n\n\f272\nInternational Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information\nTechnology (C3IT 2009)\nduring the process of combination the local\nmembership values are given more weightage over\nglobal membership values. Keeping this in mind the\nnet membership value for pixel (i,j) is calculated\nusing the formula:\nn\n\nf net \uf028i, j , level \uf029 \uf03d\n\n\uf0e5 f \uf028i, j, level \uf029\uf028level \uf02b 1\uf029\n\nlevel \uf03d 0\n\n2\n\nmem\n\nn\n\n(3)\n\n\uf0e5 \uf028level \uf02b 1\uf029\n\n2\n\nlevel \uf03d 0\n\nwhere, the summation, \u03a3 , is over the levels 0 to n.\nThus during the process each pixel gets a net\nmembership value in which it retains the global as\nwell as the local information of the variation of gray\nlevel.\n3.6. Binarization\nAs discussed in the last two subsections, for each\npixel a net membership value is obtained, which is\ncompared with the threshold value for binarization.\nAs the image is histogram equalized image, the mean\ngray level lies in the middle position of the gray\nscale range (0 to 255). Thus 0.5 is chosen as\nthreshold and any pixel having net membership value\ngreater than 0.5 is converted to white, otherwise it is\nconverted to black.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nAs discussed in Section 2, about 15000 24-bit\ncolor bitmaps were captured through CCD cameras\nwith a frame rate of 25 fps and resolution of 704 x\n576 pixels. They are converted to gray scale and the\nalgorithm is applied on 2428 number of gray scale\nimages. Our algorithm finds the membership value\nof each pixel for each level of localization. For the\npurpose of full image binarization, we have used\nlevel 2 to 8 and for binarizing license plate only we\nhave used level 0 to 3. For the same set of images we\nhave used Otsu's method of binarization as a\nbenchmark and compared the two sets of result.\nFig. 1(a-h) shows a sample set of grey-scale\nvehicle images over which the proposed binarization\nalgorithm and Otsu's algorithm are applied upon.\n\n(a)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n(h)\nFig. 1(a-h).

CONCLUSION\nIn the present work, we have developed an\nefficient way of binarizing a vehicle image captured\nin a practical outdoor scenario. We have applied\nOtsu's binarization algorithm over the images but\nour method seems to be more effective in binarizing\nthe image. The algorithm is applied on a dataset of\n2428 natural traffic images and satisfactory result is\nobtained in most cases. After localization of license\nplate the characters are to be segmented and\nrecognize. During this segmentation phase also\nbinarization is done again over the original data of\nlocalized license plate only. Our algorithm performs\nsatisfactorily well on this reduced data space also.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nAuthors are thankful to the CMATER and the\nSRUVM project, C.S.E.
