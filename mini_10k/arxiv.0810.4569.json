In a recent paper, Iwaki-Juriaans-Souza Filho continued this line of research\nby partially classifying the finite semigroups whose rational semigroup algebra contains a Zorder with hyperbolic unit group. In this paper we complete this classification by handling the\ncase in which the semigroup is semi-simple.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we continue the investigations on the hyperbolic property. Recall ([3]) that a\nunital Q-algebra A is said to have the hyperbolic property if the unit group U(\u0393) of every Z-order\n\u0393 in A does not contain a free abelian subgroup Z2 of rank 2. If A has finite Q-dimension, then\nhaving the hyperbolic property is equivalent to the unit group of Z-orders being hyperbolic groups\nin the sense of Gromov [2] and it is sufficient to verify the required condition on only one Z-order\nin A.\nThe finite groups G for which its rational group algebra QG is hyperbolic have been characterized\nin [4]. In [6] this problem has been dealt with for rational group algebras of arbitrary groups and\nin [7] one deals with groups algebras of finite groups over quadratic extensions of the rationals. A\nnatural question is to extend these results to the much wider class of (unital) rational semigroup\nalgebras of finite semigroups. A first step in this direction is given in [5] where the finite semigroups\nS are classified whose integral semigroup ring ZS has trivial units. In a recent paper ([3]), IwakiJuriaans-Souza Filho classified the finite semigroups S such that QS has the hyperbolic property,\nthis provided that either QS is semi-simple or S is not a semi-simple semigroup. See also [8] and\n[12] for results in the same direction.\nIn this paper we complete the classification started in [3]. In particular, we need to handle the\ncase in which S is semi-simple, that is, every principal factor of S is simple or 0-simple and QS\nis not semi-simple. The reader is referred to [1, 10] for background on semigroups and semigroup\nalgebras. For convenience sake, we recall that the contracted semigroup algebra of a semigroup\nwith zero element \u03b8 is denoted by Q0 S and defined as QS/Q\u03b8. Since any semigroup algebra can be\nconsidered as a contracted semigroup algebra, we will state our results in this more general context.\nWithout specifically stating this, throughout the paper we assume that Q0 S is unital. Also recall\nthat a finite 0-simple semigroup is isomorphic with a Rees matrix semigroup M0 (G\u03b8 , m, n; P ),\n\u2217 Mathematics subject Classification Primary [16U 60, 20M 25]; Secondary [20M 10, 16S36]. Keywords and phrases:\nSemigroup, Semigroup Algebras, Hyperbolic Groups, Group Rings, Units.\nThis research is supported in part by Onderzoeksraad of Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk\nOnderzoek (Flanders) and Flemish-Polish bilateral agreement BIL2005/VUB/06.\n\n1\n\n\fwhere n and m are positive integers and G is a finite group. This is by definition the set of all\nm \u00d7 n-matrices over G\u03b8 , the group G with a zero \u03b8 adjoined, with at all entries in G\u03b8 and at\nmost one entry different from \u03b8. The matrix P is an n \u00d7 m-matrix with entries in G\u03b8 and it\nis regular (i.e., each row and column contains at least one non-zero element). The product of\nA, B \u2208 M0 (G\u03b8 , m, n; P ) is A \u25e6 P \u25e6 B, where \u25e6 denotes the usual matrix product. The Jacobson\nradical of a ring R we denote by J(R). An example that will be\nin our classification\n\u0012 of importance\n\u0013\n1\n0\nis the Rees matrix semigroup T = M ({1}, 1, 2, P ) with P =\n. Clearly, T = {e, f, \u03b8} with\n1\nef = f , e2 = e, f 2 = f , f e = e, \u03b82 = \u03b8, and e\u03b8 = \u03b8e = f \u03b8 = \u03b8f = \u03b8. By T 1 we denote the smallest\nmonoid containing T , thus T 1 = T \u222a {1}, with t1 = 1t for all t \u2208 T . Clearly, J(Q0 T 1 ) = Q(e \u2212 f )\nand Q0 T 1 = Q(e \u2212 f ) + Q(1 \u2212 e) + Q(e) \u223c\n= T2 (Q), the upper triangular 2 \u00d7 2-matrices over Q. So\nthe semigroup algebra Q0 T 1 has the hyperbolic property. We will show, in some sense, that this is\nprecisely the only case not covered by the main result of [3].\n\n2\n\nHyperbolic semigroup algebras\n\nFor the convenience of the reader we recall the main result in [3] on the structure of finite\ndimensional algebras with the hyperbolic property.\nTheorem 2.1 [3, Theorem 3.1] A finite dimensional Q -algebra A has the hyperbolic property if\nand only if one of the following holds:\n1. J(A) = {0} and A = \u2295i Di \u2295 B,\n2. dimQ J(A) = 1 and A/J(A) = \u2295i Di ,\nwhere each Di is either Q, a quadratic imaginary extension of Q or is a totally definite quaternion\nalgebra over the rationals and where either B \u2208 {{0}, M2(Q)} or B has a Z-order whose unit group\nis non-torsion and hyperbolic.\nIn case A has the hyperbolic property with J(A) 6= {0} then either J(A) is central in A or A is\na direct product of division algebras and T2 (Q), the 2 \u00d7 2-upper triangular matrices over Q.\nNote that required conditions on the division algebras Di say that the unit group of an order\nin Di has to be finite.\nAn obvious consequence of the Theorem is that ideals I of finite dimensional hyperbolic rational\nalgebras A also have an algebraic structure as described in 1. or 2. of Theorem 2.1. Here we\nconsider I as a K-algebra, but it does not necessarily contain an identity. Abusing terminology,\nwe also will say that such algebras are hyperbolic. Since these facts are crucial for the proof of our\ndescription of hyperbolic rational semigroup algebras we formulate them in a corollary.\nCorollary 2.2 Let A be a finite dimensional rational algebra. If A is hyperbolic then epimorphic\nimages and ideals of A are hyperbolic. In particular, if J(I) = J(A)\u2229I = {0} then I has an identity\nand thus A \u223c\n= I \u00d7 (A/I), a direct product of algebras.\nLemma 2.3 Let G be a finite group and S a Rees semigroup S = M0 (G; m, n; P ) with regular\nsandwich matrix P = (pi,j ). If Q0 S has the hyperbolic property then nm\n\u0012 = 1, 2\u0013 or 4. Furthermore,\n1 1\nif nm 6= 1 then G = {1} and nm = 2 or n = m = 2 and P 6=\n. If nm = 2 then\n1 1\nJ(Q0 S) 6= {0} and Q0 S/J(Q0 S) \u223c\n= Q, and if n = m = 2 then Q0 S \u223c\n= M2 (Q).\n2\n\n\fProof. Normalizing P , we may without loss of generality assume that p1,1 = 1. There is a natural\nepimorphism S = M0 (G; m, n; P ) \u2212\u2192 S = M0 ({1}; m, n; P ), where P is the matrix obtained from\nP by replacing an entry g \u2208 G by 1. We thus obtain a natural Q-algebra epimorphism of contracted\nsemigroup algebras Q0 S \u2212\u2192 Q0 S. Because of Corollary 2.2, also the algebra Q0 S has the hyperbolic\nproperty. Recall the well known fact that Q0 M0 ({1}; m, n; P ) \u223c\n= M(Q, n, m; P ), a Munn algebra\nover the rationals. Hence (see [9, Theorem 3.6] or [10, Lemma 5.21]), Q0 S/J(Q0 S) \u223c\n= M2 (Q)t ,\nwhere t is the rank of P . Because of Theorem 2.1, we then also know that t = 1 if the radical\nis non-trivial and t = 2 otherwise. As also dimQ J(Q0 S) \u2264 2 we thus obtain that mn \u2212 1 = 1 or\nnm = 4 respectively. The former yields mn = 2.\nNow, as usual, we denote a non-zero matrix in S as (g, i, j), where g \u2208 G is the only non-zero\nentry in position (i, j). All matrices of the type (\u03b8, i, j) are identified with the zero element (also\ndenoted by \u03b8) of S. Hence the product in S is as follows: (g, i, j) (h, k, l) = (gpj,k h, i, l).\nWe now exclude the case that m = 1 and n = 4 (and similarly, m = 4 and n = 1 is excluded).\nSuppose the contrary, then (1, 1, 1)\u2212(1, 1, 2) and (1, 1, 1)\u2212(1, 1, 3) are linearly independent nilpotent\nelements of the hyperbolic algebra Q0 (S). However, this is in contradiction with the dimension of\nthe Jacobson radical being at most one.\nIf n = m = 2 (and thus J(Q0 (S)) = {0}) then the mapping Q0 S \u223c\n= M(Q, 2, 2; P ) \u2212\u2192 M2 (Q) :\nA 7\u2192 A \u25e6 P is an isomorphism (note that its kernel consists\nof\nnilpotent\nelements). Hence P \u2208\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\nGL2 (Q). Therefore the regular matrix can not be equal to\n. Hence P (and thus also P )\n1 1\nis an upper or lower triangular matrix. So P is invertible over QG. Consequently the mapping\nQ0 S \u223c\n= M(QG, 2, 2; P ) \u2212\u2192 M2 (QG) : A 7\u2192 A \u25e6 P is an isomorphism. Theorem 2.1 then yields that\n|G| = 1.\nFinally, suppose that nm = 2 and thus t = 1. So all nilpotent elements belong J(Q0 S). By\nsymmetry, we then may assume that n \u2265 2. Let g \u2208 G, a = (gp2,1 , 1, 1) and b = (g, 1, 2). Then,\nbecause p1,1 = 1, (a \u2212 b)2 = (gp2,1 gp2,1 , 1, 1) + (gp2,1 g, 1, 2) \u2212 (gp2,1 g, 1, 2) \u2212 (gp2,1 gp2,1 , 1, 1) = 0.\nConsequently, a \u2212 b \u2208 J(Q0 (S)), for all g \u2208 G. Since dimQ J(Q0 (S)) \u2264 1 this implies that |G| = 1.\nThis finishes the proof.\nRecall that a finite group is said to be a Higman group if it is either abelian of exponent dividing\n4 or 6 or a Hamiltonian 2-group. These are precisely the finite groups G so that U(ZG) is finite (see\nfor example [11]). By Cn we denote the cyclic group of order n. Put S3 the symmetric group of\ndegree 3, D4 the dihedral group of order 8, Q12 the quaternion group of order 12 and C4 \u22ca C4 the\nsemi-direct product where C4 acts non-trivially. These four groups are precisely those non-abelian\nfinite groups G so that QG has the hyperbolic property. It turns out that U(ZG) has a free subgroup\nof rank 2 that is of finite index 2 ([4]). From Dirichlet's Unit it follows that the only finite abelian\ngroups H with QH hyperbolic are C5 , C8 and C12 . These are the non-trivial finite abelian groups\nH with U(ZH) having an infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index. Also recall that a null semigroup\nis a non-trivial semigroup with zero in which the product of any two elements is the zero element\n\u03b8. Of course such a semigroup is 0-simple if it has only one non-zero element. Finally, if a principal\nfactor of a finite semigroup S is of the form G0 , for some group G, then, we simply say that this\nprincipal factor is isomorphic with the group G.\nWe are now ready to prove our main result which, together with [3, Theorem 4.8], completes the\nclassification of the finite semigroups S whose contracted semigroup algebra Q0 S has the hyperbolic\nproperty. As said in the introduction, only the case of semi-simple semigroups has to be dealt with.\nHowever, because of Lemma 2.3, the proof works for all finite semigroups. So for this reason and\n\n3\n\n\fbecause of complenetess' sake, we give a complete proof.\nTheorem 2.4 Let S be a finite semigroup (with zero). The contracted semigroup algebra Q0 S has\nthe hyperbolic property if and only if all principal factors of S, except possibly one, say K, are\nHigman groups, and K is isomorphic to one of the following simple semigroups:\n1. a null semigroup.\n2. M0 ({1}, 1, 2, P ), with P =\n3. M0 ({1}, 2, 2, P ) with P \u2208\n\n\u0012\n\n\u001a\u0012\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n.\n0\n1\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n1\n,\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n\u0013\u001b\n.\n\n4. C5 , C8 , or C12\n5. S3 , D4 , Q12 , or C4 \u22ca C4 .\nProof. Let Sn = {\u03b8} \u2282 Sn\u22121 \u2282 * * * \u2282 S1 = S be a principal series of S. So, the Rees factors\nSi /Si+1 , with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, are the non-trivial principal factors of S. Each of these either is a null\nsemigroup or a Rees Matrix semigroup M0 (Gi , mi , ni ; Pi ), with Gi a finite group.\nFirst assume that Q0 (S) is semisimple. It is well known (see for example [10, Theorem 14.24])\nthat this occurs precisely when ni = mi and Pi is invertible in Mni (QG), for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1\nn\u22121\nand it follows that Q0 S \u223c\nQ0 (Si /Si+1 ). So, Q0 S is hyperbolic if and only if each Q0 (Si /Si+1 )\n= \u2295i=1\nhas the hyperbolic property. From Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 2.3 we obtain that all ni \u2264 2 and at\nmost one of them, say ni0 , equals 2. Furthermore, if the latter occurs then Si0 /Si0 +1 is of the type\ndescribed in 3. For all other indices i, we have that ni = 1 and ZGi must have finitely many units.\nHence Gi is a Higman group. If, on the other hand, all ni = 1 then all ZGi have finite unit group\nexcept possibly one which (by the comments before the Theorem) is then of the type given in 4. or\n5. In the former case QS0 is a sum of division rings. In the latter case there is a simple component\nof the type M2 (Q). This finishes the proof if Q0 S is semisimple.\nSecond, assume Q0 S has the hyperbolic property but not semi-simple. Choose the smallest\nindex i0 such that the ideal Q0 Si0 +1 of Q0 S has no nilpotent elements. Note that i0 > 1. As Q0 Si0\nis an ideal of Q0 S with trivial Jacobson radical, Corollary 2.2 yields that Q0 S \u223c\n= Q0 Si0 \u2295 Q0 (S/Si0 ).\nAgain using Theorem 2.1 we obtain that Q0 Si0 is hyperbolic and a direct sum of division algebras\nof which the unit group of an order is finite. So, as above, the principal factors of Si0 are all\nHigman groups. So Q0 (S/Si0 ) has the hyperbolic property and is not semisimple. Hence, to prove\nthe necessity of the conditions, we may assume that i0 = n \u2212 1.\nSuppose Sn\u22121 is a null semigroup then Q0 Sn\u22121 \u2286 J(Q0 S) and thus, because of the dimension\nof the radical, we have equality. Again, by Theorem 2.1, we then also have that Q0 S/Q0 Sn\u22121 \u223c\n=\nQ0 (S/Sn\u22121 ) is semisimple and hyperbolic with finitely many units in an order. So, all principal\nfactors Si /Si+1 , with 1 \u2265 i > n \u2212 1 are Higman groups, as desired.\nNext, suppose Sn\u22121 is not a null semigroup. Because of Lemma 2.3 we get that Sn\u22121 is as\ndescribed in 2. So Q0 Sn\u22121 /J(Q0 Sn\u22121 ) \u223c\n= Q and Q0 S/J(Q0 S) \u223c\n= Q \u2295 Q0 S/Sn\u22121 . Theorem 2.1 then\nagain yields that Q0 (S/Sn\u22121 ) is a sum of division rings with finitely many units in an order. So,\nall principal factors Si /Si+1 , with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 2, are Higman groups. This finishes the proof of the\nnecessity.\nConversely, suppose that the factors of the principal series Sn = {\u03b8} \u2282 Sn\u22121 \u2282 * * * \u2282 S1 = S of\nS are of the types described and that Si0 /Si0 +1 is the exceptional factor. If this principal factor is\n4\n\n\fof type 3. then Q0 S is semisimple and the result follows from the first part of the proof. So, assume\nSi0 /Si0 +1 is of the type 1. or 2. Now, Si0 +1 is a union of groups and therefore Q0 Si0 +1 is semisimple\nand thus has an identity. Moreover, Q0 S \u223c\n= Q0 Si0 +1 \u2295 Q0 (S/Si0 +1 ) and, by the semisimple part of\nthe proof, an order in Q0 Si0 +1 has finitely many units. So, we only need to verify that Q0 (S/Si0 +1 ) is\nhyperbolic. By the assumptions and Corollary 2.3, we know that J(Q0 (Si0 /Si0 +1 ) is of dimension\none and Q0 (Si0 /Si0 +1 )/J(Q0 (Si0 /Si0 +1 )) \u223c\n= Q. The assumptions also imply that Q0 (S/Si ) is a\ndirect sum of division rings. Hence, Q0 (S/Si0 +1 )/J(Q0 (Si0 /Si0 +1 )) \u223c\n= Q \u2295 Q0 (S/Si0 +1 ) is a direct\nsum of division rings with only finitely many units in an order. Therefore, Q0 S has the hyperbolic\nproperty.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. H. Clifford, G. B.
