Many 1D quantum systems, both fermionic and bosonic, have low energy behaviour of a quantum Luttinger liquid (LL) [1].\nNo matter how complex is the underlying microscopic\nHamiltonian, the effective quadratic LL Hamiltonian has\nonly two parameters c and K, where c is a speed of its\ngapless excitations. In particular, LL description also applies to quasi-1D ultracold atom gases. For instance, it\napplies to a free Bose gas [2] and to bosons in a field\nof an optical lattice [3]. In the case of the free Bose\ngas, the LL parameters can be related\nof the\nq to thoseq\n\u03bam\n\u03ba\ngas in the following way [2]: K =\n\u03c13 , c =\n\u03c1m ,\n\nwhere m is the mass of a boson, \u03c1 density, \u03ba compressibility, and ~ = 1. In particular, LL also arises\nin the system of bosons interacting via contact interactions, where [10, 13]: K = 1 + \u03b34 , c = vF (1 \u2212 \u03b34 ) .\nHere \u03b3 = mg/~2 \u03c1 is interaction strength, with g being\nthe contact interaction's strength, and \u03c1 is linear density\nof particles. For \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e we obtain a Tonks-Girardeau\ngas [4] that was realized in the experiment of Kinoshita\net al. [5]. Of special interest is a Bose gas in an optical\nlattice described by a Bose-Hubbard (BH) model\nHBH = \u2212J\n\nX\ni\n\n(a\u2020i+1 ai + H.c.) +\n\nU X \u2020 \u2020\na a ai ai . (1)\n2 i i i\n\nIts experimental realisation has been achieved e.g. in\nRefs. [6, 7]. When the ratio J/U in (1) is being varied,\nthis model exhibits a quantum phase transition between\nthe Mott insulator phase and the superfluid phase. For\ninteger density we have Mott insulator pools in the \u03bc \u2212 J\nphase diagram surrounded by the superfluid phase, see\nFigure 1. The phase transition is of a commensurateto-incommensurate type apart from situations where the\ninteger density is kept fixed and the system undergoes a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. These\nphase transitions can be described in terms of LL with\n\nK = 1 for commensurate - incommensurate transition\nand K = 21 for BKT transition [3, 9]. The zero-gap superfluid phase can be also mapped to a LL Hamiltonian,\nand any transitions therein, driven by changing the ratio\nJ/U , map to changes in the parameters c and K of the\nLL model.\n\nFIG. 1: (color online). The phase diagram of a BoseHubbard model (1). The superfluid regime, including the\nMott insulator-superfluid boundary, has description in terms\nof the Luttinger liquid and any trajectory in the parameter\nspace of the BH model maps to a trajectory in the c\u2212K plane\nof parameters of the Luttinger liquid.\n\nThe ultracold gases are well isolated from their environment and it is easy to manipulate their Hamiltonian in time. Therefore, they can simulate dynamics of\nisolated quantum many-body systems driven by a timedependent Hamiltonian, see Ref. [10] for reviews. In a\ntypical experiment dedicated to the dynamics, a parameter in a Hamiltonian is suddenly switched between an\ninitial and final value. However, even in a generic experiment, not dedicated the dynamics, a system is often\n\n\f2\nmanipulated by continuously turning its parameter from\nan initial to a desired final value in a \"quench\" time \u03c4Q\n(here we use the word \"quench\" too for historical reasons [11]). The idea is to prepare the system in a simple\nground state of the initial Hamiltonian and then drive\nit adiabatically to the desired ground state of the final\nHamiltonian. Unfortunately, this ideal adiabatic quantum state preparation must fail when the system is gapless either at an isolated quantum critical point or in a\ngapless phase [10, 12]. This failure can be quantified by\ne.g. excitation energy which is argued to decay with a\npower of the quench time \u03c4Q [10, 12], often in accordance\nwith the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism [11]. An example of this scaling was measured recently in a smooth\nquench from the Mott insulator to superfluid [7] and in\nthe Dicke quantum phase transition [8].\nMost theoretical work has been devoted to quenches\nacross a quantum critical point [10], where the scaling is\ndetermined by its critical exponents [11]. Recently, there\nhas also been research on sudden interaction quenches in\nLL [13, 14]. Since most experiments begin from BoseEinstein condensation, much of the (supposedly adiabatic) manipulation is done in the gapless superfluid\nphase of a Bose-condensed system. With this motivation\nin mind, in the following we consider a smooth quench\nof parameters in a LL which is a universal low energy\neffective model for gapless (quasi-)1D quantum systems.\nLuttinger liquid (LL).- LL Hamiltonian is\nZ L\nh\ni\n1\n2\ndx K \u03a02 + K \u22121 (\u2202x \u03a6) , (2)\nH = c\n2 0\nwhere \u03a0 and \u03a6 obey bosonic commutation relations,\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX \u0012 |k| \u00131/2 k\n(3)\ne\u2212ikx a\u2020k \u2212 a\u2212k ,\n\u03a0(x) =\n2L\n|k|\nk6=0\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX \u0012 |k| \u00131/2 1\n\u03a6(x) = \u2212i\ne\u2212ikx a\u2020k + a\u2212k , (4)\n2L\nk\nk6=0\n\nand assume that the state of the system is a Bogoliubov vacuum for \u03b3k 's. In this Heisenberg picture we\nk\nhave i da\ndt = [ak , Heff ]. Substituting Eq.

The amplitudes ak (s), bk (s) satisfy |ak |2 \u2212 |bk |2 = 1\nand initial conditions ak (\u2212\u221e) = 1, bk (\u2212\u221e) = 0.\nAverage number of quasiparticles of momentum k excited in the final state is nk = |bk (\u221e)|2 . It depends on k\nonly through the product cf \u03c4Q |k| defining a length scale\n\na\u2020k\n\nand ak and\nare bosonic annihilation and creation operators. A quench of one of the parameters in, say, the BH\nmodel (1) along a path in its superfluid phase, see Fig. 1,\nmaps to a quench in the LL model (2) along a path in the\nc \u2212 K plane of its two parameters. This map is accurate\nprovided the quench does not excite high energy states\nbeyond the low-energy LL model.\nIn terms of ak and a\u2020k the LL Hamiltonian (2) reads\nX\nH =\nc|k| \u00d7\nk6=0\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\nK + K \u22121\n2\n\n\u0013\n\na\u2020k ak \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nK \u2212 K \u22121\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\nak a\u2212k + h.c.\n(5)\n.\n2\n\nFor time-dependent K(t) and c(t) we make a Bogoliubov\ntransformation\n\u2020\nak = uk (t) \u03b3k + v\u2212k (t)\u2217 \u03b3\u2212k\n\n(6)\n\n\u03be = cf \u03c4Q\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is the shortest wavelength of excited phonons.\nWhen nk decays with |k| sufficiently fast, then average\nlinear density of excited quasiparticles scales with \u03c4Q like\nnex =\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\n\u2212\u039b\n\ndk\n\u22121\nnk \u223c \u03c4Q\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\nwhile the more directly measurable excitation energy\ndensity scales like\nZ \u039b\ndk\n\u22122\n\u03b5=\ncf |k| nk \u223c \u03c4Q\n(14)\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u039b\nprovided that \u03be \u22121 \u226a \u039b.

(14), except case (2) when it logarithmically\ndiverges with the cut-off. The discontinuous time derivative of the linear ramp (18) is probing non-universal high\nenergy excitations beyond the range of validity of the effective low-energy LL (2). For the linear ramp the LL\nis not a self-consistent approximation and the scaling of\nthe excitation energy with the ramp time \u03c4Q , if any, can\n\u22122\n. A non-universal exbe different from the universal \u03c4Q\nponent was observed in numerical simulations of linear\nramps in the BH model [14].\nCORRELATIONS\n\nHere we consider three examples of quenches around a\nK0 : a smooth tanh quench\nlog K (1) (s)/K0 = A tanh(s) ,\n\n(17)\n\nThe excitation does not change the quasi-long-range\ncharacter of correlation functions. For example, after a\nquench is completed a correlation function for density\n\n\f4\nfluctuations smeared over distances longer than interparticle distance \u03b4\u03c1(x) = \u03c01 \u2202x \u03a6(x) reads\nC(R) = h\u03b4\u03c1(x + R)\u03b4\u03c1(x)i =\nZ \u039b\n\u221a\n|k|dk ikR\nKf\ne\n[1 + 2nk + 2 nk cos \u03c6k (t)] ,(24)\n3\n4\u03c0\n\u2212\u039b\nwhere \u03c6k (t) = 2cf t|k| + \u03c60 (\u03be|k|). In the ground state,\nK\nwhen nk = 0, its tail decays like Cf (R) = \u2212 2\u03c03fR2 for\nR \u226b 1/\u039b. The excitations nk > 0 add a correction\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\nKf\n2cf t \u2212 R\n2cf t + R\nR\n+G\n+G\n.\nF\n\u03be2\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\u03be\n(25)\nHere F (z) and G(z) are real functions originating from\n\u221a\nthe nk and nk terms in Eq. (24) respectively .\nThere is analogy to the quasiparticle horizon effect [15].\nThe G-terms in (25) describe shock waves that originate\nfrom correlated pairs of quasiparticles with momenta \u00b1k\nexcited during a quench whose separation grows like 2cf t.\nTheir width \u2243 \u03be is the shortest length on which quasiparticles excited in time \u03c4Q can be localized in space. The\nF -term in (25) is an additive correction to Cf (R) that\nremains inside the quasiparticle horizon, R \u226a 2cf t, after\nthe shock waves go away. When n0 > 0 in (15), then a\ntail of the remaining correlator is C(R) = (1+2n0)Cf (R)\nfor R \u226b \u03be. The R\u22122 tail of the ground state correlator\nis amplified by a factor (1 + 2n0 ) = 21 (Kf /Ki + Ki /Kf ).\nWhen n0 = 0 in (15), as for e.g. the shake (19,20), then\nthe F term decays faster than R\u22122 and the tail of C(R)\nis the same as in the ground state: C(R) = Cf (R) for\n\u03be \u226a R \u226a 2cf t.\nDespite all its interesting physics, the additive correction (25) does not cut the algebraic R\u22122 -tail of the correlator in the quasi-long-range ordered ground state. This\ncontrasts with the KZ mechanism where correlations after a quench from a disordered to an ordered phase decay\nexponentially [10].\nQUENCH AT FINITE TEMPERATURE\n\nSince real experiments are done at finite temperature,\nwe generalize to finite T , where the excitation spectrum\nreads\n\u0001\n.\n(26)\nnk (T ) = nBE\n+ nk 1 + 2nBE\nk\nk\n\nHere nk = |bk (\u221e)|2 is the excitation spectrum at T =\n0, and nBE\n= [exp(ci |k|/T ) \u2212 1]\u22121 is the initial thermal\nk\ndistribution which can be also reinterpreted as a final\n\u22121\nthermal distribution nBE\nwith\nk = [exp(cf |k|/Tf ) \u2212 1]\nTf =\n\ncf\nT .\nci\n\n(27)\n\nThis temperature rescaling is the only effect in the adiabatic limit \u03c4Q \u2192 \u221e when nk \u2192 0.\n\nHere we are more interested in the non-adiabatic excitation above this thermal background:\n\u0001\n.\n(28)\nnk (T ) \u2212 nBE\n= nk 1 + 2nBE\nk\nk\n\nWhen compared with the bare nk at T = 0, it is amplified by a Bose enhancement factor 1 + 2nBE\nk making the\nexcitation more significant than at T = 0. For relatively\nfast quenches, with \u03c4Q T \u226a 1, the distribution nk extends\nup to |k| \u2243 \u03be \u22121 where the enhancement 1 + 2nBE\n\u2248 1.\nk\nConsequently, the non-adiabatic excitation energy density \u03b5(T ) is roughly same as at T = 0. In contrast, for\nrelatively slow quenches with\n\u03c4Q T \u226b 1 ,\n\n(29)\n\nthe k \u2192 0 singularity of the Bose enhancement factor\nhas more qualitative consequences. In this regime the\nnon-adiabatic excitation energy density is\n\u03b5(T ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2248\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\u2212\u039b\n\u039b\n\u2212\u039b\n\n\u0001\ndk\ncf |k| nk 1 + 2nBE\nk\n2\u03c0\n2Tf\ndk\ncf |k| nk\n= 2Tf nex , (30)\n2\u03c0\ncf |k|\n\nwhere nex is the density of excited quasiparticles at T = 0\nin (13). The energy is not only larger than its T = 0\ncounterpart (14), but its decay with \u03c4Q is also less steep:\n\u22121\n\u03b5(T ) \u223c \u03c4Q\n\n(31)\n\n\u22122\nfrom (13,30) instead of the \u03c4Q\nat T = 0 in (14).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe derived universal dynamical exponents for the scaling of excitation energy with a quench time when the\nquench is slow and smooth enough not to excite beyond\nthe quadratic Luttinger liquid model. Due to the singularity of the Bose enhancement factor, the exponents are\ndifferent at zero and finite temperature. In both regimes\nthey can be used to test the low energy LL description\nof quasi-1D ultracold atomic systems.\nAcknowledgments.
