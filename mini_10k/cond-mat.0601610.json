In particular, we compute a self-consistent correction to the Kolmogorov exponent and find\nthat for our model it is zero. We find that the higher order structure functions diverge for orders\nlarger than a certain threshold, as theorized in some recent work. The significance of the results for\nthe statistical theory of homogeneous turbulence is reviewed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1941 Kolmogorov [1] formulated his famous scaling theory of the inertial range in turbulence, according\nto which the second order structure function, i.e., the function S2 (r) =< ((u(x + r) \u2212 u(x))2 >, scales as\n(\u01ebr)2/3 , where x, x+r are points in a turbulent flow field, u is the component of the velocity in the direction\nof r, \u01eb is the mean rate of energy dissipation, r is the length |r| of r, and the brackets denote an average.\nA Fourier transform yields the Kolmogorov-Obukhov inertial range spectrum E(k) = C\u01eb2/3 k \u22125/3 , where\nC is a constant and k is the wave number [2]. These results are the lynchpins of turbulence theory yet\nuncertainty lingers as to their general validity and as to the details of the derivation. Subsequently (\nsee e.g. [3]) it was claimed that this scaling result generalizes to structure functions of any order, i.e.,\nto Sp (r) =< ((u(x + r) \u2212 u(x))p >=(\u01ebr)p/3 for any p > 0, but note that Kolmogorov and Obukhov\nthemselves never went that far; Kolmogorov in [4] gave only the further result for p = 3.\nShortly after the publication of this theory, Landau [5] challenged its derivation on the ground that\nthe rate of energy dissipation is intermittent, i.e., spatially inhomogenous, and cannot be treated as a\nconstant. This observation fits in with the experimental observation that for p > 3 the exponents are\n1\n\n\fsmaller than the values given by the extended Kolmogorov theory and, and it is also often claimed for\nthe p = 2 the experimental value of the Kolmogorov-Obukhov exponent is larger than the prediction of\nthis scaling theory. Kolmogorov and Obukhov themselves produced a \"corrected\" theory [6], [7], and the\ncurrent belief is that the theory has to be supplemented by \"intermittency corrections\"; much effort has\nbeen expended on the calculation of these corrections (see e.g. [8, 3]).\nA different analysis of possible corrections to the Kolmogorov exponents has been offered by Barenblatt\nand Chorin in [9, 10]. The structure functions depend on the Reynolds number R (for a definition of\nR suitable for the present case see [11]), a bulk length scale L, and the mean rate of energy dissipation\n\u01eb. Dimensional analysis yields Sp = (\u01ebr)p/3 \u03a6p (r/L, R), where \u03a6p is an unknown dimensionless function\nof two large arguments. If one makes a complete similarity assumption (see [12]), one finds \u03a6p \u223c C for\nlarge arguments, and one recovers the Kolmogorov exponents above, but other assumptions are possible\nand indeed natural. In particular, an analogy with a successful scaling theory for turbulent boundary\nlayers [13], [14], leads to the assumption \u03a6p = Cp (R)(r/L)(\u03b1p /lnR) , where \u03b1p is a constant and Cp (R) is a\nfunction of the Reynolds number R. This yields structure functions Sp proportional to rp/3+\u03b1p /lnR , i.e.,\nexponents that depend on R, and maybe even more important, a proportionality constant that depends\non R and may well diverge as R \u2192 \u221e for p large enough. As pointed out in [13], the dependence on\n1/lnR is an assumption, and in reality may be weaker yet; such dependence could be hard to detect in\nexperimental data.\nThis analysis is quite compatible with the Landau observation regarding intermittency, as was already pointed out in [14]: Turbulent flow is intrinsically intermittent, and indeed in the limit of infinite\nR, extremely intermittent, in the sense that the bulk of the vorticity occupies a negligible fraction of\nthe available volume [15]; this is a dominant fact about turbulence, and the notion of \"intermittency\ncorrections\" is no more meaningful than a notion of \"turbulence corrections\" to turbulent flow. However,\n\n2\n\n\fat finite R viscosity reduces the intermittency and the scaling has to be corrected for \"intermittency\nreductions\" that depend on R. In related work [16], Barenblatt and Chorin made numerical estimates\non the basis of an approximate theory of turbulence and came to the conclusion that, as R increases, the\nstructure functions for p \u2265 4 diverge; similar conclusions had been reached by P. Constantin (personal\ncommunication) through mathematical considerations and by Mandelbrot [17] by a geometrical similarity\nargument. Thus indeed Cp (R) would diverge as R increases for p \u2265 4.\nIn the absence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations these various theories can only be checked\nby data from experiments, and this seems to be difficult at present. It occurred to us to interrogate\nfurther the available data about the inertial range by building a stochastic computer model of the inertial\nrange, compatible with well-accepted and reproducible data about their skewness (indicating the level of\nintermittency), and then examine the resulting structure functions. The field we construct is obviously\nnot unique; however, any model that satisfies constraints imposed by the data is highly instructive, and\nindicates what possibilities are worthy of further study. The results are striking enough to open new\nvistas for theory, as we discuss in the concluding section.\nWe thus construct on the computer a one-dimensional Gaussian velocity field with a power-law, then\nmodify it so that the velocity differences assume the skewnesses presented in Batchelor's book [18] on the\nbasis of the data in [19]; the power law will be either the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum or a modification\nthat satisfies other constraints (see below). We use a one-dimensional model so that we can perform the\ncalculations with sufficent accuracy, and think that this model is sufficient to carry our conclusions. We\nthen calculate, when possible, the higher-order structure functions. The data in [18, 19] are tabulated\nthere for various Reynolds numbers; we take the data that correspond to the largest R = 42200; our model\nhas a power law for all wave numbers and is thus inviscid. Note that by modern standards this value of\nR is not very large; we thus assume that the skewness does not vary drastically as R increases further.\n\n3\n\n\fWe first present the technical aspects of the construction, then the results, then provide a discussion.\n\n2\n\nBuilding a Model\n\nWe first explain how to sample effectively a homogenous Gaussian velocity field with a given spectrum.\nOur basic tool is a construction due to Elliott et al. [20, 21]. A homogeneous Gaussian random field is\ndetermined by its second order means:\n\n< u(x) >= 0,\n< u(x + \u2206x)u(x) >=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u22122\u03c0ikx E(k)dk.\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe spectral representation of the Gaussian random field u is\n\nu(x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ne2\u03c0ikx E 1/2 (k)dw(k),\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere w is a a Wiener process. Expand dw in a complete orthonormal series \u03c6m :\n\ndw(k) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b3m \u03c6m (k)dk,\n\n(3)\n\nm=1\n\nwhere the \u03b3m form a sequence of independent random Gaussian variables. By substituting (3) into Eq.\n(2) we find:\n\nu(x) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b3m cm (x),\n\n(4)\n\nm\n\nwhere the coefficients cm (x) are:\n\ncm (x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ne2\u03c0ikx E 1/2 (k)\u03c6m (k)dk \u2261 F \u22121 [E 1/2 \u03c6m ](x),\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fand F is the Fourier transform. Elliott et al. proposed to use as basis of the decomposition, Fourier\ntransforms of wavelets based on the Meyer wavelet; these wavelets are generated from the Meyer mother\nwavelet \u03c8(k) by the wavelet relation:\n\n\u03c8mn (x) = 2\u2212m/2 \u03c8(2\u2212m x \u2212 n),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the index m refers to different scales (octaves) and n to different dilations. Using this prescription,\nEq. (4) can be represented as,\n\nu(x) =\n\nXX\nm\n\n\u03b3mn cmn (x)\n\nn\n\n1/2\ncmn (x) = F \u22121 [Em\n\u03c6](2\u2212m x \u2212 n),\n\n(7)\n\n1/2\n\nwhere Em (k) = 2\u2212m/2 E 1/2 (2\u2212m k). In the particular case of the Kolmogorov-Obukhov energy spectrum\nE(k) \u223c k \u22125/3 , the Fourier transform of the cmn coefficients represented in Eq. (7) becomes:\n\n(F cmn )(k) = 2\u2212m/2 | 2\u2212m/2 k |\n\n\u22125/6\n\n\u03c8mn (k).\n\n(8)\n\nSimilar formulas are obtained for every power-law spectrum.\nDefining fm (2\u2212m x \u2212 n) = F \u22121 (2\u2212m/2 | 2\u2212m/2 k |\n\n\u22125/6\n\n\u03c8mn (k)), the representation of the field given in\n\nEq.(7) is:\n\nu(x) =\n\nXX\nm\n\nn\n\n\u03b3mn fm (2\u2212m x \u2212 n).\n\n(9)\n\nThe use of the summation (9) requires a truncation in m and n that preserves accuracy. The truncation\nuses the spatial decay of the functions fm (see [20]). It is convenient to center the summation around the\nterm with the smallest (in magnitude) value of the argument (2\u2212m x \u2212 n). This can be done by defining\n5\n\n\ffor each term m of the outer sum the index n\u0304m = \u230a2\u2212m x\u230b and shifting indexes in the inner sum to\nn\u2032 = n \u2212 n\u0304m . The parameter m governs the scale, the truncation in m defines a frequency range, which\ncan be modified by rescaling the distance x if necessary, so as to obtain a numerically convenient range\n\u2212M \u2264 m \u2264 0. The truncation in n (the number of dilations) defines the region where the support of fm\nis concentrated; we suppose that this range lies between a pair of integers -N and N . We can then write:\n\nu(x) =\n\n0\nX\n\nN\nX\n\nm=\u2212M n=\u2212N +1\n\n\u03b3m,n\u0304m +n fm (2\u2212m x \u2212 \u230a2\u2212m x\u230b \u2212 n).\n\n(10)\n\nMore information can be found in [20, 22]. A technical issue concerning the generation of Gaussian random\nvariables should be pointed out. The number of random variables needed to sample the field scales as\n2M+1 x, and this imposes severe demands on the storage in the computer. To overcome this problem,\na reversible pseudorandom number generation is necessary to sample \u03b3mn . Simple linear congruential\ngenerators with moduli around 231 can exhaust their period in few minutes in a conventional PC, and the\nresulting poor distribution of the samples can dramatically bias simulation results for sample sizes much\nsmaller than the period length. To overcome this problem, we used reversible multiple linear congruential\ngenerators with many long streams and substreams [23] that provide periods of approximately 2191 .\nWe now explain how to modify the construction of the preceding section so as to impose on the\nsampled velocity field the non-Gaussian characteristics observed in the experimental data.\nWe introduce non-Gaussianity into the numerical experiment via the coefficients \u03b3m . In the previous\n\u2032\n\u2032\ns were Gaussian variables; now we construct a new distribution for the \u03b3m\ns that\nparagraphs the \u03b3m\n\npreserves the mean and variance of the original Gaussian distribution but with a skewness different from\n0. The skewness of a randon variable \u03b7 is < \u03b7 3 > / < \u03b7 2 >3/2 ; it is zero for a Gaussian variable. We\ndescribe a transformation that maps a Gaussian variable on a non-Gaussian variable with the same mean\nand variance but with a prescribed, non-zero skewness controlled by a single parameter.

The\n\nExperimental results for the velocity field were obtained by Stewart in 1951 [19], and are also presented\nin [18], see Figure 2. The skewness varies with scale, and this is easy to incorporate into our wavelet\nrepresentation as the various wavelets describe motion on different scales. The parameter a(r) has been\nobtained by inversion of the formula (13) for values of c3 (r) corresponding to the experiment for the\nhighest value of R reported in [18].\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nHaving constructed these fields, i.e., written a computer program that samples them, we proceeded to\ncalculate their properties by Monte Carlo; we now list some of the results.\n1. First, we noticed that if the second order structure has the Kolmogorov form, and if the field\nis Gaussian, then all the structure functions obey the Kolmogorov scaling. This is quite natural and\nobvious, and was well known to Kolmogorov (personal communication by G.I. Barenblatt), but we had\nnever seen it stated in print. The obvious converses are not necessarily true.\n9\n\n\f2. It is \"almost\" a theorem that the third order structure function scales like r (see [4] as well as[15, 8];\nall one has to assume is an extremely likely bound on the rate of blow-up of the dissipation as the Reynolds\nnumber grows. It is natural to ask then what form must the second order structure function take if the\nthird order scales as r and the skewness is as observed. Let the second order structure function scale\nas r2/3+\u03b1 and the third order structure scale as r\u03be3 ; in Figure 3 we plot the computed values of \u03be3 as\na function of \u03b1. The relationship between them can be approximated by \u03be3 = 1 \u2212 23 \u03b1. The value of \u03b1\nshould be the one that yields \u03be3 = 1; thus, within the errors in our sampling scheme, one can construct a\nvelocity field with the second order structure function with the Kolmogorov exponent, the correct third\norder exponent, and a realistic intermittency; This shows that a correction to the Kolmogorov-Obukhov\nexponent is not imposed simply by the presence of intermittency (although we cannot, of course, exclude\nthat it is imposed by other constraints). Note that this analysis simply confirms that the analysis in\nKolmogorov's paper [4] remains valid in the presence of a realistic skewness.\n3. The next question is maybe the most significant: Suppose the second order structure function has\nthe Kolmogorov-Obukhov form and the skewness is as observed, what can one say about the higher order\nstructure functions? When we tried to sample these higher-order functions as above, we found that the\nvariance of the Monte-Carlo results was very large and did not go down as rapidly as one may expect as\nthe number of trials went up, leading us to suspect that some moments of the velocity field diverged.\nWe therefore plotted the data for the variable x = S1 (r) = |\u2206u| at fixed values of r in log-log scale (see\nFigure 4). The data for the non-Gaussian field present a power-law tail that clearly contrasts with the\nexponential decay of the Gaussian field. To estimate the form of the decay we construct the cumulative\ndensity function (CDF) P (x > X) of the the variable x = S1 (r). We use CDF's rather than the density\nfunctions themselves because they fluctuate less. The behaviour of the CDFs reveals the convergence,\nor lack thereof, of the structure function moments.

The CDF for the Gaussian field presents an exponential decay compatible with the finiteness of\nmoments of any order. However the CDF for the velocity differences in the non-Gaussian case presents a\npower-law tail whose exponent determines the order of the moments that are finite. The tail of the CDF\nof S1 scales for small values as a power law with exponent \u22122.2 \u00b1 0.01, however, the final part of the CDF,\nwhich contain the relevant information about the decay, is well described by an exponent \u22123.3 \u00b1 0.05\nwithin our experimental error. This means that the PDF will decay approximately as a power law with\nexponent \u22124.3 \u00b1 0.05 and then produces a threshold for the higher order structure functions to converge\nat order p \u2248 3.3. We therefore conclude that, within our model, the structure functions of order \u2265 3.3 do\nnot exist. In Figure 5 we plotted the CDF's for several values of r, to show that the behavior we describe\nis at least approximately independent of r when r is small.\nThis does not of course show that the moments of the true velocity field in turbulence fail to exist,\n\n11\n\n\fCDF\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.0001\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\nCDF\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.0001\n\n|\u2206u|\n\nFigure 5: Cumulative distribution functions of S1 obtained from a Gaussian field (Top), and a nonGaussian field, at several separations.\nbut only that the data contain a strong enough deviation from Gaussianity for these moments not to\nexist.\nFinally, we would like to provide a short discussion of sampling errors. All the data presented have\nbeen obtained by the least squares method, except the data for the final part of the tail in Figures 4\nand 5, where we have also applied the maximum likelihood method to reduce the estimation error of the\nexponent [25], within a framework suggested in [24]. With 95% confidence the errors are comparable\nwith the thickness of the lines drawn in all cases. The regions of the sampling where aliasing problems\nappear in the FFT have been discarded in the analysis.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nDespite the non-uniqueness of the fields we have constructed, some conclusions can be drawn from the\ncomputations above; in particular:\n(1) The original Kolmogorov-Obukhov \u22125/3 spectrum is consistent with the \"exact\" scaling of the\n12\n\n\fthird order structure function even in the presence of intermittency; intermittency does not necessarily\nrequire that the spectrum be modified. As long as one considers only the lower order structure functions\noriginally considered by Kolmogorov and Obukhov, our model provides no reason to modify their original\nscaling.\n(2) The Kolmogorov scaling of the structure functions and its extensions is exact at all orders for\nGaussian fields; however, the data for real flows reveal enough departure from Gaussianity for structure\nfunctions of order higher than a threshold larger than three to diverge as the Reynolds number grows;\nif this happens, the higher-order exponents become strongly dependent on the Reynolds number, their\nscaling laws depend on the Reynolds number, and the proposals of Barenblatt, Chorin, and Prostokishin\nbecome eminently reasonable, as well as those of Mandelbrot and Constantin. Thus, within the limitations\nof our model, the complete similarity assumption, on which the extension of the Kolmogorov scaling rests,\nfails above the threshold but not below it; when it fails it should be replaced by an incomplete similarity\nassumption as in the papers quoted above.\n\n5\n\nacknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Prof. G.I.
