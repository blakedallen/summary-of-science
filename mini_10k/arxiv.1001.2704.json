Introduction: General structure of subtraction schemes\nIn higher order calculations, the cancellation of infrared singularities is generally treated by\nthe introduction of an infinitesimal regulator, eg in the form of a finite mass for the massless gauge\nboson, or by lowering the dimension D of the respective phase space integrals to D = 4 \u2212 2 \u03b5 . This\nway, the analytic cancellation of the respective divergent terms for fully inclusive variables after\nphase space integration is straightforward; however, numerical implementations of terms containing small regulators prove to be challenging. In subtraction schemes, this problem is circumvented\nby the introduction of local counterterms, which mimic the behaviour of the squared real emission\nmatrix elements in the singular regions; adding back the respective one particle integrated counterparts to the virtual contributions results in finite integrands for both real emission and virtual\ncontribution phase space. Symbolically, this is given by\ne\n\n\u03c3 NLO = \u03c3 Born + \u03c3 virt + \u03c3 real = \u03c3 Born + \u03c3 virt + \u03c3 A + \u03c3 real \u2212 \u03c3 A ,\nwhere\n\"\n\n(1.1)\n#\n\n\u03c3 Born + \u03c3 virt + \u03c3 =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n) + \u2211 Vi |MBorn |2 ,\nd\u0393m |MBorn |2 + 2 Re (MBorn Mvirt\n\n\u03c3 real \u2212 \u03c3 A =\n\nZ\n\nd\u0393m+1 |Mreal |2 \u2212 \u2211 Di |MBorn |2\n\ne\nA\n\n\"\n\ni\n\n#\n\ni\n\n(1.2)\n\nare the respective m, m + 1 phase space contributions to the total NLO cross section1 . Convolution\nwith jet functions then allows to define differential quanities and guarantees infrared safety of the\nrespective Born contribution. In eq (1.2), the sum goes over all local counterterms needed to match\nthe complete singularity structure of the real emission contribution. For each singular limit, the\nreal emission matrix element factorizes according to\n|Mreal |2 (p) \u2212\u2192 D |MBorn |2 ( p\u0303),\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere D denotes the dipole containing the respective singularity structure. As Mreal and MBorn\nlive in different phase spaces, a mapping of the respective momenta from m + 1 to m particle\nphase space needs to be introduced, which is defined by a mapping function Fmap according to\np\u0303 = Fmap (p). While the complete singularity structure of the limit considered is contained in D,\nboth D and MBorn can depend on the leftover nonsingular parameters of phase space. Di and Vi are\nR\nrelated by Vi = \u03bc 2 \u03b5 d \u03be Di , where the integration measure d \u03be is an effective one particle integral.\nSummarizing, any subtraction scheme needs to fulfill the following requirements:\n\u2022 definition of subtraction terms Di which, following eq (1.3), one by one mimic the behaviour\nof the real emission matrix element in each singular region such that their sum contains the\ncomplete singularity structure of the process,\n\u2022 definition of a mapping Fmap which guarantees total energy momentum conservation as well\nas onshellness of all external particles both before and after the mapping,\nhadronic initial states, an additional collinear counterterm \u03c3 C needs to be added in m particle phase space,\nwhich accounts for contributions already contained in the NLO PDFs.\n1 For\n\n2\n\n\fNagy Soper substraction scheme\n\nTania Robens\n\n\u2022 integration measure d \u03be , with a \"smart\" choice of variables providing optimal singularity\nstructure parametrization.\nIn the following, we will discuss this for our specific scheme, comparing with [1] where appropriate.\n\n2. Scheme setup\nIn the scheme discussed in this report, the NLO subtraction terms are derived from the splitting\nfunctions introduced in [2], and the m + 1 to m phase space mappings needed correspond to the\ninverse of the respective shower m to m + 1 mappings. In the following, we will denote the m + 1\nphase space four vectors by p\u03021 , p\u03022 , ... and m phase space four vectors by p1 , p2 , .... Indices a, b\nwill denote initial state particles; in m + 1 phase space, p\u0302i is the emitter, p\u0302 j the emitted particle, and\np\u0302k the spectator2 . By default, for initial state emissions we set p\u0302i = p\u0302a in all general expressions\nbelow. Equally, we restrict our expressions to subtractions on the parton level and to the massless\ncase; details on convolution with PDFs are given in [2], and the extension to massive particles is in\nthe line of future work.\n2.1 Momentum mapping and integration measure: Initial state\nFor the initial state, the mapping from the m + 1 to the m particle phase space is given by\n!\np\u0302 j * Q\u0302\nb p\u0302l , pb = p\u0302b ,\npa = 1 \u2212\np\u0302a , pl = \u039b(K, K)\n(2.1)\np\u0302a * p\u0302b\n\nwhere the index l goes over all final state particles in the m particle phase space and with\nb = g\u2212\n\u039b(K, K)\n\nb\nb (K + K)\nb\n2K K\n2 (K + K)\n+\n,\nb2\nb2\n(K + K)\nK\n\nb = Q\u0302 \u2212 p\u0302 j . The phase space factorizes according to\nwhere K = pa + pb , Q\u0302 = p\u0302a + p\u0302b , K\n\u0003\n\u0002\nd{ p\u0302, f\u02c6}m+1 g({ p\u0302, f\u02c6}m+1 ) = [d{p, f }m ] d \u03be p g({ p\u0302, f\u02c6}m+1 ),\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere f denotes the flavour and with the D-dimensional integration measure\nd\u03bep =\n\n\u0001\nd D p\u0302 j\n\u03b4+ p\u03022j .\nD\u22121\n(2 \u03c0 )\n\n(2.4)\n\n2.2 Momentum mapping and integration measure: Final state\nFor final state splittings, the initial state momenta remain unchanged: pa = p\u0302a , pb = p\u0302b .\nThe mapping uses all non-emitting particles as one spectator for momentum redistribution. We\nintroduce the additional variables\nP = p\u0302i + p\u0302 j , Q = p\u0302a + p\u0302b ,\n\n2 In\n\nQ2\nP2\n,\na\n=\n,\u03bb =\ny=\n2 P * Q \u2212 P2\n2 P * Q \u2212 P2\n\nq\n\n(1 + y)2 \u2212 4 a y.\n\ncontrast to [1], in our case a spectator only needs to be specified if p\u0302 j denotes a gluon.\n\n3\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fNagy Soper substraction scheme\n\nTania Robens\n\nThe emitting particle is mapped according to\npi =\n\nP\n1\u2212\u03bb +y\n\u2212\nQ.\n\u03bb\n2\u03bb a\n\n(2.6)\n\nAll non-emitting final state particles are mapped using the Lorentz transformation as in eq. (2.2),\nb = Q \u2212 P. Especially, this means that the total number of mappings\nwhere now K = Q \u2212 pi , K\n2\nneeded for a N-jet final state scales as N2 , which reduces scaling3 with respect to [1] by a factor N.\nThe phase space factorization takes a similar form as in the initial state splitting, ie we have again\n\u0003\n\u0002\nd{ p\u0302, f\u02c6}m+1 g({ p\u0302, f\u02c6}m+1 ) = [d{p, f }m ] d \u03be p g({ p\u0302, f\u02c6}m+1 )\n(2.7)\nwhere now\n\nymax\n\nd D p\u0302 j\npi * Q d D p\u0302i\n2\n(\np\u0302\n)\n\u03b4\n\u03b4+ ( p\u03022j )\nd \u03be p = dy \u03b8 (ymax \u2212 y) \u03bb D\u22123\n+\ni\n\u03c0 (2 \u03c0 )D\u22121\n(2 \u03c0 )D\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\u2212\u03bb +y\nD (D)\n\u00d7 (2 \u03c0 ) \u03b4\nQ .\n(2.8)\nP \u2212 \u03bb pi \u2212\n2a\n\u00012\n\u221a\n\u221a\n=\na \u2212 a \u2212 1 can directly be derived from total energy momentum conservation.\n\n2.3 Treatment of interference terms: dipole partitioning functions\n\nDouble poles in splitting functions only arise if the emitted particle is a gluon; in this case,\ninterference terms between different emitters have to be taken into account. In our scheme, we split\nthe collinear and soft parts of the respective spin averaged splitting functions W according to [4]\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\neik\neik\n(2.9)\nW ii \u2212 W ik = W ii \u2212 W ii + W ii \u2212 W ik ,\neik\n\nwhere W ii is the spin-averaged eikonal factor. The second part of the above equation can be then\nexpressed in terms of dipole partitioning functions A\u2032ik [5]\neik\n\nW ii \u2212 W ik = 4 \u03c0 \u03b1s A\u2032ik\n\n\u2212P\u0302ik2\n,\n( p\u0302 j * p\u0302i p\u0302 j * p\u0302k )2\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere P\u0302ik = p\u0302 j * p\u0302i p\u0302k \u2212 p\u0302 j * p\u0302k p\u0302i . Several choices for A\u2032ik have been proposed [5]; all results given\nhere have been obtained using eq (7.12) therein.\n\n3. Example of integrated splitting function: g \u2192 q q\u0304 final state splitting\nFor our scheme, all collinear as well as singular parts of the soft splitting functions have been\ntested; a complete list will be given in [6]. In this section, we give the final state g \u2192 q q\u0304 dipole and\nthe corresponding integrated term as an example, additionally commenting on the limit for m \u2192 2.\nFor a g \u2192 q q\u0304 splitting in the massless case, the spin averaged subtraction term is given by Dgqq\u0304 |MBorn (p)|2 ,\nwith\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 z (1 \u2212 z)\n4 \u03c0 \u03b1s\n1\u2212\nDgqq\u0304 = TR\n,\n(3.1)\ny pi * Q\n1\u2212\u03b5\n3 The\n\nsubtraction scheme in [3] has a scaling similar to our scheme.\n\n4\n\n\fNagy Soper substraction scheme\n\nTania Robens\n\n\u03bb\na\nwhere we introduced the additional variables z = Pj\u00f1 , \u00f1 = 1+y+\n2\u03bb Q \u2212 \u03bb P, and all other variables as\nin eq. (2.5). This subtraction term was derived by squaring the respective final state shower splitting\nfunction in [2]. Momentum mapping is done according to eq. (2.6) and the Lorentz transform with\nthe respective expressions for K, K\u0302. For the integrated splitting function, we rewrite the measure\n(2.8) in terms of the variables introduced above and obtain\np\u0302 \u00f1\n\nd\u03bep =\n\n(2 pi Q)1\u2212\u03b5 d\u03a9d\u22122\ndz dy \u03bb 1\u22122 \u03b5 y\u2212\u03b5 [z (1 \u2212 z)]\u2212\u03b5 \u03b8 (ymax \u2212 y) \u03b8 [z (1 \u2212 z)]\n16 \u03c0 2\n(2 \u03c0 )1\u22122 \u03b5\n\nwhich results in\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u0015\n\u0013\u03b5 \u0014\n16\n2\n2\nV =\u03bc\n\u2212\n+ [(a \u2212 1) ln(a \u2212 1) \u2212 a ln a] .\n\u2212\n3\u03b5\n9\n3\n(3.3)\nAs expected, for m = 2 the above expressions as well as the mapping completely reduce to the\nresult in [1].\nWe want to comment that in our scheme, the most complicated expressions stem from the integration of the interference terms as in eq. (2.10). As all final state particles are mapped using the\nLorentz transform \u039b, the finite parts of the respective subtraction functions need to be evaluated\nnumerically; details will be given in [6].\n2\u03b5\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1s\n1\nd \u03be p D = TR\n2 \u03c0 \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b5 )\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0 \u03bc2\npi Q\n\n4. First results\nAs an example, we give the analytic result of our splitting functions when applied to dijet production at lepton colliders, as well as a numerical comparison for Drell-Yan process at NLO using\n[1] as well as the scheme proposed in this writeup. We additionally tested the scheme for Higgs\nproduction at hadron colliders and decay; the respective calculations will be presented elsewhere.\n4.1 Dijet production at lepton colliders\nFor dijet production at lepton colliders, the final state squared splitting function D = Dqqg is\nneeded. We denote the four-momenta of the outgoing partons in this process with p\u03021 (q), p\u03022 (q\u0304),\nand p\u03023 (g). The unintegrated dipole subtraction term for emission from p\u03021 is then given by\n\u001a\u0012 \u0013 \u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\nx1\n1 \u2212 x2\n1 \u2212 x1\n8 \u03c0 \u03b1s\nC\n\u2212\n2\n+\nD=\nF\nx2\n2 \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 (2 \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2\n1 \u2212 x2\nQ\u03022\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0012\nx1\nx1 + x2 \u2212 1\n(4.1)\n+ 2\n1 \u2212 x2\n(1 \u2212 x1 )x1 + (1 \u2212 x2 )x2\nwith xn =\n\n2 p\u0302n Q\u0302\n.\nQ\u03022\n\nThe respective integrated averaged splitting function is\n\u0013\u03b5 \u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\n1\n4\u03c0\u03bc 2\n\u03b1s\n\u03c02\n1\n3\nV =\n.\nCF\n\u2212\n1\n+\n+\n2\u03c0 \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b5 )\nQ2\n\u03b52 2\u03b5\n6\n\n(4.2)\n\nCombining the above splitting functions for both emitters with the Born, real emission, and virtual\nmatrix elements and integrating over phase space, we obtain the standard result\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03b1s\n3 \u03b1s\n23 4 2\n4 2\nNLO\nNLO {2}\nNLO {3}\n\u03c3\nCF \u221210 + \u03c0 +\n\u03c3 LO =\nCF \u03c3 LO .\n=\u03c3\n+\u03c3\n=\n\u2212 \u03c0\n2\u03c0\n3\n2\n3\n4\u03c0\n(4.3)\n5\n\n\fNagy Soper substraction scheme\n\nTania Robens\n\n\u03c3CS \u2212 \u03c3NS\n\u03c3CS\n\n0.001\n\n5\u00d710\u22124\n\n0\n\n\u22125\u00d710\u22124\n\u22120.001\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\u221a 6\nShadr [TeV]\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFigure 1: Relative difference between NLO corrections to single W production using Catani Seymour and\nNagy Soper dipoles respectively, as a function of the hardonic cm energy. The results agree on sub-permil\nlevel, shown are the numerical integration errors.\n\n4.2 Drell-Yan production\nWe calculated single W production for a pp initial state at NLO, using both the scheme in [1]\nas well as our scheme, including PDFs and varying the hadronic cm energy of the process. We\nhere only show the numerical result for this process. Figure 1 plots the relative difference between\nthe two implemented schemes. We see that the numerical differences are on the permill level and\nconsistent with zero.\n\n5. Summary and Outlook\nIn this report, we introduce a subtraction scheme which reduces the number of mappings in\nthe real emission part of an NLO calculations by a factor Njets with respect to the scheme\nsuggested in [1]. We explained the setup as well as phase space mapping, and presented first\nresults for an integrated splitting function as well as applications for simple processes. A complete\nlisting of all integrated splitting functions as well as further examples will be given in [6].\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Catani and M. H. Seymour, Nucl. Phys.
