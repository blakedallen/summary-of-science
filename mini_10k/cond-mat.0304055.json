The best-known examples of such phenomena are the stochastic resonance (SR) [1] and Brownian ratchets [2]. SR is a phenomenon in which\nthe response of a dynamical system is optimized by the presence of a specific level\nof noise and has been detected in so many seemingly different systems that it has\nbeen claimed to be \"an inherent property of rate-modulated series of events\" [3].\nHowever, it has been recently suggested that the functioning of important natural\ndevices, e.g., communication and information processing in neural systems or subthreshold signal detection in biological receptors, rely on phase synchronization\nrather than stochastic resonance [4]. The SR is usually measured by the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) for the output signal but new measures are being proposed and\ndiscussed [4,5,6].\nEmail address: gora@if.uj.edu.pl (P. F. G\u00f3ra).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n5 June 2018\n\n\fOne of the issues that is now debated and that is an origin of many unexpected\nphysical phenomena, is the role of correlations between various noises present in\nthe system. This point has been particularly stressed in research on Duffing oscillator with additive and multiplicative noises [7,8], where correlations are responsible\nfor huge changes in the activation rate, on Brownian ratchets [9], where correlations between the additive and multiplicative noises can lead to current reversal,\nand on a nonlinear rotator [10], where full correlations between two noises amount\nto nullifying one of them, leaving one of the states effectively noise-free and allowing for the passage of incoming signals of vanishing intensity. Other contexts\nin which correlations between various noise terms appear to be important include\na quantum dimer under the influence of colored noises [11], a coupled neuron network [12], synchronization of chaotic oscillators [13], detecting the gravitational\nbackground [14], and medical imaging [15]. The effect of correlations between a\nGaussian white noise and a Gaussian colored noise has been discussed in Ref. [16].\nIt is sometimes very difficult to find analytical results for nonlinear models and it\nis for that reason that models which admit rigorous solutions are very interesting.\nOne of such models is that of an overdamped linear transmitter, which in full form\nreads\n\n\u0227 = (f1 (t) + f2 (t)\u03be1 (t))a + f3 (t) + f4 (t)\u03be2 (t) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03be1,2 (t) are the noise terms. It should be mentioned that while (1) formally\nleads to a linear equation of motion with time-dependent coefficients, a multiplicative coupling between the noise and the system means a \"hidden\" nonlinearity: The\nnoise is supposed to represent many unobserved degrees of freedom coupled to\nthe transmitting process in a nonlinear manner. Although chemical reaction with\na fluctuating barrier provided the original motivation for this model, with a being\nthe concentration of a reagent, the presence of the additive noise, representing the\nthermal bath acting on the system, and an additive deterministic signal possibly\nlead to realizations that admit negative values of a(t). It, therefore, can no longer\nbe regarded as the concentration of a chemical species. Nevertheless, systems of\nthis type can still describe processes of a paramount physical interest like the electric potential across a molecular membrane [17] or provide a \"skeletal\" model of\nvarious enzymatic reactions [18]. This model, in less general forms, has also been\ndiscussed in Refs. [19]. With one exception (see below), possible implications of\nthe presence of correlations between the two noise terms in (1) have not been addressed so far. Including such correlations is an obvious extension to the existing\nresearch on models belonging to the general class (1) and is the subject of the\npresent paper.\nThere is one important exception to the general statement made in the preceding\nparagraph. Berdichevsky and Gitterman in Ref. [20] considered the linear transmitter with correlated noises and an additively coupled signal. In order to calculate the\n2\n\n\fcorrelation function of the process a(t) they obtained a whole hierarchy hai, h\u03beai,\nh\u03be 2 ai etc, where \u03be is a noise term, and needed a procedure to close the hierarchy.\nThey resorted to considering asymmetric, dichotomous, exponentially correlated\nnoises and obtained results for Gaussian white noises only as a limiting case. In\nthis paper we show how to treat the Gaussian case directly; we think this approach\nis important and interesting, even though the behavior predicted in Ref. [20] is certainly more \"rich\" than that for a pure Gaussian white noise. We also slightly differ\nwith the authors of that reference in our analysis of final results. In addition, we\nextend our previous discussion of a model with a multiplicative signal [18] to the\ncase of correlated noises. We find that correlations play an important role in this\nsystem.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the model and discuss\na couple of its formal features. We give analytical results for the expectation value,\nthe correlation function, and the power spectrum of the system with an additive\nnoise in Section 3, and analytical and numerical results for the system with a signal\ncoupled to the system multiplicatively (parametrically) in Section 4. A short discussion in Section 5 follows. Mathematical details are presented in the Appendix;\nalthough delegated to an Appendix, these details represent an important part of this\npaper.\n\n2 The model\n\nConsider a system described by the following equation:\n\n\u0227 = \u2212(ka + \u03ba\u03be1 (t) + f (t))a + \u03bb\u03be2 (t) + g(t) .\n\n(2)\n\n\u03be1 (t), \u03be2 (t) represent the multiplicative and additive noises, respectively, acting on\nthe system. f (t) and g(t) are deterministic external stimulations; in the present paper we assume that either one of them vanishes identically. The constants \u03ba and\n\u03bb allow for an independent manipulation of the noises' strengths. The model (2)\nbelongs to the general class of (1) but is simplified to keep only its most important features. The multiplicative noise represents fluctuations of a barrier and the\nadditive noise is a thermal bath acting on the system.\nThe noises acting on the system need not to be independent. On the contrary, it is\nvery likely that both the thermal bath and the process affecting the barrier height\nare correlated, as the molecular mechanisms responsible for these noises are not\nindependent. It is the objective of the present paper to examine the effect of this\ncorrelation on the dynamics of the system. To keep the model as simple as possible,\nwe assume that the noises \u03be1 (t), \u03be2 (t) form a two dimensional Gaussian process,\n3\n\n\fpoint-correlated in time:\n*\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef \u03be1 (t) \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\n\u03be2 (t)\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03be1 (t\u2032 ) \u03be2 (t\u2032 )\n\n\u0015+\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef1\n\n= \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \uf8f0\n\n\uf8f9\n\nc\uf8fa\n\nc1\n\n\uf8fb,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c \u2208 [\u22121, 1] is the correlation coefficient. We now perform the Cholesky\ndecomposition [21] of the matrix in (3) and use it to construct the noises from two\nindependent processes:\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef \u03be1 (t) \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\n\u03be2 (t)\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n0\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8fa \uf8ef \u03be(t) \uf8fa\n=\uf8f0 \u221a\n\uf8fb.\n\uf8fb\uf8f0\nc 1 \u2212 c2\n\u03b7(t)\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03be(t), \u03b7(t) are two uncorrelated Gaussian white noises (GWN): h\u03be(t)i = 0,\nh\u03b7(t)i = 0, h\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032 )i = h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i = \u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032 ), h\u03be(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i = 0, and all higher correlations factorize. A more general mechanism of describing correlations between\nthe noises has been introduced in Ref. [7], but we will show that the dynamics of\nthe system does not significantly depend on the detailed mechanism of introducing\nthe correlations.\nWe further assume that the external stimulations have a simple periodic form. The\nevolution equation (2) thus becomes\n\n\u221a\n\u0227 = \u2212(ka + \u03ba\u03be(t) + Am cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6))a + \u03bbc \u03be(t) + \u03bb 1 \u2212 c2 \u03b7(t) + Aa cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6),\n(5)\nwhere \u03c6 is an initial phase of the signal. According to what we have said above,\nonly one of the amplitudes Am , Aa does not vanish.\nThe equation (5) can be formally solved. This solution can be used to calculate its\nexpectation value and the autocorrelation function. Before we do that, we must first\nsolve a couple of problems that will appear during these calculations.\nFirst, these calculations involve certain expectation values that,\nbest knowl\u001d\n\u001c to our\nR\nT\n\nedge, have not been calculated so far: One has the form\n\u001c\n\n\u2212\n\nand the other \u03be(t1 )\u03be(t2 )e\n\nRT\nt\n\nq(t\u2032 )\u03be(t\u2032 )dt\u2032\n\n\u03be(t)e\u2212\n\nt\n\np(t\u2032 )\u03be(t\u2032 )dt\u2032\n\n\u001d\n\n, where p(*), q(*) are certain deterministic\n\nfunctions and \u03be(*) is a GWN. We show how to calculate them in the Appendix.\nSecond, the correlation functions should be averaged over the initial phase of the\nsignals, as otherwise they will not be stationary [17,22,23]. Therefore, we will use\n4\n\n\fcorrelation functions of the form\n\n1\nhha(t1 )a(t2 )ii =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\nha(t1 )a(t2 )i d\u03c6 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe braces h* * * i on the right-hand side of Eq. (6) stand for the average over realizations of the noises.\nFinally, calculating the power spectra of the processes described by Eq. (5) is our\nultimate goal. Let a(t) be a solution to the equation (5). We expect that it becomes\nstationary for t \u2192 \u221e. The simplest estimate of the power spectrum is the square\nmodulus of the Fourier transform of the process. If we were to calculate the power\nspectrum numerically, we would calculate a particular realization of a(t), reject\nseveral (perhaps many) initial values until the series becomes stationary, calculate\nthe power spectrum of the remaining series and finally average over the realization\nof the noises and the initial phase of the signal. We now follow this programme\nusing the analytical, not a numerical, solution.

For simplicity, we assume in what\nfollows that a0 \u2261 0.\nFor the expectation value of the process we obtain\n6\n\n\fe\nA cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6 + \u03c6)\n\u03bb\u03bac\nha(t)i = q\n\u2212\n1 2\n(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92 2(ka \u2212 2 \u03ba )\n\u2212(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )t\n\n+e\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\ne\n\u03bb\u03bac\nA cos(\u03c6 + \u03c6)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\nq\n\u2212\n1 2 2\n2\n2(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )\n(ka \u2212 2 \u03ba ) + \u03a9\n\n(14)\n\nwhere tan \u03c6e = \u2212\u03a9/(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 ).\n\nAs we can see, only the part of the additive noise that is correlated with the multiplicative noise contributes to the expectation value\n\u221a (14). There is a maximal admissible level of the multiplicative noise, \u03bamax = 2ka , beyond which the process\ndiverges. In the asymptotic regime, t \u2192 \u221e, the system displays stationary oscillations. The amplitude of these oscillations grows monotonically as the multiplicative\nnoise increases from zero to the maximal level. This is a manifestation of a constructive role of the noise and it is essentially the same as in the case without the\nadditive noise [17]. There is one important difference, though: Without the correlated additive noise, ha(t)i oscillates around zero, and with this noise present, it\noscillates around a value that depends on the correlation level and strengths of both\nthe multiplicative and additive noises. If we now calculate the amplitude of the\noscillations relative to this flat background,\n2(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )\nA\noscillations amplitude\n,\n=\n*q\nbackground\n\u03bb\u03ba|c|\n(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92\n\n(15)\n\nwe can see that the relative amplitude formally diverges for \u03bb\u03bac \u2192 0 (there is no\nthreshold and the system can transfer the periodic signal even in the absence of\nthe noise) and monotonically decreases to zero as the level of the multiplicative\nnoise increases towards its maximal value. In other words, if the strength of the\nmultiplicative noise is too large, the periodic stimulation gets drowned in the flat\nbackground. In this respect correlations between the multiplicative and additive\nnoises act destructively on the system.\nIf we take an average not only over realizations of the noises but also over the phase\nof the incoming signal, all oscillations vanish:\n\nhha(t)ii \u2212\u2192 a\u221e = \u2212\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03bb\u03bac\n.\n2(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )\n\n(16)\n\nWe now turn to calculating the correlations for the process a(t). The full expressions are rather long, and therefore we present the results in the asymptotic (t \u2192\n\u221e) regime only and after averaging on both the realizations of the noises and the\ninitial phase:\n7\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\nDD \u0010\n\na t\u2212\n\n1\n\u03c4\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\na t+\n\n1\n\u03c4\n2\n\n\u0011EE\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03bb\u03bac\n2(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )\n\n!2\n\n+\n\nA2 cos \u03a9\u03c4\n+\n2((ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92 )\n\uf8f6\n\n(\u03bb\u03bac)2 (ka \u2212 41 \u03ba2 ) \uf8f8 \u2212(ka \u2212 1 \u03ba2 )\u03c4\n\u03bb2\n\uf8ed\n2\n\u0011+\n\u0010\n+\ne\n2(ka \u2212\u03ba2 ) 2(ka \u2212 \u03ba2 )(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2\n4(ka \u2212\u03ba2 ) (ka \u2212 1 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92\nA2 \u03ba2\n\n2\n\n(17)\n\nWe can see that the\u221acorrelation function\n(17) exists only if the multiplicative noise\n\u221a\nlevel satisfies\n\u03ba < ka = \u03bamax / 2. For the multiplicative noise levels in the range\n\u221a\n\u03bamax / 2 \u2264 \u03ba < \u03bamax , the first moment of the process a(t) converges, but the\nsecond does not.\nThe first term in (17) corresponds to the constant shift introduced by this part of\nthe additive noise that is correlated to the multiplicative one; it is equal to a2\u221e . The\nsecond describes the oscillations in the correlation function introduced by the external periodic forcing in (5). The remaining terms describe the diffusive background:\nFirst of them is present even in the absence of the additive noise. The second contains contributions from both the correlated and uncorrelated parts of the additive\nnoise, and only the correlated part contributes to the remaining one. Note that the\nsign of this term is always positive: the presence of correlations raises the diffusive\nbackground. The correlations act destructively on the system with a additive signal.\nThe correlation function (17), leads to, via Eq. (10), to the following power spectrum:\n\nP (\u03c9) = P0 \u03b4(\u03c9) + Psignal (\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9) + \u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03a9)) + Pback (\u03c9) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\n\nP0 =\n\n\u03bb\u03bac\n2(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )\n\n!2\n\n(19a)\n\nis the power density introduced at zero frequency by the constant shift,\n\nPsignal =\n\nA2\n(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92\n\nis the power density associated with the oscillatory term, and\n8\n\n(19b)\n\n\f2 2\n\nA \u03ba (ka \u2212\n\n1 2 2\n\u03ba )\n2\n\n2\n\nh\n\n+ \u03bb 2(ka \u2212\n\nPback (\u03c9) =\n1 2 2\n\u03ba)\n2\n\nih\n\n+ c2 \u03ba2 (ka \u2212 41 \u03ba2 ) (ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92\n\n4(ka \u2212 \u03ba2 )(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )[(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92 ][(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03c9 2 ]\n\ni\n\n(19c)\n\nis the power density associated with the diffusive background. We can now calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the ratio between the power densities transferred by the signal and by the diffusive background at the frequency of the signal:\n\nPsignal\n=\nPback (\u03c9 = \u00b1\u03a9)\n(ka \u2212 \u03ba2 )(ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )[(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92 ]\nSNR(\u03ba2 , Z, c) =\n\nh\n\nih\n\n\u03ba2 (ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + Z (ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92 2(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + c2 \u03ba2 (ka \u2212 14 \u03ba2 )\n\ni\n\n, (20)\n\nwhere Z = (\u03bb/A)2 measures the relative strength of the additive noise and the signal. Regardless of the values of other parameters, SNR drops to zero for \u03ba2 = ka ,\nmeaning that the total power density comes from the noise and the signal is totally\nundistinguishable from it. For Z = 0 (20) formally diverges for \u03ba \u2192 0 (recall that\nsince there is no threshold, the system transfers the signal even for a vanishing multiplicative noise). SNR remains finite for Z > 0 and since the second term in the\ndenominator of (20) is nonnegative, SNR(\u03ba2 , Z, c) 6 SNR(\u03ba2 , 0, *). If the above\ninequality is strong, the presence of the additive noise acts destructively on the system's capabilities to transfer the signal. In any case, SNR decreases monotonically\nas the multiplicative noise increases: there is no stochastic resonance.\nFor weak signals (Z > 1) the SNR scales as Z \u22121 , which is readily seen in (20).\nFurthermore, \u2200 Z > 0, \u03ba : SNR(\u03ba2 , Z, c 6= 0) < SNR(\u03ba2 , Z, 0): If the additive\nand multiplicative noises are correlated, the system's capabilities to transfers the\nperiodic signal are slightly worse than those of the system with uncorrelated noises.\nNumerical simulations show that the system can transfer signals as weak as Z .\n100, but for such a weak signal the difference between the c = 0 and |c| = 1 cases\nis scarcely noticeable.\nFinally, we may ask what is the relative \"height\" of the \u03b4-peak in the spectrum\nassociated with the signal to the \u03b4-peak associated with what manifests itself as\na constant forcing and results from the presence of the correlations. Not surpris9\n\n\fingly,\n4(ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2\nPsignal\nA2\n,\n=\n*\nP0\n(\u03bb\u03bac)2 (ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 )2 + \u03a92\n\n(21)\n\nwhich once again shows that in the presence of the correlations between the multiplicative and additive noises, the signal is drowned by the correlated noise as the\nmultiplicative noise level increases. Note that the ratio (21) diverges if \u03bb\u03bac = 0; this\nreflects the fact that if any of the noises vanishes, or if the noises are uncorrelated,\nthere is no constant shift in the output, cf. Eq. (14) above.\n\n4 A multiplicative signal\n\nWe now consider a model described by the following equation:\n\u221a\n\u0227 = \u2212(ka + \u03ba\u03be(t) + A cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6))a + \u03bbc \u03be(t) + \u03bb 1 \u2212 c2 \u03b7(t) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere all quantities have meanings and properties of the corresponding quantities\nin Eq. (12) above. The only difference is that the signal is now coupled parametrically to the transmitter. We have discussed this model in Ref. [18], but only for the\nuncorrelated case (c = 0), where we have shown that because of the presence of\nthe additive noise, the system responds, in terms of its autocorrelation function, to\nthe signal even though the average realization of a(t) goes to zero.\n4.1 Analytical results\n\nA formal solution to Eq.

As in the previous Section, we will use this formal solution in calculating the expectation value\nof the process a(t) and its autocorrelation function.

The presence of these oscillations is clearly a\nconstructive effect of the correlations as in the uncorrelated case, c = 0, ha(t)i \u2261 0.\nIf we further average Eq.

Numerical power spectra of the process (22) for various input signal frequencies\nand correlations between the noises. The input signal frequency equals \u03a9 = \u03c0/8 (panels (i)\nthrough (iii)) and \u03a9 = 2\u03c0 (panels (iv) through (vi)). The multiplicative and additive noises\nare uncorrelated (c = 0) on panels (i), (iv), partially correlated (c = 1/2) on panels (ii), (v),\nand fully correlated\u221a(c = 1) on panels (iii), (vi). Other parameters, common for all panels,\nare ka = 1/2, \u03ba = ka /2, \u03bb = 1/4, and A = 1.\n\nand Zi are certain functions involving trigonometric functions of \u03c4 and the integration variables,\nbut not\n\u221a of t. We can see that this correlation function converges\n\u221a\nfor \u03ba < ka = \u03bamax / 2. A reasoning similar to that used in (29) shows that the\ncorrelation function becomes stationary in the limit t \u2192 \u221e. In the limit \u03a9 \u2192 0, the\ncorrelation function (31) formally diverges if A > 2(ka \u2212 \u03ba2 ). Note also that the\nsquare of the strength of the additive noise \u03bb multiplies all terms in (32). The situation is slightly paradoxical: without the additive noise, almost all realizations of the\nprocess a(t) eventually die out, yet as in the output process the power attributed to\n\"signal\" and to \"noise\" scale by \u03bb2 , the SNR does not depend on the additive noise\nlevel.\n\n4.2 Numerical results\n\nBecause of the analytical structure of Eq. (32), any further analysis of this correlation function should be performed numerically. Instead of numerically calculat13\n\n\fing the Fourier transform of Eq. (31), we have directly integrated Eq. (22) by the\nHeun method [25] with a time step h = 1/256, calculated the power spectrum\nfor each realization and averaged over 512 realizations of the noises and the initial phase. We have used Marsaglia algorithm [26] to generate the GWNs and the\nfamous Mersenne Twister [27] as the underlying uniform generator. Selected results are presented on Fig. 1. As we can see, if the external frequency is small and\nthe two noises are uncorrelated, the process a(t) does not display any oscillations,\ncf. panel (i). If the noises become correlated, distinct sharp peaks corresponding to\nthe driving frequency and its higher harmonics appear, cf. panels (ii) and (iii). For\na large driving frequency, in the uncorrelated case there is a broad peak centered\nat the driving frequency, cf. panel (iv). If the noises get correlated, a sharp line\nappears, superimposed on the broad peak, cf. panels (v) and (vi).\nIf there are no correlations, oscillations introduced by a parametrically coupled signal are, by their very nature, damped with an effective damping constant ka \u2212 21 \u03ba2 .\nIf the driving frequency is very small, with \u03a9\u22121 \u226b (ka \u2212 12 \u03ba2 )\u22121 , the transmitter is dominated by the damping term and the resulting power spectrum is nonoscillatory (Fig. 1, panel (i) above). For larger frequencies a broad peak, characteristic for damped oscillations, appears in the power spectrum (Fig. 1, panel (iv)).\nThe presence of correlations between the additive and multiplicative noises changes\nthe situation. Sharp lines, characteristic for undamped oscillations, appear in the\npower spectrum for both small and large driving frequencies. We can see that the\ncorrelations have a strong constructive effect on the transmitted signal in case of\na multiplicative coupling.\nThe presence of higher harmonics of the driving frequency on panels (ii), (iii) reflects a nonlinear nature of the multiplicative coupling between the transmitter and\nthe external signal.\n\n4.3 The origin of the constructive role of correlations\n\nTo understand, at least qualitatively, why correlations between the additive and multiplicative noises reinforce the parametrically coupled signal, observe that Eq. (22)\nis formally equivalent to\n\n!\n\nc\u03bb\n\u0227 = \u2212 (ka + \u03ba\u03be(t) + A cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6)) a \u2212\n\u03ba\n\u221a\nc\u03bb\nc\u03bb\n\u2212 ka \u2212 A cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6) + \u03bb 1 \u2212 c2 \u03b7(t) .\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n14\n\n(33)\n\n\fIf we now introduce\n\nwe obtain\n\nae = a \u2212 c\u03bb/\u03ba ,\n\na\u0117 = \u2212 (ka + \u03ba\u03be(t) + A cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6)) ae \u2212\n\n(34)\n\n\u221a\nc\u03bb\nc\u03bb\nka \u2212 A cos(\u03a9t+\u03c6)+\u03bb 1 \u2212 c2 \u03b7(t) .\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n(35)\n\nThe correlated part of the noise has been formally removed from Eq. (35). We\ncan now see that the presence of correlations effectively amounts to (i) lowering\nof the amplitude of the additive noise, (ii) introducing a constant additive forcing,\nand (iii) additively coupling to the transmitter a periodic signal with exactly the\nsame phase and frequency as the multiplicative one. The amplitude of the additional\nsignal is proportional to the product of the correlation coefficient and the strength\nof the additive noise. As we already know from Section 3, an additive periodic\nsignal introduces undamped oscillations into the correlation function which, in turn,\nintroduce very sharp lines into the power spectrum. Such lines are clearly visible\non Fig. 1.\nNote that a transformation analogous to (34), when applied to the system with\na purely additive signal (12), does not affect the signal. This observation, perhaps,\nclarifies why the presence of correlations in the additive case does not lead to any\nconstructive effects.\n\n5 Discussion\n\nIn this paper we have discussed the effects of correlations between additive and\nmultiplicative noises in a model of a linear transmitter (5). We have shown that\nthe effects of correlations is different depending on whether the signal is coupled\nadditively or multiplicatively. In the former case, the correlations act destructively:\nThe amplitude of the outgoing signal increases with the level of the multiplicative\nnoise, but the constant shift introduced by the correlations increases even faster,\nthe amplitude of the oscillations relative to the shift decreases, and the signal is\neventually drowned by the noise. Note that the correlations act here against the\nnoise: The multiplicative noise enhances the signal, but the correlations diminish\nit. Similar effects can be seen in the power spectrum and the SNR of the outgoing\nsignal. The fact that correlations reduce the destructive effects of noise has been\nreported previously; papers quoted in the Introduction provide examples of such\n15\n\n\fsystems. What we have here is an example of correlations reducing the constructive\neffect of noise.\nThese formal results, and the correlation function (17) in particular, agree with\nthose reported in Ref. [20], where the Gaussian white noise has been obtained as\na limiting case of a dichotomous, colored noise. This should come as no surprise:\nThere is a generally held belief (see e.g. [28]) that in a well defined limit the two,\nin principle very different, kinds of noise have identical effect on the dynamics of\na system. A comparison of our present results with those of Ref. [20] provides yet\nanother confirmation of this statement.\nThe situation is entirely different for the case of a multiplicative signal. We have\nshown that for a weak incoming signal not averaged over the phase, the outgoing\nsignal displays oscillations that do not vanish as the level of the multiplicative noise\nincreases. Numerical evidence suggests that without the correlations, the power\nspectrum averaged over both realizations of the noise and the initial phase does not\ndisplay any signs of oscillations for low frequencies and only damped oscillations\nfor larger frequencies. This is easy to understand: A multiplicative signal is, by its\nvery nature, damped, and if the wavelength of the signal is large, the signal does not\nrecover before if gets completely washed away by the damping. The presence of\ncorrelations changes this picture altogether: The power spectrum displays distinct,\nsharp lines for all frequencies of the input signal. We have showed analytically that\ncorrelations between the multiplicative and additive noises are effectively equivalent to adding an extra signal, with exactly the same phase and frequency as the\nmultiplicative one, to the system. The amplitude of this extra signal is proportional\nto the correlation coefficient and it is this signal that produces the sharp lines (\u03b4peaks) in the power spectrum.\nWe have assumed in Section 2 that the two noises present in the system together\nform a two-dimensional Gaussian process. On a formal level, this property is reflected in the relation between the amplitudes of the correlated and uncorrelated\nparts of the additive noise. If we relax this assumption, instead of (5) we obtain\n\n\u0227 = \u2212(ka + \u03ba\u03be(t) + Am cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6))a + \u03bb\u03be \u03be(t) + \u03bb\u03b7 \u03b7(t) + Aa cos(\u03a9t + \u03c6), (36)\nwhere no special dependence between \u03bb\u03be and \u03bb\u03b7 is assumed. The results reported in\nthis paper can now be recovered if c2 is replaced by \u03bb2\u03be /(\u03bb2\u03be + \u03bb2\u03b7 ) and Z = (\u03bb/Aa )2\nis replaced by (\u03bb2\u03be +\u03bb2\u03b7 )/A2a . Thus, results reported do not depend on the assumption\nthat the joint distribution of the noises is Gaussian. They do depend, however, on\nthe assumption that each individual noise is Gaussian and point-correlated in time.\nI acknowledge a very helpful discussion with Prof. Peter H\u00e4nggi that helped me to\nclarify certain ambiguities present in a draft version of this paper.\n16\n\n\fA\n\nAppendix: The expectation values\n\nWhile calculating the expectation value of a(t) and the correlation function of this\nprocess, one encounters several integrals that involve the expectation value of the\nexponential of an integral of the multiplicative noise \u03be(t).
