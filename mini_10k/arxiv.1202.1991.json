[11] for other works) as well as including LHC 2010 data [6\u201310] (see\nRef. [12] for other works) in the frameworks of simplified variants of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) [13] with universal supersymmetrybreaking mass parameters at the GUT scale. We consider a class of models in which R-parity\nis conserved and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), assumed to be the lightest neutralino \u03c7\u030301 [14], provides the cosmological cold dark matter [15]. The specific models studied\nhave included the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with parameters m0 , m1/2 and A0 denoting\ncommon scalar, fermionic and trilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters at the GUT\nscale, and tan \u03b2 denoting the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs\nfields. Other models studied include a model in which common supersymmetry-breaking\ncontributions to the Higgs masses are allowed to be non-universal (the NUHM1), a very\nconstrained model in which trilinear and bilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters\nare related (the VCMSSM), and minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) in which the gravitino\nmass is required to be the same as the universal soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass\nbefore renormalization (see Ref. [8] for an extensive list of references for those models)\nThe impressive increase in the accumulated LHC luminosity combined with the rapid\nanalyses of LHC data by the ATLAS [16, 17], CMS [18\u201320] and LHCb Collaborations [21]\nhave been included in the analysis presented in Ref. [8]. Most recently, the ATLAS and\nCMS Collaborations have presented preliminary updates of their results for the search for\na SM-like Higgs boson with \u223c 5/fb of data [22]. These results may be compatible with a\nSM-like Higgs boson around Mh \u2243 125 GeV, and they have been included in the analysis\npresented in Ref. [9].\nHere we review the results of Refs. [8, 9], which are focused on the CMSSM and the\nNUHM1. We discuss their impact on the physcis prospects for a future linear e+ e\u2212 collider,\nin particular the ILC, with a center-of-mass energy around 1 TeV (the ILC(1000)).\n1\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f2\n\nThe MasterCode framework\n\nWe define a global \u03c72 likelihood function, which combines all theoretical predictions with\nexperimental constraints (except the latest LHC SUSY and Higgs searches):\n\u03c72 (\u2261 \u03c72org ) =\n\nN\nX\ni\n\n2\n\nM\nobs\nfit 2\nX\n(fSM\n\u2212 fSM\n)\n(Ci \u2212 Pi )2\ni\ni\n+\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3(Ci ) + \u03c3(Pi )\n\u03c3(fSMi )\ni\n\n+ \u03c7 (Mh ) + \u03c72 (BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc)) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere N is the number of observables studied, Ci represents an experimentally measured\nvalue (constraint) and each Pi defines a prediction for the corresponding constraint that\ndepends on the supersymmetric parameters. The experimental uncertainty, \u03c3(Ci ), of each\nmeasurement is taken to be both statistically and systematically independent of the corresponding theoretical uncertainty, \u03c3(Pi ), in its prediction. We denote by \u03c72 (Mh ) and\n\u03c72 (BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )) the \u03c72 contributions from the two measurements for which only onesided bounds were previously included.\nWe stress that the three SM parameters fSM = {\u2206\u03b1had , mt , MZ } are included as fit\nparameters and allowed to vary with their current experimental resolutions \u03c3(fSM ). We do\nnot include \u03b1s as a fit parameter, which would have only a minor impact on the analysis.\nFormulating the fit in this fashion has the advantage that the \u03c72 probability, P (\u03c72 , Ndof ),\nproperly accounts for the number of degrees of freedom, Ndof , in the fit and thus represents\na quantitative and meaningful measure for the \"goodness-of-fit.\" In previous studies [1],\nP (\u03c72 , Ndof ) has been verified to have a flat distribution, thus yielding a reliable estimate\nof the confidence level for any particular point in parameter space. All confidence levels\nfor selected model parameters are performed by scanning over the desired parameters while\nminimizing the \u03c72 function with respect to all other model parameters. The function values\nwhere \u03c72 (x) is found to be equal to \u03c72min + \u2206\u03c72 determine the confidence level contour.\nFor two-dimensional parameter scans we use \u2206\u03c72 = 2.23(5.99) to determine the 68%(95%)\nconfidence level contours. Only experimental constraints are imposed when deriving confidence level contours, without any arbitrary or direct constraints placed on model parameters\nthemselves. This leads to robust and statistically meaningful estimates of the total 68% and\n95% confidence levels, which may be composed of multiple separated contours.\nThe experimental constraints used in our analyses are listed in Table 2 in [8]. It should\nbe noted that we use of the e+ e\u2212 determination of the SM contribution to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc [23],\naSUSY\n= (30.2 \u00b1 8.8) \u00d7 10\u221210 . Indeed, the (g \u2212 2)\u03bc hint has even strengthened with the\n\u03bc\nconvergence of the previously discrepant SM calculations using low-energy e+ e\u2212 and \u03c4 decay\ndata [23, 24].\nThe numerical evaluation of the frequentist likelihood function using the constraints has\nbeen performed with the MasterCode [1\u201310], which includes the following theoretical codes.\nFor the RGE running of the soft SUSY-breaking parameters, it uses SoftSUSY [25], which\nis combined consistently with the codes used for the various low-energy observables. At the\nelectroweak scale we have included various codes: FeynHiggs [26] is used for the evaluation\n(see also [27\u201330]). For flavor-related observables we use\nof the Higgs masses and aSUSY\n\u03bc\nSuFla [31] as well as SuperIso [32], and for the electroweak precision data we have included\na code based on [33]. Finally, for dark-matter-related observables, MicrOMEGAs [34] and\nSSARD [35] have been used. We made extensive use of the SUSY Les Houches Accord [36]\nin the combination of the various codes within the MasterCode.\nLCWS11\n\n2\n\n\fThe MasterCode framework is such that new observables can easily be incorporated via\nnew 'afterburners', as we discuss below for the LHC1/fb constraints. We use a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) approach to sample the parameter spaces of supersymmetric models. The sampling is based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with a multi-dimensional\nGaussian distribution as proposal density. The width of this distribution is adjusted during\nthe sampling, so as to keep the MCMC acceptance rate between 20% and 40% in order to\nensure efficient sampling. It should be noted that we do not make use of the sampling density\nto infer the underlying probability distribution. The results of Refs. [8, 9] are based on a basic resampling of the CMSSM with 7 107 points and a resampling of the NUHM1 with 7 107\nadditional points, both extending up to m0 , m1/2 = 4 TeV. We check that the afterburners\nwe apply do not shift the likelihood distributions outside the well-sampled regions.\n\n3\n\nSUSY searches at the LHC\n\nThe updates concerning SUSY searches in Ref. [8] are based on the public results of searches\nfor supersymmetric signals using \u223c 1/fb of LHC data analyzed by the ATLAS and CMS\nCollaborations and \u223c 0.3/fb of data analyzed by the LHCb Collaboration. For our purposes,\nsome of the most important constraints are provided by the ATLAS [16] and CMS [18]\nsearches for jets + E\n/ T events without leptons, as well as searches for the heavier MSSM\nHiggs bosons, H/A [17, 19]. Also important are the new upper limits on BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\nfrom the CMS [20], LHCb [21] and CDF Collaborations [37], which are incorporated in\nRef. [8].\nThe CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have both announced new exclusions in the (m0 , m1/2 )\nplane of the CMSSM based on searches for events with jets + E\n/ T unaccompanied by charged\nleptons, assuming tan \u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0 and \u03bc > 0. The updated CMS \u03b1T analysis is based\non 1.1/fb of data [18], and the updated ATLAS 0-lepton analysis is based on 1.04/fb of\ndata [16]. It is known that 0-lepton analyses are in general relatively insensitive to the\ntan \u03b2 and A0 parameters of the CMSSM, as has been confirmed specifically for the CMS\n\u03b1T analysis, and they are also insensitive to the amount of Higgs non-universality in the\nNUHM1. Therefore, we treat these analyses as constraints in the (m0 , m1/2 ) planes of the\nCMSSM and NUHM1 that are independent of the other model parameters.\nThe CMS and ATLAS 0-lepton searches are most powerful in complementary regions\nof the (m0 , m1/2 ) plane. Along each ray in this plane, we compare the expected CMS and\nATLAS sensitivities, select the search that has the stronger expected 95% CL limit, and\napply the constraint imposed by that search 1 . This subsequent evaluation/application of\nadditional/new \u03c72 contributions is called the 'afterburner'. We assign \u2206\u03c72 = 5.99, corresponding to 1.96 effective standard deviations, along the CMS and ATLAS 95% 0-lepton\nexclusion contours in the (m0 , m1/2 ) plane. In the absence of more complete experimental\ninformation, we approximate the impact of these constraints\nq by assuming that event numbers scale along rays in this plane \u221d M\u22124 where M \u2261 m20 + m21/2 , as described in [7].\nWe then use these numbers to calculate the effective numbers of standard deviations and\ncorresponding values of \u2206\u03c72 at each point in the plane. This procedure has been validated\nby comparing the likelihood it yields with results obtained independently using the generic\n1 It would also facilitate the modelling of LHC constraints on supersymmetry if the results from different\nCollaborations were combined officially, as was done at LEP, is already done for BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) searches,\nand is planned for Higgs searches.\n\n3\n\nLCWS11\n\n\fdetector simulation code DELPHES, which has also been shown to reproduce quite accurately\nthe likelihood function evaluated by the CMS Collaboration using their data [38].\n\n4\n\nSearches for a SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC\n\nWithin the supersymmetric frameworks discussed here, a confirmation of the excess reported\nby ATLAS and CMS [22] and consequently the discovery of a SM-like Higgs boson is expected\nto be possible during this year, with a mass in the range between 114 and 130 GeV [22].\nWe assume that this measurement will yield a nominal value of Mh within this range, with\nan experimental error that we estimate as \u00b11 GeV. In Ref. [9] the possibility that the LHC\nexperiments confirm the excess reported around 125 GeV and indeed discover a SM-like\nHiggs boson was analyzed. Assuming\nMh = 125 \u00b1 1(exp.) \u00b1 1.5(theo.) GeV ,\n\n(2)\n\nthis new constraint was incorporated using the 'afterburner' approach discussed above (see\nalso Ref. [8]).\n\n5\n\nResults from updated SUSY fits\n\nWe now review the effects on the global likelihood functions in various CMSSM and NUHM1\nparameter planes from the inclusion of the latest SUSY and Higgs search data. Below also\nthe implications for various physics observables are studied. The (m0 , m1/2 ) planes shown in\nFig. 1 are for the CMSSM (left) and NUHM1 (right). The regions preferred at the 68% CL\nare outlined in red, and those favoured at the 95% CL are outlined in blue. In the upper\nrow the solid (dotted) lines include (omit) the LHC1/fb data. The open green star denotes\nthe pre-LHC best-fit point [5], whereas the solid green star indicates the new best-fit point\nincorporating the LHC SUSY search results. In the lower row the solid (dotted) lines include\n(omit) the assumed LHC Higgs constraint. The open green star denotes the pre-Higgs bestfit point [8], whereas the solid green star indicates the new best-fit point incorporating a\nHiggs-boson mass measurement at 125 GeV.\nOne can see in Fig. 1 that both new experimental results have a similar, adding up effect.\nThe preferred regions are shifted by both new constraints to substantially larger m1/2 and\nsomewhat larger m0 values. A similar effect can be observed in Fig. 2, where we show the\n(m1/2 , tan \u03b2) planes in the CMSSM (left) and the NUHM1 (right), including (omitting)\nthe LHC1/fb constraints in the upper row, including (omitting) the the hypothetical LHC\nmeasurement Mh = 125 \u00b1 1 GeV in the lower row. The preferred values of tan \u03b2 are shifted\nto substantially higher values.\nThe results for the (MA , tan \u03b2) planes in the CMSSM and the NUHM1 are shown in\nFig. 3. Again both new experimental results show a similar effect. We observe a strong\nincrease in the best-fit value of MA in both models, especially in the CMSSM, where after the\ninclusion of the latest SUSY searches and the hypothetical Higgs signal now MA \u223c 1600 GeV\nis preferred. However, the likelihood function varies relatively slowly in both models, as\ncompared to the pre-LHC fits.\nLCWS11\n\n4\n\n\fm1/2 [GeV/c2]\n\nm1/2 [GeV/c2]\n\n2500\npre LHC\n\n2000\n\nLHC1/fb\n\npre LHC\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n500\n\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n0\n0\n\n2500\n\nm0 [GeV/c2]\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nm0[GeV]\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n500\n\n500\n\n2500\n\n1500\n\n0\n0\n\nLHC1/fb\n\nm0 [GeV/c2]\n\nm1/2[GeV]\n\nm1/2[GeV]\n\n2500\n\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nm0[GeV]\n\nFigure 1: The (m0 , m1/2 ) planes in the CMSSM (left) and the NUHM1 (right). The \u2206\u03c72 =\n2.30 and 5.99 contours, commonly interpreted as the boundaries of the 68 and 95% CL\nregions, are indicated in red and blue, respectively. In the upper row the best-fit point after\nincorporation of the LHC1/fb constraints is indicated by a filled green star, and the pre-LHC\nfit [5] by an open star. The solid lines include the LHC1/fb data and the dotted lines showing\nthe pre-LHC fits. In the lower row the solid lines include the hypothetical LHC measurement\nMh = 125\u00b11 GeV and allowing for a theoretical error \u00b11.5 GeV, and the dotted lines repeat\nthe contours including the LHC1/fb , but without this Mh constraint. Here the open green\nstars denote the pre-Higgs best-fit points [8], whereas the solid green stars indicate the new\nbest-fit points.\n\n6\n\nImplications for the ILC(1000)\n\nIn view of the interest in building an e+ e\u2212 collider as the next major project at the energy frontier, we briefly review the post-LHC1/fb predictions for expectations for sparticle\nproduction in e+ e\u2212 annihilation within the CMSSM and NUHM1. In this respect it has to\nbe kept in mind that the LHC searches are mainly sensitive to the production of coloured\nparticles, whereas lepton colliders will have a high sensitivity in particular for the production of colour-neutral states, such as sleptons, charginos and neutralinos, as well as yielding\nhigh-precision measurements that will provide indirect sensitivity to quantum effects of new\nstates.\n5\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f2000\n\nLHC1/fb\n\n2500\npre LHC\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n500\n\n0\n0\n\nm1/2[GeV]\n\nm1/2 [GeV/c2]\n\npre LHC\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n60\n\ntan(\u03b2)\n\n2500\n\nm1/2[GeV]\n\nm1/2 [GeV/c2]\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n500\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ntan \u03b2\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ntan(\u03b2)\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2500\n\n1500\n\n0\n0\n\nLHC1/fb\n\n0\n0\n\n60\n\ntan \u03b2\n\nFigure 2: The (m1/2 , tan \u03b2) planes in the CMSSM (left) and the NUHM1 (right), including\n(omitting) the LHC1/fb constraints in the upper row, including (omitting) the the hypothetical\nLHC measurement Mh = 125 \u00b1 1 GeV in the lower row. The notations and significations\nof the contours are the same as in Fig. 1.\nFig. 4 compares the likelihood functions for various thresholds in the CMSSM (upper\npanel) and the NUHM1 (lower panel), based on the global fits made using the LHC1/fb and\nXENON100 constraints. The lowest thresholds are those for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 , \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03031 , \u1ebdR \u1ebdR and\n\u03bc\u0303R \u03bc\u0303R (the latter is not shown, it is similar to that for \u1ebdR \u1ebdR ). We see that, within the CMSSM\nand NUHM1, it now seems that these thresholds may well lie above 500 GeV, though in\nthe CMSSM significant fractions of their likelihood functions still lie below 500 GeV. The\nthresholds for \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 and \u1ebdR \u1ebdL + \u1ebdL \u1ebdR are expected to be somewhat higher, possibly a bit\n\u2213\nbelow 1 TeV. The preferred value for the threshold for \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03c7\u03031 lies at about 1700 GeV in both\nthe CMSSM and NUHM1 scenarios, that for the HA threshold lies above 1 TeV, and that\nfor first- and second-generation squark-antisquark pair production lies beyond 2.5 TeV in\nboth models.\nWhat are the implications for the ILC(1000)?\nTwo aspects are important for the correct interpretation of the results reviewed above with\nrespect to the ILC(1000). First, anything inferred from the coloured sector concerning\nthe uncoloured sector depends on the underlying model assumptions, and in particular on\nassumptions about the possible universality of soft supersymmetry breaking at the GUT\nLCWS11\n\n6\n\n\ftan(\u03b2)\n\ntan(\u03b2)\n\n60\n\n50\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\npre LHC\n\n40\n\npre LHC\n\nLHC1/fb\n\nLHC1/fb\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n0\n0\n\n1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n2\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nMA [GeV/c ]\n\ntan \u03b2\n\ntan \u03b2\n\n60\n\n60\n\n50\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\nMA[GeV]\n\n1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n2\n\nMA [GeV/c ]\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\nMA[GeV]\n\nFigure 3: The (MA , tan \u03b2) planes in the CMSSM (left) and the NUHM1 (right), including\n(omitting) the LHC1/fb constraints in the upper row, including (omitting) the the hypothetical\nLHC measurement Mh = 125 \u00b1 1 GeV in the lower row. The notations and significations\nof the contours are the same as in Fig. 1.\n\nscale. Non-universal models, e.g., low-energy supersymmetric models, or models with different GUT assumptions, could present very different possibilities.\nSecond, while within the CMSSM and the NUHM1 the preferred SUSY and heavy Higgs\nmass ranges move to substantially higher values, this upward shift goes along with a substantial increase in \u03c72 /d.o.f., as can be seen in Tab. 1. Here we review the results for the\nbest-fit points in the CMSSM and in the NUHM1 \"pre-LHC\" (i.e. no SUSY searches at the\nLHC, nor any assumption about about any possible Higgs mass measurement), \"pre-Higgs,\npost-LHC\" (i.e. including the LHC1/fb SUSY searches, but no assumption about any possible Higgs measurement) and \"Mh \u2243 125 GeV\" (in addition the assumption of Eq. (2)).\nThe droop in the \"Fit probability\" is clearly visible. The reason is that the pre-LHC data\nfavors relatively low SUSY mass scales (to a large extent driven by (g \u2212 2)\u03bc , supported by\nMW and other observables), while the non-observation of colored SUSY particles favores\na heavier spectrum, leading to an increasing tension within the CMSSM and the NUHM1.\nConcerning the production thresholds shown in Fig. 4, further increases in the excluded\nregions would yield even higher thresholds, but would also make the CMSSM or NUHM1\nseem even less likely. The time might come to take another look at other GUT based or\nnon-minimal supersymmetric models, in which the colored sector (mainly searched for at\n7\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f\u2206\u03c72\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n9\n8\n7\n\n9\n8\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n0 0 5\n\u223c\n\u03c7\u223c\n\u03c7\n\n~q\n~)\nMin(q\n\n5\n\n0 0 4\n\u223c\n\u03c7\u223c\n\u03c7\n1 2 3\n+ \u223c\n\u03c7\u223c\n\u03c7\n\n~e\n~\ne\nL R\n\n4\n\n~e\n~\ne\nL L\n\n3\n\n~ e\n~\ne\nR R\n\n2\n\nHA 1\n\n\u223c\n\u03c41\u223c\n\u03c41\n\n1 1\n\n1 1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\nCMSSM\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nQ [GeV/c2]\n\n0\nCMSSM\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n9\n8\n7\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nQ [GeV/c2]\n\n9\n8\n\n6\n\n0 0 5\n\u223c\n\u03c7\u223c\n\u03c7\n\n4\n\n\u03c7\u03c7\n1 2 3\n+ \u223c\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\u223c\n1 1\n\n500\n\n7\n\n6\n1 1\n\u223c0\u223c0\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n\nHA 1\n0\n\n0\nNUHM1\n\n~q\n~)\nMin(q\n\n5\n\n~e\n~\ne\nL R\n\n4\n\n~e\n~\ne\nL L\n\n3\n\n~ e\n~\ne\nR R\n\n2\n\n\u223c\n\u03c41\u223c\n\u03c41\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nQ [GeV/c2]\n\n1\n0\n\n0\nNUHM1\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nQ [GeV/c2]\n+ \u2212\n\nFigure 4: The \u03c72 likelihood functions for various pair-production thresholds in e e , as\nestimated in the CMSSM (upper panel) and the NUHM1 (lower panel) after incorporating\nthe XENON100 [39] and LHC1/fb constraints.
