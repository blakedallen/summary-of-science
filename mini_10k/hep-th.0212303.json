In the bosonic sector it\ncombines the worldline dilaton with the fields parametrizing the R-symmetry coset\nS 2 \u223c SU (2)/U (1).

The extended supersymmetry requires\nthis potential to be accompanied by a d=1 WZW term on S 2 . We study the classical\ndynamics of the bosonic action and the geometry of its sigma-model part. It turns\nout that the relevant target space is a cone over S 2 for any non-zero \u03b1 6= \u00b1 21 . The\nconstructed model is expected to be related to the 'relativistic' N =4 mechanics of\nthe AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 superparticle via a nonlinear transformation of the fields and the\ntime variable.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nModels of conformal and superconformal quantum mechanics [1]-[14] are important basically due to their role as 'conformal field theories' in the AdS2 /CFT1 version of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence [15], the fact that they describe the near-horizon dynamics of\nthe black-hole solutions of supergravity, and their tight relation with integrable CalogeroMoser type systems.\nThe recent renewal of interest in (super)conformal mechanics models was mainly triggered by the observation [6] that the radial motion of a superparticle at zero angular\nmomentum in the near-horizon region of the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole is\ngoverned by a modified ('new' or 'relativistic') version of conformal mechanics. The corresponding background is AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 , with the radial coordinate of the superparticle\nparametrizing its AdS2 part. Since the full isometry of this background is the supergroup\nSU(1, 1|2), it was suggested in [6] that the full (radial and angular) dynamics of this superparticle is described by a 'new' variant of N=4 superconformal mechanics 1 containing\nthree physical bosonic fields in its supermultiplet (the radial AdS2 coordinate and two angular coordinates parametrizing S 2 ). Yet, even the 'old' conformal mechanics [1] has not\nbeen extended in full generality to an N=4 superconformal mechanics (with additional\nangular fields). The N=4 superconformal mechanics constructed in [5] contains only one\nbosonic physical field in its off-shell supermultiplet (namely the dilaton associated with\nthe generator of spontaneously broken dilatations). In this sense the model represents a\nminimal N=4 extension of the standard one-component conformal mechanics of ref.[1].\nAn attempt to define the most general superconformal mechanics on SU(1, 1|2) using\nthe nonlinear realization approach was undertaken in [7]. However, neither an invariant\naction nor the solution of the irreducibility constraints on the Goldstone superfields were\npresented.\nA Green-Schwarz-type action for the AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 superparticle was constructed in [17].\nAfter properly gauge-fixing kappa-symmetry and worldline diffeomorphisms the corresponding action can be treated as an N=4 superconformal mechanics action extending\nthat of the 'new' conformal mechanics. However, the N=4 superconformal symmetry in\nsuch an action is non-manifest and closes only on shell, which is typical for the gauge-fixed\nGreen-Schwarz-type actions.\nThere are two basic ways of constructing superconformally invariant actions in one dimension. One of them proceeds from the most general N=1 supersymmetric sigma model\non the d=1 worldline of the particle (in general supplemented by a coupling to an external\nelectromagnetic potential). Then one looks for the restrictions the extra superconformal\ninvariance imposes on the geometry of such a sigma model (see e.g. [12]-[14]). In this\napproach one as a rule deals with component fields (or at most N=1 superfields), and\nthe extra Poincar\u00e9 and conformal supersymmetries are not manifest. The other approach,\npioneered in [5] and later employed in [7], starts from nonlinear realizations of appropriate\nsuperconformal symmetries in terms of a set of worldline Goldstone superfields. It is a\nnatural generalization of the approach of ref. [4] where conformal mechanics [1] was shown\nto have a natural description in terms of a nonlinear realization of SO(1, 2), the conformal\ngroup in one dimension. In this way the aforementioned minimal N=4 superconformal\n1\n\nBy N we always count real d=1 Poincar\u00e9 supercharges. This convention differs from the nomenclature\ndue to ref. [16] in which N denotes the number of complex d=1 Poincar\u00e9 supercharges.\n\n1\n\n\fmechanics, associated with the supergroup SU(1, 1|2) and having only a dilaton field in\nthe bosonic sector, was found and studied [5]. Besides keeping manifest and off-shell the\ncomplete set of d=1 Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetries, this second approach has the advantage\nthat it automatically generates the correct irreducibility conditions for the basic Goldstone superfields and ensures a geometric interpretation for their components (the bosonic\nand fermionic d=1 Goldstone fields) as parameters of the relevant supercosets.\nIn the present paper, following the nonlinear realization approach of [5], we construct\nthe most general N=4 superfield extension of the 'old' conformal mechanics with additional angular fields in the bosonic sector. We start with the exceptional supergroup\nD(2, 1; \u03b1) [18] as the most general N=4 superconformal group in one dimension. After\nthe appropriate choice of the supercoset, the only Goldstone N=4 superfields surviving\nthe inverse Higgs procedure [20] are the superdilaton and the two parameters of the coset\nSU(2)/U(1) (a second SU(2) \u2282 D(2, 1; \u03b1) is placed into the stability subgroup and acts\non the fermions only). For these three superfields there naturally appear simple irreducibility conditions. Surprisingly, the latter prove to be identical to those used in [21]\nfor constructing the off-shell N=4 supersymmetric 1d sigma model action with a bosonic\ntarget manifold of dimension 3k. It is easy to solve these constraints through an unconstrained prepotential and to construct two independent superfield invariants which in\ncomponents give rise to the kinetic term and a scalar potential term. The latter is necessarily accompanied by a worldline WZW term on S 2 which is nothing but the coupling\nof the charged particle to a Dirac magnetic monopole (see e.g. [22]). Besides the N = 4\nsuperfield form of the invariant action we present its N = 2 superfield form. As was\nrecently shown [23], the 'old' and 'new' conformal mechanics models are actually related\nby a nonlinear transformation of the time variable and the coordinate fields (it is a particular case of the 'holographic' transformation introduced in [24]). We expect that this\nequivalence extends to the case we are dealing with. Namely, at least for the special case\nof D(2, 1; \u03b1=\u22121) \u223c SU(1, 1|2) \u2282\u00d7 SU(2) we surmise the existence of a nonlinear transformation which maps the N=4 superconformal mechanics we shall presently construct\nto the 'new' N=4 superconformal mechanics of the AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 superparticle. On shell its\naction should coincide with the gauge-fixed action of ref. [17].2\n\n2\n\nD(2,1;\u03b1) supergroup as N=4 superconformal group\nin d=1 and its nonlinear realization\n\nWe use the standard definition of the superalgebra D(2, 1; \u03b1) [18] with the notations of\nref.

(2.30), (2.32).\nThe action (3.6) vanishes for \u03b1 = \u22121, i.e. for the SU(1, 1|2) case, as a consequence of\n(2.24). Hence, in this situation we consider instead\nZ\nZ\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n\u0001\u2212 3\n4\n2 \u22122\n2\n1\nln V = dtd2 \u03b8 v 2 + 4\u03c1\u03c1\u0304 2 DvDv + D\u03c1D \u03c1\u0304 .

The\ninvariance of (3.8) immediately follows from the results of [5] where a similar action was\nconsidered for the basic superfield having the same transformation properties as (V 2 )\u22121/2\nand being subject to constraints more general than (2.24). The field content of [5] was\ndifferent however.\n1\nLet us note that 1+\u03b1\nS1 is regular for any \u03b1 and coincides with S\u03b1=\u22121 for \u03b1 = \u22121.\nIn manifestly N = 4 covariant notation the action (3.8) is recovered from (3.6) in the\nfollowing way. The latter is invariant for any nonzero \u03b1. Let us expand its Lagrangian\ndensity around \u03b1 = \u22121:\nV2\n\n1\n\u0001 2\u03b1\n\n= V2\n\n\u0001\u2212 21 \u2212 \u03b1+1\n+O((\u03b1+1)2 )\n2\n\n= V2\n\n\u0001\u2212 12\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\u2212 1\n\u03b1+1\nV 2 2 ln V 2 + O (\u03b1+1)2 .\n2\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe first term does not contribute to the action in virtue of (2.24), and so we have\n1\n\u0001\u2212 1\n\u0001\u2212 1 i\n1 h 2 \u0001 2\u03b1\nV\n\u2212 V 2 2 = \u2212 12 V 2 2 ln V 2 + O(\u03b1+1) ,\n\u03b1+1\n\nwhich yields just (3.8) in the limit \u03b1 = \u22121.\n\n8\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fThe potential term is easier to present in the N = 2 superfield formulation:\n!\np\nZ\n2\nv + v + 4\u03c1\u03c1\u0304\nSp = dtd2 \u03b8 ln\n.\n2\n\n(3.11)\n\nTo construct this term, one starts from the obvious ansatz\nSp(0) = ln v = u + const\n\n(3.12)\n\nto which Sp should simplify upon reduction to the N = 2 superconformal mechanics based\non the supergroup SU(1, 1|1) [5]. The variation of (3.12) with respect to (3.3) reads\n\u03b4Sp(0) = \u2212\n\n\u03b4 (\u03c1\u03c1\u0304)\n.\nv2\n\n(3.13)\n\nThus to have an N = 4 supersymmetric potential term we have to add a term which\ncompensates for (3.13), namely\n\u03c1\u03c1\u0304\n(3.14)\nSp(1) = 2 .\nv\nIterating this recursive procedure, we eventually uncover the final form (3.11) of the N = 4\ninvariant potential term via\n\u03c1\u03c1\u0304 3 \u0010 \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 \u00112 10 \u0010 \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 \u00113 35 \u0010 \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 \u00114\n+\n\u2212\n+ ...\n\u2212\nv2\n2 v2\n3 v2\n4 v2\n!\np\n\u221e\n\u0010 \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 \u0011n+1\n2 + 4\u03c1\u03c1\u0304\nX\nv\n+\n(2n\n+\n1)!\nv\n.

Hence, it is D(2, 1; \u03b1) invariant.\nIt is interesting to rewrite the potential term in a manifestly N = 4 supersymmetric\nform, i.e. in N = 4 superspace in terms of the superfield V ik . It turns Rout to be a\nsuperconformally invariant version of the standard Fayet-Iliopoulos term \u223c dtd4 \u03b8W:\n\u0012Z\n\u221a Z\n4\nSp = \u2212i 2 dtd \u03b8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\ndy \u2202y W \u221a\nV2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.16)\n\nThe scale invariance of Sp is easily seen. Indeed, the integration measure has the dilatation weight (\u22121) (in units of length), while V ik , V 2 and W have weights \u03b1, 2\u03b1 and \u03b1+1,\nrespectively. Then, the weight of the Lagrangian density in (3.16) is just +1, and (3.16)\nis scale invariant. It is also easy to show its invariance under the whole N = 4 superconformal symmetry. One should take into account the transformation law of the superspace\nintegration measure (2.30) and the transformation laws (2.32) and (2.35). The invariance\nof Sp under the gauge transformations (2.27) of the prepotential W immediately follows\nfrom the constraints (2.24). The extra parameter y in (3.16) defines a deformation W(y)\nwith W(1) = W and W(0) = const. Hence, the expression (3.16) is analogous to the\nstandard representation of WZW terms on group manifolds via an integral over an extra\n9\n\n\fparameter [28]. In particular, we observe that in the variation \u03b4Sp this integral can be\ntaken off (one should use (2.25) while checking this):\n\u221a Z\n1\n\u03b4Sp = \u2212i 2 dtd4 \u03b8 \u03b4W \u221a\n.\n(3.17)\nV2\n\u221a\nTherefore, this term makes a tensor contribution \u223c 1/ V 2 to the full N = 4 superfield\nequations of motion as obtained by varying the total action with respect to the prepotential W. This WZW structure is not accidental: in the bosonic sector the superpotential\n(3.16) contains the d = 1 WZW term on the sphere S 2 = SU(2)/U(1).\nRe-expressing the superpotential (3.16) in the N = 2 superfield form (3.15) is rather\ninvolved though straightforward. One should make use of the relation\n1\n1\n1\nW = \u2212 \u03b8i \u03b8\u0304k V ik + D i (\u03b82 \u03b8\u0304k Vik ) \u2212 D i (\u03b82 \u03b8\u0304k Vik ) ,\n6\n12\n12\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhich is valid modulo gauge transformations from (2.27).

It describes the dynamics of a particle with coordinates u(t), \u039b(t), \u039b(t) in a three-dimensional\ntarget space. In (4.1), the first term is the kinetic term of the dilaton u, the second one\nis the action of the SU(2)/U(1) \u223c S 2 nonlinear sigma model, the third one is the standard dilaton potential, and the fourth one is a WZW term on S 2 . The dilaton potential\narises after eliminating the auxiliary field from the sum of (3.6) and (3.21), while the\nWZW term comes solely from (3.21). The strict relation between the dilaton potential\nand WZW term is required by N = 4 supersymmetry.\nAn equivalent form of the action is achieved by expressing it through standard spherical\ncoordinates r, \u03b8, \u03c6 via\n\u03b8\n1\n\u039b = tan ei\u03c6 , eu/2 = \u221a \u03bcr ,\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u03bd2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nSB =\ndt 4\u03b1 \u03bc \u1e59 + \u03bcr \u03b8\u0307 + sin \u03b8 \u03c6\u0307 \u2212\n+ 2\u03bd cos \u03b8 \u03c6\u0307 .\n2\n\u03bc r2\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nIt is also instructive to rewrite (4.1) in such a way that the potential term has the form\ntypical for 3-dimensional conformal mechanics. One denotes Y = (v, \u03c1, \u03c1\u0304) and defines the\n1\u22122\u03b1\nnew Cartesian coordinates as X i = \u03bc\u22121 Y i |Y| 2\u03b1 . With this, (4.1) is rewritten as\n\"\n#\nZ\n3ik i k\n2\n1\n\u01eb\nX\n\u1e8a\n\u03bd\nSB = dt \u03bc gik (X)\u1e8a i \u1e8a k \u2212\n,\n(4.4)\n+ 2i\u03bd 3\n4\u03bc |X|2\n(X + |X|)|X|\nwhere\ngik (X) = \u03b4ik + (4\u03b12 \u2212 1)\n\nXi Xk\n.\n|X|2\n\n(4.5)\n\nFrom this representation it is clearly seen that only at \u03b1 = \u00b11/2 the kinetic and potential\nterms of X coincide with those of the standard 3-dimensional conformal mechanics. At\nany other nonzero value of \u03b1 one gets a conformally invariant nonlinear sigma model\nwhich is a particular case of the general 1d sigma model with 3k-dimensional target space\nfirstly considered in [21]. The advantage of the form (4.4) is that SU(2) is manifest in all\nterms except for the WZW one.\nTo see which kind of geometry the sigma model in (4.1), (4.4) reveals, let us look at\nthe line element corresponding to (4.3) (with \u03bc = 1 for simplicity),\n\u221a\nds2 = 4\u03b12 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 , r = 2 eu/2 = |X| ,\n(4.6)\nwhere\nd\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62\n\n(4.7)\n\nis the invariant Killing form on the sphere S 2 . This metric belongs to a 3-dimensional cone\nC(B) over the base manifold B = S 2 of radius 4\u03b11 2 (see [29] for the relevant definitions).\nAt \u03b1 = \u00b11/2 one recovers flat space R3 (a cone over S 2 of unit radius), while at any other\n\u03b1 one ends up with a curved manifold. It is easy to evaluate the corresponding Ricci\ntensor and scalar curvature as\n\u0011\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\n\u0010 1\n\u0011 2\n\u0010 1\n2\n\u22121\n,\nR\n=\n\u22121\nsin\n\u03b8\n,\nR\n=\n\u22121\n,\n(4.8)\nR\u03b8\u03b8 =\n\u03c6\u03c6\n4\u03b12\n4\u03b12\n4\u03b12\nr2\n11\n\n\fand all other components being zero. Thus for \u03b1 6= \u00b11/2 our manifold is neither Ricciflat nor of constant scalar curvature. Note that such a conical geometry is typical for the\nbosonic sectors of superconformal theories in diverse dimensions [29]. The metric in (4.6),\nin agreement with the general finding of [21], is conformally flat, which can be shown by\n1\nchanging the radial variable as r = r\u0302 2|\u03b1| .\nFinally, let us discuss some properties of the S 2 WZW term in (4.1). It is not manifestly\nSU(2) invariant: under the SU(2)/U(1) transformations of \u039b, \u039b\u0304,\n\u03b4\u039b = b + b\u0304 \u039b2 ,\n\n\u03b4 \u039b\u0304 = b\u0304 + b \u039b\u03042 ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nit is shifted by a full time derivative\n\u03b4\n\n\u039b\u0304\u039b\u0307 \u2212 \u039b\u039b\u0304 \u0307\n= b\u0304 \u039b\u0307 \u2212 b \u039b\u0304 \u0307 ,\n1 + \u039b\u039b\u0304\n\n(4.10)\n\ni.e. it is invariant up to an abelian gauge transformation as should be. As was observed\nfor the first time in [30], the WZW term is conformally invariant on its own. Also typical\nfor WZW terms [31, 28], the constant \u03bd needs to be quantized,\n\u03bd \u2208 21 Z\n\n(4.11)\n\n(see [22] and refs. therein). Thus the coefficient in front of the superpotential in our\nN = 4 superconformal mechanics should be quantized for topological reasons. As a consequence, the dilaton mass (the coefficient of the dilaton potential in (4.3)) is proportional\nto the square of an integer.6 This should be contrasted with the N = 4 superconformal\nmechanics of ref. [5] where no WZW term is present in the bosonic sector and, therefore,\nno restriction on the strength of the potential term arises.\nTo further clarify the meaning of the WZW term, let us introduce a constant unit\n3-vector C i , |C| = 1, and rewrite the WZW term in (4.4) (with the factor 2i\u03bd detached)\nas\n\u01ebikl C k X l\n\u1e8a i \u2261 A * \u1e8a .\n(4.12)\nLW ZW =\n[(X * C) + |X|] |X|\n\nChoosing the frame C 3 = 1, C 1 = C 2 = 0, one reproduces just the WZW term in (4.4).\nNow one observes that this term is nothing but the coupling of a non-relativistic particle\nX i (t) to the potential Ai of a Dirac magnetic monopole, with the singular Dirac string\noriented along X = \u2212C. It is easy to calculate the corresponding magnetic field strength\nF\n\nkl\n\nk\n\nl\n\nl\n\nk\n\nklp\n\n= \u2202 A \u2212\u2202 A =\u01eb\n\nXp\n|X|3\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhich is indeed independent of C i . It is also easy to check that the dependence of the\nWZW term on the unit vector C i is reduced to a full time derivative (it is a worldline\npull-back of a gauge transformation of Ai ) and, hence, the action does not depend on this\nparameter up to topological effects. This follows from the relation\n\u0014 p\n\u0015\nX + C p |X|\npij\ni j\n\u01eb C \u2202C (LW ZW ) = \u2212\u2202t\n.\n(4.14)\n(X * C) + |X|\nThus eq. (4.11) is just the Dirac quantization condition.\n6\n\nSome other arguments why this parameter of the bosonic conformal mechanics should be quantized\nwere adduced in [8].\n\n12\n\n\f5\n\nSpecial bosonic dynamics\n\nIn this Section we put \u03bc = 1 for simplicity. In standard spherical coordinates r = (xi ) =\n(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) our bosonic Lagrangian\n\u0001\n1\n\u03bd2\n4\u03b12 \u1e59 2 + r 2 \u03b8\u03072 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 2 + \u03bd cos \u03b8 \u03c6\u0307\n2\n2r\n\u0001\n1\n4\u03b12 \u1e59 2 + L2 r \u22122 \u2212 A0 (r) + Ai (r) \u1e8bi\n=\n2\n\nLB =\n\n(5.1)\n\ndescribes an electrically charged particle in a spherically symmetric external electromagnetic field given by\nxi\nxi\nEi = \u03bd 2 4\nand\nBi = \u2212\u03bd 3 .\n(5.2)\nr\nr\nNote that A0 =\u03bd 2 /2r 2 is just a central scalar potential while (Ar =0, A\u03b8 =0, A\u03c6 =\u03bd cos \u03b8)\nyields a Dirac monopole of magnetic charge g=\u2212\u03bd. The two potentials are related by\nN=4 supersymmetry; this will give rise to special dynamics.\nLet us analyze the particle motion in more detail. The angular dynamics is independent of \u03b1. Obviously conserved is the canonical momentum\np\u03c6 = r 2 sin2 \u03b8 \u03c6\u0307 + \u03bd cos \u03b8 =: j\n\n(5.3)\n\nbecause \u03c6 is a cyclic variable. The \u03b8 equation of motion\n(j\u2212\u03bd cos \u03b8)(j cos \u03b8\u2212\u03bd)\nr 2 sin3 \u03b8\n\n\u2202t (r 2 \u03b8\u0307) =\n\n(5.4)\n\nstill permits the solution \u03b8\u0307 = 0 while \u03c6\u0307 6= 0 provided that\nj cos \u03b8 = \u03bd\n\n,\n\ni.e.\n\ncos \u03b8 = const ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhich places the motion on a (two-dimensional) cone with opening angle \u03b8 around the\n3-axis. This choice of coordinates simplifies\n\u03c6\u0307 =\n\nj\nr2\n\nand\n\nl2 := L2 = j 2 sin2 \u03b8 = j 2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 = const.\n\n(5.6)\n\nThe radial motion is governed by\nj2\n4\u03b1 r\u0308 = 3\nr\n2\n\n=\u21d2\n\n1 2 2\nj2\nE := 4\u03b1 \u1e59 + 2 = const ,\n2\n2r\n\nwhich is readily solved by\nr(\u03c6) =\n\nr0\n\u03c6\ncos 2\u03b1\n\n(5.7)\n\n(5.8)\n\n\u221a\nwhere r0 = j/ 2E is the minimal distance to the origin. The trajectories are unbounded;\nthe polar scattering angle is \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03b1\u03c0. As usual, the motion is fixed by two data: l (or\nj or \u03b8) and E.\nWithout the central potential A0 (r) the particles would follow geodesics on the 2D\ncone inside the 3D cone; the magnetic field merely exerts the constraining force. The\n13\n\n\frepulsive force provided by A0 (r), however, is of a special kind because it gives rise to an\nenhanced ('dynamical') symmetry, at least in the flat case \u03b12 =1/4: Rotational invariance\nimplies (\u00e0 la Noether) the conservation of a canonical angular momentum vector J which,\ndue to the magnetic potential, differs from the kinematical angular momentum L = r \u00d7 \u1e59\nvia\nr\nJ = L+\u03bd\n=\u21d2\nJ2 = l 2 + \u03bd 2 = j 2 .\n(5.9)\nr\nFrom rr *J = \u03bd we infer again that the motion is constrained to a cone around J, and L is\nprecessing with angular velocity j/r 2 . The equation of motion\nr\u0308 = \u03bd 2\n\n\u1e59\u00d7r\nJ\nr\n\u2212\u03bd 3 = \u03bd 3\n4\nr\nr\nr\n\n(5.10)\n\nconfirms, of course, that J\u0307 = r \u00d7 (equation of motion) = 0 irrespective of the central\npotential. For A0 =0 this system has been analyzed, e.g. in [22] where also hidden symmetries in the absence of an electric potential were discussed. The special form of A0 ,\nhowever, keeps the acceleration r\u0308 in a fixed direction (\u223c J) which implies\nr\u0308 \u00d7 J = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u1e59 \u00d7 J =: I = const.\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u1e59 * I = 0\n\n(5.11)\n\nmeaning that the trajectory is planar (\u22a5 I). This result was already apparent in (5.8)\nfor 2\u03b1=1. Hence, the particle follows a special hyperbola. Yet another way to seeing this\nemploys the effective potential\nVeff =\n\nl2\n\u03bd2\nj2\n+\n=\n2r 2 2r 2\n2r 2\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhich, together with r 2 \u03c6\u0307 = j, shows that the projection onto the \u03b8= \u03c02 plane (\u22a5 J) gives\njust free motion, i.e. a straight line, with l replaced by j.\nTo characterize the symmetry enhancement present for our particular central potential A0 (in combination with the magnetic potential Ai ), we compute the Poisson brackets\nof J=(Jk ) and I=(Ik ) in flat space (for \u03b12 = 1/4) 7 and find\n{Jk , Jl } = \u01ebklm Jm\n\n,\n\n{Jk , Il } = \u01ebklm Im\n\n,\n\n{Ik , Il } = \u22122H\u01ebklm Jm\n\n(5.13)\n\n2\n\nwhere H = 12 (p2 + \u03bdr2 ) denotes the Hamiltonian of our system. It is part of the symmetry\nalgebra and conserved with value H = E. The relation I2 = 2HL2 may be exploited to\ndirectly find the trajectory via\n\u221a\n2E l r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 = |I|r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 = r*I = r*(\u1e59\u00d7J) = L*J = L2 = l2 (5.14)\nsin \u03b8\nwhich yields r(\u03c6) = \u221al/\nonce more. The algebra (5.13) is very reminiscent of the one\n2E cos \u03c6\ngenerated in the Kepler problem by the angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz vector,\nin the E>0 case of unbounded motion. Indeed, rescaling Ik reveals an SO(3, 1) symmetry\nalgebra, just like in the latter case.\n\n7\n\nThe magnetic field modifies the canonical brackets: {pk , pl } = \u01ebklm Bm for the momenta pk =\u1e8bk .\n\n14\n\n\f6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn this paper we have presented a new variant of N=4 superconformal mechanics based on\na nonlinear realization of the most general d=1, N=4 superconformal symmetry associated\nwith the supergroup D(2, 1; \u03b1). In the bosonic sector our version contains on the worldline,\nbesides the dilaton field, two fields parametrizing the two-sphere S 2 \u223c SU(2)/U(1). This\nfield content suggests that the model can be mapped, by a generalization of the equivalence\ntransformation of [24, 23], onto N=4 AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 superconformal mechanics describing a\ncharged AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 superparticle, and so may be a 'disguised' form of the latter (perhaps,\nfor a special value of \u03b1).\nThe nonlinear realization superfield techniques allowed us to construct the relevant\naction in a manifestly N=4 supersymmetric way in terms of off-shell N=4 superfields\nsubject to the constraints proposed in [21]. We also gave an N=2 superfield form of the\naction. There exist two separate invariants which, respectively, extend the kinetic term of\nthe dilaton combined with an SU(2)/U(1) nonlinear sigma model as well as the potential\nterm of dilaton. For the latter case, N=4 supersymmetry requires the dilaton potential to\nbe accompanied by a d=1 WZW term on S 2 . The former may be viewed as the potential\nof a radial electric field, and the latter is interpreted as the coupling to a Dirac magnetic\nmonopole. The coupling constant in front of the WZW term is topologically quantized.\nIt simultaneously defines the dilaton mass, and so the latter is also quantized in the N=4\nsuperconformal mechanics under consideration. The target space of the full bosonic sigma\nmodel for arbitrary nonzero values of the parameter \u03b1 turned out to be a cone over S 2 . The\nrelevance of such conical geometries to superconformal theories was pointed out in [29].\nFurthermore, we have studied the classical dynamics of the bosonic sector of the model.\nIts three worldline fields are the coordinates of a nonrelativistic massive charged particle\nmoving in the conical 3D manifold equipped with a certain electromagnetic background.\nThe particle motion is characterized by an interesting interplay between the electric and\nmagnetic forces which restrict the trajectory to the intersection of a 2D cone and a plane.\nIn fact, the special form of the potentials gives rise to a dynamical SO(3, 1) symmetry\ninvolving the Hamiltonian, just like for unbounded motion in the Kepler problem.\nIt is worth remarking on the relation to previous studies. In components and in N=1\nsuperfields, the N=4 superconformal mechanics associated with D(2, 1; \u03b1) was already\ndiscussed in [12] as a special class of 1d supersymmetric sigma models [32]. However, no\ndetailed form of D(2, 1; \u03b1) invariant actions was presented. The D(2, 1; \u03b1) superconformal\nmechanics models (actually, the \u03b1=0 and \u03b1=\u22121 special cases) made their appearance also\nas tools for describing the near-horizon geometry of four-dimensional multi black holes in\n[13, 14]. Yet, no explicit examples of a superconformal N=4 superfield action and/or an\nN=4 superpotential were given there.\nBesides the problems of establishing the explicit relationship with the AdS2 \u00d7S 2 superparticle and of considering the quantization of the presented system (constructing the relevant Hamiltonian etc.), there are other directions in which the results of this paper could\nbe extended. First of all, it is interesting to elaborate on alternative nonlinear realizations\nof D(2, 1; \u03b1) which could give rise to as yet unknown versions of N=4 superconformal mechanics. For instance, we might place all the generators of one SU(2) in the coset, leaving\nthe second SU(2) in the stability subgroup, or else break both SU(2) groups by considering the coset SU(2) \u00d7SU(2)/SU(2)diag or the coset SU(2)/U(1) \u2297SU(2)/U(1) \u223c S 2 \u2297S 2 .\nThe corresponding versions of N=4 superconformal mechanics, if existing, should contain\n15\n\n\fthree (in the first two cases) or four (in the third case) physical bosonic fields besides the\ndilaton in their bosonic sectors. It would be interesting to examine whether there exist\nsuitably constrained N=4, d=1 superfields capable of accommodating these field contents.\nWe expect that the precise form of the constraints is predicted by the nonlinear realization\nformalism, like in the case considered in this paper. In the four-field cases, d=1 versions\nof the hypermultiplet are likely to be recovered in this way.\nAnother intriguing problem is the construction of N=8 superconformal mechanics. It\nwas recently noticed [33] (see also [34, 35]) that one can realize off-shell N=8, d=1 Poincar\u00e9\nsupersymmetry on a N=4 chiral superfield and the N=4 superfield V ik subject to the\nconstraints (2.19). This representation is a d=1 reduction of the vector N=2, d=4 multiplet, just like the N=4 multiplet described by V ik is a reduction of the N=1, d=4 vector\nmultiplet [21]. The corresponding manifold of physical bosons is 5-dimensional. This\nmatches nicely with the bosonic content of the hypothetical N=8 conformal mechanics\nbased on a nonlinear realization of one of possible N=8, d=1 superconformal groups, viz.\nOSp(4\u2217|4) having SU(2) \u00d7 SO(5) as R-symmetry [19] and containing the N=4, d=1 superconformal group SU(1, 1|2) as a supersubgroup [18]. The relevant supercoset should\ninclude the dilaton and the four coordinates of the 4-sphere S 4 \u223c SO(5)/SO(4) as the\nbasic Goldstone superfields.\n\nAcknowledgements\nO.L. would like to thank N.
