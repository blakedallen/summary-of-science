The approach, which allows a formal\ninversion of Einstein's equations, explains, for example, why spherically symmetric perfect fluids\nwith spatially homogeneous energy density must be shearfree.\n\nAny spacetime is an \"exact solution\" Einstein's equations, but only those which are \"physically reasonable\" are\nworthy of consideration. Whereas the term \"exact solution\" has no precise definition, the concept is well understood\n[1] [2]. The concept of \"physically reasonable\" is somewhat more slippery and it is the responsibility of the author of\nany new exact solution to justify its significance. Clearly the force fitting of a metric to a sufficiently general energymomentum tensor is but nonsense. However, proceeding from a general energy-momentum tensor to more restricted\ncases can provide insight into properties of the idealizations. Here we consider spherically symmetric spacetimes which\nadmit a fluid source subject to a zero flux condition equivalent to the requirement of zero thermal conductivity. First,\nwe proceed in an invariant purely geometrical fashion. Then, by way of Einstein's equations, we translate our results\ninto physical (albeit phenomenological) parameters.\nConsider a spherically symmetric spacetime M [3]\nds2M = ds2\u03a3 + R2 d\u03a92\n\n(1)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 is the metric of a unit sphere (d\u03b82 +sin2 (\u03b8)d\u03c62 ) and R = R(x1 , x2 ) where the coordinates on the Lorentzian\ntwo space \u03a3 are labelled as x1 and x2 . (No specific choice of coordinates on \u03a3 will be made.) Consider a flow (a\ncongruence of unit timelike vectors u\u03b1 ) tangent to an open region of \u03a3. Writing n\u03b1 as the normal to u\u03b1 in the tangent\nspace of \u03a3 we restrict M by the condition that there exists u\u03b1 such that\nG\u03b2\u03b1 u\u03b1 n\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere G\u03b2\u03b1 is the Einstein tensor of M. (The Vaidya metric [4] (corresponding to a null flux) provides a familiar\nexample of an M for which such a flow does not exist.) Now u\u03b1 (and n\u03b1 ) are, if they exist, uniquely determined\nfrom the metric alone. (Equations u\u03b1 u\u03b1 = \u22121, n\u03b1 n\u03b1 = 1, u\u03b1 n\u03b1 = 0 and the zero flux condition (2) are solved for\nthe components of u\u03b1 and n\u03b1 and the appropriate roots determined by the time orientation of M (say u1 > 0).) The\nalgorithm for producing u\u03b1 for specific coordinates on \u03a3 is straightforward and discussed elsewhere in a more general\ncontext [5]. In what follows we make use of the following scalars:\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nG \u2261 G\u03b1\n,\n\u03b1 , G1 \u2261 G\u03b1 u u\u03b2 , G2 \u2261 G\u03b1 n n\u03b2 , \u2206 \u2261 \u03c3\u03b1 n n\u03b2 , \u03a8 \u2261 G + G1 \u2212 3G2, W \u2261 C\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 C\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 is the shear associated with u\u03b1 and C\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is the Weyl tensor. A necessary and sufficient condition for the\nconformal flatness of M is W = 0.\nPerhaps the most important function associated with M is the effective gravitational mass M (x1 , x2 ) the invariant\nproperties of which were first explored by Hernandez and Misner [6] who wrote the function in the form\nM=\n\nR3\nR \u03b8\u03c6 ,\n2 \u03b8\u03c6\n\n(4)\n\nwhere R is the Riemann tensor of M. See also [7], [8], [9] and [10] for further discussion and [11] for a recent\napplication. In terms of the scalars (3) M can be given as\nM=\n\n\u221a\nR3\n(G + 3(G1 \u2212 G2) + 3W)\n12\n\n(5)\n\nfrom which we immediately obtain the following necessary and sufficient condition for the conformal flatness of M:\nM=\n\nR3\n(G + 3(G1 \u2212 G2)).\n12\n\n(6)\n\n\f2\nFrom (2) and (5) it follows that\n\u2032\n\nM =\n\nG1 2 \u2032\nR R\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere is the intrinsic derivative in the direction n\u03b1 . (For the case of a perfect fluid in comoving coordinates (7) is\nwell known (e.g. [2] section 1.4).) Assuming that M is non-singular (the scalars (3) remain finite) and has an origin\n(R = 0) it follows from (5) and (7) that\n\u221a\n\u2032\nG1 = 0 \u21d4 G + G1 \u2212 3G2 + 3W = 0\n(8)\nor, equivalently,\n\u2032\n\nG1 = 0 \u21d4 M =\n\nG1R3\n.\n6\n\n(9)\n\nObserve that if\n\u03a8=0\n\n(10)\n\nG1 = 0 \u21d4 W = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nthen\n\u2032\n\nTo transform the forgoing invariant geometrical statements into physical phenomenological parameters by way of\nEinstein's equations, decompose the energy-momentum tensor in the form\nT\u03b2\u03b1 = \u03c1u\u03b1 u\u03b2 + p1 n\u03b1 n\u03b2 + p2 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 + p2 (u\u03b1 u\u03b2 \u2212 n\u03b1 n\u03b2 ) \u2212 2\u03b7\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1 .\n\n(12)\n\nEinstein's equations are effectively reversed by way of the following observation: Substitution of\nG1\n,\n8\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\nG2\n+ 2\u03b7\u2206,\n8\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nG + G1 \u2212 G2\n\u2212 \u03b7\u2206,\n16\u03c0\n\n(15)\n\n\u03c1=\n\np1 =\nand\np2 =\n\ninto (12) and multiplication by 8\u03c0 produces G\u03b2\u03b1 . Note in particular that there are at most three independent Ricci\nscalars in this case and that the syzygy (17) of [12] for the decomposition (12) must, by way of the foregoing inversion,\nreduce to an identity as can be directly verified [5]. The following specializations arise, where in all cases the energy\ndensity is given by (13):\na. \u03b7\u2206 = 0: If \u03b7\u2206 = 0 (one or more of \u03b7, \u2206 or \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = 0) then \u03a8 = 0 is a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nperfect fluid (p1 = p2 , \u03b7 = 0).\nb.\n\np1 \u2261 p2 \u2261 p, \u2206 6= 0:\n\nIf p1 \u2261 p2 \u2261 p, \u2206 6= 0 it follows from (14) and (15) that\nG + G1\n,\n24\u03c0\n\n(16)\n\nG + G1 \u2212 3G2\n,\n48\u03c0\u2206\n\n(17)\n\np=\nand\n\u03b7=\n\nso that \u03a8 = 0 is once again a necessary and sufficient condition for a perfect fluid.\n\n\f3\nc. p1 6= p2 , \u2206 6= 0:\nNow p1 is given by (14) and p2 by (15) where \u03b7 is a freely specified function. The special\nchoice \u03b7 \u2261 0 reduces to case a.\nClearly any spacetime M satisfying (2) is an \"exact solution\" of Einstein's equations: simply put (13), (14) and\n(15) into (12). Only with the imposition of a constraint, like \u03a8 = 0, is M restricted. For example, in the static\ncase, where \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = 0, any M is a \"solution\", but with the constraint \u03a8 = 0 relatively few available solutions make any\nphysical sense [13] [14]. As emphasized previously, only those \"exact solutions\" which make physical sense are worthy\nof consideration. The possibility that a given M might have more than one physically reasonable interpretation is\nnot excluded, but all possible interpretations subject to (12) are delineated above. Because the foregoing procedure\nis algorithmic, and because alternate interpretations of know solutions are of some interest if physically justified, the\nprocedure is being incorporated into the interactive database GRDB [15].\nIn terms of the parameters (\u03c1, p1 , p2 , \u03b7) we have\nM=\n\n\u221a\nR3\n(16\u03c0(\u03c1 + p2 \u2212 p1 + 3\u03b7\u2206) + 3W),\n12\n\n(18)\n\n4\u03c0 3\nR (\u03c1 + p2 \u2212 p1 + 3\u03b7\u2206),\n3\n\n(19)\n\n4\u03c0 3\nR \u03c1,\n3\n\n(20)\n\nW =0\u21d4M =\n\u2032\n\nG1 = 0 \u21d4 M =\nand if\n\np2 \u2212 p1 + 3\u03b7\u2206 = 0\n\n(21)\n\nthen\n\u2032\n\nG1 = 0 \u21d4 W = 0.\n\n(22)\n\nCondition (22) generalizes a previously known condition [16]. A perfect fluid is a special case of (21) and in that case\nwe have\n\u2032\n\nG1 = 0 \u21d4 W = 0 \u21d2 \u03c3\u03b2\u03b1 = 0\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the last implication comes from the fact that all conformally flat perfect fluids are shear free [17]. The condition\n\u2032\nG1 = 0 \u21d2 \u03c3\u03b2\u03b1 = 0, for a perfect fluid in the comoving frame, is stated in [1] (section (14.2.4)) and attributed to\n[18] and [19]. Neither [1] (in that section), [18] nor [19] even mention the Weyl tensor, the vanishing of which, as the\nforegoing makes clear, can be considered central to the result.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\nPortions of this work were made possible by use of GRTensorII [20].
