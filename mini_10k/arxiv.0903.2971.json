Even though\nthe recent years have seen considerable progress in loop quantum gravity, string theory,\nand asymptotic safety, to mention just three approaches [1], it seems that certain essential\ningredients of a satisfactory microscopic theory are still missing or only poorly understood.\nIn any of these approaches one typically encounters problems which are conceptually very\ndifficult and deep, and at the same time highly complex from the calculational point of\nview. On the conceptual side, the most severe problem is perhaps the issue of background\nindependence [2\u20134]. Already classically General Relativity is distinguished from all other\nphysical theories in that it does not only tell us how physical processes take place in a\ngiven spacetime but also describes the dynamics of spacetime itself. Many problems one\nencounters when searching for a quantum theory of gravity can be traced back to this\ncrucial property of General Relativity, namely that it dynamically generates the \"arena\"\nin which all physics is going to take place. In particular, the mediator of the gravitational\ninteraction, the metric or closely related fields, defines the proper length or mass scale of\nall dimensionful physical quantities.\n(A) Asymptotic Safety In the following we investigate a particular aspect of background (in)dependence which is particularly important in the context of asymptotic\nsafety [5\u201328]. In this approach gravity is described by a quantum field theory of the\nmetric tensor which is renormalized at a non-Gaussian renormalization group (RG) fixed\npoint. This quantum field theory is defined by a functional RG trajectory on a \"'theory space\" consisting of well-behaved diffeomorphism invariant action functionals. This\ntrajectory must be complete in the sense that it has neither an infrared nor an ultraviolet cutoff. In the ultraviolet the absence of unphysical divergences is guaranteed by the\nrequirement that the trajectory must hit a fixed point there.\n(B) Coarse graining in gravity In order to implement this idea one has to pick a\nconcrete RG framework. In principle many choices are possible here; they differ by the\ngenerating functionals they employ, in the way field configurations get \"integrated out\"\n\n1\n\n\falong the RG flow, and, related to that, the interpretation of the corresponding RG scale,\nhenceforth denoted k. In theories on flat spacetime there exist implementations of the\nWilsonian RG, the effective average action [29\u201332] for instance, which have the special\nproperty that the mass scale k has a \"quasi\u2013physical\" meaning in the following sense: The\nbasic functional RG equation (FRGE) describes the k-dependence of a family of effective\nactions {\u0393k , 0 \u2264 k < \u221e} each of which defines an effective field theory valid near the\n\nscale k.\n\nGoing over to quantum gravity it is not clear a priori how one could introduce an RG\nscale with a comparable physical meaning. The problem is that if k is to have the status\nof a physical momentum it must be a proper rather than merely a coordinate momentum.\nHowever, proper momenta, distances, or other dimensionful quantities require a metric\nfor their definition, and if the metric is dynamical it is not clear with respect to which\nmetric k should be \"proper\". Proceeding naively, the average action of gravity would be\na functional \u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd ] which, besides k, depends on a single argument g\u03bc\u03bd . More precisely,\n\u0393k [ * ], for every fixed value of k, is a map from the space of metrics into the reals. This\n\nimplies that from the point of view of \u0393k [ * ] with k fixed all metrics have an equal status\n\nso that k cannot be \"proper\" with respect to any particular one of them. This is a direct\n\nconsequence of background independence. It entails that the naive implementation of\nthe average action idea, leading to a family of functionals {\u0393k } which depend only on\n\none metric argument, cannot be labeled by an RG scale with the above \"quasi\u2013physical\"\ninterpretation.\n\n(C) The gravitational average action The actual effective average action for gravity\nconstructed in [6] achieves the desired \"quasi\u2013physical\" status of k by using the background field technique. The idea is to fix an arbitrary background metric g \u03bc\u03bd , quantize\nthe (not necessarily small) metric fluctuations h\u03bc\u03bd nonperturbatively in this background,\nand finally adjust g \u03bc\u03bd in such a way that the expectation value of the fluctuation vanishes:\nh\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 hh\u03bc\u03bd i = 0. In this way the background gets fixed dynamically. The advantage of\n\nthis procedure is that the quantization can take advantage of many nonperturbative tools\ndeveloped for field theories on non-dynamical backgrounds. More imortantly it is background independent in the sense that no special g \u03bc\u03bd plays any distinguished role. During\n\n2\n\n\fthe quantization of the h\u03bc\u03bd -field the background metric is kept fixed but is never specified\nexplicitly.\nIn this construction the RG scale k is \"proper\" with respect to the background\nmetric. Technically one organizes the path integral over h\u03bc\u03bd according to eigenmodes of\nthe covariant Laplacian D 2 (g \u03bc\u03bd ) built from g \u03bc\u03bd and cuts off the integration at the infrared\n(IR) scale k 2 . This is done by adding a mode suppression term \u2206k S to the bare action.\nHence k is a g \u03bc\u03bd -proper momentum related to the scale set by the \"last mode integrated\nout\" and can be given an approximate physical meaning therefore. (See [22, 23] for a\ndetailed discussion of this point.) This property of the gravitational average action is the\ncentral prerequisite for the effective field theory interpretation and for the possibility of\nperforming \"RG improvements\" on the basis of \u0393k [33\u201344].\nThe price one has to pay for this advantage is that the average action is now a functional of two metrics: \u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd , g \u03bc\u03bd ] \u2261 \u0393k [ h\u03bc\u03bd ; g \u03bc\u03bd ]. Here g\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 g \u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd is the expectation\n\nvalue of the microscopic metric. Only after having solved for the (now more complicated) RG flow of \u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd , g \u03bc\u03bd ] one can impose h\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and define the reduced functional\n\u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd ] \u2261 \u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd , g\u03bc\u03bd ] which generates the same on-shell matrix elements as the original\n\none [45].\n\n(D) \"Background independence\" via background field technique It should be\nstressed that the average action \u0393k [ * , * ] and its RG flow are \"background independent\"\n\nobjects, in the sense of the word as it is used in loop quantum gravity [2\u20134], for instance.\n\nBoth metrics, g\u03bc\u03bd and g \u03bc\u03bd , are just freely variable arguments and no metric plays any\ndistinguished role1 . Furthermore, the mode cutoff is defined in terms of D 2 ( g\u03bc\u03bd ) which\ninvolves the variable metric g \u03bc\u03bd and not any rigid one. This is in sharp contrast to\nnon-dyn\nmatter field theories on a non-dynamical spacetime with a metric g\u03bc\u03bd\n. There \u2206k S is\nnon-dyn\nconstructed from D 2 (g\u03bc\u03bd\n) which does indeed single out a specific metric. The resulting\n\nflow is not \"background independent\" in the above sense.\nBesides fixing the physical scale of k, the use of the background field technique has\n1\n\nHere and in the following the term \"background independence\", put in quotation marks, means the\n\nabsence of a preferred metric. Referring to the background field formalism, no quotation marks will be\nused.\n\n3\n\n\fa second, conceptually completely independent advantage: If one employs a gauge fixing\nterm which is invariant under the background gauge transformations the resulting average\naction is a diffeomorphism invariant functional of its arguments [45].\nIn the construction of the gravitational average action in [6] these two issues are\nintertwined and because of the complexity of realistic RG flows it is not easy to see how\nprecisely the g \u03bc\u03bd -dependence of the IR cutoff \u2206k S[h\u03bc\u03bd ; g \u03bc\u03bd ] influences the flow. We shall\ndescribe this influence in a setting as \"clean\" as possible, namely in an approximation to\nthe full gravitational RG flow where gauge issues play no role and the impact of this gdependence of the cutoff can be studied in isolation. The implications of the g-dependence\nare at the very heart of quantum gravity. It arises only because the metric has the crucial\nproperty, not shared by any other field, of defining the proper size of all dimensionful\nquantities, including that of k.\nWithin a different theory of gravity, and in a different formal setting, Floreanini and\nPercacci [46] have made similar observations. They studied a perturbatively renormalizable gauge theory of vielbein and spin connection fields. While asymptotic safety is not an\nissue there, they demonstrated that the quantization of the model results in a \"bimetric\ntheory\", and depending on which metric is used in the ultraviolet (UV) regulator different\neffective potentials are obtained for the conformal factor.\n(E) The conformally reduced theory The system we are going to study in the following obtains by approximating the gravitational RG flow in two ways: First, we restrict the\ntheory space to that of the familiar Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation whose RG flow is known\nin full generality [6, 9]. Second, we quantize only the conformal factor of the metric but\nnot the other degrees of freedom it carries. This \"conformally reduced Einstein\u2013Hilbert\"\n(or \"CREH\") truncation leads to a modified RG flow on the same theory space as the full\nEinstein\u2013Hilbert truncation, and it will be very instructive to compare the two.\nAll metrics appearing in the CREH framework, the integration variable in the path\ng\u03bc\u03bd \" where\nintegral, \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd , as well as g \u03bc\u03bd and g\u03bc\u03bd , are of the type \"conformal factor times b\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd is a reference metric which is never changed; for example, b\nb\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd . In this way,\n\n\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd , g \u03bc\u03bd , and g\u03bc\u03bd get represented by a single \"scalar\" function, their respective conformal\ng\u03bc\u03bd . If one inserts\nfactor. The background metric, for instance, is written as g \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72B (x) b\n4\n\n\fthe metric \u03c62 b\ng\u03bc\u03bd into the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action one obtains a \u03c64 -type action for the\nfield \u03c6, with a \u03c64 -coupling proportional to the cosmological constant. We shall analyze\nthis scalar\u2013looking theory by means of an effective average action. We use a background\n\napproach which is analogous to the one used in the full gravitational FRGE. In particular\nthe conformal factor of g \u03bc\u03bd sets the physical scale of k. So, conceptually, this simplified\nsetting is exactly the same as in the full gravitational flow equation, the only difference is\nthat we allow only the quantum fluctuations of the conformal factor to contribute to the\nRG running of the couplings, i. e. the Newton and the cosmological constant, respectively.\n(F) Conformal factor vs. \u03c64 -theory The standard quantization of \u03c64 -theory by means\nof an FRGE for the average action is fairly well understood [31]. It amounts to using a\ng \u03bc\u03bd -independent cutoff. Here \u2206k S is built from b\ng\u03bc\u03bd which is usually taken to be the metric\n\nof flat Euclidean space. It is this metric b\ng\u03bc\u03bd which defines the meaning of k. This scheme\n\nis the natural one when \u03c6 is a conventional scalar matter field. By now a lot is known\nabout the resulting RG flow [31]. In particular, above all mass thresholds one recovers\nthe ln(k)-running of the \u03c64 -coupling which is familiar from perturbation theory.\n\nIf \u03c6 is the conformal factor of the metric the situation is different. Now it is natural\ng\u03bc\u03bd ;\nto define \u2206k S and hence k in terms of the adjustable background metric g \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72B (x) b\n\nits conformal factor \u03c7B is determined dynamically by the condition that the fluctuations\n\nabout \u03c7B have vanishing expectation value. We shall see that the resulting RG flow is\nquite different from the standard scalar one. Typically one finds that the RG running is\nmuch faster in the gravitational case.\nFor instance, there is a regime where the slow ln(k)-running of the standard scalar is\nreplaced by a much stronger k 4 -running of the \u03c64 -coupling. In this regime the \u03c64 -coupling\nis proportional to the cosmological constant, \u039bk . Hence, in this particular regime, \u039bk \u221d k 4 .\n\nThis quartic cutoff dependence is something very well known, of course. It is precisely\n\nwhat one finds by summing zero-point energies, or rediscovers as quartic divergences in\nordinary Feynman diagram calculations. Moreover it agrees with the result from the full\nEinstein\u2013Hilbert truncation.\nTo summarize this important point: The (expected) behavior \u039bk \u221d k 4 obtains only\n\nif we respect \"background independence\" and appreciate the very special role of gravity,\n\n5\n\n\fnamely that it determines all proper scales, including that of k. We find \u039bk \u221d k 4 only if\nwe define the cutoff with g \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72B (x) b\ng\u03bc\u03bd , while we obtain the much weaker k-dependence\n\u039bk \u221d ln(k) if we treat \u03c6 as an ordinary scalar.\n\nEarlier on Polyakov [47] and Jackiw et al. [48] have pointed out that in the CREH\n\napproximation the gravitational action is of the \u03c64 -type and argued on the basis of standard scalar field theory that the cosmological constant should have a logarithmic scale\ndependence therefore. Our results indicate that if one wants to attach a physical meaning\nto k by measuring it in units of \u03c6 itself the running of \u039bk is much faster in fact.\n(G) Asymptotic safety in a \u03c64 -type theory Perhaps the most unexpected and striking feature of the CREH flow is that it admits a non-Gaussian RG fixed point (NGFP)\nwith exactly the same qualitative properties as the one in the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation. The comparatively simple dynamics of a \u03c64 -theory is enough to achieve asymptotic\nsafety provided one quantizes the theory in a \"background independent\" way.\nAt the NGFP the cosmological constant is positive and this translates to a negative\n\u03c64 -coupling. Long ago Symanzik [49,50] showed that the scalar \u03c64 -theory with a negative\ncoupling constant is asymptotically free; its coupling strength vanishes logarithmically at\nhigh momenta. Using the cutoff appropriate for the gravitational field the asymptotically\nfree RG flow becomes an asymptotically safe one, a NGFP develops.\nThe investigations using the gravitational average action which have been performed\nduring the past few years [6\u201319] indicate that full Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is\nindeed likely to possess a NGFP which makes the theory asymptotically safe. Increasingly\ncomplicated truncations of theory space were analyzed whereby all modes of the metric\nwere retained. The results which we shall describe in the following indicate that the NGFP\nthat was found in these analyses is perhaps easier to understand than it was thought up\nto now. It seems that, to some extent, it owes its existence to an essentially \"kinematical\"\nphenomenon which is related to the requirement of \"background independence\" and the\nfact that the dynamical field itself, the metric, determines the proper value of the coarse\ngraining scale. The complicated selfinteractions of the helicity-2 modes, on the other\nhand, can be omitted without destroying the NGFP. While also characteristic of gravity,\nthey seem not to be essential for asymptotic safety.\n\n6\n\n\fThe remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. As a preparation we\ndiscuss in Section 2 the conformally reduced Einstein\u2013Hilbert action. Then, in Section\n3, we derive an exact flow equation for conformally reduced gravity. In Section 4 we\nspecialize it for the CREH truncation and explain in particular the conceptual differences\nof the theory presented here and standard scalar matter field theories. In Section 5 we\nanalyze the RG equations obtained from the CREH truncation and show that they predict\na NGFP. The conclusions are contained in Section 6.\nFor further details we refer the reader to [24] and [25].\n\n2\n\nThe Conformally Reduced Einstein\u2013Hilbert Action\nIn d spacetime dimensions, the Euclidean Einstein\u2013Hilbert action reads\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\ndd x g R(g) \u2212 2 \u039b .\nSEH [g\u03bc\u03bd ] = \u2212\n16\u03c0 G\n\n(2.1)\n\nHenceforth we shall assume that the argument g\u03bc\u03bd is a conformal factor times a fixed,\nnon-dynamical reference metric b\ng\u03bc\u03bd . We would like to parameterize this conformal factor\nin terms of a \"scalar\" function \u03c6(x) in such a way that the kinetic term for \u03c6 becomes standard, \u221d (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 . This is indeed possible for any dimensionality. Introducing \u03c6 according\n\nto [48],\n\nwith the exponent\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c62\u03bd(d) b\ng\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03bd(d) \u2261\n\n2\nd\u22122\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nstandard formulas for Weyl rescalings yield the following result for SEH evaluated on\nmetrics of the form (2.2):\nZ\n\u0011\np \u0010\n1\nb \u03c62 \u2212 \u03be(d) \u039b \u03c62d/(d\u22122) . (2.4)\ndd x b\nSEH [\u03c6] = \u2212\ng 12 gb \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + 12 \u03be(d) R\n8\u03c0 \u03be(d) G\nb is the curvature scalar of the reference metric b\nHere R\ng\u03bc\u03bd , and\n\u03be(d) \u2261\n\nd\u22122\n.\n4 (d \u2212 1)\n\n7\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fIn 4 dimensions we have \u03bd = 1 and \u03be = 1/6 so that the choice\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c62 b\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\nconverts the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action to a kind of \"\u03c64 -theory\":\nZ\n\u0011\np \u0010\n3\n1 b 2\nSEH [\u03c6] = \u2212\nR \u03c6 \u2212 16 \u039b \u03c64 .\ng 12 gb \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + 12\nd4 x b\n4\u03c0 G\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe shall refer to the action (2.4) and its special case (2.7) as the conformally reduced\nEinstein\u2013Hilbert or \"CREH\" action.\nUp to now b\ng\u03bc\u03bd is an arbitrary metric, defined on the same smooth manifold as g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nLater on we shall fix the topology of this manifold to be that of flat space Rd or of the\nsphere Sd .\n\nFor d > 2, the case we shall always assume in the following, the kinetic term in\nSEH [\u03c6] of eq. (2.4) is always negative definite due to the \"wrong sign\" of its prefactor.\nAs a result, the action is unbounded below: for a \u03c6(x) which varies sufficiently rapidly\nSEH [\u03c6] can become arbitrarily negative. This is the notorious conformal factor instability.\nLeaving aside issues related to the functional measure, quantizing gravity in the\nCREH approximation based upon the bare action SEH [\u03c6] is similar to quantizing a scalar\ntheory with an action of the general type\nZ\no\nn\nS[\u03c6] = c d4 x \u2212 21 (\u2202\u03c6)2 + U(\u03c6)\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere c is a positive constant. For the sake of the argument let us assume that b\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\n\nis the flat metric on R4 . Then SEH of (2.7) is indeed of the form (2.8) with the potential\nU(\u03c6) =\n\n1\n6\n\n\u039b \u03c64 and c = 3/(4\u03c0G) > 0. Let us assume that the cosmological constant is\n\npositive, the case which will be relevant later on. For \u039b > 0 the potential term in the\naction (2.8) is positive definite, while the kinetic piece is negative definite. We would like\nto explore the quantum theory based upon the functional integral\nZ\ne\nI \u2261 D\u03c6 eiS[\u03c6]\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere Se is the Wick rotated version of S, with (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2261 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6. One would expect\n\nthat in this theory the wrong sign of the kinetic term drives the condensation of spatially\n\n8\n\n\finhomogeneous (x-dependent) modes, i. e. the formation of a \"kinetic condensate\" similar\nto the one discussed in [51]. The amplitude of the inhomogeneous modes cannot grow\nunboundedly since this would cost potential energy.\nNext let us look at the closely related theory with the \"inverted\" action Sinv [\u03c6] \u2261\n\n\u2212S[\u03c6]. Thus\n\nSinv [\u03c6] = c\nwith the negative potential\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\nn\n\n+ 21 (\u2202\u03c6)2 + V (\u03c6)\n\no\n\nV (\u03c6) \u2261 \u2212U(\u03c6) \u2264 0.\n\n(2.10)\n\n(2.11)\n\nIn pulling out a global minus sign from S the instability inherent in the theory has been\nshifted from the kinetic to the potential term. According to Sinv , the kinetic energy\nassumes its minimum for homogeneous configurations \u03c6 = const, but the inverted potential V (\u03c6) = \u2212 16 \u039b \u03c64 becomes arbitrarily negative for large \u03c6.\n\nEven though S and Sinv appear to be plagued by instabilities of a very different\n\nnature, they nevertheless describe the same physics (up to a time reflection). The path\nintegrals involving S and Sinv are related by a simple complex conjugation:\nZ\ne\nIinv \u2261 D\u03c6 e\u2212iS[\u03c6] = I \u2217 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe shall refer to the formulation in terms of S and Sinv as the original picture and the\ninverted picture, respectively.\nSo we see that for pure gravity in the CREH approximation the \"wrong\" sign of the\nkinetic term can be traded for an upside down potential. The FRGE formalism we are\ngoing to develop will effectively correspond to the inverted picture. As we shall see it is\nindeed the \u039b > 0 case that will be relevant to asymptotic safety. Hence the conformal\nfactor dynamics is described by an action with positive kinetic but negative potential\nterm.\nInterestingly enough, this kind of \u03c64 -theory with a negative coupling constant was\ndiscussed by Symanzik [49] long ago. He showed that the coupling strength vanishes at\nshort distances, thus providing the first example of an asymptotically free quantum field\ntheory [50].\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nEffective Average Action for the Conformal Factor\n\n3.1\n\nThe Background Field Method\nThe most important difference between the conformal factor and an ordinary scalar\n\nis that \u03c6 determines the magnitude of all physical scales; in particular it determines the\nproper scale that is to be ascribed to a given numerical value of the IR cutoff k appearing\nin the FRGE context. For this reason the quantization of \u03c6 by means of an FRGE differs\nfrom the standard one. In fact, even though gauge issues do not play any role here,\nthe background field method has to be employed. This approach will allow us to give a\nmeaning to statements like \"\u0393k describes the dynamics of fields averaged over spacetime\nvolumes of extension \u223c k \u22121 \" in presence of a quantized metric where a priori it is unclear\nin which metric the extension of those spacetime volumes is measured.\n\nBefore we can set up the RG formalism we must explain the background\u2013reformulation\nof the path integral underlying the quantum field theory of the conformal factor. We start\nfrom a formal path integral2\n\nZ\n\nD\u03c7 e\u2212S[\u03c7]\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere S is an arbitrary bare action (perhaps related, but not necessarily identical to SEH )\nand \u03c7(x) denotes the microscopic (\"quantum\") conformal factor field. (The notation \u03c6(x)\nwill be reserved for its expectation value.) We think of (3.1) as descending from a path\nintegral over quantum metrics \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd (x),\nZ\nD\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd e\u2212Sgrav [\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd ] ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nby a restriction to metrics of the form\n\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72\u03bd b\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe integrals (3.1) and (3.2) refer to a spacetime manifold of a given topology and gb\u03bc\u03bd is a\n\nreference metric consistent with this topology. The action S[\u03c7] depends parametrically on\n2\n\nSince this is customary in the literature we shall use a Euclidean notation in the general discussions.\n\nAt the formal level it is trivial to obtain the corresponding Lorentzian formulas by replacing \u2212S \u2192 iS,\n\netc.; for the time being the positivity properties of S play no role.\n\n10\n\n\fg\u03bc\u03bd but we shall not indicate this dependence notationally. The non-dynamical, classical\nb\n\nmetric b\ng\u03bc\u03bd is considered fixed once and for all; it has no analog in the full theory and is\n\nnot to be confused with the background metric and the corresponding conformal factor\nwhich we introduce next.\n\nWe decompose the variable of integration, \u03c7, as the sum of a classical, fixed background field \u03c7B and a fluctuation f :\n\u03c7(x) = \u03c7B (x) + f (x).\n\n(3.4)\n\nEven though we frequently use the term \"fluctuation\", f (x) is not assumed small, and\nno expansion in powers of f (x) is performed here. We assume that the measure D\u03c7 is\nR\ntranslational invariant so that (3.1) can be replaced by Df exp(\u2212S[\u03c7B + f ]). Actually\nit is sufficient to assume that the original D\u03c7 equals a translational invariant measure up\n\nto a Jacobian since we may include the logarithm of this Jacobian in S.\n\nAt this point it is natural to introduce a background\u2013type generating functional by\ncoupling an external source J(x) to the fluctuation only:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\np\n\u0001\nd\ng J(x) f (x) .\nexp W [J; \u03c7B ] = Df exp \u2212S[\u03c7B + f ] + d x b\n\n(3.5)\n\nRepeated differentiation of W with respect to the source yields the connected n-point\nfunctions of f in presence of J. In particular the normalized expectation value of the\nfluctuation is\nf (x) \u2261 hf (x)i = p\n\n1\n\n\u03b4W [J; \u03c7B ]\n.\n\u03b4J(x)\ng (x)\nb\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe field thus obtained is functionally dependent on both J and \u03c7B , i. e. f = f [J; \u03c7B ]. We\nassume that this relationship can be solved for the source, J = J[ f ; \u03c7B ], and introduce\nthe Legendre transform of W :\nZ\np\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng J[ f ; \u03c7B ](x) f (x) \u2212 W J[ f ; \u03c7B ]; \u03c7B .\n\u0393[ f ; \u03c7B ] = dd x b\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis definition implies the effective field equation\n\n\u03b4\u0393[ f ; \u03c7B ]\n= J(x).\n\u03b4f (x)\n\n11\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fMore generally, repeated differentiation of \u0393 with respect to f (x) yields the 1PI n-point\ncorrelators of f in presence of J. The source can be \"switched off\" by equating f after\nthe differentiations to the function f 0 [\u03c7B ](x) \u2261 f [J = 0; \u03c7B ](x). Note that f 0 has no\n\nreason to vanish in general, and that the resulting n-point functions still depend on \u03c7B .\nThe expectation value of the complete conformal factor reads\n\u03c6 \u2261 (\u03c7B + f ) = \u03c7B + f ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nand sometimes it will be convenient to regard \u0393 a functional of \u03c6 and \u03c7B rather than f\nand \u03c7B :\n\u0393[\u03c6, \u03c7B ] \u2261 \u0393[ f = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c7B ; \u03c7B ].\n\n(3.10)\n\nFor the restriction of this function to equal arguments \u03c6 = \u03c7B which amounts to a\nvanishing fluctuation expectation value we write\n\u0393 [\u03c6] \u2261 \u0393[\u03c6, \u03c6] = \u0393[ f = 0; \u03c7B = \u03c6].\n\n(3.11)\n\nIt is instructive to compare the above generating functionals in the background\napproach with those in the standard (\"st\"), i. e. non-background formalism. There one\nwould define Wst [J] by\n\u0001\n\nexp Wst [J] =\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\nD\u03c7 exp \u2212S[\u03c7] +\n\nZ\n\nd\n\nd x\n\np\n\ng J(x) \u03c7(x)\nb\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.12)\n\nand the standard effective action \u0393st [\u03c6] would obtain as the Legendre transform of Wst [J].\nExploiting the translational invariance of D\u03c7 it is easy to see that the two sets of func-\n\ntionals are related in a rather trivial way:\n\nW [J; \u03c7B ] = Wst [J] \u2212\n\u0393[ f ; \u03c7B ] = \u0393st [\u03c7B + f ]\n\nZ\n\ndd x\n\np\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\ng J(x) \u03c7B (x)\nb\n\n\u0393[\u03c6, \u03c7B ] = \u0393st [\u03c6]\n\n\u0393 [\u03c6] = \u0393st [\u03c6].\n\n(3.13)\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n\nThe key property of the background formalism is that the standard n-point functions\n\u03b4 n \u0393st [\u03c6]\n\u03b4\u03c6(x1 ) * * * \u03b4\u03c6(xn )\n\n12\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fcan alternatively be computed by differentiating the functional \u0393[ f = 0; \u03c7B ] = \u0393 [\u03c7B ]\nwith respect to the background \u03c7B :\n\u03b4 n \u0393[ f = 0; \u03c7B ]\n\u03b4\u03c7B (x1 ) * * * \u03b4\u03c7B (xn )\n\n\u03c7B =\u03c6\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03b4 n \u0393st [\u03c6]\n.\n\u03b4\u03c6(x1 ) * * * \u03b4\u03c6(xn )\n\n(3.17)\n\nIn the case at hand the equality of (3.16) and (3.17) is trivial since \u0393[ f = 0; \u03c7B ] and\n\u0393st [\u03c7B ] are exactly equal here.\nThe situation is less trivial when one applies this formalism to gauge theories, employing a gauge fixing term invariant under background gauge transformations. Then the\nanalogs of the n-point functions (3.16) and (3.17) are not exactly equal, but they are equal\n\"on-shell\". As a result, both sets of correlators give rise to the same set of physical Smatrix elements [45]. The important conclusion is that even then the functional \u0393 which\nobtains by requiring that the fluctuation has no expectation value ( f = 0) and depends\nonly on one field (\u03c7B \u2261 \u03c6) contains all of the physical, gauge\u2013invariant information.\n\nBefore continuing let us summarize the status of the various metrics, all conformal\n\nb\u03bc\u03bd , a\nto one another, that enter the construction. First, there is the reference metric g\nclassical field which is fixed once and for all and never gets varied. Second, there is the\nquantum metric, the integration variable\n\n\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72\u03bd b\ng\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c7B + f )2\u03bd b\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(3.18)\n\nIn the canonical approach this metric corresponds to an operator. Third, there is the\nbackground metric defined by\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03c72\u03bd\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\nB b\n\n(3.19)\n\nIt is a classical field again which is considered variable, however. In particular it can be\nadjusted to achieve f = 0 if this is desired. Fourth, there is the expectation value of\nthe quantum metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 h\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd i \u2261 (\u03c7B + f )2\u03bd b\n\n(3.20)\n\nAnd finally, fifth, there is the metric with the conformal factor \u03c6. As \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c7B + f =\n\n\u03c7B + hf i, it reads\n\n\u011f\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03c62\u03bd gb\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03c7B + hf i\n13\n\n\u00012\u03bd\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\nb\n\n(3.21)\n\n\fIn general g\u03bc\u03bd and \u011f\u03bc\u03bd are not exactly equal. However, they are approximately equal if\nthe quantum fluctuations of f are small. In d = 4 where \u03bd = 1, for instance, we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd + 2 \u03c7B hf i + f 2 gb\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u011f\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ 2 \u03c7B hf i + hf i2 b\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(3.22)\n\nHence the difference g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u011f\u03bc\u03bd = [hf 2 i \u2212 hf i2 ] b\ng\u03bc\u03bd is proportional to the variance of f\n\nso that g\u03bc\u03bd and \u011f\u03bc\u03bd are not very different if the fluctuations of f are \"small\". However,\nin order to make this statement precise one first would have to give a meaning to the\nexpectation value of the operator product f 2 with both operators at the same point,\n\nsomething we shall not attempt here. Notice also that \u011f\u03bc\u03bd reduces to g \u03bc\u03bd if f = 0 while\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\ng\u03bc\u03bd does not: g\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd + hf 2 i b\n\nThe metrics g\u03bc\u03bd and g \u03bc\u03bd are analogous to the fields with the same names in the con-\n\nstruction of the exact gravitational average action [6]. Certain differences arise, however,\nsince there a linear background\u2013quantum split is performed at the level of the full metric,\nwhile in the present approach the split is linear at the level of the conformal factor. In\nref. [6] where the integral over all metrics \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd is dealt with, one decomposes \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd +h\u03bc\u03bd\nand then integrates over the fluctuation h\u03bc\u03bd . As a result, g\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd i = g \u03bc\u03bd + hh\u03bc\u03bd i is\n\nlinear in the expectation value of the fluctuation so that there is no difference between g\u03bc\u03bd\n\nand \u011f\u03bc\u03bd . In the present setting, on the other hand, the metric \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd is parameterized by the\nfluctuation in a nonlinear way: \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c7B + f )2\u03bd b\ng\u03bc\u03bd . This nonlinearity is the price we\n\nhave to pay if we want the CREH action to look like that of a standard scalar \u03c64 -theory.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Average Action of the Conformal Factor\nFrom the technical point of view, the main problem consists in (approximately)\n\ncomputing the path integral (3.5). Next we shall set up an RG formalism which translates\nthis problem into the equivalent problem of solving a certain functional RG equation\nsubject to a boundary condition involving S.\n(A) Introducing a mode cutoff Using a variant of the effective average action for\nscalars [28, 29] we modify (3.5) by introducing a mode\u2013cutoff term into the path integral\n\n14\n\n\fdefining W :\n\u0001\nexp Wk [J; \u03c7B ]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\np\nd\n= Df exp \u2212S[\u03c7B + f ] \u2212 \u2206k S[f ; \u03c7B ] + d x b\ng J(x) f (x) .\n\n(3.23)\n\nThe action \u2206k S[f ; \u03c7B ] is to be constructed in such a way that the factor exp(\u2212\u2206k S)\nsuppresses the long\u2013wavelength modes of f (x) with momenta p . k while it does not\naffect the short\u2013wavelength modes with p & k. In order to arrive at an FRGE of the\nfamiliar second\u2013order type we take \u2206k S to be quadratic in f :\nZ\np\n1\n\u2206k S[f ; \u03c7B ] = 2 dd x b\ng f (x) Rk [\u03c7B ] f (x).\n\n(3.24)\n\nHere Rk is a pseudodifferential operator which may depend on the background field.\nAllowing for this \u03c7B -dependence is crucial in order to implement \"background indepen-\n\ndence\" [2\u20134] and to give a \"proper\" meaning to the coarse graining scale k in a theory\nwith a dynamical metric.\n(B) Giving a meaning to k In flat space the parameter k, by elementary Fourier\ntheory, has the interpretation of the inverse length scale over which the microscopic fields\nare averaged or \"coarse grained\". If we want to have a similar interpretation in quantum\ngravity we must decide with respect to which metric this length scale is measured. In the\nbackground field approach, there is a canonical candidate for a metric measuring the coarse\ng\u03bc\u03bd . In fact, as we discussed in\ngraining scale, namely the background metric g \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72\u03bd\nB b\n\nthe Introduction, the RG flow becomes \"background independent\" (in the sense of [2\u20134])\nif \u2206k S is constructed from g \u03bc\u03bd , or \u03c7B here, rather than from a rigid metric. The key\n\nproperty of Rk [\u03c7B ] is to distinguish \"long\u2013wavelength\" and \"short\u2013wavelength\" modes\n\nof f (x) whereby the \"length\" is defined in terms of g \u03bc\u03bd , i. e. the background conformal\n\nfactor \u03c7B .\nThe advantage of using the background field method is that at an intermediate\nstage it decouples the field integrated over, the fluctuation f , from the field that fixes the\nphysical value of k, namely \u03c7B . At the very end, after the quantization has been performed\nand the RG trajectories are known, we may set f = 0 without loosing information. Then\nthe scale dependent version of the single\u2013argument functional defined above, \u0393k [\u03c6 \u2261\n\n15\n\n\f\u03c7B ], depends only on one conformal factor, corresponding to \"the\" metric g\u03bc\u03bd , and its\nparameter k is a momentum measured, indirectly, with respect to this metric.\n(C) Which spectrum is cut off ? A cutoff operator Rk with the desired properties\n\ncan be constructed along the following lines. We think of the functional integral (3.23)\nover f as being organized according to eigenfunctions of the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator\nconstructed from g \u03bc\u03bd :\n\u0003 \u2261 g \u22121/2 \u2202\u03bc g 1/2 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd .\n\n(3.25)\n\nExpanding f in terms of (\u2212\u0003 )-eigenfunctions, the task of Rk is to suppress those with\n\neigenvalues smaller than k 2 by giving them a \"mass\" of the order k, while those with larger\n\neigenvalues must remain \"massless\" [28, 29]. In the simplest case when the f -modes have\na kinetic operator proportional to \u0003 itself the rule is that the correct Rk when added to\n(2)\n\n\u0393k leads to the replacement\n\n(\u2212\u0003 ) \u2212\u2192 (\u2212\u0003 ) + k 2 R(0)\n\n\u2212\u0003\nk2\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\n(3.26)\n\nHere R(0) (z) is an arbitrary \"shape function\" interpolating between R(0) (0) = 1 and\nR(0) (\u221e) = 0, with a transition region centered around z = 1. These conditions guarantee\nthat the effective inverse propagator of the long\u2013 and short\u2013wavelength modes is \u2212\u0003 + k 2\n\nand \u2212\u0003, respectively, and that the long/short\u2013transition is at the \u2212\u0003-eigenvalue k 2 , as\nit should be.\n\nThe coarse graining scale l = l(k) corresponding to the cutoff value k is found\nby investigating the properties of the \u2212\u0003-eigenfunction with eigenvalue k 2 , the so-called\n\n\"cutoff mode\" [22, 23]: one determines its typical scale of variation with respect to x (a\nperiod, say) and converts this coordinate length to a physical, i. e. proper length using g \u03bc\u03bd .\nThe result, l(k), is an approximate measure for the extension of the spacetime volumes\nup to which the dynamics has been \"coarse grained\". If g \u03bc\u03bd is close to a flat metric, l(k)\nequals approximately \u03c0/k. (See [22, 23] for a detailed discussion.) It is in this sense that\nthe background metric g \u03bc\u03bd , or rather its conformal factor \u03c7B , determines the physical\n(proper) scale of k.\nDefining the scale k as a cutoff in the spectrum of the covariant Laplacian built from\n\n16\n\n\fg \u03bc\u03bd is in accord with the construction of the exact gravitational average action in [6]; there,\ntoo, it is the background metric which sets the scale of k.\n(D) Matter fields vs. quantized gravity While the above choice of Rk appears very\n\nnatural, and in fact is the only meaningful one in the gravitational context, every standard quantization and RG scheme which treats \u03c6 as an ordinary scalar uses a differently\nb Here \u0003\nb denotes the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operdefined cutoff, namely one based upon \u0003.\n\nb = gb \u22121/2 \u2202\u03bc b\nator pertaining to the reference metric, \u0003\ng 1/2 b\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd , and Rk is designed to\nimplement the replacement\n\nb \u2212\u2192 (\u2212\u0003)\nb + k 2 R(0)\n(\u2212\u0003)\n\nb\n\u2212\u0003\nk2\n\n\u0001\n.\n\n(3.27)\n\nIn this case the proper scale of k is determined by the metric b\ng\u03bc\u03bd which, however, at no\n\nstage of the construction acquires any physical meaning. As we emphasized, b\ng\u03bc\u03bd is never\n\nvaried. It \"knows\" nothing about the true (\"on-shell\") metric of spacetime, namely the\n\nparticular background metric which adjusts itself dynamically upon setting hf i = 0. The\n\nscheme (3.27) is the correct choice if one considers \u03c7 a standard scalar field on a non-\n\ndynamical spacetime with metric gb\u03bc\u03bd , on flat space (b\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ), for instance. The average\n\naction formalism based upon (3.27) reproduces all the familiar results of perturbation\ntheory, the ln(k)-running of the quartic coupling in \u03c64 -theory, for instance.\n\nSince b\ng\u03bc\u03bd is a rigid metric, the flow resulting from the substitution (3.27) is not\n\n\"background independent\" in the sense of [2\u20134], while (3.26) does indeed give rise to a\n\"background independent\" RG flow.\n\nAs we shall see, the flow based upon the \u0003-scheme (3.26) is extremely different from\nthe one for standard scalars. The reason is, of course, that via the \u03c7B -dependence of \u0003\nthe gravitational field itself sets the scale of k. The difference between (3.26) and (3.27)\ng\u03bc\u03bd are related\nbecomes manifest when we recall that the Laplacians of b\ng\u03bc\u03bd and g \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c72\u03bd\nB b\nby\n\nb + O(\u2202\u03c7B ).\n\u0003 = \u03c7\u22122\u03bd\n\u0003\nB\n\n(3.28)\n\nThe factor \u03c7\u22122\u03bd\nleads to dramatic modifications of the RG flow whereas the O(\u2202\u03c7B )-terms\nB\nare less important; within the Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation they play no role.\n\n17\n\n\f(E) Defining \u0393k The remaining steps of the construction follow the familiar rules [28,\n29, 31].

In particular, differentiating (3.23) with\nrespect to k leads to the following FRGE which governs the scale dependence of \u0393k :\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0015\n\u0011\u22121\n(2)\n1\nk\u2202k \u0393k [ f ; \u03c7B ] = 2 Tr \u0393k [ f ; \u03c7B ] + Rk [\u03c7B ]\nk\u2202k Rk [\u03c7B ] .\n(3.33)\n(2)\n\nHere \u0393k is the matrix of second functional derivatives of \u0393k [ f ; \u03c7B ] with respect to f at\nfixed \u03c7B .

Notice also that, since the f -derivatives\nCorrespondingly Tr(* * * ) \u2261 d x b\n\nare to be performed at fixed \u03c7B , the FRGE (3.33) cannot be formulated in terms of\nthe single\u2013argument functional \u0393k alone. Hence the relevant theory space consists of\nfunctionals depending on two fields, f and \u03c7B , or alternatively \u03c6 and \u03c7B .\n\n18\n\n\fBy construction Rk vanishes for k \u2192 0. As a consequence, \u0393k reduces to the ordinary\n\neffective action in this limit:\n\n\u0393k=0 [ f ; \u03c7B ] = \u0393[ f ; \u03c7B ]\n(3.35)\n\u0393k=0 [\u03c6] = \u0393 [\u03c6].\nHence \u0393k\u21920 and \u0393k\u21920 satisfy the relations (3.14) and (3.15), respectively. They entail\nthat \u0393k=0 [ f ; \u03c7B ] actually depends on the sum \u03c7B + f only. This is not true for k 6= 0, the\nreason being that in general \u2206k S[f ; \u03c7B ] depends on f and \u03c7B separately, not only on their\n\nsum. In the opposite limit k \u2192 \u221e, \u0393k [ f ; \u03c7B ] approaches S[\u03c7B + f ] plus a computable\ncorrection term, see [52] for a detailed discussion of this point.\n\n4\n\nThe CREH Truncation\n\n4.1\n\nThe Ansatz for \u0393k\nIn this section we specialize the as to yet exact flow equation (3.33) for the \"CREH\n\ntruncation\"3 . It involves two approximations:\n1. The usual Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation.\n2. The conformal reduction: only the conformal factor is quantized while all other\ndegrees of freedom contained in the metric as well as the Faddeev\u2013Popov ghost\nfields are neglected.\nTo make the presentation as transparent as possible we specialize for d = 4 in the following.\nThe truncation ansatz for \u0393k [ f ; \u03c7B ] is given by the reduced functional SEH [\u03c7B + f ]\nfrom eq.

The first step consists in inserting\nthe ansatz into the flow equation, both on its LHS, where we get k-derivatives of Gk and\n\u039bk , and on its RHS where we are left with the problem of calculating a functional trace\n(2)\n\ninvolving \u0393k . It is sufficient to compute this trace in a derivative expansion which retains\nonly those terms which are also present on the LHS of the flow equation, namely those\nb \u03c62 , and \u03c64 where \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c7B + f . If we then equate\nb \u03c6, R\nproportional to the monomials \u03c6 \u0003\nthe coefficients of equal monomials on the LHS and RHS we find the desired RG equations\nof Gk and \u039bk .\n\n(B) The derivative expansion Without loosing information this calculation can be\nperformed with a homogeneous background field: \u03c7B (x) = const \u2261 \u03c7B .

[54]:\nR(0) (z) = (1 \u2212 z) \u03b8(1 \u2212 z).\n\n(4.12)\n\nIt is convenient to express the coupled system of differential equations for Newton's constant and the cosmological constant in terms of the dimensionless couplings\ng k \u2261 k 2 Gk ,\n\n\u03bbk \u2261 \u039bk /k 2 .\n\n(4.13)\n\nThis choice of variables makes the system autonomous:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nk\u2202k gk = \u03b2g (gk , \u03bbk ) = 2 + \u03b7N (gk , \u03bbk ) gk\n\nk\u2202k \u03bbk = \u03b2\u03bb (gk , \u03bbk ).\n\n(4.14)\n(4.15)\n\nFor the anomalous dimension coming from the kinetic term we obtain explicitly\n(kin)\n\u03b7N (gk , \u03bbk )\n\ngk \u03bb2k\n2\n.\n=\u2212\n3\u03c0 (1 \u2212 2\u03bbk )4\n\n(4.16)\n\nThe one derived from the potential has the familiar structure [6]\n(pot)\n\n\u03b7N\n\n(gk , \u03bbk ) =\n\ngk B1 (\u03bbk )\n1 \u2212 gk B2 (\u03bbk )\n\n(4.17)\n\nwith the following B-functions:\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03bbk\n4\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bbk )2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03bbk\n.\nB2 (\u03bbk ) = \u2212\n12\u03c0 3\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bbk )2\n\n1\nB1 (\u03bbk ) =\n3\u03c0\n\n(4.18a)\n(4.18b)\n\nFor \u03b2\u03bb one finds\ngk\n\u03b2\u03bb (gk , \u03bbk ) = \u2212 (2 \u2212 \u03b7N ) \u03bbk +\n4\u03c0\n\n23\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03b7N\n6\n1 \u2212 2\u03bbk\n\n(4.19)\n\n\f(kin)\n\nwhere either \u03b7N\n\n(kin)\n\nUsing \u03b7N\n\n(pot)\n\nor \u03b7N\n\nis to be inserted for \u03b7N .\n\nthe \u03b2-functions have poles at \u03bb = 1/2 and are regular otherwise. The\n\nphysically relevant part of the parameter space is the half plane to the left of this line\n(\u03bb < 1/2), as in the full theory [9].\n(pot)\n\nWith \u03b7N\n\nthe boundary of the \"physical\" parameter space is given by a curve to\n(pot)\n\nthe left of the \u03bb = 1/2\u2013line.

Parameterizing this curve as g = g\u03b7\ng\u03b7(pot) (\u03bb) = 12\u03c0\n\ndiverges there,\n\n(\u03bb) we have explicitly\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bb)2\n.\n\u03bb \u2212 1/3\n\n(4.20)\n\nIn either of the two cases, the existence of a boundary in (g, \u03bb)-space entails that\nsome of the RG trajectories terminate already at a finite value of k when they run into the\nboundary line. Within the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation, the status of the singularities\nhas been discussed in detail in the literature [9,14,19,41]. They have been interpreted as a\nbreakdown of the truncation in the infrared. The continuation to k = 0 would presumably\nrequire a more general ansatz for \u0393k .\n\n4.3\n\nComparison with the Standard Scalar FRGE\nOne might wonder how the RG equations for the conformal factor relate to those\n\nfor a standard scalar [31]. The comparison reveals that both the structure of the equation\nand their solutions are quite different in the two cases. We shall see this in more detail\nin Section 5. Here we only mention the most striking deviation.\nLet us consider an RG trajectory in a regime where the anomalous dimension is\nsmall so that we may approximate \u03b7N = 0. (In the next section we shall see that there\nare indeed trajectories with \u03b7N \u2248 0 over a large range of scales.) Then (4.11) integrates\nto Gk = const \u2261 G, and the equation for \u03bbk involves the correspondingly simplified\n\n\u03b2-function (4.19), with gk \u2261 G k 2 . In terms of the ordinary, dimensionful cosmological\nconstant \u039bk \u2261 k 2 \u03bbk this RG equation reads\nk\u2202k \u039bk =\n\nG\nk6\n.\n4\u03c0 k 2 \u2212 2\u039bk\n\n24\n\n(4.21)\n\n\fIn particular, when \u039bk \u226a k 2 it simplifies to\nk\u2202k \u039bk =\n\n1\nG k4.\n4\u03c0\n\n(4.22)\n\nObviously the RG equations of the CREH truncation imply a quartic running of the cosmological constant as long as \u039b is small and G is approximately constant.\nWith quantum gravity in the back of our mind this result is no surprise. It is\nexactly what one finds in the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation [6], except for the prefactor\nof G k 4 which is anyhow non-universal. In fact, the k 4 -running (4.22) is what all methods\nfor summing zero\u2013point energies would agree upon. In particular it can be seen as a\nreflection of the well known quartic divergences which appear in all Feynman diagram\ncalculations (and are usually \"renormalized away\"). So there can be no doubt that (4.22)\nis the physically correct answer for the regime considered.\nOn the other hand, from the scalar field perspective, the quartic running is a surprise. In the CREH ansatz for \u0393k the cosmological constant \u039bk plays the role of a \u03c64 coupling constant which behaves as \u039bk \u221d k 4 here. This very strong scale dependence has\n\nto be contrasted with the much weaker, merely logarithmic k-dependence one finds in an\nordinary scalar theory on a 4-dimensional flat spacetime (provided k is above all mass\nthresholds, if any).\nThe origin of this significant difference in the RG running of the \u03c64 -coupling, proportional to ln(k) for a standard scalar and \u221d k 4 for the conformal factor, is clear: The\n\nconformal factor determines the proper scale of the cutoff, while a scalar matter field does\nnot. When we constructed the operator Rk in Subsection 4.2 we explained how the special\n\nstatus of the conformal factor comes into play. We saw that if the coarse graining scale\n\nis to be given a physical meaning, k should be a cutoff in the spectrum of the background\nfield dependent operator \u0003, and this led to the substitution rule (3.26).\nThus it becomes obvious that \"background independence\" leads to RG equations\ndifferent from those of a scalar matter field. In the construction of the exact gravitational\naverage action in [6] where all degrees of freedom carried by the metric are quantized\n\"background independence\" has likewise been taken care of. There it is the full background metric g \u03bc\u03bd , the generalization of \u03c72B here, which enters Rk and sets the scale of\n\n25\n\n\fk.\n\n5\n\nAsymptotic Safety in the CREH Truncation\nIn this section we analyze the physical contents of the RG flow in the CREH trun-\n\ncation, being particularly interested in the asymptotic safety issue.\n\n5.1\n\nAntiscreening\nFrom the definition (4.11) it follows that the RG running of the dimensionful Newton\n\nconstant is given by\nk\u2202k Gk = \u03b7N Gk .\n\n(5.1)\n\nIf \u03b7N > 0, Newton's constant increases with increasing mass scale k, while it decreases\nif \u03b7N < 0. In analogy with gauge theory one refers to the first case as \"screening\", the\nsecond as \"antiscreening\". In the full4 calculation, \u03b7N was of the antiscreening type in the\nentire physical part of the (g, \u03bb)-plane.\n(kin)\n\nIf we determine \u03b7N from the kinetic term, the corresponding CREH result \u03b7N\n\nis negative for any value of g > 0 and \u03bb. This corresponds to the antiscreening case: Newton's constant decreases at high energies. So the remarkable result is that the quantization\nof the conformal factor alone is already sufficient to obtain gravitational antiscreening.\nThe spin-2 character of the metric field seems not essential and its selfinteractions (verR\n\u221a\ntices) coming from d4 x g R seem not to play the dominant role.\nIf we take the \u03b7N from the potential we find that, if g > 0,\n(pot)\n\n(pot)\n\nThe anomalous dimension \u03b7N\n4\n\n\u03b7N\n\n\u2264 0,\n\nif \u03bb \u2265 1/4,\n\n(pot)\n\u03b7N\n\n> 0,\n\nif \u03bb < 1/4.\n\n(5.2)\n\nvanishes along the line \u03bb = 1/4.\n\nHere and in the following \"full calculation\" always refers to the complete calculation within the\n\nEinstein\u2013Hilbert truncation in ref. [6].\n\n26\n\n\f5.2\n\nFixed Points\nNext we search for fixed points of the system of differential equations (4.14), (4.15),\n\ni. e. points (g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ) such that \u03b2g (g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ) = 0 = \u03b2\u03bb (g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ).\nFrom (4.16), (4.18), and (4.19) it is obvious that for either choice of \u03b7N the system\nhas a fixed point at the origin, referred to as the Gaussian Fixed Point (GFP): g\u2217GFP =\n\u03bbGFP\n= 0.\n\u2217\nA Non-Gaussian Fixed Point (NGFP), if any, would satisfy the condition \u03b2g = 0\nwith non-zero values of g\u2217 or \u03bb\u2217 such that \u03b7N (g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ) = \u22122. Upon inserting \u03b7N = \u22122 into\n(4.19) the condition \u03b2\u03bb = 0 assumes the simple form\n\ng\u2217 = 12\u03c0 \u03bb\u2217 (1 \u2212 2\u03bb\u2217 ) .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe second condition for g\u2217 and \u03bb\u2217 depends on the choice for \u03b7N .\nIf we use the \u03b7N from the kinetic term given by eq. (4.16) the condition\n(kin)\n\u03b7N (g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 )\n\n= \u22122 reads\ng\u2217\n\n\u03bb2\u2217\n= 3\u03c0.\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bb\u2217 )4\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe system of equations (5.3), (5.4) is easily decoupled by inserting g\u2217 of (5.3) into (5.4).\nRemarkably, one does indeed find a real solution:\n\u03bb\u2217 =\n\n21/3\n1\n\u2248 0.279\n2 (1 + 21/3 )\n\ng\u2217 = 6\u03c0\n\n21/3\n(1 + 21/3 )\n\n2\n\n\u2248 4.650\n\n(5.5a)\n(5.5b)\n\nThe existence of this NGFP comes as a true surprise; it has no counterpart in ordinary\n4-dimensional \u03c64 -theory.\nIf instead we use the \u03b7N from the potential given by (4.17) with (4.18) the\n(pot)\n\ncondition \u03b7N\n\n(g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ) = \u22122 can be written as\ng \u2217 \u03bb\u2217 \u2212\n\n5\n18\n\n\u0001\n\n= 4\u03c0 (1 \u2212 2\u03bb\u2217 )2 .\n\n27\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fThe coupled equations (5.6) and (5.3) can be solved analytically again and they, too, give\nrise to real and positive fixed point coordinates:\n\u03bb\u2217 =\n\n\u0011\n7 \u0010p\n481/49 \u2212 1 \u2248 0.415\n36\n\ng\u2217 = 12\u03c0 \u03bb\u2217 (1 \u2212 2\u03bb\u2217 ) \u2248 2.665\n\n(5.7a)\n(5.7b)\n\nThe individual values of g\u2217 and \u03bb\u2217 as obtained from the two calculational schemes\ndo not quite agree. However, this does not come unexpected. The mere coordinates of\nthe fixed point are not directly related to anything observable and, in fact, are scheme\ndependent or \"non-universal\". On the other hand, the product g\u2217 \u03bb\u2217 has been argued [8,10]\nto be universal and can be measured in principle. And indeed, the products of the numbers\nin (5.5) and in (5.7) agree almost perfectly within the precision one could reasonably\nexpect:\n(g\u2217 \u03bb\u2217 )(kin) \u2248 1.296,\n\n(g\u2217 \u03bb\u2217 )(pot) \u2248 1.106\n\n(5.8)\n\nAccording to both calculations the respective NGFP is always located within the\nphysical part of the (g, \u03bb)-plane.\nIt is straightforward to generalize the calculations for arbitrary dimensionalities d,\nsee ref. [24]. The numerical results for d between 3 and 10 are displayed in Table 1. In\nall dimensions considered a NGFP is found to exist, with g\u2217 > 0 and \u03bb\u2217 > 0. For each\nvalue of d, the table contains the results obtained within the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert (EH)\ntruncation as well as the \"pot\" and \"kin\" variants of the CREH truncation. It contains\n2/(d\u22122)\n\nalso the generalization of g\u2217 \u03bb\u2217 , namely \u03c4d \u2261 \u03bb\u2217 g\u2217\n\nof the dimensionless combination\n\n2/(d\u22122)\n\u039b k Gk\n\n=\n\nwhich is the fixed point value\n\n2/(d\u22122)\n.\n\u03bbk g k\n\n(Note that in d dimensions\n\ngk = k d\u22122 Gk and \u03bbk = k \u22122 \u039bk .) It is impressive to see how well the \"pot\" and \"kin\"\nvalues of \u03c4d agree for any d \u2265 4. As compared to the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert result, the\n\n\u03c4d -values are always larger by about a factor of 10.\n\nWe interpret this factor as indicating that the conformal factor is not the only degree\nof freedom driving the formation of a NGFP, but its contribution is typical in the sense\nthat it leads to an RG flow which is qualitatively similar to the full one.\n\n28\n\n\fd\n\nTrunc.\n\ng\u2217\n\n3\n\nfull EH\n\n0.202139\n\n0.0651806 0.00266329\n\nCREH, pot\n\n0.172872\n\nCREH, kin\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\u03b8\u2032\n\n\u03b8 \u2032\u2032\n\n1.11664\n\n0.827598\n\n0.233092\n\n0.00696588 -3.54754\n\n4.92795\n\n0.391798\n\n0.126945\n\n0.0194868\n\n2.04572\n\n3.60445\n\nfull EH\n\n0.707321\n\n0.193201\n\n0.136655\n\n1.4753\n\n3.04321\n\nCREH, pot\n\n2.6654\n\n0.41477\n\n1.10553\n\n1.47122\n\n9.30442\n\nCREH, kin\n\n4.65005\n\n0.278753\n\n1.29622\n\n4.0\n\n6.1837\n\nfull EH\n\n2.85863\n\n0.234757\n\n0.472851\n\n2.76008\n\n5.12941\n\nCREH, pot\n\n26.9696\n\n0.557727\n\n5.01577\n\n5.81627\n\n12.0556\n\nCREH, kin\n\n42.3258\n\n0.417188\n\n5.06681\n\n6.27681\n\n8.6899\n\nfull EH\n\n13.8555\n\n0.255477\n\n0.950958\n\n4.48592\n\n7.07967\n\nCREH, pot\n\n243.547\n\n0.674559\n\n10.5272\n\n10.8493\n\n14.3777\n\nCREH, kin\n\n361.57\n\n0.537523\n\n10.221\n\n8.81712\n\n11.1844\n\nfull EH\n\n76.3589\n\n0.269073\n\n1.5241\n\n6.51007\n\n8.9431\n\nCREH, pot\n\n2134.67\n\n0.77282\n\n16.5886\n\n17.0223\n\n15.9635\n\nCREH, kin\n\n3069.3\n\n0.641211\n\n15.9154\n\n11.591\n\n13.6754\n\nfull EH\n\n464.662\n\n0.279376\n\n2.16389\n\n8.78536\n\n10.7446\n\nCREH, pot\n\n18744.8\n\n0.857143\n\n22.7691\n\n24.6444\n\n16.0092\n\nCREH, kin\n\n26451.9\n\n0.730796\n\n21.7745\n\n14.5789\n\n16.1597\n\nfull EH\n\n3066.23\n\n0.287851\n\n2.85326\n\n11.2969\n\n12.4932\n\nCREH, pot\n\n167205.0\n\n0.930559\n\n28.9135\n\n33.9881\n\n12.4239\n\nCREH, kin\n\n233516.0\n\n0.808694\n\n27.6432\n\n17.7666\n\n18.6307\n\nfull EH\n\n21673.5\n\n0.295179\n\n3.58153\n\n14.044\n\n14.1871\n\nCREH, pot 1.52489*106\n\n0.995177\n\n34.9712\n\n2.11943*106\n\n0.876935\n\n33.4597\n\n21.1433\n\n21.0813\n\nCREH, kin\n\n\u03bb\u2217\n\nTable 1:\n\n29\n\n\u03c4d\n\n\f5.3\n\nCritical Exponents of the NGFP\nThe properties of the RG flow on (g, \u03bb)-space linearized about the NGFP are deter-\n\nmined by the stability matrix\nB=\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u2202\u03b2\u03bb\n\uf8f0 \u2202\u03bb\n\u2202\u03b2g\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u2202\u03b2\u03bb\n\u2202g \uf8fb\n\u2202\u03b2g\n\u2202g\n\n(5.9)\n\nevaluated at (g\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ). Using the same notation as in [8, 9] we write the corresponding\neigenvalue problem as B V = \u2212\u03b8 V and refer to the negative eigenvalues \u03b8 as the \"critical\n\nexponents\". In general B is not expected to be symmetric.\n\nEmploying the \u03b7N from the kinetic term the resulting eigenvalues are non-zero\nand complex. The two critical exponents \u03b81,2 = \u03b8\u2032 \u00b1 i\u03b8\u2032\u2032 form a complex conjugate pair\nwith real and imaginary parts given by, respectively,\n\u03b8\u2032 = 4,\n\n\u221a p\n\u03b8\u2032\u2032 = 2 2 1 + 3 * 21/3 \u2248 6.1837\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe positive real part indicates that the NGFP is UV attractive (attractive for k \u2192 \u221e)\nin both directions of the (g, \u03bb)-plane. The non-vanishing imaginary part implies that near\n\nthe NGFP the RG trajectories are spirals. This is exactly the same pattern as in the full\nEinstein\u2013Hilbert truncation [9].\nUsing instead the \u03b7N from the potential we find the same qualitative behavior,\nbut the exponents are somewhat different:\n\u03b8\u2032 \u2248 1.471,\n\n\u03b8\u2032\u2032 \u2248 9.304\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe discrepancy between (5.10) and (5.11) can serve as a rough measure for the\naccuracy of the calculation. First of all it is gratifying to see that both calculations lead\nto the same qualitative behavior: attractivity in both directions of parameter space, and\na non-zero imaginary part. Numerically, the values for \u03b8\u2032 and \u03b8\u2032\u2032 probably can be trusted\nonly within a factor of 2 or so. In Table 1 we display the critical exponents also for the\nother dimensions and compare them to the values in the full calculation.\nIt has to be emphasized, however, that even in an exact treatment of the conformally\nreduced theory the resulting critical exponents would have no reason to agree with those\n\n30\n\n\fg\n15\n\n10\n\n5\nType Ia\n\nType IIa\n\nType IIIa\n\u039b\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 1: The figure shows the RG flow on the (g, \u03bb)-plane which is obtained from the\n(kin)\n\nCREH truncation with \u03b7N\n\n.

The flow is dominated by the NGFP\nand the GFP at the origin, and we can distinguish three types of trajectories spiraling\nout of the NGFP. They are heading for negative, vanishing, and positive cosmological\nconstant, respectively, and correspond exactly to the Type Ia, IIa, and IIIa trajectories\n5\n\nSee the diagram in Fig. 12 of ref.

The trajectories of the CREH Types Ia and IIa extend down to k = 0,\nthose of Type IIIa terminate at a non-zero kterm when they reach \u03bb = 1/2, exactly as in\nthe full theory.\nIf we solve the RG equations with the second version of the anomalous dimension,\n(pot)\n\u03b7N ,\n\nwe obtain the phase portrait shown in Fig. 2. In the vicinity of the GFP and NGFP,\n\nrespectively, the structure of the flow, again, is exactly the same as in the full theory. The\nonly new feature here is that there exist trajectories which begin and end on the boundary\nof the physical part of (g, \u03bb)-space which is given by eq. (4.20). Even though this feature\nis different from the full EH flow we see that the conformal factor drives the flow in the\nsame direction as the full metric and is in this sense representative. It is, however, too\nweak to push the trajectories sufficiently strongly away from the hyperbolic shape they\nhave in absence of any non-trivial RG effects [41].\nThe overall conclusion of this anaysis is that the RG flow implied by the scalar-like\n\n32\n\n\fCREH theory, at least in a neighborhood of the two fixed points, is qualitatively identical\nto that of the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation. In particular both versions of \u03b7N agree on\nthe existence of a NGFP with precisely the properties required for asymptotic safety.\n\n6\n\nSummary\nThe ultimate theory of quantum gravity we are aiming at should be able to explain\n\nrather than merely postulate the spacetime we are living in. Therefore the conceptual\nfoundations of this theory, at no point, should depend on any special non-dynamical\nspacetime. For QEG this entails that the quantization must not involve any distinguished\nmetric, that is, it should be performed in a \"background independent\" way. Within the\nasymptotic safety program one tries to define QEG in terms of an RG trajectory on\nthe theory space of the gravitational average action \u0393k , and this trajectory is supposed to\npossess an ultraviolet fixed point. Since renormalization group concepts are crucial in this\ncontext one is led to ask what is the significance and role of \"background independence\"\nfor RG flows.\nAmong all the fields we use in order to describe Nature the metric enjoys a special\nstatus since it fixes the proper value of any dimensionful physical quantity. When one\napplies the Kadanoff\u2013Wilson interpretation of RG flows as a sequence of consecutive\ncoarse graining steps to quantum gravity one would like to give an, at least approximate,\nphysical meaning to the notion of a coarse graining scale. The effective average action\n\u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd , g \u03bc\u03bd ] meets this requirement by introducing k as a cutoff in the spectrum of the\ncovariant Laplacian pertaining to the background metric g \u03bc\u03bd . Hence the mass scale k\nis \"proper\", in the sense of the \"cutoff modes\" [22, 23], with respect to g \u03bc\u03bd . Therefore\nthe mode suppression term \u2206k S and, as a result, the cutoff operator Rk depend on the\nbackground field in a non-trivial way which has a strong impact on the resulting RG flow.\nWe saw that to some extent asymptotic safety, the formation of a non-Gaussian fixed\npoint, is an essentially \"kinematical\" phenomenon resulting from this g \u03bc\u03bd -dependence of\nthe cutoff operator. This specific g \u03bc\u03bd -dependence is forced upon us by the requirement of\n\"background independence\"; it has no analog in matter field theories on a non-dynamical\n\n33\n\n\fspacetime.\nWe illustrated these issues by means of the CREH truncation which quantizes only\none of the degrees of freedom contained in the metric, the conformal factor. If we proceed\nnaively and ignore the special status of the metric we arrive at the \u03c64 -theory with a\nnegative quartic coupling which, according to Symanzik, is asymptotically free. If, instead,\nthe metric itself is used to set the proper scale of k, then the RG flow is different; in\nparticular there exists a non-Gaussian fixed point which is suitable for the asymptotic\nsafety program.\nIt is quite remarkable that, at the qualitative level, this simple scalar\u2013like theory\nhas exactly the same flow diagram as the full Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation. It is therefore plausible to conjecture that the complicated selfinteractions of the helicity-2 modes,\nanother feature that distinguishes the metric from matter fields, is possibly not at the\nheart of asymptotic safety in gravity. Rather, a \"background independent\" quantization\nscheme seems to be essential.\n\n34\n\n\fReferences\n[1] For a general introduction see C.
