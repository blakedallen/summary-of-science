To achieve the required luminosity in several\nTeV colliders, the phase space of the electron and positron beams must be significantly\nreduced before the beam is accelerated in a main linear accelerator.\nThe technique which could accomplish the required cooling for the linear colliders was\nproposed by R. Palmer and V.Telnov [1, 2] and is laser-Compton cooling. In laser-Compton\ncooling, the beam loses both transverse and longitudinal momentum by Compton scattered\nphotons, during head-on collisions with laser photons. The longitudinal momentum is restored to the beam in a linear accelerator. Since the Compton scattered photons follow\nthe initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread due to much lower energy of\nphotons (a few eV) than the energy of electrons (several GeV), the transverse distribution of\nelectron beams remains almost unchanged and also the angular spread is almost constant.\nConsequently the emittance \u01ebi = \u03c3i \u03c3i\u2032 remains almost unchanged (i = x, y), where \u03c3i , \u03c3i\u2032 the\ntransverse beam size and the angular divergence. At the same time, the electron energy\ndecreases from E0 to Ef . Thus the normalized emittances have decreased as follows\n\u01ebn = \u03b3\u01eb = \u01ebn0 (Ef /E0 ) = \u01ebn0 /C,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01ebn0 , \u01ebn are the initial and final normalized emittances, \u03b3 = E/me c2 , me is electron\nmass, and the factor of the emittance reduction C = E0 /Ef . The method of electron beam\ncooling, repeated many times, allows further reduction of the transverse emittances after\ndamping rings or guns by 1-3 orders of magnitude [2].\nIn this paper, we have evaluated the effects of the laser-Compton interaction for transverse cooling using the Monte Carlo code [3, 4]. The simulation calculates the effects of\nthe nonlinear Compton scattering between the laser photons and the electrons during a\nmulti-cooling stage. Next, we examine the optics for cooling with and without chromatic\ncorrection. The laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC [5] at E0 = 2 GeV is considered in\nsection 4.

The wavelength of laser is assumed to be 0.5 \u03bcm. The parameters of x0 with\nthe electron energies 2 GeV and 5 GeV are 0.076 and 0.19, respectively.\nThe required laser flush energy with ZR \u226a l\u03b3 \u2243 le is [2]\nA = 25\n\nle [mm]\u03bbL [\u03bcm]\n(C \u2212 1) [J],\nE0 [GeV]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere ZR , l\u03b3 (\u223c 2\u03c3L,z ), and le (\u223c 2\u03c3z ) are the Rayleigh length of laser, and the bunch lengths\nof laser and electron beams.

This simulation\ncalculates the effects of the nonlinear Compton scattering between the laser photons and\nthe electrons. We assumed that the laser pulse interacts with the electron bunch in head-on\ncollisions. The \u03b2x and \u03b2y at the IP are fixed to be 0.1 mm. The initial energy spread of the\nelectron beams is 1%. The energy of laser pulse is 20 J. The polarization of the electron\nand laser beams are Pe =1.0 and PL =1.0 (circular polarization), respectively. When the x0\nparameter is small, the spectrum of the scattered photons does not largely depend on the\npolarization combination. In order to accelerate the electron beams to 5 GeV for recovery of\nenergy in the second part, we simply added the energy \u2206E = 5 GeV\u2212Eave for reacceleration,\nwhere Eave is the average energy of the scattered electron beams after the laser-Compton\ninteraction.\nFigure 1 shows the longitudinal distribution of the electrons after the first laser-Compton\nscattering. The average energy of the electron beams is 1.0 GeV and the energy spread \u03b4 is\n0.19. The longitudinal distribution seems to be a boomerang. If we assume a short Rayleigh\nlength of laser pulse, the energy loss of head and tail of beams is small. The number of the\nscattered photons per incoming particle and the photon energy at the first stage are 40 and\n96 MeV (rms energy 140 MeV), respectively.\nThe transverse sizes of the electron beams in the multi-stage cooling are shown in Fig. 2.\nDuring collisions with the laser photons, the transverse distribution of the electrons remains\n6\n\n\fEmittance en,i (m\u00d7rad) (i=x,y)\n\n10-5\n10\n\nen,x\nen,y\n\n-6\n\n10-7\n10-8\n10-9\n10-10\n0\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nStage\n\nFIG. 4: The transverse emittances of the electron beams.\n\n0.1\n\nEmittance en,l (m\u00d7rad)\n\n0.09\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n\n0\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nStage\n\nFIG. 5: The longitudinal emittance of the electron beams.\n\nalmost unchanged.

Figure 5 shows the longitudinal emittance of the electron beams in the multi-stage\ncooling. Due to the increase of the energy spread of the electron beams from 1% to 19%,\nthe longitudinal emittance rapidly increases at the first stage. After the first stage, the\n8\n\n\fnormalized longitudinal emittance is stable. The 6D emittance of the electron beams in the\nmulti-stage cooling is shown in Fig. 6. The second cooling stage has the largest reduction\nfor cooling. The 8th or 9th cooling stages have small reduction for cooling. The initial and\nfinal 6D emittances \u01eb6N are 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221213 (m*rad)3 and 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221219 (m*rad)3 , respectively.\nFigure 7 shows the polarization of the electron beams in the multi-stage cooling.

For the focus and defocus of the beams, we use the final doublet system which\nis similar to that of the final focus system of the future linear colliders [5]. The pole-tip field\nof the final quadrupole BT is limited to 1.2 T and the pole-tip radius a is greater than 3\nmm. The strength of the final quadrupole is\n\u03ba = BT /(aB\u03c1) \u2264 120/E[GeV] [m\u22122 ],\n\n(7)\n\nwhere B, \u03c1, and E are the magnetic field, the radius of curvature, and the energy of the\nelectron beams. In our case, the electron energies in the optics 1, 2, and 3 are 5.0, 1.0, and\n5.0 GeV, respectively and the limit of the strength of the quadrupole in laser cooling is much\nlarger than that of the final quadrupole of the future linear colliders. Due to the low energy\nbeams in laser cooling, the synchrotron radiation from quadrupoles and bends is negligible.\nThe difference of three optical devices is the amount of the energy spread of the beams.\nIn the optics 1,2, and 3, the beams have one, several tens, and a few % energy spread. In\norder to minimize the chromatic aberrations, we need to shorten the length between the\nfinal quadrupole and the IP. In this study, the length from the face of the final quadrupole\nto the IP, l is assumed to be 2 cm. Here we estimated the emittance growth in the optics 2,\nbecause the chromatic effect in the optics 2 is the most serious.

If we set a limit of 200% for \u2206\u01ebi /\u01ebi (i = x, y), the permissible energy\nspread \u03b4x and \u03b4y are 0.11 and 0.012 which mean the momentum band width \u00b122% and\n\u00b12.4%, respectively. The results are not sufficient for cooling at E0 = 5 GeV and C = 5,\nbecause the beams through the defocusing optics have the energy spread of several tens %.\nOn the one hand, the optics can be useful as the optics 1 and 3 with the energy spread of a\nfew %.\n\nB.\n\nOptics with chromaticity correction\n\nThe optics without chromaticity correction for the optics 2 does not work as we seen\nbefore subsection. In this subsection we apply the chromaticity correction for the optics 2.\nThe lattice for cooling is designed referring to the final focus system of the future linear\ncolliders by K. Oide [9]. The final doublet system is the same lattice as the optics before\nsubsection. The method of chromaticity correction uses one family of sextupole to correct\nfor vertical chromaticity and moreover we added two weak sextupoles in the lattice to correct\nfor horizontal chromaticity. Figure 11 shows the defocus optics with chromaticity correction\nfor laser-Compton cooling. The input file is attached to Ref. [7]. The total length of the\nlattice is about 63 m.\nThe momentum dependence of the emittances in the defocus optics with chromaticity\ncorrection is shown in Fig. 12. The 10000 particles are tracked for the transverse and\nlongitudinal Gaussian distribution by the MAD code. The relative energy spread \u03b4 is changed\nfrom 0 to 0.06 with the conservation \u03ba2 \u03b8B , where \u03ba2 and \u03b8B are the strength of the sextupole\n\n12\n\n\fbx\n\nDx\n\nby\n\nDy\n\nD (m)\n\nb (m)\n\n.0050\n\n600.\n\n.0045\n500.\n.0040\n\n.0035\n400.\n.0030\n\n.0025\n\n300.\n\n.0020\n200.\n.0015\n\n.0010\n100.\n.0005\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n10.\n\n20.\n\n30.\n\n40.\n\n50.\n\n60.\n\n70.\n\n80.\ns (m)\n\n200.\n\n1.6\n\nmy\n\nmx\n\nWy\n\nWx\n180.\n\n1.4\n\nm (rad/ 2p)\n\nW\n\nd E/ p 0 c = 0 .\n\n160.\n1.2\n140.\n1.0\n\n120.\n\n100.\n\n.8\n\n80.\n.6\n60.\n.4\n40.\n.2\n\n20.\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n10.\n\n20.\n\n30.\n\n40.\n\n50.\n\n60.\n\n70.\n\n80.\ns (m)\n\n0.0\n\nd E/ p 0 c = 0 .\n\nFIG. 11: The defocus optics with chromaticity correction for laser-Compton cooling.\n\nand the angle of the bending magnet.

The initial and final \u03b1x (y) with no energy spread \u03b4 = 0 are 0 in this optics.\nAfter the chromaticity correction, the chromaticity functions \u03bex and \u03bey are 9.3 and 1.6,\nrespectively.

Where can it be placed? There are two\npossibilities for JLC/NLC [11] as follows:\n1. After the first bunch compressor (BC1) and before the pre-linac. E0 = 2 GeV and\n\u03c3z = 0.5 mm.\n14\n\n\f2. After the second compressor (BC2) and before the main linac. E0 = 10 GeV and\n\u03c3z = 0.1 mm.\nThe case 2 needs a large energy for recovery after Compton scattering and we consider the\ncase 1 in this study. The parameters of the electron and laser beams for laser-Compton\ncooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV and C = 10 are listed in Table I and II. The energy of\nlaser pulse is 300 J. The simulation results of the laser-electron interaction by the CAIN code\nare summarized as follows. The energy spread of the electron beam is 11%. The decrease\nof the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam is 0.038 (Pe = 1.0, PL = 1.0). The\nnumber of the scattered photons per incoming particle and the photon energy are 200 and\n8.9 MeV (rms energy 19 MeV), respectively.\nTABLE IV: Parameters of the defocus optics for laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 =2\nGeV and C = 10.\nl\n\nLength of Q1\n\nField of Q1\n\nAperture\n\nTotal length\n\n5 mm\n\n2 cm\n\n1.2 Tesla\n\n0.5 mm\n\n7.4 cm\n\nThe electron energy after Compton scattering in the case 2 is 0.2 GeV and the strength of\nthe final quadrupole from Eq.

The final \u03b2x\nand \u03b2y are assumed to be 1 m and 0.25 m, respectively. The chromaticity functions \u03bex and\n\u03bey are 18 and 23, respectively.

The emittance growth in the other two-focus optics is negligible.\n\nB.\n\nReacceleration Linac\n\nIn the reacceleration linac, there are two major sources of the emittance increase [11] as\nfollows:\n15\n\n\f1. The emittance growth due to the misalignment of the quadrupole magnet and the\nenergy spread.\n2. The emittance growth due to the cavity misalignment.\nThe emittance growth due to these sources in the reacceleration linac is formulated by\nK.

The decrease of the polarization of the electron beam is 0.038\ndue to the laser-Compton interaction.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have studied the method of laser-Compton cooling of electron beams for future linear\ncolliders. The effects of the laser-Compton interaction for cooling have been evaluated by\nthe Monte Carlo simulation. From the simulation in the multi-stage cooling, we presented\nthat the low emittance beams with \u01eb6N = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221219 (m*rad)3 can be achieved in our beam\nparameters. We also examined the optics with and without chromatic correction for cooling,\nbut the optics are not sufficient for cooling due to the large energy spread of the electron\nbeams.\nThe laser-Compton cooling for JLC/NLC at E0 = 2 GeV and C = 10 was considered.\nThe total reduction factor of the 6D emittance of the laser-Compton cooling is about 13.\nThe decrease of the polarization of the electron beam is 0.038 due to the laser-Compton\ninteraction.\n\n16\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Y.
