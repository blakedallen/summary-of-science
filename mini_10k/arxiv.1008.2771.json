Overall our analysis shows that a shallow cusp is not an unequivocal signature of a central IMBH and casts serious doubts on the usefulness of\nmeasuring \u03bd in the context of the hunt for IMBHs in globular clusters.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeveral observational studies have provided strong evidence for the presence of super9\nmassive black holes with masses MBH in the range 106 <\n\u223c 10 at the centers of\n\u223c MBH /M\u2299 <\nelliptical and spiral galaxies. The masses of these central black holes correlate with the hostgalaxy bulge mass and velocity dispersion (see e.g. G\u00fcltekin et al. 2009). If these correlations\nare extrapolated to smaller stellar systems, globular clusters should harbor intermediate-mass\nblack holes (hereafter IMBHs) with masses in the range 102 \u2212 104 M\u2299 .\nDespite significant observational efforts, conclusive evidence of the presence of IMBHs\nin clusters is still lacking. Observational studies of Galactic clusters have so far provided only\nupper limits on the masses of IMBHs (see van der Marel & Anderson 2010 and references\ntherein). The difficulty of obtaining an unambiguous detection is illustrated by the Omega\nCen case. Based on integrated light spectroscopy from the ground and an HST-based surface\n4\nbrightness profile , Noyola et al. (2008) claimed a 4.0+0.75\n\u22121.0 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 IMBH. However, propermotion-velocity-dispersion data obtained with HST (van del Marel & Anderson, Anderson\n4\n& van der Marel 2010) show that MBH <\n\u223c 1.8 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 (at 3\u03c3 confidence) in contrast with\nthe Noyola et al. result. Outside the Milky Way, the presence of a central IMBH has been\nsuggested for G1, a massive cluster in M31. Here radio, X-ray observations and dynamical\nstudies all suggest the presence of an IMBH with MBH \u223c 2 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 (Gebhardt et al. 2005,\nUlvestad et al. 2007), but because of the limited spatial resolution of the observations (G1\nis at about 800 Kpc, compared to the . 10 Kpc for many Galactic clusters), it is hard to\nprobe the central region with proper motions or star-by-star radial velocities to evaluate the\nrobustness of the G1 IMBH detection.\nGiven the difficulty of achieving a definitive detection of an IMBH, several studies have\nfocused on possible signatures for its presence, both to construct circumstantial evidence\nbased on a coincidence of indicators, as well as to identify a sample of promising candidates for\ndetailed kinematic follow-up. In young clusters, X-ray (ULX) emission due to gas accretion is\nexpected (see e.g. Miller & Colbert 2004). Dynamic signatures are related to the formation\nof a Bahcall-Wolf density cusp (Bahcall & Wolf 1976) within the sphere of influence of\nthe BH. The three-dimensional density cusp induces a shallow cusp ( \u03a3 \u223c R\u03bd , with\n\u22120.3 <\n\u223c \u22120.05) in the projected surface brightness and velocity dispersion (Baumgardt\n\u223c \u03bd <\net al. 2005, Trenti et al. 2007a, Miocchi 2007, Umbreit et al. 2009). In addition, these\nnumerical studies showed that IMBHs can act as a very efficient energy source in clusters\nbecause of enhanced three-body interactions within the BH sphere of influence, supporting\nlarge cores and preventing core-collapse. Finally, Gill et al. (2008) have shown that the\npresence of an IMBH in a globular cluster can quench the process of mass segregation and\nintroduced a new IMBH indicator based on the radial profile of the mean star mass within\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\na cluster. This indicator has been successfully applied to two globular clusters NGC2298\n(Pasquato et al. 2009) and M10 (Beccari et al. 2010), ruling out a M > 300 M\u2299 IMBH (3-\u03c3\nconfidence) in the first case and providing weaker limits in the second.\nAn important property for a reliable IMBH fingerprint is its uniqueness. For example,\nwhile systems in which a small core-to-half-mass radius ratio is observed are unlikely to host\na IMBH, the converse is not necessarily true. Other dynamic processes, primarily two-body\ninteractions of dark remnants with main sequence stars, provide efficient heating on the\nvisible population of stars and may mask the development of core collapse (Trenti et al.\n2010). Motivated by the recent attention given to the presence of shallow central cusps as\nfingerprints of IMBH in a number of observed Galactic and Magellanic Clouds clusters (see\ne.g. Noyola & Gebhardt 2006, 2007, Lanzoni et al. 2007), we discuss in this Letter the\nlikelihood of observing shallow cusps in systems without an IMBH. For this, we take a set\nof direct N-body simulations of star clusters and analyze their surface-brightness profiles as\nwe were \"observing\" them with HST (see Trenti et al. 2010).\nThe outline of this Letter is the following. Section 2 summarizes the setup of our N-body\nsimulations and defines the analysis tools we use. Section 3 presents the results on the time\nevolution of the central slope in the surface brightness profiles. In Section 4 we conclude\nwith a discussion of our results in the context of IMBH searches.\n\n2.\n\nMethod and Initial Conditions\n2.1.\n\nN-body simulations\n\nThe simulations considered here are a subset of those presented in Trenti et al. (2010).\nWe summarize here the main ingredients of our numerical framework. Further details are\nprovided in Trenti et al. (2010).\nWe follow the evolution of star clusters using the direct summation code NBODY6\n(Aarseth 2003) run with its GPU extension on the NCSA Lincoln Cluster. The code models\nthe effects of internal relaxation with an accurate treatment of the multiple interactions\nbetween stars obtained thanks to special regularization techniques.\nThe initial structure of the clusters is that of tidally limited King (1966) models. In\nthe simulations presented here, the initial star masses are drawn either from a Miller &\nScalo (1979) or a Salpeter (1955) initial mass function. Our analysis is focused on the late\nevolutionary stages of clusters as driven by two-body relaxation; before starting the run, we\nperformed an instantaneous step of stellar evolution to evolve the mass function to a 0.8 M\u2299\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nturnoff using the Hurley et al. (2000) evolutionary tracks. The evolution of the clusters has\nbeen followed until either t = 8000 (with the time expressed in N-body units, equivalent to\nthe cluster dynamical time) was reached (corresponding to several initial relaxation times\n- t > 16 trh (0)) or at least 80% of the initial mass was lost due to evaporation of stars.\nIn order to explore the role of primordial hard binaries, our sample of simulations\nincludes systems without primordial binaries as well as systems with an initial fraction of\nbinaries fbin = Nb /N (where Nb is the number of binary stars) ranging from 0 to 0.1. The\nbinaries' binding energy distribution function is flat in log scale between \u01ebmin and 133\u01ebmin\nwhere \u01ebmin = hm(0)i\u03c3c (0)2 where hm(0)i is the initial mean stellar mass and \u03c3c (0) is the\ninitial central velocity dispersion (see Trenti et al. 2007b, 2010).\nIn all the simulations we assumed that all the dark remnants produced are retained in\nthe cluster; the comparison of the results of systems with a Miller-Scalo and a Salpeter initial\nmass function (which have a similar fraction of white dwarfs and neutron stars but produce\na significantly different fraction of stellar-mass black holes: \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 for Miller-Scalo\nand \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for Salpeter) allows us to explore the dependence of our results on the\nfraction of massive dark remnants. One simulation includes an IMBH with mass 1% of the\ntotal cluster mass.\nThe initial properties of the simulations considered here are summarized in Table 1,\nalong with the identification used below to refer to them.\n\n2.2.\n\nData Analysis\n\nIn analysing the structural properties of our simulated clusters, we follow a procedure\naimed at reproducing as closely as possible the steps performed in the analysis of observational data. We construct a synthetic observation by first ignoring all particles except main\nsequence stars. As our simulations only have an instantaneous step of stellar evolution, we\ndo not consider stars along the giant branch. This choice is appropriate to create a surface\nbrightness profile for main sequence stars. Focusing on main sequence stars leads to a significant reduction in the surface brightness profile fluctuations arising from the small number\nof luminous giants that would otherwise dominate the light profile. The mass difference between the upper main-sequence stars we used and the giants should have a negligible effect\non the surface-brightness profile.\nWe then select a random direction, project the main-sequence stars' positions and create a 2-dimensional map. A circular surface brightness profile, \u03a3(R), is constructed using\n\u221a\n2Int[ NM S ] annuli (where NM S is the number of main sequence stars) each containing\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\u221a\n\u223c NM S /2 sources. The center of the system is determined by using the Casertano &\nHut (1985) density-center method. We then determine the King concentration parameter\nc = log10 (rt /rc ) by fitting the surface brightness profile with a single-mass King (1966) model\n(see Trenti et al. 2010 for further details on the construction of the surface brightness profile\nand the fitting procedure and for the time evolution of c).\nThis Letter is focused on the evolution of the inner part of the surface brightness profile.\nSpecifically, we assume that in the inner parts \u03a3(R) \u221d R\u03bd and estimate \u03bd by a fit of \u03a3(R)\nbetween the innermost \u03a3(R) point (typically at 0.05-0.08 rc ) and rc /3 (or using at least\nthe three innermost points) where rc is the King core radius for the best-fit King model.\nPrevious simulations of clusters with an IMBH (Baumgardt et al. 2005) show that shallow\ncusps extend to about rc /3. In order to estimate the range of values of \u03bd obtained with\nthis procedure when a cluster structure is that of a King model, we created 100 different\nrandom realizations of a King model with W0 = 7 and 32K particles. After calculating the\nsurface brightness profile for each system using the same number of annuli used in the data\nanalysis of our simulations, we calculated \u03bd for each random realization using data points\nwithin rc /3. The mean value of \u03bd obtained is \u223c \u22120.05 with a dispersion of \u223c 0.07. Note\nthat a small but non-zero value of \u03bd for a King model is to be expected. This can be easily\nverified also by adopting the King (1962) analytical expression \u03a3 = \u03a3o /(1 + (R/Rc )2 ) to\ndescribe the inner surface density profile of a King model: fitting this analytical profile with\na power-law between \u223c 0.05rc and rc /3 yields \u03bd \u223c \u22120.05. Smaller values of \u03bd might be\nobtained by restricting the radial range to regions closer to the center, but such an approach\nmay be complicated by fluctuations in the surface brightness profile of a cluster's innermost\nregions and, for actual data, possibly by the lack of adequate resolution.\nDespite the different procedure adopted to measure the inner slope, our results are\nconsistent within 1-sigma with the analysis of artificial images of King models discussed in\nNoyola & Gebhardt (2006; see e.g. their results for N = 50000 in the 'subtracted' and '10%\nsubtracted' panels of their Fig.4).\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nThe six panels of Fig. 1 show the time evolution of the index \u03bd for the simulations with\n32K particles. A smooth curve fit to the data has been added to highlight the evolutionary\ntrend. The grey shaded area shows the range of values of \u03bd expected for systems hosting\nIMBHs based on past studies (Baumgardt et al. 2005, Miocchi 2007). Our IMBH run falls\nwithin this range presenting a shallow inner cusp with slope \u03bd \u223c \u22120.25, approximately\nconstant during the entire cluster evolution.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThe results of the simulation 32K (a system with no IMBH and no primordial binaries),\non the other hand, show an evolution of \u03bd characterized by three phases. For t/trh (0) <\n\u223c 5,\nthe system is in the pre-core-collapse phase; as anticipated by our preliminary estimates of\n\u03bd for a system described by a King model in \u00a72, during this phase the value of \u03bd undergoes\nsignificant fluctuations and, most of the time, falls in the range of values expected for systems\nhosting an IMBH (either directly or within 1-sigma).\nThe subsequent phase, 5 <\n\u223c 7, is the core collapse phase and is characterized\n\u223c t/trh (0) <\nby a transition to steeper slopes typical of the post-core-collapse phase. During a significant\nportion of this phase the system is characterized by a central shallow cusp with values of \u03bd in\n1\nthe range expected for systems with an IMBH. Finally for t/trh (0) >\n\u223c 7 the system is in the\npost-core-collapse phase and the slope of the inner cusp oscillates in the range \u223c \u22120.4\u2212\u22120.7;\nthese values are steeper than those predicted for clusters hosting an IMBH but even during\nthis phase, as a consequence of fluctuations and measurement errors, \u03bd may occasionally fall\nin the range of values expected for globular clusters hosting an IMBH.\nFor systems with primordial binaries, the middle and lower panels of Fig. 1 show that,\nfor a fraction of primordial binaries fbin >\n\u223c 0.03, the typical values of \u03bd overlap with the range\nof values of a system with an IMBH also for t/trh (0) >\n\u223c 7 when the core is supported by the\nprimordial binaries' burning. This makes it impossible to distinguish whether the central\nshallow cusp is a consequence of the presence of an IMBH or of the presence of primordial\nbinaries in the cluster core. We point out that the small fbin adopted here is consistent\nwith that determined observationally for a number of Galactic clusters (see e.g. Davis et al.\n2008).\nIn Figure 2 we show the results of our simulations with 64K particles. Simulation\n64K confirms the results of the lower resolution run (32K), although the larger number of\nparticles leads to a smaller average error on the estimate of \u03bd. In order to further illustrate\nthe reduction in the error on \u03bd for an increasing number of particles, we also show in Figure\n2 a panel with the time evolution of \u03bd obtained by combining two consecutive snapshots of\nthe simulation 64K. The three phases in the evolution of \u03bd described above are evident in\nboth panels. Other than the smaller error on \u03bd for larger N, our simulations do not show\nany dependence of the evolution of \u03bd on N: for the 32K run the average \u03bd is 0.08 with a 1\u03c3\nspread equal to 0.17 for t/trh (0) < 5 while the average \u03bd is 0.52 with a 1\u03c3 spread equal to\n0.19 in the post-core-collapse phase (7 < t/trh (0) < 16). For the 64K run the average \u03bd (1\u03c3\nspread) is 0.11 (0.13) for t/trh (0) < 5, and 0.55 (0.13) for 7 < t/trh (0) < 16.\n1\n\nNote that the values of t/trh (0) that separates these three phases might differ for systems starting with\na different initial concentration.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nFor simulation 64K, the difference between the measured value of \u03bd and \u03bd = \u22120.3 (the\nlower limit of the range associated with the presence of an IMBH) is, in the post-core-collapse\nphase, smaller than 1\u03c3 20% of the time. The smaller error on \u03bd when consecutive snapshots\nare combined leads to a reduced fraction of post-core-collapse snapshots (10% of the time in\nthis case) during which \u03bd is within 1\u03c3 from the black hole range.\nSimulation 64KW05 shows a similar time evolution of \u03bd and the only difference is the\ndelay in the onset of the core collapse phase, because of the lower initial concentration.\nSimulation 64K5bin also confirms the results of the analogous lower resolution run\n(32K5bin).\nFinally, the results of the simulation with a Salpeter initial mass function show that\nthe amount of dark remnants in a cluster plays a key role in driving the cluster evolution\nand in determining the shape of its inner surface brightness profile. In particular our results\nconfirm that the presence of dark remnants can significantly delay the onset of core collapse\n(see e.g. Merritt et al. 2004, Mackey et al. 2008, Trenti et al. 2010) and, in doing so, they\nextend the pre-core-collapse phase characterized by small values of \u03bd consistent with those\nof systems hosting an IMBH. Dark remnants also play an important role in the post-corecollapse phase: specifically, by segregating in the cluster inner regions and heating the visible\ncluster population, dark remnants tend to produce a shallower core-collapse cusp than that\nobserved in systems with no primordial binaries, no IMBH and a smaller population of dark\nremnants.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur simulations show that during their evolution, clusters without an IMBH are often\ncharacterized by central shallow cusps in the surface brightness profile with a slope falling\nin the range of values expected for systems with an IMBH.\nFor clusters in the post-core-collapse phase with neither primordial binaries nor a significant fraction of dark remnants, the inner cusp is steeper (\u22120.7 <\n\u223c \u2212 0.4) than that\n\u223c\u03bd<\nof systems with an IMBH. If we know that a cluster is in the post-core-collapse phase and\nhas neither primordial binaries nor a significant fraction of dark remnants, then a shallow\ncusp in the range \u22120.3 <\n\u223c\u03bd<\n\u223c \u2212 0.05 could be indicative of an IMBH.\n\nHowever, a small fraction of primordial binaries (fbin >\n\u223c 0.03) and/or the amount of\ndark remnants produced assuming a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (with a 100 per\ncent retention of dark remnants) act as a central heating mechanism sufficient to produce\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\na shallow inner cusp with the same range of slope values expected for systems hosting an\nIMBH.\nFigure 3 summarizes the results of a representative subset of our simulations showing\nthe different dynamical phases and cluster properties that can be associated with the presence\nof a shallow cusp. This figure nicely illustrates the problem faced by any attempt to use a\nshallow cusp as an indicator of the presence of an IMBH.\nAs an example, we plotted in Fig. 3 the Galactic clusters NGC 5694 and NGC 6388\nfor which Noyola & Gebhardt (2006) estimated, respectively, \u03bd = \u22120.19 \u00b1 0.11 and \u03bd =\n\u22120.13 \u00b1 0.07 . Following Hurley (2007), we estimated the dynamical ages of NGC 5694 and\nNGC 6388 assuming trh (0) \u223c 2trh (now), where trh (now) is the current value of the half-mass\nrelaxation time (from the most recent version of the Harris(1996) catalogue)2 . The values\nfor the slope of the inner cusp of these two clusters fall within the range of values expected\nfor systems hosting an IMBH and indeed Umbreit et al. (2009) reproduced the NGC5694\nsurface brightness profile with a Monte Carlo simulation of a system hosting an IMBH with\na mass MBH = 0.003 Mcluster . As for NGC 6388, Lanzoni et al. (2007) fit the observed\nsurface brightness profile with a multimass King model with an IMBH and suggested the\npresence of an IMBH with MBH \u223c 5.7 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 (\u223c 0.0022 Mcluster ).\nIn Fig. 3 we show, however, that the slopes of the observed surface brightness profile of\nthese clusters are also consistent with the results of simulations of systems without an IMBH\nunder a variety of different initial conditions. In particular with the estimated dynamical age,\nthese clusters might be either in the pre-core-collapse phase or currently entering the corecollapse phase. It is interesting to note that in a recent study based on radio observations of\nNGC 6388, Cseh et al. (2010) obtained an upper limit MBH < 735 \u00b1 244M\u2299 , significantly\nsmaller than the estimate of MBH based on the surface density profile.\nOur analysis clearly shows that shallow cusps in the surface brightness profile appear\nnaturally during the dynamic evolution of star clusters without an IMBH. Therefore their\npresence in an observed profile cannot be used as a strong argument in favor of the presence\nof a central IMBH.\nWe acknowledge support from grants NASA-NNX08AH29G, NASA-NNX08AH15G,\nHST-AR-11284, TG-AST090094 and TG-AST090045.\n2\n\nWe emphasize that this dynamical age is very uncertain. Specific models for individual clusters (see e.g.\nGiersz & Heggie 2009) would be necessary for a higher accuracy determination of the cluster dynamical age.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nREFERENCES\nAarseth S., 2003, Gravitational N-body Simulations.
