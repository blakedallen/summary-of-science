At present, experimental tests of this DM component are almost exclusively limited to gravitational\ninteractions, and few constraints exist on the character of DM. Axions, dark photons, sterile neutrinos and even more exotic theoretical constructs are all plausible DM\ncandidates [2], though models containing a new neutral and stable weakly-interacting\nmassive particle (WIMP) of mass \u223c 100 GeV are by far the most studied. WIMPs are\na favorable candidate because their mass and couplings to the SM can naturally give\na cosmological relic density in agreement with the experimentally measured value [3].\nAdditionally, WIMPs point to new physics at the weak scale (\u223c 100 GeV \u2212 1 TeV), a\nscale that has been the focus of much theoretical work to explain the stability of the\nHiggs potential and the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking.\nIn the past several decades, supersymmetry (SUSY) has been the most widelystudied, and arguably the best-motivated, theoretical framework for physics beyond\nthe SM [4\u201310]. In the most attractive SUSY models, an extra matter parity (\"Rparity\") symmetry is used to simultaneously explain the stability of the proton and of\nthe Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). In viable SUSY models the LSP is often\nthe lightest neutralino (\u03c7\u030301 ), which is one of the most widely studied examples of WIMP\nDM. Generic predictions of SUSY are difficult to obtain, since the minimal consistent\nSUSY extension of the SM, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)\nintroduces more than 100 free parameters. A typical strategy for overcoming this difficulty is to highly constrain this set of parameters by employing aesthetic assumptions\nabout the physical origin of SUSY at a very high energy (i.e., mSUGRA [11, 12]).\nIn contrast, here we study a broader and more comprehensive subset of the MSSM,\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fthe phenomenological-MSSM (pMSSM) [13]. The pMSSM is derived from the MSSM\nusing experimental data to eliminate parameters that are free in principle, but highly\nconstrained by observations (e.g., sources of flavor violation in the new physics flavor\nsector). Thus, the pMSSM provides a compromise between the need to remain flexible\nand somewhat agnostic in assumptions about yet-undiscovered physics and the need\nto categorize the range of predictions made by well-motivated models. The LSPs of\nthe pMSSM are viable candidates to comprise some or all of DM, and they may be\nprobed through a variety of experimental approaches.\nThe possibility of DM-SM interactions having weak-force strength allows an exciting opportunity to detect and characterize the nature of DM via a combination of\nexperimental efforts. For example, weak-strength interactions might lend themselves\nto study at the LHC, where DM particles could be produced and studied indirectly\nthrough missing energy signatures. Additionally, the DM halo permeating our galaxy\ncould be detected directly through scattering interactions between DM particles and\nnuclei in detectors on Earth. Finally, indirect detection of DM is possible through\nthe astrophysical observation of anomalous energetic SM particles resulting from DM\nparticle annihilation (or decay).\nOne of the most sensitive instruments for the indirect detection of DM is the\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi ).\nGamma rays from the final state of DM annihilation (or decay) would be produced\npreferentially in regions of high DM density and may be detectable by the LAT. Dwarf\nspheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) of the Milky Way are promising targets for the\ndetection of such a signal. These dSphs are DM-dominated and lack active astrophysical production of \u03b3-rays [14, 15], a troublesome background in many other searches\nfor DM annihilation. The LAT Collaboration recently presented results constraining\nthe annihilation cross section for a small set of prototypical DM models from a joint\nlikelihood analysis of 10 dwarf spheroidal galaxies [16]. In the present paper, we extend\nthis analysis to an investigation of \u223c 71k pMSSM models previously discussed in the\nliterature [13].\nWe begin by briefly discussing the techniques employed to generate \u223c 71k pMSSM\nmodels and the various constraints imposed in their selection. We next describe the\ncombined likelihood procedure for setting upper limits on the annihilation cross section\nfor each pMSSM DM model using LAT observations of ten Milky Way dSphs. We\ncompare the LAT cross section limits to the actual cross section for each pMSSM\nmodel and study the SUSY model dependence of these results in detail. The main\nfindings are: (i ) that the LAT is currently most sensitive to light LSPs (m\u03c7\u030301 < 50 GeV)\nannihilating primarily to \u03c4 -pairs, (ii ) that annihilations to \u03c4 -pairs are actually harder\nto limit than annihilations to the other channels for relatively heavy (m\u03c7\u030301 > 50 GeV)\nLSPs, and (iii ) that, surprisingly, a significant fraction of the models that are near LAT\nsensitivity have LSPs that would form a sub-dominant component of the total DM halo.\nAdditionally, we discuss the relationship between LSP eigenstate composition and the\nLAT sensitivity. Finally, we compare expectations for near-future LAT dSph searches\nand direct detection experiments.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f2\n\nGeneration of the pMSSM Model Set\n\nThe sensitivity of the LAT detector can be explored over a broad region of supersymmetric parameter space. We investigate the \u03b3-ray production from \u223c 71k points in\nthe 19-dimensional pMSSM parameter space generated in previous work [13]. These\npoints pass all of the constraints discussed in this section and are referred to as pMSSM\nmodels.\nThe 19-dimensional parameter space of the pMSSM results from imposing the following minimal set of assumptions on the general R-Parity conserving MSSM [17]: (i)\nthe soft parameters are taken to be real, allowing no new CP-violating sources beyond\nthose in the CKM matrix; (ii) Minimal Flavor Violation [18] is taken to be valid at\nthe TeV scale; (iii) the first two generations of sfermions having the same quantum\nnumbers are taken to be degenerate and to have negligible Yukawa couplings; and (iv)\nthe LSP is taken to be the lightest neutralino and is assumed to be a stable thermal\nWIMP. No assumptions about the physics at high energy scales or SUSY-breaking\nmechanisms are employed. The first three conditions are applied to avoid issues associated with constraints from the flavor sector. These assumptions reduce the SUSY\nparameter space to 19 free soft-breaking parameters that are given by the three gaugino masses, M1,2,3 , ten sfermion masses mQ\u03031 ,Q\u03033 ,\u01691 ,d \u03031 ,\u01693 ,d \u03033 ,L\u03031 ,L\u03033 ,\u1ebd1 ,\u1ebd3 , the three A-terms\nassociated with the third generation (Ab,t,\u03c4 ), and the usual Higgs sector parameters \u03bc,\nMA and tan \u03b2.\nThe set of models discussed in this paper was selected by numerical scans over\nthe 19-dimensional parameter space of the pMSSM. This selection required a choice of\nparameter range intervals and scan priors. Issues involved in this selection have been\ndescribed in detail previously [13, 19, 20]. Here, we simply note that two scans were\nperformed: one employed a flat prior beginning with 107 points, and a second used a\nlogarithmic prior employing 2 \u00d7 106 points. The relevant differences between these two\nscans are that (i) all SUSY mass parameters were restricted to be \u2264 1 TeV for the\nflat-prior case, while for the log-prior case this restriction was raised to \u2264 3 TeV, and\n(ii) the choice of the logarithmic prior generally leads to more compressed sparticle\nspectra than does the flat-prior case. Note that the restriction on the upper limit for\nthe mass parameters in both scans is chosen to ensure relatively large production cross\nsections at the LHC. In the present work, we focus primarily on results for pMSSM\nmodels in the flat-prior set.\nAfter scanning the 19-dimensional parameter space, we subjected the resulting\npoints to a set of theoretical and experimental constraints to select models that are valid\nfor study. We briefly review these restrictions here.1 (i) Our theoretical constraints\nrequired that spectra must be tachyon free, color and charge breaking minima must be\navoided, and a bounded Higgs potential must exist (leading to radiative electroweak\nsymmetry breaking). (ii) We employed a number of constraints from the flavor sector\nand precision electroweak data arising from the measurements of (g \u2212 2)\u03bc , b \u2192 s\u03b3,\nB \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, BS \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , meson\u2013anti-meson mixing, the invisible width of the Z and \u2206\u03c1.\n(iii) Restrictions resulting from numerous direct searches at LEP for both the SUSY\n1\n\nFor full details, see ref.

Some\nof these searches needed to be re-evaluated in detail to remove SUSY model-dependent\nassumptions [13]. (iv) Null results from the set of Tevatron SUSY sparticle and Higgs\nsearches were imposed. The most restrictive Tevatron data came from searches for\nstable charged particles [21] and from searches for an excess of multijet events with\nmissing transverse energy [22]. We note that in the latter case, the search strategies\nwere designed for kinematics expected in mSUGRA-inspired models, which required\nspecialized simulations to apply these results in the context of the pMSSM [13]. While\nthese bounds have been superseded by LHC analyses, we note that collider searches\nhave been found to be largely uncorrelated with the most important DM observables\n(relic density, annihilation and scattering cross-sections) [23], and we expect the results\npresented here to accurately represent the prospects for indirect detection in the context\nof the pMSSM. (v) Finally, we have required that the LSP contribution to the dark\nmatter relic density not exceed the upper bound determined by WMAP [3] and that\nthe LSP scattering cross sections obey concurrent constraints from direct detection\nexperiments.\nAfter imposing theoretical and experimental constraints, \u223c 68.4k models from\nthe flat-prior sample and \u223c 2.9k models from the log-prior sample remain for study.\nNote that the LSPs of the pMSSM models are not required to saturate the measured\nrelic density. Thus, many models allow for multicomponent DM, a prosaic example\nbeing composed in part by a pMSSM neutralino and in part by an axion that solves\nthe strong CP problem. The distributions of LSP relic densities found in our flat- and\nlog-prior model sets are shown in Figure 1. We find that a small subset of pMSSM\nmodels saturate the WMAP bound (with \u03a9LSP h2 > 0.1).\nGamma-ray energy spectra are calculated for all \u223c 71k pMSSM models using\nthe computational package DarkSUSY 5.0.5 [24]. DarkSUSY calculates the total \u03b3-\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fray yield from annihilation, as well as the rates into each of 27 final state channels.\nWe omit contributions from the loop-suppressed monochromatic channels \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3Z 0\nwhich, although distinctive, are typically tiny in our model set. These \u03b3-ray spectra\nare tested for consistency with the LAT \u03b3-ray data.\n\n3\n\nLAT \u03b3-ray Limits on the pMSSM\n\nThe Milky Way dSphs are a promising set of sources for the indirect detection of\nDM via \u03b3 rays. Stellar velocity data from these galaxies suggest that they are very\nrich in DM, while observations at other wavelengths show no signs of astrophysical\nsignals [14, 15]. The integrated signal flux at the LAT, \u03c6s ( ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), from pair\nannihilation in a DM distribution with density given by \u03c1(~r) is\nZ Emax\nZ nZ\no\ndN \u03b3,tot\n2\n0 1 h\u03c3viT\ndE\u03b3 ,\n(3.1)\n\u03c6s =\n\u03c1 (~r)dl d\u03a9 *\n4\u03c0 2m2\u03c7\u03030 Emin dE\u03b3\nl.o.s\n1\n{z\n}\n| \u2206\u03a9\nJ\n\nThe preceding J-factor represents the line-of-sight integral through \u03c12 integrated over\na solid angle \u2206\u03a9, while the second factor is strictly dependent on the particle physics\nproperties of the DM model and is integrated over the experimental energy threshold\n(discussed in more detail in section 4.2). Using Eq. (3.1), it is possible to combine the\nintegrated J-factor for a dark matter distribution (calculated empirically for the dSph)\nwith the particle physics characteristics of a DM model (from the pMSSM model set)\nto describe the predicted \u03b3-ray annihilation signal.\nWe follow the procedure of Ackermann et al. (2011; henceforth A11) to constrain\nthe \u03b3-ray signal from ten dSphs with a joint likelihood analysis of the LAT data. Our\ndata sample and event selection are identical to those described in A11, taking photons\nin the energy range from 200 MeV < E < 100 GeV. In concordance with A11, we use\nLAT ScienceTools2 version v9r20p0 and the P6 V3 DIFFUSE IRFs.3 J-factors and\nassociated uncertainties for the ten dSphs are taken from Table 1 of A11, where they\nwere calculated using line-of-sight stellar velocities and the Jeans equation [16].\nOur procedure for constraining h\u03c3vi differs from that of A11 in that we model the\n\u03b3-ray emission from the dSphs with spectra generated from the \u223c 71k pMSSM models\nrather than prototypical annihilation channels (i.e., bb\u0304, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 etc.). We calculate a joint\nlikelihood for each pMSSM model by tying the pMSSM model parameters across the\nregions of interest (ROIs) surrounding the ten dSphs. Following A11, we incorporated\nuncertainties in the J-factors of the dSphs as nuisance parameters in our likelihood\nmaximization. Thus, our joint likelihood function is\nY\nL(D | pm , {pk }) =\nLLAT\n(Dk | pm , pk )\nk\nk\n\n1\n2\n2\n\u221a\n\u00d7\ne\u2212(log10 (Jk )\u2212log10 (Jk )) /2\u03c3k .\nln(10)Jk 2\u03c0\u03c3k\n2\n3\n\nhttp://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software\nhttp://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/overview.html\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fdenotes the standard LAT binned Poisson likelihood for\nHere, k indexes the ROIs, LLAT\nk\nthe analysis of a single ROI,4 Dk represents the binned \u03b3-ray data, {pm } represents the\nset of ROI-independent pMSSM model parameters, and {pk } are the ROI-dependent\nmodel parameters. Included in {pk } are both the flux normalizations of background \u03b3ray sources (diffuse and point-like) and the associated dSph J-factors and uncertainties.\nWe find no significant \u03b3-ray signal from any of the dSphs when analyzed individually\nor jointly for any of the pMSSM models.\nFor each of the \u223c 71k pMSSM models, we calculate the maximum annihilation\ncross section, h\u03c3viUL , consistent with the null detection in the composite LAT data.\nTo deal with nuisance parameters present in the joint likelihood, we constructed a\nprofile likelihood Lp (D | h\u03c3vi) by scanning in h\u03c3vi and maximizing L(D | pm , {pi })\nwith respect to the other free parameters [25]. For each model, we proceeded to obtain\na 95% one-sided confidence interval on the value of h\u03c3vi by first maximizing log(Lp )\nwith respect to h\u03c3vi and then evaluating log(Lp ) at increasing values of h\u03c3vi until\n\u2206 ln Lp = \u22122.71/2 [25]. This one-sided 95% confidence limit on h\u03c3vi serves as our\nvalue of h\u03c3viUL , which is compared to the true value annihilation cross section for each\npMSSM model.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\nIn this section, we investigate the ability to constrain the predicted flux spectra of\npMSSM models using LAT \u03b3-ray flux measurements from ten dSphs. We then discuss\nthe SUSY model dependence of our results and improvements that can be made in\nsearches such as this one to enhance sensitivity to annihilations from certain classes of\nmodels.\n4.1\n\nModel Constraint Distance\n\nWe present limits placed on each of the \u223c 71k pMSSM model spectra from a joint\nlikelihood fit of ten Milky Way dSphs as described in Section 3. For each model, we\ncompute the effective distance from constraint as the ratio\nD \u2261 h\u03c3viUL /h\u03c3viT ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhich compares the maximum annihilation cross section allowed by the data for a given\nspectral shape, h\u03c3viUL , to the actual cross section predicted for the pMSSM model\ngiving rise to this spectral shape, h\u03c3viT . Here, the symbol h\u03c3viT represents the current\nannihilation cross section obtained assuming that the LSP follows a standard thermal\ncosmological evolution.5 It is important to note that, because we have employed the\nWMAP measurement of the DM relic density only as an upper bound when selecting\npMSSM models, the appropriate normalization of the \u03b3-ray spectra for each model\n4\n\nhttp://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone Likelihood/\nOne should not confuse the \"T \" in h\u03c3viT , here denoting thermal cosmology, for the thermal\naverage over the current halo Boltzmann distribution, which is here denoted by the angle brackets\nh. . .i.\n5\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\finvolves a rescaling of the empirical estimate for the local DM energy density by the\nfactor\n\u03a9\u03c7\n, as, h\u03c3viT \u2261 h\u03c3viR2 ,\n(4.2)\nR=\n\u03a9WMAP\nwhere \u03a9WMAP h2 = 0.1143 [3]. The factors of R in h\u03c3viT serve to obtain the correct thermal number density of WIMPs n = \u03c1\u03c7\u030301 /m\u03c7\u030301 = (\u03c10 R)/m\u03c7\u030301 (where \u03c1\u03c7\u030301 and\n\u03c10 \u2248 0.3 GeV cm\u22123 are the energy density of the LSP and the empirically determined\n[26] total local DM energy density, respectively). LSPs in models with R \u001c 1 are interpreted as comprising one component of a multicomponent DM halo. For definiteness,\nwe identify pMSSM models with LSPs that nearly saturate the WMAP relic density,\n\u03a9LSP h2 > 0.10 (R > 0.875), and distinguish this subset of models in the figures that\nfollow. Deviations from the scaling in Eq. (4.2) would be appropriate for models where\nnon-standard cosmology or other non-standard mechanisms [27\u201333] sever the relationship between the relic density and the present-day annihilation cross section obtained\nfrom thermal Boltzmann cosmological evolution. We assume that standard thermal\nevolution occurs and calculate results relative to this scenario.\nThe ratio D (Eq. (4.1)) is calculated for each pMSSM model and is displayed\nin Figure 2. Models with D < 1 would be excluded at > 95% confidence, while\nmodels with D > 1 evade this limit by a factor of D. None of the pMSSM models\nare excluded at 95% confidence by this analysis; however, values of D reach \u223c 1.5 for\n< 40 GeV, relic densities nearly saturating the\nmany of the models with LSP masses \u223c\nWMAP measurement (R \u2248 1) and annihilating predominantly to \u03c4 -pairs (as is further\ndiscussed in section 4.2).\nSince the LAT is presently very close to constraining part of the pMSSM parameter space, it is useful to estimate how constraints may improve over a 10 year mission\nlifetime. In the low-energy, background dominated regime, the LAT point source sensitivity increases as roughly the square-root of the integration time. However, in the\nhigh-energy, limited background regime (where many pMSSM models contribute), the\nLAT sensitivity increases \u221a\nmore linearly with integration time. Thus, 10 years of data\ncould provide a factor of 5 to 5 increase in sensitivity. Additionally, optical surveys\nsuch as Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey could provide a factor of 3 increase\nin \u221a\nthe number of Milky Way dSphs corresponding to an increased constraining power\nof 3 to 3 [34]. Ongoing improvements in LAT event reconstruction, a better understanding of background contamination, and an increased energy range are all expected\nto provide additional increases in the LAT sensitivity. Thus, we find it plausible that\nthe LAT constraints could improve by a factor of 10 compared to current constraints,\nand we choose to examine pMSSM models with D < 10 in detail. The interest in\nmodels with D < 10 is additionally motivated by predictions that DM substructure\nmay increase the J-factors of dSphs by a factor of 2 to 10 [35, 36]. Such a boost would\ntranslate into a tightening of the current upper limits on h\u03c3vi by a comparable factor.\nIn Figure 2 we observe, as expected, that the relic density of a given pMSSM\nmodel is important in determining the \u03b3-ray signal strength. Despite this, we see that\nthat the range of predictions in either subset of models is quite large, spanning many\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f10 000.\n\n10 000.\n\n1000.\n\n\u00f0 Models\n\n\u00f0 Models\n\n1000.\n\n100.\n\n100.\n\n10.\n\n10.\n\n1.\n\n1.\n\n0.1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0.1\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nLog10@<\u03a3\u03a5>T H10-26 cm3s-1LD\n\nLog10@DD\n\nFigure 2.

We similarly histogram h\u03c3viT and\nnote that the D distribution is largely driven by the h\u03c3viT distribution.\n\norders of magnitude. We note the surprising fact that, among models with D < 10,\nnearly 40% do not saturate the WMAP bound.\nWhen we compare our set of log-prior models to the flat-prior set, we find that\nthe results are generally consistent with a somewhat larger tail towards large values of\nD. As noted in the next section, the shape of the D distribution is largely determined\nby the shape of the h\u03c3viT distribution, and one can verify that the difference in D\ndistributions between flat- and log-prior cases is echoed in their h\u03c3viT distributions.\nModels with such large D values are seen to be special cases, involving a finely tuned\nrelationship between the DM mass and the mass of one or more of the SUSY Higgs\nstates (such that m\u03c7\u030301 \u223c mh /2, so-called\"Higgs funnel\" models), that annihilate so\nefficiently in the early universe as to have minuscule relic density.\n\n4.2\n\nSUSY Model Dependence\n\nIn discussing the SUSY model dependence of these results, we first note (c.f., Figure\n3) that most of the span in D arises from the wide ranging values of the quantity\nh\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030 . For a given value of h\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030 we observe that there is only about an\n1\n1\norder of magnitude span in D. To understand this finding we note that the total signal\n\u03b3-ray flux, \u03c6s , as calculated in Eq. (3.1) (and repeated here for clarity), is\nZ\n\u03c6s =\n\u2206\u03a9\n\n|\n\nZ Emax\no\ndN \u03b3,tot\n0 1 h\u03c3viT\ndE\u03b3 ,\n\u03c1 (~r)dl d\u03a9 *\n4\u03c0 2m2\u03c7\u03030 Emin dE\u03b3\nl.o.s\n1\n{z\n}\n\nnZ\n\n2\n\nJ\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fFigure 3. Flat-prior pMSSM models represented in the D vs. h\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030 plane. Grey\n1\npoints represent generic models in this set while the subset of models with R \u2248 1 are highlighted in blue. One observes that the wide range of D values corresponds directly to the\nwide range h\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030 values in our model set, and that at a given value of h\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030\n1\n1\nthere is about an order of magnitude span in D values. It can also be noted that only \u223c 60%\nof models with D < 10 have R \u2248 1.\n\nWe focus now on the particle physics-dependent piece, which is itself a product of the\nfactor h\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030 and of the integral over the the total \u03b3-ray continuum yield curve:6\n1\n\n\u001b\n\u001a \u03b3,sec\ndN \u03b3,tot X\ndNi\u03b3,F SR dNi\u03b3,V IB\ndNi\n=\nBi\n+\n+\n.\ndE\u03b3\ndE\u03b3\ndE\u03b3\ndE\u03b3\ni\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe D value expected from a given model is thus predominantly determined by the\ntotal thermally-averaged annihilation cross section, h\u03c3viT , the relic density (via R)\nand the LSP mass (via h\u03c3viT /2m2\u03c7\u03030 ), and to a much lesser extent by the shape of the\n1\nSUSY signal spectrum.\nWe next discuss the SUSY model dependence of the spectral shape of the annihilation signal. It is useful to remove the large prefactor, h\u03c3viT /m2\u03c7\u03030 , focusing on the\n1\nquantity:\nZ Emax\ndN \u03b3,tot\n2\ndE\u03b3 ,\n(4.5)\n\u03c6s \u00d7 (m\u03c7\u03030 /h\u03c3viT ) \u221d\n1\ndE\u03b3\nEmin\nwhere we integrate the total continuum yield curve over the experimental energy range\nfrom Emin = 200 MeV to Emax = 100 GeV. In translating to \u03c6s \u00d7(m2\u03c7\u03030 /h\u03c3viT ), we have\n1\nremoved the explicit dependence on the total annihilation rate h\u03c3viT and most of the\n6\n\nHere the sum is over annihilation final-state channels with terms describing hadronization yield\n(\"secondary\" \u03b3 rays), final-state radiation (FSR) and virtual internal bremsstrahlung (VIB). As previously noted, a possible monochromatic \u03b3 contribution is negligible here. We use the language of [37]\nin discriminating FSR and VIB, although it has been pointed out that such a distinction is somewhat\nartificial (or not even gauge invariant) [38].\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fdependence on the LSP mass. What remains is a quantity that depends on the relative\nannihilation rates into SM final state channels, which is useful for comparing models\nwith similar h\u03c3viT and LSP mass. A small residual LSP mass dependence remains\nin \u03c6s \u00d7 (m2\u03c7\u03030 /h\u03c3viT ), via the relationship between the LSP mass and the limits of\n1\nintegration in Eq. (4.5).\nThe supersymmetric origin of our \u03b3-ray spectra is reflected in the distribution of\nannihilations into distinct SM final states (f ). In SUSY, due to the Majorana nature\nof the annihilating \u03c7\u030301 particles and the fact that \u03c7\u030301 s are non-relativistic in current\nDM halos, the annihilation rates for processes such as \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304 are proportional to\n(mf /m\u03c7\u030301 )2 , a fact that is often referred to as helicity suppression [39]. The ratio of\nrates into distinct channels (say f f \u0304 and f 0 f \u03040 ) is thus \u221d (mf /mf 0 )2 so that annihilation\nrates into channels with heavy final-state SM particles often dominate those with\nlighter final-state SM particles. These ratios are complicated by the fact that the\nrates \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304 are coherent sums of subprocesses with varying couplings, mixing\nangles, and exchanged particle masses. Nonetheless, in our pMSSM model set, we\nsee that the dominant annihilation final states are often in accord with the helicity\nsuppression intuition. For the vast majority of models in our set, annihilations are\npredominantly composed of a mixture of the bb\u0304, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , W + W \u2212 , Z 0 Z 0 and tt\u0304 channels\nthat are kinematically allowed (i.e., m\u03c7\u030301 > mf ). We observe a number of cases where\nthe loop-level annihilation to gluons, \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 gg, is dominant7 and a small number\nof cases where there are sizable (but still sub-dominant) contributions from the hA0 ,\nHA0 , hZ 0 , HZ 0 , W \u00b1 H \u2213 and (monochromatic) \u03b3\u03b3 or \u03b3Z 0 channels.\nThe ability of the LAT to constrain a given pMSSM model can be decomposed\ninto two planes (displayed in Figure 4). The \u03c6UL (LAT flux upper limit) vs. LSP\nmass plane demonstrates the ability of the LAT to constrain the spectral shapes of\nvarious annihilation channels, while the \u03c6s \u00d7(m2\u03c7\u03030 /h\u03c3viT ) vs. LSP mass plane describes\n1\nthe (scaled) signal flux expected from each channel. We see that subsets of models\nwith nearly pure annihilation final state channels cluster tightly in both the \u03c6UL vs.\nLSP mass and \u03c6s \u00d7 (m2\u03c7\u03030 /h\u03c3viT ) vs. LSP mass planes and, with the exception of the\n1\ndominantly Z 0 Z 0 channel models,8 extend down to their kinematic endpoints.9\n7\n\nLoop-level annihilation to glouns can occur when the LSP co-annihilates with light flavored\n \u0303 \u1ebd, \u03bd\u0303, etc.) in the early Universe. In current DM halos, annihilation by exsfermions (e.g., \u0169, d,\nchange of the lightest sfermions is heavily helicity suppressed (\u223c m2f /m2\u03c7\u03030 ) so that the loop-level\n1\nprocess \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 gg may become the most efficient annihilation channel today.\n8\nWhile the subset of models with (h\u03c3viZZ /h\u03c3vi) > 0.42 do not extend down to m\u03c7\u030301 \u2248 mZ , the\nsubset of models with (h\u03c3viZZ /h\u03c3vi) > 0.20 do extend to this kinematic endpoint. The highest purity\nfor \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z 0 Z 0 annihilations in our model set is (h\u03c3viZZ /h\u03c3vi) \u2248 0.45, such models also annihilate\nto \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 W + W \u2212 with (h\u03c3viW W /h\u03c3vi) \u2248 0.55.\n9\nThe set of O(10) orange points near the top threshold, m\u03c7\u030301 \u2248 mt , are models that annihilate\ndominantly through the \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 tt\u0304 channel. They have very bino-like LSPs (supressing many other\nchannels) and currently annihilate dominantly through stop exchange. These models satisfy the\nWMAP relic abundance constraint either by co-annihilation with a light stop or via the exchange of\nvery light sfermions (i.e., channels that were more efficient at freeze-out). Since they are forced to\nannihilate dominantly to tt\u0304 with m\u03c7\u030301 \u2248 mt , they are phase-space suppressed, h\u03c3vitt\u0304 \u221d (1\u2212m2t /m2\u03c7 )1/2 ,\nand their fluxes are much lower than typical models that annihilate through this channel.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 4.

The full flat-prior model set is displayed as grey points and models\nwhose annihilations occur predominantly through a given final state channel are overlaid in\nother colors.

Purities are chosen to obtain model subsets of similar size.\n\nThe left panel of Figure 4 confirms that the LAT search places tighter constraints\n(\u03c6UL ) on harder \u03b3-ray spectra, which is to be expected as astrophysical backgrounds\nfall rapidly with energy. In particular, we see that LAT constraints on spectra from\nnearly pure \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 annihilations are tighter, by about an order of magnitude,\nthan those placed on nearly pure \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304 annihilations. One expects the shapes\nand the relationship between these two \"curves\" to change significantly as LAT data\ntaking continues. The LAT sensitivity to hard spectra, which contribute a significant\n> 10 GeV), is expected to increase\nnumber of photons in the background-free regime (\u223c\nmore quickly than the sensitivity to softer spectra, which contribute in the backgrounddominated regime. Thus, the gap between limits on \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 bb\u0304 in\nthe left panel of Figure 4 is expected to widen with increased LAT data taking.\nWe note from the right panel of Figure 4 that nearly pure annihilations to \u03c4 -pairs\nyield about an order of magnitude fewer signal photons than models with nearly pure\nannihilations to bb\u0304, at the same LSP mass and h\u03c3viT . This finding was discussed at\nlength in ref. [19], where it was noted that, although the \u03b3-ray spectra resulting from\n\u03c4 -like annihilations are harder (due to a large contribution from prompt \u03c0 0 decay), they\nare also shallower at low energies. This is demonstrated in Figure 5, where we display\nspectra (as calculated by DarkSUSY 5.0.4) for models that annihilate nearly purely\ninto the bb\u0304 and \u03c4 -pair final-state channels. The curves displayed here correspond to the\nintegrand in Eq. (4.5) and, when plotted in terms of the variable x \u2261 E\u03b3 /m\u03c7\u030301 , have\na nearly universal shape (there is significant SUSY model dependence in the signal\nspectra for E\u03b3 \u2248 m\u03c7\u030301 , due to internal bremsstrahlung [37]). Comparing the bb\u0304 and\n\u03c4 -pair cases it is clear that, at a given LSP mass and h\u03c3viT , the softer bb\u0304 spectra will\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fproduce a much larger integrated flux of signal \u03b3 rays than the \u03c4 -pair spectra. We also\nobserve that the vast majority of signal \u03b3 rays have energy E\u03b3 \u001c m\u03c7\u030301 , regardless of\nthe particular final-state channel, so that the integrated signal flux depends sensitively\non the lower limit of integration xmin \u2261 Emin /m\u03c7\u030301 . Heavier LSPs allow integration to\nlower x values and thus a wider gap between the total flux from bb\u0304 and \u03c4 -pair spectra.\nThis is reflected in the relative slope of the red and green \"lines\" in the right panel of\nFigure 4.\nThe two panels of Figure 4 describe two important factors in determining D \u2261\nh\u03c3viUL /h\u03c3viT \u2261 \u03c6UL /\u03c6s : (i) the ability to tightly constrain the flux from a given\nspectral shape (\u03c6UL ) and (ii ) the flux that can be expected from that particular spectral\nshape (\u03c6s ). These pieces of information must be combined to determine the ease with\nwhich the LAT can constrain final state channels (i.e., the magnitude of D), while\nproviding a fair comparison between models annihilating to different final states with\nsimilar LSP mass and h\u03c3viT . This is shown in the left panels of Figure 6.\nIn the left panels of Figure 6 we display points for our models in the D\u00d7h\u03c3viT /m2\u03c7\u03030\n1\nvs. LSP mass plane, with models that annihilate largely into single final state channels colored as in Figure 4. Using D \u00d7 h\u03c3viT /m2\u03c7\u03030 is equivalent to using \u03c6UL /(\u03c6s \u00d7\n1\n(m2\u03c7\u03030 /h\u03c3viT )), a ratio of the values found in either panel of Figure 4. We see that\n1\nannihilations to a given final state are organized nicely in this plane. For comparison,\nin the right panels of Figure 6 we display points for each of our flat-prior models in\nthe D vs. LSP mass plane using the same color scheme,where the colored points are\nseen to be highly mixed. Figure 6 allows us to predict whether it is easier to constrain\nannihilations to \u03c4 -pairs or to bb\u0304 (for example), at a given LSP mass, h\u03c3viT , and with\nexperimental thresholds Emin and Emax . From the left panels we observe that annihilations to \u03c4 -pairs are surprisingly more difficult to constrain than annihilations to bb\u0304 for\n> 50 GeV, while the opposite is true for lighter LSPs. This crossover\nLSP masses m\u03c7\u030301 \u223c\nat m\u03c7\u030301 \u2248 50 GeV is the point at which there is a balance between the relative ease of\nconstraining the \u03c4 -like spectral shape and the relatively low number of signal \u03b3-rays\nproduced in these annihilations, relative to the bb\u0304 case. With longer observations, we\nexpect this crossover to move toward higher energies as the limits on harder spectra\nare expected to tighten more quickly than limits on softer spectra.\nWe emphasize that the grey points in the left panels of Figure 6 are as important as\nthe colored bands. These regions represent the combination of annihilation final-state\nchannels realized in the pMSSM model set and provide an estimate for the deviation\nfrom special cases of pure annihilations. For example, we observe that there is a special\ngroup of \u223c 50 models with masses m\u03c7\u030301 \u2248 100 GeV that are constrained much more\ntightly than even the models annihilating purely to bb\u0304, i.e., the points falling below the\nred \"line\" in the top left panel of Figure 6. These are models (c.f., Figure 5) that have\na significant enhancement of the \u03b3-ray spectrum near the endpoint x = E\u03b3 /m\u03c7\u030301 \u2248 1.\nThis enhancement is due to internal bremsstrahlung [40][37], wherein an annihilation\nevent produces a \u03b3 ray directly from the hard process, i.e., \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304\u03b3, in addition\nto radiation off of the final state particles created from the process \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304. The\ncross section for the 2 \u2192 3 process is naively much smaller than that for the 2 \u2192 2\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nLog10@\n\nd\u03a6\nFlux HArb.

We display spectral shapes for pMSSM models that annihilate into bb\u0304 (red) and \u03c4 pairs (green) final states with purities as in Figure 4. Spectra have been scaled to remove the\nh\u03c3viT /m2\u03c7\u03030 prefactor and plotted in terms of the variable x = E\u03b3 /m\u03c7\u030301 in order to emphasize\n1\nthe universality of individual final state spectra.\n\nprocess as the 2 \u2192 3 case is suppressed by a fine structure constant and by threebody phase space. However, the leading terms in the 2 \u2192 2 process are helicity\nsuppressed (\u223c (mf /m\u03c7\u030301 )2 ) relative to the naive expectation, so that the 2 \u2192 3 process,\n\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304\u03b3, can be competitive with (or even dominate) the process \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304. This\nis especially true for annihilations to light final state particles (mf /m\u03c7\u030301 ) \u001c 1 through\nlight superpartner mediators (mf \u0303/m\u03c7\u030301 ) \u2248 1. Here, we find that many models in this\ngroup have SUSY mass spectra with very light sleptons, m\u1ebdR \u2248 m\u03c7\u030301 so that the wouldbe dominant annihilation channel \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 is heavily suppressed and the 2 \u2192 3\nchannel \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3 contributes greatly to the overall \u03b3-ray spectrum.\n4.3\n\nLSP Eigenstate Composition\n\nThe mapping of colored points from the left panels to the right panels of Figure 6,\ni.e., the combinations of m\u03c7\u030301 , h\u03c3vi, R, and annihilation final-state distributions, is a\ncomplicated function of many of the couplings and masses that describe an arbitrary\nSUSY model. As such, it is difficult to robustly predict D for a given model by\nusing only information about the interaction eigenstate composition of the lightest\nneutralino (our LSP DM candidate). While LSP eigenstate composition certainly has\na large impact on the resulting \u03b3-ray annihilation signal, it is difficult to disentangle\nthe entire story from this piece of information alone.\nThe impact of LSP eigenstate composition on the \u03b3-ray signal is shown in Figures 7-8. We display points similarly as in Figure 6 except that they are now highlighted\nin color according to whether their LSPs are dominantly bino, wino, higgsino or mixed\n(with purities as denoted in the caption). These figures show that, while the resulting correlations are not as tight for eigenstate composition (Figures 7-8) as those for\nannihilation final-state (Figure 6), trends still exist.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 6. We display points representing pMSSM models in the h\u03c3viUL /m2\u03c7\u03030 vs. LSP mass\n1\n(left panels) and D vs. LSP mass (right panels) planes. The full flat-prior model set is\ndisplayed as grey points and models whose annihilations occur predominantly through a\ngiven final state channel are overlaid in other colors, as denoted in the figure. In the left\npanels, one can see that removing the dependence on total annihilation rate and LSP mass\n(scaling D \u00d7 h\u03c3viT /m2\u03c7\u03030 = h\u03c3viUL /m2\u03c7\u03030 ) allows for tight localization of models with similar\n1\n1\nannihilation spectra, whereas it is comparatively difficult to predict where models fall in the\nD vs. LSP mass plane without such scaling. The upper panels display these relations for all\npMSSM models while the lower panels zoom in on those models that are closest to constraint\n(D < 10).\n\nBino-like LSPs annihilate essentially only through channels \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 f f \u0304 via tchannel exchanges of sfermion partners f \u0303. Due to helicity suppression, bino-like models\ntypically annihilate to some combination of \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , bb\u0304 and tt\u0304 (compare the red points on\nFigure 7 with the red/green/orange points in the top panels of Figure 6). The resulting\nmixture of rates into various final states depends on the pattern of sfermion masses,\nwhich are scanned over in our model generation procedure. The mapping in Figure 7\nfrom left- to right-panel is thus quite sensitive to scanned parameters, resulting in a\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fwide variety of predictions for \u03b3-ray annihilation signals from bino-like LSPs.10\nWino-like LSPs annihilate dominantly to \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 W + W \u2212 by exchange of a\n11\nchargino \u03c7\u0303+\nThese models are\n1 that is almost degenerate in mass with the LSP.\n+\nseen to correlate well with the case of annihilations purely to W W \u2212 (compare the\nblue points on Figure 7 with the blue points in the top panels of Figure 6).\nHiggsino-like LSPs couple efficiently to MSSM Higgs particles and to the Z 0 ,\nannihilating through a multitude of channels regardless of the sfermion masses. When\nm\u03c7\u030301 > mZ , these models annihilate efficiently through \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z 0 Z 0 and through\n\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 W + W \u2212 via exchange of the second neutralino, \u03c7\u030302 , and the chargino \u03c7\u0303+\n1,\nwhich are nearly degenerate in mass with the LSP. Essentially all pMSSM models with\nhiggsino-like LSPs annihilate dominantly through a mixture of the W + W \u2212 and Z 0 Z 0\nfinal-state channels. The ratio of rates into the W + W \u2212 and Z 0 Z 0 final-state channels\nis primarily controlled by phase space (and asymptotes to h\u03c3viZZ /h\u03c3viW W \u2248 0.75 for\nm\u03c7\u030301 \u001d mW ,mZ ).12 The fact that these models annihilate to a mixture of W + W \u2212 and\nZ 0 Z 0 final-state channels is reflected in the distribution of green points in Figure 8.\nIn our model set, models with mixed LSP compositions are seen to essentially\nalways have a substantial higgsino fraction and are generally described as a binohiggsino mixture with a sub-dominant wino component. Given this, the mixed LSP\ndistributions on Figure 8 are unsurprising.\nWe observe that bino and mixed LSPs are over-represented in the set of models\nwith D < 10, as compared to their occurrence in the full model set. This is to be\nexpected, since many such models are seen to achieve a large LSP relic density R \u223c 1\nwhile also maintaining a large annihilation cross section. In contrast, we find that\nnone of the models in the D < 10 have LSPs that are classified as nearly pure winos or\nhiggsinos. This is also in accord with our expectations as such purely wino or higgsino\nLSPs annihilate too efficiently in the early Universe, leaving R \u001c 1, at least for LSP\nmasses below \u223c 2 \u2212 3 TeV.\n4.4\n\nComparison to Direct Detection\n\nIt is expected that LHC searches, direct detection experiments, and indirect-detection\nexperiments will provide highly complementary information about the nature of DM.\nThe set of pMSSM models discussed in this work has already been studied in the\ncontext of LHC searches [20][43], direct detection experiments [44][23] and indirect\n10\n\nFor a large number of models in our set the calculation of h\u03c3viT is also complicated by coannihilations [41], wherein the relic density is set by an effective annihilation rate h\u03c3vief f in the early\nUniverse, which is very different from the h\u03c3vi governing annihilations in current DM halos.\n11\nFor models with very purely wino LSPs, the lightest chargino is highly degenerate in mass with\nthe LSP. Null searches for new charged stable particles performed by CDF [42] and D0 [21] have\nbeen applied in our model generation procedure [13], excluding models with stable charginos lighter\nthan <\n\u223c 206 GeV. This results in a lower limit on the blue (wino-like) points (defined as having\n|Z12 |2 > 0.99) in Figure 7.\n12\nHiggsino models with m\u03c7\u030301 < mW ,mZ typically annihilate mostly into \u03c4 -pair or bb\u0304 final states\nalthough we observe a number of models where the \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3Z 0 final states (proceeding through loops\ninvolving relatively light charginos) can become the dominant annihilation channels when the other\nrelevant new particle masses are very heavy.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 7. We display points in figures similar to those in Figure 6. Here the full flat-prior\nmodel set is displayed as grey points and models categorized according to LSP eigenstate\ncomposition are overlaid in other colors. By convention our LSPs are described in terms of\ntheir neutralino mass matrix entries as: \u03c7\u030301 = Z11 B\u0303 + Z12 W\u0303 3 + Z13 H\u030310 + Z14 H\u030320 . Bino models\nare defined as having |Z11 |2 > 0.99 and are displayed here in red. Wino models are defined\nas having |Z12 |2 > 0.99 and are displayed here in blue.\n\ndetection searches with cosmic-ray electrons and positrons [19] and neutrinos [23]. We\nnote that, essentially by construction, LHC searches are expected to rapidly exclude\n(or discover) most of the models in this set. Thus, a comparison of LAT and LHC\nresults would be relatively unenlightening, since the most constraining LHC searches\nare typically only indirectly related to the detailed nature of the LSP. Therefore, we\nfocus on a comparison between the prospects for future LAT dSph analyses and the\nlimits on spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering cross sections.\nSince scattering signals are proportional to a single factor of the local dark matter\ndensity, direct detection experiments generally have an easier time setting limits on\nLSPs with low relic density (scaling like \u223c R as opposed to \u223c R2 for indirect detection).\nIn Figure 9, we display the set of pMSSM models in the spin-independent (\"SI,\"\nleft panel) and spin-dependent (\"SD,\" right panel) scattering cross section vs. LSP\nmass planes, highlighting the models within reach of future LAT dSph analyses (i.e.,\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 8. We display points in figures similar to those in Figure 6. Here the full flat-prior\nmodel set is displayed as grey points and models categorized according to LSP eigenstate\ncomposition are overlaid in other colors. By convention our LSPs are described in terms of\ntheir neutralino mass matrix entries as: \u03c7\u030301 = Z11 B\u0303 + Z12 W\u0303 3 + Z13 H\u030310 + Z14 H\u030320 . Higgsino\nmodels are defined as having (|Z13 |2 + |Z14 |2 ) > 0.99 and are displayed here in green. Mixed\nmodels are defined as having |Z11 |2 , |Z12 |2 and (|Z13 |2 + |Z14 |2 ) all < 0.7 and are displayed\nhere in magenta.\n\nmodels with D < 10). We note that spin-independent scattering bounds have become\nsignificantly more constraining since the era when the pMSSM models were generated.\nThe current best bound has been set by the XENON100 Collaboration [45] and is\ndepicted by the black curve on the left panel of Figure 9. An uncertainty of about a\nfactor of four applies to this curve, due to uncertainty in the determination of matrix\nelements for nuclear scattering.\nWe observe that there are many models that are expected to be discovered or excluded by both direct and indirect detection experiments. This is a fortunate scenario,\npotentially allowing for relationships between LSP mass, h\u03c3vi, R, annihilation final\nstate channels and even details about heavier SUSY particles to be inferred. Additionally, we observe that there exist a number of models that will only be accessible to the\nLAT. These are models whose LSPs are dominantly bino and whose particle spectrum\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 9. Comparison of LAT dwarf search and direct detection limits. We display all\npoints in the flat-prior model set in grey and points having D < 10 in red. In the left\npanel the black curve depicts the current best SI scattering limit set by XENON100 [45].\nNear-future projected SI limits from LUX [47], SuperCDMS [48], COUPP 60kg and COUPP\n500kg [49] are displayed as, magenta-dashed, green-dashed, blue-dashed and blue-dotted\nlines, respectively. In the right panel Current SD scattering limits from the AMANDA\n[50] and IceCube-22 [51] collaborations are displayed as brown and orange lines, respectively\n(with the assumption of soft or hard channel annihilations represented by dash-dotted or solid\nlines, respectively). Near-future projected experimental limits from the COUPP [52][49] 4kg,\n60kg and 500kg searches in blue- solid, dashed and dotted lines, respectively. The projected\nIceCube/DeepCore limit estimated in [53] is displayed as a magenta-dashed line (a more\naccurate IceCube/DeepCore analysis is presented in [23]).\n\nis somewhat hierarchical, including the light bino and one or more light sleptons. Such\na scenario is essentially invisible in both direct detection experiments and at the LHC,\ndue to a lack of accessible colored production channels. Generation of a new pMSSM\nmodel set that reflects progress in direct detection limits and the early running of the\nLHC is currently underway [46].\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe investigated the ability of the LAT instrument on board the Fermi observatory\nto detect supersymmetric dark matter. LAT observations of ten Milky Way dwarf\nspheroidal satellite galaxies were combined to constrain the \u03b3-ray signal expected from\na large set of phenomenologically-viable SUSY models. The LAT analysis sets some\nof the tightest constraints on annihilation cross section yet available from indirect\ndetection experiments; however, it falls slightly short of ruling out any of the SUSY\nmodels in our set. We note that many models are quite close to being excluded\n(or discovered) by the LAT. We expect that future LAT observations and improved\ninstrument performance will put significant pressure on this region of parameter space.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fWe found that the majority of models in our set have a SUSY-dependence in\naccord with intuition developed from highly constrained scans of the MSSM. However,\nmany models have unique annihilation channels and rates that are only observed in the\nbroader context of the pMSSM. We have investigated the relative ability of the LAT to\nconstrain annihilations into various final-state channels, noting that the LAT analysis\nis most sensitive to light LSPs (m\u03c7\u030301 < 50 GeV) annihilating dominantly to \u03c4 -pairs and\nheavier LSPs annihilating dominantly to b\u0304b. Such behavior reflects a trade-off between\nthe relative ease of constraining the spectral shape of annihilations to \u03c4 -pairs with the\nrelatively low number of \u03b3 rays that are produced as a result of these annihilations.\nThe sensitivity crossover point is expected to move toward higher energies as the LAT\ncontinues to take data.\nWe have compared future expectations of the LAT dwarf search with those for\ndirect detection experiments, finding examples of models that are accessible to combinations of the two experiment classes. Although the LAT search seems to be the more\nchallenging method of discovering SUSY DM, we emphasize the unique character of\nsuch searches. Indirect searches are invaluable due to their sensitivity to DM signals\nregardless of the SM states that the DM couples to most strongly (rather than requiring a strong coupling to quarks and gluons as in direct detection experiments and, to\na large extent, colliders). Additionally, the indirect detection of DM would provide\ninformation about the cosmological DM abundance, rather than having to infer DM\nproperties from neutral detector-stable particles produced at colliders. As the LAT\nmission continues, we expect it to extend the sensitivity of indirect searches for DM\ninto this very interesting parameter space.\n\nAcknowledgments\nRCC gratefully acknowledges the support of the 2011 TASI Summer School, during\nwhich a part of this work was completed.
