Sergienko 1\nDepartment of Physics & Physical Oceanography, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, A1B 3X7, Canada\n\nAbstract\nWe consider the Landau theory of phase transitions for multiple superconducting phases in Th crystals. All\npossible phase transition sequences involving a single superconducting order parameter are found. These results\nmay be applicable to PrOs4 Sb12 .\nKey words: Skutterudites, unconventional superconductivity\n\nPerhaps the greatest descriptive power and beauty\nof the Landau theory of phase transitions is revealed\nwhen successive phase transitions are described by a\nsingle, multi-component order parameter (OP). There\nare many well-known examples of this involving structural OP's, especially among ferroelectric compounds.\nBut although multi-component OP's are the hallmark\nof most unconventional superconductors, so far there\nare no confirmed examples of multiple superconducting (SC) phases described by a single OP. PrOs4 Sb12 ,\nwhich displays two SC phases with different symmetries, may be the first.\nThe application of Landau theory to multiple SC\nphases described by a single OP was studied previously [1] for various crystal symmetries, and applied to\nUPt3 . This material displays multiple superconducting\nphase transitions due to a two-dimensional SC order\nparameter, but the degeneracy of the order parameter\nis lifted by antiferromagnetic ordering. In PrOs4 Sb12 ,\nsuperconductivity occurs at Tc1 = 1.85 K; an additional phase transition is observed at Tc2 = 1.75 K\n[2,3]. Thermal conductivity measurements revealed the\npresence of nodes and a lowering of the symmetry of the\ngap function from four-fold to two-fold at Tc2 [4], which\nis highly suggestive of a symmetry lowering phase transition involving the SC order parameter. In this article, we describe the phenomenological Landau theory\n\u2217 Email:curnoe@physics.mun.ca\n1\nThis work was supported by NSERC of Canada.\nPreprint submitted to SCES '04\n\nof multiple SC phases in Th crystals, which may be applied to PrOs4 Sb12 .\nEspecially useful when the microscopic origin of superconductivity is unknown, the phenomenological approach is based entirely on symmetry. Order parameters are classified according to representations of the\ncrystallographic point group, in terms of which the\nLandau potential is expanded. In principle, all possible\nphases, their symmetries and phase diagrams, may be\nobtained in this way, as well as the positions and types\nof nodes of the corresponding SC gap functions.\nThe point group Th has one-dimensional (1D), twodimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) representations, called A, E and T respectively, which may\nbe even (for singlet pairing) or odd (triplet pairing).\nThe phase diagram for the 1D representation A involves only one SC phase, therefore we do not consider\nit any further. For the representations E and T , we restrict our attention to phases connected by second order phase transitions, as suggested in at least one experiment [2]. Together with the restriction to a single\nOP, this sets strong constraints on allowed phase transition sequences.\nb\nThe SC gap function is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix, \u2206(k)\n=\nb\nib\n\u03c3y \u03c8(k) for singlet pairing and \u2206(k)\n= i(d(k)b\n\u03c3 )b\n\u03c3y for\nb = (b\ntriplet pairing, where \u03c3\n\u03c3x , \u03c3\nby , \u03c3\nbz ) are Pauli matrices, \u03c8(k) is an even scalar function and d(k) is an\nodd pseudovector function. The gap in the quasiparticle energy spectrum in the singlet SC state is given by\n\n14 July 2018\n\n\f\u2206(k) = |\u03c8(k)|, while in the triplet state it is \u2206\u00b1 (k) =\n[|d(k)|2 \u00b1 |d(k) \u00d7 d\u2217 (k)|]1/2 . The functions \u03c8(k) and\nd(k) are expressed in terms of the components of the\nOP \u03b7i as\nX\nX\n\u03c8(k) =\n\u03b7i \u03c8i (k),\nd(k) =\n\u03b7i di (k), (1)\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03c8i (k) and di (k) are the basis functions for the\neven and odd representations of the point group, respectively [5].\nThe transformation properties of the OP are derived\nfrom the basis functions \u03c8i and di , which may be arbitrarily chosen to span the representation. For the 2D\nrepresentation E, we choose basis functions that are\ncomplex conjugate [6]. The Landau potential expanded\nup to sixth order in the 2D OP is\n\nFig. 1.

This\ndiagram does not show phases or transitions beyond two second\norder transitions from the normal state.

As in the case\nof the 2D OP, higher order terms are needed to describe the additional phase transitions shown in Fig.\n1b). Among the various SC phases satisfying groupsubgroup relations, it is straightforward to determine\nwhich of them are connected by second order phase\ntransitions, given their symmetry groups (see Ref. [6]).\nIn all cases, the subgroup contains half the number of\nelements as the group, which means that the transition can be described by a 1D effective order parameter\nwhich has character \u22121 for half of the group elements.\nThird order terms in the effective potential are therefore prohibited, and the transitions are second order.\nProperties of the gap function, especially nodes, may\nbe determined by substituting the OP for each phase\ninto Eq. (1). For PrOs4 Sb12 , this analysis fails to explain the four-fold to two-fold symmetry lowering of\nthe gap function observed in Ref. [4]. This suggests that\nthe transition at Tc2 is due either to a second SC OP,\nor else to an OP that is of a different origin altogether.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b31 , and \u03b32 are phenomenological\nparameters. The Landau potential is invariant under\nK \u00d7 U \u00d7 G, where K is time reversal, U are U (1) gauge\ntransformations and G is the space group. Eq. (2)\ndescribes second order phase transitions between\nthe normal state and the states (1, 0) and (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ),\nas shown in Fig. 1a). The components of the state\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) have equal magnitudes and unfixed relative\nphases. The sixth order expansion is insufficient to\ndescribe the additional second order phase transition\nto the state (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ), which has neither fixed relative\nmagnitudes or phases.\nTo obtain the third phase (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ) it is necessary to\nconsider additional higher order terms in the Landau\npotential. However, such an approach is rarely followed\nin practice. Instead, an effective Landau potential of\nan effective OP is used to analyse phase transitions between the various SC phases whose symmetries satisfy\ngroup-subgroup relations. Second order phase transitions are indicated by the absence of third order terms\nof the effective OP. In our case, (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ) has symmetry D2 , which is a subgroup of the symmetry group of\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ), D2 \u00d7 K. Therefore the effective OP is 1D and\nbreaks time reversal symmetry, hence odd order terms\nin the effective Landau potential are prohibited. It follows that the transition is second order. The symmetry of (1, 0) is the group T (D2 ) (see Ref. [6]), which is\na supergroup of D2 . The transition (1, 0) \u2192 (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ) is\ndescribed by an effective 1D OP which is just \u03b72 . It is\nclear from Eq. (2) that there will be third order terms\nin the effective Landau potential of the form \u03b723 \u00b1 \u03b72\u22173 .\nTherefore the transition (1, 0) \u2192 (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ) is first order.\nFor the 3D OP, real basis functions which transform\nunder rotation as (x, y, z) are chosen for \u03c8i and di [6].\nThe free energy contains second and fourth order terms\nof the form\n\nReferences\n[1] Yu.
