INTRODUCTION\n\nThe current consensus is that star formation progresses rapidly over a wide range of environments and\nspatial scales. This view is supported by observations that a stellar population's age spread is rarely\nlarger than twice the system's crossing time (\u03c4cross =\nRcore /\u03c3v Elmegreen 2000) and that ongoing star formation appears ubiquitous within well known molecular clouds: there are few examples of clouds in a prestar forming state, or of clouds associated with stellar populations older than \u223c5 Myrs (Hartmann et al.\n2001; Ballesteros-Paredes & Hartmann 2007). Taken together, these observations suggest that star formation\nstarts soon after a molecular cloud forms, and persists\nonly a few dynamical times before the cloud is disrupted\n1 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden\nStreet, Cambridge, MA 02138\n2 Hubble Fellow\n3 Current Address: Cornell University, Department of Astronomy, 226 Space Sciences Building, Ithaca, NY 14853\n4 Visiting Astronomer at the Infrared Telescope Facility, which\nis operated by the University of Hawaii under Cooperative Agreement no.

Lacking major star formation activity, these molecular complexes\nhave only recently begun to receive significant scrutiny.\nThe first global study of the Pipe was the CO survey by Onishi et al. (1999), which identified 14 dense\nclumps that may be future sites of active star formation.\nLombardi et al. (2006) then applied the NICER technique Lombardi & Alves (2001) to 2MASS data to construct an extinction map of the Pipe. This map, which\nis shown in Figure 1, leverages the dense screen of background stars provided by the Pipe's projection against\nthe Galactic bulge, as well as its proximity (d \u223c130 pc;\nLombardi et al. 2006), to resolve physical structures as\nsmall as 0.04pc.\nStudies of the Pipe's dense cores have begun to inform our understanding of the earliest stages of the\nstar formation process. Using a wavelet filtering technique to identify individual dense cores in the Lombardi\net al. extinction map, Alves et al. (2007) noted that\nthe Pipe's dense core mass function qualitatively resembles the stellar mass functions measured in young clusters (e.g. Muench et al. 2002; Luhman 2004) and the\nfield (Covey et al. 2008; Bastian et al. 2010), but with\n\n\f2\n\nCovey et al.\n\nFig. 1.- The locations of MIPS bright sources observed in this program (red diamonds), labelled with the [CLR2010]\nsource number from Table 2. Provided for context is the NICER extinction map of the Pipe Nebula produced by\nLombardi et al. (2006) (greyscale contours); the blue box in the upper right identifies the location of B59, shown in\nmore detail in Figure 2.\n\na peak mass that is larger by a factor of three. Alves\net al. interpreted this as evidence that the stellar mass\nfunction largely reflects the physics of core formation,\nwith a global star formation efficiency of \u223c 33% between the dense core and stellar stages. Subsequent\nstudies have refined the mass function of Pipe cores,\nadopting physically motivated criteria to identify dense\ncores (Rathborne et al. 2009), and using detailed tests\nto verify the fidelity and completeness of the core mass\nfunction (Kainulainen et al. 2009). Other authors, however, have emphasized the difficulty of identifying coherent physical structures from two-dimensional columndensity maps (e.g., Smith et al. 2008) and cautioned\nagainst making strict one-to-one comparisons between\ndense core and stellar mass functions (Swift & Williams\n2008; Smith et al. 2009).\nThe physical properties of Pipe dense cores have also\nshed light on the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. A coordinated radio survey (Muench et al.\n2007; Rathborne et al. 2008; Lada et al. 2008) identified thermal pressure as the dominant source of support against collapse for the Pipe's dense cores, with\nnon-thermal support limited to sub-sonic flows. With\ntypical sizes of 0.1 parsec, and measured velocity dispersions of 0.1-0.2 km s\u22121 , these dense cores possess\nsound crossing times and minimum ages of \u223c1 million years. These core properties, and particularly\ntheir derived lifetimes, could help discriminate between\n\ntheoretical models where turbulence (Klessen et al.\n2000; Mac Low & Klessen 2004; Offner et al. 2008)\nor magnetic fields (Nakano 1984; Shu et al. 1987;\nMouschovias & Ciolek 1999; Nakamura & Li 2008) provide the dominant means of support for molecular cores.\nThis evidence, however, is somewhat circumstantial, and\nrelies on a critical assumption: that the Pipe's dense core\npopulation will one day become active sites of ongoing\nstar formation.\nThe Barnard 59 dense core (hereafter B59; originally\ndubbed the 'Sinkhole' by Barnard et al. 1927) could provide a clearer test for these theoretical models: as the\nonly site of active star formation within the Pipe, no\nextrapolations of the core's future behavior are necessary. While B59 is the Pipe's most massive core, its\nphysical properties (including the dominance of thermal\nmotions) are nonetheless representative of the broader\npopulation of dense cores within the Pipe, making it an\ninstructive case study. Since 1950, seven optically visible H\u03b1 emitting stars (or unresolved multiple systems)\nhave been associated with B59 (V359 Oph, KK Oph AB,\nLkH\u03b1 345 Oph, LkH\u03b1 346 Oph AB, KW 002, TH\u03b1 27-5,\nand LkH\u03b1 347 Oph ; Merrill & Burwell 1950; The 1964;\nStephenson & Sanduleak 1977; Kohoutek & Wehmeyer\n2003; Herbig 2005). A recent Spitzer survey of B59\nby Brooke et al. (2007) identified 16 additional candidate members with strong near-infrared (NIR) excesses,\n4 of which were detected previously in the sub-mm\n\n\fYSOs in B59\n(Reipurth et al. 1996) or by IRAS at far infrared wavelengths. These sources appear to span a range of evolutionary states, from the low-mass, relatively embedded\nClass 0/I protostar studied by Riaz et al. (2009), to more\nrevealed Class II sources. Analyses of Spitzer, ROSAT,\nand XMM observations of the Pipe Nebula confirm that\nB59 contains the vast majority of the Pipe's recently\nformed stars (Forbrich et al. 2009, 2010).\nThe physical properties of the B59 dense core make it a\ngood analog for modern computational simulations of the\ncollapse of isolated dense cores. In this respect, characterizing the timescale and efficiency of star formation in\nthe B59 dense core would provide a good opportunity to\ncompare these empirically measured quantities with the\npredictions of these simulations. Various methods have\nbeen developed to estimate the ages of pre-main sequence\nstars, with differing advantages and levels of accuracy.\nThe destruction of a star's primordial lithium abundance\nhas been used to estimate the ages of pre-main sequence\nstars with moderate success (i.e., typical uncertainties\nof \u223c10 Myrs for members of 10-30 Myr moving groups;\nMentuch et al. 2008), but this method would be difficult\nto apply to B59's YSOs: measuring lithium abundances\nrequires high resolution, high S/N optical spectra that\nwould be difficult to acquire for B59's heavily extincted\nYSOs (AV \u2265 5 Brooke et al. 2007), and recent studies\nindicate that lithium depletion may not a good age indicator for young (t<10 Myrs) T Tauri stars (Sestito et al.\n2008). A pre-main sequence star's surface gravity also\nrises as it contracts towards the main sequence, providing an additional opportunity to constrain the star's age.\nTheoretical models suggest that a precision of 0.1 dex in\nlog g can provide age estimates accurate to within 50%\n(see Figure 8, Doppmann et al. 2005), but this precision is difficult to achieve in practice. Log g values have\nbeen measured for pre-main sequence stars with an accuracy of \u223c0.2 dex (Doppmann et al. 2005; Takagi et al.\n2010, e.g., ), providing age estimates accurate to \u223c1-2\nMyrs, but as with lithium depletion studies, these measurements depend on precise measurements of line shapes\nand strengths, requiring observationally intensive high\nresolution, high signal-to-noise spectra: obtaining spectra of this quality for \u223c20 B59 YSOs would require multiple nights on an 8-meter class telescope. Surface gravity indicators have been developed for lower-resolution\nspectra, but these indicators typically depend on observations at J or shorter wavelengths, again difficult to obtain for B59 YSOs, and have a typical precision of \u00b10.5\ndex, providing somewhat poorer age discrimination than\nis available with standard HR diagram analyses (\u223c 3-5\nMyrs Gorlova et al. 2003; Allers et al. 2009).\nTo characterize the timescale, efficiency, and products\nof star formation within the Pipe Nebula, we have conducted the first spectroscopic census of B59's stellar population. Our observations discriminate bona-fide B59\nmembers from background giants in the Galactic bulge,\nand establish that these members are late type (K4-M6)\nlow-mass (0.9\u20130.1 M\u2299 ) young stellar objects (YSOs). We\nthen derive estimates of the absolute and relative ages of\nB59's YSOs by comparing their locations within the observational Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram with theoretical models and YSOs in other well known clusters. We\nmeasure B59's median stellar age to be \u223c2.6+4.1\n\u22122.6 Myrs;\nwhile the error bars on this measurement are significant,\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.-\nThe K band image of B59 obtained by\nRom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. (2009), with locations of candidate YSOs observed in this program identified by diamonds and the source number assigned by Brooke et al.\n(2007). The NICER-based extinction map constructed\nby Rom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. (2009) is shown for comparison\nas white contours. The lowest contour represents an extinction of AV =2.5; contours correspond to a 5 mag.\nincrease in extinction up to AV =22.5, and increases of\n10 mag. thereafter.\n\nthe maximum likelihood estimate implies that star formation has persisted within B59 for more than five times\nthe current dynamical timescale and crossing time of\nB59's dense gas.\nIn Section 2, we present our SpeX observations of candidate B59 members. Our method for measuring stellar\nparameters from these spectra is introduced in Section 3,\nalong with our algorithm for placing those objects in the\nHR diagram and inferring ages and masses from pre-main\nsequence evolutionary models. We discuss our results in\nSection 4, and summarize our findings in Section 5. We\nalso include a NIR spectral atlas of TW Hydrae members\nas an appendix to this work.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nUsing the SpeX spectrograph (Rayner et al. 2003) at\nNASA's 2.5 meter Infrared Telescope Facility, we obtained low (R\u223c200) and moderate (R \u223c 2000) resolution spectra of candidate young stellar objects (YSOs)\nin B59 and the Pipe Nebula. Observations were carried\nout during the early mornings of April 14-18 2008 (HST);\ntypical seeing was 0.7\u2032\u2032 , with clear skies interrupted by\nperiods of light cirrus. The bulk of our observations were\ncarried out in SpeX's SXD mode with the 0.3\u2032\u2032 slit, providing nearly contiguous spectral coverage from 0.8 to 2.5\nmicrons with a resolution of R\u223c2000. During a night of\nabnormally poor seeing (\u223c1\u2032\u2032 ) we made use of the larger\n0.5\u2032\u2032 slit, degrading the spectral resolution to R\u223c1200.\n\n\f4\n\nCovey et al.\nTABLE 1\nIRTF/SpeX SXD Observing Log for Candidate B59 Members\nSource\nID\n\nRA\n\nDec\n\n2MASS\nJ\n\n2MASS\nH\n\n2MASS\nKs\n\nSXD\nitime\n\nSXD\nslit\n\nSXD\nJ S/N\n\nSXD\nH S/N\n\nSXD\nK S/N\n\nNTT\nH\n\nNTT\nK\n\n[BHB2007] 1\n[BHB2007] 2\n[BHB2007] 3\n[BHB2007] 4\n[BHB2007] 5\n[BHB2007] 6\n[BHB2007] 7\n[BHB2007] 8 NW\n[BHB2007] 8 SE\n[BHB2007] 9\n[BHB2007] 12\n[BHB2007] 13 NW\n[BHB2007] 14\n[BHB2007] 15\n[BHB2007] 16\n[BHB2007] 17\n[BHB2007] 18 NE\n[BHB2007] 18 SW\n[BHB2007] 19\n[BHB2007] 20\nV359 Oph\nLkH\u03b1 345\nKK Oph A\n\n17:11:03.93\n17:11:04.12\n17:11:11.83\n17:11:14.46\n17:11:16.26\n17:11:16.31\n17:11:17.28\n17:11:18.24\n17:11:18.32\n17:11:21.55\n17:11:25.08\n17:11:26.95\n17:11:27.28\n17:11:29.43\n17:11:30.35\n17:11:41.00\n17:11:41.73\n***\n17:11:43.17\n17:12:00.20\n17:08:54.28\n17:10:48.04\n17:10:08.07\n\n-27:22:55.08\n-27:22:59.44\n-27:26:54.98\n-27:26:54.45\n-27:20:28.82\n-27:25:14.50\n-27:25:08.16\n-27:25:48.94\n-27:25:49.53\n-27:27:41.70\n-27:24:42.67\n-27:23:48.40\n-27:25:28.32\n-27:25:36.89\n-27:26:28.91\n-27:18:36.82\n-27:25:50.26\n***\n-27:30:58.54\n-27:20:18.10\n-27:12:33.03\n-27:40:51.19\n-27:15:18.24\n\n10.46\n9.75\n14.09\n11.62\n11.23\n10.58\n13.61\n***\n>18.4\n12.74\n16.52\n11.88\n13.17\n13.28\n11.91\n10.64\n***\n***\n14.09\n10.54\n9.73\n9.60\n9.07\n\n8.99\n8.79\n12.62\n10.42\n9.70\n9.37\n10.82\n***\n15.12\n10.57\n13.61\n10.14\n10.65\n11.74\n10.00\n8.75\n***\n***\n12.75\n9.64\n9.12\n8.69\n7.23\n\n7.76\n8.05\n11.76\n9.63\n9.07\n8.75\n8.77\n***\n11.95\n8.98\n11.57\n9.08\n9.11\n10.70\n8.89\n7.54\n***\n***\n11.91\n9.17\n8.80\n8.35\n5.80\n\n240\n240\n6240\n1920\n1440\n960\n1920\n1920\n1920\n2400\n2880\n1440\n2400\n2400\n1680\n960\n480\n1440\n1920\n960\n***\n***\n***\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.5/0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.5\n0.3\n0.5\n0.5\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n***\n***\n***\n\n152/52\n136/48\n58/13\n277/41\n132/57\n203/40\n58/12\n***\n***\n122/31\n15/3\n84/32\n120/21\n149/24\n49/19\n146/18\n216/37\n72/32\n47/11\n119/51\n***\n***\n***\n\n243/49\n155/35\n108/26\n344/48\n168/23\n234/41\n261/34\n2/0\n3/0\n230/42\n63/13\n126/42\n351/31\n291/30\n64/32\n150/8\n287/39\n76/40\n92/17\n116/51\n***\n***\n***\n\n293/114\n151/73\n186/40\n347/57\n158/56\n227/63\n325/92\n59/17\n60/16\n348/69\n154/34\n120/3\n494/111\n359/46\n64/66\n106/19\n312/50\n69/55\n127/26\n146/81\n***\n***\n***\n\n9.29\n8.91\n12.69\n10.62\n9.70\n9.37\n10.58\n16.01\n15.35\n11.215\n13.32\n10.14\n10.57\n11.74\n10.23\n8.75\n10.46\n***\n12.66\n9.641\n***\n***\n***\n\n8.29\n8.56\n11.77\n9.77\n9.08\n8.75\n8.77\n12.87\n12.78\n8.98\n11.58\n9.08\n11.44\n10.58\n9.19\n7.54\n9.86\n***\n11.74\n9.17\n***\n***\n***\n\nFor maximum observational efficiency, we chose not\nuse the image rotator to align the slit with the parallactic angle over the course of each night. Spectra of telluric\nstandards taken at slit rotations that differ by 30-60\u25e6 suggest that color-dependent slit losses due to atmospheric\nrefraction are relatively minor, altering the slope of the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) between the J and K\nbands by less than 10%. During our last night of observations we also utilized SpeX's high-throughput, lowresolution (R\u223c200) prism mode to obtain high fidelity\nNIR SEDs for candidate YSOs in B59. During these observations, care was taken to align the slit to within 10\u25e6\nof the parallactic angle, except in cases where the slit was\nrotated to allow observations of individual components of\nan apparent multiple system.\nBrooke et al. (2007) identified candidate YSOs in B59\nby searching for IR excesses in spectral energy distributions (SEDs) constructed from 2MASS, IRAC and MIPS\nphotometry. For the remainder of this paper, we identify these candidate YSOs with a [BHB2007] prefix, followed by the source ID assigned by Brooke et al. in their\nTable 1. We obtained spectra for each of these candidate B59 members, with the exception of two objects\ntoo faint to observe with SpeX ([BHB2007] 10, & 11). A\nK band image of B59 observed by Rom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al.\n(2009) is shown in Figure 2, overplotted with the locations of the candidate YSOs observed in this program.\nOur SXD observations are summarized in Table 1, where\nwe indicate the slit width and exposure time used to\nobtain each source's spectrum. We include for completeness the 2MASS position and magnitudes for each\nsource as well as H and K band magnitudes measured by\nRom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. (2009) from their NTT images of\nthe cluster. We also include positions and 2MASS magnitudes for 3 likely B59 members (V359 Oph, KK Oph\nAB, and LkH\u03b1 345 Oph) with spectral types in the literature that suffice to place each star in the HR diagram.\nTo characterize the more extended population of bright\n\nIR objects that extends across the Pipe, we obtained\nspectra for a sample of objects with K<10 (to ensure\naccessibility to SpeX) and detections at both 24 and 70\nmicrons in an extensive Spitzer survey of the Pipe Nebula\n(Forbrich et al. 2009). The locations of these sources are\nindicated in Figure 1, and their NIR properties are listed\nin the top tier of Table 2. We observed all four sources\n([CLR2010]6 1, 2, 5 and 7) that met our flux criteria and\nare located within high extinction peaks identified by\nAlves et al. (2007), as we considered these sources the\nmost likely bona fide YSO candidates. We additionally\nobserved 6 similar sources that are not associated with\nextinction cores ([CLR2010] 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9). According to the criteria of Forbrich et al. (2009), two of the\nsources in our sample ([CLR2010] 1 & 2) are MIPS excess sources. A third source, [CLR2010] 7, has a MIPS\nspectral index marginally qualifying as class II but is not\nlisted by Forbrich et al. (2009) due to a position mismatch at the source detection stage.\nThe SpeX spectral atlas7 (Cushing et al. 2005, Rayner\net al., in prep; Vacca et al., in prep.) samples many\nspectral types and luminosity classes. To supplement this\ngrid of standards with stars possessing pre-main sequence\nsurface gravities, we observed members of the TW Hydrae moving group and \u03c1 Ophiuchus cluster. The premain sequence standards are listed in the bottom tier of\nTable 2, and spectra of the TW Hya members are shown\nin Appendix A.\nAll data were reduced using SpeX's dedicated IDL reduction package, SpeXtool (Cushing et al. 2004). Telluric absorption was removed using observations of\nA0V stars at airmasses similar to those of the target\n6 For consistency with the [BHB2007] designation adopted for\nthe candidate B59 members identified by Brooke et al. (2007), we\nadopt a source designation of [CLR2010], followed by the source\nnumber given in Table 2, for the IR bright sources we observed\nthroughout the Pipe.\n7 available online at\nhttp://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/$\\sim$spex/spexlibrary/IRTFlibrary.html\n\n\fYSOs in B59\n\n5\n\nTABLE 2\nIRTF/SpeX SXD Observing Log for Pipe/TW Hya Sources\nSource\nID\n\nRA\n\nDec\n\n2MASS\nJ\n\n2MASS\nH\n\n2MASS\nKs\n\nSXD\nitime\n\nSXD\nslit\n\nSXD\nJ S/N\n\nSXD\nH S/N\n\nSXD\nK S/N\n\n[CLR2010] 1\n[CLR2010] 2 NE\n[CLR2010] 2 SW\n[CLR2010] 3\n[CLR2010] 4\n[CLR2010] 5\n[CLR2010] 6\n[CLR2010] 7\n[CLR2010] 8\n[CLR2010] 9\nTW Hya 12\nCD 29-8887 A\nCD 29-8887 B\nCD 33-7795 A\nCD 34-7390 A\nCD 34-7390 B\nCD 36-7429 A\nCD 36-7429 B\nGSC 6659-1080 A\nGSC 6659-1080 B\nGSC 7766-074\nGY 17\nGY 250\nGY 292\nGY 93\nHD 98800 A\nHen 3600 A\nHen 3600 B\nSSS 1207-324\nTW Hya\nTYC 7760-0283\n\n17:14:51.08\n***\n17:14:56.49\n17:15:59.37\n17:19:06.05\n17:20:12.47\n17:22:31.01\n17:26:15.14\n17:27:41.56\n17:29:54.08\n11:21:05.6\n11:09:14.0\n11:09:14.2\n11:31:55.4\n11:21:17.3\n11:21:17.5\n11:48:24.2\n11:48:24.0\n11:32:41.3\n11:32:41.2\n12:35:04.4\n16:26:23.7\n16:27:19.5\n16:27:33.1\n16:26:41.26\n11:22:05.5\n11:10:28.0\n11:10:28.05\n12:07:27.4\n11:01:52.0\n12:15:30.8\n\n-27:22:39.96\n***\n-27:31:08.08\n-27:00:24.75\n-27:06:18.95\n-26:55:09.40\n-23:53:48.76\n-26:44:37.31\n-26:53:46.7\n-25:59:12.79\n-38:45:16\n-30:01:39\n-30:01:38\n-34:36:27\n-34:46:47\n-34:46:44\n-37:28:49\n-37:28:49\n-26:51:55\n-26:52:08\n-41:36:39\n-24:43:13.9\n-24:41:40.5\n-24:41:15.7\n-24:40:18\n-24:46:39.7\n-37:31:53\n-37:31:54.2\n-32:47:00\n-34:42:17\n-39:48:42\n\n10.26\n***\n10.42\n6.99\n13.07\n9.12\n7.52\n9.16\n10.12\n7.29\n9.00\n7.85\n9.09\n7.67\n8.43\n***\n8.60\n10.06\n8.34\n9.84\n9.12\n9.39\n9.42\n11.32\n10.77\n6.40\n8.22\n8.63\n8.62\n8.22\n8.17\n\n8.89\n***\n9.56\n5.72\n9.69\n7.58\n6.06\n7.13\n7.87\n5.83\n8.33\n***\n***\n6.99\n7.73\n***\n7.95\n9.41\n7.66\n9.28\n8.48\n8.40\n8.63\n9.13\n9.77\n5.76\n7.60\n8.07\n8.02\n7.56\n7.50\n\n8.16\n***\n9.04\n5.13\n7.50\n6.67\n5.13\n5.79\n6.19\n5.05\n8.05\n7.18\n7.99\n6.74\n7.49\n***\n7.68\n9.14\n7.43\n9.01\n8.19\n7.85\n8.41\n7.81\n9.27\n5.59\n7.28\n7.80\n7.75\n7.30\n7.31\n\n360\n480\n480\n120\n360\n720\n120\n240\n240\n120\n480\n360\n480\n360\n120\n240\n480\n480\n120\n240\n360\n480\n480\n480\n480\n360\n360\n360\n360\n480\n360\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n\n447/55\n100/44\n86/32\n507/116\n25/5\n229/30\n357/17\n180/64\n38/15\n423/78\n343/113\n628/110\n434/107\n574/105\n241/96\n376/116\n392/99\n219/115\n239/104\n181/77\n227/99\n371/71\n540/93\n136/29\n303/55\n863/84\n269/117\n213/95\n319/112\n501/110\n434/111\n\n654/54\n107/33\n100/32\n794/19\n136/9\n241/10\n474/9\n180/20\n146/43\n726/18\n392/46\n776/50\n451/51\n674/55\n290/48\n473/46\n420/47\n265/51\n285/48\n202/44\n258/51\n435/57\n619/48\n151/41\n330/39\n970/46\n325/49\n245/49\n364/53\n640/57\n525/46\n\n498/84\n106/36\n108/35\n935/58\n141/38\n294/24\n884/21\n182/62\n488/49\n971/56\n346/88\n717/100\n352/103\n608/93\n267/91\n430/87\n343/87\n238/86\n262/81\n201/49\n224/87\n377/93\n514/91\n114/85\n281/42\n783/77\n315/68\n223/75\n329/78\n615/117\n461/82\n\n(\u2206secz .0.1). Hydrogen features were removed from the\nA0V spectra by dividing by a model of Vega, and the\ntarget's true spectral slope and absolute flux densities\nwere recovered by multiplying the target spectrum by a\n\u223c10,000 K blackbody spectrum scaled to match that of\nthe telluric standard (Vacca et al. 2003). Tables 1 and\n2 list the signal-to-noise (S/N) levels measured in the\nJ, H and Ks bands of each source's reduced SXD spectrum. Two S/N estimates are listed for each band: the\nfirst estimate is the S/N calculated directly by SpeXtool.\nThe second estimate is an empirical lower limit to each\nspectrum's S/N generated from the standard deviation of\nrelatively featureless regions in each band (J: 1.215-1.235\n\u03bcm, H: 1.52-1.54 \u03bcm, K: 2.13-2.15 \u03bcm).\n3. ANALYSIS\n\nWe have analyzed these SpeX spectra to distinguish\nbona fide B59 members from contaminating background\ngiants, and to infer the physical properties of each YSO.\nIn \u00a73.1, 3.2 and 3.3, we describe an iterative technique\nthat identifies the spectral type, extinction and veiling\nthat best reproduce the individual features and overall shape of each candidate B59 YSO's spectrum. In\n\u00a73.4, we supplement these spectral measurements with\nphotometry from the literature to estimate the effective\ntemperature (Tef f ) and bolometric luminosity (Lbol ) of\neach target. Placing these YSOs in an observational\nHertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram, we used pre-main\nsequence evolutionary models to infer masses and ages\nfor each object. We present in \u00a73.5 an estimate of B59's\nabsolute age, as well as a relative age estimate derived\nfrom comparison to other clusters with similarly homo-\n\ngeneous photometric and spectroscopic datasets.\n3.1. Estimating Extinction & Veiling From Synthetic\n\nPhotometry\nFollowing Meyer et al. (1997), we assume that a YSO's\nobserved NIR color (e.g., (J \u2212 H)obs ) is due solely to its\nintrinsic photospheric color (e.g., (J \u2212 H)int ), an additional continuum excess from its circumstellar disk (e.g.,\n\u2206(J \u2212 H), such that (J \u2212 H)CT T S = (J \u2212 H)int +\n\u2206(J \u2212 H)), and an independent extinction/reddening\nterm (e.g., E(J \u2212 H) = 0.613 \u00d7 AH ; (J \u2212 H)obs =\n(J \u2212 H)CT T S + E(J \u2212 H)). Algebraically combining\nthe Meyer et al. (1997) CTTS locus (transformed onto\nthe 2MASS photometric system) with a well behaved\nextinction law8 then requires a unique combination of\nreddening and disk excesses/veiling to reconcile a YSO's\nintrinsic and observed (J-H) and (H-Ks ) colors:\n\n8\n\nAH = 2.512 \u00d7 (J \u2212 H)obs \u2212\n1.527 \u00d7 (H \u2212 Ks )obs \u2212 1.254\n\n(1)\n\n\u2206(J \u2212 H) = (J \u2212 H)obs \u2212\n0.613 \u00d7 AH \u2212 (J \u2212 H)int\n\n(2)\n\nRom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al.

(2005)\nfrom large numbers of 2MASS stars. Given the agreement between\nthese two studies, we adopt the Indebetouw et al.

To\nestimate each YSO's extinction and NIR excess at the exact epoch that the spectra were obtained, we calculate\nsynthetic NIR photometry from each target's SpeX spectrum following the prescription presented by Covey et al.\n(2007) in their \u00a73.3.1. Using these JHK magnitudes, and\nassuming intrinsic photospheric colors characteristic of\nK7/M0 type stars, we can therefore obtain a good initial\nestimate of each YSO's extinction (AH ) and \u2206(J-H) and\n\u2206(H-Ks ) color excesses.\n3.2. Extinction and Veiling Resistant Spectral\n\nClassification\nNumerous investigators have identified H and K band\nspectral indices sensitive to a star's luminosity class and\nspectral type (Kleinmann & Hall 1986; Ali et al. 1995;\nWallace & Hinkle 1997; Meyer et al. 1998; Aspin 2003;\nIvanov et al. 2004; Allers et al. 2007). We present in Table 3 a set of indices well suited for measuring stellar\nspectral types from moderate resolution (R\u223c1000\u20132000)\nspectra. Each feature's local continuum is measured from\na linear fit to the median flux in two neaby regions ('Cont.\n1' and 'Cont. 2' in Table 3). Integrating the difference between the expected continuum and the actual\nflux in the line (defined by the 'Line Center and 'Line\nWidth' columns of Table 3), and dividing by the continuum flux density in the center of the line region, provides\nan Equivalent Width (EqW) measure of the strength of\neach feature. Equivalent width measures are convenient\nfor spectral classification of YSOs: equivalent widths are\nrelatively insensitive to extinction, which affects both the\nline and the local continuum equally, and ratios of closely\nseparated lines are relatively robust to excess continuum\nflux, as both lines will be diluted equally and the sum\neffect will cancel out.\nThe strength and shape of water absorption in the\nH and K bands has also been identified by numerous\nauthors as a useful spectral type and luminosity class\nindicator (e.g., Wilking et al. 1999; Reid et al. 2001;\n\nGeballe et al. 2002; McLean et al. 2003; Slesnick et al.\n2004; Allers et al. 2007; Weights et al. 2009), but is less\namenable to characterization as an Equivalent Width.\nWe defined two indices to characterize water absorption\nin the H and K bands; these indices are calculated as:\nIndex =\n\n< Band1 > / < Band2 >\n< Band2 > / < Band3 >\n\n(4)\n\nwhere <X> simply denotes the mean flux level within\nthe range of each band as given in Table 4.\nTo account for any residual sensitivity to extinction or\nveiling in our spectral indices, we compared our target's\nindex values to those measured from artificially reddened\nand veiled spectral standards. As described in \u00a73.1, synthetic photometry from each SpeX spectrum produces\nan initial estimate of each target's extinction and (JH)/(H-K) color excesses assuming the standard K7/M0\nspectral type. Adopting the characteristic J band veiling\n(rJ = FFex\n= 0.25) measured by Cieza et al. (2005) for a\n\u2217\nlarge sample of CTTSs sets the initial absolute scale for\nthe veiling fluxes implied by each source's \u2206(J-H) and\n\u2206(H-Ks ) color excesses:\n\u2206J = 2.5 \u00d7 Log(rJ + 1)\n\u2206H = \u2206J + \u2206(J \u2212 H)\n\u2206H\n\nrH = 10 2.5 \u2212 1\n\n(5)\n\nWe then iteratively adjusted each target's assumed absolute J band veiling and spectral type (and thus intrinsic\nphotospheric colors) to identify the self-consistent spectral type/extinction/veiling combination that best replicated the target's measured spectral indices and overall\nSED shape. Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate our two dimensional spectral classification of GY 292 and [BHB2007]\n5, respectively. GY 292 appears to be moderately veiled\n(\u2206(J-H): 0.22; \u2206(H-Ks ): 0.35), but [BHB2007] 5 shows\nno evidence for veiling, so these two stars demonstrate\nthe sensitivity of these spectral indices to the presence of\nveiling. Veiling has the largest impact on the two water\nindices shown in the upper left panels of Figures 3 and\n4: standards veiled to match GY 292 are significantly\ncompressed compared to the unveiled standards used to\ntype [BHB2007] 5.\n\n\fYSOs in B59\n\n7\n\n2.5\n\nK water\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nAH:2.27\n\u2206(J-H):0.22 \u2206(H-K):0.35\n\n2.0\nCO 2.34 / Ca 1.98\n\nF6\nGY 292\nF2\nGiants\nF1\nF2\nF5\nF7\nG5\nG1\nG2\nF0\nF4\nF6\nF3\nF0\nF6\nF2\nF4\nF5\nK1\nG6\nG3\nF5\nF9\nF8\nK0\nG8\nG6\nG4\nG5\nG4\nSubgiants\nK2\nG3\nG6\nK3\nK5\nK7\nG7\nM0\nK1\nM1\nK5\nDwarfs\nK7\nM0\nK0\nM2\nM3\nK1\nG9\nM1\nM2\nAH:2.27\nM3\nM4\nK3\n\u2206(J-H):0.22\nM5\nM5\nM6\nK4\nK2\nK5\nM9\nK6\nM2\nM0\nM7\nM3\nK7\nM4\nM5 M1\nM8\nM7\nM6\n\n\u2206(H-K):0.35\n\n0.8\n\n1.5\n1.0\nGY 292\n\n0.5\n0.0\n\nK6\nM5 M4 K7\nM6\nM3\nK5M2\nK4 M0\nM7\nM1 K3\nK1\nK0\nG9\n\nF2\nF2\nK1\nG7\nF6\nG6\nF0\nM8\nG3G6\nG4\nM7\nG5\nM6\nM3\nM4\nF5\nM5\nF6\nM2\nK7\nM0\nM3\nG5\nFG6\n8G2\nM1\nK5\nK\nFF1\n6F0\nM1\nG3\nF2\nF5\nK3\nM0\nG8\nM\n2\nF4\nG4M5\nK7\nF7\nK52\nK0K1\nF9\nG1F3\n\nK2\n\nM9\n\n0.7\n\n3.0\n\n1.2\n\nM5\n\nMg 1.71/Si 1.59\n\n2.5\n2.0\nM4\n\n1.5\n\nM5\n\n0.5\nM8\n\n1.6\n\n0\n\n2.0\n\nF7\nF5\n\nF5\n\nF4\nF2\n\n1.5\n\nM5\n\n0.5\n0.0\n\nGY 292\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n3\nMg 1.58/CO 1.62+1.66\n\n4\n\n5\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nF6\nAH:2.27\n\u2206(J-H):0.22 \u2206(H-K):0.35\n\n1.0\n\nM6\n\n-0.5\n-1\n\n2\n4\n6\nCO 2.3 / <Na 2.21 + Ca 2.26>\n\n2.5\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nAH:2.27\n\u2206(J-H):0.22 \u2206(H-K):0.35\n\nM2\nM2M1\nM1\nM0\nM7\nK7\nM0\nK7\nM5\nK5 K5\nM6\nM3\nM9\nM4\nM2\nK3\nM1\nK7\nK1K2F8\nK5\nG1\nG5K0\nG8\nK6\nK4\nG6\nG2\nM0\nG4\nK2 K1\nF6F9\nK3\nK1\nG6\nG3\nG7\nG6\nF6 F4\nG4\nK0 G9\nF6\nG5\nF2\nG3\nF5\nM7\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\nM3\nM3\n\n1.4\nH water\n\nKI 1.518/Al 1.67\n\n1.0\n\nM5\n\nM4\n\nM3 G7 M3\nM2\nM2\nM1K7\nM6\nM3\nM4\nM1\nM2\nK7\nM0 M1\nM5\nK6\nK5\nM0\nK4\nK5\nK3\nG3\nK2 K0\nG9\nG6 K1\nK1\nG5\nG6\nG4\n\n5\n\nGY 292\nF2\nM0\n\nK7K5\n\nK0 G4G8\n\nF2\nG3 G5\nG2\nG6\nK3 K2 F6\nK1\n\n10\n15\nMg 1.51/1.70 dip\n\nF5\n\n20\n\nFig. 3.- Two dimensional spectral classification of GY 292: each panel shows luminosity and gravity sensitive H\nand K band spectral indices presented in \u00a73.2.

Derived Spectral Types\n\nApplying our classification algorithm to these spectra\nidentifies two of the B59 candidate YSOs and the majority of the IR excess stars throughout the Pipe as likely\ngiants: we classify [BHB2007] 5, [CLR2010] 3 and 9 as\nreddened giants or supergiants, [CLR2010] 8 as a giant\ncarbon star, and [CLR2010] 4, 5, 6 and [BHB2007] 17 as\nOH/IR stars, likely residing in the Galactic Bulge. The\nspectra of these stars are shown in Figure 5 along with\n\nspectra of known giants obtained by Lan\u00e7on & Wood\n(2000) and Cushing et al. (2005). Our classification of\n[BHB2007] 5 and 17 as background giants is reinforced\nby their non-detection at X-ray wavelengths in an XMM\npointing containing B59 (Forbrich et al. 2010, in press).\nThe spectra of the confirmed B59 YSOs are shown in\nFigures 6 and 7, with their derived spectral types, extinctions, and JHK veilings presented in Table 5. We tested\nthe accuracy of these results by comparing the parameters we measure for four \u03c1 Oph YSOs to those reported\nby Luhman & Rieke (1999). We derived spectral types\nfor GY 292 (K5), GY 17 (K5), GY 250 (M1) and GY 93\n(M5); Luhman & Rieke (1999) derived spectral types for\nthese objects of K8, K6, M0, and M4 respectively. The\ntypes assigned to GY 17, 93, and 250 agree within 1 subclass, while the type we assign to GY 292 is earlier by\ntwo/three subclasses (following Kirkpatrick et al. 1991,\nour classification scheme omits types K6 and K8). On\nthe basis of this comparison, we adopt a conservative uncertainty of \u00b12 subclasses in our derived spectral types.\nSimilarly, comparing the extinctions and veilings we derive with those reported by Luhman & Rieke (1999) suggest that we achieve \u03c3AH \u2248 0.5 mag and \u03c3rK \u2248 0.35.\nTwo sources, [CLR2010] 1 and 7, present somewhat\n\n\f8\n\nCovey et al.\n2.5\n\nK water\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nAH:1.66\n\u2206(J-H):0 \u2206(H-K):0\nM1\nM2\n\nK2K3\nM4\nM3\nK4\nM5\nK5\nM6\nM0\nK6\nK7\nM2 M1\nM3\n[BHB2007]\nM4\nM5\n\n0.8\n\n5\n\nM5\nM7\nM8M9\n\n1.5\n[BHB2007] 5\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\nM7\n\n0.7\n\n3.0\nM5\n\nMg 1.71/Si 1.59\n\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\nM4\nM5\n\nM3\n\n1.4\nH water\n\n2.0\n\nM3\n\n1\n2\n3\nMg 1.58/CO 1.62+1.66\n\nK2\n\nM9\n\n2\n4\n6\nCO 2.3 / <Na 2.21 + Ca 2.26>\n\n2.5\n\nF7\nF5F4\n\n[BHB2007] 5\n\n0\n\nF2\nF2\nK1\nF6\nG7M7\nG6\nM8\nF0\nG3G6\nG4\nG5\nM5\nM6\nM3\nF5\nM4 G4\nF1\nM5\nM2\nF6\nFG6\n8F5\nM0\nM3\nM1\nK5\nF6\nF0\nG5\nM1\nG3\nK3\nF2\nM0\nF7\nG\n8K7\nM\n2\nF5\nK7\nF4\nK2\nK0K1\nF9\nF3G2\nG1\n\n0\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nAH:1.66\n\u2206(J-H):0 \u2206(H-K):0\n\nM2\nM1\nM2\nM1 M0\nM7\nK7\nM0\nK7\nM5\nK5\nM3\nM6\nK5 M9\nM2\nM4\nK3\nM1\nK7\nK5\nK1K2F8\nG1\nG5G8\nK6\nK4\nK0\nG2G6\nF9 F5\nM0\nK3\nK1\nG4\nK2 K1\nG6\nG3 F6\nG7\nG4G6\nK0 G9\nM8 M7\nG5\nF6F2 F6 F5 F4\nG3\nF2\nM6\n\n-0.5\n-1\n\n1.6\n\nKI 1.518/Al 1.67\n\n1.2\n\nK6\n\nK7\nM5\nM4 M3\nM6K5\nM2\nK4 M0\nM7\nM1\nK3\nK1\nK0\nG9\n\n0.5\n\nM6\n\n1.0\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nAH:1.66\n\u2206(J-H):0 \u2206(H-K):0\n\n2.0\nCO 2.34 / Ca 1.98\n\nF6\nF2\nF1\nF4\nF2\nF2\nF5\nF7\nG5\nG1\nG2\nF0\nF6\nF0\nF4\nF3\nF9\nF6\nF8\nF5\nF5\nK1\nG3\nG6\nK0\nG4\nG6G8\nG5\nG4\nK2\nG3\nG6\nK5\nG7K3\nK7\nK1 M0\nM1\nK5\nG9\nK0\nK7\nM0\nK1\nM2\nM3\n\n1.5\n\n5\n\nF6\n\nM5\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n4\n\nGiants\nSubgiants\nDwarfs\nAH:1.66\n\u2206(J-H):0 \u2206(H-K):0\n\nM5\n\nM4\n\nM3 G7\nM3\nM1\nM2\nM2\nK7\nM6\nM3\nM4\nM1\nK7\nM2\nM5\nK6\nK5\nK4\nM0\nK5\nK3K2K0 G3 M0 M1\nK1G9 G5\nK1\nG4G6 G6\n\n[BHB2007] 5\n\n5\n\nF2\nK7 K5\nM0\nF2 G3\nG6 K2 F6\nG2\nG5 K1\nK0\nG8 G4 K3\nF5\nF8\nF6\n\n10\n15\nMg 1.51/1.70 dip\n\n20\n\nFig. 4.- The two dimensional spectral classification plots for candidate YSO [BHB2007] 5; symbols are as in Figure\n3. [BHB2007] 5 appears to be a mid-late K star, with giant-like surface gravity; visual inspection of its spectrum\nconfirms it as a background giant rather than a bona-fide YSO (see Fig. 5).\n\nambiguous spectra.\n[CLR2010] 7 possesses a subgiant/giant-like surface gravity, with prominent Paschen\n\u03b2, Paschen \u03b3, and Brackett \u03b3 emission features as seen in\nsome YSOs. [CLR2010] 7 is also located on the edge of\na Pipe extinction core, and is on the lower boundary defined by Forbrich et al. (2009) to select candidate class\nII sources based on their MIPS spectral index. While\nthese properties are consistent with a YSO classification,\nOjha et al. (2007) identify [CLR2010] 7 as a likely high\nmass-loss AGB star in the Galactic Bulge in their analysis of detections by the Mid-course Space Experiment.\nThis classification is also consistent with the observed\nproperties of [CLR2010] 7, explaining its strong HI emission as a signature of strong stellar winds. We tentatively classify this source as a giant star, and include its\nspectrum in Figure 5. [CLR2010] 1 is more ambiguous:\nthis source possesses a low (sub-giant) surface gravity,\nand has a location in the HR diagram consistent with\nthat of other B59 members (see \u00a73.3 for a discussion of\nHR diagram placement). This HR diagram location implies a rather young age for [CLR2010] 1, however, which\nis somewhat inconsistent with the source's lack of NIR\nexcess/disk emission or mass accretion sensitive emission\nlines. Indeed, [CLR2010] 1's NIR photometry is also consistent with that of a reddened background giant/subgiant. Definitively resolving [CLR2010] 1's status will\nrequire additional observations; for now we include it in\n\nTable 5 and Fig. 6 as a potential Pipe YSO, but exclude\nit from our population analysis of B59 members.\nOne of the IR excess stars located outside of B59, however, is likely a newly identified YSO. [CLR2010] 2 lies\nin the stem of the Pipe, within an Alves et al. (2007) extinction core (see Fig. 1 for its exact location), and was\nidentified by Forbrich et al. (2009) as a new candidate\nYSO (source 16 in their object list). While detected as a\nsingle source by MIPS, [CLR2010] 2 proved to be a visual\nbinary when observed with SpeX: we obtained spectra\nof both the NE and SW components, and the spectral\nindices measured from both sources are consistent with\npre-main sequence surface gravities. Strong HI, HeI, and\nCa II emission lines are also visible in the spectrum of\n[CLR2010] 2 SW, consistent with the source being an\nactively accreting YSO. This source was also identified\nas an H\u03b1 emission line source by Kohoutek & Wehmeyer\n(2003), indicating that the HI emission persists over long\ntimescales. These observations suggest that [CLR2010] 2\nSW is a bona fide YSO associated with the Pipe Nebula,\nand [CLR2010] 2 NE is a promising candidate as well.\nThe detection of H\u03b1 from [CLR2010] 2, and the low extinction estimates we derive from our SpeX observations,\nindicate that follow-up optical spectroscopy of the 6707\u00c5\nLi line may be a tractable means of definitively resolving each component's pre-main sequence status.

Calculating Tef f and Lbol\nTo compare the properties of B59's YSOs with theoretical models of pre-main sequence evolution, we adopted\nthe SpT to Tef f conversion developed by Luhman et al.\n(1998). The Tef f implied by each source's spectral type\nis shown in Table 6. In the spectral type range occupied\nby most B59 members, our \u00b12 subclass spectral type\nuncertainty corresponds to an \u223c 300 K uncertainty in\ntemperature.\nWith extinction and veiling estimates for each candidate B59 member, we are able to calculate stellar luminosities from their NIR photometry. We followed\nHillenbrand (1997) in calculating each YSO's bolometric luminosity as:\n\nLog(Ltot /L\u2299 ) = 0.4 \u00d7\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\n4.75 \u2212 H \u2212 AH \u2212 DM + BCH\n\n(6)\n\nwhere DM is the distance modulous to B59 (d=130 pc,\nDM = 5.569; Lombardi et al. 2006) and BCH is the H\nband bolometric correction for each star's spectral type\nas tabulated by Kenyon & Hartmann (1995); the values\nadopted for each star are included for reference in Table\n6.\nWe also calculate the purely stellar component of each\nYSOs bolometric luminosity by removing the H band\nveiling flux, expressed in magnitudes (see \u00a73.2 for the\ntransformation between the veiling flux ratio in a given\nband (e.g, rH ) and the photometric excess in that band\n(e.g., \u2206 H):\nLog(Lstel /L\u2299 ) = 0.4 \u00d7\n\n4.75 \u2212 H + \u2206H \u2212 AH \u2212 DM + BCH\n\n\u0001\u0011\n\n(7)\n\nWe adopt the measured 2MASS H band magnitude for\nisolated B59 members in this calculation, enabling us to\nperform an identical analysis of YSOs with known spectral types in other well studied star forming regions. Objects with nearby (<4\u2032\u2032 ) companions may be blended in\n2MASS due to that survey's relatively large pixels (\u223c2\u2032\u2032 );\nfor those sources ([BHB2007] 2, 8 NW & SE, 13 NW,\n18 NE & SW; [CLR2010] 2 NE & SW), we adopt the\nsynthetic H band magnitude measured from our spectra,\nnoting that the SpeXTool reduction pipeline produces\nspectra with a first-order correction for slit losses derived\nfrom the observations of the telluric standard.\nBoth luminosity estimates (total and stellar-only) are\nlisted in Table 6 and shown in Figure 8. Accounting for\nthe uncertainties in each of the input parameters results\nin a total uncertainty for these luminosity estimates of\n0.3 dex. The difference between the total and stellar\nluminosity estimated for a given YSO is usually less than\n0.2 dex, indicating that the veiling correction, while not\nnegligble, does not exceed the overall error in each YSO's\nlocation in the HR diagram.\n3.5. Inferring B59's Median Stellar Age\n\nWe have used the pre-main sequence (PMS) evolutionary models calculated by D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1994)\nand updated in 1998 (DM98 hereafter), and those calculated by Baraffe et al. (1998), to infer the age and mass of\neach candidate B59 YSO. These parameters were determined by interpolating between model points with temperatures and luminosities similar to that of each YSO.\nThese theoretical models do not account for accretion luminosity, so for this comparison we adopted the veiling\nsubtracted value of Lstel for each YSO.

We calculate this timescale as the\nmedian age of all likely B59 members with reliable age estimates (i.e., all YSOs listed in Table 6 except [CLR2010]\n2 NE & SW, which may not be linked to B59). We prefer\nthe median to a standard mean because it is more robust\nto outliers with extreme ages (e.g., [BHB2007] 19). B59's\nmedian stellar age, as inferred from DM98 PMS tracks\nusing veiling-corrected luminosity estimates (Lstel ), is 2.6\nMyrs.\nOur confidence in the age estimates we calculate here is\nreinforced by our ability to independently reproduce the\nage estimate derived by Luhman & Rieke (1999) for their\nsample of \u03c1 Oph members. Following Luhman & Rieke\n(1999) by comparing each star's total (non-veiling corrected) luminosity to the DM98 tracks, and adopting\ntheir estimated distance of 166 pc. (m \u2212 M = 6.1),\nwe measure a median stellar age for \u03c1 Oph of 0.21\nMyrs, consistent with the \u223c0.3 Myr median stellar age\nLuhman & Rieke (1999) derived.\nWe also measured median stellar ages for other, well\nstudied young clusters to provide an indication of B59's\nrelative, rather than absolute, age. These cluster age\nmeasurements require YSOs catalogs with measured\nspectral types and JHK photometry to estimate extinction and veiling corrected stellar luminosities using\nthe same algorithms we applied to B59's YSOs. Studies by Luhman and collaborators provide such catalogs\nfor YSOs in Taurus, Rho Ophiuchus, and Chameleon\n(Luhman & Rieke 1999; Luhman et al. 2006; Luhman\n2007). We have placed these objects on the HR diagram\nusing the same routines applied to our B59 data, adopting the following distances to each region: Taurus \u2013 140\npc., Oph \u2013 126 pc., Cha \u2013 170 pc (Kenyon et al. 2008;\nWilking et al. 2008; Luhman 2008). Table 7 presents the\nmedian stellar age implied for each cluster by the DM98\nand Baraffe et al.

Instead, for YSOs in other regions, we simply adopt the mean CTTS J band veiling\nmeasured by Cieza et al. (2005), which implicitly assumes that CTTSs dominate the population of each star\nforming region. This J band excess is an overestimate of\nthe minimal veiling flux detected from WTTSs, however,\nsuch that we will under-estimate WTTSs intrinsic stellar luminosity, and thus overestimate their age. Our age\nestimates for Taurus, \u03c1 Oph and Chameleon will therefore be slightly biased towards older ages in proportion\nto the number of WTTSs in the sample: we expect this\nto be a minimal effect for Taurus and \u03c1 Oph, but potentially of some importance for the age we measure for the\nChameleon star forming region.\n3.6. Uncertainties in Derived Ages\n\nOur measurement of B59's median stellar age is subject\nto a few distinct statistical and systematic uncertainties.\nThese affect the relative and absolute precision of our\nmeasurement in different ways, so we discuss them each\nbelow.\n3.6.1. Random/Statistical Age Uncertainties\n\nOur measurement of cluster median stellar ages are\nsusceptible to (presumably) random uncertainties due to\nobservational error and sampling effects. Age uncertainties introduced by observational errors are straightforward: errors in a YSO's temperature and luminosity will\nshift its location in the HR diagram, corresponding to\nan error in the inferred mass and/or age. In the temperature/luminosity regime occupied by B59's YSOs, luminosity is primarily sensitive to a star's age, while its\ntemperature is a better indicator of its mass. We therefore estimate the age errors that could be introduced by\nuncertainties in our luminosity estimates: we find that a\n0.3 dex luminosity error corresponds to an age error of\n\u223c125%. This is, however, the error in any individual age\nestimate: as we are determining the median stellar age of\n\n\fYSOs in B59\n\n11\n\nTABLE 7\nMedian Cluster Ages\n\nCluster\nB59\nTaurus\n\u03c1 Oph\nChameleon\n\nNstars\n18\n224\n61\n185\n\nDM98 Median\nAge (Myrs)\n2.59\n1.53\n1.04\n2.59\n\nB98 Median\nAge (Myrs)\n4.37\n2.63\n3.63\n3.02\n\n4\nHD 181596\nK5 III, Av=6.5\n[BHB2007] 5\n\nFlux + Offset\n\n3\n\nHD 196610\nM6 III, Av=3.25\n\n2\n\n[CLR2010] 3\n\n[CLR2010] 9\n[CLR2010] 7\n\n1\nMY Cep\nM7 Iab\n\nR Lep\nCarbon Star\nAv=10\n\n2.0\n\n[CLR2010] 8\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n4\n\nFlux + Offset\n\nFlux + Offset\n\n0\n2.5\n\nGl 686\nOH/IR star\n\n3\n\n[CLR2010] 6\n[CLR2010] 5\n\n2\n[BHB2007] 17\n\n1\n\n[CLR2010] 4\n\n0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n2.0\nWavelength (microns)\n\n2.5\n\nFig. 5.- Spectroscopically identified giant stars in B59\nand the Pipe Nebula.

We calculate an estimate of\nthe statistical uncertainty in each cluster's median stellar\nage as \u221aN125% , and present the resulting uncertainty in\ncluster\nTable 7.\n\nStatistical\nUncertainty (1\u03c3)\n29%\n9%\n16%\n9%\n\nSystematic\nUncertainty\n100\u2013175%\n100\u2013175%\n100\u2013175%\n100\u2013175%\n\nSampling errors are perhaps the more subtle effect, but\ncould be important for a sparse cluster like B59. A simple demonstration of this effect can be seen by examining\nthe ages inferred for the 18 B59 YSOs listed in Table 6.\nThe median age of these B59 YSOs, as inferred from the\nDM98 models, is bounded by the 2.42 Myr and 2.59 Myr\nages estimated for V359 Oph and [BHB2007] 3, respectively the 9th and 10th oldest YSOs in the list. The relatively narrow age range bounding the median, however,\nis somewhat misleading. There are at least three B59\nYSOs that were too heavily embedded to be observationally accessible to SpeX: [BHB2007] 10 and 11, classified\nas Class 0/I and Class I sources by Brooke et al. (2007),\nand 2M17112255, discovered and classified as a Class I\nsystem by Riaz et al. (2009). These YSOs are presumably quite young: arbitrarily assigning them ages of 0.5\nMyrs would shift the age ordering such that the YSO\ndefining B59's median stellar age would be [BHB2007]\n20, with an age of 1.37 Myrs according to the DM98\nmodels. This would represent a \u223c50% age error, somewhat larger\n\u221a than the 30% age estimate predicted by the\nsimple Ncluster calculation described above. We lack,\nhowever, a robust statistical description of the effect, so\nmerely caution the reader that the formal statistical uncertainties reported in Table 7 may be underestimates\nfor a sparse cluster like B59.\n3.6.2. Systematic Age Uncertainties: Veiling Corrected\nLuminosities\n\nOne systematic effect which could affect our age estimates concerns the treatment of veiling flux in calculating each YSO's luminosity. Deriving ages from each\nYSO's total luminosity, rather than the veiling corrected\nstellar luminosity, typically reduces the YSO's implied\nage by \u223c1.5 Myrs over the range of ages considered here.\nThe median stellar age implied for B59 by comparing\neach YSO's total, non-veiling corrected luminosity estimate to the DM98 tracks is 0.87 Myrs, as opposed to\nthe veiling corrected age estimate of 2.6 Myrs. This\nrepresents a nearly 75% decrease in the cluster's median stellar age, demonstrating that correctly accounting\nfor veiling luminosity is necessary to accurately infer a\nYSO's age. As the PMS tracks considered here do not\naccount for emission from accretion or a circumstellar\ndisks, we believe the correct approach is to infer ages\nfrom veiling-corrected luminosity estimates. We caution\nthe reader, however, that many other investigators adopt\nnon-veiling corrected bolometric luminosity estimates to\nderive YSO ages: as demonstrated above, this difference\nin approach results in age differences of 50-100%, and\nshould be carefully considered in reconciling our results\nwith other studies in the literature.\n3.6.3.

(1998) models identify \u03c1 Oph as older\nthan Chameleon and Taurus.\nThese different relative age orderings arise from differences in the stellar population sampled in each cluster,\ncombined with distinct isochrone slopes predicted by the\ntwo sets of PMS tracks. The temperature dependent offset between the 5 Myr DM98 and Baraffe isochrones is\nshown in the left panel of Figure 10. The Baraffe models\nimply consistently older ages for a given HR diagram location, but the age difference increases rapidly towards\nhigher Tef f . This means that the relative age orderings\nof single stellar populations may not be preserved across\nmodels if the YSOs observed sample different temperature ranges. This is precisely the cause of the different\nrelative ages inferred for \u03c1 Oph in the DM98 and Baraffe\nmodels:as demonstrated in the right panel of Figure 10,\nthe median temperature of the \u03c1 Oph cluster stars is significantly larger than that of the other clusters analyzed\nhere.\n3.6.4.

(2008), the choice of\nPMS models from which to infer YSO ages has a significant affect on the absolute age derived for a given cluster. Hillenbrand et al. (2008) found that the PMS models computed by DM98 and Baraffe et al. (1998) predict\nthe youngest and oldest ages, respectively, for a YSO of\na given temperature and luminosity. We therefore use\nthese two sets of model tracks to span the full range of\nB59's potential absolute age. Using the same veiling corrected luminosities derived above for B59's YSOs, but\ninferring ages from the \u03b1 = 1 PMS tracks calculated by\nBaraffe et al. (1998), results in a median stellar age for\nB59 of 4.4 Myrs, or roughly 70% older than the median\nstellar age inferred from the DM98 models.\nModel dependent age differences are often attributed\nto luminosity offsets between equal age isochrones in two\nsets of PMS tracks. This suggests that, while the absolute ages predicted by two sets of PMS tracks may differ,\nthey should produce similar relative age orderings for a\ngiven sample of clusters. Table 7 reveals, however, that\nthis simple expectation is not necessarily borne out in\n\nUncertainties in a cluster's distance can also introduce\nerrors in the inferred age: a closer distance implies a\nlower luminosity, and thus an older age, for a YSO of\na given apparent magnitude. A concrete example of of\nthis effect is provided by \u03c1 Oph, whose distance has recently been revised to \u223c125 parsecs from a previous estimate of \u223c160 parsecs. The 0.3 Myr estimate of \u03c1 Oph's\nage derived by Luhman & Rieke (1999) was based on the\n160 parsec distance estimate. Replicating their analysis\nwith a revised distance of 125 parsecs increases the derived median stellar age to 0.63 Myrs, twice as old as\nthe previous estimate. Estimates of the distance to B59\nand/or the Pipe Nebula are scarce: the two most recent\ndistances measured for the Pipe are 130+13\n\u221220 parsecs and\n145\u00b116 parsecs, obtained by Lombardi et al. (2006) and\nAlves & Franco (2007), respectively. We have adopted\nthe Lombardi et al. (2006) distance for the luminosity\nand age measurements presented here, but we note that\nthe Alves & Franco (2007) distance implies in a median\nstellar age (inferred from veiling corrected luminosities\nand DM98 tracks) for B59 of 1.7 Myrs, or decreased by\nroughly 35% from our primary age estimate.\n3.6.5. Total Error Budget for B59's Age Estimate\n\nIn summary, our measurement of B59's absolute age\nis subject to statistical errors at the \u223c30% level, such\nthat B59's median stellar age (adopting veiling corrected\nluminosities and inferred from the DM98 models) is\n2.6\u00b10.8 Myrs. Several systematic uncertainties could\nshift the median stellar age derived for B59, however, by\nas much as 100%. Adding these effects in quadrature, we\nfind that systematic uncertainties could introduce errors\nas large as 150% into our measurement of B59's absolute\nage. Including potential systematic effects therefore revises the error budget for B59's median (DM98) stellar\nage to 2.6+4.1\n\u22122.6 Myrs.\n4. DISCUSSION\n4.1.

Likely B59 members (including previously studied\nmembers V359 Oph & Lk H\u03b1 345) are shown twice; red dots indicate their total bolometric luminosity, and black dots\nindicate their stellar luminosity after subtracting H band veiling. Objects classified as background giants are shown\nwith open diamonds, as are [BHB2009] 8SE & NW, whose spectra are too noisy for reliable HR diagram placement.\nThe DM98 model grid is shown for comparison as solid and dotted lines.\n\nThe prompt star formation paradigm agrees well with\nthe evolutionary timescales expected for dense cores that\nlack significant internal or external support. Acted on by\ngravity alone, a core should collapse in roughly one freefall time, \u03c4f f = (3\u03c0/32G\u03c1)1/2 . Hydrodynamic models of\nundriven turbulent molecular clouds predict only slightly\nlonger evolutionary timescales, as the turbulent support dissipates on \u223c1-2 free-fall timescales (Klessen et al.\n2000). Offner et al. (2008), for example, find that star\nformation activity ceases after 0.75 \u03c4f f in their simulations of star formation within undriven turbulent molecular cores.\nThe uncertainties associated with our measurement of\nB59's age are sizable, but the most straightforward interpretation of this result is that star formation activity\nbegan in B59 nearly 3 Myrs ago. The presence of heavily embedded (and presumably young) Class 0/I objects\nwithin B59 (Brooke et al. 2007; Riaz et al. 2009) also implies that this star formation activity has persisted to the\npresent day. If the oldest stars in B59 formed from the\ndense core currently associated with the cluster, these\nobservations would indicate a lower limit of 3 Myrs for\nthe core's lifetime. A star formation timescale for B59\ncomparable to 3 Myrs is by no means startling in ab-\n\nsolute terms. Indeed, while the stellar content of B59\nappears somewhat older than that of the \u03c1 Oph, Taurus,\nand Chameleon star forming regions, the inferred star\nformation timescales agree to within a factor of two.\nExpressing B59's age in units of the core free-fall time\nand the core's crossing time is also useful for interpreting the core's physical evolution. Adopting the density (n(H2 ) = 104 cm\u22123 ; \u03c1 = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221220 g cm\u22123 ),\nradius (R = 0.19 parsecs = 5.9\u00d71012 km), and velocity dispersion (\u03c3v =0.37 km/sec, calculated from 0.86\nkm/sec FWHM) tabulated for the B59 dense core by\nRathborne et al. (2009), we calculate \u03c4f f \u223c0.35 Myrs\nand \u03c4cross \u223c0.5 Myrs. These calculations describe B59's\ncurrent state; if B59 is evolving from a lower density to\nhigher density configuration, these timescales would have\nbeen somewhat longer in the past than they are today.\nIntensive observations of the dense gas within B59 have\nnot revealed any kinematic signatures of rapid collapse\n(Rathborne et al. 2009). If B59 is evolving relatively quiescently, the timescales we derive today are likely comparable to those of B59's recent past.\nThe uncertainties on B59's age permit that star formation may have begun as recently as the core's last dynamical time, or as long as \u223c13 dynamical timescales ago.\n\n\fYSOs in B59\n\n15\n\n1\n\nLog Lum.\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0.7 Mo\n0.1 Myr\n0.5 Mo\n\n0.5 Myr\n1 Myr\n3 Myr\n5 Myr\n\n0.3 Mo\n\n-2\n\n10 Myr\n0.1 Mo\n\nB59\n\n-3\n\n50 Myr\n100 Myr\n\nTau\nCha\nRho Oph\n\n-4\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\nTeff\n\n3000\n\nFig. 9.- HR diagram locations for YSOs in nearby young clusters, calculated using JHK photometry and assuming\nstellar luminosities (subtracting off H band veiling).

(right panel) Tef f s of the stars\nsampled from each cluster analyzed here. The Cha & Taurus samples are dominated by cooler stars, where the disparity\nbetween the B98 and DM98 models is \u223c1 Myr. B59 and \u03c1 Oph are successively warmer: at these temperatures, the\nDM98 and B98 models predict ages that can differ by 4 Myrs.\n\n\f16\n\nCovey et al.\n\nThe maximum likelihood value, however, suggests that\nB59 has been forming stars for \u22486 crossing or free fall\ntimes. Extinction maps of B59 also indicate that the core\nis spatially coherent, having not undergone significant\nfragmentation as it formed stars (Rom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al.\n2009). Taken at face value, the maximum likelihood\nvalue of B59's star formation timescale suggests that\nB59 could join a short, but growing, list of dense cores\nthat appear to have resisted global collapse and sustained ongoing star formation for several dynamical\ntimes. Swift & Welch (2008) examined the dense gas\nand stellar population of the L1551 star forming region,\ndemonstrating that L1551 has been forming stars for \u223c5\nMyrs, or \u22655 \u03c4f f ; they identify stellar feedback as a likely\nsource of support against collapse within this region. As\nwe find for B59, Swift & Welch (2008) also find that\nL1551 contains stars over a broad range of evolutionary\nstages (Class 0 through III). Similar results have been\nreported for the young cluster AGFL961; Williams et al.\n(2009) conclude that either disk evolution proceeds more\nrapidly in clustered environments, or that star formation\npersists in clusters over several dynamical timescales.\nFinally, Tan et al. (2006) present observationally-based\ncalculations that suggest ages of \u223c3-4 \u03c4f f for several rich\nyoung clusters that are still forming stars (ie, \u03c1 Oph, IC\n348, ONC, etc.). These measurements suggest that some\ndense cores can sustain star formation over a few dynamical timescales, including in relatively low-mass cores like\nB59, which does not appear to host massive stars.\nWhat physical mechanism could be supporting these\ncores against collapse, extending their lifetimes beyond\nthat expected for cores in free fall collapse? As noted\nabove, one possibility is stellar outflows: Matzner (2007)\ncalculate that outflows may support clusters against collapse for several crossing times. This mechanism could\nexplain B59's relative stability, particularly given that\nOnishi et al. (1999) and Riaz et al. (2009) find evidence\nfor an active outflow within the B59 core. A recent\nammonia survey of the Pipe, however, finds little evidence for significant non-thermal motions within B59's\ndense gas, as would be expected if bulk outflow motions are the core's main support against gravitational\ncollapse (Rom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. 2009; Rathborne et al.\n2008). High-resolution observations of the kinematics of\nB59's dense gas are required to clarify the extent to which\nit (and, by extension, outflows from previous generations\nof protostars) could support B59 against collapse.\nThe collapse of a molecular core may also be strongly\neffected by radiative feedback from the young protostars\nit contains. Krumholz, Klein & McKee (2007) used simulations of massive molecular cores to demonstrate that\nprotostars can contribute significant heating to a collapsing core, thereby suppressing fragmentation. This heating does not, however, appear to slow mass accretion and\ncollapse within the core: much of the radiation 'leaks'\nout of optically thin holes in the core (Krumholz et al.\n2009). Offner et al. (2009) extended this investigation\ninto the regime of low-mass star formation, finding a similar reduction in stellar multiplicity due to reduced fragmentation, as well as a significant reduction in the mass\naccretion rate of the earliest formed protostar. These\nsimulations suggest that radiative feedback could play\nsome role in extending B59's star formation timescale.\nMagnetic fields are a final physical mechanism that\n\nis often invoked to support cloud cores against collapse. Magnetic fields have been a fundamental component of star formation models for decades (Nakano\n1984; Shu et al. 1987; Mouschovias & Ciolek 1999), but\nobservational constraints on the strengths of magnetic\nfields within molecular clouds are difficult to obtain (e.g.,\nCrutcher et al. 2009). Past measurements suggest magnetic fields may contribute appreciable amounts of support to molecular cores (Troland & Crutcher 2008), and\nrecent polarization measurements in the Pipe Nebula indicate the presence of a \u223c17 \u03bcG magnetic field within\nB59 itself (Alves et al. 2008). This suggests that magnetic fields may be providing B59 with some support\nagainst collapse, but this is a relatively weak statement:\nmagnetic fields can extend a dense core's lifetime arbitrarily, depending on the field strength adopted.\n4.2. The Star Formation Efficiency of B59\n\nAs the discussion above demonstrates, there are several\nmechanisms which could plausibly explain B59's maximum likelihood star formation timescale. To provide additional leverage for comparing observations of B59 with\npredictions of theoretical models of star forming cores,\nwe now consider B59's star formation efficiency in addition to its characteristic timescale.\nB59's present-day star formation efficiency (SFE) can\nbe characterized as the mass of the cluster's stellar population divided by the core's initial gas mass. The total mass of all B59 YSOs analyzed here is \u223c8 M\u2299 according to the DM98 models, and 12 M\u2299 according to\nthe Baraffe et al. (1998) models. Brooke et al. (2007)\nand Riaz et al. (2009) also provide preliminary mass estimates for [BHB2007] 10, 11, and 2M12112255, the B59\nYSOs that were too heavily embedded to be observed\nwith SpeX. These embedded YSOs contribute an additional 0.7 M\u2299 to B59's total stellar mass, bringing B59's\ntotal stellar mass to \u223c9-13 M\u2299 .\nB59's initial gas mass can be approximated as the sum\nof its stellar and gas masses. Extinction maps indicate\nthat B59 contains \u223c20 M\u2299 of dense gas, implying an\ninitial core mass of \u223c29-33 M\u2299 . This suggests B59's\npresent-day SFE is \u223c30-40%, depending on the choice\nof models used to infer stellar masses. Combining this\nSFE with B59's median stellar age produces an estimate\nof the SFE/\u03c4f f of the B59 dense core. B59's sizable\nage uncertainty translates into a large range of allowed\nSFE/\u03c4f f values: 3-40%, though the probability distribution is strongly asymmetric, peaking at a maximum\nlikelihood value of \u223c6%.\nThe SFE/\u03c4f f values predicted by theoretical models for star forming cores cover a large range, with\nslower star formation rates corresponding to models incorporating some additional physical mechanism (driven\nturbulence, magnetic fields, outflows, etc.) to support cores against collapse. Unsupported models typically produce SFE/\u03c4f f values \u223c 10-20%, while models\nthat incorporate additional support often predict proportionally lower SFE/\u03c4f f values. As one example,\nthe moderately supercritical (ie, prone to gravitational\ncollapse) magnetic models of V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n(2005) produced SFE/\u03c4f f values \u223c 5%, whereas earlier non-magnetic models by the same authors produced\nSFE/\u03c4f f values \u223c15% (V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2003).\nThe magnetically subcritical models of Nakamura & Li\n\n\fYSOs in B59\n(2008), which also incorporate feedback from stellar outflows, produce SFE/\u03c4f f values of 1% or less.\nThe theoretical models calculated by Price & Bate\n(2009) are arguably the best match to B59's actual physical structure. These models (indicated hereafter as 'the\nPB09 model grid') incorporate both magnetic fields and\nradiative feedback, and follow the evolution of a cloud\ncore whose mass (50 M\u2299 ) and radius (\u223c0.2 pc) are reasonably close to the values which likely characterized B59\nprior to the onset of active star formation. The PB09\nmodel grid spans magnetic fields of various strengths,\nbut all models were supercritical, with mass-to-flux ratios ranging from 3 to \u221e. Though the models were only\nallowed to evolve over a timespan corresponding to 1.5\n\u03c4f f , or 0.35\u20130.5 \u03c4f f following the formation of the first\nstar in the core, the implied SFE/\u03c4f f values range from\n\u223c30% for the model lacking both magnetic fields and\nradiative feedback, to \u223c 6% for the model incorporating radiative feedback and the strongest magnetic field\n(B0 =65\u03bcG). In analyzing the range of star formation efficiencies produced by their model grid, PB09 note that\nmagnetic fields appear to play a more important role\nthan radiative feedback in quenching star formation.\nB59's maximum likelihood SFE/\u03c4f f value of \u223c6% is\ncontained within the range of values predicted by the\nPB09 models, but B59's observed magnetic field strength\n(B\u223c17 \u03bcG) is only \u223c1/4 that adopted in the least efficient PB09 model (B\u223c65 \u03bcG). The PB09 models and the\npresent-day B59, however, represent significantly different time periods in the evolution of a star forming core.\nIt would be interesting to see what properties the PB09\nmodels might have if they were allowed to evolve to \u223c5\n\u03c4f f : would the magnetic field diffuse out of the core, such\nthat the measured magnetic field strength would better\nagree with what we observe in B59 today?\nIt is too early to draw detailed conclusions, but the\nagreement between B59's observed properties and the\npredictions of the PB09 model grid are intriguing, and\nsuggest that magnetic support and radiative feedback\nhelp support B59 against collapse.\n4.3. The Spatial Extent of Star Formation in Pipe\nThe suggestion that magnetic fields may be important\nfor understanding star formation within the Pipe Nebula\nis also consistent with the results of the polarization survey conducted by Alves et al. (2008). Alves et al. (2008)\nmeasure a significant spatial gradient in the component\nof the Pipe's magnetic field aligned with the plane of the\nsky, ranging from \u223c17 \u03bcG in B59 to \u223c65\u03bcG in the Pipe's\n'Bowl'. As Alves et al. (2008) indicate, this gradient correlates with star formation activity: the weakest, most\npoorly aligned field vectors lie in B59, where the bulk of\nthe Pipe's star formation activity is taking place, while\nareas with stronger, better aligned magnetic field vectors\nappear devoid of star formation activity.\nIn this context, it is interesting to note the location of [CLR2010] 2, the candidate YSO identified by\nForbrich et al. (2009) in their MIPS survey of the Pipe,\nand subsequently confirmed as a likely YSO by our spectroscopic analysis. This candidate YSO lies in the Pipe's\n'Stem', where the magnetic field appears to be stronger\nthan in B59, but not as strong as in the Bowl. This YSO\nalso displays a rich emission line spectrum, suggesting it\nis a young, heavily accreting YSO, which would be con-\n\n17\n\nsistent with a picture in which star formation activity was\njust beginning in the Neck of the Pipe. We note, however,\nthat [CLR2010] 2 does not appear to be heavily embedded; indeed, [BHB2007] 10 and 11 appear to be in significantly earlier evolutionary stages than [CLR2010] 2,\nmaking it difficult to conclude that the onset of star formation activity is simply progressing linearly from B59\ntowards the Bowl of the Pipe.\n5. SUMMARY\n\n1. We obtained and analyzed JHK SpeX spectra for\n20 candidate B59 YSOs, and 10 additional mid-IR\nbright sources throughout the larger Pipe Nebula.\nWe measured temperature and luminosity sensitive\nspectral indices from these spectra, and determined\nthe extinction, NIR color excesses, and spectral\ntype required to self-consistently reproduce each\ntarget's spectral energy distribution. This analysis leads us to re-classify [BHB2007] 5 and 17,\npreviously identified as candidate B59 members,\nas background giants, and to identify [CLR2010]\n2 SW as a promising candidate YSO in the stem\nof the Pipe. None of the mid-IR bright candidates\noutside of the Stem of the Pipe were found to be\nYSOs\n2. For each candidate B59 YSO with reliable spectra\nand photometry, we derived effective temperatures\nand luminosities, with and without correction for\nnon-photospheric flux. Using these measurements\nto place each YSO in the HR diagram, we inferred\nages and masses for each YSO from theoretical\npre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. B59's median stellar age, as inferred from the DM98 models and accounting only for statistical uncertainties,\nis 2.6\u00b10.8 Myrs. Including potential systematic\neffects revises the error budget for B59's median\n(DM98) stellar age to 2.6+4.1\n\u22122.6 Myrs.\n3. Comparing the median stellar ages implied for several star forming regions by different pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks demonstrates that the\nconstruction of even a relative age ordering requires\ncareful attention to sampling of each region's stellar population. Despite this sensitivity, both sets of\ntracks studied here imply that B59 is at least as old\nas, if not slightly older than, the more well-studied\n\u03c1 Oph, Taurus, and Chameleon star forming regions. The dominant source of error in this conclusion is the uncertainty in the distance adopted\nto each cluster: we minimize other potential systematic errors by applying a consistent set of algorithms to a homogeneous set of catalogs of young\nstars in each cluster.\n4. The maximum likelihood median stellar age we\nmeasure for B59, and the observed properties of\nthe dense gas in the region, suggests that the B59\ndense core may have been stable against collapse\nand actively forming stars for roughly 6 dynamical timescales, with a star formation efficiency per\ndynamical time of \u223c6%, though the uncertainty in\nour age measurement permits a significant range of\npossible SFE/\u03c4f f values (3\u201340%). These proper-\n\n\f18\n\nCovey et al.\nties agree well with recent star formation simulations that incorporate sub-critical magnetic fields\nand radiative feedback from protostellar heating.\n\nThe authors owe a debt of gratitude to Bill Golisch,\nPaul Sears, and Bobby Bus for their generous assistance\nin obtaining efficient and accurate observations.

(2005) with additional pre-main sequence spectral\nstandards, we obtained SpeX SXD spectra of several members of the TW Hya moving group. Observed during the\nsame nights as our B59 candidates, these spectra share the same instrumental set-up and reduction process as our\ntarget spectra. The H and K band portion of these spectra are shown in Figure 11, ordered such that earlier type\nobjects are found higher in the figure. Spectral features sampled by the indices presented in \u00a73.2 are also labeled.\nAs most B59 members are heavily reddened, the z and J band portion of their observed spectrum was typically quite\nnoisy, and thus not useful for measuring spectral types. This region contains most of the HI Paschen series, the Ca II\ntriplet and the He I 10830 \u00c5 line, however, which are often seen in emission in young, actively accreting stars. The\n0.8-1.3 \u03bcm SpeX spectrum of TW Hya, an actively accreting CTTS, is shown in Figure 12 for comparison with Figure\n7, which shows 0.8-1.3 \u03bcm spectra of candidate or confirmed B59 members with J band emission features.\nTo provide the community with moderate resolution NIR pre-main sequence spectral standards, we have made these\nspectra publicly available at http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~kcovey/CoveyB59SpeX.tar.gz.\nREFERENCES\nAli, B., Carr, J.
