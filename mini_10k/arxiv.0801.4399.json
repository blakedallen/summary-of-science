One of the most productive examples of that kind is the so called Schwinger\nModel (SM) [1] i.e. a system consisting of a massless\nfermion interacting with abelian gauge field in two spacetime dimensions, together with its subsequent modifications (for instance N fermionic flavors, fermion given a\nnonzero mass or chiral version of the model). Among\nits nontrivial and noteworthy features one can mention\nconfinement, the existence of topological sectors, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and fermion condensate,\ngauge boson mass generation and axial anomaly. Beside these peculiarities, essential mainly to high energy\nphysics, the SM, either massless or massive, of one flavor or more (as well as other models), has attracted the\nother researchers attention, for instance in the context of\ncondensed matter physics [2, 3]. Here, much interest has\nalso been payed to three dimensional models as QED3 .\nBut QED2 is of certain importance for the investigation\nof electrons in metals as well [3].\nThere are plenty of papers dealing with different aspects of the SM, but relatively small concern [4] has so\nfar been devoted to the analysis of infrared anomalous\ndimensions of the fermionic correlation functions, which\nbelongs to the both above areas of interest: confinement\nin quantum field theory and long-range correlations in\ncondensed matter. The situation here is the more interesting, that all Green's functions, at least in the massless\ncase, may be found explicitly thus allowing for the analytic and exact results [1, 5, 6].\nThe question of field operators products in QFT having other than canonical dimensions, dates back to the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: torado@fuw.edu.pl\n\nWilson's papers [7], where the author discovered this phenomenon in the Thirring model [8] and \u03c64 theory. Since\nthat time much work has been done to understand the\nbehavior of the Green's or correlation functions in various systems, with special focus, at least in field theory,\non the ultraviolet. The calculations have been mainly\nbased on perturbation theory with further application\nof the renormalisation group methods. QED and QCD\nmay serve here as important examples [9]. In the present\npaper we would like to consider the SM fermion propagator (a fermion correlation function) and its anomalous\ndimension in the infrared.\nOne of the known and important features of this model,\nmaking of it a valuable testing layout for certain aspects\nof QCD, is the existence of nontrivial topological sectors [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. These topological sectors\nor instantons reveal their influence on expectation values\nof products involving fermion fields. This is connected\nwith the fact, that objects of the kind \u03a8(x)\u03a8(y) are not\nchirally invariant and have nonzero matrix elements between distinct topological vacua [16]. Hence, if the true\nvacuum state (the so called \u03b8-vacuum) is defined through\nthe sum, a Bloch-like superposition of topological vacua\n|n > needed to maintain the cluster property [17]:\n|\u03b8 >=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nein\u03b8 |n > ,\n\n(1)\n\nthe off-diagonal terms arising when one calculates the\nexpectation values < \u03b8|\u00d4|\u03b8 > not necessarily vanish.\nThe instanton background not only gives additional\ncontributions to the propagator (or other fermion functions) [10, 18] but is likely to essentially change the longrange correlations between charged particles, due to the\nappearance of fermionic zero modes.. It is then worthwhile to examine the fermion propagator for large spacetime or euclidean separations to find out, how values of\nanomalous dimensions depend on the topological sectors.\nEven if they are not of direct physical meaning because\nof their gauge dependence, the relative values between\ndifferent sectors are interesting and their differences do\n\n\f2\nnot vary with the gauge parameter. As far as we know,\nno such calculation (which seems necessary for the complete infrared analysis of the propagator) has so far been\nperformed. It is worth recalling here that for the fourpoint (purely fermion) function the essential modification\nof the bound state singularity in two-momentum space -\nwhich is a simple pole as k = 0 - has been established in\nhigher instanton sectors: k = \u00b11, \u00b12 (there appeared additional nonpolar - branch point - contributions) [19].\nAlthough anomalous dimensions for fermion fields are\ngauge dependent quantities, they, as mentioned, eventually might be distinct in different topological sectors.\nTherefore, a natural question arises whether one is able\nto make all noncanonical exponents vanish, by the appropriate choice of gauge. Does a kind of Fried-Yennie\ngauge exist for all sectors or for each sector separately?\nThe SM is a perfect tool to answer these questions since\nthe fermion propagator is known in all sectors, thanks\nto the calculations performed in the euclidean space. To\nthat aspect we devote section II.\nAnother interesting task is to find a gauge independent function and analyse its long-range behavior. Such\nfunctions are of certain importance in condensed matter\nphysics but should also constitute essential objects in investigations concerning fundamental problems of QCD,\nlike confinement for instance, similarly as Wilson loop\ndoes. It is well known, that analytical properties of the\nordinary (gauge variant) function are gauge dependent.\nFor example in QED, the mass-shell singularity of the\nelectron propagator in p-space which, in one gauge, is a\nsimple pole, in another becomes a branch point.\nGauge invariant function, however, is not an unequivocal notion. In section III we use the function deriving\nfrom Schwinger [20] (see the footnote in the quoted work)\nand [1] in the form:\n#\n\"\nZ\n< 0|T (\u03a8(x) exp \u2212ig\n\ndz\u03bc A\u03bc (z) \u03a8(y))|0 > ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nwhere \u03b3(x, y) is a certain space-time path from x to y.\nThe function (2) has been widely used in the literature\nfor various systems [4, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], sometimes with\ncontradictory results. One may hope that this kind of an\namplitude describes the propagation of physical particles.\nHowever, one has to keep in mind that (2) is a path dependent object and, therefore, not unique. Considering\nthe simplest case of a straight line, (probably more suitable for the ultraviolet asymptotics) which is tractable\nanalytically, we find the change of the infrared behavior\nfrom power law decay to exponential one. This effect was\nshown to be existent (but cutoff dependent) and actually\npath insensitive in QED3 [21] and also demonstrated in\nthe Schwinger Model [4], although without considering\nother than k = 0 instanton sectors. We show, yet, that\nit appears independently of the gauge-field topology. A\nkind of an average over different paths (but still for k = 0)\nwas performed in [4] showing a slightly faster decay, however without changing the leading exponential behavior.\n\nIn section IV we consider another type - although\nnot entirely unrelated - of the gauge independent function, defined as the vacuum amplitude of the dressed (and\ngauge invariant) fermion fields of the Dirac type [26]:\nR 2\n\u03bc\n\u03a8\u0303(x) = e\u2212i d zF\u03bc (z,x)A (z) \u03a8(x) ,\n(3)\n\nwhere F\u03bc satisfies \u2202z\u03bc F\u03bc (z, x) = g\u03b4 (2) (z \u2212x)1 . Our choice\nof F\u03bc reduces the propagator, again with all topological\ncontributions taken into account, to that considered in\nsection II, provided the Landau gauge was chosen. This\nis due to the fact that the F\u03bc function used, is purely\nlongitudinal and couples only to \u2202A, which disappears in\nthe Landau gauge [21]. As we will see in section IV, the\nchoice of the function F\u03bc is related to the definition of\nthe string in (2).\nII.\n\nGAUGE VARIANT PROPAGATOR\n\nAs written in the Introduction the original Schwinger\nModel consists of a massless fermion field \u03a8 interacting\nwith a gauge boson A\u03bc . The Lagrangian density for this\nmodel has the following form:\nL(x) = \u03a8(x) (i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 g\u03b3 \u03bc A\u03bc (x)) \u03a8(x)\n1\n\u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd (x)F\u03bc\u03bd (x) ,\n4\n\n(4)\n\nwith a gauge-fixing term, if needed.\nThe space-time has one time and one space dimension.\nIt is then natural to choose the fermion field in the simplest form of the two-component spinor, this size being\ndetermined, for the even number of dimensions D, by\nthe value 2D/2 . In this case, for the 2 \u00d7 2 Dirac gamma\nmatrices one can choose the representation given below:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 1\n0 \u22121\n1\n\u03b30 =\n,\n(5)\n,\n\u03b3 =\n1 0\n1 0\n5\n\n0 1\n\n\u03b3 =\u03b3 \u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nFor the metric tensor we use the convention:\ng 00 = \u2212g 11 = 1 ,\nand the antisymmetric symbol \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd is defined by:\n\u03b501 = \u2212\u03b510 = 1 ,\n\n1\n\n\u03b500 = \u03b511 = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nDirac's original suggestion for the static charge in the 3+1 dimensional electrodynamics, was to take the dressing in the Lorentz\nnoncovariant - but local in time - form:\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03a8\u0303(t, x) = exp \u2212\n\nig\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd3 y\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n\u2207A(y) \u03a8(t, x) .\n|x \u2212 y|\n\nLater this formula was modified to account for moving electrons [27]\n\n\f3\nbut whenever it is required by the mathematical rigor,\nthe considering of the corresponding euclidean space is\nassumed.\nThe nonperturbative formula for the fermion propagator was given already in the first Schwinger papers [1]\nand later rederived by other methods. It may be given\nthe following form:\nS(0) (x \u2212 y) =\n= S0 (x \u2212 y)e\n\n(7)\n\n\u2212 2i\n\nR\n\nd2 ud2 wJ \u03bc (u;x,y)\u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (u\u2212w)J \u03bd (w;x,y)\n\nat y:\n\u2202\u03bcz J \u03bc (z; x, y) = g(\u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 y)) .\n\nThe symbol S0 (x) denotes the free fermion propagator,\n6x\n1\ni.e. S0 (x) = \u2212 2\u03c0\nx2 \u2212i\u03b5 , and index (0) on the l.h.s of (7)\nrefers to the trivial (k = 0) instanton sector.\n\n,\n\nwhere \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (u \u2212 w) is a massive (of mass squared equal to\ng 2 /\u03c0) vector boson propagator, in general gauge dependent, i.e. the propagator of the Schwinger boson. The\ncurrent J \u03bc may be written as:\nJ \u03bc (z; x, y) = g\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u2202\u03bdz [D(z \u2212 x) \u2212 D(z \u2212 y)] =\n(8)\n= g(g \u03bc\u03bd + \u03b3 5 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd )\u2202\u03bdz [D(z \u2212 x) \u2212 D(z \u2212 y)] .\nIt can be easily checked, with the use of:\n\u2737z D(z) = \u03b4 (2) (z) ,\nthat this auxiliary current is not conserved and describes\nthe creation of a charged particle at x and its anihilation\n\nA.\n\nLandau gauge\n\nIf one chooses \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (x) to be transverse function, i.e.\nsatisfying \u2202x\u03bc \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (x) = 0, as Schwinger in his original\npapers did, one arrives to the following, well known, form\nof the propagator:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nS(0) (x \u2212 y) = S0 (x \u2212 y) exp \u2212ig 2 \u03b2(x \u2212 y) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere we introduced a function \u03b2 defined by the twomomentum integral and expressible through cylindrical\nfunctions:\n\n\u0011\nd2 p \u0010\n1\nip(x\u2212y)\n1\n\u2212\ne\n=\n2\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n(p \u2212 g /\u03c0 + i\u01eb)(p2 + i\u01eb)\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\np\np\n\uf8f2 i 2 \u2212 i\u03c0 + \u03b3E + ln g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /4\u03c0 + i\u03c0 H (1) ( g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)\n0\n2g h\n2\n2\ni\n=\np\np\n\uf8f3 i 2 \u03b3E + ln \u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /4\u03c0 + K0 ( \u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)\n2g\n\n\u03b2(x \u2212 y) =\n\n(9)\n\nZ\n\nSymbol \u03b3E denotes here the Euler constant and functions\n(1)\nH0 and K0 are Hankel function of the first kind, and\nBasset function respectively.\nFrom (10) and (11) one can easily deduce the IR\nasymptotics, considering euclidean or spacelike infinity.\nThe canonical dimension is associated with the free field\nand, therefore, appears already in the coefficient S0 (x).\nThe anomalous one comes from the infrared behavior of\nthe function \u03b2. For (x \u2212 y)2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e this behavior is dictated by the logarithmic function, since K0 is exponentially decreasing for large arguments. The leading term\ntakes the form:\ne\u03b3E /2\nS(0) (x \u2212 y) \u223c \u221a S0 (x \u2212 y)(\u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)1/4 . (12)\n2\nIn this case the anomalous dimension is equal to \u22121/2\nand this reflects the known infrared behavior of S(0) (p)\nconst\nin momentum space: (\u2212p\n2 )5/4 [28, 29]. The long-range\ncorrelation is then enhanced with respect to the noninteracting case, contrary to, what is called, Luttinger-type\n\nx\u2212y\n\ntimelike\n\nx\u2212y\n\nspacelike .\n\n(11)\n\nbehavior. The obtained value, negative in the Landau\ngauge, may, however, be freely modified by a gauge transformation.\nBy the proper modification and extension of the formula (7) (spoken of in detail in [18]) for the case with\ninstantons, where zero modes of the Dirac operator contribute to the propagator (for the sector k, the number\nof these modes is equal to |k| [30]), one arrives to the\nformula for the k = \u00b11 sectors:\n\u0001\n2\nig\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 i\u03b3 5 sin \u03b8 e\u03b3E +ig \u03b2(x\u2212y) .\n3/2\n4\u03c0\n(13)\nThe angle \u03b8 comes from the definition of the true, physical vacuum of the theory given in (1). The formula (13)\nwith the use of the infrared approximation of (11) leads\nto:\nS(1) (x \u2212 y) =\n\nige\u03b3E /2 e\u2212i\u03b3\nS(1) (x \u2212 y) \u223c\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\n5\n\n\u03b8\n\n*\n\n1\n. (14)\n(\u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)1/4\n\n\f4\nAlthough in the spinor space the matrical structures\nof (12) and of (14) are different, their scaling properties\nare identical, so the anomalous dimension in this sector is\nstill equal to \u22121/2. The asymptotic (noncanonical) scale\ninvariance is then maintained. One should emphasize\nhere, that apart from (12) and (14), no other algebraic\nterms arise. The long-range expansion of (11) shows, that\nsubleading terms have an exponential character deriving\nfrom the behavior of the Basset function.\nB.\n\nLongitudinal contributions\n\nIn this section we verify, how gauge transformations\ninfluence the obtained values of anomalous dimensions in\nall topological sectors. For the trivial sector k = 0, the\nsimplest idea is to move back to (7) and replace \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (x),\nwhich previously was chosen to be transverse, with the\nquantity:\n\u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u25b3T\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2192 \u25b3T\u03bc\u03bd (x) + \u25b3L\n\u03bc\u03bd (x) ,\n\n(16)\n\nIts form is dictated by the longitudinal part of the current J \u03bc . If we analyze the formula (37) of [18] together\nwith (9) and (30), it becomes obvious that (16) will be\ncommon for each instanton sector, since, while passing\nfrom k = 0 to k = \u00b11, all terms additionally appearing\nin the exponent are transverse and, therefore, not sensible to the substitution (15).\nThe above result agrees with that obtained by Landau\nand Khalatnikov [31] and later rederived by Zumino [32]\nfor ordinary QED. The topological sectors are absent in\nQED3+1 and, obviously, were not consiered at the time,\nbut the transformation property described by (16) turns\nout to be general.\nNaturally, there exists a wide class of functions F (x),\none can select, but we restrict ourselves to those arising in\nR\u03be gauges, with an unessential modification. We assume\nthen:\nZ\nF (x \u2212 y) = \u03be d2 wD(x \u2212 w)\u25b3(w \u2212 y) ,\n(17)\nwhere \u25b3(w \u2212 y) is a 2D Klein-Gordon propagator for a\nparticle of certain mass, which, without a real change\nof the infrared asymptotics, may be chosen\n\u221a to be equal\nto the mass of the Schwinger boson: g/ \u03c0. With this\nchoice, it can easily be verified that the additional factor (16) reduces to exp[i\u03beg 2 \u03b2(x \u2212 y)] leading to the\nasymptotics:\nS(0) (x \u2212 y) \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u03b3E /2\n\u221a\n2\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03be\n\nS0 (x \u2212 y)\n\nS(1) (x \u2212 y) \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3E /2\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03be\n\n(18)\n\n\u2212i\u03b3 5 \u03b8\n\nige\n2\u03c0 3/2\n1\n\u00d7\n.\n(\u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)(1+\u03be)/4\ne\n\n\u221a\n2\n\nAs may be seen above, thanks to the universality of the\nfactor (16), there exists a gauge \u03be = 1, for which in\nboth sectors the anomalous dimensions disappear and\nthe propagator recovers its canonical dimension. What\nis more, in this gauge S(0) (x \u2212 y) = S0 (x \u2212 y). This is\neasily understandable on the basis of perturbation calculation [29]. For \u03be = 1, the gauge boson propagator\nbecomes proportional to g\u03bc\u03bd . Therefore, if one draws\nany Feynman diagram with two external fermion 'legs',\neach internal line containing this function and joining two\nvertices leads to the summation of the kind\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03b11 \u03b3 \u03b12 * ... * \u03b3 \u03b12k+1 \u03b3\u03bc ,\n\n(15)\n\nand see the dependence of the results upon different\nL\nchoices of \u25b3L\n\u03bc\u03bd (x). Using \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd F (x), one can\neasily find from (7) and (9), that there would appear\nin (10) an additional, multiplicative factor, which reads:\nexp[\u2212ig 2 (F (x \u2212 y) \u2212 F (0))] .\n\n\u00d7(\u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)(1\u2212\u03be)/4 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u03b11 , \u03b3 \u03b12 , ...\u03b3 \u03b12k+1 come from either vertices or\nfermion propagators (remember that the free fermion\npropagator is proportional to \u03b3) squeezed between these\ntwo vertices. The number of those \u03b3's is always odd (the\nnumber of fermion propagators always exceeds by one\nthe number of vertices). Consequently, the corresponding expression vanishes, since any odd number of gamma\nmatrices may, in two dimensions, always be reduced to\nonly one, by subsequent applications of the formula:\n\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03c1 = g \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03c1 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03c1 = g \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03c1 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u01eb\u03c1\u03bb \u03b3 \u03bb . (20)\nAfter the reduction we simply apply \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3\u03bc = 0, which\ncan also be deduced from (20).\nOn the other hand S(1) (x \u2212 y) remains nontrivial even\nin this gauge. Due to its nonperturbative and topological nature, this simple reasoning based of perturbative\nFeynman diagrams may not be applied.\n\nIII.\n\nGAUGE INVARIANT, PATH DEPENDENT\nPROPAGATOR\n\nOne of the candidates for a gauge invariant one fermion\nGreen's function is that originating from the Schwinger's\npaper [20] (some kind of 'string expression' appeared in\nthe Dirac's paper too [26]):\nS inv (x \u2212 y) =\n\n(21)\n\"\n\n=< 0|T (\u03a8(x) exp \u2212ig\n\nZ\n\n#\n\ndz\u03bc A\u03bc (z) \u03a8(y))|0 > .\n\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nThe gauge independence of Sinv (x \u2212 y) my be easily verified, yet this quantity depends now on the chosen path\n\u03b3(x, y). Two questions come immediately into view. One\nis practical: for which path is it possible to analytically\n\n\f5\nevaluate the vacuum expectation value (21)? The other\nis more fundamental: is there any physical justification\nfor the choice of one \u03b3 before another?\nIn practice the calculation of (21) is possible only for\nthe simplest choices, as straight line for instance. Such a\npath is certainly a good option for the ultraviolet asymptotics, since then x is close to y and the curve may be\napproximated with a short section of a straight line. For\nthe infrared asymptotics we need infinitely long path,\nbut, on the other hand, the long-range behavior should\nnot depend too strongly on the contour peculiarities for\nfinite values of z. This is to some extent supported by\nthe results of [4].\nThe choice of the path \u03b3, as well as of any other form\nof the invariant propagator, is related to the selection of\nthe gauge for the noninvariant function. For instance\nthe straight line path corresponds to the Fock gauge\n(z\u03bc \u2212 x\u03bc )A\u03bc (z) = 0 [33] since, in this case, the string\nin (21) disappears and both invariant and noninvariant\nfunctions equal each other. This means that the gauge\nindependence of (21) becomes somewhat illusory. This\nis as if one told that the propagator calculated in certain fixed gauge is gauge independent. Obviously it is!\nSimilarly as the position of the moving body in a fixed\nmoment t = t0 is time independent. Therefore the main\npoint is to ascertain which path is the most convenient\none (which might also mean that certain gauge or class of\ngauges is privileged). On the other hand, this choice can\nbe ambiguous. It is likely that each type of experiment or\nmeasurement has its own preferable path and, therefore,\none is unable to define it in a versatile way. Only a set of\nuniversal features for a unconfined particle is guaranteed\nto be preparation independent. One should not expect\nthen, that all measurements performed over an electron\n(charged particle) obtained by the ionization of an atom\nwith strong laser impulse give identical outcome as those\nover a trapped particle in the solid body.\nNevertheless the propagator defined in (21) has found\nits applications (see for instance [22, 25, 34]) and, certainly, is worth being investigated with the topological\ncontributions taken into account. Without going too\ndeeply into above questions, we restrict ourselves, in the\npresent work, to the segment of the straight line enclosed\nbetween x and y, for which (21) may formally be calculated in all instanton sectors.\nIt will be convenient to write down the string expres-\n\nsion in the source form:\n#\n\"\nZ\n\u03bc\ndz\u03bc A (z) =\nexp \u2212ig\n\n(22)\n\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\n\u0014\n\n= exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\nd zC\u03bc (z; x, y)A (z) ,\n2\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere we introduced a certain new current:\nZ\ndw\u03bc \u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 w) ,\nC\u03bc (z; x, y) = g\n\n(23)\n\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nsatisfying:\n\n\u2202\u03bcz C \u03bc (z; x, y) = g(\u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 y)) .\n\n(24)\n\nIt is worth noting that this divergence is identical to (9),\nwhich means that the difference of the two currents J \u03bd\nand C \u03bc is transverse:\nJ \u03bc (z; x, y) \u2212 C \u03bc (z; x, y) =\n(25)\nZ\n\u0002 5 \u03bc\u03b1 z \u03b2\n\u0003\n= g \u03b3 \u01eb \u2202\u03b1 \u2202z \u2212 (\u2737z g \u03bc\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202z\u03bc \u2202z\u03b2 )\ndu\u03b2 D(z \u2212 u) .\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nAs we will see below, this transversality guarantees the\ngauge invariance of the final expression. Now we calculate the fermion propagator using functional integral\nformalism, where it is defined as the derivative over\nfermionic sources \u03b7 and \u03b7 of the generating functional:\nZ(\u03b7, \u03b7, J) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\neik\u03b8 Z (k) [\u03b7, \u03b7, J] =\n\n(26)\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\neik\u03b8\n\nZ\n\n\u0014 Z\nD\u03a8D\u03a8DA(k) exp i d2 x(L(k) (x)\n\n\u0015\n+ \u03b7(x)\u03a8(x) + \u03a8(x)\u03b7(x) + J \u03bc (x)A(k)\n(x))\n,\n\u03bc\n(k)\n\nwhere A\u03bc is the gauge field restricted to the k-instanton\nsector, and L(k) is the Schwinger Model Lagrangian den(k)\nsity with the substitution A\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc . One immediately sees, that the only modification introduced by the\nstring (22) for k = 0 is the replacement of the current J\u03bc\nwith J\u03bc \u2212 C\u03bc . This results in the following change of the\nformula (7):\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\ni\ninv\n(x \u2212 y) = S0 (x \u2212 y) exp \u2212\nS(0)\nd2 ud2 w(J \u03bc (u; x, y) \u2212 C \u03bc (u; x, y))\u25b3\u03bc\u03bd (u \u2212 w)(J \u03bd (w; x, y) \u2212 C \u03bc (w; x, y)) . (27)\n2\nThe evaluating of the exponent leads to the familiar expression [4]:\ninv\nS(0)\n(x \u2212 y) = S0 (x \u2212 y)\n(28)\n#\n\"\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\ng2\n\u03bc\n2 5\n\u03bc\u03b1 z\n2\n2\ndz\u03bc\ndw \u25b3(z \u2212 w) + ig \u03b3\ndw\u03bc (D(z \u2212 y) \u2212 D(z \u2212 x))\u01eb \u2202\u03b1 \u25b3(z \u2212 w) ,\nd z\n\u00d7 exp 2ig \u03b2(x \u2212 y) \u2212 i\n2 \u03b3(x,y) \u03b3(x,y)\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\n\f6\nIn the instanton sectors other than zero, there appear\ncontributions from zero modes of the Dirac operator. We\nagain write the string expression in the source form (22)\nand consider (26) for k = \u00b11. We will not give here\ndetails of this calculation, since it is similar to what was\ndone in [10] and [18] (see formula (37) of the latter). The\nobvious difference now is the replacement of the current\nK\u03bc defined then as:\nK\u03bc (z; x, y) = g\u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bdz D(z \u2212 x) \u2212 g\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u2202\u03bdz D(z \u2212 y)] ,\n(29)\n\nand again satisfying:\n\u2202\u03bcz K\u03bc (z; x, y) = g(\u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 y)) ,\n\n(30)\n\nwith K\u03bc \u2212 C \u03bc . Both currents J \u03bc and K\u03bc have the same\ndivergence, so we again obtain \u2202\u03bcz (K\u03bc \u2212 C \u03bc ) = 0. An\ninspection of the exponent of the formula (37) in [18]\nshows that all 'currents' there become now transverse\nand the longitudinal - i.e. gauge dependent - part of\n\u25b3\u03bc\u03bd does not contribute. The evaluation of the resultant\nexpression gives:\n\n5\n\nige\u03b3E e\u2212i\u03b3 \u03b8\ninv\n(x \u2212 y) =\nS(1)\n4\u03c0 3/2\n\"\n#\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\ng2\n\u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\u03b1 z\n2\n\u00d7 exp \u2212i\ndz\u03bc\ndw \u25b3(z \u2212 w) + ig\ndw\u03bc (D(z \u2212 y) + D(z \u2212 x))\u01eb \u2202\u03b1 \u25b3(z \u2212 w) .\nd z\n2 \u03b3(x,y) \u03b3(x,y)\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nTo find the infrared asymptotics of S inv (x, y), we have\nto consider all terms appearing in the exponents of (28)\nand (31), which are similar, although not identical. Happily, for \u03b3(x, y) being a segment of the straight line, the\nexpressions:\nZ\nZ\ndw\u03bc (D(z \u2212 y) \u00b1 D(z \u2212 x))\u01eb\u03bc\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1z \u25b3(z \u2212 w) (32)\nd2 z\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nturn out to be zero. This may be proved by a direct computation, but can also easily be seen in the following way.\nIf we substitute w\u03bc = (y \u03bc \u2212 x\u03bc )t + x\u03bc (where parameter\nt \u2208 [0, 1]), which means that dw\u03bc = (y \u03bc \u2212x\u03bc )dt, and shift\nthe integration variable z \u03bc \u2192 z \u03bc + x\u03bc , the only vector\nappearing in (32), after executing the z integration, is\ny \u03bc \u2212 x\u03bc . This vector has to saturate Lorentz indices of\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03b1 , so we obtain a factor \u01eb\u03bc\u03b1 (y\u03bc \u2212 x\u03bc )(y\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b1 ) = 0.\nAs regards the first integral in (28) and (31), it may\nbe expressed, for the path in question, by the Meijer's\nfunction G:\nZ\nZ\ndz\u03bc\ndw\u03bc \u25b3(z \u2212 w) =\n(33)\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\ninv\n(x \u2212 y) \u223c\nS(1)\n\nige\u03b3E e\u2212i\u03b3\n(4\u03c0)3/2\n\n5\n\n\u03b8\n\ne\u2212\n\ng\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c0\n\n4\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212(x\u2212y)2\n\n(31)\n\n.\n\nAs we see, both terms decrease exponentially, with the\n4\n, where \u03ba is\nsame euclidean correlation length equal to \u03c0\u03ba\na mass of the Schwinger boson, but with different power\nprefactors. In QED3 such an exponential behavior was\nsuggested to be universal and unavoidable in the infrared,\nfor the gauge invariant propagators defined by the Wilson strings [21]. In the Schwinger Model without instantons, the same result has been obtained in [4]. We have\nnow shown, that this phenomenon appears for k = \u00b11\ntoo. The asymptotic scale invariance is then broken both\nby the exponential factor and by the various powers of\n\u2212(x \u2212 y)2 in different topological sectors. One should remember, however, that fermions in the SM are confined,\nand do not exist as asymptotic particles.\n\nIV.\n\nAMPLITUDE FOR THE DRESSED\nFERMIONS\n\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\n\u0012 2\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n3\ng (x \u2212 y)2\n2\n\u2212\n2 + G2,1\n,\n1,3\n0, 1, 21\n4\u03c0\n\u221a p\nand if (x \u2212 y)2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, it behaves like \u2212i2g \u03c0 \u2212(x \u2212 y)2 .\nThis term is responsible for the significant change of the\ncharacter of the infrared asymptotics: from power decay\nto exponential decay. This refers to all instanton sectors.\nNow we are in a position to write down the full form of\nthe IR terms of the propagator S inv :\n\nThe alternative form of a gauge invariant propagator\nis connected with the amplitude for the dressed fermion\nfields as suggested by Dirac [26]:\n\n2e\u2212\u03b3E S0 (x \u2212 y) \u2212 g\u221a\u03c0 \u221a\u2212(x\u2212y)2\ne 4\n\u2212 y) \u223c\n,\n(\u2212g 2 (x \u2212 y)2 /\u03c0)1/2\n(34)\n\nTo ensure the gauge independence of the dressed field, a\nfunction F\u03bc has to satisfy the relation:\n\ni\u03c0\n= 2\ng\n\ninv\n(x\nS(0)\n\n\u03a8\u0303(x) = e\u2212i\n \u0303\n\u03a8(x)\n= ei\n\nR\n\nR\n\nd2 zF\u03bc (z,x)A\u03bc (z)\n\n\u03a8(x) ,\n(35)\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\n\nd zF\u03bc (z,x)A (z)\n\n\u03a8(x) .\n\n\u2202z\u03bc F\u03bc (z, x) = g\u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 x) .\n\n(36)\n\n\f7\nFor the particular choice:\nZ\nF\u03bc (z, x) = g dw\u03bc \u03b4 (2) (z \u2212 w) ,\n\n(37)\n\n\u03b3(x,\u03b6)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is arbitrary (in this case the field \u03a8\u0303(x) is gauge\nindependent up to the global transformation, because the\ndivergence of F\u03bc has an extra term canceling, however,\nfor bilinears \u03a8\u03a8), one obtains the string version of the\ninvariant propagator (21). Yet, we are free to consider\nother choices, as for instance:\nF\u03bc (z, x) = g\u2202\u03bcz D(z \u2212 x) .\n\n(38)\n\nThe above form of the dressing is of certain importance,\nsince it is closely related with the problem of path dependence in (21). If one wished to construct a string, which\nwould simultaneously be path independent and ensuring\nthe gauge invariance, it should be set up of the longitudinal part of the field A\u03bc only [27]. Such a definition\neliminates the \u03b3 dependence because A\u03bcL constitutes the\ntotal derivative of certain scalar function, and the string\nintegral is expressible through the values at its ends x\nand y. In this way we arrive at certain particular choice\nof F\u03bc (z, x), for:\n#\n\"\nZ\nexp \u2212ig\n\"\n\ndz\u03bc A\u03bcL (z) =\n\n(39)\n\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\n= exp \u2212ig\n\nZ\n\ndz\u03bc\n\u03b3(x,y)\n\nZ\n\n#\n\nd2 w\u2202z\u03bc \u2202\u03bdz D(z \u2212 w)A\u03bd (z) =\n\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n= exp ig d2 w\u2202\u03bdw (D(y \u2212 w) \u2212 D(x \u2212 w))A\u03bd (w) ,\nand this is just, what (38) with (35) mean.2\nIt should be noted here, that our calculation is fully\nnonperturbative and fermions are confined. For such a\nnonperturbative evaluation of the amplitude with dressed\nfields (35) via Feynman path integral we do not need the\nexistence of asymptotic free fields, and the time nonlocality spoken of in [27] is not an obstacle here.\nThe simplest way to calculate the propagator with such\ndressed fields is to replace fermionic source terms in the\ngenerating functional (26) with:\nR 2 z\n\u03bc\n\u03a8(x)eig d z\u2202\u03bc D(z\u2212x)A (z) \u03b7(x) ,\n(40)\nR 2 z\n\u03bc\n\u03b7(x)e\u2212ig d z\u2202\u03bc D(z\u2212x)A (z) \u03a8(x) .\nThis allows us to apply directly the formulas from [18]\nwith obvious modifications only. Assume the following\nform of the gauge field:\nA\u03bc (x) = A(0)\u03bc (x) + \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd b(x) ,\n\n2\n\n(41)\n\nThe choice (38) is also minimal in guaranteeing gauge invariance\nof the fields (35), in this sense, that it is purely longitudinal.\n\nwhere A(0)\u03bc is certain potential restricted to the instanton sector k = 0 and b is the external scalar function, the\nchoice of which is dictated by the topology of the gauge\nfield. In that way, the whole nonzero winding number of\nA\u03bc may be attributed to \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd b, A(0)\u03bc being the trivial\ntopology field. A\u03bc (x) standing in the exponents of (40)\nreduces actually to A(0)\u03bc (x).\nSince (41) constitutes a simple shift we can now easily\npass in (26) from the functional integration over A to that\nover A(0) . It is known that the coupling term g\u03a8 A\n6 (0) \u03a8\nmay be gauged away if we introduce new fermion fields\ndefined by the relations:\nR 2\n\u03bc (0)\n\u03a8(x) = e\u2212ig6 \u2202x d zD(x\u2212z)\u03b3 A\u03bc (z) \u03a8\u2032 (x) ,\n(42)\nR\n\u2032\n(z)\nig\u03b3 \u03bc 6 \u2202x d2 zD(x\u2212z)A(0)\n\u03bc\n.\n\u03a8(x) = \u03a8 (x)e\nThis transformation is an element of U (1)\u2297UA (1) group,\nwhich leaves Lagrangian (4) invariant but the same cannot be told about fermionic measure in (26) [35, 36, 37].\nThis is a reflection of the anomaly present in the model,\nleading to the gauge boson mass generation. The other\neffect of the transformation (42) is the modification of\nthe source terms, which now become:\nR 2 z\n5\n\u03bc\u03bd (0)\n\u03a8(x)eig\u03b3 d z\u2202\u03bc D(z\u2212x)\u01eb A\u03bd (z) \u03b7(x) ,\n(43)\nR\nz\nig\u03b3 5 d2 z\u2202\u03bc\nD(z\u2212x)\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd A(0)\n(z)\n\u03bd\n\u03b7(x)e\n\u03a8(x) .\n\nThe alteration of the above expressions is the only difference as compared to [18]. This allows us to skip most of\nthe calculations. In the k = 0 sector the effect of (43) is\nto replace J \u03bc in (7) with its transverse part:\nJ \u03bc (z; x, y) \u2192 JT\u03bc (z; x, y)\n=\n\ng\u03b3 5 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bdz [D(z\n\n(44)\n\u2212 x) \u2212 D(z \u2212 y)] .\n\nThe whole procedure becomes then equivalent to taking \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd in the Landau gauge. It turns out, that the\nsame happens also for nontrivial topological sectors. For\nk = \u00b11, the starting point will be the formula (37) in [18].\nIf we recall that both currents J \u03bc and K\u03bc have the same\ndivergence, i.e. the same longitudinal parts, we immediately see that the transformations (43) turn K\u03bc into\nKT\u03bc :\nK\u03bc (z; x, y) \u2192 KT\u03bc (z; x, y)\n=\n\n\u2212g\u03b3 5 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bdz [D(z\n\n(45)\n\u2212 x) + D(z \u2212 y)] .\n\nThe other term multiplying \u25b3\u03bc\u03bd in the exponent of the\nquoted formula (37) of [18] is already transverse, so again\nthe whole story reduces to the choosing of the Landau\ngauge. We conclude then, that the whole propagator and,\nnaturally, its infrared asymptotics is the same as found\nin section II A and, after all, the anomalous dimensions\nfound in (12) and (14) turn out to have some meaning.\n\n\f8\nFor the choice of F \u03bc other than (38) one would have\nto do with the following substitutions:\nJ \u03bc (z; x, y) \u2192 J \u03bc (z; x, y) \u2212 F \u03bc (z, x) + F \u03bc (z, y) ,\n(46)\nK\u03bc (z; x, y) \u2192 K\u03bc (z; x, y) \u2212 F \u03bc (z, x) + F \u03bc (z, y) .\nIt should be emphasized, that these new currents are still\ntransverse, although in general other than those given\nby (44) and (45), so again only \u25b3T\u03bc\u03bd contributes. Thus,\nthe neglecting of \u25b3L\n\u03bc\u03bd is universal for all fields (35), but\nthe transverse contribution is F dependent.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this section we would like to summarize the obtained\nresults. The solvability of the Schwinger Model allows us\nto find the infrared behavior and anomalous dimensions\nfor the fermion Green's functions in all instanton sectors.\nIn the case of an ordinary, gauge dependent propagator,\nthe IR anomalous dimension equals to \u22121/2 when we\nchoose the Landau gauge or \u03be/2 \u2212 1/2 for the R\u03be gauge.\nThe value of this exponent is independent on the topological sector and may be simply put to zero, if one chooses\n\u03be = 1.\nThe gauge independent propagator may be defined in\ntwo possible ways: either by the string ansatz adopted\nfrom Schwinger or as an amplitude of the dressed\nfermions suggested by Dirac. In the first case, the correlation function becomes path dependent. For the simplest case of a straight line it may be found explicitly.\nOne observes then, the essential change of the infrared\nasymptotics: the suppression of the fermion propagator\nis no longer algebraic but becomes exponential, with the\ncorrelation length being proportional to the inverse of the\nmass of the fermionic bound state - the Schwinger boson. This phenomenon appears in all instanton sectors,\ndiffering only in algebraic prefactors. The k = 0 contribution decays slightly faster than that for k = \u00b11, which\n\n[1] J.

For\nthe dressing chosen in section IV, which is equivalent to\nconstructing the string of the longitudinal part of the\ngauge field only, we find the propagator to be identical\nto the gauge variant one calculated in the Landau gauge.\nThis again refers to all instanton sectors.\nUndoubtedly, the principal question to be answered is\nthe proper definition of the invariant propagator. In general this definition will probably be not unique, but there\nshould be certain prescriptions for the specific cases. For\nthe 'string' propagator the following questions, worth being answered, arise. Firstly, it would be interesting to\ncalculate propagator for paths \u03b3 other than the segment\nof the straight line and find whether infrared behavior is\nsensible to that choice. Secondly, on might think about a\nsystematic study of the possible connection between the\nfixing of a gauge in the variant function and the choice\nof a specific path in the invariant one. Some work in\nthis direction was done in [38]. Thirdly, one might ask,\nwhether there are any physical reasons for the choice of\nthe particular path \u03b3 as more convenient than another.\nAs higher functions can also be found explicitly\nin the Schwinger Model in all topological sectors, it\nwould be interesting to construct the two-fermion (i.e.\nfour-point) Green's function in a gauge-invariant way,\nand investigate both its infrared anomalous dimensions\nand analytical properties. This analysis my be the\nmore interesting, that this function contains a bound\nstate singularity, the character of which varies between\ntopological sectors.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank to Professor J\u00f3zef Namyslowski\nfor interesting discussions.\n\n[7] K.G.
