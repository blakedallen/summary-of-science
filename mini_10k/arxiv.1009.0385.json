Introduction\nThe exceptional divisor of a resolution of a singularity of a normal surface is a connected\ncurve. The set of positive divisors supported on this exceptional divisor satisfying some negativity condition forms a semigroup, called the semigroup of Lipman in reference to his work\n[13]. The unique smallest element of this semigroup characterizes the class of the singularity;\nfor example, if the geometric genus of the smallest element is zero then the singularity is called\nrational [3]. When the singularity is rational, the elements of the semigroup of Lipman are in\none-to-one correspondence with the functions in the local ring at the singularity. These elements are important to understand algebraic and topological structure of the corresponding\nsingularity, see [6, 14, 15].\nThe smallest element of the semigroup of Lipman is calculated by the Laufer algorithm\n(see [12, 4.1]) and all the other elements are computed by the algorithms given in [16, 18].\nThe natural question of determining an explicit finite generating set for the semigroup is\nanswered in [1]. The authors use the tools from toric geometry to compute all the generators\nby means of the generators of certain ring of invariants. Their method is effective but it is\ndifficult to follow for an exceptional divisor with many components.\nHere we present an easier combinatorial method to obtain the set of generators of the\nsemigroup of Lipman. More significantly, we describe another semigroup associated to an\nexceptional divisor whose Hilbert basis, which can be computed directly from the intersection\nmatrix of the exceptional divisor, gives exactly the generators of the Lipman semigroup and\nthe corresponding ring of invariants at the same time. The latter is important for a deeper\nstudy of properties of the associated toric variety, such as being a set-theoretic complete\nintersection [2] or having a nice Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity [8].\n\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section, we recall some terminology and results which will be used later without any\nreference. Let Y be a normal surface with an isolated singularity at 0 and (X, E) \u2192 (Y, 0)\nbe a resolution of singularities with an exceptional curve E over 0. Let E1 , . . . , En be the\nDate: November 8, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The set of divisors supported on E forms a lattice defined by\nM := {m1 E1 + * * * + mn En | mi \u2208 Z}.\nThere is an additive subsemigroup of M which is referred to as the Lipman semigroup and\nis defined by\nE := {D \u2208 M | D * Ei \u2264 0, for any i = 1, . . . , n} .\nIt follows that if m1 E1 + * * * + mn En \u2208 E\\{0} then mi > 0, for all i = 1, . . . , n, see [3]. By\ndefinition, D \u2208 E if and only if D * Ei = \u2212di for some di \u2208 N and for all i = 1, . . . , n. Denote\nby M (E) the intersection matrix of the exceptional divisor E, that is, a matrix with integral\nentries defined by the intersection multiplicities Ei * Ej . It is known that M (E) is negative\ndefinite.\nGiven D = m1 E1 + * * * + mn En \u2208 M , with mi > 0. The following equivalence determines\nthe elements of E\n(2.1)\n\nD * Ei = \u2212di \u21d4 M (E)[ m1 * * * mn ]T = \u2212[ d1 * * * dn ]T .\n\nIf ei = [ 0 * * * 1 * * * 0 ]T is the standard basis element of the space of column matrices of\nsize n, then every column matrix \u2212[ d1 * * * dn ]T , with all di \u2265 0, is spanned by \u2212e1 , . . . , \u2212en .\nHence, it follows that the rational cone over E is generated by the Fi which is defined to be the\n(rational) solution of the matrix equation above corresponding to \u2212ei for each i. Therefore,\nwe can write Fi as follows:\nFi =\n\nn\nX\naij\nj=1\n\nbij\n\nEj ,\n\nwhere aij and bij are relatively prime integers. Now, let gi be the least common factor of\nbi1 , . . . , bin so that gi Fi is the smallest multiple of Fi that belongs to E. Denote by M \u2032 the\nlattice generated by F1 , . . . , Fn and let N , N \u2032 be the corresponding dual lattices of M , M \u2032\nrespectively. Then, N \u2032 is a sublattice of N of finite index, since M is a sublattice of M \u2032 .\nDenote by \u03c3\u030c the cone in MR := M \u2297Z R spanned by the semigroup E. The semigroup\n\u03c3\u030c \u2229 M \u2287 E is called the saturation of E and the semigroup E itself is called saturated (or\nnormal) if \u03c3\u030c \u2229 M \u2286 E as well.\nProposition 2.1. E is a pointed, saturated semigroup which is also simplicial and finitely\ngenerated.\nProof. If D \u2208 E, then D *Ei \u2264 0 which forces that \u2212D *Ei \u2265 0. This means that D \u2208 E \u2229(\u2212E)\nif and only if D = 0, which proves that E is pointed.\nNow, take D \u2208 \u03c3\u030c \u2229 M , i.e. D = mD \u2032 , for some D \u2032 \u2208 E and m > 0. Since D \u2032 \u2208 E, we have\nD \u2032 * Ei \u2264 0 which yields immediately that D * Ei = mD \u2032 * Ei \u2264 0. Therefore, D must belong\nto E which reveals that E is saturated.\nSince E is saturated it follows that E = \u03c3\u030c \u2229 M and thus \u03c3\u030c is generated by n = dim \u03c3\u030c =\nrank M linearly independent elements F1 , . . . , Fn over Q+ , which means that \u03c3\u030c is a maximal\nand simplicial strongly convex rational polyhedral cone. This shows that E is simplicial.\nThat E has a unique finite minimal generating set HE over N follows directly from [17,\nLemma 13.1].\n\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 2.2. The unique minimal generating set HE of E over N is called the Hilbert basis\nof E.\n\n\fHILBERT BASIS OF THE LIPMAN SEMIGROUP\n\n3\n\nSince E is saturated, we can associate a normal toric variety VE := Spec C[E] to E, see [7]\nfor details. It turns out that the coordinate ring C[E] of this variety is nothing but the ring\nof invariants of C[M \u2032 ] under the natural action of N/N \u2032 , see [1, Proposition 3.4].\nRemark 2.3. VE is isomorphic to the geometric quotient Ck /G in the language of the Geometric Invariant Theory, since G = N/N \u2032 is a finite group and E is simplicial. Hence, VE has\nonly quotient singularities.\n3. Main Results\nRecall that the unique minimal generating set HS of a pointed, saturated semigroup S is\ncalled the Hilbert basis of S, see [17]. We first associate to E the obvious subsemigroup of\nNn ;\nS1 := {(m1 , . . . , mn ) \u2208 Nn | m1 E1 + * * * + mn En \u2208 E}.\nProposition 3.1. \u03c61 : E \u2192 S1 is an isomorphism, where \u03c61 (m1 E1 + * * * + mn En ) =\n(m1 , . . . , mn ).\n\n\u0003\n\nSimilarly, we can associate another subsemigroup S2 of Nn with the semigroup E as follows:\nS2 := {(d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 Nn | di = \u2212(D * Ei ), for some D \u2208 E and for all i = 1, . . . , n}.\nProposition 3.2. S2 and E are isomorphic as semigroups. Moreover, the Hilbert basis of S2\ndetermines the parametrization of the toric variety VE .\nProof. Define \u03c62 : E \u2192 S2 by \u03c62 (D) = (\u2212D * E1 , . . . , \u2212D * En ), for each D \u2208 E. This defines\nclearly a homomorphism between the semigroups, since we have\n(D + D \u2032 ) * Ei = D * Ei + D \u2032 * Ei ,\n\nfor any\n\ni = 1, . . . , n.\n\nSurjectivity follows from the Equation 1 together with M (E) being invertible over the\nrationals. Indeed, for a given (d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 S2 there are non-negative rational numbers m\u2032i\nsuch that [ m\u20321 * * * m\u2032n ]T = \u2212(M (E))\u22121 [ d1 * * * dn ]T . Multiplying m\u2032i by the least common\nfactor of the positive integers in the denominators of m\u2032i , we get non-negative integers mi\nsuch that \u03c62 (D) = (d1 , . . . , dn ), where D = m1 E1 + * * * + mn En \u2208 E. The injectivity follows\nsimilarly.\nWe prove the second part now. Since C[E] and C[S2 ] are isomorphic from the first part, VS2\nis an embedding of VE = Spec C[E] in some affine space. It is known that C[S2 ] is generated\nminimally by the monomials ud11 * * * udnn which is determined by (d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 HS2 . Therefore\nwe need to determine the elements of HS2 more precisely. Since S2 is a subsemigroup of Nn\nand \u03c62 (gi Fi ) = gi ei is the smallest element of S2 on the i-th ray of the cone \u03c62 (\u03c3\u030c), it follows\nthat HS2 contains gi ei , for each i = 1, . . . , n. If we denote by hj = hj1 e1 + * * * + hjn en the\nother elements of the Hilbert basis of S2 , then it follows from [10, Corollary 2] that the toric\nvariety VS2 is parametrized by the toric set\n\u0393(S2 ) = {(ug11 , . . . , ugnn , uh1 11 * * * uhn1n , . . . , uh1 k1 * * * uhnkn ) | u1 , . . . , un \u2208 C}.\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nMESUT \u015eAH\u0130N\n\nIn order to state our main result, let A = [M (E)|In ] be the n \u00d7 2n integer matrix obtained\nby joining the intersection matrix M (E) of the exceptional divisor E and the identity matrix\nof size n \u00d7 n. Then, we define the last semigroup as\nS = {(v1 , . . . , v2n ) \u2208 N2n A * [v1 * * * v2n ]T = 0}.\nHere is the nice relation between the three semigroups defined so far.\n\u22121\n\u22121\nTheorem 3.3. S = S1 \u00d7E S2 := {(x, y) \u2208 S1 \u00d7 S2 | \u03c6\u22121\n: Si \u2192 E\n1 (x) = \u03c62 (y)} where \u03c6i\n\nare the isomorphisms introduced in Propositions 2 and 3.\nProof. The following observations can be seen immediately.\n(v1 , . . . , v2n ) \u2208 S \u21d4 A * [v1 * * * v2n ]T = 0 \u21d4 M (E) * [v1 * * * vn ]T = \u2212[vn+1 * * * v2n ]T\n\u21d4 D = v1 E1 + * * * + vn En \u2208 E\n\nand D * Ei = \u2212vn+i , for any i = 1, . . . , n\n\n\u21d4 (v1 , . . . , vn , vn+1 , . . . , v2n ) \u2208 S1 \u00d7E S2 .\nTherefore, the proof is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe Hilbert basis of this last semigroup is easy to find and gives important information\nabout the others as we see now.\nCorollary 3.4. Hilbert basis of S gives the generators of the Lipman semigroup and the\nparametrization of the corresponding toric variety at the same time.\nProof. By Theorem 3.3, it follows that the elements of HS is in bijection with the elements\nof HS1 and HS2 . Hence, (m1 , . . . , mn , d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 HS if and only if (m1 , . . . , mn ) \u2208 HS1\nand (d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 HS2 . Now, it is clear from Proposition 3.1 that (m1 , . . . , mn ) \u2208 HS1 if and\nonly if m1 E1 + * * * + mn En \u2208 HE . On the other hand, we know from the proof of Proposition\n3.2 that HS2 determines the parametrization of the toric variety associated to E.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.5. Our main Theorem 3.3 gives rise to an algorithm which starts with the intersection matrix M (E) and computes the Hilbert basis HE of the Lipman semigroup and the\nparametrization of the toric variety VE at once. It uses existing algorithms for computing\nHilbert basis of lattice points of cones, where the lattice is given by the kernel of an integral\nmatrix A, see [9] and references therein or [11, Chapter 6].\nWe conclude the paper with an illustration of our user-friendly combinatorial method.\nExample 3.6. Consider\n\"\n# the exceptional divisor E over a singularity of A2 -type. Then A =\n\u22122\n1 1 0\n.\n1 \u22122 0 1\nA computation with a computer package (e.g. CoCoA [4] or 4ti2 [5]) gives the Hilbert\nbasis of S to be the set\nHS = {(2, 1, 3, 0), (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0, 3)}.\nThis says that HE = {2E1 + E2 , E1 + E2 , E1 + 2E2 } and the smallest element E1 + E2 is the\nfundamental cycle of E. Since HS2 = {(3, 0), (1, 1), (0, 3)}, it also says that the corresponding\ntoric variety VE is parametrized by the toric set \u0393(S2 ) = {(u31 , u1 u2 , u32 ) | u1 , u2 \u2208 C}.\n\n\fHILBERT BASIS OF THE LIPMAN SEMIGROUP\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe paper has been written while the author was visiting the Abdus Salam International\nCentre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy.
