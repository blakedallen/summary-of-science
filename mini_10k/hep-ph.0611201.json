Here I described development of electron-positron\ncolliding beam project in INP, as well as advance of similar projects of the\nfirst generation at LAL, Orsay and at LNF, Frascati.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the mid of 50's of last century electron accelerators of higher and higher energy\nwere built, while their usefulness was limited by the fact the energy available for\nphysics study, e.g. for analysis of interaction at small distances or for creating of\nnew particles, is that measured in the center-of-mass system (c.m.s.) of\u221atarget and\nincident electron. In the relativistic limit the energy in c.m.s. is \u03b5c = 2\u03b5l mc2 /2,\nwhere \u03b5l is the electron energy in the laboratory system, m is the mass of target. In\nelectron-electron interaction for \u03b5l =6 GeV (the highest electron energy planned at\nthat time) one has only \u03b5c =39 MeV. Because of this reason a new idea appeared:\nto create storage rings where two electron beams (or two proton beams) traveling\nin opposite directions could collide. The colliding beams idea was proposed nearly\nsimultaneously in 1956 [1], [2] and actively discussed at 1956 CERN Accelerator\nSymposium. After several laboratories started serious R@D and design activity.\nSLAC proposal to study limits of quantum electrodynamics was issued in May 1958\n[3].\nAfter completing my post-graduated courses at Moscow Lebedev Institute at\nJanuary 1959 I joined newly organized Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) of Siberian\nBranch of Academy of Science of USSR1 . Professor G.I.Budker was appointed di1\nDecision of Soviet Government about creation of the new large Scientific Center near Novosibirsk devoted to development of Siberia was issued May 18, 1957. Formal decision about creation\nNuclear Physics Institute was issued February 21, 1958.\n\n1\n\n\frector of the institute. This was 40-years ambitious physicist working on fairly nonstandard problems of plasma and accelerator physics. The institute was formed on\nthe basis of small Budker's laboratory \"New acceleration methods\" at Nuclear Energy Institute (now Kurchatov Institute) in Moscow. At the end of 1958 scientific\nstaff of Institute was consisted of around 30 persons most of them were graduated\nstudents. The very new idea of electron-electron colliding beams, for realization of\nwhich many original development were needed, attracted Budkers's attention and\ncreation of electron-electron colliding beam facility became one of main purposes\nof newly created institute.\nIn 1959 the colliding beams team worked on technical design of facility including\nsome specific issues such as fast injection kicker magnets, ultra-high vacuum system,\ndetector of scattered electrons, etc. At the same time the program of physics\nresearch was under development. Budker seek for support of colliding beams project\nand invited known scientists to discuss the research program. In October 1959\nI.Ya.Pomeranchuk visited institute. In Budker's office it was quite long discussion of\nelectron-electron colliding beams facility where study of quantum electrodynamics\nat small distances was mixed with technical details of installation, which was at\nvery beginning of construction. Pomeranchuk was not in raptures concerning the\ndiscussion and no support to the project was expressed. Besides other participants\nof the meeting did not express any enthusiasm. After Pomeranchuk left institute,\nBudker came to my office, he was complaining that institute research program is not\nenough impressive and one has to think how improve it. I replied that the program\nbecomes immeasurably more rich, if one creates electron-positron colliding beams.\n\"You are mad!\" said Budker and left. But several minutes later he arrived back:\n\"Tell me once more!\" In very intense discussion which followed we expressed many\ntimes the pros and cons realization of electron-positron colliding beams. In the\nend, late in the evening, Budker demanded that I had to lay aside all my business\nand concentrate on realization of new proposal. It was October 28, 1959.\nThe next day active work began. We considered the electron-positron colliding\nbeams installation step by step from morning to late evening. Within a week\nthe very rough draft of facility which later became VEPP-2 was prepared. The\nmaximal energy per beam (700 MeV) was selected to produce K-mesons. Special\nattention was devoted to positron production by electrons in tungsten converter.\nThe first design drawing of electron-positron facility were made in December 1959.\nIt should be noted that at that time all electron-electron colliding beam projects\nwere on the very preliminary stage.\nThe research program which was formulated at that time was [4]:\n1. Study of elastic electron-positron scattering at large angle to test QED at\nsmall distances (similar to a goal of electron-electron colliding beams).\n2. Study of annihilation electron-positron pair into two photons. This is an\nadditional test of QED.\n\n2\n\n\f3. Study of conversion of e+ e\u2212 pair into pair of \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 mesons. This is a\ntest if the \u03bc meson is pointlike and if so this is an additional channel to test\nQED.\n4. Study of conversion of e+ e\u2212 pair into pair of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 mesons to study the\nelectromagnetic form-factor of pion at time-like momentum transfer.\n5. Study of conversion of e+ e\u2212 pair into pair of K + and K \u2212 mesons to study\nthe electromagnetic form-factor of kaon at time-like momentum transfer.\nIt is reasonable to describe the scene in elementary physics research at that\ntime. A few electron synchrotrons with energy slightly higher than 1 GeV were\nbrought into operation in middle of 50's, so the experience of work with such accelerators was quite limited. The table of elementary particles contained leptons:\nelectron, positron, neutrino, antineutrino, \u03bc\u00b1 meson; and strongly-interacting particles: proton, neutron, a few types of hyperons, as well as \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03c0 0 mesons and\ndifferent types of K mesons.\nIt is evident, that electron-positron colliding beams could give very new opportunities not only for test of QED at small distances but also for study of electromagnetic properties of mesons participating in strong interaction. At that time\nthere was no information at all about these properties. Even the cross section of\nsuch simple process as transformation of electron-positron pair onto pair of \u03bc+ and\n\u03bc\u2212 mesons was calculated by Berestetsky and Pomeranchuk only in 1955 [5].\nHow to realize electron-positron facility was the question. First of all it was\nnecessary to develop positron production system. Positrons (antiparticles) were\nobserved in cosmic rays and in reaction at accelerators. However considerable\namount of positrons was never produced. In the 30's-40's the theory of electronphoton showers was developed. This was a basement. But for electron-positron\nfacility one has to produce beam of positrons. The elaborated scheme of positron\nproduction is used now everywhere, naturally with many perfection: the electron\nbeam with energy a few hundreds MeV is directed to heavy metal (e.g. tungsten)\ntarget with thickness 1-2 radiation length. In the target electron radiate a photon in\ncollision with a nucleus, then this photon interacts with another nucleus and creates\nelectron-positron pair. Created positrons should be collected and accelerated and\nthen injected to storage ring. We started calculation of conversion of electrons into\npositrons nearly from the very beginning of project. The good peace of this work\nwas done by Synakh [6] (at that time my post-graduated student). For example,\nthe calculated conversion coefficient \u03bc of electrons with energy \u03b50 = 500 MeV\ninto positrons with energy \u03b5 = 250 MeV into the energy interval \u2206\u03b5/\u03b5 \u223c 5% is\n\u03bc \u2243 1/400 for the converter with thickness around 1 radiation length. The created\npositrons are moving mostly ahead in the direction of electron momentum. In the\nmentioned example the angle of positron cone is \u223c 4\u25e6 . So, other things being equal,\nfor production of positron beam of some intensity one needs the electron beam\n\n3\n\n\fwhich is thousand more intense. If one accumulates positrons by small bunches,\nthen the storage time will be thousand times longer.\nA few graduated student were recruited to the team which started the development of electron-positron facility. They began more detail study of the project\nincluding electron injector, ejection from it using the fast kicker magnets, channels and conversion of electrons into positrons in one of channels, injection into\nsole storage ring where electrons and positrons are moving in opposite directions,\nultra-high vacuum system in storage ring and stability of orbits in it.\nAt that time (end of 1959) the electron-electron colliding beam projects were\nonly at very preliminary stage of development and some people doubted that the\ncolliding beam technology could be used in high-energy physics research. In this\nsituation the proposal to build the electron-positron facility with essentially higher\nrequirements for intensity and quality of beams was coldly received by many famous\nmembers of Soviet Academy of Science. Only support of I.V.Kurchatov at that time\nvery influential director of Nuclear Energy Institute permitted to start development\nof the project. Another factor which lowered level of opposition to the project was\ntransfer of the all team from Moscow to the wild East: to Novosibirsk, where\nbuilding of edifices of Nuclear Physics Institute began in 1959.\nIn 1960 when the staff was still very small all members of the team were working on various topics of both electron-electron and electron-positron installations.\nAlexander Skrinsky was appointed as a head of laboratory. I have found not long\nago the internal report of INP-1960 with a title \"Motion of particles in an accelerator with racetrack\" by V.N.Baier, V.S.Synakh and I.B.Khriplovich devoted to\nstudy of particle dynamics in VEPP-2.\nIn 1961 the main part of staff (including Budker, Skrinsky and myself) was\nmoved from Moscow to the new Academic town (Academgorodok) in 30 km south\nfrom Novosibirsk, where the first building of INP was constructed. Evidently, transfer of the team with equipment was an obstacle in the way of project development.\nHowever, it was quite good financial support of the new Institute in Novosibirsk\nand this permitted to create quite effective Institute's workshop for manufacturing\nof parts of the facility, and to order most big parts in Novosibirsk industry from\nthe one side, and to recruit many graduated students from Novosibirsk universities\nfrom the other side.\nIn the beginning of 1961 our library received Il Nouvo Cimento with announcement about Frascati storage ring [7]. This showed that we were not alone in the\nfield2 . But from point of view of our experience at that time it was evident (we are\nworked hard at injection system and creation of positron beam) that at best the\nvery limited amount of electrons and (or) positrons could be stored in storage ring\nwithout direct particle injection.\nIn 1962 some parts of VEPP-2 were ready and tested. The storage ring VEP-1\nmanufactured at big Novosibirsk factory was first moved in 1961 to the Kurchatov\n2\n\nContacts with foreign laboratories were so limited at that time, that the scientific information\none drew only from journals.\n\n4\n\n\fInstitute in Moscow, then in summer of 1962 it was disassembled together with\nsynchrotron B-2S which was its injector and moved to INP in Novosibirsk where\nboth was assembled fast and immediately the test operations began.\nIn the year 1963 it was permitted the complete legalization of activity of INP3 .\nAt the International Conference on high-energy accelerators in Dubna in August\n1963 the collider activity of INP was presented for the first time [8]. The photo of\nVEPP-2 assembly process was contained in the report along with other information.\nThe main contributors are the authors of the corresponding parts.\nBefore the Conference we got information that the Frascati storage ring AdA\nmoved from Frascati to Orsay, where there was the high-energy linac which was\nused as an injector. The new interesting effect was observed: the loss of particles\nin storage ring due to electron-electron scattering inside the bunch [9]. Under some\nconditions the lifetime of a beam in a storage ring is determined just by this event\nwhich is now called the Touschek effect.\nWe have learned at the Conference that two more teams started the work in\nthe same direction. These were the projects of Orsay electron-positron storage\nring ACO with energy up to 450 MeV at Laboratoire de l'Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur Lin\u00e9aire\n(LAL) in Orsay, France [10] and electron-positron storage ring ADONE with energy\nup to 1.5 GeV at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) in Frascati, Italy [12].\nSomewhat later we received description of ACO in detail [11].\nThis indicated that creation of electron-positron colliders became very respectable\nand perspective direction of development of high-energy accelerators. Some kind\nof race emerged for the physics meaningful results at these colliders.\nThe study of electron-electron scattering at VEP-1 storage ring began in 1964.\nThe first small angle scattering event was registered on May 19.\nA very important characteristics of colliding beam facility is the luminosity L.\nThe number of events per unit time (usually 1 sec) N of some process with the\ntotal cross section \u03c3 is N = L\u03c3. The luminosity is proportional to product of\ncurrent in the beams and inverse proportional to the transverse section of beam S.\nTo obtain acceptable luminosity one has to work with enough high currents and\nsmall size beams. A very high vacuum and damping of beam instabilities are the\nnecessary conditions to have reasonable small beam size.\nA new type of sophisticated detectors had to be created. Ben Sidorov was in\ncharge of this direction in INP.\nThe data taking at VEPP-2 installation began in 1966 [13]. The results will be\ndiscussed below.\n3\n\nBecause of pathological secrecy adopted at that time in USSR, all activity in Kurchatov\nInstitute was considered as \"for restricted use only\" and the special permission for publication in\nopen journals or proceedings was necessary for each article.\n\n5\n\n\f2\n\nPhysics with electron-positron colliding beams\n\n2.1\n\nRadiative corrections\n\nOn the first stage of the electron-positron project development one of main goals\nwas the check of the applicability of quantum electrodynamics at small distances.\nThe qualitative estimate of measured distance4 is \u03bb \u223c 1/q = (h\u0304/q), where q is the\nmomentum transfer. For q \u223c 1 GeV the measured distance is \u03bb \u223c 0.2 fm\n(1 fm=10\u221213 cm is a typical hadron scale).\nThe cross sections of electron-electron and electron-positron scattering in Born\napproximation (order \u03b12 ) was calculated by M\u00f8ller and Bhabha in 30's. The fantastic development of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in 40's permitted consideration of higher order corrections (the series with respect to powers \u03b1 = e2 )\nwhich are called radiative corrections(RC). In the late 50's these corrections to the\nmentioned cross sections were the topic of QED textbook (e.g. [14, 15]). At high\nenergy \u03b5 \u226b m the actual parameter of decomposition is (\u03b1/\u03c0) ln(\u03b5/m). Calculation of RC includes obligatory (because of infrared divergence) contribution from\nradiation of real photons and because of this depends on the particular experimental set-up. In the specific conditions of binary (2 \u2192 2) reactions on colliding beams\nthe photon emission from one of initial particles causes non-collinearity of the final particle momenta \u2206\u03b8. Since for elastic cross section the events with minimal\n\u2206\u03b8 are selected, this imposes substantial limitation on energy \u2206\u03b5 radiated from\nthe initial particles. Accuracy of measurement of final particles energy in the 1st\ngeneration detector was quite poor. This means that hard photon emission from\nfinal particles are allowed and this complicates calculation. The cross section with\nthe radiative corrections \u03b4R taken into account are usually written in the form:\nd\u03c3 = d\u03c30 (1 \u2212 \u03b4R ), where d\u03c30 is the M\u00f8ller (or Bhabha) cross section. The main\nterm of RC of the lowest order \u221d \u03b13 (so-called \"double-logarithm term\" containing\nthe product of two large logarithm: logarithm of energy and logarithm of ratio\n\u2206\u03b5/\u03b5, which arises from sum of contributions of soft virtual and real photons) is\n\u03b4R = (8\u03b1/\u03c0) ln(\u03b5/m) ln \u03b5/\u2206\u03b5), where \u2206\u03b5 is the total energy of emitted quanta.\nThe different aspects of radiative effects in electron-electron (positron) collisions\nwere analyzed with Sam Kheifets, Victor Fadin and Valery Khoze. The complete\nexpressions for \u03b4R in e \u2212 e scattering are given in [16, 17] and in e+ \u2212 e\u2212 scattering\nin [18].\nFor typical experimental conditions at \u03b5 \u223c 1 GeV one has the radiative correction \u03b4R \u223c 10% and evidently it should be taken into account in comparison of\ntheory and data.\nAt high energies and for \u2206\u03b5/\u03b5 \u226a 1 the soft-photon corrections dominate, e.g.\nfor \u03b5 = 7 GeV and \u2206\u03b5/\u03b5 = 10\u22122 one has \u03b4R = 0.75, and one can't be restricted to\nthe lowest order of perturbation theory. So the general analysis of RC in the all\norders of perturbation theory is of significant interest. In the 50's it was fashionable\n4\n\nBelow the system of units where h\u0304 = c = 1 is used.\n\n6\n\n\fto study structure of QED as a whole. The method of calculation of the cross sections in high energy QED proposed by Abrikosov [19] was used. Within framework\nof this method, only those contributions are retained which contain the maximum\npower of the large logarithms. For test of QED at small distances only processes\nwith large momentum transfer are of interest. It's remarkable that in this case in\nany order of the perturbation theory only contributions of diagrams with one photon exchange between charged particle lines survives, while all other contributions\ncancel each other, and in double-logarithm approximation the scattering cross section after inclusion of soft photon emission acquires the form d\u03c3(\u03b8) = d\u03c30 (\u03b8)e\u2212\u03b4R\n[20, 21]. It was shown that in double-logarithm approximation the cross sections\nof all processes of scattering and pair creation for large momentum transfers have\nsoft-photon nature (see [20, 21, 22]). As it was mentioned, only diagrams with one\nphoton exchange between charged particles contribute. An interesting application\nis the behavior of e\u2212 + e+ \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + \u03bc+ cross section near threshold. In the case when\nthere is no limitation on photon emission \u03b4R \u2192 \u03b4\u03bc = (4\u03b1/\u03c0) ln(\u03b5/(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03bc)) ln(\u03b5/m),\nwhere \u03bc is the muon mass. For nonrelativistic muons one has [21]\nq\n\u03c3(\u03b8) = \u03c30 (\u03b8) \u221a\n2\u03b5\u03bc\n\n! 8\u03b1 ln\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b5\nm\n\n|\u03c8(0)|2 ,\n\n\u03b12 q\n\u03bc2 q 2\n\u03c30 (\u03b8) =\n1\n+\n+ 2 cos2 \u03b8 ,\n16\u03b53\n\u03b52\n\u03b5\n\"\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is the momentum of final muon and \u03b8 is the angle between momenta\nof initial electron and final \u03bc\u2212 , factor |\u03c8(0)|2 takes into account the Coulomb\ninteraction between final particles found by Sakharov [23]: |\u03c8(0)|2 = (2\u03c0\u03b1/v)/(1 \u2212\ne\u22122\u03c0\u03b1/v ), here v is the muon velocity. In the region where the Coulomb interaction\nis insignificant (2\u03c0\u03b1/v \u226b 1) one obtains \u03c3 \u221d q 1.1 in place of \u03c3 \u221d q; and for \u03c4 -lepton\n\u03c3 \u221d q 1.15 .\nThe test of the applicability of QED at small distances by electron-electron scattering was performed at VEP-1 storage ring in Novosibirsk [26] and at PrincetonStanford storage ring [25], [27]. The data [25], [27] have been compared with the\nM\u00f8ller formula modified by a form factor f (q 2) (in vertex \u03b3\u03bc \u2192 \u03b3\u03bc f (q 2 ) and 1/q 2 \u2192\nf (q 2 )/q 2 ) and usually a simple parametrization is used5 f 2 (q 2 ) = 1/(1 \u00b1 q 2 /\u039b2\u00b1 )\nand with radiative correction \u03b4R , calculated by Tsai [28, 29], taken into account.\nThe limit \u039b = \u221e corresponds to interaction of point particles. The results of experiment [27] are \u039b\u2212 > 4.4 GeV and \u039b+ > 2.7 GeV (95% confidence). The limit\n\u039b\u2212 > 4.4 GeV means that QED was checked for distance l \u2265 0.05 fm. The distance\nl is much shorter than characteristic hadronic dimension.\nSimilar limitations where obtained for different processes at electron-positron\ncolliders of the first generation (95% confidence):\n1. Electron-positron elastic scattering measured in Orsay (ACO collider) with\nbeam energy \u03b5 = 510 MeV [30] with RC \u03b4R \u223c 7% results \u039b\u2212 > 3.8 GeV and\n\u039b+ > 2.8 GeV and measured in Frascati (Adone collider) with beam energy\n\u03b5 = 700 \u2212 1200 MeV [31] gives \u039b\u00b1 > 6 GeV.\n5\n\nFor more general modification see [24]\n\n7\n\n\f2. Two-photon annihilation of electron-positron pair measured on VEPP-2 collider in Novosibirsk with beam energy \u03b5 = 500 MeV [32] results \u039b\u00b1 > 1.3 GeV\nand measured in Frascati (Adone collider) with beam energy \u03b5 = 700 \u2212\n1200 MeV [31] gives \u039b\u2212 > 2.0 GeV and \u039b+ > 2.6 GeV. In this reaction both\nthe modifications of vertex and of electron propagator in a consistent (gauge\ninvariant) way were introduced.\n3. Study of conversion of e+ e\u2212 pair into pair of \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 mesons on VEPP2 collider in Novosibirsk with beam energy \u03b5 = 500 MeV [33] gives \u039b\u00b1 >\n3.1 GeV (95% confidence) and measured in Frascati (Adone collider) with\nbeam energy \u03b5 = 700 \u2212 1200 MeV [31] gives \u039b\u2212 > 5 GeV.\nThe tests of QED at small distances were continued at next generations of\nelectron-positron colliders, which were built later in Novosibirsk, Stanford, Cornell, Orsay, Frascati, Tsukuba, Geneva. The described above limitations were\nsubstantially improved (by two orders of magnitude) due to higher energy, larger\ncirculating current and better detectors. For example, the two(three)-photon annihilation of electron-positron pair6 measured on LEP collider in CERN (Geneva)\nwith beam energy \u03b5 = 45 \u2212 101 GeV [34] gives \u039b\u2212 > 258 GeV and \u039b+ > 415 GeV.\nThe last limit means that QED is checked for distance l \u2265 5 * 10\u221217 cm.\n\n2.2\n\nInelastic processes\n\nAt low energy \u03b5 \u223c m the electromagnetic processes are sorted usually over powers of fine-structure constant \u03b1 = e2 = 1/137 in frame of perturbation theory.\nThe cross sections of simplest two-particle processes: electron(positron)-electron\nscattering, photon-electron scattering, annihilation of electron-positron pair into\ntwo photon or pair of charged particles are of order \u03b12 /m2 = r02 \u223c 10\u221225 cm2 . In\nmany-particle processes each additional particle adds factor \u03b1 to the cross sections. Such processes were considered only in the form of RC, as it was discussed above. At high energy \u03b5 \u226b m the situation changes; the magnitude of\nthe cross sections is determined mainly by the dependence on energy. Understanding of importance of such classification arose along with development colliding\nbeam program. The processes, diagram of which contains two blocks (each of\nwhich is attached to charged particle line) connected with photon(photons) line,\nhave nondecreasing as a function of energy total cross section. Besides the power\nconstancy in some cases there are the logarithmic growth with energy.7 The important example is the process of soft n-photon radiation in electron(positron)electron scattering which was studied by Victor Galitsky and I [36]. The emission\n6\nTo elastic e+ e\u2212 scattering and to the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 there is an additional (and quite\nsignificant for used energy) contribution from Z boson. So these processes can't be used for pure\nQED test.\n7\nThe only process which is fallen out this scheme is the elastic electron(positron)-electron\nscattering where the total cross sections diverges at any energy.\n\n8\n\n\fof classical (\u03c9 \u226a \u03b5) photons occurs in an independent way so that the cross section of process with the emission of n photons may be represented as, see e.g.\nQ\n[35]: d\u03c3n = d\u03c30 ni=1 dW (ki )/n!, where \u03c30 is the cross section of elastic process,\ndW (ki ) = |j|2d3 ki/2\u03c9i here\ncurrent, for electron scattering off\n\u221a j\u03bc is the \"classical\"\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCoulomb center j\u03bc = i 2e(p\u03bc /(kp) \u2212 p\u03bc /(kp ))/(2\u03c0), where p\u03bc (p\u2032\u03bc ) is the initial\n(final) electron momentum, generally each line of charged particle in the process\ndiagram contributes to the current the combination \u00b1p\u03bc /(kp). For bremsstrahlung\nd\u03c31 = d\u03c30 dW (k), where d\u03c30 is the Rutherford formula. Integrating dW (k) over\nphoton emission angles \u03a9 one obtains\nZ\n\u221a\n2x2 + 1\n2\u03b1 d\u03c9\n\u03a6(x), \u03a6(x) = \u221a\n1 + x2 ) \u2212 1, (2)\nln(x\n+\ndI(\u03c9, x) = dW (k) =\n\u03c0 \u03c9\nx 1 + x2\nwhere 4m2 x2 = \u2212(p \u2212 p\u2032 )2 = 4p2 sin2 (\u03b8/2), \u03b8 is the electron scattering angle. In\nthe limiting cases one has: x \u226a 1, \u03a6(x) = 4x2 /3 and x \u226b 1, \u03a6(x) = ln 4x2 \u2212 1.\nThe universal function \u03a6(x) defines the probability dependence on the momentum\ntransfer in soft photon radiation.\nTo find the integral cross section one has to integrate d\u03c30 dI(\u03c9, x) over the\nmomentum transfer x. Taking into account that the Rutherford cross section d\u03c30 =\n(\u03c0Z 2 \u03b12 /m2 )dx2 /x4 it is clear that the main contribution gives region x \u226a 1. The\nminimal value of x is attained when all the momenta are collinear: 4m2 x2min =\n\u03c9 2 m4 /4\u03b54 . Within logarithmic accuracy one can put x2max = 1. Substituting the\nfunctions in d\u03c30 dI(\u03c9, x) for x \u226a 1 and performing integration one find the spectrum\nof bremsstrahlung of the photon with energy \u03c9:\n\u03c31 = (16/3)(Z 2 \u03b13 /m2 )(d\u03c9/\u03c9) ln(4\u03b52 /m2 \u03c9). The region x \u226b 1 does not contribute\nbecause of fast decreasing of the Rutherford cross section with x increase.\nThe result of similar analysis for bremsstrahlung at electron-electron(positron)\nscattering (Z = 1) differs from this expression only by logarithm argument:4\u03b52 /m2 \u03c9 \u2192\n8\u03b53 /m3 \u03c9 and radiation takes place in the direction of motion of both colliding particles.\nIn the case of many photons radiation the integration over photon emission\nQ\nangles can be performed independently, so that d\u03c3n = d\u03c30 ni=1 dI(\u03c9i, x)/n!. Of\ncourse,for electron-electron(positron) scattering in c.m.s. one has to use the corresponding classical current. However the only region of small momentum transfer\ncontributes and final results is expressed in terms of the function \u03a6(x). Since at\nx \u226a 1, \u03a6(x) \u221d x2 starting from n \u2265 2 there is no divergence at x = 0 and with\nhigh accuracy one can put xmin = 0. So, 1) the cross section d\u03c3n does not contain\nlarge logarithm; 2) the value d\u03c3n can be calculated within power accuracy (discarded terms \u223c m2 /\u03b52 ); 3) the main contribution gives region x \u223c 1; 4) at x \u226b 1\nthe cross section looks like lnn xdx2 /x4 and because convergence of the integral one\ncan put xmax = \u221e within accuracy \u223c m2 /\u03b52 . Thus, the cross section of n photon\nradiation at electron-electron(positron) collision is\nd\u03c3ne = 2\u03c0\n\n\u03b12\nm2\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03b1\n\u03c0\n\n\u0013n\n\nn\n\u03bd(n) Y\nd\u03c9i\n, \u03bd(n) =\nn! i=1 \u03c9i\n\n9\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03a6n (x)\n\ndx\n,\nx3\n\n(3)\n\n\fhere \u03bd(2) = 5/4 + 7\u03b6(3)/8, \u03bd(3) = 3[8\u03b6(3) \u2212 1]/5, \u03b6(3) = 1.202.. is Riemann's zeta\nfunction. The simple combinatory analysis shows that when m photons are emitted\nin the direction of one particle and n \u2212 m photons are emitted in the direction of\nn\nanother particle the corresponding cross section is d\u03c3ne (m, n \u2212 m) = Cm\nd\u03c3ne /2n .\nFor the double bremsstrahlung in the case when photons are emitted in opposite\ndirections d\u03c32e (1, 1) = d\u03c32e /2 and in the case when both photons are emitted in the\none direction d\u03c32e (2, 0) = d\u03c32e (0, 2) = d\u03c32e /4.\nSo considered cross section grows logarithmically with energy increase at n = 1,\nwhile at n \u2265 2 it doesn't dependent on energy.\n2.2.1\n\nSingle bremsstrahlung in electron-(electron)positron collision\n\nThis simplest inelastic process is represented by 8 Feynman diagrams and the differential cross section is very cumbersome. In high-energy region which is of main\ninterest, one can decompose cross section over powers of m/\u03b5. Moreover the calculation simplified essentially if one integrates contributions of the radiation block\nof diagram in tensor form taking into account invariance properties of QED [37].\nIn the center of mass system (c.m.s.) of initial particles the emitted photons are\nconcentrated manly in the narrow cones along momenta of each of initial particles. The integral spectral cross section in the each direction [38, 39] with power\naccuracy (to within terms \u223c m2 /\u03b52 ) is\n4\u03b13 d\u03c9 \u03b5\u2032\nd\u03c3c (1) = d\u03c3c (2) = 2\nm \u03c9 \u03b5\n\n\u03b5\u2032\n\u03b5\n2\n+ \u2032\u2212\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n3\n\n!\"\n\n4\u03b52 \u03b5\u2032\nln\nm2 \u03c9\n\n!\n\n#\n\n1\n\u2212\n,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2032 = \u03b5\u2212\u03c9. This cross section is the largest which can be observed in colliding\nbeam experiment and grows logarithmically with energy, e.g. for \u03b5 = 1 GeV and\nin the interval 0.1 \u2264 \u03c9/\u03b5 \u2264 1 it attains \u03c3 \u223c 10\u221225 cm2 . The main contribution\n\u221a\nto the cross section gives the interval of low momentum transfer q = \u2212q 2 :\n(m3 \u03c9/(4\u03b52\u03b5\u2032 ) \u2264 q \u2264 m) so that deviation angle of radiating particle is less than\nm/\u03b5. When the scattering angle of an electron(positron) \u03b8 \u226b m/\u03b5 the radiation\n(within a logarithmic accuracy) is directed along momenta of charged particles and\nphoton emission cross section from initial(i) and final(f) particle is (see e.g.[40])\n\u03b1 d\u03c9\n\u03b1 d\u03c9\n\u03b52\n\u03b5\u20322\n\u03b5\u03b8\n\u03b5\u03b8\nd\u03c3i (1) =\n1 + \u20322 ln\nd\u03c3e\u2032 + e\u2212 , d\u03c3f (1) =\n1 + 2 ln\nd\u03c3e+ e\u2212 ,\n\u03c0 \u03c9\n\u03b5\nm\n\u03c0 \u03c9\n\u03b5\nm\n(5)\n\u2032\nwhere d\u03c3e+ e\u2212 is the electron-positron scattering cross section in the c.m.s. of final\nparticles and d\u03c3e+ e\u2212 is the electron-positron scattering cross section in the c.m.s.\nof initial particles.\n!\n\n2.2.2\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\nDouble bremsstrahlung in electron-(electron)positron collision\n\nRadiation of two photons at e\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212 (e+ ) collision is of evident interest for colliding\nbeam experiments. The most interesting is the case when photons are emitted in\n10\n\n\fopposite directions along the momenta of colliding particles, because the coincidence of two photon registration permits to separate the effect from background.\nThis process was used as a monitor of beam collisions and for cross sections normalization. The use of method of invariant integration of tensors representing the\nradiation blocks mentioned in previous subsection, simplifies essentially the calculation of integral spectrum (the process is represented by 40 diagrams). The\nqualitative properties of dependence of the process cross section on momentum\ntransfer given above for soft photons emission are valid for any energy of photons,\nbut the radiation blocks should be found for hard photons. The spectrum of double\nbremsstrahlung in c.m.s. has the form [41]:\n8\u03b14\n\u03c92\n\u03c91 \u03c922\n\u03c91\n\u03c92 \u03c912\nd\u03c3\u03c91 \u03c92 =\n1\n+\n\u03b7\n+\n1\n+\n1\n+\n+\n1\n+\n\u03b72\n1\n\u03c0m2\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5 \u03b52\n\u03b5 \u03b52\n)\n\u03c912 \u03c922\n5 7\u03b6(3)\n1 7\u03b6(3)\n7\u03b6(3)\nd\u03c91 d\u03c92\n+ 2 2 \u03b73\n, \u03b71 = \u03bd(2) = +\n, \u03b72 = +\n, \u03b73 =\n.

This form is very convenient for comparison\nwith experimental data. For soft photon the spectrum coincides with Eq.(3).\nThe first observation of double bremsstrahlung was done in Novosibirsk [42].\nA special study of the double bremsstrahlung process as monitoring device was\nperformed at ACO in Orsay [43]. Achieved accuracy (\u223c 3%) was record for high\nenergy QED. It is striking that it was in measurement of 4-th order process. Bearing\nin mind that the double bremsstrahlung can be observed in quite clean conditions\nand has enough large cross section which is known within very good accuracy, this\nprocess was used as standard method for luminosity measurement in Novosibirsk,\nOrsay and Frascati.\n2.2.3\n\nPair creation in electron-(electron)positron collision\n\nAnother 4-th order process, which cross section doesn't decrease with energy, is\nthe electroproduction process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 + N. There are two types of diagrams\npresenting this process: 1) one-photon, where the final particles are created by a\nphoton radiated from one of lines of the initial electron or positron; 2) two-photon,\nwhere the final particles are created at collision of two photons, radiated from\neach of initial particles (photon-photon colliding beams). The last mechanism is\nespecially important since the final states, including hadrons, which are even at\ncharge conjugation (C = 1), can be produced with cross section which doesn't\ndecrease with energy, while in the one-photon channel C = \u22121 and cross section\nof annihilation into hadron is decreasing as 1/\u03b52.\nThe properties as well as values of contributions of one-photon and two-photons\ndiagrams differ significantly. The main contributions is given by the two-photon\n11\n\n\fdiagrams. For creation of e+ e\u2212 pair in electron-positron collision this contribution\nto the total cross section is (with an accuracy up to terms \u223c m2 /\u03b52 )\n\n458\n\u03b14\n28L3 \u2212 178L2 + (490 \u2212 82\u03c0 2 )L + 1203\u03b6(3) + \u03c0 2 78 ln 2 +\n\u03c32 =\n2\n27\u03c0m\n3\n#\n4\n\u03b1\n\u2212676 =\n[1.04L3 \u2212 6.59L2 \u2212 11.8L + 104]\n(7)\n\u03c0m2\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere L = ln 4\u03b52/m2 .

In the limit \u03b5 \u226b m the cross section increases as a cub of logarithm of energy.\n2. Two of these logarithms originate from integration over the transverse momenta\nof photons emitted from the initial particles, the third one from integration over\nthe longitudinal momenta of the created pair.\n3. At moderate energy the main term (\u221d L3 ) is compensated essentially by the rest\nlogarithmic terms and constant, e.g. for \u03b5 = 5 GeV the compensation diminishes\nthe cross section \u03c32 Eq.(7) which is about 2/3 of the main term.\nThe contribution to the total cross section of each set of one-photon diagrams\n(connected with one line of initial particles) is [45]\n\u03b14\n\u03b14\n2\n\u03c31 =\n(231\u03c0 \u2212 2198)L =\n0.51L.\n(8)\n162\u03c0m2\n\u03c0m2\nIt is significantly smaller than \u03c32 .\nIf detectors measure outgoing particles at large polar angles only, another kinematic region than in the main term of the cross section \u03c32 Eq.(7) contributes in\nthe corresponding cross section. In the case when the both polar angle of created\nparticles are \u03b8+ = \u03b8\u2212 = \u03c0/2 the differential over the angles of created pair cross\nsection of pair electroproduction has the form [47]\n\u03b14 ln (2\u03b52 (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6)/m2 )\nd\u03c3\nq\n,\n=\ndc+ dc\u2212 d\u03c6\n2\u03c0\u03b520 m2 /\u03b52 + 2(1 \u2212 cos \u03c6)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere c\u00b1 = cos \u03b8\u00b1 , \u03c6 = \u03c6+ \u2212 \u03c6\u2212 + \u03c0 is the non-coplanarity angle, \u03b50 is the lowest\nenergy of particles of created pair (registration threshold). This cross section has\nvery sharp peak at \u03c6 = 0. This important peculiarity was used for observation.\nLarge angle electroproduction of electron-positron pair was first observed at VEPP2 [49, 50]. Data support the distribution Eq.(9).\n\n2.3\n2.3.1\n\nHadron production\nVector mesons\n\nOne of the main goals of electron-positron colliders of the first generation was production of pions and kaons to study electromagnetic form factors of pions and kaons\n12\n\n\fat the positive (time-like) momentum transfers. In 1960, when the INP project was\nin progress, Sakurai [51] proposed the non-Abelian gauge theory of strong interactions constructed upon the QED pattern. The gauge invariance in QED means\nthat the invariance under local phase transformation \u03c8 \u2192 exp(ie\u039b(x))\u03c8 forces one\nto introduce a new field, which is to be identified with the electromagnetic field A\u03bc\ncoupled universally (with the constant e) to the conserved current constructed out\nof electrically charged fields. To maintain the invariance under the mentioned transformation it's necessary also to perform the transformation A\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + \u2202\u039b/\u2202x\u03bc .\nIn [51] the Yang-Mills theory was used: if one requires that the non-Abelian gauge\ntransformation associated with the isospin I conservation is local in character then\none is forced to introduce the vector field with the isospin I = 1 (\u033a\u00b1 , \u033a0 mesons\nin modern notation) coupled universally (with the constant f\u033a ) to the isospin current constructed out of all fields having nonvanishing isospins. In [51] this result\nwas generalized by adding the baryon and hypercharge conservation. This means\nappearance of two vector fields (\u03c9, \u03c6 neutral mesons in modern notation) coupled universally (with the constants fB , fY ) to the baryon B and hypercharge Y\ncurrents constructed out of all fields having nonvanishing baryon number (hypercharge). This development indicated that one can hope for a first class physics at\nelectron-positron colliders.\nSide by side with outlined above theory, the indications that strong-interacting\nvector mesons play important role followed from analysis of nucleon electromagnetic form factors and some inelastic \u03c0 \u2212p reactions. Connection between these approaches was established by Gell-Mann and Zachariasen [52], where it was stressed\nthat in isovector electromagnetic form factors of hadrons the diagrams dominate,\nwhere photon interacts with hadrons via \u033a0 meson. The model which takes into\naccount only such diagrams\n\nwas called the vector dominance model (VDM). In this model the pion electromagnetic form factor is eF\u03c0 (t) = g\u03b3\u033a f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0 /(m2 \u2212 t), where g\u03b3\u033a is the amplitude of \u03b3 \u2192 \u033a0 transition, t = q 2 , q is the photon momentum, m is the mass\nof \u033a0 meson. Similarly, the isovector electromagnetic form factor of nucleon is\neF1N (t)/2 = g\u03b3\u033a f\u033aN N /2(m2 \u2212 t). At zero momentum transfer F\u03c0 (0) = F1N (0) = 1\nbecause the electric charge is universal. From g\u03b3\u033a f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0 /m2 = g\u03b3\u033a f\u033aN N /m2 = e it\nfollows for all particles with isospin 1:\n1)f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0 = f\u033aN N = . . . = f\u033a ;\n\n2)g\u03b3\u033a = em2\u033a /f\u033a .\n\n(10)\n\nThis is the consequence of \u033a0 meson dominance in isovector form-factor. What was\n13\n\n\fdone above can be expressed in the form current-field identity:\nj\u03bcI\u03b1 (x) = m2\u033a \u033a\u03b1\u03bc (x)/f\u033a ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u033a\u03b1\u03bc (x) is the vector field describing \u033a mesons (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3).\nThe general form of the hadron electromagnetic current in the vector dominance\nmodel, which is expressed in terms of \u033a, \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons fields, reads [53]:\nj\u03bchad (x) = e(m2\u033a \u033a3\u03bc (x)/f\u033a + m2\u03c9 \u03c9\u03bc (x)/f\u03c9 + m2\u03c6 \u03c6\u03bc (x)/f\u03c6 ).\n\n(12)\n\nThe field \u033a3\u03bc is connected with isovector states (e.g. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), while the fields \u03c9 and\n\u03c6 are connected with isoscalar states (e.g. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K + K \u2212 ) and can be mixed up.\nThe corresponding currents are [54]\nh\n\ni\n\nj\u03bcY = m2\u03c6 cos \u03b8Y \u03c6\u03bc (x) \u2212 m2\u03c9 sin \u03b8Y \u03c9\u03bc (x) /fY ,\nh\n\ni\n\nj\u03bcB = m2\u03c6 sin \u03b8B \u03c6\u03bc (x) + m2\u03c9 cos \u03b8B \u03c9\u03bc (x) /fB ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b8Y and \u03b8B are the mixing angles. The hadron electromagnetic current is\nj\u03bchad = j\u03bc3 + j\u03bcY /2. In the limit of exact SU(3) symmetry \u03b8B = \u03b8Y = 0, fY =\n\u221a\n3f\u033a /2. In the broken SU(3) symmetry \u03b8B 6= 0, \u03b8Y 6= 0, in mass mixing model\n\u03b8B = \u03b8Y = 39\u25e6 , in current mixing model \u03b8B = 21\u25e6 , \u03b8Y = 33\u25e6 .\nTaking into account that \u033a0 meson is highly unstable, so that m = m\u033a \u2212\ni\u0393\u033a /2.one has for \u033a0 contribution to pion electromagnetic form factor F\u03c0 (t) =\nm2\u033a /(m2\u033a \u2212 t \u2212 i\u0393\u033a m\u033a ). This means that\n|F\u03c0 (t)|2 =\n\nm4\u033a\n(m2\u033a \u2212 t)2 + \u03932\u033a m2\u033a\n\n(14)\n\nhas sharp resonance peak at m2\u033a = t = 4\u03b52 with the enhancement \u223c m2\u033a /\u03932\u033a .\nSimilarly, the sharp peaks at t = m2\u03c9 and t = m2\u03c6 should be observed in the cross\nsections of production of isoscalar states (e.g. \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K + K \u2212 ).\nLet us consider decay of vector meson into the electron-positron pair and decay\nof \u033a meson into the pion pair.\n\nThe partial width of decay V \u2192 e+ e\u2212 is\n\u0393V e + e \u2212\n\n4\u03c0 \u03b12 mV\n=\n3 fV2\n\n2m2e\n1+ 2\nmV\n\n!\n\n4m2e\n1\u2212 2\nmV\n14\n\n!1/2\n\nme\n4\u03c0 \u03b12 mV\n1+O\n=\n2\n3 fV\nmV\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00134 #\n\n,\n(15)\n\n\fwhere me is the electron mass, the equality gV \u03b3 = em2V /fV is used. Since the value\n\u0393V e+ e\u2212 is measured quite accurately, this expression can be used for determination\nof constants fV . The constant f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0 is determined from the width of decay \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\u0393\u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 =\n\n2\nf\u033a\u03c0\u03c0\nm\u033a 3\nv ,\n4\u03c0 12 R\n\n(16)\n\nq\n\nwhere vR = 1 \u2212 4\u03bc2 /m2\u03c1 is the velocity of the created pion, \u03bc is the pion mass.\nThe total cross section of e+ e\u2212 annihilation into pair of pseudoscalar (\u03c0, K)\nparticles is\n\u03c0\u03b12 3\n\u03c3=\nv |F (t)|2 ,\n(17)\n3t\nq\n\nwhere v = 1 \u2212 4\u03bc2 /t and \u03bc are the velocity and mass of produced particle, F (t)\nis the electromagnetic form factor of corresponding particle, t = 4\u03b52 . So at the\nresonance energy m2\u033a = t one has the cross section \u03c3R = (12\u03c0/m2\u033a )(\u0393\u033a\u03c0\u03c0 \u0393\u033ae+ e\u2212 /\u03932\u03c1 ).\nThis formula has a transparent meaning, since in the quantum theory the resonance cross section in the channel with angular momentum J is \u03c3R = \u03c0\u03bb2 (2J +\n1)\u0393i \u0393f /\u03932V = 4\u03c0(2J + 1)/m2V (\u0393i \u0393f /\u03932V ), where \u03bb = 1/\u03b5 = 2/mV , \u0393i(f ) is the width\nof the resonance into channel i(f ), \u0393V is the total width.\nThe transition of photon into the vector meson (which is the contribution to\nthe hadronic polarization of vacuum) can appear in the purely QED processes\nsuch as e\u2212 e+ elastic scattering or the conversion process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ . The last\nreaction is more appropriate since only one (annihilation) diagram contributes.\nThe most pronounced effect will be near resonance 2\u03b5 \u2243 mV . The cross section of\nthe e\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ process (see Eq.(1)) with the transition \u03b3V taken into account\nacquires an additional factor [55]\n|1 +\n\ng2\nmV\n|2 ,\n\u03b1 2(2\u03b5 \u2212 mV ) + i\u0393V\n\n(18)\n\nwhere g is the effective coupling constant V e\u2212 e+ or V \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ . It can be expressed\nin terms of branching ratio BV e\u2212 e+ = \u0393V e\u2212 e+ /\u0393V and BV \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ , see Eq.(15). The\nprediction [55] was made for only known in 1963 narrow \u03c9 meson. The factor\nEq.(18) results in oscillation of the process cross section with respect to the QED\nprediction in the narrow energy interval (the width \u223c \u0393V ) near \u03b5 \u2243 mV /2: first\nthe cross section is going down, than it turns up and crosses the prediction very\nclose to \u03b5 = mV /2, attains some maximal value and than returns to the prediction.\nSince the ratio \u0393\u033a /m\u033a turns out to be not very small the corrections \u221d \u0393\u033a /m\u033a\nand dependence of term with \u0393\u033a in the resonance denominator m2\u033a \u2212 t \u2212 i\u0393\u033a m\u033a on\nthe pion momentum becomes significant [75]: \u0393\u033a m\u033a \u2192 \u0393\u033a (p/p0 )3 m2\u033a /2\u03b5, where p is\nthe momentum of created pion and p0 is the momentum at m\u033a = 2\u03b5. With regard\n2\nfor final width of \u033a meson Eq.(10) is modified: f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0\n= 1.15 f\u033a2 . Besides, since the\nmasses of \u033a0 and \u03c9 0 mesons appears to be very close, the contribution of process\n15\n\n\fe+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c9 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (the \u033a \u2212 \u03c9 interference) should be taken into account, in spite\nof the fact that in the mentioned channel the isospin invariance is violated, because\nat resonance the cross section \u221d (mV /\u0393V )2 and \u0393\u03c9 \u226a \u0393\u033a . As a result the \u033a-meson\nexcitation curve becomes asymmetric.\nThe first indications on existence of the vector mesons was obtained in the\nhadronic reactions in 1961. The particle which is now called \u033a meson was observed\nin inelastic \u03c0p collisions [56] with mass m\u033a in interval 700-770 MeV and width\n\u0393\u033a \u223c 90 MeV. The \u03c9 was seen in reaction p\u0304p \u2192 2\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 [57] with mass m\u03c9 =787\nMeV and \u0393\u03c9 < 30 MeV. Extraction of properties of the vector mesons in the\nhadronic reaction is quite ambiguous due to involvement of strong interactions and\nonly electron-positron colliders permitted to perform full scale study of the vector\nmesons.\n\nThe neutral vector mesons at colliding e\u2212 e+ beams were observed first at VEPP2 storage ring in INP, Novosibirsk in 1967 [58], [59], where the cross section of\nproduction of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + pair was measured in the region of \u033a-resonance and the\nexcitation curve was obtained. Later the same measurement was performed at\nACO storage ring in LAL, Orsay [60], [61], [62].\nIn isoscalar channel production of \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 was observed first at ACO storage\nring in LAL, Orsay in the region of \u03c9-resonance [63] and the region of \u03c6-resonance\n[64]. The last channel was observed also in INP, Novosibirsk [66]. The reactions\n\u03c6 \u2192 KL0 KS0 , K + K \u2212 were observed at ACO storage ring in LAL, Orsay [64], [65]\nand at VEPP-2 storage ring in INP, Novosibirsk [66]. In these experiments the\nexcitation curves were measured and resonance parameters were obtained.\nRadiative modes of decay of \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons into \u03b7\u03b3, \u03c0 0 \u03b3, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 were investigated in LAL, Orsay [69]. The multi-hadron production in electron-positron\nannihilation was discovered at VEPP-2 storage ring in INP, Novosibirsk [67]. The\nproduction of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 pairs in electron-positron annihilation at energy higher\nthan \u03c6 resonance mass was observed at VEPP-2 storage ring in INP, Novosibirsk\n\u2212 +\n[68]. The vacuum polarization in the process e\u2212 e+\nq\u2192 \u03bc \u03bc due \u03c6 meson contribution according to Eq.(18) (where g 2 = 3B, B = B\u03c6e\u2212 e+ B\u03c6\u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ ) was observed in\nLAL, Orsay [70], the magnitude of oscillation was \u223c 10%. The calibration of storage ring energy was performed using the angular distribution of pions in reaction\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2192 KL0 KS0 , KS0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [71].\nFor review see e.g. [73], [74].\nThe results obtained at the electron-positron colliders confirmed the basic predictions of the vector dominance model, which appears to be remarkably successful,\n16\n\n\fand become outstanding achievement of the new method.\nThe recent parameters of vector mesons are given in the Table 1 below. These\nparameters differs from measured in cited above experiments 1967-1972 on the level\nof one standard deviation but here the accuracy is improved significantly.\nTable 1 Parameters of vector mesons (PDG 2004)\nmeson\n\u033a\n\u03c9\n\u03c6\n\nmV (MeV)\n\u0393V (MeV) \u0393V e+ e\u2212 (keV)\n775.8\u00b1 0.5\n146.4\u00b11.5\n7.02\u00b10.11\n782.59\u00b1 0.11\n8.49\u00b10.08\n0.60\u00b10.02\n1019.456\u00b1 0.020 4.26\u00b10.05\n1.27\u00b10.04\n\nfV2 /4\u03c0\ngV \u03b3 (GeV2 )\n1.96\u00b1 0.03 0.121\u00b10.001\n23.2\u00b1 0.8 0.036\u00b10.001\n14.2\u00b1 0.4 0.078\u00b10.001\n\n2\nFor these parameters one has using Eq.(16) f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0\n/4\u03c0 = 2.79 \u00b1 0.03.\nJust by that time when the main results obtained at the first generation of\nelectron-positron colliders were published (1972-1973), the quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the non-Abelian gauge theory, emerged [76, 77] and in\na short time was accepted as a strong interaction theory. In QCD the basic\ncomponents are quarks and gluons. In this theory the vector mesons discussed\nabove are the composite systems each consisting of light (u, d, s) quark and antiquark with parallel\n\u221a spins coupled by the gluon field (e.g. the state of \u033a meson\n \u0304\nis \u033a = (u\u016b + dd)/ 2). For this picture the VDM is an effective theory valid for\nenergies up to \u223c 1 GeV. Since the parameters of vector mesons are now measured\nwithin percent accuracy the deviations from exact VDM are seen (e.g. from pa2\n/f\u03c12 =1.42 and not 1.15). Description of vector\nrameters given above the ratio f\u033a\u03c0\u03c0\nmesons in QCD frame for mentioned parameters lies indeed in region of strong\ncoupling and should be done in scope of non-perturbative methods. Such analysis\nshould not only explain the origin of the VDM but also clarify deviations from\nexact VDM. In lattice QCD the recent progress is on the level of \u033a meson mass\ncalculation [78]. Since there is no other reliable methods, the vector dominance is\nstill a challenge for QCD.\n\n2.3.2\n\nRadiative return\n\nThe cross section of the process passing through the vector meson contains the\nresonant factor of the type of Eq.(14). Because of this the radiative corrections\nto the cross section of such process, considered first by Victor Fadin and I [79],\ndepended strongly on energy. This is a consequence of photon emission from initial\nparticles, which leads to decrease of produced particle energy.\nIf the initial particles energy is higher than the resonance one \u03b5 > \u03b5R = mV /2,\n\"then the initial particle radiation can \"turn\" the cross section back to the resonance (when final particles energy in their c.m.s. is equal to the resonant one).\n\n17\n\n\fSince the resonance cross section essentially exceeds the cross section far away from\nresonance, this leads to a fast increase of the radiative corrections at \u03b5 > \u03b5R \".\nWithin the logarithmic accuracy in the case of soft photons the radiative corrections, given only by the initial electron and positron, calculated in [79] are written\nas\n\u03c9 2 [\u03c4 (0)2 + \u03932V ]\n\u03b1\n(2 ln 2\u03b3 \u2212 1) ln 2\nd\u03c3 = d\u03c30 (1 + \u03b4(\u03b5)), \u03b4(\u03b5) =\n\u03c0\n\u03b5 [\u03c4 (\u03c9)2 + \u03932V ]\n!#\n)\n2\u03c4 (0)\n13\n2\u03c9\u0393V\n+\n+\narctan\nln 2\u03b3 ,\n\u0393V\n\u03c4 (\u03c9)\u03c4 (0) + \u03932V\n3\n(\n\n\"\n\n(19)\n\nwhere d\u03c30 is the process cross section without radiative corrections depending on\nfinal particles momenta, \u03b5 is the initial energy of electron(positron) in their c.m.s.,\n\u03b3 = \u03b5/me , \u03c9 is the maximal permissible by the event selection energy of photon\nemitted in the direction of initial particle, \u03c4 (\u03c9) = 2(2\u03b5 \u2212 mV \u2212 \u03c9), note that\nthe square of invariant mass of final system is \u22062 = 4\u03b5(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c9). This formula\ncan be applied not far from resonance 8 . The above effect is determined mainly\nby the second term in the square brackets Eq.(19). It may turn out that the\nterm \u03c4 (0)/\u0393V \u226b 1 and its factor is of the order of 1. Then it is possible that\n4\u03b1\u03c4 (0) ln 2\u03b3/\u03c0\u0393V \u2265 1 or \u03b4(\u03b5) \u2265 1! Such paradoxical situation arose due to the\nfact that cross section of the process with photon emission by the initial particle\nturns out to be larger than the cross section of elastic process (without inclusion\nof radiative corrections) at a given energy of the initial particles. The increase of\n\u03b4(\u03b5) stops when the condition of event selection forbids emission of photon with an\nenergy sufficient for the shift to the resonance.\nIt should be noted that Eq.(19) can be applied for an arbitrary process of\nparticle production passing through the resonant state.\nThe radiative return method basing on equations of the type Eq.(19) is widely\nused now at meson factories (BELLE, BABAR, CLEO-C, DAPHNE) for study of\nparticular hadronic reactions from production energy threshold up to the energy\nclose to the machine energy 2\u03b5 (for recent review see e.g. [81]).

The polarization arises because the probability of\nradiative transition with spin flip depends on the orientation of the initial spin.\nExistence of this mechanism was pointed out by Ternov, Sokolov et al. [82], [83].\nThe solution of Dirac equation in the uniform magnetic field was used in these\npaper. However, it is known that typical conditions accelerators correspond to\nvery high quantum numbers, e.g. for H \u223c 104 Oe and energy \u223c 1 GeV the main\nquantum number \u223c 1015 . This means that the motion of particle in accelerator\nand storage ring is almost classical. We with Valery Katkov developed an operator\nmethod for investigation of spin phenomena9 in a quasiclassical approximation 10 .\nThe total probability of spin-flip radiative transition per unit time valid in an\narbitrary magnetic field is [85]\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\"\n#\n2\n8 3\n1\n5 3 \u03b1\u03b3 5 |v\u0307|3\n1\n2\n\u03b6\n1 \u2212 (\u03b6v) \u2212\n(\u03b6(v\u0307 \u00d7 v)) ,\n=\n,\n(20)\nW =\n2T\n9\n15|v\u0307|\nT\n8\nm2\nwhere \u03b6 = \u03b6(t) is the unit spin vector of an electron, v and v\u0307 are the velocity and\nacceleration of an electron, T is the characteristic time of polarization11 . For the\nlongitudinal polarization (\u03b6(v\u0307 \u00d7 v)) = 0 the remaining terms 1 \u2212 (2/9)(\u03b6v)2 do not\ndepend on whether the spin is directed along or opposite to the velocity, so that the\nradiation does not change the spin states with longitudinal polarization. A different\nsituation arises in the case of transverse polarization (\u03b6v) = 0. In this case the\ntransition probability depends on the spin orientation. For electrons (e < 0) the\nprobability of a transition from a state with spin along the field to a state with spin\nopposite to the field is higher than the probability of the inverse transition. For\npositrons (e > 0) the opposite situation occurs. Thus, the resulting polarization\n(radiative polarization) is transverse and for electrons is directed opposite to the\nfield and for positrons along it.\nIt is very important that the probability Eq.(20) is given in the same terms\nas used in the quasiclassical equation for spin motion of Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi\n(BMT) in an external field [88]. The point is that the radiative polarization is\nrather slow process which evolves at background of rather complicate spin motion\n(described by BMT equation) in a storage ring. The kinetic equation which takes\ninto account both factors was derived by Valery Katkov, Volodya Strakhovenko\n9\n\nLater the general quasiclassical operator method was developed by Katkov and I, which is\nactually the formulation of QED in an arbitrary electromagnetic field at high energy [86], [87].\n10\nSimilar procedure was used by Schwinger[84] to find the first quantum correction to the\nintensity of electron radiation in a magnetic field.\n11\nFor magnetic radius r = 150 cm (VEPP-2 facility) and \u03b5 = 700 MeV one has T = 38 minutes.\n\n19\n\n\fand I [89], [90]:\n\u221a\n\"\n#\n2\ne\n1\n8 3\nd\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u2212 v(\u03b6v) \u2212\n= (\u03b6 \u00d7 (\u03bcHR + HE )) \u2212\n(v\u0307 \u00d7 v) ,\ndt\n\u03b5\nT\n9\n15|v\u0307|\n\"\n#\nv(vH)\n(v \u00d7 E)\nHR = \u03b3 H \u2212\n\u2212 (v \u00d7 E) , HE = H \u2212\n,\n1 + 1/\u03b3\n1 + 1/\u03b3\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u03b1/2\u03c0 is the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron, E and H are\nthe fields in the laboratory system, HR is the magnetic field in the rest system\nof the electron. The first term in this equation is just BMT equation, while the\nsecond term appearing due to the spin-flip transitions leads to variation of |\u03b6|.\nIn the simplest case of circular motion in a homogeneous magnetic field decomposing the vector \u03b6 over the unit vectors e1 = v/|v|, e2 = v\u0307/|v\u0307| and e3 = (e1 \u00d7 e2 )\none has from the above equation\n7 \u03b61\n\u03b6 \u03071 = \u2212\n\u2212 \u03a9\u03b62 ,\n9T\n\n\u03b62\n\u03b6 \u03072 = \u03a9\u03b61 \u2212 ,\nT\n\n1\n\u03b6 \u03073 = \u2212\nT\n\n!\n\n8\n\u03b63 + \u221a ,\n5 3\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03a9 = \u03bc\u03b3|v\u0307|.

The polarization is\noriented along the vector (v\u0307 \u00d7 v).\nSide by side with outlined development the very important result concerning\nbehavior of spin vector was obtained by Derbenev, Kondratenko and Skrinsky [91].\nIt was shown that the stable direction of polarization exists for solution of BMT\nequation (n(t) = n(t + \u03c4 ), \u03c4 is the period of revolution) for closed orbits in storage\nring with arbitrary field.\nBasing on mentioned above results and analysis of depolarization effects[92]\nDerbenev and Kondratenko obtained the following equation for the equilibrium\ndegree of polarization for the time essentially larger than T [93]\n)>\n< |v\u0307|2 (v \u00d7 v\u0307)(n \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202n\n8\n\u2202\u03b3\n\u03b6n \u2261 \u03b6n = \u2212 \u221a\n,\n2\n11\n\u2202n\n5 3 < |v\u0307|3 [1 \u2212 9 (nv)2 + 18 ( \u2202\u03b3 )2 ] >\n\n(24)\n\nwhere < . . . > means averaging over azimuth and particle ensemble in\u221astorage ring.\nThis formula summarize many contributions: the external factor 8/5 3 was found\nby Sokolov and Ternov [83], the terms < |v\u0307|2 (v \u00d7 v\u0307)n > and < |v\u0307|3 [1 \u2212 92 (nv)2 ] >\nfollow directly from Eq.(21), the term \u03b3 \u2202n\nreflecting perturbation of quantization\n\u2202\u03b3\n20\n\n\faxis n due to influence of spin-dependent part of the magnetic bremsstrahlung is\n< ( \u2202n\n)2 > describes\nthe invention of Derbenev and Kondratenko [93], the term 11\n18\n\u2202\u03b3\nelectron beam depolarization due to chaotic jumps of the trajectory because of\nquantum nature of radiation process discovered by me and Yuri\u0131\u0308 Orlov during his\nshort stay in Novosibirsk [94]. Emerging, conservation, manipulation and measurement of radiative polarization are discussed in detail in [95], see also Sec.14 in\n[96].\n2.4.2\n\nMeasurement of electron polarization\n\nI. High energy processes\nWe have shown with Victor Fadin that the cross sections of two-particle production\nat electron-positron annihilation are extremely sensitive to electron and positron\npolarizations [97]. So, these reactions can be used for polarization measurement.\nThe cross section for production of a pair of pseudoscalar particles (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 ,\nKS0 KL0 ) in annihilation of transversely (and antiparallel) polarized electrons and\npositrons has the form\n0\n\u03c32p (\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03c32p\n(\u03b8)[1 \u2212 |\u03b6 1 ||\u03b6 2 | cos 2\u03c6],\n\n(25)\n\nwhere |\u03b6 1 | and |\u03b6 2 | are the degrees of polarization of the positrons and electrons,\n\u03c6 is the angle between the plane of production (the plane passing through the momenta of the initial particle p and the final particle q) and the plane perpendicular\n0\n(\u03b8) is the cross section for unpoto the spin direction (the plane of the orbit), \u03c32p\n2\n0\n2 3\n2\nlarized particles: \u03c32p (\u03b8) = \u03b1 v sin \u03b8|F (t)| /8t (cf with Eq.(17)), \u03b8 is the angle\nbetween p and q. . If the initial particles are completely polarized |\u03b6 1 | = |\u03b6 2 | = 1,\nthen \u03c32p (\u03b8, \u03c6 = 0) = 0 (the production plane coincides with the orbit plane) and\n0\n\u03c32p (\u03b8, \u03c6 = \u03c0/2) = 2\u03c32p\n((\u03b8) (the production plane is perpendicular to the orbit\nplane, so that the spin vector lies in the production plane).\nFor production of a pair of muons one has\n\u03c32\u03bc (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u03b12\nv[2 \u2212 v 2 sin2 \u03b8[1 \u2212 |\u03b6 1 ||\u03b6 2 | cos 2\u03c6]].\n4t\n\n(26)\n\nFor relativistic muons v \u2243 1, and we have for completely polarized particles\n\u03c32\u03bc (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = \u03c0/2) = 0 (muon momentum directed along the spin) and\n0\n\u03c32\u03bc (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = 0) = 2\u03c32\u03bc\n(\u03b8) (muon momentum perpendicular to the spin).\nII. Internal scattering effects and polarization measurement [98]\nIt is well known that an important cause of the loss of particles in storage ring is\nthe electron-electron scattering inside the bunch [9]. If this scattering occurs into a\nsufficiently large angle and is such that particles with a large transverse momentum\nand small longitudinal momentum (in the rest system of the beam) acquire a large\nlongitudinal moment, then in conversion to the laboratory system the longitudinal\n21\n\n\fmomentum is subject to the relativistic transformation and can turn out to be larger\nthan the permissible value. As a result the particles are lost. Under some conditions\nthe lifetime of a beam in a storage ring is determined just by the Touschek effect.\nInternal scattering effects depend on the particle polarization, since the electronelectron scattering cross section at the large angles which determine the internal\nscattering effect depends substantially on electron polarization. The beam lifetime\n\u03c4 (\u03c4 is the time in which the number of particles decreases by a factor of two)is\ndetermined by the coefficient \u03b1b :1/\u03c4 = \u03b1b N0 , N0 is the initial number of particles\nin the beam. For example, for a Gaussian distribution of radial momenta of the\nelectrons in the beam one has\n\"\n!\n!\n\u221a\n\u221a \u03b4q\n2 \u03c0\u03b12 m\n2\u03b5\n7 \u03b6 1\u03b6 2\nm2\nm2\n\u03b1b =\nln\n\u2212 \u2212\n+ 2 \u03c0 exp\n1+\nV (\u2206p)2 \u03b4q\n\u2206p 4\n4\nm\n\u03b4q 2\n2\u03b4q 2\n#\n!!\nm\nZ\n\u221a\nm\n2\n\u03b4q\nex (1 \u2212 \u03a6(x))dx ,\n(27)\n\u00d7 1\u2212\u03a6\n\u2212 \u03c0\n\u03b4q\n0\nwhere V is the volume of the beam in the laboratory system, \u2206p is the maximum\npermissible deviation of momentum from the equilibrium value in the laboratory\nsystem, \u03b4q is the mean- square value of the momentum distribution, \u03b5 is the electron\nenergy in the laboratory system, \u03b6 1,2 are the polarization vectors of electrons in the\nbunch, \u03a6(x) is the probability integral. This dependence of the internal scattering\neffect on polarization is used to measure the polarization of electrons in a storage\nring.\nIII. Measurement of polarization by means of Compton scattering [99]\nIn Compton scattering of circularly polarized photons by transversely polarized\nhigh-energy electrons, terms in the cross section arise which depend on the electron\npolarization vector. In head-on collisions of laser photons (with energy \u03c91 ) with\nhigh-energy electrons, the final photons are emitted mainly in a narrow cone with\nan angle \u223c 1/\u03b3 relative to the initial electron direction. The cross section can be\nwritten in a form\n(28)\nd\u03c3 = d\u03c30 + d\u03c31 |\u03b6 1 |\u03be2 sin \u03c6,\nwhere d\u03c30 is the cross section for unpolarized particles, \u03be2 is the degree of circular\npolarization of the photons, and \u03c6 is the angle between the plane perpendicular to\nthe vector \u03b6 1 and the scattering plane. The azimuthal asymmetry coefficient has\nthe form\nd\u03c31\n2\u03bbn(1 + n)2\nP =\n=\u2212 2\n,\n(29)\nd\u03c30\n2\u03bb (1 + n2 ) + (1 + n2 + 2\u03bb)(1 + n4 )\nwhere \u03bb = 2\u03c91 \u03b5/m2 , the photon scattering angle measured from the direction of\nelectron momentum is written as \u03b8 = n/\u03b3 \u226a 1.\n\n22\n\n\fIV. The first experiment\nThe first experimental study of the radiative polarization of electrons has been\ncarried out in the storage ring VEPP-2 in INP, Novosibirsk (see [95]). The polarization measurement was accomplished by the method described above in the\nparagraph II, which utilizes the dependence of internal scattering effects on the polarization of the electrons in the bunch (see Eq.(27)). For the energy chosen (\u03b5 =\n650 MeV) the polarization time is T \u2243 50 min and the theoretical degree of polarization during the experiment is |\u03b63 (2T )| \u2243 0.80 (see Eq.(23)). In this experiment\nit was extremely important to exclude the effect of depolarizing factors. For this\npurpose it is necessary first of all to be sufficiently far from spin resonances. If the\ndepolarizing effects are taken into account, then the expected degree of radiative\npolarization is |\u03b63th (2T )| \u2243 0.66.\nThe measurements were made in the following way. The electron beam in the\nstorage ring was polarized for a time t \u2243 2T , and the particles leaving the beam as\na consequence of internal scattering effects were recorded by two counters. Then\nthe beam was depolarized by application of an external longitudinal field. In this\ncase the rate of departure of particles from the beam increases (i.e., the number\nof counts in the counters increases). The experimental results was obtained for an\nenergy \u03b5 = 638.8 \u00b1 0.8 MeV. A jump was seen in the counting rate, occurring at\nthe turning on of the depolarizing field. From the size of the jump one can deduce\nthe following value of the degree of polarization of the electron beam:\n|\u03b63exp(2T )| \u2243 0.52 \u00b1 0.13,\n\n(30)\n\nwhich is consistent with the expected value of the degree of polarization given\nabove with inclusion of depolarizing effects |\u03b63th (2T )| \u2243 0.66, although it is somewhat smaller. This was the first experimental proof of the existence of radiative\npolarization.\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nLet us list the main results obtained at the electron-positron colliders of the first\ngeneration.\nAt the electron-positron colliding beam facility VEPP-2 in INP, Novosibirsk\n(the maximal observed luminosity L = 3 \u00d7 1028 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ):\n1.

The first observation of e+ e\u2212 collision (1964) in the bremsstrahlung reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3 [72].\nSo, during quite short time new type of accelerator was developed. This included fast ejection of beam from accelerators which were used as injectors (where it\nwas necessary), development of channels, convertors of electron beam into positron\none, fast injection of beams into storage ring, prolong operation of storage ring with\nenough small beam dimensions (to have an acceptable luminosity), which required\nhigh vacuum and damping of many instabilities evolved during operation.\nBoth first generation detectors at VEPP-2 and ACO had some specific features.\n1) A good solid angle. 2) Ability to identify the particles in an observed event.\n3) Reasonable track position accuracy. 4) Momentum analysis. 5) Background\nrejection.\nThe first colliding beam experiments tested QED up to distances more than 100\ntimes smaller than characteristic hadron dimension. Described above results completely changed understanding of electromagnetic structure of hadrons supporting\nfrom one side the basic idea of vector dominance model, but from other side showing shortages of this model. SU(3) symmetry was tested as well as SU(3) breaking\neffects.\n\n24\n\n\fThus, the electron-positron colliding beam project started in INP in 1959 as\nexotic venture, within a decade became one of the main roads of high energy accelerator development.
