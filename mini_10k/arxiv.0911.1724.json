Since the bricks ultimately consist of electrons and nuclei, they form a quantum system with a huge number (> 1020 ) of particles;\nthis is an example of an isolated, macroscopic quantum system.\nFrom a microscopic point of view the state of the system at time t is described by a\nvector\n\u03c8(t) = e\u2212iHt \u03c8(0)\n(1)\nin the system's Hilbert space or a density matrix\n\u03c1(t) = e\u2212iHt \u03c1(0)eiHt ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian of the isolated system and we have set ~ = 1. In this\npaper we prove a theorem asserting that for a sufficiently large quantum system with a\n\"typical\" Hamiltonian and an arbitrary initial state \u03c8(0), the system's state \u03c8(t) spends\nmost of the time, in the long run, in thermal equilibrium. (Of course, before the system\neven reaches thermal equilibrium there could be a waiting time longer than the present\nage of the universe.) This implies the same behavior for an arbitrary \u03c1(0).\nThis behavior of isolated, macroscopic quantum systems is an instance of a phenomenon we call normal typicality [5], a version of which is expressed in von Neumann's\nquantum ergodic theorem [17]. However, our result falls outside the scope of von Neumann's theorem, because of the technical assumptions made in that theorem. Our result\nalso differs from the related results in [4, 15, 16, 12, 13, 10], which use different notions\nof when a system is in an equilibrium state. In particular they do not regard the thermal equilibrium of an isolated macroscopic system as corresponding to its wave function\nbeing close to a subspace Heq of Hilbert space. See Section 6 for further discussion.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the remainder of Section 1, we\ndefine more precisely what we mean by thermal equilibrium. In Section 2 we outline\nthe problem and our result, Theorem 1. In Section 3 we prove the key estimate for the\nproof of Theorem 1. In Section 4 we describe examples of exceptional Hamiltonians,\nillustrating how a system can fail to ever approach thermal equilibrium. In Section 5\nwe compare our result to the situation with classical systems. In Section 6 we discuss\nrelated works.\n\n1.1\n\nThe equilibrium subspace\n\nLet Htotal be the Hilbert space of a macroscopic system in a box \u039b, and let H be its\nHamiltonian. Let {\u03c6\u03b1 } be an orthonormal basis of Htotal consisting of eigenvectors of H\nwith eigenvalues E\u03b1 . Consider an energy interval [E, E + \u03b4E], where \u03b4E is small on the\nmacroscopic scale but large enough for the interval [E, E + \u03b4E] to contain very many\neigenvalues. Let H \u2286 Htotal be the corresponding subspace,\n\b\nH = span \u03c6\u03b1 : E\u03b1 \u2208 [E, E + \u03b4E] .\n(3)\nA subspace such as H is often called a micro-canonical energy shell. Let D be the\ndimension of H , i.e., the number of energy levels, including multiplicities, between E\n2\n\n\fand E + \u03b4E. In the following we consider only quantum states \u03c8 that lie in H , i.e., of\nthe form\nX\n\u03c8=\nc\u03b1 \u03c6 \u03b1\n(4)\n\u03b1\n\nwith c\u03b1 6= 0 only for \u03b1 such that E\u03b1 \u2208 [E, E + \u03b4E].\nAccording to the analysis of von Neumann [17, 18] and others (cf. [6]), the macroscopic (coarse-grained) observables in a macroscopic quantum system can be naturally\n\"rounded\" to form a set of commuting operators,\n\b\nMi i=1,...,k .\n(5)\n\nThe operators are defined on Htotal , but since we can take them to include (and thus\ncommute with) a coarse-grained Hamiltonian, we can (and will) take them to commute\nwith the projection to H , and thus to map H to itself. We write \u03bd = (m1 , . . . , mk ) for\na list of eigenvalues mi of the restriction of Mi to H , and H\u03bd for the joint eigenspace.\nSuch a set of operators generates an orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space\nM\nH =\nH\u03bd ,\n(6)\n\u03bd\n\nwhere each H\u03bd , called a macro-space, represents\nP a macro-state of the system. The\ndimension of H\u03bd is denoted by d\u03bd ; note that \u03bd d\u03bd = D. If any H\u03bd has dimension 0,\nwe remove it from the family {H\u03bd }. In practice, d\u03bd \u226b 1, since we are considering a\nmacroscopic system with coarse-grained observables.\nIt can be shown in many cases, and is expected to be true generally, that among\nthe macro-spaces H\u03bd there is a particular macro-space Heq , the one corresponding to\nthermal equilibrium, such that\ndeq /D \u2248 1 ,\n(7)\n\nindeed with the difference 1 \u2212 deq /D exponentially small in the number of particles.1\nThis implies, in particular, that each of the macro-observables Mi is \"nearly constant\"\non the energy shell H in the sense that one of its eigenvalues has multiplicity at least\ndeq \u2248 D. We say that a system with quantum state \u03c8 (with k\u03c8k = 1) is in thermal\nequilibrium if \u03c8 is very close (in the Hilbert space norm) to Heq , i.e., if\nh\u03c8|Peq |\u03c8i \u2248 1 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Peq is the projection operator to Heq . The corresponding relation for density\nmatrices is\nTr(Peq \u03c1) \u2248 1 .\n(9)\n1\n\nThis dominance of the equilibrium state can be expressed in terms of the (Boltzmann) entropy\nS\u03bd of a macroscopic system in the macro-state \u03bd, be it the equilibrium state or some other (see [9]),\ndefined as S\u03bd = kB log d\u03bd , where kB is the Boltzmann constant: deq /D being close to 1 just expresses\nthe fact that the entropy of the equilibrium state is close to the micro-canonical entropy Smc , i.e.,\nSeq = kB log deq \u2248 kB log D = Smc .\n\n3\n\n\fThe condition (8) implies that a quantum measurement of the macroscopic observable Mi\non a system with wave function \u03c8 will yield, with probability close to 1, the \"equilibrium\"\nvalue of Mi . Likewise, a joint measurement of M1 , . . . , Mk will yield, with probability\nclose to 1, their equilibrium values.\nLet \u03bc(d\u03c8) be the uniform measure on the unit sphere in H [14, 19]. It follows from\n(7) that most \u03c8 relative to \u03bc are in thermal equilibrium. Indeed,\nZ\n1\ndeq\nh\u03c8|Peq |\u03c8i \u03bc(d\u03c8) = Tr Peq =\n\u2248 1.\n(10)\nD\nD\nSince the quantity h\u03c8|Peq |\u03c8i is bounded from above by 1, most \u03c8 must satisfy (8).2\n\n1.2\n\nExamples of equilibrium subspaces\n\nTo illustrate the decomposition into macro-states, we describe two examples. As Example 1, consider a system composed of two identical subsystems designated 1 and 2, e.g.,\nthe bricks mentioned in the beginning of this paper, with Hilbert space Htotal = H1 \u2297H2 .\nThe Hamiltonian of the total system is\nH = H1 + H2 + \u03bbV ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere H1 and H2 are the Hamiltonians of subsystems 1 and 2 respectively, and \u03bbV is\na small interaction between the two subsystems. We assume that H1 , H2 , and H are\npositive operators. Let H be spanned by the eigenfunctions of H with energies between\nE and E + \u03b4E.\nIn this example, we consider just a single macro-observable M, which is a projected\nand coarse-grained version of H1 /E, i.e., of the fraction of the energy that is contained\nin subsystem 1 alone. We cannot take M to simply equal H1 /E because H1 is defined\non Htotal , not H , and will generically not map H to itself, while we would like M to be\nan operator on H . To obtain an operator on H , let P be the projection Htotal \u2192 H\nand set\nH1\u2032 = P H1 P\n(12)\n(more precisely, H1\u2032 is P H1 restricted to H ). Note that H1\u2032 is a positive operator, but\nmight have eigenvalues greater than E. Now define3\nM = f (H1\u2032 /E)\n\n(13)\n\nwith the coarse-graining function\n\n2\n\n\uf8f1\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20.02\nf (x) =\n\uf8f4\n0.04\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\netc.\n\nif x < 0.01,\nif x \u2208 [0.01, 0.03),\nif x \u2208 [0.03, 0.05),\n...\n\n(14)\n\nIt should in fact be true for a large class of observables A on H that, for most \u03c8 relative to \u03bc,\nh\u03c8|A|\u03c8i \u2248 Tr(\u03c1mc A), where \u03c1mc is the micro-canonical density matrix, i.e., 1/D times the identity on\nH . This is relevant to the various results on thermalization described in Section 6.\n3\nP Recall that the application of a function f to a self-adjoint\nP matrix A is defined to be f (A) =\nf (a\u03b1 )|\u03c6\u03b1 ih\u03c6\u03b1 | if the spectral decomposition of A reads A =\na\u03b1 |\u03c6\u03b1 ih\u03c6\u03b1 |.\n\n4\n\n\fThe H\u03bd are the eigenspaces of M; clearly, \u2295\u03bd H\u03bd = H . If, as we assume, \u03bbV is small,\nthen we expect H0.5 = Heq to have the overwhelming majority of dimensions. In a\nthorough treatment we would need to prove this claim, as well as that H1\u2032 is not too\ndifferent from H1 , but we do not give such a treatment here.\nAs Example 2, consider N bosons (fermions) in a box \u039b = [0, L]3 \u2286 R3 ; i.e., Htotal\nconsists of the square-integrable (anti-)symmetric functions on \u039bN . Let the Hamiltonian\nbe\nN\n\u0001\n1 X 2 X\nH =\u2212\n\u2207i +\nv |q i \u2212 q j | ,\n(15)\n2m i=1\ni<j\nwhere the Laplacian \u22072i has Dirichlet boundary conditions, v(r) is a given pair potential,\nand q i is the triple of position coordinates of the i-th particle. Let H again be spanned\nby the eigenfunctions with energies between E and E + \u03b4E.\nIn this example, we consider again a single macro-observable M, based on the operator Nleft for the number of particles in the left half of the box \u039b:\n\b\nNleft \u03c8(q 1 , . . . , q N ) = # i : q i \u2208 [0, L/2] \u00d7 [0, L]2 \u03c8(q 1 , . . . , q N ) .\n(16)\n\nNote that the spectrum of Nleft consists of the N + 1 eigenvalues 0, 1, 2, . . . , N. To\n\u2032\nobtain an operator on H , let P be the projection Htotal \u2192 H and set Nleft\n= P NleftP .\n\u2032\n\u2032\nNote that the spectrum of Nleft\nis still contained in [0, N]. Now define M = f (Nleft\n/N)\nwith the coarse-graining function (14). We expect that for large N, the eigenspace with\neigenvalue 0.5, Heq = H0.5 , has the overwhelming majority of dimensions (and that\n\u2032\nNleft\n\u2248 Nleft ).\n\n2\n\nFormulation of problem and results\n\nOur goal is to show that, for typical macroscopic quantum systems,\nh\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i \u2248 1 for most t .\n\n(17)\n\nTo see this, we compute the time average of h\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i. We denote the time average\nof a time-dependent quantity f (t) by a bar,\nZ\n1 T\ndt f (t) .\n(18)\nf (t) = lim\nT \u2192\u221e T 0\nSince h\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i is always a real number between 0 and 1, it follows that if its time\naverage is close to 1 then it must be close to 1 most of the time. Moreover, for \u03bc-most\n\u03c8(0), where \u03bc is the uniform measure on the unit sphere of H , \u03c8(t) is in thermal\nequilibrium most of the time. This result follows from Fubini's theorem (which implies\nthat taking the \u03bc-average commutes with taking the time average) and the unitary\ninvariance of \u03bc:\nZ\nZ\nZ\niHt\n\u2212iHt\nh\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i \u03bc(d\u03c8) = h\u03c8|e Peq e\n|\u03c8i \u03bc(d\u03c8) = h\u03c8|Peq |\u03c8i \u03bc(d\u03c8) \u2248 1 . (19)\n5\n\n\fThat is, the ensemble average of the time average is near 1, so, for \u03bc-most \u03c8(0), the\ntime average must be near 1, which implies our claim above. So the interesting question\nis about the behavior of exceptional \u03c8(0), e.g., of systems which are not in thermal\nequilibrium at t = 0. Do they ever go to thermal equilibrium?\nAs we will show, for many Hamiltonians the statement (17) holds in fact for all\n\u03c8(0) \u2208 H . From now on, let H denote the restriction of the Hamiltonian to H , and let\n\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6D be an orthonormal basis of H consisting of eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian\nH with eigenvalues E1 , . . . , ED . If\n\u03c8(0) =\n\nD\nX\n\nc\u03b1 \u03c6 \u03b1 ,\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nthen\n\u03c8(t) =\n\nD\nX\n\nc\u03b1 = h\u03c6\u03b1 |\u03c8(0)i\n\ne\u2212iE\u03b1 t c\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 .\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nThus,\nh\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i =\n\nD\nX\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=1\n\nei(E\u03b1 \u2212E\u03b2 )t c\u2217\u03b1 c\u03b2 h\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b2 i .\n\n(22)\n\nIf H is non-degenerate (which is the generic case) then E\u03b1 \u2212 E\u03b2 vanishes only for \u03b1 = \u03b2,\nso the time averaged exponential is \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , and\nh\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i =\n\nD\nX\n\u03b1=1\n\n2\n\nc\u03b1 h\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b1 i .\n\n(23)\n\nThus, for the system to be in thermal equilibrium most of the time it is necessary and\nsufficient that the right hand side of (23) is close to 1.\nNow if an energy eigenstate \u03c6\u03b1 is not itself in thermal equilibrium then when \u03c8(0) =\n\u03c6\u03b1 the system is never in thermal equilibrium, since this state is stationary. Conversely,\nif we have that\nh\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b1i \u2248 1 for all \u03b1 ,\n(24)\nthen the system will be in thermal equilibrium most of the time for all \u03c8(0). This follows\ndirectly from (23) since the right hand side of (23) is an average of the h\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b1 i. We\nshow below that (24) is true of \"most\" Hamiltonians, and thus, for \"most\" Hamiltonians\nit is the case that every wave function spends most of the time in thermal equilibrium.\n\n2.1\n\nMain result\n\nThe measure of \"most\" we use is the following: for any given D (distinct) energy\nvalues E1 , . . . , ED , we consider the uniform distribution \u03bcHam over all Hamiltonians\nwith these eigenvalues. Choosing H at random with distribution \u03bcHam is equivalent\n6\n\n\fto choosing the eigenbasis {\u03c6\u03b1 } according P\nto the uniform distribution \u03bcON B over all\northonormal bases of H , and setting H = \u03b1 E\u03b1 |\u03c6\u03b1 ih\u03c6\u03b1 |. The measure \u03bcON B can be\ndefined as follows: Choosing a random basis according to \u03bcON B amounts to choosing \u03c61\naccording to the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in H , then \u03c62 according to\nthe uniform distribution over the unit sphere in the orthogonal complement of \u03c61 , etc.\nAlternatively, \u03bcON B can be defined in terms of the Haar measure \u03bcU (D) on the group\nU(D) of unitary D \u00d7 D matrices: any given orthonormal basis {\u03c7\u03b1 } of H defines a\none-to-one correspondence between U(D) and the set of all orthonormal bases of H ,\nassociating with the matrix U = (U\u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2208 U(D) the basis\n\u03c6\u03b1 =\n\nD\nX\n\nU\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c7\u03b2 ;\n\n(25)\n\n\u03b2=1\n\nthe image of the Haar measure under this correspondence is in fact independent of the\nchoice of {\u03c7\u03b2 } (because of the invariance of the Haar measure under right multiplication),\nand is \u03bcON B .\nPut differently, the ensemble \u03bcHam of Hamiltonians can be obtained by starting from\na given Hamiltonian H0 on H (with distinct eigenvalues E1 , . . . , ED ) and setting\nH = UH0 U \u22121\n\n(26)\n\nwith U a random unitary matrix chosen according to the Haar measure. Note that,\nwhile considering different possible Hamiltonians H in H , we keep Heq fixed, although\nin practice it would often be reasonable to select Heq in a way that depends on H (as\nwe did in the examples of Section 1.2).\nFor our purpose it is convenient to choose the basis {\u03c7\u03b1 } in such a way that the first\ndeq basis vectors lie in Heq and the other ones are orthogonal to Heq . Then, we have\nthat\ndeq\nX\n|U\u03b1\u03b2 |2\n(27)\nh\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b1 i =\n\u03b2=1\n\nwith U\u03b1\u03b2 the unitary matrix satisfying (25).\nWe will show first, in Lemma 1, that for every 0 < \u03b5 < 1, if D is sufficiently large\nand deq /D sufficiently close to 1, then most orthonormal bases {\u03c6\u03b1 } are such that\nh\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b1i > 1 \u2212 \u03b5 for all \u03b1 .\n\n(28)\n\nThis inequality is a precise version of (24). How close to 1 should deq /D be? The fact\nthat the average of h\u03c8|Peq |\u03c8i over all wave functions \u03c8 on the unit sphere of H equals\ndeq /D, mentioned already in (10), implies that (28) cannot be true of most orthonormal\nbases if deq /D \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b5. To have enough wiggling room, we require that\ndeq\n\u03b5\n> 1\u2212 .\nD\n2\n7\n\n(29)\n\n\fWe will show then, in Theorem 1, that for every (arbitrarily small) 0 < \u03b7 < 1 and for\nsufficiently large D, most H are such that for every initial wave function \u03c8(0) \u2208 H with\nk\u03c8(0)k = 1, the system will spend most of the time in thermal equilibrium with accuracy\n1 \u2212 \u03b7, where we say that a system with wave function \u03c8 is in thermal equilibrium with\naccuracy 1 \u2212 \u03b7 if\nh\u03c8|Peq |\u03c8i > 1 \u2212 \u03b7 .\n(30)\nThis inequality is a precise version of (8). In order to have no more exceptions in time\nthan the fraction 0 < \u03b4 \u2032 < 1, we need to set the \u03b5 in (28) and (29) equal to \u03b7\u03b4 \u2032 .\nLemma 1. Let \u03bcU (D) denote the Haar measure on U(D), and\nn\n\nS\u03b5 := U \u2208 U(D) \u2200\u03b1 :\n\ndeq\nX\n\u03b2=1\n\no\n|U\u03b1\u03b2 |2 > 1 \u2212 \u03b5 .\n\n(31)\n\nThen for all 0 < \u03b5 < 1 and 0 < \u03b4 < 1, there exists D0 = D0 (\u03b5, \u03b4) > 0 such that\nif D > D0 and deq > (1 \u2212 \u03b5/2)D then \u03bcU (D) (S\u03b5 ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4 .\n\n(32)\n\nThe proof of Lemma 1 is given in Section 3. It also shows that D0 can for example\nbe chosen to be\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD0 (\u03b5, \u03b4) = max 103 \u03b5\u22122 log(4/\u03b4), 106\u03b5\u22124 .\n(33)\nFrom (27), we obtain:\n\nTheorem 1. For all \u03b7, \u03b4, \u03b4 \u2032 \u2208 (0, 1), all integers D > D0 (\u03b7\u03b4 \u2032 , \u03b4) and all integers deq >\n(1\u2212\u03b7\u03b4 \u2032 /2)D the following is true: Let H be a Hilbert space of dimension D; let Heq be a\nsubspace of dimension deq ; let Peq denote the projection to Heq ; let E1 , . . . , ED be pairwise\ndistinct but otherwise arbitrary; choose a Hamiltonian at random with eigenvalues E\u03b1\nand an eigenbasis \u03c6\u03b1 that is uniformly distributed. Then, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4,\nevery initial quantum state will spend (1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 )-most of the time in thermal equilibrium\nas defined in (30), i.e.,\nlim inf\nT \u2192\u221e\n\n1 \b\n0 < t < T : h\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i > 1 \u2212 \u03b7\nT\n\n\u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4\u2032 ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere |M| denotes the size (Lebesgue measure) of the set M.\nProof. It follows from Lemma 1 that under the hypotheses of Theorem 1,\nh\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b4 \u2032\nwith probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Thus, since \u03b7\u03b4 \u2032 \u2265 1 \u2212 h\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i \u2265 \u03b7 \u03b4\u0303, where \u03b4\u0303 is\nthe lim supT \u2192\u221e of the fraction of the time in (0, T ) for which h\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b7, it\nfollows that \u03b4\u0303 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2032 .\n\n8\n\n\f2.2\n\nRemarks\n\nNormal typicality. Theorem 1 can be strengthened; with the same sense of \"most\" as\nin Theorem 1, we have that for most Hamiltonians and for all \u03c8(0)\nh\u03c8(t)|P\u03bd |\u03c8(t)i \u2248\n\ndim H\u03bd\n,\ndim H\n\nfor all \u03bd\n\n(35)\n\nfor most t. For \u03bd = eq, this implies that h\u03c8(t)|Peq |\u03c8(t)i \u2248 1. This stronger statement\nwe have called normal typicality [5]. A version of normal typicality was proven by von\nNeumann [17]. However, because of the technical assumptions he made, von Neumann's\nresult, while much more difficult, does not quite cover the simple result of this paper.\nTypicality and probability. When we express that something is true for most H or\nmost \u03c8 relative to some normalized measure \u03bc, it is often convenient to use the language\nof probability theory and speak of a random H or \u03c8 chosen with distribution \u03bc. However,\nby this we do not mean to imply that the actual H or \u03c8 in a concrete physical situation\nis random, nor that one would obtain, in repetitions of the experiment or in a class of\nsimilar experiments, different H's or \u03c8's whose empirical distribution is close to \u03bc. That\nwould be a misinterpretation of the measure \u03bc, one that suggests the question whether\nperhaps the actual distribution in reality could be non-uniform. This question misses\nthe point, as there need not be any actual distribution in reality. Rather, Theorem 1\nmeans that the set of \"bad\" Hamiltonians has very small measure \u03bcHam .\nConsequences for Example 2. From Lemma 1 it follows for Example 2 that typical\nHamiltonians of the form (26) with H0 given by the right hand side of (15) are such\nthat all eigenfunctions are close to H0.5 ; this fact in turn strongly suggests (though\nwe have not proved this) that the eigenfunctions are essentially concentrated on those\nconfigurations that have approximately 50% of the particles in the left half and 50% in\nthe right half of the box.\nEquilibrium Statistical Mechanics. Theorem 1 implies that, for typical H, every\n\u03c8(0) \u2208 H is such that for most t,\nh\u03c8(t)|Mi |\u03c8(t)i \u2248 Tr(\u03c1mc Mi ) ,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u03c1mc is the standard micro-canonical density matrix (i.e., 1/D times the projection\nHtotal \u2192 H ), for all macro-observables Mi as described in Section 1.1. This justifies\nreplacing |\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)| by \u03c1mc as far as macro-observables in equilibrium are concerned.\nHowever, this does not, by itself, justify the use of \u03c1mc for observables A not among the\n{Mi }. For example, consider a microscopic observable A that is not \"nearly constant\"\non the energy shell H . Then, standard equilibrium statistical mechanics tells us to use\n\u03c1mc for the expected value of A in equilibrium. We believe that this is in fact correct for\nmost such observables, but it is not covered by Theorem 1. Results concerning many\nsuch observables are described in Section 6. These results, according to which, in an\nappropriate sense,\nh\u03c8(t)|A|\u03c8(t)i \u2248 Tr(\u03c1mc A)\n(37)\n9\n\n\ffor suitable A and \u03c8(0), are valid only in quantum mechanics. The justification of the\nbroad use of \u03c1mc in classical statistical mechanics relies on rather different sorts of results\nrequiring different kinds of considerations.\n\n3\n\nProof of Lemma 1\n\nProof.

According to Theorem 1, bad Hamiltonians form a very small subset of the set of all Hamiltonians. Of course, to establish\nthat (24) holds for a particular Hamiltonian can be a formidable challenge. Moreover,\nthe small subset might include all standard many-body Hamiltonians (e.g., all those\nwhich are a sum of kinetic and potential energies). But there is no a priori reason to\nbelieve that this should be the case.\nThe first example consists of two non-interacting subsystems. This can be expressed\nin the framework provided by Example 1 in Section 1.2 with the Hamiltonian H =\nH1 + H2 + \u03bbV by setting \u03bb = 0. Let {\u03c61i } be an orthonormal basis of H1 consisting of\neigenvectors of H1 with eigenvalues Ei1 , and {\u03c62j } one of H2 consisting of eigenvectors\nof H2 with eigenvalues Ej2 . Clearly, for \u03bb = 0 not every wave function will approach\nthermal equilibrium. After all, in this case, the \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j form an eigenbasis of H, while\n\b\nH = span \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j : Ei1 + Ej2 \u2208 [E, E + \u03b4E]\n(74)\nand\n\n\b\nHeq = span \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j : Ei1 \u2208 [0.49E, 0.51E) and Ei1 + Ej2 \u2208 [E, E + \u03b4E] .\n\n(75)\n\nThus, any \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j such that Ei1 + Ej2 \u2208 [E, E + \u03b4E] but, say, Ei1 < 0.49E, will be an\nexample of an element of H that is orthogonal to Heq and, as it is an eigenfunction of\nH, forever remains orthogonal to Heq .\nAs another example, we conjecture that some wave functions will fail to approach\nthermal equilibrium also when \u03bb is nonzero but sufficiently small. We prove this now\nfor a slightly simplified setting, corresponding to the following modification of Example\n1 of Section 1.2. For the usual energy interval [E, E + \u03b4E], let H be, independently of\n\u03bb, given by (74), and, instead of H1 + H2 + \u03bbV , let H be given by\nH = H(\u03bb) = P (H1 + H2 + \u03bbV )P ,\n\n(76)\n\nwhere P is the projection to H . Then H defines a time evolution on H that depends\non \u03bb. (Note that H is still an \"energy shell\" for all sufficiently small \u03bb, as all nonzero\neigenvalues of H(\u03bb) are still contained in an interval just slightly larger than [E, E +\u03b4E],\nand the corresponding eigenvectors lie in H .) Let Heq for \u03bb 6= 0 also be given by (75).\nAgain, choose one particular \u03c61i and one particular \u03c62j (independently of \u03bb) so that\nEi1 + Ej2 \u2208 [E, E + \u03b4E] and Ei1 < 0.49E, and consider as the initial state of the system\nagain\n\u03c8(t = 0) = \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j ,\n(77)\nwhich evolves to\n\n\u03c8(\u03bb, t) = e\u2212iH(\u03bb)t \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j .\n\n(78)\n4\n\nSuppose for simplicity that H(\u03bb = 0) = H1 + H2 is non-degenerate. Then, according to\nstandard results of perturbation theory [7], also H(\u03bb), regarded as an operator on H ,\n4\n\nSince this requires that no eigenvalue difference of H1 , Ei1 \u2212 Ei1\u2032 , coincides with an eigenvalue\ndifference of H2 , Ej2 \u2212 Ej2\u2032 , we need to relax our earlier assumption that system 1 and system 2 be\nidentical; so, let them be almost identical, with slightly different eigenvalues, and let H1 and H2 each\nbe non-degenerate.\n\n14\n\n\fis non-degenerate for all \u03bb \u2208 (\u2212\u03bb0 , \u03bb0 ) for some \u03bb0 > 0; moreover, its eigenvalues E(\u03bb)\ndepend continuously (even analytically) on \u03bb, and so do the eigenspaces. In particular,\nit is possible to choose for every \u03bb \u2208 (\u2212\u03bb0 , \u03bb0 ) a normalized eigenstate \u03c6(\u03bb) \u2208 H of\nH(\u03bb) with eigenvalue E(\u03bb) in such a way that \u03c6(\u03bb) and E(\u03bb) depend continuously on\n\u03bb, and \u03c6(\u03bb = 0) = \u03c61i \u2297 \u03c62j .\nWe are now ready to show that for sufficiently small \u03bb > 0,\nh\u03c8(\u03bb, t)|Peq |\u03c8(\u03bb, t)i \u2248 0\n\n(79)\n\nfor all t; that is, \u03c8(\u03bb, t) is nearly orthogonal to Heq for all t, and thus is never in thermal\nequilibrium. To see this, note first that since \u03c6(0) \u2248 \u03c6(\u03bb) for sufficiently small \u03bb, and\nsince e\u2212iH(\u03bb)t is unitary, also\ne\u2212iH(\u03bb)t \u03c6(0) \u2248 e\u2212iH(\u03bb)t \u03c6(\u03bb)\n\n(80)\n\n(with error independent of t). Since the right hand side equals\ne\u2212iE(\u03bb)t \u03c6(\u03bb) \u2248 e\u2212iE(\u03bb)t \u03c6(0) ,\n\n(81)\n\nhe\u2212iH(\u03bb)t \u03c6(0)|Peq |e\u2212iH(\u03bb)t \u03c6(0)i \u2248 h\u03c6(0)|Peq |\u03c6(0)i = 0 .\n\n(82)\n\nwe have that\n\nThis proves (79) with an error bound independent of t that tends to 0 as \u03bb \u2192 0.\nAnother example of \"bad\" Hamiltonians is provided by the phenomenon of Anderson\nlocalization (see in particular [1, 11]): Certain physically relevant Hamiltonians possess\nsome eigenfunctions \u03c6\u03b1 that have a spatial energy density function that is macroscopically non-uniform whereas wave functions in Heq should have macroscopically uniform\nenergy density over the entire available volume. Thus, some eigenfunctions are not close\nto Heq , violating (24).\n\n5\n\nComparison with classical mechanics\n\nIn classical mechanics, one would expect as well that a macroscopic system spends\nmost of the time in the long run in thermal equilibrium. Let us define what thermal\nequilibrium means in classical mechanics. (We defined it for quantum systems in (8).)\nWe denote a point in phase space by X = (q 1 , . . . , q N , p1 , . . . , pN ). Instead of the\northogonal decomposition of H into subspaces H\u03bd we consider a partition of an energy\nshell \u0393 in phase space, \u0393 = {X : E \u2264 H(X) \u2264 E + \u03b4E}, into regions \u0393\u03bd corresponding\nto different macro-states \u03bd, i.e., if the micro-state X of the system is in \u0393\u03bd then the\nmacro-state of the system is \u03bd. It has been shown [8] for realistic systems with large\nN that one of the regions \u0393\u03bd , corresponding to the macro-state of thermal equilibrium\nand denoted \u0393eq , is such that, in terms of the (uniform or Liouville) phase space volume\nmeasure \u03bc on \u0393,\n\u03bc(\u0393eq )\n\u2248 1.\n(83)\n\u03bc(\u0393)\n15\n\n\fThough the subspaces H\u03bd play a role roughly analogous to the regions \u0393\u03bd , a basic\ndifference between the classical and the quantum cases is that while every classical\nphase point in \u0393 belongs to one and only one \u0393\u03bd , and thus is in one macro-state, a\nquantum state \u03c8 need not lie in any one H\u03bd , but can be a non-trivial superposition of\nvectors in different macro-states. (Indeed, almost all \u03c8 do not lie in any one H\u03bd . That\nis why we defined being in thermal equilibrium in terms of \u03c8 lying in a neighborhood\nof Heq , rather than lying in Heq itself.)\nThe time evolution of the micro-state X is given by the solution of the Hamiltonian\nequations of motion, which sends X (at time 0) to Xt (at time t), t \u2208 R. We expect that\nfor realistic systems with a sufficiently large number N of constituents and for every\nmacro-state \u03bd, most initial phase points X \u2208 \u0393\u03bd will be such that Xt spends most of\nthe time in the set \u0393eq . This statement follows if the system is ergodic,5 but in fact is\nmuch weaker than ergodicity. Theorem 1 is parallel to this statement in that it implies,\nfor typical Hamiltonians, that initial states (here, \u03c8(0)) out of thermal equilibrium will\nspend most of the time in thermal equilibrium; it is different in that it applies, for typical\nHamiltonians, to all, rather than most, initial states \u03c8(0).\n\n6\n\nComparison with the literature\n\nVon Neumann [17] proved, as his \"quantum ergodic theorem,\" a precise version of\nnormal typicality (defined in Section 2.2); his proof requires much more effort, and\nmore refined methods, than our proof of Theorem 1. However, his theorem assumes\nthat the dimension d\u03bd of each macro-space H\u03bd is much smaller than the full dimension\nD, and thus does not apply to the situation considered in this paper, in which one of the\nmacro-spaces, Heq , has the majority of dimensions. The reason von Neumann treated\nthe more difficult case of small d\u03bd but left out the easier and particularly interesting\ncase of the thermal equilibrium macrostate is that he had in mind a notion of thermal\nequilibrium different from ours. He thought of a thermal equilibrium wave function \u03c8,\nnot as one in (or close to) a particular H\u03bd , but as one with kP\u03bd \u03c8k2 \u2248 d\u03bd /D for every\n\u03bd, i.e., one for which |\u03c8ih\u03c8| \u2248 \u03c1mc in a suitable coarse-grained sense. Because of this\ndifferent focus, he did not consider the situation presented here. We also note that von\nNeumann's quantum ergodic theorem makes an assumption on H that we do not need in\nour Theorem 1; this assumption, known as a \"no resonances\" [6, 16] or \"non-degenerate\nenergy gaps\" [10] condition, asserts that\n(\neither \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 = \u03b2 \u2032\n(84)\nE\u03b1 \u2212 E\u03b2 6= E\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 E\u03b2 \u2032 unless\nor \u03b1 = \u03b2, \u03b1\u2032 = \u03b2 \u2032 .\nThe Schnirelman Theorem [2] states that, in the semi-classical limit and under suitable hypotheses, the Wigner distribution corresponding to an eigenstate \u03c6\u03b1 becomes the\n5\n\nA classical system is ergodic if and only if the time evolved micro-state Xt spends, in the long run,\na fraction of time in each (measurable) set B \u2286 \u0393 that is equal to \u03bc(B)/\u03bc(\u0393) for \u03bc-almost all X.\n\n16\n\n\fmicro-canonical measure. That is, the \u03c6\u03b1 have a property resembling thermal equilibrium, similar to our condition (24) expressing that all eigenstates are in thermal equilibrium. Srednicki [15] observed other thermal equilibrium properties in energy eigenstates\nof example systems, a phenomenon he referred to as \"eigenstate thermalization.\"\nThe results of [16, 12, 10] also concern conditions under which a quantum system\nwill spend most of the time in \"thermal equilibrium.\" For the sake of comparison, their\nresults, as well as ours, can be described in a unified way as follows. Let us say that a\nsystem with initial wave function \u03c8(0) equilibrates relative to a class A of observables\nif for most times \u03c4 ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\u03c8(\u03c4 )|A|\u03c8(\u03c4 )i \u2248 Tr |\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)|A for all A \u2208 A .\n(85)\n\nWe then say that the system thermalizes relative to A if it equilibrates and, moreover,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n(86)\nTr |\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)|A \u2248 Tr \u03c1mc A for all A \u2208 A ,\n\nwith \u03c1mc the micro-canonical density matrix (in our notation, 1/D times the projection\nP to H ). With these definitions, the results of [16, 12, 10] can be formulated by saying\nthat, under suitable hypotheses on H and \u03c8(0) and for large enough D, a system will\nequilibrate, or even thermalize, relative to a suitable class A .\nOur result is also of this form. We have just one operator in A , namely Peq . We\nestablish thermalization for arbitrary \u03c8(0) assuming H is non-degenerate and satisfies\nh\u03c6\u03b1 |Peq |\u03c6\u03b1 i \u2248 1 for all \u03b1, which (we show) is typically true.\nVon Neumann's quantum ergodic theorem [17] establishes thermalization for a family A of commuting observables; A is the algebra generated by {M1 , . . . , Mk } in the\nnotation of Section 1.1. He assumes that the dimensions of the joint eigenspaces H\u03bd\nare not too small and not too large; that H obeys (84); he makes an assumption about\nthe relation between H and the subspaces H\u03bd that he shows is typically true; and he\nadmits arbitrary \u03c8(0). See [5] for further discussion. Rigol, Dunjko, and Olshanii [13]\nnumerically simulated an example system and concluded that it thermalizes relative to\na certain class A consisting of commuting observables.\nTasaki [16] as well as Linden, Popescu, Short, and Winter [10] consider a system\ncoupled to a heat bath, Htotal = Hsys \u2297 Hbath , and take A to contain all operators\nof the form Asys \u2297 1bath . Tasaki considers a rather special class of Hamiltonians and\nestablishes thermalization assuming that\nmax |h\u03c6\u03b1 |\u03c8(0)i|2 \u226a 1 ,\n\u03b1\n\n(87)\n\na condition that implies that many eigenstates of H contribute to \u03c8(0) appreciably and\nthat can (more or less) equivalently be rewritten as\nX\n4\nh\u03c6\u03b1|\u03c8(0)i \u226a 1 .\n(88)\n\u03b1\n\n17\n\n\fUnder the assumption (88) on \u03c8(0), Linden et al. establish equilibration for H satisfying\n(84). They also establish a result in the direction of thermalization under the additional\nhypothesis that the dimension of the energy shell of the bath is much greater than\ndim Hsys .\nReimann's mathematical result [12] can be described in the above scheme as follows.\nLet A be the set of all observables A with (possibly degenerate) eigenvalues between\n0 and 1 such that the absolute difference between any two eigenvalues is at least (say)\n10\u22121000 . He establishes equilibration for H satisfying (84), assuming that \u03c8(0) satisfies\n(88).\nAcknowledgements.
