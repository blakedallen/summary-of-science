That is, one can obtain violations of\nBell inequalities by tensorizing a local state with itself. In the second part of this work we study how large these\nviolations can be. In particular, we show the existence of quantum states with very low Bell violation but such\nthat five copies of them give very large violations. In fact, this gap can be made arbitrarily large by increasing\nthe dimension of the states.\n\nThat by combining two quantum objects one can get something better than the sum of their individual uses seems to be\na characteristic feature of quantum mechanics. In particular,\nin quantum information theory this effect has been extensively\nstudied in quantum channel theory (see for instance [26], [13],\n[10]) and entanglement theory (see for instance [14], [25]).\nActually, some of these works show a much stronger behavior\ncalled super-activation. That is, one can get a quantum effect by combining two objects with no quantum effects. The\naim of this work is to study this phenomenon in the context of\nquantum nonlocality.\nThe study of quantum nonlocality dates back to the seminal\nwork by Bell ([5]). In this work the author took the apparently\nmetaphysical dispute arising from the previous intuition of\nEinstein, Podolski and Rosen ([11]) and formulated it in terms\nof assumptions which naturally lead to a refutable prediction.\nGiven two spatially separated quantum systems, controlled by\nAlice and Bob respectively and specified by a bipartite quantum state \u03c1, Bell showed that certain probability distributions\np(a, b|x, y) obtained from an experiment in which Alice and\nBob perform some measurements x and y in their corresponding systems with possible outputs a and b respectively, cannot be explained by a local hidden variable model (LHVM).\nSpecifically, Bell showed that the assumption of a LHVM implies some inequalities on the set of probability distributions\np(a, b|x, y), since then called Bell inequalities, which are violated by certain quantum probability distributions produced\nwith an entangled state.\nThough initially discovered in the context of foundations\nof quantum mechanics, violations of Bell inequalities, commonly known as quantum nonlocality, are nowadays a key\npoint in a wide range of branches of quantum information science. In particular, nonlocal probability distributions provide\nthe quantum advantage in the security of quantum cryptography protocols ([2], [1]), communication complexity protocols\n(see the recent review [6]) and in the generation of trusted random numbers ([24]).\nIn order to pass from the probability distribution level to the\nquantum state level, we say that a bipartite quantum state \u03c1 is\nnonlocal if it can lead to certain quantum probability distributions p(a, b|x, y) in an Alice-Bob scenario violating some\nBell inequality. In the case where any probability distribution\np(a, b|x, y) produced with the state \u03c1 can be explained by a\nLHVM, we say that \u03c1 is local.\nDue to the importance of quantum nonlocality, it is a funda-\n\nmental problem to study whether the nonlocality of a quantum\nstate can be super-activated. That is,\ncan the state \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1 be nonlocal if \u03c1 is local?\n\n(1)\n\nSome interesting progress have been made on this problem.\nIndeed, after some numerical attempts ([15]), two partial answers to question (1) have recently been obtained in [8] and\n[21]. In the first work, a positive answer to question (1) was\ngiven in the multipartite setting and for the restricted case of\nvon Neumann measurements. On the other hand, in [21] a\nstrong super-activation result was given when one is restricted\nto the particular measurement scenario of two inputs and two\noutputs per party. Despite this considerable effort, question\n(1) has remained open until now. In this work we show that\nthe general problem (1) has a positive answer. Furthermore,\nas we will explain later, previous results suggest that we can\nget an unbounded Bell violation with the state \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1.\nWe must mention that some previous results on superactivation have been obtained in different contexts of quantum nonlocality. A remarkable one was given by Peres, who\nshowed that super-activation of two-qubit Werner states can\noccur when local pre-processing is allowed on several copies\nof the state of Alice and Bob ([23]). Super-activation was\nalso considered for arbitrary entangled states by allowing local pre-processing on the tensor product of different quantum\nstates ([20]). In contrast, our results do not make use of any local pre-processing. The problem of super-activation was also\nstudied in the context of tensor networks ([8], [9]).\"\n\nI. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN A MEASUREMENT\nSETTING\n\nA standard scenario for studying quantum nonlocality consists of two spatially separated and non-communicating parties, usually called Alice and Bob. Each of them can choose\namong different observables, labeled by x = 1, * * * , N in\nthe case of Alice and y = 1, * * * , N in the case of Bob.\nThe possible outcomes of these measurements are labeled by\na = 1, * * * , K in the case of Alice and b = 1, * * * , K in the\ncase of Bob. Following the standard notation, we will refer\nto the observables x and y as inputs and call a and b outputs.\nFor fixed x, y, we will consider the probability distribution\n\n\f2\n(P (a, b|x, y))K\na,b=1 of positive real numbers satisfying\nK\nX\n\nII.\n\nP (ab|xy) = 1.\n\na,b=1\n\n\u0010\n\nThe collection P =\n\n\u0011N,K\nP (a, b|x, y)\n\nx,y;a,b=1\n\nwill be also re-\n\nferred as a probability distribution.\nGiven a probability distribution P , we will say that P is\nClassical or LHVM if\nZ\nP\u03c9 (a|x)Q\u03c9 (b|y)dP(\u03c9)\n(2)\nP (a, b|x, y) =\n\u03a9\n\nfor every x, y, a, b, where (\u03a9,\nP \u03a3, P) is a probability space,\nP\u03c9 (a|x) \u2265 0 for all a, x, \u03c9, a P\u03c9 (a|x) = 1 for all x, \u03c9 and\nanalogous conditions for the Q\u03c9 (b|y)'s. We denote the set of\nclassical probability distributions by L. On the other hand,\nwe say that P is Quantum if there exist two Hilbert spaces\nH1 , H2 such that\nP (a, b|x, y) = tr(Exa \u2297 Fyb \u03c1)\n\n(3)\n\nfor every x, y, a, b, where \u03c1 \u2208 B(H1 \u2297 H2 ) is a density operator and (Exa )x,a \u2282 B(H1 ), (Fyb )y,b \u2282 B(H2 ) are two sets of\noperators representing positive-operator valued measurements\n(POVM) on Alice's and Bob's systems. We denote the set of\nquantum probability distributions by Q.\nIt is not difficult to see that both L and Q are convex sets\nand, furthermore, that L is a polytope. The inequalities describing the facets of this set are usually called Bell inequalities. As we have explained before, the fact that L is strictly\ncontained in Q or, equivalently, that there exist some elements Q \u2208 Q which violate certain Bell inequalities, is a\ncrucial point in quantum information theory. We say that a\nbipartite quantum state is local if for all families of POVMs\n{Exa }x,a , {Fyb }y,b , the corresponding probability distribution\n\u0001\nQ = tr(Exa \u2297 Fyb \u03c1) x,y;a,b belongs to L. Otherwise, we\nsay that \u03c1 is nonlocal. It is known that a pure state |\u03c6ih\u03c6| is\nnonlocal if and only if it is entangled ([12]). However, the situation is not as nice in the case of general states. Indeed, it\nwas shown in [27], [4] that there exist certain entangled states\n\u03c1 which are local, laying the foundation for the later understanding of quantum entanglement and quantum nonlocality\nas different quantum resources.\nIn order to separate the sets L and Q, it is very helpful to\nslightly extend the notion of Bell inequality. For an arbitrary\n2\n2\nM \u2208 RN K , we consider the quotient\n\u03c9 \u2217 (M )\nLV (M ) =\n,\n\u03c9(M )\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere we define \u03c9 (M ) = sup{|hM, Qi| : Q \u2208 Q} and\n\u03c9(M ) = sup{|hM, P i| : P \u2208 L} and for every probability\ndistribution P we denote\nhM, P i =\n\nN,K\nX\n\na,b\nMx,y\np(a, b|x, y)\n\nx,y;a,b=1\n\n(see [17], [18], [16] for a complete study on this). Note that\nthe existence of Bell violations can be stated by: LV (M ) > 1\nfor certain M 's.\n\nTHE KHOT AND VISNOI GAME\n\nIn the remarkable paper [7] the authors used a particularly\ninteresting game GKV to give very tight estimates in the context of large violations of Bell inequalities. This game is usually called the Khot-Visnoi game (or KV game) because it was\nfirst defined by Khot and Visnoi to show a large integrality\ngap for a semidefinite programming relaxation of certain complexity problems (see [19] for details). Since the KV game\nwill play an important role in this work we will give a brief\ndescription of it (see [7] for a much more complete explanation). For any n = 2l with l \u2208 N and every \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 21 ] we\nconsider the group {0, 1}n and the Hadamard subgroup H.\nThen, we consider the quotient group G = {0, 1}n/H which\nn\nis formed by 2n cosets [x] each with n elements. The questions of the games (x, y) are associated to the cosets whereas\nthe answers a and b are indexed by [n]. The game works as\nfollows: The referee chooses a coset [x] uniformly at random\nand one element z \u2208 {0, 1}n according to the probability distribution P r(z(i) = 1) = \u03b7, P r(z(i) = 0) = 1 \u2212 \u03b7, independently of i. Then, the referee asks question [x] to Alice and\nquestion [x \u2295 z] to Bob. Alice and Bob must answer with an\nelement of their corresponding cosets and they win the game\nif and only if a \u2295 b = z. We can realize the KV game as\nn\n2\n2\nan element in RN K with N = 2n and K = n. Actually,\nit is very easy to see that for every probability distribution\n\u0001N,K\nP = P (a, b|[x], [y]) [x],[y]=1;a,b=1 we have\nhGKV , P i = Ez\n\n\u0001\nn XX\nP a, a \u2295 z|[x], [x \u2295 z] .\nn\n2\n[x] a\u2208[x]\n\nNow, as a consequence of a clever use of the hypercontractive\n\u03b7\ninequality, one can see that \u03c9(GKV ) \u2264 n\u2212 1\u2212\u03b7 (see [7, Theorem 7]). Furthermore, one can define, for any a \u2208 {0, 1}n, the\na(i)\n\n\u221a\nvector |ua i \u2208 Cn by ua (i) = (\u22121)\nfor every i = 1, * * * , n.\nn\nIt is trivial from\u0001the properties of the Hadamard group that\nPa = |ua ihua | a\u2208[x] defines a von Neumann measurement\n(vNm) for every [x]. These measurements will define Alice\nand Bob's quantum strategies. Then, as was shown in [7], for\n\u03b7 = 21 \u2212 ln1n , Q the quantum probability distribution constructed with\nmaximally entangled state in dimension n,\nPthe\nn\n|\u03c8n i = \u221a1n i=1 |iii, and the previous vNms, one obtains\n\n\u03c9(G) \u2264 C\n\n1\n1\n,\nand hGKV , Qi \u2265 C \u2032\nn\n(ln n)2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C and C \u2032 are universal constants which can be taken to\nbe, respectively, C = e4 and C \u2032 = 4 ([28]).\nIII. SUPER-ACTIVATION OF QUANTUM NONLOCALITY\n\nIn order to show our super-activation result let's consider\nthe isotropic state\n\u03b4p = p|\u03c8d ih\u03c8d | + (1 \u2212 p)\n\n11\n,\nd2\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nwhere |\u03c8d ih\u03c8d | is the maximally entangled state in dimension\nd and d112 is the maximally mixed state. It was proven in [3],\n[4] that \u03b4p is local if\np=\n\n(3d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 1)(d\u22121)\n.\n(d + 1)dd\n\nLet's fix d = 8 so that p = \u03b1 1d for a certain \u03b1 > 1 and from\nthis point on let us remove the p-dependence of \u03b4.\nBy the previous explanation, it suffices to find a natural number k and a quantum probability distribution Q constructed with the state \u03b4 \u2297k such that Q does not belong to L.\nTherefore, let's consider an arbitrary k and note that \u03b4 \u2297k can\nbe expanded as\npk |\u03c8d ih\u03c8d |\u2297k + * * * * * * = pk |\u03c8dk ih\u03c8dk | + * * * * * * ,\n\n1\n.\ndk\n\n(8)\n\nTo see this, we first note that hGKV , Qi i \u2265 0 for every i,\nwhere Qi is the quantum probability distribution formed by\nthe vNms and the ith term in (6). Indeed, this trivially follows\nfrom the fact that GKV is a game, so it has, in particular,\npositive coefficients. Therefore, there will be no cancelations\nand it is enough to show (8) for the first term in (6). Since\nthe state in the first term is the maximally entangled state we\nknow again from Section II that hGKV , Q1 i is greater or equal\nthan C \u2032 (ln1n)2 = C \u2032 (k ln1 d)2 . Therefore, we obtain\npk hGKV , Q1 i\nC\u2032 k\n1\nhGKV , Qi\n\u2265\n\u2265\n,\n\u03b1\n1\n1\nC\n(k ln d)2\nC dk\nC dk\nwhich tends to \u221e when k \u2192 \u221e since \u03b1 > 1. The proof now\nfollows trivially.\n\nLV\u03c1 := sup\n\nQUANTIFYING QUANTUM NONLOCALITY AND\nSOME SHARP UPPER BOUNDS\n\nBeyond their interest from a foundational point of view,\nquantifying quantum nonlocality is very helpful in quantum\ninformation theory. Roughly speaking, if violations of Bell\n\n(9)\n\nsup\n\nLV\u03c1 (M ).\n\nN,K M\u2208RN 2 K 2\n\nThe quantity LV\u03c1 was introduced in [16] as a natural measure of how nonlocal a state \u03c1 is (see [22] for a more complete explanation). Indeed, since nonlocality usually refers to\nprobability distributions, it is natural to quantify the amount of\nnonlocality of a state \u03c1 by measuring how nonlocal the quantum probability distributions constructed with \u03c1 can be. LV\u03c1\nmeasures exactly this. In fact, [18, Proposition 3] allows us to\nwrite LV\u03c1 in the following alternative way, which emphasizes\nits connection to nonlocality:\nLV\u03c1 =\n\n2\n\u2212 1,\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\nwhere \u03c0\u03c1 is the infimum over N, K and P \u2208 Q\u03c1 of\nn\no\nsup \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] : \u03bbP + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)P \u2032 \u2208 L for some P \u2032 \u2208 L .\nActually, the KV game was considered in [7] to show that\nLV|\u03c8d i \u2265 C (lndd)2 for certain universal constant C, providing in this way a tight lower bound which almost matches the\nknown upper bound estimate LV\u03c1 \u2264 d for any d-dimensional\nstate \u03c1 ([17], [22]). Furthermore, it was recently shown that\nwe cannot completely remove the ln factor in the estimate\ngiven by Buhrman et al. Specifically, the following result was\nproven in [22].\nd\nLV|\u03c8d i \u2264 D \u221a\n,\nln d\n\n(10)\n\nwhere D is a universal constant. As we will show in the following section, beyond their own interest, these logarithmiclike estimates are very useful to obtain results about nonmultiplicativity.\nV.\n\nIV.\n\n\u03c9\u03c1\u2217 (M )\n,\n\u03c9(M )\n\no\nn\nwhere \u03c9\u03c1\u2217 (M ) = sup hM, Qi : Q \u2208 Q\u03c1 and \u03c9(M ) is as\ndefined in Section I. Finally, the key object of study is\n\n(7)\n\nTherefore, we will finish our proof by showing that for a high\nenough k, the quantum probability distribution Q constructed\nwith our vNms and the state \u03b4 \u2297k satisfies\nhGKV , Qi\n> 1.\nC d1k\n\nLV\u03c1 (M ) =\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the rest of the terms in Equation (6) are formed by tensor products of |\u03c8d ih\u03c8d |'s and d112 's with certain coefficients\nwhich are products of p's and (1 \u2212 p)'s.\nIn order to find our violation of a Bell inequality, we will\nconstruct the quantum probability distribution and the violated\nBell inequality at the same time. Indeed, we will consider\nthe KV game for n = dk , GKV , and the associated vNms in\ndimension n. Now, on the one hand, we have said in Section\n(II) that\n\u03c9(GKV ) \u2264 C\n\ninequalities mean that quantum mechanics is more powerful\nthan classical mechanics, the amount of Bell violation quantifies how much more powerful it is (see [17],[18] and [16]\nfor some recent results in this direction). In order to define a\nmeasure of quantum nonlocality for a given state \u03c1, let's denote Q\u03c1 the set of all quantum probabilities constructed with\n2\n2\nthe state \u03c1. Then, for a given element M \u2208 RN K , we will\ndenote\n\nUNBOUNDED ALMOST-ACTIVATION\n\nAccording to the previous section, the problem of the multiplicativity of quantum nonlocality could be written as\nis\n\nLV\u03c1\u2297k\n> 1 for certain states \u03c1?\n(LV\u03c1 )k\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nHere, k is any natural number bigger than 1. The proof presented in Section III shows that question (11) is affirmative\neven for k = 2 and a state \u03c1 verifying LV\u03c1 = 1. But, how\nlarge can the quotient in (11) be? In this section we will show\nthat if we forget about super-activation and we focus on the\nmultiplicativity properties of the measure LV\u03c1 , we can give\na much stronger result than the previous one in terms of the\namount of violation. Actually, we will show the following\nresult:\nFor every \u01eb > 0 and \u03b4 > 0 we have a state \u03c1 (of a sufficiently high dimension d) verifying that\nLV\u03c1 < 1 + \u01eb and LV\u03c1\u22975 > \u03b4.\n\n(12)\n\nNote that in this case we can make the quotient in (11) arbitrarily large for a fixed number k = 5 by considering a state\n\u03c1 of a sufficiently high dimension. This is very different from\nthe estimate obtained in Section III, where the increasing k is\nnecessary to get a large violation. The prize to pay now is that\nwe don't know that our initial state is local, but just almost\nlocal in terms of Bell violations.\n1 \u2212\u03b1\n2\n,\nIn order to prove this result, let's consider p = (ln d)d\nwhere \u03b1 is an arbitrary constant in (0, 21 ) and\n\u03be = p|\u03c8d ih\u03c8d | + (1 \u2212 p)\n\n11\n.\nd2\n\nUsing Equation (10) and the fact that the state\nwe deduce that\nLV\u03be \u2264 Dp\n\nd\n1\n\n(ln d) 2\n\n11\nd2\n\nis separable\n\n+ (1 \u2212 p) \u2264 D(ln d)\u2212\u03b1 + 1.\n\n(13)\n\nOn the other hand, by the same computations as in Section\nIII, we can deduce that, if Q is the quantum probability distribution constructed with the vNms associated to the KV game\n(see Section II) in dimension d5 and the state \u03be \u22975 , we have\nthat\nLV\u03be\u22975 \u2265\n\n1\nhGKV , Qi\nd5\nC\u2032\n= C \u2032\u2032 (ln d) 2 \u22125\u03b1 .\n\u2265 p5\n2\n\u03c9(GKV )\nC (5 ln d)\n\nTaking \u03b1 =\nenough d.\n\n1\n11\n\nthe statement follows by considering a high\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nabout one of the most puzzling and powerful effects in nature. In particular, we have answered the recent enhancement\nof problem 21 posed by Liang in the Hannover List of Open\nProblems in Quantum Information ([29]). Actually, the proof\nwe have presented in this work is very simple and, hopefully,\ncompletely understandable for a general audience.\nBeyond the proof of this fundamental result, one could ask\nabout the amount of Bell violation in this super-activation effect. We have shown that the amount of Bell violation attainable by a quantum state is a highly non-multiplicative measure. Note that the enhancement of a Bell violation via tensor\nproducts had already been studied in [15]. However, the enhancement known for mixed states was very mild. Here, we\nhave shown that one can get arbitrarily large Bell violations\nby taking a finite number of tensor products of an almostlocal state. Some results support the conjecture that this phenomenon is also true when we study super-activation, so that\none could obtain an unbounded super-activation result; this\nwould mean that one can obtain an arbitrarily large amount\nof Bell violations by taking a finite number of tensor products\nof a local state. Indeed, Equation (10) strongly supports that\na logarithmic-like estimate like the one given in [3, Equation\n(12)] for von Neumann measurements should hold for general\nPOVMs. The proofs we have presented above could be then\nfollowed step by step to show an unbounded super-activation\nresult. However, at the moment of this writing we do not know\nhow to adapt our techniques in [22] to get such an estimate.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that, since the quantum probability distributions that we have used in all our proofs are\nconstructed with vNms (the ones used in the KV game), one\ncan obtain unbounded super-activation of quantum nonlocality in the restricted setting of vNms. Indeed, using the estimate p\u03c6L \u2265 \u03a9( lndd ) obtained in [3] for vNms, we can follow\nexactly the same steps as in the previous proofs to obtain an\narbitrarily large amount of Bell violation with a finite number\nof tensor products of a state which is local under vNms. However, we must mention that restricting to vNms in the study\nof activation of quantum nonlocality (or, in general, problems\ninvolving tensor products of states) distorts the problem quite\na lot.\nWe would like to thank Y.-C.
