Rajagopal incorporated the dispersion (\u03c312 ) of the Bell-CHSH observable\n(B) [4], the mean (b1 ) of which is already fitted in the Horodecki model, while Canosa and\nRossignoli fitted the mean of generalized Bell-CHSH observables (B\u03b1 ). We combine their two\napproaches into a three-parameter (b1 , \u03c312 , \u03b1) model, for which we uncover a very interesting\ncontinuum (\u2212\u221e < \u03b1 < \u221e) of exact Hilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities (sec. VII B 2,\nFig. 11, (37)) - in which, among other features, the golden ratio [5, 6] appears.\nOur model can be interestingly contrasted with a three-parameter (bq , \u03c3q2 , q) one also\nof Abe and Rajagopal [7] (sec. VII B), which incorporates the q-parameter (nonextensitity/Tsallis index/escort parameter), rather than the \u03b1-parameter of B\u03b1 (34). The continuum (over q) of separability probabilities (independently of the metric employed) is simply a\n\u221a\nconstant (equal to 21 in the Hilbert-Schmidt case, and to the \"silver mean\", 2 \u2212 1, for the\nBures and other monotone metrics). We examine a two-parameter (b1 , \u03b1) Canosa-Rossignolitype model also exhibiting an interesting (non-flat) continuum (sec. VII B 3, Fig. 12, (38)).\nAdditionally, we obtain exact (Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures) separability probabilities for the\nthree-parameter Tsallis-Lloyd-Baranger model [8] (sec. VII C)\nOur results emerge in a study initially focused on embedding certain information metrics\nover the two-level quantum systems into a q-framework. We find evidence (sec. V, Fig. 1)\nthat Srednicki's recently-stated biasedness criterion for noninformative priors [9] yields rankings of priors fully consistent with an information-theoretic test of Clarke [10], previously\napplied to quantum systems by Slater [11].\n\nII.\n\nNONINFORMATIVITY OF PRIORS\n\nSome fifteen years ago, Wootters asserted that \"there does not seem to be any natural\nmeasure on the set of all mixed states\" [12, p. 1375]. He did, however, consider random\ndensity matrices with all eigenvalues fixed. He remarked that once \"the eigenvalues are fixed,\nthen all the density matrices in the ensemble are related to each other by the unitary group,\nso it is natural to use the unique unitarily invariant measure to define the ensemble\" [12, p.\n\n2\n\n\f1375] (cf. [13]).\nArguing somewhat similarly, Srednicki recently proposed that in choosing a prior distribution over density matrices, \"we can use the principle of indifference, applied to the unitary\nsymmetry of Hilbert space, to reduce the problem to one of choosing a probability distribution for the eigenvalues of \u03c1. There is, however, no compelling rationale for any particular\nchoice; in particular, we must decide how biased we are towards pure states\" [9, p. 6].\nTo be specific, we find, in an analysis involving four prior probabilities (p's), that the\ninformation-theoretic-based comparative noninformativity test devised by Clarke yields a\nranking\npFq=1 > pB > pBq=1 trunc > pF\n\n(1)\n\nfully consistent (Fig. 1) with Srednicki's recently-stated criterion for priors of \"biasedness to\npure states\". Two of the priors are formed by extending certain metrics of quantum-theoretic\ninterest from three- to four-dimensions - by incorporating the q-parameter. The threedimensional metrics are the Bures (minimal monotone) metric over the two-level quantum\nsystems and the Fisher information metric over the corresponding family of Husimi distributions. The priors pB and pF are the (independent-of-q) normalized volume elements of these\nmetrics, and pFq=1 is the normalized volume element of the q-extended Fisher information\nmetric, with q set to 1. While originally intended to similarly be the q-extension of the\nBures metric, with q then set to 1, the prior pBq=1 trunc , actually entails the truncation of the\nonly off-diagonal entry of the extended Bures metric tensor. Without this truncation, the\nq-extended Bures volume element is null, as is also the case in three higher-dimensional quantum scenarios we examine (including the Abe-Rajagopal two-qubit states (sec. VII B), for\n\u221a\nwhich we further find q-invariant Bures separability probabilities equal to 2 \u22121 [the \"silver\nmean\"] and Hilbert-Schmidt ones equal to\n\n1\n2\n\n(sec. VII B 1), and the Tsallis-Lloyd-Baranger\n\ntwo-qubit states (sec. VII C)).\n\nIII.\n\nBURES METRIC\n\nThe Bures (minimal monotone) metric - the volume element of which we normalize to\nobtain one (pB ) of the four prior probability distributions of principal interest here - yields\nthe statistical distance between neighboring mixed quantum states (\u03c1) [14, 15]. It provides\nan embedding of the Fubini-Study metric [16, sec. IV], which gives the statistical distance\n3\n\n\fprior prob.\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0.995 0.996 0.997 0.998 0.999\n\nr\n\nFIG. 1: Four univariate marginal prior probability distributions in the near-to-pure-state region\nr \u2208 [1 \u2212 \u01eb, 1], where r is the radial coordinate in the Bloch sphere representation of two-level\nquantum systems, and r = 1 corresponds to a pure state.

If we do employ\nthe fully correct form, with this dqdr term included, we find that the volume element is\nnull. This, of course, could not yield a meaningful prior probability distribution. However,\nhaving proceeded under the impression that the dqdr term was null, we obtained a number\nof results that appear to be of interest and of some relevance. Therefore, for much of this\nstudy, we will treat the dqdr term as null, and thus deal with a truncated q-extended Bures\nmetric.\nIn the context of the harmonic oscillators states, Pennini and Plastino have argued that,\nin addition to the physical lower bound (ignorance-amount) of q \u2265 0 that in a quantal\nregime, q can be no less than 1 [23] - due to the Lieb bound on the Wehrl entropy [24].\nHowever, for the two-level quantum systems to the study of which we restrict ourselves here,\nthe lower bound on the Wehrl entropy is\n\n1\n2\n\n[25, eq. (12)]. We, thus, consider q \u2208 [ 21 , \u221e]\n\nto be the range of possible values of the escort parameter q. In practice, though, we will,\nfor numerical and graphical purposes and normalization of the (divergent over q \u2208 [1/2, \u221e])\ntruncated extended Bures volume element (Sec. VI), consider that q \u2208 [ 21 , 500].\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show the two-dimensional marginal volume element of (10) (after omission\nof the dqdr term) - integrating out the spherical angles, \u03b81 , \u03b82 , and leaving the radial\ncoordinate r and the escort parameter q.

Now, reversing arguments,\n\nSKL (pBq=1 trunc , pB ) = 0.0661775. (We use the natural logarithm, and not 2 as a base, with\n8\n\n\fone nat equalling 0.531 bits.) Let us convert - using Bayes' rule - these two (prior)\nprobability distributions to posterior probability distributions (postB and postBuresq=1 ), by\nassuming three pairs of spin measurements, one each in the x-, y- and z-direction, each pair\nyielding one \"up\" and one \"down\". This gives us the likelihood function (cf. [9, eq. (9)] [29,\neq. (4.2)]),\nL(x, y, z) =\n\n(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 y 2 )(1 \u2212 z 2 )\n64\n\n(16)\n\n(which we convert to the spherical coordinates (5) in which we perform our Mathematica\ncomputations).\nThen, we have SKL (postB ||pBq=1 trunc ) = 0.169782 and SKL (postBuresq=1 ||pB ) = 0.197657.\nThe relative magnitudes of the information gains obtained by passing from priors to posteriors (0.101846 to 0.169782 and 0.0661775 to 0.197657) seems to suggest that pB is somewhat\nmore noniformative than pBq=1 trunc . This is confirmed, using the testing structure given in\n1\n\n[11, 30] (cf. [9]), if we formally use a likelihood (L(x, y, z) 2 ), which is the square root of\n(16), to compute postB and postBuresq=1 . Then, we see a decrease in relative entropy from\n0.101846 to 0.093849 and an increase from 0.0661775 to 0.114669. So, pB can be made closer\nto pBq=1 trunc by adding information to it, but not vice versa, leading us to conclude that pB\nis more noninformative than pBq=1 trunc , since it assumes less about the data. (Let us note,\nhowever, that in the class of monotone metrics [16], the Bures or minimal monotone metric\nappears to be the least noninformative (cf. [13, sec. 5]). The maximal monotone metric, on\nthe other hand, is not normalizable to a proper prior probability distribution over the Bloch\nsphere [11]. So, there is an interesting question of whether there exists a single, distinguished\nnormalizable monotone metric which is maximally noninformative.)\n\nIV.\n\nFISHER INFORMATION METRIC OF HUSIMI DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nLet us now move to a classical context, employing the (generalized) Husimi distributions\n[31], rather than density matrices to represent the two-level quantum systems. Use of the\nFisher information (monotone) metric [32, 33] is now indicated. To generate the (properly\nnormalized) escort Husimi distributions (H{q} ) (cf. [23]), from the Husimi distribution (H =\nH{1} ), we employ the formula (cf. (9)),\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\nH{q} = 2 (r + q r) \u2212 (1 \u2212 r)1+q + (1 + r)1+q\nH q.\n9\n\n(17)\n\n\f0.1\nvol. elem\n0.05\n0\n0\n0.2\n\n500\n400\n300\n200q\n100\n\n0.4\n0.6\nr\n0.8\n1\n\nFIG. 6: Two-dimensional marginal of the four-dimensional extended Husimi volume element (21)\n\nThe tangential components of the Fisher information metric for the escort Husimi distributions (H{q} ) are of the form\n((1 + r)fFq (t))\u22121 , where [30, eq. (29)]\nfFq (t) =\n\n(\u22121 + q) (\u22121 + t)2 (\u22121 + t1+q )\n.\nq (1 + t) (1 \u2212 q + t + q t \u2212 tq \u2212 q tq \u2212 t1+q + q t1+q )\n\n(18)\n\nIn [30, sec. V.D], we succeeded in finding similarly general (for all q) formulas for the\ndenominators, but not the numerators, of the radial components.\nIn Fig. 6 we show (having to resort to some numerical integrations, since we lack explicit\n[q-general] expressions for certain of the metric elements) the counterpart to Fig. 3 for\nthe four-dimensional extended Husimi metric. Continuing with our numerical methods, we\nobtain the interesting unimodal curve (Fig. 7) - the peak being near q = 3.59782, with a\nvalue there of 0.448488. This portrays the one-dimensional marginal Husimi volume element\nover q (cf. Fig. 4). In Fig. 8 we show the (quite difficult-to-compute) one-dimensional\nmarginal over r (cf. Fig. 5). (It appears the upturn near r = 1 may be simply a numerical\nartifact. The difficulty consists in that, in some sense, we have to repeatedly perform\nnumerical integrations using results of other numerical integrations. It would be of interest\nto see how the curve changes as the range of q \u2208 [ 12 , 500] is modified.)\n\n10\n\n\fvol. elem\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nq\n\nFIG. 7: One-dimensional marginal over q of the four-dimensional extended Husimi volume element\n(21).

(2)]\n1\u2212r\n\u22122r \u2212 log( 1+r\n) 2 \u0010\n1 \u2212 r \u0011\u22121 2\ndr\n+\n(1\n+\nr)f\n(\n)\ndn .\ndsF (\u03c1, \u03c1 + d\u03c1) =\nF\n2r 3\n1+r\n2\n\nHere,\nfF (t) =\n\n(t \u2212 1)3\n,\nt2 \u2212 2t log t \u2212 1\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwhich is the limiting case (q \u2192 1) of (11). To normalize the volume element of this metric\n(19) to a prior probability distribution (pF ), we divide it by 1.39350989 [30].\n\n11\n\n\fB.\n\nFour-dimensional metric\n\nIn the extended (four-dimensional) case (cf. (14)), after having set q = 1, we have,\ndsFq=1 (\u03c1, \u03c1 + d\u03c1)2 =\n+\n\n\u00101\n\n4\n\n\u2212\n\n(\u22121 + r 2 )2 log2 W \u0011 2\ndq\n16r 2\n\n(21)\n\n2r \u2212 (\u22121 + r 2 ) log W\ndqdr + dsF (\u03c1, \u03c1 + d\u03c1)2 .\n2r 2\n\n(So, the metric tensor here, in the same manner as in the untruncated extended Bures case\n(10), is not fully diagonal. We do not truncate the q-extended Fisher information metric (21)\nin any of our analyses.) To normalize its (non-null) volume element to a prior probability\ndistribution (pFq=1 ) over the Bloch sphere, we must divide by 0.24559293.\n\nV.\n\nCOMPARATIVE NONINFORMATIVITY ANALYSIS\n\nWe have that SKL (pF ||pFq=1 ) = 0.229666 and SKL (pFq=1 ||pF ) = 0.170145. Further, using\nthe likelihood (16), based on six hypothetical measurements to generate posteriors, we obtain SKL (postF , pFq=1 ) = 0.70766 and SKL (postFq=1 ||pF ) = 0.0641738. So, the comparative\nnoninformativity test, which was initially developed by Clarke [10], leads us to a firm conclusion that the four-dimensional-based probability distribution pFq=1 is more noninformative\nin nature than the three-dimensional-based pF .\nAdditionally, SKL (pB ||pFq=1 ) = 0.148269 and SKL (pFq=1 ||pB ) = 0.0989669. These are\nconverted, respectively, to 0.283218 and 0.0842879 if we replace the first arguments of the\ntwo relative entropy functionals by posterior distributions based on the (formal) square root\n1\n\n(L(x, y, z) 2 ) of the likelihood function (16). Thus, we can conclude that pFq=1 is also more\nnoninformative than pB .\nFurther, SKL (pBq=1 trunc ||pFq=1 ) = 0.105463 and SKL (pFq=1 ||pBq=1 trunc ) = 0.0914175.\n1\n\nAgain, using the formal square root (L(x, y, z) 2 ) of the likelihood, we obtain changes, respectively, to 0.245602 and 0.0408236. So, our conclusion here is that pFq=1 is also more\nnoninformative than pBq=1 trunc . We already know from [30] that pB is considerably more\nnoninformative than pF .\nContinuing along these lines, SKL (pBq=1 trunc ||pF ) = 0.0191948 and SKL (pF ||pBq=1 trunc ) =\n1\n\n0.0234599 (so the two distributions are relatively close to one another). Using (L(x, y, z) 2 ) to\n\n12\n\n\fgenerate posterior distributions, the first statistic is altered (slightly decreased) to 0.0143147,\nwhile the second statistic jumps to 0.1047772.\nSo, assembling these several relative entropy statistics, we have the previously indicated\nordering of the four priors (1). (The conclusions of the comparative noninformativity test\nappear to be transitive in nature, although I can cite no explicit theorem to that effect.)\n\nA.\n\nRelation to Srednicki's Criterion for Priors\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show the one-dimensional marginal probabilities of the four prior probabilities over the radial coordinate r in the near-to-pure-state range r \u2208 [.995, 1]. The dominance\nordering in this plot fully complies with that (1) found by the information-theoretic-based\ncomparative noninformativity test. (We note that this ordering is not simply reversed near\nto the fully mixed state [r = 0].) Conjecturally, this could be seen as a specific case of some\n(yet unproven) theorem - perhaps utilizing the convexity and decreasing-under-positivemappings properties [34, p. 35] of the relative entropy functional.\nSo, the information-theoretic (comparative-noninformativity) test appears to incorporate\nSrednicki's criterion of \"biasedness to pure states\" [9]. (Of course, it would be interesting to\ntest the consistency between the comparative noninformativity test and Srednicki's criterion\nwith a larger number of priors, as well as in higher-dimensional quantum settings (cf. [35]).)\nSrednicki does not explicitly observe that increasing biasedness to pure states corresponds\nto increasing noninformativity. He asserts that \"we must decide how biased we are towards\npure states\".\nSrednicki focused on two possible priors. One was the uniform distribution over the\nBloch sphere (unit ball). In [11, sec. 2.2], we had concluded that this distribution was less\nnoninformative than pB , in full agreement with contemporaneous work of Hall [13]. The\nsecond prior (\"the Feynman measure\"), which Srednicki points out is less biased to the\npure states than the uniform distribution, was discussed in [36]. Neither of the two priors\nanalyzed by Srednicki corresponds to the normalized volume element of a monotone metric\n[11, 36].\n\n13\n\n\fVI.\n\nq-EXTENDED INFERENCE\n\nIn the setting of the q-parameterized escort density matrices (9), the factor\n\n1\u2212z 2\n4\n\nin the\n\nlikelihood (16), giving the probability (in the standard three-dimensional Bloch sphere setting) of one spin-up and one spin-down being measured in the z-direction, would be replaced\nby\nLq (z) =\n\nr 2 (1 + W q )2 \u2212 (\u22121 + W q )2 z 2\n,\n4r 2 (1 + W q )2\n\nand similarly for the x- and y-directions. (For q = 1, we recover\n\n(22)\n1\u2212z 2\n.)\n4\n\nIt would be interesting to ascertain if the volume elements of the extended fourdimensional (truncated) Bures and Husimi metrics ((10) and (21)) could be integrated\nover the product of the Bloch sphere and q \u2208 [ 21 , \u221e] and normalized to (prior) probability distributions. Then, using likelihoods incorporating the form (22), one could conduct\nthe comparative noninformativity test in a four-dimensional setting, rather than only the\nthree-dimensional one employed throughout this study. It turns out, however, that the threefold integral - holding q fixed - of the truncated volume element of (10) over the Bloch\nsphere is given by our formula (12). Therefore, the four-fold integral of the one-dimensional\nmarginal over the indicated product region with q \u2208 [ 21 , \u221e] must diverge. So, to achieve a\nproper probability distribution one would have to truncate q above a certain value.\nContinuing along these lines, we omitted q above 500 (and below q = 21 ) and normalized\nthe volume element of the (truncated) extended Bures metric to a proper probability distribution. Then, the information gain with respect to such a prior, using Lq (z), is 0.0597923\nnats of information, while a single up or down measurement yields 0.134651 nats, and two\nmeasurements along the same axis giving the same outcome leads to an information gain of\n0.349601. The analogous three (slightly larger) statistics, working in the unextended framework (where q does not explicitly enter, and is implicitly understood to equal 1), using pB\nas prior, are, respectively,\n\n7\n6\n\n\u2212 log 3 \u2248 0.0680544, and\n\n8 p Fq ({ 12 , 1, 2}, { 23 , 25 }, 1) \u2212 \u03c0 (\u22125 + log(64)) \u2212 6 \u2212 12 K\n\u2248 0.140186,\n6\u03c0\n\n(23)\n\n(where p Fq denotes a generalized hypergeometric function and K \u2248 0.915965594177 is Catalan's constant) and\n\n59\n30\n\n\u2212 log 5 \u2248 0.357229. (We encountered numerical difficulties using\n\nMathematica in attempting to extend these analyses to measurements conducted in more\nthan one direction, unless we restricted q to a range no larger than on the order of 10.)\n14\n\n\fOne might also consider the possible relevance of q-analogs of the Clarke comparative\nnoninformativity test, using q-relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler) divergence [37, 38].\n\nVII.\n\nq-EXTENDED BURES METRIC FOR HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL QUAN-\n\nTUM SCENARIOS\nA.\n\nFour-Variable 3 \u00d7 3 Density Matrices\n\nIn [35], we considered an extension of the 2 \u00d7 2 density matrices (4) to the 3 \u00d7 3 form\n(by incorporating an additional parameter v)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nv+z\n0\nx \u2212 iy\n\uf8f7\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1= \uf8ec 0\nr 2 = x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2264 v 2 ;\n2 \u2212 2v\n0 \uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n2\uf8ed\nx + iy\n0\nv\u2212z\n\n0 \u2264 v \u2264 1,\n\n(24)\n\nThe Bures metric was found there to take the form\ndBn=3 (\u03c1, \u03c1 + d\u03c1)2 =\n\nr2 \u2212 v\nr\nv\n1 2\u0011\n1\u0010\n2\n2\ndv\n+\ndvdr\n+\n+\ndr\n+\ndn .\n4 (1 \u2212 v)(r 2 \u2212 v 2 )\nr2 \u2212 v2\nv2 \u2212 r2\nv\n\n(25)\n\n(So, the tangential component is independent of r, as with (6) (cf.

In this regard, we turned our attention to the paper, \"Quantum entanglement\ninferred by the principle of maximum nonadditive entropy\" of Abe and Rajagopal [7] (cf.\n[8, eq. (14)]).\nTheir principal object of study is a 4 \u00d7 4 density matrix [7, eq.

(The\n\nto\n\nnumerical integration employed to generate Fig. 10 is more challenging - due to the necessary imposition of the Peres separability criterion - than to create Fig. 9, so we could not\nobtain as many significant digits.)\nThese q-invariance results stand in interesting contrast to the emphasis of Abe and Rajagopal \"that for q > 1, indicating the subadditive feature of the Tsallis entropy, the entan17\n\n\fBures sep. vol.\n0.3254\n0.3253\n0.3252\n0.3251\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nq\n\n0.3249\n\nFIG. 10: Numerical integration estimates of the Bures volume of the separable A two-qubit states,\nas a function of q.

But, in terms of the Bures metric (and others we will see below) the\nmeasure of the region does not change with q.\nUsing the Hilbert-Schmidt metric [42], rather than the Bures, we find that the volume\nof separable and nonseparable AR two-qubit states is equal to\n1 and the volume of separable states is equal to\n\n1\n\u221a\n8 2\n\n1\n\u221a\n4 2\n\nfor both q =\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\nfor both these values of q, so the\n\ncorresponding Hilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities are simply 12 . (If we employ either\nthe Wigner-Yanase [monotone] metric [43] or the arithmetic average [monotone] metric [41],\nthen, for q = 1, we obtain exactly the same [volume] results as using the Bures metric,\nand for q =\n\n1\n2\n\n- using numerical rather than symbolic methods in the Wigner-Yanase case\n\n- quite clearly the same also.) So, it certainly appears that the q-invariance of the total\nand separable volumes of the AR-states is metric-independent. Canosa and Rossignoli [44,\np. 4] have noted that for the AR-states, the \"final maximum entropy density is actually\nindependent of the choice of f \", where f is a smooth concave function.\nThe Bures separability probability (as well as that based on the Wigner-Yanase metric)\nof the (one-parameter) \"Jaynes state\" [1, 3], in which (unlike the AR-states) no constraint\non the dispersion is present (and q is implicitly equal to 1) , is\n\n\u221a\n2 arcsin( 2\u22121)\n\u03c0\n\n\u2248 0.271887.\n\n(Again, note the presence of the silver mean - and implicitly in the very next formula.)\n\n18\n\n\fThe Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability is\n\u221a \u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\nsinh\u22121 2 \u2212 2 + Root #14 \u2212 148#12 + 68&, 3\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a\n\u2248 0.343602.\n6 + sinh\u22121\n2\n\n(32)\n\nhave to perform the transformation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n2\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\n4 8b21 + (\u03c3 21 )\n8b 1 \u03c3 21\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c312 \u2192 2\n,\nb\n\u2192\n.\n1\n2\n2\n\uf8f3\n4b 1 + (\u03c3 21 ) \u2212 8\u03c3 21 + 32\n4b21 + (\u03c3 21 ) \u2212 8\u03c3 21 + 32 \uf8fe\n\n(33)\n\nTo convert from the AR two-qubit density matrix for q = 1 to that for q = 21 , we merely\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nPresumably, there is a (more complicated, in general) transformation between AR-states for\nany pair of distinct values of q. So, in retrospect, the q-invariance of the (Bures, HilbertSchmidt, Wigner-Yanase and arithmetic average) metric volumes is not so surprising, since\nwe are simply working within one family of two-parameter density matrices, the various\nq-manifestations of which can be obtained by suitable reparameterizations. Similarly, the\nnull nature of the q-extended Bures metric for the AR-states can be seen in this light.\n\n2.\n\nTrivariate Jaynes state using generalized Bell-CHSH observables\n\nIt would be interesting to extend and analyze the AR-states based on modifications of the\nBell-CHSH observable (cf. [2, sec. 3] [45]). In fact, we pursued such a line of investigation,\nusing\n\n\u221a\nB\u03b1 = 2 2(|\u03a6+ ih\u03a6+ | \u2212 \u03b1|\u03a8\u2212 ih\u03a8\u2212 |),\n\n(34)\n\nas the observable, where for \u03b1 = 1, we recover the Bell-CHSH observable employed by\nAbe and Rajagopal [7, eq. (6)] (cf. [2, eq. (15)]). (We utilized the Jaynes maximum\nentropy strategy [3], implicitly taking q = 1 - so, most precisely, we are extending the\nmodel discussed by Rajagopal in [1] to incorporate generalized Bell-CHSH observables or,\nalternatively, the Canosa-Rossignoli model to included the dispersion.) Then, the volume\nelement of the Bures metric, considering \u03b1 as a parameter, in addition to the expectation\nb1 and the dispersion \u03c31 , was null. Considering, on the other hand, \u03b1 to be simply a fixed\nq\n1\n1\nconstant, the bivariate Bures volume element was of the (non-null) form 4 C+D\ndb1 d\u03c312 ,\nwhere\n\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u0001\nC = 8\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c312 (\u03c312 )2 \u2212 4 2(\u03b1 \u2212 1)b1 \u03c312 \u2212 4\u03b1 \u03c312 +\n19\n\n(35)\n\n\fand\n\n\u221a\nD = 16 2(\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03b1b31 \u2212 8b21\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c312 + 8 \u03b12 \u2212 3\u03c312 \u03b1 + \u03c312 .\n\nFor \u03b1 = 1, we recover (30), so the associated Bures separability probability is the silver\nmean. For \u03b1 = 1, using the HS-metric now, the total volume of states is\nthe separable states is\n\n1\n\u221a\n,\n8 2\n\n1\n\u221a\n4 2\n\nand that of\n\nso the HS separability probability is simply 12 .\n\nFor the case \u03b1 = 2, we obtained a result of 0.35368 for the Bures volume of separable and\nnonseparable states, and 0.2000322 for the Bures volume of only separable states, yielding\na separability probability of 0.566392.

We can see that the associated HS separability\nprobability is the silver mean.\n\nC.\n\nTsallis-Lloyd-Baranger Two-Qubit States\n\nTsallis, Lloyd and Baranger have considered a scenario in which the probabilities of\nbeing in either one of the four states of the Bell basis is given in the form\n22\n\n(1\u2212x) (1\u2212y) (1\u2212z)\n, 4 , 4\n4\n\n\fand\n\n(1+x+y+z)\n4\n\n[8]. (The feasible points (x, y, z) lie in a certain tetrahedron [8, Fig. 3].)\n\nThey also embed their three-parameter (two-qubit) 4 \u00d7 4 density matrix [8, eq. (12)] into\nan (unnormalized) four-parameter 4 \u00d7 4 density matrix [8, eq. (14)] by introducing the\nq-parameter.\nUpon its normalization and application of the H\u00fcbner formula (3), we obtained the\ncorresponding Bures metric, the volume element of which, in a numerical investigation,\nappeared to be zero, in this four-parameter extended case. So, we have, to this point, yet\nto find any nondegenerate q-extension of the Bures metric (if one is so possible).\nIn the unextended three-parameter case, if we employ new coordinates of the form,\nx = 1 \u2212 4 cos \u03b81 , y = 1 \u2212 4 sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 , z = 1 \u2212 4 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 cos \u03b83 ,\n\n(39)\n\nthen we have simply\ndT LB (\u03c1, \u03c1 + d\u03c1)2 = d\u03b812 + sin \u03b81 2 d\u03b822 + sin \u03b81 2 sin \u03b82 2 d\u03b832 ,\n\n(40)\n\nthat is, the uniform metric on the 3-sphere.\nThe Bures volume of the (separable and nonseparable) TLB-states is\n\n\u03c02\n,\n8\n\nwhile the Bures\n\nvolume of just the separable states themselves is (thanks to a challenging computation -\ninvolving a cylindrical algebraic decomposition [cad] [46] - performed by M. Trott)\n\n\u03c0(4\u2212\u03c0)\n.\n8\n\n(The separable states comprise the cube x, y, z \u2208 [\u22121, 13 ].) Thus, the Bures separability\nprobability [39, 40, 41] of the TLB-states is (quite elegantly)\n\n4\u2212\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n\u2248 0.27324.\n\nFor the Hilbert-Schmidt metric, the volume of the TLB (separable and nonseparable)\nstates is\n\nVIII.\n\n1\n\u221a\n6 2\n\nand that of the separable states,\n\n1\u221a\n,\n12 2\n\nso the HS separability probability is 12 .\n\nRAJAGOPAL-ABE METRIC\n\nWe also investigated the possible application of the \"generalized 'metric\" (based on the qKullback-Leibler entropy) [47, eq. (16)] to the two-level quantum systems (4) - and seeing\nhow it pertains to the family of quantum monotone metrics [16]. For the case q = 1 (which\nshould reduce to the Kullback-Leibler symmetrized divergence [47, eq. (6)], our calculations\nyielded that the diagonal elements of the \"metric\" take the form\n\u0011\nr\n1\n1\u0010\n\u2212 log (\u2212\n) + log W dr 2 \u2212 r(3 + cos 2\u03b81 + 2 sin 2\u03b81 ) log W d\u03b812\n2\n2+r\n4\n23\n\n(41)\n\n\f1\n\u2212 r(3 + cos 2\u03b82 + 2 sin 2\u03b82 ) log W sin2 \u03b81 d\u03b812 ,\n4\nwhere, as we recall, W =\n\n1\u2212r\n.\n1+r\n\nSo, it clearly can not possess the form required of a quantum\n\nmonotone metric (cf. Sec. III A). However, when we attempted to implement equation (6)\nof ([47]), bypassing the q-framework, we obtained for the (presumably same?) metric\n1\n1\ndr 2 \u2212\nlog W dn2 ,\n2\n1\u2212r\n2r\n\n(42)\n\nwhich does not appear to correspond to a monotone metric.\n\nIX.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nNaudts [22] introduced the concept of a \u03c6-exponential family of density operators \u03c1\u03b8\n(for which the obvious example is \u03c6(u) = uq ). He showed that the \u03c6-exponential family of\ndensity operators, together with a family of escort density operators, optimizes a generalized\nversion of the well-known Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound. He assumes that certain Hamiltonians\nare two-by-two commuting. Therefore, the quantum information manifold (\u03c1\u03b8 )\u03b8 is abelian,\nwhich \"is clearly too restrictive for a fully quantum-mechanical theory\". He suggests further\nwork to remove this restriction.\nAbe regarded the order of the escort distribution q as a parameter [48]. He studied\nthe geometric structure of the one-parameter family of escort distributions using the Kullback divergence, and showed that the Fisher metric is given in terms of the generalized bit\nvariance, which measures fluctuations of the crowding index of a multifractal.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI wish to express gratitude to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) for\ncomputational support in this research and to Michael Trott of Wolfram Research Inc. for\nhis generous willingness/expertise in assisting with Mathematica computations.\n\n[1] A.
