We summarize our knowledge about the Xray source populations in the MCs from past missions and\npresent first results from systematic studies of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) using the growing number of\narchival XMM-Newton observations.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe study of X-ray source populations and diffuse X-ray\nemission in nearby galaxies is of major importance in understanding the X-ray output of more distant galaxies as\nwell as learning about processes that occur on interstellar scales within our own Galaxy. The MCs, satellites of\nthe Milky Way, show different chemical compositions, are\nirregular in shape, and are heavily interacting with the\nMilky Way. This influences the process of star formation\nand the study of stellar populations in the MCs is particularly rewarding. Their proximity makes the MCs the\nideal galaxies for X-ray studies.\nPrevious X-ray surveys of the MCs, which were\nperformed with the imaging instruments of the Einstein, ASCA and ROSAT satellites, revealed discrete Xray sources and large-scale diffuse emission. The early\nEinstein observations unveiled more than one hundred\npoint-like sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC;\nLong et al., 1981; Wang et al., 1991) and seventy in the\nSMC (Wang & Wu, 1992). ASCA found more than 100\nsources and detected coherent pulsations from 17 sources\nin the SMC (Yokogawa et al., 2003). In particular the\nhigh sensitivity and the large field of view of the ROSAT\n\nPSPC provided the most comprehensive catalogues of discrete X-ray sources in the directions of the LMC (758 in\nan area of \u223c59 square degrees; Haberl & Pietsch, 1999)\nand the SMC (517 in an area of \u223c18 square degrees;\nHaberl et al., 2000). Together with ROSAT HRI observations this yielded about 1000 and 550 X-ray sources in the\nareas of the LMC and SMC, respectively (Sasaki et al.,\n2000a,b). A spectral analysis of the emission from the\nhot thin plasma in the interstellar medium (ISM) using\nROSAT PSPC data of the MCs revealed temperatures\nbetween 106 and 107 K (Sasaki et al., 2002).\nComplementary deep surveys at other wavelengths\nwere carried out by, e.g., Galex (UV) and Spitzer (IR),\ntogether with ground-based observations of H\u03b1, H I and\nradio continuum. In the optical/NIR bands the principal large scale digital surveys of the MCs are the microlensing surveys (MACHO and OGLE), the bright star\nsurvey of Massey (2002), the MCPS Magellanic Clouds\nPhotometric Survey (Zaritsky et al., 2002) and the DENIS and 2MASS near infra-red surveys. Combining the\navailable information from the different wavelength bands\nallows to characterize the properties of different X-ray\nsource classes like supernova remnants (SNRs), high and\nlow mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs, LMXBs) and supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) and differentiate them from\nbackground sources (mainly active galactic nuclei, AGN)\nor foreground stars. For the classification of sources Xray spectral information (hardness ratios), X-ray to optical flux ratio, angular extent and flux variability can\nbe used (e.g., Haberl et al., 2000; Yokogawa et al., 2003;\nShtykovskiy & Gilfanov, 2005; McGowan et al., 2007a,b).\nThis has also been demonstrated for other Local\nGroup galaxies like M31 (Pietsch et al., 2005b) and M33\n(Pietsch et al., 2004).\n2. Source populations\nThe SMC is very rich in HMXBs, which can be used as\ntracers of recent star formation in the galaxy. The evolutionary age of these early type binary systems is low\n(Grimm et al., 2003) and most of the Be-HMXBs in the\nSMC are found in regions with young (20\u221250 Myr) stellar\n\n\f2\n\nF. Haberl & W. Pietsch: X-ray source populations in the Magellanic Clouds\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of the pulse period distribution of HMXB pulsars in the Milky Way and the SMC. Despite the\nlarge difference in galaxy mass, nearly as many HMXB pulsars are known (status beginning of 2006) in the Milky\nWay (53) and the SMC (46). In both galaxies most of the pulsars are found with spin periods between 100 s and 1000\ns. The fraction of pulsars with spin periods between 1 s and 100 s is slightly higher in the SMC as compared to the\nMilky Way.\npopulations (Shtykovskiy & Gilfanov, 2007). About fifty\nHMXB pulsars are now known in the SMC together with\nmany more candidates which exhibit similar X-ray properties, but yet without detected pulsations which reveal\nthe spin period of a neutron star (e.g., Haberl & Sasaki,\n2000; Haberl & Pietsch, 2004). Such a large number of\nHMXBs can be used for statistical studies, e.g. for a comparison with the HMXB population in the Milky Way (see\nFig. 1). In nearly all cases in the SMC the mass donor\nstar is a Be star (Coe et al., 2005) with a circum-stellar\ndisc (Okazaki & Negueruela, 2001). When the binary orbit is wide and eccentric, the passage of the neutron star\nclose to the disc results in X-ray outbursts and a transient\nbehaviour of the Be-HMXBs. Many of the Be-HMXBs in\nthe SMC were discovered during outburst (often exceeding\n1037 erg s\u22121 in X-ray luminosity), in particular with ASCA\n(Yokogawa et al., 2003) and RXTE (for results from a regular monitoring of the SMC see Laycock et al., 2005).\nThe X-ray spectra of many HMXBs show, in addition to the typical power-law, a low-energy emission component. The origin of this soft excess is not clear yet\n(Hickox et al., 2004). The Be-HMXBs in the SMC are ideally suited to investigate the soft part of their spectra due\nto the low foreground absorption, in contrast to HMXBs\nin the Milky Way which are mainly found in the galactic\nplane suffering high absorption. The best case to study\nthe soft spectral component so far is probably the BeHMXB RX J0103.6\u22127201 (with 1323 s the pulsar with the\nlongest period known in the SMC) which showed during\none XMM-Newton observation a highly absorbed powerlaw component and a completely disentangled soft component. The soft component can be reproduced by thermal\nplasma emission with its luminosity strongly correlated\n\nwith the total intrinsic source luminosity, suggesting that\nthe same mechanism is responsible for the generation of\nthe soft emission (Haberl & Pietsch, 2005).\nLuminous super-soft X-ray sources were discovered\nwith the Einstein observatory (CAL 83 and CAL 87) and\nwere established as a new class of X-ray binaries after the\nROSAT discoveries of five new such objects in the LMC\n(Kahabka et al., 1994; Greiner, 1996). SSSs exhibit very\nsoft X-ray spectra (characteristic temperatures kT of a\nfew tens of eV) and show a variety of intensity variations\non different time scales (little variations, slow exponential decay over years, transient outbursts, off-states). The\nmost popular model for SSS involves nuclear burning on\nthe surface of an accreting white dwarf (WD) which can\nexplain the observed luminosities (van den Heuvel et al.,\n1992; Kahabka & van den Heuvel, 1997). The WDs in SSS\nindicate an older population consistent with their distribution mainly in the outer parts of the MCs. After the detection in the MCs, SSSs were also found in other local group\ngalaxies. Interestingly the majority of SSSs in M31 was\nidentified with optical novae (Pietsch et al., 2005a) which\nenter a SSS state some time after optical outburst with\nonset and duration of the SSS state varying strongly from\nsource to source. The MCs are sufficiently close to detect\nSSSs at low luminosities which allows us to address the\nquestion if permanently low-luminosity (too low for the\nhigh accretion rates inferred from the models) SSSs exist,\nor if they are highly variable which could point to unstable\nnuclear burning. XMM-Newton observations of faint SSSs\nin MC fields show that this class is composed of very different objects (Kahabka & Haberl, 2006; Kahabka et al.,\n2006; Orio et al., 2007; Kahabka et al., 2008). Symbiotic\nstars, central stars of planetary nebulae and even a Be star\n\n\fF. Haberl & W. Pietsch: X-ray source populations in the Magellanic Clouds\n\n(Kahabka et al., 2006) were identified as optical counterparts. Be/WD systems are predicted to be more numerous\nthan Be/neutron star binaries and the fact that we have\nso far not discovered any clear Be/WD case needs to be\nexplained by binary evolution models.\nSNRs are a major source of matter feedback into\nthe ISM. Supernova explosions correlated in space and\ntime generate super-bubbles (SBs) typically hundreds of\nparsecs in extent. SNRs and SBs are among the prime\ndrivers controlling the morphology and the evolution of\nthe ISM. A synoptic study of thirteen SMC SNRs observed\nby XMM-Newton (van der Heyden et al., 2004) showed a\nrange of different morphological features from shell-like to\nmore irregular structures. A spectral analysis with singletemperature non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) and Sedov\nmodels revealed the different evolutionary phases of the\nremnants.\n3. XMM-Newton observations of the SMC\nUp to now, no complete X-ray survey of the SMC exists\nwith the currently operating large observatories Chandra\nor XMM-Newton. A partial survey concentrating on the\nEastern Wing (McGowan et al., 2007a), was performed by\nChandra. These observations covered areas in the outer\nparts of the SMC, and the majority of the 523 detected\nsources were identified as AGN, while the abundance of\nHMXBs (four detected pulsars) is low compared to the\nSMC Bar (McGowan et al., 2007b). XMM-Newton observations were dedicated to various individual targets in the\nSMC resulting in a very inhomogeneous coverage. In a\nfirst attempt to derive the luminosity function of HMXBs\nin the SMC, Shtykovskiy & Gilfanov (2005) analyzed the\n(mainly EPIC-MOS) 2\u22128 keV data of nine observations\nand compared the observed number of HMXBs with predictions based on star formation rate (SFR) estimates.\nDepending on the SFR indicators used, the abundance of\nSMC HMXBs can be consistent with that of the Milky\nWay and other nearby galaxies or as much as a factor of\nten higher.\nMeanwhile many more XMM-Newton observations are\navailable in the direction of the SMC. To obtain an interim XMM-Newton view of the SMC we systematically\nanalyzed all available EPIC data (the pn camera either in\nfull frame (FF), extended full frame (eFF) or large window\n(LW) mode). This includes eight own proprietary observations from AO5 and AO6 together with all public archival\ndata. After removing three observations which suffered\nfrom very high background, there remain 38 observations\nwhich we used for our analysis. Fourteen of them are calibration observations in the direction of 1E 0102.2-7219\nwhich accumulate to a deep exposure in the north-eastern\nregion. A mosaic RGB colour image is presented in Fig. 2\nwhich is produced from 38 pointings which mainly cover\nthe Bar and the Eastern Wing of the SMC (three observations are pointed further south around the RS CVn type\n\n3\n\nvariable CF Tuc). The image includes data from four observations with slightly increased background which are\nnot well suited for a clean image and the analysis of diffuse emission, but can still be used for the analysis of point\nsources. In the following we present a few examples of our\nfirst results with the emphasis on SNRs and HMXBs.\nThree additional known SNRs \u2013 SNR B0039\u221273.9\n= HFPK 530 (Filipovic et al., 1998; Haberl et al.,\n2000; Payne et al., 2007), SNR B0050\u221272.8 and\nSNR B0058\u221271.8 (Mathewson et al., 1984) \u2013 are covered\nby new XMM-Newton observations. This allows to extend\nthe investigations of SMC SNRs by van der Heyden et al.\n(2004). The three SNRs are located outside the main\nstar forming regions where the majority of SNRs is\nfound (north-east and south-west ends of the SMC Bar,\nsee Dickel et al., 2001; van der Heyden et al., 2004).\nAll three show irregular X-ray morphologies with low\nsurface brightness. An analysis of the X-ray spectra with\na single-temperature NEI model reveals relatively low\ntemperatures around kT = 0.18 keV, suggesting that\nthese are older remnants.\nA new candidate SNR is proposed from its X-ray\ncolours. It was already detected by Haberl et al. (2000)\nin ROSAT PSPC data (source 334 in their catalogue is\nlisted with an extent of \u223c 18\u2032\u2032 and correlates with a radio\nsource, consistent with emission from a SNR) and following van der Heyden et al. (2004) we name it HFPK 334.\nFilipovic et al. (2008, in preparation) will present multiwavelength morphological studies and more detailed results from the X-ray spectral analysis of the three SNRs,\nmentioned above, and the new candidate.\nThe X-ray transient XTE J0103-728, discovered as 6.85\ns pulsar by RXTE, was seen in outburst at a 0.2\u221210 keV\nluminosity of 1.6\u00d71037 erg s\u22121 in October 2006. The EPIC\ndata allowed us to accurately locate the source and to investigate its temporal and spectral behaviour. The identification with a Be star confirms XTE J0103-728 as Be/Xray binary in the SMC (Haberl et al., 2007). At least four\nnew HMXB pulsars (Haberl et al. 2008, in preparation)\nare discovered. Their optical counterparts are identified\nwith stars in the optical SMC surveys which show optical\nbrightness and colours consistent with Be stars.\nWe performed a systematic source detection on the images obtained from the individual observations (five energy bands for each of the three EPIC instruments). In\ntotal more than 1650 detections were obtained from the\n38 analyzed observations. This results in about 1060 individual sources. The total detection list can be used for\ntime variability studies for about 200 sources which are\ndetected more than once. The faintest sources have count\nrates as low as 1.3\u00d710\u22123 cts s\u22121 (0.2\u22124.5 keV) in comparison to the brightest source (the SNR 1E 0102.2-7219)\nwith a pn count rate of 31 cts s\u22121 . Assuming a canonical\nHMXB spectrum (photon index 1.0, absorption column\ndensity 1021 cm\u22122 ) this translates into a typical flux limit\n(for detection) of 3.7\u00d710\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 or a source lu-\n\n\f4\n\nF.

The observations used for this image accumulate\nto a maximum exposure of 210 ks (EPIC-pn) and 250 ks (EPIC-MOS) west of the SNR. Typical exposures in other\nareas are 10\u221220 ks.\n\n\fF.

Left: V magnitude of the optical counterpart\nplotted versus hardness ratio 2 (restricted to sources with errors on HR2 smaller than 0.25). X-ray sources which\nare detected in different observations may appear several times with different HR2 but the same counterpart (V\nmagnitude). Known HMXBs are marked with squares, AGN with x. Only very few AGN (two in the plots) behind\nthe observed SMC fields are as optically bright as HMXBs. Right: Comparison of B\u2212V and U\u2212B colour indices for\nthe optical counterparts of the X-ray sources. Known HMXBs in the SMC show typical V magnitudes of 14\u221216 and\nare closely concentrated in a small area in the optical colour-colour diagram.\nminosity of 1.8\u00d71033 erg s\u22121 for a distance of 60 kpc to\nthe SMC. With this limit, the subclass of persistent BeHMXBs which shows typical luminosities of around 1034\nerg s\u22121 can easily be detected and also it should be possible to detect the first cataclysmic variables in the SMC\nwhen they are in bright state (e.g. GK Per was observed\nwith \u223c1034 erg s\u22121 in outburst during EXOSAT observations; Watson et al., 1985).\nSource classifications using hardness ratios and optical\ninformation can be used to separate different source types\nand disentangle the SMC source populations from foreground stars and background AGN. In order to identify\npossible optical counterparts with high confidence, systematic uncertainties in the EPIC X-ray positions need to\nbe reduced. This work is currently in progress by registering the positions of X-ray sources in individual pointings to an optical coordinate frame using sources with well\nknown counterparts. For this purpose the large number of\nHMXBs and the increasing number of quasars can be used\nthat are known behind the SMC (see Geha et al., 2003;\nDobrzycki et al., 2005, and references therein). First results show that the systematic uncertainties in the EPIC\npositions can be reduced from typically 2-3\u2032\u2032 to about 1\u2032\u2032 .\nAs example to classify new HMXB candidates we correlated our EPIC detection list (in a preliminary way\nwith unregistered X-ray coordinates) with the optical catalogue of Massey (2002). The X-ray spectra of HMXBs in\nthe SMC are usually characterized by a hard power-law\nwith a relatively narrow distribution of the photon index\n\n(Haberl & Pietsch, 2004). Therefore, the hardness ratio 2\n(HR2) value is expected to cover a well defined range. Also\ntheir optical counterparts, in the SMC mainly Be stars,\nshow similar brightness and optical colours (Coe et al.,\n2005). In this way we can define areas in parameter space\nwhere sources of given nature (in this case HMXBs) are\nlikely to be found. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the\nX-ray HR2 with V magnitude of their optical counterparts. The optical B\u2212V and U\u2212B colours (from Massey,\n2002) of the optical counterparts are also presented in\nFig. 3. As expected the known HMXBs cover well defined\nlocations in these diagrams and new candidate HMXBs\ncan be selected (for similar and additional selection criteria and methods see e.g. Shtykovskiy & Gilfanov, 2005;\nMcGowan et al., 2007b).\n\n4. Conclusions\nFirst results from systematic analyses of X-ray data of the\nSMC obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton demonstrate the prospects for X-ray source population studies\nof the Magellanic Clouds, but also show the demand for a\ncomplete survey. The full LMC is probably too large to be\ncompletely covered by the relatively small field of view of\nmodern instruments in an acceptable number of observations. In the SMC up to now, particularly the outer regions\nwith older stellar populations and the area of the Eastern\nWing are only sparsely covered by XMM-Newton observations. Full coverage is highly desired to derive complete\n\n\f6\n\nF. Haberl & W. Pietsch: X-ray source populations in the Magellanic Clouds\n\nsource samples, probing areas of different stellar ages.\nLarge-scale structures in the diffuse emission can only be\ninvestigated in a full survey. EPIC observations with relatively moderate exposure are sensitive down to \u223c2\u00d71033\nerg s\u22121 for point sources in the SMC. First results from\nstudies of archival data demonstrate that one will be able\nto characterize individual X-ray sources by their time variability and spectrum, if they are bright enough, and identify and/or classify the sources using hardness ratios, longterm variability, source extent, and information from other\nwavelengths.\nAcknowledgements.
