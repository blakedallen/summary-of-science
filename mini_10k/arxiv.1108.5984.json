The article accompanies my talk at A celebration of algebraic geometry at Harvard\nin honor of the 60th birthday of J. Harris.\nA. Moduli spaces of curves\nLet Mg be the moduli space of compact nonsingular curves over C\nof genus g. We view Mg as a nonsingular Deligne-Mumford stack of\ndimension 3g \u2212 3. We will consider the spaces\n(1)\n\nMg \u2282 Mcg \u2282 Mg .\n\nHere, Mcg is the moduli space of curves of compact type (curves with\nno cycles in the dual graph). While Mg and Mcg are open, the moduli\nspace of stable curves Mg is compact. The Chow rings of the moduli\nspaces (1) are well-defined. Because of stack considerations, we will\ntake the Chow rings with Q-coefficients.\nFor the investigation of the \u03ba classes, the moduli spaces of curves\nwith markings\nc\nMrt\ng,n \u2282 Mg,n \u2282 Mg,n .\n\nplay an essential role and should be treated on the same footing. The\nmoduli space Mrt\ng,n of curves with rational tails is the inverse image of\nMg under the forgetful map\nMg,n \u2192 Mg .\n1\n\n\f2\n\nB. \u03ba classes\nThe \u03ba classes in the Chow ring A\u2217 (Mg,n ) are defined by the following\ngeometry. Let\n\u01eb : Mg,n+1 \u2192 Mg,n\nbe the universal curve viewed as the (n + 1)-pointed space, let\nLn+1 \u2192 Mg,n+1\nbe the line bundle obtained from the cotangent space of the last marking, and let\n\u03c8n+1 = c1 (Ln+1 ) \u2208 A1 (Mg,n+1 )\nbe the Chern class. The \u03ba classes, first defined by Mumford, are\ni+1\n\u03bai = \u01eb\u2217 (\u03c8n+1\n) \u2208 Ai (Mg,n ),\n\ni\u22650.\n\nThe simplest is \u03ba0 which equals 2g \u2212 2 + n times the unit in A0 (Mg,n ).\nThe convention\n0\n\u03ba\u22121 = \u01eb\u2217 (\u03c8n+1\n)=0\n\nis often convenient.\nc\nThe \u03ba classes on Mrt\ng,n and Mg,n are defined via restriction from\nMg,n . Define the \u03ba rings\n\u2217\nrt\n\u03ba\u2217 (Mrt\ng,n ) \u2282 A (Mg,n ),\n\n\u03ba\u2217 (Mcg,n ) \u2282 A\u2217 (Mcg,n ),\n\u03ba\u2217 (Mg,n ) \u2282 A\u2217 (Mg,n ),\nto be the Q-subalgebras generated by the \u03ba classes. Of course, the \u03ba\nrings are graded by degree.\nSince \u03bai is a tautological class the \u03ba rings are subalgebras of the\ncorresponding tautological rings. For unpointed nonsingular curves,\nthe \u03ba ring equals the tautological ring by definition [10],\n\u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) = R\u2217 (Mg ) .\nOtherwise, the inclusion of the \u03ba ring in the tautological ring is usually\nproper.\n\n\f3\n\nC. Mg and the Faber-Zagier conjecture\nConsider first the ring \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ). The basic non-vanishing and vanishing results,\n\u03bag\u22122 (Mg ) \u223c\n= Q,\n\n\u03ba>g\u22122 (Mg ) = 0\n\nhave been known now for some time [2, 7]. Moreover, there are no\nrelations [1] among the \u03ba classes of degree less than or equal to \u230a g3 \u230b,\nand the classes\n\u03ba1 , . . . , \u03ba\u230a g3 \u230b\ngenerate \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) [6, 9]. These properties had all been conjectured\nearlier by Faber [2].\nWe define a set of relations as follows. Let\np = { p1 , p3 , p4 , p6 , p7 , p9 , p10 , . . . }\nbe a variable set indexed by positive integers not congruent to 2 mod\n3. Let\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03a8(t, p) = (1 + tp3 + t p6 + t p9 + . . .)\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=0\n\n(6i)! i\nt\n(3i)!(2i)!\n\n2\n\n+ (p1 + tp4 + t p7 + . . .)\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=0\n\n(6i)! 6i + 1 i\nt .\n(3i)!(2i)! 6i \u2212 1\n\nDefine the constants C r (\u03c3) by the formula\nlog(\u03a8) =\n\n\u221e\nXX\n\u03c3\n\nC r (\u03c3) tr p\u03c3 .\n\nr=0\n\nHere, \u03c3 denotes a partition of size |\u03c3| which avoids all parts congruent\nto 2 mod 3. If \u03c3 = 1n1 3n3 4n4 . . ., then p\u03c3 = pn1 1 pn3 3 pn4 4 . . . as usual. Let\n\u03b3=\n\n\u221e\nXX\n\u03c3\n\nC r (\u03c3) \u03bar tr p\u03c3 .\n\nr=0\n\nTheorem 1. In \u03bar (Mg ), the relation\n\u0002\n\u0003\nexp(\u2212\u03b3) tr p\u03c3 = 0\nholds when g \u2212 1 + |\u03c3| < 3r and g \u2261 r + |\u03c3| + 1 mod 2.\n\n\f4\n\nThe relations of Theorem 1, called the FZ relations, were conjectured\nto hold several years ago by Faber and Zagier from low genus data and a\nstudy of the Gorenstein quotient of \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ). Guessing the full structure\nhere was certainly a remarkable feat. Theorem 1 was proven by myself\nand A. Pixton [13] last year using the geometry of stable quotients [8].\nTo the best of our knowledge, a relation in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) which is not in the\nspan of the FZ relations has not yet been found. In particular, all relations obtained from the various geometrical constructions attempted\nin the past [2] appear to be covered by Theorem 1. Whether Theorem\n1 exhausts all relations in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) is a very interesting question.\nQ1. Are all relations among the \u03ba classes in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) generated by\nTheorem 1?\nTheorem 1 only provides finitely many relations in \u03bar (Mg ) for fixed\ng and r, and thus may be calculated completely. When the relations\nyield a Gorenstein ring with socle in \u03bag\u22122 (Mg ), no further relations are\npossible. However, the relations of Theorem 1 do not always yield such\na Gorenstein ring (failing first in genus 24 as checked by Faber). For\ng < 24, Faber's calculations show Theorem 1 does provide all relations\nin \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ). For higher genus g \u2265 24, either Theorem 1 fails to provide\nall the relations in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) or \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) is not Gorenstein.\nQ2. Is \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) a Gorenstein ring with socle in degree g \u2212 2?\nFaber's original conjecture [2] asserts an affirmative answer to Q2.\nQuestions Q1 and Q2 can not both have an affirmative answer in genus\n24. Which assertion is false?\nThe main actors in the FZ relations are the functions\n\u221e\nX\n(6i)! \u0010 z \u0011i\n,\nA(z) =\n(3i)!(2i)! 72\ni=0\n\u221e\nX\n(6i)! 6i + 1 \u0010 z \u0011i\nB(z) =\n(3i)!(2i)! 6i \u2212 1 72\ni=0\nwritten here in the variable z = 72t. The function B is determined\nfrom A by the differential equation\ndA\n1\n1\n= B.\n\u2212 A + zA + 6z 2\n2\ndz\n2\n\n\f5\n\nThe main hypergeometric differential equation satisfied by A is\nd\nd2\n(2)\n36z 2 2 A + (72z \u2212 6) A + 5A = 0 .\ndz\ndz\nA more open ended question is following.\nQ3. What is the meaning of the function A? Does A or the\ndifferential equation (2) occur elsewhere in mathematics?\nThe statement of Theorem 1 contains a peculiar mod 2 condition.\nAs a consequence, the relations in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg ) given by Theorem 1 also\nhold in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg\u22122 ). Note \u03ba0 specializes to 2g \u2212 2 in genus g and 2g \u2212 6\nin genus g \u2212 2 ! In our proof [13] of Theorem 1, the mod 2 condition\narises (after a considerable amount of work) from the 2 fixed points of\nC\u2217 on P1 .\nQ4. Is there a simple explanation of the mod 2 condition?\nWe can also ask about relations on the moduli space Mrt\ng,n with\nmarkings. A. Pixton has a precise proposal for the n = 1 case in the\nform of Theorem 1. Work here is just starting and will be reported by\nPixton elsewhere.\n\n\f6\nc\nD. Universality for Mg,n\n\nConsider next the ring \u03ba\u2217 (Mcg,n ). The basic non-vanishing and vanishing results,\n\u03ba2g\u22123+n (Mcg,n ) \u223c\n= Q,\n\n\u03ba>2g\u22123+n (Mcg,n ) = 0\n\nhave been proven in [4, 5]. The classes\n\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 , . . . , \u03bag\u22121+\u230a n2 \u230b\ngenerate \u03ba\u2217 (Mcg,n ). If n > 0, there are no relations of degree less than\nor equal to g \u2212 1 + \u230a n2 \u230b. In \u03ba\u2217 (Mcg ), there are no relations of degree\nless than g \u2212 1 (whether degree g \u2212 1 relations can occur is not known).\nThe proofs of the above generation and freeness results can be found\nin [12].\nA surprising feature about the \u03ba rings in the compact type case is\nthe following universality result proven in [12].\nTheorem 2. Let g > 0 and n > 0, then the assignment \u03bai 7\u2192 \u03bai\nextends to a ring isomorphism\nc\nc\n).\n\u03b9 : \u03ba\u2217 (Mg\u22121,n+2\n)\u223c\n= \u03ba\u2217 (Mg,n\n\nIn other words, the relations among the \u03ba classes in the above cases\nare genus independent. By composing the isomorphisms \u03b9 of Theorem\n2, we obtain isomorphisms\nc\nc\n)\n\u03b9 : \u03ba\u2217 (M0,2g+n\n)\u223c\n= \u03ba\u2217 (Mg,n\n\nso long as n > 0. Hence, universality reduces all questions about the \u03ba\nrings to genus 0.\nIn [12], calculations of the relations, bases, and Betti numbers of the\nc\n) are obtained using the genus 0 reduction. Let P (d) be\nring \u03ba\u2217 (Mg,n>0\nthe set of partitions of d, and let\nP (d, k) \u2282 P (d)\nbe the set of partitions of d into at most k parts. Let |P (d, k)| be\nthe cardinality. To a partition with positive parts p = (p1 , . . . , pl ) in\nP (d, k), we associate a \u03ba monomial by\nc\n\u03bap = \u03bap1 * * * \u03bapl \u2208 \u03bad (Mg,n\n).\n\n\f7\nc\nTheorem 3. For n > 0, a Q-basis of \u03bad (Mg,n\n) is given by\n\n{\u03bap | p \u2208 P (d, 2g \u2212 2 + n \u2212 d) } .\nThe Betti number calculation,\nc\ndimQ \u03bad (Mg,n\n) = |P (d, 2g \u2212 2 + n \u2212 d)| ,\n\nis of course implied by Theorem 3.\nQ5. Is there an analogue of Schubert calculus in the \u03ba ring with respect\nto the basis of Theorem 3?\nc\nThe tautological rings R\u2217 (Mg,n\n) have been conjectured in [3, 11] to\nbe Gorenstein algebras with socle in degree 2g \u2212 3 + n,\n\u223c\n\nc\n\u03c6 : R2g\u22123+n (Mg,n\n)\u2192Q.\n\nThe following result [12] shows the socle evaluation is as non-trivial as\npossible on the \u03ba ring.\nc\nTheorem 4. If n > 0 and \u03be \u2208 \u03bad (Mg,n\n) 6= 0, the linear function\nc\nL\u03be : R2g\u22123+n\u2212d (Mg,n\n)\u2192Q\n\ndefined by the socle evaluation\nL\u03be (\u03b3) = \u03c6(\u03b3 * \u03be)\nis non-trivial.\nAll of the above results for the \u03ba rings in the compact type case\nrequire at least 1 marked point. In the unpointed case n = 0, half\nof the universality still holds: the assignment \u03bai 7\u2192 \u03bai extends to a\nsurjection\nc\n\u03b9g : \u03ba\u2217 (M0,2g\n) \u2192 \u03ba\u2217 (Mgc ) .\n\nHowever, a non-trivial kernel is possible. The first kernel occurs in\ngenus g = 5.\nc\nQ6. What is the kernel of \u03ba\u2217 (M0,2g\n) \u2192 \u03ba\u2217 (Mgc )?\n\nIn genus 5, the kernel of \u03b95 is related to Getzler's relation in M 1,4 ,\nsee [12] for a discussion. A complete answer to Q6 will likely involve\nsequences of special relations in the tautological ring.\n\n\f8\n\nA natural question to ask is whether the \u03ba relations in the compact\ntype case can be put in a form parallel to Theorem 1. An affirmative\nanswer has been found by A. Pixton.\nWe define a set of relations as follows. Let\np = { p1 , p2 , p3 , . . . }\nbe a variable set indexed by all positive integers. Let\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03a8(t, p) = (1 + tp2 + t p4 + t p6 + . . .)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(2i \u2212 1)!! ti\n\ni=0\n\n+ (p1 + tp3 + t2 p5 + . . .)\nwhere (2i \u2212 1)!! =\nformula\n\n(2i)!\n2i i!\n\nas usual.

Furthermore, Pixton proves the relations of Theorem 5\ngenerate all the relations among \u03ba classes in \u03ba\u2217 (Mcg,n ) in case n > 0.\nE. Moduli of stable curves\nThe socle evaluations of polynomials in the \u03ba classes are known for\nall three cases\n\u2217\nc\n\u2217\n\u03ba\u2217 (Mrt\ng,n ), \u03ba (Mg,n ), \u03ba (M g,n ) .\n\nThe \u03ba evaluations can be transformed to Hodge integrals. The relevant\nevaluations of the latter are summarized in [3].

Is there a formula for relations in \u03ba\u2217 (Mg,n ) parallel to\nTheorem 1 and Theorem 5?\nAcknowledgments\nMost of my work on \u03ba classes is related to conversations over the\nyears with C. Faber whom I met for the first time on a spring morning\nin Joe's office when I was a graduate student. Many of the results\nreported here were found in collaboration with A. Pixton (or by Pixton\nhimself) in Princeton and in Lisbon last year. My paper with A. Marian\nand D. Oprea on the moduli space of stable quotients plays an essential\nrole in the proofs. At the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, I was\nsupported by a Marie Curie fellowship and a grant from the Gulbenkian\nfoundation. I am supported by NSF grant DMS-1001154.\nReferences\n[1] S. Boldsen, Improved homological stability for the mapping class group with\nintegral or twisted coefficients, arXiv:0904.3269.\n[2] C.
