Despite these complications, the probability function of the chain, which\nmeasures the probability to pass to a given initial conformation to a final one, is\ncomputed exactly. The Lagrange multiplier imposing the relaxed condition satisfies\na complicated nonlinear equation, which has been solved assuming that the chain is\nvery long.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Rouse's [1] and Zimm's [2] models are able to describe satisfactorily the dynamical\nbehavior of a polymer in a solution [3]. There are however physical situations, such as for\ninstance the case of a chain pulled by strong forces in experiments of micromanipulation of\nDNA [4\u20138], whose correct interpretation requires that the chain is inextensible. To implement the property of inextensibility, it is necessary to introduce constraints in the stochastic\nequations that govern its dynamics. To this purpose, one may use generalized coordinates\nor Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, it is possible to add forces, which become strongly\nrepulsive whenever the chain attempts to abandon the region of the phase space in which the\nconstraints are satisfied. Applying these methods one arrives at equations which determine\nthe dynamics of a chain in the presence of constraints in a very rigorous way, but are also\nvery complicated. Their solution, as much as the practical calculation of physical quantities, require numerical simulations. An approach which leads to a simpler formulation of the\nproblem consists in considering the chain as a system of particles held together by an elastic\n\n\f2\npotential. This potential must be chosen in such a way that in the equilibrium position the\ndistance between two neighboring particles in the chain is equal to some constant a 6= 0.\nIn the limit of infinite elastic constant, one obtains a discrete chain composed by particles\nconnected together by massless segments of length a. In the limit in which a goes to zero,\nwhile the number of particles becomes infinite, one obtains the probability function of a\ncontinuous chain, which measures the probability that the chain passes after a fixed time\ntf from a given initial conformation to a given final conformation. It is possible to show\nthat such probability function is equivalent to the partition function of a nonlinear field\ntheory, which has been discussed in Ref. [9]. The appearance of nonlinearity is related to\nthe inextensibility constraints which require that at any instant t and at each point of the\nchain, whose position is provided by the radius vector R(t, s), the relation\n\n\u2202R(t,s)\n\u2202s\n\n2\n\n= 1 is\n\nsatisfied. Here we have denoted with s the arc\u2013length of the curve describing the spatial\nconformation of the chain. The nonlinear model of Ref. [9] has a relatively simple formulation in terms of path integrals and allows analytic calculations, such as for example that\nof the dynamical form factor in the semiclassical approximation [10]. Yet, it is important\nto have also a suitable\u0012approximation\u0013of that model which is able to simplify the functional\n2\nDirac delta function \u03b4 \u2202R(t,s)\n\u2212 1 . This delta function appears in the model as a result\n\u2202s\n\nof the inextensibility constraints and it is a very nonlinear term. A similar delta function has\nbeen simplified so far in the case of the statistical mechanics\nwhere\n\u0012 of a freely\u0013hinged chain,\nRL\n2\n\u2202R(s) 2\n3\n\u2212 1 \u2212\u2192 e 2a 0 ds( \u2202s )\nthe time variable is not present, using the substitution \u03b4 \u2202R(s)\n\u2202s\n\n[11]. In the latter formula, L represents the total length of the chain. Unfortunately, the\nextension of the approach of Ref. [11] to polymer dynamics is not feasible. To obtain a\nGaussian approximation of the functional delta function comparable to that proposed by\nthe authors of [11] also in the case of dynamics, we use here an alternative strategy borrowed from the statistical mechanics of semi-flexible chains[13, 14]. The idea is to loose the\ncondition that all arcs composing the chain must be inextensible and to require instead that\nthe time averaged total length of the chain should fluctuate around a fixed average value L.\nThis means that the length of the chain is allowed to change in time as it happens in the\nRouse model, but only in such a way that its average is equal to L. This relaxed constraint\nis imposed in the probability function of the chain by introducing a Lagrange multiplier \u03bb,\nwhich is determined by minimizing the partition function as a function of \u03bb. With respect\nto the case of semi-flexible polymers, the situation is complicated by nontrivial boundary\n\n\f3\nconditions and the presence of the time. At the end we are able to compute exactly the\nexplicit expression of the probability function, but for its minimization it is necessary to\nsolve a complicated algebraic equation in \u03bb. We find its solution in the limit of very large\nvalues of the average total length of the chain L up to corrections of the order\n\n1\nL\n\nincluded.\n\nTHE GAUSSIAN APPROXIMATION\n\nWe consider in this work the partition function of the model [9]:\nZ R(tf ,s)=Rf (s)\nR tf R L\n2\nZ=\nDR(t, s)e\u2212c 0 dt 0 ds\u1e58 (t,s) \u03b4(R\u20322 (t, s) \u2212 1)\n\n(1)\n\nR(0,s)=R0 (s)\n\nwhere R(t, s) : [0, tf ] \u00d7 [0, L] \u2212\u2192 Rd is a two dimensional vector field with d components.\nThe partial derivatives of R(t, s) with respect to t and s are denoted as follows:\n\u1e58(t, s) =\n\n\u2202R(t, s)\n\u2202t\n\nR\u2032 (t, s) =\n\n\u2202R(t, s)\n\u2202s\n\n(2)\n\nThe parameter c appearing in the action (1) is given by:\nc=\n\n1\nM\n2L 2kB T \u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nkB denotes the Boltzmann constant, T is the fixed temperature of the thermal bath in which\nthe chain fluctuates and \u03c4 is the relaxation time which characterizes the rate with which\nthe infinitesimal beads lose their speed due to friction. Finally, M is the total mass of the\nchain.\nIt has been shown in [9, 12] that this model describes the dynamics of an inextensible\ncontinuous chain of length L obtained by performing the continuous limit of the partition\nfunction of a freely jointed chain. The dynamics of the chain is followed during the period\nof time t \u2208 [0, tf ]. s \u2208 [0, L] is the arc-length measuring the distance along the chain. The\nvector field R(t, s) denotes the positions of the infinitesimal elements of length ds composing\nthe chain at a given instant t. Z has the meaning of the probability function which measures\nthe probability that the chain during its fluctuations passes from the initial conformation\nR0 (s) at the instant t = 0 to the final conformation Rf (s) at the instant t = tf . The\nconstraints enforcing the conditions that the length of the links connecting the beads should\nbe constant become in the continuous limit the constraint:\nR\u20322 (t, s) = 1\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\nwhich is imposed in Eq. (1) using a functional Dirac delta function. It is easy to check that\nthis constraint implies that the length of every part of the chain is constant in time. Let us\ntake for instance an arc of the curve R(t, s) delimited by the points R(t, s1 ) and R(t, s2 ).\nRs\nIts length l12 (t) is given by: l12 (t) = s12 ds|R\u2032 (t, s)|. Due to Eq. (4) it is possible to write:\nRs\nl12 (t) = s12 ds = s2 \u2212 s1 . Thus\nl\u030712 (t) = 0\n\n(5)\n\nThe probability function Z in Eq. (1) should be completed by appropriated boundary\nconditions. We require that at the initial and final instants 0 and tf the chain is in the\nconfigurations R0 (s) and Rf (s) respectively, i. e.:\nR(tf , s) = Rf (s)\n\n(6)\n\nR(0, s) = R0 (s)\n\n(7)\n\nMoreover, we suppose that the chain is closed, so that periodic boundary conditions will be\nchosen with respect to s:\nR(t, s) = R(t, s + L)\n\n(8)\n\nIn the following, it will be convenient to expand the boundary conformations in Fourier\nseries:\nRf (s) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\ns\n\ne2\u03c0in L bn\n\n(9)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nR0 (s) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\ns\n\ne2\u03c0in L an\n\n(10)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nan and bn being constant vectors. The partition function of the model described by Eq. (1)\nhas been computed in [9] in the semiclassical approximation. It is also possible to derive\nan expression of the dynamic structure factor of the chain always in the semiclassical approximation as shown in [10]. Despite these successes, the presence of the functional Dirac\ndelta function in the right hand side of Eq. (1) makes the analytical treatment of the model\ncomplicated. For this reason, it would be nice to simplify it with a suitable approximation.\nFor instance, in the case of statistical mechanics of polymers, where the time variable is not\nappearing, Edwards and Goodyear [11] have shown for d = 3 that:\n\u03b4(R\u20322 (s) \u2212 a2 ) \u223c e\u2212\n\nRL\n0\n\n3\nR\u20322 (s)\nds 2a\n\n(11)\n\n\f5\nWhile the extension of the results of [11] to dynamics is not straightforward, it is however\npossible to relax the constraint (4) requiring that it is satisfied only in an average sense. To\nthis purpose, following a procedure borrowed from the statistical mechanics of semi-flexible\npolymers, see for instance [13] and [14, 15], we introduce a new parameter \u03bb and replace the\nprobability function (1) with the following simplified one:\nZ(\u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\nR(tf ,s)=Rf (s)\n\nDR(t, s)e\u2212\n\nR(0,s)=R0 (s)\n\nR tf\n0\n\ndt\n\nRL\n0\n\nds[c\u1e582 (t,s)+\u03bb(R\u20322 (t,s)\u22121)]\n\n(12)\n\nNext, the parameter \u03bb is determined by requiring that:\n\u2202Z(\u03bb)\n=0\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(13)\n\nClearly, the above equation is equivalent to:\n\u001d\n\u001c Z tf\nZ\n1 L\n1\n\u20322\ndt\ndsR (t, s) = 1\ntf 0\nL 0\nwhere\nh(. . .)i =\n\nZ\n\nR(tf ,s)=Rf (s)\nR(0,s)=R0 (s)\n\nDR(t, s)e\u2212\n\nR tf\n0\n\ndt\n\nRL\n0\n\nds[c\u1e582 (t,s)+\u03bb(R\u20322 (t,s)\u22121)]\n\n(14)\n\n(. . .)\n\n(15)\n\nIn words, with (14) the functional integration over the conformations R(t, s) has been extended to curves whose arcs do no longer satisfy the constant length condition of Eq. (5).\nAlso the total length of the chain is allowed to change in time, but its average performed\nover all possible conformations and during the period of time tf must be equal to L.\n\nCALCULATION OF THE PROBABILITY FUNCTION Z(\u03bb)\n\nThe rest of this work is dedicated to the derivation of the probability function Z(\u03bb) and\nof the parameter \u03bb, which up to now is the still unknown ingredient of Eq. (12). Unlike the\ncase of semi-flexible polymers, we have to deal here with the nontrivial boundary conditions\n(6) and (7). To get rid of them, it is convenient to split the bond vectors R(t, s) into two\ncomponents:\nR(t, s) = Rcl (t, s) + r(t, s)\n\n(16)\n\nRcl (t, s) is a solutions of the classical equations of motion related to the action:\nS=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ntf\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nL\n\nh\ni\n2\n\u20322\nds c\u1e58 (t, s) + \u03bb(R \u2212 1)\n\n(17)\n\n\f6\nappearing in the probability function of Eq. (12):\ncR\u0308cl + \u03bbR\u2032\u2032cl = 0\n\n(18)\n\nRcl (t, s) satisfies the boundary conditions (6) and (7):\nRcl (tf , s) = Rf (s)\n\nRcl (0, s) = R0 (s)\n\n(19)\n\nr(t, s) represents instead the fluctuations around the classical conformation Rcl (t, s). r(t, s)\nsatisfies the Dirichlet boundary conditions:\nr(tf , s) = r(0, s) = 0\n\n(20)\n\nWith respect to the variable s both Rcl (t, s) and r(t, s) satisfy periodic boundary conditions analogous to those of Eq. (8). After some calculations and without performing any\napproximation, it is possible to show that:\nZ(\u03bb) = e\u2212S(Rcl ) eLtf \u03bb Zf luct (\u03bb)\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the action S(Rcl ) contains the contribution coming from the classical background\nconformations:\nS(Rcl ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ntf\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n0\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u20322\n2\nds c\u1e58cl + \u03bbRcl\n\n(22)\n\nwhile Zf luct (\u03bb) is the partition function of the fluctuations:\nZ\nR tf R L\n2\n\u20322\nZf luct (\u03bb) = Dre\u2212 0 dt 0 ds(c\u1e59 +\u03bbr )\n\n(23)\n\nFirst, we will compute S(Rcl ). It is possible to check after some integrations by parts that\nS(Rcl ) = c\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nwith \u1e58cl (tf , s) =\n\n\u2202Rcl (t,s)\n\u2202t\n\nt=tf\n\nL\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nds Rf (s) * \u1e58cl (tf , s) \u2212 R0 (s) * \u1e58cl (0, s)\n\nand \u1e58cl (0, s) =\n\n\u2202Rcl (t,s)\n\u2202t\n\nt=0\n\n(24)\n\n.

(24), we obtain:\nS(Rcl ) = \u2212cL\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b2\u2212n\n\n\u0014\n\ncosh(\u03b2\u2212n tf )\n1\n(bn * a\u2212n + an * b\u2212n ) +\n(bn * b\u2212n + an * a\u2212n )\n\u2212\nsinh(\u03b2\u2212n tf )\nsinh(\u03b2\u2212n tf )\n(27)\n\nNext, we derive the partition function of the fluctuations Zf luct(\u03bb). From Eq. (23) it turns\nout in d = 3 that:\n3\n\nZf luct(\u03bb) = (det\u2032 \u2206)\u2212 2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the differential operator:\n\u2206=c\n\n\u22022\n\u22022\n+\n\u03bb\n\u2202t2\n\u2202s2\n\n(29)\n\nThe prime after the symbol of determinant in Eq. (28) means that the zero modes of the\noperator \u2206 should be projected out from the expression of the determinant. At this point\nwe compute the eigenvalues of \u2206. To this purpose, we have to solve the equation:\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u2202\n\u22022\nc 2 + \u03bb 2 \u03c8 = \u2212E\u03c8\n\u2202t\n\u2202s\n\n(30)\n\nDirichlet boundary conditions with respect to the time variable are assumed according to\nEq. (20). Moreover, \u03c8 should obey periodic boundary conditions with respect to s. It is\npossible to check that there exist solutions of Eq. (30) with such boundary conditions when\nE takes the values:\nEn,k = 4\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\u03bb\nc\nn 2 + k2 2\nL\n2tf\n2\n\n!\n\nn, k = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .\n\n(31)\n\nThese solutions are the eigenfunctions:\n+\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c8n,k (t, s) =\n\ns\n\ne2\u03c0in L \u03c8n,k (t)\n\n(32)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere\n\n\"s \u0012\n\u0013#\n1\n4\u03c0 2 n2\n\u03c8n,k (t) = A sinh t\n\u03bb 2 + En,k\nc\nL\n\n(33)\n\nand A is a normalization constant. Excluding the trivial zero mode occurring for n = k = 0,\nwe find that\ndet\u2032 \u2206 =\n\nQ\u2032\n\nn,k\u22650\n\n\"\n\n4\u03c0 2\n\nc\n\u03bb\nn2 2 + k 2 2\nL\n2tf\n\n!#\n\n(34)\n\n\u0015\n\n\f8\nIn the above equation the prime in the product\n\nQ\u2032\n\nn,k\u22650\n\nmeans that the case n = k = 0,\n\nwhich corresponds to the excluded zero mode, should be omitted. Now we rewrite det\u2032 \u2206 as\nfollows:\ndet\u2032 \u2206 =\n\n\u0012\nQ\u2032\n\n\u03bb\nn,k\u22650 2\nL\n\n\u0013\n\nQ\u2032\n\nn,k\u22650\n\n\"\n\n4\u03c0 2\n\ncL2 k 2\nn2 + 2\n2tf \u03bb\n\nUsing the \u03b6\u2212function regularization it is possible to show that\ndet\u2032 \u2206 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\nL2\n\n\u0013 45\n\nQ\u2032\n\nn,k\u22650\n\n\"\n\n4\u03c0 2\n\n!#\n\nQ\u2032\n\ncL2 k 2\nn2 + 2\n2tf \u03bb\n\n\u03bb\nn,k\u22650 L2\n\n(35)\n=\n\n!#\n\n\u03bb\nL2\n\n\u0001 54\n\n. Thus:\n(36)\n\nThe remaining semi-infinite product has been evaluated by several authors, see for instance\n[16\u201320].

(27) and (39), the total probability function Z(\u03bb) of\nEq. (21) may be rewritten as follows:\nZ(\u03bb) = eF (\u03bb)\n\n(40)\n\nwhere\n15\nF (\u03bb) = \u2212S(Rcl ) + Ltf \u03bb \u2212\nln\n8\n\n\u03c4 2c\n2t2f\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n\u03c0\u03c4\n3X\n3\nln 1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c0\u03c4\nln \u03c4 +\n\u2212\n2\n8\n2 n>0\n\nClearly, the condition (13) that determines \u03bb is equivalent to the condition\n\u2202S(Rcl )\n21 1 \u03c0 tf\n\u2212 Ltf +\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03bb\n8 \u03bb 8L\n\nr\n\n1 1\n3X\ntf\n2\u03c0n\n\u221a +\ne\u22122\u03c0n\u03c4\n\u22122\u03c0n\u03c4\n2c \u03bb 2 n>0 1 \u2212 e\nL\n\nr\n\n\u2202F (\u03bb)\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(41)\n\n= 0, i. e.:\n\n1 1\n\u221a =0\n2c \u03bb\n\n(42)\n\nAs it stands, the above equation is too difficult to be solved analytically with respect to \u03bb.\nFor this reason, we assume that the chain is very long, i.e. L >> 1, so that it is possible\n\n\f9\nto expand \u03bb and the coefficients appearing in Eq. (42) in powers of L\u22121 . In doing that, we\nsuppose that \u03bb remains finite in the limit L \u2212\u2192 +\u221e, so that:\n\u03bb \u223c \u03bb0 +\n\n1\n\u03bb1 + . . .\nL\n\n(43)\n\nThis hypothesis on \u03bb, which will be checked a posteriori, has a physical motivation. In\nfact, if \u03bb becomes infinite with the average chain length L, then conformations for which\nR tf 1 R L\n1\ndt L 0 dsR\u20322 < 1 will be strongly preferred in the probability function of Eq. (12), a\ntf 0\n\nfact which is clearly unphysical.\n\nAt this point, we are ready to expand all the terms entering in Eq. (42) in powers of\n\n1\n.\nL\n\nThis expansion is almost trivial apart from the case of the two terms\nI1 =\n\n\u2202S(Rcl )\n\u2202\u03bb\n\nand\n3X\n2\u03c0n\ntf\nI2 =\ne\u22122\u03c0n\u03c4\n\u22122\u03c0n\u03c4\n2 n>0 1 \u2212 e\nL\n\n(44)\nr\n\n1 1\n\u221a\n2c \u03bb\n\n(45)\n\nI1 depends on \u03bb implicitly through the coefficients \u03b2n , while I2 has an explicit dependence\non \u03bb together with an implicit dependence through the coefficient \u03c4 . Provided Eq. (43) is\nfulfilled [21], we note that both parameters \u03b2n and \u03c4 , being proportional to\n\n1\n,\nL\n\nare going to\n\nzero when L goes to infinity. Using the above considerations and neglecting contributions\nof order\n\n1\nL\n\nor higher, we obtain:\nI1 \u223c 0\nr\nr\n3 L c 1\n3\nc \u03bb1\n9 1\nI2 \u223c\n\u2212\n3 \u2212\n8\u03c0 tf 2 \u03bb 2\n4\u03bb0 16 \u03c0tf 2 \u03bb 25\n0\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\n0\n\nAfter completing the expansion in powers of L1 of the remaining terms, Eq. (42) becomes:\n!\n!\nr\nr\nc 1\nc \u03bb1\n9\n3\n1\n15 1\n\u2212\nL\n(48)\n+\n+ O( ) = 0\n3 \u2212 tf\n5\n8\u03c0tf 2 \u03bb 2\n8 \u03bb0 16\u03c0tf 2 \u03bb 2\nL\n0\n\n0\n\nEquating to zero separately the coefficients accompanying different powers of L we obtain\ntwo relations which are able to determine both \u03bb0 and \u03bb1 :\ns\n9c\n\u03bb0 = 3\n128\u03c0 2 t4f\n\u03bb1 =\n\n5\n4tf\n\n(49)\n\n(50)\n\n\f10\nAs a result it is possible to write down the expansion of \u03bb which is valid for large values of\nL up to the order\n\n1\n:\nL\n\n\u03bb\u223c\n\ns\n3\n\n9c\n1 5\n+\n4\n2\n128\u03c0 tf\nL 4tf\n\n(51)\n\nThis, together with Eqs. (40\u201341) concludes the evaluation of the probability function (12).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this article a gaussian approximation of the nonlinear model (1) has been presented,\nwhich describes the probability of a chain to pass from a given conformation to another.\nThe approximation consists in replacing the local constraint (4) with a milder one, that\nrequires only that during the fluctuations of the chain, its average length must be equal to\nL. To enforce this new constraint, the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb has been introduced. \u03bb has\nbeen determined exploiting the condition that, as a function of \u03bb, the probability function\nZ(\u03bb) of Eq. (12) has a minimum. Eq. (14) shows that this condition is equivalent to impose the relaxed constraint. While it is possible to compute the probability function Z(\u03bb)\nexactly despite the complications due to the presence of nontrivial boundary conditions, its\nminimization requires the solution with respect to \u03bb of the complicated algebraic equation\ngiven in Eq. (42). This equation has been solved in the limit of very large values of L up to\nthe second order included, see Eq. (51). It is shown that \u03bb goes to zero for increasing values\nof the evolution time tf . This means that the deviations of the length of the chain from\nthe expected value L increase with the increase of the time in which the chain is allowed to\nfluctuate.\nThe present approach avoids the difficulties involved with the functional delta function of\nthe original probability function (1) and it is still able to take into account the inextensibility\nof the chain, at least in an approximated way. The probability function Z(\u03bb) of Eq. (12)\nwith the relaxed constraint has been computed here exactly, see Eqs. (40\u201341), while the\nanalogous probability function with the full constraint (1) could be derived only in semiclassical approximation. The approximated model of Eq. (12) may be used as a basis for\nfurther computations of physical observables, such as for instance the dynamic form factor\nof a chain.\n\n\f11\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors wish to thank J.
