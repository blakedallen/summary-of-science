The spectacular progress\nachieved in disordered Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\nhave recently lead to the first direct observation of Anderson localization of matter-waves [1,2], showing remarkable\nagreement with theoretical calculations [3, 4]. A future\nchallenge to ultracold gases is the production of disordered\nFermi systems. Even better than Bose gases, they would\nmimic systems of direct relevance for condensed-matter\nphysics, such as dirty superconductors [5] and granular\nmetals [6]. Moreover, ultracold gases provide original insights on transport phenomena without direct counterparts in traditional condensed-matter physics. For instance, ultracold atoms trapped in harmonic potentials\nmay undergo dipole oscillations \u2013 i.e. oscillations of the\ncenter of mass (CM) \u2013 that can be observed for tens of\nperiods. Since dipole oscillations are undamped in pure\nharmonic traps, irrespective to the nature of particles,\ntemperature and interactions [7], damping results from\nthe influence of external potentials only. Hence, dipole oscillations have been used to characterize several properties\nof quantum gases [8, 9]. These include bosonic quantum\ndegeneracy [10], inhibition of transport of Bose gases in\none-dimensional (1D) optical lattices [11], fermionic band\n\nZCM(t)/d\n\narXiv:0812.3501v2 [cond-mat.other] 11 Dec 2009\n\nDipole oscillations of a Fermi gas in a disordered trap: damping\nand localization\n\n0.5\n\nVR = 25 h\u03c9z\n\n0\n\nVR = 10 h\u03c9z\n\n\u22120.5\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c9zt /2\u03c0\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n(d)\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c9z t /2\u03c0\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFig. 1: Dipole oscillations of a 3D elongated (\u03bb = 8) disordered\nFermi gas. a) The oscillations are excited by shifting the trap\nfrom z = d to z = 0 at time t = 0.

Pezz\u00e8 et al.\nIn this work, we study the dipole oscillations of a spinpolarized Fermi gas in a harmonic trap combined with\na 1D disordered potential. Dipole oscillations are induced by a sudden displacement of the trap center (see\nFig. 1(a)), a technique which is routinely used in experiments with ultracold atoms. We find strong damping\neven for weak disorder, and identify a metal-insulator\ncrossover when the disorder is increased. We show that\nfor very weak disorder, damping results from dephasing\nof different modes oscillating with frequencies randomly\nshifted around the harmonic oscillator frequency. This\nleads to weakly-damped and almost centered oscillations\n(see Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)), which are accurately described\nby perturbation theory. For increasing disorder, the Fermi\ngas crosses over to a strongly insulating regime, characterized by strongly-damped oscillations with large offset (see\nFig. 1(d)). This insulating regime is due to the proliferation of single-particle localized states. So far, dipole\noscillations in the presence of disorder have been studied\nonly in BECs [16, 17]. In this case, damping is due to\ndissipation induced by repulsive interactions [17], a process completely different from the one we identify here for\nnon-interacting Fermi gases.\nFramework. \u2013 We consider a Fermi gas at thermal\nequilibrium with temperature T in a 3D axially-symmetric\nharmonic trap of frequencies \u03c9z in the longitudinal direction z and \u03c9\u22a5 in the radial directions x, y (the aspect ratio is \u03bb = \u03c9\u22a5 /\u03c9z ). The trap is initially centered at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, d). Because of the Pauli exclusion principle, the fermions populate the single-particle\n(d)\neigenstates of the displaced trap, \u03a6nx ,ny ,nz (x, y, z) =\n(d)\n\u03c6nx ,ny (x, y)\u03c6nz (z), according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Here, |\u03c6nx ,ny i is the eigenfunction of the radial\nharmonic trap associated with the eigenenergy ~\u03c9\u22a5 (nx +\n(d)\nny + 1).\u221a The function \u03c6n (z) \u2261 \u03c6n (z \u2212 d) with \u03c6n (z) =\nn\n\u22121/2\n2\n(n!2 lz \u03c0)\nexp (\u2212z /2lz2 )Hn (z/lz ) is the eigenfunction of the 1D longitudinal harmonic potential associated\nwith eigenenergy \u01ebn = ~\u03c9z (n + 1/2), wherep\nHn (z) is the\nHermite polynomial of index n and lz =\n~/m\u03c9z the\noscillator length in the z-direction. At time t = 0, the\ntrap center is abruptly shifted to z = 0 and a 1D homogeneous disordered potential, V (z) = VR v(z/\u03c3R ), with\naverage hV i = 0, amplitude VR and correlation length \u03c3R ,\nis switched on (see Fig. 1(a)). In the absence of disorder,\nthis process induces undamped dipole oscillations of the\nCM along z, ZCM (t) = d cos(\u03c9z t) [7]. In the presence of\ndisorder, we write the CM motion, averaged over different\nrealizations of the disorder, as\n\nUsing the density-matrix formalism, the CM motion\nreads ZCM (t) = Tr[\u1e91e\u2212i\u0124t/~ \u03c1\u0302eff e+i\u0124t/~ ], where\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\n1\n~2 d2\n+ m\u03c9z2 z 2 + V (z)\n2m dz 2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nis the single-particle Hamiltonian along the z axis, and\n\u03c1\u0302eff is an effective density matrix. The expression of \u03c1\u0302eff\nis obtained by tracing out the radial degrees of freedom,\nwhich is possible because the 3D Hamiltonian is spatially\nseparable and unchanged in the x, y directions at t = 0.\nWe find\n\u03c1\u0302eff =\n\nX f n (T, \u03bc, \u03bb)\n(d)\neff\n|\u03c6(d)\nn ih\u03c6n |,\nN\nn\n\n(3)\n\nn\nwhere the effective Fermi distribution, feff\n(T, \u03bc, \u03bb) =\nP+\u221e\nn\u22a5 +1\n,\nincludes\nthe\noccupation\nn\u22a5 =0 e[~\u03c9z (n+\u03bbn\u22a5 )\u2212\u03bc]/kB T +1\nnumbers\nof the radial-trap levels [18] and N =\nP n\nn feff (T, \u03bc, \u03bb) is the total number of Fermions. In a 3D\nelongated Fermi gas (\u03bb = \u03c9\u22a5 /\u03c9z > 1), the 1D limit is\nachieved when the population of the transverse excitation\nmodes can be neglected. This occurs for ~\u03c9\u22a5 \u2212 \u03bc \u226b kB T\nwhen \u03bc > 0 and \u03bc \u226b kB T (degenerate limit) or for\n~\u03c9\u22a5 \u226b kB T when \u03bc < 0 and |\u03bc| \u226b kB T (classical limit).\nTo evaluate explicitly ZCM (t), we use the eigenfunctions\n{|\u03c8n i, n \u2208 N} and the associated eigenenergies {En } of\nHamiltonian \u0124. The ZCM (t) can be decomposed as in\nEq.

The disordered potential affects the energy spectrum (i.e. both En and |\u03c8n i)\nof the harmonic oscillator, which, from Eq. (4), appears to\nhave a twofold effect on Zosc (t). First, it induces random,\nincommensurate, energy shifts which dephase the different\noscillating components of the sum in Eq. (4). As we will\nsee, this is the main contribution to the damping effect\nfor sufficiently weak disorder. Second, it induces random\nmodifications to the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions,\nwhich affect the terms h\u03c8p |\u1e91|\u03c8n i and \u03c1n,p\neff . According to\nEq. (5), these modifications are also responsible for the\nexistence of an oscillation offset, Z\u221e .\nEquations (4) and (5) are the basis of both our analytiZCM (t) = Zosc (t) + Z\u221e ,\n(1)\ncal and numerical calculations. In the numerics, we use a\nwhere Zosc (t) \u223c \u0393(t) cos(\u03c9z t) is the oscillating part with speckle potential similar to that used in many experiments\n\u0393(t) an envelope function giving the damping of the oscil- on disordered quantum gases [1, 19], for which the autolations and Z\u221e is the oscillation offset.

(4). We take into account first order\ndisorder-induced shifts to the harmonic oscillator eigenenergies and approximate the eigenfunctions |\u03c8n i with the\n(0)\nharmonic oscillator ones |\u03c6n i. Note that, as we will show,\nthe offset Z\u221e requires second-order perturbation calculations. For consistency in Eq. (1), one should in principle use also second-order perturbation for calculating the\nenvelope Zosc (t). However, it leads to small corrections\nin Zosc (t) so we disregard them. We have checked numerically that perturbation of the eigenfunctions has a\nnegligible contribution to the damping, at least until almost complete dephasing has occurred. Then, Eq.

These\nresults show increasing damping for increasing disorder, as\nexpected. More precisely, we find a crossover from weakdamping (metal-like) regime for very weak disorder (see\nFig. 1(b,c)) to strong-damping (insulator-like) regime characterized by a significant offset for stronger disorder (see\nFig. 1(d)). As we will show, weak-damping results from\ndisorder-induced weak perturbations of the energy spectrum, while strong-damping signals strong localization of\nthe Fermi gas.\n\n2\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n20\n\n30\n\nlz /\u03c3R\n\n40\n\n50\n\n3D\n\n60\n\n1D\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nVR /h\u03c9z\nFig. 2: Damping time, \u03c4 , versus VR in 1D and 3D (\u03bb = 8)\nFermi gases, both for \u03bc = 200 ~\u03c9z and \u03c3R = 0.08 lz . The\ninset is \u03c4 as a function of \u03c3R for the 3D gas. The lines are the\npredictions of Eq. (7) and the points are results of numerical\nsimulations. The dashed line in the inset is the white noise\nlimit. The parameters are d = 5 lz and T = 0.\n\nGaussian function [23]. To compare Eq. (7) with numerical data, we introduce the damping time \u03c4 , defined by\nthe equation \u0393(\u03c4 ) = 1/2. Although \u03c4 depends on both\ndisorder and initial state of the Fermi gas, one can obtain\nsome universal properties from the fact that the contribution of disorder (which appears only in the coefficient\nof the exponential function in Eq. (7)) is separated from\n(d)\nthat of the initial state (in the quantities Fn,n+1 only).\nIn particular, we find \u03c4 \u221d ~/|VR | for any model of disorder and initial density matrix. Numerical results for 1D\nand 3D Fermi gases at zero temperature shown in Fig. 2\nconfirm this prediction. The behavior of \u03c4 versus the correlation length \u03c3R is more complicated. In the white-noise\n\u221a\nlimit, \u03c3R \u226a lz / nF , where nF = \u03bc/~\u03c9z is the longitudinal\nFermi level, there are many disorder peaks within the typ\u221a\nical wavelength lz / nF of the Fermi gas. The disordered\n(0)\npotential felt by the wavefunctions |\u03c6n i with n \u2264 nF almost averages out. When \u03c3R increases, the eigenfunctions\nare more sensitive to the disorder so that we expect that\n\u03c4 decreases. This behavior is confirmed by Eq. (7): In the\nwhite noise p\nlimit the functions Rn are independent of \u03c3R\nso that \u03c4 \u221d lz /\u03c3R . The coupling of the Fermi gas to the\n\u221a\ndisorder is maximum when \u03c3R \u223c lz / nF [24]. Beyond, we\nthus expect that \u03c4 increases.\nIn the limit of large correla\u221a\ntion length, \u03c3R \u226b lz 2nF , the typical size of the disorder\npeaks exceed the size of the Fermi gas. Hence, the disordered potential induces only an energy shift which is approximately equal for all the eigenstates below the Fermi\nenergy, and we recover harmonic oscillations (i.e. \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e).\nThis is again confirmed by Eq. (7): Since the width of c\u0303\nis unity we find Rn (\u03c3R /lz ) \u221d (lz /\u03c3R )5 and \u03c4 \u221d (\u03c3R /lz )2 .\nThese features explain the non-monotonous behavior of \u03c4\nversus \u03c3R obtained in the Inset of Fig. 2.\nIn contrast to damping, the oscillation offset results\nonly from perturbation on the eigenfunctions |\u03c8n i (see\nEq. (5)) [25]. Since the average of the disorder vanishes\neverywhere, hV (z)i = 0, first-order perturbation is not\n\np-3\n\n\fL.

This is even more striking in Fig. 1(b,c) where\nwe plot the dipole oscillations as obtained independently (i) from exact numerical calculations (based on\nEqs. (4),(5); solid black lines) and (ii) from the prediction of Eqs. (1),(7),(8) (dashed red lines).

This is confirmed,\nfor small enough values of VR , by the results of numerical\ncalculations plotted in Fig. 3. Again, the dependence of\nZ\u221e versus \u03c3R is non-monotonous, as shown in the Inset\n\u221a\nof Fig. 3. In the white-noise limit, \u03c3R \u226a lz / nF , we\nfind that\u221a Z\u221e \u221d \u03c3R , while for large correlation length,\n4\n\u03c3R \u226b lz 2nF , we have Z\u221e \u221d lz5 /\u03c3R\n.\nLet us comment on two important properties. First, we\nfind that strong damping occurs even for very weak disorder. For instance, VR = 5~\u03c9z (equal to 0.025\u03bc in Figs. 3\nand 4) corresponds to \u03c4 \u2243 2\u03c0/\u03c9z , meaning that damping\noccurs typically on few oscillations (see Fig. 1(c)). Second, we find that, for the same chemical potential, the\neffect of disorder is weaker in 1D than in 3D (the damping\ntime \u03c4 is larger and the offset Z\u221e smaller). This can be\nunderstood intuitively from the properties of the effective\nn\nFermi distribution feff\n(T, \u03bc, \u03bb). Indeed, for stronger radial trapping (i.e. for increasing \u03bb or in 1D compared to\n3D) and fixed Fermi energy, the population of low-energy\nstates, which are more affected by the disorder, decreases.\nSimilarly, we have found that finite temperature increases\nthe damping time \u03c4 and decreases the offset Z\u221e although\nthe effect is quite weak. For instance, we find that a temperature T = 0.5 TF , where TF is the Fermi temperature,\nleads to a small correction of about 10%, without affecting\nthe general behavior of \u03c4 and Z\u221e versus the parameters.\n\nStrong-damping regime and localization. \u2013 In\nthe strong-damping regime (i.e. for VR & 10 ~\u03c9z for the\nparameters of Figs. 1-3), dipole oscillations are largely\nsuppressed (see Fig. 1(d)) and it is difficult to define an\nenvelope function \u0393(t). At the same time, the offset becomes significant (see Fig. 3) and tends to Z\u221e \u2243 d for\nvery large VR [26]. This behavior signals the crossover\nto a strongly insulating regime which can be related to\nthe onset of single-particle localization. Indeed, as shown\nby Eq. (5), the oscillation offset Z\u221e is the sum of the\naverage position of each eigenfunction in the disordered\ntrap, zn \u2261 h\u03c8n |\u1e91|\u03c8n i, weighted by the corresponding population, \u03c1n,n\neff [25]. Extended states \u2013which are centered\naround the trap minimum (zn \u2243 0)\u2013 do not contribute to\nZ\u221e . Conversely, localized states which are spread at random positions in the trap, zn 6= 0, may contribute to Z\u221e ,\ndepending on their relative population \u03c1n,n\neff .\nThe two important features that determine the oscillation offset are thus the localization properties of the\neigenfunctions in the presence of the harmonic trap, and\ntheir populations, which are governed by the initial, displaced Fermi gas. In order to interpret the dipole motion\nin the strong-damping regime, we now discuss these features. The eigenfunctions |\u03c8n i are obtained by numerical\ndiagonalization of Hamiltonian \u0124 and characterized by\ntwo quantities: (i) the localization\nR center, zn , and (ii) the\nparticipation length, Pn = 1/ dz|\u03c8n (z)|4 , which gives\nthe typical extension (width) of the quantum states [27].\nTheir populations \u03c1n,n\neff are obtained by projecting the initial state of the Fermi gas on the eigenfunctions |\u03c8n i. Figure 4 shows all these features for a 1D Fermi gas at T = 0,\nwith \u03bc = 200~\u03c9 and initially centred at d = 5lz . For\neach eigenenergy En , we plot a vertical line of length Pn ,\ncentred at position zn , and weighted by \u03c1n,n\neff (color scale).\nThe different Figs. 4(a)-(f) correspond to the same realization of a speckle potential but different values of VR . As\ncan be anticipated, in the weak-damping regime, we find\nthat the eigenfunctions are not localized (see Fig. 4(a)).\nThe values of Pn are close to the participation length Pn0\ncalculated for the harmonic trap without disorder (solid\nblue line). The corresponding zn slightly fluctuate around\nthe trap center, so that Z\u221e \u226a d. Increasing the amplitude VR of the disordered potential (see Figs. 4(b) and\n4(c)), most of the populated states remain extended but\n\np-4\n\n\fDipole oscillations of a Fermi gas in a disordered trap: damping and localization\n\nFig. 4: Localization in a disordered trap. Vertical lines centred in zn and of length given by the participation length Pn are\nplotted at energy En . The color scale is given by the weight \u03c1n,n\neff : it goes from zero (white regions) to one (dark regions). For\nclarity, the background\n(BG)\nis\nin\nlight\nblue\ncolor.\nThe\nhorizontal\ndashed lines indicate the spatial region covered by the initial\n\u221a\n\u221a\nFermi gas, i.e. d \u2212 lz 2nF \u2264 z \u2264 d + lz 2nF . The different figures refer to different values of VR and the same realization of\n(0)\nspeckle disorder. The solid blue line in Fig. (a) shows the participation length Pn of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions in the\nabsence of disorder (VR = 0).\n\nbecome more and more perturbed. In the crossover regime\n(Figs 4(d) and 4(e)), strongly localized states, randomly\ndistributed in the trap, appear at low energies. The states\nwith lowest energy, which are more sensitive to the disorder and thus more strongly localized, are populated when\nthey lie in the spatial region covered by the initial Fermi\ngas (delimited by the horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 4).\nThese states, being spatially separated from each other, do\nnot contribute significantly to the sum that determines the\noscillation (see Eq. (4)). In contrast, they do contribute to\nthe offset (see Eq. (5)) since they are mostly located on the\nside of the initial gas. The populated states with higher energy are not localized and extend beyond the spatial region\ncovered by the initial Fermi gas. They can thus contribute\nto the oscillation, but not significantly to the offset since\ntheir average center is close the trap center. Finally, for\nvery large amplitudes VR of the disorder (Figs. 4(f)), the\nFermi gas enters the strong-damping regime. In this case,\nmost of the populated states are strongly localized and located in the region covered by the initial Fermi gas, with\nenergies about up to the chemical potential. Note that the\nupper part of Figs. 4(e) and 4(f), above the dashed line,\nshows states which are strongly localized but not populated since they lie outside the initial Fermi gas. Some\nextended states with energy above the chemical potential\ncan also, appear but with very small population. The CM\nof the Fermi gas is thus frozen at Zoff \u2243 d. This explains\nqualitatively the behavior observed in Fig. 3.\n\nAs we have shown, localization is a crucial ingredient for\nthe metal-insulator crossover investigated here. Although\nlocalization is mainly due to the disordered potential, it\nis clear that the harmonic trap significantly affects the localized states. For instance, by virtue of finite-size effects,\nthe lowest-energy states are localized near the trap center\n(see Figs. 4). Moreover, the exponential decay of localized states, which is the most striking signature of Anderson localization [1, 2], is strongly suppressed since the\nharmonic potential dominates at large distances. More\nsurprisingly, our numerical data show that localized and\nextended states can coexist in the same region of the spectrum at intermediate energies (see for instance Figs. 4(d)\nand 4(e)), an effect due to the trapping potential. In the\nfuture, it will thus be interesting to study single-particle\nlocalization in disordered traps. On one hand, it differs\nqualitatively form localization in homogeneous disorder,\nand, on the other hand, it is directly relevant to experiments on disordered quantum gases.\nConclusions. \u2013 Dipole oscillations are an important\ntool for studying the dynamical properties of ultracold\ngases [8\u201317]. We have shown that dipole oscillations of\ntrapped, disordered Fermi gases reveal a metal-insulator\ncrossover for increasing disorder. Weak disorder induces\nweak-damping associated to weak perturbations of the energy spectrum. Stronger disorder leads to strong-damping\ncharacterized by a large oscillation offset, which signals the\nonset of localization. We have related the insulating prop-\n\np-5\n\n\fL.
