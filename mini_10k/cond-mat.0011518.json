During the last few years, our understanding of the MIT in the one-band Hubbard model has\nconsiderably improved, in particular due to the application of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).\nWithin DMFT the electronic lattice problem is\nmapped onto a self-consistent single-impurity Anderson\nmodel. The mapping becomes exact in the limit of infinite coordination number [2] and allows one to investigate the dynamics of correlated lattice electrons nonperturbatively at all interaction strengths. This is of\nessential importance for a problem like the MIT which\noccurs at a Coulomb interaction comparable to the electronic band-width. The transition is signaled by the\ncollapse of the quasiparticle peak at the Fermi energy\nwhen the interaction is increased [3]. Rozenberg et al.\n[4] first applied DMFT to investigate the metal-insulator\ntransition in V2 O3 in terms of the one-band Hubbard\nmodel. Subsequently, the influence of orbital degeneracy\nwas studied by means of the two- [5\u20137] and three-band\n[6] Hubbard model for a Bethe density of states (DOS).\nClearly, a realistic theory of V2 O3 must take into account the complicated electronic structure of this system.\nIn the high-temperature paramagnetic phase V2 O3 has\na corundum crystal structure in which the V ions are\nsurrounded by an octahedron of oxygen ions. This leads\nto an electronic structure with a 3d2 V 3+ state, where\nthe two eg -orbitals are empty and the three t2g -orbitals\nare filled with two electrons. A small trigonal distortion lifts the triple degeneracy of the t2g -orbitals, resulting in one non-degenerate a1g -orbital oriented along the\nc-axis and two degenerate e\u03c0g orbitals oriented predominantly in the hexagonal plane. Starting from this orbital\nstructure Castellani et al. [8] proposed a widely accepted\nmodel with a strong covalent a1g -bond between two V\n\nions along the c-axis. This bonding state is occupied\nby a singlet pair (one electron per V) and hence does\nnot contribute to the local magnetic moment. The remaining electron per V has a twofold orbital degeneracy\nwithin the e\u03c0g orbitals and a spin S = 1/2. This S = 1/2\nmodel suggested that the half filled, one-band Hubbard\nmodel was the simplest possible electronic model describing V2 O3 . However, recent experimental results by Park\net al. [9] obtained by polarized X-ray spectroscopy seem\nto require an interpretation in terms of a S = 1 spin\nstate, and an e\u03c0g e\u03c0g orbital state with an admixture of\ne\u03c0g a1g configurations. Subsequently, Ezhov et al. [10] and\nMila et al. [11] argued for S = 1 models without and\nwith orbital degeneracy, respectively, for the antiferromagnetic insulating phase of V2 O3 . LDA+U calculations indicate that the atomic Hund's rule is responsible for the high-spin ground state of the V ions [10].\nWhile LDA+U may be used to describe the antiferromagnetic insulating phase of V2 O3 , the metal-insulator\ntransition within the correlated paramagnetic phase is beyond the scope of this approach since the Coulomb interaction is treated within Hartree-Fock. Here the computational scheme LDA+DMFT [12\u201315], obtained by combining electronic bandstructure theory (LDA) with the\nmany-body technique DMFT [2], is the best available\nab initio method for the investigation of correlated electronic systems close to a Mott-Hubbard MIT [16]. To\nsolve the DMFT-equations we employ quantum MonteCarlo simulations (QMC) which yield a numerically exact solution [17]; the resulting calculational scheme is\nreferred to as LDA+DMFT(QMC) [13,15,16].\nWe start by calculating the density of states (DOS)\nof paramagnetic metallic V2 O3 and paramagnetic insulating (V0.962 Cr0.038 )2 O3 , respectively, within LDA using the crystal structure data of Dernier [18,19]. In the\nLDA DOS, Fig. 1, one observes the expected behavior:\nthe V t2g states are near the Fermi energy and are split\n\n1\n\n\fDOS (1/eV)\n\n4\n3\n\n(V0.962Cr0.038)2O3\n\nonly the LDA DOS of the three t2g bands shown in Fig.1\nenter the calculation [16]. While the Hund's rule coupling J is insensitive to screening effects and may thus\nbe obtained within LDA to a good accuracy (J = 0.93\neV [21]), the LDA-calculated value of the Coulomb repulsion U has a typical uncertainty of at least 0.5 eV [15].\nHence, the critical value of U for the MIT in V2 O3 is\nnot a priori known and must be determined within our\nscheme.\nThe spectra obtained by LDA+DMFT(QMC) are\nshown in Fig.2 [23]. They imply that the critical value\nof U for the MIT is about 5 eV. Indeed, at U = 4.5\neV one observes pronounced quasiparticle peaks at the\nFermi energy, i.e., characteristic metallic behavior, even\nfor the crystal structure of (V0.962 Cr0.038 )2 O3 , while at\nU = 5.5 eV the form of the calculated spectral function\nis typical for an insulator for both sets of crystal structure parameters. At U = 5.0 eV one is then at, or very\nclose to, the MIT since there is a pronounced dip in the\nDOS at the Fermi energy for both a1g and e\u03c0g orbitals for\nthe crystal structure of (V0.962 Cr0.038 )2 O3 , while for pure\nV2 O3 one still finds quasiparticle peaks. (We note that\nat 1000K one only observes metallic-like and insulatorlike behavior, with a rapid but smooth crossover between\nthese two phases, since a sharp MIT occurs only at lower\ntemperatures [5,3]).

The\nresults for corundum V2 O3 and (V0.962 Cr0.038 )2 O3 are\nvery similar, and are close to those found by Mattheiss\n[20] and Ezhov et al. [10] for the corundum and the monoclinic phase. The change in the LDA DOS on going\nfrom metallic V2 O3 to insulating (V0.962 Cr0.038 )2 O3 only\nconsists in a slight narrowing of the t2g and e\u03c3g bands\nby \u2248 0.2 and 0.1 eV, respectively, as well as a weak\ndownshift of the centers of gravity of both groups of\nbands, which can be attributed to the crystallographic\nchanges. Most important is the fact that the insulating\ngap observed experimentally for the Cr-doped system is\nmissing in the LDA DOS. It is generally believed that\nthis insulating gap is due to strong Coulomb interactions\nwhich cannot be described adequately within LDA. Using LDA+DMFT(QMC) we will now show explicitly that\nthe insulating gap is indeed caused by the electronic correlations.\nIn the LDA+DMFT approach [12\u201316] the LDA band\nstructure, expressed by a one-particle Hamiltonian\n0\nHLDA\n, is supplemented with the local Coulomb repulsion\nU and Hund's rule exchange J:\nXX\n0\nn\u0302im\u2191 n\u0302im\u2193\n\u0124 = \u0124LDA\n+ U\nm\n\n+\n\nX\n\na1g (iso.)\n\nU = 4.5 eV\n\n\u03c0\n\neg (iso.)\na1g (met.)\n\nIntensity in arbitraty units\n\n\u03c0\n\neg (met.)\na1g (iso.)\n\nU = 5.0 eV\n\n\u03c0\n\neg (iso.)\na1g (met.)\n\u03c0\n\neg (met.)\na1g (iso.)\n\nU = 5.5 eV\n\n\u03c0\n\neg (iso.)\na1g (met.)\n\u03c0\n\neg (met.)\n\ni\n\n(V \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u0303 J) n\u0302im\u03c3 n\u0302im\u0303\u03c3\u0303 .\n\n-4\n\n(1)\n\ni m6=m\u0303 \u03c3\u03c3\u0303\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n4\nEnergy (eV)\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 2.

The LDA and\nQMC curves are normalized differently since the e\u03c3g states,\nwhich are shifted towards higher energies when the Coulomb\ninteraction is included, are neglected in the QMC calculation.\n\nbitals. Thus we conclude that the spin state of V2 O3 is\nS = 1 throughout the Mott-Hubbard transition region.\nThis agrees with the measurements of Park et al. [9] and\nalso with the data for the high-temperature susceptibility [27]. The latter correspond to an effective magnetic\nmoment \u03bcef f = 2.66\u03bcB which is close to the ideal value\n\u03bcef f = 2.83\u03bcB for S = 1. The result is at odds with a\nS = 1/2 model and with the results for a one-band Hubbard model where m2z changes substantially at the MIT\n[3].\nFor the orbital degrees of freedom we find a predominant occupation of the e\u03c0g orbitals, but with a significant\nadmixture of a1g orbitals. This admixture decreases at\nthe MIT: in the metallic phase we determine the occupation of the (a1g , e\u03c0g1 , e\u03c0g2 ) orbitals as (0.37, 0.815, 0.815),\nand in the insulating phase as (0.28, 0.86, 0.86). This\nshould be compared with the experimental results of Park\net al. [9]. From their analysis of the linear dichroism data\nthe authors concluded that the ratio of the configurations\ne\u03c0g e\u03c0g :e\u03c0g a1g is equal to 1:1 for the paramagnetic metallic and 3:2 for the paramagnetic insulating phase, corresponding to a one-electron occupation of (0.5,0.75,0.75)\nand (0.4,0.8,0.8), respectively. Although our results show\na somewhat smaller value for the admixture of a1g orbitals, the overall behavior, including the tendency of a\ndecrease of the a1g admixture across the transition to the\ninsulating state, are well reproduced. This agrees with\nthe LDA+U calculation for the antiferromagnetic insulating phase [10]. Further experimental evidence for predominant (e\u03c0g , e\u03c0g ) configurations was obtained by polarized neutron diffraction by Brown et al. [28]. Measuring\nthe spatial distribution of the magnetization induced by\na magnetic field, they showed that the moment induced\non the V atoms is almost entirely due to the electrons in\nthe doubly degenerate e\u03c0g orbitals.\nIn conclusion, starting from the LDA-calculated spec-\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3. a) LDA+DMFT(QMC) spectrum for U = 4.5, 5\nand 5.5 eV at T = 1000 K; b) Comparison with the LDA spectrum and the photoemission experiment by Schramme et al.\n[25] for two different V2 O3 single-crystal surfaces at T = 300\nK. Note, that the (101\u03042) surface has the same coordination\nnumber as the bulk.\n\nnote that the DOS is highly asymmetric w.r.t the Fermi\nenergy due to the orbital degrees of freedom. The comparison between our results, the data of M\u00fcller et al. [26]\nobtained by X-ray absorption measurements, and LDA\nin Fig. 4 shows that, in contrast with LDA, our results\nnot only describe the different bandwidths above and below the Fermi energy (\u2248 6 eV and \u2248 2 \u2212 3 eV, respectively) correctly, but even resolve the two-peak structure\nabove the Fermi energy. Also the interpretation of the\ntwo peaks is different in LDA and LDA+DMFT(QMC).\nWhile in the latter approach the peak at lower energies\n(1 eV) has predominantly a1g character and the peak at\nhigher energy (3 eV) is due to the e\u03c0g Hubbard band (see\nFig. 2), in LDA the a1g and e\u03c0g states contribute only\nbelow 1.8 eV such that the second peak is entirely due\nto the e\u03c3g states (see Fig. 1). Particularly interesting\nare the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom in V2 O3 .\nWe find (not shown) that for U D>\n\u223cP3 eV the squared\nE\n2\n2\nlocal magnetic moment mz = ( m [n\u0302m\u2191 \u2212 n\u0302m\u2193 ])\nsaturates at a value of 4, i.e., there are two electrons\nwith the same spin direction in the (a1g , e\u03c0g1 , e\u03c0g2 ) or3\n\n\ftra for paramagnetic V2 O3 and (V0.962 Cr0.038 )2 O3 ,\nand including the missing electronic correlations via\nDMFT(QMC), we showed that a Mott-Hubbard MIT\noccurs in the paramagnetic phase at U \u2248 5eV. Our results are in very good agreement with the experimentally determined photoemission and X-ray absorption\nspectra, i.e., above and below the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we calculate the spin state to be S = 1 and\nfind an orbital admixture of e\u03c0g e\u03c0g and e\u03c0g a1g configurations, which both agree with recent experiments. Thus\nLDA+DMFT(QMC) provides a remarkably accurate microscopic theory of the strongly correlated electrons in\nthe paramagnetic phase of V2 O3 .\nThe MIT will eventually become first order at lower\ntemperatures [4,3]; QMC simulations at T \u2248 300 K are\nunder way, but are very computer-expensive. Furthermore, future ab initio investigations will have to clarify\nthe origin of the discontinuous lattice distortion at the\nfirst-order MIT which leaves the lattice symmetry unchanged. Here various scenarios are possible [29,30]. In\nparticular, the MIT might be the driving force behind the\nlattice distortion by causing a thermodynamic instability\nw.r.t. changes of the lattice volume and distortions.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with N.
