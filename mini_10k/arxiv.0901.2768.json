We refer to systems which achieve\nboth FR and FD simultaneously as FRFD systems. Nonorthogonal STBCs can achieve FRFD without feedback, but\ntheir ML decoding complexities are high. V-BLAST without\nprecoding achieves FR but not FD. FRFD can be achieved in VBLAST through precoding given full channel state information\nat the transmitter (CSIT). However, with limited feedback\nprecoding, V-BLAST achieves FD, but with some rate loss.\nOur contribution in this paper is two-fold: i) we propose\na limited feedback (LFB) precoding scheme which achieves\nFRFD in 2 \u00d7 2, 3 \u00d7 3 and 4 \u00d7 4 V-BLAST systems (we\nrefer to this scheme as FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme), and\nii) comparing the performances of the FRFD-VBLAST-LFB\nscheme and non-orthogonal STBCs without feedback (e.g.,\nGolden code, perfect codes) under ML decoding, we show that\nin 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system with 4-QAM/16-QAM, FRFD-VBLASTLFB scheme outperforms the Golden code by about 0.6 dB; in\n3 \u00d7 3 and 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO systems, the performance of FRFDVBLAST-LFB scheme is comparable to the performance of\nperfect codes. The FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme is attractive\nbecause 1) ML decoding becomes less complex compared to\nthat of non-orthogonal STBCs, 2) the number of feedback bits\nrequired to achieve the above performance is small, 3) in slowfading, it is adequate to send feedback bits only occasionally, and\n4) in most practical wireless systems feedback channel is often\navailable (e.g., for adaptive modulation, rate/power control).\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nMultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques can provide the benefits of spatial diversity and multiplexing gain\n[1]-[3]. Spatial multiplexing (V-BLAST) using Nt transmit\nantennas achieves the full-rate of Nt symbols per channel\nuse. However, full transmit diversity of order Nt is not\nachieved in V-BLAST. Orthogonal space-time block codes\n(e.g., 2 \u00d7 2 Alamouti code) achieve full transmit diversity,\nbut suffer from rate loss for increased number of antennas\n[2]. Achieving both full-rate (FR) and full-diversity (FD)\nsimultaneously is a desired goal in MIMO communications.\nWe refer to MIMO systems that simultaneously achieve both\nFR and FD as FRFD MIMO systems.\nOne way to achieve FRFD in MIMO systems is to employ\nnon-orthogonal STBCs [4]-[8], which offer the full-rate of\nNt symbols per channel use by having Nt2 symbols in\none Nt \u00d7 Nt STBC matrix, and full-diversity under ML\ndecoding. The 2 \u00d7 2 Golden code with 4 symbols in one\nSTBC matrix is a well known non-orthogonal STBC for\n2 transmit antennas [5]. A drawback with FRFD-achieving\nnon-orthogonal STBCs is their high decoding complexities,\nbecause ML decoding of these STBCs involves joint decoding of Nt2 symbols. ML decoding in V-BLAST, on the\nother hand, involves joint decoding of only Nt symbols. The\ninability of V-BLAST to achieve transmit diversity can be\novercome through the use of precoding at the transmitter\n[9]-[15]. Precoding based on knowledge of full channel\n\nstate information at the transmitter (CSIT) and first-/secondorder statistics of the channel have been studied widely\n[9]-[12]. With full CSIT precoding, FRFD can be achieved\nin V-BLAST [12]. However, in limited feedback precoding\nschemes in V-BLAST, FD is achieved, but with some loss in\nrate [13]-[15]. For e.g., the precoding scheme in [13] is based\non Grassmannian subspace packing, which does not allow\nsimultaneous transmission of more than Nt \u2212 1 streams (i.e.,\nachievable rate is \u2264 Nt \u2212 1 symbols per channel use). In a\n2\u00d72 MIMO system, this means a rate loss of 50%. The same\nis true with any other Grassmannian subspace packing based\nscheme or transmit antenna selection based scheme [15]. Our\ncontribution in this paper is two fold:\n\u2022 First, we present a limited feedback (LFB) based precoding scheme for V-BLAST which achieves FRFD in\nsmall systems like 2 \u00d7 2, 3 \u00d7 3, and 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO.\nSince the proposed scheme is not based on subspace\npacking or antenna selection, there is no loss in rate.\nThe proposed scheme involves the design of a codebook having a finite number (N ) of unitary precoding\nmatrices, which are generated from a unitary matrix\n(U\u03b8 ) parametrized by a single angular parameter, \u03b8 \u2208\n{ 2\u03c0n\nN , n = 0, * * * , N \u2212 1}. The receiver chooses the precoding matrix which maximizes the minimum distance\nwith ML decoding, and sends the corresponding index\nto the transmitter. We refer to the proposed scheme as\nFRFD-VBLAST LFB scheme.\n\u2022 Second, we present a BER performance comparison\nbetween the two FRFD-achieving schemes, namely,\nthe proposed FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme and nonorthogonal STBC MIMO using Golden/perfect codes\nunder ML decoding. Our simulation results show that\nin a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system with 4-QAM/16-QAM, the\nproposed FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme outperforms the\nGolden code by about 0.6 dB. In 3\u00d73 and 4\u00d74 MIMO,\nthe performance of FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme is\ncomparable to the performance of perfect codes.\nThe proposed FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme is attractive because 1) ML decoding becomes less complex compared to\nthat of non-orthogonal STBCs, 2) the number of feedback\nbits required to achieve the above performance is small,\n3) in slow-fading channels it is adequate to send feedback\nbits only occasionally, and 4) in most practical wireless\nsystems feedback channel is often available (e.g., for adaptive\nmodulation, rate/power control).\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\nII, we present the system model. The proposed limited\nfeedback precoding scheme is presented in Section III. BER\nperformance of the proposed scheme along with a performance comparison with Golden/perfect codes are presented\n\n\fin Section IV. Conclusions are presented in Section V.\n6\n\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\n\nLattice H\nLattice H'\n\nConsider a precoded V-BLAST system with Nt antennas\nat the transmitter and Nr antennas at the receiver. Let\nH \u2208 CNr \u00d7Nt denote the channel gain matrix, whose\nentries are i.i.d and CN (0, 1). Perfect knowledge of H is\nassumed at the receiver but not at the transmitter. Let F =\n{F0 , F1 , * * * , FN \u22121 } denote the precoder codebook of size\nN , where the Fn 's, n = 0, 1, * * * , N \u2212 1, are Nt \u00d7 Nt\nunitary precoding matrices. This codebook is known to both\ntransmitter and receiver. For a given channel H, the receiver\nchooses the precoding matrix from F that maximizes the\nminimum distance with ML decoding, and sends the corresponding index to the transmitter. Let B = \u2308log2 N \u2309 denote\nthe number of feedback bits needed to represent this index.\nGiven this index, k, the transmitter uses the corresponding\nprecoding matrix, denoted by F = Fk . Let x \u2208 ANt denote\nthe complex data symbol vector at the transmitter, where A\nis the modulation alphabet. The transmitted signal vector,\nu \u2208 CNt is given by u = Fx.

We, therefore, come up with the\nfollowing performance indicator for a given codebook:\n\u03bc(\u03b6N (UNt (\u03b8)) =\n2\nmax\n,i\u2208{0,*** ,N\u22121}\n\u03b8i = 2\u03c0i\nN\nEH 4\n\n(5)\n\u201a\n\u201a2 3\n\u201aHUNt (\u03b8i )(xj \u2212 xk )\u201a\nxj 6=xk ,xj ,xk \u2208ANt\n2\n5.\n\u201a\n\u201a2\nmin\n\u201a\n\u201a\nH(xj \u2212 xk ) 2\nxj 6=xk ,xj ,xk \u2208ANt\nmin\n\nIn words, \u03bc(\u03b6N (UNt (\u03b8)) is the expected ratio of the maximum squared dmin with precoding to that without precoding.\nThen, the optimal finite precoding codebook with B =\nopt\nlog2 N feedback bits is \u03b6N (Uopt\nNt (\u03b8)), where UNt (\u03b8) is given\nby\nargmax\nUopt\n\u03bc(\u03b6N (UNt (\u03b8)).

Hence, the optimum precoding\nmatrix chosen is given by\nFp\n\n=\n\nUNt (\u03b8)\n\n\u03b8= 2\u03c0p\nN\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nC. Receiver Processing: Feedback Computation and Signal\nDetection\nSignal detection is performed using the sphere decoding\nalgorithm [16]. In the following, we present the computation\nof dmin (H, i) in (10) for i = 0, 1, * * * N \u2212 1.\n\nWe can rewrite the system model equation (1) for the precoded system, when precoded with the ith precoding matrix\nas\ny = Hi x + n,\n(13)\n\u25b3\n\nwhere Hi = HUNt (\u03b8) \u03b8= 2\u03c0i . Using R{.} and I{.} to\nN\ndenote the real and imaginary parts of a complex argument,\nthe above equation can be transformed into an equivalent\nreal-valued model as\n\u1ef9 = H\u0303i x\u0303 + \u00f1,\nT\n\n(14)\nT\n\nwhere \u1ef9 = [R{yT } I{yT }] , x\u0303 = [R{xT } I{xT }] ,\nT\n\u00f1 = [R{nT } I{nT }] , and\n\u0014\n\u0015\nR{Hi } \u2212I{Hi }\nH\u0303i =\n.\n(15)\nI{Hi } R{Hi }\nHere, \u1ef9 \u2208 R2Nr \u00d71 , x\u0303 \u2208 S2Nt \u00d71 , \u00f1 \u2208 R2Nr \u00d71 and H\u0303i \u2208\nR2Nr \u00d72Nt . Also, S is the real PAM constellation corresponding to A. Henceforth, we shall work with the real-valued\nsystem in (14). With the new system model in (14), we can\nre-write (10) as\n\u201a\n\u201a\n \u0328\nmin\n\u201a\n\u201a\n\u201aHUNt (\u03b8) \u0328\u03b8= 2\u03c0i (xj \u2212 xk )\u201a\nN\nN\nxj , xk \u2208 A t , xj 6= xk\n2\n\u201a\n\u201a\nmin\n\u201a\n\u201a\n=\n\u201aH\u0303i (x\u0303j \u2212 x\u0303k )\u201a\n2\nx\u0303j , x\u0303k \u2208 S2Nt , x\u0303j 6= x\u0303k\n\u201a\n\u201a\nmin\n\u201a\n\u201a\n(16)\n=\n\u201aH\u0303i z\u201a ,\n2\nz \u2208 D2Nt , z 6= 0\n\n\u25b3\n\ndmin (H, i) =\n\nwhere D is the difference constellation of S. For example, for square\n\u221a M -QAM modulation, S is given\n\u221a by\n{\u00b11, \u00b13, .., \u00b1( M \u2212 1)} and D is {0, \u00b12, \u00b14, .., \u00b12( M \u2212\n\n1)}. Since the factor of 2 can be neglected,\n\u221a D can therefore\nbe taken to be D = {s : s \u2208 Z, |s| \u2264 ( M \u2212 1)}.\n\nGeometrically, H\u0303i defines a 2Nt dimensional lattice in R2Nr ,\ndenoted as \u039b = {H\u0303i z : z \u2208 Z2Nt } and a finite subset of\n\u039b is \u039b\u0303 = {H\u0303i z : z \u2208 D2Nt }. For the receiver to find the\noptimal precoding matrix, it needs to evaluate dmin (H, i)\nusing (16) for all i = 0, 1, * * * N \u2212 1. Given the geometrical\ninterpretation it is easy to see that calculation of (16) is\nequivalent to the problem of finding the shortest vector in\na finite subset of the lattice \u039b. This problem is a constrained\nversion of the well known shortest vector problem (SVP)\nfor any arbitrary lattice. Unconstrained SVP can be solved\nby appropriately modifying the closest lattice point search\nalgorithm, as discussed in [17]. We solve the constrained\nSVP problem by restricting the search to be within the finite\nsubset \u039b\u0303.\nIV. S IMULATION R ESULTS\nWe evaluated the BER performance of the proposed limited\nfeedback precoding scheme as a function of average received\nSNR per receive antenna, \u03b3, through simulations for Nt =\nNr = 2, 3, 4. For comparison purposes, we also evaluate the\nperformance of Golden code/perfect codes in MIMO systems\nwith Nt = Nr = 2, 3, 4.\nFigure 2 shows the simulation results for 2 \u00d7 2 and 4 \u00d7 4\nV-BLAST without and with the proposed precoding, for 4QAM and 16-QAM using sphere decoding. BER performance plots for different levels of quantization requiring different number of feedback bits (B = 8, 4, 3 bits) are shown.\nFrom Fig. 2, it is observed that the proposed precoding\nscheme achieves significantly better diversity than the 'no\nprecoding' scheme. In fact, a comparison of this precoded\nperformance for 2 \u00d7 2 V-BLAST with the performance\nof 2 \u00d7 2 Golden code in Fig. 3 shows that both these\ncurves run parallel illustrating that, just like Golden code,\nthe proposed scheme also achieves full diversity. Another\ninteresting observation in Fig. 2 is the effect of feedback\nbits on the BER performance. It can be seen that the BER\nwith B = 4 and B = 8 are almost the same, showing that\nthe performance in the proposed scheme remains robust even\nwith a nominal quantization of using 4 bits.\nNext, in Figs. 3 to 5, we compare the BER performances of\nthe proposed precoding scheme and the Golden code/perfect\ncodes in 2 \u00d7 2 (Fig. 3), 3 \u00d7 3 (Fig. 4), and 4 \u00d7 4 (Fig. 5)\nsystems, using sphere decoding. The channel is assumed to\nremain constant for Nt consecutive channel uses in V-BLAST\nin order to facilitate the comparison between V-BLAST and\nGolden code/perfect codes (which are assumed to have a\nquasi-static interval of Nt channel uses) under similar quasistatic channel conditions.\nFrom Fig. 3, it can be seen that, for both 4-QAM and\n16-QAM, the performance curves of the proposed scheme\nruns parallel to those of the Golden code, showing that\nthe proposed scheme achieves the full diversity of 4. It\nis interesting to further observe that the proposed scheme\nexhibits some coding gain advantage compared to the Golden\ncode. Particularly, the coding gain attained by the proposed\nscheme over Golden Code is about 0.7 dB at a BER of 10\u22123 .\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nV\u2212BLAST with LFB\nNt=Nr=2,4; 4\u2212QAM\nSphere decoding\n\n\u22121\n\n3 x 3 System\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nBit Error Rate\n\n10\n\nBit Error Rate\n\nV\u2212BLAST with LFB vs. Perfect code w/o FB\nNt=Nr=3; Sphere decoding\n4\u2212QAM for V\u2212BLAST\n4\u2212HEX for perfect code\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n2x2, No precoding\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n2x2, Proposed precoding, 8 bit FB\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n2x2, Proposed precoding, 4 bit FB\n\nV\u2212BLAST, No precoding\n\n2x2, Proposed precoding, 3 bit FB\n\nV\u2212BLAST, Proposed precoding, 8 bit FB\n\n4x4, No precoding\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\nV\u2212BLAST, Proposed precoding, 4 bit FB\n\n4x4, Proposed precoding, 8 bit FB\n\nPerfect Code\n\n4x4, Proposed precoding, 4 bit FB\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nAverage Received SNR (dB)\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nAverage Received SNR (dB)\n\nFig. 2.

Proposed scheme achieves\nfull-diversity; outperforms Golden code by about 0.6 dB.\n\nThis is significant since precoding achieves this better performance with a lower decoding complexity (joint detection\nof 2 symbols in one channel use) than the Golden code (joint\ndetection of 4 symbols in one STBC matrix).\nNext, the BER comparison in Fig. 4 for 3 \u00d7 3 system shows\nthat the proposed scheme achieves the same diversity as\nthat of 3 \u00d7 3 perfect code, but is inferior to perfect code\nin terms of coding gain. This performance gap, however,\nis small (about 0.3 dB). In 4 \u00d7 4 system in Fig. 5, the\nperformance gap in terms of coding gain is about 1 dB. This\nsuggests that better precoding strategies for larger Nt can be\ninvestigated to achieve close to perfect code performance. A\nlikely approach can be to consider multiple parameter based\nprecoder designs.\nA key advantage of the proposed precoder approach compared to the non-orthogonal STBC approach is its lesser\ndecoding complexity. This advantage is captured in the complexity comparison plots in Fig. 6, where the complexities\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nAverage Received SNR (dB)\nFig. 5.

Proposed scheme performs about 1\ndB away from perfect code.\n\nin both the approaches using sphere decoding, in terms of\nnumber of real operations per decoded symbol, are plotted\nas a function of Nt = Nr = 2, 3, 4 at SNRs corresponding to\na target BER of 10\u22122 . It can be seen that the complexity in\nthe proposed approach is much less because it needs to jointly\ndetect only Nt symbols, whereas in the non-orthogonal\nSTBC approach joint detection is over Nt2 symbols. We\nnote that the complexity comparison in Fig. 6 does not\ninclude the complexity involved in the optimization to choose\nthe optimum precoding matrix at the receiver. It is pointed\nout that the data decoding complexity dominates over the\nprecoding selection complexity, as decoding is done on a\nper channel use basis whereas, in slow fading, the precoding\nselection computation need not be carried out so frequently.\nV.

Decoding complexity\nin the proposed scheme is much less than in Golden code/perfect codes.\n\nThe proposed precoding scheme achieves full-rate for any\nNt by design, whereas the achievability of full-diversity was\nestablished through BER simulations for Nt = Nr = 2, 3, 4\nunder ML decoding for 4-QAM/16-QAM. Our simulation\nresults showed that in a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system, the proposed\nscheme outperformed the Golden code by about 0.6 dB. It\nperformed comparable to perfect codes in 3 \u00d7 3 and 4 \u00d7 4\nMIMO systems as well. The decoding complexity in the\nproposed scheme was shown to be much less compared to\nthat of Golden/perfect codes. It is noted that the feedback\nchannel is an additional resource required in precoding\nschemes. However, given that a feedback channel is often\navailable in most practical wireless systems (e.g., for adaptive\nmodulation, rate/power control, etc.), and that the feedback\nbandwidth required will be very less in slow fading, the\nproposed scheme can be quite attractive for its full-rate,\nfull-diversity, and low-complexity attributes. Investigations\nrelated to applicability of the proposed approach to large\nantenna systems using multiple-parameter based precoder\ndesigns can be carried out further.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] A.
