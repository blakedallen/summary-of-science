In this theoretical investigation, we focus on the\neffect that gradients in the macroscopic vertical velocity field have on the non-magnetic scattering\npolarization signals, establishing the basis for general cases. We demonstrate that the solar plasma\nvelocity gradients have a significant effect on the linear polarization produced by scattering in chromospheric spectral lines. In particular, we show the impact of velocity gradients on the anisotropy of the\nradiation field and on the ensuing fractional alignment of the Ca ii levels, and how they can lead to an\nenhancement of the zero-field linear polarization signals. This investigation remarks the importance\nof knowing the dynamical state of the solar atmosphere in order to correctly interpret spectropolarimetric measurements, which is important, among other things, for establishing a suitable zero field\nreference case to infer magnetic fields via the Hanle effect.\nSubject headings: Polarization - scattering - radiative transfer - Sun: chromosphere, quiet sun\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOver the last few years it has become increasingly\nclear that the determination of the magnetic field in the\n\"quiet\" solar chromosphere requires measuring and interpreting the linear polarization profiles produced by\nscattering in strong spectral lines, such as H\u03b1 and the\n8542 \u00c5 line of the infrared (IR) triplet of Ca ii (e.g., see\nreviews by Trujillo Bueno 2010 and Uitenbroek 2011). In\nthese chromospheric lines, the maximum fractional linear polarization signal occurs at the center of the spectral\nline under consideration, where the Hanle effect (i.e., the\nmagnetic-field-induced modification of the scattering line\npolarization) operates (Stenflo 1998). Since the opacity\nat the center of such chromospheric lines is very significant, it is natural to find that the response function\nof the emergent scattering polarization to magnetic field\nperturbations peaks in the upper chromosphere (\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n\n& Trujillo Bueno). This contrasts with the circular polarization signal caused by the Zeeman effect whose response function peaks at significantly lower atmospheric\nheights (Uitenbroek & Socas Navarro 2004). Of particular importance for developing the Hanle effect as a diagnostic tool of chromospheric magnetism is to understand\nand calculate reliably the linear polarization profiles corresponding to the zero-field reference case.\nThe physical origin of the scattering line polarization\nis atomic level polarization (that is, population imbalances and/or coherence between the magnetic sublevels\nof a degenerate level with total angular momentum J).\nAtomic polarization, in turn, is induced by anisotropic\nradiation pumping, which can be particularly efficient in\nthe low-density regions of stellar atmospheres where the\ndepolarizing role of elastic collisions tends to be negligible. The larger the anisotropy of the incident field,\necarlin@iac.es\n1 Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de Canarias, 38205, La Laguna,\nTenerife, Spain\n2 Departamento de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica, Universidad de La Laguna,\nTenerife, Spain\n3 Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u0131\u0301ficas, Spain\n\nthe larger the induced atomic level polarization, and the\nlarger the amplitude of the emergent linear polarization.\nThe degree of anisotropy of the spectral line radiation\nwithin the solar atmosphere depends on the center-tolimb variation (CLV) of the incident intensity. In a static\nmodel atmosphere the CLV of the incident intensity is\nestablished by the gradient of the source function of the\nspectral line under consideration (Trujillo Bueno 2001;\nLandi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi 2004). However, stellar\nchromospheres are highly dynamic systems, with shocks\nand wave motions (e.g., Carlsson & Stein 1997). The ensuing macroscopic velocity gradients and Doppler shifts\nmight have a significant impact on the radiation field\nanisotropy and, consequently, on the emergent polarization profiles. Therefore, it is important to investigate the\nextent to which macroscopic velocity gradients may modify the amplitude and shape of the emergent linear polarization profiles produced by optically pumped atoms\nin the solar atmosphere. The main aim of this first paper is to explain why atmospheric velocity gradients may\nmodify the anisotropy of the spectral line radiation and,\ntherefore, the emergent scattering line polarization. We\naim also at evaluating, with the help of ad-hoc velocity\nfields introduced in a semi-empirical solar model atmosphere, their possible impact on the scattering polarization of the IR triplet of Ca ii. A recent investigation by\nManso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno (2010), based on radiative\ntransfer calculations in static model atmospheres, shows\nwhy the differential Hanle effect in these lines is of great\npotential interest for the exploration of chromospheric\nmagnetism.\n2.

Moreover, since the problem we consider\nhere (plane-parallel, non-magnetic atmosphere with vertical velocity fields) is axially symmetric around the vertical direction, no coherences between different magnetic\nsublevels exist when the symmetry axis is taken for quantizing the angular momentum.

Due to the symmetry of the scattering\nprocess (no magnetic field, no polarized incident radiation in the atmosphere's boundaries), in a given level\nN+M = N\u2212M , and the excitation state of the system\nis described by just 9 independent sublevel populations.\nConsequently, odd-K elements (orientation components)\nin Equation 1 vanish for all five levels, and the only independent variables of the problem in the spherical components\n\u221aformalism are the total populations of the five levels ( 2J + 1\u03c100 ); the alignment components (\u03c120 ) of levels\n2, 3, and 5; and \u03c140 of level 3, whose role is negligible for\nour problem.\nThe statistical equilibrium equations accounting for\nthe radiative and collisional excitations and deexcitations in the 5-level system of Figure 1 are given explicitly in Manso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno (2010 ;hereafter\nMSTB2010). We have particularized them to the nocoherence case (only \u03c1K\n0 elements) in Appendix B. The\nstatistical equilibrium equations for the \u03c100 components\ncontain terms that are equal to those appearing in the\nstatistical equilibrium equations for the populations in a\nstandard (no polarization) NLTE problem (e.g., Mihalas\n1978), plus higher order terms \u223c J02 \u03c120 (see Eqs.

Numerical method\nThe solution to the non-LTE problem of the second kind considered here (the self-consistent solution\nof the statistical equilibrium equations for the density matrix elements together with the radiative transfer equations for the Stokes parameters) is carried out\nby generalizing the computer program developed by\nManso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno (2003), to allow for radial\nmacroscopic velocity fields. For integrating the RTE, a\nparabolic short-characteristics scheme (Kunasz & Auer\n1988) is used. At each iterative step, the radiative transfer equation is solved, and J \u030400 and J \u030402 are computed\nand used to solve the SEE following the accelarated\nLambda iteration method outlined in the Appendix of\nMSTB2010. Once the solution for the multipolar components of the density matrix is consistently reached, the\nemergent Stokes parameters are calculated for the desired line of sight, which in all the figures of this paper is\n\u03bc = 0.1. This final step is done increasing the frequency\ngrid resolution to a large value in order to correctly sample the small features and peaks of the emergent profiles.\nSome technical considerations have to be kept in mind\nfor the treatment of velocity fields. Due to the presence\nof Doppler shifts, the wavelength axis used to compute\nJ \u030400 and J \u030402 must include the required extension and resolution, because the spectral line radiation may be now\nshifted and asymmetric. In our strategy for the wavelength grid, the resolution is larger in the core than in the\nwings, keeping the same wavelength grid for all heights.\nThe cutoff wavelength for the core (where resolution\nis appreciably higher) is dictated by the maximum expected Doppler shift. Thus, the core bandwidth is estimated allowing for a range of 2Vmax around the zero\nvelocity central wavelength of the lines, with Vmax the\nmaximum velocity found in the atmosphere (in Doppler\nunits). Apart from that, a minimum typical resolution\nfor the core is set to 2 points per Doppler width (\u2206\u03bdD ).\nThen, the height with the smallest Doppler width determines the core resolution, and the height with the\nmaximum macro-velocity states its bandwidth.\nFurthermore, as frequencies and angles are inextricably entangled (through terms \u03bd \u2212 vz \u03bc\u03bd/c appearing in\nthe absortion/emission profiles due to the Doppler effect, like in Eq. (2)), the maximum angular increment\n(\u2206\u03bcmax ) is restricted by the maximum frequency increment (\u2206xmax \u2248 1/2, in Doppler units). Thus, it must occur that \u2206\u03bcmax *Vmax \u2264 1/2. In the worst case, the maximum allowed angular increment will be smaller (more\nangular resolution needed) when the maximum vertical\nvelocity increases. Besides this consideration, the maximum angular increment could be even more demanding\nbecause of the high sensitivity of the polarization profiles\nto the angular discretization.\nFinally, the depth grid must be fine enough, in such a\nway that the maximum difference in velocity between\nconsecutive points is not too large, the typical difference being equal to half the Doppler width (|V (zi ) \u2212\nV (zi\u22121 )| \u2264 1/2). If the difference is larger, the absortion/emission profiles would change abruptly with\nheight, producing imprecisions in the optical depth increments (Mihalas, 1978).\n\n\f4\n3. EFFECT OF A VELOCITY GRADIENT ON THE\nRADIATION FIELD ANISOTROPY AND THE MEAN\nINTENSITY\n\nAs we shall see, the presence of a vertical velocity gradient in an atmosphere enhances the anisotropy of the\nradiation field and, hence, of the scattering line polarization patterns. The fundamental process underlying this\nmechanism can be simply understood with the following\nbasic examples.\n3.1. Anisotropy seen by a moving scatterer.\n\nConsider an absorption spectral line with a Gaussian\nprofile emerging from a static atmosphere with a linear\nlimb darkening law,\nI(\u03bd, \u03bc) = I (0) (1 \u2212 u + u\u03bc)[1 \u2212 a exp(\u2212(\n\n\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 2\n) )], (10)\nw\n\nwhere I (0) is the continuum intensity at disk center, u\nis the limb darkening coefficient, a < 1 measures the\nintensity depression of the line, and w its width. In\nthis approximation we assume that all the parameters\nare constant. Now imagine that, at the top of the atmosphere, there is a thin cloud scattering the incident\nlight given by Eq. (10) and moving radially at velocity\nvz with respect to the bottom layers of the atmosphere,\nsupposed static. We will assume that the absorption profile is Gaussian (dominated by Doppler broadening), with\nwidth \u2206\u03bdD . When \u2206\u03bdD \u226a w, the incident spectral line\nradiation is much broader than the absorption profile (in\nfact, for \u03b1 = \u2206\u03bdD /w = 0 the absorption profile is formally a Dirac-\u03b4 function). Then, from Equations (2)-(3)\nwe can derive explicit expressions for the mean intensity and anisotropy of the radiation field as a function of\nthe scatterer velocity\n(see Appendix A): J \u030400 = I0 (\u03b1; \u03be)/2,\n\u221a\n2\nJ \u03040 = I2 (\u03b1; \u03be)/4 2, where the I0,2 functions are defined\nby Equations (A4)-(A5). The behaviour of J \u030400 and J \u030402\nwith the adimensional velocity \u03be = vz \u03bd0 /(cw) (Figure\n2), is most clearly illustrated in their asymptotic limits\nat low velocities:\n1\na\nJ \u030400 = (1 \u2212 \u221a\n)(2 \u2212 u)\n4\n1 + \u03b12\na(4 \u2212 u)\n\u03be 2 + O(\u03be 3 ),\n(11)\n+\n12(1 + \u03b12 )3/2\n\u221a J \u030402\nu\n2  \u03040 =\n4(2 \u2212 u)\nJ0\n+\n\na(64 \u2212 56u + 7u2 )\n\u221a\n\u03be 2 + O(\u03be 3 ).\n120(2 \u2212 u)2 (1 + \u03b12 )( 1 + \u03b12 \u2212 a)\n(12)\n\nEquation (11) shows that, for an absorption line (a > 0),\nJ \u030400 is always increasing with the velocity since the coefficient of \u03be 2 is positive, and this, regardless of the\nsign of vz (i.e., regardless of whether the scatterers\nmove upwards or downwards); if the line is in emission\n(a < 0), J \u030400 monotonically decreases. These are the\nDoppler brightening and Doppler dimming effects (e.g.,\nLandi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi 2004). An analogous\nanalysis applies to J \u030402 (Eq. 12). Note that, in the absence of limb darkening (u = 0), the anisotropy vanishes\nin a static atmosphere, while the mere presence of a rel-\n\n\u221a\nFig. 2.- J \u030400 /I (0) (upper panel) and 2J \u030402 /J \u030400 (lower panel) as\na function of the adimensional velocity \u03be calculated using an incident line profile as in Eq. (10) with u = 0.3 and a = 0.4 or 0.8\n(see labels). Dotted lines have been computed for the case of an\ninfinitely sharp absorption profile (\u03b1 = 0). Solid lines refer to the\ncase \u03b1 = 0.9 (non saturated line). The case with no limb darkening (u = 0) and a = 0.4 has been plotted for comparison (dashed\nlines).\n\native velocity between the scatterers and the underlying static atmosphere induces anisotropy in the radiation\nfield -hence, a polarization signal. A real atmosphere\ncould then be understood as a superposition of scatterers\nthat modify the anisotropy depending on the local velocity gradient and the illumination received from lower\nshells. An interesting discussion on the effect of velocities\nwith directions other than radial can be found in Landi\nDegl'Innocenti & Landolfi (2004; Section 12.4).\nClearly, all the above discussion depends on the\nDoppler shift induced by the velocity vz normalized to\nthe width of the spectral line, i.e., on \u03be. A large velocity gradient on a broad line has the same effect as that\nof a smaller velocity gradient on a narrow line. This is\nimportant to be kept in mind since the response of different spectral lines to the same velocity gradient will\nbe different, what can help us to decipher the velocity\nstratification. Even different spectral lines belonging to\n\n\f5\nthe same atomic species may have very different widths,\nas for example, the Ca ii IR triplet and the UV doublet\nstudied in the next section.\n3.2. Calculations in a Milne-Eddington model.\n\nThe discussion above explains the basic mechanism\nby means of which a velocity gradient enhances the\nanisotropy of the radiation field. Now we can get further insight on the structure of the radiation field within\nan atmosphere with velocity gradients from just the formal solution of the RT equation for the intensity (e.g.,\nMihalas 1978). As before, we neglect effects due to polarization and J00 and J02 are calculated from Stokes I\nalone. We consider a semi-infinite, plane-parallel atmosphere with a source function S = S0 (1 + \u03b2\u03c4l ), where\n\u03c4l is the integrated line optical depth in the static limit\n(hence, the element of optical depth d\u03c4\u03bd = (r + \u03c6[\u03bd(1 \u2212\nvz (\u03c4l )\u03bc/c)])d\u03c4l , where r = \u03bac /\u03bal is the ratio of continuum to line opacity). We begin by considering a vertical velocity field vz (\u03c4l ) = v0 /[1 + (\u03c4l /\u03c40 )] (positive\noutward the star), shown in Fig. 3. Equivalently, we\nmay express the velocity in adimensional terms by using\n\u03be = (\u03bd0 /c)vz /\u2206\u03bdD (the width \u2206\u03bdD of the Gaussian absorption profile is assumed to be constant with depth).\nThe parameter \u03c40 fixes the position of the maximum velocity gradient. Note that the wavelength dependence\nof the Doppler effect (\u2206\u03bbz = \u03bb0 vz /c) is cancelled in the\nadimensional problem, where velocities are measured in\nDoppler units. It is easy to calculate numerically Iz (\u03bd, \u03bc)\nat every point in the atmosphere and thus, the mean intensity and anisotropy of the radiation field (Figure 4).\nThe rise in J \u030400 in higher layers with respect to the static\ncase corresponds to the Doppler brightening discussed\nabove. Thanks to the Doppler shifts, the atoms see more\nand more of the brighter continuum below, which enhances J \u030400 . When the maximum velocity gradient takes\nplace at optically thick enough layers (\u03c40 & 1), J \u030400 is also\nlarger than for the static case, but it decreases monotonically with height in the atmosphere (\u03c40 = 102 , dotted\nlines in upper panel of Fig. 4). Note that the important quantity that modulates the increase in J \u030400 is not\n\nFig. 3.- Adimensional velocity fields considered in this section. They are parameterized by the limiting value at small optical\ndepths (labels) and by the location in optical depth of the largest\nvelocity gradient region (vertical lines marking \u03c40 ). Solid lines:\n\u03c40 = 1. Dotted lines: \u03c40 = 100.\n\n\u221a\nFig. 4.- J \u030400 (upper panel) and 2J \u030402 /J \u030400 (lower panel) as a\nfunction of the integrated static line opacity (\u03c4l ) in an expanding\natmosphere with S = S (0) (1 + \u03b2\u03c4l ) and different velocity stratifications \u03be = \u03be0 /(1 + \u03c4l /\u03c40 ) (see Fig. 3). The parameters used in this\nplot are \u03b2 = 3/2 and \u03bac /\u03bal = 10\u22124 . The labels indicate the value\nof \u03be0 . Solid lines correspond to \u03c40 = 1 while dotted lines refer to\n\u03c40 = 100.\n\nthe maximum velocity but the velocity gradient (difference in velocity between optically thick and optically thin\nparts of the atmosphere). The larger the gradient, the\nmore pronounced the radiative decoupling is between different heights. An extreme example of such radiative decoupling could be found in supernovae explosions, where\nthe vertical velocity gradients are huge.\nIn our case (vertical motions), the Doppler brightening implies an enhancement of the contribution of vertical radiation to Eq. (3) with respect to the horizontal\nradiation, with the latter remaining almost equal to the\nstatic case (no horizontal motions, no horizontal Doppler\nbrightening). This velocity-induced limb darkening is the\norigin of the anisotropy enhancement.\nHowever, note that the maximum anisotropy does not\nrise indefinitely when increasing the maximum velocity.\nIf the velocity gradient in units of the Doppler width is\nlarger than \u223c 3 (see curves for \u03bemax = 5 in Fig. 4), the\nanisotropy at the surface saturates and decreases (even\nbelow the curves corresponding to shorter velocity gradients). It is accompanied by a bump around \u03c4l = 1\nwhen the maximum velocity gradient is taking place at\nlow density layers (\u03c40 . 1). This behavior can be understood using Eq. (3). When \u03bemax . 3, an increment in\n\u03bemax entails a rise in J \u030400 , J \u030402 and J \u030402 /J \u030400 (wline ) in the upper atmosphere, what means that the velocity gradients\n\n\f6\nFor the considered velocity fields (with a negligible\ngradient in the upper atmosphere), J \u030400 and J \u030402 reach an\nasymptotic value in optically thin regions. We have verified that this effect does not occur if the velocity gradient\nis not zero in those layers. In any case, the presence of\na large anisotropy in optically thin heights barely affects\nthe emergent linear polarization profiles.\n3.3. Two-level model atom in dynamic atmospheres.\n\nFig. 5.- Same as Fig. 4 for an isothermal moving atmosphere\nwith a two-level atom model using the velocity fields of Fig. 3. We\nassume a very strong line (rc = 0) and \u01eb = 10\u22124 . Upper panel:\nthe Doppler brightening effect increases the surface source function\nvalue. In a two-level model atom in a static atmosphere\n\u221a (label 0)\nthis value follows the well known expression S(0) = \u01ebB. The\nvertical axis is in units of the Planck function. Lower panel: we\nshow the amplification of the radiation field anisotropy when the\nvelocity gradient increases. The vertical line marks the location of\nthe largest velocity gradient (\u03c4l = \u03c40 = 0.1). The curve labeled\nwith \"5\" shows the saturation of the anisotropy and the bump\nproduced by the strong velocity gradient taking place at optically\nthin regions.\n\nenhance the imbalance between vertical and horizontal\nradiation. However, if \u03bemax is above that threshold, J \u030400\nand J \u030402 rise, but the ratio J \u030402 /J \u030400 saturates and diminishes. The reason is that a large velocity gradient makes\nthe absorption profiles associated\nto almost horizontal\n\u221a\noutgoing rays (0 < \u03bc < 1/ 3) shifted so much that they\nalso capture the background continuum radiation. Their\ncontributions are negative to the angular integral of J \u030402\nbut positive for J \u030400 .\nSeparating\n\u221a the contributions of rays with angles in the\nrange 1/ 3 < |\u03bc| < 1 (that we refer to\u221awith the label +)\nand angles in the range 0 < |\u03bc| < 1/ 3 (that we refer\nto with the label \u2212), the line anisotropy can be written\n+\n\u2212\nas wline = wline\n+ wline\n= J \u030402+ /J \u030400 \u2212 |J \u030402\u2212 |/J \u030400 . Here, J \u030400\nand J \u030402+ grow always with \u03bemax , but |J \u030402\u2212 | only grows\nappreciably when \u03bemax & 3. Therefore, although wline\nincreases for all velocity gradients, its enhancement is\nsmaller for large velocity gradients than for smaller ones.\nThis effect occurs as well when motions take place deeper\n(\u03c40 & 1) but it is less important and the anisotropy bump\nand saturation are reduced.\n\nBefore going to a more realistic case, a final illustrative\nexample is considered. In this case, we assume the same\nparameterization of the velocities than in the previous example, but now we solve the complete iterative RT problem with a two-level atom model and a specific temperature stratification. Consequently, the source function\nand the anisotropy are consistently obtained in a moving atmosphere. The intensity source function is SI =\nr\u03bd\u03bc SIline + (1 \u2212 r\u03bd\u03bc )B (e.g., Rybicki & Hummer 1992),\nwith r\u03bd\u03bc = \u03c6\u2032lu (\u03bd, \u03bc)/(rc + \u03c6\u2032lu (\u03bd, \u03bc)) and the expression\nfor the line source function remains formally equal to that\nof the static case, being SIline = (1\u2212\u01eb)J \u030400 +\u01ebB, where B is\nthe imposed Planck function, \u01eb is the inelastic collisional\nparameter and J \u030400 is calculated with Eq. (2).\nThe qualitative behaviour explained in the previous\nsubsection is maintained in these two-level atom calculations. For small \u01eb values (large NLTE effects), the source\nfunction SI \u2248 J \u030400 shows Doppler brightening effects and\nits surface value depends on the maximum velocity gradient and on the maximum background continuum set\nby the photospheric conditions (upper panel in Fig. 5).\nThe anisotropy rises proportionally to the velocity gradient until a saturation occurs (lower panel in Fig. 5).\nA similar behavior is found when the maximum velocity\ngradient occurs higher in the atmosphere (see Fig. 10 in\nAppendix C).\nIn a static atmosphere, the radiation field anisotropy\nis dominated by the presence of gradients in the intensity source function (Trujillo Bueno 2001; Landi\nDegl'Innocenti & Landolfi 2004), which can be modified via the Planck function (equivalently, the temperature). In the dynamical case that we are dealing with,\nthe slope of the source function is also modified due to the\nexistence of velocity gradients thanks to the frequencydecoupling caused by relative motions between absortion\nprofiles (Doppler brightening). In general, both mechanisms act together (velocity-induced and temperatureinduced modification of the source function gradient) and\nthe ensuing anisotropy and the emergent linear polarization profiles are modified accordingly.\nIt is important to note that the adimensional velocity \u03be\ndepends both on the velocity and alsop\non the line Doppler\nwidth because \u03be(\u03c4 ) = \u03b4\u03bd/\u2206\u03bdD = vz / 2kB T /m, with kB\nthe Boltzmann constant, T the temperature and m the\nmass of the atom. In the photosphere, where velocities\nare much lower than in the chomosphere, \u03be is expected\nto be negligible. In the chromosphere, plasma motions\nare important and the temperature is still comparable to\nthat of the photosphere, inducing \u03be to be controlled by\nthe velocity field. However, for layers in the transition\nregion and above, the high temperatures reduce the value\nof \u03be. In any case, at these heights, the density is so low\nthat, although \u03be (and consequently the anisotropy) could\nhave a highly variable behaviour, the emergent polariza-\n\n\f7\n\n\u221a\nFig. 6.- Amplification of the line anisotropy (wline = 2J\u030420 /J\u030420 ) due to vertical velocity gradients.

RESULTS FOR THE CA II IR TRIPLET .\n\nNow, we study the effect of the velocity field on a\nmultilevel atomic system in a realistic atmospheric\nmodel, within the more general framework described\nin Sec. 2. We consider the formation of the scattering\npolarization pattern of the Ca ii infrared triplet in\na semi-empirical model atmosphere (FAL-C model of\nFontenla, Avrett, and Loeser 1993) in the presence\nof vertical velocity fields (v = vz (z)k, with k the\nunit vector along the vertical pointing upwards). We\nwill assume a constant microturbulent velocity field\nof 3.5 km s\u22121 , a representative value for the region\nof formation which gives a realistic broadening of the\ntriplet profiles.\n4.1. Behaviour of the anisotropy in the Ca ii IR triplet\n\nFor simplicity, we set linear velocity fields (constant\nvelocity gradient along z) between z = \u2212100 and 2150\nkm (see Fig. 6). Consequently, the adimensional velocity\nfield \u03bez has a non-monotonic behavior due to its dependence on the temperature (upper right panel in Fig. 6).\nIn the chromosphere, where the Ca ii triplet lines form,\n\u03bez is dominated by the macroscopic motions. Here, the\nvelocity gradients produce variations in the anisotropy of\nthe triplet lines that agree with the behaviour outlined\nin the previous sections. Namely, an amplification and\na subsequent saturation of the anisotropy factor due to\nthe significant velocity gradient at those heights (see the\nlower panels and middle right panel in Fig. 6). Above the\nchromosphere, on the contrary, the temperature dominates (\u03bez stabilizes and diminishes) and the anisotropy\nslightly decreases with height.\nIf the (adimensional) velocity gradient is negligible\n\u223c 1), the anisotropy\nwhere the line forms (around \u03c4\u03bdlos\n0\nremains unaffected. Otherwise, if a spectral line forms\nat very hot layers, where the absortion profiles are wider\nand their sensitivity to the velocity gradients is lower, the\nDoppler brightening will not be so efficient amplifying the\nanisotropy. This is the case of the anisotropy of the Ca\nii K line (middle left panel in Fig. 6). Compare how the\nslope of \u03bez is smaller where the Ca ii K line forms (black\nline on Fig. 6) than where the triplet lines do. Consequently, the enhancement of the line anisotropy through\nthe presence of velocity gradients in this line is reduced.\nAll our calculations demonstrate that the anisotropy\nin the Ca ii IR triplet can be amplified through chromospheric vertical velocity gradients. This results suggest\nthat the same occurs with the ensuing linear polarization\nprofiles.\n4.2. The impact on the polarization of the emergent\n\nradiation.\nFor investigating the effect of vertical velocity fields on\nthe emergent fractional polarization profiles we perform\nthe following numerical experiments. First, we impose\nvelocity gradients with the same absolute value but opposite signs (top left panel of Fig. 7). The resulting\nemergent Q/I profiles (remaining left panels of Fig. 7)\nare magnified by a significant factor (> 2 for all the transitions) with respect to the static case (black dotted line).\n\nThe linear polarization profiles have the same amplitude,\nindependently of the sign of the velocity gradient. Another remarkable feature is the asymmetry of the profiles,\nhaving a higher blue wing in those cases in which the velocity gradient is positive and a higher red wing when\nthe velocity gradient is negative, independently of the\nvelocity sign. Note also that the Q/I profile is shifted in\nfrequency due to the relative velocity between the plasma\nand the observer.\nAs a second experiment, we consider different velocity\nfields with increasing gradients (right upper panel in Fig.\n7). In the ensuing Q/I profiles we see that the larger the\nvelocity gradient, the larger the frequency shift of the\nemergent profiles and the larger the amplitude. In all\ntransitions, one of the lateral lobes of the signal remains\nalmost constant. Thus, what really changes is the central\npart of the profiles, being a \"valley\" in the \u03bb8498 line and\na \"peak\" in the other two transitions. To quantify these\nvariations, we define (Q/I)pp (peak-to-peak amplitude of\nQ/I) as the difference between the lowest and the highest\nvalue of the emergent Q/I signal, which is also a measure\nof its contrast. Note that, as expected from the first\nexperiment, (Q/I)pp depends only on the absolute value\nof the gradient. Figure 8 summarizes these results.\nThe sensitivity of the linear polarization to the velocity gradient can be measured approximately as commented in Sec. 3.1, using a parameter \u03b1 = \u2206\u03bdD /w\nthat accounts for the difference in width of the absorption profile with respect to the emergent intensity profile. If \u03b1 \u223c 1, small adimensional velocities will produce\nlarge changes in shape; if \u03b1 \u226a 1, much larger \u03bez values\nare needed for the same effect. In the case of the IR\ntriplet lines, \u03b1 \u223c 0.355 in the formation region of \u03bb8498\nand around 0.29 and 0.285 in the formation region of\n\u03bb8542 and \u03bb8662 (having wider profiles), respectively.\nThen, the former is more sensitive to velocity variations\nin its formation region (Fig. 8). Finally, the K line has\n= 1) \u223c 0.015, a low value due to its wider spectral\n\u03b1 (\u03c4\u03bdlos\n0\nwings.\nThe enhancement of the polarization signals are a consequence of the increase in the anisotropy. Therefore,\nsince this increase is produced by the presence of velocity\nfields, the polarization signals of the Ca ii IR triplet are\nsensitive also to the dynamic state of the chromosphere.\n4.3. Variations on the atomic alignment due to velocity\n\ngradients.\nIn order to get physical insight on the formation of the\nemergent polarization profiles, we use an analytical approximation. Following Trujillo Bueno (2003), the emergent fractional linear polarization for a strong line at the\ncentral wavelength can be approximated with:\ni\nh\n3\nQ\n(2)\n(2)\n\u2248 \u221a (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) wJu Jl * \u03c302 (Ju ) \u2212 wJl Ju * \u03c302 (Jl ) .\nI\n2 2\n(13)\n(2)\nThe symbols wJJ \u2032 are numerical coefficients already introduced in Sec. 2. The quantities \u03c302 (Ju ) and \u03c302 (Jl ) are\nthe fractional alignment coefficients (\u03c302 = \u03c120 /\u03c100 ) evaluated at \u03c4\u03bdlos = 1 for the upper and lower level of the\ntransition, respectively. This is the generalization of the\nEddington-Barbier (EB) aproximation to the scattering\npolarization and establishes that changes in linear polar-\n\n\f9\n\nFig. 7.- Left panels: calculation at \u03bc = 0.1 of the emergent Q/I polarization signals of the Ca ii IR triplet when four different choices\nfor the vertical velocity gradients are imposed. Positive velocities imply upflowing plasma. Gradient \"a\"/\"b\" simulates an atmosphere\nwhere the plasma is entirely moving towards the observer increasing/decreasing linearly the velocity along the outgoing z axis. Gradients\n\"c\" and \"d\" are the same for plasma moving away from the observer. The black dotted line is the solution for the static reference case.\nEach curve is computed on the converged solution of the multilevel NLTE problem described in Sec. 2. Right panels: same calculations\nthan in the left-hand panels, but with different velocity gradient values varying from 0 to 16.3 m s\u22121 km\u22121 in steps of 2.3 m s\u22121 km\u22121 (see\ntop right panel). These results show that the polarization signals are increased and shifted with respect to the static case depending only\non the absolute value of the vertical velocity field gradient and independently of the sign of the velocity field.\n\nization (for a static case) are induced by changes in the\natomic aligment of the energy levels.\nOur calculations show that vertical velocity fields with\nmoderate gradients (. 10 m s\u22121 km\u22121 in a linear velocity\nfield, as the ones shown in the figures) do indeed produce\nvariations in the fractional alignment, which are small\nfor |\u03c302 (Ju )| and significant for |\u03c302 (Jl )| (see Fig. 9). The\n\nlower level alignment is the main driver of the changes\nproduced in the Q/I signals. This is strictly true for the\n\u03bb8662 line, whose upper level with J = 1/2 cannot be\naligned (zero field dichroism polarization). In the other\ntransitions, a certain influence of the upper level alignment becomes important only for large gradients. The\nreason is that the K transition is so strong in comparison\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 8.- (Q/I)pp normalized to the static case solution versus\nthe velocity gradient (bottom axis) and the maximum absolute\nvelocity (top axis) for linear velocity fields appearing in Fig. 7. The\nresults are invariant under velocity sign changes. The transition\n\u03bb8498 is more sensitive to velocity variations due to its thinner\nabsortion profile.\n\nwith the IR triplet that it is dictating the common upper\nlevel 5 alignment (Fig. 1). In fact, \u03c302 (J5 ) is driven by\nthe K line anisotropy which, at cromospheric heights, is\nalmost unaffected for the considered velocity gradients,\nas we discussed in Sec. 4.1 (Fig. 6). Thus, the strong\nH and K lines feed population to the upper levels and\nthe K line controls the alignment of the 2 P3/2 level (see\nFig. 1), while the polarization signals of the IR triplet\nchange with velocity fields affecting \u03c302 (Jl ) (through the\nanisotropy enhancement).\nTo illustrate the well-known link between the alignment and the anisotropy we can follow the next reasoning. For the Ca ii model atom that we deal with in this\nwork, it is posible to derive a simple analytic expression\nthat relates the anisotropy and the alignments for the\n\u03bb8542 transition. Making use of Eqs. (B4) and (B5)\nand neglecting second order terms and collisions, we find\nthat:\n\u221a\n2\u03c302 (J5 ) \u2212 7\u03c302 (J3 ) \u2243 wline (3 \u2192 5).\n(14)\nAs before, we can roughly assume that \u03c302 (J5 ) \u223c constant\nat the chromosphere because it is controled by the K line.\nThen, Eq. (14) suggests that, if the radiation anisotropy\nincreases at that heights, an amplification of |\u03c302 (J3 )| occurs (note that \u03c302 (J3 ) is negative for these lines). A\nmore aligned atomic population produce a more intense\nscattering polarization signal.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWhen vertical velocity gradients exist, the polarization\nprofiles are always shifted in wavelength, asymmetrized\nand enhanced in amplitude with respect to the constant velocity case. The reason is that increments in\nthe absolute value of the velocity gradient increase the\nsource function (Doppler brightening) and enhance the\nanisotropy of the radiation field (Secs. 3 and 4), that\nin turn modify the fractional alignment (Sec. 4.3) and\namplify the scattering polarization profiles (Sec. 4.2).\n\nFor this very reason, all calculations assuming static\nmodels in the formation region might underestimate the\nscattering polarization amplitudes and not capture the\nright shape of the profiles. In particular, it must be\ntaken into account that the Ca ii IR triplet lines form under non-LTE conditions in chromospheric regions, where\nvelocity gradient may be significantly large due to the\nupward propagation of waves in a vertically stratified\natmosphere (e.g., Carlsson & Stein 1997). Probably,\nin photospheric and transition region lines the effect of\nvelocities on polarization can be safely neglected (they\nwill be predominantly amplified by temperature gradients as discussed in Sec. 3.3), but not necessarily in\nthe chromosphere. In our study we see that the \u03bb8498\nline is more sensitive to macroscopic motions in the lowchromosphere, while the \u03bb8542 and \u03bb8662 lines are especially amplified when strong velocity gradients are found\nat heights around 1.5 Mm and higher in our model.\nAt the light of these results, it is obvious that the effect\nof the velocity might be of relevance for measuring chromospheric magnetic fields. In particular, the described\nmechanism might turn out to be important for the correct interpretation of polarization signals in the Sun with\nthe Hanle effect. Given that weak chromospheric magnetic fields are inferred with the Hanle effect using the\ndifference between the observed linear polarization signal\nand the signal that would be produced in the absence of\na magnetic field, it is crucial to correctly compute the\nreference no-magnetic signal. In the Ca ii IR triplet, it\ncould be possible to break the degeneracy of the combined effects by taking into account the different sensitivities of the three lines of the triplet to the magnetic\nfield and the thermodynamics. As stated by MSTB2010,\nthe \u03bb8498 line is very sensitive to the thermal structure\nof the atmosphere. Likewise, the response of this line to\nthe velocity gradient is also higher than in the other two.\nThen, a first step could be to characterize the response of\nall the lines to combined variations of the temperature,\nvelocity and magnetic field and find observables (i.e., amplitude ratios) that are as insensitive to the temperature\nand velocity as possible and as sensitive to the magnetic\nfield as possible. We are currently carrying out this study\non realistic velocity fields, including shocks and temporal\nvariations.\nThe polarization amplification mechanism that we\nhave discussed in this paper is not limited to planeparallel atmospheres, although its effect is surely more\nimportant in plane-parallel atmospheres than in threedimensional ones. The reason is that i) gradients in a\nthree-dimensional atmosphere are weaker given the increased degrees of freedom and ii) non-resolved motions\nor large variations in velocity direction along the medium\nmix the contribution of different layers and broaden the\nprofiles, diminishing them in amplitude. In any case,\nstrong three-dimensional velocity gradients might create preferred directions along which the plasma becomes\nmore optically thin through the radiative uncoupling\nmechanism discussed in this paper.\nThe amplification of the radiation field anisotropy\nthrough vertical velocity gradients is a general and interesting phenomenon that improves our understanding\nof the stellar atmospheres. With the present investigation we have obtained some feeling about the formation\nof the Ca ii IR triplet in dynamic situations.\n\n\f11\n\nFig. 9.- Behaviour of the fractional alignments \u03c302 (Ju ) (green) and \u03c302 (Jl ) (red) of each Ca ii IR triplet transition for three of the velocity\nfields shown in Fig. 7.

We assume a very strong line (rc = 0) and\n\u01eb = 10\u22124 . The highest velocity gradient occur at \u03c4l = \u03c40 = 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 for a, b, c, d and e, respectively. The case f corresponds to\nthe solution in a static atmosphere. The vertical dotted line marks the position of \u03c4l = 1.\n\n\f14\nFinancial support by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through projects AYA2010-18029 (Solar\nMagnetism and Astrophysical Spectropolarimetry) and CONSOLIDER INGENIO CSD2009-00038 (Molecular Astrophysics: The Herschel and Alma Era) is gratefully acknowledged.\nREFERENCES\nBrink, D.
