In the last one and a\nhalf decade, and especially in the recent years, the problem of zero-point ST has\nevolved into a really hot subfield of low-temperature physics [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,\n12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In this work, we summarize theoretical developments of the two authors on the theory of decay of ST at\nT = 0, previously published in a number of short papers/letters [13, 14, 15, 21, 23].\nTo render the discussion self-contained, we also review the analysis of Ref. [5],\nwhere a number of conceptually important facts about zero-point ST has been\nrevealed.\nSuperfluid turbulence (ST) can be created in a number of ways: (i) in the\ncounter-flow of normal and superfluid components [27, 28] (ii) by vibrating objects [7, 16, 17, 26], (iii) as a result of macroscopic motion of a superfluid (referred to as quasi-classical turbulence), in which case ST can mimic, at large\nenough length scales, classical-fluid turbulence [16, 29, 6, 30, 31, 18, 19, 24], (iv)\nin the process of (strongly) non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation [32, 33],\nin which case it is a manifestation of generic Kibble-Zurek effect [34].\nDuring about four decades-from mid fifties till mid nineties-ST turbulence\nwas intensively studied in the context of counter-flow of normal and superfluid\ncomponents. An impressive success has been achieved in the field, with the prominent contributions by Vinen-the equation for qualitative description of growth/\ndecay kinetics (Vinen's equation), extensive experimental studies [27],-and pioneering microscopic simulations of vortex line dynamics by Schwartz [28]. The\ncounter-flow setup naturally implies finite density of the normal component, and\nthus a relatively simple-by comparison with the T = 0 case-relaxation mechanism. The normal component exerts a drag force on a vortex filament. As a result,\nthe vortex line length decreases. For an illustration, consider a vortex circle of\nthe radius R. In the absence of normal component, the ring moves with a constant velocity V \u2261 V (R), the radius R remaining constant. With the drag force, the\nring collapses, obeying a simple law \u1e58 \u221d \u2212\u03b1 V (R), where \u03b1 is the dimensionless\nfriction coefficient measuring the drag force in the units of Magnus force. Similarly, the drag causes the decay of Kelvin waves-precessing distortions on the\nvortex filaments-and the value of \u03b1 \u22121 gives the number of revolutions a distortion makes before its amplitude significantly decreases. At \u03b1 \u223c 1, the decay\nscenario of a (non-structured) vortex tangle is as follows. The vortex lines reconnect producing the distortions (Kelvin waves), these distortions decay due to the\ndrag force thereby reducing the total line length and rendering the tangle more and\nmore dilute.\nIn contrast to the counter-flow setup, where the case \u03b1 \u226a 1 can be considered\nrather specific, for the non-equilibrium process of Bose-Einstein condensation in\na weakly interacting gas, the regime \u03b1 \u226a 1 is quite characteristic in view of the\nfollowing circumstance. The condensation kinetics is a classical-field process the\nessential part of which is quantitatively captured by the time dependent GrossPitaevskii equation (a.k.a. non-linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation). Hence, the most natural setup is when the initial condition for the process features large occupation\nnumbers for the bosons, and the whole process can be accurately described by the\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1 Formation of superfluid turbulence in the process of strongly non-equilibrium kinetics of\nBose-Einstein condensation governed by Gross-Pitaevskii equation, as simulated in Ref. [32].\n\nGross-Pitaevskii equation from the very outset (see Fig. 1 for an illustration). In\nthe idealized situation of the classical field, the final temperature asymptotically\napproaches zero in view of the ultraviolet catastrophe. Another situation where\nthe regime \u03b1 \u226a 1 occurs naturally is the quasi-classical turbulence, which, unlike\ncounterflow turbulence, is due to a macroscopic turbulent motion and is generated\nby purely classical means at arbitrary temperatures without the help of mutual\nfriction.\nAt \u03b1 \u226a 1 (\u03b1 \u221d T 5 at T \u2192 0, see Ref. [35]), dynamics of vortex lines in a\nsignificant range of length scales become essentially conservative. In this case, relaxation of turbulent motion in non-linear systems usually involves certain types\nof cascades. In both classical and superfluid turbulence the key role is played by\nthe cascade of energy in the wavenumber space towards high wavenumbers. A\nrealization of this peculiar relaxation regime is due to the following conditions\nsatisfied by the system: (i) \u03bben \u226b \u03bbcutoff -a substantial separation of the energycontaining scale \u03bben from the scale \u03bbcutoff where the dissipation becomes appreciable, which defines the cascade inertial range \u03bben > \u03bb > \u03bbcutoff , (ii) the kinetics\nare local in the wavenumber space, i.e. the energy exchange is mainly between\nadjacent length scales, and (iii) the \"collisional\" kinetic time \u03c4coll (\u03bb )-the time\nbetween elementary events of energy exchange at a certain scale \u03bb -gets progressively shorter down the scales. These requirements determine the main qualitative\nfeatures of the cascade: The decay is governed by the slowest kinetics at \u03bben ,\nwhere the energy flux \u03b5 in the wavenumber space is formed, while the faster kinetic processes at shorter scales are able to instantly adjust to this flux supporting\nthe transfer of energy towards \u03bbcutoff , where it is dissipated into heat. Thus, the\ncascade is a (quasi-)steady-state regime in which the energy flux \u03b5 is constant\n\n\f4\n\nthrough the length scales and the variation of \u03b5 in time happens on the longest\ntime scale \u223c \u03c4coll (\u03bben ).\nWith vortex lines, one can think of quite a number of different cascades. Perhaps the most obvious one is the Richardson-Kolmogorov cascade of eddies,\nwhich can be realized in a superfluid (even at T = 0) due to its ability to emulate the classical-fluid turbulent motion by the motion of a polarized vortex-line\ntangle. Clearly, this type of the cascade is fundamentally impossible in the nonstructured Kibble-Zurek-type tangle. For quite a long time it was believed that\nnon-structured ST decays at T = 0 through the Feynman's cascade of vortex rings\n[36]. Feynman conjectured that reconnections of the vortex lines produce vortex\nrings, with subsequent decay of each ring into a pair of smaller rings, and so forth.\nIt can be shown, however, that this conjecture is inconsistent with simultaneous\nconservation of energy and momentum (see Ref. [5] and Sec. 4). Another obvious\noption is a cascade of Kelvin waves supported by non-linear interaction (scattering) of kelvons. While such a cascade is indeed possible (see Ref. [13] and Sec. 3),\nit is subject to a peculiar constraint on the maximal energy flux. The origin of this\nconstraint is the approximate integrability of the vortex dynamics controlled by\nthe large parameter\n\u039b = ln(\u03bb /a0 ),\n(1)\nwhere \u03bb is the characteristic kelvon wavelength and a0 is the vortex core radius.\nIf the parameter \u039b is large, then the leading term of the Kelvin-wave dynamics is\ngiven by the so-called local induction approximation (LIA) in which the velocity\nof an element of the vortex line is due to local differential properties of the line.\nThe LIA dynamics turns out to be integrable, so that mere non-linearity of the LIA\nequations of motion does not lead to the Kelvin-wave cascade. This circumstance\npredetermines the existence of intermediate cascades that are necessary to transfer\nthe energy to the wavenumbers high enough for the pure Kelvin-wave cascade to\ntake over. All the intermediate cascades have to involve reconnections, to lift the\nconstraint imposed by the integrability of LIA. In the non-structured tangle, there\nis only one type of reconnection-induced cascade. An elementary step of this cascade at the wavelength \u03bb consists of two adjacent events: (i) emission of a vortex\nring with the radius \u223c \u03bb by a local self-crossing of a kinky vortex line and (ii)\nre-absorbtion of the ring by the tangle. Both events are accompanied by transferring Kelvin-wave energy to shorter wavelengths (but still on the order of \u03bb ), since\nreconnections of the vortex loops produce Kelvin-wave structure with wavelength\nsmaller than the loop radii. For the self-reconnection cascade to be efficient, the\nvortex line has to be kinky (loosely speaking, fractalized) at all relevant length\nscales. Due to the integrability of LIA, the fractalization is provided by the cascade itself: In the absence of self-crossings at a given length scale, the amplitude\nof Kelvin waves keeps growing due to self-crossings at larger length scales. It is\nworth emphasizing that in contrast to Feynman's scenario, where the vortex rings\nare the energy carriers, in the local self-crossing scenario, the rings play only a\nsupportive role. In the process (i) a ring is just a product of self-crossing and in\nthe process (ii) the ring is just a cause of yet another reconnection event. Clearly,\nthe crucial part is played by Kelvin waves, which carry the energy, and reconnections, which directly promote the Kelvin-wave cascade.\nIn the polarized tangle emulating the Richardson-Kolmogorov classical-fluid\ncascade, there are two more varieties of reconnection-supported Kelvin-wave cas-\n\n\f5\n\ncades. One is when reconnections are between the bundles of quasi-parallel vortex\nlines, and the other one when the reconnections are between two neighboring lines\nin a bundle. In Sec. 5 we present the arguments [21] that in the theoretical limit of\n\u039b \u2192 \u221e, all the three reconnection driven cascades are necessary to cross over from\nRichardson-Kolmogorov to pure Kelvin-wave regime, the crossover being a series\nof three distinct cascades: bundle driven, neighboring reconnection driven, and local self-crossing driven. The total extent of the crossover regime in the Kelvin\nwavenumber space is predicted to be \u223c \u039b /10 decades. With realistic \u039b . 15 (for\n4 He), this means that the crossover takes about one decade, within which one can\nhardly expect sharp distinctions between the three different regimes.\nAt T = 0, the reconnection-supported cascade(s) ultimately crosses over to the\npure Kelvin-wave cascade, and the latter is cut off by phonon emission [8, 10, 15].\nThe elementary process of phonon emission converts two kelvons with almost\nopposite momenta into one bulk phonon [15].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we render basic equations and notions of vortex dynamics: Biot-Savart equation and the LIA, Hasimoto\nrepresentation for the LIA in terms of curvature and torsion, conservation of energy and momentum, Hamiltonian formalism for the Kelvin waves, conservation\nof angular momentum, implying conservation of the total number of kelvons. We\npay special attention to the problem of ultraviolet regularization of the theory,\ncrucial for an adequate treatment of non-local corrections to the LIA. In Sec. 3\nwe develop a theory of the pure Kelvin-wave cascade (supported by elastic scattering of three kelvons-the leading non-trivial scattering event consistent with\nconservation of energy, momentum, and the total number of kelvons). We show\nthat the leading term in the three-kelvon scattering amplitude does not contain local contributions, in accordance with the integrability of LIA. We then find the\nspectrum and energy flux of the pure cascade. In Sec. 4 we analyze the scenario\nof local self-crossings, starting with the explanation why pure Feynman's cascade\ncannot be realized in view of conservation of momentum and energy. We show\nthat this scenario implies fratalization of the vortex lines, and derive corresponding spectrum of Kelvin waves. We then discuss a simple Hamiltonian model [5]\nfeaturing a collapse-driven cascade in otherwise integrable system, and argue why\nthe spectrum of the cascade in this model is similar to the one in the scenario\nof local self-crossings. In Sec. 5 we address the problem of the crossover from\nRichardson-Kolmogorov to Kelvin-wave cascade. Sec. 6 is devoted to the theory\nof kelvon-phonon interaction. Starting from the hydrodynamical Lagrangian, we\nderive the Hamiltonian of kelvon-phonon interaction. The Hamiltonian allows us\nto straightforwardly formulate kinetics of the kelvon-phonon processes, and, in\nparticular, find the cutoff momentum for the pure Kelvin-wave cascade. In Sec. 7\nwe summarize the main qualitative aspects of the theory and put our findings in\nthe context of experiment and simulations, including the ones that are still missing. We also formulate certain theoretical questions to be addressed in the future. Finally, we critically discuss the concept of bottleneck between RichardsonKolmogorov and Kelvin-wave cascades, put forward recently in Ref. [20] (see also\nRef. [22]), which we disagree with on the basis of our theoretical analysis.\n\n\f6\n\n2 Basic relations\n2.1 Biot-Savart law.

Therefore, one can apply the Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem of classical\nhydrodynamics-stating that the vortices move with the local fluid velicity-to\nobtain a closed dynamic equation for vortex filaments in a superfluid. Alternatively, one can start with the hydrodynamic action for the complex-valued field\nand derive the equation of vortex motion from the least-action principle. In the\npresent section, we use the former approach, readily yielding the answer. [The latter approach will be used in Sec. 6.1, where it will prove crucial for describing the\nvortex-phonon interaction.]\nIf the vortex lines are the only degrees of freedom excited in the fluid, and if the\ntypical curvature radius and interline separations are much larger than the vortex\ncore size, a0 , then the instant velocity field at distances much larger than a0 from\nthe vortex lines is defined by the form of the vortex line configuration. Indeed,\naway from the vortex core the density is practically constant and the hydrodynamic\ncontinuity equation reduces to\n\u2207*v = 0 .\n(2)\nThen, taking into account that \u2207 \u00d7 v = 0 everywhere except for the vortex lines,\nand that for any (positively oriented) contour \u0393 surrounding one vortex line\nI\n\n\u0393\n\nv * dl = \u03ba ,\n\n(3)\n\nwe note a direct analogy of our problem with the magnetostatic problem of finding\nmagnetic field produced by thin wires: Velocity field is identified with the magnetic field, and the absolute value of the current of each wire is one and the same\nand is proportional to \u03ba . The result is given by the Biot-Savart formula\nv(r) =\n\n\u03ba\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nds \u00d7 (r \u2212 s)\n,\n|r \u2212 s|3\n\n(4)\n\nwhere radius-vector s runs along all the vortex filaments.\nAccording to Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem, each piece of the vortex line should\nmove with a velocity corresponding to the velocity of the net motion of small\ncontour (of the size, say, of order a0 ) surrounding this element. This fact is very\nimportant, since the velocity field (4) is singular at all points on the vortex line, and\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem yields a simple regularization prescription: Take a\nsmall circular contour with the center of the circle at some vortex line point and the\nplane of the circle perpendicular to the vortex line (at the point of intersection), and\naverage the velocity field around the contour-to eliminate rotational component\nof the contour motion.\nAs is clear from (4), the singularity of the velocity field at some point s = s0 in\nthe vortex line comes from the integration over the close vicinity of the point s0 .\nTo isolate the singularity, we expand the function s(\u03be ) around the point s0 = s(\u03be0 ):\ns = s0 + s\u2032\u03be \u03be + s\u2032\u2032\u03be \u03be \u03be 2 /2 + . . . .\n\n(5)\n\n\f7\n\nHere \u03be is the parameter of the line. It is convenient to use the natural parameterization, that is to choose \u03be to be the (algebraic) arc length measured from the point\ns0 . Substituting this expansion into (4), we get\nv(r \u2192 s0 ) =\n\n\u03ba \u2032\ns \u00d7 s\u2032\u2032\u03be \u03be\n8\u03c0 \u03be\n\nZ \u03be\u2217\nd\u03be\n\u2212 \u03be\u2217\n\n|\u03be |\n\n+ regular part,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03be\u2217 is some upper cutoff parameter on the order of the curvature radius at the\npoint s0 . The integral in the right-hand side is divergent at \u03be \u2192 0. To regularize\nit we note (i) that, by its very origin, the expression (4) is meaningful only at\n|\u03be | > a0 , and (ii) the part of the vortex line with |\u03be | \u226a a0 does not give a significant\ncontribution to the net velocity on the contour of the radius \u223c a0 . Hence, with a\nlogarithmic accuracy we can adopt the regularization |\u03be | > a0 , that is\nZ \u03be\u2217\nd\u03be\n\u2212 \u03be\u2217\n\n\u2192 2 ln(\u03be\u2217 /a0 ) .\n\n|\u03be |\n\n(7)\n\nMoreover, by fine-tuning the value of a0 in accordance with a model-specific behavior at the distances \u223c a0 , the logarithmic accuracy of the regularization (7) can\nbe improved to the accuracy \u223c a0 /\u03be\u2217 . We discuss this option in detail in Sec. 2.4,\nand utilize in Sec. 3.\nWe thus arrive at the Biot-Savart equation of vortex line motion\n\n\u03ba\n\u1e61 =\n4\u03c0\n\nds0 \u00d7 (s \u2212 s0 )\n,\n|s \u2212 s0 |3\n\nZ\n\n(8)\n\nwith the integral regularized in accordance with (7).\nEquation (8) has two constants of motion:\nE =\n\nZ\n\nP=\n\nZ\n\nds * ds0\n,\n|s \u2212 s0 |\n\n(9)\n\ns \u00d7 ds ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich (up to dimensional factors) are nothing than the energy and momentum,\nrespectively.\n2.2 Local induction approximation (LIA)\nIn the absence of significant enhancement of non-local interactions by polarization\nof the vortex tangle, the regular part in (6) is smaller than the first term containing\nlarge logarithm. In such cases it is often-but not always (!), see the theory of\nthe pure Kelvin-wave cascade-safe to neglect the second term in (6) and proceed\nwithin LIA:\n\u1e61 = \u03b2 s\u03be\u2032 \u00d7 s\u2032\u2032\u03be \u03be ,\n(11)\nwhere\n\n\u03b2=\n\n\u03ba\nln(R/a0 ),\n4\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\n\f8\n\nwith the typical curvature radius R treated as a constant. Recalling that the parameter \u03be in (6) is the arc length, it is crucial that equation of motion (11) is consistent\nwith this requirement. [Speaking generally, in the course of evolution \u03be might deviate from the arc length.] The consistency is established by directly checking that\n(11) implies\nd \u221a\nds * ds = 0.\n(13)\ndt\nFrom Eq. (13) it trivially follows-by integrating over \u03be -that the total line length\nis conserved. The total line length in LIA plays the same role as the energy (9)\nin the genuine Biot-Savart equation. Indeed, from (9) it is seen that within the\nlogarithmic accuracy E is proportional to \u03b2 times line length. It is not difficult to\nalso make sure that Eq. (11) conserves P (10).\nThe standard constants of motion-the energy (line length), momentum, and\nangular momentum-are not the only quantities conserved by Eq. (11). For example, the integral of the square of the curvature radius is also conserved [37]:\nd\n(s\u2032\u2032\u03be \u03be )2 d \u03be = 0.\n(14)\ndt\nIn the next section we will see that the constant of motion (14) is just one of the\ninfinite set of constants of motion implied by the integrability of LIA.\nZ\n\n2.3 Hasimoto representation. Integrability of LIA\nBetchov [37] revealed certain interesting properties of LIA, e.g., Eq. (14), by rewriting Eq. (11) in terms of intrinsic variables of the vortex line: curvature, \u03b6 , and\ntorsion, \u03c4 . Hasimoto [38] further advanced these ideas by discovering that for the\ncomplex variable \u03c8 (\u03be ,t), such that\n\n\u03b6 = |\u03c8 |,\n\n\u03c4=\n\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202\u03be\n\n(15)\n\n(\u03a6 is the phase of \u03c8 ) the LIA equation (11) is equivalent to the non-linear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (time is measured in units \u03b2 \u22121 )\ni\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202 2\u03c8 1\n= \u2212 2 \u2212 |\u03c8 |2 \u03c8 .\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03be\n2\n\n(16)\n\nThe one-dimensional non-linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is known to be an integrable system featuring and infinite number of additive constants of motion, the\nexplicit form of which is given by [39]\nIn =\n\nZ \u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c6n (\u03be )d \u03be ,\n\n1\n\u03c61 = |\u03c8 |2 ,\n4\nd\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c8 (\u03c6n /\u03c8 ) + \u2211 \u03c6n1 \u03c6n2 .\nd\u03be\nn1 +n2 =n\n\n(17)\n\nThe integrability of LIA renders any non-trivial relaxation kinetics impossible,\nunless the reconnections are involved to break the conservation of In 's.\n\n\f9\n\n2.4 Hamiltonian formalism\nSuppose a vortex line can be parametrized by its Cartesian coordinates x and y\nas single-valued functions of the third coordinate z. In this case, the Biot-Savart\nlaw can be cast into a Hamiltonian form, very convenient for our purposes. First,\nintroduce a vector \u03c1 (z,t) = (x(z,t), y(z,t)). In contrast to the earlier-defined vector\ns(\u03be ,t) that follows the motion of the element of fluid containing the element of\nvortex line, the vector \u03c1 (z0 ,t) just defines the geometrical point of intersection of\nthe vortex line with the plane z = z0 . With this distinction in mind, it is easy to\nrelate the time derivatives of the two vectors:\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u1e91 +\n.\n(18)\n=\n\u2212 \u1e91 *\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\nHere \u1e91 is the unit vector in the z-direction. Substituting for \u2202 s/\u2202 t the right-hand\nside of Eq. (8), expressing then s in terms of \u03c1 , and finally replacing \u03c1 with a\ncomplex variable w(z,t) = x(z,t) + iy(z,t), we arrive at the Hamiltonian equation\nof vortex line motion:\n\u03b4H\n,\n(19)\ni\u1e87 =\n\u03b4 w\u2217\nH = (\u03ba /4\u03c0 )\n\nZ\n\n[1 + Re w\u2032\u2217 (z1 )w\u2032 (z2 )] dz1 dz2\np\n.\n(z1 \u2212 z2 )2 + |w(z1 ) \u2212 w(z2 )|2\n\n(20)\n\nThe Hamiltonian (20) is singular at z1 \u2192 z2 and thus needs to be regularized. To\nthis end we introduce r\u2217 such that\nand write\n\na0 \u226a r\u2217 \u226a \u03bb ,\n\n(21)\n\nH = Hloc + Hn.l. + O(r\u2217 /\u03bb ),\n\n(22)\n\nHn.l. = (\u03ba /4\u03c0 )\n\nZ\n\n|z1 \u2212z2 |>r\u2217\n\nHloc = 2\u03b2\n\n[1 + Re w\u2032\u2217 (z1 )w\u2032 (z2 )] dz1 dz2\np\n,\n(z1 \u2212 z2 )2 + |w(z1 ) \u2212 w(z2 )|2\nZ\n\ndz\n\nq\n\n1 + |w\u2032 (z)|2 ,\n\n\u03b2 = (\u03ba /2\u03c0 ) ln(r\u2217 /a\u2217 ).\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nHere the value of a\u2217 \u223c a0 is specially tuned to eliminate a factor of order unity in\nthe logarithm.-The absence of such a factor in Eq. (25) should not be confused\nwith a lack of control on first sub-logarithmic corrections. In view of the first inequality in (21), the Hamiltonian Hn.l. is of purely hydrodynamic nature, while the\nHamiltonian Hloc takes care of both hydrodynamic and microscopic (and system\nspecific) features at distances smaller that r\u2217 . In view of the condition \u03bb \u226b a0 , implied by Eq. (21), the microscopic specifics of the system is completely absorbed\nby the proper value of a\u2217 . Indeed, whatever is the physics at the distances of the\norder of the vortex core radius, the leading contribution from these distances to the\nenergy of a smooth vortex line should be directly proportional to the line length;\nand this is precisely what is expressed by Eq. (24).\n\n\f10\n\nThe freedom of choosing a particular value of r\u2217 within the range (21) can be\nused to introduce the local induction approximation by requiring that\nln(r\u2217 /a0 ) \u226b ln(\u03bb /r\u2217 ).\n\n(26)\n\nIn this case, the Hamiltonian (22), with\n\n\u03b2 = (\u03ba /2\u03c0 ) ln(\u03bb /a0 ) = \u039b \u03ba /2\u03c0 ,\n\n(27)\n\ncaptures the leading-as long as the interline interactions are not relevant-logarithmic\ncontribution, compared to which the non-local Hamiltonian (23) can be omitted\nwith logarithmic accuracy guaranteed by the parameter \u039b \u22121 \u226a 1.\nLess obvious technical trick is to formally set\nr\u2217 = a\u2217\n\n(28)\n\nto nullify the Hamiltonian Hloc . Doing so might seem to violate the range of applicability of the essentially hydrodynamic Hamiltonian Hn.l. [40]. Nevertheless, it is\nreadily seen by inspection that under the condition \u03bb \u226b a0 the resulting theory is\nequivalent to the theory (22)-(25) up to negligibly small corrections of the order\na0 /\u03bb . The resulting Hamiltonian is\nZ\n\nHpsd = (\u03ba /4\u03c0 )\n\n|z1 \u2212z2 |>a\u2217\n\n[1 + Re w\u2032\u2217 (z1 )w\u2032 (z2 )] dz1 dz2\np\n.\n(z1 \u2212 z2 )2 + |w(z1 ) \u2212 w(z2 )|2\n\n(29)\n\nIn direct analogy with the pseudo-potential method in the scattering theory, it has\na status of a pseudo-Hamiltonian in the sense that, being a convenient but rather\ninadequate model at the scales \u223c a0 , it accurately accounts for the long-wave\nmotion of the vortex lines (including all sub-leading corrections to LIA coming\nfrom the distances \u223c a0 ) by an appropriate choice of a\u2217 . In the next subsection, we\ndescribe an explicit procedure of extracting the value of a\u2217 from a model-specific\ndispersion relation of Kelvin waves.\n\n2.5 Kelvons. Angular momentum and the number of kelvons\nSuppose the amplitude of Kelvin waves (KW) is small enough, so that the following condition is satisfied:\n\n\u03b1 (z1 , z2 ) =\n\n|w(z1 ) \u2212 w(z2 )|\n\u226a 1.\n|z1 \u2212 z2 |\n\n(30)\n\nLinearizing (29) up to the leading orders in the dimensionless function \u03b1 (z1 , z2 ),\nwe obtain\nH0 = (\u03ba /8\u03c0 )\n\nZ\n\n|z1 \u2212z2 |>a\u2217\n\n\u0003\ndz1 dz2 \u0002\n2Re w\u2032\u2217 (z1 )w\u2032 (z2 ) \u2212 \u03b1 2 .\n|z1 \u2212 z2 |\n\n(31)\n\n\f11\n\nThe Hamiltonian H0 describes the linear properties of KW. It is diagonalized by\nthe Fourier transformation w(z) = L\u22121/2 \u2211k wk eikz (L is the system size, periodic\nboundary conditions are assumed):\nH0 = (\u03ba /4\u03c0 ) \u2211 \u03c9k w\u2217k wk ,\n\n(32)\n\nk\n\nyielding Kelvin's dispersion law\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001 2\n\u03ba\n1\n2\n+C0 + O (ka\u2217 )\nk ,\n\u03c9k =\nln\n4\u03c0\nka\u2217\n\n(33)\n\nwith\n\nC0 = 2\n2\n\nZ 1\ndx \u0002\n0\n\nx\n\nZ \u221e\ndx \u0002\n1\n\nx\n\n\u0003\ncos x + (cosx \u2212 1)/x2 +\n\n\u0003\ncos x \u2212 1/2 + (cosx \u2212 1)/x2 \u2248 \u22122.077.\n\n(34)\n\n\u0001\nGenerally speaking, the term O (ka\u2217 )2 should be omitted, since it goes beyond\nthe universality range of the pseudo-Hamiltonian (29).-In each particular microscopic model this term will be sensitive to the details of the physics at the length\nscale \u223c a0 . [With logarithmic accuracy, the constant C0 can be omitted as well,\nwhile the specific value of a\u2217 can be replaced with just and order-of-magnitude\nestimate a0 .]\nThe practical utility of Eq. (33) with sub-logarithmic correction C0 (34) for a\ngiven specific microscopic model-different from the pseudo-Hamiltonian (29)-\nis as follows. Eqs. (33)-(34) can be used to calibrate the value of a\u2217 , and thus fix\nthe pseudo-Hamiltonian, by separately solving for the KW spectrum in the given\nmicroscopic model and then casting the answer in the form (33)-(34). Likewise,\nfor a realistic strongly-correlated system like 4 He the appropriate value of a\u2217 in the\npseudo-Hamiltonian (29) can be calibrated by an experimentally measured kelvon\ndispersion.\nAlthough the problem of KW cascade generated by decaying superfluid turbulence is purely classical, it will be convenient to approach it quantum mechanically-\nby introducing KW quanta, kelvons. In accordance with the canonical quantization procedure, we understand wk as the annihilation operator of the kelvon with\nmomentum k and correspondingly treat w(z) as a quantum field. The Hamiltonian\nfunctional (29) is proportional to the energy-with the coefficient \u03ba\u03c1 /2, where\n\u03c1 is the mass density-but not equal to it. This means that if one prefers to work\nwith genuine Quantum Mechanics rather than a fake one (for our purposes, the\nlatter is also sufficient), using true kelvon annihilation operators, \u00e2k , field operator\n\u0175, and Hamiltonian, \u0124, he should\ntake into account proper dimensional coeffip\ncients: \u0124 = (\u03ba\u03c1 /2)H, \u0175k = 2h\u0304/\u03ba\u03c1 \u00e2k . By choosing the units h\u0304 = \u03ba = 1, \u03c1 = 2,\nwe ignore these coefficients until the final answers are obtained.\nIn the quantum approach, there naturally arises the notion of the number of\nkelvons. This number is conserved in view of its global U(1) symmetry of the\nHamiltonian, w \u2192 ei\u03c6 w reflecting the rotational symmetry of the problem. The\nrotational symmetry is also responsible for the conservation of the angular momentum component along the vortex line direction. Thus the number of kelvons is\n\n\f12\n\nimmediately related to the angular momentum component [41]: one kelvon carries\na single (negative) quantum, \u2212h\u0304, of the angular momentum component along the\nvortex line relative to the macroscopic angular momentum of the rectilinear vortex\nline.\nAnother advantage of the quantum language in weak-turbulence problems,\nwhich we intensively employ in this paper, is that the collision term of the kinetic equation immediately follows from the Golden Rule for the corresponding\nelementary processes.\n\n3 Pure Kelvin-wave cascade\n3.1 Qualitative analysis\nIn the problem of low-temperature ST decay at the length scales smaller than\nthe typical interline separation, the pure Kelvin-wave cascade on individual vortex lines is perhaps the most natural decay scenario one can think of. Indeed,\nthe non-linear nature of Kelvin-wave dynamics should allow such a process in\nwhich the energy in the form of Kelvin waves is transferred from the long-wave\nenergy-containing modes to the short wavelengths where the dissipation becomes\nefficient. Provided with a wide inertial range, one could also expect such a transfer of energy to be local in the wavenumber space, in which case the relaxation is\nlikely to be due to a cascade.\nA subtlety that is immediately clear is the complete absence of kinetics in\nthe leading approximation, which stems from the aforementioned integrability of\nthe LIA, Eq. (11). If it exists, the pure Kelvin-wave cascade must be entirely due\nto the non-local coupling between different vortex-line elements. Hence, being\nsuppressed by the small parameter \u039b \u22121 \u226a 1 relative to the leading LIA dynamics, the pure KW cascade is an a priori weak phenomenon. This fact provides\nus with an important consistency check of the results: the leading contribution\n\u221d \u039b -determined by the effective microscopic cutoff parameter a\u2217 , if one uses\nthe pseudo-Hamiltonian (29)-must completely drop out of the effective kelvon\nscattering amplitude.\nThe success of the Kolmogorov-type argumentation makes it very tempting to\nuse a dimensional analysis of the dynamical equations of motion to immediately\nextract, e.g., energy spectra. Such a simple approach for Kelvin-wave turbulence,\nhowever, is doomed to failure. The reason is that here the scale invariance dictates\nthe kinetics to be controlled by a purely geometrical dimensionless parameter \u03b1k =\nbk k, where bk is the typical KW amplitude at the wavenumber k. Thus, the solution\ncould be only obtained from the corresponding kinetic equation, which reveals the\nproper combination of \u03b1k and k the kinetics are due to. Deriving and solving the\nkinetic equation will be our main goal in the this section.\nLet us first determine the general structure of the collisional term. The key\naspects that essentially fix this structure are (i) the conservation of the number\nof kelvons, discussed in Sec. 2, (ii) the dimensionality of the problem, and (iii)\nweakness of non-linearities. The first circumstance means that the kinetics are\nentirely due to kelvon elastic scattering since the elementary events of kelvon creation/annihilation are prohibited. In other words, the only allowed kinetic channel\n\n\f13\n\nis energy-momentum exchange between kelvons. On the other hand, the energymomentum conservation laws in one dimension make this exchange impossible\nin two-kelvon collisions: the process (k1 , k2 ) \u2192 (k3 , k4 ) is only allowed if either\n(k3 = k1 , k4 = k2 ), or (k3 = k2 , k4 = k1 ) which does not lead to any kinetics. Thus\nany non-trivial kinetics can be only due to collisions of three or more kelvons.\nThe third condition translates into the fact that the amplitudes of Kelvin waves\nbk in the pure cascade are necessarily small compared to their wavelengths, \u03b1k =\nbk k \u226a 1, at least at sufficiently large k. This is the central feature of this regime,\nwhich is due to the following. The cascade solution with the largest possible amplitudes, \u03b1k \u2248 1, corresponds to the regime driven by self-reconnections, as described in Sec. 4, the regime where the non-linear effects are negligible altogether.\nThe weakness of the purely non-linear kinetics makes the amplitude at a scale k\nrise (due to the energy supplied from the larger length scales) until bk is of order\n1/k and the self-reconnection can happen causing the energy transfer to a smaller\nscale. If non-linear processes are appreciable, smaller amplitudes bk are sufficient\nto sustain the energy flux. Thus, the pure cascade spectrum, which due to the scale\ninvariance has a general power-law form \u03b1k = bk k \u221d k\u03b2 , must be constrained by\n\u03b2 \u2264 0. Apart from the marginal \u03b2 = 0, the latter requirement guarantees that a theory built on \u03b1k \u226a 1 becomes asymptotically exact at hight wavenumbers. Correspondingly, self-reconnections, being exponentially dependant on \u03b1k , necessarily\ncease in the purely non-linear cascade.\nThe smallness of the Kelvin-wave amplitudes in the particle language means\nthat the many-kelvon collisions are rare events and we can confine ourselves to\nthe leading three-kelvon processes in the kinetic term.\nThese simple considerations already substantially limit the freedom in writing\nthe collision term. In fact, the only missing ingredient, which needs to be calculated, is the wavenumber dependence of the effective kelvon scattering vertex.\nPostponing the final issue of finding this dependence until the next section, let\nus analyze the kinetic equation in a general form.

We are of course interested in the classical-field limit of the Eq.

In the following subsection, we\nmake sure that both conditions are satisfied: the condition (i) can be checked by\na dimensional estimate, provided (ii) is true. The condition (ii) is verified numerically. Under these conditions one can establish the cascade spectrum by a simple\ndimensional analysis of the kinetic equation.\nThe locality of the collision term implies that the integral in (38) builds up\naround (k2 , . . . , k6 ) \u223c k1 , which dramatically simplifies the kinetic equation:\n\u1e45k \u221d k5 * |\u1e7c |2 * \u03c9k\u22121 * k\u22121 * n5k ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere the factors go in the order of the appearance of corresponding terms in (38).\nAt k1 \u223c . . . \u223c k6 \u223c k we have |V | \u221d k\u03bd and\n\u1e45k \u221d \u03c9k\u22121 n5k k4+2\u03bd .\n\n(40)\n\nThe energy flux (per unit vortex line length), \u03b8k , at the momentum scale k is defined as\n(41)\n\u03b8k = L\u22121 \u2211 \u03c9k\u2032 \u1e45k\u2032 ,\nk\u2032 <k\n\nimplying the estimate \u03b8k \u223c k\u1e45k \u03c9k . Combined with (40), this yields \u03b8k \u223c n5k k5+2\u03bd ,\nand the cascade requirement that \u03b8k be actually k-independent leads to the spectrum\n(42)\nnk \u221d h\u0175\u2020k \u0175k i = A k\u2212(5+2\u03bd )/5 .\n\nThe value of the spectrum amplitude A in (42) controls the energy flux that the\ncascade transports. The relation between \u03b8 and A is\n\n\u03b8 = C\u03b8 \u03ba 3 \u03c1 A5 .\n\n(43)\n\nThe dimensionless coefficient C\u03b8 in this formula can be obtained, e.g., by a straightforward numerical calculation, as it was done by the authors in Ref. [13]. However,\nthe calculation of Ref. [13] in view of a large relative error allowed to obtain only\nthe order of magnitude of C\u03b8 , which, as we explain in the next subsection, can\nbe further questioned due to an erroneous omission of an order-one term in the\neffective vertex.\n\n\f15\n\n3.2 Quantitative analysis\n4,5,6\nThe central problem of this section is the derivation of the effective vertex V1,2,3\n,\nwhich defines the effective kelvon interaction Hamiltonian (36) (\u1e7c is obtained\nfrom V by symmetrization with respect to corresponding momenta permutations).\nWe start with the pseudo-Hamiltonian (29). Our fundamental requirement that the\namplitude of KW turbulence is small as compared to the wavelength, \u03b1k \u226a 1, is\nformulated by Eq. (30). This allows us to expand (29) in powers of \u03b1 (z1 , z2 ) \u226a\n1: H = E0 + H0 + H1 + H2 + . . . (E0 is just a number and will be ignored). The\nterm H0 is given by Eq. (31). As we demonstrated in the previous subsection, it\ndescribes the linear properties of the Kelvin waves, in particular it determines the\nKelvin-wave dispersion law, Eq. (33). The higher-order terms are responsible for\ninteractions between kelvons. The terms that will prove relevant are\n\n\u03ba\nH1 =\n32\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndz1 dz2\n[3\u03b1 4 \u2212 4\u03b1 2 Re w\u2032\u2217 (z1 )w\u2032 (z2 )] ,\n|z1 \u2212 z2 |\n\n(44)\n\n\u03ba\n64\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndz1 dz2\n[6\u03b1 4 Re w\u2032\u2217 (z1 )w\u2032 (z2 ) \u2212 5\u03b1 6 ] .\n|z1 \u2212 z2 |\n\n(45)\n\n|z1 \u2212z2 |>a\u2217\n\nand\nH2 =\n\n|z1 \u2212z2 |>a\u2217\n\nAs already demonstrated, the leading elementary process in our case is the\nthree-kelvon scattering and the processes involving four and more kelvons are\n4,5,6\nmuch weaker due to the inequality (30). The effective vertex, V1,2,3\n, for the threekelvon scattering [subscripts (superscripts) stand for the initial (final) momenta]\nconsists of two different parts. The first part is due to the terms generated by the\ntwo-kelvon vertex, A (corresponding to the Hamiltonian H1 ) in the second order\nof perturbation theory. [All these terms are similar to each other; we explicitly\n5,6\n4,7\n. Here G(\u03c9 , k) = 1/(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k ) is the\nspecify just one of them: A1,2\nG(\u03c97 , k7 ) A7,3\nfree-kelvon propagator, \u03c97 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c94 , k7 = k1 + k2 \u2212 k4 .] The second part\nof the vertex V is the bare three-kelvon vertex, B, associated with the Hamiltonian\nH2 .

For this purpose, as well as for the convenience of the numerical analysis described below, we process the integrals (46), (47) as follows. We introduce\na characteristic wavelength \u03bb \u2261 \u03bb (k1 , k2 , k3 , k4 , k5 , k6 ), the particular functional\nform being not important. Then, from each of the integrals (46), (47), we subtract the corresponding LIA contributions, which are easily obtained by the same\nprocedure that led to Eqs. (46), (47) from the local Hamiltonian (24) defined by\n\n\u03b2\u03bb = (\u03ba /2\u03c0 )\u039b\u03bb ,\n\n\u039b\u03bb = ln(\u03bb /a\u2217 ).\n\n(48)\n\n\f17\n\nAs a result of the subtraction, up to system-specific terms \u223c (a\u2217 /\u03bb )2 to be neglected below, we get a\u2217 -independent convergent integrals. Thereby we arrive at a\nconvenient decomposition: A = \u039b\u03bb A(0) + A(1) , B = \u039b\u03bb B(0) + B(1) , where A(0) and\nB(0) are known analytically from LIA, while A(1) and B(1) are easily calculated\nnumerically (see below for some useful details). On the technical side, the decomposition solves the problem of handling the logarithmic divergency, whereas\nphysically, it clarifies the form of the dependence on the vortex-core details, which\nturn out to be entirely enclosed by LIA.\nTo proceed with estimating possible systematic errors, we introduce the expansion of the propagator G in the powers of inverse \u039b\u03bb :\nG = \u039b\u03bb\u22121 [G(0) + \u039b\u03bb\u22121 G(1) + \u039b\u03bb\u22122 G(2) + O(\u039b\u03bb\u22123 )].\n\n(49)\n\nFor the vertex V = AGA + B (see Fig. 2), we thus have\nV = \u039b\u03bb V (0) +V (1) +V (2) /\u039b\u03bb + O(\u039b\u03bb\u22122 ),\n\n(50)\n\nwith\nV (0) = A(0) G(0) A(0) + B(0) ,\nV (1) = 2A(0) G(0) A(1) + A(0) G(1) A(0) + B(1) ,\nV (2) = A(0) G(2) A(0) + 2A(0) G(1) A(1) + A(1) G(0) A(1) .\nNote that by construction all the quantities A(i) , B(i) , G(i) , and V (i) are a\u2217 -independent,\nsince the dependence on a\u2217 -up to the neglected terms \u223c (a\u2217 /\u03bb )2 -comes exclusively through \u039b\u03bb . The term \u039b\u03bb V (0) is precisely the effective vertex that follows\nfrom the LIA Hamiltonian (24), and thus it necessarily obeys V (0) \u2261 0. The leading contribution to V is the a\u2217 -independent V (1) . Thus, the short-range physics\nenters the answer only as a small in 1/\u039b\u03bb correction.\nNow we are in a position to specify the systematic error due to uncertainties\nin microscopic details. In the case when it is possible to calibrate the pseudoHamiltonian, that is to find (analytically or experimentally, see Sec. 2) the accurate\nvalue of a\u2217 , the systematic error is of order (a\u2217 /\u03bb )2 . Otherwise, we are forced to\nset a\u2217 \u223c a0 , meaning that the parameter \u039b\u03bb \u226b 1 is only known up to \u03b4\u039b\u03bb \u223c 1,\nwhich for the systematic uncertainty in V gives V (2) \u03b4\u039b\u03bb /\u039b\u03bb2 \u223c 1/\u039b\u03bb2 . We thus\narrive at an important conclusion that even if the microscopic details, such as the\nvortex-core shape, are completely unknown, by naively setting \u039b\u03bb = ln(\u03bb /a0 ) we\nare paying by a relative error of only 1/\u039b\u03bb2 .\nA comment is in order here on the technical issue of a convenient handling\nof the integrals, which we do numerically, upon subtracting the logarithmic singularity. The whole procedure is almost identical to the one that led us to the\nkelvon dispersion, Eqs. (33)-(34). The new aspect is the dependence on four/six\nmomenta, rendering a direct tabulation of integrals computationally expensive.\nThe trick is to split a four/six-parametric integral into a sum of single-parametric\nintegrals. A minor technical problem comes from the power-law divergence at\nx \u2192 0 of each separate single-parametric integral in Eqs. (46), (47). The problem\nis readily solved by introducing power-law counter-terms-the net contribution\nof which is identically equal to zero-rendering each individual single-parametric\n\n\f18\n\nintegral convergent. As an illustration, we present the final result for the regularized (by subtracting the LIA terms and introducing the counter-terms) integral D\nof Eq. (46), which we denote with D\u0303. With the re-scaled (by x \u2192 \u03bb x) integration\nvariable, the expression reads\nZ \u221e\n\u0010\n\u0002 \u0003 \u0002 \u0003 \u00023 \u0003 \u00024 \u0003 \u00023 \u0003 \u000243 \u0003 \u00024 \u0003\u0011\n3,4\nD\u03031,2\n= \u03bb \u22124\n(dx/x5 ) 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 2 \u2212\n\u2212\n+ 2 +\n+ 2\n1\n\n+\u03bb\n\n\u22124\n\nZ 1\n0\n\n(dx/x5 )\n\n\u0010 \u0002\u0002 \u0003\u0003\n3\n2\n\n+\n\n\u0002\u000243 \u0003\u0003\n\n+\n\n\u0002\u00024 \u0003\u0003\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0002\u0002 \u0003\u0003\n1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0002\u0002 \u0003\u0003\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0002\u00023 \u0003\u0003\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0002\u00024 \u0003\u0003\u0011\n.

The symbol *** means that for the cosine, we\nsubtract first few-first three in the case of D\u0303-terms of its Taylor expansion to\nrender corresponding single-parametric integral convergent (and thus individually\ntabulatable).\nFrom Eqs. (46), (47) it is straightforward to obtain the scaling of the effective\nvertex V with the momenta-at k1 \u223c . . . \u223c k6 \u223c k we have |V | \u223c k6 . Thus, \u03bd = 6 in\nEq. (42) and the pure Kelvin-wave cascade spectrum (restoring all the dimensional\ncoefficients) is\n2h\u0304 nk\n= A k\u221217/5 .\n(52)\nh\u0175\u2020k \u0175k i =\n\u03ba\u03c1\nThis result was corroborated in a direct numerical simulation by the authors\n[14], where the spectrum (52) was resolved with a high accuracy allowing us to\ndistinguish it from n \u221d k\u22123 suggested in an earlier simulation by Vinen et al.\n[12]. The high precision required to distinguish the close exponents, both in terms\nof the cascade inertial range extent and low noise, was achieved using a special\nnumerical scheme developed to reduce the complexity of the non-local model (29)\nto that of an effectively local one at an expense of a controllable systematic error.\nWe refer to Ref. [13] for more details.\nLet us also express the spectrum in terms of the typical geometrical amplitude,\nbk , of the KW turbulence at the wavevector \u223c k. By the definition of the field \u0175(z)\nwe have: b2k \u223c L\u22121 \u2211q\u223ck h\u0175\u2020k \u0175k i \u223c k h\u0175\u2020k \u0175k i. Hence, using Eq. (43), we obtain\nbk \u223c (\u0398 /\u03ba 3 \u03c1 )1/10 k\u22126/5 .\n\n(53)\n\nOne can convert (52) into the curvature spectrum. For the curvature c(\u03b6 ) = \u2202 2 s/\u2202 \u03b6 2\n[where s(\u03b6 ) is the radius-vector of the curve as a function of the arc\n\u03b6 ], the\nR length\n2 d \u03b6 . The\n\u03b6\n)|\nspectrum is defined as Fourier decomposition of the\nintegral\nI\n=\n|c(\nc\nR\nsmallness of \u03b1 , Eq. (30), allows one to write Ic \u2248 dzh\u0175\u2032\u2032\u2020 (z)\u0175\u2032\u2032 (z)i = \u2211k k4 nk \u221d\n\u2211k k3/5 , arriving thus at the exponent 3/5.\nSo far we were heavily relying on the assumption of locality of the kinetic processes in the wavenumber space. We checked [13] the validity of this assumption\nby a numerical analysis of the kinetic equation thereby (i) making sure that the\ncollision term of the kinetic equation is local and (ii) estimating the value of the\ndimensionless coefficient in (43) (see, however, below). The analysis is based on\nthe following idea [42]. Consider a power-law distribution of occupation numbers,\nnk = A/k\u03b2 , with the exponent \u03b2 arbitrarily close, but not equal, to the cascade exponent \u03b20 = 17/5. Substitute this distribution in the collision term of the kinetic\n\n\f19\n\nequation-right-hand side of (38). Given the scale invariance of the power-law\ndistribution, the following alternative takes place. Case (1): collision integral converges for \u03b2 's close to \u03b20 , and, in accordance with a straightforward dimensional\nanalysis, is equal to\nColl([nk = A/k\u03b2 ], k) = C(\u03b2 )A5 \u03c9k\u22121 /k5\u03b2 \u221216 .\n\n(54)\n\nHere C(\u03b2 ) is a dimensionless function of \u03b2 , such that C(\u03b20 ) = 0 since the cascade\nis a steady-state solution. Case (2): collision integral diverges for \u03b2 close to \u03b20 .\nThe case (2) means that the collision term is non-local and the whole analysis\nin terms of the Kolmogorov-like cascade is irrelevant. Fortunately, our numerics\nshow that we are dealing with the case (1). Substituting (54) for \u1e45k in (41), we\nobtain the expression \u03b8k (\u03b2 ) = (A5 /2\u03c0 ) k17\u22125\u03b2 C(\u03b2 )/(17 \u2212 5\u03b2 ). Taking the limit\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b20 , we arrive at the k-independent flux \u03b8 = \u2212C\u2032 (\u03b20 )A5 /10\u03c0 .\nIn Ref. [13], we used this formula to obtain the coefficient in (43) by calculating C(\u03b2 ) and finding its derivative C\u2032 (\u03b20 ) = \u221210\u03c0 C\u03b8 . We simulated the collision\nintegral by Monte Carlo method. The integrals (46), (47), were calculated numerically. However, a mistake was made at the level of combining these integrals into\nthe effective vertex V . Due to the cancelation of the leading logarithmic terms\none has to keep an accurate account of the sub-logarithmic corrections, including those in the kelvon propagator G(\u03c9 , k) = 1/(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k ) as well, as we already\ndemonstrated above. Unfortunately, we failed to appreciate a simple fact that the\nconstant C0 appearing in the kelvon dispersion (33) results in an order-one contribution to the effective vertex V , and neglected this constant in the propagator.\nSince the coefficient C\u03b8 \u2248 10\u22125 was obtained in Ref. [13] only as an order of\nmagnitude estimate (with an error \u223c 75% due to a slowing down of the high-order\nnumerical integration) the mistake might not significantly effect this result, but\nstill makes it questionable. A more accurate determination of C\u03b8 is necessary.\n\n4 Self-reconnection driven cascade\n4.1 Absence of Feynman's cascade\nFor quite a long period of time it has been generally accepted that at T = 0 the\nscenario of decay of superfluid turbulence is the one proposed by Feynman [36].\nNamely, that vortex lines first decay into vortex rings, each of the rings then independently self-reconnects, producing smaller rings, each of the smaller rings selfreconnects to produce even smaller rings, and so forth. In this respect it is very\ncharacteristic that even after the absence of pure Feynman's cascade was directly\nshown, and the scenario of Kelvin-wave cascade driven by local self-crossings was\nproposed [5], simulations of the low-temperature decay within LIA performed in\nRef. [9] were still interpreted in terms of Feynman's cascade.\nThe problem with Feynman's cascade is that it is inconsistent with simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum [5]. This is clear from the mere fact\nthat energy scales as the length of the ring (up to logarithmic corrections) while the\nmomentum scales as the length squared, so that a decay into arbitrarily small rings\nwith the net line length conserved would result in vanishing total momentum.\n\n\f20\n\n4.2 Generation of Kelvin waves in the process of line reconnection\nWith a slight modification of the time dependence of the phase, the standard\nself-similar solution of the linear Schr\u00f6dinger's equation-its Green's function-\napplies also to the non-linear equation (16). Indeed, the absolute value of the solution is spatially homogeneous, so that the non-linearity is equivalent to a spatially\nhomogeneous time dependent external potential that can be immediately absorbed\ninto the phase as an extra time-dependent term. The result is\n\u0014\u0012 2\n\u0013\u0015\nA\n\u03be\nA2\n\u221a\n\u03c8 (\u03be ,t) =\nexp i\n+\nln |t| .\n(55)\n4t\n2\nt\nIn accordance with (15), this solution implies\n\u221a\n\u03be = A/ t,\n\n(56)\n\n\u03c4 = \u03be /2t.\n\n(57)\n\nThe physical meaning of the solution (56)-(57), first revealed by Buttke [43], is\nthe relaxation of the vortex angle, the value of which is controlled by the parameter A. This solution gives an accurate description (within LIA) of relaxation of\ntwo vortex lines after their reconnection, as long as the curvature in the relaxation region remains much larger than the curvatures of the two lines away from\nthe region, so that the distant parts of the two lines can be approximately treated\nas straight lines. By dimensional argument, the self-similarity regime should be\nachieved very rapidly upon the reconnection, with the velocity of propagation of\nthe fastest Kelvin waves (with wave vectors \u223c a0 ).\nWith the solution (56)-(57) one can explicitly see that reconnections lift the\nintegrability constraints. At \u03be \u2192 \u221e we have \u03c6n \u223c \u03be n , meaning that a single reconnection renders all the integrals In (18) divergent.\nLet us look at the asymptotic form of the solution (56)-(57) in Cartesian coordinates, taking the direction of the z-axis along one of the two lines, z \u2192 +\u221e\ncorresponding to the asymptotic limit:\n\u221a\n2\n(58)\nx(z,t) + iy(z,t) = (4At 3/2 /z2 )eiz /4t , z \u226b t.\nEquation (58) reveals a helical Kelvin-wave structure moving away from the reconnection region. It is important that while arbitrarily small wavelengths are\npresent in the solution (58),\u221athe integral for the total line lengths comes from\nthe largest length scale z \u223c t. This provides a support for two crucial points of\nthe scenario of self-reconnectionsdriven Kelvin-wave cascade: (i) Reconnections\npush Kelvin waves to smaller lengthscales, (ii) apart from higher-order corrections, the line length associated with the curvature radius R cannot go directly to\nthe scales of curvature radius much smaller than R (locality of the cascade in the\nwavenumber space).\nWhen the angle between the two lines is close to \u03c0 , the reconnection leads to\na production of vortex rings [43]. This process does not introduce a new cascade\nchannel. Qualitatively it is very similar to the pure production of Kelvin waves\n(58), because, up to higher-order corrections, the line length is being transferred\nto the rings of the radii of the order of the curvature radii of reconnecting lines,\ni.e. to adjacent scales in the kelvon wavenumber space.\n\n\f21\n\n4.3 Fractalization of lines. Kelvin-wave spectrum\nIn this subsection we render the analysis of Ref. [5] of the fractalization of a vortex\nline by the self-crossings driven Kelvin-wave cascade. We start with introducing\nthe crucial notion of a smoothed line length, L (\u03bb1 ), which is the length of a\n(fractalized) line upon smoothing out all the structures of the length scales smaller\nthan \u03bb1 . Corresponding mathematical expression reads\nln L (\u03bb1 ) \u223c ln L (\u03bb0 ) +\n\nZ \u03bb0\n\u03bb1\n\n(b\u03bb /\u03bb )2 d \u03bb /\u03bb ,\n\n(59)\n\nwhere b\u03bb is the characteristic amplitude of the Kelvin-wave structure at the wavelength \u03bb , while \u03bb0 is, generally speaking, any fixed wavelength scale significantly\nlarger than \u03bb1 . In particular, if \u03bb0 is the largest wavelength of the problem, then\nL (\u03bb0 ) is the length of maximally smoothed vortex line. With L (\u03bb ) we can estimate the number of local self-crossings at the scale \u03bb per unit time as\nN\u03bb \u223c\n\nL (\u03bb )\n\u03a9 (\u03bb ) \u03c9\u03bb ,\n\u03bb\n\n(60)\n\nwhere the factor L (\u03bb )/\u03bb gives the number of statistically independent pieces of\nthe line (at the wavelength scale \u03bb typical correlation length is \u223c \u03bb ), the factor\n\u03a9 (\u03bb ) is the probability to have a large enough amplitude \u223c \u03bb to produce a selfcrossing within a given element of the line with the length \u223c \u03bb , and \u03c9\u03bb is the\nkelvon frequency playing the role of inverse correlation time.\nTo estimate \u03a9 (\u03bb ), we can rely on the theoretical limit of b\u03bb \u226a \u03bb , in which\nkelvons are independent harmonic modes and, correspondingly, the statistics of\nfluctuations of the amplitude is Gaussian. This readily yields\n\n\u03a9 (\u03bb ) \u223c (b\u03bb /\u03bb )e\u2212(\u03bb /b\u03bb ) .\n2\n\n(61)\n\nWe do not introduce any dimensionless factor in the Gaussian exponent in view of\nthe freedom of defining b\u03bb up to a factor of order unity.\nFor any cascade the fundamental notion is the flux of corresponding conserved\nquantity. In our case, it is the flux of the vortex line length. The fractalization of the\nlines introduces certain subtleties. In contrast to a standard cascade in which the\nintegral for the conserved quantity comes from a single length scale, in our case\nthe line length is spread over all scales of distance of the inertial range. Moreover,\ndifferent wavelength scales are not entirely independent in the sense that with the\nfractalized lines the short-range structures with their energy are slaved by the longwave structures. So that the line length coming from long waves to shorter ones\nis essentially carried by short-ranged structures slaved by the long-wave modes.\nThe crucial observation now is that with respect to larger wavelengths the slaved\nshorter wavelengths play a rather passive role in energy balance, since short-wave\ncontribution to line length carried by the longer waves is just proportional to the\nsmoothed line length. Correspondingly, one can speak of the smoothed line length\nflux, Q(\u03bb1 ), where \u03bb1 is the smoothing parameter of Eq. (59). By definition of the\ncascade, the quantity Q is one and the same for any wavelength scale \u03bb , as long\nas \u03bb \u226b \u03bb1 .\n\n\f22\n\nHaving fixed some wavelength scale \u03bb , we note that the self-reconnections\nscenario implies\nQ(\u03bb1 ) \u223c N\u03bb R\u03bb (\u03bb1 ),\n(62)\nwhere R\u03bb (\u03bb1 ) is the length of a \u03bb1 -smoothed circle of the radius \u223c \u03bb . In a direct\nanalogy with (59), we have\nln R\u03bb (\u03bb1 ) \u223c ln \u03bb +\n\nZ \u03bb\n\u03bb1\n\n(b\u03bb \u2032 /\u03bb \u2032 )2 d \u03bb \u2032 /\u03bb \u2032 .\n\n(63)\n\nFrom (63) and (59) the follows a useful relation\nL (\u03bb )R\u03bb (\u03bb1 ) \u223c \u03bb L (\u03bb1 ).\n\n(64)\n\nWith N\u03bb (60) , \u03a9 (\u03bb ) (61), the estimate \u03c9\u03bb \u223c \u03b2 /\u03bb 2 , and the relation (64), equation\n(62) yields\nQ(\u03bb1 )/L (\u03bb1 ) \u223c (\u03b2 b\u03bb /\u03bb 3 )e\u2212(\u03bb /b\u03bb ) .\n2\n\n(65)\n\nThe left-hand side of this relation is a function of \u03bb1 , while the right-hand side is\na function of \u03bb , meaning that both sides are actually constants. For the right-hand\nside this implies\n(b\u03bb0 /\u03bb0 )2\n(b\u03bb /\u03bb )2 \u223c\n.\n(66)\n1 + (b\u03bb0 /\u03bb0 )2 ln(\u03bb0 /\u03bb )\n(Since up to logarithmic corrections we have b\u03bb \u223c \u03bb , we do not distinguish between ln b\u03bb and ln \u03bb .) Expression (66) yields the Kelvin-wave cascade spectrum\nin terms of the characteristic amplitude b\u03bb . As far as the function L (\u03bb ) is concerned, from (66) and (59) we find\n\"\n#\u03bd\n\u0013\n\u0012\nb\u03bb0 2 \u03bb0\nln\nL (\u03bb ) = L (\u03bb0 ) 1 +\n,\n(67)\n\u03bb0\n\u03bb\nwhere \u03bd is a constant of order unity the particular value of which cannot be established by our order-of-magnitude analysis.\nIt is clear from Eq. (53) that no matter how large the energy flux (per unit\nvortex-line length) \u03b8 \u221d Q transported by the self-crossings regime is, at sufficiently high wavenumbers the pure Kelvin-wave cascade will be capable of supporting it. As soon as the purely non-linear kinetics become appreciable, the amplitudes of Kelvin waves must become smaller, which in view of Eq. (61), inhibits\nthe reconnections. Thus, the self-crossings-driven regime will inevitably be replaced by the pure Kelvin-wave cascade at some scale \u03bb\u2217 . Note, however, that\ndue to a small difference between the Kelvin-wave spectra in the two regimes,\nEqs. (53), (66), the crossover between them is likely to be extended in the wavenumber space. A rough estimate of the scale \u03bb\u2217 can be obtained by setting bk \u223c k\u22121 \u223c\n\u03bb\u2217 in Eq. (53). The result clearly depends on the cascade energy flux \u03b8 , which\nis specific to the physics at the energy-containing scale. In quasi-classical turbulence, \u03b8 is related to the Kolmogorov energy flux, in which case an estimate for \u03bb\u2217\nwill be obtained in Sec. 5. In the case of a non-structured tangle, the energy flux\n\n\f23\n\nis formed by reconnections at the scale of interline separation l0 , \u03b8ns \u223c \u03ba 3 \u03c1\u039b 2 /l02 ,\nwith \u039b = ln(l0 /a\u2217 ), which gives\n\n\u03bb\u2217 \u223c l0 / \u039b\n\n(non \u2212 structured tangles).\n\n(68)\n\nAccording to this rough estimate, the inertial range for the regime driven by local\nself-crossings is only about \u039b /10 decades, which for realistic values of \u039b could\nturn out to be an insignificant range without a distinct spectral signature. Thus, it\nwould be crucial to quantify the crossover between the regimes by a direct numeric\nsimulation.\n\n4.4 Qualitative Hamiltonian model\nThe Hamiltonian description (19) implies single-valuedness of the function w(z).\nAmazingly, the question of what happens to the mathematical solution of Eq. (19)\nwhen the physical function w(z) becomes non-single valued turns out to be very\nrelevant to the theory of self-crossings driven cascade. Clearly enough, the mathematical solution has to develop a certain singularity, and, strictly speaking, become ill defined afterwards. However, if one introduces a discretized analog of the\nproblem described by the Hamiltonian [5] (we confine ourselves to LIA),\ni\u1e87n =\n\n\u2202H\n,\n\u2202 w\u2217n\n\nH=\n\nN\u22121 q\n\n\u2211\n\nn=0\n\n1 + |wn+1 \u2212 wn |2 ,\n\n(69)\n\nthe Hamiltonian dynamics remains well-defined at any time moment. Numerical analysis of this model [5] shown that that the above-mentioned singularity\nevolves into a finite jump between the values of w j and w j+1 , at a certain j. The\njump exists for a certain time, and then relaxes, the relaxation process being qualitatively similar to the process of vortex angle evolution in the sense that Kelvin\nwaves are being emitted, while the integrability constraint is naturally lifted by\nnon-smothness of the function. With the precise geometric meaning of the Hamiltonian (69)-the length of the broken line defined by the points {wn }-we realize\nthat the dynamics governed by it should be qualitatively equivalent to the selfreconnection induced cascade, leading to the fractalization of the line necessary\nto support jumps of arbitrarily small amplitude, the amplitude of the jump playing\nqualitatively the same role as the radius of the ring in the self-crossings driven\ncascade. And that is precisely what has been revealed by numeric simulation of\nthe model (69) in Ref. [5]. The simulations also revealed the spectrum b\u03bb \u223c \u03bb ,\nconsistent with Eq. (66), the logarithmic factor going beyond numeric resolution.\n\n5 Crossover from Richardson-Kolmogorov to Kelvin-wave cascade\n5.1 Quasi-classical tangles at T=0: crossover to the quantized regime\nEven at absolute zero temperature the superfluid dynamics supports a turbulent\nregime, which under certain conditions is indistinguishable from classical turbulence [4]. That may seem quite surprising since the only degrees of freedom in\n\n\f24\n\na superfluid at T = 0 are quantized vortex lines, which are singular topological objects and thus are very different from the classical eddies responsible for\nturbulence in classical ideal incompressible fluids. Nonetheless, quantized vortex\nlines possess a mechanism that allows them to mimic classical vorticity-it is well\nknown [1] that macroscopic velocity profile of a rapidly rotated superfluid mimics solid-body rotation, which is accomplished by formation of a dense array of\nvortex lines aligned along the rotation axis. The basis of this mechanism is the\nstrong coupling between the vortex lines in the dense array, which makes such\na bundle behave as a single coherent classical object. Therefore, by essentially\nclassical turbulence generation methods (i.e. \"stirring\") one can produce vorticity\nin the course-grained up to length scales larger than the typical interline separation l0 superfluid velocity field, indistinguishable from that of a normal fluid, the\nunderlying vortex tangle being organized in polarized \"bundles\" of vortex lines.\nOver the last decade, experimental observations of the classical behavior exhibited by superfluids [29, 30, 31, 18, 16, 19, 24] have largely led to a renaissance\nof general interest in superfluid turbulence. Perhaps the most attractive feature of\nthis quasi-classical turbulence is that, unlike counterflow turbulence, it in principle\nallows generation and probing at temperatures close to absolute zero. [It is only\nvery recently that a unique technique of non-structured tangle (\u00e0 la counterflow\nturbulence) production at very low temperatures was developed by the Manchester group [24].] With recent technological advances this opens an intriguing\npossibility of studying such essentially low-temperature phenomena as, e.g., the\nKelvin-wave cascades.\nHowever, it was recently realized [20] that, at T = 0, the question of how\nthe quasi-classical vortex tangle looks like when one zooms in down to scales of\norder l0 , where the vorticity is essentially discrete, is quite a puzzling problem.\nThe only fact that is immediately clear is that near the scales \u03bbph \u226a l0 where\nthe dissipation due to the sound radiation takes place, the energy flux must be\ntransported by the pure Kelvin-wave cascade. What happens in the intermediate\nregime between the classical Kolmogorov cascade of eddies and the Kelvin-wave\ncascade on individual vortex lines is the subject of this section.\nIn their scenario, L'vov, Nazarenko, and Rudenko [20], noted that a simple picture in which the pure Kelvin-wave cascade supersedes the Kolmogorov regime\nat the scale l0 is not possible. The difficulty is due to the fact that at this scale the\npure Kelvin-wave cascade is unable to sustain the Kolmogorov energy flux (per\nunit mass of the fluid) \u03b5 . Correspondingly, L'vov, Nazarenko, and Rudenko put\nforward an idea of bottleneck accumulation of energy at the classical scales adjacent to l0 . The accumulation of energy in the form of a thermalized distribution of\nquasi-classical vorticity was suggested to be necessary to raise the level of turbulence to a value at which the pure Kelvin-wave cascade becomes efficient. Note,\nhowever, that the concept of bottleneck at a given scale fundamentally relies on\nthe absence of any efficient energy transport mechanism at this scale. Due to this\nfact, under the conditions of Ref. [20], vortex-line reconnections play a fatal role\nfor the bottleneck scenario. Indeed, if the Kolmogorov cascade can reach the scale\nl0 as assumed in Ref. [20], the typical vortex-line curvature at this scale is of the\norder l0 meaning that the vortex-line reconnections must happen due to the tangle\ngeometry, which makes them an alternative energy transport channel to the pure\nKelvin-wave cascade. Estimating the energy flux \u03b5rec processed by the reconnec-\n\n\f25\n\ntions at this scale we see that \u03b5rec /\u03b5 \u223c \u039b 2 \u226b 1, i.e. we are actually dealing with\nan \"anti-bottleneck\"-the reconnections transport an energy flux much larger than\nthe one supplied from the larger scales. The anti-bottleneck is of course forbidden\nby the energy conservation, so we are forced to conclude that the transformation\nof the classical regime must happen already before the scale l0 is reached, and the\nreconnections play a crucial role in this process.\nLet us first analyze the tangle of vortex lines at T = 0 at the length scales\nmuch larger than the typical interline separation under the condition of a developed\nKolmogorov cascade. Although understood intuitively, the ability of the system of\nquantized vortex lines to mimic the classical Kolmogorov cascade is not trivial.\nWe start by a rigorous demonstration of this fact.\nAt T = 0, vortex lines are the only degrees of freedom and their dynamics are completely captured by the Biot-Savart equation (8). The latter can be\nRrewritten in classical3 termsRof vorticity w = curl v in the momentum space, wk =\nw(r) exp[\u2212ik * r] d r = \u03ba exp[\u2212ik * s] ds. The result is identical to the vorticity\nequation for a normal ideal incompressible fluid:\n\n\u2202 wk\n= k\u00d7\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\ni\nd3 q \u22122 h\nq\nw\n\u00d7\n[\nw\n\u00d7\nq\n]\n.\nk\u2212q\nq\n(2\u03c0 )3\n\n(70)\n\nIn view of Eq. (70) we can formulate the conditions, under which the vortex tangle must be automatically equivalent to classical ideal-incompressible-fluid turbulence: (i) the energy must be concentrated at a sufficiently small wavenumber scale\nken \u226a l0\u22121 , and (ii) the decay scenario must be local in the momentum space, so\nthat the quantized nature of vorticity is irrelevant for the long-wavelength behavior. These conditions are not restrictive: (i) is automatically satisfied if turbulence\nis generated by classical means due to the large compared to \u03ba values of the velocity circulation, and (ii) is necessary for the existence of the Kolmogorov cascade\nin classical fluids as well.\nNote that the circulation quantum \u03ba completely drops out of the vorticity equation. This is a manifestation of the known fact that the superfluid hydrodynamics\nis completely described by the classical Euler equation with respect to which the\nquantization of circulation is nothing but an imposed initial condition enforced by\nquantum mechanics-due to the Kelvin theorem, once preformed the velocity circulation is a constant of motion. Since the dynamics of each individual vortex line\nare controlled by the circulation quantum \u03ba , the independence of Eq. (70) on \u03ba\nleads to an important conclusion that any large-scale (classical) motion necessarily\nimplies strong coupling of the underlying vortex lines and that the crossover to the\nquantized regime is due to the self-induced motion of the vortex lines starting to\ndominate over the inter-line coupling. To obtain the corresponding crossover scale\nr0 , let us formally decompose the integral (4) into the self-induced part, vSI (s), for\nwhich the integration is restricted to the vortex line containing the element s, and\nthe remaining contribution induced by all the other lines vI (s),\nv(s) = vSI (s) + vI (s).\n\n(71)\n\nBy the definition of r0 , at length scales r \u226b r0 the turbulence mimics classical\nvorticity taking on the form of a dense coherently moving array of vortex lines\n\n\f26\n\nbent at a curvature radius of order r. The velocity field of this configuration obeys\nthe Kolmogorov law\nr \u226b r0 ,\n(72)\nvr \u223c (\u03b5 r)1/3 ,\nwhere \u03b5 is the energy flux per unit mass of the fluid formed at the energy-containing\neddies and transferred by the cascade. Here and below the subscript r means typical variation of a field over a distance \u223c r. On the other hand, the value of vr\nis fixed by the quantization of velocity circulation around a contour of radius r,\nnamely vr r \u223c \u03ba nr r2 , where nr is the areal density of vortex lines responsible for\nthe vorticity at the scale r. Note that scale invariance requires that on top of vorticity at the scale r there be a fine structure of vortex bundles of smaller sizes, so\nthat, mathematically, nr r2 is the difference between large numbers of vortex lines\ncrossing the area of the contour r in opposite directions. The quantity nr is related\nto the flux by\nh \u03b5 i1/3\n,\nr \u226b r0 .\n(73)\nnr \u223c\n\u03ba 3 r2\nThe underlying dynamics of a single vortex line in the bundle is governed by\nI\nvIr and vSI\nr . While by its definition vr \u223c vr , which is given by Eq. (72), the selfinduced part is determined by the curvature radius r of the vortex line according\nto the LIA, Eq. (11),\n\u03ba\n(74)\nvSI\nr \u223c \u039br ,\nr\nwhere \u039br = ln(r/a\u2217 ). Here and throughout this section, the logarithmic accuracy will be sufficient for the analysis, and, correspondingly, we replace \u039br with\n\u039b = ln(l0 /a0 ). At length scales where vIr \u226b vSI\nr , the vortex lines in the bundle move\ncoherently with the same velocity \u223c vIr . However, at the scale r0 \u223c (\u039b 3 \u03ba 3 /\u03b5 )1/4 ,\nthe self-induced motion of the vortex line becomes comparable to the collective\nI\nmotion, vSI\nr \u223c vr . At this scale, individual vortex lines start to behave independently from each other and thus r0 gives the lower cutoff of the inertial region of\nthe Kolmogorov spectrum (72).\nSince r0 is the size of the smallest classical eddies, the areal density of the\nvortex lines at this scale is given by the typical interline separation, nr0 \u223c 1/l02 . In\nother words, vortex bundles at the scale r0 consist of almost parallel vortex lines\nseparated by the spacing l0 . With Eq. (73), we arrive at\nr0 \u223c \u039b 1/2 l0 ,\n\n(75)\n\nl0 \u223c (\u039b \u03ba 3 /\u03b5 )1/4 .\n(76)\nThe crossover can be also understood in slightly more visual terms. Let us\nintroduce an effective number of vortex lines Nr in a bundle of size r. This number\nis obtained as an algebraic sum of the number of lines going through the bundle\ncross-section in opposite directions and is given by Nr = nr r2 \u223c \u03b5 1/3 r4/3 /\u03ba . In\nview of Eqs. (72), (74), the number of lines in a bundle relative to \u039b determines\nwhether it behaves as a classical eddy or a set of independent vortex lines: Nr \u226b\n\u039b means that the coupling between the vortex lines dominates resulting in the\ncrossover when Nr0 \u223c \u039b . Thus, in the theoretical limit of \u039b \u226b 1 the bundles still\ncontain a large number of vortex lines at the scale where the classical regime\nbreaks down.\nIn the next subsection we shall introduce the cascade mechanism that supersedes the Kolmogorov cascade of eddies at the scales immediately adjacent to r0 .\n\n\f27\n\n5.2 Reconnections of bundles\nThe analysis presented in this and the following section relies on the fact that the\nnumber of vortex lines in a bundle at the crossover scale is large, Nr0 \u226b 1, which,\nin view of Eq. (75), is guaranteed in the limit of large \u039b .\nAt the scale r0 , turbulence consists of randomly oriented vortex-line bundles\nof size r0 formed by the classical regime. The length r0 plays the role of a correlation radius in the sense that relative orientation of two vortex lines (with the\nshort-wavelength structure smoothed out) becomes uncorrelated only if they are\na distance & r0 apart. On the other hand, the crossover to the quantized regime\nmeans that each line starts moving according to its geometric shape, as prescribed\nby Eq. (11). Therefore, reconnections, at least between separate bundles, are inevitable and, as we show below, capable of sustaining the flux \u03b5 .\nThe quantity that will play an important role in the analysis is the energy transferred to a lower scale after one reconnection of vortex lines at the scale k\u22121 ,\nwhich, following Ref. [5], can be written as\n\n\u03b5k \u223c f (\u03b3 ) \u039b \u03c1 \u03ba 2 k\u22121 .\n\n(77)\n\nHere, f (\u03b3 ) is a dimensionless function of the angle \u03b3 at which the vortex lines\ncross (\u03b3 = 0 corresponds to parallel lines). Its asymptotic form is\nf (\u03b3 ) \u223c \u03b3 2 ,\n\n\u03b3 \u226a 1.\n\n(78)\n\nAlthough at the scale r0 there is already no coupling between vortex lines to\nstabilize the bundles, they should still move coherently on the time scale of their\nturnover time since, by the definition of the bundle size r0 , geometry of neighboring lines at this scale is essentially the same over distances . r0 . On the other\nhand, during about one turnover the bundle must cross a neighboring bundle and\nreconnect providing a mechanism of energy transfer to the lower scales. It is possible, however, that vortex lines within the bundle reconnect. One can show that\nsuch processes can not lead to any significant redistribution of energy at the scale\nr0 (but they will play an important role at smaller scales) and thus to a deformation\nof the bundle at this scale because they happen at small angles so that the energy\n(77) is too small. Indeed, the dimensional upper bound on the rate at which two\nlines at a distance l \u226a r0 can cross each other is, from Eq. (11), \u039b \u03ba /r0 l, while\nthe actual value should be much smaller due to the strong correlations between\nline geometries. Taking into account that the number of lines in the bundle is\n(r0 /l0 )2 and that \u03b3 \u223c l/r0 , the contribution to the energy flux from these processes\nis bounded by (l/r0 )\u03b5 . Only when l \u223c r0 the reconnections become important,\nwhich are the reconnections between the whole bundles of size r0 .\nCrossing of the bundles results in reconnections between all their vortex lines\nand Kelvin waves with a smaller but adjacent wavelength \u03bb are generated. This\npicture of bundle crossing was recently corroborated by direct numerical simulations [25]. The coherence of the initial bundles implies that the waves on different\nvortex lines of the same bundle must be generated coherently. Thus, at the scale\nk\u22121 . r0 , adjacent vortex lines should still be almost parallel with Kelvin waves\non them of the wavenumber k and amplitudes bk -vortex lines at the scale k\u22121\nalso form bundles. Similarly, these bundles can reconnect transporting the energy\n\n\f28\n\nto a lower scale, where similar bundle reconnections happen, and so on down the\nscales until the bundle size is comparable to the interline distance and the selfsimilar regime is cut off.\nAn important ingredient of this scenario characterizing the bundles at a scale\n(c)\nk\u22121 is the correlation radius rk of the vortex-line geometry (with the shortwavelength structure smoothed out up to k\u22121 ) in the transverse to the bundle di(c)\nrection. The value of rk determines the distance over which neighboring vortex\nlines can be considered as parallel, i.e. it gives the transverse size of the bundle.\nThis size is due to a finite time required for the Kelvin-wave amplitude at the scale\nk2\u22121 to build up (after a reconnection at a larger scale k1\u22121 > k2\u22121 ), which is of order\nof the wave turnover time, \u03c4k2 \u223c 1/\u03ba\u039b k22 . The Kelvin waves that were generated\nwithin the time \u223c \u03c4k2 are coherent. In other words, as a reconnection of two lines\nhappens at time t = \u03c4k2 at the scale k1\u22121 > k2\u22121 , the lines that reconnected in the\nsame bundle at t = 0 have already-developed waves, which can not be coherent\nwith the waves about to be generated at t & \u03c4k2 . Thus, the distance traveled by the\nbundle at the scale k1\u22121 over the time \u223c \u03c4k2 determines the orientational correla(c)\n(c)\ntion radius at the scale k2 , rk2 = rk2 (k1 ) = bk1 k12 /k22 . Since the scales k1 and k2\nare actually adjacent (i.e. different only by a factor of order unity), we finally get\n(c)\nrk \u223c bk .\nThe spectrum of Kelvin waves bk in this regime can be obtained from the\ncondition \u03b5\u0303k \u2261 \u03b5 , where \u03b5\u0303k is the energy flux per unit mass transported by the\nreconnections at the scale k\u22121 ,\n(c) \u0001\n\u03b5\u0303k \u223c k/\u03c1 [rk ]2 Nk \u03b5k \u03c4k\u22121 .\n(79)\nHere, we take into account that the correlation volume of the reconnection is\n(c)\n[rk ]2 /k, Nk \u223c (bk /l0 )2 is the number of vortex lines participating in the reconnection, and \u03c4k\u22121 \u223c \u03ba\u039b k2 is the rate at which the bundles cross. Physically, bk\ndetermines the typical crossing angle, \u03b3 \u223c bk k, thereby controlling the energy lost\nin one reconnection. From Eq. (79), the spectrum of Kelvin waves in the bundlecrossing regime has the form\nbk \u223c r0\u22121 k\u22122 .\n(80)\n\nAt the wavelength \u223c \u03bbb = \u039b 1/4 l0 , the amplitudes become of order of the interline separation bk \u223c l0 and the notion of bundles looses meaning-the cascade\nof bundles is cut off. The scenario at the scales \u03bb . \u03bbb is rather peculiar and the\nnext subsection is devoted to its description.\n5.3 Reconnections of adjacent lines\nIn the regime of bundle crossings, in view of Eq. (80), the Kelvin-wave amplitudes are steeply decreasing with the wavenumber, so that at the wavelength\n\u03bbb = \u039b 1/4 l0 , where the amplitudes become of order of the interline spacing l0 ,\nthe vortex lines are only slightly bent, bk k \u226a 1. This poses an interesting question\nof what is driving the cascade at the wavelengths below \u03bbb . Since the amplitude\nspectrum can not change discontinuously, at the scales adjacent to \u03bbb we must\n\n\f29\n\nstill have bk k \u226a 1, so that the mechanism of self-reconnections is strongly suppressed. On the other hand, the kinetic times of the purely non-linear regime are\nstill too long to carry the flux \u03b5 [13]. We thus conclude that in some range of length\nscales \u03bbc . \u03bb . \u03bbb there should take place a build up of the relative Kelvin-wave\namplitude supported by the energy flux from the scale \u03bbb until bk k \u223c 1 and the\nself-reconnections can take over the cascade, the amplitudes bk being defined by\nthe condition of constant energy flux per unit length and the crossover scale \u03bbc\nbeing associated with the condition bk\u223c1/\u03bbc \u223c \u03bbc . The observation crucial for understanding the particular mechanism of this regime and thus finding bk is that\neach nearest-neighbor reconnection (happening at the rate \u221d \u039b /\u03bbb2 per each line\nelement of the length \u223c \u03bbb ) performs a sort of parallel processing of the energy distribution for each of the wavelength scales in the range [\u03bbc , \u03bbb ]. For the\ngiven wavelength scale \u03bb \u223c k\u22121 , the energy transferred by a single collision is\n\u221d \u039b (bk k)2 \u03bb , and with the above estimate of the collision rate per the length \u03bbb ,\nthis readily yields the spectrum\nbk \u223c l0 (\u03bbb k)\u22121/2 ,\n\n(81)\n\nand, correspondingly, \u03bbc \u223c l0 /\u039b 1/4 . Note that the rise of the relative amplitude\nbk k \u221d k1/2 implied by Eq. (81) describes the process of fractalization of the vortex\nlines with its culmination around the scale \u03bbc . Thus, in this regime, the energy is\nactually contained at the low-end of the inertial range. We refer to this circumstance as a deposition of energy and discuss the relevance of this term in Sec. 7.\nAlthough the deposition of energy makes this regime formally different from a\nstandard cascade setup, its presence has no effect on the rest of the inertial range\nand thus on the overall cascade efficiency.\n5.4 To the Kelvin-wave cascade\nThe stages of vortex-bundle reconnections and the reconnections between adjacent\nvortex lines essentially complete the transformation of the quasi-classical tangle\nthat is necessary to connect the classical regime to the Kelvin-wave cascades on\nindividual vortex lines. At the wavelengths \u223c \u03bbc the self-reconnections on the vortex lines take over the cascade and the picture at the shorter scales is qualitatively\nnot different from that of the non-structured tangles. The self-reconnection regime\ncontinues in the range \u03bb\u2217 \u226a \u03bb \u226a \u03bbc with the spectrum bk \u223c k\u22121 . At a sufficiently\nsmall wavelength \u03bb\u2217 , the strongly turbulent cascade of Kelvin waves is replaced\nby the purely non-linear cascade. The spectrum of Kelvin-wave amplitudes in the\nnon-linear cascade is given by Eq. (53). The value of \u03bb\u2217 can be determined by\nmatching the energy flux \u03b5 with \u0398 /\u03c1 l02 , where bk\u223c1/\u03bb\u2217 \u223c k\u22121 \u223c \u03bb\u2217 . With Eq. (76),\nwe then obtain\n\u03bb\u2217 = l0 /\u039b 1/2 .\n(82)\nAt T = 0 Kelvin waves decay emitting phonons. This dissipation mechanism\nis negligibly weak all the way down to wavelengths of order \u03bbph , where the rate\nof energy radiation by the vortex lines becomes comparable to \u03b5 . As we show in\nSec. 6 this condition with the estimate for the power of sound radiation by kelvons\nyields\n\u03bbph \u223c \u039b 27/31 [\u03ba /c l0 ]25/31 l0 .\n(83)\n\n\f30\n\nThe scale \u03bbph \u226a \u03bb\u2217 gives the lower dissipative cutoff of the Kelvin-wave cascade.\nThe overall decay scenario is summarized in Fig. 3, where we plot the resulting\nKelvin-wave spectrum in the whole quantized regime.\n\nk\n\nk\n\nclassical cascade\n\nKelvin-wave amplitude\n\nbk\n\n-2\n\n-1/2\n\nk\n\n-1\n\nk\n\n1\n\nr0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n4\n\nc\n\nWavenumber\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nb\n\n-6/5\n\n*\n\nph\n\nk\n\nFig. 3 Spectrum of Kelvin waves in the quantized regime of quasi-classical tangles. The inertial range consists of a chain of cascades driven by different mechanisms: (1) reconnections\nof vortex-line bundles, (2) reconnections between nearest-neighbor vortex lines in a bundle, (3)\nself-reconnections on single vortex lines, (4) non-linear dynamics of single vortex lines without\nreconnections.\n\n5.5 Scanning by finite temperature\nIn this subsection, on the basis of the presented decay scenario at T = 0, we describe a theory of the low-temperature dissipative cutoff of the cascade [15]. We\nshall demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the total vortex-line length\ndensity L comes from the dependence of the wavelength scale \u03bbcuttoff , at which the\ncascade ceases due to the mutual friction of vortex lines with the normal component, on the dimensionless friction coefficient \u03b1 \u221d T 5 (T \u2192 0). The main result\nof the theory is the prediction for the function ln L(ln \u03b1 ), which turns out to have\na very characteristic form reflecting the four qualitatively distinct wavenumber regions of the cascade in the quantized regime. The results of the theory are in an\nexcellent agreement with the recent experiments by Walmsley et al. [19, 24] giving\na strong evidence for the highly nontrivial scenario of low-temperature turbulence\ndecay.\n\n\f31\n\nIf the vortex lines were smooth, the vortex-line density L would be simply\nrelated to the interline separation as L = l0\u22122 . However, the presence of a fine wave\nstructure on the lines can make the total length many times as large as l0\u22122 (or even\ninfinite in the limit of fractal lines). The increase of L due to the presence of KWs\nis related to their spectrum by [5] (cf. Eq. (59))\nln [L(\u03b1 )/L0 ] =\n\nZ kcutoff (\u03b1 )\nk\u0303\n\n(bk k)2 dk/k .\n\n(84)\n\nHere kcutoff \u223c 1/\u03bbcutoff , k\u0303 is the smallest wavenumber of the KW cascade (not to\nbe confused with the smallest wavenumber of the Kolmogorov cascade) at which\nthe concept of a definite cutoff scale is meaningful, and L0 is the \"background\"\nline density corresponding to kcutoff \u223c k\u0303. There is an ambiguity in the definition of\nbk associated with the choice of the spectral width of the scale k, which is fixed in\nEq. (84) by setting the proportionality constant on each side to unity.\nAt T = 0, the cascade is cut off by the radiation of sound (at least in 4 He)\nat the length scale \u03bbcutoff = \u03bbph given by Eq. (83). Changing the temperature one\ncontrols \u03bbcutoff (T ) > \u03bbph in Eq. (84), which allows one to scan the KW cascade observing qualitative changes in L(T ) as \u03bbcutoff traverses different cascade regimes.\nThe existence of a well-defined cutoff is due to the fact that the cascade is supported by rare kinetic events in the sense that the collision time \u03c4coll \u2261 \u03c4coll (\u03b5 , k)\nis much larger than the KW oscillation period, \u03c4per \u2261 \u03c4per (k). The dissipative time\n\u03c4dis \u2261 \u03c4dis (\u03b1 , k) \u223c \u03c4per /\u03b1 , as we show below, is the typical time of the frictional\ndecay of a KW at the scale k. Thus, the cutoff condition is \u03c4dis (\u03b1 , k) \u223c \u03c4coll (\u03b5 , k),\nwhich implies that the energy dissipation rate at a given wavenumber scale becomes comparable to the energy being transferred to higher wavenumber scales\nper unit time by the cascade. It is this condition that defines the cutoff wavenumber\nkcutoff \u2261 kcutoff (\u03b5 , \u03b1 ). Decreasing T and thus \u03b1 (T ), one gradually increases kcutoff ,\nthereby scanning the cascade. In view of Eq. (84), this in principle allows one to\nextract the KW spectrum.\nAt finite T , dissipative dynamics of a vortex line element are described by the\nequation (omitting the third term in the r.h.s., which is irrelevant for dissipation)\n[1, 2]\n\u1e61 = v(s) + \u03b1 s\u2032 \u00d7 [vn (s) \u2212 v(s)] .\n(85)\nHere v(r) is the superfluid velocity field, vn (r) is the normal velocity field, s =\ns(\u03be ,t) is the time-evolving radius-vector of the vortex line element parameterized\nby the arc length, the dot and the prime denote differentiation with respect to time\nand the arc length, respectively.\nAt \u03b1 \u223c 1 the superfluid and normal components are strongly coupled and the\nKWs are suppressed. In this case, the cascade must cease before it enters the\nquantized regime, i.e. \u03bbcuttoff & r0 . If, however, the mutual friction is small, then\n\u03b1 \u22121 \u226b 1 gives the characteristic number of KW oscillations required for the wave\nto decay. Indeed, to the first approximation in 1/\u039b , v(s) in Eq. (85) is given by\nthe local induction approximation (11). In the range \u03bb \u226a r0 , which we will be\ninterested in, the normal component is already laminar and thus the field vn has no\nstructure at these small scales. In addition, as long as \u03b1 \u226a 1, the disturbance of the\nnormal component caused by vortex line motion as these scales can be neglected.\n\n\f32\n\nTherefore, vn (s) can be treated as a constant in Eq. (85), which makes it irrelevant for KW dissipation. In this case, Eqs. (85), (11) give the rate at which the\namplitude bk of a KW with the wavenumber k decays due to the mutual friction,\n\u1e03k \u223c \u2212 \u03b1 \u03c9k bk ,\n\n(86)\n\n\u03a0 (k) \u223c \u03b1 \u03ba \u03c1 \u03c9k2 b2k ,\n\n(87)\n\n(\u03ba /4\u03c0 )\u039b k2 .\n\nHere and below we omit factors\nwhile the KW dispersion is \u03c9k =\nof order unity, which are subject to the definition of the spectral width of the\nwave. These factors can not be found within our theory, but can be extracted from\nexperimental data (as we do it below) and from numerical simulations. Since the\nenergy per unit line length associated with the wave is Ek \u223c \u03ba\u03c1\u03c9k b2k , the power\ndissipated (per unit line length) at the scale \u223c k\u22121 is given by\nwhere \u03c1 is the fluid density. In the following, we analyze ST as \u03b1 (T ) scans\nthrough the regimes summarized in Fig. 3.\nRegime (1).-At this stage the vortex lines are organized in bundles; the amplitudes of waves on these lines are given by Eq. (80). One can estimate the\ntotal power lost due to the friction of these bundles at the wavenumber scale\nr0\u22121 \u226a k \u226a kb \u223c \u03bbb\u22121 per unit mass of the fluid as\n\n\u03b5dis (k) =\n\n1 b2k\n\u03a0 (k) \u223c \u03b1 \u03ba 3 \u039b / l04 .\n\u03c1 b2k l02\n\n(88)\n\nHere, the first factor in the r.h.s. is associated with the correlation volume at this\nscale \u223c b2k k\u22121 and the second one stands for the number of vortex lines in the\nvolume. Note that the dissipated power is constant at all the length scales within\nthis regime and, since the interline separation is related to the Kolmogorov flux by\nEq. (76), it is simply given by \u03b1\u03b5 . Thus, when \u03b1 \u226a 1 the kinetic channel in the\nwhole regime (1) becomes efficient and the cascade reaches the scale \u03bbb , where\nthe notion of bundles becomes meaningless. That is, the regime (1), as opposed\nto the regimes (2)-(4), is not actually scanned by \u03b1 -its inertial range develops\nas a whole while \u03b1 evolves from \u03b1 \u223c 1 to \u03b1 \u226a 1. [In the purely theoretical limit\nof exponentially large \u039b , when the inertial range of the regime (1) occupies many\ndecades, a (loose) dissipative cutoff appears in the regime (1) as well; the cutoff\nwavelength in this case can be roughly estimated as ln(r0 /\u03bbcutoff ) \u223c 1/\u03b1 .]\nRegime (2).-In the range kb \u226a k \u226a kc \u223c \u03bbb\u22121 , the spectrum of KWs is given\nby bk \u223c l0 (kb /k)1/2 (Eq. (80)) which for the dissipated power yields\n\n\u03b5dis (k) \u223c\n\n1\n\u03a0 (k) \u223c \u03b1\u03ba 3 \u039b 7/4 k3 /l0 .\n\u03c1 l02\n\n(89)\n\nThe condition \u03b5dis (k) \u223c \u03b5 gives the cutoff wavenumber\nkcutoff = \u03be2 \u039b \u22121/4 \u03b1 \u22121/3 (2\u03c0 /l0 ) , kb \u226a kcutoff \u226a kc ,\n\n(90)\n\nwhere \u03be2 is some constant of order unity. Then, from Eq. (84) we obtain\nln\n\nL(kcutoff )\n= C2 (kb l0 )2 [kcutoff /kb \u2212 1] .\nL0\n\n(91)\n\n\f33\n\nHere, we set bk = C l0 (kb /k)1/2 , where C is a constant of order unity. The overall\nmagnitude of bk in the other regimes follows then from the continuity.\nRegime (3).-In this regime, supported by self-reconnections, the spectrum\nis given by bk \u223c k\u22121 (up to a logarithmic prefactor). The corresponding energy\nbalance condition yields the cutoff scale:\nkcutoff = \u03be3 (\u039b \u03b1 )\u22121/2 (2\u03c0 /l0 ), kc \u226a kcutoff \u226a k\u2217 .\n\n(92)\n\nWith the logarithmic prefactor taken into account,\nEq. (66), the spectrum in this\n\u221a\nregime reads bk = C[1 + c23 ln(k/kc )]\u22121/2 ( kc kb /k)l0 , where c3 is a constant of\norder unity. Then the relative increase of vortex line density through this regime\nis given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nL(kcutoff )\nkcutoff \u03bd\n2\n,\n(93)\n= 1 + c3 ln\nL(kc )\nkc\nwhere \u03bd = C2 kc kb l02 /c23 .\nRegime (4).-Since the spectrum of the purely nonlinear regime, bk \u223c k\u22126/5 ,\n(Eq. (53)) is steeper than the marginal bk \u223c k\u22121 meaning that the integral in\nEq. (84) builds up at the lower limit, as soon as kcutoff & k\u2217 the line density\nL(kcutoff ) starts to saturate and becomes independent of kcutoff at kcutoff \u226b k\u2217 . The\nenergy balance gives the dependence kcutoff (\u03b1 ),\nkcutoff = \u03be4 \u039b \u22123/4 \u03b1 \u22125/8 (2\u03c0 /l0 ), kcutoff \u226b k\u2217 ,\n\n(94)\n\nwhere \u03be4 is an unknown constant. The coefficient in the KW spectrum is fixed by\ncontinuity with the previous regime, yielding\n\u221a\n1/5\nbk = C[1 + c23 ln(k\u2217 /kc )]\u22121/2 kc kb k\u2217 k\u22126/5 l0 . Eq.

Fit of the experimental data (closed circles and triangles) adapted from\nRef. [24] (l0 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm giving \u039b \u2248 13). The high temperature measurements of Refs. [31],\n[18] are represented by open squares and open triangles respectively. The form of \u03b1 (T ) is taken\naccording to Ref. [44] at T & 0.5K (roton scattering) and according to Ref. [35] at T . 0.5K\n(phonon scattering). The fitting parameters are A2 \u2248 0.25, A4 \u2248 0.26, c3 \u2248 3.0, \u03bd \u2248 0.14 with\n\u03b1b \u2248 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 , \u03b1c \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , \u03b1\u2217 \u223c 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\nAlthough the excellent quantitative agreement with the experiments can be\nsceptically attributed to the large number of fitting parameters, it is remarkable\nthat the nontrivial qualitative behavior of L(\u03b1 ) exhibits the form peculiar to our\ndecay scenario. As \u03b1 decreases from \u03b1 \u223c 1 to the values significantly smaller\nthan unity, the line density L increases only by some factor close to unity (\u223c 1.5\nin the experiment), which reflects the formation of the regime (1) driven by the\nreconnections of vortex bundles. During the crossover from the region (1) to (2),\nthe increase of L is minimal-a shoulder in the curve L(\u03b1 ) arises. It is only well\ninside the region (2) that the increase of L becomes progressively pronounced,\nand, at the crossover to the region (3), the function L(\u03b1 ) achieves its maximal\nslope, determined by the developed fractalization of the vortex lines necessary to\nsupport the cascade within the interval (3). As the cutoff moves along the interval\n(3) towards higher wavenumbers, the slope of L(\u03b1 ) becomes less steep due to\nthe logarithmic decrease of the characteristic amplitude of KW turbulence. When\nthe cutoff passes the crossover to the regime (4), the curve L(\u03b1 ) gradually levels.\n\n\f35\n\nFig. 5 Spectrum of Kelvin waves in the quantized regime quantified, apart from the regime (1),\nby the fit to experimental data, Fig. 4. In view of Eq. (84), the constants C and \u03be2 can be found\nonly in the combination \u03be2C \u2248 0.049. The regimes (1)-(4) correspond to those in Fig. 3.\n\n[Note that because of the closeness of the KW spectra in the regimes (3) and\n(4) the crossover between them, as expected, is not distinct, which results in a\nsignificant uncertainty in the choice of \u03b1\u2217 .] Fitting the experimental data fixes the\nvalues of the dimensionless parameters, thus revealing the quantitative form of\nthe KW spectrum shown in Fig. 5. Note, however, that in view of the fact that the\nexperimental \u039b \u223c 10 is not so large we would expect certain systematic deviations,\nbut a significant scatter of the experimental data does not allow us to assess them.\n6 Kelvon-Phonon interaction\n6.1 Hydrodynamic action. Hamiltonian of Kelvon-Phonon interaction\nThe general problem of kelvon interaction with other modes is relevant far beyond\nthe scope of superfluid turbulence. Since the early study of phonon scattering by\nvortex lines [45], much interest has been attracted by the problems of the interaction of Kelvin waves with density-distortion modes [8, 10, 41, 46, 47, 48]. In\nneutron stars, the excitation of Kelvin waves due to the interaction with the nuclei\nin the solid crust is suggested to be the main mechanism of pulsar glitches [41].\nNonlinear kelvon dynamics is also becoming an attractive topic in the field of\nultra-cold gases, where one can study kelvon coupling to the modes of the BoseEinstein condensate in situ, as, e.g., in the problem of kelvon excitation by the\nquadrupole mode [46, 47, 48]\nIn this section we describe a systematic approach (developed by the authors in\nRef. [15]) to the problem of interaction of phonons with vortices in the hydrody-\n\n\f36\n\nnamic regime, i.e. when any physical length scale is much larger than the vortex\ncore size a0 , which allows one to describe vortices as geometrical lines [1]. We\nderive the interaction Hamiltonian basing the analysis on the small parameter\n\n\u03b2 = a0 k\u0303 \u226a 1,\n\n(98)\n\nwhere k\u0303 is the largest wave number among kelvons and phonons. To employ the\ntransparent description in terms of the normal modes, we confine ourselves to\nthe case of weak nonlinearity, which for kelvons implies the small parameter \u03b1 ,\nEq. (30), meaning that the amplitudes bk of the Kelvin waves of the typical wavelength \u03bb \u223c k\u22121 are much smaller than \u03bb , \u03b1k = bk k \u226a 1. For phonons this requires\nthat \u03b7 \u226a n, where \u03b7 is the number density fluctuation in a sound wave and n is\nthe average number density. The obtained result allows us to rigorously describe\nthe radiation of sound by kelvons, which we apply to the problem of superfluid\nturbulence decay at zero temperature in the next subsection.\nLet us first describe the qualitative ideas behind the derivation. The condition (98) implies that the typical vortex-line velocities are much smaller than the\nspeed of sound. Along with \u03b7 \u226a n it leads to the fact that the vortex-phonon coupling contributes only small corrections to the dynamics of the non-interacting\nvortex and phonon subsystems. Therefore, a perturbative approach is applicable, provided the interaction energy is written in terms of the canonical variables. Normally, the form of the canonical variables comes from the solution\nof the interaction-free dynamics. However, when studying vortices separate from\nphonons, one naturally neglects the compressibility of the fluid, which we did in\nSec. 2, since finite compressibility leads only to higher-order \"relativistic\" corrections to vortex dynamics. As a result, the dynamics of vortices are described by\nthe Hamiltonian (29), written in terms of the geometrical configuration of the vortex lines. When the vortices are absent, the phonon modes come from the bilinear\nHamiltonian for the density fluctuation \u03b7 (r,t) and the phase field \u03c6 (r,t), which\ndetermines the velocity in the density wave (see, e.g., [49]). If finite compressibility of a superfluid is taken into account in order to join the subsystems, the\npositions of vortices and the fields \u03b7 (r,t), \u03c6 (r,t) are no longer the sets of canonical variables because of the variable-mixing term in the Lagrangian. This makes\nthis perturbative problem quite peculiar since introducing the interaction, one has\nto simultaneously reconsider the canonical variables.\nOne can easily see that the standard vortex parametrization used in Sec. 2 fails\nto capture the physics of vortices when phonons are present. In Eq. (4), the geometrical position of the vortex lines unambiguously determines the instantaneous\nvelocity field configuration at arbitrary distances, which is inconsistent with the\nfinite velocity of propagation of excitations in a compressible medium. From this\nsimple physical argument, we can already guess the form of the canonical variables: the long-distance part of the velocity field produced by vortices in Eq. (4)\nshould actually belong to phonons.\nThe small parameters allow us to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the canonical variables by means of a systematic iterative procedure. Physically, the procedure restores the retardation in the adjustment of the superfluid velocity field to the\nevolving vortex configuration. It qualitatively changes the structure of the Hamiltonian with respect to the terms responsible for the radiation of sound and the\nrelativistic corrections to the vortex dynamics.\n\n\f37\n\nHydrodynamic Lagrangian: standard parametrization. Long-wave superfluid\ndynamics at zero temperature are described by the Popov's hydrodynamic action\n[50]:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n(n + \u03b7 )\n1 2\n|\u2207\u03a6 |2 \u2212\n\u03b7 .\n(99)\nS = dt d 3 r \u2212(n + \u03b7 )\u03a6\u0307 \u2212\n2m0\n2\u03ba\nHere the spatial integral is taken over the macroscopic fluid volume, \u03a6 (r,t) is the\nphase field, which determines the velocity according to v = (1/m0 )\u2207\u03a6 (h\u0304 = 1),\nm0 is the mass of a particle, \u03ba is the compressibility, the dot denotes thep\nderivative\nwith respect to time, and the microscopic length scale is defined by a0 = \u03ba/nm0 .\nThe vortex core radius is of order a0 .\nThe phase \u03a6 is non-single-valued and contains topological defects, the vortex\nlines. The velocity circulation around each vortex line is quantized:\nI\n\n\u2207\u03a6 (r) * dr = 2\u03c0 .\n\n(100)\n\nThe defects can be separated from the regular contribution:\n\n\u03a6 = \u03a60 + \u03c6 ,\n\n(101)\n\nwhere \u03a60 is non-single-valued and satisfies (100), while \u03c6 is regular and \u2207\u03c6 is\ncirculation-free. The standard decomposition into vortices and phonons is done by\nintroducing an additional constraint that to the zeroth approximation eliminates\nthe coupling between \u03a60 and \u03c6 in the Hamiltonian, namely\n\n\u2206 \u03a60 (r) = 0.\n\n(102)\n\n(Physically, this parametrization is suggested by the velocity potential of an incompressible fluid.)

Following standard perturbative procedure, we first neglect the coupling between the vortex and phonons to find the non-interacting\nnorR\nmal modes. The vortex part of the Lagrangian is then given by Lvor = \u2212n d 3 r \u03a6\u03070 \u2212\nHvor . For the sake of simplicity, from now on we consider a solitary vortex line;\n\n\f38\n\nthe generalization\n\u0001 is straightforward. Let the two-dimensional vector \u03c1 0 (z0 ) =\nx0 (z0 ), y0 (z0 ), 0 describe the position of the vortex line in the plane z = z0 of a\nCartesian coordinate system, where the z-direction is chosen along the vortex line.\nThe field \u03a60 is a functional of \u03c1 0 (z), hence\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u03c10 *\nd 3 r \u03a6\u03070 = dz \u03c1\u0307\n\n\u03b4\nd 3 r \u03a60 .\n\u03b4\u03c10\nZ\n\n(107)\n\nTo obtain d 3 r \u03a6\u03070 , it is sufficient to calculate the integral d 3 r \u03b4 \u03a60 , where \u03b4 \u03a60\nis the variation of the phase field due to the distortion of the vortex line by \u03b4 \u03c1 0 (z).\nUsing the identity \u2206 (\u03c1 2 ) = 4, with \u03c1 = (x, y, 0), and Eq. (102), obtain\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 3\nd 3 r \u03b4 \u03a60 =\nd r \u2207 * \u03b4 \u03a60 \u2207(\u03c1 2 ) .\n(108)\n4\nThe variation \u03b4 \u03a60 (r) can be viewed as being produced by two vortex lines with\nopposite circulation quanta and separated by \u03b4 \u03c1 0 (z). In view of Eq. (100) the field\n\u03b4 \u03a60 (r) experiences a jump of 2\u03c0 across the surface S that extends between these\nvortex lines along the vector field \u03b4 \u03c1 0 (z), therefore the integration volume must\nhave a cut along S . HApplying the Gauss theorem, we rewrite Eq. (108) as the\nsurface integral (1/2) S \u03b4 \u03a60 (\u03c1 * dS) yielding\nR\n\nR\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(109)\n\u03c1 0 (z).\nd 3 r \u03a6\u03070 = \u03c0 dz [\u1e91 \u00d7 \u03c1 0 (z)] * \u03c1\u0307\np\n\u0002\n\u0003\nIntroducing the complex variable w(z) = nm0 \u03ba /2 x(z) + iy(z) , where \u03ba =\n2\u03c0 /m0 is the velocity circulation quantum, obtain\nZ \u0002\n\u0003\n1\ndz iw\u2217 \u1e87 \u2212 i\u1e87\u2217 w \u2212 Hvor [w, w\u2217 ],\n(110)\nLvor =\n2\nwhich implies that w(z) and w\u2217 (z) are the canonical variables with respect to Lvor .\nThe energy (104), rewritten in terms of w(z) and w\u2217 (z) gives the vortex Hamiltonian (20), or the pseudo-Hamiltonian (29) with an appropriate regularization.\nWe need only the bilinear term of the expanded with respect to \u03b1k \u226a 1 Hamiltonian since the kelvon interactions are irrelevant for our problem. We change the\nnotation for the kelvon spectrum reserving \u03c9q for phonons:\n\u03ba\nHvor \u2248 \u2211 \u03b5k a\u2020k ak , \u03b5k =\n[ln(1/ka0 ) +C0 ] k2 ,\n(111)\n4\n\u03c0\nk\nwith ak and a\u2020k defined in Sec. 2. The sound waves are described by the Lagrangian\nR\nLph = d 3 r (\u2212\u03b7 \u03c6\u0307 ) \u2212 Hph [\u03b7 , \u03c6 ], with Hph given by (105). We assume that the system is contained in a cylinder of radius R with the symmetry axis along the zdirection and that the system is periodic along z with the period L. In the cylindrical geometry, the phonon fields \u03b7 (r, \u03b8 , z), \u03c6 (r, \u03b8 , z) are parametrized by phonon\ncreation and annihilation operators cs , c\u2020s as\np\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b7 = \u2211 \u03c9s \u03ba / 2 \u03c7s cs + \u03c7s\u2217 c\u2020s ,\ns\n\n\u03c6 = \u2212i \u2211\ns\n\np\n\n1 / 2 \u03c9s \u03ba\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u03c7s cs \u2212 \u03c7s\u2217 c\u2020s ,\n\n\u03c7s = \u03c7s (r, \u03b8 , z) = Rmqr(r) Ym(\u03b8 ) Zqz(z),\n\n(112)\n\n\f39\n\nwhere Rmqr (r) = (\u03c0 qr /R)1/2 Jm (qr r), Ym(\u03b8 ) = (2\u03c0 )\u22121/2 exp(im\u03b8 ), Zqz(z) = L\u22121/2 exp(iqz z),\ns stands for {qr , m, qz }, and Jm (x) are the Bessel functions of the first kind. The\nphonon Hamiltonian then reads\nHph = \u2211 \u03c9s c\u2020s cs , \u03c9s = c q,\n\n(113)\n\ns\n\np\np\nwith q = q2r + q2z and c = n/\u03bam0 = 1/m0 a0 .\nThe effect of coupling: change of canonical variables. Now we address the\ncoupling between phonons and vortices. In terms of the obtained variables, the\nLagrangian (103) takes on the form\nL = \u2211 i \u0227k a\u2020k + \u2211 i \u010bs c\u2020s \u2212 T \u2212 H,\nk\n\n(114)\n\ns\n\n\u2032 .\nwhere T = d 3 r \u03b7 \u03a6\u03070 \u2261 T {ak , \u0227k , a\u2020k , \u0227\u2020k , cs , \u010bs , c\u2020s , \u010b\u2020s }, and H = Hvor + Hph + Hint\nThe coupling term T plays a special role in the Lagrangian (114). This term is linear in time derivatives of the variables and thus can not contribute to the energy in\naccordance with the Lagrangian formalism. Moreover, because of the time derivatives in T , the equations of motion in terms of {ak , a\u2020k }, {cs , c\u2020s } take on a nonHamiltonian form. This implies that the chosen variables become non-canonical\nin the presence of the interaction, and therefore the total energy, H, in these variables can not be identified with the Hamiltonian.\nThere must exist such a variable transformation {ak , a\u2020k }, {cs , c\u2020s } \u2192 {\u00e3k , \u00e3\u2020k }, {c\u0303s , c\u0303\u2020s }\nthat restores the canonical form of the Lagrangian, L = \u2211k i \u00e3 \u0307 k \u00e3\u2020k + \u2211s i c\u0303 \u0307 s c\u0303\u2020s \u2212\nH{\u00e3k , \u00e3\u2020k , c\u0303s , c\u0303\u2020s }. The canonical variables are obtained by the following iterative\nprocedure. The term T is expanded with respect to \u03b1k \u226a 1, \u03b2 \u226a 1 and \u03b7 \u226a n\n(1)\nyielding T = T (1) + T (2) + * * *. Then the variables are adjusted by ak \u2192 ak + ak ,\n\nR\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\ncs \u2192 cs + cs , where ak ({ak , a\u2020k , cs , c\u2020s }) and cs ({ak , a\u2020k , cs , c\u2020s }) are chosen to\neliminate the term T (1) in (114). As a result, T \u2192 0 + T \u2032(2) + * * *, where the\nprime means that the structure of the remaining terms has changed. At the next\n(2)\n(2)\nstep, T \u2032(2) is eliminated by ak \u2192 ak + ak , cs \u2192 cs + cs and so on. By con(1)\n\n(2)\n\nstruction, the canonical variables are given by \u00e3k = ak + ak + ak + * * *, c\u0303s =\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\ncs + cs + cs + * * *, and likewise for the conjugates. In practice, only the first few\nterms are enough, as the rest ones give just higher-order corrections.\nThe explicit expression for T is obtained following the steps of the derivation\nof Eq. (109). The only difference here is that the role of the auxiliary function \u03c1 2\nis played by Q, defined by \u2206 Q(r) \u2261 \u03b7 (r):\nZ\n\n\u03c1 0 (z).\nT = 2\u03c0 dz [\u1e91 \u00d7 \u2207Q(\u03c1 0 (z), z)] * \u03c1\u0307\n\n(115)\n\nIn accordance with qr \u03c10 \u223c \u03b2 k\u03c10 \u226a 1, we expand the radial functions, retaining\nonly the greatest term for each particular angular momentum m.

It can be checked\nR\nstraightforwardly, that the term \u221d d 3 r \u03b7 \u2207\u03c6 * \u2207\u03a60 in Eq. (106) gives Fetter's\namplitudes of the elastic and inelastic scattering of phonons [45] (see, however,\nSec. 6.3). In addition, this term leads to a macroscopically small splitting of the\nphonon spectrum due to the superimposed fluid circulation.\nA kelvon carries a quantum of (negative) angular momentum projection. The\ninteraction (121) explicitly conserves the angular momentum: a real process of the\nemission of a phonon with the angular momentum (\u2212m) requires an annihilation\nof m kelvons.\nR\n\n\f41\n\n6.2 Sound emission by Kelvin-wave cascade\nSince \u03b5k \u223c (a0 k)\u03c9k , the total momentum transferred to phonons in a radiation\nevent should be small in order to satisfy the energy conservation. Thus, the radiation by one kelvon on an infinite line is kinematically suppressed. The leading\nradiation process is the emission of the m = \u22122 (quadrupole) phonon mode, the\nevents involving more than two kelvons being suppressed by R\u03b1k \u226a 1. First-order\nprocesses of the two-phonon emission come from the term \u221d d 3 r \u03b7 \u2207\u03c6 * \u2207\u03a60 of\n(106). The amplitude of these processes is suppressed by the relativistic parameter\n\u03b2 \u226a 1.\nThe qualitative observation that the sound emission is due to the quadrupole\nradiation is already sufficient to restore the formula for the power \u03a0k radiated by\nthe Kelvin waves at the wavenumber scale k per unit vortex-line length. From general hydrodynamics [51], \u03a0k must be proportional to the square of the third-order\ntime derivative of the quadrupole moment, \u221d \u03b5k6 b2k b2\u2212k , and inversely proportional\nto the fifth power of the sound velocity c. The rest of the dimensional coefficients\nare restored unambiguously, since the only remaining time and length scales are\nset by \u03ba and k and the dimensions of mass come from the fluid density \u03c1 = nm0 ,\nwhich yields\n\u03b5 6k\n\u03ba 2\u03c1\n\u03a0k \u223c 5 \u03b5k6 b2k b2\u2212k \u223c 5k nk n\u2212k .\n(122)\nc k\nc \u03c1\nThis result is valid up to dimensionless prefactors of order unity.\nWe can use the Hamiltonian (121) to obtain an accurate formula for the turbulence decay rate due to the sound radiation. The kelvon occupation number decay\nrate is given by \u1e45k = \u2212 \u2211s,k1 Ws,k,k1 , where Ws,k,k1 is the probability of the event\n|0s , nk , nk1 i \u2192 |1s , nk \u22121, nk1 \u22121 i per unit time. Applying the Fermi Golden Rule\nto Ws,k,k1 with the interaction (121) and replacing the sums by integrals, obtain\n\u1e45k = \u2212\n\n\u00035\n(\u03ba /2\u03c0 )5 \u0002\nln(1/a\u2217 k) +C0 (k/c)5 k5 n2k .\n15\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(123)\n\nThe total power radiated by kelvons per unit vortex-line length is then obtained\nfrom \u03a0k = \u2212 \u2211k\u2032 \u223ck \u03b5k\u2032 \u1e45k\u2032 /L, which allows to restore the dimensionless prefactors\nin Eq. (122). However, since the theories of non-structured and quasi-classical\ntangles can not trace coefficients of order unity we shall confine ourselves to using\nEq. (122) for determining the cascade cutoff scale \u03bbph .\nIn both non-structured and quasi-classical tangles, at the high wavenumbers\nwhere sound radiation becomes appreciable, turbulence decay is due to the purely\nnonlinear Kelvin-wave cascade with the spectrum given by Eq. (53). The condition\nfor finding the cutoff scale \u03bbph is \u03a0kph \u223c \u03b8 . Clearly, the value of \u03b8 depends on the\nstructure of the tangle. In non-structured tangles \u03b8ns \u223c \u03ba 3 \u03c1\u039b 2 /l02 , where l0 is the\ninterline separation and \u039b = ln(l0 /a\u2217 ), which gives\n\n\u03bbph \u223c \u039b 24/31 [\u03ba /c l0 ]25/31 l0 (non \u2212 structured tangles).\n\n(124)\n\n\u03bbph \u223c \u039b 27/31 [\u03ba /c l0 ]25/31 l0 (quasi \u2212 classical tangles).\n\n(125)\n\nFor the quasi-classical tangles \u03b8qc \u223c \u03b5\u03c1 l02 , which with the Eq. 76 gives \u03b8qc \u223c\n\u223c \u03b8ns /\u039b . Thus, for the cascade cutoff we obtain\n\n\u03ba 3 \u03c1\u039b /l02\n\n\f42\n\nA comment is in order here. In superfluid turbulence, kelvons do not live on\ninfinite vortex lines, as we assumed throughout this section, but are superimposed\non vortex kinks with a typical curvature radii R0 much larger than the kelvon\nwavelength, R0 \u226b k\u22121 . This circumstance led Vinen [10] to obtain a dimensional\nestimate \u03a0k\u2032 \u221d b2k \u221d nk for the power radiated per unit length of the vortex line,\nwhich is qualitatively different from our Eq. (122). In the quasi-particle language,\n\u03a0k\u2032 implies that the radiation is governed by the conversion of one kelvon into a\nphonon. Vinen argues that this process becomes allowed in due to the finite size\nof the kinks, or, equivalently, the kelvon coupling to a kink lifts the ban on singlekelvon radiative processes by effectively removing the momentum conservation\nconstraint. We note that the probabilities of such elementary events are likely to\nbe suppressed exponentially, as it is generically the case, say, for soliton-phonon\ninteractions (see, e.g., Ref. [52] and references therein.) The processes involving\nkelvon-kink coupling should contain an exponentially small factor \u223c exp(\u2212R0 k),\nwhich arises from the convolution of the smooth kink profile with the oscillating\nkelvon mode.\n\n6.3 Elastic and inelastic phonon scattering\nThe main advantage of the Hamiltonian formalism developed here is that it allows\nto reduce dynamics to elementary scattering events tractable by the standard scattering theory, thereby providing a general systematic and physically transparent\ntheoretical tool. So far, the Hamiltonian framework allowed us to address the most\nimportant remaining problems of vortex dynamics-reconnection-free kinetics of\nKelvin waves and phonon radiation by Kelvin waves. The purpose of this section\nis to use the developed formalism to revisit the longstanding problem of phonon\nscattering on vortex lines. The interest to this problem has been maintained by\nthe controversy on the value of the elastic scattering cross-section and the corresponding force between a vortex and the normal component (see Ref. [53] and\nreferences therein). The elastic scattering cross-section was originally obtained by\nPitaevskii [54] and later confirmed by Sonin (Ref. [53] and references therein) basing on hydrodynamic equations of motion. However, the Hamiltonian approach to\nthis problem suggested by Fetter [45] (and rederived later in Ref. [55]) gave a different result. Within the formalism developed in this section it is straightforward\nto see, as we do here by means of a direct calculation, that the discrepancy is due\nto the non-canonicity of the standard vortex and phonon parametrization used in\nthe Hamiltonian of Ref. [45]. The result of Ref. [45] actually corresponds to the\ncase of a pinned vortex, which was first noted by Sonin [53], and the effect of vortex motion during the scattering is properly accounted for by the transformation\nto the canonical variables.\nWe also discuss inelastic phonon scattering and show that the only available\nto our knowledge solution of Ref. [45] suffers from the same problem: the noncanonicity of the variables overlooked there makes a non-trivial contribution to the\nscattering cross-section. The accurate result can be obtained from a finite number\nof diagrams presented here (Fig. 8), but in view of the length of the resulting\nexpression and absence of its immediate application, we do not derive it in a closed\nform here.\n\n\f43\n\nVortex-phonon Hamiltonian in the plain-wave basis for phonon fields. For\nour purposes, it will be convenient to rewrite the vortex-phonon Hamiltonian of\nSec. 6.1 in the plane-wave basis for the phonon fields explicitly obtaining the\nterms responsible for phonon scattering:\nq\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b7 (r) = \u2211 \u03c9q \u03ba /2V eiqr cq + e\u2212iqr c\u2020q ,\nq\n\n\u03c6 (r) = \u2212i \u2211\n\nq\n\nq\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1/2V \u03c9q \u03ba eiqr cq \u2212 e\u2212iqr c\u2020q ,\n\n(126)\n\nwhere \u03c9q = c q and V = L3 is the system volume.

(1), (30), (98)-and (approximately) conserving quantities (energy, momentum, number of kelvons, LIA constants of motion), characterizing the phenomenon, bring about rich physics on one\nhand, and provide a solid basis for applicability of the analytic tools on the other.\nThe central part in the theory is played by the large parameter \u039b , Eq. (1).\nImplications of the condition \u039b \u226b 1 include (i) universality of the answers for\nall U(1)-type superfluids, (ii) applicability of LIA, (iii) features following from\n\n\f48\n\n(ii), of which the most important ones are (a) the integrability of LIA suppressing\nthe efficiency of the pure Kelvin-wave cascade and (b) preemptive character of\nthe self-induced motion of the vortices in the smallest Richardson-Kolmogorov\neddies, responsible for cutting off the classical-fluid regime before it could experience a potential bottleneck associated with (a).\nThe energy and momentum conservation renders impossible the pure vortex\nring cascade (originally proposed by Feynman) in which superfluid turbulence is\nsupposed to decay into small rings in such a way that each ring produces smaller\nones independently of the rest of the vortex tangle. The absence of pure Feynman's cascade and suppressed efficiency of the pure Kelvin-wave cascade create\nspecific circumstances under which there exists a range in the kelvon wavenumber\nspace-with the size controlled by \u039b -where the Kelvin-wave cascade is driven\nby this or that type of vortex line reconnections. The reconnections lift the integrability constraint of the LIA and push the vortex-line length to higher and higher\nwavenumbers.\nIn the theoretical limit of really large \u039b (to be taken with a grain of salt in view\nof realistic \u039b . 15 in 4 He), we predict three distinct types of reconnection-driven\nKelvin-wave cascades. The first two ones (in the down-the-cascade order)-(i)\nvortex-bundle-reconnection-based and (ii) neighboring-line-reconnection-based-\napply only to the Richardson-Kolmogorov quasi-classical regime, while the third\none, driven by local self-crossings, applies to non-structured tangles as well, including superfluid turbulence sustained by vibrating objects. At large-enough wavenumbers, the local-self-crossings-driven cascade naturally crosses over to the pure\nKelvin-wave cascade, as soon as the power of the latter becomes sufficient to compete with the former, eventually suppressing the reconnections by rendering the\namplitude of Kelvin waves small compared to their wavelength.\nAt T = 0, the inertial range of the pure Kelvin-wave cascade is controlled\nby the small parameter \u03b2 , defined in Eq. (98), that guarantees irrelevance of\ncompressibility and/or kelvon-phonon interaction before the cascade reaches the\nwavelength scale \u03bb \u223c \u03bbph , where phonon emission becomes dominant, cutting\nthe cascade off. In a typical case, 1/\u03b2 \u226b \u039b \u223c ln(1/\u03b2 ), implying that the inertial\nrange of of the pure Kelvin-wave cascade is significantly larger than that of the\nreconnection-driven cascade(s).\nKinetics of the pure Kelvin-wave cascade are perturbative due to the asymptotically vanishing amplitude-to-wavelength ratio. This allows one to introduce\na kinetic equation with the collision term associated with kelvon scattering. Because of the conservation of the total number of kelvons (which is nothing but\nthe conservation of the angular momentum) and one-dimensional character of the\nproblem, the leading kinetic process is the elastic three-kelvon scattering. As an\neffect of the LIA integrability constraint, the kinetics are entirely due to the interactions going beyond the LIA: the local contributions to the effective three-kelvon\nscattering amplitude exactly cancel each other leaving no order-\u039b collision terms\nand suppressing kinetic rates.\nThe small amplitude of Kelvin waves at the dissipative cutoff wavenumbers\nand weak kelvon-phonon coupling guaranteed by the parameter \u03b2 imply that the\nphonon emission is a perturbative process that can be naturally described within\nthe Hamiltonian formalism. Our derivation of the kelvon-phonon Hamiltonian revealed a subtlety of non-canonicity of the prime harmonic variables with respect to\n\n\f49\n\nthe interaction Hamiltonian. Adequately accounting for this fact at the level of hydrodynamic action leads to a proper kelvon-phonon interaction Hamiltonian, containing terms that would be missed otherwise. With this Hamiltonian the problem\nof the phonon cutoff of the Kelvin-wave cascade becomes rather straightforward.\nThe leading process is two-kelvon inelastic scattering converting two kelvons with\nalmost opposite momenta into one phonon. As a by-product, we resolved some\nlong-standing controversies of the kelvon-phonon interaction, showing that these\nwere due to the above-mentioned lacking terms in the interaction Hamiltonian.\n[We also revealed the role of a hidden phonon-vortex interaction in the theory of\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition [58], which is not covered here.]\nHaving at hand a complete theoretical scenario for superfluid turbulence at\nT = 0, it is important to check it against experiment and numeric simulations.\nDiscussing first the more simple case of non-structured turbulence, we note that a\ncircumstantial evidence for the Kelvin-wave cascade-the absence of temperature\ndependence of the relaxation time superfluid turbulence in 4 He at T < 70mK-\nhas been observed in both experiment [7] and simulations [9]. The simulation of\nRef. [9], performed within LIA (and after Ref. [5] was published), could potentially identify the local self-crossings driven cascade. Moreover, the authors did\nobserve production of vortex rings. However, they interpreted that as the pure\nFeynman's cascade. A direct numeric support for the local self-crossing scenario\ncan be found in Ref. [17], where the behavior of a vortex line attached to a vibrating object was studied within the LIA. It was observed that as a response to the\nexternal perturbation the vortex line gets kinky, after which frequent local selfcrossings result in a systematic production of vortex rings.\nStill very desirable is a simulation of the zero-temperature decay of nonstructured turbulence within the full Biot-Savart description. Such a simulation\ncould quantify our very rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the crossover between local-self-crossing-driven and pure Kelvin-wave cascades and answer the\nfundamental question of whether the inertial range of the cascade of self-crossings\nis large enough for realistic \u039b . 15 to be taken seriously in the experimental context.\nTurning now to the Richardson-Kolmogorov regime, we emphasize the recent\nexperimental progress [19] that allowed to probe the vortex line length as a function of temperature. As we discussed in Sec. 5, the experiment is in a very good\nqualitative agreement with our crossover scenario, the observed pronounced increase of the vortex line length at friction coefficient \u223c 10\u22123 being indicative of\nthe line fractalization. Nevertheless, it is still a circumstantial rather than direct\nevidence. A direct experimental evidence for the local self-crossings driven scenario might be an observation of small vortex rings emitted by spatially localized\nRichardson-Kolmogorov superfluid turbulence.\nOn the theoretical side, a simulation of the crossover from Richardson-Kolmogorov to Kelvin-wave regime might be very instructive, especially given that numerically one can set \u039b to be arbitrarily large to render the role of this parameter more pronounced. Yet another missing theoretical piece-in view of only an\norder-of-magnitude estimate and a technical mistake in our Ref. [13], mentioned\nin Sec. 3-is an accurate result for the numerical prefactor in the energy flux of\nthe pure Kelvin-wave cascade, Eq. (43).\n\n\f50\n\nSummarizing our results for the crossover from Richardson-Kolmogorov to\nKelvin-wave regime, we cannot leave without a discussion the work by L'vov,\nNazarenko, and Rudenko [20], which triggered our interest to the problem. As\ndiscussed in Sec. 5, the authors of Ref. [20] put forward an idea of bottleneck\naccumulation of energy in the wavenumber space between the classical-field hydrodynamic modes and Kelvin waves. The notion of bottleneck in Ref. [20] is\nunequivocally defined as being associated with the absence of any channel capable of accommodating the energy flux produced by the Richardson-Kolmogorov\ncascade, which implies thermalization of hydrodynamic modes in a certain range\nof length scales above the Kelvin-wave regime. In our Ref. [21] (see also Sec. 5),\nwe pointed out that this idea is inconsistent with the above-mentioned preemptive\nrole of reconnections as an energy transport mechanism. While agreeing with us\n[57, 22] on the importance of the self-induced motion of vortices in the smallest-\nof the size \u223c r0 defined in Eq. (75)-Richardson-Kolmogorov eddies, and attempting to revise their theory accordingly in Ref. [22], the same authors still insist\non unimportance of reconnections and support the bottleneck idea. Note, however, that once we start from the grounds that the self-induced motion dominates\nvortex-line dynamics, reconnections are unavoidable-the lines simply do not interact with each other, and thus there is nothing to stop them from coming into\na direct contact and reconnecting. We explicitly demonstrate in Sec. 5 that these\nreconnections serve as an efficient channel of transferring the energy flux to lower\nscales thereby ruling out a possibility of the bottleneck.\nIn a certain loose sense, term 'bottleneck' might be associated with the phenomenon of fractalization of vortex lines (cf. Ref. [19]), since it is essentially an\naccumulation of energy in some region of the inertial range. We, however, see\ntwo reasons-one specific to the context of superfluid turbulence and, most importantly, a generic fundamental one-why doing so could be misleading. The\nspecific reason is that the term has been already used in the context of the interface between hydrodynamic and Kelvin-wave modes, while fractalization of the\nlines is a purely Kelvin-wave effect, which happens deep (in the \u039b \u2192 \u221e limit)\nin the quantized regime. The fundamental reason is that the fractalization of the\nlines does not at all imply the absence of a channel(s) capable to accommodate\nthe energy flux-the fractalization starting at a given wavelength scale does not\nresult in any back action on larger scales, such as the development of a thermalized distribution above the bottleneck, which is a crucial ingredient of bottleneck\nscenarios. A more relevant term, putting the effect of vortex line fractalization in\na broader context of exotic cascade phenomena, might be the deposition of the\ncascading constant of motion (e.g., energy in our case) within the cascade inertial\nrange. While re-distributing the cascading quantity in a non-trivial way along the\ninertial range, the effect of deposition does not plug the cascade, thus leaving its\ngeneric properties intact.\n\nReferences\n1.
