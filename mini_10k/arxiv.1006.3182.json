Introduction\nIt is known that Painlev\u00e9 [1], Gullstrand [2] and (some years later) Lema\u0131\u0302tre [3] used a\nnon-orthogonal curvature coordinate system which allows to extend the Schwarzschild\nsolution inside its horizon, see Eq. (58) below. In this coordinate system, from now\non called a Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand (PG) coordinate system, the metric is not diagonal,\nbut asymptotically flat, and regular across the horizon, and then, everywhere nonsingular up to r = 0. Furthermore, one has a very simple spatial 3-geometry: the\nspace-time appears foliated by a synchronization of flat instants (hereafter called PG\nsynchronizations).\u2021\n\u2021 We use here the abbreviations 'PG coordinates' and 'PG synchronization' by sake of simplicity,\nwithout any intention of misplacing the relevant contribution by Lema\u0131\u0302tre [3], who clarified the\n\n\fPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronizations in spherical symmetry\n\n2\n\nNowadays, there is an increasing interest in the study of this type of\nsynchronizations. For instance: (i) in connection with astrophysical applications, by\ntaking into account that the dynamics of the gravitational collapse should be pursued\nbeyond the Schwarzschild radius in a PG coordinate system [6, 7, 8, 9], (ii) in spherically\nsymmetric space-times (SSSTs), as a convenient initial condition preserved under time\nevolution [10, 11], (iii) in relativistic hydrodynamics, when an effective Lorentzian metric\nis introduced [12], (iv) in non-relativistic situations admiting a Lorentzian description,\nnamely, in 'analog gravity models' (see, for example, [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]), and also\n(v) in modeling the black hole geometry and its associated physics, or to describe some\nquantum effects by starting from a Hamiltonian formulation [19, 20, 21, 22]. More\nphysical issues about the use of PG coordinates and their interpretation can be found\nin [4, 5, 23, 24]. For a description of the causal character of the geometric elements\n(coordinate lines, coordinate 2-surfaces and coordinate 3-surfaces) associated with PG\ncoordinates see [25, 26].\nThe existence of PG synchronizations in SSSTs has been studied in the static case\nconsidering that the induced metric has vanishing Ricci tensor [27], and some specific\nconstructions are presented in [28]. In more general cases, this existence is usually taken\nfor granted but, recently, a limitation to this ansatz has been pointed out [29]. However,\nas far as the authors are aware, a definitive interpretation of this limitation as well as\nthe analysis of the domains where a PG synchronization exists have not been done up to\nnow. Then, some related questions arise: does every SSST admits a region of physical\ninterest where a synchronization by flat instants exists? and, what are the advantages of\nadapting coordinates to a flat spatial 3-geometry? The main contribution of this paper\nis to state the above limitation clearly, in a form that it is coordinate independent, and\nto provide its physical interpretation.\nGeneralized (but, in general, non-flat) PG synchronizations have been constructed\nin Schwarzschild [30], Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m [29], and Kerr [31, 32] geometries, and also in\nnon-vacuum SSSTs, where new insights in the study of gravitational collapse scenarios\nare achieved (by evolving an initial 3-geometry [33, 34]). However, here we restrict\nourselves to flat synchronizations in order to discuss their existence in SSSTs.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to introduce some general\nformulae for the induced geometry on space-like hypersurfaces and surfaces in SSSTs. In\nSec. 3 the condition for the existence of a PG synchronization in SSSTs is analyzed and\nphysically interpreted. In Sec. 4 we write the components of the Weinberg pseudotensor\n[35] with respect to a PG synchronization, and we prove that the energy and momentum\ndensities of each PG slice vanish. In Sec. 5 we consider the semi-metric connection (see\n[36]) associated with a spherically symmetric metric expressed in PG coordinates and\nprovide new insights on the Newtonian interpretation of the properties exhibited by the\nSchwarzschild field in these coordinates. Sec. 6 deals with the 3 + 1 decomposition\ncoordinate character of the 'Schwarzschild singularity' obtaining an extended metric form for the\nSchwarzschild solution. In fact, the main motivation in papers [1, 2, 3] is rather different. For historical\nremarks about this subject, and some physical interpretations see [4, 5].\n\n\fPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronizations in spherical symmetry\n\n3\n\nof the Einstein equations with respect to a PG synchronization. By integration of the\nvacuum equations one recovers the extended Schwarzschild metric in PG coordinates,\nincluding the region inside the horizon. Finally, in Sec. 7 we discuss the role that\nour results can play for a better understanding of the geometry and physics in SSSTs.\nSome preliminary results of this work were presented at the Spanish Relativity meeting\nERE-2009 [37].\nLet us precise the used notation. The curvature tensor Rklij of a symmetric\nconnection \u2207 is defined according with the identity \u2207i \u2207j \u03be k \u2212 \u2207j \u2207i \u03be k = Rklij \u03be l for\nthe vector field \u03be, and Rij \u2261 Rkikj is the Ricci tensor. We take natural units in\nwhich c = G = 1 and the Einstein constant is \u03ba = 8\u03c0. We say that {t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6} is a\ncurvature coordinate system if for constant t and r the line element is dl2 = r 2 d\u03a92\n(with d\u03a92 \u2261 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 the metric of the unit sphere). In these coordinates, the\nmetric form is, in general, non-diagonal. When, in addition, the 3-surfaces defined\nby t = constant are flat, the curvature coordinate system is called a PG coordinate\nsystem. From now on, it will be understood that the title of the sections and the results\nof this work always concern space-times with spherical symmetry. The agreement for\nspace-time signature is (\u2212 + ++).\n2. Some geometrical relations\nIn this section we present the geometric background needed in the following sections:\nexpressions for the Ricci tensor and the extrinsic curvature of a spherically symmetric\nsynchronization, as well as, the mean curvature vector and the Gauss identity for the\n2-spheres of a SSST. Of course, this material is not new and it may be bypassed or used\nas a glossary of formulae, which are conveniently referred throughout the text of the\nremaining sections. For an account on 2+2 warped space-times properties allowing to\nintrinsically characterize SSST see [38, 39].\nLet (V4 , g) be a SSST, and let us consider a canonical coordinate system {T, R, \u03b8, \u03c6}\nof V4 , which is adapted to the symmetries of the metric g. Then we may express the\nmetric in the following general form [40, 41, 42]\ng = A dT \u2297 dT + B dR \u2297 dR + C(dT \u2297 dR + dR \u2297 dT ) + D \u03c3,\n\n(1)\n\nwith A(T, R), B(T, R), C(T, R) verifying the condition \u03b4 \u2261 AB \u2212 C 2 < 0, D(T, R) 6= 0,\nand \u03c3 \u2261 d\u03b8 \u2297 d\u03b8 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6 \u2297 d\u03c6 being the metric on the unit 2-sphere.\n2.1. Ricci tensor\nThe induced metric \u03b3 on the 3-surfaces T = constant, is written as\n\u03b3 = BdR \u2297 dR + D\u03c3,\nwith B 6= 0.

From Eqs. (3), (4) and (5), we see that \u03b3 is a flat metric if, and only if, F = 0,\nthat is\nRic(\u03b3) = 0\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n4BD = (\u2202R D)2 .\n\n(6)\n\n2.2. Extrinsic curvature\nThe extrinsic curvature of the slicing T = constant is defined as K = \u2212 21 Ln \u03b3 where Ln\nis the Lie derivative along the unit normal vector n,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n1\nC \u2202\n(7)\nn=\n\u2212\n\u03b1 \u2202T\nB \u2202R\n\u03b4\nwith \u03b12 = \u2212 . From (2), we obtain\nB\nK = \u03a8B dR \u2297 dR + \u03a6D \u03c3\n(8)\nwhere\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nC\n2\u2202R C \u2212 \u2202R B \u2212 \u2202T B\n\u03a8=\nB\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nC\n\u03b8\n\u03c6\n\u03a6 = K\u03b8 = K \u03c6 =\n\u2202R D \u2212 \u2202T D\n2D\u03b1 B\nKRR\n\n1\n=\n2B\u03b1\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nare the eigenvalues of K.

This is the result\nthat one could expect ought to the algebraic properties of the Cotton tensor and the assumed spherical\nsymmetry. This means that \u03b3 is a conformally flat metric.

Gauss identity\nGiven a space-like 2-surface \u03a3 of a space-time (V4 , g), the Gauss identity provides a scalar\nrelation involving the background geometry and the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of\n\u03a3, and it may be expressed ask\n2\nR(h) = R(g) + g(H, H) + 2tr(Kl \u00d7 Kk ) + 2Ric(l, k) \u2212 2W (l, k, l, k) (16)\n3\nwhere R(h) is the scalar curvature of the induced metric h on \u03a3, R(g), Ric and W are,\nrespectively, the scalar curvature, the Ricci and the Weyl tensor of g, and l and k are\ntwo independent future pointing null vectors normal to \u03a3 satisfying g(l, k) = \u22121. Now,\nH is the mean curvature of \u03a3, that is H = trK, with K the extrinsic curvature tensor\nof \u03a3 (as defined by the first equality of (13), taking ea and eb tangent to \u03a3); Kl and\nKk are, respectively, the second fundamental forms of \u03a3 relative to l and k, that is,\nKl (ea , eb ) = g(l, K(ea , eb )), and similarly for Kk . The trace is taken with respect to h,\nthat is, tr(Kl \u00d7 Kk ) = had hbc (Kl )ab (Kk )cd .\nk The Gauss identity is usually given in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (see, for instance\n[45, 46]) from which the expression (16) follows by taking into account the algebraic decomposition:\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = W\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 + g\u03b1[\u03b3 R\u03b4]\u03b2 \u2212 g\u03b2[\u03b3 R\u03b4]\u03b1 \u2212\n\nR\ng\u03b1[\u03b3 g\u03b4]\u03b2\n3\n\nwhere the bracket stands for antisymmetrization of index pairs, T[\u03b1\u03b2] \u2261 12 (T\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 T\u03b2\u03b1 ).\n\n\fPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronizations in spherical symmetry\n\n6\n\nFor \u03a3 = S, a 2-sphere (orbit) in a SSST, the Gauss identity may be written as\n1\n1\n(17)\n\u03c1 = 2\u03bb + (4\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) + H 2 .\n3\n2\nwith \u03c1 = 2/D the scalar curvature of D\u03c3, \u03bb the simple eigenvalue\u00b6 of W (provided that\nW 6= 0), and {\u03bc, \u03bc1, \u03bc2 } stand for the Ricci eigenvalues. More precisely, the tangent\nspace to S is the eigenplane associated with the eigenvalue \u03bc. The eigenvalues \u03bc1\nand \u03bc2 may be real (simple or multiple) or complex, and have associated the invariant\n2-plane tangent to S \u22a5 . Here, we have considered the algebraic classification of ChurchillPleba\u0144ski for a symmetric 2-tensor in Lorentzian geometry, and its peculiarities in\nspherical symmetry (see [48], and also [49] for an intrinsic approach). We have taken\ninto account that R(g) = 2\u03bc + \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 , and 2Ric(l, k) = \u2212(\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 ). In addition\nH 2 \u2261 g(H, H) = \u22124tr(Kl \u00d7 Kk ) because, according to (14), the second fundamental\nforms Kl and Kk are both proportional to h = D\u03c3.\n3. Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand slicings\nIn this section we find the condition ensuring the existence of a PG-synchronization in\nspherical symmetry, and we discuss its invariant meaning in terms of the eigenvalues\nof the Weyl and Ricci tensors. Also, using a radial curvature coordinate r, we provide\na physical interpretation of this condition in terms of the Misner-Sharp gravitational\nenergy of a 2-sphere of radius r. As commented below, this result shows an interesting\ninterconnection between the study and classification of trapped surfaces (see [50]) and\nthe existence of flat slicings.\n3.1. Existence condition\nLet us start from the general metric form (1). Exploring the gauge freedom to make\ncoordinate transformations of the form T = T (t, r), R = R(t, r), we look for a function\nt(T, R) whose level hypersurfaces t = constant are Euclidean, i. e., the induced metric\nis positive and flat. Under such a transformation, the metric (1) is expressed as\nds2 = \u03be 2 dt2 + \u03c72 dr 2 + 2\u03be * \u03c7 dt dr + D(t, r)d\u03a92 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwith D(t, r) \u2261 D(T (t, r), R(t, r)), and the vector fields \u03be and \u03c7 defined by\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u1e58\n,\n\u03c7 \u2261 T\u2032\n+ R\u2032\n.\n(19)\n\u03be \u2261 \u1e6a\n\u2202T\n\u2202R\n\u2202T\n\u2202R\nOver-dot and prime stand for partial derivative with respect t and r, respectively, and\nJ \u2261 \u1e6a R\u2032 \u2212 T \u2032 \u1e58 6= 0 assures coordinate regularity.\nThe scalar products \u03be 2 \u2261 g(\u03be, \u03be), \u03c72 \u2261 g(\u03c7, \u03c7) and \u03be * \u03c7 \u2261 g(\u03be, \u03c7) can be written as\n\u03b4(dD)2 \u1e6a 2 + 2\u1e0a Z \u1e6a + B \u1e0a 2 = (\u2202R D)2 \u03be 2 ,\n\n\u00b6 One has\n\n1\nW\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (l\u03b1 k \u03b2 \u2212 l\u03b2 k \u03b1 ) = \u03bb(l\u03bc k\u03bd \u2212 l\u03bd k\u03bc ),\n2\nand then, W (l, k, l, k) \u2261 W\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 l\u03bc k \u03bd l\u03b1 k \u03b2 = \u2212\u03bb.\n\n(20)\n\n\fPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronizations in spherical symmetry\n\n7\n\n\u03b4(dD)2 T \u20322 + 2D \u2032 Z T \u2032 + BD \u20322 = (\u2202R D)2 \u03c72 ,\n\n(21)\n\n(\u2202R D)2 \u03be * \u03c7 = \u03b4(dD)2 \u1e6a T \u2032 + Z (D \u2032\u1e6a + \u1e0aT \u2032 ) + B \u1e0aD \u2032 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we have used the relations \u1e0a = \u1e6a \u2202T D + \u1e58\u2202R D and D \u2032 = T \u2032 \u2202T D + R\u2032 \u2202R D to\nsubstitute \u1e58 and R\u2032 in terms of \u1e6a and T \u2032 . We have denoted Z \u2261 C\u2202R D \u2212 B\u2202T D. Then,\ndue to the Lorentzian character of the metric (\u03b4 < 0), Eqs. (20) and (21) lead to real\nvalues for \u1e6a and T \u2032 if, and only if, the inequalities\n\u03be 2 (dD)2 \u2264 \u1e0a 2 ,\n\n\u03c72 (dD)2 \u2264 D \u20322\n\n(23)\n\nare satisfied.

Consequently, in the case of a flat synchronization, the second\ninequality in (23) is equivalent to\n\u221a\n(d D)2 \u2264 1.\n(25)\nSo, under the assumed spherical symmetry, Eq. (25) provides the necessary and\nsufficient condition to be fulfilled for the existence of a flat slicing. The first inequality\nin (23) guarantees that the slices are space-like, that is, that the slicing is a PG\nsynchronization.\n3.2. Geometric interpretation\nIn terms of the scalar curvature \u03c1 = 2/D of the metric Dd\u03a92 , the above condition (25)\nmay be expressed as follows\n(d\u03c1)2 \u2264 2\u03c13 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhich involves the sole invariant \u03c1. On the other hand, according to Eq. (15),\nH 2 = \u03932 = (d ln D)2 , and then Eq.

Physical interpretation\nBy definition, see [41, 40], r is a coordinate of curvature for the spherically symmetric\nmetric form (18) if D(t, r) = r 2 , so that D \u2032 = 2r and \u1e0a = 0. Then, (25) says that\n(dr)2 \u2264 1, and taking into account that the Misner-Sharp gravitational energy E of a\n2-sphere of radius r is expressed as (see [51, 50])\n\u0011\nr\u0010\n(29)\n1 \u2212 (dr)2 ,\nE=\n2\nwe arrive to the following result.\nProposition 2 Any spherically symmetric space-time admits a Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand\nsynchronization in the region where the Misner-Sharp gravitational energy is nonnegative, E \u2265 0.\nThe Misner-Sharp energy has been painstakingly analyzed in [50], providing useful\ncriteria to study trapped surfaces. The main novelty here has been to relate this concept\nand the existence of PG synchronizations.+\nMoreover, the flatness condition (24) implies that \u03c72 = 1, and the metric (18) is\nwritten as\nds2 = \u03be 2 dt2 + 2\u03be * \u03c7 dt dr + dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 .\n\n(30)\n\nThen, accordingly to (20) and (22), the following relations must occur\nA(t, r) \u2261 \u03be 2 = J 2 \u03b4(dr)2\n\n(31)\n\np\nB(t, r) \u2261 \u03be * \u03c7 = \u03b5J \u03b4[(dr)2 \u2212 1]\n\nwhere \u03b5 = \u00b11. So, the real function B exists in the region where (dr)2 \u2264 1, and we have\nthe following result.\nProposition 3 Let r be the radius of curvature of the orbits (2-spheres) of the isometry\ngroup of a spherically symmetric space-time with metric g.

Given that the intrinsic and extrinsic scalar\ncurvatures of the 2-spheres are \u03c1 = 2/r 2 and H 2 = 4(d ln r)2 , and according with (29)\none has the invariant expression\n1 2\u0011\n1 \u0010\n(34)\n1\u2212 H .\nE=\u221a\n2\u03c1\n2\u03c1\n\nFinally, notice that Eq. (27) does not constraint the causal character of the mean\ncurvature vector H, which might be time-like, light-like or space-like. This is a\nremarkable property, because a 2-sphere is said to be trapped, marginal or untrapped if\nH is, respectively, time-like, light-like or space-like (see e. g. [45, 46, 50, 52]).\n4. Energy and momenta densities of a Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand slice\nIn this section we establish the following result.\n\nProposition 4 In any spherically symmetric space-time, the Weinberg energy and\nmomenta densities vanish for every Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronization.\nOf course, to find a coordinate system in which the Weinberg densities vanish is\nnot a surprising property, due to the non-tensorial character of them. However, the\nnovelty here is to show that, for every SSST, such a vanishing property occurs in PG\ncoordinates.\nIn order to proof the above result, let us consider the metric (33) written in a\nquasi-Minkowskian form, that is g = \u03b7 + h with \u03b7 the Minkowski metric, h00 = 1 + A,\nh0i = Bxi /r, and hij = 0.\nWe start from the expression of the Weinberg pseudo-tensor [35],\n\u2202h\u03bc\u03bc i\u03bb \u2202h\u03bc\u03bc 0\u03bb \u2202h\u03bc0 i\u03bb \u2202h\u03bci 0\u03bb \u2202h0\u03bb \u2202hi\u03bb\n\u03b7 \u2212\n\u03b7 \u2212\n\u03b7 +\n\u03b7 +\n\u2212\n,\n\u2202x0\n\u2202xi\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\u2202xi\n\u2202x0\nwhere Latin and Greek indexes go from 1 to 3 and from 0 to 3, respectively, and all\nindexes are raised and lowered with the flat metric \u03b7.

Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand slicings and semi-metric connections\nIn the eighties, Bel proposed an extended Newtonian theory of gravitation based on\na semi-metric connection associated with an observer congruence and a flat spatial\n3-metric [36]. In a space-time, with metric g\u03bc\u03bd , which admits a spatially flat slicing\ngiven by the coordinate hypersurfaces x0 = constant, the connection coefficients of the\naforementioned semi-metric connection are written as [36],\n1\n(37)\n\u039bk = \u2212 \u0393k00 = \u03b4 ki (\u2202i g00 \u2212 2\u22020 g0i )\n2\n\u03a9kj = \u2212 2\u0393k0j = \u03b4 ki (\u2202i g0j \u2212 2\u2202j g0i ).\n(38)\nConsequently, a SSST metric admits a Newtonian interpretation when it is written\nin PG coordinates and it is considered in the above context.

(47), (48), (49) and (50) are the 3 + 1 splitting of the Einstein\nequations with respect to a vorticity free observer. The proper space of such an observer\nis Euclidean if, and only if, F = 0, and then R = 0. The integration of these\nequations for simple energetic contents (for instance, a dust model) should provide the\ncorresponding metric form in PG coordinates. In the next section, the vacuum case is\nconsidered: the extended form of Schwarzschild solution in PG coordinates is obtained\nfrom the sole consideration of the field equations.\n6.2. Schwarzschild vacuum solution\nThe extended Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand-Lema\u0131\u0302tre metric form of the Schwarzschild solution\nmay be obtained assuming spherical symmetry and the existence of a flat\nsynchronization, Ric(\u03b3) = 0, and then, solving the vacuum Einstein equations in a\ncoordinate system adapted to such a synchronization. So, let us take \u03c4 = p = \u03a0RR =\n\u03a0\u03b8\u03b8 = F = R = 0. Then, for the metric expression (33), the lapse function is given by\n\u03b12 = B2 \u2212 A and the constraint equations (47) and (48) result\n\u03a6(\u03a6 + 2\u03a8) = 0\n\n(51)\n\nr\u03a6\u2032 + \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8 = 0\n\n(52)\n\nwith\nB\u2032\n1B\n,\n\u03a8=\n.\n(53)\n\u03b1r\n\u03b1\nWhen \u03a6 = 0, taking into account also the evolution equations, we recover the\nMinkowski space-time. In the generic case, \u03a6 = \u22122\u03a8 6= 0, Eq. (53) leads to\n\u03a6=\n\nB = f (t)r \u22121/2\n\n(54)\n\nwith f (t) an arbitrary function. Substituting Eq. (54) in the momentum constraint\n(52), it reduces to \u03b1\u2032 = 0. Consequently, the lapse is a function of the sole variable t,\n\u03b1(t), and we can take \u03b1 = 1 by re-scaling the coordinate t. Then, we have\n\u03a6 = f (t)r \u22123/2 = \u22122\u03a8.\n\n(55)\n\n\fPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronizations in spherical symmetry\n\n13\n\nNext, the evolution equations (49) and (50) are written as\n\u03a8\u0307 = \u03a8(2\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8) +\n\n1 2 \u2032\n(B \u03a8)\nB\n\nB 2 \u2032\n(r \u03a6) .\nr2\nGiven that \u03a6 = \u22122\u03a8, these last equations are equivalent to\nB\n\u03a8\u0307 = \u03a82 + 2 (r 2 \u03a8)\u2032\nr\n\u03a6\u0307 = \u03a8\u03a6 +\n\n3\u03a8 +\n\n(56)\n\nB\n\u2212 B\u2032 = 0.\nr\n\n(57)\n\nBy using the expressions (54) and (55), the equation (56) leads to f (t) = constant and\n\u221a\nthe equation (57) is identically satisfied. Finally, by taking f = \u01eb 2m, we obtain\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2m\n2m\ndt2 + 2\u01eb\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212\ndt dr + dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 ,\n(58)\nr\nr\n\nwhich is the extended form of the Schwarzschild solution obtained by Painlev\u00e9,\nGullstrand and Lema\u0131\u0302tre [1, 2, 3]. The positive parameter m is the Schwarzschild\nenergy. The sign \u01eb provides two coordinate branches for the solution, the KruskalSzekeres black and white hole regions being described by the above metric with \u01eb = 1\nand \u01eb = \u22121, respectively, see [21]. Note that the r coordinate can take any positive\n< 1, and the\nvalue, 0 < r < +\u221e. In fact, from (58), we have (dr)2 = g rr = 1 \u2212 2m\nr\ndomain of a Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand chart extends for every value of r 6= 0. Notice that\n(29) implies that E = m, which provides the physical interpretation\nof the parameter\nq\nm as an effective energy [50]. Moreover, writing dt = dtS + \u01eb\nrecovers the usual Schwarzschild metric form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2m\n2m\n2\n2\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212\ndtS + 1 \u2212\ndr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92\nr\nr\n\n2m\n(1\nr\n\n\u2212\n\n2m \u22121\n) dr,\nr\n\none\n\n(59)\n\nwhere tS is the coordinate time of the static observer (\u2212\u221e < tS < \u221e) and the rank of the\nr coordinate is restricted to be r > 2m. According to the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem (see\n[57] an references therein), we recover the Schwarzschild metric as the sole spherically\nsymmetric solution of the vacuum Einstein equations.\nOther derivations of the Schwarzschild solution providing improvements of the\noriginal proof of the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem have been achieved by solving the\nfield equations in null coordinates (see [50, 58] and reference therein). From the\nconceptual point of view, any of these derivations make unnecessary to get a coordinate\ntransformation allowing to extend the domain of Schwarzschild chart from the outer to\nthe inner horizon regions.\n\n\fPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand synchronizations in spherical symmetry\n\n14\n\n7. Discussion\nIn this work we have analyzed the existence of flat synchronizations in SSSTs. The\ncondition (27) provides an upper bound for the norm of the mean extrinsic curvature\nvector of the isometry group orbits which, using the Gauss identity, may be expressed\nin terms of curvature invariants. Moreover, the associated flat slices have vanishing\nWeinberg energy and momentum densities. We have seen that any spherically symmetric\nmetric admits a Newtonian interpretation in the context of the Bel extended Newtonian\ntheory of gravitation. Our study offers a new perspective about the meaning of the\nPainlev\u00e9-Gullstrand coordinates. This study applies for any SSST in the region where\nthese coordinates exist. In this region, the gradient of the radial Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand\ncoordinate r may be space-like, light-like, or time-like, according to the condition\n(dr)2 \u2264 1, which means that the Misner-Sharp gravitational energy of a sphere of radius\nr is non-negative. This condition may be tested for any SSST, starting from the general\nmetric form (1). For instance, it occurs elsewhere in the Schwarzschild geometry, as it\nhas been pointed out at the end of Sec. 6. Moreover, one has that (dr)2 \u2264 1 everywhere\nfor any Robertson-Walker metric with an energetic content which satisfies the usual\nenergy conditions. In fact, if we put in (1) A = \u22121, B = a2 (t)/(1 + k4 r 2 )2 (with\nk = 1, 0, \u22121 the universe curvature index), C = 0 and D = r 2 B, we obtain that, in this\ncase, (27) is equivalent to k + \u02272 \u2265 0, which means that the proper energy density of\nthe cosmological fluid is non negative. Consequently, any Robertson-Walker space-time\nthat satisfies this energy condition admits a PG synchronization. This property is also\nobtained directly from the inequality (28). In this case, \u03c4 = \u2212e1 and p = e2 = e are,\nrespectively, the energy density and the pressure of the cosmological fluid, and \u03bb = 0,\nbecause the Robertson-Walker metric is conformally flat. We leave for a future work\nthe obtaining of the Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand form of these Robertson-Walker cosmological\nmodels.\nFinally, we have presented an improved proof of the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem by\nexpressing and solving the vacuum Einstein Equations in PG-coordinates. So, the\nextended Painlev\u00e9-Gullstrand-Lema\u0131\u0302tre metric form of the Schwarzschild solution is\ndirectly obtained.\nAcknowledgments\nWe appreciate valuable aids provided by the tandem Joan J.
