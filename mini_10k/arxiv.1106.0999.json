Introduction\nThe Schwarzschild solution in four spacetime dimensions represents perhaps the simplest black hole at all, but it is nevertheless very difficult to understand its microstates.\nThis is in sharp contrast to some black holes in string theory, that (though being rather\ncomplicated) can be understood in terms of bound states of D-branes and strings, which\nmakes it possible to compute their entropy microscopically [1].\nA general feature that has emerged is that essentially all black holes whose entropy\nwas reproduced by a microstate counting, are described by two-dimensional conformal\nfield theories. Two of the most prominent examples of this type are the BTZ solution [2]\nor the extremal Kerr black hole [3].\nThis universal conformal structure inherent to the physics of many black holes has\ntriggered numerous attempts to unveil such a conformal (albeit not necessarily twodimensional) symmetry also in the Schwarzschild case. For instance, [4, 5] considered\ndiffeomorphisms preserving the black hole horizon, and showed that the charges associated to these diffeomorphisms generate a centrally extended Virasoro algebra. A\ndifferent approach was adopted in [6], where it was shown that the optical metric of\nthe Schwarzschild solution becomes R \u00d7 H3 near the horizon. Since H3 is Euclidean\nAdS3 , this allows to apply techniques originating from the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fAn interesting related development can be found in [7], where it was argued that the\nsymmetry algebra of asymptotically flat spacetimes at null infinity in four dimensions\nshould be taken to be the semi-direct sum of supertranslations with infinitesimal local\nconformal transformations and not, as usually done, with the Lorentz algebra.\nOn the other hand, it was discovered recently [8] that the scalar wave equation in\nthe nonextremal Kerr black hole enjoys, in the low frequency limit, a hidden conformal\nsymmetry that is not derived from an underlying symmetry of the spacetime itself. The\nexistence of such a hidden symmetry is related to the fact that black hole scattering\namplitudes are given in terms of hypergeometric functions [9], which are well-known to\nform representations of the conformal group SL(2, R). Together with evidence provided\nby the results of [3], this led to the conjecture that the nonextremal Kerr black hole\nwith angular momentum J is dual to a two-dimensional CFT with central charges cL =\ncR = 12J [8]. Indeed, using cL and cR in the Cardy formula for a CFT2 gives exactly\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the Kerr solution. Moreover, the low frequency\nscalar-Kerr scattering amplitudes coincide with thermal correlators of a 2d CFT [8]1 .\nIn view of these results, one may ask whether an analogous hidden symmetry exists\nin the Schwarzschild case as well. Note in this context that one cannot simply take the\nzero rotation limit (a \u2192 0) in the generators of the hidden SL(2, R)\u00d7SL(2, R) symmetry\nfor Kerr, since this limit is singular. For instance, the left- and right-temperatures of\nthe dual CFT,\n\u221a\nM2\nM4 \u2212 J2\nTL =\n,\nTR =\n,\n(1.1)\n2\u03c0J\n2\u03c0J\nthat appear in these generators, clearly diverge for J \u2192 0. We shall find that the\nmassless Klein-Gordon equation in the Schwarzschild background does indeed enjoy\nsuch a symmetry, but with two essential differences to the Kerr case: First, there\nis only one SL(2, R) factor present for the Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, the\ngenerators are globally defined, whereas for Kerr they are not periodic under the angular\nidentification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0, which breaks SL(2, R)L \u00d7 SL(2, R)R down to U(1)L \u00d7 U(1)R .\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we describe the\nhidden SL(2, R) symmetry appearing in the scalar wave equation at low frequencies.\nIn the following section, we use the fact that the four-dimensional stationary EinsteinMaxwell equations are invariant under an SU(2, 1) group of transformations [11, 12]\nto map the Schwarzschild solution into the near-horizon limit AdS2 \u00d7 S2 of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. We show that this transformation preserves\nthe entropy, and makes the hidden SL(2, R) symmetry manifest, since its generators\nbecome exactly the isometries of the AdS2 factor. After that, in section 4, the SL(2, R)\n1\n\nFor the near-extremal Kerr black hole, this was first noted in [10].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fsymmetry is used to algebraically determine the Schwarzschild quasinormal modes as\ndescendents of a lowest weight state. Although this takes us out of the validity of our\nlow (and real) frequency approximation, it surprisingly yields the correct leading behaviour of the quasinormal frequencies for large damping. We conclude in 5 with some\nfinal remarks. In appendix A it is shown that the hidden SL(2, R) symmetry extends\nto the Schwarzschild black hole in any dimension.\n\n2. Hidden conformal symmetry\nLet us consider the massless Klein-Gordon equation\n\u221a\n1\n\u221a \u2202\u03bc ( \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a6) = 0\n\u2212g\n\n(2.1)\n\nin the Schwarzschild geometry,\nds2 = \u2212V (r)dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\nV (r)\n\nV (r) = 1 \u2212\n\n2M\n.\nr\n\n(2.2)\n\nUsing the separation ansatz\n\u03a6(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = e\u2212i\u03c9t R(r)Yml (\u03b8, \u03c6) ,\n\n(2.3)\n\ntogether with\n\u2206S 2 Yml (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n1\n1\n2 l\nl\n\u2202\u03b8 (sin \u03b8\u2202\u03b8 Yml (\u03b8, \u03c6)) +\n2 \u2202\u03c6 Ym (\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u2212l(l + 1)Ym (\u03b8, \u03c6) ,\nsin \u03b8\nsin \u03b8\n\n(2.1) reduces to\n\u03c9 2r4\n\u2202r \u2206\u2202r R +\nR \u2212 l(l + 1)R = 0 ,\n\u2206\nwhere we defined \u2206 = r 2 \u2212 2Mr \u2261 r(r \u2212 r+ ). Now use\n\n(2.4)\n\n3\n4\n\u03c9 2 r+\n\u03c9 2 r+\n\u03c9 2r4\n2\n= \u03c9 2r 2 + \u03c9 2rr+ + \u03c9 2 r+\n+\n+\n.\n\u2206\nr\n\u2206\n\nThe first four terms on the rhs are much smaller than 1 in the near-region, low frequency\nlimit \u03c9r \u226a 1, \u03c9r+ \u226a 1, whereas the last term blows up if one goes sufficiently close\n4\nto the horizon. We shall thus approximate2 the expression \u03c9 2 r 4 /\u2206 by \u03c9 2r+\n/\u2206. Then\n(2.4) becomes\n4\n\u03c9 2 r+\nR \u2212 l(l + 1)R = 0 .\n(2.5)\n\u2202r \u2206\u2202r R +\n\u2206\n2\n\nNote that this approximation is exactly the same as the one in eqns. (2.11), (2.12) of [13] (set\na = Q = 0 there). The authors of [13] have r \u2212 r+ \u226a 1/\u03c9 as near-region condition, which is implied\nby \u03c9r \u226a 1, \u03c9r+ \u226a 1 and r > r+ .\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fNext, we define the vector fields\n\u0001\nt\nH1 = ie 4M \u22061/2 \u2202r \u2212 4M(r \u2212 M)\u2206\u22121/2 \u2202t ,\nH0 = \u22124iM\u2202t ,\nt\n\u2212 4M\n\nH\u22121 = \u2212ie\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u22061/2 \u2202r + 4M(r \u2212 M)\u2206\u22121/2 \u2202t ,\n\nwhich obey the SL(2, R) commutation relations\n[H0 , H\u00b11 ] = \u2213iH\u00b11 ,\n\n\u0001\n\n[H1 , H\u22121 ] = 2iH0 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe SL(2, R) Casimir reads\n1\nH2 = \u2212H02 + (H1 H\u22121 + H\u22121 H1 )\n2\n16M 4 2\n\u2202 ,\n= \u2206\u2202r2 + 2(r \u2212 M)\u2202r \u2212\n\u2206 t\n\n(2.8)\n\nand thus the near-region Klein-Gordon equation can be rewritten as\nH2 \u03a6 = l(l + 1)\u03a6 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nWe see that the scalar wave equation in the Schwarzschild geometry enjoys a hidden\nconformal symmetry similar to the Kerr case, but with two essential differences: First,\nfor the Kerr black hole, there is an SL(2, R)L \u00d7 SL(2, R)R symmetry, whereas here only\none SL(2, R) factor is present. This indicates that the Schwarzschild black hole might\nbe described by a chiral CFT. Secondly, the vector fields (2.6) are globally defined,\nwhile the ones in [8] are not periodic under the angular identification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0.\nThis fact was interpreted in [8] as a spontaneous breaking of the SL(2, R)L \u00d7 SL(2, R)R\nsymmetry down to U(1)L \u00d7 U(1)R by left and right temperatures TL and TR .\nNotice also that the existence of a hidden SL(2, R) symmetry stems from the fact\nthat the solution of (2.4) is given in terms of Heun functions, which can be expanded in\na series of hypergeometric functions (cf. e.g. [14]), and the latter form representations\nof the conformal group. (One can show that this series can be truncated to the leading\nterm in a low energy limit, cf. [15] for a review of such an expansion for the Kerr black\nhole).\nThe condition (2.9) implies that the field \u03a6 has conformal weight h = l + 1 [15].\nTo see this, define Ln = \u2212iHn , n = 0, \u00b11, such that\n[Ln , Lm ] = (n \u2212 m)Ln+m .\n\n(2.10)\n\nThen the second Casimir is\nH2 = L20 \u2212\n\n1\n(L1 L\u22121 + L\u22121 L1 ) = h(h \u2212 1) ,\n2\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(2.11)\n\n\fwhich implies h(h \u2212 1) = l(l + 1), whose positive solution is h = l + 1.\nNote that a similar conformal structure was discovered before in [16] and further\nexplored in [17, 18]: If we set R = \u03c7/\u22061/2 , the radial equation (2.4) reduces to\n\u2202r2 \u03c7 +\n\nM 2 + \u03c9 2r4\nl(l + 1)\n\u03c7\u2212\n\u03c7=0.\n2\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\n(2.12)\n\nDefining x = r \u2212 r+ and expanding the potential near the horizon x = 0, this boils\ndown to\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng\nd2\n\u22121\n(2.13)\n\u2212 2 \u2212 2 + O(x ) \u03c7 = 0 ,\ndx\n4x\n\nwhere g = 1 + (4M\u03c9)2 .

In this case, the conformal symmetry is hidden, i.e., it is not\ninherited from a near-horizon geometry that has this symmetry.\n\n3. Kinnersley transformations and relation to AdS2 \u00d7 S2\nIt is well-known that the four-dimensional stationary Einstein-Maxwell equations are\ninvariant under an SU(2, 1) group of transformations [11, 12]. In this section, we shall\nuse this group to map the Schwarzschild solution to the AdS2 \u00d7 S2 Bertotti-Robinson\nspacetime, and show that the hidden symmetry generators (2.6) go over into the AdS2\nisometries under this mapping.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fWe first review briefly how the SU(2, 1) acts on the solution space of the stationary\nEinstein-Maxwell equations. Any spacetime admitting a timelike Killing vector can be\nwritten as3\nds2 = f (dt \u2212 \u03c9i dxi )2 \u2212 f \u22121 hij dxi dxj ,\n(3.1)\nwhere the scalar f , the one-form \u03c9i and the three-metric hij depend on the spatial\ncoordinates xi only. The electromagnetic field F\u03bc\u03bd can be parametrized in terms of\nelectric and magnetic potentials u and v,\nFi0 = \u2202i v ,\n\nF ij = f h\u22121/2 \u01ebijk \u2202k u .\n\n(3.2)\n\nMoreover, one defines the twist or nut-potential \u03c7 by\n\u2202i \u03c7 = \u2212f 2 h\u22121/2 hij \u01ebjkl \u2202k \u03c9l + 2(u\u2202i v \u2212 v\u2202i u) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand combines the four real scalars f, \u03c7, u, v to the complex Ernst potentials according\nto\nE = f + i\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 ,\n\u03c8 = v + iu .\n(3.4)\nThen the stationary Einstein-Maxwell equations boil down to [11, 21]\n\u0001\nf \u22072 E = \u2207E * \u2207E + 2\u03c8\u0304\u2207\u03c8 ,\n\u0001\nf \u22072 \u03c8 = \u2207\u03c8 * \u2207E + 2\u03c8\u0304\u2207\u03c8 ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n2\n \u0304\nf Rij (h) = Re E,(i E, j) + 2\u03c8E,(i \u03c8\u0304, j) \u2212 2E\u03c8,(i \u03c8\u0304, j) ,\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere the scalar products and the Laplacian are computed with the metric hij . The\nequations (3.5) are invariant under an SU(2, 1) group of transformations [11,12], acting\nas follows: Parametrize the Ernst potentials in terms of the three Kinnersley potentials\nU, V, W (one of which is redundant) by [12]\nE=\n\nU \u2212W\n,\nU +W\n\n\u03c8=\n\nV\n.\nU +W\n\n(3.6)\n\nThen, the SU(2, 1) acts linearly on the complex vector (U, V, W ), and transforms solutions of (3.5) with spatial metric hij into new solutions with the same hij . Note that\nthe SU(2, 1) invariance is just a consequence of the fact that the timelike Kaluza-Klein\nreduction of the 4d Einstein-Maxwell action yields three-dimensional gravity coupled to\n3\n\nIn order to conform to some of the older literature on this subject, in this section (and only here)\nwe use mostly minus signature.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fan SU(2, 1)/S(U(1, 1) \u00d7 U(1)) nonlinear sigma model, which describes the four scalars\nf, \u03c7, u, v [22]4 .\nIn order to apply this to the Schwarzschild solution, rewrite the latter as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = f dt2 \u2212 f \u22121 M 2 dx2 + (x2 \u2212 1)(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\n\nf=\n\nx\u22121\n,\nx+1\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere the new coordinate x is given by x = r/M \u2212 1, such that the horizon is at x = 1.\nAs Ernst potentials we may thus take U = x, V = 0, W = 1. We now apply a boost in\nthe (V, W ) subspace, followed by an involution in U, V ,\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\u0013 \u0012\nV\nV\ncosh \u03b1 sinh \u03b1\n,\nU\u2032 = U ,\n(3.8)\n=\n\u2032\nW\nsinh \u03b1 cosh \u03b1\nW\nU \u2032\u2032 = V \u2032 ,\n\nV \u2032\u2032 = U \u2032 ,\n\nW \u2032\u2032 = W \u2032 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich leads to the new metric5\n2\n\nds\u2032\u2032 = e\u22122\u03b1 (x2 \u2212 1)dt2 \u2212\n\ne2\u03b1 M 2 dx2\n\u2212 e2\u03b1 M 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\nx2 \u2212 1\n\n(3.10)\n\nF \u2032\u2032 = e\u2212\u03b1 dx \u2227 dt .\n\n(3.11)\n\nand gauge field\n(3.10) is the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime AdS2 \u00d7 S2 , with the AdS2 seen by an accelerated observer, and x = 1 the acceleration horizon. It represents the near-horizon\ngeometry of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole, with entropy\nS=\n\nAhor\ne2\u03b1 \u03c0M 2\n=\n.\n4G\nG\n\n(3.12)\n\nApparently, this is different from the entropy 4\u03c0M 2 /G of the Schwarzschild black hole\nwe started with, unless e\u03b1 = 2. However, there is a subtlety here: Consider the timelike\nKaluza-Klein reduction from four to three dimensions, using the ansatz (3.1), and\nWick-rotate t = \u2212i\u03c4 , with \u03c4 \u223c \u03c4 + \u03b2, where \u03b2 denotes the inverse temperature. This\nyields an effective three-dimensional Newton constant G3 = G4 /\u03b2. If the Kinnersley\ntransformation maps a solution with Euclidean time period \u03b2 into one with \u03b2\u0302, we have\nobviously\n1\n\u03b2\u0302\n\u03b2\n.\n(3.13)\n=\n=\nG3\nG4\n\u011c4\n4\n\nThis extends also to generalizations of the Einstein-Maxwell action which typically arise from\nKaluza-Klein theories. In that case one gets more complicated G/H nonlinear sigma models [22].\n5\nNotice that the boost (3.8) alone maps the Schwarzschild into the nonextremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nsolution, cf. e.g. [23].\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fThe entropy of the new solution is thus\n\u015c =\n\n\u00c2hor\n4\u011c4\n\n=\n\n\u00c2hor \u03b2\n4G4 \u03b2\u0302\n\n.\n\n(3.14)\n\nIn our case, the inverse temperature associated to the horizon at x = 1 of (3.10) is easily\nseen to be \u03b2\u0302 = 2\u03c0Me2\u03b1 , whereas \u03b2 = 8\u03c0M for Schwarzschild. Since \u00c2hor = e2\u03b1 Ahor /4,\n(3.14) gives \u015c = S, so that the entropy is actually invariant, no matter what the value\nof the boost parameter \u03b1 is. We are not aware of any general proof that Kinnersley\ntransformations leave the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy invariant, as it happens e.g. for\nT-duality in string theory [24] (it is not even evident that they map black holes into\nsolutions that have again a horizon), but in our special case they obviously do. Notice\nthat the value e\u03b1 = 2 is nevertheless special, in that the temperature of (3.10) coincides\nexactly with the temperature of the Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, the SL(2, R)\ngenerators (2.6), which in the coordinate x read\n\u0001\nt\nH1 = ie 4M (x2 \u2212 1)1/2 \u2202x \u2212 4Mx(x2 \u2212 1)\u22121/2 \u2202t ,\n\nH0 = \u22124iM\u2202t ,\nt\n\u2212 4M\n\nH\u22121 = \u2212ie\n\n(3.15)\n\n(x2 \u2212 1)1/2 \u2202x + 4Mx(x2 \u2212 1)\u22121/2 \u2202t ,\n\u0001\n\nare exactly the Killing vectors of the AdS2 factor in (3.10) for e\u03b1 = 2. (For other values\nof the boost parameter, one has to rescale time in order to have this identification).\nAlso, the near-region, low frequency Klein-Gordon equation (2.9) becomes precisely the\nKG equation on AdS2 \u00d7 S2 .\n\n4. Quasinormal modes\nQuasinormal modes [25] are defined to be perturbations of the black hole whose boundary conditions are purely outgoing both at the horizon and at infinity. These boundary\nconditions single out discrete complex frequencies \u03c9n . It has been argued [26] that the\nasymptotic (large n) behaviour of the high overtone black hole quasinormal frequencies\ncaptures important information about the spectrum of black hole observables; in particular that the asymptotic value of Re \u03c9n is related to the so-called Barbero-Immirzi\nparameter of loop quantum gravity.\nIn general, the \u03c9n have to be determined numerically, for instance by using continued fraction techniques. In this way, Nollert [27] obtained\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\ni\nn+\n+ O (n + 1)\u22121/2\n(4.1)\nM\u03c9n = 0.0437123 \u2212\n4\n2\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\ffor the scalar quasinormal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole. It was first realized\nby Hod [28] that the numerical value 0.0437123 agrees (up to the available precision)\nwith ln 3/(8\u03c0), a number required by statistical physics arguments and Bohr's correspondence principle. Later it was shown in [29, 30] that the asymptotic real part of \u03c9n\nis indeed precisely ln 3/(8\u03c0).\nThe authors of [31] realized that in black hole spacetimes with hidden conformal\nsymmetry, one can use the latter to algebraically determine the quasinormal mode\nspectrum as descendents of a lowest weight state. Looking at (4.1), we see that for\nlarge n the imaginary part of \u03c9n is equally spaced6 , so one might ask whether this can\nbe realized as an SL(2, R) tower. Apparently the limit of large Im \u03c9n takes us out of\nthe validity of our approximation. (In order to reduce the Klein-Gordon operator to\nan SL(2, R) Casimir we used \u03c9 real and \u03c9M \u226a 1). One might nevertheless ask how far\nthe applicability of the SL(2, R) symmetry can be pushed, and see which quasinormal\nmodes result by acting with L\u22121 on a lowest weight state. We shall see that this\nreproduces correctly the leading large n behaviour of (4.1).\nLet us denote the lowest weight state by \u03a6(0) . By definition\nL0 \u03a6(0) = h\u03a6(0) ,\n\nL1 \u03a6(0) = 0 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere Lm = \u2212iHm . Since\n\u03a6(0) = e\u2212i\u03c90 t R(0) (r)Yml (\u03b8, \u03c6) ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwe have h = 4iM\u03c90 . Using (4.2) together with L1 L\u22121 = 2L0 + L\u22121 L1 in (2.9), one gets\nh=\n\n1\n(1 \u00b1 (2l + 1)) ,\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\nand thus\n\ni\nM\u03c90 = \u2212 (1 \u00b1 (2l + 1)) .\n(4.5)\n8\nSince quasinormal modes have Im \u03c9n < 0 we must choose the upper sign, such that\nM\u03c90 = \u2212i(l + 1)/4 and h = l + 1, in agreement with the conformal weight assignment\nin section 2. One can now construct the descendents\n\u03a6(n) = (L\u22121 )n \u03a6(0) .\n\n(4.6)\n\nTaking into account (4.3) as well as L\u22121 = \u2212iH\u22121 , with the expression for H\u22121 given\nin eqns. (2.6), it is not difficult to shew that\n\u03a6(n) = e\u2212i\u03c9n t R(n) (r)Yml (\u03b8, \u03c6) ,\n6\n\n(4.7)\n\nNote that the spacing 2\u03c0iTHawking in (4.1) is not too surprising, since the quasinormal modes\ndetermine the position of poles of a Green's function, and the black hole has Euclidean time \u03c4 \u223c\n\u03c4 + 1/THawking [30].\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fwhere\n\ni\nM\u03c9n = M\u03c90 \u2212 n ,\n4\n\n(4.8)\n\nand\nR(n) (r) =\n\n\u2212\u22061/2 \u2202r + 4M(r \u2212 M)\u2206\u22121/2 i\u03c9n\u22121\n\n\u0001\n\u2212\u22061/2 \u2202r + 4M(r \u2212 M)\u2206\u22121/2 i\u03c9n\u22122 *\n\u0001\n. . . * \u2212\u22061/2 \u2202r + 4M(r \u2212 M)\u2206\u22121/2 i\u03c90 R(0) (r) .\n(4.9)\n\u0001\n\nNotice that (4.8) implies\n\nL0 \u03a6(n) = (h + n)\u03a6(n) ,\n\nn = 0, 1, . . . ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nand thus the quasinormal modes \u03a6(n) form a principal discrete lowest weight representation of SL(2, R).\nComparing (4.8) with (4.1), we see that the leading behaviour \u223c \u2212in/4 for large\ndamping comes out correctly, while the subleading terms do not. In particular, the\nfrequencies (4.8) are purely imaginary.\nLet us finally check if the \u03a6(n) satisfy purely outgoing boundary conditions at the\nhorizon, as it must be for quasinormal modes. We have to show that\nR(n) \u223c e\u2212i\u03c9n r\u22c6\n\nas r\u22c6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere r\u22c6 is the tortoise coordinate\n\nFirst of all, L1 \u03a6(0) = 0 yields\n\n\u0010 r\n\u0011\nr\u22c6 = r + 2M ln\n\u22121 .\n2M\n\n(4.12)\n\nR(0) = C(r 2 \u2212 2Mr)\u22122iM \u03c90 ,\n\n(4.13)\n\nwith C an integration constant. This is easily seen to behave as\n\u0001\nR(0) \u223c e\u2212i\u03c90 r\u22c6 1 + O(er\u22c6 /(2M ) )\n\nas r\u22c6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Let us show (4.11) by induction. To this end, assume that\n\u0001\nas r\u22c6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e ,\nR(n\u22121) \u223c e\u2212i\u03c9n\u22121 r\u22c6 1 + O(er\u22c6 /(2M ) )\n\n(4.14)\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhich clearly holds for n = 1. Acting on (4.15) with the operator (\u2212\u22061/2 \u2202r + 4M(r \u2212\nM)\u2206\u22121/2 i\u03c9n\u22121 ), one finds that (4.15) holds also with n \u2212 1 replaced by n, which proves\n(4.11). Note that the functions R(n) (r) do not satisfy outgoing boundary conditions at\ninfinity, but this was to be expected, since they are solutions only in some near region,\nand have to be matched somewhere with a far region solution.\nIn view of the results of this section, it would be very interesting to see if one\ncan set up a perturbation expansion organized in terms of the SL(2, R) that gives the\nfrequencies (4.1). Work in this direction is in progress.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f5. Final remarks\nOur results indicate that the Schwarzschild black hole might have a description in terms\nof a two-dimensional CFT. If this is the case, the SL(2, R) (2.7) should be enlarged to\nthe whole Virasoro algebra, which raises the question if the corresponding generators\nare related to those of [4,5], that generate diffeomorphisms preserving certain boundary\nconditions at the black hole horizon. In this context, it is interesting to consider the\ntransformation from Schwarzschild to Kruskal coordinates U, V , given by\nV = ev/4M ,\n\nU = \u2212e\u2212u/4M ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere u = t \u2212 r\u22c6 , v = t + r\u22c6 , and r\u22c6 denotes the tortoise coordinate defined in (4.12). In\nthe Euclidean section we have t = \u2212i\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is identified modulo \u03b2 = 1/T = 8\u03c0M.\nDefining w = r\u22c6 + i\u03c4 and z = \u2212U, (5.1) becomes\nw\n\nz = e 4M .\n\n(5.2)\n\nThis is exactly the conformal transformation from a cylinder (w) to a plane (z), namely\nz = exp(2\u03c0w/L), if the circumference L of the cylinder is identified with the inverse\ntemperature \u03b2. It is well-known that such a transformation induces a shift of c/24 in\nthe Virasoro generators L0 , L\u03030 . If we knew how to define the stress tensor of the dual\nCFT (in a way similar to that of the AdS/CFT correspondence [32]), this would allow\nto compute the central charge c.\nNotice also that the Schwarzschild solution is related by the duality-type transformation of section 3 to the near horizon limit AdS2 \u00d7 S2 of the extremal ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole, and the latter is known to be described by a CFT2 [33]. It\nwould be interesting to see what the Kerr solution maps to under this SU(2, 1) transformation, and if (part of) the hidden conformal SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) symmetry of [8]\nbecomes manifest in this way.\nAn open question (also in Kerr/CFT) is the massive case: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a mass term for a bulk field modifies the conformal weight of the dual\noperator. In order to see whether something similar happens here (or in Kerr/CFT),\none would have to show that the massive Klein-Gordon equation still enjoys a hidden conformal symmetry, but now with shifted weight for \u03a6. For m 6= 0 there is an\nadditional term \u2212m2 r 2 R on the lhs of (2.5). Since\n2\nr 2 = r+\n+ 2r+ (r \u2212 r+ ) + (r \u2212 r+ )2 ,\n2\none can approximate m2 r 2 by m2 r+\nprovided that r \u2212 r+ \u226a r+ . Then, everything goes\n2\nthrough as before, with l(l + 1) replaced by l(l + 1) + m2 r+\n= h(h \u2212 1), so that now \u03a6\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fhas weight\n\ni\np\n1h\n(5.3)\n1 + (1 + 2l)2 + (4Mm)2 .\n2\nNote that, contrary to the approximation that reduces the Klein-Gordon operator to\n2\nan SL(2, R) Casimir used in the massless case, the replacement of m2 r 2 by m2 r+\nis\na true near-horizon limit. A more detailed study of the massive case, as well as an\ninvestigation if the SL(2, R) of section 2 extends also to fields of nonvanishing spin, will\nbe presented elsewhere.\nh=\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Angela Mandelli for the caff\u00e8 d'orzo and for the nice atmosphere\nwhich has led to this paper.
