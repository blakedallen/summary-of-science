Experimental studies on peeling of an adhesive tape mounted on a cylindrical roll are usually in constant pull speed condition\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. More recently, constant load experiments have also been reported [3, 7]. Early studies by\nBikermann [5], Kaeble [6] have attempted to explain the\nresults by considering the system as a fully elastic object.\nThis is clearly inadequate as it ignores the viscoelastic\nnature of the glue at the contact surface and therefore\ncannot capture many important features of the dynamics.\nThe first detailed experimental study of Maugis and Barquins [1] show stick-slip oscillations within a window of\npull velocity with decreasing amplitude of the pull force\nas a function of the pull velocity. Further, these authors\nreport that the pull force shows sinusoidal, sawtooth and\nhighly irregular (chaotic as these authors refer to) wave\npatterns with increasing velocities. More recently, Gandur et al. have carried out a dynamical time series analysis of the force waveforms, as well as those of acoustic\nemission signals and report chaotic force waveforms at\nthe upper end of the pull velocities [3]. One characteristic feature of the peeling process is that the experimental\nstrain energy release rate shows two stable branches separated by an unstable branch. Stick-slip behavior is commonly observed in a number of systems such as jerky flow\nor the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect [8], frictional\n\n\u2217 Present address: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New\nYork, USA.\n\u2020 Electronic mail: garani@mrc.iisc.ernet.in\n\nsliding [9], and even earthquake dynamics is thought to\nresult from stick-slip of tectonic plates [10]. Stick-slip\nis characterized by the system spending most part of\nthe time in the stuck state and a short time in the slip\nstate, and is usually seen in systems subjected to a constant response where the force developed in the system is\nmeasured by dynamically coupling the system to a measuring device. One common feature of such systems is\nthat the force exhibits \"negative flow rate characteristic\"\n(NFRC). Models which attempt to explain the dynamics\nof such systems use the macroscopic phenomenological\nNFRC feature as an input, although the unstable region\nis not accessible. This is true for models dealing with the\ndynamics of the adhesive tape as well. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is no microscopic theory which predicts\nthe origin of the NFRC macroscopic law except in the\ncase of the PLC effect [11, 12] (see below).\nAs there is a considerable similarity between the peeling of an adhesive tape and the PLC effect, it is useful to\nconsider the similarities in some detail. The PLC effect\nrefers to a type of plastic instability observed when samples of dilute alloys are deformed under constant cross\nhead speeds [13]. The effect manifests itself in the form\nof a series of serrations in a range of applied strain rates\nand temperatures. This feature is much like the peeling\nof an adhesive tape. Other features common to these\ntwo situations are: abrupt onset of the large amplitude\noscillations at low applied velocities with a gradually decreasing trend and NFRC, which in the PLC effect refers\nto the existence of negative strain rate sensitivity of the\nflow stress. In the case of the PLC effect, the physical\norigin of the negative strain rate sensitivity is attributed\nto the ageing of dislocations and their tearing away from\nthe cloud of solute atoms. Recently, the origin of the\nnegative SRS has been explicitly demonstrated as arising from competing time scales of pinning and unpinning\n\n\f2\nin the Ananthakrishna's model [11, 12]. In the case of\nadhesive tape, the origin of NFRC can be attributed to\nthe viscoelastic behavior of the fluid. (Constant load and\nconstant load rate experiments are possible in the PLC\nalso.) While simple phenomenological models based on\nNFRC explain the generic features of the PLC effect [14],\nthere appears to be some doubts if the equations of motion conventionally used in the present case of peeling are\nadequate to describe the velocity jumps [2, 4]. Indeed,\nthese equations of motion are singular and pose problems\nin the numerical solutions.\nApart from detailed experimental investigation of the\npeeling process, Maugis and Barquins [1], have also contributed substantially to the understanding of the dynamics of the peeling process. However, the first dynamical analysis is due to Hong and Yue [2] who use an\n\"N\" shaped function to mimic the dependence of the peel\nforce on the rupture speed. They showed that the system of equations exhibits periodic and chaotic stick-slip\noscillations. However, the jumps in the rupture speed\nare introduced externally once the rupture velocity exceeds the limit of stability [4, 15]. Thus, the stick-slip\noscillations are not obtained as a natural consequence of\nthe equations of motion. Therefore, in our opinion the\nresults presented in Ref. [2] are the artifacts of the numerical procedure followed. Ciccotti et al. [4] interpret\nthe stick-slip jumps as catastrophes. Again, the belief\nthat the jumps in the rupture velocity cannot be obtained from the equations of motion appears to be the\nmotivation for introducing the action of discrete operators on the state of the system to interpret the stick-slip\njumps [4], though they do not demonstrate the correctness of such a framework for the set of equations. Lastly,\nthere are no reports that explain the decrease in the amplitude of the peel force with increasing pull speed as\nobserved in experiments. As there is a general consensus that these equations of motion correctly describe the\nexperimental system, a proper resolution of this question\n(on the absence of dynamical jumps in these equations)\nassumes importance.\nThe purpose of this paper is to show that the dynamics of stick-slip during peeling can be explained using a\ndifferential-algebraic scheme meant for such singular situations [16] and demonstrate the rich dynamics inherent\nto these equations. In what follows we first derive the\nequations of motion (used earlier [2]) by introducing an\nappropriate Lagrangian for the system. Then, we use\nan algorithm meant to solve differential-algebraic equations [16] and present the results of our simulations for\nvarious parameter values. One of our major findings is\nthat inertia has a strong influence on the dynamics. In\naddition, following the dynamization scheme similar to\nthe one used in the context of the PLC effect [14], we\nsuggest that the peel force depends on the applied velocity. Using this form of peel force leads to the decreasing\nnature of the magnitude of the pull force as a function\nof applied velocity. For certain values of the inertia, we\nfind canard type solutions. These numerical results are\n\n\u03c9\n\nO\n\nl\n\n\u03b1\nR\n\n\u03b8\n\nO'\nL\n\nP\nFIG. 1: Schematic plot of experimental setup\n\ncaptured to a reasonable accuracy using a set of approximations valid in different regimes of the parameter space.\nEven though, our emphasis is on demonstrating the correctness of these equations of motion and richness of the\ninherent dynamics that capture the qualitative features\nof the peeling process, we also attempt to make a comparison of the experimental results mentioned above to\nthe extent possible.\nII.\n\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we start by considering\nthe geometry of the experimental setup shown schematically in Fig. 1. An adhesive roll of radius R is mounted\non an axis passing through O normal to the paper and\nis pulled at a constant velocity V by a motor positioned\nat O\u2032 with a force F acting along P O\u2032 . Let the distance\nbetween O and O\u2032 be l, and that between the contact\npoint P to O\u2032 be L. The point P moves with a local\nvelocity v which can undergo rapid bursts in the velocity\nduring rupture. The force required to peel the tape is\nusually called the force of adhesion denoted by f . The\ntwo measured branches referred to earlier, are those of\nthe function f in a steady state situation of constant\npulling velocity (i.e., there are no accelerations). The\nline L makes an angle \u03b8 with the tangent at the contact\npoint P . The point P subtends an angle \u03b1 at O, with\nthe horizontal line OO\u2032 . We denote the elastic constant\nof the adhesive tape by k, the elastic displacement of the\ntape by u, the angular velocity by \u03c9 and the moment\nof inertia of the roll by I. The angular velocity itself is\nidentified by \u03c9 = \u03b1\u0307 + v/R. The geometry of the setup\ngives L cos \u03b8 = \u2212l sin \u03b1 and L sin \u03b8 = l cos \u03b1 \u2212 R which\nfurther gives, L2 = l2 +R2 \u22122lR cos \u03b1. The total velocity\nV at O\u2032 is then made up of three contributions [1], given\nby V = v + u\u0307 \u2212 L\u0307, which gives\nv = V + L\u0307 \u2212 u\u0307 = V \u2212 R cos \u03b8 \u03b1\u0307 \u2212 u\u0307.\n\n(1)\n\nFollowing standard methods in mechanics, it is straightforward to derive the equations of motion for \u03b1 and \u03c9\nby considering (\u03b1, \u03b1\u0307, u, u\u0307) as the generalized co-ordinates.\nThe corresponding Lagrangian of the system can be written as\nL(\u03b1, \u03b1\u0307, u, u\u0307) =\n\nI\nk\n[\u03c9(\u03b1, \u03b1\u0307, u, u\u0307)]2 \u2212 u2 .\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n\nwhere f (v, V ) physically represents the peel force which\nwe assume is dependent on rupture speed as well as the\npull speed assumed to be derivable from a potential function \u03a6(v, V ). The physical origin of this is due to the\ncompetition between the internal relaxation time scale of\nthe viscoelastic fluid and the time scale determined by\nthe applied velocity [17]. When the applied velocity is\nlow, there is sufficient time for the viscoelastic fluid to\nrelax. As we increase the applied velocity, the relaxation\nof the fluid gets increasingly difficult and thus behaves\nmuch like an elastic substance. The effect of competing\ntime scales is well represented by Deborah number [18]\nwhich is the ratio of time scale for structural relaxation\nto the characteristic time scale for deformation. Indeed,\nin the studies on Hele-Shaw cell with mud as the viscous\nfluid, one observes a transition from viscous fingering to\nviscoelastic fracturing [19] with increasing rate of invasion of the displacing fluid.\nAs stated in the Introduction, the existing models do\nnot explain the decreasing amplitude of pull force. Similar feature observed in the PLC serrations has been modeled using a scheme referred to as dynamization of the\nnegative strain rate sensitivity (SRS) of the flow stress\nf (\u01eb\u0307P ) [14, 20], where \u01eb\u0307p is the plastic strain rate. Based\non arguments similar to the preceding paragraph, they\nmodify this function to depend on the applied strain rate,\n\u01eb\u0307a , i.e., the negative SRS of the flow stress is taken to be\nf (\u01eb\u0307P , \u01eb\u0307a ) such that the gap between the maximum and\nthe minimum of the function f (\u01eb\u0307p , \u01eb\u0307a ) decreases with increasing \u01eb\u0307a . Following this, we consider f to depend on\nV also, in a way that the gap in f decreases as a function\nof the pull speed V (Fig. 2).\nUsing the Lagrange equations of motion,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L \u2202R\n\u2212\n+\n= 0,\n(4)\ndt \u2202 \u03b1\u0307\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202 \u03b1\u0307\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202L \u2202R\nd \u2202L\n\u2212\n+\n= 0.\n(5)\ndt \u2202 u\u0307\n\u2202u\n\u2202 u\u0307\nwe obtain the same set of ordinary differential equations\nas in Ref.

This point is stable for f \u2032 (V, V ) > 0\nand unstable for f \u2032 (V, V ) < 0. As V is varied such that\nthe sign of f \u2032 (V, V ) changes from negative to positive\nvalue, the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and a\nlimit cycle appears. The limit cycles reflect the abrupt\njumps between the two positive slope branches of the\nfunction f (v, V ).\nIII.\n\nALGORITHM\n\nThe singular nature of these equations becomes clear\nif one were to consider the differential form of Eq.

The\ndecreasing nature of the gap between the maximum and\nminimum of f (v, V ) for increasing V is clear from Fig.\n2(a). [The values of f (v, V ) could not be correctly determined as G(V ) is in J/m2 requiring more details. However, the value of Fmax is closer to Ref. [2] and the jumps\nin v are similar to those in experiments.] The reason for\nusing the form given by Eq. (14) is that the effects of dynamization are easily included through its dependence on\nthe pulling velocity while more complicated terms are required to mimic completely the experimental curve (particularly the flat portion). However, we stress that the\ntrend of the results remains unaffected when the actual\nexperimental curve is used except for the magnitude of\nvelocity jumps and the force values.\n\n250\n230\n\n4\n\nt\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\nFIG. 3: (a) A typical phase space trajectory in the v \u2212 F\nplane for V = 0.4, I = 10\u22125 .

These equations exhibit rich\ndynamics, some even unanticipated. Here we report\ntypical results for two important parameters, namely\nthe pull velocity V (m/s) and the inertia I (kg m2 ),\nkeeping the elastic constant of the tape k = 1000 N/m,\nR = 0.1 m and l = 1 m [2].

In both cases (periodic as well as chaotic) the\ntrajectory jumps from high velocity branch (CD) to the\nlow velocity branch before traversing the entire branch\nor sometimes going beyond the values permitted by f .\nThe value of F at which the orbit jumps is different\nfor different cycles. For I = 10\u22125 , at high velocity, say\nV = 4, the phase plot is periodic.\n\nc\ng\n\ne\n\n10\n\n(a) Consider keeping inertia I at a low value (say\nI = 10\u22125 ) and V also at a low value (say, near the top,\nsay V = 0.4 ). Here we observe regular saw tooth form\nfor the pull force F . The phase plot in the F -v plane\nis as shown in Fig. 3(a). The corresponding function\nf (v, V ) is also shown by the continuous curve. We see\nthat the trajectory jumps almost instantaneously from\nB to C on reaching the maximum of f (v, V ) (or from D\nto A when it reaches the minimum). The system spends\nconsiderably more time on AB compared to that on CD.\nHowever, this feature of jumping of the trajectory at the\nlimit of stability is only true for small values of I and\nwhen V is near the limit of stability. At slightly higher\npull velocity, say V = 1, even for small I, say I = 10\u22125 ,\nthe jumps occur even before reaching the top or bottom\n( the points B and D) as can be seen from Fig. 3(b) for\nV = 1. The small amplitude high frequency oscillations\nseen in the phase plots [ Fig. 3(a), and 3(b)] on the\nbranch AB are due to the inertial effect, i.e., finite value\nof I. These oscillations are better seen on the \u03b1(t) plot\nshown in Fig. 3(c). For these values of parameters, the\nsystem is aperiodic.\n\nb\nf\n\n(a)\n\nF\n\nbe mentioned briefly. ( Henceforth, we drop the units for\nthe sake of brevity.) We find that the observed jumps\nof the orbit in the v-F plane occur in a fully dynamical\nway. More importantly, we find all the three possibilities\nnamely, the orbit can jump when it approaches the\nlimit of stability, before or beyond that permitted by\nf (v, V ). The dynamics can be broadly classified into\nlow, intermediate and high regimes of inertia.\n\n8\n4\n0\n4\n\n4.1\n\nt\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Phase space trajectory in the v \u2212 F plane for\na single cycle for I = 10\u22122 and V = 1.

[The range\nab in Fig. 4(c) expands. Compare Fig. 5(a).] The magnitude of \u2206F on the CD branch for small V and moderately or large I, gradually decreases with increasing V .\nThe magnitude of \u2206F itself decreases as I is increased.\nIn the limit of large V and I, the drops in F and \u03b1 become quite small which are now located near the maxima\nand minima of these curves. This is shown in Figs. 5(a)\nand 5(b). The sinusoidal nature is now obvious even in\nF (t) unlike for smaller V and I where it is clear only in\n\u03b1(t) for the low v branch. Note that for V = 4, the nature of f (v, 4) is nearly flat. This induces certain changes\nin the v \u2212 F phase plot that are not apparent in F and\n\u03b1. The jumps between the two branches are now concentrated in a dense band at low and high values of F . In\nthis case, the maximum (minimum) value of F is significantly larger (less) than fmax (fmin ). These rapid jumps\nbetween the branches manifest as jitter at the top and\nbottom of F and \u03b1.\nUnlike for small V [Fig. 4(a)], the nature of the trajectory in Fig. 5(c) is different. After reaching a critical\nvalue of F near the maximum value of F (the point b),\nthe orbit spirals upwards and then descends down till\nanother critical value of F (the point c) is reached. Having reached c, the orbit monotonically comes down till d\nwhere it jumps to the AB branch. Beyond this point, it\nagain spirals upwards till the point a is reached. Thereafter, F monotonically increases till b is reached. The regions ab and cd are the regions where F shows a near sinusoidal form. The regions bc and da are the regions where\nthe orbit jumps between the branches rapidly. These\nmanifest themselves as bursts of v which tend to bunch\ntogether almost into a band. [Compare Fig. 4(d) with\nFig. 5(d).] It is interesting to note that the jumps between the two branches occur exactly at points where\n\n450\n\n250\nk\n\na\nd\n\n150\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nv\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n(d)\n8\n6\n\nv\n\nf (v, V ), i.e., \u2206F is much smaller than fmax \u2212 fmin . The\npull force F cascades down through a series of back and\nforth jumps between the two branches till the lowest\nvalue of F for the cycle is reached. Note that F at the\npoint n is less than fmin . For the sake of clarity, two\ndifferent portions of the trajectory are marked abcdef g\nand ijklmna corresponding to the top and bottom\nregions of the plot. The corresponding points are also\nidentified on the F (t) plot. After reaching n, the orbit\njumps to a on AB, the trajectory decides to move up\nall the way till F reaches a maximum value (larger than\nfmax , the point b) without jumping to the CD branch.\nThis part of F as a function of time, which is nearly\nlinear on AB, (i.e., the segment ab) displays a noticeable\nsinusoidal modulation. The sinusoidal form is better\nseen in \u03b1 [Fig. 4(b)]. Note that the successive drops in\nF are of increasing magnitude. The jumps between the\ntwo branches in the v \u2212 F plane are seen as bursts of v\n[Fig. 4(d)].

The variables are aperiodic for the set\nof parameters. The phase plots appear to be generated\nby an effective f (v, V ) that is being cycled. [This visual\nfeeling is mainly due to the fact that jumps between the\nbranches still occur at the maximum and minimum of\nf (v, V ).]\nThe influence of k is generally to increase the range\nof the pull force F as can be easily anticipated and to\ndecrease the associated time scale.\nIt may be desirable to comment on the similarity of\nthe nature of the force waveforms displayed by the model\nequations with those seen in experiments. As mentioned\nin the introduction, apart from qualitative statements on\nthe waveforms in Ref. [1] (such as periodic, sawtooth etc.,\nwhich are seen in the model as well), it should be stressed\nthat there is a paucity of quantitative characterization of\nthe waveforms. In this respect, the study by Gandur\net al. [3] fills the gap to some extent. These authors\nhave carried out a dynamical analysis of the time series\nfor various values of the pull velocities (for a fixed value\nof the inertia corresponding to their experimental roller\ntape geometry). In order to compare this result, we have\ncalculated the largest Lyapunov exponent for a range of\nvalues of I and V . The region of chaos is in the domain\nof small pull velocities V when I is small. The maximum\nLyapunov exponent turns out to be rather high, typically\naround 7.5 bits/s in contrast to the small values reported\nin Ref. [2]. The large magnitude of the positive exponent in our case can be traced to the large changes in\nthe Jacobian, as df (v, V )/dv varies over several order of\nmagnitude(\u223c 106 ) as a function of the peeling velocity\nand hence as a function of time. In contrast, Hong et\nal. use an N shaped curve where df (v, V )/dv is constant\n(and small) on both low and high V branches. However,\nthese large values of Lyapunov exponents are consistent\nwith rather high values obtained by Gandur et al. [3]\nfrom time series analysis of the pull force. We also find\nchaos for intermediate and high inertia in the region of\nhigh velocities where the value of the Lyapunov exponent is small, typically 0.5. The small value here again\ncan be traced to the small changes in df (v, V )/dv at high\nvelocities.\nIt must be mentioned that comparison with experiments is further complicated due to the presence of a two\nparameter family of solutions strongly dependent on both\nI and V . Thus, the phase diagram is complicated, i.e.,\nthe sequence of solutions encountered in the I-V plane\nas we change V or I or both does not in general display\nany specific ordering of periodic and chaotic trajectories\n(see Fig. 1 of Ref. [21]) usually found in the well known\nroutes to chaos. (For instance 2n periods should be observed before the odd periods [22].) Indeed, in our model,\nwe find the odd periods 3,5,7 etc, on increasing V (or I),\nwithout seeing all the 2n periods. (These odd periods\nalso imply chaos at parameter values prior to that corresponding to these periods.) In view of this, a correct\n\n200\n\n1e-05\n\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\n10\n\nv\nFIG. 7: A phase plot of canard type of solution in v \u2212 F plane\nfor V = 0.4 and I = 10\u22123 . (v, V are in m/s, F in N, I in kg\nm2 and t in s.)\n\ncomparison with experiments requires an appropriate cut\nin the I \u2212 V plane consistent with the experimental values of I and V even where they are given. However, as\nthe values of I are not provided, full mapping of chaotic\nsolutions is not possible. (We also note that Gandur et\nal. [3] use a different tape from that used in Ref. [1],\nas is clear from the instability range, leading additional\ndifficulties in comparison.)\nOne quantitative result that can be compared with experiment is the decreasing trend of the force drop magnitude. We have calculated the magnitude of the force\ndrops during stick-slip phase as a function the pull velocity V for both low ( I = 10\u22125 ) and high (I = 10\u22122 ) inertia cases. Figure 6 shows the monotonically decreasing\ntrend of average \u2206F (t) as V is increased, for both small\nand large I, a feature observed in experiments [1]. These\ntwo distinct behaviors are a result of the dynamization\nof f (v, V ) as in Eq. (14).\nFinally, as another illustration of the richness of the\ndynamics seen in our numerical simulations, we show in\nFig. 7, a plot of an orbit that sticks to unstable part\n\n\f8\nof the manifold before jumping back to the AB branch.\nSuch solutions are known as canards [23]. Though canard\ntype of solutions are rare, we have observed them for\nhigh values of I and low values of V . In our case, such\nsolutions are due to the competition of time scale due\nto inertia and that due to v. This again illustrates the\ninfluence of inertia of the roll on the dynamics of peeling.\nIt is clear that these equations exhibit rich and complex dynamics. A few of these features are easily understandable, but others are not. For instance, the sawtooth form of F for low inertia and low pull velocity can\nbe explained as resulting from the trajectory sticking to\nstable part of f (v, V ) and jumping only when it reaches\nthe limit of stability. For these parameter values, as the\ntime spent by the system is negligible during the jumps\nbetween the branches AB and CD (and vice versa), the\nsystem spends most of the time on the branch AB and\nmuch less on CD due to its steep nature. Then, from\nEq. (9), it is clear that we should find a sawtooth form\nwhenever the peel velocity v jumps across the branch to\na value of v larger than the pull velocity V .\nHowever, several features exhibited by these system of\nequations are much too complicated to understand. We\nfirst list the issues that need to be explained.\n(I) Small I.\n(a) We find high frequency tiny oscillations superposed\non the linearly increasing F [on the AB branch or\nbetter seen in the \u03b1 plot Fig. 3(c)]. This needs to be\nunderstood.\n(b) The numerical solutions show that the influence of\ninertia can be important even for small I and small V .\nFor instance, the jumps between AB and CD branches\noccur even before F reaches the extremum values of f .\n(II) For intermediate and high values of inertia, for low\nV case.\n(a) We observe several relatively small amplitude saw\ntooth form of F on the descending part of the pull force\nF . These appear as a sequence of jumps between the two\nbranches in the v \u2212 F plane which we shall refer to as the\n\"jumping mode\". A proper estimate of the magnitude of\n\u2206F is desirable.\n(b) In addition, there appears to be a critical value\nof F for a given cycle below which the return jumps\nfrom AB to CD stop and one observes a monotonically\nincreasing trend in F [ab in Fig. 4(c)].\n(III) High I and high V .\n(a) The jumps between the branches occur at a very\nhigh frequency [Fig. 5(c)] and now are located near the\nextremum values of F and \u03b1. But these regions are separated by a stretch where the orbit monotonically increases on the AB branch and monotonically decreases\non the CD branch. We need to elucidate the underlying causes leading to the switching between the jumping\nmode and monotonically increasing or decreasing mode.\n(b) For large V , say V = 4 and large I (Fig. 5), the\n\nextent of values of F (t) range between 185 and 450 much\nbeyond f (v, 4) whose range is around 300. This feature\nis less dominant for small I and small V case.\nV.\n\nAPPROXIMATE ANALYSIS OF THE\nDYNAMICS\n\nAs the dynamics is described by a coupled set of differential equations with an algebraic constraint, the results are not transparent. We first attempt to get insight\ninto the complex dynamics through some simple approximations valid in each of the regimes of the parameters.\nSolution of these approximate equations will require appropriate initial values for the relevant variables which\nwill be provided from the exact numerical solutions. Due\nto the nature of approximations, the results are expected\nto capture only the trend and order of magnitudes of the\neffects that are being calculated. But as we will show,\neven the numbers obtained match quite closely with the\nexact numerical results.\nOur idea is to capture the dynamics through a single\nequation ( as far as possible or at most two as in the high\nI and V case) by including all the relevant time scales and\nsolve the relevant equation on each branch. For this we\nnote that the equation for \u03b1 and v play a crucial role as\nthe inertial contribution appears only through Eqs. (6)\nand (7) and the time spent by the system is controlled\nby the equation for v, Eq. (12). Using Eqs. (6) and (7),\nwe get\n\u03b1\u0308 = \u2212\n\nF (t)R\u03b1\n\u2212 v\u0307/R.\nI\n\n(15)\n\nThe general equation for \u03b1 can be written down by using\nEq. (12), in Eq. (15), we get\n\u03b1\u0308 = \u2212\n\u2243 \u2212\n\nF R\u03b1 [\u1e1e (1 + \u03b1) + F \u03b1\u0307]\n,\n\u2212\nI\nRf \u2032\n\n(16)\n\nF R\u03b1 [\u1e1e + F \u03b1\u0307]\n.\n\u2212\nI\nRf \u2032\n\n(17)\n\nIn obtaining Eq. (17), we have used 1 + \u03b1 \u2243 1 which\nis valid except for high I and high V . Further, in\nmost cases, we can drop R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 as the magnitude of\nthis term is small and use \u1e1e \u2243 k(V \u2212 v). To be\nconsistent we use F (t) \u2243 Fin + k(V \u2212 v)t. We note\nhowever that even for high I and high V where \u03b1 is\nnot small, dropping 1+\u03b1 and R\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 causes only 10% error.\nCase I, small I\nOn the low velocity branch AB, as v/R is small in Eq.\n(6), we can drop v\u0307 term in Eq. 15. Thus,\nI \u03b1\u0308 \u2248 \u2212F R\u03b1.\n\n(18)\n\nNote that for the low inertia case, sin\u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1 approximation is clearly justified [see Eq. (7)]. Using this equation,\nwe first get an idea of the relevant time scales as I is\n\n\f9\nincreased.\nCase a\nConsider the low velocity branch AB where the small\namplitude high frequency oscillations are seen on the\nnearly linearly increasing part of F [given by F (t) =\nFmin + k(V \u2212 v)t, see for instance Fig. 3(b)]. A rough\nestimate of this time spent on this branch is obtained\nby (fmax \u2212 fmin )/kV \u223c t. Using fmax \u223c 284 and\nfmin \u223c 200, [from Fig. 3(b)], we get t = 0.084 (compared to the correct value of 0.063 which we shall obtain soon) which is much larger than the period of the\nhigh frequency oscillation. Thus, we could take the local value F for the purpose of calculating the period\nof the high frequency oscillation. Consider the orbit\nat the lowest value of F for which we can use Fmin \u223c\nfmin (v,\np 1) \u223c 200. Then using Eq. (18), the frequency\n\u03bd = (F R/I)/2\u03c0 = 225 for I = 10\u22125 which gives the\nperiod of oscillation T = 4.44 \u00d7 10\u22123 . This agrees very\nwell with the exact numerical value T = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22123. This\nfrequency decreases when the force reaches the maximum value Fmax \u223c fmax (v, 1) \u223c 284 to \u03bd = 261 giving T = 3.69 \u00d7 10\u22123 which is again surprisingly close to\nthe numerical value 3.72 \u00d7 10\u22123 . In the numerical solutions, we find that the period gradually decreases [see\nFig. 3(c)]. This feature is also easily recovered by using\nF = Fmin + k(V \u2212 v)t. This leads to an additional term\nin the equation of motion for \u03b1 in Eq. (18),\nI \u03b1\u0308 = \u2212F (t)R\u03b1/I = \u2212[Fmin + k(V \u2212 v)t]R\u03b1/I,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere t is the time required for F to reach Fmax starting\nfrom Fmin . Here again the v term can be dropped. If\nFmin was absent, the equation has the Airy's form. (Note\nthat for this case also we could assume Fmin \u223c fmin\nand Fmax \u223c fmax .) Though this equation does not\nhave an exact solution, we note that we\np could take \u03b1\nto have a sinusoidal form with 2\u03c0\u03bd = (F R/I) where\nF is treated as a slowly increasing parameter. (This assumption works quite well.) The above equation captures\nthe essential features of the numerical solution. The numerical solution of Eq. (19) ( as also this representation\n) gives the decreasing trend of the small amplitude high\nfrequency oscillations. (Note that the Airy equation itself\ngives a decreasing amplitude [24].)\nWe note that Eq. (18) is valid on the AB branch where\nv is small even for high inertia and small V case. Thus,\nwe may be able to recover the gross time scales using\nthis equation. Our numerical results show that as we\nincrease the inertia, \u03b1 exhibits a sinusoidal form on the\nAB branch [see Fig. 4(b)], although one full cycle is not\nseen. We note that though the value of \u03b1 is much larger\nthan that for small I, we can still use the above equations\n[Eq. (18) and (19)]. On this branch F increases from a\nvalue Fmin \u223c fmin to a maximum Fmax \u223c fmax . For\nlarge I = 10\u22122 ( and V = 1), we get a rough estimate\nof the period by using the mean value of F \u223c 240 in Eq.\n18. This gives a period T = 0.128 which already agrees\nsatisfactorily with the numerically exact value T =0.11\n\nconsidering the approximation used (i.e., using the mean\nF ). A better estimate can be obtained by using Eq. (19).\nFor the high I and V case, Fig. 5 for V = 4 shows\nthat the wave forms are nearly sinusoidal except for a\njitter at the top and bottom. For this case, f (v, 4) is\nnearly flat over the entire range of values of v, with a\nvalue \u223c 300. Here, even on the AB branch, we can not\nignore the v\u0307 term in Eq. (15). However, one sees that\nas vmin = 0.335 and vmax = 1.25 which suggest that\nto the leading order, we could ignore the v\u0307 term. This\ngives the period T = 0.115. From Fig. 5(b), considering\nonly the monotonically decreasing part (ab), the value of\nT /2 = 0.53 read off from the figure compares reasonably\nwell with this value.\nFor the CD branch, as v is not small, the v\u0307/R term\nappears to be important in Eq. (15). Some idea of when\nthis term is important can be had by looking at the time\nscales arising from inertia, namely, F R/I and the coefficient of the damping term, F/Rf \u2032 in Eq. (17). Consider\nV = 1 for I = 10\u22125 and 10\u22122 . The period obtained\nby assuming the mean value of F = 240 in F R/I gives\n4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for I = 10\u22125 compared to 0.128 for I = 10\u22122 .\nThese numbers can be compared with the time scale\nRf \u2032 /F which is 0.01 (where we have used f \u2032 \u223c 25 from\nnumerical simulations for V = 1). This shows that for\nhigh inertia the damping coefficient F/Rf \u2032 in Eq. (17) is\nimportant. We will discuss this issue in more detail later.\nCase b\nNow we focus on the origin of jumps between the\nbranches. We note that the jumps from CD to AB (or\nvice versa) occur only when the peel velocity v reaches\na value where f \u2032 (v, V ) = 0. This also means that the\ntime scale on each branch, whether it spends only a short\ntime or not, is controlled by the equation for v. However,\nclearly the influence of inertia needs to be included. Here\nwe present an approximate equation for v which is valid\nin the various limits of the parameters:\nv\u0307 = [\u1e1e (t)(1 + \u03b1(t)) + F (t)\u03b1\u0307]/f \u2032 ,\n[k(V \u2212 v) + (Fin + k(V \u2212 v)t)\u03b1\u0307)]\n\u2243\n,\nf\u2032\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwhere the time t is time spent on the branch considered ( low or high V ). In Eq. (21), we have again used\n\u1e1e \u2243 k(V \u2212 v) and F \u2243 Fin + k(V \u2212 v)t with the same\napproximation used in Eq. (17).\nWe now attempt to obtain correct estimates of the time\nspent by the orbit on each branch starting with the least\ncomplicated situation of the low inertia and small V . For\nthis case, on the low velocity branch, one can use the\nsinusoidal solution for \u03b1, namely \u03b1 = \u03b1in sin(2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c6),\nwhere \u03c6 is a phase factor which also includes thep\ncontribution arising from the jump as well and 2\u03c0\u03bd = (F R/I)\nwith F \u2243 Fin + kV t . Both \u03b1in and \u03c6 needs to be supplied. Alternately, one can use Eq. (18) with Eq. (21)\nfor which we provide \u03b1in and \u03b1\u0307in at the point from the\nexact numerical solutions. We stress that this procedure\nis not equivalent to solving all the equations, as the only\n\n\f10\n\n0.4\n\n16\n\nv\n\n0.6\n\nv\n\nequation we use is Eq. (21) with the form of \u03b1 already\ndetermined from the equation for \u03b1. [We note here that\nthough we have used the sinusoidal form of \u03b1 along with\nthe initial conditions on \u03b1in , \u03c6, it is simpler to supply\nthe initial conditions \u03b1in , \u03b1\u0307in and use Eq. (18).] We\nnote here that f \u2032 is a crucial factor that determines the\ntime at which the orbit jumps from one branch to the\nother. Equation (21) needs to be integrated from vin to\nvf that are determined by the pulling velocity V , i.e., the\nform of f (v, V ).\nFor the low v branch f \u2032 term makes a significant contribution for the time spent by the trajectory on AB.\nIndeed, one can obtain the order of magnitude of the\ntime spent by the orbit on AB by using a crude approximation for f \u2032 (v, 1) = \u2212230(0.5 \u2212 v). This can be easily\nintegrated from v = vin \u223c 0.0188, to v = vf \u223c 0.4 which\nalready gives \u2206t = 0.075. This number is comparable to\nthe numerically exact value 0.063. A correct estimate can\nbe obtained by using f \u2032 from Eq. (14) with the sinusoidal\nform \u03b1 or Eq. (18). (We have used Fin = 211.5\np from the\nnumerical simulations for V = 1 and 2\u03c0\u03bd = [RF (t)/I]\nwith F = Fin + k(V \u2212 v)t.) This gives nearly the exact\nnumerical value of \u2206t = 0.063. In fact, this solution also\ncaptures the oscillatory growth nature of v quite accurately. The approximate form of v(t) (continuous line)\nalong with the numerically exact solution ( dotted line)\nare shown in Fig. 8. Using \u2206t in F = Fin + k(V \u2212 v)\u2206t\ngives \u2206F = 63 and F = 274.5 which is in good agreement with the exact numerical value of Fmax = 275. It\nis interesting to note that this value is much less than\nfmax = 283 [see Fig. 3(b)] or equivalently \u2206F is less than\nfmax \u2212 fmin , what is also observed in our exact numerical simulation. The underlying mechanism of jumping of\nthe orbit before F reaches fmax also becomes clear from\nthe analysis (Fig. 8). We note that the magnitude of the\noscillatory component in v grows till it reaches vmax permitted by f (v, 1). Then, the orbit has to jump to CD.\nThus, the approximate solution gives an insight into the\ncause of the orbit jumping even before F reaches fmax\n(for small I).\nFor the CD branch also, the dominant term is f \u2032 . Indeed, any reasonable function which has the same geometrical form of f shown in Fig. 2 will give good results\nfor \u2206t. Using the correct form of f \u2032 , we get \u2206t = 0.005\nwhich is close to the exact result. This again gives correct magnitude of \u2206F = 72.5. In addition the nature of\nthe v(t) obtained by this approximation is close to the\nexact numerical solution shown in the inset of Fig. 8.\nCase II, intermediate and high I and low V\nThe most difficult feature of our numerical solutions\nto understand is the dynamical mechanism leading to a\nseries of drops in the pull force seen on the descending\nbranch of F (t) for intermediate and high values of inertia\nand for a range of V values. Consider the high inertia and\nlow V case (say I = 10\u22122 and V = 1) shown in Fig. 4.\nAs stated earlier, there are two different issues that need\nto be understood here. First, the series of small force\ndrops \u2206F and second the monotonic increasing nature\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\nt\n\n0.02\n\nt\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nFIG. 8: Comparison of approximate solution (continuous)\nwith the numerically exact solution (dotted) of v(t) for I =\n10\u22125 and V = 1 for the AB branch. The inset shows a similar\ncomparison of v(t) on the CD branch. (v, V are in m/s, I in\nkg m2 and t in s.)\n\nof F on the AB branch.\nIn this case, as already discussed, the coefficient of \u03b1\u0307,\nnamely, F/Rf \u2032 term in Eq. (17) determines the time\nscale on CD, while on AB, the term F R\u03b1/I dominates.\nThus, the general equation valid for this case is\n\u03b1\u0308 \u2243 \u2212\n\nF R\u03b1\nF \u03b1\u0307\n\u2212\n,\nI\nRf \u2032 (v)\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we use F = Fin + k(V \u2212 v)t. [Note that we have\ndropped k(V \u2212 v) term from Eq. (17) as this term does\nnot have any dependence on \u03b1 or \u03b1\u0307.]\nWe start with the cascading effect. Consider the orbit\nwhen it is at the highest value of Fin = 295.6 on the CD\nbranch for which we can drop F R\u03b1/I term. As f \u2032 is a\nfunction of v, and F also depends on time, it appears that\nwe need to use coupled equations \u03b1\u0307 = \u2212F \u03b1/Rf \u2032 with Eq.\n(21). However, the numerical solution of these equations\nshow that one can make further approximation by taking\nf \u2032 to be constant taken at v = 15.54 and F = Fin , as\nthe time spent on this branch is very small. The error\nin using this approximation is within 10%. Indeed, using\n\u03b1in = \u22120.0304, \u03b1\u0307in = \u2212160 and numerically integrating Eq. (21), along with Eq. (22) from vin = 15.54 to\nvf = 8.7 gives \u2206t = 1.78 \u00d7 10\u22123 . This compares reasonably with the numerical value of 1.89 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Using this\nwe get \u2206F = 19.4 which compares well with the numerically exact value 19.8. At this point the orbit jumps to\nthe low velocity AB branch (to the point e). Thus, as\n\u2206t is small, for all practical purposes, we can ignore the\ndependence of f on v and F on t and use \u03b1 to be an exponentially decreasing function for analytical estimates.\nThese analytical estimates already give reasonably accurate numbers.\nOn the AB branch, the dominant time scale is determined by F R\u03b1/I, and we can use the approximate sinusoidal form in Eq. (21), or Eq. (18) along with Eq. (21)\n\n\f11\nfor the time evolution from the point e. Integrating from\nvin = 0.0188 to vf = 0.4 with the appropriate initial values \u03b1in = 0.239, \u03b1\u0307in = 11.9 (or \u03b1, \u03c6) and Fin = 276.53,\ngives \u2206t = 0.016 which again compares very well with exact numerical value \u2206t = 0.0164. This gives \u2206F = 11.61.\nThe procedure for calculating the time spent by the orbit\non CD and AB is the same and we find that successive\nvalues of \u2206F increases which is again consistent with\nwhat is seen in Figs. 4(a) and 4(c).\nContinuing this procedure, we find that a minimum\nvalue of F = 186.95 for the cycle is reached. Now\nconsider the time evolution of F on AB that should\nlead to a monotonically increasing nature as seen in the\nnumerically exact solution. As this point corresponds\nto the point at which the dynamics switches from the\njumping mode to the monotonically increasing nature\nof F (i.e., the stretch ab), we discuss this in some detail. For the point a, we have used the initial condition\n\u03b1in = 0.0599, \u03b1\u0307in = 9.7 and integrating Eq. (21) and Eq.\n(18) (or the sinusoidal form of \u03b1) from v = vmin = 0.0188\nto v = vmax = 0.4 gives \u2206t = 0.117. This is nearly the\nvalue 0.114 obtained from the exact numerical integration. This gives \u2206F = 117 and Fmax = 303.95 which\ncompares very well with the exact numerical value. In\naddition, the growth form of v obtained from this approximation (continuous line) agrees very well with that\nof the exact numerical solution (dotted line) as shown in\nFig. 9. The discrepancy seen in the figure can be reduced\nfor instance if we include the terms neglected in Eq. (16)\nsuch as \u1e1e and using 1 + \u03b1 in Eq. (20).\nNow we come to the crucial question. How does the\nsystem know that it has to go from a to b, while just\nduring the previous visit to the point k on AB branch\nlead only to a small increase in \u2206F [Fig. 4(a) and 4(c)]\nbefore jumping to CD? To understand this, we recall\nthat on AB, a sinusoidal solution is allowed. First, one\ncan notice a few differences in the initial conditions\nbetween the point a and k. For the point k, the initial\nconditions taken from the exact numerical solution are\n\u03b1in = 0.298 and \u03b1\u0307in = 18.3. ( Fin = 193.37), while for\nthe point a, \u03b1in = 0.0589, \u03b1\u0307in = 9.7. However, for \u03b1\nto begin a sinusoidal form, the initial value of \u03b1\u0307 = 18.3\nis much higher than the natural slope. The local slope\nfor any sinusoidal form is maximum when the variable\nis close to zero. In Fig. 4(b), the sinusoidal form starts\nwhen \u03b1 is close to zero (\u223c 0.0589 at a) where the local\nslope should be close to the maximum value. Near\n\u03b1 \u223c 0, the local slope is the product of the maximum\namplitude of \u03b1, say, \u03b10 (in the sinusoidal stretch ab) and\n2\u03c0\u03bd. (We have assumed \u03b1 = \u03b10 sin2\u03c0\u03bdt by dropping the\nphase factor.) Thus, one should have \u03b1\u0307 \u2243 2\u03c0\u03bd\u03b10 when\n\u03b1 \u223c 0. Using the value \u03b10 = 0.23 from exact numerical\nsolution and \u03bd \u223c 6.88 at Fin = 186.95, we find that\n\u03b1\u0307 \u223c 10 near \u03b1 \u223c 0. Indeed, this is satisfied only at a\nwhere \u03b1\u0307in = 9.7. [Note that \u03b1 is not symmetric around\nzero due to the presence of v in Eq. (6) which has been\nignored for the purpose of present discussion.] However,\n\u03b1\u0307in = 18.3 at k is significantly higher than the slope\n\npermitted for \u03b1 to start a sinusoidal sojourn. This forces\nthe orbit to make one more small loop (AB to CD and\nback) so that the initial value of \u03b1\u0307in is commensurate for\n\u03b1 to start a sinusoidal form. Indeed, the initial values of\n\u03b1\u0307 at all the earlier visits to AB branch keep decreasing\nuntil it reaches a value that is consistent to begin the\nsinusoidal growth. Once this is satisfied, the monotonic\nincreasing behavior from a to b is seen. As we will show\nthis is the mechanism operating for high I and V case.\nCase III, High I and V\nFor this case, even on the AB branch, v\u0307/R cannot be\nignored in Eq. (15) and thus one needs to use coupled\nEqs. (21) and (15). Calculations follow much the same\nlines and give correct values for \u2206t and \u2206F on both the\nbranches during the rapid jumps.\nAgain, we need to answer when exactly does the system\nknow to switch from a rapid jumping mode to monotonically increasing on AB or decreasing mode on CD?\nConsider the last of the rapid jumps from CD to AB\n(just prior to the point a) in Fig. 5(c). The corresponding\npoint in the \u03b1 plot [Fig. 5(b)] is shown on an expanded\nscale in the inset. From this figure, it is clear that \u03b1\u0307 has\na positive slope at k, though of small magnitude while\nat a, it has a value -9.7. The latter is close to the natural (negative) slope of \u03b1 when it begins the descending\nbranch of the sinusoidal form. On the other hand, the\nslope of \u03b1 is positive at k and hence will not allow the\ngrowth to change over from a jumping mode to the sinusoidal growth form for \u03b1. One can note that the slopes\nat points of all the earlier visits to AB [see Fig. 5(b)\ninset] keep decreasing till the slope becomes negative required for the monotonically decreasing trend of \u03b1. This\nis exactly the same mechanism for I = 10\u22122 and V = 1\nalso, for the low v branch, except that in this case, even\nthe sign of the slope is incompatible for all the points\nprior to a in Fig. 5 c. The mechanism operating on CD\n(i.e., at the switching from jumping mode to monotonically decreasing nature of F ) is essentially the same but\narguments are a little more involved and hence they are\nnot presented.\nNow, we consider the causes leading to the maximum\nand minimum values taken by F being much more than\npermitted by f (v, V ). As this is dominant for V = 4,\nwe illustrate this using Fig. 5(a) and 5(c). We first note\nthat Eq. (10) constrains the dynamically changing values of F (t) and \u03b1(t) to the stationary values of f (v, V ).\nClearly, this implies that F = f (v, V )/(1 + sin\u03b1). A\nrough estimate of Fmax can be obtained by Fmax \u223c\nfmax /(1+\u03b1min ) with Fmin determined by \u03b1max . This relation can be easily verified by using the numerical values\nof \u03b1. For instance, for V = 4 and I = 10\u22122 , \u03b1min = \u22120.3\nand fmax = 307. This gives Fmax = 438 while the numerical value from the phase plot for this case gives 433\nwhich is very close. Similarly, using \u03b1max = 0.62 and\nfmin = 293, we get Fmin = 181 which compares well\nwith the numerical value of 180. We have verified this\nrelation is respected for various values of V and I.

We have carried out a study of the\ndynamics of an adhesive roller tape using a differentialalgebraic scheme used for singular set of differential equations. The algorithm produces stick-slip jumps across the\ntwo dissipative branches as a consequence of the inherent dynamics. Our extensive simulations show that the\ndynamics is much richer than anticipated earlier. In particular the influence of inertia is shown to be dramatic.\nFor instance, even at low inertia, for small values of V ,\nthe influence of inertia manifests with jumps of the orbit\noccurring even before F reaches fmax (or fmin ) which\nis quite unexpected. More dominant is its influence for\nhigh I both for low V and high V , though it is striking\nfor the latter case. Following the reasoning used in the\nPLC effect, we introduce a dynamized curve f (v, V ) as\nresulting from competing time scales of internal relaxation and imposed pull speed. The modified peel force\nfunction leads to the decreasing trend in the magnitude\nof \u2206F with increasing pull velocity, a feature observed in\nexperiments. We have also recaptured the essential features of the dynamics by a set of approximations valid in\ndifferent regimes of the parameter space. These approximate solutions illustrate the influence of various time\nscales such as that due to inertia, the elasticity of the\ntape and that determined by the stationary peel force\nf (v, V ). We also find the unusual canard type of solutions.\nHere, it is worthwhile to comment on the dynamical\nfeatures of the model. The numerical results themselves\nare too complex to understand. A striking example of\nthis is the series of force drops seen on the descending\nbranch of the pull force [Fig. 4(c)]. This result is hard\nto understand as it would amount to a partial relaxation\n\nof the pull force. However, a partial relaxation is only\npossible in the presence of another competing time scale\n(other than the imposed time scale). Another example is\nthe jumping of the orbit for low I case, from AB to CB\nand vice versa even before the pull force reaches the extremum values of f (v, V ). For this reason, we have undertaken to make this complex dynamics transparent using\na set of approximations. The basic idea here is to solve a\nsingle equation (or at most two equations as in the high\nI and V case) which incorporates all the relevant time\nscales. This method not only captures all the results to\nwithin 10% error but it also clearly brings out the regimes\nof parameter space where these time scales become important. This analysis also shows that the time scale due\nto inertia of the roller tape shows up even for low I which\ncomes as a surprise as one expects that for low inertia,\nthe orbit should stick to the stationary peel function.\n(Recall that for low inertia, equations have been approximated by Lienard type of equations by Maugis and Barquins [1].) Our approximate equations demonstrate that\na crucial role in inducing the jumps even at low inertia is\nplayed by the high frequency oscillations resulting from\nthe inertia of the roller tape. As for high inertia (both\nfor low and high pull velocities), the time scale due to\ninertia is responsible for the partial relaxation of F as\nshown.\nA few comments may be in order on the bursting type\nof oscillations in the peel velocity. Bursting type of oscillatory behavior are commonly seen in neuro-biological\nsystems [25]. Conventionally, bursting type oscillations\narise in the presence of homoclinic orbit [25]. Such bursting type of oscillations have also been modeled using one\ndimensional map [26]. However, it is clear that the mechanism for bursting type of oscillations in our case is different. In our case, this arises due to the fact that the\norbit is forced to jump between the stable manifolds as\na result of competing time scale of inertia and the time\nscale for the evolution of v. (We note that the latter itself\nincludes more than one time scale [see Eq. (21)], namely\nthe contribution from the slopes of the stable parts of the\nstationary curve f (v, V ) and that due to elasticity of the\ntape. ) The bunching of the spikes in v is the result of\nf (v, V ) becoming flat for large V and I. One other comment relates to canard type solutions. Figure 7 shows\none such solution. As mentioned, these type solutions\narise from sticking to the unstable manifold. In fact, a\nsimilar type of solution is seen in Fig. 5(c). As noted earlier, all the jumps from CD to AB or vice versa always\noccur when the peel velocity reaches the limiting value\nwhere f \u2032 (v, V ) = 0. However, it can be seen from this\nfigure, the orbit starting from c monotonically decreases\nwell into the unstable part of f . Thus, this solution also\nhas the features of canards. It must be stated that our\napproximate solutions cannot capture the behavior of canards.\nFinally, the results presented in this paper are on the\nnature of dynamics of the model equations which so far\nhad defied solution. However, comparison with exper-\n\n\f13\niments has been minimal largely due to the paucity of\nquantitative experimental findings as stated earlier. Our\nanalysis shows that the model predicts periodic, sawtooth [1], as well as chaotic solutions as reported in [3].\nThe high magnitude of the Lyapunov exponents for the\nchaotic solutions in the low pull velocities is consistent\nwith that reported earlier [3]. We note that the other\nquantitative experimental feature reported by Refs.[1, 3]\nis the decreasing trend of the average force drop magnitudes as a function of the pull velocity is also captured by\nour model (Fig. 6), a result that holds for both low and\nhigh inertia. This result is a direct consequence of the\ndynamization of the peel force function, i.e., dependence\nof the peel force on the pull velocity. We note here that\nthe complex dynamics at high velocities (see Fig. 5) is\na direct result of the unstable part of dynamized curve,\nf (v, V ), shrinking to zero. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is first time the result in Fig. 6 has been explained.\nAs the hypothesis of dynamization captures the decreasing trend of the force drops, it also suggests that the\n\n[1] D.
