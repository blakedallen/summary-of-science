It is natural to interpret these objects as localized solutions of the semiclassical Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation [2]. Correspondingly,\nthe means to create DS, employed so far, required a\nmacroscopic classical perturbation applied to the atomic\ncloud. An example of the latter is the phase imprinting\ntechnique [3], where a finite fraction of the 1D atomic\ncloud is subject to an external potential for a certain\ntime. Once the potential is switched off and the gas is\nallowed to evolve, the DS is formed around the place with\nthe maximal gradient of the potential.\nDrawing an analogy with the electronic field-emission\nfrom a metal: a pulse of a strong external electric field\nmay lead to creation of free electrons outside of the metal\nsurface. It is well-known, however, from the time of von\nLenard and Einstein [4, 5] that this is not the only way\nto excite electrons. Indeed, a weak ac field results in a\nphotoelectric current, as long as the energy of its quanta\nexceeds the threshold given by the work function of the\nmetal. The difference between the field-emission and the\nphotoelectric effects is that the latter essentially utilizes\nthe quantum nature of the electromagnetic radiation. Is\nthere an analog of the photoelectric effect for excitation of\nDS? Namely can the DS be created by a weak ac radiation\nwith the frequency exceeding a certain threshold?\nIn the framework of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation the\nanswer on these questions is negative. Indeed, a weak external field may lead to excitation of the linear waves, if\nits wavenumber and frequency satisfy Bogoliubov disper-\n\n\u2217 Current address: Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY\n11974\n\nsion relation, but not to creation of DS. However, treating\nthe Bose liquid beyond the semiclassical Gross-Pitaevskii\napproximation reveals that creation of DS in response\non an absorption of a single quanta with an above-thethreshold energy is actually possible. In analogy with the\nphotoelectric effect we call this phenomenon the photosolitonic effect. The threshold energy is given by the\nenergy of DS \u03b5s (p) with the momentum p = ~q, where q\nis the photon wavenumber. Creation of DS requires an\nac field with frequency ~\u03c9 > \u03b5s (p). Notice that no comparison of the external frequency \u03c9 and the DS energy \u03b5s\never appears in the Gross-Pitaevskii treatment.\nConsider 1D Bose liquid subject to an external ac potential with the wavenumber q and frequency \u03c9. Such\na radiation may be created using Bragg scattering technique [6, 7]. In these experiments the ac potential has\nbeen created by the interference pattern of two noncollinear optical beams with the differential frequency\n\u03c9 and the x-component of the differential wavevector q,\n[8]. At zero temperature, according to the fluctuationdissipation theorem, the probability to absorb the radiation is given by the dynamic structure factor (DSF),\ndefined as the density-density correlation function\nZ\nS(q, \u03c9) = dxdt ei(qx\u2212\u03c9t) h\u03c1(x, t)\u03c1(0, 0)i ,\n(1)\nwhere \u03c1(x, t) is the density operator. Rewriting DSF in\nthe Lehman representation in terms of exact many-body\neigenstates of the system |ni with energies \u01ebn , one finds\nX\nS(q, \u03c9) =\n|hn|\u03c1q |0i|2 \u03b4(\u01ebn \u2212 \u01eb0 \u2212 ~\u03c9) ,\n(2)\nn\n\nwhere \u03c1q is the Fourier component of the density and n =\n0 corresponds to the ground state. Since the momentum\nis a good quantum number, only the many-body states\nwith the total momentum p = ~q contribute to the sum\nin the r.h.s. of Eq. (2).\nFor the model with the short-range repulsive interactions the many-body spectrum has been evaluated exactly using the Bethe ansatz (BA) method [9]. Lieb\n\n\f2\nhas identified two characteristic modes in the excitation\nspectrum of the model[9], known as Lieb I and II modes\nwith the dispersion relations \u03b51,2 (p), Fig. 1. The two are\ngiven correspondingly by the particle and hole excitations in the set of the BA quasi-momenta. The hole-like\nmode \u03b52 (p) is shown to be the lower bound of the manybody spectrum with a given momentum p. According to\nEq. (2) absorption is only possible if ~\u03c9 > \u03b52 (~q). Employing a numerical implementation of the algebraic BA\n[10], Caux and Calabrese [11] have shown that DSF is\nindeed non-zero for all energies in excess of \u03b52 (~q) and\nis peaked at the particle-like mode ~\u03c9 = \u03b51 (~q). In the\nlimit of the weakly interacting gas the latter approaches\nthe Bogoliubov dispersion relation [9, 12]\np\n\u03b51 (~q) \u2192 ~\u03c9B (q) = vB ~q 1 + (~q/2mvB )2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere vB is the Bogoliubov sound velocity and m is the\nboson mass.\nThis observation offers a way to interpret absorption\nin a vicinity of the Lieb I mode, \u03b51 (p), in terms of\nweakly interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Consider,\ne.g., a photon with some wave vector q and energy ~\u03c9\nslightly below the value \u03b51 (~q), i.e., ~\u03c9 . \u03b51 (~q), see\npoint A in Fig. 1(a). The energy and momentum conservation laws allow for such photon to create two Bogoliubov quasiparticles, ~\u03c9 = \u03b51 (~q \u2212 p) + \u03b51 (p). In\n2\nthe limit \u03b51 (~q) \u2212 ~\u03c9 \u226a mvB\n, one of the two particles has small momentum and may be viewed as a \"soft\"\nphonon. For smaller initial photon energies, the resulting two quasiparticles split the photon momentum more\nevenly, until the photon energy reaches the limiting value\n~\u03c9 = 2\u03b51 (~q/2). If the photon energy is decreased below\nthis threshold, a creation of more than two quasiparticles\nis needed to satisfy the conservation laws. Upon further\nlowering ~\u03c9, more quasiparticles are created in the process of photon absorption. Once the photon energy ~\u03c9\napproaches the line \u03b5 = vB ~q, Fig. 1, the energy and momentum of the absorbed photon is split between infinitely\nmany soft phonons.\nBelow this line the described process of dividing the\nenergy and momentum between the quasiparticles does\nnot work any more. Nevertheless the many-body spectrum persists down to the lower value \u03b52 (~q) < vB ~q\nand the algebraic BA calculations [11] show that there is\na finite absorption probability in the energy window\n\u03b52 (~q) < ~\u03c9 < vB ~q .\n\n(4)\n\nWhat is the absorption mechanism in this window, where\nthe conservation laws forbid excitation of any number of\nquasiparticles or phonons?\nThe clue to answer this question appeared in the 1976\npaper of Kulish, Manakov and Faddeev [13], who noticed\nthat the hole-like Lieb II mode approaches dispersion relation of DS in the weakly interacting limit\n\u03b52 (p) \u2192 \u03b5s (p) .\n\n(5)\n\nH\n!Z\n\nH1\n\n0\n\nH\n\nH1\n\nv B !q\n\nH2\n\np\n\n2S !n\n\n!q\u0010 p ! q\n\np\n(b)\n\nH1\n\nv B !q\n\nB\n\n!Z\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\nA\n\nH2\n\np\u0010 ! q p\u000e 2S !n\n\np\n\nFIG. 1: Momentum\u2013energy plane for excitations. A photon\nis represented by a solid dot. (a) Absorption of a photon (dot\nmarked by A) with energy and momentum slightly below the\nquasiparticle spectrum \u03b51 (p), leads predominantly to creation\nof two quasiparticles with momenta q \u2212 p and p (the latter\nis determined by the shown geometrical construction). As A\napproaches the line \u03b5 = vB p, the number of excited quasiparticles increases. (b) Once photon energy-momentum (dot\nmarked B) fall below the line \u03b5 = vB p, its absorption involves\ncreation of a soliton. Other excitations created in the course\nof absorption may be treated as phonons if B is close to the\nboundary \u03b52 (p). The shown \"sound cone\" with Bogoliubov\nvelocity vB determines the range of possible momenta of a\ngenerated dark soliton, p\u2212 < ps < p+ .\n\nIt means that the many-body states with the energy in\nthe vicinity of \u03b52 must be viewed as quantized DS particles. Correspondingly the photon absorption in the energy window (4) necessarily involves excitation of DS\nalong with Bogoliubov quasiparticles and/or phonons.\nConsider e.g. a photon with the energy immediately\n2\nabove the Lieb II mode, \u03b52 < ~\u03c9 . \u03b52 + mvB\n(point\nB in Fig. 1 (b)). Drawing the \"sound cone\" with the\nslope vB down to the intersections with \u03b52 (p), one finds\nthe range of the possible momenta of DS\np\u2212 < ps < p+ ,\n\np\u2213 = p\u2213 (q, \u03c9)\n\n(6)\n\nwhich satisfy the conservation laws. Indeed, DS with the\nmomentum p\u2212 accompanied by a phonon, propagating\nin the direction of the external momentum ~q, obviously\n\n\f3\nsatisfies the energy and momentum conservation. Similarly, DS with the momentum p+ must be accompanied\nby the counter-propagating phonon. Any other soliton\nfrom the momentum window (6) requires excitation of a\ncertain superposition of the forward and backward propagating phonons.\nIn this paper we evaluate probability Wq\u03c9 (ps ) to excite DS with the momentum ps in the range (6) upon\nabsorption of a photon with the wavenumber q and frequency \u03c9 \u2265 \u03b52 (~q)/~. We show that such a probability\nis heavily shifted towards the lower boundary of the interval ps = p\u2212 (q, \u03c9), i.e. DS is preferentially excited\nalong with the forward moving phonon. At larger photon energies, while still in the interval (4), DS is excited\nwith highest probability along with the forward moving Bogoliubov quasiparticle. Its energy and momentum may be found geometrically by plotting the replica\nof the Bogoliubov dispersion curve which starts at some\npoint along the Lieb II mode, \u03b52 (p), and passes through\nthe point (~q, ~\u03c9) representing external photon. We also\nshow that the total probability to excite any DS scales as\na\nfrom the energy threshold,\nR power of the blue detuning\ndps Wq\u03c9 (ps ) \u221d (~\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b52 )\u03bc2 . The exponent \u03bc2 = \u03bc2 (q)\nis a function of photon wavenumber and the strength of\ninteractions between the bosons. In the relevant limit of\nthe weakly interacting gas, the exponent is large \u03bc2 \u226b 1,\nsignifying the relative smallness of the photo-solitonic effect. As we explain below, such a smallness is associated with the quantum orthogonality catastrophe phenomenon [14].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II we reproduce a derivation of DS solution of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation to introduce notations and terminology. In section III we evaluate the probability to\nexcite a specific DS upon absorption of a photon. Section\nIV is devoted to evaluation and discussion of DSF i.e. the\ntotal photon absorption rate, resulting in DS formation.\nFinally in section V we discuss ways to observe the effect\nexperimentally along with the limitations of our theory.\nII.\n\nDARK SOLITONS\n\nTo establish notations let us briefly discuss the\nlocalized solutions of the non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation[15]. Quasiclassically, this equation is obeyed\nby the condensate wave function:\n\u0001\n1 2\ni\u2202t \u03a8 +\n(7)\n\u2202 \u03a8 + c n \u2212 |\u03a8|2 \u03a8 = 0 ,\n2m x\n\nwhere n = N/L is the average concentration and L is the\nlength of the system. Hereinafter we switch to the units\nwith ~ = 1. The interaction strength c determines [9]\nthe dimensionless parameter \u03b3 = mc/n whose smallness\n\u03b3 \u226a 1 is the criterion of the weak interaction.\nLooking for a localized solution traveling with a certain\nvelocity vs , one substitutes\n\u221a\n(8)\n\u03a8(x, t) = \u03a8s (x \u2212 vs t) = n \u03c7 ei\u03b8\n\nin Eq. (7) and finds two equations for the phase \u03b8(\u03be) and\nthe normalized amplitude \u03c7(\u03be), which are functions of\n\u03be = x \u2212 vs t.

Using the fact that far from the soliton \u03c7(\u00b1\u221e) = 1 and\n\u03b8 \u2032 (\u00b1\u221e) = 0, one finds \u03b8 \u2032 = mvs (1 \u2212 1/\u03c72 ).

In a vicinity\nof \u03c7 = 1 the potential (11) may be approximated as U \u2248\n2\n2m2 (vs2 \u2212 vB\n)(1 \u2212 \u03c7)2 and therefore the small oscillation\nsolutions\np have the form \u03c7 \u2212 1 \u223c cos(q(x \u2212 vs t)) with\n2 . Rewriting the last expression as v =\nq =p2m vs2 \u2212 vB\ns\nvB 1 + (q/2mvB )2 , one may recognize it as the phase\nvelocity of the Bogoliubov mode. Correspondingly, the\noscillation frequency qvs = \u03c9B (q) coincides with Eq. (3).\nWe thus conclude that the only solutions of GP equation\nwhich travel with a supersonic velocity are Bogoliubov\nquasiparticles.\nThe situation is more interesting for vs < vB . In this\ncase the potential (11) exhibits a maximum at \u03c7 = 1, a\nminimum at a smaller amplitude and a turning point at\n\u03c7 = vs /vB < 1. The solution with the proper boundary conditions, \u03c7(\u00b1\u221e) = 1, is a trajectory which stays\n\n\f4\nat the maximum and then exhibits a bounce down to\nthe turning point and back to the maximum. This is\nthe DS solution. To find it analytically, one may notice\nthat Eq.

Although this does not change the energy of\nthe system in the thermodynamic limit (indeed the corresponding contribution to the energy scales as n\u03b8s2 /(mL)),\nit produces a finite contribution n\u03b8s to the momentum.\nAs a result the total (core plus the rest of the condensate)\nmomentum of the DS state is\nps = psc + n\u03b8s = n (\u03b8s \u2212 sin \u03b8s ) .\n\n(19)\n\nEquations (17) and (19) give an implicit form of DS dispersion relation \u03b5s (ps ). The maximum of the soliton energy corresponds to \u03b8s = \u03c0, where both the soliton velocity and core momentum vanish vs = psc = 0. The\ntotal momentum, however, is finite ps = \u03c0n and is uniformly spread across the entire condensate. This is the\ntrue DS, in a sense that the density vanishes in its center and the particle depletion reaches its maximal value\nNs = 2K/\u03c0. Away from the point \u03b8s = \u03c0 soliton's velocity is finite vs 6= 0 as well as the density at any point.\nBecause of the latter such solitons are sometimes called\ngrey. Their velocity approaches sound velocity vB when\nthe total momentum approaches zero or 2\u03c0n, while the\nenergy and Ns both decrease. Clearly the concept of the\nclassical soliton looses sense when the number of particles\npushed away from the core is comparable to one, Ns . 1.\nThis takes place when \u03b8s . 1/K \u226a 1, and therefore at\n|ps | . n/K 3 , and in intervals of the same width around\nthe point p = 2\u03c0n.\nIn the limit of the weak interactions \u03b3 \u226a 1 (i.e.\nK \u226b 1) the DS dispersion relation given by Eqs. (17),\n(19), approaches the Lieb II mode, plotted in Fig. 1. The\nconvergence is not uniform and the two significantly deviate from each other in the narrow intervals of momenta\nnear zero |ps | . nK \u22123/2 and similarly near 2\u03c0n [17]. Notice that at the boundaries of this interval the number of\nparticles\n\u221a pushed away from the soliton core is still large\nNs \u2248 K > 1. It is this condition, rather than the\nweaker one Ns & 1, which determines the validity of the\nsoliton approach. We shall return to this observation in\nsection IV.\n\nIII.\n\nEXCITATION OF DARK SOLITONS\n\nConsider a Bose gas subject to a weak space and time\ndependent external potential V0 cos(qx \u2212 \u03c9t). According\nto the Golden Rule (c.f. Eq. (2)), the system may absorb\nquanta of this field if its many-body spectrum possesses\nexcited states with the momentum q and energy \u03c9. It follows from the exactly solvable model [9] that such states\nform a continuum whose energy is bound from below by\nthe Lieb II mode \u03b52 (q). As argued in the Introduction\nabsorption of quanta with the energy in the range given\nby Eq. (4) is associated with creation of DS along with\nthe phonons or quasiparticles.\nTo evaluate the probability of such a process it is convenient to think of it in terms of the space-time evolution of\n\n\f5\na state resulting from the photon absorption by the system initially in the ground state. To this end we notice\nthat the photon absorption first creates a virtual state of\nthe condensate with a local perturbation of the condensate wavefunction. Since the photon carries momentum\nq and no extra particles, so does the initial local perturbation. Subsequently this perturbation evolves and\neventually takes a form of a superposition of real excitations, i.e. conserving overall energy \u03c9 in addition to the\nmomentum q. We expect that such a final state contains\na soliton with the momentum ps \u2248 q and core energy\n\u03b5s (ps ) < \u03c9. The small excess energy \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5s > 0 is carried\naway by phonons, propagating with the sound velocity\nvB .\nThe initial separation of the soliton core from a bunch\nof phonons takes a short time, which may be estimated\nas \u03c4s = ls /vB . The soliton core is the density depletion,\nwhich carries momentum \u2212n sin \u03b8s (which is very different from ps \u2248 q) and \u2212Ns particles. At times t > \u03c4s the\ncore propagates without dispersion and behaves as a free\nparticle with the energy \u03b5s . The remaining momentum\nq + n sin \u03b8s \u2248 ps + n sin \u03b8s = n\u03b8s , cf. Eq. (19), and Ns\nparticles, initially localized on a scale \u223c ls , must be carried away and spread over the entire system at t \u226b \u03c4s by\nthe phonons. As explained above, despite the fact that\nthe phonons must carry away large number of particles\nNs and large momentum n\u03b8s , their final energy is small,\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5s \u226a vB n\u03b8s . Therefore this is the low-probability\nevent, or the \"under-barrier\" process, which should be\ndescribed as the imaginary time evolution [18, 19] of the\nphonon system [20].\nTo develop such a description we start from the imaginary time \u03c4 action for the interacting Bose field\n\u0015\n\u0014\nc\n1\n|\u2202x \u03a8|2 + cn|\u03a8|2 \u2212 |\u03a8|4 .\nd\u03c4 dx \u03a8\u0304\u2202\u03c4 \u03a8 \u2212\n2m\n2\n(20)\nIt is convenient\nto\nparameterize\nthe\ncomplex\nfield\nas\np\n\u03a8 =\nn + (\u2202x \u03c6/\u03c0) ei\u03b8 , where \u03c6(x, \u03c4 ) and \u03b8(x, \u03c4 ) are\ntwo real fields describing density and phase fluctuations\ncorrespondingly. Assuming small density fluctuations\n\u2202x \u03c6 \u226a \u03c0n and linearizing the resulting action, one finds\nS=\n\nZ\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\ni\nd\u03c4\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\ndx \u2202x \u03c6 \u2202\u03c4 \u03b8 \u2212 Hsw ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the hydrodynamic Hamiltonian of the sound waves\nis given by [21]\nHsw =\n\nvB\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndx K \u22121 (\u2202x \u03c6)2 + K(\u2202x \u03b8)2 .\n\n(22)\n\nWe have omitted terms \u223c (\u2202x2 \u03c6)2 in the Hamiltonian,\nwhich is equivalent to restricting the spectrum of Bogoliubov quasiparticles to the phonon branch only. This approximation is sufficient for treating photon absorption\nclose to the soliton threshold.\nTaking the variations of the imaginary-time action over\n\n\u03c6 and \u03b8, one finds the semiclassical equations of motion\n\u2202\u03c42x \u03c6 + ivB K\u2202x2 \u03b8 = \u03c0Ns [\u03b4(x)\u03b4(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u0304)\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 )] ,\nvB 2\n\u2202\u03c42x \u03b8 + i\n\u2202 \u03c6 = \u03b8s [\u03b4(x)\u03b4(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u0304)\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 )] .\nK x\nThe right hand sides of these equations contain sources\nwhich describe the feedback of DS creation at the point\nx = \u03c4 = 0 and its subsequent destruction at the point\nx = x\u0304, \u03c4 = \u03c4\u0304 . As discussed above, such creation (destruction) of DS is associated with practically instantaneous\nand local injection (removal) of Ns particles and momentum n\u03b8s into (out of) the phonon modes. The sources\non the r.h.s. of the equations of motion do just that.\nThe equations of motions are straightforwardly solved\nby the Fourier transformation. Substituting such a solution back into Eq.

(16) in the last equality in the r.h.s.\nof Eq. (24). Here \u03b8s is the parameter of a created DS, it\nis related to the DS momentum ps \u2248 q through Eq. (19).\nThe soliton length ls appears in Eq. (23) as a short distance cutoff. Indeed, one should understand that the actual spatial (temporal) extent of the delta-functions on\nthe r.h.s. of the equations of motions is the soliton size\nls (\u03c4s = ls /vB ).\nTo find a probability of creating DS with the momentum ps upon absorbing a photon (q, \u03c9), one needs to\nevaluate the Fourier transform of the square of the semiclassical matrix element given by e\u2212S . Specifically,\nZ\ndx\u0304 dt\u0304 \u2212S(x\u0304,t\u0304)\u2212i(q\u2212ps )x\u0304+i(\u03c9\u2212\u03b5s )t\u0304\nWq,\u03c9 (ps ) = Re\ne\n, (25)\nls\nwhere we took into account that the momentum ps and\nenergy \u03b5s (ps ) are carried away by the soliton and therefore should not be absorbed by the phonons. The analytical continuation performed in Eq.

One may therefore expand the soliton energy as\n\u03b5s (ps ) \u2248 \u03b5s (q) + (ps \u2212 q)vs and find for the boundaries of\nthe possible soliton momenta, see Eq.

The corresponding exponents\n(\u03bc\u00b1 \u22121), see Fig. 4 (b), are functions of the soliton parameter \u03b8s = \u03b8s (q) and the quantum parameter K as given\nby Eq. (24). Since \u03bc\u2212 < \u03bc+ , the probability to excite the\nsoliton is heavily shifted towards the lower boundary p\u2212 ,\nFig. 4(a).

Pustilnik in Ref. [22]. There a\nmapping between 1d Bose and Fermi systems was used\nto prove the presence of the power law non-analyticity\nand evaluate the exponent \u03bc2 (q). However, the method\nadopted there allowed us to deduce the exponent only\nin the limit of strongly interacting bosons \u03b3 \u226b 1 (since\nthe latter is mapped onto weakly interacting fermions,\ntreated in Ref. [23]). Later a method to extract the edge\nexponent \u03bc2 for an arbitrary interaction parameter from\nthe BA solution was suggested in Refs. [24, 25, 26].\nFig. 5 shows comparison between the semiclassical result Eq. (29) and the numerical solution of BA equations\n[24] for the edge exponent \u03bc2 as a function of the momentum (in units of n). The agreement between the two\napproaches becomes progressively better for weaker interactions (the only limit where the soliton picture holds,\nsee Introduction). Such an agreement suggests that the\ninterpretation of the photon absorption near the lower\nspectral edge as a formation of solitons is indeed consistent with a fully quantum many-body calculation. The\nlatter [24] does not rely on existence of solitons at all.\nWe consider it as a strong confirmation of the thesis that\nabsorption of an ac quanta in the frequency window (4)\nresults in the formation of DS.\nNotice that even in the weakly interacting limit, the\nsemiclassical prediction (29) deviates from the exact one\nat very small momenta, see the inset in Fig. 5(a).

(27), i.e., solitons with the momentum in\nthe interval ps \u00b1 dps /2, where ps belongs to the window\n(6), are created with the rate Wq,\u03c9 (ps )V02 dps .\nAn important question is what are the corresponding\nrates for a larger energy of the photon: \u03b5s +\u039b < \u03c9 < vB q.\nAccording to the arguments given in the Introduction,\nabsorption of such a photon should necessarily lead to\nDS formation. Yet our calculations are not directly applicable in this case. Indeed, we have used linearized\ndispersion relation for the quasiparticles (phonons) excited along with DS. For energies above \u03b5s + \u039b such an\napproximation is not valid. This is because Bogoliubov\nquasiparticles with momenta above mvB that take the\nexcess energy can not be well approximated by phonons.\nThe photon absorption is dominated by creation of a DS\nand single quasiparticle moving in the direction of the\nwavevector q (i.e. moving forward). Thus the parameters\nof the typical DS may be found by plotting a replica of\nthe Bogoliubov spectra which starts at some point along\nthe absorption edge \u03b5 = \u03b5s (q) and passes through (q, \u03c9).\nThe starting point prescribes DS momentum and energy.\nWe expect that the power-law Eq. (30) saturates at an\nexcess energy of order \u039b(q), i.e. at \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b52 \u2248 \u039b. As a result, DS formation rate per unit length may be estimated\nas (V02 /~2 vB )e\u2212\u03b1\u03bc2 (q) , with a numerical factor \u03b1 \u2248 1.\nRecalling that for a true DS \u03bc2 = 0.7K = 1.1Ns ,\none realizes that the photo-solitonic rate is exponentially suppressed with the increase of DS depleted particle number Ns . Physically the origin of this smallness is\nin the orthogonality phenomenon: the state of the system immediately after absorption of the photon is almost orthogonal to the state with the soliton causing a\nre-distribution of density and phase of the condensate\nin the one-dimensional system. The corresponding matrix element is exponentially small in the parameter Ns .\nThis fact dictates a rather stringent limitations on the\nexperimental observability of the photo-solitonic effect.\nIncreasing interactions (i.e. decreasing K) makes the exponential factor in the photo-solitonic rate less severe, on\nthe other hand it simultaneously decreases Ns , making\nit more difficult to observe the excited solitons. Assuming V0 /(2\u03c0~) = 100 Hz, Ref. [7] we estimate the soliton\n\n\f8\nproduction rate for the relatively \"light\" solitons with\nNs = 10 as 1 event per Bragg pulse of duration of 2\nseconds.\n\ndiscussions.
