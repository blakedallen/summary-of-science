This is a higher dimensional analogue of the HermiteMinkowski theorem. We also refer to the case of varieties over finite\nfields. As an application, we prove certain finiteness results of representations of the fundamental groups over algebraically closed fields.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Hermite-Minkowski theorem is a remarkable result in algebraic number\ntheory. It says that for a number field F and a finite set S of primes of\nF , there exist only finitely many extensions of F unramified outside S with\ngiven degree. By Galois theory we can interpret the theorem as the smallness\nof the Galois group GF,S of the maximal Galois extension of F unramified\noutside S. In general, a profinite group is said to be small if there exist only\nfinitely many open subgroups of the group of given index. Our main results\nare the smallness of \u00e9tale fundamental groups for some arithmetic schemes\nas follows.\nTheorem (Th. 2.9). Let X be a connected scheme of finite type and dominant1 over the ring of integers Z. Then the \u00e9tale fundamental group \u03c01 (X) is\nsmall. Equivalently, there exist only finitely many \u00e9tale coverings of X with\ngiven degree.\n\u2217\n\nThe first author is supported by the JSPS Fellowships for Young Scientists. The\nsecond author is partially supported by GCOE, Kyoto University.\n1\nIn this paper we say that a morphism f : X \u2192 Y is dominant if f (X \u2032 ) is dense in Y\nfor any irreducible component X \u2032 of X.\n\n1\n\n\fOn the contrary, non-complete varieties over a finite field, even function\nfields over a finite field in one variable with characteristic p > 0 have so\nmany finite extensions that the Hermite-Minkowski theorem no longer holds.\nIn fact, the Artin-Schreier equations produce infinitely many extensions of\ndegree p which ramify only at a place. Thus one can hope for the finiteness\nonly for extensions of bounded degree with extra conditions, for example,\nfixing discriminants (see [6], Sect. 8.23). In Section 3, we use the fundamental groups with restricted ramification instead of discriminants. More\nprecisely, we introduce a certain quotient \u03c01 (X, m) of the \u00e9tale fundamental group \u03c01 (X). It classifies \u00e9tale coverings of X which allow ramification\nalong the boundary according to a given modulus m. Here, the modulus m\nis a collection of moduli associated with curves on X. These coverings have\nthe advantage that they are stable under base change, while coverings with\nrestricted ramification dealt in [11] are not. We examine the smallness of the\nfundamental group with restricted ramification for varieties over a finite field\nas follows.\nTheorem (Th. 3.6). Let X be a connected variety over a finite field k.\nAssume that there exist an \u00e9tale morphism X \u2032 \u2192 X and a proper morphism\nX \u2032 \u2192 Z, where Z is a curve over k. Then \u03c01 (X, m) is small for any modulus\nm on X.\nAs an application, in Section 4 we prove certain finiteness results of representations of the fundamental groups with restricted ramification over an\nalgebraically closed field.\nAfter writing up this paper, it was pointed out by Professor Y. Taguchi\nthat one of our main theorems (Th. 2.9) has been proved by G. Faltings\n([4], Chap. VI, Sect. 2) assuming the scheme X is affine and smooth over Z.\nHowever there is only a sketch of the proof, and our proof is more systematic\nand simpler than his by virtue of Lemma 2.7. Thus we think that it is\nindispensable to leave Theorem 2.9 in this paper.\nThroughout this paper, a number field is a finite extension field of the\nrational number field Q. We denote by OF the ring of integers of a number\nfield F . For any field K, we denote by K a separable closure of K and by\nGK the absolute Galois group Gal(K/K) of K.\nAcknowledgments.

First, we interpret the\nHermite-Minkowski theorem as the smallness of a Galois group as follows.\nDefinition 2.1 (cf. [5], Sect. 16.10, or of type (F) in Sect. 4.1 of [19]). A\nprofinite group G is said to be small if there exist only finitely many open\nnormal subgroups H with (G : H) \u2264 n for any positive integer n.\nFor a number field F , the Galois group GF,S of the maximal Galois extension of F unramified outside S is small, where S is a finite set of primes\nof F . This fact is nothing other than the Hermite-Minkowski theorem.\nRemark 2.2. The notion of a small profinite group is used in another meaning in [17]. These two notions are quite different. For example, a direct\nproduct of countably many Z/nZ is small in the sense of op. cit., and it is\nnot small in our meaning. In general, any countably-based profinite group is\nsmall in the sense of op. cit.\nProposition 2.3 (cf. [19], Chap. III, Sect. 4.1, Prop. 8). Let G be a profinite\ngroup. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) G is small.\n(i\u2032 ) There exist only finitely many open subgroups H with (G : H) \u2264 n for\nany positive integer n.\n(ii) For every finite G-group A, H 1 (G, A) is a finite set.\n(ii\u2032 ) For every finite group A, the set of continuous homomorphisms Hom(G, A)\nis a finite set.\nSecondly, we list basic properties of small profinite groups.\n\n3\n\n\fProposition 2.4 (cf. [5], Sect. 16.10). Let G be a profinite group.\n(i) If N is an open subgroup of G, then G is small if and only if N is small.\n(ii) If G is small and N is a closed normal subgroup of G, then the quotient\ngroup G/N is small.\n(iii) If G is topologically finitely generated, then G is small.\nLemma 2.5. If G and G\u2032 are small profinite groups, then their free product\nG \u2217 G\u2032 is also small.\nProof. For any finite group A, there is a bijection\nHom(G \u2217 G\u2032 , A) \u2192 Hom(G, A) \u00d7 Hom(G\u2032 , A)\nwhich maps f : G \u2217 G\u2032 \u2192 A to the pair (f |G , f |G\u2032 ), where f |G and f |G\u2032 are the\nrestrictions of f to G and G\u2032 respectively. Hence we have the assertion.\nThe following lemma, Lemma 2.7 is a profinite group version of Lemma\n5 in [25]. We can prove it by the same method, namely by employing the\ntheory of \"variety of groups\". Here we prove this by purely profinite group\ntheoretic argument. This proof is due to Professor M. Matsumoto. First we\nprove a lemma, which is crucial for the proof of Lemma 2.7.\n\u03c6\n\nLemma 2.6. Let 1 \u2192 G\u2032 \u2192 G \u2212\n\u2192 G\u2032\u2032 \u2192 1 be an exact sequence of profinite\ngroups, where G\u2032 is a finite group and G\u2032\u2032 is a small profinite group. For any\npositive integer n there exist only finitely many open normal subgroups N of\nG with (G : N) \u2264 n and G\u2032 \u2229 N = 1.\nProof. For any positive integer n, let Sn be the set of open normal subgroups\nN of G (we write it as N \u2701G) with (G : N) \u2264 n. For N \u2208 Sn with N \u2229G\u2032 = 1,\nthe restriction \u03c6|N : N \u2192 \u03c6(N) of \u03c6 is an isomorphism and we have (G\u2032\u2032 :\n\u03c6(N)) \u2264 n. Let N \u2032\u2032 be an open normal subgroup of G\u2032\u2032 with (G\u2032\u2032 : N \u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 n.\nBy the smallness of G\u2032\u2032 , it is sufficient to prove the finiteness of the set S\u2032n of\nN \u2208 Sn with N \u2229 G\u2032 = 1 and \u03c6(N) = N \u2032\u2032 . For any N \u2208 S\u2032n , by composing\nthe isomorphism \u03c6\u22121 : N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 N and the inclusion N \u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ), we have\n\u03c6\na section N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ) to \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ) \u2212\n\u2192 N \u2032\u2032 . This correspondence induces\nan injection S\u2032n \u2192 S\u2032\u2032n , where S\u2032\u2032n is the set of sections N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ) to\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ) \u2212\n\u2192 N \u2032\u2032 . Now we prove that the set S\u2032\u2032n is finite. Suppose that S\u2032\u2032n 6= \u2205.\nTake a section s0 : N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ) in S\u2032\u2032n . Then we know that any section\ns : N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ) in S\u2032\u2032n factors through the semi-direct product G\u2032 \u22ca s0 (N \u2032\u2032 )\nwhich is a subgroup of \u03c6\u22121 (N \u2032\u2032 ). Let K be the kernel of the conjugate action\nN \u2032\u2032 \u2192 s0 (N \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 Aut (G\u2032 ), which is an open normal subgroup of N \u2032\u2032 . Then\nthe restriction to K of any section s : N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 G\u2032 \u22ca s0 (N \u2032\u2032 ) in S\u2032\u2032n factors\n4\n\n\fthrough G\u2032 \u00d7 s0 (K). This is completely determined by s0 and the projection\nof s|K to G\u2032 . Since K is small, there are only finitely many possibilities of\nthe restriction of sections s : N \u2032\u2032 \u2192 G\u2032 \u22ca s0 (N \u2032\u2032 ) to K. Since K is open in\nN \u2032\u2032 , we conclude that S\u2032\u2032n is a finite set.\nLemma 2.7. Let G\u2032 \u2192 G \u2192 G\u2032\u2032 \u2192 1 be an exact sequence of profinite\ngroups. If G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 are small, then so is G.\nProof. For any positive integer n, let Sn be the set as in Lemma 2.6. For\neach N \u2208 Sn , we have G\u2032 \u2229 N \u2701 G\u2032 and (G\u2032 : G\u2032 \u2229 N) \u2264 n. Note that\nG\u2032 \u2229 N is also normal in G. By taking quotient groups, we have an exact\nsequence G\u2032 /G\u2032 \u2229 N \u2192 G/G\u2032 \u2229 N \u2192 G\u2032\u2032 \u2192 1. By the smallness of G\u2032 , there\nare only finitely many possibilities of open normal subgroups of G\u2032 with the\nform G\u2032 \u2229 N when N runs through all the open normal subgroups of G with\n(G : N) \u2264 n. Let N1\u2032 , . . . , Nr\u2032 be such open normal subgroups of G\u2032 . Clearly\nwe have\nSn =\n\nr\n[\n\n{N \u2701 G | (G : N) \u2264 n, Ni\u2032 \u2282 N}\n\n\u2243\n\ni=1\nr\n[\n\n\b\nN\u0304 \u2701 G/Ni\u2032 | (G/Ni\u2032 : N\u0304) \u2264 n .\n\ni=1\n\nHence it is sufficient to replace G by G/Ni\u2032 and assume G\u2032 is a finite subgroup\nof G. Let N0 be an open normal subgroup of G with G\u2032 \u2229 N0 = 1 (such N0\nexists since G is Hausdorff and G\u2032 is finite). When N runs through all the\nopen normal subgroups of G with (G : N) \u2264 n, there exist only finitely many\npossibilities of open normal subgroups of G with the form N \u2229 N0 by Lemma\n2.6. Since N \u2229 N0 is open in G, this implies that there are only finitely many\npossibilities of such N. Hence G is small.\nWe recall a homotopy exact sequence of \u00e9tale fundamental groups.\nProposition 2.8 ([12], Lem. 2). Let S be a connected normal and locally\nNoetherian scheme with generic point \u03b7. Let X be a scheme which is smooth\nand surjective over S and assume that its geometric generic fiber X\u03b7 is connected. Then the sequence of \u00e9tale fundamental groups\n\u03c01 (X\u03b7 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u03c01 (S) \u2192 1\nis exact.\nFinally, we prove the following theorem.\n5\n\n\fTheorem 2.9. Let X be a connected scheme of finite type and dominant\nover Z. Then the \u00e9tale fundamental group \u03c01 (X) is small.\nProof. We shall first reduce to the case in which X is a normal scheme smooth\nover OF of a number field F and the geometric generic fiber XF := X \u2297OF F\nis connected.\nSince the scheme X is Noetherian, we have finite number of irreducible\ncomponents X1 , . . . , Xn of X. The natural morphisms Xi \u2192 X induce a\nmorphism \u2294i Xi \u2192 X which is an effective descent morphism. By using the\ndescent theory ([8], Exp. IX, Th. 5.1), the group \u03c01 (X) is a quotient of the\ngroup generated by \u03c01 (Xi ) for all i and finitely many generators. Thus, we\nmay reduce to the case X is irreducible by Proposition 2.4 and Lemma 2.5.\nSince we have an isomorphism \u03c01 (X) \u2243 \u03c01 (Xred ) for the reduced closed\nsubscheme Xred of X (op. cit., Exp. IX, Prop. 1.7), we may assume that X\nis integral. Let X \u2032 \u2192 X be the normalization morphism of X. Since X is an\nexcellent scheme, it is a finite morphism ([7], 7.8.3 (iii), 7.8.6 (i), (ii) or [15],\n8.2.3). By the descent theory ([8], Exp. IX, Th. 5.1) again, we know that\nthe group \u03c01 (X) is a quotient of the group generated by \u03c01 (X \u2032 ) and finitely\nmany generators. By Proposition 2.4 and Lemma 2.5, we may assume that\nX is normal. Let F be the algebraic closure of Q in the function field of X.\nThen the geometric generic fiber XF is connected. Since X is dominant over\nOF , it is flat over OF ([15], Chap. 4, Prop. 3.9). For any open subscheme U\nof X, the induced homomorphism \u03c01 (U) \u2192 \u03c01 (X) is surjective. Therefore,\nshrinking X if necessary, we may assume that X is smooth over Spec(OF ).\nLet S be the image of X by the structure morphism X \u2192 Spec(OF ).\nSince X is flat over OF , the set S is open in Spec(OF ) ([7], 2.4.6). Note\nthat the complement of S is a finite set since OF is a Dedekind domain. By\nProposition 2.8, we have the following exact sequence:\n\u03c01 (XF ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X) \u2192 \u03c01 (S) \u2192 1.\nThe fundamental group \u03c01 (S) is small by the Hermite-Minkowski theorem\nand \u03c01 (XF ) is topologically finitely generated ([9], Exp. II, Th. 2.3.1). Hence\n\u03c01 (X) is small by Lemma 2.7.\nRemark 2.10. The same argument works for a connected scheme X of finite\ntype over a local field k with characteristic 0. Since the group \u03c01 (Spec(k)) is\nknown to be topologically finitely generated, so is \u03c01 (X).\n\n3\n\nFundamental groups with modulus\n\nThe notion of coverings with restricted ramification defined in [11] is not stable under base change even if our attention restricts to tame covers (cf. [18],\n6\n\n\fExam. 1.3). In this section, we shall introduce the notion of coverings of ramification bounded by a modulus which is a slight modification of G. Wiesend's\ntame coverings ([23]). Such coverings are stable under base change and form\na Galois category.\nFollowing [14], we denote by Sch(Z) the category of schemes separated\nand of finite type over Spec(Z). We call X \u2208 Sch(Z) flat if its structural\nmorphism X \u2192 Spec(Z) is flat, and vertical (or a variety) if the structural\nmorphism factors through Spec(Fp ) for some prime number p. Note that an\nintegral scheme X \u2208 Sch(Z) is either flat or vertical. A curve is an integral\nscheme in Sch(Z) of dimension 1. A curve on a scheme X in Sch(Z) is a\nclosed subscheme of X which is a curve. For any curve C on X, let k(C)\ne the normalization of C. If the curve C is\nbe the function field of C and C\nregular, there exists a unique regular curve P (C) \u2208 Sch(Z) which is proper\nover Z and contains C as a dense open subscheme (cf. [13], Prop. 1.6). We\ne with the normalized valuations in\nalways identify closed points x in P (C)\nk(C) associated with x. In particular, we write k(C)x the completion of k(C)\ne\nwith respect to the valuation corresponding to a closed point x \u2208 P (C).\nDefinition 3.1. For every curve C on a scheme X \u2208 Sch(Z), a modulus mC\non C is a finite set (mC,x )x\u2208P (C)r\ne C\ne of non-negative integers mC,x associated\ne r C.\ne A modulus m = (mC )C\u2282X on X is a\nwith closed points x in P (C)\ncollection of moduli mC associated with curves C on X.\n\nNote that the sets of points and of curves on a scheme X \u2208 Sch(Z) are\nat most countable, since a countable Noetherian ring has at most countably\nmany prime ideals (cf. [14], Sect. 7). By using the notion of modulus, we\nrestrict the ramification of coverings as follows:\nDefinition 3.2. (i) Let K be a complete discrete valuation field, GK the\nabsolute Galois group of K and L a separable extension field of K. For any\nrational number m > \u22121, we say that the ramification of L/K has bounded\nm\nby m if Gm\nK \u2282 GL , where GK is the m-th ramification subgroup of GK in the\nupper numbering ([20], Chap. IV, Sect. 3).\n(ii) For each regular curve C, let mC = (mC,x )x be a modulus on C. A finite\n\u00e9tale morphism C \u2032 \u2192 C is said to be of ramification bounded by mC if the\nextension of complete discrete valuation fields k(C \u2032 )x\u2032 /k(C)x has ramification\nbounded by mC,x for each x \u2208 P (C) r C and for each valuation x\u2032 of k(C \u2032 )\nover x.\n(iii) Let X \u2208 Sch(Z) be connected, and m a modulus on X. A finite \u00e9tale\nmorphism Y \u2192 X is said to be of ramification bounded by m if for every curve\ne \u00d7X Y , the ramification\nC on X and for each irreducible component C \u2032 of C\n\u2032\ne\nof the induced morphism C \u2192 C is bounded by mC .\n7\n\n\fLet X \u2208 Sch(Z) be connected. Choose a closed point x in X and take\na geometric point \u03be : Spec(\u03a9) \u2192 x, where \u03a9 is a separably closed extension of the residue field at x. We define a fiber functor Fx by Fx (Y ) =\nHomX (Spec(\u03a9), Y ) for any covering Y \u2192 X of ramification bounded by m.\nLemma 3.3. The category of coverings over X with ramification bounded by\na modulus m together with the fiber functor Fx is a Galois category.\nProof. We have to check the conditions (G1) - (G6) of [8], Expos\u00e9 V, Section\n4. Let Y1 , Y2 \u2192 X be coverings of ramification bounded by m, and C a curve\ne \u00d7X (Y1 \u00d7X Y2 ) \u2192 C\ne is of ramification bounded by mC\non X. The covering C\n([11], Lem. 2.2). Thus, the category of these coverings over X is closed under\nfiber products. Let Y1 \u2192 Y2 and Y2 \u2192 X be two finite \u00e9tale morphisms such\nthat the composite Y1 \u2192 X is a covering of ramification bounded by m. Then\nthe cover Y2 \u2192 X is of ramification bounded by m (op. cit., Lem. 2.2 and\nLem. 2.4). As in the proof of Theorem 2.4.2 in [10], the above arguments\nimply (G1) and (G2), namely, the existence of fiber products and quotients\nrespectively in the category. The assertions (G3) - (G6) can be deduced by\nthe straight forward manner.\nWe denote by \u03c01 (X, m) the fundamental group associated to the Galois\ncategory of coverings of X with ramification bounded by m. The notion of\nthe coverings above is stable under base change as follows: Let f : X \u2032 \u2192\nX be a morphism of connected schemes in Sch(Z) and m = (mC )C\u2282X a\nmodulus on X. For each curve C \u2032 on X \u2032 and closed point x\u2032 in P (f\nC \u2032) r f\nC \u2032,\nif f (C \u2032) is a closed point of X then put mC \u2032 := 0. On the other hand,\nif the topological closure f (C \u2032) = C of f (C \u2032 ) is a curve on X, then put\nmC \u2032 ,x\u2032 := ex\u2032 /x mC,x for f (x\u2032 ) = x , where ex\u2032 /x is the ramification index of the\nextension k(C \u2032 )x\u2032 /k(C)x . We put f \u2217 m := (mC \u2032 )C \u2032 \u2282X \u2032 , where mC \u2032 = (mC \u2032 ,x\u2032 ).\nLemma 3.4. Let f : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a morphism of connected schemes in\nSch(Z) and m a modulus on X. Then the morphism f induces a group\nhomomorphism \u03c01 (X \u2032 , f \u2217 m) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m).\nProof. Let Y \u2192 X be a covering of X of ramification bounded by m. It\nis enough to show that the induced covering Y \u00d7X X \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 of X \u2032 has the\nmodulus f \u2217 m = (mC \u2032 )C \u2032 \u2282X \u2032 for each curve C \u2032 on X \u2032 . If f (C \u2032) is a closed point\nof X, the covering Y \u00d7 C \u2032 \u2192 C \u2032 induces a separable base field extension and\nunramified. If the topological closure f (C \u2032 ) of f (C \u2032 ) is a curve C on X, it is\ne \u00d7X Y \u2192 C\ne whose ramification is bounded by mC . Thus,\na base change of C\n\u2032\nf\nthe induced covering C \u00d7X Y \u2192 f\nC \u2032 has ramification bounded by mC \u2032 .\n8\n\n\fFor two moduli m = (mC )C and m\u2032 = (m\u2032C )C on X, we write m\u2032 \u2265 m if\ne r C.\ne Thereby\nwe have m\u2032C,x \u2265 mC,x for each curve C on X and x \u2208 P (C)\n\u2032\nwe have a surjection \u03c01 (X, m ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m). Using this notation, we have the\nfollowing homotopy exact sequence.\nLemma 3.5. Let S \u2208 Sch(Z) be connected normal with generic point \u03b7, and\nf : X \u2192 S a smooth morphism in Sch(Z). Assume that the geometric generic\nfiber X\u03b7\u0304 of f is connected and the map f has a section s : S \u2192 X. Then, for\nany modulus m on X there is a modulus m\u2032 \u2265 m on X such that the sequence\nof fundamental groups\n\u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (S, s\u2217 m) \u2192 1\nis exact.\nProof. We basically follow the proof of Lemma 2 in [12]. For each curve D\non S, its image s(D) of the section s : S \u2192 X is a curve on X. Therefore\nwe have s\u2217 m = (ms(D) )D\u2282S . By Lemma 3.4, the section s : S \u2192 X induces\na homomorphism \u03c01 (S, s\u2217 m) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m). In general, we do not have a homomorphism \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 \u03c01 (S, s\u2217 m). By the very definition of the modulus\nf \u2217 s\u2217 m, we can take a modulus m\u2032 on X with m\u2032 \u2265 m, m\u2032 \u2265 f \u2217 s\u2217 m and satisfying m\u2032s(D) = ms(D) for each curve D on S. By Lemma 3.4 we obtain a\ncomposition of homomorphisms \u03b2 : \u03c01 (X, m\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, f \u2217 s\u2217 m) \u2192 \u03c01 (S, s\u2217 m).\nBy Proposition 2.8, we have the following commutative diagram\n\u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c01 (X)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03c01 (S)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 1\n\n\u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (X, m\u2032 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (S, s\u2217 m) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 1,\nwhose top row is exact. Therefore \u03b2 is surjective, and \u03b2 \u25e6\u03b1 = 0. To prove the\nexactness of the bottom row, we must show that for any connected covering\nX \u2032 \u2192 X with modulus m\u2032 which admits a section over X\u03b7\u0304 , there exists a\nconnected covering S \u2032 \u2192 S with modulus s\u2217 m such that X \u2032 = X \u00d7S S \u2032 . By\nthe exactness of the top row of the above diagram, we obtain a finite \u00e9tale\ncover S \u2032 \u2192 S with X \u2032 = X \u00d7S S \u2032 . For each curve D on S, the covering\nX \u2032 \u00d7X s(D) \u2192 s(D) is ramification bounded by m\u2032s(D) = ms(D) . Thus, the\ncovering S \u2032 \u2192 S has ramification bounded by the modulus s\u2217 m and the\nassertion follows.\nNow, we examine the smallness of fundamental groups with modulus.\nThe fundamental group \u03c01 (X, m) is a quotient of \u03c01 (X). Thereby it is small\nfor any flat and connected scheme X \u2208 Sch(Z) by Proposition 2.4, (ii) and\n9\n\n\fTheorem 2.9. When the scheme X is vertical, we need the assumption on X\nas in [14], Theorem 8.2.\nTheorem 3.6. Let X be a connected variety over a finite field k. Assume\nthat there exist an \u00e9tale morphism X \u2032 \u2192 X and a proper morphism X \u2032 \u2192 Z,\nwhere Z is a curve over k with generic point \u03b7. Then \u03c01 (X, m) and the\ngeometric part \u03c01 (X, m)geo := Ker(\u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 Gk ) of \u03c01 (X, m) are small for\nany modulus m on X.\nProof. For any \u00e9tale morphism f : X \u2032 \u2192 X, the induced map \u03c01 (X \u2032 ) \u2192\n\u03c01 (X) has finite cokernel and so is \u03c01 (X \u2032 , f \u2217 m) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m). Hence we may\nassume that we have a proper morphism g : X \u2192 Z over k. We may\nfurther assume that g : X \u2192 Z is surjective. By the descent theory for \u00e9tale\nfundamental groups, we may assume that the variety X is normal and the\ngeometric generic fiber X\u03b7\u0304 of g : X \u2192 Z is connected as in the proof of\nTheorem 2.9. Let U be the smooth locus of g : X \u2192 Z and i : U \u2192 X the\nopen immersion. Note that U is an open subscheme of X ([7], 17.15.12), and\nthe induced morphism g|U : U \u2192 Z is still surjective. By op. cit., 17.16.3, the\nrestriction g|U : U \u2192 Z admits a section over an \u00e9tale open Z \u2032 of Z. Hence\nwe may assume that the smooth surjective morphism g|U : U \u2192 Z has a\nsection s : Z \u2192 U. Now we replace the modulus m by m\u2032\u2032 so that it satisfies\n\u2032\u2032\nm\u2032\u2032 \u2265 m, m\u2032\u2032 \u2265 g \u2217 s\u2217 i\u2217 m and ms(Z)\n= (g \u2217 s\u2217 i\u2217 m)s(Z) = ms(Z) , where s(Z) is\nthe topological closure of s(Z) in X. Since the geometric generic fiber U\u03b7\u0304\nis irreducible, we have the following exact sequence by Lemma 3.5 for some\nmodulus m\u2032 \u2265 i\u2217 m on U:\n\u03c01 (U\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (U, m\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Z, s\u2217 i\u2217 m) \u2192 1.\nThe natural homomorphisms \u03c01 (U, m\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m) and \u03c01 (U\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 )\nare surjective. Hence the sequences\n\u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 \u03c01 (Z, s\u2217 i\u2217 m) \u2192 1\nand\n\u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)geo \u2192 \u03c01 (Z, s\u2217 i\u2217 m)geo \u2192 1\nare also exact. The fundamental group \u03c01 (Z, s\u2217 i\u2217 m)geo is small (cf. [6], Th. 8.23.5)\nand \u03c01 (X\u03b7\u0304 ) is topologically finitely generated ([8], Exp. X, Th. 2.9) since the\nfiber X\u03b7\u0304 is proper. Thus, the assertion follows from Lemma 2.7.\nRemark 3.7. It is known that the tame fundamental groups for curves over\na finite field are topologically finitely generated. By the same manner as in\nthe proof of the above theorem, for a variety X over a finite field which is\n\u00e9tale locally proper over a curve, we can prove that the tame fundamental\ngroup \u03c01tame (X) is also topologically finitely generated.\n10\n\n\f4\n\nApplication to representations of fundamental groups\n\nAs an application of the Hermite-Minkowski theorem and the finiteness of\nray class groups, the following finiteness of Galois representations over an\nalgebraically closed field k is obtained (for the geometric version of this result,\nsee [16], Th. 4 (i)). Here, we always consider the general linear group GLd (k)\nas a topological group with the discrete topology.\nTheorem 4.1 ([1], see also [16], Th. 1). Let k be an algebraically closed\nfield and F a number field. Suppose that the characteristic of k is 0. For\nany positive integer d, there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes of\ncontinuous semisimple representations \u03c1 : GF \u2192 GLd (k) with bounded Artin\nconductor.\nIn the case where the characteristic of k is p > 0, H. Moon and Y. Taguchi\nproved the finiteness of mod p Galois representations with solvable images\nover k both for the number field case and for the function field case ([16], Th.\n2, Th. 4 (ii)). For the function field case, the finiteness has been obtained in\nalmost all the cases by G. B\u00f6ckle and C. Khare (see [2]).\nBy using the fundamental groups with modulus defined in Section 3 instead of the Artin conductor, the finiteness of mod p Galois representations\nis equivalent to the finiteness of representations of the fundamental group\n\u03c01 (X, m), where X is a curve in Sch(Z) and m is a modulus on X.\nDefinition 4.2. For any topological group G and non-negative integer r,\ndefine the r-th commutator subgroup G(r) of G by the topological closure of\nthe commutator subgroup [G(r\u22121) , G(r\u22121) ] in G(r\u22121) for r \u2265 1, and G(0) := G.\nNow we prove the finiteness of \u03c01 (X, m)/\u03c01 (X, m)(r) by reducing to the\none-dimensional case. The following proposition is essential for the proof.\nProposition 4.3 ([14], Th. 2.9 (i)). Let X \u2208 Sch(Z) be connected normal.\n(i) If X is flat, then there exists a horizontal curve C on X such that the\ninduced homomorphism \u03c01 (C)ab \u2192 \u03c01 (X)ab has an open image.\n(ii) If X is vertical, assume that there exist an \u00e9tale open X \u2032 \u2192 X and a\nproper generically smooth morphism X \u2032 \u2192 Z to a regular curve Z. Then we\nfind a curve C on X with the same property as in (i).\nLemma 4.4. Let X \u2208 Sch(Z) be connected normal and m a modulus on X.\n(i) If X is flat, then \u03c01 (X, m)/\u03c01 (X, m)(r) is finite for any integer r \u2265 1.\n\n11\n\n\f(ii) If X is vertical over a finite field k we assume that there exist an \u00e9tale\nopen X \u2032 \u2192 X and a proper generically smooth morphism X \u2032 \u2192 Z to a\nregular curve Z over k. Then \u03c01 (X, m)geo /\u03c01 (X, m)geo,(r) is finite for any\ninteger r \u2265 1.\nProof. (i) In the case of r = 1, we write \u03c01 (X, m)/\u03c01 (X, m)(r) = \u03c01 (X, m)ab .\nBy Proposition 4.3 there exists a flat curve C on X such that the induced\nhomomorphism \u03c01 (C, mC )ab \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)ab has open image. Hence, we have\nthe following commutative diagram\n\u03c01 (C)ab\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c01 (X)ab\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u03c01 (C, mC )ab \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)ab .\nSince \u03c01 (C, mC )ab is finite and the homomorphism \u03c01 (C, mC )ab \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)ab\nhas finite cokernel, \u03c01 (X, m)ab is also a finite group.\nBy induction on r, we may assume that \u03c01 (X, m)/\u03c01 (X, m)(r\u22121) is finite.\nTake a Galois cover f : X \u2032 \u2192 X corresponding to \u03c01 (X, m)(1) . We have a\nsurjection \u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)(1) for the modulus m\u2032 := f \u2217 m on X \u2032 , and\nit induces a surjection\n\u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )/\u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )(r\u22121) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)(1) /\u03c01 (X, m)(r) .\nThus the assertion follows from the hypothesis and the finiteness of \u03c01 (X, m)ab =\n\u03c01 (X, m)/\u03c01 (X, m)(1) .\n(ii) In the case of r = 1, we have the desired result by the same manner as\nin (i). For r > 1, by replacing k with a finite extension field over k we may\nassume that the exact sequence\n1 \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)geo \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 Gk \u2192 1\nsplits. Since \u03c01 (X, m)geo,(r) is a characteristic subgroup of \u03c01 (X, m)geo , the\nsemidirect product \u03c01 (X, m)geo,(r) \u22ca Gk exists and it is a normal subgroup\nof \u03c01 (X, m). Let f : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a finite Galois cover corresponding to\nthe normal subgroup \u03c01 (X, m)geo,(1) \u22ca Gk . As in (i) this induces a surjective\nhomomorphism\n\u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )geo /\u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )geo,(r\u22121) \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)geo,(1) /\u03c01 (X, m)geo,(r) .\nHence we obtain the finiteness of \u03c01 (X, m)geo,(1) /\u03c01 (X, m)geo,(r) by induction\non r.\n12\n\n\fTheorem 4.5. Let k be an algebraically closed field with arbitrary characteristic, X \u2208 Sch(Z) connected normal, d a positive integer and m a modulus\non X.\n(i) If X is flat, then there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes of\nsemisimple continuous representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k) with solvable\nimages.\n(ii) If X is vertical over a finite field k we assume that there exist an \u00e9tale\nopen X \u2032 \u2192 X and a proper generically smooth morphism X \u2032 \u2192 Z to a regular\ncurve Z over k. Then there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes of\nsemisimple continuous geometric representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k)\nwith solvable images.\nProof. (i) For any group G, the solvability class of G is the minimal integer\ni \u2265 0 such that G(i) = 1. Note that every solvable subgroup G of GLd (k)\nhas solvability class \u2264 s, where s is a positive integer depending only on\nd ([21], Chap. V, Sect. 20, Th. 8). Thus every continuous representation\n\u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k) with solvable image factors through the quotient\ngroup of \u03c01 (X, m) by \u03c01 (X, m)(s) . Note that this quotient group is finite by\nLemma 4.4 (i). Thus the assertion (i) follows.\n(ii) By replacing the finite field k with a finite extension field, we may assume\nthat X has a k-rational point. Thus, the canonical exact sequence\n1 \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m)geo \u2192 \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 Gk \u2192 1\nsplits. Then we see that the restriction map from the set of isomorphism\nclasses of continuous semisimple geometric representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192\nGLd (k) into the set of isomorphism classes of continuous semisimple representations of \u03c01 (X, m)geo into GLd (k) is bijective. As we see in (i), every continuous semisimple representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m)geo \u2192 GLd (k) factors through\nthe quotient group \u03c01 (X, m)geo /\u03c01 (X, m)geo,(s) for some s, which is finite by\nLemma 4.4 (ii).\nTheorem 4.6. Let k be an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0,\nX \u2208 Sch(Z) connected normal, d a positive integer and m a modulus on X.\n(i) If X is flat, then there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes of\nsemisimple continuous representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k).\n(ii) If X is vertical over a finite field k we assume that there exist an \u00e9tale\nopen X \u2032 \u2192 X and a proper generically smooth morphism X \u2032 \u2192 Z to a regular\ncurve Z over k. Then there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes of\nsemisimple continuous geometric representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k).\n\n13\n\n\fProof. First note that, in the case of Theorem 4.6 (ii), by replacing the finite field k with a finite extension, the set of isomorphism classes of continuous semisimple geometric representations of \u03c01 (X, m) into GLd (k) is\nequal to the set of isomorphism classes of continuous semisimple representations of \u03c01 (X, m)geo into GLd (k). It is sufficient for the proof of (i) (resp.\n(ii)) to show that there are only finitely many possibilities of open normal subgroups of \u03c01 (X, m) (resp. \u03c01 (X, m)geo ) which appear as the kernels of semisimple continuous representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k) (resp.\n\u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m)geo \u2192 GLd (k)) since there exist only finitely many isomorphism\nclasses of irreducible representations of a finite group over k (cf. [3], (21.25)).\nLet \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m) \u2192 GLd (k) (resp. \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X, m)geo \u2192 GLd (k)) be a continuous semisimple representation. By Jordan's theorem (cf. [21], Chap.\nVI, Sect. 24, Th. 3) there exists an open normal subgroup N of \u03c01 (X, m)\n(resp. \u03c01 (X, m)geo ) containing the kernel Ker(\u03c1) of \u03c1 such that N/ Ker(\u03c1) is\nabelian and that (\u03c01 (X, m) : N) \u2264 J(d) (resp. (\u03c01 (X, m)geo : N) \u2264 J(d)),\nwhere J(d) is a positive integer depending only on d. Since \u03c01 (X, m) (resp.\n\u03c01 (X, m)geo ) is small, there exist only finitely many such N. Let f : X \u2032 \u2192 X\nbe the Galois covering corresponding to N. Then there exists a surjective\nhomomorphism \u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 ) \u2192 N (resp. \u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )geo \u2192 N) for the modulus m\u2032 := f \u2217 m on X \u2032 and it induces a surjection \u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )ab \u2192 N ab (resp.\n\u03c01 (X \u2032 , m\u2032 )ab,geo \u2192 N ab ). Thus N ab is finite by Lemma 4.4. Since N/ Ker(\u03c1) is\nabelian, the commutator subgroup of N is contained in Ker(\u03c1). This proves\nthe assertion.\n\nReferences\n[1] G. Anderson, D.
