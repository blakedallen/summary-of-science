A typical\nstructure is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The target is a composite shield\ncomprising a thin hard facing (F) and thick backing (B) of multilayered fabrics jointed\ninto a matrix. The facing plate is manufactured of hard materials. Among them we\nnote (i) steel, (ii) ceramics, and (iii) ceramic-metal composite, the so-called\nfunctionally graded material (FGM). High-strength and pliable fabric matrices\n(Kevlar, Dyneema, etc.) are used for the backing, fiberglass and other composites are\nused as well. Such shields are intended to protect light combat or cash-carrying\nvehicles, security doors, cabins and control rooms in boats and small ships, etc.\nagainst light arms [1].\nV0\n\nF\n\nB\n\nFig. 1 Impact of projectile onto composite shield\nIn the case of a local impact and penetration, the role of the facing is not only to\ndecrease the impact energy, but also (and it frequently turns out to be the main factor)\nto subsequently spread the impact over a wide area of the backing, energy being\ntransferred from the projectile to the protective structure. This spreading is realized\n\n1\n\n\fdue to the mushrooming of the projectile head and due to a plug of the fractured\nfacing pushed out by the projectile onto the backing.\nHard steel shields are conventional protective structures, while ceramics have\nbeen used in the recent decades. The ability of ceramics to be used as protective and\nstructural material against chemical, thermal and mechanical actions predetermined its\nwide promotion in hi-tech. Possessing a set of advantages (in comparison with\nmetals), ceramics show weak resistance to dynamic loading, especially to local impact\n[2-4]. In a ceramic plate, for example, a conoid plug is formed at the free rear, and a\nrelatively small amount of energy is absorbed in this process [5-6]. To suppress this\ndrawback a ceramic layer is confined by metal appliqu\u00e9s, which prevent drastically\ndeveloped fracture of free surfaces [7]. It is important to underline that under extreme\nconditions of high-speed penetration a brittle material can flow in an impact area as\nductile, and, vice versa, a ductile material can exhibit brittle features. Therefore the\nsame penetration models can be successfully used to describe high-speed penetration\nprocesses in metals and ceramics [8-11].\nThe work on ceramic-metal FGM for ballistic protection was initiated by the\npatent [12]. FGM aims at optimizing the performance of material components in\nterms of their spatial coordinates. Ceramic-metal composites are meant to combine\nsome of the desired properties of the ceramic component, such as hardness, with\nthose, like toughness, of the metal component. An example of the hardness profile is\nschematically shown in Fig. 2.\n\nhardness\n3\nhard material 2\n\nFGM\n\nsoft material\n\n1\nthickness\nFig. 2 Hardness profile of FGM shield\nThe property profiles across the FGM applique thickness should be established to\nmaximize the resistance to penetration and to increase the stopping power of the\ncomposite target vs. high-speed projectiles. The role of the material properties in\nresistance to penetration in a plate varies as the projectile goes deeper and approaches\nthe rear surface. In general outline, hardness is more important in the vicinity of the\nfront surface, while fracture toughness, plasticity of the material and ability to resist\nits elongation become critical with increasing depth. For example, ship armor is\nusually treated by carburizing its front surface to be harder, and by specific heat\ntreatment to increase plasticity of its rear. Some advancements concerning protective\nFGM design in the world-leading body, U.S. Army Laboratory, were published in\n[13].\nThere are some significant results in the mathematical modeling of high-speed\npenetration processes. In parallel with purely empirical dependences which have\nusually found applications, there are two theoretical approaches, namely:\n(i) computer codes based on the general theory of continuous media and some\nempirical constants (see, for example, [10, 14-18]), and\n\n2\n\n\f(ii) semi-empirical and analytical models based on relatively simple schemes of the\nrelated processes and some experimental results at hand (see [8-11, 19 - 32]).\nThe most general first approach is realized in a variety of cumbersome computer\ncodes based on general laws of mechanics, constitutive equations and some empirical\nconstants. These codes enable a set of problems to be calculated in many important\ncases of impact and penetration of brittle-ductile composite structures. However, their\ndisadvantages follow from their generality the constitutive equations and fracture\ndynamics conditions have not yet been sufficiently investigated, some parameters can\nbe obtained only by complicated experiments, which, as a rule, are too expensive.\nThere are many works (see, e.g., [23-28]) related to the second approach and\ndevoted to dynamic testing and theoretical description of specific phenomena\nobserved in fabric armors at impact and penetration regimes. However, many aspects\nof these complicated processes have not been adequately studied and no finally\ncompleted theory has been developed to describe dynamic fracture in metal/ceramicfabric structures under impact. All this makes it difficult to use theoretical methods in\nthe topical problem of optimizing composite protection. It could be also seen that\nthere is no considerably developed theory of penetration into FGM.\nIn the present paper we develop and link models (empirical, analytical and\nnumerical) that describe several penetration stages in order to examine the stopping\npower of composite targets with three types of facing \u2013 thin hard steel, thick ceramics\nor FGM, and with multiply fabric backing. We use the likely assumption that the\nbacking does not influence the facing; the developed models are related to successive\nindependent stages: perforation of the primary armor and penetration into the\nsecondary one. Then we bring together the developed algorithms and elaborate a\ncommon computer tool. Calibration of the tool has been done on the basis of a\ncomparison of calculation and test results implemented by the Rocket Systems\nDivision (RSD) at the Israeli Military Industries Co.\nFirst, the designed formula for perforation of a thin backing is presented.\n1 DYNAMIC PUNCTURE OF A THIN METAL FACING\nMathematical modeling of such a process at high-speed impact results in empirical\nformulas (see, e.g., [22, 25, 29]) including parameters of credible rheology of the\nmaterial. In this paper a more simple formula based on energy consideration and on a\nsingle empirical is designed as a result of data processing. We use the tests conducted\nby the RSD that consisted of seven series of a number of shots in each by M-16 and\nAK-47 bullets onto steel plates of various thicknesses and hardnesses. The scheme of\ntests with M-16 shots is shown in Fig. 3 (a). For this bullet we have: m =3.6g, d = 5.62\nmm (caliber), L0 = 15mm (the length of an effective cylinder that is to be used below).\nImpact and residual velocities, V0 and Vr, are measured.\n\ngiven\n\na\nVr\n\nBH\n\n1\n\nV0\nd\n\nm\nL0\n\nb\n7 53 2\n6\n\nh\n\nVr\n\n0\n\nVr V0\n\n2\n\nc\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n4\n\n8\n\nh\n\nFig. 3 Scheme of the test a , and data processing : b\n3\n\n0\n\nVbl V0\n\nc.\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\fIn Table 1 results are presented of 7 series of shots by M-16 bullets.

There were 5 10 shots in each series with the impact velocity within\nthe range of V0 ~ 955 1025 m/s, while the ranges for plate parameters are BH ~ 480\n700 and h ~ 2.4 8.9 mm.

The latter then plays the role of the initial impact velocity\nfor the backing.\nIn the situation that key thermo-physical parameters of the explored fast dynamic\nprocess are unknown we tend to design data processing as simply as possible.\nLet us consider the ratio of bullet kinetic energy Ekin = mV02/2 and work of plastic\nq dq , where is a part of kinetic energy absorbed by plastic\nstrains W p\nY\nQ\n\nresistance, Y is the yield limit and q is the strain distribution within the deformed\ndomain Q.\nThen we reconstruct Wp using data at hand: Wp = f.HB.h.d2 where f is the fitting\nfactor. Our aim is to evaluate factor f. Equating Ekin and Wp we obtain\nVrc\n\n2\nV 02 Vbl2 , Vbl\n\nf BH h d 2 m ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere Vbl is the ballistic limit.\nFormula (1.1) provides the best approximation to data if factor f = 2.47.107: a\ngood coincidence can be seen between the results presented in the two last columns\nin Table 1 and Fig. 1 (c) (in the latter test data marked by circles). It was also\nobtained: f = 2.95.107 for an AK-47 bullet (its initial parameters are: m = 0.0097 kg, d\n= 0.0076 m). The residual diameter of bullets after perforation was evaluated as the\ndiameter of the outcome at the plate backing: dr = 1.27d (M-16) and dr = 1.33d (AK47). The data determined at this stage are used below as the input required for\ncalculation of penetration processes in the considered composite shields. As to the exit\nmass after perforation, mr, the tests discussed above result in a significant dispersion\n\n4\n\n\f(mr ~ 0.6\ndebris.\n2\n\n1.6). The reason is the difficulty in accounting for a huge amount of exited\n\nPLASTIC FLOW MODEL OF PENETRATION INTO A THICK FACING\n\nBelow we present calculations based on a jet plastic-flow model enabling all residual\nparameters of high-speed penetration to be obtained with the same accuracy.\nA hydrodynamic quasi-steady-state model of high-speed penetration by metal\nKEP into thick targets is developed, as a constrained flow of the projectile and target\nmaterials with regard to plastic flow resistance. The formulation is related to\npermanently improved jet models of high-speed penetration by a KEP, with a halfcentury history. In the conventional classification (see, e.g., [19, 22]) the process of\nhigh-speed penetration by a KEP into a thick target is subdivided into several stages.\nAmong them, the quasi-steady-state stage of the projectile motion within the target\ndominates. A major part of the kinetic energy of the projectile is consumed at this\nstage, which determines the main penetration parameters: penetration depth, projectile\nerosion and crater size.\nThis first (and simplest) hydrodynamic model [30] a collision of two jets of\nideal fluids is asymptotically exact because hydrodynamic factors become dominant\nwith increase in the penetration velocity, V. In this sense, the ratio V2/ Y is decisive\n( and Y are the density and yielding limit of the target material). However, for\nregular ballistic velocities, one to two thousand meters per second, it is not high\nenough to permit neglecting the strength factor. The resistance of materials to\npenetration was introduced into the jet model by Alekseevski [31] and Tate [32]: two\nstrength factors, p and t, related to resistance of projectile and target materials P\nwere added into the \"modified\" Bernoulli equation for jet collision. This version is\nstill in use (see [33-34]) for estimation of crater depth in targets of plastic and brittle\nmaterials and for evaluation in tests of the above-mentioned strength factors. At the\nsame time, its essential drawback is that the model provides no way to determine the\ncrater geometry and the projectile shape. The latter is of essential practical importance\nmost notably for composite armor. In [8] and [11] the jet model was successively\nimproved. Firstly, in [8], the movement is taken into account of backward jets in the\ndirection opposite to penetration (see Fig. 3) realized under the condition of detached\nflows. Such an improvement enables the mentioned parameters to be evaluated.\nSecondly, two new strength factors, p+ and t+, are introduced into the modified\nBernoulli equations for backward jets. Whereas p and t are confirmed to satisfy the\nexperimental data concerning the crater depth, the newly introduced parameters are\ntheoretically defined from the expression for the plastic work. The latter is obtained in\n[11] based on the scheme of proportional strain of backward jet materials, which\nallows this work to be defined in terms of the initial and final parameters of the flow.\nLastly, a thermo-viscoplastic penetration problem was considered in [35], in which\nthe shear localization phenomenon and melt wave motion were described. The\nresistance to shear in the molten layer decays almost to zero, it results in separation of\nthe projectile-target materials motion with negligible shear stresses in the interface\nand validates the modified Bernoulli equation for plastic jets.\nIn this paper, the model [11] is adapted to the thick facing of the FGM. First of all\nwe explain the geometrical scheme of the model presented in Fig.3. Section A A is\nthe free surface, O is the stagnation point (the point of jets collision), section B B is\nthe current stationary penetration state, in which penetration zone I (area of target and\n5\n\n\fprojectile interaction) bounded by radius r = R, R R1 and R1 R0 are thicknesses of\ntarget and projectile backward jets respectively; in zone II (r > R) the target is\nimmobile; V is the current velocity of the uneroded part of the projectile, Vt is the\npenetration velocity, Vt+ Vp+ are velocities of backward jets. Sub-indices \"+\" and \" \"\nare taken for jets flowing in the penetration direction and in the opposite to it,\nexcluding Vt\nwhich is directed to the free surface. It is related to the conventional\ndescription of the jet model, in which the axial coordinate moving with the stagnation\npoint is used the target jet runs against the projectile one.\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nII\n\nII\n\nI\n\nI\n\nV\n\nO\n\nVp\n\nVt\n\n2r0 2R0 2R1\n\n2R\n\nVt\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nFig.4 Scheme of the flow of detached jets\n\nThen we present the mathematical description of the problem related to the abovementioned scheme. First, the steady-state process is considered. In this way, all the\nmain parameters of the geometry are obtained: the boundary between immobile and\nfluid target material, R, the radius of the projectile mushroom cup, R1, the crater\nradius, R0, as well as the erosion rate of the projectile. Then, the deceleration of the\nprojectile, penetration depth, P, and crater volume, Qc, as functions of time are\ndetermined based on the step-by-step numerical algorithm.\nFirst, the steady-state coordinate system relation is\n\nVp\n\nV (t ) Vt ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere V p is the projectile erosion velocity, V (t ) is the current projectile velocity,\nand Vt is the penetration velocity. Then, the Bernoulli equation for the pressure at\nthe stagnation point O is\nt\n\nVt 2\n\n2\n\nt\n\np\n\nV p2\n\n2\n\np\n\n,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere t and p are experimental constants for the target and projectile. Note that\nequations (2.1) and (2.2) are present in the Alekseevski-Tate model which is true\nthanks to the common stagnation point. As confirmed by a set of tests (see, e.g.,\n[22]) t ~ 3 6 Yt , p ~ 1.5 3 Yp , where Yt and Yp are static yielding limits\nof target and projectile materials, respectively.\n\n6\n\n\fLet in the case of the FGM facing, the dynamic strength factor of target depends on\nthe penetration depth P: t = t (P), while t = const remains for a homogeneous target\nmaterial.\nIn addition to the usual formulation, we introduce the Bernoulli equation for each\nbackward jet too. In doing so, we modify the equation to take into account the specific\nwork of plastic strain, t*(P) and p*~ const, for each jet during the flow. That is, two\nadditional equations are introduced:\nt\n\nVt 2\n\nV\n\np\n\n2\n\n2\np\n\n2\n\nt\n\nP\np\n\nt\n\nV\n\np\n\nVt 2\n2\np\n\n2\n\n2\n\np\n\n(2.3)\n\nP ,\n\nt\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhich serve below to obtain the geometrical parameters of the target and projectile\nflows. The additional strength factors, t+(P) and p+ are to be obtained by the\nanalysis of the plastic resistance in backward jets.\nFor estimation of these specific works, we now base our considerations on the\nscheme of the proportional strain of the materials, the Mises plasticity condition and\nthe associated law of the plastic strain. Possible hardening and influence of\ntemperature on the \"global\" flow of the jets are neglected. In the considered case, as a\nresult of the deformation, a cavity of radius R0 arises in the target, and the projectile\nhead transforms to the back jet, whose internal radius is the cavity of radius R0. The\nfinal strain is defined by these values and the axial elongations which are assumed to\nbe independent of the radial coordinate. These conditions lead to the following\nexpressions for the specific works of plastic strain averaged over the radial coordinate:\n\nt\n\nt\n\n,\n\np\n\nR2\n,\n2\nR\nz 1\n\n:\n\n1\n\nt, p\nY\n\n3\n\nln 2 1 1 x\n\nz\n\ndx\n\n0\n\nR2\nz\n\n3 ln 2\n\nR2\n\nR12\n\n;\n\nR2\n,\n2\nR\nz 1\n\n:\n\np\n\n(2.5)\n\nr02\nz\n\nR12\n\nR02\n\nt\nwhere Yt\nY P .\nThe additional (to those of energy) equations of the model are the momentum\nequation:\n\nR2\n\nt\n\nt\n\nVt 2\n\n(R2\n\nR12 ) t Vt 2\n\nr02 (\n\np\n\np\n\nVp2 ) ( R12\n\nR02 )\n\np\n\nVp2\n\n(2.6)\n\nand the incompressibility equations:\nR 2 Vt\n\nR2\n\nR12 Vt ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nr02 Vp\n\nR12\n\nR02 Vp .\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe system (2.1) (2.8) serve for the determination of the seven unknowns\nVt ,Vt ,V p , V p , R, R1 , R0 , where R0(t) and R1(t) are the crater and projectile\nmushroom cup radii, respectively.\nNote that in the momentum equation (2.6) shear stresses are neglected on the\nboundary of the flow, r = R, and on the interface between the projectile and target\n\n7\n\n\fmaterials (the surface containing point O). It is based on results in the study of the\nlocalization phenomenon [35].\nIf the steady-state solution is obtained, then the transient problem is to be solved.\nThe current (residual) length Lr(t), uneroded mass m(t) of the projectile and its\nvelocity are\nt\n\nLr (t )\n\nL0\n\nV p dt , m (t )\n\nr02\n\np\n\nL r (t ) ; V (t )\n\np\n\nm(t ) , V 0\n\nV0 ,\n\n(2.9)\n\n0\n\nwhere L0 and V0 are initial parameters. The current crater depth, P(t), and the current\ncrater volume Q(t) (as the volume of the cavity of radius R0) are\nt\n\nt\n\nR02 (t )\n\nVt dt , Q t\n\nP( t )\n\n0\n\n0\n\ndP (t )\ndt\ndt\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe system (2.1) (2.11) completely determines the considered problem. These\nformulas are enough to calculate the penetration velocity and the crater depth, while\nt+(P) and\np+ (2.5), serving for the crater diameter and volume determination, are a\npriori unknown and are obtained within the calculation process on the basis of the\niteration method.\nA calculation algorithm and a computer program have been built on the basis of\na step-by-step finite difference algorithm. The time step t is chosen from the\nrequired accuracy condition. At the current time t we have all the needed parameters\ncalculated before and set\nt\np\n(i) The \"initial\" data for the iteration process is t P\np\nY .\nY P ,\n(ii) From (2.1) and (2.2) we obtain\nVt\n\nV (t ) 1\n\nVt\n\n0.5V (t ) 1\np\n\nt\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n, Vp\n\n,\n\n1\n\n,\n\n, Vp\n\nV (t ) 1\n\n1.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5V (t ) 1\n2(\n\n(2.11)\n\n1;\n\nt\n\np\n\n)\n\np\n\n.\n\n(iii) Using (2.3) and (2.4) we find the speeds of backward jets:\nVt\n\nVt 2\n\n2(\n\nt\n\nt\n\n)\n\nt\n\n, Vp\n\nV p2\n\n2(\n\np\n\n(iv) All radii are obtain from (2.6) (2.8), while (2.5) yields new\n\n)\n\np\n\nt\n\npt\n\nP and\n\n.\np\n\n.\n\nAt the following iteration calculations repeat taking into account these new values.\nThe iteration process is stopped if the required convergence is reached, i. e. a\npreassigned error is proved in obtaining t P and p in the process of the coupled\ncalculation of the geometry and the plastic resistance. After that the calculation of\n(2.9) and (2.10) results in the new penetration parameters and transition occurs to the\nnext time layer, t t. Calculations are stopped if one of conditions below is satisfied:\n\n1, V\n\n0, Vt-\n\n0 , V p-\n\n0 , Lr\n\n8\n\n0, Im Vt- , V p- , Vt , V p\n\n0\n\n\fThe described algorithm was realized in a computer program which works, as\ncalculations show, very fast. Below we describe some calculations conducted for\n\"experimental\" projectile-target pairs, for which a huge amount of test data is\npresented in [36, 37]. These pairs consist of three types of plates manufactured of\narmor steel HzB20 (below: t1), Steel 52 (t2) and Steel 37 (t3) and of two types of\ncylindrical projectiles manufactured of steel C110W2 (below, p1) and high-density\nmetal Densimet D17 (p2). In Table 1 the data related to material properties is\npresented, while in Table 3 the ratios range of calculated values of final crater depth,\nP, of final crater radius, R, and of final crater volume, Q, to experimental those are\npresented for some p/t pairs and in the impact velocities range of 1000 3000m/s.\nGood quantitative coincidence of results can be seen. In Fig.5 and 6 normalized\npenetration parameters vs. time are depicted: P P L0 , Lr Lr L0 , V\nV V0 ,\nQ\n\nQ q , where q is the initial volume of the projectile. The shown data and similar\n\nresults obtained for other pairs enable comparison between the simple jet model and\nthe one developed here: at relatively small velocities V0 the projectile erosion speed\nsignificantly exceeds the penetration speed (~ twice at V0 = 1000 m/s). If V0 increases\nthese speeds are drawn together approaching the hydrodynamic limit equal to 1 2 V0 .\nTable 2.

The fabric consists of thin\nplies, firm in tension, connected by well-deformed adhesive, whose main role is to\ndistribute stresses over plies. We consider the main assumptions of the designed\nmodel:\nthe plies themselves are deformed as thin membranes; the bending stresses in plies\nare too small with respect to tension stresses and are not taken into account;\nthe adhesive is an inertionless solid in tension-compression and shear\nmodes,\na ply fails if the tensile strain achieves a given limiting value;\nnormal/shear flaking in the adhesive occurs if stresses reach the given limiting\nvalues;\nAll the used stress-strain diagrams\n= ( ) in a ply and in the adhesive are\narbitrary. The above-listed assumptions enable the related mathematical model to be\nbuilt. In contrast to conventional models, in which backing is a single plate with socalled \"effective\" geometrical and physical parameters, we build a governing system\nof equations on the basis of \"discrete\" formulation: ply motion and its interaction with\nthe neighbors are described for each ply. Here we omit all technical details of the\ndiscretization procedure including the manner of mesh reconstruction along with\nprogressive projectile motion, peculiarities of penetration/perforation mechanics (plies\nfracture and delamination cracks, plug formation, perforation event, etc.). Some points\n\n10\n\n\frelated to the mathematical model and the computer tool can be found in [15, 28, 3840].\nThe designed calculation tool consists of two main blocks (below \u2013 I and II):\nI Perforation of the facing.\nI.1 Thin metal facing: Vr and dr are established with the use of experimental data at\nhand and fitting formula (1.1).\nI.2 Thick metal, ceramic or FGM facing: a subroutine with algorithm (2.11) runs\noutputting Vr, dr and mr.\nII Penetration of composite shields: The input data induced consisting of material\nconstants, projectile-impact data obtained in block I, and initial 3D mesh steps.\nThe main subroutine runs for calculation of system (3.1) \u2013 (3.3). Within each\ntime-step the mesh is rebuilt depending on the current fracture and delamination\ndynamics. The calculations are stopped if the projectile residual velocity is equal\nto zero, or the complete perforation occurs of the given target.\nThe tool, as was examined, has fast CP-time. Calibration of the tool has been\ncompleted by comparing the calculation results with the tests conducted by the RSD.\nIn this way, some effective parameters were evaluated that are presented in the model,\nbut not sufficiently confirmed by purposeful tests (generally speaking, the firmly\nstable data exist only for static loading).\n4 CALCULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nThe results of some simulations of composite shield penetration are presented\nbelow. First, metal-fabric composites are under our examination: subroutines I.1+II\nrun in the tool. Linear\nrelations were used for backing, Young moduli Et\n(tangential in-ply), Es and Ez (tangential and normal directions in the adhesive) and\ncorresponding limiting stresses: t,lim, s,lim and z,lim, are inputed.\nA set of displacement configurations (\"photos\") of a shield vs. time is depicted in\nFig. 7. Here and below the ply position corresponds to boundaries between light and\ndark strips. The input parameters are: projectile \u2013 AK-47 bullet, V0 = 740 m/s; facing\n\u2013 steel, h =0.004m, BH =500 (projectile residual parameters after facing perforation\nare: Vr = 567 m/s mr = 0.003 kg, dr = 0.0072 m); backing \u2013 Kevlar-29: mc = 19.4\nkg/m2, Et = 70 GPa, t,lim= 1.4 GPa, Es = 0.5 GPa, s,lim = 25 MPa, Ez = 2.0 GPa, z,lim =\n0.1 GPa. The number of plies in the package is: Np = 40. The output penetration\nparameters: time, t, depth, P, and projectile velocity, V, are presented below each\n\"photo\".\n\nt = 10 s\nP = 6 mm\nVr =513m/s\n\nt = 25 s\nP = 12 mm\nVr =391m/s\n\nt = 45 s\nP = 18 mm\nVr =277m/s\n\nt = 74 s\nP = 24 mm\nVr =169m/s\n\nFig. 7 Configurations of composite target vs. time\n\n11\n\nt = 118 s\nP = 26 mm\nVr =89m/s\n\ntstop= 137 s\nP = 28 mm\nVr =0 m/s\n\n\fIt can be seen that delaminations (beginning at time between t = 25 s and 45 s)\nseparate the backing into three parts: the upper package (plies n ~ 1,...,21) punctured\nrelatively fast with small strains occurring in the vicinity of the penetration area; the\nsecond essentially delaminated part (n ~ 22,...,32) characterized by propagation of\ndisc cracks in the adhesive with time and resulting in significant spreading of strain\nenergy into the periphery of a very pliable intact third part (n ~ 33,...,40), which\nstopped the bullet at the final penetration stage.\nWith the optimization problem in mind, some related calculations have been\nperformed. First, shields of the steel facing were examined. In Fig. 8 two \"photos\" of\npenetrated shields are shown. The previous facing and backings are examined\n(excluding Et for backings, which varied as shown in the table inside the figure). The\nimpact parameters are: M-16 bullet, V0 = 1000m/s (Vr = 567 m/s mr = 0.011 kg, dr =\n0.0095 m).\nn\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nEt\n\nP\n\nGPa mm\n50 18.4\n70 21.9\n100 17.7\n140 17.4\n\nNp*\n\nWc\n\n20\n26\n40\n40\n\n%\n100.0\n100.0\n95.0\n93.5\n\nn~4\n\nn ~1\n\nVr\n\nm/s\n0\n0\n167\n193\n\nFig. 8 Comparison of penetration in shields of different Young moduli of plies\nThe four last columns of the table consist of: the final penetration depth P (in the\ncase of perforation, P is fixed at time, tperf, when all plies are fully broken out and the\ndrag force is equal to zero), volume of perforated plies, Np*, amount of energy\nconsumed at the penetration event, Wc, and residual velocity, Vr (nonzero at the\nperforation event). The photos on the right related to the first and the last rows in the\ntable show the projectile stopped (n ~ 1, tstop= 116 s) and the shield perforated (n ~\n4, tperf = 69 s). These results confirm the known fact: more rigid armors can possess\nless stopping power. Note that the related concept of the so-called super-plastic\nprotective structures (SPPS) can be found in [40].\n\n2.5 GPa\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n750\n\n500\n\nM - 16\n\n500\nvV\nres\nr\n250\n\nAK - 47\n\nvV\nres\nr\n250\n\n(b) (a)\n\nN*p\n\n0\n\n50\n\n(b)\n\n0\n(a)\n\n(a)\n25\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\n(%)\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n40 60 N p 80 100\n\n(a)\n50\nN*p\n25\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60 N p 80 100\n\nFig. 9 Stopping power of Kevlar-29 and Kevlar-49 backings\nIn Fig. 9 the stopping power is compared of shields with \"rigid\" Kevlar-49\n(a) and \"pliable\" Kevlar-29 (b) backings vs. M-16 and AK-47 bullets. Stress-strain\ndiagrams of these materials are shown on the left. It can be seen that the stopping\n\n12\n\n\fpower of the pliable fabrics proves to be better than that of the rigid ones (a).\nSimulations of penetration processes were conducted with backings of varied ply\nnumber: Np = 0,...,100, residual velocities after facing perforation correspond to those\nshown at Np = 0. It can be seen that 40 plies of Kevlar-49 are enough to stop both\ntypes of bullets, while 45 plies (M-16) and 48 plies (AK-47) of Kevlar-49 are required\nfor this. On the right vertical axis, N*p , the volume of penetrated plies (\"trauma\") is\npointed in the case when the bullet is stopped by the target. As can be seen, an AK-47\nbullet makes the deeper trauma. Circles seen in the figure for an M-16 bullet\ncorrespond to test data obtained by RSD for Kevlar-29 backing manufactured of 10,\n20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 plies. Comparison of tests and calculations shows the good\nprediction ability of the tool.\nIn the last example, ceramic and FGM facings are examined (subroutines I.2+II run\nin the tool) in the case of penetration into semi-infinite targets. The strength\nparameters of the ceramic facing needed in the jet model are constants: Y t = 500\nMPa, t = 1.5 GPa, while those of the FGM linearly decrease till 250 MPa and 750\nMPa, respectively, over the length equal to10mm. After that they remain constants.\nThe density is constant: t = 3000 kg/m3. An AK-47 bullet plays the role of the\nprojectile. The aim of simulations was to obtain output data needed to run the\nsubroutine for calculation of the backing penetration process. In Fig. 10 (a) related to\nperforation of the facing, asterisks are the values of output parameters at time t = t10\n(when the penetration depth, P = 10 mm, is achieved in the ceramic facing), while\ndark circles are similar indicators in the FGM case. The time of the penetration stop is\nmarked by tstop. The output velocity in the ceramic case is greater (by ~ 17%) than in\nthe FGM case. At the same time the output diameter is greater (by ~ 15%) in the latter\ncase (the residual masses turn out to be practically the same). In Fig. 10 (b) these\nparameters are used as input ones in calculations of penetration into the Kevlar-29\nbacking with Np = 30. It is obtained in both cases: N*p = 15, although the penetration\ndepth turns out slightly greater in the case of the ceramic facing.\n\n.\n.\n\n2\n\nR1\n\n1\n\nt 10\n*\n\n00\n\n20\n\n1.5\n\n(a)\n\nV\n\n*\n\n1.0\n\n*\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\nP\n\nV\n\nt10 tstop\n40\n\nt\n\n*\n\n*\n\nt( s)\n\nstop\n\n60\n\n0.0\n0\n\nNp\n20\n\n40\n\nt( s)\n\n60\n\nFig. 10 Penetration into composite shields: solid curves \u2013 ceramic facing, dashed\ncurves \u2013 FGM facing.
