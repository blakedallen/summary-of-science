The problem of two fixed centers is a classical integrable problem,\nstated and integrated by Euler in 1760. The integrability is due to the unexpected first integral G. Some straightforward generalizations of the problem still\nhave the generalization of G as a first integral, but do not possess the energy\nintegral. We present some numerical integrations suggesting that in the domain\nof bounded orbits the behavior of these a priori non hamiltonian systems is very\nsimilar to the behavior of usual quasi-integrable systems.\nThe equations. Euler's problem in the plane (see Figure 1) is defined by the\nsystem of differential equations\n\u1e8d = \u2212a(xA , y)xA \u2212 b(xB , y)xB ,\n\n\u00ff = \u2212a(xA , y)y \u2212 b(xB , y)y.\n\n(1)\n\nThe two fixed centers are the points (1, 0) and (\u22121, 0), and the moving particle\nis the point (x, y). We have set xA = x \u2212 1, xB = x + 1,\na(\u03be, \u03b7) = mA (\u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 )\u22123/2 ,\n\nb(\u03be, \u03b7) = mB (\u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 )\u22123/2 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe problem can be defined in the 3-dimensional space in the same way, and is\nalso integrable, as was noticed by Euler. However, we will restrict ourselves to\nthe planar case.\nThe first step in Euler's integration was to exhibit two independent first\nintegrals of the motion. One is the energy\nH = (\u1e8b2 + \u1e8f 2 )/2 \u2212 \u00e3(xA , y) \u2212 b\u0303(xB , y),\nwith \u00e3(\u03be, \u03b7) = mA (\u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 )\u22121/2 , b\u0303(\u03be, \u03b7) = mB (\u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 )\u22121/2 . We will call the\nsecond one Euler's integral:\nG = CA CB \u2212 2\u00e3(xA , y)xA + 2b\u0303(xB , y)xB ,\n1\n\n\fwith CA = xA \u1e8f \u2212 y \u1e8b, CB = xB \u1e8f \u2212 y \u1e8b. Euler continued the integration, eliminating the second derivatives in (1) using the first integrals, and separating the\nvariables.\nOur generalization is simply to consider system (1) in the case where a\nand b are any homogeneous functions of degree \u22123. Indeed, we want to put a\nlittle restriction on these homogeneous functions. We will suppose that both\ndifferential forms \u03bea(\u03be, \u03b7)(\u03bed\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7d\u03be) and \u03b7a(\u03be, \u03b7)(\u03bed\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7d\u03be) are exact forms\non the plane minus the origin, and that the same is true when we change a\nin b. This hypothesis comes from the study of the problem of one fixed center\n(see [2] and [3]). It is not a strong restriction: the forms are already closed, so\nthe condition on each function is just the cancellation of two scalar quantities,\nnamely the integrals of both forms on a closed path around the origin.\nIt can be shown that any function a(\u03be, \u03b7) satisfying the above conditions\ncomes from a function A(\u03be, \u03b7) homogeneous of degree 1 as follows. Let us\ndenote by A\u03be , A\u03b7 the first derivatives of the function A and by A\u03be\u03be , A\u03be\u03b7 , A\u03b7\u03b7\nthe second derivatives. Then\na(\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03b7 \u22122 A\u03be\u03be = \u2212\u03be \u22121 \u03b7 \u22121 A\u03be\u03b7 = \u03be \u22122 A\u03b7\u03b7 .\nThe function a(\u03be, \u03b7) in Euler's case (2) is obtained in this way from the function\nA = mA (\u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 )1/2 . We also have A\u03be = \u03be\u00e3. It was discovered by the first\nauthor that G persists in the form\nG = CA CB \u2212 2A\u03be (xA , y) + 2B\u03be (xB , y),\nwhere B(\u03be, \u03b7) and B\u03be (\u03be, \u03b7) are associated to the function b in the same way as A\nand A\u03be are associated to a. In general, no integral takes the place of the energy\nintegral.\nQuasi-integrability. We report our numerical exploration of these generalized\nEuler's problems, showing three examples that seem to us significant. In all\ncases we met, the result is either escape or quasi-integrable behavior. The third\nexperiment displays some islands suggesting non integrability. Magnifying the\nneighborhood of a saddle point, a domain of irregular dynamics can be observed.\nThe obvious choice for a Poincar\u00e9 section is to fix the integral G and take,\nfor example, y = 0 (\u1e8f > 0). In each case, we show the iterates of some points\nof this Poincar\u00e9 mapping, the central orbit in the section and some typical\nquasiperiodic orbit. All the orbits in a given field of forces have the same value\nof Euler's integral. Since the examples have very large orbits, we have taken\nthroughout the numerical experiments a somewhat arbitrary cut-off criterion\ngiven by the value of any coordinate or velocity greater than a thousand.\np In all\nthe examples, we have taken A(\u03be, \u03b7) = (5\u03be 2 \u2212\u03be\u03b7+5\u03b7 2 )/10r, where r = \u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 ,\nwhich corresponds to a(\u03be, \u03b7) = (5\u03be 2 + 3\u03be\u03b7 + 5\u03b7 2 )/10r.\nFirst example. Figures 2 to 4 correspond to B(\u03be, \u03b7) = \u2212(\u03be 3 \u2212 3\u03be\u03b7 2 )/4r2 + r,\nand thus b(\u03be, \u03b7) = \u22122(3\u03be\u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03be 3 )/r6 + r\u22123 . The Poincar\u00e9 map is close to a linear\nmap, on a whole domain delimited by the escape criterion. This is quite strange.\n2\n\n\fAn explanation for this phenomena comes from geometrical considerations. We\nhave chosen the plane as the domain for the motion, but there is a natural\nbigger domain for this kind of systems. It is the manifold of half lines drawn\nfrom the origin in a 3\u2212dimensional vector space. Our plane is from this point\nof view just one half of the natural domain, a hemisphere chosen arbitrarily.\nEscaping orbits appear as orbits cut by the boundary of the hemisphere (in the\nclassical Kepler problem, hyperbolas appear in the same way as cut ellipses).\nThe theoretical grounds for this remark may be found in [4].\nSecond example. In Figures 5 to 7, we have chosen B = 4(\u03be 4 + \u03b7 4 )1/4 ,\nb = 12\u03be 2 \u03b7 2 (\u03be 4 + \u03b7 4 )\u22127/4 . Here the section displays a wide domain with strong\ntorsion but we are still very close from an integrable system. This rises the\nquestion: what are the integrable systems nearby? We know very few cases\nwhere our generalized Euler problem is integrable, namely the classical case\nand its projective transformations defined in [4] (which correspond for example\nto replace \u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 in Eq. (2) for b by any homogeneous quadratic expression in\n\u03be, \u03b7, and leave a as it is.) Because we needed to get sufficiently many bounded\norbits we were probably forced to stay close from integrable cases.\nThird example and final comments. In Figures 8 to 11, we have chosen\nB = (3\u03be 2 \u2212 \u03be\u03b7 + 3\u03b7 2 )/3r, b = (\u03be 2 + \u03be\u03b7 + \u03b7 2 )/r5 . Here the system behaves\nas a typical conservative system close to an integrable system. We are more\naccustomed to observe this in the class of hamiltonian systems, and one can\nargue that maybe the system is hamiltonian for some symplectic form. We do\nnot believe so, and rather relate this quasi-integrability to KAM theory applied\nto reversible systems (see [5], Theorem 2.9). Our systems are clearly reversible.\nAcknowledgments.
