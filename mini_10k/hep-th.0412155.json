This is certainly evident today in the exploration of\nAdS/CFT, where a weakly coupled gravity system in five dimensions is dual to fourdimensional super-Yang Mills theory at strong 't Hooft coupling. In general, very few direct\ncomparisons may be made between states at weak coupling and strong coupling. After all,\nfollowing a state from weak to strong coupling involves the observation of more and more\ncorrections, until finally the perturbative description, valid at weak coupling, breaks down\naltogether. In many cases, even the effective degrees of freedom are expected to change, so\nthat keeping track of individual states would not make sense.\nOn the other hand, the reason BPS states are useful is that, as shortened representations\nof the supersymmetry algebra, they are protected against corrections by supersymmetry.\nThus, in contrast with arbitrary states, they may be traced between strong and weak coupling. As such, they provide a primary means for extracting information out of systems\nwhich involve strong/weak coupling duality. For example, there is currently much interest\nin the 1/2 BPS excitations of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 configurations. From the bulk point of view, these\nstates have interpretation as either gravitational ripples or giant gravitons. These may be\ninvestigated either as classical solutions of the supergravity equations or through the worldvolume dynamics of wrapped branes. Furthermore, through duality, such states are also\nassociated with chiral primaries in the dual field theory. It is precisely the BPS nature of\nsuch excitations that allow such a rich connection to be made between seemingly different\nobjects such as branes, classical gravity backgrounds and chiral primary operators.\nIn a supergravity context, extremal black holes are an obvious choice as BPS objects to\nexplore. Such black holes have zero temperature and have a natural correspondence with\npure states in a quantum theory. In this case, like all states in a supersymmetric model,\nthe extremal black holes ought to form representations of the supersymmetry algebra. In\nparticular, the bosonic black hole solution itself must also be related to superpartner black\nholes carrying fermionic hair. In fact, such superpartners may be constructed by action of\na finite supersymmetry transformation \u03b4 on the original solution, represented schematically\n\n2\n\n\fas\n\u03a6 \u2212\u2192 e\u03b4 \u03a6 = \u03a6 + \u03b4\u03a6 + 12 \u03b4\u03b4\u03a6 + * * * .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, \u03a6 would be the metric, graviphoton or any other field in the supergravity theory.\nFor Poincar\u00e9 supergravity, a typical example would be the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom\nsolution with mass = charge. Clearly this coincides with the corresponding BPS condition\nM = |Z| where Z is a central charge in the supersymmetry algebra. In this case, exactly half\nof the supersymmetries \u03b4\u03a6 would vanish, namely those related to the Killing spinors of the\nbackground. On the other hand, the remaining fermion zero mode spinors would generate\nnon-trivial transformations, demonstrating that the black hole lies in a shortened multiplet\nof supersymmetry.\nThis construction of exact black hole superpartners was first carried out in [1] in the\ncontext of ungauged N = 2 supergravity in four dimensions. The method was also used\nin [2] to examine the dipole moments and gyromagnetic ratios of 1/2 and 1/4 BPS black\nholes in ungauged D = 4, N = 8 supergravity, in [3] to construct the fermionic partners\nof the supergravity description of D0-branes in ten dimensions, and in [4] to construct\nthe M2-brane multiplet in eleven dimensional supergravity. In general, for such extremal\nobjects in Poincar\u00e9 supergravity, it may be explicitly demonstrated that all superpartners\nhave identical masses and charges as the original black hole itself. At some level, this is\nsimply a kinematical consequence of satisfying the supersymmetry algebra. Nevertheless, it\nis reassuring to see that semi-classical methods may be successfully applied to the study of\nnew backgrounds with fermionic hair.\nIn this paper, we show that the same techniques for generating black hole superpartners\nin ungauged supergravities may also be applied to the case of gauged (or anti-de Sitter)\nsupergravities. However, it is important to note that the AdS superalgebra is different from\nthe Poincar\u00e9 one. In particular, masses (actually energies) and charges of the superpartners\nare no longer identical, but are related according to the AdS superalgebra. Below, we\nconstruct explicit superpartners for black holes in gauged D = 5, N = 2 supergravity and\ngo on to calculate the masses and charges of the superpartners. We verify that the mass\nand charge shifts indeed follow the pattern required by supersymmetry in AdS spaces.\nThe main purpose behind this construction of black hole superpartners is to demonstrate\nthat the fermion zero modes carry additional information about BPS background in supergravity. Although we work explicitly with black holes, the techniques we use are applicable\n3\n\n\fto any background with partially broken supersymmetry, even those without horizons. By\nfully studying the BPS states and their partners, we may also hope to obtain new methods\nfor exploring the lowest non-BPS excitations as well. While the zero-mode construction\nfails for non-BPS black holes (since the would-be zero modes are non-normalizable at the\nhorizon), this obstacle may potentially be overcome in geometries without horizons.\nIt is worth noting that obtaining a meaningful definition of mass and angular momentum\nin AdS spaces involves some care. While various definitions have been provided, we use\nthe holographic renormalization method [5, 6, 7], which is natural in an AdS/CFT context.\nProperties of the five-dimensional black holes which we are interested in have recently been\nexamined in [8, 9]. There it was demonstrated that a proper set of boundary counterterms\nwas necessary to ensure the validity of the BPS algebra on the boundary.\nWe begin in section II with a brief overview of N = 2 supergravity and very special\ngeometry as well as the familiar 1/2 BPS black hole solutions themselves. In section III\nwe identify convenient zero mode spinors and use these to modify the bosonic background\nof section II. In section IV we calculate the conserved charges of the new system, defining\nthe mass and angular momentum through the boundary stress tensor. We conclude in\nsection V by showing that these black holes fall into shortened chiral representations of\nAdS5 supersymmetry and find the gyromagnetic ratio of the spinning superpartners to be\ng = 1.\n\nII.\n\nBPS BLACK HOLES IN FIVE DIMENSIONS\n\nWe are interested in 1/2 BPS black hole solutions of gauged N = 2 supergravity in five\ndimensions coupled to n vector multiplets. The bosonic fields in this model consist of the\nmetric g\u03bc\u03bd , n + 1 vectors AI\u03bc , and n scalars \u03c6x , while the fermionic fields are the gravitino\n\u03c8\u03bc and n gauginos \u03bbx . The gauging of a U(1) subgroup of the SU(2) R-symmetry group is\nachieved by introducing a linear combination of the n + 1 vectors, A\u03bc = VI AI\u03bc where the VI\nare a set of constants. Since A\u03bc is what couples to R-charge, it will play a prominent r\u00f4le\nin the supersymmetry analysis of section V.\nThis theory was constructed in [10, 11], where particular attention was paid to the notion\nof very special geometry. We follow the conventions of [12, 13] and write the bosonic action\n\n4\n\n\fas\n1\n1\n1\ne\u22121 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03bb\nI\nI\nJ\ne\u22121 L = R \u2212 GIJ F\u03bc\u03bd\nF \u03bc\u03bd J \u2212 gxy (\u03c6)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6x \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6y \u2212 V (\u03c6) +\n\u01eb\nCIJK F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03c1\u03c3\nAK\n\u03bb , (2)\n2\n4\n2\n48\nwhere we use a signature (\u2212, +, +, +, +). The gauging of the U(1) subgroup introduces a\npotential V (\u03c6) which may be obtained from a superpotential W (\u03c6) through the relation\n1\n\u2202W \u2202W\n2\nV (\u03c6) = g xy x y \u2212 W 2 ,\n2\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6\n3\n\n(3)\n\nW (\u03c6) = 3gVI X I .\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\nFor very special geometry, the n-dimensional scalar manifold is obtained by introducing\nn + 1 scalar coordinates X I (\u03c6) along with the restriction V(X I ) = 1 where V is a homogeneous cubic polynomial\n1\nV = CIJK X I X J X K .\n6\n\n(5)\n\nIn this case, we have\nGIJ\n\n1\n=\u2212\n2\n\n!\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nln V\nI\n\u2202X \u2202X J\n\ngxy = GIJ \u2202x X I \u2202y X J ,\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nV=1\n\nwhere \u2202x \u2261 \u2202/\u2202\u03c6x .

Although\nonly P++ shows up explicitly in (11), we will make use of the other signs of P\u03b7\u03b7\u0303 in future\nsections.\n6\n\n\fThe Killing spinors corresponding to (11) were constructed in [12], and have the form\n1\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u01eb++ = eigt e\u2212U e\u2212 2 \u0393012 \u03b8 e 2 \u039323 \u03c6 e\u2212 2 \u0393014 \u03c8\n\n\u0012q\n\nf +1\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u0013\n\nf \u2212 1\u03931 (1 \u2212 i\u03930 ) \u01eb0 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 is an arbitrary constant spinor. By construction, \u01eb++ satisfies the projection\nP++ \u01eb++ = 0. Here we have used an explicit parameterization of the unit S 3 given by\nd\u03a923 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + cos2 \u03b8 d\u03c8 2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nand have used 2, 3, 4 to denote frame indices on S 3 , with\n\u00ea2 = d\u03b8,\n\n\u00ea3 = sin \u03b8 d\u03c6,\n\n\u00ea4 = cos \u03b8 d\u03c8.\n\n(16)\n\nIt is apparent from (14) that the Killing spinors split into two parts: one related to the t\u2013r\ndirections and the other corresponding to Killing spinors on S 3 . This feature may be made\nexplicit by choosing a Dirac decomposition\n\u03930 = i\u03c32 \u00d7 1,\n\n\u03931 = \u03c31 \u00d7 1,\n\n\u0393\u03b1 = \u03c33 \u00d7 \u03c3\u03b1\n\n(17)\n\nalong with the split \u01eb = \u03b5 \u00d7 \u03b7. Here it is important to realize that \u03b5 may be taken to be\nMajorana (real) in the 1 + 1 dimensional space spanned by t and r.\nWe now note that Killing spinors on S 3 corresponding to solutions of\n\u02c6 \u03b1 \u00b1 i \u03c3\u0302\u03b1 )\u03b7\u00b1 = 0\n(\u2207\n2\n\n(18)\n\nmay be written explicitly as\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03b7\u00b1 = e\u2213 2 \u03c31 \u03b8 e 2 \u03c33 (\u03c6\u2213\u03c8) .\n\n(19)\n\nIn this case, the projection (13) becomes\nP\u03b7\u03b7\u0303 = 21 [1 + f \u22121 (\u2212\u03b7\u03c32 + \u03b7\u0303gre3U \u03c31 )],\n\n(20)\n\nwhile the Killing spinors (14) have the form\nigt \u2212U\n\n\u01eb++ = e e\n\n\u0012q\n\nf +1\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u0013\n\nf \u2212 1\u03c31 (1 + \u03c32 )\u03b50 \u00d7 \u03b7+ .\n\n(21)\n\nWhen working with supersymmetry, we will make use of both representations (14) and (21)\ninterchangeably, whenever convenient.\n\n7\n\n\fIII.\n\nFERMION ZERO MODES AND BLACK HOLE SUPERPARTNERS\n\nBefore proceeding to analyze the fermion zero modes, we find it useful to familiarize\nourselves with the form of Killing spinors in AdS5 . Thus we first analyze the complete set\nof Killing spinors on the maximally supersymmetric AdS space, and then demonstrate that\nhalf of the original AdS Killing spinors naturally map into Killing spinors in the presence of\nthe black holes, while the other half become fermion zero modes.\nIn general, of course, any spinor that does not solve the Killing spinor equations \u03b4\u03c8\u03bc = 0,\n\u03b4\u03bbx = 0 may be considered to be zero modes. However, one has to be careful in identifying\nphysically distinct configurations, as opposed to pure supergauge degrees of freedom. The\nimportance here is the recognition of the global part of the supersymmetry algebra as the\nrepresentation generating part. In this sense, we demand that the fermion zero modes are\nexplicitly constructed to solve an alternate projection P\u2212+ , distinct from P++ of the Killing\nspinors. Note, however, that P\u2212+ is not the complement of P++ ; that is reserved for P\u2212\u2212\nsatisfying P++ + P\u2212\u2212 = 1. It instead defines orthogonality with respect to the Dirac inner\nproduct, P(\u2212\u03b7)(\u03b7\u0303) \u01eb1 P\u03b7\u03b7\u0303 \u01eb2 = 0. This is because \u01ed = \u01eb\u2020 \u03930 and so the \u03b7\u0303 term changes sign when\npermuted past \u03930 . Because of the background AdS curvature, this situation is somewhat\ndifferent from that used in [1], where in addition to satisfying a supergauge choice \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b4\u03c8\u03bc = 0\nthe fermion zero modes also satisfied the complementary projection P\u2212 instead of P+ .\n\nA.\n\nSupersymmetry in AdS5\n\nTo highlight the above issues, we now consider supersymmetry in the AdS5 vacuum. This\nis readily obtained by taking U = 0 and qI = 0 (so that XI = VI are constants) in the black\nhole ansatz of (9). In this case, the gaugino variation trivially vanishes, and (11) reduces to\nthe set\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b4\u03c8t = \u2202t \u2212 ( 23 \u2213 12 )ig + gf \u03930P\u00b1+ \u01eb,\ni\n\nh\n\n\u03b4\u03c8r = \u2202r + 12 gf \u22121\u03931 \u01eb,\n\n\u02c6 \u03b1 \u00b1 i \u039301 \u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u2212 f \u03931 \u0393\u0302\u03b1 P\u00b1+ \u01eb.\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03b1 = \u2207\n2\nh\n\ni\n\n(22)\n\nUnlike (11), here we have made use of the identity P++ = P\u2212+ + if \u22121 \u03930 to write the Killing\nspinor equations using both types of projections. One may solve these equations by starting\n8\n\n\fwith the solution \u01eb++ of the last section with U = 0. To generate the solution to the \u2212+\nequation, simply note that to change P++ into P\u2212+ one needs to permute through a \u03931 . This\nalso leaves the \u03c8r equation unchanged. This implies that a spinor of the form exp(igt)\u03931 \u01eb++\nsolves the \u2212+ equations. Pushing the \u03931 through until it is next to \u01eb0 , and then replacing\n\u03931 \u01eb0 \u2192 \u01eb0 (since \u03931 \u01eb0 is just as arbitrary as \u01eb0 ) gives the other solution. The AdS5 Killing\nspinors may then be written as.\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u01eb\u00b1+ = ei( 2 \u2213 2 )gt e\u2213 2 \u0393012 \u03b8 e 2 \u039323 \u03c6 e\u2213 2 \u0393014 \u03c8\n\n\u0012q\n\nf +1\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u0013\n\nf \u2212 1\u03931 (1 \u2213 i\u03930 ) \u01eb0 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 is again an arbitrary constant spinor. The sign of i\u03930 is directly connected to the\nprojection appearing next to \u01eb0 giving that we can replace the \u2213 sign in the exponential\nwith an +i\u03930 . This results in the usual form for the AdS5 Killing spinors except for the\nextra factor of exp( 23 igt). This extra factor is a direct result of the gauge choice for AI , but\nis otherwise physically insignificant.\nIt ought to be apparent that, taken together, the complete set of Killing spinors, \u01eb++ and\n\u01eb\u2212+ , guarantee the maximal supersymmetry of the AdS5 background. As seen from the \u03b4\u03c8\u03b1\nequation of (22), the AdS5 Killing spinors have a natural realization in terms of both types\nof Killing spinors on S 3 , namely \u03b7+ and \u03b7\u2212 of (19). using the standard Dirac decomposition\n(17), the above Killing spinors take on the form\n3\n\n1\n\n\u01eb\u00b1+ = ei( 2 \u2213 2 )gt\n\n\u0012q\n\nf +1\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u0013\n\nf \u2212 1\u03c31 (1 \u00b1 \u03c32 )\u03b50 \u00d7 \u03b7\u00b1 .\n\n(24)\n\nBy construction, the above spinors \u01eb\u00b1+ satisfy the projections\nP\u00b1+ \u01eb\u00b1+ = 0.\n\n(25)\n\nThe P++ case gives pure AdS5 spinors which, when multiplied by e\u2212U and with appropriate\nmodification to f (r), correspond to the preserved black hole supersymmetries identified in\nthe last section. We should also note that the pure AdS5 ++ spinors match the black hole\n++ spinors when r \u2192 \u221e (so that U \u2192 0) because the space becomes asymptotically AdS5 .\nThe \u2212+ solutions for pure AdS5 , on the other hand, are broken supersymmetries when\ngeneralized to the black hole solution; they correspond to fermion zero modes in this background. Although any spinor not satisfying the P++ projection would be sufficient to realize\nthe fermion zero mode algebra, the \u01eb\u2212+ are particularly convenient because they reduce to\nstandard Killing spinors in an asymptotically AdS5 spacetime and hence represent genuine\n9\n\n\ffermion zero modes related to the black hole geometry (as opposed to supergauge transformations of pure AdS5 ). For convenience, we will drop the label \u2212+ from zero mode spinors\nin future sections. Thus\n2igt \u03b1U\n\n\u01eb \u2261 \u01eb\u2212+ = e\n\ne\n\n= e2igt e\u03b1U\n\ne\n\ni\n\u0393 \u03b8\n2 012\n\n\u0012q\n\ne\n\n1\n\u0393 \u03c6\n2 23\n\nf +1\u2212\n\ne\n\ni\n\u0393 \u03c8\n2 014\n\n\u0012q\n\nf +1\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\nq\n\nq\n\n\u0013\n\nf \u2212 1\u03931 (1 + i\u03930 ) \u01eb0\n\nf \u2212 1\u03c31 (1 \u2212 \u03c32 ) \u03b50 \u00d7 \u03b7\u2212 .\n\n(26)\n\nHere \u03b1 is an arbitrary constant related to choice of supergauge condition; it will drop out\nin all physical quantities below. These properly identified fermion zero mode spinors will be\nthe starting point for the generation of the superpartners of the black hole solution of [12].\n\nB.\n\nZero Mode Identities\n\nThe black hole superpartners will be obtained via (1) up to second order in the supersymmetry transformation \u03b4. As a result, we are often faced with the task of simplifying bilinear\nexpressions in fermion zero mode spinors of the form (\u01ed\u0393*** \u01eb), where \u01eb is given by (26). Using the projection properties (25) for the zero mode spinors, as well as Dirac conjugation,\n\u01ed = \u01eb\u2020 \u03930 , one may obtain several useful identities:\n(\u01ed\u03931 \u01eb) = 0,\n(\u01ed\u03930 \u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u01eb) = 0,\n\n(\u01ed\u03930 \u01eb) = \u2212if (\u01ed\u01eb),\nf\n(\u01ed\u03931 \u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u01eb) =\n(\u01ed\u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u01eb),\ngre3U\n\n(\u01ed\u039301 \u01eb) = igre3U (\u01ed\u01eb),\ni\n(\u01ed\u039301 \u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u01eb) = \u2212\n(\u01ed\u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u01eb).\ngre3U\n\n(27)\n\nWe will make use of these identities below.\n\nC.\n\nBlack hole superpartners\n\nTo generate black hole superpartners, we will consider fermion zero mode transformations\nup to second order in \u01eb starting from the bosonic background (9) constructed in [12]. The\nfirst order variations using the zero modes will generate a fermionic (gravitino and gaugino)\nbackground. Rewriting (11) with the substitution P++ = P\u2212+ + if \u22121 \u03930 , and noting from\n(25) that P\u2212+ \u01eb = 0 for a fermion zero mode \u01eb, we obtain\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b4\u03c8t = \u2212U \u2032 2e\u22123U \u039301 + igr \u01eb,\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b4\u03c8r = U \u2032 \u03b1 + 1 \u2212 2if \u22121 \u03930 \u01eb,\n10\n\n\f\u03b4\u03c8\u03b1 = \u2212irU \u2032 \u039301 \u0393\u0302\u03b1 \u01eb,\n\u03b4\u03bbx = \u2212e\u2212U \u2202r \u03c6x \u039301 \u01eb.\n\n(28)\n\nNote that \u0393\u0302\u03b1 are Dirac matrices on the unit sphere, and are related to the full fivedimensional matrices by \u0393\u03b1 = reU \u0393\u0302\u03b1 .\nWe now turn to the terms second order in the supersymmetry variation, where the bosonic\nfields receive corrections. To obtain the second order variations \u03b4\u03b4(boson), we may simply\ntake their first variations in (8), and replace the fermions with their first variations given\nabove in (28). All other contributions would be set to zero when evaluated for a bosonic\nbackground.

For convenience, we take \u03b1 = \u22121 and furthermore define the spinor bilinear\n\u03bb \u2261 4(\u03b5\u03040\u03b50 ).\n\n(33)\n\nUsing the expression (1) for a finite supersymmetry transformation, we now observe that,\nup to second order in the supersymmetry variation (i.e. to lowest order in \u03bb), the bosonic\nfields may be expressed as\nds2(tot) = \u2212e\u22124U f 2 (1 + grU \u2032 \u03bbN)dt2 + e2U [f \u22122 (1 \u2212 2grU \u2032 \u03bbN)dr 2 + r 2 (1 + grU \u2032 \u03bbN)d\u03a923 ]\n\u22123rU \u2032 e\u22124U \u03bb dtK\u0302,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nAI(tot) = e\u22122U X I (1 \u2212 23 grU \u2032 \u03bbN)dt \u2212 21 r U \u2032 X I + \u2202r X I e\u22122U \u03bb K\u0302,\n(tot)\n\nXI\n\n= XI \u2212 12 gr\u2202r XI \u03bbN.\n\n(34)\n\nHere, K\u0302 = K\u0302\u03b1 d\u03b8\u03b1 is the 1-form associated with the Killing vector K\u0302 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b8\u2202\u03b1 . where the \u03b1 index\nis raised and lowered using the metric on the unit sphere, (15). In the following section,\nwe will examine the superpartner solutions (34), and in particular extract the superpartner\nshifts to the energy (mass), angular momentum and R-charge of the original black hole.\n\nIV.\n\nPROPERTIES OF THE BLACK HOLE SUPERPARTNERS\n\nHaving constructed a set of black hole superpartners, (34), in the N = 2 theory, we\nnow set out to explore their properties. We start by observing from (34) that angular\nmomentum (spin) is generated for the superpartners because of the off-diagonal metric\ncomponent proportional to dtK\u0302. This is of course expected, as from a semi-classical point\nof view we expect the superpartners of the spinless black hole to carry precisely spin-1/2.\nWe also see that the effective Newtonian potential in gtt is shifted by a multiplicative factor\n(1 + grU \u2032\u03bbN). It is this shift that indicates that the superpartner energies no longer coincide\nwith that of the original solution. This is a feature of supersymmetry in AdS spacetimes,\nand the energy shift clearly vanishes in the Minkowski limit g \u2192 0.\nA.\n\nEnergy and angular momentum\n\nIn order to make these observations on energy and angular momentum more precise, we\nmake use of holographic renormalization in AdS and in particular the boundary stress tensor\n12\n\n\fmethod for defining asymptotically conserved quantities [5, 6, 7]. Given a gravitational\naction I[g\u03bc\u03bd ], the boundary stress tensor is simply [14]\nT ab = \u221a\n\n2 \u03b4I\n1\n=\u2212\n(\u0398ab \u2212 \u0398hab ),\n8\u03c0G5\n\u2212h \u03b4hab\n\n(35)\n\nwhere hab is the boundary metric, h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc n\u03bd , with n\u03bc a unit normal to the boundary.\nIn addition, \u0398ab is the extrinsic curvature tensor, which may be expressed as\n1\n\u0398ab = \u2212 (\u2207a nb + \u2207b na \u2212 na nc \u2207c nb \u2212 nb nc \u2207c na ) .\n2\n\n(36)\n\nNote that the covariant derivatives are with respect to the 5-dimensional metric. We have\nalso used a, b, c, . . . to denote indices on the boundary. The expression (35), while divergent,\nmay be regulated via the addition of boundary counterterms. For this particular situation,\nthe appropriate counterterms were determined using the Hamilton-Jacobi method in [9].\nThe resulting renormalized stress tensor is given by\n8\u03c0G5 Tab\n\n!\n\n1\n= \u2212 (\u0398ab \u2212 \u0398hab ) + W (\u03c6)hab \u2212\n(2R(h)ab \u2212 R(h)hab ) .\n4g\n\n(37)\n\nHere W (\u03c6) is the superpotential given in (4) and Rab is the Ricci curvature on the boundary.\nWe note that although there are fermions present in the superpartner configuration, (34),\ntheir behavior in the stress tensor is dominated at large r by a factor of (U \u2032 )2 , and so the\nfermions fall off too fast at the boundary to contribute to (37).\nTo explore the boundary stress tensor, we take the black hole solution of (34) and expand\nnear the boundary at r \u2192 \u221e. Using r as the natural radial direction, the unit normal vector\n\nn\u03bc has as its only non-vanishing component nr = eU f \u22121 (1 \u2212 grU \u2032 \u03bbN), where we are only\nconcerned with the lowest order in \u03bb. Corresponding to this normal direction, the fourdimensional constant r surfaces are given by\nds24 \u2261 hab dxa dxb\n= \u2212e\u22124U f 2 (1 + grU \u2032 \u03bbN)dt2\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n+e2U r 2 (1 + grU \u2032 \u03bbN)\u011d\u03b1\u03b2 d\u03b8\u03b1 + 23 r \u22121 U \u2032 e\u22126U \u03bbK\u0302 \u03b1 dt\n\n\u0011\n\nd\u03b8\u03b2 + 23 r \u22121 U \u2032 e\u22126U \u03bbK\u0302 \u03b2 dt , (38)\n\nwhere we have only worked to linear order in \u03bb. Note that we have further chosen an ADMlike foliation of the boundary metric, with shift vectors related to angular momentum.\nFurthermore, given the unit normal, it is straightforward to compute the extrinsic curvature\ntensor from the four-dimensional metric:\n\u0398ab = \u2212 12 (\u2207a nb + \u2207b na ) = \u2212 12 nr \u2202r hab = \u2212 21 e\u2212U f (1 + grU \u2032\u03bbN) \u2202r hab .\n13\n\n(39)\n\n\fTo compute the counterterm contributions in (37), we also need the superpotential and\nthe Ricci curvature of the boundary metric (38). Since r may be taken as constant with\nrespect to the four-dimensional metric, its intrinsic curvature has a simple form, with only\nthe S 3 being curved. In other words, we have\nRtt = 0,\n\nR\u03b1\u03b2 = 2r \u22122 e\u22122U (1 \u2212 grU \u2032 \u03bbN)h\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\nRt\u03b1 = 0,\n\n(tot)\n\nIn addition, using (4) and the form of XI\n\n(40)\n\ngiven in (34), the superpotential has the form\n\nW = 3gVI X I = 3g(1 \u2212 21 gr\u03bbN\u2202r )(VI X I ) = 3g(1 \u2212 21 gr\u03bbN\u2202r )[e2U (1 + rU \u2032 )].\n\n(41)\n\nTo proceed, we now need to specify the functional form of U(r). Although in some cases\n(such as the STU model) a closed-form expression may be given for U, here it is sufficient\nfor us to assume that U has an expansion in inverse powers of r 2 of the form\nU=\n\n\u03b11 \u03b12\n+ 4 + ***.\nr2\nr\n\n(42)\n\nIn this case, \u0398ab , Rab and W given in (39), (40) and (41) may be expanded for large r and\ninserted into (37). We find, to lowest non-trivial order\n8\u03c0G5 Ttt\n8\u03c0G5 Tt\u03b1\n\n!\n\n3\ng\n= \u2212 2 6\u03b11 (1 + 21 g\u03bbN) + 2 ,\nr\n8g\n\u0011\ng \u0010\n= \u2212 2 6\u03b11 \u03bbK\u0302\u03b1 .\nr\n\n(43)\n\nNote that there is also a contribution to T\u03b1\u03b2 , which we have not computed (since it has no\nr\u00f4le to play in extracting conserved charges).\nWe must now extract the energy and angular momentum from the above expressions for\nthe boundary stress tensor. To obtain the charge Q\u03be associated with a Killing vector \u03be, we\ntake\nQ\u03be = \u2212 r\u2192\u221e\nlim\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd3 \u03b8 \u03b3(ua Tab \u03be b ),\n\n(44)\n\nwhere u defines the unit normal time direction, and \u03b3 is the induced metric for a constant\ntime slice. For the metric (38), this expression takes the form\n\u03c93 r 2\n(Tta \u03be a ),\nr\u2192\u221e g\n\nQ\u03be = \u2212 lim\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03c93 = 2\u03c0 2 is the volume of the unit 3-sphere. In particular, conjugate to the Killing\nvector \u03be =\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202t\n\nwe obtain the energy\n2\u03c0 2 r 2\n\u03c0\n3\nE = \u2212 lim\n6\u03b11 (1 + 12 g\u03bbN) + 2 .\nTtt =\nr\u2192\u221e\ng\n4G5\n8g\n!\n\n14\n\n(46)\n\n\fTo obtain the angular momentum, we must consider some properties of Killing vectors\non the unit 3-sphere. In general, the unit S 3 admits a set of SO(4) Killing vectors, which\nwe may denote K\u0302\u03b1(ij) , where ij is an antisymmetric SO(4) index pair. These Killing vectors\nmay be normalized according to\nZ\n\nq\n\nd3 \u03b8 \u011d K\u0302\u03b1(ij) K\u0302 (lm) \u03b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b4 il \u03b4 jm \u2212 \u03b4 im \u03b4 jl \u03c93 .\n\n(47)\n\nOn the other hand, the Killing vector K\u0302 \u03b1 constructed from Killing spinors in (30) is naturally\ngiven as an SU(2)\u2212 Killing vector, corresponding to the decomposition SO(4) = SU(2)+ \u00d7\nSU(2)\u2212 . In particular, Killing vectors corresponding to SU(2)+ and SU(2)\u2212 arise from\n\u2020 \u03b1\n\u2020 \u03b1\n\u2020 \u03b1\n\u03c3\u0302 \u03b7\u2212 ) depends on the explicit Killing\n\u03c3\u0302 \u03b7\u2212 ), respectively. While K\u0302 \u03b1 \u2261 (\u03b7\u2212\n\u03c3\u0302 \u03b7+ ) and (\u03b7\u2212\n(\u03b7+\n\nspinor \u03b7\u2212 , we may always choose coordinates such that K\u0302 \u03b1 is aligned along the T 3 direction\nof SU(2). For the unit S 3 given in (15), this corresponds to taking\nK\u0302 \u03b1 =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\n= K\u0302 (12) \u03b1 + K\u0302 (34) \u03b1 ,\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202\u03c8\n\n(48)\n\nwhere we have identified \u03c6 and \u03c8 with rotations in the 1-2 and 3-4 planes, respectively. This\nalso agrees with the natural embedding of SU(2)\u00b1 in SO(4). Using these expressions in (44),\nwe now read off the angular momentum\nr2\nr\u2192\u221e g\n\nJ ij = \u2212 lim\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd3 \u03b8 \u011dTt\u03b1 K\u0302 (ij) \u03b1 =\n\n3\u03b11 \u03bb\n4\u03c0G5\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd3 \u03b8 \u011d K\u0302\u03b1 K\u0302 (ij) \u03b1 ,\n\n(49)\n\nso that\nJ 12 = J 34 =\n\n\u03c0\n(3\u03b11 \u03bb).\n4G5\n\n(50)\n\nWe should note that, while these definitions for energy and angular momentum were\nobtained for AdS black holes, they exactly match their Minkowski black hole counterparts\nin the case where the black hole is \"small.\" When we say that the black hole is small, we\nmean that all length scales associated with it are small compared to the radius of AdS. In\nsuch a case there is a region of space such that gr \u226a \u03b4< , \u03b1k /r 2k \u226a \u03b4> , \u03b4< \u226a \u03b4> \u226a 1. The\nblack hole's energy and angular momentum may then be read off from the metric using a\nstandard ADM prescription; these expressions should furthermore agree with the above (up\nto the Casimir energy, which is absent in the ADM mass). In fact, we would have chosen\nthe definitions of the conserved charges in such a way as to have this happen (by modifying\nthem with multiplicative constants). The fact that they do agree merely confirms that we\nhave defined them in an appropriate manner.\n15\n\n\fB.\n\nThe R-charge and magnetic dipole moment\n\nThe conserved gauge charges are straightforward to obtain, and do not require a counterterm prescription. Based on the Maxwell equation of motion from (2), we obtain the\nconserved Noether (electric) charges\n1\nQI = lim\nr\u2192\u221e \u03c93\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd3 \u03b8 \u2212g GIJ F J rt .\n\nNow, we simply note that the first order corrections in \u03bb to\n\n\u221a\n\n(51)\n\n\u2212g GIJ , when contracted with\n\nF J rt , fall off too fast to contribute. The only modification to the charge of the superpartners\ntherefore comes from a direct shift in A. From (34), we obtain\nQI = qI \u2212 9VI \u03b11 \u03bbN,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere qI were the original black hole electric charges, given in (10).\nFor BPS states, we are more specifically interested in the R-charge, given as the electric\ncharge of A\u03bc = VI AI\u03bc . In this case, we may simply read off the R charge from VI AIt :\nVI AIt = 1 \u2212\n\n2\u03b11\n(1 \u2212 23 g\u03bbN) + * * * .\nr2\n\n(53)\n\nIdentifying this expression with Q/(2r 2) (up to the constant, which is pure gauge), we obtain\nQ = \u22124\u03b11 (1 \u2212 32 g\u03bbN).\n\n(54)\n\nFinally, we may also read off the graviphoton magnetic dipole moment from\nVI AI\u03b1 =\n\n\u03b11 \u03bb\n\u03b11 \u03bb\nK\u0303\u03b1 = 2 (K\u0302\u03b1(12) + K\u0302\u03b1(34) ).\n2\nr\nr\n\n(55)\n\nIdentifying this with \u2212 21 \u03bcij K\u0302\u03b1(ij) r \u22122 yields\n\u03bc12 = \u03bc34 = \u2212\u03b11 \u03bb,\n\n(56)\n\nfor the magnetic dipole moment \u03bcij . We will discuss the relation between these charges in\nthe next section.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nGiven the above construction of BPS black hole superpartners in AdS5 , and the further\ndetermination of their conserved charges, we now demonstrate that the structure of the\n16\n\n\fsuperpartners is consistent with representation theory. In particular, we have worked in\nthe context of gauged D = 5, N = 2 supergravity, with superalgebra SU(2, 2|1). Recall\nthat highest weight representations [15, 16] (see also Appendix B of [17]) may be labeled\nby D(E0 , j1 , j2 ; r) where the lowest energy E0 , spins j1 and j2 , and R-charge r label the\ncompact bosonic subalgebra\nSU(2, 2|1) \u2283 SO(2, 4) \u00d7 U(1) \u2283 SO(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1).\n\n(57)\n\nThis superalgebra allows for two types of short multiplets (chiral and non-chiral) in addition\nto ordinary long multiplets. The long multiplets generically contain 24 = 16 states, while\nthe short ones contain 22 = 4 states. The non-chiral multiplets are of the form\nD(E0 = 2j + 1, j, j; 0) = D(E0 , j, j)0 + D(E0 + 12 , j + 12 , j)\u22121\n+D(E0 + 12 , j, j + 21 )1 + D(E0 + 1, j + 21 , j + 12 )0 , (58)\nwhile the chiral ones are\nD(E0 = 23 r, j, 0, r) = D(E0 , j, 0)r + D(E0 + 21 , j + 12 , 0)r\u22121\n+D(E0 + 21 , j \u2212 12 , 0)r\u22121 + D(E0 + 1, j, 0)r\u22122,\nD(E0 = \u2212 32 r, 0, j, r) = D(E0 , 0, j)r + D(E0 + 21 , 0, j + 12 )r+1\n+D(E0 + 21 , 0, j \u2212 12 )r+1 + D(E0 + 1, 0, j)r+2.\n\n(59)\n\nSince the BPS black holes of [12] carry non-zero R-charge, they ought to correspond to the\nchiral short multiplet given above. To see this, we identify the energy, angular momentum\nand R-charge obtained in the previous section as\nE=\n\n\u03c0\n(6\u03b11 + 3g\u03b11\u03bbN + 83 g \u22122 ),\n4G5\n\nJ 12 = J 34 =\n\n\u03c0\n3\u03b11 \u03bb,\n4G5\n\nQ = \u22124\u03b11 + 6g\u03b11 \u03bbN,\n(60)\n\nRemoving the Casimir energy from E, and dropping the prefactor \u03c0/4G5 = \u03c93 /8\u03c0G5 from\ngravitational quantities, we see that the appropriate identification of SU(2, 2|1) quantum\nnumbers is as follows:\nE0 = 6\u03b11 + 3g\u03b11 \u03bbN,\n\nj1 = 0,\n\nj2 = 3\u03b11 \u03bb,\n\nr = \u22124\u03b11 + 6g\u03b11\u03bbN.\n\n(61)\n\nSetting \u03bb = 0 for the original bosonic solution then yields\nD(E0 , 0, 0)r ,\n\nE0 = \u2212 23 r = 6\u03b11 ,\n17\n\n(62)\n\n\fcorresponding to the lowest weight component of D(E0 = \u2212 23 r, 0, j = 0, r) given in (59).\nTurning now to the superpartners, we first note from (14) that \u03b50 satisfies a projection\n\u03c32 \u03b50 = \u2212\u03b50 . Hence this two-component Majorana spinor in fact has only one independent\nreal component, which may be taken as an unimportant real multiplicative constant in the\nproduct \u01eb = \u03b50 \u00d7\u03b7\u2212 . In other words, the interesting fermion zero mode algebra arises from the\nKilling spinors \u03b7\u2212 on the sphere, and not from \u03b50 itself. Based on standard representation\ntheory techniques, we see that this algebra is essentially that of fermionic creation and\nannihilation operators. Thus we view the two-component Dirac spinor \u03b7\u2212 and its conjugate\n\u2020\n\u03b7\u2212\nas a pair of creation and annihilation operators\n\n\u2020\n\u03b7\u2212\n\n=\n\n( a\u2020\u2191\n\na\u2020\u2193\n\n),\n\n\u03b7\u2212 =\n\na\u2191\na\u2193\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(63)\n\nwith corresponding number operator\n\u2020\nN = (\u03b7\u2212\n\u03b7\u2212 ) = a\u2020\u2191 a\u2191 + a\u2020\u2193 a\u2193 = n\u2191 + n\u2193 .\n\n(64)\n\nOf course, given the semi-classical analysis of the previous sections, the normalization of\nthese operators is not so obvious. Fortunately, we have just seen that the parameter \u03bb,\ndefined in (33) as \u03bb = 4(\u03b5\u03040 \u03b50 ), is an ordinary c-number. Thus we simply assume that the\nblack hole superpartners with non-vanishing spin will be normalized so that j2 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(actually\n\nthe third component of j2 ). This corresponds to setting 6\u03b11 \u03bb = 1 in (61). To be somewhat\nmore precise, there are actually two independent sets of creation and annihilation operators,\nas indicated in (63). In this case, the third component of angular momentum j2 in the\nsecond SU(2) may be either 'spin up' or 'spin down', depending on the choice of Killing\nspinors \u03b7\u2212 used to construct the Killing vector K\u0302 \u03b1 . In fact, from (30), we may write down\n\u2020 3\nT 3 \u2261 12 (\u03b7\u2212\n\u03c3 \u03b7\u2212 ) = 21 (a\u2020\u2191 a\u2191 \u2212 a\u2020\u2193 a\u2193 ) = 12 (n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ).\n\n(65)\n\nWe now see that the choice of Killing vector in (48) is overly restrictive. As a consequence,\ninstead of having j2 = 3\u03b11 \u03bb in (61), we ought to write m2 = 6\u03b11 \u03bbT 3 with T 3 given in (65),\nwhere m2 is the third component of j2 .\nGiven the above considerations, we see that the superpartner quantum numbers read off\nfrom (61) fit the representations\nD(E0 + 21 gN, 0, m2 = T 3 )r+gN ,\n18\n\nE0 = \u2212 23 r,\n\n(66)\n\n\fwhere N = n\u2191 + n\u2193 and T 3 = 21 (n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ). Note here that the spin j2 is given implicitly\nin terms of the angular momentum representations |j2 , m2 i. Since the number operators n\u2191\nand n\u2193 independently take on the values 0, 1, we identify precisely the 4 states of the short\nmultiplet. In particular, we have N = 0, 1, 2, with corresponding spins j2 = 0, 21 , 0. As the\ndimensionful quantities E0 and r are measured with respect to the AdS inverse radius g,\nthe above expression is in complete agreement with the chiral short representation of (59)\nwith superspin j = 0. Thus we have demonstrated that, in fact, working to second order\nin the supersymmetry transformations is sufficient to reproduce the appropriate zero mode\nalgebra of the corresponding supersymmetry algebra.\n\nA.\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio\n\nFollowing [2, 3], we may also compute the gyromagnetic ratio of the black hole superpartners. Here we make use of the definition\n\u03bcij =\n\ng\u0303Q ij\nJ ,\n2M\n\n(67)\n\nwhere g\u0303 denotes the gyromagnetic ratio (to distinguish it from the inverse AdS radius). The\nmagnetic dipole moment was identified in (56) to be\n\u03bc12 = \u03bc34 = \u2212\u03b11 \u03bb,\n\n(68)\n\nwhich is clearly proportional to the angular momentum J12 = J34 = (\u03c0/4G4 )3\u03b11 \u03bb given in\n(50). To compute the gyromagnetic ratio, we further use the mass and charge of the original\nbosonic solution, M = (\u03c0/4G5 )6\u03b11 and Q = \u22124\u03b11 to obtain\ng\u0303(\u22124\u03b11 )\n(\u2212\u03b11 \u03bb) =\n2(\u03c0/4G5)6\u03b11\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\n3\u03b11 \u03bb ,\n4G5\n\u0013\n\n(69)\n\nwhich yields g\u0303 = 1. This agrees with the asymptotically Minkowski case previously obtained\nin [18]. We use the mass and charge of the original system because Jij and \u03bcij were only\ncalculated to leading order.\nThis result appears somewhat surprising, as it was proven in [19, 20] that unbroken\nsupersymmetry in four dimensions is sufficient to ensure that g\u0303 is exactly equal to 2 for the\nsuperspin-0 multiplet. In this case, the situation is somewhat different, as we are working in\nfive dimensions and furthermore with the anti-de Sitter superalgebra. It turns out, however,\n19\n\n\fthat it is not the AdS nature of the system that leads to g\u0303 6= 2, but rather just the simple\nfact that g\u0303 = 1 is natural in five dimensions, at least for superpartners of non-rotating black\nholes [18]. While N = 2 supersymmetry shares many common features between four and\nfive dimensions, there are differences as well. Consider, for example, the minimal (ungauged)\nsupergravity multiplet (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c8\u03bc , A\u03bc ), with supersymmetry transformation\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03bc = [\u2207\u03bc + 8i (\u03b3\u03bc \u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 2(D \u2212 3)\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03c1 )F\u03bd\u03c1 ]\u01eb,\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = \u01ed\u03b3(\u03bc \u03c8\u03bd) ,\ni\n\u03b4A\u03bc = \u2212 D\u22123\n\u01ed\u03c8\u03bc ,\n\n(70)\n\nnormalized in either D = 4 or D = 5 according to [\u03b41 , \u03b42 ]\u03a6 = 12 (\u01ed1 \u03b3 \u03bc \u01eb2 )\u2202\u03bc \u03a6 + * * *, with \u03a6 any\nof the fields in the multiplet. This system admits BPS (Reissner-Nordstrom) black holes of\nthe form\nds2 = \u2212H\u22122 dt2 + H2/(D\u22123) d~y 2 ,\nA(1) =\n\n2\nH\u22121 dt.\nD\u22123\n\n(71)\n\nFor a spherically symmetrical black hole with harmonic function H = 1+q/r D\u22123, application\nof the techniques of [1, 2, 3] to generate superpartners yields\n\u03b4\u03b4gti = (\u01edi\u03b3i j \u01eb)x\u0302j\n\n(D \u2212 2)q\n,\n2r D\u22122\n\n\u03b4\u03b4Ai = (\u01edi\u03b3i j \u01eb)x\u0302j\n\nq\n.\n(D \u2212 3)r D\u22122\n\n(72)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a fermion zero mode spinor. After extracting then angular momentum and\nmagnetic moment from these expressions, and inserting them into (67), we obtain\n2\ng\u0303 =\n=\nD\u22123\n\n(\n\n2 for D = 4,\n1 for D = 5.\n\n(73)\n\nSo we see that g\u0303 = 1 is actually expected in five dimensions, regardless of whether the\nbackground is AdS or Minkowski. Noting that g\u0303 = 1 is the natural value in both IIA theory\nin ten dimensions and maximal supergravity in eight dimensions [3], it rather appears that\ng\u0303 = 2 is a unique feature of four dimensions.\nFinally, we note that while we have focused on the stationary BPS solutions of [12],\nthey actually have singular horizons or naked singularities in the context of the STU model.\nWhile this is a rather undesirable feature, our present analysis is unaffected by such singularities, as we only depend on the asymptotics away from the singularity. It would, however,\n20\n\n\fbe worthwhile to extend the fermion zero mode construction to the case of the recently constructed supersymmetric AdS5 black holes supported by rotation [21, 22]. In addition, while\nto our knowledge this method has only been applied to the generation of superpartners of\nparticle-like representations, nothing prevents it from being extended to more general backgrounds with partially broken supersymmetry. It would be of particular interest to examine\nthe fermion zero modes in the recently constructed 1/2 BPS backgrounds [23, 24], and to\nexplore the r\u00f4le they may play in the AdS/CFT context.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis project had its origins in earlier discussions with M.
