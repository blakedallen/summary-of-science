We give a partly new proof of the fluctuation bounds for the second class\nparticle and current in the stationary asymmetric simple exclusion process. One novelty\nis a coupling that preserves the ordering of second class particles in two systems that are\nthemselves ordered coordinatewise.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a Markov process that describes\nthe motion of particles on the one-dimensional integer lattice Z. Each particle executes a\ncontinuous-time nearest-neighbor random walk on Z with jump rate p to the right and q to\nthe left. Particles interact through the exclusion rule which means that at most one particle\nis allowed at each site. Any attempt to jump onto an already occupied site is ignored. The\nasymmetric case is p 6= q. We assume 0 \u2264 q < p \u2264 1 and also p + q = 1.\nIn this paper we give a partially new proof of the fluctuation bounds for ASEP first\nproved in [1] and [2]. For a more thorough explanation of the context and related work we\nrefer the reader to these earlier papers. The present paper has two novelties.\n(i) Both the earlier and the present approach are based on identities that link together\nthe current, space-time covariances, and the second class particle. In [2] we proved these\nidentities with martingale techniques and generator computations. Section 2 of the present\npaper shows that these identities are consequences of not much more than simple counting of\nparticles. These arguments are elementary and should work very generally. Without much\neffort we extend the identities to more general exclusion dynamics that allow bounded jumps\nand rates that depend on the local configuration. However, product invariant distributions\nremains a key assumption.\n(ii) In [1] we used sophisticated couplings introduced in [4] and some complicated estimation to bound the positions of certain second class particles. In Section 3 of the present\npaper we introduce a coupling for ASEP that keeps the second class particle of a denser system behind the second class particle of a comparison system. Since the macroscopic speed\nof a second class particle is H \u2032 (\u03c1), the slope of the flux at the given density \u03c1, concavity of\nDate: October 26, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 60K35.\nKey words and phrases. exclusion process, particle current, second class particle, coupling, variance\nbound, moment bound, fluctuations.\nM.

SEPP\u00c4L\u00c4INEN\n\nthe flux suggests that second class particles travel slower in a denser system. Since this is\nwhat the coupling achieves, we think of this coupling as a form of microscopic concavity.\nFix two parameters 0 \u2264 q < p \u2264 1 such that p + q = 1. We run quickly through the\nfundamentals of (p, q)-ASEP. We refer the reader to standard references for further details\n[6, 7].\nDefinition and graphical construction. ASEP represents the motion of particles\non the integer lattice Z. The particles are subject to an exclusion rule which means that\neach site of Z can contain at most one particle. The state of the system at time t is a\nconfiguration \u03b7(t) = (\u03b7i (t))i\u2208Z \u2208 {0, 1}Z of zeroes and ones. The value \u03b7i (t) = 1 means\nthat site i is occupied by a particle at time t, while the value \u03b7i (t) = 0 means that site i is\nvacant at time t.\nThe motion of the particles is controlled by independent Poisson processes (Poisson\nclocks) {N i\u2192i+1 , N i\u2192i\u22121 : i \u2208 Z}. Each Poisson clock N i\u2192i+1 has rate p and each N i\u2192i\u22121\nhas rate q. If t is a jump time for N i\u2192i+1 and if (\u03b7i (t\u2212), \u03b7i+1 (t\u2212)) = (1, 0) then at time t\nthe particle from site i moves to site i + 1 and the new values are (\u03b7i (t), \u03b7i+1 (t)) = (0, 1).\nSimilarly if t is a jump time for N i\u2192i\u22121 a particle is moved from i to i\u22121 at time t, provided\nthe configuration at time t\u2212 permits this move. If the jump prompted by a Poisson clock\nis not permitted by the state of the system, this jump attempt is simply ignored and the\nparticles resume waiting for the next prompt coming from the Poisson clocks.\nThis construction of the process is known as the graphical construction or the Harris\nconstruction. When the initial state is a fixed configuration \u03b7, P \u03b7 denotes the distribution\nof the process.\nWe write \u03b7, \u03c9, etc for elements of the state space {0, 1}Z , but also for the entire process\nso that \u03b7-process stands for {\u03b7i (t) : i \u2208 Z, 0 \u2264 t < \u221e}. The configuration \u03b4i is the state\nthat has a single particle at position i but otherwise the lattice is vacant.\nInvariant distributions. A basic fact is that i.i.d. Bernoulli distributions {\u03bd \u03c1 }\u03c1\u2208[0,1]\nare extremal invariant distributions for ASEP. For each density value \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1], \u03bd \u03c1 is the\nprobability measure\non {0, 1}Z under which the occupation variables {\u03b7i } are i.i.d. with\nR\ncommon mean \u03b7i d\u03bd \u03c1 = \u03c1. When the process \u03b7 is stationary with time-marginal \u03bd \u03c1 , we\nwrite P \u03c1 for the probability distribution of the entire process. The stationary density-\u03c1\nprocess means the ASEP \u03b7 that is stationary in time and has marginal distribution \u03b7(t) \u223c\n\u03bd\u03c1 .\nBasic coupling and second class particles. The basic coupling of two exclusion processes \u03b7 and \u03c9 means that they obey a common set of Poisson clocks {N i\u2192i+1 , N i\u2192i\u22121 }.\nSuppose the two processes \u03b7 and \u03b7 + satisfy \u03b7 + (0) = \u03b7(0) + \u03b4Q(0) at time zero, for some\n+\n(0) = 1 and\nposition Q(0) \u2208 Z. This means that \u03b7i+ (0) = \u03b7i (0) for all i 6= Q(0), \u03b7Q(0)\n\u03b7Q(0) (0) = 0. Then throughout the evolution in the basic coupling there is a single discrepancy between \u03b7(t) and \u03b7 + (t) at some position Q(t): \u03b7 + (t) = \u03b7(t) + \u03b4Q(t) . From the\nperspective of \u03b7(t), Q(t) is called a second class particle. By the same token, from the\nperspective of \u03b7 + (t) Q(t) is a second class antiparticle. In particular, we shall call the pair\n(\u03b7, Q) a (p, q)-ASEP with a second class particle.\nWe write a boldface P for the probability measure when more than one process are\ncoupled together. In particular, P\u03c1 represents the situation where the initial occupation\n\n\fFLUCTUATIONS FOR ASEP\n\n3\n\nvariables \u03b7i (0) = \u03b7i+ (0) are i.i.d. mean-\u03c1 Bernoulli for i 6= 0, and the second class particle\nQ starts at Q(0) = 0.\nMore generally, if two processes \u03b7 and \u03c9 are in basic coupling and \u03c9(0) \u2265 \u03b7(0) (by which\nwe mean coordinatewise ordering \u03c9i (0) \u2265 \u03b7i (0) for all i) then the ordering \u03c9(t) \u2265 \u03b7(t) holds\nfor all 0 \u2264 t < \u221e. The effect of the basic coupling is to give priority to the \u03b7 particles over\nthe \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7 particles. Consequently we can think of the \u03c9-process as consisting of first class\nparticles (the \u03b7 particles) and second class particles (the \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7 particles).\n\nCurrent. For x \u2208 Z and t > 0, Jx (t) stands for the net left-to-right particle current\nacross the straight-line space-time path from (1/2, 0) to (x+1/2, t). More precisely, Jx (t) =\nJx (t)+ \u2212 Jx (t)\u2212 where Jx (t)+ is the number of particles that lie in (\u2212\u221e, 0] at time 0 but\nlie in [x + 1, \u221e) at time t, while Jx (t)\u2212 is the number of particles that lie in [1, \u221e) at time\n0 and in (\u2212\u221e, x] at time t. When more than one process (\u03c9, \u03b7, etc) is considered in a\ncoupling, the currents of the processes are denoted by Jx\u03c9 (t), Jx\u03b7 (t), etc.\nFlux and characteristic speed. The average net rate at which particles in the stationary (p, q)-ASEP at density \u03c1 move across a fixed edge (i, i + 1) is the flux\n(1.1)\n\nH(\u03c1) = (p \u2212 q)\u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03c1).\n\nThe characteristic speed at density \u03c1 is\n(1.2)\n\nV \u03c1 = H \u2032 (\u03c1) = (p \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 2\u03c1).\n\nIn the stationary process the expected current is\n(1.3)\n\nE \u03c1 [Jx (t)] = tH(\u03c1) \u2212 x\u03c1\n\nas can be seen by noting that particles that crossed the edge (0, 1) either also crossed (x, x+\n1) and contributed to Jx (t) or did not. Another important and less obvious expectation is\n(1.4)\n\nE\u03c1 [Q(t)] = tH \u2032 (\u03c1)\n\nfor the second class particle that starts at the origin. We derive (1.4) in Section 2.\nWe can now state the main result, the moment bounds on the second class particle.\nTheorem 1.1.

The boundary dependence on \u03c1 is as follows: as \u03c1 \u2192 {0, 1},\nC1 (\u03c1) \u2192 \u221e, C2 (\u03c1) \u2192 0 and t0 (\u03c1) \u2192 \u221e.

L. Ferrari and Spohn [5] proved a distributional limit for the current J\u230aV \u03c1 t\u230b (t). At the\ntime of this writing this precise distributional limit has not yet been proved for ASEP. If\nthe observer chooses a speed V 6= V \u03c1 then Var\u03c1 [J\u230aV t\u230b (t)] is of order t and in fact J\u230aV t\u230b (t)\nsatisfies a central limit theorem that records Gaussian fluctuations of the initial particle\nconfiguration [3].\nOrganization of the paper. Section 2 proves the identities that connect the current\nand the second class particle. In Section 3 we develop the coupling that keeps two second\nclass particles in different densities ordered.

For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 R let pk and\nqk be functions of particle configurations that depend only on coordinates (\u03c9i : \u2212R \u2264 i \u2264 R)\nand satisfy 0 \u2264 pk (\u03c9), qk (\u03c9) \u2264 1.

Bernoulli distributions {\u03bd \u03c1 }\u03c1\u2208[0,1] are invariant for the process. As\nthroughout the paper, P \u03c1 , E \u03c1 , Var\u03c1 and Cov\u03c1 refer to the density-\u03c1 invariant process.\n\nWe state formulas that tie together the current, space-time covariance (also called \"twopoint function\"), and the second class particle. We begin with the well-known formula that\nconnects the two-point function with the second class particle.\nLet P\u03c1 be the probability distribution of two coupled processes \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c9 + that start with\nidentical Bernoulli-\u03c1 occupation variables \u03c9i (0) = \u03c9i+ (0) at i 6= 0 and a single discrepancy\nQ that starts at the origin. In other words Q(0) = 0 and \u03c9 + (t) = \u03c9(t) + \u03b4Q(t) . Then for\n0<\u03c1<1\n(2.1)\n\nCov\u03c1 [\u03c9j (t), \u03c90 (0)] = \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03c1)P\u03c1 {Q(t) = j}.\n\nNote that the two sides of the identity come from different processes: the left-hand side\nis a covariance in a stationary process, while the right-hand side is in terms of processes\nperturbed at the origin at time 0. For the sake of completeness we give below a proof of\n(2.1).\nTheorem 2.1. For any density 0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1, z \u2208 Z and t > 0 we have these formulas:\nX\n|j \u2212 z| Cov \u03c1 [\u03c9j (t), \u03c90 (0)] = \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03c1)E\u03c1 |Q(t) \u2212 z|.\n(2.2)\nVar\u03c1 [Jz (t)] =\nj\u2208Z\n\nand\n(2.3)\n\nd \u03c1\nE [Jz (t)] = E\u03c1 [Q(t)] \u2212 z.\nd\u03c1\n\nThe terms in the series in (2.2) decay exponentially in |j|, uniformly over \u03c1. All members\nof these identities are continuous functions of \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1]. At \u03c1 = 0 and \u03c1 = 1 the left-hand\nside of (2.3) is a one-sided derivative.\nSome comments and consequences follow.\nAt \u03c1 = 0 the second class particle Q(t) is a random walk that takes jumps of size k at\nrate pk (\u03b40 ) and jumps of size \u2212k at rate qk (\u03b40 ). At the other extreme, \u03c1 = 1, Q(t) is a\nrandom walk that takes jumps of size k at rate qk (1 \u2212 \u03b4\u2212k ) and jumps of size \u2212k at rate\npk (1 \u2212 \u03b4k ). Here 1 denotes the configuration \u03c9 \u2261 1. In particular, in (p, q)-ASEP, as \u03c1 goes\nfrom 0 to 1, Q interpolates between nearest-neighbor random walks with rates (p, q) and\n(q, p).\nThe equilibrium current past the origin satisfies\n(2.4)\n\nE \u03c1 [J0 (t)] = tH(\u03c1)\n\nwhere the flux H(\u03c1) is the expected rate of particle motion across any fixed edge in the\nstationary density-\u03c1 process:\nH(\u03c1) =\n\nR\nX\nk=1\n\nkE \u03c1 (pk \u2212 qk ).\n\n\f6\n\nM.

The second equality in (2.2) comes\nfrom (2.1).\nLet \u03c9 be a stationary exclusion process satisfying the assumptions made in this section,\nwith i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u03c1) distributed occupations {\u03c9i (t)} at any fixed time t.

Let \u03b7 a,b and \u03b7 N,a,b be exclusion processes\ndefined from initial conditions\n(2.9)\n\n\u03b7ia,b (0) = \u03c9i (0)1{a<i<b}\n\nand\n\n\u03b7iN,a,b (0) = \u03c9iN (0)1{a<i<b}\n\nand with a \"reduced\" Poisson construction: all Poisson jumps that involve any site outside (a, b) are deleted. The point of this definition is that for disjoint intervals (a, b) and\n(u, v), processes \u03b7 a,b and \u03b7 u,v are independent because they do not share initial occupation\nvariables or Poisson clocks.\nWe write P for the probability measure under which all these coupled processes {\u03c9, \u03c9 N ,\na.b\n\u03b7 , \u03b7 N,a,b } live. The next lemma is valid for completely general initial occupations {\u03c9i (0)}.\nLemma 2.2. Let {\u03c9i (0)} be an arbitrary deterministic or random initial configuration,\nand define initial configurations \u03c9 N (0), \u03b7 a,b (0) and \u03b7 N,a,b (0) by (2.6) and (2.9). For a fixed\n0 < t < \u221e there is a constant C(t) < \u221e such that, for all indices N , m, k, and all times\ns \u2208 [0, t]\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nE|\u03c9kN (s) \u2212 \u03b7kN,k\u2212m,k+m(s)| \u2264 e\u2212C(t)m\n\nand\n\nE|\u03c9k (s) \u2212 \u03b7kk\u2212m,k+m (s)| \u2264 e\u2212C(t)m .\n\nProof. We give the argument for a particular N and k. But the argument and the resulting\nbound have no dependence on N , k or the initial configurations. The only issue is the\ndisconnectedness of the graph created by the Poisson clocks in the Harris construction\nduring time interval [0, t].\nFor any given integer i > 0, there is a fixed positive probability that no site in the\nintervals [k \u2212 i \u2212 R + 1, k \u2212 i] and [k + i, k + i + R \u2212 1] is involved in any Poisson jump during\ntime interval [0, t]. Hence the probability that this event fails at each integer i = 3Rl for\n1 \u2264 l \u2264 n is exponentially small in n. (For distinct l the clocks involved are independent.)\nIf this event succeeds for i = 3Rl, then \u03c9kN (s) = \u03b7kN,k\u2212m,k+m(s) for all m \u2265 3Rl + R\nand s \u2208 [0, t] by the following reasoning. This m is large enough to ensure that the initial\nconfigurations \u03c9 N (0) and \u03b7 N,k\u2212m,k+m(0) agree on (k \u2212 i \u2212 R, k + i + R). The absence of\nPoisson jumps has frozen the configurations in (k \u2212 i \u2212 R, k \u2212 i] \u222a [k + i, k + i + R) up to time\nt. Also, up to time t no Poisson jump connects the process inside the interval (k \u2212 i, k + i)\nto the outside. The rates of the jumps inside the interval (k \u2212 i, k + i) are determined by the\nconfiguration in the larger interval (k \u2212 i \u2212 R, k + i + R). Consequently inside (k \u2212 i, k + i),\nup to time t, the processes \u03c9 N and \u03b7 N,k\u2212m,k+m execute the same moves.\n\u0003\nNow combine the previous lemma with independent initial occupations.\n\n\f8\n\nM.

Similar argument for the left derivative at \u03c1 = 1 completes the proof of identity (2.3). The\ncontinuity of the right-hand side of (2.3) was also argued along the way.\n3. A coupling for microscopic concavity\n\nAs observed in (2.5) the speed of the second class particle in a density-\u03c1 ASEP is H \u2032 (\u03c1).\nThus by the concavity of the flux H a defect travels slower in a denser system (recall that\nwe assume p > q throughout). However, in ASEP the basic coupling does not respect\nthis, except in the totally asymmetric (p = 1, q = 0) case. To see this, consider two\npairs of processes (\u03c9 + , \u03c9) and (\u03b7 + , \u03b7) such that both pairs have one discrepancy: \u03c9 + (t) =\n\u03c9(t) + \u03b4Q\u03c9 (t) and \u03b7 + (t) = \u03b7(t) + \u03b4Q\u03b7 (t) . Assume that \u03c9(t) \u2265 \u03b7(t).

The idea is to think of a single \"special\" second\nclass particle as performing a random walk on the process of \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7 second class particles.\nThis coupling preserves the expected ordering of the special second class particles, hence it\ncan be regarded as a form of microscopic concavity.\nThis theorem summarizes the outcome.\nTheorem 3.1. Assume given two initial configurations {\u03b6i (0)} and {\u03bei (0)} and two not\nnecessarily distinct positions Q\u03b6 (0) and Q\u03be (0) on Z. Suppose the coordinatewise ordering\n\u03b6(0) \u2265 \u03be(0) holds, Q\u03b6 (0) \u2264 Q\u03be (0), and \u03b6i (0) = \u03bei (0) + 1 for i \u2208 {Q\u03b6 (0), Q\u03be (0)}. Define the\nconfiguration \u03b6 \u2212 (0) = \u03b6(0) \u2212 \u03b4Q\u03b6 (0) .\nThen there exists a coupling of processes (\u03b6 \u2212 (t), Q\u03b6 (t), \u03be(t), Q\u03be (t))t\u22650 with initial state\n\u2212\n(\u03b6 (0), Q\u03b6 (0), \u03be(0), Q\u03be (0)) given in the previous paragraph, such that both pairs (\u03b6 \u2212 , Q\u03b6 )\nand (\u03be, Q\u03be ) are (p, q)-ASEP's with a second class particle, and Q\u03b6 (t) \u2264 Q\u03be (t) for all t \u2265 0.\nTo begin the construction, put two exclusion processes \u03b6 and \u03be in basic coupling, obeying\nPoisson clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 }. They are ordered so that \u03b6 \u2265 \u03be. The \u03b6 \u2212 \u03be second class particles\nare labeled in increasing order * * * < Xm\u22121 (t) < Xm (t) < Xm+1 (t) < * * * . We assume there\nis at least one such second class particle, but beyond that we make no assumption about\n\n\f12\n\nM. BAL\u00c1ZS AND T. SEPP\u00c4L\u00c4INEN\n\ntheir number. Thus there is some finite or infinite subinterval I \u2286 Z of indices such that\nthe positions of the \u03b6 \u2212 \u03be second class particles are given by {Xm (t) : m \u2208 I}.\nWe introduce two dynamically evolving labels a(t), b(t) \u2208 I in such a manner that Xa(t) (t)\nis the position of a second class antiparticle in the \u03b6-process, Xb(t) (t) is the position of a\nsecond class particle in the \u03be-process, and the ordering\n(3.1)\n\nXa(t) (t) \u2264 Xb(t) (t)\n\nis preserved by the dynamics.\nThe labels a(t), b(t) are allowed to jump from m to m \u00b1 1 only when particle Xm\u00b11 is\nadjacent to Xm . The labels do not take jump commands from the Poisson clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 }\nthat govern (\u03be, \u03b6). Instead, the directed edges (i, i + 1) and (i, i \u2212 1) are given another\ncollection of independent Poisson clocks so that the following jump rates are realized.\n(i) If a = b and Xa+1 = Xa + 1 then\n(\n(a, b + 1)\nwith rate p \u2212 q\n(a, b) jumps to\n(a + 1, b + 1) with rate q.\n(ii) If a = b and Xa\u22121 = Xa \u2212 1 then\n(\n(a \u2212 1, b)\n(a, b) jumps to\n(a \u2212 1, b \u2212 1)\n\nwith rate p \u2212 q\nwith rate q.\n\n(iii) If a 6= b then a and b jump independently with these rates:\n(\na + 1 with rate q if Xa+1 = Xa + 1\na jumps to\na \u2212 1 with rate p if Xa\u22121 = Xa \u2212 1;\n(\nb + 1 with rate p if Xb+1 = Xb + 1\nb jumps to\nb \u2212 1 with rate q if Xb\u22121 = Xb \u2212 1.\nLet us emphasize that the pair process (\u03be, \u03b6) is still governed by the old clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 }\nin the basic coupling. The new clocks that realize rules (i)\u2013(iii) are not observed except\nwhen sites {i, i + 1} are both occupied by X-particles and at least one of Xa or Xb lies in\n{i, i + 1}.\nFirst note that if initially a(0) \u2264 b(0) then jumps (i)\u2013(iii) preserve the inequality a(t) \u2264\nb(t) which gives (3.1). (Since the jumps in point (iii) happen independently, there cannot\nbe two simultaneous jumps. So it is not possible for a and b to cross each other with a\n(a, b) \u2192 (a + 1, b \u2212 1) move.)\nDefine processes \u03b6 \u2212 (t) = \u03b6(t) \u2212 \u03b4Xa(t) (t) and \u03be + (t) = \u03be(t) + \u03b4Xb(t) (t) . In other words, to\nproduce \u03b6 \u2212 remove particle Xa from \u03b6, and to produce \u03be + add particle Xb to \u03be. The second\nkey point is that, even though these new processes are no longer defined by the standard\ngraphical construction, distributionwise they are still ASEP's with second class particles.\nWe argue this point for (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ) and leave the argument for (\u03be, Xb ) to the reader.\nLemma 3.2. The pair (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ) is a (p, q)-ASEP with a second class particle.\nProof. We check that the jump rates for the process (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ), produced by the combined\neffect of the basic coupling with clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 } and the new clocks, are the same jump\n\n\fFLUCTUATIONS FOR ASEP\n\n13\n\nrates that result from defining an (ASEP, second class particle) pair in terms of the graphical\nconstruction as explained in the Introduction.\nTo have notation for the possible jumps, let 0 denote an empty site, 1 a \u03b6 \u2212 -particle, and\n2 particle Xa . Consider a fixed pair (i, i + 1) of sites and write xy with x, y \u2208 {0, 1, 2, } for\nthe contents of sites (i, i + 1) before and after the jump. Then here are the possible moves\nacross the edge {i, i + 1}, and the rates that these moves would have in the basic coupling.\nType 1\n\n10 \u2212\u2192 01 with rate p\n01 \u2212\u2192 10 with rate q\n\nType 2\n\n20 \u2212\u2192 02 with rate p\n02 \u2212\u2192 20 with rate q\n\nType 3\n\n12 \u2212\u2192 21 with rate p\n21 \u2212\u2192 12 with rate q\n\nOur task is to check that the construction of (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ) actually realizes these rates.\nJumps of types 1 and 2 are prompted by the clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 } of the graphical construction\nof (\u03be, \u03b6), and hence have the correct rates listed above.\nJumps of type 3 occur in two distinct ways.\n(Type 3.1) First there can be a \u03be-particle next to Xa , and then the rates shown above\nare again realized by the clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 } because in the basic coupling the \u03be-particles have\npriority over the X-particles.\n(Type 3.2) The other alternative is that both sites {i, i + 1} are occupied by X-particles\nand one of them is Xa . The clocks {N i\u2192i\u00b11 } cannot interchange the X-particles across the\nedge {i, i+1} because in the (\u03be, \u03b6)-graphical construction these are lower priority \u03b6-particles\nthat do not jump on top of each other. The otherwise missing jumps are now supplied by\nthe \"new\" clocks that govern the jumps described in rules (i)\u2013(iii).\nCombining (i)\u2013(iii) we can read that if Xa = i + 1 and Xa\u22121 = i, then a jumps to a \u2212 1\nwith rate p. This is the first case of type 3 jumps above, corresponding to a \u03b6 \u2212 -particle\nmoving from i to i + 1 with rate p, and the second class particle Xa yielding. On the other\nhand, if Xa = i and Xa+1 = i + 1 then a jumps to a + 1 with rate q. This is the second case\nin type 3, corresponding to a \u03b6 \u2212 -particle moving from i + 1 to i with rate q and exchanging\nplaces with the second class particle Xa .\nWe have verified that the process (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ) operates with the correct rates.\nTo argue from the rates to the correct distribution of the process, we can make use of\nthe process (\u03b6 \u2212 , \u03b6). The processes (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ) and (\u03b6 \u2212 , \u03b6) determine each other uniquely. The\nvirtue of (\u03b6 \u2212 , \u03b6) is that it has a compact state space and only nearest-neighbor jumps with\nbounded rates. Hence by the basic theory of semigroups and generators of particle systems\nas developed in [6], given the initial configuration, the distribution of the process is uniquely\ndetermined by the action of the generator on local functions. Thus it suffices to check that\nindividual jumps have the correct rates across each edge {i, i + 1}. This is exactly what we\ndid above in the language of (\u03b6 \u2212 , Xa ).\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nM. BAL\u00c1ZS AND T. SEPP\u00c4L\u00c4INEN\n\nSimilar argument shows that (\u03be, Xb ) is a (p, q)-ASEP with a second class particle. To\nprove Theorem 3.1 take Q\u03b6 = Xa and Q\u03be = Xb . This gives the coupling whose existence is\nclaimed in the theorem.\nTo conclude, let us observe that the four processes (\u03be, \u03be + , \u03b6 \u2212 , \u03b6) are not in basic coupling.\nFor example, the jump from state\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8ee\n\u03b6i \u03b6i+1\n1 1\n1 1\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \uf8fa \uf8ef0 1\uf8fa\n\uf8fa to state \uf8ef1 0\uf8fa\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8ef i+ i+1\n+ \uf8fb=\uf8f0\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\u03be\n0 1\uf8fb\n1 0\n\u03bei+1\ni\n0 0\n0 0\n\u03bei \u03bei+1\n\nhappens at rate q (second case of rule (i)), while in basic coupling this move is impossible.\n4. Biased random walk in an inhomogeneous environment\n\nThis section proves an estimate that is needed for the proof of Theorem 1.1. Let Z(t)\nbe a continuous-time nearest-neighbor random walk on state-space S \u2286 Z that contains\nZ\u2212 = {. . . , \u22122, \u22121, 0}. Initially Z(0) = 0. Z attempts to jump from x to x + 1 with rate\np for x \u2264 \u22121, and from x to x \u2212 1 with rate q for x \u2264 0. Assume p > q = 1 \u2212 p and let\n\u03b8 = p \u2212 q. The rates on S r Z\u2212 need not be specified.\nWhether jumps are permitted or not is determined by a fixed environment expressed in\nterms of {0, 1}-valued functions {u(x, t) : x \u2208 S, 0 \u2264 t < \u221e}. A jump across edge {x \u2212 1, x}\nin either direction is permitted at time t if u(x, t) = 1, otherwise not. In other words, u(x, t)\nis the indicator of the event that edge {x \u2212 1, x} is open at time t.\n\nAssumption. Assume that for all x \u2208 S and T < \u221e, u(x, t) flips between 0 and\n1 only finitely many times during 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T . Assume for convenience right-continuity:\nu(x, t+) = u(x, t).\nLemma 4.1. For all t \u2265 0 and k \u2265 0,\n\nP {Z(t) \u2264 \u2212k} \u2264 e\u22122\u03b8k .\n\nThis bound holds for any fixed environment {u(x, t)} subject to the assumption above.\nProof. Let Y (t) be a walk that operates exactly as Z(t) on Z\u2212 but is rectricted to remain\nin Z\u2212 by setting the rate of jumping from 0 to 1 to zero. Give Y (t) geometric initial\ndistribution\n\u0010\nq \u0011\u0010 q \u0011j\nfor j \u2265 0.\nP {Y (0) = \u2212j} = \u03c0(j) \u2261 1 \u2212\np p\nThe initial points satisfy Y (0) \u2264 Z(0) a.s. Couple the walks through Poisson clocks so that\nthe inequality Y (t) \u2264 Z(t) is preserved for all time 0 \u2264 t < \u221e.\nWithout the inhomogeneous environment Y (t) would be a stationary, reversible birth\nand death process. We argue that even with the environment the time marginals Y (t) still\nhave distribution \u03c0. This suffices for the conclusion, for then\n\u0001\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\u2264 e\u22122\u03b8k .\nP {Z(t) \u2264 \u2212k} \u2264 P {Y (t) \u2264 \u2212k} = (q/p)k = exp k log 1+\u03b8\nTo justify the claim about Y (t), consider approximating processes Y (m) (t), m \u2208 N, with\nthe same initial value Y (m) (0) = Y (0). Y (m) (t) evolves so that the environments {u(x, t)}\nrestrict its motion only on edges {x \u2212 1, x} for \u2212m + 1 \u2264 x \u2264 0. In other words, for walk\n\n\fFLUCTUATIONS FOR ASEP\n\n15\n\nY (m) (t) we set u(x, t) \u2261 1 for x \u2264 \u2212m and 0 \u2264 t < \u221e. We couple the walks together so\nthat Y (t) = Y (m) (t) until the first time one of the walks exits the interval {\u2212m + 1, . . . , 0}.\nFixing m for a moment, let 0 = s0 < s1 < s2 < s3 < . . . be a partition of the time axis\nso that sj \u0580 \u221e and the environments {u(x, t) : \u2212m < x \u2264 0} are constant on each interval\nt \u2208 [si , si+1 ). Then on each time interval [si , si+1 ) Y (m) (t) is a continuous time Markov\nchain with time-homogeneous jump rates\n(\npu(x + 1, si ), \u2212m \u2264 x \u2264 0\nc(x, x + 1) =\np,\nx \u2264 \u2212m \u2212 1\nand\n\n(\nqu(x, si ), \u2212m + 1 \u2264 x \u2264 0\nc(x, x \u2212 1) =\nq,\nx \u2264 \u2212m.\n\nOne can check that detailed balance \u03c0(x)c(x, x + 1) = \u03c0(x + 1)c(x + 1, x) holds for all\nx \u2264 \u22121. Thus \u03c0 is a reversible measure for walk Y (m) (t) on each time interval [si , si+1 ),\nand we conclude that Y (m) (t) has distribution \u03c0 for all 0 \u2264 t < \u221e.\nThe coupling ensures that Y (m) (t) \u2192 Y (t) almost surely as m \u2192 \u221e, and consequently\nalso Y (t) has distribution \u03c0 for all 0 \u2264 t < \u221e.\n\u0003\n5.

Since \u230au\u230b \u2265 u/2 for u \u2265 1, (5.3)\nextends from integers u to real u by an adjustment of the constant C.\nFix a density 0 < \u03c1 < 1 and an auxiliary density 0 < \u03bb < \u03c1 that will vary in the\nargument. Start with the basic coupling of three exclusion processes \u03c9 \u2265 \u03c9 \u2212 \u2265 \u03b7 with this\ninitial set-up:\n(a) Initially {\u03c9i (0) : i 6= 0} are i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u03c1) distributed and \u03c90 (0) = 1.\n(b) Initially \u03c9 \u2212 (0) = \u03c9(0) \u2212 \u03b40 .\n\n\f16\n\nM. BAL\u00c1ZS AND T. SEPP\u00c4L\u00c4INEN\n\n(c) Initially variables {\u03b7i (0) : i 6= 0} are i.i.d. Bernoulli(\u03bb) and \u03b70 (0) = 0. The coupling\nof the initial occupations is such that \u03c9i (0) \u2265 \u03b7i (0) for all i 6= 0.\nRecall that basic coupling meant that these processes obey common Poisson clocks.\nLet Q(t) be the position of the single second class particle between \u03c9(t) and \u03c9 \u2212 (t),\ninitially at the origin. Let {Xi (t) : i \u2208 Z} be the positions of the \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7 second class\nparticles, initially labeled so that\n* * * < X\u22122 (0) < X\u22121 (0) < X0 (0) = 0 < X1 (0) < X2 (0) < * * *\n\nThese second class particles preserve their labels in the dynamics and stay ordered. Thus\nthe \u03c9(t) configuration consists of first class particles (the \u03b7(t) process) and second class\nparticles (the Xj (t)'s). P denotes the probability measure under which all these coupled\nprocesses live. Note that the marginal distribution of (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2212 , Q) under P is exactly as it\nwould be under P\u03c1 .\nFor x \u2208 Z, Jx\u03c9 (t) is the net current in the \u03c9-process between space-time positions (1/2, 0)\nand (x + 1/2, t). Similarly Jx\u03b7 (t) in the \u03b7-process, and Jx\u03c9\u2212\u03b7 (t) is the net current of second\nclass particles. Current in the \u03c9-process is a sum of the first class particle current and the\nsecond class particle current:\n(5.4)\n\nJx\u03c9 (t) = Jx\u03b7 (t) + Jx\u03c9\u2212\u03b7 (t).\n\nQ(t) is included among the {Xj (t)} for all time because the basic coupling preserves the\ncoordinatewise ordering \u03c9 \u2212 (t) \u2265 \u03b7(t). Define the label mQ (t) by Q(t) = XmQ (t) (t) with\ninitial value mQ (0) = 0. We insert a bound on the label.\nLemma 5.2. For all t \u2265 0 and k \u2265 0,\n\nP{mQ (t) \u2265 k} \u2264 e\u22122\u03b8k .\n\nProof of Lemma 5.2. In the basic coupling the label mQ (t) evolves as follows. When XmQ \u22121\nis adjacent to XmQ , mQ jumps down by one at rate p. And when XmQ +1 is adjacent to XmQ ,\nmQ jumps up by one at rate q. When XmQ has no X-particle in either neighboring site,\nthe label mQ cannot jump. Thus the situation is like that in Lemma 4.1 (with a reversal\nof lattice directions) with environment given by the adjacency of X-particles: u(m, t) =\n1{Xm (t) = Xm\u22121 (t) + 1}. However, the basic coupling mixes together the evolution of the\nenvironment and the walk mQ , so the environment is not specified in advance as required\nby Lemma 4.1.\nWe can get around this difficulty by imagining an alternative but distributionally equivalent construction for the joint process (\u03b7, \u03c9 \u2212 , \u03c9). Let (\u03b7, \u03c9) obey basic coupling with the\ngiven Poisson clocks {N x\u2192x\u00b11 } attached to directed edges (x, x \u00b1 1). Divide the \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7\nparticles further into class II consisting of the particles \u03c9 \u2212 \u2212 \u03b7 and class III that consists\nonly of the single particle \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 = \u03b4Q . Let class II have priority over class III. Introe x\u2192x\u00b11 }, also attached to directed edges\nduce another independent set of Poisson clocks {N\ne x\u2192x\u00b11 } govern the exchanges\n(x, x \u00b1 1) of the space Z where particles move. Let clocks {N\ne x\u2192x+1 and\nbetween classes II and III. In other words, for each edge {x, x + 1} clocks N\ne x+1\u2192x are observed if sites {x, x + 1} are both occupied by \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7 particles. All other\nN\njumps are prompted by the original clocks.\n\n\fFLUCTUATIONS FOR ASEP\n\n17\n\nThe rates for individual jumps are the same in this alternative construction as in the\nearlier one where all processes were together in basic coupling. Thus the same distribution\nfor the process (\u03b7, \u03c9 \u2212 , \u03c9) is created.\nTo apply Lemma 4.1 perform the construction in two steps. First construct the process\n(\u03b7, \u03c9) for all time. This determines the environment u(m, t) = 1{Xm (t) = Xm\u22121 (t) + 1}.\nThen run the dynamics of classes II and III in this environment. Now Lemma 4.1 gives the\nbound for mQ .\n\u0003\nThe preliminaries are ready and we begin to develop a series of inequalities. Let u and\nk be positive integers.\n(5.5)\n\nP{Q(t) \u2265 V \u03c1 t + u}\n\n\u03b7\n\u03c9\n\u2264 P{mQ (t) \u2265 k} + P{J\u230aV\n\u03c1 t\u230b+u (t) \u2212 J\n\u230aV \u03c1 t\u230b+u (t) > \u2212k}.\n\nTo explain the inequality above, if Q(t) \u2265 V \u03c1 t + u and mQ (t) < k then Xk (t) > \u230aV \u03c1 t\u230b + u.\nThis puts the bound\n\u03c9\u2212\u03b7\nJ\u230aV\n\u03c1 t\u230b+u (t) > \u2212k\n\non the second class particle current, because at most particles X1 , . . . , Xk\u22121 could have\nmade a negative contribution to this current.\nLemma 5.2 takes care of the first probability on line (5.5). We work on the second\nprobability on line (5.5).\nHere is a simple observation that will be used repeatedly. Process \u03c9 can be coupled\nwith a stationary density-\u03c1 process \u03c9 (\u03c1) so that the coupled pair (\u03c9, \u03c9 (\u03c1) ) has at most 1\ndiscrepancy.

Define an auxiliary density \u03bb = \u03c1 \u2212 bt\u22121/3 . Fix t0 \u2265 1\nand large enough so that \u03bb \u2208 (\u03c1/2, \u03c1) for t \u2265 t0 .

Q(\u2212n) (t) is the location of the unique discrepancy\nbetween \u03b7(t) and \u03b7 + (t).\n(c) Initially \u03b6 has independent occupation variables, coupled with \u03b7(0) as follows:\n\n\f22\n\nM.

Bernoulli(\u03c1) and \u03b6i (0) \u2265 \u03b7i (0).\nThus the initial density of \u03b6 is piecewise constant: on the segment {\u2212n + 1, . . . , 0} \u03b6(0)\nis i.i.d. with density \u03bb, at site \u2212n \u03b6(0) has density 1, and elsewhere on Z \u03b6(0) is i.i.d. with\ndensity \u03c1.\nLabel the \u03b6 \u2212 \u03b7 second class particles as {Ym (t) : m \u2208 Z} so that initially\n\n* * * < Y\u22121 (0) < Y0 (0) = \u2212n = Q(\u2212n) (0) < 0 < Y1 (0) < Y2 (0) < * * *\n\nLet again mQ (t) be the label such that Q(\u2212n) (t) = YmQ (t) (t). Initially mQ (0) = 0. The\ninclusion Q(\u2212n) (t) \u2208 {Ym (t)} persists for all time because the basic coupling preserves the\nordering \u03b6(t) \u2265 \u03b7 + (t). Through the basic coupling mQ jumps to the left with rate q and to\nthe right with rate p, but only when there is a Y -particle adjacent to YmQ . As in the proof\nof Lemma 5.2 we can apply Lemma 4.1 to prove this statement:\nLemma 5.6.
