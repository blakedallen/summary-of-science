Introduction\nHigh energy, small angle, scattering has always been the subject of much attention, since the\nearly days of elementary particle physics. While the phenomenological Regge theory, centered\naround the 'soft Pomeron', has met with considerable success in reproducing the experimental\ndata for hadronic collisions, a fundamental understanding of this theory rooted in QCD is still\nlacking and seems to even transcend our present capabilities - as neither perturbative QCD,\nnor lattice gauge theory, can be applied in the relevant 'Regge kinematics' (high energy, but soft\nmomentum transfer).\nIn perturbative QCD, the resummation of the logarithmically enhanced diagrams leads to\nthe BFKL, or 'hard', Pomeron [1] which predicts a power\u2013like growth with s for the gluon occupation number and the scattering amplitudes. The growth is however faster than observed\nin experiments, and is also problematic from a conceptual point of view as it violates unitarity.\nWithin the past decade there has been considerable activity and some important progress towards understanding the unitarization of the BFKL Pomeron within pQCD. These efforts have\nbeen mainly oriented in two directions: (i) the calculation [2] and proper implementation [3] of\nthe next\u2013to\u2013leading order corrections to the linear BFKL equation, and (ii) the inclusion of the\nnon\u2013linear effects, like multiple scattering and gluon saturation, responsible for the unitarization\nof the scattering amplitudes [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nWhereas weak coupling techniques are undoubtedly useful for the high\u2013energy problems\nwhich involve, at least, one hard momentum scale - so like deep inelastic scattering at small x\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fand large photon virtuality Q2 (s \u226b Q2 \u226b \u039b2QCD ), or hadronic scattering with large momentum\ntransfer (s \u226b |t| \u226b \u039b2QCD ) -, on the other hand it remains unclear whether such approaches\n2\ncan shed any light on the 'soft' (|t| <\n\u223c \u039bQCD ) aspects of Regge phenomenology. For instance, is\nthere any relation between the soft and the hard Pomerons, and if so, then how to describe the\ntransition between the two ? Such questions are particularly difficult because of our inability to\nexplore the transitive region where the QCD coupling constant becomes strong. It is therefore\ninteresting to study model field theories which are analytically accessible at strong coupling and\nwhich share some of the basic features of QCD at high energy - like the existence of a partonic\ndescription at weak coupling and a Regge\u2013like behavior at high energy, for any value of the\ncoupling.\nN = 4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills (SYM) theory with 'color' gauge group SU(Nc ) and the\n't Hooft coupling constant \u03bb = g 2 Nc treated as a free parameter offers a particularly interesting\ntheoretical laboratory for this purpose. At weak coupling, the high energy behavior is just like in\nperturbative QCD - in particular, to lowest order, the BFKL equation is formally identical in\nQCD and N = 4 SYM [10] - while at strong coupling and in the large Nc limit the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence [11] maps the theory onto a weakly coupled superstring theory which naturally\nexhibits Regge behavior (see, e.g., [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]). Such a change of behavior with increasing\nthe coupling strength bears some resemblance to the transition from the hard Pomeron to the\nsoft Pomeron in QCD, although some important differences persists. (For instance, when moving\nfrom weak to strong coupling, the Pomeron intercept decreases in QCD, while it increases in\nthe N = 4 SYM theory.) Thus one can hope that some useful insights for the corresponding\nQCD problems may be gleaned from a study of the Regge regime in N = 4 SYM theory and its\nvariants.\nIn this paper we study deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in strongly coupled N = 4 theory\nat small\u2013x where x \u2243 Q2 /s is the usual Bjorken variable. The basic formulation was given\nby Polchinski and Strassler [15] in the strict large\u2013Nc limit (Nc \u2192 \u221e at fixed energy), where\nhowever no unitarity issue arises: being suppressed by a factor 1/Nc2 , the elementary scattering\namplitude is always smaller than one, and is dominated by the exchange of a single 'Pomeron'.\nIn this strong\u2013coupling context, the 'Pomeron' is the t\u2013channel object exchanged at tree\u2013level\nand at high energy in the dual string theory [16] - a reggeized graviton propagating in the\ncurved space\u2013time that the string theory lives in and which is asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\nThus, in order to study unitarization, one should rather consider the high\u2013energy limit\ns \u2192 \u221e at large, but fixed, values of Nc , and this is what we shall do in this paper. This is again\nsimilar to QCD (at large Nc ), where the unitarity corrections are suppressed by inverse powers\nof Nc , hence a flexible definition of the 'large\u2013Nc limit' is necessary to observe such phenomena.\nThe problem of unitarization in the context of string theory is notoriously difficult, even at weak\n(string) coupling gs2 \u221d 1/Nc2 , because of the need to resum multi\u2013loop string amplitudes to all\norders, and here we shall not attempt to provide a full analysis in that sense (see however the\napproaches in Refs. [12, 17, 18]). Rather, our goal is more modest and also more pragmatic:\nFollowing again the example of weakly\u2013coupled QCD - where it has been shown [19, 20, 21, 22]\nthat one can follow the onset of unitarity corrections via an appropriate extrapolation of the\nresults at weak scattering (in that case, the single BFKL\u2013Pomeron exchange) -, we shall\ncompute, at strong coupling, the saturation line which separates the weak\u2013scattering from the\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fstrong\u2013scattering regions in the kinematical plane (x, Q2 ) for DIS.\nSpecifically, while staying in the weak\u2013scattering regime - which at strong coupling, like\nat weak coupling, corresponds to sufficiently large values of Q2 for a given value x \u226a 1 -,\nwe shall first identify those contributions to the scattering amplitude which become dominant\nwhen extrapolating towards the unitarity limit, and then deduce the saturation line as the curve\nQ2s (x) along which the amplitude is constant and of O(1). What at a first sight may look as\na rather straightforward exercise in unitarizing the single\u2013Pomeron exchange of Refs. [15, 16],\nturns out to be quite subtle, because of several issues:\nFirst, the formulation of the unitarity constraint is rather non\u2013trivial in the context of DIS,\nwhere the scattering is initiated by an off\u2013shell, electromagnetic, current (actually, an R-current\nin N = 4 SYM). Within the context of pQCD, this issue is most conveniently solved by using\nthe dipole factorization of DIS at small x [24, 25], where one can unambiguously identify the\non\u2013shell hadronic state which scatters off the proton, and for which the unitarity bound can\nbe properly formulated: the quark\u2013antiquark excitation of the virtual photon, or 'color dipole'\n(see also Sect. 2 below, and Refs. [26, 27] for more detailed discussions). It turns out that a\nformally similar factorization holds at strong coupling as well, with the color dipole replaced\nby a vector\u2013field fluctuation of the background metric (the 'R-boson'), which propagates on\u2013\nshell before eventually scattering off the 'dilaton' target [15]. This makes it natural to enforce\nthe unitarity constraint at the level of the elementary scattering between the R-boson and the\ndilaton. This constraint will determine our saturation line.\nSecond, unlike what happens in pQCD, where the single (BFKL) Pomeron exchange controls\nthe dipole amplitude in the vicinity of the unitarity limit for all the relevant values of x and\nQ2 , the situation at strong coupling appears to be more complex, and also more interesting:\nthere, the single\u2013Pomeron exchange represents the dominant contribution (when approaching\nthe saturation line, once again) only for sufficiently low values of Q2 , up to a critical value\n\u221a\nQ2c \u221d exp{4 ln Nc2 / \u03bb}. But for Q2 > Q2c , a new mechanism takes up the leading role, namely\nthe diffractive scattering via the exchange of two, or more, elementary (massless) gravitons.\nNote that Q2c \u2192 \u221e in the strict large\u2013Nc limit, which explains why this new mechanism has\nnot been included in the analysis in Ref. [15]. Interestingly, the picture of DIS at high energy\nand Q2 > Q2c that we shall arrive is quite close to that of Regge scattering in superstring theory\nin flat space, as studied by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano [12].\nIn fact, for a strongly\u2013coupled gauge theory having a dual string description, the graviton\nexchange is naturally more effective, at high energy and large Q2 , than the single\u2013Pomeron one:\nthe amplitude for one\u2013graviton exchange grows very fast with the energy, as s \u223c 1/x, because\nthe graviton has spin j = 2, and, moreover, its long\u2013range non\u2013locality can efficiently match\nthe large separation in scales between the highly virtual R-current and the dilaton. (Of course,\nbeing real, the single graviton exchange cannot contribute to the DIS structure functions, but\nmultiple exchanges can do so, via diffractive final states where the outgoing fields are separated\nin rapidity.) The reason why the single\u2013Pomeron exchange is nevertheless found to dominate at\nrelatively low Q2 is because, in the AdS5 geometry, the massless graviton is turned off at very\nshort separations (in the radial direction of AdS5 ), by the curvature of space\u2013time. Or, by the\nholographic principle of AdS/CFT (which becomes manifest in the factorization of DIS alluded\nto above), small separations in AdS5 correspond to low virtualities Q2 on the gauge theory side.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThis transition, from a single\u2013Pomeron to multiple graviton exchanges, with increasing Q2\nhas important consequences on the shape of the saturation line, correspondingly obtained as\nthe juxtaposition of two curves which smoothly match with each other at Q2 = Q2c , and also\non the behaviour of the DIS cross\u2013section in the vicinity of this line. We thus find that, at\nlarge Q2 > Q2c , the structure function F2 (x, Q2 ) is strongly peaked at the saturation momentum\n- namely, F2 \u221d Nc2 Q2 when Q2 < Q2s (x), but F2 \u221d 1/(Nc2 Q2 ) when Q2 \u226b Q2s (x) -, which\nis suggestive of a partonic interpretation with all the partons living at transverse momenta\nk\u22a5 <\noccupation numbers of O(1). This is further supported by an analysis\n\u223c Qs (x) and having\nR\nof the 'sum\u2013rule' dxF2 (x, Q2 ) which expresses the energy\u2013momentum conservation: at large\nQ2 , this sum\u2013rule appears to be saturated by values of x near the saturation line, i.e., the\nlargest values of x at which one can still find the partons. Needless to say, at strong coupling\nsuch a partonic language must be used with care, since the standard relations between structure\nfunctions and parton distributions hold, strictly speaking, only in perturbation theory. It is\nnevertheless interesting that the picture of parton saturation suggested by our analysis appears\nas a natural continuation towards strong coupling of the corresponding results as weak coupling,\nas obtained in pQCD [19, 28, 29, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 27].\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we give a self\u2013contained review of high\u2013\nenergy DIS in QCD at weak coupling, in the framework of dipole factorization. The focus is\non the definition and the construction of the saturation line, with the purpose of facilitating\nthe subsequent discussion at strong coupling, and also the comparison between the weak and,\nrespectively, strong\u2013coupling scenarios. In Section 3, we describe our setup of DIS at strong\ncoupling following [15] and demonstrate a limitation of the single\u2013Pomeron exchange approximation, which fails to saturate the energy\u2013momentum sum rule at large Q2 . This points out\ntowards the importance of the massless graviton exchanges, which are then discussed at length in\nSection 4. On this occasion, we use and extend the 'Pomeron' approach initiated in Refs. [14, 15]\nand more systematically developed in [16], with the purpose of demonstrating the reemergence\nof the massless graviton propagator at large Q2 . We then describe multiple graviton exchanges\nat a heuristic level, using in particular the results in Refs. [12, 17, 18] to deduce the onset of\nunitarity corrections. We summarize our results for the saturation line in a 'phase diagram',\nFig. 3, for gauge theories at high energy and strong 't Hooft coupling, to be compared with the\ncorresponding diagram at weak coupling in Fig. 1. Section 5 is devoted to a discussion of our\nresults, in relation with a possible partonic interpretation.\n\n2. Saturation momentum and geometric scaling in perturbative QCD\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, deep inelastic lepton\u2013hadron scattering (DIS) at relatively\nhigh virtuality Q2 \u226b \u039b2QCD for the exchanged photon and in the high\u2013energy limit s \u226b Q2\nrepresents a rather clean laboratory for a theoretical study of unitarization in the framework\nof perturbative QCD - in particular, for the calculation of the saturation momentum. More\nprecisely, in what follows we shall work in the 'small\u2013x' regime of DIS, characterized by\n1\nQ2\n\u226a 1,\nand\n\u03b1s ln \u2265 1 .\n(2.1)\ns\nx\nA 'lowest\u2013order calculation' in this regime requires an all\u2013order resummation of the perturbative\ncontributions of order (\u03b1s ln(1/x))n , with n \u2265 1. This resummation can be performed by\n\u03b1s \u226a 1,\n\nx \u2261\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fsolving appropriate evolution equations, constructed within pQCD, which are generally non\u2013\nlinear, with the non\u2013linear terms accounting for the 'unitarity corrections' - gluon saturation\nand multiple scattering [4, 5, 7, 8, 30]. However, a linear approximation - the BFKL equation\n[1, 25, 2] - holds within an intermediate range of energies, in which the non\u2013linear effects\nremain parametrically small. The boundary of the validity region for this approximation in the\nkinematical plane (x, Q2 ) is known as the 'saturation line'; this is the curve Q2 = Q2s (x) along\nwhich the scattering amplitude is constant and of order one. Remarkably, it turns out that\nthe position of this line can be determined via calculations based on the BFKL approximation\nalone, without a detailed knowledge of the non\u2013linear dynamics responsible for unitarization\n[20, 21, 22]. In what follows, we shall briefly review this calculation to 'leading\u2013logarithmic\naccuracy' (LLA), i.e., at the level of the leading\u2013order BFKL equation. (See also Ref. [31, 32]\nfor more accurate analyses, including NLO effects.)\nTo LLA, the cross\u2013sections in QCD at high energy can be computed within a factorization\nscheme known as 'kT \u2013factorization' (see [33, 26]), which is consistent with the non\u2013locality of the\nhigh\u2013energy evolution in transverse coordinates. When applied to DIS, this is most suggestively\nwritten as dipole factorization : the virtual photon \u03b3 \u2217 fluctuates into a quark\u2013antiquark pair in\na color\u2013singlet state, or 'color dipole', which then scatters off the gluon field inside the target.\nMore precisely, the DIS structure function F2 is computed as\nF2 (x, Q2 ) =\n\nQ2\n\u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p (Q2 , x),\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1em\n\nwith \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p the total \u03b3 \u2217 p cross\u2013section :\nZ 1 Z\nX\n2\ndz d2 r\n|\u03a8a (z, r)|2 \u03c3dipole (r, x),\n\u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p (Q , x) =\n0\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\na=T,L\n\nwhere the subscript a refers to the polarization of the virtual photon (transverse or longitudinal),\nand \u03a8a (z, r) is the wavefunction describing the dissociation of the virtual photon into a q q\u0304 pair\nwith transverse size r = |r| and where the quark (antiquark) takes away a fraction z (respectively,\n1 \u2212 z) of the photon energy. For massless quarks, one finds [24]\n|\u03a8T (z, r)|2 = F [z 2 + (1 \u2212 z)2 ]Q\u03042 K12 (Q\u0304r),\n|\u03a8L (z, r)|2 = 4F Q2 z 2 (1 \u2212 z)2 K02 (Q\u0304r) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nP\nwhere Q\u03042 \u2261 z(1 \u2212 z)Q2 , K0 and K1 are modified Bessel functions, and F \u2261 (Nc \u03b1em /2\u03c0 2 ) f e2f ,\nwith ef the electric charge of the quark with flavor f . The factor of Nc comes from the sum\nover the color degrees of freedom of the quarks. The integration over r in Eq. (2.3) is effectively\nrestricted to r < 1/Q\u0304 by the Bessel functions, which are exponentially suppressed for Q\u0304r \u226b 1.\nFurthermore, Eq. (2.3) involves the total cross\u2013section \u03c3dipole (x, r) for the scattering between\na color dipole with transverse size r and the hadronic target. For the present purposes, it is\nconvenient to take the target itself as a collection of dipoles, succinctly referred to as the onium.\nIn its own rest frame, the onium is a collection of dipoles with sizes r \u2032 \u2264 R0 distributed according\nto a density function n(r \u2032 ) and which are homogeneously distributed in impact parameter space\nwithin a disk of radius R0 . Note that R0 plays the role of an 'infrared cutoff' for this dipole\ndistribution, in the sense that this is the maximally allowed dipole size. To ensure applicability\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fof perturbation theory, we shall assume that 1/R02 \u226b \u039b2QCD (but this assumption is often relaxed\nin phenomenological studies of DIS, in which case R0 is identified with the proton radius). Also,\nit is convenient to choose Q2 \u226b 1/R02 , in which case the integral in Eq. (2.3) is dominated by\nrelatively small dipole sizes r (for the projectile dipole), such that r \u226a R0 .\nTo the accuracy of interest, the dipole\u2013onium cross\u2013section can be evaluated as\nZ \u221e \u20322\ndr\n\u03c3dipole (r, \u03c4 ) =\n\u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) n(r \u2032 ) ,\n(2.5)\nr \u20322\n0\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2261 ln(1/x) is the 'rapidity' and \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) is the total cross\u2013section for the scattering\nbetween two dipoles with transverse sizes r and r \u2032 separated by a rapidity interval \u03c4 . The dipole\ndensity is chosen as\n\u0012 \u20322 \u0013\u2206\nr\n\u2032\nn(r ) =\n\u0398(R0 \u2212 r \u2032 ),\n(2.6)\nR02\n\nwhere the power \u2206 plays the role of an 'anomalous dimension': indeed, the standard situation in perturbative QCD (at least for sufficiently small r \u2032 ) is \u2206 = 0, corresponding to the\nbremsstrahlung of small dipoles. The associated distribution is not normalizable (it exhibits a\nlogarithmic divergence at r \u2032 \u2192 0), but this poses no problem for the calculation of the cross\u2013\nsection (2.5) since \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) vanishes sufficiently fast when r \u2032 \u2192 0 (see below). A normalizable\nhadronic state would have \u2206 > 0, in which case n(r \u2032 ), once properly normalized, would have the\ninterpretation of the probability density to find a dipole of size r \u2032 in the target. In what follows,\nwe shall consider the cases where \u2206 is positive or zero.\nWe shall soon compute the cross\u2013section (2.5) in the BFKL approximation and then use\nthe result, in association with the unitarity constraint, to deduce an equation for the saturation\nline. In preparation of this, it is useful to open a parenthesis and explain our specific use of\nthe unitarity constraint for the present purposes. (A similar use will be made in the subsequent\nsections in the context of DIS at strong coupling.)\nThe unitarity bound is most easily formulated in terms of the scattering amplitude T (r, b, \u03c4 )\nat fixed impact parameter b. It then reads T (r, b, \u03c4 ) \u2264 1, where the upper bound T = 1 (the\n'black disk limit') describes a situation where the scattering occurs with probability one. Note\nthat we use conventions in which the S\u2013matrix is written as S = 1 \u2212 T , with T a real quantity\nat high energy. (That is, our T corresponds to the imaginary part of the conventionally\u2013defined\n'scattering amplitude', which becomes predominantly imaginary at high energy.) However, the\nprevious formulae, Eqs. (2.3)\u2013(2.5), involve directly the cross\u2013sections, which are obtained from\nR\nthe respective amplitudes after integrating over b : \u03c3dipole (r, \u03c4 ) = 2 d2 b T (r, b, \u03c4 ), etc. The\nunitarity constraint then becomes more subtle: with increasing energy, a cross\u2013section can rise\nindefinitely, even after the 'black disk' limit has been achieved at central impact parameters,\nbecause of the radial expansion of the black disk. This expansion is however quite slow, logarithmic in the energy (to comply with Froissart bound), which is indeed much slower than the\ncorresponding power\u2013like increase of the amplitude in the BFKL regime (see below). Hence, it\nis possible to neglect the Froissart expansion (or, at least, treat this in an adiabatic approxi2\nmation) in a first study of unitarization. Then, the unitarity bound reads \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u2264 2\u03c0r>\n(with r> = max(r, r \u2032 )) for the dipole\u2013dipole scattering, and \u03c3dipole (x, r) \u2264 2\u03c0R02 for the dipole\u2013\nonium one. It is in fact more suggestive to introduce scattering amplitudes averaged over b, e.g.,\nT (r, \u03c4 ) \u2261 \u03c3dipole (r, \u03c4 )/(2\u03c0R02 ), in terms of which the unitarity bound reads simply T \u2264 1.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fWe can now explain our strategy for computing the saturation line: Starting in the regime\nwhere the scattering is weak, T \u226a 1, we compute the (average) scattering amplitude from\nthe solution to the BFKL equation and then extrapolate the result towards the unitarity limit\nT \u223c O(1). The saturation momentum Qs (\u03c4 ) is then obtained via the condition\nT (r, \u03c4 ) \u2243 1\n\nfor\n\nr \u2243 1/Qs (\u03c4 ) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThat is, 1/Qs (\u03c4 ) is the critical dipole size for the onset of unitarity corrections (in the form of\nmultiple scattering) in dipole\u2013target scattering at rapidity \u03c4 [20, 21]. This is also the critical\nmomentum scale for parton saturation in the target wavefunction [19, 28, 29, 6, 9], in a frame\nwhere the target has rapidity \u03c4 : for transverse momenta k\u22a5 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), the gluon occupation numbers saturate at a value ng \u223c 1/(\u03b1s Nc ), which in turn implies that the (anti)quark occupation\nnumbers saturate at a value nq \u223c 1. (Recall that, at small x and relatively low k\u22a5 , the quark\ndistribution is driven by gluons, which dominate the small\u2013x part of the wavefunction.) This\nprofound link between dipole unitarization and gluon saturation in pQCD can be understood as\na consequence of the relation T (\u03c4, r) \u223c \u1fb1s ng (\u03c4, k\u22a5 \u223c 1/r), valid in the BFKL regime, between\nthe dipole amplitude and the gluon occupation number.\nBy using Eq. (2.7) together with the BFKL solutions to be shortly presented, we shall\ncompute the saturation lines for both dipole\u2013dipole, and dipole\u2013onium, scattering. For more\nclarity, let us anticipate here the main conclusions that we shall arrive at: (i) The value of the\nsaturation momentum depends upon the nature of the target, but its evolution with increasing\nenergy does not - the evolution is universal. (ii) The saturation momentum of the onium\ncoincides with that of its 'softest' component - the constituent dipole with maximal size r \u2032 \u223c R0 .\nWe now close the parenthesis and return to the calculation of the cross\u2013section in the\nBFKL approximation. When applied to the dipole\u2013dipole cross\u2013section \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ), the BFKL\nequation [1] reads (with \u1fb1s \u2261 \u03b1s Nc /\u03c0)\nZ\n\u1fb1s\nr2\n\u2202\n\u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) =\nd2 z 2\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\u03c0\nz (r \u2212 z)2\n\b\n\u2212 \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) + \u03c3DD (z, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) + \u03c3DD (|r \u2212 z|, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) .\n(2.8)\n\nThis equation has been written here as an evolution in the projectile size r for a given target\nsize r \u2032 . (Of course, the function \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) is symmetric in r and r \u2032 .) It has a simple physical\ninterpretation: in one evolution step (\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + d\u03c4 ), the dipole r can split into two dipoles,\nwith sizes z and respectively r \u2212 z, which then interact with the target. The 'BFKL kernel'\n\u1fb1s\n2\n2\n2\n2\u03c0 [r /z (r \u2212 z) ] represents the differential probability for such a splitting to occur per unit\nrapidity. To solve Eq. (2.8), we also need an initial condition at low energy (\u03c4 = 0). To the\npresent accuracy, this is computed as the exchange of two gluons, which yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr>\n\u2032\n2 2\n\u03c3DD (r, r , \u03c4 = 0) = 2\u03c0\u03b1s r< 1 + ln\n,\n(2.9)\nr<\nwhere r< = min(r, r \u2032 ) and r> = max(r, r \u2032 ). This cross\u2013section shows 'color transparency' - it\n2 when r \u2192 0 -, meaning that a very small dipole scatters only weakly. By\nvanishes like r<\n<\nusing Eq. (2.9), one can easily check that, for \u03c4 = 0 and r \u226a R0 , the dipole\u2013onium cross\u2013section\n(2.5) is dominated by relatively large target dipoles, with r \u226a r \u2032 \u2264 R0 . (When \u2206 = 0, the large\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fdipoles dominates over the small (r \u2032 < r) ones by a large logarithm ln(R0 /r).) As we shall later\nsee, the feature is preserved by the evolution with increasing \u03c4 .\nThe solution to the BFKL equation with the initial condition (2.9) is most conveniently\nobtained in Mellin space, where it reads\n\u2032\n\n\u03c3DD (r, r , \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03c0\u03b12s r \u20322\n\nZ\n\nC\n\nd\u03b3\n1\n2\n2\u03c0i \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)2\n\n\u0012\n\nr2\nr \u20322\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03b3\n\ne\u03c4 \u03c7(\u03b3)\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere \u03c7(\u03b3) is the eigenvalue of the BFKL kernel in Mellin space, generally referred to as the\nBFKL characteristic function\n\u03c7(\u03b3) = \u1fb1s {2\u03c8(1) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03c8(1 \u2212 \u03b3)},\n\n\u03c8(\u03b3) \u2261 d ln \u0393(\u03b3)/d\u03b3,\n\n(2.11)\n\nand the integration contour C runs parallel to the imaginary axis with 0 < Re(\u03b3) < 1. Note\nthe symmetry property \u03c7(\u03b3) = \u03c7(1 \u2212 \u03b3), which reflects the conformal invariance of the BFKL\nevolution. In view of this, one can check that Eq. (2.10) is symmetric under r \u2194 r \u2032 , as it should.\nThe inverse Mellin transform in Eq. (2.10) can be evaluated via a saddle point approximation, in which the value of the saddle point depends upon the balance between the kinematical\nvariables \u1fb1s \u03c4 and \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 = ln(r \u20322 /r 2 ). Here, we have introduced the logarithmic variables\n\u03c1 \u2261 ln(R02 /r 2 ) and \u03c1\u2032 \u2261 ln(R02 /r \u20322 ) which are convenient for what follows. At this point, the\nreference scale inside the logarithms is arbitrary (it anyway cancels out in the difference \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ),\nbut for later convenience we have chosen it as the onium size R0 .\nConsider first the formal high\u2013energy limit \u1fb1s \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e at fixed \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 (this is formal since\nthe respective solution violates the unitarity bound already for relatively low energies, as we\nshall shortly see). Then the saddle point \u03b30 is determined by the minimum of the characteristic\nfunction :\n\u03c7\u2032 (\u03b30 ) = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03b30 = 1/2 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nand Eq. (2.10) can be evaluated by expanding \u03c7(\u03b3) around \u03b30 , to second order ('diffusion\napproximation'): writing\n\u03b3 = 1/2 \u2212 i\u03bd ,\n\n(2.13)\n\none obtains (notice that \u03c7(1/2 \u2212 i\u03bd) is an even function of \u03bd, by conformal symmetry)\n\u03c7(1/2 \u2212 i\u03bd) = \u03c90 \u2212 D0 \u03bd 2 + O(\u03bd 4 ) with\n\n\u03c90 = 4 ln 2\u1fb1s ,\n\nD0 = 14\u03b6(3)\u1fb1s ,\n\nand then the Gaussian integration over \u03bd can be easily performed to yield\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03c90 \u03c4\n\u0001\nln2 (r 2 /r \u20322 )\n\u2032\n2 e\n2 \u20322 1/2\n\u03c3DD (r, r , \u03c4 ) \u2243 8\u03b1s \u221a\nr r\nexp \u2212\n.\n4D0 \u03c4\n\u03c0D0 \u03c4\n\n(2.14)\n\n(2.15)\n\nThis expression exhibits the 'BFKL Pomeron', i.e., an exponential increase with \u03c4 at fixed r\nand r \u2032 . Clearly, when extrapolated at large \u03c4 , this behaviour violates the unitarity bound.\nFor instance, when r \u223c r \u2032 , this happens at a critical rapidity \u03c4cr \u223c (1/\u03c90 ) ln(1/\u03b12s ), which is\nparametrically not that high. (Recall that the 'high\u2013energy' regime starts only at \u03c4 \u223c 1/\u1fb1s .)\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fIt is nevertheless possible to explore higher rapidities \u03c4 > \u03c4cr while staying within the limits\nof the BFKL approximation provided we evolve along an oblique direction in the kinematical\nplane \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c4 (see also Fig. 1) : when increasing \u03c4 , we should simultaneously increase \u03c1 (i.e.,\ndecrease the ratio r/r \u2032 ), in such a way that the scattering amplitude remains small: T (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u226a\n1. In particular, the saturation line \u03c1 = \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) corresponds to a direction of evolution along which\nthe amplitude is constant and of order one, cf. Eq. (2.7).\nThis also means that, in order to follow the saturation line, one must abandon the symmetry\nbetween the projectile and the target dipoles (r \u2194 r \u2032 ), which has been manifest so far. If the\ntarget dipole size is fixed to r \u2032 , then with increasing \u03c4 we must evolve towards smaller and\nsmaller values for r. It is then natural to write \u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) = 2\u03c0r \u20322 T (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ), where r < r \u2032 and\nthe unitarity bound corresponds to T (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) = 1. The BFKL approximation holds so long as\nT (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u226a 1, but it allows us to approach the saturation line from small r (large \u03c1) values,\nand thus compute the saturation momentum according to Eq. (2.7). To that aim, however,\none cannot rely on the Pomeron saddle point, Eq. (2.12), anymore, rather one must determine\nthe saddle point \u03b3s corresponding to an evolution along the saturation line (\u03c1 = \u03c1s (\u03c4 )). By\ncombining the saddle point condition:\n\u03c4 \u03c7\u2032 (\u03b3s ) = \u2212(\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ) ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nwith the condition that the amplitude (2.10) be approximately constant along the saturation\nline:\n\u03c4 \u03c7(\u03b3s ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3s )(\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ) \u2212 ln(1/\u03b12s ) = 0,\n\n(2.17)\n\n(we have only kept the dominant parametric dependencies upon \u03c4 , \u03c1s and \u03b1s ), one obtains\n1\n\u03c7\u2032 (\u03b3s )\n= \u2212\n\u03c7(\u03b3s )\n1 \u2212 \u03b3s\n\u03c1s (\u03c4, r \u2032 ) = \u03c1\u2032 + vs \u03c4 \u2212\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03b3s \u2248 0.372,\n\nln(1/\u03b12s )\n1 \u2212 \u03b3s\n\nwith\n\nvs \u2261\n\n\u03c7(\u03b3s )\n\u2248 4.883\u1fb1s .\n1 \u2212 \u03b3s\n\n(2.18)\n\n(We have assumed here that \u03c4 , and hence \u03c1s , are large enough for the term ln(1/\u03b12s ) to be\ntreated as a small perturbation.) Note that \u03b3s is a pure number, independent of either \u03c4 or \u1fb1s ,\ncorresponding to the fact that \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) is a straight line, with slope vs \u223c O(\u1fb1s ).\nFor \u03c1 larger than \u03c1s , but not much larger, one can estimate the amplitude by expanding\nEq. (2.10) around \u03b3s : writing \u03b3 = \u03b3s \u2212 i\u03bd, and expanding to second order in \u03bd, one finds\n\u03c4 \u03c7(\u03b3) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c1 \u2212 ln(1/\u03b12s ) \u2243 \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b3s )(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ) \u2212 i\u03bd(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s ) \u2212 Ds \u03c4 \u03bd 2 ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere Ds = \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03b3s )/2 \u2248 24.26\u1fb1s . This limited expansion is valid so long as 1 < \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s \u226a Ds \u03c4 .\nIn this range, the amplitude is obtained by performing the Gaussian integration over \u03bd, as\n\u00011\u2212\u03b3s\n\u001a\n\u001b\nr 2 Q2s\nln2 (r 2 Q2s )\n\u2032\n\u221a\nexp \u2212\nT (r, r , \u03c4 ) \u2243\n,\n(2.20)\n4Ds \u03c4\n\u03c0Ds \u03c4\nwhere the saturation momentum (here, for a target dipole with size r \u2032 )\nQ2s (r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) = (\u03b12s )1/(1\u2212\u03b3s )\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n1 vs \u03c4\ne\nr \u20322\n\n(2.21)\n\n\fappears as the natural reference scale for measuring the projectile dipole size. When viewed as a\nfunction of rQs , the amplitude near saturation, Eq. (2.20), is universal, i.e., independent of the\nspecific properties of the target, but uniquely fixed by the evolution. Note that, in Eq. (2.20),\n\u03b3s plays the role of an anomalous dimension. The evolution of the saturation momentum with\nincreasing \u03c4 , cf. Eq. (2.21), is universal as well, and controlled by the 'saturation exponent'\nvs . The above calculation yields vs \u223c O(1) for \u1fb1s = 0.2 \u00f7 0.3, a rather large value that would\nbe inconsistent with the phenomenology at HERA or RHIC. However, it turns out that, after\ntaking into account the next\u2013to\u2013leading order BFKL corrections [2, 3], this value is reduced to\nvs \u2248 0.3 [31], which is indeed in the ballpark of the various phenomenological analyses (see, e.g.,\n[34, 35, 36] for studies at HERA).\nWe now return to the problem of dipole\u2013onium scattering, cf. Eqs. (2.5)\u2013(2.6), with the\npurpose of computing the corresponding saturation momentum Qs (\u03c4 ). As before, we shall\napproach the saturation line from the weak scattering regime, i.e., from relatively small dipole\nsizes r \u226a 1/Qs (\u03c4 ). This procedure meets with a subtle point though: although the overall\nscattering is, by assumption, weak, T (r, \u03c4 ) \u226a 1, this is not necessarily so for all the individual\ndipoles which compose the onium and which contribute to the convolution in Eq. (2.5). The\nproblem comes from the relatively small dipoles which, according to Eq. (2.21), develop large\nsaturation momenta (meaning that they evolve into 'hot spots' with high gluon density), off\nwhich the projectile dipole can strongly scatter. Hence, when evaluating the contribution of\nsuch small dipoles to the total cross\u2013section, one cannot rely on the BFKL approximation\nanymore. Still, as we shall shortly argue, this brings no serious complication, since, after being\nproperly unitarized, the small dipoles give negligible contributions to the overall cross\u2013section\nin the vicinity of the saturation line.\nTo see this, one can use the following, piecewise, approximation for the dipole\u2013dipole cross\u2013\nsection at high energy,\n\uf8f1\n\u0001\n\uf8f2T r< Qs (r> , \u03c4 ), \u03c4\nfor r< \u226a 1/Qs (r> , \u03c4 )\n2\n(2.22)\n\u03c3DD (r, r \u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u2248 2\u03c0r>\n\uf8f3\n1\nfor r< >\n1/Q\n(r\n,\n\u03c4\n)\n.\ns >\n\u223c\nIn the first line, T (r< Qs (r> , \u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) is the amplitude in the weak scattering regime, as given\nby Eqs. (2.20)\u2013(2.21) after replacing r \u2192 r< and r \u2032 \u2192 r> . The second line represents the\nblack disk regime. The precise transition between these two regimes is not under control,\nbut this is irrelevant for the present purposes. By inserting Eq. (2.22) into Eq. (2.5) and\nperforming the integration over r \u2032 , one can estimate the dipole\u2013onium scattering amplitude\nT (r, \u03c4 ) \u2261 \u03c3dipole (r, \u03c4 )/2\u03c0R02 . The very small target dipoles with r \u2032 < r are easily seen to be\nirrelevant, since their contribution to T (r, \u03c4 ) is of order r 2 /R02 \u226a 1. (Recall that we are only\ninterested in contributions which can approach the unitarity limit T = 1 when r \u2192 1/Qs (\u03c4 ).)\nTo evaluate the contribution of the larger dipoles with r < r \u2032 \u2264 R0 , it is again convenient to use\nlogarithmic variables (\u03c1 \u2261 ln(R02 /r 2 ), etc.), and notice that Eq. (2.18) can be rewritten as\n\u03c1s (\u03c4, r \u2032 ) = \u03c1\u2032 + \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ),\n\n\u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ) \u2261 vs \u03c4 \u2212\n\nln(1/\u03b12s )\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03b3s\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ) represents the saturation momentum for a dipole with the maximal size r \u2032 = R0 .\nWe anticipate here that in the regime of interest we have \u03c1 > \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ). Then the contribution of\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fthe target dipoles with \u03c1\u2032 < \u03c1 (i.e., r \u2032 > r) can be evaluated as\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\nZ s0\n\n\u2032 \u2212(1\u2212\u03b3s )(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 \u2212\u03c1s0 ) \u2212\n\nd\u03c1 e\n\ne\n\n(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 \u2212\u03c1s0 )2\n4Ds \u03c4\n\n\u2212(1+\u2206)\u03c1\u2032\n\ne\n\n+\n\nZ\u03c1\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c1\u2032 e\u2212(1+\u2206)\u03c1 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0\n\n0\n\nwhere the first (second) term in the r.h.s. corresponds to large dipoles which scatters only\nweakly (respectively, to relatively small dipoles for which the unitarity limit has been reached).\nThe first integral in the r.h.s. involves the overall exponential factor\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne(1\u2212\u03b3s )\u03c1 e\u2212(1+\u2206)\u03c1 = e\u2212(\u2206+\u03b3s )\u03c1\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere the exponent \u2206 + \u03b3s is strictly positive in pQCD (recall that \u2206 \u2265 0 and \u03b3s \u2248 0.37). It\nis then easy to check that, so long as \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s0 < 2(\u2206 + \u03b3s )Ds \u03c4 , this integral is dominated by its\nlower limit \u03c1\u2032 = 0, i.e., by target dipoles of the largest possible size r \u2032 \u223c R0 . As for the second\nintegral in Eq. (2.24), this is dominated by its own lower limit, at \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s0 . One thus finds\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n\n(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 )2\n1\n1\ne\u2212(1\u2212\u03b3s )(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 ) e\u2212 4Ds \u03c4 +\ne\u2212(1+\u2206)(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 ) .\n\u2206 + \u03b3s\n\u2206+1\n\n(2.26)\n\nAs just mentioned, \u2206 + \u03b3s > 0, hence the second term in the r.h.s. is exponentially suppressed\nw.r.t. the first one. Thus, finally (up to a slowly varying prefactor),\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u223c e\u2212(1\u2212\u03b3s )(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 ) e\u2212\n\n(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 )2\n4Ds \u03c4\n\nfor\n\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s0 < 2(\u2206 + \u03b3s )Ds \u03c4 ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhich is essentially the same result as for a target made with a single dipole of size R0 (compare\nto Eq. (2.20)). In particular, the saturation momentum of the onium coincides with that of its\nlargest dipole component (cf. Eq. (2.21)) : \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) = \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ), or\nQ2s (\u03c4 ) = (\u03b12s )1/(1\u2212\u03b3s )\n\n1 vs \u03c4\ne .\nR02\n\n(2.28)\n\nThis is quite intuitive: the onium starts to look 'black' as a whole only when a large dipole,\nwhich covers all (or most) of the hadron disk, has evolved into a system with high gluon density\non the resolution scale of the projectile. Smaller dipoles reach the unitarity limit much faster (on\nthat particular resolution scale), but their contributions to the total cross\u2013section are suppressed\nby their small area1 .\nThe high\u2013energy dipole amplitude in Eqs. (2.20) or (2.27) exhibits an interesting structure, which can be better appreciated by comparison with the low\u2013energy amplitude (2.9), or\nthe (purely) BFKL prediction at high energy, Eq. (2.15): Besides the power\u2013law r 2(1\u2212\u03b3s ) with\nanomalous dimension \u03b3s \u2248 0.37, there is also a Gaussian factor describing diffusion in the logarithmic variable \u03c1 \u223c ln(1/r 2 ). This shows that, when increasing \u03c4 , the amplitude gets built\n\u221a\nvia a diffusive process which gets most of its support from the region 0 < \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s < 4Ds \u03c4\nabove the saturation line. For \u03c4 large enough, such that Q2s (\u03c4 ) \u226b \u039b2QCD , this region lies fully\nin the perturbative domain, thus confirming the internal consistency of our present approach.\nThe physics of saturation/unitarization eliminates the symmetric diffusion characteristic of the\n(pure) BFKL evolution, cf. Eq. (2.15), which would invalidate the use of perturbation theory.\n1\n\nOf course, the physical picture would be different if \u2206 was negative and large enough, in such a way to bias\nthe dipole distribution (2.6) towards small sizes. Then, the onium could become black as a whole (on a given\nresolution scale) by getting covered with many small dipoles which are individually black.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f1\n\u03c4 = ln\nx\n\n\u03c1 = vs\u03c4\n\nSaturation\nGeometric scaling\n\n\u03c1 = vs\u03c4 + 4 Ds\u03c4\n1\n\n\u03b1s\n\nln\n\n1\n\n\u03b1 s2\nBFKL\n\nSingle Pomeron\n\nDGLAP\n\n\u03c1 = ln Q 2 \u039b2\n\nFigure 1: A 'phase diagram' for the high energy evolution in pQCD in the presence of unitarity corrections and gluon saturation. (We recall that \u1fb1s \u2261 \u03b1s Nc /\u03c0.)\n\n\u221a\nIn particular, within the more restricted window \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s \u226a 4Ds \u03c4 (close to the saturation\nline), the diffusion term in Eq. (2.27) can be ignored, and then the amplitude shows geometric\nscaling, i.e., it depends upon r and \u03c4 only via the single variable rQs (\u03c4 ) :\np\n\u00011\u2212\u03b3s\nfor\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1s \u226a 4Ds \u03c4 .\nT (r, \u03c4 ) \u223c e\u2212(1\u2212\u03b3s )(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s ) = r 2 Q2s (\u03c4 )\n(2.29)\n\nThis scaling property is an important consequence of the non\u2013linear dynamics responsible for\nunitarization on the shape of the amplitude in the weak scattering regime 'above saturation'\n(\u03c1 > \u03c1s ). Via the dipole factorization (2.3), this property gets transmitted to the DIS cross\u2013\nsection in the high Q2 regime at Q2 > Q2s (\u03c4 ) :\n\u0012 2 \u00131\u2212\u03b3s\nF2 (Q2 , \u03c4 )\nQs (\u03c4 )\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u223c \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p (Q , \u03c4 ) \u223c Nc R0\nfor Q2s (\u03c4 ) <\n(2.30)\n\u223c Q \u226a Qg (\u03c4 ),\n2\nQ\nQ2\n\u221a\n\nwhere Q2g (\u03c4 ) \u2261 Q2s (\u03c4 )e 4Ds \u03c4 is the upper bound of the scaling window, cf. Eq. (2.29).\nIt is furthermore interesting to note the behaviour of F2 for very small values of Q2 , deeply at\nsaturation (Q2 \u226a Q2s (\u03c4 )). Then, the virtual photon cross\u2013section is dominated by large dipoles,\nwith 1/Q2s (\u03c4 ) < r 2 < 1/Q2 , for which the black disk limit is saturated: \u03c3dipole (r, \u03c4 ) \u2248 2\u03c0R02 .\nOne then finds (the logarithm is generated by the integral over r 2 )\nQ2s (\u03c4 )\nF2 (Q2 , \u03c4 )\n2\n\u223c\nN\nR\nln\nc\n0\nQ2\nQ2\n\nfor\n\nQ2 \u226a Q2s (\u03c4 ),\n\n(2.31)\n\nwhich exhibits geometric scaling too. Remarkably, it turns out that a similar scaling has been\nobserved indeed [35] in the HERA data for DIS at small x \u2264 0.01 and up to relatively large\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fvalues of Q2 \u223c 100 GeV2 (well above the saturation momentum at HERA, estimated in the\nballpark of 1 GeV). The 'phase\u2013diagram' for high energy evolution in pQCD which emerges\nfrom the previous considerations is graphically summarized in Fig. 1.\n\n3. DIS at strong coupling\n3.1 The setup\nWith this section we begin the study of the most interesting problem for us here, namely DIS\nat strong 't Hooft coupling and high energy. Specifically, our physical gauge theory will be a\ndeformation of the N = 4 SYM theory in the regime where the gauge coupling is weak, g \u226a 1,\nbut the number of colors is large, Nc \u226b 1, in such a way that the 't Hooft coupling \u03bb \u2261 g2 Nc\n(the relevant coupling for perturbation theory at large Nc ) is large : \u03bb \u226b 1. The 'deformation'\nrefers to the introduction of an effective infrared cutoff which breaks down conformal symmetry\nand mimics confinement.\nAccording to the AdS/CFT correspondence [11], the N = 4 SYM theory is admitted to\nhave a dual description in terms of the Type IIB string theory living in the 10\u2013dimensional\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 space\u2013time, with the following metric:\nds2 =\n\nR2 2\nu2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(\u2212dx\n+\ndx\n+\ndx\n+\ndx\n)\n+\ndu + R2 d\u03a925 .\n0\n1\n2\n3\nR2\nu2\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn this equation, x0 and x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) are the time and, respectively, three spatial dimensions\nof 'our' physical Minkowski world, u is the AdS5 radial coordinate (0 \u2264 u < \u221e), to be below\nreferred as 'the 5th dimension', and d\u03a925 is the angular measure on S 5 . Furthermore, R is the\ncommon radius of AdS5 and S 5 , and it is related to the string length ls via the 't Hooft coupling\n1\n1\n1\nof the dual gauge field theory: R = ls \u03bb 4 = \u03b1\u2032 2 \u03bb 4 , with \u03b1\u2032 \u2261 ls2 the Regge slope. The physical,\n4\u2013dimensional, space is identified with the boundary of AdS5 at u \u2192 \u221e, where the AdS5 \u2013metric\nbecomes conformal to the standard Minkowski metric \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd . The string coupling constant gs and\nthe gauge coupling g are related to each other as gs = g2 /4\u03c0 = \u03bb/4\u03c0Nc , which shows that in the\n'strong coupling' regime of interest here (\u03bb \u226b 1 but g \u226a 1), the string theory is weakly coupled\nand hence it can be treated in a semi\u2013classical approximation.\nWe have previously mentioned the 'deformation' of the N = 4 SYM theory which is necessary to mimic confinement. In the dual string theory, this translates into a modification of the\nmetric at small u \u223c u0 \u2261 \u039bR2 , where \u039b is a parameter which sets the scale of light hadrons\n('glueballs'). The precise way of modifying the geometry in the infrared is an issue of debate\nwhich we do not enter. (As we shall see, the dominant behaviour at high energy is insensitive\nto such details.) In what follows, we shall simply restrict the 5th coordinate to values u \u2265 u0\n(in practice, we shall be mostly interested in u \u226b u0 ), and assume that the spectrum of the\nsupergravity theory includes states which are localized near u = u0 , corresponding to massive\n'glueballs' on the gauge theory side. Note that, because of the logarithmic nature of the metric\nin u (ds2u \u221d du2 /u2 ), massive 'supergravity' states exhibit power\u2013law decays at large u, to be\nbetter characterized later on.\nTo closely mimic the setup of DIS, we follow [15] and introduce a 'photon' as the gauge boson\nassociated with a gauged U (1) subgroup of the SU (4) R-symmetry. As for the target, we employ\na 'supergravity' glueball of mass \u223c \u039b which originates from the Kaluza\u2013Klein decomposition\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fof the 10 dimensional massless dilaton after compactification on S 5 . Still as in Ref. [15], we\nshall use indices M, N, ... to denote all ten space\u2013time dimensions, separating into \u03bc, \u03bd, ... on\nthe Minkowski boundary at u \u2192 \u221e (our physical space), m, n, ... on AdS5 , and a, b, ... on S 5 .\nIndices are raised or lowered in the standard way, using the metric GM N which can be read\noff Eq. (3.1) : ds2 = GM N dxM dxN . It is understood that for quantities living in the four\u2013\ndimensional gauge theory (and hence also on the Minkowski boundary of AdS5 ), the tensor\noperations are performed with the Minkowski metric \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd = (\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nAs standard in DIS, the structure functions are obtained from the imaginary part of the\nforward Compton scattering amplitude\nZ\ni d4 x eiq*x hP |T {J \u03bc (x)J \u03bd (0)}|P i ,\n(3.2)\nwhere J \u03bc (x) is the density of the R-current and |P i denotes a (normalizable) glueball state\nwith 4\u2013momentum P \u03bc . The hadronic matrix element under the integral will be computed from\nsemi\u2013classical string theory, via the AdS/CFT correspondence. The recipe is as follows :\nThe R-current at the Minkowski boundary (u \u2192 \u221e) excites vector\u2013like metric fluctuations\nin the 'bulk' (i.e., at finite u \u2265 u0 ) :\n\u03b4Gma (x\u03bc , u, \u03a9) = Am (x\u03bc , u)va (\u03a9),\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03a9 denotes the angular coordinates on S 5 , Am (x\u03bc , u) is a gauge boson field, and va is\nthe Killing vector on S 5 corresponding to the gauged U (1) subgroup. At u \u2192 \u221e, the field\nA\u03bc (x\u03bc , \u221e) can be identified as the physical photon which couples to the R-current. This will\nbe taken in the form A\u03bc (x\u03bc , \u221e) = n\u03bc eiq*x , with space\u2013like four\u2013vector q \u03bc : Q2 \u2261 q \u03bc q\u03bc > 0.\nBut inside the bulk, Am (x\u03bc , u) should be better viewed as a gravitational wave, as it describes\na fluctuation in the metric tensor. For definiteness, we shall refer to this field as the 'R-boson'.\nThis R-boson propagates into the bulk until it scatters off the dilaton target - a supergravity\nstate with wavefunction\n\u03a8(x\u03bc , u, \u03a9) = eiP *x \u03a6(u, \u03a9).\n\n(3.4)\n\nNote that this is a plane wave with four\u2013momentum P \u03bc in the four physical dimensions. The\nBjorken\u2013x variable for DIS is defined in the usual way: x \u2261 Q2 /(2P * q). Still as usual, the\nhigh\u2013energy limit (P \u2192 \u221e at fixed Q2 ) corresponds to small values for x (x \u226a 1).\n\u221a\nAs explained in Refs. [15], the Regge behavior starts to be seen when 1/x \u226b \u03bb where\nthe energy is high enough to create excited string intermediate states. To leading order at large\nNc , the string scattering can be computed at tree level, as the imaginary part of the superstring\nVirasoro\u2013Shapiro amplitude for graviton\u2013dilaton scattering [23] (originally calculated in flat\nspace, and heuristically extended to curved space in [15]) convoluted with the supergravity\nwavefunctions for the R-boson (Am ) and the dilaton (\u03a6). The result of [15] can be compactly\nwritten as\n(QR)6\nF2 (x, Q ) = c\u03b1\n\u039b2\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\ndu 1\nK02 (QR2 /u) + K12 (QR2 /u)\n4\nu u\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\u0012 \u00131+ \u03b1\u2032 \u22062\n2\n1\n\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6(u) ,\nx\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fwhere we have absorbed in c a constant coming from the integration over S 5 , as well as powers\nof \u03bb. (For simplicity, we do not keep track of powers of\u221a \u03bb in the prefactor. This is acceptable\nsince we shall deal with an exponentially large factor e \u03bb . See below for details.)\nLet us discuss the various factors under the integral in Eq. (3.5) one after the other:\n(i) The modified Bessel functions K0,1 are a part of the 'R-boson wavefunction'; that is,\nthey arise via the solution Am (x\u03bc , u) to the supergravity equation of motion for the metric perturbation induced by the R-current. This equation is Maxwell equation on AdS5 : D m Fmn = 0,\nwith Fmn = \u2202m An \u2212\u2202n Am and D m the covariant derivative in the AdS5 background. (Am (x\u03bc , u)\nis the non\u2013normalizable solution to this equation corresponding to the boundary condition\nA\u03bc (x\u03bc , u \u2192 \u221e) = n\u03bc eiq*x .) For u smaller than\nuc \u2261 QR2 ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nthe Bessel functions decays exponentially, meaning that a 'photon' with large Q2 cannot penetrate deeply inside the bulk: the larger Q2 is, the closer the photon remains near the boundary.\nSince, on the other hand, the inverse power of u manifest in Eq. (3.5) favors small values of u,\nit is clear that the integral there is controlled by u \u223c uc .\nRemarkably, the R-boson wavefunction involves the same Bessel functions as the wavefunction describing the q q\u0304 excitation of a virtual photon in pQCD (cf. Eq. (2.4)). This suggests a\nkind of 'duality' between the dipole size r in pQCD and the 5th dimension u in AdS5 , via the\ncorrespondence r \u2194 R2 /u. We shall identify further aspects of this correspondence later on.\n(ii) The dilaton wavefunction \u03a6(u) is peaked around u \u223c u0 and decays at large u like\n\u03a6 \u223c u\u2212\u2206 , where \u2206 is the conformal dimension of the operator which creates this state. For\nglueballs corresponding to supergravity modes, \u2206 is a number of O(1) which is strictly larger\nthan 2. In the formal analogy to pQCD, the probability density |\u03a6(u)|2 \u223c u\u22122\u2206 corresponds to\nthe density n(r) of dipoles inside the onium, cf. Eq. (2.6). Note that the overlap between the\nR-boson and the dilaton wavefunction scales like u\u22122\u2206\n\u223c (1/Q2 )\u2206 , and hence it rapidly dies\nc\n2\naway when increasing Q .\n(iii) The last comment shows that DIS would be strongly suppressed at large Q2 if there\n\u2032\nwas not for the non\u2013locality hidden in the middle factor, (1/x)1+(\u03b1 /2)\u22062 , which describes the\nimaginary part associated with one string exchange in the curved, AdS5 , space. In less formal\nnotations, the action of this operator can be written as (with \u03c4 \u2261 ln(1/x))\n\u0012 \u00131+ \u03b1\u2032 \u22062\nZ\n2\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c4 \u22062\n1\n1\n\u2020\n\u03a6 \u03a6(u) \u2261\ndu\u2032 hu|e 2 |u\u2032 i |\u03a6(u\u2032 )|2 .\nx\nx\n\n(3.7)\n\nNotice the dominant energy behavior F2 (x) \u223c 1/x at small x: this is the hallmark of the graviton\nexchange in the t\u2013channel. (At high energy, the exchanged string is dominated by its graviton\ncomponent; see Sect. 4.2.) Furthermore, the operator \u22062 in the exponent is the Laplacian\ndescribing diffusion in the 5th dimension, for the spin\u20132 exchanged graviton. This operator\nappears because of the finite momentum transfer in the u\u2013direction, although the momentum\ntransfer in the physical four dimensions is strictly zero [15, 16]. Explicitly, this operator reads\n\u22062 \u2261\n\n\u0010 u \u00112\nR\n\n\u220720\n\n\u0010 u \u0011\u22122\nR\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n=\n\n4 2\n(\u2202 \u2212 1)\nR2 \u03c1\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fwhere \u220720 is the scalar Laplacian on AdS5 and we have defined \u03c1 \u2261 ln(u2 /u20 ). By also using the\nintegral representation of the 'heat kernel' exp{\u2202\u03c12 }, one arrives at the following representation\nfor the expression in Eq. (3.7) :\nZ\nZ\nd\u03bd i\u03bd(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 ) \u03c4 \u2212 \u221a2\u03c4 (\u03bd 2 +1)\n\u2032\n2\n\u03bb\ne\u03c4 +2\u03b1 \u03c4 (\u2202\u03c1 \u22121) \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6(\u03c1) =\nd\u03c1\u2032\n|\u03a6(\u03c1\u2032 )|2\ne\ne\n2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n\u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 )2\ne\u03c90 \u03c4\n\u2032\n= \u221a\nd\u03c1\u2032 e 4D\u03c4 e\u2212\u2206\u03c1 ,\n(3.9)\n2 \u03c0D\u03c4 0\n\u221a\nwhere we have used R2 /\u03b1\u2032 = \u03bb and introduced\n2\n\u03c90 \u2261 1 \u2212 \u221a ,\n\u03bb\n\nand\n\n2\nD\u2261\u221a .\n\u03bb\n\n(3.10)\n\n\u221a\nEq. (3.9) result shows a Pomeron\u2013like increase with \u03c4 , with an intercept 1 + \u03c90 = 2 \u2212 2/ \u03bb\nwhich is slightly shifted from 2 due to the curvature of AdS5 [14, 15, 16].\nOne should notice the formal similarity between the stringy 'Pomeron' amplitude in Eq. (3.9)\nand the cross\u2013section (2.15) which describes the BFKL Pomeron in pQCD. In this analogy, the\nfifth coordinate u plays, once again, the role of the inverse dipole size 1/r. Like for the BFKL\nPomeron, the non\u2013locality associated with the single Pomeron exchange in AdS5 is diffusive in\n\u03c1 \u223c ln u2 , with the rapidity \u03c4 playing the role of the evolution 'time'; accordingly, its effect\nbecomes important only for very high energies, exponentially large in the relevant coupling.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nNamely, the diffusive radius D\u03c4 in Eq. (3.9) becomes of O(1) when \u03c4 \u223c \u03bb, or 1/x \u223c e \u03bb . For\ncomparison, the corresponding estimate in pQCD reads \u03c4 \u223c 1/\u1fb1s , or 1/x \u223c e1/\u1fb1s , which at a\nfirst sight may look as an astronomically high energy, but in fact is is not: \u1fb1s is not that small\nin real world (\u1fb1s = 0.2 \u00f7 0.4 for the high\u2013energy experiments), and rapidities of order 1/\u1fb1s or\neven larger are within the reach of the present\u2013day accelerators.\nUp to an overall factor of O(1/Nc2 ) that we shall shortly comment on, Eq. (3.9) can be\nviewed as the string theory analog of the dipole\u2013onium scattering amplitude in pQCD, in the\nBFKL approximation. The dipole (a q q\u0304 excitation of the virtual photon with a given transverse\nsize r) is now replaced by the R-boson Am (u) (the metric fluctuation induced by the R-current\nat a given position u along the 5th dimension), and the dilaton plays the same role as the onium\n- the corresponding wavefunctions are localized near the respective 'infrared' cutoff (u \u223c u0\nfor the dilaton and, respectively, r \u223c R0 for the onium) and they exhibit power\u2013law tails with\nexponent \u2206 in the 'ultraviolet' (large u and, respectively, small r). At this stage, it would be\nstraightforward to repeat the analysis in Sect. 2 (mutatis mutandis) and thus determine the\nsaturation momentum for the dilaton. However, before doing that, it is necessary to better\nunderstand the validity limits of the approximation in Eq. (3.9). We shall do that in Sect. 3.2,\nwhere we shall discover that, in the string theory context, Eq. (3.9) is less general than its analog\nin pQCD - it holds only within a limited range of values for \u03c4 and \u03c1. These limitations have\nnot been properly recognized in the previous literature.\nWe conclude this subsection with a discussion of the interplay between the large\u2013Nc limit and\nthe high\u2013energy limit, which turns out to be quite subtle, for both weak and strong coupling. The\ntree\u2013level string amplitude (corresponding to single Pomeron exchange) is of order gs2 \u221d 1/Nc2 .\nIn Eq. (3.5) this factor 1/Nc2 has been canceled by a factor Nc2 implicit in the R-current. (The\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\flatter receives contributions from all the fields in the N = 4 SYM theory which are charged\nunder the R-symmetry; these fields are scalars and Weyl fermions in the adjoint representation\nof the colour group, hence they have Nc2 \u2212 1 \u2248 Nc2 degrees of freedom.)\nThis is similar to what happens in QCD at weak coupling: the BFKL result (2.10) involves\nan overall factor \u03b12s \u223c \u1fb12s /Nc2 which is partially canceled in F2 by a factor Nc coming from\nthe photon wavefunction, Eq. (2.4). Yet, the unitarity corrections apply directly to the dipole\u2013\ndipole scattering (and not only to F2 ), hence they become important when the small factor 1/Nc2\nmanifest in Eqs. (2.10) or (2.15) gets compensated by the energy evolution. As discussed below\nEq. (2.15), for the BFKL Pomeron this happens at a critical rapidity \u03c4cr \u223c (1/\u1fb1s ) ln(Nc2 /\u1fb12s ).\nFor \u03c4 >\n\u223c \u03c4cr , multiple Pomeron exchanges become important and ensure unitarization.\nReturning to strong coupling and the dual string theory, there the multiple Pomeron exchanges correspond to higher genus string amplitudes which are suppressed by powers of 1/Nc2 .\nHence, unitarity corrections become important at \u03c4cr \u223c ln Nc2 . We thus see that, in the strict\nlarge\u2013Nc limit (Nc \u2192 \u221e at fixed energy), there is no issue of unitarity: higher loop amplitudes, being proportional to inverse powers of 1/Nc2 , can be made arbitrarily small even at very\nhigh energy. On the other hand, when Nc is large but finite, the single Pomeron exchange\nhas only a limited applicability, and beyond that one has to sum over an infinite number of\nmulti\u2013loop diagrams corresponding to arbitrarily many Pomerons exchanged in the t\u2013channel.\nWhat is however different from the situation at weak coupling is that, for generic values of \u03c4\nand \u03c1 \u223c ln Q2 , the amplitude in the vicinity of the unitarity line is not dominated by the single\nPomeron exchange anymore. This is why, in general, the saturation line cannot be inferred from\nthe previous formulae in this section, but requires some further analysis.\nIt will be our goal in what follows to determine the onset of the various types of unitarity\ncorrections in the parameter space of \u03c4 and \u03c1. To have\naccess to the full structure of the high\u2013\n\u221a\nenergy 'phase diagram', we shall assume that Nc2 > e \u03bb - so that diffusion effects (which, we\n\u221a\nrecall, require a\u221a rapidity evolution \u03c4 >\n\u223c \u03bb) become important before unitarization. But the\nopposite case e \u03bb \u226a Nc2 will be included too in our results, as a special limit.\n3.2 Limit of the single Pomeron approximation : A lesson from a sum rule\nThe fundamental difference between the physics of unitarization at weak and, respectively, strong\ncoupling comes from the fact that, in the strongly\u2013coupled gauge theories with a gravity dual,\nthe high\u2013energy scattering amplitude is predominantly real (it starts as one graviton exchange),\nwhile at weak coupling it is predominantly imaginary (in both QCD and N = 4 SYM theory).\nOf course, the large real part at strong coupling is irrelevant for the total cross section so long\nas the latter is computed at tree\u2013level. But at higher loop level, say, starting with two\u2013graviton\nexchange, this gives rise to an imaginary part via diffractive processes - i.e., processes where\nthe final states (string excitations or higher Kaluza\u2013Klein modes) are separated by a rapidity\ngap. On the other hand, the imaginary part of the tree\u2013level amplitude (3.5) is associated\nwith the inelastic production of excited string states, with no rapidity gap2 . It turns out that,\nwhen \u03c1 \u223c ln Q2 is larger than a certain critical value, the diffractive processes dominate over\n2\n\nStrictly speaking, the DIS process is always inelastic, since the virtual photon cannot appear in the final\nstate. Here, we use the word 'inelastic' to suggestively distinguish the final states without rapidity gap from the\ndiffractive ones, which exhibit such a gap.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fthe inelastic ones in the approach towards unitarity. We shall discuss this issue in detail in\nthe next section, but for the time being let us proceed naively and study the onset of unitarity\ncorrections on the basis of the tree\u2013level results in the previous subsection, which include the\ninelastic processes alone. This will drive us into a paradox which will point out towards the\nnecessity to include the additional, diffractive, contributions.\nAfter also including the essential factor 1/Nc2 , the forward scattering amplitude (3.9) for\nthe R-boson\u2013dilaton can be more suggestively rewritten as (compare to Eq. (2.5))\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c1\u2032 T0 (\u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 , \u03c4 ) |\u03a6(\u03c1\u2032 )|2\n(3.11)\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) =\n0\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c1\u2032\n\nwhere |\u03a6(\u03c1\u2032 )|2 = e\n\nand\nT0 (\u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u2261\n\n\u2032 )2\n1\ne\u03c90 \u03c4\n\u2212 (\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\n4D\u03c4\n\u221a\ne\nNc2 2 \u03c0D\u03c4\n\n(3.12)\n\nrepresents the elementary scattering amplitude between states localized around \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 in the\nsingle-Pomeron-exchange approximation (the analog of the dipole\u2013dipole amplitude in Sect. 2).\nThe unitarity bound on this elementary amplitude determines the saturation line for a dilaton\nstate localized at \u03c1\u2032 ; namely, the condition T0 (\u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u223c 1 for \u03c1 = \u03c1s (\u03c4, \u03c1\u2032 ) implies\np\n\u03c1s (\u03c4, \u03c1\u2032 ) = \u03c1\u2032 + \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ),\n\u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ) \u2261 4D\u03c4 (\u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212 ln Nc2 ) ,\n(3.13)\n\nwhere \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ) refers to a dilaton state localized at u \u223c u0 . (As in Sect. 2, we neglect the effects\n\u221a\nof the slowly varying prefactor 1/(2 \u03c0D\u03c4 ) in Eq. (3.12).)\nEq. (3.13) applies for \u03c4 > \u03c4cr = (1/\u03c90 ) ln Nc2 and should be compared to the corresponding\nresult, Eq. (2.23), in pQCD: the similarity between these two results would become even closer\nif it was possible to extrapolate Eq. (3.13) to large rapidities \u03c4 \u226b \u03c4cr , where ln Nc2 could be\nexpanded out from the square root. However, as we shall later discover, such an extrapolation\nwould be incorrect: in reality, Eq. (3.13) applies only within a limited range in \u03c4 above \u03c4cr ,\n\u221a\nnamely, within the window \u03c4cr < \u03c4 < \u03c4c , with \u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4cr \u2243 2 ln Nc2 / \u03bb (see Eq. (3.28) below).\nThis limitation is in turn related to a failure of our formula (3.12) for the elementary\namplitude, which becomes incomplete at high energies and for large values of \u03c1. To illustrate\nthis failure, we shall show that Eq. (3.12) leads to an unphysical result when used to evaluate\nthe following moment of the structure function\nZ \u221e\nZ 1\n2\n2\nd\u03c4 e\u2212\u03c4 F2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) .\n(3.14)\ndx F2 (x, Q ) =\nM (Q ) \u2261\n0\n\n0\n\nBy energy\u2013momentum conservation, this moment should be independent of Q2 ; however, as\nwe shall demonstrate in what follows, the (properly unitarized) amplitude for single Pomeron\nexchange, Eq. (3.12), fails to saturate the sum\u2013rule at large values of Q2 .\nWithin the present approximations, the structure function F2 of the dilaton is given by\nEq. (3.5). To avoid unnecessary complications with the R-boson wavefunction, we shall here\nrestrict ourselves to the structure function that would be measured by a single R-boson state\nlocalized at u (the analog of a single dipole projectile with fixed size r in pQCD). The coordinate\nu fixes the resolution scale, u2 \u221d Q2 (cf. Eq. (3.6)), hence F2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) can be evaluated as\nF2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) \u223c Nc2 e\u03c1 T (\u03c1, \u03c4 )\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n(3.15)\n\n\f(up to an irrelevant prefactor), with \u03c1 \u2261 ln(u2 /u20 ). The factor of Nc2 accounts for the color\ndegrees of freedom of the fields contributing to the R-current and e\u03c1 accounts for the factor Q2\nin the relation (2.2) between F2 and the 'dipole' (here, R-boson) cross\u2013section.\nWe start by evaluating T (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) in the single-Pomeron approximation. This is given by\nEq. (3.11) with the elementary amplitude from Eq. (3.12) corrected for unitarity violations.\nThat is, for \u03c4 > \u03c4cr , we shall write (compare to Eq. (2.24) in pQCD)\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\nZ s0\n0\n\n(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 )2\n1\n\u2032\nd\u03c1 2 e\u03c90 \u03c4 e\u2212 4D\u03c4 e\u2212\u2206\u03c1 +\nNc\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c1\u2032 e\u2212\u2206\u03c1 .\n\n(3.16)\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0\n\nAs in Sect. 2, this representation is valid only in the regime where the amplitude is weak,\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u226a 1, but it can be used to approach the unitarity limit T \u223c 1, and thus compute the\ndilaton saturation momentum. The first integral in the r.h.s. of Eq. (3.16) involves the dilaton\ncomponents living at relatively small values of u, which scatter only weakly off the incoming\nR-boson. The second integral refers to the components at larger values of u, which undergo\nstrong scattering, but are exponentially suppressed by the dilaton wavefunction. (Of course,\nwhen \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4cr only the first integral would be present.) Accordingly, the overall amplitude is\ndominated by the components living near the infrared cutoff, so like in pQCD.\nIndeed, the integrand in the first integral is peaked at \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1 \u2212 2\u2206D\u03c4 ; hence, for \u03c1 < 2\u2206D\u03c4 ,\nthat integral is dominated by its lower limit \u03c1\u2032 = 0, which yields\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n\n1 \u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c12\n1 \u2212\u2206(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 )\ne\ne 4D\u03c4 +\ne\n.\nNc2\n\u2206\n\n(3.17)\n\nThis amplitude becomes of O(1) when \u03c1 \u2243 \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ), meaning that the saturation momentum of\nthe dilaton coincides with that of its component located at u \u2243 u0 : \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) = \u03c1s0 (\u03c4 ). However,\nthe above calculation of \u03c1s is consistent only so long as \u03c1s < 2\u2206D\u03c4 , meaning \u03c1s0 < 2\u2206D\u03c4 ,\nwhich in turn requires \u03c4 < \u03c4d , with\n\u03c4d \u2261\n\nln Nc2\nln Nc2\n\u221a\n.\n=\n\u03c90 \u2212 D\u22062\n1 \u2212 (2/ \u03bb)(\u22062 + 1)\n\n(3.18)\n\nWhen \u03c4 < \u03c4d , one can check that the second term in Eq. (3.17) is exponentially suppressed next\nto the first one, and therefore\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\n1 \u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c12\ne\ne 4D\u03c4\nNc2\n\nwhen \u03c4 < \u03c4d\n\nand \u03c1 < 2\u2206D\u03c4 .\n\n(3.19)\n\nThus, in this regime, the scattering is controlled by the component of the dilaton living near\nthe IR cutoff u0 = \u039bR2 , in full analogy to what happens in pQCD (recall the discussion after\nEq. (2.26)). In particular, within the restricted interval \u03c4cr < \u03c4 < \u03c4d , Eq. (3.19) can be rewritten\nin a form which resembles the expansion of the QCD amplitude near the saturation line (compare\nto Eq. (2.27))\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243 e\u2212(1\u2212\u03b3)(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s ) e\u2212\n\n(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s )2\n4D\u03c4\n\nwhen \u03c4cr < \u03c4 < \u03c4d\n\nand \u03c1s < \u03c1 < 2\u2206D\u03c4 ,\n(3.20)\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fwith the 'anomalous dimension' \u03b3(\u03c4 ) given by\n\u03c1s0 (\u03c4 )\n1 \u2212 \u03b3(\u03c4 ) =\n=\n2D\u03c4\n\nr\n\n\u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212 ln Nc2\n.\nD\u03c4\n\n(3.21)\n\nNote however that, even for \u03c1 close to \u03c1s , where the diffusion term can be ignored in Eq. (3.20),\nthis amplitude does not show geometric scaling (unlike in pQCD), because the \u03c4 \u2013dependence of\nthe 'anomalous dimension' (3.21) cannot be neglected within the corresponding validity range.\nThis difference can be understood as follows: in pQCD, expressions like Eq. (2.27) are valid\nup to arbitrarily large values of \u03c4 , much larger than the critical value \u03c4cr \u223c (1/\u1fb1s ) ln(1/\u03b12s ) for\nthe onset of saturation; then properties like geometric scaling emerge via asymptotic expansions\nvalid at \u03c4 \u226b \u03c4cr . By contrast, in the present context, Eq. (3.20) is valid only within a limited\nrange of values for \u03c4 above \u03c4cr , where such asymptotic expansions are not possible anymore.\nThe case where \u03c1 > 2\u2206D\u03c4 can be similarly treated. For \u03c4 < \u03c4d , the saddle point \u03c1\u2032 =\n\u03c1 \u2212 2\u2206D\u03c4 lies within the integration range and gives the dominant contribution to the overall\namplitude:\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\n1 (\u03c90 +D\u22062 )\u03c4 \u2212\u2206\u03c1\ne\nNc2\n\nwhen \u03c4 < \u03c4d\n\nand \u03c1 > 2\u2206D\u03c4 ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nin agreement with a corresponding result in Ref. [15]. For \u03c4 > \u03c4d , Eq. (3.16) would predict\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u223c e\u2212\u2206(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0 ) , but this result cannot be trusted anymore since, as we shall shortly argue,\nEq. (3.16) is not a reliable approximation for such large values of \u03c1 and \u03c4 .\nTo see that, consider the prediction of Eq. (3.16) for the sum\u2013rule (3.14). When computing\nthe integral there, the amplitude (3.16) can be replaced by its simpler expression in Eq. (3.19)\n(this will be checked later). To also account for the unitarity bound, we shall write\n\uf8f1 1\n\u03c12\n\u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212 4D\u03c4\n\uf8f2\ne\ne\n2\nT (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243 Nc\n\uf8f3\n1\n\nfor \u03c4 < \u03c4s (\u03c1)\n\n(3.23)\n\nfor \u03c4 >\n\u223c \u03c4s (\u03c1) .\n\nHere, \u03c4s (\u03c1) is the dilaton saturation line expressed as a function of \u03c1 (the 'inverse' of the function\n\u03c1s (\u03c4 )); that is, \u03c4s (\u03c1) is the rapidity at which the unitarity corrections become important on the\nresolution scale fixed by \u03c1. Using Eq.

The corresponding integrand is strongly peaked near the saddle point at\n\u2217\n\n\u03c4 (\u03c1) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb\n\u03c1.\n4\n\n(3.27)\n\nNote that, for \u03c4 \u223c \u03c4 \u2217 , we have 2\u2206D\u03c4 \u223c \u2206\u03c1 > \u03c1, which justifies our use of the simplified\nexpression (3.19) for the single\u2013Pomeron amplitude in Eq. (3.16).\nSo long as \u03c4 \u2217 (\u03c1) < \u03c4s (\u03c1), this saddle point lies inside the integration domain and can be\nused to estimate the integral. The ensuing result for M1 (\u03c1) is independent of \u03c1, showing that the\nsum\u2013rule is saturated by the single\u2013Pomeron exchange, as it should for this to be a consistent\napproximation. This is the situation considered in Ref. [15], within the framework of the strict\nlarge\u2013Nc limit. Note, however, that in that limit, the saturation rapidity \u03c4s was effectively\npushed up to infinity and unitarity has never been an issue3 .\nHowever, when Nc is kept finite (although large), unitarity is an issue, which modifies, in\nparticular, the previous calculation of M1 (\u03c1) at large values of \u03c1. Namely, the function \u03c4 \u2217 (\u03c1)\ngrows faster than \u03c4s (\u03c1), so the two curves cross each other at a point (see also Fig. 3)\n(\u03c4c , \u03c1c ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n4 ln Nc2\nln Nc2\n\u221a ,\u221a\n1 \u2212 4/ \u03bb\n\u03bb\u22124\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.28)\n\nHence, when \u03c1 > \u03c1c , the saddle point (3.27) lies outside the integration range. Then, the integral\ngiving M1 is dominated by its upper cutoff at \u03c4 = \u03c4s (\u03c1), which however yields only a tiny result,\nof the same order as M2 (since for \u03c4 \u223c \u03c4s (\u03c1), the amplitude (3.23) is O(1)).\nThus, for \u03c1 > \u03c1c the sum\u2013rule is not saturated by the single Pomeron exchange anymore,\nmeaning that some new physical mechanism, which was missed by this approximation, should\nbecome important in this region. The above calculation gives us some indications in that respect:\nWe have already noticed that, when increasing \u03c1 towards \u03c1c , the saddle point (3.27) approaches\nthe saturation line (3.24), that it crosses exactly at \u03c1 = \u03c1c . It is then reasonable to assume\nthat, for \u03c1 > \u03c1c , the saddle point should remain along the saturation line: \u03c4 \u2217 (\u03c1) = \u03c4s (\u03c1). (One\ncannot have \u03c4 \u2217 (\u03c1) > \u03c4s (\u03c1), since the integral over \u03c4 in the saturation region is always dominated\nby its lower limit \u03c4s (\u03c1), as manifest on Eq. (3.25).) If so, then the sum\u2013rule at large \u03c1 can\nbe estimated as in Eq. (3.26): M (\u03c1) \u223c Nc2 exp{\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c4s (\u03c1)}. This estimate, together with the\ncondition M (\u03c1) = O(1), allows us to predict the form of the saturation line at large \u03c1 > \u03c1c :\n\u03c4s (\u03c1) \u2243 \u03c1 + ln Nc2 ,\n\nor\n\n\u03c1s (\u03c4 ) \u2243 \u03c4 \u2212 ln Nc2 .\n\n(3.29)\n\nThis discussion suggests that the complete saturation line should actually involve two branches,\ngiven by Eq. (3.24) for \u03c1 < \u03c1c and, respectively, Eq. (3.29) for \u03c1 > \u03c1c . Remarkably, these two\nbranches appear to continuously match with each other at the transition point (3.28) : both\ntheir values and their first derivatives coincide at this point (see Fig. 3).\nWhat should be the unitarization mechanism responsible for the saturation line in Eq. (3.29) ?\nOnce again, the previous sum\u2013rule calculation gives us an indication in that sense: Along the\n3\n\nThis is also the situation in pQCD, where the sum\u2013rule (3.14) is dominated by relatively large values of\nx \u223c O(1), hence its calculation is insensitive to unitarity corrections, or even to the BFKL evolution.\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fline which controls the sum\u2013rule, the energy dependence of the R-boson\u2013dilaton amplitude is\nprecisely that of the massless graviton (not Pomeron) exchange:\n\u2212\u03c12\n\n\u221a\n\ne\u03c90 \u03c4 e 4D\u03c4 = e(1\u22124/\n\n\u03bb)\u03c4\n\n= e\u03c4 e\u2212\u03c1 .\n\n(3.30)\n\n\u221a\n(We have repeatedly used \u03c4 = ( \u03bb/4)\u03c1, cf. Eq. (3.27).) Eq. (3.30) is indeed the same as the\npropagator of a massless graviton. This result is quite suggestive : The shift of the Pomeron\nintercept 1 \u2192 \u03c90 in Eq. (3.9) can be understood as a result of gravitons acquiring a mass due\nto the curvature of AdS5 (see Sect. 4.2 below for details). However, along the line Eq. (3.27),\nand in fact in the whole region on the right of this line as we shall see, the presence of massless\ngravitons is inevitable. The graviton exchange is dominantly real and much more non\u2013local than\nthe Pomeron exchange, which is non\u2013local only due to diffusion. However, double, or multiple,\ngraviton exchanges can generate imaginary parts, via the diffractive final states alluded to at\nthe beginning of this subsection. As we shall explicitly see later on, such multiple exchanges are\nindeed responsible for unitarization at \u03c1 > \u03c1c and they produce the saturation line in Eq. (3.29).\n\n4. Mapping the high\u2013energy 'phase diagram'\nMotivated by the above considerations, in this section we shall study the Pomeron propagator\nin the AdS5 geometry, with due attention to both its real and its imaginary part. This will allow\nus to follow the transition between a genuine Pomeron behaviour at relatively low values of \u03c1,\nwhere the curvature effects are important and give rise to an imaginary part and to diffusion,\nand a massless graviton propagator at large \u03c1, which is long\u2013ranged and predominantly real.\nThen we shall explain how multiple graviton exchanges generate an imaginary part via diffractive\nprocesses, and compute the corresponding saturation line. As a preliminary, we shall make some\ncomments on the anomalous dimension of twist\u2013two operators at strong coupling, which justify\nthe use of the 'diffusion approximation' in the approach towards the saturation line.\n4.1 Anomalous dimension of twist\u2013two operators in N = 4 SYM\nThe variable \u03b3 introduced in Sect. 2 has the interpretation as the anomalous dimension of the\ntwist\u2013two, spin\u2013j gluonic operator\nTr[F\u03bc+ (D + )j\u22122 F +\u03bc ],\n\n(4.1)\n\nwith j analytically continued to non\u2013integer values. (In the BFKL context one has j = 1 + \u03c7(\u03b3);\nsee [37] for discussions on the anomalous dimension and the operator product expansion in that\nframework.) Recall that the total dimension \u2206(j) of the operator Eq. (4.1) is given by4\n\u2206(j) = j + 2 \u2212 2\u03b3(j) .\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn the weak coupling expansion, \u03b3 \u223c O(\u03b1s ), while the BFKL resummation gives a number of\nO(1) (and comprised between 0 and 1/2; cf. Sect. 2). On the other hand, for N = 4 SYM at\n4\n\nThis is the common definition of \u03b3 in the small\u2013x literature, which differs by a factor \u22122 from the one which\nis most often used in the literature. A yet different convention \u03b3 \u2192 1 \u2212 \u03b3 is sometimes used.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fstrong 't Hooft coupling \u03bb = g2 Nc \u226b 1, the AdS/CFT correspondence predicts that the twist\u2013\ntwo operators with j 6= 2 receive a large, negative (in our conventions), anomalous dimension.\nSpecifically, Ref. [39] has found\n\u221a\nj\n\u03bb\n\u03b3(j) \u2248 \u2212\nln \u221a ,\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\nfor j \u226b\n\n\u221a\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u03bb and, respectively,\n\u03b3(j) \u2248 \u2212\n\nr\n\nj 1\n\u03bb4 ,\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\n\u221a\nfor 1 \u226a j \u226a \u03bb. These results were obtained by computing the energy and the angular\n\u221a\nmomentum of a 'folded' closed string state rotating in the AdS5 space. When j \u226a \u03bb, the string\n\u221a\nis spinning in a small region compared with the radius R, while the case j \u226b \u03bb corresponds\nto a macroscopic string stretched over a distance larger than R.\nBecause of the large anomalous dimension for twist\u2013two operators (excepting the energy\nmomentum tensor which has zero anomalous dimension \u03b3(2) = 0), it has been argued in [15]\nthat the OPE in DIS at strong coupling must be considerably reorganized. The dominant\ncontribution comes from the 'protected' (i.e., non\u2013renormalized), double\u2013trace, operators which\ncreate and annihilate the entire hadron of interest. These operators are nominally higher\u2013twist,\nbut since their dimension is of order unity, their contribution is less suppressed compared to the\ntwist\u2013two operators having |\u03b3(j)| \u226b 1 for generic j 6= 2. Hence DIS at moderate values of x\ncan be pictured as a process where a virtual photon knocks off an entire charged hadron \u2013 a\ndrastically different picture from pQCD where a photon knocks off partons inside the hadron.\nWhile plausible in the Bjorken limit (Q2 \u2192 \u221e at fixed \u03c4 ), this is no longer the case in the\nRegge limit (\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e at fixed Q2 ). The important regime at high energy is j \u223c 2. Since \u03b3(2) = 0\nexactly, \u03b3(j) remains small in the vicinity of j = 2, and the twist\u2013two operators (analytically\ncontinued to complex values of j near j = 2) should still give the leading contribution. Notably,\nRefs. [38] and [16] arrived at the same expression for \u03b3(j) in the 'diffusion approximation' from\nvery different arguments. It is obtained as the solution to\n1\n1\nj \u2212 j0 = \u221a (\u2206 \u2212 2)2 = \u221a (j \u2212 2\u03b3(j))2 ,\n2 \u03bb\n2 \u03bb\n\n(4.5)\n\n2\nj0 = 2 \u2212 \u221a = 1 + \u03c90 ,\n\u03bb\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere\n\nis the Pomeron intercept. Notice that the property \u03b3(2) = 0 is indeed verified by the solution\nto Eq. (4.5). Some light on the origin of Eq. (4.5) will be shed by the manipulations in the next\nsubsection. The inverse function j(\u03b3) is approximately quadratic in \u03b3 and has a minimum at\n1\n\u03b30 = 1 \u2212 \u221a ,\n\u03bb\nwith the minimum value j(\u03b30 ) = j0 .\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fIn general, the diffusion approximation is expected to be valid only in the vicinity of this\nminimum, i.e., when \u03b3 \u223c \u03b30 , j \u223c j0 . Away from j = 2, one could a priori expect significant\nnonlinear corrections to the right hand side of Eq. (4.5). This is precisely what happens at weak\ncoupling, in the context of the BFKL equation, where the diffusion approximation corresponding\nto \u03b30 = 1/2, cf. Eq. (2.14), significantly deviates from the exact BFKL characteristic function\nalready when \u03b3 = \u03b3s \u2243 0.37. (This is why, in that context, it would be incorrect to compute the\nsaturation line by 'unitarizing' the amplitude (2.15) obtained via the diffusion approximation).\nHowever, it turns out that at strong coupling the diffusion approximation is much more\nrobust and has a much wider validity range than at weak coupling. For instance, one can see that\nEq. (4.5) correctly reproduces the leading behavior, Eq. (4.4), for large (but not asymptotically\nlarge) j. (As a matter of fact, Ref. [38] has determined the proportionality constant in Eq. (4.5)\nin such a way to match Eq. (4.4). But the derivation of Ref. [16] does not rely on this matching.)\nMoreover, Eq. (4.5) coincides with the well\u2013known anomalous dimension formula of a scalar field\nin AdS5\np\n\u2206 = 2 + 4 + m2 R 2 ,\n(4.8)\nwhere m is the mass of the state lying on the leading Regge trajectory (i.e., the highest spin\nstate in a given excitation level n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) :\nm2 =\n\n2(j \u2212 2)\n4n\n=\n.\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis shows that, in this strong\u2013coupling context, the quadratic relation j \u223c \u03b3 2 ('diffusion\napproximation') has its roots in the Regge behavior of string excited states \u22062 \u223c m2 \u223c j, which\n\u221a\nis expected to hold in AdS5 for generic values of j up to j \u223c \u03bb (see Eq. (4.4)). This range is\nlarge enough to cover all values of j and \u03b3 of interest at high energy, as we shall later verify.\n4.2 The Pomeron propagator\nIn Eq. (3.5), the Virasoro\u2013Shapiro formula in flat space was used rather heuristically [15]. For\na more coherent discussion on both the real and the imaginary parts of the amplitude, it is\nimportant to carefully derive this amplitude from the fundamental S\u2013matrix in string theory,\nstarting with the operator representation of the latter in curved spacetime. Up to a factor gs2 to\nbe introduced in the final result, this representation reads [23, 16]\nZ\nZ\nD\nE\nd2 z V(\u221e)V(1)z L0 \u22122 z\u0304 L\u03030 \u22122 W(1)W(0)\nd2 z hV(\u221e)V(1)W(z)W(0)i \u2248\n|z|<1\n\n\u001c\n= V(\u221e)V(1)\n\n\u03b4L0 ,L \u03030\n\nL0 + L\u03030 \u2212 2\n\n\u001d\nW(1)W(0) .\n\n(4.10)\n\nHere, V 's and W 's are the vertex operators corresponding to dilatons and, respectively, gauge\nbosons in the (0, 0) picture, and the integration is over the string world\u2013sheet with spherical\ntopology. The average is understood in the sense of the string path integral, which involves an\nintegral over the zero modes and a path integral over the nonzero ones. Furthermore, L0 and\nL\u03030 are the right\u2013 and left\u2013moving Virasoro operators which generate the scale transformations\non the world\u2013sheet. The kernel \u03b4L0 ,L \u03030 /(L0 + L\u03030 \u2212 2) in the last expression can be recognized as\nthe propagator of the closed string exchanged in the t\u2013channel.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fOne can diagonalize the operators L0 and L\u03030 by inserting a complete set of string states -\nthe 'Pomeron states' -, which are the states exchanged in the t\u2013channel at high\u2013energy [16].\nTo that aim, one inserts the identity as a sum over the respective projection operators\nZ\nZ\nX Z d\u03bd\ndj 1 + e\u2212i\u03c0j\nd\u03bd\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n| Vj,\u2212\u03bd\nihVj,\u03bd\n| \u2212\u2192\n| Vj,\u2212\u03bd\nihVj,\u03bd\n|,\n(4.11)\n1=\n2\u03c0\n2i\nsin\n\u03c0j\n2\u03c0\nC\nj\n\nwhere the sum runs over all the positive, even, values of the spin : j = 2, 4, ..., corresponding to\nthe string states on the leading Regge trajectory in Eq. (4.9). Alternatively, the sum over j can\nbe realized as an integration in the complex j\u2013plane, as indicated in the r.h.s.; the contour C\nencircles the positive part of the real axis and is conveniently deformed into a contour L which\nruns parallel to the imaginary axis, on the left of all the poles at j > 0 (see Fig. 2 below). (More\nprecisely, this contour deformation within the Sommerfeld\u2013Watson representation is truly an\nanalytic continuation from the t\u2013channel amplitude related to the physical, s\u2013channel, amplitude\nvia crossing symmetry (t \u2194 s); see, e.g., [40].)\nIn the equation above, V \u00b1 is the 'Pomeron vertex operator' [16] which is dual to the twist\u2013\ntwo operator, Eq. (4.1), of the gauge theory (see also [41]). For large u, it takes the form\nj\n\n\u00b1\nVj,\u03bd\n\u223c U j\u22122\u22122i\u03bd (\u2202z X \u00b1 \u2202z\u0304 X \u00b1 ) 2 .\n\n(4.12)\n\nCapital letters denote world\u2013sheet fields, while lower case letters refer to their zero modes. Also,\n\u221a\nlight\u2013coordinates are defined in the standard way: X \u00b1 = (X 0 \u00b1 X 3 )/ 2, with the collision axis\ntaken along X 3 . For what follows it is useful to notice that the vertex operators associated with\nthe dilaton (V) and the R-boson (W) admit representations similar to that in Eq. (4.12), but\nwith the U -factor replaced by the corresponding wavefunction - \u03a8(U ) in the case of the dilaton\nand, respectively, Am (U ) for the R-boson.\nThe operator (4.12) has total dimension \u2206 = 2 + 2i\u03bd; together with Eq. (4.2), this implies\nthe following anomalous dimension :\n\u03b3=\n\nj\n\u2212 i\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhich appears to be different from the one usually associated with a leading\u2013twist operator\nin the diffusion approximation, cf. Eq. (2.13). Let us open here a parenthesis to explain this\ndiscrepancy: in the leading logarithmic approximation used throughout Sect. 2, the reference\nscale of the logarithm \u03c4 = ln s is ambiguous and usually taken to be a product of the two\nexternal scales. This ambiguity is resolved in the next\u2013to\u2013leading log approximation (NLLA)\nwhere \u03b3 is shifted in the following way [2]\n\u0012\n\ns\nQ\u039b\n\n\u0013j\u22121 \u0012\n\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\n\u0013 21 \u2212i\u03bd\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\ns\nQ2\n\n\u0013j\u22121 \u0012\n\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\n\u0013 2j \u2212i\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(4.14)\n\nto ensure that the Pomeron behaviour (s/Q2 )j\u22121 matches with the definition of the Bjorken\u2013x\nvariable in DIS (at high energy).\nThe action of L0 on the Pomeron vertex operator has been evaluated for j \u2248 2 [16] as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nj\n\u03b1\n\u03bd2 + 1\nj\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nVj,\u03bd\n,\n(4.15)\n\u2212 \u22062j Vj,\u03bd\n+ \u221a\nL0 Vj,\u03bd\n= L\u03030 Vj,\u03bd\n=\n=\n2\n4\n2\n\u03bb\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fwhere (c.f.

(4.13)\u2013(4.15) is\nrecognized as the previous condition (4.5). So, Eq. (4.5) simply states that V \u00b1 is a (1,1) tensor\non the world\u2013sheet in the curved background of AdS5 [42].\nWe are now prepared to evaluate the string amplitude in Eq. (4.10) in the semi\u2013classical\napproximation. After using Eqs.

Besides, the\npath integral over U reduces to the ordinary integral over u, with the appropriate, invariant,\nmeasure. Since the string propagator in Eq.

(4.23) exhibits 'radial factorization': it is expressed as a convolution in u of pieces which\ncan be recognized as wavefunctions for the R-boson and, respectively, the dilaton, and a kernel\nwhich is by construction the Pomeron propagator in string theory - a sum over all string states\nexchanged in the t\u2013channel at high energy -, and which after multiplication by gs2 plays the role\nof a scattering amplitude between states localized at u and u\u2032 . Clearly, this u\u2013factorization is\nthe string counterpart of the 'kT \u2013factorization' valid in the high\u2013energy regime at weak coupling\n(as exhibited, e.g., in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.5)).\nLet us concentrate on the elementary Pomeron amplitude, that we would like to compare\nto its previous approximation in Eq. (3.12). With our usual notation \u03c1 \u2261 ln(u2 /u20 ), this can be\nrewritten as\n\uf8f1\ns\u221a\n\uf8f6\uf8fc\n\uf8eb\nZ\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n\u2212i\u03c0j\n\u03c4\n(j\u22121)\ndj 1 + e\ne\n\u03bb\nj\u22122\n1\n\u221a\n\u2212\n(j \u2212 j0 )\uf8f8 ,\nexp (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ) \uf8ed\nTP (\u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 , \u03c4 ) = 2\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nNc L 2i sin \u03c0j\n2\n2\nj \u2212 j0\n(4.24)\n\nwhere we have used Eqs.

The contour L runs\nparallel to the imaginary j axis and crosses the real axis between the branch point at j = j0 \u2261\n\u221a\n2 \u2212 2/ \u03bb and the pole at j = 2 (see Fig. 2).\nFor sufficiently high energies, the integral can be evaluated by deforming the contour L \u2192 L\u2032 ,\nwith L\u2032 encircling the branch cut that ends at j0 , as shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, and more\nconveniently for our present purposes, one can use the saddle point method. Namely, the\nintegrand has a saddle point at\n\u221a\n\u03bb(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 )2\n\u2217\nj \u2243 j0 +\n,\n(4.25)\n8\u03c4 2\n\u221a\nwhere we have used \u03c4 \u226b \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 , as appropriate at high energy. So long as \u03bb(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 )/4 < \u03c4 , this\nsaddle point lies between j0 and 2, and then the use of the saddle point approximation is indeed\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 2: The analytic structure of the integrand in Eq.

By also using e\u2212i\u03c0j0 \u2248 1 + 2\u03c0i/ \u03bb, one thus finds that the high\u2013energy amplitude\ndevelops an imaginary part5 TP \u2261 Im T\u0303P , with\n\n1 \u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212(1\u2212\u03b30 )(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 ) \u2212 (\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 )2\ne\ne\ne 4D\u03c4 ,\n(4.26)\nNc2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c90 = 1 \u2212 2/ \u03bb, \u03b30 = 1 \u2212 1/ \u03bb, and D = 2/ \u03bb.\nEq. (4.26) coincides with the formula\npreviously used in Sect. 3, cf. Eqs. (3.9) or (3.12), up\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03bb\n1/\n. This additional factor has the same origin as the factor\nto a factor e\u2212(1\u2212\u03b30 )\u03c1 = u\u20322 /u2\n(r 2 /r \u20322 )1/2 in the BFKL case, Eq. (2.15) - namely, is reflects the high\u2013energy 'anomalous\ndimension' -, but it is less important here because the anomalous dimension \u03b30 is close to one\n(in contrast to the BFKL case where \u03b30 = 1/2). And indeed, by inspection of Eq. (4.26), one\ncan check that the additional term (1\u2212\u03b30 )(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ) in the exponent remains negligible so long as\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 \u226a \u03c4 , and hence it cannot affect our previous conclusions in Sect. 3.2. Note also that, in\nthis high\u2013energy approximation, the graviton pole \u223c 1/t is absent in the real part of the string\namplitude - in contrast to what happens in flat space -, because of the shift in the Pomeron\nintercept by the space\u2013time curvature: sin \u03c0j0 6= 0.\nHowever, the graviton pole reappears when moving to sufficiently large values of \u03c1 (for a\ngiven \u03c4 ), as we explain now. Indeed, when\n\u221a\n\u03bb\n(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ) > \u03c4 ,\n(4.27)\n4\nthe saddle point j \u2217 exceeds 2, and then one has to deform the contour from C to C \u2032 (see Fig.\n2), in order to separately evaluate the pole of (1/ sin \u03c0j) at j = 2. This leads to\nZ\ndj 1 + e\u2212i\u03c0j e(j\u22121)\u03c4 \u2212(1\u2212\u03b3(j))(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 )\n1\ne\u03c4 \u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 )\n\u2032\n\u221a\ne\n.\n(4.28)\n+ 2\nT\u0303P (\u03c1, \u03c1 , \u03c4 ) \u2248 2 e\nNc\nNc\n2i sin \u03c0j\nj \u2212 j0\nTP (\u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u2248\n\nC\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n5\n\nThe Virasoro\u2013Shapiro formula in flat space also gives an imaginary part in a similar manner. e\u2212i\u03c0\u03b1\n1/t \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 /2. This is how Eq. (3.5) was actually derived.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nt/2\n\n/t \u2248\n\n\fThe first, purely real, term \u221d e\u03c4 (u\u20322 /u2 ) is recognized as the propagator of the elementary,\nmassless, graviton in AdS5 . For large \u03c4 and \u03c1 (such that the condition (4.27) is satisfied),\nthis pole term dominates over the remaining contour integral. Indeed, the function f (j) \u2261\n(j \u2212 1)\u03c4 + \u03b3(j)(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ) obeys f (2) = \u03c4 , f \u2032 (j \u2217 ) = 0, and f \u2032 (j) < 0 for any real j within the interval\n2 \u2264 j < j \u2217 . Hence, whenever (4.27) is satisfied, one can choose the contour C \u2032 (see Fig. 2) to\ncross the real axis at some j1 with 2 < j1 < j \u2217 , and then Re f (j) < \u03c4 for any j along C \u2032 .\nThus for high energy and sufficiently large \u03c1, the 'Pomeron' exchange is dominated by the\nelementary graviton and the amplitude is predominantly real. Since the graviton propagator is\nvery non\u2013local in u, it can connect the large distance between u \u223c QR2 and u\u2032 \u223c \u039bR2 without\nmuch suppression. Accordingly, with increasing \u03c4 , the corresponding amplitude becomes of O(1)\nrelatively fast (much faster than for the diffusive Pomeron in Eq. (4.26) !), namely when\n\u03c4 = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 + ln Nc2 ,\n\n(4.29)\n\nin agreement with Eq. (3.29). Of course, being real, this single graviton exchange does not\ncontribute to F2 . Yet, multiple such exchanges can do so, as we shall shortly explain.\nTo summarize, the single\u2013Pomeron\u2013exchange approximation to F2 (x, Q2 ) is expected to be\n\u221a\na legitimate approximation at high energy and strong coupling so long as \u03c1 \u2261 ln Q2 /\u039b2 < 4\u03c4 / \u03bb\nand for rapidities \u03c4 < \u03c4s (\u03c1), with the saturation rapidity \u03c4s (\u03c1) given by Eq. (3.24). The two\ndelimitating curves intersect with each other at the point (\u03c1c , \u03c4c ), Eq. (3.28). This is also the\npoint where starts the large\u2013\u03c1 branch of the saturation line, cf. Eqs. (3.29) or (4.29), to be\nfurther discussed in the next subsection.\n4.3 Saturation line from multiple graviton exchanges\nThe previous analysis shows that the physics of unitarization in DIS at strong coupling and\nrelatively large Q2 is conceptually different from what happens either at weak coupling, or at\nstrong coupling but for lower values of Q2 . In the last two cases, which are the more standard\nones, the black disk limit for the scattering amplitude is approached by unitarizing the single\nPomeron exchange, which in turn requires energies which are high enough for the two scales\ninvolved in the collision to be joint by diffusion. But for strong coupling and large Q2 , the single\nPomeron exchange is unable to saturate the energy\u2013momentum sum rule (3.14)- essentially,\nbecause its imaginary part decays too fast at large Q2 . However, precisely in that large\u2013Q2\nregion, the full Pomeron propagator in string theory develops an additional, real, part, which\ndescribes elementary graviton exchanges and has the potential to generate stronger interactions,\nsince very non\u2013local in u. This new component can contribute to the DIS structure functions too,\nbut only via multiple scattering. In this subsection, we would like to argue (without performing\na fully fledged calculation of multiple scattering in AdS5 ) that multiple graviton exchanges\ndominate indeed at high energy and large Q2 (in the vicinity of the saturation line) and, in\nparticular, they saturate the sum rule in the way already suggested after Eq. (3.26).\nThe presence of a large real part in the Pomeron propagator describing the massless graviton\nexchange is a common feature in string theories, and hence also in gauge theories with a gravity\ndual. Multiple scattering in such theories is described by multi\u2013loop diagrams, and at each order\nof this loop expansion the dominant contribution is provided by the exchange of n gravitons\n(for a (n \u2212 1)\u2013loop amplitude). It is well\u2013known that in flat space such higher loop terms\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fexponentiate in the eikonal approximation [43, 12], and the same was recently shown to hold for\nhigh energy scattering in AdS5 [18, 17]. The eikonal approximation breaks down at very small\nimpact parameters and/or at extremely high energies (see below). In a string dual description\nof DIS at strong coupling, the impact parameter in the fifth dimension is large u/u\u2032 \u223c Q/\u039b, and\ntherefore the eikonal resummation is expected to work reasonably well.\nIn general, the exponentiation is done in the three\u2013dimensional impact parameter space\nspanned by the radial coordinate u and the two\u2013dimensional, physical, impact parameter ~b (neglecting nonlocality on S 5 ), whereas our previous formulae, like Eq. (4.24), are already integrated\nover ~b. While it is possible to undo this integral and analyze the three\u2013dimensional propagator following [18, 17], one may anticipate, following the example of QCD at weak coupling (cf.\nSect. 2; see also Ref. [44]), that a simplification occurs for relatively central impact parameters,\nb \u226a 1/\u039b. DIS is characterized by the large resolution scale Q2 \u226b \u039b2 which determines the size\nof the 'active' region in the transverse space. Hence, so long as b \u226a 1/\u039b one can neglect edge\neffects and work with scattering amplitudes averaged over b, so like Eq. (4.24).\nIn the present context, the eikonal approximation amounts to exponentiating the tree\u2013\nlevel 'Pomeron' amplitude Eq. (4.24), which thus becomes the phase shift in the S\u2013matrix:\n\u221a\nS = exp{iT\u0303P }. In the interesting domain at large \u03c1 \u2261 ln(Q2 /\u039b2 ), namely, \u03c1 > 4\u03c4 / \u03bb, the\nPomeron amplitude is given by Eq. (4.28) and has both real and imaginary parts.\nThe imaginary part describes 'inelastic processes' in which the final states are (generally\nmassive) string excitations, as obtained by cutting through the Pomeron. This imaginary part\ncan be evaluated in the saddle point approximation, with the result displayed in Eq. (4.26).\nBy itself, this contribution would generate the saturation line in Eqs. (3.13) or (3.29), which\nhowever has been argued to be inconsistent at large \u03c1 > \u03c1c , in Sect. 3.2.\nThe relevant contribution at large \u03c1 is rather the one generated by the real part of the phase\u2013\nshift, that is, by the exponentiation of the elementary graviton exchange. The corresponding\nimaginary part starts at the level of the two\u2013graviton exchange, where it describes, in particular,\nthe cross\u2013section for the elastic scattering between two states localized at u and u\u2032 , respectively.\nNote however that, in the context of DIS, this process is not truly elastic - rather, it is a\nparticularly simple diffractive process, which contributes to F2 -, because the incoming virtual\nphoton (or R-current) does not appear in the final state. The amplitude for such a double\ngraviton exchange is estimated as\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u03c4\ne \u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 ) 2\n\u2032\n,\n(4.30)\ne\nT2g (\u03c1, \u03c1 , \u03c4 ) \u2248\nNc2\nand becomes of O(1) along the saturation curve (4.29). More general diffractive processes -\ncharacterized by a rapidity gap between the products of the collision - are obtained by 'cutting'\nthe multiple scattering series in between successive graviton exchanges, and by allowing for more\ngeneral diffractive states: the strings in the final states need not be exactly the same as the\nincoming ones, rather they can be internal excitations of the latter, like higher Kaluza\u2013Klein\nmodes. Whenever this happens, the process is genuinely absorptive, already at the level of the\nelementary \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 amplitude.\nThe diffractive excitations of the string have been first discussed in Ref. [12] in flat space.\nLeaving a rigorous treatment of this effect in AdS5 for future work, here we only give an estimate\nof its magnitude. The internal excitation of incoming strings is due to the finiteness of the string\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fsize. This effect can be understood as the result of the tidal force [45] experienced by one of\nthe strings traversing a gravitational shock wave created by the other. In the operator eikonal\napproach of [12], the real part of the phase shift reads\n\u2032\n\ne\u03c4 U 2\ne\u03c4 u\u20322 1 \u2202 2\n\u2248\n+\nNc2 U 2\nNc2 u2\n2 \u2202u2\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u03c4 u\u20322\nNc2 u2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0168 \u0168 + * * * ,\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhere again capital letters denote operators, decomposed between zero and non\u2013zero modes as\nU = u + \u0168 . The non\u2013zero mode \u0168 is typically of the order the string size, as measured by a\nlocal inertial observer:\n\u0168 \u223c ls\n\nu\n,\nR\n\n(4.32)\n\n\u221a\nso the expansion parameter in Eq. (4.31) is ls2 /R2 = 1/ \u03bb. The strength of string excitations\nleading to absorption is measured by the second term of Eq. (4.31). It reaches unity when\n\u221a\n\u03c4 = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 + ln Nc2 + ln \u03bb ,\n(4.33)\nwhich, once again, is parametrically the same as Eq. (4.29). (Remember that we are in the\nregime where ln Nc2 > \u03bb \u226b ln \u03bb.) We thus see that all types of diffractive processes - both the\nquasi\u2013elastic ones, cf. Eq. (4.30), and the genuinely absorptive ones, cf. Eq. (4.31) - contribute\non equal grounds to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, and approach the\nunitarity limit along the curve exhibited in Eq. (4.29). This is in contrast to the flat space result\n[12] where the imaginary part due to string excitations is suppressed with respect to the real\npart by an inverse power of the impact parameter ls2 /b2 .\nSo far, the diffractive unitarity line (4.29) has been derived for the scattering between two\nstates localized at \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 . But it is easy to check that a similar line, with \u03c1\u2032 = 0, applies to\nthe dilaton as whole. Indeed, after performing the convolution with the dilaton wavefunction,\nthe relevant amplitude can be evaluated as in Eq. (3.16), which gives\nT2g (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\nZ s0\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c1\n\n0\n\n\u0014\n\ne\u03c4 \u2212(\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u2032 )\ne\nNc2\n\n\u00152\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c1\u2032\n\ne\n\n+\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c1\u2032 e\u2212\u2206\u03c1 ,\n\n(4.34)\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1s0\n\nwhere now \u03c1s0 \u2261 \u03c4 \u2212 ln Nc2 , cf. Eq. (4.29), and we have assumed that \u03c1 > \u03c1s0 . In writing\nthe equation above, we have focused on the two\u2013graviton exchange, cf. Eq. (4.30), since this\nis the dominant contribution when approaching the saturation lien from large values of \u03c1. At\nthis point, it is important to remember that the dilaton conformal dimension satisfies \u2206 > 2,\nas manifest on Eq. (4.8). Hence, the first integral in Eq. (4.34) is dominated by its lower limit\n\u03c1\u2032 = 0 and, moreover, the second integral is exponentially suppressed w.r.t. the first one. Thus,\nonce again, we find that the scattering is controlled by the dilaton component living near the\ninfrared cutoff at u \u223c u0 . This yields\nT2g (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n\n\u0014\n\ne\u03c4 \u2212\u03c1\ne\nNc2\n\n\u00152\n\n,\n\nwhich becomes of O(1) for \u03c1 \u2243 \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2212 ln Nc2 , in agreement with Eq. (3.29).\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n(4.35)\n\n\fFor \u03c1 > \u03c1c , with \u03c1c defined in Eq. (3.28), the curve (3.29) lies below the unitarity line\n(3.24) for inelastic processes (see also Fig. 3), meaning that, when increasing \u03c4 in this regime,\nthe unitarization of DIS proceeds via diffractive processes. Therefore, Eq. (3.29) represents the\nphysical saturation line for \u03c1 > \u03c1c . This conclusion is further corroborated by the following facts:\n(i) at \u03c1 = \u03c1c , the two branches of the saturation line, Eq. (3.24) and, respectively, Eq. (3.29),\ncontinuously match with each other, and (ii) for \u03c1 > \u03c1c , the energy\u2013momentum sum rule\n(3.14) is saturated by the diffractive processes (see below), showing that no important physical\nmechanism has been left out by the previous analysis.\nTo evaluate the sum\u2013rule (3.14), notice first that a contribution to F2 due to the exchange\nof n gravitons (with n \u2265 2), is parametrically\n\u0012\n\u0013n\n2\ne\u03c4\n2 Q\n2\n2 \u03c1\nF2 (\u03c4, Q ) \u223c Nc e Tng (\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u223c Nc 2\n.\n(4.36)\n\u039b\nNc2 (Q2 /\u039b2 )\nWhen this is inserted within the Eq. (3.14), it is clear that, for any n \u2265 2, the integrand is\nstrongly peaked at the saturation value \u03c4s = \u03c1 + ln Nc2 : indeed, the integrand rises exponentially\nwith \u03c4 so long as \u03c4 < \u03c4s , but it is exponentially decreasing at \u03c4 > \u03c4s . Moreover, at the peak\nvalue, Tng (\u03c1, \u03c4 = \u03c4s ) \u223c O(1), so the integral is evaluated as\nZ\nQ2\n(4.37)\nd\u03c4 e\u2212\u03c4 F2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) \u223c Nc2 2 e\u2212\u03c4s (\u03c1) \u223c O(1).\n\u039b\n\nThis result is independent of Q2 , as anticipated. Interestingly, the above calculation also shows\nthat, at high Q2 , most of the total energy (or longitudinal momentum) of the hadron lies along\nthe saturation line (3.29), that is, at relatively large rapidities, or small values of x. This is in\nsharp contrast with what happens in QCD at weak coupling, where the energy of a fast moving\nhadron is predominantly carried by the hadron constituents ('partons') with relatively large\nvalues of x, or small values of \u03c4 , well below the corresponding saturation value \u03c4s (\u03c1). We shall\nreturn to this observation in the final, discussion, section, where we shall attempt a partonic\ninterpretation for our results at strong coupling.\nWe conclude this section with some estimates for F2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) in the vicinity of the saturation\nline (3.29), to be compared to the corresponding results in pQCD, cf. Eqs. (2.30) and (2.31).\nNote first that Eq. (3.29) implies Q2s (\u03c4 ) = \u039b2 (e\u03c4 /Nc2 ).\n2\nFor relatively low virtualities, Q2 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), one finds\nF2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) \u223c\n\nNc2 Q2\n\u039b2\n\nwhen\n\n2\nQ2 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(4.38)\n\nwhich shows saturation, in the sense that F2 does not increases with \u03c4 , and that F2 /Q2 is not\ndivergent as Q2 \u2192 0. (A physical interpretation for this behaviour will be proposed in Sect. 5.)\nFor Q2 much larger than Q2s (\u03c4 ), the structure function is dominated by the two\u2013graviton\nexchange and scales as\n\u0012\n\u00132\nNc2 Q2 e\u03c4 \u039b2\n2\n,\n(4.39)\nF2 (\u03c4, Q ) \u223c\n\u039b2\nNc2 Q2\nor\n\u0012\n\u00132\nF2 (\u03c4, Q2 )\nNc2 Q2s (\u03c4 )\nwhen\nQ2 \u226b Q2s (\u03c4 ) .\n(4.40)\n\u223c\nQ2\n\u039b2\nQ2\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fThis is geometric scaling (compare to the weak\u2013coupling result in Eq. (2.30)), with an effective\nanomalous dimension \u03b3s = \u22121, which however is no longer associated with the anomalous\ndimension of the twist\u2013two operator. Indeed, the contribution exhibited in Eqs. (4.39) or (4.40)\nis obviously of higher twist order, and in fact this process has an analog in standard DIS: the\n'diffractive dissociation' of the virtual photon, \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 q q\u0304p, which involves the elastic scattering\nbetween the 'color dipole' (the q q\u0304 pair) and the proton (see, e.g., [26, 34, 49]). There are however\nsome interesting differences between these results and the corresponding ones at weak coupling:\n(i) In pQCD, the diffractive scattering represents only a tiny fraction of the total DIS cross\u2013\nsection, whereas in the present, strong\u2013coupling, case this has been found to be the dominant\ncomponent at high energy, which in particular is responsible for unitarization.\n(ii) The diffractive structure function F2D in pQCD at high energy (small x) and large Q2\nis formally a leading\u2013twist quantity, F2D /Q2 \u223c 1/Q2 , although the relevant dipole amplitude is,\nof course, of higher\u2013twist order. This is so since, in computing F2D , the convolution with the\nvirtual photon wavefunction, Eq. (2.4), is dominated by the relatively large q q\u0304 excitations having\nr \u226b 1/Q (the so\u2013called 'aligned\u2013jet configurations') [34, 49]. This does not happen, however,\nin the present context at strong coupling, where the convolution in Eq. (4.23) is controlled\nby u \u223c uc \u223c Q. Accordingly, the ensuing structure function is a higher\u2013twist quantity, cf.\nEq. (4.40), so like the elementary scattering amplitude in Eq. (4.30).\n\n5. Physical discussion: Towards a partonic picture at strong coupling\nLet us first summarize the main new results in this paper, before we propose a physical interpretation for them. (These results are also graphically summarized in Fig. 3.) By studying\ndeep inelastic scattering at strong 't Hooft coupling and high energy within the dual string\ntheory, we have inferred the position of the saturation line which separates the weak\u2013scattering\nregime from the strong\u2013scattering one in the kinematical plane \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1, with \u03c4 = ln(s/Q2 ) and\n\u03c1 = ln(Q2 /\u039b2 ). This line is in fact the juxtaposition of two curves, matching with each other\nat the point (\u03c1c , \u03c4c ) defined in Eq. (3.28), which correspond to the two different mechanisms\nresponsible for unitarization in different kinematical regions :\n\u221a\n\u2022 For \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1c \u2243 4 ln Nc2 / \u03bb, the scattering amplitude in the vicinity of the unitarity limit is\ncontrolled by a single Pomeron exchange; this amplitude becomes of O(1) on the saturation\nline given by Eqs. (3.13) or (3.24), i.e., when Q2 = Q2s (\u03c4 ), with the saturation momentum\n\u221a\n2\nfor\n\u03c4cr < \u03c4 < \u03c4c ,\n(5.1)\nQ2s (\u03c4 ) = \u039b2 e 4D\u03c4 (\u03c90 \u03c4 \u2212ln Nc )\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith \u03c90 = 1 \u2212 2/ \u03bb, D = 2/ \u03bb, and \u03c4cr \u2243 ln Nc2 is the critical rapidity for the onset of\nunitarity corrections.\n\u2022 For \u03c1 > \u03c1c , the dominant contribution to the DIS structure function before unitarization\ncomes from multiple exchanges of elementary gravitons; the reaches the unitarity limit on\nthe saturation line shown in Eq.

The\ncontinuous, thick, line represents the saturation line. The other boundaries are explained in the text.\n\nIn Fig. 3, the lower branch of the saturation line, Eq. (5.1), is also represented, as a dotted\nline, for \u03c4 > \u03c4c , where it indicates the 'unitarity limit' for inelastic processes, i.e., the line along\nwhich the contribution of the single\u2013Pomeron exchange to the DIS amplitude becomes of O(1).\nNote that the 'diffusion approximation' that was implicitly used in deriving the equation of this\nline in Sect. 3.2 is still valid6 for such large values of \u03c1 because, along this line, j <\n\u223c 3, with\nthe upper limit j = 3 corresponding to \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e. (This can be checked by using Eq. (4.25)\n\u221a\ntogether with the large\u2013\u03c1 version of Eq. (3.24), that is, \u03c4s (\u03c1) \u2243 (\u03bb1/4 \u03c1/ 2 + ln Nc2 )/2.) Below\nthat line and for \u03c1 > \u03c1c , the DIS cross\u2013section is dominated by the diffractive processes (whose\ncontribution becomes of O(1) already along the proper saturation curve, Eq. (5.2)), whereas\nabove that line, both diffractive and inelastic processes contribute on equal footing and together\ngive an amplitude T = 1. Also, below the saturation line (5.2), the DIS cross\u2013section for \u03c1 > \u03c1c is\npredominantly diffractive, of higher\u2013twist order, and it exhibits geometric scaling, cf. Eq. (4.40).\nThe upper corner of Fig. 3 denoted as 'strong gravity' will be discussed towards the end of this\nsection.\n6\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 4.1, the diffusion approximation is expected to be correct so long as j \u226a\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb.\n\n\f\u221a\n\nSo far we have assumed Nc2 > e \u03bb , to allow both regimes alluded\nto above to coexist with\n\u221a\neach other. But it should be clear that the opposite case Nc2 \u226a e \u03bb (with Nc \u226b 1, though) is\nincluded too in our results, as the special limit \u03c1c \u2192 0 : then, the first regime squeezes to zero,\nmeaning that there is not enough phase\u2013space for the genuine Pomeron behaviour to appear -\nthe amplitude reaches values of order one via multiple graviton exchanges already before the\ndiffusion becomes important.\nNote that the above results do not involve special properties of the dilaton target, like its\nmass or its conformal dimension \u2206. We therefore expect them to universally apply (at strong\ncoupling) to all hadrons which, like the dilaton, have a dual state localized near the infrared\ncutoff u0 = \u039bR2 in the radial dimension of AdS5 . The same universality applies to the form of the\nstructure function F2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) in the vicinity of the saturation line. In the weak\u2013scattering regime\nat Q2 \u226b Q2s (\u03c4 ), F2 shows a rapid rise with \u03c4 and a rapid decrease with Q2 , F2 \u221d (e2\u03c4 /Q2 ), cf.\nEq. (4.39), which is the hallmark of the double\u2013graviton exchange. Furthermore, at low momenta\n2\n2 2\n2\nQ2 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), one finds F2 \u223c Nc Q /\u039b , cf. Eq. (4.38), a structure which is an almost automatic\nconsequence of the definition (3.15) of F2 together with the black disk limit for the scattering\namplitude. But in QCD at weak coupling at least, this structure is also tantamount of parton\nsaturation, which makes it tempting to propose a similar interpretation in the strong\u2013coupling\ncase as well.\nLet us first briefly recall the situation in pQCD (see, e.g., the review papers [27] for more\ndetails): there, the structure function F2 (\u03c4, Q2 ) measured in DIS can be interpreted as the quark\ndistribution in the target, as measured in the special frame (the 'infinite momentum frame',\nor IMF) in which the target has a very large longitudinal momentum P \u226b M . The 'quark\ndistribution' is the number of quarks per unit rapidity which are localized in impact parameter\nspace within an area \u223c 1/Q2 fixed by the resolution of the virtual photon; alternatively - via\nthe uncertainty principle -, this is the number of quark excitations with transverse momenta\n2\nk\u22a5 <\n\u223c Q. Hence, by knowing F2 (\u03c4, Q ), one can estimate the quark occupation number as\nnq (\u03c4, k\u22a5 ) \u2261\n\ndF2\n1\ndNq\n\u2243\n,\nd\u03c4 d2 k\u22a5 d2 b\u22a5\nNc dQ2 \u03c0R02\n\n(5.3)\n\n2 , R is the radius of the hadron disk,\nwhere the derivative in the r.h.s. is evaluated at Q2 = k\u22a5\n0\nand the factor 1/Nc enters since we consider quarks of a given color. (Other numerical factors,\nlike the number of spin states, or the number of flavors, are not explicitly shown.) Then, by using\nthe estimates (2.30) and (2.31) for F2 , one can distinguish between two physical regimes: (i) a\n2 )1\u2212\u03b3s ,\ndilute regime at high momenta k\u22a5 \u226b Qs (\u03c4 ), where nq (\u03c4, k\u22a5 ) scales like7 nq \u223c (Q2s (\u03c4 )/k\u22a5\nand thus rises rapidly with \u03c4 due the BFKL evolution, and (ii) a saturation regime at momenta\nk\u22a5 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), where nq saturates at a value of order 1. This is quark saturation and, as explained\nin Sect. 2, it ultimately reflects the saturation of the gluon occupation numbers in pQCD at\nsmall x [19, 28, 29, 6, 9] : ng (\u03c4, k\u22a5 ) \u223c 1/\u1fb1s for k\u22a5 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ).\nReturning to the strong\u2013coupling problem of interest, it is clear that a straightforward partonic interpretation is now hindered by the lack of a simple relation between the operators which\nenter the structure of the R\u2013current (for the N = 4 SYM theory, this current receives contributions from the Weyl fermions and from the scalar fields) and the physical excitations in the\n7\n\n2\nFor very large k\u22a5\n, the anomalous dimension dies away, \u03b3s \u2192 0, and one recovers the expected bremsstrahlung\n2\nspectrum nq \u221d 1/k\u22a5 .\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\ftarget wavefunction: the latter would be created, or annihilated, by the respective fundamental\nfields only to lowest order in perturbation theory; but at strong coupling this relation could be\nstrongly renormalized, in a way which is not under control. It is not clear, though, whether\nsuch a renormalization will completely wash out the parton picture suggested by perturbation\ntheory. For instance, it is known that the entropy of strongly coupled N = 4 SYM theory at\nfinite temperature, which is a direct measure of the number of states, differs only by a factor\n3/4 from the entropy of the corresponding ideal gas, where all the states are associated with\nfree fundamental fields. This is suggestive that, at least, the counting of sates is quite similar\nat strong coupling and at weak coupling.\nA similar suggestion emerges from our present results for DIS at strong coupling. When\nanalyzed in view of Eq. (5.3) (with Nc \u2192 Nc2 \u2212 1 \u2248 Nc2 , to account for the proper number of\ncolor degrees of freedom of the fields in N = 4 SYM), the estimate (4.38) for F2 suggests that,\nfor transverse momenta k\u22a5 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), the occupation numbers for the fermionic and scalar fields\nsaturate at a value of order 1. Note that, for fermions, this value n = 1 is in agreement with the\nmaximal occupancy allowed by the Pauli principle. Our analysis gives no direct access to the\ngluon occupancy, but in view of the supersymmetry of the underlying theory, we expect a similar\nsaturation value, ng \u223c 1 for k\u22a5 <\n\u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), for the gluons as well. This value is quite reasonable:\nat small coupling, one needs a high occupancy ng \u223c 1/\u1fb1s \u226b 1 in order to compensate for\nthe weakness of the interactions, but when the coupling is strong, the gluons mutual repulsion\nresponsible for saturation becomes important already when ng \u223c 1.\nBy pushing this interpretation towards larger virtualities Q2 \u226b Q2s (\u03c4 ), where Eq. (4.39)\napplies, one finds that, when increasing k\u22a5 above Qs (\u03c4 ), the (scalar and fermion) occupation\n2 )2 . Assuming that this behaviour extends to\nnumbers decrease very fast, as n \u223c (Q2s (\u03c4 )/k\u22a5\ngluons as well, we deduce that, at strong coupling, there are essentially no partons at transverse\nmomenta above the saturation scale: at large k\u22a5 , the spectrum converges so fast that any\ninteresting convolution involving the integral of n(\u03c4, k\u22a5 ) over k\u22a5 will be dominated by k\u22a5 <\n\u223c\nQs (\u03c4 ). Equivalently, when the hadron is probed with a given transverse resolution scale Q2 ,\nalmost all partons appear to live at very small values of x, or large values of \u03c4 \u2261 ln(1/x), above\nthe saturation line: \u03c4 > \u03c4s (Q2 ). Since, on the other hand, such small\u2013x partons carry only little\nlongitudinal momentum, it is natural to find that the energy\u2013momentum sum rule is dominated\nby those partons living along the saturation line, as shown by Eq. (4.37).\n\nIt is interesting to notice that the 'phase diagram' in Fig. 3, or, more precisely, a slice of it\nat fixed \u03c4 , bears some resemblance to a previous scenario for high\u2013energy string scattering in\nflat space by Amati et al [12], after replacing the impact parameter b of Ref. [12] by the photon\nvirtuality Q2 . Specifically, both pictures have in common the dominance of the diffractive over\nthe inelastic cross\u2013section at large values of \u03c1 (with \u03c1 = ln Q2 in the present context and \u03c1 = b\nin the case of Ref. [12]) and for sufficiently large values of \u03c4 . But a closer inspection reveals\nalso some important differences between these two pictures, which can be attributed to our use\nof a nontrivial background metric. In particular, and unlike in Ref. [12], in our present analysis\nthere is no hierarchy between the elastic and diffractive processes: they all contribute on the\nsame footing and simultaneously become large on the 'elastic line' in Eq. (4.29).\nConsider finally the corner of the 'phase diagram' at ultrahigh energies s & Nc4 which in\nFig. 3 is referred to as 'strong gravity'. This is the region where the square of the momentum\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\ftransferred in the u direction, t = ku ku = Guu ku ku , which grows with s like tu (s) \u221d s2 (see\nthe Appendix) becomes of the same order as the total energy squared s, meaning that the\neikonal approximation cannot be trusted anymore. Physically, this is generally interpreted (so\nfar, mostly in the context of flat space analyses [12, 46, 47]) as the onset of non\u2013linear gravity\neffects, possibly associated with the formation of a black hole. In this regime, the graviton\nself\u2013interactions cannot be neglected anymore, so in the context of the scattering problem one\nhas to resum an infinite number of interacting gravitons in the t\u2013channel. This is reminiscent of\nthe non\u2013linear, strong gluon field problem of pQCD in the saturation regime [29, 7, 8, 9, 30, 48].\nIt would be therefore interesting to see if the similarity between the two phenomena could be\nmade even sharper.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to R.
