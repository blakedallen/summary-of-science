For example one\nwishes to determine, as accurately as possible, the fundamentals of the QCD and electroweak theories, such as \u03b1s , quark masses,\nand the elements of the CKM matrix. One\nalso needs precise information about 'pseudofundamentals,' quantities such as parton distribution functions (PDFs) that could be\npredicted if we knew how to solve nonperturbative QCD, but which currently must\nbe deduced from experimental data. Finally,\none puts this information together to predict\nthe QCD aspects of both backgrounds and\nsignals at high energy colliders, particularly\nat the Tevatron and LHC, to help maximise\nthe chance of discovering and understanding\nany new physics.\nOther facets of QCD research seek to extend the boundaries of our knowledge of QCD\nitself. The underlying Yang-Mills field theory\nis rich in its own right, and unexpected new\nperturbative structures have emerged in the\npast two years from considerations of string\ntheory. In the high-energy limit of QCD it is\nbelieved that a new state appears, the widely\nstudied colour glass condensate, which still\nremains to be well understood. And perhaps\nthe most challenging problem of QCD is that\nof how to relate the partonic and hadronic\ndegrees of freedom.\n\nGiven the practical importance of QCD\nfor the upcoming LHC programme, this talk\nwill concentrate on results (mostly since the\n2003 Lepton-Photon symposium) that bring\nus closer to the well-defined goals mentioned\nin the first paragraph. Some of the more explorative aspects will also be encountered as\nwe go along, and one should remember that\nthere is constant cross-talk between the two.\nFor example: improved understanding of field\ntheory helps us make better predictions for\nmulti-jet events, which are important backgrounds to new physics; and by comparing\ndata to accurate perturbative predictions one\ncan attempt to isolate and better understand\nthe parton-hadron interface.\nThe first part of this writeup will be\ndevoted to results at fixed order. At tree\nlevel we will examine new calculational methods that are much more efficient than Feynman graphs; we will then consider NLO and\nNNLO calculations and look at the issues\nthat arise in going from the Feynman graphs\nto useful predictions.\nOne of the main uses of fixed-order order\npredictions is for understanding rare events,\nthose with extra jets. In the second part of\nthe writeup we shall instead turn to resummations, which help us understand the properties of typical events.\nThroughout, the emphasis will be on the\nconceptual advances rather than the detailed\nphenomenology. Due to lack of space, some\nactive current topics will not be covered, in\n\n\fparticular exclusive QCD. Others are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings.1\n2\n\nFixed-order calculations\n\n2.1\n\nTree-level amplitudes and twistors\n\nMany searches for new physics involve signatures with a large number of final-state jets.\nEven for as basic a process as tt\u0304 production,\nthe most common decay channel (branching\nratio of 46%), tt\u0304 \u2192 bb\u0304W + W \u2212 \u2192 bb\u0304qq q\u0304 q\u0304 involves 6 final-state jets, to which there are\nlarge QCD multi-jet backgrounds.2 And at\nthe LHC, with 10 fb\u22121 (1 year) of data, one\nexpects of the order of 2000 events with 8 or\nmore jets3 (pt (jet) > 60 GeV, \u03b8ij > 30 deg,\n|yi | < 3).\nFor configurations with such large numbers of jets, even tree-level calculations become a challenge - for instance gg \u2192\n8g involves 10525900 Feynman diagrams\n(see ref.4 ).\nIn the 1980's, techniques\nwere developed to reduce the complexity\nof such calculations.5 Among them colour\ndecomposition,6 where one separates the\ncolour and Lorentz structure of the amplitude,\nX\nAtree (1, 2, . . . , n) = g n\u22122\n\nplitudes with arbitrary numbers of legs, and\nwith these and further techniques,10 numerous programs (e.g. MadEvent,11 ALPGEN,12\nHELAC/PHEGAS,13\nCompHEP,14 GRACE,15 Amegic16 ) are able\nto provide results for processes with up to 10\nlegs.\nThe past two years have seen substantial\nunexpected progress in the understanding of\nmulti-leg tree-level processes. It was initiated\nby the observation (first made by Nair17 ) that\nhelicity amplitudes have a particularly simple form in 'twistor' space, a space where a\nFourier transform has been carried out with\nrespect to just positive helicity spinors. In\ntwistor space a duality appears18 between\nthe weakly-coupled regimes of a topological\nstring theory and N = 4 SUSY Yang-Mills.\nThis has led to the postulation, by Cachazo, Svrcek and Witten (CSW),19 of rules\nfor deriving non-MHV N = 4 SUSY amplitudes from MHV ones, illustrated in fig. 1.\nFor purely gluonic amplitudes the results are\nidentical to plain QCD,20 because tree level\nSUSY amplitudes whose external legs are gluons have only gluonic propagators.\n1\n\nn+\n\n\u2212 \u22122\n\u22123\n+4\n+5\n\nperms\n\nTr(T1 T2 . . .

Graphical illustration of the CSW rules:\nby joining together two MHV amplitudes with an offshell scalar propagator one obtains an amplitude with\nan extra negative helicity (NMHV).\n\nRecently a perhaps even more powerful\nset of recursion relations was proposed by\nBritto, Cachazo and Feng (BCF),21 which\nallows one to build a general n-leg diagram\nby joining together pairs of on-shell subdiagrams. This is made possible by continuing a pair of reference momenta into the\ncomplex plane. The proof22 of these relations\n(and subsequently also of the CSW rules23 ) is\nremarkably simple, based just on the planar\n\n\fnature of colour-ordered tree diagrams, their\nanalyticity structure, and the asymptotic behaviour of known MHV amplitudes.\nThe discovery of the CSW and BCF\nrecursion relations has spurred intense activity, about 150 articles citing the original papers18,19 having appeared in the 18\nmonths following their publication. Questions addressed include the derivation of simple expressions for specific amplitudes,24 the\nsearch for computationally efficient recursive\nformulations,25 extensions to processes with\nfermions and gluinos,26 Higgs bosons,27 electroweak bosons,28 gravity,29 and the study of\nmulti-gluon collinear limits.30 This list is necessarily incomplete and further references can\nbe found in a recent review31 as well as below,\nwhen we discuss applications to loop amplitudes.\n\n2.2\n\nOne-loop amplitudes\n\nFor quantitatively reliable predictions of\na given process it is necessary for it to\nhave been calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO). A wide variety of NLO calculations exists, usually in the form of publicly available programs,32 that allow one to\nmake predictions for arbitrary observables\nwithin a given process. The broadest of these\nprograms are the MCFM,33 NLOJET34 and\nPHOX35 families.\nFor a 2 \u2192 n process the NLO calculation involves the 2 \u2192 n + 1 tree-level diagram, the 2 \u2192 n 1-loop diagram, and some\nmethod for combining the tree-level matrix\nelement with the loop contributions, so as to\ncancel the infrared and collinear divergences\npresent in both with opposite signs. We\nhave seen above that tree-level calculations\nare well understood, and dipole subtraction36\nprovides a general prescription for combining\nthem with the corrresponding 1-loop contributions. The bottleneck in such calculations\nremains the determination of the 1-loop contribution. Currently, 2 \u2192 3 processes are\n\nfeasible, though still difficult, while as yet no\nfull 2 \u2192 4 1-loop QCD calculation has been\ncompleted.\nIn view of the difficulty of these loop calculations, a welcome development has been\nthe compilation, by theorists and experimenters at the Les Houches 2005 workshop,\nPhysics at TeV Colliders,37 of a realistic prioritised wish-list of processes. Among the\nmost interesting remaining 2 \u2192 3 processes\none has pp \u2192 W W +jet, pp \u2192 V V V (V = W\nor Z) and pp \u2192 H + 2 jets. The latter can\nbe considered a 'background' to Higgs production via vector boson fusion, insofar as\nthe isolation of the vector-boson fusion channel for Higgs production would allow relatively accurate measurements of the Higgs\ncouplings.38 A number of 2 \u2192 4 processes\nare listed as backgrounds to tt\u0304H production\n(pp \u2192 tt\u0304q q\u0304, tt\u0304bb\u0304), W W \u2192 H \u2192 W W or\nto general new physics (pp \u2192 V + 3 jets) or\nspecifically SUSY (pp \u2192 V V V + jet).\nTwo broad classes of techniques have\nbeen used in the past for 1-loop calculations: those based directly on the evaluation\nof the Feynman diagrams (sometimes for the\n1-loop-tree interference39 ) and those based on\nunitarity techniques to sew together tree diagrams (see the review40 ). Both approaches\nare still being actively pursued.\nToday's direct evaluations of 1-loop contributions have, as a starting point, the automated generation of the full set of Feynman\ndiagrams, using tools such as QGRAF41 and\nFeynArts.42 The results can be expressed in\nterms of sums of products of group-theoretic\n(e.g. colour) factors and tensor one-loop integrals, such as\nZ\nl\u03bc1 . . . l\u03bci\nIn;\u03bc1 ..\u03bci = d4+2\u01eb l\n(l + k1 )2 . . . (l + kn )2\n(3)\nReduction procedures exist (e.g.43,44 ) that\ncan be applied recursively so as to express\nthe In;\u03bc1 ..\u03bci in terms of known scalar integrals. Such techniques form the basis of recent proposals for automating the evaluation\n\n\fof the integrals, where the recursion relations are solved by a combination of analytical and numerical methods,45 or purely\nnumerically,46,47,48 in some cases with special care as regards divergences that appear\nin the coefficients of individual terms of the\nrecursion relation but vanish in the sum.47,49\nResults from these approaches include a new\ncompact form for gg \u2192 g\u03b3\u03b3 at 1 loop50\nand the 1-loop contribution to the 'priority'\npp \u2192 H + 2 jets process.51 Related automated approaches have also been developed\nin the context of electroweak calculations,52\nwhere recently a first 2 \u2192 4 1-loop result\n(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4 fermions) was obtained.53\nAnother approach54 proposes subtraction terms for arbitrary 1-loop graphs, such\nthat the remaining part of the loop integral\ncan carried out numerically in 4 dimensions.\nThe subtraction terms themselves can be integrated analytically for the sum over graphs\nand reproduce all infrared, collinear and ultraviolet divergences.\nThe above methods are all subject to the\nproblem of the rapidly increasing number of\ngraphs for multi-leg processes. On the other\nhand, procedures based on 'sewing' together\ntree graphs to obtain loop graphs40 (cut constructibility approach) can potentially benefit from the simplifications that emerge from\ntwistor developments for tree graphs. This\nworks best for N = 4 SUSY QCD, where\ncancellations between scalars, fermions and\nvector particles makes the 'sewing' procedure\nsimplest and for example all gluonic (and\nsome scalar and gluino) NMHV 1-loop helicity amplitudes are now known;55 also, conjectures for N = 4 SUSY n-leg MHV planar graphs, at any number of loops, based\non 4-gluon two and three-loop calculations,56\nhave now been explicitly verified for 5 and\n6 gluon two-loop amplitudes.57 For N =\n1 SUSY QCD, known results for all MHV\namplitudes58 have been reproduced59 and\nnew results exist for some all-n NMHV\ngraphs60 as well as full results for 6 gluons.61\n\nFor plain QCD, progress has been slower,\nthough all finite 1-loop graphs (+ + + + . . .,\n\u2212 + + + . . .) were recently presented62 and\nunderstanding has also been achieved for divergent graphs,63 including the full result for\nall 1-loop (\u2212\u2212+++ . . .) MHV graphs.64 The\nprospects for the twistor-inspired approach\nare promising and one can hope that it will\nsoon become practically competitive with the\ndirect evaluation methods.\n\n2.3\n\nNNLO jet calculations\n\nNNLO predictions are of interest for many\nreasons: in those processes where the perturbative series has good convergence they can\nhelp bring perturbative QCD predictions to\nthe percent accuracy level. In cases where\nthere are signs of poor convergence at NLO\nthey will hopefully improve the robustness\nof predictions and, in all cases, give indications of the reliability of the series expansion. Finally they may provide insight in\nthe discussion of the relative importance of\nhadronisation and higher-order perturbative\ncorrections.65,66,67\nSo far, NNLO predictions are available\nmostly only for processes with 3 external\nlegs, such as the total cross section for Z \u2192\nhadrons or the inclusive pp \u2192 W, Z 68,69,70 or\nHiggs69,71,72 cross sections. A full list is given\nin table 1 of Stirling's ICHEP writeup.73\nMost current effort is being directed to\nthe e+ e\u2212 \u2192 3 jets process, where NLO corrections are often large, and where one is\nfree of complications from incoming coloured\nparticles. The ingredients that are needed\nare the squared 5-parton tree level (M5 ) and\n3-parton 1-loop (M3a ) amplitudes, and the\ninterference between 4-parton tree and 1loop (M4 ), and between 3-parton tree and 2loop amplitudes (M3b ), all of which are now\nknown (for references see introduction of74 ).\nA full NNLO prediction adds the integrals\nover phase-space of these contributions, multiplied by some jet-observable function J that\n\n\fdepends on the momenta pi\nZ\nJN N LO = dD\u03a65 M5 J(p1..5 ) +\nZ\nZ\nD\nd \u03a64 M4 J(p1..4 )+ dD\u03a63 (M3a+b )J(p1..3 ) .\nEach of the terms is infrared and collinear\n(IRC) divergent, because of the phase space\nintegration (M4,5 ) and/or the loop integral\n(M3,4 ). The current bottleneck for such calculations is in cancelling these divergences for\nan arbitrary (IRC safe) J.\nA standard approach at NLO is to introduce subtraction terms (e.g. in the dipole36\nformalism), schematically,\nZ\n4\u2212jet\nJN\n=\ndD\u03a65 (M5 J(p1..5 ) \u2212 S5 J(p\u03031..4 ))\nLO\nZ\n+ dD\u03a64 (M4 J(p1..4 ) + S4 J(p1..4 ))\nsuch that each integral is separately finite\nand that, alone, the S5 and S4 terms integrate to equal and opposite divergent contributions (they both multiply the same 4parton jet function J(p1..4 ) and the p\u03031..4 are\na specifically designed function of the p1..5 ).\nAt NNLO a similar method can be envisaged,\nand considerable work has gone towards developing a general formalism.75,76,77,78,79,74\nAn\nalternative\napproach, sector decomposition,80,81,82,83 introduces special distributions f\u2212i (involving\nplus-functions, like those in splitting functions), which isolate the \u01eb\u2212i divergent piece\nof a given integral (\u01eb = (D \u2212 4)/2),\nZ\n\nZ\n1\ndD\u03a65 M5 J(p1..5 ) = 4 d4\u03a65 f\u22124 M5 J(p1..5 )\n\u01eb\nZ\n1\n4\n+ 3 d \u03a65 f\u22123 M5 J(p1..5 ) + . . . ,\n\u01eb\n\nwhere the integration is performed in transformed variables that simplify the separation\nof divergences. In such an approach one thus\nobtains separate results for each power of \u01eb in\nboth real and virtual terms, making it easy\nto combine them.\nA useful testing ground for a number of these approaches has been e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n\n2 jets.83,84,78 Fundamentally new results are\nthe differential distributions for W, Z, H\nproduction85 in the sector-decomposition approach and the (\u03b1s CF /2\u03c0)3 contribution to\nh1 \u2212 Thrusti in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 3 jets, \u221220.4 \u00b1 4, in\nthe 'antenna' subtraction approach.74\n\n2.4\n\nNNLO splitting functions\n\nThe landmark calculation of 2004 was probably that of the NNLO splitting functions by\nMoch, Vermaseren and Vogt86 (MVV). These\nare important for accurate DGLAP evolution\nof the parton distributions, as extracted from\nfixed target, HERA and Tevatron data, up to\nLHC scales.\nThe results for the splitting functions\ntake about 15 pages to express, though the\nauthors have also provided compact approximations for practical use. These are gradually being adopted in NNLO fits.87,88 Mostly\nthe NNLO splitting functions are quite similar to the estimates obtained a few years\nago89 based on a subset of the moments and\nknown asymptotic limits. In particular it remains true that the NNLO corrections are in\ngeneral small, both compared to NLO and in\nabsolute terms. The worst region is that of\nsmall x for the singlet distributions, shown in\nfig. 2, where the NLO corrections were large\nand there is a significant NNLO modification\nas well. Studies of small-x resummation suggest that further high-order effects should be\nmodest,90,91 though so far only the gluon sector has been studied in detail.\nAnother potentially dangerous region is\nthat of large x: the splitting functions converge well, but the coefficient functions have\n[\u03b1ns ln2n\u22121 (1 \u2212 x)]/(1 \u2212 x) enhancements.\nThere are suggestions that the all-order inclusion of these enhancements via a threshold resummation may help improve the accuracy of PDF determinations.92 Fresh results\nfrom the MVV group,93 for the third order\nelectromagnetic coefficient functions, quark\nand gluon form factors, and new threshold\n\n\f0.4\n\nd ln q S / d ln \u03bc f2\n\u03bcr = \u03bcf\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nLO\nNLO\n\n\u22120.2\n\nNNLO\n\u22120.4\n\u22125\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nx\nFigure 2. Impact86 of NNLO DGLAP corrections on\nthe\nP derivative of a toy singlet quark distribution qS =\ni (qi + q\u0304i ).\n\nresummation coefficients should provide the\nnecessary elements for yet higher accuracy at\nlarge x. Together with the large-x part of\nthe NNLO splitting functions these have been\nused as inputs to the N3 LO soft-collinear enhanced terms for the Drell-Yan and Higgs\ncross sections.94,95\nFinally, as splitting-function calculations approach accuracies the 1% level, one\nshould consider also the relevance of QED\ncorrections.87,96\n2.5\n\nOther accuracy-related issues\n\nIn view of the efforts being devoted to improving the accuracy of theoretical predictions, it is disheartening to discover that\nthere are still situations where accuracy\nis needlessly squandered through incorrect\ndata-theory comparisons. This is the case\nfor the inclusive jet cross sections in the cone\nalgorithm at the Tevatron, where a parameter Rsep = 1.3 is introduced in the cone algorithm used for the NLO calculation (see\ne.g.97 ), but not in the cone algorithm applied to the data. Rsep is the multiple of the\ncone radius beyond which a pair of partons is\nnot recombined. It dates to early theoretical\n\nwork98 on NLO corrections to the cone algorithm in hadron collisions, when there was\nno public information on the exact jet algorithm used by the experiments: Rsep was introduced to parametrise that ignorance.\nThe use of Rsep in just the theory introduces a spurious NLO correction (at the\n5 \u2212 10% level98 ), meaning that the datatheory comparisons are only good to LO.\nThe size of the discrepancy is comparable\nto the NLO theory uncertainty. As this is\nsmaller than experimental errors, for now the\npractical impact is limited. However, as accuracies improve it is essential that theoryexperiment comparisons be done consistently,\nbe it with properly used cone algorithms99 or\nwith the (more straightforward and powerful) kt algorithm,100 which is finally starting\nto be investigated.101\nAn accuracy issue that is easily overlooked when discussing QCD developments\nis the non-negligible impact of electroweak effects at large scales. The subject has mostly\nbeen investigated for leptonic initial and final\nstates at a linear collider (ILC). The dominant contributions go as \u03b1EW ln2 Pt /MW .\nSince the LHC can reach transverse momenta\n(Pt ) an order of magnitude larger than the\nILC the electroweak effects are very considerably enhanced at the LHC, being up to\n30 \u2212 40%.102,103 Among the issues still to be\nunderstood in such calculations (related to\nthe cancellation of real and virtual corrections) is the question of whether experiments\nwill include events with W and Z's as part of\ntheir normal QCD event sample, or whether\ninstead such events will be treated separately.\n3\n\nAll-order calculations\n\nAll-order calculations in QCD are based on\nthe resummation of logarithmically dominant\ncontributions at each order. Such calculations are necessary if one is to investigate the\nproperties of typical events, for which each\nextra power of \u03b1s is accompanied by large\n\n\fsoft and collinear logarithms.\nThe two main ways of obtaining allorder resummed predictions are with exclusive Monte Carlo event generators, and with\nanalytical resummations. The former provide\nmoderately accurate (leading log (LL) and\nsome parts of NLL) predictions very flexibly\nfor a wide variety of processes, with hadronisation models included. The latter are able\nto provide the highest accuracy (at parton\nlevel), but usually need to be carried out\nby hand (painfully) for each new observable\nand/or process. All-order calculations are\nalso used in small-x and saturation physics,\nwhich will be discussed briefly at the end of\nthis section.\n\n3.1\n\nsation algorithms are largely based on those\nof Pythia, and which is already functional for\nhadron collisions.\nIn both the Pythia and Herwig 'camps'\nthere have been developments on new showering algorithms. Herwig++ incorporates an\nimproved angular-ordered shower112 in which\nthe 'unpopulated' phase space regions have\nbeen shrunk. Pythia 6.3 has a new parton shower113 based on transverse momentum ordering (i.e. somewhat like Ariadne)\nwhich provides an improved description of\ne+ e\u2212 event-shape data and facilitates the\nmodelling of multiple interactions in hadron\ncollisions. Separately, investigations of alternatives to standard leading-log backward\nevolution algorithms for initial-state showers\nare also being pursued.114,115\n\nMonte Carlo event generators (MC)\n\nVarious issues are present in current work on\nevent generators - the switch from Fortran\nto C++; improvements in the showering algorithms and the modelling of the underlying\nevent; and the inclusion of information from\nfixed-order calculations.\nThe motivation for moving to C++ is the\nneed for a more modern and structured programming language than Fortran 77. C++\nis then a natural choice, in view both of its\nflexibility and its widespread use in the experimental community.\nOriginally\nit\nwas\nintended that Herwig104 , Pythia105 and\nAriadne/LDC106,107 should all make use of\na general C++ event generator framework\nknown as ThePEG.108 Herwig++,109 based\non ThePEG, was recently released for e+ e\u2212\nand work is in progress for a hadron-hadron\nversion. Pythia 7 was supposed to have been\nthe Pythia successor based on the ThePEG,\nhowever instead a standalone C++ generator Pythia 8 is now being developed,110\nperhaps to be interfaced to ThePEG later\non. Another independent C++ event generator has also recently become available,\nSHERPA,111 whose showering and hadroni-\n\n3.2\n\nMatching MC & fixed order\n\nEvent generators reproduce the emission patterns for soft and collinear gluons and also\nincorporate good models of the transition to\nhadrons. They are less able to deal with\nmultiple hard emissions, which, as discussed\nabove, are important in many new particle\nsearches. There is therefore a need to combine event generators with fixed-order calculations.\nThe main approach for this is the\nCKKW116 proposal. Events are generated\nbased on the n-parton tree matrix elements\n(for various n), keeping an event only if its\nn partons are sufficiently well separated to\nbe considered as individual jets (according to\nsome threshold jet-distance measure, based\ne.g. on relative kt ). Each event is then assigned a 'best-guess' branching history, using which it can be reweighted with appropriate Sudakov form factors (to provide virtual corrections) and running couplings. The\nnormal parton showering is then added on to\neach event at scales below the threshold jetdistance measure. Over the past two years\nthis method has become widely adopted and\n\n\fis available in all major generators.117\nAs well as seeking to describe more jets\nit is also important to increase the accuracy\nof event generators for limited number of jets,\nby including NLO corrections. Here too there\nis one method that has so far dominated\npractical uses, known as MC@NLO.118 Very\nroughly, it takes the standard MC and modifies it according to\nMC \u2192 MC(1 + NLO \u2212 NLOMC ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere NLOMC represents the effective NLO\ncorrections present by default in the MC.\nSince the MC usually has the correct soft\nand collinear divergences, the combination\nNLO \u2212 NLOMC should be finite. Eq. (4)\nis therefore a well-behaved way of introducing exactly the correction needed to guarantee NLO correctness. A prediction from\nMC@NLO for b-production,119 figure 3, is\ncompared to data and a purely analytical\napproach,120 and one notes the good agreement between all three.\n\nto LO. An approach to alleviate both these\nproblems proposes121 to combine, for example, W , W + 1 jet, W + 2 jets, etc. with a procedure akin to CKKW. It seeks to alleviate\nthe problem of needing to calculate NLOMC\nas follows: when considering W + m jets the\n(m + 1)th emission (that needed for NLO accuracy) is generated not by the main MC,\nbut by a separate mini well-controlled generator, designed specifically for that purpose\nand whose NLO expansion is easily calculated (as is then the analogue of eq.(4)). The\nonly implementation of this so far (actually\nof an earlier, related formalism122 ) has been\nfor e+ e\u2212 .123\n3.3\n\nAnalytical resummations\n\nIt is in the context of analytical resummations that one can envisage the highest resummation accuracies, as well as the simplest matching to fixed order calculations.\nRather than directly calculating the distribution d\u03c3(V )/dV of an observable V , one often\nconsiders some integral transform F (\u03bd) of the\ndistribution so as to reduce F (\u03bd) to the form\nX\nln F (\u03bd) =\n(\u03b1ns Ln+1 + \u03b1ns Ln + . . .) , (5)\n| {z } | {z }\nn\nLL\n\nFigure 3. Spectrum for b-production (\u2192 J/\u03a8) compared to MC@NLO and an analytical prediction.120\n\nA bottleneck in widespread implementation of the MC@NLO approach is the need\nto know NLOMC , which is different for each\ngenerator, and even process. Furthermore\nMC@NLO so far guarantees NLO correctness only for a fixed number of jets - e.g.\nit can provide NLO corrections to W production, but then W + 1 jet is only provided\n\nNLL\n\nwith L = ln \u03bd.\nMuch of the information for certain\n3\nN LL threshold resummations was recently\nprovided by the MVV group.93 The highest accuracy for full phenomenological distributions is for the recently calculated\nHiggs transverse momentum spectrum124 at\nthe LHC and the related125 energy-energycorrelation (EEC) in e+ e\u2212 ,126 both of which\nhave also been matched to NLO fixed order.\nBoson transverse momentum spectra and\nthe EEC are among the simplest observables\nto resum. For more general observables and\nprocesses, such as event shapes or multi-jet\nevents, the highest accuracy obtained so far\nhas been NLL, and the calculations are both\ntedious and error-prone. This has prompted\n\n\fwork on understanding general features of resummation. One line of research127 examines the problem of so-called 'factorisable' observables, for an arbitrary process. This extends the understanding of large-angle soft\ncolour evolution logarithms, whose resummation was originally pioneered for 4-jet processes by the Stony Brook group,128,129 in\nwhich unexplained hidden symmetries were\nrecently discovered,130,131 notably between\nkinematic and colour variables.\nSeparately, the question of how to treat\ngeneral observables has led to a procedure for\nautomating resummations for a large class\nof event-shape-like observables.132 It avoids\nthe need to find an integral transform that\nfactorises the observable and introduces a\nnew concept, recursive infrared and collinear\nsafety, which is a sufficient condition for the\nexponentiated form eq. (5) to hold. Its main\napplication so far has been to hadron-collider\ndijet event shapes,133 (see also134 ) which provide opportunities for experimental investigation of soft-colour evolution and of hadronisation and the underlying event at the Tevatron\nand LHC.\nThe above resummations apply to\n'global' observables, those sensitive to radiation everywhere in an event. For non-global\nobservables, such as gap probabilities135 or\nproperties of individual jets,136,137 a new\nclass of enhanced term appears, non-global\nlogarithms \u03b1ns Ln (NGL), fig. 4. Their resummation has so far only been possible in the\nlarge-NC limit,136,138 though the observation\nof structure related to BFKL evolution,139\nhas inspired proposals for going to finite\nNC .140\nNon-global and soft colour resummations (in non-inclusive form129 ) come together when calculating the probability of\na gap between a pair of jets at the Tevatron/LHC, relevant as a background to the\nW fusion process for Higgs production.141\nRecently it has been pointed out that contributions that are subleading in 1/NC2 play an\n\nE2\nGAP\n\nE1\n\nEjet\nEjet >> E 1 >> E 2\n\nFigure 4. Diagram giving NGL: to calculate the probability of there being no emission into the gap, one\nshould resum a large-angle energy-ordered cascade of\nemissions rather than just direct emission from the\noriginal hard partons.\n\nimportant role for large gaps,142 and also that\nthere are considerable subtleties when using\na kt jet algorithm to to define the gap.143\n3.4\n\nSmall x and saturation\n\nThe rise of the gluon at small x, as predicted by BFKL,144 leads eventually to such\nhigh gluon densities that a 'saturation' phenomenon should at some point set in. Usually one discusses this in terms of a saturation scale, Q2s (x), below (above) which the\ngluon distribution is (un)saturated. From\nHERA data, it is believed that at x = x0 \u2243\n10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125, Qs is of order 1 GeV and that it\ngrows as Q2s (x) = (x/x0 )\u2212\u03bb GeV2 with \u03bb \u2243\n0.3.145 Qs may be of relevance to the LHC\nbecause the typical transverse scale Em of\nminimum bias minijets should satisfy the re2\n2\n, whose solution gives\n) \u223c Em\nlation Q2s (s/Em\n2\u2212\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2+\u03bb\n2+\u03bb\nGeV\n\u2243 2.7 \u2212 3.6 GeV, or\nEm \u223c (sx0 )\nif one doesn't trust the normalisation, a factor 1.7 relative to the Tevatron. The exact\nphenomenology is however delicate.146,147\nThe theoretical study of the saturation\nscale has seen intense activity these past 18\nmonths, spurred by two observations. Firstly\nit was pointed out148 that the BalitskyKovchegov (BK) equation, often used to describe the onset of saturation and the evolution d ln Q2s /d ln x, is in the same universality class as the Fisher Kolmogorov Petrovsky\nPiscounov (FKPP) reaction-diffusion equation, much studied in statistical physics149\nand whose travelling wave solutions relate to\n\n\fthe evolution of the saturation scale. Secondly, large corrections were discovered150\nwhen going beyond the BK mean-field approximation: to LO, \u03bbBK \u221d \u03b1s , while the\nnon mean-field corrections go as \u03b1s / ln2 \u03b12s .\nSuch corrections turn out to be a familiar phenomenon in stochastic versions of the\nFKPP equation, with \u03b12s in QCD playing\nthe role of the minimum particle density in\nreaction-diffusion systems with a finite number of particles.151 The stochastic corrections\nalso lead to a large event-by-event dispersion\nin the saturation scale.\nThese stochastic studies are mostly based\non educated guesses as to the form of the\nsmall-x evolution beyond the mean-field approximation. There has also been extensive\nwork on finding the full equation that replaces BK beyond the mean-field approximation, a number of new formulations having\nbeen proposed.152,153,154,155 It will be interesting to examine how their solutions compare to the statistical physics related approaches.\n4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOf the topics covered here, the one that has\nbeen the liveliest in the past year is that\nof 'twistors'.a Its full impact cannot yet be\ngauged, but the dynamic interaction between\nthe QCD and string-theory communities on\nthis subject will hopefully bring further important advances.\nMore generally one can ask if QCD is on\ntrack for the LHC. Progress over the past\nyears, both calculationally and phenomenologically (e.g. PDF fitting) has been steady.\nRemaining difficulties, for example in high\n(NNLO) and moderate (NLO) accuracy calculations are substantial, however the considerable number of novel ideas currently being\ndiscussed encourages one to believe that significant further advances will have been made\nby the time LHC turns on.\na Second\n\nplace goes to saturation.\n\nAcknowledgements\nMany people have helped with the preparation of this talk, through explanations\nof material I was unfamiliar with, suggestions of topics to include, and useful comments.\nAmong them: Z.
